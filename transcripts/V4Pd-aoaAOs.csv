0,5560," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session with Amista"
5560,12140," Zozin. So here we have a very simple demo for a very interesting library which is called"
12140,18640," Olivesi or Olivets depending on how you want to pronounce it and this library is rather cool in"
18640,25260," the sense that it doesn't use any sort of like graphical APIs by itself. All it does it renders"
25260,29340," everything into the array of pixels into the buffer of pixels that you're supposed to allocate"
29340,33620," yourself and then you can do whatever the hell you want with that array of pixels for example"
33620,41000," put them into html5 canvas. This is a c library this is generated by c library compiled to web"
41000,46160," assembly and then this library generated an array of pixels and we just put it into the html5 canvas"
46160,53600," it doesn't use webgl. It doesn't even use webgl2 and it doesn't use a web gpu it literally just uses"
53600,61140," html5 canvas because it grabs the array of pixels just grabs them put them into image data and just"
61140,68800," slaps the image data onto the html5 canvas. That's how it works that's how cool it is. So right so on the"
68800,76820," previous stream we were working on actually converting the obg file the obg file of this penguin called"
76820,83380," panger his name is panger right to a format where we can actually display it through this library"
83380,93860," but this particular obg file contains way more than just vertices and faces it contains also textures and we"
93860,101460," do not really display them because we don't really know how to do that yet. So today's stream is going to be dedicated to"
102180,112100," you know making the textures appear on this obg file right so um i think i tried to open that obg file"
112100,117780," through blender and i couldn't see the actual materials and stuff like that so obg file itself"
117780,124900," right and obg is a format for like a 3d uh 3d models and stuff like that so it has vertices as you can see"
124900,131460," it has additional things for normals right so here are the normals and then there is a textures right texture"
131460,137540," coordinates and stuff like that and after that come the faces which are the triangles essentially right"
137540,144420," and here is just like indices that corresponds to vertices uh texture coordinates and the normals and"
144420,152820," stuff like that uh so and also this particular obg file refers to a material file mtl right so which"
152820,160900," describes the material of the panger itself right uh so and it refers to a texture right so which is"
160900,166500," basically put on top of the panger so this is the texture but i mean it looks like a nonsense right"
166500,173060," but uh essentially it's up to the you know the texture coordinates to actually put everything in"
173060,179940," place so it looks good right that's kind of the point uh if i understand correctly um right so it's"
179940,189860," going to be rather interesting so our goal for today is going to be to understand the vertex coordinates and map"
189860,196660," them correspondingly to the uh png file and just display it as a texture luckily uh luckily we already"
196660,203540," know how to display textures on 3d faces right so in these demos which you can find in the description i'm"
203540,208900," going to put the link to this demo in the description we have this demo that demonstrates how you can do"
208900,214820," that right so essentially we have two triangles and we just put some textures on these two triangles so since"
214820,220580," we know how to do that we can port that to that demo uh right so we have a couple of 3d things in here"
220580,227940," uh right and we'll be able to to have like a texture on this penguin so uh somebody on discord warned me that"
227940,238020," the opg model is rather peculiar in the sense that it has a transparent shell around it so"
238020,245940," we have to be careful with this kind of stuff all right so so that means even if we um start handling"
245940,253140," the textures and texture coordinates we we may won't be able uh to see the actual texture of the penguin"
253140,260980," because the of the outer shell and outer shell serves as sort of like a hack to make the penguin look"
260980,266660," cartoonish uh right so it kind of makes sense when you look at it through the blender but we couldn't"
266660,271620," look through the blender because i couldn't know how to properly export it so somebody told me uh i think"
271620,277460," on youtube that you have to enable like a material mode or something like that so it recognized my"
277460,285220," material material file but it just we were not in the right sort of like mode or something uh so let's"
285220,296340," actually see so let me uh maybe go ahead and delete this cube and i'm going to try to export uh actually"
296340,302340," import the waveform so i don't know if i have to be legacy or not legacy it doesn't really tell me"
302340,309460," like what exactly it has to be so i'm going to copy paste this entire path in here uh so then i can"
309460,317940," just grab the obg file uh right so here it is and i don't really remember how you enable the uh okay"
317940,325300," material preview okay oh it actually became very slow i hope it's not going to kill my entire stream"
325300,339940," because oof so wireframe render it we can try to see maybe rendered uh yeah it doesn't look like anything"
339940,350260," honestly so i don't see any material in here uh oh here's the material though um top right corner"
350260,352820," button for showing the material"
352820,368900," i i don't see it anti-meta penguin the orbs dude there's so many things in here of these ones okay"
369460,380820," viewport shading uh like somewhere in the right top corner there is a button dude dude like somewhere"
380820,390740," in the right top corner there is a button to do this thing i swear to god blender people oh my god"
396180,404820," this is so fucking funny okay so uh there's this thing it doesn't do anything right so it's it's useless"
404820,412340," um i see i see okay so it's a waste of time i see it's a waste of time don't say all right"
412340,420260," so fuck all of that uh let's actually just jump into all of this entire thing and start maybe uh parsing"
420260,429220," all of the necessary information that we will need to make the textures appear uh right so let me actually"
429220,440500," see tools uh obg to see so the thing is the thing is um if we take a look at the um you know at the faces"
440500,449380," specifically let's actually find the face uh there are three triples right so basically there's nine"
449380,456340," numbers in here it's three triples so and the first value in the triple is the index of the vertex right"
456340,463460," so because phase is a triangle is a triangle and each vertex of the triangle is actually indexed in a global"
463460,469940," array of vertices right so and the other thing here is for each vertex i think it's the coordinates right"
469940,475700," so maybe coordinates or maybe normals and stuff like that so what i'm saying is that as of right now we"
475700,482660," only parse the first index in the triple right it's only the first index in the triple and the other two"
482660,490180," are simply ignored so the first thing in actually making it work probably would be to parse all of the indices"
490180,497140," in here uh right so the code that is responsible for parsing all of that is located in obg to see"
497140,506660," uh right and when we encounter a face i think it's just f yeah there we go so when we encounter a face"
506660,511540," we just do the textual parsing and stuff like that nothing particularly special and then we make a face"
511540,519860," right so there is a function that makes a face um so what's interesting is that it's just a structure"
519860,528500," of uh vertex indices it's a vertex indices so we'll need to introduce uh the indices for the"
528500,535460," vertex textures and the indices for the vertex uh what is that normals right so i'm thinking how we're"
535460,543220," going to be going about that so these names are very um obscure right so i would like to maybe rename"
543220,552340," them to something like the a vb vc to indicate that they are uh essentially the vertices right so maybe"
552340,560580," it would be better to even call them v1 zulu uh v2 and v3 right so then later i could introduce things like"
560580,571860," vt1 v2 2 and v2 3 right so vt and then also vn uh all right so and here we're gonna have like nine numbers in"
571860,580180," here right so we're gonna have nine numbers so it's gonna be v1 zulu v2 and v3 and in here let's just go"
580180,591380," ahead and do uh v1 for now and this one is gonna be v1 so v2 v3 and we just simply return the entire thing"
591380,599060," so we use this function only in a single place and i feel like i need to do the renaming uh in here as well"
599060,607220," as well um so i'm gonna just rename v1 uh v2 and v3 so that will break in all of the places"
607220,611220," and we're gonna just go through the compilation errors and fix them so i'm gonna do tools"
611220,619780," please break in all of the necessary places okay so here is the v1 uh v2 uh v3 so what's the next place"
619780,624980," okay so these are all of the three places okay so these are all of the three places so a is a v1 uh"
624980,633460," right so this is a v1 uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and this one is v2 maybe i could have just used"
634180,651300," replacing of this entire thing and this is v3 let's go v3 okay so that's v1 v2 v3 cool uh anything else"
651300,659380," i think that is almost it aha so we also need to do minus one because in obg files the indices are one based"
661220,667140," so this is like don't look at me like that okay so i didn't invent that format"
667140,672500," right so stop looking at me like that uh we just have to deal with this kind of ship based"
674580,683140," i swear to god people didn't you hear dextra dextra said one based indexing bad"
683140,689060," listen to dextra dextra also said that go to is bad"
689060,700340," dextra have said a lot of things angrily it would be kind of funny to see dextra living in the age of"
700340,709460," twitter honestly i think he would have had the most epic rants on twitter too bad he like and he"
709460,719220," even had to invent his own twitter to run on to rant on right because he wrote like this uh ewds"
719220,726180," basically so he put he he would write some rants and he would just mass print them on the printer or"
726180,731460," something like that on a photocopy and just mass produce them in his university that's how badly"
731460,740260," he needed twitter to rant on he just he was just born in a wrong age he literally was born in the wrong"
740260,746980," age he literally had to like print down his tweets and just distribute them physically right he was"
746980,752900," suffering like that if only he actually was born a little bit later so he could put all of that on"
752900,765220," twitter uh mega it was actually kind of funny um so it was like it was before the internet was like a very"
765220,771780," available thing so it basically was his physical blog essentially yeah he was ahead of his time honestly"
771780,782580," he was ahead of his time um born too soon to be shouted at by morons yeah i suppose i suppose i suppose"
782580,783860," okay"
783860,799060," i guess we didn't break anything everything seems to be working everything seems to be working so uh we need"
799060,804100," to start parsing the rest of the things so i think there was a to do oh yeah i even put myself a note"
804100,810900," look at that so i know now that the second thing in here is vt right so i freaking know that brother"
810900,813140," or freaking know that brother"
813140,824980," so essentially what did we do in here we parsed um so we have this thing right so we essentially have"
824980,836020," this thing and we parsed the uh stuff successfully so that means after doing this v chop left we chopped"
836020,842740," off this thing and then with this thing we're basically chopping everything off until we encounter"
842740,848500," like a space or whatever so what i'm thinking is that we have to do right so i'm going to put a comment in"
848500,856260," here is that after we chopped the number the first number that we parsed we need to take a look at whether"
856260,867300," the line starts with a slash right because that's an invitation to parse vt1 that's what it is it's an"
867300,877300," invitation to parse vt1 uh so how we can do that uh if data zero is equal to slash uh we have to chop that"
877300,883460," slash off right so chopping that slash off but we have to be a little bit careful uh that we're"
883460,887780," looking at the first character but the line may not have a first character so we need to first check"
887780,892820," that the line count is greater than zero right so that's what we need to check uh right it's greater"
892820,898980," than zero then we do that blah blah blah everything's good everything's tamaguchi so and after that"
898980,909540," we should try to parse vt1 right so vt1 right so vt1 but i think it should be available outside of the"
909540,916980," scope of this condition so i think we need to put vt1 uh we have to declare it in here so let's put zero"
916980,922260," in here indicating that it doesn't exist then we parse it like that uh right so then we parse it like"
922260,928580," that and then we chop it off like this so we also do a little bit of a checking of the ranges so we're"
928580,935540," competing the low uh index of the face and high index of the face this is needed for the statistics"
935540,942340," um we could do that for the textures as well but i don't think i really want to do it right now right so"
942340,949140," i'm not sure if i care about it that much but anyway so afterwards um after doing all of that"
949140,958740," um right so we essentially chopped off that slash uh in this line right then we chopped off this number"
958740,968020," with these two lines and effectively we parsed the vt1 cool so after that we probably want to repeat the"
968020,975140," whole thing but for vn right so we can even like literally copy paste this entire thing"
975140,984500," and just like query replace uh vt with vn right so vt with vn and it's gonna be basically basically that"
984500,989860," right so and after that if there's some additional stuff in here we just like don't really care about"
989860,996980," it uh we're just like you know chopping it off um that's about it i think uh we can even copy paste"
996980,1003700," now this entire thing twice for the second uh for the second thing right in front of this while"
1003700,1010820," but the thing we have to do in here is that we have to replace one with two so we replace um"
1010820,1016980," one with two but we have to be careful right so because we don't want to affect this one for instance"
1016980,1029300," right so let's ignore these things uh-huh like so uh and now we can copy paste this thing for the third"
1029300,1035060," one as well uh-huh so i'm going to just put it in here select this entire thing and replacing two with"
1035060,1042180," three is a little bit easier because we don't have any extra tools in here and effectively we parsed"
1042180,1047620," everything right so there is a little bit of duplication but i'm not sure if i want to fix"
1047620,1054020," that duplication we could actually we could actually fix it we could maybe factor out this entire thing"
1054020,1062660," into a separate function which accepts v1 v like v vt and vn as pointers to the integers and just like puts"
1062660,1069220," them there uh and that maybe you could compress this code just a bit right but the thing here is"
1069220,1074900," that now we have to pass all of these things into make face i suppose right so let's actually"
1074900,1083540," pass them into make face uh the way we can do that this one is going to be vt so this is vt and then i'm"
1083540,1092180," going to copy paste this one more time and replace with vt with vn vtv and boom right so this one is"
1092180,1104100," could replace v with vt boom and this one with uh t and boom look at that can your beam do that can your beam"
1104100,1118340," do that so yeah your beam can't do so now we have to pass all this information uh somewhere there right"
1118340,1128340," so let's do it like that so uh let's do it like that so this is correctly i forgot to put v"
1128340,1142820," query place v vt boom uh-huh and now boom uh vn could replace vtv and boom look at that look at that"
1143620,1150180," so we can try to now uh build the tools and see where it fails i'm in the wrong place so building"
1150180,1161220," that tools what's win that's a good question actually so get some uh beats from enumerate"
1161220,1165300," thank you so much for 100 beats uh with the message hello mr shooting good luck with the graphics thank"
1165300,1170180," you so much i met yourself 777 thank you so much for tier one with the message 69 with zozin"
1171620,1178500," oh you mean uh 16 yo it's a funny number it's a funny sex number thank you so much thank you"
1178500,1183780," so much for supporting me for so long thank you thank you thank you cheers by the way"
1183780,1191620," funny number funny number 69"
1195620,1208660," so yes we don't really do anything with these additional numbers right so we don't really do"
1208660,1215380," anything with them except storing them in memory so i don't really know how we want to you know approach"
1215380,1221460," all of that stuff so it would be interesting to maybe go through uh this process of parsing things in a"
1221460,1228340," debugger right so first of all let me just build all of this thing uh and on top of that i would like to"
1228340,1234340," maybe rebuild the assets right so everything seems to be fine in here right so everything seems to be"
1234340,1241620," fine and uh we probably want to rebuild the demos right so can i do demos uh and then uh wasm rebuild only"
1241620,1249460," the wasm demos uh no this is not how we do that out rebuild just everything i forgot how to i remember"
1249460,1254420," there was a way to just say okay rebuild only wasm demos now it rebuilds everything okay let's rebuild"
1254420,1260500," everything whatever so at ski thank you so much for twitch prime for 12 months thank you thank you thank you"
1260500,1272340," thank you thank you so it's sdl and terminal and stuff like that we need to check that we didn't break"
1272340,1280180," anything so because some of the obgs don't have that slash thing here that's a very important thing so we"
1280180,1286980," need to actually parse it in a way that ignores um that doesn't break the obgs without the slash things"
1287380,1292980," so if we take a look at the uta teapot and find the thing that starts with f there we go so as you can"
1292980,1300900," see here you have only the vertices right so some of those things are kind of optional right so and we"
1300900,1308980," need to have a code that supports all of that and doesn't break uh right at all so we do we have the"
1308980,1314420," python okay so i'm gonna just restart this entire thing and let's take a look at the"
1315220,1320500," demos okay so the demos are not broken everything is working everything is working one of the things"
1320500,1330180," i would like to do actually is to maybe when i do tools right so i'm running uh maybe assets actually"
1330180,1338420," right so that's what i'm doing so i'm running obg2c right so that's what i'm running like this cool"
1339060,1342660," and now what i want to do i want to actually do gf2"
1342660,1351940," right and i want to just open this entire thing in the debugger so where i'm going to be debugging in"
1351940,1356180," which place we're going to be debugging all of this entire stuff we're probably going to be debugging"
1356180,1368420," some way here it's a line 289 so break obg2c 289 all right so if you take a look at the break points so"
1368420,1374500," here is the place and let's actually run this i think with these parameters basically converting that"
1374500,1381540," panger uh panger uh all right so this is what we have on here we're looking at the line uh so let me"
1381540,1387140," bring all of that stuff a little bit closer to here so here is the line and as you can see we're looking"
1387140,1400420," at 23 1 23 which corresponds to the line somewhere in the assets uh obg file so it's a 21 slide 20 23"
1400420,1409060," right so 23 slash 1 so here it is so we're parsing the first phase so let's see how it will perform that"
1409060,1415380," let's see how it will perform so we might as well even take a look at things like v1 v2 v3 all right so"
1415380,1426180," and maybe vt1 vt2 vt3 and vn1 vn2 vn3 that's a lot of things in here but i mean i think it's fine"
1426180,1433540," all right so we parsing v1 v1 is 23 so we're just updating this kind of thing then we are chopping the"
1433540,1440340," number that we just parsed right so we initialize vt1 with zero that's fine so we see that this entire"
1440340,1445140," thing starts with the slash with chopping of the slash the slash has been chopped off then we"
1445140,1451700," assigning one to vt1 and then we chop your one chopping uh this thing off all right so the then"
1451700,1458020," we have slash we see that slash is there we removing it then we parse the next number and there we go so"
1458020,1469860," 23 1 23 v1 vt1 vn1 23 1 23 uh 23 1 23 we parse this entire thing successfully we can clearly see"
1469860,1475140," this entire thing so after that uh we just continue parsing the rest of the things right so"
1475140,1481540," we parse we want to in here and i think we can already safely say that this thing is working right"
1481540,1487300," so it's working as extend as expected and we just like parsed all of the indices in here pretty successfully"
1487300,1492420," i got the same right so we have all of that necessary information that we didn't have before right so now we"
1492420,1498260," know the indices of uh you know texture coordinates and the normals and stuff like that so that's pretty cool"
1498260,1506020," okay so uh dare cry thank you so much for uh gifting this sub uh bonds boss thank you so much for to try"
1506020,1512900," with the message it's panger time there is a new hidden secret page at panger city i think i know which one you're"
1512900,1521140," talking about uh all right so let me take a look at this thing so it's it's jedgar so and you can access"
1521140,1527380," so there is a jedgar in here and you can access it by actually clicking on him and so there is a jedgar page"
1528180,1534420," uh right so which plays very cool tune uh so actually kind of cool"
1534420,1542820," i can't i can't really hear it but"
1542820,1553220," yeah it is playing so maybe this is what we're going to be listening in the uh in the break we'll see we'll"
1553220,1561780," see okay so uh what we can do now i i feel like i want to actually factor it out all right so i feel"
1561780,1568740," like i want to factor it out i think it's going to be very very beneficial for us uh so let me let me"
1568740,1573220," see how we can do that so we need to come up with a name for the function that is going to be parsing the"
1573220,1581940," triple uh right so we can call it parse face triple is that a good name for this thing"
1582740,1591300," parse face triple uh all right and we probably want to start with passing the this thing um what's"
1591300,1596340," funny is that it's modifying the line so that means the line has to be passed by a pointer right so that's"
1596340,1604420," the first thing we're doing here um and also it is updating lfhf and lfhf are they global i don't"
1604420,1610500," think they're global actually uh yeah so they are not global so that means they also have to be passed"
1611540,1622500," by a reference all right so int lf int hf and most importantly uh we have to pass the v like everything"
1622500,1627300," like all of these things in here uh not really everything but we need to pass v which is a"
1627300,1637780," pointer then v uh t and uh vn right so all of these things will be passed by a pointer so what i'm thinking"
1637780,1643460," i need to go to the compilation errors in here so it's going to be that uh right so it's going to be"
1643460,1650180," no build not really nob right it's no build so this is the tools and uh let's go through the"
1650180,1656020," compilation errors okay so this is the line we have to dereference it no after dereferencing in c"
1656020,1662260," unfortunately this is not c3 but even in c3 our auto dereferencing is kind of limited right so i think"
1662980,1667780," auto dereferencing works a little bit better in jai but i don't remember the rules of auto dereferencing"
1667780,1673940," and jai honestly uh i don't remember them right but i can remember that they were rather convenient"
1673940,1679460," uh right so yeah you you didn't have to even think about it too much right so it was pretty straightforward"
1679460,1685060," to just change from passing by value to passing by reference right and this is something that i really"
1685060,1690820," like but in c not only i have to like now put all these stars in here and shut like that i also have to"
1690820,1698180," replace the dots with arrows freaking classic problem uh right so there's also end ptr uh which probably"
1698180,1704260," going to be a local variable uh here somewhere so how do i declare it so it's basically just appointed"
1704260,1711380," to the character so i'm going to put this stuff in here uh right so yes we used to use"
1715060,1724100," and let's actually maybe do something like v1 v uh does it look even good i'm not sure if it even"
1724100,1730660," looks good but one um upside is that uh here i don't have to take a reference because line is already"
1730660,1737300," a reference right i don't have to take a reference in here so in here we have vt and i might as well just"
1737300,1743780," quickly create place vt one with just vt boom boom there you go so in all the places where we take the"
1743780,1753300," pointer i don't have to do that but here i have to do this kind of thing c am i right extremely ergonomic"
1753300,1761540," language extremely ergonomic language still somehow more ergonomic than rust but that's that's a story for"
1761540,1771060," another time uh so let's go replace vn one with vn boom boom uh maybe i'm gonna query replace ampersand"
1771060,1779060," line with just line can i do that i apparently can't do that um so and in here yeah so that seems to be"
1779060,1787060," fine and also query place line dot with the line arrow boom boom boom boom boom i want you to my room"
1788660,1798580," okay spend the night together together so a bunch of useless changes uh right so i probably have to do"
1798580,1805380," this kind of thing um so a bunch of useless changes and i think we are ready to try to compile this entire"
1805380,1811620," thing and i do not guarantee that it's going to work after that uh right is it going to work after that"
1811620,1817780," uh no it doesn't work after that because you uh because yeah i have to do reference this and oh my"
1817780,1823060," god this is so this is so anal like yeah i have to"
1823060,1833700," look at this piece of code look at this look it's like oh my god all of them has to be"
1833700,1845380," uh look honestly this thing would have been much better as a macro that's for sure because it just like"
1845380,1851460," wants to have this thing in the glow in the local scope right so and that's basically what we end up"
1851460,1858820," with so this is a job for a macro but multi-line macros uh multi-line macros in c are an absolute"
1858820,1865860," ass uh so it is what it is and it isn't what it is and so we're basically passing an entire freaking"
1865860,1871220," scope by a reference just to you know collapse a little bit of a code and i'm not sure if it's even"
1871220,1877540," worth it after that so we'll see we'll see how it goes all right so why data what the is why data"
1877540,1886580," uh it's just a data why data why all right so we did it uh they're fine just scope them uh"
1886580,1895620," yeah i guess i don't know scope them scoping them i don't know uh let's go and find a place where we do"
1895620,1903300," all of that so that function will enable us to replace a single code replace a single chunk of"
1903300,1912420," code like this hopefully we don't know yet so uh parse phase triple let's go back in here uh right"
1912420,1920980," so and essentially i can now pass this thing by a pointer and all of these things by a pointer like so"
1920980,1930260," boom and this one is going to be v1 uh t1 and n1 so and that replaces the whole chunk in here"
1930260,1938260," and in fact i can now do query replace one to two boom and that replaces another chunk and i can do"
1938260,1946660," two replace with three and that replaces another chunk boom look at that look at that so now when i"
1946660,1953780," encounter a face i parse first phase triple then i parse the second phase triple and the third phase"
1953780,1960180," triple and all of the information that i parsed i just make a face out of that so i guess it was worth"
1960180,1966740," it at the end of the day you were laughing at me with all of the stars and pointers but look how much we"
1966740,1976100," compressed mate look how much we compress isn't that pollers look at that clean code look at that"
1976100,1985220," is that a clean code it's epic mate so yeah um that's pretty cool and we don't even need to have"
1985220,1990100," end pointer in here anymore well we don't know if it compiles or not so but uh yeah we'll see we'll see"
1990740,1998740," uh i want to kind of go to parse face triple and i just want to put some information of what goes where"
1998740,2005620," and but i mean it's already there right so uh so first comes v then vt and then vn we don't have to do"
2005620,2012420," anything uh all right so let's try to uh compile this entire thing so this is the tools and it doesn't"
2012420,2018180," even fucking compile me doesn't even fucking compile why oh because i never allocated on any of these"
2018180,2024100," motherfuckers that's why that's literally why because i forgot to allocate all of them uh so"
2024100,2031220," let's actually put a comma in here and um you know what this is the first time when this feature of c is"
2031220,2038340," kind of convenient look at that that's kind of convenient and i just like allocate like all these"
2038340,2045460," variables then i'm passing the triplets of these variables into this function there you go uh right so"
2046020,2062820," you can't get the first time we showed those doubters their place"
2071620,2081620," so when you start it looks like the american flag hey brother okay cool okay so the code of freedom"
2081620,2086740," there should be 50 of them actually"
2086740,2097140," it works it it works uh so i don't really know if it works actually so let's let's rebuild the assets the"
2097140,2102580," assets don't really break that much there's warnings but those warnings are kind of uh key code yeah"
2102580,2110820," key code uh but those warnings are kind of expected so let me see how we do so can you do help oh we"
2110820,2122100," we have help right so i can do yo i can do demos and then i can do platform i can do wasm uh no such directory so"
2123620,2128340," this is a light who wrote this code"
2128340,2130980," no no no"
2130980,2135860," who wrote this code bravo"
2135860,2141380," the fuck anyways whatever uh i don't care what exactly does but"
2141380,2148100," anyways anyways anyways anyways so maybe i can take a look at the no building because i want to only want to"
2148100,2154980," rebuild the wasm logos uh demos not logos uh so let me see so here's the demos"
2154980,2159460," and uh then we look at some arguments"
2159460,2165860," and then wasm and then we're looking at the name"
2168260,2169700," uh it's kind of sus"
2169700,2180740," screen says build sdl demo but then it expects the name of the demo i suppose all right that's what's"
2180740,2189940," going on in here so no build demos wasm uh panger right so that's what that still doesn't work it doesn't"
2190660,2197060," once a month run i don't remember how to use my own build system so whatever"
2197060,2198420," fuck that"
2198420,2207860," uh so demo demo name platform run oh okay i see so maybe that's what we have to do you know better"
2207860,2212180," uh so panger uh yeah no file it's still"
2214820,2220500," then it says no such file panger c when obviously this is not true here is the"
2220500,2228740," it's a panger 3d oh i figured it out guys i figured out how to use my own build system hell yeah"
2228740,2234820," brother hell yeah so yeah we should probably rewrite it and no by the way we're still using"
2234820,2242900," old no builds actually uh we're still using old no builds i i probably need to modernize it and also make"
2242900,2249060," the command line arguments more ergonomic so it's called no build for a reason"
2249060,2251540," no blocks"
2251540,2258980," god damn it so yeah we're having the situation of like a legacy mode and on legacy mode and it's like"
2258980,2267460," ah bravo bravo bravo bravo no build is a philosophy if somebody asks what is no build no build is not"
2267460,2275940," really as anything specific it's a philosophy uh which is very much applicable to cc plus plus code because"
2275940,2284500," cc plus plus code bases are kind of infected with a very dangerous and destructive mind virus of build"
2284500,2294340," systems people in cc plus plus community believe strongly believe that they must build more and more"
2294980,2300740," uh build systems that generate building scripts that generate building scripts that generate building"
2300740,2306100," scripts that generate building scripts that generate building scripts and all of that is somehow freaking"
2306100,2312900," justified in each chain in building script generation is a completely separate language"
2312900,2319060," and there is this like a tower of building script generators on top of building script generators on top of"
2319060,2327540," building script generators on top of building script generators that it's eventually gonna start falling over"
2327540,2329460," bruh"
2329460,2338820," like what's funny is that all of these freaking different languages for different build systems are"
2339620,2348900," basically turing complete languages essentially they're basically turing complete languages and you as a cc plus"
2348900,2357460," plus programmer have already have a very powerful turing complete language which is called c"
2357460,2366580," yet you feel the need to have another one for the sake of some sort of a perceived convenience because"
2366580,2374580," somebody on the hacker news told you so or whatever the fuck it is right so i think if you have a language"
2374580,2383460," and one language and you have a project written in in that language the only thing you must have to build"
2383460,2388900," that project in that language is the only the compiler of that language"
2389940,2396420," would it be cool if you had a c project and literally the only thing you needed to build that c project is"
2396420,2404740," just a c compiler a c compiler did the entirety of the job no c make no make no ninja no auto make"
2404740,2410020," auto conf right auto your mom or whatever the fuck it is like it's just a c compiler just a single"
2410020,2414820," fucking c compiler and like you can build the entirety of the big project in this entire thing"
2416260,2422900," the idea of the idea of no build it's it's not anything in specific it's a again it's an idea"
2422900,2425540," is that you're writing your build script and see"
2425540,2435300," you're writing your build script and see and essentially what you do uh you have several stages"
2435300,2442340," of building the project the first stage of building the project is going to be bootstrapping no build"
2442340,2446900," program right literally the only thing you need to do the only thing you need to do is just say okay"
2446900,2452980," i have a no build dot c in here if you open it it has a bunch of things it has a lot of things in here"
2452980,2461060," right it does a bunch of things okay but i as a c programmer do one single thing in here i just do cco"
2461060,2468980," no build no build dot c as simple as that nothing more nothing less anybody who wrote at least hello"
2468980,2475860," world in c can do this kind of just bootstrap the build system the building it's written in c"
2475860,2483220," then you just run it and it builds everything else for you and it does that by also using c compiler so"
2483220,2490660," essentially you write a build system for your project in c and it has several phases you bootstrap the first"
2490660,2496580," phase and that phase builds maybe more additional tools maybe more additional uh phases and just calls them"
2496580,2502900," and calls them and this entire thing sort of like just builds itself by only using a single c compiler"
2502900,2508980," no cmake no automake no additional languages like python no even bash you don't need any of that"
2508980,2515380," shit you already have a very powerful language that can build your entire project why the do you need to"
2515380,2520980," invent more and more and more languages i'm telling you this is some sort of a mind virus"
2521540,2527940," it's infecting people's brain i have no idea why the it does that you already have"
2527940,2536820," everything people stop get some help so that's basically an idea an idea is to have some sort of"
2536820,2544340," like a small library that implements basic building blocks for you like for example run an external shell"
2544340,2551540," command so then you can just like use c as a basic as a shell or something and since c is a proper turing"
2551540,2559220," complete language you can do very complex logic in this language way more complex than in cmake"
2559220,2565220," and it's going to be way more convenient than in cmake because cmake is a pretty shitty language"
2565220,2572500," honestly i wrote complicated stuff in cmake right so one of the things i had to had to do as of recently"
2572500,2580340," right so in c3 by the way in c3 there is this feature where you do c3 version right and it actually"
2580340,2593140," prints you git hash bruh c3 uses cmake baking git hash using cmake is a fucking barely solved computer science"
2593140,2603780," problem like holy fucking shit it's fucking insane how hard how unreasonably hard to just bake git hash in"
2603780,2610740," a reliable manner so it invalidates and reruns the necessary targets at the right time and it doesn't"
2610740,2617140," rerun it too often so it's too annoying or anything it's goddamn fucking insane it could have been just a"
2617140,2627540," a single condition in c in c but why have we have to deal with this shit uh so it's so fucking dumb it's insane"
2627540,2635540," uh and we brought all of that shit upon ourselves um so anyway um yeah"
2637780,2645380," let's address some subs uh so thank you so much let dance uh let in leading it thank you so much for"
2645380,2650180," which prime zorkin hammer holy shit i haven't seen you in the value thank you so much for"
2650180,2655460," 70 months uh of tier one subscription with the message but what if i want to make a new language"
2655460,2661540," to compile my program that does work half the time well i mean you your program"
2663380,2669460," like you can do whatever you want in your program right so it's just like uh i probably not going to"
2669460,2677860," be contributing to it so the thing is uh when when i talk about certain sort of like ways of developing"
2677860,2686580," things uh this is the things that i primarily going to be using um for for myself when i'm advocating this"
2686580,2692740," kind of thing i do realize that people who already use cmake and all these build generators they're"
2692740,2699300," probably not gonna like one day switch to this kind of approach not only because they are deep down"
2699300,2704740," ideologically into this sort of idea of building towers or obstructions right but also because it's"
2704740,2710500," sometimes technically impossible right because you already have a huge project that is business critical"
2710500,2717300," and touching anything in that project is basically setting yourself up for a failure uh right so and"
2717300,2725620," and this is why for example in c3 um i didn't push any of my ideas on c3 i just sat down and implemented"
2725620,2732260," whatever the i needed in cmake because it's not my project what i'm saying is that um when i'm advocating"
2732260,2739140," my ideas i'm just saying that this is the world i personally would like to live in right so but i do"
2739140,2744580," realize that not everybody is going to accept that right uh so this is something that i'm going to use"
2744580,2751460," in my projects and if you want to do something else in your project fine right so that's that's fine for"
2751460,2756580," me right i'm just saying i'm just pointing out the certain inconveniences right so i'm just saying that"
2756580,2762100," maybe world would have been better if people stopped doing this kind of thing but i do realize also"
2762100,2768180," that we're living in the real world and like real world is not perfect and we kind of have to live with"
2768180,2775220," all that yeah so again so people think that i'm very much like ideological person that like everything"
2775220,2780100," is just like has to be like that like that like that but at the same time i just sat down and spent"
2780100,2789620," several hours implementing this thing in cmake right so yeah even though i'm constantly talking about some"
2789620,2796900," ideal world out there i'm also actually very much like a grounded person grounded to reality and if i"
2796900,2805140," need to do something in reality i just sit down and do that right so yeah but here's my stream here's my"
2805140,2811700," world so and i'm just like talking about like fantasizing about you know how world would have been"
2811700,2818020," better if it would have been better if it was like that so and maybe these ideas will resonate with some"
2818020,2825300," people and the world will become better just hoping but again not forcing that on anybody"
2826740,2834100," so yes we're already streaming for one hour so i think the time has come to make a small break"
2834100,2842660," and maybe even brew a cup of tea so let's go all right we are back and uh one of the things i want"
2842660,2852340," you to do by the way um i want you to do an analysis of the components of the mesh of the of the model"
2852340,2857540," right so here's an interesting thing um so as i already said at the beginning of the stream somebody"
2857540,2866100," warned me that there is an outer shell uh on the on the model which may if not handled correctly prevent"
2866100,2874020," us from seeing the texture of panger right so it should be probably sort of like semi-transparent"
2874020,2879220," or something like that so it's there to give it sort of cartoonish look uh right and we're probably"
2879220,2884900," not going to be doing whatever you know the usual you know software renderers are doing not really"
2884900,2889460," software in this but you usual renderers are doing like a blender or maybe some engines and stuff like"
2889460,2893220," that we're definitely not going to be doing that and one of the things i want you to do i want you to"
2893780,2901860," strip off that outer shell preferably uh programmatically so and how can we do that"
2901860,2907620," because we don't really have like a shell as a separate component uh what we have is just all of"
2907620,2914180," the vertices then all of the faces and like where is the outer shell how do i remove such outer shell"
2914180,2921220," and there is a thousands of the faces and thousands of the vertices um so what i was thinking is that maybe"
2921220,2929380," maybe i don't know that for sure but maybe outer shell is actually um a separate isolated component"
2929380,2938820," on the mesh right so essentially you can think of the mesh as sort of a graph right i'm pretty sure it's"
2938820,2947140," a graph uh so and you have vertices and versus are connected into faces uh which are triangles essentially"
2948180,2952260," uh so you have a bunch of vertices or maybe i want to actually make it a little bit brighter so it's"
2952260,2958500," visible more on that stuff so we have a bunch of vertices uh like so uh right and they are connected"
2958500,2967460," into triangles like so uh right so this is a fully connected sort of component of the mesh"
2968580,2973860," then who said that in blender you can't make something like this where you have another fully"
2973860,2979620," connected component of the mesh like so right so fully connected component of the mesh"
2979620,2985220," but it's not connected to this component right so it's not connected to this one it's just like"
2985220,2992980," a mesh consisted of two separate components right so and my hypothesis is that maybe shell is just like a"
2992980,2999700," completely separate components so and if it's completely separate and not connected to anything else"
2999700,3004020," maybe we can identify it programmatically and strip it off"
3004020,3010020," maybe right so how can we do that we can just do bfs honestly"
3014100,3020660," what if the mesh isn't triangulated what do you mean it's not triangulated we literally have a sequence"
3020660,3026500," of faces which are triples of vertices in did you just join this stream did you just join the stream"
3026500,3029940," and just said whatever the first thing come to your mind after you hear this thing without"
3029940,3039620," understanding what the we're doing mods who didn't put submod on like freaking all right whatever um so"
3042180,3046740," bad bots"
3046740,3053300," anyways so and one of the things i want to try right so i want to try to do bfs on them"
3053300,3057060," right i want to try to do bfs and if you never heard about bfs google it up it's actually"
3057060,3062340," pretty cool algorithm and i recommend you to learn about it uh right so bfs so we can"
3062340,3068900," so let's find it out uh let's find it out let's find it out"
3072180,3077140," oh you mean by triangulated that means you they are shared or something like that"
3077140,3082820," they're not shared properly that's what you probably mean okay mods on ban i think i think i"
3082820,3088500," understand what they meant uh right but we're gonna try anyway so let's stop talking ourselves"
3088500,3095220," away from doing things for fuck's sake uh right so yeah so this is the algorithm that basically"
3095220,3103300," sends a wave uh on a graph on a sub graph right it sends some sort of a wave right you start from a"
3103300,3110500," particular uh vertex and then from that vertex you send a wave to that vertex and that vertex and you"
3110500,3118020," kind of have a list where you maintain uh the list of the wave right so essentially currently right now"
3118020,3123620," our wave consists of two or three then okay i'm iterating through this entire wave and i'm looking at the"
3123620,3131060," nearest vertices that i didn't visit okay so i go here to four uh three already visited so i don't go there"
3131060,3136740," right so the next wave is going to be four and in three in here it's only five right so this is the next wave"
3136740,3142260," and uh from this next wave i see that i visited everything and i stopped the algorithm and since"
3142260,3151300," i was marking the vertices uh that i visited i know exactly the the component the isolated component and"
3151300,3156660," i know that everything else is not part of that component so that's basically the bfs algorithm"
3156660,3163300," essentially right so i mean there's um you can also use dfs in here right but bfs and dfs is just"
3163300,3169540," difference in in in the order that you are uh you know traversing the vertices in so i wanted to try to"
3169540,3174980," implement this kind of thing and just um maybe analyze the amount of components we have in the mesh"
3174980,3183940," right just right just to see if we can identify the outer shell and if we can identify the outer shell"
3183940,3189940," uh we can programmatically strip it off right so the idea is going to be maybe our obg to c tool on"
3189940,3196100," top of just parsing everything it's also going to be traversing the mesh uh right and telling you how"
3196100,3204260," many components it found right so how many components it found um and uh right after and basically maybe"
3204260,3210420," give you the list of components okay so this mesh has these components and then it will give you an option"
3210420,3216340," okay you you can strip off the fifth component right and we strip off the fifth component and we'll then"
3216340,3222740," look at the rendered uh at the rendered mesh and maybe we'll be able to strip off the outer shell"
3222740,3227380," like that or maybe not i don't know that's kind of the point of this experiment that i want to conduct"
3227380,3233940," i don't know right so and the way i can learn about that is by just trying to do that and i think it's kind"
3233940,3238740," of fun right so i haven't implemented bfs in quite some time uh so i think it's going to be pretty cool"
3238740,3243220," exercise even if it doesn't work out right because i don't know if it's going to work out but if it"
3243220,3245460," doesn't work out i think it's still going to be pretty cool exercise"
3245460,3250260," so yeah sounds good sounds gucci"
3250260,3257140," that's good uh anyway so let me close this entire shise and let's see what we can do about"
3257140,3265220," that we can do about that we can do about it so the way we're going to be actually traversing this"
3265220,3278100," entire stuff so um i think we may want to start with a certain vertex and then we need to be able what"
3278100,3286820," are the neighboring vertices for that vertex given the faces and stuff like that and yeah um interestingly"
3286820,3294660," we maybe we can have some sort of association right so you can take a look at the vertex and then you can"
3294660,3303060," see what face that vertex belongs to like all the list of faces that specific vertex belongs to"
3303060,3310420," right so you can try to see that uh right and um so when you start traversing you look at the vertex"
3310420,3316420," you extract the faces this vertex belongs to you iterate for all of the faces and you just like"
3316420,3322100," visit each individual other vertex that is not visited yet all right and that's how we can be"
3322100,3329700," traversing this entire thing and we can quite easily actually um give that information as we parse the faces"
3329700,3336260," right so as a part of the faces as you can see we extract the vertices we can then go find that"
3336260,3342980," vertex in the array of vertices and just add the current face uh the current face index into that"
3342980,3349140," so the vertex list somewhere so we'll need to uh for each vertex we'll need to associate the list of"
3349140,3355940," face indices right so that's what we'll have to do how do we parse uh uh vertices okay so we have a"
3355940,3362980," vertices array it's a dynamic array in here uh and it's just a yeah it's an array of vertices as you can see"
3362980,3373060," so let's actually find uh okay so that's pretty cool um and it's basically a vector 3d right so the vector 3d"
3373060,3386500," is just is just this okay uh so maybe we can actually introduce something like um you know vertex"
3386500,3391300," all right uh something like a vertex"
3391300,3401540," and it's going to have a position right so this is the position of the vertex and list of faces um right so"
3401540,3407540," list of faces like maybe it has to be something like faces we already have a faces and this is the"
3407540,3414900," thing but we need to have um you know indices in here right so it has to be has to be indices so maybe"
3414900,3426100," face uh faces indices right so face indices right so this is going to be the faces so and the vertices"
3426100,3432580," actually is going to be a vertex it's a dynamic array vertices is a dynamic array of vertices and face"
3432580,3441300," indices face indices is actually a dynamic array of indices uh so maybe it's going to be something like"
3441300,3447140," this so it's going to be items like so and it's going to have capacity and the count and so on and so"
3447140,3454900," first so each individual vertex has sort of this thing associated with it uh how many max faces can the"
3454900,3456580," vertex have i don't know"
3456580,3464820," and that's why we're making it a dynamic array look at that look at that it's a dynamic array so it has"
3464820,3472500," additional information like capacity count so then our di append uh macro can extend as much as it wants"
3473220,3478900," right so we're like we don't know up front how many faces it could be part of uh and doesn't really"
3478900,3485620," matter right so because uh we we store that in a dynamic array anyway um okay so since i changed the"
3485620,3492820," definition of the vertices so that means all the code that is uh working with vertices is going to break"
3492820,3500180," so we're gonna do a compiler assisted refactoring so no build uh so let's say tools we're building the tools"
3501220,3508020," so what we have in here so it's a struct of course thank you very much uh i do in fact no c okay this"
3508020,3514340," one is interesting so as you can see here we are iterating through this thing so this is the position"
3514340,3519780," right so i just have to do the position it's very easy to fix uh and when i'm pushing okay so this is"
3519780,3526660," very cool maybe i should introduce something like a make vertex right so make vertex uh and it will"
3526660,3536340," automatically like create a vertex with empty faces uh all right so make vector three right so this is"
3536340,3543460," make vector three uh and where is the make vertex right so this thing is going to return the vertex"
3543460,3549300," it is going to accept the xyz because that's what we need to have in here to create this thing"
3550580,3556340," right so this is right so this is xyz uh vertex uh like this v"
3556340,3569620," so the position is going to be make vector three xyz and i suppose faces i just wanna can you just do"
3569620,3573700," something like this i think i should be able to just do something like this because when you use this"
3574740,3581140," uh syntax it automatically cleans out the rest of this thing so the face is going to be cleaned up"
3581140,3588500," uh right so might as well maybe even just return you know the collateral style kind of thing"
3588500,3597380," okay that's fine i suppose uh let's go here let's go here what do we have uh where is the compilation"
3597380,3603060," okay that's cool so what do we have in here i'm iterating through the vertices and i remap object"
3603060,3613220," oh this is so freaking cool we'll do some sort of a remapping after holy"
3613220,3616820," shit so we're normalizing this thing i suppose"
3618580,3626820," yeah oh what the i didn't know this thing does that so essentially it does that to ensure that the"
3626820,3632100," object when it's like rendered it's always centered i i don't remember doing that this is so cool"
3632100,3639380," holy right so it basically analyzes the ranges of x y and z right so just like analyzes and just like"
3639380,3643860," makes it fit into like one by one by one and because of that it stretches that stuff but at least it"
3643860,3650660," ensures that it's uh within the um within the view right so that's why panger is a little bit scuffed"
3650660,3655940," maybe i should actually preserve the ratios and stuff like that that would be actually kind of nice"
3655940,3664980," maybe i'm gonna put it to do in here all right so do uh rescale uh maybe remap uh um with preserved"
3665540,3675220," ratios uh of the uh of the object right so because if we take a look at how panger looks like at the"
3675220,3680580," at the bottom there it's kind of like scuffed a little bit right it's it's too stretched because it"
3680580,3686580," made we made it fit into one by one by one the code seems to preserve ratio really doesn't preserve ratios i"
3686580,3698740," don't think so uh no that's it ah it okay okay i say so i'm an idiot i thought it normalizes for a"
3698740,3705060," second i thought it normalizes yeah yeah so it's preserved i'm sorry like okay i wasn't working with"
3705060,3709620," this code for quite some time right i don't remember everything it does but yeah but i thought it's a"
3709620,3717460," normalization of some sort okay so preserve everything nice to see that nice to see uh but"
3717460,3725860," anyway anyway whatever all right so we do in here uh so this is the items and what we're gonna do we"
3725860,3732660," want to just do the position in here okay so the rest of the things uh remapping and we are remapping"
3732660,3741860," the position as well all right so yeah everything seems to be working and let's actually see if uh if"
3741860,3753940," i do assets um everything seems to be fine that's cool now no no no no no no no no no no no um so the"
3753940,3766020," face we have in here is rather interesting right so the actual index of the face is going to be"
3766020,3774180," the size of the faces right so we can say face index right so this is a face index and this is basically"
3774180,3782980," the count right so that's what it is it's a it's this stuff uh and as we parse each individual vertex"
3782980,3788020," right as we parse each individual vertex can we assume that we already"
3788020,3790420," oof"
3790420,3795380," so that kind of implies"
3795380,3806740," this is hard man because um what if it's referring to some vertices that are not there yet"
3807780,3813940," they're not there yet damn bruv damn damn damn damn"
3813940,3820420," so that actually depends on first on vertices coming first"
3820420,3831780," and then on faces coming next uh unless we kind of iterated the entire thing several times focusing only on"
3831780,3837700," vertices or focusing only on faces and stuff like that does anybody remember uh according to the standard is"
3837780,3848260," there any like order so restrictions constraints that like vertices have to come first or is it like you can actually mishmash them as well as like however you want"
3848260,3853140," i don't really know so uh obg format wiki"
3853140,3859620," right if you can mishmash them so we have to rewrite the whole thing but not really rewrite but at least restructure it"
3860260,3864260," i don't think there is an order okay that sucks a little bit"
3864260,3872260," that is sucky wacky a tiny bit uh an object might contain vertex data blah blah blah connectivity between"
3872820,3874580," freeform the most common uh"
3874580,3875220," uh"
3875220,3875700," object"
3875700,3879300," geometric vertices okay"
3879300,3881860," so ctrl f order"
3881860,3884900," okay so the clockwise order"
3884900,3893620," okay recording letter specify the order of the vertices which build the polyline okay"
3893620,3900260," yeah i didn't see anything i think there's a counter uh counter example in the models you have"
3900740,3902900," you think let's let's take a look at that"
3902900,3913460," uh let's take a look at some obgs uh all right so here's the utility parts of vertices then faces okay"
3913460,3927220," so then a low poly vertices then faces so uh maybe since i don't really have any object as of right now"
3928740,3930740," that"
3930740,3932740," doesn't use like out of other things"
3932740,3938180," maybe i'm going to just assume that vertices always come first and faces always come next"
3938180,3944100," right so and put it to do in there saying that this is what we kind of assume"
3944100,3950580," uh right so if something if we have a counter example to that like we'll have to restructure the code"
3950580,3954580," but restructuring the code should be that difficult so essentially instead of"
3955220,3963060," um a single loop with separate cases as we as we have in here uh for each case we can create a separate"
3963060,3968980," loop right so for example first loop we're only looking at the vertices we're only parsing the"
3968980,3975060," strings that start with v ignoring everything else right one iteration okay collected all of the vertices"
3975620,3982100," next iteration collecting all of the vts right collected all the vts and then collected all the faces and"
3982100,3991540," we can do that in whatever order we want right uh so why not load everything first then do the bfs"
3995620,4004340," so um yeah if we ever need uh the um like to restructure this entire thing uh it's really easy"
4004340,4009940," to do but right now uh we don't have any examples where it's really needed so i think it's it's totally"
4009940,4023380," fine okay so uh let me let me see to do uh maybe um note let's put a note in here um this code this code"
4023380,4033300," it's actually kind of related to faces um all right so let's put it like this this code assumes that uh we"
4033300,4047620," already parsed all of the faces uh but uh i couldn't find anything on wikipedia uh"
4047620,4062980," regarding obg files um um um regarding the order of the what are they called directives how do"
4062980,4070020," they call these things are they called directives or the reference materials uh so what is the"
4070020,4077620," collective elements okay i think it's a good name regarding the order of the elements of the obg files"
4077620,4082740," uh right but i couldn't find anything on wikipedia regarding the order of the elements of the obg file"
4082740,4090740," uh i should probably read the specs but i'm too lazy for that right i'm too lazy for that"
4092660,4108420," uh right but since we don't have any obg files in the in the assets that have faces before vertices"
4108420,4113620," it does not really matter that much"
4115940,4125700," if we ever have any of such obg files it's easy to restructure"
4125700,4139780," structure this loop to support any order of the elements of the elements so remember that the vertices"
4140580,4147940," that for the vertices the um uh they can be interspurbed through the file only the order they appear"
4147940,4154980," makes the difference oh okay so that that makes sense uh okay so this is the official thank you thank"
4154980,4162260," you so much uh thank you thank you thank you obg format i should probably maybe save"
4164180,4182820," an obg file for me okay so they could have said that we already uh parsed all of the all of the"
4182820,4189220," vertices but since we don't have any obg files in the data set you know this kind of sounds weird"
4190260,4205940," um um since we don't have um since we don't have uh any obg files in the assets that have faces before"
4205940,4213060," it doesn't really matter that much uh if we uh if we ever have any of such obg files it's easy to"
4213060,4218020," restructure this loop to support any order of the elements okay so that's that's very cool again"
4218020,4226020," uh can i i can't really reformat it properly unfortunately my mode is too weak for that i'm"
4226020,4230100," using a custom c mode for this kind of thing so i have to kind of do it like this"
4230100,4236500," all right so uh this is basically the assumption we have in here and uh maybe i'm going to actually"
4236500,4244660," turn it into to do uh right so basically restructure this entire thing to kind of like support any order"
4244660,4254420," or whatever uh so yeah let me let me see so how we're going to be doing all of that so we're going"
4254420,4263860," to take the vertices uh so this is going to be v1 um so it's an index and it's not even um you know"
4263860,4273700," adjusted for yeah so we're not we're adjusting this index like here uh only here but i suppose we have"
4273700,4283700," to do that up front uh wall fix w thank you so much for twitch prime thank you so uh maybe we should"
4283700,4291380," do that like as we parse things it's kind of stupid right so let's actually not do that in here let's"
4291380,4302100," do that where we parse all of that so uh might as well you know what i might as well just do that in here"
4302100,4315780," all right so note uh minus one is to account for one based in the scene in this in uh is to account"
4315780,4326100," for one based in the scene uh all right so we probably will have to do that for the vts and vns and"
4326100,4331460," stuff like that as well at some point but it doesn't really matter that much doesn't really matter that"
4331460,4340580," much so yeah so now everything is um properly parsed and everything so that means we can do vertices"
4340580,4350180," items v1 and here's the faces and we have to do di append uh di append on each individual of them"
4350180,4360580," by using face index like so so this is going to be v2 and this is going to be v3 all right uh so yeah that's"
4360580,4369620," pretty much it so for each individual face we say okay so uh that vertex appears in these faces right"
4369620,4375860," so that vertex appears in those faces and so on and so forth all right so we can try to do uh we can try"
4375860,4381940," to build this entire thing now right so it's going to be tools uh right everything built no no problem"
4381940,4388420," whatsoever um when i'm actually rebuilding the assets when i'm rebuilding the assets like i put a little bit of a"
4388420,4394660," statistics in here about the mesh that we parsed right so how many vertices we have how many normals"
4394660,4402100," and so on and so forth how many faces and one of the things oh this one is weird that's not that many faces"
4404740,4408820," so this is obgt pot is it that small"
4408820,4420980," wait a freaking second something is sus in here something is absolutely sus so there's no normals no"
4420980,4429460," textures i remember having more of these things or didn't i or i think it's it's okay so let me actually"
4430740,4437220," stash everything i have uh right because it's kind of sus so we're building this thing"
4437220,4445140," and then assets okay so it was like that before right i suppose like x i remember vaguely that it"
4445140,4449940," was like around several thousands but i think i remember it from the teapot right it's teapot that"
4449940,4455140," has uh several thousands of vertices and faces and stuff like that okay so that's that's basically the case"
4455140,4461300," in here all right so i'm trying to be a little bit careful in here okay so let's try to have a little"
4461300,4468260," bit of a stats in here uh let's try to have a little bit of a stats the stats that i want to have is minimum"
4468260,4475860," and maximum amount of faces each individual vertex can be in right so that's the that's the information i'm"
4475860,4487860," interested in so how can we do that so uh mean mean faces right so mean faces and max faces um"
4487860,4493780," so mean and max so here we have flt so this is the int mean int man okay so maybe i can just use"
4493780,4499220," int in here all right so it's going to be int and here we're going to have have int max and here is"
4499220,4504340," int min so for each individual vertex we're going to be iterating all the vertices uh we're going to just"
4504340,4510260," look at the amount of faces that vertex belongs to right and just like use mean and max and stuff like"
4510260,4517940," that okay let's iterate so iterate through the vertices uh so this is the count right so i'm iterating"
4517940,4530660," through all of them and if mean faces is greater than vertices items i faces count then this is the new minimum"
4531540,4538740," this is the new minimum of the vertices that we're dealing with right and the max let's query replace"
4538740,4546740," mean with max boom it's the same but the opposite so that's it essentially that's it uh so there's a"
4546740,4551460," little bit of a duplication in here so which is kind of annoying syntactically it's kind of noisy we could"
4551460,4557220," replace it with just count uh right so and just like assign it somewhere here so something like that and"
4557220,4567540," you know you just precast it to integer um so it's not count it's count so c out it's like from c plus plus"
4567540,4576340," uh there we go so that's syntactically less annoying to read and we can um we can now print that information"
4576340,4586820," somehow so we can say so faces per vertex right not sure how descriptive this thing is uh but we can try to"
4586820,4600740," do it like this okay so uh so mean and max mean faces max faces right so uh let's see if this entire thing"
4600740,4609060," even compiles so this is tools uh there we go and this is assets all right so we have some this is"
4609060,4614980," very interesting look at that so let's take a look at some of the uh apple like i forgot the new line"
4614980,4624820," cat freaking damn it forgot the new line all right one more time uh so this is going to be the tools uh this is"
4624820,4631860," the tools and then assets there we go so let's take a look at some of these things low polycap uh some of"
4631860,4642820," the um vertices have nine faces they appear in nine faces for the c yuta teapot one vertex max appears"
4642820,4648340," like 40 times so it's a part of d40 different faces"
4651140,4657460," so this is kind of cool right and for the uh for the penguin for the panger it's from four to eight"
4657460,4663540," probably the tip yeah it's probably yeah it's it's the tip of the of the cap uh last miles hello hello"
4663540,4669060," uh right so it's a tip of the cap there is a lot of things like that in there uh but at least we we have"
4669060,4676500," this information now right so at least we have this information and uh we can do a bfs right so we can now"
4676500,4682980," count the amount of components uh right so which is rather cool i think um so at least count them right"
4682980,4690900," so at least counting them is going to be a rather rather useful we now can even extend the definition"
4690900,4696020," of the vertex right so the definition of the vertex and we can say whether that vertex is visited or not"
4696820,4703460," right so visited so as we do the bfs uh we're going to be looking at this in desktop"
4703460,4710980," and seeing okay did we visit that vertex did we not visit that vertex and that should be interesting"
4710980,4716420," at least count not identify certain um certain components but just like count them"
4716420,4723060," and i think it's going to be rather interesting uh so let me now try the following thing so this"
4723060,4730180," is going to be assets and uh i'm going to do the tools and i want to rebuild the um the demos right"
4730180,4738420," so let's actually rebuild all the demos uh yes yes yes so let me release the plebs uh and let's take a"
4738420,4749220," look at the demos so so i just want to make sure that no models no matches are screwed up by our experiments"
4749220,4755460," and stuff like that uh i just want to see that uh and after we see that uh we can try to do the bfs and"
4755460,4758980," at least count the uh the amount of components"
4758980,4767540," we're kind of fun if the amount of components on you the teapot is going to be like four right the spout"
4767540,4775780," the handle the main body the vessel and the the cap right so it's gonna be kind of actually kind of cool"
4775780,4786820," i think um but anyway so what do we have so i need to go to here so this is the assets and let's take a"
4786820,4794580," look at the local host all right so all the demos seems to be fine nothing is broken nothing is actually"
4794580,4803460," broken so far uh which is really cool which is really cool okay all right so how can we do the bfs"
4803460,4810820," how can we do the bfs um so we need to have a key to do a bfs we need to have some sort of a queue"
4811540,4823220," um right so we have already face indices um so maybe we can have like a vertex"
4823220,4831620," vertex synthesis why not so it's kind of the same thing but it's just like uh right semantically"
4831620,4839780," different it's semantically different uh okay so i probably want to do bfs before printing the stats"
4839780,4846980," right so because it's going to be part of the stats uh so here what we're going to do we're going to"
4846980,4854660," have vertex indices right so this is the current wave that we're having so this is the current wave"
4854660,4862340," and um we're going to be on each iteration we're going to we're going to be computing the next wave"
4862340,4869460," sort of speak so to compute the next wave what we need to do we need to identify whether we have"
4869460,4876100," any unvisited vertices right so we need to find an unvisited vertex like how can we do that it's"
4876100,4880420," actually pretty easy operation right so it's going to be something like this i'm going to be iterating"
4880420,4894100," the vertices uh plus plus i and uh if uh vertices i times i not visited right not visited i is the vertex"
4894100,4902580," that we want to work with right so it would be probably better to put that into a separate"
4903300,4912660," separate function so to speak uh unvisited vertex like so so this is an unvisited vertex"
4912660,4919140," and here we're going to be passing maybe just vertices right so vertices vertices we can pass it"
4919140,4925860," by value because the vertices structure itself is actually kind of lightweight right so it's only 364"
4925860,4933140," bit numbers it's actually a 364 bit numbers because uh the the actual data is stored in a heap so and in"
4933140,4938820," here right so we just um find the index and we return the index if we couldn't find it we probably want"
4938820,4949140," to return like minus one um right so now if i go back in here so here's the wave uh and then we just"
4950500,4960500," trying to find the start and visited vertex vertices right and essentially while start is greater or"
4960500,4967860," equal to zero we're just going to be doing the bfs right so we're going to be just doing bfs um so"
4967860,4975620," because we're going to be doing several bfs's right several of them um we can have the amount of"
4975620,4986180," components uh comp count equal to zero in here so and then if we manage to go into that loop if we have"
4986180,4992900," a single unvisited vertex that means uh we have at least one component so this is the start of the new"
4992900,4998660," component in here right so this is the start of the new component we are going to be you know counting it"
4999300,5006580," so this is something that we probably want to put in here uh amount of components uh all right"
5006580,5018660," so comp count maybe components count yeah there we go so this is a comp count new line uh so and in here"
5018660,5026500," since we're starting i probably should push the start in here so do i append uh at the start"
5029300,5040500," so we're doing the start and while wave count is greater than zero right while we have something"
5040500,5048100," in the wave we need to compute the next wave right so we'll we'll iterating through the elements of the"
5048100,5054340," current wave looking at their neighbors and if we didn't visit those neighbors yet we're going to be"
5054340,5059140," marking them as visited and we're going to be adding them to the new wave in fact we can just reuse the"
5059140,5068100," same um the same thing in here right so we can reuse the same cueing oh this one is a little bit nasty"
5068100,5077780," because yeah it needs to be q so if we want to be using this single sort of data structure uh it's better to"
5077780,5084340," just push at the end and pop out from the beginning but if we don't have a queue we need at least two"
5084340,5094740," arrays in here uh two arrays in here so if it's greatest so we'll have to be computing uh next wave"
5094740,5099780," right so this is the next wave and we're going to be iterating through elements of the old wave"
5100660,5108260," right so these are the elements of the old wave and honestly we'll have to be switching between them so"
5108260,5121060," so to not lose any memory and everything so uh wave count plus plus i right so and if"
5123220,5134420," wave items wave items right then we take a look at the vertices so vertices items yeah so it contains"
5134420,5144180," the index of the vertex and if the neighbor is not visited right it's not visited that's the thing that"
5144180,5152340," should go into the uh into the next stuff um all right"
5152340,5164900," so yeah that's very interesting so this is the we should actually get that as a vertex right so this"
5164900,5171460," is going to be a vertex um i don't plan to modify it and well i mean i do plan to modify it so this is going"
5171460,5180100," to be this one so this is sort of the current vertex so this is the pointer and uh we need to look at its"
5180100,5192020," neighbors right so uh it's going to be size j j less than vertex faces count right so this is the faces count"
5192020,5199940," and for each face right once we find that face we have to iterate the um"
5201860,5206900," each individual vertex of that face and if it's not visited added to the visited and stuff like that"
5206900,5214340," and another important thing i forgot in here is that uh we need to mark that vertex as visited so"
5214340,5222740," so since this thing is not visited right so we need to go to vertices items start uh visited true right so"
5222740,5227860," this is sort of the first thing that is visited so here's the current wave we add start to the current"
5227860,5233060," wave and we say that it is visited so we don't add ourselves to this and that thing uh aqua here thank"
5233060,5237140," you so much for tier one with the message uh panger your mom bangor"
5237140,5239460," yes"
5239460,5250340," oh yeah your mom banger that's true that is actually true uh anyways so here's the face but the problem here is"
5250340,5258260," that we can't iterate face uh vertices of the faces because look at the definition of the face look at"
5258260,5264020," the definition of the face where is it where is it it's just these things which means that"
5264020,5271860," we probably want to uh make this thing an array because we want to be able to iterate this entire"
5271860,5276660," thing and that means that all of these things should also become arrays and stuff like that that"
5276660,5281860," prompts a little bit of a uh compiler assisted refactoring uh and i'm not sure if i want to go"
5281860,5286660," into that right now but i mean that sounds like a fun idea so you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna"
5286660,5296260," actually comment out sort of this thing uh this unfinished bfs for now right and i'm gonna try to"
5296260,5303060," refactor faces to to be arrays right because that's what we want in here uh so it would be actually kind"
5303060,5308900," of cool for this thing to be like actual arrays this thing i think i think i think that's a good idea"
5308900,5315060," yeah uh so my mouse is dead almost dead almost dead"
5315060,5323700," so let's go ahead and just go to the compilation area so it's gonna be tools so in how many places"
5323700,5330020," this mother flipper is going to break uh so this is a count okay so this is a code that should have"
5330020,5339300," been commented out but i mean wait did i not change this thing yeah all right let's get started so this"
5339300,5347300," is going to be three uh this is going to be three uh and this is also going to be three uh this is also"
5347300,5355620," going to be three i guess still arguing about this kind of what is this what is this botting what are"
5355620,5370100," these bots i mean i swear to god this is some sort of a bots"
5370100,5382260," uh so i wonder if this is going to work this is a very interesting question can i just do something yeah"
5382260,5394580," that looks epic"
5394580,5401380," so"
5401380,5405780," okay so what do we have in here"
5406820,5415300," ah i forgot that comma what else we're almost there we're almost there all right so that's"
5415300,5420500," actually very easy well look how easy this syntactically to refactor these things into a race"
5420500,5424180," they were already but but they are zero based"
5424180,5425620," fuck"
5425620,5431700," uh so this is dangerous brother this is dangerous broski"
5432820,5441460," fork uh broski broski broski we need to find all of these like v3 okay so this is the only"
5441460,5450900," easy refactor yeah good for condemn it mate good for condemn it it's actually it was actually all"
5450900,5460660," what was it already that so"
5460660,5467460," yeah that's that's fine that's fine okay"
5467460,5473060," yeah i could have just used the union that's true but i mean i already refactored it"
5474740,5489220," uh already refactored it's uh if there's nothing on the line 418 you're banned perma band"
5495860,5509860," i think you can do that i've been doing that for almost 10 years bro bro i've been streaming"
5509860,5515140," programming for almost 10 years you you think you can debate me like that you really think you can"
5515140,5516020," debate me like that"
5516020,5522340," easy anyways uh so"
5522340,5530260," now let me let me see so component counts component counts"
5530260,5539860," uh we everything seems to be fine so i want to try ran assets uh and let's actually rebuild all the"
5539860,5555780," demos just in case"
5555780,5565460," uh chat only yeah i also think so"
5566260,5572980," um i think the time has come put chat on"
5572980,5589860," so uh let me let me see let me see let me see so everything seems to be working everything seems to"
5589860,5596900," be twerking everything seems to be working seems to be twerking"
5596900,5603380," all right so as you can see chat everything's fine nothing is broken i don't know why you're"
5603380,5613460," fuzzing about so let me let me see let me see uh so now we are actually have the thing"
5614660,5623300," where we can iterate through the rest of this stuff all right so we're iterating the faces right and then"
5623300,5629940," we're going to be uh iterating um through through all the vertices right so we can do something like"
5629940,5637220," uh this but it's kind of dangerous in a sense that what if we change the amount of vertices per face"
5638660,5642900," uh what if we change the amount of vertices per face so we need to have something like an array"
5642900,5648020," len um so and if this is the face"
5649460,5664340," um you know what uh so vertices per face per face this is probably what we want to have in here"
5664340,5674420," vertices per face uh vertices per face and there's going to be three of them so i just wanted i just"
5674420,5680980," wanted to be like a very obnoxious in case i want to change the amount of vertices per face i'm probably"
5680980,5686900," not going to be doing that but if i were to ever change the amount of vertices per face i want it"
5686900,5692340," to be as obnoxious as possible so i don't forget to modify some things or whatever you know what i'm"
5692340,5698820," talking about so and here i might as well do something like a static assert and just say that in"
5698820,5707060," here we kind of assume the amount of vertices per faces to be three right uh right so yeah something"
5707060,5714100," like that uh vertices per face please do don't modify yeah exactly exactly so uh like i don't know what"
5714100,5719700," to put in here so it's going to be just empty uh so and like i just don't want to have some sort"
5719700,5725540," of like weird magical constant in here right uh i just want to hear this thing to have like a meaningful"
5725540,5736180," name uh right okay finally so uh this is like a lot of nasty things so we iterate in the wave uh right"
5736180,5743540," so then we take in the vertex and then we have the faces that vertex belongs to and within that face"
5743540,5748500," we're iterating all of the elements of that face and we need to check whether they're visited or not"
5748500,5757780," so we need to check out so we need to do vertices uh items uh all right so this is like oh this one is"
5757780,5760340," rather interesting so this is the face"
5760340,5772900," so this is the faces so it's a items it's a j's face face we belong to and there is also"
5776260,5782580," but this is just an index that's what's interesting so that means it's items of the faces like that"
5782580,5785300," and then we just do k"
5785300,5796980," i hope i didn't fuck up anything in here so essentially we are um yeah we are doing like an index chasing"
5796980,5804980," right so we're doing like a index chasing so here is the current vertex in the in the wave"
5805940,5815060," we are taking jth face this vertex belongs to right and then we looking up that face and within that"
5815060,5824340," phase we we're taking case vertex and this is the neighbor index actually so this is the neighbor index"
5824340,5835860," um that's what it is um we can do something like a name neighbor index that's what it is"
5835940,5839300," and then within the vertices items and then within the vertices items"
5839300,5847300," neighbor index if it is not visited if it is not visited for whatever reason"
5847300,5854420," we need to add this thing to the next wave right we must add this thing to the next wave so it's going"
5854420,5863860," to be di append uh all right next wave add that neighbor index it's a little bit complicated but it's just like a"
5863860,5867780," complicated data structure right so it's kind of a complicated data structure so i don't know"
5867780,5880340," all right so here we processed the entire current wave and we constructed next wave that's what happened in"
5880340,5888260," here actually that's what happened in here and essentially what we want to do we kind of want to swap out"
5888980,5894180," current wave and the next wave if that makes any sense we want to swap them out"
5894180,5902980," um so i probably because of that i want to keep next wave somewhere here right i want to keep it somewhere"
5902980,5912020," here so after we processed the old wave we might as well clean it out so i'm going to set count to zero and"
5912020,5919060," and now we need to swap somehow the waves and i wonder if we can just use the regular swap algorithm"
5919060,5927780," right so this is just like a temporary wave then wave uh next wave and then next wave is going to be"
5927780,5932980," temporary so i just want to swap them out since vertex index is actually a very lightweight object"
5933860,5937700," it's not going to be very expensive operation because what we're doing we're swapping three"
5937700,5946820," 64-bit numbers right it's just dynamic rate uh right so this is basically what we're doing that's the bfs"
5948260,5957460," uh right and every time right so this is a single bfs we perform in here uh and at the end of a single bfs"
5957460,5968180," we have to repeat this entire operation one more time right so does that make any sense what we're doing"
5968180,5974900," in here we're counting the components we're starting by finding the first and visited vertex let's double check"
5975700,5980500," right so the first one that is unvisited there we go so it's greater than zero if we found the first"
5980500,5986900," and visited in a vertex that means we found one component already it makes sense to just like count it"
5986900,5993300," okay so now we allocate uh two data structures for maintaining the wave right so there is a current"
5993300,5999540," wave and the next wave which can be constantly swapped out so we're adding the found start vertex to"
5999540,6008180," the wave and marking it as visited right while uh while we have something within the wave we're"
6008180,6012580," processing the wave by processing the wave we mean we're competing the next wave we're iterating each"
6012580,6019380," individual vertex here's the current vertex we're iterating each individual face that vertex belongs to"
6019380,6027300," for each individual face that vertex belongs to we iterate each individual vertex of that face meaning"
6027300,6032500," that uh all of the neighbors and including that thing uh right so and we're taking this entire thing"
6032500,6037940," so okay so here's the current vertex we're taking the jth face we're looking at that face and within that face"
6037940,6044420," we're looking at vertex here's the neighbor index and so we're only looking at the vertices that are not visited"
6044420,6055300," since us ourselves are already visited that thing is going to exclude ourselves then we're adding it to the next wave and we need to mark this thing as visited as well"
6055300,6061940," well so this is something that we missed so this is why i like to go through complex algorithms that i write"
6061940,6067300," one more time so i don't miss anything by the way if you are competitive programmer you probably know this"
6067300,6072820," kind of thing like you can probably type it out like very blindly since i'm not a very good competitive"
6072820,6081220," programmer and i haven't had any practice for quite some time so you see i'm very slow on that uh so yeah"
6081220,6084500," so visit it of course"
6084500,6092260," all right so and this entire thing should construct a new next wave that should be used on the next iteration"
6092260,6099380," since we process the old wave we kind of just uh reset the counter and then we just swap them out right so"
6099380,6105460," temporary we save the wave so that means we can modify the wave we put next wave and that swaps out"
6105460,6113380," this entire thing uh two arrays instead of q exactly exactly so this could have been much easier like we"
6113380,6119860," wouldn't have to do this weird tricks if we just had a q but i don't want to implement the q i don't really"
6119860,6123460," have it in this language and i don't want to implement it so it's easier to just have two arrays"
6124100,6128340," so it kind of supplements that what's funny is that i kind of invented this technique myself"
6128340,6133940," i never looked it up anywhere but i'm pretty sure it's a really well-known technique right so but i"
6133940,6140740," kind of came to that technique myself right so instead of q just two arrays um let's have this recursive"
6140740,6146500," algorithm for depth first the recursive algorithm they are dangerous in the sense that they can stack"
6146500,6153700," overflow right and what's interesting is that we have here uh thousands of the vertices like the meshes are"
6153700,6160980," pretty complex so i didn't think um i didn't think recursive algorithm is a good idea in here unless we"
6160980,6163860," just extend the size of the stack but i don't want to be filled in with that"
6163860,6169060," yeah so i think the recursion will explode in here so it's better to just do it like this"
6170980,6176580," okay so that's basically what we have in here let's try to build it uh it may actually hang"
6176580,6182340," right so because maybe i made a mistake somewhere here so we'll see we'll see um so let's do tools"
6182340,6189940," uh let's do tools so what do we have uh static assert so implicit declaration of function static assert okay"
6189940,6196660," um i suppose we need to include a certain here so because i'm sure it has to be included in here"
6197620,6207060," uh so implicitly c99 why do i explicitly say that it has to be c99 does anybody remember why i explicitly"
6207060,6215700," said it's c99 like like why i don't remember honestly but anyway so uh there's start uh okay"
6215700,6224900," so we're adding that to wave so that's understandable uh-huh and there is another thing undefined yeah so it"
6224900,6232820," complains about brov brobski brobski what the how how come"
6232820,6237620," can i just have"
6237620,6248260," recursive with trump line maybe is that a good idea to just switch to c11 because i kind of want to have a"
6248260,6257300," a static assert with this thing but anyway so uh if it works it works yeah let's take a look at the assets"
6257300,6262580," 10 components with panger holy"
6265780,6277220," uta teapot has 4 components i'm sorry for being too loud but i mean this is so cool remember how i said"
6277220,6283460," that the uta teapot is gonna have four components spout the body the handle and the cap here they are"
6283460,6290340," four components here they are man this is so cool yo"
6293140,6297860," okay so and the panger has 10 components right so which is a lot but i mean that's fine"
6297860,6304180," low poly uh cup right so you can you can even take a look at that right so there's obviously four"
6304180,6310660," components in here right so it's just like a spout handle and body and the cap so this one obviously has"
6310660,6316900," two components right it's it's like the handle and the the vessel like what's what's the official word for"
6316900,6326020," that right so here we have 10 of them well i mean i'm pretty sure like leg each leg body and beak"
6326020,6334740," they are separate components so big body left right hand and if there is an outer shell maybe outer shell"
6334740,6340340," actually mimics them so there's at least at least eight of them so if there's 10 components there's maybe"
6340340,6346500," something additional like two additional components two separate additional components uh so author of"
6346500,6356900," 3d panger must confirm the parts maybe the eyes eyes i thought eyes are like um um how to say that like"
6356900,6365060," uh texture one company is a big a huge tip"
6365060,6372980," well i mean it's just like ball sack and the dick itself right so the the two missing components right so"
6377380,6386100," we found them the two missing components only one well i mean just to save on on space just like uh you"
6386100,6394100," know in the form in the shape of a heart just a ball sack like an inverted heart ball sack and so it's two"
6394100,6405140," components um but anyway so what i wanted to do how can we strip of strip of those mother flippers um"
6406500,6413140," that's very interesting and we need to the way i want to strip them off is that i want to have an"
6413140,6421380," index right so i want to specify okay strip of uh nth components stripping off nth component is going to"
6421380,6435060," be a matter of removing vertices belonging to that component not even vertices but faces rather rather faces so oh"
6436020,6443140," yeah that's going to be interesting i suppose it's going to be interesting what i'm thinking"
6443140,6453860," what i'm thinking broskis uh i think we need to reform visited field of the vertex"
6453860,6461780," uh so essentially we want it to be a component uh component"
6463780,6470980," zero means this mother flipper does not belong to any components and then one two three and so"
6470980,6479700," on and so forth means the index of the component it belongs to that way it may act both as the visited"
6479700,6486180," fields which denotes that like we already visited we already classify that vertex as being part of the"
6486180,6493460," the certain component or as not visited right and as soon as we did the entire bfs each individual"
6493460,6497220," vertex is going to have an index of the component it belongs to"
6497220,6511540," five head five head idea i think it's pretty cool i really like this idea actually so let's give it a try let's give it a try"
6511540,6518100," let's give it a try so and we already have like the current component because we do comp count and that's"
6518100,6525860," basically the index of holy shit it's so fucking coming together it's so freaking coming together"
6525860,6531380," holy shit anyway so uh let's actually go to the compilation errors uh let's go to the compilation"
6531380,6539860," scenario so again tools uh yes yes so yes so visited i can literally just do not components right so because"
6539860,6546580," zero indicates that it's so it probably makes sense to actually denote that so zero means uh never visited"
6548020,6562020," visit it uh greater than zero uh is the index of the component vertex belongs to uh reflecting will be"
6562020,6569540," nice yeah so it's going to be super easy uh you just follow these things and here i marked as visited but"
6569540,6573700," now i have to give it an index and what is the index it's cop count"
6575380,6582340," it's a comp count uh right so it's super easy uh right so it's actually super natural that's cool"
6582340,6597380," um so not visited uh components not component uh comp count oh right yo component"
6600980,6607380," okay okay that's pretty cool so now we need to have some sort of a field i presume so it's going to do"
6607380,6615780," assets uh it's it's also it's still super fast by the way doing all of the analysis of all of the"
6615780,6625060," assets we have we have four obg files one of them has uh 30 000 versus and 6 000 faces analysis and"
6625060,6630180," transformation of all of them is below 100 milliseconds"
6630180,6638180," one base component index yeah unfortunately all right so this is something that we have to deal with"
6638180,6647460," uh c is fast confirmed i don't think c is just like a free right it's fast because it just like does"
6647460,6659140," minimal amount of bullshit uh right so that's why essentially um we can now uh have a flag"
6659140,6662900," so let's have something like"
6662900,6668980," how are we going to be doing all of this how are we going to be doing all of this um"
6672420,6679540," so we take a look at the face face has three vertices right so this one is rather interesting"
6679540,6688260," this one is rather interesting so we're going to be deleting components by deleting faces not vertices"
6688260,6693060," so that's kind of important so we're going to keep the vertices in but we're going to delete the faces"
6694420,6699700," so you have a face which is three vertices right so which is three vertices"
6699700,6713460," all right so i look at the face i look at the face and i look at this uh vertex i look at this vertex"
6715220,6725860," uh and i don't include the entire face i don't include the entire face into the final generation if"
6725860,6732660," um any of the faces belong to the component that we're trying to remove"
6732660,6737460," i think that's the way to go about that right so"
6737460,6741460," that's an interesting way to do that so that way we can"
6742020,6749220," it's super easy to test by the way especially with the um the utility port right so it has four"
6749220,6754820," components and deleting one of the components is going to be a very profound effect right so it's just"
6754820,6761540," the entire spout will disappear or an entire handle will disappear uh so yeah i think that's going to be"
6761540,6770020," the the way we're going to go about that uh huh all right so here are different sort of parameters"
6770020,6774740," and the flags and the flags that we have on here uh so i suppose we're going to have a like delete"
6774740,6779540," delete component and initially is going to be zero right so"
6779540,6789140," how we're going to be doing all of that so i suppose the flag for deleting a certain component"
6789140,6797220," or component is going to be strcmp flag d uh it's going to be zero uh all right and we have to provide the"
6797220,6807780," the the value uh so let's copy paste this check uh and then we can parse the value so the way we parse"
6807780,6814660," the value is rather interesting right so here's the value we're extracting it and delete component um"
6814660,6822020," so a to i i think that's what we want to do in here is that is that what it is a to i um so it converts a"
6822020,6828260," string to an integer and that's precisely what we want to have here uh let me try to recompile the"
6828260,6835380," whole thingy majingy uh so it's going to be tools it's going to be tools delete components is never used"
6835380,6846660," okay so um here we are generating things so we're generating the code we are generating the code uh so we're"
6846660,6852740," going through the vertices through the vertices through the faces so the thing is uh we also need to print"
6852740,6857380," the amount of faces we've got so we need to kind of know this up front"
6857380,6867620," so delete components components let's pass this information in let's pass this information in"
6868180,6874740," and uh yeah delete components delete components delete components"
6874740,6887380," all right uh so again the way we're going to be doing all that we're going to be looking at the faces"
6890260,6899220," all right all right so faces count zero for all of these faces"
6899220,6903300," faces items i"
6903300,6911940," we probably want to have some sort of a"
6914820,6923540," function function is deleted face we have to provide the vertices the current face we're deleting"
6923540,6932260," and the deleted components right and if it's not a deleted face we say okay so this is part of all of"
6932260,6939380," the faces right so this is part of all the faces and uh this is what we're going to be using instead of the"
6939380,6947460," the faces count right so this is like um let's call it visible faces count to just distinguish it from the"
6947460,6956420," actual faces count right so it's going to be visible uh faces count uh and in here uh visible faces count"
6956420,6967860," like so cool i'm really happy to see that so and then after that we just reuse the same thing in here like"
6967860,6974340," so so so we need to now implement this function uh huh let's put it in here so it's going to be"
6974340,6984260," obviously boolean uh it's going to be accepting vertices vertices uh and the face so is face a very big"
6984260,6993620," structure no it is not i think it's totally fine so we can actually afford passing it and deleted"
6993620,6996580," component okay why are we're going to be using this component component okay why are you doing that broski"
6996580,7001060," broski okay so what we're going to be doing in here we're going to be iterating through"
7001060,7011060," the vertices right so basically vertices per face like so uh plus plus i um obviously will be the blender"
7011060,7019460," like array leap to unity maybe um so if uh vertices items"
7020900,7032100," face v i um components equal to delete component return true"
7032100,7036820," otherwise return false"
7036820,7045620," isn't that poggers my different is not poggers i think that's pretty freaking poggers"
7048740,7053380," oh it only occurred to me wait a freaking second"
7053380,7059860," wait people were spamming plus plus j because"
7066020,7087220," okay okay i just i just unbanned them did it unbanned them actually uh i i don't know"
7089540,7093700," i i don't know if it didn't bend them oh yeah okay so it's not bent in this channel"
7093700,7100500," grilled guest if you if you're watching it right now i i'm so fucking sorry"
7100500,7105780," it only occurs to me now like holy shit"
7105780,7109700," um i'm i'm such a fucking idiot like"
7111540,7117620," i swear to god sometimes when i used to watch my words back uh i would be looking at the"
7117620,7121300," shit i do and just like brah you're so fucking stupid like holy"
7121300,7129860," but again i'm streaming like uh half of my iq is actually engaged in like trying to keep up with all"
7129860,7139460," all of that stuff so all right anyway i'm sorry so some stuff like that happens to me from time to time"
7139460,7140100," so i apologize"
7140100,7142500," anyways"
7142500,7149300," so deleted uh deleted component so let's actually try to rebuild the whole thing"
7149300,7155780," uh so faces count it's a visible faces count specifically right so it's a visible faces count"
7156420,7162340," and okay so that seems to be working that seems to be what it's working so how about that above that"
7162340,7170020," but you didn't expect that to happen um so now uh let's actually go to no builds"
7170020,7172340," let's go to no builds and i want to"
7172340,7176740," go to build assets"
7176740,7186260," and for the uta teapot we can try to delete something let's delete uh the first component"
7187060,7191780," let's try to delete the first component okay so i'm rebuilding the tools"
7191780,7198980," cool i'm rebuilding the assets i'm building the assets and i'm rebuilding the demos"
7198980,7210420," uh c pot 3d i think i think that's the one i'm going to be rebuilding okay let's refresh the whole thing"
7210420,7218100," uh surprisingly uh surprisingly the first component also includes spout"
7218100,7223620," but nonetheless this motherfucker just works"
7227940,7233700," this entire freaking idea actually works uh all right so i'm going to actually reduce the class"
7233700,7238180," because apparently they were not throwing me uh you know back then so"
7238180,7247460," uh so yeah i was just stupid i was just stupid so we can actually identify certain components and we"
7247460,7252900," can remove certain components this is cool plus plus j"
7252900,7256020," anyway uh"
7256020,7264180," let's try to maybe remove other components right so uh let's take a look at the second component what if"
7264180,7270580," i remove the second component so no build um assets and review the whole thing"
7270580,7277140," you you tell it underside"
7277140,7286660," okay so the second one is a probably you tell it on the site components one base because zero means no"
7286660,7293380," components deleted so i suppose it's part of the um you know lead one of the components actually part of the"
7293380,7294660," delete um"
7294660,7303140," okay okay so it's probably i can't really rotate it properly unfortunately"
7303140,7312180," um so yeah and probably for the um for the panger we'll have to delete several components in there"
7312180,7317620," at some point we'll probably have to delete several components so what about the fourth component suppose the"
7317620,7323060," fourth component is a spout um"
7323060,7333460," and this is a spout okay man this is such a useful this is a very useful tool what the"
7333460,7340740," like this is an ironically useful uh unfortunately right now we can only delete one component at a time"
7341300,7348740," right one component at a time but um we can easily add deleting several components uh right so"
7348740,7357700," utable yeah this is a utable without any spout so and i just like assume that maybe outer shell is"
7358580,7366740," uh yeah several components and i'm sure how easy it would be for us to see that like if for example"
7366740,7377380," outer shell of the body is one separate component deleting it would not be apparently visible for us so it"
7377380,7387140," it would be just the body has shranked shrunk we need a way to have uh to compare pangers side by side"
7389060,7393460," call it the components differently that's an interesting idea but the demos don't have"
7393460,7398500," information about the components yet we do not propagate that information to the to the demo"
7398500,7407140," so it's something that our processing tool only knows uh we could actually add that information actually"
7409700,7412980," hmm that's an interesting idea honestly yeah"
7412980,7421700," if you don't see what got removed you remove the correct thing on technically yeah i guess technically"
7421700,7429700," that's true uh all right so this is a very cool freaking feature that we've got in here so and if i"
7429700,7438180," just don't delete anything uh right if i just don't delete anything uh right i think texture and when"
7438180,7442340," probably not today because we're already streaming for more than two hours so it's a little bit too"
7442340,7448260," much for me so it's a bit too stressful uh yeah so now we have the entire everything in here"
7448260,7454020," and man today's stream was actually kind of cool um so i think it was kind of cool"
7454020,7461940," oh righty so uh i think i'm gonna commit uh this entire thing so what exactly did we do in here"
7462740,7470820," uh i suppose we just added the ability to delete components of the thing right an ability to delete"
7470820,7471380," components"
7471380,7485860," so obg2c implement uh minus d flag that deletes um components components of the mesh"
7486820,7491380," all right all right i'm gonna push that right into the ripple uh what about moving components"
7491380,7500740," so they separate in the grid we can also do that can't we since faces they are just"
7500740,7505860," meta information that connects together vertices um and we know which vertices belong to which"
7505860,7510740," components we can just iterate all the vertices find the vertices that belong to a certain component and"
7510740,7516340," do modifications on them that's actually kind of cool so we can manipulate certain components in whatever"
7516340,7517780," way um"
7517780,7527540," i uh i think i saw that obgc can handle multiple of the same flag well probably actually wait a second"
7528100,7532180," that's a that's a that's a cool idea just a second um"
7532180,7535540," we can"
7535540,7545220," we can just have this as an array so essentially every time we encounter d we just append that delete"
7545220,7553700," component to a dynamic array okay so components and struct"
7554740,7563860," compile component indices indices indices that's a cool idea so int"
7563860,7568740," items size uh count"
7568740,7571380," capacity"
7571380,7580740," and this is delete components and this is basically empty so let's actually go to the compilation errors"
7580740,7584020," uh super quick uh super quick so it's going to be tools"
7584020,7589940," uh-huh all right all right so and in here we're going to just do da append"
7589940,7602260," like so i think i need to call it components to indicate that it's plural all right so generate code"
7604340,7610980," component indices uh component indices i think it's uh yeah it's defined down there so let's actually define"
7610980,7615620," it up there uh-huh and let's"
7615620,7620580," pass all of that information there"
7620580,7626180," so delete components so is deleted face"
7627940,7629140," components"
7629140,7635060," components indices it's probably again defined two below i really hate c in the sense that"
7635060,7641140," like it's so old-fashioned right so you have to define types in a certain way it's just like so"
7641140,7653620," annoying uh all right so for uh size t j j less than delete components count uh plus plus i"
7657220,7667940," all right so and delete components items j so it's in four okay i'm joking um so i think that's the"
7667940,7672500," thing we want to do in here that's the thing we want to do all right so let's go to the compilation"
7677380,7692260," it's plural it's plural it's plural it's plural it's plural all right so now i'm gonna go to no build"
7692260,7699140," and essentially in mind the further by the further i can delete several of them so what if what if i delete"
7700340,7711060," one one and i delete three how what would you do now what would you do now my friend uh all right so"
7711060,7719220," let's refer to this entire choice it didn't work because i didn't properly rebuild assets i need to"
7719220,7729540," rebuild the assets and then uh demos uh teapot 3d all right so that's what i need to do"
7729620,7733460," uh-huh refresh this choice"
7733460,7746980," fuck me didn't work why didn't okay i'm sad uh why it didn't work exactly what did i fuck up"
7746980,7754100," what did i fuck up do i append so this is empty all right so when i generate the code"
7755540,7762500," uh i just check whether certain thing is deleted or not i'm checking it several times it must be some"
7762500,7771220," problem in here um it must be some problem in here so this is a component delete components um"
7773780,7779300," yeah so if any"
7779300,7789380," if any vertices of the current phase is part of the deleted components it's just like instantly true"
7789380,7799700," so what did i miss what did i miss in here like i missed something obvious uh so components count maybe it"
7799700,7809300," makes sense for me to print the deleted components right deleted uh components uh like so uh and the way"
7809300,7814260," we're going to do that i'm going to iterate the deleted components essentially so because i'm not sure if it's"
7814980,7823860," correct delete components uh correct delete components uh count plus plus i so and essentially what we're"
7823860,7835620," doing in here is just space uh d delete components item i and then just print f plus plus j"
7839140,7839460," okay okay"
7839460,7852500," oh i suppose i okay i need to also rebuild tools this build system sucks ass"
7852500,7860820," uh so yeah okay so probably yeah i think i know what this is going on brovsky"
7861620,7871460," broovsky i think i know one more time yeah so here are deleted components one and three because we"
7871460,7884180," explicitly said so uh these are the deleted components uh my mouse is dead bro okay so now as you can see we"
7884180,7892820," we deleted several components i suppose uh so one of them is the tip of the lid i remember i just"
7892820,7897300," remember the name so you you're supposed to see the tip of the lid in here but you can't see that"
7897300,7902820," uh right so we can actually now delete several components thank you so much for whoever suggested that"
7902820,7912420," uh all right so we can try to delete some of the components of panger your mouth is banger um okay"
7913300,7919460," so d one let's delete the first component so let's go"
7919460,7924740," so thank you so much everyone who subscribed by the way i was"
7924740,7927780," neglecting the subs i really apologize for that just a second"
7927780,7934340," so uh miralai koshka thank you so much for twitch prime with the message print tab hello world hello"
7934340,7939300," world indeed unlimited quarter two thank you so much for which prime nulligore thank you so much for tier one"
7939940,7945300," thank you thank you thank you thank you so let's take a look at what we got"
7945300,7956020," so as somebody said uh we deleted the right component i suppose i don't know what's the difference between"
7956020,7965460," them honestly i might as well actually actually i have an idea i may delete so i can put zero in here and it"
7965460,7971300," will not delete any components right so it's actually kind of convenient and i'm going to refresh the whole"
7971300,7977860," thing i'm going to rebuild the whole thing and i'm going to keep this thing open uh and i'm going to open"
7977860,7990420," open it side side by side so is it rebuilt i think it's already rebuilt uh so oh boy oh boy oh boy"
7991620,8000340," i don't see any difference i guess it did in fact deleted a huge dick invisible is there any difference"
8000340,8004820," really maybe it's going to be visible from behind"
8004820,8010820," now it's kind of hard to see"
8013380,8017620," maybe delete all and add one by one that's an interesting idea actually"
8017620,8023060," delete events uh then odds"
8023060,8031460," i don't know so it it's better would be to actually color than different one"
8031460,8036020," uh looks a little thinner but yeah hard to see yeah that's exactly the problem so we can delete"
8036020,8043460," uh certain components it's totally fine but it's hard to tell which one we have deleted one of the things"
8043460,8051940," we can do okay we can actually just implement the texturing as it is without deleting any components"
8051940,8060100," just implement the texturing then as soon as we implemented that we can start experimenting with different"
8060820,8068740," um with different uh components removing them and seeing if that reveals the texture or not"
8068740,8073700," this is one of the things working but we're not going to be doing it right now because i'm already"
8073700,8079940," streaming for like a third hour it's already almost a third hour so i think it is time for me uh to go"
8079940,8086980," right so um yeah that's it for today thanks everyone who's watching right now today's stream was actually"
8086980,8092500," kind of cool we implemented cool stuff uh i really appreciate everyone watching have a good one"
8092500,8099860," and i see you all on the next recreation programming session with a who a who amist i love you all"
