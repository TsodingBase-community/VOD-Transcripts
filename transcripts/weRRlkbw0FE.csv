0,22240," you ready kids are you ready"
22240,27280," let's go"
30000,41760," i wonder what can be the best okay so there's a"
41760,46560," lead code website i'm not referring to lead code"
46560,53760," fuck that uh fuck that mate is there like a"
56320,61200," i don't know look at wikipedia article about that"
61200,69280," um everybody's talking about this thing but there's a tree rotation again"
69280,71680," yeah"
71680,78560," okay that's what i do hello second what's up"
78800,85200," inverse because that's what we're trying to do yeah"
85200,92560," all right and it's not particularly what i think it is"
92560,99600," um hello everyone hello very glad to see you so today we actually doing something interesting"
100400,105840," um today i'm going to be learning std file system because i never actually used it in my life"
105840,110960," i was supposed to watch and sermon of course hello hello"
110960,117040," so std file system right so it's a part of this c plus plus standard library and it allows you to work"
117040,128880," with files um with files uh so it was introduced in c plus plus 17 if i'm not mistaken right and i"
128880,135680," never really tried uh a lot of things in a standard library since c plus plus 17 even since c plus plus"
135680,143920," 14. so i started to learn c plus plus when the active standard was i think c plus plus zero three"
143920,154000," right before c plus plus 11 um so yeah and i wanted to try to you know see how good of the library it"
154000,162240," is it's cute easy to use nice i'm very glad to hear that so uh so the idea it's kind of like boring to"
162240,167600," just go through the library and its functions and stuff like that it will be like a little bit more"
167600,175200," interesting to um do some sort of an exercise and the exercise i came up with is inverting the file tree"
175200,183360," right so there is a classical example of inverting binary tree invert binary tree and i couldn't really"
183360,193680," find uh anything uh yeah so the idea is essentially you just mirror a tree right you just mirror a tree"
194880,199760," oh my god my god where's my uh tablet"
199760,222640," it takes so much time to actually start everything up i wish my pain was a little bit faster uh it doesn't"
222640,232880," my pain doesn't even do anything to be that slow in my opinion uh right so um let me maybe readjust"
232880,240480," everything so there's something like this uh huh so and then we can have something like that"
240480,252400," right and in here we have one two three four uh five so the idea of inverting the tree the idea of"
252400,262640," inverting the tree is essentially mirroring it horizontally right so if you rotate it let me"
262640,268720," actually quickly do that it's going to be something like this one so three is on the right so the three"
268720,275520," is going to be on the left right three is going to be on the left two is going to be on the right so and"
275520,282640," in two five is on the right so it's going to be on the left it's going to go like that five and then it's"
282640,288640," going to be uh four like that so this is how you invert a binary tree um and you do that usually"
288640,296400," recursively so now imagine that you have a file tree and you want to do the same but with the files"
298240,304640," so um but uh with the files a file system unfortunately is not a binary tree in case of a"
304640,313520," binary tree it in it has up to two uh children so you can just swap the children around so file system"
313520,321840," usually looks like this it has many many children right it has many many children and um how would you"
321840,329920," you know rotate it or maybe flip it you will have to reverse this array right you will have to reverse"
329920,339280," this array um so and how would you reverse like files um i suppose reversing the file is going to be"
339280,347280," basically um switching their contents right a rotating binary tree is essentially going to be like literally"
347280,351920," switching the contents and whatnot and i think the easiest way to do that would be to actually rename"
351920,356160," the files we're going to achieve that through the naming so the idea is going to be that you recursively"
356160,362720," go down the by the the file tree and as you unwind from recursion you're going to be actually swapping"
362720,369520," things around and eventually you're basically going to flip the whole tree um horizontally so i think it's"
369520,378560," a very interesting exercise and uh we'll see if it's possible to do that in cc plus plus um should be"
378560,388640," possible with a file system and it should be cross-platform all right so uh let me see so we're going to have"
388640,400320," what to do uh we're going to have to do so we first need to implement where is my to do to do.org"
400320,409840," file tree generator we first need to generate some data right"
415120,422960," okay uh okay uh we need to generate some data for this entire stuff and then uh file tree uh inverter"
422960,430640," inverter inverter is it inverter i think it has to be inverter um all right"
430640,442560," what's up tech to the attack 256 yes inverter thank you thank you so much hello hello"
445120,453120," google google translate actually improved over over the years because it always struggles to properly"
453120,459280," translate english to to russian um and it goes quite well so just programming in c plus plus"
459280,469280," um as you can see inverting file trees and stuff like that i'm learning std file system and i decided to"
469280,477040," just to just make us just to do a small exercise of uh inverting a file tree it's like inverting a tree"
477040,483600," but it's file tree uh one guy which doesn't speak any english so i use google translate to talk to him"
483600,488480," oh nice okay okay so i remember like a long time ago google translate what app was absolutely horrible"
488480,494000," uh because the grammar of russian language is more complicated than the english one and it's just like"
494000,499760," difficult to map things between them especially there's also like a lot of idioms and stuff like that"
499760,506800," yeah so uh they're using um artificial intelligence now"
506800,514240," so file tree generator so i also want to actually add some stuff to the readme um"
516800,529120," to the readme so word binary tree so where can i find a link to invert binary tree so people can read"
529120,543360," about this entire thing um okay i have an idea uh brew package manager so yeah i can refer to this tweet"
544560,550640," so the reason why inverting binary tree became such a meme is because of this specific tweet"
550640,558960," by the creator of uh of the uh brew right homebrew i think it's the package manager for for mac os"
558960,563120," and 90 percent of our engineers use the software you roll from brew but you cannot invert binary and"
563120,573920," on the whiteboard so off so okay i'm gonna actually refer to this tweet um this is like uh inverting"
574800,578080," inverting binary tree"
578080,596080," right but instead of the binary tree it's file system tree right all right uh cool"
603840,611200," all right so binary tree but it's a file uh but it's a file tree"
611200,625680," this is intended as a simple egg exercise exercise do did i spell it correctly i don't remember how to spell"
625680,633680," exercise uh yes i did spell it correctly exercise to learn uh how to use a"
633680,637680," std file system right so it's gonna be a std file system right so it's gonna be a std file system"
637680,641920," and let's refer to std file system like this"
641920,650720," so let me see let's generate some data i suppose um"
650720,661200," so it's gonna be data right and then uh we're gonna have something like maybe um just a second"
662960,673040," full uh full uh and maybe file bar right which will contain uh hello bar right so we have foo and bar"
673040,676400," uh right and then"
676400,680560," we're gonna have something like hello"
684960,699440," uh hello um world i want to do that to be a file world okay so we have something like this is there any"
699440,707360," way for me to look at it as a tree is there like tree utility there is a tree utility so i can use it"
707360,719520," actually uh all right so let me see it's gonna be c plus plus invert file tree so tree data uh cool"
722400,724400," so i'm gonna i'm gonna grab that"
724400,744960," the idea is to implement a program that can transform this and this is going to be consoler"
746640,759920," uh didn't properly copy paste it yeah uh this into into this and let me see how it's going to work"
759920,765760," actually uh unfortunately it's not going to be really visible that these things like are inversed or"
765760,787760," so if i swap this thing these two files they will swap their content i wonder if tree can uh show a little"
787760,803120," bit of a content maybe they can uh i could do hello hello hello uh cat data um full hello um"
803120,809200," it doesn't have a new line unfortunately uh let me actually save it with a new line"
809200,817520," uh yeah so now it actually did more than new line it's really weird so if i take a look so there's"
818480,822240," i don't understand i don't understand okay so now it does exactly what i want"
822240,829440," it does exactly what i want i wish my mouse was a little bit more reliable"
829440,841760," and another thing is going to be the world this one is going to contain world right so that's going to be"
841760,851520," be the idea so when this entire stuff is transformed all right so hello and the world in foo are going to"
851520,855440," stay the same they're going to stay the same"
856240,860960," um so but"
860960,868240," this one is going to become world this can become hello um"
870960,876720," and here yeah what's up what's up what's up what's up we're doing something cool actually"
876720,884240," uh i'm learning std file system and i decided to implement uh inverting"
884240,889840," binary tree but on the file system so we're going to take file system as a file tree and"
889840,895200," we're going to invert it and we'll see how it goes it's actually really difficult to formalize this"
895680,900640," uh but i'm trying so this thing if we're going to invert it by renaming that means that"
900640,905840," this will become uh bar and this will become full now yes"
906400,915680," um this will become bar and this will become full um so on the other hand maybe"
915680,918080," um"
918080,928720," yeah something like this okay so this is my idea um okay we don't have any quick start yet"
929360,936240," and then we're going to have a license which is going to be under mit uh and um let me create"
936240,945520," super quick and make file so it's going to be cxx flex and it's going to be w all w extra"
945520,954080," um then std c++17 and then it's going to be pedantic all right and it's going to be"
955920,962800," uh right now what i need i need to implement the generator right so yeah it's going to be a generator"
962800,975600," so we have a generator hello generator generator uh-huh and uh inverter is going to be cpp"
978480,990240," uh-huh uh-huh return like this uh c out a low inverter"
990240,1005760," i'm really sorry yes um it is what it is and it isn't what isn't is it not i think it is"
1006880,1018000," um cxx cxx cxx flex and uh generator cpp do we are we going to have anything else uh in here i think"
1018000,1024560," not so i'm going to quickly replace this thing with inverter right and i'm going to add this to all"
1024560,1035840," generator inverter and this is going to be a phony target right is that how i forgot how to do a phony"
1035840,1044160," target i think i think i think it's just that wait i forgot uh make file phony what i haven't written"
1044160,1053760," yes this is how i don't know why i just okay okay i'm sorry just forgot how to do that"
1053760,1064720," all right nice cool uh i can also try to do that with clang clang plus plus i mean i have to actually force"
1065280,1072880," reevaluation of this entire stuff and um yeah there we go so i'm going to have a generator and we're"
1072880,1075280," going to have an inverter there we go"
1075280,1085040," uh so now we're going to have some sort of a quick start quick start and it's going to be console"
1085040,1094720," hola and in here we're going to do make and then um generator we probably have to provide the the name for the"
1094720,1104560," uh for the folder um then tree data uh tree data then uh inverter"
1104560,1112320," data and then three data"
1112320,1115120," there we go"
1116320,1123920," um kind of a that's basically the idea here i guess that's the plan that's the plan at least um"
1123920,1128400," maybe maybe it's going to be changed like in the future somehow i don't know"
1128400,1136400," uh so i also want to get to ignore some of these things uh generator uh and inverter"
1138400,1143600," i don't need that maybe i'm going to even get to ignore the data right because it's going to be"
1143600,1144720," generated all the time"
1145520,1154400," uh"
1154400,1158080," get in it all right"
1158080,1162800," can we commit now okay but didn't i"
1166480,1167680," do i have to do it like that"
1167680,1171200," okay"
1171200,1182560," ready set go sorting gun uh let me go and create a week for that"
1191280,1195440," thank thank god holy so"
1195440,1204160," this exact thing this exact thing used to leak your mobile phone"
1204160,1214080," seriously it used to leak your mobile phone now it doesn't now it just shows uh last four digits well"
1214080,1223040," like it leaked something but yeah uh so i specifically made a feature request for them like i explained"
1223040,1229920," guys i'm a streamer and i do programming on the stream and i quite often use github"
1229920,1238080," your page pops up like out of nowhere and it may leak very sensitive information please do something"
1238080,1244640," please just at least like make me click on it to show the full number like just don't leak it"
1244640,1253680," and they actually implemented it they actually i'm so goddamn happy it does okay uh so"
1253680,1259920," holy i'm so happy that at some point in my life i actually"
1259920,1266640," spent time contacting them and asking please fix that this is very important"
1267200,1277040," like holy shit i'm now so so glad um so yeah and because like it may pop out out of nowhere like"
1277040,1286240," like suddenly uh it's just like yeah uh and there's nothing you you can't control that whatsoever um yeah"
1286240,1289200," okay"
1294560,1300400," well they actually give a well i spend a lot of time actually explaining my use case and my workflow"
1300400,1306560," and giving them as much information as possible why it is important and i guess that was helpful"
1306560,1314480," so like i wrote a huge letter uh explaining everything okay um"
1321680,1325920," so it's going to be something like this uh this is going to be public and"
1325920,1331840," uh excuse me oh yeah it has to be a description all right"
1331840,1345120," i guess i have to call it cxx uh yes i have to call it cxx not not cpp cpp is a super processor"
1347120,1355120," uh so maybe because of that i need to rename this to cxx uh right it's going to be cxx and uh all right"
1355120,1362560," uh so i'm going to try to do the following this is like inverting binary tree but instead of binary"
1362560,1368320," tree it's file tree okay so i'm going to use this as the description i'm going to use this as the"
1368320,1381760," the description um instead of the binary tree it's it's instead of instead of a binary tree it's a file"
1381760,1401520," tree it's like inverting binary tree but instead of instead of it has to be there because i'm referring"
1401520,1409040," to the binary tree that i introduced in the like previous part of the sentence it's uh yeah yeah i guess"
1409040,1415600," i guess that's i don't know how to speak english seriously um and i cannot modify the description"
1415600,1420720," unless i committed something in here thank you github very cool um all right"
1420720,1436800," okay i'm gonna call it typo and i need to add origin like that i need to add origin like that and uh let's"
1436800,1437520," push this thing"
1437520,1447840," did i push it over actually no i didn't uh i just edit the remote"
1447840,1459760," okay all right so you can find the source code of this thing in here um so nothing is implemented i just"
1459760,1468880," like made a stub of this entire step uh and um yeah so nothing is implemented yet keep that in mind"
1471520,1483840," uh what's up um so i'm just trying to think did i forget anything i think i didn't forget anything"
1483840,1491440," hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully i think everything has been done all right so i can"
1491440,1500720," finally focus on what i'm going to generate in here all right so um according to readme we accept the path to the"
1500720,1508160," to the data folder why the command line arguments right so let's quickly try to do something in here"
1508160,1522720," here it's going to be in the org c char org v all right so if arg c is um less than two so you need to"
1522720,1527760," provide at least uh at least the the like one argument in there so stg error uh i think it's c error and we're going to do something like um no we need to print it as a usage right so we're going to"
1527760,1550720," accept the usage and if i remember correctly so c error is a std uh all string right so we're going to accept it as that uh all stream so we will be able to print um to"
1550720,1563760," um to see error if you want to or to standard output or whatever right so the usage is going to be the following uh usage um generator"
1563760,1571120," uh and it's going to be um i don't know folder path right it's going to be folder path"
1571120,1576400," and it's going to be this thing i think if i remember correctly you have to include all stream in here"
1576400,1586240," so to actually to actually be available um okay um so it's going to be error so maybe i'm also going to"
1586240,1591360," do something like usage std c error right and"
1591360,1593680," um"
1593680,1602320," folder path is not provided"
1604320,1613040," std and handle where is my team"
1631440,1637840," so it's going to be a folder path and i suppose i can just do something like this right um"
1637840,1642880," std c out um folder path"
1642880,1646000," folder path"
1646000,1657840," so okay that looks all right let's try to maybe build this entire stuff and see if it builds"
1658480,1666240," seems to be building so can i do something like generator um okay so terminate um throwing an"
1666240,1667520," instance logic error"
1667520,1675360," oh yeah i forgot to actually exit from from this entire step of course"
1675360,1681520," make the generator throws exceptions and"
1681520,1686880," change it um as well actually just return my like one"
1686880,1696960," uh and if i provide something like data if i provide something like data uh it says folder data"
1696960,1706160," okay that's cool so we managed to accept uh the folder path as an argument so uh the thing i want to do now i want to"
1706160,1711440," try to create a folder uh in there uh how can i create a folder uh how can i create a folder"
1711440,1718880," so std file path std file path and what do i have to include to have std file path"
1718880,1720880," file system okay"
1724560,1734800," so let's include file system um so include file system um is it create yeah it's literally create"
1734800,1742480," directory and you can actually create several directories um so creates a directory so if it's several of them"
1744880,1752560," um crazy director p as if uh in the second argument i suppose it just creates all of them along the way"
1752560,1753920," all right"
1753920,1762080," that's a pretty cool way of doing that yeah i like that thank you very cool"
1764240,1764960," so um"
1764960,1765200," so um"
1765200,1767200," yeah"
1767200,1777920," yeah it's just make deals mind yeah i thought so i thought so so essentially like if if you"
1777920,1782560," implement no build in c plus plus you already have half of the functionality of no build"
1782560,1787600," and in a cross-platform way as well yeah that's that's kind of cool"
1787600,1792720," um maybe maybe it does make sense to have no build ccpp"
1793840,1800000," it's not bad it's not bad at all because the the file system is a primary thing that you have to"
1800000,1800800," work with anyway"
1800800,1816400," so how are we gonna generate uh just a random thing um i'm thinking uh maybe"
1816400,1823440," uh at any level right at any level we're gonna generate randomly"
1823440,1830320," from a to b amount of entries and as we generate each entry there is a chance for an entry to become"
1830320,1838480," either a file or a folder and if it becomes a folder we go deeper see what i mean so you're at"
1838480,1844960," any particular level generate a number like from a particular range from two to three and that number"
1844960,1850960," is the amount of files you have to create and this file can be either um a file or a directory if it's a"
1850960,1856800," file it terminates if it's not and that way you can generate like a random thing uh random tree and"
1856800,1862080," in the file maybe we can put some random text as well who knows and the random text could be"
1862080,1869920," random combination of different words and whatnot maybe we can have maybe we can take like a simple markov"
1869920,1876480," model uh maybe find it somewhere online and we can generate sentences and what not"
1876480,1890800," lauren ipsum maybe we'll see let's see how it goes"
1890800,1909440," that's actually a pretty cool exercise i think i think this is a pretty cool exercise for your brain muscle"
1911520,1934640," um okay making cup of tea lol all right making cup of tea"
1937280,1964880," what's up kids hello"
1964880,1969920," um"
1969920,1980480," so we have that and um i don't know can i just create yeah i want you to create a folder"
1980480,1989680," so it's going to be fs create folder right directory and this is going to be do i accept i have to accept a"
1989680,1997920," path yeah damn i have to accept a path and uh what kind of constructors do we have for the path let me"
1997920,2004800," see i can construct a path out of string type whatever is that supposed to mean um but i suppose"
2004800,2012320," string type like any string type a sister std string and all of that is fine i presume"
2012880,2018080," so maybe the way we're going to do that is a fast path and hope that it's going to work actually so it's"
2018080,2027040," going to be folder path um okay maybe something like created folder and we're going to just put it like this"
2029520,2036080," uh let me see uh let me see okay and it crashed undefined reference"
2036080,2044080," okay so i have to link this with something um i wonder what i have to link it with"
2052560,2064000," c++ file system um undefined reference so i have to probably link it with something uh oh yeah i"
2064000,2075200," fucking remember that yes i fucking remember that i just yes i have such an old compiler that it is"
2075200,2080000," still a thing holy fucking shit yes yes yes it's a debian stamp"
2080000,2088160," i do remember that like i was trying to build one of your projects and uh i had to do that"
2090080,2103040," fuck fuck all right"
2120080,2134480," yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah expose myself as a boomer programmer"
2134480,2143840," coding in the 90s okay"
2146560,2150400," doesn't work now because i never actually used it um"
2150400,2163440," created folder data i can actually create it how many times to once"
2163440,2169840," uh what the fuck is going emacs stop stop emacs"
2172560,2180640," okay so let me remove that and yeah so i want to try to create something like your mom"
2180640,2185760," and as you can see your mom is here"
2185760,2193520," there we go seems to be working seems to be twerking so the idea now is the following"
2196240,2202720," uh we want to do uh generate a tree right so we're going to accept generate the tree"
2202720,2209600," uh and in here we're going to accept the path uh from which you want to generate so"
2209600,2215200," this is going to be something like this it's going to be const uh root"
2215200,2223520," and here we need to generate like a random number uh how many entries we want to generate"
2223520,2231600," how many entries we want to generate so in c plus plus as far as i know there is like a subsystem for"
2231600,2240080," random number generation um c plus plus uh 17 random numbers let's actually learn how to use"
2240080,2252400," another student number random generator is there an example so there's a lot of different distribution"
2252400,2255600," okay uh okay we need to include the random"
2255600,2266480," we need to create a random device with a particular distribution and so this is going to be uniform"
2266480,2273760," distribution from okay let me create a separate uh entry in here because it looks like it's going to be"
2273760,2274320," very useful"
2274320,2286960," oh yeah thank you for reminding me uh i need to add the link to the thing i'm doing right now"
2288240,2304720," it's in the project inverting file tree in c plus plus source uh maybe i'm going to just uh give the"
2304720,2311680," link to here right so for more information on what exactly i'm doing uh just look at that repo okay so i"
2311680,2318000," actually put as much information as i could exp trying to explain what it's all about right so we're"
2318000,2324080," inverting by like file system tree as like inverting binary tree and all that is an exercise to learn about"
2324080,2330800," std file system right so yeah um let me see"
2332800,2338640," so we need to create a default random engine and then uniform distribution"
2338640,2345520," uh okay std random device whatever that's supposed to be random device"
2345520,2356240," uh okay uh then we're going to use uniform distribution for integers uniform distribution"
2358080,2363040," uniform int distribution what's the point of calling it in distribution if you have to"
2363040,2367280," parameterize it with int do they do them in any kind of integer value"
2367280,2375280," um okay int type so it could be size t it could be like long long or something like any integer"
2375280,2380160," and so it's it's not going to work for continuous types like floats i see i see what you what i mean"
2381120,2387040," i see what i mean uh all right so this is going to be uniform int distribution and it's going to be"
2387040,2394640," int uh and it's going to be uniform dist from one to six and i suppose it's not going to generate"
2394640,2400880," anything but this specific number um randomly chosen mean"
2403680,2408160," so if i just like generate like a couple of times so it's going to be integer from zero to"
2408160,2416000," like 10 right let me try to do something like stdc out um so what do we do"
2416000,2422800," default random and then choose random mean between one and six"
2422800,2433040," oh this is really complicated why to generate a random stuff we have to have so many parameters in here"
2433040,2439440," you have to create a random device then distribution and engine so to generate"
2439440,2445840," random numbers you have to manipulate three different entities device distribution and engine like okay"
2445840,2455680," without the engine okay uh because it's kind of strange i think i already was looking at it"
2459040,2461040," okay"
2461040,2469200," uh but is it is isn't this an engine isn't this an engine alba what's up what's up what's up"
2469200,2473760," already in oh we've got a raid from provot hello hello everyone"
2473760,2483520," hello so we're doing something weird today we're doing something weird and kinky uh we are inverting file"
2483520,2491600," tree that's what we do please don't judge there's more information in in the repo itself but the idea"
2491600,2497920," is that you know the classical exercise of inverting binary tree and shit like that we're doing the same"
2497920,2504080," but on the file system so we have a file system tree and we're going to write a program using std file"
2504080,2512160," system that inverts the file system so yeah and all of that is just a means of exercise to exercise usage of"
2512160,2517920," std file system uh yeah but the first thing we're trying to do we're trying to generate a random"
2517920,2525600," file tree so we can invert it so and all of that is just recreational programming there is no any purpose"
2525600,2532400," it's just for recreational yeah for a creation program i don't know i don't know how to explain that"
2533680,2539840," don't judge i like this kind of shit what can i say i'm a weird person"
2539840,2549840," all right this is why i'm unemployed by the way because instead of doing something useful for the"
2549840,2554560," humanity i end up doing this kind of which is absolutely fucking useless"
2556560,2557760," uh yeah"
2557760,2561520," all right"
2561520,2566480," i haven't worked with like a proper c plus plus in in years"
2566480,2572880," doesn't deserve anything useful well"
2572880,2576960," i don't know at least something useful for myself"
2578400,2582160," um but sometimes i feel like i don't deserve anything useful either"
2582160,2588880," anyway so what is this it's it still uses engine here's the thing it still uses engine it's just"
2588880,2593920," like it's called differently does it is it not i think i think it's still called differently you need"
2593920,2602080," a device you need an engine you need a distribution oh it's less characters i see okay"
2606400,2612000," you're living the life and no not yet at least um okay"
2612000,2624560," the reverse fs tree every day this software will be helpful for me sure sure buddy uh okay"
2624560,2631760," uh so here's device and default uh random thing what's interesting is that you have to call a random"
2631760,2644000," device as a function who designed this thing why like i'm not mad i'm not disappointed i just i just"
2644000,2649600," want to understand the person i just want to talk to them you know maybe they have a problem in their"
2649600,2655360," life or something like it's just like yeah just want to come to them and it's just like do you want to"
2655360,2660240," talk about it like is is everything okay um i don't know"
2665040,2673040," maybe not trivial cause that you don't want to put in a contractor opening the front of them yeah"
2673040,2678640," yeah it's true it could be"
2685600,2690000," all right all right so let me see can i now uh just use"
2690000,2700320," ah and then i keep it as an engine all right let's let's do it like this so it's going to be rd"
2701120,2716880," uh 37 um so this is again uh"
2716880,2724480," so this is an engine oh my god i'm it's really confusing"
2725600,2729520," uh uh uniform in distribution okay"
2729520,2738960," uniform int this tree uh distribution"
2738960,2747600," just trip one six"
2750000,2759680," um um um uh i need it"
2775680,2777840," okay okay so"
2777840,2779680," all right"
2779680,2786480," random device engine distribution"
2786480,2792720," ah i see"
2792720,2798480," i see"
2798480,2805600," random device is essentially like def random but depending on operating system"
2805600,2809200," it could be something is something different like it's it's like basically"
2809200,2815120," hardware representation of something that can generate random numbers the engine is the thing"
2815120,2824560," that uses random device to generate numbers and given a distribution right it can generate"
2824560,2827440," numbers using random device with a certain distribution"
2830000,2830640," um"
2830640,2830720," um"
2830720,2836160," i'm not sure if i'm happy with this kind of approach but okay"
2836160,2837440," um"
2837440,2841840," maybe i don't want to use it actually"
2841840,2844480," seriously i don't want to use it"
2844480,2848960," um so because i i don't need to like it feels like"
2848960,2854480," this is needed for a very specific like simulation you you you have like um"
2855920,2857040," like very specific"
2857040,2863440," like very specific uh physics simulation that require very specific distribution with a very specific like"
2863440,2869120," performance or something right and because of that you have like a huge variety of different"
2869120,2875120," distributions engines and stuff like that and you hand pick carefully what exactly you want for your"
2875120,2881200," simulation is just and then you run the simulation it's just yes it's perfect but we're not doing that"
2882080,2888640," you see what i mean like we're not doing that so in that case all this stuff is kind of justified"
2888640,2895760," okay i can understand that but we don't need that so because of that i'm gonna just use a cstd leap"
2895760,2903120," okay uh thank you very much um thank you very much i don't want to use all of that"
2905440,2920320," uh okay so uh maybe i can seat uh this thing somewhere here"
2920320,2929920," it's random uh time and probably probably also need a time uh main two"
2933600,2940400," okay so it doesn't come uh okay so another one i think it has to be also uh c time"
2940400,2947920," uh yes yes yes yes yes okay why this one i forgot sorry just a second"
2947920,2955680," uh i think time should accept zero or something or no ptr i think it accepts no ptr doesn't it"
2957040,2969120," yeah okay the only thing i want to do i want to just generate a particular number from so something"
2969120,2978880," like rand int range and let's generate numbers from two to uh five maybe two to four all right so let's"
2978880,2986720," let's implement this function run the int range this one is going to low and this one is going to high"
2986720,2995760," and essentially we need to find the distance between uh high and low um so if i have one to three right"
2995760,3000160," the distance is three but if i subtract three from one it's going to be two so it means i need to add one"
3000160,3007680," so it's going to be high minus low plus one right so i'm generating numbers from zero up until there"
3007680,3016240," um like like this right and then i add that to low and there we go i can generate a particular range"
3017840,3023360," quite easily high random yes it's very high just like myself right now"
3023360,3031360," um i mean i'm high on t i don't i don't consume anything illegal"
3031360,3043440," all right uh so now i want to generate like n entries all right we're we're going to generate an"
3043440,3048880," entries and for each individual entry right zero to n"
3048880,3062800," yeah uh zero to n is going to be a plus plus i and what we want to do we want to actually create a"
3062800,3067920," bunch of files to create a bunch of files we need to know how to extend or concatenate the path can i"
3067920,3074240," extend the path uh so i can provide path can it provide"
3074240,3077040," uh-huh"
3077040,3078640," ah"
3078640,3085120," i think i know so because as jean said"
3085120,3093360," right it already overloads the slash operator that means i can do something like create"
3094080,3102640," directory root slash uh and then i need to maybe convert integer to string i forgot how to convert"
3102640,3107920," integer to string c++ i think there was like something to string in c++ just a second"
3107920,3113200," yes yes yes yes yes yes yeah yeah yeah to string"
3116560,3126000," to string uh is it gonna search it okay uh std to string okay"
3126000,3137440," std to string i and you can create a directory but can you create the file i guess we can just create"
3137440,3143200," a uh create a directory for now and just see what's going to happen um can i do something like this now"
3143200,3153040," where i could do const auto um child child path and it's going to be something like"
3153040,3155600," child path"
3160800,3171680," there we go"
3171680,3180640," okay um all right so let me see what's going to happen uh-huh so it created your mom but it didn't"
3180640,3191440," create anything else okay uh oh i forgot to call generate tree yes um"
3191440,3196480," generate tree and it's going to be folder path okay"
3196480,3205920," uh all right so it created your mom zero and your mom one perfect uh uh"
3205920,3215920," uh yeah you've created all of them so we already have the foundation for like random generation of"
3215920,3217280," those things i think it's very cool"
3217280,3225360," so can i create a file is there any way to just create a file um"
3228320,3242560," so create uh create a directory create a file well i can always create a file with the if stream i"
3242560,3254880," presume um so is there something like a touch a file now i guess i can create it you can just open the"
3254880,3259760," file and just close it like with if stream if you know what i mean so that's the way to create a file"
3259760,3262400," um but yeah okay"
3262400,3270240," generator generator heater"
3270240,3277760," let's create something like this is going to be void create a file fs path"
3278720,3286480," uh file path and here's the interesting question uh ironically doesn't deal with actually creating files"
3286480,3289600," uh all right"
3289600,3293440," if stream"
3293440,3296480," um"
3296480,3304960," i wonder if they updated f stream to accept path in the constructor i wonder if they did"
3308560,3314320," they would you look at that that's actually pretty cool uh that's actually pretty good and cool"
3314320,3324000," wait a second um why the are you not a vip there we go um okay"
3324000,3329520," so we should be able to do that uh std if stream"
3332800,3339600," you know what technically to create a file you can just do something like if stream right because it"
3339600,3346160," will create a temporary file that will die that will be closed after i it goes out of the scope"
3346160,3349120," thank you for removing uber frontage"
3349120,3354400," you could have just asked me for okay"
3355760,3360800," you you didn't have to actually suffer the entire time because i've just said something"
3360800,3367440," um all right i don't know hands up"
3367440,3370080," is better"
3375200,3378080," so and because of that i think we don't need to create the file thingy"
3378080,3384000," um okay so let's do the following thing if rand"
3386320,3392000," two right it's going to be from zero to one uh hit enter okay"
3392000,3401600," created folder"
3401600,3407280," folder otherwise we're going to do credit file"
3413840,3416800," std if stream um and"
3416800,3420800," child path"
3420800,3425600," okay so let's see if it's going to work or not i actually want to make the"
3425600,3432000," thing a little bit bigger for example from 10 to 15 so there's more chance to actually create either"
3432000,3442240," folder or a folder or a file"
3442240,3443520," okay so"
3443520,3451440," and oh"
3451440,3452800," fuck okay"
3452800,3456960," uh unnecessary parentheses around child path"
3462800,3475520," that is very interesting"
3475520,3484000," variable"
3488000,3489040," ah i'm gonna just"
3489040,3490080," cut"
3490080,3493200," uh if stream"
3493200,3496800," is it is that what you want it's f stream"
3496800,3497760," isn't it"
3497760,3504240," yes yes yes okay"
3504240,3506960," oh"
3506960,3507200," fuck"
3507200,3509840," you just skip them"
3512240,3513280," uh"
3513280,3514080," i just skip them"
3514080,3521840," uh"
3521840,3522880," all right thank you so much"
3522880,3526320," thank you so much"
3526320,3530240," because i already was looking at my obs thinking that maybe there's something wrong with the stream"
3530240,3533440," okay this didn't work um"
3534240,3537680," it has to be off stream oh my god"
3537680,3538880," oh my god"
3538880,3539920," okay"
3539920,3542080," one more time"
3542080,3544160," all right"
3544160,3546080," so if i go here"
3546080,3548000," now we're talking"
3548000,3551680," you see some of them are files some of them are folders"
3555840,3556400," cool"
3556400,3556400," cool"
3556400,3557520," so i'm gonna remove your mom"
3557520,3562960," don't worry chat"
3562960,3566240," soon we're gonna be recursively traversing your mom"
3566240,3568080," sorry"
3568080,3571040," so this is gonna be"
3571040,3572560," can i do something like this by the way"
3572560,3577360," i think i should be able to"
3577360,3580320," and this is a parenthesis in declaration of child path"
3580320,3582800," this is really strange i like um"
3582800,3585120," is that a bug of gcc"
3585120,3591600," okay i think it could be a bug"
3591600,3592560," yeah"
3592560,3599680," it's a feature i see i don't know much of c plus plus so"
3599680,3604960," but i presume"
3604960,3608960," that that's how it works"
3610320,3615600," all right"
3615600,3618400," and my main idea after we implemented all that"
3618400,3618640," right"
3618640,3620240," is that"
3620240,3624800," it's going to be something like from two to six"
3624800,3625840," if"
3625840,3627760," this was"
3627760,3629040," a folder"
3629040,3630000," right"
3630000,3630960," if this was a folder"
3630960,3632960," we keep generating"
3632960,3635280," the tree recursively"
3635280,3636560," so it's going to be child path"
3636560,3639200," and just go a little bit deeper"
3639920,3640960," just keep generating"
3640960,3642080," you see"
3642080,3644880," just keep generating"
3644880,3650480," so from time to time i accidentally saved my compilation buffer for some reason i don't know why but"
3650480,3657200," all right let's see what's going to happen if i generate your mom now but recursively oh"
3657200,3662480," that generated a lot of stuff"
3662480,3663360," i'm not going to lie"
3663360,3664080," i'm not going to lie"
3664080,3668480," wait a second"
3668480,3670400," that was weird"
3670400,3671280," um"
3671280,3675120," what if we generate like two to three"
3675120,3676560," right two to three"
3678640,3679680," almost killed fs"
3679680,3679680," i almost killed fs"
3679680,3680640," ah maybe"
3680640,3682160," i don't know"
3682160,3684320," what do you want from me"
3684320,3685120," what do you want from me"
3685120,3685360," okay"
3685360,3686080," um"
3686080,3687840," let's generate it"
3687840,3690080," okay"
3690080,3691760," um"
3691760,3696400," terminate"
3696400,3698720," cannot create folder"
3699360,3700560," ah because it was already"
3700560,3700880," ah because it was already"
3700880,3701120," okay"
3701120,3705200," so we need to precisely pick the constants"
3705200,3707200," yeah"
3707200,3714880," so what i'm thinking is that i think the probability"
3714880,3718240," uh the probability of this thing becoming"
3718240,3723360," a folder should be lower than the probability of the entry becoming a file"
3724000,3729520," so i think the problem is that it's 50 50 pretty much yeah"
3729520,3744560," and that's that's why it generates a pretty huge tree so and we can take a even take a look at"
3744560,3752400," what it generated uh so it basically generates like a dfs or something um the useful way to waste all"
3752400,3755840," i know exactly um so let me see"
3755840,3765440," can you add depth maybe we could add depth but i want uh this thing to end at like"
3765440,3772800," i want them to end with files you know that'd be cool"
3772800,3780880," all right we can add depth sure i think that's the easiest way to do to do that it's going to"
3780880,3787280," the size t depth uh and then we can have something like um you know size t depth"
3787280,3794960," depth capacity this is not how we spell depth depth capacity and let's say that you can go"
3794960,3806960," deeper than um than five i mean probably uh so generate the tree and this is going to be um"
3809120,3811920," depth plus one let's commit depth plus one let's commit depth plus one"
3811920,3820800," and if depth is greater or equal than the depth capacity the maximum depth capacity"
3820800,3824160," um actually has to be less than the depth capacity"
3824160,3828720," all right this is going to be like this"
3835760,3843680," okay okay and yeah so in that case we can actually generate like from 10 to 15 15."
3843680,3860720," okay that's still too much i think so maybe depth um okay five to eight"
3863200,3865120," so yeah now it has these files"
3865120,3874160," did i already destroy my file system"
3874160,3877280," oh"
3877280,3891600," apparently emacs when it deletes a folder tries to delete it themselves so essentially emacs itself tries to"
3891600,3896160," to traverse the file system and delete the files instead of like calling to um"
3896160,3903520," i mean there's no anything in the operating system that allow you to do that but anyway so"
3906800,3910320," uh all right so that's very interesting um"
3910320,3917360," um so it's going to be from five to"
3917360,3923840," three to five let's try three to five and maybe the depth capacity let's keep it like that then"
3926080,3935520," okay so that's a little bit more like you know variable i think so if i try to do tree your mom"
3935520,3942560," there we go so this is our tree uh monica live subscribe with twitch prime thank you thank you so"
3942560,3947600," much for two months of twitch prime subscription thank you thank you thank you and welcome to epic"
3947600,3952160," recursive club that's right epic recursive club"
3952160,3965920," all right so this looks okay i really like that it actually shows like a tree so it would be pretty"
3965920,3970720," clear clear that the tree has been reversed or something so i can do something like your mom"
3970720,3984640," and there we go um okay so this is a tree uh okay uh let me see let me see um it it's kind of boring i think"
3986880,3989200," um"
3989200,3998880," it's kind of boring that uh they are just numbers it would be kind of cool if they were like very specific"
3998880,4005600," words uh and uh maybe even random words yeah just different random words"
4010480,4020720," uh um text file list of fruits can we have something like this like a list of fruits fruits txt"
4020720,4033920," uh yeah that's that's pretty cool i guess uh we can just use that essentially uh i can take that and i'm"
4033920,4039600," going to copy paste this entire thing um and maybe i'm going to query replace"
4040480,4047760," um you know what i'm going to do something like this um so they have spaces you know what i'm going"
4047760,4053120," to query replace and replace space with underscore uh so there's the star fruit"
4053120,4056800," it's interesting okay"
4056800,4065920," cucumber really cucumber"
4069360,4073760," well it is what it is cucumber is a fruit from now on"
4073760,4078320," uh so i want to put that um"
4078320,4087120," into a vector i suppose right so when i'm going to say with two fruits hpp"
4087120,4096240," right fruits hpp um and if not defined fruits hpp"
4097120,4099600," uh you know you know it you know"
4099600,4105280," and if uh fruits hpp"
4105280,4111440," uh you know it you know"
4111440,4124240," do already for the string std vector std string uh fruits uh and we're gonna put it like that i think that should work"
4125840,4126320," yeah"
4126320,4136080," isn't it cool isn't it cool i think it's goddamn cool uh maybe it would make sense to actually put it into"
4136080,4144720," fruits cpp fruits cpp i'm gonna include uh fruits hpp so and this one is going to be just external declaration"
4144720,4153440," right so this is external you know what you know what you know what we might as well actually"
4153440,4160000," completely move it inside and say something like static and it's not going to be visible outside and we're"
4160000,4164160," so we're only going to have something like uh random fruit"
4164160,4167040," random fruits"
4169040,4180240," uh random fruit um and you don't need a vector in here you only need a string and this is going to be like a separate module"
4181680,4184160," uh"
4184160,4188000," okay so we're going to return here is fruits uh rand"
4188000,4197280," fruits is it size i forgot i think it's size um yeah so and because of that we also need to do c std"
4197280,4204720," delete okay so we have a module that can generate random fruits for us or at least random names for fruits"
4204720,4211440," and whatnot so that's pretty convenient um okay so i'm gonna go in here um"
4214080,4224080," so it's gonna be fruits fruits cpp and fruits hpp uh generator"
4224080,4230240," so and let's include the header fruits"
4230240,4239680," okay let's generate this one more time uh maybe i need to first"
4244080,4244880," remove your mom"
4244880,4250080," and um what am i doing"
4250080,4254320," yeah just wanted to run this"
4254320,4262400," okay cool uh everything compiles so in the generator now"
4262400,4272880," what i want to do um i suppose every time we're gonna choose a random prefix right so it's going to be a"
4273440,4279040," prefix maybe child prefix and it's going to be a random fruit"
4279040,4281440," random fruit"
4281440,4285840," so it's going to be child path"
4285840,4291600," random fruit and here i presume i can do something like"
4291600,4295280," child prefix plus"
4295280,4302080," dash plus that to be fair i can just do something like random fruit"
4303360,4307760," yeah like this so this is going to be child path we take a root and then we can continue these two"
4307760,4311120," things together and there we go here is the random fruit"
4311120,4311920," um"
4311920,4317280," all right so let me try to recompile this into a step"
4317280,4319920," uh and"
4319920,4323200," okay"
4323200,4329040," that actually didn't generate that much sometimes i suppose it generates doesn't generate too many things"
4329680,4334800," one more time so i want a little bit bigger file system there we go so"
4334800,4341440," okay that's that's pretty cool so this is what we have damn"
4341440,4341760," son"
4341760,4346640," wait is that a fruit"
4348880,4349440," wait what"
4349440,4349440," wait what"
4349440,4354240," damn son what'd you find out"
4354240,4369440," oh this is the creator of c plus plus look this is the creator of c plus plus i knew it"
4370800,4371760," um"
4371760,4374480," i mean so kind of kind of i suppose"
4374480,4377520," um coconut"
4377520,4379760," gooseberry"
4379760,4385600," really is that what it is polish i didn't know that it's"
4385600,4390880," wow it makes it easy to remember"
4391520,4395360," actually um it actually makes it easy to remember"
4395360,4401040," um okay maybe i also like want to generate the content for a file"
4401040,4403680," um somehow"
4403680,4406000," yeah maybe"
4406000,4412640," let me try it oh it actually makes it super easy to generate the content for a file because we have a file"
4412640,4421360," in here and i can um just generate a bunch of words right so i can do something like m rand int"
4421360,4430480," range and let's generate like from 20 to 30 words and i'm gonna do something like words"
4430480,4440160," count uh and it's gonna be word zero words uh words count i mean you can always do something like this"
4440880,4442240," while"
4442240,4442640," all right"
4442640,4445760," like this"
4445760,4447280," uh f"
4447280,4448800," f out"
4448800,4451920," is going to be a random fruit"
4451920,4454320," uh separated by space"
4454320,4457360," maybe separated by a new line why not"
4457360,4459920," so we're going to just keep generating random fruits in here"
4459920,4462560," and as it goes outside of this scope"
4462560,4466000," and this object get destroyed it will be automatically closed"
4466000,4469920," okay so this is the way we can generate like random content for the files"
4470720,4473920," sort of um sort of random"
4473920,4479360," okay"
4479360,4480960," so"
4480960,4484000," damn son"
4484000,4486720," oh it's not gonna work"
4486720,4488560," all right it kind of worked"
4488560,4492960," all right so kiwi fruit and here it contains more different fruits"
4492960,4500080," uh yep yep yep so we're just generating random random data that's essentially what we're doing oh by"
4500080,4504560," the way i think i need to credit the source of this thing um yeah"
4504560,4514400," oh and this is like an example that loads the words i mean i just baked it into the source code"
4514400,4519840," you don't need to load file if the data is baked into the source code don't even worry about that"
4519840,4522640," uh generator hater"
4523600,4533040," okay so fruit uh fruit fruit cpp created the nature i mean i'm pretty sure nature didn't come"
4533040,4535440," out with the names for the fruits uh so"
4535440,4544160," uh but i mean technically did because nature created us we created the language and it just depends on the"
4544160,4546480," definition of the definition this yet another definition game"
4546480,4551840," okay"
4551840,4556960," ugly fruit"
4560400,4570720," okay all right okay so i'm gonna remove this thing yes yes yes yes"
4570720,4576480," emacs asks too many questions okay"
4581280,4583200," oh yeah and i want you to take a look at the tree"
4583200,4586800," yeah let's generate one more time"
4586800,4594480," oh my god look look at that look at that file tree isn't it beautiful"
4594480,4598800," isn't it i think it's beautiful absolutely beautiful look at that"
4598800,4602720," yes this is a tree and this is like quite good looking train"
4603440,4608400," um yeah we can reverse that i can reverse that"
4608400,4610240," oh wow"
4610240,4616880," so we implemented the generator"
4616880,4627120," random smoothie recipe generator yeah that's what it is uh okay so let me actually stash this entire"
4627120,4628240," site um"
4628240,4636480," implement the um file tree"
4636480,4640640," generator and i'm gonna push that right into the repo"
4640640,4642480," cool"
4652480,4656160," hmm so we have an inverter now"
4656160,4669760," so i'm gonna steal some code from the generator specifically the ones that handle um you know"
4669760,4675280," the command line arguments and whatnot so usage in here yeah"
4675280,4677280," it's gonna do like this"
4681200,4682800," inverter"
4682800,4683440," folder path"
4683440,4698000," folder path is not provided so what do we have in here we need to include o string and don't"
4698000,4703200," remember if i have to include that but we'll see so i don't need a random number generator in here"
4704480,4714400," and also this is the folder path this is the folder path and i guess we just have to do invert"
4715600,4720480," folder uh folder uh folder path that's it and invert folder"
4720480,4725280," is going to be just something that accepts"
4725280,4726320," path"
4726320,4734000," uh root and this has to be like a const thingy"
4734000,4736080," i'm gonna invert my local music library with this too"
4736080,4744720," all right um but keep in mind that it also will invert the contents of the files so essentially here's"
4744720,4752800," the idea you have a folder uh right and you have two files full and bar so it inverts also the code it will"
4752800,4757760," swap the contents of this file so if you have a music library like the"
4759120,4765200," all the songs and their names are gonna be mixed up now uh at least that's the idea yeah more music"
4765200,4774720," okay"
4774720,4779520," invert a folder invert a folder"
4785040,4787280," reverse"
4787280,4800000," it's kind of getting out of okay i will i will keep that i will keep that in mind i'm going to put it"
4800000,4808000," on the back burner because that's a completely separate algorithm on its own right it's a completely"
4808000,4811040," separate algorithm on its own so first i want to just do"
4813120,4815920," the regular like folder stuff and then we'll see how it goes"
4815920,4827680," file uh becomes the folder name in the folder because yeah essentially if you have this as a"
4827680,4834880," folder right so this will become a folder and this will become file right so essentially the"
4834880,4840880," reverseage happens on the level of renaming we're reversing them by renaming them"
4842720,4848560," uh but the question says like it just depends on the order it just depends on the order i think we"
4848560,4855520," we have to enforce some sort of like a lexic lexicographical uh order bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye see"
4855520,4856240," you see you tomorrow"
4856240,4868000," all right good night good night time to sleep uh it's pretty late for you actually we're pretty much in the same"
4868000,4874160," time zone so yeah it's also late for me i should be sleeping too but i cannot because my life is"
4874160,4883840," up uh anyway what i want to do yeah we need to enforce some sort of order and the order is going"
4883840,4889520," to be a lexicographical one which means that we will have to sort the entries and whatnot um"
4890480,4896960," so so here's the file system and let me see what we've got"
4896960,4909920," std file system okay cpp reference i'm running out of energy so i think we'll i will have to make a small"
4909920,4922000," break to brew a cup of tea file system file system and the thing i want to do given a path"
4922000,4928640," give me all of the files is it possible to do something like that so there is a directory iterator"
4928640,4933760," an iterator of the contents of the directory perfect this is what i want give me that how do i use this"
4933760,4943280," uh okay so you just do fs directory iterator on a particular path i presume so does it accept uh what"
4943280,4950560," does it accept as a constructor let's see uh it accepts a file path it also accepts i suppose string"
4950560,4955920," or maybe i mean it's it's uh it only needs to accept file path because maybe it has implicit"
4955920,4961520," constructor from a string and yeah you know it's a c plus plus it makes uh you know your life easier"
4961520,4971920," it's supposed to at least um okay so let me go to the generator in space and i'm going to just put this"
4971920,4985840," thing in here uh bloat file system yes classic uh i think i'm looking at the wrong thing"
4985920,5010960," yes um fs directory iterator iterator uh for uh outer p for outer p i want to just do stdc out p"
5013360,5018480," and p stands for"
5018480,5027520," i remember i remember watching cachet stream when he was developing his uh text editor and he had a"
5027520,5036320," a full folder variable that is called mouse p and he was talking about his code to him to himself you"
5036320,5042160," know the usual programming stuff and he was constantly talking the same thing like mouse p mouse p"
5043600,5047920," and my brain like was it was constantly imagining that process and it's just like"
5049040,5056720," all right"
5056720,5071040," all right so uh yeah okay uh oh i'm all right i was supposed to be using an inverter inverter"
5071040,5082320," inverter inverter inverter inverter and okay so everything does not compile also it can be file system"
5084320,5090160," uh uh yeah i think it's true i think he's doing that intentionally"
5090160,5102560," he's a genius of post irony um all right okay so here they are essentially um file paths"
5104560,5117360," file paths uh we can try to sort them somehow right if we're gonna yeah um so it's gonna be inverter"
5121200,5131600," std vector uh std vector uh and what i'm gonna put in the fs uh path uh ps right so p s and here i'm"
5131600,5139280," going to do ps push back p right and i'm pretty sure there is like a way to do that in a very smarty"
5139280,5146880," pants way essentially like uh use an inserter um iterator and insert it into vector but i mean come on i just"
5146880,5152800," don't want to do that um yeah we're gonna do a std sort of course we're gonna do a std sort and for"
5152800,5160160," std sort uh i'm gonna just do algorithms um yeah we need algorithms in here is there any way to just"
5160160,5166800," print the whole vector uh is that a thing you can do in the modern c plus plus because remember it was"
5166800,5171680," not possible before yeah yeah back inserter yeah i don't remember that you can use a back inserter in"
5171680,5176480," here and just i think do something like std copy and every time you copy it will insert a new thing"
5176480,5186320," and just come on just try the code come on um all right so it doesn't work uh-huh"
5186320,5195600," there's so much smaller stuff in c++ how do i think back inserter is not even that modern thing"
5195600,5204960," i think i was using back inserter back in c++03 base uh so yeah um it's not even that one i think"
5206080,5213680," uh okay so this one is going to be just ps and uh we're going to be just printing this i think"
5213680,5223840," uh-huh and after that i want to do std sort and it's going to ps begin and see with classes and don't"
5223840,5231040," really understand you yeah me too so i usually always program in c with classes uh but today the topic of"
5231040,5237520," today's stream is to learn std file system that's why i'm doing like modern c++ stuff it's not even that"
5237520,5250640," modern but anyway um i personally prefer like a pure c uh over even c with classes c with glasses"
5251520,5256640," um okay okay all right i think that's a pretty good order um okay so let me put it like that"
5256640,5260560," a c joke yeah"
5261120,5268880," i'm going to cut it like that uh and don't and uh after that i suppose we want to just"
5268880,5272240," see what's going to happen see with glasses"
5275040,5281520," um okay all right okay all right i think that's a pretty good order"
5281520,5291120," um so what i'm thinking is i'm thinking is i guess first i'm trying to"
5291120,5311040," sort all of that then i'm going to go into all of the folders and reverse them yes that's going to be my"
5311040,5323920," plan um"
5323920,5336560," so here's the ps and then uh we're sorting this entire thing and uh after that i need a way to know if"
5336560,5345120," something is a folder or not uh let me see let me see is there something like is there must be i swear"
5345120,5350240," to god there must be something for this kind of stuff file system"
5359920,5362240," is is yeah this is what i was talking about"
5362240,5382720," um so for const auto p p s uh if fs is directory if fs is directory we are doing uh invert folder"
5382720,5389680," okay uh for that thing uh maybe i should actually call them something like children so this is a"
5389680,5395200," the children this is a child we push the child then we sort the children"
5395200,5402480," child children"
5402480,5405440," child"
5405440,5416080," after we inverted everything after we inverted everything i think time has come to do the um"
5417600,5423440," the inversion algorithm so uh the reverse algorithm um this one is going to be interesting because"
5423440,5429840," we have to rename things right so essentially have a bunch of files and what we need to do you need"
5429840,5438960," to rename this file to this one and this one this file to this one so essentially uh we need to rename"
5438960,5446320," a to intermediate thing a to intermediate thing to a and intermediate thing back to d"
5446320,5448320," you see"
5448320,5456400," and then repeat for this pair in here and until you basically reversed all these things"
5456400,5460240," so that's going to be the idea essentially here"
5461920,5462480," mapping mapping"
5462480,5464640," let's give it a try"
5464640,5472720," it's a classical uh reverse array algorithm but instead of array you have files"
5472720,5478320," you see what i mean instead of array you have files and we also need to come up with like unique"
5478320,5479440," um"
5479440,5487440," unique intermediate name as well so it's going to be interesting maybe unique intermediate name could be a"
5487440,5495120," concatenation of the name of the files plus some sort of a like a random thingy um or maybe i don't know"
5495120,5502000," it's kind of interesting so what you would rename it to maybe it could be a temporary file um"
5502000,5505920," yeah we can request an operating system to have a temporary file"
5505920,5509440," right and we can rename this thing to that file"
5510320,5513520," and then rename it back so yeah it could be something like this actually"
5513520,5520080," okay so"
5520080,5530320," tempi file um size team zero uh and it's going to be actually uh children"
5530320,5538080," size half of the size plus time so um and essentially the path that we need to swap"
5538800,5545920," it's going to const out of a children i and the second one that you want to swap is going to be"
5545920,5556000," children i um children um children's size minus i minus one so we are reversing like by player"
5556000,5566320," moving to the center you see the classical reverse uh reverse array algorithm um so c plus plus temp file"
5568160,5575840," uh yeah there's a little temp file okay and it's uh"
5575840,5583440," uh temp directory path okay cool"
5583440,5593120," don't uh temp is that everything i have in a modern c plus plus"
5595360,5595760," really"
5595760,5600640," and tmp file is"
5600640,5611200," i need a cup of tea"
5616240,5619920," yeah yeah yeah team phil is something from c all right god damn all right"
5619920,5629040," why is this is a half this is such a half-ass solution could you just give me like"
5629040,5634000," oh wait it returns a path"
5634000,5639040," uh a director is suitable for temporary files"
5643520,5650480," well yeah okay we can we can see uh juicy c++ failed to do that yeah"
5650480,5656800," wait a second can i just see what it returns i just want to see what it returns"
5657440,5675840," inter main std cout profess temp directory path wait what the fuck is this shit the fuck is this"
5675840,5683360," disgusting uh oh maybe there is a reason to i don't remember i think i think i think you're"
5683360,5693280," supposed to do and all right for cross platform think uh and all is slow already does it have a like"
5693280,5706720," runtime cost why would it have a runtime cost that's really strange um okay um it has flash fog okay"
5710640,5719680," so just give us tmp but you know you may never know um yeah this is not particularly useful"
5719680,5724640," because you still have to generate like a unique file name yourself"
5725360,5731440," so uh thank you c plus plus really cool i suppose"
5731440,5735600," all right"
5742000,5757360," i guess we can have a temporary file uh tmp name okay tmp num nam nam let's get the damn nam spam"
5757360,5769760," uh okay creates a unique file name that does not name the currently existing file okay so that's pretty"
5769760,5780640," cool cool i didn't return the uh i see uh temporary file name uh tmp nam"
5780640,5785680," main std"
5785680,5788720," tmp nam"
5790880,5797840," oh oh do i have to include some stuff as std io um let's see std"
5797840,5806320," it has to be no ptr right there's something like no ptr"
5806320,5809840," is it gonna work is it gonna work yo"
5811280,5817520," um the use of tmp nam is dangerous better use makes temp"
5817520,5826560," okay so wait"
5826560,5834880," it's is this a linker error"
5840480,5849280," the linker warned me about unsafe not the compiler the linker if i understand this is really strange"
5849280,5852560," like i've never seen that before i mean"
5852560,5859200," usually it's the compiler who actually warns about this kind of but linker really"
5859200,5868400," uh oh yeah so yeah it's a possex i mean if if i'm gonna use possex functions i might as well not use"
5868880,5875200," std file system and just use possex to traverse through the files and stuff like that so it's kind"
5875200,5876640," of defeats the point"
5876640,5879280," yeah"
5879280,5882560," yeah so if i have possex why the f do i need a std file system"
5882560,5898800," yeah open dear read oh yeah have you seen my library uh called mini-rent yeah yeah it's actually super cool"
5903520,5910320," so just a second mini-rent it's basically a small subset of dear rent for windows"
5910320,5919840," uh so essentially uh it supports uh open dear and read dear and close dear and it's a single header"
5919840,5927200," library just a single header and it works on uh windows so essentially if you have a possex code"
5927200,5932160," it's it's a very small library by the way it just wraps a couple of uh win api calls if you have a"
5932160,5937760," code that depends on open uh dear read dear and close dear uh and it works with this library it will"
5937760,5944240," work on linux and on windows and it's just a single header uh so yeah and i use it in a couple of my games"
5944240,5954800," so this is actually pretty cool um yeah so i think it doesn't report errors properly yeah i think uh"
5954800,5961760," dear and is supposed to set error null uh accordingly and i was just too lazy to translate the results of"
5961760,5968720," get error in win api to ever know things for possex and i i put a couple of to do's in there but yeah um"
5971920,5980240," so anyway now uh all right so i think we need to make a small break yes yes yes yes uh do you guys"
5980240,5995760," want to listen to some music while we're just doing um so uh okay okay you guys want to listen to country"
5995760,6000880," okay let's listen to some country"
6000880,6008560," it doesn't really sound to kakona we need something more kakona"
6008560,6012400," hey come on"
6018640,6019440," i'm disappointed"
6019440,6024160," yeah i think i think it's good enough"
6024160,6043360," all right let's make a small break let's make a small break you guys have fun"
6043360,6055520," um"
6055520,6055520," so"
6055520,6067680," so"

6140640,6152800," you"
6152800,6152800," so"
6152800,6164960," you"
6164960,6164960," so"
6164960,6164960," you"
6164960,6177120," do"
6177120,6177120," so"
6177120,6177120," you"
6177120,6177120," so"
6177120,6177120," you"
6177120,6189280," you"
6189280,6189280," you"
6189280,6201440," you"
6201440,6203440," so"
6203440,6203440," you"
6203440,6203440," you"
6203440,6203440," you"
6203440,6205440," you"
6205440,6205440," you"
6205440,6219600," this music is"
6219600,6219600," you"
6219600,6220320," uh"
6220320,6220960," oh"
6220960,6221760," oh boy"
6221760,6221760," so"
6221760,6221840," oh boy"
6221840,6222240," so"
6222240,6222880," root"
6222880,6224480," right"
6224480,6227920," we need to pick a free file name"
6227920,6228960," right"
6228960,6230720," free file name"
6230720,6232000," so"
6232000,6232880," let's do something like this"
6232880,6234000," we're going to return a free"
6234000,6237520," free file name"
6237520,6238400," we're going to accept"
6238400,6239920," fs path"
6239920,6241120," root"
6242000,6243200," and it's going to return us"
6243200,6243680," and it's going to return us like"
6243680,6245520," something based on that"
6245520,6245840," um"
6245840,6248400," okay"
6248400,6250320," now"
6250320,6252240," uh"
6252240,6254720," it's going to be something like"
6254720,6255440," const"
6255440,6256000," not char"
6256000,6257040," but fs path"
6257040,6259200," uh"
6259200,6260960," tmp file name"
6260960,6262320," uh"
6262320,6263120," free"
6263120,6264080," file name"
6264080,6265760," root"
6265760,6266000," right"
6266000,6267200," so"
6267200,6269520," and we're going to use that tmp file name"
6269520,6271360," for all of our shenanigans"
6271360,6273840," okay"
6273840,6274240," so"
6274240,6275520," and essentially the way it's going to work"
6275520,6277280," i think we're going to include the fruits"
6277280,6278720," and we're going to use the for"
6278720,6279040," um"
6279040,6281760," maybe"
6281760,6284160," i'm going to do the following thing"
6284160,6285280," um"
6285280,6289200," so"
6289200,6290240," is directory"
6290240,6292800," file system"
6292800,6295360," i cannot for some reason do the file system thing"
6295360,6295680," you can"
6295680,6296160," oh i can"
6296160,6298160," exist"
6299760,6300080," yeah"
6300080,6300720," exists"
6300720,6302400," cool"
6302400,6304320," aha"
6304320,6305440," so"
6305440,6308160," we can have some sort of a counter"
6308160,6308560," right"
6308560,6310400," so it's going to counter starting from zero"
6310400,6311920," and"
6311920,6314640," while true"
6314640,6315680," which is very dangerous"
6315680,6317280," just a second"
6317280,6318400," i need to pour"
6318400,6319520," a cup of water"
6319520,6320080," for my team"
6320080,6321840," just a second"
6321840,6322560," just a second"
6329520,6343440," and back to back"
6343440,6348160," and back"
6348160,6348960," and back"
6348960,6350240," to back"
6350240,6357760," so"
6357760,6360880," if"
6360880,6366320," while"
6368000,6368560," fs"
6368560,6368560," fs"
6368560,6370400," exists"
6370400,6374400," and we're going to have something like root"
6374400,6381760," std string prefix is going to be"
6381760,6384560," let's put it as underscore"
6384560,6384960," i think"
6384960,6384960," i think"
6384960,6390800," it's going to be something like prefix"
6390800,6391760," plus"
6391760,6393600," two string"
6393600,6395200," counter"
6395200,6398160," while this thing exists"
6398160,6399440," while this thing exists"
6399440,6403840," we're going to increment the counter keep incrementing the counter"
6403840,6407440," if it doesn't exist"
6408320,6409680," we're going to just return it like that"
6409680,6415600," it's kind of like there's a little bit of duplication in this particular case"
6415600,6418640," sure how good of an idea that is"
6418640,6419280," but all right"
6420560,6423680," so let me see if this entire thing at least compiles"
6423680,6425920," let's see if it at least compiles"
6425920,6429280," uh start reference main okay"
6429280,6434240," okay it seems to be compiled"
6434240,6436080," so uh rename"
6436080,6442400," old new old new okay"
6450560,6452640," old p"
6452640,6454480," new p"
6454480,6458560," fs rename"
6458560,6459760," old p"
6459760,6463120," let's call it tmpp"
6463120,6467920," uh tmpp okay"
6467920,6474160," so"
6474160,6475920," old become"
6475920,6477520," tmp"
6479040,6479520," um"
6479520,6482560," i mean"
6482560,6483200," probably"
6483200,6492000," nice there's no like old and new it's still a yeah let's keep doing what i'm calling a"
6492000,6496240," a and b and this one is just tmp"
6496240,6502560," a becomes tmp then we're renaming b to a"
6502560,6508000," b to a and then we're renaming tmp"
6509040,6509440," to b"
6509440,6515760," did i make any mistake in this logic a becomes temporary b becomes a"
6515760,6523440," and temporary becomes b which was previously a okay so i think i think that's how we do that we"
6523440,6529520," cannot uh swap their content with zor right because it's not variables we're literally swapping the"
6529520,6530400," the the files"
6530400,6536800," so yeah i guess i guess that's what we're doing and that will automatically get rid of tmp if i"
6536800,6537600," understand correctly"
6537600,6541760," sorry the files well technically you can try to do that but i mean"
6541760,6546480," they have to be like the same length i presume to actually for this to work properly"
6546480,6553840," if you want to sort of the contents you know what i mean um"
6553840,6558480," okay"
6560320,6568960," xorin files believe it or not that should be it i think i think that should be it"
6570640,6578080," um just checking everything we might as well also just print something std"
6579840,6580240," um"
6580240,6584720," sorry files yeah cryptography yes"
6584720,6590400," uh all right so it's gonna be like this and it's gonna be"
6590400,6593200," all right"
6595840,6601440," i think that is it this is the entire algorithm believe it or not"
6601440,6604800," i think this is entire algorithm"
6604800,6610160," so let's rebuild the inverter"
6610160,6618400," and this is how we're going to try to work with that i'm going to go and do generate"
6619600,6624240," let's rebuild everything including generator and inverter"
6624240,6633840," okay so generate your mom let's see well okay let's generate a little bit bigger"
6633840,6640160," your mom should be a little bit bigger okay that's all right"
6640160,6646960," i would prefer like a medium size maybe maybe just something in between"
6649200,6653920," uh that's cool i think that's all right so let's do a tree"
6653920,6659520," on your mom okay this is a good looking tree"
6659520,6670000," this is a good looking tree i want to kind of save it uh before txt so we have a txt file this is"
6670000,6678720," before makes sense so then we will be able to compare them side by side um so are they i think"
6678720,6684480," they also ordered in lexicographical order which is actually pretty cool all right so inverter um"
6684480,6687920," let's do inverter inverter your mom"
6687920,6699600," okay it did things it did some things uh it did some things and now i'm going to uh treat after"
6699600,6702080," right let's take a look at it after"
6704080,6710480," okay i think it worked holy shit oh it doesn't it doesn't really display it properly but"
6710480,6718240," it doesn't squash it vertically if i know what i mean but i think it worked um so if i just take a look"
6718240,6730160," at the before uh before right so you have this streak of uh shallow files at the top but now you have them at the bottom"
6731520,6734800," i think i think oh yeah okay oh"
6734800,6757680," but i mean i guess it's all right because the order of the names is always fixed yeah the order of the names is always fixed"
6757680,6765440," uh because it's lexicographical one so the only thing we can actually reverse in here"
6765440,6775200," is the contents right that's why uh nancy 3 contained value and now it doesn't contain it in here but now"
6775200,6780880," the blueberry one contains all this i guess it makes sense given the limitations that we have to work with i"
6780880,6787840," i guess i guess i guess it's a good approximation like of translating that algorithm from binary tree to"
6787840,6795600," um yeah you know to the to the file system because in the file system like the order like the way you"
6795600,6801440," inverse the tree will depend on the order of the files right and which is lexicographical one and just"
6801440,6808640," yeah it is what it is but i think it works it's actually pretty cool uh okay so let me commit everything"
6810240,6820640," uh so yeah that's gonna be implement the inverter uh and i'm gonna push that right into the repo and also"
6820640,6836480," maybe i'm gonna just do that um oh yeah so essentially this is what's that uh and i suppose uh let me"
6839520,6842320," i think i want to like generate like a very small example"
6842320,6846000," somewhere that can transform this into this"
6846000,6853520," let me think"
6853520,6859520," so generate"
6862560,6873440," okay okay that's a pretty big one"
6873440,6873600," is that better"
6873600,6875600," what's the tree"
6875600,6888000," okay still too big"
6891680,6896000," i guess i guess i won't be able to generate a small one so i have to handcraft it unfortunately"
6896000,6904560," i don't really want to handcraft it but it is what it is so we're gonna have bar and full and in full"
6904560,6916480," we're gonna have buzz and then test uh maybe not okay but test and then here we're gonna have a touch hello"
6917360,6922320," we're gonna have a little bit about that world all right something like this uh and let me see if it's big enough"
6922320,6926160," if it's big enough i guess it is"
6926160,6939280," so let's put it like that so i i just want to make it look visible enough"
6941360,6952800," uh so after that i can try to invert the data right it got inverted to some extent and now it looks like"
6952800,6954960," like this so this is the result"
6954960,6964720," can you look at both of them"
6964720,6975280," that's actually pretty cool so this is what it was and this is what it became it literally inversed it"
6975280,6983600," like flipped it so it was in foo originally and then the content went into bar and inside of this thing"
6983600,6989360," test had all the content now test doesn't have it now buzz had it yes it inverted the file tree holy"
6989360,6996960," actually so yeah this is what i envisioned pretty much uh so"
7000800,7014000," so just flips everything"
7020960,7022080," tsmr yes"
7022080,7032560," okay go um so do i have everything in the yeah"
7032560,7038240," all right it's gonna be something like this"
7045040,7052080," yeah i guess i can i could copy paste this entire stuff in here just as a placeholder"
7052080,7054400," for something"
7054400,7066000," okay so to make generator data tree data invert data tree data and it's gonna be like that so this is a"
7066000,7066560," quick start"
7066560,7066560," quick start"
7066560,7069120," all right"
7069120,7074560," uh update"
7074560,7078000," i'm gonna put that right into the repo"
7078000,7080880," now you could do invert"
7080880,7088400," oh yeah so invert on the on the root is gonna fuck up your entire system that's for sure"
7088400,7094400," and wait a second is this operation reversible it must be reversible wait a second"
7095120,7098000," uh okay so if i try to invert it yet again"
7098000,7106160," and it is reversible so you just have to do the second time and but i don't know how it works with"
7106160,7116080," unusual file types like um symbols like character devices and maybe pipes and links like symbolic links"
7116080,7120320," and hard links i don't know how it will react to that so this entire program is designed to work just"
7120320,7126400," with the directories and regular files uh at least in terms of the postx uh should be the same okay"
7126400,7129440," very well then but the problem is that it it"
7132000,7136400," those symbols will break yeah probably it just renames the file so essentially it's just"
7136400,7143680," renamed in renaming the files um yeah okay so the entire thing should be available here"
7143680,7149040," it's completely open source i was developing it and pushing life so if you're interested in this"
7149040,7156480," kind of bullshit you can check it out um i remember how i removed the death tool nice"
7156480,7166960," um all right so that was fun not gonna lie oh ssun3 thank you so much for 500 bits thank you thank you"
7166960,7177680," thank you um yeah that is actually cool so who needs like you know at google they shouldn't ask to invert"
7177680,7184800," binary tree i mean because anyone can do that uh try to inverse file system that's way for a way more fun"
7186080,7194080," uh all right so again um check out this thing and i guess that's it for today i guess that's it for"
7194080,7201440," the reason goes literally um thanks everyone who's watching me right now really appreciate it uh have"
7201440,7206480," a good one and i see you tomorrow tomorrow according to the schedule uh during the first stream we're"
7206480,7212080," gonna do the virtual machine development or like programming language development uh check out our"
7212080,7217360," schedule page uh check out our votes channels and check out our discord server for offline discussion"
7217360,7224400," with the community uh and i don't know is anyone streaming anything interesting right now is anyone"
7224400,7238960," reversing a file tree right now so we can raid them um so i don't know and the twitch is very slow"
7242080,7248960," i think i think i know who that is day zero sec they're doing some like information security"
7248960,7257280," shit uh let's take a look at their title windows bugs teslas what's up man in the middle uh"
7257280,7263600," i don't know i watched a couple of their streams they're actually rather interesting so let me just see"
7263600,7273600," what they're doing right now um it was fixed in february and the tcpip.sys kernel driver um so they"
7273600,7278480," reverse engineered that patch tried to figure out what the issue was and ultimately wrote a poc for it"
7278480,7283040," though it i guess they're discussing like the latest vulnerabilities or something like that could be"
7283040,7293440," interesting let's let's write them why not um now you know what the question is yeah i've been programming"
7293440,7298240," for 15 years finally learned um okay so right"
7300640,7304240," um now you're thinking with portals"
7304240,7307120," okay"
7307120,7314720," get ready for the rate boys and girls get ready for the rate and i see you tomorrow love you"
