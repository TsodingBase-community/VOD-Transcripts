240,5920," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session with Amista"
5920,14240," Zozin. So today we're going to be looking into Web Audio API, right? So we already have in"
14240,21920," in browsers, we already have an audio HTML tag, right? But working with the audio HTML tags is"
21920,27520," not particularly convenient. This is something that we were doing in our game actually, right?"
27520,34720," So the coil, multiplayer game, right? So when you need to play a sound, what we literally did for each"
34720,40640," individual sound sample, we created a separate audio tag. And every time you need to play a sound,"
40640,48080," we just say to that tag, play yourself, right? Go play yourself. I'm not sure if you can hear that,"
48080,56800," but let me crank up the audio. So maybe you will be, yeah. Right. As you can hear, like it plays"
56800,64160," fine and stuff like that. But this is a very cucumbersome way of working with the audio,"
64160,71120," right? Real serious software developers, when they work with the audio, they want to actually have a"
71120,76400," really fine-grained control of the audio to the level that they want to be able to manipulate the"
76400,83680," buffers of the samples, right? You guys know what is the buffers of the samples? So essentially sound is a"
83680,88720," wave, right? It's a wave of the difference of the air pressure."
88720,95600," So the way audio is stored in the computers is that this wave of the difference of the"
95600,103040," pressure is actually sampled at regular intervals and measured. And then each sample is stored as a value."
103040,110160," And then you send that information to the sound card and sound card reproduces that"
110160,117840," wave of pressure, recreating the sound. Right. So essentially when people, when serious software"
117840,124640," developers work with audio, they want to be able to actually manipulate that buffer that contains these"
124640,130640," values because they want to maybe apply some effects or maybe mix them together or maybe,"
130640,136880," you know, make it louder or quieter and stuff like that. You want to be able to manipulate all of that."
136880,140880," Right. And unfortunately, for the longest time on the web, you couldn't do that."
141600,149040," But I suppose some time ago, finally, the developers of the browsers created some sort of a bindings"
149040,154480," to some internal libraries that they use in the browser. So you can actually do that in JavaScript."
155280,161840," And today I would like to actually explore that. Right. So it exists in the form of a web audio API."
161840,166560," And if I understood correctly from reading documentation, it's exactly what it is. Right."
166560,172560," It allows you to work with the audio on a low level. It is a basis for different audio libraries and stuff"
172560,177040," like that. But since we are serious software developers, we're not going to be using any libraries."
177040,183280," We're trying to understand how things work under the hood. So we're going to be exploring this low level"
183280,190480," raw API directly. And I'm doing that for the sole purpose of then later using it in our game."
190480,195040," As I already said, our game doing a very dumb approach. Right. It literally creates just audio"
195040,200960," tags, hidden ones. Right. So it just creates a hidden audio tags because they don't exist on the page."
200960,206400," And then just like literally presses the play button every time you need to to play a sound."
206400,211440," As far as in the old web, long time ago, in the times of Internet Explorer 6, this is literally how the"
211440,219200," website would do that. Right. So they just yeah, you know, all in the old web, there was a lot of hacks,"
219200,225840," a lot of shitty hacks like that. But these days, a lot of the low level libraries that are used in the"
225840,234480," browser, they have bindings into the JavaScript. Right. So all of these extensions to the web standards is"
234480,240480," basically forwarding the bindings from the C libraries used in the browser themselves. So you"
240480,247120," can also use the C libraries in JavaScript. That's basically the current trajectory of the web today."
247120,253520," Right. So the web doesn't introduce any innovation. It's not like we couldn't do 3D graphic before web."
253520,259680," It's not like we couldn't manipulate audio before web. We could do all of that way before web existed."
259680,266880," Even it's all already there. All of the code for doing all of that magical stuff is already on your computer."
266880,272480," You just you just couldn't do that from shaded JavaScript in a cross-platform way."
272480,278960," So the only innovation that the web standards are doing today, they're just allowing you to forward that"
278960,281920," beautiful functionality into your shitty script."
282960,287920," So that's the actual innovation the web standardization is doing these days. Just saying."
287920,297840," So I'm saying that I'm just realizing how depressing that sounds. Holy shit."
297840,302720," Because like if you think about that, right, so really web doesn't do any innovation."
302720,311440," All the innovation has happened outside of the web long time ago, long, long, long, long time ago."
311440,318240," And it's just like only then we finally agreed on how exactly we want to access that beautiful"
318240,323920," innovation in this shitty fucking language that just happened to be installed on every computer."
323920,328800," And that's the only reason we're using it. It's just so fucking depressing, isn't it?"
328800,333280," It's almost like the programmers just like forgot how to develop good software at all."
333280,335280," And it's not like nobody gives a shit."
335280,337600," It's fucking sad, isn't it?"
337600,339920," It's fucking sad."
339920,343600," But anyway, so that today we're looking at the web audio API."
343600,347120," So I think the sound is a little bit too loud."
347120,351520," Speaking of audio, speaking of audio, I think the sound is a bit too loud."
351520,354080," So let me actually maybe bring it down."
354080,356800," 10 out of 10 intro."
356800,357200," Thank you."
357200,359680," I didn't expect that myself, honestly."
359680,362000," All right."
362000,364720," So let's read about the web audio API."
364720,368560," It provides a powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on the web,"
368560,372960," allowing developers to choose audio sources, effects to audio, create audio visualization,"
372960,376400," apply special effects such as spanning and much more."
376400,379200," And this is something that you do want to have in your game."
379200,385520," So it involves handling audio operations inside an audio context, right?"
385520,387760," It's kind of similar probably to canvas, right?"
387760,391520," So the canvas has the canvas context where you can draw shapes."
391520,394000," And this thing has audio context."
394000,396560," And it has been designed to allow modular routing."
396560,398640," Oh, you can do some routing and shit."
398640,399200," Okay."
399200,401360," Basic audio operations are performed with audio."
401360,402640," Oh my, oh my God."
406000,413040," We're going to be doing blueprints and shit or something."
413040,419040," Um, blueprints and code, which is kind of a bizarre way to say that,"
419040,423040," but because blueprints are supposed to replace code, but, but anyway, whatever."
423040,425040," Is there any examples?"
425040,428400," A Slayer node, audio buffer source node."
428400,429680," Holy shit."
429680,429920," Okay."
429920,431120," So this is very interesting."
431120,431840," Audio context."
431840,434160," You have inputs, effects, and destination."
435360,435760," Okay."
435760,436400," That's pretty cool."
436400,438720," So audio web API target audience."
438720,439040," Okay."
439040,440640," So it's probably us."
440640,442080," I can seem intimidating."
442080,447840," The web audio API can seem intimidating to those that aren't familiar with audio or music terms."
447840,450400," And as it incorporates a great deal of functionality,"
450400,453600," it can prove difficult to get started if you are a developer."
456960,462800," I mean, I mean, who else do you have to be to work with a fucking API?"
462800,465920," If not a fucking developer."
465920,474640," It's intimidating if you are a developer."
474640,477520," That's a such a fucking bizarre thing to say."
477520,481440," You're working is with application programming interface."
481440,483520," And it's."
483520,487040," Audio developer."
487040,488560," Ah, okay."
488560,491520," So they expect great deal of hyper specialization."
491520,492960," Okay."
492960,497920," It can be used to incorporate audio into websites and application by providing atmosphere like"
497920,499680," future library."
499680,499920," No."
499920,503200," Uh, do I want to click on this website?"
503200,506320," So it's probably going to be too loud."
506320,508720," Loading."
508720,510480," Enter."
514320,516240," A forest in Norway is growing."
516240,521360," In 100 years, it will become an anthology of books."
521360,527360," Every year, a writer is contributing a text that will be held in trust."
527360,530160," Bro, you just plain video."
530160,530720," Fuck off."
530720,537200," Um, anyway, I get it."
537200,537600," I get it."
537600,538000," It's cool."
538000,538240," Cool."
538240,538560," I see."
538560,539360," I see."
539360,540880," Is there any examples?"
540880,542880," Uh, is there any examples of this?"
544000,549840," Um, so it's pretty much supported like everywhere, except maybe Firefox."
549840,552000," Fuck Firefox."
552000,553280," I'm using Firefox right now."
553280,553520," Okay."
553520,553920," Whatever."
553920,555920," Some things are not supported."
555920,559360," Uh, so create a media stream track source or whatever."
559360,562480," So basic using the web audio API."
562480,562720," Okay."
562720,563360," So that's perfect."
563360,565040," That's exactly what we want to have."
565040,568000," Let's take a look at getting started with the web audio API."
568000,572000," We'll briefly look at some concept, uh, then study a simple boom box."
574000,576000," Oh, it's, it's beatbox actually."
576000,580640," A boom box example that allows us to load an audio track, play and pause it, and change"
580640,582320," its volume and stereo panning."
582320,584480," This is exactly what we'll need in our game, by the way."
584480,588560," Uh, the web audio API does not replace the audio media element."
591120,594400," But that's exactly the point I'm, I want to use it for."
594400,597280," Freaking web."
597280,606960," So like I said specifically, I don't want to use the goddamn audio tag, and that's why I'm using"
606960,607440," web audio."
607440,608960," And this is, it doesn't replace it."
610080,612880," Oh, I mean, they probably mean it exists in parallel."
612880,613360," Okay."
613360,618000," So, but rather compliments it, just like canvas coexist alongside."
618000,622400," Ah, that's what we, I should have, I just, just read the, the, to the end of the sentence."
622400,622720," Okay."
622720,624480," So they rage baited me."
624480,626480," They fucking rage baited me."
626480,626640," Okay."
626640,631520," Anyway, uh, your use case will determine what tools you use to implement audio."
631520,636960," If you want to control playback of an audio track, the audio media element provides a better,"
636960,639760," quicker solution than the web audio API."
639760,645360," If you want to carry out more complex audio processing as well as playback, the web audio pro"
645360,651360," API provides much more powerful and fucking chat GPT as the sentences."
651360,651920," It's just like."
651920,657520," Like, I swear to God, all of that is generated by AI."
657520,659760," It's just like, it's so fucking anal to read."
659760,660480," It's insane."
660480,666160," A powerful feature of the web audio API is that it doesn't have a strict sound call"
666160,668320," limitation powerful feature."
668320,672720," It does not have a strict sound call limitations."
672720,678640," For example, there is no ceiling of 32 or 64 sound calls at one time."
678640,684160," Some processor may be capable of playing more than thousands simultaneously without stuttering."
684160,687920," Oh, so it does mixing of the sounds itself for you."
687920,689760," You don't have to mix your audio."
689760,690000," Okay."
690000,691040," That's actually very good."
691040,694480," So, uh, I didn't have to worry about this kind of stuff because some of the audio"
694480,696960," APIs require you to mix your sound yourself, right?"
696960,699840," They're incapable of playing sound simultaneously."
699840,701040," Looking at you, SDL."
701040,703840," Yes."
703840,706960," In SDL, you can't really play to sound simultaneously and"
706960,710560," unless you actually write like manual code for like mixing them."
710560,713920," I think there are some helpers that allow you to easily mix sounds."
713920,715280," Uh, right."
715280,720640," So, but I don't remember the details of SDL, but I remember having some problems with sound in SDL."
720640,720880," Yeah."
720880,721040," Yeah."
721040,722080," There is SDL mixer."
722080,722560," Yeah, exactly."
722560,722800," Thank you."
722800,723920," Thank you so much for reminding me."
723920,726960," There is like an SDL mixer and stuff like that."
726960,728960," So anyway, audio graphs."
728960,733760," Uh, everything within, um, audio API is based sound on a concept, blah, blah, blah, whatever."
734320,735120," Uh, right."
735120,736000," Which is made up notes."
736000,741040," The web audio handles audio operations inside the audio context that has designed for modular routing."
741040,746240," Basic audio operations that performs within nodes, which are linked together with audio routing graph."
746240,748880," You have input nodes, blah, blah, blah, whatever."
748880,749200," Okay."
749200,750240," Context."
750240,752800," So to be able to do anything with the web API,"
752800,755520," we need to create an instance of audio context."
755520,760160," Then, uh, this then gives us access to all features and functionality of the API."
760160,761360," Right."
761360,763680," So, so what's going on?"
763680,766400," A base audio context is created for us functioning."
766400,766560," Okay."
766560,767040," Whatever."
767040,769120," So let's actually jump into this entire shit."
769120,770560," It seems to be pretty easy."
770560,776560," Um, once we have an audio context, I suppose we can easily just explore the methods of this audio context"
776560,778080," and figure out what it's capable of doing."
778080,780320," So this is actually everything I needed, honestly."
780320,781520," Uh, right."
781520,784000," So web audio API."
784000,786960," So let's create a index HTML."
786960,788640," Uh, right."
788640,792960," And, uh, this is going to, can I just use something like, uh, yeah."
792960,795280," So does it."
795280,798000," Oh, look at that."
798000,800480," I know it's not particularly convenient."
800480,801600," So this is going to be hat."
801600,803680," This is going to be hat."
803680,804960," Right."
804960,807520," So this one is going to be obviously body."
807520,810480," So you have to do something like a doc type HTML."
810480,811680," If I'm not mistaken."
811680,811840," Right."
811840,812720," That's how you do that."
812720,814400," I think that's how we do that."
814400,817200," So, uh, HTML mode."
817200,817440," Yeah."
817440,820080," So let's do title."
820080,821040," Oh yeah."
821040,821600," This is one."
821600,826000," Web audio API."
826800,829680," And I suppose you don't have to create any nodes."
829680,832240," You can just start creating the audio context."
832240,832720," Right."
832720,833920," So this is actually pretty cool."
833920,835440," Uh, you know what?"
835440,841120," I think I want to actually use TypeScript because TypeScript will help me to easily navigate through the"
841120,846240," definitions of like audio context and other classes that are related to audio context and stuff like that."
846240,853440," So I think I'm going to actually create a NPM project or something like that."
853440,855120," Uh, right."
855120,857520," So let's, let me quickly do that chat."
857520,858640," NPM init."
858640,859920," Uh, right."
859920,860800," Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom."
860800,864560," NPM install TypeScript."
864560,867760," Uh, and like, uh, save dev."
867760,868880," Right."
868880,869280," Let's go."
871600,875120," So what do we have node bin TSC."
875120,875440," Right."
875440,879680," So we want to actually initialize the TypeScript project."
879680,880000," Right."
880000,883120," And that should create, uh, TS config."
883120,884640," So do I want to do anything in here?"
884640,885280," I don't think so."
885280,886800," I'm going to just keep it as it is."
886800,889440," And I'm going to create an MTS file."
889440,889760," Right."
889760,891360," So here is an MTS file."
891360,897360," And in here, I'm going to say console, uh, log, hello world."
897360,898080," There we go."
898080,900720," So when in here, I suppose I just want to go into the watch mode."
900720,901200," Uh, right."
901200,903760," And in the watch mode, it created MGS file."
903760,904960," Uh, right."
904960,906720," So which is exactly what I expected."
906720,907600," That's pretty cool."
907600,911120," So, and in here we are actually importing the MGS file."
911120,918640," So, uh, let me just open, uh, this entire thing in the Firefox, uh, and let's open the dev tools."
918640,920000," What do we have in console?"
920000,921600," Uh, we don't have shit in console."
921600,925200," What the fuck, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro."
925200,929920," Is that because it's MGS or something?"
929920,932480," Uh, expert declaration may only appear in the top level."
932480,936400," Ah, so I think you have to do something like a type module."
936400,936880," Don't you?"
936880,938960," That's what you have to do."
938960,941040," Uh, thanks so much, Mr. Black for Twitch Prime."
941040,941760," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
941760,943040," Yeah, type module."
943040,944880," I remember this shise, uh, look at that."
944880,947200," Are you fucking serious?"
947200,951200," Freaking web devs."
951200,953120," Why are you ruining web development?"
955840,962320," The coolest thing about web development locally was that you don't need any freaking servers or anything like that."
962320,963920," Freaking web devs."
963920,969680," Fuck you, web devs."
969680,972240," Anyway, so I can actually do Python script."
972240,974560," Uh, right, so with their course shits."
974560,976720," Uh, so HTTP, so..."
976720,979760," 69, 69."
979760,980560," All right."
980560,982160," So, let's go."
982160,984000," Uh, well, we have to go to local 16."
984000,985200," Yeah, hello world."
985200,986000," Look at that."
986000,986880," Look at that."
986880,990560," Who, who developed freaking course?"
992240,996000," It, I swear to God, course was developed by the devil himself."
996000,999440," Like, it must be."
999440,1000480," It fucking must be."
1000480,1004800," Anyways."
1004800,1007600," At least locally would be nice."
1007600,1010960," But, but it's safety noise and it's about safety."
1010960,1012240," Think about the children."
1012240,1015360," They don't even know how to use computers."
1015360,1016160," Think about them."
1016160,1019360," Anyway, so, uh, we've got this shit."
1019360,1020480," Cool."
1020480,1024480," Uh, so, let me now maybe create an audio context, right?"
1024480,1026720," So, there's going to be audio context."
1026720,1030640," New audio context."
1030640,1031920," Do we have an audio?"
1031920,1036960," Did I, I think I remember disabling, um, company mode."
1036960,1038160," Did I design?"
1038160,1040320," Yeah, I disabled the company mode for whatever reason."
1040320,1042800," So, let me actually fix that super quick."
1042800,1044480," Uh, do you have it installed?"
1044480,1047520," Yeah, it seems to, it seems like I have it installed."
1047520,1048640," All right."
1049280,1052480," So, new audio context."
1052480,1054800," Is it just that?"
1054800,1055520," Was it just that?"
1055520,1056320," I think it was just that."
1056320,1056960," There we go."
1056960,1060560," So, audio processing graph view from audio modules linked together."
1060560,1062800," Each represented by audio node."
1062800,1063520," Right."
1063520,1065360," So, we have a base latency."
1066400,1069360," You can create a media element source."
1069360,1072000," HTML media elements."
1072000,1074800," So, uh, let's take a look at that one."
1074800,1076000," So, this one is very interesting."
1076000,1078160," So, I load sounds."
1078160,1079920," Oh, wait."
1079920,1083760," So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
1083760,1089680," Do I understand freaking correctly that the relationship between audio context and audio text"
1089680,1095920," is the same as the relationship between the canvas context and image tags?"
1095920,1101280," That means I can have an image tag and then I can slap that image tag as an image."
1101280,1101520," Yes."
1101520,1102400," People say yes."
1102400,1103840," Okay."
1103840,1104880," This is actually pretty cool."
1104880,1107120," So, yo, what the fuck?"
1107120,1108000," Right."
1108000,1110560," So, I can just, I want to try that."
1110560,1111680," Wait a second."
1111680,1113040," Um, right."
1113040,1115440," I'm not reading any documentation."
1115440,1118880," I'm going off of the just assumptions of what the fuck is going on."
1118880,1119120," Right."
1119120,1120480," Uh, right."
1120480,1124320," So, I'm going to just grab the assets from the coil."
1124320,1124640," Right."
1124640,1127600," So, we have assets in here and we have some sounds and stuff like that."
1127600,1128720," So, here's a bunch of sounds."
1129200,1132000," And, uh, let me just copy paste the sounds in here."
1132000,1133360," Uh, right."
1133360,1135440," And I probably want to just load them up."
1135440,1137360," So, how do I load them up in the coil?"
1137360,1138160," I don't quite remember."
1138160,1138960," So, it's a client."
1138960,1140640," MTS."
1140640,1143280," So, I think it was audio."
1143280,1143440," Yeah."
1143440,1148160," So, there's the HTML audio element, but I suppose it is a media element."
1148160,1148480," Right."
1148480,1151760," So, it's more specific thing, but it's a media element nonetheless."
1151760,1152960," Uh, right."
1152960,1154960," And then how do we load the sounds?"
1154960,1156400," I remember that."
1156400,1156640," Yeah."
1156640,1158400," So, we just do new audio."
1158400,1158640," Right."
1158640,1161440," So, we just do new audio with the path to this entire thing."
1161440,1163040," And new audio is the audio element."
1163040,1163280," Okay."
1163280,1164480," That's actually perfection."
1164480,1165840," Uh, right."
1165840,1170320," So, in here, uh, I can just grab all of these things."
1170320,1173680," Can I do something like this?"
1173680,1174560," Right."
1174560,1176240," So, here are all of the files."
1176240,1179520," Then, in here, I can simply copy paste them."
1179520,1185280," We don't really need credits txt, but the only thing we need in here is, uh, this thing."
1185280,1186640," Right."
1186640,1191440," So, we have a bunch of files, as you can see, uh, we can select them like so."
1191440,1198320," Maybe even, uh, just, huh, can't really easily do that."
1198320,1201840," But what if I replace this thing with underscore?"
1201840,1205760," Because the only thing I kind of want to do, I want to select their int."
1205760,1207200," Yeah, that's exactly what I want to do."
1207200,1207760," There we go."
1207760,1213920," So, can I now do const that name equal to new audio like that?"
1213920,1215040," Boom."
1215040,1216000," Right."
1216000,1218560," So, I just loaded up a bunch of things in here."
1218560,1222400," So, maybe, uh, we're gonna go for the, uh, for the camel case."
1222400,1223360," Um, right."
1223360,1227360," So, I think the camel case is going to look nice in here."
1227360,1233680," Uh, so now, if I go to here, and I want to go to the network, and I want to refresh this and"
1233680,1234000," that stuff."
1234000,1235360," So, as you can see, it loads..."
1235680,1236720," Nah, not really."
1236720,1236960," Right."
1236960,1240800," So, all of that is located within the sound folder."
1240800,1241760," Right."
1241760,1244640," So, all of that is within the sound folder."
1244640,1246160," Uh, right."
1246160,1246800," Sounds."
1246800,1247840," Right."
1247840,1250800," And if I try to refresh that, uh, it kinda..."
1250800,1253760," It didn't..."
1253760,1254160," Yeah, yeah."
1254160,1255360," Because I'm an idiot."
1255360,1256480," Uh, right."
1256480,1258640," So, I need to bring all of that stuff back."
1258640,1260960," Uh, so, and now that seems to be working."
1260960,1265200," So, we're loading all of the, uh, sounds and assets and stuff like that."
1265280,1268880," So, and I suppose, once I created an audio context."
1268880,1269120," Right."
1269120,1270080," So, an audio context."
1270080,1272800," Um, I should be able to play a sound."
1272800,1274160," Right."
1274160,1276000," So, create media."
1276000,1277600," Aha."
1277600,1281680," But it just creates an element source."
1281680,1283760," Right."
1283760,1284960," It just creates an element source."
1284960,1287680," But it feels like it doesn't mean it's going to play, though."
1287680,1288560," Right."
1288560,1289920," It doesn't mean that it's going to play."
1289920,1290960," All right."
1290960,1292640," Let me try an interesting thing."
1292640,1297360," I'm going to try to print the audio context just to see what it's going to say."
1297360,1299360," In the console, at least."
1299360,1300160," Right."
1300160,1301440," So, here's the audio context."
1301440,1302560," That's pretty cool."
1302560,1304880," So, then, uh, if I go here."
1304880,1306880," Create media element source."
1306880,1308960," That is definitely going to be a source."
1308960,1309200," Right."
1309200,1311680," Audio context source."
1311680,1313200," And I'm going to create a blast."
1313200,1314560," Right."
1314560,1318240," So, that probably created some sort of a source."
1318240,1319520," All right."
1319520,1321040," So, that is the source."
1321040,1323520," And let's print the source and look at it."
1323520,1325040," Right."
1325040,1328800," So, media element audio source node."
1328800,1329600," That's pretty cool."
1329600,1331120," Okay."
1331120,1332000," We created that."
1332000,1335040," So, what's the media element?"
1335040,1337520," It has no inputs in exactly one output."
1337520,1339600," And it is created using the audio context."
1339600,1344960," The amount of channels in the output equals to the number of channels of the audio"
1344960,1347520," referenced by media used in create."
1347520,1348880," Okay."
1348880,1349760," So, that's pretty cool."
1349760,1350480," That's pretty cool."
1350480,1355360," So, I suppose now we have to reroute this motherfucker somewhere."
1355360,1356880," So, it's an audio node."
1356880,1358960," That means it should be possible to..."
1358960,1360720," Okay."
1360720,1365360," So, it has a connect."
1365360,1367280," Right."
1367280,1372800," Which means that I can just grab this entire motherfucker and say connect."
1372800,1374400," But what can we connect it to?"
1374400,1376960," Can we connect this motherfucker to something like..."
1378880,1383520," There was a createMediaStringDestination."
1383520,1387040," StreamSource."
1387040,1390720," GetOutputTimeStamp."
1390720,1395680," So, what's the difference between..."
1395680,1396160," So, okay."
1396160,1396880," This is the source."
1396880,1398560," What is the difference?"
1398560,1399040," Media..."
1399040,1401120," Ah."
1401120,1402720," It just accepts different thing."
1402720,1403760," Right."
1403760,1408320," So, the difference between that and that is that it accepts different input."
1408320,1412080," It's either MediaStream or HTML tag."
1412080,1412480," Oh, okay."
1412480,1415120," So, that means you can accept streams from event..."
1415120,1416000," Ah."
1416000,1419120," I think I know what the fuck it is."
1419120,1423840," It's when you're downloading the MediaStream from somewhere."
1423840,1429280," You make a fetch request and you're receiving the chunks of an audio file."
1429280,1434800," And you can actually turn it into MediaStreamSource and reroute it into the dist..."
1434800,1437680," Holy fucking shit, my friend."
1437680,1439680," What the fuck is this advanced magic?"
1439680,1441040," Oh my god."
1441040,1446480," So, and I suppose here is the destination node and we have to create this destination node."
1446480,1451840," So, there's not that much information about this thing, at least in the source code of the types."
1451840,1453280," So, can we take a look at this stuff?"
1454400,1458560," So, the method to audio context is used to create a new dist..."
1458560,1463040," Look, look at this text."
1463040,1466560," It really feels like ChatGPT generated."
1466560,1471040," Motherfucker, I can read what it does from its name."
1471040,1473840," Like, I mean, don't you think that the..."
1473840,1480640," I don't know that the method createMediaStreamDestination is used to createMediaStreamDestination."
1480640,1484960," Who fucking writes documentation like that?"
1484960,1487120," It's just like, I can't read the method."
1487120,1490000," Fucking, like, why people do that?"
1490000,1493840," Why the fuck people do that?"
1494640,1496240," So, fucking annoying."
1496240,1496560," Anyway."
1496560,1502240," So, media is created destination stream attribute."
1502240,1503920," I wouldn't know yet."
1503920,1506320," So, in the following..."
1506320,1507200," No, no, don't show me example."
1507200,1509040," I actually want to figure it out myself."
1509040,1511280," I actually really want to figure it out myself."
1511280,1512320," Right."
1512320,1518160," So, let's create media stream destination."
1518160,1521440," And what's funny is that doesn't really accept anything."
1521440,1521680," Right."
1521680,1523840," So, this thing doesn't really accept anything."
1523840,1525440," So, let's actually just create it."
1525440,1528480," Destination of our nation."
1528480,1532320," And can I now say source connect."
1532320,1533680," Right."
1533680,1536080," So, to the destination."
1536080,1538720," Everything type checks."
1538720,1539280," Look at that."
1540000,1542480," We're using TypeScript for a reason."
1542480,1544800," So, we can actually type check this in desktop."
1544800,1545920," This is fucking awesome."
1545920,1548320," I wonder, by the way."
1548320,1550240," I wonder, by the way."
1550240,1552320," I wonder, by the way."
1552320,1555120," If we can basically create notes for all of them."
1555120,1556000," Right."
1556000,1559920," So, maybe I can call this thing like a blast source."
1559920,1560880," Right."
1560880,1566560," So, then later I can maybe even copy-paste all of these things."
1567920,1570400," And just do something like that."
1570400,1571040," So, this is going to be..."
1571040,1574640," So, this is source."
1574640,1579360," And then audio context create media."
1579360,1580880," Yep."
1580880,1582400," For fuck's sake."
1582400,1586800," There's something annoying about multiple curses."
1586800,1588000," Honestly, media."
1588000,1589120," Uh-huh."
1589120,1589920," And then boom."
1589920,1591360," Fuck."
1591360,1592800," We lost the name."
1592800,1594800," All right."
1594800,1596880," So, we're almost there, chat."
1596880,1601040," And this is what I need, actually."
1601040,1606560," Okay."
1606560,1609600," So, basically, we have sources for all of the files in here."
1609600,1613040," In fact, we could probably even inline them."
1613040,1614480," Who said we can't do that?"
1614480,1615680," Well, we can actually inline them."
1615680,1617280," But besides the point."
1617280,1619440," So, we have destination."
1619440,1620560," And I suppose that's it."
1620560,1620720," Right."
1620720,1623200," So, it's not going to play anything per se."
1623200,1623440," Right."
1623440,1625680," It doesn't play anything."
1625680,1628160," So, audio context was prevented from started automatically."
1628160,1631680," It must be created or resumed after the user gesture on the page."
1633760,1647840," I mean, it's not that critical of an issue."
1647840,1649360," Honestly."
1649360,1650560," But thank you."
1650560,1652240," So, I suppose."
1661440,1666640," So, I suppose we need to listen to some events."
1666640,1669520," We need to listen to some events."
1669520,1676480," So, it must be created or resumed after a user gesture on the page."
1676480,1678080," Blut sound."
1678080,1685120," Because remember that Minecraft video with like a disappearing house?"
1686800,1687520," It's that sound."
1687520,1690080," It's actually that sound."
1690080,1691600," I suppose."
1691600,1694240," Can we just like add event listener?"
1694240,1696480," And what kind of events can we have?"
1696480,1699280," So, there's an event menu thingy."
1699280,1701680," Global events handler."
1701680,1702800," Window events handler."
1702800,1704080," So, gesture."
1704080,1707760," Right."
1707760,1708400," Gesture."
1709840,1714800," Does anybody have any like a good suggestions for the event to do that on?"
1714800,1716400," Right."
1716400,1718400," Gesture."
1718400,1721440," So, maybe mouse move?"
1721440,1723440," We can try mouse move."
1723440,1724800," A button."
1724800,1727520," A button on click."
1727520,1731200," Okay."
1731200,1731440," Sure."
1731440,1733840," Let's create lobotone."
1733840,1736000," How to create lobotone in HTML?"
1736000,1738160," On load."
1738160,1740800," On click."
1740800,1743440," Add event."
1743440,1749280," Is there something like click on window?"
1749280,1752080," Okay."
1752080,1752480," There is."
1752480,1757200," So, we can try to maybe put all of that stuff in here."
1757760,1758240," Like so."
1758240,1760800," All right."
1760800,1761440," So, let's go."
1761440,1763200," Did it play anything?"
1763200,1765280," I think it didn't play anything."
1765280,1766480," So, which is fine."
1766480,1766720," Right."
1766720,1768560," So, we don't want it to play anything anyway."
1768560,1771280," So, in an audio context."
1771280,1772320," In an audio context."
1772320,1775120," So, we have also based audio context."
1775120,1777200," And we can."
1777200,1778720," Oh, that's a lot of cool things."
1778720,1780960," Wave Shaper."
1780960,1782160," Holy shit."
1782160,1785040," Holy shit."
1786640,1789840," So, in here."
1789840,1790560," We don't really."
1790560,1793360," Resume or suspend."
1793360,1794480," Or anything like that."
1794480,1797440," So, let me try."
1797440,1799920," So, here is everything connected."
1799920,1802960," And then I take audio context."
1802960,1804560," And I just resume this thing."
1804560,1805760," And let's see what's going to happen."
1805760,1807680," Nothing happens."
1807680,1809120," Which is expectable."
1809120,1809520," All right."
1809520,1810480," So, that's fine."
1810480,1811920," What I want to try now."
1811920,1814320," I want to try to take the blast source."
1814320,1815520," And maybe play it."
1815520,1819440," There's no way to really play it."
1819440,1820400," Unfortunately."
1820400,1821280," Right."
1821280,1823600," There's no way to really play it."
1823600,1825200," Let me see."
1825200,1826800," If there's anything interesting."
1826800,1828080," So, there's the audio node."
1828080,1830160," So, you can connect."
1830160,1832880," But that's about it."
1835200,1837440," It runs on click on the loading."
1837440,1838960," Why are people talking about clicks?"
1838960,1840560," And I don't freaking understand."
1840560,1841520," Oh, yeah."
1841520,1842160," It runs on click."
1842160,1842400," Yeah."
1842400,1842960," Oh, yeah."
1842960,1843920," I already forgot."
1843920,1846960," My mind already went into different places."
1846960,1848720," Yeah."
1848720,1848880," Yeah."
1848880,1849520," I forgot."
1849520,1849920," I'm sorry."
1849920,1852160," All right."
1852160,1852800," So, that's cool."
1852800,1854400," This is without resume."
1854400,1855920," Right."
1855920,1858880," So, audio context resume."
1858880,1859280," All right."
1859280,1860400," So, that's cool."
1860400,1862240," Let's refresh this entire thing."
1862240,1864480," Nothing happens as well."
1864480,1864800," Okay."
1864800,1865840," So, that's understandable."
1865840,1868320," We might as well actually maybe print something."
1868320,1871520," Console.log click."
1871520,1872400," Right."
1872400,1873600," So, just in case."
1875040,1875360," Right."
1875360,1877200," So, it does make a click."
1877200,1878720," But it doesn't really play anything."
1878720,1883280," So, okay."
1883280,1887280," So, in here we can't play that."
1887280,1888960," Blast sound."
1888960,1890880," Right."
1890880,1892800," We can't play that."
1892800,1893680," Maybe resume."
1893680,1895040," Or maybe."
1895040,1895760," Okay."
1895760,1898400," So, I think I give up."
1898400,1898640," Right."
1898640,1900240," So, what I was trying to do actually."
1900240,1904560," I was trying to see if I can figure out how to use this API"
1904560,1907040," without using any documentation or any examples."
1907040,1908960," Just going off of the types."
1908960,1910560," But apparently it's not possible."
1910560,1910800," Right."
1910800,1911440," So, because."
1911440,1911680," Okay."
1911680,1913040," I created the source node."
1913040,1914560," I created the destination node."
1914560,1917040," What else?"
1917040,1919040," Do I have to do something with the destination?"
1919040,1920960," Maybe I have to do something with the destination."
1920960,1922320," Right."
1922320,1923120," So, play."
1923120,1924560," Resume."
1924560,1925280," It doesn't really."
1925280,1925520," Wait."
1925520,1925920," Wait."
1925920,1927600," So, there was a remove listening."
1927600,1927840," Yeah."
1927840,1928800," I didn't see anything."
1928800,1930880," So, that means I need to look into the examples."
1930880,1931120," Right."
1931120,1933360," Right."
1933360,1935200," So, I have to look into the examples."
1935200,1936880," Okay."
1936880,1938880," So, here is the using."
1938880,1942960," Is that a using?"
1942960,1943200," Okay."
1943200,1944800," So, okay."
1944800,1945840," They create an audio."
1945840,1949920," But, I mean, we already create audio tags, you know, ourselves."
1949920,1950240," Okay."
1950240,1953360," So, we figured out that we have to create an element source and stuff like that."
1953360,1953600," Okay."
1953600,1954480," Controlling sound."
1954480,1956880," All right."
1956880,1960480," When playing sound on the web, it's important to allow the user to control it."
1960480,1963200," Depending on the use case, there is a myriad of options."
1963200,1965040," I don't want to read this shit."
1965040,1966480," Just give me examples, motherfucker."
1966480,1968320," Okay."
1968320,1970560," So, track."
1970560,1972960," We already did that."
1972960,1973760," Oh, wait."
1973760,1976000," Audio context destination."
1979520,1979840," Wait."
1979840,1981680," Why does it have a separate?"
1981680,1984480," Why can you create stream?"
1984480,1989360," What is this API?"
1989360,1994240," If you're supposed to connect the blast sound to audio context destination,"
1994240,1996640," why the fuck do you have this method that creates another?"
1997200,1998240," What is going on?"
1998240,2003920," What the fuck is going on for a stream?"
2003920,2006240," And this one is not a stream."
2006240,2007920," It's an audio destination."
2007920,2009120," So, okay."
2009120,2011040," So, this is how you had to connect that."
2011040,2013200," Right?"
2013200,2014800," I guess."
2014800,2016160," All right."
2016160,2017760," So, maybe now it will work?"
2017760,2020320," Nah, it doesn't work."
2020320,2020560," Okay."
2020560,2021280," So, let's see."
2021280,2022560," What's next we have to do?"
2023520,2023920," Okay."
2023920,2028160," So, audio context suspended."
2028160,2028880," We resume it."
2028880,2030320," We always resume."
2030320,2031600," Audio element play."
2031600,2035200," But it's an audio."
2035200,2038800," You have to play the original audio element."
2038800,2040080," That's what you have to do."
2040080,2041600," What?"
2041600,2043520," Are you freaking serious, my friend?"
2043520,2046640," Is that really what you have to do?"
2046640,2052640," What's the point of this API?"
2052640,2053040," Okay."
2053040,2056160," I can just play it without any of that bullshit."
2056160,2059920," Motherfucker."
2059920,2064960," Okay."
2064960,2065680," Stream is over."
2065680,2066880," This API is useless."
2066880,2075760," This is like..."
2075760,2089360," I suppose it's for applying effects or something like that."
2089360,2089680," That's..."
2089680,2090960," Is that the point?"
2090960,2092320," Is that the point?"
2100320,2101200," filters maybe?"
2101200,2103200," Probably for filters and shit like that."
2103200,2103840," And it's just like..."
2103840,2107600," Okay."
2107600,2108000," Fair."
2108000,2110400," I suppose."
2110400,2112000," Fair."
2112000,2115040," Effects, filter, mixing, stream audio, I guess."
2115040,2115360," Yeah."
2115360,2115680," Okay."
2115680,2116080," Okay."
2116080,2116400," Okay."
2116400,2118400," But..."
2118400,2118640," Okay."
2118640,2122000," So, what if I want to play several of them simultaneously?"
2122000,2124080," Is there any way to do that easily?"
2124080,2124400," Maybe?"
2124400,2126400," I don't freaking know."
2126400,2129680," So, yeah."
2129680,2131440," Funnily enough."
2131440,2132720," Funnily enough."
2132720,2134880," Nah."
2136160,2137840," It's kind of dumb, isn't it?"
2137840,2138880," I think it's kind of dumb."
2138880,2144560," What about creating source?"
2144560,2146320," Creating source."
2146320,2149200," Not from HTML tags."
2149200,2150880," Not from HTML tags."
2150880,2153120," But from actual data."
2153120,2154480," Right."
2154480,2155600," Can we actually do that?"
2155600,2158640," So, some people actually suggest like a create buffer source."
2158640,2158880," Right."
2158880,2160560," So, I already see that."
2160560,2161840," So, create buffer source."
2161840,2164400," Let's take a look at this entire stuff."
2164400,2164640," Right."
2164640,2165920," Audio context."
2165920,2169120," Create a buffer source."
2169120,2169280," Okay."
2169280,2170640," So, you can create a buffer."
2170640,2172880," So, it's an audio buffer."
2172880,2174800," And a buffer source."
2174800,2176720," All right."
2176720,2179040," So, we have an audio buffer source node."
2179040,2181920," Audio scheduled source node."
2181920,2183440," So, audio buffer."
2183440,2184400," Audio buffer."
2184400,2189760," And what the fuck is audio buffer?"
2193600,2197200," Oh, now we are fucking talking."
2197200,2200400," This is what I'm talking about, bruv."
2200400,2202880," Float32 array."
2202880,2205040," Float32 array."
2205040,2207920," The array of goddamn fucking samples."
2207920,2208720," That means."
2208720,2210560," That means."
2210560,2211040," Chat."
2211040,2211520," That means."
2211520,2213920," In WebAssembly."
2213920,2214240," Right."
2214240,2218560," I can do a similar thing that I did with images, right?"
2218560,2222720," Where I just de-encoded them and concatenated them into the binary blob."
2222720,2228160," I can take all of my sounds and compress them and put them in the binary blob."
2228720,2235040," And then, from wasm, I can tell WebAssembly, create a sound out of this blob of bytes."
2235040,2240240," And it will create a sound so I can store sounds within WebAssembly."
2241840,2243200," This is exactly what I..."
2243200,2246320," This is exactly what I'm talking about."
2246320,2248560," Thank you so much, whoever actually suggested that."
2248560,2250000," The rugged bear."
2250000,2250800," The rugged bear."
2250800,2252160," Right."
2252160,2254240," So, I'm going to give you a VIP."
2254240,2255920," I'm going to give you a VIP."
2258160,2260240," So, this is cool, my friend."
2260240,2260960," This is cool."
2260960,2264960," This is exactly what I wanted to have."
2264960,2266880," So, I don't know."
2266880,2267520," Like, we need to..."
2267520,2270560," How are we going to be doing all that?"
2270560,2271840," How are we going to be doing all that?"
2271840,2273920," How can we test this and that thing?"
2273920,2281760," We can try to generate some sounds."
2281760,2283280," Right."
2283280,2285360," Because I already did a stream."
2285360,2286720," Not really a stream, but a video."
2286720,2289360," Long, long, long time ago on my old channel."
2289360,2291280," On my main channel, I would even say."
2291280,2293280," Where I was writing music in Haskell."
2293280,2294640," Right."
2294640,2297040," So, and the way I was writing music in Haskell."
2297040,2299360," I was actually literally generating these samples."
2299360,2302640," You know, float by float."
2302640,2304720," And then playing them in Aplay and stuff like that."
2304720,2308240," And then showcase the math behind all of that process."
2308240,2311280," We can use a similar thing in JavaScript in a browser."
2311280,2314640," To synthesize new sounds and actually play them."
2316160,2317360," That's the thing we can do."
2317360,2319120," We can synthesize new sounds."
2319120,2320960," Right."
2320960,2322800," So, that's pretty cool."
2322800,2325840," And this is probably something that we should try."
2325840,2329680," So, let me actually read if the destination really is what I think it is."
2329680,2329920," Right."
2329920,2331600," So, the channel number..."
2331600,2331840," Yeah."
2331840,2336480," So, I suppose if you have two channels, the samples of the channels are going to be interleaved."
2336480,2336720," Right."
2336720,2337520," So, obviously."
2337520,2342480," You also specify sample rate and stuff."
2342480,2344800," This is so goddamn fucking cool, bro."
2344800,2346640," This is so goddamn fucking cool."
2346640,2349760," This is probably something that we're going to be exploring today."
2350640,2352480," Copy from method interface."
2352480,2356000," Destination."
2356000,2357760," A copy of the channels samples too."
2357760,2358080," Okay."
2358080,2358640," So, thank you."
2358640,2360400," That's the only thing..."
2360400,2365360," Like, I was opening this entire documentation specifically for one single word."
2365360,2369360," Which is a good indicator that the variable name fucking sucks."
2370160,2371760," It should have been destination samples."
2371760,2378480," Imagine opening documentation specifically for one word that could have been just a fucking variable name."
2378480,2387280," And those people are constantly talking about like a developer experience and stuff like that."
2387280,2391040," Developing more and more sophisticated ideas to help with the developer experience."
2391040,2395200," But they're incapable of putting just one single word into a fucking variable."
2395200,2397280," So, developers don't have to go into documentation."
2399200,2402400," So, anyways."
2402400,2405200," Now, you know what?"
2405200,2407600," I think I want to make a small break."
2407600,2408000," Right."
2408000,2410480," I think I want to make a small break and make a cup of tea."
2410480,2415360," And after the small break, we're going to try to do something cool."
2415360,2418480," Like generating, like synthesizing sounds."
2418480,2419280," Right."
2419280,2421040," So, I think that's a good plan."
2421040,2422000," That's a good plan."
2422000,2424480," So, I think this API has potential."
2424480,2427280," And we're probably going to be using it in our game."
2427280,2427760," So, anyway."
2428720,2429440," All right."
2429440,2430000," We're back."
2430000,2434080," And so, let's go ahead and try to create an audio buffer."
2434080,2434480," Right."
2434480,2435600," So, let's see."
2435600,2437360," Buffer."
2437360,2439280," So, this is that."
2439280,2443120," I'm not going to be playing any of the sounds right now."
2443120,2448320," But what I'm going to be doing is after I created the buffer, I want to just console log it."
2448960,2450960," Console log the buffer."
2450960,2452000," Console log the buffer."
2452000,2454320," And yesu, yesu, yesu."
2454320,2455840," So, what do we have in here?"
2455840,2456720," Okay."
2456720,2458880," So, this is the audio buffer source node."
2458880,2460880," Doesn't really do anything."
2460880,2461040," Right."
2461040,2462000," So, it's kind of useless."
2463040,2464560," To the audio buffer source."
2464560,2466560," As you can see, it doesn't accept anything."
2466560,2472320," So, I suppose the data has to be shoved into that thing through the copy."
2472320,2472880," Right."
2472880,2474640," So, it has to be through the copy."
2475920,2478080," So, this is a scheduled source node."
2478080,2479520," So, by itself, it's useless."
2479520,2483200," So, what you have to do, you have to take its audio buffer."
2483200,2483920," Right."
2483920,2484960," It's audio buffer."
2484960,2488320," And then copy something from channel and so on and so forth."
2488320,2489920," Right."
2489920,2491440," So, copy from."
2491440,2492880," Oh, it's actually funny."
2492880,2493280," You can."
2493280,2498240," I wonder if you can use that to extract some stuff."
2498240,2500080," Wait a second."
2500080,2501440," So, if I have an audio."
2501440,2504080," Do I have a buffer?"
2504080,2504400," Okay."
2504400,2507760," So, audio is HTML audio element."
2507760,2509680," HTML media element."
2509680,2510960," Does it have a buffer?"
2510960,2513280," Buffered?"
2513280,2514560," No, it doesn't have a buffer."
2531760,2532320," Yeah."
2532320,2538960," So, I was thinking maybe I can actually load the audio like this and then grab its samples and do something with them."
2538960,2541520," That would be actually kind of cool, I think."
2541520,2546320," And by the way, another thing that kind of worries me in here is that the audio buffer can be new."
2546320,2548560," Huh."
2548560,2550400," Are you for real?"
2550400,2552640," Are you for fucking real?"
2553200,2557200," So, if I take a look at that."
2557200,2557440," Yeah."
2557440,2558400," It is new."
2558400,2559760," It is original new."
2559760,2562000," So, just creating it like that is not enough."
2562000,2566960," One of the things I will have today, I will have to create an audio buffer itself."
2566960,2568880," But the question is, how do I create it?"
2568880,2569040," Okay."
2569040,2571440," So, I can create it like this."
2571440,2572800," Right."
2572800,2579440," So, this is more like a source buffer source, but what I want to do is actually just a buffer."
2579440,2581920," New audio buffer."
2581920,2582960," Right."
2582960,2584400," So, I can do that."
2584400,2588400," But that's not enough because it wants to have these buffer options."
2588400,2592880," And what the fucker, but okay, okay, okay, okay."
2592880,2595760," So, this is simple."
2595760,2596400," Right."
2596400,2604000," But, listen, maybe the buffer is actually created automatically if you try to copy."
2604000,2607360," Ah, copying is on the buffer itself."
2607360,2607600," Right."
2607600,2609200," So, it's on the buffer itself."
2609200,2610880," All right."
2610880,2613520," So, let me just grab the options."
2613520,2614400," Right."
2614400,2619680," Let's just grab the options and see what we can do in here."
2619680,2621200," So, you have to specify..."
2621200,2623040," This is actually kind of cool."
2623040,2624320," This is actually kind of based."
2624320,2625200," Right."
2625200,2625920," The amount of..."
2625920,2627520," Let's say that this thing..."
2627520,2629680," The usual sample rate."
2629680,2630160," Right."
2630160,2634640," So, I think the usual sample rate is usually 48000."
2634640,2634880," Right."
2634880,2639840," So, there's another one that is smaller, but this one I just remember off the top of my head."
2639840,2640080," Right."
2640080,2641680," So, that's a very useful one."
2642640,2647200," Then, if we want to generate like a one second of the sound."
2647200,2649360," Yeah, 44100."
2649360,2649600," Yeah."
2649600,2650400," That's another one."
2650400,2652000," Might as well actually put it somewhere here."
2652000,2654000," 44100."
2654000,2654240," Right."
2654240,2655440," And just comment it out."
2655440,2657360," So, I can swoosh between them."
2657360,2662400," So, let's say we want to generate like one second of the sound."
2662400,2662640," Right."
2662640,2664560," So, this is going to be sample rate."
2664560,2666160," So, that's the length."
2666160,2669040," So, this is the buffer that holds one second."
2669040,2672160," And the amount of channels, I suppose we're going to just have one channel."
2672640,2675440," But it would be nice to actually just have it in here."
2675440,2677200," Yeah."
2677200,2681120," Honestly, let's factor out all of these values in here."
2681120,2685200," Because maybe I want to be able to use them as I generate things."
2685200,2689040," So, as I generate things, I want to be able to use them."
2689040,2690560," Uh-huh."
2690560,2693040," So, here is the audio buffer."
2693040,2693520," Right."
2693520,2696400," And yeah, that's about it."
2696400,2698400," That's literally about it."
2698400,2702560," And then, after that, what I can do, I can copy from channel."
2702560,2702960," Okay."
2702960,2704560," So, I can copy from channel."
2704560,2707040," And this is the channel number."
2707040,2711440," Wait."
2711440,2719200," So, do I understand correctly that it copies data into the destination?"
2719200,2723920," So, it gets data out of the audio buffer."
2723920,2725360," It gets data."
2725360,2726080," It's not copy."
2726080,2726320," Yeah."
2726320,2730800," So, I think this thing gets data out of the audio buffer."
2730800,2732480," That's what's literally going on here."
2732480,2737520," So, method interface copy is the audio sample from the specified channel."
2737520,2737840," Okay."
2737840,2739680," Uh-huh, uh-huh."
2739680,2740800," Okay."
2740800,2741680," That's pretty cool."
2741680,2746880," And the copying to channel, you can copy some data there."
2746880,2755760," So, method interface copy is the samples to the specified channel of the audio buffer"
2755760,2756960," from the source array."
2756960,2757280," Okay."
2757280,2758560," Okay, okay."
2758560,2760800," So, copy to channel."
2760800,2763920," Uh, let's take that."
2763920,2768160," And, uh, so, we need to generate the source, right?"
2768160,2771760," Um, and how the channels are numbered, by the way?"
2771760,2773840," Uh, channel number."
2773840,2778080," Uh, the channel number of the current copy."
2778080,2781040," If channel number is greater than or equal to the number of channels."
2781040,2782320," Uh-huh."
2782320,2784880," Greater or equal, that means they are numbered from zero."
2784880,2787520," So, that means the first channel is actually zero."
2787520,2788560," All right."
2788560,2790160," So, this is going to be the zero's channel."
2790160,2792240," And buffer offset, we're not going to be upsetting anything."
2792240,2796800," So, the only thing we need to do in here is to create the source, right?"
2796800,2800640," So, it's going to be float32 array, right?"
2800640,2801840," So, that's what we have in here."
2801840,2808480," But then we have to, I suppose, you can't really create it like that."
2809840,2812080," I suppose what you have to do."
2812080,2816480," Uh, this also works audio buffer get channel data."
2816480,2817440," Ah, okay."
2817440,2820080," So, get channel data."
2820080,2820960," All right."
2820960,2822800," Well, I mean, it was nearby."
2822800,2823120," Whatever."
2823120,2823600," Doesn't matter."
2823600,2824480," This is not what we're doing."
2824480,2826800," We're getting stuff into the buffer, not out."
2827440,2827680," Okay."
2827680,2831520," So, it has nothing to do with what I'm trying to do."
2831520,2835920," I suppose the thing we need to do in here, we need to have an array buffer."
2835920,2836880," Right."
2836880,2838080," So, we need to have a..."
2838080,2842080," So, if I'm going to create float32 array, right?"
2842080,2843360," So, what are the constructors?"
2843360,2843680," Okay."
2843680,2844880," So, I can have a length."
2844880,2847920," I can specify the amount of samples, right?"
2847920,2852000," So, it's going to be basically a length, right?"
2852000,2853200," So, this is the source."
2853200,2856800," This is the source and this is that."
2856800,2857440," Okay."
2857440,2861200," So, afterwards, finally, fucking finally, bro."
2861200,2866320," I can generate some sounds, right?"
2866320,2867680," I can generate some sounds."
2867680,2870720," And the question is how we're going to be generating all of these sounds."
2872720,2878000," So, I completely forgot how to do that."
2878000,2879680," So, I'll have to figure it out."
2879680,2884160," All right."
2884160,2886560," So, I'm going to close the chat because it's going to be back sitting."
2886560,2888000," So, I'm going to be trying to do that."
2888000,2891760," So, yeah."
2891760,2902560," Essentially, what's the frequency of the base"
2902560,2903600," a sound?"
2903600,2904240," Like, I forgot."
2904240,2907840," It's something 448."
2907840,2908240," Yeah."
2908240,2908400," Yeah."
2908400,2910000," It's just 4.8 or hertz."
2910000,2915280," It's kind of insane how Google is just like, yeah, useless for all of that."
2915280,2921840," So, this is how many times you have to repeat the period per second."
2921840,2922080," Right."
2922080,2924960," So, this is how many times you have to repeat the period per second."
2926480,2934960," So, interestingly, what we want to do, we want to maybe iterate each individual sample in here."
2934960,2936240," Right."
2936240,2944480," So, that means I'm going to be going from 0 to maybe the entirety of the length."
2944480,2944800," Right."
2944800,2946720," So, this is basically the length."
2946720,2949440," This is the, like, sort of the sound that we're going to be generating."
2949440,2955600," And so, we can actually transform this value from..."
2958080,2958240," Yeah."
2958240,2958320," Yeah."
2958320,2960320," So, we can divide it by length."
2960320,2961200," Right."
2961200,2963040," So, this is basically what we do."
2963040,2964320," We divide it by length."
2964320,2969360," And that gives us value from 0 to 1 within the second."
2969360,2970160," Right."
2970160,2972160," So, it's sort of like a normalized value."
2972160,2974080," Maybe I'm going to put it like S."
2974080,2974320," Right."
2974320,2975680," So, this is basically S."
2975680,2981200," So, we can put that straight into the cosine."
2981200,2981440," Right."
2981440,2983120," So, this is straight into the cosine."
2983120,2987440," But that is not a single period per second."
2987440,2989920," A single period per second is going to be 2 pi."
2989920,2990480," Right."
2990480,2991920," So, it's basically math 2 pi."
2991920,2998320," A single period of cosine is going to be from 0 to 2 pi."
2998320,3000960," And that's why we're multiplying it like that."
3002160,3003680," That's why we're multiplying it like that."
3003680,3009760," If we want to actually do that several times per second,"
3009760,3015440," I suppose we have to divide it by this thing."
3015440,3016720," Right."
3016720,3018160," And that's going to be our sample."
3018160,3022400," But that sample is actually from minus 1 to 1."
3022400,3026320," And I don't remember if the samples are allowed in the audio buffer,"
3026320,3027360," but maybe they are."
3027360,3029280," Right."
3029280,3031200," So, maybe it's from minus 1 to 1."
3032000,3032240," Right."
3032240,3034560," So, this one."
3034560,3034800," Yeah."
3034800,3035840," So, it should be fine."
3035840,3036640," Let me see."
3036640,3039920," Like, I probably fucked up somewhere here, but I'm not sure if I care."
3039920,3042960," I think it's totally fine if I fuck up."
3042960,3044240," All right."
3044240,3045680," So, everything seems to be compiling."
3045680,3048480," And I'm going to try to maybe refresh this entire thing."
3048480,3049680," And I'm going to click in here."
3049680,3050960," Right."
3050960,3054240," So, do we have anything within the buffer?"
3054240,3055040," We didn't even..."
3055040,3056080," So, yeah."
3056080,3057280," We copied some stuff."
3057280,3058720," But, I mean, that's about it."
3059680,3060160," All right."
3060160,3064640," So, when I created the buffer source, how do I assign a buffer to it?"
3064640,3066720," Do I just assign that buffer there?"
3066720,3067840," Right."
3067840,3068880," So, buffer source."
3068880,3071200," Buffer source."
3071200,3071760," Buffer."
3071760,3072240," Buffer."
3072240,3073200," Can I just assign it?"
3073200,3074640," It's not read-only."
3074640,3075600," Right."
3075600,3076240," I suppose."
3076240,3079520," It's funny how it doesn't accept any parameters in here."
3079520,3080480," All right."
3080480,3082160," It doesn't accept any parameters."
3082160,3083280," Maybe it doesn't even need to."
3083280,3083520," Right."
3083520,3086080," So, it goes off of the just buffer."
3086080,3087760," Right."
3087760,3089280," It goes off of that just buffer."
3089280,3095040," By the way, I think I should not be dividing it."
3096000,3099120," I feel I should be, like, basically multiplying it."
3099120,3101120," Yeah."
3101120,3102640," Because it will speed it up."
3102640,3105440," I think I should be multiplying the chat."
3105440,3105680," Yeah."
3105680,3106800," I think I should be multiplying it."
3106800,3108480," All right."
3108480,3109440," Because it makes..."
3109440,3111440," It will make it go faster."
3111440,3111920," Yeah."
3111920,3112880," It should be multiplication."
3112880,3114880," All right."
3114880,3116320," So, this is the buffer source."
3116320,3127360," And then what I want to do, I want to actually connect buffer source to audio context."
3127360,3134000," Audio context destination."
3134000,3136480," Then we're going to resume."
3136480,3143440," And since we were playing the blast play, what we have to play now instead is the buffer source."
3144000,3145280," But doesn't have a play."
3145280,3147120," How?"
3147120,3147360," Like..."
3147360,3151520," Do I play the buffer instead then?"
3151520,3153840," How do I fucking play?"
3153840,3154960," Wait."
3154960,3162960," Start?"
3171520,3172240," Web devs."
3172240,3173760," Are you okay?"
3173760,3184160," No."
3184160,3184400," Okay."
3184400,3186080," Understandable, actually."
3186080,3187760," I'm not okay either."
3187760,3191440," It's fine."
3191440,3192000," It's fine."
3192000,3193440," It's a crazy world we're living in."
3193440,3194320," Everything's going to be fine."
3194320,3196720," Right."
3196720,3198560," So, I suppose that's okay."
3198560,3201200," Everything seems to be compiling."
3201200,3202960," Everything seems to be in order."
3202960,3207760," I'm not putting on any headphones because I want to protect my ears."
3207760,3209600," I don't care about your ears though."
3209600,3212640," So, we're going to actually crank up the volume."
3212640,3214560," I'm joking, but we're not going to do that."
3214560,3216320," All right."
3216320,3217440," So, let's actually refresh."
3218080,3218960," And..."
3218960,3222560," Did I fucking first try this shit?"
3222560,3228880," I completely..."
3228880,3232000," I don't remember any theory about the music."
3232000,3234640," And I just like figured it out from the bass principle."
3235680,3237200," I really fucking frustrated."
3237200,3237920," Holy shit."
3237920,3242320," GG's."
3242320,3243520," Literally GG's."
3243520,3244240," Holy shit."
3244240,3246560," My god."
3246560,3248720," Let's fucking go."
3248720,3255440," Wait."
3255440,3258160," It was actually..."
3258160,3258880," It went higher."
3258880,3260960," It was probably actually rewriting this shit."
3260960,3261200," Okay."
3261200,3261520," I see."
3261520,3264720," We can do something interesting now."
3264720,3268720," We can do like a scale."
3268720,3269920," Right."
3269920,3271600," So, essentially length."
3271600,3272400," We can say, okay."
3272400,3277280," A play may be several nodes per second."
3277280,3277520," Right."
3277520,3280400," So, we can introduce something like nodes."
3280400,3282240," And we're going to have seven nodes."
3282240,3282400," Right."
3282400,3283520," So, this is a seven nodes."
3283520,3288160," That means the length is going to be sample rate divided by nodes."
3289040,3291520," And interestingly in here."
3291520,3293760," Interestingly in here."
3293760,3294720," You..."
3294720,3296480," So, this is basically the second."
3296480,3298080," Like, this is the current second."
3298080,3300640," Maybe because of that I should have actually called it time."
3300640,3300960," Right."
3300960,3302720," So, this is basically the time."
3302720,3306640," And we play in different nodes per second."
3306640,3312400," So, that means the current node is floor T."
3312400,3315840," That's the current node that we're currently playing."
3317200,3317600," Right."
3317600,3319440," So, this is the current node."
3319440,3325040," And this is going to be like a A 448."
3325040,3325840," Right."
3325840,3327440," So, I'm going to put this thing in here."
3327440,3328400," A 448."
3328400,3331360," Maybe it's not a good thing to call it."
3331360,3333360," Let's call it base node."
3333360,3333680," Right."
3333680,3336560," So, not even base node."
3336560,3339520," But base node frequency."
3339520,3341040," Maybe HZ."
3341040,3341360," Right."
3342640,3343840," Base node frequency."
3343840,3346880," And right."
3346880,3349040," Since this is the current node."
3349040,3351600," We can probably compute node frequency."
3351600,3352800," I don't remember."
3352800,3356000," Like, if you want to find the next node."
3356000,3356240," Right."
3356240,3357760," So, if you want to find the next node."
3357760,3360720," What you have to do."
3360720,3361200," You have to."
3361200,3361680," Yeah."
3361680,3361920," Thank you."
3361920,3362240," Thank you."
3362240,3362480," Thank you."
3362480,3362720," Thank you."
3362720,3363680," Thank you."
3363680,3363920," Yes."
3363920,3364160," Yes."
3364160,3364240," Yes."
3364240,3364400," Yes."
3364400,3364640," Yes."
3364640,3364880," Yes."
3364880,3364880," Yes."
3364880,3367040," I do remember that it is weird like that."
3367040,3369520," You have to just multiply it."
3369520,3370560," Yeah."
3370560,3370720," Yeah."
3370720,3370880," Yeah."
3370880,3371280," Yeah."
3371280,3371760," Yeah."
3371760,3374080," Chad, stop saying things."
3374080,3375200," I want to copy paint."
3375200,3380320," By the way, I think I can go to YouTube."
3380320,3381360," Right."
3381360,3384240," And find, you know, music in Haskell."
3384240,3387280," Reject all."
3387280,3389440," I'm rejecting you."
3389440,3392320," Music in Haskell."
3392320,3396960," I'm the only one who did that."
3398000,3402800," Chonkitsodin."
3402800,3404080," It's a me."
3404080,3408480," So, if you want to, if you want to actually watch that, you can do it in here."
3408480,3410880," All right."
3410880,3415200," So, and I'm going to put that stuff in the description for anyone who wants to watch that."
3415200,3420000," Because, like, I already did this kind of stuff before in Haskell."
3420000,3421680," So, I remember the theory."
3421680,3421920," Right."
3421920,3423920," I remember the theory."
3423920,3425600," Thick Zodin."
3426240,3426800," Extra."
3426800,3431760," So, I put a link in here to, like, a theory."
3431760,3440080," This is, like, okay, jokes aside."
3440080,3441920," Like, I'm not even fucking joking."
3441920,3443840," Internet is dying."
3446560,3448080," Like, this is fucking sad."
3448080,3456000," Literally, internet is dying."
3456000,3457360," We're losing the internet."
3457360,3462880," Internet archive and shit like that."
3462880,3465040," And web archive."
3465040,3467360," So, people actually saw Omnicalculator."
3467360,3468160," No, no, no."
3468160,3470000," There was a page that was explaining."
3470000,3471600," MTU."
3471600,3473600," Like, is that MTU?"
3473600,3475200," Or was that MIT?"
3475200,3476480," Maybe I actually misspelled."
3476480,3478400," I hope I misspelled it."
3480720,3483680," So, let me try to."
3483680,3486080," Maybe I can just Google for this thing."
3486080,3494720," Okay."
3494720,3495920," So, there's a copy."
3495920,3498000," There's a copy of that."
3498000,3499600," But it's not exactly that page."
3499600,3502800," It's really fucking sad."
3504800,3506320," So, internet died some time ago."
3506320,3506720," Yeah."
3506720,3509040," So, you really need to archive things."
3509040,3509280," Right."
3509280,3512320," So, you see an important page where you read something."
3512320,3514480," You better fucking download that page, honestly."
3514480,3515680," Right."
3515680,3519600," I think the time has come when, like, you stumble upon useful information on the internet."
3519600,3522640," Fucking download it on your machine and archive it somewhere."
3522640,3524240," Right."
3524240,3528560," So, because we don't fucking know if we're going to have internet in, like, in 10 years or something."
3528560,3534000," So, like, with YouTube videos, if you like a video, yeah, deal it."
3534640,3535520," Well, honestly."
3535520,3536560," Honestly, deal it."
3536560,3543520," Because I feel like in several decades, what we're going to be doing is recovering the lost data"
3543520,3548240," from different pieces, from different hard drives of people who managed to actually archive things."
3548240,3549280," Right."
3549280,3552480," Because the whole infrastructure is slowly actually falling apart."
3552480,3555280," So, yeah."
3555280,3559840," The internet archive is getting DDoS right now."
3559840,3561280," Is it still DDoSed?"
3561280,3564480," So, as far as I know, apart from being DDoSed, it was also"
3565440,3566320," really pwned."
3566320,3566560," Right."
3566560,3570560," So, the hackers getting access to the, you know, to the database and stuff like that."
3570560,3571280," It's fully hacked."
3571280,3572880," Right."
3572880,3580400," And I suppose by DDoS is that they just, like, turned it off because it's fully pwned."
3580400,3591200," So, anyways, anyways, anyways, anyways, anyways."
3591200,3592240," Right."
3592240,3593760," So, this is the page I wanted to do."
3593760,3599360," And we already know that we have to basically multiply this thing by that, which is approximately..."
3599360,3601200," And, like, I still don't have Boomer, right?"
3601200,3605040," Because Boomer doesn't work on my new laptop for whatever reason."
3605040,3606240," It's not really about the laptop."
3606240,3607200," It's about the setup."
3607200,3608960," Something is not working right."
3608960,3609920," Right."
3609920,3611280," So, you just, like, multiply."
3611280,3616400," To get the next node, you have to multiply the frequency by that weird value."
3616400,3617920," Right."
3617920,3620640," So, how do you call it that value?"
3620640,3621760," Let's call it semitone."
3621760,3623600," I think that's a good name for that stuff."
3623600,3625360," Right."
3625360,3627760," So, semitone."
3627760,3629680," So, that's the value."
3629680,3635840," So, and maybe we can just call it node frequency."
3635840,3641600," And I don't freaking know."
3646640,3649120," So, I don't know, man."
3649120,3649600," I don't know."
3649600,3653200," So, what's the easiest way to do that?"
3653200,3659920," Maybe the easiest way to do that would be to still have base node frequency."
3659920,3660880," Right."
3660880,3666720," So, you do base node frequency multiplied by semitone, which gives you the next thing."
3666720,3669360," And then you do math power."
3669360,3675600," You get it to the power of the current node, which is basically the floor of T,"
3675600,3677440," because this is how we compute the time."
3677440,3678160," Right."
3678160,3679200," So, this is the current node."
3679200,3682640," Then you're going to have the next node, next node, and so on and so forth."
3682640,3687920," And this is basically node HZ, like so."
3687920,3689200," And this is node HZ."
3689200,3690560," So, that's the easiest way to do that."
3692240,3699280," But at the same time, yeah, it's easier to do it this way because it's stateless in a sense."
3699280,3699520," Right."
3699520,3704960," You can just compute the node frequency just purely based on the index of the current sample."
3704960,3705760," Right."
3705760,3707840," So, it's kind of cool that it's stateless like that."
3708400,3711440," So, in here we have seven semitones."
3711440,3716160," But if we want to play full octave, right, it's actually 12 semitones as far as I know."
3716160,3716400," Right."
3716400,3718160," So, it's 12 semitones."
3718160,3719360," Anyways."
3719360,3720800," So, everything seems to be compiling."
3720800,3721280," All right."
3721280,3723200," And let's actually refresh this syntactic."
3723200,3726320," And come here, shit."
3726320,3731360," Okay."
3731360,3734160," I apologize for base."
3734160,3736640," All right."
3736640,3737840," So, that was bizarre."
3737840,3739440," I wonder what the fuck has happened."
3739440,3745040," So, yeah."
3745040,3749120," The thing I don't want to do, honestly, for heresy."
3749120,3757920," The thing that I wanted, I would expect it to be just like if it's zero and it could be zero."
3757920,3759120," So, it's going to be just one."
3759920,3763520," So, that was kind of bizarre, honestly."
3763520,3765520," I don't know what the fuck has happened there."
3765520,3766480," Dubstep string."
3766480,3768960," Right."
3768960,3770080," So, that was kind of bizarre."
3770080,3778000," Something broken and I don't understand what."
3778000,3784720," It's because I have to divide it not by the length frequency."
3784720,3786080," I apologize."
3786080,3789440," I hope like it was not too damaging to the ears."
3789440,3793600," I should have actually divided by the rate."
3793600,3793840," Right."
3793840,3795760," So, I should divide it by sample rate."
3795760,3797040," So, that's what I should have done."
3797040,3798400," Damn."
3798400,3799440," I'm a dummy dum-dum."
3799440,3800320," Right."
3800320,3803360," Because that just created like a very low frequency."
3803360,3804480," I really apologize for that."
3805600,3806400," Okay."
3806400,3809040," So, let me let me do that and..."
3809040,3812320," Am I deaf?"
3812320,3812720," You..."
3812720,3813120," I don't know."
3813120,3816320," Okay."
3816320,3823200," So, let me now just bring back this thing"
3823200,3836000," and that should create something cool."
3836000,3842320," That's really cool."
3842320,3842560," Right."
3842560,3844800," So, we just played all the 12 notes of the octave."
3847040,3847520," Damn."
3847520,3850640," It feels good to be actually competent."
3850640,3851920," Right."
3851920,3855760," You know how at the beginning they said,"
3855760,3860880," ""Oh, the application programming interface might be confusing for the developers""."
3860880,3862160," Damn."
3862160,3863200," It's good to be competent."
3863200,3867840," Just to understand the field you're working with."
3867840,3869760," So, you're not confused with shit."
3870960,3871520," But anyway."
3871520,3873760," Anyway, anyway, anyway."
3873760,3874800," So, this is pretty cool."
3874800,3879840," Scaled, ratioed and stuff like that."
3879840,3882080," So, that means..."
3882080,3886880," What if I want to play several sounds simultaneously?"
3886880,3889840," It's a really interesting question."
3889840,3892880," How can I play several sounds simultaneously?"
3892880,3896480," Time for Turing machine."
3896480,3897520," Oh yeah, probably."
3899120,3901600," So, maybe..."
3901600,3904880," So, if I don't want to mix things."
3904880,3905760," Right."
3905760,3909040," I suppose I create several sources."
3909040,3909280," Right."
3909280,3910560," I create several sources."
3910560,3913600," And just play them simultaneously."
3913600,3915840," But what if I want to play the same sound"
3915840,3917920," several times simultaneously?"
3917920,3920080," Do I create several sources of the same sound?"
3920080,3922640," Click twice."
3922640,3924400," Oh."
3924400,3924960," Well, yeah."
3924960,3926080," That actually creates"
3926880,3929440," several audio contexts."
3929440,3931760," Right."
3931760,3933440," Several contexts."
3933440,3934000," Okay."
3934000,3936000," So, that's pretty cool."
3936000,3937440," You know what I want to do?"
3937440,3939200," I want to kind of like factor out"
3939200,3944320," the generation of the samples."
3944320,3945280," Right."
3945280,3949360," So, let's say I want to do something like generate tone."
3950240,3950800," Right."
3950800,3953760," You provide the buffer into..."
3953760,3955120," Let's call it samples, maybe."
3955120,3956560," Right."
3956560,3958560," So, it's going to be float32 array."
3958560,3961200," Float32 array."
3961200,3964480," And you also have to provide the sample rate."
3964480,3964800," Right."
3964800,3967440," So, sample rate is going to be very important."
3967440,3968160," It's going to be number."
3968160,3973920," So, length is essentially going to be just the length of the buffer that you allocated."
3973920,3974080," Right."
3974080,3975440," It's going to be purely up to you."
3976000,3979120," And also, you have the frequency."
3979120,3979280," Right."
3979280,3982240," So, you specify at which frequency you want to generate the tone."
3982240,3985040," And in here, we're going to be just doing that."
3985040,3988480," Simply doing that."
3988480,3991040," So, iterate."
3991040,3993200," But we're iterating actually samples length."
3993200,3994080," Right."
3994080,3995280," Does it have a..."
3995280,3995840," It has a..."
3995840,4001520," Not really byte length, but just length."
4001520,4001680," Yeah."
4001680,4002720," It does have byte length."
4002720,4003280," Just length."
4003280,4007280," So, here is the frequency that we have."
4007280,4007520," Right."
4007520,4009680," So, that's basically the frequency."
4009680,4011680," Right."
4011680,4013280," And we can just like pull it in here."
4013280,4015600," So, this is hz and this is samples."
4015600,4018480," So, that's what we have in here."
4018480,4018720," Right."
4018720,4020320," You can generate a tone."
4020320,4022000," Right."
4022000,4024560," And then we can maybe generate a note."
4024560,4025760," Right."
4025760,4030080," So, we can basically build upon this function to generate a note."
4030080,4032640," Function generate note."
4032640,4036560," So, provide the samples float 32."
4036560,4038720," Sample rate, by the way, as well."
4038720,4041600," And note is going to be just a number."
4041600,4044560," Let's call it semitone."
4045120,4046960," Because that's going to be more accurate."
4046960,4048000," Uh, sem..."
4048000,4049120," Semi-tone."
4049120,4050800," Uh-huh."
4050800,4052240," Semi-tone."
4052240,4054560," All right."
4054560,4057520," Zero is going to be, uh, 440 hertz."
4057520,4057840," Right."
4057840,4060880," So, zero is going to be just this base note thingy."
4060880,4062640," Um..."
4062640,4065600," So, I'm going to just grab this entire stuff."
4067440,4072400," And the way we're going to be generating is generate tone for samples and sample rate."
4072400,4076000," Uh, and a semitone is just basically..."
4076000,4078400," Uh, 440."
4078400,4078880," I don't know."
4078880,4080240," Maybe we don't even have to do that."
4080240,4082160," Um, so..."
4082160,4085520," Math power."
4085520,4087200," Math power."
4087200,4090080," Uh, 1 to 12."
4091120,4095120," Oh, we didn't have to do that in JavaScript because it's, like, uh, it always floats."
4095120,4097520," To the power of the semitone."
4097520,4098640," Did I get that correctly?"
4098640,4101760," I think I did, in fact, get that correctly."
4101760,4102640," So, that's pretty cool."
4102640,4104720," So, that's what we have in here."
4104720,4106560," So, generate semitone."
4106560,4108000," And we can now use that."
4108000,4110640," So, the cool thing about, uh, float 32 array."
4110640,4115040," I think we can get slices and sub arrays of this entire stuff."
4115040,4116720," Can we actually do that?"
4116720,4116880," Right."
4116880,4119920," So, because, for instance, I want to generate, like, N nodes."
4119920,4122160," I can take my, uh, my track."
4122160,4124800," Split it into sections."
4124800,4126320," Slice those sections."
4126320,4127280," Right."
4127280,4128000," Slice those sections."
4128000,4128960," It's 2 to the power."
4128960,4129440," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
4129440,4130880," Um."
4130880,4134800," Oh, yeah."
4134800,4136240," Because it's a, it's a value."
4136240,4139520," Semi-tone is this."
4139520,4139840," Okay."
4139840,4140320," Yeah, yeah."
4140320,4141280," It's that one."
4141280,4145520," So, it's this multiplied by this."
4145520,4146960," Uh, right."
4146960,4147920," Multiply by this."
4147920,4149680," Uh-huh."
4149920,4152800," And then."
4152800,4156880," Am I, am I going crazy?"
4156880,4157840," I think I'm going crazy."
4157840,4159120," That's what it has to be."
4159120,4160640," All right."
4160640,4165600," Like, here, I called semitone the coefficient by which I have to multiply."
4165600,4168080," Here, I called semitone the index of the semi."
4168080,4168880," Oh, my God."
4168880,4170480," I just literally confused myself."
4170480,4172480," All right."
4172480,4173680," So, everything's fine."
4175520,4176880," I just literally confused myself."
4176880,4178240," Uh, so what I was talking about."
4178240,4182960," I was talking about, uh, the, um, you know, slicing things."
4182960,4185280," Slicing things around."
4185280,4185600," All right."
4185600,4187200," So, you need to generate some nodes."
4187200,4191360," You can just, like, take a slice of the samples and you can generate some nodes."
4192080,4192960," Um, right."
4192960,4193760," All right."
4193760,4197440," And the question is, how do I slice float32 array?"
4197440,4198320," Does anybody know?"
4198320,4199440," Like, is it just slice?"
4204400,4205920," Who needs rust?"
4205920,4209360," Who needs go if you have based JavaScript?"
4209360,4209840," Am I right?"
4209840,4212800," So, you can just slice erase."
4212800,4213360," Erase."
4213360,4215120," Um, right."
4215120,4217120," So, this one is not really needed."
4217120,4219920," Base node or none of that is really needed."
4219920,4223520," Um, so this is the nodes."
4223520,4224720," This is the length."
4224720,4227840," So, and the length is going to be just that."
4227840,4231200," What I want to do is essentially just four."
4232720,4236560," Um, you know, node starting from zero."
4236560,4239360," Uh, node less than nodes."
4239360,4240560," Plus plus node."
4240560,4240880," Right."
4240880,4241520," Something like that."
4241520,4245360," So, then I want to take a slice like per second."
4245360,4245600," Right."
4245600,4248240," So, because we're playing a semitone per second."
4248240,4250000," Uh, semitone per second."
4250000,4254480," So, that means I want to do, um, you know, source slice."
4254480,4256880," So, the slice accepts start and end."
4256880,4262080," That means, uh, so a single second."
4262080,4262480," All right."
4262480,4263520," A single second."
4263520,4267920," So, we're starting from node."
4267920,4275360," Sample rate multiplied by node."
4275360,4276960," That's where it starts."
4276960,4282240," And then what we have in here is the node plus one."
4282240,4283040," And this is the end."
4283040,4284560," But does it include the end?"
4284560,4286880," The end of the specified portion of the array."
4286880,4288000," This is exclusive."
4288000,4288240," Okay."
4288240,4289600," So, it doesn't include the end."
4289600,4291200," Uh, right."
4291200,4292960," So, that's the thing we want to have in here."
4292960,4298240," And we can generate node for this entire thing for that specific sample rate."
4298240,4300000," And what kind of node we want to generate?"
4300000,4301920," We want to generate like the node in here."
4301920,4303280," Uh, right."
4303280,4305600," So, generate semitone."
4305600,4306080," Right."
4306080,4307280," So, my turn."
4307280,4308960," Okay."
4308960,4311280," So, that's, this is how simple it is."
4311280,4311440," Right."
4311440,4313680," So, we have a bigger track."
4313680,4316240," We're splitting that track into specific nodes."
4316240,4321360," And we're generating different semitones into these specific chunks, into these specific nodes."
4321360,4325760," So, we have like a larger building block, so to speak."
4325760,4332160," What's interesting is that we can actually, we don't have to really generate that exact node."
4332160,4334640," We can shift it by maybe 10, right?"
4334640,4338320," So, now the sequence is going to be a little bit higher."
4338320,4345680," Or maybe we can actually generate them by full tones."
4345680,4348160," Actually, we can just multiply by two."
4348160,4350720," Well, let's actually generate full tones because I think it's going to be interesting."
4352320,4352560," Right."
4352560,4355440," So, this is like a full tones."
4355440,4356960," All right."
4356960,4358960," So, everything seems to be compiling."
4358960,4361520," And let me now open."
4361520,4362240," Listen, I think."
4362240,4362640," And listen."
4362640,4365360," You can hear shit in this mist."
4365360,4368240," Did a fucky walky."
4368240,4373680," So, I don't fucking know what happened, brother."
4373680,4375760," I don't fucking know."
4375760,4377040," So, why didn't work?"
4381360,4385680," I didn't see any problem, honestly."
4385680,4386880," Right away."
4386880,4391040," I hate it when it's just like, fuck you."
4391040,4393760," So, slice makes a..."
4393760,4394480," Fuck off."
4394480,4397600," Fuck off."
4397600,4399360," Really return a section of..."
4399360,4404000," Web devs."
4404000,4421440," Because it's going to be too confusing for the developers when you make a slice."
4422080,4425840," And you may define one slice, but it also modifies the original."
4425840,4428560," It's too confusing for our developers."
4428560,4430640," We can't allow that because of that it's a copy."
4430640,4432720," Because of that it's a copy."
4435360,4437120," Oh, bro."
4437120,4439200," Okay, okay."
4439200,4441200," Is there any way to take a view on that?"
4441200,4444000," Sub-orane."
4444000,4450080," Okay, it's okay."
4450080,4459360," All right, all right, all right."
4459360,4472560," It also clips a little bit because of that."
4472560,4480560," That's pretty cool."
4480560,4482480," Cheers."
4483280,4487280," So, the cool thing about like tonal sequence, right?"
4487280,4491280," So, full-tone sequence is that it sounds kind of magical in a sense, doesn't it?"
4491280,4497280," Sounds like a hearing test right there, yeah."
4497280,4499600," Blue scale now."
4499600,4502240," Maybe I don't really know blue scale."
4502240,4503200," I'm not competent enough."
4503200,4507520," Motherboard test, exactly."
4507520,4508640," Exactly, exactly, exactly."
4508640,4510320," So, we can now do these kind of things."
4511760,4515200," Which is kind of cool, which is kind of based."
4515200,4518880," It's all about that based."
4518880,4522080," So, what else can we do?"
4522080,4525920," All right."
4525920,4530560," So, if I have two sounds, how can I play them simultaneously?"
4530560,4532000," So, number of channels, notes."
4532000,4535760," Let's say that we're going to have one second."
4539440,4542880," And the thing I want to do, right."
4542880,4544000," I'm generating."
4544000,4547440," So, generate doesn't return anything."
4547440,4550480," Maybe we should make it return that float thingy."
4550480,4552960," Because I think it's kind of useful, right?"
4552960,4555440," It generates that and instantly returns that."
4555440,4557120," And so does the generate tone."
4557120,4558560," Right."
4558560,4559760," So, we simply return."
4559760,4561840," Is there a way?"
4561840,4562080," Okay."
4562080,4566000," I kind of vaguely remember that you can say that it returns samples."
4566560,4567760," Nah, you can't do that."
4567760,4568800," Right."
4568800,4571280," So, but I mean, I kind of vaguely remember that you could do that."
4571280,4572960," Right."
4572960,4574720," So, I don't even know."
4574720,4580320," Is it going to work?"
4580320,4580960," Nah, I don't know."
4580960,4583920," Type of samples."
4587520,4587840," Yeah."
4587840,4588400," But this."
4588400,4593440," You're going to document that it returns exactly that same thing."
4593440,4594400," Right."
4594400,4597520," So, that's basically what you're documenting here."
4597520,4599200," That's actually kind of cool."
4599200,4603360," Because if you change the type of the samples, you don't have to change it in the second place in here."
4603360,4608000," But in any case, it's going to, the compiler is going to warn you anyway if the type has changed."
4608000,4609280," So, it's not that big of a deal."
4609280,4611040," Right."
4611040,4613200," So, it's not that big of a deal."
4613200,4614640," But I mean, it's kind of cool."
4614640,4618720," It's not like I'm going to be maintaining this piece of code for a long amount of time."
4618720,4622320," And I have to, like, actually write something readable."
4622320,4622800," Right."
4622800,4626960," So, I don't even write readable code for the shit that I maintain for a long time."
4626960,4629840," But anyway."
4631520,4633040," So, we have one buffer."
4633040,4633440," Right."
4633440,4635280," So, buffer one."
4635280,4636320," So, this is that thing."
4636320,4642240," And after that, what I do is that I just create the length."
4642240,4649760," And I generate a semitone, semitone for this thing at that exact sample rate."
4649760,4653040," And semitone is the zeroth semitone."
4653040,4659600," And then I basically copy, right, buffer, copy to channel like this."
4660640,4661040," All right."
4661040,4663040," So, that's what we do in here."
4663040,4664640," And this is actually buffer one."
4664640,4665680," Right."
4665680,4668080," That's how we operate in here."
4668080,4669760," When I copy it to channel, does it return?"
4669760,4670720," It doesn't return anything."
4670720,4670960," Okay."
4670960,4673040," So, it's sort of stateful like that."
4673040,4677920," So, then I can copy paste this and that thing and say this is buffer two."
4677920,4678960," This is buffer two."
4678960,4683520," And let's say that this one is going to be like five or whatever."
4683520,4685120," So, that's a different semitone."
4686400,4690320," After that, I can create buffer maybe one source."
4690320,4690720," Right."
4690720,4692880," So, this is going to be buffer one source."
4692880,4693920," And this is buffer one."
4693920,4697200," And this one is going to be actually buffer two."
4697200,4699760," So, buffer one, buffer two."
4700800,4707040," And I suppose after that I'm connecting buffer one to the destination, buffer two to the destination."
4707040,4709120," Well, that's..."
4709120,4711680," I should have actually put one and two at the end."
4711680,4712480," All right."
4712480,4713840," So, because that kind of makes sense."
4713840,4717120," That kind of makes things maybe easier for me."
4717120,4720160," I'm not really sure."
4720160,4721760," I'm not really sure."
4721760,4722480," But we'll see."
4722480,4722960," We'll see."
4722960,4725600," Source one starts."
4725600,4726800," Source two starts."
4726800,4729760," So, if I want to play them simultaneously."
4729760,4731280," Is it going to work?"
4731280,4732400," Is it going to work?"
4732400,4736160," All right."
4736160,4737040," So, let's go."
4737040,4739040," Mm-hmm."
4739040,4745840," That was interesting."
4745840,4749200," All right."
4749200,4752320," So, what if I don't copy anything?"
4752320,4753760," Right."
4753760,4755360," Don't create the second sound."
4755360,4756800," Is it going to work now?"
4756800,4758880," Okay."
4758880,4760080," That seems fine."
4760080,4762480," All right."
4762480,4763600," One."
4763600,4767920," One, two, three, four."
4768800,4770080," Five, six."
4770080,4772400," So, I think it has to be something like seven."
4772400,4774000," Seventh semitone."
4774000,4778320," If I want to do quinta, I think."
4778320,4781440," First, third, fifth."
4781440,4782000," Yeah."
4782000,4782880," So, it's about like..."
4782880,4785600," Well, I mean, essentially..."
4785600,4787520," Try it."
4791600,4793280," Let's see if it's going to do..."
4793280,4797760," It doesn't sound right."
4797760,4800000," I don't even hear shit."
4800000,4801840," Just a second."
4801840,4802320," I want to be..."
4802320,4804640," Yeah."
4804640,4806000," It looks like shit."
4806000,4809600," It looks like shit."
4809600,4811440," Sounds like shit."
4811440,4812960," I'm not really sure why, though."
4814720,4816640," If I try something like this."
4816640,4817920," All right."
4817920,4818880," Only a single one."
4818880,4822160," They don't mix well."
4822160,4827200," I only hear them mixing."
4827200,4830240," Do you guys hear them mixing?"
4836240,4837440," Offset of wave."
4837440,4840800," Am I modifying offset of wave?"
4840800,4842080," I don't think so, actually."
4842080,4843200," Generate semitone."
4843200,4846000," So, yeah."
4846000,4847920," If I have two buffer sources,"
4847920,4850400," they don't mix well."
4850400,4854480," Do I have to use something to mix them, actually?"
4857280,4860320," Just sounds like one, at least on my speakers."
4860320,4862000," I don't know what you're talking about."
4862000,4863280," So, zero, two, four."
4863280,4865040," I don't understand what you guys are talking about."
4865040,4867440," This is not the problem that I'm having right now."
4867440,4869040," So, I suppose..."
4869040,4870640," Yeah."
4870640,4871520," Modifying sound."
4871520,4872480," You can modify sound."
4872480,4873440," You can create gain."
4873440,4875280," And..."
4875280,4878160," How do I mix?"
4878160,4879520," Adding stereo panning."
4879520,4882640," Okay."
4882640,4883440," Track, connect."
4883440,4884960," This is actually kind of cool."
4884960,4886960," So, you can chain connects together."
4888000,4888320," Right."
4888320,4891440," So, you have track, gain node, panner,"
4891440,4893920," and something like that."
4893920,4896000," So, it's just like a node modification."
4896000,4898240," So, it's sort of like shaders, but for audio."
4898240,4901360," Imagine if we wrote like shaders, but for the sound cards."
4901360,4906000," But for the sound cards."
4906000,4907120," That would be kind of cool, I think."
4907120,4910320," So, you can also have visualization."
4910320,4912880," You did assign only one channel."
4912880,4913440," So, what?"
4913440,4916080," So, what?"
4917280,4919360," I don't understand."
4919360,4926640," I don't want to play one buffer in one channel and second buffer in another channel."
4926640,4927520," I want to mix them."
4927520,4929440," What are you guys talking about?"
4929440,4932320," Channels is like a different, like left channel, right channel."
4932320,4933440," It's like when you have to like..."
4933440,4937360," This has nothing to do with channels."
4937360,4938560," Calm down, guys."
4938560,4938960," Come on."
4938960,4943680," Number of channels in buffer."
4946880,4947440," All right."
4947440,4950720," So, what do we have?"
4950720,4951360," Close in the chat."
4951360,4953360," How do I mix?"
4953360,4953760," All right."
4953760,4954640," So, mix."
4954640,4958160," So, there's no way to mix."
4958160,4959120," That's bizarre."
4959120,4961840," Create source buffer."
4962960,4964480," Audio destination."
4964480,4965280," Audio that."
4965280,4969440," So, audio mix."
4969440,4977360," So, in fact, sound files are just recording and sound intensify, which comes in from microphone"
4977360,4980320," and lecture and get mixed into a single complicated wave."
4981440,4981840," Mixing."
4981840,4983360," Partitional audio and WebGL."
4983360,4986400," Mixed down."
4986400,4988320," All right."
4988320,4993920," I wonder why they don't mix."
4993920,4997120," Maybe it's yet another node that you have to create."
4997120,5000240," It could be just yet another node."
5000240,5002320," But is it part of the audio context?"
5002320,5003280," I don't really know."
5003280,5004320," Audio context."
5004320,5005840," Create."
5005840,5007440," Mix."
5007440,5008240," No."
5008240,5009760," Create."
5010480,5010720," Yeah."
5010720,5011920," So, there is gainer."
5011920,5013760," The thing that does gain."
5013760,5016240," But, yeah."
5016240,5016640," I don't know."
5016640,5018640," Maybe this is how they're supposed to sound."
5018640,5020560," But I actually highly doubt that."
5020560,5023360," Right."
5023360,5024720," I actually highly doubt that."
5024720,5027600," So, grab mix."
5027600,5029120," So, that's not a bad idea, honestly."
5029120,5031360," Maybe that's something I have to do."
5031360,5034560," So, mix."
5034560,5039760," So, it actually gets"
5040480,5041760," one sound."
5041760,5045280," Because if you listen like one sound."
5045280,5045520," Okay."
5045520,5046800," So, this is the first sound."
5046800,5049360," This is the first sound."
5049360,5051280," All right."
5051280,5052080," That makes sense."
5052080,5054240," It's actually not that high."
5054240,5056320," Right."
5056320,5057440," So, this is one sound."
5058240,5062320," And this is the second sound."
5062320,5066560," I'm trying to play both of them simultaneously."
5066560,5070720," And is that how it's supposed to sound?"
5072960,5078640," I actually doubt that this is how they're supposed to sound because it's..."
5078640,5085520," I doubt that."
5086400,5087360," it's interleaved."
5087360,5090400," Technically, this is how they're supposed to sound."
5090400,5093920," But, I mean, that doesn't help."
5093920,5099760," Maybe it will be easier to hear it with one octave."
5099760,5100800," 11 maybe."
5100800,5104880," Let's actually try one octave."
5104880,5105040," All right."
5105040,5107360," So, let's actually listen to them separately."
5107360,5108960," Right."
5108960,5112320," Sure."
5112320,5113840," This is the other one."
5113840,5114960," All right."
5114960,5115920," This is the other one."
5115920,5117920," Okay."
5117920,5120160," So, maybe now together."
5129040,5130640," Maybe half the volume."
5130640,5131680," We can try that."
5131680,5132480," Sure."
5132480,5136800," That's going to be like half of that."
5136800,5143760," Ah, that's a good point."
5143760,5147200," Were they overflowing when they were..."
5147200,5150640," They were probably clipped."
5150640,5158080," So, this one is one off."
5158080,5159200," But somebody said 11."
5159200,5162000," It has to be actually 12 to sound an octave."
5162000,5164560," Holy shit."
5164560,5166800," All right."
5166800,5167680," So, what about seven?"
5167680,5171440," I fucking love it."
5171440,5173120," This is my favorite interval, actually."
5173120,5177120," So, length is going to be five seconds."
5184240,5185600," This is my favorite one, honestly."
5185600,5187120," So, I suppose the thing..."
5187120,5189920," The problem was that, like, they just..."
5189920,5191280," Yeah."
5191280,5192160," They were too loud."
5192160,5193040," Right?"
5193040,5195760," You want to actually generate them at, like, halves or something like that."
5195760,5196720," Yeah."
5196720,5198640," I absolutely fucking love them."
5198640,5200320," I absolutely love them."
5201280,5205440," So, and I suppose, like, another one is just like this one."
5205440,5212560," Yeah."
5212560,5213920," One way I multiply the other one."
5213920,5215280," So, that was kind of the problem."
5215280,5218160," So, I should have not actually used, like, an entire once."
5218160,5219200," So, that's great."
5219200,5219600," Interesting."
5219600,5220720," I learned something, I suppose."
5221600,5222560," Actually, I learned something."
5222560,5227200," Normalize it at the end."
5227200,5228560," Maybe."
5228560,5231040," So, it doesn't really matter, like, what exactly we do with that."
5231040,5231280," Right?"
5231280,5233520," So, I'm just trying to learn the API."
5233520,5235040," Right?"
5235040,5236080," To understand what's going on."
5236080,5241760," So, if I have one sort of..."
5244640,5245440," one second."
5245440,5246560," Right?"
5246560,5247760," If I have one second."
5247760,5251120," I need to, like..."
5251120,5255440," One of the use cases that I have in my game,"
5255440,5257200," one of the use cases that I have in the game,"
5257200,5260240," is that I need to play samples when some event occurs."
5260240,5262480," For example, explosion, right?"
5262480,5266400," Or the bomb hits the wall and stuff like that."
5266400,5271040," And, for example, if another bomb exploded"
5271040,5274080," while the explosion of the first bomb is still playing,"
5274960,5277840," I want the sound to be interleaving with each other."
5277840,5282080," That's one of the problems that, for example, coil cannot do."
5282080,5284480," That's one of the things I want to be able to do."
5284480,5288560," The question is, how can I do that in the web API?"
5288560,5288880," Right?"
5288880,5293600," So, essentially, if I have one buffer and I'm starting one buffer"
5293600,5299600," like a second time before the previous didn't stop playing,"
5299600,5303120," will they be interleaving?"
5303840,5306320," Or it's going to be basically restarted?"
5306320,5307520," I think it's going to be restarted."
5307520,5309840," So, overlap."
5309840,5310000," Yeah."
5310000,5311280," So, I want them to be overlapped."
5311280,5313120," So, how do I do that?"
5313120,5313840," That's the question."
5313840,5316000," How can I do that within this single API?"
5316000,5318240," Because, so far, I didn't see how to do that."
5318240,5323120," Because, like, you play per source, right?"
5323120,5326080," And if I restart the same source, it's going to start from scratch."
5326080,5327680," That doesn't make any sense, right?"
5327680,5328560," So, it's kind of weird."
5328560,5333120," So, that's one of the things I want to do."
5333120,5335360," So, this is buffer stats."
5335360,5338640," So, what do we even have in here?"
5339760,5340320," A loop."
5340320,5344560," So, this is the schedule source node."
5344560,5348800," Maybe I need to read about the start."
5349360,5353680," Is there any audio from Wasm or why you are checking out the GS way?"
5356480,5357760," Fucking bait question."
5357760,5358000," Okay."
5358000,5365120," So, schedule sounds to begin playback at the specified time."
5365120,5368240," If no time is specified, then the sound begins playing immediately."
5368240,5375120," This doesn't answer my question, though."
5375120,5377520," This doesn't answer my question."
5377520,5381680," Schedule is a sound to begin playback at specified time."
5385120,5387920," We can just schedule twice."
5387920,5396640," To be fair, the perfectly generated wave is not going to really help us see how it works."
5396640,5400560," We need to go back to blasts."
5400560,5401520," Right."
5401520,5403200," So, we need to go back to blasts."
5403200,5409680," May I maybe factor out all of these experiments into separate functions?"
5409680,5410960," I think it's going to be very useful."
5410960,5412720," Because I don't want to lose any of that stuff."
5413840,5418160," Because it's kind of fun, honestly, doing all of these things."
5418160,5418560," All right."
5418560,5420480," So, yeah."
5420480,5424000," And all of that stuff is going to go to here."
5424000,5428480," Maybe not audio context resuming."
5428480,5430640," Maybe somewhere here."
5433120,5433440," Right."
5433440,5436880," So, in here I suppose I'm going to accept the audio context."
5436880,5440960," Context audio context."
5440960,5442560," Right."
5442560,5445760," So, this entire thing fully compiles as far as you can see."
5445760,5452720," Sound synth demo."
5452720,5452960," Right."
5452960,5454000," So, sound synth demo."
5454000,5457920," I just want to keep it as a function because I may want to go back to that again."
5458560,5459360," All right."
5459360,5461600," So, here I just create a blast sound."
5461600,5467600," Might as well actually move that entire stuff to here."
5467600,5468880," All right."
5468880,5471120," So, this is where we're going to be loading the audios."
5471120,5472800," Audios."
5472800,5474480," All right."
5474480,5475760," So, this is a blast sound."
5477920,5479120," Blast connect."
5479120,5482320," And blast play."
5482320,5484960," But when I'm playing that specific thing."
5484960,5486880," Oh, man."
5486880,5488560," This is so annoying actually that."
5488560,5492640," Yeah."
5492640,5500320," This is really fucking annoying that this thing has a different API."
5500320,5503600," And I was hoping that like played again, but in half of a second."
5503600,5506080," Right."
5506080,5510080," So, and it's just like, can you start instead of play?"
5510080,5510880," I didn't think so."
5510880,5514720," It doesn't have start because it's a different fucking API."
5514720,5517360," Oh, my God."
5517360,5519200," Freaking web."
5525840,5528320," I mean, I can do set timeout essentially."
5528320,5529440," Count time."
5529440,5532480," So, set timeout."
5532480,5534800," Does it fire once?"
5534800,5535440," I don't remember."
5535440,5538080," So, there was a set interval."
5538080,5540880," I think set timeout fires once."
5540880,5541120," Yeah."
5541120,5545440," If you can start the source."
5545440,5547840," You guys are wasting my time."
5547840,5550320," You're again asking questions."
5550320,5553680," And it's just like, it's not what it is."
5553680,5556240," No, you can't."
5556240,5557600," Go away."
5557600,5559680," You're debating me into wasting time."
5559680,5560560," I know what you're doing."
5560560,5561680," I fucking know what you're doing."
5561680,5563200," You're debating me into wasting time."
5563200,5563760," Whatever."
5563760,5565280," Let me focus on what I'm trying to do right now."
5565280,5566560," Okay."
5566560,5568640," So, function reference."
5568640,5569600," Let's actually do that."
5569600,5573200," Maybe it's that function."
5576000,5576800," Let me finish."
5576800,5577200," Okay."
5577200,5577920," Let me finish."
5577920,5579680," Right."
5579680,5580880," So, this is going to be that."
5580880,5582320," And what we're going to do."
5582320,5583440," It's actually milliseconds."
5583440,5585200," So, it's actually milliseconds."
5585200,5588800," So, are they going to be interleaving?"
5588800,5590240," That's the only question I have."
5590240,5590800," That's it."
5590800,5592560," As soon as I answer the question, I'm done."
5592560,5595040," There's no need to test shit ton of different functions."
5595040,5595360," Right."
5595360,5597040," So, it's a very simple question."
5597040,5598000," I just want to answer it."
5598000,5600560," I can't ask shit GPT because it's dumb."
5600560,5602400," It's fucking dumb."
5602400,5603200," It is no shit."
5604320,5604960," All right."
5604960,5606160," So, everything seems to be compiling."
5606160,5606400," Right."
5606400,5607520," So, everything seems to be compiling."
5607520,5610000," So, here's the web API and..."
5610000,5614800," Didn't play the second time though."
5614800,5618000," I didn't hear it playing the second time."
5618000,5623360," Is it really timeout in what?"
5623360,5624240," What's the timeout?"
5624240,5628000," Delay milliseconds."
5628000,5628480," Well, yeah."
5628480,5629600," 500 milliseconds."
5629600,5630400," So, what was that?"
5630400,5632080," What was that?"
5632080,5633120," Why didn't I replay?"
5633120,5634560," Does anybody know?"
5634560,5638560," So, maybe something happened."
5638560,5642080," Interval."
5642080,5642800," Not interval."
5642800,5643760," I don't need interval."
5643760,5644720," I need timeout."
5644720,5646160," I need to do it twice."
5646160,5648480," I don't need constantly playing it all the time."
5648480,5649920," It was already playing."
5649920,5650800," I don't fucking know."
5650800,5653600," So, I suppose that was the problem."
5653600,5653840," Yeah."
5653840,5654400," It was already..."
5654400,5656480," Yeah."
5656480,5659840," You can't play them like in interleaved fashion."
5659840,5660560," That's the problem."
5660560,5662000," That's the hugest problem in here."
5662000,5666320," Like, how can I play several of them?"
5666320,5675680," Do I have to really fucking create several audios, several sources and connect all of them?"
5676480,5679120," Is it really how it has to do that?"
5679120,5693040," And if this is really how it has to do that, I have to create manually a pool of samples of the same audio and then schedule it like looking which one is not playing right now."
5693040,5693920," Okay, I'm gonna play."
5693920,5698240," Is this really what I have to do in the web, which is supposed to be convenient?"
5698240,5701120," Like, I mean, it's not difficult for me to do."
5701120,5702000," Don't get me wrong."
5702000,5703840," It's not difficult for me to do."
5703840,5706720," I was just thinking that it will do that for me automatically."
5706720,5711600," I mean, canvas for audio."
5711600,5712400," Okay, sure, sure."
5712400,5715840," It's a canvas for audio, but canvas mixes the colors for you."
5715840,5719120," If I put a transparency color, it will mix them for me."
5719120,5721600," I don't have to write the code for mixing the pixels."
5721600,5722320," You don't get it."
5722320,5723680," It's not a fair comparison."
5723680,5727040," It is not a fair comparison saying, oh, it's just a canvas."
5727040,5727440," No, no, no."
5727440,5729760," Canvas does a lot of shit for you, actually, automatically."
5729760,5731440," Canvas does a lot for you."
5731440,5736080," Is this really how I have to?"
5736080,5737040," This is stupid."
5737040,5740160," This is just stupid."
5740160,5744240," This should be like a normal manual way."
5744240,5745760," Okay, I have the same sample."
5745760,5748000," How do I play it rapidly while overlapping?"
5750240,5752400," That's a common thing to do for games, right?"
5752400,5754240," And people do games for web."
5754240,5755760," It's a very common thing to do."
5755760,5756480," How do I do that?"
5756480,5760880," Is there a simple way to just like rapidly play the same sample also overlapping?"
5760880,5765520," RayLib can do that as far as I know, right?"
5765520,5769440," So if I remember correctly, like if you have like a sound, you play it several times."
5769440,5770720," It will overlap and stuff."
5770720,5777040," Doing a raw rectangle is the most complex concept in web dev can imagine."
5779520,5780560," What about says it?"
5780560,5781280," No, no, no, no."
5781280,5783360," This is not about implementation."
5783360,5784000," No, no, no, no."
5784000,5784960," You didn't get it wrong."
5784960,5790080," You're going into the how do we implement thing that should have been supported in the first place."
5790080,5791040," No, no, no, no, no."
5791040,5792240," Let's not go there."
5792240,5793680," We don't go there."
5793680,5795520," We don't go there."
5795520,5802560," We're going to go there only after we confirm that, yes, the API is so fucking dumb that we have to do some stupid shit."
5802560,5804160," We need to confirm that."
5804160,5805200," We don't know that yet."
5805200,5806080," Right."
5806080,5809120," So it's called what is multiplexing."
5809120,5809440," Okay."
5809440,5811840," Right."
5811840,5813120," So multiplexing."
5813120,5817120," So audio worklet."
5817120,5821920," Is it part of the web audio API or is it part of some different API?"
5821920,5825040," Or is that what it is?"
5825040,5825840," Right."
5825840,5826320," I don't know."
5826320,5829760," Is that the same or is that it's a different API?"
5829760,5830880," It's an interface."
5830880,5831440," Oh, okay."
5831440,5834800," So it's this is supply custom audio processing script."
5834800,5839280," Again, you guys don't understand what I'm talking about."
5839280,5843120," You guys don't understand what I'm talking about."
5843120,5845840," Like you are suggesting how to do stupid shit."
5845840,5846720," Right."
5846720,5848080," How do we do this stupid shit?"
5848080,5852880," My question is, do we have to do stupid shit or is it just there is a standard way to do that?"
5852880,5854160," Right."
5854160,5857440," So custom script."
5857440,5859840," You're going too far ahead."
5860400,5860880," Right."
5860880,5865680," So you just accepted that there is no other way but doing stupid shit."
5865680,5867360," I'm still having hope."
5867360,5871440," Can we just not do stupid shit and just have like, you know, I have a sample."
5871440,5872800," I created sample."
5872800,5874160," It has a play method."
5874160,5878800," I call play method several times and it just plays it several times also overlapping."
5878800,5880640," Because that would be the same API."
5880640,5882800," Maybe, maybe we don't have to do all this stupid shit."
5882800,5883360," Maybe."
5883360,5884160," I don't fucking know."
5884160,5885360," Right."
5885360,5887280," So that's what I'm asking."
5887280,5890960," So don't give me solutions how to do stupid shit."
5890960,5892640," We haven't confirmed that you have to do it."
5892640,5894480," Right."
5894480,5895840," We haven't confirmed how to do it."
5895840,5903440," Like, you want to have a simple interface sound play and the web sound API should mix it with what plays."
5903440,5916880," Like, I'm down to implementing complex, stupid shit."
5916880,5917760," Don't get me wrong."
5917760,5918800," I'm down to do that."
5918800,5921520," But I just like need to confirm that we have to do that."
5921520,5921760," Right."
5921760,5924800," Uh, it's not that difficult honestly."
5924800,5925040," Right."
5925040,5925840," It's not that difficult."
5925840,5930880," So audio node represents the audio processing module like audio source."
5930880,5932560," But that just means I have to read."
5932560,5936320," So some people said it's called multiplexing or something."
5936320,5939520," Multiplexing multiplex."
5939520,5943600," Dynamic compression node provides compression effects which lower the volume."
5944160,5949760," Clipping distortions can occur when multiple and multiplex together."
5949760,5950000," Okay."
5950000,5952400," Multiplex."
5952400,5955040," Okay."
5955040,5961200," So this is going to send how to use constant source node to link multiple parameters together."
5961200,5965280," So they share the same value which can be changed by setting offset."
5965280,5966240," Controlling multiple."
5966240,5967440," Oh, it's a multiplexing."
5967440,5969200," Multiplex."
5970800,5974640," So multiplexing only occurs like one times in here."
5974640,5975440," One time in here."
5975440,5980320," Only one time in here."
5980320,5994320," Dude, you fundamentally misunderstand what I'm doing."
5994320,5997120," Third party software, but that's not your style."
5997120,6000480," Dude, you fundamentally misunderstand what I'm about."
6000480,6003040," It's not about the style."
6003040,6005840," This is not a style."
6005840,6007440," This is not a fucking fashion."
6007440,6010160," This is software development."
6010160,6010720," Right."
6010720,6011840," This is engineering."
6011840,6020320," We are car engineers who study and design car internal combustion engines."
6020320,6025200," You coming in here and saying to us, guys, why are you doing all that shit?"
6025200,6026560," Just buy a car."
6026560,6030720," The car dealership right across the road just go buy a car."
6030720,6033360," No, it's not about having a car, bro."
6033360,6036160," It's not about having a car."
6036160,6038240," We are engineers."
6038240,6039520," We fucking make them."
6039520,6042080," It's not style."
6042080,6044080," This is not a fucking fashion."
6044080,6044640," We are doing engineering."
6044640,6045600," We are doing engineering."
6045600,6059520," I swear to God, 10 years ago, people just inherently understood what I was saying."
6059520,6060400," Right."
6060400,6065840," It's just like you wouldn't have to explain that."
6065840,6068160," People would just like understand that."
6068160,6068480," Yeah."
6068480,6068800," Okay."
6068800,6071040," So we're doing actual software engineering in that case."
6071040,6071200," Yeah."
6071200,6073360," We want to just like do that, that, and that."
6073360,6074880," It's not, it wasn't style."
6074880,6077520," It wasn't style."
6077520,6079600," Right."
6079600,6085120," It's so bizarre to me that tech degraded to this fucking point where it's just also fashion."
6085120,6088960," This third party is fashion this month."
6088960,6090160," We're using a different one."
6090400,6098080," And that's how you fucking lose tech, by the way, friends."
6098080,6099200," That's how you fucking lose."
6099200,6102160," When everyone stops doing tech, that's when you lose it."
6102160,6105120," Anyways."
6105120,6108800," So when everyone just pretends doing tech."
6108800,6113120," All right."
6113120,6116880," This one, a constant."
6116880,6117200," No, okay."
6117200,6118400," So this one is interesting, actually."
6120880,6122960," multiple rhymes constant source node."
6122960,6126000," So you're going to be saying how to use."
6126000,6128960," I remember that, by the way, at the beginning, they were talking about like a"
6128960,6130160," shit ton of stuff."
6130160,6133120," You can play shit ton of stuff and it's going to be fine."
6133120,6135200," I think I just need to read this kind of stuff."
6135200,6135600," Right."
6135600,6139360," I don't like reading huge walls of text, but I think in this case, we have to do that."
6139360,6144640," So what do you pay involves handling audio operations inside the audio context that has been"
6144640,6149760," designed to allow modular routing and basic audio operations are performed with audio"
6149760,6154640," nodes, which are linked together to form an audio routing graph, several sources."
6155440,6158640," So that audio worklet was actually kind of interesting."
6158640,6161600," So somebody actually suggested to do that."
6161600,6164320," So they were like audio, audio shares."
6164320,6164640," Right."
6164640,6170080," So, but maybe, you know, with different types and channel layout, this module design provides"
6170080,6173360," the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects."
6173360,6179040," Audio nodes are linked into chains."
6179040,6184960," Outputs of this node could be linked to inputs of others, which mix and modify the streams of audio"
6184960,6187520," samples into different streams."
6187520,6195040," A common modification is multiplying the sample by a value to make them louder or quieter, as the case with"
6195040,6200640," gain node, once the sound has been sufficiently processed for the intended effect."
6202320,6206640," It can be linked to other destinations, blah, blah, blah."
6206640,6209520," Simple, typical workflow for the web audio."
6209520,6210480," Create audio context."
6210480,6212000," Instead of the code is create audio."
6212000,6213200," So let it create effects."
6213200,6215680," Note, choose final destination audio."
6215680,6217440," For example, use system speakers."
6217440,6222560," Connect the source up to effects and effects to the destination."
6222560,6225760," Timing is controlled with high precision, low latency."
6225760,6230080," The right code responds accurately to events and able to target specific samples."
6230080,6234240," unit high sample rates of applications such as drum machines and sequences."
6234240,6234720," Well, yeah."
6234720,6237600," That's exactly what I'm talking about, Riff."
6237600,6238880," That's exactly what I'm talking about."
6238880,6242400," So..."
6242400,6249200," Rewind."
6249200,6258000," So we already in the game, we were..."
6258560,6263840," Yeah, so directly using audio node is no different than whatever the fuck we were doing anyway."
6263840,6270000," This is no different than whatever the fuck we were doing anyway."
6270000,6276880," I feel like we have to do this stupid shit."
6276880,6280080," I feel like we have to do this stupid shit."
6282000,6282720," Is there..."
6282720,6283040," Okay."
6283040,6293520," Is there any node that periodically calls a function that generates the next chunk of samples?"
6293520,6295600," That's the real question in here."
6295600,6301440," Is there some sort of node that periodically asks for more samples?"
6301440,6305200," Is that that audio worklet somebody actually suggested?"
6307920,6309280," Is that that audio worklet?"
6309280,6310480," Okay, let me actually see."
6310480,6311120," No."
6311120,6313280," The answer to which question?"
6313280,6316080," Okay."
6316080,6319120," So, are you just trolling?"
6319120,6320080," Oh, it's probably troll."
6320080,6321120," You don't even have a sub."
6321120,6323520," Okay."
6323520,6330320," Interface just supply custom audio processing script that execute in separate thread to provide very little..."
6330880,6332720," I think that's what we need."
6332720,6334240," I think that's what literally we need."
6334240,6340240," So, if we have worklet, we can have a worklet also connected to Wasm module."
6341360,6341760," Right."
6341760,6345040," That generates the sample so we can do audio mixing in Wasm."
6345040,6355920," So, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
6355920,6360960," And there's no..."
6360960,6361280," Yeah."
6361280,6364000," Examples."
6364000,6366960," So, worklet node for complete example."
6366960,6367200," Okay."
6368080,6371200," So, represents a base class for usage of IonCure."
6371200,6372320," IonCure."
6372320,6372640," Okay."
6372640,6375680," So, class random..."
6375680,6376720," Oh, okay, okay."
6376720,6380960," So, you extend the audio worklet processor."
6380960,6381520," And you process..."
6381520,6383200," You have inputs, you have outputs."
6383200,6385840," Brow."
6385840,6388560," That's the shit."
6388560,6390560," What's the inputs, though?"
6390560,6396080," What's the type of the inputs?"
6396880,6398160," I need the type of inputs."
6398160,6399840," Worklet processor."
6399840,6401040," So, let's take a look at the work."
6401040,6401280," Yeah."
6401280,6403440," I think we're onto something."
6403440,6405280," Worklet audio."
6405280,6409680," Stop twitching around processor."
6409680,6412960," There's no such thing."
6412960,6419040," And classes derived from the cannot be instantly directed from a user supplied code."
6419040,6419360," Fuck."
6419360,6422080," Okay, sure."
6422080,6423680," But where is the method?"
6423680,6424080," Port?"
6424080,6428320," Bro, I just want to know what is the input output."
6428320,6429200," Shut the fuck up."
6429200,6432560," Oh my god."
6432560,6433360," Like, okay."
6433360,6435040," So, what is the process?"
6435040,6439360," The method process."
6439360,6441600," Just give me the fucking signature of this method."
6441600,6442720," Bro."
6444560,6445120," Finally."
6445120,6446880," Freaking."
6446880,6453040," So fucking dumb."
6453040,6453920," I swear to God."
6453920,6459520," So, audio worklet process."
6459520,6460880," Oh, there's just a worklet."
6460880,6462560," All right."
6462560,6464320," Worklet."
6466240,6469200," And there is no type for this thing."
6469200,6472000," There's actually no type for this thing."
6472000,6475920," So."
6475920,6481040," In the TypeScript specifically."
6481040,6482000," All right."
6482000,6483600," So, there's no for this thing."
6483600,6485360," So, this is the float32."
6485360,6487040," Outputs the similar to input."
6487040,6488160," Parameter in the structure."
6488160,6489440," Parameters."
6489440,6490400," Okay."
6490400,6490640," Okay."
6490640,6491680," So, that's pretty cool."
6491680,6492640," All right."
6492640,6494240," So, that's probably what we want to do."
6494240,6496320," And in here."
6496320,6497680," Surprisingly."
6497680,6498400," Maybe this is."
6498400,6499920," Where."
6499920,6502400," We have to."
6502400,6504240," Just."
6504240,6505440," You know."
6505440,6509600," Next to main script file."
6509600,6510560," Will load the processor."
6510560,6512400," Create instance of audio worklet."
6512400,6513360," Note passing it."
6513360,6514400," Name of the processor."
6514400,6515920," Connect node to audio graph."
6515920,6516560," And stuff like that."
6516560,6517760," So, here's the audio context."
6517760,6518720," Oh."
6518720,6521040," It has to be even separate script."
6522640,6523200," Mm-hmm."
6523200,6525920," Because it's going to be a separate."
6525920,6527760," Thread."
6527760,6529600," So, it's a separate worker even."
6529600,6530000," Right."
6530000,6530880," So, because they said."
6530880,6532640," We talked about separate threads."
6532640,6539520," Oh."
6539520,6540560," They even said that?"
6540560,6540800," Really?"
6540800,6542880," Holy shit."
6542880,6544640," So, from docs."
6544640,6545760," It's worth noting that."
6545760,6548000," Because audio processing can be often involved."
6548000,6549200," Substantial computation."
6549200,6550400," Your processor might benefit."
6550400,6554880," Greatly from being built using WebAssembly."
6554880,6557280," That is actually fascinating."
6557280,6558000," Okay."
6558000,6561280," So, this is the thing that we want to do."
6561280,6564880," So, we're going to be mixing all of that stuff ourselves."
6564880,6567360," Yeah."
6567360,6569200," I think I'm down to do that."
6569200,6570320," I'm down to do that."
6570320,6572160," But do we have time to even do that?"
6572160,6573840," I think we don't have time to do that."
6573840,6575520," But maybe if we make a small break."
6575520,6577120," Make a cup of tea."
6577120,6580800," I want to at least learn how to use the worklet API."
6580800,6583520," I want to at least learn how to do the worklet API."
6583520,6585920," Right."
6585920,6589440," Because if we're going to be building it in Wasm."
6589440,6591120," We can just build it in C3."
6591120,6591920," Right."
6591920,6593440," So, yeah."
6593440,6597120," I like that."
6597680,6598560," I like where it's going."
6598560,6599840," I like where it's going, Chad."
6599840,6605760," You can't share your Wasm, though."
6605760,6607360," At least not in details."
6607360,6608320," Whatever."
6608320,6609440," I think we can figure it out."
6609440,6611120," Right."
6611120,6611600," So, because..."
6611600,6613760," Yeah."
6613760,6619200," So, we can just have a separate Wasm module responsible specifically for mixing sounds."
6619200,6619760," And something."
6619760,6621040," Right."
6621040,6626320," Because when you develop stuff in a purely native fashion and you're also writing your own,"
6626320,6629440," you know, mixer."
6629440,6629680," Right."
6629680,6630960," So, you do that in a callback."
6630960,6634960," And that callback is usually run in a separate thread as well."
6634960,6638400," But, I mean, granted, the threads usually share the memory."
6638400,6639280," Right."
6639280,6641840," Here, you're kind of running it in a separate process in a sense."
6641840,6643280," It's just like..."
6643280,6643520," Yeah."
6643520,6645280," It's just a different approach slightly."
6645280,6646800," So, you don't have a shareable memory."
6646800,6651280," But, I mean, it's like have a separate Wasm thingy."
6651280,6654880," So, yeah."
6654880,6656480," It's kind of cool."
6656480,6657120," Kind of cool."
6657120,6658400," So, I think we're getting there."
6658400,6659760," I want to make a small break."
6659760,6660720," I want to make a small break."
6660720,6669360," And after the small break, we're going to try to maybe generate this demo, this synthesizer demo"
6669360,6671680," in a worklet dynamically."
6671680,6675360," Because here, what we're doing, we pre-generate the sample."
6675360,6676160," Right."
6676160,6677360," We pre-generate the sample."
6677360,6678800," What if we generate it on the fly?"
6678800,6680720," Right."
6680720,6684800," So, we can generate it on the fly and play constantly through that worklet thingy."
6684800,6690720," And then, once we generate it on the fly, what if we port it to C3 and compile the web assembly?"
6690720,6691360," Will it work?"
6691360,6697280," And if we can do that, that's pretty much everything we need."
6697280,6697600," Right."
6697600,6701280," So, and then, we can just integrate this idea into the coil."
6701280,6702880," Right."
6702880,6705760," So, we integrated Visualizer."
6705760,6710720," There was, by the way, whatever research work we're doing right now, and we are right now doing"
6710720,6712880," research work for our engineering."
6712880,6713120," Right."
6713120,6715840," So, first we do research and then we engineer something out of that."
6716960,6720240," So, this research work can be useful for Visualizer."
6720240,6721600," Actually."
6721600,6722400," Right."
6722400,6724960," So, it's kind of cool."
6724960,6730960," So, all of the things that I try and experiment with, they're kind of always interlived all the time."
6730960,6736000," So, while working on some ideas, I can get more ideas for some other project and so on and so forth."
6736000,6737920," There's constantly, like, they're all connected."
6737920,6740880," They're all entangled into, like, a single universe."
6740880,6741120," Right."
6741120,6747600," So, it's not like each individual project, I work on them separately and in isolation."
6747600,6750320," Everything is, like, kind of connected."
6750320,6751600," It's actually kind of cool."
6751600,6754640," It's basically, I'm working on one single project."
6754640,6754800," Right."
6754800,6757520," So, all the projects are just mixed together into one single thing."
6757520,6759040," Interesting."
6759040,6761200," So, yeah."
6761200,6762960," All right."
6762960,6763920," So, let's make some more break."
6763920,6765440," I'm going to make a cup of tea."
6765440,6771440," And once we have a cup of tea, we will try to learn how to use audio worklets."
6771440,6775680," Thank you so much, the person who actually mentioned audio worklets."
6775680,6776720," I really appreciate it."
6776720,6777600," So, let's make some more break."
6777600,6779120," All right."
6779120,6785520," So, let's try to figure out how audio worklet node works and how to use it and stuff like that."
6785520,6787440," So, there was an example somewhere there."
6787440,6789680," So, I have a lot of things opened."
6789680,6791680," So, let me maybe start over."
6793360,6794320," All right."
6794320,6795840," So, let's close all of that."
6795840,6798400," Audio worklet."
6798400,6801360," So, here's that."
6801360,6802720," And there was an example."
6802720,6805520," So, we see node."
6805520,6808800," So, here is an example."
6808800,6812160," So, the first thing we have to do, we have to create this thing."
6812160,6815120," So, they are using random noise processor."
6815120,6815520," Right."
6815520,6819680," In our case, I think we're going to be using like a generator of a specific frequency of the"
6819680,6820640," specific semitone."
6820640,6828240," So, register processor."
6828240,6830800," And this is a very interesting function."
6832080,6834080," Is this like it's at the top?"
6834080,6836320," I don't really see it at the top."
6836320,6838160," But anyway."
6838160,6840160," If I just go ahead."
6840160,6842560," Oh, it's actually in a separate file."
6842560,6843040," Look at that."
6843040,6846320," So, it's a random noise generator."
6849200,6849760," All right."
6849760,6854960," So, let's call it synth ts."
6854960,6855120," Right."
6855120,6856960," So, this is a synth ts."
6856960,6860160," And I wonder if I can use that in a module mode."
6860160,6862880," So, as of right now, I don't."
6862880,6864880," But maybe we'll be able to do that."
6864880,6869760," So, in the program here, as you can see, it doesn't know anything about audio workload processor."
6869760,6870960," It literally doesn't exist."
6870960,6872560," And we already kind of confirmed that."
6872560,6876960," So, maybe I have to import some sort of module in here."
6876960,6878000," I'm not sure."
6878000,6882720," So, type script audio workload processor."
6882720,6895840," I'm..."
6899760,6900000," Okay."
6900000,6904000," PRs are welcomes."
6904000,6907840," Okay."
6907840,6910960," So, people are suggesting to just tsignore."
6910960,6912400," Let's see."
6912400,6914880," How do I even do that?"
6914880,6916000," Right."
6916000,6917680," So, do I just put this thing here?"
6917680,6919360," Is it going to work?"
6919360,6921200," Or..."
6921200,6924160," Is that how it works?"
6924160,6924720," Oh, okay."
6924720,6926560," So, tsignore."
6926560,6928960," And it just basically ignores that thing."
6928960,6932800," Maybe we could have our own thing."
6932800,6933120," All right."
6933120,6936720," Because we could have set that interface that..."
6936720,6939040," It's not even an interface."
6939040,6942240," It has to be like a class on its own."
6942240,6944480," But no, not set."
6944480,6945600," It could be an interface, actually."
6945600,6947520," So, and it has a process."
6947520,6951440," But again, it has to be a class."
6951440,6953520," It just has to be a class."
6953520,6956880," All right."
6956880,6958960," So, float 32 array."
6958960,6962000," Float 32 array."
6962000,6964080," And what were the parameters?"
6964080,6965280," What were the parameters?"
6965280,6970960," That's a bit annoying."
6970960,6971920," So, we are..."
6971920,6974160," Interestingly..."
6974160,6975200," Okay."
6975200,6976480," Here's the interesting thought."
6976480,6980880," The fact that the type definitions for this class does not exist."
6980880,6985600," that means TypeScript, an average TypeScript developer doesn't really need it very often."
6985600,6992000," We are in a very much uncharted territory."
6992000,6993760," Right."
6993760,6997600," So, it only occurred to me right now."
6997600,7004080," The fact that it doesn't have this type definition means that 99.99999% of TypeScript users just don't"
7004080,7004800," fucking need it."
7004800,7006960," Like, just, just, just buy a car."
7006960,7008800," It's like the dealership is across the road."
7008800,7011680," Like, I mean, why the fuck are you doing all that?"
7011680,7018960," Anyways, anyways, anyways, anyways, anyways, anyways."
7023040,7024480," What if we don't accept this thing?"
7024480,7025360," So, output..."
7025360,7029520," Are you telling me that there is a typo in the..."
7029520,7031920," Ah."
7031920,7033600," Uh-huh."
7033600,7035600," Ooh."
7035600,7039120," So, the outputs is actually..."
7042080,7049040," There are several of them, so that means it's an array of float32 or something?"
7049040,7049760," Yeah."
7049760,7053520," Where is the definition?"
7053520,7056640," Aha."
7056640,7059280," Aha."
7059280,7061440," Frozen array."
7061440,7062560," Okay, I see."
7062560,7067600," So, it's a frozen array of frozen array of float32."
7069840,7071360," Damn, that's a..."
7071360,7074800," So, this is a callback."
7074800,7085280," So, it accepts array of array of array."
7085280,7087120," Three-dimensional array."
7087120,7089600," What is a frozen array?"
7089600,7090080," I don't know."
7090080,7092000," It's from the specs."
7092000,7094240," From the web specs."
7094240,7099680," Frozen array type is a parameterized type whose values are references to objects that hold a fixed length"
7099680,7101360," array of unmodifiable value."
7101360,7103920," The values in the array are type of t."
7103920,7107760," So, it's a read-only array."
7107760,7112000," So, it's array of array of array of floats."
7112000,7113680," This is the inputs."
7113680,7116000," This is three-dimensional arrays."
7116000,7120880," And the parameter is just objects, so they are not even specified."
7120880,7125760," Maybe this is the actual reason why there is no type for that."
7125760,7128240," Because maybe it's difficult to express that in TypeScript."
7128240,7131440," But I doubt that TypeScript can actually express very complicated things."
7131440,7133920," Oh, yeah."
7133920,7134560," It's like..."
7134560,7135520," It is like that, literally."
7135520,7138160," Okay."
7138160,7138960," So, thank you so much."
7138960,7140720," I'm going to just steal that on this one."
7142400,7145920," So, this is array of arrays."
7145920,7147200," And this is array of arrays."
7147200,7148240," And this is parameters."
7148240,7149760," Might as well..."
7149760,7151280," Yeah."
7151280,7154000," That's a good idea, actually, to keep it here."
7154000,7158320," Okay."
7158320,7160880," Everything compiles all of a sudden."
7160880,7163120," This is a very good issue."
7163120,7165840," Thank you so much for providing at least a workaround for this kind of stuff."
7165840,7167440," Because usually people don't do that."
7167440,7167680," All right."
7167680,7169760," So, at least we have a workaround for this kind of stuff."
7169760,7174480," And I really appreciate these kind of workarounds."
7174480,7177040," Okay."
7177040,7181280," So, I'm kind of surprised."
7181280,7182960," So, if this is the output."
7184160,7190000," And for each of the output, we're iterating through all of the channels."
7190000,7193920," This is the inputs, so to speak."
7193920,7194800," I see, I see, I see."
7194800,7199360," All right."
7199360,7202400," So, for all of them, we're just generating all of this."
7202400,7205440," I see, I see, I see."
7205440,7207600," That makes sense."
7207600,7210960," So, the first layer of arrays is the inputs."
7211840,7214560," And the second layer of arrays is the outputs."
7214560,7217520," So, how many inputs the node has, the processor has,"
7217520,7220000," and how many outputs the mode has, right?"
7220000,7221680," The node has."
7221680,7224400," The second layer of arrays are the channels."
7224400,7226960," And the channels are left channel, right channel."
7226960,7229360," If you speak about headphones, speakers, right?"
7229360,7232240," If you have like a subwoofer system and stuff like that,"
7232240,7235280," you can have like up to five channels and so on and so forth."
7235280,7236640," You can have a lot of channels there."
7236640,7238000," So, that's the channels."
7238000,7241760," And the last layer of arrays in here is array of samples."
7241840,7246400," All right, so all of that makes sense, I suppose, right?"
7246400,7247360," So, all of that makes sense."
7247360,7252480," Funnily enough, if you're going to be implementing all of that in WebAssembly,"
7252480,7259040," you're going to spend quite some time just passing that information to WebAssembly memory."
7259040,7261200," But maybe that's fast."
7261200,7262240," I don't freaking know."
7262240,7264480," Because this is just a float32 arrays."
7264480,7278320," You can take a segment of Wasm memory, view it as float32 array, and just use the set method of float32 array to copy another float32 array,"
7278320,7282320," which internally, I suspect, is going to use memcpy, right?"
7282320,7286640," So, browser probably just use memcpy to copy chunks of this memory."
7286640,7293520," And when you use memcpy, it probably uses some very efficient implementation of memory copy from one place to another."
7293520,7298160," So, it's usually very fast, especially if the chunks of the samples are relatively small."
7298160,7302160," I think it's going to be super fast just copying that stuff to there."
7302160,7310080," Speaking of how computers works and what computers do, that's what I mean when I say that."
7310080,7311280," Somebody was asking before."
7311280,7321520," All right, so I think what we need to do now, we also need to keep track of the current time."
7323120,7324880," Do we need to keep track of the current time?"
7324880,7330960," We can actually keep track of the current time through maybe a process."
7330960,7343360," I'm just thinking how we're going to be approaching all that stuff."
7343360,7347120," I need to know what's in these parameters."
7350960,7352080," Yeah, performance now probably."
7352080,7356960," Yeah, I'm going to be using performance now, but I also need to know the sample rate."
7356960,7360800," I need to know the sample rate of this entire thing."
7360800,7362880," And the question is, where can I acquire it?"
7362880,7369040," So, it's probably within the parameters, but it's not specified what kind of parameters can I have there."
7369040,7374080," I can do something very stupid, actually."
7374080,7376560," So, it also returns true or false."
7376560,7377200," Look at that."
7377200,7382800," It was not encoded in here that this thing returns boolean."
7382800,7387840," I think we should include that because in the example, it does include that."
7387840,7393760," So, you know what I want to do?"
7393760,7400400," I want to throw an exception, like so, and say parameters."
7400400,7403360," Parameters."
7403360,7404000," I want to see them."
7404000,7410720," But maybe since it's a map, we're not going to see that, but it doesn't matter, right?"
7410720,7412960," So, because we can just fuck around and find out."
7413600,7416240," So, here's the JS that we managed to get."
7416240,7421200," We probably want to get rid of the comments, remove comments."
7421200,7425600," Revert buffer."
7425600,7429120," So, now it doesn't have any comments and that's literally what it does."
7429120,7431120," That's the entirety of it."
7434640,7441120," So, afterwards, once we've got this worklet node."
7441120,7443760," I think I also want to put that in the description, right?"
7443760,7446640," So, it's part of the thing we're doing, essentially."
7446640,7449600," Right."
7449600,7458320," Once we get that, we go into the audio context and we take the audio worklet and we add a module."
7458320,7461280," Oh, you also have to register the processor."
7461280,7462960," I completely forgot about that."
7462960,7466080," You have to register this entire thing in here."
7466080,7471440," And there is no definition for this thing, unfortunately."
7471440,7473600," So, maybe we have to do it like that."
7473600,7475280," Let's TS ignore it for now."
7475280,7478480," So, now..."
7478480,7484640," So, we have an audio context, a random noise generator."
7484640,7490720," So, the audio context and then we connect a random noise generator to audio destination."
7490720,7492560," And I suppose that's about it."
7492560,7493600," Okay."
7493600,7494560," So, that's pretty cool."
7494560,7498720," Let's go into the index MTS."
7498720,7506800," So, I think I want to"
7508960,7515040," actually move this entire demo to a separate function."
7515040,7517120," Function."
7517120,7519040," Right."
7519040,7521440," Game sounds demo."
7521440,7522960," Like this."
7522960,7525440," And it's going to accept audio context."
7525440,7527280," So, this is audio context."
7527280,7529840," Context, like so."
7529840,7533840," And we're going to be passing this stuff in there."
7536400,7537680," So, like this."
7537680,7539440," Cool."
7539440,7545280," And in here, we're going to start with this idea."
7545280,7547760," Which is in audio context, we have work."
7547760,7552320," Audio worklet."
7552320,7555760," Add module."
7555760,7556560," This one is interesting."
7556560,7559760," It uses the word module, but does it run it in the module mode?"
7559760,7561760," Lows and execute a module script."
7562720,7563440," By a module."
7563440,7565520," It is in the module mode."
7565520,7567840," It is literally in the module mode."
7567840,7573360," Because of that, maybe we can actually take this synth and actually call it MTS."
7573360,7576080," Can we do that?"
7576080,7576240," Right."
7576240,7577040," Because it's a module."
7577040,7578640," We can do that."
7578640,7585200," So, yeah."
7585200,7587200," So, we can actually remove JS."
7587200,7588480," Like so."
7588480,7589920," And here is in the module."
7589920,7590240," Okay."
7590240,7592400," So, we want to maintain that convention, so to speak."
7592400,7595440," Synth MJS."
7595440,7595680," Right."
7595680,7596800," So, this is the URL."
7596800,7599520," And that's about it, I suppose."
7599520,7599760," Right."
7599760,7602640," So, we just created a worklet for this entity, I think."
7602640,7605120," Right."
7606240,7612240," So, after that, we do new audio worklet node."
7612240,7620160," In here, in terms of constructors, we have base audio context, based audio context, audio context."
7620160,7623920," And the last thing is the name."
7623920,7624800," Right."
7624800,7629040," And I suppose the name, it just uses this sort of prefix."
7629040,7631280," It uses the name of the module."
7631280,7631760," I see."
7631760,7633040," It uses the name of the module."
7633040,7635040," So, that's why it has to be module URL."
7635040,7638880," So, they're kind of pushing the module JavaScript in on the level of like."
7638880,7643840," On the level of new API."
7643840,7645280," Right."
7645280,7648080," So, this is the synth const synth."
7648080,7650880," How do you call that?"
7650880,7651280," Node."
7651280,7652400," Let it go."
7653280,7657840," So, and after that, we're just connecting this thing to the destination."
7657840,7658880," I suppose."
7658880,7659040," Right."
7659040,7659920," So, that's what we do."
7659920,7661600," Right."
7661600,7662080," Synth."
7662080,7663840," Synth node."
7663840,7665120," Connect."
7665120,7667120," Audio."
7667120,7667840," Context."
7667840,7669440," Destination."
7669440,7672240," Everything compiles."
7672240,7673040," It seems to be."
7673040,7674560," Right."
7674560,7675440," SynthMJS."
7675440,7677360," So, we register that."
7677360,7679040," Everything seems to be good."
7679040,7680320," And indexMJS."
7681680,7682800," Everything seems to be good."
7682800,7684160," All right."
7684160,7684720," Let's go."
7684720,7688240," It should not play anything."
7688240,7690560," But it should crash with an exception."
7690560,7694480," Audio constructor unknown worklet name Synth."
7694480,7700880," Did I fuck up something in the synth itself?"
7700880,7702000," Yeah."
7702000,7707680," I think I did in fact fuck up."
7710160,7710480," Okay."
7710480,7712400," Unknown worklet."
7712400,7718160," Did it cache this shit?"
7718160,7729760," The second parameter should be the name of the register."
7729760,7730320," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
7730320,7732880," I think so."
7735040,7736640," But it doesn't matter."
7736640,7741040," Don't freaking tell me that this modaflipper cached that stuff."
7741040,7743280," Okay."
7743280,7744720," So, it loaded this stuff up."
7744720,7747920," It says not modified."
7747920,7749440," Right."
7749440,7752080," But what's the actual value of this thing?"
7752080,7753600," Response."
7753600,7755200," Yeah, Synth."
7755200,7755520," Okay."
7755520,7757360," So, experts."
7757360,7760640," Maybe because it was not exported."
7761280,7762800," Constructor unknown audio."
7762800,7763840," Yeah, it doesn't know about it."
7763840,7764800," Even though we..."
7764800,7766320," Maybe it should not be a module then."
7766320,7768080," Maybe we should not include expert."
7768080,7770400," Maybe that's the problem."
7772400,7774160," So, I don't freaking know."
7774160,7775440," I don't freaking know."
7775440,7779120," People, don't copy-paste code into the chat."
7779120,7781840," It looks horrible and it doesn't help anyone."
7781840,7783200," Stop doing that."
7783200,7784720," Stop copy-pasting code into the chat."
7784720,7786160," I'm not going to be looking into that anyway."
7786160,7788480," Something stupid."
7788480,7790080," I can already fucking feel that."
7790080,7792000," It is absolutely stupid."
7792000,7793520," Right."
7793520,7795840," So, module URL."
7795840,7799200," Module URL."
7799200,7800960," But it's not the cache."
7800960,7801920," We already know that."
7801920,7803680," Because it's named Synth."
7803680,7805520," Promise."
7805520,7805520," Promise."
7805520,7805520," Promise."
7805520,7807360," Somebody returns promise?"
7807360,7811040," Don't freaking tell me somebody."
7811040,7813520," Fuck you!"
7818400,7827760," What a horrible piece of shit web platform is."
7827760,7828480," It's insane."
7828480,7833280," Though it makes sense."
7833280,7833840," Yeah, I know."
7833840,7835840," But I mean, it could have at least told me that."
7835840,7836800," Or whatever."
7836800,7837600," I don't fucking know."
7837600,7842000," Jesus."
7842000,7843840," All right."
7843840,7844160," Let's go."
7844160,7847200," Object."
7847200,7847520," Let's go."
7847520,7847840," Let's go."
7847840,7847920," Let's go."
7847920,7849680," Yeah."
7849680,7853120," So, we can't see shit in this mist, which is understandable."
7853120,7858720," So, what I want to do is I want to do mts."
7858720,7860960," Right."
7860960,7862080," Okay."
7862080,7864320," So, we're going to say break."
7864320,7869040," And in a map, we probably want to do for each."
7869040,7869360," All right."
7869360,7870800," So, let's do parameters."
7870800,7872240," For each."
7873120,7876160," And in that specific for each, we have value and key."
7876160,7876960," Value key."
7876960,7879760," Console log."
7879760,7883040," I can just say something like."
7883040,7886000," Key."
7886000,7887680," Key."
7887680,7889360," Value."
7889360,7889920," Let's go."
7889920,7891680," Let's open go."
7895440,7896400," Okay."
7896400,7896400," Okay."
7896400,7899120," Parameters don't have it because it's an object."
7899120,7904960," Maybe it changed in the future."
7904960,7905280," Right."
7905280,7906880," So, they say it was an object."
7906880,7908560," All right."
7908560,7909760," So, they say it was an object."
7909760,7911120," So, maybe I'm going to do console."
7911120,7913200," Parameters."
7913200,7918080," And honestly, I think."
7918080,7919680," Let's just say that it's an object."
7919680,7925040," And this is also an object."
7925040,7928080," Because I think it can be more accurate to call it like that."
7932080,7932400," Right."
7932400,7941520," If it doesn't, does it contain anything useful?"
7941520,7944720," Okay."
7944720,7952400," I'm sorry for flash banging you."
7952400,7955200," Okay."
7955200,7956880," So, the object is straight up empty."
7956880,7958320," So, there's no parameters in there."
7959920,7963280," Is there any way to pass parameters there though?"
7963280,7965680," That's a real question."
7965680,7966720," When I'm constructing."
7966720,7967760," Okay."
7967760,7970240," So, there is a worklet options."
7970240,7972080," Aha."
7972080,7975040," Look at that."
7975040,7976080," Look at that."
7976080,7976560," Look at that."
7976560,7977040," Look at that."
7977040,7979760," You can probably put something in there."
7979760,7983600," So, let's actually put something in there."
7983600,7986080," So, it is options."
7986080,7988000," Right."
7988000,7990080," And within the options."
7990080,7991920," You just have parameter data."
7991920,7993840," Parameter data."
7993840,7995840," Your mom."
7995840,7998880," 69, 420."
7998880,7999600," Something like that."
7999600,8001360," Is it going?"
8001360,8002400," Does it even work?"
8002400,8005840," It doesn't like that."
8005840,8008240," But it doesn't mean that it's not going to work though."
8008240,8008960," That's the thing."
8008960,8011680," Yeah."
8011680,8013840," There's no info in here."
8016080,8017280," So, what exactly does it say?"
8017280,8020800," Is not assignable to type."
8020800,8021280," Ah."
8021280,8022400," It probably has to be."
8022400,8024160," I see."
8024160,8024480," I see."
8024480,8024880," I see."
8024880,8025600," So, it's probably."
8025600,8027920," Like it has to be specific numbers apparently."
8027920,8031680," Still nothing."
8036800,8038000," Sorry for further banging."
8038000,8041200," No."
8041200,8041920," It's empty."
8041920,8043280," How do you pass information?"
8043280,8044720," I need to pass information there."
8044720,8047840," Is there any way to pass information?"
8047840,8057120," Because parameter data kind of makes sense."
8059040,8060400," Number of channels."
8060400,8061440," Number of inputs."
8061440,8064080," Processor options."
8064080,8069040," So, and the record is specifically just this information."
8069040,8072400," Try accessing via your mom."
8072400,8072720," Okay."
8072720,8073040," Maybe."
8073040,8079680," So, maybe it's somewhere in the prototype higher or whatnot."
8079680,8084240," And by the way, since it's a record, we could probably say a record."
8085200,8085760," What was that?"
8085760,8088240," Record."
8088240,8090080," String."
8090080,8092000," Yeah."
8092000,8097040," What is this called?"
8097040,8098000," Yeah."
8098000,8098560," It's this one."
8098560,8101280," We could probably say that it's this one."
8101280,8102880," Since mts."
8102880,8104480," Right."
8104480,8105600," So, it's that one."
8105600,8109840," So, it doesn't complain about that stuff anymore."
8110800,8111360," Undefined."
8111360,8112000," It doesn't matter."
8112000,8116400," It's not where it is passed, though."
8116400,8118240," Though it makes sense."
8118240,8121120," It just makes sense."
8121120,8123200," Value off."
8123200,8126320," Value off."
8126320,8128480," Maybe that's what it has to be."
8128480,8131600," No."
8131600,8133920," You're getting into the mode of wasting my time again."
8133920,8135840," I'm going to ignore the chat again."
8135840,8138240," Waste of time."
8138960,8139280," All right."
8139280,8143360," So annoying."
8143360,8148000," This is very fucking important."
8148000,8150320," I need a way to pass information to that motherfucker."
8150320,8154400," So, add the module."
8154400,8155840," Process option."
8155840,8156960," Maybe parameters."
8156960,8158480," No."
8158480,8162800," Do you see the type definition?"
8166400,8168080," How does it make any fucking sense?"
8168080,8171120," Like, do you just make up names or?"
8171120,8173680," I'm going to put the sub mode."
8173680,8174160," That's where to go."
8174160,8176960," Um."
8176960,8180400," Okay."
8180400,8186320," Parameter descriptor."
8186320,8188080," What the fuck is a parameter descriptor?"
8188080,8189040," Uh."
8189040,8189760," Parameter."
8190640,8191200," It's not even."
8191200,8191440," It's not even."
8191440,8194720," It's one of these cases where it's just like not properly documented."
8194720,8196080," So, the types are incorrect."
8196080,8197680," You tell me."
8197680,8199040," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
8199040,8201440," So, the types are incorrect."
8201440,8206560," Holy shit."
8206560,8207280," What the fuck?"
8208800,8210320," So, static get parameter."
8210320,8211760," This is not what I want."
8211760,8213600," No, no, no."
8213600,8215680," I want to pass parameter into that thing."
8215680,8216560," Not from it."
8216560,8218320," I don't care about its parameters."
8218320,8220160," What is that?"
8220160,8221920," So, the workload processor parameter descriptor."
8221920,8222080," No."
8222080,8223120," This is not what I want."
8223120,8224960," I don't care."
8224960,8229840," So, this is getting them."
8229840,8231680," I want to set in there."
8231680,8234000," No."
8234000,8236560," Parameters property."
8238160,8241440," Ah, that means you can also have setters for this property, right?"
8241440,8244800," Setting should be below."
8244800,8245520," I don't see setting."
8245520,8246160," Where is the setting?"
8246160,8247200," I don't see it."
8247200,8248000," There's no setting."
8248000,8251120," Is that setting?"
8251120,8251920," There's no setting."
8251920,8254800," I don't see it."
8254800,8255440," It's so stupid."
8255440,8256240," Holy fucking shit."
8256240,8258800," I just passed the shit into there."
8258800,8259440," Set value."
8266320,8267840," Node parameter set."
8267840,8272960," Ah, okay."
8272960,8277040," So, if I don't do synth node."
8277040,8281120," Oh, okay."
8281120,8283600," So, this is a parameter."
8283600,8284880," Audio parameter map."
8286720,8287120," Okay."
8287120,8289920," So, and your mom."
8289920,8292160," Can I just set something like 69?"
8292160,8293680," Um."
8293680,8294560," Or."
8294560,8297040," Yeah, so it's a."
8297040,8299440," Oh, you can't even set it from here."
8299440,8300880," You can only set it from."
8300880,8302480," This is so stupid."
8302480,8305200," This is the stupidest API I've ever seen in my entire life."
8305200,8306000," Like, holy shit."
8306000,8307040," Excuse me."
8307040,8307440," Um."
8307440,8310960," Static get parameters descriptors return."
8310960,8316160," Like, it's so dumb."
8316160,8320480," Like, just give me a way to pass some object or whatever."
8320480,8322480," Like, why does it have to be so fucking dumb?"
8323120,8334000," So, to expand the processor by adding a static parameter getter, it will be used internally by audio construct to populate the parameters with instantiated audio param object."
8334960,8335920," Okay, and then."
8335920,8341840," But where do I pass information from this place?"
8341840,8344560," Well, okay."
8344560,8345840," So, from here."
8345840,8346560," Set value."
8346560,8349920," Audio constructs current time."
8349920,8352480," Default value."
8352480,8354080," So, automation rate."
8354080,8356720," This is dumb."
8356720,8360240," This is dumb."
8360240,8364080," I don't like that."
8364080,8366080," This is just, like, absolutely fucking horrible."
8366080,8370320," I want to just pass some number there and that's already a huge pain in the ass."
8370320,8374880," It's just, like, holy shit."
8374880,8377280," Okay."
8377280,8385040," So, like, how more complicated do you want to make passing a fucking number to a different class?"
8385040,8388000," For the sake of fucking job security."
8388000,8388720," It's insane."
8388720,8390240," It's fucking insane."
8390240,8393360," This is literally the reason why we have, like, waves of layoffs."
8394160,8395200," Fuck all of these people."
8395200,8396240," Get the fuck out of here."
8397120,8398480," So, I don't fucking know."
8398480,8401760," Let me see."
8401760,8402320," Index."
8402320,8402880," MTS."
8402880,8405280," Right."
8405280,8411280," So, and I'm stuck on absolutely fucking stupid shit, honestly."
8411280,8412320," Right."
8412320,8420160," Like, the thing I should be doing right now, I should be copy-pasting the code that generates, like,"
8420720,8423040," tones and stuff like that into that generator."
8423040,8430320," Not fuzzing around how do I fucking pass one number from one place to another class."
8430320,8434880," Like, this is not what should I be thinking about."
8434880,8437840," I should be thinking about, okay, how do I generate frequencies?"
8437840,8439920," Okay, so what's the amplitude and stuff like that?"
8439920,8441280," The actually important stuff."
8441280,8442240," Right."
8442240,8444240," This is not what I should be thinking about."
8444240,8447360," Fuck you, whoever designed that."
8447360,8450560," Seriously, I'm not even joking."
8450560,8454880," Like, you're making me waste time on things that are not important."
8454880,8457920," They're not important when I'm working with the audio API."
8457920,8463120," What's important is thinking about samples, frequencies, how I mix them, all the math."
8463120,8463440," Right."
8463440,8466560," Because if I use this API, this is what I want to be thinking about."
8466560,8469360," Not about how to pass a number from one place to another."
8469360,8470720," Because I'm using a shitty language."
8470720,8474160," So, I don't know."
8474160,8476080," That is sad."
8476080,8478800," That is sad reality of current tech."
8478800,8480160," But anyways."
8480160,8483760," This API is all about logistics."
8483760,8484000," Yeah."
8484000,8486640," So, this logistics stuff is so goddamn insane."
8486640,8489600," It's also like that in GPU APIs."
8489600,8490000," Right."
8490000,8492400," So, it's all about logistics of things."
8492400,8498640," Only AI can handle this API mess."
8498640,8504720," So, imagine like creating such a huge mess."
8504720,8505600," Right."
8505600,8509280," That you need a literal like AGI to manage it."
8509280,8513440," Where if you just were sane in designing your systems,"
8513440,8518320," you wouldn't need to waste time on creating such an overcomplicated system in the first place to manage it."
8518320,8523760," It's just like complexity for the sake of complexity."
8523760,8528560," But maybe that's considered progress."
8528560,8531680," So, I think we already talked about that."
8531680,8534720," The progress is actually measured in amount complexity."
8534720,8535920," Right."
8535920,8539440," So, the more complexity you have, the more progress you have somehow."
8539440,8539760," Right."
8539760,8542000," That's the definition, the more definition of progress."
8542000,8543840," More complexity."
8543840,8547600," Whatever produces more complexity means it's progressive."
8547600,8549440," Anyways."
8549440,8552160," So, yeah."
8552160,8554560," We need to figure out how to work with this shit."
8554560,8556960," So, I also don't really know properties of JavaScript."
8558480,8560400," So, parameter descriptors."
8560400,8563680," Okay."
8563680,8567040," So, let me try to maybe copy paste this thing."
8569040,8570720," So, what we're going to have in here."
8570720,8574560," So, there's also port."
8574560,8575760," Some sort of message port."
8575760,8577200," I don't fucking know what it is."
8577200,8579520," So, I suppose all of that stuff is custom."
8579520,8580080," Right."
8580080,8582960," So, a rate."
8582960,8585120," And I suppose it's going to be zero."
8585120,8588080," Parameter descriptors."
8588080,8590160," Getter."
8590160,8592160," But there's also setter, isn't it?"
8592160,8596000," So, it's used to populate."
8596000,8596400," Ah."
8596400,8600720," It's going to be used to populate some settings that I then can set."
8600720,8604400," Okay."
8604400,8606400," All right."
8606400,8610320," So, I really need to."
8610320,8611920," Like, I don't want to read this wall of text."
8611920,8612960," But apparently, you have to."
8612960,8616240," Because it's so clustrified and complicated that you have to read that."
8616240,8617680," Creation."
8617680,8617920," Okay."
8617920,8620400," So, the read-only parameter property."
8620400,8621120," Available."
8621120,8621440," Node."
8621440,8625680," Interface returns the associated parameter map."
8625680,8626080," That is."
8626080,8629760," A map-like collection of audio paramed objects."
8629760,8632320," They're instantiated during creation of underlying"
8632320,8635840," according to the parameter descriptor static getter."
8635840,8639680," So, audio paramed map object contains audio paramed instances."
8639680,8645120," they can be automated in the same way with the audio note and their calculated process"
8645120,8653520," secretion of usage all right all right all right uh-huh now we can change the gain"
8653520,8661440," the current time so but it's not set value at time"
8664080,8672480," there's no value at time so i would expect wait i think i understand what it is"
8672480,8683520," value at time this is a description of a single math of a single power oh my god"
8683520,8688480," holy this is a description of a single parameter"
8688480,8692720," prime oh you fucking piece dead snack"
8692720,8697600," okay i see"
8697600,8702800," i don't want to do that this long um"
8702800,8705440," all right"
8705440,8712880," so i thought it's just like this okay i see what this photo is going on"
8712880,8723200," here is so custom gain uh um a rate default value 48 000 uh mean"
8723200,8728080," but it's a parameter it's it's parameter that you tweak"
8728080,8737680," it's a parameter that you tweak is there any way to just get the frame rate the current sort of frame"
8737680,8743360," rate is there any way to do that i don't see it honestly"
8743360,8750400," that's kind of annoying um"
8750400,8756800," can i throw maybe console log this"
8758560,8761680," i want to see what's this thing is capable of um"
8761680,8768320," throw new error"
8768320,8772160," break okay"
8772160,8779680," that's not enough i would like to see something more interesting than that"
8781360,8783120," and the chromium can do that better"
8783120,8787440," uh maybe chromium can do that better"
8787440,8794560," uh-huh okay so thank you so you can only have port"
8794560,8800160," uh-huh prototype port get port"
8802320,8808560," mm-hmm nothing particularly useful i don't see it at least"
8808560,8812240," audio worker processor"
8812240,8825040," how are you supposed to generate like"
8832320,8838560," this is like a very little information because i want to know the rate"
8838560,8844640," uh is there any way to know the rate okay so maybe we should ask chat gpt or whatever because this is"
8844640,8852400," bizarre uh right how do we get the sample rate uh log sample rate there is no sample rate anywhere in here"
8854000,8861680," sample rate where where is the sample rate i don't see it there's a bunch of globals what"
8869680,8870240," fuck off"
8870240,8875440," what a shitty fucking system like"
8875440,8884800," it's it's literally fucking job security"
8884800,8895040," who designed this who designed this excuse me"
8899680,8900960," uh"
8900960,8903120," so do they say that anywhere simple"
8903120,8904880," right"
8904880,8907040," sample"
8907040,8909520," i don't even if i can say anything anywhere"
8909520,8912400," it's fucking not even seen"
8912400,8925680," kgb is actually after me um so"
8926640,8929040," this is absolutely fucking crap um but anyway"
8929040,8935120," so and funny shit actually that typescript doesn't have any typing for all that"
8935120,8939040," um right it just doesn't have any of that stuff okay"
8939040,8946000," um all right so let's actually so now i have at least sample right thank you very much holy"
8946000,8953200," shit uh now let's go and try to port like i was spending so much freaking time"
8954000,8960000," just to find this thing like how many people work with this api or start to work with this api"
8960000,8966240," like multiply like my wasted time by the amount of people who have to work with this api and it's"
8966240,8968960," just like it's insane um"
8968960,8979040," um one streamer only or okay nobody works with that anyway that's why it's fine to have a shitty api"
8980400,8987920," i see i see i see anyways so let's just generate some sounds i suppose right so this is basically"
8987920,8993680," what we want to have uh right so we want to be generating some tones semi-tones and stuff like that"
8993680,9000320," so i'm going to copy paste that to the synthesizer all right finally we're starting to work with shits"
9000320,9013280," and uh in here i'm just like um yeah i'm just generated shits i suppose the way i work is actually"
9018400,9023840," what if i just generate it in the output what if i just do that"
9023840,9029120," and"
9029120,9038080," yeah so i do that into the channel so the thing we want to do is that uh and"
9039760,9048240," we just do we just do we just do that for each channel apparently uh-huh i see so we just do that"
9048240,9049280," for each channel"
9049280,9054320," okay so it's that"
9054320,9057040," that"
9065760,9071440," okay okay uh so now let's see if it's going to work"
9071440,9084080," it is incorrect uh but it is producing sounds constantly which is good uh right so because"
9084080,9092000," we're not like properly measuring time and everything so it basically generates uh like a bunch of um samples"
9092000,9097920," on each process which are not properly connected with each other and that's why there's this buzzing noise"
9097920,9102480," right so it's not properly connected so that's why uh but that's fine at least we have something"
9102480,9106720," finally current frame seems to be the offset from the sample this is actually kind of cool so maybe"
9106720,9116320," this is what we have to do um right a current frame we can pass current frame there so sample rate"
9116960,9123520," since we kind of have globals in here we don't really have to pass them anywhere all right so"
9123520,9132640," this is what we can do so fox sample rate for fox sample rate so it's only here that is going"
9132640,9140080," to complain um right so let's try to uh refresh that one more time and"
9141520,9151520," you can't hear that yet but now you can right uh so cool that also means that we can now do something"
9151520,9160240," like this current frame plus i and that should smooth everything out hopefully we'll see how it goes"
9161840,9163840," um"
9163840,9172160," fuck you who designed this api"
9172160,9178000," fuck you and i see you tomorrow thank you for designing it so i can use a proper audio api in a"
9178000,9185120," browser fuck you and thank you uh that's everything i have to say to whoever designed this api thank you and"
9185120,9185840," pop you"
9185840,9197440," i'm joking by the way software development is hard don't get me wrong software development is hard i"
9197440,9198160," understand that"
9198160,9208640," um all right so it's cool so we can we can actually work with all of that um"
9210160,9215120," so yeah how can we now pass some"
9215120,9224400," information into this thing um well i mean we don't have to pass any information"
9224400,9235200," we can now port this entire into web assembly that's what we can do my friend that's what we can do we"
9235200,9240240," can port this entire to web assembly um so specifically we probably want to port"
9240240,9247680," um generate tone function so we are generating semi-tones right so let's port this entire section"
9247680,9253040," this entire section to uh web assembly i think it's going to be interesting to do that"
9253040,9261840," right um okay so we're going to create synth c3 um right we're doing web assembly c3 by the way"
9261840,9266800," uh with web assembly and shit because i think it's doable within the stream uh right so and once we"
9266800,9272640," have that thing in web assembly the research is going to be kind of complete because if we store"
9272640,9280880," uh all of these samples within web assembly module and keep track of them and stuff like that um"
9280880,9288640," yeah so essentially we solve the problem the only kind of a problem that i have in here is that"
9290000,9293920," it's kind of unclear if this thing is going to be in separate module"
9293920,9297600," how exactly we're going to pass information to the sound module"
9297600,9302720," how exactly do we pass information to the sound module so there should be a way to"
9302720,9306960," to do that"
9313920,9321840," it's around you misunderstood my question uh right so how do i tell something to"
9321840,9328800," that module that's a very interesting question bomper m1 it's through parameters i don't want"
9328800,9336800," to be using parameters so the worklets yeah so how do you get information any kind of information into the"
9336800,9342160," worklet through mess ah this is a separate worker right"
9342160,9347600," they are in a separate worker so that means you can send messages"
9351920,9363920," by a port yeah there's a port there i remember"
9363920,9375200," um so what's what's up with port message port uh so this is a api represents one of the message channels"
9375200,9390000," i see i can see how it works so how my god oh i'm this should give me hemorrhoids holy"
9390000,9403280," can i okay so color change color uh um background chooser"
9408000,9422800," all right i hate the architecture that i have to create just to play some sound in the same way"
9422800,9430960," just a second ah i can't properly map yeah so here's the interesting thing if you have a tablet"
9430960,9437040," right and you have two monitors the entirety of the tablet is actually mapped on two on both of the"
9437040,9442720," monitors simultaneously right so i move from left part to the right part and i'm actually on the"
9442720,9449280," second pointer right now so it's kind of annoying because of that by the way uh i have a special script"
9449280,9456800," that kind of fixes that in my dot files just a second so there's a dot files bin and it's a map of wacom"
9456800,9462160," right so what it does it just maps the output of the wacom to the first monitor which is like a"
9462160,9469760," you know 190p uh the the main one that i have in here uh right so and what i have to do i have to"
9469760,9478800," periodically like call this mapping script uh and it actually maps everything properly in fact mapping can"
9479680,9488160," basically break at any point for whatever reason and because of that i think in i3 i have yeah i have a"
9488160,9494720," special special key in here so i can basically call that script and remap it i think the problem here is"
9494720,9502480," that it's not um it's not in my dot bin folder or whatever the yeah it's not in my dot bin folder"
9502480,9510640," because it was not deployed properly and it was not deployed properly uh because i commented yeah i"
9510640,9517680," commented it out because i forgot that i needed this script right right so let me redeploy that uh super"
9517680,9524160," quick uh okay so the the script was successfully deployed as you can see it's deployed in my home"
9524160,9531360," folder so now i can actually use them um right so just xorg thing yeah so there's no such problem in the"
9531360,9542560," wayland i don't believe that wayland is one huge problem uh so you want to debate me um all right"
9543680,9554320," so essentially we have something like index maybe even maybe even darker is that this is a bad background"
9554320,9560400," i hate this background is there something even darker black background okay so that means i can at least"
9560400,9569680," do something like this okay this is perfect actually all right so we have an index mts right so the index"
9570640,9582000," mts and it actually calls to the main sort of game right so the main sort of game wasm right the game is"
9582000,9589760," written in wasm so this is basic architecture that we have then we have a separate processor separate audio"
9589760,9600080," worklet for working with sounds right so it's like a sound uh dot mts but because you want"
9600640,9609360," uh performance while you're working with sound we also have a sound uh dot wasm right dot wasm and"
9609360,9616800," this thing calls to that and the index mts actually calls to that right so these two things are both"
9616800,9624240," going to be written in the same language right so that means they come from game uh game c3 and this one"
9624240,9632480," comes from sound uh sound c3 so we have two modules two separate modules both of which we compile to"
9632480,9638640," wasm which are called by the corresponding uh javascript or typescript stuff and stuff like that doesn't"
9638640,9645120," really matter because of how fucking browsers work these things are completely separated from each other"
9645120,9652320," they don't share any address space or anything like that c3 is a successor to c it's a programming language"
9652320,9658000," uh so if you want to know what is c3 uh you may look it up in here"
9658000,9664160," uh yeah this one so we're doing native development in this language"
9666000,9672880," uh we're doing native language and developing in this language right so you they can't share anything"
9672880,9678320," so that means if the game wants to play a sound it cannot directly ask this thing because this"
9678320,9684960," thing effectively runs not only in a separate thread it runs in a separate fucking process or in our case"
9684960,9692160," in a separate worker so what the game has to do to initiate playing a sound it has to"
9693600,9703840," basically call to javascript you can call from wasm to javascript directly so this thing see while being"
9703840,9712720," called should send a message to the worker right it sends the message to the worker and the worker"
9712720,9719920," upon receiving the message should call the wasm function that schedules the sample that you want to play"
9723120,9729680," schedules the sample that you want to play and then while process callback is called it slowly plays"
9729680,9741120," that sample but here is an interesting thing um this is the architecture the future architecture of the"
9741120,9750080," game that we're going to want to have right so that's that's the thing okay uh but what if it's the game"
9751200,9758640," that actually inside stores all the sound uh binary binary sounds so looking at the architecture it would"
9758640,9765120," make sense right it would make sense that you bake all of the sound data all of the sound assets into the"
9765120,9774800," sound dot wasm right but that means the game should actually only know the indices of these samples that are"
9774800,9782240," baked into sound wasm and only send the indices that it wants to schedule but at the same time like i want"
9782240,9788400," this thing to be dynamic right so i want this thing to be like written once and just generic enough so it"
9788400,9795520," doesn't care about what kind of sounds it's playing right i want to keep the binary data within the game"
9795520,9800880," and then be able to say okay so here's the binary data to blend that binary data to play it in here"
9800880,9808800," so essentially what we have to do developing here we have to develop a like sort of sound api"
9809360,9818320," where the game calls a function in index mts and gives it the binary data and says okay register this"
9818320,9826880," binary data as sound it registers it as it sound effectively sending that binary data to sound mts"
9826880,9832880," and to sound wasm and stuff like that so it then stores it and remembers okay that's this sample right"
9832880,9840640," and then it returns an id and that's id by which you are uh basically uh referring to that sample"
9840640,9849920," and only then while after game is has registered the sound it can send these associated ids of that"
9849920,9856560," sound so then they can be uh scheduled and played by that module it's almost like"
9858320,9865760," web encourages you to do these kind of like you have no choice by design this kind of"
9865760,9876960," uh if you feel adventurous you could hack c3 compiler to emit multi-threaded game wasm that"
9876960,9882960," runs can you do multi-threading in wasm already is that possible in wasm already or is it just"
9882960,9889200," experimental like i'm not using experimental features is it experimental or is it like a real thing"
9889200,9896480," i don't know about game def is complex these days it's probably due to the gpu like apis"
9896480,9908240," let me check okay i see uh web assembly i'm not waiting why are we checking web assembly uh multi-threading"
9910800,9913040," uh multi-thread oh by the way"
9913040,9921280," anyways"
9921280,9928160," so it's in all browsers i see"
9928160,9937600," um honestly it will be kind of interesting to do a separate trim on multi-threading and wasm okay i'm not"
9937600,9942400," gonna touch multi-threading and wasm because i know nothing about it uh we're gonna have a separate"
9942400,9951440," stream on that uh right just exploring multi-threading and wasm yeah in any case in any case so"
9951440,9960960," let's go ahead and finish off with generating the sound actually on c3 side"
9963520,9972160," let's go ahead and do that uh so how we're going to be approaching that so since c3 um so let me maybe"
9972160,9982480," create a function so fn void generate um generate tone semitone right so this is what is called semitone"
9982480,9990800," so i suppose it's going to accept float uh right so this is samples and also it's going to accept samples size"
9991600,9999360," and uh yeah also sample rate the yeah so it also needs the sample rate this this is kind of important"
9999360,10006400," because it's global in here but you have to pass it there as well uh so you size current frame um"
10006400,10014560," so samples length you know what samples is a little bit computer confusing let's actually call it something"
10014560,10024160," like output output output output size current frame uh right sample rate and what else do we have in"
10024160,10029600," here and it's a semi-tone which is also your size right that's basically what we have in here i'm"
10029600,10034000," going to say that it's going to be external function right so because we're expert exporting it out of the"
10034000,10040320," wasm and we mark it as wasm i don't really know why exactly you have to do that in c3 uh but that's"
10040320,10050640," something that you have to do um and so since it's a semi-tone um well i mean let's also"
10050640,10060960," just create a generate tone uh generate tone it's pretty much the same thing except well i mean this"
10060960,10063920," this is not how we do that by the way this is how it has to be done"
10063920,10074720," so and this one is actually float hz right this is a float hz"
10076160,10080960," uh now what i do in here i just call um"
10080960,10095840," let's call the generate hz i keep confusing myself actually but uh nhz in here is simply that"
10095840,10105920," all right interestingly so there's probably a pal in the math library of c3 so let's"
10105920,10111840," actually import std math uh-huh so that's pretty good we're not going to be expert in this one we're"
10111840,10119360," going to be only expert in semitone um and let's just grab this entire stuff uh like this"
10119360,10131600," let's just grab it okay so this what we're doing here we iterating output size so this is output size"
10132160,10140160," so then we're generating t and it has to be flowed so here is the u size plus u size plus divided by"
10140160,10145200," rate but in that case we want to actually end up with a floating point so i'm going to cast this one"
10145200,10150640," to floating point all right so in here we have a cosine uh all right so we're going to grab it from"
10150640,10156560," the math library this one we're also going to grab it from the math library um so all that is going to"
10156560,10163840," end up being kind of double but we want to specifically work with floats uh so i suppose"
10163840,10169360," let's actually do that in double and then convert it to float all right so all of that stuff is going"
10169360,10176080," going to end up being float um and this is actually output all right so that's what we have in here"
10176080,10180720," uh that's what we have in here"
10180720,10188080," all right so it looks good looks gucci looks"
10189360,10196800," uh if mass cosine needs to be accepted from the back and forth uh overhead may massively slow"
10196800,10202160," everything down i think uh c3 has its own implementation of cosine if i'm not mistaken"
10202160,10208320," the last time i kind of checked it had something uh all right just a sec"
10208320,10220000," rep rn yeah oh look at that it has a built-in awesome wait doesn't that mean that it uses the"
10220000,10221760," fog"
10221760,10230320," we'll see we'll see we'll see okay what we want to do we want to actually try to compile this into i think"
10231600,10238480," uh okay so let's create a make file uh and in here i want to just do a synth um wasm and it depends on"
10238480,10249360," since c3 so let me go to coil build.js compile run so how we are building this entire so"
10249360,10258160," first of all we're not relocating any memory c3c compile uh-huh target is wasm wasm"
10260000,10266000," all right so then we do a bunch of optimizations no stuff no whatever whatever whatever whatever"
10266000,10274640," whatever let's remove that and also do that so i'm just basically reviewing the flags uh trustful"
10274640,10281520," we don't really need trustful so that's whatever uh synth this is the output so we export in the tables"
10281520,10285520," right so export in the tables"
10288720,10300800," mm-hmm and replace this this and uh just the synth since c3 right so that should create a wasm module"
10300800,10305600," if we did everything correctly okay current frame it doesn't like current frame because i forgot to"
10305600,10317360," rename that current frame uh-huh all right are you ready all right so double yeah okay okay it cannot be"
10317360,10327280," explicitly convert it to float or whatever um so let me see let's explicitly say that this is f and this is f as"
10327280,10337360," well right this is floats in the compound and that produced the wasm that's how simple it is to do wasm"
10337360,10346400," development development in c3 just a single wasm module look at that look at that look at that look at that"
10346400,10356720," look at that all right so um one of the things i want to do actually in here is uh since what i want to"
10356720,10365600," take a look at the internal stuff in what uh so it's going to depend on wasm wasm to what wasn't to what"
10365600,10371920," wasn't what wasn't what wasn't what uh and let's go all right so let's recompile this into i think"
10371920,10383920," now let's take a look at what and see what it uh wants and what it exports you"
10391760,10406560," anyways uh that's besides the point right it doesn't have to be super fast it has to work"
10406560,10411520," right so we can try to optimize it a little bit better so what it exports it exports memory and"
10411520,10416880," generates some item right so that's fine most importantly it also generates initialize right"
10416880,10422000," so this is the function that we have to call right so because it initializes the runtime uh"
10422000,10428960," i'm more concerned about pow pow is if two we can get rid of the power honestly okay okay okay"
10428960,10436000," so i agree with that honestly i kind of agree with that uh so let's go ahead and just get rid of"
10436000,10442320," this choice let's get rid of this choice we can pre-calculate why are we calculated it with pow"
10444240,10457760," i can just simply do something like float hz 440 f just for each use size"
10457760,10464400," semi to plus plus i hz by the way"
10470960,10476560," that's a good point that's a good point that's a good point we can dramatically simplify this"
10476560,10484720," intention it doesn't have to be that complicated okay so we only depend on cosine and we can even"
10484720,10488560," get rid of the cosine as well all right so just like not that big of a deal"
10488560,10498720," um well in terms of experts we have we have that uh so i want to start maybe with a kind of a slightly"
10498720,10506800," different thing so let me create test js all right so i'm going to start with node i think"
10506800,10513360," it's going to be a little bit easier so require oh and yeah you will have to fetch it yeah so that's"
10513360,10522640," that's kind of annoying but whatever um so require so fs fs read file sync and what we're doing we're just"
10522640,10533280," reading synth wasm uh and we can console log it super quick uh node test js okay so here's the bytes"
10533280,10542240," but then we can do wasm assembly instantiate right and so it's actually asynchronous right so"
10542800,10550640," we want to do something like we want to do something like a weight a const wasm like so uh-huh and let's"
10550640,10561280," do console logger like so async uh-huh and let's just call this interesting okay so it's complaining"
10561280,10572080," probably about the lack of cosine uh yeah wait web assembly what was it you didn't see that um"
10572080,10578560," all right so error yeah so we need to have uh an environment"
10578560,10585840," uh right so environment so it's going to complain about the lack of course sign yeah there we go so"
10585840,10593520," complaints about the lack of cosine uh for now we can just do cosine math cosine whatever whatever it's"
10593520,10602240," fine it's fine so then uh instance experts all right so here are all of our experts that we have"
10602240,10607600," in here all right initialize and whatnot uh and i suppose the first thing we want to do we want to"
10607600,10612480," call initialize because it calls all the constructors all the initializers and stuff like that it's kind"
10612480,10617200," of important if you start calling functions into c3 without calling this stuff you're going to be"
10617200,10621680," calling into an initialized state so everything's going to be broken right it's very important to call"
10621680,10628640," this thing first um right so we have a initialized module and everything um so we can basically start"
10628640,10639360," working with that the question is how do we put that into man how do we put that into because it's"
10639360,10649680," asynchronous isn't it um yeah that's that's bizarre all right so since mts"
10649680,10656960," uh i suppose we can create a constructor all right okay so let's imagine that we're going"
10656960,10664320," to create a constructor short uh so it complains about uh about something in here uh constructor"
10666560,10674000," oh yeah i have a little problem um just a sec for the right must contain super call a super call"
10674000,10680960," okay so that's what you want all right can i have asynchronous constructors is that a thing"
10680960,10684640," fuck you all right so"
10687440,10695120," i suppose i suppose"
10695120,10701440," so you could register the worklet after the wasm is low yeah i suppose what i have to do in here and i"
10701440,10707680," fucking hate by the way but it feels like i have to load wasm in the main thread"
10710080,10719760," um so you could register worklet after the wasm is yeah so i feel like it has to be main in the main thread"
10719760,10727120," and then passed to um to the worklet"
10727120,10736240," so here it has to be fetched by the way right i think it's instantiates is it instantiated i think it's"
10736240,10741440," streaming yeah it has to be streaming specifically if we do that in browser it has to be like that"
10741440,10744240," um okay"
10744240,10750160," i don't see how you could pass it but worth a shot"
10750160,10752720," honestly"
10752720,10760240," i can do that completely outside okay let me see let me see let me see um"
10763200,10767360," that's a good point i think i know i think i know how to do that"
10767360,10779520," oh i it makes sense yeah it totally makes sense chat chat it totally makes sense everything's fine"
10779520,10780640," so just a sec"
10780640,10788880," let or maybe even undefined doesn't matter so all of that"
10790800,10795600," um so is it i wonder if it's a register processor asynchronous or not"
10795600,10800560," uh right so in here we essentially just do that"
10800560,10808800," we initialize everything and then register the processor okay um web audio api"
10808800,10820080," use get in register doesn't seem to be is there any okay so here's the global scope this is very useful"
10820800,10827520," register processor uh register processor does it return anything none okay but that's fine i suppose"
10827520,10836880," right so i just wanted to make sure that doesn't return anything um okay when i'm registering the thing"
10836880,10848000," yeah it's already asynchronous look at that it's already asynchronous so i suspect it's gonna wait until"
10848000,10852320," okay this thing you know you know um you know i don't know if you know you know i don't know"
10852320,10856320," this is my hypothesis but i'm not 100 sure so it complains about something in here i"
10856320,10860720," uh declaration of statement is ex is expected okay"
10860720,10866240," yeah there we go so so this is my hypothesis"
10867280,10871280," and so that means you know and so that means you can safely now use wasm in here"
10871280,10878800," i think i think you can we can even test that out so i can just do console log"
10878800,10884640," um maybe even throw new error"
10884640,10891280," wasm instance experts like so"
10895280,10899840," that actually makes sense that and ironically makes sense right i'm gonna remove all of that"
10899840,10904320," stuff because it's already got ported into wasm uh so i don't care about the errors anymore right"
10904320,10910480," so it's just like a waste of time to focus on them um right and all of that stuff is also gonna"
10910480,10918800," go away for now um all right so i guess that's that's how we do that i think this is how we do that"
10920240,10926720," okay so let's take a look uh let's go so a known audio named synth"
10926720,10942800," it didn't await it didn't fucking await properly"
10944960,10956000," um"
10956000,10964960," and then i think and then is not gonna help"
10964960,10970160," i feel like then is literally not gonna help because it's not what is happening in here"
10972800,10976080," um i think it is not going to help"
10976080,10983120," all right so do you recompile everything"
10983120,10989680," all right let's go um yeah it's it's not about that it is not about that"
10993600,10997520," damn that sucks i think i understand what is going on"
10997520,11004640," but i have no idea how to resolve that"
11004640,11008560," so about fetch not being defined"
11008560,11012640," fetch is not you can't fetch from the worker"
11016000,11021040," wait wait wait maybe you have to await in here this thing do you have to await this stuff i think"
11021040,11026320," it just accept okay so it has to be promised but this thing can be promised like so that's fine"
11026320,11041440," wait you can't have fetch in worker"
11041440,11054800," okay okay okay okay so what's the answer though"
11054800,11072160," what's the answer though can you do fetch in in the web worker or not uh performance is one that i don't care"
11072160,11083520," it is a simple can i access them don't have access to them okay so that's the one you can"
11083520,11091360," do you speak about fetch anything interesting so i'm going to present and how you can run fetch in"
11091360,11097840," web work and why you want to do that right so even though you will most likely not see performance"
11097840,11098800," benefit of running but"
11098800,11105280," this is useless article it just like goes around about nothing so people are talking about self"
11105280,11107760," but i didn't think self is going to help in here"
11107760,11116240," yeah all right which is in the window and window okay i see that explains it finally somebody"
11116240,11124000," who understands the matter um yeah so that means it has to be fetched uh in the index all right so"
11124000,11129680," again why am i thinking about all of that"
11129680,11136320," i should be thinking about samples and math and stuff like that"
11138720,11144400," anyways um can we pass a message"
11144400,11150640," so can we pass wasm instance with a message"
11150640,11159920," right so because there is a port and how do you send uh things to you know to a web worker"
11161840,11171440," um okay so i have synth node so that's one thing i have port okay let's have port"
11171440,11177120," uh so probably through this port right i'm probably sending shit through this port"
11177120,11185680," okay so read-only property of the interface returns a system that can be used to communicate between the"
11185680,11192240," node and it's associated audio okay that's that's very cool i see i see so what can we do in here um"
11192240,11198640," can i send i don't want to start shits i just want to send okay so message"
11198640,11208560," uh-huh post message okay so it's a post message and post message um post message also accepts"
11209840,11220560," uh array of transfer okay so it accepts message simply uh-huh um all right so i can just do something like"
11220560,11223760," um kind"
11223760,11234160," wasm right it's causing wasm and wasm is"
11234160,11238320," all right so that's what we can do"
11239840,11248400," uh and then in the synth processor i suppose in the constructor this is what we have to do in"
11248400,11258880," constructor so this is super then um i just do this port uh on message"
11258880,11266800," so it accepts two things it accepts also message event uh but it's also this right so that means i"
11266800,11270960," can do something like uh this stuff"
11270960,11279600," so message event and it contains the data what i want to do is probably"
11279600,11287120," data and also wasm in data so then i can use that so and essentially"
11287120,11293760," while wasm is undefined we don't do anything"
11295760,11301280," so i don't remember what is boolean i suppose it's maybe error or something like that but yeah"
11301280,11307840," so that's probably how we want to do that"
11307840,11314400," but it's not even it's not even that right so"
11314400,11321200," it's not even that because data is like an object right so it's an object so we have to be"
11321200,11328560," really careful how we post and send all of that stuff all right so um yeah so let's actually see"
11328560,11330480," what is going to happen um"
11336720,11345440," unknown audio work let's uh what did i do wrong"
11345440,11350240," um so i broke something"
11350240,11356480," since mgs did it not recompile properly or what"
11360480,11367840," and it's totally fine did you remove a weight i think i did yeah thank you so much thank you thank you"
11367840,11381280," thank you thank you uh all right uh-huh instant subject cannot be"
11381280,11394640," uh"
11394640,11401760," it cannot be cloned okay okay"
11403680,11410800," example in the chat uh people shilling their projects and stuff okay um let me see"
11410800,11416400," what is this work let uh"
11418400,11428160," are you fucking oh my oh my goodness you literally instant oh it's disgusting it's disgusting"
11428160,11437120," example is good don't get me wrong thank you so much this is actually very smart and i really"
11437120,11443120," appreciate you for showing me that thank you very much but the fact that you have to do it like that"
11446720,11454080," holy fucking shit holy and people work at web and see no fucking problem with that"
11454080,11461600," so again my reaction is not targeted to you the author of that example thank you so much thank you"
11461600,11467280," so much for helping me thank you so much for conveying the idea my reaction is toward web and"
11467280,11474240," toward javascript it's absolutely fucking disgusting it's a crime against humanity holy fucking shit anyways"
11475120,11483280," i see i see so basically your idea is you literally sending bytes to a different worker and then"
11483280,11492800," uh let me actually grab your example uh right and i'm gonna actually put it in the"
11492800,11499600," in the description right so it's a good example it's a good example all right"
11501600,11512320," it's disgusting holy shit uh no js no problem yeah exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly interesting"
11512320,11520000," interesting though interesting interesting um all right so let me see how you send the data right so"
11525200,11535040," so you're literally sending bytes but can you can you send promise in there uh yeah yeah so it's you"
11535040,11538800," basically do instantiation but yeah"
11538800,11552640," work let processor and index html so how you're registering it uh so when you post byte code"
11553520,11561040," you just take array buffer i see you just fetch it you take array buffer and you literally send it there"
11561040,11571200," i see i see i see i see cool that's let's suppose this is what we have to do as well"
11582480,11588080," i just like i just like i'm tired of renting today honestly like it's just i have no juice to rent"
11588080,11595200," anymore uh i'm just trying to do a thing that is relatively straightforward in uh system development"
11595200,11601440," right in native system development it's not easy it's a little bit complicated yeah so you have to do"
11601440,11606000," like you have to deal a little bit with the of the sound apis of the operating system"
11606000,11613120," it's okay it's understandable but it's not on that level where was that bad that it's not even funny"
11613120,11620720," exactly it's not even funny i'm trying to like a give it ironic spin but i can't do that it's it's just"
11620720,11628720," bad right where are all of the adults where they are where where are they uh it's just like"
11629600,11636880," who's responsible for this like it's somebody has to be responsible for this kind of thing like this"
11636880,11646080," is a huge mess who's gonna clean up this entire mess i'm like man um i'm still surprised that this"
11646080,11652960," is the most popular popular language this is because of the power of the distribution capabilities of the"
11652960,11661520," web right the fact that if you write a script in javascript you can very easily distribute it"
11661520,11668320," pretty much on any computer on planet earth almost instantly this is such a powerful powerful thing"
11668320,11675920," that even such a shitty language as javascript cannot ruin that and cannot kill that so in fact because"
11675920,11685520," of how good web is at distribution you can make javascript infinitely shitty it can just straight up go to"
11685520,11695520," infinity i think but maybe there is some point some tipping point after which it is actually easier to"
11695520,11702240," do more complex distribution than doing web development like at all maybe there is some tipping point somewhere"
11702240,11710080," but i'm not sure actually i have a hypothesis that there is such point um but we haven't seen it so far"
11710080,11718880," honestly i haven't seen so far like a situation when people said yeah distribution ability of web is great"
11718880,11726560," but the platform is so fucking shit that we're willing to do more complex distribution and it's actually"
11726560,11731760," worth it i've never seen that situation before because of that i doubt that that point exists even"
11732800,11741040," uh so except game engine deaths exactly so you're probably guys talking about something else but game"
11741040,11747920," development uh games usually distributed through different means so and game distributions are already"
11747920,11758080," kind of solved by steam um so i don't know i suppose the way to kill web is to create a better distribution"
11758720,11765840," actually you can't kill web by making a better language because it's not about language you can kill"
11765840,11767440," on the web by making better distribution"
11767440,11775760," so wasm tries to improve the distribution wasm is a virtual machine it doesn't does nothing to the"
11775760,11779520," distribution it's a payload of the distribution it has nothing to do with distribution"
11780320,11787360," uh so the distribution has to be some sort of a package manager or something there's just like"
11787360,11794720," but what's interesting is that the package managers are usually used as power tools of the creators of"
11794720,11800560," the platforms right so you think microsoft will allow you to have like very powerful distribution on their"
11800560,11806480," platform well i mean it does kind of because of steam but this is because how powerful steam is they"
11806480,11814160," cannot just ignore that right you you you can't create another steam because nobody will let you do that"
11814160,11819360," unless you you are powerful enough to push it um so"
11819360,11829920," yeah interesting but anyway so let's actually try to do all of that stuff um so i want to get to the point where"
11830560,11838960," uh the sound the 440 hertz is generated in wasm module i want to get to this point on today's stream"
11838960,11845200," i think this is very much important right so to be able to get to that point um"
11845200,11856240," anyways so let's quickly try to do that uh so let me move uh it's already moving there right so here's the fetch"
11856960,11863920," and this is going to be your response so we're awaiting uh-huh and in a response you can take"
11863920,11871120," array buffer and array buffer also returns the promise right so that means this is basically byte code"
11871120,11882800," um right it will also await this entire thing in all honesty in all honesty i would like to so um"
11883600,11891120," so mts mts mts by the way who gave that example who gave that example uh"
11891120,11903280," so okay okay so is that you you are the author of this example right so because i don't know who's the"
11903280,11908960," author of that maybe you just copy paste it so who's the author of the example that suggested uh"
11910880,11916960," okay i will just want to give vip i don't know who whom i should give vip i guess i'm not gonna give vip"
11916960,11924960," all right uh so let me let me see so this is the data right so and on message"
11924960,11929520," uh i want to do the following thing"
11931280,11942640," um i know one inch oh okay so i see um okay we need to do the instantiation um"
11942640,11947840," so let's move the entire instantiation in here"
11951280,11960800," so bytecode just do that we connect to this entire thing and kind wasm and this one is going to be"
11960800,11969280," bytecode uh bytecode might as well maybe just do bytecode look at that all right that's pretty cool"
11971120,11978960," oh boy so uh it doesn't like me awaiting in here because a weight has no effect on this expression"
11978960,11988720," uh really uh because it's a function yeah let's go okay that's pretty cool so and in here in this synth"
11988720,11997040," uh in a synth when we receive the event for now i just want to log the data because i want to see what is"
11997040,12006480," going on there exactly uh all right so i just want to see what's going on there exactly and let me let me"
12006480,12020160," try let's go this part of the message is not a function that is not true"
12027040,12034400," what"
12034400,12039200," own message equal ah"
12039200,12044400," fuck i'm an idiot i'm already getting tired so as you can see right so"
12044400,12051200," it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't oh wait it worked holy shit it worked"
12052240,12057920," holy shit it worked holy fuck uh all right all right all right so we can finally instantiate this"
12057920,12067200," entire thing all right so let's instantiate it so environment uh data uh and this is basically bytecode"
12067200,12074480," right so this is the bytecode we can even do something like uh whatever um so then we initialize"
12074480,12079840," this entire thing and i want to just take a look at wasm uh in fact i want to reassign wasm in here"
12079840,12086560," so this one obviously has to be async uh uh uh and yep let's go"
12086560,12092640," environment is not defined"
12092640,12096800," understandable"
12100320,12104880," look at that"
12104880,12117040," look at that"
12117040,12125600," that's not enough my friend that's not enough um we have to allocate"
12127360,12133920," actually a little bit of data right because um the wasm can only generate chat within the wasm memory"
12133920,12134800," right"
12134800,12139840," uh and that's a huge problem right because"
12139840,12145040," you need to allocate a little bit of a memory"
12145040,12152880," generate it there and then um essentially copy it into the outputs and stuff like that"
12154080,12159440," luckily i already know how to do that because this is exactly what i did many many times in coil"
12159440,12167280," right uh so essentially the trick the trick that you we already have we're using temporary allocator"
12167280,12173040," we introduce uh a special function which is i think i'm going to steal that from coil"
12173680,12183040," so in coil in common c3 we have allocate uh temporary buffer so and essentially we're just exposing t calloc"
12183040,12188080," right so then javascript can allocate temporary memory"
12188080,12191440," it can allocate temporary pepper"
12191440,12200720," so we're exposing that uh and then there's also a function that resets temporary allocator maybe on each"
12200720,12204800," generation or something like that but we can also expose um you know"
12204800,12209360," cleaning up temporary memory so it's actually not that difficult to expose"
12209360,12216640," uh all right so this is what we want to put in here um so i suppose we don't have to do anything"
12216640,12221600," particularly special in there so you the javascript just have to provide the size in bytes"
12221600,12227680," uh all right and it will get a pointer within web assembly memory in which it can write and read and"
12227680,12234160," do some stuff and pass the pointer to that memory to web assembly stuff uh memory management in javascript"
12234160,12244160," exactly memory management in javascript so um yeah how can we even do that right if this thing"
12245840,12255920," does exist uh does exist uh so we generate semitone for each channel okay so this is that we have to"
12255920,12269920," copy stuff to you know float array or something okay um so i want to have a function um copy"
12271680,12282160," float32 to float32 array to wasm all right so this is what we're going to accept in here um and uh so"
12282160,12289520," this is just uh you know array maybe just array uh float32"
12291120,12298640," float32 array so we're really even have to copy it uh it's good it's complicated"
12298640,12308640," uh so the channel i'm thinking how i want to approach that instance experts allocate"
12308640,12316960," please allocate tempered rubber all right we have channel length right so here's the channel length"
12317920,12330320," uh and uh and we have something like float32 size maybe size of float32 which is going to be simply"
12330320,12344320," uh four right so we have that uh all right so and this is essentially wasm output right this is the wasm output"
12345920,12351280," cool cool then we call to this function"
12351280,12364480," wasm instance experts this um let's call it maybe output pointer output pointer output size"
12364480,12373840," so output size is the amount of these things it's actually channel length right so that's what it is"
12374880,12383520," so then we have current frame uh sample rate and semitone the semitone we're generating is actually"
12383520,12392400," zero right so that's how we do that so now uh is like everything is actually located in here so we have"
12392400,12404640," to do we have to construct new uh float32 array out of wasm instance experts memory buffer starting"
12404640,12413600," from output ptr and the amount of things we have in there right in terms of uh size right so it also"
12413600,12420000," has byte offset so we already provided byte offset and then the length uh the length is the channel channel"
12420000,12426720," length right so this is what we have in here and effectively what we have to do we have to take the"
12426720,12432000," and then we have to do that and set this entire thing so that will effectively copy the entire"
12432000,12437760," order array there that's how you have to do that welcome to web assembly"
12439440,12449520," um so yeah after that after that we have to reset um the memory effectively right so we have to reset the"
12449520,12458240," memory um but how can we even do that that's a good question so i suppose uh the way we do that is"
12460240,12462960," we have a function we have a function we can reset temp memory"
12462960,12477040," but it's a little bit complicated um so usually you reset the memory the following way uh temp mark"
12482160,12489920," so yeah there we go so you have a temporary mark which you acquire at the beginning of execution"
12489920,12498080," temp mark so yeah essentially you take the temporary allocator and this is the temporary mark"
12498080,12501520," and when you reset it you reset it to that specific mark"
12502880,12508560," so what i'm thinking is that i think i'm going to have a function that literally gives you temporary mark"
12508560,12512000," synth c3"
12512000,12517280," so use size temp mark"
12517280,12520480," we're going to just return that"
12520480,12524880," i'm just going to return that and"
12528960,12534960," ex-extern all right so this is going to be wasm uh-huh"
12534960,12543920," and then we can say reset temp mark uh we just accept the mark in here oh hi mark"
12543920,12549600," and this is going to be wasm"
12549600,12556960," and how do we even reset uh so just attempt reset"
12558240,12567680," like this like this so at the beginning here we do mark wasm instance experts temp"
12567680,12577120," mark uh-huh and then reset temp mark like so"
12577120,12587600," so that's basically how it works so you just acquire the current state of the temporary location you save"
12587600,12592080," it you do some shed that allocates some memory and then you reset back to this syntax step"
12592080,12600240," that's how it is done right that's how it's done this it is what it is right so but it's relatively"
12600240,12604800," fast way of allocating delegating memory and stuff like that so i've been doing this kind of stuff in"
12604800,12612800," coil all the time it works fine works fine trust me trust me bro and i think that's basically it honestly"
12612800,12618640," i think that's um basically um so since we can't really type check properly any of that stuff so"
12618640,12621840," i'm basically falling back to a dynamic language at this point so"
12621840,12630320," uh i don't freaking know anyway so let me actually bring this stuff down a little bit"
12630320,12637840," uh and i think we can start doing shit okay so we need to click um"
12637840,12652720," honestly actually uh first thing i want to do i want to save it uh wasm zero wasm zero and only then"
12653280,12664000," assign wasm to that uh okay did i forget to do something chats do you have to start uh synth node"
12664000,12670720," play does anybody remember if you have to do anything"
12670720,12677680," uh i need to double check yes you have to start yeah we already did so many modifications"
12678480,12688240," uh yeah that it doesn't really work like anymore okay so here is that um"
12688240,12696480," so we just connect it but it doesn't recompile yeah recompile wasn't the problem to recompile"
12696480,12702480," uh-huh thank you so much almost forgot yeah so there's a problem here um"
12704400,12714160," so temp mark all right everything seems to be working also this thing is recompiling constantly so"
12714160,12717840," we don't have to worry about that let's close some of these shits"
12717840,12725360," oh boy the wasm is outdated yeah nothing happened"
12733520,12746480," nothing happened so i don't even know let me see let me see let me see let me see let me see"
12746480,12758400," so i don't know we need to check if we ever get to this point let's do something like throw new error"
12760480,12762800," so do we get to this point anywhere"
12762800,12773600," no temp mark is not a function okay i see some errors uh i think i'm just a little bit tired i'm"
12773600,12780400," sorry so temp mark aha i never exported any of them okay so that's that's understandable so"
12780400,12782080," everything's fine everything's fine we can"
12782080,12787280," no i actually expected okay let's take a look at the what"
12789680,12797200," export export temp mark reset temp mark okay so i made some oopsie doopsies"
12797200,12806080," uh temp mark"
12806080,12808080," okay"
12808080,12816080," okay"
12817680,12820640," um"
12820640,12822480," i'm confused"
12822480,12829280," it's not a function catch this time i doubt that"
12829280,12838560," okay so let's take a look at the um um"
12838560,12845520," wasm my console log wasm instance"
12846560,12849120," exports let's take a look at that"
12849120,12852720," all right"
12852720,12855680," memory"
12855680,12857840," yeah that's that's bizarre"
12857840,12862160," what the hell is that"
12862160,12866000," this is"
12871440,12880000," what am i looking at"
12880000,12880560," what am i looking at"
12880560,12884960," this is insane"
12884960,12885360," like"
12885360,12888960," this is insane"
12888960,12889360," like"
12889360,12900640," is that okay so it's probably just uh you know uh firefox being firefox um all right"
12901440,12911840," uh what does it say uh what does it say uh what does it say error zero"
12911840,12915280," uh"
12915280,12916400," outputs zero"
12916400,12924240," yeah firefox is firefox something i think it's doing something incorrectly in here"
12924240,12930160," i think that that's what's going on so maybe okay so here's that i take array buffer"
12930160,12938480," i initialize the the context and stuff like that uh at the module and then i sent wasn't in there"
12939120,12940880," different than chrome yeah actually"
12940880,12943280," and ironically"
12943280,12944560," uh"
12944560,12951360," mm-hmm mark oh it's a mark zero okay"
12951360,12952800," um"
12952800,12954560," okay"
12954560,12961280," the problem is that i'm tired already so that's a huge problem because"
12963520,12964720," reset memory now"
12964720,12965520," reset memory now is not a function"
12965520,12969840," okay so that's understandable"
12969840,12971840," um"
12971840,12975200," but not really"
12975200,12978160," maybe memory"
12978160,12982080," should i don't know what what are you talking about it has nothing to do with memory"
12982080,12982320," um"
12982320,12985120," um"
12985120,12992000," this one"
12992000,12996080," this one"
12996080,12998400," it's the literally the same name"
12998400,13003440," literally the same name"
13005200,13010320," where is there is no reset temporary mark"
13010320,13013520," what are you guys talking about here it is"
13013520,13019440," two lines above two lines above what two lines above what it exists"
13019440,13022240," memory what's memory"
13024800,13033520," okay okay again i'm tired already cut me some slack got me some slack"
13033520,13035440," fucking yes"
13035440,13041600," it's generated in wasm it's fucking generated in wasm i'm telling you"
13041600,13042960," right"
13045040,13051120," so we can't even prove that that it generates in wasm i'm going to synth c3"
13051120,13062720," uh right so and then i suppose i'm rising the semitone so i'm going to add plus 10"
13062720,13068000," maybe plus 11 to the semitone within c3 within web assembly"
13068000,13074640," uh right so i'm recompiling the whole thing i'm recompiling the whole thing and i'm going to local"
13074640,13074960," host"
13074960,13077520," and it's now higher"
13077520,13087040," so we are in fact generating this entire shed in web assembly this is the crappiest api i've"
13087040,13089040," ever had a pleasure working with"
13089040,13094160," this is just the worst"
13094160,13103280," like i think low level like linux kernel driver infrastructure is not as convoluted as this"
13104240,13109760," this is in straight up insanity this is straight up insanity like"
13109760,13116640," and it doesn't even do anything that is impossible to do without all of that web crap"
13118320,13121360," i can do all of that shit very easily if you just"
13121360,13131120," the fucking browser the only thing this thing provides is just the distribution it just happened"
13131120,13139840," that all like all of that crapware is already installed on user machine and only that's why we keep using that shitty fucking api"
13141760,13145520," so yeah that's everything i have to say about this entire api"
13145520,13157120," um it's funny how every time i do like actual web technology stream i it ends up being a huge stream and a huge waste of time"
13157680,13166800," it is fucking insane like and like again i didn't do something i could have not done without web and"
13166800,13175440," without browser actually i'm i've done less right if i just strip off this crap where i could have done much more"
13176480,13183520," um so so it's so fucking bad it's insane bro it's fucking insane um"
13183520,13191040," so most of the problem with the api is that js has a single thread it so we need tons of work around yeah"
13191040,13194480," ah"
13194480,13202480," it's just disgusting mates okay so i got the gist so this is basically a prototype of the"
13202480,13205600," architecture it's not even full prototype of the architecture by the way"
13205600,13216000," we didn't develop an example where from other wasm module right from other wasm module from game c3"
13216000,13224880," i send out the information to index mts that sends that posts the message to this thing and then goes into the"
13224880,13232400," sound and does something like we haven't um developed that kind of thing right so this"
13232400,13237040," is like an entire fucking framework to do something that could have been done easily without the"
13237040,13246240," fucking browser it's just like it's it's freaking insane um it's not even js it's the whole platform"
13246240,13251520," uh would be as bad with any other language probably"
13251520,13260960," so yeah you still need to wait to control that and imagine the latency right so some event happened in the game"
13261840,13268240," so information about that event have to go through so many goddamn fucking layers just to get there"
13268240,13279200," it's like what the fuck it's just insanity but there's something for multi-threading in wasm"
13279200,13282720," right so there's something for multi-threading and wasn't that we probably need to explore"
13283840,13300240," uh don't you know about this topic but could you make your own better web api"
13300240,13308160," we already discussed that it's not about api it's not about javascript it's not about any of this"
13308160,13314000," uh it's about the availability of the platform"
13314000,13322880," all right so the platform is so available so readily available that the developers of this platform can"
13322880,13329360," treat the dev uh the their users as shit for as long as they want"
13329360,13335920," so the developers of the browsers the developers of javascript the developers of frameworks"
13335920,13346400," uh can literally just shed a diary beam on the users of the platforms and say what you're gonna do you're"
13346400,13351840," gonna switch to a different fucking plan you're gonna develop natively in the native you don't have such"
13351840,13361760," a good distribution fuck you and that's why it doesn't even matter like you can make better web api"
13362400,13369760," you can't because it's not about web api it's about who first managed to put the piece of software on"
13369760,13377360," everyone's computer that they control so it's about demarcating the territory it's about that it's not about"
13377360,13386160," better worse it's just like the the tech market is does not work it's not a competition of quality"
13387360,13391360," you guys don't fucking understand it's not a competition of quality it's a competition of power"
13391360,13397600," right so every time you criticize all the shitty api all these smug motherfuckers coming"
13397600,13402320," how about you make a better way of api oh god"
13402320,13408640," fucking god i'm a ratio ratio but the reality is it's not a competition of quality"
13408640,13413840," you can make a better api nobody fucking gives a shit it's a competition of power it's a competition of"
13413840,13420400," distribution it's a competition of who controls the platform it doesn't fucking matter it doesn't"
13420400,13428560," fucking matter motherfuckers it doesn't fucking matter so it's goddamn insane uh"
13428560,13438560," uh yeah"
13443840,13452320," anyways so we tried this thing around and i think it's for the most part manageable i guess right"
13452320,13459600," so this prototype kind of proves that it is possible i would like to do more experiments with it uh so"
13459600,13467280," but i think i already spent too much time uh working on this thing so i guess it's time for me to go"
13467280,13472320," it's time for me to go uh at some point well i'll have to integrate that into the game"
13472320,13482160," uh all right and we'll see how it will go all right so that was good stream thanks everyone who's"
13482160,13487440," watching right now i really appreciate it have a good one and you see all on the next recreation"
13487440,13496480," programming session with ahoo and mr azul it's a me i love you"
