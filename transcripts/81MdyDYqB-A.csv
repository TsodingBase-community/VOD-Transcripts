40,3560," Hello, everyone, and welcome to yet another recreational"
3560,5560," programming session with Amistad Sozin."
5560,11040," So recently I bought a new laptop because my old one is slowly"
11040,14280," dying because it's 10 years old laptop over 10 years old."
14280,17240," So I finally got it enough money."
17240,19560," Thank you everyone who donated to my wallet."
19560,21760," It's all the link in the description and stuff like that."
21760,24040," If you really want to support me, right."
24040,31640," And so I installed this time void Linux instead of Debian."
31640,34280," Don't ask me why."
34280,38080," Just to start, you know, Linux distribution work in the comment section."
38080,41640," That's that's literally why I decided to switch distra to just piece a lot of people."
41640,48280," So but the problem is that, right, my Emacs config, it doesn't work."
48280,48680," Right."
48680,52120," So I usually use Emacs because that's the only acceptable text editor."
53200,53600," Right."
53600,59160," And unfortunately, my config kind of grew rather complex as of late."
59160,59640," Right."
59640,61000," It grew kind of complex."
61000,64120," And on the new systems, it doesn't even work anymore."
64120,67680," Like I haven't updated Emacs for quite some time or anything."
67680,70360," So all of that is kind of already outdated."
70360,74520," So and I decided to maybe start from scratch."
74520,74880," Right."
74880,78760," So because I wasn't even using 90% of what I have in my config anyway."
78760,79200," Right."
79200,81720," So and I don't even need that much."
81720,88760," Honestly, I used to like in the past, I used to use a lot of different like extensions for Emacs."
88760,90560," My Emacs was basically an IDE."
90560,100720," And as I grew older and get more experienced as software developer, I actually started to realize that all of that is kind of like it just stays on your way."
100720,112200," So at the end of the day, what you want to have is a good compiler that reports errors well and reports them precisely and just a text editor that doesn't stay on your way."
112200,116200," And once you have these two things, you don't even need an IDE."
116200,116640," Right."
116640,121920," So because you can even refactor pretty complex code just by following compilation errors."
121920,122200," Right."
122200,129240," So if you master the art of compiler assisted refactoring, IDE is kind of a well, it's it's useful."
129240,130680," It makes you a little bit more efficient."
130680,133800," But this thing is more universal."
133800,134280," Right."
134280,145320," So this thing, this sort of, you know, idea of just using simple text editor and compiler errors will last you for decades because IDE is common goal."
145880,148280," They get created and they die."
148280,161960," So if you base your entire skills on this sort of like a, you know, intermediate things that die quickly, well, you will have to be in the in a state of constantly learning like these new tools and stuff like that."
161960,166920," You can just learn this one technique and it will serve you basically until the end of the days."
166920,167240," Right."
167240,168680," So it's rather convenient."
168680,169960," Honestly, it's rather convenient."
169960,170240," Right."
170240,174520," And it doesn't even matter that you'll be able to switch to a different text editor and the techniques are the same."
175160,176120," Right."
176120,181000," So anyway, I decided to start from scratch and also do that on the stream."
181000,182280," So here is the chat."
182280,183480," We're doing that live."
183480,184200," Say hello."
184200,185480," Say hello to YouTube people."
185480,186360," Right."
186360,189080," And YouTube people follow me on Twitch if you want to be in the chat in here."
189080,189480," Of course."
189480,189800," Of course."
189800,190120," Of course."
190120,191080," Of course."
191080,191720," So anyways."
191720,192840," Yeah."
192840,193960," So here's here's hello."
193960,194520," Here's cool."
194520,197080," It was actually kind of funny."
197080,199480," Just like say hello and just like put it off screen."
199480,203160," That's the ultimate troll, actually."
203160,204440," That's the ultimate troll, I think."
204440,206680," Anyways, so let's get started."
206680,210440," So when you actually start Emacs without any configuration, this is how it looks like."
210440,211880," It looks horrendous, honestly."
211880,214680," It looks absolutely horrendous."
214680,221080," But so to configure it, you have to create a file which is called .emacs."
221080,222040," Right."
222040,224600," So this is not the only file that you can use."
224600,231000," There is also a file that you can use that is within the Emacs .d."
231000,232200," I don't know how to spell it."
232200,232600," Right."
232600,233560," So there's another file."
233560,235960," I think it's something like .l."
236760,239640," You know, professional Emacs users, you can correct me on that."
239640,243160," But I personally just use, you know, Emacs .emacs."
243160,243400," Right."
243400,244920," Because it's kind of convenient."
244920,248760," So you can think of Emacs as just an Emacs Lisp interpreter."
248760,249800," Right."
249800,251080," So it's just an interpreter."
251080,254920," And the actual editor is just written."
254920,258600," It's just written in that Emacs Lisp."
258600,259560," Right."
259560,261800," It can also go to .config."
261800,262120," Okay."
262120,262920," Very well done."
262920,263480," It doesn't matter."
263480,266040," So there's several places where you can put this kind of stuff."
266040,272360," And the idea here is that when you start up Emacs, it takes that file and just evaluates it"
272360,277480," as an Emacs Lisp file, as an Emacs Lisp script."
277480,278840," So that's basically what it does."
278840,282280," And essentially what you can do, you can put all of your configuration in there"
282280,287720," and your configuration is going to be just basically Emacs Lisp code that gets executed on the start."
287720,290040," So that's basically what it is."
290040,291560," That's how simple you configure that."
291560,291880," Right."
291880,295000," I suppose it's the same with Vim and NeoVim and stuff like that."
295000,296120," Right."
296120,297720," So let's actually get started."
297720,301240," So first of all, I can kill this splash."
301240,302600," Splash is a separate buffer."
302600,303640," Right."
303640,305160," So and there is a scratch buffer."
305160,307880," And in a scratch buffer, you can basically put whatever."
307880,311320," So they even explain you like this buffer is for text that is not saved."
311320,315560," And for Lisp evaluation to create a file, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
315560,321240," So as you can see, the first offender of the of the look and feel of Emacs is"
321560,323000," the toolbar and menu bar."
323000,325560," What the fuck is that shit?"
325560,329560," Like, honestly, I personally don't even understand that."
329560,331240," Like, I personally don't even understand."
331240,336200," It's not like somebody non-technical is going to use that editor anyway."
337400,342040," Like you don't have to cater towards people who don't know how to use computers."
342040,343240," Right."
343240,345480," You can just like nuke all of this stuff right away."
345480,349640," It's just because the first thing people do when they start Emacs, they just remove all of that shit."
349640,353000," It's like for newbies, we have VS code."
353000,357000," Seriously, just like leave all of that shit to VS code."
357000,359400," Serious people don't need all that stuff."
359400,361960," Anyways, so the first thing we want to do."
361960,362280," Right."
362280,366040," So all of these things, they're basically modes of Emacs."
366040,369080," Emacs based on modes."
369080,369720," Right."
369720,371160," So and there's major mode."
371160,373480," And the major mode is the basically mode."
373480,374920," Like it's a major mode."
374920,376200," Right."
376200,380520," And there are minor modes, which are additional things to the major mode."
380520,384840," So as far as I know, these like toolbars and menu bars, they're minor modes."
384840,386040," And you can literally disable them."
386040,389400," So essentially, you can write some code like toolbar mode."
389400,393400," And if I'm not mistaken, to disable it, you just put -1 in here."
393400,393640," Right."
393640,394760," So this is a list, by the way."
394760,399080," So we're calling function toolbar mode with an argument -1."
399080,399320," Right."
399320,402120," And this is basically how s-expressions work."
402120,402280," Right."
402280,407080," So if you want to know more about s-expressions, I really recommend to actually Google them up."
407080,409560," So s-expressions."
409560,411640," Can I do that in English, please?"
412520,413960," Uh, can I do that in English?"
413960,420360," Wikipedia."
420360,423720," I swear to God."
423720,424520," Search engines."
424520,426280," I already said that in the pre-stream."
426280,429000," But you can actually see that search engines are fucking dead."
429000,431240," They're fucking dead."
431240,432120," Just use LLMs."
432120,434040," Don't Google that."
434040,436440," Just ask like your chat GPT or something."
436440,437880," That's just like, this is unusable."
437880,440680," This is so dumb."
440680,442280," Anyway, so let's actually open description."
442280,444200," I'm going to put that stuff in the description in here."
444200,445400," So this is s-expressions."
445400,445640," Right."
445640,449960," So if you want to program in Lisp, you kind of have to know how s-expressions work."
449960,450200," Right."
450200,454120," So if we evaluate, you evaluate this thing with the control X, control E."
454120,457720," And as you can see, the toolbar has been nuked."
457720,459480," It doesn't exist anymore."
459480,460840," So I don't know how to enable it."
460840,461800," I think you just do it like that."
461800,462040," Yeah."
462040,463080," So I can enable it."
463080,463960," Right."
463960,466920," So I'm going to put minus one in here and I just disable it."
466920,468600," So I also have this menu in here."
468600,470040," I also don't need that shit."
470040,476200," So what I'm going to do, I'm going to actually do menu bar mode minus one."
476200,477000," Right."
477000,478200," And I just like do it like that."
478200,486840," So what's interesting is that if you close your Emacs and open it again, it's not going to appear again."
486840,487160," Right."
487160,488120," It's not going to appear again."
488120,493240," So what we have to do, we have to put all of that code into dot Emacs."
493240,493640," Right."
493640,494600," So let's go ahead and do that."
494600,495960," So I'm going to open dot Emacs."
495960,504280," And I'm going to just literally put menu bar mode minus one and also toolbar mode minus one."
504280,505080," I'm going to close Emacs."
505080,509720," I'm going to open Emacs and there's no menu or toolbar mode."
509720,511160," So that's how we do that."
511160,513720," So that's how we configure Emacs."
513720,517160," So you just slowly pile some stuff in your dot Emacs."
517160,520840," And this is just the code that is that gets evaluated on startup."
520840,526760," But it's also the code that you can evaluate within Emacs itself because it's an interpreter."
526760,530840," It's like working within, you know, Python interpreter."
530840,533640," You can like evaluate some things right away."
533640,538920," But then at some point you can just put that stuff into like init script and it will just like,"
538920,541400," you know, evaluate it right away, like on the start."
542680,543560," So remove borders."
543560,545240," I don't usually like to remove borders."
545240,546520," So I think it's totally fine."
546520,549800," So one of the things I want to remove is this stupid splash screen."
549800,553960," So that's one thing I want to remove."
553960,555960," So I don't really remember how to remove the splash screen."
555960,558520," So I think I'm going to use my dot files config."
558520,558760," Right."
558760,561960," So I put all my configuration, public configuration in dot files."
561960,565560," I have no idea why people submit me pull requests to my personal config."
565560,567960," Like what the fuck is wrong with you?"
567960,568920," Why the fuck you do that?"
568920,570120," It's my personal config."
570120,572680," It's not supposed to work anywhere except on my machine."
572680,576360," If something doesn't work for you, well, clone it, fork it and fix it yourself."
576360,577880," Like why do you submit people requests?"
577880,585000," It's like, honestly, I just don't understand that mindset."
585000,586280," Like, I just don't understand it."
586280,591480," So this repo is just for your personal information as a reference."
591480,591800," Right."
591800,594200," So you're interested how I did a certain thing."
594200,595720," This is how I did a certain thing."
595720,595960," Right."
595960,597960," So it doesn't have to be usable for everybody."
597960,598840," It's my repo."
598840,599320," It's for me."
600200,606440," So sometimes I put even some things that don't make any sense on other computers except mine."
606440,609160," It's just like, it doesn't make any fucking sense except my computer."
609160,613320," Because for instance, I have a computer with a specific name in the network."
613320,616360," And I just put that name, hard code that name right in there."
616360,618280," Like, you don't have that name in your network."
618280,619560," Like, why the fuck would you do that?"
619560,622680," Well, I don't submit passwords and stuff like that."
622680,624120," People talking about passwords."
624120,624760," Seven issues."
624760,627480," Okay."
627480,632120," It was funny that I can disable issues, but I can't disable pull requests."
632120,633560," Right."
633560,634920," I can't disable pull requests."
634920,635880," 800 commits."
635880,636200," Yeah."
636200,638520," I've been doing this kind of shit for quite some time."
638520,640440," Some of the changes are eight years old."
640440,642520," Look at that."
642520,643480," It's eight years old."
645320,648600," The zooming on XFC is actually kind of sucky wacky."
648600,650120," So I'll probably have to build Boomer."
650120,651720," Uh, right."
651720,655080," Maybe I should, I could build Boomer, uh, right away."
655080,656440," So on the string."
656440,659080," Ah, it's written in NIMH."
659080,659560," Fuck."
659560,665320," Now I need to like download NIMH and stuff like that."
665320,665720," Just like."
665720,671000," I think I should just rewrite this shit in C already."
671000,674440," Just rewrite this shit in C."
675880,678120," Just rewrite this shit in C."
678120,680200," Just rewrite this shit in C."
680200,684040," Just rewrite this shit in C."
684040,686040," And eventually you'll see."
686040,688600," Just rewrite this shit in C."
688600,690600," Just rewrite this shit in C."
690600,692040," Just rewrite this shit in C."
692040,694440," Just rewrite this shit in C."
694440,696760," Rust is just a fallacy."
696760,698040," All right."
698040,699480," So I think I'm going to do."
699480,700760," Maybe we should do that in the stream."
700760,707480," But honestly, rewriting things from one language to another one is not particularly interesting content."
707480,709160," Because it's kind of a mechanical one."
709160,709400," Right?"
709400,715160," So you just go through the lines of code and translate them to, uh, to translate to, to a different language."
715160,716680," So I don't freaking know."
716680,716840," Yeah."
716840,718040," Maybe I'm going to do that off screen."
718040,719640," We'll see."
719640,720520," We'll see."
720520,721960," Eventually we'll see."
721960,723160," How do I disable this splash?"
723160,725880," So I have a bunch of code in here."
725880,727640," Um, so something about splash."
727640,728360," I do remember that."
728360,728920," Oh, look at that."
729480,731640," I even disabled in the original code."
731640,733400," I even disabled like a scroll bar."
733400,735000," Uh huh."
735000,737160," So there's a toolbar at here."
737160,737880," I use zero."
737880,741560," Honestly, I don't can remember like what kind of arguments you put in there."
741560,744520," Sometimes you put minus one, sometimes you put zero."
744520,746680," And I don't know what's the difference."
746680,750840," The cool thing about Emacs is that it's self-explorable."
750840,753000," Actually, it's self-explorable."
753000,757560," You press control H F and it asks you to describe a function."
757560,761640," You can literally put a function in here like toolbar mode."
761640,763720," And it gives you documentation for this thing."
763720,765560," Like you can just read it right away."
765560,766200," Right?"
766200,768360," So, and let's actually see about arg."
768360,772840," If code from Lisp toggle the mode arg is toggle."
772840,775320," Enable the mode if arg is nil."
775320,778280," Amit or is positive number."
778280,779800," Aha."
779800,781880," Enable mode if arg is nil."
781880,784840," Amit it or is a positive number."
784840,787400," So that's why it was disabled when it was negative."
788040,791240," Disable the mode when arg is a negative number."
791240,792200," Aha."
792200,794040," Very interesting."
794040,794440," Okay."
794440,795400," So it's kind of weird."
795400,796920," But I mean, it is what it is."
796920,799560," So I also disabled toolbar, menu bar, scroll bar."
799560,801400," And I enabled colon number mode."
801400,801560," Right?"
801560,802840," So I can have numbers."
802840,805560," And I also set show parent mode."
805560,807080," So it doesn't show parents."
807080,807400," Yeah."
807400,808840," But if all it does show parents."
808840,812680," I think this kind of option is already sort of obsolete."
812680,814600," But one of the things I probably want to do."
814600,817160," Is just like add these two things to my Emacs."
817160,819240," That's for sure."
819240,822520," And I suppose here I'm going to just put zero."
822520,822680," Right?"
822680,824520," So I disabled the scroll bar."
824520,826360," So that removed the scroll bar."
826360,831000," And I'm going to add the column mode."
831000,832440," Column number mode."
832440,835880," It didn't enable shit, brother."
835880,837000," Yeah."
837000,838920," Is that a thing that still exists in Emacs?"
840040,840280," Right."
840280,841720," Column number mode is interactive."
841720,842760," Native compiled."
842760,844600," Right."
844600,845640," It's not seems to be."
845640,850360," So I don't really know why it doesn't work."
850360,851800," Maybe I need to restart Emacs."
851800,853400," So let's actually try to restart Emacs."
853400,855640," No."
855640,856440," There's no numbers."
856440,858760," Number."
858760,862360," Maybe it's not a thing anymore."
862360,862760," Okay."
862760,863160," Whatever."
863160,864680," Okay."
864680,866520," So here is a cool thing."
866520,869800," So we need to bring in that Gruber darker thingy."
870680,874600," And Gruber darker thingy is located in a separate sort of repo."
874600,877000," So Emacs has its own package manager."
877000,877240," Right?"
877240,879320," So Emacs has its own package manager."
879320,881480," So you can access it by doing list packages."
881480,881720," Right?"
881720,882920," So here's the list packages."
882920,887320," And if you try to find Gruber darker in there."
887320,890440," Non-Gnu."
890440,893000," It's available in non-Gnu part."
893000,895560," Oh."
897320,901480," So do we have any professional Emacs users?"
901480,905320," What is the current status of Malpa?"
905320,909480," So Malpa was a thing a long time ago."
909480,911560," At least at the time when I was using Emacs."
911560,913880," Like very actively was configuring and stuff like that."
913880,915160," Right."
915160,917240," It's sort of like a third-party repo."
917240,918440," Right."
918440,921560," Malpa is still used."
921560,921800," Okay."
921800,922760," Malpa is still used."
922760,925480," But what about this non-Gnu thing?"
925480,927560," What's up with this non-Gnu?"
927560,929160," What is non-Gnu?"
929160,933640," So Gnu I suppose is an official archive."
933640,934760," And there's a non-Gnu."
934760,937560," Is it Malpa?"
938280,941160," It is an official repo with less strict rules."
941160,942120," Ha."
942120,947480," And Gruber darker got into official Emacs repo."
947480,950200," With just less strict rules."
950200,951160," And this is my..."
951160,952920," I don't remember submitting that thing."
952920,954920," But it actually refers to my repo."
954920,955240," Right."
955240,958440," So if you ever wanted to use the same mode as I use in Emacs."
958440,960040," You can actually just use it in here."
960040,962280," Right."
962280,964040," So that's bizarre."
964040,965000," That's interesting."
965000,968920," Because I remember submitting manually to Malpa this thing."
968920,975240," But apparently it became popular enough that it got into official thing."
975240,976120," Right."
976120,978120," Well, I mean, it has like quite a few stars."
978120,979800," And I didn't even start it."
979800,980520," Give it a star."
980520,983000," Let's bring it to 200 stars."
983000,983640," How about that?"
983640,987480," Your theme made it into Alpa service?"
987480,987960," Probably."
988840,991720," So emacs non-gnu repo."
991720,994440," Maybe it should be called archive."
994440,997880," Non-gnu emacs list package archive."
997880,1000680," So non-gnu emacs list package archive."
1000680,1007320," So packages are maintained through browse packages."
1007320,1009960," And I can just do Gruber."
1009960,1011080," All right."
1011080,1014840," So color theme for emacs 24."
1014840,1016120," Here's an interesting thing."
1017240,1021000," So this is actually kind of a very specific description."
1021000,1024840," And you know why it's so specific?"
1024840,1026120," Why emacs 24?"
1026120,1033400," Even though the current version, the current version of emacs 29, but I said 24."
1033400,1042600," So this is because for quite some time emacs didn't have an official mechanism for color themes."
1044200,1046760," It didn't have an official mechanism for color themes."
1046760,1055240," Before, what you're supposed to do is to manually edit different faces with colors in your dot emacs."
1055240,1057480," The way Jonathan Blow does that."
1057480,1058600," Right."
1058600,1060360," You know how Jonathan Blow does that?"
1060360,1068520," He just like manually edits, you know, specific things in his config without using any of the mechanisms."
1068520,1070680," Because he's a very old emacs user."
1070680,1072280," Very old emacs users."
1072280,1074600," And this is how it used to be in emacs."
1074600,1081960," And people disabled color theme mechanisms as separate packages, right?"
1081960,1086840," You would install separate package and then you would develop a theme for that specific package."
1087640,1089640," And I really liked Gruber Darker theme."
1089640,1095160," But then at some point emacs 24 got an official mechanism for color themes."
1095160,1104520," And themes created for that official mechanism were not compatible with themes from the third party one."
1104520,1106520," So you had to manually migrate."
1106520,1110520," You had to manually migrate the themes to the new mechanism."
1110520,1115880," And since I used this theme back in the days, I just took upon it myself to migrate it."
1115880,1119400," And this is why I said because the mechanism appeared in emacs 24."
1119400,1120840," Right."
1120840,1122920," So that's why it's that specific description."
1122920,1124760," So I just wanted to share that trivia for you."
1124760,1125640," Right."
1125640,1127560," So why is it this specific description?"
1127560,1131560," Because it's for the mechanism that appeared in emacs 24."
1131560,1133800," Before that, we didn't have that mechanism."
1133800,1134920," Right."
1134920,1138680," It's kind of funny how at the time it kind of seemed obvious."
1138680,1140840," You didn't have to explain that description."
1140840,1146360," But as the time goes on, this intrinsic knowledge kind of gets lost."
1146360,1148760," So some things don't make any sense."
1148760,1151240," And I wonder, it's kind of funny."
1151240,1155640," It's about, it happens with everything, actually."
1155640,1156840," It happens with everything."
1156840,1162840," If you take older, like older books or older letters and stuff like that,"
1162840,1166840," and you will try to read them, it don't make any sense to you."
1167400,1170760," Even not because you lack the context of why it was written."
1170760,1175240," But I mean, you technically like the context, but because like a lot of intrinsic knowledge"
1175240,1178040," that existed at the time, it doesn't exist anymore."
1178040,1180040," So it just doesn't make any sense to you."
1180040,1183160," It's kind of funny how that happens, isn't it?"
1183160,1190920," And people who work with these old documents, they probably spend a lot of time sort of recovering"
1190920,1196440," all of that intrinsic knowledge that got lost through other documents that they find at the time."
1196440,1197400," Right."
1197400,1202600," So, and then through that additional context, they can understand what the fuck is going on."
1202600,1204680," Right."
1204680,1208680," Like books from, you know, 19th century casualty referencing Roman history and Latin."
1208680,1209080," Exactly."
1211720,1213880," Um, so yeah, it's kind of interesting."
1213880,1215480," It's kind of interesting how that happens."
1215480,1219000," I will just like knowledge, like naturally gets lost."
1219000,1221080," It just naturally gets lost."
1221080,1221800," We got some subs."
1221800,1223720," I wasn't acknowledging them for quite some time."
1223720,1225480," Thank you so much, Artificial Fly."
1225480,1226120," Thank you so much."
1226120,1227160," Enumerate with the message."
1227160,1228760," What's up, Mr. Azuzin."
1228760,1232200," I'm about to have a coffee and pool and all nighter."
1232200,1234360," Might do some recreation programming afterwards."
1234360,1234760," Nice."
1234760,1236200," And I'm going to just keep programming."
1236200,1237320," I'm just going to keep programming."
1237320,1238040," Enjoy your coffee."
1238040,1239240," Uh, thank you."
1239240,1240440," Thank you so much for, for the beats."
1240440,1243560," The beats."
1243560,1245400," Anyways."
1245400,1254360," So, uh, yeah, essentially, uh, we can just install gruba daca, gruba daca, uh, list packages, uh,"
1254360,1255320," gruba daca."
1255320,1257480," So, uh, gruba daca."
1257480,1260600," So I, uh, I basically put my cursor on gruba daca."
1260600,1264440," I press I, it's marked as needs to be installed."
1264440,1267720," And I press X and it will be installed automatically."
1267720,1268840," Right."
1268840,1269160," Okay."
1269160,1270520," So it seems to be installed."
1270520,1276680," So afterwards, uh, I probably need to do, uh, customize, uh, vim, vims."
1276680,1278920," And the gruba daca should be already here."
1278920,1279160," Okay."
1279160,1280520," So it's, it's already here."
1280520,1282360," I can just enable it."
1282360,1283640," Here's an interesting thing."
1283640,1288280," Uh, so it says loading a vim can run Lisp code."
1288280,1289080," Really load it."
1289080,1290360," Right."
1290360,1295240," So it has some sort of a mechanism for, uh, you know, for safety."
1295240,1295400," Right."
1295400,1299320," It doesn't allow you to run like some arbitrary code right away."
1299320,1301960," It first asks you whether you want to load it or not."
1301960,1303240," So you press yes."
1303240,1308200," And then it also asks you treat this theme as safe in future sessions."
1308760,1310600," And I also answer yes."
1310600,1310760," Right."
1310760,1313640," So, and finally we have dark mode."
1313640,1315240," Look at that."
1315240,1315800," Look at that."
1315800,1317000," Shisey minor friend."
1317000,1319640," Uh, so can I have a scratch?"
1319640,1320120," There we go."
1320120,1324440," Finally, this looks like a Zoysin text editor."
1326840,1328600," Oh, it feels so fucking nice."
1328600,1329320," Holy shit."
1329320,1331640," All right."
1331640,1333480," Uh, looks familiar."
1333480,1334040," Exactly."
1334040,1335720," So I can define some things."
1335720,1335960," Right."
1335960,1336840," So hello."
1336840,1339480," And, uh, maybe here I have to put this kind of thing."
1339480,1340520," Uh, right."
1340520,1341160," So message."
1341160,1343560," Uh, hello world."
1343560,1345960," Finally, this is a proper Zoysin stream."
1345960,1348600," Uh, I define this thing and I can do hello."
1348600,1349960," Uh, right."
1349960,1351640," And it's just that."
1351640,1355880," Uh, you can't see that, but I mean, maybe, maybe we can just return."
1355880,1357880," Hello world from the function."
1357880,1358840," Who said we can't do that?"
1358840,1359560," We can't do that."
1359560,1361320," And I'm going to evaluate that."
1361320,1361880," And boom."
1361880,1363400," Uh, yeah."
1363400,1366360," I can't."
1366360,1369640," I forgot how to use Emacs leave."
1369640,1370120," So I'm sorry."
1370120,1375960," I remember there was a way to evaluate this thing and then insert the result of the evaluation."
1375960,1376520," Control J."
1376520,1377160," Ah, control J."
1377160,1377480," Thank you."
1377480,1377960," Thank you so much."
1377960,1379080," That's what I want."
1379080,1379240," Yeah."
1379240,1380040," There we go."
1380040,1382680," So you can just like press control J."
1382680,1382920," Right."
1382920,1385240," That evaluates it and also inserts the result."
1385880,1388680," of evaluation in like, in the next line."
1388680,1389800," And that's how you do that."
1389800,1391800," So you can just use it as a calculator."
1391800,1395160," 34, 35 and boom 69."
1395160,1396120," So that's how it works."
1396120,1399160," Uh, right."
1399160,1400600," That is epic."
1400600,1401640," Mighty friendly."
1401640,1402920," That is epic."
1402920,1405320," So, uh, the next thing we need to do."
1405320,1409720," What's funny is that once you use this automatic customizable things, right?"
1409720,1414280," Once you use them, uh, they actually modify your Emacs config, right?"
1414280,1419560," So this is the things that we edit manually, and this is what Emacs edit automatically."
1419560,1426280," So the like Emacs has this very nasty habit of just fucking edited your editing your config."
1428200,1430600," It just edits your fucking config because fuck you."
1430600,1432840," Which makes me think."
1432840,1436920," Maybe I should actually put my code in a different place."
1436920,1438680," Right."
1438680,1441560," By the way, is that the reason why people put their code in a different place?"
1441560,1445800," Not in dot Emacs because Emacs always tries to modify dot Emacs."
1445800,1447160," Right."
1447160,1448760," Is that the actual reason?"
1448760,1451640," So, because they don't want their config to be modified or whatever."
1451640,1454120," Uh, just set a custom file."
1454120,1454920," Okay."
1454920,1456600," So what is a custom file though?"
1456600,1458680," Uh, custom."
1458680,1459720," Is that a function?"
1459720,1461320," Uh, okay."
1461320,1462520," So it's a custom file."
1462520,1463320," It's a, it's a function."
1463320,1464600," Uh, okay."
1464600,1467720," So it's a function that returns the file name for saving customization."
1467720,1467960," Okay."
1467960,1468680," That's actually pretty cool."
1468680,1469160," I didn't know that."
1469160,1469480," Thank you."
1470040,1471400," So a custom file."
1471400,1471640," Right."
1471640,1473080," So I can do it like that."
1473080,1474600," Uh, right."
1474600,1476440," And it didn't return shit for me."
1476440,1478680," Maybe this is because I have to go to the scratch."
1478680,1480120," Uh, yeah."
1480120,1481880," So this is where it is."
1481880,1482200," Okay."
1482200,1484200," So I can just actually create a separate file for them."
1484200,1485640," Uh, okay."
1485640,1487480," How can I customize it though?"
1487480,1489080," Because this thing just returns it."
1489080,1490600," Uh, uh huh."
1490600,1492360," So."
1492360,1494520," Yeah."
1494520,1497080," File custom file."
1497080,1498200," So here is that."
1500040,1502760," Uh, so custom file."
1502760,1503400," Custom file."
1503400,1505080," Maybe set custom file."
1505080,1505640," No."
1505640,1511160," So let's try a custom file."
1511160,1515720," Set queue custom file."
1515720,1517800," So, but the custom file is a function."
1517800,1519320," So that means there is a variable."
1519320,1521480," Uh, custom file."
1521480,1521960," Oh yeah."
1521960,1522280," Okay."
1522280,1523320," So there is a variable."
1523320,1524040," Custom file."
1524040,1524840," Okay."
1524840,1532600," So there is a function and variable with literally the same name."
1532600,1534840," With literally the same name."
1535800,1540920," So, and it works because I think Emacs Lisp is a Lisp 2."
1540920,1541160," Yeah."
1541160,1542680," People know."
1542680,1543320," People know."
1543320,1545560," We have so many people who actually understand stuff."
1545560,1545800," Okay."
1545800,1547240," That's actually super cool."
1547240,1551560," So there in Lisps, uh, there is a concept of Lisp 1 and Lisp 2."
1551560,1555160," And 1 and 2 refers to the amount of namespaces."
1555160,1556200," Right."
1556200,1562280," So Lisp 1 means that there is a shared one single namespace for variables and functions."
1562280,1566520," Lisp 2 means that there are separate namespaces for variables and functions."
1566520,1566760," Right."
1566760,1570920," So Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp, all of these sort of like Python-ish Lisps,"
1570920,1573000," which are not really functional programming languages."
1573000,1575160," They are more like imperative programming languages."
1575160,1575960," They are Lisp 2s."
1575960,1577160," Uh, right."
1577160,1581480," So, and they distinguish whether something is a variable or a function depending on the context."
1581480,1581880," Right."
1581880,1585720," So, because you can only use a function name in a very specific context."
1585720,1589480," You can use them as a first element of the list."
1589480,1589720," Right."
1589720,1591160," Because this is the function call."
1591160,1592520," Right."
1592520,1594200," You can't put a variable in here."
1594200,1594440," Right."
1594440,1596520," So you have to put a function in here."
1596520,1596760," Right."
1596760,1601560," And if f appears in any different place, it is recognized as a variable."
1601560,1602840," Right."
1602840,1608440," So it's kind of relatively easy on the interpreter level to distinguish functions and variables."
1608440,1610120," That's why it's two separate namespaces."
1610120,1610440," Right."
1610440,1615560," So it's just like you don't have to look up in both spaces depending on the context."
1615560,1618200," You know in which namespace you have to look into that stuff."
1618200,1621880," Honestly, I think this single namespace is better."
1621880,1622600," Yeah, I also think so."
1622600,1627000," But I mean Lisp, Emacs Lisp and Common Lisp are very old languages."
1627000,1632120," People at the time didn't really know that much about language ergonomics."
1632120,1638920," So if you look at all the languages, you may notice that they're not very convenient."
1638920,1642280," They're kind of clunky and it's just like kind of weird and stuff like that."
1642280,1647560," And I think this is due to people just not knowing what an ergonomic language looks like."
1647560,1647800," Right."
1647800,1652360," So because we as a humanity didn't have that much experience in programming in the past,"
1652360,1654840," now we have way more experience in programming."
1654840,1658840," Now we know what kind of things we actually want, what kind of things are actually convenient."
1658840,1661720," Do you use vMotions, Emacs?"
1661720,1664360," No, I'm using Emacs native things."
1668440,1668920," So yeah."
1668920,1672840," So that's basically the thing."
1672840,1677800," And I suppose maybe I'm going to actually do a set queue custom file."
1677800,1683480," And I'm going to call it maybe something like Emacs custom."
1683480,1683720," Right."
1683720,1688120," Because I just don't want this thing to modify my main config."
1688120,1689880," So I'm going to go somewhere here."
1689880,1692280," I'm going to say, okay, so put that into here."
1692280,1695000," And I'm going to go into that file Emacs custom."
1695000,1697640," And I'm going to probably copy paste this entire thing in here."
1698440,1699080," And there we go."
1699080,1700680," So this is your custom file."
1700680,1703400," Don't fucking touch my dot Emacs, please."
1703400,1706200," Please do not fucking touch that, mate."
1706200,1708360," Do not fucking touch that."
1708360,1710920," And by the way, the comments are semicolons, right?"
1710920,1714920," So I don't know what this column mode does and why it doesn't fucking work."
1714920,1716280," Right."
1716280,1719400," So I remember there was something like a global column."
1719400,1721720," Global number mode."
1721720,1724040," Maybe linum mode."
1726680,1728680," Global display line numbers mode."
1728680,1729080," Yeah."
1729080,1729880," This is what it is."
1729880,1730360," There you go."
1730360,1730840," Look at that."
1730840,1731960," Display."
1731960,1732840," This is what we want."
1732840,1736680," Display global numbers."
1736680,1739240," Numbers mode."
1739240,1739480," Right."
1739480,1741960," So I can probably disable it like this."
1745400,1746280," Was it global?"
1746280,1753320," I think I almost figured it out."
1753320,1757000," Line numbers."
1757000,1758440," Yeah."
1758440,1759800," And then I can enable it."
1759800,1760840," There we go."
1760840,1762200," So that's pretty convenient."
1762200,1763240," So we don't need that one."
1763240,1765080," We only need this one."
1765080,1765880," So that's pretty cool."
1766840,1768440," So damn."
1768440,1769400," Look at that."
1769400,1774200," So what's funny is that this is pretty much everything I need these days, I suppose."
1774200,1777000," I probably need Edo mode."
1777000,1779480," Do you guys know what is the Edo mode?"
1779480,1781640," Do you guys know what is the Edo mode?"
1781640,1789240," So at the bottom, I had this very cool thing where I just type and it automatically searches and actually ranks this stuff."
1789880,1790120," Right."
1790120,1792520," But you don't have that by default anymore."
1792520,1794520," You have to actually explicitly enable it."
1794520,1796440," And it's not even a third-party package."
1796440,1797640," It comes with Emacs."
1797640,1799640," It's just disabled because fuck you."
1799640,1801320," We don't want Emacs to be popular."
1801320,1803080," We don't want Emacs to be convenient."
1803080,1804040," Yeah."
1804040,1805320," We also need to do relative numbers."
1805320,1807080," I don't remember how to do relative numbers."
1807080,1810280," Like Edo is so universally fucking useful."
1810280,1813000," I have no idea why it is not just enabled by default."
1813000,1813880," So Edo mode."
1813880,1815000," Right."
1815000,1817000," So, but it's kind of difficult to see."
1817000,1819880," So first, I want to actually increase the size of the default font."
1819880,1821800," So we're going to get to that a little bit later."
1821800,1825320," So I think it's kind of weird."
1825320,1828920," Look, I feel like I get to receive the things."
1828920,1829960," Okay."
1829960,1831640," So something weird with my log."
1831640,1835560," Anyways, so let's go."
1835560,1838040," What I wanted to do."
1838040,1841400," What I wanted to do."
1841400,1843080," I wanted to increase the size."
1843080,1843320," Yeah."
1843320,1844040," Relative numbers."
1844040,1845240," Relative numbers."
1845240,1846280," Relative numbers."
1847560,1849800," So displaying line number type."
1849800,1852840," And it's a customizable variable."
1852840,1853800," So here's the thing."
1853800,1858040," In Emacs, there are global variables."
1858040,1858440," Right."
1858440,1863080," And you can set them with just set queue like you do in any list and stuff like that."
1863080,1865400," But you can actually customize them."
1865400,1865640," Right."
1865640,1868360," So you can say customize variable."
1868360,1869160," Right."
1869160,1872840," And you can put the name of the variable like displaying line number type."
1872840,1876600," And it gives you UI through which you can customize this thing."
1876600,1877960," Right."
1877960,1879880," So and what we can do in here."
1879880,1883080," So the default type of the line numbers is to display line numbers mode."
1883880,1884200," Okay."
1884200,1885800," So can I just press that one?"
1885800,1889160," Yeah."
1889160,1889800," So group."
1889800,1891560," I don't see it."
1891560,1892120," Where is it?"
1892120,1893720," Okay."
1893720,1894200," So yeah."
1894200,1897800," Very convenient UI, by the way."
1897800,1898920," So value menu."
1898920,1899160," Right."
1899160,1905640," So in the value menu, you can do relative line numbers, relative visual line numbers, absolute line numbers."
1905640,1905800," Okay."
1905800,1907800," So we're going to put zero in here."
1907800,1910120," And then I save this entire thing."
1910120,1913080," And it didn't do shit, honestly."
1913080,1914840," It didn't do shit."
1914840,1915160," And it."
1915160,1918200," Okay."
1918200,1923000," It saved this thing again because the customize file is not modified."
1923000,1923400," I see."
1924600,1924840," Yeah."
1924840,1925080," Yeah."
1925080,1926840," So I probably have to set this thing."
1926840,1928200," Right."
1928200,1930920," And let me put that stuff emacs customer."
1930920,1933960," So I forgot to update this entire thing."
1933960,1937880," So please forgive me."
1937880,1940520," I don't see any modification in here."
1940520,1941400," That's kind of weird."
1941400,1945080," So can I customize a customized variable one more time?"
1945080,1947160," So the name of the variable is this thing."
1947160,1949320," Customize line numbers."
1949320,1950680," And in."
1950680,1955000," Set it with relative arguments."
1955000,1956120," Okay."
1956120,1959160," Relative visual lines."
1959160,1961400," So maybe I have to put one in here."
1961400,1965000," I have a feeling that it doesn't automatically."
1965000,1967880," Yeah."
1967880,1970520," I think it doesn't automatically reevaluate that stuff."
1970520,1970920," Right."
1970920,1972440," So relative."
1973160,1975000," So maybe if I do something like that."
1975000,1977000," Oh, finally it works."
1977000,1978520," Okay."
1978520,1979640," So if I do visual."
1979640,1982200," Or."
1982200,1986280," If I remove it at all."
1986280,1989000," It doesn't change anything."
1989000,1989160," Okay."
1989160,1990600," So it's a relative."
1990600,1990840," All right."
1990840,1991960," So let's keep it in here."
1991960,1995160," Another thing I would like to do, honestly, is just to put L in here."
1995160,1995560," Right."
1995560,1999800," So when I open this entire thing like emacs custom."
1999800,2001560," Right."
2001560,2003000," I can do something like that."
2003000,2005240," So we don't need any of that stuff anymore."
2005240,2005560," Right."
2005560,2008920," So emacs custom dot L."
2008920,2009160," Right."
2009160,2011480," And it automatically enables highlighting and stuff like that."
2011480,2011640," Okay."
2011640,2012040," That's cool."
2012040,2013400," That is cool."
2013400,2013960," That is cool."
2013960,2018040," I set up my VM just copying the config file."
2018040,2019000," Fair, fair, fair."
2019000,2023080," But I like to use actually Simlinks for this kind of stuff."
2023080,2025560," And I don't even use Stow, by the way."
2025560,2026680," I don't even use Stow."
2026680,2031320," So thank you so much, Cordain Cords, for the message."
2031320,2036920," All these past experiences in creating very bizarre languages had evolved into modern style of languages."
2036920,2041000," But for some reason, there is also Rust."
2041000,2045560," Well, I mean, Rust tries to think about ergonomics, but not too much."
2045560,2049800," Because safety is more important than your ergonomics."
2049800,2050600," Right."
2050600,2052840," Safety above all."
2052840,2054120," Safety above all."
2054120,2058600," If safety means that the programmer has to suffer, so be it."
2058600,2061720," Suffer safety."
2061720,2063160," Think about the children."
2063160,2065560," That's basically Rust."
2066360,2066920," Seriously."
2066920,2068600," That's basically Rust."
2068600,2069560," Safety above all."
2069560,2069800," Right."
2069800,2075320," So if that means you have to suffer, if that means you have to hate your life, so be it."
2075320,2076280," So be fucking it."
2076280,2078520," Think about the children."
2078520,2079480," This is a moral."
2079480,2081720," This is not even technical issue."
2081720,2083640," This is a fucking moral issue."
2083640,2091160," So the actual innovation Rust did, the actual innovation Rust did, they turned using a specific language,"
2091160,2094440," not in a technical issue, but into a fucking moral issue."
2094440,2097560," That's the hugest innovation in the marketing of programming languages."
2097560,2098760," Nobody's done that before."
2098760,2102920," They opened a whole can of worms with this one, honestly."
2102920,2105480," They opened a whole can of worms, I'm telling you."
2115320,2117880," It's a moral weapon languages become something more than a tool."
2117880,2118360," Exactly."
2118360,2118760," Exactly."
2118760,2120200," It's literally a moral issue."
2120200,2126680," They're using moral issues as a ways to promote language and shove it everywhere."
2127400,2128760," Because it's not technical."
2128760,2130600," It's not technical."
2130600,2133960," You are being unethical for not accepting this language."
2133960,2134840," You are the problem."
2134840,2136360," It's not the language that is the problem."
2136360,2138120," That is absolutely shady and unorganized."
2138120,2138680," It's you are."
2138680,2140280," You are."
2140280,2141640," You're being absolutely unethical."
2141640,2142360," You are the problem."
2142360,2143320," We need to get rid of you."
2143320,2144360," Right."
2145400,2147880," So because they're higher purpose, there's higher goal."
2147880,2148920," Safety."
2148920,2150440," Safety."
2150440,2152680," Right."
2152680,2154120," That's the biggest innovation of ours."
2154120,2155160," Not borrow checker."
2155160,2157880," Actual this."
2157880,2162120," So anyways, I think we need to set the phone somehow,"
2162120,2163240," because I kind of hate this one."
2163240,2163960," This kind of man."
2165320,2165880," Right."
2165880,2167480," So let me see."
2167480,2169160," So how do we do that?"
2169160,2173960," So the way I do that, by the way,"
2173960,2178200," I actually set different fonts depending on Windows and Linux."
2178200,2181880," You can actually see that this config is very old,"
2181880,2185560," because it assumes that I'm going to be using Windows sometimes."
2185560,2189720," Anyway."
2189720,2191960," So, I mean, it's been quite some time."
2191960,2194440," I don't fucking use Windows anymore."
2194440,2195800," So this is what I was talking about,"
2195800,2197960," that it has a lot of things that, like,"
2197960,2200360," it just don't make any sense in my current setup."
2200360,2201880," Like, it's a very old config."
2201880,2205400," And some people say that it's like 10 years old or something."
2205400,2207480," I've been on GitHub for..."
2207480,2210840," I didn't even know for how long I've been on GitHub, honestly."
2210840,2212280," So let me actually see."
2212280,2214200," You can't even see that."
2214200,2219320," But I created GitHub in 2000."
2219320,2221640," You can't see that because this is not Boomer."
2221640,2222520," I really need Boomer."
2223800,2224920," So let me actually bring it."
2224920,2227240," So it's actually 2009."
2227240,2228360," Yeah, it's 2009."
2228360,2230520," This is when I created the GitHub account."
2230520,2234760," As far as I know, GitHub was created in 2008."
2234760,2235640," Right."
2235640,2237880," So I created GitHub account like one year after that."
2237880,2241320," And I've not been doing much for a couple of years."
2241320,2242040," Yeah."
2242040,2244360," So in 2011, I started to do some things."
2244360,2248680," And 2012, this is where it picked up and I started doing things."
2248680,2248920," Right."
2248920,2253720," In 2013, I just like ramped up and I've been doing stuff."
2253720,2255400," I've been doing stuff since then."
2255560,2259240," For many, many years, actually."
2259240,2260360," For many, many years."
2260360,2263160," In 2013, I think I graduated the uni, right?"
2263160,2267640," And actually started to do my first job and stuff like that."
2269240,2269960," Right."
2269960,2271960," So yeah, still using it."
2271960,2275160," Still, still using it."
2275160,2276040," Holy shit."
2276040,2276920," What the fuck?"
2276920,2278920," Why do I have so many followers?"
2278920,2279560," What the fuck?"
2279560,2282600," Jesus."
2285800,2286520," I didn't know that."
2286520,2289800," Like I don't even use GitHub that much anymore."
2289800,2294840," The only way I interact with GitHub is by doing git pull, git push."
2294840,2296760," I don't even do git pull."
2296760,2297560," I just do git fetch."
2297560,2298360," But anyway."
2298360,2299640," Right."
2299640,2302200," So it's just like I don't use this UI very much."
2302200,2304120," Just a little bit."
2304120,2306840," So it's just like, you know, fetch and push there."
2306840,2309240," So we're all stalking you."
2309240,2309640," Thank you."
2309640,2312760," Oh, yeah."
2312760,2314120," Very interesting."
2314120,2316920," So this is a very old config."
2316920,2319560," It assumes that I'm going to be using Windows."
2319560,2324040," So and I just have this function that checks on which system I am."
2324040,2325480," Right."
2325480,2326760," And then where do we use this function?"
2326760,2327000," Okay."
2327000,2331640," So add to list default frame a list."
2331640,2333400," This one is rather interesting, honestly."
2333400,2337400," So because you're adding this stuff to a list."
2337400,2339240," Right."
2339240,2344200," And essentially you just add a bunch of fonts here."
2344200,2348120," So I wonder what that means."
2348120,2350760," Let's actually read documentation for this for this list."
2350760,2352280," Right."
2352280,2356040," So a list is of default values for frame parameters."
2356040,2356280," Okay."
2356280,2357320," So here's an interesting thing."
2357320,2360280," Like, do you know the terminology of Emacs?"
2360280,2366360," Window in Emacs is called this section."
2366360,2366680," Right."
2366680,2371880," So for instance, I split my, you know, my Emacs into two windows."
2371880,2374440," And now, for example, I have three."
2374440,2377000," So this is Emacs with three windows."
2377000,2382360," Frame is an actual operating system window."
2382360,2385000," So this thing is a frame."
2385000,2389480," You can actually create new frame or something like, or maybe frame."
2389480,2390920," I don't remember."
2390920,2394040," New frame."
2394040,2395320," How do you create a new frame?"
2395320,2396040," A make frame."
2396040,2396840," Thank you so much."
2396840,2397400," Make frame."
2397400,2399080," You can actually create a second window."
2399080,2400360," And this is second frame."
2400360,2402600," And these are part of the same process."
2403480,2407480," This is a single Emacs process that casts two frames."
2407480,2413080," But the sections within the frame are called windows."
2413080,2413720," X5."
2413720,2414760," And thank you so much."
2414760,2415080," Thank you."
2415080,2417320," But I mean, I don't really use separate frames that often."
2417320,2418680," So that's why I don't know."
2418680,2419000," Right."
2419000,2420840," And who knows why it is like that?"
2420840,2423720," Who knows why the terminology is like that?"
2423720,2426280," So I'm going to bring the chat in here, actually."
2426280,2428680," Is that Tmux and Emacs?"
2428680,2430440," Well, yeah, it has a built in Tmux."
2430440,2431160," Because old."
2431160,2431480," Yeah."
2432520,2439640," Emacs existed because the concept of GUI window, before concept of GUI window, didn't even exist."
2439640,2440840," Think about it."
2440840,2448120," Emacs was already there before GUI, as a concept invented by Xerox and stuff like that, didn't"
2448120,2448920," fucking exist."
2450360,2452920," And that's why these sections are called windows."
2452920,2458200," Because at the time when GUI concept didn't exist, it was the most logical thing to call it."
2458200,2459880," Call them windows."
2462840,2463720," Right."
2463720,2469080," And so once the GUI concept appeared, now you need to use a different name for that."
2469080,2471960," Because all the documentation refers to these things as windows."
2471960,2472200," Right."
2472200,2474120," So, and they decided to call it frame."
2474120,2474360," Right."
2474360,2475800," So Emacs can have several frames."
2475800,2478040," And within the frame, you can have several windows and stuff like that."
2478040,2480040," So it's kind of interesting."
2480040,2484920," Again, about losing this intrinsic knowledge over time."
2484920,2487080," At the time that name made sense."
2487080,2491400," But as the time goes on, things keep changing."
2491400,2496280," And you look at the same thing in the future, from into the past, from the future."
2496280,2498680," And it's just like, it doesn't make any sense anymore."
2498680,2502120," It doesn't make any sense anymore."
2502120,2506520," Anyways."
2506520,2508760," So that's why it's called frames."
2508760,2512120," And frame, default frame a list."
2512120,2516040," It's basically a list of parameters to set for the frame."
2516040,2516280," Right."
2516280,2517240," For your current frame."
2517240,2518760," Which is kind of cool."
2520200,2522520," So you can set the width and height of this thing."
2522520,2526280," And you can also set the font for the frame."
2526280,2530520," When you're customizing the font, you're setting for the frame."
2530520,2531480," Not for the window."
2531480,2532520," Right."
2532520,2537880," So, and there's also a version of Emacs that doesn't have any windows."
2537880,2538040," Right."
2538040,2540520," So you can do Emacs and W."
2540520,2544280," And it creates this version of Emacs that is, you know, terminal."
2544280,2545560," And it also works."
2545560,2547720," And it doesn't have any frames."
2547720,2549640," Maybe technically it does have frame."
2549640,2550840," But it's a single frame."
2550840,2552440," Right."
2552440,2555400," So, and because of that, when you're customizing the font."
2555400,2557880," You're not customizing it for window or for Emacs itself."
2557880,2559560," You're customizing it for a frame."
2559560,2559880," Right."
2559880,2562920," Since terminal Emacs doesn't have concept of frames."
2562920,2564120," It doesn't make sense there."
2564120,2565400," I think."
2565400,2566360," I think that's how it works."
2566360,2567640," But it might be wrong actually."
2567640,2568920," Right."
2568920,2570280," But that's roughly what it means."
2574040,2574840," Anyways."
2574840,2575240," Anyways."
2575240,2575240," Anyways."
2575240,2575720," Anyways."
2575720,2577400," So here I just add parameters."
2577400,2577640," Right."
2577640,2577960," So."
2577960,2581160," And one of the parameters for the frame is going to be a font."
2581160,2582520," Yosefka."
2582520,2583960," Ayosefka."
2583960,2585080," How do you pronounce this?"
2585080,2586760," Is that like a Yosefka?"
2586760,2588920," Or Ayosefka?"
2588920,2590440," Or Ayosefka?"
2591080,2593640," I think I'm going to call it Ayosefka."
2593640,2595240," It's a Yosefka."
2595240,2596680," I kind of like Ayyo."
2596680,2599240," Yosef Efka."
2599240,2599480," Okay."
2599480,2600840," Ayyo."
2600840,2602680," Ayosefka."
2611320,2611880," So."
2611880,2612600," And as far as I know."
2612600,2613240," After that."
2613240,2614680," We'll have to restart Emacs."
2614680,2615080," I think."
2615080,2615320," Yeah."
2615320,2616200," So we just edit it."
2616200,2617160," And we'll have to restart."
2617160,2618440," So I'm going to restart my Emacs."
2618440,2621800," Something good."
2621800,2622600," Fucky-wackish."
2622600,2623160," Honestly."
2623160,2623880," I don't."
2623880,2624120," Well."
2624120,2624440," I mean."
2624440,2625720," Yeah."
2625720,2626680," So."
2626680,2630280," Something didn't fucking work."
2630280,2631320," Oh."
2631320,2633320," You also need to load that."
2633320,2634360," All right."
2634360,2637160," That's kind of bizarre."
2637160,2639560," So you set the custom file to that."
2640760,2641800," All right."
2641800,2642120," So."
2642120,2643240," But that's."
2643240,2645560," Can I just load the file?"
2645560,2648760," No."
2648760,2649400," Emacs."
2649400,2649880," Custom."
2649880,2650200," Dot."
2650200,2650440," L."
2650440,2652920," Uh-huh."
2652920,2653800," So."
2653800,2655240," Customize."
2655240,2657160," Vim."
2657160,2660200," Gruber Darker."
2660200,2661560," All right."
2661560,2663000," So."
2663000,2663480," And."
2663480,2665080," I think I saved it here."
2665080,2667720," I think I just didn't have that."
2667720,2667960," Like."
2667960,2669320," Custom enabled Vims."
2669320,2669480," Right."
2669480,2670520," So it's a Gruber Darker."
2671480,2672440," Display lines."
2672440,2673720," Package selected."
2673720,2674280," Yeah."
2674280,2675000," So I think."
2675000,2676680," I think maybe I just forgot to do that."
2676680,2678840," And I feel like you don't have to load this file."
2678840,2679080," Right."
2679080,2679560," So."
2679560,2681000," If I just do something like that."
2681000,2682280," Uh."
2682280,2682680," No."
2682680,2683160," It's still."
2683160,2684040," It still does that."
2684040,2684280," That's."
2684280,2684920," That's bizarre."
2684920,2685640," So."
2685640,2689000," How does that make any sense?"
2689000,2690280," Can anybody explain to me?"
2690280,2692440," Can anybody explain."
2692440,2692760," Like."
2692760,2694520," why you have to load it?"
2694520,2699400," That's absolutely bizarre."
2699400,2701240," Right."
2701240,2701720," Because."
2701720,2703000," I said custom file."
2703000,2705560," Uh."
2705560,2705880," Right."
2706680,2707160," Well I mean."
2707160,2707480," Yeah."
2707480,2708760," I probably want to actually do."
2708760,2709560," Uh."
2709560,2710360," Load custom."
2710360,2710680," Thank you."
2710680,2711400," Thank you so much chat."
2711400,2712440," Thank you so much."
2712440,2712920," Uh."
2712920,2714600," Custom file."
2714600,2715320," No error."
2715320,2715800," But."
2715800,2717000," Is no error really."
2717000,2718200," Uh."
2718200,2719240," Necessary in here."
2720600,2721480," So it's a function."
2721480,2723800," And there's no error."
2723800,2724120," No."
2724120,2725320," No error in here."
2725320,2727160," There's no."
2727160,2727640," No error."
2727640,2731400," Why did you say no error?"
2731400,2733000," Because it doesn't accept."
2733000,2734520," According to the documentation."
2734520,2735000," Are you?"
2735000,2738680," Are you an LLM?"
2738680,2740520," That just hallucinated some stuff."
2740520,2744200," I use old."
2744200,2744440," Ah."
2744440,2744680," Okay."
2744680,2745880," So."
2745880,2746920," In the modern Emacs."
2746920,2747480," It."
2747480,2748760," It doesn't have that stuff."
2748760,2749800," It's a GPT user."
2749800,2750120," Okay."
2751400,2751720," Uh."
2751720,2751960," Right."
2751960,2753080," So because according to the documentation."
2753080,2753640," It's just that."
2753640,2753960," Right."
2753960,2754680," So I mean."
2754680,2754920," Yeah."
2754920,2756920," So we can just do it like that."
2756920,2757400," But I mean."
2757400,2758440," Using the same thing."
2758440,2759080," Makes sense."
2759080,2760520," So we don't duplicate the."
2760520,2761480," The same thing."
2761480,2762360," Over and over again."
2762360,2763480," If I open it like this."
2763480,2764840," Look at that."
2764840,2766600," Isn't that beautiful?"
2766600,2768760," The only thing that kind of."
2768760,2769720," Pieces me off."
2769720,2770760," Is this."
2770760,2771800," God damn splash."
2771800,2773720," Like."
2773720,2774600," Why do you have this."
2774600,2775000," God damn."
2775000,2776040," Emacs tutorial."
2776040,2776840," Emacs guide."
2776840,2778520," To who do you think I am?"
2778520,2779640," Do you think I'm some sort of."
2779640,2780680," A Vim user?"
2780680,2781960," Who doesn't know how to use."
2781960,2783320," A proper text editor?"
2783320,2784680," Like what?"
2784680,2785000," What?"
2785000,2787480," We need to disable that."
2787480,2789240," So as far as I know."
2789240,2790280," It's just like a splash."
2790280,2790840," Or something."
2791400,2791880," Uh."
2791880,2791960," Uh."
2791960,2792360," Uh."
2792360,2792440," Uh."
2792440,2792440," Uh."
2792440,2793000," Uh."
2793000,2794480," Okay."
2794480,2795560," So let me go."
2795560,2796120," I think it's."
2796120,2796840," In some other."
2796840,2797240," Like."
2797240,2798760," I developed."
2798760,2800120," This config."
2800120,2801400," When I was very young."
2801400,2802600," And I really like this."
2802600,2802920," You know."
2802920,2804520," Over complicated architecture."
2804520,2805240," And stuff like that."
2805240,2806840," So I split it into several files."
2806840,2808120," I have no idea why."
2808120,2809240," It's kind of stupid."
2809240,2810760," So it's probably in some other file."
2812040,2813080," So let me see."
2813080,2814920," So something about splash."
2814920,2816280," Let's find the splash."
2816280,2816760," Oh yeah."
2816760,2818040," So set default."
2818040,2819400," Inhibit splash screen."
2819400,2821640," So this is a very important variable."
2821640,2824680," Actually this file could be very important."
2824680,2825000," Right."
2825000,2826840," So inhibit splash screen."
2826840,2828840," It's one of the variables that we have in here."
2828840,2830040," Uh."
2830040,2830760," Okay again."
2830760,2832600," So."
2832600,2834120," I think."
2834120,2836360," Maybe I can customize this variable."
2836360,2837000," Customize."
2837000,2838600," Variable."
2838600,2841640," Inhibit splash screen."
2841640,2843560," And its value is off."
2843560,2845320," We're gonna toggle it."
2845320,2846200," Now it's on."
2846200,2847560," And I'm gonna save it."
2847560,2851240," And I suppose that also puts that into the custom."
2851240,2852600," I really like having a custom."
2852600,2855320," Like a custom stuff in a separate file."
2855320,2855960," Thank you so much."
2855960,2858040," I guess like."
2858040,2861880," I'm actually super glad I decided to do the stream today."
2861880,2863480," Because I actually learned things."
2863480,2865160," You guys are teaching me about Emacs."
2865160,2866040," That's very cool."
2866040,2868840," I'm a Veeam user."
2868840,2869880," I feel personal attack."
2869880,2870200," Good."
2870200,2871880," Good."
2871880,2872600," You wanna."
2872600,2874600," You wanna hear another personal attack?"
2874600,2877160," You wanna hear another personal attack?"
2877160,2877560," Listen."
2877560,2878120," Listen."
2878120,2880600," I open Veeam RC in Emacs."
2881720,2882040," Right."
2882040,2884200," And it doesn't highlight shit."
2884200,2886440," Like it doesn't highlight."
2886440,2889720," Emacs does not recognize by default Veeam."
2889720,2890840," It just doesn't recognize it."
2890840,2891480," It doesn't exist."
2891480,2893160," It's a non-existing text editor."
2893160,2894120," Veeam."
2894120,2895720," Emacs."
2895720,2897640," Custom dot L."
2899160,2899800," What is that?"
2899800,2899800," What is that?"
2899800,2900920," Oh."
2900920,2903000," How cute."
2903000,2905560," So it recognize it."
2905560,2910840," Emacs doesn't even know Veeam freaking exists."
2910840,2914760," Veeam has to add support for Emacs."
2914760,2918760," Because it's a real text editor that is used by serious people."
2918760,2928600," And sometimes serious people need to SSH to some machine and edit some dot L files and they get really pissed off when it doesn't highlight it properly."
2929400,2929960," So yeah."
2929960,2933240," Veeam has to add support for that."
2933240,2943400," I have a lot of things like that."
2943960,2945320," Dude, dude, dude, dude."
2945320,2952440," I've been a professional text editor warrior for decades."
2952440,2952840," Bruh."
2952840,2954680," Right."
2954680,2958520," So new zoomers come in and starting talking to me."
2958520,2959800," Ah, your text editor is shit."
2959800,2965080," I've been doing text editor wars for fucking decades."
2965080,2967640," I can give you examples like that."
2967640,2969480," Like all the day."
2969480,2970680," Right."
2970680,2973080," I can show you something interesting as well."
2973080,2974360," Right."
2974360,2976120," Why Emacs is more superior."
2976120,2978440," Like open something like index.php."
2978440,2980040," Right."
2980040,2983000," It doesn't recognize that."
2983000,2984840," PHP is not a real language."
2984840,2986360," But then"
2986360,2989800," Veeam opens PHP and it does recognize that."
2989800,2991720," Ew."
2991720,2993160," Ew."
2993160,2994120," Ew."
2994120,2996840," Disgusting."
2996840,2999160," Disgusting."
2999160,3003000," And Emacs just doesn't deal with kind of languages."
3003000,3006680," And I know that this argument contradicts to the previous argument."
3006680,3008200," And that is intentional, by the way."
3012680,3013160," Anyway."
3013160,3019720," That's kind of the point of these stupid words, isn't it?"
3019720,3020680," That's kind of the point."
3020680,3026200," It's to just use arguments in a contradicting way as it's convenient."
3026200,3026600," Right."
3026600,3028760," And have double stanzas as well."
3028760,3029720," That's kind of the point."
3029720,3032120," Because the whole argument is fucking stupid."
3032120,3034680," Might as well, you know, continue saying stupid shit."
3035400,3036600," So yeah."
3036600,3041080," Anyways."
3041080,3041640," So."
3041640,3044200," Let's go."
3044200,3046520," Let's go."
3046520,3047240," Let's go."
3047240,3048280," So customize."
3048280,3049800," Darker."
3049800,3050760," And stuff like that."
3051480,3052440," And yeah."
3052440,3057480," But in all seriousness, I think it doesn't really freaking matter."
3057480,3057800," Right."
3057800,3059560," So again, which text editor you use."
3059560,3059800," Right."
3059800,3062280," So at the end of the day, it's for editing text files."
3063320,3067320," You can create cool software with mousepad."
3067320,3069880," Right."
3069880,3072280," So mousepad is an acceptable text editor."
3072280,3074360," It even has like a highlighting of things."
3074360,3077240," So let's actually configure, you know, mousepads."
3077240,3079880," So let's write."
3079880,3083080," You may think that the mousepad is kind of like a stupid text editor."
3083080,3083800," Right."
3083800,3090120," So I can, you know, increase this stuff and I can maybe create some hello world."
3090120,3094280," Why would anyone want to program in this stupid text editor?"
3094280,3095640," So let's finish the hello world."
3095640,3098040," But it's highly customizable."
3098040,3103240," So for instance, I don't like this font."
3103240,3103480," Right."
3103480,3104600," So you can change the font."
3105320,3107480," So view."
3107480,3108440," Okay."
3108440,3111480," So let's put I/O Sevka."
3111480,3114040," I/O Sevka regular."
3114040,3115240," Regular."
3115240,3118360," And I like 18 points, actually."
3118360,3122440," I think something like 18 points is perfect."
3122440,3124040," Right."
3124040,3125560," And there you go."
3125560,3128200," It already looks much better."
3128200,3129800," So you can show line numbers."
3129800,3130760," It's kind of difficult to see."
3130760,3133880," But this is because the color theme is non-existent."
3133880,3135400," I kind of like a bold."
3135400,3135720," Right."
3135720,3136760," So here is that."
3136760,3141000," I can maybe manually increase the amount of stuff in here."
3141000,3142440," We can display white spaces."
3142440,3143400," So here is the top."
3143400,3145160," Right."
3145160,3147160," So highlight current line."
3147160,3148920," So you can highlight the current line."
3148920,3149880," Matching brackets."
3149880,3151000," Wrap along lines."
3151560,3152760," So tab width."
3152760,3157000," I would prefer to keep tab width 4 and use spaces instead of tabs."
3157000,3160680," So it looks something like this."
3160680,3160920," Right."
3160920,3165080," So and in terms of window, I think that's about it."
3165080,3166200," Another thing you can do."
3166200,3168600," You can actually set a file type markup."
3168600,3173720," Maybe something like source code C."
3173720,3174120," And there we go."
3174120,3174680," You have highlight."
3174680,3176600," So this is like, you can already use that."
3176600,3183160," So do you remember how it looked at the beginning?"
3184840,3187960," But now like you can actually develop shit and it pretty comfortably."
3187960,3188280," All right."
3188280,3190040," So there are different themes and stuff like that."
3190040,3191800," So Kate theme."
3191800,3195640," If you're into like a bright themes, Oblivion, that's a little bit better."
3195640,3197000," Tango."
3197000,3199560," But I kind of for this one, I kind of like a bold."
3199560,3203080," So yeah, it doesn't freaking matters."
3203080,3203880," It's pretty convenient."
3205160,3206520," And people use this, by the way."
3206520,3207480," People actually use this."
3207480,3215960," Casual no solarize dark."
3215960,3218600," Honestly, like I didn't intentionally ignore it."
3218600,3221080," I kind of don't like it, unfortunately."
3221080,3224760," It's too low contrast."
3224760,3227640," I have a little bit of a problem with my vision because I like."
3227640,3229400," And that's why I wear glasses."
3229400,3232440," And I kind of prefer more contrast for my themes."
3232440,3232760," All right."
3232760,3235080," So it's just like the colors are cool."
3235080,3238200," It's just like if only it had more contrast."
3238200,3238440," Right."
3238440,3240760," If only it had more contrast, I would probably like it more."
3240760,3241720," Yeah."
3241720,3243160," It's too low contrast for me."
3243160,3245560," So something like Cobalt is a good one."
3245560,3246920," Right."
3246920,3247400," So."
3247400,3250120," All right."
3250120,3253720," So and the Groover Darker also has like a very good contrast."
3253720,3254760," And that's why I like it as well."
3254760,3257080," So does anybody remember what I was doing?"
3257080,3261080," Does anybody remember?"
3261080,3263000," So I was trying to inhibit splash screen."
3263000,3265160," So that's probably what I was doing."
3265160,3265480," Okay."
3265480,3267160," So emacs customize."
3267160,3269480," Write custom."
3269480,3269720," Okay."
3269720,3270120," That's cool."
3270120,3272440," So make backup files."
3272440,3272760," Okay."
3272760,3277400," So this one is interesting, actually, because emacs has a very nasty habit."
3277400,3280440," So let's actually take a look at this stuff."
3282120,3284520," So let's go to probe."
3284520,3293000," The latest emacs actually tells me how much gigabytes is available in the current drive."
3293000,3294600," What the fuck?"
3294600,3300200," So, and the version of emacs is 29.4."
3300200,3304680," On my old laptop, I was using, it was using actually 2028 or something."
3305400,3305720," Right."
3305720,3306840," So 28 or something."
3306840,3309080," Technology Poggy."
3309080,3309560," Exactly."
3309560,3310440," All right."
3310440,3311960," So let's create main scene."
3311960,3312440," Right."
3312440,3314280," And what I can do."
3314280,3315080," I can do."
3315080,3315560," Oh, my God."
3315560,3316440," This is so cool."
3316440,3317640," Finally, I'm at home."
3317640,3319960," Oh, it."
3319960,3325080," Do you want to, do you want me to show something interesting?"
3325080,3329880," So here is the, like, how emacs indents things."
3329880,3335960," So if you actually have four spaces somewhere."
3335960,3337480," Oh, it doesn't do that anymore."
3337480,3339480," Oh, I think it's just a second."
3339480,3340440," It's so stupid."
3340440,3344680," Yeah."
3344680,3351560," So by default, it indents with spaces."
3351560,3354440," But as soon as you hit eight spaces, it just uses a step."
3354440,3357240," It just fucking uses a step all of a sudden."
3357240,3360920," Yeah, I hate C mode so much."
3360920,3362920," It's so goddamn fucking stupid."
3362920,3365640," The official C mode is just fucking stupid."
3365640,3368120," You have to spend time configuring it and stuff."
3368120,3369640," Right."
3369640,3372280," So you have to really spend time configuring it."
3372280,3376200," And that's why I use simpc."
3376200,3377800," All right."
3377800,3380040," So I can actually show you simpc."
3380040,3381560," And it's not even that fast."
3381560,3384600," It's just like it's so fucking slow."
3384600,3384760," Right."
3384760,3386120," So here is the simpc."
3386120,3390280," It's basically a simple version of C mode."
3390280,3395480," And justification for that is that the C mode doesn't work with big files."
3395480,3397160," I think I already showed that multiple times."
3397160,3401560," If you try to open, for example, Amalgamated SQLite 3."
3401560,3407720," And for those who doesn't know, Amalgamated SQLite 3 is you take all of the files of the source code of"
3408280,3413640," SQLite and concatenate them into a single file and compile it as an executable."
3413640,3416840," It is a thing that people do, actually."
3416840,3421960," It's just like it enables more optimizations because the compiler knows how different functions interact"
3421960,3422680," with each other."
3422680,3427880," And if I download this entire thing, so we can even, yeah."
3427880,3432440," So the size of this entire thing is seven megabytes, essentially."
3432440,3432680," Right."
3432680,3435240," So it's seven megabytes, almost eight megabytes."
3435240,3440200," So we can also maybe do something like compile, compile."
3440200,3440840," Compile."
3440840,3441160," Right."
3441160,3444600," So cat SQLite WCL."
3444600,3449000," It has 222,000 lines of code."
3449000,3450520," Right."
3450520,3453400," So that's how many lines of code it has."
3453400,3453960," You try to..."
3453960,3454760," I'm opening it."
3454760,3456040," Right."
3456040,3457400," So I open it."
3457400,3458760," And then I try to scroll it."
3458760,3459880," So I'm..."
3459880,3461480," I'm trying to scroll..."
3461480,3461720," Oh!"
3463400,3465400," Okay, I'm going to the next line."
3465400,3466680," Right."
3466680,3468280," And it didn't go there right away."
3468280,3469720," Right."
3469720,3470840," So let's actually open it."
3470840,3472760," So it takes some time to open."
3472760,3475720," I instructed to go to the last line."
3475720,3478440," One, two, three."
3478440,3481640," It takes several seconds to go there."
3481640,3484120," Actually, I just realized that I'm on a new computer."
3484120,3484600," Right."
3484600,3488200," But even on a new computer, look how much time it takes."
3488200,3490280," It's fucking insane."
3490280,3492200," Like, it's fucking insane how much time it takes."
3493000,3493640," Right."
3493640,3495880," And I'm also using SSD."
3495880,3498920," Guys, I'm also using SSD."
3498920,3500760," Go to the end file."
3500760,3503240," One, two, three, four."
3503240,3504200," What the fuck is that?"
3504200,3506360," Modern computer."
3506360,3507560," Modern computer."
3507560,3508120," SSD."
3508120,3509960," What the fuck is four seconds?"
3509960,3512600," Now, let me show you something interesting."
3512600,3515240," I'm going to rename this entire thing to TXT."
3515240,3515480," Right."
3515480,3517240," I'm just renaming it to TXT."
3517240,3517880," I open it up."
3517880,3519480," It opened instantly."
3519480,3520680," I instructed go to the end."
3520680,3522600," It went instantly."
3522600,3527160," Computer is fast."
3527160,3528760," Hard drive is fast."
3528760,3530440," Emacs is fast."
3530440,3532280," Freaking C-MODE."
3532280,3534360," Freaking C-MODE."
3534360,3535240," Who developed it?"
3535240,3539960," I want to look into the eyes of the people who developed C-MODE for Emacs."
3539960,3541800," What the fuck?"
3541800,3547240," Why are you undermining the success of your favorite text editor?"
3547240,3554440," By all of this crap, by all of this blood, you are undermining Emacs."
3554440,3557640," The very fucking text editor that you like and use."
3557640,3564760," I swear to God, there's some sort of Vim spies among the Emacs developers."
3564760,3566920," There's Vim imposters."
3566920,3573160," They're intentionally putting slips in all of this mode to make Emacs appear slow."
3574280,3576040," Because by itself, it's fast."
3576040,3578840," It is fucking fast."
3578840,3580120," So Vim sabotage."
3580120,3580520," Exactly."
3580520,3581800," Anyway."
3581800,3584120," Right."
3584120,3587640," And that's why I created C-MODE to combat that."
3587640,3587880," Right."
3587880,3591320," And I wonder if C-MODE is actually available in Emacs packages."
3591320,3591960," It's probably not."
3591960,3593640," It's probably not available."
3593640,3595560," So let's actually see C-MODE."
3595560,3596680," No, it's not available."
3596680,3596920," Right."
3596920,3597720," Of course."
3597720,3598280," Of course."
3598280,3603080," These Vim imposters among the Emacs developers,"
3603080,3607160," they're actually preventing actual genuine Emacs developers to"
3607160,3610840," adding this C-MODE to the official repos."
3610840,3612600," They're fucking doing that."
3612600,3613720," They're fucking doing that."
3613720,3616360," Because that exposes them."
3616360,3621880," The imposters."
3621880,3622520," Exactly."
3622520,3623160," The imposters."
3624760,3626600," Vim fucking imposters."
3626600,3633320," So, and the thing is, the way I install C-MODE, by the way,"
3633320,3636600," the way I install it is, actually, I have a folder, usually,"
3636600,3638840," which is called Emacs local."
3638840,3639000," Right."
3639000,3640120," So it is called Emacs local."
3640120,3641160," So it should go somewhere."
3641160,3643320," Rexim.files."
3643320,3645240," And by the way, Rexim is my nickname."
3645240,3646760," My usual personal nickname."
3646760,3651400," Tsoiding is the name of the project of recreational programming."
3651400,3651720," Right."
3651720,3653960," So, and that's why you can see me online"
3653960,3656120," as either Rexim or Sodding."
3656120,3656360," Right."
3656360,3660600," So, can people treat Sodding as my name, as my nickname?"
3660600,3661720," Which is fine, I guess."
3661720,3664360," I guess, by now, it's my second nickname."
3664360,3664840," Right."
3664840,3666280," So, or Alexei."
3666280,3668120," Well, I mean, it's my personal name."
3668120,3669000," Actual legal name."
3671560,3680200," So, yeah, I have a .emacs.local."
3680200,3684840," So it's for things that are not part of any repo."
3684840,3688600," So I just copy these files in there and I just load them from there."
3688600,3689400," So that's it."
3689400,3691640," So it's actually very easy, very convenient."
3691640,3695480," And I suppose one of the things I want to do, I want to sim link that specific folder."
3696440,3696680," Right."
3696680,3698440," So let me go into the manifest."
3698440,3702200," So I commented out linking Emacs locals."
3702200,3705000," So let me quickly uncomment it."
3705000,3711320," And I'm going to just do deploy."
3712360,3716760," And that automatically sim linked the whole thing."
3716760,3717000," Right."
3717000,3720120," So it's sim linked it into the into the home folder."
3720120,3727080," So, yeah, I'm basically using sim links for for my conflicts, but I'm not using Stow, Gnu Stow."
3727080,3727640," Right."
3727640,3730200," So I've already talked in one of the previous streams."
3730200,3730280," Right."
3730280,3731800," So Gnu Stow is very popular."
3731800,3735160," Some YouTubers popularize this thing for for their config and stuff like that."
3735160,3739640," But I use this kind of approach, this kind of approach for very long time."
3739640,3739960," Right."
3739960,3747320," So essentially, I have just manifest file, which describes how I want to link certain files within the repo."
3747320,3747800," Right."
3747800,3753080," And then I have a simple bash script that parses that manifest file and just like links everything"
3753080,3753640," accordingly."
3753640,3755240," And it's 50 lines of code, actually."
3755240,3756040," It's very simple."
3756040,3758280," That's the entirety of the thing."
3758280,3762760," So as far as Gnu Stow is a Perl script, and it's probably bigger than this."
3763640,3767080," But this serves the purpose of Gnu Stow really fucking well."
3767080,3770280," And comments that, yeah, comments work."
3770280,3772920," Comments work because I'm doing this kind of stuff."
3772920,3773240," Right."
3773240,3777480," So I'm just like, I'm iterating the lines of manifest file."
3777480,3781800," I'm matching them against expression, regular expression that checks for the comments."
3781800,3781960," Right."
3781960,3783160," And it just ignores those things."
3783160,3784840," And then it just separates them like that."
3784840,3786040," It's very simple."
3786040,3787000," It's very straightforward."
3787000,3790200," It's very straightforward."
3790200,3793720," So, yeah, it works."
3793720,3796600," I even have a variant for Windows."
3796600,3797400," Look at that."
3797400,3806680," I have deploy.ps1 because, again, I used to use the same configuration repo for also my Windows setup."
3806680,3808760," And this thing is written in PowerShell."
3808760,3811880," So I rewrote this entire thing in PowerShell."
3811880,3814680," So this is actually just the front-end."
3814680,3820920," The actual implementation of the parser and deployer is in .file.psm1."
3820920,3821160," Right."
3821160,3821880," So it's a module."
3821880,3822680," Right."
3822680,3823800," So you simlink file."
3823800,3826360," You can even un-simlink stuff."
3826360,3826680," Right."
3826680,3828120," So this is written in PowerShell."
3828120,3828760," Yeah."
3828760,3834760," So the idea was that I have a single repo for both Linux and Windows."
3835400,3838760," And they use the same manifest files."
3838760,3839000," Right."
3839000,3842120," I even have, like, a separate manifest file for Linux, for instance."
3842120,3843160," Manifest Linux."
3843160,3845640," So this is for both Windows and Linux."
3845640,3848680," And this is only for Linux that doesn't work on Windows."
3848680,3849080," Right."
3849080,3851480," And all of that is synced up."
3851480,3852840," And all of that is in a single place."
3852840,3854680," But I don't really use Windows anymore."
3854680,3858280," So the Windows part of this config is kind of obsolete at this point."
3858280,3861000," This is, yeah, it's actually pretty cool."
3861000,3864440," I wasn't really into these kind of things in the past."
3864440,3867400," Now I'm just old and depressed and I don't give a shit."
3867400,3870760," Right."
3870760,3875880," You can literally give me, like, a notepad and a shitty C compiler and I will just use it."
3875880,3880200," Because that's how fucking tired and depressed of all of this tech yapping I am."
3880200,3881880," Because I've been doing that for decades."
3881880,3884600," And I'm just tired."
3884600,3886120," I'm just like, I don't want to do that anymore."
3889960,3891480," And I just don't want to do that anymore."
3891480,3897640," How come your decision of void Linux?"
3897640,3899880," I just wanted to try it."
3899880,3904280," MSVC and notepad is based."
3904280,3904520," Yeah."
3904520,3910920," A lot of actually, like, really hardcore low-level developers on Windows just use MSVC for compiling"
3910920,3911640," and debugging."
3911640,3914760," And for editing, they use usually something else."
3914760,3916600," Like a proper text editor."
3916600,3920760," Maybe like a Sublime or Emacs or whatever."
3920760,3921720," Notepad++."
3921720,3924200," Notepad, CMD, NCL."
3924200,3924840," Yeah, exactly."
3924840,3932040," The funny is that these days, I primarily use only, like, three programs on my machine."
3932040,3934440," 80% of the time."
3934440,3939080," It's text editor, terminal, and the browser."
3939080,3941160," Because browser is the new operating system."
3941160,3945960," And the operating system kind of took a role of bias, essentially."
3945960,3947400," Right."
3947400,3953080," So, operating system is more like a supervisor for actual operating system, which is a browser these days."
3953080,3954040," Right."
3954040,3958600," So, anyways."
3958600,3962680," So, that's pretty boogers."
3962680,3967800," What I was doing, I think I was talking about, yeah, backup files."
3968440,3968840," Okay."
3968840,3972200," So, I sim-linked the Emacs local."
3972200,3974200," So, and that means..."
3974200,3975080," Yeah."
3975080,3976440," So, here's the simpc mode."
3976440,3977880," It's very simple."
3977880,3984120," And does it do outer mode, outer load?"
3984120,3985080," It probably doesn't."
3985080,3986120," Right."
3986120,3986840," It probably doesn't."
3986840,3989880," So, I will have to explicitly disable c-mod first."
3989880,3999400," And then assign, you know, simpc mode on the .c files."
3999400,4003160," On the .c files."
4003160,4005480," I'll get some subs that I probably didn't acknowledge."
4005480,4009240," Thank you so much, John D'Resta, for Twitch Implication with a message."
4009240,4013960," Now that you have a new laptop, you can finally give Visual Studio Code a try Pepe Love W."
4013960,4015880," I already tried Visual Studio Code."
4016520,4019240," So, even on my old laptop."
4019240,4020600," And I absolutely fucking hate it."
4020600,4024520," Because the first thing Visual Studio Code does when you first pop it up,"
4024520,4029080," it reminds me that it was created by Microsoft."
4029080,4034280," It starts bugging you insanely with different shitty pop-ups all over the place."
4034280,4035640," Oh, it's not that plug."
4035640,4036520," It's not that plug."
4036520,4039400," I'm a Microsoft software."
4039400,4039800," Fuck you."
4039800,4041080," This is not your computer anymore."
4041080,4041880," This is my computer."
4041880,4042760," I'm going to modify things."
4042760,4043480," I'm going to do same."
4043480,4044920," Fuck off."
4044920,4046200," X kill that bitch."
4046200,4047480," X fucking kill it."
4047480,4048600," So, it's just like, no."
4048600,4049480," I'm not installing it."
4049480,4050600," I tried it some time ago."
4050600,4051720," I just like, can't fucking use it."
4051720,4053000," It's so goddamn annoying."
4053000,4054680," It's so goddamn fucking annoying."
4054680,4056920," It's like you can feel that it was created by Microsoft."
4058920,4060200," Kill man that bitch."
4060200,4060440," Kill man that bitch."
4060440,4060840," Yeah."
4060840,4063000," Exactly."
4063000,4069480," Video's called is ass, but I use it because I basically always use it."
4069480,4070200," It's understandable."
4070200,4070600," Right."
4070600,4075240," So, I'm being dramatic and exaggerating because I'm strained right now, but at the end of the day,"
4075240,4083320," I do understand you, I kind of don't like Emacs either because how overbloated it is and how quirky it is."
4083320,4091080," But unfortunately, Emacs has a few killer apps that I just don't know how to fucking replace."
4091800,4095080," One of the killer apps it has is compilation mode."
4095080,4095800," Right."
4095800,4099720," So, I know that Vim is capable of doing the same thing."
4099720,4100520," I know that."
4100520,4104680," But compilation mode, first of all, works out of the box."
4104680,4108680," And by default, all of the settings work exactly as you want."
4108680,4114920," It is insane because it's just like, it just works as it's supposed to work right away out of the box."
4114920,4116680," And it's just like, you want to keep using it."
4116680,4120120," So, in compilation mode is essentially, it allows you to run an external program."
4121240,4128440," It collects the output of the external program and parses it and looks for file colon row."
4128440,4129720," Right."
4129720,4136520," And turns it into a linkable, clickable link, which you can click and it automatically jumps to that place."
4136520,4142200," I know Vim can do that, but it's just not as convenient as in Emacs."
4142200,4144120," It's just like not as convenient."
4144120,4145720," So, there is a compiler in Vim."
4145720,4147080," Well, maybe we can try that."
4147080,4150440," But I mean, it's just like, this is an absolute killer feature."
4150440,4156760," It's such a fucking killer feature that I try to implement it as a separate application in Rust."
4156760,4160040," So, there is a thing called CM compilation mode."
4160040,4162920," So, Emacs compilation mode, like TUI application."
4162920,4167160," So, and the point of this entire thing, I think there is even a demo in here."
4167160,4167720," Look at that."
4167720,4172040," It's a ASCII demo, which demonstrates how it works."
4172040,4172280," Right."
4172280,4174520," So, you have a source code file."
4174520,4176920," You GCC this file and it's not going to compile."
4176920,4177800," Look at that."
4177800,4178120," Right."
4178120,4180520," So, you redirect that into CM."
4180520,4182520," Right."
4182520,4186280," And it basically allows, it parses everything."
4186280,4190760," It allows you to actually jump to the places through any text editor."
4190760,4194360," So, here I use Emacs, but then you can customize it to use Vim, actually."
4194360,4195720," Right."
4195720,4205240," So, I was trying to take the compilation mode of Emacs and basically make it integratable with any text editor."
4205240,4206360," Right."
4206360,4208200," Make it integratable with any text editor."
4208200,4209720," But it didn't really go anywhere."
4210280,4213320," Maybe I'm going to go into that in the future."
4213320,4213640," Right."
4213640,4213960," We'll see."
4213960,4214360," We'll see."
4214360,4217000," Maybe in the future, we'll go back to this thing."
4217000,4218120," Right."
4218120,4219960," So, let me actually put that in the description."
4219960,4221880," Right."
4221880,4227560," And another thing I probably want to put in here is Simp C mode."
4227560,4227880," Right."
4227880,4229080," Simp C mode."
4229080,4232120," So, for me, this compilation mode is an absolute killer feature."
4232120,4233400," So, do I have C?"
4233400,4235080," So, I think I lost it."
4235080,4238760," So, I'm going to go to Probe and..."
4238760,4243640," I think I need to restart Image, just in case."
4243640,4247320," It's pretty convenient, actually."
4247320,4247960," Already."
4247960,4249800," It's already usable, honestly."
4249800,4251080," It's already usable."
4251080,4252040," So, I'm going to remove that."
4252040,4254040," Main C."
4254040,4254680," Okay."
4254680,4256920," So, let's create a Hello World."
4256920,4258440," Let's create a Hello World."
4258440,4258840," Main."
4258840,4261640," And I use that compilation mode all the time on my streams."
4261640,4262840," You probably noticed that."
4263400,4264680," You probably already noticed that."
4264680,4266920," That I use it all the time on my streams."
4266920,4267720," Right."
4267720,4269560," And if I try to do compile."
4269560,4272840," Just a second."
4272840,4276280," And I do CCO main main.c."
4276280,4276520," Right."
4276520,4279640," As you can see, it run and collected the output."
4279640,4285160," And now, this thing is a clippable thing that just jumps there."
4285160,4286360," Like, Vim can do that."
4286360,4291320," But I tried to use the Vim thing and I could never get used to that."
4291320,4293000," This one is just way more convenient."
4293400,4294360," It's just way more convenient."
4294360,4294760," I'm sorry."
4294760,4295960," Right."
4295960,4298760," And it just integrates with everything else really well."
4298760,4303960," Another cool feature of Emacs, another killer feature of Emacs that, by the way,"
4303960,4308040," gets attention of a lot of YouTube viewers in the comment section."
4308040,4311000," People in comment section constantly ask me how the fuck I do that."
4311560,4312600," It's DRED mod."
4312600,4314440," It's this thing."
4314440,4318680," It's LS-L that is interactable."
4318680,4321000," You can actually click on things and go there."
4321000,4326920," And furthermore, you can have things like this, where I directly modify this entire thing and it"
4326920,4327960," actually renames things."
4329400,4331560," This is an absolute killer feature."
4331560,4332760," Like, it's so fucking cool."
4332760,4336120," And I don't even scratch the surface of this entire thing."
4336120,4338440," It's so capable of so much more."
4338440,4338760," Yeah."
4338760,4342920," So you have tramp mode, which can actually SSH."
4342920,4343080," Right."
4343080,4345160," So you can do this kind of stuff over SSH."
4345160,4346280," It's fucking insane."
4346280,4347240," Right."
4347240,4350600," So this thing should have been its own separate application."
4350600,4353400," But it's integrated in Emacs, unfortunately."
4353400,4355640," And the third killer app is probably Magit."
4355640,4356840," Right."
4356840,4362360," So I know that a lot of people absolutely hate Emacs,"
4362360,4365480," but they have to use it because Magit is so fucking good."
4365480,4369160," It's probably one of the best Git clients ever."
4369160,4373240," And it's kind of tied to a shitty text editor."
4373240,4375800," It's actually kind of insane."
4375800,4376680," Also org mode."
4376680,4377160," Okay."
4377160,4379560," So these days I don't really use org mode much,"
4379560,4381640," but when I use it, it was actually kind of cool."
4381640,4382360," Right."
4382360,4386360," So it's just like, I know that it's a shady overblown editor,"
4386360,4390600," but there is, it has a bunch of gems like that,"
4390600,4393800," that keeps you kind of vendor lock on that shitty editor."
4393800,4395160," It's, it's freaking insane."
4395160,4399560," And because of that, I can tell you the biggest Emacs haters"
4399560,4404360," are actually active Emacs users because they absolutely hate."
4404360,4407480," this is sort of like a hostages relationship."
4407480,4408440," Right."
4408440,4412760," So the Emacs users feel like hostages to the fucking text editor."
4412760,4414920," They want to get rid of it, but they just fucking can't."
4414920,4416440," Right."
4416440,4418120," And we have Emacs users in the chat."
4418120,4419640," They, they confirm that it is like that."
4419640,4419880," Yeah."
4419880,4420600," So I know that."
4421480,4425320," And it's not, and you don't even develop a Stockholm syndrome towards that."
4425320,4429480," Like, it's just like, it's a very weird hate, hate relationship"
4429480,4430920," between you and the text editor."
4430920,4432120," It's just, it's so weird."
4432120,4433880," So, yeah."
4436520,4440600," Um, so that's, that's basically what we have in here."
4440600,4441560," Yeah."
4441560,4442840," It's, it's a very abusive relationship."
4442840,4443320," That's for sure."
4443320,4446920," It's a very goddamn abusive relationship."
4446920,4448520," So, uh, what do we want you to do?"
4448520,4452760," So let's maybe, uh, install simpc mode, uh, super quick."
4452760,4453800," So where are we?"
4453800,4456840," Emacs, um, dot Emacs."
4456840,4457800," Okay."
4457800,4462360," So now, since I do have Emacs local, right."
4462360,4464760," I can simply load a file."
4464760,4466680," Load file."
4466680,4469640," Maybe after, uh, after all of that stuff."
4469640,4471960," Uh, load file."
4471960,4473800," Emacs."
4473800,4476600," Emacs local."
4476600,4480040," Simpc mode dot L."
4480040,4481560," There we go."
4481560,4482680," So I can load it right away."
4482680,4484520," So it loaded it already."
4484520,4487960," And if I go to main.c, uh,"
4487960,4491880," prevent, sodding, uh, probe, test c."
4491880,4493080," Right."
4493080,4498200," So by default, this doesn't use simpc, but I can probably switch to simpc."
4498200,4498440," Yeah."
4498440,4499640," Now it is simpc."
4499640,4503320," And as far as I know, yeah, it, it actually does indentation properly"
4503320,4504680," because I wrote that mode."
4504680,4504840," Right."
4504840,4506440," So it does everything properly."
4506440,4510760," I kind of like the white space mode in here with dollars and stuff like that."
4511320,4514280," So, oof, there's something."
4514280,4516040," Why does it use tabs sometimes?"
4516040,4518280," Yeah, it still does this tab shit."
4518280,4519960," It still does this tab shit."
4519960,4521960," But anyway, so at least we have simpc mode."
4521960,4523320," Right."
4523320,4529720," And unfortunately, if I just open, uh, the C from scratch,"
4529720,4532600," it's still going to use that mode."
4532600,4534920," So I have to do something to disable all that."
4534920,4540920," Uh, oh, so he has, uh, use package by default."
4540920,4544520," I think I do have use package, but I don't understand the point of it."
4544520,4547240," Can anybody explain me what's the point of use package?"
4549720,4555800," So you specify a package and then to call in it like lazy loading."
4555800,4560600," Ah, simpc mode with SQL."
4560600,4560840," Yeah."
4560840,4561960," So let's actually try that."
4561960,4563000," Lazy load."
4563000,4563800," I don't understand that."
4563800,4566520," Just keep your configuration simple and you don't need lazy loading."
4570120,4571080," Uh, okay."
4571080,4573400," Just, just keep it simple."
4573400,4575080," Bruv, bruv, bruv."
4575080,4577160," I already removed the skillite shit."
4577160,4577480," Okay."
4577480,4580360," Got fucking damage."
4580360,4581560," Got fucking damage."
4581560,4583880," So rexim simpc mode."
4583880,4587960," I feel like I want to make a small break, honestly."
4587960,4588360," All right."
4588360,4590520," I need to make a cup of tea or something, but."
4590520,4593400," So amalgamated."
4593400,4595080," Amalgamated."
4595080,4596760," Double get."
4596760,4597720," I should have not removed it."
4597720,4598680," I don't know why I removed it."
4600760,4601720," So I'm going to open it up."
4601720,4604840," But it's going to take some time to open it because it uses that stupid mode."
4604840,4607240," I'm switching to simpc mode."
4607240,4607560," Right."
4607560,4609240," And I go to the end of the file."
4609240,4611640," And it goes to the end of the file right away."
4611640,4613080," So it's super fast."
4613080,4615960," And it looks pretty much similar to the c mode."
4615960,4618600," And it just looks pretty much similar."
4618600,4619320," It's just faster."
4619320,4621400," It's just simply faster."
4621400,4623960," It's not as featureful as c mode."
4623960,4627640," But honestly, it lacks the features that I personally don't use anyway."
4627640,4628840," So I don't care."
4629880,4630680," I don't fucking care."
4630680,4634440," It's kind of funny."
4634440,4635480," Anyway."
4635480,4642600," So the thing is, like, we need to instruct Emacs to use simpc mode when you open a c file."
4642600,4642920," Right."
4642920,4644200," You have to do that explicitly."
4644200,4645960," And I don't remember how to do that."
4645960,4647640," So I'm going to go and search for maybe."
4647640,4650440," Why am I using GitHub?"
4650440,4655000," Can anybody freaking explain me why I use GitHub to grab my files that I have locally?"
4657800,4660360," This goddamn big tech corporation."
4660360,4665800," They're debating you into relying on their infrastructure."
4665800,4668840," Even though you can actually do the same shit on your local computer."
4668840,4671320," Look at that."
4671320,4671960," Look at them."
4671960,4674920," And their search is, like, it's even worse than grep."
4677160,4678120," Tinfoil headphone."
4678120,4679080," Yeah, exactly."
4679080,4681720," It's even worse than grep."
4681720,4682920," Like, why the fuck am I doing that?"
4682920,4683560," I don't know."
4683560,4687240," So I can just go here.files and I can just do grep."
4687240,4695160," And by the way, grep is capable of outputting things in a compiler format, which means it"
4695160,4699080," integrates with the compile mode of Emacs right away."
4699080,4700600," Right fucking away."
4700600,4701880," So we can do simpc mode."
4701880,4703000," And as you can see, here we go."
4703000,4704280," So and this is the compilation mode."
4704280,4706040," This is the same compilation mode."
4706040,4709400," And the way I use simpc mode is just like I require it."
4709400,4710280," And I just add."
4710280,4714040," I just add this sort of like a configuration in here."
4714040,4714920," Okay, that's pretty cool."
4716920,4718200," I'm using the require."
4718200,4720840," So that means, yeah."
4720840,4723480," So I modify load path, right?"
4723480,4727480," Because require just loads the module, but it searches this in search path."
4727480,4729880," And first thing I do, I just add this to the search path."
4729880,4734360," Maybe this is something that I actually want to do for my new Emacs config, because it kind"
4734360,4735160," of makes sense, right?"
4735160,4741400," Instead of just loading it like that, I can just do this and then I can simply require simpc"
4741400,4743720," mode, right, simpc mode."
4743720,4749800," And after that, so it's Emacs from .files, simpc."
4749800,4754440," I basically add this regular expression."
4754440,4758200," So the file name will be matched against the regular expression."
4758200,4760600," And if it matches, it will enable simpc mode."
4760600,4765480," So this is how we, by default, use simpc mode for C files and stuff like that."
4765480,4767240," So I think it's, I think it's fair."
4767240,4768760," I think it's only fair to do that."
4769480,4770040," That's pretty cool."
4770040,4772440," That's pretty cool."
4772440,4773000," That's pretty cool."
4773000,4773560," That's pretty cool."
4773560,4776120," So now I evaluated that."
4776120,4779560," And if I open main.c, I'm in a simpc mode."
4779560,4780040," Look at that."
4780040,4781160," So it's a simpc mode."
4781160,4782200," So it's super fast."
4782200,4783720," We finally configured that."
4783720,4785720," I'm super fucking happy, mate."
4785720,4787560," Right."
4787560,4790120," So I'm a little bit struggling."
4790120,4794600," I'm a little bit struggling with my Emacs thingy, because as you can see,"
4794600,4797960," I don't have a proper outer completion of commands and stuff like that."
4797960,4802600," And as I already said, the thing that does this outer completion, this magical, magical thing,"
4802600,4804040," it is called IDO."
4804040,4805800," Right."
4805800,4808360," So I don't remember what it means, but it's called IDO."
4808360,4816440," And it comes with Emacs, but it's disabled by default, which is the biggest crime in the history of Emacs."
4817080,4821880," The fact that they don't show off this kind of feature right in your face, again,"
4821880,4823800," is the biggest crime in Emacs history."
4823800,4825400," Absolutely."
4825400,4826280," Right."
4826280,4831640," Because if it was like that by default, Emacs would have been way more popular."
4831640,4834360," Vim wouldn't be a thing even."
4835240,4836120," It wouldn't be a thing."
4836120,4837960," It's an interactive do."
4837960,4838280," Okay."
4838280,4838520," Okay."
4838520,4839640," So that's what it means, actually."
4839640,4840840," All right."
4840840,4845400," So you have to enable it by default and it's not convenient and it doesn't even work everywhere."
4845400,4846920," It's just like, it's so weird."
4846920,4848200," Like, I do not understand."
4848200,4851400," But anyway, so let's try to enable it."
4851400,4855640," Sometimes you even have to have like a separate packages to make it work properly and whatever."
4856760,4859720," So I think it should be like a default thing that just works like that."
4859720,4865320," So the first thing we do, we do idemode and we just enable it."
4865320,4865640," Right."
4865640,4868440," So, and I feel like it should have been just like that."
4868440,4868680," Right."
4868680,4871160," Just like enable this thing, idemode."
4871160,4872280," It's enabled."
4872280,4877160," And it doesn't work for Emacs, but it works for files now."
4877160,4882200," So as you can see now, I can just like navigate with files and whatever."
4882200,4885080," And it works, but it doesn't work for Emacs commands."
4885880,4886360," Right."
4886360,4889960," And I think there is idemode everywhere, which I don't know."
4889960,4894440," Is that a built-in thing or is that a separate package that I installed some time ago?"
4894440,4895320," I don't freaking know."
4895320,4897080," I actually don't freaking know."
4897080,4899720," And it's also, there is a smacks and stuff like that."
4899720,4904200," So let's actually search for idemode everywhere."
4904200,4904440," Yeah."
4904440,4905960," So idemode everywhere."
4905960,4909640," Token use of idemode for all buffer file reading."
4909640,4909960," Okay."
4909960,4912200," So let's actually enable it as well."
4914280,4917400," So it's going to be idemode everywhere."
4917400,4917720," One."
4917720,4921640," And it still doesn't work for Emacs."
4921640,4924360," So you have to enable this smacks thing."
4924360,4926360," Yeah."
4926360,4928600," Either complete plus."
4928600,4929560," Yeah."
4929560,4931000," So it's a separate package."
4931000,4933240," You really have to install it as a separate package."
4934360,4934680," Yeah."
4934680,4936520," So there is no smacks or anything."
4936520,4938520," Maybe there is a, yeah."
4938520,4943080," So to enable it for Emacs command, it has to be a separate package."
4943080,4946280," It has to be a separate package, which is sad."
4946280,4948200," But I mean, at least it works for files, right?"
4948200,4951800," So, and that's already makes it a little bit more easier to navigate and stuff like that."
4951800,4953560," And as you can see, it opens fast."
4953560,4960680," So we have 200,000 files and it opens super fast because I'm using SimC and stuff like that."
4960680,4964360," Either vertical, vertical."
4964360,4968200," It's not even by default."
4968200,4969800," So it's a separate package, unfortunately."
4970680,4971720," It looks like a separate package."
4971720,4975000," Also Firefox has telemetry garbage."
4975000,4977320," Did you forget to disable them in the settings?"
4977320,4977880," Probably."
4977880,4979320," I probably forgot to disable them."
4979320,4984040," So, all right."
4984040,4985400," I'm a little bit tired already."
4985400,4990680," So I think maybe it's time to make a small break and make a cup of tea."
4990680,4994520," And after the small break, we're going to continue, you know, configuring that."
4994520,4996760," Luckily, I think I'm almost done, right?"
4996760,5000920," Because, again, I don't really need super featureful config in here."
5000920,5009320," And, yeah, I think I can then, when I'm finished, I can improve it further as I go and as I try to use it."
5009320,5009640," All right."
5009640,5010360," Let's make some break it."
5010360,5013880," And I want to open."
5013880,5017080," Honestly, I'm not sure if I need SMEX."
5017080,5017640," Kind of."
5017640,5024120," Well, I mean, I do need SMEX because, you know, I like to, you know, start compilation with just COM."
5024120,5025000," All right."
5025000,5027480," So when it doesn't auto-complete it properly."
5027480,5028920," Right."
5028920,5034760," So the cool thing about IDO is that it also ranks command to the frequency of usage."
5034760,5035000," Right."
5035000,5040360," So it, if you use a certain command more frequently, it just brings it to the top."
5040360,5042760," So it makes it easier for you to type it."
5042760,5045480," So this is one of the, like, also killer feature of IDO."
5050120,5051160," It's like a pretty good tea."
5051160,5053800," It brewed really fucking well."
5053800,5054840," Like, how did I do that?"
5054840,5059080," I don't know."
5059080,5065320," I didn't even pre-warm to my vessel where I actually brew the tea."
5066360,5068280," One of the things that I quite like to do."
5068280,5068520," Right."
5068520,5073720," So I have a teapot where I brew the tea."
5073720,5080280," I like to pour a little bit of a hot water first there to sort of warm it up to bring to a certain temperature."
5080840,5082120," Then pour it off."
5082120,5084840," Then put the leaves and then pour the water again."
5084840,5089480," So it basically, the temperature of the water when I pour it doesn't drop suddenly."
5089480,5091160," And it actually brews it really, really well."
5091160,5095080," So I didn't do this pre-warm thing because I usually don't do it when I'm streaming."
5095080,5096520," So to save a little bit of a time."
5096520,5098120," And it still brews really well."
5098120,5099800," So I wonder what exactly did I do?"
5099800,5100680," I did that with coffee."
5100680,5100920," Yeah."
5100920,5103720," So it works pretty much with every, like anything."
5103720,5107560," Nice idea."
5107560,5107960," Yeah."
5107960,5110120," So, and it's not even like my idea."
5110120,5111400," So Chinese people do that."
5111400,5114040," I think Turkish people do that."
5114040,5117960," So it's in a culture of many tea drinking peoples."
5117960,5119080," Right."
5119080,5123720," So it's kind of a well-known trick throughout the centuries."
5123720,5124600," So people knew that."
5124600,5129080," So you first want to pre-warm your teaware and then brew there."
5129080,5135880," I wonder if a heated cup will brew tea even better."
5135880,5137480," Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe."
5137480,5141800," Will you share your config after this change?"
5141800,5143000," Yes, I will share the config."
5143000,5147880," This is so good."
5147880,5148600," Like what the fuck?"
5150600,5154040," Void Linux makes tea better."
5154040,5154680," Maybe, maybe."
5154680,5155640," I don't freaking know."
5155640,5156440," I don't freaking know."
5156440,5157720," God damn."
5157720,5158840," I don't want to stop drinking tea."
5158840,5159800," What the fuck?"
5159800,5160680," Where's the porn?"
5160680,5161000," Yeah."
5161000,5164920," This is one of the downsides of the, of the new setup."
5164920,5170840," There's no porn folder, but there is a wallpaper that you can't see."
5170840,5172840," So there's, yeah, this is kind of a problem."
5172840,5177480," Like I put it this, I put this wallpaper as a meme, but we can't really see it"
5177480,5178840," most of the time, unfortunately."
5178840,5181400," We just can't really see it most of the time."
5181400,5182680," So that's kind of the problem."
5182680,5184920," But I mean, we can see it at the beginning of the stream."
5184920,5189160," So it's kind of, it could be like a, like Andreas Kling style of meme."
5189160,5189560," I don't know."
5189560,5193480," So I'm stealing ideas from Andreas Kling."
5196280,5198040," It's a pretty good banger wallpaper."
5198040,5198840," I'm not going to lie."
5198840,5199400," I really like it."
5199400,5203400," Maybe use it in a terminal background."
5203400,5207160," I don't really like to use images in my terminals and stuff like that,"
5207160,5208360," because they're kind of distracting."
5208360,5210280," Right."
5210280,5213880," So, and when I'm looking at the terminal, I usually, I'm usually focused."
5213880,5214120," Right."
5214120,5217240," So I don't like things that distract me from actually focusing on anything."
5217240,5221240," Can you make the Emacs partially transparent?"
5221240,5223560," Yes, you can, but I'm not going to do that."
5223640,5227640," So Emacs has a transparency."
5227640,5233320," So remember how we talked about the, um, the properties of the frames."
5233320,5236760," So as far as I know, one of the properties of the frame is transparency."
5236760,5241000," You can actually control transparency of the frame through Emacs configuration,"
5241000,5241560," stuff like that."
5241560,5243400," So you can actually do that."
5243400,5249080," By the way, um, one of the important things that I forgot to mention"
5249080,5251800," in my configuration and stuff like that is the mechanism of"
5252360,5254040," RC slash require."
5254040,5261160," So, and it's kind of like a major mechanism, um, in the, um, in my config."
5261160,5263320," And it's a super cool one."
5263320,5265000," Let me actually demonstrate you."
5265000,5270520," So if I go somewhere here, so you may notice things like, uh, RC require."
5270520,5272440," I even have a RC require theme."
5272440,5273240," Right."
5273240,5274440," This one is also really interesting."
5274440,5275960," So I should have used that one."
5275960,5280280," So there's also RC require smx and either completion rate plus or whatever."
5280280,5284120," So smx adds i.2mx to the commands in here."
5284120,5285800," As you can see, I don't have ID in here."
5285800,5287000," Smex adds that thing."
5287000,5292120," So, and essentially what you do, you just like do RC require on the packages,"
5292120,5294840," but you do that on the packages that you don't have installed."
5296440,5303480," The main point of this entire thing is that RC require will look whether a package is installed."
5303480,5306120," And if it's not installed, first it's going to install it."
5306840,5311160," And then it's going to usually require it, basically load it."
5311160,5314040," So why would you do it like that?"
5314040,5320680," The main idea is that you take a new computer, you download the configuration,"
5320680,5327080," you sim link all of the config files, you open Emacs and Emacs just installs everything it needs."
5327080,5330280," All of these third party dependencies, all stuff like that through RC require."
5330280,5333720," And RC require does not install package if it's already installed."
5334840,5337080," So this was the idea."
5337080,5341880," And I don't know, like people use use package and stuff like that."
5341880,5344840," Does use package automatically installs things for you?"
5344840,5349480," So this is kind of like use package with less features, probably."
5349480,5349880," Yeah."
5349880,5353480," But what's interesting is that I developed this mechanism way before use package even existed."
5353480,5356200," Use package installs things automatically."
5356200,5360680," So, okay, maybe I should use use package then."
5360680,5362600," All right."
5363400,5368120," So can you install?"
5368120,5372200," I don't know."
5372200,5374440," Like I look to use package and it's kind of weird."
5374440,5376280," Like I don't understand it and stuff like that."
5376280,5378040," So I probably not going to use it."
5378040,5379560," I'm sorry, sorry, sorry."
5379560,5383240," So also in old config, I call package initialize."
5383240,5385240," I don't think it's needed anymore, honestly."
5385880,5390120," So is an auto loaded interactive."
5390120,5390440," Okay."
5390440,5392760," It's not standard to adjust load path."
5392760,5396440," So load Emacs list packages and activate them."
5397240,5399400," So I don't really know what's up with that."
5399400,5402440," So we can take a look at how this entire thing is implemented."
5402440,5404040," So it's in rc.l."
5404040,5406040," That's where it is."
5406040,5407960," So first of all, I just add melpa."
5407960,5410600," So that's one thing that is cool in here."
5410600,5412120," I just add melpa."
5412120,5418840," And here is the implementation of rc require."
5420120,5421640," So I can actually provide several packages."
5421640,5422840," This is kind of cool."
5422840,5426600," I iterate through the packages and then I call require one package."
5426600,5431880," Young me."
5431880,5435080," Honestly, these days I'm like, why would they create this?"
5435080,5437880," Okay."
5437880,5441000," So in here, I just call if package is installed, right?"
5441000,5446200," If package is installed, I just refresh contents once."
5446200,5462680," So I suppose this package, this function, it's a mix between function and package."
5471960,5479800," So this function just downloads the latest list of packages, right?"
5479800,5483000," So they are refreshed and stuff like that, but it does it only once, right?"
5483000,5483800," So it does it only once."
5483800,5487240," So it's not refreshed on each package required."
5487240,5491240," So we just refresh this list and we do package install, right?"
5491240,5497080," As you can see, there was a lot of experimentation that went into this package manager, right?"
5497080,5503080," So because like you really need to refresh the content because at the beginning, it's not like it's not refreshed."
5503080,5505560," It's not fetched from melpa, for instance."
5505560,5507480," So it may not work right away."
5507480,5510840," And I also have a thing called require theme, right?"
5510840,5516600," So it is needed for requiring and enabling and loading themes simultaneously."
5516600,5520760," I even, holy shit, I'm using this arrow thingy, right?"
5520760,5525560," Which is probably part of the Emacs now, right?"
5525560,5527640," So it's a threading apparatus from Clojure."
5527640,5530200," Do we have any Clojure developers in the chat?"
5530200,5536120," Aren't you hyped up that we're using Clojure feature in Emacs Lisp, right?"
5536120,5537160," So that's what we're doing."
5537160,5541960," So as far as now, I don't remember what this thing does, but I think what this thing does."
5543000,5547560," So maybe I'm going to enable Emacs Lisp mode, right?"
5547560,5554040," So it takes the first argument and puts it as the last argument to the expression."
5554040,5560360," So essentially it takes this and puts it in here, right?"
5560360,5567000," Then it takes this and puts it in here like this."
5567000,5569720," Then it takes this and puts it in here."
5569720,5573560," So that's what this macro does."
5573560,5578600," It basically threads a value through a sequence of expressions like that."
5578600,5581000," Right, that's what it is."
5581000,5586360," So, and it was invented by Clojure, as far as I know, initially."
5586360,5592120," It was invented by Clojure and it's super convenient because it just like feels very functional-ish, right?"
5592120,5596280," So we have initial value and you just thread it through a sequence of expressions."
5596280,5597480," And it's really easy to read, right?"
5597480,5598360," You read the sequence."
5598360,5601240," So it's pretty cool."
5601240,5604680," So, and basically here we just construct the theme package, right?"
5604680,5607960," So honestly, I'm just formatting a string in here."
5607960,5609960," So it's kind of weird why I did like that."
5609960,5616680," Oh, I use in turn, which turns, I suppose, a string into a symbol."
5616680,5617240," So that's why."
5617240,5621160," So I need you to construct the symbol so that then I can require that symbol."
5621160,5624280," And then I can load the theme, right?"
5624280,5625880," And also in here, I use Dash."
5625880,5630200," But I'm not sure, is Dash now a part of Emacs?"
5630200,5632360," I think it's already part of the Emacs, isn't it?"
5632360,5635400," ""Fungchi Summoned""."
5635400,5635800," Yeah, yeah."
5635800,5637800," ""Fungchi is the biggest Clojure fund""."
5637800,5642680," So if I require Dash, is it already available?"
5642680,5644120," Right."
5644120,5647000," So, but can I thread things like this?"
5647000,5651560," Can I do like 34 and can I thread this through 35?"
5651560,5653480," I can't."
5653480,5655240," That is bizarre."
5655240,5657720," So, and Dash."
5657720,5659880," Let's take a look at the Dash actually."
5659880,5661160," So I'm going to do list packages."
5661160,5664440," I'm really curious about the Dash."
5664440,5669000," I didn't see shit."
5669000,5669800," Okay, here it is."
5669800,5673320," So, is it still supported, I wonder?"
5673320,5674680," Requires Emacs 24."
5674680,5676440," Emacs 24 again."
5676440,5679480," So, two arrows."
5679480,5681720," But I mean, there's also a variant with a single error."
5681720,5685000," It's just like the error defines where exactly the argument is threaded."
5685000,5687000," On which argument it is threaded."
5687000,5693640," Oh, I forgot that it was created by Bronis, but yeah."
5693640,5695400," That's why it's called Dash."
5695400,5697560," So, is it still supported?"
5697560,5700760," Four months ago."
5700760,5701960," So, I think it is."
5701960,5703000," I think it's still supported."
5703000,5706760," So, it was actually almost 10 years ago and I think"
5706760,5711560," MLP was a big thing at the time of this thing was created."
5711720,5712680," I think it was."
5712680,5714520," No CL required."
5714520,5717400," CL is a package that brings common disp to Emacs."
5717400,5718280," Let's try as I know."
5718280,5719640," So, anyway."
5719640,5722920," So, it's probably one of the things we want to do in here."
5722920,5728440," So, yes, yes, yes."
5728440,5733480," Funnily enough, require theme uses Dash."
5733480,5734840," Right."
5734840,5738840," But then it uses require, RC require to install Dash."
5738840,5740760," That's very interesting."
5740760,5744280," So, since it's a dynamic language, it doesn't create any errors in here."
5744280,5745480," Yeah."
5745480,5746440," So, this is kind of funny."
5746440,5748120," So, there's also Dash functional."
5748120,5749800," So, this is additional thing in here."
5749800,5753240," This is an additional thing in here."
5753240,5755720," Kind of interesting."
5755720,5756840," Kind of interesting."
5756840,5768280," So, I suppose, since this RC.l is part of the Emacs.rc folder, it only makes sense for me to"
5768280,5775160," sim link Emacs.rc so I can use this RC package manager."
5775160,5780520," So, I suppose I'm okay with reusing this entire thing in here because it's kind of useful."
5780520,5781640," It's very minimal."
5781640,5783560," It's only 34 lines of code."
5783560,5785560," How big is your use package?"
5785560,5787560," How big is it?"
5788360,5790200," I think it's way bigger than 34."
5790200,5791400," Right."
5791400,5796760," So, yes, yes, yes, yes."
5796760,5802920," What I want you to do, I want you to go to manifest Linux."
5802920,5803080," Right."
5803080,5804360," So, I already did that."
5804360,5811000," And I'm going to simply call deploy.sh."
5811000,5812760," All right."
5812760,5814760," Did it sim link this entire thing?"
5814760,5815640," I think it did."
5815640,5821080," So, we can go to here and let's find Emacs.rc."
5821080,5821400," Okay."
5821400,5825880," So, how did I do some stuff?"
5825880,5828360," So, Emacs like this."
5828360,5830600," Yeah."
5830600,5834200," I suppose I just loaded it, if I'm not mistaken, right?"
5834600,5835880," I simply loaded it."
5835880,5843160," So, I just do load file Emacs.rc.l."
5843160,5844280," There we go."
5844280,5845880," So, that's what I did here."
5845880,5847880," So, rc.l."
5847880,5850280," And then I just do custom."
5850280,5851320," Right."
5851320,5855320," So, I'm installing Gruber Darker and I'm enabling it like that."
5855320,5862680," But what I think I want to do is actually use rc require theme."
5862680,5863400," Right."
5863400,5864120," That's what I want to do."
5864120,5865320," So, let's remove that."
5865320,5867240," So, this is the save theme."
5867240,5868600," Maybe I'm going to actually keep it."
5868600,5868840," Right."
5868840,5870040," I'm going to keep it just in case."
5870040,5874040," And package selected packages like this."
5874040,5878200," I'm going to keep these parameters in here, but I'm going to keep that stuff like that."
5878200,5879800," Right."
5879800,5891640," And I suppose now what I can do, I can do rc require gruber darker, like so."
5891640,5894280," I think this is going to work."
5895000,5897720," So, if I now exit Emacs and I just bring it back."
5897720,5903000," It's contacting non-gnu alpha, it's just refreshing all of the things."
5903000,5903640," Right."
5903640,5909640," So, since we added alpha, it's taking some time."
5909640,5911480," gruber darker is not available."
5911480,5914600," That is very interesting."
5914600,5916760," So, why is it not available?"
5916760,5918680," Is that because I'm just using it incorrectly?"
5918680,5919160," Probably."
5919800,5922440," gruber darker."
5922440,5927640," GitHub is so annoying."
5927640,5929640," Yeah."
5929640,5931080," So, it didn't work."
5935640,5936600," it's theme."
5936600,5937880," I know that."
5937880,5939160," I fucking know that."
5939160,5943720," And that's why I add theme in here at the end."
5943720,5947560," I freaking know that."
5947560,5948280," Don't tell me that."
5948280,5950680," Think I don't know what the fuck I'm doing?"
5950680,5952040," You think I don't know what the fuck I'm doing?"
5952040,5953720," I know what the fuck I'm doing."
5953720,5953960," Okay."
5953960,5958280," So, yeah, that's bizarre."
5958280,5960920," Like, I don't understand why it wouldn't work like that, but okay."
5960920,5963080," So, let's just try to do it like that."
5963800,5970840," So, and to ensure no, it's still the end of file parsing."
5970840,5972280," Oh, I broke everything."
5972280,5973480," God fucking damn it."
5973480,5976840," I broke fucking everything with this chest."
5976840,5978360," So, what you don't like?"
5978360,5978760," Tell me."
5978760,5979640," Tell me what you don't like."
5979640,5981080," So, what's wrong in here?"
5981080,5982680," It's a fine config."
5982680,5984440," Damn, bruh."
5984440,5987640," Just edit one thing and it fucking broke everything."
5987640,5989720," All right."
5989720,5991160," Can I just not load it then?"
5993320,5994520," Bro, what the fuck do you need?"
5994520,5995960," And I record while loading it."
5995960,5997640," Okay, so let's do debugging it then."
5997640,5999160," Okay."
5999160,6001880," Debug init."
6001880,6003400," So annoying."
6003400,6009880," While loading."
6009880,6013720," Maybe I have to do that debug init."
6013720,6017400," It doesn't even give me shit."
6018040,6024920," So, to ensure no operation, you should investigate and remove the cause set with debug init option to view complete error logs."
6024920,6027800," Line."
6027800,6028760," Where do you see that?"
6028760,6031240," Is that a warnings or something?"
6031240,6032600," Like, is that messages?"
6032600,6034360," I don't see that."
6034360,6038360," Where did you see line extra parent?"
6038360,6039320," Or is it?"
6039320,6040120," Did you do that?"
6040120,6042920," Where is the line extra parent?"
6042920,6043960," Like, why doesn't it?"
6043960,6047320," So, the problem is not what I did wrong or not."
6047320,6048840," Why emacs doesn't tell me that?"
6048840,6049880," Right."
6049880,6052760," Where is the extra line?"
6052760,6053800," Why didn't I see that?"
6053800,6055560," 18."
6055560,6057240," Is that extra line?"
6057240,6058600," No, there's no extra line in here."
6058600,6059560," Everything's fine."
6059560,6062600," So, why are you debating me?"
6062600,6067720," There's no extra line in here."
6067720,6068760," There's no extra line in here."
6068760,6070040," There's no extra line in here."
6070040,6071240," There's no extra line in here."
6071240,6071560," Wait."
6071560,6073320," Ah."
6073320,6074360," Okay, Jesus."
6074360,6075240," But it's not 18."
6075240,6078200," People!"
6078200,6080120," Don't waste my time!"
6080120,6082920," Okay, so..."
6082920,6084040," Ooh, this is annoying."
6084040,6086520," Right."
6089080,6091160," I tried to do Ctrl+F and it's..."
6091160,6095560," It's a thing that starts up file manager in Xfce."
6095560,6102760," Xfce is kind of cool, in a sense."
6102760,6105960," But it has some annoying default things."
6105960,6108920," It's kind of yikes, honestly."
6108920,6109800," But, I mean, that's fine."
6109800,6111880," Okay."
6111880,6114120," So, now it should work, hopefully."
6114120,6116440," Yeah, now everything worked."
6116440,6118120," But we lost GruberDarker."
6118120,6121320," I really want to use RCRequire for this entire thing."
6121320,6121480," Okay."
6121480,6122840," So, I'm going to enable RCRequire."
6122840,6130440," So, I suppose all of the thing got derailed because of that extra, you know, forgotten parenthesis."
6130440,6130760," Right."
6130760,6133960," So, the entire thing got derailed because of that."
6133960,6136600," So, and everything kind of worked anyway."
6136600,6136840," All right."
6136840,6142680," So, RCRequire, GruberDarker, and I can do something like that."
6142680,6146520," So, I do that and it automatically installs this thing, hopefully."
6146520,6148440," And it will enable it as well, hopefully."
6148440,6149800," All right."
6149800,6151560," It didn't."
6151560,6152760," GruberDarker is not available."
6152760,6155800," This is not true, by the way."
6156440,6157960," So, let me, let me see."
6157960,6159880," Oh, RCRequire theme."
6159880,6161480," Okay."
6161480,6162120," And now it will work."
6162120,6162840," Okay."
6162840,6163240," That's cool."
6163240,6165720," So, yeah."
6165720,6169800," GruberDarker is a separate package."
6169800,6170920," It's a separate package."
6170920,6175880," I'm going to remove emacs.d."
6175880,6179720," So, this is where emacs actually keeps all of its packages."
6179720,6179960," Right."
6179960,6181240," So, here's elpa."
6181240,6182120," I can go there."
6182120,6183800," And here are all the installed packages."
6183800,6184440," Here's the dash."
6184440,6185720," Here's the dash functional."
6185720,6188680," GruberDarker 0.7 and so on and so forth."
6188680,6190600," Here are all the packages installed."
6190600,6193720," I'm going to remove emacs.d."
6193720,6195160," Right."
6195160,6197000," And I'm going to start emacs for the first time."
6197000,6198920," So, there's no GruberDarker installed."
6198920,6199240," Nothing."
6199240,6200520," Nothing is installed."
6200520,6201320," Right."
6201320,6202920," And, yeah."
6202920,6203480," It didn't work."
6203480,6205400," Okay."
6205400,6207320," So, but this is exactly why we're stringed."
6207320,6207480," Right."
6207480,6208760," So, we're trying to figure out."
6208760,6212040," I think what we need to do is package initialize."
6212040,6212200," Right."
6212200,6215160," So, because here, as you can see, I do package initialize."
6215160,6219880," So, I feel like at the beginning, packages are not initialized."
6219880,6221080," Packages are not initialized."
6221080,6223320," So, I'm going to remove emacs.d one more time."
6223320,6225400," And I'm going to bring..."
6225400,6225960," There we go."
6225960,6228120," So, you need to do package initialize first."
6228760,6230840," So, it's going to take some time."
6230840,6231080," Right."
6231080,6232360," It's refreshing the packages."
6232360,6233800," It's loading them."
6233800,6235320," And it's going to be installing them."
6235320,6237400," So, the idea of the whole thing was that..."
6237400,6238280," Yeah."
6238280,6241320," And it basically installed GruberDarker and it configured everything."
6242280,6247160," So, you don't have to install anything manually like we did at the beginning of the stream."
6247160,6252440," But just open emacs and it will download everything and configure everything."
6252440,6253960," It's just like everything's fine."
6253960,6256520," So, that was the idea of rc/require."
6256520,6258760," Is really use package like that?"
6258760,6262440," Because I don't remember use package actually installing things."
6262440,6263960," Emacs use package."
6264760,6267880," I think use package worked on already installed things."
6267880,6269240," Right."
6269240,6271800," Macro allows you to set a package customization."
6271800,6276200," So, install."
6276200,6280040," So, know that this package is not the package manager."
6280040,6285480," All the use package does have the useful capability to interface with emacs package manager."
6285480,6290200," Its primary purpose is help with configuration and loading packages, not with managing their download,"
6290200,6291320," upgrading installation."
6291320,6293720," Ensure."
6293720,6294280," Okay."
6294280,6295800," So, this is cool."
6295800,6296520," This is interesting."
6296520,6297160," So, let me see."
6297160,6298840," Use package."
6298840,6301320," Ensure."
6301320,6305160," Load the package using package.l if necessary."
6305160,6306520," All right."
6306520,6309320," But it also has these additional things that you need to learn."
6309320,6314520," My problem with use package is that you have to learn it."
6314520,6318520," It has this like hand-holding API and stuff like that."
6318520,6319880," Like, I don't want to be doing that."
6320440,6322920," I just want to require a package and be done with it."
6322920,6323960," Right."
6323960,6325160," So, I really don't like that."
6325160,6326440," Right."
6326440,6327960," So, that I have to learn all these things."
6327960,6331000," Like, I used emacs before use package and it was fine."
6331000,6333000," Like, now why do I have to learn all that stuff?"
6333000,6333480," No."
6333480,6334760," Not going to be doing that."
6334760,6342600," With rc require, it's so simple that it works like require, but it just also installs the package."
6342600,6346760," So, if you already know how to use this kind of thing, like, you don't have to learn a new thing."
6346760,6346920," Right."
6348360,6349800," So, it doesn't make sense for me."
6349800,6352520," Like, why do we have these additional moving parts in here?"
6352520,6355720," What I want is just like to install it automatically."
6355720,6356280," And that's it."
6356280,6359240," So, I can do the rest of the stuff myself."
6359240,6364280," So, as somebody said, use package is probably when you want to have lazy loading."
6364280,6368600," But the reason why you want to have lazy loading is because your configuration is complex."
6368600,6368760," Right."
6368760,6370360," So, it's kind of like a self-imposed problem."
6370360,6373960," And maybe for some people it is necessary."
6373960,6374920," I do recognize that."
6374920,6377240," But it's not a problem for me."
6377240,6378840," So, I kind of don't care."
6378840,6381480," I kind of don't care."
6381480,6384520," So, here we do sim sim mod."
6384520,6388920," And maybe somewhere here I want to do something like rc require smex."
6388920,6389800," Right."
6389800,6390920," So, let's just install."
6390920,6395800," And what's cool is that with rc require I can just do that."
6396920,6400520," I can just like rc require and install it within the current session."
6400520,6404360," So, one thing I want to do."
6404360,6410600," So, rexium.files.emax smex."
6410600,6410840," Right."
6410840,6411720," So, we install it."
6411720,6414280," But I think, yeah, we also have to configure it in a certain way."
6414280,6419800," So, because when you do mx, it still doesn't use smex by default."
6419800,6420040," Right."
6420040,6421560," So, we have to do that."
6421560,6427480," But then, you also need to bring a backup to the original one just in case."
6427480,6427720," Right."
6427720,6429880," So, let me do that."
6429880,6433000," Now, if I do that, I finally have smex in here."
6433000,6435800," But on top of that, it does warnings."
6435800,6439560," Lambda quoted with rather..."
6439560,6442360," How do I disable these warnings?"
6442360,6443240," Does anybody know?"
6443240,6445480," Can I like..."
6445480,6445720," Okay."
6445720,6449240," So, that's kind of bizarre."
6449240,6450600," But, I mean, it works now."
6450600,6452200," And this thing works as well."
6452200,6453320," So, everything..."
6453320,6454040," It already..."
6454040,6456200," This already feels like my original config."
6456200,6457640," I can already work with this stuff."
6457640,6459480," Yeah."
6459480,6461080," I can already use the CMAX thingy."
6461080,6465080," Though, I think one thing I lack is multiple cursor support."
6465080,6468360," I think I lack multiple cursors."
6468360,6469320," MC."
6469320,6469560," Yeah."
6469560,6472440," Hmm."
6472440,6476760," This config is already turning into whatever I had."
6476760,6478280," Hmm."
6479880,6480840," It's kind of bizarre."
6480840,6484200," So, I'm going to put this stuff in here."
6484200,6486520," And I'm going to evaluate multiple cursors."
6486520,6489000," That will install multiple cursors automatically."
6489000,6494680," And we may want to bind some of the functions in here."
6494680,6500680," And now, I can have multiple cursors."
6502600,6504920," You see how easy it is with the rc/require?"
6504920,6506760," Right."
6506760,6513960," And if I need to bring this config to the new machine, it will just set it up everything automatically."
6513960,6515400," Set Q."
6515400,6517240," Set Q."
6517240,6518680," Warning minimum level error."
6518680,6518920," Okay."
6518920,6519880," So, let me try to do that."
6519880,6523400," So, customize a variable."
6523400,6525800," Warning."
6525800,6528680," Minimum level."
6528680,6530440," Aha."
6530440,6532040," Value."
6532040,6534120," I suppose error."
6534120,6535240," Right."
6535240,6537720," So, let's actually put it to error and let's actually save it."
6537720,6541160," And I suppose custom will go to here."
6541160,6542600," Warning."
6542600,6542840," Okay."
6542840,6543160," That's cool."
6543160,6543400," Thank you."
6543400,6543960," Thank you so much."
6543960,6544280," Thank you."
6544280,6544440," Thank you."
6544440,6544680," Thank you."
6544680,6545720," I really appreciate it."
6545720,6547160," So, now we have multiple errors."
6547160,6554520," So, another thing that I have in here is that Emacs by default doesn't have a convenient duplicate line."
6555320,6558440," which you may think is a common W of Veeam."
6558440,6562200," No, Emacs can't even duplicate line."
6562200,6566120," Like, does anybody know what's the official way of duplicating a line in Emacs?"
6566120,6569320," Do we have any professional Emacs developers in here or Emacs users?"
6569320,6571320," What's the official way to do that?"
6571320,6572760," Does anybody know?"
6572760,6575880," Rc/require seems good enough."
6575880,6577400," We'll try that out soon."
6577400,6577640," Yeah."
6577640,6579080," I think you should try that out."
6579080,6579320," Right."
6579320,6580520," So, it's very cool."
6580520,6581400," Control C, control V."
6581400,6581880," Yeah, I see."
6581880,6584120," It's very sad."
6584840,6585160," Right."
6585160,6585640," So, you do."
6585640,6588280," You can go to the beginning of the line."
6588280,6592600," Control K, control slash to bring it back."
6592600,6594600," Go down and insert it."
6594600,6596520," Which is disgusting."
6596520,6597320," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
6597320,6598760," Control A, control K, control."
6598760,6599400," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
6599400,6600200," It's just like."
6600200,6603880," It's just, it's goddamn fucking annoying."
6603880,6607160," Because, like, if you do that in Veeam, for instance."
6607160,6607400," Right."
6607400,6611400," So, in Veeam, common Veeam W as zoomers say."
6611400,6614360," So, you just do W."
6614360,6625400," So, let me actually remove that."
6625400,6626200," And yeah."
6626200,6634040," So, because of that, because of that, I developed my own function for cloning lines in Emacs."
6634520,6635080," So, let's take a look at it."
6635080,6635640," So, let's take a look at it."
6635640,6639640," It's in the, in old config somewhere."
6639640,6641080," I wonder where is it?"
6641080,6642120," I think it's somewhere."
6642120,6646600," Or C, misc, duplicate."
6646600,6647960," Yeah, here it is."
6647960,6649880," Duplicate line."
6649880,6653320," So, essentially what I did, I automated the thing."
6653320,6656200," I automated the thing with Emacs Lisp."
6656200,6658360," So, this is the function that duplicates line."
6658360,6662920," And then I bound this thing to control comma."
6663640,6664440," So, that's what I did."
6664440,6667320," And let me actually put that in here."
6667320,6670120," So, we are here."
6670120,6670600," There we go."
6670600,6672280," So, I'm going to put it in here."
6673480,6676120," And let me, for fuck's sake."
6676120,6676360," Okay."
6676360,6678200," XFC."
6678200,6679640," I'm going to evaluate that."
6679640,6680520," I'm going to evaluate that."
6680520,6686040," Now, when I want to duplicate line, I can press control comma and just duplicate it."
6686600,6687480," And you know what's funny?"
6687480,6689000," It's a single keystroke."
6689000,6690760," It's a single keystroke."
6690760,6698680," How many keystrokes you need to do in Vim?"
6698680,6703080," Where is your fucking W now?"
6703080,6704920," How many keystrokes you need to do in Vim?"
6704920,6707000," One, one."
6707000,6709560," Three keystrokes."
6709560,6711080," Three fucking keystrokes."
6711080,6711240," Okay."
6711240,6713400," So, we can actually optimize it to one."
6713400,6713720," Okay."
6713720,6715080," So, two keystrokes."
6715640,6716520," Freaking two key."
6716520,6719960," Where is UW now?"
6719960,6727560," And furthermore, let me show you a pretty cool use case that your WP doesn't even fucking cover."
6727560,6729720," Let me show you something."
6729720,6730360," Let me show you."
6730360,6733320," Let me teach you how to do actual text editing."
6733320,6734760," Look at that."
6734760,6738120," Imagine you're writing in a proper programming language like C."
6738120,6739320," In a real programming language."
6739320,6741000," Not a toy JavaScript."
6741000,6741400," Right."
6741400,6743400," So, and you include some files."
6743400,6744120," Right."
6744120,6745320," STD edge."
6745320,6747320," So, one of the things you want to do."
6747320,6749960," You want to duplicate a line."
6749960,6750280," Right."
6750280,6751160," And you duplicate it."
6751160,6757080," And look how cursor stays at the same place as it was originally on original line."
6758360,6762920," So, now the only thing you need to do is delete a word and put a new word."
6762920,6764760," Then you can duplicate again."
6764760,6766520," Again."
6766520,6768520," And it's super convenient."
6768520,6771480," Because the cursor stays on the same column."
6771480,6779960," Can your Vim do that with a single key fucking stroke?"
6779960,6780440," Bruv."
6780440,6781160," Bruv."
6781160,6782920," With a single key stroke."
6782920,6784520," Let's actually try it."
6784520,6785640," Let's actually try it."
6785640,6787880," Let's actually try it."
6787880,6788120," Okay."
6788120,6791240," What the fuck is that?"
6791240,6792680," What the fuck is that?"
6796680,6797560," fucking destroy."
6797560,6801720," So, does anybody know how you can do the same thing in Vim, by the way?"
6801720,6803080," Because sometimes I need to use Vim."
6803080,6804520," Right."
6804520,6810760," So, is there any convenient way to duplicate a line and also keep the cursor on the same column?"
6813560,6814600," Oh, there is a duplicate."
6814600,6816360," Duplicate."
6816360,6817160," Oh."
6817160,6818760," Oh, okay."
6818760,6820920," Duplicate a line."
6820920,6824440," Ooh."
6824440,6827080," Oh, this is actually kind of cool."
6827080,6836840," That looks weirdly familiar."
6836840,6840600," Anyways."
6841480,6844040," So, okay."
6844040,6846120," Well, I mean, jump into the..."
6846120,6849400," All of that adds extra keywords."
6849400,6851080," All of that."
6851080,6851400," Okay."
6851400,6852600," So, capital P."
6852600,6854120," Capital P sounds interesting, actually."
6854120,6854760," Just a second."
6854760,6858520," Capital P."
6858520,6863160," So, if I just do something like that."
6863160,6864360," STD.IO."
6864360,6865080," Capital Y."
6865080,6865720," Capital P."
6865720,6868920," No, capital P doesn't do shit, brother."
6868920,6869720," No."
6871080,6873000," None of that solves anything."
6873000,6874600," This is L."
6874600,6876360," This is a straight up fucking L."
6876360,6880280," Nobody managed to redeem Vim in the comments."
6880280,6882440," Nobody freaking managed to redeem it."
6882440,6883560," It's straight up L."
6883560,6884840," I'm sorry to tell you that."
6884840,6887720," I don't make the rules, but it's just straight up L."
6888440,6889400," Place above the..."
6889400,6890040," Yeah, exactly."
6890040,6893000," So, it is what it is."
6893000,6893800," Emacs won."
6893800,6895240," Emacs just won."
6895240,6900200," But in all seriousness, I think there should be a thing in Vim to do that."
6900200,6901320," Because it's rather convenient, right?"
6901320,6903240," So, to keep the cursor in the column."
6905080,6906040," So, yeah."
6906040,6908920," I can write some L.O. to do that."
6908920,6914760," But in Emacs, this comes out of the box."
6914760,6916840," Ha, ha, ha."
6916840,6919000," Emacs keeps winning."
6919000,6920440," Emacs keeps winning."
6921000,6922120," Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho."
6922120,6923320," Anyways."
6923320,6924520," It's pretty cool."
6924520,6928120," So, and this is how I develop my config."
6928120,6928760," My config."
6928760,6929720," Config, config."
6929720,6931880," I don't know how to pronounce it, right?"
6931880,6935400," So, people keep asking me how you configure Emacs like that."
6935400,6937080," I just demonstrated you, right?"
6937080,6942280," So, and after writing this config for a little bit, I feel like I'm going to end up with the same"
6942280,6943320," config as I had before."
6944040,6947320," So, I just need to figure out what the fuck is broken in my old config then."
6947320,6951480," Because pretty much like I'm just copy pasting from my old config."
6951480,6956200," So, I guess that's everything I need actually."
6956200,6958040," So, I don't know."
6958040,6962920," Maybe what I should have done instead, I should have actually just removed stuff from my older config"
6962920,6963960," instead of writing a new one."
6963960,6965960," Because I pretty much end up with the same thing."
6965960,6968760," So, curly brace somewhere."
6968760,6970760," Yeah, maybe I forgot curly brace somewhere."
6970760,6974600," Maybe it tries to install some packages that doesn't exist anymore or something like that."
6974600,6977480," But I think this stream was a pretty good"
6977480,6980920," walkthrough through my configuration."
6980920,6983320," Not really like walkthrough through in that configuration,"
6983320,6989000," but at least overview of how my configuration works and how I configure my Emacs, right?"
6989000,6993800," So, right now you know how to do a similar thing in Emacs."
6993800,6995160," As you can see, it's pretty straightforward."
6995160,6996200," It's pretty simple."
6996200,6997960," And I also learned a bunch of new things, right?"
6997960,7001000," So, you guys taught me about like separate customizable file, right?"
7001000,7003480," So, which is something that I needed for quite some time because"
7003480,7007880," I absolutely despised how Emacs just modifies my config and it's like annoying."
7007880,7011720," So, Emacs also has a copy from above command."
7011720,7013320," No, I've never heard about it."
7013320,7017960," So, copy from..."
7020600,7021320," Holy sh..."
7021320,7026280," This is a fucking game changer."
7026280,7028760," Is it bound to anything?"
7028760,7030280," Is it fucking bound to anything?"
7030280,7032360," Oh my god."
7032360,7035240," So, that means I can just do that."
7035240,7037800," Oh my..."
7037800,7041560," Yeah, so you can just take this part from the above command and just like copy it and..."
7041560,7043640," Damn, bro."
7044840,7046840," I'm gonna sneeze because it's so..."
7046840,7050520," That's how fucking cool it is."
7050520,7051880," It makes me sneeze."
7051880,7052600," Holy sh..."
7052600,7053640," Thank you."
7053640,7054600," I'll look into that."
7054600,7057160," I'll look how to integrate that into my workflow."
7057160,7059240," Thank you."
7059240,7059480," Thank you."
7059480,7059640," Thank you."
7059640,7059960," Thank you."
7059960,7061720," Okay."
7061720,7063640," I guess that was the fun stream."
7063640,7063800," Right."
7063800,7065720," So, I'm already streaming for two and a half of an hour."
7065720,7066200," So, I think..."
7066200,7068760," I think that's enough for today, everyone."
7068760,7070360," I think that's enough for today."
7070360,7072840," So, we've got some subs and beats."
7072840,7075400," Do..."
7075400,7076760," Okay."
7076760,7077000," Okay."
7077000,7077720," Listen, listen."
7077720,7081080," Do not give me a thousand beats."
7081080,7090200," Because of the sanctions imposed to my country, I don't get anything from that and probably will never get anything."
7090200,7093960," Considering the current situation in the world, I'm probably not gonna get."
7093960,7095800," You just wasted 100 bucks."
7095800,7098200," I'm not even joking."
7098200,7099880," You just wasted 100 bucks."
7099880,7106040," If you want to say something to me in this window, just do that with handed beats."
7106040,7108920," Please don't waste a thousand."
7108920,7109960," I don't get anything."
7109960,7112280," You just gave some money to Jeffrey Bezos."
7112280,7118200," Anyway, but I appreciate your gesture."
7118200,7118440," Right."
7118440,7123000," So, I know that you had like a good intents, but I just don't get that money anyway."
7123000,7124440," So, okay."
7124440,7124680," Hi."
7124680,7125880," I really enjoy your videos."
7125880,7128440," Every time I watch, I want to come back to use i3."
7128440,7134280," Unfortunately, I can't solve the multi DPI in my monitor and my laptop at my work."
7134280,7141560," I hope you keep making this video and I hope you raise the font like that."
7142760,7144840," I don't really know what you're talking about."
7144840,7146520," I don't really have a high DPI monitor."
7146520,7148040," So, I don't have this kind of problem."
7148040,7148760," But yeah."
7148760,7149160," Thank you."
7149160,7150440," Thank you for the gesture."
7150440,7150600," Right."
7150600,7153720," So, I didn't get this money anyway, but I appreciate the gesture."
7153720,7155560," So, thank you so much for the subreg, Glocks."
7155560,7159080," And thank you so much, Hanukkah Max, for tier 1 subscription."
7159080,7168120," So, and if you're wondering why I accept subscriptions, I purely use them as a ways of moderating my Discord server."
7168120,7168520," Right."
7168520,7179480," Even though I don't get anything from the subscriptions, just making people pay at least five dollars to get into the Discord makes the whole thing much more manageable."
7179480,7183160," So, I have to spend less time moderating the server."
7183160,7184760," So, that's literally why I do that."
7184760,7188360," I don't get any money, but it's a good moderation tool, so to speak."
7189080,7190280," It's a good moderation tool."
7190280,7191880," So, anyway."
7191880,7193320," I guess that's it for today."
7193320,7195720," Thanks everyone who's watching me right now."
7195720,7197000," I really appreciate it."
7197000,7197720," Have a good one."
7197720,7202680," And I'll see you all on next recreational programming session with a Mr. Azuzin."
7202680,7204200," Let me add an end scene."
7204200,7208360," Love you all."
