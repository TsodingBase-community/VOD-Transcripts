0,7200," Hello everyone and welcome to another totting session. How about that?"
7200,10320," How about that? But you didn't expect that shit to happen today."
10320,16740," Well, I mean, I'm doing the Monday session, but since it's a late night, it's already Tuesday,"
16740,24600," but it's like 1:00 a.m. right now. Almost 1:00 a.m. 46 minutes, actually, to be precise,"
24600,32640," if you're interested in that preciseness. So, and on the Monday session, we are doing web development."
32640,40680," Specifically, I allocated this slot for developing Emote Jam, which is basically a simple website that"
40680,46320," generates animated BDTV emotes from static images. So let me actually put that in the description,"
46320,59520," you know, as usual, as usual. So let me see, it's going to be Emote Jam. So, and on the previous stream,"
59520,66960," we started to do, started to develop a very simple front-end framework for this, for this website."
66960,74960," So the framework is called Gretcher.js. You can check it out here, of course, Gretcher.js. So it's going to be"
74960,81200," in the description, if you're interested in this thing. I also factor it a little bit. So yeah,"
81200,88800," the whole framework now is around 65 lines of code."
88800,96480," Yeah. So it's actually on the previous stream, we developed more, but then I compressed everything."
96480,103040," So I basically extracted a list of mundane tags and I basically crunched them and automatically generated"
103040,109680," their implementations, right? For such tags as h1, h2, h3, p, a, div, span, and maybe even more."
109680,115840," We're going to add more mundane tags in there. You can quite easily just automatically implement them."
115840,121840," Right. So that comprise the whole framework to 65 lines, but it's going to be bigger in the future,"
121840,126400," right? So as we add more and more features. And this is a framework for developing"
127120,131680," single page applications. So what you can do in this framework, you can have a page,"
131680,139040," which you can click things on and you can have different pages. And as you can see, it even"
139040,146320," automatically manages the URL. So it has a built-in router and yeah, this is a single page application"
146960,153280," that doesn't need any server. So yeah. And all of that is in the framework of 65 lines of code."
153280,162400," Right. So what I was planning to do today is to try to integrate to some extent this framework in"
162400,170800," into Emote Jam or at least try to see how difficult it would be. Right. So Emote Jam looks like this. So for"
170800,176960," the photos who doesn't know, you basically can upload any image in there. Let's actually upload a sus"
176960,188480," kind of kind of sus image, not gonna lie. So, and then you can apply different filters on this thing."
188480,199040," So you can, yeah, hop, hopper, overheat, bounce, circle, laughing, blob, elevator, some different stuff."
200800,209600," I suppose pick just, you know, picks out of the corner. Matrix looks kind of sus, not gonna lie."
209600,213920," Yeah. And also flag."
213920,223120," So, and after that, after you pick the filter, right, you can render it, right? You can just render this"
223120,229280," entire thing and you can then download this image and you can upload it to BTTV or maybe using discord or"
229280,233600," something like that. So yeah, that's basically what it is. That's basically what it is. It's completely"
233600,238880," open source. You can do whatever you want with the source code. If you, if you can read the source code,"
238880,246400," of course. Um, and yeah, so the way we're going to integrate our front end frameworks. So there is at"
246400,253920," least three components in here, as you can see, like there's three, um, sections, right? So the select image"
253920,262720," section, the select filter section and render the GIF. And I just want to see how difficult or easy it is to"
262720,269360," basically wrap these three sections into separate Gretcher.js widgets that you can just like put into"
269360,277920," your web page, right? So in this framework, by the way, you describe the DOM in sort of like a React style,"
277920,285120," but using only functions, you know, React has GSX where you have embedded, um, tag language into the"
285120,290560," JavaScript. So then you use a preprocessor and it expands into just, you know, a bunch of classes"
290560,296240," and whatnot. Uh, we don't have any preprocessor. You create a DOM like this, uh, literally by calling"
296240,302640," functions and it's actually quite compact. I would say it's more compact than using XML tags, in my opinion,"
302640,309680," right? Because you can even compare that, right? So how would you describe a div in XML, right? Here's"
309680,317280," your div and here's your, uh, text inside of the div, right? And in the Gretcher.js, this is how it's"
317280,325200," going to look like, right? It's, you save four characters at least for, for, for the div tag. But if"
325200,332080," you have shit ton of div tags, imagine how much space you save in, in, in the, in the file. I don't know"
332080,340080," why it's that important, but I mean, uh, so anyway, let's see what we can do in here. I'm going to go"
340080,346480," into Emote Jam and I'm going to fetch the other stuff, I suppose. Just see, maybe we have a new"
346480,351200," changes in here or stuff like that. Uh, we don't really have anything special, so everything is up"
351200,360720," to date. So let me also go to the Gretcher.js, uh, and also, uh, fetch the other changes just in case,"
360720,365840," because you never know, you never know. Everything seems to be okay. So, and the way we're going to"
365840,374880," try to integrate our framework into our websites is first by copy pasting a file from one folder to"
374880,384880," another one. There we go. We almost integrated them together. They're almost integrated. Um, cue."
388720,395280," The next step we need to do is, uh, we need to include that file into the index.html. So we have"
395280,401680," a section where we include all the scripts. So let's actually include, um, let me say, oh, this one has"
401680,406960," to be an HTML mod to work properly. So this one is going to be script and this, this one is going to be"
406960,415280," SRC and we're going to put there what Gretcher.js. There we go. Our, um, website now includes this"
415280,421520," framework that consists of 65 lines of code. We just included 65 lines of code. Isn't that amazing? I"
421520,430240," think it's goddamn amazing. My God. Um, all right. So let me start the website. Um, I'm going to just start"
430240,438320," HTTP server at the port 6969. That was a bad idea. By the way, I should have actually put ampersand in"
438320,444320," here because I want to run it in a synchronous mode, so it doesn't block Emacs. And then I'm going to go in"
444320,451440," here and everything seems to be working. This is a local copy of, uh, something doesn't work. This is a"
451440,471520," supposed to be a local copy of Emote Jam, but something got jammed. Ah, uh, so fail to execute compile on WebAssembly."
471520,477680," What the hell is that?"
481440,490480," Is that? Oh, shit."
490480,494480," This is so dumb."
494480,508560," Um, okay. So on one of the previous sessions, I actually run on this port a completely different"
508560,515680," application. Right. And apparently the JavaScript from that old application got cached."
515680,521600," Uh, and now it's trying to run that cached version of the JavaScript."
521600,530560," Nice. Uh, web was, uh, was a good idea. Specifically, I, um, I think the JavaScript that is cached is from the"
530560,536960," Wazi stream. So, um, if you're interested in Wasm and Wazi, I would recommend to check it out."
538560,546480," Hmm. So this is the Wazi stream. Uh, so yeah, so yeah, we were running the server for Wazi application on"
546480,552000," the same port and the, uh, the code for, for, from this stream actually got cached and this is what is"
552000,556800," currently trying to execute. So I'm going to put this thing in the description. So it's going to be Wazi"
556800,562800," stream. There we go. So you can find it in here. If you're interested in this kind of stuff, it was a"
562800,570400," pretty cool stream. Um, I wonder how we can, uh, fix that problem. Uh, maybe I can open the dev tools"
570400,579600," and maybe as far as I know, um, yeah, disable cache and I'm going to just press some stuff and everything"
579600,588000," is working. Yes. Everything is working. Everything is twerking. All right. And as far as I know, we also,"
588000,596880," uh, so I just wanted to find the greater JS. Here is the greater JS and everything seems to be"
596880,604880," okey dokey karaoke. Isn't that amazing? I think it's goddamn amazing. My God, my God. It is so amazing."
604880,611280," All right. So let's take a look at what it takes to actually, uh, sort of wrap this component into,"
611280,619200," into greater JS component. So in the HTML, how that component looks like, uh, what do we usually even"
619200,628400," call it? So it's called, um, custom file, right? So custom preview and stuff like that. So maybe this"
628400,640400," center I think has to be called just, you know, preview, custom preview. So I don't even know. We need to come"
640400,646880," up with some sort of a name. Uh, so let me, let me think. So we have a lot of, um, WebGL in here that"
646880,654160," will probably have to move to some place. Uh, but for now, uh, let's create the greater JS component."
654880,663280," So what that component is going to be called, um, so do we already have a preview name taken? Um,"
663280,672560," so get element by ID. So the canvas is the preview. Okay. Oh boy. It's, it's kind of difficult to,"
672560,682000," to actually, um, um, maybe image selector. Let's go. Let's call it image selector. Right. So this is going"
682000,688320," to be just a function. Uh, and I don't think it needs to accept anything in here for now. Um,"
688320,695120," right. So, and the next thing we're going to do, we're going to return the DOM in here. Um, so what"
695120,702400," kind of things do we even have in here? So it's definitely going to be a diff, right? And that diff consists"
702400,712240," of another diff, um, right? Which has some sort of an input, right? And then this one also has an image in"
712240,722320," here. So an image actually has a sodium clone PNG, right? There we go. Uh, sodium clone PNG. So for the outer diff,"
722320,730800," uh, we have an attribute class equal to, um, uh, to widget. So this is what we got. Uh, all right."
730800,735440," So this is the outer thing for the diff. I wonder what's going to be better to, yeah, let's, let's"
735440,747200," actually put it like this. Uh, so the diff itself, um, has the class, uh, class equal to widget element,"
747200,753760," right? Not elevator element, right? So this is the widget element. And inside of this thing,"
753760,759440," yeah, this one is also attribute. Might as well actually copy paste this entire thing, right?"
759440,766160," Might as well copy paste it. And, uh, this one also has to have this kind of stuff. And"
766160,774000," also it needs some sort of an ID, uh, right? So this one has an ID"
778000,783440," custom preview. So basically what I'm doing in here, I'm taking this thing and I'm translating it to,"
783440,786400," uh, gratitude JS. So, um,"
786400,790720," so that's pretty much it"
790720,796240," for the input. That is going to be interesting, I think,"
796240,804640," because we don't even have input in there. As far as I can tell, as far as I can tell,"
804640,818640," we don't even have an input in there. So, okay, attribute ID custom file, right? So custom file."
818640,831040," And another one is going to be attribute type file. There we go. So this is our image selector. This is our"
831040,836400," image selector. To be fair, I don't really want to depend on,"
836400,852480," I don't really want to depend, um, on this kind of ideas. I want the, uh, component to be,"
854640,861600," uh, to be a black box, right? So, um, the system should just create this component and it should"
861600,866880," throw an input to do it. This one doesn't really accept any inputs. It only interacts with the user,"
866880,870640," right? That's what we know for sure. This thing only interacts with the user."
870640,876960," Uh, and also it has the output and what's going to be the output. I suppose the output essentially,"
877520,884640," uh, uh, is going to be user selected an image, right? User selected an image or an image changed. So it's"
884640,892320," going to generate events and then you'll probably be able to add your own sort of callback for, for this"
892320,900480," kind of events and whatnot. So we'll see how it's going to go. And that way, I think you should not depend"
901120,909920," on, um, uh, on ideas and stuff like that, because the logic that needs those ideas is going to be"
909920,916880," encapsulated inside of this component completely, hopefully. Right. And that way, like, maybe we can"
916880,922720," completely get rid of these ideas. That would be actually kind of cool. So, and that way, maybe we're"
922720,930160," going to have something like image input and, uh, this image input is going to be just something that has a"
930160,937520," type, uh, that has a type file. And that way you can simply say something like image input. There we go."
937520,948000," So do we need any other IDs? Um, to be fair, I don't think so, but, uh, image preview. So this is going"
948000,953680," to be something like this, right? So this is the image preview. We don't need an ID in here. All right."
953680,959200," And, uh, there we go. There we go. There we go. This is an image preview."
959200,966320," I'm not even sure why I have a div in here, but I mean, I, I do have it. So it is what it is."
966320,974160," So image preview. There we go. Uh, so, and they also have a class widget in here."
975040,983680," Um, okay. So once we created that, uh, usually the next thing we do, we set up different, um,"
983680,991840," yeah, as you can see, we set up different callbacks. Um, so this one is going to be custom preview."
992560,1009920," Unload. Um, maybe just maybe we need to add like special callbacks in there, special callbacks."
1014720,1023680," So in this one is going to be, uh, results, right? So this is the actual component in here."
1023680,1030640," So this is going to be results and maybe in here, we're going to start adding special methods, right?"
1030640,1034880," So in the special methods are going to be something like, um,"
1034880,1042480," a thing that is going to be called, uh, when, um, the image was selected, right?"
1044720,1052960," Um, so I think this thing should be similar to event listeners, right? So event, uh,"
1052960,1060400," on, um, let's put it this way, on, uh, changed, uh, on changed. And it's going to be something like this."
1060400,1068800," And, uh, essentially this is going to be a function, right? That accepts the callback that is called when"
1068800,1073280," something is changed, right? And maybe we're going to have like a several of these callbacks, right?"
1073280,1079600," So it's going to be something like callbacks. Uh, this is going to be the list, right? And"
1079600,1088400," so here they are. Maybe, uh, I don't know. I think const only affects whether you can reassign this"
1088400,1094320," variable or not, right? So this is the only thing that callback affects. So I think if you have something"
1094320,1100480," const, you can still, uh, like append into that array, right? So if I have something like const access,"
1100480,1105920," all right, and then I can push into this array, I still can do that. So const only affects whether"
1105920,1112000," you can reassign it or not. All right. So, um, and here, what we're going to have here is a callbacks,"
1112000,1123360," push the callback. Uh, so maybe we can call these things on changed, uh, callbacks, uh, on changed,"
1124560,1131920," on changed callbacks and we push that specific callback in here. So the next thing, uh, when"
1131920,1135440," something changes in here, we're going to be like iterating through all of these callbacks and we're"
1135440,1139280," going to be notifying like everyone who's interested in these kinds of things, right?"
1139280,1149840," So, and this feels more like a custom event listener. Uh, and I wonder if in JavaScript,"
1149840,1155920," there is a way to have your own custom events and custom event listeners, event listeners, custom"
1155920,1164960," events. Is that a thing that you can have creating and triggering events? Okay. Um, so, okay. So we have"
1164960,1178000," event build creating a custom event, um, and what is the element, um, dispatch events. This one is"
1178000,1190640," interesting, uh, dispatch event, event targets. So, uh, we have a thing called event target. Event target"
1190640,1197440," is a DOM interface implemented by object that can receive events and may have listeners for them."
1197440,1201920," Okay. So maybe this is the mechanism that we have to reuse in here. That's actually pretty cool."
1201920,1210240," Uh, so that way, uh, we probably don't need any of this stuff, right? We probably don't need any of"
1210240,1218000," this stuff. Essentially what we'll have to do when something happens is just dispatch, uh, dispatch event,"
1218000,1227200," new, uh, uh, event, um, updated or something, right? Or changed. Uh, right. And we could, uh, I suppose you"
1227200,1232800," can also attach additional stuff in there. Uh, I didn't custom date to custom event. Okay. So custom event."
1232800,1240080," All right. Uh, custom event. And what we can put in there, we can put the image data, right? Image data"
1240080,1248720," that you can then use in, um, in a texture and whatnot. Okay. So this is actually way better. This is"
1248720,1254720," actually way better. Um, I suspected that there is already, you know, mechanism that you can use and I"
1254720,1260960," was right, apparently. So yeah, you can just grab this mechanism and that's pretty convenient. Uh, all right."
1260960,1267760," All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I want to actually kind of test this"
1267760,1281840," kind of stuff, but I'm not 100% sure how. So maybe we can try to add this sort of like a small image selector,"
1281840,1290080," image selector into the page alongside with this one, right? So let's actually put something like, uh,"
1290080,1299920," h2, uh, let's actually use, uh, the, the snippets, h2, uh, testing, right? Testing, uh, testing."
1299920,1311760," So this is basically, basically a testing entry point. Uh, all right. And what I want to do in here now,"
1311840,1330000," when we do on load, right? This one is also testing, um, um, document, document, get element by ID"
1330000,1338720," testing, right? And then append child image selector. And let's see how it is going to work."
1339520,1341760," All righty. All righty. All righty."
1341760,1350480," Okay. So we have a testing, but we don't have the actual image in here, which is kind of sus,"
1350480,1358160," probably because we have some certain error input is not defined. Okay. So I wonder what is an input tag?"
1358160,1364720," Is that like a mundane tag or does it require like, can it have children? I feel like it cannot have"
1364720,1372160," children, right? So it's one of those tags, um, that is like in line tag. Is there any term for,"
1372160,1384000," for such tags in, uh, in web, um, to, to, to, to form three definition tag specifies maybe,"
1384000,1388560," maybe not, but in any case, I'm going to go to the greater JS and I'm going to just create the input tag."
1388560,1393440," So it's going to be a function input. I suppose it's not going to accept anything. I'm not even"
1393440,1398640," sure if it needs to accept anything, but it can accept type. Uh, I think this is one of the things"
1398640,1404320," we can accept because when you define an input, you instantly immediately want to define its type. That"
1404320,1410000," makes sense to me at least. So we're going to define input, right? And then we're going to assign an"
1410000,1417840," attribute here, uh, type type. There we go. And we have an input here. All right. So let's go back. Uh,"
1417840,1424720," let's refresh everything. And there we go here. Here we have that, which is totally identical. Uh,"
1424720,1430240," they're now identical completely, um, which is kind of cool. Not gonna lie. Um,"
1430240,1440080," so we have a widget and you have a whole section, uh, testing and yeah, but, uh, when you change this"
1440080,1445120," thing, it does not automatically change the preview. So this is one of the things that we'll need to fix in"
1445120,1455600," here. Uh, this is one of the things we'll need to fix in here. So the original image, uh, I think it's called"
1455600,1467680," preview, custom preview, custom preview, right. And, uh, on loading this entire thing. Yeah, we have on the change."
1468320,1487920," All right. We have on change these files. Uh, so I suppose we'll need to actually"
1487920,1497200," go and assign event listener to the select image selector."
1498160,1504640," Right. Because we have this input, right? So this is the image input, uh, image input, add"
1504640,1512240," event listener. And the question is, how do we know what kind of events got generated? Okay. So let's,"
1512240,1518240," let's say something like changed. I'm going to try to assume that that's what happened. And, uh, here"
1518240,1526320," we have the probably event, um, and we can try to print."
1528000,1537040," Uh, so let's do console.log. Right. So it's going to be like this console.log. Uh, this, I want to print"
1537040,1547600," this just to see what's there and the event itself. There we go. There we go. So, um, now, um, okay. So it's,"
1547600,1555360," it's, it's, it's a favicon, nothing particularly special. And I think that didn't generate any event."
1555360,1564400," So on change. Oh, this is probably because it's called change, not changed. Okay. That makes sense."
1564400,1574480," All right. So if I try to update this thing, there we go. This is the element itself. Event contains this kind of"
1574480,1583520," stuff. Uh, does it contain files? Uh, I know. Well, you can take the files from this thingy, right? You can"
1583520,1590960," take the files from this thingy, um, something like files, right? Something like files. And if I try to run"
1590960,1597440," it one more time, here is the list of files. And, uh, we also have a type and stuff like that. So we have"
1597440,1602400," everything in here. So we have a special event. So here's the thing. Here's the problem with the"
1602400,1609120," Grature.js components. You can't destroy them, right? Essentially you created the component and that"
1609120,1615760," component added event listener to, to this element, right? And, uh, there's no way to remove that event"
1615760,1624160," listener. Um, and I wonder if it matters that much. I guess, uh, if it's attached to the node,"
1625040,1631520," right, that is internal node of the component, and then you detach this node and forget about it,"
1631520,1637040," throw it away, I think it's not going to cause the problem. But if your component, like for instance,"
1637040,1644960," a router adds event listeners to the window, you cannot just throw away the router, um, and, um, expect"
1644960,1649840," that the garbage collector will clean everything up because the, um, the function, right, that you put in"
1649840,1655680," there still keeps point, uh, references to this entire component. So I don't really know how precisely"
1655680,1663120," the JavaScript, um, system works, but I would assume if you have an event listener to the node that is"
1663120,1670320," forgotten, maybe it doesn't cause that much problems. Maybe it does. We'll probably have to research that."
1670320,1674720," Um, so I'm not a web developer again, so I don't know. Maybe, maybe it, maybe it does cause problems."
1674720,1681760," Maybe it does not. Uh, anyways, anyways, so we have a change in here and what I want to put in this change"
1681760,1688720," is, uh, probably, uh, I want to trigger something in image preview, right? So I want to send this data to"
1688720,1700080," the image preview. So custom preview. So, and in here, uh, right, custom on change, right, custom on change,"
1700080,1706560," and we take a custom preview and we assign a new object to it. So that's precisely what we want to do in here."
1706560,1716560," Right. So I'm going to take custom preview, uh, SRC, and I'm assigning create object URL from this specific file,"
1716560,1726240," right, uh, from this specific file. That's really, really strange, but okay. Um, and that will trigger an update"
1726240,1731520," event in a custom preview. So it's actually called, not called custom preview. It's called image preview. So we have an"
1731520,1737760," image input, you have that image input that updates image preview, uh, and in image preview, uh, we're"
1737760,1745120," going to add event listener. Uh, we're going to add an event listener and I suppose the event that we're"
1745120,1771280," looking for is load, right? Um, so it's going to be function. Um, load and you can also have an error. So let's put it this way."
1771280,1784160," Okay. Console. Um, image, um, image, uh, updated, right? Image updated. Um, and I suppose we can also do something"
1784160,1797280," like image preview add event listener error. Um, and in that particular case, I suppose what we're going to do in here is"
1797280,1819680," So custom file, yeah, I suppose, uh, image input, image, yeah, image input, and this SRC equal to error.PNG."
1821120,1832800," All right. So I think, I think I did that. I think I managed to do that. Um, and what's interesting in here,"
1832800,1841280," what we probably have to do, we have to dispatch, uh, a custom event, dispatch event, new custom event,"
1842480,1850800," um, something like, um, image selected, right? Image selected. And then we can add, um, custom data in here."
1850800,1856880," Right. And then whoever created this company and they will be able to add their own, um, like event"
1856880,1862640," listener to this custom event. And they don't have to think about this chain of events, right? This chain"
1862640,1868080," of events is completely now encapsulated in image selector, right? Since we have two components in here,"
1868080,1874640," we have like two element chain first, the input updates, and it sends the update to image and"
1874640,1879840," image updates, and it sends the update to, uh, the rest of the element to update, uh, their own thing."
1879840,1884720," Now this chain of two things going to be encapsulated into a single component and you don't have to worry"
1884720,1889280," about it. You have to worry about a single event, which is whether updated image or not. You don't need"
1889280,1894240," to think about errors in here. So if error happens, uh, you will never know about that. It's just like,"
1894240,1900960," it's a matter of this thing or maybe not. Well, if error happens, we should still send an update,"
1900960,1907280," right? We should still send an update. Um, oh, it will automatically send here, right? So it will"
1907280,1911920," basically set error PNG and it will redirect back to here and then the image will be updated and"
1911920,1918640," everything's going to be notified. Okay. So sounds good to me. Sounds good to me. Uh, all right. So"
1919600,1925360," that's pretty nice. Pretty, pretty, pretty nice."
1925360,1939920," All right. And it says image updated, image debated, image updated. Uh, that's pretty pogue. That's pretty"
1939920,1952880," cool. Not gonna lie. Um, and let's think how we're gonna do all of these things. So the next step is"
1952880,1960240," going to be actually, uh, dispatching the event that something is updated and then we'll have to encapsulate"
1960240,1967040," this thing into a separate component and we should expose a method from this company to accept,"
1967040,1974160," to accept images. Um, and we will have to connect these two companies together, right? We'll have"
1974160,1981360," to connect them together and see how they react to each other, right? So, um, that way these things"
1981360,1986480," become reusable companies that we can, we'll be able to even, uh, copy paste in different places. And I"
1986480,1990800," want them to be completely decoupled from each other. I think it's going to be a very cool thing."
1990800,2001440," Uh, very useful thing. So, okay. Yeah. Um, so I want to make a small break just a second."
2001440,2005360," Um, just need to need to gather my thoughts. Um,"
2008480,2019200," All right. So, uh, let's try to dispatch the event with the image, uh, with the image data, um,"
2019200,2024000," to the rest of the components that could be interested in this kind of stuff."
2024000,2031520," Uh, so custom. Yeah. So you just create a custom event, uh, with a custom name and stuff like that,"
2031520,2037600," and you attach some, some data to it. Okay. So let's quickly do that. So the component relative"
2037600,2043360," to which we're actually sending all of that is going to be a result. Um, and in here we probably"
2043360,2049440," need, you know, some data, right? And it just depends what we precisely are doing in there. So"
2049440,2057760," this one is going to be custom preview, uh, in a custom preview. So we're just sending ourselves,"
2057760,2063840," I suppose, because when we create a texture from an image, right, you can create textures straight up from"
2063840,2071840," an image tag, uh, which is okay, which is fine, I suppose. So it means here we can actually, um,"
2071840,2077840," do something like image data and we're going to solve ourselves. We're going to solve this, uh, image."
2077840,2084320," Um, yeah. So since the component is called image selector, right? The event that is going to be"
2084320,2090480," dispatched is going to be image selected, right? Uh, and, uh, the image itself is going to be sent in there,"
2090480,2096240," right? So, because that's the data and then you can construct, um, you can construct the texture"
2096240,2103520," out of this entire thing. All right. Makes sense. Uh, so now I just appended the, the selector,"
2104800,2112400," um, might as well actually, um, save it somewhere here. So it's going to be something like this."
2112400,2119680," Uh, and in here, right. Um, for some reason I cannot just add a new line in here. Okay. Thank you very"
2119680,2127840," much. Add event listener. And, uh, we're going to listen to image selected. Uh, and the function is going"
2127840,2134640," to take the event, right? Or maybe we'll just call it a, uh, and let's just, you know, print it. Huh?"
2134640,2144400," Okay. Console log. Uh, let's actually wrap things around in here, right? It wraps things around, uh,"
2144400,2152240," console log image selected, right? And we're going to provide the event and let's see if event actually"
2152240,2159520," contains these things, uh, we're interested in. All right. So, uh, let me, let me see now. Uh,"
2159520,2165760," all right. So this is the testing. Uh, yeah, we already received custom event and in a custom event,"
2165760,2180320," do we have the data? Um, so SOC target type, um, I didn't see the data though. Uh, how can we know"
2181920,2190480," that we've got the data? Uh, maybe we can just do something like, um, I better take a look at this"
2190480,2200800," thing. Right. Detail. It is called detail. All right. Detail is new actually. So that means, um,"
2207600,2212880," Oh, you're supposed to put it into the detail, aren't you?"
2212880,2220560," Mm-hmm. Uh, I see. I see what's going on. Um,"
2229120,2243840," So let's put it like this. So this one is going to be, uh, let's, let's, let's keep printing this"
2243840,2251280," entire thing. All right. So, and we have a detail and here is the image data and image data is the image"
2251280,2259040," widget. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Uh, so we finished the new, the image select,"
2259040,2265840," two components. This is awesome. This is absolutely awesome. I really like that. Um, so the next"
2265840,2274800," component that we probably need to implement is the image, uh, filter selector rather. Yeah. It has to"
2274800,2280560," be called filter selector. Let's see what we can do in here. So this one is going to be filter selector,"
2280560,2286560," right? And in here, uh, yeah, we'll have to do a lot of things in here because here we'll have to"
2286560,2293440," initialize open GL and whatnot. And it's actually a lot of work to be fair. Um, it is in fact a lot of"
2293440,2302640," work and also we establish like animation loop and whatnot. Oh boy. Oh boy. But essentially here we'll"
2302640,2308640," have to, well, we can just copy paste this entire stuff there and don't worry about it. So it shouldn't"
2308640,2320240," be that big of an issue. Also we need to move the on drop and drag over, um, yeah, to the, to the customized thing."
2327440,2341120," So we can expose these two lines in the file selector as, um, as a method, right? That's essentially what"
2341120,2348640," we can do. We can expose them as a method, uh, but probably not for now. Um, but the way we probably"
2348640,2359600," gonna, uh, gonna do that is just results. Um, so send files, right? Send files. And, uh, this one"
2359600,2365360," is going to be simply a function that accepts the files, uh, and it's going to just do that thing."
2365360,2370800," And when we're handling, handling the events, when we do document on event listening, blah, blah, blah,"
2370800,2374560," we're going to be calling this function, but not for now. Uh, so maybe I'm going to put it,"
2374560,2385120," put it to do in here image, uh, selector component, component does not handle, um, drag and, uh, drag"
2385120,2392160," and drop, drag and drop. There we go. Does not handle this thing. So filter selector, let's take a look"
2392160,2402960," at the filter selector. Um, so filter, um, select the filter. So this one is pretty straightforward. Yet again,"
2402960,2410480," it's just, um, uh, a bunch of divs and whatnot. Um, so this one is going to be something like,"
2410480,2418720," oh boy. So if it says filter selector, um, um, so it's called filter list, right? This one is going"
2418720,2426800," to be filter list. And the filter list is essentially a div, um, which contains, uh, a text, right? It contains"
2426800,2444800," a select, um, and we don't need an ID in here, right? We don't need an ID in here. Um, so, and maybe"
2444800,2453840," because of that, the filter list, in fact, has to be this simple select, uh, all right. And we don't have a"
2453840,2461680," select in greater JS, but it doesn't really matter right now. All right. So, and, uh, filter preview."
2461680,2468160," This is the filter preview. This is the canvas and does canvas. I think canvas is just a mundane,"
2468160,2473600," um, mundane text. So that means I can just set some of these attributes in here like this."
2474480,2484000," Uh, so it's going to be width, um, one, one, two, then it's going to be height, then it's going to be class,"
2484000,2490720," uh, widget element, right? So this is going to be class widget element. And to be fair,"
2490720,2497040," maybe it could be actually done a little bit later. Okay. So, and in here, uh, we're going to have a result,"
2497040,2506880," which is essentially div, uh, with the attribute class, uh, class widget, right? So this is the class widget."
2506880,2515360," And in here, we have another div with the attribute class, uh, widget element, widget element."
2515360,2524560," Right. So in that div, we have a text filter, and then we have a filter list. There we go. That's what we're"
2524560,2532480," having here. We're going to be having it like that. And then, uh, filter preview. There we go. Cool."
2532480,2538800," So, uh, we composed everything we wanted to compose. And after that, we can be returning all that stuff."
2538800,2544320," Uh, nice, nice, nice, nice."
2549200,2554800," And we'll have to basically move the OpenGL initialization code into the filter selector."
2554800,2560000," And we'll see how it goes. We'll see how it goes. Um,"
2560000,2569920," All right. So, uh, let me see if this entire thing is going to even work. So, um,"
2569920,2576160," so let's put it like this. It's going to be entry. Uh, I'm going to put this entire thing like that."
2576800,2585360," So entry, append child, uh, entry, append child, uh, filter selector. Right. So now we have a filter"
2585360,2594160," selector in here. Um, and let's refresh the page. Do we have anything in here? No, we don't. And this"
2594160,2600160," is because we don't have a select. Let's go into GratureJS. And as far as I know, select, um, does it"
2600160,2606800," accept? I think select is a mundane straight up mind mundane tank. Uh, I just made up the word. I'm"
2606800,2611680," pretty sure the word is, uh, the term is actually completely different. HTML select. Okay. Let me"
2611680,2620560," take a look. So yeah, it actually can have children and stuff like that. So it is totally fine for us"
2620560,2627200," to, um, make it a mundane tag. So I'm going to go to the GratureJS and I'm going to just straight up put a"
2627200,2635360," select in here. Right. Uh, there we go. There we go. So what do we have in here? Everything. Okay. So"
2635360,2643360," here we have a filter and all of this good stuff. So we probably also have a canvas, hopefully. Where is"
2643360,2652240," the canvas? Here's the canvas, but it's not really, uh, properly, um, how to say that properly, uh, aligned,"
2652240,2657520," right properly aligned. I have a little bit of a fever right now for some reason. I don't know why."
2657520,2665920," Um, uh, maybe I'm getting sick slowly. The, this, oh yeah. So I do remember that I wanted to make this"
2665920,2676560," thing, um, something like this. There we go. Uh, and is it going to be working something? Okay. So yeah,"
2676560,2682960," there we go. So here is the canvas. It's actually aligned perfectly. Uh, everything looks okidoki"
2682960,2688960," karaoke. So, uh, this is where we initialize all the components. We put them into several variables"
2688960,2695120," because we want to like keep track of these variables. So, uh, next thing we need to do OpenGL"
2695120,2702080," initialization. So we do have a canvas, right? And the next thing we want to do in here probably"
2702080,2711040," is to get a jail context of that canvas. So this one is going to be filter, filter preview, right? So"
2711040,2718320," here's the filter preview. We get the context and no anti-aliasing or any of these jazz. Also, we want"
2718320,2723920," to throw an exception if something goes wrong. For example, client doesn't support WebGL or whatnot."
2723920,2731360," Uh, after that we want to enable a blending and stuff like that. Right. We want to enable blending."
2731360,2741520," Uh, and there we go. So also we have a filters. Oh, all right. Yes, yes, yes. I see."
2743520,2755600," We also have these things. So filter list. Uh, so we go through all the filters and this is the filter"
2755600,2762240," select. So we have to move a lot of things in here. We have to move a lot of things in there. Um,"
2762240,2772240," but maybe that's fine. Maybe we can extract filter list into its own component as well. That would be"
2772240,2781680," interesting actually. So filter list is its own component and then filter selector, uh, would be a"
2781680,2788080," company that uses filter list. So, and all this logic of actually populating the filter list is going to be"
2788080,2794080," inside of the construction of that filter. So that kind of makes sense to me. And also it can add"
2794080,2800720," automatically its own like wheel event and whatnot. So we don't have to worry about that. All right. So let"
2800720,2812800," me see what we can do in here. Um, so function filter list. All right. And to be fair, it might, it may"
2812800,2820960," accept the filters as the, as the parameter, but, but maybe we can just keep relying on the, um, on the global"
2820960,2826720," name for now, at least, at least for now. So this one is going to be just a result and it's going to be"
2826720,2834800," simply select. All right. There we go. So, and, uh, then I'm going to be iterating through all the names"
2834800,2847280," in the filters. Right. And then I'm going to do a result, uh, result, uh, add new option, uh, and that name."
2847280,2864480," So do I do anything else with these things? Uh, and then on filter change, uh, I also need to notify"
2864480,2872160," somebody. So on filter change, I suppose, I suppose, um, what I'm going to do, I'm going to just throw an"
2872160,2878560," event and it's like responsibility for whoever uses this component to handle that event and do something"
2878560,2897840," about it. All right. So it probably also makes sense for me to move this entire thing in here. Right. Um,"
2897840,2912880," populating the filter list, uh, filter list. Um, so in here, this is the results, right. This is the component. Um,"
2912880,2923980," so wheels prevent default and this one change okay that makes sense all right"
2923980,2939640," all right so let's go back down there select and we need to add another event"
2939640,2949520," listener in here so it's going to result add event listener and event listener change function that"
2949520,2960560," does other things and in here we're actually sending the filter the whole filter and you know"
2960560,2966000," what i think we can we can do that so let me let me try to do that so this is going to be a result"
2966000,2978140," um result dispatch event uh new custom event new custom event uh so this one is going to be"
2978140,2985380," filter changed filter changed and in here we can have a detail right detail"
2985380,2995460," for the filter and uh the actual filter is going to be something like uh like this"
2995460,3006060," uh options selected options zero all right uh there we go so this"
3006060,3015540," i wonder wait a second when i refer to this inside of an object i suppose i'm referring"
3015540,3019440," yeah i think it should be all right i'm pretty sure it should be all right"
3019440,3027340," uh but i mean in just in case i can always just say a result right so okay so we have result"
3027340,3036280," add event changed and then changed filter and we can forward further this thing um but maybe"
3036280,3042540," that is actually kind of well i mean it would be super convenient to just like deal with the filter"
3042540,3049020," right so yeah it would be super convenient to deal just with the filter and don't don't have to deal"
3049020,3058760," with anything else um so i think the filter select is no longer needed in here right so yeah this is how"
3058760,3070440," we initialized everything in here um and we're going to connect this stuff quite nicely uh filter list"
3070440,3078280," this one is going to be filter list but how this entire thing is going to be called um filter list"
3078280,3081640," i don't know i'm going to call it underscore"
3081640,3088280," at least for now i'm not sure how to call that but what i'm going to do in here"
3088920,3094280," is i'm going to do filter list just to test it out right i just want to test it out and see if it"
3094280,3102760," works or not so yeah so an hour from rock basically consists of composing these components together"
3102760,3110200," essentially right so it's basically like having no framework whatsoever and there we go here are the"
3110200,3118280," filters so believe it or not here are all the filters in here uh so another interesting thing is that um"
3119080,3127640," select filter just a second can i wrap it into a diff right can i wrap it into a diff um and have it"
3127640,3136200," as a widget element so it's uh basically aligned properly so it's gonna be a widget element i think"
3136200,3142200," that should work and there we go it is aligned perfectly so and also it handles it yeah so let me take"
3142200,3148520," a look at the errors uh does it have any errors uh it doesn't seem to be this on change is not a function"
3148520,3157160," okay so um i wonder why it is not a function excuse me uh are you sure about that"
3159640,3167400," huh huh"
3167400,3173960," where are we always having this error"
3173960,3174920," having this error"
3174920,3192280," so this maybe instead of this we have to use the result now how about that this result"
3193800,3198360," let me just do that and then it is going here"
3198360,3201560," and"
3201560,3214200," was it always broken just a second was it always broken"
3219080,3219880," no it wasn't"
3219880,3226440," why is it broken specifically for me excuse me"
3226440,3231960," this on change filter select"
3231960,3235000," why is this not"
3235000,3239640," a function"
3239640,3245400," i'm really really confused because the result is a select"
3245400,3246680," right result is a select"
3246680,3251800," and it just doesn't have that um"
3251800,3256680," is that because we don't handle this thing in any way in any way"
3256680,3261080," well i mean it's probably not"
3261080,3264360," maybe i copy pasted something incorrectly"
3264360,3266840," all right let's make a cup of tea"
3266840,3274760," all right so i'm back to the back champion of the arena and"
3274760,3278360," i'm trying to understand what the has happened and why doesn't it work"
3278360,3281720," so let me try to print this thing"
3281720,3286600," just to see what the is the result maybe i'm just misunderstanding what the hell is the result"
3286600,3290920," uh let me see so this is the"
3290920,3300840," the stuff and i'm trying to do this thing it is a select but you don't have an on change for that select"
3300840,3304280," okay so but can i do that thing on this one"
3304280,3313080," uh i can do that so let's find another on change uh let's find another on change and let's actually"
3313080,3320680," print this to see what's the difference between them what is so special about this thing all right"
3320680,3323560," so uh yeah so it has id filters"
3323560,3330520," i don't know"
3330520,3336920," so that is really strange like this one is also select but it cannot handle"
3336920,3342360," but it doesn't have on change for some reason is that because i constructed it in a particular like"
3342360,3349880," weird way uh okay javascript um so let me take a look at the error let me take a look at the error and just"
3349880,3356840," see uh maybe we can google this thing up um all right html select element okay"
3357480,3368360," html select uh element on change right is there any problems"
3374920,3391080," ah this is probably because we changed it because we actually set it"
3398600,3399160," i see"
3399160,3404440," this is because we actually set it um"
3404440,3410920," uh and before that it didn't exist that's why"
3410920,3418040," okay that's very interesting um i guess that's the explanation in here"
3420040,3426040," to the select all right so is there any way to trigger on changed but without calling this function"
3426040,3437560," directly like is do i have to dispatch a change event uh okay so html select element uh trigger uh on"
3437560,3444680," change right uh on change to go for already selected uh elements blah blah blah um"
3449400,3458520," bind focus on uh bind change change uh so maybe i have to actually call change but not on change is"
3458520,3467160," that what i have to do um so what if i do something like change right um well i have to actually find"
3467160,3474600," this change and put it in here uh all right so is it gonna work no it's still not a thing it is still"
3474600,3481400," another change is not a function all right um but on change is also another function and this is because"
3481400,3488120," we never actually said it because we set everything through the event listeners um so i'm pretty sure"
3488120,3497720," yeah so let's actually see some discussions of this thing uh something simple i search internet and"
3497720,3508040," and i found a syntax error and cause okay uh all right and on change okay so this is a typo um"
3508040,3511880," this is not what i mean"
3519560,3537640," but i mean we can always just do it like that i mean since it's like an internal thing uh maybe"
3537640,3547800," this is what we can do right for now at least um so i guess uh i think this is the easiest solution for now"
3547800,3556440," um okay when you see yeah and it works okay so yeah i'm gonna just leave it for now since it's"
3556440,3560760," encapsulated completely inside of the filter list it probably doesn't really matter that much right"
3560760,3570040," probably doesn't really matter that much uh so yeah we can now select these things and it will trigger"
3570040,3575480," different events and it will it's actually specifically will trigger filter changed all right it triggers filter"
3575480,3582840," changed so this is the filter list then we compose the final thing in here and when the filter changes we"
3582840,3594840," have to sort of update the um we have to update the actual texture but to be able to do that we need"
3594840,3599560," we need to finish this is the initialization of the filter selector all right after we um"
3599560,3603800," did everything in here after we"
3603800,3610520," yeah enable that we have to create the program right we have to create the current program"
3610520,3616200," uh load filter program um"
3618200,3624920," and maybe that's precisely what we want to what we want to copy paste into filter selector right that's"
3624920,3630360," what we want to copy paste in here so we loaded this thing up we initialized everything so here's the"
3630360,3639560," program load filter program it accepts that stuff okay so and then we don't care about this thing um"
3641720,3650440," custom preview didn't care about that so this is what we need to move mesh position uh and yeah we only"
3650440,3656440," have a mesh position in here as far as i can tell so that's totally fine so let's copy paste this stuff in"
3656440,3664600," here uh and after that we need to initialize the event loop that's right we're initializing the event loop and"
3664600,3678200," we're like playing this entire thing uh all right so that should be all right uh okay go that's pretty cool"
3678200,3690200," pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty uh filter list underscore select options vertex attributes and so on"
3690200,3697000," and so forth so in here we're doing filter release but now uh let me actually try to run this into"
3697000,3704040," i think okay so nothing particularly special filter uh selector there we go we have a filter selector"
3704040,3711000," and let's see it crashing uh vertex trips is not defined okay so that's fair enough vertex trips this"
3711000,3716280," is because it's not global uh let's put it somewhere here all right so it's a global thing now"
3718360,3728200," uh uh custom preview is not defined okay so it's gonna be 1119 uh custom preview well this one is very"
3728200,3728840," interesting"
3728840,3738120," this one is rather rather interesting"
3738120,3748200," uh width and height but we know for a fact that custom preview"
3748360,3758760," uh emote size uniform um so we should uh we should keep track not only of the current program but"
3758760,3766120," also of the current image that we're processing right so we need to have something like emote image right"
3766120,3774760," so uh maybe at the beginning is going to be undefined but when it's defined we'll have to use emote image in"
3774760,3780680," here so remote image so this is going to be width and height"
3780680,3788280," and we'll need a special function in here we'll need a special function to handle all of that stuff"
3788280,3797400," so i'm just thinking how can we put that function so we might as well actually put image in here"
3797400,3809880," and then result uh results something like um update image right so this can be a special function um like this"
3809880,3820760," and what we're doing here uh we accept uh new emote image right new emote image and remote image set to"
3821800,3830600," uh image but that's not enough uh what we have to do in here um we have to reload that specific texture"
3830600,3834840," right we have to reload that specific texture but that's going to be a completely different story"
3834840,3839000," uh so and i suppose in here"
3839000,3848360," i wonder if we can safely set all that stuff like that we also have a canvas in here which is not"
3848360,3857160," particularly great idea um but the canvas in this particular case is a filter preview right it is a"
3857160,3859880," filter preview just a second i lost the okay"
3859880,3874120," filter preview there we go oh boy okay let's take a look at other um one one 26 um all right so it still"
3874120,3879000," throws an error and i suppose maybe one of the things we're doing here we just want to check if it's"
3879000,3884440," available only then we're going to set it otherwise we're not going to send it and there's no texture"
3884440,3891400," bound okay so that's totally fine uh luckily webgl context actually stops reporting errors after some"
3891400,3897960," time it's already goddamn working look at that oh my god this is actually super cool it's already working"
3899800,3911480," okay um so how we are initializing the image um so so load program create texture okay so we are creating"
3911480,3918440," a texture from cast okay i see what's going on in here uh i see what's going on in here um"
3920360,3928840," so and update image we set emote image in here and um what we're essentially doing is"
3928840,3936760," do we even set it anywhere so we just created uh emote texture and emote texture is just needed to"
3936760,3946040," delete the thing okay okay okay okay okay okay that makes sense um so emote texture"
3947080,3953000," undefined or maybe it could be like zero"
3953000,3956840," all right if emote texture"
3956840,3968040," is defined we do gl delete uh delete texture and we are deleting the emote texture that's pretty much"
3968040,3974920," it so that's quite important then we're creating a new one from the emote image"
3975960,3982280," and as far as i know that is it that it should be pretty much it and if we refresh this entire"
3982280,3987480," thing it's not going to particularly work but that's fine uh because we never actually connected"
3987480,3995080," those things together right so you have image selector uh right um so let's call this something"
3995080,4003880," like eg image selector right so it stands for like um emote gem image selector so we also put some"
4003880,4014360," handling in here and then we're going to do eg filter selector right selector filter selector so and"
4014360,4021480," now i want to actually connect them together in g image selector right so if image was selected right if"
4021480,4028120," image was selected i'm going to do eg filter selected selector and i'm going to update image"
4028120,4035800," in detail detail image data there we go so this is how i'm going to connect them uh connect them together"
4035800,4042760," and then um what essentially i'm going to be doing i'm going to get in the entry right i'm getting"
4042760,4053800," the entry and i'm appending a child diff uh and that's a good question that's a good question so maybe i'm"
4053800,4061000," gonna just do a very simple thing where i do eg image selector it's one thing and then eg filter"
4061000,4066520," selector there we go so i have two components and i put these components together um that's actually"
4066520,4073640," pretty cool right image selector emits images image filter consumes those images and just displays them"
4073640,4082600," and lets you select a filter um and then i'm going to have a second component uh for for rendering right and"
4082600,4090360," when you click a render it will ask filter selector i suppose to render a sequence of images and whatnot"
4090360,4097000," um and then we're going to get like a gif or something so yeah we're already basically decoupling"
4097000,4103080," this entire spaghetti into something more manageable hopefully we'll see if it become more manageable but"
4103080,4107720," i really wanted to have like these small separate components that you just wire up together and they"
4107720,4114040," just send information between each other so and uh yeah so then we can separate them completely they can"
4114040,4124440," be completely decoupled and maybe it's going to be manageable again i don't know i don't know we'll see"
4124440,4131560," we'll see the winner gets to you and also this is going to be like a testimony of our uh framework in"
4131560,4136040," production as we start using this framework in production we'll see what needs to be added into the"
4136040,4140200," framework what kind of things because like doing things like that is not particularly convenient"
4140200,4148200," as you can see right so if you're interested in particular uh sub dom uh you have to extract it into"
4148200,4154120," a separate variable which actually makes uh reading the entire dom kind of difficult uh all right it would"
4154120,4161880," be way better to somehow inline specify the id of this thing and being able to refer to that id in here i don't"
4161880,4169080," know how we're going to do that but we'll see we'll see uh anyway anyway um if i if i try to refresh this"
4169080,4176440," entire thing is it working it is not working okay one one uh 59 and uh it was trying to do something"
4176440,4184520," something strange this is because i forgot to uh save everything okay uh there is no texture bound it"
4184520,4199000," actually uh all right so if i update uh okay filters are not updated but are images updated they are"
4199000,4206280," believe it or not i can update the images now uh and that thing updates them accordingly so we have two"
4206280,4212680," components which are connected together but this company doesn't uh doesn't update the filters so this is"
4212680,4219960," probably something that we'll have to do uh this company doesn't update the filters so filter selector"
4219960,4230600," all right uh so we have just a filter list and the filter list uh says filter changed right"
4236360,4244120," so we do like a load so we do like a load all right maybe that's precisely what we're doing here so it's"
4244120,4251080," going to be filter list underscore add event listener right edit that listener and the event we're"
4251080,4262280," listening to is filter changed right filter changed and um so here we're going to be accepting events and the cool"
4262280,4279560," one thing about this stuff is we can just move this entire thing like that this is the program load filter"
4279560,4289400," uh load filter details filter right so we don't have to worry about this kind of stuff uh i think"
4290440,4296040," because we're sending the whole filter in here yes yes yes we're sending the whole filter in there um"
4296040,4301800," all right it's pretty poke right everything seems to be initializing here"
4301800,4309720," to be fair i think the opengl initialization the whole opengl initialization should be done somewhere"
4311320,4326440," up there right so this is purely opengl stuff and mesh position and whatnot all right and one of the"
4326440,4335640," things we can do is just rub this entire thing into its own sort of like a scope uh right right so this is"
4335640,4343960," going to be a scope and this is initialize gl right so we take the context and we initialize it maybe at"
4343960,4350600," some point this thing is going to be extracted to a separate procedure uh all right so when uh we also"
4350600,4357960," add a special um special method in here to update the image right to update the image so updating this"
4357960,4364440," this entire thing we delete the texture uh we have the distinct so we also for the filter list we handle"
4364440,4375000," filter changed and um then we load a new filter every time um okay so in here essentially what we have"
4375000,4379880," is an event loop right so it's not really event loop but it's a rendering loop let's actually call it"
4379880,4391720," rendering loop uh rendering loop okay ah cool so this is some sort of a state we get the gl we initialize"
4391720,4399080," it and everything and okay that looks fine more or less uh let's see what's going to happen okay so this"
4399080,4407400," something went wrong definitely cannot read property time uniform of undefined okay one one 36 um"
4407400,4413800," program time uniform uh all right so maybe that thing has to be something like this if"
4413800,4420440," program right only then try to do something about it"
4423640,4429880," also when i load filter do i delete the program somehow oh yeah we also need to delete it i see"
4429880,4437800," so it has to be something like this if program uh don't forget to delete its id right it's a similar"
4437800,4443160," thing in here like with the texture right if um it's defined don't forget to delete it and stuff like"
4443160,4448920," that uh all right so let's try to refresh this entire thing and draw a race no valid shader program"
4448920,4458200," in use okay so i kind of expected that so filter um at least doesn't throw um how to say that doesn't"
4458200,4467080," actually emit the first ever event right uh basically when you created it right it doesn't really do"
4467080,4476600," anything right so what we need to do we need to emit uh first filter changed event that's probably what we"
4476600,4482760," need to do so it's going to subject result uh dispatch event and what we're going to be dispatching in"
4482760,4490040," here well i suppose we're going to be dispatching this thing right so a little bit of a code duplicate"
4490040,4495720," but that's fine that is totally fine right so this is like the first thing"
4504200,4509960," so it would be kind of cool to have a function actually right where you put this entire thing"
4509960,4519000," right and so this entire stuff simply becomes f and then you call f only once"
4519000,4530040," um and you call f only once to be fair i'm an idiot i could have oh my god the am i doing right"
4532520,4540600," i could just call result unchanged precisely the same thing as i do in here okay so i said on change"
4540600,4547720," and yeah there we go so that's pretty pogue that's pretty pogue uh can we have anything in here and"
4547720,4554280," uh well no valid shader programming but at the same time it just does something but it still says that"
4554280,4561720," there is no valid program in use which is kind of sus i'm not gonna lie um it feels like it never actually"
4562520,4571960," i think i think i think i think i know what the f is going on here"
4571960,4583000," because we create this thing the event is um fired the event is fired but"
4584280,4596040," the event is fired but we have not set up the handler for that event yet that's precisely what happened"
4596040,4601480," in here so nothing much to say uh nothing much to say"
4601480,4615080," so i suppose we need to maybe since we know the filter list uh maybe we can specify some sort of like a"
4617800,4623160," function function in here so it's going to be a selected filter right and this one is going to be"
4623160,4629480," just a function which simply returns the selected filter nothing particularly special right something"
4629480,4636280," like this here is your selected filter and uh we might as well even do something like selected filter"
4637160,4646120," uh like this right so it's a result selected filter um and we don't need to do that thing anymore right"
4646120,4649160," we don't need to do that thing anymore"
4649160,4656360," uh and when we are creating a program right when we are creating a program we want to actually load this"
4656360,4663640," thing up like this right so this is going to be a program right so instead of this stuff we're going to be"
4663640,4673480," doing uh filter list underscore selected selected uh filter place there we go we have a selected filter"
4673480,4679800," um and that's pretty much it that's pretty much everything i wanted to do in here um"
4679800,4686920," and maybe we're going to do a similar thing for emote images but for now this thing should just"
4687560,4697160," uh should just work um so there's no uh gl in here so maybe that's because we have to put things"
4697160,4705800," oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy let's put them somewhere here maybe that's where we have to put them"
4705800,4712760," who knows uh all right are you gonna work now uh all right everything seems to be working and"
4714520,4724920," uh i also have a print when i select uh a change console yeah we shouldn't have that uh okay so i can"
4724920,4733160," already as you can see i i want to keep the console on i can already select this okay filter"
4735960,4749880," uh uh uh the fuck um okay one one thirty um e detail filter is not defined why are you saying that"
4753400,4775960," okay i'm starting to make typos i'm starting to make typos okay so we have that or you can select"
4775960,4783000," different things in here as you can see so and yeah all of that all of these like two things are"
4783000,4789400," separate components these are separate components cool uh the only problem we have in here is that"
4789400,4794600," on the first load it throws an error that there is no like texture in here and that's a huge problem in"
4794600,4801400," my opinion that's a huge problem so i suppose one of the things we need to do in here is um"
4802360,4809560," maybe like we do update images right so we need to be able to do something like an image filter selector"
4809560,4819320," um and maybe we need to specify like the first image right so ag image selector um so selected image"
4819320,4828200," right something like this um so filter selector is going to accept the image here oh you know what would be"
4828200,4835480," cooler maybe filter selector should accept the image selector and it will automatically wire everything"
4835480,4840760," there but that will actually couple them in one direction so maybe this it's not particularly great"
4840760,4849560," idea but yeah filter selector um so initial image right initial image data so that's what it's going to be called"
4850280,4863480," and uh image selector is going to introduce a method result"
4863480,4872600," selected image right so this is the selected image it's going to be a function that simply returns image"
4872600,4881720," preview so let's basically do this so it just exposes that thing for you simply exposes that thing through"
4881720,4892120," you selected image there we go so we have that filter selector then has initial image data and i'm pretty"
4892120,4900760," sure we don't need to do undefined here anymore um so what we essentially can do uh emote image emit"
4900760,4907160," initial image data and then we just create this thing like that"
4907160,4920600," to do that so we initialize everything first okay and everything seems to be okay so everything works"
4920600,4929880," that's fine i can now also select some of the values in here right and all that is automatically updated"
4929880,4937640," that is goddamn cool i really like that so yeah we separated yet another component in here"
4937640,4943320," we have separated yet another component and the way you wire up these two components is just like you"
4943320,4953000," create them uh right and you set up their events and event handlers and then um yeah you just put them"
4953000,4961720," on onto the dome and that's it so yeah they're completely isolated from each other so now we need to create"
4961720,4971160," the um renderer uh image so filter selector so this is for this image selector uh and"
4971160,4977320," the thing we're going to have in here is probably a gif uh renderer right so this is going to be a gif"
4977320,4983240," renderer so the gif renderer consists of different things in here right it consists actually in fact it"
4983240,4989080," consists of a button progress bar and this circular thingy and probably also download button"
4989080,4995800," right it consists of a lot of different things so this could be the whole its own components right"
4995800,5003800," this could be its own component and i i don't know maybe on a render it it's going to be emit an issue"
5003800,5009720," and whoever wires up things together it's going to handle this render issue and then send some signal to"
5009720,5015400," the filter selector filter selector filter selector will render everything for you because it's responsible"
5015400,5022280," for the for the gl context and whatnot right and that's pretty much it i guess i don't know"
5022280,5026120," that's how we're gonna handle all this"
5026120,5037800," we'll see so uh maybe we could split up components even further for instance maybe the progress bar could be"
5037800,5047160," its own component who knows who knows who knows uh we'll see we'll see so uh let me take a look at"
5047160,5054280," what would happen there i wonder if i can already integrate these things together i wonder if i can"
5054280,5061560," integrate them and get rid of some of this here so because if you press the render button right so we"
5061560,5066680," have a render button uh we're looking for gif uh so then we take a file"
5066680,5075880," uh so we all we need all of that to get like the file name and whatnot right but that could be"
5075880,5083640," actually extracted into the file selector we can add file selector a method that will actually like do all of that for us"
5083640,5094520," and then we call for a render and that could be a method of well depends render actually uh i think"
5094520,5102600," yeah it actually looks for these components and uh updates them and whatnot so it has like"
5103560,5113400," a state and a state and but for now it could be all right i think uh so render preview so unfinished"
5113400,5123880," uh render period preview does it try to access so okay so it only bites to be fair render is already"
5123880,5134520," like a render component by itself it encapsulates all four things in here okay"
5134520,5148920," uh i guess that makes sense uh we also have a gif um where's the render button button so we also have a gif"
5150280,5159240," it's undefined and then what do we use gif for why are we oh we need that to actually abort this entire"
5159240,5168520," thing i see and we're okay so that that could be actually also you know handled internally that could"
5168520,5177240," be also handled internally okay so i suppose yeah this is basically the renderer the gif renderer"
5178200,5182200," all right all right i want to make a small break before we're going to extract the render component"
5182200,5188040," and if we will be able to extract all three components uh maybe we'll be able to finally"
5188040,5195480," make a pull request and uh yeah finally decompose this entire thing somehow uh we'll see how it goes"
5195480,5197240," we'll see how it goes small break"
5200440,5210360," so um i don't really have that much time left so i have the following idea let's basically stop uh"
5210360,5218760," extracting the components and um leave the render components for later right so this is this is going"
5218760,5225160," to be a separate issue so what i want to try to do now i want to try to integrate both of these components"
5225160,5232760," back into the main page and wire them wire them up into the spaghetti that is a render the gif and uh"
5232760,5237320," for extracting the extracting the render again uh we're going to have a separate issue i think it's going"
5237320,5246680," to be a pretty good conclusion on today's stream so um so obviously like our framework doesn't really help us in"
5247240,5253800," developing these components uh but what it actually tell us uh is that we need some sort of"
5253800,5261000," more convenient mechanisms of sending information between uh the components right so we established a"
5261000,5265640," way of creating the components but now we want to actually send information between them and we need"
5265640,5268920," to figure out how to do that right now we're doing that through events and whatnot"
5269480,5276440," and that's a little a little bit cucumbersome but uh at least that tells us that we need to do something"
5276440,5283080," about that right so that's basically what it tells um so uh let me see what we can do in here"
5283080,5290440," so maybe for now uh i'm gonna actually just do a committee committee all right so greater integration"
5290440,5298600," right so this is what we're gonna have in here um all right so and in here what we did is extract uh"
5298600,5310120," image selector and filters selector uh greater components right so and i'm gonna push that and"
5310120,5314520," whether i'm gonna push that or not i i don't know maybe i'm not gonna push that because maybe somebody's"
5314520,5319960," watching my repos and it's gonna be spoiler for them of what i'm doing so let's not do that for now"
5319960,5328440," uh okay let's go to the on load for the window all right so we have a testing in here so this is"
5328440,5335960," the filter selector i already extracted that uh i also extracted that and i extracted that the canvas"
5335960,5348760," is extracted this thing is also extracted um yeah we also extracted that gif is quite important uh so yeah so"
5348760,5354440," here is the drag and drop and i'm not quite sure how we're gonna handle all that but i'm pretty sure"
5354440,5361080," we need a custom preview here so we need that we already extracted that to separate components"
5361080,5367880," uh all of that is also extracted drag and drop is not extracted yet but uh we'll have to do something"
5367880,5373720," about that and here is the render button here's the render button and that one is the most interesting one"
5373720,5381800," okay so um let me get rid of these things um so i'm gonna be moving this entire stuff in here"
5381800,5390360," uh mesh position mesh position is already extracted into a separate component and event loop is also"
5390360,5396360," already extracted so the point of extracting all these components is to reduce the size of this entire"
5396360,5401400," function right as you can see the size of this function became just this and it's going to become even"
5401400,5408840," smaller because we can probably extract these things somewhere maybe not um i've not decided yet but that"
5408840,5413880," will be actually kind of interesting uh so prevent default"
5416440,5422120," so i'm just thinking does it make sense to move it inside of the image selector or just keep it in"
5422120,5431800," here um that will be interesting so if we want to actually keep it in here maybe one of the things"
5431800,5440440," we'll have to do in here is just eg image selector uh and here we're gonna do something like um i don't know"
5440440,5448360," like update files right update files and we're gonna just like sending it in here and that's gonna be our event handler"
5448360,5454280," um and yeah maybe that that will do the trick uh i'm not sure yet"
5455720,5463480," um so let me let me see let me see all right"
5463480,5476120," so image selector filter selector we connect them together this is the entry we're gonna keep them in"
5476120,5480920," there uh we're gonna keep them in there uh we're gonna keep them in there and then we set everything up"
5482120,5490920," and here is the lebatone uh right so render button it's gonna be that uh so what we're doing here we're"
5490920,5504280," extracting um custom file path so this thing should be extracted to filter selector i think filter selector"
5508120,5513160," oh let's quickly do that um so we don't really have that much time so i don't know what i'm waiting"
5513160,5523800," for uh filter selector right so in here um this is not a filter selector or is it uh image selector"
5523800,5530600," that's what we need here so we have a selected image and in here we're gonna have a selected"
5532200,5542040," file file name yes selected file name this is what we're gonna call here so and essentially what we're"
5542040,5552760," doing um is so custom file i suppose custom file with input so that means we have to do something like"
5552760,5561560," image input we take the zeros one then uh if it's a file we remove extension otherwise uh we don't do anything"
5561560,5568680," okay so all right so that's what we want to have in here and now we can remove this entire thing and"
5568680,5578680," then here is going to be eg uh image selector selected uh file name and this is a function that we call in"
5578680,5587800," here there we go so uh selected file name and maybe it's it's pretty long thing so let's actually put it"
5587800,5595320," somewhere here it's going to cost file uh name like this and this is going to be file name there we go"
5595320,5602520," cool so we moved it inside we moved it inside it doesn't depend on any of this stuff so we also provide"
5602520,5608280," the canvas and the program and i'm not sure why do we need canvas in there i'm pretty sure we need the"
5608280,5615480," canvas in there for the size and whatnot so we don't really need uh canvas to modify something and call"
5615480,5621640," something on canvas uh let me actually see so if we take a look at the function render right so what do"
5621640,5632520," we use canvas for uh we literally use it only for the size oh my god come on uh and the size of the"
5632520,5640280," canvas is actually standard as it's actually fixed to 112 so we can quite easily get rid of this entire"
5640280,5646280," component and the only thing we'll need to have here is gl and program and we can extract them from the"
5646280,5655400," filter selector all right so that's actually pretty pretty uh promising i would say pretty pretty promising"
5655400,5663880," um so but i still want to like extract these like do something about this thing uh so this one is not going"
5663880,5671000," anywhere as you can see uh so i still want to do something about this one so it's it has something"
5671000,5681080," to do with the image selector it must have something to do with image selector all right uh update uh update"
5681080,5686600," files right so it's going to do something like that and we're just sending this thing in here and we're"
5686600,5694440," going to be moving there so image selector uh uh so here comes another function so selected image"
5694440,5702600," selected file name uh and uh here comes update files results update uh files"
5703880,5709160," certain function function function files and in here what we're doing essentially"
5709160,5715640," uh so call on change"
5715640,5725160," uh so we'll have to test all of that at some point but i'm not going to not be sure which input"
5727320,5735320," all right so this one is image input files so this is the files that we're sending in there and then"
5735320,5743400," we have to do image input on change and okay so let's do the same thing here on change as well"
5743400,5749080," some of the layers can be slightly different who knows and this one event we don't even use events"
5749080,5759560," from here so it's going to be like that uh to do so select um update files and whatnot all right so"
5759560,5765320," everything looks okay so these things kind of want to be classes but i'm not sure how to make classes that"
5765320,5773240," also expand existing nodes and whatnot so that's why i'm sort of like monkey patching them or if it"
5773240,5778920," makes any sense um all right so yeah when we do a drop we print this thing we"
5778920,5785240," update the files and then we do that thing uh all right so here's the render button um yeah now"
5785240,5792280," let me try to see what we have in here uh so function"
5792280,5797640," function render i'm thinking i'm going to do the following thing it's going to be canvas"
5797640,5807720," width 112 and canvas height right and in a function render we're never going to be actually sending this"
5807720,5814280," stuff and we're going to create a place canvas um you know what i'm going to create replacing it"
5814280,5820200," with the regular expression so it's going to be canvas dot and this one is going to be"
5820200,5827000," width or height right this can be width or height and we're going to be replacing this entire thing"
5827000,5836520," with canvas uh and i need to actually bring it to upper right so i remember emacs actually capable of doing that"
5837720,5846040," uh yeah yeah yeah i already googled it up yeah so essentially you can replace uh width to upper yeah"
5846040,5853960," yeah yeah this is what you can do in here this is actually super cool um so we can do slash comma"
5856120,5861800," like this um"
5861800,5868600," up case i suppose that's what i want to do in here right and it didn't work okay one more time uh i wonder why"
5868600,5874680," though i wonder why so this is probably because it wasn't captured properly probably so let's try to do"
5874680,5882680," uh something like this um i wonder if this kind of thing works so we want to have like a bunch of this"
5882680,5887720," okay and it it worked as you can see you can actually call functions but i screwed up a little bit"
5887720,5894520," right so i don't have to i think i don't have to put these things in here"
5895240,5901640," all right perfect look at that yes that's what you can do in emacs can your vim do that can your vim"
5901640,5906200," replace search and replace but also transform captured groups"
5906200,5913080," can you do that hmm i don't think so maybe vim cam like with enough extensions you can actually"
5913080,5918360," implement something like that uh but maybe it does have something like this uh by default without any"
5918360,5928600," additional stuff so um okay so render we need the canvas anymore but now we need to get gl and program"
5928600,5940360," from somewhere uh where can we get it from um to the fam to the fam the easiest way to do this kind of"
5940360,5948280," stuff would be to actually make a render a method of filter selector right so that's going to be the"
5948280,5956280," easiest thing to do just to make it a method of filter selector and let's see how it goes okay so filter"
5956280,5965240," selector so filter select is quite huge and let me find the function render so here's this entire stuff"
5965240,5974760," and uh let's actually literally move it there um so filter why emacs is selecting should filter selector"
5974760,5980920," okay um so here are where are the methods so we have update images and in here we're going to have"
5980920,5991000," something like result and it's going to be uh render render and we don't have to accept gl and program"
5991000,5997960," anymore right because we do have an access to these sticks to these things uh all of that is literally"
5997960,6007400," here so and we search for these components in here all right we search for them in here uh we update this"
6007400,6015560," entire stuff uh uh uh give on blah blah blah and this returns the give that you can then okay so this is"
6015560,6024760," fine all right so um yeah essentially we can do ag filter selector like this don't have to provide any of"
6024760,6033640," this stuff and there we go isn't that cool isn't that cool i think it's pretty cool so all right so we"
6033640,6044040," simplified the uh size of this like main entrance function um so i wonder if this entire thing is going to work"
6044040,6050920," i don't know we'll see we'll see so let me close everything in here let me close everything because"
6050920,6057000," i already opened too many things and it's going to be localhost 69 69 okay so we have these testing"
6057000,6065560," things uh nothing here works which is fine right and now if i try to okay let me open the console and"
6065560,6073000," see if we don't have any errors in here we don't see any errors i can change things around uh right and i can"
6073000,6082280," update the image and now can i try to render this entire thing and gl is not defined nice uh 1207"
6082280,6089320," uh but i never i never saved this entire thing of course okay yeah what i was testing i don't know"
6089320,6094840," what i was testing uh so let's actually test the default parameters in here right so none of that is"
6094840,6101160," working so that's fine uh let's try to render this entire thing and is it's doing something and it rendered"
6101160,6108040," successfully okay so can i download this thing it downloaded successfully um nothing much to complain"
6108040,6114120," about uh nothing much to complain about so now uh can i change this thing and i can change the"
6114120,6121720," this stuff right and uh let me try to render it one more time and it should render a different thing"
6121720,6128120," so is it's corresponding to that okay so that seems to be corresponding can i download this thing so if i've had"
6128120,6137000," gif so if i go here and find the five head gif and i open it in the chromium um of course do whatever you"
6137000,6144040," need to you need to do and seems to be working seems to be twerking okay so yeah apparently i reorganized"
6144040,6155320," everything and it didn't even break that much so i can also try to check the drag and drop situation uh so"
6156120,6163160," let's try this one let's try this one it didn't work it didn't work yay oh i mean it it actually worked"
6163160,6172440," okay okay okay so because now these are different things and everything works okay yeah okay okay"
6172440,6178760," very much okay also well it used to actually keep it"
6180680,6188600," with a particular size and i don't remember how i fixed that uh select an image select an image so"
6188600,6194600," um i don't know if i remember i think i fixed this size so here's the id custom preview i think i fixed"
6194600,6203720," it in css i think that's where i fixed it um custom preview yeah i just set the width to 112 okay so i can"
6203720,6214280," actually fix that in the js no big deal um image selector so we have an image preview so we have some"
6214280,6224520," shed in here and i might as well set oh my god what the hell is going on"
6224760,6241960," um emacs just work okay att uh width uh width and it's going to be canvas width there we go canvas"
6241960,6250680," width and now if i select a big file uh something like this uh it keeps it relative does it keep it a"
6250680,6256920," relatively small i don't know did it refresh things um so i need a big file i need a big boy file"
6256920,6265800," i didn't do okay so it's a it's a bit okay i'm already tired all right i'm already tired um i'm starting"
6265800,6274600," to make very stupid mistakes okay so it seems to be working all right so now what i need to do i need to"
6274600,6281400," place all of these components i need to place all these components in uh their corresponding places"
6281400,6288440," right so you see we have just dead uh dome elements in here these are the components that created uh using"
6288440,6293400," our frameworks but these things are dead so we need to get rid of them and we need to place something else"
6293400,6301320," in them uh well we need to specifically like uh how to say that deploy these elements in these sort of places"
6301320,6304600," so that's what we need to do um"
6312680,6319640," so we also i think i had to do for drag and drop which is not in it anymore uh yeah we already fixed"
6319640,6330280," that we already fixed it cute oh and by the way here i probably can do something like canvas uh width and"
6330280,6343160," canvas canvas so that's all we're gonna have in here so do we have one one two anywhere else okay so we're"
6343160,6352360," just depend on these constants now we just depend on these constants uh so drag and drop from anywhere"
6354120,6360520," all right so i'm just contemplating how i'm gonna start all that um okay"
6360520,6383640," extract uh renderer as the separate as a separate uh bridge js component similar to uh image selector"
6384600,6393080," and filter selector right image selector and filter selector so right now nothing is extracted in here"
6393080,6401640," uh nothing is extracted as a matter of fact the renderer is basically merged with the filter selector"
6401640,6408040," because they share a lot of information in there so that's right that's what that's what they need"
6410680,6416920," that's what they need in there uh all right so let's actually go into the index html let's go into the"
6416920,6423320," index html and in here i'm going to remove the testing uh section we don't have it anymore"
6423320,6428280," so this one is going to be rather interesting i think"
6430520,6437560," oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy so this entire thing um how can how we're gonna deploy all of this"
6437560,6448120," stuff um so maybe it's gonna be um i don't know just a regular div uh just a regular div with the id"
6449000,6458760," um image selector entry right something like this image selector entry so this is where we're gonna deploy"
6458760,6474120," all of that and um here comes the filter selector um filter selector entry and we're gonna put all these"
6474120,6494280," things in there so here's the uh here's that here is that uh we connect them together and the thing i'm"
6494280,6504200," i'm gonna do image selector entry and it's gonna be append child aj image selector"
6504200,6513320," then filter selector entry entry append child aj filter selector there we go"
6517880,6524760," so do we have is it is it working now it seems to be working now i don't see any problems right now so"
6524760,6532920," okay sure uh texture not bound i wonder why"
6532920,6544120," so it worked perfectly but now it doesn't work i wonder if this is because we need to sort of"
6545560,6548600," deploy this thing like this um"
6548600,6561400," i'm not quite sure like i mean it obviously it works now but something just doesn't work at the"
6561400,6570200," beginning right it cannot create the texture properly for the first time and uh filter selector on window load"
6571320,6573640," so and why they cannot do that"
6573640,6591800," we why can't this thing do that yet is that because it's i don't know"
6596040,6600200," um"
6600200,6604680," oh oh this is interesting one second"
6604680,6611800," still doesn't work so it just like needs some time"
6611800,6621480," to to load everything oh and this thing oh my god oh yeah i see i see i see i see i see i see"
6621480,6625320," yikes oh all right"
6625320,6635160," um because the selected image is not so i remember this kind of thing yeah yeah selected image is not"
6635160,6644920," selected is not selected yet um so what we can do in here so the image selector right image selector"
6647000,6654760," um when when when it loads everything right when this thing loads everything how we're gonna do with it"
6654760,6656760," um"
6656760,6660360," hmm"
6660360,6663400," well i don't know"
6663400,6668040," um i guess we need to go back to"
6670760,6679160," um having like undefined in programs and images inside of the filter selector"
6679160,6680840," um"
6680840,6685640," yeah we'll have to do something like that okay"
6690440,6695560," so filter select uh filter so basically here right"
6695560,6707720," oh actually i need to move filter changed up there"
6707720,6711720," just move it up there"
6713880,6720440," so update image is that and then if filter changed we do that"
6720440,6727240," um filter looks good to me"
6727240,6733000," so my idea is to bring this back to undefined"
6733000,6741640," and it's back to undefined until everything initialized what's interesting is that when we're rendering"
6741640,6745880," everything i suppose we shouldn't even try to"
6745880,6757080," maybe do the actual draw unless we have a program all right so here we are basically"
6757080,6763640," just setting the background color then if we have a program we set the uniforms if we have an image we"
6763640,6768520," set the uniforms for the image and then we draw so as far as i know if you don't have a valid program"
6768520,6777400," you won't be able to even draw so um yeah i guess that's fine that is fine so because of that we"
6777400,6784280," don't need initial image data right initial image data is not even used anywhere anymore so it's going"
6784280,6789240," to be initialized as soon as possible as soon as you get a filter or as soon as you get an image"
6790120,6794120," everything is going to be there but for the for the program to be fair"
6794120,6801000," we could load the program with the selected filter so it's not really neat"
6801000,6813560," for the program all right so that means i can do something like filter list filter list selected"
6816040,6820760," filter i think that's what it is so i can do that for the program but for the image i will have to wait"
6820760,6830920," until it's uh loaded up all right so here i create this image thingy then i create the filter right filter"
6830920,6839160," selector then i connect them together and then i'm adding them to this entire stuff maybe i'm going to add"
6839160,6844040," the filter first and then the image and as far as i can understand once i add the image it will perform"
6844040,6850520," the query uh it will perform the query query the image and then unload it will send the uh event image"
6850520,6857080," selected i guess that's how it's going to work all right so we have to be a little bit more agile in"
6857080,6864760," this particular case and uh okay so there is no texture bound to well i mean that's understandable"
6864760,6869400," that is understandable that there is no texture bound to anything yet"
6869400,6879240," uh and i wonder if that's a big problem in here to be fair render warning well at first"
6881160,6890200," uh all right it still tries to do that even though there is no image okay image texture"
6890200,6896360," okay here's my idea let's actually do it like this"
6896360,6906440," we're gonna l uh we're gonna render things only if we have a valid program and a valid image okay i think"
6906440,6911480," you think that's fair enough right um until everything is loaded up we don't even try to"
6911480,6919800," do any of these things right and of course it works right it in fact works isn't that exciting i think"
6919800,6926200," it's goddamn exciting all right so in here i can just render this entire thing um all right all right"
6926200,6933400," all right and i can select some other things so let's actually try the uh drag and drop drop seems"
6933400,6942680," to be working uh different filters um loading rendering uh something like this in here let's"
6942680,6950120," also render one more time and i guess it is working right so we extracted everything and"
6950120,6958520," decoupled everything uh into separate components right so now these things are their own components um"
6959560,6965800," accept the renderer though but i mean we will work on that so that was very educational i would say"
6965800,6973400," because uh by using this small framework i now gathered enough information to understand what framework"
6973400,6979400," needs and from here i can clearly see that you need to be able to send somehow signals between the"
6979400,6986440," components and right now we're using events but for some reason uh this kind of you know"
6987160,6995800," reminds me of like a cute signal and slots i wonder if we can take the idea of cute signal and slots and"
6995800,7003480," adapt it for our framework so you could just have like these things could become um well i mean something"
7003480,7011800," like update image like update files right this something like this could become a slot and um something that"
7011800,7016040," creates um creates um like updated file signal could be become a signal and you can just connect them"
7016040,7021560," together somehow all right that would be interesting actually you know some inspiration from cute but i"
7021560,7028040," don't know yet it's just like a random random thoughts that i'm having um it's just a random thoughts that i'm"
7028040,7037880," having um so let's actually do a committee going to uh to to to to to to so extract blah blah blah"
7037880,7052360," um integrate uh image selector and filter selector into the main application right into the main application"
7052360,7062840," all right so uh did they create to do ci a create on the one to do all right so let's create a pull request"
7063480,7074680," um so it's gonna be emote emote jam and now the jam did i didn't remember if i pushed it okay so i need"
7074680,7077400," to push it first before i can even create a pull request"
7081160,7082760," compare and compare and pull request"
7082760,7092600," grecia js integration that's what it is so how many changes did we make we didn't even make that many"
7092600,7102120," changes right like that many changes but we definitely i think uh improved this situation more or less"
7102120,7109320," and you know what we added a couple of things into the framework so i think it would make sense to"
7109320,7117480," contribute them back right uh so let's copy paste this into i think i replace it and so this is the thing"
7117480,7128520," that we added all right so we added select mundane tag and input tag okay uh add uh select and input tag"
7128520,7134920," you see it's a very lightweight framework it's almost like having no framework at all and i want to keep it"
7134920,7143080," that way uh i really want to keep it that way so it's like very very very thin layer um all right so"
7143080,7151400," yeah we did it we actually did it we extracted these things into their own components and it's working"
7151400,7158680," fine um we'll accept this thing but we're gonna work in that later all right thanks everyone who's watching"
7158680,7163880," right now we really appreciate it have a good one and i see you on the next offline session"
7163880,7171400," on the next offline session so i'm gonna be back on twitch on um probably on june 12th"
7171400,7179880," but i can't promise anything it just depends on my on my state at that particular date so yeah maybe see"
7179880,7187640," you all live on on june 12th we'll see we'll see uh thanks everyone for watching love you"
