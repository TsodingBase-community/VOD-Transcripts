800,6400," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session"
6400,13520," with Azuzan let's make a little bit a tiny bit of an announcement and officially start the stream"
13520,21280," as usual as usual so uh we're gonna do a red circle uh red circle live on twitch and what"
21280,29200," are we doing today on twitch adopt a television website today we are um yeah we're doing a little"
29200,37840," bit of a proof like i don't even know how to explain that but we are uh proving uh arithmetical"
37840,44240," theorems right so specifically we're going to be proving this statement which is basically this"
44240,50240," sum the square of sum uh right so the usual formula that quite famous formula so we're going to be"
50240,54640," proving that but we're not going to be just proving that we're going to prove in that we're going to be"
54640,62160," proving that from the very beginning from the very beginning using piano axioms uh right so i'm going"
62160,67360," to give the link to where we're doing all that uh twitch.tv/todding and i'm going to ping everyone"
67360,73760," who's interested in being pinged at this time and there we go the stream has officially started the"
73760,81200," stream has officially started uh all right so to do that to do that we're going to be using knock uh which"
81200,87280," is a very old project of mine i think i actually started to develop that project like two years ago"
87280,93120," uh right so i started to develop two years ago and then i uh basically put it on pause right so i never"
93120,99920," abandoned my project okay so people have a perception people been spreading misinformation that i never"
99920,106880," finished my project and i abandoned them i never abandoned my project i put them on pause i pause them then"
106880,113600," i research and work on something else and i go back to them and this is the proof of that right so it's"
113600,118720," not the first time when i actually went back to an old project of mine and continue just developing it"
118720,124800," right so i can continue developing any of my project at any moment right i never abandoned them they never"
124800,133280," abandoned they're just paused okay so we're on the same page so it's an old project of mine and um yeah so i"
133280,140240," i decided to revisit it again uh the reason i decided to revisit it again is because i've been doing like"
140240,145680," a very simple recreational math at my spare time like at my spare time sometimes i like to play with"
145680,153280," expressions and stuff like that and i just started to prove things starting from the piano axioms right"
154640,162560," and uh then i realized that um a lot of things uh that can be proven starting from piano axioms like"
162560,167600," different uh different properties of sum and multiplication and stuff like that they could be"
167600,175600," proven uh using mathematical induction and then i got a stroke of genius i can actually do a mathematical"
175600,183280," induction in knock even though i never explicitly programmed it to do that which is rather interesting"
183280,189600," i can do mathematical induction in this thing but i never explicitly said like this is how you do that"
189600,196960," so i just realized that and that realization actually enabled the whole array of tools to prove a lot of"
196960,202880," things in a very powerful way and that's exactly what i would like to explore today right so and we're"
202880,209280," going to be using this the the square of some formula as sort of like a playground to uh to explore these"
209280,217760," ideas to explore this tool so to speak so uh let's go ahead and go into the repo of knock and see"
217760,224400," how we can use all that right so the main thing in knock is its ripple you basically do everything"
224400,232320," through ripple uh right so but ripple is not particularly very uh very powerful we are working"
232320,237280," on a better ripple but it's in a very intermediate state so it's not particularly usable right now"
237280,243120," so one of the things uh i usually recommend while using this ripple is to use a rel wrap which basically"
243120,248960," adds a read line interface to to this entire thing right so for instance it allows you to do ctrl b"
248960,254720," ctrl f and navigate and stuff like that and also it allows you to look through the history and search"
254720,261040," for the history even though i never actually explicitly coded any of that stuff into the ripple so you can"
261040,268320," still do that by using rl wrap right so and essentially what do you have in here you can have some sort"
268320,273920," of expressions right so you can have some sort of expressions like a plus b so and what you can do with"
273920,279760," the expression you can for instance shape it right so you can just go ahead and shape it so i think it's"
279760,284800," a little bit more interesting expression would be a plus b uh multiplied by c right so that's a little"
284800,291520," bit more interesting and you started shaping the expression so what you can do what what is shaping"
291520,299280," what is essentially shaping shaping is basically providing a pattern a certain pattern and replacing that"
299280,306960," specific pattern with something else for example you want to swap uh the operands of specifically"
306960,314400," plus separation but not multiplication what you can say okay a plus b uh with a capital letter we denote"
314400,320480," a variables they're going to be that can capture a specific sub-expressions and you're going to say okay"
320480,328640," v replace that with b plus a right and uh then you have to put a bar in here and after the bar you have to"
328640,337040," specify the uh replacement strategy and uh the usual replacement strategy that i use is basically all"
337040,343920," so essentially it is going to recursively traverse this entire ast and every time uh something matches"
343920,348400," this specific pattern it's going to apply that pattern and replace it with this kind of thing so that's"
348400,354960," basically strategy of all means uh there are different other strategies for example you can uh replace uh the"
354960,361440," zeroes match or the first match the second and so on and so forth you can basically enumerate all of the"
361440,367360," matches as it traverses the stuff but usually you want to do all and as you can see it actually swapped"
367360,375920," these two things so that's basically shaping that is shaping so um interestingly enough"
376960,384320," you um you um can actually assign different sort of rules of the shaping to some sort of names right so"
384320,391520," for example this is some commutativity right so we define the rule some commutativity uh there we go"
391520,399440," here is the rule and uh we can just literally apply just that rule and we swapped it again and then we can"
399440,406400," finish the uh the shaping so this is what it allows you to do this is what it allows you to do uh so"
406400,414080," interestingly enough um you can have a lot of different rules and one of the usual um example that"
414080,422560," uh i do is this formula of the uh square of sum right so the square of sum so let's actually try to"
422560,428960," um sort of like prove the square of sum so we can we're gonna have something like a plus b uh right"
428960,436880," square right and what's interesting is that you can uh define rules you can define rules through shaping"
436880,443040," right so here what we did we just did the shaping uh where did we start the shape we just did the"
443040,447840," shaping of some expression as soon as we finished the shaping nothing really happened and we just forgot"
447840,453360," about it but you can actually save the shaping you can take the shaping and assign it to a particular"
453360,460240," name and the result of that shaping is going to become uh the new rule that you can use in other"
460240,466480," shapings right so let's actually define a rule sum uh of square right sum of square and start shaping this"
466480,472400," entire thing start shaping this entire thing right the first thing we need to do we need to sort of like"
472400,478800," expand uh this square right so uh let's actually say okay so square is essentially"
478800,484960," something like this right so this is basically the definition of square if you have some variable a"
484960,491680," that is squared it is equal to a multiplied by a so that's basically how we understand the square"
491680,497840," right so we can define this entire thing and we can apply this thing and as you can see we expanded"
497840,506400," this entire stuff we just expanded it so uh now what we can apply we can apply the uh sum would"
506400,513440," multiplication distribution right so essentially a multiplied by b plus c is equal to a multiplied"
513440,519760," by b plus a multiplied by c so this is basically the distribution that is defined on addition and"
519760,526960," multiplication so let's actually call this thing multiplication sum uh distribution right sum distribution"
527600,533200," there we go we define this rule and then we can go ahead and apply this entire thing to our current"
533200,541760," shaping and this is what we got so we literally mechanically transforming the expressions we literally"
541760,547760," mechanically transforming them so we could try to apply the multiplication distribution one more time"
547760,553200," uh right but it's not going to work because there is no match for that right so we have this"
553200,560800," multiplication but the uh the distribution assumes a to be on the left side it assumes it to be on the left"
560800,567120," side so what we have to do we have to apply the sum commutativity right so the sum commutativity is"
567120,572640," basically actually not the sum commutativity it's multiplication commutativity right because we want to"
572640,579600," swap around specifically uh for multiplication right and that property that property is a multiplied by b"
579600,585680," equal to b multiplied by a uh right so then we can go ahead and apply this entire stuff like so"
585680,590560," and as you can see it actually swapped this is what we have and ahead well this is what we have now"
590560,597520," which allows me to apply the sum distribution and boom this is what we got this is what we got"
598320,603040," so interestingly enough so interestingly enough we have a multiplied by a and b multiplied by b"
603040,612000," uh right and we already defined um um a rule square right but it goes in a different direction"
612000,618080," right so it's basically transform a to the power of two to a multiplied by a but here we have an opposite thing"
618080,622160," um so what we can do we can actually apply the square"
622800,630640," but in reverse so any of the rules can be applied in a forward direction and in a backward direction"
630640,636480," right if you have one rule defined like that you can apply it the other way right and there you go"
636480,641680," we actually transformed a multiplied by e to i a to a squared and the same with b"
643760,652640," so that's pretty cool uh so i would like to maybe swap around b and a so uh these two things are equal"
652640,657280," to each other so to do that what do we need we need a multiplication commutativity so here's a"
657280,663840," multiplication commutativity and specifically we need to apply that to this second uh multiplication so"
663840,668320," they're actually indexed uh starting from zero so if you want to apply it to the second one you have to"
668320,676880," provide one uh there we go and here we have these two things we could probably define something like um"
676880,685840," so we already have square we could have actually create something like a double where you say um a"
685840,692480," 2a is equal a plus a right it's kind of similar to square but it's with the different operations in here"
692480,699200," so we could try to do something like that and try to apply double to all but there is no matching here"
699200,706320," right because these two things they're on opposite sort of parentheses they're not directly the operands"
706320,713440," of the plus what we'll have to do we'll have to shuffle around the parentheses to make them appear"
713440,720240," within the same parentheses right so to be able to do that we need another law uh and now it's not really"
720240,726960," law it's like theorem but maybe it's you can call it a law uh which is the sum associativity do you guys"
726960,736000," know what is the sum associativity uh right it's essentially a plus b plus c equal to a plus b plus c"
736000,745120," so this is the sum associativity um right so and now we should basically carefully shuffle things around"
745120,751680," so i suppose we can just apply some associativity on the very first top thing in here okay so that seems"
751680,759200," to be working so now i want to uh transform this thing uh into this thing so that means i'll need to"
759200,767760," apply some associativity in reverse but on the i suppose in the first one as well"
768960,775120," i can actually undo and try this one there we go so as you can see we just shuffled around the"
775120,780320," parenthesis we just shuffled around and we actually brought both of these opera both of these things"
780320,786880," into like a same parenthesis and now we should be able to do double in reverse and this is what we've got"
787520,794400," and we just proved the formula of this sum of the square and now this entire thing became one of the"
794400,803120," definitions right so right we just started with that we defined a bunch of sort of like laws which we"
803120,809600," apply them and transform them and now this thing is a new rule that you can use for instance if you have"
809600,818320," something like a plus b multiplied by c uh and then this is squared and you want to shape it you can just"
818320,826320," apply this entire thing that we proved kind of proved directly and it will apply it as you would expect it"
826320,836320," right so uh there you go and uh we have this as a bunch of uh like definitions and stuff like that and"
836320,843520," you know what's cool you know what's cool you can save all of these definitions to uh square of sum dot"
843520,849600," no like this you can quit it and if you take a look at what you have in here you have this file uh that you"
849600,857360," can open with vim and here are all of the definitions that we have in here right so here they are and like"
857360,864640," it also preserves the log and stuff like that and what you can do you can start the ripple yet again"
864640,870960," you can start the ripple yet again and load uh some of uh square of some"
870960,879760," square of some uh like so right it will reevaluate everything again right it will trace all the"
879760,883840," transformation and you can basically continue working with the definitions"
883840,891200," this is knock basically this is demo of knock so what do you guys think"
893040,898640," uh right so it's a very simple thing it's not supposed to be a proof assistant"
898640,904640," it's not supposed to be proof assistant and actually emphasize on that uh right so it's not"
904640,911120," a cog it's just transforming expressions that's what it does it's simply transforming expressions"
911120,916720," according to certain patterns and defining rules that is it it is not supposed to be proof assistant or"
916720,922640," anything like that it's just simply that but with simply that you can do a lot of interesting things"
922640,928720," already you can do a lot of interesting things so you can say that we can we kind of already proved"
928720,935200," uh the the formula the original formula that i you know said that i'm going to prove at the beginning of"
935200,943920," the stream but it's not a complete proof it is not a complete proof we basically assumed all of these things"
943920,952080," things right we basically like declared them them axiomatically uh but these are very complex axioms"
952080,961760," these are very complex axioms so uh a better axioms would be something like piano axioms right so piano axioms"
961760,972320," are basically the lowest level of arithmetics right so piano axioms so there's like nine of them"
972320,978320," but they're very very simple uh they're very very simple so there's a wikipedia uh page wikipedia article"
978320,983360," sorry for flash banging you i'm going to put it in here and of course for people who's potentially"
983360,990720," watching on youtube uh i'm going to put it here as well so uh right so there's nine of them and they're"
990720,996880," very very very primitive they're very very very simple for example one of them is zero is a natural"
996880,1006480," number this is the axiom right so for every natural number x x is equal to x that is equality that is"
1006480,1012880," equality is reflexive so we're talking about this level of axioms right reflexivity"
1013600,1020400," natural number and stuff like that so symmetrical so the equals are symmetrical and everything a lot of"
1020400,1028880," them are not particularly like directly expressible in um in knock right because they're talking about"
1028880,1035600," uh the set of natural numbers and if one thing is in the set of natural number and if they're equal"
1035600,1040080," another thing is also in the set of natural numbers we can't really talk about these kind of things"
1040080,1046160," uh right but one of the theorems the most important theorem for us is going to be"
1046160,1052160," probably reflexivity it's going to be very very useful and another thing that uh piona axioms define"
1052160,1060400," they define a successor operator a successor operator uh so and to get the feeling of the successor operator"
1060400,1066560," is uh you can take a look at the following example you have a number two and if you apply a successor"
1066560,1073360," on number two that is equal to three so it basically increments it by one and the idea of"
1073360,1081600," so-called piano numbers is basically to represent numbers with the amount of s's"
1082560,1098080," right so essentially you have s of s of zero and this is one you have s of s of zero and this is two"
1098080,1104080," and you have s of s of s and this is three so essentially you represent numbers with the amount of s's"
1104880,1113120," right so this is how you represent them so and representing numbers like that is actually enough"
1113120,1118560," to prove all of these properties and then eventually prove that sum of squares is equal to that"
1118560,1125600," right and this is what i want to do today this is what i want to try to do today so a lot of these"
1125600,1132240," properties uh can be actually proven using mathematical induction right and we're going to see how you can"
1132240,1139360," uh prove things with mathematical induction in knock right because so far what we saw we saw only direct"
1139360,1145200," proof right so in in case of a sum of squares we just took the expression and we transformed it into"
1145200,1151520," a different expression and that is basically a direct proof uh right so if we load can i just do something"
1151520,1158640," like load of squares right so and i show sum of square uh right so as you can see this is the sequence"
1158640,1166480," of steps that we had to take to actually like directly prove this thing um right so uh let's actually start"
1166480,1174800," from scratch i'm going to actually remove square of sum and uh let's try to define the operation of"
1174800,1178880," addition right operation of addition of the piano numbers"
1182000,1188880," right so let's define something like sum id which is essentially uh zero plus a equal a"
1188880,1195520," right so it's sort of like zero is a neutral element it's it's id element i think i think it's basically"
1195520,1204320," id element of of the sum operation um so this is pretty straightforward um so and then let's define"
1204320,1213920," sort of like um recursive step of the sum right so i put zero at the first apparent intentionally because"
1213920,1223520," i plan i plan to use the first operand as the counter so to speak right so if i have plus a plus b"
1223520,1231120," the first thing i want to do i want to kind of strip off the s from from a right so because of"
1231120,1237600," that i'm going to match this thing against this specific pattern which will effectively strip off"
1237600,1243680," one s layer from that specific operand right and essentially what i'm going to do i'm going to do"
1243680,1249760," sort of like a recursive call to the plus operation right so i'm going to say that this kind of operation"
1249760,1260240," is equal to uh s but a plus b so i'm taking that sort of layer of s and sort of like um um hooking uh"
1260240,1268640," around b right so and i'm basically grouping these two layers of s's together into a single one and"
1268640,1275200," that is basically an addition it's kind of like a hand wavy explanation but luckily with the knock you'll be"
1275200,1281600," able to literally see how it goes about right for instance uh like we just defined a sum operation"
1281600,1287280," right so i want to add together uh two plus three right maybe three plus two because uh we are using"
1287280,1292560," the first operand as the counter so it's going to be more operation so it's going to be more spectacular"
1292560,1300640," uh maybe we can even say it as the as the element uh right as the sum test as the rule so we can basically"
1300640,1306640," replay it and see how it goes uh right so unfortunately we cannot work with these symbols"
1306640,1311840," directly we can't really work with these symbols directly we need to convert them to the piano"
1311840,1319840," numbers right so let's actually define some rules like uh three is equal to uh this thing right three s's"
1319840,1326080," right so this is the first thing and let's define two as uh something like like this it's two s's"
1326800,1332560," right so we have this expression let's basically uh like apply this rule to that and this rule to that"
1332560,1339760," and there we go we got um this sort of thing right and now uh we can clearly see we can clearly see that"
1339760,1345760," we can apply some rule to this specific expression right so let's actually go ahead and apply it and see"
1345760,1354480," what's going to happen as you can see we took this uh like upper layer of s and put it around the second"
1354480,1361040," operand like this and we can do that one more time so that happened with the internal one and one more"
1361040,1369920," time and we ended up with this pattern which actually is the same pattern as some id and so that means we"
1369920,1375040," can just apply some id and we ended up with a number with five s's"
1377680,1383840," so but the original expression was three plus two so we can also define something like uh five equal to"
1383840,1391440," uh to that right so we can also define five equal to that uh right and we can we can apply that in"
1391440,1397200," reverse and we get five we're gonna close that and we can take a look at some test and we basically"
1397200,1399520," demonstrated that three plus two is equal to five"
1401600,1411040," right so this is how mechanically the sum operation works using piano axioms right so"
1411040,1418480," when you def when you define natural numbers like that you can mechanically define uh some operations"
1418480,1425040," on a very low level right we're talking about very low level of math this is assembly of math"
1425920,1430400," right this is assembly of math nobody really thinks about arithmetics like that"
1430400,1436080," but to actually have complete proofs of all of these things of all of the like properties of"
1436080,1440720," numbers and stuff like that you need to go very low level and start thinking in terms of this like"
1440720,1446880," sort of like um you know successor operators right so and that's exactly what we're doing"
1447760,1452880," uh that is exactly what we're doing all right so let's actually save whatever we have in here i want"
1452880,1459040," to save that to uh piano knock right so save that to piano knock and in fact i would like to maybe"
1459040,1465840," open this in a text editor and maybe rearrange some things right so because we were defining them in"
1465840,1470640," whatever order we need them but i don't really want them to be in that specific order i would like"
1470640,1476880," to put these sort of things at the top and maybe define them in an increasing order of the numbers that"
1476880,1483120," would make a little bit more sense uh right so and i'm gonna save this entire thing and i'm gonna"
1483120,1490320," reopen this stuff and load the piano again right so and there we go so everything seems to be working"
1490320,1495600," this is not test this is list there we go so and they are in this order so you can basically at any"
1495600,1502560," moment like save your current work and go in with the text editor change something and load it back again"
1503200,1508240," right so this is actually very useful uh this is actually very useful"
1508240,1518960," so what's interesting is that um if you have something like 0 plus x right 0 plus x you can quite"
1518960,1526960," easily apply some id and get a final x right so that works but what's interesting is that you can't do"
1526960,1533520," that you literally can't do that at all uh right so if you try to apply some id"
1533520,1539600," there is no match right because the zero is at the left side right so left hand side"
1539600,1543360," and reverse is not going to help you either well i mean okay"
1546400,1552720," that is funny that is funny actually uh right so essentially what it did it took the whole expression"
1552720,1556880," well i mean technically it reversed it i mean technically it reversed it because if you take a"
1556880,1564240," look at the uh look at the definition right it's just anything plus zero right is equal to that so"
1564240,1569600," anything it took the whole expression and just added zero which is i mean technically correct uh so which"
1569600,1577280," means that i can apply this thing yet again and it will bring back to to that um right so if we had"
1577280,1583200," uh some commutativity uh we could easily demonstrate that they're equivalent we could just apply the"
1583200,1590320," commutativity but we don't have a some commutativity we can't swap things around right so we can't swap"
1590320,1596640," things around so we have to work without this in test so but uh what's interesting is that i would"
1596640,1604960," argue that it is uh more than enough uh to have these two sort of axioms and probably another axiom"
1604960,1613040," from piano axioms to demonstrate that a plus zero is equal to a as well so let's actually call it some id"
1613600,1622160," commutative right so and how can we prove this thing how can we prove um"
1622160,1635200," um so i'm not a mathematician i know it's a weird thing to say after you what you just saw but i'm not"
1635200,1640880," a mathematician right i do not consider myself mathematician and i know almost nothing about math"
1641760,1651760," but uh one way i see you can prove that using these uh things is through mathematical induction"
1651760,1658720," through mathematical induction right so do you guys know what what is a mathematical induction"
1658720,1662240," mathematical induction"
1662240,1669920," so mathematical induction it's a basically a way of proving"
1669920,1674720," uh a particular statements on all of the sequence so i think the definition wikipedia is better"
1674720,1680720," is method of proving that's a statement p of n is true for every natural number n"
1680720,1687920," right uh that is infinitely many cases p of zero p of one p of uh two and so on and so forth am i"
1687920,1697280," going to actually put this thing here uh right and i'm going to put this thing here as well so how can we use"
1697280,1706480," a mathematical induction uh in here as you can see we have one variable a one variable a we can prove that"
1706480,1715600," this uh equivalence holds for a equal zero for a equal one for a equal two equal a equal three and so on"
1715600,1722960," and so forth to the infinity right so yeah if we can manage to do that we effectively proved this thing"
1722960,1729440," we effectively prove this thing so uh how can we do that so uh how can we do that so let me see so usually"
1729440,1737840," you do that by defining uh two things by defining two things the base of the induction right so uh let's"
1737840,1743120," call it the base so this is the base of the induction and uh so our statement the statement that we're trying"
1743120,1753280," to prove is a plus zero uh equal uh a right equal a so i didn't make a mistake here so the base of this"
1753280,1761840," induction the base of this induction is going to be a equal to zero right so uh let's just put uh zero into a"
1761840,1769440," so what we end up with is zero plus zero equal zero so this is a trivial case this is the trivial case"
1769440,1777200," because we can just use the sum id we can just use the sum id that we had in here to demonstrate"
1777200,1784400," to demonstrate that this entire thing is equal to zero so and there we go we we actually demonstrated"
1784400,1793440," that the base case holds the base case holds so and the second thing you do you define so-called"
1793440,1800480," induction step you define so-called induction step uh right within the induction step"
1801680,1810800," um your variable your variable is actually equal to s a right so your variable is equal to that"
1810800,1819360," uh so and what you're trying to prove you're trying to prove this specific case you're trying to prove"
1819360,1826480," this specific case but since you already proved the base you can kind of assume you can kind of assume"
1826480,1835120," that uh this case is already proven you can already assume that this case is already proven the case from"
1835120,1843840," the previous the previous case right so uh what you can do in here what you can do in here you can take"
1843840,1849600," the sum definition right you can take the sum definition that we already had in here so this is the sum"
1849600,1856240," definition and as you can see it actually matches uh perfectly with this thing so that means we can"
1856240,1864560," rewrite this entire thing uh as that as that and since i already said the previous case"
1864560,1873120," is true for us already we can just use this thing to rewrite this entire thing like that and we just"
1873120,1880560," proved the induction step we just proved the induction step so we proved the base the basis holds for this thing"
1880560,1886000," and the induction step which assumes that the previous step is also true also holds so we just proved"
1886000,1893040," that this is true as well using just these two definitions so we just demonstrated that with a"
1893040,1900960," mathematical induction uh right so that's basically what it is as basically what it is but how can you"
1900960,1912000," do that do that in the knock how can you do that in knock well you can actually directly define these two"
1912000,1919040," statements these two things uh in knock uh in knock there is an interesting operator called equals equals"
1919040,1928000," and uh you can basically use it in expressions right so you can use it in expressions like so uh right so you"
1928000,1936400," can start shaping this thing and then you can say a equal b uh equal to b equal a so it's quite important to"
1936400,1942960," distinguish equals equals equals equals and equals right so equals equals equals is part of the expression"
1942960,1949200," language uh right so it's basically on the same level as things like plus uh multiplication division and so"
1949200,1957360," on and so forth and equals is a special um operator for the command language to separate left hand side and"
1957360,1964800," right hand side of the rule substitution thing uh right so you can for example apply it like that so and there you go you just"
1964800,1971840," uh transform this expression so you can use equals equals in your expressions which means that you can"
1971840,1980160," basically try to transform logical statements right you can try to transform logical statements for instance"
1980160,1988880," you can take this thing and turn it into a logical statement right so uh right so the base of our"
1989520,1994800," uh induction is going to be a equal to zero let's actually substitute this thing right and let's call"
1994800,2003040," this specific rule the base let's call it the base so what we can do in here we can as already said again"
2003040,2010640," apply uh the sum id directly in here right so if you take a look some id actually fits perfectly to this"
2010640,2016400," definition so we can just do some id uh like so and now we have zero equal to zero"
2017520,2028240," and here is an interesting thing uh piano axioms piano axioms have a very interesting axiom called reflexivity"
2028240,2043520," where is the reflexivity yeah x equal x equal x is a true statement right it is a true statement uh so"
2044320,2052800," who said we can't define the following thing uh if thing is equal to itself this is a true statement"
2052800,2059040," this is a true statement okay so we have this we have reflexivity"
2059040,2066640," we just proved that this statement is true"
2067440,2072000," by mechanically transforming it and using the reflexivity axiom"
2072000,2074560," so"
2074560,2077680," you see what i'm talking about"
2077680,2084800," now we can try to prove uh the induction step"
2084800,2092080," the induction step so in the case of the induction step so a becomes like uh like incremented"
2092800,2100000," and this is an expression right and uh we just apply the sum definition like so"
2100000,2108560," and since we're in an induction step the previous uh step is true which means that we can use this thing"
2108560,2118640," to prove the induction step and then apply reflexivity yet again so we have the original statement"
2119680,2124480," and we have the proof of that statement as separate two statements like this"
2124480,2128800," right look at that so this is the original statement"
2128800,2136240," and these are two other statements that sort of prove inductively that this one is true and the induction"
2136240,2141760," step uses this one because it assumes that this one is true because we already proved the previous one"
2141760,2150560," is that cool right so essentially you can basically sort of like supply proof to other statements like like this"
2150560,2154240," that makes sense it makes sense"
2154240,2160160," so and yeah we essentially prove this entire thing so i actually want to open this entire stuff"
2160160,2169360," uh and uh maybe put a reflexivity i want to put reflexivity like at the very top because it's a very fundamental axiom"
2169840,2176800," and uh reflexivity is very important axiom like in fact you can't prove anything in math"
2176800,2185200," uh without that axiom like you can't prove anything other like if you don't assume that because nothing"
2185200,2191120," makes sense because you won't be able to do this last step you won't be able to do this last step"
2193040,2200400," right and there we go so we can just basically keep abusing this mathematical induction and prove all of"
2200400,2206880," the possible properties of the uh you know of the arithmetic operations right so this is commutativity"
2206880,2215520," only of uh sum id but can we prove the commutativity of sum in general the commutativity of sum i think that"
2215520,2220080," will be interesting so let's actually go ahead and try to do that uh all right i'm gonna load the piano"
2220080,2229360," again so there we go um all right so sum commutativity right we know that it's a plus b equal b plus a"
2229360,2238160," cool but we said that axiomatically who the are we to say that axiomatically"
2239600,2246080," we have to prove that and we can prove that again using mathematical induction right so let's actually"
2246080,2252480," do induction by by a we can pick whatever variable we can pick b but i think using a is going to be a"
2252480,2258880," little bit easier right because the sum is defined uh using the left one as the counter so i feel like"
2258880,2264560," it's going to be easier if we just do induction by a uh right so let's say it's a base uh right we"
2264560,2270880," transform that into an expression and uh we're going to start with a equal to zero right can we prove"
2270880,2279520," that this statement is true can we prove that let's see uh sum id easy boom and look at that we need to"
2279520,2284640," do sum id but the other way around and we already proved that in sum id commutative"
2286640,2293600," okay so and uh we can just do reflexivity boom easy gg easy we just prove the base"
2293600,2300240," but that's only the base right that's only the base now we need to do the inductive step"
2300240,2307200," right so let's do the inductive step so and in inductive step a becomes incremented by one"
2307200,2314000," and within the index step you are allowed to use some comb because it's a previous step right so uh let's"
2314000,2318960," go ahead and just put this thing in here so what kind of stuff can we use in here well obviously we"
2318960,2326080," can use some just the sum definition right just the sum definition so let's just apply uh the sum in here"
2326080,2333360," okay so that's pretty cool um so what else can we do in here"
2334560,2342320," um as i already said we can use some commutativity within the inductive step so that means we can"
2342320,2348560," uh swap around this thing right we can literally swap around this thing so this one is going to be"
2348560,2355120," zeros one this one is going to be first one there we go and after we swapped it around it fits perfectly"
2355120,2364240," into the definition of sum so we can just apply sum yet again"
2364240,2374560," freaking proved whoa wait a second and i've been watching the vote back and i realized that there's"
2374560,2380880," something wrong with this entire trickery right even though we're inside of the sum commutative inductive"
2380880,2388800," step and we can assume that sum comb is true for that specific step this is not how you allowed to"
2388800,2396000," apply it right so we applied it to this expression but we are only allowed to apply to this expression"
2396000,2402400," something doesn't add up we can't just apply this thing to here we need to somehow"
2403840,2411840," bring everything so we can apply directly to a plus b and get everything um you know reflectively equal to"
2411840,2423120," each other so what we actually need in here is um a way to demonstrate that this thing is equal to uh this"
2423120,2431920," thing right which is kind of an opposite to the definition of the sum right so essentially we need to have"
2431920,2439280," another definition of the sum that is like that but it uses b as the counter right so we need to demonstrate"
2439280,2445760," that it doesn't matter which operand you use as a counter you end up with the same result so i think"
2445760,2452640," we could just basically go with an additional lemma uh let's define uh sort of like a sum lemma"
2452640,2457760," uh that is like that uh so and to keep things consistent i'm actually going to do it like this"
2458480,2463920," uh right so this is the additional lemma that we're going to have um right and we can prove that lemma"
2463920,2468800," also inductively right so it's an additional thing just to prove so the base is registered forward"
2468800,2477920," uh right so this is going to be the zero and then we're going to do some um id i suppose right so and this"
2477920,2484960," is reflectively equal to each other so that's totally fine uh right so and in here uh we're going to do an"
2484960,2493920," inductive step now uh so this is the inductive step um boom right there we go i forgot to actually make"
2493920,2501520," this thing equal and let's do the sum definition the usual sum definition um and in here as you can see"
2501520,2509040," we have this exact expression as in the original lemma so we are allowed to reuse the original lemma on that"
2509040,2517040," thing and we end up with the same thing uh right so we have now uh this addition lemma that we can use"
2517040,2526080," to define this inductive thing right so let me first delete whatever we got in here uh and"
2526080,2535440," try to do this thing one more time so we're going to do the usual sum thingy and also sum lemma right so"
2535440,2543440," this is sum lemma and as you can see we got the situation uh where we have literally have a plus b"
2543440,2551120," in the original sum com and a plus b in here uh right so we can just apply this thing to the zero one"
2551120,2557680," and this is reflectively equal to the original thing so this is how i should have proved it uh but for some"
2557680,2563600," reason on the stream i didn't realize that right so but even though it doesn't really hurt uh right you"
2563600,2570800," just um add an additional lemma and you move on i suppose so let's move on with the video so this is"
2570800,2578640," committativity very useful property of of addition um so another useful property of addition is probably"
2578640,2586640," associativity right as i already said associativity is very useful one so uh let's define it uh associativity a"
2586640,2593200," plus b plus c uh equal to a plus b plus c um"
2593200,2603360," so and we can yet again abuse the mathematical induction in fact mathematical induction just like"
2603360,2610000," makes everything super easy right so we're going to start with the base uh right and uh what variable"
2610000,2615280," we're going to induct by i think we're going to induct by a as well right so let's actually replace a with zero"
2615280,2623920," uh so this is uh the base it's all about the base do you see what kind of step we can apply in here so"
2623920,2625920," it's pretty obvious some idea"
2625920,2639120," the base has been proven that freaking easy okay so next one uh is going to be the induction step right so"
2639120,2644800," let's do the induction step so induction step we're inducting by uh the a so we're going to increment a"
2644800,2651280," like so and within the induction step we are allowed to use some asoc because it's a previous step"
2651280,2657680," uh all right so what do we have in here well that is pretty straightforward some actually fits perfectly"
2657680,2665520," in here so let's apply some in here uh well it's pretty cool i think we can we can try to apply it"
2665520,2672000," one more time right so we can apply these two here right and actually bring everything under the s"
2672000,2680240," okay so they're pretty much the same but they are like different in parenthesis but we are allowed to use"
2680240,2686000," some asoc within the inductive step right so let's actually try to apply it like this and"
2686000,2698480," we proved both of the properties of the sum commutativity and associativity all of them"
2698480,2702800," we just prove them inductively starting from the piano axioms"
2702800,2714960," right so this is so cool it's it's kind of cool that you can just like mechanically and it just like"
2714960,2720480," fits it it's like a it's like a puzzle pieces they just fall into places it's so cool"
2722320,2728880," uh it's so freaking cool so let's actually save this i think uh right so this is what we have"
2728880,2734800," this is on the sum uh so i don't think we need any other properties of sum it's just a commutativity and"
2734800,2742160," associativity so i suppose one of the things we have to do is to move on to multiplication we have to move"
2742160,2748800," on to multiplication multiplication is actually rather easy right uh so because for example if you have three"
2748800,2756160," three multiplied by x what you end up uh with you end up with x plus x plus x right so you have to repeat"
2756160,2763920," uh this amount of times the right operand so that's what you have to do um let's go ahead and do that so"
2763920,2770800," uh the easiest way to do that it would be to just pick the counter like with the sum right because we're"
2770800,2776800," defining that recursively we need to pick the counter so let's use the left operand as the counter similar"
2776800,2784960," to how we do that with the sum uh right so we're gonna do that and since this is the counter we are"
2784960,2792800," repeating the right operator so that means we're gonna do b plus a multiplied by b so we're defining"
2792800,2800720," multiplication through addition we're defining it through addition there we go so now what we can try"
2800720,2808800," to do we can try to see mechanically how it is going to work so let's try to uh multiply um x by three right"
2808800,2815280," so how it's gonna go so first of all we need to apply three um so it's not three it's three excuse me"
2815280,2822720," all right so let's apply this thing and we get that so as you can see here you can think about this expression"
2822720,2830880," as sort of like the emitter this expression emits axis as long as it have this thing right as long as"
2830880,2836240," it have this thing so we can keep applying it until you get to this point until you get to the base"
2836240,2842800," but what do you do with this space we never actually define that we need to define this the base of this"
2842800,2848880," recursion somehow axiomatically so let's actually define multiplication zero and we can literally say uh"
2848880,2853360," zero multiplied by anything is equal to zero right so it is equal to zero so we have that"
2853360,2861040," so then we can apply this entire thing and we ended up with zero in here and that is as we know"
2861040,2867440," is actually some id but it's with a zero at the different side so it's some id commutative so we're"
2867440,2872800," going to apply this thing in here uh there we go and this is what we got so we had three multiplied"
2872800,2878720," by x we expanded that using multiplication definitions and addition definitions that's very"
2878720,2886080," important and we got this thing so this is a pretty good definition of multiplication it works exactly"
2886080,2893040," like multiplication so make sense hopefully that makes sense uh so we can finish with this shaping so"
2893040,2897440," let me actually save this entire thing because i want to reorder some of these things uh right i would"
2897440,2902480," like to put zero maybe at the top so first this is the base of the recursion and this is the recursion"
2902480,2911360," itself um right so i think we are good to go i think we're good to go so around wrap and let's actually"
2911360,2917520," load piano and uh so what's going to be the next property that we need to prove in here uh maybe"
2917520,2924320," commutativity uh or maybe multiplication sum distribution right multiplication sum distribution is"
2924320,2930720," actually very important property that we will need for uh square of sum so we can try to uh to prove"
2930720,2938560," that multiplication identity is pretty straightforward i i feel like we can prove it um directly right so"
2938560,2944880," one multiply by a is equal to a uh yeah we can multiply we can prove it directly i'm pretty sure so we'll"
2944880,2951600," need uh the one definition right so we'll need the one definition um right one equal to that so we can apply"
2951600,2958960," this thing so this is what we got and then we just do multiplication uh right then we do zero then we do"
2958960,2966000," zero and then some id commutative and there we go we just proved multiplication id so there is nothing"
2966000,2971280," particularly interesting in here right so um but we can have it why not we can have it"
2973040,2980560," uh so let me see i would like to maybe put these things uh i suppose something like numbers should"
2980560,2986240," be probably uh something built in into the language but i don't want this language to be"
2986240,2994400," uh you know i want i want this language to be more like agnostic right so uh even numbers in that language"
2994400,3000080," are just symbols and you can redefine those symbols however you want you can just like redefine them"
3000080,3007200," however you want so for example here we're missing four uh we can actually define four uh but so this"
3007200,3013440," is going to be something like this so one two three four five are good enough right so we're going to"
3013440,3019120," hardcore them so multiplication id uh we can keep it in here i don't think it's particularly useful"
3019840,3025520," uh but we can keep it in here um okay i'll wrap uh and just all this into i think"
3025520,3033680," so let's try a multiplication commutativity i think it's going to be useful uh so it's b a"
3033680,3041840," we can try to prove that yet again um using uh the induction right we can try to prove it using the"
3041840,3049120," induction all right so we're going to start with the base and i can already see uh the problem uh because"
3050240,3055360," if we put uh if we start with zero we're going to have zero on the right side but we don't have a"
3055360,3060640," zero on the right side defined so it's kind of a similar situation as with the sum id commutative"
3060640,3067760," so we probably need to have like multiplication zero um commutative right so something like this"
3067760,3073600," so we can try to do that i think is there like is it pretty necessary to have this kind of thing"
3074320,3080560," i don't know we'll see we'll see right so we're gonna have that and let's just go ahead and prove"
3080560,3088320," that that should be praised pretty easy to do so this is zero uh boom um multiplication zero applying"
3088320,3095440," and reflexivity boom it is true it has been proven easy peasy a lemon a squeezy mother flip us"
3095440,3104800," so induction step uh this one is going to be s uh right so this is that boom so let's apply multiplication"
3104800,3111520," let's apply multiplication okay that's pretty cool uh we can assume this thing to be true inside of the"
3111520,3120800," induction step so that means we can quite easily just apply that zero plus zero uh sum id all reflexivity"
3120800,3130400," boom easy it's kind of cool that to prove the properties of the multiplication you need the"
3130400,3136000," properties of addition because multiplication is basically an addition right so it's it's more"
3136000,3141680," powerful addition it is more powerful addition essentially right because uh if you take a look"
3141680,3147840," at the uh the multiplication zero in here right so far we've been using multiplication properties and"
3147840,3154800," then at the end addition all of a sudden right some so you still need them so they basically build on top of"
3154800,3167600," each other um so we build on top of each other okay so since we defined this specific thing we can"
3167600,3172000," now try to go ahead and do the same stuff for multiplication commutativity we're going to start"
3172000,3179360," with the base uh so this is going to be zero and now since we have the you know right hand side defined"
3179360,3185760," in here uh we can just quickly do that so we can do multiplication zero for the first one and then"
3185760,3194480," for the other one easy reflexivity the base has been proven easy so uh what about the induction step"
3194480,3200320," what about the induction step so this is going to be induction so we're inducting by a uh right so we"
3200320,3208080," incrementing it like that uh so let's do multiplication for all of them uh okay so that's pretty cool"
3209360,3218960," um so we probably we can move around these things so we need to actually swap around this stuff so this"
3218960,3225360," is going to be one okay so which allows us to do multiplication one more time and that's basically"
3225360,3234080," reflexivity has been proven and we've got absolutely the same situation as with the sum commutativity right"
3234080,3238960," but with multiplication this time uh we can't really do things like that what we need to"
3238960,3246480," uh do we need to have a similar definition as this one but the one that demonstrates that you can use"
3246480,3253280," b as a counter right you can use b as a counter uh but in fact in in this specific case since we're"
3253280,3259840," using b as a counter we are actually sort of um emitting a's instead of instead of b's and in here"
3259840,3267440," we probably want to actually swap them around uh right to continue use uh b as the counter but not really"
3267440,3271760," actually yeah actually yeah so i think we're going to do it like that so this is the lemma that we want"
3271760,3278240," to have in here right so let's try to now prove this lemma inductively so this is going to be the base"
3278240,3284240," uh we're going to use a uh as the inductive step i'm not sure if it's a good idea but let's give it a"
3284240,3294960," try i think it's going to be fine so uh multiplication zero so we're going to apply that then uh sum id boom and uh"
3294960,3302480," easy peasy lemon squeezy so uh now let's do the inductive step uh so this is going to be inductive"
3302480,3311440," uh there we go so we have to add all of these things in here all right and yeah we can't do that"
3311440,3317920," without equals equals so let's do the multiplication definition all right so this is the multiplication"
3317920,3326320," definition definition um all right what else do we have in here so dilemma do we have dilemma though"
3326320,3334080," uh i don't think so uh so at least i can see that we can apply this sum definition in some particular"
3334080,3346720," situations um and so the original lemma is yeah we can see the original lemma in here so a multiply by sb"
3346720,3355840," and a multiply by sb so that means i can uh actually apply this lemma at the first one there we go and"
3356400,3364080," basically i've got the original thing except i need to sort of re-massage the um you know the"
3364080,3370240," parenthesis and stuff like that so but that's already about the sum distribution associativity right"
3370240,3376560," so let's actually apply it to here uh maybe i have to do that in a reversed order so this is the reversed"
3376560,3383920," order then some commutativity uh right so this is going to be no actually not this one it has to be the first"
3383920,3396000," one there we go um and then some associativity i suppose uh the zeros one though yeah it has to be"
3396000,3401360," probably not a reversed one there we go and as you can see these two things are reflexively equal to"
3401360,3408000," each other and there we go we just proved that multiplication lemma right and we can try to now"
3408560,3417760," prove that induction step so i'm going to remove that so and let's go ahead and just simply prove that"
3417760,3423600," so i'm going to do multiplication right so we'll get multiplication and also let's do multiplication"
3423600,3432960," lemma uh right so we got this kind of thing and uh right so and we have already directly the expression"
3432960,3438880," that we can apply for multiplication commutativity so this is going to be this one and there we go we"
3438880,3445200," just proved this thing more or less correctly right so it requires uh additional lemma so it's kind of"
3445200,3452400," like a symmetrical situation as with the sum uh which makes me think maybe maybe all of that is redundant"
3452400,3457920," so maybe i'm defining too many lemmas and too many theorems i don't really know i'm not really a"
3457920,3463600," mathematician so maybe all of that is super redundant so please let me know and let me know"
3463600,3468960," in the comments if you can actually you know demonstrate all of that uh a little bit more"
3468960,3476000," simpler right so but that's basically my take on the on the whole thing so let's move on with it with the"
3476000,3483600," vote so i would like to also have multiplication um sum distribution so that's another interesting thing"
3483600,3491440," that i would like to have in here uh right so uh this is going to be essentially a multiplied by b plus c"
3491440,3499760," is equal to a b plus uh ac that's a very important property that is a very important property we yet"
3499760,3509600," again can prove it uh inductively inducting by uh by a so this is going to be the base zero zero zero you"
3509600,3514000," can already see that it's very easy to prove like everything multiplied by zero we already have"
3514000,3520720," a multiplication by zero this base is done this base is straight up done you can literally see that"
3520720,3527280," it's super easy to prove so multiplication zero in in one we're gonna prove that in one shot we're gonna"
3527280,3535520," just prove that in one shot bam i forgot about the plus i was hoping that it's gonna be like a one shot"
3535520,3540400," proof like just apply the multiplication zero definition it's gonna be we still need to do plus"
3540400,3550880," god damn it right so it's a sum id uh right so and of course reflexivity and sure right but it looked so"
3550880,3557680," easy right it looked so easy uh so the induction step what about the induction step so this is going to be"
3557680,3565600," like that uh so and we have to induct uh all of the a's in here conduct all of the a's and this one is"
3565600,3574640," going to be equal uh to that you baited by yourself lol yeah exactly good so what we can do in here well"
3574640,3580000," we can probably start with just applying the definition of multiplication right so this definition like"
3580000,3585200," seems to be pretty straightforward so let's apply to all of them uh and see what's going to happen"
3585200,3594000," okay so i can already see that we can apply the assumed distribution in here right so this is"
3594000,3598400," basically the direct definition from here and see what's going to happen so"
3598400,3605760," okay so they are basically equivalent you can already literally see that those things are"
3605760,3613440," basically equivalent to each other we just need to massage the addition distribution addition"
3613440,3619120," associativity to bring them to the same thing you can already see that it's just a matter of massaging"
3619120,3625200," the the parentheses and stuff like that so let's go ahead and do that so uh let me see so we have"
3625200,3633840," some associativity all right so uh some a sock so i suppose we can just bring these parentheses over"
3633840,3640240," these three things right so this is going to be just the first thing and um so i'm going to be massaging"
3640240,3644560," this part to bring this part to bring it to look like this part i think this is the most reasonable"
3644560,3651040," thing to happen here uh so in here we probably want to do the reversed associativity"
3651040,3662240," uh okay so this has to be undo uh on the yeah there we go um so after that after that we probably want to"
3662240,3668160," swap around these two things right so this is going to be some commutativity and by the way we're using"
3668160,3675040," property the that we already proved we already proved of this property so we are allowed to just use them"
3675040,3682320," we're allowed to just use them so uh one zero one two i suppose we need to do a commutativity on the two"
3682320,3689120," and there we go so that seems to be working so now we need to remassage so as you can see they are in the same"
3689120,3696800," order as on the right hand side so they are already on the on the right order so some associativity so we"
3696800,3705920," need to apply it like that all right and then we need to reapply it like that and these two things are"
3705920,3717120," equivalent we can check that it is true easy peasy lemon squeezy how about that we just proved uh the"
3717120,3724000," multiplication sum distribution inductively right both of these statements are true that was a little"
3724000,3730560," bit difficult actually so you had to be super careful with this one right so you had to like be very precise"
3730560,3736880," notice how quite often we just use all right so we just use all but here you have to be super precise"
3736880,3741840," you have to precisely say which sub expressions you have to replace and that's a little bit difficult"
3741840,3749840," right and i was thinking about better ways of indexing the sub expressions right so i think this is something"
3749840,3754960," that i wanted to fix in the new version of ripple right so i have a new ripple which is interactive and"
3754960,3760960," stuff like that but one of the things we can do in this ripple in this old ripple is to have um maybe"
3760960,3770160," some sort of a command uh so something like matches where i could say a certain rule some a sock uh right"
3770160,3776480," some a sock and it will basically enumerate all of the matches right it would highlight all of the"
3776480,3783680," sub expressions that match this specific thing and tell me its number and tell me its number so that"
3783680,3790240," i can use that number then later to put it in here right something like that would be already super useful"
3790240,3796160," because like counting this thing yourself is a little bit tedious luckily you can just experiment you can"
3796160,3803200," just do zero and then if it didn't work you can always undo and try a different one right so"
3803200,3808880," you can kind of do that but it's a little bit of a little bit of a friction a little bit of a friction"
3808880,3815760," uh right so but it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't so we have commutativity do we need"
3815760,3821440," multiplication associativity we might need multiplication associativity but i don't quite remember"
3822080,3825760," so let me say whatever we have in here um right"
3825760,3838720," so multiplication asoc uh a multiplied by b multiplied by c equal to a multiplied by b multiplied by c so"
3838720,3847440," that's the statement uh what we can do with that statement let's do the base it's only about the base"
3850160,3855920," can we prove that in one shot i don't think so right because this will require at least two shots"
3855920,3863040," so let's do multiplication zero uh a boom yeah it requires two shots but then at the end you have"
3863040,3871840," reflexivity boom it has been proven successfully so induction step uh so this is going to be s and this is"
3871840,3881360," going to be s uh so what we can do in here probably just multiplication just apply multiplication and see"
3881360,3891040," what's going to happen right so what kind of stuff can happen here okay so oh oh you need multiplication"
3891040,3898880," distribution uh huh but you can apply it because it's on the uh on a different side on the left side but"
3898880,3901600," we have multiplication commutativity"
3901600,3912080," multiplication commutativity so uh which one should we apply i don't remember i don't know how to do that"
3912640,3923120," one two three i suppose four this is the the fourth one uh uh i suppose it's a third one yeah there we go"
3923120,3930960," yeah you probably count them like this from left to right okay so what's the multiplication some"
3930960,3939360," distribution uh is going to be i think i can just do zero there we go and that's basically it that is"
3939360,3945360," basically so we just need to massage these things to to look like this thing and we're gucci we're"
3945360,3950560," basically tamaguchi you're ready to massage the expressions a little bit so that's what we do on the"
3950560,3956560," judging channel we're massaging the expressions so multiplication commutativity so let's just apply it to"
3956560,3964480," the zeros one so we're kind of done with this these two things so everything's fine so and we need to bring"
3964480,3973760," c to here in fact we have to yeah it's kind of interesting so let's do multiplication commutativity"
3973760,3980320," uh multiplication commutativity zero one two all right so this is going to be two okay cb"
3980320,3992800," multiplication associativity so it has to be reversed but it has to be ah wait that's really weird okay so that"
3992800,3999680," worked uh that actually worked uh that actually worked and i suppose we need to do multiplication commutativity"
3999680,4011520," on the first one uh on the zeros one uh second one there we go all right multiplication associativity"
4012880,4022080," uh inverse one okay i think we're done so that's basically reflexivity boom dab dab dab first try to"
4022080,4028480," look at that another quick remark i could have actually done all of that a little bit more clean"
4028480,4034400," uh right so what i could have done i could have just swapped these two things right so i could do"
4034400,4040960," multiplication commutative commutative commutative and i think it's uh zero one two three four it's the"
4040960,4049120," fourth one uh right there we go and then i could have just apply the multiplication associativity to"
4049120,4058960," this one uh right just zero and uh get these both of the sides equal except well uh this one as well"
4058960,4064960," right i can do multiplication commutativity on the the very first one and there you go i basically got"
4064960,4070960," two these two things equal to each other right so that would have been a little bit more clean i went to"
4070960,4076800," a very different route and uh i don't know it was not particularly satisfying when i was looking back"
4076800,4084400," uh to the board anyway so let's go back so i think we proved everything with multiplication right so"
4084400,4089280," is there anything else but maybe if there is something else we we don't really need it anyway"
4089280,4097840," so another thing that we need in here is the definition of power right because we're going to be"
4097840,4103360," arising uh this sum into the power of two we're going to be rising the sum into the power of two"
4104080,4111600," let's just go ahead and define the power so a to the power of yeah so in case of a power it is super"
4111600,4117520," easy to decide who's going to be the counter power is basically the same as multiplication but it uses"
4117520,4125120," multiplication instead of addition you see what i mean so essentially uh right you have the power itself"
4125120,4134240," as the counter right and you just keep replicating uh things like that you just keep emitting ace"
4134240,4140640," you just keep emitting ace and decrementing the the power so that's basically what you keep doing so"
4140640,4147120," that's the power definition uh we can take for instance uh x and write it to to the power of three"
4147120,4152800," and see how mechanically it will work uh right of course we want to apply it like that and let's keep"
4152800,4157840," applying the power definition uh and as you can see it's similar to the multiplication right but"
4157840,4162800," it's using multiplication instead of addition it's just like one a level higher all right and you keep"
4162800,4171600," doing that until you end up with this thing that we didn't define and this is basically power zero right"
4171600,4177440," let's define as a power zero i don't know but it's basically the base of the power definition and we know"
4177440,4183440," that it's equal to one right we know that it's equal to one uh and we uh can just replace it so this is"
4183440,4190320," power zero uh let's apply it apply it super quick uh there we go and we need to get rid of this one uh"
4190320,4196240," right first of all we probably want to you know apply this one and uh let's just follow the definition"
4196240,4201040," of multiplication all of a sudden we need to follow the definition of multiplication so this is going to be"
4201040,4213040," um actually move yeah so we'll probably need to commute the second one yeah because the multiplication"
4213040,4219440," definition uses the left side for the counter right so it's a little bit inconvenient uh and there we go so"
4219440,4226080," we've got that so then multiplication zero we're going to end up with that and then some uh some id"
4226080,4236000," some id commutative and we get that so finally right so we take a look at how many steps we have to take"
4236000,4241520," this is how many steps we have to take to actually mechanically perform you know rising x to the power of"
4241520,4252960," three um right uh all right all right all right all right so yes yes okay so i'm gonna close that"
4252960,4258240," so this is basically just demonstrate how this entire thing works so we have power and power zero"
4258240,4265520," so let me save this entire thing so piano uh i'm gonna put this stuff in here i'm gonna put this stuff"
4265520,4269600," in here do we need anything i don't think we need anything else actually so we don't really use"
4269600,4280000," any special properties of the power anywhere here uh right so yeah i think that's fine um so let me go"
4280000,4289440," here i'm gonna load up the piano knock um and let's just go ahead and prove square um square of sum"
4290720,4300160," and it's basically a plus b to the square can we now having this arsenal of different properties and"
4300160,4305200," the definitions that we basically proved i think i think i managed to convince you that this all of"
4305200,4313120," these properties are true can we prove now this thing let's give it a try so uh first of all maybe i'm gonna"
4313120,4321440," like define like define square right and square is this thing right so might as well actually follow the"
4321440,4332400," definition um yet again right so this is going to be two uh right and just to power right and this is power"
4334160,4343760," zero and there is no matching excuse me uh don't i have pop"
4350480,4353760," so here it is poll zero"
4353760,4358960," why there is no matching here why there is no match"
4358960,4372320," i'm an idiot okay because okay okay i see uh so essentially um the variables that actually"
4372320,4377920," participate in pattern matching and capturing and stuff like that they always start with a capital letter"
4378640,4384880," i accidentally used a small letter in here and small letter is just a symbol it's not a variable"
4384880,4389200," it's not a variable uh it's a it's a symbol right so"
4389200,4397600," uh all right so we have to do i probably have to delete uh power zero right so i can delete power"
4397600,4403680," zero and i can actually redefine it uh quite easily so i can just say something like this there we go"
4404720,4411280," so uh now i should be able to apply this thing one more time there we go and i think uh"
4411280,4417440," yeah didn't we define multiplication id yeah we actually define multiplication id so i don't have to"
4417440,4422400," go through all of that but multiplication id is on the other side so we need to do multiplication"
4422400,4429200," commutativity right so on the first one and then multiplication id on the zeros one and there we go so"
4429200,4436160," this is what we managed to prove and uh right so we have a square in here we have a square in here and"
4436160,4442720," now we can apply that square to the um to the current thing that we're trying to shape so it's kind of"
4442720,4448160," cool that you can do nested shapings right so while you're shaping one expression you can realize oh i need"
4448160,4454240," to prove another thing so you can start another shaping and once you're done with that you can go back to"
4454240,4459200," to the previous shaping that you had so they're literally nested we organize this stack of shaping"
4459200,4466160," so yeah so i basically define square while i was defining the uh square of sum so which is rather"
4466160,4471920," convenient so all right so here we can have multiplication sum distribution right so this is"
4471920,4476560," what we want to apply in here so that's pretty cool so now we need to swap these things around"
4477120,4485840," uh like so and apply the sum uh sum distribution one more time um yeah that's pretty cool and we can"
4485840,4495520," apply squares again but in reverse and yeah we kind of you can feel that we actually went full circle"
4495520,4500960," right this is something that we were doing at the beginning this of the of the stream but now all of"
4500960,4506080," these properties we literally proved them at the beginning of the stream we were using them"
4506080,4514000," axiomatically we just claimed that they are true right but now we know that they are true we proved"
4514000,4519840," we demonstrated that isn't that progress i think that's pretty freaking progress so now we need to"
4519840,4524800," massage all of these things around right so let's actually swap this thing uh right so this is in"
4524800,4532560," duplication commutativity and we'll apply it to the first one there we go so uh let's do uh addition"
4532560,4540560," some associativity all right so this is going to be on the first one uh then we need to inverse it"
4540560,4548160," on the first one and we keep making the same there we go so now we need to bring these"
4548160,4554160," two things together so maybe we can define double all right and double is basically a"
4555440,4559920," right so let's actually shape it super quick let's actually shape let's apply it to two then"
4559920,4565760," multiplication uh right so this is multiplication multiplication then location zero"
4565760,4574720," yep and addition uh some id"
4577760,4585120," uh yeah some commutative one i could have just some id commutative i don't know why i did it like"
4585120,4590480," that but i think i'm just started all right so we have double we basically proved it what we have in"
4590480,4598000," here i can just do double but in reverse uh right i can just do double but in reverse and we just"
4598640,4608560," proved square of sum right here it is that was a direct proof but this is something that uh we did at"
4608560,4614720," the beginning of the stream but now this is a complete proof starting from piano axioms"
4614720,4625120," right and it took uh 150 lines almost 150 lines right so these are all the steps uh right and we can"
4625280,4632480," actually run it again run the entire proof again and it actually goes through all of these definitions"
4632480,4638480," and basically demonstrates that all of that is true right it traces all the transformation that we've done"
4640000,4651360," uh right so yeah this is kind of cool when i was developing knock i was i wasn't thinking about how"
4651360,4657840," i'm gonna do mathematical induction in this language i just accidentally discovered oh yeah you can just"
4657840,4663280," do it like that why not and it kind of demonstrates inductively that this thing is true and you can kind"
4663280,4671040," of treat it as a proof right so yeah and if you keep applying mathematical induction uh you can prove like"
4671040,4680080," a lot of things starting from piano axioms so that's pretty cool and i want to make this a part of the"
4680080,4687040," standard library right i want to make this as part of the standard library because uh reflexivity is probably"
4687040,4694480," very important thing to have right so basically any proof should end up with reflexivity uh right so if"
4694480,4700880," you're making like some sort of a statement uh of one thing equal to another thing um so i'm still"
4700880,4706880," thinking whether i want to do this kind of stuff automatically in the language right so hard code this"
4706880,4712480," kind of stuff in the language but i'm not quite sure right because i want this language to be sort of"
4712480,4718560," abstracted away from the actual math right so all of these things are just symbols they're just symbols"
4718560,4724000," and you are the one who gives them the meaning right you are the one who gives them the meaning"
4724000,4735520," so that's a bit faster than a principal mathematical proof of two plus two equal four can we by the way"
4735520,4743680," prove that two plus two is equal four can we prove that let's actually see right like having all of"
4743680,4757360," these things in here so uh all right so rl wrap load piano so um two plus two two plus two can we prove that"
4757920,4781680," that's the whole proof that's the whole proof that's the whole proof of two plus two equals four"
4784960,4791280," that was easy that was easy oh once you have all of these tools right you can just use them and"
4791280,4800640," and prove uh that's so cool right and in in my opinion something like knock is way easier to grasp"
4800640,4807840," than cock um one problem that i constantly have with cock uh one problem that i constantly have with cock"
4807840,4814640," i'm going to actually show you um is the amount of control in terms of how you apply"
4814960,4821840," different theorems for instance quite often right you see i need to have a lot of control like where"
4821840,4827360," exactly to which sub-expression exactly i apply a certain thing and i couldn't figure out how the"
4827360,4834720," fuck do to do that in cock right like maybe there is a way where you can have like a lot of control how"
4834720,4841200," you apply these things but in cock you either apply it everywhere or nowhere it's just like everywhere or"
4841200,4846960," nowhere or shut the fuck up right so and one of the motivations of having no is just to be able to have"
4846960,4853520," like this very fine control over how you apply these things i couldn't figure out so people in the chat"
4853520,4860400," say that you also couldn't figure out how to do that okay so i'm not the only one um so i didn't know"
4860400,4866880," am i missing something i just maybe i just don't know something about coke or is it really like that you"
4866880,4872480," can't have like a very fine control over how you massage the parentheses and stuff like that"
4872480,4879520," so i i don't know because i want to have like this kind of control right so where i can say precisely"
4879520,4888240," okay this specific sag expression that one and the number three just swap it around it's just like this"
4888240,4895360," this this is what you want um i think you can but it's not intuitive yeah it's definitely not intuitive"
4895360,4901200," to be fair it is not intuitive in knock either it is not intuitive in knock either but this is because i"
4901200,4906160," haven't come up with a better way as already said one of the things i want to have one of the things i"
4906160,4912240," want to have is to be able to say show me all the sub expressions that match this pattern and enumerate them"
4912240,4919040," right and then i could just pick the number and plug it into the uh shaping rule and it will just work"
4919040,4924480," right so i didn't have to experiment like apply that and do apply that and do so we don't have to do that"
4924480,4929360," so once we have that ability which i might stream by the way so why not maybe it's i'm"
4929360,4935120," going to do a stream where i implement that ability that enumerator uh once we have that"
4935120,4947200," it's it's can be perfect right uh yeah yeah but nook is not production great software yeah exactly"
4947200,4955040," coke is a very serious business software this is just like a toy uh so i think we already have the piano"
4955040,4963760," knock uh right so if i take a look at the standard library uh std std knock yeah there we go we already"
4963760,4969200," i think it's kind of funny how i defined these definitions uh so we have all of these properties"
4969200,4973920," but none of them are already proven so we also have like the subtraction and stuff like that"
4973920,4980560," and of course a square of sum it's kind of proven but now we have a full proof of all of that um right"
4980560,4986960," now we have a full proof of all of that all right so i guess that's it for today uh so thanks everyone"
4986960,4992800," who's watching me right now i really appreciate that uh have a good one and i see you all on the next"
4992800,4998000," recreation programming session i'm really apologize for the for the weird time of streaming right so"
4998000,5005520," my sleeping schedule is completely fucked up and at the usual time i'm sleeping right now so i don't"
5005520,5011920," know for how long uh i'm gonna do streams at this time but we'll see so all right that's it for today"
5011920,5018320," thanks everyone for watching and yeah love you"
