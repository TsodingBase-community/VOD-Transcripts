0,6580," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session with Ahu Mr. Azuzin."
6580,11220," So today I want you to take a look at a very interesting thing that is called PyPy."
11220,15580," It's a Python interpreter that is somehow implemented in itself."
15580,21980," So if you know anything about software development and specifically programming languages"
21980,28220," and how programming languages work, it sounds really weird at first because Python is an"
28220,35700," interpreted language. Right, so an interpreted language is basically an interpreter, a separate"
35700,43560," program that reads the source code of your program and instead of turning that source code into another"
43560,51380," program, it just acts like the program that is described. You know what I'm talking about? Right,"
51380,58060," instead of creating a new program, it just looks at the description of what it needs to do and acts"
58060,64740," like that program. That's what's called being interpreted. Right, and if you're writing Python"
64740,71040," in itself, how the fuck do you even do that? Right, so you have an interpreter, then you have the source"
71040,76000," code of your Python interpreter, you're interpreting the source code of the Python interpreter to"
76000,82960," interpret the Python code. What the fuck is that? Are you fucking crazy? And on top of that, PyPy"
82960,112780," is pride itself being faster than Python. What the fuck is going on in here? Like, what the fuck is this shit? Like, when you read about this stuff, it's just like, it's crazy. It's nuts. How the fuck do you even do that? It looks like a meme. And no wonder nobody takes it seriously, by the way, but that's besides the point. So the cool thing they did, the cool thing they did."
112780,119460," They introduced, the cool thing they did. They introduced actually RPython. RPython is"
119460,127540," a subset of Python that is small and compact enough that it is translatable to see."
127540,136520," But since it's a subset, the code written in RPython is still interpreted by the full Python compiler."
136520,163280," You see what they did? You see what they did? They have a limited version of Python, right? And the entire interpreter implemented in that limited Python. You can interpret it with real Python interpreter. And then they have a separate analyzer and translator that analyzes that code in limited Python and turns it into C and compiles it. So that's what they did."
163520,170200," So it's funny, like you may argue, okay, it's not Python implemented in Python. It's actually Python implemented"
170200,179240," in RPython. But RPython is a subset. And since it is interpreted by Python, it is technically Python."
179240,186480," So it is Python implemented in Python. Isn't that fascinating? That's fucking fascinating."
186480,200120," So, and this is what made me to actually, you know, check this entire thing, right? I'm really curious. I used PyPy before. I actually used PyPy before, but I never looked inside of it."
200920,210600," Right. And what I want you to do today, I want you to fucking look inside of it. Like, how the fuck did you do that? Can we write like a, uh, actual programs in RPython?"
210600,221380," Can RPython replace C? That's a very good question, right? So if RPython is this limited subset of Python, can we just use it instead of C?"
221380,236260," Why do we need even Mojo if we already have RPython, right? Mojo is basically like a native language that tries to look like Python, but isn't RPython already that? And it was invented like many years ago?"
236260,238380," Can we just use RPython? Why do we need Mojo?"
239060,247940," Okay, I know why we need that. We need to, like, you know, burn investors' money, but that's besides the point. If we put that out of the equation, like, why exactly do we need..."
247940,263260," Anyway, let's actually download this shit. So, what do we have? What do we have? So, we have a bunch of binaries. And I suppose we also have a bunch of code. Let's fucking go."
265260,275580," Right, so this is gonna be a probe. And, uh, so PyPy, PyPy, and then we get, and, uh, let's actually, yeah, download this entire shit."
275580,286940," I hope it's not gonna take half of an hour. Fuck. It's taking some time. I'm actually streaming over a VPN, so fuck me."
288200,296320," Well, I mean, it's not that long, right? So, it's a couple of minutes. So, we can talk. We can talk while we're waiting for PyPy to download."
296320,298660," So, how is it going, everyone?"
298660,305080," So, kill the stream. I'm not gonna be killing the stream. What the fuck are you talking about? No."
306380,309300," Virtual Python network, VPN. Haha!"
309300,320040," This is how yapping starts. Well, I mean, we're, we're genuinely waiting. We're genuinely waiting for the source code download, okay?"
322280,335480," Can you use common Python libraries with PyPy, like NumPy, and such? I heard that yes, but not all of them. Right, so they, they, I think they, somewhere on the website, they have some sort of, like, a compatibility sheet or something like that."
335480,339800," So, there are features. Compatibility. Okay. So, here is the compatibility."
339800,354780," Pure Python code works. Just a pure Python code works. But there are a few differences with the object lifetime management modules that use CPython, C API will probably work, but will not achieve the speedup via the JIT."
355180,372860," We encourage library authors to use C FFI and HPy instead. So, this is something about, you know, calling to C libraries. If you're looking for how to use PyPy with a scientific Python ecosystem, we encourage you to use Conda. I have no idea what the fuck it is. I'm not a Python developer."
373540,392020," Right, so, all of a sudden, just became, okay, something like that. So, I suppose things that are written in pure Python will work, which are probably majority of the, of the web frameworks, right? So, probably, maybe Django works or whatnot."
392460,405140," So, that's the only thing I know about this kind of shit. It's the only thing I know. Okay, so, we've got some subs. Thank you so much, R.Torriswear, for the message, hello again. Great stream. Have you seen Moj?"
405140,411460," I haven't. I heard about it, but I haven't seen it. The expressiveness of Python and the performance of C."
412900,427740," So, Python compatible syntax with the option to go low level. Are they still, you know, subscription only? So, can I just go to their website, download the binary and just start using it like I do with PyPy?"
427740,438100," I just downloaded the source code of PyPy. Can I do the same with Mojo without, you know, giving my email, making accounts or any shit like that?"
438740,441460," Can I do something like that? Mojo store?"
441460,446080," Okay, I know. I know. I know. I know."
446080,450040," So, Mojo programming for all of AI."
450040,459320," If I can't do that, fuck that. I'm not giving any information. I just want to download some shit. Like, can I do that?"
459320,465700," Can I just fucking download this shit? I don't fucking see it. So, there's a get started."
468580,477000," And see, sorry. So, thank you. Thank you for the Twitch Prime. And already downloaded. Look at that. Look at that."
477000,487400," We already downloaded the source code. The source code. Okay, let's actually try to unpack it. So, we're unpacking it. It's taking some time because there's all the files."
487400,494540," Should have not done that through Emacs. And here is the source code in its glory. Right."
495200,513600," So, I already kind of like roughly looked into this folder. And from what I understood, there's two important folders in here, which is RPython, which contains the implementation of RPython Translator, and PyPy, which contains the implementation of Python."
514480,522900," Right. In RPython. Right. So, this is the implementation of this thing. Right. Does it have any sort of entry point or anything like that? It has init."
522900,531980," It has init. All right. But I'm not sure if it's actually has an entry point. The thing about RPython. Look at that. Look at that. It contains an entry point."
532480,539300," So, that means this folder in specific. This folder in specific is actually an executable. Right."
539300,547440," So, RPython Translator usage. Right. So, you have translation options. You have targets. Right. So, and you have target options."
547440,552160," Right. And it just calls to this implementation and stuff like that."
552620,570460," So, let's try to run it. Because it's kind of an interesting thing. Right. So, you probably won't expect that. But if you try to just run Python RPython. Right. It works as an executable. Right. So, it works exactly as you would expect. Right. It's just an executable."
571420,585220," So, let me try to run it. So, let me try to do that again. Python RPython. So, and it says that you can pass help in here. But then it kind of fails. Right. So, there's no module named RPython. Right."
585220,598980," So, if I remember correctly. So, there's something like a search path. Right. So, there is an environment variable called Python path. Right. So, and as far as I know."
599400,607200," So, you can just add the current thing to the Python path. And then just do RPython and help."
607200,615620," And you'll notice something interesting. Don't you notice something interesting?"
615620,624940," Don't you notice something interesting? Python 2.7. Yeah. Python 2.7."
624940,627980," Think about it."
629400,631760," It's a Python 3.7. It's a Python 3.7."
631760,635320," Implemented in Python 2.7."
635320,641280," That is bizarre."
641280,648760," So, it's a code that will probably work with Python 3.7."
648760,652280," But itself is implemented in Python 2.7."
652280,656080," That is fascinating, isn't it?"
657000,659360," Right. So, it's Python 3.7."
659360,659640," Right. So, it's Python 3.7."
659640,662220," But it's implemented in Python 3. And because of that, it's fine."
662220,665260," Right. So, the problem is that I don't have Python 2 in here."
665260,667900," Right. So, it's just like I don't have Python 2."
667900,668980," I only have Python 3."
668980,671420," So, I won't be able to run our Python."
671960,673560," So, but here's an interesting thing."
673560,679580," There is Python 2.7 executables in here."
679580,681640," Right. So, of PyPy."
681640,683260," Of PyPy."
683260,685040," Which I can probably download."
685040,687360," Right. Let's actually quickly try to do that."
687360,689000," So, here is an executable."
689000,690520," Actual binary executable."
691060,693620," And let's see if we can quickly do that."
693620,695920," So, I'm going to just do download this."
695920,699020," My new friend is going to take some time probably."
699020,700960," It's actually going faster."
700960,702380," I really appreciate that."
702380,704080," I really fucking appreciate that."
704080,706540," So, and let's just unpack this entire thing."
706540,709700," Right. So, this entire thing is being unpacked."
709700,712240," Right. So, there's no process in here."
712360,713120," Okay. So, that's cool."
713120,715100," And this is just a distribution."
715100,717920," Right. And it contains a bunch of things."
717920,720060," So, it contains PyPy."
720060,725840," And various basically symlinks that, you know, go into PyPy."
725840,729360," Right. So, this is pretty self-contained."
729360,732660," And it doesn't refer to anything that I personally don't have."
732660,736660," Right. So, that's totally fine."
736660,739580," Okay. So, let's put it like this."
740020,744020," So, that means I should be able to do something like that."
744020,745520," I didn't really."
745520,750900," Okay. So, PyPy2 and PyPy."
750900,752820," Right. So, if I try to."
752820,757600," Yeah. This was not the best idea to actually do that."
757600,760660," Right. So, because I actually want to start it from here."
760660,764660," PyPy2 bin PyPy."
764660,766520," Right. So, we'll get that."
766520,768580," And I just run RPython."
769020,770080," It seems to be running."
770080,773120," And if I do help, it actually works."
773120,777560," And what's funny is that it works without Python path in here."
777560,779980," Right. So, I didn't have to provide Python path in here."
779980,786860," I suppose the problems with Python path were due to, you know, having a different version of Python."
786860,787280," Right."
787680,792600," But, again, it's a compiler for, like, Python 3 anyway."
792600,794240," It's just implemented in Python 2."
794240,795880," Right. So, it's not the define."
795880,798120," And we can still run it to some extent."
798120,801140," So, the question is, how do you even fucking do that?"
801140,803100," How do you even translate something?"
803200,810620," Can I write some Python code and translate that code to C, for instance?"
810620,815760," Right. So, as you can see here, I can provide a target, specific target options."
816220,817880," Okay. So, usage translate."
817880,821900," Right. I have no idea what that's supposed to mean."
821900,826400," So, does it mean that I use this as a command?"
826400,828240," Could not find target translate."
828240,832220," Okay. So, what if I create main.py?"
832220,836320," Right. And I just put something like hello world in here."
836320,838000," Can I do something like that?"
838780,841940," All right. And then, I just do main.py."
841940,844320," That's okay."
844320,847760," That's a lot to unpack."
847760,849640," That's a lot to unpack."
849640,850760," Let's actually see."
850760,853520," So, this is where we started."
853520,857260," Okay. So, translation info."
857260,859420," Py.py. 7.3.17."
859420,862180," GCC. Set platform with host."
862180,864220," CC. None."
864220,865940," Using CC. GCC."
865940,867200," Version unknown."
867760,869100," Okay. That's very interesting."
869100,870320," And then, it said hello world."
870320,871220," Look at that."
871220,874040," It actually interpreted it to some extent."
874040,876740," Right. It actually, it said hello world."
876740,881400," And then, it traced back, saying that"
881400,886700," mine.py is not a valid target xxx.py."
886700,891560," Nice error message, by the way."
891560,895480," But I suppose this thing is not supposed to be like a user's facing."
895480,896740," Right. So, maybe that's why"
896740,898600," it's not particularly great error message."
898600,901140," Because it's for the developers of Py.py anyway."
901140,902660," So, who fucking cares?"
903480,907540," But, we have a little bit of a, like, actual source code in here."
907540,907920," Right."
907920,908860," xxx videos."
908860,909160," Yeah."
909160,912100," xxx videos."
912100,914580," So, we've got some subs and bits and boots."
914580,916560," Beats."
916560,918700," Say, thank you so much for all of the bits."
919380,921380," So, Howard Roark, 11."
921380,922540," Thank you so much for each prime."
922540,924820," Kalaedo, thank you so much for all of the bits."
924820,926420," With the message, a snackception."
926420,927040," Snackception."
927040,928060," Exception."
928060,928300," Indeed."
928300,930240," Artoryswear."
930240,931480," Thank you so much for five gifts."
931480,932100," Thank you."
932100,932340," Thank you."
932340,932600," Thank you."
932600,933400," And your tools."
933400,934520," Thank you so much for each prime."
935560,937880," I have no idea what that means."
937880,938700," But, thank you so much."
938700,939200," Thank you."
939200,939440," Thank you."
939440,939740," Thank you."
939740,942560," So, all right."
942560,945940," So, we can take a look at what the fuck is going on in there specifically."
945940,946300," Right."
946360,947980," So, the translate.py."
947980,949840," I'm really curious about that."
949840,951000," Right."
951000,956440," Let me find the file name, which is translate.py."
956440,957620," Let's take a look at it."
957620,958420," So, here it is."
958420,961400," And if we go into that specific file, right."
961400,963040," And it's at the line."
963040,964800," You can't probably see that."
964800,965080," Right."
965080,966020," You can't probably see that."
966020,967740," But it's at the line 99."
967740,970580," So, this is where it was happening."
970580,972060," So, okay."
972060,975020," So, load the target and target spec."
975600,978880," Translate the target as defined by target spec."
978880,979640," Right."
979640,980160," So, target."
980160,981740," I suppose this is the path."
981740,983980," So, target spec ends with pi."
983980,987300," If it doesn't end with pi, we just append pi."
987300,987720," Right."
987720,993740," So, that means we didn't even have to provide pi in here."
993740,996680," We didn't have to do that because it will do that automatically."
996680,997020," Right."
997020,998360," So, as you can see, I could have just."
998360,998920," Yeah."
998920,999800," I could have just say, okay."
999800,1000840," So, main."
1000840,1002660," That's pretty cool."
1002660,1003120," Right."
1003120,1005380," So, this is why I recommend reading the source code."
1005480,1005560," Right."
1005560,1010700," So, how would you know this really little silly fact if you didn't look into the source code?"
1010700,1011460," Right."
1011460,1013880," So, the source code is the best documentation."
1013880,1015540," That's what it is."
1015540,1016200," The best documentation."
1016200,1018380," So, then we have a sys modules."
1018380,1019020," I don't remember."
1019020,1022540," It's like we're taking the current module."
1022540,1023900," So, we're taking this module."
1023900,1025400," I didn't know about it, by the way."
1025400,1026740," This is actually kind of a cool trick."
1026740,1028240," So, can I kind of try to do that?"
1029020,1030200," So, Python 3."
1030200,1031880," So, sys."
1031880,1032660," Do we have sys?"
1032660,1033900," We have to import sys."
1033900,1034180," Right."
1034180,1035440," Sys modules."
1035440,1035920," Right."
1035920,1037400," So, oh, Jesus fucking Christ."
1037400,1039920," So, and then we take the current module."
1039920,1040360," Right."
1040360,1041540," So, this is the current module."
1041540,1043180," And what's inside of this current module?"
1043180,1045380," Sys itself."
1045380,1048140," It's a very self-referential."
1048140,1050280," It is very self-referential."
1050400,1053100," So, that means from within this thing, we can take sys."
1053100,1053980," Right."
1053980,1056600," And from within this thing, we can take modules."
1056600,1058580," And we can take the same module."
1058580,1062460," And we can confirm that these two things are the same."
1062460,1063800," Right."
1063800,1065540," Can we actually confirm that?"
1065540,1068280," Isn't that cool?"
1068280,1073260," That's pretty cool, isn't it?"
1079520,1080960," Normal step on Python, exactly."
1080960,1084640," PyPy."
1084640,1086840," Yeah, that's the definition of PyPy."
1086840,1087640," Okay, cool."
1087640,1091700," So, and in the modules, we find in the module translate."
1091700,1096100," And, yeah, so we just say it's this module."
1096100,1097380," Okay."
1097380,1098940," So, spec name."
1098940,1101800," Base name."
1101800,1103560," So, we're taking the base name."
1103560,1105520," We split the text."
1106960,1110720," And then we insert, and we do a bunch of manipulation like that."
1110720,1116120," And then, we import spec name."
1116120,1119440," So, there should be some sort of a spec in here."
1119440,1121240," Aha."
1121240,1125320," Some sort of a spec in here."
1125320,1127080," That's rather interesting."
1129080,1130540," System path insert."
1130540,1134160," I'm not sure how to interpret this entire thing."
1134160,1137420," Deer name."
1137420,1138420," Insert."
1138420,1140000," Spec name."
1140000,1144200," So, something about the spec."
1144200,1148800," So, it basically looks for the target in the current module."
1148800,1149660," Does it?"
1149660,1152280," Does it look for the target in the current module?"
1152280,1153740," What if we provided the target?"
1154480,1155440," That's a good point."
1155440,1156360," That's a good point."
1156360,1156580," Okay."
1156580,1160960," So, so, target your mom."
1160960,1161960," Let's go."
1161960,1166160," So, and let's try to actually run it."
1166160,1167960," Holy shit."
1167960,1168780," It actually worked."
1168780,1169940," Okay."
1169940,1173060," So, well, I mean, it kind of worked, but."
1173060,1176700," So, then it fails."
1176700,1177940," Is not callable."
1181480,1185820," It tries to call this entire thing."
1185820,1188060," All right."
1188060,1189360," So, stat debugger."
1189360,1191280," Let me actually read that."
1191280,1191980," So, error."
1191980,1194580," I guess that's the entirety."
1194580,1197800," So, it provides the driver and arguments."
1197800,1199000," Right."
1199000,1201740," So, it provides the driver and the arguments."
1201740,1202520," Okay."
1202520,1203920," That's very interesting."
1203920,1206600," Right."
1206600,1208440," So, let me see."
1208440,1210080," It also falls into the debugger."
1210440,1211980," You need a return function."
1211980,1212240," Yeah."
1212240,1213160," I can see that."
1213160,1214360," I can actually see that."
1214360,1215720," So, let's do define."
1215720,1217300," Right."
1217300,1220860," And it was actually accepting driver and args."
1220860,1221660," Right."
1221660,1227500," And one of the things we can do is maybe print driver."
1227500,1228100," Right."
1228100,1229440," Maybe something like this."
1229440,1230240," So, driver."
1230240,1232580," Driver."
1232580,1233940," Like so."
1234860,1237720," And this one is going to be args."
1237720,1239000," There we go."
1239000,1241220," Well, I mean, I want you to do that for all of them."
1241220,1241700," Thank you."
1241700,1242240," Thank you so much."
1242240,1245700," So, let's try to run this entire stuff."
1245700,1247980," And there we go."
1247980,1249240," So, driver."
1249240,1250740," So, it already says hello."
1250740,1253780," Holy shit."
1253780,1255200," It started shooting rainbows."
1255200,1274700," I have no idea what the fuck."
1274700,1276340," And then it failed."
1276340,1282460," Fucking hacked."
1282460,1282900," Yeah."
1282900,1283840," Fucking hacked."
1283840,1284140," Anyway."
1284140,1291440," We expected fucking anything but that."
1292600,1294800," So, all right."
1294800,1296380," So, what does it say?"
1296380,1299620," Okay."
1299620,1301120," That's pretty cool."
1301120,1305040," So, set platform host."
1305040,1305660," CC."
1305660,1307620," So, translation."
1307620,1309120," PyPy configuration."
1309120,1310760," GC."
1310760,1314400," Doesn't really say much to me."
1314400,1317120," Creating database for generating source code."
1317120,1318080," Jesus Christ."
1318080,1318700," Why is it?"
1318700,1320480," Specializing."
1320480,1322160," Specializing."
1322160,1323160," Specializing."
1323160,1327440," Loading targets."
1327440,1330560," And then it failed with an error."
1330560,1331380," All right."
1331380,1333040," And I wonder what kind of error."
1333040,1335640," Attempt to call constant none."
1335640,1338580," I feel like I just have to do something with those arguments."
1338580,1339420," That's the thing."
1339420,1339760," Right."
1339760,1342680," So, I got the driver and stuff like that."
1342680,1344960," The question is, what the fuck am I even doing with that?"
1344960,1350680," Or maybe there is some already existing targets that I could have just..."
1351720,1353000," Is used."
1353000,1353940," Right."
1353940,1357420," So, it would be kind of nice to have some kind of examples."
1357420,1359120," Right."
1359120,1360680," For this and that thing."
1360680,1361500," Maybe we can..."
1361500,1365040," Maybe we can find some information on the..."
1365040,1367780," On the website about this kind of stuff."
1367780,1368080," Right."
1368160,1369160," So, DevDocs."
1369160,1369300," So, DevDocs."
1369300,1373540," So, DevDocs."
1373540,1374660," R-Python."
1374660,1376180," R-Python."
1376180,1377000," What do we have?"
1377000,1379700," So, I have to actually press enter."
1379700,1380680," Get for condemnation."
1380680,1381340," So, it's searching."
1381340,1383520," It's not particularly useful."
1383520,1384940," It's not particularly useful."
1386680,1388520," So, let's go to here."
1388520,1389480," Right."
1389480,1392640," So, there's features about blog."
1392640,1398500," I guess we don't really have anything but DevDocs."
1401460,1405540," Does anybody see anything about R-Python?"
1405540,1407200," Python mixed module."
1407200,1409120," Explicit typing on R-Python."
1409120,1413920," Convert."
1413920,1414780," Okay."
1414780,1416900," So, convert R-Python to Python 3."
1422240,1425880," So, maybe R-Python language."
1425880,1428680," So, Python."
1428680,1430640," A step towards..."
1430640,1430980," All right."
1430980,1431880," So, here it is."
1431880,1434560," This is what I was looking for because I kind of remember this thing."
1434560,1435740," And it's not even..."
1435740,1437660," It's not even part of PyPy."
1437660,1438460," Here is the thing."
1438460,1438840," Right."
1438840,1440240," So, it's not even part of PyPy."
1440240,1446740," So, R-Python is a restricted subset of Python that is amenable to static analysis."
1446740,1451480," Although there are additions to the language and some things might surprisingly work."
1451600,1454380," This is a rough list of restrictions that should be considered."
1454380,1459940," Note that there are tons of special case restrictions that you will encounter as you go."
1459940,1464780," The exact definition is R-Python is everything that our translation toolchain can accept."
1464780,1468740," Look at you, Rust."
1468740,1470180," Look at you."
1470180,1471020," Right."
1471020,1472920," Isn't Rust doesn't even have any spec?"
1472920,1473380," Right."
1473380,1477720," So, the spec of Rust is just like whatever compiler supports or something."
1477720,1480860," I think it is."
1480960,1485220," So, we have something like that."
1485220,1488720," So, here is the thing that you can use in R-Python."
1488720,1489580," Cool."
1489580,1492080," So, exception rules."
1492080,1494480," For example, you have that."
1494480,1497700," Py is debuggable on top of CPython."
1497700,1498620," Has advantage."
1498620,1499280," Blah, blah, blah."
1499280,1501780," Okay."
1502520,1504060," So, frequently asked questions."
1504060,1504140," So, frequently asked questions."
1504140,1504140," So, frequently asked questions."
1504140,1504140," So, frequently asked questions."
1504140,1504140," So, frequently asked questions."
1504140,1505980," Question R-Login environment."
1505980,1509740," So, generally used for R-Python modules."
1509740,1512060," Okay."
1512060,1514080," That is very cool."
1514080,1516680," But I would like to have an example that..."
1516680,1517860," Getting started with R-Python."
1517860,1518860," Just an example."
1518860,1519180," Okay."
1519240,1521460," So, here is the file in R-Python."
1521460,1524580," Here is how you translate it to something."
1524580,1526800," I would like to have something like that."
1526800,1528360," All right."
1528360,1532260," So, R-Python is a subset of Python 2."
1532260,1533780," Right."
1533780,1536000," It is a subset of Python 2."
1536260,1537500," But, again..."
1537500,1538640," So, you may say..."
1538640,1539560," Eww, brother."
1539560,1541460," Eww, as much as you want."
1541460,1547980," But they implemented Python 3 in R-Python."
1547980,1551020," And they have their own Python 2 implementation."
1551020,1554340," So, it is totally fine, in a sense."
1554340,1555800," If you think about it."
1555800,1556340," Right."
1556340,1558140," So, they are still using Python 2."
1558140,1561640," But they are kind of maintaining it for themselves."
1561640,1563720," And, yeah."
1563720,1564540," It is kind of interesting."
1564540,1565540," Are they going to be actually..."
1566260,1568300," you know, changing R-Python"
1568300,1571820," and making it a subset of Python 3 at one point?"
1571820,1572300," Maybe not."
1572300,1572940," I don't really know."
1572940,1574900," Python 2 will never die."
1574900,1575480," Yeah."
1575480,1577000," It probably will never die."
1577000,1582240," So, I wonder if somebody still uses Python 1."
1582240,1586600," So, the rumors I heard about Python 1, by the way,"
1586600,1589260," is that Python 1 is so goddamn old."
1589260,1592140," Python, as a language, generally, is so goddamn old"
1592140,1596160," that Python 1 was originally developed for DOS."
1597000,1598680," That's how fucking old it is."
1598680,1602420," PyPy2 is actually a maintained Python 2 interpreter"
1602420,1604260," some people unironically use."
1604260,1605200," Huh."
1605200,1606140," I can actually see that."
1606140,1607580," Yeah."
1607580,1608020," Why not?"
1608020,1612920," So, I suppose, like, the official Python 2 interpreter"
1612920,1614280," is not really maintained anymore."
1614820,1617740," But since PyPy developers kind of need it"
1617740,1621540," because R-Python is a subset of Python 2,"
1621540,1625280," so you can kind of rely on, you know, PyPy2."
1625280,1628120," Time to fire."
1628120,1630260," Maybe I should do a stream about that."
1630260,1631200," Fuck."
1631200,1632340," That's such a cool idea."
1632340,1635300," Like, do a stream where you program in Python 1"
1635300,1636640," in DOS box or something."
1637600,1640220," So, people are suggesting some examples"
1640220,1641160," and stuff like that."
1641160,1642200," I don't know."
1642200,1643660," It doesn't look like official documentation."
1643660,1645260," But anyway."
1645260,1650180," So, we already got some stuff in here."
1650180,1654160," So, R-Python is a subset of Python 2"
1654160,1655620," that can be statically compiled."
1655620,1658720," The PyPy interpreter is written mostly in R-Python"
1658720,1660640," with pieces in Python"
1660640,1663660," while the R-Python compiler is written in Python."
1663660,1665820," Oh, that's very interesting."
1665820,1668120," So, R-Python is not implemented in itself."
1668120,1668680," Right."
1668680,1670360," So, okay."
1670360,1673360," The hard to understand part is that"
1673360,1676120," Python is a metaprogramming language for R-Python."
1676120,1678120," That is, being valid R-Python"
1678120,1680120," is a question that only makes sense"
1680120,1682720," on the live object"
1682720,1685340," after the imports are done."
1685340,1689300," So, this might require more explanation."
1689300,1693880," You start writing R-Python from entry point."
1693880,1696320," A good starting point is"
1696320,1699080," R-Python translation goal target"
1699080,1701400," NOP standalone."
1701400,1704260," This doesn't do all that much"
1704260,1705740," but is a start."
1705740,1708100," Now, if you code analyze,"
1708100,1709720," in that case, entry point,"
1710060,1710560," calls,"
1710560,1712820," now, if code analyzed,"
1712820,1714340," calls some functions,"
1714340,1715780," those calls will be followed."
1715780,1717780," Those followed calls"
1717780,1720020," have to be R-Python themselves"
1720020,1722580," and everything they call, etc."
1722580,1725020," However, not entire module files."
1725660,1727840," To show how you can use metaprogramming,"
1727840,1729900," we can do a silly example."
1729900,1730940," Okay."
1730940,1732840," So, here is this thing."
1732840,1734220," Oh, look at that."
1734220,1734940," This is a target."
1734940,1735760," This is a target."
1735760,1736440," This is a target."
1736440,1737240," Holy shit."
1737240,1737960," We have an example."
1737960,1739740," And this example is actually,"
1739740,1740420," you know,"
1740480,1741340," part of this thing."
1741340,1743420," A simple standalone target."
1743420,1745240," The target below specifies"
1745240,1749760," none as the argument type types list."
1749760,1752040," This is a case treated specifically"
1752040,1753880," in driver.py."
1753880,1756900," If the list of input types is empty,"
1756900,1758620," it is meant to be list of strings."
1758620,1760700," Actually implemented arg of executable."
1760700,1761300," Right."
1761360,1762820," So, you have functions like debug."
1762820,1764920," You have an entry point"
1764920,1767440," where you probably actually write your code."
1767440,1768360," And this is why"
1768360,1770480," when we're trying to interpret"
1770480,1771580," some of the shit in here,"
1771580,1774800," it basically printed hello world right away"
1774800,1777120," because it just loaded this module."
1777120,1779740," But this is not how you compile this entire thing."
1779740,1780800," Right."
1780800,1783120," So, I suppose it compiles"
1783120,1785040," only the things starting from entry point"
1785040,1785740," or something like that."
1785740,1786740," That's very interesting."
1786740,1788200," Right."
1788200,1789520," So, here's the entry point."
1789520,1790760," You do debug hello world."
1791260,1792140," And then..."
1792140,1793000," Right."
1793000,1793960," Huh."
1793960,1796260," That is fascinating."
1796260,1797200," Okay."
1797200,1798820," What if I just like copy paste"
1798820,1799640," this entire thing?"
1799640,1801660," I really want to try that."
1801660,1802900," Chat, chat."
1802900,1804120," Right."
1804120,1805260," I really want to try that."
1805260,1806940," So, fuck all that choice."
1806940,1808580," I'm going to copy paste"
1808580,1810440," this entire thing in here."
1810440,1811020," Boom."
1811020,1817760," Why Veeam did that?"
1817760,1819820," Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?"
1821160,1826140," Like, I just pressed shift insert"
1826140,1827480," and it just did that shit."
1827480,1830040," Can your Emacs do that?"
1830040,1834700," What the fuck is wrong with me?"
1834700,1837720," Do I have, like, a real Veeam in here?"
1837720,1840420," I have a real Veeam in here."
1840420,1841900," Do you guys know about NVI?"
1841900,1844280," Do you guys know about NVI?"
1844960,1846580," This is actually Veeam,"
1846580,1847260," Veeam, Veeam,"
1847260,1849400," that acts like a regional Veeam,"
1849400,1852020," including not having syntax highlighting"
1852020,1852980," and shit like that."
1852980,1854920," And it's not now Veeam."
1854920,1856540," It's like a regional Veeam."
1856540,1857840," Right."
1857840,1859300," So, it's kind of funny."
1859300,1860860," Who needs now Veeam"
1860860,1862200," when you have NVI?"
1863340,1863760," Right."
1863760,1864920," So, yeah."
1864920,1866640," It doesn't even have a..."
1866640,1868680," Bro, it doesn't have a visual mode."
1868680,1869460," Look at this shit."
1869460,1872040," Veeam isn't a VI command."
1872040,1874800," It's so goddamn old school."
1874800,1876940," It doesn't have a visual mode."
1876940,1878740," You can't select shit."
1880500,1882120," This is the original VI."
1882120,1884360," We can use ED, actually."
1884360,1884820," Right."
1884820,1886940," So, main.py."
1886940,1887820," Right."
1887820,1889620," So, ED main.py."
1889620,1890220," Right."
1890220,1893580," So, the way you use ED,"
1893580,1894920," you press A,"
1894920,1896800," and you go into the insert mode,"
1896800,1898060," actually append mode."
1898060,1898740," Right."
1898740,1899300," So, then,"
1899300,1903180," you can simply copy-paste a thing."
1903180,1905140," This is actually not what I wanted to copy-paste."
1905140,1906320," Can I just copy-paste?"
1906320,1907700," Ooh."
1909280,1911460," This was not the Veeam's fault."
1911460,1914380," This was the..."
1914380,1915720," This website's fault."
1915720,1918860," Okay."
1918860,1921040," So, I can copy the file contents."
1921040,1922700," All right."
1922700,1924760," Okay."
1924760,1929460," Remove main."
1929460,1930100," So, yeah."
1930100,1931820," We only have this, I think."
1931820,1933380," So, KD main.py."
1933380,1934600," A."
1934600,1935820," All right."
1935820,1938680," I explicitly copy-paste"
1938680,1940000," this entire thing."
1940000,1942720," And it still doesn't work."
1942720,1944620," Finally."
1944620,1945440," Right."
1945440,1947680," So, just selecting this entire thing"
1947680,1950460," will actually not produce a good code."
1950460,1951340," Right."
1951340,1952920," So, then, I can put dot."
1952920,1954420," By pressing dot,"
1954420,1956980," you actually get out of the insert mode."
1956980,1958140," Then, you press W,"
1958140,1960040," and it actually tells you,"
1960040,1961740," like, how many characters it's saved,"
1961740,1962800," and then you can quit."
1962800,1964160," That's how we use"
1964160,1966220," the standard text editor."
1966220,1967300," None of that"
1967300,1968960," Zoomer now Veeam shit."
1968960,1969700," Okay."
1969700,1971880," This is how real programmers"
1971880,1972980," write code."
1972980,1976520," Anyways."
1976520,1977720," All right."
1977720,1979280," So, then we can open this thing"
1979280,1980500," and here it is, actually."
1980500,1981500," So, anyway."
1981500,1984480," So, let's try to translate this shit."
1984480,1984900," All right."
1984900,1987080," So, let's see if it's going to do the thing."
1987200,1988500," So, starting annotate."
1988500,1990120," So, it's annotating something."
1990120,1991780," Is it going to shed rainbows?"
1991780,1993060," It's shedding rainbows."
1993060,1994120," Hallelujah."
1994120,1996860," It's shedding rainbows."
1996860,1998380," Amen."
1998380,2002040," Holy fuck."
2002040,2004900," This is the best part of our Python."
2004900,2006040," I swear to God."
2006040,2007620," It's just like you run it"
2007620,2008900," and it's shedding rainbows"
2008900,2009600," all over the place."
2009600,2010620," It's fucking good."
2010620,2014320," And it did it in 21 seconds."
2014320,2015820," We compiled Hello World"
2015820,2017200," in 21 seconds."
2017200,2025800," Oh, holy shit."
2025800,2027560," We've got a main suit."
2027560,2028700," Look at that."
2028700,2030280," Look at fucking that."
2030280,2030940," LDD."
2030940,2032280," And, oh shit."
2032280,2032660," Okay."
2032660,2036160," So, and we can take a look at the file."
2036160,2036900," It seems to me."
2036900,2039780," Hello World."
2039780,2042040," Prefixed with a debug."
2042040,2044500," So, yeah."
2044800,2046720," We have a Python program, right?"
2046720,2048840," So, that had to kind of adhere"
2048840,2050840," to some like a little bit"
2050840,2052320," of a bureaucratic things, right?"
2052320,2053940," So, you have to have like a driver."
2053940,2056100," You have to have an entry point"
2056100,2058420," and so on and so forth, right?"
2058420,2060980," But it created an actually native executable,"
2060980,2061800," which is kind of cool,"
2061800,2063440," which is actually kind of cool."
2063440,2066640," And it feels absolutely fucking unnecessary, honestly."
2066840,2068140," You could have just like implemented it"
2068140,2070440," in any native language."
2070440,2075460," But I suppose they just want you to do that for a meme."
2075460,2079320," Like, it's absolutely fucking unnecessary, isn't it?"
2079320,2082020," Like, what's the point of going through the trouble"
2082020,2085000," of creating this subset and translator for the subset"
2085000,2085700," and so on?"
2085700,2086880," It feels like a meme."
2086880,2089540," Is there really any necessity of doing that?"
2090380,2091740," You could have just like implemented it"
2091740,2092640," in like in C++"
2092640,2095060," or I don't know if Rust was a thing back then."
2095060,2097800," They did it for the beat."
2097800,2099140," Yeah, I understand that."
2099140,2101140," Honestly, I fucking respect that."
2101140,2102700," Just for the meme, right?"
2102700,2105000," So, because we have a Python implemented in Python."
2105000,2105860," Dope, dope, dope."
2105860,2108740," Oh, can your C do that?"
2108740,2110200," Can your JavaScript do that?"
2110200,2112940," Yeah, it's actually really great"
2112940,2114780," to dunk on JavaScript"
2114780,2119360," to show how fucking toy of a scripting language that is."
2119360,2122160," Do you have a JavaScript interpreter"
2122160,2123520," implemented in JavaScript?"
2123520,2125300," I don't fucking think so."
2125300,2127760," We have a Python interpreter implemented in Python."
2127760,2130180," This is a real serious programming language."
2130180,2133380," None of that toy shit for web devs."
2133380,2134620," You know what I'm talking about?"
2134620,2135560," You know what I'm talking about?"
2135560,2136440," You know what I'm talking about."
2136440,2139140," So, anyway, so that's pretty cool."
2139140,2140640," And it feels like,"
2141660,2143140," So, what's funny is that"
2143140,2146300," this target just returns the entry point."
2146300,2149100," So, which is kind of bizarre."
2149100,2150400," So, maybe, like,"
2150400,2152180," do we have to even do anything here?"
2152180,2152540," Maybe?"
2152540,2153540," I don't fucking know."
2153540,2156300," So, what if I..."
2156300,2158620," So, I can just do print, as you can see."
2158620,2159020," Right?"
2159020,2159960," So, I can just do print."
2159960,2162160," So, let me do hello world."
2162160,2165540," Just without any of that shit."
2165540,2166720," Right?"
2166720,2168920," So, and I want to also remove the syntactic."
2168920,2170020," But on top of that,"
2170700,2172180," I also want to"
2172180,2175140," just do run."
2175140,2177760," Can I do in range 10?"
2177760,2179060," Right."
2179060,2180080," And then just do that."
2180080,2182640," Does anybody know,"
2182640,2184220," is this a valid Python 2?"
2184220,2185620," I'm actually not sure."
2185620,2187360," Maybe it's not a valid Python 2."
2187360,2187960," But we'll see."
2187960,2189700," All right."
2189700,2190660," So, let's fucking go."
2196360,2197200," Hell yeah."
2197200,2197780," Rainbow."
2197780,2200300," Rainbow."
2200300,2202880," Let's fucking go."
2202880,2206180," Man, this is so fucking fun."
2206180,2210060," What is it fucking..."
2210060,2212020," Why is it outputting all of that stuff?"
2212020,2213180," Okay."
2213180,2213920," I have no idea."
2213920,2214920," It's so bizarre."
2214920,2217380," It's so quirky and weird."
2217380,2218520," Like, holy shit."
2219120,2219500," All right."
2219500,2220560," So, if I try to run..."
2220560,2221960," And it's actually printed at 10 times."
2221960,2222500," Look at that."
2222500,2223680," Look at that."
2223680,2227640," I can program native applications in Python."
2227640,2231500," The next question is..."
2231500,2234660," Can I link this stuff with C libraries?"
2234660,2237740," Can I call C functions?"
2241740,2255760," I don't fucking know."
2255760,2256980," That sounds interesting, actually."
2256980,2258920," ArrayPy."
2258920,2260740," So, let me actually see."
2260740,2263380," How can you interact with C steps?"
2263380,2267320," So, are Python a language?"
2267320,2269420," So, this is an example."
2269420,2270760," This is the generator."
2271740,2273320," And so on and so forth."
2273320,2276480," We didn't even finish reading this paragraph, honestly."
2276480,2278960," This doesn't do all that much."
2278960,2279840," But it's a start."
2279840,2282640," Now, if code analyzes, in this case,"
2282640,2285560," ngpoint calls some functions."
2285560,2286920," Those calls will be followed."
2286920,2291160," Those followed calls have to be RPython themselves"
2291160,2292680," and everything they call."
2292680,2294540," However, not an entire module file."
2294540,2296160," To show how you can use..."
2296160,2296600," Oh, right."
2296600,2297620," We actually read it."
2297620,2298860," I forgot about that."
2298860,2300120," In this example,"
2300680,2302000," entry point is RPython."
2302000,2302500," Okay."
2302500,2303940," So, entry point is RPython."
2303940,2305600," We're called to add and sub"
2305600,2306640," and so on and so forth."
2306640,2308080," And and sub are RPython."
2308080,2309820," However, generator is not."
2309820,2311980," So, the following..."
2311980,2312340," Okay."
2312340,2314440," So, that's very interesting."
2314440,2316580," So, what that means..."
2316580,2317880," Oh!"
2323300,2325100," So, okay."
2325100,2327720," This thing itself is not,"
2327720,2332980," but it will generate valid functions."
2332980,2339260," That is bizarre."
2339260,2342860," Try now the translator."
2342860,2343260," Okay."
2344840,2349360," So, the translator is a tool based on the PyPy interpreter,"
2349360,2353280," which can translate sufficiently static RPython programs"
2353280,2354540," into lower-level code."
2354540,2357520," In particular, it can be used to translate full Python interpreter."
2357520,2359360," To be able to experiment with it,"
2359360,2365480," you need to download and install the usual CPython 2 version of Py game."
2365600,2366000," Well, I mean,"
2366000,2367960," we already have like a Python 2 version,"
2367960,2368940," like PyPy 2."
2368940,2369760," Right."
2369760,2372480," So, you see D into RPython"
2372480,2375080," and you use bin, translator, or shell."
2375080,2378120," Is that what you fucking do?"
2378120,2380220," This is not how we did that."
2380220,2380920," You have bin..."
2380920,2382280," You have bin in here."
2382280,2383580," And okay."
2383580,2385060," So, translator or..."
2385060,2389140," You just have fucking RPython bin in here,"
2389140,2391060," which..."
2391060,2397240," And I was calling it through..."
2397240,2399500," Why was I doing it like that?"
2399500,2403420," So, wait, RPython has own FFI."
2403420,2404960," Oh, that's actually kind of cool."
2404960,2408060," So, it has a RPython executable,"
2408060,2411620," but I was calling RPython by just providing the folder"
2411620,2413060," because the folder has main..."
2413060,2415040," Well, it doesn't really matter, right?"
2415060,2417100," So, you basically end up with the same shit anyway."
2417100,2418020," Don't you?"
2418020,2419340," Yeah."
2419340,2420900," I think it's the same shit."
2420900,2421560," It doesn't really matter."
2421560,2422600," Okay."
2422600,2425400," So, test snippets of translatable code are provided in..."
2425400,2428940," Holy fucking shit."
2428940,2429680," We have examples."
2429680,2430340," Finally."
2430340,2431380," Examples."
2431380,2433460," Eggs fucking apples."
2433460,2434620," Eggs fucking apples."
2434620,2435740," Snippets for translators."
2435740,2437820," This module holds various snippets"
2437820,2439840," to be used by translator unit tests."
2439840,2440700," Uh-huh."
2440700,2441040," Uh-huh."
2441040,2441460," Uh-huh."
2441460,2443060," Okay."
2443060,2446600," So, these are various translatable snippets."
2446600,2447780," Snippets."
2447780,2449820," Uh-huh."
2449820,2450200," Okay."
2450200,2451220," Okay."
2451220,2453220," So, all right."
2453220,2453740," So, whatever."
2453740,2455940," Um..."
2455940,2457400," So, translator is snippet perfect."
2457400,2459600," Uh..."
2459600,2461580," Try now type annotator."
2461580,2462680," I don't give a shit."
2462680,2465960," So, translating the flow graph to C code."
2465960,2467280," I don't give a shit."
2467280,2468480," Okay."
2468480,2469900," Uh-huh."
2469900,2472220," So, producer executable standalone."
2472220,2474540," We already actually kind of tried that,"
2474540,2475960," but with our own thing."
2475960,2477440," Um..."
2477440,2478900," So, translating full programs."
2478900,2479840," To the same full programs."
2479840,2482440," There is a script or Python examples."
2482440,2483480," Uh..."
2483480,2486660," For this are slightly changed version of PyStone."
2486660,2488000," Ooh."
2488000,2489920," So, translator goal."
2489920,2492200," Uh-huh."
2493740,2494140," Uh..."
2494140,2494540," Target."
2494540,2495740," Ooh."
2495740,2497740," So, basically, these, like..."
2497740,2501020," Have different, like, R's."
2501020,2503680," You know, R's to PyStone."
2503680,2505060," Hmm."
2505060,2507940," It's just..."
2507940,2509580," I don't fucking understand, mate."
2509580,2510760," I don't fucking understand."
2510760,2512180," Uh..."
2512180,2512560," But, anyway."
2512560,2513840," So, I think, um..."
2513840,2514940," I should not look into that."
2514940,2516540," Um..."
2516540,2517860," Try now the translator."
2518060,2519160," So, they're talking about, like,"
2519160,2520320," their internal things"
2520320,2523760," that are probably not of that much of a use for us."
2523760,2526660," So, I'm not sure."
2526660,2527440," I'm not sure."
2527440,2528180," Uh..."
2528180,2528940," You know what I want to do?"
2528940,2529880," You know what I want to do?"
2529880,2530580," Uh..."
2530580,2532200," I want to make a small break"
2532200,2533620," and refill my KappaT."
2533620,2534280," Right."
2534280,2535720," So, I need to refill my KappaT."
2535720,2536680," And after the KappaT,"
2536680,2539840," we can try to see how we can, uh..."
2539840,2541960," maybe link with Synchro."
2543440,2544180," I don't know."
2544180,2545360," Is that a good idea?"
2545360,2547640," Right."
2547640,2548940," So, we can try."
2548940,2549700," It's kind of fun."
2549700,2550200," Right."
2550200,2552180," So, it's just..."
2552180,2555200," So stressed that he needs two KappaT."
2555200,2555700," Well, I mean,"
2555700,2556960," we're only streaming for one hour."
2556960,2557960," Usually, at that time,"
2557960,2559560," I'm already, like, doing a break."
2559560,2561560," Actually, we did, like,"
2561560,2562360," a pretty huge intro."
2562360,2564060," So, I'm not really streaming for one hour,"
2564060,2565100," at least for YouTube people."
2565100,2565540," But, anyway."
2565540,2568660," So, let's actually quickly refill the KappaT."
2568660,2569780," Alright."
2569780,2571820," So, let's take a look at the source code"
2571820,2573160," of PyPy itself."
2573440,2573660," Right."
2573660,2574580," So, how..."
2574580,2575360," Excuse me."
2575360,2576420," Is it even implemented?"
2576420,2577740," What's funny,"
2577740,2579840," it also has a folder called Py."
2579840,2583540," I've no idea what this folder is about."
2583540,2585140," Read before updating."
2585140,2586440," Okay."
2586440,2591740," So, this is PyPy's code of the PyLib."
2591740,2594800," We don't expect to upgrade it very often,"
2594800,2596320," but once we do..."
2596320,2596640," Warning!"
2596640,2598780," We have made a few tweaks here."
2598780,2601440," Please be sure that you don't just copy"
2601440,2603300," the newer versions from AppStream"
2603300,2606280," without checking the few changes that we did."
2606280,2607860," This can be done like this."
2607860,2610380," So, they're using Mercurial?"
2610380,2612260," Damn."
2612260,2615760," Do you guys know about HG?"
2615760,2618580," So, it's just like a Mercurial..."
2618580,2619580," Mercurial..."
2619580,2621940," So, version control system."
2622780,2624180," So, that's old."
2624180,2626340," So, they don't use Mercurial anymore."
2626340,2630780," Mercurial is bog, but I never got to use it."
2630780,2631120," Yeah."
2631120,2634980," So, it's just Linus with his authority"
2634980,2637380," actually forced everyone to use Git."
2637380,2640880," So, Mercurial kind of died because of that."
2640880,2644720," Mercurial kind of died because of that."
2645120,2646060," So, anyways."
2646060,2650020," Let me see."
2650020,2652140," So, this is our Python."
2652140,2654960," So, I don't know what the fuck it is."
2654960,2655340," Right."
2655340,2657280," So, I'm going to just leave it as this."
2657280,2658760," So, let's take a look at PyPy."
2658760,2662180," So, and in terms of PyPy, does it have a..."
2662180,2664760," So, the thing we know about our Python applications"
2664760,2670300," is that they basically have an entry point"
2670300,2673220," or some sort of a driver or something like that."
2673220,2676900," And I wonder if there is a file"
2676900,2680300," where you have a driver..."
2680300,2681180," It's not a driver."
2681180,2685100," It's a target function defined anywhere."
2685100,2687260," So, one of the things we can do in here,"
2687260,2689500," we can actually do grep def target."
2689500,2690280," Right."
2690280,2691860," So, is def target..."
2691860,2692760," Okay, it is actually."
2692760,2693220," Look at that."
2693220,2697100," Oh, it's goal."
2697100,2700100," Target PyPy stand..."
2700100,2700980," Ooh."
2700980,2703600," So, this is actually a very interesting convention."
2703600,2703920," Right."
2703920,2706160," So, the convention for this kind of things,"
2706160,2707600," for this kind of application,"
2707600,2710480," is to have goal folder."
2710480,2711420," Right."
2711420,2713880," And within the goals, you have target"
2713880,2716700," and then some sort of a name of the goal."
2716700,2718640," You guys remember the error message"
2718640,2723300," that was not a valid target XXX Py whatever."
2723300,2724340," Right."
2724340,2726020," Because that's the convention."
2726020,2726440," Right."
2726440,2729680," So, target and then name of the target,"
2729820,2730680," whatever the fuck it is."
2730680,2732520," And here is the PyPy stand-alone."
2732520,2735980," And it does, in fact, have the driver."
2735980,2737180," Right."
2737180,2737980," Dev driver."
2737980,2739800," Where is it?"
2739800,2741180," I don't see it."
2741180,2741380," Wait."
2741380,2741680," Wait."
2741680,2742840," There was a..."
2742840,2743940," I keep forgetting the target."
2743940,2746080," I don't know why I keep calling it driver."
2746080,2747660," I think I'm insane."
2747660,2750320," Where is the dev target?"
2750320,2751100," Yeah."
2751100,2752980," Because it has a parameter target."
2752980,2753580," Right."
2753580,2755120," But it's actually..."
2755120,2755340," Yeah."
2755340,2756380," So, PyPy target."
2756380,2756840," Huh."
2756840,2757400," Fascinating."
2757400,2761580," Target interface globals."
2761580,2766700," So, I suppose maybe it exports some of these things into globals."
2766700,2767940," What the fuck is interface?"
2768880,2772080," So, it iterates through all of these names."
2772080,2773760," Right."
2773760,2775240," And within the namespace..."
2775240,2776620," Ah."
2776620,2777840," Okay."
2777840,2779640," So, this is such a weird code."
2779640,2780240," Right."
2780240,2783380," So, there is a class PyPy target."
2783380,2785960," We create an object out of that."
2785960,2788480," And we call a method interfaces with globals."
2788580,2790840," And globals, if I'm not mistaken..."
2790840,2793160," So, it has to be maybe Python 3."
2793160,2794760," But, I mean, globals."
2794760,2795780," Right."
2795780,2799560," It's basically a dictionary of all globals."
2799560,2799900," Right."
2799900,2801780," So, and what we're doing..."
2801780,2810260," We are basically injecting some of the local names in here into that namespace specifically."
2810260,2813660," And one of the names that we're injecting is the target."
2813660,2815360," Right."
2815360,2817320," So, which is part of the..."
2817320,2819400," This is a really weird way of doing that."
2819400,2823940," Why don't you just have it defined at the top level?"
2823940,2825920," Why does it have to be a class?"
2825920,2827780," Is that because it has..."
2827780,2831700," Probably because it encloses some of the values in here."
2831700,2835300," But you could have just made them global values instead."
2835300,2841040," What the hell is wrong with OOP people?"
2841040,2841940," Can anybody tell me?"
2841940,2843220," Why do people do it like that?"
2843220,2846640," So, it's a Pythonic way of doing it."
2846640,2847160," Is it really?"
2847320,2848940," Is it really Pythonic way of doing that?"
2848940,2849480," But anyway."
2849480,2851160," All right."
2851160,2853940," So, let's take a look at the dev targets."
2853940,2855140," Right."
2855140,2856180," So, what we're doing here."
2856180,2857980," So, we take a driver."
2857980,2859020," Oh."
2859020,2864940," And through driver and arguments, we can actually control some of the compilation situation."
2864940,2866060," Right."
2866120,2867140," So, we can say an XZ name."
2867140,2867980," So, we can say an XZ name."
2867980,2871200," That's actually kind of fucking cool."
2871200,2873300," Can I do that somehow?"
2873300,2875140," Right."
2875140,2877220," So, I have a main.py."
2877220,2878340," All right."
2878340,2880860," So, and in the target, I just returned an entry point."
2880860,2882000," Nothing particularly special."
2882400,2885580," But then, I know that I accept driver in here."
2885580,2887020," Whatever the fuck it is."
2887020,2888520," All right."
2888520,2889940," So, and look at that."
2889940,2894060," So, it's a driver args and a driver XZ."
2894060,2896020," What was that?"
2896020,2896900," XZ name."
2896900,2897640," Right."
2897680,2898940," So, I can say XZ name."
2898940,2902740," And I can specify a version and stuff like that."
2902740,2904380," And obviously, I can say, okay, your mom."
2904380,2905000," Right."
2905000,2908820," So, basically, your mom."
2908820,2914380," Let's actually put like I in here and maybe do something like, I don't pretty know."
2914380,2915220," Can I do something like that?"
2915220,2916240," Is that a valid Python?"
2916240,2917960," Is that even a valid Python?"
2917960,2918760," I'm not sure."
2918760,2920280," But anyway."
2920280,2923820," So, they also take the driver config."
2923820,2927080," They parse some parameters and shit like that."
2927320,2928900," So, that's understandable."
2928900,2930780," So, that probably goes into the driver."
2930780,2935360," And does it end with returning the entry points somehow?"
2935360,2936220," I wonder."
2936220,2936880," Okay."
2936880,2939920," So, it does, in fact, end with returning entry points."
2939920,2943180," You get entry points from the config and stuff like that."
2943180,2945180," So, the target."
2945180,2948320," I think I understand the point of this target."
2948320,2951820," It kind of configures the build."
2951820,2952840," Right."
2952840,2954360," So, the driver has a bunch of things."
2954360,2955320," You set them up."
2955320,2957140," You configure them."
2957180,2958400," And so on and so forth."
2958400,2959540," Right."
2959540,2961320," And then you just return the entry point."
2961320,2965500," And then the translator using all of that stuff to create an executable."
2965500,2971480," This is weirdly similar to how Jai compilation works, actually."
2971480,2974880," Believe it or not."
2975460,2975820," Right."
2975820,2982880," So, Jai doesn't really have any separate build system or anything like that."
2982880,2985360," You always build your project."
2985360,2988280," You always build your project with just Jai."
2988740,2992320," And, you know, usually it has like a first dot Jai."
2992320,3006560," And within that first dot Jai, you can have compile time snippets that modify the current compilation environment and can set some of the parameters of the compilation on the fly."
3007020,3008800," And that's how you configure your build."
3008800,3014760," Not through the flags, but through compile time parameters."
3014760,3015940," Right."
3017500,3022520," So, you can even set libraries using RFFI here."
3022520,3025160," Oh, that's so fucking cool."
3025160,3026180," Yeah."
3026180,3030380," So, here I can say, okay, I can probably say what I can link with."
3030600,3035120," And that brings us back to Rayleap speedrun."
3035120,3038660," I'm so sorry."
3038660,3041940," I'm so fucking sorry."
3041940,3044380," People probably already hate me for doing Rayleap."
3044380,3046780," But, I mean, here's the thing."
3046780,3046980," Okay."
3046980,3047260," Okay."
3047260,3047760," All right."
3047760,3051160," I understand that doing Rayleap speedrun is such a fucking meme."
3051160,3056840," But, honestly, it's a very good test of how useful the language is."
3057260,3064680," It's like doing the Rayleap speedrun is the bare minimum of what useful language has to be."
3064680,3065860," Right."
3065860,3072620," If your language has any use in real world, it should be able to support Rayleap."
3072620,3073260," Right."
3073260,3074500," It's just like a bare minimum."
3074500,3075480," Sort of."
3075480,3076500," You know what I mean?"
3076500,3077040," Right."
3077040,3079020," It's kind of a meme, but at the same time."
3079020,3079260," Right."
3079260,3080600," So, are you a useful language?"
3080600,3083300," Can you interact with the C code and stuff like that?"
3083300,3084440," Right."
3084440,3088240," If so, okay, so we can actually use all of these libraries and everything."
3088240,3091080," Rayleap speedrun in regex."
3091080,3092480," Well, I can try to do that."
3092480,3095580," I can try to hack, like, PRCE library."
3095580,3099760," You know, like, yeah."
3099760,3102340," So, regex."
3102340,3103620," How is it called?"
3103620,3104220," PCRE."
3104220,3107300," I keep forgetting how it's actually called PCRE."
3107780,3110120," Similarly, how I hacked M4."
3110120,3111980," Right."
3111980,3113260," So, yeah."
3113260,3114620," I can try to do that."
3114620,3118160," Holy shit."
3118160,3120300," Rayleap and brainfuck would have been..."
3120300,3120500," Oh."
3120500,3122580," Oh, my fucking goodness."
3122580,3124340," This would be..."
3124340,3126320," I think I can pull that off."
3126320,3126760," Shit."
3126760,3129780," I think I can unironically pull that off."
3129780,3132720," Rayleap and brainfuck."
3136180,3138340," We have so many cool ideas."
3138340,3139760," We have so many cool ideas."
3139760,3143740," Rayfuck."
3143740,3145100," Okay, I'm sorry."
3145100,3146460," Anyways."
3146460,3147500," Anyways."
3147500,3148000," Anyways."
3148000,3148580," Anyways."
3148580,3153900," So, let's actually see if, like, setting the executable name actually works."
3153900,3154600," All right."
3154600,3157620," So, what was the..."
3157620,3163340," Mine, main, main, something, main.py."
3163340,3164600," So, where is it?"
3164600,3166740," Ah, here it is."
3166740,3167300," I found."
3167300,3171820," Freaking bash."
3171820,3173280," Freaking bash."
3173280,3174100," I swear to god."
3174100,3174440," Anyways."
3174440,3179140," So, let's try to do two bin, py, py."
3179340,3180660," So, here is the py, py."
3180660,3183220," And so, this is r python."
3183220,3184020," All right."
3184020,3186840," And then, in here, I do main.py."
3186840,3190500," So, let's just enjoy the rainbow."
3190500,3192600," Taste the rainbow."
3192600,3194440," Let's fucking go."
3199060,3210460," Okay."
3210460,3210860," Cool."
3210860,3214220," I don't see your..."
3214220,3214880," Here is your..."
3214880,3216220," Oh, holy fuck."
3216220,3217500," It actually created you."
3217500,3221580," I can control shit through the driver."
3221580,3224080," It makes so much fucking sense now."
3224080,3225080," Holy fuck."
3225080,3227660," It makes so much fucking sense."
3228200,3229240," Here is an interesting thing."
3229240,3233220," Can I, like, control whether I compile the current thing or not?"
3233220,3235660," So, what if I return none?"
3235660,3237420," Just return none."
3237420,3239380," What is going to happen?"
3239380,3243400," I expect that it's just not going to compile properly."
3243400,3246120," All right."
3246120,3246940," So, it's doing things."
3246940,3249520," It's still compiling, right?"
3249520,3251520," So, I suppose it's not..."
3251520,3252920," What does it do so much?"
3252920,3255300," Like, it's basically an empty program, isn't it?"
3255300,3257720," It's still doing all that stuff."
3258200,3261080," All right."
3261080,3265800," And it failed because it's a constant none and everything."
3265800,3266040," Okay."
3266040,3266940," So, that's understandable."
3266940,3269980," So, it's probably preparing the runtime or something."
3269980,3272320," But anyway, one of the things I wanted to do..."
3272320,3274940," I just wanted to take a look at the internals of the driver."
3274940,3278180," Or, better yet, can I just put a help on it?"
3279840,3280240," Right."
3280240,3281200," So, none is not..."
3281200,3282320," Yeah, none is not callable."
3282320,3284700," Should have actually maybe returned lambda or something like that."
3284700,3290020," But anyway, we can actually just do help and just see what's going on in there."
3290020,3291000," Because it's Python, right?"
3291000,3291800," So, it is..."
3291800,3292340," Oh, there we go."
3292980,3296260," So, it's pretty cool."
3296260,3299220," So, create exe."
3299220,3300580," So, you can..."
3300580,3302620," There's a bunch of methods."
3302620,3303580," But can we..."
3303580,3307700," So, it is exeName."
3307700,3308340," Right."
3308340,3309580," So, here is exeName."
3311440,3312060," All right."
3312060,3314280," So, there is a bunch of parameters in here."
3314280,3316100," Yeah."
3316100,3318620," So, exeName is actually part of this thing."
3318620,3323240," It doesn't really tell us that much about what kind of parameters we can modify in here."
3323240,3325460," I don't really see exeName or anything."
3325460,3327860," Unfortunately."
3327860,3329760," Unfortunately."
3329760,3330920," So."
3330920,3332520," Yeah."
3332520,3334900," So, maybe I can just, like, do it like that."
3334900,3335760," Did I..."
3335760,3336640," Did I just..."
3336640,3339260," I think I accidentally actually removed the t-mix session."
3339260,3339520," Okay."
3339520,3339780," Okay."
3340860,3341680," But anyways."
3341680,3343480," So, maybe we can try to do dir."
3343480,3347420," And as far as I know, dir doesn't really print anything."
3347420,3348700," Right."
3348700,3352780," So, if I import math, for instance, and if I do dir, it just returns."
3352780,3356820," So, if I'm doing that in this environment, I probably have to do something like this."
3356820,3358560," Right."
3358560,3360840," So, let's go ahead and try to do that."
3360840,3362040," So, okay."
3362040,3363080," I think I did it."
3363080,3364660," So, I just have to scroll up."
3364660,3367280," Where is it?"
3367280,3368140," I don't see it."
3368140,3368920," Fuck."
3370280,3371700," Oh, here they are."
3371700,3374700," Here are all of the parameters that we have in here."
3374700,3377300," So, compute.exe."
3377300,3377780," Yeah."
3377780,3379460," So, here's the exeName."
3379460,3380620," Done."
3380620,3381700," Exposed."
3381700,3383380," Ext mode name."
3383380,3385120," Extra goals."
3385120,3386260," From log."
3386260,3387520," R typeset."
3387520,3389020," Task compile."
3389020,3389520," C."
3389520,3390780," Task database."
3390780,3392880," And so on and so forth."
3392940,3394740," So, it's not particularly helpful for me here."
3394740,3396360," Config."
3396360,3397800," So, people say config."
3397800,3399680," Oof."
3399680,3401380," That's a cool one."
3401380,3404060," So, maybe that's what we want to do, actually."
3404060,3406200," So, let's take a look at the config."
3406200,3409240," Maybe even just help the config."
3410180,3411760," So, maybe that's what we're interested in."
3411760,3413520," All right."
3413520,3414480," So, here's the config."
3414480,3415840," There's a bunch of things."
3415840,3416540," Git key."
3416540,3418100," Nice one."
3418100,3422380," Okay."
3422380,3423720," That's very cool."
3423720,3427720," Maybe one of the things we have to do is just, you know, deer."
3429000,3429500," All right."
3429500,3431320," So, let's fucking go."
3431320,3436420," And let's fucking go."
3436420,3439400," Not that much."
3439400,3439760," Right."
3439760,3443200," So, I suppose you kind of need to know all of the config keys and whatnot."
3443200,3444780," Right."
3444780,3446220," So, you kind of have to know them."
3446220,3447540," But anyway."
3447540,3451440," So, let's actually maybe go into the PyPy source code."
3451440,3452000," Right."
3452000,3453340," So, there is a goal."
3453340,3455320," And we have a target."
3455320,3456760," And so on and so forth."
3456760,3457060," Right."
3457060,3458400," So, here is the config."
3459000,3459920," Uh-huh."
3459920,3460400," Uh-huh."
3460400,3462800," So, driver executable."
3462800,3463720," Uh-huh."
3463720,3466780," I would just space all working modules."
3466780,3468860," And that's a pretty big one."
3468860,3470460," That's a pretty big one."
3470460,3475500," So, somebody said about RFFI and whatnot."
3475500,3479300," I kind of vaguely remember somebody was talking about RFFI."
3479300,3483300," So, RFFI is basically FFI of the RPython."
3483300,3484200," Right."
3484200,3484640," Isn't it?"
3484640,3488760," So, foreign function interface for RPython."
3488880,3489020," Okay."
3489020,3489820," So, that's very interesting."
3489820,3496760," So, this document describes an FFI for RPython language concentrating on low-level backends like C."
3496760,3502120," It describes how to declare and call low-level C functions from RPython level."
3502120,3504340," Declaring low-level external functions."
3504340,3506840," Declaring external C functions in RPython is easy."
3506940,3519020," But one needs to remember that low-level functions eat low-level types like LL type signed or LL type array and memory management must be done by hand."
3519020,3527400," To declare a function, we write, okay, so, from RPython, Rtyper, LL type system, import RFFI."
3527400,3530400," So, and then, okay."
3530400,3534840," So, external function, LL external name, args, and the result."
3535740,3536620," So, okay."
3536620,3537820," So, okay."
3537820,3539880," External compilation in 4."
3539880,3545500," So, name a C-level name of a function."
3545500,3547680," How it would be rendered."
3547680,3551120," How it will be rendered."
3551120,3556580," How, like, low-level types of the arguments and result low-level types of the result."
3557080,3564120," You can pass an individual information about C-level indices, libraries, and source by passing in the compilation in 4."
3564120,3569980," Ah, so, compilation in 4 includes libraries and stuff like that."
3569980,3575140," C-builds more in 4 on external compilation in 4."
3575140,3576080," C-build."
3576080,3577200," Huh."
3577200,3578140," Hmm."
3578140,3579480," It's a specific example."
3579480,3581060," It's actually kind of cool."
3581060,3584480," So, translator tool C-build."
3585960,3587840," External compilation of..."
3587840,3589480," Oh, it's just a description of this."
3589480,3590000," Okay."
3590000,3591500," So, that's understandable."
3591500,3593400," From linker and stuff like that."
3593400,3595820," So, registering function as external."
3595820,3599360," Once we provide low-level implementation of an external function,"
3599360,3605700," it would be nice to wrap call in some library function like OS open with a call."
3605700,3613100," So, when we do external function, do we mean that this function will be coming from C or something?"
3614840,3619960," So, I'm not actually sure what exactly that means."
3619960,3625440," It would be better to have some examples on how to do that."
3625440,3629540," So, the ext function, some external function."
3629540,3631660," Dang."
3635620,3637000," So, C-build."
3637000,3638920," So, this is not that."
3638920,3647940," So, let's go ahead and maybe just like import all of that stuff and see how it reacts to these things."
3647940,3650380," So, here is the main."
3650380,3654080," Here is the main or Python or FFI."
3654080,3659500," And here we are just doing an external function like that."
3659540,3662560," So, I should have actually probably just copy-pasted this thing."
3662560,3664480," So, yeah."
3664480,3672680," So, in for, external function, external compilation in for, and so on and so forth."
3672680,3675980," It's not particularly like a useful example."
3675980,3677240," It's just, it's too big."
3677240,3677860," Right."
3677960,3681240," So, do I put some, like, can I just say, okay, init window."
3681240,3683440," Can I put init window in here?"
3683440,3685220," I probably could."
3685220,3685840," Right."
3685840,3689420," So, and what are the includes?"
3689420,3691200," Also, good question."
3694200,3701180," And then, what I do with external function."
3701180,3705820," Oh, what's funny is that I can try to maybe call that external function."
3705820,3706680," Okay."
3706680,3708800," So, what if I say this is init window."
3708800,3709500," Right."
3709500,3710560," So, this is init window."
3710560,3715340," And then, I simply call it in here."
3715340,3715680," Right."
3715680,3716620," So, init window."
3716620,3718880," Like so."
3718880,3721840," Yeah."
3721840,3722880," That's a good question."
3723480,3726560," How is it going to, since I call this function."
3726560,3730860," This is where this metaprogramming chat comes into play."
3730860,3734080," This is where this metaprogramming chat comes into play."
3734080,3738620," Because you call this function, but it's not RPython function."
3738620,3747460," So, this will execute at metaprogramming level, creating you the necessary RPython function."
3747460,3748480," You remember that example?"
3748480,3753380," You remember that example where you just had, like, a generator of the functions and stuff like that?"
3753380,3756880," This is how this mechanism actually comes into play."
3756880,3757720," Holy fuck."
3757720,3758940," This is so goddamn cool."
3761340,3765080," I think I'm starting to understand this entire, like, philosophy and whatnot."
3765080,3766660," Holy fuck."
3769700,3773400," So, you have page declaring external function, really?"
3773400,3773940," Declaim."
3773940,3774460," Oh, yeah."
3774460,3775660," Thank you so much."
3775660,3780220," But I think I already looked into that because, yeah, this is literally what I'm looking at."
3780220,3780560," Chat."
3780560,3782800," Stop debating me."
3782800,3783440," Stop."
3783440,3786360," Just a second."
3786360,3787420," I need to drink more tea."
3787420,3793200," Chat is debating me again."
3794540,3794960," Anyways."
3794960,3798340," So, how am I going to be doing all of that?"
3798340,3801800," I think I should just let it do the thing."
3801800,3802860," Right?"
3803080,3805500," And see how exactly it's going to shed itself."
3805500,3808320," So, that's the best approach to actually explore anything."
3808320,3809720," Just do the things."
3809720,3811140," Args is not defined."
3811140,3811760," Okay."
3811760,3813200," So, you know what?"
3813200,3816580," I want to do something like name equal to init window."
3816580,3817980," Args is empty."
3817980,3821980," And I don't know if result has to be a list or something."
3821980,3823560," But I'm going to just make it a list."
3824320,3824760," Okay."
3824760,3827280," So, assertion instance low level type."
3827280,3828260," So, what did you want?"
3828260,3830060," All right."
3830060,3831640," So, it doesn't really like..."
3831640,3831840," Yeah."
3831840,3834880," I have to specify these things somehow."
3834880,3838780," So, you know what?"
3838780,3839620," You know what?"
3839620,3840560," You know what?"
3840560,3847800," I want to maybe grab for a level extern."
3847800,3850700," Does anybody even fucking use a..."
3850700,3851120," Holy shit."
3851120,3851380," Okay."
3851380,3852380," This is how I use it."
3852380,3852740," Okay."
3853340,3855400," So, this is literally how I use it."
3855400,3857200," So, a level external."
3857200,3858160," This is the function."
3858160,3860460," This is the arguments you accept in here."
3860460,3861760," And this is what you return."
3861760,3867480," But then, do you have something like rffi void?"
3867480,3869860," I would expect that you..."
3869860,3871520," This is such a cool documentation."
3871520,3873140," Improve their Python."
3873140,3874760," All right."
3874760,3878460," So, let me just try to do that."
3878460,3880880," So, result has to be..."
3880880,3882360," I'm going to just literally do void."
3882360,3884820," I'm going to try to assume that this is what..."
3884820,3885560," How we do that."
3885560,3887120," No."
3887120,3888360," There is no void."
3888360,3892420," How can I see what kind of shit I have in there, brother?"
3892420,3894780," Can I just do print?"
3894780,3897100," Yeah."
3897100,3902540," I can do help rffi and then exit out of that."
3902540,3904720," Can I do something like that?"
3904720,3905240," Look at that."
3905240,3905720," Look at that."
3906040,3907520," So, do you have double?"
3907520,3908600," All right."
3908600,3909500," Do you have..."
3909500,3911540," Why don't you have void mind, friends?"
3911540,3913380," Where is the void?"
3913380,3916800," What if I just don't..."
3916800,3917500," Maybe it's just..."
3917500,3919500," It's a void..."
3919500,3920500," Okay."
3920500,3923900," So, there is void star."
3923900,3925800," But it's just a void p."
3925800,3927120," And void pp."
3932000,3933020," Void pp."
3933020,3934180," Oh, funny."
3934180,3935060," Funny."
3935060,3937700," Funny double letter."
3937700,3938540," Oh, pp."
3938540,3942560," Maybe it's just none."
3942560,3946640," Maybe it's just none."
3946640,3948380," All right."
3948380,3949900," Okay."
3949900,3952040," And yeah, it has to be like that, bro."
3952040,3953720," It really has to be like that."
3953720,3956260," So, it is bizarre."
3956260,3958880," So, void."
3958880,3964320," Sign int array."
3964320,3969060," And I assume that void star is just like..."
3969060,3970820," It's void p, essentially."
3970820,3974700," How can I say nothing?"
3974700,3977460," Short pp."
3977460,3979860," I wonder if there is a short pp."
3979860,3980660," No."
3980660,3981560," There's no."
3981560,3982660," There's short p."
3983180,3985120," But there is no short pp."
3985120,3986340," Null?"
3986340,3987200," Null?"
3987200,3988620," How is that a..."
3988620,3989100," People."
3989100,3990420," Null is not a type."
3990420,3993100," There is no such thing as null as well."
3993100,3994600," Stop gp."
3994600,3994860," Okay."
3994860,3995720," So, there is null."
3995720,3997000," Which is none, by the way."
3997000,4000540," Like, null is not a type."
4000540,4004560," So, and void star is not a valid token in Python."
4004560,4006700," What the fuck are you talking about, chat?"
4006700,4007360," Stop."
4007360,4011620," Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?"
4011900,4014560," Like, this doesn't make any fucking sense."
4014560,4014980," Right."
4014980,4016080," Stop saying nonsense."
4016080,4017420," Null is not a type."
4017420,4019720," Null is not a type."
4019720,4020340," Null is..."
4020340,4021060," It's a value."
4021060,4023180," Guys, do you know C?"
4023180,4029060," If it is going to work, I will ask this question to PyPy developers."
4029620,4036280," If this is how you're supposed to do that, the only question to PyPy developers I have is, do you know C?"
4036280,4039020," Right."
4039020,4040580," It's just like, no."
4040580,4041980," Null is not a type."
4041980,4044120," Guys, how many times I have to repeat that?"
4044120,4044880," It's a value."
4044880,4046440," It's not a type."
4046440,4047280," It's a value."
4048400,4048840," Right."
4048840,4050480," So, oh, fuck."
4050480,4050980," Shit."
4050980,4053220," Where is my..."
4053220,4054340," I think I need to reset."
4054340,4055400," All right."
4055400,4058740," Talk fucking told you."
4058740,4060940," Fucking told you."
4060940,4062260," Fucking told you."
4062260,4063300," Fucking told you."
4063300,4064480," Fucking told you."
4064480,4065400," Stop."
4065400,4065780," Chat."
4065780,4066540," Stop."
4066540,4067640," Get some help."
4067940,4068120," Okay."
4068120,4070060," So, let's actually try to do void P."
4070060,4071720," Right."
4071720,4074040," And it kind of works, but it's incorrect."
4074040,4074560," Right."
4074560,4077300," So, because this function doesn't return void P."
4077300,4080960," So, it's going to compile, but again, it's not the correct."
4080960,4081440," Right."
4081440,4084280," So, there should be something like a void or whatnot."
4084280,4086140," That doesn't make any sense to me."
4086140,4086900," That's so bizarre."
4086900,4087520," Honestly."
4087520,4090180," Okay."
4090180,4091100," So, it's doing things."
4091100,4092560," And what else?"
4092560,4092980," What else?"
4092980,4093280," What else?"
4093280,4095020," And it shits with..."
4095020,4095320," Yeah."
4095320,4096260," That's understandable."
4097340,4098600," That is actually an assemble."
4098600,4098880," Okay."
4098880,4099420," So, let's go."
4099420,4101600," Let's go to Ray San."
4101600,4102820," By the way."
4102820,4103920," By the way."
4103920,4109580," Ray San said that he is going to release a new version of Ray Leap soon."
4109580,4111780," Allo type void."
4111780,4115040," Where can I have allo type, by the way?"
4115040,4119640," So, allo external."
4119640,4121300," Okay."
4121300,4122760," So, let's give it a try."
4122760,4124000," All right."
4124000,4126140," So, somebody is saying interesting things."
4126740,4130520," So, there should be allo type."
4130520,4130880," Okay."
4130880,4133800," Allo type."
4133800,4135480," Uh-huh."
4135480,4137720," Okay."
4137720,4142380," So, that means we have to do something like allo type."
4142380,4142820," Right."
4142820,4143500," Is that what you mean?"
4143500,4144960," Okay."
4144960,4148800," Why is it so weird, bruv?"
4150360,4163900," So, why did they nest specifically that into another module?"
4163900,4164400," Okay."
4164400,4164820," Thank you."
4164820,4165400," Thank you so much."
4165400,4167640," That's kind of weird."
4167640,4177960," So, why did they nest specifically that into another module?"
4177960,4179920," It's just like they didn't do that for double."
4179920,4181580," They didn't do that for other things."
4181580,4183680," But they did that specifically for the void."
4183680,4185360," Does it make any sense to me?"
4185440,4185660," Anyway."
4185660,4188780," So, they're trying to link with the init window."
4188780,4189380," Right."
4189380,4191720," But they can't do that because there's no such thing."
4191720,4194280," So, let's go ahead and just download, really."
4194280,4201300," Let's download low-level types."
4201960,4203660," Why are you saying that in the chat?"
4203660,4205160," I know what allo types means."
4205160,4206160," This is not what I'm asking."
4206160,4208480," Do you hear what I'm saying?"
4208480,4209660," Troll in the chat."
4209660,4210720," Troll in the chat."
4210720,4212040," Do you hear what I'm saying?"
4212040,4213520," Or are you just trying to annoy me?"
4213520,4214440," Okay."
4214440,4219520," So, probably don't hear what I'm saying."
4219520,4225080," That will get muted."
4225080,4226060," Yes."
4226060,4226320," Okay."
4226320,4226640," Cool."
4226640,4230760," I'm really glad to hear that."
4231180,4233920," So, let's actually try to unpack this entire thing."
4233920,4236340," I'm really glad that you just, you know,"
4236340,4238240," implicitly agreed that you were troll."
4238240,4242080," Okay."
4242080,4243160," Fair enough."
4243160,4254120," So, I suppose the thing we need to do is in here, right?"
4254120,4258860," So, okay."
4259700,4262640," This is my hypothesis, how you have to do this kind of stuff."
4262640,4264520," This is my hypothesis."
4264520,4267600," I'm not sure why the fuck you need includes, though."
4267600,4270880," Because it, okay."
4270880,4272140," So, that's, that's rather interesting."
4272140,4274160," So, because it generates C code."
4275160,4283860," So, that means it can include additional things for additional type checking at C."
4283860,4290940," So, if we don't include anything in here, if we don't include anything in here, it will probably throw a warning."
4290940,4296280," I don't know anything about that in it, blah, blah, blah thing you just, like, told me or something."
4296280,4298440," I think that's how it's going to go."
4298440,4300100," What do you think?"
4300100,4301060," What do you think?"
4301060,4302100," I think that's how it's going to go."
4302100,4303860," Anyway, let's actually start the rainbow."
4303860,4306120," Let's fucking go."
4306120,4308400," Let's fucking go."
4308860,4331120," I was fucking right."
4331120,4333940," I was fucking right."
4333940,4342100," So, yeah, you need that to get, I fucking predicted that exact fucking error message."
4342100,4349080," So, to fix that exact error message, you have to specify what you want to fucking include, mate."
4349080,4352440," You want to include raylib.h."
4354680,4356600," Right, get predicted, noob."
4356600,4357420," Okay."
4357420,4359660," Chat, stop being so hateful."
4359660,4360340," Come on, come on."
4360340,4361960," All right."
4361960,4363820," So, let's actually put this shit in here."
4363820,4368480," And this is include and raylib.h."
4368480,4369880," All right."
4369880,4370920," So, let's go."
4370920,4373100," So, it's going to fix that error."
4373100,4375100," It's going to fix that error."
4375100,4379380," Maybe it's going to fail with the discrepancy of types in here."
4379380,4379700," Right."
4379700,4381740," So, because the types here are slightly different."
4381740,4383940," All right."
4384060,4386380," Types are slightly different, but anyway."
4386380,4388460," Okay."
4388460,4389820," So, it's doing things."
4389820,4392420," Okay."
4392420,4393720," So, what does it say?"
4393720,4395880," Fuck me."
4395880,4398120," Fuck me, bro."
4398120,4401340," So, what does it say?"
4401340,4403360," No such file or directory."
4403360,4405260," Are you out of your mind?"
4405260,4410680," Is that because of this shit that you're not supposed to have an includes?"
4411780,4415380," Or am I missing something?"
4415380,4418000," Wrong directory."
4418000,4419960," This is not a wrong directory."
4419960,4422480," Dude, dude, dude."
4422480,4423260," Stop."
4423260,4425080," Stop doing this kind of shit."
4430180,4431900," And the minus I flag."
4431900,4432200," Yeah."
4432200,4434060," So, we need some sort of minus I flag."
4434060,4438320," But the question is, how do I even do that?"
4438320,4439400," So, maybe..."
4439400,4441280," Yeah."
4441280,4442540," So, the angle of brackets."
4442540,4446320," Like, I'm not sure if this is even a valid, like, C code."
4447060,4449440," I'm not sure if this is a valid C code."
4449440,4450440," Right."
4450440,4451980," So, let me try to do that."
4451980,4455520," Oh, my God."
4455520,4457900," Just copy-paste this thing already."
4457900,4460680," Okay."
4460680,4461680," So, if I..."
4461680,4463920," Look, the Emacs actually highlights it fine."
4463920,4465800," But, I mean, this is my own highlight mode."
4466140,4467720," So, it doesn't really mean anything."
4467720,4473120," So, and if I try to do cco main main.c."
4473120,4474540," Right."
4474540,4475020," Yeah."
4475020,4476620," So, now such file directory."
4476620,4479440," But, what if I put this thing?"
4479440,4480060," Okay."
4480060,4482440," It's also now such file or directory."
4482440,4483660," If I do this."
4483660,4483980," Yeah."
4484540,4486940," So, this is annoying, bro."
4486940,4487920," What the fuck?"
4487920,4492340," So, you can only include the things that are, like..."
4492340,4495140," Yeah."
4495140,4497860," You have to specify a path."
4497860,4498680," Like, what the fuck?"
4498680,4502580," But, the question is, how can I specify the path?"
4502580,4505340," Can I..."
4505340,4506800," I don't fucking know."
4506800,4511160," So, it has to be help external compilation for..."
4511160,4511320," Right."
4511320,4512540," So, exit 6 to 9."
4512540,4513400," Full path."
4513500,4514520," Like, come on, bro."
4514520,4516120," Come on."
4516120,4517680," This is, like..."
4517680,4519180," I don't want to do that."
4519180,4522700," So, is there something like pwd in Python?"
4522700,4524680," P-W-D..."
4524680,4526400," All right."
4526400,4527660," Bro, no."
4527660,4528880," I don't want to fucking do that."
4528880,4529400," That's stupid."
4529400,4532120," But, we can try to do that."
4532120,4532360," Okay."
4532360,4536480," Python absolute path."
4536480,4538060," How do you do Python absolute path?"
4538060,4540300," It's stupid, but I feel like I have to do that."
4540300,4542260," So, yeah."
4542460,4543960," So, let's import OS."
4543960,4546000," OS."
4546000,4548540," All right."
4548540,4550420," So, this is import OS."
4550420,4552540," And OS path, apps path."
4552540,4554260," Okay."
4554260,4557560," OS path, apps path."
4557560,4561360," So, if I try to do this kind of shit."
4561360,4563240," And..."
4563240,4564500," All right."
4564500,4565580," So, let's go."
4568140,4568640," OS."
4568640,4569080," OS."
4569080,4573600," So, maybe it will work this time."
4573600,4575360," It's kind of interesting."
4575360,4580180," We'll probably have to do the same shit with library, but not necessarily, actually."
4580180,4582380," Not necessarily."
4583100,4585640," So, it will complain about the lack of..."
4585640,4587100," Okay."
4587100,4587740," It's doing things."
4587740,4588540," Yeah."
4588540,4589580," This is what I'm talking about."
4589580,4590400," Holy shit."
4590400,4590820," Look at that."
4590820,4593640," So, too few are..."
4593640,4596120," Chef's kiss."
4596120,4597400," Chef's kiss."
4597400,4597700," Okay."
4597700,4598560," So, that's pretty cool."
4598760,4604540," What we have to do here is we have to pass some, you know, width and height and width and height."
4604540,4612600," So, let me find the usage for this thing yet again."
4613920,4614640," So, yeah."
4614640,4618320," You can just do int and stuff like that."
4618320,4623380," So, it's more like rffi int."
4623380,4625060," rffi int."
4625060,4626200," There we go."
4626200,4630300," And the question is, can I have a char?"
4630300,4634840," Does it have like a char pointers and stuff?"
4634840,4638320," So, you have a char buffer and size."
4638320,4639880," What about strings?"
4642020,4642900," That's annoying."
4642900,4645520," So, there's out pointer."
4645520,4647360," So, there's a thing."
4647360,4647640," Okay."
4647640,4648880," So, this one is interesting."
4648880,4652220," Extensible type for allow external."
4652220,4652980," C, rrape."
4652980,4653360," Okay."
4653360,4654380," So, this one is cool."
4654380,4656580," So, maybe this is what we can use."
4656580,4660700," So, improve rpython."
4660700,4662160," Yeah."
4662160,4663380," String."
4663380,4665820," rpython string."
4665820,4667680," So, is that what it is?"
4667680,4669840," Like a char buffer array set."
4669840,4671100," What the fuck is that then?"
4672020,4682180," Well, I mean, this is not the problem I solve."
4682180,4683420," How do I pass a string?"
4683420,4684220," I don't care."
4684220,4686740," We already build everything, people."
4686740,4689720," Why are you constantly pinging me with irrelevant problems?"
4689720,4691200," We already solved that, didn't we?"
4691200,4692980," How do I pass a string?"
4692980,4694780," Chat, you are too slow."
4695580,4696940," You can't keep up."
4696940,4700800," So, if you want to be on a dozing string, you have to keep up."
4700800,4702600," We're solving problem very quickly."
4702600,4702900," Okay."
4702900,4704180," Solve problem, next problem."
4704180,4705160," Solve problem, next problem."
4705160,4706060," Solve problem, next problem."
4706060,4706820," Keep up."
4706820,4707580," Keep up."
4707580,4708120," Keep up."
4708120,4709520," We already passed that."
4709520,4711400," We already passed the include folders."
4711400,4711940," That's it."
4711940,4713740," How do we use a string?"
4717240,4718060," I'm joking."
4718060,4719700," Anyways."
4719700,4721480," So, yeah."
4721480,4721900," Keep up."
4721900,4723860," How do we do that?"
4723860,4725660," So, the question is, how do we do the strings?"
4728140,4729740," That's a good question, mine."
4729740,4741760," So, no worries."
4741760,4742860," Just slow internet here."
4742860,4743400," Okay."
4743400,4746880," Thank you so much, Ledinets."
4746880,4748300," Thank you so much for this."
4748300,4748900," Prime with the message."
4748900,4749400," No worries."
4749400,4750360," Just a slow internet."
4750360,4751260," Thank you."
4751260,4752160," I understand that."
4752160,4752740," I understand."
4752740,4754240," Charp."
4754240,4755620," You think charp?"
4755620,4757140," I'm not sure about charp, though."
4757140,4758820," Oh, there is such thing as charp."
4758820,4761180," There is a c charp."
4761180,4765180," One of the things we probably want to take a look at, actually."
4765180,4775000," One of the things we want to take a look at is, yeah, help rffi exit 69."
4775000,4777540," Yes, I know I put a semicolon."
4777540,4780460," I'm going to put another one and another one and another one."
4780460,4781380," All right."
4781380,4782040," Let's go."
4782040,4784400," So, let me see."
4784400,4784660," Oh."
4787140,4788600," Really?"
4788600,4791440," You tell me this is an invalid syntax."
4791440,4792920," Fuck."
4792920,4793280," Okay."
4793280,4795200," I can't troll chat."
4795200,4798000," I can't fucking troll chat."
4798000,4799120," I can't fucking damn it."
4799120,4799320," Anyway."
4799320,4800520," Charpy."
4800520,4802080," Charpy, charpy."
4802080,4803680," Const c charpy."
4803680,4805560," Why is it c charpy?"
4806280,4809940," So, array of character, no length, true."
4809940,4811660," Okay."
4811660,4813880," C charpy."
4813880,4816400," I think that's what we need, actually."
4816400,4817520," C charpy."
4817520,4818380," All right."
4820080,4822020," So, that's what we have to put in here."
4822020,4826100," R appify c charpy."
4826100,4828500," And now, the real question."
4828500,4831360," Can I just do something like that?"
4831360,4835300," Hello from rpython."
4837820,4840260," So, that's a good question."
4840260,4840980," Okay."
4840980,4841720," Let's fucking go."
4841720,4843180," Cheers, chat."
4843180,4843820," Cheers."
4843820,4849020," Oh, fuck."
4849020,4849700," Okay."
4849700,4850080," I'm sorry."
4850080,4851400," Sorry."
4851400,4853800," Let's go."
4853800,4857280," C or const?"
4857280,4858680," Oh, it could be const, actually."
4858680,4858960," Yeah."
4859200,4859480," Okay."
4859480,4861060," I see what it's all about."
4861060,4865200," I see what it is all about."
4865200,4867340," I see what it is all about."
4867340,4876340," Okay."
4876340,4884020," Okay."
4884020,4887140," So, let's go into that C build by thingy."
4887140,4888060," So, thank you so much."
4889200,4890780," All right."
4890780,4892060," So, just a second."
4892060,4894440," So, thank you so much, CodeCat69."
4894440,4898320," In the C build.py, there's more option explained, like include deers."
4898320,4898920," Maybe you want."
4898920,4899100," Yeah."
4899100,4899920," Maybe I want that."
4899920,4903280," So, you see, sometimes we go back into the old problems, right?"
4903280,4906480," So, it's totally fine."
4906480,4906740," Okay."
4906740,4908160," Can we find this thing?"
4908160,4912560," So, it's a type F name C build.py."
4912560,4913900," So, okay."
4913900,4914960," So, it's here."
4914960,4915900," Let's go there."
4915900,4917560," All right."
4917560,4919140," So, include deers."
4919140,4921220," Okay."
4921220,4922440," Is there any examples?"
4922440,4923640," Okay."
4923640,4925240," There's literally include deers."
4925240,4926200," Okay."
4926200,4927420," That's funny."
4927420,4929900," So, this is attributes, right?"
4931060,4932960," So, if I go..."
4932960,4933180," Thank you."
4933180,4934380," Thank you so much, CodeCat69."
4934380,4939580," So, oh, chatter."
4939580,4940840," Oh, my God."
4940840,4944240," They were from the..."
4944240,4946400," It's me who can't keep up."
4946400,4948300," Holy shit."
4948300,4951600," There were several steps ahead of me."
4952440,4952600," What?"
4952600,4956460," Okay."
4956460,4958020," Anyways."
4958020,4963040," It's actually funny."
4963040,4965160," So, we have include deers, right?"
4965160,4967220," So, this is basically what we can do, right?"
4967220,4968300," So, here is include deers."
4968440,4970560," And that means, short, short, short."
4970560,4973540," That means we can do something like this."
4973540,4978720," And then, I can just do this kind of stuff."
4978720,4980420," Boom."
4980420,4983100," Boom, boom, boom."
4983100,4985280," I want you to bring my room."
4985280,4987500," Let's bend and try together."
4987500,4989640," Together, bring my room."
4991080,4994160," I wonder if I can just do something like this."
4994160,4996360," So, there's also library deers."
4996360,5000700," So, that means I can put stuff like that."
5000700,5002700," And this is de-library-deer."
5002700,5004800," De-library-deer."
5004800,5008900," And, right."
5008900,5012080," So, yeah."
5012080,5013960," It's probably not going to work."
5013960,5016260," But I just want to try."
5016260,5017820," Because it's using a different syntax."
5017820,5020220," You can't just allow this kind of thing."
5020220,5022140," I probably have to do that without the extension."
5022140,5023720," But that also probably means that"
5023720,5027640," it will use the dynamic one."
5027640,5029260," Dynamic library, not the static one."
5029260,5030640," All right."
5030640,5030940," Let's go."
5030940,5031920," So, invalid syntax."
5031920,5032320," Fuck."
5032320,5034500," I forgot some commas."
5034500,5036320," I forgot some commas."
5036320,5041780," All right."
5041780,5047000," All right."
5047000,5048160," It's doing its rainbow thing."
5049360,5051320," It's specializing the blocks."
5051320,5053500," Not generalizing them."
5053500,5055020," Just specializing."
5055020,5058280," So, it's doing makefile."
5058280,5058680," Okay."
5058680,5061320," And, obviously, it couldn't do that."
5061320,5063580," So, one of the things we can do."
5063580,5064000," Right."
5064000,5066480," So, because it just, like, puts it as is."
5066480,5069420," So, if you want to make it work with GCC,"
5069420,5072700," you have to actually put a colon between these two else."
5072700,5073420," Right."
5073480,5075260," And, in that case, it will use specific library."
5075260,5076820," One of the things we can do."
5076820,5080320," We can just say, you know, ray leap."
5080320,5084080," And it will link, actually, with whatever it will find."
5084080,5086480," And, usually, it means the dynamic one."
5086480,5086860," Right."
5086860,5088140," Which is not what we want."
5088140,5090720," Which is actually not what we want."
5091280,5092740," Oh, that's, okay."
5092740,5093980," So, that's actually really funny."
5093980,5096320," So, that means we can hack it like that?"
5096320,5102200," Did the creators of our Python anticipate that we're going to be using it like that?"
5102200,5106260," I think we get, we, I think they didn't expect that we're going to be using it like that."
5107400,5108800," We're hacking the system."
5108800,5110700," We're hacking the system."
5110700,5111300," Holy shit."
5111300,5112460," Okay."
5112460,5114720," Okay, okay, okay, okay."
5114720,5118240," And, uh..."
5118240,5121100," Fuck you!"
5121100,5125160," That is actually an easy problem."
5125160,5127620," Because it's just a lack of the math library."
5127620,5129160," So, just put M in here."
5129160,5130700," Just put M."
5137400,5140860," Lack of the math, yeah."
5140860,5143900," Specializing the blocks."
5143900,5145440," Specializing the blocks."
5145440,5157020," Okay."
5157020,5159580," So, let's take a look."
5159580,5161140," And, uh, your mom."
5165860,5168860," The legendary Rayleigh blog."
5168860,5171780," How about fucking that?"
5171780,5173540," Holy shit."
5173540,5175540," Uh, all right."
5175540,5178120," So, now we can continue doing this kind of stuff, right?"
5178120,5181440," So, uh, we can add more different functions, right?"
5181440,5185320," So, for example, maybe, uh, close the window and stuff like that."
5185320,5187180," Uh, maybe we can just, like, do it on this."
5187180,5187880," Okay."
5187880,5190440," So, um, hmm."
5190440,5195080," Um, so, we can do, like, window should close."
5195380,5197480," Right, so we can check that window should close."
5197480,5200240," Window should, uh, close."
5200240,5202020," Right, so here's the window should close."
5202020,5204460," Then, uh, we do that."
5204460,5207460," But this thing should probably return a Boolean."
5207460,5208120," But I don't remember."
5208120,5211760," Does it return Boolean or does it return, uh, integer?"
5211760,5213700," Uh, so let me see."
5213700,5215180," Window should..."
5215180,5216220," It does return Boolean."
5216220,5218300," Uh, I'm not sure."
5218300,5219520," Does it just have Boo?"
5219520,5221340," I hope it does."
5221400,5223400," But it also will take some time to build."
5223400,5226800," So, the thing that kills me with RPython is the compilation time."
5226800,5228800," Freaking 20 seconds for Hello World."
5228800,5229660," What the fuck is this?"
5229660,5233360," Maybe this is because I'm using..."
5233360,5236240," Yeah, maybe this is because I'm using, like, a pipe..."
5236240,5237680," I don't even know what was that."
5237680,5241080," Uh, so Boolean isn't real type, right?"
5241080,5242520," Eh, I don't know."
5242660,5245760," It doesn't really mean that our FFI is not going to have it, though."
5245760,5246420," Right."
5246420,5249120," So, it's just like, I don't know."
5249120,5250620," I'll give it a try."
5250620,5253760," So, Boolean doesn't have Boolean."
5253760,5259000," So, it might be in the LL types, right?"
5259000,5260080," So, LL type."
5260080,5262280," Uh-huh."
5262280,5263600," So, Boolean."
5263600,5264920," Boolean."
5264920,5267940," Okay, it does have Boo, though."
5267940,5268520," Right."
5268520,5270980," Hmm, does it have Boolean?"
5270980,5272800," So, along with void."
5272800,5274940," So, let's give it a try."
5274940,5277760," So, um..."
5277760,5281860," Well, I'll type Boo."
5281860,5285900," Do includes std Boo."
5285900,5287640," Maybe we'll have to do std Boo."
5287640,5289780," Right, so let's actually see."
5289780,5290540," Let's actually try."
5290540,5292960," Okay, no attribute Boo."
5292960,5293860," Fuck."
5293860,5300260," We can just return integer, can't we?"
5300260,5300700," Boo?"
5300700,5301460," Do you think it's Boo?"
5301460,5304160," Chat, stop guessing."
5304160,5305940," Oh, it was actually true."
5305940,5306460," Okay."
5306460,5307680," So, you were not guessing."
5307680,5315080," Man, the compilation times is just like..."
5315080,5319300," Uh, while not window should close."
5319300,5323440," Right, so we probably have to do begin drawing and end drawing."
5323440,5328780," Well, begin drawing and end drawing are kind of easy."
5328780,5329980," Uh, right?"
5329980,5332340," So, because they don't really have any parameters."
5332340,5335720," Begin drawing, end drawing."
5335860,5337260," So, the result is void."
5337260,5338260," So, the result is void."
5338260,5341760," And here, it's going to be just end."
5341760,5345480," Right, so that's what we're doing here."
5345480,5346900," Let's try to recompile one more time."
5348240,5351900," Uh, and this one should be relatively easy and straightforward."
5351900,5355400," Parentheses for window show."
5355400,5356220," Yeah, you're right."
5356220,5357440," You're actually right."
5357440,5358720," Just a second."
5358720,5361640," Uh-huh."
5366160,5366920," Pascal, yeah."
5366920,5367820," We're programming in Pascal."
5367820,5371980," So, would they have caught that?"
5371980,5372580," I don't know."
5372580,5374000," Maybe they would."
5374000,5380260," I don't really know how much analysis it does."
5380260,5383060," Okay."
5383060,5386180," Got the window."
5386180,5388960," And it says, hello from our pipeline."
5388960,5394680," Uh, Raylib speedrun has been passed."
5394960,5397020," It passed the Raylib test."
5397020,5398300," How about that?"
5398300,5403800," So, and on top of that, it's an actually, you know, native executable."
5403800,5404640," Right, so look at that."
5404640,5406440," It's an actual native executable."
5406440,5409100," But all of that, like this program, is in Python."
5409100,5411480," So, and it's not just Python."
5411480,5413300," It's RPython specifically."
5413300,5416020," It's RPython specifically."
5416020,5420140," You know what's interesting, actually, about this entire thing?"
5421560,5430320," Is it runnable with, I don't know, with regular Python, theoretically, maybe?"
5431420,5433840," So, what if I just, like, use it?"
5433840,5435720," So, this is a Python 2 specifically."
5435720,5438760," I can try to do the following thing."
5438760,5439580," Pypy2."
5439580,5442140," Right, so then bin pypy."
5442140,5444280," Right, so pypy."
5444280,5446060," Can I import main?"
5446760,5451380," I manage to import main, and then, can I just do entry point?"
5451380,5455600," So, it accepts argv, so I'm going to just put this kind of thing."
5455600,5460600," All right, so, function window not found in any libraries."
5460600,5462320," Yeah, you can't just run it."
5462920,5475040," So, the funny thing, yeah, the funny thing is, if your program does not interface with C, you can potentially interpret it, and then also compile it to something native."
5475040,5476960," Yeah, RFFI wouldn't exist."
5476960,5482340," Yeah, so, this specific program we probably can't use from regular Python."
5482340,5488260," But, if it was not depending on Rayleap, we could actually do that."
5488260,5501500," Right, so, some of the things you can do here is essentially just test with interpret Python, and then, once you're, you know, sure that there's no bugs or anything, you can compile it to C and then to native things."
5501500,5504880," There's a Python-specific C interfaces, aren't there?"
5504880,5506940," Maybe there are, but here's the thing."
5506940,5508460," We're using static library in here."
5508800,5512580," So, maybe one of the things we have to do in here is to use the dynamic one?"
5512580,5513640," I don't fucking know."
5513640,5518180," So, what if I just put Rayleap in here, like so?"
5518180,5521260," Is that something I can do?"
5521260,5526700," So, I'm going to import main, and then I just call entry point with an argument."
5526700,5530240," No fucking way!"
5530240,5531380," Holy shit!"
5531380,5537180," Based."
5537920,5539040," Ironically based."
5539040,5541420," It loaded dynamic."
5541420,5542680," What the?"
5542680,5544200," This is so fucking cool."
5544200,5549460," So, the same code can be interpreted, and then compa-"
5549460,5551260," Holy shit!"
5551260,5557160," This is so goddamn fucking cool!"
5557160,5558460," What the fuck!"
5558460,5561700," Damn!"
5561700,5565440," Like, I mean, it feels unnecessary, as I already said."
5566240,5571000," The entire R-Python setup thingy is, like, feels unnecessary."
5571000,5573700," But goddamn, isn't it cool?"
5573700,5575480," Huge respect."
5575480,5578640," So, and PyPy is a very old thing, right?"
5578640,5586320," So, like, I remember it from, I think, 10 years ago, when I only started my career of software development."
5586900,5594980," And it's coming from this old, like, tech culture, the same tech culture that created things like cello."
5595140,5597380," Right, you guys remember we were trying cello?"
5597380,5600640," Right, okay, so there's something weird in here."
5600640,5604120," Right, you guys remember cello, the library."
5604120,5608060," Like, it's the same goddamn culture that created this thing."
5608060,5611020," Right, and that's why it's so goddamn fucking cool."
5611020,5615360," And at cello, we had a stream about this entire thing, so I'm going to put it in the description."
5615420,5619140," Right, so I really like things like that."
5619140,5621420," I forgot close window, did I?"
5621420,5622280," Didn't I?"
5622280,5622600," Maybe."
5622600,5623840," Didn't call close window."
5623840,5626200," But I hope it will automatically destroy it anyway."
5626200,5628020," But yeah, anyway."
5628020,5630860," So, that's about it, I think."
5630860,5635920," Right, so, R-Python is kind of a cool idea."
5636560,5639520," So unnecessary, but that's what makes it cool."
5639520,5642620," Unnecessary, but cool."
5642620,5644940," Just like with cello, right."
5644940,5648400," The best part was the cello-defined word, yeah."
5648400,5650020," So, it was actually kind of cool."
5650020,5654960," Right, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know."
5654960,5656260," So cool."
5656260,5662320," People spend some time just to prove a point that Python is a real language,"
5662320,5664660," and you can actually implement Python in itself."
5665060,5670060," How many, like, modern JavaScript programmers can do something like that with JavaScript?"
5670060,5674180," Like, I'm sure it is possible to do something like that with JavaScript,"
5674180,5678720," but how many, like, modern JavaScript programmers will actually go to that extent to prove that?"
5678720,5680980," It's just like the culture is not there."
5680980,5682620," Right."
5682620,5684360," It is technically possible."
5684360,5685620," It's possible, right."
5685620,5689840," But it's just like we're lacking this engineering, like, you know,"
5689840,5692360," shitposting culture that is capable of doing that."
5693740,5697420," So, maybe there is something like a JS, like GSGS or whatever."
5697420,5698840," Oh."
5698840,5699680," Oh."
5699680,5701280," Oh."
5701280,5703160," Oh."
5703160,5703700," Oh."
5703700,5706980," Oh."
5708580,5713320," So, is it JavaScript interpreting JavaScript instead of trying to create an interpreter of Scratch,"
5713560,5714560," SpiderMonkey?"
5714560,5718560," SpiderMonkey is compiled into LLVM and then in script and translate to LLVM and then in script and translate to LLVM."
5718560,5726300," So, SpiderMonkey, SpiderMonkey is this Mozilla JavaScript."
5734380,5738720," I don't really know how it works, but I mean, I guess culture is still there."
5738720,5739720," Not quite."
5739720,5740000," Yeah."
5740000,5741440," Kind of bizarre."
5741440,5746440," But this thing feels just like more self-contained, if you know what I mean."
5746440,5748220," There we count."
5748220,5749380," Yeah."
5749380,5752460," So, it's pretty cool."
5752460,5756420," Passes the Rayleigh test."
5756420,5758460," Very, very cool."
5759300,5759620," All right."
5759620,5762660," I'm already still in more than two hours, actually."
5762660,5764240," So, that's my usual limit."
5764240,5765320," That's my usual limit."
5765320,5768960," And I think it's time for me to go, my new friend."
5768960,5770240," It's time for me to go."
5770240,5772400," Thanks, everyone, who's watching me right now."
5772400,5773700," I really appreciate it."
5773700,5775000," Have a good one."
5775000,5779780," And I see you all on the next recreational programming session with Ahu and Mr. Azuzian."
5779780,5780220," That's Ray."
5780220,5782080," So, I love you all."
5782080,5782700," Mwah."
5782700,5782700," Mwah."
5782700,5785020," - Yeah."
