880,8120," Looks like we are live. Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session. How about that?"
8120,13160," Let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start the stream as usual."
13160,18280," What the hell has happened? Something with my keyboard, right?"
18280,28240," So, what are we doing today? What are we doing today? Today we're doing a red circle, live on Twitch."
29300,39060," And what are we doing on Twitch.television website? Today we are doing Python string distance, right?"
39060,44140," Python string distance. I'm going to give the link to the Twitch channel where we're doing all that."
44140,50440," Right, twitch.television. And I'm going to ping everyone who's interested in being pinged."
50440,55360," Just a second. And there we go. The stream has officially started."
55360,58640," So, the Discord is extra slow today for some reason. I don't know why."
59080,63780," Maybe they deployed a new version, right? Some change from an intern."
63780,66500," But yeah, hello, hello. Welcome, welcome everyone."
66500,70480," So, today we're going to be doing a little bit of a Python coding."
70480,78640," So, today we're going to explore a little bit, a very interesting algorithm that actually computes the distance between two strings."
78640,83220," Right, so this algorithm is actually quite often used in things like Git, I think."
83220,94660," I don't know for sure if Git actually uses that algorithm, but it has this feature where if you misspell a command, right, it actually suggests you similar commands."
95220,102480," So, how does it determine whether whatever input is actually similar to these commands, right?"
102960,107660," So, how I personally would do that, I would use something called Levenstein distance."
107660,113440," Right, Levenstein distance. I'm not sure how I spell that correctly, I'm really sorry."
114560,126820," So, and this is basically the amount of actions, insertions, deletions, and substitutions you have to make to the first string to get the second one, right?"
127260,131840," So, and the amount of such actions is called Levenstein distance, right?"
131840,140520," And the bigger, or rather, the smaller that number is, the closer the strings are to each other, right?"
140520,148500," So, and having this sort of metric, it's super easy to come up with an algorithm that takes your input, like in the case of a Git,"
148920,153680," iterate through all the commands and computes their Levenstein distance and basically presents you with"
153680,161640," top 10 closest to what you try to input and then you can pick whatever you actually want to put in there, right?"
161640,170300," So, this is a very interesting algorithm. I used it in the past for my own command line tools and stuff like that, right?"
170300,177740," But the problem with, at least personally for me, with this algorithm is that I always treated it as a black box."
177940,184320," I never tried to understand this algorithm. So, what I usually did is essentially I would go to the Wikipedia article"
184320,193700," and I would just like copy this formula. I just put this formula into the code and simply use it as a black box"
193700,201080," without trying to understand. But the problem with that approach is that what if I have a different set of actions, right?"
201080,206960," What if I don't have substitutions? You know what I mean? Right? How do I modify this particular black box"
206960,211340," To have different sets of actions?"
211340,215340," And furthermore, the thing this algorithm gives me is the amount of actions, right?"
215340,219900," Only the amount, but it doesn't give me the specific actions."
219900,227400," It would be kind of cool to also have an algorithm that on top of giving me the amount of like minimal amount of actions that I have to perform,"
227400,231780," It will give me the list of actions. It will give me the list of actions. That would be kind of cool."
231780,233780," I think."
233780,241780," And once you get the algorithm that gives you the list of actions, like where you have to insert a character or remove a character."
241780,250160," What if you replace characters with the lines now, you would get an algorithm that computes a div between the files?"
250160,256160," Right. I think. I'm not sure if this is the actual algorithm that is used in like diff utilities and stuff like that."
256160,262540," But it feels like, you know, the 11th 10 distance, right?"
262540,267540," Because the patches are usually expressed in terms of like adding a line and removing a line."
267540,272540," Right. And this is basically like that, except instead of lines, we use characters, but who said we have to use characters?"
272540,278680," Right. So it's just like, I mean, it could, could be anything. It could be any sequence of objects."
278680,281720," Right. So, and that's what I want you to do today."
281720,285880," I want you to explore this algorithm a little bit closer."
285880,289560," Right. So we've got some subs."
289560,294220," Thank you so much, Cina Basil for seven months of tier one subscription."
294220,295460," Thank you. Thank you. Thank you with the message."
295460,299840," I don't know why I wasn't subbed, but hi, hi, really glad to see you."
300240,302580," Hi, hi, hi."
302580,303240," All right."
303240,308280," So let's go and create a folder where we're going to be doing all of our shenanigans."
308280,309740," Right."
309740,311860," So let's call it LevPy."
311860,312980," Right."
312980,315760," And let's create a file LevPy."
315760,317800," It didn't create a file for some reason."
317800,321000," Come on, please create a file."
321000,325200," It didn't switch to Emacs or to Python mode for some reason."
325200,328100," I don't know why, because Emacs is broken just a second."
328100,330100," I need to restart Emacs."
330100,333400," I need to restart my Emacs."
333400,336440," All righty, so let me see."
336440,339640," So LevPy, finally."
339640,343940," So what I'm doing here, I want to craft a little bit of a shebang."
343940,346660," UserBinEnvironmentPython3."
346660,351820," And what we're going to do in here, we're going to say something like hello world."
351820,357860," So we're also going to make this thing executable, so I can now run this entire thing."
357860,360900," and we have a little bit of a hello world."
360900,367400," OK, so let's try to come up with a function called Lev, right, which accepts two strings."
367400,368400," Two strings, right."
368400,372740," So S1 and S2 and should return the Levinstein distance, right."
372740,374740," So for now it's not going to return anything."
374740,379940," Right, so let's actually come up with the strings that we want to compare."
379940,390480," Let's try to compare things like, I don't know."
390480,394020," So let's take something like apple, right."
394020,406020," And for instance, to change apple to something else, we can say apple, I don't know, dappled,"
406020,407020," whatever."
407020,411640," I don't know what that is, but it's just like the same string, but with additional character."
411640,416580," And we want this algorithm to return one in that specific case, right."
416580,423180," So in the case of a sort of the same string, it should return zero, right."
423180,425080," It should return zero."
425080,427620," So maybe we want to actually print those things as well."
427620,431880," Maybe we want to print those things as well."
431880,436720," So it's quite important to remember that this is the initial string."
436720,441120," This is like the source and S2 is the destination."
441120,446740," This is the string that we want to achieve by manipulating S1, right."
446740,450980," So let's start looking at some different cases, right."
450980,455040," So for instance, the first case that we're interested in is probably when S1"
455040,460440," is empty, right, so we don't have anything in the initial string."
460440,462080," So what that means?"
462080,471300," That means we have to basically add all of the characters of S2 to turn S1 to S2, right."
471300,474220," So we initially had nothing, right."
474220,476800," So we initially had nothing and we have something like a, a, a."
476800,479100," How to turn this string into this string?"
479100,484540," Well, we have to add a three times, basically the length of the second string."
485000,491140," So that means the result in this particular case is going to be the length of S2."
491140,498320," So that's the simplest case that we can have in here."
498320,503280," So we have another sub from Willi Kalepni Maestro."
503280,504280," I hope I pronounced your nickname correctly."
504280,507700," Thank you so much for tier one subscription with a message."
507700,508840," All right."
508840,521180," So, so what's the next case?"
521180,524840," So we can take a look at the case when we have something opposite, right."
524840,529880," So when we have something opposite, for instance, when we have something in the first string,"
529980,532540," but the destination is actually empty string."
532540,534920," So what do we do in that specific case?"
534920,537720," How can we turn this into this?"
537720,542120," Well, we can just remove all of the characters from the first string."
542120,547500," So that means the amount of actions we have to do is the length of the first string, right."
547740,552880," So this is basically the second career case, right."
552880,556540," So S2 is equal to zero, right."
556540,561960," And then we return the length of S1, right."
561960,564380," The length of S1."
564380,569820," Okay, so essentially at this particular point, let me actually do something like assert false"
569820,571940," and let's say not implemented, right."
571940,574100," Because this thing is not implemented yet."
574100,576240," Right."
576240,584880," So at this point, essentially, what we have is non-empty strings, right."
584880,586340," We have non-empty strings."
587100,598380," So the solution for the Levenstein problem, I'm not sure if it's a correct way to say it like that."
598380,603860," So the implementation of the Levenstein function is usually very much recursive."
603860,616860," So that means we can assume that we can compute the Levenstein distance for substrings of S1 and S2."
617100,617780," Right."
617780,625340," So essentially, we have an opportunity to actually call Lev on substrings of S1 and S2."
625340,630040," For instance, we can just do that on their tail, something like that."
630040,631200," Right."
631200,636420," And basically, recursively go down and compute things on a smaller and smaller strings"
636420,638920," until one of them hits the zero."
638920,644420," And once one of them hits the zero, we basically return the length of another one, right."
644760,648280," So that's basically how the entire idea works."
648280,654060," So essentially, I suppose it's a strategy usually called divide and conquer, right."
654060,659460," So we have a bigger task and we split it into smaller subtasks until they become trivial."
659460,664540," And then we return the trivial solution and then build up a more and more complex solution."
664540,665620," Right."
665620,666640," That's how it usually works."
666640,671020," But I'm not sure how to take the tail of the string in Python, right."
671020,675960," So for instance, I have something like hello and I suppose you just put minus one at..."
675960,676500," Yeah, there we go."
676500,680320," So this is basically the tail of this entire thing, right."
680320,685260," So I think it would be nice to actually draw a little bit, right."
685260,690000," Draw a little bit and see what kind of stuff we can have in here."
691800,700700," Alrighty, so essentially, let's pretend that I have S1, so the initial string and S2."
700700,703980," So let's say this is going to be something like this."
712580,712760," Okay."
712760,718140," So what we want to do, we want to turn this into this, right."
718140,721100," So somehow we want to turn this into this string."
721100,725100," So let's try to do the following thing."
725100,732620," What if I call lev tail of S1 and S2, right."
732620,737400," So essentially, what if I try to compute the Levenstein distance between the first string,"
737400,740520," but with one less character to the full string?"
740520,742540," What that means?"
742540,746940," That means I'll get amount of actions."
746940,751120," I'll get amount of actions to turn this string."
751120,753860," So I basically removed this character from here, right."
753860,756880," This string into this one, right."
756880,760840," So what that means?"
761020,764400," That means it is possible to turn this string into the final one."
764400,769360," That means this character is not really needed."
769360,778840," So calling lev with the tail of S1, but full S2 actually indicates a removal of a character."
778840,783160," By asking the function, this sort of question,"
783280,787740," how do I turn a smaller string into the final one?"
787740,789760," You basically answer the question,"
789760,793820," how does it, how is it going to go if I remove this character?"
793820,796920," So this sort of indicates the removal."
796920,799740," That's the removal action, right."
799740,803460," So we can ask a different question, right."
803460,810940," What's the S1 is full, but S2 is actually the tail, right."
811040,812220," So how that would look like."
812220,814540," So let's actually say that this is a removal."
814540,816820," Remove."
816820,819640," All right."
819640,821540," So S1, S2."
821540,824040," So let's put it like this."
824040,833740," So essentially now we are taking the full S1,"
833740,835980," but we are removing one character from here."
837320,842420," So, and we say, how to turn this string into this one, right."
842420,846780," We found the amount of actions that needs to turn this thing into this thing,"
846780,848480," but without this character."
848480,851800," And to turn it into the full final string,"
851800,854880," we just need to add that final character."
854880,858000," By rephrasing this question like that,"
858000,863720," we're basically defining the add action, right."
864520,867540," So by defining the question like this,"
867540,869160," we remove a character."
869160,870380," By defining the question like this,"
870380,872360," we add the character."
872360,873940," You see what I mean?"
873940,874780," Right."
874780,878080," So essentially by just taking the substrings slightly differently,"
878080,880040," you're basically asking two different questions."
880040,882160," Like how it's going to look like when you remove a character"
882160,884680," and how it's going to look like when you add a character."
884680,885720," Right."
886200,887800," So does it make sense?"
887800,890080," I think it kind of makes sense."
890080,891560," And the last thing you can do,"
891560,893560," you can actually remove the character from both of them."
893560,893980," Right."
893980,897720," So we can do Levenstein S1 tail, right."
897720,902460," S1 tail and then S2 tail."
902460,905360," So what does that signify?"
905360,906760," What does it even mean?"
906760,910240," What kind of question do we ask by removing both of the characters?"
910460,911460," So let's actually take a look."
911460,913640," S1, S2."
913640,915300," Right."
915300,917420," So we have something like this."
917420,924000," And something like this."
924000,925560," So we remove this character,"
925560,927680," remove this character and ask,"
927680,931900," how do you turn this substring into this substring?"
932460,935900," So basically here we effectively,"
935900,939620," we know how to turn this small string into this small string,"
939620,941640," but to get the final string,"
941640,945480," we're replacing this character with this character."
945480,948600," So this signifies a replace action."
948600,950040," Right."
950040,952340," So here we have a replace."
952340,954140," And look at that."
954140,957720," This is literally three different actions"
957720,959560," denoted in the original formula."
959560,961840," These are the actions in here."
962460,963600," We just decoded them."
963600,964820," For instance,"
964820,966860," if you want to have different sets of actions,"
966860,967540," or for instance,"
967540,969320," if you have a problem that doesn't have a replace,"
969320,971460," you just don't have this specific case."
971460,975620," And now you know how to sort of ask questions"
975620,977240," about different kinds of actions"
977240,978500," you can perform on the strings."
978500,980680," Maybe you can come up with your own actions."
980680,982320," Right."
982320,985080," So now it is more of a flexible system."
985080,986520," And maybe in here,"
986520,989440," you can even sort of like track the actions"
989440,991720," depending on which one you have to pick."
992100,992220," Right."
992220,993000," So at each point,"
993000,995140," you have to actually pick a minimum between them."
995140,995480," Right."
995480,996460," Because you're optimizing,"
996460,998920," you're trying to find the minimum amount of actions."
998920,1000100," Right."
1000100,1002920," So while you're trying to find a minimum,"
1002920,1005420," you can also keep track of which one did you pick"
1005420,1007920," and maybe add it to some sort of a log."
1008520,1011720," And now you kind of have the list of actions"
1011720,1012800," that you have to perform."
1012800,1013520," Right."
1013520,1016740," Do you know what I mean?"
1024740,1025080," All right."
1025080,1025080," All right."
1025080,1026420," So,"
1026420,1028980," but there is another interesting case."
1028980,1031580," There is another interesting case when,"
1031580,1034540," for instance,"
1034540,1035740," both of the strings"
1035740,1037500," end with the same character."
1037500,1038060," Right."
1038060,1038780," So,"
1038780,1039780," for instance,"
1039780,1041160," let's do it like this."
1042240,1042700," So,"
1042700,1043860," we can have a situation"
1043860,1045560," when both of them end with A."
1045560,1047200," Right."
1047200,1047420," So,"
1047420,1049120," this is the second string."
1049120,1052220," Second string."
1052220,1053100," It's S1,"
1053100,1053800," S2."
1053800,1055940," And what's interesting is that"
1055940,1057720," in this particular case,"
1057720,1058580," what we need to do,"
1058580,1060300," we just need to turn this substring"
1060300,1061440," into this substring."
1061440,1062280," Right."
1062920,1065860," without touching this character at all."
1065860,1066740," Right."
1066740,1069320," We can essentially just ignore this character."
1069320,1069660," So,"
1069660,1071240," the amount of actions that we have to perform"
1071240,1072120," is the amount of actions"
1072120,1073980," to turn this smaller substring"
1073980,1075820," into this smaller substring."
1075820,1076940," But it only works"
1076940,1078680," if the last characters,"
1078680,1080360," two last characters are the same."
1080360,1081440," Right."
1081440,1082040," So,"
1082040,1083320," this is another interesting thing."
1083320,1084760," And this kind of signifies"
1084760,1087260," the action of ignoring the character."
1087260,1087860," Right."
1087860,1089740," Leaving the character where it was."
1089740,1090100," So,"
1090100,1092860," you may think that you have three"
1092860,1093820," actions in here,"
1093820,1094440," like add,"
1094440,1094960," remove,"
1094960,1095760," and replace."
1095760,1096560," In reality,"
1096560,1098200," you actually have four of them."
1098200,1099480," Another one is ignore."
1099480,1101340," But ignore is kind of like"
1101340,1102620," implied."
1102620,1103040," Like,"
1103040,1103580," it's implicit."
1103580,1104560," Right."
1104560,1105400," So,"
1105400,1107340," and you can encode it like this,"
1107340,1107840," basically."
1107840,1108220," If,"
1108220,1110580," how do you take the last character"
1110580,1111680," of the,"
1111680,1112960," of the string?"
1112960,1113740," I don't really remember."
1113740,1114500," So,"
1114500,1115760," we need to do Python 3."
1115760,1116840," Right."
1116840,1117280," Hello."
1117280,1118440," And I think it's like"
1118440,1119580," literally minus one."
1119580,1119900," Yeah."
1119900,1121360," It's just minus one."
1121360,1121620," Okay."
1122800,1123240," So,"
1123240,1124240," here we can do"
1124240,1125640," S1 minus one"
1125640,1127640," equal S2 minus one."
1127640,1129700," In this specific case,"
1129700,1130540," we can just straight up"
1130540,1132620," return like this thing."
1132620,1133420," Right."
1133420,1135660," And if"
1135660,1137400," we got past"
1137400,1138080," all of these"
1138080,1138860," checks,"
1138860,1139800," we can just return"
1139800,1140300," the,"
1140300,1141380," the minimum of them."
1141380,1141840," Right."
1141840,1142520," And there we go."
1142520,1143400," We just implemented,"
1143400,1144820," we actually reinvented"
1144820,1146420," the whole formula"
1146420,1147920," that can be found"
1147920,1148620," in Wikipedia."
1148940,1150260," but we actually went through"
1150260,1151280," each individual case"
1151280,1151640," in here"
1151640,1152240," and understood"
1152240,1154540," what each individual case does."
1154540,1154840," Right."
1154840,1155040," So,"
1155040,1155700," here we have"
1155700,1157600," four different actions."
1157600,1158180," Ignore,"
1158180,1160180," remove,"
1160180,1161420," add,"
1161420,1162760," and replace."
1162760,1163600," Right."
1163760,1163960," So,"
1163960,1164600," here they are."
1164600,1167300," So,"
1167300,1168480," and now"
1168480,1171160," we can try to go ahead"
1171160,1172080," and maybe run"
1172080,1174440," this entire thing."
1174440,1175120," So,"
1175120,1176000," let me do,"
1176000,1176900," and there we go."
1176900,1177560," So,"
1177560,1178340," in the first case,"
1178340,1179340," we're turning apple"
1179340,1180260," into apple"
1180260,1181280," and the amount"
1181280,1181680," of actions"
1181680,1182320," you have to do"
1182320,1182700," in here"
1182700,1183620," is actually zero."
1183620,1184880," To turn apple"
1184880,1185620," into dapple,"
1185620,1186660," you actually have"
1186660,1187380," to do one action,"
1187380,1188360," which makes sense."
1188360,1188660," Right."
1188660,1189420," So,"
1189420,1189960," for instance,"
1189960,1191480," if you have to add"
1191480,1193180," additional d in here,"
1193180,1193740," right,"
1193740,1197020," which doesn't really work,"
1197020,1197440," right,"
1197440,1197800," so,"
1197800,1199080," that's kind of,"
1199080,1200800," that's kind of interesting."
1200800,1201320," So,"
1201320,1202500," that means we"
1202500,1204080," made a oopsie-doopsie"
1204080,1204820," and potentially"
1204820,1205600," fucky-wacky."
1205600,1206960," So,"
1206960,1207740," because"
1207740,1209440," in all of these"
1209440,1210380," three actions,"
1210380,1211660," remove,"
1211660,1212100," add,"
1212100,1212840," and replace,"
1212840,1214200," we don't actually"
1214200,1214860," add one,"
1214860,1215520," right,"
1215520,1216280," so we take"
1216280,1217100," the amount of actions"
1217100,1218120," to turn smaller strings"
1218120,1218920," into this one"
1218920,1219440," and,"
1219440,1220200," or this down"
1220200,1220920," into this one,"
1220920,1221740," but I completely"
1221740,1222220," ignore that"
1222220,1223140," you have to,"
1223140,1223640," like,"
1223640,1224440," add the fact"
1224440,1225140," that we added"
1225140,1225720," or removed"
1225720,1226460," or replaced"
1226460,1227000," the character."
1227000,1227280," So,"
1227280,1228140," when we do min,"
1228140,1229300," we have to do"
1229300,1229800," plus one,"
1229800,1230260," right,"
1230260,1231280," so that actually"
1231280,1232060," kind of makes sense."
1232060,1233720," Alright,"
1233720,1235500," so this is two now,"
1235500,1236960," and if I remove"
1236960,1237420," one d,"
1237740,1238420," right,"
1238420,1239220," so it's actually,"
1239220,1240260," it's actually one."
1240260,1242220," I can do one d in here"
1242220,1243720," and then I can remove one p,"
1243720,1246180," so which should turn"
1246180,1247680," this Levenstein distance"
1247680,1248340," into three,"
1248340,1248800," right,"
1248800,1249320," as you can see,"
1249320,1249980," it says three"
1249980,1251220," because it had to add"
1251220,1252460," two additional characters"
1252460,1253520," and remove one,"
1253520,1254960," right,"
1254960,1256100," so it had to remove one."
1256100,1257200," You can keep removing them"
1257200,1258480," and keep increasing"
1258480,1260140," and so on"
1260140,1260720," and to force."
1260720,1262540," But it's still four"
1262540,1263380," because it basically"
1263380,1264440," reused that l,"
1264440,1265140," I suppose,"
1265140,1266920," or maybe it replaced something,"
1267160,1269660," so that's basically"
1269660,1270680," what we have in here."
1270680,1272500," Does it make sense?"
1272500,1273600," Does it make sense,"
1273600,1273920," chat?"
1273920,1275860," I think it does make sense."
1275860,1276960," I really like this algorithm."
1276960,1278040," So,"
1278040,1280620," why plus one?"
1280620,1281920," Because"
1281920,1283740," when you are"
1283740,1285440," taking a Levenstein distance"
1285440,1285820," between"
1285820,1287520," a smaller substring"
1287520,1289060," to the bigger one,"
1289060,1290260," you're competing"
1290260,1291180," the amount of actions"
1291180,1293680," without including"
1293680,1294460," the removal"
1294460,1295420," of that one"
1295420,1296220," that you just ignored."
1296220,1298720," Make sense?"
1298720,1300240," Right,"
1300240,1301140," and in this case,"
1301140,1301640," you're competing"
1301640,1302640," the Levenstein distance"
1302640,1303740," to the smallest string"
1303740,1304540," without accounting"
1304540,1305920," that you have to add this one."
1305920,1306960," And here,"
1306960,1308100," you also need to account"
1308100,1308760," the replacement."
1308760,1309080," So,"
1309080,1310200," in all of these three cases,"
1310200,1311260," you have to add plus one."
1311260,1312340," So,"
1312340,1313020," effectively,"
1313020,1313880," it would be something"
1313880,1314540," more like"
1314540,1316440," plus one"
1316440,1317380," for each case"
1317380,1317880," in here,"
1317880,1318460," right?"
1318460,1320120," Because in the first case,"
1320120,1320940," you remove a character,"
1320940,1322000," you need to do plus one,"
1322000,1322800," plus one action."
1322800,1323840," In case in here,"
1323840,1324240," you add,"
1324240,1325060," replace,"
1325060,1326500," but since you do plus one"
1326500,1327220," in all of the cases,"
1327220,1328760," it's just easy to put plus one"
1328760,1330240," outside of the minimum."
1330240,1338740," I've never heard of this algorithm."
1338740,1339440," It's very interesting."
1339440,1339700," Yeah,"
1339700,1340780," it is also very useful"
1340780,1343120," and it's used quite a lot"
1343120,1344680," in different applications,"
1344680,1345040," like,"
1345040,1346180," you know,"
1346180,1347320," console applications,"
1347380,1348060," and stuff like that"
1348060,1349000," to recommend you"
1349000,1349740," the,"
1349740,1350760," you know,"
1350760,1352740," the closest command."
1352740,1353780," I already demonstrated"
1353780,1354500," that example."
1354500,1355000," For instance,"
1355000,1355420," in Git,"
1355420,1357420," if you do something like this,"
1357420,1357960," right,"
1357960,1358940," at some point,"
1358940,1360120," it will start"
1360120,1360880," recommending you,"
1360880,1361040," yeah,"
1361040,1361560," for example,"
1361560,1363620," I put SDF,"
1363620,1364680," but it thought maybe"
1364680,1365640," I meant ADD."
1365640,1365980," So,"
1365980,1367000," it probably computed"
1367000,1368120," Levenstein distance"
1368120,1369640," between these two sub-commands"
1369640,1370620," and came to the conclusion"
1370620,1371800," that maybe you made a typo."
1371800,1373180," I don't know."
1373180,1374540," If I do something like"
1374540,1375760," ADD,"
1375760,1376240," D,"
1376460,1377000," it will still"
1377000,1377620," recommend D."
1377620,1379020," Right."
1379020,1379260," So,"
1379260,1380440," I presume it uses"
1380440,1381320," Levenstein distance,"
1381320,1382360," but I'm not sure,"
1382360,1383600," I'm 100% sure,"
1383600,1384880," but it's the most logical"
1384880,1385820," thing to use in here."
1385820,1386660," So,"
1386660,1387600," the problem with"
1387600,1389980," this specific implementation"
1389980,1392280," of the Levenstein distance"
1392280,1393120," is that"
1393120,1394520," it's exponential."
1394520,1395700," So,"
1395700,1396200," that means"
1396200,1397280," if you have"
1397280,1399280," strings"
1399280,1400220," that are"
1400220,1401300," like that,"
1401300,1402920," not that much big,"
1402920,1403620," right,"
1403620,1405500," not that much big,"
1405500,1406580," it's already"
1406580,1407520," going to struggle"
1407520,1408720," to compute anything."
1408720,1409860," So,"
1409860,1410940," look how much time"
1410940,1411740," it takes for it"
1411740,1413060," to compute the distance"
1413060,1413900," between two strings,"
1413900,1414740," these two strings."
1418240,1418720," so,"
1418720,1423200," I'm not sure"
1423200,1423940," if it may be actually"
1423940,1425880," taking a lot of memory,"
1425880,1427180," but yeah."
1427180,1429400," So,"
1429400,1431020," this is because"
1431020,1433060," it basically calls"
1433060,1433540," to"
1433540,1435760," the same arguments"
1435760,1436820," over and over again."
1436820,1437560," I'm pretty sure"
1437560,1438160," you can actually"
1438160,1439020," speed it up"
1439020,1440660," by enabling"
1440660,1441400," memorization"
1441400,1443000," for this entire function."
1443000,1443280," So,"
1443280,1443720," as far as"
1443720,1444760," Python has"
1444760,1445540," like a built-in"
1445540,1446200," memorization,"
1446200,1448100," does anyone know?"
1448100,1448840," I'm pretty sure"
1448840,1449180," it does."
1449180,1449640," Python"
1449640,1450900," memorization,"
1450900,1452160," right."
1452160,1453720," So,"
1453720,1454560," Python memorization."
1454560,1454920," So,"
1454920,1455960," what happens"
1455960,1456340," is that"
1456340,1457300," it just computes"
1457300,1457760," Lev"
1457760,1458640," for the same"
1458640,1459160," arguments"
1459160,1460120," over and over again."
1460120,1460920," We can actually"
1460920,1461940," kind of confirm that."
1461940,1462880," Right,"
1462880,1463600," so let's actually"
1463600,1464760," literally just"
1464760,1465660," print S1"
1465660,1466400," and S2"
1466400,1466980," every time"
1466980,1467580," we're computing"
1467580,1468080," this thing."
1468700,1469180," Right,"
1469180,1469720," so let's do"
1469720,1470180," ADD."
1470180,1472140," ADDD."
1472140,1473040," Right,"
1473040,1473640," there we go."
1473640,1475220," So,"
1475220,1478800," it actually"
1478800,1479400," doesn't really"
1479400,1479960," do that"
1479960,1481640," very often"
1481640,1482240," like in this"
1482240,1482920," specific case."
1482920,1484660," Right,"
1484660,1485340," but if we"
1485340,1486100," have something"
1486100,1486540," bigger,"
1486540,1488760," I think"
1488760,1489020," it's going"
1489020,1489440," to end up"
1489440,1489860," with a lot"
1489860,1490480," of like cases"
1490480,1491080," that are"
1491080,1492060," basically the"
1492060,1492360," same."
1492360,1494760," Right,"
1494760,1495220," it keeps"
1495220,1495780," recomputing"
1495780,1496280," the same"
1496280,1497040," cases over"
1497040,1497620," and over again."
1498180,1498840," so if I"
1498840,1499280," try to"
1499280,1499960," like copy"
1499960,1500460," and just"
1500460,1501080," search for"
1501080,1502400," I probably"
1502400,1503040," need to"
1503040,1504440," do"
1504440,1504960," something"
1504960,1505560," like this."
1505560,1511800," Yeah,"
1511800,1513640," there we go."
1513640,1514260," So these are"
1514260,1514880," all of the"
1514880,1515800," cases."
1515800,1517180," So these are"
1517180,1517680," the arguments"
1517680,1518140," and I keep"
1518140,1518820," scrolling through"
1518820,1519200," all of them."
1519200,1519700," There is a lot"
1519700,1520000," of them"
1520000,1520820," actually."
1521860,1522240," right,"
1522240,1522660," it keeps"
1522660,1523280," recomputing"
1523280,1523660," like the"
1523660,1524180," same argument"
1524180,1524620," over and"
1524620,1525080," over again."
1525080,1526040," So it"
1526040,1526320," would be"
1526320,1526740," nice to"
1526740,1527240," basically"
1527240,1527840," cache"
1527840,1529300," some of"
1529300,1529460," these"
1529460,1529860," arguments"
1529860,1531100," and don't"
1531100,1531580," recompute"
1531580,1532020," them over"
1532020,1532320," and over"
1532320,1532560," again"
1532560,1533080," because that's"
1533080,1533440," basically"
1533440,1533920," what takes"
1533920,1534280," a lot of"
1534280,1534580," time."
1534580,1537240," So as far"
1537240,1537560," as I know,"
1537560,1538460," Python has a"
1538460,1538940," memoization"
1538940,1539580," module of"
1539580,1540060," some sort"
1540060,1541540," right,"
1541540,1542080," has a"
1542080,1542540," memoization"
1542540,1542860," module."
1542860,1546940," So"
1546940,1551360," functool"
1551360,1552040," cache."
1552040,1552740," Okay,"
1552740,1553400," so let's"
1553400,1553900," actually try"
1553900,1554360," to import"
1554360,1554700," this into"
1554700,1555080," that one."
1555080,1556460," So functool"
1556460,1557060," cache and"
1557060,1557900," it works"
1557900,1558280," as a"
1558280,1558780," decorator,"
1558780,1559080," right?"
1559080,1559560," So as far"
1559560,1559780," as I know,"
1559780,1560080," it's just"
1560080,1560400," basically"
1560400,1560880," decorator."
1560880,1561740," Functools"
1561740,1563540," cache and"
1563540,1563980," let's try"
1563980,1564760," to run"
1564760,1565140," this thing"
1565140,1565420," now."
1565420,1566840," Functools"
1566840,1567360," has no"
1567360,1567780," attribute"
1567780,1568440," cache"
1568440,1570840," so 3.9"
1570840,1571400," I don't"
1571400,1571720," have a"
1571720,1572220," 3.9"
1572220,1573240," so I"
1573240,1573920," think the"
1573920,1574640," latest version"
1574640,1575040," of Python"
1575040,1575320," I had"
1575320,1576180," 3.7"
1576180,1576700," god damn"
1576700,1576900," it."
1576900,1577880," So is"
1577880,1578520," there any"
1578520,1579720," okay so"
1579720,1580060," there is"
1580060,1580880," LRU"
1580880,1581300," cache"
1581300,1582720," okay so"
1582720,1583600," we can use"
1583600,1583820," that."
1583820,1585500," So LRU"
1585500,1586280," LRU"
1586280,1586980," cache and"
1586980,1587800," what do"
1587800,1588120," we have to"
1588120,1588380," do we have"
1588380,1588780," to specify"
1588780,1589440," max size?"
1589440,1589960," I probably"
1589960,1590620," have to but"
1590620,1591640," why this is"
1591640,1592000," not a"
1592000,1592680," default thing"
1592680,1593040," in here?"
1593040,1594040," I have no"
1594040,1594640," idea and"
1594640,1595000," that was"
1595000,1595860," fast relatively"
1595860,1596640," I suppose"
1596640,1598240," right so"
1598240,1598740," yeah as"
1598740,1598940," you can"
1598940,1599360," see it's"
1599360,1600020," super fast"
1600020,1600280," and it"
1600280,1600800," says it's"
1600800,1601040," 2?"
1601040,1601940," Really?"
1601940,1603460," Well yeah I"
1603460,1604140," accidentally made"
1604140,1604640," it that it's"
1604640,1605280," actually 2."
1605280,1606800," Okay that's"
1606800,1607060," funny."
1607060,1610600," Yeah it has"
1610600,1611380," to actually"
1611380,1614200," remove this"
1614200,1614720," one and"
1614720,1615360," this one"
1615360,1616180," right if I"
1616180,1616700," take this"
1616700,1617840," string and"
1617840,1618340," I remove"
1618340,1618980," these things"
1618980,1619680," I end up"
1619680,1620220," yeah so"
1620220,1620860," that's why"
1620860,1621180," it's 2"
1621180,1621540," which makes"
1621540,1622120," sense right"
1622120,1622480," and you can"
1622480,1622960," do that on"
1622960,1623440," the bigger"
1623440,1624140," strings now"
1624140,1625420," right so"
1625420,1625780," and it"
1625780,1626540," will work"
1626540,1627180," super fast"
1627180,1627860," so we"
1627860,1628160," can add"
1628160,1628800," a little bit"
1628800,1629160," more in"
1629160,1629400," here"
1629400,1631040," and yeah"
1631040,1632800," now 15"
1632800,1633560," but if we"
1633560,1634540," remove the"
1634540,1635080," caching in"
1635080,1635860," here right"
1635860,1636360," if we remove"
1636360,1636820," the caching"
1636820,1638100," it will go"
1638100,1638540," forever"
1638540,1639600," right it"
1639600,1639880," will go"
1639880,1640200," forever"
1640200,1641080," not forever"
1641080,1641800," but for a"
1641800,1642200," very long"
1642200,1642660," time and"
1642660,1643100," maybe it"
1643100,1644080," will take"
1644080,1644520," up all of"
1644520,1644800," the memory"
1644800,1645220," of my"
1645220,1646180," like poor"
1646180,1646660," laptop"
1646660,1648080," probably won't"
1648080,1648540," I mean"
1648540,1649100," if it fit"
1649100,1649780," nah it"
1649780,1651000," may go"
1651000,1651580," too deep"
1651580,1652900," but here"
1652900,1653380," it is"
1653380,1653980," super"
1653980,1654600," super"
1654600,1655180," fast"
1655180,1655720," right"
1655720,1656440," so you"
1656440,1656740," can call"
1656740,1657060," it a day"
1657060,1659560," you can"
1659560,1660080," call it a day"
1660080,1661300," but the"
1661300,1662000," most interesting"
1662000,1662600," thing"
1662600,1664440," actually"
1664440,1666520," arises"
1666520,1667860," when you"
1667860,1668440," try to"
1668440,1668920," implement"
1668920,1669640," this kind"
1669640,1670100," of cache"
1670100,1670720," yourself"
1670720,1671560," right"
1671560,1672720," this kind"
1672720,1673080," of cache"
1673080,1673520," yourself"
1673520,1673880," so"
1673880,1674960," how can"
1674960,1675320," we cache"
1675320,1675520," that"
1675520,1675800," we can"
1675800,1676100," just like"
1676100,1676480," put some"
1676480,1676740," sort of"
1676740,1677100," like a"
1677100,1677460," dictionary"
1677460,1678580," right"
1678580,1679160," some sort"
1679160,1679380," of a"
1679380,1679800," dictionary"
1679800,1682900," and"
1682900,1683900," where the"
1683900,1684240," key of"
1684240,1684740," the dictionary"
1684740,1685020," are going"
1685020,1685240," to be"
1685240,1685800," these two"
1685800,1686200," strings"
1686200,1687180," and the"
1687180,1687860," value of"
1687860,1688320," the dictionary"
1688320,1688620," is going"
1688620,1688780," to be"
1688780,1690620," the result"
1690620,1691000," of this"
1691000,1691340," function"
1691340,1692700," but"
1692700,1693780," we"
1693780,1695220," don't"
1695220,1695800," really have"
1695800,1696540," to use"
1696540,1697340," the strings"
1697340,1698460," as the"
1698460,1698960," key"
1698960,1699980," we don't"
1699980,1700380," really have"
1700380,1700700," to use"
1700700,1701120," the strings"
1701120,1701420," as the"
1701420,1701600," key"
1701600,1702480," so one"
1702480,1702720," of the"
1702720,1702940," way"
1702940,1703400," people"
1703400,1704440," kind"
1704440,1704620," of"
1704620,1705080," cache"
1705080,1705500," this"
1705500,1705720," sort"
1705720,1705860," of"
1705860,1706240," function"
1706240,1706860," is"
1706860,1709060," bypassing"
1709060,1709460," the"
1709460,1709960," sort"
1709960,1710080," of"
1710080,1710300," like"
1710300,1710540," a"
1710540,1711000," length"
1711000,1711380," of"
1711380,1711580," the"
1711580,1712000," string"
1712000,1712660," along"
1712660,1713120," with"
1713120,1713340," the"
1713340,1713740," string"
1713740,1714660," so"
1714660,1715180," yeah"
1715180,1715420," as you"
1715420,1715700," can see"
1715700,1716080," in here"
1716080,1716580," we take"
1716580,1717100," substrings"
1717100,1717460," all the"
1717460,1717740," time"
1717740,1718720," let's"
1718720,1719260," always"
1719260,1719880," put"
1719880,1720620," let's"
1720620,1721140," always"
1721140,1721620," put"
1721620,1722040," the"
1722040,1724420," the"
1724420,1724740," full"
1724740,1725240," string"
1725240,1725840," as an"
1725840,1726140," argument"
1726140,1726600," here"
1726600,1727240," all the"
1727240,1727580," time"
1727580,1728640," but"
1728640,1729480," instead"
1729480,1729900," of taking"
1729900,1730420," substrings"
1730420,1730680," we're"
1730680,1730840," going to"
1730840,1731060," take"
1731060,1731320," the"
1731320,1731740," we're"
1731740,1731940," going to"

1916280,1916640," we can"

1936020,1936240," but"
1936240,1936680," n1"

1945220,1945860," right"
1945860,1946220," so"
1946220,1946480," there we"
1946480,1946640," go"
1946640,1947220," we"

1949660,1949860," what we"

1950000,1951060," so"
1951060,1951620," then"
1951620,1952040," to"
1952040,1952420," take"

1955840,1956160," this"
1956160,1956380," kind"

1956500,1956740," stuff"
1956740,1957100," what"

1957380,1957520," to"
1957520,1957780," do"
1957780,1958260," is just"

1962040,1962680," right"
1962680,1963120," so"
1963120,1963400," does it"
1963400,1963800," make sense"
1963800,1964380," so now"
1964380,1964960," instead of"
1964960,1966040," taking"
1966040,1967000," substrings"
1967000,1968240," we are"
1968240,1968980," reducing"

1973820,1974100," of the"
1974100,1974420," string"
1974420,1975280," so that's"
1975280,1975680," what we're"
1975680,1976300," doing now"
1976300,1976960," does it"

1977480,1978380," right"
1978380,1979360," does it"
1979360,1979780," make sense"
1979780,1980680," hopefully"
1980680,1981100," that makes"
1981100,1981320," sense"
1981320,1983420," right"
1983420,1984000," so"
1984000,1985940," now"
1985940,1986900," I can"
1986900,1987260," so"
1987260,1987840," I need to"

1989180,1989600," so that"
1989600,1989800," means"
1989800,1990260," now I"
1990260,1990600," just have"
1990600,1990840," to do"
1990840,1991300," n1"
1991300,1992020," minus 1"

2007640,2008440," that's"
2008440,2008780," basically"
2008780,2009320," how we"

3089460,3089660," really"

3100120,3100720," compress"
3100720,3101320," this entire"

3104400,3104540," we"

3107320,3107920," and"
3107920,3108480," let's"
3108480,3108760," get rid"
3108760,3108880," of"

3109280,3109680," printing"
3109680,3110080," because"

3111520,3112400," okay"

3114920,3115800," ppprint"
3115800,3117580," let me"
3117580,3117940," see"

3123040,3124100," like"
3124100,3124720," so"
3124720,3125440," and let's"
3125440,3126160," see if that"
3126160,3126760," changed"
3126760,3127580," anything"
3127580,3128060," that is"
3128060,3128560," actually"
3128560,3129440," way better"
3129440,3130820," what would be"
3130820,3131420," even cooler"
3131420,3132180," is probably"
3132180,3132980," to have an"
3132980,3133700," extra new"
3133700,3134100," line"
3134100,3135080," at the end"
3135080,3135360," of this"
3135360,3135680," entire"
3135680,3136000," stuff"
3136000,3136260," right"
3136260,3136600," so we"
3136600,3137160," can see"
3137160,3138720," the differences"
3138720,3139200," in here"
3139200,3139700," so as you"
3139700,3140020," can see"
3140020,3140200," yeah"
3140200,3140800," it works"
3140800,3141020," kind"
3141020,3141100," of"
3141100,3141380," nice"
3141380,3142220," so"
3142220,3142380," I"
3142380,3142600," suppose"
3142600,3142840," the"
3142840,3143140," problem"
3143140,3143560," why"
3143560,3143900," it"
3143900,3144300," looks"
3144300,3144980," so"
3144980,3145740," you"
3145740,3145860," know"
3145860,3146320," empty"
3146320,3147180," is"
3147180,3147480," probably"
3147480,3147820," because"
3147820,3148020," we"
3148020,3148440," also"
3148440,3149200," don't"
3149200,3149640," print"
3149640,3149900," it"
3149900,3150740," fully"
3150740,3151240," right"
3151240,3151560," so let's"
3151560,3152080," actually try to"
3152080,3152440," print it"
3152440,3153300," even when"
3153300,3153920," we try to"

3154860,3155060," cache"
3155060,3155280," maybe"
3155280,3155680," this is"
3155680,3155840," what"
3155840,3156080," we're"
3156080,3156300," missing"
3156300,3157500," no"
3157500,3157880," really"
3157880,3158140," like"

3163460,3166420," that is"
3166420,3166620," rather"
3166620,3167140," interesting"
3167140,3168460," that is"
3168460,3168680," rather"
3168680,3169180," interesting"
3169180,3171480," what if"
3171480,3172020," we try"
3172020,3172420," to"
3172420,3173980," maybe"
3173980,3174260," have"
3174260,3174620," something"
3174620,3175100," like"
3175100,3176020," food"
3176020,3176580," and"
3176580,3177260," food"
3177260,3179860," right"
3179860,3180640," it never"
3180640,3180980," actually"
3180980,3181500," goes"
3181500,3183100," but maybe"
3183100,3183460," that's"
3183460,3183880," fine"
3183880,3184860," maybe"
3184860,3185240," that's"
3185240,3185580," fine"
3185580,3188180," okay"
3188180,3189120," so what"
3189120,3189380," if we"
3189380,3190080," try to"
3190080,3190560," have"
3190560,3190960," things"
3190960,3191400," that are"
3191400,3191960," longer"
3191960,3192600," right"
3192600,3193120," something"
3193120,3193360," like"
3193360,3193700," this"
3193700,3196160," all right"
3196160,3196420," and it's"
3196420,3196580," going"
3196580,3197060," places"
3197060,3197440," it's"
3197440,3197660," actually"
3197660,3198020," prints"
3198020,3198320," a lot"
3198320,3198460," of"
3198460,3198800," stuff"
3198800,3200680," all right"
3200680,3201700," so"
3201700,3202740," yeah"
3202740,3203240," and it"
3203240,3203460," never"

3211260,3212280," all right"

3214060,3214540," still"
3214540,3214780," kind"
3214780,3214900," of"
3214900,3215260," weird"
3215260,3218560," but it"
3218560,3218960," is"
3218960,3219580," what it"
3219580,3219940," is"
3219940,3220420," and it"
3220420,3220900," isn't"
3220900,3221340," what it"
3221340,3221740," isn't"
3221740,3223840," I'm"
3223840,3224000," just"
3224000,3224400," double"
3224400,3224700," checking"
3224700,3225100," everything"
3225100,3225520," just in"
3225520,3225660," case"
3225660,3226000," because I"
3226000,3226280," have a"
3226280,3226500," feeling"
3226500,3226760," that"
3226760,3227160," something"
3227160,3227420," is"
3227420,3227720," wrong"
3227720,3227880," in"
3227880,3228180," here"
3228180,3229080," even"
3229080,3229320," though"
3229320,3229580," it's"
3229580,3229800," probably"
3229800,3230200," not"
3230200,3231160," probably"
3231160,3231600," everything"
3231600,3232100," is okay"
3232100,3232540," in here"
3232540,3233300," and that's"
3233300,3233740," how it's"
3233740,3234220," supposed to"
3234220,3234500," work"
3234500,3235060," but for"
3235060,3235440," some reason"
3235440,3235740," I have"
3235740,3236280," this gut"

3237060,3238320," maybe"
3238320,3238720," something"
3238720,3239240," is wrong"
3239240,3239620," in here"
3239620,3240060," I don't"
3240060,3240320," know"
3240320,3241640," maybe it"
3241640,3241800," just"
3241800,3242160," simply"
3242160,3242500," never"
3242500,3243060," goes"

3244060,3244860," and"
3244860,3245080," the"
3245080,3245340," reason"
3245340,3245660," why"

3247880,3248360," specific"
3248360,3248860," diagonal"
3248860,3249660," is because"
3249660,3250120," we never"
3250120,3250520," have to"
3250520,3250840," remove"
3250840,3251340," anything"
3251340,3251980," what if"
3251980,3252320," we have"
3252320,3252720," something"
3252720,3253100," bigger"
3253100,3253340," than"
3253340,3253720," this"
3253720,3254540," and then"
3254540,3255340," basically"
3255340,3255800," what we have"
3255800,3256060," to do"
3256060,3256540," we have to"
3256540,3257160," remove a lot"

3257760,3259900," to actually"
3259900,3260880," get to the"
3260880,3261480," to the final"
3261480,3261900," thing"
3261900,3263540," would that"
3263540,3264940," be the"
3264940,3265420," situation"
3265420,3266120," so yeah"
3266120,3266540," as you can"
3266540,3266980," see it"
3266980,3267540," effectively"
3267540,3269060," goes"
3269060,3269860," below"

3272100,3272620," in here"
3272620,3273020," right"
3273020,3273460," so to"
3273460,3273900," remove the"
3273900,3274240," characters"
3274240,3274660," if it"
3274660,3274860," needs"
3274860,3275080," to"
3275080,3275420," add"
3275420,3275640," the"
3275640,3276120," characters"
3276120,3277320," it"
3277320,3277920," goes"

3281480,3281840," also"
3281840,3282320," actually"
3282320,3282600," like"
3282600,3283260," changes"
3283260,3283480," it"
3283480,3283740," a little"
3283740,3284000," bit"
3284000,3284740," which"
3284740,3285020," kind of"
3285020,3285180," makes"
3285180,3285520," sense"
3285520,3287320," right"
3287320,3288380," but on top"
3288380,3288600," of that"
3288600,3288860," maybe"
3288860,3290260," for"
3290260,3290680," the"
3290680,3291080," situation"
3291080,3291420," when you"
3291420,3291740," have to"
3291740,3292180," replace"
3292180,3292600," literally"
3292600,3293120," everything"
3293120,3293860," it will"
3293860,3294160," probably"
3294160,3294660," visit"
3294660,3295400," literally"
3295400,3295700," everything"
3295700,3296000," yeah"
3296000,3296680," that's"
3296680,3296860," a good"
3296860,3297200," example"
3297200,3298400," so that's"
3298400,3298900," why I had"
3298900,3299340," this kind"
3299340,3299700," of feeling"
3299700,3300200," right"
3300200,3301100," so"
3301100,3302380," because I"
3302380,3302960," usually test"
3302960,3303340," this kind"
3303340,3303700," of things"
3303700,3304080," on"
3304080,3305000," strings"
3305000,3305720," that are"
3305720,3306280," require"
3306280,3306680," like a"
3306680,3306860," full"
3306860,3307380," replacement"
3307380,3308280," and"
3308280,3308860," when you"
3308860,3309120," do a"
3309120,3309260," full"
3309260,3309640," replacement"
3309640,3310180," it will"
3310180,3310560," attach"
3310560,3310900," each"
3310900,3311300," individual"
3311300,3311780," thing"
3311780,3312400," if it"
3312400,3312760," needs to"
3312760,3313040," only"
3313040,3313500," add"
3313500,3314080," things"
3314080,3314600," right"
3314600,3314860," if you"
3314860,3315120," need to"
3315120,3315540," only add"
3315540,3315740," things"
3315740,3316120," it's probably"
3316120,3316420," going to"
3316420,3316720," stay"
3316720,3317380," on the"
3317380,3317760," above"
3317760,3318380," side"
3318380,3319280," if it"
3319280,3319420," needs"
3319420,3319560," to"
3319560,3319860," remove"
3319860,3320140," it's"
3320140,3320420," going to"
3320420,3320940," stay"
3320940,3321420," below"

3321680,3321900," main"

3322240,3322840," and so"
3322840,3323020," on"
3323020,3323220," so"
3323220,3323560," forth"
3323560,3325180," right"
3325180,3325840," so"
3325840,3326600," yeah"
3326600,3327280," that's"
3327280,3327500," probably"
3327500,3327840," why"
3327840,3328620," I was"
3328620,3328880," a little"
3328880,3329200," bit"
3329200,3331260," confuzzled"
3331260,3332680," it's a"
3332680,3333040," really funny"
3333040,3333320," word"
3333320,3333580," but"
3333920,3334640," anyway"
3334640,3335760," but here's"
3335760,3336160," the interesting"
3336160,3336460," thing"
3336460,3336760," right"

3343000,3343720," about this"

3994140,3994620," something"
3994620,3996500," so"
3996500,3997100," what"
3997100,3997240," does"
3997240,3997400," it"

4000120,4000500," damn"
4000500,4000740," it"
4000740,4001460," so"
4001460,4001780," we"
4001780,4002000," probably"
4002000,4002240," have"

4002500,4002760," something"

4004980,4006360," yeah"
4006360,4006840," boy"
4006840,4007900," boy"
4007900,4008780," there"
4008780,4008940," we"
4008940,4009320," go"
4009320,4009920," look at"
4009920,4010320," that"
4010320,4010780," it's"
4010780,4011220," all"
4011220,4012080," aligned"
4012080,4012940," perfectly"
4012940,4013520," isn't"
4013520,4013700," that"
4013700,4014020," cool"
4014020,4014620," isn't"
4014620,4014840," that"
4014840,4015160," cool"
4015160,4017020," all right"
4017020,4017880," so it's still"
4017880,4018540," kind of slow"
4018540,4019600," which is"
4019600,4020220," really weird"
4020220,4020840," but it is"
4020840,4021440," what it is"
4021440,4023720," okay"
4023720,4025800," very cool"
4025800,4026120," again"
4026120,4027000," very cool"
4027000,4027820," all right"
4027820,4028000," all right"
4028000,4032800," so"
4032800,4033940," let's"
4033940,4034220," actually"
4034220,4034540," maybe"
4034540,4035040," disable"
4035040,4035300," the"
4035300,4035900," tracing"
4035900,4036340," I wonder"
4036340,4036680," if there"
4036680,4037040," is like"
4037040,4037920," an easy"

4038360,4038720," disable"
4038720,4038980," the"
4038980,4039520," tracing"
4039520,4040980," what if"
4040980,4041400," we had"
4041400,4041760," something"
4041760,4042240," like"
4042240,4044460," trace"
4044460,4045420," true"
4045420,4050020," if"
4050020,4050880," trace"
4050880,4052400," do"
4052400,4052960," that"
4052960,4055500," otherwise"
4055500,4057000," can I"
4057000,4057340," just do"
4057340,4057820," something like"
4057820,4058140," def"
4058140,4059460," trace"
4059460,4060060," cache"
4060060,4060880," and then"
4060880,4062400," this"
4062400,4063420," and just"
4063420,4063840," pass"
4063840,4064840," is that"
4064840,4065140," something"
4065140,4065640," possible"
4065640,4067100," okay"
4067100,4068040," so"
4068040,4069960," python"
4069960,4071580," creative"
4071580,4072200," arguments"
4072200,4076480," jesus christ"
4076480,4076820," google"
4076820,4079680," and it's"
4079680,4080000," gonna be"
4080000,4080500," like a"
4080500,4080920," half of"
4080920,4081220," an hour"
4081220,4081740," article"
4081740,4082600," about"
4082600,4083100," their"
4083100,4083640," childhood"
4083640,4084340," or something"
4084340,4084800," something"
4084800,4085140," before"
4085140,4085600," actually"
4085600,4085900," giving"
4085900,4087180," oh my"
4087180,4087380," god"
4087380,4087740," this is"
4087740,4088260," so bad"
4088260,4089440," and it's"
4089440,4090000," so goddamn"
4090000,4090340," fucking"
4090340,4090860," slow"
4090860,4095240," okay"
4095240,4096760," okay"
4096760,4097200," so this"
4097200,4097480," is how"
4097480,4097760," we do"
4097760,4097960," that"
4097960,4098680," all right"
4098680,4104520," cool"
4104520,4106320," um"
4106320,4107600," a good look"
4107600,4107840," hello"
4107840,4108620," what's up"
4108620,4108960," what's up"
4108960,4110720," so whatever"
4110720,4111120," I want you"
4111120,4111300," to do"
4111300,4111660," I want you"
4111660,4112120," to now"
4112120,4112600," check"
4112600,4113240," if I put"
4113240,4113580," false"
4113580,4114020," in here"
4114020,4116260," yeah"
4116260,4116700," it doesn't"
4116700,4116980," trace"
4116980,4117160," anything"
4117160,4117640," so now"
4117640,4117960," I have"
4117960,4118240," like a"
4118240,4118500," sort of"
4118500,4118920," like a"
4118920,4119320," configure"
4119320,4119640," thing"
4119640,4121020," right"
4121020,4121280," where you"
4121280,4121740," can enable"
4121740,4122140," tracing"
4122140,4122680," or disable"
4122680,4123100," tracing"
4123100,4127580," which is"
4127580,4127840," nice"
4127840,4129640," super"
4129640,4130120," super"
4130120,4130420," nice"
4130420,4133980," and I"
4133980,4134320," also want"
4134320,4134700," to compare"
4134700,4135420," this to"
4135420,4136180," a reference"
4136180,4136800," implementation"
4136800,4138220," and a reference"
4138220,4138660," implementation"
4138660,4139700," also returns"
4139700,4140980," nine"
4140980,4142040," right"
4142040,4143140," so and"
4143140,4143960," this is"
4143960,4144400," actually a"
4144400,4144800," very cool"
4144800,4145100," idea"
4145100,4145700," isn't it"
4145700,4146100," right"
4146100,4146580," this is a"
4146580,4146920," very cool"
4146920,4147200," idea"
4147200,4147880," where we"
4147880,4148400," initially"
4148400,4148920," had"
4148920,4150440," like"
4150440,4151740," recursive"
4151740,4153100," solution"
4153100,4153960," like very"
4153960,4154320," recursive"
4154320,4154620," solution"
4154620,4155200," that basically"
4155200,4155660," repeats"
4155660,4156120," the same"
4156120,4156620," computations"
4156620,4157000," over and"
4157000,4157360," over again"
4157360,4158280," and then"
4158280,4158700," we started"
4158700,4159300," to cache"
4159300,4159900," memorize"
4159900,4160620," the function"
4160620,4160980," and then"
4160980,4161580," we realize"
4161580,4162000," that the"
4162000,4162560," cache is"
4162560,4163040," essentially"
4163040,4163580," just a"
4163580,4163840," table"
4163840,4164560," and we"
4164560,4164900," don't even"
4164900,4165440," need the"
4165440,4165940," recursive"
4165940,4166440," function"
4166440,4166780," anymore"
4166780,4167540," to compute"
4167540,4168720," you know"
4168720,4169340," this solution"
4169340,4170020," we can just"
4170020,4171380," directly compute"
4171380,4172040," the caches"
4172040,4173080," right"
4173080,4174840," so there"
4174840,4175980," is a"
4175980,4176900," whole class"
4176900,4177780," of problems"
4177780,4178400," that are"
4178400,4178980," solved"
4178980,4179880," like that"
4179880,4181300," right"
4181300,4182700," so the whole"
4182700,4183360," class of problems"
4183360,4183960," this class of"
4183960,4184460," problems are called"
4184460,4185260," dynamic programming"
4185260,4185880," the dynamic"
4185880,4186260," programming"
4186260,4186760," problems"
4186760,4188680," dynamic"
4188680,4189400," programming"
4189400,4190160," have you guys"
4190160,4190480," heard about"
4190480,4190880," this thing"
4190880,4191660," i'm pretty sure"
4191660,4192200," like a good look"
4192200,4192840," definitely heard"
4192840,4193460," about this thing"
4193460,4194620," why did you put"
4194620,4195500," python in here"
4195500,4196640," are you spying"
4196640,4196900," on me"
4196900,4197540," i mean of course"
4197540,4197940," it's spying"
4197940,4198860," on me"
4198860,4199960," right dynamic"
4199960,4200380," programming"
4200380,4200940," right"
4200940,4202560," so and essentially"
4202560,4203320," this is the"
4203320,4205580," why do you have"
4205580,4206760," integrals"
4206760,4207200," in here"
4207200,4208580," this is a"
4208580,4208820," fucking"
4208820,4209680," classic"
4209680,4211640," wikipedia"
4211640,4212640," i swear"
4212640,4213120," to god"
4213120,4213720," you google"
4213720,4214120," up"
4214120,4214740," something"
4214740,4216160," something"
4216160,4216600," very"
4216600,4217360," straightforward"
4217360,4217900," that has"
4217900,4218200," to be"
4218200,4218620," super"
4218620,4219020," simple"
4219020,4219400," and"
4219400,4220360," this is"
4220360,4220780," the first"
4220780,4220960," thing"
4220960,4221320," you see"
4221320,4222160," jesus"
4222160,4222560," fucking"
4222560,4222920," christ"
4222920,4224200," wikipedia"
4224200,4224640," authors"
4224640,4225360," wikipedia"
4225360,4225760," authors"
4225760,4226280," are so"
4226280,4226680," fucking"
4226680,4227020," dense"
4227020,4227260," it's"
4227260,4227780," insane"
4227780,4228100," why"
4228100,4228280," the"
4228280,4228440," fuck"
4228440,4228600," would"
4228600,4228700," you"
4228700,4228900," put"
4228900,4229620," integral"
4229620,4230480," in a"
4230480,4231920," i mean"
4231920,4232480," i understand"
4232480,4232960," that it's"
4232960,4234020," an example"
4234020,4235200," well i mean"
4235200,4235860," dynamic programming"
4235860,4236280," is probably"
4236280,4236700," applicable"
4236700,4237520," in a situation"
4237520,4237900," when there"
4237900,4238200," is also"
4238200,4238600," integrals"
4238600,4239120," but i mean"
4239120,4240620," holy"
4240620,4241020," fucking"
4241020,4241440," shit"
4241440,4244180," don't use"
4244180,4244640," wikipedia"
4244640,4245260," wikipedia is"
4245260,4245560," awful"
4245560,4246980," right"
4246980,4248380," so read"
4248380,4248780," something"
4248780,4249300," like"
4249300,4249960," clrs"
4249960,4250740," clrs"
4250740,4251780," right"
4251780,4252420," so"
4252420,4253000," integration"
4253000,4253540," the algorithm"
4253540,4254140," and of course"
4254140,4254560," it's on"
4254560,4255080," wikipedia"
4255080,4255700," but anyway"
4255700,4257460," so basically"
4257460,4258820," find a copy"
4258820,4259580," of this book"
4259580,4260100," right"
4260100,4260520," and there is"
4260520,4260980," like a whole"
4260980,4261800," chapter on"
4261800,4262560," dynamic programming"
4262560,4263800," in this book"
4263800,4265220," explained without"
4265220,4266040," integrals"
4266040,4266960," integrals"
4266960,4267480," integrals"
4267480,4267820," i don't know"
4267820,4268300," how to pronounce"
4268300,4268740," it correctly"
4268740,4268980," but"
4268980,4269960," without any"
4269960,4270640," of this gate"
4270640,4271000," keeping"
4271000,4271440," bullshit"
4271440,4272360," right"
4272360,4273540," just in simple"
4273540,4273860," terms"
4273860,4274520," but the idea"
4274520,4275100," is that"
4275100,4275800," there is a"
4275800,4276200," class of"
4276200,4276620," problems"
4276620,4277180," that are"
4277180,4277560," solved"
4277560,4278900," with the"
4278900,4279380," recursive"
4279380,4279880," functions"
4279880,4281240," but the"
4281240,4281780," recursive"
4281780,4282460," functions"
4282460,4283020," with which"
4283020,4283440," you solve"
4283440,4283920," this problem"
4283920,4284420," tend to"
4284420,4284920," recompute"
4284920,4285300," the same"
4285300,4285560," shit"
4285560,4286040," over and"
4286040,4286520," over again"
4286520,4287460," but then"
4287460,4287860," you start"
4287860,4288380," to cache"
4288380,4288680," them"
4288680,4289300," and the"
4289300,4289660," cache"
4289660,4290240," basically"
4290240,4291560," turns into"
4291560,4292080," a table"
4292080,4292440," that you"
4292440,4293000," can compute"
4293000,4293600," without"
4293600,4294280," recursion"
4294280,4295560," right"
4295560,4296300," so the"
4296300,4296740," class of"
4296740,4297100," this kind"
4297100,4297480," of problems"
4297480,4299080," can be solved"
4299080,4299660," like that"
4299660,4300640," these are"
4300640,4301340," dynamic programming"
4301340,4301860," problems"
4301860,4302820," essentially"
4302820,4305220," right"
4305220,4306080," so"
4306080,4306540," and there's"
4306540,4306800," a whole"
4306800,4307220," class of"
4307220,4307360," it"
4307360,4307820," like there's"
4307820,4308120," a lot of"
4308120,4308540," interesting"
4308540,4309040," problems"
4309040,4309440," that are"
4309440,4309820," solved"
4309820,4310420," like that"
4310420,4311360," and they're"
4311360,4312020," actually quite"
4312020,4312400," diverse"
4312400,4312920," problems"
4312920,4313200," right"
4313200,4313700," so they're"
4313700,4314100," very diverse"
4314100,4314480," problems"
4314480,4315020," as you"
4315020,4315020," as you"
4315020,4315420," can see"
4315420,4315940," sometimes"
4315940,4316700," they involve"
4316700,4317060," even"
4317060,4317680," integrals"
4317680,4319120," of all"
4319120,4319540," things"
4319540,4320340," of course"
4320340,4320840," to scare"
4320840,4321040," away"
4321040,4321480," people"
4321480,4322420," um"
4322420,4325720," programming"
4325720,4326220," is not"
4326220,4326800," encoding"
4326800,4327700," what is"
4327700,4328000," coding"
4328000,4328380," and what's"
4328380,4328880," the difference"
4328880,4329600," between coding"
4329600,4330220," and programming"
4330220,4330740," i have no"
4330740,4331080," idea"
4331080,4338760," all right"
4338760,4341260," so there"
4341260,4341500," is a"
4341500,4341820," nirk"
4341820,4342240," if"
4342240,4342600," more"
4342600,4343300," is it"
4343300,4343460," in"
4343460,4343880," russian"
4343880,4344520," so if"
4344520,4344720," more"
4344720,4345140," you"
4345140,4345940," right"
4345940,4352620," yeah"
4352620,4353100," probably"
4353100,4353700," i mean"
4353700,4354000," so it's"
4354000,4354260," all in"
4354260,4354580," russian"
4354580,4355080," like"
4355080,4355620," come"
4355620,4356960," this is"
4356960,4357400," an english"
4357400,4357780," speaking"
4357780,4358320," stream"
4358320,4360840," all right"
4360840,4361540," not everyone"
4361540,4362640," speaks russian"
4362640,4363040," here"
4363040,4366680," what if"
4366680,4367100," the language"
4367100,4367660," had support"
4367660,4368260," for tail call"
4368260,4368900," optimizations"
4368900,4370560," i don't think"
4370560,4371240," it would be"
4371240,4372100," possible to"
4372100,4372800," actually do"
4372800,4373320," that because"
4373320,4373760," of this"
4373760,4374100," thing"
4374100,4374760," i already"
4374760,4375380," removed"
4375380,4375900," recursive"
4375900,4376320," version"
4376320,4377920," but recursive"
4377920,4378180," version"
4378180,4378640," actually"
4378640,4380500," did several"
4380500,4381240," branching"
4381240,4381580," calls"
4381580,4382800," right"
4382800,4383680," so when"
4383680,4383960," you have"
4383960,4384520," a recursive"
4384520,4385140," recursion"
4385140,4385440," that is"
4385440,4385760," also"
4385760,4386860," sort of"
4386860,4387700," branching"
4387700,4388520," and turns"
4388520,4389220," into a"
4389220,4389600," tree"
4389600,4390760," you can't"
4390760,4391440," apply"
4391440,4391940," tail call"
4391940,4392460," optimizations"
4392460,4392940," on such"
4392940,4393420," recursive"
4393420,4393820," functions"
4393820,4394860," right"
4394860,4395740," you can only"
4395740,4396120," apply"
4396120,4396640," tail call"
4396640,4397500," optimization"
4397500,4398080," when"
4398080,4399380," the call"
4399380,4400080," forms"
4400080,4400720," into a"
4400720,4401000," loop"
4401000,4401720," right"
4401720,4402120," when it's"
4402120,4402340," like"
4402340,4403240," you know"
4403240,4404720," just a"
4404720,4405040," single"
4405040,4405440," loop"
4405440,4405780," without"
4405780,4406060," any"
4406060,4406480," branching"
4406480,4406880," so you"
4406880,4407100," just"
4407100,4407320," can't"
4407320,4407440," do"
4407440,4407660," that"
4407660,4409700," so by"
4409700,4410040," dynamic"
4410040,4410460," i don't"
4410460,4410860," know what"
4410860,4411180," they mean"
4411180,4411740," by dynamic"
4411740,4412080," by the"
4412080,4412280," way"
4412280,4412960," right"
4412960,4413400," so people"
4413400,4413900," are curious"
4413900,4414360," why it"
4414360,4414640," is called"
4414640,4414960," dynamic"
4414960,4415300," programming"
4415300,4415880," don't ask"
4415880,4416080," me"
4416080,4416460," i have"
4416460,4417060," no idea"
4417060,4418340," right"
4418340,4419320," so ask"
4419320,4419900," chat gpt"
4419900,4420280," so they"
4420280,4420520," probably"
4420520,4420760," know"
4420760,4426060," dynamic"
4426060,4426620," is a terrible"
4426620,4426820," name"
4426820,4427320," yeah it is"
4427320,4428240," it is absolutely"
4428240,4428860," terrible name"
4428860,4429480," but this is what"
4429480,4430100," they decided to"
4430100,4430600," call it for"
4430600,4431100," gatekeeping"
4431100,4432020," purposes"
4432020,4432580," probably for"
4432580,4432960," the same"
4432960,4434220," purpose"
4434220,4434960," they put"
4434960,4436040," in integrals"
4436040,4436780," into wikipedia"
4436780,4437520," article about"
4437520,4438280," dynamic programming"
4438280,4439180," right"
4439180,4439180," right"
4439180,4440340," so those"
4440340,4440720," goddamn"
4440720,4441660," gatekeepers"
4441660,4443180," anyway"
4443180,4445440," anyway"
4445440,4445940," anyway"
4445940,4445960," anyway"
4445960,4446260," anyway"
4446260,4451880," all right"
4451880,4452220," so what do"
4452220,4452540," we have"
4452540,4453780," so we have"
4453780,4454160," something like"
4454160,4454360," this"
4454360,4455840," it's cool"
4455840,4456200," and all"
4456200,4457440," but as i"
4457440,4458140," already said"
4458140,4460360," we are"
4460360,4461300," only getting"
4461300,4462960," the amount"
4462960,4463620," of"
4463620,4465260," actions"
4465260,4466460," that you"
4466460,4466700," need to"
4466700,4467040," perform"
4467040,4467400," on a"
4467400,4467720," string"
4467720,4468700," but we"
4468700,4469400," don't get"
4469400,4470320," the specific"
4470320,4471040," actions"
4471040,4472100," right"
4472100,4473020," we don't"
4473020,4473840," we can't have"
4473840,4474700," a list of"
4474700,4475740," okay you have"
4475740,4476460," initial string"
4476460,4477920," at that index"
4477920,4479320," insert this"
4479320,4479800," character"
4479800,4481440," remove that"
4481440,4482120," character from"
4482120,4482820," that index"
4482820,4483580," and so on"
4483580,4484160," and so forth"
4484160,4485800," how can we"
4485800,4486480," transform"
4486480,4487540," this entire"
4487540,4487980," thing"
4487980,4489260," into an"
4489260,4489740," algorithm"
4489740,4490540," that spits"
4490540,4491260," out a"
4491260,4491680," list"
4491680,4493100," of such"
4493100,4493480," things"
4493480,4494540," right"
4494540,4495420," what's"
4495420,4495660," interesting"
4495660,4496020," is that"
4496020,4496520," at any"
4496520,4497140," given time"
4497140,4497560," as already"
4497560,4497920," said"
4497920,4498780," we know"
4498780,4499720," what kind"
4499720,4500180," of action"
4500180,4500800," we perform"
4500800,4501400," we know"
4501400,4502920," what describes"
4502920,4503420," a certain"
4503420,4503800," action"
4503800,4504260," so we know"
4504260,4504600," what this"
4504600,4505240," thing basically"
4505240,4505780," describes"
4505780,4506960," ignoring the"
4506960,4507360," current"
4507360,4507980," character"
4507980,4508600," and leaving"
4508600,4509160," it as"
4509160,4509480," it is"
4509480,4510220," we know"
4510220,4510560," that"
4510560,4511760," trying to"
4511760,4512000," check"
4512000,4512480," this"
4512480,4513240," thing"
4513240,4513560," means"
4513560,4514260," that"
4514260,4514740," we're"
4514740,4515420," checking"
4515420,4515720," whether"
4515720,4516020," it's"
4516020,4516380," possible"
4516380,4516720," to"
4516720,4517020," remove"
4517020,4517240," this"
4517240,4517500," thing"
4517500,4518060," we know"
4518060,4518220," that"
4518220,4518440," this"
4518440,4518620," is"
4518620,4519040," addition"
4519040,4519320," and"
4519320,4519480," this"
4519480,4519600," is"
4519600,4520040," replacement"
4520040,4521540," so we"
4521540,4521900," kind of"
4521900,4522300," know"
4522300,4523220," so that"
4523220,4523580," means we"
4523580,4524400," can modify"
4524400,4524800," that"
4524800,4525380," to know"
4525380,4525640," these"
4525640,4526020," specific"
4526020,4526560," actions"
4526560,4527740," so what"
4527740,4527900," I'm"
4527900,4528140," thinking"
4528140,4528600," is that"
4528600,4529640," I have"
4529640,4530160," this idea"
4530160,4530740," what if"
4530740,4531280," we also"
4531280,4531980," keep track"
4531980,4532860," a table"
4532860,4533920," of actions"
4533920,4535020," that would"
4535020,4535560," perform"
4535560,4536200," at each"
4536200,4536420," an"
4536420,4536880," individual"
4536880,4537440," pair"
4537440,4537860," of"
4537860,4538660," you know"
4538660,4539020," lengths"
4539020,4539460," of the"
4539460,4539840," strings"
4539840,4540820," right"
4540820,4541600," on top of"
4541600,4542360," like storing"
4542360,4543440," the amount"
4543440,4543940," of actions"
4543940,4544500," we also"
4544500,4545400," will store"
4545400,4546160," the current"
4546160,4546800," action that"
4546800,4547400," we performed"
4547400,4547840," in there"
4547840,4549600," we'll give it"
4549600,4549840," a try"
4549840,4550160," I think"
4550160,4550640," it's kind"
4550640,4551000," of interesting"
4551000,4551360," actually"
4551360,4552600," so this"
4552600,4552900," is the"
4552900,4553300," cache"
4553300,4554020," and let's"
4554020,4554520," actually do"
4554520,4554980," something like"
4554980,4555460," actions"
4555460,4556080," right"
4556080,4556920," and let's"
4556920,4557480," initialize"
4557480,4558100," the actions"
4558100,4559620," and it's"
4559620,4559880," going to be"
4559880,4560460," something like"
4560460,4561800," none"
4561800,4563760," right"
4563760,4564080," and it's"
4564080,4564380," going to be"
4564380,4564780," length"
4564780,4567960," s2"
4567960,4568660," plus 1"
4568660,4569820," and so"
4569820,4570420," when we're"
4570420,4571140," tracing this"
4571140,4571900," entire stuff"
4571900,4572360," I think"
4572360,4572620," we're going"
4572620,4573100," to trace"
4573100,4573720," them together"
4573720,4574900," right"
4574900,4575340," so this"
4575340,4575580," is going"
4575580,4575780," to be"
4575780,4576360," actions"
4576360,4578580," actions"
4578580,4579320," where is"
4579320,4579640," another"
4579640,4580180," trace"
4580180,4580580," cache"
4580580,4581080," this is"
4581080,4581620," actions"
4581620,4582360," and this"
4582360,4582660," is"
4582660,4583260," actions"
4583260,4583980," as well"
4583980,4587540," right"
4587540,4588040," all right"
4588040,4588400," all right"
4588400,4588880," so when"
4588880,4589420," we trace"
4589420,4590020," this thing"
4590020,4591360," actions"
4591360,4592400," so by"
4592400,4592560," the way"
4592560,4592860," this is"
4592860,4593220," why I"
4593220,4593560," wanted to"
4593560,4593700," put"
4593700,4594200," variatics"
4594200,4594600," in here"
4594600,4595020," so when"
4595020,4595440," I disable"
4595440,4595720," it I"
4595720,4596080," don't have"
4596080,4596360," to like"
4596360,4596980," synchronize"
4596980,4597560," the signatures"
4597560,4597980," of these"
4597980,4598260," things"
4598260,4598540," right"
4598540,4598860," so I"
4598860,4599160," don't have"
4599160,4599520," to care"
4599520,4600520," about that"
4600520,4600840," I'm sure"
4600840,4601620," if it's"
4601620,4602160," important"
4602160,4603040," but yeah"
4603040,4603260," whatever"
4603260,4604700," okay"
4604700,4605340," so what"
4605340,4605580," we can"
4605580,4605840," do in"
4605840,4606080," here"
4606080,4606420," we're"
4606420,4607040," iterating"
4607040,4607580," rows"
4607580,4608220," and columns"
4608220,4608980," and blah"
4608980,4609140," blah"
4609140,4609360," blah"
4609360,4610420," and"
4610420,4610940," fortunately"
4610940,4611540," it's not"
4611540,4612120," particularly"
4612120,4613200," convenient"
4613200,4616820," because I"
4616820,4617220," want to be"
4617220,4617740," able to"
4617740,4618140," iterate"
4618140,4618820," through"
4618820,4619480," like"
4619480,4620120," actual"
4620120,4620740," indices"
4620740,4621340," in here"
4621360,4622080," so maybe"
4622080,4623560," what I"
4623560,4623920," have to"
4623920,4624120," do"
4624120,4624400," I have"
4624400,4624700," to do"
4624700,4625300," a range"
4625300,4626260," of length"
4626260,4627440," of this"
4627440,4627820," stuff"
4627820,4628740," is that"
4628740,4628980," a good"
4628980,4629320," idea"
4629320,4629780," I don't"
4629780,4630020," know"
4630020,4631560," so then"
4631560,4632180," later"
4632180,4632960," I can"
4632960,4633300," do"
4633300,4633720," something"
4633720,4634000," like"
4634000,4634520," length"
4634520,4635340," of the"
4635340,4637860," cache"
4637860,4638420," row"
4638420,4639380," right"
4639380,4639860," so this"
4639860,4640120," is a"
4640120,4640400," cache"
4640400,4640740," row"
4640740,4641180," and that"
4641180,4641600," gives me"
4641600,4642080," a column"
4642080,4642600," so then"
4642600,4642900," later"
4642900,4643260," I can"
4643260,4643420," do"
4643420,4643860," item"
4643860,4644840," cache"
4644840,4645460," row"
4645460,4646620," and"
4646620,4647080," column"
4647080,4648040," right"
4648040,4648540," but then"
4648540,4648880," I can"
4648880,4649260," have a"
4649260,4649620," specific"
4649620,4650180," action"
4650740,4651800," right"
4651800,4652140," because"
4652140,4652500," these"
4652500,4652720," are"
4652720,4653160," two"
4653160,4653920," dimensional"
4653920,4654440," parallel"
4654440,4654900," arrays"
4654900,4655260," aren't"
4655260,4655480," they"
4655480,4656360," I think"
4656360,4656520," they"
4656520,4656860," are"
4656860,4658140," right"
4658140,4658400," and in"
4658400,4658660," here"
4658660,4659320," right"
4659320,4659720," if all"
4659720,4660200," that stuff"
4660200,4660720," is none"
4660720,4661180," it's gonna"
4661180,4661460," be like"
4661460,4661700," that"
4661700,4662120," but if"
4662120,4662360," it's"
4662360,4662660," not"
4662660,4665760," what we"
4665760,4666080," want to"
4666080,4666360," do"
4666360,4667140," is probably"
4667140,4667700," have"
4667700,4668840," maybe"
4668840,4669200," f"
4669200,4669780," string"
4669780,4670400," right"
4670400,4670860," what about"
4670860,4671440," we do"
4671440,4672600," f"
4672600,4673060," string"
4673060,4673880," where we"
4673880,4674240," just put"
4674240,4674700," an item"
4674700,4675180," here"
4675180,4676720," and"
4676720,4677160," also"
4677160,4677620," here"
4677620,4678300," an"
4678300,4678840," action"
4678840,4679180," in"
4679180,4679820," parentheses"
4679820,4680540," right"
4680540,4681060," so this"
4681060,4681320," is gonna"
4681320,4681660," be an"
4681660,4681980," action"
4681980,4682200," in"
4682200,4682600," parentheses"
4682600,4683500," and let's"
4683500,4683820," say that"
4683820,4684360," the width"
4684360,4684740," in this"
4684740,4685300," specific case"
4685300,4685560," is gonna"
4685560,4685940," be like"
4685940,4686460," five"
4686460,4687680," right"
4687680,4688040," let's go"
4688040,4688420," back to"
4688420,4688600," this"
4688600,4689060," example"
4689060,4689560," right"
4689560,4689900," let's go"
4689900,4690220," back to"
4690220,4690380," this"
4690380,4690760," example"
4690760,4692120," and that"
4692120,4692660," should be"
4692660,4693200," fine"
4693200,4693720," though"
4693720,4694340," for the"
4694340,4694740," action"
4694740,4696120," so what's"
4696120,4696320," gonna be"
4696320,4696660," the type"
4696660,4696900," of the"
4696900,4697260," action"
4697260,4698800," I think"
4698800,4699080," I wanna"
4699080,4700640," actually"
4700640,4703580," so"
4703580,4704600," ignore"
4704600,4705300," I want"
4705300,4705540," the"
4705540,4706020," action"
4706020,4706400," ignore"
4706400,4706820," to be"
4706820,4707080," maybe"
4707080,4707580," a single"
4707580,4707960," character"
4707960,4708360," I"
4708360,4708960," right"
4708960,4709440," so what"
4709440,4709680," other"
4709680,4710040," actions"
4710040,4710300," do we"
4710300,4710460," have"
4710460,4710700," we have"
4710700,4711040," add"
4711040,4712640," remove"
4712640,4713180," and"
4713180,4714240," replace"
4714240,4714860," right"
4714860,4715960," so we're"
4715960,4716380," gonna have"
4716380,4717220," A"
4717220,4717920," right"
4717920,4718340," because I"
4718340,4718840," need to"
4718840,4719320," print this"
4719320,4719900," entire thing"
4719900,4720240," right"
4720240,4720580," I need to"
4720580,4720980," print this"
4720980,4721420," entire thing"
4721420,4721880," so I need"
4721880,4722140," to"
4722140,4722740," like a"
4722740,4723380," compact way"
4723380,4723940," to represent"
4723940,4724440," this kind"
4724440,4724740," of stuff"
4724740,4725120," so the"
4725120,4725360," remove"
4725360,4725620," is gonna"
4725620,4726040," be R"
4726040,4726960," and"
4726960,4728800," replace"
4728800,4729240," is already"
4729240,4729680," taken"
4729680,4730320," like R"
4730320,4730720," is already"
4730720,4731080," taken"
4731080,4731580," so maybe"
4731580,4732400," what if we"
4732400,4732700," call it"
4732700,4733080," S"
4733080,4734620," right"
4734620,4735320," so for"
4735320,4735780," substitute"
4735780,4736780," substitute"
4736780,4738560," right"
4738560,4739200," so maybe"
4739200,4739880," subst"
4739880,4741760," so there"
4741760,4742080," we go"
4742080,4743060," so"
4743060,4744140," ignore"
4744140,4744760," add"
4744760,4745280," remove"
4745280,4746040," and substitute"
4746040,4746660," okay"
4746660,4750320," cool"
4750320,4750800," cool"
4750800,4751160," cool"
4751160,4751480," cool"
4751480,4752300," so and"
4752300,4753100," when the"
4753100,4753740," action is not"
4753740,4754380," initialized"
4754380,4755180," we can say"
4755180,4755620," that maybe"
4755620,4756120," it has to"
4756120,4756520," be something"
4756520,4756860," like"
4756860,4757640," you know"
4757640,4758060," dash"
4758060,4758500," right"
4758500,4759540," so it's"
4759540,4759920," going to"
4759920,4760480," be simply"
4760480,4760900," dash"
4760900,4765900," maybe"
4765900,4766800," this thing"
4766800,4767480," can be also"
4767480,4768500," like a dash"
4768500,4768980," as well"
4768980,4769920," right"
4769920,4770440," and maybe"
4770440,4771080," that will"
4771080,4771660," mean that"
4771660,4772120," I can get"
4772120,4772720," rid of"
4772720,4773380," this thing"
4773380,4774500," because"
4774500,4775120," yeah"
4775120,4775600," that's actually"
4775600,4776180," pretty cool"
4776180,4776600," yeah"
4776600,4777000," I can"
4777000,4777540," get rid"
4777540,4777840," of this"
4777840,4778140," shit"
4778140,4779940," aha"
4779940,4781780," that is"
4781780,4782500," very useful"
4782500,4783340," I think"
4783340,4784060," I don't"
4784060,4784560," think so"
4784560,4789320," all right"
4789320,4790960," so when"
4790960,4791520," we're tracing"
4791520,4792060," we're providing"
4792060,4792580," the action"
4792580,4792940," okay"
4792940,4793560," so now"
4793560,4794140," let me try"
4794140,4794640," this entire"
4794640,4794960," thing"
4794960,4795560," it doesn't"
4795560,4796100," do anything"
4796100,4796740," because we"
4796740,4797400," disabled the"
4797400,4797800," tracing"
4797800,4798680," let's enable"
4798680,4799520," the tracing"
4799520,4801560," int object"
4801560,4802000," is not"
4802000,4802560," iterable"
4802560,4803180," right"
4803180,4803820," which is"
4803820,4804700," kind of"
4804700,4805160," understandable"
4805160,4805680," but not"
4805680,4805940," really"
4805940,4807060," because it"
4807060,4807520," has to be"
4807520,4807980," arranged"
4807980,4808720," of course"
4808720,4810880," okay"
4810880,4811240," cool"
4811240,4811820," all right"
4811820,4812120," so as you"
4812120,4812340," can see"
4812340,4812720," the cache"
4812720,4813320," is populated"
4813320,4814200," except we"
4814200,4814940," don't keep"
4814940,4815380," track of"
4815380,4815840," the actions"
4815840,4816220," so the"
4816220,4816660," actions are"
4816660,4817120," supposed to"
4817120,4817420," be in"
4817420,4817800," parentheses"
4817800,4818220," right"
4818220,4820020," right"
4820020,4821020," so they're"
4821020,4821400," supposed to"
4821400,4821700," be in"
4821700,4822060," parentheses"
4822060,4822780," so let's"
4822780,4823500," actually put"
4823500,4824740," something in"
4824740,4825220," parentheses"
4825220,4825800," as well"
4825800,4826220," in here"
4826220,4827340," okay"
4827340,4827960," so"
4827960,4829160," effectively"
4829160,4831320," when"
4831320,4832980," n1"
4832980,4834140," is equal"
4834140,4834640," to 0"
4834640,4835600," right"
4835600,4840220," n1"
4840220,4840780," is equal"
4840780,4841320," to 0"
4841320,4843160," that means"
4843160,4843940," we are"
4843940,4844640," adding"
4844640,4845980," new characters"
4845980,4847160," to reach"
4847160,4847740," s2"
4847740,4848200," right"
4848200,4849380," so that"
4849380,4849660," means we"
4849660,4849900," have to"
4849900,4850480," do actions"
4850480,4851080," n1"
4851080,4851420," and"
4851420,4852420," 2"
4852420,4853220," and the"
4853220,4853540," action"
4853540,4854200," is at"
4854200,4854840," right"
4854840,4855380," so we'll"
4855380,4855760," just do"
4855760,4856240," the add"
4856240,4857520," so let's"
4857520,4857840," see how"
4857840,4858220," it goes"
4858220,4858440," right"
4858440,4858880," so for"
4858880,4859480," the row"
4859480,4860140," is adding"
4860140,4860640," right"
4860640,4861100," so this"
4861100,4861580," is add"
4861580,4863080," interestingly"
4863080,4864580," so"
4864580,4866280," when"
4866280,4867000," we are"
4867000,4867480," at 0"
4867480,4867800," 0"
4867800,4868340," we're not"
4868340,4868860," really adding"
4868860,4869360," anything"
4869360,4869640," right"
4869640,4870420," so if"
4870420,4870720," you have"
4870720,4870900," two"
4870900,4871360," strings"
4871360,4873340," empty"
4873340,4873760," string"
4873760,4874440," and empty"
4874440,4874780," string"
4874780,4875580," what's the"
4875580,4876000," Levenstein"
4876000,4876680," distance between"
4876680,4877380," empty string"
4877380,4877960," and an empty"
4877960,4878320," string"
4878320,4879420," right"
4879420,4879900," it's just"
4879900,4880340," 0"
4880340,4880940," and what"
4880940,4881480," action do"
4881480,4881960," you perform"
4881960,4882760," to get"
4882760,4883020," there"
4883020,4884000," you don't"
4884000,4884400," really do"
4884400,4884780," anything"
4884780,4885180," so"
4885180,4886380," what I'm"
4886380,4886600," thinking"
4886600,4887120," is that"
4887120,4888260," cache"
4888260,4889200," 0"
4889200,4890040," 0"
4890040,4890540," is of"
4890540,4890800," course"
4890800,4891860," 0"
4891860,4892440," by itself"
4892440,4892860," and the"
4892860,4893140," action"
4893140,4893340," that"
4893340,4893980," perform"
4893980,4894120," at"
4894120,4894320," 0"
4894320,4894640," 0"
4894640,4895540," is"
4895540,4896100," basically"
4896100,4896660," ignore"
4896660,4897440," right"
4897440,4898040," we don't"
4898040,4898480," really do"
4898480,4898820," anything"
4898820,4899320," so it"
4899320,4899600," kind of"
4899600,4899780," makes"
4899780,4900020," sense"
4900020,4900580," to me"
4900580,4901100," right"
4901100,4901520," and because"
4901520,4901880," of that"
4901880,4902660," we shouldn't"
4902660,4903060," probably"
4903060,4903660," attach"
4903660,4905620," right"
4905620,4906200," we shouldn't"
4906200,4906460," probably"
4906460,4906980," attach"
4906980,4907520," the"
4907520,4908180," like"
4908180,4908500," the"
4908500,4908920," left"
4908920,4909360," top"
4909360,4909980," corner"
4909980,4910380," right"
4910380,4910720," so we"
4910720,4911040," probably"
4911040,4911340," want to"
4911340,4911600," iterate"
4911600,4911920," from"
4911920,4912240," 1"
4912240,4913660," by the"
4913660,4913800," way"
4913800,4914360," so here"
4914360,4916440," I want"
4916440,4916780," to move"
4916780,4917320," this entire"
4917320,4917760," stuff in"
4917760,4918000," here"
4918000,4922060," okay"
4922060,4923400," so as you"
4923400,4923740," can see"
4923740,4924120," this is"
4924120,4924400," 0"
4924400,4924820," right"
4924820,4925260," and we"
4925260,4925560," ignore"
4925560,4925820," here"
4925820,4926160," but for"
4926160,4926360," this"
4926360,4926560," thing"
4926560,4926880," we are"
4926880,4927220," adding"
4927220,4927840," so"
4927840,4928440," but here"
4928440,4929600," if"
4929600,4930800," n0"
4930800,4931560," and n2"
4931560,4932080," is 0"
4932080,4933160," and n1"
4933160,4933580," is bigger"
4933580,4933980," than 0"
4933980,4934340," that means"
4934340,4934640," we need"
4934640,4935060," to remove"
4935060,4935560," the characters"
4935560,4935940," to get"
4935940,4936200," to the"
4936200,4936420," second"
4936420,4936760," string"
4936760,4937380," so that"
4937380,4937540," means"
4937540,4937740," the"
4937740,4938140," action"
4938140,4939080," for the"
4939080,4939400," second"
4939400,4940160," initialization"
4940160,4940560," in here"
4940560,4941500," is remove"
4941500,4942520," right"
4942520,4943560," it is"
4943560,4944080," removed"
4944080,4945120," so let's"
4945120,4945320," actually"
4945320,4945840," take a look"
4945840,4946320," yes"
4946320,4946760," you see"
4946760,4947180," we're keeping"
4947180,4947440," track"
4947440,4948040," so here's"
4948040,4948640," here's"
4948640,4948900," ignore"
4948900,4949320," here's"
4949320,4949540," add"
4949540,4949960," and here"
4949960,4950500," we're just"
4950500,4950880," removing"
4950880,4951320," things"
4951320,4952900," and the"
4952900,4953420," specific"
4953420,4953920," actions"
4953920,4954880," in this"
4954880,4955260," window"
4955260,4955600," are going"
4955600,4956000," to depend"
4956000,4956420," on what"
4956420,4957000," exactly"
4957000,4957900," we do"
4957900,4958420," in here"
4958420,4958820," right"
4958820,4959420," for instance"
4959420,4959880," here we"
4959880,4960160," ignore"
4960160,4960620," the things"
4960620,4961360," that means"
4961360,4961800," we have"
4961800,4962220," to do"
4962220,4963640," action"
4963640,4964380," n1"
4964380,4965800," n2"
4965800,4968040," ignore"
4968040,4969820," and this"
4969820,4970080," one"
4970080,4970720," is really"
4970720,4971260," interesting"
4971260,4972160," this one"
4972160,4972480," is really"
4972480,4972880," interesting"
4972880,4973760," so what"
4973760,4974180," we have"
4974180,4974600," to do"
4974600,4976000," is get"
4976000,4976680," rid of"
4976680,4977340," the mean"
4977340,4978400," function"
4978400,4979540," because it"
4979540,4979980," kind of"
4979980,4980680," obscures"
4980680,4982320," what exactly"
4982320,4983220," the action"
4983220,4984480," we took"
4984480,4985700," or performed"
4985700,4986160," I don't know"
4986160,4986960," what would be"
4986960,4987600," the perfect"
4987600,4988220," verb in this"
4988220,4988800," particular case"
4988800,4989580," so essentially"
4989580,4990780," the loss"
4990780,4991680," of information"
4991680,4992660," about specific"
4992660,4993240," action"
4993240,4993720," in this"
4993720,4994180," algorithm"
4994180,4994980," happens"
4994980,4995640," precisely"
4995640,4996320," in here"
4996320,4997500," like this"
4997500,4998380," is precisely"
4998380,4999000," the place"
4999000,4999780," we pinpointed"
4999780,5000100," the place"
5000100,5000640," where we"
5000640,5000980," lose"
5000980,5001680," information"
5001680,5002680," about"
5002680,5003360," specific"
5003360,5003920," actions"
5003920,5004580," because as"
5004580,5004920," you can see"
5004920,5005440," here we just"
5005440,5005840," pick the"
5005840,5006800," smallest one"
5006800,5007200," and we"
5007200,5007500," ignore"
5007500,5007820," everything"
5007820,5008120," else"
5008120,5009280," we should"
5009280,5009660," get rid"
5009660,5010080," of that"
5010080,5011880," right"
5011880,5012180," we should"
5012180,5012460," get rid"
5012460,5012780," of that"
5012780,5013740," so let's"
5013740,5014120," assume"
5014120,5015300," that at"
5015300,5015720," the beginning"
5015720,5016840," right"
5016840,5017340," we just"
5017340,5017940," set the"
5017940,5018320," current"
5018320,5018900," cache"
5018900,5019340," the current"
5019340,5019800," value of"
5019800,5020220," the cache"
5020220,5023060," basically"
5023060,5023640," to the"
5023640,5024040," left"
5024040,5024740," right"
5024740,5025360," or actually"
5025360,5025840," to the"
5025840,5027020," to the"
5027020,5027580," upper one"
5027580,5028860," effectively"
5028860,5029520," removing the"
5029520,5029880," character"
5029880,5030660," right"
5030660,5033200," effectively"
5033200,5033820," removing the"
5033820,5034080," character"
5034080,5035000," which means"
5035000,5035360," that the"
5035360,5035760," action"
5035760,5037060," and one"
5037060,5038860," and"
5038860,5039540," and two"
5039540,5040640," is remove"
5040640,5041800," right"
5041800,5043160," so the next"
5043160,5043520," thing we"
5043520,5044020," want to do"
5044020,5044900," we want to"
5044900,5045660," take the"
5045660,5046140," thing"
5046140,5046940," associated"
5046940,5047460," with"
5047460,5047800," the"
5047800,5049640," with"
5049640,5050100," add"
5050100,5051240," and maybe"
5051240,5051820," compare it"
5051820,5052200," with the"
5052200,5052540," current"
5052540,5052940," cache"
5052940,5054100," so maybe"
5054100,5054500," it would"
5054500,5055300," be a"
5055300,5055660," little bit"
5055660,5056040," easier"
5056040,5056620," if we"
5056620,5057200," saved"
5057200,5057780," all these"
5057780,5058180," values"
5058180,5059080," to separate"
5059080,5059920," like variables"
5059920,5060440," so it's a"
5060440,5060700," little bit"
5060700,5061180," easier to"
5061180,5061600," see what's"
5061600,5062200," going on"
5062200,5064560," right"
5064560,5065020," so this"
5065020,5065280," is going"
5065280,5065520," to be"
5065520,5065860," add"
5065860,5067320," this is"
5067320,5067480," going"
5067480,5067780," to be"
5067780,5071340," remove"
5071340,5075500," it's"
5075500,5075760," going to"
5075760,5076120," remove"
5076120,5076640," and this"
5076640,5076920," is going"
5076920,5077260," to be"
5077260,5078040," substitute"
5078040,5078980," subst"
5078980,5086840," all right"
5086840,5087940," so initially"
5087940,5088700," we put"
5088700,5092120," this is"
5092120,5092700," supposed to"
5092700,5093280," be remove"
5093280,5094620," right"
5094620,5095180," add"
5095180,5096180," let me"
5096180,5096780," double check"
5096780,5097740," that we"
5097740,5098600," if we can"
5098600,5099160," achieve this"
5099160,5099500," thing from"
5099500,5100060," this thing"
5100060,5100460," that means"
5100460,5100920," we removed"
5100920,5101100," it"
5101100,5101300," okay"
5101300,5101700," so that"
5101700,5102180," makes sense"
5102180,5103240," remove"
5103240,5103820," add"
5103820,5104620," substitute"
5104620,5106560," so we"
5106560,5107280," set the"
5107280,5107680," cache"
5107680,5108480," to remove"
5108480,5108940," value"
5108940,5109560," and we"
5109560,5110080," set the"
5110080,5110480," action"
5110480,5111120," to remove"
5111120,5112000," now"
5112000,5113200," if"
5113200,5113960," the"
5113960,5114320," current"
5114320,5114780," value"
5114780,5118080," is"
5118080,5119240," bigger"
5119240,5119740," than"
5119740,5120160," add"
5120160,5120940," that"
5120940,5121420," means"
5121420,5121720," we"
5121720,5122260," actually"
5122260,5122700," want to"
5122700,5123080," perform"
5123080,5123300," the"
5123300,5123640," add"
5123640,5124160," action"
5124160,5125120," so we"
5125120,5125660," have to"
5125660,5126440," do the"
5126440,5126720," following"
5126720,5127160," thing"
5127160,5127700," we"
5127700,5128040," have to"
5128040,5128380," reset"
5128380,5128560," the"
5128560,5128820," cache"
5128820,5129020," to"
5129020,5129320," add"
5129320,5129900," and"
5129900,5130360," action"
5130360,5130640," to"
5130640,5131060," add"
5131060,5132460," but"
5132460,5132800," then"
5132800,5133220," we"
5133220,5133600," found"
5133600,5133960," out"
5133960,5134740," that"
5134740,5135160," even"
5135160,5135840," smaller"
5135840,5136800," would be"
5136800,5137280," if we"
5137280,5137760," try to"
5137760,5138300," substitute"
5138300,5139320," right"
5139320,5140140," so we"
5140140,5140640," change it"
5140640,5141020," back to"
5141020,5141500," substitute"
5141500,5142440," and we"
5142440,5142760," set the"
5142760,5143080," action"
5143080,5143320," to"
5143320,5143820," substitute"
5143820,5144600," right"
5144600,5145420," and after"
5145420,5145780," all of"
5145780,5146140," that we"
5146140,5146580," should not"
5146580,5147060," forget"
5147060,5147580," to"
5147580,5148480," increment"
5148480,5149300," the"
5149300,5149560," cache"
5149560,5149760," by"
5149760,5150100," one"
5150100,5150360," right"
5150360,5150620," because"
5150620,5151300," we"
5151300,5151660," don't"
5151660,5152000," account"
5152000,5152180," for"
5152180,5152340," the"
5152340,5152680," action"
5152680,5152880," that"
5152880,5153020," we"
5153020,5153180," just"
5153180,5153600," performed"
5153600,5155100," and"
5155100,5156020," that's"
5156020,5156620," basically"
5156620,5157100," where"
5157100,5157460," we"
5157460,5158120," restore"
5158120,5158420," the"
5158420,5158680," lost"
5158680,5159200," information"
5159200,5159540," about"
5159540,5160020," specific"
5160020,5160500," action"
5160500,5160840," we"
5160840,5161960," performed"
5161960,5162600," right"
5162600,5163280," so"
5163280,5163660," specific"
5163660,5164040," action"
5164040,5164240," we"
5164240,5164620," performed"
5164620,5165780," and let's"
5165780,5166080," see if"
5166080,5166480," it actually"
5166480,5166720," does"
5166720,5167000," anything"
5167000,5167600," so I"
5167600,5168000," think"
5168000,5168140," it"
5168140,5168360," does"
5168360,5168600," as you"
5168600,5168720," can"
5168720,5168900," see"
5168900,5169220," these"
5169220,5169440," are"
5169440,5169680," all"
5169680,5169840," the"
5169840,5170180," actions"
5170180,5170360," we"
5170360,5170540," have"
5170540,5170660," in"
5170660,5170880," here"
5170880,5172140," right"
5172140,5172440," so"
5172440,5172740," this"
5172740,5173300," ignore"
5173300,5174500," interestingly"
5174500,5175100," I think"
5175100,5175400," we"
5175400,5176080," forget"
5176080,5176680," one"
5176680,5177260," trace"
5177260,5177840," right"
5177840,5178320," after"
5178320,5178560," we"
5178560,5178840," set"
5178840,5179360," ignore"
5179360,5180580," right"
5180580,5181180," right"
5181180,5181480," after"
5181480,5181680," we"
5181680,5181880," set"
5181880,5182220," ignore"
5182220,5184060," okay"
5184060,5184660," so"
5184660,5185760," now"
5185760,5185980," we"
5185980,5186140," can"
5186140,5186440," see"
5186440,5186800," how"
5186800,5187100," all"
5187100,5187200," of"
5187200,5187320," the"

5187640,5187820," are"
5187820,5188300," populated"
5188300,5188580," so"

5963960,5964480," at the"
5964480,5964960," end"
5964960,5966280," no"
5966280,5969400," I would"
5969400,5970080," understand"
5970080,5970620," this stuff"
5970620,5970920," if we"
5970920,5971380," didn't have"
5971380,5971900," an extra"
5971900,5972320," action"
5972320,5972800," at the"
5972800,5973180," end"
5973180,5974260," because"
5974260,5974740," if it"
5974740,5975360," was just"
5975360,5975720," add"
5975720,5976240," ignore"
5976240,5976620," ignore"
5976620,5977040," ignore"
5977040,5978400," add"
5978400,5979620," that actually"
5979620,5980500," fits perfectly"
5980500,5981060," into"
5981060,5982060," what we"
5982060,5982340," have in"
5982340,5982540," here"
5982540,5982920," so let's"
5982920,5983160," actually"
5983160,5983760," grab"
5983760,5985120," this entire"
5985120,5985520," stuff"
5985520,5986200," right"
5986200,5986960," so if"
5986960,5987240," it was"
5987240,5987720," like that"
5987720,5988240," it makes"
5988240,5988520," perfect"
5988520,5988900," sense"
5988900,5989500," right"
5989500,5989940," because"
5989940,5990640," add"
5990640,5991540," you basically"
5991540,5992120," add at"
5992120,5992560," the beginning"
5992560,5993560," then you"
5993560,5994500," ignore"
5994500,5995100," ignore"
5995100,5995580," ignore"
5995580,5996300," add"
5996300,5997160," right"
5997160,5997560," you ignore"
5997560,5997920," and then"
5997920,5998460," you add"
5998460,5999260," y"
5999260,5999660," so you"
5999660,5999820," would"
5999820,6000160," actually"
6000160,6000480," be able"
6000480,6000820," to"
6000820,6001820," interpret"
6001820,6002340," it as"
6002340,6003100," iterating"
6003100,6004440," the initial"
6004440,6004980," string from"
6004980,6005400," left to"
6005400,6005740," right"
6005740,6006740," like"
6006740,6007500," you know"
6007500,6008080," starting from"
6008080,6008560," the beginning"
6008560,6009020," and then to"
6009020,6009380," the end"
6009380,6010020," and either"
6010020,6010900," ignoring or"
6010900,6011500," adding or"
6011500,6011860," removing"
6011860,6012420," something"
6012420,6013420," right"
6013420,6013420," right"
6013420,6016680," so"
6016680,6020680," but"
6020680,6021160," something"
6021160,6021780," is"
6021780,6022600," going"
6022600,6022960," wrong"
6022960,6023100," in"
6023100,6023320," here"
6023320,6023560," and"
6023560,6023700," I'm"
6023700,6024080," a little"
6024080,6024280," bit"
6024280,6024520," tired"
6024520,6024900," already"
6024900,6025380," so"
6025380,6027020," I'm"
6027020,6027140," not"
6027140,6027380," really"
6027380,6027620," sure"
6027620,6028000," so maybe"
6028000,6028260," I should"
6028260,6028500," make"
6028500,6028840," like a"
6028840,6029060," small"
6029060,6029440," break"
6029440,6037900," let me"
6037900,6038760," let me"
6038760,6039300," think"
6039300,6040520," let me"
6040520,6041060," let me"
6041060,6041500," think"
6041500,6045440," I need"
6045440,6045880," to"
6045880,6047180," grab some"
6047180,6047580," water"
6047580,6048360," right"
6048360,6049100," so just a"
6049100,6049260," second"
6049260,6049840," I'm gonna"
6049840,6050360," go"
6050360,6051040," make a"
6051040,6051380," break"
6051380,6052720," maybe it's"
6052720,6052980," gonna be"
6052980,6053560," like a"
6053560,6054200," let's say"
6054200,6054500," it's gonna be"
6054500,6055040," one minute"
6055040,6055340," right"
6055340,6056080," so just a"
6056080,6056480," small break"
6056480,6056780," because I"
6056780,6056980," need to"
6056980,6057180," grab"
6057180,6057420," some"
6057420,6057640," water"
6057640,6066680," okay"
6066680,6067440," so let"
6067440,6067760," me take"
6067760,6068060," a look"
6068060,6068500," at"
6068500,6068960," the"
6068960,6069480," table"
6069480,6069860," one"
6069860,6070080," more"
6070080,6070520," time"
6070520,6071180," right"
6071180,6073020," so if"
6073020,6073260," it's"
6073260,6073600," add"
6073600,6085520," so I"
6085520,6085940," also have"
6085940,6086220," a feeling"
6086220,6086560," that it"
6086560,6087100," might"
6087100,6087460," be"
6087460,6088420," wrong"
6088420,6089040," when we"
6089040,6089420," have a"
6089420,6089720," different"
6089720,6090140," shape"
6090140,6090760," completely"
6090760,6091640," right"
6091640,6092280," for instance"
6092280,6092780," if I"
6092780,6093180," do"
6093180,6094620," something"
6094620,6094880," like"
6094880,6095200," full"
6095200,6095600," bar"
6095600,6096920," maybe"
6096920,6098220," yeah"
6098220,6098420," let's"
6098420,6098700," actually"
6098700,6099100," try to"
6099100,6099240," do"
6099240,6099440," full"
6099440,6099700," bar"
6099700,6101600," so we"
6101600,6102240," ignore"
6102240,6103620," substitute"
6103620,6104120," substitute"
6104120,6104580," substitute"
6104580,6105320," so does"
6105320,6105940," it always"
6105940,6106520," reach"
6106520,6106940," the"
6106940,6108880," left"
6108880,6109520," corner"
6109520,6111560," does it"
6111560,6112100," always reach"
6112100,6112460," the left"
6112460,6112700," corner"
6112700,6113080," I'm not"
6113080,6113620," really sure"
6113620,6113980," if it"
6113980,6114600," always does"
6114600,6114880," that"
6114880,6115780," so there"
6115780,6116240," is also"
6116240,6117380," situations"
6117380,6118040," when"
6118040,6120540," yeah"
6120540,6121640," one thing"
6121640,6122160," is empty"
6122160,6124040," and we"
6124040,6124680," need to"
6124680,6125520," add additional"
6125520,6125780," stuff"
6125780,6126180," so for"
6126180,6126460," instance"
6126460,6126940," like if we"
6126940,6127340," have something"
6127340,6127700," like this"
6127700,6128040," I think"
6128040,6128320," it's gonna"
6128320,6129620," work"
6129620,6130440," incorrectly"
6130440,6132260," to some"
6132260,6132740," extent"
6132740,6134240," ignore"
6134240,6134760," ignore"
6134760,6137220," so here"
6137220,6137700," we're just"
6137700,6138360," like adding"
6138360,6138980," stuff"
6138980,6140800," and then"
6140800,6141120," ignore"
6141120,6141640," ignore"
6141640,6145460," all right"
6145460,6146100," but let's"
6146100,6146720," go back"
6146720,6147140," to"
6147140,6148480," this thing"
6148480,6155100," the thing"
6155100,6155120," the thing"
6155120,6155500," is that"
6155500,6156120," I don't"
6156120,6156780," understand"
6156780,6157320," is like"
6157320,6158440," what exactly"
6158440,6158880," are we"
6158880,6159380," ignoring"
6159380,6160040," in here"
6160040,6162080," what exactly"
6162080,6162440," are we"
6162440,6162840," ignoring"
6162840,6163380," in here"
6163380,6165420," okay"
6165420,6166300," let me"
6166300,6166700," try"
6166700,6167840," to"
6167840,6168480," append"
6168480,6169140," not only"
6169140,6169800," the action"
6169800,6171140," but also"
6171140,6171940," the"
6171940,6172720," indices"
6172720,6173320," in here"
6173320,6174220," right"
6174220,6175000," also the"
6175000,6175320," indices"
6175320,6175920," in here"
6175920,6179060," okay"
6179060,6180800," let's not"
6180800,6181440," reverse it"
6181440,6181720," right"
6181720,6182080," so I want"
6182080,6182380," to see"
6182380,6182820," all that"
6182820,6183140," stuff"
6183140,6183540," in the"
6183540,6184040," original"
6184040,6185500," form"
6185500,6186420," right"
6186420,6186820," I want"
6186820,6187060," to see"
6187060,6187380," all that"
6187380,6187620," stuff"
6187620,6187900," in the"
6187900,6188200," original"
6188200,6188560," form"
6188560,6189600," how we"
6189600,6189920," traced"
6189920,6190360," all that"
6190360,6190680," back"
6190680,6191620," so it"
6191620,6191980," traces"
6191980,6192420," back"
6192420,6192780," to"
6192780,6193160," 0"
6193160,6193440," 0"
6193440,6193900," anyway"
6193900,6194380," right"
6194380,6194840," both of"
6194840,6195040," them"
6195040,6195460," kind of"
6195460,6195740," trace"
6195740,6196160," back"
6196160,6197640," to"
6197640,6197980," there"
6197980,6200660," okay"
6200660,6203460," so if"
6203460,6204080," we try"
6204080,6204680," to go"
6204680,6204920," in"
6205320,6206200," so that's"
6206200,6206680," totally"
6206680,6207120," fine"
6207120,6208120," it also"
6208120,6208520," traces"
6208520,6209000," back to"
6209000,6209300," here"
6209300,6210340," if we"
6210340,6211200," take a"
6211200,6211500," look at"
6211500,6211820," something"
6211820,6212200," bigger"
6212200,6214300," it sets"
6214300,6214580," a lot"
6214580,6214700," of"
6214700,6215000," tracing"
6215000,6215400," so maybe"
6215400,6215700," I want"
6215700,6216220," to disable"
6216220,6216440," the"
6216440,6216840," tracing"
6216840,6217440," right"
6217440,6217880," so it's"
6217880,6218140," actually"
6218140,6218540," disable"
6218540,6218740," the"
6218740,6219060," tracing"
6219060,6219360," because"
6219360,6219600," it's"
6219600,6219860," kind of"
6219860,6219960," just"
6219960,6220120," like"
6220120,6220320," go"
6220320,6220740," forever"
6220740,6223720," yeah"
6223720,6224260," it always"
6224260,6224660," goes"
6224660,6225060," back"
6225060,6225300," to"
6225300,6225620," 0"
6225620,6226020," 0"
6226020,6227120," right"
6227120,6227360," and"
6227360,6227540," I'm"
6227540,6227900," not"
6227900,6228340," sure"
6228340,6231060," if"
6231060,6232860," this"
6232860,6233160," thing"
6233160,6233400," is"
6233400,6233860," particularly"
6233860,6234460," useful"
6234460,6236200," I'm"
6236200,6236520," not sure"
6236520,6236640," if"
6236640,6236800," this"
6236800,6236980," thing"
6236980,6237100," is"
6237100,6237420," particularly"
6237420,6237740," useful"
6237740,6238660," so"
6238660,6239020," the"
6239020,6239240," thing"
6239240,6239440," that"
6239440,6239840," bothers"
6239840,6240160," me"
6240160,6240660," is"
6240660,6240880," the"
6240880,6241380," case"
6241380,6242140," of"

6672680,6673060," ignore"
6673060,6673380," a"
6673380,6674060," ignore"
6674060,6674400," d"
6674400,6675200," and"
6675200,6675540," substitute"
6675540,6675840," d"
6675840,6676020," with"
6676020,6676300," y"
6676300,6678900," holy"
6678900,6679280," fucking"
6679280,6679560," shit"
6679560,6680140," so now"
6680140,6680720," it's actually"
6680720,6682360," you know why it's so cool"
6682360,6684220," you can then take"
6684220,6685520," this description"
6685520,6687300," of actions"
6687300,6688120," right"
6688120,6689200," and for instance"
6689200,6691080," turn it into animation"
6691080,6691860," right"
6691860,6694600," I think it's kind of cool"
6694600,6694840," right"
6694840,6695900," if you want to make an animation"
6695900,6698040," of how you get from one string"
6698040,6699300," to another one"
6699300,6701120," you can make a log"
6701120,6702700," all right"
6702700,6703580," you can make a log"
6703580,6706300," and then"
6706300,6707980," you"
6707980,6710100," turn it into a sequence"
6710100,6716480," all right"
6716480,6720640," okay"
6720640,6723260," that's pretty cool"
6723260,6727560," all right"
6727560,6728400," that's so so cool"
6728400,6729160," I really like that"
6729160,6730320," and now"
6730320,6731060," right"
6731060,6731440," again"
6731440,6732500," so I keep repeating"
6732500,6733820," this thing over and over again"
6733820,6734000," but"
6734000,6735040," you can now"
6735040,6735520," substitute"
6735520,6736340," strings"
6736340,6737300," characters"
6737300,6738120," with strings"
6738120,6738900," and you basically"
6738900,6739520," have a diff"
6739520,6740500," algorithm"
6740500,6741680," you basically"
6741680,6742220," have a diff"
6742220,6742660," algorithm"
6742660,6743380," isn't it cool"
6743380,6744940," it's so fucking cool"
6744940,6746420," this is so fucking cool"
6746420,6747700," I understand that"
6747700,6748800," I understand like"
6748800,6749980," the algorithm"
6749980,6751280," really well"
6751280,6752100," so to the point"
6752100,6753000," that I can probably"
6753000,6754280," modify it to different"
6754280,6755840," to different"
6755840,6756780," situation"
6756780,6757640," to difference"
6757640,6759060," to different use cases"
6759060,6759940," so to speak"
6759940,6760240," right"
6760240,6762280," to different use cases"
6762280,6763520," so"
6763520,6765760," should I upload that somewhere"
6765760,6766920," should I upload that somewhere"
6766920,6768100," I'm not sure if it's worth"
6768100,6768420," like"
6768420,6769880," an actual"
6769880,6774460," project on github"
6774460,6775140," so maybe I can"
6775140,6776360," put it into a gist"
6776360,6777260," right"
6777260,6778440," so you guys want this gist"
6778440,6779600," to play yourself"
6779600,6779980," I mean"
6779980,6781980," you can actually"
6781980,6782980," like reproduce that"
6782980,6783500," from scratch"
6783500,6784760," because it's purely"
6784760,6785620," educational thing"
6785620,6787280," so it's gonna be"
6787280,6788120," leftpy"
6788120,6789320," and I'm gonna just"
6789320,6789920," put it in here"
6789920,6791180," for anyone who's interested"
6791180,6792860," so it's on the public domain"
6792860,6794980," yeah"
6794980,6798920," create secret gist"
6798920,6799900," I'm not sure if it has"
6799900,6800460," to be secret"
6800460,6800920," so"
6800920,6801640," all right"
6801640,6802520," I'm gonna put that"
6802520,6803560," in the chat"
6803560,6803560," in the chat"
6803560,6805540," and I'm also gonna put that"
6805540,6806640," in the description"
6806640,6807120," right"
6807120,6807820," I'm gonna put that"
6807820,6808600," in the description"
6808600,6810120," so this is a source code"
6810120,6811920," there we go"
6811920,6812320," all right"
6812320,6813040," does anyone have"
6813040,6814540," any questions"
6814540,6815740," does anyone have"
6815740,6816380," any questions"
6816380,6817360," before I go"
6817360,6818560," I think today's stream"
6818560,6819000," was actually"
6819000,6819700," rather productive"
6819700,6820040," right"
6820040,6820820," I learned a lot"
6820820,6823680," I learned a lot"
6823680,6827260," so does anyone have"
6827260,6828920," any entopic questions"
6828920,6830760," any entopic questions"
6830760,6838280," it's pretty good"
6838280,6839040," but it's more of a"
6839040,6839740," proof of concept"
6839740,6840120," right"
6840120,6841580," what did you expect"
6841580,6842000," I mean"
6842000,6843080," did you expect me"
6843080,6843860," to implement"
6843860,6844480," like a whole"
6844480,6845680," freaking product"
6845680,6846280," of something"
6846280,6847100," in two hours"
6847100,6847760," or what"
6847760,6848680," I didn't understand"
6848680,6850180," you're"
6850180,6851880," you have too high"
6851880,6852500," of expectations"
6852500,6852940," of me"
6852940,6859820," could this be"
6859820,6860740," used for bytes"
6860740,6861600," instead of strings"
6861600,6862520," well I mean"
6862520,6867020," probably"
6867020,6869300," this is a wrong"
6869300,6869800," question"
6869800,6871220," this is a completely"
6871220,6872240," incorrect question"
6872240,6872920," this is not"
6872920,6873680," right question"
6873680,6875240," the right question"
6875240,6875460," is"
6875460,6876200," why"
6876200,6877260," could it not"
6877260,6878160," be used for bytes"
6878160,6880940," that's the right"
6880940,6881600," question"
6881600,6884080," asking wrong"
6884080,6884960," wrong questions"
6884960,6886300," why could it not"
6886300,6887160," be used for bytes"
6887160,6888560," if you think"
6888560,6889060," about it"
6889060,6891180," there is no reason"
6891180,6896660," all right"
6896660,6911700," that's it for today"
6911700,6912880," thanks everyone"
6912880,6914400," who's watching"
6914400,6914840," right now"
6914840,6915840," I really appreciate"
6915840,6916100," that"
6916100,6918140," have a good one"
6918140,6919300," and I see you all"
6919300,6920180," next time"
6920180,6921840," love you"
6921840,6922880," love you"
6922880,6923380," love you"
6923380,6923380," love you"
6923380,6923380," love you"
