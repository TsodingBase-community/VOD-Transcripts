657980,687960," There is no stream today."
687960,717940," Thank you."
717940,747920," Thank you."
747940,777920," But what's fun is that I always say that I always say that story is that I always had this plan at the back of my head to take a look at Ruby throughout its popularity and then the Ruby just died."
777920,807900," So maybe solve a problem."
807920,837880," Anyway, let's create the 16 Ruby folder."
837880,867860," Reaction streamer."
867860,897840," I know a couple of key words in Ruby."
897840,927820," The first thing."
927820,957800," So, yeah, so you can do it."
957800,987780," Nah, you can do it."
987780,1017760," Oh, look at that."
1017760,1047740," And you can do it."
1047740,1077720," Dispatch to a different tool."
1077720,1107700," You can survive without, you can do it."
1107700,1137680," And you can do it."
1137680,1167660," Would you look at that."
1167660,1197640," Oh, yeah, you can do it."
1197640,1227620," This is how you do it."
1227620,1257600," So, yeah, you can do it."
1257600,1287580," read the file."
1287580,1317560," So, I want to do it."
1317560,1347540," I would like to do it."
1347540,1377520," Okay, that's actually, okay."
1377520,1407500," It does have a map."
1407500,1437480," Okay, okay."
1437480,1467460," Holy shit, it works."
1467460,1497440," Such a fresh, so you can do it."
1497440,1527420," water."
1527420,1557400," You can do it."
1557400,1587380," Okay, okay."
1587380,1617360," drink some water."
1617360,1647340," You can do it."
1647340,1677320," Okay, you can do it."
1677320,1707300," Okay, okay."
1707300,1737280," from one, you can do it."
1737280,1767260," You can do it."
1767260,1797240," Start by, you can do it."
1797240,1827220," valid, you can do it."
1827220,1857200," It doesn't matter."
1857200,1887180," You can do it."
1887180,1917160," Take a look at, you can do it."
1917160,1947140," And, you can do it."
1947140,1977120," Now, and I suppose, and I suppose, and I suppose, and I suppose, and I suppose, and I suppose,"
1977120,2007100," Here's the sample, I don't need to do it."
2007100,2037080," And I suppose, and I suppose, okay."
2037080,2067060," And I suppose, and I suppose, and I suppose, okay."
2067060,2097040," There's a take a look at it."
2097040,2127020," Okay, so, okay."
2127020,2157000," And I suppose, okay, so, okay."
2157000,2186980," This is actually pretty, okay."
2186980,2216960," So, okay."
2216960,2246940," So, okay, so, okay."
2246940,2276920," Which code editor, which code editor, which code editor, which code editor, this is sublime, this is sublime, this one."
2276920,2306900," So, okay, so, okay."
2306900,2336880," So, okay."
2336880,2366860," So, okay."

2606700,2636680," So, okay."
2636680,2666660," So, okay."
2666660,2696640," So, okay."
2696640,2726620," How do I do, okay."
2726620,2756600," So, okay."
2756600,2786580," And in here, okay."
2786580,2816560," So, okay."
2816560,2846540," And I can create, okay."
2846540,2876520," And that will create, okay."
2876520,2906500," Here's our single field, okay."
2906500,2936480," Okay."
2936480,2966460," Okay, okay."
2966460,2996440," So, okay."
2996440,3026420," So, okay."
3026420,3056400," Do I have to do, okay."
3056400,3086380," support, okay."
3086380,3116360," Okay, okay."
3116360,3146340," here, okay."
3146340,3176320," Ruby, okay."
3176320,3206300," Okay, okay."
3206300,3236280," I'm going to do it, okay."
3236280,3266260," Okay, okay."
3266260,3296240," What the fuck, okay."
3296240,3326220," Okay, okay."
3326220,3356200," extract, okay."
3356200,3386180," And then, okay."
3386180,3416160," Okay, okay."
3416160,3446140," Okay, okay."
3446140,3476120," Okay, okay."

3596040,3626020," Okay, okay."
3626020,3656000," Okay, okay."
3656000,3685980," So, okay."
3685980,3715960," Okay, okay."
3715960,3745940," Okay, okay."
3745940,3775920," Okay, okay."
3775920,3805900," Okay, okay."
3805900,3835880," Okay, okay."
3835880,3865860," Okay, okay."
3865860,3895840," Okay, okay, okay."
3895840,3925820," Okay, okay."
3925820,3955800," Okay, okay."
3955800,3985780," Okay, okay, okay."
3985780,4015760," Okay, okay."
4015760,4045740," Okay, okay, okay."
4045740,4075720," Okay, okay, okay."
4075720,4105700," Okay, okay, okay, okay."
4105700,4135680," Okay, okay, okay, okay."
4135680,4165660,", okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
4165660,4195640,", okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
4195640,4225620,", okay, okay, okay."
4225620,4255600,", okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
4255600,4285580,", okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
4285580,4315560,", okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
4315560,4316560," Okay."
4316560,4330560," Oh my god, I'm brain farting. I need to wait for my team. Okay."
4330560,4335560," Here's the ticket."
4335560,4340560," Here's the field."
4343560,4354560," And if it's valid, that means we have to break out of the loop, right?"
4354560,4356560," We're breaking out of the loop."
4356560,4365560," If it turned out to be invalid for all of them, we essentially return that value."
4365560,4368560," That's what we do here, right?"
4368560,4370560," Hopefully that's how it's going to work."
4371560,4374560," And then we can do it like this, right?"
4374560,4376560," I want to double check that I did everything correctly."
4376560,4378560," Field value valid."
4378560,4382560," We iterate through all the ranges and we check if they're not with the ranges."
4382560,4385560," So if something is not in the range, we instantly return false."
4385560,4387560," If we went through, it will be true."
4387560,4391560," So for each value for each field, if field is valid."
4391560,4394560," So this is a field that we do care about."
4394560,4395560," There we go."
4395560,4397560," If some of them is invalid, we instantly returned."
4397560,4398560," Okay."
4398560,4406560," And then first invalid field, we provide the ticket."
4406560,4408560," We provide the fields, right?"
4408560,4409560," We'll provide the ticket."
4409560,4410560," We'll provide the fields."
4410560,4413560," And so the thing has to be the sum."
4413560,4416560," So we need to do something like result."
4416560,4418560," This result plus equal that."
4418560,4420560," And we're going to return the result."
4420560,4424560," I'm not even sure if this will work, by the way, in Ruby, but I will just assume that it does."
4424560,4431560," And afterwards, I'm going to do put part one, right?"
4431560,4434560," It's going to be part one like this."
4434560,4435560," There we go."
4435560,4437560," So that should be the part one solution."
4437560,4438560," How about that?"
4438560,4439560," How about that?"
4439560,4442560," Which you didn't expect me to actually come up with a solution that quick."
4442560,4447560," Does Ruby enforce indentation like Python?"
4447560,4451560," I have no idea, but it does have semicolons."
4451560,4455560," And I suppose you have to put semicolons when you put everything on a single line."
4455560,4456560," Maybe it just..."
4456560,4457560," I don't know."
4457560,4458560," I don't care, to be fair."
4458560,4464560," I'm going to just solve this problem in Ruby and then I'm going to forget about it."
4464560,4468560," That's how it's going to go, chat."
4468560,4470560," That's how it's going to go."
4470560,4471560," First try."
4471560,4477560," I'm not sure if it's going to be first try because I was just, you know, dumping the code into the file without checking anything."
4477560,4479560," I'm not even sure if it's going to run right now."
4479560,4483560," Let me give it a try."
4483560,4485560," Okay."
4485560,4486560," So..."
4486560,4488560," You see, it's not correct."
4488560,4489560," It's already not correct."
4489560,4490560," So..."
4490560,4492560," What did you expect from me?"
4492560,4494560," So, let's put it like that."
4494560,4495560," And..."
4495560,4496560," So, it was 7..."
4496560,4498560," 7..."
4498560,4499560," 55..."
4499560,4500560," 38..."
4500560,4502560," It was really strange."
4503560,4504560," But to be fair..."
4504560,4505560," Um..."
4505560,4508560," Sometime..."
4508560,4509560," Okay."
4509560,4511560," So, what's going to happen if you actually be here?"
4511560,4513560," So, what if it's completely valid?"
4513560,4514560," Right?"
4514560,4515560," What if it's completely valid?"
4515560,4517560," We can just try to return -1."
4517560,4518560," Right?"
4518560,4519560," So, we can just return..."
4519560,4520560," By the way, my tea is ready."
4520560,4521560," Not really tea is ready."
4521560,4522560," I mean..."
4522560,4523560," The kettle."
4523560,4524560," The kettle is ready."
4524560,4525560," Uh..."
4525560,4526560," Okay."
4526560,4527560," So..."
4527560,4528560," So..."
4528560,4529560," So..."
4529560,4531560," Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do..."
4531560,4532560," Um..."
4532560,4533560," Okay."
4533560,4534560," So..."
4534560,4535560," Okay."
4535560,4536560," So..."
4536560,4537560," Um..."
4537560,4538560," Okay."
4538560,4539560," So..."
4539560,4540560," Um..."
4540560,4541560," Okay."
4541560,4542560," So..."
4542560,4543560," Um..."
4543560,4544560," Okay."
4544560,4545560," So..."
4545560,4546560," Um..."
4546560,4547560," Okay."
4547560,4548560," So..."
4548560,4549560," Um..."
4549560,4550560," Okay."
4550560,4551560," So..."
4551560,4552560," Um..."
4552560,4553560," Okay."
4553560,4554560," So..."
4554560,4555560," Um..."
4555560,4556560," Um..."
4556560,4557560," Okay."
4557560,4558560," Um..."
4558560,4559560," Okay."
4559560,4560560," Um..."
4560560,4561560," Okay."
4561560,4562560," So..."
4562560,4563560," What we need to..."
4563560,4563560," It..."
4563560,4564560," It's kinda strange."
4564560,4565560," Like..."
4565560,4566560," How..."
4566560,4567560," Yeah..."
4567560,4569560," Uh..."
4569560,4570560," So..."
4570560,4571560," I'm gonna put it like this."
4571560,4572560," Uh..."
4572560,4573560," And..."
4573560,4575560," If x is greater or equal than zero."
4575560,4576560," Then..."
4576560,4577560," Uh..."
4577560,4578560," I'm gonna just print it."
4578560,4579560," And see if it's correct or not."
4579560,4580560," We'll see how it goes."
4580560,4581560," Uh..."
4581560,4584560," And I think it is in fact correct."
4584560,4585560," Almost."
4585560,4586560," 55..."
4586560,4587560," Uh..."
4587560,4588560," 55..."
4588560,4589560," Uh..."
4589560,4597560," Why there's four of them?"
4597560,4599560," Why does it return seven?"
4599560,4602060," Uh-huh."
4602060,4602560," I think I know..."
4602560,4603560," I know..."
4603560,4604560," What was the mistake?"
4604560,4608560," I think I know what's the mistake."
4608560,4609560," Uh..."
4609560,4611560," It's one of those situations."
4615560,4617560," I need my tea."
4617560,4618560," I need my tea."
4618560,4619560," I need my tea."
4619560,4620560," I need my tea."
4620560,4621560," I need my tea."
4621560,4622560," I need my tea."
4622560,4623560," I need my tea."
4623560,4624560," I need my tea."
4624560,4625560," I need my tea."
4625560,4626560," I need my tea."
4626560,4627560," I need my tea."
4627560,4628560," I need my tea."
4628560,4629560," I need my tea."
4629560,4631560," So first invalid field."
4631560,4635560," I go through the values of the ticket."
4635560,4637560," I go through the fields of the..."
4637560,4639560," Yeah, of the fields."
4639560,4649560," If the field valid, I need to break out of the loop and go to the next value."
4649560,4654560," So if it is invalid, that means it's going to be invalid for all of them."
4654560,4658560," So instantly return the value."
4658560,4664560," How can I get trusted to send one link?"
4664560,4667560," If you're asking how to get trusted, forget about it."
4667560,4669560," You're already disqualified for being trusted."
4669560,4670560," If you're interested."
4670560,4671560," Okay, so..."
4671560,4672560," Okay, so..."
4672560,4673560," Okay."
4673560,4674560," Okay."
4674560,4676560," All right."
4676560,4690560," oh"
4690560,4704560," all right"
4705200,4715360," ticket first and valid and the indication the first of it is that okay um for value in tickets one more"
4715360,4730880," time for value in tickets all right so each value um for field in fields okay if field value"
4735200,4744960," field value is uh valid right if it is valid uh that means we found a single field for which that"
4744960,4752480," value is valid so we break out of that loop to move on to the next value right to move on to the next"
4752480,4758480," value uh what's funny is that okay so i think uh yeah i see"
4763280,4766560," yeah i see what's going on so um"
4766560,4772480," valid true right"
4774080,4781120," valid false right so initially it's going to be true until um"
4784960,4786160," so it's false"
4786160,4791200," then it's going to become true all right"
4794880,4797360," and if it's not valid"
4797360,4800240," uh"
4800240,4808960," useless pony please read the title i would really appreciate you if you read the title please"
4810000,4813600," okay so if it's not valid uh we instantly"
4813600,4821760," we instantly return"
4821760,4824080," that value"
4826160,4831280," we instantly return that value after that i'm going to return one i hope i didn't make the uh"
4831280,4837200," mistake uh mistake again right so i iterated the values um"
4837200,4844640," the field is going to be in uh initially invalid once you encounter at least one field for which it's"
4844640,4851840," valid is going to become valid true and we're going to skip through all of that right so hopefully i"
4851840,4857040," well the code looks different from what i actually initially wrote and it still"
4857040,4859120," says"
4859120,4864640," why 40 is incorrect like it says that 40 is incorrect but it's not true"
4864640,4880240," uh okay so let me try to to look at that um for some of them we have ranges"
4881840,4882560," uh"
4882560,4895680," okay oh it's or okay if it's it's it has to be the same here oh my god i was actually rushing too much"
4895680,4897360," all right so um"
4897360,4905600," yeah so we need to find for yeah if it is correct"
4907120,4912960," it's oh my god if it's correct for at least one of them it's going to be true otherwise it's going"
4912960,4920320," to be false right so there we go so which rate all the things if it's uh valid for at least one of"
4920320,4930240," them is going to be that and there we go 455 okay and uh then um i can start okay so let's see"
4932080,4939840," uh i'm peter again i'm peter again so 70 and uh wait a second"
4939840,4944560," why 12"
4950400,4957440," excuse me"
4957440,4962720," 4 55 12"
4962720,4967280," you want to return zero not minus one"
4972000,4973440," why do i want to return zero"
4973440,4976080," ah"
4976080,4982480," okay that's it's it's not about returning zero"
4982480,4985360," uh"
4985360,4998240," okay okay uh it's not about returning zero now okay it works it works for the part one uh also do we even"
4998240,5004240," announce the uh the file the file which we read i don't think so um"
5004240,5008320," oops"
5008320,5014240," input file and uh it's going to be a file path there we go"
5014240,5021920," so here's the input file here is the uh pretty printing situation and this is the part one"
5023840,5030720," okay um so let's start uh maybe i i don't want to print the the input like this i don't think it's"
5030720,5036320," it's that useful i don't think it's that useful okay and i'm going to go to the make and i'm going"
5036320,5039520," to include input txt i'm going to include input txt"
5039520,5048720," there we go so this should be the final result hopefully uh let's see let's see and first try"
5048720,5053280," mother how about that how about that yes"
5053280,5061120," can your python do that by the way"
5066480,5078720," first try um let's continue to the part two let's continue this problem oh it's too much to read"
5078720,5086080," i hate these descriptions now that you've identified which tickets contains invalid values discard"
5086080,5094560," those tickets entirely use the remaining valid tickets to determine which field is which uh all"
5094560,5100640," right so using the valid ranges for each field determine what order in uh in the field appears"
5100640,5108560," on the ticket the order is consistent uh between all tickets if seat is the third field it is the third"
5108560,5113680," field for every ticket including your ticket for example suppose you have the following notes"
5114800,5124000," okay uh okay uh so this is a sample two as far as you can see sample zero two txt uh and um is that the"
5124000,5130240," same i think it's different i think it's different this time so this is sample uh that sample zero one"
5131120,5137120," so and we will include all of them here so the sample zero two txt"
5137120,5148320," cool um the following notes based on the nearby tickets in the above example the first position must"
5148320,5154960," be row the second position must be class and the third position must be seat you can conclude that in"
5154960,5158880," your ticket class is a 12 uh 11 okay"
5158880,5164960," that's very interesting"
5164960,5175680," uh what do you get if you so okay do we how much data do we have in the input how big is the data"
5177440,5187600," the data is actually quite small just like my pp ah nice okay uh let me see so essentially we can try to"
5187600,5197440," you know check for how many fields uh for how many fields that particular value is correct"
5198080,5205280," and check that for each fields in each ticket and just find the intersections you know what i mean"
5205280,5209680," just find the intersections and based on these intersections we will be able to"
5209680,5214240," you know that remind the the fields and stuff like that should press it forward um"
5214240,5221520," now so what's the what do you get if you multiply this okay um based on the nearby tickets"
5222160,5228480," am i reading the correct thing um there's a nearby tickets in the above example uh the first position"
5228480,5235920," must be row second position class uh you can include that in your ticket class is 12 and see this 13."
5235920,5243680," once you work out which field is which look for the six fields on your ticket that start"
5243680,5250960," with the word departure what do you get if you multiply those six field values together"
5252160,5258880," um the generate custom input for each player according to the pp site you have to you have to submit it"
5258880,5265600," uh when you register on the on the website so that's the main requirement"
5265600,5275520," all right you know photo and stuff uh anyway so um"
5279760,5286320," all right"
5286320,5294720," so let's do let's start with a little bit of experimentation shall we shall we shall we shall we"
5294720,5301520," so we have it here we have a part one and we're gonna introduce a part two right so here it is um"
5304960,5311920," part one part one and part two uh but we also need to filter out everything that is not a valid ticket"
5311920,5315680," right first invalid field"
5315680,5324880," uh i want to introduce a function that would also tell us something interesting so for example"
5324880,5332720," ticket valid question mark and we have to provide the ticket and the field uh and we're going to implement"
5332720,5341120," that in terms of the first invalid field so essentially first invalid field or a ticket"
5341120,5348960," fields and it's valid when it's greater equal than zero right something like this"
5348960,5357520," something like this so this is a ticket valid and that will enable us with filtering out uh invalid tickets"
5357520,5366480," right so uh i can do something like input nearby filter finally we can use filter chat who was"
5366480,5372400," suggesting to use filter for parsing input where is that person actually several persons now we have"
5372400,5382000," an opportunity to use filter are you happy now are you happy now all right so uh here is the ticket right"
5382000,5387200," here here here is the ticket and i'm going to the ticket valid i'm going to check whether this ticket is"
5387200,5397600," valid uh and it's going to be input fields there we go and that will give us valid tickets uh"
5397600,5406960," wait a second it has to be actually less than zero excuse me almost made a huge mistake in it uh valid"
5411600,5420560," valid tickets so here are the valid all of the valid tickets uh and i want to probably print them"
5420560,5428640," with pp with my pp and uh let me see so here we have that i want to exclude the input for now"
5428640,5436960," so it does not you know interfere with my experimentation uh and i forgot to run part two"
5436960,5444240," don't you look at that i'm going to run part two uh so it's going to put part two"
5444240,5454000," uh this is python five such a funny joke you're a funny guy my god thank you thank you for"
5454000,5459920," selling me such a funny joke okay so what do we have here so filter doesn't really work undefined method"
5459920,5474000," filter god damn it okay so uh 55 why did it work though uh why did it work tickets valid tickets"
5474000,5481920," so maybe i don't know how to use um how to use a filter maybe i don't know how to do that"
5484000,5494560," ruby array not rubbery god damn it i mean it it worked anyway um so a filter uh cool"
5504480,5515040," select select why the fuck is called select well what filter select"
5515040,5523520," filter what the hell is wrong with these people"
5527760,5532480," okay okay it's an alias so that means it doesn't matter or okay select"
5532480,5540240," holy what the fuck is wrong with these people okay um okay"
5540240,5552320," sure um so in this case like in in case of like a sample one we have only a single uh valid uh this one"
5552320,5558560," all the all the all the all these things are valid actually all the things are valid uh now so here we"
5558560,5569440," have a better tickets um what do we need to do with them so i can take the first ticket right"
5569440,5573840," i can take the first ticket"
5577120,5584000," yeah uh so let's let's introduce a function let's introduce a function uh valid fields"
5584000,5591520," for ticket for value yeah valid fields for value so you accept the value and you accept the fields"
5591520,5600400," right and um here we're gonna do the following thing um sample one is useless for second thank you"
5601280,5612320," my god thank you so much okay uh fields uh filter uh select i'm sorry i'm sorry select uh select"
5612320,5628800," uh field um so this is a field and value has to be uh fields low value value um"
5632000,5639920," it's not the fields it's a single field field high cool so what i want to do here by the way i want to"
5639920,5646400," take uh actually the first the first ticket here right i want to take the first ticket here and for"
5646400,5651760," that ticket i want to print all of the value of um you know valid fields for it i don't know if it's"
5651760,5663200," gonna work uh we'll find out so this is the thing i am trying to do here uh-huh and uh valid fields"
5663200,5674160," valid fields for value we provide the value um the value is actually oh yeah okay so that means we'll have"
5674160,5679120," to iterate the values we'll have to iterate those values for value in"
5679120,5689120," value in this okay so that's going to be the value that's going to be the value here's the value and"
5689120,5696640," here's the fields hopefully it will do a pretty printing here so we'll see better but uh i don't"
5696640,5701600," know i don't know about that yet i don't know about that of course it didn't do anything so we don't have a"
5701600,5707360," fields because we have to access them from the input we have to access them from the input"
5707360,5714960," and uh there's no low because what is it called what is it called it has to be called low but it's not"
5722400,5736400," by what what field fields fields field low high what um do they do they actually do the"
5736400,5744480," walkie walking oh we have you have to iterate through the ranges oh okay oh"
5747360,5752800," yeah because they have ranges and oh it has several of them by the way is there any like"
5752800,5756960," the general there's only two of them right there's usually two of them"
5756960,5763680," oh this is such a boring task it's just you know pile on top of pile on like you know complexity and"
5763680,5767840," there's nothing interesting and such this is like really not satisfying tasks"
5771200,5776880," mundane hopefully the next task is going to be more interesting um"
5776880,5787360," all right so um yeah we have to we have to like here's the single field within that field you have"
5787360,5794560," to iterate through the ranges um and so can i do something like this do"
5796560,5807120," uh and yeah so select do and and i suppose i have to do it like this field right so this is the field"
5807120,5813600," uh and in here for each individual field you could say that the next task is a repeat of the previous"
5813600,5821600," day with edit complexity ah okay so yeah this is basically like a complexity management to be fair"
5821600,5829760," nothing nothing nothing particularly special field arranges uh so here are the ranges for uh low high"
5829760,5832640," low high in range to do what"
5832640,5847280," so if one of them is correct we automatically return true right we automatically return true if one of the"
5847280,5857840," field the range actually i'm sorry if one of the fields the ranges um correct so the field is correct"
5857840,5866160," if it's not uh we instantly return false okay so that should do the trick that should do the trick um"
5866720,5871680," okay um can i you know run it now um"
5871680,5877200," this is not what i wanted to be fair"
5877200,5880320," um"
5880320,5889280," select why i wanted to have like a list of those things"
5890800,5894800," excuse me where can i have a list of those things why did it return true"
5894800,5905200," wait a second when i did return true did it return from this procedure instead of like inner do and thing"
5905200,5917200," really wait what um is this even a lambda is this even a lambda i'm i'm not sure chats is this lambda"
5920800,5921840," um"
5921840,5927200," try inspect how does it answer my question"
5927200,5932720," why are you guys constantly asking questions that i never ask"
5932720,5936800," okay uh ruby lambda"
5946480,5948160," i think it should return an array"
5948160,5954560," why select doesn't return an array well like i mean i don't care what returns array or what not"
5954560,5957920," i question like my question is why does it act like that"
5957920,5963120," okay like i need an explanation that's what i need that doesn't explain anything"
5963120,5969040," you see what i mean you see what i mean it's just doesn't explain anything um"
5972800,5973600," okay so"
5973600,5994960," getting angry at the language again god damn it"
6002800,6018640," return in lambda how to use lambda in ruby"
6018640,6022640," return in lambda how to use lambda in ruby"
6024560,6032000," because i would expect if you do a return in lambda"
6032000,6040800," yeah"
6040800,6045280," language doesn't matter you get them right"
6045280,6048560," you get them right language doesn't matter"
6050080,6054720," uh procedure okay so there's a difference between procedure return and lambda return"
6054720,6064720," a block shouldn't be a lambda right you ask me you you think i know how to program in ruby"
6064720,6069360," like i see this language for the first time in my life like why are you asking me um"
6070880,6074720," uh so cool"
6074720,6088240," maybe we can try to conduct an experiment i mean we're already kind of conducting an experiment so if i'm"
6088240,6090800," going to return true what if i return 69"
6093760,6098000," yeah it does return 69 so that that means it returns from okay"
6098000,6100800," so do"
6100800,6109600," i think i understand what's going on ruby lambda show me show me the lambda"
6114720,6118560," how do how to how to use lambda okay how to use block"
6118560,6123600," uh-huh understand ruby blocks"
6123600,6129280," so this is a block okay can i do lambda"
6138160,6144720," how do i construct it can also take arguments all right so what if i do something like"
6144720,6149840," so this is the lambda if i understand correctly right oh wait a second"
6149840,6157520," uh yep so this is the lambda"
6161360,6165360," and maybe i can do it like that now will it work no it's not gonna work"
6165360,6174560," this is so inconvenient okay um"
6174560,6182640," so let's let's do the variable uh the variable trick let's do the variable trick it's gonna be"
6185280,6193040," valid false right this is a valid false and um when i like do something like this i'm gonna"
6193040,6201040," say valid true this is a valid true and a break out of the loop and i return the valid here all right"
6201040,6205280," so that's what we're gonna do here i don't need semicolons i do know that but"
6205280,6213120," emacs stop okay this is what i'm talking about okay we had to do this stupid i like i didn't know"
6213120,6218240," that if you return from block you don't return it uh you return from a whole procedure it's really"
6218240,6224640," inconvenient but i guess they have a special like syntax for that maybe we have to use lambda but i"
6224640,6229760," don't really care about this language that much to research it so okay here is the fields and i want"
6229760,6237040," to map all of that uh so here's the field and i want to take the field's name i'm going to take"
6237040,6241200," the field's name and i just want to see only the field's name there we go so this is what i'm talking"
6241200,6251920," about right this is what i'm talking about so and then uh this is only for a single ticket right this is"
6251920,6268080," only for a single ticket um i might as well uh we might as well take an index uh so in ruby for each"
6270080,6278000," index find the current index in each loop so i i would assume that maybe it has something like this"
6278000,6287200," index like a lot of uh you have to do each with the index okay uh we can try to do that so it's going"
6287200,6303120," going to be valid uh so uh it's going to be i value uh like this and uh we're going to have index like this"
6303120,6306640," all right it's going to be index"
6309680,6322080," cool cool uh and it still prints the value because the index is the second argument okay"
6322080,6329760," uh all right so here are the indices cool so here are the indices"
6333920,6340320," nice variables which yeah i know it's so convenient holy uh so let's actually go through several tickets"
6340320,6350320," as well each um i'm going to do it like this so here is a single ticket uh yep there's a single ticket"
6350320,6355680," and for that specific ticket we're going to do a ticket each with index so here's the value um and"
6355680,6360800," before i'm going to print any of this stuff i'm going to also indent it a little bit so it's a little bit"
6360800,6366880," easier to read and i'm going to also to do the pp on this thing uh there we go so here are the things"
6366880,6375680," so uh what we can see here essentially we can see the intersections uh between all the fields here so if"
6375680,6383280," you consider the intersection uh you will notice that the only common field that they have is the row so"
6383280,6394960," the first thing has to be row uh yep"
6407120,6412160," cool cool so uh maybe i'm gonna um yeah"
6412160,6419280," so i'm just thinking how we can do that efficiently um"
6419280,6426640," we can turn it into some sort of a union uh ruby union"
6429360,6437440," not are you serious uh okay union for the array union for the array"
6437440,6444960," okay that's pretty cool so essentially you can take this thing"
6446800,6451680," union and then the second thing right like this"
6451680,6461040," uh and i'm gonna put it here and no method union for array thank you so much is that a third party"
6461040,6462320," dependency of some sort"
6462320,6468320," uh it feels like some sort of state party dependency"
6473120,6480960," okay ruby array union intersection maybe it's an intersection maybe that's what it's called"
6489040,6495600," oh oh oh that's cool wait a second you can do like that"
6495600,6503280," huh oh that's cool look at that you can find an intersection by using this operator"
6503280,6510880," and union yeah i actually need the intersection not not union yeah so that's gonna be this thing"
6510880,6517040," that's pretty cool so they have a special operator for this kind of so this is something that we can use"
6517040,6529760," in the future um all right so um how can we do all of this i'm just thinking"
6529760,6537120," so if we find the intersection between intersections between all of them all of them um what would be"
6537120,6543040," the easiest way to do that like can i zip a lot of like arrays together um"
6544800,6547920," all like transpose the matrix of some sort"
6547920,6558640," ah that would be kind of cool that would be kind of cool so um i want to make a small break by the"
6558640,6562800," way because i want to pee i really want to pee so let me close all of that"
6564880,6577280," so small break um fold intersection i don't know"
6577280,6591280," all right let's make a small break and you guys have fun"
6591280,6604000," so um"
6604000,6604000," so"
6604000,6616720," so"

6896560,6896560," you"
6896560,6901700," ruby like this right so here's that and then i can say transpose it doesn't really work like"
6901700,6906620," everything from this website doesn't work ever like i don't even know what this website and why"
6906620,6912420," does it provide so many useful functions but none of them work uh maybe because um there's third"
6912420,6919040," party but it's okay so maybe it's available in some of the versions uh here but i'm not sure"
6919040,6927040," which version of ruby i have here right so um two five five so it's two five five and it's still"
6927040,6936600," not available so it's it's whatever um so yeah turn rows into columns in ruby okay so how would you do"
6936600,6944820," something like that uh the hard way okay"
6944820,6953560," easy way to to do this is using a transpose did they misspell it by the way did they just misspell it"
6953560,6961560," so if i take this thing and i save it to here right i save it to here so here it is and then i can do"
6961560,6969820," transpose oh i i misspelled it apparently uh yeah i think i just miss misspelled it but you can"
6969820,6976540," essentially just transpose them that's nice um so essentially what that means i wonder if it's"
6976540,6978900," going to be too slow maybe maybe it will be maybe it will not"
6978900,6990000," i3 config i don't really know what you guys are talking about you can find my dot files here and"
6990000,6995760," my i3 config is actually completely unmodified well i added a couple of additional bindings"
6995760,7001840," and to be fair i don't understand why people keep asking me about my i3 config i literally use whatever"
7001840,7008120," i3 generated for me like what do you want just just let i3 to generate config for you and you're going to"
7008120,7014960," have the same setup as easy as that uh transpose uh okay so we transpose this thing"
7014960,7023900," and after that i want to map it and uh yeah so this is going to be that and we're going to have"
7023900,7031620," like columns right so this is a column and inside of that column um i wonder if you can actually"
7031620,7040260," chain this shit like that is this an idiomatic uh ruby code by the way is this an idiomatic ruby code"
7040260,7046520," this is how you program in ruby right so i don't know maybe it's not going to even work we'll see"
7046520,7053180," uh so for each column so you transpose and then you get columns and you need to fold them"
7053180,7070860," folding and curry uh array give me array please so what about fold now can you can you do fold reduce"
7073020,7081020," uh what what what what else people called fold so i know there's fold reduce none of them work"
7082540,7086380," well maybe it doesn't really matter because you can always just simulate it yourself"
7086380,7096940," all right so uh so result if i do something like this so and uh two three four is going to include"
7096940,7104460," this actually has to be like this god damn this is actually so bad we need an intersection but maybe it's"
7104460,7113580," not that bad because you can do something like this result is going to be column first uh and then you"
7113580,7132300," can do column uh each uh i'm sorry i'm just uh brain farting a little bit so uh yeah and then we can do"
7132300,7140620," something like result x and then you can return results i think you do have any reduce function"
7140620,7154060," am i looking at the wrong thing i'm looking at all right"
7154060,7161100," am i missing something maybe it has it's some sort of extension method maybe it does support extension"
7161100,7171260," action methods um what's up on the bot hello hello how are you doing so like i tried like you i tried"
7171260,7180540," um hello hello everyone really good to see you all today uh okay so it's doing things um"
7180540,7187180," it's doing things it's really strange like it's not supposed to do this kind of stuff"
7189580,7195420," uh it feels like it's not doing anything at all did it did it even work did it work"
7195420,7200620," okay and then i can do it and it doesn't change that thing"
7200620,7209260," ah because i didn't return yeah i have to return it here there we go"
7210780,7221020," uh what's up what's up what's up on the booth cool nice all right look at that chat so this is the"
7221020,7232060," intersection between all of these rows so uh what we need to do we need to find the first one with uh a"
7232060,7240620," single value and we have to remove that value out of each of them right then find another one with a"
7240620,7245980," single value and remove that out of each of them so this is this is the algorithm right this is going"
7245980,7251580," to be the algorithm that we can try to pursue so i'm not sure if it's going to work for our case but"
7251580,7260060," there we go so we know row we remove it so class is another one we remove it and this is how we know"
7260060,7265980," that the order is role class seat and is that the correct order uh"
7270780,7277340," class is 12 so that means it's second one row is 11 that means it's first one and see this 13 that"
7277340,7283340," means it's a yeah okay so we found the correct order you see so basically we find all the intersections"
7283340,7289100," and we're starting like uh unwinding this entire thing something like that the fact that the problem"
7289100,7295020," is solvable by defining defining hints to that this method must work on your actual input otherwise it"
7295020,7303580," would have a single solution uh yeah all right so we can try to look at the uh at the input here as well"
7303580,7311740," right and uh what's the intersections for the input so here are the intersections for the input uh and let's"
7311740,7323260," see if there is a single thing here that contains like a single field because i'm curious we can actually"
7323260,7329020," try to find that automatically to be fair you can try to find that out there we go we already found"
7329020,7335820," one so there is one field that contains train right so there's one field that contains train so this"
7335820,7345100," according to all of the intersections it's that so um yeah uh and we just have to work it out"
7347660,7352780," how did you select the same text and deleted them all the same time using vim yes i'm using vim this is"
7352780,7361580," the uh you know the functionality of vim it comes with the vim as well all right so um yeah that's cool"
7361580,7368220," but the question is how we're gonna work it out how we're gonna work it out first of all"
7369020,7381180," uh we need to maintain the list of all of the fields that we've already processed"
7381180,7386700," all right maintain the list of all the fields okay so"
7391580,7397820," uh intersections uh intersections yeah these are intersections and we're gonna keep them there so"
7397820,7405900," here are the intersections um i want to kind of also do each uh"
7405900,7413980," but but seriously i i'm using uh multiple courses extension for emacs that's how i do that"
7413980,7422460," so uh each with index right each with index and here's the value there's the index"
7422460,7428220," um and what i want to do here if"
7428220,7435740," um let's call it set can i use it can you set i think i'm gonna call it set"
7436380,7444220," if it's length equal one then i want to do puts"
7444220,7452620," index i just want to see how many of them we have there how many of the"
7461580,7462860," it didn't work"
7462860,7466780," uh excuse me"
7466780,7478380," oh there's okay i see there's only one here"
7478380,7483660," so because part two somehow returned yeah yeah can you just return nothing because it"
7483660,7491180," that's so cool the input contains only one that has all the possible intersections and you can start"
7491180,7495660," unwinding from there so what about two so what if what if you have two of them"
7495660,7499980," there's only one that contains two uh what about three"
7499980,7504700," wait a second"
7504700,7512140," there's only usually one holy"
7520060,7523660," there's usually only one of a specific length"
7523660,7532700," yeah otherwise it wouldn't have a thing yeah exactly yeah so and what we can do here we can just"
7532700,7542780," sort them by their length can we um uh to to to to uh that's so cool uh"
7545820,7547660," what's up dr poopy welcome to the stream"
7547660,7555580," oh john are you still here this is so cool because i was thinking how we can do all of that and yeah"
7555580,7561260," uh you you're right uh certain sim uh otherwise it wouldn't have like a single solution it must have"
7561260,7568060," a single solution so to be fair i don't trust this website i already checked two functions from this"
7568060,7573740," website none of them worked except transpose okay um maybe i can trust this website i don't know maybe i'm"
7573740,7582860," being uh you know biased but it's kind of like it does look kind of sus it does look kind of sus so uh what"
7582860,7593340," what i want to do here is now i'm gonna do sort by uh sort by uh you beat it once again yes"
7593340,7594380," uh"
7595580,7605020," oh so set set set length sort by their length right um"
7605020,7615420," 33 yes yeah you completed the chance correctly exactly so by the way in this is a single expression"
7615420,7622540," this is a single like expression uh basically chaining several things together uh and i think i"
7622540,7627260," i don't even need to assign it uh i think i'm gonna keep you know using i can make it even bigger"
7627260,7634300," essentially by inlining this uh inlining this variable so it could be like a single huge"
7634300,7641340," you know expression uh okay so this is what we managed to sort um"
7643260,7653820," i wonder uh what would be the best way so essentially we can um keep iterating through all of these things"
7653820,7663740," but okay that ruins the order that's actually quite important that ruins the order i think"
7665340,7676060," that absolutely ruins the order hello folks um yeah so we need to preserve the order because we need"
7676060,7680460," uh to know it right"
7680460,7689100," um so how are we gonna do that so we're transposing and map mapping and all that and returning the result"
7689100,7691180," but can i map with index uh"
7691180,7694780," uh"
7694780,7699900," to ruby a ruby map with index"
7699900,7705980," uh map with index and ruby yeah is there any way to map with the index"
7705980,7711500," each with the index"
7713500,7720780," oh okay that's interesting so we can do something and this is not what i want each"
7720780,7724780," with index"
7724780,7726860," okay"
7726860,7732380," um how can i enumerate it then"
7735580,7737660," uh uh oh it's in the okay"
7737660,7745500," ah i see i think i understand it"
7745500,7749500," okay it gives you in the okay i see that that makes sense that makes sense"
7749500,7755980," transpose each with index and that gives you the index here and then we can"
7755980,7762220," keep the index like that but i want to create the structure uh so what kind of structure we're"
7762220,7767820," going to have here uh so it's going to be index and um fields"
7767820,7773420," like names of some sort and this is what we're going to have here so it's going to be index"
7773420,7778220," and the results and let's try to see what's going to happen here"
7778220,7783260," and then when we're sorting everything right we're searching we're searching it by"
7783260,7786940," the length of names by the length of names"
7787980,7794860," all right so this is what it gives us and as you can see here now this makes way more sense"
7794860,7803260," right so here's the first structure here's the second structure and they still maintain uh they're"
7803260,7811420," still maintain their index they're still maintaining their index and what i want to do here is i kind of"
7811420,7817180," want to fold all of that i want to be able to fold all of that"
7823340,7837020," all right so yeah i need to take that remove it from here um ruby remove element from array"
7837020,7842860," uh remove elements from an array how do you remove elements from the array"
7844940,7857580," oh shits bye ruby array uh-huh remove okay"
7857580,7869340," uh clear compact delete okay you can delete it uh you can delete a very specific object so if i have"
7869340,7874540," something like one two three four five and i'm gonna say delete three"
7874540,7882860," and excuse me oh it's mutable i see it's mutable um"
7882860,7889900," which is okay i guess uh maybe it's gonna work for us but that means i'll have to save all of that stuff"
7891180,7898460," um fold set difference with the result on every stop sounds like a plan yes it does sound like a plan"
7898460,7906700," thank you very much um okay so let me save this entire stuff somewhere this entire thing so this"
7906700,7912460," is a valid ticket might as well actually inline this entire thing too so it looks even more epic than it"
7912460,7929820," uh it doesn't indent properly and i'm not sure if it's gonna work yeah it does work apparently maybe"
7929820,7947020," can do something like this um well i mean here i can do two right and then end like this okay that that"
7947020,7955740," works so input take nearby select uh map all of that map all of that and that's actually pretty pretty cool"
7957100,7968220," all right now i want to save all of that um so let's call it result of some sort maybe um"
7968220,7974860," and i'm going to iterate the result uh result each"
7977340,7986460," with index with index um each with index to be fair maybe i have to do something like this uh can you do"
7986460,7996380," for e in zero five do puts i and you can okay nice so that means i'm going to do for i"
7996380,8003580," in zero uh does it include yeah it does include everything so i can do a result"
8004300,8012060," length minus one and then i can continue iterating here all right so but i want to actually it started"
8012060,8017580," iterating from one right because i i'm constantly gonna be referring to the previous one i'm constantly"
8017580,8026620," referring to the previous one and then i return the result and uh essentially results i and uh names"
8027980,8039420," remove uh remove uh remove result i minus one names zero so that's how it's gonna go"
8039420,8048140," so we're going through this entire thing and uh now if i try to run it it doesn't even work i wonder why"
8048140,8054300," so let me remove that and this works something is completely wrong here i'm not sure"
8055900,8063180," uh so what does it say undefined method oh delete i keep i keep forgetting so in my brain i keep mixing"
8063180,8072700," up delete and remove uh and as you can see it didn't work that is so amazing mate i wonder why"
8072700,8082460," so it worked only for first two but for the next one it didn't oh because you have to remove that from all"
8082460,8086220," of them i see i see so we have to remove them from all of them so it has to be like"
8086220,8091820," uh j uh in"
8091820,8098460," so we have to do it like that i think"
8098460,8107660," so we have to do it like that so j then it has to be i plus one uh up until the end but i think you"
8107660,8113420," also have to do something like minus two just in case uh all right so in result"
8113420,8124620," uh j specifically names delete result i like this and that should actually there we go we got it we"
8124620,8129580," got it boys and girls we get it so after that i can do something like a result"
8131580,8137660," looks different from yesterday hello i'm going to welcome to stream uh so what i want to do here is"
8137660,8147660," so this is a part two um yeah it's gonna print it anyway i'm gonna return uh 69 but i'm gonna do poops"
8147660,8156300," look so here they are and it didn't work no it did work look look look we figured out the positions"
8157100,8164780," of all of these motherfucking fields how about that we figured them out so yeah so at position seven we"
8164780,8171020," have a train at position 10 we have a price at position nine route and so on and so forth so the"
8171020,8177340," next thing we need to do we need we only care about fields that start with departure right so and is it"
8177340,8184620," even possible to do something like uh your mom uh starts with uh"
8184620,8193020," yo uh starts okay uh ruby string starts with"
8196220,8203820," um is it really monkey tvs name it will be jesus christ so"
8203820,8208780," uh starts uh with"
8208780,8211900," start with"
8211900,8217020," okay so uh my false"
8220620,8225820," let's see there's no previous name uh the account was created uh"
8225820,8229260," yesterday there is no previous name here"
8229260,8234860," uh cheers by the way"
8234860,8241260," um all right"
8241260,8248940," okay so let's actually filter uh only the things that start with departure right"
8249980,8251180," so let me care about those"
8251180,8256380," okay so it's gonna be a result"
8256380,8262780," was a looker for a long time decided to sub yesterday thank you i really appreciate that"
8262780,8268140," i'm i really apologize that i uh that i am salty from time to time"
8268140,8273340," getting angry at languages uh maybe i should stop apologizing for that but"
8276460,8284540," anyway so uh filter uh what do we do here filter and uh we have um let's call it x i'm not sure how i'm"
8284540,8285260," gonna call it here"
8285260,8291660," um"
8291660,8296300," okay i'm gonna take a look at that uh a little bit later"
8298460,8308700," uh so okay start with just stop okay yeah you're right on the both uh i don't know it's really"
8308700,8317900," immature for me to get angry at languages here yeah they're just languages um what happened to hair"
8318540,8326700," uh did it disappear it's still it's still there um okay so when i want to filter that i want to just do"
8326700,8331900," x uh name start yeah i think i was debated start with"
8331900,8336780," uh input i think i'm gonna take a little bit compilation"
8337500,8346220," departure so here's the departure not gonna lie the high level of ruby is actually helping quite a bit"
8346220,8350220," with uh this thing i'm not gonna lie"
8350220,8359100," uh uh okay so what's that uh filter oh it's it's select it's select i keep forgetting that it's a select"
8359980,8373900," undefined and defined name um yeah names zero because they are start with cool so here are all of"
8373900,8382780," these fields that start with departure right and we have to take the values of those fields in my ticket"
8382780,8394060," right and sum them up this was in my ticket and sum them up um yeah once you work out which field is"
8394060,8398140," which look at the six fields in your ticket that start with the word departure what do you get if"
8398140,8405660," you multiply these six values together okay so that makes sense sneaky big thank you thank you so much"
8405660,8410140," for twitch prime subscription thank you thank you thank you your first subscription by the way and welcome"
8410700,8415660," to our epic ruby club that uh where we get salty sometimes at languages"
8415660,8421340," i'm a d fan yeah d actually is not that that uh yeah it's just"
8421340,8429500," it's like a combination of c plus plus and java but somehow it took a good parts of both of these"
8429500,8437340," languages well in both of these languages do have uh oh my god ivan check thank you thank you so much for"
8437340,8442780," which prime subscription and welcome to our epic ruby club by the way uh you know uh people who don't"
8442780,8447980," speak russian they don't know that in such nicknames you're supposed to read for us check"
8447980,8455420," because it's you know resembles the cyrillic letter you know um check which looks like four"
8456060,8458460," so yeah this is how we're supposed to read it"
8458460,8468780," well i mean you're supposed to read it like you're supposed to read uh like latin as cyrillic"
8468780,8474300," and if you interpret it as cyrillic this is how we're supposed to pronounce it um yeah"
8483900,8488460," so let's speak is just russian yeah so it's basically like a russian version of let's speak"
8488460,8489100," of some sort"
8495740,8504220," i read laden numbers as numbers yes nice one okay so uh we just need to get the corresponding fields"
8504220,8513020," right i filter everything off and now i'm gonna take a look at these things and i'm gonna map them"
8513020,8520380," right how i'm gonna map them i'm gonna take the input and i'm gonna take my field uh my ticket and i'm"
8520380,8531740," gonna use their index uh and there we go so here are the fields that start with departure in my ticket"
8531740,8534860," and now i have to multiply them so um"
8534860,8541580," some array i know that i don't need some"
8544780,8548140," you go for it uh yeah"
8548140,8551660," inject"
8551660,8554700," huh wait a second"
8554700,8559020," uh ruby inject"
8559020,8569340," reduce i i couldn't find reduce like it didn't exist okay it combines all elements by oh"
8570940,8574380," all right i think okay let's try reduce um"
8574380,8582780," uh reduce uh is that how i have to do that uh okay so and there you go"
8582780,8588300," hopefully it didn't overflow hopefully it didn't overflow"
8588300,8595660," and it's funny how it didn't print anything for part two because samples don't contain things that start"
8595660,8604380," with departure isn't there a fold uh well there's reduce apparently okay so uh i think we did solve"
8604380,8611500," part two uh and that should be the final result of part two if i'm not mistaken but i'm so afraid to"
8611500,8620860," submit it to be fair uh so and by the way the solution for the part two is this huge single expression"
8620860,8628060," actually not a single expression um it's so i feel so bad that i had to you know interrupt that huge"
8628060,8634460," single expression right with this four like nested four uh but this is something that had to be done"
8634460,8638220," this is something that had to be done"
8640540,8647580," you can make it yeah i suppose uh use delete if to keep chaining"
8647580,8659420," maybe ah it's too late uh let's actually see if if this is the solution i'm too lazy to be fair i mean"
8659420,8668220," if it if it works maybe you know down first try on the language i never programmed before seriously i"
8668220,8674220," this is the biggest program in ruby i've ever written in my entire life i never programmed that language"
8674220,8683340," before uh so do i like it it's yet another language i would say like it's just yet another python for me"
8683820,8690940," um that's kind of cool that you can keep changing things and uh yeah feels so satisfying but overall"
8690940,8698540," it's just yet another language and um you know it's not bad it was not bad at all and uh yeah both of"
8698540,8708860," the parts were first tried and to be fair things like transpose uh and union i think yeah yeah so we used"
8708860,8715900," like two very high level things here specifically transpose and uh intersection and that helped quite"
8715900,8720780," a bit if i programmed in c i would have to implement these things myself but i'm glad that ruby just"
8720780,8728140," provided these things content next and maybe we'll see about that ruby seems weird why did they even make"
8728140,8737020," it uh why not because they could so the question is not why they didn't not why did they make it and what"
8737020,8743820," the question is why did you uh didn't you make any language so they make it because they want they wanted"
8743820,8748780," to and because they could why didn't you make your own language is that because you could cannot"
8751020,8758300," uh very cool impressive i would say congrats thank you so"
8758300,8767420," is this the first time yes this is like literally first try i haven't tried crystal the only thing i"
8767420,8771100," know about crystal is that it's a statically type native compiled ruby that's it"
8773580,8778220," uh yeah elixir next i don't know what's going to be the next thing which we'll see"
8778220,8784220," no bad for the first five yeah it's almost like i have 15 years of software development"
8784220,8791100," yeah not bad for the first try it's almost like i've written code before"
8791580,8796940," and i know how to write code just it helped me a little bit to to do that"
8796940,8806940," so and uh by the way for those who doesn't know who just joined recently we are doing"
8806940,8813740," uh each problem in different language right so here is the list of the languages we tried so far"
8813740,8820060," so rust haskell java dc plus python go jigs or camel cny imperial c sharp php pascal and ruby today"
8820060,8825580," and all of these uh solutions they pass both of the parts so we can find all of them here and i'm"
8825580,8831420," going to submit the ruby solution now all right so i usually create a readme that explains how to"
8831420,8844860," run this entire thing so um day 16 uh right and we're gonna give this thing here there we go really"
8845820,8855580," oh nice one so if you you know submit this thing with a leading slash it will return you 404 and you"
8855580,8859980," know what's funny is that it's it's absolutely correct behavior because according to the semantic"
8859980,8868860," of url uh additional slash actually like a different it's a different url um but i mean people usually just"
8868860,8877500," you know ignore that um yeah it is true it is true for some for example something like https example.com"
8877500,8884460," uh like slash a and slash slash a are completely different resources seriously they are completely"
8884460,8890620," different resources so at least according to the specifications it just depends on how specifically"
8890620,8906620," applications treat that uh which language that was new to you did you like best"
8910540,8923260," okay solution the solution the solution in uh ruby"
8929100,8937580," it was php8 yeah it was php8 yes it was php8 okay install um ruby"
8937580,8948940," downloads so this is where we can install it and make sure ruby is available in"
8950540,8959340," path path and then just do make yeah so i know my email access is prepared but it is what it is"
8959340,8969500," haven't used d yet are you trolling me i think you're trolling me oh you sent 12 you always trolling me"
8969500,8986060," yeah so uh whatever 16 um um add day 16 solution all right i'm gonna push that right to the river so"
8986060,8992380," the solution in ruby is already available so you can find it here so and uh as well as all the previous"
8992380,9002860," solutions so far right um as well as all of the previous solutions so far so this problem was"
9002860,9004540," definitely easier than the previous one"
9004540,9013500," it was definitely easier than the previous one we'll see if the next day is going to be more difficult"
9013500,9020780," or more easier but from what i heard it is a little bit more difficult and some people are not really"
9020780,9026060," happy about this 17th day uh we'll see if we'll be able to solve it on the stream we'll see we'll see"
9026060,9029260," and i don't really know what's going to be the next language we're going to use for for that"
9029260,9035900," um i didn't like apparently a lot of people didn't like day 17 so"
9035900,9044940," yeah but a lot of people didn't like it but it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't"
9045820,9050940," so um there's a lot of maintenance code even before you start the solution itself"
9050940,9054140," oh it's one of those okay it's one of those"
9054140,9056300," uh"
9056300,9062300," well people didn't like about this one did no spoilers i'm not gonna read it enough spoilers please um"
9062300,9067900," oh there's no spoilers here is the example provided the problem itself is interesting"
9068460,9074540," oh okay so there were some problem with the example we will see we'll see so uh we're gonna solve it"
9074540,9081020," tomorrow we're gonna try to solve it tomorrow and we'll see how it goes uh yep"
9081020,9091340," um no spoilers for mr streamer yeah so essentially i intentionally lag behind one day so by the time i'm"
9091340,9097020," about to solve the problem on the stream majority of people already solved the problem and they can"
9097020,9101660," easily watch without any spoilers so that's why i'm not going to solve 17 today and i'm going to wait"
9101660,9112060," until 18 and we're going to try to solve 17 tomorrow so uh yeah but in any case um today is supposed to"
9112060,9117100," be day off today is supposed to be day off but i streamed anyway because i wanted to solve this advent of"
9117100,9124300," code problem but unfortunately boys and girls it's time for me to go thanks everyone who's watching"
9124300,9129900," me right now i really appreciate that have a good one and i see you tomorrow tomorrow according to the"
9129900,9135420," schedule we're going to do a random one-off stream so essentially on random one of streams i pick a"
9135420,9140140," a random topic and stream it for the whole stream but since we have advent of code currently in place"
9140140,9145420," first we're going to try to solve the 17th problem 17th problem and if we have enough time we're"
9145420,9150460," going to continue working on a spam filter in haskell so this is something that i started"
9150460,9159900," uh like on the previous week um i implemented a very simple uh naive base uh classifier for spam"
9159900,9167180," filters and like for email spam filters and it went quite well um and it even worked it's implemented in"
9167180,9174780," husky by the way but it was too slow so uh tomorrow if we have enough time i would like to try to speed it up"
9174780,9179820," and maybe actually try to make it useful so it's going to be very interesting it can be very interesting"
9179820,9185500," so that's a spam filter thing is available here so we'll see if it's if it's going to work out of course"
9185500,9190540," if we have enough time because maybe the uh yeah tomorrow's problem is going to be so hard that i'm"
9190540,9198220," going to spend my entire time solving it we'll see uh but in any case um yeah check out our schedule page"
9198220,9203260," for more information on different projects we're working on also check out our votes channel where"
9203260,9209340," we archive all of the streams this stream is going to be there but tomorrow we archive them on the next"
9209340,9217260," day and also check out our discord server for offline discussion with the community and yeah that's it"
9217260,9228140," thanks everyone for watching uh love you"
9228140,9228140," you"
