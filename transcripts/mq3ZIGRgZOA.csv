677980,707960," Today is what?"
707960,737940," Thank you."
737940,745340," Yes, it is essentially like, you know, you know, how people, how Zoomers say that, oh, Kotlin is just a better Java."
745340,753680," Well, guess what? And this is not the first, it's far from first attempt at making better Java."
753680,783660," So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
783660,788760," index uh i think it's even like in top 20"
788760,798300," uh tom's code cosplay today i mean i don't have a long hair i'm sorry uh yeah it's actually almost"
798300,805280," in top 10 it's almost top 10 like it's actually right there and it's such like it feels like an"
805280,810380," underground language because you don't really hear about it that often but it's there it's even more"
810380,821820," popular than assembly imagine being more popular than assembly mine gut anyway so today we're gonna"
821820,826380," program that language and to be fair i never programmed in that language i uh actually saw"
826380,833900," that language being used a lot in in the enterprise sector um so yeah you yeah i i fixed my headphones"
833900,840620," it's just was like a loose cable so everything's okay um yeah uh let's see what it's all about"
840620,845340," how about that buzzing goes how about that does it sound interesting sound interesting yeah yeah yeah but"
845340,855020," but but but uh so let's uh go uh let's go so uh i'm gonna go here i haven't read the description of"
855020,862780," the problem by the way i haven't read the description of the problem so uh let me go to the aoc uh fetch"
862780,870220," prone uh and let's go more popular than well it is what it is i'm sorry i gotta do it is what it is"
870220,880780," so uh okay i didn't do anything new so i'm gonna just do 22 groovy uh 22 groovy there we go so um"
882780,886060," the best discord music bot okay"
886060,898380," so that language is that boomer okay it's that boomer that it doesn't even go to the top results"
898380,905820," when you try to google groovy all right that's that's very interesting um so it's it's the second"
905820,910700," choice okay but i'm pretty sure since i click on the second uh link if i try to look for groovy"
910700,915660," it's going to be the first one no it's still the first one so the the google doesn't immediately"
915660,922300," process your data right it needs some time so maybe it we need to wait until the scheduled batch job"
922300,926780," overnight to process all of my personal data and come up with the recommendations you know"
926780,934700," the classical enterprise shit so uh what can we download yeah the logo is actually quite cool um"
936620,944620," yeah it's it's too complex for a logo because a lot of people go uh for a much simplistic logo"
944620,949660," right but this one it has a lot of like details but it still works out and it's quite recognizable"
949660,955980," it's actually pretty cool for a complex logo it's it's pretty cool a fat learning curve are you trying"
955980,964620," to insult me well i'm gonna take it as a compliment hello by the way welcome to the stream uh uh well"
964620,972220," just draw star and write groovy on top i guess well i mean it has like a very fancy font that's what i"
972220,977420," would say it's a very fancy font it's much more complex than for example apple logo or something"
979260,985820," uh okay let's download this how about that so you can download it here apparently because it's a big"
985820,993740," download button and it's downloading it it's that simple holy you can clearly see"
993740,1000620," that it's a very old language when you can go to the website you can click on download and it will start"
1000620,1007660," downloading things because these days if you go to a zoomer language right and uh for example you click on"
1007660,1015180," get started this is the you'll have to deal with copy paste this line into your bash around this script"
1015180,1021660," install our special tool to install it get in the ass without the loop and stuff like that so uh yeah so"
1021660,1027820," this is like a clear example of the zoomer language and this is a clear example uh of the boomer language"
1027820,1036940," you just click download and um it starts downloading so yes that's simple like you know these were uh simpler"
1036940,1049100," times anyway so we downloaded it uh let's let's go i didn't have to download c to use it well you have"
1049100,1059580," to download the destroy i suppose first um is it bad or good that i prefer boomer approach and it's it's"
1059580,1067180," different um i don't know it doesn't matter um to be fair i personally don't like this approach like"
1067180,1072700," it's just too many steps and two unnecessary things like just give me the file that works why can't you"
1072700,1077660," make a file that just works why do you need like these extra layers of obstructions on top of it it's"
1077660,1086620," just it doesn't make much sense to me um okay so and i'm gonna just move this into i think uh where is"
1086620,1093980," it i think oh it's a patch group okay so i'm gonna move it here and zip insl and uh yeah okay so this"
1093980,1102700," is not a zip bomb so that means i can quite safely uh just unpack it here and it's gonna work hopefully"
1102700,1109740," holy that's a lot of files okay uh if i take a look at the the size of the unpacked thingy what's the size of"
1109740,1120940," the unpacked thingy okay um it's it's bigger than scala by the way but maybe groovy comes with a lot of"
1120940,1127340," uh batteries and shit so maybe we can use that okay let's take a look at what we have here okay uh so"
1127340,1134460," we have been so essentially this is like a package and it also has the source code um is that the source"
1134460,1139980," code of the groovy itself uh maybe doesn't matter so let's take a look at the binaries uh let's take"
1139980,1146540," a look at the binaries so we have grape uh what is grape but we do have a groovy and what is a groovy"
1146540,1152780," uh i would presume it's some sort of a bash script yes it is in fact a bash script that just runs the"
1152780,1161100," ruby and um it runs another script that is called a start groovy or something yeah layers upon layers"
1161100,1171900," is that supposed to be like a swear word that's a very interesting way of spelling"
1180540,1186780," that's funny okay uh unux yes"
1186780,1196060," this is a bad word it's it's a very bad word don't ever say it"
1196060,1200540," we didn't we didn't say that word over here okay um okay"
1206220,1212220," so people usually put a star at you indicating that there is a lot of mixes right because you know"
1212220,1217100," and linux actually kind of breaks that but this is really weird"
1217100,1225740," clearly it was a joke maybe it's a trademark but you can also avoid the trademark by doing"
1225740,1232060," uh star links and quite easy to do that anyway it doesn't matter so if i try to run this thing it's"
1232060,1238700," probably will require jvm and yeah it doesn't require a java home to be set up okay so let's actually do"
1238700,1244220," source opt java environment and now we have everything"
1244220,1254620," would you look at that we have group how about that how about that so uh maybe i'm gonna move"
1254620,1262700," groovy uh to my opt folder uh so and have a special environment that i can set up"
1262700,1268140," and just use groovy on all of the binaries from the from the path folder so i'm gonna move apache groovy"
1268140,1274780," to opt i usually also move the archives there as well just in case i mean and i also have i need to have"
1274780,1283580," a permission to do that uh okay and then i can try to uh move the folder groovy right"
1283580,1291260," uh the folder groovy oh am i doing something incorrect"
1291260,1296940," i think i i something up did i really something up wait a second"
1300140,1304620," no i didn't like why did it start like moving everything this was pretty strange"
1304620,1311580," okay let me do the following thing you used v i was hoping that it will show only the folder single"
1311580,1318220," because moving the folder is gonna okay maybe i may be missing something uh sorry so i'm gonna remove"
1318220,1324620," this thing real quick and then i'm gonna do suda unzip apache groovy like from inside of it so i'm i"
1324620,1331900," i think i'm thinking a bit bigger yeah i think i am okay so there's something really strange um"
1331900,1339260," so let me copy scala environment so this is going to be scala moment i'm going to create a group a groovy environment"
1339260,1347260," uh you you can do that because you have to do it like that and then we're going to do sudo uh groovy environment sh"
1347260,1353180," and do i need to set up a home for this thing i don't think i'm going to do that and um"
1354620,1364460," so if i go somewhere here opt where is the groovy so here is the groovy and i'm gonna"
1364460,1375580," is groovy home even a thing because a lot of like a jvm things oh yeah groovy groovy home is a thing"
1376380,1385100," uh take me java home so yeah majority of like jvm languages they have this interesting pattern that"
1385100,1391340," where you have to set up language underscore home for them so they know where is their installation and i"
1391340,1398860," think it comes from the uh java home convention so yeah it kind of makes sense it kind of makes sense okay"
1398860,1407100," so and instead of that we're gonna have a sisk uh groovy home uh and a boom and then i can do something"
1407100,1417820," like uh replace scala with groovy please mr vim thank you so much cool this is a groovy path and"
1417820,1424540," everything is okay hopefully hopefully everything is okay so then i'm gonna do source groovy environment"
1424540,1432700," please and i'm gonna go back to zozin aoc 2020 do i have groovy here do i have groovy i do have"
1432700,1439980," mother flipping groovy cool so i'm gonna go here and we're gonna write um hello world we're gonna"
1439980,1450620," write our first program in groovy we're gonna google it up groovy hello world cool yeah exactly so um"
1454540,1462700," oh wait it's that simple are you fucking shitting me okay main groovy uh"
1462700,1469900," is that extent extension of this thing yeah it is the extension cool uh so print ln"
1469900,1476860," okay vim can highlight all of that which is already pretty cool and if i do groovy uh main groovy"
1476860,1480700," is it gonna execute it or do something about it i mean jvm language by the way"
1481900,1486460," holy what okay now i understand why this language became so popular"
1486460,1493260," that is easy to set up first of all you just download the archive and the syntax is pretty"
1493260,1498620," straightforward it's like programming in python right so remember how i complained about java"
1498620,1504220," for education right is that you have to do public class main public static void and you have to explain"
1504220,1510140," that to students and you have to tell them don't worry about classes we haven't learned them here you can"
1510140,1514380," just start teaching programming like right away print alone you want to print something to the screen print"
1514380,1523340," so um yeah is it as easy as ruby sir i have no idea i see this language for the first time in my life"
1523340,1528460," why do you ask me like i know as much as you so um cool"
1530620,1536700," do we even have emacs support for this let's find out uh we do have vim though just in case what about"
1536700,1544220," what about emacs what about emacs emacs doesn't have it by default but maybe we can install it let's take a"
1544220,1547180," look at it"
1547180,1556540," okay groovy groovy groovy not groovy but groovy"
1556540,1563020," okay good so there is something there is something"
1566460,1571500," uh 72 stars uh 72 stars seriously groovy emacs modes"
1571500,1575580," so there is several of them"
1575580,1583900," okay so there's so many groovy emacs modes you need a whole fucking organization to"
1583900,1592300," to support them okay let's take a look at them uh i want to see all of the groovy modes please oh there's"
1592300,1597740," only one okay so it's an organization dedicated specifically to a single groovy"
1597740,1607260," oh it's actually okay there are several of them but they are located in a single reaper"
1607260,1615740," okay they're located in a single reaper uh oh yeah so the i heard that there is like several like"
1615740,1618460," dialects for groovy"
1618460,1622620," yeah i can see that emacs 24 plus"
1622620,1625420," holy i remember that one"
1625420,1634060," i was in uni i was still in university when emacs 24 was a thing these days we have like emacs 28 or"
1634060,1640220," something that's a very boomer emacs so it works in the very boomer emacs boomer emacs for a boomer language"
1641420,1643660," i kind of dig this language look at that it's actually"
1643660,1652940," maybe it is in fact a better java who knows we're about to find out we both find out um so where is"
1652940,1662380," my list of these things and uh groovy mode please install mr emacs 27.1 is the current one 27.2 is"
1662380,1667020," the around the corner 28 is in development but i had people talking about 28 so i thought maybe it's that"
1667020,1675900," that's the current one is this a worse java i don't know uh so far i it's better uh okay so"
1675900,1682220," it's better that it doesn't require like oh is there a worse java uh"
1682220,1686060," i don't know what could be worse than java"
1687020,1698940," kabbal is the worst java um not much to say because any other languages that mimic java"
1698940,1700220," they're usually better than java"
1700220,1709180," c sharp is definitely better than java holy i really like c sharp i think i think it was a cool language"
1710700,1716860," okay so let me open the oh there you go would you look at that would you look at that hello world"
1716860,1717340," support"
1717340,1725020," um okay so if i run emacs from within the development environment"
1725020,1728060," see sharp is better than yeah i can confirm that"
1728060,1736060," why is java bad who said that java bad who said that we're not talking about absolute willies we're"
1736060,1742140," talking about relative ones okay so can i do something like groovy main uh groovy is it going"
1742140,1747340," to work it's going to take some time so the iteration cycle is going to be quite slow but what kind of"
1747340,1756780," other utilities we even have there opt groovy uh a bin and this is not really what i wanted but um"
1757820,1771580," wait a second groovy c groovy sh okay uh first first of all groovy sh we have shell chat we have shell"
1771580,1780380," which is very slow by the way but i mean we do have it holy shit it's slow okay wait maybe it already"
1780380,1787340," started no it didn't start yet oh okay so it i think it's it's worse than scala and uh kotlin"
1787820,1795340," together but but but the evaluation is quite fast the evaluation is quite fast so um and we do have"
1795340,1802860," something called groovy c right groovy c so let's mean that it will compile our groovy program into the jvm"
1802860,1813740," bytecode look at that and then i can do something like main and uh couldn't find class main okay so which"
1813740,1823340," one okay it is not main apparently so java p uh how do you d d d d d d d disassemble i don't remember"
1823340,1831100," is it java yeah there we go uh it's called groovy length class main next okay"
1831100,1839500," huh huh huh huh it doesn't even have an entry point that's what's interesting about it"
1840380,1844620," yeah it doesn't have an entry like a pro oh here it is here's the entry point i i actually"
1844620,1852380," fucked up okay all right so but i don't think we're gonna uh we're gonna uh use it much yeah it still"
1852380,1858220," says main not found oh this is because it couldn't find this script because it inherent it extends the"
1858220,1865260," groovy length script so yeah you need a class path whatever we're probably not gonna use that anyway so uh"
1865260,1870300," we're probably gonna only run our program uh like this so i think it's it's this is sufficient enough"
1870300,1877980," class path yeah class path is in java is the biggest pain in the ass to be fair like holy um"
1877980,1884780," typical java experience yeah yeah typical java experience okay so maybe i'm gonna create a make file"
1884780,1892140," and uh we're gonna just have a test uh which is a phony target right it's just a phony target it's gonna be"
1892140,1898620," test it depends on main groovy uh and it's gonna also depend on a bunch of inputs and the inputs are"
1898620,1905820," gonna be what we're gonna have samples uh free samples txt we're gonna have a lot some numbers here"
1905820,1912300," 69 420 of course we need to add that those as well and we're gonna do groovy"
1913820,1922860," uh main groovy and also inputs there we go so if i try to uh just to make is it gonna do the trick is"
1922860,1934140," it gonna do the trick uh all right so uh let me let me see let me let me see and um how can we parse"
1934140,1940300," command line arguments groovy command uh line arts let's find out let's find out how to capture"
1940300,1952140," arguments pass to a groovy script that's a good question oh if you want more advanced parsing okay"
1952140,1958300," i like how this is like has low amount of upwards and accepted and is bigger and not accepted classical"
1958300,1963420," stack overflow by the way uh okay it's just literally called args so that means you can do"
1963420,1970780," something like args and then i can go here and it's probably gonna just give me the least of these"
1970780,1977500," arguments and it does contain a sample uh which is cool so the next thing i want to do i want to be able"
1977500,1985500," to uh do for each uh how to do for each in groovy uh the cool thing about this language is that it's"
1985500,1992460," popular right it is popular and there's a lot of information uh on the internet as simple as okay"
1992460,2001180," so i can do something like args uh and do each right so i have a key uh but i don't have to have a key"
2003420,2008140," all right so this looks weird like it's it's trying to be like functional and something but i think"
2008140,2018700," i'm gonna go with this one um oh it also has it has a dev keyword oh it is literally a python on jbm"
2018700,2026140," even though we i think we have a python and jvm json oh holy by the way is jathon a separate language"
2027820,2032700," can i use json as a separate language i mean um"
2032700,2040860," probably not because it's technically python it's just a python and jvm right so maybe i can't use"
2040860,2046540," that this i think it's gonna be a little bit a little bit cheating uh okay so if i do something"
2046540,2054300," like a print ln arg i like the simplicity of the syntax it's like it feels nice uh it's ergonomic"
2054300,2059340," scripted java with inspiration from python and ruby i i can see that that's actually cool okay how"
2059340,2071500," do you define a function or procedure groovy function groovy functions okay code maven you just do dev"
2073500,2081340," holy shit i like that def solve file and uh i might provide like a file path right so this is going to"
2081340,2092540," file path and uh solve file file path uh and uh we're going to print ln um is there a string interpolation"
2092540,2099820," yet again um groovy string interpolation let's find out you have tried to be like yes i have tried it"
2099820,2115980," uh to to to string interpolation interpol okay nice nice nice nice nice nice nice yes yes yes yes yes"
2115980,2122780," holy can we have something like that but not on jvm please"
2122780,2127260," uh okay"
2127260,2136700," okay so that's work nice nice nice hello i'm a robot welcome to the stream"
2138380,2145820," uh okay so um what's going to be the next one the next one is going to be uh reading the file right"
2145820,2150940," so groovy read the file is there like an easy way to read the file reading the file on groovy"
2150940,2158220," hello rookie avm hello that random tanker by the way hello hello everyone hello i'm sorry if i didn't"
2158220,2170060," say hello to all of you uh so you can okay that's very interesting using file for each all right this one"
2170060,2179340," is interesting can we use something like this um do we need to do like each line or maybe i can do something"
2179340,2187580," like like file uh path uh so here's the file and then uh each line is it gonna work is it gonna work"
2188220,2199900," uh and it does in fact work would you look at that uh okay uh groovy string i'm pretty sure you can"
2199900,2207660," do something like let me see like parse int because this is how you do that in java because it has like"
2207660,2214860," an interrupt between java so can i do something like this um should be able to do that right i don't remember"
2214860,2223500," if it's a parse int or something else and it is not percent okay um groovy parse int how do you parse an"
2223500,2242060," integer convert string to integer in groovy okay um two integer aha okay so it's gonna be something like two"
2242060,2250940," integer uh and we're gonna add 16 either of course and let's see the compilation times are beautiful"
2250940,2253180," okay it works"
2253180,2264620," that's pretty cool so i would say i can program in this language i can program in this language for sure for"
2264620,2271900," sure for sure so and i think i'm ready to read the description of the problem because yeah so i was i"
2271900,2278140," was just familiar familiarizing familiarizing myself with the language right so i discovered the main"
2278140,2283500," things that it'll probably need for like getting the information into the language and so on and so forth"
2283500,2291580," but maybe there's another thing i would like to do um like can i just iterate uh lines and stuff like that"
2292780,2301100," also i think this is more important can we have api uh documentation api documentation where is it"
2301100,2308860," uh groovy docs documentation on groovy api okay so what oh foolish it has like a javas"
2308860,2316300," okay that's that's nice that's very nice okay so can i find the file does it have a search anywhere here"
2316300,2323660," so maybe we can do something like this um in okay so it uses google to search okay sure um"
2323660,2333500," it's java io file isn't it but yeah but each line wait is each line a java thing as well java docs"
2335340,2340300," um yeah the java documentation is beautiful it's one of the reasons why it became a popular language"
2340300,2347740," right so because it's just so easy to to find any documentation like um i said it's easy to find any"
2347740,2356940," documentation okay so and this is like java uh seven can we have eight please uh which which is the current"
2356940,2360860," java by the way so i think i have java 13. so i'm gonna go with the java 13."
2360860,2368780," so we already found file okay so first i'm gonna take a look um um"
2368780,2375740," okay it didn't it didn't help it actually redirected to some um okay so where is the groovy"
2375740,2385100," groovy development i wish the stuff was easier to google up or search so somewhere in io right so we have to have"
2385100,2392140," i can't even click anywhere here unfortunately uh oh i saw groovy io but i missed it here it is so here is"
2392140,2403100," the groovy io um and the classes we don't even have classes here uh-huh so that it also gives you"
2403100,2410780," documentation for java io that's really strange uh how does that make any sense okay let me take a look"
2414380,2421820," well it's not really helpful so it accepts a closure and what is a closure a closure is also"
2421820,2428540," this is not helpful i need to i need a way to to find it myself um okay uh index maybe we can take a"
2428540,2438380," look at the index uh file so maybe i'll have to uh maybe i'll have to take a look at that"
2440140,2447420," oh oh oh it's slow oh it's slow like why can't you just have like a proper documentation"
2447420,2454140," it just parses all of these things and it's super slow and the commentation is just so bad"
2454140,2463580," i wish it would oh my god uh like i mean the search for the commutation is actually bad but um"
2468300,2476460," uh groovy groovy docs file how am i supposed to search anything am i supposed to use google"
2476460,2484540," apparently i supposed to use google okay holy uh that's that's bad uh that's very very bad uh the"
2484540,2490060," interface is so trashy anyway so let's take a look at the problem itself uh let's take a look at the"
2490060,2498540," problem itself so today we're solving the uh 20 second problem uh 20 second problem and again i"
2498540,2505660," haven't read the description of the problem yet so this is gonna be uh me reading it for the first time"
2505660,2513020," so and i'm keep in mind that i'm very stupid i'm extremely stupid so and also um you know java is my"
2513820,2521340," english is missing you see so i just confirmed the first statement anyway let's actually read it um"
2521340,2529260," okay uh crap combat holy i should have actually picked rust on that one yes rust is the perfect"
2529260,2536060," language for this problem unfortunately we already wasted rust um instant did that look like a criminal"
2536060,2548540," uh without the glasses hopefully i didn't know uh okay a crab combat um unfortunately rust we can't use"
2548540,2557500," us for this one uh it only takes a few hours of sailing at the ocean um on a raft for boredom to sink in"
2558220,2566540," uh unfortunately you brought a small deck of space cards uh okay so space cards uh let's see"
2566540,2582780," is that a cross reference is that it's it's a 2019 oh is that a cross reference do i have to know the"
2582780,2591660," like the whole lore of advent of code to understand this problem who knows who knows so a deck of space"
2591660,2599020," cards uh you'd like to play a game of combat uh we can click that i don't know what it is and there is"
2599020,2607020," even an opponent available a small crab that climbed a board you raft before you live that's a very depressing"
2607020,2613420," uh problem so far unfortunately it doesn't take long to teach the crap the rules well the rules are"
2613420,2620700," definitely very simple before the game starts split the cards so each player has their own deck your"
2620700,2628140," puzzle input uh then the game consists of series of rounds both players draw their top card and the"
2628140,2635100," player with the higher valued card wins the round the winner keeps both cards replacing them on"
2636300,2646540," um okay the player uh keeps both cards uh replacing them on the bottom of their own deck so that the"
2646540,2652220," winner cards is above the other card if this causes a player to have all of the cards they win and the"
2652220,2659980," game ends uh for example consider the following starting decks uh okay so this arrangement arrangement"
2659980,2668780," means the player one deck contains five cards with nine on top and uh one uh on the bottom player two deck"
2668780,2674940," also contains five cards with five on top and ten on the bottom the first round begins with both player"
2674940,2681180," drawing the top cards of their deck nine and five okay that's that makes sense nine and five player one"
2681180,2688300," has the higher card so both cards uh move to the bottom of the player one's deck such that nine uh is"
2688300,2696700," above five uh okay so nine five and uh all right the biggest like one goes to the top the first one begins"
2696700,2707100," the first one begins with both players drawing the top card to the uh okay in total it takes 29 rounds"
2707100,2713020," before a player has all of the cards okay this looks like very easy to simulate all right that's actually"
2713020,2722940," pretty cool um so every time he says deck i lose my shed are you on the toilet okay once the game"
2724380,2730860," once the game ends you can calculate the winning player's score the bottom cards in their deck is"
2730860,2734940," worth the value of the card multiplied by one um"
2734940,2747020," the bottom cards in their deck the bottom the single bottom in their deck is worth the value of the card"
2747020,2755660," multiplied by one why is okay the second from the is worst uh multiplied by two and so on with 10 cards"
2755660,2762940," uh top card is worth the value card multiplied by 10. scott def is gifting a tier one sub to her"
2762940,2770620," hearts and blots thank you scott def for uh supporting the channel and uh here hosts and plots welcome"
2770620,2776780," to epic advent of code club how about that how about that thank you thank you thank you all right"
2776780,2784380," a second uh okay multiply uh so this is the deck and we start from the bottom and uh this is the score"
2784380,2791980," so once the game ends the winning player score is uh 306 play the small crap in a game of combat using"
2791980,2801820," the two decks you just uh dealt uh what is the winning player score so far so good i guess so far so good"
2801820,2809820," you just simulate that and uh you know give it a score it's just a simulation i'm good at simulating"
2809820,2819420," things um all right let's take a look at the input how big is the input uh so i'm pretty sure the part"
2819420,2826460," two is going to be uh you know a little bit more difficult maybe i can imagine part two being uh find the"
2826460,2832700," arrangements of the cards for both players so the winner has the maximum available score so and that's"
2832700,2839740," already a little bit difficult to implement and um but i think with this amount of things you can still"
2839740,2847100," sort of simulate it so the amount of uh cards actually um is pretty small so i could imagine that the game"
2847100,2853100," will uh ask you to brute force all the possible combinations and define the combination that maximizes"
2853100,2859180," the uh the final score i could imagine this being a part two but again i never actually read this"
2859180,2863260," problem before and as you can see i didn't even solve it so i don't know what is the second part"
2863260,2867500," so but this like sounds like a plausible second part to be fair"
2869500,2875740," oh no rules um never read copper yes yes yeah i i just googled it before the stream uh and i already"
2875740,2885740," know the solution for everything sure uh okay so uh let's take a look at the sample all right well maybe"
2885740,2891900," we're gonna start with the sample because that's easier to uh deal with uh that's easier to deal with"
2892860,2902780," um so a sample is gonna be this shot uh boom so and then i'm gonna remove everything else and we already"
2902780,2908540," know how to parse these kind of lines so which is actually pretty cool uh and then we're gonna also"
2908540,2916060," uh put an input here so we're gonna have actually two samples here the input is pretty small uh i really"
2916060,2931180," like that cool um so yeah so how are we gonna do all of that uh we can try to parse the file um"
2931180,2941340," is there something like array list in a groovy groovy array list is that a thing uh so you have a list"
2941340,2949420," which is already pretty good um but it's an interface uh it's just an interface uh working"
2949420,2955420," with collections let's actually learn how to work with collections so you can define a list and you can"
2955420,2962700," just do do it oh you can literally do array list and that will work for you as well uh because array"
2962700,2967820," list is convenient because you can push into it right you can push into it and that's quite convenient"
2967820,2974300," so um can you define like structures or something like that groovy oh you can define classes that's"
2974300,2979500," for sure i'm pretty sure you can define classes object oriented groovy is object oriented by the"
2979500,2987420," way did you guys know that um okay so the thing i want to do uh oh and it accepts like types and"
2987420,2997500," shit is that really groovy yeah it is okay um so maybe i can do something like struct uh not in the"
2997500,3005420," struct but class uh bobject uh object oriented yes uh so this is going to be the input uh let's call them"
3005420,3015820," decks uh decks and uh it's going to be a list of strings um let's call them integers i suppose uh player one"
3015820,3020940," and this is going to be player two uh so let's see if it's gonna work"
3020940,3031100," if it's gonna work group eject oriented yes by the way hello the gorilla hello slightly old meme hello"
3031100,3034060," i use the deck to represent the deck"
3036700,3046140," well isn't that the pawn behind the deck i think i'm pretty sure like deck is like a double ended q and"
3046140,3052060," at the same time the name was chosen to actually yeah pronounced like deck it's like it's it's an"
3052060,3058540," intentional pun um i think but yeah it is quite funny and i think it is quite funny"
3058540,3063580," all right"
3063580,3073100," so this is the x and we can do something like parse file right we're gonna accept uh file path and i'm"
3073100,3079580," pretty sure i don't have to specify what this thing returns or anything uh i can do uh decks"
3079580,3087180," new decks my fingers are trying to type docker i i don't i don't even use docker what the"
3087180,3095180," fuck um okay i don't even use docker it's too close to do that uh do i have to do like semicolons or"
3095180,3105740," something pretty pretty sure i don't have to do that um so this is what we're gonna put here um and then um"
3107020,3114700," i'm gonna have def decks parse file file path there we go and then we're probably gonna have something"
3114700,3123660," like part one uh decks and i will be able to do something like uh part one and just print this"
3123660,3130140," beautiful thing there we go uh his alter ego uses docker i mean i use docker for hyper nerd"
3132940,3140940," so the one that is not both yes uh every time i change my hairstyle i become literally a different"
3140940,3160940," person um okay um the one that drinks coffee yes um so um here we parsing first we need to skip"
3162140,3164860," one line uh one line i think we need to skip one line"
3164860,3178460," there's not like easy way to skip one line um unless you have some sort of a variable right you"
3178460,3188140," have some sort of a variable that represents like a title uh right if title uh right we skip it and uh"
3189260,3209180," then we make it false uh otherwise um otherwise if uh line um is empty right we have to stop uh iterating the"
3209180,3215260," thing or something uh it would be easy okay can i just collect um this thing into a list can i collect"
3215260,3221900," um this thing into a list can i collect it into a list parsing it in an imperative way is actually quite"
3221900,3232540," painful groovy uh docs file uh so do you know how many of them here is there may be several dozens yes"
3235180,3241260," um each line um each line okay cool um can i do just lines"
3241260,3250380," read oh yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes read the lines"
3250380,3254780," and then i want to just print that and i'm pretty sure i should be able to print that"
3255500,3263020," uh cool let me see let me see it's probably not going to come out does this language inherit java's"
3263020,3271180," awful error messages yes of course of course it does um okay so here are these strings right and uh then"
3271180,3276940," it failed because no signature method is applicable something something uh because i didn't even have a"
3276940,3283260," method called part one right so it's going to be part one and we accept dx that's what we're doing we accept"
3283260,3293420," decks cool um so not actually better than java yes"
3298780,3304860," uh so what's next uh now let's take a look at the lists let's take a look at the lists uh what can"
3304860,3312140," we do with the lists so it actually redirects to here and is it possible to split the list splittery"
3319100,3330300," they have a class called splitterator okay for traversing partition elements of a source"
3330300,3342620," and wall of text of course without any examples like really like who do they expect"
3342620,3346220," you're gonna read all of that but maybe some people do i don't know maybe"
3349100,3358140," uh so i want to take a look splitterator oh my god and it resets to the beginning"
3358140,3367900," it resets to the beginning it's reset to the beginning but maybe that's okay maybe that's okay"
3367900,3374780," because it will make it easier for me to um skip all of that"
3379660,3387100," maybe it will make it easier for me to skip um so groovy split list maybe groovy actually how to"
3387100,3391340," split the list into a call says listen good okay maybe groovy has something convenient for that"
3391340,3400140," because obviously in java it's a little bit painful uh partition count times okay you can do something like"
3400140,3411420," something like that um and what is the method you use you do that uh array size partition times"
3411420,3416540," okay uh groovy list api"
3416540,3420860," interface list"
3425180,3431180," split split split elements into two collections based on the closure condition okay"
3431180,3439820," okay so that's actually pretty cool uh then um"
3439820,3442940," split"
3446700,3456220," or you can even do something like that heat oh it has it like um like cotton yeah like like cotton it"
3456220,3463900," equal uh this thing empty is it gonna give us something something better i think it will give us"
3463900,3465900," something there uh"
3465900,3469340," okay"
3471500,3476220," huh huh so it didn't work right so it definitely didn't work"
3476220,3489900," i wonder why though so uh maybe it's because it has to be something like length"
3489900,3492700," equal zero but maybe we also have to trim it"
3496140,3506940," uh maybe we have to trim it ah i see okay i see what it is split do we have any other splits in here"
3506940,3517260," yeah okay so it actually separates okay i see so for for the true one it goes into i i see there's no"
3517260,3522780," more convenient way to do that collate i don't know what that word means though so that's probably why i"
3522780,3527900," i didn't think about it uh collate"
3527900,3534700," okay"
3534700,3539180," maybe"
3539180,3550380," okay let's uh whatever so maybe i should stop like trying to do all these things and just you know"
3550380,3551980," implement everything like myself"
3551980,3560220," at least we can start like uh iterating the lines and it's not going to be that different uh from"
3560220,3561740," this but i can do something like this"
3561740,3567820," um i can have the current uh the current line"
3567820,3574460," so something like index and initially it's going to be actually one"
3575260,3583980," and uh while um lines index i hope it's going to work by the way uh index is like a length"
3583980,3590780," greater than zero we are collecting all of that into the uh decks player one"
3591420,3595100," uh i think it's going to be like push lines index"
3595100,3602540," uh what was that two integer i think it was two integer uh something like this and we have to"
3602540,3609260," increment it so maybe we can do it like four is there like a classical four thingy uh maybe it doesn't"
3609260,3620140," matter so then i can do uh plus one um is it uh probably not um okay so once we parse this thing i"
3620140,3625980," also think we need to return the decks uh but maybe not return but just print a land we're going to print"
3625980,3627180," land for now um"
3630300,3636540," hello upon a body welcome to the stream how are you doing uh can it evoke method push so what is"
3636540,3645020," the least uh what is the method to push into the list push it's literally called push very interesting"
3645020,3654620," so this is the least and i cannot push it into it kind of appreciate on the null object"
3656380,3664060," really don't okay uh so do i have to do something like um maybe i can do something like this um"
3664060,3669420," can you do something like this it's a jvm language yeah i keep forgetting about that"
3669420,3675020," keep forgetting about that okay so and it didn't really print anything nice one um"
3675020,3681820," okay maybe i can overload like two string for it to print anything but uh"
3682940,3696220," would be would be nice to have that um yeah groovy override uh to string yeah it's essentially it has"
3696220,3706780," the same problem as um as java because it's jvm language classical jvm language uh so object meta"
3707660,3713580," or you can literally do it like that so it's even compatible with the syntax like of java you can"
3713580,3721580," probably even grab some java things and uh just paste them in groovy and use them um okay so this one"
3721580,3729580," is going to be something like um string to string and of course it has to be overwritten override and um"
3730540,3737980," i think we're gonna just return something like this uh player uh one and maybe we're gonna put it like"
3737980,3744540," that uh player two and i'm pretty sure like the two string for lists is already okay"
3744540,3753100," all the java code is a valid group oh interesting so it's like a super super set of java oh there you go"
3753100,3757260," it's kind of it kind of worked uh so if i take a look at the sample um"
3757260,3774220," it's actually okay it pushed it uh okay it pushed it at the front is there any way to push that at the"
3774220,3775580," back um"
3775580,3782380," is there like a c really add"
3782380,3789820," why didn't they call them push back and push front why do you have to memorize that"
3789820,3795500," push it at the front and add at the end like how does it make any sense this is really a bad naming"
3795500,3801020," but i mean i probably programmed uh yeah simon i already forgot everything i already forgot everything"
3801020,3804540," about java i'm sorry so uh it's at okay"
3804540,3813580," uh cool we're getting there chat we're getting there don't worry about it okay so that that's a"
3813580,3820780," good one um so once it becomes equal to that uh i'll have to do something like this and uh i'm pretty"
3820780,3829020," sure i don't even need this kind of thing and i need to repeat all of that uh up until i suppose index"
3831020,3838060," is less than lines length right and we're gonna push that into the second one and let's see if it's"
3838060,3843580," gonna work or not just use the dove somewhere and then it's not the java anymore yes it literally"
3843580,3854300," becomes python and no signature method array length uh is it size uh is it size probably size it's probably"
3854300,3856460," size hello mustafen hello hello"
3856460,3871020," okay and i forgot that i actually have to step two steps because the player two because of z player two"
3875660,3882780," okay cool uh we parsed both of them nice it took it took an hour to parse to parse these things but we"
3882780,3891740," managed to do that anyway so um i'm really proud of myself by the way cool uh and now in here so actually"
3891740,3900060," you're supposed to return this thing and um just grew you waving yes um why are you still in part one"
3900060,3906380," because i'm dumb i'm sorry i'm not really good at this advent of code thinking just use mesh shaders"
3906380,3914620," yeah that was that would solve everything okay so now we need to simulate right um now we need to simulate"
3915900,3926140," so we look at the top and um you can use instead of add cool i didn't know that it's it's almost like c"
3926140,3934540," plus plus it's almost like c plus plus or mine got okay um so let's implement the function called simulate"
3936060,3947660," like a game like simulate game and it will accept the decks uh right so and uh we're going to simulate the"
3947660,3959500," game um and we will have to return the winner score like the winner score uh decks and we can just return"
3959500,3968460," that it's going to be separate thing winner score with decks so essentially it will just look at the um"
3968460,3975740," you know at the one that is empty um so um but we can implement that a little bit later can i assert"
3975740,3983100," things uh okay i can actually assert things i can do false when uh not implemented and can i do something"
3983100,3989660," like this here as well and let's just try to run it uh yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep"
3989660,3999980," and unexpected really i have no opportunity to um"
4005580,4011980," it's a colon it's a java as a remember wait colon"
4011980,4018780," do i did if i get something about java assert"
4018780,4033100," don't you add a statement i add statements every day believe it or not um"
4035580,4037900," i forgot about that actually"
4037900,4048620," it's a really strange okay cool so um all right completely forgot about this one sure"
4048620,4062140," uh not implemented so let's see if it's if the same syntax i mean yeah if groovy is a super"
4062140,4070780," set of java that should work a super set and yes it worked beautiful uh as you can see it says not"
4070780,4079180," implemented nice i didn't use a certain java ever this is because you don't program in java right um"
4079740,4093660," okay while um i would say decks uh player uh one size is not equal to zero and uh player player one and"
4093660,4100860," the size of the second player also not equal to that right we take a look at their uh dx"
4103740,4111260," decks player player one so and uh if this is so are they ever equal"
4111260,4119980," okay doesn't matter we can put an assertion there um"
4119980,4130620," decks player two uh zero if they are greater uh can you do elif else if no it has to be done like that"
4131340,4136780," and the other condition is gonna be did you manage to solve part two yesterday yes i managed to solve"
4136780,4142540," a part two by the way hello welcome to the stream hello hello everyone who just joined recently so"
4142540,4148060," actually solving part two is super is super easy if you figure out part one they are very related to"
4148060,4153100," each other so once you solve part one of the yesterday's problem like part two is just like an"
4153100,4165340," extension of part one um all right they're not ever equal because either player one or player two gets"
4165340,4176300," seven cards etc it doesn't really confirm anything uh in my opinion at least so is that and here uh we're"
4176300,4183420," going to put the following thing is going to be assert false uh unreachable state of the game so i'm"
4183420,4189180," not going to handle that situation i'm going to just uh throw an assertions in this uh case and if this"
4189180,4196700," ever happens well only then we're going to investigate why until it happens whatever uh whatever whatever"
4196700,4207660," uh so and now i need a way to remove the card uh from the um from the player right so you can do pop"
4207660,4213980," right remove the initial item from the list this is similar to pop uh on the stack where the first"
4215740,4219180," the initial you mean the first one"
4219180,4231260," who calls the first element of collection initial item who on verse does that"
4231260,4241180," the initial okay well yeah i'm forced to write java oh my god my condos"
4245740,4256380," um the one you initialized with um um all right cool and that's probably what we want to do here right"
4256380,4269100," so um it's gonna be a uh b so it's gonna be dex player one uh pop and then the second one um right"
4270780,4279740," and the biggest goal first right the biggest goal above right so this is not and then it goes like"
4279740,4288460," that uh goes yeah the biggest goes first so then uh what we have to do here so the player one one"
4288460,4296540," and it's gonna be player one uh add so a is the biggest one uh maybe we're gonna call them"
4297180,4305660," we'll call them a1 and a2 so uh it's a little bit easier for me to comprehend uh a2 cool"
4305660,4317980," to be fair i can probably simplify this entire stuff by making them like that so this is gonna be just a1"
4318860,4332540," uh this is gonna be a2 and in here yeah yeah so this one is gonna be as well a1 a2 it's gonna be tech"
4332540,4342300," player two add a2 a1 so this is how it's gonna go uh and i guess that's it like i didn't see anything"
4342300,4351900," special here just you know the usual thing uh the usual thing um and we can try to simulate the game"
4351900,4359980," um let's just return 69 for now and after simulation i can try to print the decks just to confirm that"
4359980,4368460," we simulated everything correctly who's casco it's one of those mathematicians the famous mathematician no"
4368460,4375180," such property deck for class main um where exactly that happened please can i can i see"
4375180,4384140," ah because it's called the decks not a single deck but decks yeah haskell govnik yes i know that one"
4384140,4386460," haskell govnik"
4390220,4400860," nice so um that's really interesting so who won uh the player two won and i think it's like equal"
4400860,4408300," exactly to that i think we managed to simulate that i think we managed to simulate that and uh vivon yes"
4408300,4418620," and um we just need to uh do a winner score so this is how we're gonna do the decks player uh one"
4419340,4425340," length equals zero we're gonna return decks player one otherwise we're gonna return decks player two"
4425340,4432140," and uh we're gonna just introduce the deck so this could be something like this"
4432140,4439980," it doesn't even allow me okay is that how i do that i guess this is how i'm gonna do that"
4439980,4446940," um and we need to iterate from from the right right we need to iterate from the right"
4449340,4457340," i'm gonna do that well is there opposite of pop um is there opposite of pop that remove i think"
4457340,4465020," it's it should be called remove um do you have something like remove you do have something like"
4465020,4478140," remove but where is it um remove it one remove last okay removing first is called pop removing last is"
4478140,4486380," called remove last i think i do not regret actually not using java anymore to be fair i'm sorry if it was"
4486380,4498780," too loud um okay um so uh this is gonna be the results so what essentially we're doing i think i'm gonna start"
4498780,4509340," by having like n as the size of the deck so this is gonna be the size of the deck and uh for yeah"
4509340,4515500," yeah you should be able to do things like this uh size thank you thank you thank you i keep forgetting"
4515500,4524060," about that um we have to iterate it like this by the way excuse me and uh result"
4524060,4536780," uh is going to be plus i multiply jack remove last uh cool that's that's the whole thing and then we can"
4536780,4547260," return a result then we can return a result uh we don't need to print anything here and uh what do we"
4547260,4562860," have what we have 306 306 how about that and it is a 306 so uh the next thing is going to be uh make"
4562860,4566620," file it's going to be sample input txt and let's see"
4566620,4578140," yeah so in haskell it would be way easier i do agree with that 35 397 okay so are you guys ready are you"
4578140,4585660," guys ready oh nice first mother flipping trying how about that who's that god cooter"
4585660,4595020," uh so a part two uh holy okay so i think i need to pee first before i go into the part two"
4595020,4605260," um one star death all right so uh let's make a small break i first i first need to google how"
4605260,4611820," to solve the second part i didn't google it before the stream um so let me well let's do a two minutes"
4611820,4621980," break uh and then once i googled up the solution we can continue uh okay so all right let's make a small"
4621980,4632540," break and you guys have fun"
4632540,4634540," so"
4634540,4636540," so"
4636540,4640540," so"
4640540,4644540," so"
4644540,4655100," so"
4655100,4659100," so"
4659100,4665100," so"
4665100,4677660," you"
4695100,4709660," so"
4709660,4738780," yo what's up epic gamers how's it going i'm back to back okay part two um"
4739660,4740780," you lost to the small"
4740780,4748860," lost to a crab how about that have you found the solution yes of course i i know how to solve the"
4748860,4754700," second part don't worry about it uh lost to a crab fortunately crabs aren't very good at the"
4754700,4761820," recursion to defend your owner as a raft captain you challenge a small craft to a game of recursive"
4761820,4762940," combat holy"
4763580,4768540," recursive combat still starts by splitting the cards into two decks you offer to play with the"
4768540,4775980," same starting decks as before it's only fair then the game consists of a series of rounds with a few"
4775980,4784540," changes okay before either player deals a card if there was a previous round in this game that had"
4784540,4792220," exactly the same cards in the same order in the same player decks the game instantly ends"
4792220,4797340," in a win for player one what does it mean i don't understand what that means"
4797340,4804940," if there was a previous round so a single round is basically drawing a card right so let me understand"
4804940,4813420," what is a round so yeah a single round it's a draw okay cool uh there was a previous round in the game"
4813420,4820220," that had exactly the same cards in the same order in the same player's decks the game instantly ends in"
4820220,4826460," a win for player one previous rounds for other games are not considered uh this prevents infinite"
4826460,4832700," games of recursive combat which everyone agrees is a bad idea okay otherwise this rounds cards must be in"
4832700,4839020," in a new configuration the players begin the round by each drawing the top cards of their deck as normal"
4839020,4843980," if both players have at least as many cards remaining in their decks as the values of the"
4843980,4849260," card they just drew the winner of the round is determined by playing a new game of recursive combat"
4849260,4854700," see below otherwise uh at least one player must not have enough cards left in their deck"
4854700,4861820," to uh recurs the winner of the round in uh the player with the higher value card i didn't understand"
4861820,4873580," like what the are you trying to tell me um so um series of rounds with a few changes before i had the"
4873580,4881100," player deal the card if there was a previous round in this game that had exactly the same card okay"
4887500,4894620," reading puzzle again yeah it's it's a reading puzzle yet again as in regular combat so uh the winner of"
4894620,4901900," the round if they won the round by winning the sub game takes the two cards okay as a regular the winner"
4901900,4908460," so you you have sub games essentially so we have a game and then you have a sub game uh that's why it's"
4908460,4914380," recursive and then so you basically when you start the sub game you put the previous one on the stack and the"
4914380,4920700," previous one on the stack and then once you finish a sub game you return back and uh okay so that's very"
4920700,4927260," interesting uh so the winner of the round if they won the round by winning sub game takes the two cards"
4927260,4937740," dealt um the winner of the round even if they won the round by winning a sub game takes the both cards dealt at"
4937740,4943500," the beginning of the round and places them on top of their own deck again so that the winner card is above the"
4943500,4950300," the other card not that the winner's card might be the lower value of two cards um not that the winner's"
4950300,4956700," card might be the lower value of the two cards if they won the round you to win in a sub game if you"
4956700,4963020," okay if connecting us by winning the round causes a player to have all of the cards they win and the"
4963020,4969340," game ends here is example of small game that would loop forever without infinite game prevention loop"
4973340,4978140," uh"
4978140,4983660," and there is this wall of text okay"
4983660,4991980," during the round of recursive combat if both players have at least as many cards as their own"
4991980,4996620," decks as the number of the cards they just dealt the winner of them"
5000540,5007660," holy what do you want from me um for example if player one draws the player three the player two"
5007660,5013660," draws the seven card they would occur with player one i like i don't understand what what this means"
5013660,5019020," to play some game recursive each player creates a new deck by making a copy of the next cards and their"
5019020,5024620," decks the quantity maybe i shouldn't read that because this is not helpful at all maybe i just look into the"
5024620,5033900," example because holy um okay so here is uh the decks for the player one um"
5038620,5046460," oh so i thought the example is gonna be like this one but this is actually previous example wait a second"
5049580,5053580," like why do you show that example and you don't show a lock for for that one but then you show"
5053580,5061100," this is so bad holy fuck uh okay so maybe for me to understand i just need to trace this example"
5061740,5071500," but it's really really bad okay game one so you uh the player one wins the round of the game one um"
5071500,5077580," okay one two players uh around of the game two"
5077580,5084940," uh-huh the game one the game two game one"
5086300,5091420," uh okay player sub game to determine the winner okay four three so that means we had a four three"
5091420,5099820," somewhere at some point no we didn't so that means i don't understand what they want from me um"
5099820,5109660," so i still don't understand when do we start to play a sub game because uh okay so let's see"
5112540,5117580," we have at least as many cards remaining there as the value okay at least"
5117580,5121580," as many cards"
5121580,5125740," okay so this is six"
5125740,5128540," both"
5128540,5134620," why didn't we play this sub game in this case then"
5134620,5138700," holy it's so bad okay"
5140860,5145500," before the player did the cut if there was a previous round in this game that had exactly the"
5145500,5148060," same cards in the same order in the same player's decks"
5148060,5154620," the game instantly ends in in aware of player one previous rounds from other games are not considered"
5154620,5160060," this prevents infinite uh games or caution combat this round card must be in a new configuration"
5162940,5169260," a new configuration play beginning round by each drawing top okay if both players have at least as many at least"
5169260,5172380," as many cards"
5182860,5188860," as the values as the values that they just drew"
5188860,5195980," otherwise at least one player must not have uh cards okay um"
5195980,5198300," i"
5198300,5199500," uh all right"
5199500,5201980," so"
5204140,5210940," so i need to understand why in each of these cases we don't play the next round"
5210940,5216380," so you have the player one has six cards"
5216380,5223820," four three okay"
5226780,5231740," uh uh huh all right so we're playing the sub game"
5231740,5235500," and sub game continues when"
5235500,5246220," okay the sub game continues there and we're playing a simple sub game and it basically restores"
5247100,5253260," the state at which we started this thing so it basically restores the state at which started um"
5253260,5255500," okay"
5255500,5262300," all right so this is the third one"
5262300,5267980," and uh uh-huh game four"
5270220,5275260," the winner player wins uh uh uh round three"
5275260,5286300," post game results after the game uh the winning player score is calculated for uh from the cards"
5286300,5292380," they have in their original decks using the same rule as a regular combat in above game the winner"
5292380,5299340," player score is to uh nine one defining owner as a raft captain by playing the small crab"
5299900,5303980," in the game of the castle currently using the same two decks as before what is the winning player's"
5303980,5305820," score um"
5305820,5314620," all right so i need to read the uh"
5314620,5320220," this thing one more time essentially it's basically that but you"
5320220,5322300," recurs"
5322300,5328460," the simulate game that's it actually"
5329580,5333980," yeah you you basically at some point you're gonna have like a condition somewhere here"
5333980,5339900," additional condition uh where you're gonna just you know do that and maybe something like"
5339900,5348220," it was not intentional i'm sorry uh something like like a clone right so where you're gonna clone"
5348220,5354540," it so it doesn't modify uh the original decks and then you're gonna go back and check with us whoever"
5354540,5362620," uh whoever uh whoever won right so uh that's basically the solution right but the problem is that uh i"
5362620,5369020," don't understand the rules so once i understand the rules i can probably implement it in this particular"
5369020,5374300," fashion and it should work that's yeah that's the gist of it but but then the main puzzle here is"
5374300,5380060," then to understand what the fuck do you want from me ah i don't understand that at some point has to"
5380060,5386220," recurse into the next game into sub game but parsing what the fuck is the author is trying to tell us"
5386220,5393500," it's just pain in the ass holy oh my god this is so bad all right let's make a cup of tea now about that"
5395180,5398620," imagine dude this is very good at english well i mean i'm not good at english"
5398620,5410780," all right does anyone have any questions or maybe uh you know you have something to say to me feel"
5410780,5420620," free to do that right now while i'm making a cup of tea so there we go uh yeah how do you guys like"
5420620,5428700," advent of code so far how do you like advent of code so far uh is anyone still participating in it i know"
5428700,5431820," jean is still participating uh is anyone else participating"
5431820,5437740," thank you i really appreciate"
5437740,5440780," uh"
5440780,5447180," day one and two are pretty good i see well they're not bad that's for sure"
5447740,5453740," i'm running out of royal grave unfortunately i'm running out of royal grave i'll have to at some"
5453740,5466220," point um go groceries again and buy more oral grave um doing 23 at the moment uh please no spoilers i"
5466220,5473340," didn't read uh 23 yet so i've been using it to learn haskell cool"
5476460,5480620," do you like haskell so far the earl of gray"
5480620,5488460," okay whereas i'm tempted to start a restart from day one but in c i've been doing in c plus plus"
5488460,5494140," interesting so you want an extra challenge or are you done with c plus plus stuff"
5499900,5501180," the bag is weird"
5501180,5510220," you are weird okay so i'm gonna go to kitchen and turn on my kettle and then i go back and we can"
5510220,5519580," continue trying to understand the rules um i'm just done with c plus plus i see so yeah i also like"
5519580,5526140," simplicity of c compared to c plus part but i would still have some you know static type like compile time"
5526140,5543580," uh type related features and see this is something close to templates i don't know"
5544300,5574140," uh hello j s j s it was actually pretty good when i used it for advent of code problem um i came yes"
5574300,5584460," before i the player deals a card if there was a previous round in this game that had exactly the"
5584460,5591420," same cards in the same order in the same player's decks the game instantly ends i understand what they're"
5591420,5604380," trying to do so if i can understand what they're trying to say so essentially if the state of the game"
5604380,5615020," repeats at any point stop the game that's what they're trying to say this state why couldn't you tell okay"
5615020,5620460," so maybe that it would be spore in that case it would be too easy to understand if the state of the game"
5620460,5627500," repeats at any point stop the game because you will go into recursion because yeah if at any point in the"
5627500,5634460," next state of the game you will go into sub game it will just repeat itself forever okay thank you i"
5634460,5642060," understand now uh yeah it's it's audio technical something something it's actually pretty good you know"
5643100,5651740," ratio of price and quality otherwise this round uh cards must be in a new configuration okay so the only"
5651740,5660060," thing i need to do i need to just go for a walk uh and uh yeah okay so it reset my brain um"
5663020,5672300," i don't know if i can get back to the game i have two laptops i uh i keep one laptop laptop in the"
5672300,5678300," kitchen so just in case i can i can google something uh otherwise this round cards must be in a new"
5678300,5687340," configuration the player's card begin the round by each drawing the top card of their deck as normal if both"
5687340,5698460," players have at least as many cards remaining in their decks as the values at least so that means the uh"
5700220,5707340," amount of remaining cards should be greater or equal than the value that they drew"
5707340,5713980," so if they have at least so it has to be greater or equal all right"
5717820,5725900," okay cool you see googling the solution actually helps to understand everything right right um all"
5725900,5733820," right otherwise at least one player must not uh have enough cards left in their deck um otherwise at"
5733820,5739900," least one player must not have enough cards in their deck to recurse the winner of the round is the player"
5739900,5753900," with the higher value card all right all right at least one player must not have enough card left in"
5753900,5768380," their deck to recurse cool cool cool so you drew nine so um you have four and you have four we cannot"
5768380,5775420," recurse you have two and eight so you have five you have greater but this one doesn't have enough cards"
5775420,5783820," to recurse so uh six and four you have four you can no you cannot you can but the other way cannot the"
5783820,5794060," other the other one cannot uh three uh but the other one cannot recurse yeah uh oh playing a sub game to"
5794060,5801340," determine the winner determine the winner and we constantly have to keep track of the state uh have"
5801340,5808860," we seen that state before so and since the state is actually quite easy we can just put that into"
5808860,5816300," into the set right we can put it into the set and we can just keep track of that thinking in the set um"
5817740,5823740," okay we just need to implement that just need to implement that simple as that"
5823740,5830620," simple as that how do you clone objects in java i remember that java clone objects right"
5832780,5837980," um taiwan ago is to be honest oh why am i reading a deep copy"
5837980,5853100," i need to perform deep copy of an object may even set up yes of course you cannot"
5853100,5857820," deep copy an object without a maven set up that's for sure uh"
5857820,5872140," okay you can clone them and stuff okay uh so that means at some point i should be able to clone"
5872140,5880060," decks and that should work that should work okay so this is the part one um and i'm going to introduce"
5880060,5888220," the uh part part two just save it as jason alone to another copy that's a good idea cozy white bear"
5888220,5892220," by the way hello cozy white bear welcome to our epic groovy stream"
5892220,5898300," fucking groovy stream i think my my kettle is ready so i'm gonna go back google a little bit more"
5898300,5912460," and then we can start implementing everything yes i just need another round of googling"
5912460,5940460," hello hello hello um so yeah i've got the tea i've got the tea"
5940460,5948300," uh are you fucking ready chat are you fucking ready i want to test something super quick"
5948300,5957820," um square wave incoming ip this is a very like scary message to be fair from the boat"
5957820,5960220," square wave incoming ip isn't joking"
5961740,5970140," uh all right so i'm gonna do print ln uh part two uh and it's gonna be a part two"
5970140,5974780," dex uh and in the part two"
5974780,5979020," part two uh dex"
5979020,5985820," what we're gonna do i want to try something interesting so essentially i'm gonna have a copy"
5986540,5992940," copy of dex i think this is not how we're supposed to do that in a java world this is how we do that"
5992940,5998700," i'm gonna just clone it right uh and i'm gonna print a land both of them both of them so it's gonna be"
5998700,6002780," dex uh copy of dex"
6002780,6005580," uh"
6005580,6012540," tax studio what is tax studio never heard of it"
6012540,6018700," um is that for later or something it sounds like something for a letter"
6019420,6020940," yeah it is something for water"
6020940,6028700," oh never heard of it uh when i was using later i was just doing that in emacs so i never needed that"
6028700,6029580," do you even have that"
6031980,6034220," is it good is it good"
6034220,6039980," oh yeah i do have that"
6039980,6052060," i'm gonna check it out after after the game bro after the game um okay it's a blot 22 megabytes i mean"
6052060,6060060," it's not that much come on it's not that much um okay so that didn't work uh an illegal reflective"
6060060,6065980," access operation has occurred illegal reflective access"
6065980,6070060," clone not supported exception dex"
6070060,6078940," clone not supported exception dex"
6081420,6084220," that's a very good"
6084220,6100780," i think uh it's the time has come for a little bit of a tsmr chat are you guys ready for a little bit of a tsmr"
6104620,6108140," so here is my tea here is my team"
6108140,6125980," there we go so it's not fully actually came out you have to do something like and now it should be able to"
6126620,6128140," fully okay"
6128140,6147420," my hands are too weak for this apparently okay cool so uh yeah let's let's let's continue so the content uh has to go on"
6152300,6155980," all right um let's see"
6155980,6158220," caught"
6158220,6162620," how can we prevent that"
6162620,6165660," this is gonna send me to the bathroom"
6165660,6169020," yes that was the entire intent"
6172700,6174380," oh"
6174380,6175980," why is this code animated"
6175980,6179420," uh"
6179420,6182620," do i have to implement clone myself i think that's what i need to do"
6182620,6187500," um"
6187500,6191100," class dex implement clonable"
6192140,6192700," um"
6192700,6192860," um"
6192860,6194780," i forgot how to"
6194780,6200380," uh implementing clonable and declaring okay so they probably have to implement like clonable or something like really"
6200380,6203420," i forgot this part of java"
6203420,6204860," i forgot about it"
6204860,6214380," you're not getting a clone exception you're getting an error from the compiler that says the scene school method throws a clone not supported exception you need to either catch"
6215340,6216220," uh okay"
6216220,6221100," cloneable requires no it so you can just implement it for free okay"
6221100,6222220," um"
6222220,6223580," all right"
6223580,6225420," implements"
6225420,6227740," cloneable"
6227740,6230300," is it cloneable"
6230300,6232620," is it it is cloneable"
6232620,6236300," um i want to also uh do cloneable"
6236300,6238220," clone able"
6238220,6243740," let's let's read about it holy i forgot everything about java there's like i'm almost like learning it from scratch"
6244460,6245580," um"
6245580,6247580," class implements the cloneable first to indicate"
6247580,6255180," to the object method that it is legal for that method to make a field for field copy of an instances of that class"
6255180,6257020," as a fake"
6257020,6263500," it was very long time ago come on uh since then i actually tried and programmed in so many different languages"
6263500,6265500," it's insane"
6265500,6267500," it's insane how many different languages i tried"
6267500,6269660," it's not free"
6269660,6270540," uh"
6270540,6272540," okay we'll see"
6273740,6274060," okay"
6274060,6278380," uh illegal reflective access operation has occurred"
6278380,6284460," use illegal access one to enable warnings for further illegal reflective access"
6284460,6285340," um"
6287980,6290700," or please consider reporting this to the maintenance of the"
6290700,6293340," code house groovy"
6293340,6294140," ah"
6294140,6299900," i see so that's really interesting so they're trying to use something that is going to be deprecated soon"
6302940,6307340," um all right and uh this looks very interesting"
6307340,6311260," and it didn't really print anything because"
6313580,6315260," uh"
6315260,6320540," yeah so actually part one consumes"
6320540,6322060," okay i see"
6322060,6327740," uh okay we can do something like this we can actually clone this entire thing then"
6328540,6332460," and every time we pass it we're gonna clone but so yeah we're passing by value"
6332460,6339500," why would they work for jet brains i mean do you even have like jet brains offices in your country"
6339500,6340380," i don't know"
6340380,6345660," i don't i don't know uh and it didn't really work that's really strange"
6345660,6356700," no anything okay because yeah i think to work for jet brains you have to be in either russia or europe"
6356700,6360700," because that's the main that's where the main offices are um"
6360700,6366620," because java is getting deprecated"
6366620,6376940," imagine actually the oracle slowly deprecates uh the whole language feature by feature without"
6376940,6382620," adding new features until there is no language left and the entire java code base disappeared"
6382620,6383980," how awesome would that be"
6385340,6389580," that's a really interesting way to like erase the language from the history of humanity like"
6389580,6391740," start deprecating it feature by feature"
6391740,6398220," so and enforce people to adapt the resource code to that"
6398220,6404220," um what about using zig tomorrow no we're not using zig"
6404220,6408380," i already talked about that um"
6408380,6414300," already talked about that and you completely miss that conversation"
6415340,6421660," okay so cloning this didn't really work for some reason i didn't understand why"
6421660,6424860," okay so let's try something like this"
6424860,6426620," um"
6426620,6434060," fun fact we use a method from oracle that is deprecated at work that has no substitute"
6434060,6440700," i can imagine that i can imagine that because it's a classical jvm situation especially with like"
6440700,6447100," unsafe class right do you guys know the situation with the unsafe class and jvm it was actually quite some time ago"
6447100,6456860," yeah it was quite some time ago um and essentially there was a class that would"
6457500,6465020," um people use to speed their uh the programs up uh but it was completely undocumented and it was like"
6465020,6470940," internal thingy but people still depend on it and like sun and oracle for the longest time tried"
6470940,6477180," to make people not use that class because it could be changed at any point uh and i think at some point"
6477180,6483420," they finally removed it from the public interface completely so it's not available anymore uh yeah"
6483420,6489180," starting i light you need to overwrite clone yeah i think i think you need to do that and you have to"
6489180,6496540," like create a new instance and stuff like that uh but you still need to implement clonable i think i"
6496540,6509260," think you still need to do that and what's the how do you do that it has to return an object but"
6509260,6517180," do i have to return an object as well i think i think i have to return an object as well can i just return"
6517180,6529500," decks uh i need a tutorial java clonable tutorial show me an example object cloning and java a java point"
6529500,6539020," what the hell is this shit monkey tos uh all right yeah you have to return this thing so you also have"
6539020,6552940," to clone super um yeah yeah you have to do that and i wonder if it's gonna do that i wonder um"
6552940,6562380," can be covariance maybe i'm about to find out there's gonna be the throws we have overwrite that"
6562380,6568940," means the compiler or the runtime will tell us that we're doing something wrong uh throws uh no"
6569020,6573820," clone support exception okay so that's exactly what we're gonna do here and we're gonna try to"
6573820,6578540," return super and i feel like it's not gonna actually work because maybe we'll also have"
6578540,6583820," to clone these things separately but maybe we don't have to do that um we'll see we'll see"
6583820,6592300," so take some time okay it didn't really fail uh"
6592300,6598540," yeah you have to clone the list yourself so what i'm thinking is that maybe i just have to"
6599660,6612140," you know do something like results create the new decks and then result player uh player one player one"
6612140,6617420," clone uh i think that's uh sure"
6617420,6628140," uh and i'm not even sure this needs to be done like that is that how i do that do i need to clone the super"
6628140,6632460," object i don't think i need to do that i don't think i need to do that"
6632460,6639660," okay so and now if i do something like this"
6639660,6646300," it's uh will actually work for all of them hopefully"
6646300,6657980," okay so it did in fact work so we are working with the copies and now uh i want to truly check this thing so"
6657980,6671660," um i'm gonna have a copy of decks decks uh decks clone right and uh yeah after i did a copy i'm gonna do"
6671660,6679660," copy one player one and i'm gonna add a bunch of 69s there right and then i'm gonna try to print them"
6679660,6686140," again and then the copy and just confirm that decks was not modified and everything was cloned correctly"
6686140,6694940," everything was cloned correctly yes it was cloned correctly so if you take a look at that so here's"
6694940,6701100," the original one here's the copy we modified the copy and everything looks okay isn't that beautiful"
6701100,6707580," isn't that beautiful i think it's quite beautiful so we can pass by reference we can pass by value and"
6707580,6715660," everything works as expected cool um so simulate game so i think um"
6715660,6720300," we're gonna introduce something like simulate game wreck"
6720300,6726780," and it's gonna accept these decks we're not gonna clone it because it's already cloned for us here"
6726780,6735100," so it doesn't matter and then we can take the winner score uh decks as well so essentially it just takes like a different kind of function here"
6735900,6741260," uh yeah and we're gonna implement it somewhere nearby right somewhere nearby"
6746380,6753420," oh we also need to implement equality by the way right we'll also need to implement the quality uh"
6753420,6760220," and probably hashing because at some point i'll need to store the deck"
6760220,6768140," in the set oh it's funny how we need to overwrite all these fundamental methods of uh of object"
6771100,6775020," uh yes okay let's let's actually see if we can we can do that"
6775020,6780380," um so um i think it would be nice to have something like"
6781660,6793100," so what would be better hashing or um hashing or tree um no deriving clonable yeah um okay"
6793100,6801180," so groovy maybe java hash uh set let's read about them hash set"
6803100,6812140," um to to the two so and what is required there right so you have a collection initial capacity"
6814780,6821660," um java and all right name more iconic duo yeah that is true so"
6821660,6829340," okay"
6829340,6838460," so i'm gonna actually comment it out zozin just use this library uh it solves all your problems"
6840700,6846460," okay uh how do you work with sets and guru by the way uh groovy hash sets"
6846460,6849500," groovy set examples"
6849500,6856220," is that really groovy i think it is"
6856220,6863100," uh oh you can just uh you know make it a set okay"
6865740,6872940," uh-huh that's cool all right um so def um"
6872940,6881020," visited i'm gonna call it visited and it's gonna be new hash set um do i have to provide i think i"
6881020,6885740," can do something like that so it's gonna be dex new hash set and if i try to print this entire thing"
6885740,6891420," and i think maybe i might as well actually just return it um"
6891420,6901500," wonder if there is uh an advent of code js library on npm that solves each day"
6901500,6907340," probably um so if i do visit it how do you insert into the hash set"
6908060,6918220," uh do you do insert do you do insert do you do add yeah you do add cool uh add jacks"
6918220,6922860," cool and let's see if that's doing the thing"
6922860,6927180," uh that's doing the thing"
6931180,6937740," okay so yeah it added that thing so if i try to add it twice what's gonna happen"
6937740,6943180," good i'm redeeming myself uh okay"
6943180,6956060," well okay this is because i added exactly the same object right i added exactly the same object so it"
6956060,6959260," doesn't count i might as well actually remove input so it doesn't pollute the output"
6960780,6964540," you're pretending to be wrong yeah okay"
6964540,6970380," okay so i added this object twice it's still nothing but"
6970380,6976140," the ultimate testimony would be to actually add a colon of that object what's gonna happen"
6984380,6993020," and there you go we added two identical objects there and uh that's kind of sad gap that's kind of sad gap"
6993020,7001180," all right so let's google java hashing so how do you do hashing hashing in java um to the tune"
7003660,7012060," npm has a package so you found the package for advent of code right oh holy okay so why why did they make"
7012060,7021580," it into a package like why um all right advent of code wasm holy okay i see"
7024380,7033740," zozin just use this library do they have 2020 available already uh okay why do you even need"
7033740,7040780," to write it yourself zozin use this library just use this library come on i can't open it for somebody"
7041420,7051180," oh why is it so slow okay uh oh it's wait a second it's rust"
7051180,7058300," we now host rust projects on npm is that a thing we're doing now"
7061020,7067180," i'm i'm completely out of the loop uh oh my god we have a raid from gamosa thank you thank you so"
7067180,7074460," much for the rate uh and welcome everyone to our advent of code adventures that's right we're solving"
7074460,7081340," advent of code day 22. i'm like intentionally lagging behind by one day because i give people"
7081340,7089020," opportunity to solve the problem first and uh we are um actually using a different language for each day"
7090700,7099500," uh it's actually like literally torture but it it was interesting so yeah uh we solved 21 problems so"
7099500,7105580," far and we used 21 different language here are all of the languages we use so far"
7105580,7112780," and uh i ran out of good languages okay i ran out of good languages and we're"
7112780,7118460," really scraping the bottom of the barrel uh and we are programming in groovy so yeah"
7120860,7127340," and i still need to come up with three more languages and uh yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be rough"
7127340,7135580," it's gonna be rough so yeah does anyone even know such language as groovy uh does anyone know about"
7135580,7142380," it it's like a jvm like a scripting jvm um well i mean maybe we're gonna use cobalt at some point we'll see"
7142380,7148860," you will see so yeah we already solved part one we're trying to figure out part two and i'm more"
7148860,7154220," of a like a fighting with the language pascal we already did pascal by the way uh just actually"
7154220,7160460," go to this repo seriously but like check it out it's actually pretty cool repo and uh here are the"
7160460,7170940," languages if you look at that we did the pascal the day 15 was done in pascal um so yeah and this is by the"
7170940,7180140," way the classical pascal with integers being 16-bit numbers right i didn't enable any extensions because"
7180140,7187820," i use i use free pascal uh right and it's like no delphi 7 support no anything it's like literally"
7187820,7193740," classic pascal which people used to develop dos applications like in 90s that's what i use here"
7194220,7201900," um yeah it was fun uh maybe at some point we're gonna try fortran uh we'll see you use insects okay"
7201900,7207260," okay did we have in 64 in the dos times i don't think so i think we didn't have in 64."
7207260,7216540," um okay so i cheated a little bit i'm sorry sorry uh anyway so today is day 22 and we're doing groovy"
7216540,7224700," groovy is like you know just uh you know this thing it's a it's a mix between java and python so far"
7224700,7229500," uh and it has a pretty good interrupt with java i gotta say so if you want to use something from java so"
7229500,7237420," you can just you can just do that about that about that um is anyone from the gamoza chat participates in"
7237420,7246380," advent of code uh do you guys like this kind of stuff um all right so i'm trying what i'm trying"
7246380,7252460," to figure out is i'm trying to remember how to put an object into a hash table uh because i forgot how to"
7252460,7260860," do that right so if i have an object and uh i'm pretty sure i need to implement it's hashing or something"
7260860,7268780," like that or maybe i need to implement it equals uh yeah i have suggestion for advent of code using"
7268780,7279100," formality language i don't know um we'll see i'll see i'll think about it um okay so um java equal"
7279100,7286380," right how do you do that difference between equals do you have to do something special for equals methods"
7286380,7294220," is that a thing uh if i want to overwrite um yeah this is something that we can actually check i think"
7294220,7305580," this is something that can be differently checked for example i can do dx equals dx clone right and um"
7305580,7310620," essentially if you try to do something like that it will tell you false right obviously it will tell you"
7310620,7319020," false um and also this language is very fast this is a start type start a startup time of a scripting"
7319020,7324780," language okay as you can see it's false uh right and if i try to do equals uh equals"
7324780,7330540," it should be also false if i understand things correctly"
7334460,7340620," yes it's also false so i think we need to override equals okay so let's quickly do that it's going"
7340620,7345900," to be overwrite and i think it's going to be boolean equal uh is it boolean yeah it's building equals"
7345900,7355020," and object um so we have this uh and we're going to have that uh it's advisable to keep changes to"
7355020,7363820," equals in sync with hash code thank you captain very cool uh okay so what do we have here um"
7364460,7372220," um so we can try to do something like uh first of all uh we need to check if it's instance of that"
7372220,7387900," specific class so if that instance of uh decks right um oh yeah automatic automatic casting like in kotlin"
7387900,7393260," would be so useful here i'm starting to understand why people like kotlin like because you can check for a"
7393260,7400060," specific type and now you don't have to create another variable for that um right so but but"
7400060,7408940," in groovy i probably have to do something like this um and uh it's going to be like that depth that um"
7408940,7417500," and i would assume that this is how you cast the class um right and after that you should be able"
7417500,7427420," to do the following thing uh this one's gonna be false obviously um and um this player uh player one"
7427420,7436540," have to be equal to that player one right so it's quite important this player one is it is equal to"
7436540,7441340," that player one because we have only two like uh fields here player one and player two"
7441340,7451020," um as jack throw exception if it can cast oh okay uh as decks oh that's pretty convenient thank you so"
7451020,7457180," we have professional uh groovy developers in the chat nice that's actually super cool i really appreciate"
7457180,7465420," your professional experience thank you for sharing uh cool so i guess equals is gonna work"
7465420,7469420," equals is gonna work"
7475580,7484060," it is true you see it is true now how about that and uh if i try to do that yet again it has to be false"
7485500,7487500," uh which server are you working for"
7487500,7498860," localhost i don't understand the question excuse me um wait a second"
7498860,7507340," wait a second is groovy calls equals when you do equal equal"
7511420,7512780," i can see groovy doing that"
7512780,7523260," i mean i'm okay with that i suppose so sure um okay so and now uh let's see how all of that is"
7523260,7529820," going to play out uh with uh hash tables i think hash tables are not going to work because the hash"
7529820,7534060," functions are probably going to be completely different so the hash functions should be completely different"
7535420,7543100," uh yeah as you can see even though we over written equals uh we still can put the same thing into into"
7543100,7548780," the into the into the hash set so another thing we need to do we probably need to overwrite the hash code"
7548780,7554700," uh so let me see java hash code i think it's how it's called hash code or something something"
7554700,7562380," guides to hash code okay so uh java equals and hash code let's take a look at that let's take a look at that"
7565420,7574700," is there any examples on how to implement your own hash code equals one"
7574700,7583500," is it equals one i that's a nice hash code thank you very much is it one or l i cannot this is like"
7583500,7592620," a very bad uh font but i would expect this to be one yes nice hash code thank you so much okay um"
7593180,7604220," all right so you basically multiply them together all right that's cool um so hash code is integer"
7604220,7609900," so is that a good thing class so we can produce different results uh let's improve a little bit"
7609900,7615100," the current hash code implementation so uh standard hash code implementation um"
7615100,7620460," yeah let's actually do a very dumb one which basically multiplies the hashes i think that"
7620460,7628540," that should be all right um yeah but we should return random that's a good idea just use random hash for"
7628540,7638860," the same object every time uh okay um now it's going to be int hash code and essentially we're going to do"
7638860,7649900," uh player one player one i said hash code multiply by player two uh hash code cool so now um if i try to put"
7650620,7660220," two copies of the same object into the hash set it should only contain one right should only contain one"
7660220,7669100," according to our calculations there we go so yeah that's cool uh so we have one object we put it into"
7669100,7674780," the hash set we cloned it it's a completely different object with a completely different address but it has an"
7674780,7680940," identical state uh we put it again and it didn't create a copy in the hash table because we all write"
7680940,7688540," equals and we overwrite uh the hash code so everything is as expected so we can now uh quite easy to keep"
7688540,7693820," track of all of the previous states of the game so it's quite important for the solution it's quite important"
7693820,7701980," for the solution uh okay um so we simulate game recursively this one is actually very interesting"
7701980,7712540," careful if one hash codes equals zero every earth everything is equal zero that's actually a good point"
7713580,7726300," um so we can try to do something about that then um so they they're actually trying to uh do that let's"
7726300,7733020," have a look at the standard implementation that uses two primes numbers uh and more uniqueness to compute hash"
7733020,7741340," code all right um can we do something similar"
7741340,7752460," so if you have well uh while it's essential to understand the roles hash code generates the following"
7752460,7758860," um implementation uh yep yep yep yep yep yep yep"
7758860,7764300," but they do plus here right so they do plus"
7764300,7769180," so maybe we can do plus then"
7769180,7773820," no"
7773820,7779340," so in which situation is going to be zero though"
7781900,7783580," in which situation is going to be zero"
7783580,7795740," until we did generate the following so this is basically like different suggestions and stuff"
7795740,7802940," uh they're using 31 because it's a prime number why it's because it's a prime number"
7811340,7817260," okay so i have a couple of ideas maybe so this is id"
7817260,7820620," uh"
7820620,7821100," is that"
7821100,7829740," empty hash percent maybe whatever it doesn't matter um so maybe we're going to have something like results"
7829740,7830620," where i have that"
7830620,7832620," um"
7832620,7837740," it's probably not not going to be the best one right it's probably not going to be the best one but i can"
7837740,7846460," try to do something like 31 uh multiplied by results plus player two hash code right so and this is going"
7846460,7852860," to be the result as well right so it's kind of similar to that uh only we don't have to do this"
7852860,7858940," initial part because it's probably already done for us by the player one hash code so yeah we only need"
7858940,7864860," to stack uh you know more and more hash codes into that so maybe it's a good approach i know nothing"
7864860,7869020," about like theory behind hash functions maybe i need to look into that a little bit closer"
7869660,7876460," um but uh i think this maybe approach is going to be okay for now um and let's go back so it's going"
7876460,7886780," to be visited uh if i add decks right and actually the colon of the decks one more time and just return"
7886780,7897420," visited it should contain only the single object cool nice"
7897420,7906380," uh how are we gonna approach all of that so when i'll be creating visited so we can try to create"
7906380,7912540," visited before the game right we created the visited before the game and we pass and visit it into each"
7912540,7918620," an individual sub game right so simulate a game rack it's not implemented yet but let's get my man"
7918620,7926700," uh that's not my cpu temperature it's very funny uh okay"
7926700,7937900," um is groovy actively used anywhere yes here uh so this is decks and this is visited uh to be fair"
7938620,7947660," if you take a look at the to the index of uh languages right you will see that groovy is actually in uh"
7947660,7957180," 11th place yeah right here and its popular popularity is growing so it's it's kind of similar situation with"
7957180,7964300," java it's like because majority of people who program in that language right uh they're really invisible"
7965580,7971500," on the internet because it's like a i think there is a term for that i think like i heard the term for"
7971500,7979580," that it's a dark matter developer have you guys heard about this term uh popular stop making fun of"
7979580,7989820," my pronunciation or i'm gonna start making fun of yours okay all right uh dark matter developer so uh yeah"
7994300,8002380," dark matter developers uh the unseen majority right so it's like like 99 of developers you don't even"
8002380,8010460," even see them because they're just you know um you know uh nine to five family people who just you know"
8010460,8016780," work on their project for like 30 years they don't like go on stack overflow or anything they're just"
8016780,8023580," doing their own thing for their specific company and when people uh look at these statistics and"
8023580,8029500," realize that the java is one of the most used languages and they don't see that many java"
8029500,8034860," projects on github they get really surprised like what the what the where are all of"
8034860,8040620," this uh all the developers why don't i see uh more and more projects on github like in java like well"
8040620,8046060," this is because they're not on github they're in private in private repos in these enterprise companies"
8046060,8061020," and stuff like that so yeah uh what the where is java all right so uh let me see let me see uh let's"
8061020,8061740," continue"
8061740,8075420," uh okay so what do we get what do we get"
8078540,8080060," yeah let's actually implement all of that"
8080060,8087180," so it's going to be really similar to the original game right it's going to be really similar to the"
8087180,8095980," original game uh only we'll have to recurse everything we will have to recurse everything and i wonder um"
8098380,8102780," when do i put the state of the game into this stuff"
8102780,8111900," now you don't have to it's it's actually pretty pretty innocent it's just i'm a little bit afraid"
8111900,8119660," that it can escalate really quickly uh so uh that's why i put a follow mode um"
8123340,8128140," it's just one once you get like crazy people into the chat you don't know what to expect for them"
8128140,8132860," so yeah uh okay let's actually continue"
8132860,8144860," so there's two conditions i'm crazy by the way"
8148300,8160860," uh before either uh deals so one of the things here is um dex player one right so this is the first uh"
8160860,8168140," condition wait a second i think i forgot to do this thing it it kind of worked it kind of worked out"
8168140,8173100," but yeah uh not equal zero and"
8178300,8185180," so this thing should also return who won all right simulate game should return who won"
8185180,8192700," and this is quite interesting because we need a function that determines who won"
8192700,8201020," right um and it also will accept visited because it's gonna use uh visited to check the current state"
8201020,8205740," and stuff right um all right"
8205740,8214220," who won like right who won uh and we can accept"
8214220,8227340," i need to take a look at the uh one time before either player deals a card if there was a previous"
8227340,8231740," round in the game that had exactly the same card okay so that makes sense that means we can"
8231740,8234700," uh do decks and visit it um"
8234700,8239340," winner uh maybe uh like"
8239340,8242700," winner condition or something like that"
8242700,8247100," uh as i think it has to be called the wreck winner condition"
8248860,8258140," uh a wreck winner condition because we're doing a recursive game right so um um what we do here is we check"
8258140,8269580," uh if visited contains the current decks right uh if they contain that uh let's take a look at java hash set"
8272060,8274060," uh java hash set"
8274060,8279340," so does it have a method contains"
8279340,8284940," uh returns true if the uh set contains the specified elements nice"
8284940,8289180," so if this thing contains uh uh this"
8289180,8296300," we return one okay the player one won right because that's the condition if you already saw that state"
8296300,8304940," before um um player one wins um otherwise if uh decks"
8304940,8311340," player uh one size equal zero right"
8311340,8313580," and um"
8313580,8319180," player two size is greater than zero"
8319980,8322860," that means we're going to return one again um"
8322860,8333660," else if how don't you confuse the syntax of languages why do you think i do not um"
8333660,8339260," okay so this one is going to be uh greater than zero"
8340220,8346860," and this one is going to be uh equals in zero in that case we're going to return two right um"
8346860,8352940," and i guess that's it uh otherwise i think we can check for that condition"
8352940,8359020," first i think it's going to be easier to check for that condition first this one equals zero and"
8359020,8364620," this one equals zero so and this has to be unreachable in my opinion so it's going to be assert"
8365260,8379340," false uh unreachable unreachable both players somehow uh ended up with no cards so this is like a really"
8379340,8386220," unreachable state and we might as well uh put that first so it's a little bit easier to check the other"
8386220,8394380," conditions uh right so essentially like this um right greater than the one um"
8394380,8402060," so if it's one equals zero only one equals zero it's going to be one if it's only two equals zero"
8402060,8415260," uh that's gonna be one um okay and uh then we're gonna do what uh after that we checked everything and"
8415260,8421260," this one is going to be zero and that means that uh nobody won so far yet uh nobody won"
8421260,8438220," so and yep yep yep yep yep and here is the simulation we're running the simulation uh wreck winner condition"
8438220,8449500," dex visited uh equals zero right and i suppose uh here we'll have to implement uh the uh this thing itself"
8449500,8457900," and we may want to return this condition yet again luckily this is actually super critical to compute i can"
8457900,8463580," do it like the second time it would be better to assign it to a variable once and don't worry about it ever"
8464140,8470540," uh but i'm not really sure how to do that so we can have something like i don't know i think this is"
8470540,8473660," the easiest way to do that but i would like to not repeat it that often"
8473660,8480540," i would like to not repeat it that often so if we have something like def um"
8480540,8489740," winner all right winner zero uh can we do something like winner equal"
8490460,8494780," and like this is that a thing we can do and then we can just return the winner oh"
8494780,8500940," uh then we can just return the winner you see see what i'm talking about see what i'm talking about"
8500940,8507820," pretty cool uh while this thing while we didn't determine any winners we have to play this stuff"
8508380,8519100," right um cool so what we're essentially doing is uh this thing so we're popping out these things"
8519100,8527900," uh okay previous rounds uh otherwise the rounds card must be in the new configuration the player begin"
8527900,8532780," in the round okay if both players have at least as many cards remaining in their decks as the way"
8532780,8538380," of the card they've drew the winner round is determined by the plane the new game requires of combat so yeah"
8538380,8551900," essentially if a one um again this messes with my brain a little bit uh remaining in their decks at least"
8553100,8563180," okay so that means i take decks player uh one size it has to be um right"
8563180,8574060," at least as many so it could be equal or greater so equal a one n and"
8577340,8583660," two i really hope i got that right let me read it because uh at least always messes up in the"
8583660,8588780," membrane but both players have at least as many cards remaining in their deck as the value of the"
8588780,8595580," card that edges drew at least so it could be equal and greater so that's that's exactly the condition cool"
8595580,8604060," um so uh and this is where we have to uh start playing this thing yet again"
8604700,8608540," uh we put the decks here but we have to clone them because we have to restore"
8608540,8615980," the uh the original state afterwards right and we put visited here and visit we don't have to clone"
8615980,8620620," because it's global for all of the games right it's global for all the games because at some point we"
8620620,8627500," need to check the condition so somewhere at this point we'll have to check for uh like we'll have to"
8627500,8633260," push the state to uh the visited states but i'm not sure um how we're gonna do that"
8634380,8644460," um i don't think we should do that here because if i push this state uh into the visited states"
8644460,8652780," right here right that means the simulation game is going to be over at this condition"
8652780,8657020," right away so i don't think this is where we have to do that so it's not really appropriate place for"
8657020,8666620," that uh okay so then here is the winner right so we're gonna do it something like sub winner"
8666620,8674860," uh here's a sub winner and depending on who won right so we're gonna have something like that"
8674860,8680140," do we have like a switch case in groovy well we do because groovy is a super set of uh java"
8680140,8684220," by the way chat is everything okay the chat is a little bit dead so i worry it may be something with"
8684220,8689500," my stream the stream is okay it's just everyone is like listening to what i'm trying to trying to do"
8689500,8702220," here uh okay so if sub winner um yeah switch sub winner uh i think i can do something huh okay so it does work"
8702220,8709820," if it's one uh do i have to blue break um okay if it's one the um"
8714220,8720860," just sick fault it uh okay and in which order we'll have to put them though um"
8720860,8728540," if both player have at least as many cards remain in their deck as the values of the card they just"
8728540,8737660," drew the winner of the round is determined by the uh playing a new game of recursive combat c below okay so"
8743420,8753740," so that means where is the where is the first sub game playing sub game to determine the winner so game"
8753740,8765020," one and game three uh-huh okay so uh what's interesting is that the player one would win"
8765020,8770780," in this situation in the previous in the previous rules right but if we scroll down below"
8772620,8787180," uh player two one no player two one um and back to the game one so and we put three four ha"
8787180,8796700," for the player two we put three four but yeah so it's kind of similar so if player one has one"
8796700,8801420," we'll have to we'll have to we'll have to do this thing right we'll have to do this thing right we'll"
8801420,8811100," have to do this thing uh right if it's a player two we'll have to do this thing i suppose the the ordering"
8811100,8819020," is still the same uh i think i think it's going to be like still the same so and in case of anything else"
8819020,8831180," in case of anything else this is assertion um it's false uh and we're gonna say um uh sub game uh results"
8831180,8840700," uh unexpected unexpected sub game results and we can just return this sub winner uh and see how it goes"
8841820,8849900," right so yeah otherwise we're starting the same situation here right uh we can probably even copy"
8849900,8858780," paste uh think like this right so if it's that uh we're adding this state here"
8860620,8865660," uh if it's that we're adding that state here and then at some point a reasonable state of the game"
8865660,8879900," um um uh players had equal uh players drew uh equal cards there we go so this is another situation"
8879900,8885340," that should probably never happen but it uh if it happens we're going to be ready for that all right"
8885340,8892140," so the only thing we don't do here we don't save the state of the game ever anywhere which is kind of"
8892140,8892540," interesting"
8892540,8905340," all right so look uh we definitely don't push the state here right as already said if we do visit it"
8905340,8912940," add dex clone it's gonna up the next recursive call we can try to do that afterwards right we can try to"
8912940,8925100," do that afterwards um so we play this game um all right and then we add it here so and what's funny"
8925100,8933180," is that we can try to do that before we're modifying any of these things we're adding that state before"
8933180,8940700," modifying everything like this before modifying everything yeah and in this particular particular"
8940700,8945980," case we're also adding them before modifying anything so that's quite quite important um"
8945980,8952780," yeah uh we may try to get rid of the duplicate code but apart from that i think that's it"
8952780,8962780," i do think so um did i forget anything did i forget anything i think that's it"
8963900,8973580," um okay uh so here's the part two so this is the recursive uh recursive thing and then we calculate"
8973580,8979180," the winner score the same way as we uh calculated before right so the game the winner player score"
8979180,8983100," is calculated from the cards uh they have had in their original deck using the same rules as regular"
8983100,8990540," combat in the above example the winner player score is 295 okay cool uh so if i go here now so i only have a"
8990540,8999100," a sample and let's see how badly we screwed up i don't know maybe maybe we screwed up quite badly maybe we didn't"
8999100,9012060," and yeah we fucked up we really really really fucked up uh okay so um"
9018940,9029100," we can start by tracing the games right we can start by tracing the games and maybe even counting the"
9029100,9039900," games as well um so it's gonna be like um uh game count right this is gonna be a game count"
9039900,9047340," maybe just count let's code count i think it's gonna be okay uh to the part one so this is gonna"
9047340,9053100," be game one right as i already mentioned and every time you do that recursively you do count plus one"
9053100,9062140," right um then um do we keep track of the rounds as well we can we can try to do that so we we have like a"
9062140,9069260," round and so on and so forth so um because of that maybe it makes sense to call it a game"
9069900,9076620," uh uh and then we can have a round which is initially one and at the end of that round"
9076620,9083180," you always increment that round right something like this so that will help us to trace all of that a"
9083180,9088940," little bit easier and then we can do something like this this is going to be print alone uh okay around"
9088940,9099020," uh around game uh game right and then we can print the land the current state of the decks and let's see"
9099020,9104940," what's gonna happen in case of the part two and we can just compare the traces uh we can simply compare"
9104940,9113820," the traces and see where exactly we fucked up all right so here is the traces uh and the result turned"
9113820,9120380," out to be three four eight we also have part yeah so here's the part one part one part one doesn't trace"
9120380,9129500," anything so should be okay uh should be okay and then we can just compare those things we need to do that"
9129500,9147660," okay so uh nine two one uh uh two six eight four uh so far so good so the round three uh"
9147660,9155660," fk4 os thank you thank you so much for twitch prime subscription thank you thank you thank you and welcome"
9155660,9163740," tour epic advent of cool club that's right welcome welcome welcome so uh okay i can do something like"
9163740,9171980," this uh yeah it does matches then i can take something like this so i'm pretty sure um"
9174220,9179340," at some point at some point i made the oopsie doopsie and fucky wacky round five"
9179340,9192860," uh-huh is that round six is that i can i think i can i'm gonna go until that and round nine game one"
9193580,9201260," is four nine eight 52 uh three ten one okay so um"
9201260,9209580," might as well actually copy paste the entire trace the entire trace"
9209580,9221180," somewhere here uh it's gonna be temporary too so we have like 31 round in here um"
9223580,9229020," attempt three might as well copy paste this entire trace so i can use the same editor though"
9229020,9231580," um i think that's uh"
9231580,9240780," finally i see a good use of grew not the usual jenkins bullshit uh is it using jenkins usually interesting"
9240780,9243260," uh okay"
9245340,9255020," so we have uh round 31 and where do we end actually yeah we have more rounds than i expected"
9255020,9260300," so i definitely fucked up somewhere uh and i wonder where exactly maybe i didn't clone"
9260300,9266060," things enough that could be the case maybe i didn't clone things enough"
9269260,9276700," so when i pass uh okay simulate game wrecked uh i can i kind of want to clone it just just in case"
9276700,9278300," all right so my game wrecked"
9278300,9288220," so when i pass in there i i clone it and then um i call it twice here"
9289660,9295420," quote and then we modify everything so um yeah"
9295420,9308700," so basically what i need to do i just need to um go through the trace and find where it starts to"
9308700,9313100," deviate uh but it's kind of mad it's kind of man"
9315500,9322940," uh we can also but every time we determine a winner um we can just print it as well"
9322940,9328940," um so let's quickly do that print ln um"
9328940,9341660," winner and it's going to be some winner some winner it's double n of course winner is that and here we can"
9341660,9350620," print ln um winner one and this is winner two i'm just afraid that maybe i'm simply"
9350620,9361660," pushing the elements not in the correct order so that could be the case and something went completely"
9361660,9368620," wrong missing property length where's the length where do they use length uh"
9368620,9376860," wait how did it how did that happen"
9379340,9385340," uh did they accidentally modify that it's supposed to be size the"
9385340,9389500," the"
9389500,9394300," now it's 93"
9405740,9409420," okay let's let's try to read the rules one more time let's read the rules one more time"
9409420,9411980," um"
9411980,9419900," oh we have eight raiders from dandymagg thank you thank you for the rate and welcome"
9419900,9422540," so we're doing groovy development"
9422540,9429340," if there was a previous round in this game that had exactly the same cards in the same order"
9430060,9437660," and uh in a win for player one so and i think we did uh we took that into account for sure right so um"
9437660,9445420," winning condition so if we already visited those decks right so player one instantly wins if both of"
9445420,9451580," the decks are zero that means it's unreachable state player one is zero that means uh one had win"
9453580,9463180," wait a second wins the one who has the full the winner is the one who has all the cards oh my god i'm an idiot"
9463180,9467020," okay"
9470620,9476460," oh okay uh i'm glad i checked it out i'm glad i checked it out"
9476460,9484940," uh come on you can do that i'm a big bagger i'm a huge bagger it's still 93"
9484940,9492220," and also part is zero part one shouldn't be zero okay i messed up something so i think i i messed up the"
9492220,9498700," winner uh uh the winner uh the winner score or something where is the score um okay"
9498700,9511980," so if it's size greater than zero ziyang is back to the champion of the arena welcome back"
9515660,9524060," okay so 306 is correct 78 is not correct uh 78 is not correct and i have no idea why it is like that"
9524060,9532700," excuse me all right um okay so the first one wins if both of them are zero that means something's fishy"
9533180,9546060," um so if decks play greater than zero and this one okay"
9546060,9555020," okay i'm getting a little bit tired i'm getting a little bit tired but at least i'm at least i'm"
9555020,9560620," realizing my mistakes at least i'm realizing my mistakes so maybe i will eventually solve it please"
9560620,9572060," please please i hope still 78 why is it 78 i might assume it's incorrect because your solution has"
9572060,9584940," mistake or several mistakes ah okay that explains it uh that explained it so visited one if both of them"
9584940,9592620," are zero incorrect if the this thing is greater than zero but the second one is zero we won first one if"
9592620,9600300," this thing is greater zero zero and this thing is zero this one otherwise we have not won so far so and"
9600300,9606300," while the winner right is equal to zero we keep repeating this thing and then we return the winner"
9608060,9612140," uh all right so uh we check this thing if both of these"
9612140,9616860," very recall we simulate the game"
9616860,9623180," shouldn't winner condition be equal to the deck size"
9629180,9636700," no uh so it should become like empty"
9636700,9644140," um i need to read the uh read the rules one more time i need to read the rules one more time because"
9644140,9649660," i'm pretty sure i'm misunderstanding them uh if there was a previous round where we have something like"
9649660,9654220," that instantly ends previous rounds for the games are not uh considered"
9654220,9661980," previous rounds from other games"
9661980,9670140," i think i missed this uh statement i think i missed this statement okay before either player deals um"
9672620,9678220," if there was a previous round in this game in this specific game"
9678220,9686620," okay i am pepega so"
9686620,9693100," if the previous in this specific game the rounds from other games are not considered so that means am i visited"
9694940,9695900," holy shit okay"
9695900,9703500," the puzzle is not the imp like the problem itself the puzzle is trying to understand what the"
9703500,9710540," fuck they want for you okay so uh we don't need to do visited here right so this is completely redundant"
9710540,9719340," right and uh visited is essentially this thing right this is a new hash set uh hash set of decks"
9720220,9728860," um and um sim uh we don't have to accept the visited here uh simulate"
9728860,9736060," uh game wreck we don't have to push this visited here um right"
9736060,9744220," in this specific game all right so um they're not considered"
9744220,9748700," the rounds card must be in new configuration the player okay"
9750220,9759020," um cool so can i is there any way for me to easily disable the tracing"
9763980,9777580," can you stop touching my head for some reason well i know the reason actually the reason is pretty simple"
9777580,9783020," uh-huh"
9787420,9788460," okay part two"
9788460,9795660," uh well i know what's going on"
9795660,9802540," we need to remove clone"
9802540,9813820," yes because this line relies on this function modifying the decks and i put clone there"
9814540,9823020," yes i fucked myself over because of that cool so it shouldn't be modified for the other things but"
9823020,9823900," yeah"
9823900,9835100," there we go 291 291 uh is it 291 there we go it's a 291 who would have thought who would have thought"
9835100,9839900," so let's take a look at all the tracing debug tracing so i might as well actually put something like"
9839900,9846460," debug here right so it's easier to find in the future and re-disable if i fuck myself over one more time"
9846460,9856380," uh right something like debug and now i should be able to do find debug right and just like that"
9856380,9863660," like that cool um and then i can re-enable it again i don't have like a pre-processor or something"
9864620,9873580," but yeah so here's the sample and sample returns correct results so far as far as you can tell it"
9873580,9881420," still traces this okay so where is the another printer oh yeah there we go so we can do something like"
9881420,9890220," this debug debug"
9890220,9896860," okay so these are correct results"
9896860,9905580," chat i need your help i need your help somebody issue the command thank you thank you so much i really"
9905580,9915100," appreciate it thank you thank you thank you and is it going to be the pog moment we've been waiting for"
9917980,9924140," uh"
9924140,9927820," is groovy that slow"
9927820,9936540," i don't know why but i expected something like that yeah"
9943420,9948540," oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no not this slow"
9948540,9955820," yeah java java java"
9955820,9958780," interesting"
9958780,9968060," uh all right so okay i've chosen the right language what can i say"
9968860,9982220," um nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice uh we can enable tracing right we can enable tracing though"
9982220,9989180," uh it's probably gonna make it slower but we can um you know just do that"
9991260,10002460," debug uh like this like this like this and um where is my terminal this is my terminal i need to"
10002460,10009420," rearrange some things uh all right so and i'm gonna redirect all of that to the output txt"
10009420,10014300," and uh we'll see how it goes we'll see how it goes"
10016700,10025740," uh groovy and tail mindset output txt and uh around so the game one"
10025740,10033820," so game 12 so so far we have a game 12 or something"
10041740,10043180," it's gone relatively fast"
10043180,10049820," round 85 game nine"
10049820,10055900," encoder a corner goes i'm sorry for the encoder though"
10055900,10065020," game 10 we're still on game 10 though we're still on game 10"
10070860,10073180," should i wait should i wait should i wait though"
10073180,10080220," did it stuck on the game wait a second"
10080220,10098380," game 11 round is that normal"
10101180,10102060," is that normal"
10102060,10106780," i don't i don't think it's normal though"
10106780,10110220," um"
10110220,10113660," that seems a bit sus yes i do agree"
10113660,10115900," um"
10115900,10118780," yeah"
10118780,10121020," shit on the rounds"
10121020,10128220," uh okay so uh let me read the rules one more time maybe i just missed them"
10129020,10129820," miss something"
10129820,10134620," before the player deals a card if there was a previous round"
10134620,10141500," in this game that had exactly the same cards in the same order in the same player's decks the game"
10141500,10147580," instantly ends in a win for player one uh previous runs for other games are not considered the uh"
10147580,10153660," this prevents infinite games of recursive combat uh which everyone would do is a bad idea okay"
10154940,10162620," uh all right uh otherwise uh this uh rounds card must be in a new configuration the players begin the"
10162620,10169020," round by each drawing the top cards of their deck as normal all right uh if both players have at least"
10169020,10174860," as many cards remaining in their decks as the value of the cards they just drew"
10174860,10179740," the winner of the round is determined by playing a new game of recursive combat"
10179740,10181100," although my game"
10181100,10187820," otherwise at least one player must not have enough cards left in their deck to recurse the winner of the"
10187820,10192620," round is uh the round is uh the player with the higher value card okay"
10192620,10199260," as in regular compared to the winner of the round if they won the round between a sub game"
10199260,10204540," takes the two cards dealt at the beginning of the round and places them on the bottom of their"
10204540,10210380," own deck again so that the winner's card is above the uh other cards i think i took the note that"
10210380,10215180," the winner's card might be the lower value of the two cards okay if they won the round due to the"
10215180,10220460," winning the sub game if collecting uh cards by winning the round causes the player to have all the cards"
10220460,10222380," they win and the game ends"
10222380,10225740," um"
10225740,10232140," all right that's very interesting and i think i take all that into account"
10232140,10239900," right so with these uh we only considered visited decks for that specific game and for nothing else for"
10239900,10245180," that specific game all right so that's why we created new visited every time we start a new game"
10245180,10252940," um okay so and then we take a look at the erect winner condition right if we see the decks that we"
10252940,10262220," already saw before it's the player one okay so um if we have a situation like this is an impossible"
10262220,10269420," situation but i still check for it just in case uh so player one size"
10269420,10276780," is greater than zero but player two size is zero that means player one won so they run out of cards"
10276780,10282460," if the player two size is bigger than zero and player one size is equal zero uh it's player two"
10282460,10290380," otherwise nobody won so far the game continues right okay and we save the winner here um and while it's"
10290380,10296860," equal we continue the loop and once we determine the winner we return that winner and we know who won"
10297580,10309420," and we know who won all right so uh cool uh pop i as far as i know pop is the same as here so we do the"
10309420,10316940," pop and we take a look at the cards uh if the whale is okay so this is the most important conditions a"
10316940,10324380," condition uh if both players have at least as many cards remaining dead as the values of the card they"
10324380,10331340," just drew at least equal or greater right so the size is equal or greater of the cards that they just drew"
10331340,10340140," and here it is here is the condition cool so that means we have to start playing a sub game right so we uh"
10340860,10345660," clone the decks um all right to be fair"
10345660,10351260," uh we can um"
10351260,10360060," we can actually put this thing here because uh we're not sharing visited right we're not sharing visited"
10360060,10364700," so that means we can just put it here after we already check the condition and uh we can remove"
10364700,10373180," these things at least i don't think it's it if it improves anything uh right"
10380300,10385660," do you're missing the condition the decks shouldn't be cloned i don't understand what you mean yet"
10391020,10403740," okay okay"
10421020,10432940," i'll see below uh a new game of recursive combat"
10432940,10437420," um sub game"
10437420,10444940," okay see below uh a new game of recursive combat"
10446300,10454060," in a regular combat the winner here's example a small game during the around okay primary game"
10454060,10463900," after the game the winner score is calculated"
10463900,10473660," i don't think i missed anything uh okay so we clone the deck it's already visited"
10474620,10475900," we pop their players"
10475900,10480300," uh-huh and we put it there"
10480300,10489500," and then we add them back"
10489500,10491820," add them back"
10491820,10498700," why are you saying they shouldn't be cloned okay let me take a look at the trace"
10500460,10505740," so let me take a look at the trace so we're starting here and then we continue from here"
10505740,10510460," then we continue from here up until the game returns"
10510460,10514860," uh back to game one"
10514860,10521420," well i mean we start we like recover the previous state that means we need to clone them"
10522140,10528860," like i'm literally looking at the trace and we need to we need to clone them like according"
10528860,10537500," first on the first uh round of the game of the uh of the sub game yes"
10540300,10547740," okay so we remove these things and then"
10547740,10559660," what the where is six"
10561900,10563100," where did six go"
10563100,10569740," we had six here where did it go"
10569740,10575100," what the like they didn't even say anything about that"
10581500,10586860," if we have at least many cards remaining in the deck as well as the card they just drew the winner of the"
10586860,10589500," to play"
10589500,10594140," um to play a game"
10597340,10597820," to play"
10597820,10608140," a sub game each player creates new deck by making a copy of the next cards in their decks"
10608140,10614220," holy i completely missed oh my god why is it so bad"
10614220,10624220," what what is this what is this problem challenging even what is it challenging your ability to read"
10625100,10626780," i'm like really bad at reading"
10626780,10633100," to play a sub game of recursive which player creates a new deck by making a copy of their"
10633100,10641260," next cards what is that what is does this mean the quantity of cards copied is equal to the number"
10641260,10643740," of the cards they drew to triggers okay"
10643740,10651180," holy it's so bad okay um can we have a constructor"
10653180,10658380," uh well i guess i didn't solve this problem either"
10658380,10669340," this entire advent of code is a huge disappointment"
10669340,10673980," can i not provide these things let's see if i cannot provide these things"
10676540,10682220," all right so uh this player one one player one"
10682220,10690220," holy"
10690220,10697820," so and is it possible to do a take"
10702300,10711180," so groovy"
10711180,10719900," if i need to construct a past name parameter to default uh constructors well too bad i already"
10719900,10725980," implemented it i don't know where you've been take uh i would appreciate if you told me that before i"
10725980,10726620," did that so"
10726620,10735820," um returns the first num elements of the head of the list so i suppose it creates a new list every time"
10735820,10738940," right returns a num list returns a list"
10738940,10743980," does it return a new list about this i would assume yes"
10743980,10748060," i would assume it but but you never know you actually need to check that i think"
10749100,10757500," um you actually need to check that so um you can do something like x one two three four so this is the"
10757500,10764140," list right um but what i'm what list am i using i'm just using yeah i'm using this list"
10764780,10776780," so and then i can do something like wise uh access take two of them and then i can add 69 and 420"
10776780,10780300," right and see and let's see if it's gonna do the thing"
10780300,10783740," uh wise"
10783740,10789740," um all right so is it gonna do the trick is it gonna do the trick"
10794780,10804220," i couldn't find a constructor for decks where did it where did it fail it failed at 44"
10813020,10817340," okay so um can i do it like that"
10817340,10829660," i just want to check if it creates a new list so i don't need to check like anything else it's such"
10829660,10833340," a simple thing i couldn't find uh okay 17"
10833340,10842540," um well to be fair this one is easier to implement then it's just one this one is easier to implement"
10843020,10848300," um so and then we can just do it like that"
10848300,10863500," why is this compilation so slow java roughly if i have one piece of advice to you it would be never"
10863500,10871820," uh dedicate your life to java development like if somebody suggests you like some sort of work"
10872380,10879180," in a particular language right look into that language and double check if it's based on jvm"
10879180,10889980," never never accept any job in jvm based languages ever don't do that it's gonna up your life"
10889980,10899260," and you won't be able to recover from that so yeah anyways um so it does create like a separate list"
10900620,10905260," so look at me look at me look at me now so that's that's the result you lose your hair"
10905260,10911980," you have no job that's the result of jvm so it is what it is um"
10911980,10916380," uh okay"
10919500,10936140," um we need to create a new one so new decks uh is going to be decks player um why like holy"
10936140,10943820," fuck why didn't you put that into a single place is that a challenge the challenge of is actually piecing"
10943820,10950060," together all of these rules but not actually implementing that how is that even advent of code"
10950060,10960300," then advent of code or maybe word code here used in a sense of like cipher you know code like you see"
10960300,10966540," what i mean yeah like it's maybe that's what they mean by word code i i don't know like uh uh"
10968620,10977100," enigma code yeah exactly i'm so pissed off like seriously um but this is because i'm bad i'm mad"
10977100,10984940," because of bad right so um anyway to play a sub game or recursive copy of the next card uh the quantity"
10984940,10987980," of course copied is equal to the number of the cards they drew"
10987980,10998700," during this okay the quantity of the cards copied is equal to the number on the card they drew"
10998700,11009980," okay cool uh but other uh yes but people say yes people say yes uh but i never tried the other years though"
11013580,11018300," um"
11018300,11024140," so that's the thing we have to do instead of calling as far as i can tell oh yeah i can just do it like"
11024140,11024380," that"
11024380,11037340," uh cool so then we can have game plus one nice nice nice nice so how many times i do dex uh dex cool so"
11037340,11043020," well i need i still need dex clone because i need to you know put it into the visited so i still need a lot"
11043020,11051980," uh cool cool cool cool cool cool it's been steadily getting worse"
11051980,11061660," well i mean essentially like the problem with all these competitions is that it's really hard to"
11061660,11067740," control the difficulty difficulty of the competitions right and as the competitions become more and more"
11067740,11077420," popular the probability of very strong um strong players coming in becomes higher so uh the organizers"
11077420,11085340," have to come up with artificial ways of making the problems harder to sort of like uh meet up the"
11085340,11092380," expectations of the best players right so and those artificial ways include making these kind of descriptions"
11092380,11098860," that have nothing to do with the actual problem so it's just like artificial clutter to get through so"
11098860,11104380," it's a little bit more difficult for the top players to uh to solve it in five seconds or something like"
11104380,11115740," that right so um so um so this like situation uh put to extreme can be observed on code forces for example"
11115740,11123340," right if you take a look at like some of the problems on code forces these days they they are even more cryptic than that sometimes"
11123340,11131420," um i think at some point they're gonna actually make it difficult to read not with more words but by"
11131420,11138860," actually changing the case of the letters or maybe using zalgafication right so maybe at some point"
11138860,11144620," they're gonna literally use like zalga like that so it's more difficult to read because they ran out"
11144620,11150060," of ways of making the problem more difficult so and i can actually see them doing that right"
11151980,11154860," i wouldn't be surprised like seriously uh"
11154860,11162380," um yeah challenge is written it's capture yes"
11162380,11172540," because in computer science there is not that many ways of making problem more difficult except adding piles"
11172540,11178620," on top of piles of phases that you have to go through or like making description more difficult to read"
11179420,11181420," so that's kind of the problem you have to deal with"
11181420,11188940," um all right so and i'm speaking from this perspective of the organizers so"
11188940,11195980," all right so looks good good uh and uh let me see so we're not included input i'm not going to"
11195980,11202940," include input for now i'm going to only take a look at this sample uh guess the key to read the problem yeah"
11208940,11215580," okay so so far i didn't break any of the solutions uh and maybe i want to get rid of the debug because"
11215580,11219020," it's not going to help me to become an epic cooter"
11219020,11226860," monk omega"
11226860,11236140," ah very funny very funny joke uh lazy greed what's up what's up what's up what's up do you like groovy"
11236140,11240540," do you like groovy how's it going how's it going how's it going lazy great very good soon"
11240540,11244220," um okay god"
11244220,11252220," yeah they already can't manage problems complexity well they include multiple tests input yeah"
11252220,11257100," i think it's yeah i think it's just like the result of the same problem like there's"
11257100,11263420," something like fundamentally uh limiting in the programming competitions um"
11263420,11271420," um it's going fine nice i'm really glad to hear that uh all right so let's go to make file"
11281420,11286780," it's just like at some point this kind of problems become really really perverted and there's nothing"
11286780,11289500," much we can do about that uh"
11289500,11299180," okay so uh the answer was 35 97 and i suppose this is going to be the final result"
11299980,11312380," um all right let me double check 31 5 uh 31 1 2 0 and yeah one golden start okay cool uh thank you so"
11312380,11314220," much young i suppose"
11314220,11320540," well yeah i didn't solve that problem either okay i didn't solve that problem either"
11321260,11327340," uh because if not jiang pointing out that i missed the paragraph i wouldn't solve it so i guess i'm not"
11327340,11335820," a god quarter after all so yeah well i mean it's it's okay so i already kind of accepted that i'm not"
11335820,11338860," really good at programming so uh"
11338860,11350940," but yeah what's up on the both welcome back look at that we solved both of the uh both of the parts"
11350940,11359820," we solved both of the parts uh and yeah the groovy is done the groovy is done"
11361740,11370540," how you ordered sushi bon appetit my friend bon appetit okay so let's go and do a committee committee"
11370540,11376620," how about that are you ready for a little bit of a committee committee and maybe even a pushy pushy"
11376620,11379340," so this is how we're going to go about that i'm going to create a readme"
11379340,11387020," uh and uh let's document our solution so i usually document this this solution and it's going to be day"
11387660,11399980," uh 22. day 22. um and uh we're going to put a thing here solution in groovy solution and groovy and"
11399980,11410460," uh there we go i'm not writing java talks i'm sorry i'm not a real java cat damn it mate"
11410460,11417820," it debated me again this bot debated me like the third time already holy fuck um okay"
11417820,11428940," god damn zoomer bot debating my boomer language um okay so test it on and we're gonna provide the"
11428940,11437500," environment for which we tested all of that so um so jvm uh version of the jvm group bot best bot do you"
11437500,11445980," use it uh i never heard about it um it was their plan all along yeah it looks like it uh i don't know"
11445980,11453260," why i'm doing that i cannot uh use i cannot access tmux uh clipboards anyway so um delete trailing"
11453260,11463420," white spaces and okay so another thing oh ah okay that was weird so and uh the next thing i need to check"
11463420,11469660," the version of the groovy so the version of the groovy so what's the version of the groovy uh ah"
11469660,11478140," i cannot have it here so because i'm in a wrong environment wait a second my previous solution was"
11478140,11485580," running all alone while i was writing it well wait a second i didn't realize that it was running and"
11487020,11497580," the size of the i already removed it okay and then i was surprised why my computer is so slow um okay"
11497580,11503180," okay at least i don't have any jvms running right now uh"
11503180,11510860," professional software well i'm not a professional software developer uh okay so we have here's the"
11510860,11517740," groovy version oh it also prints the version of the jvm as well so we don't need the version of the jvm"
11517740,11526940," that's nice uh okay so but i'm gonna provide both of them so expected uh expected results uh result is"
11526940,11534060," going to be what uh we're going to take a look at the compilation of our nation is going to be this thing"
11535580,11544780," uh huh so this is expected result cool uh quick start so how to set that up install uh groovy"
11544780,11551500," install groovy how do you install groovy you have to literally download it from the official website"
11551500,11562220," uh oh that's very interesting huh i cannot okay so let's actually give it like this"
11563020,11571100," uh okay install groovy and um to be fair you also have to set up jvm properly i'm gonna copy paste some"
11571100,11577820," of the instructions from the scala uh and it's kind of similar install jdk and make sure that java is"
11577820,11587100," available and uh java home is set up and everything like that um so then install groovy and make sure"
11587820,11602940," um groovy is available at path um okay just install groovy then point uh groovy home"
11605260,11618380," um environment um environment variable to the groovy distribution and uh also make sure groovy executable"
11618380,11630700," is available in uh path then uh just make so i hope i this is sufficient enough hopefully that this this is"
11630700,11639100," sufficient enough and i think we're ready to um do a committee okay so"
11639100,11651820," 22 and uh what we're gonna have here what we're gonna have here um so add day 22 solution"
11652700,11658780," in groovy that's what we're gonna do here i'm gonna push that right into the repo you can find all of"
11658780,11669260," the solutions here you can find them all here and uh yeah let's take a look at them we solved 22 days in 22"
11670220,11685260," different languages oh my god i'm going crazy i'm literally going crazy uh and github cannot keep up"
11685260,11691020," with the amount of languages we tried so it says that we have others 57 it doesn't even show all of the"
11691020,11696220," languages like more than half of the languages like can it fit here so that's how many of them we have here"
11697660,11707820," by the way don't choose something too weird for tomorrow okay that's really promising uh week"
11707820,11713100," all right so"
11713100,11724220," tomorrow would be great for bash okay sure i don't really have that many not weird uh not weird option"
11724220,11734460," that's the problem there's not that many not weird options so oak oak maybe maybe we'll see we'll see"
11734460,11741900," about that uh you wasted yeah i wasted all the good languages before today so look at the first"
11741900,11749900," languages like rust haskell java dc plus plus python go js so camel c and nim was okayish um"
11751660,11761420," so yeah i guess i could continue uh doing voodoo's today but to be fair for the for the last two streams"
11761420,11769420," i've been streaming like four or five hours and i think today i'm gonna make a shorter stream because"
11769420,11775180," i'm a little bit tired on that all like on that advent of course thinking no pascal we had pascal come on"
11775820,11783340," so here's the pascal day 15. uh day 15 why not r because i hate it small talk no i hate it i'm not"
11783340,11792780," going to use that language i hate it i hate all of them so um okay uh yeah so i'm not going to continue"
11792780,11797980," streaming anymore because the previous streams were kind of difficult why not swift i hate it because i hate"
11797980,11807820," it objective i hate it julia i hate it well actually we we had julia uh recently julia was day 20. uh"
11807820,11809340," this already here i hate this"
11809340,11819260," comedy i hate commodities hello thrash five welcome to the stream so yeah uh we already tried racket as"
11819260,11825020," well if you're talking about uh lisp right so to be fair are we going to consider different kinds of lisp as"
11825020,11832860," different languages that's the interesting question i think we should because they have similar"
11832860,11839500," syntaxes but they have slightly different semantics so if we shouldn't treat different kinds of uh lisps"
11839500,11844700," at different languages we shouldn't treat c and javascript as different languages as well because they"
11844700,11850940," have c syntax c uh c like syntax and slightly different sim i mean semantic is quite dramatically"
11850940,11857500," different but you you see what i mean right so i think they are you know different languages and to"
11857500,11864780," be fair code is that is written in closure cannot be run uh using racket so i think that's quite a good"
11864780,11874460," general criteria because you will have to make too many um too many changes to uh to run a code in closure to"
11874460,11882060," or on on on racket so they are different languages uh and anyway it is time for me to go with it is time"
11882060,11888060," for me to go thanks everyone who's watching right now i really appreciate it have a good one and i see"
