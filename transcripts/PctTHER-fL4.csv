480,5680," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another azuzin session"
5680,13840," so let's make a little announcement and uh fisheries today hello hello welcome welcome welcome"
13840,21840," so uh let's do the usual uh red circle live on twitch and what are we doing today on twitch dot"
21840,28160," at television website uh that's a very very important question of today today we're doing"
28160,32720," typescript computer science that's exactly what we're doing today i'm going to be building to the"
32720,39360," place where we're doing all that uh twitch.tv slash sorting and i'm going to ping everyone who's"
39360,45360," interested in being pinged and there we go the stream has officially started so today we're going"
45360,51440," to continue working on uh autocell the project that we started like a couple of streams ago"
51440,56960," uh right so you can find the source code in here i'm going to copy paste it in the chat um right for"
56960,61920," people on twitch and for people who's watching on youtube it's going to be in the description right"
61920,69440," so basically here we are experimenting with cellular automata uh right and essentially what we are"
69440,75440," trying to do we're trying to take like a conveys game of life style uh cellular automata which uses"
75440,82400," like a moore's neighborhood for uh you know computing the next state of the cell and we're trying to"
82400,90080," generalize this kind of automata uh by introducing the transition table right so instead of like um"
90080,96560," describing cellular automata with the code with if conditions and switch cases and stuff like that"
96560,102000," we introduced um a transition table and that way we can actually uh sort of describe"
103280,110080," uh the cell automata without um writing any actual code like purely with the data of transition table"
110080,115520," so and uh we've already done that right so on one of the previous streams so we can take a look at that"
115520,120720," uh outer cell uh right i'm gonna just rebuild the entire thing just in case we're using typescript for"
120720,127600," all of that right we're using typescript and uh let me start the python web server and that's the web server"
127600,133840," that i use these days even though uh for the for the topic of today's stream it would be actually better"
133840,141120," to use some um some built-in node.js http server right because we're using node.js so it would be"
141120,147200," sort of like on on the theme of of the stream right but i kind of get used to using uh python instead"
147200,152640," because it's just like this is just in my muscle memory uh let's go into the local host i suppose i need"
152640,160880," to refresh we were doing some experiments uh that we'll get into a little bit later right so here i"
160880,169680," suppose uh we just have a setup uh conveys game of life right if we go into the source code there should"
169680,177280," be current uh current automaton yeah actually it's not uh conveys game of life all right it's something"
177280,182240," else so it's actually set it to a game of life all right and it'll have to re rebuild this entire"
182240,190480," thing just in case uh all right i'll have to rebuild just in case so i'm gonna refresh this entire thing"
190480,196480," hopefully uh it is going to be a correct thing so with my chromium you never know if it cached"
196480,201440," the thing or didn't properly cache so i have to first open the dev tools to make sure that it"
201440,206800," doesn't cache anything and i'm gonna put uh some sort of a glider in here right i'm gonna put some sort"
206800,213840," of a gliding here and uh there you go it is a gliding it is a sliding right so and then it should"
213840,218000," be super easy to switch to a different cellular automaton if you take a look at the definition of"
218000,224480," goal it's literally like a json uh thing like it's an array of objects and stuff like that and it describes"
224480,232160," the transitions uh of different states right so uh we have other other things in here so let me take a look"
232160,237760," look so we have a seeds cellular automaton right it's a similar to game of life cellular automaton"
237760,242880," but it's different it's actually way simpler uh right if we take a look at the definitions right it's way"
242880,250480," simpler than game of life right so it basically expects only two alive neighboring cells and it becomes"
250480,256560," alive and if it's alive it just becomes dead so it's a very simple one uh right so let's actually"
256560,265280," recompile this entire thing uh all right all right all right and i'm gonna refresh this entire thing"
265280,273520," and uh let me let me see right so and the the cool thing about seeds is that it's sort of like"
273520,282000," it's a region with a static noise that keeps growing right so the one of the interesting feature of"
282000,286640," the seed cell automaton is just like a region with a static noise with a lot of different static noise"
286640,292000," but it keeps growing until it consumes like everything so that's what uh what what's cool"
292000,297440," about the specific cell automaton right if we try to do that so as you can see like it's a region of"
297440,302560," static noise that just keeps growing and growing and growing until it just consumes everything so it's so"
302560,310640," cool right so there we go and then it consumes everything so the the entire world actually wraps"
310640,315600," around left and right top and bottom right so it's kind of infinite but it's finite in the sense that it"
315600,321840," wraps around uh right another interesting cell automaton that we have is a brian's brain it's kind of"
321840,328720," similar to seeds except it has three states right it has three states instead of one and the third state"
328720,336640," is basically dying and when the cell is alive it becomes not dead but dying and then on the next generation it"
336640,343680," becomes dead right so that way it prevents uh any other new cells being born in that specific place"
343680,349680," for one step right so for one turn specifically so that's basically the difference in here and let's"
349680,355120," actually put some stuff in here so the dying cells i think they're denoted with a green color or we'll see"
355120,361040," yeah there we go and it creates a lot of interesting emergent behavior which actually died out right so let's"
361040,369040," actually try a different stuff in here uh it creates a lot of gliders that are flying uh orthogonally right"
369040,375760," so uh up and down and left and right they rarely actually fly diagonally at least i've never seen them"
375760,382000," flying diagonally but it creates a lot of like gliders which are orthogonal to the axis uh so let's actually"
382000,390160," see there we go it created like one but for some reason i cannot make it explode today right it's already"
390160,395040," second attempt the thing about brian's brain is just it's very explosive right but you have to have"
395040,403440," enough stuff to make it explode uh there we go it created a bunch of gliders right orthogonal maybe"
403440,408160," eventually they will collide with you with each other but they yeah so these ones probably will collide and"
408160,415600," maybe they will create something interesting no they're actually not usually it's super easy to make"
415600,420160," brian's brain explode but not today for some reason not today"
420160,424560," yeah created a bunch of stuff"
424560,434000," yeah it's pretty cool so i should probably do some sort of autoplay right but i'm"
434000,437040," need to spend some time implementing that actually"
437040,444240," uh right so this is a brian's brain so the whole point of this demonstration is that it's super easy to"
444240,451120," replace different seller automaton right automaton uh they're just tables uh right they're just"
451120,456240," these sort of tables uh we coded those tables manually right but because they are transition"
456240,463840," tables they are very easy to uh essentially uh generate procedurally right we can try to generate"
463840,468960," them procedurally and how can we generate them based on what we can generate them so one of the initial"
468960,476960," ideas that i had when i started this entire project is to actually sort of train cellular automaton on"
476960,484160," image on a pixel art image uh right essentially take a pixel art image uh take all of the unique colors"
484160,489840," call them states of cellular automaton then iterate through all of the pixels and look at the neighboring"
489840,498080," ones and based on the neighboring ones uh turn that into uh a cell automaton right maybe feed more images"
498080,504560," into that so the cell automaton actually uh sort of conceptualizes and compresses even more images"
504560,510160," into that and then try to play that thing right so i sort of developed this framework that allows you"
510160,516080," to describe any cell automaton with a moore's neighborhood specifically so i can turn some images"
516080,522880," into cell automaton's automaton uh right and see how they're going to play out we haven't tried that yet so"
522880,528720," this is sort of like an experimentation phase and uh that's what i wanted to do today so we found some"
528720,535200," pretty cool image that i think will work uh for our case right so let me take a look at this entire thing"
535200,541120," uh super quick right so uh we have this right i find it on open game art right so this is a bunch of"
541120,547200," characters which are which i think perfect for uh my idea because we have a limited amount of colors in here and"
547200,553440," we have very pixelated uh characters but they are still readable as characters right so maybe the cell"
553440,558720," automaton will actually reconstruct those things it actually depends on how we're going to construct"
558720,565360," the cell automaton based on these images right so and one of the problems that we had is how can we"
565360,570480," read those the pixels of these images in a browser because all of that stuff is happening in the browser"
570480,575600," right and i was not happy with how uh web people usually do that right i didn't want to work with"
575600,584080," uh image tags and stuff like that and because of that we went on a tangent of actually bringing uh stb"
584080,593280," image dot h into a browser right it's to be image dot h it's a rather famous in game development circles"
593280,600160," library for uh reading images it's just one single header file which allows you to parse pngs jpegs gifs"
600160,605680," and like a lot of stuff it's like 8 000 lines of c code right and it allows you to parse pretty much"
605680,613760," anything including even like a limited subset of photoshop files right so uh and what i did i compiled"
613760,619840," this entire thing to web assembly right so we spent some time streaming and researching how to do that"
619840,625520," that that was not a particularly pleasant experience but we managed to do that uh i created a separate"
625520,634880," library called stb uh i hope i can do anything the file is so big it made the the website lag uh right"
634880,640560," so let me go stb image js so this is the library i created right so essentially what it does it compiles"
640560,647040," stb image into web assembly and it creates a couple of simple bindings for javascript and typescript so you"
647040,654960," can actually uh use it so what it allows you to to do is essentially load an image from url right you see"
654960,661680," it just gives you this function uh which does load from url you provide the url you get a promise"
661680,668480," and you instantly get image data you you instantly get image data without any tags without any off-screen"
668480,674480," canvases or anything like that what it does it downloads the pixels of that specific image it gives"
674480,680080," it to the web assembly module web assembly module actually parses the png or jpeg whatever you have"
680080,686240," and turns it into image data like in one go without modifying dome or like creating something off dome"
686240,691680," or anything like that it just does all of that in web assembly uh right you can find this entire thing in"
691680,700480," here if you're interested so uh it's gonna be here and i'm going to uh give this entire thing to uh youtube"
700480,708800," people as well so stb image js so the cool thing about this library is that uh it's purely uh it's"
708800,714080," purely c library people don't really use this library outside of c projects but we're running this library in"
714080,718560," a browser and this library was not designed to be run in the browser but because of how simple that"
718560,725840," library is it is extremely easy to make it run in a browser right so essentially what i want to start"
725840,734240," with uh like today's stream with is uh adding this library back to the project right and um essentially"
734240,741520," read the image and start analyzing the image and start finally uh try and turn it into uh several automaton so"
741520,747600," that's basically the the plan for the day stream and the idea for the day stream uh all right so let's"
747600,754160," go ahead and uh just actually try to integrate this library into the project back right so we started"
754160,759120," actually by writing this kind of stuff within the project then i separated it and then i'm bringing"
759120,765280," bringing it back so the cool thing is that i actually made it extremely simple so it's literally two"
765280,771280," files right it's a wasm file right so we can actually download it in here uh right i wonder if"
771280,777360," i can just like download it unfortunately i can't this is the download button i cannot see it okay so"
777360,784080," i'm gonna keep the link uh hopefully it will allow me to uh download this entire thing so this is going"
784080,790560," to be an auto cell um maybe i'm going to actually create a wasm folder in here right there we go and"
790560,797200," we're going to try to download stb image wasm right it's a binary file binary wasm file that contains"
797200,804080," everything that we need uh 52 kilobytes right 52 kilobytes it can uh actually build everything"
804080,808320," it can parse everything all the images and stuff like that so you can see it's a web assembly"
808320,815840," binary we're going to keep it in here so the second one is usually the javascript file right so this is"
815840,822240," js file uh but it's compiled from the typescript file so and since our project is a typescript file"
822240,828400," uh i think i'm going to download the typescript one uh right the typescript file is extremely simple it's"
828400,837680," i think yeah it's 50 lines of code literally what it does it just like uh asynchronously loads the wasm file"
837680,844640," that you provided in here uh right and just makes a simple wrapper for uh for the c function so you"
844640,849200," don't have to do the manual memory management right because it's a c library you're supposed to do some"
849200,853680," manual memory management this uh function just does that for you so you don't have to worry about this"
853680,859120," kind of stuff and it doesn't leak any memory by the way uh right so it cleans up everything up to"
859120,867920," up to itself uh all right so i'm gonna use that uh right not the javascript one because for typescript"
867920,874880," project it just makes more sense in my opinion right uh i think in my opinion it does make more"
874880,882480," sense i'm gonna download it in here and i'm gonna put it in here um all right so just a second i forgot"
882480,885520," i need to put yes in here all right"
885520,897040," all right so uh let me try to recompile everything as far as i know if i do tsc it just like looks"
897040,902000," for all of the typescript files within the project right and it compiles all of them so it will compile"
902000,908640," the gs one here as well right hopefully for some reason when i'm streaming the types typescript"
908640,915440," compiler is rather slow uh right okay so to make it actually uh work i'll probably have to include"
915440,923680," the uh stb image stb image js in here as well right so i have to include this entire stuff and let's"
923680,929840," actually start uh i think i already have the uh web server running right do i have web server running i"
929840,937440," think i do so let me confirm that we're actually uh downloading the wasm file right do we download the"
937440,943040," wasm file uh yeah we do okay so it actually downloads the wasm file so everything is okay"
943040,948400," so the thing uh that thing should be able to just like download the image right so let's go ahead and"
948400,956400," see how i can do that so i'm going to go to the index uh right and so where is the entry point so this"
956400,961440," is the entry point so here we're just like uh searching for some nodes in a dome it doesn't really"
961440,968640," matter uh so what i'm going to do stbi can you yes stbi load from url in our case we probably want to"
968640,976400," do url uh so i'm going to be loading cute people uh right loading cute people and specifically we're"
976400,984160," going to be loading this image uh right so and since it returns the promise right if we take a look it"
984160,990000," returns the promise we have to await uh this entire thing and we're going to assign this entire thing"
990000,997120," to cute right and that entire thing is actually literally an image data it's already in image data"
997120,1004560," that you can just already use and here uh you can just slap uh that image data put uh image data"
1004560,1012000," cute at zero zero so we can just like render it on the canvas and that theoretically should work uh but we have"
1012000,1019120," to of course recompile this entire thing just in case we have to recompile all of that all of that"
1019120,1027200," are you going to recompile okay so we didn't compile because this entire function is not"
1027200,1034640," asynchronous right right let's make it async uh there we go so this is this function is async now"
1036800,1044240," let's go so is it recompiling okay so it seems to be recompiling"
1044240,1054080," and it put it on the canvas look at that so right so we managed to load that so but uh what's cool is"
1054080,1059840," that uh since it's an image data we should be able to get the data which is essentially the pixels"
1060480,1065200," right so we can literally just do console log and uh like this"
1065200,1075680," and that means we should be able to analyze the pixels right we should be able to analyze the pixels"
1075680,1084800," so uh let me quickly do the watch mode right so i'm going to actually go in here all right and it's going"
1084800,1090800," in the node bin tsc watch so that means it will keep recompiling like as i edit things"
1090800,1098720," so that's pretty poggers i believe so uh right so it should recompile all of that and as you can see here"
1098720,1106000," is the pixels of the of this entire stuff so the problem is that pixels is a clamped uh clamped u uh u int"
1106000,1112640," array right so that means it's actually multiple of four right it it should be multiple of four if i take"
1112640,1121200," uh the length of the center i think right so it's one two two eight one two two eight eight and then if"
1121200,1127360," i take the uh mode of the center i think it's zero so it's it's divisible by four right so we need to"
1127360,1134640," turn it into u int32 array somehow the last time i tried to do that i think it didn't really work the"
1134640,1142480," way i expected it to work right if i literally just uh rub this entire thing like so i think it's gonna it's"
1142480,1152640," not gonna divide um the uh the size by two i don't think it's going to work the way i think it will"
1152640,1158240," work right so let me actually do something like this uh yeah so as you can see it stayed the same"
1158240,1164160," so if it would actually turn it into like u int array it would basically uh divide it by four but i"
1164160,1170320," don't really know what's up with that so we got this up uh thank you so much uh key jagatka for"
1170320,1175840," tier one subscription with the message now i can backseat even in subscribe only mode okay sure"
1175840,1181680," people are like literally paying money to backseat me that's very interesting"
1181680,1186160," is it that is it that enjoyable to backseat me i don't understand"
1189280,1197680," so what's appealing in backseat me i don't understand because uh when i watch somebody's"
1197680,1202320," streams which i rarely do actually these days because which is unbearable right when i watch"
1202320,1207280," somebody streams like i don't have a single urge to backseat anyone it's just like i don't feel like"
1207280,1213760," doing that i'm more interested in watching how uh the the streamer approaches the problem even if i see"
1213760,1220640," how i could solve that i'm still curious about the way they're solving it right so i don't really"
1220640,1223040," understand the appeal but people seem to like that"
1226560,1235680," yeah what's up um all right so uh i don't really know uh why how to convert this thing into u int 32"
1235680,1242560," array because i remember if i just had something like this right because i remember giving you uh"
1242560,1251520," you int 8 array to uh you in 32 array and it would actually cut it in half right so what if i try to do"
1251520,1257760," something like this will that work no it didn't work actually um so i think um"
1257760,1264400," i think it has to be an array buffer right so if i take a look array buffer"
1264400,1274800," right can i construct an array buffer out of the out of this thing is that something i can do"
1274800,1280960," looks like this is something i can do but i'm not 100 sure i think i need to enable the fly check mode"
1280960,1287760," okay so it complains about cute uh so what's up with that argument uh is not assignable to a type number"
1287760,1292400," oh okay this one is interesting so this is an array buffer"
1292400,1301760," so it simply cannot do that so array buffer uh i suppose expects a number all right we can give it"
1301760,1311840," a number we can give it a number right so and it doesn't like the length because the length does not"
1311840,1319200," exist for for this entire thing well i mean it's probably data right okay so we have a buffer can i"
1319200,1327680," then just do something like you int eight uh clamped array for the buffer and just set uh cute data is that"
1327680,1335200," something i can do i think i can and then i'm going to try to construct uh you int 32 array out of this"
1335200,1340880," entire thing so all that so far compiles and if i refresh this and i think it actually you know divided"
1340880,1346560," it by four right and multiply by four yeah so that's that's how you have to do that which is rather weird"
1348320,1357120," right so you literally have to copy it um so because if you just try to put cute data in here"
1357120,1363600," right just to put cute data in here it is not going to uh like you know divided by four right it will take"
1363600,1371680," each individual byte and expand each individual byte into four bytes instead so to make it not expand that"
1371680,1379920," you act actually have to create a separate array buffer right separate array buffer and then copy this"
1379920,1386240," entire thing and only then you have to do which is kind of weird isn't it that is extremely weird"
1388240,1395680," can i view the data as the buffer okay i i can view it as a buffer so that means i should be able to just"
1395680,1404560," do cute data buffer yeah okay so i can just take you int uh that's actually pretty cool uh buffer array"
1404560,1409920," like buffer okay let's see if that solves that problem okay so that's a much simpler way of doing"
1409920,1414640," that all right because i was kind of worried that this is like the only way to do that and it's just like"
1414640,1418800," really really dumb uh let's take a look at the bytes themselves right let's take a look at the"
1418800,1424640," bytes themselves do they actually look like the pixels they do kind of look like pixels not gonna"
1424640,1430640," lie uh some of them are zero and some of them like pretty big but it would make sense if we if we could"
1430640,1436720," view them as hex if you know what i mean right it would be kind of cool if we view them as hex let's"
1436720,1442800," actually put pixels in here right so this is the pixels can i just like do uh let's say four iterations"
1442800,1448800," right so we're gonna do four iterations and uh we're gonna just like console log uh a bunch of things"
1448800,1455600," in here like a pixels i uh there we go um right so slow network"
1455600,1461520," how i'm on a local network what the are you talking about"
1461520,1468240," maybe it was the network lag after all"
1469440,1472800," i think that was the network lag after all boys and girls yes"
1472800,1479440," look at that look at that look at that local host"
1479440,1497440," slow freaking network detected you freaking"
1499120,1503360," domestic horse has failed you yeah thank you so much all right we'll get a sub"
1503360,1505840," uh thank you so much for the twitch"
1505840,1511760," fried twitch prime solution phi cqr i hope for pricing nickname correctly thank you thank you thank you"
1511760,1519600," really appreciate at that uh so the question is how can i convert that to hex is there anything like hex"
1519600,1528800," like um okay so let's actually google that javascript uh number as hex right how can you"
1528800,1535280," how can you even do that how to convert decimal to hex in javascript okay let's find out let's find that"
1535280,1545200," uh let's uh i find out so oh it's a two string 16 all right so two string uh 16"
1545200,1550880," q uh what do we have in here and it's actually eliminated the slow network"
1551840,1557920," that's right that's right so two string 16 actually speeds up your network right so if you remove to"
1557920,1565920," string 16 uh well i mean okay i don't know what caused that i think my laptop is literally dying"
1565920,1573440," already uh is there any way i can pad this entire thing right i wonder i think the string itself had"
1573440,1581600," something for padding yeah pad uh start and uh how they specify so max length uh let's say the max"
1581600,1588000," length is going to be since it's um right it has to be like eight right so that's what we're gonna have"
1588000,1593520," and uh we're gonna fill all of that with zero right so that's how we're gonna be doing all that"
1593520,1599280," there we go there we go that's what i'm talking about can i do something like to uppercase i can do"
1599280,1607520," something to uppercase and now look at that it looks like hexadecimal strisa perfect actually"
1607520,1613680," perfect so i know how to sort of like display uh display the pixels right so that's actually pretty"
1613680,1618880," cool uh right i'm gonna save this entire thing because i'm probably gonna be reusing all that"
1618880,1623600," so the thing i want to do now is i'm going i want to iterate all the pixels for now right so i'm"
1623600,1632160," going to start from here pixels uh length uh plus plus i right and i want to have uh you know the the"
1632160,1642240," object like unique pixels right unique pixels something like this uh if unique pixels uh pixels i"
1642240,1651520," is equal undefined uh we're going to essentially set this entire thing to one otherwise we're going"
1651520,1661120," to be incrementing it by uh one right so in the main um question the main question so what's oh it"
1661120,1667680," doesn't know what what's up with that so let's say that the key here is it's supposed to be a number"
1667680,1673200," right it's supposed to be a number but i think it will work and it's a number from number to number"
1673200,1678560," right so it should be fine uh right it's complaints about this thing so what's up with that"
1678560,1686880," expect it oh yeah god damn it's like i'm i'm i've been programming in all of this modern zoomer"
1686880,1692160," programming languages where you don't have to put uh parenthesis around like if condition and it's just"
1692160,1696800," like a kind of kind of good use to that because it makes sense and now i got back to this boomer javascript"
1696800,1701440," right that requires you to put this parenthesis in there and just like oh my god"
1701440,1712400," oh my god okay so uh let's take a look at uh some other stuff right so let's take a look at the length"
1712400,1720240," of the unique uh pixels is there any way for me to i think it's entries right or uh keys i think it's"
1720240,1728160," something like keys and then length is that how it works i'm not sure actually uh so javascript um"
1728160,1737440," count keys of object i keep forgetting actually i keep forgetting how to do it so uh how to efficiently"
1737440,1744080," why efficiently just just somehow i don't really need efficiency right now i just like need somehow to do"
1744080,1751520," that uh all right so there's the keys uh and i suppose that's one of the things we can do in here"
1751520,1757680," right so then we can just take the length of this entire thing a boom a boom that should work somehow"
1757680,1768720," uh right so let's refresh this entire stuff 11 11 right and that's what i'm talking about there's not"
1768720,1775520," that many unique uh unique keys in here right there's not that many of them uh right so one of"
1775520,1779600," the things we probably want to do now we probably want to iterate through them right so is there any"
1779600,1788000," way for me to say something like uh pixel uh in right and uh just go ahead and log this entire thing"
1788000,1794480," um it's probably either off or in i don't quite remember right so it could be just like an index uh but"
1794480,1800400," we can always just like you know uh yeah it is an index so i have to do something like off yeah there"
1800400,1808640," we go now we're freaking talking okay and i'm going to be using this magic in here all right to turn it"
1808640,1816480," into hex so we can see the actual unique uh things in here so this one doesn't really like 16 are you"
1817680,1826400," expected zero but cut got one are you freaking serious my friend how is that even possible is that because"
1826400,1830560," um pixels"
1830560,1838880," huh wait a freaking second so this this string is of number"
1841360,1849200," so it does not consider pixel and because it's a string it automatically converted this entire shit"
1849200,1860080," to string you you know what i have an idea actually i have an idea what if i like do that in here"
1860080,1870080," right so i say this is the color of the pixel right so that's the color of the pixel and we actually"
1870080,1875280," accept yeah so i think objects they're kind of like expect you to have strings in here um"
1875280,1882160," keys always return to this kind of stuff that sucks"
1882160,1884320," choice"
1884320,1891120," choice absolute choice but i think this should this should work right and instead of like pixels in"
1891120,1896080," here we're gonna literally use colors because it's gonna be unique anyway right it's going to be unique"
1896080,1900960," anyway uh all right so let's try to refresh this entire thing and there we go here are the course"
1900960,1909840," and what's cool is that it's cool is that we'll be able to straight up use this as the style for"
1909840,1915440," rendering this kind of stuff right because i want to match the color of the state with the color of the"
1915440,1922160," pixel in the original image and in the transition table right uh auto right so we have a transition table and"
1922160,1928640," stuff like that um right we actually have associated core with the current state"
1928640,1934320," uh with the current state uh please watch your language oh i'm sorry like i keep forgetting that"
1934320,1939840," uh germany is actually according to my analytics germany is the second country most like that that"
1939840,1947120," watches me right at the top is usa and uh second one is germany right it shouldn't actually i shouldn't"
1947120,1951120," actually swear in german i'm sorry even though i don't speak german i don't know why i do that it's"
1951120,1959680," just like it's such a such a such a satisfying word to say i think right but i just love it for some"
1959680,1966640," uh german language uh german language is beautiful uh anyways"
1966640,1976880," swear in italian uh what fun cool i don't really know uh too many italian swear words i'm sorry"
1976880,1983680," um hello hello hello people are watching me from all over all over the world"
1985680,1991120," love from antarctica you guys you guys got internet in antarctica uh all right"
1991120,1999280," so uh let me see let me see so we've got these things so that means i can just like literally use"
1999280,2007200," this stuff in uh in a style but the problem here is that uh the colors are inverted right so here first"
2007200,2017120," comes the alpha right first comes the alpha and then uh blue green and red and this is because we're"
2017120,2025040," working with the least significant um with basically lsb order of bytes right so with lsb order of bytes"
2025040,2032640," and essentially to use this as the color i'll need to revert the bytes right i'll need to revert the bytes"
2032640,2039520," somehow and i'm thinking what's going to be the easiest way to actually do that right look at that"
2039520,2046080," look at that it's a spaceship this is a spaceship how do i like my spaceship i think it's a pretty cool spaceship"
2048480,2063040," uh anyways so um so where is the the entry point uh so one of the ways we can do that one of the ways we"
2063040,2074240," can do that we can try to invert all of that on the level of uh bytes like literally bytes or we can try to"
2074240,2080720," analyze the pixels on the level of yeah we can actually try to analyze all of that on the level"
2080720,2086640," like by four bytes or something like that uh that would be rather interesting i think so that means"
2086640,2090800," we shouldn't really convert uh all that stuff into you in 32"
2095200,2099440," we shouldn't convert all of that stuff into you in 32"
2099440,2113280," i'm just thinking because uh you can just uh do something like function reverse number right just a"
2113280,2122160," reverse number uh right actually we can say reverse you in 32 right and"
2124880,2131600," the the problem with this kind of approach right the problem with this kind of approach is that uh x"
2131600,2139920," oh yeah so 32 bit value actually fits perfectly in here so i shouldn't even worry about this kind"
2139920,2145840," of stuff right so because it's literally uh 32. so let's introduce something like y it's initially"
2145840,2154080," going to be zero and uh what i want to do effectively in here is just uh iterate four times right"
2154560,2163520," so something like this essentially let's imagine that i have uh something like a a b b g g r r right"
2163520,2171360," so i have something like this so and uh this is x by the way this is x by uh doing something like mode"
2171360,2180640," uh mode 255 this is a 255 in hexadecimal right by doing something like that uh x mode"
2181520,2188240," uh well i mean i can just put it in here i actually extract r right i actually extract r"
2188240,2196240," so extract this specific part right so uh this particular thing will be equal to uh this entire"
2196240,2202800," thing i can even do something like and right so it will work like a mask right it will work like a mask"
2202800,2212400," so then what i can do effectively here i can just um merge that mass mask with y like so and that way i"
2212400,2220240," actually moved uh sort of r to here right i move that r to here and since i'm going to be doing that in a"
2220240,2227040," loop right i want to then uh remove that single byte from x right so i want to just do something like x"
2227760,2234880," move to eight and that effectively removes that byte from here right so and it would probably make sense"
2234880,2243760," to actually leave some space to the next byte in here uh like so uh and that yeah so essentially what"
2243760,2250240," we're doing in here we're popping this byte from x and we pushing it into y right that's what we're doing in"
2250240,2257520," here and that will effectively reverse you in 32 and here we have to actually return uh return y"
2257520,2262960," so we we have a little bit of like a bit magic in here but it doesn't really have to be a bit magic"
2262960,2267840," believe it or not it doesn't really have to be a bit magic because we can just replace it with division"
2267840,2275040," uh actually this one has to be mod uh this one is multiply by ff right this one is plus"
2275920,2282080," we can even do something like this right so it doesn't have to be beat uh and here we divide by ff"
2282080,2289520," right and that's how we do that so it's kind of an interesting thing right yeah it's kind of an"
2289520,2297360," interesting thing because uh so the bit operations should be more efficient but we're talking about v8"
2297360,2304800," i wonder does the v8 compiler optimize this kind of stuff does the v8 compiler optimize this kind of"
2304800,2315920," stuff it's a very interesting question so it's a very interesting question uh all right so let's uh"
2315920,2321440," actually find out it's kind of difficult to check with this kind of stuff right because in case of the"
2321440,2326960," like actual not toy programming language but a real programming language that are statically typed and"
2326960,2332960," compiled uh you could use godbolt just to view what kind of assembly they generated in case of a toy"
2332960,2339120," language just like javascript i'm not sure is there any tools that let you view the assembly that the"
2339120,2346800," uh the jit compiler actually generates right but i'm not sure because this is a toy language right so i'm"
2346800,2354240," not sure if such serious tools are even exposed for such language maybe not um so"
2354240,2367120," i swear yesterday you said who the hell use does use bitwise operations in 2023"
2367120,2375920," welcome to the coding channel all right so uh let me see"
2376800,2388800," uh thank you for uh you know for the engagement in the chat i really appreciate that so um what we're"
2388800,2396640," gonna say so i think this will work uh let's try to recompile this now so i don't think i have to uh"
2396640,2402480," print byte code maybe node print byte code does it even exist uh i'm actually really curious"
2404080,2419920," need help uh print by it doesn't exist okay so let's refresh this into i think and uh"
2419920,2427040," maybe this is one of the reasons why you have to use bit operations in this specific"
2432080,2435120," oh anyway so uh"
2435120,2442640," uh all right so uh what i want you to do in here right so this is gonna be"
2442640,2449040," i swear to god people are not running the program in this language oh"
2459840,2478800," okay okay so this is not a particularly great idea i suppose uh i'm gonna go the other route right i'm"
2478800,2486160," gonna go the other route uh of essentially just analyzing everything by four bytes right because"
2486160,2493280," essentially what i have uh what they have in here right what i have in here is uh basically a sequence"
2493280,2500880," of bytes right so i basically need to analyze them by by force right right not how to say that four"
2500880,2513760," by four sit not not by force but by force right so ah it's yeah you guys are right i supposed to put 100 i'm"
2513760,2520640," i'm sorry so thank you thank you thank you so much yeah what the fuck is this shit anyway um"
2520640,2527600," so uh i think it will be better to actually analyze them by by force so"
2531040,2536560," this one is why why why is it why why is it why why is it why why is it why why is it why why why is it like that"
2536560,2546640," anyway um so let's do by force right so this is going to be four and i think uh i'm going to"
2546640,2555280," like literally use this uh directly right so this is going to be direct thing uh we don't have a length for some reason"
2556000,2562720," uh i'm not sure why where is length why can't i just get the length of the of the clamped thingy"
2562720,2568720," uh is that because i have to do data i think that's because i have to do data maybe i'm going to just do"
2568720,2576480," data like so right and if i understand correctly this is length of the oh my god a clamped array"
2576480,2580960," right so this is a clamped array and here instead of this kind of thing i'm going to be doing uh"
2580960,2589120," four right so we're gonna like increment by four we can increment by four so the next thing we are going"
2589120,2600160," to do all right so i think is i'm going to just eight clamped array and i wonder if i can just do pixels uh"
2600160,2609920," pixels i4 uh will that create the um uh the thing right so this is a single pixel right so this is a"
2609920,2617360," single pixel and here uh here we don't really need this function anymore i don't really need this function"
2617360,2625520," anymore and let's say that um you know bytes as hex string right so here we're going to accept the"
2625520,2632720," bytes which is you int uh clamped array right so this is a unit clamped array and uh we're going to"
2632720,2639440," return to do right so it's not finished here uh so essentially here right essentially here what we're"
2639440,2648400," going to do is just doing bytes as hex and we can just pass the pixel in there right and that creates"
2648400,2653360," the color and we're going to be using that color specifically for all of that stuff in here so we"
2653360,2661120," need some sort of a result right so the result is going to be just this uh right and let's iterate the"
2661600,2667040," the bytes uh the bytes of bytes i wonder if i can do shit like that i should be able to do it like that"
2667040,2677600," anyway so bytes i want to do two string can i actually yeah boy yeah boy to um to upper right"
2677600,2683920," maybe i also have to do pad start uh it's going to be two this is going to be zero all right and what i'm"
2683920,2689600," going to do in here i'm going to be appending that to the result and that way i'm actually iterating"
2689600,2697040," all of that stuff in um in the usual order which will not change anything right which will not change"
2697040,2704640," anything but we are talking about a sequence of bytes we're talking about a sequence of bytes which"
2704640,2711840," makes it super easy to reverse later right which makes it super easy to reverse later so does it work i"
2711840,2721120," i didn't see it working anyhow uh so we did it actually uh what is going on it is it is hanging"
2721120,2727760," it is actually hanging right so i'm not really sure uh so it feels like maybe"
2727760,2736640," it is not working the way i expect it to work uh all right so yeah it feels like it just it just hanged"
2736640,2744400," uh let me let me let me close this entire stuff so where why would it hang though why would it hang"
2744400,2750480," is that because i cannot do that or maybe uh if i try to recompile uh everything seems to be fine"
2757360,2763680," right so uh right so uh there we go follow network of course"
2763680,2773120," all right so uh let me think let me think i'm not quite sure like it's like"
2773120,2783840," nothing actually tells me that this would be a problem um right what if i just"
2785360,2792000," uh put something like foo in here and illuminate the call to the bytes as hex"
2792000,2796560," right i just eliminate this entire call uh because maybe that's the reason"
2796560,2804640," uh why it is hanging yeah that's the reason why it is okay and it printed full as soon as i call to this"
2804640,2811120," function it hangs right but i don't understand why would it hang so the only reason why i think it would"
2811120,2817760," hang is because i mean you cannot do that simply simply put uh all right so let's actually try to"
2817760,2828000," rewrite this entire thing i don't know uh like i zero less bytes uh length uh plus plus i sure i'm gonna"
2828000,2834080," actually keep it in here uh is that the reason is that the actual reason because i i can't believe that"
2834080,2838320," that could be a reason uh okay so there are some problems in here but"
2838320,2848480," yeah that's the reason it's just like it's"
2854640,2867120," i'm i'm puzzled i'm really really puzzled like am i all right so what is going on excuse me uh can you"
2867120,2878080," just log the size of this thing why is it too long i i can't believe that like i can't believe that it's"
2878080,2883040," just like not as straightforward what the fuck is going on i have no idea"
2883040,2889200," uh okay uh so i should probably yeah i wanted to do"
2889200,2896960," well it's printing something okay sure it actually okay"
2898880,2909360," you cannot take a slice of clamped i swear to god i swear to god you you int8 clamped array is cursed"
2909360,2916000," like what is what is clamped array right why it behaves in such a weird way"
2916000,2924080," it it is so weird to me like it doesn't behave like any of the uint arrays maybe i just don't understand"
2924080,2931280," what this array means type to represent array of eight bytes integers clumped right it's behavior"
2931280,2937280," its behavior diverges from any arrays that are not clamped and it's just like so weird to me like it"
2937280,2943520," always i was trying to make a slice out of that and it it's not slice it's not slicing it this way"
2943520,2952880," like it is not slicing it this way it's just like so weird uh right so clamped array so let me read"
2952880,2960240," about it it's just is there something special about it um it's a troll data structure yeah exactly right"
2960240,2967440," because if you feed it into your int32 array it doesn't truncate it uh it doesn't divide the size by"
2967440,2975600," four right so it literally expands this in like each individual byte into four bytes if it's not clamp"
2975600,2981760," it will not do that and it's just like it's not obvious from the names of the structures that it will"
2981760,2993040," act like that uh right so so unscentages clamped to right so the name only implies that the values are"
2993040,2999760," going to be always just clamped to the bytes right it doesn't imply all of these weird other behaviors"
2999760,3008320," that i encounter every time i work with this particular structure right so it's just so weird to me i honestly"
3008320,3018000," do not understand right it's just like why does it be here um so right because usually if you have you"
3018000,3023360," int 8 array and you're just trying to take a slice out of this entire thing you're just trying to take"
3023360,3029600," a slice out of the distance i think it would be size 4. right i can even try that right so if i just like"
3029600,3032160," put it like that uh all right"
3032160,3043120," console log uh new int 8 pixels 4 length"
3044800,3053360," and it's just and it's always something that i don't expect it's always with this data structure"
3053360,3060080," that i don't expect it's just like dude why are you like that why are you like that"
3060080,3070720," yeah yeah exactly it didn't slice it it didn't fucking slice it it's just so bizarre"
3073920,3083600," so why are they who designed all of this who is the designer of all of these you"
3083600,3090640," int 8s you in 32s array buffers and all that weird fucking who designed all of that"
3090640,3100960," i swear to god it's so bad oh my god and then and then people complain boo who see heart i don't"
3100960,3108640," understand this is worse this is worse than c like this is literally worse than c like in c"
3108640,3113680," this kind of stuff just makes sense they're all hanging out in starbucks yeah"
3113680,3123360," uh we've got some subs thank you so much temple cloud for gifting five uh community subs thank you"
3123360,3128800," thank you thank you thank you really appreciate it i swear to god and it's always something stupid and"
3128800,3136880," unexpected in the web and it's just like oh my god why why would you design this like that it's so bad"
3136880,3143280," all right so that means i have to go back to the drawing board and redesign my route"
3144000,3151680," between different byte rates slightly differently right so there's this route of how to convert"
3151680,3158480," one bytes arrays to another bytes array so this route was a failure one let's redesign that route sure"
3158480,3166960," okay it's where to god uh okay so image data what do we have in here so we have a un clamped array"
3167840,3176640," so we can probably start with the buffer right so uh yeah let me actually remove that so cute data"
3176640,3184320," buffer uh so because of that can i take the length of the and i can't take the length of the array like"
3184320,3190000," buffer but i can take the length of this thing yeah okay so but if i'm going to be doing this kind of"
3190000,3197360," thing can i just make it an array uh can i just make it an array without this kind of thing uh okay so will"
3197360,3206800," you work thank you thank you right but i wonder if you if you just do clamped clamped"
3209440,3215680," it's gonna be four it's gonna be four but if you just do that it's still compilable it's gonna be this"
3215680,3220960," how is it making sense it's just"
3220960,3234560," how how who designed this who designed it it's so bizarre i swear to god it is so bizarre"
3236160,3242400," anyway okay so i think this is less of a failure route i think that and it just always hits you"
3242400,3248000," like a truck right you never expect from from what corner this kind of shit is gonna like"
3248000,3254640," you know knock you down right it's just oh no excuse me when you convert array buffer"
3254640,3258720," from the clamped it actually doesn't clamp it because blah blah blah the standard"
3261440,3262720," yeah yeah sure"
3262720,3278800," i'm going insane it's just like oh my god and people internalize this shit and people defend this"
3278800,3288480," shit on twitter and on youtube they like it they love it they are defending that"
3289120,3295360," literally stockholm syndrome literally my god okay"
3295360,3310400," all right so what i want you to do uh buy this hex so this time this time i can actually take uh you"
3310400,3314480," into the entire but so there's a reason for all of that because"
3314480,3318640," don't you see it"
3318640,3326720," okay sorry"
3326720,3329120," uh so"
3333440,3341360," so it seems a good uh the life this shit for you i mean i if it pays money if it pays the bills"
3341360,3346640," right if it buys them good coffee at starbucks i can see why they would like it"
3346640,3356320," i couldn't i didn't know you could speak gibberish my native tongue oh yeah"
3357600,3363920," um there's no good coffee at starbucks i've no idea i've never been in starbucks actually so"
3363920,3368000," i live in russia my comrade we don't have starbucks"
3368000,3375520," we have red starbucks i'm sorry anyway"
3382000,3384800," this should work i think i think i think this should work"
3384800,3392560," do we have any errors we don't have any errors and"
3392560,3400000," okay it's all it's all zero it actually all turned out to be zero so that all right"
3402080,3408400," that didn't work as well we don't really know why yet"
3408400,3418560," we don't really know why yet but that didn't work uh i wonder if i uh can convert it to a string"
3418560,3428080," is it possible okay so it is possible uh-huh all of them oh yeah i see i see so i forgot to put i"
3428080,3437440," in here all right almost i almost had a heart attack after after this trauma of converting between"
3437440,3442960," clamped arrays and buffers and not clamped arrays and buffers and realizing that there is a difference"
3442960,3450080," in behavior because the starbucks people decided so and i'm stupid uh i thought i'm i encountered yet"
3450080,3456160," another traumatizing experience i just forgot to put i instead of zero okay everything's fine the situation"
3456160,3464720," have saved has been saved has been saved okay so uh all right okay this is what i wanted to see yeah"
3464720,3479520," all right so uh now we want to actually call uh the starbucks people the starbucks people are coming"
3480960,3485600," oh"
3485600,3490400," look why why why my local host is slow again"
3490400,3498800," i should never touch any of the web technologies ever in my life like holy it's just like it just"
3498800,3505920," doesn't work for me this is probably because i don't have a starbucks you know what this is because the"
3505920,3510960," starbucks closed in russia that's probably why if we had a starbucks the it industry in russia would"
3510960,3512000," would have not collapsed"
3512000,3521600," all people say that the the it industry in russia collapsed because of the sanctions and post on"
3521600,3528400," yandex no no this is the it industry in russia collapsed because the starbucks left that's what"
3529280,3534720," because without the starbucks none of this works it's just like doesn't work by by definition so you"
3534720,3541440," need the starbucks for this kind of stuff so yeah the pumpkin spice latte yeah so without the pumping"
3541440,3546000," pumpkin spice latte is just like doesn't work so that's the that's the most powerful"
3546000,3550720," sanction you can apply to anyone is just like close the starbucks instantly the entire"
3550720,3554160," info it infrastructure just collapsed so"
3554160,3564960," is industry in russia of course don't you see like i'm in in the middle of ruins right nothing works"
3564960,3575120," my my local host is slower than my external connection the whole in it infrastructure collapsed"
3575120,3582240," inside of my local laptop so everything is collapsing anyway so"
3582240,3593600," finally uh after an hour of work i managed to analyze unique pixels i managed to analyze unique"
3593600,3599600," pixels and actually even convert them to colors i actually managed to convert them into colors one of"
3599600,3606240," the things i would like to do by the way chat is to draw these specific unique score unique colors"
3606240,3612560," uh like on the canvas so we can see all of the unique colors in here i think that will be actually"
3612560,3619600," kind of cool uh right so let's um take the width of the canvas right so if i remember correctly the width"
3619600,3627280," of the canvas is app width right so app is the canvas and we can take its width so uh then we can take"
3627280,3634720," uh the colors right so the colors is basically unique pixels unique uh pixels object keys right"
3634720,3639440," uh so this is object key so this is how many like colors we have in here we're going to take the"
3639440,3644560," colors and we're going to divide by the length of this entire thing and this is effectively the size"
3644560,3648400," of a single like cell in which we're going to draw all of the colors right so let's actually call"
3648400,3656000," something like cell uh cell size right so this is sort of like a cell size okay so and let's iterate"
3656000,3664720," through all the colors right so let color of colors right let color of course and uh let's just do ctx"
3664720,3672240," uh feel style right and we're going to set the color of that unique pixel to the feel style"
3672240,3678880," though we probably also have to uh put uh the hash thing in here right so because otherwise it doesn't"
3678880,3685040," read like uh like an actual style right so you're supposed to use like a you know camel case or some"
3685040,3690160," shit like that i don't know another web developer so and the next thing we need to do we need to feel"
3690160,3694640," uh wrecked right so we need to feel right we're going to start at zero actually no"
3694640,3700960," can i have indices and values simultaneously in javascript"
3703280,3707440," starbucks people can i can i have that"
3707440,3715040," okay so probably have to do like this"
3715680,3726480," there's entries but i already have an array so"
3726480,3736720," anyway so we're going to start with what uh x it's basically i multiplied by the cell size right so this"
3736720,3742560," is x position of the x in terms of y let's keep it zero right so it's going to be the first row"
3742560,3748640," then uh width and height is going to be cell uh size and cell size right there we go so that should work"
3749680,3764480," so i didn't work what's up with that uh so left hand any"
3764480,3774400," ended up with a boomer s c loop"
3777040,3785440," anyway uh so let's uh let's continue look at that these are all of the unique colors"
3785440,3787680," of that image isn't that pog"
3787680,3796240," look at them colors look at the colors"
3796240,3806320," yeah boy yeah boy so if we take a look at the original image actually right so if we take a look"
3806320,3811520," at the original image uh so i probably have to use the fact right"
3811520,3821440," and i probably have to do some yeah so these are this is the image that we're analyzing right"
3821440,3829280," uh and these are the calls this is a very cool palette i'll give you that so the props to the"
3829280,3835920," author of this uh specific piece uh the palette is actually very satisfying i really like it it does"
3835920,3841920," feel like um yeah it does feel like a terminal thing all right it does feel like a terminal thing"
3841920,3844480," so that's actually kind of cool all right"
3844480,3856080," uh all right so essentially we've got a list of all the potential states right we've got a list of all"
3856080,3863200," all the potential states uh so and that means we can already kind of generate uh some of the stuff right"
3863200,3870000," so uh automaton right so automaton is actually uh an array of states and each state is the transition"
3870000,3875360," table right it's it's a transition table so we can already just basically say okay so how many uh unique"
3875360,3881680," pixels you have just create that many uh transitions in here so but the transitions themselves how can we"
3883120,3893920," sort of um how can we create them right one of the uh ways i was thinking how we can uh do all of that"
3893920,3903920," so let me actually see um yeah so i'm gonna do it like that we can take one specific image right we can take"
3903920,3912080," one specific image and maybe start from the uh left upper corner right from the left upper corner right"
3912080,3917920," and for instance here we have just like an empty thing and we're gonna leave it as it is right and"
3917920,3926000," then uh we go to the uh basically the next one in here right we're gonna ignore everything to the right"
3926640,3933840," and uh bottom and diagonal in here we're only gonna analyze maybe something to the left up and diagonal"
3933840,3941200," there and essentially look how many neighbors we have in there and for this specific amount of neighbors"
3941200,3947680," we're gonna make a transition from an empty one to this one and we're gonna try to analyze all of that"
3947680,3953600," diagonally like so diagonally like so creating transitions for diagonal for the for the entire"
3953600,3960240," picture hoping that maybe it will create a cellular automaton that recreates the original picture"
3960240,3966160," or maybe not so i don't really know how it's going to work out but this is basically an idea"
3966160,3972640," another idea as i had is to create a stable cell automaton basically take a picture and for each pixel"
3972640,3979280," in here create a rule with this amount of neighbors stay in that state always right and if uh then you"
3979280,3986160," can place this entire configuration uh onto the canvas and it will stay stable because the cell automaton"
3986160,3992320," is actually like will basically keep it stable and then we can try to maybe remove one of the pixels"
3992320,3996960," and see how it falls apart or something that's actually a very interesting idea"
3998480,4005920," huh i really like that so maybe this is the first thing that we can try to do right so basically take"
4005920,4012720," one character uh right and make a stable cell automaton that just preserves this picture"
4012720,4018560," right and then try to like change something and see how it falls apart maybe uh right"
4018560,4024480," so that's actually kind of cool right but to do that we probably need to"
4024480,4031520," separate all of these things into like smaller pictures right is there any way by the way to"
4031520,4038800," split the image data into into smaller image data that's a very interesting question right so if i"
4038800,4045760," already have an image data is there something i can do to make a smaller image data all right so this is the"
4045760,4053440," the image data uh all right so already have that so there is a predefined color space i feel like"
4053440,4060640," i feel like there could be some problems with that but we can google that up a little bit later"
4060640,4067120," uh we can google that up a little bit later all right so and i want to make a cup of tea"
4067120,4077440," uh so to do that we'll need to make a small break um so okay go um i guess the time has come to"
4077440,4087600," continue with this thing right so let's continue um i really like to split this into like separate images"
4088720,4094240," uh but i don't know how to do that with image data right how how can i do that with image data maybe"
4094240,4100080," the time has come to ask chat a ccp"
4112640,4128480," uh hello mr c uh i have uh image data how can i split it into sub images into sub images"
4128480,4136320," yeah wait what is this this is a chat as python code"
4140160,4146720," this is chat ccp i don't have an access to chat gpt because uh openly i banned it in my country"
4146720,4153120," i can only have an access to chat ccp right so it's a chinese website which is also like a front"
4153120,4158960," end for gtp gpt 3.5 but i have an access to it at least uh right so i should have actually specified"
4158960,4166160," that i wanted javascript right so it didn't like it's it's it thought i'm talking about peel we thought"
4166160,4172400," i'm talking about peel okay i'm gonna i'm gonna delete your message right we should start over i"
4172400,4184720," think i think we should start over let's delete it uh all right so um sub images uh i have in javascript"
4185280,4192160," in browser uh into sub images also image let us"
4192160,4199840," hello i can definitely help you with that to split image global okay"
4213520,4221600," i see what you i see what you mean by uh by that so you want to do that through the context"
4221600,4231360," uh this one then looks better than gptmo well yeah by the way you can give it a try it the cool thing"
4231360,4237760," uh about this thing is that it doesn't require any uh authentication you can just like open it up and use"
4237760,4242000," it you don't have to log in or anything like that and it's probably gonna be closed in in a month"
4243520,4250960," right it's just like one of this it's it's a chat gpt from wish right that's what it is"
4250960,4254960," it's a chat gpt from wish it's just like it's we have chat gpt at home that's what it is"
4254960,4259840," and they probably read your messages yes so"
4259840,4267840," so i know that uh these messages are going to be read personally by xi jinping so that's why i address them"
4267840,4275520," like that um is github copilot also probably i never checked it right um"
4275520,4285760," all right so it basically suggests to do get image data so you can basically take sub images over but it"
4285760,4292240," it's from the canvas so here is the thing it's from the canvas so if we do uh get uh image data"
4294160,4301040," uh yeah yeah so and it allows me to get the sub images but the canvas image data is not image data"
4301040,4308880," if you know what i mean uh right so if i take a look at the image data itself i simply cannot do this kind"
4308880,4320080," of stuff right does that mean i have to do that stupid trick of the off-screen canvas again the same trick i was"
4320080,4330400," trying to avoid all the time is that what you're telling me um so uh let me uh let me see so"
4330400,4333200," hmm"
4333200,4349040," so what uh uh i don't have a canvas i only have image data how can i split"
4350560,4352800," it into smaller image"
4352800,4365680," i see in that case you can create new image data object to represent each sub image here an example okay"
4369840,4374240," sub image widths you can create new image"
4374240,4388240," oh this is the this is the painful code this is probably the most painful code i've ever read holy"
4388240,4397440," not even pixel by pixel but bite by bite"
4397440,4403600," this is a pure torture really"
4411120,4416240," okay okay okay so let me think um"
4416240,4426160," maybe let's actually not do that right let's actually not do that at least for now"
4426160,4432640," let's analyze uh the whole image right like let's literally analyze the whole image"
4433200,4442000," uh and create uh this thing because uh um we can spend like a lot of time bottling with web api i know"
4442000,4444800," that uh right"
4444800,4454560," imagine porcy a student who can't tell if answer is good or bad well i mean this answer will work right"
4454560,4458880," this answer will work but i mean it's just like it's painful so that just means that"
4459680,4465760," the web doesn't really have a proper way of doing that uh right it doesn't really have a proper way of"
4465760,4466240," doing that"
4466240,4477520," so let me let me think let me think so we're gonna just basically try to create a stable"
4477520,4484160," um a stable seller automaton out of those things right so that's how we're going to be approaching this"
4484160,4488320," entire stuff all right so okay um"
4488320,4498960," how we're going to do this entire stuff so here are unique pixels right so this is the unique pixels"
4498960,4505120," and maybe uh let's call them like maybe colors right so i already did something like colors below"
4505120,4510400," uh-huh yeah there we go so we don't really need this kind of stuff anymore"
4510400,4522000," i really need it um i need to have i need to create my own automaton uh my keyboard has died yet again"
4522000,4534480," what the fuck dude dude no no chat chat kgb hacked me kgb hacked into my computer and now i cannot use my"
4534480,4540400," keyboard what the fuck i don't know why by the way sometimes it just like dies oh yeah there we go so"
4540400,4547520," we uh ref uh we deflected the kgb attack so i gained control on my laptop back"
4547520,4551440," uh that's because i said minus honey social creates yeah"
4551440,4558320," that's probably why um okay so i need to create a new automaton right so this is going to be const"
4558800,4566960," uh stable uh stable uh let's just call this table uh automaton right and it's an array of states right"
4566960,4576960," and as far as i know you are supposed to actually create uh colors len right and we're going to fill"
4576960,4583440," this entire thing with uh just like empty objects and whatnot right so we're filling it with the empty"
4583440,4594480," objects uh though it's not particularly great to do it like that if you know what i mean uh right so"
4594480,4600240," maybe we have to map it all right so i'm gonna take uh each individual thing in here maybe i don't even"
4600240,4606800," care what kind of things i get uh getting here uh all right and what i need to return i actually need to"
4606800,4617040," return a state and a state is these things right so state is this thing interface state so color"
4617040,4632320," that means by the way that we can just take the colors and map them yo yo yo yo all right that's"
4632320,4636960," actually actually very cool so the color is basically the color and here is the default so"
4636960,4643600," this is basically the default transition if we can't find any transitions in this table so the question"
4643600,4655520," is how what could it be maybe we can say okay stay in your own uh transition uh right maybe say or maybe we"
4655520,4661760," we can just basically short circuit it to zero right so to the first one uh and in terms of transitions"
4661760,4666560," right now all of the transitions are empty right so we don't really have anything in here uh there we"
4666560,4672640," go so we basically created sort of like um initial initial thing in here right does it make sense"
4672640,4682400," okay that's pretty cool and that's pretty progress i would even say uh we can uh even print"
4682400,4688240," the cellular automaton that we just constructed uh right we just constructed so let's actually refresh"
4688240,4694400," this entire stuff and there you go we have 11 states and for each state we have a color default to zero"
4694400,4699840," and so on and so forth and it's actually very convenient that the uh the default one is actually the one"
4699840,4705680," with zero zero zero zero zero zero um so what this table means in the context of javascript"
4705680,4714080," automation stable the context is not javascript automation it's a uh javascript automaton right"
4714080,4720240," we are making several automaton uh so the stable one is the one that just preserves the picture"
4720240,4727280," right so we're gonna put this picture onto the board and we're gonna create a seller automaton that"
4727280,4732400," given that picture will just keep it steady keep it stable that's the idea"
4733920,4739200," uh right because that's the most obvious easiest thing to implement because essentially what you do"
4739200,4746320," you iterate through each individual pixel of uh the picture you look around look at the account of the"
4746320,4752800," neighbors and you use that to basically stay in that specific state so it just naturally gives you the"
4752800,4757440," rules the transitions between the uh between different states and stuff like that"
4759920,4768000," does it make sense make sense um right it's all related to all of the previous streams that we did"
4768000,4775680," on the topic so right so this is the problem with making multi-episodes projects is right is that um"
4775680,4781920," all of the stuff is already explained but before you need to watch previous episodes where we like"
4781920,4788160," dedicated the whole episode describing all of that stuff right so and i've already talked about it and i've"
4788160,4793200," already talked about it and already explained a lot of these things but since this is a stream not"
4793200,4798960," everyone watches the episodes i have to keep repeating things over and over and over again right so um"
4798960,4810160," oh boy i forgot what i was doing so i need to start iterating 30 pixels of the of the original image"
4810160,4818720," so the problem here is that i need a mapping i need a mapping from a color to a state right so it's rather"
4818720,4826320," easy to create such mapping i think uh right it's rather easy to create such mapping if we just simply"
4826320,4833840," iterate all of the colors like so right colors length right so this is a course length plus plus i"
4834880,4845440," and we had the um color to state mapping right so this is a color to state and in here we it's just a"
4845440,4853040," reverse mapping you know uh right so we just do colors uh it's i and we just do it back so maybe there"
4853040,4860080," is a way to find uh all of this thing but i'm not 100 sure so this thing i'm pretty sure has to be something"
4860080,4867840," like this so we're gonna map the string to a number mapping the string to a number and that's basically"
4867840,4875520," what it is and so then we can use when we're analyzing the the pixels right when we're analyzing"
4875520,4885200," the pixels we can try to do all of that uh so we got the subs from from frontisic 1917 thank you so much"
4885200,4891760," for t1 subscription with the message omg wow it's already my 10th month anniversary anniversary i"
4891760,4897680," thought i just had my nine month uh thanks so much those things i started my first c project inspired by"
4897680,4905040," you doing a little theorem pro for uh fall i i don't know what is the fall uh i i really miss algebraic data"
4905040,4911600," types but we're gonna make it okay i'm really glad that you enjoyed my my streams and good luck with your"
4911600,4922080," project um thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you all right so uh we"
4922080,4928320," have a reverse mapping right so we have a reverse mapping so that basically means it should be relatively"
4928320,4934320," easy for me to now start analyzing things around so the problem with analyzing things around is here is"
4934320,4945200," that we uh essentially uh have pixels right we essentially have pixels um"
4945200,4955040," and that means we have to start iterating this thing again but slightly differently right so okay"
4955600,4959440," that's not particularly convenient but we can try that right so this is going to be y"
4959440,4966880," uh right and then cute uh height right so this is going to be there and then we're gonna so we are"
4966880,4974560," iterating by uh by rows first uh and then we're going to be iterating by columns and what i need to be able"
4974560,4983440," to do right what i need to be able to do is that i need to be able to oh man"
4983440,4993440," i need to be able to get this kind of stuff but this is not particularly convenient that's the problem"
4993440,4999760," right so i don't want to work on the level of pixels anymore which means that i probably"
5000720,5007040," want to have a function right i probably want to have a function that just converts all of the like"
5007040,5014080," just pre-processes all of that stuff right so i'm going to give it an image it is going to uh count its"
5014080,5021520," states right and give you the board of this this is actually very cool i think i think this is actually"
5021520,5032560," very cool right basically image image to sort of like um process image right process image so in here"
5032560,5038560," as an image we're going to take maybe image data right so this is image data and here we're going to"
5038560,5047920," return all right we can actually return a pair so we can return a board that contains uh that is the size of the image"
5047920,5055920," right the board of the size of the image uh but instead of colors it is going to have um the numbers that"
5055920,5064240," represents each individual state and we're also going to get an initial automaton that contains uh you know"
5064240,5070000," the colors and empty transition tables and stuff like that so i don't think it works that way right"
5070000,5075600," so it complains about this kind of thing what does it say uh function uh whose declaration type is neither"
5075600,5082800," uh must ah it's just like it it wants to return the value okay sure geez all right can you just return"
5082800,5088320," no it probably cannot return no right because it's it both of these things are not doable uh right"
5088320,5093680," but i don't think i care about it too much anyway uh all right and essentially"
5094640,5099120," i need to come up with the name of this thing uh right so process image"
5099120,5106000," image um i don't know it's it's like sort of like an initial step"
5106000,5113040," in uh processing that specific image um but i don't know how to how to name this entire thing"
5114560,5118240," maybe like normalize normalize image"
5118240,5131520," automaton that's that's the way we want to work uh about all of that so okay uh the problem here is"
5131520,5138720," that board uh actually kind of has a fixed size right if you know what i mean it kind of has a fixed size"
5139760,5146320," and uh we had coded it so what i'm thinking is that maybe board has to be some sort of an interface"
5146320,5157440," right uh which also has a width and height right and maybe as cells it is going to have an array of"
5157440,5164320," cells yeah so it's kind of similar to like it's going to be flat yeah let's just actually keep it flat"
5164320,5169840," i think that's a pretty good idea right because then it will make it easier to construct the center"
5169840,5177360," i think right it will make it easier to construct the center stuff so um yeah so this is the board"
5177360,5183520," uh and let's just keep it like that so when we're creating a board right when we're creating a board"
5183520,5188160," we probably want to accept the width and height right so this is going to be width and height"
5188960,5200320," uh and here we're creating this entire stuff um so let's say that width is going to be the width"
5200320,5206640," right so the width is going to be the width and height is going to be the height and the cells uh"
5206640,5214480," well it's going to be probably array width by height right but field with zero all right and we're going"
5214480,5223200," to return this entire thing um so interestingly we'll have to go through a lot of these things"
5223200,5226960," and uh basically factor it out"
5226960,5235920," basically like refactor all these things right because the the board has changed it's um um you"
5235920,5241840," know the way you work with all that right i wonder if i can have some methods in here right that can help"
5241840,5248800," you so do you have to make it a class uh right because it would be nice to have some sort of like"
5248800,5258000," a get uh where you would have x number y number right but i'm pretty sure this is not how it works"
5258000,5268720," right so we we have to make it a class uh right and then here we would do this um this cells x multiplied"
5268720,5277440," actually know y multiplied by this height plus x right so and i want this thing to return the cell"
5277440,5281680," so i don't think this is how it works so we'll have to work with all of that manually"
5281680,5286160," okay anyway so let me try to recompile this entire thing and go to the compilation errors"
5293600,5303440," all right so uh here we are counting the neighbors right so the board uh that means we have to do cells"
5303440,5312880," row multiplied so the current row multiplied by the board board width plus c and that will kind of work"
5312880,5318720," all right but again it's not particularly convenient uh can i just have a method in an interface without a"
5318720,5325040," class i actually don't think so right i actually don't think so so we probably have to turn it into"
5325040,5335280," a class right um so this one can we just make them public all right so it complains about things uh in"
5335280,5340320," here width has not initialized and is not okay so we just need to do something like constructor"
5341200,5345920," right right so this is going to be width which is going to be a number uh then it's going to be height"
5345920,5351920," which is going to be another number uh all right and the way we're going to work with that is we're"
5351920,5364480," going to initialize all this um height and sell i can just steal this code from here all right so i'm going"
5364480,5380160," going to steal this code from here and that should be it all right so that should be basically it"
5380160,5392240," all right so the way i want to do that now i want to do get which accepts um x"
5394800,5400160," uh but i'm sure should it take first row and then the column uh maybe should x um"
5400160,5411040," and y i think it's going to be better return these cells y multiplied by this width plus x"
5411040,5418320," right so that this will make it a little bit less uh error prone hopefully uh and uh we probably want to"
5418320,5424240," have something like set uh right which sets the the value of the cell doesn't really accept anything"
5424240,5434640," all right so this is going to be cell we can also maybe accept a cell number like so"
5434640,5443360," all right so i think that would make sense as well all right so excuse me let's go to the"
5443360,5452320," compilation errors it can take some time apparently it's very very difficult all right uh get uh but"
5452320,5459360," since first has to be x it's cr all right so we have to be a little bit careful in here um all right"
5460320,5470880," so next uh set uh cr uh i should probably rename them to x and y at some point yeah there we go so next"
5470880,5479200," we set c and r uh to this specific thing to this specific transition uh then get"
5479200,5485360," r like so"
5485360,5492960," this one is interesting so since i have methods maybe i can somehow simplify all of that stuff"
5494480,5501840," maybe not shouldn't shouldn't shouldn't do that uh at least for now at least for now"
5501840,5508560," all right and we're just setting it like that"
5508560,5513120," so uh let me actually rename this kind of stuff so this is going to be why"
5515600,5525680," and here's an interesting thing um since board actually stores its own board rows and board combs"
5525680,5533440," i don't think i need i don't think i need to pass this kind of stuff right i don't think i need to pass"
5533440,5540640," this kind of stuff so the problem with this kind of stuff is that the board the current and next they"
5540640,5547440," can have different uh different sizes right so that's kind of the problem uh maybe what i'm going"
5547440,5555600," to do is i'm going to just like assert that the current width is equal to next width and the same with"
5555600,5560720," height right because that's basically what we're expecting here it would be kind of cool to maybe"
5560720,5568000," have this as run time values right as generics so to speak if you know what i mean right so that way"
5568000,5572960," it will hand a percent match but i'm planning to use board as actually um"
5572960,5583840," so i want to have boards that only have size at runtime right so i also want to be able to do this kind of stuff"
5583840,5590560," um but maybe these two types should should be different"
5590560,5595440," uh i think these two types should be different so the the board"
5596160,5600960," i don't know so i i just need to continue like doing this kind of stuff like and see how it evolves"
5600960,5607600," over time right so this is going to be y uh and the current uh height plus plus y"
5607600,5617440," so x uh current width plus plus x there we go so we get that uh count neighbors this one can be xy"
5618400,5624640," xy so that already like be way more readable than cr as you can see right it's way more readable"
5624640,5632080," xy and makes way more sense i really like how it goes and uh we're done with this entire thing okay"
5633440,5650080," so we have another thing in here so we have a rendering uh so i think i need to remove this kind"
5650080,5657200," of thing i think i think i need to uh right to sort of encourage the compiler to tell me that i"
5657200,5664800," shouldn't use this thing anymore uh right so this one is width and no no no no no no this is actually y"
5665440,5669120," all right so yeah so this is going to be y"
5669120,5680560," uh board height so this is x x board width x"
5680560,5684480," okay so we have a little bit of a problem in here"
5685840,5686080," um"
5686080,5696560," so what is this so i suppose this is a rectangle related so i'm going to perfect prefix it with r"
5696560,5701920," to indicate that it's a beginning of the rectangle right that's what it is get xy"
5701920,5711840," there we go so automaton i board get xy and we set it in here xy blah blah blah actually it has to be rx"
5712720,5713280," r y"
5713280,5723200," so we've got some sub would you look at that uh thank you so much zaki simo for uh which comes"
5723200,5726720," of which one thank you thank you thank you with a message thank you for poke stream thank you"
5726720,5730400," for a twitch prime subscription i'm really glad that you enjoy the streams"
5730400,5735760," all right so what else do we have in here uh so count neighbors this one is interesting all right"
5736320,5744960," so uh here we accept um actually right so x and y uh right we have to change them to"
5744960,5753440," oh boy this is dangerous right so i'm effectively changing the order of these things so it can fire"
5753440,5760960," back kind of badly at some point so i'm not sure so i have to be super careful though"
5760960,5767280," i don't think in this specific case the order matters all right i don't think the order matters"
5768960,5780480," right all right all right all right all right so board height because if i make a mistake anywhere in"
5780480,5787120," here it's gonna bite me in the ass so badly um all right so then we have get xy"
5787360,5797600," uh-huh there we go seems more or less good but this needs to be done right so i need to abstract away"
5797600,5803760," the the board stuff uh the board stuff"
5803760,5817280," okay so when we're rendering this entire thing uh right so this is a calls that means board"
5817360,5826480," width uh width uh width and this one board height okay so then i'm iterating this kind of stuff"
5826480,5835040," all right that's cool so what are the rest of the is that it i can't believe that is it actually"
5835040,5846640," um all right so here we have a normalized image right i'm gonna actually turn it off right now because i"
5846640,5851360," want this entire thing to compile right i want this entire thing to compile because we need to test"
5851360,5852480," how all that works"
5852480,5858640," so all right so create a board"
5858640,5865600," so initially we had the board size and let's actually say it's 64."
5865600,5869440," so for this kind of stuff i just do board size board size"
5870160,5873840," but then uh but then uh at some point it's going to be more flexible"
5873840,5880400," uh oh okay so let me say it should be able to do new board right because it created a class out of it"
5880400,5885440," so board columns when we are"
5886960,5892640," uh okay so this has to be current uh board"
5892640,5898400," width current uh board"
5898400,5904640," height all right so that looks a goodie"
5904640,5912080," uh a row and column row and column so this is x this is y"
5916240,5919760," get xy i has to be set actually"
5919760,5923200," yo"
5923200,5936080," so i remember you changed r0 to yeah okay account neighbors thank you so much because i have to"
5936080,5944960," actually go to call neighbors to where we call them uh though in here but thank you for for telling me"
5944960,5951520," anyway right so because i changed the order in here and i changed the order in here but then here yeah"
5951520,5954400," so everything's fine but thank you for for telling me right because it's one of the"
5954400,5959680," places where i could have blown up uh i suppose right it could have blown up"
5959680,5964880," um but i think it's not a problem specifically in here"
5964880,5968080," right i think it's not a problem specifically here"
5968720,5974720," uh all right so let me refresh this entire stuff i still have a slow network right i still have a slow"
5974720,5984080," network uh let me take a look 64 32 let's refresh so because i want a bigger stuff in here and uh okay"
5984080,5987680," so i'm using uh the brian's brain"
5987680,5996480," seems to be working fine more or less uh so one of the things we can do we can actually divide the uh"
5996480,6002880," height by two all right so that way it oh yeah it actually makes like things"
6004640,6013440," you know it would be kind of cool if the uh canvas also preserved the ratio right it would be kind of"
6013440,6016320," cool if it preserved the ratio um"
6020400,6026320," so but i'm i don't think i want no we'll need to do that because at some point i want to take this"
6026320,6033120," and turn it into like canvas render it as a canvas and it's not a square so that means we need to be"
6033120,6039600," able to to just do that right so we need to figure out the uh the ratio right so we need to figure out"
6039600,6047120," the ratio so here what we do we set the width and height of the canvas so probably this is not where"
6047120,6054400," we have to set it though we can say that width has to be this right so we can say that width has to be this"
6054400,6062080," uh all right so here we have a current uh board so since next and current board has to be the same size"
6062080,6068000," i can actually do a little bit of a trick in here uh all right so board width and current"
6068000,6074640," board height so basically they're always the same uh okay so we can say"
6076000,6086800," that width um actually height of the current board related to its width"
6086800,6094560," and this is the ratio that we have to apply to the width of this thing"
6094560,6105200," and apply it back to the height to restore the same sort of ratio if you know what i'm talking about"
6106000,6114320," right so the ratio between height and width is this and we apply the same ratio to width to get the height"
6114320,6121600," does that make sense and that way we will create the same ratio in here as you can see"
6123520,6129920," and it's always square so and uh so in here we can even maybe multiply it by two"
6129920,6134160," uh all right so here we sort of lock"
6134160,6144160," um width to be eight pixel 800 pixels all right but then and then we uh compute height relative to that"
6144160,6151040," according to the ratio in the current board so something like that all right and it kind of works i really like that"
6151680,6158560," uh and let me try to just run uh well i mean we can try to run this thing but i want you to actually"
6158560,6166080," run game of life uh all right and i wanted to just like see how glider is going to"
6166080,6170240," basically react to this entire stuff the glider seems to be working"
6170240,6175680," this is actually way better because now i can use arbitrary stuff"
6177680,6182080," nothing is broken surprisingly right so if it compiles it works am i right"
6182080,6188800," fellow recreational programmers pokers yes yes yes kawaii freaking desu"
6188800,6190880," yo yo"
6190880,6198400," okay so what we were doing essentially what i want to be able to do right i want to be able to give the image"
6198400,6204640," data and get the board that they that they can then set as the for instance current board"
6204640,6205840," um"
6205840,6211760," all right so let me let me just go ahead and copy paste all that stuff"
6211760,6220560," uh in here right maybe one of the things first we have to do we have to uh create a board new board is"
6220560,6229600," going to be essentially uh image width and image height right so that's the new board that will have to return"
6229600,6239760," eventually uh and then uh okay uh so how we're going to be iterating all that we're going to be iterating by y's"
6239760,6251600," all right so uh this is going to be height and y plus plus y all right and then this is going to be x x"
6251600,6253760," width x"
6253760,6261280," all right so now let's take the data so here x and y so i need to do y"
6261280,6268160," multiply it by the size of the row but also multiply it by four because the size of the row is not width"
6268160,6272480," it's width multiplied by four because we have additional stuff in here i have to replace cute"
6272480,6283600," with the image actually there we go so plus um x multiplied by four i think yeah that's true"
6283600,6293520," so maybe we can then basically move this stuff here right yeah that makes sense okay and then we construct"
6293520,6307040," this thing in here and there we go so we don't really need the board right now but we may need it in the"
6307040,6319200," future so essentially when i do unique pixel i map a color and a number basically how many times it was"
6319200,6324560," encountered but it's not a useful information i don't really care how many times it was encountered"
6324560,6331840," i really don't care what i probably should store there is the number is the current state but that also"
6331840,6340400," means that i need to have a counter starting at zero right so if this caller is equal to undefined"
6340400,6345360," i have to set it to count plus plan plus plus plus so i basically increment the the state"
6345360,6357040," uh and then uh right what i have to do i have to actually do board set x and y to that specific"
6357040,6364080," thing in here so which kind of means that maybe unique pixels should be called something different"
6365200,6370400," um i think i know how to call it color to state that's what it is yeah this is the color to state"
6370400,6376880," i would i want you to compute initially yo the code right itself um"
6376880,6387200," that's actually pretty progress all right so and uh we've got the board so i can return the board"
6387200,6396880," but also i need to create an automaton right so that means i need to do object keys uh maybe okay so i'm"
6396880,6407520," gonna do something like uh automaton all right automaton is going to be equal so this is a const"
6408320,6422560," object key is color to state and map this entire sheet so color uh huh and we need to return this state so"
6422560,6428800," this state uh in interface"
6432640,6437840," i think we're going somewhere hopefully not to a prison"
6437840,6446320," uh okay color default let's reset it to zero and the transition table is going to be actually empty"
6446320,6458400," and that's it we implemented the normalized image so normalized image literally takes the pixels of the"
6458400,6464800," image and returns you a board with the state of the unique like with the pixels replaced with their"
6464800,6470480," corresponding states and an automaton like empty automaton uh with also the same states right it's"
6470480,6476160," just sort of like prepares the image so to speak i don't know like how would you call something like"
6476160,6482240," that how would you call such step of processing the image like i cannot come up with like a good name for"
6482240,6490480," such step uh right so there should be some sort of a fancy name for this kind of thing uh right so and"
6490480,6496960," that allows us to do the following thing uh image to board but it also converts to automaton synthesize"
6496960,6503840," that's a very good thing um no no image to board doesn't really work because we also have automaton"
6503840,6509680," right so because you can strike them simultaneously uh right you can strike them simultaneously and this is very"
6509680,6518800," important um so i like synthesize because it's a fancy word it uh makes it sound like you're doing"
6518800,6525760," something serious it's like dynamic programming right it has nothing to do with being dynamic nor programming"
6525760,6533600," well almost uh but it sounds cool right so it sounds cool so this kind of step because it's so"
6533600,6541040," meaningless it's so meaningless it needs to have a fancy name like a synthesized instantiation"
6541040,6551040," of cellular automaton so maybe we can take two fancy words uh synthesize and instantiate"
6552560,6567680," and code synthence synthence uh transcendental adhesion of image that's a good one uh all right"
6575360,6590560," holy okay that's what it is now thank you so much i really like it uh transcendental um"
6590560,6604400," yeah we provide this thing and really thank you uh that give us the cute board and cute uh autom automaton"
6605360,6615440," and this is job security one oh one that's right job security one oh one uh okay so here is the"
6615440,6626480," interesting thing uh if i set um essentially the cute board as the uh as the current board what is going to"
6626480,6634880," going to happen right um transcendental adhesion of image i love it"
6634880,6647760," okay and it blew up uh can i read property color of undefined how did it compile god damn it typescript my ass"
6647760,6659920," yes as usual um so all right so what you didn't like 37 um so it didn't have a color surprisingly all right"
6659920,6667200," didn't i provide this kind of thing here okay so i think we need to print them i think we need to print"
6667200,6681520," them so i'm going to do console uh cute board uh automaton right let's refresh so board with 64"
6681520,6688800," uh and cells right so and this is how many of these things we have and we have like value zero one that"
6688800,6697120," makes sense that makes a lot of sense actually um oh i see so you also have to set the automaton"
6698080,6705440," to the cute oh i they're connected i completely forgot that boards and automaton are connected"
6705440,6710720," they are in fact connected and since they are connected maybe they have to be the same thing"
6710720,6714240," maybe i don't know uh cute automaton"
6714240,6727040," so we don't really need a board size anymore button uh that's fine and it didn't work surprisingly yeah"
6728000,6734400," it literally did not work it didn't render anything um i wonder why"
6734400,6740240," so what if i set next huh"
6742160,6746000," it's not supposed to really uh it's not supposed to really render anything"
6746000,6747600," uh"
6747600,6750080," it's a network keyboard"
6750080,6754720," so let's see"
6754720,6758080," slow network"
6758080,6760880," you are slow"
6760880,6763120," so"
6763120,6763680," ah"
6763680,6765600," of course"
6766080,6769280," do you guys do you guys see the problem you can see the problem"
6769280,6777680," this is not a style this is not a color"
6777680,6781440," the color has a hash sign in front of it"
6781440,6787360," who would have thought that the problem is that dumb like i swear to god anyway"
6787360,6788160," so"
6788160,6792720," oh"
6792720,6796960," uh and there we go so the these are literally these states"
6796960,6802000," right these are literally the states and i can remove some of them right so as you can see i can"
6802880,6804320," start removing these things"
6804320,6805920," all right so"
6805920,6812000," and when i do the next step of the cell automaton all of them are disappearing"
6812000,6815120," right so the next step of the cell automaton all of them are disappearing"
6816400,6818160," uh that's pretty cool right"
6818160,6825120," so uh we literally transformed the image into cellular automaton this is so cool actually"
6825120,6834720," what the um one of the things like it would be kind of cool to just run"
6834720,6838960," game of life on them right just run game of live of them but"
6838960,6843920," i mean this thing has more states than game of life so it's not going to work that easily"
6844640,6849520," i think right and we can't really easily merge"
6849520,6857680," automatos or can we that's a very interesting question can we merge automatos"
6857680,6869280," um so essentially what if i had a function merge a time or maybe add automaton right so here we're"
6869280,6876160," going to have the destination the receiver uh automaton automaton and here we're going to have a source"
6876160,6884960," so the idea is going to be iterating through the source and taking its transition tables and merging them"
6884960,6888800," into the uh transition tables of the corresponding states to the destination"
6888800,6892960," uh right so that's the idea"
6892960,6900800," uh and let's go ahead and try to do that so here i'm going to be iterating uh this kind of thing"
6900800,6905040," zero less src length plus plus i"
6906000,6912640," uh right and in here for uh so this is a state right so that means i want to do a state"
6912640,6922080," so one of the things i assume in here by the way that uh console log src the amount of states in source"
6922080,6929200," is less or equal than destination right it's quite important because if it has more that means the"
6929200,6934400," destination just will have the states it doesn't yeah so that means the source has a state that"
6934400,6940240," destination doesn't have right you we can handle that but i'm just too lazy to do that uh right"
6940240,6949840," so i'm just too lazy to do that and in here right so if i do a transition right um it's going to be t less than"
6950480,6960480," src as transitions all right src as transitions but the problem here is that we also somehow need"
6960480,6964800," to merge the default all right so we need to somehow merge the default"
6964800,6970000," oh yeah console asserts yeah"
6970000,6979760," all right uh so this one it's not particularly important to do this thing that's the problem"
6979760,6982400," it's not particularly important to do this thing but i kind of want to do that"
6982400,6996720," so i already strained for two hours god damn it so that means we probably want to make a small break"
6996720,7002240," right the reason why i'm doing all of that is because i want to try to run one of the existing"
7002240,7009520," cell automatons on this specific thing just to see how it's gonna go uh right but i"
7009520,7014400," think i need to make a small break because i'm a little bit tired right so and i need to make a cup"
7014400,7025440," of tea so let's make some break um i think this is a dumb idea you know why because uh if seller"
7025440,7033040," automatons have different states their keys in transition tables are also going to be different"
7033040,7040800," right so the size of the key in the transition table uh has to be equal to the amount of states and if the"
7040800,7048080," states are different the keys become incompatible and so each key essentially contains the amount of"
7048080,7057520," neighboring cells over that specific state so basically here you have to have four cells with the state zero two"
7057520,7063840," state two cells with the state one and two cells with the state two that's basically what this key means"
7063840,7072640," right so and you may say you may think why i'm using uh you know strings in here what if a particular"
7072640,7079280," amount of states is going to be more than 10. well the whole amount of neighbors cannot be bigger than eight"
7080000,7086400," so none of these values are ever going to be bigger than 10 or even equal to 10. they are never going to"
7086400,7094480," be bigger than eight in fact so that's how it works essentially uh that's how it works so because of that"
7094480,7100080," this is a very dumb idea so i probably should not attempt that so uh we're not gonna do that so i was"
7100080,7105680," just thinking what if i just take uh this thing and try to apply one of the existing seller automatons"
7105680,7112880," what's gonna happen but maybe i shouldn't do that anyways so let's actually try to build a stable uh"
7112880,7118320," transition table so to speak right let's give it a try and see how it's gonna go so to do that we need"
7118320,7124400," to iterate through each individual pixel of the cube board finally i can easily do that finally i have"
7124400,7130000," all the data structures that make sense and i don't have to work directly with pixels but if we will do"
7130000,7136800," that i need to acknowledge yet another sub yet another person throwing money at me like crazy mask of"
7136800,7141760," winters thank you so much for twitch prime subscription with the message been learning a lot from your stream"
7141760,7149920," sir your giga chat of programming no i'm really not right i'm just saying bullshit with a confident voice"
7149920,7156080," and uh just writing you know bullshit projects right that's what i do but i do that for recreational"
7156080,7162800," purposes so my goal is to have fun in here right but i'm glad that it still inspires other people to"
7162800,7165200," actually uh to actually do their own things"
7168000,7174560," nice accent though thank you i actually practiced for a very long time to have this beautiful beautiful"
7174560,7180480," slavic accent i was so dedicated to having this accent that i moved to russia"
7180480,7186960," so dedicated i was born in russia just to have this beautiful accent thank you very much"
7186960,7193920," all right so let's iterate through the pixels"
7196640,7206560," uh cute board i am height uh plus plus y uh then we're going to be iterating the columns uh cute"
7206560,7215680," board width do i sound like a villain do i sound like a villain um all right"
7215680,7226400," i would swear it's a french accent yeah sure um okay so what we can do in here right so"
7226400,7232720," we now want to count the neighbors right how do you count the neighbors count the neighbors uh so"
7232720,7239360," to count the neighbors you need to have an array uh of the size of the amount of uh states right"
7239360,7245440," so we need this neighbors array right so that's what you need to have here so we can just take a cute"
7245440,7248960," uh automaton right so cute automaton and we're going to fill it with the length"
7251120,7258320," cute neighbors count neighbors and let's see uh all right so we're going to provide the cute"
7258320,7262080," boards we're going to provide the neighbors and we're going to provide x and y"
7262080,7266400," uh we're going to provide x and y"
7266400,7274800," already and there we go so and the neighbors now is going to contain the amount of neighbors of different"
7274800,7285840," states so the way we convert uh this thing into the key the transition thing is like this right so we"
7285840,7292720," basically join this entire thing with uh empty string right we can even try to maybe uh print all of these"
7292720,7298080," things in the console just to see how they look like uh right so we're looking at the neighbors it's"
7298080,7305840," probably gonna take yeah that's that's fine right here they are um that's all of the it's all of them"
7305840,7315280," actually not that many it's probably not all of them right some of them were suppressed because it's too"
7315280,7324960," much data um though it's supposed to be like three thousand so i didn't really see three sounds here"
7325760,7335360," so i think it didn't print all of them right um okay so and uh what i want to do"
7335360,7340800," so essentially we can say"
7340800,7351200," uh cute board get x and y so this is the current state right so this is the current state that we have"
7352080,7359600," so in the transition in acute automaton right in that specific state right we take the transition"
7359600,7361680," transition"
7361680,7364960," to here"
7364960,7376960," and we can say that while being in that specific state and having these neighbors just stay in that state"
7377920,7386720," right so as i already said we're constructing this stable uh cell or automaton right so we just go through"
7386720,7392640," all of these things and if you see um if you are in this specific state and you see these specific"
7392640,7401200," neighbors uh just stay in that state so interestingly we may have a situation right we may have situation that"
7401200,7408800," when when this thing is already is already is already defined right so maybe we need to try to handle that somehow"
7408800,7411440," uh right so let me actually uh create transition"
7413440,7420000," uh to do to let's call it neighbors key right neighbors key"
7420000,7423600," who's neighbors key"
7423600,7425600," uh neighbors key"
7429360,7440080," so we want to check if this thing is equal to undefined"
7440080,7453280," if it's equal to undefined we can safely just set this to the state if it is defined if it is defined"
7454160,7456160," we probably want to double check"
7456160,7463360," there should be two situations when they are equal and when they are not equal right when they're equal"
7463360,7469360," we don't care but what if they are not equal right what if they are not equal which one do we pick"
7469360,7477600," and this one is already interesting which one do we pick"
7479120,7482320," what if we literally make it a new transition"
7482320,7484560," hmm"
7484560,7488800," that's a very interesting"
7488800,7491840," uh-huh"
7491840,7504320," so what that means we are in that specific state uh right and we don't stay it in there so we found another thing"
7506000,7510640," we can make it a new transition we can literally make it a new transition"
7510640,7517680," so me to actually make it a new transition we can remove this branch so that means this thing is not"
7517680,7524000," guaranteed to be stable though hey toadyn hope you're doing well i heard the doomer wants to"
7524000,7527200," change some conscription laws they've been doing that for a year already"
7527200,7534160," i don't give a i'm gonna barricade myself with furniture they're not gonna get me"
7534880,7546160," fuck him i can sustain myself on oatmeal for half of a year so i'm going anywhere um all right"
7546160,7555840," so that should so that means it's probably not gonna stay uh but let's see let's see what what"
7555840,7563120," it's gonna how it's gonna behave right so uh we constructed the uh automaton let's see uh how it looks"
7563120,7568400," like right so i just want to print it and see what kind of transitions we have in there right um"
7568400,7575520," are you still considered unfit under the new rules like nobody follows the rules"
7575520,7580960," right so that's that's the thing about this country like there are some rules but nobody"
7580960,7583840," fucking follows it if they need like a lot of meat they're gonna get it"
7583840,7586080," and they don't give a about fitness and fitness"
7586080,7597040," okay so let's take a look uh did they even compile uh sadgi it is a sadgi it's a tiny bit a sadgi"
7597040,7603120," but it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't is it not i think it is the missile knows where it is"
7603120,7604240," because it knows where it is"
7604240,7619120," so we're just waiting for the typescript compiler uh all right let's see"
7621760,7630160," why nothing changed are we cached or something"
7630160,7632880," web"
7632880,7640560," uh all right let's close this i think it died i think it literally died"
7642080,7644080," okay so we'll get some shite"
7644080,7652480," console there we go now we're freaking talking i don't really know what the is that uh but this is"
7652480,7658320," array all right this one is interesting uh so there's a bunch of transitions in here here they are"
7658320,7665680," here are the transitions look at that all right so here are the transitions so do we have any other"
7665680,7672160," transitions in here yeah this is the transition table we've got the transition table for those things"
7672160,7679600," do we have situations when they're not i think one of the things we have to do all right"
7679600,7684960," um you know what i want to do"
7689760,7694320," if this thing is already equal to itself"
7694320,7706080," not equal to undefined"
7706080,7713840," yeah"
7718640,7727520," so if it's already so that means um"
7727520,7738080," we need to do"
7748080,7748640," i think"
7748640,7757440," for some reason my brain stops working so i can't really comprehend"
7757440,7760960," whether this kind of situation will happen"
7760960,7763360," yeah okay"
7763360,7767440," so there are situations like this"
7767440,7771760," yeah sometimes they may"
7771760,7777840," be like that so if it's undefined we define that but if it's already exist we're gonna"
7777840,7783200," ignore that sure okay so uh let's try this"
7783200,7786240," i did it"
7786240,7791520," does it does it clean everything when i refresh"
7791520,7793680," does it does it clean everything when i refresh"
7798960,7802080," okay so let's see if this console behaves like this console behaves in a really weird way"
7802080,7807200," like i literally need to restart the whole page to"
7807200,7811200," like to get like a new fresh thing it just doesn't refresh"
7811200,7812400," um"
7812400,7816800," that's what i'm talking about that's what i wanted to see"
7816800,7824720," all right so let's try to now get uh the next the next state right i kind of want to"
7825520,7830000," oh no oh no yeah right because we have some transitions how it's going to play out"
7830000,7842160," i can't really see anything doesn't seem to be changing at all right but it's staying"
7844240,7851920," it is actually staying so can we remove some of these things i'm going to start removing things"
7851920,7855840," and just see and they're disappearing actually"
7857520,7862240," okay so that's pretty cool so but they are not disappearing completely right"
7862240,7867840," it's actually so cool right"
7870720,7874560," yeah because they're disintegrating because because of this kind of stuff right"
7874560,7886320," and it works like a flood feel in some sense"
7886320,7893440," if you know what i mean this is so cool we need auto play for this thing we need auto play"
7894720,7900320," but the question is how can we how can we do that right so maybe we need to introduce another lebaton"
7900320,7907520," are they being consumed with guys yeah exactly but it kind of works as i expected right uh it kind"
7907520,7918640," of works as i expected so uh let me let me see so let's go to uh html right so and let's introduce a"
7918640,7932320," button uh right so id play right uh and this is a lebaton and let's go into index ts so where's the"
7932320,7940880," where's the next on load next uh so let's copy paste this thing"
7943520,7946880," i'm gonna quickly replace next uh what is it called play"
7946880,7962560," okay next uh-huh play add event listener play there we go and i suppose what we have to do we have"
7962560,7968960," to set timeout right so we need to set some sort of a timeout uh how can we use that where is the"
7971280,7981920," uh so yeah let's give it a try so this entire thing should have been like a separate function"
7981920,7989760," uh all right so next state all right so this is sort of like a next state uh and what we're doing"
7989760,7996560," here we're just doing this stuff in here and on click all right it doesn't really understand how to take"
7996560,8005040," the context uh null and assignable in a parameter can i just say uh something like this is that what you"
8005040,8016640," want that's probably what it wants so then later uh i can do next state all right uh just like this"
8017920,8028960," all right right and then i set timeout uh next state play uh play period all right so the question is"
8028960,8036080," what is the play period um so it's in milliseconds right so it's milliseconds yeah it is in milliseconds"
8036080,8042880," so let's say it's 500 milliseconds should be fine uh but then it should reschedule this and i think"
8043680,8051280," right right it needs to reschedule so there should be some sort of a function that is um you know"
8051280,8062640," play iteration right it's some sort of a play iteration uh which calls next state but then does uh"
8062640,8072400," like reschedules play iteration one more time uh all right and we want to call play iteration right away"
8074480,8081600," all right so there's no way to stop this entire stuff but that can be implemented later uh all"
8081600,8086960," right so did it compile uh all right so this is the next button stuff like that i keep pressing nothing"
8086960,8093520," happens and i press play so it keeps basically competing the next one so if i now i can just do"
8093520,8105680," something like this and uh okay so it doesn't work so it doesn't play yeah okay it doesn't play i wonder"
8105680,8113840," why i don't um because here it would do next state and set timeout play iteration"
8115360,8120000," um so maybe it's not set timeout i said interval okay"
8120000,8128000," is that what it is okay what's the difference i don't know"
8128000,8134240," all right so uh let's deploy and a boom"
8138240,8149680," all right all right why why why why okay so"
8166320,8171440," it's too fast why is it so fast uh it should be in milliseconds"
8171440,8175600," it is too fast"
8175600,8181600," doesn't refresh even"
8181600,8186480," okay"
8190880,8197760," set interval oh set timeout is once so that means set timeout was okay right set timeout was okay"
8197760,8202880," oh jesus christ i'm gonna close the chat nobody fucking knows"
8202880,8205200," um okay"
8205200,8211840," uh all right so let's google up sub timeout"
8215440,8227360," so what do we have uh that's the timer which executes function uh specified"
8227360,8232160," once time expires right so it just does that once"
8232160,8242240," so that means it should work periodically right that means this entire thing should work periodically"
8243360,8250400," so with this problem so this should work right uh just by having a timeout in here that should work"
8250400,8256080," so i call it once it calls the next state and then schedules the next"
8256080,8257280," so"
8257280,8265280," and keep saturating makes sense to me makes sense to me right so that means it's supposed to work"
8265840,8270480," initially chad is gibberish to me yet again never listen to chad"
8270480,8273440," uh all right"
8273440,8283280," all right but something doesn't really work right so it's supposed to like reiterate but it doesn't do that"
8283280,8286560," um okay so"
8290320,8297440," yeah now it works okay so yeah uh now it works exactly as expected and it even works with precisely"
8297440,8302160," the interval that i expected so let's actually do 250 uh right"
8302160,8306800," um"
8312240,8316560," what is this chat what is this chat is this shirt for chat gpt i was thinking that you're gonna say"
8316560,8322800," what is this chat is this is it in the same room with you right so what's what's the chat you're"
8322800,8331280," constantly talking about right so to be fair streaming with chat feels like a schizophrenia simulator"
8331280,8335040," honestly it's just like it's it's the voices in your head right"
8337520,8344400," uh anyway so let's actually try to play and now this thing works uh i think it should go a little"
8344400,8353840," bit faster right but you essentially yeah you essentially destroy all of these things uh like so"
8353840,8356640," it's pretty cool"
8361280,8370560," the uh like the black the black outlines are actually very stable surprisingly they're extremely stable"
8370560,8378160," that's actually super cool huh very interesting yeah we're gonna refresh it"
8378160,8384640," so the most fragile ones are the ones that don't really have that many combinations"
8387280,8397680," keep disappearing right huh all right it will be kind of cool to also build like um assembling cellular"
8397680,8404480," automaton right the one that sort of like assembles uh the image back right so you would have to"
8404480,8410880," analyze it uh i suppose you would have to analyze it in the order in which you want it to be able to"
8410880,8417040," replicate right so you we can create a cell automaton that actually if you damage it it should"
8417040,8425440," recover itself right it must recover itself right it would be so interesting to explore all that"
8425440,8434560," unfortunately i picked a very dumb technology stack and i wasted so much time work like troubleshooting"
8434560,8439680," problems that have nothing to do with cellular automaton's and what's funny is that that happens every"
8439680,8445600," time i do anything with web it's just like every time i do anything with web it's just like i have to"
8445600,8450000," troubleshoot some that has nothing to do with the problem i'm trying to solve and just like huge waste"
8450000,8456880," of time the whole web is a huge waste of time and imagine that this is like the main platform everyone"
8456880,8465280," develops everything for and how much like human hours we're wasting every single second just by using"
8465280,8474240," this technology it's fucking insane holy so yeah uh i think i'm gonna finish the streaming here so maybe i'm"
8474240,8480560," gonna do another one where like because everything is established in here all right so the the framework is"
8480560,8488240," is working so we're gonna continue like experimenting with this thing but i already made too many episodes of"
8488240,8493200," this series right i have no idea how i'm gonna be marketing them on youtube right"
8493200,8498880," no idea how i'm gonna marketing because none of that is particularly marketable"
8498880,8504960," right so what would i say to youtube people i've been sitting doing some web again for"
8504960,8511120," three hours please watch me here is the funny thumbnail is that what i'm gonna tell nobody's gonna click on that"
8512160,8518960," nobody's give a you've been struggling with web loser show us the"
8518960,8524880," end pro the end product where is the end product nobody gives a about you struggling with this web"
8524880,8528960," shit i have no idea how i'm gonna be marketing that so yeah"
8528960,8542480," uh so yeah so just getting to the point where we could just have an image and turn it into a"
8542480,8547840," cellular automaton some kind of cellular attempt to take took way too much time than i expected"
8547840,8553360," way too much time and the web development is supposed to save you development time"
8553360,8557360," right because look at all of these frameworks i mean i didn't really use any of these things but i'm"
8557360,8558400," not sure if they will help me"
8558400,8562080," uh so"
8562080,8572080," i need more more starbucks coffee in you to do proper web dev yeah"
8572080,8578560," i don't know i still don't understand how people like this they probably never"
8578560,8579920," seen or tried anything else"
8581920,8583520," um okay"
8583520,8590480," all right"
8590480,8596640," that's it for the day thanks everyone who's watching me right now i really appreciate it"
8596640,8600880," have a good one and i see you the next time"
8602080,8609920," the next time see you next time love you you"
