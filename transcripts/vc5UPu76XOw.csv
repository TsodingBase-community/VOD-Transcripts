240,6640," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session"
6640,12560," with a mr azuzin let's make a little announcement and officially start the stream hello hello"
12560,20400," let's do red circle live on twitch and what are we doing today on twitch.a television website"
20400,26720," today we're checking cross-term rust library how about that library review"
26720,30720," uh-huh but you didn't expect that should happen so i'm gonna give the link to where we're doing all"
30720,37440," that https twitch.tv and i'm gonna ping everyone who's interested in being pinged there we go the"
37440,42960," stream has officially started the stream has officially started so in fact today we're going"
42960,49200," to continue working on uh for at which is the simple multi-user chat application that we started"
49200,55520," to develop like three streams ago or something like that and the problem with this chat application is"
55520,62400," that it doesn't have a client it has a server right it has a server but it doesn't have a client so so"
62400,68400," far we were testing it uh over telnet so let me actually demonstrate what i mean uh so i'm gonna do"
68400,79360," tmux and let's go to uh for at right so it doesn't exist oh because i renamed it to hat okay so yeah i"
79360,85680," completely forgot right because you can start the uh rust packages with uh with four right so let me"
85680,89920," actually fetch the latest changes uh so i think i didn't do that right before the stream so let me"
89920,98480," quickly do that hello hello everyone welcome welcome welcome um so we're just fetching some source code"
98480,103520," so and let's merge origin name uh right and we have the latest thing so you're supposed to run it"
104080,111600," so for now we don't have any proper authentication right so it's going to generate a special authentication"
111600,119200," token uh that then we'll have to copy paste into this thing so this is a rust project so be patient"
119200,126240," that means it needs some time to rebuild especially for the first time uh so yeah right there we go so"
126240,130880," we don't have a proper authentication yet so basically what it does it just generates a random number and that"
130880,135760," becomes a token so you can give it to some clients and the clients will connect right so you literally"
135760,143600," use telnet right 127.001 and port 6969 right so it asks you for that specific token that the server"
143600,148320," generated you give it the token and there you go you can chat you can say hello so it doesn't really have"
148320,153520," any particular interface and that's the problem uh right so you can actually connect from a different"
153520,161760," place now right so i'm sure if you how well can you see all that right so uh maybe uh i can even do it"
161760,170800," something like that telnet 27.001 and uh 69.69 right so you also provide the token in here and when you say"
170800,177760," hello in one place uh it will also tell it in here too so as you can see so you can have a test and stuff like"
177760,185280," that so uh simple um you know chat application very simple one so it's basically um you know single"
185280,191120," consumer multiple publishers the kind of thing right so so let's actually close with all the connections"
191120,198240," and uh since we don't really have any particularly useful interface it is very inconvenient to use"
198240,204320," especially when you have a lot of people so what i want to have instead right so i want to have a console"
204320,208560," application at least for now i'm not sure if we're going to go to the GUI but maybe we'll go into the"
208560,213760," GUI at some point i want to have a console application that takes up the entire screen"
213760,221840," right and one line one row the last row is reserved for the user prompt right is reserved for the user"
221840,228240," prompt and it never changes and when uh this kind of client receives new messages it just appends it to"
228240,234160," the list above that prompt without disturbing the prompt or anything like that so we need"
234480,240480," the basic functionality like that so that means we need to have a lot of control over the terminal"
240480,245280," right so we need to have a lot of control over the terminal and uh one of the libraries i heard"
245280,250960," people are talking about in the rust community is called cross term right so there's been a lot of"
250960,256720," different uh terminal libraries throughout the history of rust they pop in and they fade out constantly"
256720,265120," because it's rust uh right so as of right now at this day and age people use cross term i have no"
265120,271440," idea for how long my application is going to survive if it depends on cross term uh but it's just a client"
271440,276960," anyway it's just a client anyway so let's just give it a try let's give it a try and see how well"
277680,284000," it performs it actually solves our problem so for now our problem is very uh is very simple is very"
284000,292560," straightforward and see if it actually will solve it so anyway let's go ahead and do that uh so i already"
292560,302640," actually exited uh the chat in here so um we i plan essentially to have two executables within uh within"
302640,310240," the project right so in cargo uh we can specify one executable i suppose to specify the second one"
310240,316800," what we have to do we have to say uh something like this right so we have a server and we have a client"
316800,321520," but we don't have this file yet we don't have this file yet so let's go ahead and maybe create that file"
321520,330720," so this can be going to rs and uh let's just write a simple hello world so hello uh from clients"
330720,337520," there we go so let us see what is going to happen if we try to build this i never actually worked with a"
337520,345040," project with several executable so i'm not sure how it's going to work uh right so if i do run and i"
345040,351840," have several okay so cargo run could not determine the executable the binary to run uses dash dash bin"
351840,358400," option to specify the binary uh right so available binary is client and server that's actually very cool"
358400,365360," so if i do buying uh being client there we go hello from clients and if i do uh server it will run the"
365360,373360," server so we have two executables within the project pretty cool pretty safe for pretty nice so uh let's"
373360,380800," do the the first thing that we would like to do let's add cross term as a dependency all right not that"
380800,385600," many dependencies so let's try to build the entire thing and see for how long it is going to build how"
385600,389280," how many new crate oh it's not that much actually it's pretty small"
389280,393600," mm-hmm"
393600,395200," parking lot"
395200,398320," it also depends on rink"
398320,405200," oh wait no it's it's not we're depending on rink from russells right so we're using russells we don't"
405200,409600," really do encryption yet but we already depend on russells just in case right because we're going to be using that"
409600,418640," uh small vec small vec that's a very interesting name for a package let's take a look at the tree of the"
418640,428080," dependencies uh that's a pretty small tree no it's not that bad actually it's not that bad especially if"
428080,435600," you take a look at the cross term that's reasonable that's very reasonable so that's pretty cool uh all right"
435600,443280," so let's generate the docs right because we're going to be learning um you know cross term from the docs"
443280,449360," so i was generating documentation so it will generate documentation for all of the dependencies as well"
449360,456480," uh i should have maybe supplied the dash dash open flag so it opens the browser automatically"
456480,462560," as it stops you know generating things but i can do that uh one more time so go open and i suppose it's"
462560,467040," not going to do that at the second time it's not going to rebuild things for the second time so here"
467040,473040," are all of our crates that we depend on and uh here is the cross term so there we go so here is the"
473040,479760," documentation for all of our dependencies and it's local uh cross term is a pure rust that's actually"
479760,484240," pretty cool a terminal manipulation library that makes it possible to write cross-platform text-based"
484240,491360," interfaces see features okay it supports all unix and windows terminals down to windows 7 not all"
491360,496000," terminals are tested see test the terminals for more info i don't really care uh this crate supports all"
496000,507520," unix and windows terminals down to okay i got it okay okay it supports all unix and windows terminals down to"
507520,515680," windows 7 you don't have to tell me that twice sure uh okay let's take a look at this thing so the uh the"
515680,521840," features right so this is basically the features that you have uh oh okay it was an anchor right it was"
521840,528160," apparently an anchor so i supposed to just click it and it refers to the section features that doesn't exist"
529040,535440," right so it refers to features"
535440,538880," it doesn't exist"
538880,550480," nice library i mean nice documentation maybe library is good i don't know so command api so the command api"
550480,557440," makes the use of the cross term uh which um much easier and offers more control over when and how command"
557440,564240," is executed uh the command is just an action you can perform on the terminal for example cursor movement"
564240,571360," uh okay blah blah blah cursor so lazy execution we have examples would you look at that we have some"
571360,577520," examples simple demonstration that shows the command api in action with the cursor command so we import"
577520,587280," the usual standard stuff then we import queueable command and cursor okay so and i suppose"
587280,592880," those cubel command is maybe implementation of some sort of interface for the std out right because"
592880,597600," now it extends std out with this kind of thing right because std out by itself as far as"
597600,604400," now it doesn't have this kind of thing uh right so and you queue um essentially the command so"
604400,608400," they improved the performance by batching the commands"
608400,613600," i see what they do so they have a batcher it's a batch renderer for terminal"
615200,620800," do you guys know what is a batch renderer like in in graphics and stuff like that quite often people"
620800,628800," implement that for game engines like with opengl uh right so because in opengl each individual draw"
628800,635680," call could be slow so because of that they what they essentially do they create sort of like"
635680,642560," actions that your renderer can do and they do not perform these actions right away they accumulate those"
642560,650880," actions uh into one bigger action uh called batch and then they render the result once like all at once"
650880,659520," right so and uh yeah that's basically it but for the terminals right uh for the terminals that's kind of"
659520,666080," know and that's why it's cute i suppose right so they reinvented the already existing concept but since"
666080,672240," they didn't know that concept existed they came up with its own name right so uh right they could have"
672240,677840," actually called it batch renderer right so but it's it's q command maybe not i don't know maybe they know"
677840,685440," about batch render so uh okay so and here we can move the uh the cursor and stuff like that so the most"
685440,694240," most interesting interface i suppose for us is qable command right so it is a qable command a q u u u u u u bill"
694240,698720," uh how do you say that you have to add the a"
698720,705840," can your french do that can"
708960,714960," is this really english i'm not sure i think q is also french word isn't it so i'm pretty sure"
714960,722880," it's a french word uh it must be a french word um so and what do we have in here so who implements"
722880,729200," this kind of things uh anything that is writable will implement this thing and it just has one method"
730000,733680," okay so what they did they just extended the writable interface"
733680,741440," all right good enough so what kind of commands can we have in here uh so cross term command it's"
741440,748240," oh it's a trade but who implements this kind of trade okay so here are all of the implementers"
748240,754400," of this trade of the command trade so and uh so what they usually are i suppose they're usually"
754400,761760," structures okay okay okay i see how this entire thing works i can read this entire thing as an open"
761760,770960," book uh it's pretty straightforward right so let's go ahead and try to use that okay so let me see what"
770960,777360," we need in here so we're gonna import these standard things so here are the standard things the write"
777360,784320," interface the stdio that's pretty cool so now we also have this thing so and the cursor apparently"
784320,792880," is sort of like a separate package i didn't realize that by the way so cursor oh some of these commands"
792880,799520," are probably in those separate packages yeah okay move down and stuff like that so how many of such"
799520,806720," commands do we even have uh so the cursor event style so if you take a look at the event uh there's"
806720,811120," so essentially some like key down or mouse mouse events"
814240,823280," not bad not bad not bad okay so i'm intrigued even mouse events and all of that is cross platform"
823280,826320," uh so all of that is cross platform"
826320,834640," okay so uh the first thing we need to do we need to sort of create the std out"
834640,841120," uh right so we're sort of locking it and then we're moving this entire thing we're moving this entire"
841120,846400," thing to five five whatever that's supposed to mean one of the things we can do we can actually print"
846400,853760," hello world and then we can move the cursor to five five and then we can quit and see what is going to"
853760,860800," happen if anything is going to happen at all let's first try to build it uh okay so as we can see uh"
860800,866960," write is not even used right so it's an unused input so we can just do that which is surprising to me"
866960,876880," and on top of that q is a thing that may fail right it may in fact fail so let's maybe uh return a result"
878800,887600," um i don't know so what exactly do we want to return so error is one of these things one of these things"
887600,894720," so usually people return books and i don't want to do that so i'm gonna map error and i'm going to just"
894720,900640," let's actually unwrap it you know what unwrap it so we're just testing things uh we don't need to"
900640,906960," develop like a you know high availability software in here right so we can crash right we can totally"
906960,912720," crash in here so that's totally fine so encuable command is also why do we have to import all of"
912720,919200," these interfaces if we don't ever use them example example what the is wrong with you"
919200,924720," and by the way i i'm an idiot i suppose to actually unwrap this entire thing so and you still need"
924720,927440," okay"
927440,935440," why did you tell me to remove this entire thing if now you require me to add this thing"
935440,941040," what the is wrong with how how is that helpful"
942640,947600," i swear to god the warnings confuse you even more than actually help you"
947600,950400," finally"
950400,960880," excuse me uh all right so let's actually try to do run uh bin client"
960880,963280," and"
967840,976160," is this the cursor is that five zero one two uh three four five okay and"
976160,985120," why did it go here ah i see you know what i'm thinking i'm thinking that it actually was somewhere"
985120,993120," here but once it quitted it forced it to go to the right and that's how it it happened okay so that"
993120,999360," is kind of understandable we can actually confirm that by adding a little bit of a slip right so we"
999360,1008320," can do std thread right so here is the thread and we can sleep for five seconds or so and see where the"
1008320,1013280," cursor is going to be i think five seconds is going to be enough to actually figure that out"
1013280,1015600," that didn't work because we have to provide the duration"
1016640,1027680," so uh can we also do duration um i think rust allows you to do some weird uh goofy ass shit like this"
1027680,1039360," which is equivalent of importing that and that do i understand correctly epic roosters do we have any epic"
1039360,1046560," roosters in the chat uh right so i suppose you can do goofy ass shit like this right so you you can"
1046560,1051600," do it and that basically what it means okay so epic roosters actually confirm that all right so"
1051600,1058400," it doesn't okay oh yeah i forgot to actually use this thing so duration from sex"
1060480,1070080," uh uh and it's a private struct wait a second ah for for a second i thought that it's it's in there so"
1070080,1076720," it's actually in time i'm sorry i apologize for my ignorance of course there we go so let's actually"
1076720,1087520," try to run that and it didn't do all right so to be fair this kind of command is not particularly"
1088080,1093040," representative of what the fuck is going on it is not particularly representative so we want"
1093040,1098080," to do something more interesting so one of the things apparently we can do we can actually clear"
1098080,1106400," everything on the screen right so we can clear everything on the screen so i want to bring back"
1106400,1111680," the place where we had the list of all of the commands okay so that's actually very convenient so here's"
1111680,1119280," the clear and uh we can do clear type clear is within the terminal all right so the end you can clear"
1119280,1129840," so you can do all and you can do purge that's very interesting so all is all cells and purge all plus"
1129840,1138560," history whatever is that supposed to mean like it's not helpful uh right so i suppose the first thing we want"
1138560,1142640," to do if we're going to be like making like an interactive application or something like that"
1142640,1152800," we want to clear all right std out queue uh clear um so terminal um clear"
1152800,1166480," clear type all so and also another interesting thing so can you chain the queues can you chain the queues"
1167120,1171760," so what does key return it just returns the result so you you can't really no it's it's just a command"
1171760,1181120," yeah you oh all right all right all right all right all right you can chain them you can change them"
1181120,1190560," so you didn't flush oh you mean okay so uh yeah so essentially what i need to do i need to flush the std out"
1191600,1201520," uh so is there yeah okay so i i can see i can see that so i forgot to fly"
1201520,1211600," that explains thank you so much thank you thank you thank you thank you all right so and flush is not a"
1211600,1218640," method of std out because it's a method of writable and that's why it didn't complain about not having like"
1218640,1224080," writeable all right so uh that's basically what's going on and this entire chat may fail as well"
1224080,1227120," uh right there we go"
1227120,1234160," uh okay so let's just try to wrap look at that thank you thank you for reminding me to flush"
1235360,1240480," always flush after yourself chat respect the other people always flush"
1240480,1250720," yeah the chat is full of professional flushes exactly so we even have an emote for that we have"
1250720,1256400," an emote for that it's absurd in flush by the way it's available for all of the subscribers so if you"
1256400,1263520," subscribe you can use this epic mode isn't it cool i actually drew it myself seriously i drew it myself"
1263520,1266640," completely just for you so you don't flush"
1266640,1274960," um all right so that's pretty cool all right so we'll keep that in mind"
1274960,1283760," so that means the move to actually works so what about the clear so uh if we try to clear the terminal"
1284560,1293440," what is going to happen uh so it doesn't even compile properly so uh okay so cross term"
1293440,1303440," terminal let's do that uh do we need to add anything else uh clear type so i suppose i suppose"
1303440,1308880," you know what let's actually just import everything that we may ever need"
1308880,1316560," so this is gonna be terminal uh then clear clear all because why not why not just allow you to use"
1316560,1322800," things like that it's gonna be shorter it's gonna be more concise uh it's gonna be more readable uh and"
1322800,1332080," everything the usual things you know so clear all is not in the terminal uh seriously where it is it is in the terminal"
1333360,1342880," uh no clear uh no clear all ah yeah because you don't have to do that it's a clear type i see what you"
1342880,1354160," mean in here there you go so yeah stdq unwrap are you happy now you seem to be more or less happy so i'm"
1354160,1355760," gonna do that and it cleaned everything"
1361600,1366320," so yeah we know how to clean the screen we know how to clean the screen isn't it poggers i think"
1366320,1377760," that's pretty poggers so uh okay so what other commands do we do we have um so can we get the size of"
1377760,1382960," the terminal can we get the size of the terminal i think that would have been kind of useful uh so you"
1382960,1393520," can set the size but can you get the size uh so is row enable blah blah blah blah so maybe there are some"
1393520,1399440," more examples you can okay so there is direct execution okay so for manipulation it is not all"
1399440,1404480," important to be efficient with flash operations for this use case is then execute command okay so we"
1404480,1411680," can execute it directly so that's kind of cool um all right so terminal you can clear the terminal"
1411680,1420720," you can move x blah blah blah style you can print with style and everything um all right so overall i do"
1420720,1427440," understand how this entire thing works so i'm really curious about tty so with tty you can just check whether"
1427440,1429200," something is tty"
1433120,1450800," but how can i oh i think i know what potentially can tell us uh the size of the terminal it's the"
1450800,1462160," event loop because you have resize that's right because you have resize now that's something that's going to be very much useful"
1462160,1469200," uh so people uh so people say the there is a terminal size and i wonder is that true or is that"
1469200,1471760," one of these things that people literally confabulated"
1471760,1479200," so how much you guys bet that this is true and how much it is confabulated by chat gpt"
1479200,1481200," uh"
1481200,1487200," so people say it is true real okay let's let's find out"
1488000,1496000," so we can always just go to terminal uh right so and what kind of functions do we have in the terminal"
1496000,1498880," there is a size look at that it's actually true holy"
1498880,1506000," shit what the it's actually true"
1506000,1508240," yo"
1508240,1520000," so chat telling the truth chat actually telling the truth holy uh also it's import self uh let's import"
1520000,1526560," self and one of the things i would like to do actually i would like to take the terminal size right"
1526560,1532080," so it's going to be terminal uh size and what we get in here we get width and we get height"
1532080,1540560," where did that come from anyway so uh all right so we have width and we we can we have height"
1540560,1551520," and then i can move the cursor somewhere uh cross term cursor and move to so this is one of the things i want"
1551520,1560000," i have so it's actually import self and move to uh and we can move to let's say uh center of the screen"
1560000,1565760," right we can move to center of the screen so it's the out q uh move to and the center of the screen is"
1565760,1570320," just a half of the width and half of the height it's that freaking simple so how do you calculate this"
1570320,1578800," like the center of this thing it's just half a width and half a height can your css do that can you just"
1578800,1582400," center and element in css as easy as that"
1582400,1590160," people say yes i don't believe you actually though it was said by a person who actually"
1590160,1595040," predicted the function name correctly so this is a very good language model so we can i think we can"
1595040,1599280," trust this language model right so uh so the answer is yes"
1602160,1610960," all right so um yeah and then what we can do we can probably print something is there a command that"
1610960,1616720," prints a text i suppose what you do you just like write the text you want to write in there"
1616720,1625760," right so you just say your mom right and and that's it and you just text so yeah so let's uh see so here"
1625760,1631600," we're going to do unwrap um and uh here we're probably also going to do unwrap so on all these"
1631600,1637120," things we will need to do unwrap so let's go to the compilation errors what do we have in here so self"
1637120,1644640," is unused okay you're being annoying like that mother flipper so this is unused it's it's probably"
1644640,1650800," going to be used okay so i'm going to just ignore all this uh then so this is the result okay let's"
1650800,1656640," unwrap this entire thing thank you compiler for telling me that uh right it's not cool that the"
1656640,1661440," static retired compiled languages actually tell you what you have to do i think that's actually pretty"
1661440,1671680," cool so we can take this bytes these bytes uh right so we can take these bytes and um so i think it's not"
1671680,1680160," bytes it's ass bytes if i remember correctly yeah there we go it's ass bytes so did it okay so that's"
1680160,1686880," basically it so let's actually try to do that and your mom to be fair it would be cooler if it slipped"
1686880,1699600," for five seconds or so thread sleep duration from sex uh duration from sex uh right so five sex so we're"
1699600,1703200," gonna have five sex with your mom"
1703200,1715680," okay so to be fair i think your mom is not really centered properly for five sex"
1715680,1723920," uh so what we probably want to do we want to take um let's factor out your mom into a label right so we're"
1723920,1730720," gonna have some sort of a label in here so this is a label and um so yeah people are saying that you can"
1730720,1739120," do put b in here so sure uh one of the things i want to do i actually want to move minus half of the label"
1739120,1749360," length like so so you see uh actually it has to be on the width right so we're centering horizontally right"
1749360,1755200," taking into account the length of the label and vertically uh with just height vertically with"
1755200,1761440," just height so let's actually rebuild uh so let me see what is going on in here label uh but found you"
1761440,1769600," size okay so i mean i can always just say as you 16 will you accept that it will accept that i'm really"
1769600,1776800," happy okay so let's try to do that and go here is your mom perfectly centered here is your mom perfectly"
1776800,1782320," centered so it's it's pretty small so let's actually adjust it to the real size of your mom"
1782320,1787600," so let's make it bigger right so that's that's a little bit closer and look at that"
1787600,1793680," uh so that is centered perfectly"
1793680,1806720," okay uh let me let me see so i feel comfortable with this library so this is literally my first impression"
1807280,1813600," with this library and it's okay it's basically in cursors right so just like a slightly different api"
1813600,1820160," but the the concepts are the same uh the concepts are basically the same so i suppose i can work with"
1820160,1827280," that uh i can in fact work with that so the first thing we probably want to do we want to implement um"
1827280,1833760," a simple chat ui right so we're going to split the screen into essentially the main window that contains"
1833760,1838800," the messages and the prompt where you type your text where you type your little text"
1838800,1850880," uh i pray stop teleporting my mom from her bedroom to your terminal i'll think about that you'll need"
1850880,1857760," to subscribe for that for me to stop doing that all right so i suppose one of the things we'll need"
1857760,1863680," to be able to do we'll need to have an interactive application and an interactive application i suppose"
1863760,1869920," actually handles the events right it actually handles the events so let's go ahead and see how"
1869920,1876400," you're supposed to organize the event loop right so you just organize it uh an infinite loop or some of"
1876400,1882000," one of the things we're doing here right so we essentially import this thing this special thing"
1882000,1888880," let's just put it in here somewhere and we just constantly read we simply constantly read so we can"
1888880,1897360," even do something like while um so yeah so essentially it should never actually break blocks until event"
1897360,1902800," is available okay that's a really weird way of doing that um let me take a look at what exactly returns"
1902800,1912720," what what causes error in this specific case um oh you can even have non this is exactly what we'll need"
1912720,1920000," and chat so this is one of the challenges with implementing this kind of client because we do"
1920000,1928320," need non-blocking events because for example you may we'll need to be able to render the messages as"
1928320,1934960," they come in without you interacting with an app right without you interacting with an app and this"
1934960,1941280," is something that we will need for sure right right right so let's take a look at the poll"
1943280,1952960," so poll uh checks if there is an event available ah right so you can do a timeout right so you first you"
1952960,1959840," can check whether the event is available and only then if it's available you can read it uh-huh so one"
1959840,1969280," of the things you can do right so you are in the main loop and then while uh poll right so poll uh returns"
1969280,1977840," results result right so essentially what you have to do in here is just like unwrap uh you do poll uh you"
1977840,1986000," have to specify the duration duration maybe you can do from sex zero uh is there a duration that says like"
1986000,1997680," none or empty or like something zero yeah there is a duration zero finally they introduced a new zero"
1997680,2006080," all right now you don't have to remember that stupid sign right so you can just use human readable names"
2006080,2011840," for numbers isn't that poggers that's the user friendliness we're always wanting"
2011840,2022480," so while poll is true all right what we're doing we're doing read uh and also unwrap this entire thing"
2022480,2027600," and then we can do match and this is where we can handle all that and that basically provides"
2028640,2036160," essentially asynchronousness asynchronousness uh right so you have a loop you just drain"
2036160,2041840," all the events that you have in the queue with this right so you poll just see is there any ones"
2041840,2049680," okay i handle them all and then without blocking you can continue rendering the next frame so here you would"
2049680,2053440," render the frame if that term is even applicable in the terminal"
2053440,2060800," maybe it is i think it kind of is uh right so i do think it kind of is so that's pretty cool"
2060800,2064320," maybe that's the paradigm we're going to be using here so"
2064320,2075040," that's the paradigm we're going to be using in here uh so now and what kind of events can we even"
2075040,2083040," encounter in here so the events i care about mostly are resize and key right i don't really care about"
2083040,2093920," any other events honestly uh so let's go ahead and just handle those events um so resize so width height"
2093920,2101200," maybe maybe something like this right so let's be a little bit concise in this specific case so it's not"
2101200,2111040," implemented yet and event key and this is the key so let me see what kind of keys we can we can even have"
2111040,2117920," in here so there is a key event okay that's cool and you have a key code beautiful we literally have"
2117920,2124240," everything we literally have everything okay so and apparently it's not just a key it's an event right"
2126000,2136720," it's an entire event it's an entire event uh all right so and i suppose we can we're gonna start"
2136720,2144080," with knowing already existing size of the of the window right it's going to be width and height to be"
2144080,2152880," fair right so yeah maybe it makes sense to actually uh keep track of the resize i think i think it makes"
2152880,2158160," sense uh to keep track of the resize because this operation apparently can fail uh right but if"
2158160,2163040," resize has happened and we received something about it we know that it's not going to fail because it"
2163040,2168400," already happened so yeah i think it makes sense to actually do it like that can i do mutable like this"
2168400,2172240," to indicate that both of these things are mutable or do i have to do it like that"
2174720,2182240," so really can i just say mutable the whole thing we'll see it would be actually ideal in my opinion"
2182240,2188960," if i could do something like that so then i'm going to do a new uh and this one is going to be h and h"
2188960,2194960," there we go so now we have uh up to date width and height of the entire thing and we don't have to wear"
2194960,2201840," worry worry about the size uh failing when we need it right so it's always available it's always up to"
2201840,2209920," date so hopefully if i understand correctly correctly how this entire thing works so i suppose we're just"
2209920,2215280," not going to handle anything yet right so i'm going to leave it empty for now uh right and in here we"
2215280,2220880," probably want to render the whole thing right we're going to render the whole thing so right now we don't"
2220880,2228720," really have anything in the chat we don't really have anything in the chat uh so we need to somehow"
2228720,2235360," separate the main window that we're going to have in here and the prompt so what i'm thinking what"
2235360,2239360," i'm thinking is that maybe we're going to separate it with like a dash line or something"
2239360,2244560," with like a dash line or something i guess think is that a good idea is that a good idea i don't know"
2244560,2250000," uh so since we don't have anything in the main window right since we don't have anything in the"
2250000,2256000," the main window i'm going to skip rendering it so i'm going to actually move the cursor straight to"
2256000,2263760," where we have to draw the line so first of all obviously we probably need to get rid of all of"
2263760,2273600," that so this is just your mom and stuff like that so let's bring all of that stuff uh maybe maybe up"
2274400,2280880," all right so this is the std out uh and everything so and obviously one of the things we need to do we"
2280880,2289360," need to clean everything maybe we have to clean everything on each individual rendering so that does"
2289360,2298640," cross term actually render the differences so they say that they are super efficient does that mean that i can"
2298640,2306160," clean the entire screen clean the entire screen on each individual frame right because if you do that"
2306160,2312720," in a raw terminal you're gonna end up with a lot of flickering right because you clean up everything"
2312720,2319680," one of the things libraries like mcursors do what they do they kind of maintain the internal state of the"
2319680,2326480," terminal then you update then you put some actions on that internal state and then it calculates the difference"
2326480,2332080," and only apply the differences thus reducing the flickering it's like a virtual dom but for the"
2332080,2339440," terminal holy fucking and cursors been doing react before browsers existed"
2339440,2355760," all of the react devs are pissed off"
2356480,2366640," react devs are shaking right now that's right and cursors been doing virtual dom before even windows"
2366640,2372000," existed and cursors is actually pretty old library right isn't it so i think it existed before like"
2372000,2379680," graphical interfaces existed so that means it's it's a precursor to web like literally so"
2383120,2389440," uh you should have seen their reaction to your mutualizer i mean i've seen them in the comments"
2389440,2400800," so that video by the way recently started to blow up it like it has like almost 50 000 uh yeah 50 000"
2400800,2405840," views which is like very unusual for my videos and yeah so i can see that"
2410000,2412320," this is actually quite funny um"
2412320,2423920," all right so i'm gonna assume that it does the virtual dome for the terminals right so it does the"
2423920,2436880," virtual dome so and now um what can we do so how does it index the the cells how the cells are indexed are"
2436880,2444080," this indexed from zero or at the indexed from one um so that's a good question i want to take a look at"
2444080,2449040," the let me close everything so when i have too many things open it just becomes a little bit overwhelming"
2449040,2453760," uh so here's the cursor and there should be a command to move to"
2455360,2465520," so top left cell represented as zero zero perfect cool so now we can we can work with that so essentially"
2465520,2469200," we need to do uh std out q"
2469200,2479360," move to and uh we're gonna be moving to in terms of x zero right so we're going to be in the left side and in"
2479360,2487680," in terms of height the last row is h minus one so that means we need to step one up so that means"
2487680,2495680," can be minus two right so there we go so this is going to be q so we move there and now we need to fill"
2495680,2502960," this thing up with dashes is there something that could help us to do that uh so is there something that"
2502960,2508080," could help us to do that so where is the command okay so let me take a look at the list of all of"
2508080,2514320," the commands so there's a height maybe there's something like feel i don't know probably not it's"
2514320,2519360," probably something that we'll have to do ourselves uh the easiest way to do that probably would be to"
2519920,2530080," just for uh zero to width and just keep doing std right or something uh right but what uh kind of stuff"
2530080,2537920," do we have in in there so rust up doc uh open uh right so i i think i think it's without open an idiot"
2541440,2552000," uh so api let's take a look at the api so what do we have in the right interface so it's gonna be io"
2552000,2562640," interface i suppose um you can only write like a whole buffer you can not easily write a single thing"
2563280,2572560," though we actually catch a moment we actually catch a moment when we resize the thing so we can"
2572560,2580960," basically maintain some sort of a string that has the bar that we want to draw and every time we resize"
2580960,2589360," we update this thing right so we could have something like um bar which is a string new right so it could"
2589360,2596320," be mutable so it is going to be updated every time um and what's the easiest way to actually assign"
2596320,2602080," this kind of bar can you do that with a format um so i don't remember how to use format rest"
2602080,2609680," format repeat so let me see i don't i didn't really know the syntax fill string with repeated characters okay"
2609680,2614640," can you repeat like n times that's that's very interesting question"
2619360,2644080," okay so well this one is also kind of str repeat okay this one sounds interesting i really like that one"
2644640,2651840," uh so repeat uh so repeat uh look at that str repeat"
2651840,2660960," yeah boy and it returns string it's a part of str but okay that's actually perfect believe it or not"
2660960,2668000," so um str repeat w and yeah"
2668000,2681280," is there really that okay but is there something for bytes as well right something for bytes"
2681280,2688400," because we'll need that in bytes probably but yeah so and essentially what we can do we can just do write"
2689600,2699040," bar as bytes and simply unwrap it here so that's basically it and we probably need to move the"
2699040,2707840," cursor now to down right so it's going to be h1 like so and then we do the flush so we just do the flush"
2707840,2715280," so that should be it essentially though we have a little bit of a busy looping in here"
2716320,2722560," right a little bit of a busy looping so we probably need to sleep for a little bit so let's actually"
2722560,2735760," sleep for um you know maybe for sex but f as f32 one over like 60 what's the 60 fps does anybody remember"
2736480,2746160," um one over 16 okay so maybe maybe it's going to be m sex and it's going to be 16 right so milliseconds"
2746160,2752400," 16 milliseconds is 60 fps right so we're going to be rendering our terminal application in 60 fps"
2755360,2764320," is that is that is that good uh maybe 30 maybe 30 is going to be better uh so where is the python python"
2764320,2774320," 3 um 130 so 33 essentially we can we can put 33 um so that's basically it"
2776880,2784960," so this is an interactive application um this is an interactive application so now if i try to rebuild"
2784960,2790320," that let's go to the compilation errors let's go to the compilation errors and see what we have so"
2790320,2798720," oh all right so apparently this is such a common mistakes that they even added a help in here"
2799600,2805120," right because you you won't even believe that this is how you have to do that right so you can have one"
2805120,2810400," thing mutable and another thing not mutable for whatever reason right so what else do we have in"
2810400,2819200," here so poll is not available poll is a part of the term all right uh so i'm gonna just make a boldest"
2819200,2827360," um yeah it's it's probably event right so this is an event so what else do we have in here str repeat"
2827360,2834480," so is that because uh so function expected two arguments ah because you have to specify what"
2834480,2844160," exactly do you want to repeat oh it's a method of some oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh okay"
2844160,2848000," repeat so this is not how it works i'm an idiot so you're supposed to do something like"
2848640,2855360," this yeah i'm really happy that the compiler just told me that isn't that poggers that you have like"
2855360,2860720," a compiler that tells you this kind of shit i think this is absolutely fucking poggers uh what's what's"
2860720,2875680," the next thing uh usa okay i mean just just convert it to you size all right so m sex um so it doesn't have"
2875680,2881120," um milliseconds okay so let's actually search for like what kind of methods do we even happen there"
2881120,2896480," duration from uh duration from millis it's not m sex it's millis did you guys know millis uh and"
2896480,2904640," it takes you 64 okay uh all right so there's some other stuff and um so not everything is handled right"
2904640,2910000," not everything is handled so for the uh for the rest of the things we basically gonna ignore all these"
2910000,2915040," things right so we only care about resize and potentially the keys right potentially the keys"
2915040,2920720," and i go so event is not even handled yet we're gonna handle it in the future there we go we went to the"
2920720,2926080," compilation interest and now we potentially have an interactive applications we don't really know so"
2926080,2932320," let's actually go ahead and run this thing so let's actually uh reduce it right i'm gonna do cargo run"
2932880,2940240," and let me see what we have okay so i have to specify uh bin client it's like been chilling"
2940240,2951440," and i can't see in this mist so it didn't work writing into that thing literally did not work i wonder why"
2951440,2955280," why though um um because i'm an idiot"
2955280,2962640," there we go"
2962640,2965360," look at it"
2965360,2971840," and it updates accordingly it updates accordingly"
2971840,2979360," right i can't really type anything into it i can try to type something but it doesn't allow me to do"
2979360,2980160," that but yeah"
2980160,2990880," so this is the simple we need something more interesting this is kind of dumb can we have"
2990880,2996080," there are some i can't select chat by the way it doesn't allow me to select chat because it's constantly"
2996080,3006320," refreshing and maybe this is something where uh we have to um you know um implement the mouse moving and"
3006320,3007840," stuff like that um"
3007840,3010640," so yeah"
3010640,3013600," so that's pretty cool"
3013600,3023520," that is pretty pretty cool um so and we can chat chat we can implement something very epic i think"
3023520,3029040," we can uh implement immediate mode rendering"
3029600,3039040," right immediate mode rendering so essentially uh right we're gonna have the main window right and the"
3039040,3045200," new input and stuff like that uh and all of them are going to be sort of separate components that you"
3045200,3049920," call and they do the thing so they're probably going to be accepting the std out they're probably going"
3049920,3056720," going to be even accepting the cubicle commands right maybe cubicle command plus uh right but i think cubicle"
3056720,3062880," command kind of implies that you're also writable right because it's extending this entire thing so"
3062880,3067280," let me let me take a look at this thing um no it's not really extending"
3068880,3078880," so you're just implementing ah okay so yeah cubicle command for t where t is right writable and also"
3078880,3084800," size but i don't remember what question mark means but i mean whatever so if i have components right"
3084800,3090640," something like uh chat window chat window uh i can basically"
3090640,3100800," accept this thing as an implementation of cubicle commands right maybe mutable implementation of cubicle command"
3100800,3105920," and uh that is going to be abstract enough right it's going to be abstract enough and it will also"
3105920,3111680," include all of the right commands and stuff like that uh all the right commands and stuff like that"
3113680,3119920," this is so funny like we found very simple and straightforward solution to the problem"
3119920,3125040," and rust developers be like why not this monstrosity all of a sudden"
3125040,3136640," seriously like this is the most straightforward readable solution you have a thing repeated n times"
3136640,3138160," and then we have rust developers"
3138160,3142560," because it's not cool enough it's too readable yes"
3143680,3153600," i swear to god i swear to god rust people i swear to god rust people"
3153600,3160720," that's literally exactly why everybody laughs at you that's literally exactly why"
3160720,3166480," so you have a good solution good readable simple solution and you're suggesting that"
3170560,3180800," that's not serious come on that's not serious um so does anybody remember so there is sort of like a ascii"
3180800,3187760," thingy that actually connects perfectly all of the cells how is it called right uh so"
3187760,3197840," this kind of thing so there's ascii uh ascii characters for like ui or something so i don't remember"
3197840,3203280," their name so ascii boxes maybe uh all right so let's actually go for google"
3203280,3209920," so box drawing characters that's probably what uh what we need in here box drawing"
3209920,3214480," uh all right so"
3214480,3224080," okay so let's just grab this thing and replace that stuff with that so hopefully that will connect perfectly"
3225600,3232480," and we're gonna just rebuild this entire thing and boom look at that beautiful line look at that smooth"
3232480,3233760," beautiful line holy"
3233760,3237280," you can see the seams"
3237280,3247280," unacceptable what like why there are seams in there it's not it's not perfectly flushed"
3250880,3260240," it's not pixel perfect the fuck um um can we just do something like this there's a big x in here"
3260240,3266320," all right maybe we can even do um so bar char"
3266320,3269680," just put it in here"
3272480,3276000," bar chart bar chart bar chart"
3276000,3278960," semicolon"
3278960,3285680," imagine asking for semicoles in 2023 uh okay look at that look at that"
3285680,3290880," and the shirt is also not perfect like why"
3294400,3305680," what the the the fuck right um so what's going to be the next thing we need to handle input fields"
3305680,3311360," somehow right i suppose we need to handle input fields somehow um what i'm thinking is that we can"
3311360,3320560," just go ahead and handle events and look for the uh ascii characters um so where is the cross term"
3321280,3327920," uh so event i want to find the definition of the event so here is the event"
3327920,3336880," um key key event so there's a key state it represents uh extra state and probably don't really care about"
3336880,3349280," that so here's the key event and you have key code key code key code and do so okay so here are this oh my god"
3349280,3353200," you have to do that"
3353200,3357600," thank you thank you thank you so much but um"
3357600,3366080," okay so i don't have to do all right i can just take the character oh okay"
3366080,3378240," so what that means uh i can have a prompt which is a string right every time um event code is was it code"
3378240,3383440," i think it was just code code code and uh i can just match that goddamn code"
3383440,3390400," and within the code we have uh key code key code"
3390400,3398560," character x and i can just push that thing into the prompt from push x look at that"
3398560,3406400," look at that isn't that beautiful so if we uh see something else we're going to ignore it for now so that's totally fine"
3406400,3414400," and then at the bottom when we went in here so here we are just drawing the bar so this is the bar"
3414400,3418480," and here we can try to render the prompt right so we can try to render the prompt"
3418480,3427440," uh so and i'm going to do qq and actually not click you just i'm going to write a prompt as bytes"
3428480,3435680," unwrap there we go so let's try to compile that uh key code uh where is the key code that is defined"
3435680,3439840," so it's defined within the event uh so let's do key code"
3439840,3447200," uh so what does we have so prompt is not mutable so let's actually make it super quick"
3447760,3453360," and now are you ready chat oh"
3453360,3456240," ooh"
3456240,3460320," uh-huh"
3460320,3464800," that is very interesting"
3468560,3470320," so we need to yeah cooked"
3470320,3476720," this person knows what's up they even use like a correct terminology"
3476720,3481440," more or less i don't know is that like official terminology for the terminals but yeah"
3481440,3489760," in in the terminal world there is this slang for like terminals there's a row terminal and the opposite"
3489760,3496000," of row is cooked terminal right so and in in this specific mode we cannot be super interactive so we need"
3496000,3501920," to switch to the row mode but i expect that the cross term allows you to do that easily right"
3501920,3507600," does that allow you to do this easily i'm pretty sure it does uh so because we have a terminal thing"
3507600,3516080," right terminal package uh so let me go somewhere here so this is the terminal and i'm pretty sure it has"
3516080,3524880," something enable row mode okay so let's go ahead and do that enable row mode uh yeah"
3526960,3532240," so we take the terminal size maybe it will make sense actually do terminal uh enable"
3532240,3538960," row mode gotcha hyper there we go and and then i'm gonna just ignore this and i think"
3538960,3546880," uh so let me see it seems to be compiling and the chat are you ready"
3549360,3556960," look how reactive the shed is look how reactive the shed is we can't do backspace we only can actually"
3556960,3562320," append things in here we can't really do much when we press enter nothing is going to happen but we can"
3562320,3563920," try to handle them"
3563920,3575280," the moment i realize that i'm fucked i'm pressing ctrl c"
3584160,3584800," so okay"
3584800,3590640," how is it called client"
3590640,3594240," it's actually grippy p"
3594240,3598160," okay kill all client"
3598160,3599440," bam"
3600960,3606080," what can we do in here that's a very interesting why don't you handle ctrl c"
3606080,3615120," motherboard we can try to handle so there should be some modifiers modifiers uh key modifier okay"
3619440,3625280," and one of the modifier so uh-huh so it's a struct"
3625280,3636720," and it has methods and it has contains whether all set bits in a source flag value are also set in a"
3636720,3644240," target flags value so yeah you can check for the specific thing and then okay so you can see if the"
3644240,3652320," modifier contains control for instance or something like that right so and in here we can quickly do that"
3652320,3656720," so essentially if x is equal c and"
3656720,3672400," event modifiers uh fires contains so and uh key modifiers contains key modifiers uh control"
3673760,3686640," then let's introduce something like quit while not quit while not quit and what we're doing here"
3686640,3691360," we just put true in here and then go simple like that"
3691360,3703600," so use of an declared key modifiers okay so let's i i'm going to assume that"
3703600,3704480," that it comes from here"
3704480,3706960," and"
3706960,3723200," who needs posix signals who needs posix signals if you can just handle control c c uh all right"
3723200,3733440," just handle control c it's that simple mate uh all right so essentially we can"
3733440,3740400," now do a pretty cool thing uh so we have a state which is prompt and stuff like that we can introduce"
3740400,3744640," like a chat which is going to be a vector of strings right"
3744640,3749680," so you you know where it is going"
3749680,3759040," you know where it is going right uh so now we can try to handle enter right so when we do key code"
3759920,3769200," there is an enter in here so we can do key code enter and i can go in here and essentially i can do prompt"
3769200,3777040," push um actually chat push prompt but we have to make a copy so we'll have to clone this entire thing"
3777040,3782880," and there we go and after that we need to clean this entire thing can you just clear or clean or something"
3782880,3790080," like that uh i think it should be able to write so and now uh every time we press enter we sort of append"
3790080,3798320," a thing uh into the chat so but we need to actually render that somehow we need to render that somehow"
3798320,3807440," uh so essentially uh so here we render the bar here we render the prompt so what we need to do we need to"
3807440,3813440," iterate through all of the lines in the problem in the chat right so for a line in chat so we probably"
3813440,3819680," have to do something like iter right so we do something like iter and now essentially"
3819680,3828880," uh we need to move the cursor to the corresponding row but to know the corresponding row we need to enumerate"
3829600,3836720," uh each individual individual line in the chat so we know the row where to move uh right so this is"
3836720,3841760," going to be something like that so here is the row we're moving into that row and then we're writing the"
3841760,3847200," value of the chat the value of the line right but we have to do that as bytes of course we have to do"
3847200,3855280," that as bytes uh and there we go so i know that i don't check the bounds i know that i do that intentionally"
3855280,3862560," just to get something working already on the screen right so we just do that uh and that should be it"
3862560,3871520," actually that should be so let me uh let me see so so as u16 so that is understandable and there we go"
3871520,3877440," that's pretty cool chat are you ready uh are you ready so there is a little bit of a problem we don't"
3877440,3884320," reset the state of the terminal but it doesn't matter are you ready chat"
3884320,3900880," first try easy peasy lemon squeezy it's that easy it's that easy but of course we don't uh"
3900880,3910640," really like reset the the terminal look at it so we have to disable the row mode right by the way if"
3910640,3918800," you stack with the terminal in incorrect mode just blindly type reset i just blindly type type reset"
3918800,3924480," and press enter and it will work until reset the terminal right just just in case right so if you"
3924480,3929520," ever get yourself into this kind of situation just reset the state of the channel uh right"
3931840,3938480," we already have a base of the chat application chat it's so yeah it's pretty cool to be fair it's not"
3938480,3943200," that uh revolutionary this is literally the experience you would get"
3945360,3951120," uh if you use in cursors for instance this is basically in cursors implemented in rust"
3951120,3955760," right it's just like in the cursors implemented and that's what it feels like"
3955760,3961200," um right but it's but it's a modern one and also it supports windows i mean in course there's"
3961200,3970320," a version of in cursors for windows too so that's totally fine um anyways so i suppose i know that in the"
3970320,3979600," uh right there is disable yeah disable row mode so that's what we can do so when you do escape uh we"
3979600,3987200," can do terminal disable row mode and it can fail i'm gonna i'm gonna make an assumption that it fails"
3987200,3991760," and i'm gonna try to compile that and yeah apparently it can fail look at that"
3993680,3998720," that's pretty cool so that means if i run the center i think uh do this kind of stuff and then"
3998720,4004960," control c it's totally fine so it resets the state of the terminal it resets the state of the terminal"
4004960,4010640," it's pretty cool uh okay guys so but there is a little bit of a problem in here so let me"
4010640,4015600," demonstrate you um let me demonstrate you um there is a tiny bit of a problem"
4015600,4027040," oh oh yeah so the problem is it actually um goes out of bounds right it goes out of bounds so we"
4027040,4031680," need to limit it somehow uh right we need to limit it somehow"
4034160,4044880," uh so let me let me let me see so essentially we have the size of the chat window right so we can"
4044880,4050960," even say something like chat uh window height right so this is a chat window height"
4050960,4056960," to be fair honestly uh i would love to maybe"
4058640,4065200," have a notion of the rectangle right so have a notion of the rectangle uh so struct let's call it"
4065200,4074320," rect and the rect is going to be um x y wh and all of them are going to be u16 and essentially we can"
4074320,4082320," have a chat window right so chat window that accepts std out as a queueable command a mutable pointer to"
4082320,4087680," implementation of a queueable command and uh boundary right so we're going to accept rectangle as a"
4087680,4093360," boundary like so and what this is going to do is going to just render this entire thing it is going"
4093360,4101360," to just render uh this entire thing within the boundary within the boundary uh but there is a little"
4101360,4109600," bit of a problem in here uh there is a little bit of a problem in here with um the state of the chat"
4109600,4114960," window because the chat window probably should have some sort of like a scrollable state uh but i think"
4114960,4123760," what we can do essentially we can simply render uh only the last n things right so an n is boundary"
4123760,4130640," height right and is boundary height so we're only going to render the last n things"
4130640,4136640," so and i wonder if there's easy way to do that so in here we're going to accept not only boundary"
4136640,4144080," we're also going to accept the chat and we can accept it as the slice of strings right so this is going to"
4144080,4149280," be slice of strings because we have a chat as the vector where we append things and this is going to be"
4149280,4160560," slice of things so is there a function that acts like an iterator but takes the last n characters or not"
4160560,4170720," we really really right so essentially uh we have two situations if chat length is less or equal than n"
4170720,4178720," or maybe we can just directly refer to as height we can just draw it as it is we can just draw it as it is"
4179280,4193280," but but but but uh if uh this entire thing is greater if it's greater what we have to do we have to take"
4193280,4203520," chat as an iterator right we have to check the chat as an iterator and drop uh chat len minus boundary h"
4203520,4208800," characters so that's what i'm talking about so that's what we have to do and that's how we take"
4208800,4216480," the last h of them right so uh that's how we can do that so maybe it would make sense to even factor"
4216480,4226960," out this as n right so that would make sense so we don't borrow this into places and uh then we can even"
4226960,4237360," just map it right so maybe i can do for uh line in like so uh and when i'm rendering this entire thing"
4237360,4244000," uh i'm gonna be moving to a specific place right so i'm just basically moving to a specific place"
4244000,4249360," uh all right so in terms of x i'm moving to the boundary"
4251120,4260160," x uh always and in terms of row i'm moving to the boundary y plus row and we want to enumerate this"
4260160,4271680," entire stuff right so we'll enumerate uh like so so that gives us the row like this maybe we can even call"
4271680,4284000," a dy there we go so that's basically the dy that's basically the dy so that's pretty cool"
4284000,4295520," and uh yeah so it we need to have this condition because these things are unsigned so you can't really"
4295520,4302080," subtract these kind of things properly uh so we are only checking the the boundary overflow we're not"
4302080,4306480," checking the where the the lines that we're rendering actually fit in there right now we're"
4306480,4312320," going to do that a little bit later so it doesn't really matter though we can we can kind of already"
4312320,4319520," do that or can we um so i'm pretty sure we can yeah so we can do that through the slices and everything"
4319520,4323440," so we can do easily do that through the slices so what i would like to do right now i'd like to"
4323440,4332080," get rid of this condition i'll make it a little bit prettier uh right so essentially we can have m"
4332080,4341360," it's basically how many things you have to drop uh all right and if uh this thing you drop zero things"
4341360,4350480," otherwise you drop uh this amount of things and then you just do it like that so we factored out"
4350480,4357040," this particular condition so it's going to drop zero uh right if it actually perfectly fits so i'm talking"
4357040,4364240," about so it's sort of like um we could do something like this and say uh maximum between this and zero"
4364240,4371040," but both of these things are unsigned int and is you size this is you 16 you can't really easily do that"
4371040,4379040," unless maybe uh unsigned have some sort of like a special sub right if you if i have you size do you have sub"
4379040,4385360," that returns optional or something like that so that will be interesting actually so you size as a type"
4385360,4390160," i'm looking at the wrong thing i'm looking at the wrong thing so i need to find your size"
4392400,4403120," so sub assign checked sub uh where is it oh it's it's loading yeah it's loading the page yeah that's"
4403120,4413360," what i'm talking about yeah so it can that is actually kind of cool so we can use that essentially i can say"
4413360,4422720," an sub boundary h and it returns your option and then you can unwrap with default or something so"
4422720,4431280," option uh unwrap um i don't remember how it is called unwrap or default right so you do unwrap"
4431280,4437360," uh wrap or default is going to be zero and there we go so that's what we got"
4438960,4445680," so uh people say unwrap or um yeah so it's just unwrap or doesn't matter i mean i got it right so"
4445680,4452080," that makes it so it's actually checked sub by the way so it's checked sub but yeah so that makes it"
4452080,4459440," prettier it makes it i'm gonna say that i'm gonna say that word get ready it makes it"
4460720,4471040," so that's the word everyone must obey it's ideomatic holy fucking shit it doesn't solve"
4471040,4476240," any problem it doesn't fucking work it crashes but it's idiomatic holy fucking"
4482160,4491040," idiomatic code what the fuck uh all right so you see it doesn't even compile right but it's idiomatic"
4491040,4497840," what the fuck all right so what we have so is this not how you do that"
4497840,4506800," really i mean uh okay can i you you're not allowed to do shit like that in in rust you can't group several"
4506800,4512960," things really really you really have to do it like this way this stupid way"
4512960,4525840," it's being custom so and we can do your size in here sure"
4529200,4535280," uh drop drop drop what is it called by the way so let's take a look at the iterator"
4535280,4541840," uh iterator what kind of methods do we have i swear to god all these functional languages they"
4541840,4547040," call these operations basic operations differently they can't agree on how to call this thing like"
4547040,4552160," one calls it drop another one calls it your mom whatever so what do they call it in here"
4553840,4566560," so there is no drop there is no drop find flat escape uh ski of course you dummy dumb dumb didn't"
4566560,4572160," you know that famous basic operations skip that literally is called skip in all of the functional"
4572160,4581200," languages did you know that yeah anyway so uh it's called skip okay what else do we have"
4582480,4591600," so right uh exist for mutable oh exist for mutable references but its trade bound are not satisfied"
4591600,4608160," i see so the following trade bounds were not satisfying std which is required by std right consider"
4608160,4616960," restricting the data parameter to satisfy the trade bound uh-huh where impl that is this"
4616960,4628000," okay i mean sure why do you make it so difficult for me to just pass this thing somewhere"
4630480,4638720," is there like a less robust way of saying this kind of can i okay can i just say plus right"
4638720,4644960," can i just say plus right please"
4649920,4663760," you can't do you can't do that okay um"
4663760,4670000," all right um"
4676240,4681440," though interestingly we can just accept right i think"
4681440,4690800," oh you it has to be t yeah but just a second i think we can just accept right because this extension"
4690800,4701760," kind of works for writes too yeah i can just accept right you all are wrong you all are wrong that's the"
4701760,4708080," the easiest way to solve that okay okay so uh rect is never constructed so let's try to construct"
4708080,4717600," um okay how can we gonna be constructed all that um so let me let me see"
4721680,4727200," uh uh so in this by the way is very dangerous because h could be um less than two right"
4727200,4737680," uh less than two but anyway so chat window uh let me actually see chat window right so this is going"
4737680,4744480," to be that and i'm going to just pass it by a mutable thingy the boundary is going to be interesting"
4744480,4750480," uh right might as well actually i think i want to put the chat before the boundary"
4750480,4759200," because it will make it easier do something cool like this and here you specify all of that"
4759200,4770640," is that it's almost like you're using you like this trendy ui framework like it's a chat window and you"
4770640,4775040," specify the boundaries like that oh my god"
4775040,4785120," uh okay so here this is basically zero zero right so this is basically zero zero width is going to be the"
4785120,4792400," same and height uh i suppose height is uh minus two right so it's it's literally this height minus two"
4792400,4802000," uh this one is two all right so what do we have in here uh so the chat is just basically this uh so"
4802000,4810640," and what do we have in here so w is never red i mean that's fine do you come yeah it does in fact compile"
4810640,4821920," right it does in fact compile so that's pretty cool uh and uh let me see so it does in fact compile so"
4821920,4829040," we need to test how well it actually cuts things right so we're gonna do one two three four five six"
4829040,4840400," seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen uh i can't delete okay right but as you can"
4840400,4847840," see it does actually cut things out right and it adapts properly and stuff like that over time right"
4847840,4855280," so it kind of adapts to all this stuff since we're using these boxes we can actually put some extra stuff"
4855280,4861440," around these things so i don't think it's gonna be that like hard but we can do that a little bit"
4861440,4868400," later uh but yeah so control c and uh seems to be working so the only thing we don't do we don't cut"
4868400,4875680," horizontally right we only cut vertically so let's go ahead and try to do that uh so it should be pretty"
4875680,4882480," step forward right it should be pretty step forward because we just need to essentially take uh"
4883280,4895360," so this is the bytes right so this is simply the bytes zero uh boundary h the w right but if w is"
4895360,4900720," bigger than the amount of bytes it's not really going to work uh one of the things we can do let's"
4900720,4908160," actually factor out the bytes like so let's factor out the bytes and let's do a little bit of a condition"
4908720,4919760," so if bytes is less than the or equal boundary w you just do that otherwise you uh do it like that uh so"
4919760,4933840," doesn't even"
4933840,4940720," doesn't even compile anyway so this has to be you can i just make this entire thing use size right away"
4940720,4943520," because um yeah"
4943520,4954640," i kind of feel that maybe i should make it even signed because having signed things like that in"
4954640,4961360," here makes it easier to do mathematical computations but i didn't get there yet i didn't get there yet"
4961360,4967600," so let's actually start with just using u sizes in here so let me see i have to do that uh well i mean"
4967600,4971920," well i don't think this is kind of kind of"
4973440,4982400," as what else do we have in here so this is the bytes it has to be the pointer um i feel like"
4982400,4993840," slices i vaguely remember chats slices get have get slices have get and they return they accept range"
4993840,4997520," right so the index can be also right yeah this is what i'm talking about"
4998320,5005520," this is what i'm talking about you can get the range like that and then you can do some epic"
5005520,5012960," hackery right so essentially let's actually abstract away from all this stuff you can take as bytes"
5012960,5019920," then you can get from zero to boundary uh boundary wh right and then uh unwrap"
5019920,5026880," or use the original bytes in that case maybe replacing it with the original bytes like that would be easy"
5028320,5032720," and what we're doing here right so can we even"
5032720,5041680," so let's put it like this then it's going to be just a single line is that idiomatic enough"
5041680,5049760," is that idiomatic enough so hopefully it is so let's continue what else we have in here so as you says"
5052240,5063760," and honestly we can just keep those things as you says can't we uh but maybe not let's actually"
5063760,5066240," keep it like that so as you says"
5066240,5072320," all right so what do you want in here uh yeah"
5078080,5086320," okay so let's have something long okay it does cut it"
5086320,5089760," yikes"
5089760,5101200," so in case of the chat prompt we have to do the same thing we have to do the same thing"
5102960,5108400," uh right so we'll go ahead and do that so as you can see we're just like implementing something"
5108400,5114960," we're looking at what's broken and we fixed that um so i can literally just copy paste the code that we"
5114960,5126800," rolled in there uh so something like this uh and we can just do it like that so uh-huh so this is the bytes"
5126800,5135520," but the bytes but the bytes of the prompt though i can even put that in here so prompt get uh unwrap"
5135520,5144080," the bytes and rumped and then print the bytes like well i mean yeah that's it so maybe"
5144080,5150800," we could factor out this thing"
5154160,5159120," um oh this one is very interesting because for the prompt we want to we don't want to show the"
5159120,5162400," last one we want to show the first one"
5162400,5168640," but maybe maybe it's fine for for now for now i think it's fine right so we can refine all of that"
5168640,5174560," a little bit later uh so slices and this is our type you size or ranges of your size so okay"
5174560,5186240," so as you use size so now if i try to do that uh okay so it basically it goes there outside but doesn't"
5186240,5195920," work properly but i mean it's it's fine it's fine for now it's fine for now so uh we have a simple like"
5195920,5202480," window that can potentially asynchronously receive things potentially asynchronously receive things and"
5202480,5210640," that's actually kind of cool i think um so we one thing we need to be able to do we need to be able to"
5210640,5218720," paste the token we need to be able to paste the token uh right so i remember in cross term"
5219680,5228400," there was a command for copy pasting it's actually in events right so where are the events"
5228400,5235280," look at they literally support copy pasting that's actually pretty cool"
5236800,5244320," um so we didn't see p p p p p p p p where is the paste what the um paste"
5244320,5253360," enable bracket paste huh okay so event"
5253360,5256160," paste"
5258560,5263280," okay okay that's that's weird uh so it's just a string all right"
5263280,5270960," uh let's go ahead and just support that uh event uh paste"
5270960,5278560," data and what we're going to be doing we're going to be literally just um you know"
5278560,5285440," appending that to a prompt can i do prompt push data or something maybe pushes i think there was like a"
5285440,5286160," push str"
5286160,5290800," yo okay"
5290800,5303200," uh your mom i'm copy pasting this i'm copy pasting now let me restart and i'm"
5311200,5314960," oh this is not how we do that but we can actually add support for this kind of commands like click"
5314960,5325200," or something so now honestly we can already plug it in to a chat like we can already turn this into a chat"
5325200,5332720," client or something like who said we can't we can do that basically uh so the only thing we need to do"
5333360,5335360," essentially is just to"
5335360,5338240," use std"
5338240,5340880," net tcp stream"
5340880,5347840," and just keep receiving the data from the server"
5347840,5353600," and then when we receive the data we can just push it into the prompt and stuff like that who said we can't do that"
5354800,5364320," um so i think that's pretty cool so but you know what i think the time has come to make a smoke break chat"
5364320,5371280," the time has come i've been slapping the good for one and half of an hour i ran out of tea i'm running"
5371280,5376240," out of steam so let's make a small break i'm gonna refill the cup of tea and then we're gonna plug"
5376240,5384560," our chat application this is basically like a chat application right so uh so it has a window right"
5384560,5389920," it's it has a prompt so all of the components are in there so this is the basic chat application"
5389920,5396960," so yeah we just need to plug it into the terminal into the into the network and it will probably work"
5396960,5404320," with uh with the rest of the stuff so yeah let's make some break and um okay so uh let's go ahead"
5404320,5410240," and connect to the server right so we already have a tcp stream so the first thing we can try to do we"
5410240,5419440," can try to establish the tcp connection um so do i have this stuff open so i have only opened yeah so here"
5419440,5429200," is the global documentation uh i can't see the can't see the scroll bar um so tcp stream i am very sure"
5429200,5442800," tcp stream just has a connect method simply connect method uh zozin tcp stream when today um so tcp stream"
5443680,5452160," connect uh so and the way i'm gonna be connecting so uh 27 001 69 69 we're gonna hard code it for now"
5452160,5458320," uh right so i'm doing unwraps because this is a client right so i usually try to avoid unwraps on"
5458320,5464880," the server because it has to be like a high availability service right so that's why i'm trying"
5464880,5469440," to handle errors and stuff like that but the client i mean client doesn't have to be high availability so"
5469440,5474320," let's crash that so uh so here is a stream so we get the stream"
5474320,5481840," uh and uh i feel like one of the things we'll probably need to do with this thing we need to"
5481840,5487600," make it non-blocking you know what i'm talking about so because this entire thing is going to be very much"
5487600,5495760," asynchronous right so it has to be uh you know uh off sync with ui ui and the stream should be sort of"
5495760,5502960," like updated uh asynchronously so one of the things we can do we can just set non-blocking uh non-blocking"
5502960,5509840," to true right set non-blocking to true and uh unwrap this into i think and of course here we're going"
5509840,5515440," to just do it like that so now this entire thing is non-blocking and every time we're reading from it"
5515440,5522560," we are like given um i don't remember what we're giving i think it returns an error uh so what does"
5522560,5529280," it do moves the tcp stream into into or out of non-blocking mode this will result in read write"
5529280,5534640," receive send operations becoming non-blocking uh immediate that is immediately returning from their"
5534640,5541360," calls if the operation is successful a key is returned uh and no further action is required if the"
5541360,5547680," operation could be could not be completed and needed to be retrie uh retried the error will be"
5547680,5554480," uh kind would block okay so we'll have to check the error and see if it's would block and in that case"
5554480,5561840," we assume that the data is not available yet right so something like that um so makes sense to me makes"
5561840,5570880," sense to me so uh we're draining all of the events in here right so we're just simply draining all the"
5570880,5578080," events in here in here we can try to read something from the stream so to read something we probably need"
5578080,5583280," a buffer all right so let's introduce introduce a buffer so usually the the size of the buffer that i use"
5583280,5593360," for this chat is uh 64 64 bytes right so um let's put it this way uh it's gonna be zero like 64 zeros"
5593360,5602800," like this uh stream read and i'm just reading the buffer right this can be mutable i think i didn't"
5602800,5613280," declare it as mutable uh yeah i didn't so let's actually do mutable not mat mutable uh stream read"
5613280,5620720," so in this entire thing we're gonna just unwrap it uh like so and not really unwrap it right so it may"
5620720,5628160," be an error right so it may be an error so we can match this entire stuff right and if it's okay"
5628720,5634560," right if it is okay uh we know how much we read right i know that read returns you how much it read"
5634560,5642000," what we can do we can just take a buffer and we take we can take um this amount of things"
5642000,5647760," and we can turn it into a string right i think you can do to string and we're gonna append it to the chat"
5647760,5655360," uh so we're gonna just do push uh like so so we have push okay if it's an error"
5656240,5664640," uh we should check its kind all right so it's a result uh an error i remember that io error"
5664640,5672400," has a kind yeah there we go so it has a kind so that means we need to check uh maybe if error kind"
5672400,5680720," equal maybe not equal uh error kind would block so they said that the error kind is going to be would block"
5681680,5693440," uh would block yeah it does exist would block if it is not that i suppose we can panic right so"
5693440,5696800," i suppose we can panic"
5696800,5702800," um doing something like this i don't know it's just something like error"
5708240,5717120," so otherwise we can accept that and that's basically it so another thing uh when you press"
5717120,5723920," enter when you press enter we add that thing to the chat but on top of that we need to send that"
5723920,5728320," to uh the server right so we also need to send that to the server"
5730240,5736720," so let's go ahead and do that so stream right uh prompt and i can just take that well i mean i need"
5736720,5740000," to do as bytes right i'm sending the bytes"
5740000,5744080," i am sending the bytes"
5744080,5755120," panicking and on io errors exactly panicking on your errors i'm going to unwrap this into i think as well"
5756480,5761200," though panicking here is not particularly great idea because we can end up with the terminal in a"
5761200,5769600," not particularly great state but i don't care right so uh so i'm just prototyping this entire thing so"
5769600,5775360," let's go to the compilation errors uh chat uh push uh it's actually"
5775360,5784320," yeah so this is what i want what else do we have error kind is not available so i suppose error kind is"
5784320,5795120," available in stdio uh so let's just include it in here error kind what else we have uh read"
5795120,5803760," no method named read and this is because we need to import io read so we have write but we also need"
5803760,5811920," read what else do we have okay so this expression has type use size expect you to size but found"
5813040,5819680," um that is um that is bizarre that is bizarre what exactly is going on in here because uh i would"
5819680,5830080," expect the read the thing game read uh where is the read to just return yeah i would expect it to just"
5830080,5841760," return that um oh because we unwrap we should not unwrap it okay yeah so it was just a reflex so to string"
5841760,5850400," um so this has to be a pointer um so this has to be a pointer um you know what so this is the stuff"
5850400,5859840," we have to do something like uh str from utf8 i think that's one of the things and we're gonna unwrap this"
5859840,5871680," thing as well uh so what does it say okay uh from utf8 it returns str but we want to have a string"
5871680,5887440," um associated from str bunch of it's std std std str okay and this thing should be mutable"
5891360,5902640," i feel like that is it i feel like that is it basically so i don't freaking know we can we can"
5902640,5912400," test it now uh so let's start the server just a second i need to move to the same folder uh let's start"
5912400,5919120," the server so this again the cargo uh run bean server it's like a bean chilling but being server"
5919120,5925680," uh so honestly oh that's fine so let's do cargo run bin client"
5928160,5932480," okay okay"
5932480,5933440," hi"
5933440,5934800," oh"
5934800,5934960," oh"
5934960,5936960," what the"
5936960,5937200," fuck"
5937200,5943840," um okay that's very interesting so"
5943840,5950480," first fucking try why why was it so fucking easy um just a second"
5951280,5958560," so i need to go back in here so here is the token uh i want to start another cargo run"
5958560,5966560," bean client uh all right so it waits for the token so we can put it in here and uh so let's see"
5966560,5970000," oh yeah it okay"
5972640,5981920," hi hi so and yeah essentially you can type while you do this thing it works right and interestingly"
5981920,5983120," i think it's going to"
5983120,5987040," yeah it's oh that's that's bad"
5987040,5995520," all right so it starts like yeah returning things it's a classical mistake in here it's a classical"
5995520,5998720," mistake that i've already done before i'm glad that i actually checked for that"
5999920,6003360," so stream and wrap all right so we can do n"
6003360,6008880," and what we can do if"
6008880,6016240," no this is right so stream read"
6016240,6027680," if and is greater than zero we're just pushing that otherwise"
6030640,6032560," like this because it's an end of an input"
6032560,6041680," so here's the classical question that i get"
6041680,6047520," let me answer it do you have a video or page where you describe your setup like keyboard layout"
6047520,6055520," emacs key bindings i3 settings no because i am a programming channel and this has nothing to do"
6055520,6059600," with programming that's the first lesson for you"
6059600,6062880," um all right"
6062880,6072080," so what else do we need so let's actually test this kind of stuff uh so this is going to be the server"
6072080,6091680," and um so cargo run bin client okay so now if i kill the server okay so it quits because it reached the end"
6092560,6100240," it reached the end and we have to provide the token so i wonder if copy pasting from the tmux is going to"
6100240,6107440," work it works so i didn't really know how exactly copy pasting in tmux works but i suppose it translates"
6107440,6113520," the characters into a sequence of keys right so it translates into a sequence of keys so i think that"
6113520,6116160," makes sense so welcome to the club buddy"
6116160,6125920," so another interesting thing um is that when your message got rate limited it's still added to your you"
6125920,6132240," see so the messages are added faster than the server logs them look at the how quickly i add them and look"
6132240,6139600," at the how quickly the log of the server moves right so essentially to be fair we don't really even know"
6139600,6146880," uh whether our message got rate limited or not so the server doesn't tell us maybe uh this is something to"
6146880,6157920," um to work on right this is something to work on and uh like extend the protocol so the server can tell"
6157920,6163440," us whether the message was delivered right or the message was actually discarded so you don't add that"
6163440,6172320," message to your own log right to your own log so that's pretty pretty cool i think that's pretty cool"
6172320,6183520," so to be fair i don't really know how well it is going to all work uh we can try to test and do those that"
6185760,6194800," right we can try to test and do that uh and see how it's going to perform uh so first thing we need to"
6194800,6202080," do right the first thing we need to do we'll need to commit all of that right uh ddos ready"
6202080,6215280," uh ddos is ready ddos is ready so yeah let's just go ahead and see yeah so this is the stuff uh"
6215760,6228640," you implement uh the client implement the client uh so it didn't okay implement the client the simple"
6228640,6235120," client right i'm going to push that right into the repo so uh you need to have a rust installed in your"
6235120,6239680," machine right so if we want to be able to use this kind of thing you need to have rust installed in your"
6239680,6246240," machine so here's the source code uh and everything uh right so it's already kind of pushed in there"
6246240,6250960," okay so let's actually ssh to your mom uh all right so let's go ahead and ssh to your mom"
6250960,6261360," so team ux uh i don't have a team ux in here right so so let's go to uh for at all right so this is that"
6261360,6267120," and let's do i have anything so this is the status i'm gonna check um actually reset minus minus heart"
6267120,6277200," uh all right i'm gonna fetch uh prune origin origin master uh it's actually main i keep forgetting right"
6277200,6286000," reflexes git merge origin main okay so let's try to build the entire thing and maybe in release mode"
6286000,6295280," right so we're gonna start with the release mode so that primarily builds the the client right so"
6295280,6298720," we're also building clients on the server which is not particularly neat honestly"
6303600,6312240," but yeah that's fine"
6312240,6320960," oh ip is quite i'm sorry um just a second yeah we need to we need to fix that super quick well i mean"
6320960,6327440," you have a source code just fix it yourself all right so how we're going to be doing all that uh so"
6328800,6334240," it's just building um"
6334240,6342240," why do i have to do everything myself um so where is the source code where is the source code i think"
6342240,6352800," it's in environment right so it's environment args uh right yeah environment orgs use std and uh we can do"
6352800,6363280," something like that so it's gonna let mute args um so how do you do that uh okay so env args so the first"
6363280,6368320," thing we can do we can take a program uh and let's do args next uh expect"
6370960,6376240," um program um program um program is available um program is available um so let's just call the program"
6376240,6391040," program name okay so then we can do if let some um ip right some ip uh args next so you can provide the ip"
6391680,6397760," and uh if ip is provided um we can just return that ip"
6397760,6402800," yeah just return it otherwise we can crash"
6402800,6407200," uh and what can we say we can say eprintln"
6407200,6411600," i'm pretty sure there is an easier way to do that like unwrap or else"
6412640,6414880," yeah unwrap or else let's actually do a proper"
6414880,6420080," uh unwrap or else"
6420080,6422000," all right"
6422000,6432000," can we just unwrap it yeah so since it's a prototype it okay so"
6432000,6440960," just unwrap it right so if we didn't provide it's gonna crash uh so that's fine um so now here"
6441520,6444720," we're gonna do something like ip and it's gonna be format"
6444720,6455680," i'm gonna after the stream after the stream i'm gonna go through all of these things and i'm gonna"
6455680,6461280," fix up all of that stuff okay so we can do expect yeah so uh muhat's suggesting a pretty good a cool"
6461280,6469200," idea right so just say provide ipm i didn't even notice that all right so let's do that"
6471040,6473440," uh provide a pmf sure"
6473440,6483920," uh so we can do it like that so i i swear i promise that after the stream i'm gonna go"
6483920,6487680," through the entire of the source code and i'm gonna replace all these unwraps i swear"
6487680,6491920," this is a temporary solution this is a temporary solution"
6494080,6500400," uh okay so what do we have in here so program is not really used so i think it would make sense to"
6500400,6506400," actually do it like that yes we use the user so let's actually test all of these things locally"
6506400,6515520," right uh so let's do it and this is going to be the server so we do the server and then the clients uh"
6515520,6525600," right so provide a pmf uh right how can i how can i do that uh 27001 boom okay we successfully connected"
6525600,6533600," so then it says who connected and then boom boom uh hi ah yeah so one of the things by the way"
6533600,6542000," by the way there is no editing whatsoever if you up if you up your"
6542000,6547520," message you can't press backspace or anything i'm sorry"
6550560,6556240," okay i can implement one quality of life feature but that means temporary like i literally implemented"
6556240,6561360," this thing in front of your eyes in two hours right without even knowing this library so uh"
6561360,6566960," cut me some slack all right so uh i can add a little bit of the quality of life feature"
6566960,6576000," if you press escape okay if you press escape i can clean up the prompt deal how about that i think"
6576000,6582080," that's the best i can do right now okay right now because implementing proper editing requires like"
6582080,6586640," special things right so it's going to prompt and we're going to clear the prompt on escape"
6586640,6591680," sure so it's sort of like uh disable this into i think so is it something else esc"
6591680,6601120," and boy boy so let's actually test all of that stuff so you up press escape it doesn't send it it"
6601120,6607280," just like it just like cleans it up uh all right so that's pretty cool and yeah invited and it even"
6607280,6612640," closes automatically because it closed it closes the socket so that's actually very useful uh invited"
6612640,6622800," token breath uh so yes yes yes okay let's let me take a look at this thing and uh i'm gonna take"
6622800,6628960," the token let the token put it in here hi that's pretty epic and this comes okay that seems to be cool"
6628960,6641600," so let's actually have this as separate commits um so this one is going to be on hot code the ip and"
6641600,6652640," clean the prompt on escape and i'm gonna push that right into the report all of that stuff is available"
6653120,6658240," all that stuff is available should be available is it available it's it's still pushing right okay"
6658240,6663040," so let's fetch uh the latest stuff uh origin"
6663040,6675600," main okay so and let's do rebuild one more time okay so that was full rebuild i hope"
6676400,6689120," that was the full rebuild uh yes yes yes yes okay go um so i have to actually prepare everything i have to"
6689120,6698320," actually prepare everything so just give me a second give me one goddamn second so this is going to be"
6698320,6704080," a bit sorting uh and this is going to be chat so what i'll have to one it's hat"
6704080,6711440," car to run bin clients and we need to take a look at the ip"
6711440,6714640," ssh config so that's the ip"
6714640,6720000," uh right so that's the ip so i need to have this window sort of like prepared"
6720640,6724880," uh so that i can press the enter and stuff like that"
6724880,6739680," uh so let me let me see so now i'm going to run um i suppose this server chat check the secrets"
6742000,6754320," uh-huh hi oh is it better is the chat experience better now"
6754320,6762640," okay say more things chat please okay so because i need to wipe out the token right thank you so much"
6762640,6770000," okay so hi so okay we have a little bit of new lines in here i do realize that but that's fine"
6770000,6772160," uh we have a little bit of new lines"
6772160,6781840," that's much better right so uh even with new lines even with new lines that's much much better that's so cool"
6781840,6790480," so again it's like rough around the edges right it is rough around the edges i don't understand it i"
6790480,6796320," literally slapped it in two hours using the library that i never seen before but i mean i've seen n cursors"
6796320,6802880," before but uh right so this is so cool isn't it so"
6802880,6814400," okay i'm gonna call it a success i guess i'm gonna call it a success so now we have more or less usable"
6814400,6820240," uh usable client right so that is better than telnet uh that is better than tennis so we can continue"
6820800,6826160," working from there we can continue working from there okay so i'm gonna press ctrl c i'm gonna"
6826160,6835680," press ctrl c and everyone should get disconnected everyone got disconnected hopefully so fine uh that was"
6835680,6843040," actually pretty cool all right and that was pretty cool i guess uh i'm gonna call it a day uh thanks"
6843040,6849200," everyone who's watching me right now i really appreciate it have a good one and i see you all"
6849200,6855440," on next recreational programming session with azuzin love you all"
