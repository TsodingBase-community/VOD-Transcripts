0,5360," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session"
5360,12000," let's make a little bit of announcement and officially start the stream as usual as usual"
12000,20160," uh let's do red circle uh live on twitch and what are we doing today on twitch dot a television"
20160,26800," website today we are doing uh live on gpu that's what we're doing today so i'm gonna give the link"
26800,32480," to https twitch.tv sorting the place where we're doing all that and i'm gonna ping everyone who's"
32480,37280," interested in being pinged and there we go the stream has officially started so today we're going"
37280,43840," to continue working on uh implementing this paper which is the generalization of the conveys game of"
43840,49920," life uh as you probably know conveys game of life is a cellular automaton but it's very discreet thing"
49920,57520," so this paper uh is trying to make a smooth generalization right on a continuous space"
57520,63360," instead of a discrete one and it actually succeeds doing so so the the goal of this paper was to find"
63360,69920," the omnidirectional glider uh as far as you can tell right so and they found it so in a continuous domain"
69920,75840," the glider looks like this believe it or not right so that's how it looks like uh right and on the"
75840,83200," the previous stream we implemented um this cell automaton uh in the terminal right so we implemented"
83200,87600," like a very simple terminal renderer and it kind of worked so let's actually take a look at how it"
87600,94080," looks like uh i'm going to just rebuild everything just in case and if we start up this entire thing"
94080,99600," this is how it looks like so it's a continuous game of life right as you can see it's not like very"
99600,104640," discrete it's very uh sort of like smooth and that's why it's called smooth life by the way so"
104640,110000," this is actually a very stable pattern what the fuck usually the pattern just like spreads out and"
110000,115600," just finds the stable state this one actually goes for for quite some time so we yeah so usually what it"
115600,121840," does it just like goes into this very stable state and just stays there for as long as possible for but"
121840,127120," for quite some time it may actually just like wander around sometimes it may die out completely right"
127120,133120," sometimes it may die out uh right so and but quite often it just like does these kind of things and"
133120,137600," it's actually really cool as you can see all of that in in terminal right so all of that in terminal"
137600,146080," right and all of that is on cpu uh but what i want you to do actually as an ultimate goal is to try"
146080,152960," doing that thing on gpu and here's the question how would you even do something like that on gpu"
152960,158080," right so to understand how you can do that on gpu you need to understand how we even compute"
158080,164880," uh the next state of this cellular automaton right so it's kind of like similar to how we do that with"
164880,172240," the conveys game of life right so essentially for each cell we are uh considering the neighborhood of"
172240,179440," that cell uh right so let me actually study my paint right and based on the state of the neighborhood we"
179440,186560," decide whether we want to switch to a dead state or a live state so in uh case of the smooth game of"
186560,192000," life right so imagine that this is the sort of like a continuous grid uh right so we have the current"
192000,199200," point right and the state of the point is not zero and one or one it's rather from zero to one so what we"
199200,206240," do we consider the uh neighborhood of a certain radius right and another neighborhood of a bigger"
206240,211920," radius right so we essentially consider the states of the cell within like inner circle and within the"
211920,218480," outer circle and we have a smooth continuous functions that when given the values based on these two"
218480,225040," neighborhoods gives you the rate at which the state of this point has to change right it's like conveys game"
225040,230320," of life but it's continuous and smooth right instead of like switching between the states so that's"
230320,236720," basically what it is right and how can you simulate all of that on gpu well uh you can do a very"
236720,243120," interesting thing you can essentially store the state of the cellular automaton in a texture in a"
243120,246160," for instance if we're going to be doing opengl and we're going to be doing opengl"
246880,252160," we can store the state uh in the opengl texture right so each pixel of the texture represents like"
252160,258880," the value uh of the um the state of the pixel right and the next thing we can do we can come up with a"
258880,266880," fragment shader that uh basically given the texture uh renders the next state of this entire stuff so when"
266880,273680," the fragment shader actually basically works on the level of pixels so it's a single program that works on a"
273680,280720," single pixel uh of the screen right so and uh what it will do it will basically take the texture take"
280720,287680," at the neighborhood and then compute the next pixel right and in opengl there is such thing as frame"
287680,295360," buffer of screen rendering so essentially you can render not on the screen but into another texture"
295360,303360," right so essentially you can have a shader right so we can have a shader uh right that given a texture"
303360,311520," will basically compute uh you the next state as another texture right and all of that can happen"
311520,316800," within a single draw call right within a single draw call uh you just give it a texture and then it"
316800,322880," computes the next texture right and so what you can do essentially on the next draw call you can swap these"
322880,328560," textures around and repeat that process right so essentially with a single shader that computer for"
328560,333520," giving the texture computes the next texture you can keep like feeding it into itself and it will keep"
333520,340480," computing uh the next state of the cellular automaton on each draw call right so at least that's the"
340480,345360," theory at least that's the theory i'm not sure if it's going to work out in the practice but as far as"
345360,351360," now people uh has done it like that on uh like shader toy and stuff like that and it kind of works"
351360,356240," uh right but uh i never implemented that myself and i really want to implement that myself just to"
356240,361200," understand how you can do this kind of stuff and it's actually kind of cool right because each pixel"
361200,367040," can be uh competed independently so and if you manage to put that on gpu it's going to be extremely"
367040,373200," parallel so that means in theory it's going to be super fast and extremely smooth right so imagine like"
373200,378960," simulating this entire i think at 60 fps like very very smoothly uh that would be an extra kind of cool"
378960,385520," i think right that would have been actually kind of cool so what we're going to use for uh for for"
385520,390560," doing all of that right so obviously as i already said that we're going to use opengl but um what i"
390560,398240," learned is that uh the library that we use for visualization of the neural networks right array leap"
398880,405840," actually uh supports custom shaders right so you can not only draw like primitives like circles and"
405840,411280," rectangles you can actually customize the shaders with which they can be pre-processed or post-processed"
411280,417600," and stuff like that and it also supports the frame buffer off-screen rendering so it supports a special"
417600,424880," kind of texture into which you can render scenes right so essentially you can render scene by just"
424880,429200," rendering it and then you can switch the mode and it's going to render the scene into a separate"
429200,434480," texture that that you can then use to render something else right basically frame buffers"
434480,440800," right so it essentially supports uh it's built on top of opengl but it actually exposes all of the"
440800,447840," necessary mechanisms of opengl that we might want to use in this sort of simulation right so which makes"
447840,453840," it actually perfect candidate to to use for for this project right i could have used sdl but sdl when"
453840,460160," it comes to this kind of stuff it basically serves as a glorified opengl initializer and nothing else"
460160,465600," and if you need opengl initializer it would be better to use something like glfw uh right so"
465600,472960," using sdl as an opengl initializer is kind of an overkill in my opinion right uh of course it has"
472960,478080," more stuff for input output and sound and stuff like that but if you just need opengl initialization"
478080,483360," it's kind of overkill in my opinion really upon the other hand it actually gives you a lot of"
483360,490000," convenient stuff it uh initializes a lot of things and exposes quite a quite a few mechanisms of opengl"
490000,495760," that sdl doesn't expose right so and uh that's what we're gonna be doing today that's what we're gonna"
495760,503040," be using today all right so uh we'll get some subs while i was doing the intro uh thank you so much"
503040,510080," everyone who just supped so uh we got a donkey brains i thank you so much for the time it was three"
510080,515520," hours ago but i still want to acknowledge that uh philippi v2 i hope i pronounced your nickname correctly"
515520,520800," thank you so much for tier one and lamexis i also hope i pronounced your nickname correctly thank you"
520800,527520," so much for twitch prime thank you thank you thank you all right uh let's say go let's try to implement"
527520,535200," uh smooth live on gpu right so uh i don't really want to remove the existing application in here right"
535200,539600," so i want to create another one that uses ray leap rendering so maybe because of that i'm going to kind"
539600,544240," of rename uh this entire thing to something else let's actually call it something like smooth live"
544880,551680," uh term right so because it's a terminal it uses terminal rendering uh right and in here"
551680,559280," uh we probably want to do something like a smooth uh life term there we go so if i uh redo this and"
559280,564320," i think it seems to be working okay so another thing uh we're going to do i'm going to comment out"
564320,571200," the previous one right and uh we're going to have something like smooth live uh gpu right so this is a"
571200,578960," smooth life on gpu so let's go ahead and create such things smooth the life gpu dot c uh right and i'm"
578960,586800," going to include stdio and let's create an entry point right and here what we're going to do we're going"
586800,597040," to just print hello world hello seaman right so let's put exclamation mark and uh let's try to build that"
597040,603440," thing as well and it seems to be working and let's try to run this entire stuff uh gpu there we go"
603440,609600," so let's do the first thing that we usually do write a simple border plate for ray deep uh let's include"
609600,615840," ray deep super quick so very deep and if i remember correctly uh to initialize the window you have like"
615840,622960," init window uh function i mean i can just look it up in the in the source code of ray deep itself right so"
622960,628880," there's no need to guess anything i can just look up in it window uh just a second let me quickly put"
628880,635200," something behind my camera i keep forgetting about that for some reason just a sec just a sec good to do this"
635200,645760," uh yes yes yes yes so emit uh window in it window so here it is so here what we have to specify uh we"
645760,651920," have to specify width and height and uh the title right so let's actually put something like smooth life"
651920,658960," in here uh smooth life and uh let's also provide screen width and screen height so we're gonna have screen"
658960,670000," width uh 800 and screen height which is gonna be 600 so this is gonna be screen width and this is gonna be"
670000,677120," screen uh height there we go we initialize this entire thing so uh if i remember correctly right you"
677120,685120," also have to set the fps you have to lock your fps set a render or something something fps i don't quite"
685120,693200," remember yes set target fps right so uh we're gonna put 60 fps because i mean it's 2023 i think we can"
693200,701600," afford uh having 60 fps per second frames fps per second uh right i think uh it is actually quite"
701600,709600," affordable these days okay so and after that that is basically this is the entire initialization of the"
709600,714480," library right so the entire initializations the only thing you need to do you need to organize the event"
714480,720880," loop right so as far as i know for that there there was a function should yeah window should close it"
720880,728880," basically i presume flashes all of the uh events all of the input events and stuff like that every handles"
728880,733840," everything and um stuff like that and then answers the question whether the window should close soon"
734320,741360," uh right and while the windows the window is should not close yet we're going to keep processing those"
741360,746640," things and how we're going to be processing that we can just render something begin uh drawing we start"
746640,753840," drawing here we can clear the background with let's say a red color i want something bright so it's"
753840,759920," instantly visible that we are doing something on the screen and then we just end the drawing and that is it"
759920,766160," this is the entire boilerplate of raylib right so that's why it's so freaking cool right"
766160,773760," or every function call just like makes sense and there's nothing uh you know there's no redundancy in"
773760,778480," here that's that's basically what you want to have in here yes uh right so and of course"
778480,783280," it's not going to work because it cannot find relief this library does not exist i just made it up"
787440,792800," this magical library that was talking about it doesn't exist it's fake i just made that up it"
792800,799520," things cannot be that good in 2023 if you want to put something on the screen in 2023 you have to"
799520,805840," fucking suffer i'm actually joking so uh we just need to set up some things some flags specifically"
805840,813680," uh right so uh right we're gonna use package config all right so essentially uh it's gonna be package"
813680,819280," config and we're gonna use ray deep and basically asking give us the flags that we need to pass to"
819280,825920," the compiler for uh ray leap to work right so these uh these are the flags right these are the flags"
825920,831600," and uh also we can ask for the libraries to link with right so this is going to be lips"
831600,838000," uh all right so and let's try to recompile it still doesn't work because it cannot find the package config"
838000,844400," configuration package configuration so we have to set up the environment properly so i have a ray deep"
844400,850560," environment somewhere here and that should finally work as you can see it compiled but it didn't freaking"
850560,857280," link it didn't freaking link i think you should also put close window yeah i also think so but i wonder if um"
857280,865520," if the application just exits it uh will just work right well we'll see uh all right so as you can see it also"
865520,871520," wants to link with things that start with dl things like deal open deal close deal scene and as far as"
871520,879840," i know these uh names are available in uh library dl so we can link link with ldl right so another thing"
879840,886160," it wants to have it wants to have glfw uh surprisingly okay so let's link that with the glfw"
886160,893200," uh right let's use the glfw for initialization and the last thing it wants is pthreats right so let's"
893200,899120," provide pthreats as well and there you go it's as easy as that as easy as that and when i close it"
899120,904160," everything's fine as you can see i didn't really even have to uh like call close window because it"
904160,911360," works without it right but to maybe keep things clean we can try to do that close window here it is"
911360,917760," so maybe maybe this is something that we have to call at the end of the application even though as we observed"
917760,922960," it doesn't really make much difference i suppose it just cleans things up maybe delegates some memory"
922960,927760," and stuff like that but as you as you know in the modern operating system operating system just cleans"
927760,933600," up everything up to you uh unless it's trying to do something that uh operating system is not aware of"
933600,939520," maybe it needs to modify something on the hard drive or something i don't know right uh so but"
939520,947840," let's let's have a close window here just in case there we go pretty cool pretty a freaking uh cool so"
947840,952800," now we need to work with textures right so now we need to work with textures so if i remember correctly"
952800,961280," how do we even create and render the texture so let me find let's actually try to render a texture on the"
961280,967600," screen right so let's just try to render texture on the screen uh let's not go too crazy very quickly"
967600,973680," right so texture as far as now there is a draw texture yeah there we go so there is a draw texture"
973680,981360," so it accepts texture 2d so we need to construct texture 2d somehow uh right let's try to find how we"
981360,987200," can do that so here's the texture 2d nothing particularly interesting for us um oh yeah this one is very"
987200,993920," interesting so it has a special kind of texture called render texture 2d right so it just has a"
993920,1001360," texture 2d and render texture 2d so the thing about render texture 2d is that it's the texture into which"
1001360,1009120," you can render things it's a render target right so and this is the like a perfect candidate for our case"
1009120,1015440," right so essentially if we store this state in a texture we compute the next state into another texture"
1015440,1021360," into the render target right that that we can then use for the next sort of iteration and the next"
1021360,1024960," iteration and the next iteration uh right"
1024960,1036400," so uh let me uh let me see but we're not gonna go into that yet texture 2d"
1037360,1043840," so uh let's find load texture right so you can actually load texture from a file uh but this is"
1043840,1049280," not really what i want because i want to be able to actually initialize the pixels myself right so"
1049280,1054160," the thing that we're probably going to use we're going to use texture from image right so an image"
1054160,1063120," is like a texture but on cpu right if i'm not mistaken so load texture so this is the texture but uh"
1063120,1068880," where can we get an image right where can we get an image that's a very interesting question"
1068880,1075600," where can we get an image so as far as i know uh there was something like load image uh right so you"
1075600,1080800," can load image from the file but this is not what we want and also if i remember correctly you could"
1080800,1086720," generate some yeah you could generate an image right so you can generate like a solid color thing and also"
1086720,1091040," it allows you to generate some patterns right so that's actually kind of cool right so you can"
1091040,1096080," generate some part uh you can generate the purlin noise is that how we pronounce that purlin noise uh"
1096080,1101520," purlin purlin i think that's that's how we pronounce that uh let's try to generate some purlin noise uh"
1101520,1106400," this is actually super convenient so what's going to be the size of the texture so so i think the size"
1106400,1110560," of the texture is going to be the size of the window right so because the size of the window is going"
1110560,1117520," to be the uh you know the whole area within which we're simulating the uh the smooth game of life"
1117520,1123280," right so that makes sense in my opinion so this is a screen uh width and screen height so i have"
1123280,1129600," no idea what is offset x and offset y uh as far as no purlin noise is just like an infinite plane"
1129600,1135920," and i suppose that's basically the offset within that plane so i suppose i can put just zero in here"
1135920,1140640," and i don't know what is a scale but since scale is usually something you multiply by"
1140640,1145280," just in case i want to put a one in here so it does not multiplication does not end up with zero"
1145280,1149840," or something like that right so this is purely my intuition right i'm going off of the intuition i"
1149840,1156400," don't really know what exactly all these parameters mean welcome to software development by the way"
1156400,1163200," welcome to software development okay so we have some texture can i just draw the texture draw"
1163200,1169200," texture yeah i can draw the texture so let's actually put it somewhere uh right so here we're"
1169200,1176000," cleaning up with uh the clean stuff so maybe i'm gonna put black in here right so then i'm gonna put"
1176000,1182240," the texture in here we're gonna render it at zero and tint is gonna be white so as far as i know tint is"
1182240,1190560," just like adds additional like color component to to the whole texture tint it just adds the tint to the"
1190560,1194480," texture right so in our case like we put white so that means there will be no tint it's going to be"
1194480,1200400," original color of the texture if i understood correctly right so uh let's try to to run this"
1200400,1206000," into i think let me see if it's gonna there we go that's apparently nice right it may look like clouds"
1206000,1214160," and yes pearly noise quite often used to simulate clouds right quite often uh also it's i i heard it's also"
1214160,1223040," used for generating uh terrains right as far as no uh minecraft uses or at least used to use perlin noise"
1223040,1227360," for generating terrains and stuff like that maybe it still uses because like what do you replace it with"
1227360,1232400," uh right so let's actually play with different parameters in here so what if i make it"
1232400,1238240," like bigger what if i make five in here so i suppose it's going to be more dense so i presume it just like"
1238240,1243360," sort of zooms out maybe uh or maybe it's going to zoom in sometimes it's kind of difficult to tell"
1243360,1248560," what exactly this entity i think is going to no it's zoomed out uh right it kind of zoomed out so it"
1248560,1256080," made it a little bit more dense uh we can take a look at some other um patterns in here right so generate"
1256080,1267360," perlin uh again image so there's a white noise uh cellular generate seller algorithm oh this one is"
1267360,1277440," interesting okay so what is this thingy majinguy uh so we can provide a screen width so screen width"
1277440,1285120," and screen height and um tile size let's actually set the tile size is going to be maybe sixth of the width"
1285680,1291120," or something like that i don't know if it's go is that a word it's a it's a war night diagram"
1291120,1299520," yo it's actually cool all right what if i make it smaller right it's a selection to make it small yeah"
1299520,1302160," it gives me tripo phobia to be fair what the"
1302160,1307840," race and what the why do you have tripo phobia in your library"
1312720,1318880," um all right so so let's actually use perlin noise i think perrin this is a little bit better"
1318880,1327840," so this one is actually kind of cool because we can use this already as the initial state of the"
1327840,1333280," smooth life right because yeah that's that's the perfect state uh so maybe we can take a look at the"
1333280,1341440," like white noise right so let's take a look at why noise uh so because i remember seeing the white noise in"
1341440,1348880," here uh so i don't know what is the factor but i'm gonna just set it to one uh right"
1348880,1360160," screen width and uh screen height there we go so let me see and that's well i mean it's white but is it"
1360160,1369680," really noise uh maybe we need to increase the value of the center i think no what about 10"
1369680,1378480," maybe it has to be like less than less than one is that what you want oh yeah it wants less than okay so"
1378480,1386000," it just wanted it less than one okay sure uh all right so the bigger the value the dense it becomes i"
1386000,1392320," suppose uh right so and uh this also could be like initial state as far as i know it is recommended to"
1392320,1397120," initialize the board with the white noise i'm really apologize for the encoding right now the"
1397120,1401840," encoding is probably horrible because of white noise right it is really recommended to initialize"
1401840,1408000," smooth life with just a random state uh right but has anyone uh tried like a permanent noise i think"
1408000,1413280," permanent noise is a way better way of initializing this stuff it also takes some time to initialize"
1413280,1418560," so there is initial delay yeah you can clearly see the initial delay before it like generated this thing"
1418560,1423680," uh yeah it causes strange encoding yeah this is because it's a white noise it's it's pretty normal for"
1423680,1430720," encoders to freak out when there's a lot of small little details i don't really know how encoders work"
1430720,1438960," but i assume that they essentially send a lot of uh deltas of the image right so they never like"
1438960,1443440," send over the network the whole image because that's a lot of information they probably sent"
1443440,1450000," deltas right uh and also a compression algorithm okay so maybe it's bad for the compression algorithm so i"
1450000,1456560," thought maybe like a lot of small changes like causes a lot of change on the screen or something"
1456560,1460400," like that but if it's a compression algorithm actually the problem with compression algorithm"
1460400,1465360," makes a lot of sense because if there's a lot of noise it's kind of difficult to compress so it just like"
1465360,1471760," drops down the quality or something i don't know so maybe i should learn about encoders right so we've"
1471760,1477600," got some subs thank you so much copper case it for uh tier one subscription 45 month of tier one"
1477600,1483600," subscription with the message sodden weber hello sodding and chat hello hello thank you so much for"
1483600,1491280," the sub thank you so much for this up all right so can we write a shader that has an access to this"
1491280,1496880," entire thing so that's an interesting question right so we can draw a texture but how can we customize a"
1496880,1504240," shader that renders that texture because obviously raylieb probably used some sort of a shader to render this"
1504240,1510720," structure in opengl you can't render shit without the shader right so we need to be able to customize"
1510720,1517520," that so as far as i know in raylieb uh you can uh literally create the shader so there are shaders yeah"
1517520,1522720," so here is the structure uh i wonder if there's some there's something like load shader yeah there we go"
1523440,1529120," so and you have to load vertex and fragment shader is that really necessary"
1529120,1537760," man like i don't really care about vertex shader can i tell this entire thing is just like use the"
1537760,1544160," default vertex shader and just like i'm going to replace only the fragment shader you know what"
1544160,1547600," as far as i know this thing has a lot of examples so let's take a look at the examples"
1549520,1556000," so uh here are the examples there's a ton of them right android and web wait a second"
1556000,1559280," this thing works on android and web"
1559280,1566880," so that means i can take whatever i developed for neural network visualization"
1566880,1569440," and port it to the browsers for everyone to play"
1569440,1581040," that's actually perfect topic for the next stream question mark yo right so the thing that we have in"
1581040,1586960," neural networks in here so an end of age right so the ui that allows you to train and stuff like that"
1586960,1591600," if we manage to port that thing to web that would be perfect for promotion and stuff like that because"
1591600,1596800," it's super easy to give to people look guys this is what i'm doing and they can instantly just play"
1596800,1601360," with this thing and they just they can just see that you can just like train this stuff it's just"
1601360,1607360," like actually i should give it a try right so maybe the the next stream on neural networks is going"
1607360,1612960," to be actually porting this to web uh right so people can play with this thing on the web without"
1612960,1619920," trying to build it that's perfect actually what the fuck and since the nm.h is such a simple library"
1619920,1626560," i don't see any reason for nm.h to actually not work in web assembly right because it depends a"
1626560,1634320," little bit on uh libc but not too much yo that would be perfect anyway so but that's not the topic of"
1634320,1641040," today's stream uh all right so uh let's go so i want you to take a look at the examples right so i want"
1641040,1645920," you to take a look at the examples and let's actually literally grab uh does anyone use load"
1645920,1657760," shader right load shader uh okay so so only one i suppose maybe we have to do shaders uh yeah it was a"
1657760,1669520," shader that's weird so there is a version oh okay so i'm looking it accepts only one parameter but uh"
1669520,1675200," it they just split it on their own two separate lines okay um oh look at that okay so this is"
1675200,1681040," actually kind of cool so you basically you don't have to provide uh both of the shaders okay so that's"
1681040,1685680," actually kind of cool i can only provide the uh the fragment shaders and stuff like that that's actually"
1685680,1694720," kind of cool uh all right so i want them for the textures do we have some shaders in here uh right"
1694720,1699600," so let me take a look okay so when we're talking about shaders the textures they don't really do"
1699600,1709840," anything what if we go into the shaders and search for load texture uh okay so let me see custom uh shader"
1709840,1717360," shapes okay this one is interesting so you're loading a thing okay this is this is precisely what i want this"
1717360,1722880," is actually our case so here we're loading the texture and then we are loading a shader that is"
1722880,1729200," only fragment shader right the only fragment shader so i suppose it just modifies the texture uh okay so"
1729200,1737120," oh this is actually kind of cool oh yeah so essentially we sup they supply different shaders for different"
1737120,1745840," merchants of versions of jlsl right so in resources uh in resources they have uh shaders and yeah so as"
1745840,1751440," you can see there's like three folders in here and depending on the macro that we have in here it's"
1751440,1755760," going to be how this macro is even decided this is actually a very interesting question right"
1755760,1764400," let's take a look at the really how is it defined i decided jlsl it's probably located in rljl uh no"
1766240,1777440," version okay so it's not even okay grab jlsl version so it's probably coming from the opengl right"
1777440,1783200," so from the opengl headers so that's probably where it's coming from uh or maybe it's defined in the"
1783200,1792480," examples themselves is it defining it is defined an example themselves and ooh yo so if the platform is"
1792480,1800640," desktop on a desktop it uses the 3.3 on the rpi so i suppose it's a raspberry pi android and web"
1800640,1810480," this is the nerdiest i've ever seen yo what the this is so cool right so"
1810480,1816880," all of the platforms the nerds will like basically port their stuff to so cool"
1817760,1822000," unfortunately i don't really have rpi right it would be kind of nice to have raspberry pi but"
1822000,1823360," i'm too poor for this kind of shit"
1823360,1832160," so uh all right so i suppose we're going to be using the version 3.3 right so that kind of makes sense"
1832160,1839200," uh okay and let me take a look at the shader itself right so um let me take a look at the shader"
1842800,1848240," so that means you need multiple shaders i guess we can't implement that i guess that's basically"
1848240,1852320," unsolved computer science problem it's impossible to have several shaders for different platforms it's"
1852320,1859040," just like i guess we have to give up only multi-billion corporation company can afford such a complicated"
1859040,1867120," project uh okay so let's take a look at this thing and uh gray scale uh okay so this is what we have in here"
1868400,1876240," uh gl sl mode so input vertex attributes from the vertex shaders so it gives you frag text"
1876240,1883760," coordinate i suppose this is the coordinate of the texture right so um and it's probably specific"
1883760,1891600," to the default vertex shader right and this is the input frag color uh we can also have the uniform textures"
1891600,1898000," and i suppose uh i wonder if all of that stuff is just like hard coded right so this is also called"
1898000,1905680," diffuse uh an output color so this is where we compute the output color too and frag text chord is"
1905680,1911120," actually already normalized so it's already normalized because we are directly feeding it into the texture"
1911120,1919600," function uh all right okay so and frag color like having frag color is actually very useful because"
1919600,1925360," it's the current color of the of the fragment thing here right so that well not really it could be the"
1925360,1932240," core it could be the tint actually this mother flipper could be the tint yo we'll need to double"
1932240,1937760," check that right so and there's a like different conversions in here but i mean aneriki okay so this"
1937760,1943200," is actually perfect this is exactly what i wanted okay so let's go ahead and create our own shader"
1943840,1949920," so smooth uh life and it's going to be a fragment shader so it's going to be fs uh version i'm going to"
1949920,1960720," actually um so jlsl mode so 330 and i'm going to start copy pasting the code uh from here so i suppose"
1960720,1967200," i'm going to literally copy paste all of these things in here right so i i presume this is the stuff that's"
1967200,1974560," coming from the library itself right so the library itself supplies all these inputs and uniforms and"
1974560,1979680," outputs are expected to be like that so i better just copy paste this stuff like as it is right"
1979680,1985680," so and then uh let's actually do the following thing right let's do the following thing"
1987680,1994640," uh here i'm gonna take the final color right so here we just like modify the uh the stuff and we"
1994640,2000400," set the final color but i'm gonna do the outrageous thing i'm gonna set the final color to let's say"
2000400,2006640," green right so something really bright that we didn't use before right so before we use the red"
2006640,2010800," but now i'm going to set it to green so no matter what kind of texture we have in here is going to be"
2010800,2016960," always green and that means we kind of control this entire thing right uh okay and that's basically the"
2017680,2025920," shader right so uh let me go to gpu and let's try to load that shader right so a load shader uh let"
2025920,2033360," me go to ray lip in here uh load shader uh and i'm gonna like literally paste it in here i think because"
2033360,2039520," i want to have the the actual signature right so this is our shader uh we're not gonna provide the"
2039520,2045760," vertex shader we don't really care about the vertex shader uh in today's project at least uh and in here"
2045760,2053280," we're gonna supply smooth live dot fs and that should just work so the question is how do we"
2053280,2063840," even use such shader right so uh shader shapes texture right so shader okay so you have to use"
2063840,2070320," begin shader mode that makes sense actually that's actually kind of cool so you begin drawing you draw"
2070320,2075680," some stuff and then you want to switch the current shader you begin the shader mode you render within"
2075680,2079760," that shader mode and you end it you can actually have like a several shaders right and you can switch"
2079760,2086400," between them um and stuff like that so that's kind of cool uh that's precisely what i'm gonna do so"
2086400,2095360," all right can i do something something like this one two three four and then uh begin shader mode just use"
2095360,2101600," this shader render the texture uh with that specific shader and we're gonna end the shader mode"
2101600,2106800," shader mode and let's see if it's gonna it's gonna work if everything went according to the plan we're"
2106800,2112880," gonna see the green screen just like the entire screen is supposed to be green uh let's go ahead and do that"
2113520,2121280," so can i can do that it didn't work the way i expected this entire thing to work so that's kind of"
2121280,2128480," weird so something went wrong so i can i can already see the the warnings in here uh failed to compile the"
2128480,2133840," fragment shader okay so that's actually kind of cool too many parameters for vector two all right so"
2135040,2142240," so it's 16 it it has to be back to four of course thank you so much and um so it worked"
2142240,2151280," it actually worked so we can take the color green and we can essentially take the texture right texture"
2151280,2157920," texture texture zero and we can multiply it by the current like pixel right so this is the fragment"
2157920,2162080," uh texture color right so and that means it's going to be permanent noise but it's going to be"
2162080,2166080," greenish permanent noise if you know what i mean right so it's going to be more of a greenish one"
2166080,2172880," now uh and it's a it's a greenish permanent noise right so we have custom shaders um we have custom"
2172880,2178160," shaders this is some useful error messages as far as i know they're coming from the opengl itself right"
2178160,2186320," it's not like uh ray leap shows them ray leap just uh basically proxies whatever opengl told it right so"
2186320,2191920," yeah so it's more of a like i suppose achievement of messa but i mean ray leap is also"
2191920,2199760," pretty cool as well uh right so and i'm i'm wondering what is a frack color right so what"
2199760,2206720," if i just say okay the final color is the frack color if i understand correctly this might be the"
2206720,2212160," tint this might be the tint so that means if i just do something like that it's gonna be completely white"
2212160,2219680," right because i set the tint to be white uh yep i was right so i can modify that specific thing in here"
2220320,2224560," from here so let's actually set it to blue so this is the color that we never used before before we used"
2224560,2231440," red green and now blue just to distinguish right uh so different stuff that there we go so that's a"
2231440,2237440," very interesting blue i don't think it's a pure blue uh i suppose it's a really blue right so"
2238880,2248720," uh okay so if i go to ray leap uh let me find defined blue yeah it's not a pure blue look it's just so funny"
2248720,2260240," i remember like somebody commented on the on a youtube video about ray leap is that everyone is trying to"
2260240,2264480," to have like a prefix to not pollute the uh to not pollute the uh to not pollute the namespace"
2264480,2267840," and chad really being like define red"
2267840,2275520," fuck your namespaces fuck your namespaces define red you don't need that name this is my name"
2275520,2280320," right why would you need that name for like i mean you're obviously using ray leap so you're"
2280320,2285840," obviously gonna only define this as the color red for ray leap obviously so"
2285840,2292960," right this is how chad libraries define their names"
2293840,2302640," none of that virgin prefixes namespaces define red you don't need other libraries that's it you don't"
2302640,2311120," need that all right oh to be fair that's a good point you can actually undefine it right so i didn't"
2311120,2316000," think about that so for things like that yeah i suppose it makes sense because at any point you"
2316000,2321120," can just undefine it and it's not that critical so yeah i see i'm actually joking i'm like i don't"
2321120,2326400," i don't consider that to be like an actual criticism or like showstopper to use this library i just find"
2326400,2330000," it funny a little bit uh right"
2330000,2338320," really be like they space your own code yeah exactly"
2338320,2347680," it's not the ray leap who needs to namespace their names it's you right all right"
2350640,2360000," uh okay so let's continue so we have at least a kind of stuff and it seems to be working it seems"
2360000,2367440," to be twerking so we can already try to port this entire thing to yeah that's like everything but"
2367440,2376240," we need to be able to i guess um render things um into into render texture right so we'll need to"
2376800,2385840," compute the next state somewhere right so let me see how do you define uh render texture 2d right so can"
2385840,2395600," you just do uh okay load render texture so you can load this thing from just width you can allocate some"
2395600,2403600," width in here uh load render texture uh load render texture is that is that it"
2403600,2411360," but what if i want to construct uh render texture out of this texture how do you even do that"
2411360,2420320," um so that's that's really strange uh okay so let me take a look at the definition of this thing"
2420960,2427280," uh where was the definition okay so it's a type def for render texture okay sure and within this thing"
2427280,2437360," it has two textures and the texture uh it's actually okay so the texture and texture 2d are the same thing"
2437360,2445440," why oh this okay maybe this is some sort of like a backward compatibility thing i don't know why but"
2445440,2452400," texture 2d and texture is the same thing as well as render texture to the render texture okay sure um so"
2452400,2465760," i suppose so there's also depth buffer attached to it that's kind of cool so yeah if we can access the"
2465760,2474400," texture huh one of the things we can do can we create a render texture right so let me try to do that so"
2474400,2482240," render texture uh load around the textures there is no such thing like as load render texture from image"
2482240,2488240," let me double check that i'm going to try to compile uh yeah there is no such thing so we can also only"
2488240,2495360," load around the texture by its size right so we can only just pre-allocate it but now we need to somehow"
2495360,2503360," get the pixels of the render texture into pixels of this image into this render texture somehow so this is a"
2503360,2512560," a really weird uh api not gonna lie so and i suppose the way we can do that so here i can just access the"
2512560,2522320," original picture uh again texture huh i mean that's fine if i take a look at the smooth lifefs so let me just go back"
2522320,2532320," so this entire thing has to be black yeah okay so uh i suppose since this is a render texture but i still can't access the"
2532320,2539840," access the the texture like a raw texture to d i should be able to use something like maybe uh update"
2539840,2546960," texture right yeah update texture uh which i can provide to which i can provide the pixels i can actually"
2546960,2553520," do something like that yeah there we go uh that's a really weird way of doing that but i mean then you can just"
2553520,2558560," use image data uh so that should work out and it were okay so"
2558560,2565360," it's a really weird hoops that you get have to go through it would be kind of nice if like you"
2565360,2570720," have the same interface for working with render textures as you have with just textures all right"
2570720,2577840," but i mean that works out too i mean why not it's just like a little bit weird um okay so we can think about"
2577840,2587360," this thing as sort of like a state zero right so this is a regional state uh of the like initial state"
2587360,2592320," of the of the game right so this is the initial state of the game and then we can have something like"
2592320,2599840," state one and state one is basically the state into which we are rendering this entire thing right so into which we are rendering this entire thing"
2599840,2613040," so uh let me let me see so as far as i know we you have to do begin texture yeah begin texture mode right"
2613040,2617360," so as you can see here you provide the texture so essentially you have to provide the texture here"
2617360,2623680," into which you want to render uh let me take a look at some examples uh that maybe explain how you use this"
2623680,2630560," entire thing right so do we have anything in here uh fog of war there's literally an example called"
2630560,2638080," fog of war this is actually pretty cool right so you start rendering and you just literally render it as"
2638080,2642800," you would render anything but it's not going to be displayed it's going to be uh basically rendered"
2642800,2649360," into this texture and then uh you can just render this texture on top of something for instance so this"
2649360,2653840," is actually very cool this is precisely what we what we want right so you can have basically two"
2653840,2659760," stage rendering right so we can render one thing into the texture and then use that texture to render"
2659760,2664240," something else and as far as i can understand you can have like several sort of steps of rendering"
2664240,2669360," through this like frame buffers and render textures and stuff like that so here is the first phase where"
2669360,2675200," this example i suppose generates fog of war right and then that generated fog of war is used in the main"
2675200,2682000," rendering that is going to be displayed and that's literally our case right so in here uh right so"
2682000,2688640," where's the gpu uh so here's the actual rendering but maybe we want to actually render state one"
2688640,2696480," right and oh we want to do something like begin uh texture mode uh and we render into state one"
2696480,2703680," right so and then and texture mode uh and what we're going to be doing in here i suppose we're going to be"
2703680,2706720," cleaning everything up right so we're cleaning everything up right so we're cleaning everything up"
2706720,2716320," and we're rendering the previous texture yeah so as you can see here we're rendering state zero"
2716320,2722400," into state one right and then we're rendering state one onto the screen"
2722400,2730240," right so and then then the next thing we can do we can swap those texture around somehow i don't really"
2730240,2736240," know how we can swap them uh are they like very you know heavy structures i don't think they're very"
2736240,2741840," heavy structures uh right so this is the entire structure it contains another structure which is"
2741840,2746000," texture which is just a bunch of numbers so i should be able to literally like copy them"
2746000,2756800," uh right can we do something like that uh state zero right so then i can replace state zero with state one"
2756800,2758560," and then state one with t"
2758560,2769200," so like i directly describe what i wanted to describe right so essentially we don't have it okay so for"
2769200,2775520," this one by the way we don't need the shader actually right since we just want to display the texture"
2775520,2780320," we don't need the shader yeah so the shaders need to to compute the next thing"
2781520,2783520," yo okay so that makes sense"
2783520,2791760," so that's the whole logic right so that's the whole logic so does it make sense i think it makes sense"
2791760,2798640," that's actually kind of cool how is it going to work actually uh so let's not swap things around let's"
2798640,2806160," not swap things around i wonder how it is going to just like do things uh let me see it doesn't even compile"
2806880,2815520," because it's supposed to be state zero uh all right okay so um i wonder if it's gonna"
2815520,2826240," we can do a pretty cool all right for instance we can already animate things within fragment shaders"
2826240,2835280," right so essentially i multiply this thing by one but what if i do by zero nine nine nine so it's not only"
2835280,2840960," gonna make it green it's gonna make it slightly dimmer and then on the next iteration it's gonna make it"
2840960,2846160," slightly dimmer and dimmer and dimmer and it will effectively animate this entire thing right because"
2846160,2853840," the uh the previous frame fed into the next frame so it they form sort of like a feedback loop so by"
2853840,2862880," doing that it will basically like fade it out and that will confirm that we have um in like an actual"
2862880,2870000," algorithm that we can use for the uh for the cellular automaton this is actually pretty progress my friends"
2870000,2878160," this is pretty progress my friends so let's go ahead and do that uh well i mean we have to enable the uh"
2878160,2881360," you know the swapping of the states and stuff like that right"
2881360,2891440," that looks like why is it tearing uh but i mean okay that's fine but it's not supposed to tear do you see the"
2891440,2897200," tearing or is that the one no you don't see that or did you see that that is so weird"
2897200,2900240," do you see anything weird"
2900240,2904480," you see okay so let me"
2904480,2911520," okay on obs it doesn't really show on obs"
2913280,2918640," sometimes it just swaps so sometimes it just swaps out but i'm not really sure what the hell is going"
2918640,2924800," on so that's really weird okay so it is so that means it's something with my machine then okay that's"
2924800,2932640," very interesting uh okay it doesn't happen every time yeah and sometimes it just like completely swaps"
2932640,2934640," so it's just so weird bro"
2934640,2938320," this time it was all right"
2938320,2944480," i wonder if it's okay"
2944480,2956480," maybe we can try to use some image uh maybe we can try to use some image so uh let me try to take a look at"
2956480,2964560," the radio dot h what do we have in there so again perlin uh again image"
2964560,2969360," not get image"
2969360,2971520," pretty nice"
2971520,2978240," um so gradient radio checked um so i suppose it's a"
2979440,2987760," so let's let's try several i just want to confirm that"
2987760,2990160," this is not"
2990160,2996640," some sort of a bug in my code because i don't think it's a bug in my code my code is actually super simple"
2996640,3006160," right so tile size let's say is going to be maybe screen height this time divided by six right so let's actually keep it like that"
3008480,3014560," okay okay okay it's super smooth so what's important is that it's smooth on your side"
3014560,3026880," instead of swapping uh you just put contents of state zero to state one how do you put the constant"
3026880,3032480," of state zero into state one so that's the real question how do you put the constant one thing to"
3032480,3038400," another thing like i don't know uh so instead of swapping we by the way we can actually"
3038400,3046160," do something like uh render state state two how about that"
3046160,3050560," so then we can just do it like that there we go"
3050560,3057360," uh and then here we're gonna just have uh zero right so we initialize this thing with zero"
3057360,3064080," and then we can have something like size ti right so there is a very interesting trick"
3064720,3071680," uh that maybe younger developers don't know but if you have like i that you basically wanna flip-flop"
3071680,3078080," between zero and one one of the things you can do essentially is uh do i equal one minus i"
3078080,3088880," right so pause and pander on this specific expression right so if i is equal to zero if i is equal to zero"
3089920,3098240," this entire operation would will turn i into one if i is equal to one one minus one is gonna be zero"
3098240,3102000," as you can see it loops around so it allows you to actually flip-flop between zero and one"
3102000,3107920," uh right so this is actually very convenient sort of like a trick right uh if you never heard about it"
3107920,3114160," so now you know right isn't it obvious for some people it's not obvious uh it was not obvious for me as well"
3115040,3117680," so yeah feel free to feel good about yourself"
3117680,3129040," all right so and the thing we can do now all right we can basically say okay use an opposite one to"
3129040,3137040," render into the current one right uh so this is the opposite one and render into the current one right and"
3137040,3144960," then uh we are rendering the opposite one right so that's basically what we do and now to switch"
3144960,3149840," between them you just do uh i minus one right so you don't copy the texture if you don't really want"
3149840,3157120," to copy the texture so you can also probably maybe use like pointers but i mean yeah so that allows you to"
3157120,3163120," basically flip-flop between these two things uh effectively not sure if it's worth it right i'm not"
3163120,3170480," sure if it's worth it but it's something that you can do uh i suppose and so this is uh the state"
3170480,3172880," well we have to probably remove this and tapping"
3172880,3185040," okay uh so and you can effectively think about i as the pointer right so and you just like swapping between"
3185040,3196880," these two things okay i think the time has come to try to port our code to the to the thing right so"
3196880,3203520," let's take a look at our code right let's take a look at our code where it is uh where is it um so"
3203520,3207200," maybe i'm already streaming for one hour and i ran out of tea you know what that means chat"
3207200,3213200," you know what that means chats that means we need to make a small break right so a little bit of a"
3213200,3221680," tea time wouldn't hurt so um all right so let's go oh so how are we gonna uh actually port this entire"
3221680,3229440," thing so here uh the main sort of algorithm of a smooth life is compute grid diff right so in here"
3229440,3236640," we're iterating each individual pixel of the grid right but the main difference from the gpu is that"
3236640,3243360," this kind of outer loop is done by the gpu for us not not really by the gpu but at least by the graphical"
3243360,3248720," library right so when you're writing a shader right when you're writing a shader you're writing a program"
3248720,3254480," for a single pixel that's quite important to remember you're writing a program for a single pixel"
3254480,3262160," uh right so essentially that means that we don't need this outer loop but we do need everything within"
3262160,3268080," that loop right so basically uh looking at the current pixel and just looking at the neighborhood"
3268080,3275200," right so essentially this is the fragment shader right so this is what it means to write fragment"
3275200,3282160," shader right so and this is sort of one of the uh paradigm shifts that you have to mentally do when you"
3282160,3287760," start doing like a gpu programming is that you don't program directly into things anymore you program like"
3287760,3294640," like for like small batches of data and the gpu parallelizes your program into many many many many"
3294640,3300560," batches and stuff like that so you have to think in a more of a parallel uh paradigm now right so that's"
3300560,3305840," basically what you have to do uh so i literally copy pasted it i don't know like whether it's gonna"
3305840,3312320," work or not so let's actually go through this entire stuff um right uh we don't have a grid anymore"
3312320,3319520," right we don't have a grid anymore it's more of a grid now is the texture right so grid now is the"
3319520,3326480," texture so that's what it is and another interesting thing is that we here here we are iterating from"
3326480,3335200," zero to width and we measure everything in pixels right but the problem here is that uh here we measure"
3335200,3340000," everything in normalized texture coordinates and normalized texture coordinates are from zero to one"
3340880,3347440," so this kind of iteration is just simply not going to work so what i'm thinking is that we need to"
3347440,3354560," know the resolution of the screen uh the resolution of the screen in the shader somehow right we need"
3354560,3360160," to know it how can we even know it i suppose we need to pass it somehow right so as you can see we can"
3360160,3366400," have uniform we can introduce some sort of a uniform vector 2 called resolution right and we can ask the"
3366400,3372880," host program to just pass the current size of the window there so we can then uh basically scale"
3372880,3377200," everything according to the resolution and just at least understand what the hell is going on right"
3377200,3382480," so uh let's actually go ahead and try to do that so i think it's going to be rather interesting so i'm"
3382480,3387200," gonna just basically do something like this yes you can have a preprocessor in the shaders by the way"
3388800,3394800," uh you do have preprocessor you can do defines i think i don't know if you can do includes well i"
3394800,3402160," mean my mode of emacs actually highlights that you can do include but yeah uh but you can do defines you"
3402160,3409040," can have conditional compilation and stuff like that so which is useful sometimes i suppose uh all right so"
3409040,3415520," we want to pass the resolution but the question is how do we do uniforms in here uh let me let me see so"
3415520,3424240," i'm gonna go into the examples uh into the examples and let's maybe query um something for uniform but i"
3424240,3433840," don't really know what functions do you use for uniforms uniform uh is there any any stuff okay so"
3435440,3445600," uh example there was a yeah shader do you have any uniforms in here uh do we have any uniforms"
3445600,3454080," so the shader that we pass in here by the way so there's no shader in here god damn it uh okay so"
3454080,3460160," what kind of shaders do we have in here uh load shader all right so gray scale do we have a gray scale do we"
3460160,3469200," have additional uniforms in here i don't think so cold diffuse uh let me go through some of this stuff in"
3469200,3479040," here so maybe i'm gonna go in here glsl okay okay we don't have a custom things in here color mix"
3479040,3487200," okay so this one looks like a custom uniform right divider so that means it should be possible within"
3487200,3494080," example to find the following combination of characters double quote divided double quote"
3494080,3499520," and that will tell us what kind of functions do you okay get you okay okay that's that's precisely"
3499520,3506640," whatever you need to find so it's kind of similar to functions like gl get shader location but it's just"
3506640,3512960," like without gl prefix okay so that's cool um all right so we have some examples so we yeah okay"
3513680,3519280," uh okay okay so attributes that makes sense and then when you have a location uh you set it with"
3519280,3524800," this set shader you provide a pointer and then you specify what kind of type you have in here so that"
3524800,3531680," means set shader value uh accepts void pointer yes it does accept okay so that makes a lot of sense like"
3531680,3537040," you see you don't need a very sophisticated documentation you just need like a simple example"
3537040,3542080," and as soon as you have a simple example you can just like you know work off of that example and like"
3542080,3547440," derive the rest of the knowledge right so just a simple like a just simple line of an example and"
3547440,3555600," that's it you can derive all the knowledge from there um okay so that's pretty cool um so let's go"
3555600,3568400," uh divider log get shader location so smooth uh gpu so what kind of location do we need to find so we"
3568400,3576080," compile the shader in here uh get uh shader location uh so this is the share and we can provide the"
3576080,3581840," resolution so here's the resolution so the type of the shader location is integer so this is going to be"
3581840,3592960," integer uh resolution lock there we go so in here we can just set everything uh set shader value uh and we"
3592960,3600640," we probably have to supply vector two in here right i wonder uh what kind yeah so vector two and vectors"
3600640,3606480," three and we do have things like vector two all right so that means i need to put the resolution somewhere"
3606480,3615680," here um all right so vector two the resolution and we're gonna put screen width and screen height in"
3615680,3623360," there and there we go we've got our vector set shader value so here is the shader set shader value and what"
3623360,3630720," do we set in here so the set shader uh what is the other thing uh resolution location i can actually"
3630720,3639360," split the screen into two so i can see stop uh resolution location uh and then point it to the resolution"
3639360,3649200," shader uniform uh vec2 but it's not ivec it's a vec2 just there we go cool so i suppose we only need to"
3649200,3654960," set it once right so because we're not going to be changing resolution yet we're not going to be changing"
3654960,3659920," resolution yet maybe in the future we will but uh just enabling the residing on the window i don't"
3659920,3665200," think it's going to be enough because every time you resize the window you also need to resize the textures"
3665200,3669520," within which you're rendering everything so it's a little bit of a machinery that should build"
3669520,3673360," that you need to build on top of this entire thing and because of that i just don't want to do it right"
3673360,3680160," now um okay so we've got our resolution so i'm going to assume that we do have a resolution in there now"
3680160,3689600," but i don't have a way to confirm that yet at all right so i really don't have a way to confirm that it"
3689600,3695440," actually works so i wonder how can we confirm that we got the resolution right so how can we confirm that"
3695440,3705680," so fs let me go in here so essentially essentially we probably have something like gl frag"
3705680,3716000," gl frag chord and these are the coordinates of the of the fragment and as far as i know they are in the"
3716000,3725760," screen coordinates they are not normalized so if i try to do the uv mango right so essentially the gradient"
3725760,3733840," of uh you know red and and green so it turns into this sort of like a mangoish color uh i won't be able"
3733840,3739040," to do it with frag colors because frag coordinates because they're too big right if i try to do something"
3739040,3746640," like vector four gl frag coordinate y zero one it's not going work per se i think it's going to be like"
3746640,3759360," literally white uh and it's more of a green actually right so which is rather weird um right so if i if i put zero"
3759360,3766240," in here right in here right so this is weird this is straight up weird um"
3766240,3772560," gl frag why"
3772560,3781440," huh this is absolutely weird why it doesn't work so what gl frag action means in here"
3782480,3790720," so if we just use the frag code all right"
3790720,3798320," uh the frack core or what is the frac text code right so frac text code"
3798320,3801840," x"
3805760,3808640," why why it's gonna be a mango it's not a mango"
3808640,3817360," huh what the hell am i missing something chat"
3817360,3823200," am i missing something why this doesn't work"
3823200,3835360," hmm it's only the green and what if i put zero in here"
3835760,3841120," x z plane"
3841120,3846400," x z plane maybe why would it be x z plane"
3846400,3849760," that doesn't make any sense"
3849760,3857600," and on top of that"
3857600,3861440," why did it just work"
3862800,3865760," so okay we have mismatched oh all right"
3865760,3869760," swizzle mask z it didn't even work properly all right"
3869760,3873600," so i wonder if this is because there was some warnings in here"
3873600,3875600," uh"
3875600,3879040," this is so weird why"
3879040,3882880," this is a mystery"
3882880,3886400," because we just did that"
3887520,3895440," and it worked but it doesn't work anymore so do i have to go back or something um i can try to go back"
3895440,3904800," so here we just do that so there's also tint here blue which i don't really care about right so this is just gonna be white"
3904800,3908560," i wonder if it's changing anything"
3909280,3913520," it works wait a freaking second was that because of the tint"
3913520,3920880," was the tint messing up the coordinates as well that doesn't make any sense because i ignored the tint didn't i"
3920880,3924480," no oh okay"
3924480,3933520," okay okay okay that makes sense i see what was wrong since i don't set my custom shader on this rendering"
3934000,3938400," uh their their shader was actually messing up with the tint"
3938400,3943920," okay that makes okay that explains everything i freaked out for a second"
3943920,3949920," right so in here we do control the tint we can just disable the tint from the shader"
3949920,3955920," but as soon as we go here we have zero control over the thing so it's the territory of the default shaders"
3955920,3964000," all right this is actually very important right so the reason to to understand precisely what's going on is very important because"
3964000,3966560," shaders are really hard to debug"
3966560,3969520," if there is even slight"
3969520,3971680," uh confusion"
3971680,3978800," you better like spend extra time understanding what the hell is going on because if it's gonna you later you won't be able to understand why"
3978800,3985680," uh hard aka impossible yeah so if something weird going on just drill down to that and understand"
3985680,3990800," why exactly that happening otherwise it's gonna like it's gonna be a disaster you need to understand"
3990800,3993040," literally everything because it's so hard to debug"
3993040,3998720," um render dog sometimes helps yes so maybe this is something that we're going to employ today"
3998720,4000240," uh we'll see we'll see we'll see"
4000240,4004000," doing this kind of shit is actually super scary"
4004000,4012640," so dumb question what is shader really uh so it's a program that runs on gpu"
4013840,4020080," that's literally basically what shader is so you write a program in c it runs on your cpu"
4020080,4027360," uh right so to run program on gpu what you have to do you have to write that program in a shader language"
4027360,4030960," in one of the shader language languages like jlsl or hlsl"
4030960,4036000," then usually your c program has to take the source code of your shader program"
4036560,4043600," using the api calls of the graphic libraries like directx or opengl or metal they have to you have to"
4043600,4050000," compile the source code of that shader and then upload it to gpu for all of these actions there are"
4050000,4056080," functions in the graphical library and then you'll be able to run this thing on gpu so essentially how"
4056080,4061680," graphical applications work they start on the cpu then they prepare the programs that they want to run"
4061680,4067760," on gpu they upload it on gpu right on and they're running on gpu and cpu uh simultaneously and they"
4067760,4071760," sort of like synchronize with each other and they interact with each other so that's basically how it"
4071760,4078160," works so in share basically roughly speaking is a program that runs on your gpu as an opposite of"
4078160,4086080," running on cpu so that's basically what it is so these days there are some sort of like ideas that you"
4086080,4092960," first pre-compile your shaders into this intermediate language called spear v and instead of compiling it"
4092960,4098480," in the runtime you just load that bytecode of that spear v and you just give it to the graphics"
4098480,4104560," library so there is no compilation step in the runtime right there is a compilation step in the compile"
4104560,4111520," time or something like that but basically it's it's a program that runs on ugp so that's how you can think of it"
4115760,4126480," so uh so uh let's continue let's continue so uh what do we have in here so okay so what i wanted"
4126480,4135840," to do i wanted to actually use gl uh frag cord right gl frag cord is going to be x gl frag cord uh y"
4135840,4143680," right and if i try to run this entire thing this is this becomes yellows because uh this thing is so huge"
4143680,4150960," there's some line oh okay this is actually pretty cool so you can see that there is one pixel like"
4150960,4158560," one line pixel red and one like pixel one line pixel green and this is because the size of gl cord is in"
4158560,4165520," the size of the uh of the it's in the screen coordinates that's what i'm trying to say right"
4165520,4173360," it's in the screen coordinates but uh what we want here we want actually normalized coordinates so if we passed"
4173360,4179520," the resolution correctly just by dividing by the resolution we'll be able to normalize it back to"
4179520,4185680," zero to one right if we did everything correctly that's a correct manga this is a straight up correct"
4185680,4193680," manga uh moreover for some reason it feels like this is not open gl coordinates what the"
4193680,4205520," five wait a second the the black has to be here in open gl does ray lib uh inverts the vertical thing to"
4205520,4211600," to have like non-open gl coordinates or something i think i think that's what it does yeah so i suppose"
4211600,4217280," the the ray deep messes up the the coordinates and stuff like that right first who doesn't know this is"
4217280,4224240," what i call uh you know uv mango right so this is what they call you be mango right it's essentially"
4224240,4230480," when you take uv coordinates and you plug x into red and y into green and you end up with this gradient"
4230480,4240640," that looks like like like a mango right so that's what it is uh okay so and if we disable setting the"
4240640,4246000," value of the resolution that will not work that will be just black screen or it's actually it's"
4246000,4251680," actually rather interesting so unused resolution so i suppose we just had the garbage in there"
4251680,4256240," right so i would expect this thing to be zero and it would look well it's it you're gonna end up with"
4256240,4260320," the division by zero so that's probably why it didn't really work right and i don't really know"
4260320,4267120," how shaders handle the division by zero but i just confirmed that we successfully passed a resolution"
4267120,4271280," uh into the shader so shader is actually aware of this kind of thing so that's pretty cool"
4271280,4279200," cool so that means even though we have normalized coordinates uh we have normalized coordinates in"
4279200,4285840," uh in here right so we have coordinates from zero to one we can always convert them back into these pixel"
4285840,4291920," coordinates right it should be uh pretty straightforward to do that so specifically what do we care about so"
4291920,4298560," we use uh cx and cy and cx and cy is the coordinates of the current pixel we don't really have coordinates of"
4298560,4311280," the current pixel unless unless we do we can basically say that maybe x is gl frag coordinates uh frag but it"
4311280,4319280," will be better to actually like play by the rules and just like use frag text chord so this is cx uh take"
4319280,4326480," x and divide it by the resolution x and in here we probably want to floor it right and convert it to an"
4326480,4331520," integer right so that's probably what we want to do and we want to do the same thing with uh with y"
4331520,4339120," right there we go and we have a cx and cy uh and we can just use this entire stuff all right so can i now"
4339680,4346720," also have emode uh right so this is going to be the term uh emode uh let's copy paste to be fair"
4346720,4352240," it would be nice to copy paste like literally everything all of the sigma balls and all the other things"
4352240,4358720," right so all of that should be in here and we probably want all the parameters here as well"
4358720,4365040," right so the alphas and whatnot uh because all of that is kind of compatible with jlsl on the level of the syntax"
4365040,4373040," so i think it's going to work uh right so okay so the only thing we're missing in here is the grid"
4373040,4379040," so here we have x and y in screen coordinates but we need to be converting them to the texture coordinates"
4379040,4385360," and then getting the corresponding color so we probably need to come up with something in here"
4386080,4392720," maybe we can come up with some sort of a function grid uh which accepts x and y as an integer right"
4392720,4399040," so x and y is an integer and essentially it should convert uh x and y to the um"
4399040,4407360," or to the to the texture coordinates so it's going to be more of a like tx so we take x we're converting"
4407360,4413920," that back to a float and we divide that by resolution x and we repeat that thing for y as well so and this"
4413920,4420800," gives us the coordinates from zero to one that you can plug plug into the texture texture zero texture"
4420800,4426720," zero tx to y but i think you have to also provide it like this right so i think that's what you have to"
4426720,4434080," do so and that gives you some sort of a value so it's supposed to give you this thing right but here is"
4434080,4444800," an interesting thing it gives you the color so texture is in reality four values but the state of our of our"
4444800,4453040," cell is one value from zero to one how do we convert color to a state of the cell of the cellular automaton"
4454320,4460560," one thing we can say we can probably take the maximum out of them so like i don't have a like a"
4460560,4466480," any proper answer i think it's just like yeah just like take the maximum and that's basically gonna be"
4466480,4471600," the state of this thing uh so it's more of like a brightness right so this is basically the brightness"
4472240,4479280," um i think it makes sense so furthermore i suppose the pattern noise that we got from the array leap"
4479280,4485200," just only sets yeah it's basically the gradient of of white anyway so they're going to be all equal"
4485200,4490400," to to the same value anyway right so yeah that's how we're going to be interpreting this entire stuff"
4492000,4499440," cool uh so what else do we need in here so in here we're going to be doing uh grid x and y right so"
4499440,4507600," this is the function uh and this is going to be grid x and y there we go so that's it so then we plug"
4507600,4515520," it into s and this is by the way what we have to uh what we have to actually return right so but this is"
4515520,4521760," not really the final value this is not the next value right this is not the next value this is more"
4521760,4528480," of a diff right that we then need to apply to the current pixel and the current pixel is another"
4528480,4537600," interesting thing the current pixel is at grid cx c y right so what we have to do we have to do div"
4537600,4544160," uh plus div but also multiply it by dt did we actually copy dt yeah we did copy dt so this is"
4544160,4550640," basically what we have and that should give you the value out of which you probably want to construct the"
4550640,4557520," color like so right i guess that's basically i think maybe"
4557520,4566000," so okay let's give it a try so essentially i want to go through the compiler acety refactoring so"
4566000,4570400," probably this entire thing doesn't compile uh we're gonna go to the compilation areas of the shader and"
4570400,4576320," just like fix them as as we go uh my plan is going to be the following uh i'm not going to switch between the"
4576320,4582640," uh between the frames so it's going to be static right because i don't want it to go off too quickly"
4582640,4588960," right so i just want to first fix the shader and then see if it does the animation or not right so"
4589520,4594000," uh we'll see how it goes so let's try to compile this entire thing and uh of course it doesn't"
4594000,4599520," compile so let's take a look at what we have in here uh so there is some warning fail to compile"
4599520,4606640," sure no function exp okay so that makes sense does jlsl even have exp so let's actually find that"
4609120,4615600," let's find out does it have exp i think it does so return natural exponent of the parameter okay"
4615600,4624240," so that means it's just basically um exp just exp uh one of the things i remember you're also not"
4624240,4629920," supposed to have this apps at the end of the uh at the end of the literals that's what i remember"
4630720,4637760," nglsl because i've been annoyed by that for quite some time so all right so what else do we have in"
4637760,4646800," here uh so initializer type flow cannot be assigned to a variable of type int okay 67 67"
4646800,4654240," aha what do we have in here all right so i suppose we have to"
4656240,4665760," initializer of type float so what you want from you maybe ra and re has to be integers right because"
4665760,4670640," they are in pixel coordinates in the screen coordinates anyway so i guess it kind of makes"
4670640,4676240," sense for this thing to be an integer okay what are the next things uh so we can declare okay this"
4676240,4683200," one is interesting so width right so it is in fact and declare and this is because uh we have to do"
4683200,4693200," something resolution though um maybe we need to set the the wrapping mode for the texture instead that"
4693200,4703120," sounds like a pretty interesting idea hmm is there any wrapping modes for for the textures in raylib uh wrap"
4703120,4712480," texture wrap repeat maybe that's how we do that okay texture wrap so uh set texture wrap"
4714080,4720960," okay i wonder if that's what we have to do so i'm gonna put it to do in here because i'm not sure if"
4720960,4728720," it's going to work uh work uh use texture uh wrap mode instead because if we manage to use texture wrap"
4728720,4735120," mode instead first of all it's going to be less computations in here less computations and we'll be"
4735120,4742400," able to remove some code we just don't need emode anymore right so because yeah so using texture wrap instead"
4742400,4750640," would be actually ideal i think uh right so and then here here is kind of annoying because what you have"
4750640,4757040," to do here is just like also convert it to an integer because it's a float uh right so yeah we'll see"
4757040,4766160," but first i want this thing to to work and it compiled it seemed to be compiled uh right i hope it's not"
4767280,4775840," okay so do we have any warnings or uh failures or errors i don't think so right so it created"
4775840,4781600," successfully default shader unloaded successfully everything seems to be okay right so there was a big"
4781600,4794160," lag uh uh your gpu is cramped so okay i'm a little bit afraid so maybe i want to reduce some of these"
4794160,4795760," things in here right so"
4798480,4804880," is it lagging right now it is kind of lagging right so it's not lagging yeah okay so the camera is lagging"
4804880,4817840," when god damn it oh yeah i can see this shit lagging okay yeah so all right let me let me see let me see"
4817840,4828400," so let's try to enable uh this thing uh okay let's see if we'll be able to even do something like that"
4828400,4829440," it doesn't even work"
4832400,4839200," right what the okay so doesn't it didn't work it didn't do anything what if we use the perlin noise"
4839200,4847920," instead is it going to do something useful no it doesn't do anything so let me see did i make any"
4847920,4855040," mistake in here i actually don't think so do you guys see any mistakes"
4857040,4865920," so we oh yeah we probably want to multiply this thing okay that's a good point yeah that's a good"
4865920,4873280," point actually so we want to do okay just a second so when we're converting the yeah yeah i see what you"
4873280,4880960," mean thank you thank you so much uh stop gaming 58 i guess that's what we had to do in here uh when we"
4880960,4889760," do in mode so i don't really care if it's lagging or not if it's working all right i'm gonna be happy"
4889760,4896320," because it's gonna probably be fast when i'm not streaming if you know what i mean right uh right so"
4896320,4904160," it's slow because i'm also streaming because the obs also uses my uh my integrated gpu for encoding and"
4904160,4909120," stuff like that so i don't really have that many gpu resources anyway uh right"
4909120,4920560," you can see me lagging and pogging simultaneously that's actually kind of cool i'm lagging and pogging"
4924960,4933920," it's a funny phrase lagging and pogging uh so okay this is just like only one single frame right uh"
4933920,4938480," right so and if we go to the gpu"
4938480,4943440," and just starts switching between those things"
4952160,4953200," what the fuck is it doing"
4953200,4964800," lagging did we f how did we f like i mean uh we should be back actually"
4964800,4971280," it's not that okay all right so that was interesting"
4975680,4984240," so yeah that's weird uh maybe this is because uh we were trying to do 60 fps let's actually try 30 fps"
4984240,4996640," so all right so what about 30 fps uh so yeah it is lagging but it's not actually producing the the"
4996640,5004960," things yeah so it's not producing the picture i would expect it to produce if you know what i mean"
5006400,5012960," uh so i feel like i want to try to do the texture wrapping thing all right let's actually do the texture"
5012960,5018480," wrapping and just see how it's gonna uh work uh texture wrap"
5022800,5038000," so so smooth life uh texture wrap so i produce uh i provide state zero texture and uh texture wrap wrap repeat"
5038000,5046240," okay so this is for the first one and then uh for the second one as well"
5048880,5053760," so we can even split stuff like this so we're initializing the state zero right so we're also"
5053760,5059280," uploading the data to the state zero and then the state one and we do texture repeats so theoretically"
5059280,5069760," uh theoretically right what we have to do now is just int x uh cx plus dx and y c y plus d y"
5069760,5075920," right so we don't need in mode uh which effectively means that well i mean fine"
5075920,5087200," right so uh what do we have in here what do we have in here maybe i need to"
5087200,5090800," specify this thing as float so maybe it's converting stuff a lot"
5096240,5103680," i don't see any problems to be fair right so we don't see any problems um okay so gpu"
5103680,5108160," let's not swap these things"
5108160,5116640," okay that looks all right what if we now uh keep swapping them and it's"
5116640,5122240," yeah it's also switching around something what the hell is going on why is it"
5122960,5128960," wait wait wait by the way is it lagging it's not as lagging as much anymore as it used to"
5128960,5136080," did you notice that it's not lagging that much so that means i feel like it helped"
5136080,5140480," a little bit right i feel like it helped a little bit but not too much"
5141680,5144320," you know what i mean"
5144320,5154240," it's lagging audio is solid it's less like people sending me confused messages like like what the"
5154240,5160800," fuck uh all right so somebody some people say it's lagging some people say it's lagging less or"
5160800,5167760," something why is it flipping like that i'm so confused like there's no reason for it to"
5167760,5177360," do that question mark it's just like what that is weird straight up um all right so"
5182320,5184080," so resolution x and y"
5184080,5198080," so 15 was perfect right so 15 let's actually see uh if i do 15 right so 15 is more or less okay"
5198080,5207760," right so with 15 um maybe it's the default shader uh well i don't know right how is it gonna do that"
5209680,5210000," okay okay"
5210000,5221280," ah so that is weird that is really really weird like why would it start doing this kind of"
5221280,5221520," shit"
5221520,5227840," so if we are within that thing we're taking the grid"
5227840,5234480," by the way uh instead of"
5238880,5244720," to be fair we could have just like used floats in here there's no really a reason to"
5244720,5251200," yeah there's no really a reason to have this as integers if you think about that"
5251200,5262640," all right because we're not indexing any arrays so to speak all of that could be float like literally all"
5262640,5270480," all of that could be float um all right and that stuff could be also float as well i don't really know"
5270480,5276080," uh and by the way conversion between floats and integers like i heard that it could be kind of slow"
5276080,5284480," uh right so what i'm thinking is that yeah so keeping all of that as integers just like not gonna help anyone"
5284480,5290640," uh so it's just like here i probably what what i want to do i want to just like add one all the time"
5290640,5291680," right i'm adding one"
5294960,5298640," so that should actually be a little bit better"
5298640,5307440," all right so are we like okay it doesn't even compile properly uh okay let's take a look at 66"
5307440,5311680," yeah this has to be flawed of course it has to be flawed"
5313600,5318800," all right are we lagging we're not really lagging that much uh we're not really lagging that much so"
5318800,5325120," which is nicer nicer nicer and if i try to start swapping between these things"
5325120,5336480," why is it flickering like that this is so weird um so it's just so weird like there's no reason for it"
5336480,5358160," to flicker huh so let me maybe try the following thing uh frag so texture texture zero frag texture"
5358160,5362960," coordinates right and let me see can we see the original texture"
5364800,5366480," do you do you guys see it's flickering"
5366480,5370720," uh right"
5370720,5378160," so are you sure you meant one minus if for begin texture mode"
5378160,5382400," yeah that's what i meant to be fair"
5382400,5387360," right because it's zero so it needs to be rendering into one"
5387360,5394720," try to disable repeat you think it's because of the repeat"
5394800,5400400," no it's not because of the repeat it's something else"
5400400,5410960," feel like coordinate related uh sure but here i don't really modify anything so frag text coordinate"
5410960,5417200," right i just don't modify anything i can disable this entire code so this is the original vanilla"
5417200,5421440," shader shader that we used that actually we confirmed that it works by the way"
5421440,5430720," um right we confirmed that this thing worked this is literally what we did and it was not flickering"
5432720,5443520," uh um you need to apply this swapped texture to texture zero slot swapped texture to texture zero slot i don't know what that means"
5446080,5447360," uh so"
5447360,5456160," but i i kind of understand what that means in terms of opengl"
5456160,5461200," uh but i don't understand what it means in terms of raylib so"
5461200,5465520," that means that the opengl kind of leaks through raylib"
5467360,5470320," yeah it feels like a y is getting inverted every frame"
5470320,5477360," it would be kind of nice if raylib didn't try to mess with the coordinate system and just like"
5477360,5479520," used as whatever opengl used because"
5479520,5481600," okay"
5481600,5489040," so i suppose it could be because i have a custom shader"
5491920,5496320," i have a custom shader and the custom shader doesn't do the thing that"
5496320,5501280," the default shader does to map the coordinates or something like that"
5501280,5506160," is that what's going on it kind of doesn't help it makes things more complicated if the"
5506160,5510720," intent in the raylib was to make things like easier to understand it didn't really work out"
5510720,5516160," uh okay so let me try to take a look at some of the examples um all right"
5521920,5530320," uh so let me let me think let me think so there was a fog of war all right so we have a fog"
5530320,5535920," and let me take a look at the uh the fragment shaders so this is the shaders jlsl"
5535920,5540560," fog uh so there was just like a fog jlsl okay"
5540560,5548480," uh how do we so there's a light there is this kind of stuff so the texture so we're just like using"
5549600,5556240," but the weirdest thing like okay stop stop stop the thing that i did in here worked"
5556240,5560640," it did work it did freaking work"
5560640,5570240," so that means there's something no no no no it's not like the coordinates of my steps this thing worked"
5570240,5576240," it stopped working recently no no no you're not gonna gaslight me like that chat it worked before"
5577600,5584000," and then it stopped working because i specifically checked all of that i specifically checked all of"
5584000,5587760," that uh right yes"
5587760,5595440," it worked but at the same time there was a warning in here right so there was this kind of thing okay"
5595440,5606560," so i right if i just do something like this right it goes into an opposite thing right so i'm rendering the"
5606560,5612000," current thing the current thing the current thing into the back thing that's what i do"
5612000,5619680," into the back thing and then i'm rendering this one more time and then i'm swapping it"
5619680,5625760," but i can actually kind of swap it like this right i can swap it like this and just render it like that"
5626800,5628400," so yeah"
5628400,5634160," and now it works"
5634160,5637600," huh"
5637600,5642400," and now if i well i mean"
5642400,5646960," because that's what it has to be"
5648400,5654240," yeah so there's something with texture slots somebody mentioned texture slots"
5654240,5659760," and this is actually a very interesting idea so there must be something with texture slots"
5659760,5666400," but i'm not sure what exactly right is there something with texture slots"
5667360,5673040," uh no there's nothing like that so texture zero"
5673040,5679200," uh so"
5679200,5684960," uh draw texture"
5684960,5689920," something extremely weird going on"
5692800,5699840," and i don't really know why so i need more examples on how you work with uh with textures and whatnot"
5699840,5701520," let me see"
5701520,5708240," maybe more examples for render textures right so render texture 2d"
5709680,5713520," uh all right so hybrid renderers so this one sounds interesting"
5713520,5720400," uh low texture right so there's a target uh huh so there's a camera target blah blah blah"
5720400,5724480," texture mode okay so we're just doing that"
5724480,5728880," all right so and then we're just drawing"
5730160,5736960," uh target texture but there's nothing like that so unload render texture depth texture"
5736960,5744800," uh right so fabio hbf thank you so much for uh tier one subscription with the message"
5744800,5748640," all right"
5755600,5764800," it feels like something with the ray lib it feels like this abstraction is leaking right it feels like"
5764800,5767680," this abstraction is leaking somehow um"
5767680,5777280," yeah so like what is going on so is there any examples when you have several several render texture"
5777280,5784880," to to this right i feel like i feel like no right because yeah unload"
5785600,5790880," yeah attachment is okay so there is this thing"
5790880,5797120," okay there is a direct working with uh texture attachment and stuff like that"
5797120,5804080," which is a little bit painful right because i specifically picked ray lip so i don't have to"
5804080,5805120," do this kind of stuff"
5805120,5811840," not really big fan if i have to do this kind of stuff it's just like"
5811840,5816320," no i specifically use ray lip so i don't want to do that stuff thank you very much"
5816320,5819200," if i have to do this kind of stuff i might as well just ditch ray lib"
5819200,5821360," uh right so"
5827760,5835360," so this is a hybrid julia set maybe julia set is something that we can we can use in the mirror"
5835360,5842480," i'm getting disappointed at ray lip if this is what i have to do"
5844080,5863760," so i really don't see what's going on what's wrong right so unless it's something within ray lip really"
5863760,5871440," unless it's something within um maybe try copying the texture by update texture and some kind of rate"
5871440,5879600," texture seriously you are suggesting to send data over cpu like defeating the whole point i might as"
5879600,5887600," well like not use opengl then all right what's the point of using opengl then right you're suggesting"
5887600,5895600," like yeah just just opengl what oh okay so there is this kind of thing yeah just like send the data and"
5895600,5904640," copy it on cpu and just like seriously all right this one is actually kind of good thank you thank"
5904640,5911840," you so much somebody actually sending useful messages uh all right uh all textures in opengl by"
5911840,5917280," default have origin in the lower left corner while the screen origin is by default when you load norm"
5917280,5922880," okay where is the solution that you're what how is that"
5922880,5934240," but but how does it solve our problem our problem is not that it's uh flipped"
5934240,5943120," but it keeps flipping it's not because it's flipped per se it's because it keeps flipping"
5944320,5950960," right if it's just flipped once it's gonna just stay flipped but it's not gonna do that on every frame"
5950960,5959600," you there's this okay there's a subtle difference between coordinates just being constantly flipped"
5959600,5961920," and flipping on each frame"
5964160,5974240," right so if thing is just flipped i can just think in different coordinates and that solves the problem"
5974240,5986560," why it keeps flipping that's the problem and maybe that is actually a very good point uh to be fair because"
5988880,5996880," we're feeding okay so that's actually a very good point maybe what we have to do uh maybe we have to do is"
5996880,6002880," flip it in here all right what if i just do it like that then"
6010320,6020240," no it didn't solve the problem it's just like if you didn't mess with the coordinates maybe this would"
6020240,6030160," not be a problem oh yeah xc xc xc xc x it's just like just it creates more problem than it solves like seriously"
6031280,6035040," and um"
6035040,6047120," this is so painful dude like why do i have to wait a second i forgot to enable this thing wait a second"
6047120,6053280," okay so yeah i was i was working with it with a different thing okay okay okay so that should be fine"
6053920,6057680," so that means uh okay so i need to disable"
6057680,6064080," but maybe it's not a really problem right it's just like"
6064080,6070800," inconsistency of the coordinates of opengl it's just like i don't know i want to blame somebody i'm so"
6070800,6074800," disappointed that i have to deal with this kind of that i want to blame somebody"
6074800,6080960," right i just like really want to blame somebody and i have to blame either raylib or opengl so i need to"
6080960,6087600," pick one who who should i blame i cannot blame myself obviously i did everything right but somebody"
6087600,6091200," somebody screwed things uh things up it's either raylib or opengl"
6091200,6098560," okay that's a very good point that's a very good point okay so i think i now understand what the hell is"
6098560,6104960," going on all right so uh blame chat that's actually a good target so i think i'm gonna blame chat thank you"
6104960,6111600," so much thank you so much chat for allowing me to blame you all right so because i really need that"
6111600,6119120," right so nothing works and i want to blame somebody for that right um okay so essentially what we want"
6119120,6125280," to do in here right so we want to invert this yeah so and the reason why it flips around is because"
6125280,6130640," uh we're feeding it into like its own loop right so we keep feeding it into itself and it just like"
6130640,6136560," flip-flops and they finally understand why it's doing all of that so yeah thank you i'm sorry for"
6136560,6143200," being ranger today i just need to blame somebody so well i mean it didn't compile at least it didn't"
6143200,6153040," compile so uh we can forgive that 82 uh yeah what the hell is going on in here bro um so yeah this is"
6153040,6163360," basically what i wanted to do right so all right at least it's not flipping around but it's very square"
6163360,6170640," very squarish if you know what i mean uh right so is it lagging it's not really lagging but it's actually"
6171200,6181680," doing something um right so at least it's doing something uh so we're doing wrap repeat so that"
6181680,6189040," should work out okay uh so that's pretty poggers that's pretty poggers but why is it so squarish"
6189040,6197440," if you know what i mean why is it so squarish uh that's the real question so one of the things we can"
6197440,6209680," maybe do uh we can try to get rid of the m's and n's right uh by by essentially computing the uh areas"
6209680,6214800," of the circle right so what's the area of the circle area of circle i don't remember i don't remember"
6214800,6223120," school math thank you so much so area circumference oh queen circumference so that's the thing so it's"
6223120,6233440," basically uh pi r2 uh so of course i mean it's a square right so it is square so we have a pie uh"
6233440,6243680," right so give me the pie boy give me the pie oh okay so here's this is what is this pie give me the"
6243680,6252320," bigger pie google there we go that's the proper pie uh right i think jlsl doesn't have a pie right so you"
6252320,6258960," literally have to define it yourself right so this is gonna be the pie so what i want to do right so m"
6258960,6268960," is the inner circle right so it's an inner circle so that means it's um uh pi multiplied by ri ri"
6268960,6277840," so this one is actually rather interesting so it's an outer circle right so if m is the inner one this one"
6277840,6285520," is the outer one right but it's a area that excludes the inner one so we have to do something like"
6285520,6294080," minus m right and that way we can do something like this right we can effectively do something like this"
6294080,6302800," and then divide by these things right so i wonder if that's gonna fix something right i wonder um right so"
6302800,6308960," this is gonna be float so let's see"
6308960,6316880," maybe this is because of the floors because everything is so smooth maybe we don't really"
6316880,6323360," have to floor anything uh maybe that's another thing that i don't have to do in here uh right do we have"
6323360,6332160," a mode in mode i'm gonna just disable this thing for now all right so that reduces the amount of codes"
6332160,6339040," like at all that worked out i think yo what the it worked out"
6341520,6342720," holy shit it worked out"
6342720,6350160," i just had to make everything smooth that that's that's it that was the problem"
6350160,6355360," all right okay so we're onto something chat we're onto something let's make this"
6355360,6358080," uh white noisy let's make it white noisy"
6358080,6364160," and it died it literally died what the fuck"
6366000,6372480," okay so the radius is actually kind of meh maybe maybe it's too fast what if i make it smaller"
6372480,6378400," why is it dying"
6378400,6386160," it's just like it's just like yeah it's like whatever i guess"
6388160,6400640," it's kind of funny but this one is like it it exhibits like behavior of the smooth life if you"
6400640,6407280," know what i mean it does look like this thing i actually slowed down the dt i slowed down the dt"
6407280,6416880," but it has to has to be like around yeah so what what is the fps in here the fps is 15 so we can just"
6416880,6426320," basically divide that thing by 15 right so that's the basically fps so it should go faster so it kind"
6426320,6434640," of like moves uh-huh it kind of moves at the same time it's just like yeah fills up everything"
6434640,6442480," clearly maze generator well yeah if we take a look at whatever we had here right so it's kind of similar"
6443120,6444960," um so terminal right"
6444960,6454080," it generates similar structures right so if you let it run for a little bit uh it will essentially create"
6454080,6460800," a maze as well right it will essentially create a maze as well so maybe we should also initialize that"
6460800,6469760," thing with a specific region or something like that right so and at some point you will see that it will"
6469760,6476800," generate these streaks does it sound does it look familiar right so the same model kind of like generated that"
6476800,6486240," uh the same model kind of generated that so so that means we are on the right track right so because"
6486240,6492720," here it generated similar streaks as you can see right it generated similar streaks but it didn't start like"
6492720,6499600," creating like you know alive things uh if you know what i mean right it didn't start creating the live"
6499600,6506560," things unfortunately so but this is the pearly noise what about cellular there is also one thing that i"
6506560,6509280," i want you to try by the way that i want you to try by the way yo that's so cool"
6509280,6521840," right so that's actually super cool and it just fills up this thing down there right okay"
6524640,6534320," so uh remember how i was so confused about alpha like two alphas mentioned in the uh in the paper"
6534320,6542880," right so essentially here right uh they never actually mentioned alpha n and alpha m anywhere"
6542880,6548560," and then they suddenly said as we have two different types of steps we have alpha n and alpha m and that's"
6548560,6553760," it and they never actually mentioned it in any of the formulas in here they never explained how you're"
6553760,6559280," supposed to use alpha n and alpha m it's just like oh yeah obviously you have alpha n and alpha m and by"
6559280,6565200," the way to achieve cool results but you have to set them to here but how do you use them they're never"
6565200,6570720," mentioned in any of the freaking formulas it's just like what the like i went through the entire paper"
6570720,6575920," several times and just like what the are you talking what what are you smoking what are you smoking"
6575920,6583920," there's no alpha n and alpha m i was thinking about that chat i think i figured it out i think i figured"
6583920,6591920," it out so i'm gonna show you right i tried to smoke the same thing as the author uh of this paper and i"
6591920,6599600," think i understood what they were trying to say right so you need to actually draw uh this formula so basically"
6599600,6606560," we have a bunch of things here depending on each other right so these things this uh so the functions"
6606560,6612560," they depend on each other you need to draw the dependency that's the key i'm gonna show you uh"
6612560,6620560," you must draw the dependencies it's so dumb okay you're gonna see that all right so"
6623040,6629040," uh so i think i'm gonna close this thing right so first what we what we have in here we have s uh"
6629040,6635840," which is function s right so this is a function s what does it depend on it depends on two functions"
6635840,6643120," it depends on sigma 2 and sigma m right so let's actually do uh sigma 2 so this is a sigma 2 and this"
6643120,6650000," is the sigma m right and we literally draw the dependency graph of the of the functions right so the function"
6650000,6661200," s depends on sigma 2 and sigma m makes sense sigma 2 depends on uh sigma 1 right so we can say that"
6661200,6670000," here is the sigma 1 right so this is a sigma 1 so sigma 2 depends on sigma 1 and uh sigma m here you can"
6670000,6679840," see it depends on sigma 1 right so the these four functions they form this sort of diamond they form the"
6679840,6688560," sort of diamond and sigma 1 already depends on an unnamed alpha right it depends on an unnamed alpha"
6688560,6698320," so this is basically the dependency graph and look at very interesting thing so sigma s what specifically"
6698320,6706480," s accepts two parameters n and m right so you have n right you have n and you have m right and you feed"
6707120,6716800," those parameters into the s and look how s redistributes the parameters n goes into sigma 2"
6716800,6732320," so n goes into sigma 2 and m goes into sigma m right so but then uh these two parameters go into sigma 1 so"
6732320,6739600," that means that the sigma 1 that is used by sigma 2 has to use alpha n and sigma 1 that is used by sigma m has"
6739600,6748880," to use alpha m so it would make more sense if that alpha was just the parameter of sigma 1 and sigma 2"
6748880,6751280," was just called sigma n"
6754080,6758000," what the hell is wrong with this people like why did you have to do it like that"
6758000,6765600," like if you just draw it out like that it kind of makes sense like but why do you have to make it so"
6765600,6771680," cryptic like why don't you make alpha the parameter you just make alpha the parameter you get rid of the"
6771680,6778400," sigma 2 you call it sigma n and sigma m and since you only have one sort of like sigma you can remove this"
6778400,6783920," thing so we can just say this is a pure vanilla sigma this is the sigma n and this is a like"
6783920,6788160," it's just like i'm"
6792880,6801920," so there is obviously a cultural problem in here in our coding culture if you write a shady code you're"
6801920,6808640," going to be humiliated immediately right you're going to be humiliated immediately right if instead of"
6808640,6818800," just uh doing something like if true uh return like if x return true uh else return false you do something"
6818800,6822160," like that you're going to be instantly humiliated because what you're supposed to do you're just"
6822160,6829440," supposed to do return x in mathematical world apparently whatever you write using this beautiful"
6829440,6837920," beautiful font is already beautiful by itself so these people go absolutely unchecked they write"
6837920,6843200," shitty formulas and they go absolutely unchecked and everyone thinks that they write beautiful things"
6843200,6848800," i think we need to bring bring that a culture this programming culture into the map and keep these"
6848800,6854080," people in check so they don't write shady math you know what i'm talking i'm joking by the way"
6854080,6862800," right i feel like there's no such culture in mathematical world right so"
6866000,6873840," the power of later you just use a fancy font and it looks beautiful uh so"
6873840,6880240," obviously i'm joking obviously i'm joking right so"
6880240,6888400," we need to start bullying mathematicians don't bully anyone please don't bully anyone"
6891520,6899280," okay so i think that was the intent at least it was written in a very cryptic way but i feel like"
6899280,6906000," that was an intent right and what what i'm thinking is that maybe if we just code this entire thing like"
6906000,6914080," that maybe then it will work maybe maybe we'll see we'll see okay so let's actually give it a try"
6914080,6921280," so i'm gonna bring this stuff like so okay so where is my paper so alpha n is 28 right so"
6921280,6930320," alpha n is 28 so this is alpha uh n right and this is alpha m i'm gonna fix the terminal version"
6930320,6938720," people from machine learning are also famous to make hard to review code well i mean this is"
6938720,6939920," basically job security"
6946720,6952800," okay okay so what i want to do uh i want to go to sigma one and i want to accept the alpha like this"
6952800,6959280," in here right so this is going to be alpha and i'm going to literally rename sigma 2 to sigma n"
6959280,6963360," right and sigma m maybe i'm going to also underscore it so it's a little bit easier to read"
6963360,6974000," uh right so and since it's sigma n right i'm going to be passing uh alpha n in here right so this is going to be alpha n"
6974000,6983600," and since this is sigma m i'm going to be passing um alpha m in here and now it makes perfect sense in"
6983600,6991440," here it's just like yo bro that just makes sense and it's just like so beautiful like you have sigma n"
6991440,6996160," you pass n in there you have sigma m you pass m in there and they're used corresponding alphas and"
6996160,7002160," it's just like it makes sense like this is what should be written in paper in the first place in my"
7002160,7010000," all right so yeah that just makes perfect sense"
7010000,7019120," at least like i don't know if it works uh but we'll see we'll see uh so let me try to"
7019760,7026720," build this entire stuff so just a second we're not gonna run anything i'm gonna just like rebuild"
7026720,7030960," okay so it's complaining so sigma one so this has to be yeah"
7030960,7038720," okay it's it's it's working so let's take a look if these parameters produce something"
7044960,7045680," that is cool"
7045680,7054720," well i mean it's it's more interesting you you saw the pulsar did you see the pulsar it's it's like"
7054720,7063600," well i mean it's it didn't break it at least yo it's it's kind of more alive in some sense"
7063600,7072240," well it still like converges to this stable state but i think it was a little more interesting sometimes it"
7072240,7077120," dies out but all right so okay"
7077120,7087760," it's a little better but i don't think it's that much of a difference"
7087760,7094560," and it still converges to to this thing"
7097680,7100720," it's it's breathing you can you can see how it's breathing"
7100720,7104400," it's kind of cool like these sort of like things"
7104400,7110560," oh look look look it's actually moving it's it's i feel like it's more alive than the previous version"
7110560,7115840," yeah it's breathing it's actually alive"
7115840,7123040," cute i already killed it don't worry okay so let's actually try to use this uh in the shader right so"
7123040,7129680," maybe that will make the shader more interesting who freaking knows i don't freaking know uh right"
7129680,7131600," so let's bring the parameters there"
7131600,7144160," so maybe it's gonna do something i'm gonna keep the dt the same right so this is gonna be that and let's"
7145280,7154560," change the the sigma the sigma stuff the transition thingy right here is the transition thingy so we're"
7154560,7162400," using a different transition now okay so we're gonna rebuild everything and let's just try to run"
7162400,7169600," the gpu stuff i should have actually run it right away smooth the gpu and okay it didn't compile that's"
7169600,7176240," why it was flipping around so it's expf okay so that's okay i i need to fix all the mistakes here again"
7176240,7180160," god damn it uh right so this has to be that"
7184640,7190720," do we have anything else by the way i think i think i forgot something important"
7190720,7197600," aren't you supposed to also clamp this shit yo what the in the original term"
7197600,7205600," we were clamping that do we clamp anything in here we don't clamp it this is important chance"
7207280,7214400," this is important so there were 0.5 where okay yeah i mean the compiler will tell me so do we have clamp"
7214400,7215120," in glsl"
7215120,7222560," so i think clamp is okay so there is clamp so what what are the parameters"
7222560,7229920," uh okay so minimum and maximum are to second and third arguments okay so we can just do something like"
7229920,7232880," clamp uh zero one"
7236560,7244800," so clamping is yeah it's a very important thing um okay so can we now try to run this entire thing"
7244800,7254880," freaking re re 24. so dt okay so i just redefined this entire thing that's"
7254880,7265040," it's starting doing something here but i'm not sure if it's going to"
7265840,7271040," it just goes into a very stable state which i'm not really a huge fan of"
7271040,7275040," right i'm not a super huge fan of"
7275040,7284000," uh right so let me let me try a different thing now gpu"
7284000,7288400," so what about perlin noise so not a cellular one"
7288400,7294480," so all these things result in the very stable structures it's kind of works but it's not what i want"
7295120,7298800," right so this is definitely not what i want and it kind of behaves like"
7298800,7304960," like what i want white noise maybe it should be more uh dense"
7304960,7309520," let's try white noise"
7309520,7322400," it just falls into a very stable state that i'm not a huge fan of i want this thing to be alive but it's not"
7322400,7323600," it doesn't want to be alive"
7323600,7327680," uh ra is different"
7327680,7349440," so maybe uh we should like initialize our own thing right but um let's go ahead and initialize our own"
7349440,7358480," thing so i'm gonna basically do image image again image color all right so again image color uh and"
7358480,7365200," oh by the way what we're supposed to initialize this with i think it's like um"
7365200,7376160," things from zero to one that would make even more sense i suppose uh but anyway so again color um screen width"
7377200,7386240," screen height and um black right so this is going to be black but the thing i want to do now uh i want to"
7386240,7391840," iterate actually we'll start with the integer so it's going to be white uh less than screen"
7391840,7395920," height and it's going to be fourth"
7398080,7409920," all right so then it's going to be x x width x and for each of these things so in raylib uh set um"
7409920,7418240," what is that draw pixel something something something uh texture or maybe image draw yeah image draw pixel"
7418240,7428240," oh yeah i don't know that um all right so image draw pixel and that is going to be basically x and y and the"
7428240,7433680," destination is going to be that specific image but the color the color is very interesting so"
7435280,7444400," we can basically say that we're gonna have something like this uh but the v is going to be"
7444400,7453920," uh some sort of like a q but multiply by 255 right so something like this"
7455920,7460160," uh in the queue is going to be uh in the queue is going to be we might as well actually do something"
7460160,7466960," like around the float and we can copy paste around float from uh from here right"
7466960,7473200," so it doesn't have that"
7476240,7484000," so image uh you int it wants integer once integer this has to be a pointer"
7484000,7492800," all right and it just keeps growing it's not really producing anything interesting per se it just keeps growing"
7501200,7508240," maybe this is because of the parameters because i simplified the shader as much as i could actually"
7508240,7512320," if you think about it i simplified it as much as i could"
7512320,7524000," and what if i remove this minus one is that something we can actually do is that a good idea"
7531200,7540000," it's just growing it's just growing but i mean it kind of behaves like the original thing"
7540000,7546800," but it doesn't separate right it's too stable that's what i would say it is it's kind of too stable"
7546800,7555280," it's kind of too stable it just generates this sort of um you know mazes and stuff like that"
7556800,7563440," but maybe this is because of the parameters that we're using here maybe this is because of the parameters"
7563440,7579440," so if we set the dt like so"
7585040,7594400," what if i make dt even faster it will be less stable okay finally it's doing some okay so i"
7594400,7599920," should have actually made it fast so it's doing something interesting um okay"
7599920,7608720," that was cool did you see that did you freaking see that it did a thing all right so i think i need"
7608720,7614960," to okay i need to increase the dc for for this specific thing to actually make it do"
7614960,7620720," the interesting stuff uh what about like eight i think i think i found it"
7620720,7627200," yo yes"
7627200,7638320," okay and it still like goes to this stable state all right uh what about like literally one"
7638320,7639200," let's make it one"
7639200,7654160," okay so uh in that specific case we can actually use uh noises and stuff like that uh purlin noise"
7658560,7659200," all right"
7659200,7664000," so there we go continuous game of life everyone"
7664000,7667120," actual continuous game of life"
7667120,7678160," yo what the i think yeah so essentially it was too slow"
7681440,7688160," it's so cool it creates this gliders that only yo this is an epic win okay so that was the goal of today's"
7688160,7695680," stream actually that is so freaking cool look at that look at this go what the oh my god and it keeps"
7695680,7701280," going that's that's exactly what i wanted to achieve when i started this entire project oh my god that's"
7701280,7717520," what i wanted to see what the what if i make it like i'm afraid to make it make the radius even bigger"
7717520,7724800," i feel like uh the sizes of these gliders actually very much depend on the radius on our a uh right if you"
7724800,7733200," give it more they become kind of bigger um all right we can try to to make it like 17 21 would"
7733200,7738880," have been ideal but it's going to be too too slow yeah you see they're bigger but it's just slower"
7738880,7743840," all right you can keep increasing the radius if you make the radius bigger it's just like means"
7743840,7751600," that it has to consider bigger neighborhood uh right so we can't really change the radius that much"
7751600,7756320," but we can try to change the the size of the of the window that's a good idea somebody suggested"
7756320,7765280," all right so let's give it a try uh we can try something like 16 uh right factor by nine"
7765280,7773120," all right and we can say okay so the factor is going to be uh 18. all right so that's basically"
7773120,7778240," the thing so it needs to generate the permanent noise uh all right so it's doing things i hope it's"
7778240,7784960," going to actually get bigger at some point and it goes somewhere but yeah so the the sizes of the"
7784960,7791760," gliders kind of stay the same and so it just like goes on the side so i don't think it's uh it's that great"
7795280,7814480," that it's working on a smaller window if we multiply the width and height by a half"
7814480,7817920," it will literally think that it has a smaller window"
7820320,7826000," yo i mean that is dreamy like what the hell is going on why it is like that"
7826000,7840240," that is weird right i was expecting it's oh i think i know what the is going on right no"
7845680,7851920," it's it's yeah it's they're overlapping but i don't know what why would they think they are overlapped"
7851920,7858800," because it's just supposed to just scale the entire thing what if i multiply it by two in here will it"
7858800,7861600," will it change anything um"
7861600,7866640," yeah it's kind of weird so"
7868720,7872800," so it's probably something something weird"
7872800,7885440," yeah but this is cool it would be kind of nice to uh like make it bigger right"
7889200,7899520," but yeah it's so cool uh all right so let me see what i can do so we're using a resolution in here"
7899520,7906240," right so we're using resolution and so essentially that's what we do"
7906240,7915680," so yeah just by making the resolution smaller it should make it think that"
7916400,7923360," yeah so it that should effectively work but it doesn't and i'm not really sure why i'm really"
7923360,7930800," not sure why because when we're accessing the grid we are dividing that little thing by x"
7930800,7934640," uh but yeah"
7939440,7945840," so if we had this sort of like a scalar right resolution uh scalar"
7945840,7951840," resolution scalar and then just"
7951840,7956960," half or maybe 75."
7956960,7966080," i cannot explain this overlapping behavior thing especially when i do have like i literally cannot"
7966080,7973760," explain it why would it behave like that is it because of the rap i don't think so i don't think"
7973760,7976480," it's because of the rap because we're just like mapping"
7976480,7983040," i think i can explain that yeah okay"
7983040,7987840," yeah i see what's going on"
7990960,8003280," yeah so um essentially to make it work to make it work we have to set a rectangle so yeah essentially"
8003280,8008720," what i'm doing i just like setting the bigger pixel one okay so one of the things i can do in that case"
8008720,8015040," one of the things i can do i can just like have a smaller texture a texture smaller than the window"
8016400,8022800," right right and then just scale it up one of the things i can do so uh in that case by the way i"
8022800,8027120," think it would be nice to maybe use floats in here it's going to be converted to integers anyway so who"
8027120,8034880," cares so texture width uh right so texture width is going to be screen uh width but let's say it's"
8034880,8042720," going to be half of that right so texture height right right so we create the window over the screen"
8042720,8050640," width and height but for the image we're generating a texture uh like this so and it would make sense"
8050640,8057440," to actually have a scalar scalar uh which is going to be half of that right because we're going to be"
8057440,8063680," using that to scale this thing so this is the scalar all right so this is the texture so in here i"
8063680,8073840," need to replace screen with texture boom okay so here we load the texture so it has to be like through"
8073840,8082480," the entire entirety of this thing i think screen and texture yeah they should be replaced uh-huh so and"
8082480,8094640," when we're rendering the texture draw uh texture one of these things support the scale they do support"
8094640,8106560," scale so uh if we do something like this so we can provide the state i texture we can provide the position"
8106560,8114240," which is going to be so this is one of the times when i need to use colliderial uh colliderial vector"
8114240,8122800," two zero rotation is going to be zero uh scalar we have to do the opposite of the scalar so um"
8122800,8134000," so i need to scale it twice so that means if i do the invert of the scalar right if i do one over five"
8134000,8137600," okay so that's perfect actually that's exactly what i want and the tint is going to be white"
8137600,8144480," right so yeah essentially i just like make the texture smaller but then i scale it up"
8144480,8150960," and on top of that we may want to set different interpolations in there like uh so by default i"
8150960,8155360," think it's going to be using by linear interpolation so it's going to smooth things out anyway so it's"
8155360,8162800," not going to be pixelated hopefully uh right so that's actually a cool idea i think all right let's go"
8164160,8170560," that's much better so you can see it much better now uh we can keep scaling this thing up we can say"
8170560,8177840," it's 0.3 and uh we can see these things even better now that's actually really cool they're slightly"
8177840,8183200," pixelated but uh wait it doesn't use bilinear interpolation okay so let's actually set bilinear"
8183200,8193840," interpolation uh really uh bilinear uh interpolation texture and how do you do texture interpolation one"
8193840,8203600," more time does anyone remember set texture filter okay so this is a filter um okay so filter uh shader"
8203600,8211280," log texture filter okay so bilinear this is what we need in here chat this is what we need um so i can set the"
8211280,8222400," texture rub uh i can also set texture filter right so we're setting these things uh texture filter bilinear"
8222400,8228400," all right there we go so we're making it wrapping around we're making it bilinear and wrapping around"
8228400,8234640," the texture i think still think it's kind of important uh right so does it look smoother that looks much"
8234640,8245360," smoother now we can make it like you know 16 by a nine as we initially had 16 factor"
8245360,8256720," factor and let's make it maybe even 100 so it looks nice you know uh is it gonna look good is it gonna look"
8256720,8263280," gucci it's gonna look at tamaguchi chat how do you like them gliders and they all died"
8264640,8275360," uh right so yeah they don't have that much like interaction with each other so yeah let's try"
8275360,8281200," different uh initialization so this is a perlin noise what about white noise now so maybe maybe white"
8281200,8286400," noise is going to work out white noise didn't work out so i think it has to be a little bit denser"
8288080,8297360," uh did it work out i think it literally died all right so if i do it like it instantly dies unfortunately"
8297920,8302400," so cellular without cellar it's a little bit better i think"
8302400,8311920," we can use someone"
8311920,8323280," so this is the smooth life it's as smooth as you can get one of the interesting thing would be"
8324320,8329920," uh would be able to draw on this thing so i click on this thing and it maybe creates a circle"
8329920,8335200," but how can you draw on that thing"
8335200,8343840," i don't really know yeah they kind of feel like metables but they're not really metables"
8343840,8353200," these gliders don't really survive for too long holy what the is going on they look like bubbles right"
8353200,8359680," they they they pop in like bubbles and stuff like that uh you got it metables nice yeah metables are"
8359680,8365680," actually super fun um yeah i love a lump"
8365680,8375680," uh that's so cool and what's interesting is that it does look like an original discrete game of life"
8376320,8383200," but continuous but continuous right it's just like it's continuous but it has the same sort of like"
8383200,8389920," behavior uh of the things it's just so weird that it's just like it behaves similarly um"
8389920,8397920," no more lagging well i mean we reduce the resolutions and stuff like that and we just like"
8398560,8405120," adjusted everything so it doesn't like that much uh honestly i would love to maybe"
8405120,8412960," make the bigger radius but i feel like um the bigger radius is gonna just like make it laggish again"
8412960,8420240," no really actually if you look at that it's a bit laggish but at least they are bigger now right"
8423760,8435680," that's cool um they're not really glad is the split and die yeah though we could have uh adjusted some of"
8435680,8443280," the parameters in here right so maybe i could adjust this thing to be 68 i know how sensitive it is to the"
8443280,8446800," parameters in here is it really sensitive"
8446800,8459040," well if you like it is sensitive okay so let's not do that so i know on the shader toys uh there is"
8459040,8466880," a similar implementation okay so shader toy a smooth life so and it has some parameters that maybe we can"
8466880,8472320," steal from it right so we can try to steal some parameters for this thing unfortunately the problem"
8472320,8479600," with uh sherry toys is that it kills my setup when i'm streaming so i'm really hesitant to run this"
8479600,8486720," thing okay so i paused it i paused it so this thing has some parameters that we can yoink so specifically"
8486720,8496080," b1 b2 d1 d2 uh right so smooth life l right so specifically smooth life l rules uh and they're kind of"
8496080,8502000," different from what is in the original paper we're using parameters from the paper though right so and what"
8502000,8510400," what about the radii does it set the radius i mean radius something uh it's using radius in a different"
8510400,8517120," in a really weird way i don't know what else using them uh whatever so i'm gonna just use these parameters"
8517120,8523520," so it's probably not gonna act the same right it's probably not gonna act the same"
8526000,8537120," uh const uh const so i'm gonna put this thing in here um around as you can see they are slightly different"
8537120,8545280," right uh so from the stuff specifically the death and birth intervals they're different they're slightly"
8545280,8558720," different um stolen from this thing all right so this is gonna be one 257 okay so let's see if it's gonna"
8558720,8566560," change anything make it interesting more interesting maybe uh all right all right all right so let's see"
8566560,8574960," it creates really weird creatures actually"
8577600,8580400," look look at those gliders are so creepy like what the"
8580400,8591040," i think i like this original one so it's probably coded slightly different"
8591040,8599280," oh yeah so that's basically the result of today's stream"
8600400,8605840," uh right it's not particularly stable but when it becomes stable it's actually kind of cool it just"
8605840,8612800," like keeps going and going and doing things uh right i guess that's it for today thanks everyone"
8612800,8620560," who's uh watching me right now i really appreciate it have a good one and i see you all on the next"
8620560,8627360," recreational programming session so yeah that's pretty cool i love you"
