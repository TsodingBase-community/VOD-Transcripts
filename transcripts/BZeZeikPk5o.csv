0,4800," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreation programming session with Amisto"
4800,11040," Zozin where we're developing a retro 3D engine in web. You want to take a look at it? You want"
11040,16960," to take a look at it? Okay, so we go to localhosts6969 and you're greeted with this beautiful"
16960,22640," retro 3D engine. Look at that, look at that. It runs at 30 fps. It's supposed to run at 60 fps"
22640,27040," but since I'm streaming like I can't run it at 60 fps but trust me,"
27840,34240," fucking trust me mate, it runs at least at 60 fps. You can actually check it for yourself, right, so"
34240,39280," you can go to the description and find the link to the source code. There is also a link to the"
39280,46560," instance on GitHub pages, right, sorting.github.io raycasting. You can find the deployed"
46560,50160," instance there and actually check it for yourself. I'm going to put that in the description, there we go."
50160,57280," So my end goal with this entire thing is to actually make a game out of that,"
57280,62960," something like a roguelike, but I haven't decided what exactly. But the only thing we're able to"
62960,69680," render right now is floor, ceiling and the walls. Right now we have only one wall but I can actually"
69680,76000," maybe extend and add more walls, right, so nothing really stops me from doing that. So let me actually"
76000,80960," find TypeScript. So I can like put a couple of things in here, like a TypeScript in here,"
80960,86400," then maybe TypeScript in here and maybe TypeScript in here. So I can do something like this."
86400,92800," And, right, so then as you can see I have actually several walls in here. I can actually wander around,"
92800,97280," you know, between the walls and stuff like that. I can actually change the texture as well."
97280,102400," Right, so I just had coded TypeScript because it's in TypeScript and stuff like that."
102960,109440," Right, so but that's not particularly useful. That's not particularly useful. We want to be able to have"
109440,116240," some sort of like items, right, so smaller items and maybe some sort of particle effects and stuff like"
116240,122720," that. So usually in this kind of like old-school raycasting 3D engines, they are indicated with"
122720,127920," sprites. Right, so we're going to be continuing following the same tutorial that we followed like"
127920,133280," before. Not really following, right, because this tutorial is so obtuse that I can't imagine myself"
133280,138160," like actually following this tutorial. So what we're going to be doing, we're going to be getting"
138160,145920," inspired by the tutorial. Right, so here they kind of have a recipe on how to render the sprites,"
145920,149840," and this is just like a seven points in here. We're going to read them and try to get inspired"
149840,155360," and try to implement it ourselves. Right, and the sprites usually in that 3D space, they look"
155360,160080," kind of like this. You probably, if you ever played like a Doom, the first original Doom,"
160080,165840," you kind of know what I'm talking about. Like these sprites, they 2D, but there is a place,"
165840,170000," yeah, it's called Billboard. Yeah, somebody in the chat actually knows. Right, so they're kind of 2D,"
170000,177520," but they are located within the 3D space and always rotated towards you. Right, no matter where you're"
177520,182320," looking at them, they're always like rotated towards you, and this is because they're not rendered in 3D"
182320,188880," perspective. Right, so they're sort of like not really 3D object, they're more like an indication of"
188880,195040," 3D object. Right, more like an indication because they're easy to render. All right, so and the fact that"
195040,200480," they're facing towards you like constantly is actually like a side effect of not like doing a"
200480,205360," proper perspective or anything like that. You just slap it on the screen and that's why it appears"
205360,210000," constantly facing towards you, right, because you don't do anything about that. It's kind of actually"
210000,217440," interesting. So yeah, once we have a mechanism within our engine to render these kind of sprites,"
217440,224160," we can have items, maybe some sort of collectible items within the game, and also we can use the"
224160,229280," sprites as particles, so that means we can use them as bullets. Right, so for example maybe you're shooting"
229280,234960," something, you can use them as enemies. Right, so all of these dynamic entities that move around that are"
234960,241040," not really part of the environment, they could be denoted as sprites. Right, so I think it's a really"
241040,247040," valuable mechanism for these kind of sort of like games and that's why I want to implement this entire"
247040,253520," thing and add it to our engine. So let's actually read how you're supposed to do that, right. So we"
253520,261040," already know how to raycast walls, we know how to raycast floors and ceiling. How the fuck do you raycast"
261040,268480," sprites? Okay, so while we're casting the walls, store the perpendicular distance of each vertical stripe"
268480,276400," in a 1D Z-buffer. This is a very interesting point. So do you guys know what is a Z-buffer?"
276400,282800," Do you guys know what is a Z-buffer? It's kind of an interesting concept. Right, so it's usually used in"
282800,292640," proper 3D and essentially whatever you see on the screen is called a color buffer. So essentially"
292640,301600," it's a buffer that contains color pixels, right. So parallel to that color buffer, quite often in OpenGL"
301600,309120," or any like graphics APIs or anything like that, there's so-called Z-buffer. So it's a buffer of the"
309120,318160," same size as the color buffer but instead of pixels it stores a single floating point value, the Z-value."
318160,329520," The value of the Z-coordinate. So the question is the Z-coordinate of what is it storing? The Z-coordinate"
329520,336720," of a pixel. Look at that. So you can look at this sort of surface and you notice that this surface,"
336720,345360," this side of the cube is sort of like tilted. The actual Z-value of this pixel on this edge is actually"
345360,355840," closer to you than the Z-value of that pixel on that edge. And Z-buffer literally stores a Z-value of each"
355840,361360," an individual pixel, usually in OpenGL. We're talking about OpenGL, by the way. I'm not talking about the"
361360,367280," actual raycasting or old school raycasting. Like generally in 3D graphics, this is what Z-buffer is"
367280,375040," called. And what is it used for? It is used for determining which pixel is visible and which pixel"
375040,383360," is not visible, right. For example, you may have two polygons that are intersecting each other. How do you"
383360,389920," render them? You need to know the Z-coordinates of each individual pixels to actually create some sort"
389920,397600," of a scene. We actually look into the Z-buffer mechanism in Olivet's series, I'm pretty sure. So let's"
397600,404320," actually open it. So let me let me open this entire thing. So I'm going to put that in the chat. And also"
404320,410320," for people on YouTube, I'm going to put that in the description. Right, so here is that. And we have a little bit of a"
410320,416560," proper 3D in here. There we go. So here is the good example. So you have two polygons that"
416560,424240," intersection each other. And to create this theme, we actually used a Z-buffer to know which pixels to"
424240,430480," draw and which pixels to throw away, right. So we can actually have like textures in here as well, right."
430480,436720," As you can see, so there is a little bit of a texture in here and stuff like that. So that's what Z-buffer is."
437600,444720," So here they're talking about one-dimensional Z-buffer, which is rather interesting. It's a"
444720,453200," one-dimensional Z-buffer. So, and this is because we are ray casting the walls in a one-dimensional space."
453200,458960," Right, so we have a position of the player, right. So maybe I'm going to start my paint and"
458960,463600," draw this entire thing yet again, right. So I think it's going to be very useful to draw that."
463600,473760," So, okay, let me let me do that. So the way we raycast, so here is the position of the player. I'm"
473760,480560," going to denote it as PP, which stands for the position of the player. Then we have a certain FOV,"
480560,487680," field of view, right. So this is FOV angle, right. And this is a P1 and this is P2, right."
487680,493760," So it has some basically projection plane or nearest clipping plane or something like that,"
493760,500480," whatever you call it, right. So here is an obstacle. And basically from the PP, from the PP,"
500480,506480," we are shooting the rays in all of the directions for each individual pixel colon on the screen."
506480,511760," So this is the screen, by the way. So this is the screen like this."
511760,521840," Right. And then if it hits something, we actually color the column associated with like this specific"
521840,528880," array in a corresponding color. Actually, we put a column from the texture because these things are"
528880,536400," usually textured. So because of that, what we're doing in here, we have like a one-dimensional"
537280,544880," one-dimensional Z buffer, right, which stores the distance to the column of the obstacle we're"
544880,553520," rendering. Since walls are rendered basically in one-dimensional space and the height of the wall"
553520,559440," is sort of guessed based on the distance from the player to the obstacle, we don't really care about"
559440,566320," the second dimension. We only care about the horizontal dimension. So because of that, the distance buffer"
566320,571680," that we're collecting, it's one-dimensional, right. So project your PP to Z buffer."
571680,580480," How am I supposed to have any serious conversation with this chat? I'm very curious."
585440,594800," Anyways, okay. Let's continue projecting our PP. So, okay. So this is, I suppose, what they mean. You do,"
594800,602880," you know, raycasting. And as you raycast for each individual column, you're sort of like saving Z buffer,"
602880,608480," right. You're sort of saving Z buffer. I wonder if we can like right away already implement that. So it"
608480,616000," shouldn't be that hard to implement, I think. So let's go ahead and just for this entire thing implement"
616000,625840," the Z buffer. So we need to go into the game TS. And interestingly, this becomes kind of a part of the"
625840,635680," the state of the game, but the state of the game here is player and the scene, right. It would be nice,"
635680,642720," honestly, to maybe introduce some sort of interface, interface called game. And this is where we're going"
642720,646880," to have the player. This is where we're going to have the player. This is where we're going to have the"
646880,656080," scene like that. And on top of that, we probably could have like a buffer, right, the Z buffer,"
656080,661520," the Z buffer, which is going to be array of numbers or something like that, that we could reuse."
661520,670640," So as of right now, we also pass a lot of things in here, like a back context and back image data and"
670640,680560," so on and so forth. So I'm not really sure. So Z buffer is more like a thing that belongs to the"
680560,688960," display. Right. So we have a lot of things in here, like a 2D canvas, right. So the off screen 2D canvas"
688960,695280," and the back image into which we're rendering all of that. So, and I feel like maybe this kind of stuff"
695280,702720," has to be moved into separate entity that we would call something like display. I think that"
702720,707680," would make more sense because you're rendering the game into the display, right. So let's actually go"
707680,716320," ahead and do that. So, right, interface display. And in here, we're going to have the canvas context"
716320,721200," of the canvas that is visible on the screen. So that's the context of this thing, I think. Clean"
721200,726800," architecture. Yeah. So we're going to be doing clean architecture. So the back context is the"
726800,733440," back canvas into which we sort of buffer and everything. And back image data is the image"
733440,739200," data that stores the actual pixels of this like sort of canvas and stuff like that. Right. So this is what"
739200,746640," we want to have in here. Right. And essentially, we want to get rid of this entire group and replace it"
746640,755280," with just display. Right. So in here, we accept display, delta time, how much time has passed since"
755280,760960," the previous frame, and the state of the game, which is the state of the player and the state of the scene."
760960,768640," Right. So all of the technicalities of rendering should be stored in the display. Right. So all the"
768640,774880," contexts, canvases, buffers, and stuff like that, including zBuffer. Right. Including zBuffer, which is"
774880,779760," going to be an array of numbers. Maybe it would be even better to store it as something like a"
779760,788080," float 32 array or whatever. Right. So because there are things like that in JavaScript, but I don't think"
788080,792560," I want to do it right now. Right. So I think it would be better to just say this is an array of numbers."
792560,797520," Right. Okay. So that will obviously cause compilation errors. Right. And stuff like that. So"
798720,807760," let's go to, if I'm going to 12, 19, I mean, and let me maybe fly check mode this entire thing. Okay."
807760,816560," So does it complain? I don't really see the errors. Let's go to the next flight check next error."
816560,823840," Didn't I just enable, I enabled, but it doesn't really show me errors. Okay. So that should go in here."
824880,830080," Okay. So here in CTX, what we have to do, we have to just do display CTX. Right. So this is a canvas"
830080,838960," size and we just do display CTX. So 520. I'm surprised that this thing doesn't work. Something with the fly"
838960,845760," check disabling backend because can't find suitable init function. Okay. Maybe I just need to restart Linux."
846560,855520," So one day I said that if LSP for TypeScript breaks, I will do nothing. I think the time has come."
855520,862720," I think it finally broke. Right. And I, and I supposed to not do anything about that. Right. So let me see."
862720,870800," And next error. Yeah. So I guess it broke and I'm not supposed to be doing anything about that."
870800,880160," So flight check mode next error. Yeah. So it's not working anymore. Interesting. That's fine. That's fine."
880160,889920," So in here, I suppose one of the things I have to do is query replace CTX with display CTX. Right."
889920,900160," So we can try to do that. So it's going to be that, no, that, no, that, that, that, that, that, that, that."
900160,908480," Okay. So what other things we have in here? 523. So this is the back image data. Right. So let's do"
908480,917040," back image data, replace it with display back image data. Right. So in here, we're going to just"
917040,924560," replace it all like that. So, which also, which is also rather interesting, right? So maybe we should now"
924560,931040," pass, uh, you know, the entirety of the display or to, to these functions. Right. But maybe not. I think"
931040,938720," it's fine to actually put it like that. 527. Okay. So this is back CTX. Right. So, and I'm going to do back"
939360,947600," CTX display back CTX. Right. So let's replace it like that and boom. Uh, all right. So everything is"
947600,956000," compilable except index TS. Right. So it's 97. I said 97. Thank you very much. Uh, okay. So, and then here"
956000,963200," we have all this entire group, right? This entire group of the parameters. We have to replace it with display."
963840,969760," So maybe one of the things we can do in here, by the way, we can create const display, which is just,"
969760,976480," which is just that. I wonder if we can just do things like this in, uh, JavaScript and in TypeScript"
976480,987680," arguments. Um, right. What if I, uh, is not assignable to parameter display. So it's more like 98."
989120,998160," Yeah. So I have to explicitly maybe say that this is a CTX, CTX, then back CTX and back image data. I"
998160,1007040," suppose. Oh, I think I've just forgot to initialize the Z buffer. Right. So Z buffer is supposed to be"
1007040,1015520," empty and that works. That actually works. So it's kind of like, I kind of purely guessed that you can do"
1015520,1019680," this kind of stuff in JavaScript based purely on how Rust works because you can do this kind"
1019680,1026880," of shit in Rust. Right. So yeah, it's kind of useful to know several languages, right? It's useful to know"
1026880,1031920," several languages because you kind of know like a lot of different ideas that other languages may start"
1031920,1038240," adapting and stuff like that. So, uh, yeah. So anyway, let's take a look at the, at the subs,"
1038240,1044480," uh, who subscribed, who subscribed, uh, Trovo is in. Oh, I hope I pronounced your nickname correctly."
1044480,1049040," Thank you for Twitch Prime and Lime XS. Thank you so much for Twitch Prime with the message"
1049040,1055120," at sojing pogging. Uh, CodeCat69. Thank you so much for tier one with the message. It's been nine months."
1055120,1061680," We finally got our Twitch baby. Finally got our Twitch baby. So yeah. Okay. So everything seems to be"
1061680,1066800," compiling. All right. So if I rip, okay. It automatically refreshes, uh, as you can see,"
1066800,1073520," it automatically refreshes, which is kind of cool. Uh, so now, um, what I'm thinking is that we have to"
1073520,1082400," actually allocate, uh, you know, the Z buffer equal to the size of the width. So I keep forgetting how you"
1082400,1089280," allocate array in JavaScript. So let's quickly, um, right. Let's quickly remind, uh, ourselves,"
1089280,1094240," right? So I think it's, it's a, yeah. Okay. So, and then we probably want to fill it with zero."
1094240,1099680," So, all right, let's go ahead and do that. So it's going to be array of the size of, so if it's a bag,"
1099680,1107760," it has to be screen, uh, width, right? So it's a screen width and we just fill this entire thing with, uh, zeros."
1107760,1112960," Does it feel returned that? Yeah, it does return this, right? So which allows us to create this object"
1112960,1120640," and instantaneously, instantaneously in place, modify it. Uh, right. By the way, speaking of this"
1120640,1125840," paradigm in JavaScript, where you create an object and you have a bunch of builder methods that"
1125840,1133040," instantaneously modify that instance and return this so you can chain them. I recently refactored off screen"
1133040,1139520," vector, like to de-vector to be like that, right? So we talked about it, but I actually went ahead and"
1139520,1145600," refactored the vector. Uh, so vector2. So where is that? There we go. So as you can see,"
1145600,1152640," uh, majority of the methods like add, they do not create a new instance anymore. They do not create a"
1152640,1161120," new instance anymore. They actually modify this thing in place and return this. Right. So I tried to minimize"
1161120,1168640," the amount of news used in the vector. And if you do need to create a new instance of the vector, you have"
1168640,1176240," clone, right? So you call clone you, and then you in place modify the instance of that cloned vector."
1176240,1183520," So, and that creates a very interesting situation that, uh, the actual clones become obvious so you can"
1183520,1188560," grab for them. Right. So if I want to optimize performance, I just search for clones. Okay. Where we have"
1188560,1194160," clones in here. Okay. So, uh, here we clone things and then here we just use things in place. If I want"
1194160,1198720," to optimize something, I will probably start from here right now. I don't want to do that. Right. So,"
1198720,1203920," but at least I know like low hanging fruits, what, what to optimize and stuff like that. Right. So,"
1203920,1210480," and as we discussed earlier, you really don't want to create a lot of small objects on each frame,"
1210480,1216080," right? Because the GC starts to chug because of that. Uh, right. So it's actually very useful."
1216080,1226640," And I stole that idea from three JS. Right. So, uh, if you Google up three JS, uh, three JS vector two,"
1226640,1232800," this is literally what they're doing in there. This is literally what they're doing. Um, so this is their"
1232800,1238080," documentation, right? So it's just a documentation website. Uh, and their entire part of them is just"
1238080,1244080," that. So all of the operations here are in place and we can even take a look at the source code. I think"
1244080,1250720," source code is available in here. Right. So it's basically like roughly the clone of the three JS vector."
1251280,1261040," Um, right. So you can see set scalar. Um, so they have clone, uh, just as I, just as I do and add also"
1261040,1264400," just modifies all of these things in place. If you want to read about this kind of thing, I'm going to"
1264400,1270800," copy paste it in here. In fact, I probably going to add it to the description, right? So let me, uh, grab this"
1270800,1277680," entire thing and I'm going to go into the description in here and just append it in here because it was heavily"
1277680,1285440," inspired by that. It was heavily inspired by that. So let's close this entire thing. And, uh, yeah,"
1285440,1294480," so that's what's going on. So we have the Z buffer. We have the Z buffer and now when we're rendering"
1294480,1302320," the walls, uh, we want to fill that Z buffer with the distance. Like, but what distance? The orthogonal"
1302320,1309200," distance, uh, perpendicular distance to each, uh, vertical stripe in one DZ buffer. Yeah. So the,"
1309200,1316080," the deliberately using the word perpendicular, right? Because here you can have two distances."
1316080,1322640," So here is the first distance. It's the distance from the place where you hit to the position of the"
1322640,1328800," player. And if you use that distance for rendering, you're going to end up with a fish eye effect."
1328800,1332800," We can take a look at that. Like, I wonder if I can quickly reproduce this kind of, this kind of thing."
1332800,1342720," Um, so this is the distance that we use if we, so, and this is RGBA, uh, if we replace"
1342720,1351200," this distance with the distance to the, to the player. So this is where we sort of hit."
1352400,1359120," So P, yeah, P is the place where we hit all of that. So what we have to do now, we have to take"
1359120,1367920," the player position, player position, and just take the distance to P. So, um, the cool thing in here is"
1367920,1374000," that no cloning of the vectors occurs in here, right? So everything is computed in place. And if we just"
1374000,1379680," look at that, you will notice that there is a little bit of a fish eye effect. It's so visible,"
1379680,1386000," you can actually see that in here. So it starts to curve in here, right? It starts to curve, uh,"
1386000,1390080," all of this. Yeah. This is actually kind of funny how it's just like warps around and stuff like that."
1390080,1395120," So this is the fish eye effect that I'm talking about, right? So this is the fish eye effect. If you just"
1395120,1402720," use that like distance directly. So because of that, the distance that you must use is orthogonal distance,"
1402720,1410800," actually. So imagine that you have the second, um, you know, plane in here that is parallel to the"
1410800,1417200," projection plane. And instead of using distance to the point, you use the orthogonal distance, which has"
1417200,1424640," like a 90 degree towards that. And that gets rid of the fish eye effect, right? So if you just do"
1424640,1431360," something like this, as you can see, just a second, boom, it got rid of the fisheye effect. We do have"
1431360,1436160," hot reloading, by the way, right? So we implemented that on the previous stream. And that allows me to do"
1436160,1441280," this kind of shit very quickly, relatively quickly. So as you can see, now we have a fisheye effect,"
1441280,1447920," uh, right? So it's very much visible in here. And then I can just swap it around, uh, right? And the"
1447920,1454560," the fisheye effect disappears. Can your C do that? I don't fucking think so, dub dub dub dub dub. Your C is"
1454560,1465040," not a dynamic language. It's very easy in dynamic languages. Yes, says the guy who implemented hot"
1465040,1475840," reloading in C, by the way. Honestly, all of these so-called tech arguments literally look like that for me."
1477680,1482720," they're fucking stupid, right? If you know how computers work, if you know how tech works and"
1482720,1486240," stuff like that, all of these arguments, like this library versus this library, bro,"
1486240,1491760," I can fucking implement this library. I literally don't give a shit. It's just like,"
1491760,1494320," I'm participating in these arguments. It's like, oh my god."
1494320,1503360," What happened to the FPS? That's a good question. I'm streaming."
1505360,1510240," That's what happened. We can try to improve it. Okay. So we can try to improve FPS, uh, specifically"
1510240,1515680," while I'm streaming, I'm going to put 20 in here. So that will actually refresh the entirety of this"
1515680,1521280," thing. So that kind of improved it. Like we can, we can even put 10 in here. Sure. We can probably"
1521280,1530000," even put 10 in here. Now we have 30. Now we have 30. But I mean, it's like, it's, it's still pretty bad."
1530000,1535120," Right. It's still pretty bad. Oh, probably because I also have like my paint. Maybe if I remove my paint,"
1535120,1541520," uh, close my paint, maybe it becomes better. Okay. It actually became better. But I mean, this is too,"
1541520,1546960," too low resolution for my taste, honestly. So let's actually bring it back. So this is fine. Right."
1550960,1558800," So anyways, uh, what we were doing. So we, I was talking that we supposed to actually save in a z-buffer"
1558800,1567680," the perpendicular, perpendicular distance. Per-pen-dic-ular. Per-pen-dic-ular. Right. So that's what we're"
1567680,1575680," supposed to store in there. So let me see. Render walls. And that perpendicular distance is basically this."
1576960,1585440," Yeah. Um, so we're iterating x, as you can see. So that means after we did all of the ray casting and"
1585440,1592240," shoot, uh, what we have to do is just take the display. We don't even have a display. So let's"
1592240,1599760," actually refactor this entire thing to accept the display. Let's go. Um, all right. So, and now,"
1599760,1607920," uh, what I have to do, I have to query place image data with, uh, display, display image data like this."
1607920,1619280," Uh, that's a lot of things in here, but I guess that's fine. Uh, so what are the errors we have in"
1619280,1627760," here? So 3, 84. Ah, it's not really image data. It's supposed to be back image data. Okay. So back image data."
1627760,1634160," Uh, boom. Uh, are you happy now? Yeah, you're happy now. 527. And in here, we just pass the"
1634160,1639760," entirety of the display in here. All right. That's cool. So now we have the entirety of the display."
1639760,1647680," That's fine. That's totally fine. And essentially, so now what I'm doing is I'm taking the display,"
1647680,1658240," the Z buffer and I'm just saying at X, uh, store this specific distance, store this specific distance."
1658240,1665280," Uh, what's funny is that now, um, we always compute that distance regardless of whether we have RGBA or"
1665280,1670560," not RGBA because we need to store it in the Z buffer. And maybe because of that, it kind of makes sense to"
1671200,1679600," reuse it. Uh, so essentially what I can say, we replace V dot Z with that one. So not to replace"
1679600,1686800," that one, but do not recompute it, uh, like all the time. We kind of already cached that Z buffer value."
1686800,1691200," Just like, you know, just keep it. Uh, I think that's, uh, that's a reasonable thing to do in here."
1691760,1698800," So, uh, is it? Okay. It's dead. Let's actually refresh the syntax, just in case. Uh, does it even compile?"
1698800,1708480," Ah, it doesn't even compile. 3388. Hmm. Oof, this one is interesting. So that means we want to compute V and Z"
1708480,1716320," always outside of this entire thing. So that means we're kind of removing it from here. Uh, and we don't"
1716320,1720480," have to do that stuff in here. Okay. So a little bit of optimization, I suppose."
1721360,1724160," Uh, so I guess we can live with that."
1724160,1734080," Okay, cool. Uh, we computed everything in here, but it would be kind of nice to maybe see what's stored"
1734080,1738720," in that specific buffer, right? It will be kind of interesting to see what's stored in that."
1738720,1745920," Um, so let's maybe once we're done finishing the wall, right? So this is where we"
1745920,1750480," rendered the wall. We're going to just print the contents of the Z buffer. So display"
1750960,1757520," display Z buffer and maybe just crash the entire application. Just throw something like stop."
1757520,1763360," Right. So, because I want to see that being displayed in the, in the console. So let's actually open the"
1763360,1769680," console, open the dev tools. So when we, do we have anything in the dev tools? Uh, we should have"
1769680,1775760," something. Okay. So here's the array. Uh, and, uh, I would like to, okay, so this looks fine. And as you can see,"
1775760,1780720," and as you can see, this is 15, which is over the limit."
1780720,1788320," And, uh, that's very interesting. So it doesn't really tell me much. Oh, that's very cool."
1788320,1797040," So it was actually going far, far away up until it stopped at three, right? Up until it stopped at"
1797040,1804160," three. So I suppose this is basically the edge that it hit. It hit this edge. So that means this three"
1804160,1813440," now is growing and then it hit two again. I suppose it hit like this part or something, right? So, uh,"
1813440,1819200," this is the Z buffer, right? So this is the Z buffer and it tells us basically how far or close things"
1819200,1826560," are. Uh, maybe we should actually kind of like somehow display this and I think, um, I don't know,"
1826560,1836000," like overlay it. Uh, so essentially if the value is too big, or it should display it as small, um,"
1836800,1841840," how to say that, a small circle, some sort of a gradient. Yeah, maybe we should show it as a gradient."
1841840,1853920," Maybe we should show it as a gradient. But I don't know how useful knowing this thing will be."
1855040,1864240," Um, so let me, let me actually see. So, okay. So I can already kind of see that it is correct. So I don't"
1864240,1870800," know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. So thank you so much Ormus Buckstar for"
1870800,1874000," Atelman's subscription. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Really appreciate that. That's pretty,"
1874000,1879200," that's pretty, very epic. Okay, cool. So we got a Z buffer. All right, we'll get a Z buffer. Uh,"
1879200,1884240," So what do we do with the Z buffer next? Calculate the distance of each sprite to the player."
1884240,1893040," Okay, so we need to introduce the the notion of the sprite first. Uh, right. Use this distance to store,"
1893040,1901600," to sort the sprites from the furthest away to the closest to the camera. Ah, so they're using this"
1902160,1911760," old technique of just Z sorting. Z sorting. So they're using, uh, this technique of Z sorting. So"
1911760,1918480," essentially you first render a thing that is further away. So the things that are closer are basically"
1918480,1926000," slapped on top. Right. So that's basically what they're using. All right. So, um, and why do you need"
1926000,1933760," one D Z buffer in that same case? Oh, I guess you need it in case a sprite intersects with the wall."
1933760,1940080," Right. So we don't have any Z buffering for the sprites among each other. Right. So the sprites"
1940080,1945280," won't properly like intersect with each other, but they will properly intersect with the walls probably."
1945280,1951520," I don't really know. But anyway, so we just do Z sorting. Right. So we first, uh, render things that are"
1951520,1959280," farther away and then the things that are closed away. Okay. Project the sprite on the camera plane"
1959280,1967040," into D. Uh, sprite on the camera plane into D. Subtract the player position from the sprite position,"
1967040,1971920," then multiply the result with the inverse of the two by two camera matrix."
1971920,1980960," Ooh. Project the sprite on the camera plane into D. Oh, and then colon. And this is the"
1980960,1987680," explanation of how you project the sprite on the camera plane. Subtract the player's position from"
1987680,1995760," the sprite position. Okay. Then multiply the result with the inverse of the two by two camera matrix."
1995760,2004160," Okay. So they're using some sort of a two by two projection matrix. So the two by two camera matrix."
2004160,2009360," I don't really know it. I don't have any matrices in here because I just like project things manually."
2009360,2015200," So I suppose what they're saying is that sprites are supposed to be projected"
2015200,2020640," as easy. Right. As you would do them in a proper 3D, I suppose."
2020640,2026320," Oh, I think they even say that in here. The technique used to draw the sprites is totally different from"
2026320,2031600," the ray casting technique. Instead, it works very similar to how sprites are drawn in 3D engines with"
2031600,2036640," projections. Like in the points and sprites and moving articles. Only we have to do the projection"
2036640,2043280," only into D and some extra techniques to combine it with the ray casting that is used. Okay."
2045280,2050240," I see what is going on in here. I see what is going on in here. Right. So they're projecting it like that."
2050240,2057600," So, okay. So you're projecting it on the screen. Right. So you're projecting it on the screen."
2057600,2063760," Then you calculate the size of the sprite on the screen, both x and y direction, by using the"
2063760,2071920," perpendicular distance. Okay. I think I know what they mean by that. Right. So we compute the size of the wall"
2071920,2078880," using the perpendicular distance. Right. So which is essentially, this is the perpendicular distance,"
2078880,2083040," which is stored in the z-buffer. Right. And we divide it by the height of the screen. And that's"
2083040,2091120," basically the size of the wall. Right. So that kind of explains it. Okay. So draw the sprite, vertical stripe"
2091120,2097600," by vertical stripe. Don't draw the vertical stripe if the distance is further away than the"
2098480,2104080," one z-buffer of the walls of the current stripe. Yeah. This is exactly what I was talking about."
2104080,2110480," Right. So essentially, sprites don't really properly intersect with each other. Right. Because of that,"
2110480,2116800," we're using z-sorting. But they properly intersect with the walls. Right. So this is sort of the limitation"
2116800,2122800," of the engine that we're going to have. All right. Makes sense. Draw the vertical stripe pixel by pixel."
2122800,2132000," Make sure there is an inverse color or all sprites would be rectangles. Draw the vertical stripe pixel by pixel. Make"
2132000,2140800," sure there is an inverse color or all sprites would be rectangles. I didn't get the point of this thing,"
2140800,2149360," but okay. Vertical stripe pixel by pixels. Make sure there is an inverse color or all sprites would be"
2149360,2159280," rectangles. Invisible. Oh my god. I forgot how to read them. I'm sorry. Okay. Invisible rectangles or all would be..."
2159280,2164000," Okay. So that makes sense. Because they usually have like a background. The alpha. Yeah. So don't forget to support alpha."
2166880,2175440," Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. All right. So we get some subs. Thank you so much. Droko87 for"
2175440,2181440," Twitch Prime. With a message. Hello, Mr. Zudin. Hello, Mr. Droko. So. Shinta42. Thank you so much for"
2181440,2188080," Twitch Prime. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The alpha. The alpha color. The sigma color."
2190400,2204960," Sorry. Anyways. So I guess that makes sense. Sort of. But I wonder what is this 2D 2x2 camera matrix?"
2204960,2213440," Okay. So how to project the sprite on the screen is explained in full 3D rendering mathematics."
2215120,2220960," with 3D matrices and camera. For true 3D rasterizer or raytracer 3D engines."
2220960,2229200," Engines. And not explained here in the raycaster tutorial. However, here it's done in 2D and no fancy"
2229200,2236080," camera classes used. To bring... So we don't use any OOP apparently. No fancy classes or anything like that."
2236080,2242560," To bring the sprite's coordinates to camera space, first subtract the player position from the sprite"
2242560,2251520," position. Cool. Then you have the position of the sprite relative to the player. Cool. Then it has to be"
2251520,2259360," rotated so that the direction is relative to the player. Okay. The camera can also be skewed and has a"
2259360,2266240," certain size so it isn't really a rotation but a transformation. The transformation is done by"
2266240,2273760," multiplying the relative position of the sprite with the inverse of the camera matrix. The camera matrix is"
2273760,2285440," in our case, plane x, plane y. I have no idea what it is. Dear x, dear y. I kind of have an idea what that"
2285440,2289760," is. I suppose it's a direction of the player where the player is looking but what the f is a plane x and"
2289760,2295920," plane y. It's probably explained in some other chapters but I didn't read them. And the inverse"
2295920,2304240," of the two by two matrix is very easy to calculate. Right. So you just have that. Okay. So is there any"
2304240,2309360," demonstration of what is plane x and plane y? Like where exactly?"
2311600,2317840," Like I need a picture. Just a point. Where is the plane x and plane y? And I can't tell you where it is."
2317840,2321120," Right. So we can take a look at the previous things."
2321120,2330240," Plane x and plane y is the screen. Oh, okay. So this is the previous chapter. This is the"
2330240,2334240," chapter two. Floor and ceiling. I'm going to search for plane x."
2335280,2337440," Did you do rest a version of the camera plane?"
2337440,2348560," Okay. So there is nothing particularly useful in here. Maybe there is something in here."
2348560,2352000," So where did we talk about plane x? I think something..."
2352000,2360080," Okay. So here is the direction. And okay. So here is the plane as well."
2363680,2374320," So they have position, direction, plus plane. Probably the near plane. But... Oh, okay."
2374320,2379360," So..."
2379360,2382800," I don't know."
2382800,2393200," I don't know. I need picture and just like arrow. This is plane x on the... This is what I need."
2393200,2397840," Like this kind of stuff is not going to cut it. Like I don't understand. Unless it's just like a huge picture."
2397840,2401920," Okay. Here is that, that, that, that, that. Go. This is what I need."
2401920,2404880," But this tutorial is not going to give me."
2404880,2410240," Unfortunately, brav. Unfortunately, brav is not going to give me."
2410240,2415360," The code presented below uses a small list of objects instead of a map."
2418880,2425520," So this is a bad explanation. It's easier for me to maybe figure, figure out all of that stuff myself."
2425520,2429680," All right. I think, I think it would be easier for me to just figure out all of that shit myself."
2429680,2437200," Instead of just doing this inverse matrix. And matrix, matrices is like ultimate gatekeeping."
2438160,2445040," Because in reality, matrix does not explain anything. And this is the thing. It's just like,"
2445040,2450080," I already ranted about it. Like, I remember, like, I really vividly remember that I already ranted about"
2450080,2457120," it. It's just like all the tutorials is that, brav, here's the black box. Just use it. Don't think about"
2457120,2462720," it because you dummy dum dum. Don't look into the box. Just use it. Just multiply a vector by this matrix."
2462720,2465280," Smarter people than you figured it out. Shut up. Shut up."
2465280,2469200," So it's always like that because the matrix is just"
2469200,2476000," operations that you can explain the separations, right? They make sense. They have meaning, right?"
2476000,2481760," But the matrix is just a way to encode and compress the separation into a single matrix."
2481760,2486640," And for some reason, people who give you that matrix thinks that it's sufficient enough explanation."
2486640,2492320," It's just like, here's the black box. Problem solved. And it's like, it's no better than just saying like,"
2492320,2501520," use this library. It's just like, it's really annoying. It's really, it's really fucking annoying."
2501520,2506960," It's really fucking annoying. But I am. But I like to understand things."
2509280,2513440," So you're assuming people writing this tutorial know the math behind it. Yes, I do."
2513440,2519200," Because why the fuck are you writing a thing, right? If you don't understand it. So that's,"
2519200,2524000," I think that's a fair assumption, right? So it's a fair assumption. Like you're trying to share your"
2524000,2529840," knowledge. You don't say explicitly that you don't know how to use this thing. So I, I assume that you"
2529840,2534000," understand it and can even reinvent it and reproduce it. But you don't do that."
2535440,2540800," I don't know why. Maybe you, you hate me. Maybe. So, uh, yeah."
2540800,2548800," So, yes, yes, yes. I think I need to make a small break, by the way. I think I need to make a small"
2548800,2554960," break because I already started for one hour and I ran out of water. I created React app. Create React app."
2555760,2565600," Right. So, and yeah. So let's go ahead and do that. So what's funny is that I think, um, I think it's"
2565600,2577920," actually very easy to, to project. So let me, let me, let me just do my paint. All right. So essentially, um,"
2579360,2592160," Brush. Thank you. Okay. So here's the PP. So this is the PP. Uh, here we have P1, right? So, and P2,"
2592160,2598880," they denote the boundaries of this projection thingy. So this is the boundaries of the projection thingy."
2599520,2607840," Uh, you have a sprite. All right. So you have a sprite SP. Isn't it basically fucking find this point?"
2607840,2618160," Isn't that basically what the fuck it is? I think, I think it is. I think it actually is. All right. So"
2620720,2628800," And for determining the size, for determining the size, we're just like projecting this thing, uh,"
2628800,2635040," like that, which is actually easier, honestly. Right. So which is supposed to be something like this."
2635040,2642960," Right. So you just find this point. Actually, no, no, no, no, no, no. So, uh, we have to find these distance,"
2642960,2649680," right? So we have the real distance and the perpendicular distance. And this is the one"
2649680,2656480," that we use to determine the size of the sprite that we're rendering. But ultimately, um, the position,"
2656480,2661840," the place where we're rendering this entire thing is determined by this thing. So we just need to find"
2661840,2669360," the intersection. Okay. Um, uh, starting measuring his PP size on the string. Okay. Let's make a small break."
2669360,2676080," All right. So, uh, I think I understand what the tutorial wants. Uh, it's actually rather interesting."
2676080,2682720," So let me demonstrate you. Let me demonstrate you. Uh, let me grab, let me grip my, uh, you know,"
2682720,2691040," tablet and, uh, maybe I'm going to actually erase this kind of stuff and let me see. So we do have the"
2691040,2698240," direction. Uh, can I just have a brighter color? Thank you very much. Right. We have the direction"
2699200,2705840," and we also kind of know the direction to the sprite, to the position of the sprite in there."
2705840,2714800," Right. And that forms effectively the right triangle. And where is the right triangle? Here comes the"
2714800,2723120," trigonometry. And we already know how to do the fork and trigonometry, mate. So essentially, uh, we may say,"
2723120,2730480," we may say that these things are like, you know, I don't know, one dimensional vectors, though I'm not"
2730480,2742800," quite sure about that part. Right. I'm not quite sure about that part. So if the direction is one dimensional,"
2742800,2749120," right, if the direction is one dimensional, maybe we can find the dot product between the direction"
2749120,2759680," and this thing, right. So there's this vector and this vector. And, um, so let's actually think,"
2759680,2769600," so let's call it D. This is dear. And this is more like, um, I call it the speed, but the speed is a"
2769600,2777680," point. So, uh, maybe I'm going to call it SP minus PP. Right. So we're going to say SP minus PP,"
2778800,2785600," minus PP. And we say, okay, let's actually find the dot product between that and direction. Uh,"
2785600,2795040," and the dot product, as far as I know, right, it relates cosine, uh, of this, um, of this angle."
2795040,2803200," Right. So it's basically cosine, uh, alpha. So it's a cosine alpha multiplied by the length of this thing"
2803200,2810960," and the length of this thing, if I remember correctly. Right. So length of that, um, you know, SP minus PP,"
2810960,2818880," SP minus PP and the length of deer. But here's an interesting part. The length of deer is equal to one."
2818880,2827120," So we can kind of like forget about that. So it's only this, right. It is only this, which is totally fine."
2828640,2836160," which is totally fine. So yeah. So the only thing we want to do in here is probably maybe"
2836160,2846320," divide this whole thing, right. The dot product between these things by, um, SP minus PP."
2847360,2852880," Those are doing some advanced math. Bro, it's a school math. At least in Russia, this is considered"
2852880,2859120," like a school math. I'm not sure about the rest of the world. Right. So, but I remember doing this"
2859120,2864880," math sheet in actually in middle school, right? It's not even high school math. It's a middle school math."
2864880,2870720," Uh, so sixth grade. I'm not sure about the sixth grade, honestly, but"
2870720,2881200," when I was in school, the last math topic in high school that we had was linear algebra, actually."
2882240,2890400," More like a half of the linear algebra. Uh, so we start learning linear algebra in like the last, uh, you"
2890400,2898240," know, in the last year of high school. And then as the first, like a year of university, this is sort"
2898240,2906240," of the first math topic that we, uh, study. So it's like stops at high school and continues in university."
2906240,2911280," Right. So it's kind of like designed like that. Um, so half of that you learn in high school and"
2911280,2918560," the half of that in university. Uh, linear algebra is, yeah, it's matrices. Right. So we, we do study"
2918560,2927920," matrices in high school. Um, bloody comments, uh, touching people with, but we're not communists"
2927920,2935440," anymore. Like why people assume that we're still communists. In fact, nobody even fucking wants back to"
2935440,2944880," communists. Um, a lot of people want back to Soviet Union, but that does not necessarily mean that they"
2944880,2952720," want communism, but that's already besides the point. Uh, wants to call me forever. So you say people can't"
2952720,2960960," change and improve. So that means I can apply that logic to you as well and ban you and assume that"
2960960,2967840," you're never going to improve. That's a dangerous rhetoric you're using in here. It's a very dangerous"
2967840,2977840," one. So, because it works both way. Remember that. Works both way. Uh, so, we can divide that and we"
2977840,2985440," have a cosine, right? So what is a cosine? Does anybody remember? Uh, does anybody remember? So what is a cosine?"
2987280,3013040," So, definition of a cosine. So, adjacent to hypotenuse, okay. Adjacent, aha. So, we know that cosine of alpha, cosine of alpha, adjacent, which is the deer, right?"
3013040,3039860," So, this is the deer. To hypotenuse, which is this entire thing. So, what if we consider this right triangle, righteous triangle, right? This righteous triangle. We know this, the length of this thing. This is literally nearest clipping plane."
3039860,3053080," So, this is the nearest clipping plane. And it's adjacent thing. Divided by the length of this thing, which we can call b. So, it's basically b, right?"
3054240,3068720," All right. So, we can quite easily compute cosine, right? So, because as you can see, you basically divided it, right? So, we can maybe even erase it. So, knowing all of that stuff, we can compute cosine of alpha."
3068960,3084300," But we also know that cosine of alpha is this relationship. We know the NCP value. We know the NCP value. That means we can divide by NCP value, right?"
3084380,3098320," And that kind of get rid of that. And we have an inverse of b. But what's interesting is that I think it would be easier to just invert this thing. And you effectively end up with b over NCP, b over NCP."
3098320,3115880," And you just multiply by NCP. So, effectively, you do something like that. NCP, right? So, and that gets rid of that. And you end up with b, right? You end up with b, basically."
3116320,3134220," So, that's pretty cool. So, when you can employ all of that stuff to find the length of this thing. As soon as you find the length of this thing, you know this point instantly."
3134220,3139680," You know what I'm talking about? You know what I'm talking about? Like, you instantly know this point."
3141080,3151860," You know the direction. You know the direction. Because the direction is basically that SP minus PP. Normalize that. SP minus PP. Normalize that."
3151860,3158980," And then multiply by b. And you get exactly this value. And you can find b by just following this math a little bit in here."
3158980,3163720," So, does it make sense? Does it make sense? I think it makes sense. So, yeah."
3163720,3170400," And I suppose this is what matrix encodes. I feel like that's what matrix encodes."
3171080,3178140," And finding this thing is also relatively easy, right? So, we already kind of know how to do that."
3178140,3182140," We've already done that before. It's also kind of related to direction and whatnot."
3182140,3184140," But, yeah."
3184140,3189620," So, the more interesting thing would be, for example, when..."
3189620,3193960," What if this thing is completely outside of the field of view? How do you fucking render that?"
3195020,3199060," You have to take into account these kind of situations, right?"
3199060,3200860," You have to take into account these kind of situations."
3200860,3204280," So, yeah."
3204280,3209780," When the angle between these two things is bigger than FOV and it's completely outside."
3209780,3215140," But, to be fair, maybe it is not that difficult to find."
3215140,3221620," And so, the projection point effectively will be kind of outside of the range between P1 and P2."
3221620,3226640," Because what you're going to be doing, you're probably going to be doing inverse lerp, right?"
3226640,3228960," So, your point is supposed to be between these two things."
3228960,3230580," So, you'll have to do inverse lerp."
3230580,3234320," And that will be, you know, outside of this entire range."
3237140,3240720," So, outside of the field of view, you don't render, right?"
3240720,3241720," Yeah, you don't render."
3241720,3246140," But, to be fair, maybe a point somewhere is outside of a field of view."
3246140,3250500," But then you see a little bit of it, a little bit of the sprite in here."
3250500,3252660," So, you kind of need to render part of it."
3252660,3254980," So, yeah."
3254980,3257920," Right now, we can just, like, render everything."
3257920,3264240," And, if a stripe that we're trying to render on a screen appears outside of the screen,"
3264240,3265580," we just, like, don't render it."
3265580,3269300," So, it naturally, like, works out the way we want it to work out."
3269300,3270800," So, yeah."
3270800,3272460," That's basically the math."
3272460,3273760," My math."
3273760,3274920," Right."
3274920,3277820," So, not based on the matrices or anything like that."
3277820,3280200," But, I feel like the matrix kind of encodes that."
3280200,3285000," So, we can try to read the explanation."
3286940,3291660," So, they're saying that you need to, yeah, subtract the player position from this sprite."
3291660,3293700," In our case, we actually do the opposite thing."
3293700,3295280," Right."
3295280,3295600," But, anyway."
3295600,3304820," So, if anything, the experience showed me that it's better to rely on your own reasoning"
3304820,3307840," rather than the tutorial itself."
3307840,3312900," It's better not to follow this specific tutorial, like, letter to letter."
3312900,3315160," Just use it as an inspiration."
3315160,3316760," Just get ideas."
3316940,3317880," From this tutorial."
3317880,3320200," And try to figure them out yourself."
3320200,3321600," That is actually way better."
3321600,3322760," Because you understand."
3322760,3325800," You will understand each individual thing in here."
3325800,3326120," Right."
3326120,3327900," So, which will give you more control."
3327900,3328760," Right."
3328760,3333380," But, if you just follow this entire thing mindlessly, you may get somewhere."
3333380,3335400," But, you don't understand how this thing works."
3335400,3336420," It's kind of useless."
3336420,3337500," Because, you can't control it."
3337500,3339400," You can't control things that you don't understand."
3339400,3340400," You can't modify them."
3340880,3343520," And, being able to modify things is very crucial for me."
3343520,3343800," Right."
3343800,3345360," So, because, like, yeah."
3345360,3347080," If you can modify it, I own it."
3347080,3350480," So, let's take a look at the subs."
3350480,3351940," Some people subscribed."
3351940,3353500," A lot of subs today, actually."
3354320,3355900," So, right."
3355900,3357200," Fire, I own 95."
3357200,3358240," Thank you so much for Twitch Prime."
3358240,3359320," With a message, trigonometry."
3359320,3360040," Craig Gossam."
3360040,3360840," Trigonometry, indeed."
3360840,3362260," Trigonometry is actually kind of fun."
3362260,3365660," I want to maybe refresh it."
3365660,3368680," Because, like, the last time I learned it a long time ago."
3368680,3369100," All right."
3369100,3374160," So, it's kind of embarrassing how little trigonometry I actually remember."
3374840,3376820," Anonymous Gifter, thank you so much for what you want."
3376820,3378120," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
3378120,3380840," For fuck's sake."
3380840,3383560," People."
3383560,3384620," People."
3384620,3388560," Don't make fun of an old man."
3388560,3389300," Okay."
3389300,3394520," He's old and tired."
3394520,3398020," He should probably be retired."
3398020,3400800," Don't make fun of old men."
3400800,3402140," So."
3404840,3406940," Any recent updates on trigonometry last few years?"
3406940,3407700," That's a good question."
3407700,3408140," I don't know."
3408140,3410980," I haven't looked into updates."
3410980,3415780," Any math influencers can get me up to speed."
3415780,3418720," Can read some articles for me."
3418720,3422200," So I know what's the latest hot stuff in trigonometry today."
3422200,3424280," So."
3424280,3426180," What are we going to be doing?"
3426180,3428380," So, we probably need to introduce the notion of a sprite."
3428380,3428940," Right."
3428940,3431660," So, maybe let's introduce some sort of an interface."
3431660,3433000," Interface."
3434840,3441700," So, what's going to be the four-point sprite name?"
3441700,3443980," What's going to be the four-point sprite?"
3443980,3449160," I suppose the sprite is going to be something that I can have an access to pixel to."
3449160,3453260," So, I suppose it's supposed to have some sort of image data."
3453260,3453820," Right."
3453880,3455900," So, that's one thing I can say for sure."
3455900,3457460," Image data."
3457460,3458120," Okay."
3458120,3458980," Cool."
3458980,3462600," Another thing sprite has is probably position."
3462600,3466440," So, back to two."
3466440,3468060," So, it does have position."
3468060,3471040," Anything else?"
3472800,3477320," So, another thing that sprite is probably going to have is its height."
3477320,3478120," Right."
3478120,3479700," Where exactly it is positioned."
3479700,3479960," Right."
3479960,3481160," So, yeah."
3481160,3483560," So, right now it's going to be probably in mid-air."
3483560,3484580," Right."
3484580,3485880," It's going to be in mid-air."
3485880,3490160," But, I think it should be in 3D space."
3490160,3491720," It should be in 3D space."
3491720,3493240," And, there are some examples in here."
3493340,3494380," Like, for example, this thing."
3494380,3500340," Well, I mean, you can basically create a sprite that just has a space above it."
3500340,3504560," So, it appears just, you know, standing on the floor."
3504560,3505540," Right."
3505540,3507320," It just appears standing on the floor."
3507320,3510200," Let's put it back on the ground."
3510200,3510900," Oh, okay."
3510900,3513800," So, all right."
3513800,3514140," All right."
3514140,3521040," So, maybe they have some sort of a parameter for some of the sprites to sort of like them, to move them down or whatnot."
3521040,3521400," Yeah."
3521400,3521780," Okay."
3522500,3524100," So, it will be interesting to actually read all that."
3524100,3526500," So, there's also transparency."
3526500,3527500," So, they're blending."
3527500,3528500," Oh, my God."
3528500,3530220," Look at that advanced shit."
3530220,3531220," The alpha blending."
3531220,3532380," What the fuck?"
3532380,3534740," What the fuck is this engine?"
3534740,3536360," What the fuck is this engine?"
3536360,3537180," Holy shit."
3537180,3537680," Anyway."
3537680,3539800," So, all right."
3539800,3543280," We're going to have some sprites in here."
3543280,3547080," So, I suppose, let's just basically say sprites."
3547080,3549380," And, in here, it's going to be just an array of a sprite."
3549380,3549940," Right."
3549940,3551400," So, this is an array of a sprite."
3552400,3553500," Okay."
3553500,3554400," Okay."
3554400,3557780," And so, if we take a look at the compilation Arrows."
3557780,3559540," The compilation Arrows."
3559540,3561840," It's a 1, 3."
3561840,3563220," And, yeah."
3563220,3564720," So, here we don't really have sprites."
3564720,3567080," So, let's actually initialize some sprites."
3567080,3568440," Shall we?"
3568440,3569780," Shall we?"
3569780,3570400," Shall we?"
3570400,3570980," Shall we?"
3571500,3572920," So, here is the scene."
3572920,3574540," Here is the player."
3574540,3577040," Maybe sprites should be part of the scene."
3577040,3580880," I have a strange feeling that maybe sprites should be part of the scene."
3581520,3582560," If you think about it."
3582560,3584240," If you actually think about it."
3584240,3586160," All right."
3586160,3589900," So, let me find interface scene."
3589900,3591940," So, there are walls."
3591940,3593660," Width and height."
3596660,3597260," It could be."
3597260,3598760," It doesn't really matter that much."
3598760,3600200," Okay."
3600200,3601180," So, it's going to be const."
3601180,3602920," Sprites."
3602920,3605580," And, it's just an array of things."
3605580,3610000," So, sprites is implicit any."
3610260,3613060," So, let's actually say that it's going to be a sprite."
3613060,3614660," Which is a game sprite."
3614660,3615520," And, maybe."
3615520,3616740," Yeah."
3616740,3617120," I already."
3617120,3617820," No."
3617820,3618660," I didn't export it."
3618660,3620060," Interface sprite."
3620060,3622300," Let's export this entire thing."
3622300,3623800," So, it's visible in here."
3623800,3625300," And."
3625300,3627140," 48."
3627140,3629980," Game sprite."
3629980,3633760," Cannot find namespace game."
3633760,3635680," Really."
3635680,3638200," You can't just do it like that."
3638200,3638860," In an array."
3639580,3640680," That is bizarre."
3640680,3641420," Even though."
3641420,3642920," Like, here is the namespace."
3642920,3644940," Are you trying to tell me that."
3644940,3647260," I actually have to do something like."
3647260,3648480," You know."
3648480,3649620," Type."
3649620,3650860," Sprite."
3650860,3654040," And, then just use sprite in here."
3654040,3655620," Is that what you're trying to tell me?"
3655620,3659280," Cannot find namespace game."
3659280,3663940," Am I going fucking crazy, meach?"
3663940,3666460," I feel like I'm going fucking crazy."
3666460,3667880," But, anyway."
3667880,3668200," Maybe."
3668200,3669280," Maybe I just have to."
3669400,3671420," I just have to do something like this."
3671420,3671960," All right."
3671960,3673620," So, and in terms of image data."
3673620,3674520," Let's say that."
3674520,3676600," This is going to be type script."
3676600,3677140," Right."
3677140,3678440," So, this is a type script."
3678440,3680720," Image data."
3680720,3682580," Type of game."
3682580,3682820," Yeah."
3682820,3685000," Probably have to do something like type of game or whatever."
3686460,3687720," So, image data type script."
3687720,3693860," So, image data type script and position is going to be, I don't know, maybe new vector 00, something like that."
3693860,3694720," Is it going to be working?"
3694720,3695540," Is it going to be twerking?"
3695540,3696200," Cannot find."
3696200,3696460," Okay."
3696460,3698040," So, this has to be a game."
3698040,3699560," Are you happy now?"
3700400,3701400," Come on."
3701400,3701620," Come on."
3701620,3704220," There's another file to provide a sprite."
3704220,3706020," Image data."
3706020,3706320," Oh."
3706320,3712040," So, type script is apparently is either image data or RGBA."
3712040,3713380," This is so."
3713380,3714080," Oh, okay."
3714080,3714700," I see why."
3717240,3717560," Okay."
3717560,3718280," I see why."
3718280,3720940," Okay."
3720940,3725420," So, let's get rid of this sketch."
3725420,3725680," Right."
3725680,3730960," So, essentially, what I'm doing in here, if I can't load this entire thing, I just use RGBA instead of it."
3730960,3734020," So, because of that, it's either image data or RGBA."
3734020,3736520," But, right now, it's kind of breaking this entire thing."
3736520,3738260," So, I think I'm going to just remove that."
3738260,3740120," And now it compiles."
3740120,3740380," Okay."
3740380,3741760," So, that would compiles."
3741760,3744620," Goddamn type scripts."
3744620,3745360," Bravo."
3745360,3745920," Bravo."
3745920,3746980," Goddamn type script."
3747160,3750140," I want to have, like, an interesting sprite somewhere."
3750140,3758520," So, just, like, you know, small little blip thing that I could use for different stuff."
3758520,3761300," So, let me actually maybe go to the open game part."
3761300,3767420," So, okay."
3767420,3770120," Effect a spark."
3770120,3772860," Spark sprite."
3772860,3775220," No, no."
3775220,3776980," I want to have some sort of a spark."
3777080,3778880," So, there's sparks."
3778880,3780440," Okay."
3780440,3781360," So, there's a fire."
3781360,3786000," So, this is..."
3786000,3787380," Is that the entire of it?"
3787380,3789060," Oh, okay."
3789060,3790620," All right."
3790620,3791760," So, this is actually a gif."
3791760,3792460," This looks cool."
3792460,3792920," I like it."
3792920,3794440," All right."
3794440,3798840," So, let's download this entire thing and take a look at what we have in here."
3799720,3802840," So, assets, images will already have a folder for open game art."
3802840,3804100," Right."
3804100,3808200," So, I'm going to put this thing and I'm going to download this stuff in here."
3808200,3811440," It's taking some time."
3811440,3817220," But, to be fair, I should actually get this thing."
3817920,3822540," So, this is the original URL, right?"
3822540,3827000," So, this is the original URL and this is the name of the archive that we have in here."
3827000,3829060," So, let me see what's inside of it."
3829060,3829380," Okay."
3829380,3831060," So, sparks."
3831060,3832500," Sparks."
3832500,3833640," And let's open this stuff."
3833640,3834460," Let's move it in here."
3834860,3836300," I'm going to open this kind of thing."
3836300,3838160," Blend?"
3838160,3840680," Dude."
3840680,3842460," What the fuck is this?"
3842460,3844720," Why is that a blender URL?"
3844720,3853860," How on earth would you guess that this is a blend?"
3853860,3858100," This is not what I need."
3858100,3858940," I need 2D."
3858940,3861880," All right."
3861880,3863940," So, I don't know."
3864260,3867180," Like a fire, like magic effect."
3867180,3869520," 3D."
3869520,3871360," This is what I want."
3871360,3872660," I should have actually done that earlier."
3872660,3873220," Right."
3873220,3874120," So, that's what I want."
3874120,3875160," These kind of things."
3875160,3877080," Yeah."
3877080,3878340," That's pretty cool."
3878340,3879780," So, there's a water effect."
3879780,3880520," Water."
3880520,3881920," Water."
3881920,3885760," So, let's take a look at that."
3885760,3887540," Water magic effect."
3887540,3890460," And let's just download this thing."
3890460,3892800," Save that."
3892800,3894080," And wget."
3894260,3895200," This thing."
3895200,3895900," Boom."
3895900,3898780," Water effect."
3898780,3900380," Okay."
3900380,3901460," So, what do we have in here?"
3901460,3904600," Goddamn Windows users."
3904600,3906480," Create the root folder."
3906480,3909740," Smh my age."
3909740,3911600," Smh my age, brother."
3911600,3913100," Smh my age."
3913100,3913380," Okay."
3913380,3915300," So, what do we have?"
3915300,3915940," Water."
3917200,3921240," Yo, they even, they are basically like a self-contained things."
3921240,3922600," Brother."
3922600,3924820," This is so goddamn cool."
3924820,3925880," This is such a cool effect."
3925880,3926140," Okay."
3926140,3927040," So, what all?"
3927040,3928940," What all?"
3928940,3931700," Oh, man."
3931700,3932580," I love this shit."
3932580,3933440," All right."
3933440,3936340," So, what a four looks cool."
3937340,3938420," So, what else?"
3938420,3939580," Like, 0.3."
3939580,3940940," Ooh."
3940940,3942740," Ooh."
3942740,3945320," Damn, bruv."
3945320,3946080," Bruv."
3946080,3946400," Damn."
3946400,3948060," Imagine shooting this shit."
3948060,3950700," Like, shooting all that."
3950700,3952220," Damn."
3953160,3953740," All right."
3953740,3956160," So, credits."
3956160,3956880," Okay."
3956880,3958000," I saved all of that."
3958000,3960540," And it's more like, what's the name of the archive?"
3960540,3962200," What's the name?"
3962200,3963040," Water effect."
3963040,3965180," So, it's a water effect zip."
3965180,3965880," All right."
3965880,3968960," Water bending."
3968960,3970120," 05."
3970120,3970980," What is 05?"
3970980,3972460," This one is kind of."
3972460,3973320," Ooh."
3973320,3974560," It's like a."
3974560,3975600," It's a react."
3975600,3977460," Look at that."
3977460,3978560," This is react."
3978560,3981140," It's kind of weird react."
3981140,3982800," Anyways."
3983480,3985980," So, let's go ahead into the index.ts."
3985980,3988580," And maybe load this."
3988580,3989240," As."
3989240,3993180," So, what we're going to do is just load image data."
3993180,3994480," Assets."
3994480,3995880," Assets."
3995880,3996900," Images."
3996900,3999440," Open game art."
3999440,4000540," Open game art."
4000540,4002080," And what is it fucking called?"
4002080,4002420," What?"
4002420,4002760," Yeah."
4002760,4004060," So, it's a 05."
4004060,4006580," 05."
4006580,4007680," This thing."
4007680,4008440," There we go."
4008440,4011960," And we're going to just call it water."
4012360,4014000," All right."
4014000,4017260," And in terms of sprites, it's going to be just water."
4017260,4025040," So, the position could be somewhere, maybe at the player's position, but not 100% sure."
4025040,4032660," So, here we kind of have this sort of thing."
4032840,4040600," So, if I remove this column, we're going to have an interesting situation."
4040600,4049620," So, essentially, we have four pillars, four walls in here."
4050160,4053360," So, I want to place this sprite somewhere here."
4053360,4055460," I want to place this sprite somewhere here."
4055460,4058320," The size of the cell is one by one."
4058320,4059940," One by one."
4059940,4060840," Like this."
4060840,4067820," So, and if I wanted to place in the center of this thing, I think it's a one and a half and one and a half."
4067820,4069740," Roughly."
4071180,4073400," Roughly one and a half and one and a half."
4073400,4074480," Like this."
4074480,4076700," So, that's a pretty good position, I think."
4076700,4078860," That's a pretty good position."
4078860,4083180," So, okay."
4083180,4085140," There's no compilation errors."
4085140,4086020," There's nothing."
4086020,4087840," And everything looks Gucci."
4087840,4089140," Everything looks Tamaguchi."
4089400,4089600," Okay."
4089600,4090760," Let's go into the game TS."
4090760,4093260," So, here we have the sprites."
4093260,4097700," And one of the things we probably have to do, we have to introduce a function that renders the sprites."
4097700,4097980," Right."
4097980,4098960," The render sprites."
4098960,4100740," It accepts the display."
4100740,4101860," Right."
4101860,4103380," So, it accepts the single display."
4103380,4106160," And it probably just accepts the sprites."
4106160,4107500," Nothing particularly special."
4107500,4107840," Right."
4107840,4108700," So, it's going to be a sprite."
4108700,4110460," Cool."
4110460,4115680," And it is supposed to be called, according to the recipe in here."
4115680,4116000," Right."
4116000,4118880," So, in the article."
4118880,4124280," It's supposed to be called, after we're done with floors, ceilings, walls, and so on and so forth."
4124280,4124620," Right."
4124620,4125440," Render sprites."
4125440,4127500," Display."
4127500,4128960," Sprites."
4128960,4131480," So, here are sprites."
4131480,4133060," Okay."
4133060,4136520," So, we're going to be iterating them."
4136520,4138240," So, you're supposed to sort the sprites."
4138240,4140420," I don't really want to be sorting them right now."
4140420,4140740," Right."
4140740,4143560," I'm more concerned with actually putting them on the screen."
4143560,4145220," Because we have only one sprite."
4145580,4147480," So, we don't have to be concerned with all that."
4147480,4147700," Right."
4147700,4149120," So, it doesn't really matter that much."
4149120,4150920," So, I'm going to put it to do."
4150920,4154060," Z sort the sprites."
4154060,4155480," Z sort the sprites."
4155480,4159120," And what we're going to do is just going to look through the sprites."
4159120,4163060," Can you do something like const sprite of sprites?"
4163060,4165040," Is that a good thing to do?"
4165040,4165880," Is that how we do that?"
4165880,4167120," I think that's how we do that."
4167120,4169080," So, yeah."
4169080,4171420," Now, we get a very interesting thing."
4172420,4176360," Since we're rendering, we're projecting all the stuff."
4176360,4178880," We need to know the position of the camera, direction, and stuff like that."
4178880,4182120," So, we also need to get the player."
4182120,4183400," So, this is the player."
4183400,4185240," So, render sprites."
4185240,4189240," Here, we're supposed to pass the player in here too."
4189400,4190940," So, the player is rather important."
4190940,4194480," So, the player is rather important."
4194480,4195980," Can you show the in-game progress?"
4195980,4201920," I don't know if the game is actually working right now."
4203240,4204700," It is not working right now."
4204700,4207280," But we can open the deployed thing."
4207280,4209460," Right casting."
4209460,4214560," So, that's the current state of the engine."
4214560,4215040," Right?"
4215040,4218540," So, you can actually play with it yourself."
4218540,4220880," If you're interested."
4223480,4225940," W-A-S-D to control and stuff like that."
4225940,4229500," So, it's rendered using like a retro 3D techniques."
4229500,4233580," And it uses 2D canvas, not 3D canvas."
4233580,4237080," It doesn't use any OpenGL or any head by acceleration or anything like that."
4237080,4242000," So, that's basically the progress."
4242000,4244260," So far, we're just like rendering these sprites."
4244260,4246500," Hopefully, we'll succeed on that."
4246500,4247700," Okay."
4247700,4249280," Where's the math?"
4249280,4250300," Where's the math?"
4252260,4256020," So, sp minus pp."
4256020,4257440," Sp minus pp."
4257440,4259240," So, I suppose what we have to do."
4259240,4262820," We have to take the sprite position."
4262820,4265420," And I feel like we'll need to clone it."
4265420,4265720," Right?"
4265720,4269660," So, because the actual vector in here."
4269660,4271880," I feel like it's supposed to be reused."
4271880,4274900," Though, we can maybe have."
4274900,4278740," Like, we can pre-allocate one of the vector in here."
4278740,4279120," Right?"
4279120,4282140," So, how are we going to call this specific thing?"
4282580,4284380," How are we going to call this specific vector?"
4284380,4286120," So, it's more like sp."
4286120,4286640," Right?"
4286640,4287740," So, it's actually called sp."
4287740,4290500," So, I have to provide 0, 0."
4290500,4295720," So, in 3.js, actually a very cool idea is that just like basically initialize it with 0."
4295720,4299700," So, that way, if you just create this thing, it's like already initialized."
4300320,4302140," So, one of the things we can do with sp."
4302140,4303400," So, first thing we do."
4303400,4311080," We copy the sprite position."
4311080,4311580," Right?"
4311580,4314740," So, and copying basically just assigns."
4314740,4316280," Oh, I don't have a copying."
4316280,4317080," Okay."
4317080,4317700," So, yeah."
4317700,4318620," So, let's actually implement it."
4318620,4319300," I thought I had it."
4319640,4321280," So, it's supposed to take the other vector."
4321280,4322440," Right?"
4322440,4324060," And it obviously returns this."
4324060,4330140," And just sets that to this."
4330140,4331760," And returns this."
4331760,4332360," Right?"
4335360,4341320," So, we copy the sprite position."
4341320,4345740," And then we subtract the player position."
4345740,4347240," We subtract the player position."
4347240,4350000," And we get this specific vector."
4350000,4350340," Right?"
4350340,4351840," So, we get this specific vector."
4351840,4358760," So, and the reason why I don't want to clone this is because like if I just create this one vector once,"
4358760,4362420," it's not going to be created for each individual sprite."
4362420,4362720," Right?"
4362720,4364920," So, it's going to be reused for each individual sprite."
4364920,4368420," So, we're sort of like pre-allocating a bunch of objects and just use them."
4368420,4374080," And thus, we're reducing, you know, the pollution of the garbage collector and stuff."
4374080,4375560," All right."
4375560,4377000," So, we subtracted this entire thing."
4377000,4379160," So, we also need to have the direction."
4379160,4385140," And honestly, the direction vector is basically the same for all of them."
4385140,4386320," Right?"
4386320,4387460," So, we can call it deer."
4387460,4391500," And essentially, what we can do, we can do vector angle."
4391500,4394620," And this is just the player direction."
4394620,4395580," So, there we go."
4395580,4397600," So, we have sp and we have deer."
4397600,4399960," We have sp and we have deer."
4399960,4403260," And now, we just have to do dot product."
4403260,4403800," Right?"
4403800,4405260," So, we just do the dot product."
4405260,4409120," Funnily enough, dot product is just a number."
4409120,4412500," So, that means there's no vector creations anywhere."
4412500,4413520," So, which is good."
4414060,4416980," So, I just do sp dot deer."
4416980,4417580," Right?"
4417580,4418840," So, sp dot deer."
4418840,4423720," And after that, I have to divide it by the length of this entire vector."
4423720,4424060," Right?"
4424060,4426660," So, I divide it by sp length."
4427160,4431960," So, and that gives me the cosine of alpha between those things."
4431960,4432360," Right?"
4432360,4433440," So, it gives me that."
4433440,4442280," And that means I have to take this entire value and divide it by the near clipping plane."
4442280,4442940," Right?"
4443020,4445020," So, I divide it by the near clipping plane."
4445020,4448520," So, yeah."
4448520,4450080," I guess that's basically it."
4450080,4452240," And that gives me the length."
4452240,4452860," Right?"
4452940,4455860," So, that gives me the length from the position of the player."
4455860,4459400," From the position of the player to this point on the screen."
4459400,4460860," Right?"
4460860,4462460," So, that's pretty cool."
4462460,4465100," So, how can I call this entire thing?"
4465100,4466720," I can probably call it like a distance."
4466720,4470280," Maybe just d."
4470280,4476800," So, and what that means."
4476800,4478940," I can now take sp."
4478940,4479600," Right?"
4479600,4480500," I'm taking sp."
4481340,4483840," And I'm kind of like a normalizing it."
4483840,4484040," Right?"
4484040,4486140," So, as far as I know, normalizing also in place."
4486140,4486420," Right?"
4486420,4487700," I normalize the center, I think."
4487700,4489860," But then I scale it by the dist."
4489860,4490780," Right?"
4490780,4491860," I scale it by the dist."
4491860,4500440," And that thing basically becomes the point on this sort of like plane."
4500440,4502120," The point on this plane."
4502120,4508460," Now, I need to make an inverse lerp between p1 and p2."
4508460,4510460," So, and to do p1 and p2, I need to..."
4511340,4512360," Have them."
4512360,4512720," Right?"
4512720,4515400," So, to get a p1 and p2, I have to do fov range."
4515400,4515740," Right?"
4515740,4517340," So, this is a player fov range."
4517340,4520140," And I can do it only once."
4520140,4520400," Right?"
4520400,4528000," So, this p1 and p2 wings of fov are going to be reused on each individual sprite."
4528000,4529580," Hopefully."
4531780,4536520," So, and so, that sp is basically already projected."
4536520,4538120," It's already projected."
4538120,4540280," And we can..."
4540280,4542720," Yeah, we just need to do inverse lerp."
4542720,4544800," How do you do inverse lerp, by the way?"
4546800,4554800," So, a regular lerp, it allows you to take p1, p2, and t, which is a normalized value from 0 to 1."
4554800,4558360," And it will get you the value between p1 and p2."
4558360,4571200," An inverse lerp, an inverse lerp, actually, like ilerp, it takes p1, p2, and sp, and returns you t, which is a value from 0 to 1."
4571780,4572180," Right?"
4572180,4585320," I suppose the way you do that is just like you take p1 minus p2 minus p1, and you divide it by p2 minus sp."
4585320,4585940," Right?"
4585940,4586740," That's what you do."
4586740,4592560," So, and that way you get the t."
4592560,4598260," So, but that's more like a distance between them."
4598260,4598520," Right?"
4598620,4610640," So, that means we have to do p2, distance, distance to p1, divided by p2, distance to sp."
4610640,4614160," And all of that creates any of the new values."
4614160,4614480," Right?"
4614480,4615820," It doesn't create any of the new values."
4615820,4618020," So, that means you can just, like, you can just do that."
4618020,4618560," Right?"
4618560,4624560," Distance to is just a security of square distance, and square distance doesn't create any of the new vectors."
4624560,4625560," Right?"
4625620,4626840," So, that's totally fine."
4626840,4628540," And that's basically the t."
4628540,4629900," Right?"
4629900,4636480," And it's a value from 0 to 1, which indicates how close you are to all of these things."
4636480,4636760," Right?"
4636760,4638500," So, how close you are to all of that."
4638500,4642180," So, do we have any division in here?"
4642320,4644540," So, sp length, can it be equal to 0?"
4644540,4645960," It probably can be equal to 0."
4645960,4648400," Can any of that stuff be..."
4648400,4648560," Okay."
4648560,4655640," So, if the dot product here is equal to 0, you kind of end up with this thing being equal to 0, and that's the division by 0."
4655640,4659460," So, and I wonder if this is something that we want to be aware of."
4661360,4664200," Maybe, maybe we want to be aware of that."
4664200,4667300," So, we can maybe move that to dot."
4667300,4668640," All right."
4668640,4669720," So, this is going to be dot."
4669720,4676920," And if dot not equal to 0, only then we do all of that."
4676920,4679220," Otherwise, we skip this entire sort of iteration."
4679220,4679600," Right?"
4679640,4680620," I think it makes sense."
4680620,4681080," Right."
4681080,4683060," I think it makes sense."
4683060,4688620," So, afterwards, yeah, we have this T."
4688620,4691640," And that T is rather easy."
4691640,4692220," Right?"
4692220,4695860," So, it's essentially the X coordinate."
4695860,4698180," It's essentially the X coordinate."
4698180,4699960," So, you can try to do the following thing."
4699960,4709520," You take the distance, display, I mean, image data, image data into actually back image data into which you are rendering everything."
4709640,4710660," And you take a width."
4710660,4712000," And you just multiply it by T."
4712000,4718680," And you get the X coordinate of the column where the sprite is located."
4718680,4720020," That's it."
4720020,4721300," That's actually it."
4721300,4722040," Right."
4722040,4723760," Theoretically."
4723760,4727600," Theoretically, that's basically it."
4727600,4730540," So, and we can even try to render something there."
4730540,4732920," I think that's going to be rather interesting."
4732920,4735440," Right."
4735560,4741200," So, but we want to kind of skip the situations when T is outside of the range from 0 to 1 or whatever."
4741200,4741680," All right."
4741680,4743700," So, less or equal."
4743700,4747220," And T is less than or equal to 1."
4747220,4747520," Right."
4747520,4748980," So, we can try to do that."
4748980,4757560," So, and for now, what I'm thinking is that we probably want to..."
4757560,4761940," I don't want to really render the sprite yet."
4761940,4769000," I want to just render a spot where the sprite is supposed to be located."
4769000,4770460," That's what I want to do."
4770460,4774540," How are we going to be doing all that?"
4774540,4775800," How are we going to be doing all that?"
4775940,4789000," So, I think I'm going to be drawing on the CTX, which is the actual visible canvas, which allows me to just use the context, like canvas context primitives."
4789000,4789460," Right."
4789460,4790600," So, it allows me to do that."
4790600,4795180," But at the same time, what do I want to do?"
4795180,4797620," I probably want to do the scaling situation."
4798720,4800640," Do I want to do the scaling situation?"
4800640,4802160," That's also a good question."
4802160,4811940," So, I can do display CTX, save the current state of the context, then restore the context."
4811940,4815840," So, the audio is lower."
4815840,4817980," Maybe I'm just, like, far away from the mic."
4817980,4818800," So, is that better?"
4818800,4819640," Is that better?"
4819640,4820200," Okay."
4820200,4825620," So, if the audio is too low, just let me know I'll be closer to the mic."
4825620,4826920," Okay."
4826920,4827380," Cool."
4828100,4829780," So, maybe I should bring it a little bit."
4829780,4834460," But I'm a little bit worried that it's going to fall from the desk."
4834460,4836680," That happened once, actually."
4836680,4837400," And it's not pleasant."
4837400,4841820," So, let me maybe feel erect."
4841820,4844820," So, essentially, what's going to be the X?"
4844820,4845260," All right."
4845260,4851900," So, the X is going to be display CTX canvas width multiplied by T."
4851900,4853420," So, that's basically the X."
4853420,4857120," Y is probably going to be a half of the height."
4857480,4857780," All right."
4857780,4858900," So, I think that's fine."
4858900,4859980," I think that's fine."
4859980,4862460," So, this is where we want to render something."
4862460,4862920," Right."
4862920,4865560," So, let's go ahead and do that."
4865560,4866980," So, display CTX."
4866980,4870600," So, maybe we want to even do something like fill style."
4870600,4872280," And let's fill the style with red."
4872340,4873480," So, it's instantly visible."
4873480,4876440," And let's do that for the entirety of the thing."
4876440,4883820," And then, I'm going to do display CTX fill rectangle."
4883820,4887480," So, in terms of coordinates in here, what do we have?"
4887480,4889980," So, X and Y, W and H."
4890140,4890480," All right."
4890480,4896380," So, I would say it's X minus the size."
4896380,4898680," So, what's going to be the size?"
4898680,4903900," So, const mark size."
4903900,4905700," Let's say 100."
4907120,4910940," So, it's a minus mark size half of the mark."
4910940,4914740," Y minus mark size half of this thing."
4914740,4916260," And width and height is a mark size."
4916260,4918940," So, this is going to be like a rectangle."
4918940,4920300," All right."
4920300,4921760," So, all of that seems to be compiling."
4922980,4927740," And that's basically how we figure out the projection of the sprite on the screen."
4927740,4928460," Right."
4928460,4929960," This is my take on that."
4929960,4933880," I'm not 100% sure if that's the correct way to do that."
4933880,4940840," So, SP, if it's too close, it's a..."
4940840,4941000," Yeah."
4941000,4946540," So, we have to also be super careful if SP is equal to zero."
4946540,4949900," Or maybe we have to..."
4949900,4951860," So, if it's negative, by the way."
4952520,4954940," If the distance is negative, that means it's behind us."
4954940,4958520," So, that means we for sure don't want to do anything about that."
4958520,4961660," So, maybe it makes sense to actually pre-compute that."
4961660,4963320," So, let's say SPL."
4963320,4966240," This is going to be SP length."
4966240,4966680," Right."
4966680,4968000," So, this is SPL."
4968000,4971820," And we're going to say that SPL is greater than zero."
4971820,4972700," Right."
4972700,4976640," So, if it's less or equal than zero, let's actually do continue."
4976640,4978000," Continue."
4978000,4980100," Right."
4981500,4983380," So, then we do the dot product."
4983380,4986280," And a dot product also means something."
4986280,4986800," Right."
4986800,4990920," So, but I suppose we can just do something like this."
4990920,4998800," So, I suppose for a dot product being like something incorrect, SPL has to be less or equal than zero."
4998800,5000080," So, I think it's fine."
5000080,5001960," I think it's totally fine."
5002460,5011060," So, what I'm doing here, I'm just guarding from like a bad values for from potential bad values that may ruin something."
5011060,5012420," And I think it makes sense."
5012420,5012680," Right."
5012680,5014340," So, let's just continue."
5014340,5014820," Right."
5014820,5016000," Then it's going to be that."
5016000,5017560," Then we do that."
5018520,5022340," So, this thing is very unlikely."
5022340,5025820," Well, it could be zero, actually."
5025820,5028040," Distance."
5028040,5033920," So, distance to that."
5038360,5043120," Honestly, I think it's more like distance to P1."
5043120,5045920," But, I mean, there could be something wrong in here as well."
5045920,5049380," Distance of two."
5049380,5052800," Wait a second."
5052800,5053800," Just a second."
5057200,5065820," So, SPP1 to, yeah, I think it would be better to actually do P1 to P2 and then P1 to SP."
5065820,5066100," Yeah."
5066100,5068500," P1 to SP."
5068500,5070240," That makes a little bit more sense."
5070240,5075380," If it's too much equal, if they're equal to each other, this is probably going to be."
5075380,5080660," Yeah."
5080660,5081140," Okay."
5081140,5081780," I figured it out."
5081780,5085500," So, if it's equal to zero and it can be equal to zero, this entire thing is zero."
5085500,5085860," Okay."
5085860,5086100," Okay."
5086100,5086340," Okay."
5086960,5088020," We figured everything out."
5088020,5088980," We figured everything out."
5088980,5089640," Everything's fine."
5089640,5091080," All right."
5091080,5093560," I guess that's the thing we want to do."
5093560,5095260," Yeah."
5095260,5096460," So, they were inversed."
5096460,5096680," Yeah."
5096680,5098020," They were just inversed."
5098020,5101100," I think that's the thing we want to do."
5101100,5103780," So, we just figured out the position of the thing."
5103780,5105000," It's only the position."
5105000,5107160," So, we're not rendering the sprites yet."
5107160,5109260," But we're going to get there."
5109260,5111440," All right."
5111440,5113480," So, nothing is rendered completely."
5113480,5115320," Even though everything seems to be compiling."
5116140,5117520," So, there's some sort of error."
5117520,5119100," So, let's take a look at the console wall."
5119100,5120960," All right."
5120960,5123740," So, resources not found."
5123740,5123980," Okay."
5123980,5125460," So, water was not found."
5125460,5127240," Understandable."
5127240,5129180," Let's take a look."
5129180,5134080," Where's the water image?"
5135240,5137020," So, this is not open game art."
5137020,5140240," Oh, it's probably additional prefix in there."
5140240,5141560," So, water effect."
5141560,5142240," All right."
5142240,5144060," So, let's add water effect in here."
5144060,5145680," All right."
5145680,5147820," So, I can't see shit."
5147820,5149200," Yay."
5149200,5153340," I can't see shit."
5153880,5156800," Even if I scroll around."
5156800,5158420," That is very progress."
5158420,5158740," Okay."
5158740,5160760," So, let's take a look if we have any errors."
5160760,5166060," Okay."
5166060,5167180," So, everything's fine."
5167180,5167500," Right."
5167500,5169760," So, it's just like not displayed at all."
5169760,5171840," It's simply not displayed."
5171840,5172700," Interesting."
5175260,5178120," I know why."
5178120,5180700," I literally know why."
5180700,5181940," Because."
5181940,5186800," So, we're just collecting all of the pixels from floor, ceiling, and walls."
5186800,5190260," And then, we need to put them onto the main screen."
5190260,5196180," But then, I render the sprite into the main screen before I swapped this entire thing."
5196180,5196420," Okay."
5196420,5198360," So, I just do that in not correct order."
5198360,5201000," So, that's basically what happened in here."
5201000,5202620," Right."
5202620,5203900," So, hot reloaded the module."
5203900,5204320," Right."
5204400,5205700," So, that seems to be fine."
5205700,5207060," Still."
5207060,5208420," No."
5208420,5211040," Don't see anything."
5211040,5212720," All right."
5212720,5214120," That's very bizarre."
5214120,5215240," I would even say."
5215240,5217140," That is very bizarre."
5217140,5219140," Even though."
5219140,5221920," All right."
5221920,5223320," So, let's do the following thing."
5223320,5225160," Console.log.x and y."
5225160,5226320," And just throw."
5226320,5227160," Stop."
5227160,5229720," Where should it be rendered?"
5229720,5231140," Between the pillars."
5231140,5234360," So, let's give it a try."
5234400,5237040," So, I'm going to open the devtools."
5237040,5238540," Can I see shit?"
5238540,5239480," Let's hot reload."
5239480,5240980," Oof."
5240980,5243040," That is interesting."
5243040,5248160," So, we never get into that point."
5248160,5250920," So, it's supposed to crash."
5250920,5252800," But apparently, we never get here."
5253800,5256340," It's never between zero and one."
5256340,5256900," Like, at all."
5256900,5259620," That is fascinating."
5259620,5262900," Is that because we don't have any sprites?"
5265180,5266080," So, because."
5266080,5268280," Yeah."
5268280,5268660," Okay."
5268660,5271980," So, let me see."
5271980,5275960," So, maybe I can print sp."
5275960,5279820," And just throw."
5279820,5282640," Where is that?"
5282640,5282880," Okay."
5282880,5284260," So, that broke."
5284260,5285960," I'm really happy to see that."
5285960,5288060," What does it say?"
5288160,5288300," Okay."
5288300,5289580," So, this is a vector two."
5289580,5292160," And minus two."
5292160,5294100," Aha."
5294100,5297000," This is very interesting."
5297000,5297260," Okay."
5297260,5298100," So, that's fair."
5298100,5299760," That is actually fair."
5299760,5302660," So, let's print spl."
5302660,5306120," Let's print spl."
5306120,5306680," Okay."
5306680,5308240," So, spl seems fine."
5308240,5310740," Let's print dot."
5310740,5314960," Dot is one."
5314960,5317620," So, that seems fine."
5317620,5319380," So, the distance."
5319380,5321820," The distance that we print in here."
5321820,5324320," Is zero one."
5324320,5324900," Right."
5324900,5325980," It is zero one."
5325980,5329600," So, then we take the sp."
5329600,5331920," Which is basically the direction."
5331920,5333060," We normalize it."
5333060,5335700," And just scale it by the distance."
5335880,5337040," So, it has to be sp."
5337040,5340400," So, this is the value."
5340400,5342220," So, it's sort of like negative."
5342220,5343060," Right."
5343060,5344360," It's sort of like negative."
5344360,5346180," And then, if we take a look at t."
5346180,5347540," Right."
5347540,5348540," If we take a look at t."
5348540,5353340," That t is like completely blown off the charts."
5353340,5355620," It's completely blown off the charts."
5355620,5357160," And I don't really."
5357160,5357460," Maybe."
5357460,5362500," It should be visible at least somewhere."
5362500,5364080," That's the thing."
5365080,5366840," It should be visible at least somewhere."
5366840,5369880," So, if we take a look at the sprite position."
5369880,5374880," If we take a look at the sprite position."
5374880,5376320," The sprite position is half."
5376320,5376700," Okay."
5376700,5379900," And the player's position is."
5379900,5381940," Yeah."
5381940,5382560," Four."
5382560,5384500," So, it should be visible."
5384500,5385800," To some extent."
5385800,5389820," Direction."
5389920,5390560," Player direction."
5390560,5392060," We just use that."
5392060,5394000," So, everything's fine."
5394000,5401520," I really don't see any problems."
5401520,5403560," So, maybe I just need to make a small break."
5403560,5404680," Right."
5404680,5407040," To think about what I've done."
5407040,5408280," And maybe refill my water."
5408280,5409220," And stuff like that."
5409220,5410920," And yeah."
5411160,5412200," So, let's make a small break."
5412200,5413080," And after the break."
5413080,5413740," We're going to figure out."
5413740,5414720," What exactly is going on here."
5414720,5417100," Alright."
5417100,5419340," So, let's actually try to visualize."
5419340,5420320," This entire stuff."
5420320,5421180," On the minimap."
5421180,5421460," Right."
5421460,5422120," So, on the minimap."
5422120,5423180," We can at least see."
5423180,5424220," The reality."
5424220,5425300," On the top."
5425300,5425680," Right."
5426200,5427240," So, first of all."
5427240,5429040," Let me."
5429040,5431640," Open the game."
5431640,5433240," Right now."
5433240,5435340," Minimap doesn't display anything."
5435340,5436020," At all."
5436020,5438300," So, we have throw in here."
5438300,5439900," So, let's don't throw anything."
5439900,5441140," And render sprites."
5441140,5442620," Let's don't render sprites."
5442620,5444320," Something like this."
5444320,5445240," So, let's refer to this."
5445240,5445600," I think."
5445600,5445780," Yeah."
5445780,5447540," So, minimap does not display shit."
5447540,5449580," So, we need to at least fix that."
5449580,5451480," So, let me quickly do that."
5451480,5453360," So, for now."
5453360,5454220," I suppose."
5455120,5456840," I'm going to just quickly fix image data."
5456840,5457660," So, style."
5457660,5458540," Let's say."
5458540,5460940," That we're going to render all of these things with bool."
5460940,5462380," Right."
5462380,5463760," So, yeah."
5463760,5464100," There we go."
5464100,5465660," So, now we can see the walls."
5465660,5466480," At least."
5466480,5467340," On the minimap."
5467340,5469120," So, the problem with the minimap."
5469120,5470460," Is that it's kind of small."
5470460,5472140," Right."
5472140,5474300," So, let me make it a little bit bigger."
5474300,5476640," So, display cell."
5476640,5478440," What if I make it like five?"
5478440,5481180," Yeah."
5481180,5483260," That's a bit better."
5483260,5484260," So, maybe seven."
5484520,5485060," Okay."
5485060,5487100," Okay."
5487100,5487320," Cool."
5487320,5488540," So, now."
5488540,5490780," In the minimap."
5490780,5492980," I think I want to have."
5492980,5494820," Sprites."
5494820,5495540," Right."
5495540,5497660," So, we're going to have an array of sprites."
5497660,5500360," Just a single sprite."
5500360,5502860," And when I render the minimap."
5502860,5504400," Sprites."
5504400,5505940," Do we have any problems in here?"
5505940,5507160," Everything seems to be fine."
5507860,5508340," All right."
5508340,5516120," And afterwards, I want to just render the sprites somewhere."
5516120,5520600," So, let me see."
5520600,5523980," So, we just render some of that stuff."
5523980,5525320," This is strokes and everything."
5525320,5529700," For let sprite of sprites."
5531080,5532820," We have the position of the sprite."
5532820,5536000," So, we have to do context."
5536000,5537020," Fill rect."
5537020,5541120," And it's basically sprite position."
5541120,5543580," Position x minus."
5543580,5545300," So, we have a player size."
5545300,5546880," A notion of a player size."
5547860,5549580," And player size is rather small."
5549580,5552280," So, maybe we're going to just use sprite size."
5552280,5555120," So, where player size is defined."
5555120,5555580," Okay."
5555580,5558000," So, sprite size."
5558000,5559520," Which is going to be maybe three."
5560860,5563620," And I'm going to just copy paste this entire thing to here."
5563620,5565860," This is."
5565860,5567660," Yeah."
5567660,5569680," I can query replace player with sprite."
5569680,5570120," Boom."
5570120,5571660," Easy peasy."
5571660,5571940," Yeah."
5571940,5573260," There we go."
5573260,5578460," So, and honestly, I want to do CTX fill style."
5578460,5580020," And it's going to be red."
5580020,5584420," The color of the sprite is going to be red."
5584420,5585000," As you can see."
5585000,5586640," So, everything is red."
5586860,5592540," So, the problem here is that I can't see the FOB."
5592540,5595520," Because the nearest clipping plane is too far away."
5595520,5599320," It's like, you know, tenth of one."
5599320,5600200," Right."
5600200,5602980," So, let's maybe make it two or something."
5602980,5603480," Right."
5603480,5605020," So, now it is more visible."
5605020,5606880," But it creates a very funny effect."
5606880,5609840," So, you see like nearest clipping plane."
5609840,5612260," It just like really clips that thing."
5612260,5613940," If I."
5615000,5618400," Maybe I can get rid of the main minimap."
5618400,5619940," When I render the minimap."
5619940,5624440," But maybe, I mean, I can just like not render it at all."
5624440,5626700," Or maybe make it super small."
5626700,5627260," Right."
5627260,5630120," So, let's make it super small."
5630120,5631140," Yeah."
5631140,5636360," So, you can clearly see how the clipping plane actually clips the walls."
5636360,5640220," That's why the near clipping plane distance is so small."
5640220,5641180," Right."
5641180,5642780," So, it doesn't do this kind of shit."
5642780,5644200," So, it's actually kind of funny."
5644260,5644820," I really like that."
5644820,5648100," But I need to do that to be able to see that FLV."
5648100,5648780," All right."
5648780,5653060," So, and as you can see, this is where the sprite should be."
5653060,5654540," This is where it should be."
5654540,5656960," But we can't see anything in here at all."
5656960,5658700," Like, at all."
5658700,5659620," So, that's the problem."
5659620,5663240," It's kind of cool that it's like on the angle."
5663240,5663980," Yeah."
5663980,5667440," It also cuts everything."
5667520,5668380," I really like that."
5668380,5670320," It's super fun."
5670320,5670620," Anyway."
5670620,5675560," So, let's make it something like 7 again."
5675560,5677400," So, we can see the entirety of the minimap."
5678040,5681440," This specific minimap is a very useful, like, a debug tool and stuff."
5681440,5683280," It's a very useful debug tool."
5684520,5692080," So, here we have, like, a line width, which I think we should make a little bit smaller."
5692080,5693440," All right."
5693440,5694820," So, it's a little bit finer."
5694820,5698400," We can finally see what the fuck is going on in here."
5698500,5700200," So, I'm super happy with that, at least."
5700200,5701160," All right."
5701160,5705040," So, let's actually start porting some of the stuff in here."
5705040,5705980," So, sprite."
5705980,5708420," Render sprites."
5708420,5708680," Right."
5708680,5709540," So, that's what it was."
5709540,5710820," Render sprites."
5710820,5716660," And in here, we have a spee."
5716660,5717100," Right."
5717100,5719920," So, we have a spee and we have a direction of the player."
5719920,5724220," So, yeah."
5728220,5732720," So, we already have p1 and p2 and so on and so forth."
5732720,5733040," Okay."
5733040,5739920," This is the place where we do all of this thing."
5739920,5752840," And honestly, I suppose, once I figured out this thing, once I figured out this thing, I can just, yeah."
5756940,5762560," So, I'm just thinking how I'm going to be, you know, doing all of that stuff."
5763560,5771120," So, I have the distance and I have the dot product, which divides by that thing."
5771120,5772840," All right."
5772840,5774180," And that dot product..."
5774180,5782320," By the way, did I figure it out correctly, the definition of the dot product?"
5783020,5790640," Maybe this is where I made a mistake."
5790640,5792400," So, let's quickly do that."
5792640,5807040," I want to see the definition with the cos sign."
5807040,5807900," Where is the definition?"
5807900,5808160," Okay."
5808160,5809380," All right."
5809380,5810580," So, I was correct."
5810580,5810960," Right."
5810960,5812180," So, I was actually correct."
5812340,5814500," So, it's just both of these things."
5814500,5815340," All right."
5815340,5817680," So, the direction is one."
5817680,5820120," Because of that, we don't have to divide this entire thing."
5820960,5825580," So, the problem is..."
5825580,5834280," So, this factor is not particularly useful."
5834280,5834760," I can't..."
5834760,5837680," Like, I'm trying to think what I can visualize in here."
5837680,5839280," I can see what I can visualize in here."
5839280,5840460," I just found the direction."
5841580,5849040," So, one of the things I can do to visualize this entire thing is maybe take the player position and just, like, add..."
5849040,5850780," Like, obviously, I need to clone it, right?"
5850780,5851940," So, because it's going to modify it."
5851940,5853600," Add SP."
5853600,5856880," And that gives me the point that I could visualize, right?"
5856880,5858640," So, I can maybe stroke a line."
5858640,5863200," Stroke a line from one place to another one."
5863200,5864520," All right."
5864520,5866320," So, I can provide the CTX."
5866320,5867860," I can provide the player position."
5867860,5870460," And then I can provide this entire thing, right?"
5870480,5871540," It's kind of, like, redundant."
5871540,5874700," But it's just, like, I'm doing that to check the math, right?"
5874700,5876880," So, I'm just doing that to check the math."
5876880,5878200," Okay."
5878200,5880680," So, that makes sense as we move around."
5880680,5883840," That creates everything I want to see."
5883840,5890740," So, and another thing I can render in here is just a position plus the direction in here."
5890740,5895360," So, and also CTX stroke style."
5895360,5897920," Let's actually say it's yellow, right?"
5897920,5899380," So, let's actually do that in yellow."
5900100,5900920," And it did that."
5900920,5901240," Okay."
5901240,5902440," So, it kind of worked, right?"
5902440,5902880," So, okay."
5902880,5904440," So, we can see all of these things."
5904440,5905460," This is actually kind of cool."
5905460,5907480," I really like that."
5907480,5908700," Yo, what the fuck?"
5908700,5912340," So, that's so cool."
5912340,5914800," All right."
5914800,5915040," All right."
5915040,5921360," So, to be fair, we can maybe stroke this entire thing once, right?"
5921360,5925340," So, because it's going to be a single direction for each sprite."
5926700,5927100," Right."
5927100,5927380," Okay."
5927380,5928160," I like that."
5928160,5929640," Render sprites."
5929640,5933560," Finally, I found something that I can kind of visualize."
5933560,5943300," So, after that, I want to check that SPL length is correct, right?"
5943300,5944840," If it's less or equal than zero."
5945520,5947720," That means something is weird in there."
5947720,5953960," Though, like it doesn't, it's probably never going to be actually less than equal than zero, right?"
5953960,5955260," So, it doesn't make any sense."
5955260,5959020," But, I mean, it could be equal to zero, if you know what I mean."
5959120,5961280," So, let's put it this way."
5961280,5962480," Not equal to zero."
5962480,5966320," And this one is also not equal to zero."
5966320,5967980," All right."
5967980,5972700," So, after that, we got the dot product of these things."
5972700,5975340," And we also divide it by SPL."
5982340,5984240," So, we also divide it by SPL."
5984240,5985720," And then we get the distance."
5985720,5986340," All right."
5986340,5991400," So, afterwards, we're just normalizing this entire thing."
5991400,5993140," We're just normalizing this entire thing."
5993140,5998620," And this is what I would like to maybe try to render one more time."
5998620,5999460," All right."
6001360,6006900," So, ah, and I think I found a mistake."
6006900,6010420," And I think I found a mistake because it has to be relative to the position."
6010420,6010680," Okay."
6010680,6015380," So, player position, then add SP because it's only a direction."
6015380,6017460," Yeah."
6017460,6020660," It's only a direction."
6020660,6022780," Did I forget to save?"
6022780,6024020," I think I forgot to save."
6024020,6028540," Damn."
6028540,6029540," I didn't see shit."
6031360,6031820," All right."
6031820,6033160," So, that didn't."
6033160,6033920," Ah."
6033920,6035200," Yeah."
6035200,6036160," That explains it."
6036160,6043000," So, what we have to do in here is just take this point and maybe mark it somehow."
6043000,6043760," All right."
6043760,6045340," So, we have to mark it somehow."
6045340,6047680," So, this is a projected."
6047680,6049480," So, const projected."
6049480,6057220," And here we are going to do this kind of thing."
6057220,6060880," So, replace projected."
6061360,6064680," Got it."
6064680,6065980," Look at that."
6065980,6070780," So, it works correctly."
6070780,6074000," And I think this is the bug."
6074000,6081180," This is the bug that I was talking about because the actual point, right, the actual point is,"
6081180,6085000," has to be player position plus."
6085640,6092920," So, the thing you have to do, you have to scale it and then add player position, player position to that."
6093920,6095200," And that's your SP."
6095200,6095600," And that's your SP."
6095600,6098480," All right."
6098480,6100460," I said player."
6100460,6101380," Hmm."
6101380,6102600," What the fuck is going on?"
6102600,6103900," Emacs, don't be so slow."
6103900,6105820," All right."
6105820,6106160," All right."
6106160,6106440," All right."
6106440,6108400," Is everything okay?"
6108400,6109940," I think it hot reloaded everything."
6110080,6110260," Yeah."
6110260,6113740," That is basically what we should have done."
6113740,6116860," That is basically what we should have done to make this entire thing visible."
6116860,6118920," Yo."
6118920,6119960," That is so cool."
6119960,6124640," By the way, we can continue sort of porting this entire thing."
6124640,6126760," Render sprites."
6127140,6147820," So, if we add this check, right, so we can say if kind of not continue, so we can add this thing."
6147820,6151360," All right."
6152380,6152660," Yeah."
6152660,6155780," As you can see, if we..."
6155780,6157820," All right."
6157820,6159140," This one is bizarre."
6159140,6168340," So, it became like a negative, but it still was trying to render some shit."
6168340,6177120," So, I would expect this thing to become negative, but I mean, maybe we can do something like absolute."
6179720,6183800," Math absolute value is less than that."
6183800,6189040," No, it's still going there."
6189040,6190840," Well, I guess it's fine."
6190840,6192280," So, I found the error."
6192280,6193400," That's what's important."
6193400,6194260," That's what's important."
6194260,6195640," We found the error."
6195640,6205060," So, which means that let's reduce the size of the minimap where we set the size."
6205060,6207420," Where we set the size, do you see the size?"
6207420,6211500," So, it's a minimap size in here."
6211500,6214240," So, it's basically three."
6214240,6215500," Let's actually reduce it to three."
6215500,6217880," So, we don't care about that stuff anymore."
6218220,6222340," And now, I can render the sprites."
6222340,6231060," And in here, what I have to do is, after we normalize the center, I think I have to add the player position like so."
6231060,6234160," And only then, this thing makes sense."
6234160,6236300," Only then, this thing makes sense."
6236300,6238440," All right."
6238440,6238920," We'll go."
6240920,6241580," There we go."
6241580,6242180," We have a sprite."
6242180,6249800," So, and we can see it from the other side."
6249800,6255340," So, it would be nice to maybe do near clipping plane back to its original value."
6255340,6256680," All right."
6256680,6257560," So, it doesn't clip."
6257560,6257780," Yeah."
6257780,6259080," So, here's the sprite."
6259080,6262920," Like, you can see through that and stuff like that."
6262920,6264200," So, it's a usual thing."
6264200,6266120," So, it's totally fine."
6268060,6270360," It is a totally fine minor point."
6270360,6275360," So, it is kind of bizarre in some sense."
6275360,6277640," But the algorithm is there."
6277640,6279460," It's pretty cool."
6279460,6280220," It's pretty cool."
6280220,6280620," It's pretty cool."
6280620,6288020," So, now, based on the distances and stuff like that, you can figure out, you know, the size of the sprite itself."
6288020,6288480," Right."
6288480,6290180," So, yeah."
6290180,6290940," So, it's pretty cool."
6290940,6293560," Size seems inverted."
6293560,6294820," Size is not taken."
6294820,6296720," It is not computed at all."
6296720,6297300," Right."
6297360,6298600," It's literally hard-coded."
6298600,6300860," Like, we haven't got to that point yet."
6300860,6306680," So, but we'll get there at some point."
6306680,6308660," That's pretty cool."
6308660,6315800," So, there's something that kind of bothers me with random minimap when you, yeah, when you look at the minimap."
6315800,6320360," So, minimap size, it's, let's actually go back in here."
6320360,6322280," Right."
6322280,6323580," Back to the minimap."
6323580,6325840," Where am I, by the way?"
6326660,6327900," This is shit."
6327900,6328560," Let me refresh."
6328560,6328940," Okay."
6328940,6332260," So, yeah."
6332260,6338780," So, let's get rid of the render sprites."
6338780,6342800," We don't render the sprites."
6342800,6344860," Near clipping plane."
6344860,6347720," Let's put it back to 2."
6351040,6351460," Yeah."
6351460,6356420," So, when we have this kind of situation, it should not be rendered."
6356420,6361000," And when we have this kind of situation, it should be not rendered either."
6361000,6365140," So, we need to somehow protect ourselves from this kind of situations."
6365140,6369900," And so, as you can see here, it is rendered as well."
6372100,6376420," So, this is the really strange situation."
6376420,6379860," How can we protect ourselves from DOS?"
6379860,6385960," It only seems inverted because everything else..."
6385960,6387700," Yeah, so, the size stays the same."
6387700,6389660," So, the size doesn't change at all."
6389660,6395720," Do you change your HMR to your own implementation?"
6395720,6396880," What do you mean change?"
6396880,6399020," I implemented it myself from scratch."
6399020,6401760," Version what you said, but I stopped in the middle of it."
6402300,6404580," I didn't change to my own implementation."
6404580,6407300," I implemented it myself day one."
6407300,6408120," Full stop."
6408120,6413440," Because why the fuck would you do anything else while working in a toy scripting language?"
6413440,6414780," That is dynamic."
6414780,6417520," That's the definition of dynamic language."
6417520,6418960," Anyways."
6418960,6422060," What do we have?"
6422060,6423460," Let me register."
6423460,6425200," So, this is a render minimap."
6425200,6428600," Render minimap."
6430080,6432160," Language literally has a val."
6432160,6437940," And people think they need a fucking..."
6437940,6440500," Like, an entire framework to hot reload anything."
6440500,6443820," Like, that's beyond me."
6443820,6446380," That is literally beyond me."
6446380,6448100," Like, your language literally has a val."
6448100,6449420," What the fuck are you talking about?"
6449420,6451040," Are you okay?"
6451040,6453360," Anyways."
6453360,6459360," What is going on here?"
6459360,6460720," So, we have this kind of thing."
6460720,6463620," So, SPL length."
6463620,6467160," Length is always going to be actually positive."
6467160,6468780," Like, it doesn't matter."
6468780,6472780," Length is always going to be positive."
6472780,6479360," So, we need to kind of look at the dot product, right?"
6479440,6489120," So, the dot product kind of gives you the information where you are, like, information about how big your angle is, right?"
6489120,6491400," So, because it's a cosine of the angle, right?"
6491400,6492580," It's a cosine of the angle."
6492580,6498000," And to be fair, I don't really have an intuition about the cosine of the angle, right?"
6498700,6501000," And I don't really have that good of an intuition."
6501000,6504000," So, yeah."
6504000,6507700," I can try to do some things like this, right?"
6507700,6520140," So, if t is 0 equal to t and t is less or equal than 1, we, if not, right, if not, you just, you know, continue."
6520140,6525880," So, that should kind of protect you from some of the situations, right?"
6526080,6530000," So, it doesn't protect you from left side."
6530000,6531520," That's what worries me."
6531520,6534180," It protects you from right side, like this."
6534180,6536460," But it doesn't protect you from this one."
6536460,6540320," And it, like, makes me question, like, what the fuck is going on there?"
6540320,6542300," Like, what the fuck is really going on there?"
6542300,6546000," So, maybe we could print a text."
6546000,6548420," Draw, how do you draw text?"
6548420,6553220," So, we can maybe set."
6554600,6557240," Let me try to do that."
6557240,6564920," So, this is going to be more like the pixels, white, and the text that we can put in here is going to be t."
6564920,6569980," We can put it at spx, spy."
6569980,6571860," Right, spx, spy."
6571860,6573180," I can't see shit, brother."
6573180,6577160," Why don't you render anything?"
6577160,6579940," Did it crash?"
6579940,6584040," Don't tell me it's crashed."
6584600,6586020," Display is not defined."
6586020,6586780," Ah, I see."
6586780,6587660," It's fine."
6587660,6592280," Display is not defined."
6592280,6595380," All right."
6595380,6597060," So, what do I have?"
6597060,6603240," Oh, Jesus fucking crap."
6603240,6606140," This is the..."
6606140,6606520," Okay."
6606520,6606560," Okay."
6606560,6609360," Okay."
6609360,6611000," So, one pixel."
6611000,6613620," Can I just have one pixel?"
6613620,6613960," Okay."
6613960,6617040," Oof."
6617040,6619400," It's actually growing in here."
6619400,6620240," Somehow."
6620240,6621160," How does..."
6621160,6622280," How the fuck does it grow?"
6622280,6624300," Ah, because it's a fucking distance."
6624300,6625660," Can't fucking do it."
6625660,6625880," Okay."
6625880,6629500," Because it's a fucking distance."
6629580,6631820," So, we don't really want to be doing the distance."
6631820,6636460," We don't really want to be doing the distance."
6636460,6638260," We want to be doing something else, actually."
6638260,6641580," But the question is..."
6641580,6644500," What exactly we want to be doing?"
6644500,6646660," Maybe only on the level of, like, x."
6651280,6653400," But, nah, distance is what we want to be doing."
6653400,6655700," Distance is what we want to be doing."
6655700,6662520," So, yeah."
6662520,6665080," I don't really know how to protect that."
6665080,6666420," Maybe I'm going to do that a little bit later."
6666420,6669220," Maybe I'm going to do that a little bit later."
6669220,6671660," So, okay."
6671660,6673540," I guess we figured everything out."
6673540,6674900," I think we..."
6674900,6676260," I guess we figured everything out."
6676260,6678020," And maybe I'm going to"
6678020,6681260," simply disable this entire thing."
6681280,6682020," for now."
6682020,6684160," Because, like, being able to render these things"
6684160,6684900," is kind of useful."
6684900,6686960," So, I don't really want to get rid of that."
6686960,6689600," So, rendering"
6689600,6692660," the sprite"
6692660,6694120," projection."
6694120,6695860," Rendering the sprite projection."
6695860,6698860," And maybe .product."
6698860,6699980," Yeah, I was thinking about that."
6699980,6701080," But I already said that"
6701080,6703300," I don't have an intuition about .product."
6703300,6703860," Right?"
6703860,6705780," So, I already explicitly said that."
6705780,6707900," That it would be the correct thing"
6707900,6709260," to do .product"
6709260,6711140," and do something based on the .product"
6711140,6712360," but I don't have an intuition"
6712360,6713220," about .product"
6713220,6714420," so I'm not going to do that."
6714420,6716100," Right."
6716100,6716900," So,"
6716900,6721080," I know that .product"
6721080,6722520," has some sort of a meaning"
6722520,6723800," about the angle"
6723800,6725160," and people do use it."
6725160,6727180," .product equal to 0"
6727180,6729320," means something."
6729320,6729980," Right?"
6729980,6732080," I think it means 90 degrees"
6732080,6733500," or something like that."
6734260,6735440," So, if you take a look"
6735440,6736420," since it's a cosine"
6736420,6738580," since it's a cosine"
6738580,6741200," the cosine is equal to 0"
6741200,6742880," when it's 90 degrees."
6742880,6743580," Right?"
6743580,6745260," Well, okay."
6745260,6747840," So, we can do that."
6747840,6750060," So, I suppose"
6750060,6753600," then it goes to negative part."
6753600,6754120," Right?"
6754120,6755640," Then it goes to negative part."
6758420,6759940," So, it goes to negative part"
6759940,6761460," and then it goes backwards."
6761460,6762000," Right?"
6762000,6763200," So, then it goes backwards."
6763200,6764700," We can try to"
6764700,6765960," yeah, one of the things"
6765960,6766360," we can do"
6766360,6766820," we can just"
6766820,6770480," we can simply"
6770480,6773760," forbid negative values."
6773760,6775760," That's one thing"
6775760,6776400," we can do."
6779640,6782640," So, because"
6782640,6784020," it's basically cosine."
6784020,6785420," It's basically cosine."
6785420,6786220," Right?"
6786220,6787140," Here it's positive."
6787140,6789460," Then it goes towards 0."
6789460,6789800," Right?"
6789800,6790640," It goes towards 0"
6790640,6791540," at 90 degrees."
6791540,6793100," Then at"
6793100,6794180," towards"
6794180,6796140," 180 degrees"
6796140,6798560," towards 180 degrees"
6798560,6799440," it stays"
6799440,6800040," in a negative."
6800040,6801260," Okay."
6801260,6802440," Then"
6802440,6803740," it"
6803740,6805020," essentially"
6805020,6806520," stays"
6806520,6807260," in a negative"
6807260,6808600," while going"
6808600,6808880," to"
6808880,6809400," 270."
6809400,6809820," Right?"
6809820,6810220," So, I think"
6810220,6811440," it's 270."
6811440,6812580," Yes, 270."
6812580,6814440," And then it starts"
6814440,6815500," going here."
6815500,6816080," So, it's not"
6816080,6816680," particularly like"
6816680,6817680," a useful thing"
6817680,6818220," for us."
6818220,6820280," It's not"
6820280,6820740," particularly"
6820740,6821860," useful thing"
6821860,6822940," for us."
6822940,6825580," But what"
6825580,6826280," if it goes"
6826280,6826740," like"
6826740,6829340," we can"
6829340,6830280," do something"
6830280,6831140," about FOV"
6831140,6831700," honestly."
6831700,6833620," Right."
6833620,6834480," We can do"
6834480,6835180," something about"
6835180,6835740," FOV."
6835740,6837320," So, essentially"
6837320,6839380," where is"
6839380,6839740," the dot"
6839740,6840260," product."
6840260,6847600," So,"
6847600,6851620," what is"
6851620,6852620," value of"
6852620,6853000," cosine"
6853000,6853740," at"
6853740,6854780," 45?"
6854780,6856620," We can"
6856620,6857180," basically"
6857180,6857860," pre-compute"
6857860,6858540," the cosine"
6858540,6860100," at 45 degrees"
6860100,6860680," at half"
6860680,6861000," of the"
6861000,6861500," FOV"
6861500,6863460," and we"
6863460,6863860," can just"
6863860,6864700," use that"
6864700,6865280," as a"
6865280,6865660," value"
6865660,6867320," to sort"
6867320,6868040," of make"
6868040,6868600," sure that"
6868600,6869040," this thing"
6869040,6869840," stays within"
6869840,6870340," the right"
6870340,6870720," stuff."
6870720,6874020," Right."
6874020,6875020," So, that's"
6875020,6875620," one of the"
6875620,6876160," things we"
6876160,6876880," can try"
6876880,6877380," to do."
6877380,6877920," But also,"
6877920,6878600," we have to"
6878600,6879420," multiply by"
6879420,6879800," the"
6879800,6882440," length,"
6882440,6882900," width,"
6882900,6883560," and whatnot."
6883560,6884340," Well, we"
6884340,6884880," actually have"
6884880,6885440," an actual"
6885440,6885820," FOV,"
6885820,6886280," so that's"
6886280,6886860," totally fine."
6887440,6888600," so render"
6888600,6889320," minimap."
6889320,6889920," Render"
6889920,6890760," minimap."
6890760,6892060," Where is"
6892060,6892660," that thing?"
6892660,6893840," So, let's"
6893840,6894660," enable that."
6894660,6895440," Okay."
6895440,6896240," So, thank"
6896240,6896700," you whoever"
6896700,6897580," asked about"
6897580,6898500," dot product."
6898500,6899140," You forced"
6899140,6899460," me to"
6899460,6899820," actually"
6899820,6900940," develop an"
6900940,6901340," intuition."
6901340,6904460," It's actually"
6904460,6904840," really funny."
6904840,6905360," Like, I didn't"
6905360,6905840," have intuition."
6905840,6906540," Now, I have"
6906540,6906980," a little bit"
6906980,6907460," of intuition,"
6907460,6907860," which is"
6907860,6908080," good."
6908080,6909320," Right."
6909320,6909560," So,"
6909560,6909960," essentially,"
6909960,6910380," here,"
6910380,6911280," what I want"
6911280,6911580," to do."
6914660,6915420," So, I"
6915420,6916000," want this"
6916000,6916600," thing to"
6916600,6917220," be"
6917220,6920480," from"
6920480,6922860," basically"
6922860,6925140," math"
6925140,6926140," cosine"
6926140,6927400," of"
6927400,6928100," FOV,"
6928100,6928720," half of"
6928720,6929400," the FOV."
6929400,6929740," Right."
6929740,6930220," Half of"
6930220,6930800," the FOV."
6930800,6933120," So, it"
6933120,6933560," has to be"
6933560,6934140," less or"
6934140,6934600," equal,"
6934600,6935940," because I"
6935940,6936520," know for a"
6936520,6936900," fact that"
6936900,6937680," this is"
6937680,6938300," literally a"
6938300,6938580," cosine."
6938580,6939360," Right."
6939360,6939740," Because we"
6939740,6940420," even divided"
6940420,6940800," it by"
6940800,6941200," SPL,"
6941200,6941560," so it's"
6941560,6941940," literally"
6941940,6942360," cosine."
6942360,6943200," So,"
6943200,6943960," and dot"
6943960,6945060," is"
6945060,6945540," less or"
6945540,6945780," equal"
6945780,6946200," than"
6946200,6947140," one."
6947140,6948060," So, that's"
6948060,6948340," what we're"
6948340,6948660," trying to"
6948660,6948920," do in"
6948920,6949100," here."
6949100,6952340," So, I"
6952340,6952960," mean, this"
6952960,6953240," kind of"
6953240,6953700," operation is"
6953700,6954280," probably slow,"
6954280,6954660," but I"
6954660,6955480," mean, it's"
6955480,6956480," fine for"
6956480,6957180," now, and"
6957180,6957560," it doesn't"
6957560,6958100," fucking work."
6958100,6958320," It's"
6958320,6958620," something,"
6958620,6958980," something"
6958980,6959520," broke."
6959520,6960840," Something"
6960840,6961300," fucking"
6961300,6961740," broke,"
6961740,6962120," bruv."
6962120,6963380," Something"
6963380,6964000," fucking"
6964000,6964620," broke,"
6964620,6965120," bruv."
6965120,6966600," So,"
6966600,6967380," oh,"
6967500,6973960," fucking"
6973960,6974400," sea"
6974400,6974760," brain"
6974760,6975140," damage,"
6975140,6975360," I"
6975360,6975680," swear"
6975680,6975880," to"
6975880,6976160," God,"
6976160,6976480," it's"
6976480,6977240," fucking"
6977240,6977820," sea"
6977820,6978340," brain"
6978340,6978840," damage."
6978840,6979460," Anyway,"
6979460,6991840," and it's"
6991840,6992560," shit, by"
6992560,6992980," the way."
6992980,6997200," It's"
6997200,6997680," fucking"
6997680,6998160," shit,"
6998160,6998500," meat."
6998500,6999880," Fucking"
6999880,7000460," shit."
7000460,7003640," So,"
7003640,7004340," that means"
7004340,7004940," my intuition"
7004940,7005540," is not"
7005540,7005980," particularly"
7005980,7006340," cracked."
7006440,7006720," what if"
7006720,7006920," I"
7006920,7007360," have"
7007360,7007480," a"
7007480,7007740," half"
7007740,7007860," of"
7007860,7007980," a"
7007980,7008260," pixel?"
7008260,7015320," Wait."
7015320,7019100," Not."
7019100,7022180," Now we're"
7022180,7022580," fucking"
7022580,7022940," talking,"
7022940,7023420," motherfucker."
7023420,7025320," Now we're"
7025320,7025760," fucking"
7025760,7026240," talking."
7026240,7026620," And it"
7026620,7028080," holy shit,"
7028080,7028600," I just"
7028600,7029680," developed an"
7029680,7030620," intuition for"
7030620,7031140," fucking"
7031140,7031820," dot product."
7031820,7032400," What the"
7032400,7032700," fuck?"
7032700,7035540," I"
7035540,7035900," thought I"
7035900,7036280," would never"
7036280,7036800," do that."
7036800,7037340," But I"
7037340,7037560," just"
7037560,7037800," like"
7037800,7038720," achievement"
7038720,7039240," like I"
7039240,7039800," understand."
7039800,7042080," Because it's"
7042080,7042720," basically cosine,"
7042720,7043160," right?"
7043160,7044260," That's it."
7044260,7044920," There's nothing"
7044920,7045460," much to say"
7045460,7045760," in here."
7045760,7048540," It's"
7048540,7048940," basically"
7048940,7049360," cosine,"
7049360,7049780," but"
7049780,7050140," yeah."
7050140,7060460," Fucking"
7060460,7061140," easy-peasy"
7061140,7061860," lemon fucking"
7061860,7062340," squeezy,"
7062340,7062820," motherfucker."
7062820,7064880," Fucking"
7064880,7065300," easy."
7066120,7066340," punk."
7066340,7068360," Anyways."
7068360,7071320," So let"
7071320,7071900," me see."
7071900,7073720," We can"
7073720,7074300," precompute"
7074300,7074900," this thing,"
7074900,7076480," by the way."
7076480,7077300," We can"
7077300,7078020," precompute"
7078020,7078500," this thing."
7078500,7079680," Who said"
7079680,7080100," we can't"
7080100,7080540," do that?"
7080540,7081340," Right,"
7081340,7081700," so we can"
7081700,7082320," always say"
7082320,7084440," half"
7084440,7085080," cos"
7085080,7086400," of"
7086400,7087180," half"
7087180,7088040," FOV."
7088040,7089600," Yeah."
7089600,7092340," Make sense?"
7092500,7092980," since it's"
7092980,7093420," a constant"
7093420,7093940," cos"
7093940,7094420," of"
7094420,7095180," half"
7095180,7096820," FOV,"
7096820,7097260," we can"
7097260,7097580," even do"
7097580,7097840," it like"
7097840,7098120," that."
7098120,7106180," So we don't"
7106180,7106780," recompute it"
7106780,7107100," cos"
7107100,7107700," of half"
7107700,7108120," FOV."
7108120,7110060," Yep."
7110060,7110800," So"
7110800,7113140," only"
7113140,7113860," computed"
7113860,7114720," once."
7115180,7115600," All right,"
7115600,7116160," so that's"
7116160,7116580," the only"
7116580,7116980," sort of"
7116980,7117620," check"
7117620,7118120," that we"
7118120,7118660," need here."
7118660,7119840," Render"
7119840,7120600," sprites."
7120600,7122900," So"
7122900,7123540," and it's"
7123540,7123840," going to be"
7123840,7124500," replaced by"
7124500,7125360," this check"
7125360,7127840," which is"
7127840,7128760," somewhere here"
7128760,7129360," and we"
7129360,7129660," don't need"
7129660,7130140," this check"
7130140,7130500," anymore."
7130500,7131200," Right,"
7131200,7131520," if it's"
7131520,7132040," equal to"
7132040,7132320," zero,"
7132320,7133080," that's it,"
7133080,7133780," we're not"
7133780,7134000," going to"
7134000,7134180," render"
7134180,7134600," anything."
7135460,7136060," All right,"
7136060,7136600," render"
7136600,7138880," sprites"
7138880,7140480," enable"
7140480,7141520," this shit."
7141520,7142700," Maybe"
7142700,7143560," don't render"
7143560,7144240," minimap."
7144240,7145980," Yeah."
7145980,7155740," Pretty cool."
7155740,7156800," It's pretty cool."
7156800,7158620," I really like"
7158620,7158780," that."
7163460,7164700," So"
7164700,7166180," that single"
7166180,7166460," math"
7166460,7167080," cosine"
7167080,7167620," is pretty"
7167620,7168180," actually"
7168180,7168720," heavy."
7168720,7170920," Thank you"
7170920,7171200," anonymous"
7171200,7171500," gifter."
7171500,7171960," Thank you,"
7171960,7172360," thank you"
7172360,7173060," for gifting"
7173060,7173360," subs"
7173360,7174140," and shit."
7174140,7175980," Subs"
7175980,7176580," and shit."
7176580,7177660," Something"
7177660,7181120," really weird"
7181120,7181480," happened."
7181480,7187540," I forgot"
7187540,7188120," how to"
7188120,7188940," pop"
7188940,7189860," the"
7189860,7191180," previous"
7191180,7191980," mark,"
7191980,7192560," but"
7192560,7193360," yeah,"
7193360,7193640," whatever."
7193640,7197260," So let's"
7197260,7197760," put zero"
7197760,7198200," in here."
7198200,7199800," Okay,"
7199800,7201060," so everything"
7201060,7201540," is pretty"
7201540,7201840," cool."
7201840,7205060," I can"
7205060,7205840," safely"
7205840,7207280," disable"
7207280,7207980," the minimap"
7207980,7208380," or just"
7208380,7208600," like,"
7208600,7208880," you know,"
7208880,7209420," reduce the"
7209420,7209760," size of"
7209760,7210180," this thing"
7210180,7212440," and I"
7212440,7212840," can"
7212840,7214500," bring"
7214500,7214940," back"
7214940,7215620," the near"
7215620,7216040," clipping"
7216040,7216460," plane"
7216460,7217140," like so."
7217140,7218180," All right,"
7218180,7219320," so everything"
7219320,7220440," still works."
7220440,7221000," Everything"
7221000,7221900," still works."
7222560,7223640," nice."
7223640,7224760," Nice,"
7224760,7225120," nice,"
7225120,7225500," nice."
7225500,7228940," So we"
7228940,7229260," need to"
7229260,7229460," implement"
7229460,7229800," the rest"
7229800,7230040," of this"
7230040,7230300," stuff."
7230300,7230700," So we"
7230700,7230940," need to"
7230940,7231260," now"
7231260,7232600," figure out"
7232600,7233420," the size"
7233420,7234080," of this"
7234080,7234440," sprite"
7234440,7236880," based on"
7236880,7237140," the"
7237140,7238940," perpendicular"
7238940,7239620," distance,"
7239620,7240160," perpendicular"
7240160,7240920," distance."
7240920,7242020," Render"
7242020,7242580," sprite."
7242580,7250260," So perpendicular"
7250260,7251500," distance,"
7251500,7252400," perpendicular"
7252400,7253300," distance."
7253300,7254300," So we"
7254300,7254720," know"
7254720,7255300," the"
7255300,7256220," location"
7256220,7257320," of the"
7257320,7262540," if we"
7262540,7262820," take a"
7262820,7263040," look at"
7263040,7263540," how we"
7263540,7264060," render"
7264060,7264460," the"
7264460,7266520," walls."
7266520,7267100," Render"
7267100,7267600," walls."
7267600,7269200," Render"
7269200,7269700," walls."
7269700,7271180," So we"
7271180,7271580," have this"
7271580,7272140," z-buffer."
7272140,7272520," So this"
7272520,7272740," is a"
7272740,7273020," perpendicular"
7273020,7273780," distance."
7273780,7275140," We take"
7275140,7278880," a vector"
7278880,7279420," which is"
7279420,7280400," like a"
7280400,7281780," vector from"
7281780,7282260," the player"
7282260,7283120," to the"
7283120,7284560," thing and"
7284560,7285220," we do a"
7285220,7285840," dot product"
7285840,7286320," with the"
7286320,7286940," direction."
7287900,7289700," essentially."
7289700,7294740," Let's get"
7294740,7295100," rid of"
7295100,7295500," that."
7295500,7296680," Though"
7296680,7297620," we might"
7297620,7298060," need x"
7298060,7298540," and y."
7298540,7299340," At least"
7299340,7299720," we might"
7299720,7300380," need x"
7300380,7300740," on the"
7300740,7301040," screen."
7301040,7301820," So x"
7301820,7302180," is kind"
7302180,7302600," of useful"
7302600,7303640," and y"
7303640,7303920," is going"
7303920,7304080," to be"
7304080,7304220," just"
7304220,7304440," slightly"
7304440,7304780," different."
7304780,7309960," So we"
7309960,7310520," take"
7310520,7311740," the"
7311740,7312360," sprite"
7312360,7313060," position."
7313060,7313760," So this"
7313760,7314040," is a"
7314040,7314340," sprite"
7314340,7314960," position."
7314960,7315960," We're"
7315960,7316120," probably"
7316120,7316420," going to"
7316420,7316920," clone it"
7316920,7317360," but then"
7317360,7317540," we're"
7317540,7317740," going to"
7317740,7318080," subtract"
7318080,7318420," the"
7318420,7318640," player"
7318640,7319160," position."
7319160,7322680," And then"
7322680,7323320," we want"
7323320,7324960," to take"
7324960,7325340," a dot"
7325340,7325840," product"
7325840,7328340," with the"
7328340,7328840," direction."
7328840,7329420," We do"
7329420,7329800," have a"
7329800,7330200," direction"
7330200,7330800," up there"
7330800,7331720," so that"
7331720,7332060," seems to"
7332060,7332360," be good."
7332360,7334540," And that's"
7334540,7336500," basically"
7336500,7337860," essentially"
7337860,7338920," like a"
7338920,7340920," vector."
7343920,7344420," yeah so"
7344420,7344840," that's"
7344840,7345160," the"
7345160,7345560," perpendicular"
7345560,7346240," distance."
7346240,7353260," So you"
7353260,7353580," have"
7353580,7354840," this"
7354840,7355200," sort of"
7355200,7355680," distance"
7355680,7357540," but this"
7357540,7357780," is a"
7357780,7358080," perpendicular"
7358080,7358780," distance."
7358780,7360840," That's"
7360840,7361320," pretty cool."
7361320,7362040," And that's"
7362040,7362400," the one"
7362400,7362800," we have"
7362800,7363300," to use"
7363300,7363780," to figure"
7363780,7364180," out"
7364180,7364540," the"
7364540,7366020," size."
7366360,7367140," and size"
7367140,7368620," is"
7368620,7369120," essentially"
7369120,7369820," going to"
7369820,7370080," be"
7370080,7372640," sprite"
7372640,7373320," size"
7373320,7374600," the"
7374600,7375220," distance"
7375220,7376040," divided"
7376040,7376560," by"
7376560,7377680," I think"
7377680,7379280," so there"
7379280,7379460," was"
7379460,7379980," something"
7379980,7380580," where is"
7380580,7380760," the"
7380760,7381200," render"
7381200,7381620," wall"
7381620,7382400," render"
7382400,7383020," walls"
7383020,7385120," stripe"
7385120,7385700," yeah"
7385700,7386240," so we"
7386240,7386760," take"
7386760,7388260," the"
7388260,7388640," back"
7388640,7389020," image"
7389020,7389460," height"
7389460,7389700," the"
7389700,7390140," full"
7390140,7390520," height"
7390520,7390780," and"
7390780,7391140," divide"
7391140,7391320," it"
7391320,7391580," by"
7391580,7392400," that"
7392400,7395020," right"
7395020,7396360," so but"
7396360,7397100," do we"
7397100,7397380," have"
7397380,7397940," yeah so"
7397940,7398160," we have"
7398160,7398780," a display"
7398780,7399700," so this"
7399700,7400020," is a"
7400020,7400380," sprite"
7400380,7401600," okay"
7401600,7402120," that's"
7402120,7402620," very cool"
7402620,7404480," that is"
7404480,7405040," very cool"
7405040,7405440," that is"
7405440,7405840," very cool"
7405840,7406360," but if"
7406360,7406600," we're going"
7406600,7406880," to be"
7406880,7407860," drawing"
7407860,7408540," that"
7408540,7409480," on the"
7409480,7413700," on the"
7413700,7414000," screen"
7414000,7415060," IceLeo"
7415060,7415400," thank you"
7415400,7415740," so much"
7415740,7416360," for five"
7416360,7417240," gifted subs"
7417240,7417580," thank you"
7417580,7417820," thank you"
7417820,7418380," thank you"
7418380,7418700," all right"
7418700,7419020," so this"
7419020,7419480," is basically"
7419480,7419940," the sprite"
7419940,7420340," size"
7420340,7421320," right"
7421320,7421700," if we're"
7421700,7421860," going to"
7421860,7422200," consider"
7422200,7422640," the sprite"
7422640,7422960," size"
7422960,7423600," is equal"
7423600,7424100," to one"
7424100,7424460," right"
7424460,7425040," so that's"
7425040,7425320," what we're"
7425320,7425440," going to"
7425440,7425760," be using"
7425760,7426620," but we can"
7426620,7427040," always"
7427040,7427640," maybe"
7427640,7428400," like take"
7428400,7428800," half of"
7428800,7428940," that"
7428940,7429360," but yeah"
7429360,7429600," whatever"
7429600,7431020," so"
7431020,7432200," let's"
7432200,7432780," actually do"
7432780,7433500," ctx"
7433500,7434460," canvas"
7434460,7434960," height"
7434960,7435560," right"
7435560,7435860," so this"
7435860,7436120," is going"
7436120,7436260," to be"
7436260,7436640," ctx"
7436640,7436960," canvas"
7436960,7437240," height"
7437240,7438900," and"
7438900,7439560," essentially"
7439560,7440380," what I"
7440380,7440680," want to"
7440680,7440860," do"
7440860,7441880," I want"
7441880,7442420," to render"
7442420,7443400," this entire"
7443400,7443620," thing"
7443620,7444060," like so"
7444060,7444440," so this"
7444440,7444640," is going"
7444640,7446040," to be"
7446040,7447240," sprite"
7447240,7449980," sprite"
7449980,7450820," size"
7450820,7452700," and also"
7452700,7453120," this is"
7453120,7453460," sprite"
7453460,7453880," size"
7453880,7455180," I feel"
7455180,7455380," like"
7455380,7455960," that's"
7455960,7456420," it"
7456420,7458440," basically"
7458440,7459220," in terms"
7459220,7459540," of"
7459540,7460220," y"
7460220,7460760," in terms"
7460760,7460940," of"
7460940,7461220," y"
7461220,7461620," in terms"
7461620,7461820," of"
7461820,7462140," y"
7462140,7465300," const"
7465300,7466140," y"
7466140,7466960," display"
7466960,7467740," ctx"
7467740,7468380," canvas"
7468380,7468940," height"
7468940,7469980," half"
7469980,7470960," that's"
7470960,7471180," going to"
7471180,7471500," be that"
7471500,7471820," and it's"
7471820,7471980," just"
7471980,7472160," gonna"
7472160,7473340," yeah"
7473340,7473840," that's"
7473840,7474180," the thing"
7474180,7474660," we need"
7474660,7474880," to do"
7474880,7475220," in here"
7475220,7475920," that's"
7475920,7476240," the thing"
7476240,7476540," we need"
7476540,7476860," to do"
7476860,7477500," go"
7477500,7486140," so"
7486140,7486960," it's"
7486960,7487300," it's"
7487300,7487740," we're painting"
7487740,7491200," okay"
7491200,7491640," so"
7491640,7492580," okay"
7492580,7494640," pretty cool"
7494640,7498720," so"
7498720,7499580," I understand"
7499580,7499980," the map"
7499980,7500640," the fact"
7500640,7501060," that I"
7501060,7501440," can just"
7501440,7501620," like"
7501620,7502420," modify things"
7502420,7502740," and it"
7502740,7503040," works"
7503040,7503560," means"
7503560,7503800," I"
7503800,7504320," understand"
7504320,7504700," math"
7504700,7505740," and that"
7505740,7505920," is"
7505920,7506460," so"
7506460,7506860," fucking"
7506860,7507360," important"
7507360,7508300," that is"
7508300,7508960," insanely"
7508960,7509500," important"
7509500,7510500," one of the"
7510500,7510800," things we"
7510800,7511240," can do"
7511240,7511760," in here"
7511760,7512180," right"
7512180,7512480," so we"
7512480,7512640," can"
7512640,7513040," take"
7513040,7513380," half"
7513380,7513560," of"
7513560,7513800," that"
7513800,7516040," yeah"
7516040,7516420," now"
7516420,7516940," it is"
7516940,7517220," like"
7517220,7517840," that"
7517840,7519520," yeah"
7519520,7519820," that's"
7519820,7520120," cool"
7520120,7522600," very"
7522600,7523480," cool"
7523480,7526680," all right"
7526680,7527680," so"
7527680,7528160," and"
7528160,7528680," the last"
7528680,7528880," thing"
7528880,7529200," that we"
7529200,7529440," need to"
7529440,7529580," do"
7529580,7529940," in here"
7529940,7530520," is"
7530520,7530740," the"
7530740,7530920," z"
7530920,7531080," buffer"
7531080,7533980," so"
7533980,7534360," we're"
7534360,7534560," not"
7534560,7535060," rendering"
7535060,7536000," directly"
7536000,7536800," into"
7536800,7539560," into"
7539560,7539820," the"
7539820,7540520," back"
7540520,7541060," image"
7541060,7541460," right"
7541460,7541760," so"
7541760,7541980," into"
7541980,7542140," the"
7542140,7542340," back"
7542340,7542620," image"
7542620,7542840," we"
7542840,7543340," drawing"
7543340,7543580," it"
7543580,7543880," like"
7543880,7544480," sort of"
7544480,7544620," like"
7544620,7545040," overlay"
7545040,7545880," similar to"
7545880,7546360," minimap"
7546360,7547740," we have"
7547740,7548800," sort of"
7548800,7549580," two canvases"
7549580,7550700," the canvas"
7550700,7551540," for array"
7551540,7552020," casting"
7552020,7552820," which operates"
7552820,7553220," on a level"
7553220,7553580," of single"
7553580,7553880," pixels"
7553880,7554760," and"
7554760,7555800," the canvas"
7555800,7556520," with overlay"
7556520,7557100," where we can"
7557100,7557460," use the"
7557460,7557900," actual"
7557900,7558360," things"
7558360,7559780," you know"
7559780,7560220," the actual"
7560220,7560580," canvas"
7560580,7561000," and stuff"
7561000,7561820," so"
7561820,7562780," this is"
7562780,7563460," an overlay"
7563460,7563920," stuff"
7563920,7564420," it's not"
7564420,7564960," within the"
7564960,7565280," pixels"
7565280,7565940," or anything"
7565940,7566320," that"
7566320,7567080," right"
7567080,7567600," so one"
7567600,7568040," thing we"
7568040,7568480," need to"
7568480,7569100," do now"
7569100,7570000," one thing"
7570000,7570280," we need"
7570280,7570620," to do"
7570620,7571080," is"
7571080,7572820," make it"
7572820,7573180," render"
7573180,7574000," within the"
7574000,7574780," pixelated"
7574780,7575200," canvas"
7575200,7575720," with a"
7575720,7576200," lower"
7576200,7576760," resolution"
7576760,7577220," and stuff"
7577220,7577560," like that"
7577560,7578060," so that's"
7578060,7578520," one thing"
7578520,7578860," we have"
7578860,7579360," to do"
7579360,7580800," how are we"
7580800,7581060," going to be"
7581060,7581460," doing all"
7581460,7581780," of that"
7581780,7582240," all right"
7582240,7582640," so we"
7582640,7583040," have to"
7583040,7584300," get rid"
7584300,7585240," of the"
7585240,7586780," display"
7586780,7587460," right"
7587460,7588260," of CTX"
7588260,7588540," and we"
7588540,7588820," have to"
7588820,7589440," start working"
7589440,7589780," on"
7589780,7590760," back"
7590760,7593480," image"
7593480,7593920," data"
7593920,7594860," right"
7594860,7595280," so"
7595280,7596460," we're rendering"
7596460,7597000," into the"
7597000,7597660," back image"
7597660,7598020," data"
7598020,7599360," so the"
7599360,7600260," other CTX"
7600260,7601300," this is"
7601300,7602260," back"
7602260,7602840," image"
7602840,7603500," data"
7603500,7603960," and this"
7603960,7604540," is also"
7604540,7605120," well I mean"
7605120,7605860," this one"
7605860,7606140," is going to"
7606140,7606440," be rather"
7606440,7606960," interesting"
7606960,7607460," right"
7607460,7607820," this one"
7607820,7608000," is going"
7608000,7608120," to be"
7608120,7608280," rather"
7608280,7608620," interesting"
7608620,7608940," so we"
7608940,7609420," now have"
7609420,7609660," to"
7609660,7611960," sort of"
7611960,7612360," like"
7612360,7615380," do"
7615380,7615860," another"
7615860,7616260," loop"
7616260,7616640," that"
7616640,7617100," iterates"
7617100,7617640," from left"
7617640,7618180," to right"
7618180,7619180," so yes"
7619180,7619720," we need"
7619720,7619920," to do"
7619920,7620440," the stripes"
7620440,7620820," we need"
7620820,7621020," to do"
7621020,7621420," the stripes"
7621420,7624420," and"
7624420,7625220," yeah"
7625220,7625800," what's"
7625800,7626200," funny"
7626200,7627040," is that"
7627040,7627420," like"
7627420,7628020," X"
7628020,7631520," so"
7631520,7632100," you can"
7632100,7632560," do"
7632560,7633480," Y"
7633500,7634140," which"
7634140,7634320," is"
7634320,7635500," you know"
7635500,7635940," half"
7635940,7636120," of"
7636120,7636320," this"
7636320,7636560," thing"
7636560,7637040," so"
7637040,7637320," what"
7637320,7637460," if"
7637460,7637600," I"
7637600,7637940," put"
7637940,7638860," 75"
7638860,7639160," in"
7639160,7639400," here"
7639400,7639960," just"
7639960,7640560," let me"
7640560,7641140," bring back"
7641140,7641580," CTX"
7641580,7641940," because I"
7641940,7642260," think I"
7642260,7644340," can figure"
7644340,7644960," out something"
7644960,7645200," cool"
7645200,7645540," so this"
7645540,7645820," is the"
7645820,7646120," full"
7646120,7646760," ah"
7646760,7646980," fuck"
7646980,7647240," okay"
7647240,7647440," so"
7647440,7647800," everything's"
7647800,7647980," fine"
7647980,7648820," so this"
7648820,7649080," is the"
7649080,7649260," full"
7649260,7650100," I can"
7650100,7650860," reduce"
7650860,7651580," its size"
7651580,7653100," with this"
7653100,7653500," factor"
7653500,7654720," and I"
7654720,7655300," feel like"
7655300,7655840," I can"
7655840,7656860," now lower"
7656860,7657520," it down"
7657520,7658260," with this"
7658260,7658700," factor"
7658700,7659900," kind"
7659900,7660100," of"
7660100,7660460," eh"
7660460,7660900," nah"
7660900,7661480," doesn't"
7661480,7661640," really"
7661640,7661840," work"
7661840,7662060," that"
7662060,7662360," one"
7662360,7665820," or"
7665820,7666300," maybe"
7666300,7666720," I"
7666720,7667180," actually"
7667180,7667500," just"
7667500,7667760," did"
7667760,7668080," too"
7668080,7668460," much"
7668460,7668680," what"
7668680,7668820," if"
7668820,7668940," I"
7668940,7669120," put"
7669120,7669740," 25"
7669740,7669980," in"
7669980,7670280," here"
7670280,7672520," yeah"
7672520,7673240," I think"
7673240,7673420," it's"
7673420,7673580," too"
7673580,7673900," much"
7673900,7674380," right"
7674380,7674600," so"
7674600,7674740," it"
7674740,7674960," doesn't"
7674960,7675140," really"
7675140,7675460," fit"
7675460,7676000," perfectly"
7676000,7677720," right"
7677720,7677920," so"
7677920,7678080," it's"
7678080,7678280," more"
7678280,7678520," like"
7678520,7678700," a"
7678700,7679120," half"
7679120,7680300," yeah"
7680300,7681640," I'm"
7681640,7681780," not"
7681780,7682000," really"
7682000,7682180," sure"
7682180,7682500," how"
7682500,7683260," exactly"
7683260,7683520," to"
7683520,7683920," offset"
7683920,7684360," that"
7684360,7685460," I'm"
7685460,7685600," not"
7685600,7685820," really"
7685820,7686100," sure"
7686100,7686360," how"
7686360,7686840," exactly"
7686840,7689680," but"
7689680,7690160," to be"
7690160,7690560," fair"

8175360,8175680," okay"
8175680,8176200," so"
8176200,8176720," that means"
8176720,8177180," we need to"

8190520,8191080," four"
8191080,8191960," yeah"
8191960,8192200," so"
8192200,8192400," we"

8196660,8197080," direction"
8197080,8197940," I'm"
8197940,8198240," gonna do"
8198240,8199800," right"
8199800,8200200," so"
8200200,8200440," and"
8200440,8201000," in here"
8201000,8203160," this is"
8203160,8203340," going to"

8204320,8206740," nah"
8206740,8207160," it doesn't"
8207160,8207480," doesn't"

8208200,8212160," render"
8212160,8212740," sprites"
8212740,8212940," so"
8212940,8213360," we do"
8213360,8213820," render"
8213820,8214600," sprites"
8214600,8221920," so"
8221920,8222160," maybe"
8222160,8222540," I did"
8222540,8223040," clamp"
8223040,8223700," clamping"
8223700,8224080," correctly"

8225400,8226200," right"
8226200,8226540," so"
8226540,8226860," the"
8226860,8227140," first"
8227140,8227460," thing"
8227460,8229620," ah"
8229620,8230820," I'm"
8230820,8230900," an"
8230900,8231100," idiot"
8231100,8231420," so"
8231420,8231880," yeah"
8231880,8232580," that's"
8232580,8232920," that's"
8232920,8233120," true"
8233120,8233420," that's"
8233420,8233720," true"
8233720,8237260," do"
8237260,8237780," I have"
8237780,8237940," to"
8237940,8238360," refresh"
8238360,8238820," that"
8238820,8245160," am"
8245160,8245360," I"
8245360,8245920," going"
8245920,8246560," fucking"
8246560,8247060," crazy"
8247060,8247700," so"
8247700,8248040," minimum"
8248040,8248640," maximum"
8248640,8249220," value"

8253440,8253740," oh"
8253740,8254040," yeah"
8254040,8255320," right"
8255320,8257720," you're"
8257720,8258000," right"
8258000,8259660," oh"
8259660,8260300," fuck"
8260300,8261280," well I"
8261280,8261500," mean"
8261500,8262200," that's"
8262200,8262580," something"
8262580,8265220," all right"
8265220,8265720," so that's"
8265720,8266180," that's already"
8266180,8267000," something at least"
8267000,8267700," right so we can"
8267700,8268400," work with that"
8268400,8270160," so display"

8270540,8271000," image"
8271000,8271600," data"
8271600,8275240," so what if"
8275240,8275880," I just"
8275880,8276720," always do"
8276720,8277140," that"
8277140,8277720," I mean"
8277720,8278400," that should"

8291900,8292300," I didn't"
8292300,8292740," think"

8326980,8334040," so it's"
8334040,8334280," speaking"
8334280,8334880," out of"
8334880,8335120," them"
8335120,8337020," yeah"
8337020,8337480," bruv"
8337480,8338340," bruv"
8338340,8340700," bruv"
8340700,8341020," bruv"
8341020,8341380," bruv"
8341380,8341700," bruv"
8341700,8342600," look at"
8342600,8342760," that"
8342760,8343160," motherfucker"
8343160,8343480," it's"
8343480,8343720," speaking"
8343720,8344080," out"
8344080,8344220," of"
8344220,8344320," the"
8344320,8346560," thing"
8346560,8351140," that's"
8351140,8351360," so"
8351360,8351820," fucking"
8351820,8352400," poggers"
8352400,8353680," that is"
8353680,8353980," so"
8353980,8354440," fucking"
8354440,8354900," poggers"
8354900,8355280," we"
8355280,8355860," implemented"
8355860,8356240," that"
8356240,8357180," we"
8357180,8357760," actually"
8357760,8358060," and"
8358060,8358480," ironically"
8358480,8359300," implemented"
8359300,8359780," that"
8359780,8362080," in"
8362080,8362300," three"
8362300,8362660," hours"
8362660,8364080," so"
8364080,8364440," now"
8364440,8366320," we"
8366320,8366640," have"
8366640,8366840," like"
8366840,8367240," everything"
8367240,8367600," to"
8367600,8367880," make"
8367880,8368000," a"
8368000,8368200," game"
8368200,8368420," right"
8368420,8368580," so"
8368580,8368780," like"
8368780,8368880," a"
8368880,8369100," very"
8369100,8369560," basic"
8369560,8369940," simple"
8369940,8370320," game"
8370320,8371580," right"
8371580,8371840," so"
8371840,8372100," because"
8372100,8372280," we"
8372280,8372420," can"
8372420,8372620," use"
8372620,8372800," the"
8372800,8373180," sprites"
8373180,8373660," to"
8373660,8374100," denote"
8374100,8375340," items"
8375340,8375640," that"
8375640,8375760," you"
8375760,8375940," can"
8375940,8376420," collect"
8376420,8377540," or"
8377540,8378600," like"
8378600,8379140," effects"
8379140,8379780," particles"
8379780,8380080," and"
8380080,8380320," stuff"
8380320,8380500," like"
8380500,8380660," that"
8380660,8380820," so"
8380820,8381020," if"
8381020,8381120," we're"
8381120,8381200," going"
8381200,8381240," to"
8381240,8381380," be"
8381380,8381760," shooting"
8381760,8382420," some"
8382420,8382740," enemies"
8382740,8383120," this"
8383120,8383240," is"
8383240,8383380," going"
8383380,8383440," to"
8383440,8383580," be"
8383580,8383820," the"
8383820,8384300," sprites"
8384300,8384560," also"
8384560,8384960," enemies"
8384960,8385520," themselves"
8385520,8385820," could"
8385820,8386060," be"
8386060,8386960," these"
8386960,8387160," kind"
8387160,8387260," of"
8387260,8387600," sprites"
8387600,8388140," so"
8388140,8388640," the"
8388640,8389160," engine"
8389160,8389500," is"
8389500,8390060," basically"
8390060,8390680," complete"
8390680,8391700," so to"
8391700,8392040," speak"
8392040,8392640," the"
8392640,8392900," engine"
8392900,8393100," is"
8393100,8393480," basically"
8393480,8393900," complete"
8393900,8395340," so"
8395340,8395820," yeah"
8395820,8396120," that's"
8396120,8396500," super cool"
8396500,8397440," so let's do"
8397440,8397680," committee"
8397680,8398180," committee and"
8398180,8398580," potentially"
8398580,8398960," pushy"
8398960,8399300," pushy"
8399300,8399740," and"
8399740,8400080," we"
8400080,8400120," and we"
8400120,8400340," will"
8400340,8400500," be"
8400500,8400680," able"
8400680,8400860," to"
8400860,8401200," finally"
8401200,8401500," start"
8401500,8401860," working"
8401860,8402260," on a"
8402260,8402580," freaking"
8402580,8404380," game"
8404380,8404820," right"
8404820,8405200," so"
8405200,8405720," because"
8405720,8405980," yeah"
8405980,8406340," we've been"
8406340,8406840," developing"
8406840,8407400," the game"
8407400,8407780," for quite"
8407780,8408120," some time"
8408120,8408440," I mean"
8408440,8408820," the engine"
8408820,8409180," for quite"
8409180,8409520," some time"
8409520,8409780," already"
8409780,8410720," the time"
8410720,8411100," has come"
8411100,8411660," to develop"
8411660,8412220," a freaking"
8412220,8412740," game"
8412740,8414600," so this"
8414600,8415000," stuff"
8415000,8415620," I'm not"
8415620,8415820," sure"
8415820,8416560," if it's"
8416560,8417600," that particularly"
8417600,8417920," useful"
8417920,8418380," so we'll"
8418380,8418600," actually"
8418600,8419080," keep"
8419080,8421000," so we have"
8421000,8421460," type"
8421460,8423240," and I see"
8423240,8423680," what's going"
8423680,8423980," on"
8423980,8424660," yeah"
8424660,8425160," so"
8425160,8426020," we haven't"
8426020,8426380," implemented"
8426380,8427180," actual"
8427180,8427740," like"
8427740,8428580," images"
8428580,8429080," and shit"
8429080,8429440," so maybe"
8429440,8429820," this is"
8429820,8430100," something"
8430100,8430440," that we"
8430440,8430780," have to"
8430780,8431000," do"
8431000,8431980," yeah"
8431980,8432800," so let's"
8432800,8433240," go ahead"
8433240,8433720," and"
8433720,8435640," yeah"
8435640,8437380," let's go ahead"
8437380,8438200," and actually"
8438200,8439800," try to"
8439800,8440120," render"
8440120,8440920," an image"
8440920,8442920," so do we"
8442920,8443600," load the"
8443600,8444100," images"
8444100,8446240," okay"
8446240,8447260," so just a"
8447260,8447640," second"
8447640,8449480," we need to"
8449480,8450160," restore"
8450160,8450740," everything"
8450740,8451120," that we"
8451120,8451460," have in"
8451460,8451700," here"
8451700,8454880," so and"
8454880,8455280," now if I"
8455280,8455680," take a look"
8455680,8456060," at that"
8456060,8456600," stuff"
8456600,8459180," bruh"
8459180,8461020," I lost"
8461020,8462120," did I lose"
8462120,8462620," the changes"
8462620,8463280," or something"
8463280,8465680," because if"
8465680,8465920," I"
8465920,8467740," well here"
8467740,8468320," they are"
8468320,8471280," yeah so"
8471280,8471760," everything's"
8471760,8472060," fine"
8472060,8474820," I don't"
8474820,8475040," know what"
8475040,8475240," the fuck"
8475240,8475500," is going"
8475500,8475660," on"
8475660,8475920," honestly"
8475920,8479820," so"
8479820,8480780," recompile"
8480780,8483880," oh"
8483880,8485020," here's the"
8485020,8485640," funny thing"
8485640,8486340," it's just"
8486340,8486620," in the"
8486620,8486960," game"
8486960,8487360," in the"
8487360,8487680," clamp"
8487680,8488060," I forgot"
8488060,8488740," to denote"
8488740,8489400," that those"
8489400,8489800," things are"
8489800,8490240," numbers"
8490240,8492480," these"
8492480,8492960," things are"
8492960,8493640," numbers"
8493640,8497280," the"
8497280,8497520," animals"
8497520,8498200," could be"
8498200,8499000," pull requests"
8499000,8499400," you need"
8499400,8499900," to protect"
8499900,8500300," your"
8500300,8501200," project"
8501200,8501640," repo"
8501640,8502180," I don't"
8502180,8502500," understand"
8502500,8502780," what you're"
8502780,8502980," talking"
8502980,8503340," about"
8503340,8504900," number"
8504900,8505820," number"
8505820,8506480," okay"
8506480,8511640," bruh"
8511640,8513220," where is"
8513220,8513480," the"
8513480,8514360," oh it's"
8514360,8514900," because it's"
8514900,8515360," okay"
8515360,8516420," so I'm"
8516420,8516960," already tired"
8516960,8517320," already"
8517320,8517640," tired"
8517640,8517980," like I'm"
8517980,8518380," looking at"
8518380,8518740," the stage"
8518740,8519080," changes"
8519080,8519420," and I'm"
8519420,8519880," being surprised"
8519880,8520740," where are the"
8520740,8521040," changes"
8521040,8521480," okay why"
8521480,8522240," they don't"
8522240,8522480," change"
8522480,8522800," they were"
8522800,8523180," staged"
8523180,8524540," all right"
8524540,8525080," everything's"
8525080,8525320," fine"
8525320,8525800," everything's"
8525800,8525960," fine"
8525960,8526280," so"
8526280,8527860," what I want"
8527860,8528120," you to do"
8528120,8528340," I want"
8528340,8528540," you to"
8528540,8528940," actually"
8528940,8531060," do the"
8531060,8532040," rendering"
8532040,8532540," right"
8532540,8532920," so we"
8532920,8533120," need to"
8533120,8533380," do the"
8533380,8533680," rendering"
8533680,8534600," of the"
8534600,8535040," image"
8535040,8535580," and shit"
8535580,8537200," so"
8537200,8537960," render"
8537960,8538600," sprites"
8538600,8540280," render"
8540280,8540860," sprites"
8540860,8542540," if you"
8542540,8542800," take a"
8542800,8543040," look at"
8543040,8543220," this"
8543220,8543520," thing"
8543520,8545640," we have"
8545640,8546160," like x"
8546160,8546620," and y"
8546620,8547180," and whatnot"
8547180,8548940," we need to"
8548940,8549500," map all of"
8549500,8549860," that shit"
8549860,8550260," to texture"
8550260,8550720," coordinates"
8550720,8551240," it should"
8551240,8551680," be really"
8551680,8551940," easy"
8551940,8554340," so we"
8554340,8555040," just do"
8555040,8556340," tx"
8556340,8556880," and"
8556880,8558020," basically"
8558020,8558520," what is"
8558520,8559260," that"
8559260,8559620," like"
8559620,8560220," we need"
8560220,8560460," to"
8560460,8561120," map x"
8561120,8561560," from 0"
8561560,8562040," to width"
8562040,8563920," right"
8563920,8564460," so"
8564460,8564800," and it's"
8564800,8564960," going to"
8564960,8565420," be x"
8565420,8565940," minus x"
8565940,8566200," 1"
8566200,8567400," and we"
8567400,8567960," effectively"
8567960,8568920," divide that"
8568920,8569400," by"
8569400,8570520," the"
8570520,8570900," sprite"
8570900,8571360," size"
8571360,8572860," and there"
8572860,8573140," you go"
8573140,8573700," that's it"
8573700,8574560," basically"
8574560,8575960," so we"
8575960,8576600," now have"
8576600,8576920," the"
8576920,8577520," texture"
8577520,8578120," coordinates"
8578120,8579080," now we"
8579080,8579540," have texture"
8579540,8580000," coordinates"
8580000,8581680," now we"
8581680,8582460," need to"
8582460,8583660," effectively"
8583660,8584740," so this"
8584740,8585420," is more"
8585420,8585800," like a"
8585800,8586340," destination"
8586340,8586880," index"
8586880,8587200," right"
8587200,8587800," so let's"
8587800,8588100," call it"
8588100,8589100," destination"
8589100,8589440," p"
8589440,8591440," and then"
8591440,8591960," we need"
8591960,8592320," to figure"
8592320,8592760," out"
8592760,8593280," the"
8593280,8594360," source"
8594360,8595260," thing"
8595260,8596000," so we"
8596000,8596700," divide it"
8596700,8597100," by sprite"
8597100,8597560," to map it"
8597560,8598020," from 0"
8598020,8598400," to 1"
8598400,8599060," to normalize"
8599060,8599220," it"
8599220,8599960," but then"
8599960,8600540," we now"
8600540,8600940," need to"
8600940,8601480," multiply it"
8601480,8602360," by sprite"
8602360,8603740," image data"
8603740,8604220," width"
8604220,8604820," to map it"
8604820,8605320," to the value"
8605320,8606320," from like 0"
8606320,8607300," to the rest"
8607300,8607700," of the stuff"
8607700,8608940," so we can"
8608940,8609480," even floor"
8609480,8610000," this entire"
8610000,8610400," thing"
8610400,8611280," right"
8611280,8611920," so this one"
8611920,8612320," is going to be"
8612320,8612560," math"
8612560,8613040," floor"
8613040,8614560," divided by"
8614560,8614920," that"
8614920,8615680," and multiply"
8615680,8616540," by sprite"
8616540,8618440," sprite"
8618440,8618960," image"
8618960,8619580," data"
8619580,8620340," height"
8620340,8621080," right"
8621080,8621460," so we have"
8621460,8621900," this kind"
8621900,8622220," of thing"
8622220,8623160," so that"
8623160,8623980," should give"
8623980,8624220," us"
8624220,8625400," srcp"
8625400,8625940," right"
8625940,8626680," so it's"
8626680,8627720," going to be"
8627720,8628420," ty"
8628420,8629480," multiplied by"
8629480,8629940," sprite"
8629940,8630460," image"
8630460,8631220," data"
8631220,8631760," width"
8631760,8632200," plus"
8632200,8632980," tx"
8632980,8634220," multiplied"
8634220,8635220," by 4"
8635220,8635600," and"
8635600,8636460," essentially"
8636460,8636960," instead of"
8636960,8637560," headcoding the"
8637560,8637720," color"
8637720,8638240," we're taking"
8638240,8638700," that color"
8638700,8639280," from"
8639280,8639760," the"
8639760,8640520," sprite"
8640520,8640920," image"
8640920,8641380," data"
8641380,8642100," right"
8642100,8642380," so it's"
8642380,8642680," going to be"
8642680,8643000," sprite"
8643000,8643340," image"
8643340,8643880," data"
8643880,8646140," srcp"
8646140,8647740," plus"
8647740,8648300," 0"
8648300,8649320," and we're"
8649320,8649760," just copying"
8649760,8650220," all these"
8650220,8650520," things"
8650520,8651520," including"
8651520,8652460," maybe"
8652460,8654120," alpha"
8654120,8655940," all right"
8655940,8656400," but this one"
8656400,8656820," is going to be"
8656820,8657700," rather interesting"
8657700,8658560," this one"
8658560,8658940," is going to be"
8658940,8659600," rather interesting"
8659600,8660300," okay"
8660300,8660860," so let's"
8660860,8661560," let's do all"
8661560,8661940," of that shit"
8661940,8662640," without the alpha"
8662640,8663460," just to see"
8663460,8663960," how all"
8663960,8664420," that is going"
8664420,8664800," to be like"
8664800,8666480," a rectangle"
8666480,8666960," and whatnot"
8666960,8668180," so does it"
8668180,8668460," compile"
8668460,8668820," it seems"
8668820,8669040," to be"
8669040,8669400," compiling"
8669400,8670160," so let's"
8670160,8670440," refresh"
8670440,8670940," this shit"
8670940,8673600," there we go"
8673600,8675520," so that's"
8675520,8675940," the sprite"
8675940,8677380," that's the"
8677380,8678120," actual sprite"
8678120,8678580," we have"
8678580,8680640," that's pretty cool"
8680640,8683080," so now we need"
8683080,8683660," to work with"
8683660,8684040," alpha"
8684040,8684580," right"
8684580,8685760," so we can"
8685760,8686400," just take"
8686400,8687000," the alpha"
8687000,8688600," and let's"
8688600,8689220," maybe put it"
8689220,8689720," somewhere here"
8689720,8690240," so this is"
8690240,8690540," going to be"
8690540,8691080," the alpha"
8691080,8692820," so which is"
8692820,8693200," 3"
8693200,8694380," and we probably"
8694380,8694880," want to divide"
8694880,8695700," it by 255"
8695700,8696300," so we can"
8696300,8696680," map it"
8696680,8697120," to 0"
8697120,8697520," 1"
8697520,8698400," all right"
8698400,8699080," and effectively"
8699080,8699900," what we can"
8699900,8700180," do"
8700180,8701220," we want"
8701220,8702180," to map"
8702180,8703000," this entire"
8703000,8703200," stuff"
8703200,8703740," so alpha"
8703740,8704580," full means"
8704580,8704920," that"
8704920,8705540," it's going"
8705540,8705700," to be"
8705700,8705980," that"
8705980,8707360," but then"
8707360,8707940," we have"
8707940,8708620," to add"
8708620,8710860," this thing"
8710860,8712340," with an inverse"
8712340,8713120," of alpha"
8713120,8714160," with an inverse"
8714160,8714720," of alpha"
8714720,8715280," and let's"
8715280,8715920," just repeat"
8715920,8716380," the whole"
8716380,8716800," thing"
8716800,8718360," for this"
8718360,8718620," thing"
8718620,8719180," for each"
8719180,8719560," individual"
8719560,8720280," component"
8720280,8720940," in here"
8720940,8723960," all right"
8723960,8724580," and"
8724580,8725240," so this"
8725240,8725480," is going"
8725480,8725700," to be"
8725700,8725960," 2"
8725960,8728460," so yeah"
8728460,8729600," I think"
8729600,8730480," that's basically"
8730480,8730880," what we want"
8730880,8731100," to do"
8731100,8731680," so plus"
8731680,8732820," oh shit"
8732820,8733900," this one"
8733900,8734600," is dangerous"
8734600,8735420," so maybe"
8735420,8736180," I probably"
8736180,8736640," want to create"
8736640,8737020," a function"
8737020,8737560," that mixes"
8737560,8738100," the cores"
8738100,8738640," and shit"
8738640,8739600," there we go"
8739600,8741200," almost"
8741200,8741800," so there's"
8741800,8742120," something"
8742120,8742920," bizarre"
8742920,8743560," in here"
8743560,8745620," I'm not"
8745620,8746100," really sure"
8746100,8746760," what the fuck"
8746760,8747580," is going on"
8747580,8748040," but"
8748040,8751620," yeah"
8751620,8752660," so there's"
8752660,8753460," like one"
8753460,8754820," little"
8754820,8756500," stripe"
8756500,8757100," down there"
8757100,8758760," and I wonder"
8758760,8759200," if I can"
8759200,8759920," get rid"
8759920,8760540," of that"
8760540,8760800," thing"
8760800,8761240," by just"
8761240,8761800," not doing"
8761800,8762280," something"
8762280,8763040," like this"
8763040,8763620," no"
8763620,8764420," I can't"
8764420,8765280," look at that"
8765280,8767060," so yeah"
8767060,8767540," I think"
8767540,8767880," I just"
8767880,8768620," overflowed"
8768620,8769140," a little bit"
8769140,8771160," just overflowed"
8771160,8771720," a little bit"
8771720,8772460," so"
8772460,8772960," and"
8772960,8773700," also"
8773700,8774680," the size"
8774680,8775200," the sprite"
8775200,8775520," size"
8775520,8775920," let's actually"
8775920,8776220," make it"
8776220,8776860," like 75"
8776860,8778860," let's make"
8778860,8779200," it a little"
8779200,8779500," bigger"
8779500,8780140," so here"
8780140,8780680," is the sprite"
8780680,8781620," here is the sprite"
8781620,8782200," we're looking at"
8782200,8783060," so it has"
8783060,8783880," effects and shit"
8783880,8785620," right"
8785620,8786060," so imagine"
8786060,8786820," like this thing"
8786820,8788760," actually flying"
8788760,8789100," at you"
8789100,8791760," so"
8791760,8792400," yeah"
8792400,8794540," so"
8794540,8794900," the"
8794900,8796200," the cutting"
8796200,8797100," of this thing"
8797100,8797860," is kind of weird"
8797860,8798680," right"
8798680,8799380," so we have to"
8799380,8799860," actually"
8799860,8801020," slightly"
8801020,8802020," increase"
8802020,8802980," the limitation"
8802980,8803760," of FOV"
8803760,8805820," but apart"
8805820,8806220," from that"
8806220,8806480," I think"
8806480,8807180," it's fine"
8807180,8807740," I think"
8807740,8808080," it's fine"
8808080,8808580," yeah"
8808580,8809000," so"
8809000,8809880," as you can"
8809880,8810060," see"
8810060,8810440," Z"
8810440,8811080," buffer"
8811080,8811680," is working"
8811680,8812160," correctly"
8812160,8812680," the Z"
8812680,8812920," buffer"
8812920,8813320," is working"
8813320,8813760," correctly"
8813760,8816620," right"
8816620,8817100," so"
8817100,8818900," sprite animation"
8818900,8819620," sprite animation"
8819620,8820140," would be also"
8820140,8820620," kind of cool"
8820620,8821240," right"
8821240,8821940," so"
8821940,8824140," you just"
8824140,8824860," switch the"
8824860,8825560," thing that you're"
8825560,8825860," drawing"
8825860,8826220," right"
8826220,8826640," so maybe"
8826640,8827700," maybe put"
8827700,8828880," the animation"
8828880,8829480," into a"
8829480,8830220," sprite sheet"
8830220,8831380," and just"
8831380,8831700," like"
8831700,8832000," yeah"
8832000,8832480," iterate"
8832480,8832780," through"
8832780,8833300," the frames"
8833300,8833600," it's"
8833600,8833960," all"
8833960,8834360," pretty"
8834360,8834660," straightforward"
8834660,8835760," as soon"
8835760,8836280," as you get"
8836280,8837120," all of the math"
8837120,8837960," nailed down"
8837960,8838660," there's something"
8838660,8839400," weird going on"
8839400,8839800," oh"
8839800,8840920," it's rotating"
8840920,8841300," okay"
8841300,8844280," so I got"
8844280,8845700," really scared"
8845700,8846420," away by the fact"
8846420,8846820," that it's"
8846820,8847700," rotating towards"
8847700,8847920," me"
8847920,8848160," yeah"
8848160,8849240," so when it's"
8849240,8849720," too close"
8849720,8850900," when it's like"
8850900,8852260," closer than"
8852260,8852660," the"
8852660,8854440," clipping plane"
8854440,8855100," it kind of"
8855100,8855680," gets weird"
8855680,8856180," so maybe"
8856180,8856880," we need to"
8856880,8857580," actually"
8857580,8858660," stop rendering"
8858660,8859400," it when it's"
8859400,8860020," too close"
8860020,8860640," closer than"
8860640,8860960," the nearest"
8860960,8861520," clipping plane"
8861520,8862500," so one of the"
8862500,8863080," things we can't"
8863080,8863540," try to do"
8863540,8864020," actually right"
8864020,8864280," now"
8864280,8866480," so"
8866480,8868500," render"
8868500,8869380," sprites"
8869380,8870080," where is the"
8870080,8870300," render"
8870300,8870760," sprites"
8870760,8872240," so we have"
8872240,8873120," this sort"
8873120,8873520," of like"
8873520,8876440," SPL"
8876440,8877240," which is"
8877240,8878120," basically the"
8878120,8878560," distance"
8878560,8878820," right"
8878820,8880100," so if it's"
8880100,8880900," equal to"
8880900,8881200," zero"
8881200,8882680," less"
8882680,8884700," or equal"
8884700,8885560," to the nearest"
8885560,8886160," clipping plane"
8886180,8887220," that's much"
8887220,8887500," better"
8887500,8888840," I believe"
8888840,8894300," no it's"
8894300,8895020," not doing"
8895020,8896040," anything"
8896040,8896640," but I mean"
8896640,8897000," I guess"
8897000,8897460," it's fine"
8897460,8899100," it's not that"
8899100,8899620," big of a deal"
8899620,8902620," not that"
8902620,8903300," big of a deal"
8903300,8903700," but I mean"
8903700,8904040," it should"
8904040,8904720," should work"
8904720,8906180," maybe I just"
8906180,8906820," need to refresh"
8906820,8907280," it properly"
8907280,8908660," but all of that"
8908660,8909140," is already"
8909140,8909800," like details"
8909800,8912080," it's already"
8912080,8912960," details"
8912960,8913980," all right"
8913980,8914560," so that was"
8914560,8914840," a pretty"
8914840,8915180," productive"
8915180,8915440," stream"
8915440,8915700," today"
8915700,8916240," I guess"
8916240,8917260," thanks everyone"
8917260,8918240," who's watching"
8918240,8918680," me right now"
8918680,8919360," I really"
8919360,8919980," appreciate it"
8919980,8921060," have a good"
8921060,8921360," one"
8921360,8921960," and I'll see you"
8921960,8922560," all on the next"
8922560,8923280," recreation programming"

8924940,8925320," going to start"
8925320,8926080," making an actual"
8926080,8926480," game"
8926480,8927540," like with content"
8927540,8928080," and shit"
8928080,8928340," right"

8930340,8930840," elements"
8930840,8931400," in the"
