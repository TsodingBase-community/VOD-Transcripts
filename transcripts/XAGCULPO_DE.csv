280,9960," have you ever tried to learn react i think i tried uh because i was thinking maybe i need to take like"
9960,17380," a job for react like i used to do like um what was it called freelancing and i was considering"
17380,21860," taking like a maybe front-end react job but i didn't know react and i wanted to learn it and"
21860,26060," i opened it up and i just like i don't want to learn this shit and i just decided not to"
27120,30760," maybe the time has come to learn react i kind of know how it works though"
30760,34940," i kind of know how it works so maybe we should learn react"
34940,40120," so let's actually go ahead and learn react"
40120,54260," so learn um how to create so yeah okay so you create labatone you create labatone uh"
54260,62520," all right and then you use labatone in your application okay so and uh cool"
62520,70720," so that doesn't tell you how to start your application this is very bad tutorial by the way"
70720,78820," right uh so maybe the we have to start with the installation right how to start a new react project"
78820,86340," so um so next js but i don't want to do next js i know that next js is a thing on top of the"
86340,95460," uh of the stuff uh let's go ahead and probe uh make dear react uh yeah let's do react"
95460,103580," um there we go can i just do npm init right so we're gonna just do it but i mean i already called"
103580,114680," it react so i probably have to do react hello uh world right uh npm init right so let's just"
114680,115840," initialize this entire"
115840,126700," okay okay uh okay react hello world uh version one uh i don't want to do anything in here okay"
126700,136060," test command git repository keywords author mit and yes there you go so npm uh right install"
136060,142560," react can you just install react maybe i should have actually saved this entire thing let's do uh"
142560,150300," save all right so that will add that to uh you know package json right so we have a package json"
150300,158460," thingy so there you go uh so do we have react in here so and maybe in here we also have node modules"
158460,163960," so there is a react uh and everything in here i have no idea how you're supposed to use that you're"
163960,170760," supposed to i guess you're supposed to just include this index thingy in there right to use react and stuff"
170760,176860," like that so you probably have to like bundle this entire shit right so you probably have to bundle"
176860,187100," this entire shit so i don't think uh i don't think how it works so uh yusu yusu yusu describing the"
187100,196220," eye thinking in react so maybe a reference i want an old-fashioned react right i want an old-fashioned react"
196220,203960," without this next js bullshit like i don't don't really want that uh react hello so let's actually"
203960,210320," search for that uh create the react hello world app so for people who are asking like how to learn a new"
210320,218120," thing you just fuck around you just fuck around and then you find out uh then you find out so you have"
218120,225860," like a create react hello world maybe this is what should have done okay so let's actually try to do that then"
225860,232760," so it will probably create a new folder but we'll see so uh need to install the following package okay so yes"
232760,235220," there we go"
235220,246700," we probably need to i probably need to change the title by the way"
246700,258440," uh like learning react to get job at google so that's basically what i'm doing because google uses react"
258440,266680," right so google uses react i think uh i think it does so it's what is it downloading"
266680,271540," this like um why does it take so much time"
271540,280420," it's downloading the entire universe holy shit"
280420,288300," so the the snake in the loading is agonizing that's how bad it is it's fucking agonizing"
288300,291640," typescript it's downloading typescript why"
291640,298460," why why the fuck it is downloading typescript like why the fuck like"
298460,316120," what the fuck just happened"
316120,325300," is this normal for react people say yes okay"
325300,332420," okay i'm gonna bring you here so because this is hilarious"
332420,341940," okay so we're gonna go inside of hello world uh let's take a look at the size of the"
341940,363080," um so i think i lost the instructions okay so we can do npm start uh npm run build npm run eject"
363080,376480," okay um so let me take a look so we have src uh so i didn't want to do that i want to actually"
376480,382320," take a look at js uh and there we go finally something familiar finally i can see something"
382320,392580," familiar um report web vitals okay so and then you have an app right so basically have an app and i"
392580,399680," suppose app is uh located somewhere here so here is the app so we have a header uh image"
399680,408780," logo edit code src and save to reload uh learn react and let's replace it uh with your mom"
408780,415940," right so we want to do npm start right what was that start right so i remember there was start"
415940,423160," so development server right so we want to do start um yes so yes so yes so and uh it did already start"
423160,430100," uh it's probably trying to start and it opens my browser uh right so we're trying to open the local"
430100,437040," host one of the dependencies is importing the babel import blah blah blah it's not even fucking"
437040,452380," loading bro uh okay um yeah we did it we fucking did it so yeah so that's basically react isn't that a"
452380,459180," poggers isn't that a workers i think it's pretty freaking poggers um so let me see in terms of like"
459180,471820," dependencies so this is basically everything that we need uh when i do so just dome react testing libraries"
471820,482260," why why this is part of the testing this is so weird why it is not using like official react"
482260,494700," is it some did it get hacked or something i think i got hacked so react testing so oh it's like the latest"
494700,503180," one right isn't it uh i don't fucking understand mate i don't fucking understand this is so"
503180,510560," so bizarre so what's interesting is that uh react is just a library right so it's just a library we can"
510560,519480," try to take a look inside and like um uh this thing and see how it all works it's supposed to i think"
519480,528520," uh just yeah so it's a single bundle right so it's a simply single bundle you know what i like to have"
528520,537580," can i have react like you know just just like a regular bundle that i can put in script myself"
537580,538980," right and use"
538980,548040," that would have been cool i think i think that would have been cool and this is roughly what i was doing"
548040,557480," in here i suppose i think right so because i just did package json right uh and one of the dependencies"
557480,565480," here is react right so this is just a react um but is that the right react"
569960,575000," because i want to see um because i want to see more simple example so"
575000,578840," and"
578840,584120," is that a correct react because it's who's this"
584120,592200," it's a facebook react repository but the author that submitted it in here"
592760,595160," it's completely bogus like who the fuck is that"
595160,600840," gnof is that normal in npm"
600840,610360," this is a real react is this really real react or who's gnof though"
613560,623000," right so yeah it's so weird so did they reinstall the correct thing uh so the popularity"
623000,624600," because this one is a correct match"
624600,629080," i have it's so fucking scary to use this kind of thing right so"
629080,634040," oh you you can actually um yes you installed the correct thing somebody says"
635000,644120," uh maybe uh maybe and you never know it's it's so bizarre how you like kind of never know uh"
644120,651640," right because if you take a look at me is a javascript for creating using user interfaces"
652520,652840," um"
652840,661800," and that's probably why i decided not to learn react because that i guess"
661800,666520," right that so i'm not really sure"
666520,672680," and maybe i got hacked by installing all of these modules in here so i"
672680,680760," heard that there's a huge problem with like you know supply chain attacks in npm so yeah"
682520,687240," i'm gonna have to be able to do this in here and i'm not gonna have to be able to be able"
687240,688920," to do this and i'm not gonna have to be able to do this and i'm not gonna have to be able"
688920,690040," to do this and i'm not gonna have to be able to do this but i'm not gonna have to be able"
690040,691240," to do this but i'm not gonna have to be able to do this and i'm not gonna have to be able"
691240,692200," to do this and i'm not gonna have to be able to be able to do this"
692200,693400," but i'm not gonna have to be able to do this"
693400,694200," i'm not gonna have to be able to be able to do this"
694200,696200," but i'm not gonna have to be able to do this"
696200,698200," but i'm not gonna have to be able to do this"
698200,700200," i'm not gonna have to be able to do this"
700200,702200," but i'm not gonna have to be able to do this"
702200,708200," oh this one is interesting so js tokens rejects that tokenizes javascript so this"
708200,714520," is probably what they use for the um for the jsx maybe all right so this is probably what they use"
714520,722440," for jsx all right so there's also cjs uh react the diva okay so there is different bundles here i suppose"
722440,727800," jsx runtime development okay so this one is interesting you can't really see what i'm doing in here but yeah"
728520,736600," um so yeah so this is a runtime and it's like it's not even that big of a library apparently"
736600,749480," so cjs uh so there's a jsx runtime so what is index.js uh uh-huh module export it's either"
749480,757960," depending on the production okay so this one is kind of interesting what if i run one of these things"
757960,766920," so node modules uh react index.js so it didn't do anything at all right it didn't do anything at"
766920,772360," all maybe because you're not supposed to run it from the node.js maybe from the browser"
772360,781400," reacted it's uh for some reason pushing pre-existing frameworks that use react rather than maintain a"
781400,787880," basic blank create thing yeah that's what i noticed right so i remember react being"
787880,795160," in a very simple library that people would just use some time ago uh right so and now it turned into"
795160,802760," this really really weird abomination uh so it's just like what the is wrong with react uh okay so there"
802760,814280," is like a umd thingy uh-huh so that's pretty cool uh and the question is like there is a gsx gsx runtime so"
814280,827000," maybe one of the things we can do is we can do not uh react gsx runtime js can i use this thing i can't even"
827000,837480," use it yeah because it uses like a runtime or something like that uh so yeah that like i would like to"
837560,849960," understand this thing on a very basic level on how to just like use it right so maybe we should start by"
849960,858440," creating like an index html right so let's create an index html uh i can't really make it bigger so let me"
858440,870840," maybe then start emacs um so where am i it's a react hello world probe react hello world so index html"
870840,883560," i'm gonna start with that html uh head all right head because i really want to start from from the ground up you"
883560,888840," know what i'm talking about uh i want to start with the ground up uh so this is a head you have to do"
888840,897080," that in the title right so this is going to be title so this is the title and this is going to be the body"
900360,908600," uh and uh uh in here in here in here i suppose i just want to put i want to just refer to this script"
908600,917720," uh right so but what kind of scripts can we refer to so depending so this is stuff from node.js"
917720,925880," this is stuff from node.js so we probably don't want that um so what we want is a gsx"
927960,934200," so react development react production so probably want this thing right i may try to just run that"
934200,940920," in a browser just to see how it's going to uh react right so to speak uh"
940920,951960," all right so so this is going to be development and let's see what's going to happen uh i wonder if it's"
951960,958440," going to work at all so you see it's it's referring to the process right it's referring to the process"
958440,966600," so it needs node.js um so and the process is not really a thing but like what's the thing that i have"
966600,972360," to put in the browser right so what's the thing i have to put in the browser okay so this is probably"
972360,977960," the thing i have to put in the browser right there's no process in here yeah okay so that's the thing i have"
977960,983880," to put in the browser all right um so but i can start with the development and just see how it's"
983880,989800," going to fail within the browser right so how is it going to fail within the browser uh and by the way"
989800,991960," maybe theoretically i can even do it like that"
991960,999800," maybe theoretically so let's take a look at uh the console and how miserably it fails okay so as you can"
999800,1006840," see process is not defined because it wants to be run from within node right it wants to be run from"
1006840,1012840," within node and this is not a thing that we're going to have uh right so let's actually do production then"
1012840,1019880," right so this is the production uh right so do we have anything in console um okay so it says that"
1019880,1033800," there is no such thing so okay uh node modules um react uh cgs react product production mean okay that makes"
1033800,1041800," sense um export is not defined okay so that means you can't really run just that uh and one of the things"
1041800,1049320," you probably can run is umd modules so i suppose umd modules you can just like run them in here uh"
1049320,1053560," all right so do you have processing yeah i think that's what we need in here i think that's what we"
1053560,1060280," need to try to include in the index.html and so that's going to be the thing uh-huh"
1060280,1067800," all right so this is going to be umd i remember that umd is sort of like a format of the of the modules"
1067800,1073800," right it's sort of like a format of the modules and it would be nice to do development right it would"
1073800,1079320," be nice to the development because that way maybe we have some sort of like perks and everything it"
1079320,1087880," loaded up it just loaded up as you can see without any problems right so do we have read okay"
1093880,1103800," so react is just a single file did you guys know that it's it's a single file"
1103800,1110840," that you can just include here and people say that it's a hard mode react where the"
1110840,1115240," is it hard mode it's a single file like"
1115240,1119800," okay so"
1122440,1126760," uh all right so what else do we have in here so we have profiling and stuff like that"
1126760,1135800," can i start writing react uh so uh isu isu isu react"
1151480,1158760," uh so for example what if i want to have my own application so the question would be how do i"
1158760,1166120," exactly start this application uh so here i'm gonna have a script all right so here i get i have a script"
1166120,1168280," so this is just that"
1168280,1178760," and i have a feeling that it's not going to work the way i expect it to work right so because it's using jsx"
1180040,1184920," uh right so it's using jsx uh let's not have any button in here"
1184920,1194040," um but maybe just because i included react in here maybe it is going to try to pre-process whatever it"
1194040,1201240," has in scripts in here to have jsx and stuff like that so does it refer to jsx anywhere in here okay"
1201240,1207560," did you accidentally export jsx literal instead of component uh consider using jsx uh right it's referring"
1207560,1216760," something to jsx but not too much it not too much okay so maybe one of the things we can have in here"
1216760,1223000," so there is a jsx runtime development uh but all of that is sort of like a minified"
1223000,1228600," uh right so there's also experts and stuff like that but none of that is umd"
1229880,1239080," none of that is umd uh so jsx runtime so it's using this thing um"
1239080,1243080," so can i"
1245960,1255160," just use this thing jsx different time so this is just react this is not what i want"
1255160,1269320," which is that different time i want to try to run node jsx runtime js uh it's literally doing nothing but"
1269320,1275800," what if i try to give it something what if i try to give it something so what if we had"
1275800,1282840," this thing in my app jsx like so"
1282840,1290760," um right but let's actually get rid of this expert default because it's sort of like a fancy javascript"
1290760,1298120," that requires some sort of a transpiler uh i'm gonna try to assume that maybe i can just run jsx runtime like"
1298120,1305480," this right so no js this is like a wild uh assumption super wild assumption but maybe it's going to work"
1305480,1315880," jsx runtime and my app jsx and it didn't really do anything so does anybody know how exactly react"
1315880,1325320," uh transpile jsx so people suggesting to look at the create element we can try to do that right so create"
1325320,1333640," element uh right so and it accepts type but there's not that explanation that much explanation with babel"
1333640,1340360," babel is just the additional thing on top of react so i actually doubt that it works like this"
1340360,1345960," jsx is pre-processed before the code hits the browser this is what i figured this is what i figured"
1346680,1360760," um so react jsx so the worst part about this modern frameworks and especially tutorials they do not"
1360760,1367960," explain you how this works they literally don't explain you they just give"
1367960,1374520," you okay run this bunch of commands in here and don't think about it look you have a button on the screen don't"
1374520,1382280," think about it you're too dumb for that don't think about that right so and it kind of feels offensive"
1382280,1392520," honestly right so the way these tutorials explain how this thing work is really offensive like i mean"
1392520,1397960," like you're treating me like you're treating me like an idiot like explain me how this thing actually works"
1397960,1404920," like none of that just explain me how and they're not gonna explain you because you're too dumb"
1404920,1415560," dummy dumb dumb it's just like come on this is so dumb it's like right this is it's like straight up and"
1415560,1420120," like insulting uh why jsx and um okay"
1420120,1425640," uh but how do i pre-process that uh"
1425640,1437640," okay so they say that you have to do that with babel but i mean babel is a separate project so babel is"
1437640,1443240," using something right so babel is using something but what is it using um"
1445240,1453560," is it's running something uh gsx transpiler uh gsx transpiler is there something like transpiler that"
1453560,1460840," is separate its own thing um so it's part of the babel but i thought babel has nothing to do with"
1460840,1467640," the react and gsx is just something that it plugs in into babel right it's just something that plugs into"
1467640,1474280," to babel the question what plugs into that what babel uses to do the gsx transpiler because i know"
1474280,1478920," uh right it's a separate thing and it's like it's part of the infrastructure so"
1478920,1486040," what is it using what is it using so that's the real question in here right it's just a javascript"
1486040,1492360," compiler but it's using something uh you know what i'm talking about i know that a lot of people are"
1492360,1497400," so caught up in the level of instructions they don't see the the difference but i'm looking for"
1497400,1504120," the for the actual answer so for example here's the babel okay so gsx it's probably like a babel"
1504120,1511800," uh all right so let's talk about babel compiles gsx down to uh okay"
1515160,1522600," so down to create elements yeah i see what's going on here okay babel gsx"
1522600,1532120," transform react gsx yes so how does it do that who it calls to who does it call to"
1532120,1539880," so that's the the real question it's probably calling to somebody it's calling to it must be"
1539880,1546840," calling to somebody who are you calling to view js but why is it part of the view js"
1546840,1549400," isn't"
1549400,1557720," isn't view a separate framework or something what the is going on web people"
1557720,1567800," web people are you okay i'm it's a plugin for babel it's just like oh my god"
1569480,1575560," like how are you how you how am i supposed to take this seriously like"
1575560,1582600," how are you calling yourself real software developers with this kind of like i don't understand"
1582600,1592680," uh how is this real like this is so bad okay so show me does it refer to gsx okay so it does refer to"
1593320,1601000," gsx and um there is this plugin but show me the the source code"
1601000,1611720," gsx closing element so it's literally parts okay okay so this is interesting so this is literally part of"
1611720,1616040," babel right so it's literally part of babel and it's"
1618200,1621400," okay okay okay that is already something interesting"
1621400,1623880," closing element"
1623880,1630040," huh"
1630040,1634120," generators"
1634120,1643720," wait okay so this is a generator and is that the whole"
1645160,1648520," generator well i mean it's just generator so there should be some sort of"
1648520,1655160," process i suppose so there's a printer it's a separate package babel generator"
1657560,1670840," um"
1670840,1681240," okay can i just install babel then right so it's all inside of babel right it's all inside of babel"
1682440,1691640," all right so can i just do npm npm install babel and i hope i'm installing the right thing okay so it's"
1691640,1697880," installed something i should have actually you know saved uh right so i should have actually saved it in"
1697880,1706920," here uh all right so there's a babel in here and uh it's probably doesn't have yeah right so there's a"
1707480,1710440," all right so this kind of thing uh right"
1710440,1716520," doesn't move to babel core"
1716520,1725800," so it's kind of uh interesting i want to be able to just to run it"
1728760,1733160," somebody who left this tree"
1733160,1737080," somebody left this tree"
1737080,1743480," so people don't understand that i'm not trying to achieve the end result right i'm trying to"
1743480,1751240," understand how mechanically uh this entire thing work right so"
1754120,1761480," it's kind of interesting i suppose people expect me to just follow the tutorial and get satisfied how i"
1761480,1766360," see the the logo of react or something like that but i already did that it was horrible"
1766360,1773640," it was just the worst tutorial i've ever seen that doesn't explain anything about react it literally"
1773640,1780600," doesn't explain anything about react so the closet i got to understanding is by just including umd module in"
1780600,1786360," here uh and doing like react create uh like element or something like that so this is the closest to"
1786360,1792760," understanding what the is going on i got and this is actually pretty good right so now i have this uh"
1792760,1793720," you know understanding"
1793720,1797960," go to dopamine kick from created the button"
1797960,1808120," yeah most react tutorials are due to trust me lmo yeah exactly and what's funny is that people get"
1808120,1817320," frustrated when they get really frustrated and leave the stream but maybe that's a good thing maybe we"
1817320,1824040," don't want this kind of people in here right here i want to understand right so and if we have"
1824040,1829880," jsx which is pre-processed which is pre-processed by babel right so there should be a way to call that"
1829880,1835080," babel like manually mechanically i know that you're supposed to have some sort of a bond there's some"
1835080,1839880," some sort of a magical thing that you just like call one thing it downloads thousands of dependencies and"
1839880,1846440," blah blah blah you get a dopamine hit i understand that i understand that that you all web developers"
1846440,1853080," are dopamine junkies like that i understand that but i like to understand how these things work like"
1853080,1861480," mechanically so you know what i'm talking about the whole point is making developers able to create nice"
1861480,1864520," websites without need to know all of this you're getting it wrong"
1864520,1877560," like how are we getting like proud of not understanding things like i am wrong listen listen"
1877560,1885480," they call me wrong for trying to understand things are they being ironic i hope you're being ironic"
1886680,1893640," right right so they are claiming i am wrong for trying to understand things"
1893640,1898360," where this is the state we're currently in"
1898360,1907480," it has to be like it must be a joke right so it must you're joking right you you're just trolling you"
1907480,1909320," you're you're being ironic"
1909320,1918120," like it it is a joke right so it is a joke i i'm wrong for trying to understand things"
1918120,1926360," it's not like the the whole thing is bad it's bad on purpose and if you do not accept that you are the one who's wrong"
1930760,1940360," right anyway so uh we're gonna ignore those people right so uh let me let me see so uh how do i do that"
1940360,1946840," babel jsx right so show me how to do that so this is a react transform so maybe this is the thing i have"
1946840,1953640," to install uh all right so they don't really explain you how to install this thing though right so they just"
1953640,1965560," show you this and that's about it um right so maybe uh jsx syntax plugin compiler for this babel um right"
1965560,1971720," so there's a babel standalone right so there's a babel standalone uh we not use a standalone we're"
1971720,1979240," using production you should normally not use standalone uh oh you can even use this thing like"
1979240,1986200," that that that's pretty interesting that's pretty so there's a babel cli uh comes with the built-in"
1986200,1993080," cell it can be used to compile farm song combine holy this is what i wanted uh this is what i wanted i i"
1993080,1998280," know that i'm wrong for trying to like understand things mechanically but i mean i just want to do that"
1998280,2000520," uh bro"
2000520,2005160," all right so i forgot to save it i'm sorry"
2007880,2010840," okay so let me see what we got in here holy shit"
2010840,2015320," anyway uh so"
2015320,2021400," so all right so there is a babel"
2021400,2027400," so there's another one"
2027400,2036920," in here so here is the cli so this is a babel cli so you have a bin uh and you have a babel okay so"
2036920,2042520," that's cool uh i'm fine with all of that uh i'm fine with all of that uh i'm fine with all of that"
2042520,2046760," so node modules uh babel cli bin"
2046760,2050040," babel so it is js"
2050040,2053960," all right so compilation requires a file"
2053960,2059320," or okay so let's provide you you can't see choice in this mess maybe i should actually put"
2059880,2066920," this kind of stuff like up there like i should put myself up there and uh now let's provide uh this"
2066920,2071480," thing i wonder if uh so do we have it's a my app"
2072520,2080040," uh okay so let me see what it is complaining about gsx currently um support for experimental syntax"
2080040,2086200," jsa isn't currently enabled uh all right how can i enable gsx"
2086200,2097320," so if you want to leave it as it is add uh babel syntax to the plugin section uh to be enabled"
2098840,2100680," oh all right so let's take a look"
2100680,2107480," uh-huh so at least it is explaining how to uh-huh"
2107480,2114520," so this is probably what we want so it's a saved i should have actually saved the babel as a dependency"
2114520,2123800," as a as a dev dependency right so all right okay so even though we installed this thing it still doesn't work"
2123800,2134040," uh so that means i suppose the babel should have a config remember that the babel had config babel config all right"
2137800,2147160," uh configure babel uh okay so here's the plug plugins and stuff like that can it generate uh config um"
2147160,2151720," if you want to compile node modules uh so this is for you"
2151720,2162360," all right okay so i was hoping that maybe it's gonna um oh okay you can actually put this thing in a"
2162360,2169240," in the package thingy uh by the way i as far as i know i i can do all of that from the package config"
2169240,2178840," right so um so this is a babel but it's probably don't need this thing right and can i move this"
2178840,2187560," entire thing here yeah i think i think i can so and then uh i can basically do stuff like this so i'm"
2187560,2193400," not sure if press presets are important so i'm going to make them uh like this and the plugins is going"
2193400,2202760," to be gsx right so i suppose in script uh i can do babel so maybe maybe something like let's call it"
2202760,2210040," build right so let's call it essentially build and this is going to be babel uh gsx and we're going to"
2210040,2217080," build specifically my app gsx right so and see how it's going to go so and as far as i can understand"
2217080,2224200," here we're going to do run maybe we can just do build uh write commands run builds all right so"
2224200,2228840," what do we have in here so there's some problem with the json data probably because of this thing"
2228840,2240680," um so unexpected string in json at position um react hello world i forgot to put this thing in here"
2242680,2246520," it's still where do i still have okay"
2246520,2253320," freaking json i swear to god um"
2253320,2257240," um"
2257240,2263160," so can i know uh line what"
2265400,2267960," at the position at the position will have 51"
2267960,2273720," line nine jesus bruv"
2273720,2281560," finally uh babel js is not found which is rather interesting so i would expect this thing to be"
2281560,2287720," so yeah that's kind of weird so i would expect it to be in sort of like"
2288520,2296440," in beans because i know that oh it's just babel without js okay so that's cool uh so i can just do"
2296440,2304200," it like that uh let's do it like this and all right that's cool so we could not uh find package"
2304200,2311960," babel js export it from blah blah blah uh all right so that's weird that's a bit weird i don't really know why"
2312600,2317400," um even though here's the plugin syntax js x"
2317400,2326680," so resolve virtual so maybe i have to do npm install one more time just in case"
2326680,2329560," no so that's that's fine"
2331960,2335480," so that is a fine that is fine minor friendly so"
2335480,2338680," what's up with that um so"
2338680,2346360," it doesn't want to enable the plugin is syntax jsx okay so this is probably what we have to do"
2346360,2350680," all right so run guilt"
2350680,2355400," okay so that cannot find package"
2358200,2364360," uh to to configure jsx okay so let me close this entire it's too much open things"
2364360,2377400," and uh babel jsx plugin right so didn't like i don't know why it doesn't understand that right so"
2377400,2387640," syntax jsx and just jsx doesn't work uh plugin transform uh jsx is that what i have to install"
2388200,2394760," um so what's the difference between plugin syntax jsx and plugin transform react jsx"
2394760,2402840," like what um that is so weird so to be fair this is not the state of things but the state of things"
2402840,2410680," five years ago yes because i want to understand that from the ground up like again guys i do understand"
2410680,2416760," that you just want me to follow this high level tutorial with next js or something like that and"
2416760,2423480," download hundreds of dependencies i understand that but all of that is built on top of other things"
2423480,2429640," and i want to understand from the ground up it's it's an insane thing to do like i do understand"
2429640,2434360," that but that's how i operate i don't i do understand that you're not supposed to understand"
2434360,2443000," the shit but i want to like and maybe that's the fundamental sort of ideological difference between"
2443000,2453080," me and web developers um somehow that i'm doing that i'm wrong right like it's kind of weird"
2453080,2460680," maybe like i have a hypothesis why web devs don't like what i'm doing right now i have a hypothesis"
2460680,2467560," because since i'm going from the ground up and actually trying to understand the things it exposes how"
2467560,2474200," shed all of that is and it makes people feel uncomfortable and that's why they have an urge"
2474200,2480360," to say that it's me who's wrong because we're studying from the ground up we're trying to understand"
2480360,2485320," and you're starting to see all of that dirt of that field going up and it's just like it doesn't make"
2485320,2492520," us up we can see how crappy it all is under the hood and it makes them feel uncomfortable and they're"
2492520,2499320," frustrated they don't like what they see and they really want to say that oh it's you it's not that"
2499320,2505400," the actual technology bad this is like it's it's you who's wrong it's you you you this is my"
2505400,2511240," feeling when i see these comments in the chat am i wrong or am i like like why i'm not am i not"
2511240,2518680," supposed to understand that you know like why am i not supposed to understand i think i'm supposed to"
2518680,2524920," understand that i supposed to i want to see all of that dirt and all that field even if it makes you"
2524920,2530440," feel uncomfortable i want to see all of that i want to see all of your dirty secrets and if that feels"
2530440,2534360," you it makes you feel uncomfortable i'm really sorry i'm that kind of person"
2539560,2546680," all right so uh okay let's actually try to uh to understand uh right even though some people don't"
2546680,2553640," don't like that uh babel jsx so uh there was the documentation right so babel jsx"
2555160,2559880," um why did it go with there uh babel jsx"
2559880,2562680," all right let's go"
2562680,2567240," so uh"
2567240,2570360," all right"
2570360,2580040," so somebody was actually suggesting pretty interesting thing uh somebody was suggesting pretty interesting"
2580040,2589720," thing uh so just put like a plugin thingy uh i i think i missed it i missed the comment uh so there"
2589720,2598360," was like a plugin yeah this one this is actually a very good one but isn't that how putting plugin in"
2598360,2605160," here works but i can do that i can try to do that anyway so that's a it's actually a good idea so that might"
2605160,2611640," actually work uh right so that might actually work so let's get rid of this thing"
2611640,2619080," uh let's get rid of this thing uh and it worked okay so that's pretty cool um so do we have in here"
2619080,2632840," uh so it yeah that is bizarre so it just returned that but it didn't do anything um it literally didn't do anything"
2634680,2641880," huh huh that's kind of it's kind of funny it doesn't do anything it just understands js syntax"
2641880,2651720," oh oh okay so we probably want to have this transform plugin plugin then right so we want to have this"
2651720,2662040," transform plugin uh okay let's try to maybe install this thing uh and just save dev uh right"
2664200,2676600," all right uh and can we can we do the same thing for the for the transform react js js jsx right so"
2676600,2685080," let's go and uh can i just do run build all right now we're talking look at that"
2685080,2693800," look at freaking that so we've got this thing right so we've got this thing and um yeah now we can just"
2693800,2699480," try to to to use that we can even do the following thing chat chat chat chat we can try to redirect"
2699480,2711480," that to my app uh js to my app js to my app js right and we got my app js all right so the question"
2711480,2720120," is how can we instantiate the react uh application right so and of course no not a single tutorial is"
2720120,2724360," what's going to tell us how to do that of course because you're not supposed to do that you're not"
2724360,2730520," supposed to understand right and if you're trying to understand that you're dumb you're wrong you"
2730520,2734040," this is frustrating i don't want to watch that you you're not supposed to"
2734040,2748680," so like why are you guys saying it's trolling this is not trolling this is literally how i"
2748680,2757400," explore new technology like i'm not even trolling like this is like my legit like reaction to react"
2758040,2759640," like why do you guys think i'm trolling"
2759640,2767560," like this is how i explore things i explore them from the ground up like what"
2767560,2779400," right so this is like yeah this is my genuine reaction this is how we do that without the stream if"
2779400,2787720," i were to to learn this kind of stuff um so yeah you have to do create root and root render okay so"
2787720,2795240," here's the question why not a single react tutorial shows you this thing right why is it always some"
2795240,2801800," weird sort of special tool that has thousands of dependencies and some like weird shit why they"
2801800,2809080," don't just don't show you this kind of thing like yeah i would prefer something like that so and once"
2809080,2814360," you understand these basics like how it works under the hood then you can use additional tools that help"
2814360,2819240," you automate all of that because i do understand that it's kind of tedious to do it like that right"
2819240,2820600," um"
2820600,2823320," so i don't know"
2823320,2828280," you know what i'm talking about right you know what i'm talking about"
2828840,2833320," so uh here's the html here's the react development here's this kind of thing"
2833320,2841560," and uh so people say i supposed to create a root right so let's actually start this and i think um"
2841560,2843480," right so"
2843480,2852520," we've got everything so we also have my app right so if i try to run it uh so we've got probably react"
2852520,2857400," components right so we've got react component i can do react create a root"
2858280,2863400," there's no such thing as create root so there is only create context right so is there a root"
2863400,2870760," um right so maybe there is a create context so react create context"
2870760,2881480," so uh maybe because if you go that far you're good enough to use vanilla js and something that actually"
2881480,2887880," decent to be fair yeah if i were to make a web application for myself i would just use vanilla js"
2887880,2898920," uh here we're learning react so people say react dom uh react dom there's no such thing as reactor"
2898920,2901960," so okay let's actually see what the focus context"
2901960,2903720," um"
2903720,2913240," so you have a react component uh so react create context okay so you you create some sort of a context"
2913240,2917080," and so what do you do with this context though um"
2917080,2925800," so and it's really weird like how do you instantiate a react application"
2925800,2932200," it's for the state management okay don't don't scream at me please don't scream at me"
2933960,2935240," do not scream at me"
2935240,2943480," yeah they literally don't show you how to instantiate that it's just like yeah don't think about it bruh"
2943480,2949640," bruh don't think about it uh why do we need a separate package i don't understand people say"
2949640,2955320," you need some sort of a separate package i do not understand that so people say react the dome or"
2955320,2963880," something oh try react the dome react no there's no such thing react dome okay"
2963880,2969560," that provides dome and server renderers for yeah why is that a separate"
2969560,2974680," what's the point of the react package if there is like a separate react i don't why"
2977880,2982120," why react okay so there is a react dome"
2982120,2988840," okay create root"
2988840,2995000," ah oh okay but why is that a separate package"
2995000,3001400," like i would expect react just to have like everything you need to just"
3002440,3006520," why why why why are they separate like what"
3006520,3015720," this is so bizarre holy like why uh okay so we can install this thing um"
3015720,3021560," all right so when i suppose this is another thing that we'll have to include"
3021560,3028680," uh in the final thing okay so the react dome uh all right so and of course there is a umd okay"
3029400,3036120," and this okay we're gonna go with these things there's also a server i'm sure if i care about"
3036120,3043480," this service so i'm not gonna bring it uh there uh right so this is the react i i don't understand"
3043480,3049960," why it is a separate thing honestly i don't think it should be separate thing uh but i mean i'm dumb"
3051480,3059160," uh react the dom okay so we'll get this um download the react dev tools for better developing excuse"
3059160,3071880," fuck you don't tell me what to do uh right so um you're supposed to create root and you okay so i see"
3071880,3077560," what is going on here i see what is going on so we have to have like a dev an id is going to be"
3079240,3088600," app right so id is going to be app like so so this is the app and um essentially what we're doing here"
3088600,3096040," we're going to have sort of like an entry point uh in here so this is going to be an entry point"
3097960,3114520," and um react dom create root and i suppose document get element by id and this is app so we created the root"
3114520,3122200," uh all right so and then so this is going to be const root of course"
3126200,3133480," so it's painful to watch why are you saying that this is painful and frustrating like i don't understand"
3133480,3139320," this is react this is how react works right"
3139320,3150600," i mean this is react like and i'm not even joking like because like yeah i downloaded react and i'm just"
3150600,3155880," like using it so this is react i really don't understand you guys"
3155880,3166440," are you uncomfortable just because i'm exposing the underlying mechanisms of react and you don't feel"
3166440,3171880," comfortable seeing what is actually under the hood i feel i feel like that's the problem right"
3172600,3177080," so people are just afraid of what's behind all of these abstractions"
3177080,3182280," i don't understand i don't understand you guys"
3184440,3186920," so i suppose this is how you you you do that right"
3186920,3192360," okay so uh all right"
3192360,3196360," so"
3196360,3204600," this is react this is react right um"
3204600,3213240," and what's funny is that we probably don't need babel right so we probably don't need babel uh we could"
3213240,3219240," have just like use that but i mean with babel it's a little bit easier like that right so it's it's"
3219240,3226680," just a little bit easier um so we can create maybe some sort of like a function button uh right so this is"
3226680,3231000," going to be the bottom so we probably want to return uh this entire thing"
3231000,3243080," right so this is going to be button and uh we can say something like click me and i suppose"
3243080,3249400," the way you use react if i'm not mistaken you just do something like this but you want to rebuild the"
3249400,3253640," the entire thing right so and you've got the button you've got the button that you say click me"
3253640,3261480," uh right so i really don't understand what the with all of these size this is so frustrating follow"
3261480,3266360," this stupid tutorial that downloads thousands of things don't think about it don't look"
3267960,3277960," like here's like here's the react so uh this is react right so here's your component here's your nested component"
3277960,3287960," this is react i swear to god people i swear to god my new friend they react uh okay so now we can take a look at the actual tutorials and shit"
3287960,3296040," um right so uh remember how we looked at these tutorials and they kind of assumed"
3296040,3304600," that we already have everything set up uh well now we do now we do and how can we uh handle the click"
3304600,3311400," of lebaton uh i'm a button okay so how can we handle the click"
3313800,3321880," uh do we do shed on clicks or something so here's the image well there's nothing conditional rendering"
3321880,3332600," there is like this kind of stuff i'm not sure uh rendering so do you have like an on click on click"
3332600,3343000," okay so there is on click and you have a function handle click okay so what can we say on click um right"
3344520,3357080," uh handle click uh handle click and this is the function handle click alert alert your mom oh"
3357080,3365880," let's build this and let's take a look at what it generated there uh what it generated there"
3365880,3368840," so here's the question why the do you need to react"
3371240,3383640," can't you just create like components like you know you can do document uh document create elements"
3383640,3391720," this is basically document create element it's just like why the do you need to react exactly"
3395480,3403320," i don't understand i don't understand this is like what what and look at how much stuff we had to do"
3403320,3409960," like we had to extra they have extra transpiler there's so many dependencies but this is basically just"
3409960,3419400," document create remember how i created like a framework a greater js do you remember this is basically react but"
3419400,3428920," without without the bullshit right it it even doesn't require any uh transpiler any preprocessor look at this"
3428920,3431160," shit this is how it looks like"
3431160,3444680," look at that so you have a router and different sort of routes and on different routes you have a different sort of"
3444680,3451560," DOM and DOM is just a function like this so we have diff h1 and stuff like that"
3451560,3462680," right and this is just a single file without any babel or anything like that it's just a single file"
3462680,3471480," and it's not even 100 lines of code look at that so this framework this library that can rival react"
3471480,3480680," react is less than 100 lines of code think about it just just look at that like why the do you need to react"
3480680,3488360," like i i don't understand honestly just look at that this is better than react"
3492520,3505720," i don't fucking okay so uh issue issue issue okay so something on click did you mean"
3505720,3507640," okay"
3507640,3515880," you know what's funny this kind of was not caught at the level of transpiler"
3516680,3527000," right it was caught at runtime what why the fuck do you need a extra compiler step if you can't catch"
3527000,3535560," this kind of shit at extra compilation step like i swear to god introducing the extra step and not just"
3535560,3542200," providing extra convenience for that it's it's embarrassing it's embarrassing"
3543880,3556920," your mom your mom your mom your mom your mom haha so do did i must react did i must react"
3556920,3565480," i think i did i think i did and in fact by going through this frustration and pain"
3566520,3574360," i now know more about react than an average senior react developer how about"
3574360,3586440," does your average senior react developer even know how jsx jsx looks like when it compiled down to"
3586440,3593880," javascript have they ever seen any of that they probably see all of that and they start crying like"
3593880,3605160," this is the real javascript this is the reality this is the realities the web developers don't want to face"
3605160,3609480," so yeah"
3609480,3620120," uh so somebody should create like a real react tutorial where they just throw away all of that"
3620120,3626440," bullshit uh libraries right bullshit like command line things that set up project for you and they"
3626440,3630600," just show you this they just show you how to do the thing that i just did on the stream"
3630600,3637240," or better use greater.js greater.js is actually awesome i swear to god so this is like the whole"
3637240,3643720," application and uh look how it works right i think did i even uh i didn't think i"
3645640,3651640," i think i didn't uh deploy it on github pages so let me quickly just put it like that"
3651640,3654680," git clone let's just clone it super quick"
3654680,3662680," uh so here's greater.js here's an example yet again so you just like create some images and"
3662680,3668680," stuff like that you create an entry you just append some stuff and if you open uh this entire thing"
3669400,3674680," this is how it looks like so this is the application uh right and it has several pages"
3674680,3682760," this is html has several pages you switch between the pages it has the router it reacts to different"
3682760,3691000," things and this framework uh this framework is less than 100 lines of code this is less than had it's 69"
3691000,3698760," lines of code it's literally 69 lines of code and the whole application is literally this like it's so"
3698760,3701880," intuitive it's better than react like look at this"
3701880,3713400," like just compare that to this stinky react that requires some sort of transpiler preprocessor it has"
3713400,3720840," so many dependencies this thing 69 lines of code you can do this kind of you can make a"
3720840,3727000," great shake you can make it unshake you have a couple of pages you can go home you can go here it all"
3727000,3739000," fucking works who fucking need reacts who fucking need to react bro bro just use gretcha js react"
3739000,3748520," fuck that stupid library i'm telling you uh make a counter in gretcha so what's going to be the counter"
3748520,3751880," is the thing that counts things right"
3751880,3755720," i don't know"
3755720,3760280," so it's actually a good question so let me see"
3760280,3770120," um so gretcha on click so what we're doing in here we're just doing it like that so this is going"
3770120,3777320," to be count plus one uh and how we're going to be updating the counter"
3779080,3788680," uh right so we're going to have dev uh and then so let's actually put dev in here but this is"
3788680,3793800," going to be count so and the problem here is that it's not going to update okay okay you got me you"
3793800,3796040," you got me all right you won you won"
3796040,3804920," uh so i'll have to this is probably something interesting to uh you know explore and how can"
3804920,3809080," you extend this specific shut up uh"
3809080,3820760," uh explore how we can even do that uh so can i just do h h2 maybe um right so"
3820760,3828200," i don't remember can i do like a counter right like so yeah"
3830200,3840200," so but that's interesting like how would you uh update this entire thing we can ask it to update"
3840200,3850040," itself right so we can ask it to uh maybe in in the level of the router in the level of the router to"
3850040,3860840," refresh so essentially so what if we save the router somewhere here and maybe the router the router is"
3860840,3870360," going to um something like refresh is that a good idea actually so and essentially it would just take the"
3870360,3877560," the current route and re-render the whole thing right just simply re-render the whole thing but what's funny"
3877560,3887720," is that um this counter gets baked into the diff right so it gets baked into the diff so that means"
3887720,3894200," if you even if you re-render the whole thing if you re-render the whole thing uh it's not going to change"
3894200,3901240," so you probably want to actually put it as some sort of like a function right as some sort of a function"
3901240,3909720," so that's very interesting uh that is very interesting so let me take a look at how exactly"
3909720,3918200," uh this entire thing works so it's going to go to js uh so if i have a uh deep right so what's the"
3918200,3925000," what's the diff function i didn't see the diff function oh we actually yeah okay so it's a really"
3925000,3932280," funny way we're creating those things uh okay so here's the children and we're looking at the children"
3932280,3937640," and depending on what okay so this is actually kind of cool so the children that we could have are"
3937640,3947320," strings and other things so there are strings and other things so we should take a look at the"
3947320,3953560," situation when it is a function right so we should take a look at the situation when it is a function"
3953560,3964920," so type um of type of what is the type of this thing so it is a function so maybe we have to do it like"
3964920,3975960," that else if type of child uh function and if it is a function we have to probably store it slightly"
3976600,3981640," uh differently right so we have to store it slightly differently"
3981640,3994040," so it appends the child um so if i just call the child like that so i can always append the child"
3994040,4000440," and just say document create text node uh document create text node and just child it again"
4001320,4012040," bakes the whole thing it again bakes the whole thing so i suppose uh i suppose this kind of this entire"
4012040,4017960," stuff has to become a function okay so i see what's going on so the easiest way to do it like that would be"
4017960,4030600," to turn this into a function to turn this into a function uh okay so fair enough fair enough uh well i kind of started to have a"
4030600,4037400," a deja vu i'm starting to have a deja vu uh i think i was even planning to do it like that"
4037400,4046440," i'm yeah so there's even a sync holy shit there's a sync hash and everything this is so funny okay"
4046440,4052760," uh all right so this is the router so this is the result"
4054360,4062920," and everything and everything so and this is the result that we return uh huh all right so we append"
4062920,4074680," some childs and we just return this entire thing so routes uh are some of these things and we probably want"
4074680,4082920," to turn them into functions right so essentially yeah we do it like that so we just do it like this and"
4082920,4089640," we call it as a function and because of that we probably want to do it uh like this so each of them"
4089640,4096040," each of those things become a separate function each of these things become a separate function cool"
4097400,4107400," uh so and we want to be able to maybe sync hash right so location uh-huh so it's just recalls"
4107400,4110280," this entire thing when it synchronizes"
4115240,4124920," uh-huh i don't remember where we okay so here's where we remove the child yeah we want to be able to call the sync hash"
4124920,4132040," from the router right we want to be able to do that we want to be able to do that so that means we need"
4132040,4140680," we need to make this thing part of the div how do we okay so we can just assign additional thing in there"
4140680,4151800," uh we can just assign it like that so can i just say result sync hash equal that sync hash i think i"
4151800,4160760," should be able to do that uh right i think we should be able to do okay so that's basically it right so"
4160760,4167800," essentially we can even call it refresh i think refresh is a better name for this kind of stuff"
4167800,4170920," uh right it is a better name"
4170920,4179080," so and when do we trigger this entire thing when do we trigger"
4179080,4188920," um when it comes to a do we do anything special i just realized that i don't quite remember how exactly"
4188920,4199000," this thing works uh how exactly this thing works oh hash changed okay so we assign sync hash on the"
4199000,4206440," okay so that makes sense all right all right okay there there's a way to destroy an instance there is"
4206440,4211240," uh there is no way probably to destroy this okay so i'm slowly recovering how this entire thing works okay"
4211880,4218040," so i'm so i'm super happy so i'm super happy so there is a syntax error at the example 13"
4218040,4227400," so aha so this is that aha all right so that probably means"
4227400,4231240," that we want to"
4233160,4239320," uh"
4239320,4243240," so this is weird okay so there is that so it doesn't really have to be the"
4243240,4246920," uh like this by the way it doesn't have to be like this so this is just a count"
4246920,4255160," uh-huh so i'm just thinking i'm just looking whether i did not make any fucky wacky because it says that"
4255160,4260600," there is an enclosed thing in here which is not true right so which is definitely not true"
4260600,4264360," uh-huh so this is a parent child"
4264360,4268120," so we can now move that"
4268120,4270440," outside"
4270440,4277960," hopefully i didn't remove uh too much in here so this is that"
4282120,4287080," that's okay so let me move it to a proper javascript file because this is painful"
4287080,4297400," this is painful okay so js mode all right so now finally okay i can finally select everything i want"
4297400,4304520," okay so that's cool uh all right so this is going to be just the router right so this is the router"
4305080,4313880," and in here let's let's put it like this uh-huh uh so this is the router semicolon so that should kind of"
4313880,4319080," work maybe i should put it into a separate thing but i mean it's an example it has to be there right"
4319080,4322440," it has to be like that so that's that's fine um"
4327480,4328680," so let's put it like this"
4328680,4340200," uh-huh so let me okay append child uh greater js8 uh what is that"
4340200,4350840," uh-huh so what did you like a fail to execute on node permit is not a type of node um it's coming from"
4351720,4355960," here uh show me example 17"
4355960,4362520," aha so because it's not a string okay that is understandable so that's fine we can probably fix"
4362520,4373080," that we can probably fix that so uh let's put it like this counter uh and is this how we do that uh"
4373080,4377240," right is this how we do that i think i think this is how we do that but i mean we can always do something"
4377240,4384760," like this it doesn't matter i think it's going to be recognized as a string anyway right so so that's"
4384760,4392840," fine okay counter uh all right so that seems to be working but i mean it complains now so let's go to"
4392840,4399160," the console uh sync hash uh sync hash is not a function okay sync hash because it now refresh"
4399160,4402120," it's called refresh"
4402120,4417320," all right so let me see"
4422840,4430600," that's how chat developers solve problem their framework doesn't support counters"
4430600,4436040," they just add them in real time that's fucking simple"
4440520,4451080," fuck react react uh so uh there's some problem in here so this thing all right"
4451080,4461400," uh but i suppose uh okay so this doesn't um you know switch between uh kasha hard and kasha not hard"
4461400,4469240," but i suppose we can have something like hard which is false by default right so this thing probably could"
4469240,4477800," could be const and what we can say is essentially if uh so where is kasha"
4477800,4486760," uh okay so this is a diff kasha and we can say if maybe hard kasha"
4486760,4494920," hard right so this is uh so this is hard otherwise just kasha"
4496040,4504040," uh and in here we can just remove this entire shed and here hard not hard so as you can see uh the you"
4504040,4512040," know the famous state management the famous state management you know the hardest problem in web"
4512040,4519320," development two variables the entire state right so and depending on these two variables we just like"
4519320,4525560," render this entire thing differently so it's either hard or uh you know kasha hard so let's see if it's going"
4525560,4526120," to work now"
4526120,4538120," is that a single page reactive application that uses global variables at the state management"
4538680,4549880," holy holy what the and it's as simple as that like look at that you have this variable and it's just like"
4549880,4551480," in inside of like a dome like"
4564360,4572200," to be fair to be fair this is heavily stop moving goal posts stop moving goal posts right so it was"
4572200,4577800," first how can you do count okay you can do counters but that's fucking i can move your go i can destroy"
4577800,4579640," all of you all of your fucking goal posts"
4579640,4592280," and i just proven that you are in a denial your reacted you know that you just fall into denial stop"
4592280,4605800," putting goal posts i'm gonna destroy them all i'm gonna destroy them all with vanilla javascript"
4605800,4614200," uh anyway so um i think we need to do a commit"
4614200,4624600," um so i think because because this is a very useful feature right so um uh i think i think this is a good"
4624600,4634520," uh"
4634520,4635320," uh"
4635320,4641400," but that will require also updating readme yeah yeah so this uh readme is outdated so i will probably have"
4641400,4648920," to probably have to copy paste this oh yeah so this is like the entirety i i just put the entire example"
4648920,4654120," example in there right so that's how it basically works uh that's how it basically works uh that's how it"
4654120,4660920," basically works so what did we do in here uh it look how many changes we had to make into the"
4660920,4671240," that's how many changes it required to add to the entire framework to add support for the uh you know for the"
4671240,4676840," refresher for the for the counter and stuff like that right but that now means that this is not 60"
4676840,4682440," fuck this is not 69 anymore okay so let's actually try to fix that uh yeah so it's 7"
4683320,4690840," 17 now it is still 69 so this is very important this is very important all right"
4690840,4701560," so implement counter implement counter so it's very important to keep the size of the framework to 69"
4701560,4710600," right so it is very important it is very important chat so yeah uh can you react do that well i mean it"
4710600,4718280," can but with a ton of dependencies right this thing is just 69 language code it's a 69 line of code react"
4718280,4729560," developers are fuming react developers are literally fuming uh but yeah it is as simple as that"
4729560,4738200," okay so i've been streaming for quite some time so yeah i hope you like today's stream thanks everyone who's"
4738200,4744040," watching right now i really appreciate it have a good one and i see you all on the next recreational"
4744040,4748920," programming session with azuzin i love you all"
