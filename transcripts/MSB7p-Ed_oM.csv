77000,81000," So, here's an interesting thing that I noticed."
81000,84000," That I wanted to fix for quite some time, actually."
84000,85000," Yeah."
85000,87000," Because I confuse S and TH."
87000,88000," Zhiyang."
88000,89000," Hello, Zhiyang."
89000,90000," Welcome, welcome, welcome."

91000,92000," Thank you so much."
92000,95000," So, here's one thing that I noticed."
95000,96000," Suvun only works."
96000,101000," C3301 subscribe at tier one."
101000,102000," Thank you."
102000,105000," Thank you so much for 10 months of a tier one subscription."
105000,108000," And welcome to our epic birthday club."
108000,109000," That sounds wrong."
109000,110000," But, yeah."
110000,111000," So, yeah."
111000,112000," It's, it's, thank you."
112000,113000," Thank you so much."
113000,121000," So, Suvun only works when you have these file digits in the same folder."
121000,122000," Thank you."
122000,123000," Thank you so much C3301."
123000,127000," So, it only works in the same folder."
127000,132000," But if you move to a different folder, right, it doesn't work because it cannot find it."
132000,136000," Anton Annon subscribed to tier one for two months."
136000,137000," Thank you."
137000,138000," Thank you so much."
138000,139000," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
139000,141000," And welcome to our birthday club."
141000,143000," Do we wear birthday suits in the birthday club?"
143000,144000," No."
144000,147000," I, we, you just need to wear the birthday t-shirt or something."
147000,151000," The birthday, since, okay."
151000,152000," Thank you."
152000,153000," Thank you so much."
153000,154000," So."
154000,157000," 30 years old club."
157000,158000," Yes."
158000,163000," Thank you, Omana Soyme."
163000,164000," Thank you."
164000,165000," Thank you, thank you."
165000,167000," I think he doesn't know what a birthday suit is."
167000,169000," Ah, I forgot what a birthday suit."
169000,170000," I forgot."
170000,171000," I remember."
171000,172000," Birthday suit."
172000,172000," I think."
172000,173000," Yeah."
173000,174000," I remember somebody explained me, but I forgot."
174000,175000," I forgot about that."
175000,176000," C3301 is gifting five tier one subs."
176000,177000," Thank you."
177000,178000," Thank you so much."
178000,179000," Along the king Z."
179000,180000," Along the king Z."
180000,181000," Academic."
181000,182000," Glow singer."
182000,183000," Slinger."
183000,184000," Slipner."
184000,185000," Examiners boy."
185000,187000," And welcome to our 30 years old club."
187000,188000," Yeah."
188000,189000," Yeah."
189000,190000," I remember when I was at school."
190000,195000," One of my classmates wrote a ridiculous core version of happy birthday for his girls."
195000,197000," And that was so funny to practice."
197000,198000," Thank you, Sintus."
198000,199000," Thank you."
199000,200000," Thank you, Sintus."
200000,201000," Thank you."
201000,202000," Thank you, everyone."
202000,204000," I really appreciate all the happy birthdays."
204000,205000," So, this is the problem that we can solve."
205000,206000," Just super quick."
206000,207000," Right."
207000,211000," So, basically, I don't want this executable to be dependent on that file."
211000,212000," Yeah."
212000,213000," So, okay."
213000,214000," And I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
214000,215000," I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
215000,216000," I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
216000,217000," I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
217000,218000," And I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
218000,219000," I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
219000,220000," And I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
220000,221000," And I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
221000,222000," And I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
222000,223000," And I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
223000,224000," And I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
224000,226000," And I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
226000,228000," And I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
228000,239000," And I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
239000,240000," And I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
240000,243000," I was thinking how I'm going to do that."
243000,247000," So, the idea is to actually bake that file into the executable."
247000,249000," Thank you, you're the droid."
249000,251000," Yeah, just include digit."
251000,253000," This is basically what I want to do."
253000,254000," Right."
254000,257000," Thank you, dexterlex98."
257000,258000," Thank you, Gettison."
258000,259000," Thank you."
259000,260000," Thank you."
260000,269000," So, but essentially I want to have like a meta program that uses scb to load that file"
269000,276000," and turn into a C code that then I can include in the in the source code."
276000,282000," XXD is not going to work because if I do XXD on that file, it will include PNG metadata."
282000,283000," Right."
283000,285000," But it would be way easier for me to not include that."
285000,290000," And what's funny is that at runtime, we can get rid of the STB dependency as well."
290000,291000," So, yeah."
291000,292000," So, this is something that we can do."
292000,300000," I think it's going to be super beneficial because you're going to have like a self-contained file that just contains the sprite sheet."
300000,301000," So, yeah."
301000,302000," So, yeah."
302000,307000," And I think it would be actually pretty good to do as a birthday exercise."
307000,311000," I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean, but yeah."
311000,313000," Use PPM instead."
313000,316000," I don't know if it matters."
316000,317000," I'm just going to bake it."
317000,318000," So, PPM."
318000,321000," Yeah."
321000,324000," The format doesn't really, really matter because there will be no format, I think."
324000,329000," So, let's start Emacs and let's try to do that."
330000,331000," Um."
331000,332000," Oh."
332000,333000," My son."
333000,334000," Happy birthday."
334000,336000," That TTS was funny."
336000,337000," Thank you."
337000,339000," Thank you so much for $10."
339000,341000," And thank you for happy birthday."
341000,342000," Thank you."
342000,343000," Thank you."
343000,344000," Thank you."
344000,347000," But if you want to redraw something, redraw something."
347000,352000," Well, I mean, the baking is going to happen at compile time."
352000,355000," So, the file is still going to be in the source code."
355000,356000," Shikana, thank you."
356000,357000," Thank you so much."
357000,359000," I wish you less rage in your life."
359000,360000," Thank you."
360000,361000," That's exactly what I need."
361000,363000," That's exactly what I need."
363000,365000," I've been having too much rage."
365000,369000," Probably because of the specific of my work, but it is what it is."
369000,373000," No, I do not consider that kid."
373000,375000," Thank you so much."
375000,377000," I'm heavy with the lo-fi."
377000,382000," So, yeah."
382000,385000," Essentially, the PNG file is still going to be there."
385000,389000," And we're going to convert that file to C code at compile time."
389000,390000," At compile time."
390000,391000," It was step."
391000,392000," Thank you."
392000,393000," Thank you so much."
393000,394000," Thank you."
394000,395000," Thank you."
395000,396000," All right."
396000,399000," I'm finally a big boy."
399000,400000," Feels boomer, man."
400000,401000," Exactly."
401000,402000," I'm finally boomer."
402000,405000," I'm finally boomer."
406000,407000," Okay."
407000,407000," Okay."
407000,408000," So, we need a special tool."
408000,409000," How are we going to call that tool?"
409000,410000," Hello."
410000,411000," Hello, Lumbakota."
411000,413000," Feels birthday indeed."
413000,414000," Feels birthday indeed."
414000,419000," So, maybe we're going to call it like PNG2C."
419000,421000," Sounds like a pretty good name."
421000,423000," PNG2C."
423000,424000," Yes."
424000,425000," PNG2C."
425000,426000," Yes."
426000,427000," PNG2C."
427000,428000," Yes."
428000,429000," PNG2C."
429000,430000," Yes."
430000,431000," PNG2C."
431000,432000," Yes."
432000,433000," PNG2C."
433000,434000," Yes."
434000,434000," PNG2C."
434000,435000," Yes."
435000,436000," PNG2C."
436000,437000," Yes."
437000,438000," PNG2C."
438000,439000," Yes."
439000,440000," PNG2C."
440000,441000," Yes."
441000,442000," PNG2C."
442000,443000," Yes."
443000,444000," Today."
444000,445000," On my birthday."
445000,446000," It was a birthday gift."
446000,449000," From the CISO committee."
449000,450000," Committee."
450000,451000," And pusher."
451000,452000," Yeah."
452000,454000," That was pretty epic."
454000,455000," Of them."
455000,458000," That was very poisonous of them."
458000,461000," How zoomers say."
461000,465000," Oh, that was one Siege."
465000,466000," Oh my god."
466000,467000," I couldn't understand it."
467000,468000," I'm so dumb."
468000,473000," Because my brain does not consider like one as the version."
473000,474000," of the language."
474000,476000," It considers it as a part of the name."
476000,478000," So for me as a Russian."
478000,480000," That would never come to my head."
480000,481000," Okay."
481000,482000," Jesus Christ."
482000,483000," Maybe."
483000,484000," Maybe I'm just dumb."
484000,485000," 30."
485000,486000," That's quite young."
486000,487000," Maybe."
487000,488000," It's relative actually."
488000,489000," Tell that to."
489000,490000," I don't know."
490000,491000," Nafli."
491000,496000," Thank you."
496000,497000," Thank you."
497000,498000," Who fucking tonight."
498000,499000," Thank you."
499000,500000," Thank you so much."
500000,503000," Nafli is here."
503000,504000," Oh."
504000,505000," Exactly."
505000,506000," Like."
506000,507000," Nafli is the youngest boomer."
507000,508000," I've ever seen in my entire life."
508000,509000," Jesus Christ."
509000,509000," Like."
509000,510000," When I talk to Nafli."
510000,511000," I feel like a zoomer."
511000,512000," Seriously."
512000,513000," I'm 40."
513000,514000," Oh."
514000,515000," Right."
515000,516000," So."
516000,518000," That means you're not allowed in the 30s club."
518000,519000," I'm joking."
519000,520000," Everyone's allowed."
520000,524000," I had my 3.0."
524000,525000," Two days ago."
525000,527000," We have actually a lot of people who are 30."
527000,528000," Or over 30."
528000,529000," I'm actually quite surprised."
529000,530000," Because."
530000,531000," I thought I."
531000,533000," I'm surrounded by students."
533000,534000," Apparently."
534000,535000," Yeah."
535000,536000," We have a lot of like."
536000,537000," Grown up people here."
537000,538000," Uh."
538000,539000," Kevin's."
539000,540000," Happy birthday."
540000,541000," I really like this."
541000,542000," It is."
542000,543000," Uh."
543000,544000," Kevin's."
544000,545000," Your Berg."
545000,546000," I hope I pronounced your name correctly."
546000,547000," Thank you so much for $25."
547000,548000," Thank you."
548000,549000," Thank you."
549000,550000," Thank you."
550000,551000," I'm not 30 years old."
551000,552000," Uh."
552000,553000," I mean."
553000,554000," You have to be happy."
554000,555000," That you're not 30 years old yet."
555000,556000," So."
556000,557000," Today's birthday."
557000,558000," Yes."
558000,559000," Today is my birthday."
559000,560000," I'm literally."
560000,561000," A big boy."
561000,562000," 30 years old."
562000,563000," 30 years old."
563000,564000," 30 years old."
564000,565000," So."
565000,566000," To be fair."
566000,567000," Like."
567000,568000," If I look back."
568000,570000," At how I started programming."
570000,571000," It was quite a journey."
571000,572000," If you think about it."
572000,573000," It was quite a journey."
573000,574000," We can take a look at that."
574000,575000," Uh."
575000,576000," On the github."
576000,577000," Actually."
577000,578000," Majority of my."
578000,579000," Like."
579000,580000," Journey."
580000,581000," Was documented in the github."
581000,582000," Uh."
582000,583000," Majority."
583000,584000," Not everything."
584000,585000," But."
585000,586000," Most of it."
586000,587000," Uh."
587000,588000," Majority."
588000,589000," But."
589000,590000," Most of it."
590000,590000," Because."
590000,591000," I started to program."
591000,592000," When I was."
592000,593000," Sixteen."
593000,594000," Actually."
594000,595000," And."
595000,596000," I haven't stopped."
596000,597000," Programming."
597000,598000," Since then."
598000,599000," So."
599000,600000," Yeah."
600000,601000," I think so."
601000,602000," Um."
602000,603000," And."
603000,604000," I joined."
604000,605000," GitHub."
605000,606000," Oh."
606000,607000," This github."
607000,608000," Thingy."
608000,609000," Is actually."
609000,610000," Horrible."
610000,611000," Um."
611000,612000," Can I actually."
612000,613000," Zoom out."
613000,614000," Yeah."
614000,615000," Yeah."
615000,616000," There we go."
616000,617000," So."
617000,618000," GitHub."
618000,619000," Uh."
619000,620000," Was officially."
620000,621000," Created on."
621000,622000," 2008."
622000,623000," Uh."
623000,624000," 29th."
624000,625000," Anniversary."
625000,625000," Of."
625000,626000," USSR."
626000,627000," Claps."
627000,628000," Yeah."
628000,629000," Pretty much."
629000,630000," So."
630000,631000," I mean."
631000,632000," Russian Federation."
632000,633000," Is pretty."
633000,634000," Young."
634000,635000," Country."
635000,635000," It's."
635000,636000," It's even."
636000,637000," Younger."
637000,638000," Than."
638000,639000," USSR."
639000,640000," Is like."
640000,641000," 70 years."
641000,642000," USSR."
642000,643000," Than."
643000,644000," Russian Empire."
644000,644000," Like."
644000,645000," Several."
645000,646000," Hundred."
646000,647000," Of."
647000,648000," Years."
648000,649000," So."
649000,650000," Yeah."
650000,651000," So."
651000,652000," The."
652000,653000," Russian Empire."
653000,654000," Is."
654000,655000," The."
655000,656000," Um."
656000,657000," So."
657000,658000," Yeah."
658000,659000," Um."
659000,660000," Yeah."
660000,660000," I."
660000,661000," Actually."
661000,661000," Oh."
661000,662000," My."
662000,662000," God."
662000,663000," Daniel."
663000,664000," 42."
664000,665000," Happy birthday."
665000,666000," Happy birthday."
666000,667000," Thank you."
667000,668000," Thank you."
668000,669000," Thank you for happy birthday."
669000,670000," Uh."
670000,671000," And five dollars."
671000,672000," Thank you."
672000,673000," Thank you."
673000,674000," Thank you."
674000,675000," Thank you so much."
675000,676000," Uh."
676000,677000," Yeah."
677000,678000," I started the program when I was 16."
678000,680000," And I joined GitHub."
680000,681000," Uh."
681000,682000," In 2009."
682000,684000," And I think I wasn't posting anything."
684000,685000," Uh."
685000,686000," For quite some time."
686000,687000," So."
687000,688000," 2010."
688000,689000," Absolutely blank."
689000,690000," 2011."
690000,691000," Okay."
691000,692000," So I started to post something."
692000,694000," So I haven't posted anything like for two years."
694000,695000," I just joined it."
695000,696000," Because they're like."
696000,697000," There was a hype around this."
697000,698000," Uh."
698000,699000," Thing."
699000,700000," Like you have to be on GitHub."
700000,702000," If you're an epic software developer."
702000,703000," So I joined."
703000,705000," Because I consider myself an epic software developer."
705000,706000," Um."
706000,707000," First Reaper in C++."
707000,708000," Yes."
708000,709000," Exactly."
709000,711000," And it was a visualization."
711000,712000," Of."
712000,713000," The."
713000,714000," Uh."
714000,715000," Greatest common measure algorithm."
715000,716000," For two segments."
716000,717000," Yeah."
717000,718000," So."
718000,719000," It's like."
719000,719000," Uh."
719000,720000," Greatest common divisor."
720000,721000," But."
721000,723000," Geometrical interpretation of it."
723000,724000," Uh."
724000,725000," Yeah."
725000,726000," It was written in C++."
726000,728000," It uses SDL for initialization."
728000,730000," And OpenGL for visualization."
730000,731000," So."
731000,732000," What's funny is that."
732000,734000," It uses OpenGL 1.0."
734000,735000," Right."
735000,736000," To use anything like."
736000,737000," OpenGL 2.0."
737000,738000," And higher."
738000,739000," Because OpenGL 1.0."
739000,740000," Is super simple."
740000,742000," I wonder if this shit still works."
742000,743000," Let's actually find out."
743000,744000," So."
744000,745000," And."
745000,746000," That was."
746000,747000," Nine fucking years ago."
747000,748000," That was."
748000,749000," Oh my god."
749000,750000," Uh."
750000,753000," It's been using SDL for 10."
753000,754000," Exactly."
754000,755000," Jesus Christ."
755000,756000," Uh."
756000,757000," Uh."
757000,758000," I cannot believe that."
758000,759000," How."
759000,760000," For how long."
760000,762000," I've been doing this shit."
762000,763000," Just."
763000,764000," Just think about it."
764000,765000," For how long."
765000,766000," It's unbelievable."
766000,769000," Um."
769000,770000," If you know."
770000,771000," The app programmers."
771000,772000," Use Google Drive."
772000,773000," With named versions."
773000,774000," Yeah."
774000,775000," Sure."
775000,776000," Um."
776000,777000," Oh shit."
777000,778000," I've been using CMake."
778000,779000," Nine."
779000,780000," Nine fucking years ago."
780000,781000," I've been using CMake."
781000,782000," How about that?"
782000,787000," All right."
787000,788000," Uh."
788000,789000," Nine years ago."
789000,790000," Jesus Christ."
790000,791000," Okay."
791000,792000," So."
792000,794000," Version 2.8."
794000,795000," What's the."
795000,796000," What's the."
796000,797000," Like a recent version."
797000,798000," 3.17."
798000,799000," That's how."
799000,801000," All that shit is."
801000,802000," Yeah."
802000,803000," Yeah."
803000,804000," I was using it before."
804000,805000," It was cool."
805000,806000," And stuff."
806000,807000," So."
807000,808000," Yeah."
808000,809000," It finds package SDL."
809000,810000," Find package."
810000,811000," OpenGL."
811000,812000," Then."
812000,813000," Creates executable."
813000,814000," And."
814000,815000," It's actually pretty."
815000,816000," Straightforward."
816000,817000," Straightforward CMake."
817000,818000," So."
818000,819000," Let's actually try to build that."
819000,820000," Um."
820000,821000," All right."
821000,822000," Okay."
822000,823000," Uh."
823000,824000," Found both."
824000,825000," As a legacy."
825000,826000," OpenGL."
826000,827000," So."
827000,828000," I think."
828000,829000," It didn't fail."
829000,831000," I would consider that a success."
831000,832000," I think."
832000,833000," It didn't fail."
833000,834000," So."
834000,835000," Let's try to build that."
835000,836000," Okay."
836000,838000," It's building things."
838000,839000," And."
839000,840000," It still compiles."
840000,841000," And."
841000,842000," It still works."
842000,844000," Would you look at that?"
844000,845000," Nine."
845000,846000," Years."
846000,847000," Still."
847000,848000," Fucking."
848000,849000," Works."
849000,850000," Fucking."
850000,852000," How about that?"
852000,853000," Thank you."
853000,854000," Thank you."
854000,855000," Thank you."
855000,856000," Thank you."
856000,857000," Thank you."
857000,858000," Everyone who said."
858000,859000," Happy birthday to me."
859000,860000," Thank you."
860000,861000," I really appreciate that."
861000,862000," So."
862000,863000," Yeah."
863000,864000," Nine years ago."
864000,865000," Still fucking works."
865000,866000," Thank you."
866000,867000," So very sour."
867000,868000," Thank you."
868000,869000," Yeah."
869000,869000," And."
869000,870000," Oh my god."
870000,871000," That was so long."
871000,872000," Jesus Christ."
872000,873000," Uh."
873000,874000," Jabu Bab."
874000,875000," Thank you."
875000,876000," Happy birthday there."
876000,877000," Thank you."
877000,879000," Thank you so much for 100 bits."
879000,880000," Uh."
880000,881000," Yeah."
881000,882000," And last updated."
882000,883000," Four years ago."
883000,884000," I was removing trailing white spaces."
884000,885000," For some reason."
885000,886000," Like four years ago."
886000,887000," I decided."
887000,889000," I gotta remove the trailing white spaces."
889000,890000," Yeah."
890000,891000," Uh."
891000,892000," Thank you."
892000,893000," Thank you."
893000,894000," Thank you."
894000,895000," Thank you."
895000,896000," Uh."
896000,897000," Thank you."
897000,898000," Wizard."
898000,900000," I hope I pronounced your nickname correctly."
900000,901000," Uh."
901000,902000," So yeah."
902000,903000," Uh."
903000,904000," Did they do anything else here?"
904000,905000," Does it show everything?"
905000,907000," I'm not quite sure if it shows everything."
907000,909000," I think I need to click on these things."
909000,910000," Uh."
910000,912000," Created their first repository."
912000,913000," MD5."
913000,914000," Why does."
914000,916000," It's in Haskell."
916000,917000," Speaking of."
917000,919000," For how long I've been programming in Haskell."
919000,920000," Okay."
920000,921000," Um."
921000,926000," All right."
926000,927000," So when was the."
927000,928000," 2011."
928000,929000," Okay."
929000,930000," So."
930000,931000," And."
931000,932000," That was."
932000,935000," I think I've already been programming in Haskell."
935000,936000," For quite some time."
936000,937000," When I wrote this thing."
937000,938000," Uh."
938000,939000," Nine years ago."
939000,940000," It still works."
940000,941000," Basically CPP."
941000,942000," That's why some people hate more in depth."
942000,943000," Uh."
943000,944000," Yeah."
944000,945000," Yeah."
945000,946000," So I already talked about that."
946000,947000," Because you."
947000,948000," You."
948000,949000," Basically."
949000,950000," I already showed that."
950000,951000," Uh."
951000,952000," If you program in Elm."
952000,953000," Right."
953000,954000," Whatever you wrote."
954000,955000," Whatever you wrote in Elm."
955000,956000," Uh."
956000,957000," It's not gonna compile anymore."
957000,958000," It's not gonna work."
958000,958000," Like."
958000,959000," It's just."
959000,960000," You can throw away."
960000,961000," Straight up."
961000,962000," Ready."
962000,963000," So."
963000,964000," Go for 10 years."
964000,965000," Yes."
965000,966000," Yes."
966000,967000," Again."
967000,968000," Uh."
968000,969000," So."
969000,970000," Yeah."
970000,971000," It's kind of."
971000,972000," It's kind of funny."
972000,973000," Uh."
973000,974000," People were contributing to this thing."
974000,975000," But essentially."
975000,976000," It's an implementation of MD5."
976000,977000," Purely."
977000,978000," In."
978000,979000," Haskell."
979000,980000," Uh."
980000,981000," My implementation of MD5."
981000,982000," Oh."
982000,983000," Yeah."
983000,984000," I remember."
984000,985000," I was in the university."
985000,987000," And we had a cryptography course."
987000,988000," And."
988000,989000," One of the."
989000,990000," Like."
990000,991000," Labs."
991000,992000," Was to implement."
992000,993000," A hash function."
993000,994000," Any hash function."
994000,995000," You could implement."
995000,996000," Even your own."
996000,998000," You could invent your own hash function."
998000,999000," And just."
999000,1000000," Uh."
1000000,1001000," Show to the."
1001000,1002000," To the teacher."
1002000,1003000," I decided to implement MD5."
1003000,1004000," Uh."
1004000,1005000," To the spec."
1005000,1006000," I opened up RFC."
1006000,1008000," And implemented it to the spec."
1008000,1009000," Pascal."
1009000,1010000," And I demonstrated that it works."
1010000,1011000," And stuff like that."
1011000,1012000," That was actually pretty cool."
1012000,1013000," Uh."
1013000,1014000," So yeah."
1014000,1015000," Here it is."
1015000,1016000," Here's implementation."
1016000,1017000," Uh."
1017000,1018000," Yep."
1018000,1019000," That's."
1019000,1020000," That's the thing I did."
1020000,1021000," So."
1021000,1022000," And apparently."
1022000,1023000," That was my first repo."
1023000,1024000," Ever."
1024000,1025000," On GitHub."
1025000,1027000," Imagine the planet about 26."
1027000,1029000," It's just."
1029000,1030000," That's."
1030000,1031000," That's the best hash function."
1031000,1032000," Yeah."
1032000,1034000," It's essentially identity function."
1034000,1035000," Uh."
1035000,1036000," Yeah."
1036000,1037000," That's."
1037000,1038000," That's."
1038000,1039000," That's pretty cool."
1039000,1040000," So what else did I do?"
1040000,1041000," What else did I do?"
1041000,1042000," Uh."
1042000,1045000," So in programming language."
1045000,1046000," When."
1046000,1047000," I'm already developing like."
1047000,1048000," It's like my small programming language."
1048000,1049000," I don't know."
1049000,1050000," Uh."
1050000,1051000," We'll see."
1051000,1052000," Thank you for."
1052000,1053000," Pouring hot tea on your face."
1053000,1054000," Thank you."
1054000,1055000," Thank you so much."
1055000,1056000," Um."
1056000,1058000," I could looks better than majority of."
1058000,1059000," Uh."
1059000,1060000," GitHub."
1060000,1061000," Well."
1061000,1062000," I guess I was a better developer."
1062000,1063000," Nine years ago."
1063000,1064000," I didn't know."
1064000,1065000," Uh."
1065000,1067000," So what else do we have?"
1067000,1068000," I think that's it."
1068000,1070000," There were some updates."
1070000,1071000," GSM visualization."
1071000,1072000," Uh."
1072000,1073000," And."
1073000,1075000," That's pretty much everything I did in 2011."
1075000,1076000," I think."
1076000,1077000," In 2012."
1077000,1078000," Uh."
1078000,1079000," I said."
1079000,1080000," I started to post more."
1080000,1081000," Uh."
1081000,1082000," Yes."
1082000,1083000," And I was participating in."
1083000,1084000," I see."
1084000,1085000," Um."
1085000,1086000," I see."
1086000,1087000," FPC."
1087000,1088000," So this is basically like a."
1088000,1089000," Functional programming contest."
1089000,1090000," With some of my friends."
1090000,1091000," Back then."
1091000,1092000," 2011."
1092000,1093000," That was actually."
1093000,1094000," Pretty cool."
1094000,1095000," Uh."
1095000,1096000," So."
1096000,1097000," Do we have anything else?"
1097000,1099000," I will still working on GSM."
1099000,1100000," Hyperspace."
1100000,1101000," Oh."
1101000,1102000," It's a game enclosure."
1102000,1103000," I was programming enclosure."
1103000,1105000," In 2012."
1105000,1106000," Yes."
1106000,1108000," By the way."
1108000,1111000," I was programming enclosure."
1111000,1112000," People asking me."
1112000,1113000," Uh."
1113000,1115000," If I ever tried closure."
1115000,1116000," 2012."
1116000,1119000," I was programming enclosure already."
1119000,1120000," So."
1120000,1123000," I've tried a lot of shit."
1123000,1124000," Uh."
1124000,1125000," We're the same age."
1125000,1126000," And I just started coding."
1126000,1127000," Two years ago."
1127000,1128000," I feel jealous."
1128000,1129000," Of your brother."
1129000,1130000," Happy 30."
1130000,1131000," Uh."
1131000,1132000," Well."
1132000,1133000," I mean."
1133000,1134000," I."
1134000,1135000," I don't know."
1135000,1136000," I don't know what to say."
1136000,1137000," Uh."
1137000,1138000," So."
1138000,1139000," I."
1139000,1140000," I think I consider myself."
1140000,1141000," Uh."
1141000,1142000," Like a quite lucky person."
1142000,1143000," Because."
1143000,1144000," I found my passion."
1144000,1145000," And."
1145000,1146000," Coincidentally."
1146000,1147000," That passion."
1147000,1148000," Became actually needed."
1148000,1149000," On the market."
1149000,1150000," So."
1150000,1151000," Yeah."
1151000,1152000," I could have been."
1152000,1153000," Actually less."
1153000,1154000," Uh."
1154000,1155000," With that."
1155000,1156000," Uh."
1156000,1157000," Right."
1157000,1158000," I could have had some passion."
1158000,1159000," About something."
1159000,1160000," And that wouldn't be needed."
1160000,1161000," On the market."
1161000,1162000," And I would be."
1162000,1163000," Poor."
1163000,1164000," Living."
1164000,1165000," In the babushka apartment."
1165000,1166000," In."
1166000,1167000," The middle of Siberian forest."
1167000,1168000," Hmm."
1168000,1169000," Anyways."
1169000,1170000," Um."
1170000,1171000," Thank you."
1171000,1172000," Thank you."
1172000,1173000," System."
1173000,1174000," One one zero zero."
1174000,1175000," Thank you."
1175000,1176000," Thank you."
1176000,1177000," Uh."
1177000,1178000," Anyways."
1178000,1179000," Yeah."
1179000,1180000," I would also suggest you."
1180000,1181000," Not to be jealous."
1181000,1181000," Uh."
1181000,1182000," Of other people."
1182000,1183000," Right."
1183000,1184000," And I would."
1184000,1185000," Really recommend."
1185000,1186000," To not compare yourself."
1186000,1187000," With other people."
1187000,1188000," Because."
1188000,1189000," Uh."
1189000,1190000," You cannot compare."
1190000,1191000," Yourself."
1191000,1192000," With other people."
1192000,1193000," As I always say."
1193000,1193000," Uh."
1193000,1194000," Because."
1194000,1195000," Were born."
1195000,1196000," In different places."
1196000,1198000," Under different circumstances."
1198000,1200000," They will rise differently."
1200000,1201000," They have."
1201000,1202000," Different abilities."
1202000,1203000," So."
1203000,1204000," You cannot."
1204000,1205000," Compare."
1205000,1206000," Yourself."
1206000,1207000," With those people."
1207000,1208000," The only."
1208000,1209000," Person."
1209000,1210000," You can compare."
1210000,1211000," You with."
1211000,1212000," Is yourself."
1212000,1213000," Right."
1213000,1214000," I would say."
1214000,1215000," That compare."
1215000,1216000," Yourself."
1216000,1217000," With yourself."
1217000,1218000," In the past."
1218000,1219000," Are you."
1219000,1220000," Today."
1220000,1221000," A better person."
1221000,1222000," Than."
1222000,1223000," Uh."
1223000,1224000," Where."
1224000,1225000," You were born."
1225000,1226000," Under the same circumstances."
1226000,1226000," Maybe."
1226000,1227000," I wouldn't."
1227000,1227000," Ever."
1227000,1228000," Code."
1228000,1229000," At all."
1229000,1230000," I don't know."
1230000,1230000," But."
1230000,1231000," You managed."
1231000,1232000," To start coding."
1232000,1233000," Two years ago."
1233000,1233000," Maybe."
1233000,1234000," I wouldn't."
1234000,1235000," Be able."
1235000,1236000," Under your circumstances."
1236000,1237000," To do that."
1237000,1238000," Who knows."
1238000,1239000," So."
1239000,1240000," Don't compare."
1240000,1241000," Yourself."
1241000,1242000," With other people."
1242000,1243000," Because."
1243000,1244000," They."
1244000,1245000," Are the people."
1245000,1246000," That's the point."
1246000,1247000," Compare."
1247000,1248000," Yourself."
1248000,1249000," Um."
1249000,1250000," So."
1250000,1251000," Thank you."
1251000,1252000," Thank you."
1252000,1253000," Happy birthday."
1253000,1254000," Thank you."
1254000,1255000," Thank you."
1255000,1256000," Thank you."
1256000,1257000," If you are the only one."
1257000,1258000," Who's living."
1258000,1259000," In the babushka apartment."
1259000,1260000," That means."
1260000,1261000," You're."
1261000,1262000," The babushka."
1262000,1263000," Yes."
1263000,1264000," I am."
1264000,1265000," The babushka."
1265000,1266000," Um."
1266000,1267000," I'm 40."
1267000,1268000," It gets worse."
1268000,1269000," Every day."
1269000,1270000," Thanks."
1270000,1271000," I really appreciate it."
1271000,1272000," That's."
1272000,1273000," That's exactly."
1273000,1274000," What I need."
1274000,1275000," To compare your inner."
1275000,1276000," With outer."
1276000,1277000," Appearance."
1277000,1278000," Of others."
1278000,1279000," It is biased."
1279000,1280000," Yeah."
1280000,1285000," All right."
1285000,1286000," You're welcome."
1286000,1287000," The demo engineer."
1287000,1288000," I don't compare myself."
1288000,1289000," Every time."
1289000,1290000," That's."
1290000,1291000," Why."
1291000,1292000," I do nothing."
1292000,1293000," But always."
1293000,1294000," Want to be."
1294000,1295000," Coder."
1295000,1296000," Programmer."
1296000,1297000," It is."
1297000,1298000," What it is."
1298000,1299000," All right."
1299000,1299000," So."
1299000,1300000," Yeah."
1300000,1301000," People ask me."
1301000,1302000," Whether I tried closure."
1302000,1303000," Yes."
1303000,1304000," I tried it."
1304000,1305000," Eight years ago."
1305000,1306000," Um."
1306000,1307000," So."
1307000,1308000," What do we have?"
1308000,1309000," What else do we have?"
1309000,1310000," Yeah."
1310000,1311000," I've been actually developing."
1311000,1312000," For quite some time."
1312000,1313000," Uh."
1313000,1314000," I think closure."
1314000,1315000," Like."
1315000,1316000," Recently came out."
1316000,1317000," Uh."
1317000,1318000," At the time."
1318000,1319000," And everyone."
1319000,1320000," Like."
1320000,1321000," In the program."
1321000,1322000," In underground."
1322000,1323000," Was super hyped about it."
1323000,1324000," It's like."
1324000,1325000," Oh my god."
1325000,1325000," Thank you."
1325000,1326000," Language."
1326000,1327000," Uh."
1327000,1328000," It was in 2017."
1328000,1329000," But."
1329000,1330000," Yeah."
1330000,1331000," It was actually quite recent."
1331000,1332000," Um."
1332000,1333000," Copper cased it."
1333000,1334000," Thank you."
1334000,1335000," Thank you."
1335000,1336000," Thank you so much."
1336000,1337000," For 100 beats."
1337000,1338000," Thank you."
1338000,1339000," Thank you."
1339000,1340000," Um."
1340000,1341000," Just like Rust now."
1341000,1342000," Yeah."
1342000,1343000," It was as hyped as Rust."
1343000,1344000," Back in the days."
1344000,1345000," And."
1345000,1346000," Me and the boys."
1346000,1347000," Were programming it."
1347000,1348000," Trying it out."
1348000,1349000," And stuff."
1349000,1350000," Uh."
1350000,1351000," Just to get the gist of it."
1351000,1352000," Oh."
1352000,1353000," Shit."
1353000,1354000," What is going on?"
1354000,1355000," Thank you."
1355000,1356000," I just won't read it."
1356000,1357000," Because it's."
1357000,1358000," It starts."
1358000,1359000," It starts TTS."
1359000,1360000," From $5."
1360000,1361000," But I'm gonna read it myself."
1361000,1362000," After my streamlapse loads up."
1362000,1363000," Uh."
1363000,1364000," Hopefully it will load up."
1364000,1365000," Because streamlapse is horrible."
1365000,1366000," Uh."
1366000,1367000," Closure."
1367000,1368000," Uh."
1368000,1369000," Closure."
1369000,1370000," Archeless has a few words to say about it."
1370000,1371000," But trust me."
1371000,1372000," Eight years ago."
1372000,1373000," It was worse."
1373000,1374000," Uh."
1374000,1376000," Congratulations on incrementing major version."
1376000,1378000," And thanks for the wholesome streams."
1378000,1379000," You're welcome."
1379000,1380000," Thank you for $1."
1380000,1381000," Thank you."
1381000,1382000," Thank you."
1382000,1383000," Thank you."
1383000,1384000," Rust used to be."
1384000,1385000," Like before 2018."
1385000,1386000," It was worse."
1386000,1387000," It's."
1387000,1388000," It's the same with closure."
1388000,1389000," To be fair."
1389000,1391000," I haven't tried closure for quite some time."
1391000,1392000," So."
1392000,1393000," I have no idea."
1393000,1394000," So."
1394000,1395000," Yeah."
1395000,1396000," It's so weird looking into the past."
1396000,1398000," I've been developing this thing occasionally."
1398000,1399000," Because it was like my."
1399000,1401000," First main project."
1401000,1402000," And it was like."
1402000,1404000," Working on it with other people."
1404000,1405000," It was so cool."
1405000,1407000," I felt like a part of something."
1407000,1408000," You know."
1408000,1409000," Big."
1409000,1410000," Part of a team."
1410000,1411000," Part."
1411000,1412000," Part of an open source team."
1412000,1413000," Uh."
1413000,1414000," Or something."
1414000,1415000," Or some."
1415000,1416000," Some other thing."
1416000,1417000," That I don't remember."
1417000,1418000," Oh yeah."
1418000,1419000," It's actually a failed project."
1419000,1420000," Okay."
1420000,1422000," So I wasn't posting on 2012 too much."
1422000,1424000," But what about 2013?"
1424000,1427000," Now where I started to post some shit."
1427000,1429000," I actually started my own."
1429000,1430000," Like website."
1430000,1431000," That died out."
1431000,1432000," And some other stuff."
1432000,1433000," Uh."
1433000,1434000," What else I was working."
1434000,1435000," I was working."
1435000,1437000," Some private repositories."
1437000,1439000," I don't remember that."
1439000,1440000," But yeah."
1440000,1441000," Okay."
1441000,1442000," 2014."
1442000,1444000," And."
1444000,1445000," This is."
1445000,1447000," Oh shit."
1447000,1449000," 2014."
1449000,1451000," I remember."
1451000,1453000," Streaming this project."
1453000,1454000," I remember."
1454000,1455000," I remember."
1455000,1456000," Streaming this project."
1456000,1457000," So that means."
1457000,1458000," I started to stream."
1458000,1459000," Like generally."
1459000,1460000," In 2014."
1460000,1461000," I actually started to stream."
1461000,1462000," Six years ago."
1462000,1464000," Oh shit."
1464000,1465000," Yeah."
1465000,1466000," Apparently."
1466000,1467000," Yeah."
1467000,1468000," I think."
1468000,1469000," In 2014."
1469000,1470000," I started to stream."
1470000,1471000," Because."
1471000,1472000," I clearly remember."
1472000,1473000," How."
1473000,1474000," I was streaming."
1474000,1475000," This specific project."
1475000,1476000," Uh."
1476000,1477000," Veterans Chamber."
1477000,1478000," Yeah."
1478000,1479000," I mean."
1479000,1480000," I think."
1480000,1481000," We need to wait."
1481000,1482000," Until 10 years."
1482000,1483000," Uh."
1483000,1484000," And after that."
1484000,1485000," We'll see."
1485000,1486000," And."
1486000,1487000," This is where."
1487000,1488000," I created."
1488000,1489000," Orc."
1489000,1490000," Clip link."
1490000,1491000," And then."
1491000,1492000," At the end of the year."
1492000,1493000," I think."
1493000,1494000," This is around."
1494000,1495000," The time."
1495000,1496000," I actually moved."
1496000,1497000," To Novosibirsk."
1497000,1498000," Yeah."
1498000,1499000," Up until."
1499000,1500000," That time."
1500000,1501000," I was living."
1501000,1502000," In a completely different city."
1502000,1503000," Uh."
1503000,1504000," Exactly."
1504000,1505000," I'm finally."
1505000,1506000," A boomer."
1506000,1507000," Did you still have."
1507000,1508000," The first one."
1508000,1509000," Yes."
1509000,1510000," I do have it."
1510000,1511000," Unfortunately."
1511000,1512000," It was in Russian."
1512000,1513000," It is in Russian."
1513000,1514000," I can."
1514000,1515000," Maybe."
1515000,1516000," Um."
1516000,1517000," Uh."
1517000,1518000," It's."
1518000,1519000," It's privated."
1519000,1520000," In my."
1520000,1521000," Personal YouTube channel."
1521000,1522000," I can make it public."
1522000,1523000," But I'm not sure."
1523000,1524000," If anyone would."
1524000,1525000," Understand it."
1525000,1526000," And."
1526000,1527000," You know."
1527000,1528000," What I was developing there."
1528000,1529000," You know."
1529000,1530000," What I was developing there."
1530000,1531000," I was developing."
1531000,1532000," A Pac-Max."
1532000,1533000," In Pac-Max."
1533000,1534000," Uh."
1534000,1535000," Uh."
1535000,1536000," Uh."
1536000,1537000," Pac-Max."
1537000,1538000," It's basically."
1538000,1539000," The."
1539000,1540000," Pac-Man."
1540000,1541000," In Emacs."
1541000,1542000," The thing."
1542000,1543000," That I actually."
1543000,1544000," Oh my god."
1544000,1545000," It's."
1545000,1546000," It's."
1546000,1547000," Pac-Max."
1547000,1547000," Oh my."
1547000,1548000," I cannot type."
1548000,1549000," Because I'm too old."
1549000,1550000," Because I'm literally."
1550000,1551000," A boomer."
1551000,1552000," You go to Moscow."
1552000,1553000," Sometimes."
1553000,1554000," No."
1554000,1555000," I've never been to Moscow."
1555000,1556000," I'm sorry."
1556000,1557000," Uh."
1557000,1558000," Yeah."
1558000,1559000," So."
1559000,1560000," This is what I started."
1560000,1561000," To stream."
1561000,1562000," I developed."
1562000,1563000," This thing."
1563000,1564000," In Emacs."
1564000,1565000," Goddamn."
1565000,1565000," Like."
1565000,1566000," I used to make."
1566000,1567000," Such epic things."
1567000,1568000," I don't think."
1568000,1569000," I'm creating."
1569000,1570000," Such epic things."
1570000,1571000," Anymore."
1571000,1572000," Like."
1572000,1573000," I think."
1573000,1574000," The things."
1574000,1575000," Feel boring."
1575000,1576000," I don't know."
1576000,1577000," Compared to."
1577000,1578000," What I used to do."
1578000,1579000," Maybe."
1579000,1580000," It looks epic."
1580000,1581000," Yeah."
1581000,1582000," Exactly."
1582000,1583000," Anyway."
1583000,1584000," Um."
1584000,1585000," Gnome."
1585000,1585000," Yeah."
1585000,1586000," I was using."
1586000,1587000," Gnome."
1587000,1588000," Yeah."
1588000,1589000," I was using."
1589000,1590000," Gnome."
1590000,1591000," At the time."
1591000,1592000," So."
1592000,1593000," Speaking of these."
1593000,1594000," This was."
1594000,1595000," Supposed to be."
1595000,1596000," Like."
1596000,1597000," A music game."
1597000,1598000," As you make."
1598000,1599000," SFML."
1599000,1600000," And."
1600000,1601000," This thing."
1601000,1602000," Apparently."
1602000,1603000," Like."
1603000,1604000," XML."
1604000,1605000," Parsing library."
1605000,1606000," Okay."
1606000,1607000," That's."
1607000,1608000," That's really weird."
1608000,1609000," But."
1609000,1610000," Whatever."
1610000,1611000," Let's take a look at it."
1611000,1612000," We can see."
1612000,1613000," If it still works."
1613000,1614000," Let's actually."
1614000,1615000," Try to build it."
1615000,1616000," Let's try to build it."
1616000,1617000," So."
1617000,1618000," On."
1618000,1619000," Bitwave."
1619000,1620000," Sorry."
1620000,1621000," It's supposed to be."
1621000,1622000," A music game."
1622000,1623000," I still."
1623000,1624000," I am."
1624000,1625000," Still have an opponent."
1625000,1626000," Thank you."
1626000,1627000," Mark."

1630000,1631000," That she still use."
1631000,1632000," Now."
1632000,1633000," I think."
1633000,1634000," Yes."
1634000,1635000," Yes."
1635000,1636000," I think."
1636000,1637000," Everything."
1637000,1638000," I developed."
1638000,1639000," Starting from."
1639000,1640000," In."
1640000,1641000," When I moved."
1641000,1642000," To Nova."
1642000,1643000," Sibisk."
1643000,1644000," Was developed."
1644000,1645000," On."
1645000,1646000," This PC."
1646000,1647000," And."
1647000,1648000," The other one."
1648000,1649000," I actually."
1649000,1650000," Have two."
1650000,1651000," Laptops."
1651000,1652000," Uh."
1652000,1653000," Yeah."
1653000,1654000," I'm starting."
1654000,1655000," To feel like."
1655000,1656000," A blast wave."
1656000,1657000," To be fair."
1657000,1658000," Jesus Christ."
1658000,1659000," Nothing."
1659000,1660000," Changed."
1660000,1661000," It's so."
1661000,1662000," Interesting."
1662000,1663000," It's so sad."
1663000,1664000," At the same time."
1664000,1665000," Don't take."
1665000,1666000," The."
1666000,1667000," China."
1667000,1668000," Siberian."
1668000,1668000," Express."
1668000,1669000," Uh."
1669000,1670000," Um."
1670000,1671000," Anyway."
1671000,1672000," So."
1672000,1673000," Uh."
1673000,1674000," I think."
1674000,1675000," I."
1675000,1676000," Uh."
1676000,1677000," Cloned."
1677000,1678000," Everything."
1678000,1679000," I installed."
1679000,1680000," A cell."
1680000,1681000," I installed."
1681000,1682000," Why did I install."
1682000,1683000," A cell."
1683000,1684000," Uh."
1684000,1685000," Do you guys know."
1685000,1686000," What that is."
1686000,1687000," Do you guys know."
1687000,1688000," What it is."
1688000,1689000," Like."
1689000,1690000," There is."
1690000,1691000," Like."
1691000,1692000," A such utility."
1692000,1693000," As."
1693000,1694000," This is a joke."
1694000,1695000," Essentially."
1695000,1696000," If you mistype."
1696000,1697000," A cell."
1697000,1698000," It will."
1698000,1699000," Start the train."
1699000,1700000," And you won't be able."
1700000,1701000," To control."
1701000,1702000," See it."
1702000,1703000," And or nothing."
1703000,1704000," You will have to wait."
1704000,1705000," Until it goes."
1705000,1706000," To the end of the screen."
1706000,1707000," It's because of me."
1707000,1708000," Uh."
1708000,1709000," I'm sorry."
1709000,1710000," What."
1710000,1711000," What are you sorry for?"
1711000,1712000," I'm not."
1712000,1713000," I'm not sure."
1713000,1714000," Don't be sorry."
1714000,1715000," Everything's okay."
1715000,1716000," So yeah."
1716000,1717000," Did I install this shit."
1717000,1718000," What if my."
1718000,1719000," Well."
1719000,1720000," It's."
1720000,1721000," It will not stop."
1721000,1722000," Uh."
1722000,1723000," Until."
1723000,1724000," It goes to the end."
1724000,1725000," I asked to install a cell."
1725000,1726000," Ah."
1726000,1727000," Okay."
1727000,1728000," I forgot."
1728000,1729000," I already switched the context."
1729000,1730000," I'm sorry."
1730000,1731000," Uh."
1731000,1732000," All right."
1732000,1733000," So let's actually try to build this thing."
1733000,1734000," And see if it still works."
1734000,1735000," Um."
1735000,1736000," As far as I can remember."
1736000,1737000," It even."
1737000,1738000," Has sounds and shit."
1738000,1739000," Uh."
1739000,1740000," So let's try to configure."
1740000,1741000," I'm not sure if I have SFML."
1741000,1742000," I do not have SFML."
1742000,1743000," Okay."
1743000,1744000," Let's search for SFML."
1744000,1745000," Let's search for SFML."
1745000,1746000," Uh."
1746000,1747000," Maybe deep SFML."
1747000,1748000," Depth."
1748000,1749000," Do we have something like that?"
1749000,1750000," Yeah."
1750000,1751000," We do."
1751000,1752000," All right."
1752000,1754000," Do you have the fuck installed?"
1754000,1755000," It's pretty good."
1755000,1756000," Uh."
1756000,1757000," No."
1757000,1758000," But I know what it."
1758000,1759000," What that is."
1759000,1760000," Mm."
1760000,1761000," Mm."
1761000,1762000," Oh."
1762000,1763000," God damn it."
1763000,1764000," I forgot my password."
1764000,1765000," Apparently."
1765000,1766000," Oh shit."
1766000,1768000," And it wants to install shit on Python."
1768000,1769000," Well then."
1769000,1770000," I mean."
1770000,1771000," It's my birthday today."
1771000,1773000," So let's just install Python."
1773000,1774000," Um."
1774000,1777000," Did you switch into Debian?"
1777000,1778000," Well."
1778000,1779000," Of course."
1779000,1780000," Like."
1780000,1781000," I'm 30 years old boomer."
1781000,1782000," And guess."
1782000,1785000," What is the perfect distro for a 30 years old boomer?"
1785000,1786000," Debian stale."
1786000,1787000," Obviously."
1787000,1788000," Fucking boomer distro."
1788000,1789000," Boomer distro."
1789000,1790000," So."
1790000,1791000," Haha."
1791000,1792000," Haha."
1792000,1793000," Well."
1793000,1794000," I mean."
1794000,1795000," Slackware is even more boomer."
1795000,1796000," Yeah."
1796000,1797000," I agree with that."
1797000,1798000," I used to use Slackware by the way."
1798000,1799000," Haha."
1799000,1800000," Ah."
1800000,1803000," I actually unironically used to use Slackware."
1803000,1805000," It was fun."
1805000,1806000," Um."
1806000,1808000," And what's funny is that."
1808000,1809000," Uh."
1809000,1810000," Uh."
1810000,1811000," Hello."
1811000,1812000," What's funny is that."
1812000,1813000," Uh."
1813000,1814000," I'm using Debian."
1814000,1816000," But I use it as Slackware."
1816000,1817000," Because."
1817000,1820000," Quite often I need a new versions of software."
1820000,1822000," And I build them from scratch manually."
1822000,1825000," Just like you would do in the old Slackware."
1825000,1826000," Uh."
1826000,1829000," Remember that these days in Slackware they introduce a package manager."
1829000,1830000," So."
1830000,1832000," You can just use their package manager or something."
1832000,1834000," But that's not authentic Slackware experience."
1834000,1837000," In Slackware you're supposed to build everything yourself."
1837000,1838000," Fucking."
1838000,1839000," Manually."
1839000,1840000," Um."
1840000,1841000," Thank you."
1841000,1842000," Uh."
1842000,1842000," Scarface."
1842000,1843000," Thank you."
1843000,1844000," Thank you."
1844000,1845000," Just use Arch."
1845000,1846000," Remove all the pain of having old packages."
1846000,1847000," I mean."
1847000,1848000," It adds its own pain."
1848000,1849000," I used Arch for quite some times."
1849000,1850000," Yeah."
1850000,1851000," Yeah."
1851000,1852000," Exactly."
1852000,1853000," It gives new pain."
1853000,1854000," LFC."
1854000,1855000," I was considering doing LFC."
1855000,1856000," For LFC."
1856000,1857000," I just."
1857000,1858000," I looked into it."
1858000,1859000," And I was thinking."
1859000,1860000," Nah."
1860000,1861000," I have better things to do with my life."
1861000,1862000," I'm sorry."
1862000,1863000," Um."
1863000,1864000," At some point."
1864000,1865000," You."
1865000,1867000," You sort of grew out of that phase."
1867000,1868000," Of playing with distress."
1868000,1870000," And you just want to program."
1870000,1871000," Um."
1871000,1872000," Like."
1872000,1873000," I just grew out of that phase."
1873000,1876000," It's not interesting for me to jump between the distress anymore."
1876000,1877000," I just want to program."
1877000,1879000," I mean."
1879000,1880000," LFS."
1880000,1881000," I."
1881000,1882000," Keep confusing S and C."
1882000,1884000," Because I'm a Russian cooter."
1884000,1885000," All right."
1885000,1885000," So."
1885000,1886000," Uh."
1886000,1887000," Let's try to reconfigure that one more time."
1887000,1888000," Let's try to."
1888000,1889000," Uh."
1889000,1889000," Okay."
1889000,1890000," So."
1890000,1891000," I also need to install."
1891000,1892000," Pagi XML."
1892000,1894000," I have no idea what the fuck is Pagi XML."
1894000,1895000," And."
1895000,1897000," I didn't know why the fuck I was using that."
1897000,1899000," But apparently I was using that."
1899000,1900000," Okay."
1900000,1901000," And I do have that."
1901000,1902000," Which is nice."
1902000,1903000," Pagi XML."
1903000,1904000," Yes."
1904000,1905000," Pagi XML indeed."
1905000,1906000," Pagi XML indeed."
1906000,1907000," Pagi XML indeed."
1907000,1908000," Pagi XML indeed."
1908000,1909000," Uh."
1909000,1911000," All right."
1911000,1914000," Bitwave doesn't compile on FreeBSD."
1914000,1915000," Well."
1915000,1917000," I'm sorry about that."
1917000,1918000," I."
1918000,1920000," Didn't really consider."
1920000,1922000," FreeBSD as a platform."
1922000,1924000," When I was developing this thing."
1924000,1925000," I'm going to be stop being fun."
1925000,1926000," Instead of being a tool."
1926000,1927000," That's a grow up move."
1927000,1928000," I guess so."
1928000,1929000," To prepare."
1929000,1931000," Arch had a period a few years ago."
1931000,1933000," Where things broke quite often."
1933000,1935000," That has not happened in a long time."
1935000,1936000," And it's very stable."
1936000,1937000," I think I heard that somewhere."
1937000,1939000," When I was programming in Rust."
1939000,1940000," Anyways."
1940000,1941000," Uh."
1941000,1942000," So."
1942000,1943000," I think everything is configured."
1943000,1944000," And let's try to build that."
1944000,1945000," And see."
1945000,1946000," How it works."
1946000,1947000," So."
1947000,1948000," Okay."
1948000,1949000," So."
1949000,1950000," Apparently."
1950000,1951000," I separated logic."
1951000,1952000," Into a separate library."
1952000,1953000," And I'm going to have."
1953000,1954000," Like."
1954000,1955000," Several executables."
1955000,1957000," Look how slow it compiles."
1957000,1959000," Separate compilation and shit."
1959000,1960000," God damn it."
1960000,1965000," And."
1965000,1966000," It doesn't link properly."
1966000,1970000," Does it fail with the same reason."
1970000,1971000," For you."
1974000,1975000," Is that because."
1975000,1976000," Yeah."
1976000,1977000," Maybe."
1977000,1978000," Maybe."
1978000,1979000," Maybe the."
1979000,1980000," XML library version."
1980000,1981000," Is actually."
1981000,1982000," Completely different today."
1982000,1983000," Maybe it's too new."
1983000,1987000," Oh."
1987000,1988000," I see."
1988000,1989000," Well."
1989000,1990000," Apparently."
1990000,1991000," C++ is not as stable."
1991000,1992000," As everyone thought."
1992000,1993000," But."
1993000,1994000," It feels like."
1994000,1995000," For me."
1995000,1996000," At least."
1996000,1997000," The version of this library."
1997000,1998000," Is actually too new."
1998000,1999000," Considering that."
1999000,2000000," I'm on Debian's tail."
2000000,2001000," But that's a very old code base."
2001000,2002000," It's."
2002000,2003000," That's a very cold."
2003000,2004000," Old code base."
2004000,2005000," So."
2005000,2006000," Anyways."
2006000,2007000," So."
2007000,2008000," Let's actually."
2008000,2009000," Continue."
2009000,2010000," And maybe."
2010000,2011000," Take a look."
2011000,2012000," At something else."
2012000,2013000," Uh."
2013000,2014000," Nothing."
2014000,2015000," Particularly."
2015000,2016000," Interesting."
2016000,2017000," So."
2017000,2018000," In 2015."
2018000,2019000," Of other things."
2019000,2020000," Yeah."
2020000,2021000," Oh."
2021000,2022000," My God."
2022000,2023000," Five plus eight."
2023000,2024000," Thank you."
2024000,2025000," For."
2025000,2026000," One thousand beats."
2026000,2027000," Thank you."
2027000,2028000," Thank you."
2028000,2029000," Thank you."
2029000,2030000," Thank you so much."
2030000,2031000," Time to install."
2031000,2032000," Jesse."
2032000,2033000," Yeah."
2033000,2034000," Probably."
2034000,2035000," Okay."
2035000,2036000," I've been developing a lot of shit."
2036000,2037000," That's for sure."
2037000,2038000," It's actually too much."
2038000,2039000," Effort to go through all that."
2039000,2040000," Uh."
2040000,2042000," And I usually post like everything that I developed."
2042000,2044000," And my commit history is insane."
2044000,2046000," And I don't even try to maintain it that way."
2046000,2047000," Um."
2047000,2048000," Um."
2048000,2049000," What can you do with beats?"
2049000,2050000," Uh."
2050000,2051000," Essentially."
2051000,2053000," They get converted into sense for me."
2053000,2054000," As far as I know."
2054000,2055000," But for the viewers."
2055000,2056000," They cost a little bit more than sense."
2056000,2059000," Because Twitch needs to make money off of them."
2059000,2060000," Uh."
2060000,2062000," I think I'm a."
2062000,2063000," Not to brag or anything."
2063000,2065000," But I think in top three."
2065000,2066000," Uh."
2066000,2067000," Like commiters in Russia."
2067000,2068000," Um."
2068000,2069000," Top."
2069000,2070000," Commit."
2070000,2071000," GitHub."
2071000,2072000," Um."
2072000,2073000," Okay."
2073000,2074000," What about Russia?"
2074000,2075000," Yeah."
2075000,2076000," I'm third one."
2076000,2077000," Unfortunately."
2077000,2078000," Yeah."
2078000,2079000," I'm third one."
2079000,2080000," Unfortunately."
2080000,2081000," Yeah."
2081000,2082000," God damn it."
2082000,2083000," I'm third one."
2083000,2084000," But it is what it is."
2084000,2085000," And again."
2085000,2086000," I don't do that intentionally."
2086000,2087000," I'm just doing my thing."
2087000,2088000," And apparently."
2088000,2089000," That generates a lot of commits."
2089000,2090000," For some reason."
2090000,2091000," Um."
2091000,2092000," But yeah."
2092000,2093000," It is what it is."
2093000,2094000," And again."
2094000,2095000," I don't do that intentionally."
2095000,2096000," I'm just doing my thing."
2096000,2097000," And apparently."
2097000,2098000," That generates a lot of commits."
2098000,2099000," For some reason."
2099000,2100000," Um."
2100000,2101000," But yeah."
2101000,2103000," It is what it is."
2103000,2105000," All right."
2105000,2106000," So."
2106000,2107000," Yeah."
2107000,2108000," That was a pretty cool journey."
2108000,2109000," I think."
2109000,2111000," Starting from."
2111000,2112000," 2006."
2112000,2113000," Up until today."
2113000,2114000," And."
2114000,2115000," Um."
2115000,2117000," I think how."
2117000,2118000," I think."
2118000,2119000," Like."
2119000,2120000," A lot of."
2120000,2121000," Other interesting stuff."
2121000,2122000," Awaits me ahead."
2122000,2123000," Right."
2123000,2124000," So."
2124000,2125000," Because."
2125000,2126000," Um."
2126000,2127000," I know that I say."
2127000,2128000," To not compare yourself."
2128000,2129000," To other people."
2129000,2130000," But."
2130000,2131000," Uh."
2131000,2132000," Lindra Braga."
2132000,2133000," Happy birthday."
2133000,2134000," Thank you."
2134000,2135000," Thank you so much."
2135000,2136000," For happy birthday."
2136000,2137000," And thank you for 300 bits."
2137000,2138000," For example."
2138000,2139000," As far as I know."
2139000,2140000," Like."
2140000,2141000," John Blow."
2141000,2142000," Right now."
2142000,2143000," Is 48."
2143000,2144000," So."
2144000,2145000," That means."
2145000,2146000," He had."
2146000,2147000," 18."
2147000,2148000," More years."
2148000,2149000," Of programming."
2149000,2150000," So."
2150000,2151000," In that state."
2151000,2152000," Right now."
2152000,2153000," At what state."
2153000,2154000," I'm going to be."
2154000,2155000," In 18 years."
2155000,2156000," When it will."
2156000,2157000," Be as old."
2157000,2158000," As John Blow."
2158000,2159000," For example."
2159000,2160000," And what."
2160000,2161000," I will be creating."
2161000,2162000," That's actually."
2162000,2163000," Interesting."
2163000,2164000," To think about."
2164000,2165000," Um."
2165000,2166000," Imagine."
2166000,2167000," G-Wing."
2167000,2168000," Money."
2168000,2169000," To Twitch."
2169000,2170000," Yeah."
2170000,2171000," Imagine that."
2171000,2172000," Thank you."
2172000,2173000," So much."
2173000,2174000," For 69."
2174000,2175000," Dollars."
2175000,2176000," Very nice."
2176000,2177000," Thank you."
2177000,2178000," Thank you."
2178000,2179000," Thank you."
2179000,2180000," So."
2180000,2181000," Yeah."
2181000,2182000," That would be cool."
2182000,2183000," So."
2183000,2184000," I don't plan to stop programming."
2184000,2185000," Even though."
2185000,2186000," Sometimes."

2287240,2293560," to play in a particular read rhythm but you don't know the rhythm you have to actually figure it out"
2293560,2297800," and once you figure it out you start playing it you can actually beat the level so that was the"
2297800,2302600," idea i never actually managed to implement it because i didn't really have much experience so"
2302600,2308840," i feel the amount of money that cloud engineer etc get is extremely"
2308840,2313640," disproportionate towards software engineers and the uh engine room is getting paid i don't know"
2313640,2321880," what you think setting i'm trying not to think about that i studied in 90s with dos and turbo pascal"
2321880,2332200," oh my god yes i didn't start in dos but i did start in turbo pascal because a lot of like schools in"
2332200,2338600," russia still use turbo pascal for teaching programming to this day as well even though"
2338600,2343400," they're on windows and stuff like that they still use turbo pascal oh you know that you're from russia"
2343400,2355080," right so yeah probably um um we can uh have you seen java 2k fantastic language uh no i haven't seen it"
2355080,2357240," let me take a look um"
2357240,2367960," the new programming language for speech uh i'm not that interested in new programming languages i'm sorry"
2367960,2373160," but thank you thank you thank you for suggesting all right so what we wanted to do we wanted to actually"
2373160,2382600," turn png file into a c code that was our goal so we have a png file right so here is the png file"
2382600,2389400," and i just wanted to turn it into the c code basically into array of bytes it's a joke post oh okay so i mean"
2391240,2399880," uh very well then so we're gonna accept uh the arguments so you know i'm gonna actually use my"
2399880,2405800," regular paradigm of shifting so i'm gonna accept all of these arguments uh right but i'm gonna accept"
2405800,2414200," them by the pointer and what shift essentially does uh uh it just shifts the argument and i suppose returns"
2414200,2425640," you one of them like this yeah um i said it with uh stupid begin and language as well uh i hated pascal"
2425640,2435080," on uni uh as it was too stupefied just like basic uh probably i guess i actually studied to program in"
2435080,2443080," pascal by myself first so i didn't develop any bad association with that uh with that language as a lot"
2443080,2451960," of people did when they were taught that language in school so um students became old careful yes exactly"
2451960,2457800," hello cpp power programming welcome to stream my university used to teach uh scheme as the first"
2457800,2464200," language for students that sounds interesting hmm uh so never like them forgot them to continue to see"
2464200,2476200," with c and plus plus um all right so let's implement that shift um essentially uh i expect args i'm gonna"
2476200,2482520," even assert that args to be greater than zero otherwise we won't be able to shift or anything"
2482520,2488600," and to do that we'll need to have some sort of assert thing here so after that uh what's going to be"
2488600,2500680," the result the result is going to be like this it's going to be our gv uh i uh i think just zero right"
2500680,2507880," this is the result after that i increment i decrement the amount of arguments and i increment"
2507880,2513240," with the pointer and then i can return the results right so that's the idea essentially"
2513240,2522920," uh and that thing will help us to easily parse the uh command line arguments right so the first thing"
2522920,2533720," we're gonna do uh we're gonna skip the uh program name skip program name uh why not share star star"
2533720,2542840," because i'm programming in prc it doesn't have uh references it doesn't have references uh if rgc so"
2542840,2549320," if after the separation the amount of arguments is uh equal zero maybe we can do something like"
2549320,2554760," so recalls in zero because it's an integer it's not unsigned int right so better be like you know"
2554760,2561160," extra cautious and stuff uh we can throw some sort of an error right saying that"
2561160,2574200," programmer you did the fucky wacky um so error expected expected file path right and we can also print at the"
2574200,2586920," usage uh usage uh usage png to see uh input uh file path png like this and all of that has to be a new line"
2586920,2594920," and after that we have to exit with one there we go so but if that didn't fail we have a file path and"
2594920,2604920," we're gonna do shift rgc there we go cool i think the boat is dead but uh"
2604920,2608760," wait a second"
2617080,2618440," show cmd project"
2618440,2629720," ah i see basically both removed these dots because dots are used as a command symbols and we have a"
2629720,2637800," command escaping for that so essentially it removes any okay all right um okay let's actually update it"
2637800,2655880," properly uh celebrating um my boomer birthday and writing some c code there we go there we go so that"
2655880,2660680," that works that seems to be working that's exactly what we're doing we're celebrating my boomer birthday"
2660680,2666680," and writing some code without further interaction interruption let's celebrate and write some code"
2666680,2679480," not everyone um understood that reference but hopefully some people did all right so and uh what"
2679480,2684200," we're gonna do here here was important this today reference okay it's pretty good you got to hear that"
2685880,2694520," so we also need to include uh implementation is to be image implementation so how do you load an image"
2694520,2697240," right so i think it's something like a little png"
2697240,2704920," i remember how do that load"
2704920,2711960," okay load nice stbi uh load"
2713800,2721240," uh this is how you do that uh loads yeah uh so this is the data"
2721240,2729400," yeah i'm finally boomer i'm finally a boomer i'm so happy by the way that i'm a boomer"
2729400,2741240," boomer oh man okay so we're gonna have x y and n uh and also have a zero but i don't remember what's the"
2741240,2747080," last argument zero in this goddamn library it's actually a pretty good library don't get me wrong"
2747080,2755160," i really like it so uh desired channels okay so when we desire to have like four channels"
2755160,2763400," it's like fortune four channels uh after that i think since i said that i want to want four channels i'll"
2763400,2771880," have a point of view uh and to have that i'll have to include std int dot h"
2771880,2779960," oh no you are the hacker known as fortune yeah the famous hacker"
2785080,2796600," all right all right uh so i suppose if if it fails it will return null uh so let's check if data equal"
2796600,2808760," null we'll have to them at printf std error uh could not allow the file uh like this all right and uh we're"
2808760,2816360," going to put the file path here and exit with one there we go so after we loaded everything up i think"
2816360,2823800," the time has come to uh generate some code to generate some code we'll have to iterate through all"
2823800,2831640," all of these u in 32s uh and uh yeah print an array so how we're going to print an array so it's going"
2831640,2840200," to be u int 32 t um and we're going to have some array name i suppose it's going to be some sort of array"
2840200,2851960," name um so let's put it like that we don't know what it is so const char um const array name and it's"
2851960,2859000," going to be png let's call png and this is how it's going to be uh i'm going to code everyone's going to"
2859000,2867480," code don't worry about it all right so and this is where we start generating code uh so after that we are"
2867480,2877160," iterating through all these things uh zero less x multiplied by y uh any critters in the chat yes"
2877160,2889000," uh 30 years old cooters only so and uh what we're doing we just do print f uh zero um i think it's just"
2889000,2903000," like x yeah you just print in x and you're providing the data i all right so and uh i think we also have"
2903000,2914440," to put like uh this thing here and uh yep there we go and that should be it so this is pretty much everything"
2914440,2921880," we need here uh i wish the array name was derived from the file name but that will require actually"
2921880,2927160," parsing this file name and i don't really want to go into that unfortunately we also can generate"
2927160,2933080," inclusion guards uh just in case but maybe i'm not going to do that let's actually just you know"
2933080,2938440," try to compile that and see if it works so it should be as simple as that so that thing just loads a"
2938440,2948120," png file uh loads a png file uh loads a png file and generates a c code out of that so uh fit code"
2948120,2959240," yeah so png2c png2c uh dot c there we go so we have to do cc uh then we're gonna have a c flags"
2960120,2969560," uh and that's essentially what we are generating that's essentially what we're generating and this"
2969560,2974280," is going to be the input and this is going to be the flags the lips but i'm not quite sure"
2974280,2981720," because deeps also include like everything we don't need everything um let's call something like common c flags"
2984440,2991160," uh so i want to have this same here and this one is going to be common c flags i'm going to have any"
2991160,2993320," leaves common c flags"
2993320,2996280," likes"
2996280,3008440," hello hello everyone thank you cozy white bear thank you thank you thank you uh so yeah"
3010360,3017640," cool and uh i think i'm going to just try to compile all of that i'm going to just try to compile all of"
3017640,3023320," that i need to try to compile png to see and it doesn't compile would you look at that nice i forgot"
3023320,3033800," the semicolon classic i'm doing that for almost 15 years i think and i still miss that uh still is that"
3033800,3042840," cost vengardium livius why why do i have to do that excuse me all right so initialization aka"
3042840,3047960," from incompatible type oh okay so we'll have to cast it we'll have to cast it"
3047960,3058600," um i can only cast types yeah i can cast types if you want so comparison of vintage expression uh science um"
3060040,3063720," all right can you just come uh turn that into size t"
3063720,3074840," and cool so that also means that we need uh minus lm maybe we can extract that to common uh libs as"
3074840,3078840," well so does anybody know what exactly we're doing right now because i feel like maybe people don't"
3078840,3085560," know uh maybe some people miss the context uh crazy buttoner one two three thank you thank you so much for"
3085560,3091480," the happy birthday uh i could look knows because uh he was watching since the beginning but so we have a"
3091480,3099000," pretty interesting um piece of software that i use almost every day it's called soon right it's a timer"
3099000,3103880," uh that shows usually you have to like provide like 10 minutes here and"
3107240,3113880," it says 10 seconds but if i do minus p something got broken here and i'm not sure what exactly but"
3113880,3121960," anyway essentially yeah i don't know i didn't really touch anything there but it's already broken but"
3121960,3130840," whatever um so yeah it's this timer and unfortunately it depends on the file digits dot png"
3131480,3138600," that file so if you try to call this thing outside uh of the folder where the file is located it will"
3138600,3144760," fail with could not load that file as png so which makes it not really like relocatable so what i'm"
3144760,3151480," trying to do right now i'm trying to bake that png image into that executable so you can run it everywhere"
3151480,3157560," so i'm doing that as just whatever just to celebrate my birthday yes i have a very pathetic life so i know"
3157560,3168120," so um add soon to path yes i will i will actually copy paste after that uh soon to user local pin"
3168120,3174600," basically where i also keep boomer uh right i have a boomer it's located there and once the one is going to be"
3174600,3183160," self-contained self-contained um we'll be able to uh put it to the path as well baking png cake"
3183160,3191560," yes that's exactly what i'm doing i'm baking the png cake uh best cake of all time best cake"
3191560,3197320," will we be doing advent of god 2020 i'm actually thinking about it i'm actually thinking about it"
3198440,3208920," uh xxd digits but here's the thing uh doing that will also include png metadata"
3208920,3218440," into the into the array so that means i will still have to parse png but here's the thing we're not"
3218440,3225640," necessarily have to parse png why not just pre-parse it at build step and bake already parsed png"
3228200,3234920," so the executable will turn out uh bigger because png also compresses the data but then you can get"
3234920,3240680," rid of the uh runtime dependencies and stuff like that uh yes today is my birthday and both i fi i'm"
3240680,3249000," finally became i finally became 30 years old cuder yes the time has come i am finally 30 years old cuder"
3249000,3252920," i'm very old i'm very tired that's old man thinking"
3256600,3264280," but at least 40 years old people say that i'm young so that's something that's something"
3264280,3273640," i'm 20 in a month and a week zoomer anyway so yeah"
3278280,3292120," updated to 14. all right so hello neutrix life hello hello lars greatness is 43 yeah i see it i was"
3292120,3298840," actually quite surprised how many like over like 30 people we have in the chat like i thought that like"
3298840,3304600," i legit surrounded by students but apparently no so there's a lot of like older people here which is"
3304600,3312120," quite cool and another 32 i see that's that's pretty cool finally 30 years old club boomers club"
3312120,3318040," um old bug actually oh yes i'm in a yellow t-shirt um"
3320760,3328520," oh another 45 and another 31 nice that's pretty cool oh lexical scope"
3328520,3335640," thank you thank you so much for 20 dollars and welcome to our 30 years old club"
3335640,3341400," why do my pinks do you not get highlighted i don't know to be fair uh"
3343400,3347800," oh maybe i actually ignored your highlights yeah yeah i think i ignored your highlights let me actually"
3347800,3351000," bring them back now they're gonna be highlighted"
3351000,3357880," um ignored imagine being ignored in 2020"
3357880,3367720," uh all right so it should work now but since it's my birthday you're not ignored anymore how about that"
3369480,3376600," uh remember when i had i can give you vip back if you want to there we go so here's your vip uh all"
3376600,3384200," right so now not now but a little bit later we have a program that converts png to c"
3384200,3393000," we implemented it so uh if we try to run it it says you didn't provide the file but if i try to provide the"
3393000,3402200," file it will shed out this thing to the standard output so and what we're supposed to do is to"
3402200,3410280," redirect to a header file like that and then if you open that header file uh i didn't open the header"
3410280,3417160," file unfortunately so it should oh it's a single line and okay so vim is actually dying trying to open"
3417160,3424920," that but this is basically what it is right so it created you this array that you can then use uh"
3424920,3430360," to create the texture for example right you can then use it to create the texture"
3430360,3439880," so and uh what's the size of that file actually it's actually quite big uh it's 3.8 megabytes"
3440440,3447480," but i mean it's the source code when you um oh yeah prefix thank you thank you so much cost okay yeah"
3447480,3453400," i forgot about prefix prefix is quite important so forget about that um"
3453400,3461560," wait where is something i think we're gonna do something uh after i'm done celebrating my uh boomer"
3461560,3469320," birthday semicolon yeah semicolon also is very important uh are you going to did buy a birthday cake or"
3469320,3480040," anything special i don't eat sugar so probably no uh i didn't buy anything special um why not use d"
3480040,3486920," ah we could use d but hex is cooler how can you call yourself an epic hacker if you use"
3486920,3495480," fucking pleb decimal come on this is too normal we have to use hexadecimal um"
3498200,3504360," seriously like why the would you do that like god damn it no specialty what do you mean by specialty"
3504360,3511480," specialty i have a loon here long i don't know how to pronounce it correctly and that's"
3511480,3520280," the only t i have here is it special enough you long max t no i don't really want t right now so"
3523320,3532360," long long t special long t uh for for corona treatment so okay uh"
3532360,3540520," i think that's it so we also i want to have like inclusion guards and"
3540520,3540760," shit"
3540760,3547320," is it yeah yeah it's a loon in russian but in in english they call it"
3547320,3553240," long but i think like pronouns it's pretty much really close to one yeah"
3553240,3560360," so let's include that so it's going to be print f"
3560360,3570760," uh if not defined png dot h or something it will depend on the file all right it will depend on the file"
3574760,3586680," um so and this has to be a new line so we'll have to define this thing uh and then we'll have to end"
3586680,3592120," the definition somewhere here uh and if like this"
3592120,3604920," so let's see let's see too many arguments for the format uh yep yep yep yep yep okay"
3606520,3614680," so let's include the process of generation into the build step uh so essentially we're going to be"
3614680,3622040," generating digits dot h and generating digit dot h depends on png to to c right and how do you generate"
3622040,3630520," it you do png to c on digits dot png which means that uh digits dot h also depends on digits dot png and"
3630520,3636440," you redirect the output to digits dot h so this is basically another build step and then we're going"
3636440,3644520," to say that soon depends on the digits dot h so what that will do uh it will try to build subun"
3644520,3650280," it will see that soon depends on digits dot h then it will see that digits dot h depend on png to c"
3650280,3656440," and then it will build a png to c and build this thing and so on and so forth so it resolves the dependencies"
3656440,3662280," as make usually does right so it builds the dependency graph and uh does the topological"
3662280,3668360," certain them and results everything thank you jatka thank you thank you thank you um thanks for"
3668360,3674440," celebrating that you're welcome if you're breaking multiple images they they if def will collide yeah it"
3674440,3680120," will uh so but that's not the concern right now uh so let's actually acknowledge that problem"
3681480,3693640," uh okay so let's do something like that uh inclusion guards and uh array and the array name are not"
3693640,3698280," customizable so this is going to be a separate issue um"
3698280,3709000," you just made a hot chocolate nice nice nice nice nice all right and now we'll have to straight up use this"
3709000,3718440," thing i suppose so we do stpi load right we load the pixels and i think now we don't even need to load"
3718440,3728760," them yeah uh another argument should be pretty easy uh yeah feel free to implement it uh so uh let's"
3728760,3735480," do the following thing we can remove stb image and instead of this thing we're going to include uh digits dot"
3735480,3743960," h the one that we just generated should be a new line every end bytes we can do that but it's not the"
3743960,3751400," priority priority right now so now uh load png file as surface"
3751400,3760840," aha this still includes quite a bit of steps to be fair that still includes quite a bit of steps and i think"
3761800,3767640," oh here's another interesting thing we don't know width and height of that thing we really don't know"
3767640,3773400," width and height of it so that means when we are generating the c file we also have to generate width"
3773400,3779480," and height hello like your life wall welcome welcome welcome to the stream so it's going to be something"
3779480,3791320," like size t width uh yep so it's going to be x uh it's going to be x this is going to be a height this is"
3791320,3802680," going to be y still pooped itself yes i know this is my like a go-to uh error handling in sdl so this is"
3802680,3810520," basically what we're going to have here uh so we have sizes we have the bytes and everything is nice cool"
3810520,3819480," um so here's the image bits and essentially i don't need to do that anymore i can just use"
3819480,3829000," png width directly like this this is another png width so in image pixels is going to be just png so that"
3829000,3835080," means in this function we don't need this parameter anymore and in this function i don't think we need"
3835080,3843640," this parameter either image file name yeah there we go and i think that's pretty much it that's the whole"
3843640,3849160," implementation and let's try to compile the whole thing and see if it works"
3853160,3858280," okay it didn't work first try uh because it still tries to uh do this thing"
3858280,3863240," it still tries to do this thing"
3863240,3878040," why does that pr have 90 commits comments oh the one i mean creating pr to torval slash linux on github"
3878040,3883960," is basically a meme at this point like nobody is doing that unironically i think it's just literally"
3883960,3884600," memeing around"
3884600,3891080," because the point is is that they don't accept any changes through github"
3891080,3895320," and there is no way to disable for requests on github so everyone's just me"
3900120,3906520," so it's it's like a meme place for everyone uh okay so there we go here's the whole build process"
3906520,3913320," right so first step we build png to see then we uh generating digits dot h and then we're compiling"
3913320,3920280," the main application and the main application is compiled so the moment of truth so the size of this"
3920280,3928120," executable is 3.7 would you look at that it's 3.7 so and if i try to run it it still works and you know"
3928120,3934280," what's interesting if i try to run it from a different place it still works it works from any"
3934280,3942120," place and that means the image is now baked into executable we successfully baked the image into the"
3942120,3949560," executable how about that uh so that means i can finally do the following thing i can uh just take this"
3949560,3953400," entire thing and copy it to use your local bin right like this"
3953400,3965160," and then i can just out of nowhere just do soon and it will just work how about that i think it's"
3965160,3971480," very cool so uh before i couldn't do that because it had a runtime dependency it always required that"
3971480,3977320," digit dot png there but now it doesn't and what's cool is that you can still modify that digits dot png because"
3977320,3984440," it's a build time dependency so we are generating c code and baking it at build time so you can modify"
3984440,3989720," this file and then rebuild the whole thing and it will bake it and everything like that so and that"
3989720,3997880," didn't take that much time and it was like pretty much first time so yeah sim links i mean it's just"
3997880,4003240," easier to not have any sim links like how about an executable that just works"
4003240,4010680," without sim linking or anything like that you know it's it's nice when things just work"
4010680,4015000," isn't it i think it's nice i don't know i know about you guys but i like that"
4019000,4032280," um it's pretty fat i mean come on it's 2020 memory is dirt cheap memory is dirty um all right so"
4032280,4040120," imagine having working code yes i know oh all right so apparently i am on the wrong branch"
4040120,4047000," uh so let me actually switch to a different branch to to the master uh memory is not cheap"
4047000,4054200," well for like i mean it depends i guess but generally it's way cheaper than it was before"
4054920,4060600," like imagine do you know the the price of a like a drum disc in 70s or something"
4060600,4071320," uh so and let's do origin origin master and so that means here i will be able to remove that"
4071320,4076760," oh actually we have some changes okay we don't have any changes to the master to the main"
4076760,4083480," uh so that means i will be able to just unstash that okay so we'll have to git ignore"
4083480,4089080," this executable so now we're generating this executable so uh it's going to be git ignore"
4089080,4098040," uh and it's going to be png2c and another thing we need to ignore we need to ignore digits.h"
4098040,4105320," because it's it's a compile time dependency so it's going to be digits.h there we go um dot exe"
4105320,4112680," because i think columbetka managed to build it on windows so that's why dot exe is there so this"
4112680,4118360," thing by the way works on windows how about that it straight up works on windows"
4118360,4123000," and that's why we have dot exe there"
4123000,4137640," ignore uh d sim slash so i i don't know what that is but i suppose it's some mac os thing right so i'm not"
4137640,4145960," sure or you're just memeing um all right so let's try to rebuild that one more time"
4145960,4156360," it is some mac os thing surprisingly mac os generates a lot of garbage that gets into zip files and stuff"
4156360,4163880," like that like why what the hell is going on there um pretty sure i accidentally committed yeah so every"
4163880,4169880," time i get like a zip from a mac os user is just filled with ds store yeah yeah and stuff like that"
4170600,4182040," it's just what it's like is does it does it store some sort of meta information why that meta information"
4182040,4191320," couldn't be stored like in the file system it's like um swoon compiled first try on 3bsd nice i'm really"
4191320,4196760," glad to hear that that's actually super cool oh and by the way we have a freebsd build now so if i"
4196760,4208440," broke freebsd so we'll know that uh for spot light search ah okay uh our home file shares were littered"
4208440,4217000," with the store uh will you fix a timer 10 minutes probably because i think i don't need to i was"
4217000,4225640," actually using old version of uh so maybe now i just don't need to do that let's let's check it out uh"
4225640,4233160," soon 10 minutes yeah i don't have to do that i will i was literally using the old version so everything's"
4233160,4240280," okay now so one uh 10 minutes okay it still works so and i'm gonna replace whatever i have"
4241000,4252920," in the user local user local bin okay uh okay cool um so and uh let's do a committee committee"
4252920,4260680," do i have an issue for that by the way i don't remember i usually create separate issues for the"
4260680,4268120," things i plan to do and i plan to do that baking for quite some time but i don't remember if i have an"
4268120,4276440," issue for that write make install target i'm too lazy for that i wouldn't have any issues okay nice um"
4276440,4292600," bake bake digits png uh well you you can actually uh contribute make install target why not um bake"
4292600,4302760," digits png into the executable during the build here we go i'm gonna push that right into the repo and"
4302760,4309640," then we're gonna create the pull request and uh we'll see if we break any of the builds uh man page"
4309640,4316680," is also missing it's very fun well i mean that'll be actually kind of cool maybe i don't know uh feel"
4316680,4323240," free to contribute all of these things i don't know i i i won't mind to uh accept them actually so"
4323240,4325080," i don't see any problems with that"
4325080,4341080," so we're building on linux mac os windows and freebsd oh my god we're building all sorts all sorts of things"
4341080,4348600," that's amazing actually um"
4348600,4358520," okay failed something failed god damn it windows oh i know what it failed because windows doesn't use"
4358520,4366280," the make file windows has its separate thing all right all right all right all right so i i see i see"
4366280,4372680," that we have to uh fix the windows but that's the point by the way that's a good thing this is exactly"
4372680,4380600," why we have ci for windows so i don't forget to update the windows build script as well so until i"
4380600,4387800," fix this build i cannot continue so it forces me to like keep these scripts up to date that's quite important"
4387800,4391240," it's fine um anyways so"
4391240,4401000," yeah the ci did the job that's exactly the intention of ci to fail and tell me that i need to do something"
4401000,4410280," uh so let us see let us see so maybe i'm going to introduce like common uh common flags as well common"
4410280,4417720," flags so it actually calls them c plus plus flex we're using c plus plus 17 to compile c code"
4417720,4424040," which probably makes sense because as far as you know microsoft visual studio doesn't have c compiler"
4424040,4433640," uh let a user fix it nah i don't think it's that difficult of a fix so i'm gonna just fix it myself um"
4434360,4440440," okay so here are includes and the leaves uh and i wonder what lips we'll need we'll probably need shell"
4440440,4449800," 32. okay so anyway so let's do uh this thing i'm gonna execute uh cxx flags do i need includes i don't"
4449800,4458920," really need the includes and so this is how we provide the executable i suppose so that means the executable"
4458920,4468760," has to be png 2 c uh then png 2 c dot c uh then we have to link this thing i'm not sure if we have to"
4468760,4474840," use shell 32 lip but i'm gonna just provide it just in case and also subsystem has to be windows okay"
4474840,4485400," after that uh what i have to do i have to take png 2 c dot exe and uh call it on"
4485400,4491880," digits dot png and redirect all of that to digits dot h so that's essentially what we're doing so we're"
4491880,4499720," generating this digits dot h and hopefully that will fix the build we'll see we'll see um"
4499720,4508680," try to fix uh the windows build all right i'm gonna push that right into the repo"
4510440,4517320," so yeah our thing is supposed to work on four different operating system or different platforms"
4517320,4525720," i would say uh linux mac os windows and even free bsd and we have builds for all of them thanks everyone"
4525720,4532520," who contributed the builds uh i don't know i think mac os was contributed by zhiang um windows was"
4532520,4537480," contributed by kolumbetka and freebsd was definitely contributed by uh her words and plots"
4537480,4541320," i want to just use something like cmake uh bloat"
4541320,4547800," i don't know but now you don't have to use cmake"
4547800,4557240," i'm just trying to keep the build as simple as possible"
4560520,4567000," sorry it still fails god damn it where did it fail it still fails on windows okay let's take a look at"
4567000,4567400," windows"
4575000,4576120," and resolve dependency"
4576120,4585080," uh scrt common main set"
4585080,4589720," i'm not sure about that"
4589720,4601080," it's something about main but i'm not sure how to go about that so i think the main situation is usually"
4601080,4601800," resolved by"
4601800,4605560," sdl"
4605560,4608600," oh yeah it uses sdl main"
4608600,4617480," user 32 okay so i have to add user 32 is that is that correct dreams that's what i need to do"
4621000,4622120," do they understand correctly"
4622120,4628840," because i didn't know anything about windows to be fair"
4628840,4635800," uh you may want to replace windows by console i think okay"
4635800,4645480," uh let's see if it's gonna work i'm gonna trust you james yes so which should i use by the way so we"
4645480,4653160," have two options either use user32.lib or subsystem console which path should we go what do you guys"
4653160,4654440," think or both of them"
4654440,4665560," win main is in console but do we still need console so do we have to keep both or should we remove uh like"
4665560,4670280," should we revert to windows or should we use console i i don't know like again i know nothing"
4670280,4676120," about windows so it's up to you windows developers so you you should tell me win32 sorry"
4676120,4683400," what should i use i didn't understand okay so"
4689720,4699560," you can print a line yeah because i like all right i'm gonna just try like subsystem console maybe"
4699560,4704280," uh because i don't understand what you're trying to tell me james well"
4704280,4709480," you're probably trolling me because that that's not helpful uh all right so"
4711960,4714760," try to try to mean win32 not"
4714760,4724360," okay try uh to replace yeah you're definitely trolling i can see that you're trolling okay"
4724360,4738040," try to build with console subsystem instead of windows uh there were two lines with there were two lines with"
4739960,4751560," where"
4751560,4764440," i swear to god people jesus christ uh okay"
4768120,4772680," um"
4772680,4776200," we'll see"
4776200,4779080," if it fails"
4779080,4780600," everyone's banned"
4780600,4782840," yes ben"
4782840,4785720," ben is definitely in common"
4785720,4787640," ben is definitely income"
4794280,4800280," okay mac os built uh but that doesn't mean anything because we're specifically looking for windows build"
4800280,4802360," windows build"
4802360,4803720," nice"
4803720,4805400," nitrix"
4805400,4809720," oh wait a second but wait wait wait wait i'm gonna look into the actual log"
4809720,4812840," uh so build"
4814840,4815640," okay okay"
4815640,4818760," okay pinch see it all right there you go"
4818760,4824200," so your vip now how about that"
4825800,4827240," so this thing actually good"
4827240,4838920," build doesn't mean works exactly"
4841080,4841720," um"
4841720,4846280," you're so goddamn right"
4846280,4851320," you must be a software engineer"
4851320,4853240," if you know that"
4853240,4856280," so we're only waiting for free bsd by the way"
4858680,4871480," tried to test the machine but i don't have cl.xz and i'm too lazy to install"
4872040,4873080," well it is what it is"
4873080,4876520," you want to be part of the epic suvun club"
4876520,4879480," you have to be actually not lazy"
4879480,4886040," it is so goddamn slow i i don't know why how much time does it take actually it's really interesting"
4886600,4887160," 10 minutes"
4887160,4889320," it's probably like"
4889320,4893240," like building the the whole free bsd first"
4893240,4895400," oh maybe i"
4895400,4898600," what the hell is good i think"
4898600,4904760," it's okay it's starting up a virtual machine with free bsd"
4904760,4909880," oh it literally is like downloading and starting up psd machine"
4911880,4916920," well i mean well how else would you implement that on github actions i suppose like i don't know a"
4916920,4923000," better way um so i mean at least it's something at least it's something so i don't complain"
4923000,4935400," yeah it's certainly one way to do that that's for sure"
4940760,4944920," but eventually hopefully we'll get there so we can take a look at the previous"
4944920,4949000," uh free bsd pull request that was suggested by hurts and plots"
4949000,4952360," just to see how much time it usually takes"
4952360,4957960," maria's project takes five minutes to build on both windows and linux on ci"
4957960,4962360," well this is not rust okay and this is not your machine"
4962360,4965160," got him"
4970280,4975240," uh so where are the this thing okay"
4975240,4977560," rust"
4977560,4983320," and seven"
4983320,4985400," fucking minutes"
4985400,4992040," i guess it's okay it's not an hour or anything like i mean"
4992040,4996120," just casually check whether it builds on freebsd"
4998840,5005640," we can wait i think we can wait so yeah but the most important thing is that we managed to do it"
5005640,5011560," we managed to do it we managed to bake digits png into the executable and now the executable is"
5011560,5017800," completely independent and can be copied anywhere it can be run from anywhere and it's absolutely"
5017800,5023400," beautiful and i'm finally happy this is the best birthday gift gift i've ever made myself"
5024280,5031480," yes this is literally my 30 years old uh birthday gift every time for come now a baker exactly"
5032360,5039320," um it's spinning up the virtual machine to test the newest complaint yes um"
5039320,5047160," all right uh so i guess we're not gonna wait until then and we're gonna just move on"
5047160,5053560," so according to the schedule today uh we're supposed to be programming something right we're supposed to be"
5053560,5064120," programming something and something uh yes i'm from 90s yes from 1990 that is completely correct"
5064120,5071880," am i a boomer am i a millennial i don't know i think millennials are like starting from 80s"
5073080,5082760," yeah yeah yeah october nice uh success did it build uh remind okay so let's take a look at if it builds"
5082760,5091800," bake you just png oh the first one built but the push didn't build it only started okay so it started"
5091800,5097960," it started them sequentially i think i'm i'm i'm a zoomer right uh i'm from z uh zgen let's see"
5097960,5110520," um okay so that means it's peeled but it didn't report properly yet so okay beautiful finally the uh"
5112040,5115560," we can merge with this chip confirm merge"
5115560,5123240," epic and all of that compiles on all of the four platforms that we support nice nice nice nice nice"
5123240,5134120," cool and by the way if anyone wants to get this epic uh like a countdown uh you can get it uh by this link"
5134120,5143160," if you want to uh on github actions mac os build has 10 x minute uh multiplier huh"
5143160,5149160," well i mean it wasn't really that slow i'm not sure what you're talking about but anyway"
5149160,5157400," uh four minutes is actually fast my pr is at work take uh almost an hour to pass yeah i mean classic"
5157960,5165320," well at least you it's not a nightly build right because at some places people uh run the full beat"
5165320,5171080," build overnight and usually i worked in an environment where i could only check my"
5171080,5177560," changes on the next day after the nightly build that was fun i think i already told that story yeah so"
5177560,5186600," these builds that i have you know right now are completely insane compared to what i had in"
5186600,5193320," in the uh at the work let's talk about github action costs 10 minutes ah cost i i forgot i forgot it's"
5193320,5195960," it's a cost yeah they cost like minutes or something"
5195960,5209400," would you accept the power which depends on the z compiler not sure"
5209400,5215480," i'm not sure if i will because that means i will have to install z compiler and i don't want to"
5216200,5226360," so yeah i don't think so um all right so let me see let me see"
5226360,5232440," okay"
5232440,5245960," so uh yeah so according to the schedule we are supposed to develop uh something which is the game that we've"
5245960,5252440," been developing for quite some time um you can find here right you can find it here um"
5252440,5262360," and uh let's check it out um so you can get the recap of this project here here's even a source code"
5262360,5270600," it's the game uh all right so i think i need to go to the master and fetch the latest changes and stuff"
5275160,5280600," so we're gonna"
5280600,5284200," so we're gonna take a look at the latest version of something"
5284200,5288520," do you use unity or unreal i use both of them simultaneously"
5288520,5296600," uh okay so and let's try to build everything let's try to build everything"
5299800,5304600," thank you good christian thank you thank you two engines there yet"
5304600,5308360," unity and unreality"
5308360,5317160," all right so i think it's almost done and uh let's go"
5317160,5319960," uh let's take a look at this thing"
5319960,5327560," cool so this is how the game looks like you can do pew pew pew oh we don't we don't have pew pew pew but we have"
5327560,5331000," different kinds of projectiles and now they even have different sounds"
5331000,5339880," uh and we can even have uh enemies and stuff like that that uh shoot different projectiles"
5343320,5347320," but yeah i won't be able i won't be able to kill them because uh"
5347320,5352600," the water projectiles actually destroy the fire projectiles so it's not really possible"
5352600,5357960," or easy to do it like that so this is the game that we've been developing for quite some time and"
5357960,5360920," today i suppose we're going to continue developing it and we'll see how it goes"
5361960,5367560," we'll see how it goes did you have loot boxes that's a very funny and original question thank you for"
5367560,5378120," asking it so let's take a look at something um and uh let's take a look at what we need to do here"
5379400,5388440," um do we have any plan do we have any plan for today uh release data pack building uh it's kind of"
5388440,5395560," boring uh animate parser can we have something like game uh design related that would be interesting"
5397160,5405000," so sound blocks and uh don't drop any items anymore we can work on that that sounds very interesting"
5406600,5413240," that's sounds interesting oh by the way this is actually not up to date uh cmd project"
5413240,5422600," celebrating my boomer brother and writing some c c plus plus code um source code is available"
5422600,5428840," here github.com zozing something right"
5432600,5442200," okay cool uh can't compare there's no reason to play different sounds when you pick up yeah this"
5442200,5447720," could be another refactoring that we could do basically the refactoring that i wanted to have"
5447720,5456360," for quite some time um yeah so let's actually plan all of that how long have you been working with in um"
5456360,5460120," i'm quite fascinated by the originality"
5462040,5465400," uh thank you for the sarcasm uh let me see"
5465400,5473400," i'm not working on it for every day by the way i only working on it uh twice a week"
5473400,5482520," and uh saturday and sunday right saturday and sunday for like up to four hours so i'm working on it like"
5482520,5491960," up to eight hours a week so it's basically one day a week uh and i'm working on it starting from february"
5491960,5495400," november 9th of 2000 and 2020."
5495400,5503400," does it make sense is that a good progress is that a bad progress i don't know because i have other"
5503400,5510200," projects i'm working on several projects in parallel so yeah does it answer your question i don't know"
5511720,5516760," uh okay so let's actually add that to the project and we'll see we'll see we'll see"
5518920,5530440," uh it's good pokers i don't know i don't know i don't know we'll see we'll see we'll see all right"
5534760,5541800," and let's all of that here so here's the interesting thing uh when you pick up the items"
5541800,5548200," right when you pick up the items it plays a particular sound uh so let's play something here"
5550360,5557960," yeah you probably heard that right so this thing so it plays this sound so we can use this sound for"
5557960,5567720," every item but for some reason in our agent agent engine in our engine uh we store the reference to"
5567720,5573720," the sound the item should play so we technically have um a possibility to play different sounds on"
5573720,5578280," picking up picking up different items and we don't really need that it's kind of redundant i don't"
5578280,5583960," plan to have different items different sounds for different items so i was just wanting to go through"
5583960,5591160," the code and remove that thing luckily it should be as easy as just removing that and uh going through"
5591160,5597960," the places where we use that and refactoring it properly stuff like that so yeah could be a pretty"
5597960,5609720," cool warm-up uh issue it's only a second game i don't know my first game i never finished and i"
5609720,5614040," developed like small games throughout my life anyway it was like very small games"
5614040,5617320," so"
5620040,5627000," okay let's create a separate branch for this refactoring right 266"
5627000,5637480," uh and uh let's go something crashes when trying to launch on systems without audio support"
5637480,5643320," it reminds me of something didn't we have a similar"
5644200,5653480," thing with nothing and you were fixing that on like dragonfly bsd or something oh okay so uh"
5653480,5660520," maybe we could create the issue for that all right thank you so um"
5665720,5674840," it's so slow it's so slow application crashes on systems without audio support thank you thank you so"
5674840,5689080," much in the both uh we had a similar situation in nothing should probably just port it port the solution"
5689080,5696440," from there we had to run it on wsl but they will say has no support for also i see i see so uh does it"
5696440,5703080," say anything does it just say like a zeal pooped itself or something um yeah probably we just have to"
5703080,5705560," to handle that somehow and not crash"
5705560,5720840," yeah the zeal pooped itself let's see yep okay thank you i'll try to address that a little bit later"
5720840,5724600," because uh i don't really have right now an environment to reproduce that so"
5724600,5732920," i'm not sure how easy it would be to reproduce uh by the way to be fair not gonna lie i kind of want"
5732920,5739720," some tea so let's actually make some tea does anybody have any questions maybe while i'm making some tea"
5739720,5749000," so or anything to say to me um dove dude awesome ask whether i do back end uh what do you mean by"
5749000,5755080," back end you know back at com back end compilers i never actually developed uh backends for compilers"
5755080,5760360," so yeah i don't know what is the back end what do you mean by back end"
5762760,5769960," um tea party yeah back end is a very abstract thing"
5769960,5775080," um it's like asking have you ever developed libraries"
5775080,5785800," i guess like sure i think you and cost thank you thank you thank you uh how did you learn to type so"
5785800,5792600," fast i was just programming a lot i didn't do that intentionally i was just programming and it just came to me"
5793400,5802120," uh i'm using long a long team uh yeah that's that's the one i'm using so i'm gonna quickly go to my"
5802120,5809400," kitchen and turn on the kettle it's gonna be super quick and then i'm gonna go back and we'll wait until"
5809400,5815960," the water has boiled i just tried compiling something and doesn't compile for me could you please uh submit"
5815960,5824520," uh an issue with the steps you did to build it and with the output log preferably full output log with"
5824520,5836760," all of the errors there i would really appreciate that thank you very much um okay"
5836760,5852680," can someone write the name of the tea uh it's oolong as far as i know yeah yeah it's that one thank you"
5852680,5873880," thank you thank you so much uh doesn't own an iot i don't own any internet of things things uh thank"
5873880,5882280," you uh thank you uh that both chat thank you thank you thank you um yeah imagine using our iot"
5882280,5890680," um all the rights i'm a little bit hungry not gonna lie internet of things things"
5894280,5902120," yes yes i know uh uh thank you pop boy thank you thank you um i'm doing well i think thank you spark"
5902120,5906680," sparkly looks right thank you um so what we're doing"
5908920,5917160," imagine having things in your internet connected to the internet exactly cringe uh so um"
5917160,5921240," so we created that"
5921240,5935480," why paypal requires registration uh i'm sorry about that i'm so sorry about that"
5937560,5940120," this is what this uh but"
5940120,5951880," so let's go to the items so we need to remove the sound uh field from the item right that's what we"
5951880,5959320," need to do here something item uh so that's essentially going to be the whole uh refactoring"
5959320,5966920," that's going to be the whole refactoring and uh let's do make minus b and we'll see how it goes"
5967560,5978120," let's see how it goes so we're using pop sound to uh for as a sound for playing when we pick up the item"
5978120,5984600," that's a very complex sentence i don't know uh how to simplify it right so we'll have to save it just for"
5984600,5993720," the future reference uh and okay so we are removing it from all of the items where we initialize them"
5994600,6005320," um pop sounds to me yes uh isn't grim thank you happy birthday happy birthday thank you thank you"
6005320,6012920," thank you for three months of tier one subscription and welcome to our 30 years old club how about that"
6012920,6021080," the club of existential crisis love it love it so much all right so uh and this is basically where we want"
6021080,6031000," we want to play all of that we want to play the pop sound index uh yeah pop sound index i got them"
6031000,6040520," and another one is pop sound index and that should fix everything hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully"
6048520,6061160," okay good it's building it's building it's building things which is cool it's warming up my cpu it's"
6061160,6070280," warming up my room and it's finally built so and uh let's see if it works now so let's see if at least we"
6070280,6078200," didn't break anything right we can still do pew pew pew and uh if we spawn an item right when we pick them up"
6078520,6085800," still place the pop sound you can even hear it can you hear it so that means we didn't break anything"
6085800,6093960," and that means we successfully factored the code right so now it's a little bit less you know obnoxious"
6093960,6100040," uh yeah we just removed a bunch of stuff and we directly use this thing here um"
6101800,6110440," yes that's the idea that's the idea essentially uh i could took oh my god work around feels okay"
6110440,6116360," but it's a little bit more expensive but well you didn't have to but thank you thank you so much for"
6116360,6123000," 500 beats i really really appreciate that thank you thank you thank you uh a few shippoos hello hello"
6123720,6133560," um thank you so much so i think my kettle is ready by the way i'm gonna quickly brew some tea just a second"
6133560,6145400," just a second"
6163560,6171640," yeah"
6171640,6180440," yeah it is what it is thank you thank you so much all right so the tea is brewing the tea is brewing"
6180440,6188280," and let's see what else do we have to do so we'll have to commit that and make a pull request"
6189560,6201160," um remove sound field associated with uh an item with an item and we're gonna push that right into the"
6201160,6207000," repo there we go i'm gonna push that right into the repo"
6215720,6220760," okay let's create the pull request for for this thing i always create pull requests to my repo"
6220760,6224840," just to go to continuous integration it's not really necessary it's just something that i like to do"
6224840,6232120," and uh maybe while we're waiting for continuous integration maybe somebody has any questions"
6232120,6235080," thank you bill general thank you thank you thank you uh yeah"
6235080,6241800," oh you you created a okay compilation error in aids"
6243000,6248440," that's interesting okay thank you thank you so much for for submitting the pull request issue i mean"
6248440,6253880," uh releases not oh"
6253880,6267080," i think i know what it is it's arch we already had that we already had that"
6271400,6280840," thank you um thank you so much glad to see the porn folder is now yeah it's it's actually getting"
6280840,6291160," smaller unfortunately as i grow older the porn folder is getting smaller yes it is what it is i'm getting old"
6291160,6292840," yeah"
6295960,6301240," so it is actually similar and it's also on arch and it's gcc 10"
6301240,6316360," what's the gcc version 10 to it's the same gcc version oh okay i see so it's some sort of a problem"
6316360,6323240," like specifically on arch and it's not reproducible in clang for example if you try to build it with clang"
6323240,6327880," it's not going to be reproducible so uh i'm going to just mark it as a duplicate but i'm going to not"
6327880,6333880," going to close it uh duplicate of uh two three"
6333880,6342520," uh two three seven yeah it's a duplicate of two three seven uh but i'm going to keep it for for now"
6343240,6348760," uh i can try out ubuntu 10 to feel free to do so if you have time and motivation"
6348760,6355800," with the meme distro strikes again it's not really something with arch i think i think it's something"
6355800,6361720," specifically with gcc because i remember people said that they tried clang and it worked on arch"
6361720,6369400," with clang it's something with gcc gcc is getting worse and worse uh every release but maybe it's actually"
6369400,6380600," my fault i don't know i think i saw this error on gcc free psd as well okay so i don't know if it's my"
6380600,6388600," fault or maybe gcc is being gcc uh most of the arch memes revolve around gcc breaking i didn't know that"
6388600,6399640," i'm not actively using arch so yeah it's kind of funny um so do you guys want uh tsmr a little bit"
6399640,6409080," of a tsmr because i have a little bit of tsmr for you it's gcc 10 only i see"
6412680,6426120," all right tsmr has been delivered here's some tsmr for you chat"
6426120,6431880," cool"
6434680,6440120," it compiles on gcc 10 uh too interesting that's really strange"
6440120,6447080," maybe it's a problem of gcc and arch that could be it"
6447080,6456280," we'll see we'll see we'll see we'll see we'll see uh all right but in the meantime i think we are ready"
6456280,6463400," to merge this pull request and just move on and just move on uh let's delete the branch as well"
6464840,6469640," uh so the next issue that we're going to be working on is going to be something around"
6469640,6473240," i already forgot i remember that i scheduled something but i already forgot"
6473240,6484840," okay enemies don't drop any items anymore yes this is a problem because they used to drop items"
6484840,6487320," what os do i use uh"
6490280,6491720," yeah so here's the ways"
6491720,6501560," uh yeah let's take a look at that so i'm going to go to the master and we're going to try to"
6501560,6502920," reproduce this situation"
6502920,6514280," should they even drop anything we can actually make them drop uh essentially they can drop the"
6514840,6524360," weapons the amount of weapons that they have um right and let's merge the latest changes origin must emerge"
6524360,6532760," of course it works it's a boot god damn that was pretty savage yes"
6535720,6542920," uh nice i don't know why i'm building everything i should only build debug"
6548120,6557720," uh all right so essentially uh if you kill for example uh an ice golem the ice golem should drop"
6557720,6564200," an ice block right so it should block an ice block thank you maybe just james thank you thank you thank"
6564200,6570280," you uh but it doesn't so and this is something that we broke recently as we were refactoring the weapon"
6570280,6579560," system and this is something that i wanted to fix so essentially uh we can have weapons that place blocks"
6579560,6587400," right so we can place blocks like that and the idea is we can give those weapons to the entities to the enemies"
6587400,6596600," and when the entity dies we can drop all of these amounts as items right we can drop them as items"
6597240,6604200," um yeah you're planning on including power-ups like invulnerability or something not yet not yet i'm just"
6604200,6610280," adding features and see how they fit together and once i see a coherent system then i will start thinking"
6610280,6617160," whether to add more and whether to expand the system all right so yeah first we need to see how the"
6617160,6626440," features work together and then we can think of whether to add more um okay okay so uh let's go and fix"
6626440,6640440," this situation um 304 304 304 um so i'm not sure what would be the best way to do that uh so we can go to"
6640440,6649960," the enemies um actually entities and we need to go to the entity constructors um yeah so we have a golem entity"
6650680,6659000," uh and we give a golem entity a rogue gun so it can uh basically shoot with rocks right so if you have the"
6659000,6664680," golem entity here it should with rocks that look like but like potatoes but that's basically like a"
6664680,6672600," program resort uh right it's just a program resort nothing special uh and we can give it another weapon"
6673160,6681720," uh which is going to be i suppose dirt block placer right it's not going to be really available to"
6681720,6689080," the enemy right but it's going to be there in case the enemy dies all of these blocks that it had"
6689080,6694920," specifically one block will be dropped on the floor so that's going to be the idea so to each of this entity"
6694920,6699880," we're going to like give these placers and we're going to use them as what the entity is supposed to"
6699880,6708360," drop uh when it dies right so i guess we can call these weapon slots each entity by the way has a weapon"
6708360,6721080," slots uh has weapon slots wait a second entity hpp so weapon slots yeah yeah and you can place weapons"
6721080,6727480," there and we can use them as you know inventory of the uh of the entity at least for now maybe once"
6727480,6732520," it becomes more complicated we can make uh more sophisticated inventory system"
6732520,6739480," potato potato spots for you i don't understand this reference i'm sorry"
6739480,6742760," oh by the way i have tea i forgot that i have tea"
6742760,6754120," oh my god a little bit tired already i've been out today had to go outside and it's really cold outside"
6754120,6761800," that way right now in the recipe is like minus 17 and a little bit of wind and together it's actually"
6761800,6770440," not really pleasant so yeah it was a little bit difficult but i managed to go through i managed to"
6770440,6778440," go through going inside yeah imagine going outside especially in siberia in during the winter yeah"
6783880,6791400," so anyway let's uh so this is the ice going right so we can do entity push weapon"
6791400,6800760," ice block placer and we're gonna give it one block as well uh so the entities are not gonna use these"
6800760,6807240," weapons by the way because they only always use the one that is first in their inventory so they ignore"
6807240,6808920," everything after that so that should be okay"
6811400,6818920," oh thank you happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear"
6818920,6823720," insert"
6823720,6839160," what was that so yeah so yeah this is the side effects of russian tts uh so let me read that uh thank you"
6839160,6847240," insert name here thank you thank you so much uh for five dollars and thank you for such a beautiful"
6847240,6852840," song song it was absolutely beautiful especially uh when it's read by a russian tts"
6852840,6856200," uh so yeah"
6856200,6859080," anyways"
6859080,6868120," so this is a player entity and i guess that's it oh yeah it is my birthday today fish thank you thank you"
6868120,6876920," so much for wishing me happy birthday i finally became a 30 years old cooter so yeah"
6876920,6888680," i've been 29 for the whole year and then i finally decided the time has come and i turned 30."
6890440,6891640," that's how it happened actually"
6891640,6892200," that's how it happened actually yes"
6892200,6903880," it was my decision all along i just said it um what a year for a milestone birthday yeah"
6903880,6907800," uh that means you can retire probably not"
6910680,6919320," just pushed your new version yeah uh all right so um yeah so now i want to check through all of these"
6919320,6928600," things right so they just do that they don't do anything special okay and now when an entity dies"
6928600,6937080," we need to go through its weapons and drop all of the placers right drop all of the placers and i"
6937080,6944520," i wonder where do we kill the entity or something so uh yeah so it's gonna be kill"
6944520,6951240," so here we're killing projectiles okay so this is the entity projectile interaction and this is"
6951240,6958040," where we play crunch sound when it dies and this is where we have to actually drop the items uh hello"
6958040,6964040," the thinner welcome welcome welcome welcome really glad to see you hello hello hello um"
6965240,6969400," god sugar free cake no i didn't get any cake"
6969400,6974920," to be fair to be fair i didn't have any cake"
6974920,6981000," all right so"
6981000,6994360," um yes thank you thank you this is enough thank you so much uh so in the entity uh"
6995800,7003320," we'll just have to go through all the weapon slots right so size i zero uh less than"
7003320,7014920," to be fair maybe we just have to do that slightly differently maybe the entity itself should actually"
7014920,7022200," drop those items into the game right because we may call entity kill several times right we can call it"
7022200,7029160," several times um but uh that means we'll have to find all the places where we kill in the entity and add"
7029160,7035160," that code there it's better to drop items inside of the entity kill i think i think that will be way"
7035160,7041400," better but that will require actually passing the game right it will require passing the game because uh"
7041400,7048760," you can only spawn an item when you have an instance of the game so uh let's go to the entity uh let's go to the"
7048760,7056600," entity uh drops manager i don't know i don't really have any managers and to be fair i don't like"
7056600,7064120," calling classes or structures managers uh because they're quite confusing for me because you you can"
7064120,7069560," look at the manager and you can never know what exactly it's doing so essentially if you have a"
7069560,7076040," class manager it's doing pretty much everything usually the name does not like limit the scope of"
7076040,7085080," the entity or class so i try to like i prefer um calling things very specifically right uh for example"
7085080,7091080," i have entity well it's it's a very abstract name but by entity we mean something like player or enemy or"
7091080,7099240," anything like that or i like to call things like an item projectile like specific things or if it's a"
7099240,7107640," like god object in here is going to be a game right so i don't have like i think no i don't have any"
7107640,7113560," managers but i have the game and this is the game the state of the whole game it's managing duh yeah exactly"
7114760,7121640," um okay so where is the kill uh methods and it's not how we spell kill i think all right this thing"
7121640,7131400," should accept a pointer to the game should accept pointer to the game and let's go to the entity cpp"
7131400,7139080," and when i kill this entire thing okay so here's the game uh right and this is where we have to start"
7139080,7148360," dropping things so i'm gonna start iterating uh through this entire thing uh weapon slots count this is"
7148360,7161080," what i'm doing here weapon slots counts uh count and um yeah if weapon i uh and i think we need to check"
7161080,7165960," the type of the type of the weapon we have different types of the weapons by the way uh different types"
7165960,7178200," of the weapons uh so type yeah if type of the weapon equal to weapon type weapon type and what's that"
7181480,7188040," place or yes it's a place or yes it's a place or we'll have to spawn some items we'll have to spawn some"
7188040,7202680," items uh and what's interesting is that we don't know what items to spawn i kill you by placement yeah"
7202680,7210520," we don't know what items to spawn based purely on the weapon because weapon doesn't store the associated"
7210520,7217800," items it stores the projectiles yeah place or stores it doesn't even store projectile it just"
7217800,7225240," stores the tile that it's supposed to place but item is a completely different thing god damn so using"
7225240,7236920," weapons as the uh you know quick hack item system is not really gonna work uh you are 30 i mean i'm actually"
7236920,7243800," exactly 30 right now so today is my birthday yeah um"
7243800,7253560," placer the forgotten american gladiator i do not understand that uh reference i'm sorry happy birthday"
7253560,7259480," thank you thank you so much john pun thunk thank you thank you thank you all right so maybe that means"
7259480,7264120," this idea is not really gonna work you look younger than 30 really"
7264120,7274680," i don't know oh you you look 40 oh okay and 40 is younger than 30 i see i see i see"
7279320,7287240," this this drum sound i thought i opened my favorite video website again yes uh you know you know exactly"
7287240,7298680," what uh what i'm listening to um uh it's a show where the athletes had stupid in in which country by the"
7298680,7305080," way uh uh i i don't remember this thing um are you interested in a stupid joke that's totally not worth"
7305080,7308840," posting sure go ahead it's it's my birthday so yeah why not"
7311640,7318520," so but i'm gonna open it on the second screen just in case it's something to us and friendly so i'm sorry um"
7318520,7322760," all right so"
7328680,7332120," oh well"
7332120,7332360," cool"
7332360,7344360," god damn it well i'm 30 years old here okay i'm supposed to make dad's jokes today aren't i"
7344360,7350120," don't i i don't speak english anyway so we're um"
7353240,7360840," do you use openglo vulcan i do not depend on neither of them i use only sdl do you have a kit no i don't"
7360840,7365560," if not you're fine to make dad jokes oh i see"
7365560,7373960," okay okay okay"
7379640,7386680," dad jokes are a natural reaction of a 30 years old man to a child right they see a child they have"
7386680,7392760," an urge to make a dad jokes so if i don't have any kids i i'm fine to not make any dad jokes if i"
7392760,7399080," understood correctly anyways so i think we need to introduce the uh inventory system of some sort"
7399080,7400920," at least the invisible one"
7400920,7409400," does sdl batch draws i think it does because it actually quite fast and i would assume that"
7409400,7416120," the way they achieve that is by actually storing first what you want to draw in a renderer and when"
7416120,7422840," you swap and present your scene the only then the batch draw the exact the whole thing because it works"
7422840,7429000," quite fast so i think it's it's a batch drone your humor gets so dark you have to have dead jokes"
7429000,7435160," options so you don't corrupt child ah okay that makes sense actually what color is them is this uh it's a"
7435160,7444200," group bird darker i'm gonna make a three psd package so feel free to do so so it should be pretty easy"
7444200,7444600," right now"
7444600,7450120," it's a scam it's slow don't tell me otherwise sure"
7452840,7459720," whatever i won't tell you anything then um"
7459720,7466920," um what i was doing actually i want to introduce inventory system because this thing doesn't really"
7466920,7478120," work right uh doesn't really work out right that's what i wanted to say just like myself uh so item"
7479560,7487720," uh let's actually call them items to drop after death"
7487720,7495720," on what resources did you learn english so well uh if it weren't for the lousy russian i wouldn't recognize"
7495720,7503400," you uh well life taught me english"
7503400,7512440," to be fair i was just you know browsing the internet trying to get the most interesting content on the"
7512440,7518120," internet on the internet and the most interesting content is of course in english and that slowly made"
7518120,7526680," me learn that language plus i worked a lot in outsource right and in an outsource if you don't"
7526680,7535160," speak english well you're out instantly so and that like you know stressful competitive environment"
7535160,7540440," actually made me learn english on relatively decent level i don't know"
7541240,7547080," also after outsource i was working in the freelance which is pretty much the same thing but harder so"
7547080,7553560," yeah what the fuck is outsource it's when like a big american corporation"
7553560,7559400," doesn't want to develop the project themselves because they have neither resources nor money"
7559400,7564120," usually they just don't have time for that so they don't want to waste the time of their developers"
7564120,7572360," so they actually give that to a company in like uh in a third world country like russia for example so"
7572360,7574280," yeah that's how it works"
7574280,7582920," uh you speak better english than some native speakers i don't think so uh i don't know maybe"
7585800,7594200," are you russian yes i am i'm from maza russia thank you thank you much mutually asserted action thank you"
7594200,7600120," uh all right so i'm gonna go full john blow on that and i'm gonna call this uh"
7600120,7603880," field items to drop after death that's exactly how i'm gonna call that"
7614920,7616920," russia is two and a half world yeah pretty much"
7616920,7624040," to be fair some of the places in my city do look like a third world country not gonna lie"
7624040,7630920," um okay so"
7630920,7641800," items to drop after death capacity killrog subscribed at tier one thank you thank you so much for subscribing"
7641800,7648040," your first subscription by the way and welcome to a 30 years old club you're 30 years old now"
7648040,7652360," and you have a middle age crisis boom you're welcome"
7652360,7659160," anyway somebody does look like third world world two i can imagine that"
7659160,7662600," probably what was your favorite job that you had done"
7665400,7671000," this one i guess so far uh it's it's the best job i've ever had"
7671000,7678280," it's not gonna lie uh how about you devote one day per week in competitive programming and solve hard"
7678280,7685160," algorithmic problems i already tried that that made me depressive uh 30 years old millennial boomer club"
7685160,7687000," yes exactly um"
7687000,7696680," okay so uh items to drop after death and uh then we're gonna have something like"
7696680,7702280," items to drop after death count right so that's pretty much it"
7703800,7712200," um has boomer changed meaning to be an age uh range instead of generation real question i'm out of the"
7712200,7719800," loop the word boomer basically became a meme i think it became a meme after you know this idea of"
7719800,7726520," 30 years old boomer and 30 years old boomer come from the fact that there is like a new generation of"
7726520,7734600," people who are relatively young like 30 years old but still quite illiterate illiterate when it comes"
7734600,7739800," to computers and stuff which is quite fascinating because they grew up with computers so they should"
7739800,7744920," know how computers works how to do some stuff but still they act like boomers who don't know anything"
7744920,7751720," about computers and i think this is where the uh the meme of 30 years old boomer came from but i'm not"
7751720,7758440," quite sure so don't quote me on that and also please correct me and i think from there this meme mutated"
7758440,7766760," so now people use boomer to pretty much anything it just doesn't mean anything anymore um have you ever"
7766760,7773960," considered a move to us i actually have uh i also considered moving to europe but i'm not sure how to"
7773960,7779880," pull that off or whether i will be able to do that so i don't know i also don't really have that much"
7779880,7788920," motivation motivation to do anything so we'll see we'll put on latch relief and why not we don't have"
7788920,7794120," an iron curtain right now luckily yet i don't know what's going to happen in the future but we'll see"
7794120,7800760," also from the fact that new agencies give birth day ranges that completely didn't match up"
7800760,7802200," interesting"
7804440,7809640," so a lot of a lot of people especially very talented people move out of russia relatively easily"
7809640,7815640," they just get invited into like european or american companies so and our government doesn't"
7815640,7819720," really stop them again we don't have an iron curtain like in soviet times or anything"
7824680,7828120," russia today is not soviet russia like it's a completely different country"
7828120,7837000," almost i'm moving to czech republic by you blue card uh being in android software dev it's kind of easy"
7837000,7842280," for inexperienced boomers i'll consider that thank you okay bro thank you"
7845480,7850520," 30 years old boomer literally has a no meme page i see oh that means it's a normie now"
7850520,7860760," so maybe i can also become an epic android software dev"
7860760,7869160," uh android development is actually quite easy it's kind of annoying to be fair it's it's not hard but"
7869160,7879160," it's annoying considering the android apis and stuff uh so you know kotlin already yeah oh by the way how"
7879160,7885000," often people use kotlin for uh mobile development i don't really know because kotlin seems pretty easy"
7885000,7890680," to learn like i learned it in one session so uh having like previous experience and stuff"
7890680,7898120," i don't understand why android uh decided to add java on top of linux this is actually easy"
7898120,7903000," uh easy to answer it's a it's a very simple question question essentially when the android"
7903000,7908280," was created there was a huge hype around java the same hype there is around the javascript"
7908280,7914760," so there was a lot of java developers there is still a lot of java developers so by using java"
7914760,7921160," as their main language for this development platform they had a huge pool of already available developers"
7921160,7927240," who don't have to learn anything and that boosted their platform like quite quite a bit"
7928280,7933400," so for example apple doesn't have that pool of developers there's way less uh you know objective"
7933400,7940120," there were way less objective c developers than there were java developers so that's actually quite an"
7940120,7946280," easy answer yeah because java was popular and if you use java as a main language you have the pool of"
7946280,7953000," developers i believe android also has html.js front-end for apps too yeah by the way i think if android was"
7953000,7961560," created today instead of java they would have been using javascript um and didn't want to do"
7961560,7967480," something on the unreal engine i don't find using engines interesting because i don't learn anything"
7967480,7971800," this is primarily like a learning project i want to learn things and that's why i don't use any engines"
7971800,7982920," um we need these devices to have a good battery life let's use java i think like battery life at the"
7982920,7987800," time when the decision was made was not really that much of a priority the priority was to get into the"
7987800,7992200," market as quickly as possible and using java actually provided that opportunity and that's the"
7992200,8000040," reason why google still fights with oracle uh about that right because oracle understand that that's"
8000040,8006040," exactly what gave them advantage and they want uh their piece of uh piece of cake from that but again"
8006040,8013400," i didn't look into the oracle versus google situation so not going to comment on that i think casey like did"
8013400,8020040," like series of videos where he like dive deep into this case and that was quite interesting but i myself"
8020040,8025880," not going to comment on that and oracle sucks yes it's absolutely a horrible uh company um"
8025880,8033720," people underestimate how insane huge yeah exactly it's insanely huge it's just people who use java"
8033720,8039160," they don't sit on hacker news that's why you don't see them they're just like a regular five to nine men"
8039160,8046280," like with the family and stuff like that but there's a lot of them jesus christ there's a lot of them"
8049000,8058280," uh the video i saw from casey on the case studies seems like pretty pretty much to be it it kind of"
8058280,8063480," was if you're not into like a lost law stuff it's it's kind of it's kind of easy yeah no good life"
8063480,8071880," um all right on top of these items do we wanna yeah i think we also want to associate like the amount of"
8071880,8078600," items that we want to drop there that would be actually pretty cool so items to drop after death"
8078600,8085880," it would be cool to have some sort of a player like that like this and uh sort of like size t but"
8085880,8091160," we don't really don't really have payers so uh maybe i'm gonna introduce my own players question max"
8091160,8091720," question mark"
8091720,8107640," with all uh in js it's worst nightmare i can imagine so far well it's gonna look like uh"
8109160,8115480," web development i suppose that's how i was gonna look like new aids release yeah maybe we can do a"
8115480,8122680," new aids release so it would be cool to have tuples in aids but i think like usually you just need like a"
8122680,8128360," a quick pair right and if you if you need more than two elements you can always create a new structure"
8128360,8136040," right uh we can always do the following thing uh i can introduce item slot um i think initial second"
8136040,8142120," thank you thank you thank you uh item slot right so this is what we're gonna have here item slot which"
8142120,8145880," contains an item and uh count"
8149240,8156840," boom your app is now microservice exactly so now we have slots right so instead of this thing we have"
8156840,8163480," slots have you considered using std array or the like instead of having a fixed cr race with uh"
8163480,8173000," dissociated uh length uh what is dissociated length what do you mean by the disassociated length you know"
8173000,8179160," oh this one okay so it's like a separate uh i don't use std so that's the problem"
8179160,8187160," here i don't have std uh the only thing i have here is aids i use aids instead of std and std uses"
8187160,8192360," dynamic array like it has dynamic array but i need fixed arrays because they're easy to manage you"
8192360,8198440," don't have to manage any memory so that's pretty much the answer right i don't have std i use aids and"
8198440,8204920," this way i don't have to manage any memory so that's how easy it is does make sense not sure"
8208600,8213640," and by the way aids is my own library that is supposed to be a replacement for std you you"
8213640,8218680," can you can check it out here if you're interested uh do you consider revealing your address so we can"
8218680,8226680," send some gifts maybe uh well not really like you literally asked me do you consider doxing yourself"
8226680,8230120," no i do not consider doxing myself"
8231080,8236760," ice cold witch thank you thank you uh now you will lose all your computer knowledge after getting boomeries"
8236760,8242760," infected with boomerism yeah this is what it is"
8247880,8257960," i don't have std i use aids yes that's exactly what i said um anyways so we have uh item slots and now"
8257960,8262280," what i have to do here i just have to iterate through all of these item slots"
8263880,8268200," and it's going to be something like uh items to drop after death count"
8268200,8279080," plus plus i all right and we just take this item and i suppose we just iterate uh"
8279080,8286520," how many times how many items we have here so size j"
8288040,8296120," uh and j has to be less than that plus plus j there we go um and now on each iteration we have"
8296120,8300760," to spawn an item but i don't remember how to spawn items it's part of the game interface"
8300760,8310040," so it had something like spawn uh item at oh yeah that's pretty cool so you can spawn an item at a"
8310040,8317160," particular position that's actually quite easy to do so you do game spawn item at and we're going to"
8317160,8324200," use position of the entity entity has its own position and uh the item that we want to spawn is"
8324200,8330040," the item inside of that slot right inside of that slot and this is just an item there we go"
8330760,8343240," it's as easy as that we can even turn this into like a separate uh method entity uh drop all items"
8343240,8350920," right and you'll have to provide the game here uh drop all items you will just actually i i want to"
8350920,8359640," remove all of that uh six like this and after that uh we're gonna set items to drop after death is zero"
8360760,8371720," uh entity item uh where will will the compiler tell me will the compiler tell me oh okay it will"
8371720,8378120," probably tell me because uh the types are different yeah thank you uh item okay so and then we can do"
8378120,8388600," something like drop all items all right so yeah when you kill it and then we drop all items"
8388600,8399720," you can rent uh the post office box in academia and transfer uh access to it to those in so privacy is"
8399720,8410680," concerned uh yeah this is what i mean seriously you think i didn't understand what you meant"
8410680,8414840," you really think i didn't understand what you what you meant"
8422760,8429960," oh i see i see i see what you mean uh sure but i don't have that uh and this is not the primary"
8429960,8435080," concern uh of mine so maybe later i will implement that thank you so uh"
8435080,8441800," thank you thodian thank you thank you and thank you you're great beat thank you so much thank you for"
8441800,8450360," all of the uh happy birthday wishes so because we're dropping all of the items uh maybe i still want to"
8450360,8456440," to rename that uh i kind of want to rename this entire thing to just items thank you advic 77 thank you so"
8456440,8468280," much uh yeah i'm gonna do it like that and entity hpp replace yeah this uh and maybe i can do it like"
8468280,8478280," that as well there we go so this is how we drop all these things and then uh was it items count excuse me"
8479400,8490600," it was items count um so yeah we're dropping all the items but that's not enough boys and girls that's"
8490600,8498680," not enough we need a way to actually add items to the inventory right so we have inventory but you have"
8498680,8508280," no way to add an item there so let's implement a function that does that shall we so entity uh push item"
8508920,8515800," so this is how i'm gonna go and uh we're gonna push a single item and maybe how many of these items"
8515800,8522760," we want to push there so something like that and for now we're gonna do a simple assert for now we're"
8522760,8532040," gonna simple assert just to ensure that the items count is uh less than items capacity capacity so that's"
8532040,8537720," that's that's for now i know it's lame i know it shouldn't be better but that's the thing about"
8537720,8542920," software development you just make a first approximation and then you extend it as you need it"
8542920,8551720," okay i do understand that this code is not finished because the game is not finished right all right so"
8551720,8558040," and after that we can take the items and then items count plus plus and we're gonna put this thing like that"
8558840,8564120," uh so if i remember correctly so the first one is an item and the second one is account so this is how"
8564120,8570840," we're going there we go so this is how we're pushing it cool uh now let's try to compile that and see if"
8570840,8577080," it compiles uh i'm gonna compile only something bug thank you janik thank you thank you thank you"
8577080,8583560," thank you for all the happy birthday wishes i'm really flattered i'm really flattered that people do care"
8583560,8593640," about my birthday thank you so much so uh items so i think we just need to include that thing there"
8593640,8599240," so how to include something uh items hpp"
8602920,8609640," all right let's recompile that mass recompile that and it says that there's no such thing as items"
8609640,8611720," maybe there is item a single one"
8611720,8620680," now consider this option oh you guys talking about the thinking"
8627560,8635800," so uh entity hpp so i since i'm using headers right in c plus plus if you have a function it also should"
8635800,8643080," be available in header because you know c plus plus c plus plus is c plus plus"
8643080,8655400," very old language okay uh no declaration matches oh okay i have to keep adding this thing to"
8655400,8660840," to header files i cannot just you know define them in a single place i have to duplicate the declaration"
8660840,8661560," into places"
8661560,8671080," c plus plus my favorite language of all time so invalid use of a pointer struct"
8671080,8676440," oh incomplete pointer why is it incomplete let's include the game then"
8681880,8688840," you made a pull request oh okay let's take a look so you made the pull request too soon so while it's"
8688840,8694360," loading hopefully it's loading please load uh include something"
8694360,8703080," uh game hpp let's see what's going to happen hopefully it's not going to do any recursive thingy"
8703080,8711080," imagine you oh i think it did a request i think imagine game oh god damn it oh god damn it okay"
8711080,8716040," you you created a manual page okay"
8720040,8739000," and it does build on all of them all right uh looks good to me"
8739000,8747640," uh thank you for your contribution i'm gonna check it out after the stream thank you so much"
8748920,8755880," uh i'm gonna merge it for now yeah that's cool thank you thank you thank you thank you all right"
8755880,8763240," so uh yeah we did the lucky that's for sure and uh also probably potentially oopsie doopsie"
8763240,8775800," um so it has to be cpp uh it's entity it's entity and incomplete pointer huh incomplete pointer you say"
8777560,8783640," just merge it uh why not it seems to be building it doesn't break the build so why not just merge it"
8783640,8789160," uh i'm gonna check it out later so will you use it in the in the freebsd package"
8789160,8793320," so i think i think you should use it in the freebsd package"
8799400,8803560," what is your opinion what is your opinion on tdd what is tdd i don't know what it is i'm sorry"
8803560,8812360," um okay so how can we resolve the circular dependency is it even possible to do something like that"
8812360,8817560," trust during development never heard of it what is it what is it um"
8819560,8825400," sounds really strange okay uh i feel like yeah"
8825400,8835960," um so the idea is more or less correct okay the idea is more or less correct but"
8835960,8843960," uh these methods should be methods of the game t-driven oh i know that one i do know t-driven"
8843960,8847960," development but i never heard about test-driven development i'm sorry um"
8847960,8859880," i'm programming for 15 years and i've never heard about tdd thinking i'm sorry so what is it never"
8859880,8867000," heard of it okay so you see these are clearly the methods of the game so let's actually move them to the"
8867000,8878600," game okay let's move them to the game uh to the term we'll see how it goes yeah sometimes you just put"
8878600,8885880," your methods in the wrong place you just put them in the wrong place and that's something that you have"
8885880,8894120," to fix how to quit coffee well i don't think you're asking correct question you don't quit coffee you quit"
8894120,8900200," coffee in uh but you can if you don't want to quit coffee and you really want to quit coffee you can"
8900200,8909480," just start drinking tea how to quit life you should not quit life uh we yeah uh please seek help if you"
8909480,8915480," have suicidal thoughts you can also always google up the uh suicide hotline uh hotlines and stuff like"
8915480,8921640," that they're pretty easy to google in in your country in any country actually so yeah"
8921640,8928680," software driven development is a software developer just relying on software requirements being converted"
8928680,8933800," to test cases before software is fully developed and tracking all software development by repeatedly"
8933800,8938440," testing so very interesting that's a very interesting idea could you please elaborate on that idea i never"
8938440,8946680," heard of that before right so who uses that uh yeah what companies use what famous people use that idea"
8946680,8951560," please elaborate i never heard of it thank you thank you so much i really appreciate that because i'm"
8951560,8958840," just trying to learn everyday new things uh and if you explain me like more about this idea i would"
8958840,8965480," really appreciate that uh because this thing sounds like a pretty cool idea not gonna lie uh all right"
8965480,8973080," so here's the entity and what should we accept here i think we should accept the entity uh pointer here"
8973080,8979640," right so and this is exactly what we're gonna do so entity drop all items and this is uh yeah boy"
8982600,8988440," tell you man yeah i'm gonna do that i think my manager is gonna like that idea i think it's a fabulous idea"
8988440,8996920," thank you thank you so much all right so um so we spawns my items and then uh i'm iterating through the"
8996920,9007240," items of the entity right so items of the entity god damn it multiple curses me up yet again"
9009160,9017000," entity entity yes this is not what i wanted okay so i don't know why it's doing it like that but yeah"
9017000,9026440," that's it's kind of strange that's kind of strange all right cool"
9026440,9033480," so and maybe because of that we'll have to go to the entity and replace"
9035080,9043480," uh replace uh like remove the kill thingy um what is the best thing for development to be driven on"
9043480,9048520," money i guess i don't know uh"
9048520,9053480," where's the kill"
9053480,9061000," yeah there we go so let's remove that so this is going to be our primary refactoring and let's just go"
9061000,9068600," through all the errors that introduce money during development exactly uh so instead of this thing um i"
9068600,9076600," think we should call it kill entity so this one is kill entity drop all the all items of entity"
9084040,9089480," development development development well that sounds like a recreational programming like development"
9089480,9093480," for the sake of development uh kill entity"
9093480,9101720," actually yeah kill entity and uh we're gonna just use this as an entity this is how we're gonna do that"
9101720,9104920," and this is exactly what we're fixing right now"
9106760,9113160," so what else uh mixer player killing entity was not declared in the scope aha so i need to add them to"
9113160,9122520," the header entity spawn okay so there is a whole section for entity things so kill entity"
9122520,9126040," ddd"
9128280,9134440," i like the amount of d's d's nuts i'm sorry um"
9134440,9140280," okay i'm 30 years old by the way"
9140280,9144920," okay good exactly"
9144920,9151480," so here's the position it has to be the position of the entity"
9155560,9157480," okay item"
9157480,9162040," no matching function call"
9162040,9172200," is that the other way around i think that's the thing it's the other way around that's probably what"
9172200,9177080," it is that's probably what it is do we have anything else"
9180440,9181000," hopefully"
9181000,9184200," it will compile"
9184200,9189640," so um drop all all of uh of entity"
9189640,9193480," i think this is the last one i think this is the last ever"
9193480,9198520," and we'll be able to have the inventory system that uh you know"
9198520,9206520," um automatically drops all of the items but the problem is that uh the entities don't have any items"
9206520,9212440," whatsoever so if enough if i create some like a golem here uh and i try to kill it"
9212440,9218040," it still didn't drop anything because we didn't give them any items"
9218040,9223640," right so that's the problem so let's actually go ahead to the entity constructors entity yeah"
9223640,9232840," it's they are called entity constructors uh and push some items to them right push some items to them"
9232840,9240360," so here is enemy entity so it has a water gun i don't think it's going to drop anything uh golden"
9240360,9245080," entity okay instead of pushing a weapon we're going to push an item and the item that we're pushing is"
9245080,9255240," going to be in depends on what kind of items do we have so make a dirt block item uh position of that"
9255240,9261400," item i think is not that important yeah i think oh god damn it okay"
9261400,9267400," that means when we're placing we'll have to modify the position okay so i'm going to do it like that"
9267400,9274040," or maybe we can do it like this so initially they're going to be like zero initialized or something"
9274040,9282280," yeah that could be cool so we can define position but you don't have to all right so golem has dirt block"
9282280,9292920," item uh ice golem push item has ice block item especially make ice block item and it would be nice"
9292920,9299800," to rename them to not have make to make it a little bit more declarative and that should be it actually"
9300840,9309800," all right so um i think i also have to provide the amount of them so it has to be one oh you know"
9309800,9315880," what uh we can also provide the default argument so push item right initially it's going to be one so"
9315880,9321000," if you're pushing something you can you want to push like one of them right and in the game uh when"
9321000,9327080," you're dropping all of the items you take that item you're not only pushing it but you also want to"
9329240,9331240," modify its position um"
9331240,9335720," oh you already provide the position so in spawn item at"
9335720,9342040," it's modified okay that's perfect i already considered that nice nice nice nice so i already"
9342040,9346520," took that into account that's pretty cool oh thank you just roxy also thank you thank you i"
9346520,9349880," didn't understand your message at first because it's translated from russian but"
9350360,9359720," you see now uh thank you um all right all right all right uh it seems to be working now so uh if"
9359720,9371320," i now spawn a golem and i try to kill it it dropped the dirt block and if i pick up that dirt block it"
9371320,9378680," increased my amount of dirt blocks so that's cool so and since the player doesn't have any items when the"
9378680,9384760," player dies it doesn't drop any items as well so okay that actually solves like problems that we had"
9384760,9390440," before with the inventory system we introduced like an actual inventory system to uh actually facilitate"
9390440,9398920," that all right that looks cool um yeah so now things are dropping items and that's amazing in my opinion"
9398920,9405160," um so are we in the right branch yes yes yes um"
9407400,9414760," okay introduce inventory like simple actually it's just a simple inventory system"
9414760,9423480," for uh for enemies for enemies to drop items okay so i'm gonna push that right into the ribbon"
9423480,9429960," uh so i also want to do a full build on my machine just to check that everything is okay"
9429960,9435800," so i'm also gonna try to uh build a release uh thank you thank you at that thank you so much yeah"
9435800,9440280," cool"
9442680,9451800," so we're just waiting for the release"
9451800,9457320," we're just waiting for the release i also ran out of tea"
9457320,9463800," okay so everything seems to be building correctly uh and i already pushed everything and let's create a"
9463800,9472680," pull request let's create a pull request release waiting room uh i guess i don't know when when it's"
9472680,9482120," going to be released so i didn't have any particular deadline which is probably bad um but it is what it is"
9485720,9493640," 304 okay so let's create a pull request cool i also want to check out notification just in case maybe"
9493640,9496200," somebody submitted something to me that i need to check out"
9500760,9508520," god damn github is slow uh okay so fix windows error not failing the build"
9508520,9516760," oh yeah we had that problem before we had that problem before um by the way i'm gonna address uh"
9516760,9522680," these uh notifications a little bit later i might as well actually address something here like today"
9522680,9528200," because we're doing something but snitch i i want to look into that a little bit deeper so if whoever"
9528200,9531480," submitted that is watching right now i'm gonna look into that a little bit later"
9531480,9537560," my 30th birthday is in 45 days well"
9537560,9547720," it's not that it's not painful to be fair so you just become 30 years old boomer and"
9547720,9552280," that's it it doesn't really change anything at least it didn't change anything for me like"
9554440,9558040," i got the yellow t-shirt though maybe that's what happens maybe on your like"
9558040,9561480," uh 30th birthday you're also gonna get a yellow shirt"
9561480,9571640," uh okay so fix uh windows say i build not failing uh yeah so it's it's kind of similar situation"
9571640,9580280," here as well uh you suddenly grew a beard yeah unfortunately it's kind of funny like i'm still 30"
9580280,9587400," years old and i still not cannot like grow a proper beard something with my jeans probably i don't know"
9587400,9590680," not like i want to like i don't really care"
9590680,9595000," what happened to the casual t-shirt uh"
9595000,9600440," i didn't wear it for quite some time for some reason i don't really like it"
9600440,9610760," it's pretty old to be fair it's pretty old uh all right uh looks good to me shazawak oh my god"
9610760,9614680," hello shazawak welcome to the stream how are you doing uh looks good to me"
9614680,9622200," you shaved off your unix beard today god damn it rip rip"
9623720,9631000," f in the chat for heaven plus bird uh you're fine nice i'm really glad to hear that uh all right"
9631000,9638440," thank you for your contribution there we go"
9639960,9645240," um to do and let's do a merch cool"
9645240,9648440," streams okay thank you"
9648440,9655560," thank you i really appreciate you telling me that like seriously and ironically"
9655560,9661240," because for a second like i already switched the context right and my brain started to panic and then"
9661240,9667560," i saw your message and then i restored the context and yeah yes it's it is my birthday today shazawak so"
9667560,9677320," i finally became a 30 years old boomer yes today is my 30th panic up for 20."
9677320,9684520," thank you thank you so much for three months actually 15 months three three is just a streak"
9684520,9690680," 15 months of tier one subscription thank you thank you so much and welcome to our epic boomer clap"
9690680,9697080," 30 years old boomer clap uh yep yep yep thank you thank you shazawak thank you so much"
9697080,9704840," uh all right so um yeah looks good we actually have a lot of contribution to soon today so soon"
9704840,9708600," becoming better and better feels birthday man indeed"

9786600,9795800," a good looking snake game hire an artist or learn how to make good looking assets literally the answer"
9796840,9802280," for reinforcement learning project i'm new to c++ happy birthday i think good looking has nothing to"
9802280,9809960," do with c++ you just need actually artistic skills rather than programming skills so i would recommend"
9809960,9817240," you to look into that it's either improving your distance or artistic skills or hiring an artist or"
9817240,9822040," asking maybe you have an artist friend who can help you and thank you for wishing me happy birthday thank"
9822040,9829800," you thank you thank you a date that transform people into boomers yes exactly thank you p and q and go out"

9835400,9842280," and he asked what's nine plus ten and the kid answered 21 that's it oh okay i see oh by the way"
9842280,9847640," that's a good suggestion upper suggested or steal art yeah yeah this is another option you can also steal art"
9847640,9858360," so hope that answers your question uh okay so um i think we already can um merge but i i mean i'm joking"
9858360,9866040," actually but still not still so but i think you can buy some assets like some of the websites provide"
9866040,9874440," uh free assets like open something something open art game uh yeah open game art so we can find free"
9874440,9881960," assets on websites like that um some other websites have like paid assets i think unity yeah yeah unity"
9881960,9887720," has like a built-in like a workshop or something i never tried unity like i tried it once but i never"
9887720,9895080," went in like deep into it so yeah oh thank you up and thank you for wishing me happy birthday so"
9897000,9904760," github provides good looking snake games nice one so basically i just have like a placeholder assets"
9904760,9911640," from this website but i do plan to make my own assets eventually um but yeah it was a joke obviously"
9911640,9917160," don't steal art like stealing art is not a good idea because people actually spend like so much time and"
9917160,9931000," effort creating it unless they give you permission to do that um so introduce a simple in inventory"
9931000,9939000," system for enemies to drop items okay so uh and let's just merge this pull request permission to steal"
9940120,9945480," do you have permission to steal my art yeah it's a special pirate license"
9945480,9954680," it's like a gpl general pirate license right so that grants you permission to steal"
9954680,9963880," the piece of work um all right so uh let's actually catch the latest stuff"
9965720,9973400," yeah i knew that yes that's what it is actually origin master and uh let's"
9973400,9980440," remove this thing okay cool uh so let's take a look at the pull request that colombetka suggested"
9980440,9989960," uh add dim color to entities rendering so what's the problem here i think after some refactoring we uh did"
9989960,9995240," the oopsie doopsie and even a little bit of fucky bucky uh so let me rebuild everything"
9995240,10006120," i'm gonna jesus christ crazy wolf 770 you wish you good health and happy birthday thank you so much for"
10006120,10013480," 60 dollars that's a lot thank you thank you thank you and thank you for warm wishes uh i really appreciate"
10013480,10022040," that you didn't have to like the to be fair the sum is suspiciously uneven"
10022040,10027400," i'm hoping that you're not donating your last money last money"
10027400,10038760," so oh okay okay so it's actually uh 50 euros okay it's 50 euros but in in notification it got converted to"
10038760,10045640," uh two dollars uh and that's why it wasn't even okay okay so thank you thank you so much it just"
10045640,10052440," it's just look a little bit so suspicious okay thank you crazy wolf 770 and i really appreciate warm wishes and"
10052440,10055960," and the support thank you so much um"
10055960,10065080," first donate this year exactly exactly all right so what i was talking about uh look so when you are in"
10065080,10072840," the room room room is actually lit up in the sense that uh the tiles are brighter right in the neighbor"
10072840,10080520," room where you are not at english is hard uh it's actually the tiles are actually dimmed but if you"
10080520,10086760," enter that room they become lit up so essentially uh if you enter rooms they become lit up and stuff"
10086760,10093560," like that and that should happen to pretty much everything not only uh tiles but also entities and i think"
10093560,10101000," we have a bug that entities are not uh deemed when they are in a different room so and this is exactly"
10101000,10108360," what columbia fixed if i understand correctly so let's take a look at his fix and verify that it works"
10108360,10117080," on our machine and merge it all right so uh let's fetch everything uh maybe i'm gonna only fetch from"
10117080,10124680," colin petka's record still his code i hope columbia gives me permission to actually use his code okay"
10124680,10133240," here's here's the thing how do i accept contributions so all of my code is under mit right all of my code"
10133240,10140440," is under mit and uh under mit you have if you have a copy of the code you have permission to use copy"
10140440,10147000," modify merge publish distribute sub license and so on so forth um and basically when people uh submit"
10147000,10153800," contributions to me i assume which is probably quite dangerous but i assume that they also submit those"
10153800,10161240," contributions under this license which gives me permission to uh you know use copy modify merge publish"
10161240,10165880," their code as long as they are contributed and they're usually contributed automatically by the github"
10165880,10171720," in the contribution contribution tab so that's how i do that unless people tell me explicitly that"
10171720,10179400," it's not licensed like that uh i usually assume it's mit so i hope that columbia is publishing his"
10179400,10187000," contributions under mit so yeah mit is quite good because if you contribute under mit it automatically"
10187000,10194040," grants the permission for me to use your code because it's in in license but i'm not a lawyer okay this is"
10194040,10202040," not a legal advice i've known nothing uh nothing about this kind of stuff just a disclaimer all right"
10202040,10212920," so uh i fetched all the changes from the column that goes so and it is one six okay so let's create this"
10212920,10220600," thing here and see what it's all about so again i'm in a different room i'm in a different room i'm gonna create"
10220600,10229320," an entity it's actually uh you know not dimmed now i'm gonna try to rebuild uh the combats characters"
10229320,10237000," pew pew pew and let's try to reproduce that problem yet again"
10237000,10248440," something debuggers something debuggers and uh yep the entity itself is dimmed i don't think it works for"
10248440,10256200," yeah it doesn't work for items but do we have an issue for items by the way uh yeah so uh the items"
10256200,10264440," should be a separate issue uh so this is one six display health bar differently for enemies"
10269160,10273880," are you sure are you sure it's all it's kind of suspicious are you sure that"
10273880,10288440," so you actually fixed okay so you fix that problem in the scope of that issue as well i see let me take"
10288440,10295960," a look so it was about the bar the health bar but you also fixed the dimming of the yeah it was two in"
10295960,10299480," one that's that's okay actually that's not okay uh"
10299480,10307880," yeah and they're not supposed to attack you if you're in a different room so their ai only works"
10307880,10316120," within a single within the same room as you are so and here you can have another entity and it will"
10316120,10319880," attack you attack you and if you're in a different room it doesn't attack you so only when you enter"
10319880,10326600," cool that's cool um all right"
10326600,10337560," looks good to me thank you for your contribution"
10338680,10345960," uh thank you so much uh and let's just merge that"
