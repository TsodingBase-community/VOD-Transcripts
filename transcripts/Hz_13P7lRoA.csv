880,6440," Looks like we're live. Hello everyone and welcome to yet another Azuzin session."
6440,11820," Let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start this stream."
11820,14480," Hello, hello everyone. Welcome, welcome, welcome."
14480,19120," So, Red Circle as usual, live on Twitch."
19120,23400," And what are we doing today on Twitch.television website?"
23400,35980," Today, we are generating cellular automata based on pixel art images."
35980,39280," Does it sound interesting? I think it sounds kind of interesting."
39280,42800," So, I'm going to give the link to twitch.tv.com where we're doing all of that."
42800,45320," I'm going to ping everyone who's interested in being pinged."
45320,48360," And there we go, the stream has officially started."
48360,54740," So, today we continue the project that we started yesterday, which I decided to call AutoSell."
54740,56560," But the name doesn't really matter, right?"
56560,59440," So, I'm going to give the link in the chat."
59440,60820," I'm going to copy paste it in the chat."
60820,65100," And for people who are watching on YouTube, potentially, we'll see, we'll see."
65100,66000," The winner gets tea."
66000,67940," I'm going to put that in the description."
67940,70500," So, let's take a look at the project itself."
70500,72200," So, I already, by the way, deployed it."
72200,73940," So, there is a website, right?"
73940,76880," So, since it's written in TypeScript, right?"
76880,77960," It's a web application."
77960,80500," So, this is how it looks like, right?"
80500,87200," And believe it or not, this is a straight-up Game of Life, Conway's Game of Life, right?"
87200,89280," It's that straightforward, right?"
89280,93220," So, this is what we spent two hours yesterday implementing, right?"
93220,94600," And you can see, this is a glider."
94600,96340," This is a Conway's Game of Life."
96340,98060," So, what's up with that?"
98060,101140," Why did we need to implement yet another Conway's Game of Life?"
101360,109180," We didn't really implement this thing in a conventional sort of way, where we would have, like, an if condition, right?"
109180,114500," If the amount of, like, alive neighbors is between two and three become alive and blah, blah, blah."
114500,115100," No, no, no, no."
115100,116400," We didn't implement it like that."
116400,120760," We implemented this entire thing as a transition table, right?"
120860,121760," So, let's take a look."
121760,123220," So, outer cell."
123220,127100," I'm going to go into the index.ts."
127100,132360," And this is the implementation of the Conway's Game of Life, right?"
133160,135880," So, this entire thing, right?"
135880,138980," It's a transition table, right?"
138980,145140," And the actual application is basically an interpreter of this transition table."
145140,147320," So, idea is the following, right?"
147320,151460," You have two states, dead and alive."
151460,155000," We denote them zero and one correspondingly."
155340,160500," So, essentially, each state can be used as an index within this array."
160500,164220," So, we have an array of two elements, zero and one."
164220,168320," So, if you are currently dead, right?"
168320,173080," So, if the current value is dead, you will get this table."
173080,176780," If you are alive, you will get this table, right?"
176780,181520," So, by doing this kind of thing, you picked a table, the current table."
181520,186660," And then, you have another two-dimensional thing, right?"
186660,188260," So, now we have a two-dimensional table."
188260,193840," So, the first dimension denotes how many dead neighbors you have, right?"
193840,200660," So, by determining the amount of dead neighbors, you're picking the row within this table, right?"
200660,205560," So, here you would put the amount of dead neighbors for that specific cell."
206460,213440," And, with a column, you would pick the amount of alive neighbors of your cell, right?"
213440,219780," And, thus, you compute the next state of your cell, right?"
219780,222360," You see, it's a simple lookup table."
222360,228480," And, the dimensionality of this entire thing is going to depend on the amount of states, right?"
228480,233400," So, since in Canway's Game of Life, we have only two states, this is a two-dimensional table."
234020,239240," In a three-state situation, you're going to have three dimensions and so on and so forth."
239240,247580," And, the entire thing is just like, you know, taking this entire table without even thinking what's in the table and just like interpreting it, right?"
247580,256980," Just like taking the current state of the cell, then counting the amount of neighbors of different states and just plugging all of that as an indices into this table and getting the next state."
257160,261500," So, why did we need to actually implement this Canway's Game of Life in such a weird way?"
261500,268540," Because we abstract it away from a specific cellular automaton, right?"
268800,274580," Now, one of the things we can do, we can, for example, procedure regenerate them, right?"
275060,281280," And, maybe try to find some interesting cellular automata, right?"
281280,285400," Or, furthermore, we can take pixel art images, right?"
285400,290540," So, I already, like, downloaded some pixel art images from the open game art, something like this."
290540,294500," They're actually kind of small, but I wonder if I can actually make them a little bit bigger."
295500,297060," Probably not, right?"
297060,301600," So, the Emacs only scales this specific number, but it doesn't scale the image."
301600,305780," So, one of the things we probably want to do, we want to open it in there, right?"
305780,306980," So, I'm going to scale it up."
306980,316840," Right, we can take these images and we can try to analyze them and automatically generate the cellular automaton based on them."
316840,319780," With, you know, some certain goal."
319780,323760," For instance, with replicating the whole image from a single pixel."
323840,324860," I don't know if that's possible."
324860,330700," We can try to basically traverse left, right, top, bottom and see the neighboring pixels left and up."
330700,336160," And, for them, create transitions that will recreate all of the pixels or something like that."
336160,336700," I don't know."
336700,337340," We can try."
337340,346900," Or, maybe try to come up with transitions that transition one image into another one and just actually sort of train this entire thing in all of the images."
346900,351240," So, the possibilities are limitless, right?"
351340,354000," So, we just represent this in a more abstract way."
354000,358340," And what we want to do, we want to play with this entire thing."
358340,360300," Like, we want to play with this entire thing."
360300,361080," Does it make sense?"
361540,371040," So, we spent yesterday's stream sort of implementing the engine for this sort of, like, cellular automaton, right?"
371040,377820," Because you need to write a little bit of code that can take this transition table and sort of interpret it, right?"
377820,380120," So, this is what we spent yesterday's stream on."
380120,389320," Today, I want to spend on actually, like, finishing it off and maybe generating some cellular automaton and seeing how they will, you know, behave, right?"
389320,391400," Maybe we will find something interesting, right?"
391400,392740," Maybe we will find something interesting."
392740,394020," Sounds good?"
394020,395000," Sounds Gucci?"
395000,396800," Sounds Atamaguchi?"
396800,397760," Hmm?"
397760,398140," Hmm?"
398140,398480," Hmm?"
398480,398740," Hmm?"
398740,399000," Okay."
399000,399940," So, we've got some subs."
399940,404340," So, we've got a sub from Doorbell Prod."
404400,409020," Thank you so much for four months of tier one subscription with the message, I'm so excited to see you, Toast."
409020,410580," I'm so excited to see you, to Doorbell."
410580,414220," Thank you so much for gifting money to Jeffrey Bezos."
414220,416040," He really, really needs those monies."
421680,428140," So, as you can see, it's already deployed on the GitHub pages."
428140,430200," It's super easy because it's a static application."
430200,431220," You can find it in here."
431220,433660," You can play with it if you want to."
433660,437000," You can just make it go wild, right?"
437000,438360," And it's just going wild."
438360,439880," There is no autoplay in here."
439880,442720," Maybe we're going to implement it at some point, right?"
442720,447240," But it does, in fact, look like Game of Life, right?"
447240,449340," So, there is one problem."
449340,454240," There is one problem with this kind of representation of cellular automotons."
454240,457640," It is that it is extremely wasteful, right?"
457640,465200," It is extremely wasteful because here we use, for this sort of like inner tables,"
465200,471860," we're using indices as the amount of neighbors of certain state, right?"
471860,475220," So, but here is an interesting thing."
475220,480040," You cannot have more than eight neighbors."
480040,484300," So, the whole amount of neighbors is straight up eight, right?"
484300,486280," So, essentially, if you take a look at the square,"
486280,489700," you are at the center of the square and these are your neighbors."
489700,493880," If you count the amount of neighbors, you will see that there is no more than eight of them."
493880,500680," So, that means no matter what kind of states of cells you have in here, right?"
500680,501680," It doesn't really matter."
501680,506000," Their amount will always add up to eight, right?"
506000,508340," So, for instance, let's actually call it D."
508340,517200," We have two As, we have two Bs, we have three Cs, and we have one D, right?"
517200,522140," If you sum up this thing, you would end up with eight, right?"
522200,525680," And it doesn't really matter how many states you have."
525680,536140," All of them are going to sum up to eight, which means that not all of these cells in this specific table are even valid cells."
537460,540540," Like, not all of them are even valid cells, right?"
540540,544540," So, it's a huge waste of space, right?"
544540,549940," And we want to have a little bit of better representation for this entire stuff."
550280,554780," So, because we have, like, this multidimensional sparse matrix, right?"
554780,557120," Do you guys know what is a sparse matrix?"
557120,565220," I think there is a notion, I heard that notion from people who develop things like BLAS, BLAS library, right?"
565280,569000," So, for linear algebra and stuff like that, right?"
569000,577080," I interacted with these people a little bit, and they threw around a notion of such things as sparse matrix, right?"
577080,588760," So, and the idea of sparse matrix is that you have a huge, huge matrix, but the majority of the elements in that matrix are filled with zeros, or maybe ones, or primarily with zeros."
588760,595860," And you have, like, a few, like, islands of some numbers here and there and there, but the majority of the matrix is just freaking zero."
595860,603740," So, representing this kind of matrix in, sort of, in two-dimensional array is a straight-up waste of memory, right?"
603740,605360," So, people usually don't do that."
605360,608060," So, they come up with such things as sparse matrix."
608060,613400," So, they represent, basically, they only store these islands of numbers, right?"
613400,614200," And that's it."
614200,617320," And they assume that the rest of the numbers are zeros, right?"
617320,622860," So, that way, you, essentially, cut on the amount of space, right?"
622860,625260," So, that's basically what's going on here."
625260,626820," We can do a similar thing, right?"
626820,629680," We can actually do a similar thing, right?"
629680,634400," So, each individual index is basically an array of numbers, right?"
634400,638060," So, essentially, let's imagine that we have five states, right?"
638060,643060," So, that means the amount of neighbors is going to be one, two, three."
643060,644880," We already have six of them, right?"
644880,647080," So, this is going to be two, and this one is going to be zero."
647080,650180," So, all of them add up to eight."
650180,661320," We can try to use this array of numbers as sort of a key, as sort of a key in the object, right?"
661320,669680," So, maybe instead of this two-dimensional thing, we're going to have a single object where the key is this sort of array."
669680,676940," But, as far as I know, you can't really use arrays as the keys in a JavaScript object."
676940,680060," This is not particularly a thing that you can do, right?"
680060,685280," So, but we can be a little bit more observant in this specific case, right?"
685520,693360," So, since all of the indices here are going to add up to eight, none of them ever are going to be greater than eight."
693360,695320," They're only going to be equal to eight."
695320,698840," And eight is less than ten, right?"
699220,707280," So, that means it is super easy to just convert all of these things into string, right?"
707280,712440," All of these things into string and just turn them and just basically join them."
712440,717260," And this is going to be a unique ID for that specific combination of neighbors."
717600,718740," Does that make sense?"
718740,725600," Because you would never have four states and the amount of neighbors of the fourth state is going to be 20."
725600,729900," You will never have that because all of them always have to add up to eight."
729900,734520," And eight is less than ten, so that means it will always take up one digit."
734520,739900," So, you end up with a string where a single character is a single state, right?"
739900,744880," so that means you can just like uniquely represent that specific point in that multi-dimensional"
744880,753380," matrix with just this string by concatenating their indices does it make sense right and that"
753380,758160," greatly simplifies the whole thing right so essentially these are the indices and then you"
758160,764540," can say okay when you have one neighbor of that state two neighbors of that state three neighbors"
764540,770360," of that state two neighbors of that state and zero neighbors of that state right in that state you"
770360,780780," switch to the state two like this and maybe for so the rest of the things that are not set up"
780780,788220," we can have some sort of a default key which is going to be always zero right that way we basically"
788220,794060," represent it like a matrix it's not really a matrix right so when you have multiple dimensions this is"
794060,799880," not a matrix this is called i think tensor right i'm not a mathematician i have no i have no idea how"
799880,805520," it is actually called but yeah so basically you have this sort of like a five-dimensional table"
805520,813740," uh which is completely filled with zeros and only at that specific point it is two and it tells that"
813740,819240," in this specific combination of neighbors right in this specific combination of neighbors you have to"
819240,827740," switch to the state two right so that's basically the the idea of sort of compressing this entire thing"
827740,834960," so uh i was thinking how to compress this entire representation of the seller automaton uh of screen"
834960,840420," and this is what i came up with i think it's a pretty reasonable for uh for javascript right so it kind"
840420,846240," works well within javascript with you know uh with all of the objects and stuff like that it's it's relatively"
846240,861240," easy right so we can try to do that so the question is if i have uh something like this how do i join"
861240,870360," all of that into a string i have no idea right so javascript join array of numbers is that a thing you"
870360,878860," can do how can i join an array of numbers into one concatenated and we can't really see the rest of the"
878860,886760," message one concatenated numbers yes how can i do that yes somebody asked that specific question uh you"
886760,895480," just join it right uh you just join it so you can do something like that but you have commas oh this is"
895480,901820," because you have to provide this separator so that's how you can do that isn't that poggers i think that's"
901820,909140," pretty freaking poggers uh you know dynamic languages am i right dynamic languages so it would be kind of"
909140,915600," nice to maybe create some sort of a type for this uh kind of table because we are programming in typescript"
915600,922040," right so we have a statically typed compiled language uh we compile in a statically typed language into a"
922040,931000," dynamic one um and maybe we would like to have an interface right uh something like uh something like"
931000,938700," i don't know state so it's more of a state transition uh but essentially uh i want to say that it's going to"
938700,948700," have uh basically some keys of string and can learn them to a number so i remember typescript i remember"
948700,960680," typescript uh typescript interface um key value yes something like that there was a sort of like a"
960680,969280," syntax to sort of represent the key value stuff like indexing for indexing specific interfaces i don't quite"
969280,979520," remember um so yeah this one yeah so essentially you can create an interface and can say uh okay so"
979520,985700," it's going to be like a string right so it accepts a string and it returns a number right something like"
985700,994420," this so and then we can uh even say something like that it's also going to have a field default uh it's a"
994420,999500," keyword but if i remember correctly you can actually rub them in parentheses and uh also have it as a"
999500,1005600," number right so and uh this is going to be a legit interface that you can uh actually use to represent"
1005600,1014680," things so this is just a single state and uh then maybe right so this is basically a single element in"
1014680,1021860," this specific array right it's a specific array maybe we're going to also have a type automaton"
1021860,1028640," automaton which is basically the array of states and we can say that the game of life specifically is"
1028640,1034900," automaton right automaton there we go so uh after that maybe we want to try to recompile all of that but"
1034900,1041380," let's actually do the following thing where we take the uh you know typescript and run it in a watch"
1041380,1047040," mode right so it will constantly recompile this entire thing right it will constantly recompile"
1047040,1051680," this entire thing as you can see it is in the watch mode and it's completely fucking failed because of"
1051680,1058200," course uh i changed the uh the signature of this entire stuff right i changed the signature of this"
1058200,1063100," entire stuff and probably have to uh you know fix that so here we have an array right two-dimensional"
1063100,1075000," array so the row that we set one at is at zero one two three four five right okay so it's five and a"
1075000,1083060," column is zero one two three so it's 53 so essentially instead of this specific element we want to have"
1083060,1093540," uh an object right uh an object with a key 53 that switches to one and the default one right and the"
1093540,1100300," default one is going to be zero right so we say that one specific thing in here is going to be one"
1100300,1106600," and the rest of them are going to be zero and thus we compressed this entire thing into just this"
1106600,1114060," isn't that cool i think that's pretty cool look at that compression look at that compression just"
1114060,1117220," squeeze that mother flipper um"
1117220,1117420," um"
1117420,1124980," um can you say automating the atomic tomato automation"
1124980,1127460," 10 times no i cannot say that 10 times"
1127460,1138380," uh because you didn't donate ahaha anyway uh so and i'm primarily because i'm i'm trying not to be a"
1138380,1141420," clown i'm trying to be a software developer right"
1141420,1148640," okay so i'm here to develop software uh so now we need to introduce these two ones"
1148640,1156180," right we need to introduce these two ones uh so this one is located at zero one two three four five"
1156180,1164320," six so it's six zero one two 62 not even 69 and 69 we're never going to be you know we have a 69"
1164320,1173180," uh because uh it doesn't add up to two right so this is a 62 and this is going to be uh this one"
1173180,1180160," and as far as now this one is 53 as well right so it's five three so this is a 53 uh there we go"
1180160,1188300," and the default one is going to be zero right so there we go uh and we managed to compress"
1188300,1196100," this entire thing into uh just this specific table right so uh now we probably want to go through the"
1196100,1201300," compilation errors right so let's actually go through the compilation errors and actually fix them"
1201300,1210280," uh right so this is going to be tsc and i'm just going to run it i'm just going to run it"
1210280,1215260," okay so let's go through this entire stuff so state uh oh"
1215260,1225360," uh-huh so i already have a type state and it's a number okay so this entire thing is not really a"
1225360,1230860," state it's a transition right let's actually call it transition so automaton it's a transition and"
1230860,1234240," transition there we go so i think it makes a little bit more sense now"
1234240,1247020," so we have an implicit this thing in here uh it says something about automation implicitly"
1247020,1258980," uh-huh uh-huh can't be used to index type number to index type number that is kind of weird not going"
1258980,1265060," to live uh right okay so i see what's going on so essentially here is the neighbors what we have to do"
1265060,1273520," uh is basically join all of that stuff like so and hopefully that will work right hopefully that will"
1273520,1281880," work uh-huh so it seems to be working so it's compiling and now it actually worked so it was relatively"
1281880,1287620," easy but here's the thing so this specific transition right so we can even do something like transition"
1287620,1295580," transition transition like so and then just put it like that so we may not have that specific"
1295580,1302660," combination in that specific transition so if i understand correctly in that case it will basically set"
1302660,1310580," uh next to undef undefined and uh because of that we can do the following thing if next r c"
1310580,1319100," turn out to be turned out to be undefined we're going to set this entire thing to uh transition"
1319100,1327900," transition uh default right so we're taking the default thing in here and that's basically it so"
1327900,1334980," yeah it's actually kind of cool so the whole thing that computes the next um the next board is rather"
1334980,1340800," uh small is just a look up in the transition table it's a simple look up in the transition table and the"
1340800,1348460," transition table itself is also rather small right so this is actually kind of cool right it's actually"
1348460,1354780," super cool i really like that um so let's see it seems to be compiling right it does in fact seem to be"
1354780,1360740," compiling and let's actually open that in uh in the browser right let's actually open that in the browser"
1360740,1370080," uh so let me see uh this is the what is it called glider right so this is a glider and it seems to be"
1370080,1374800," working right we can try to break the glider right we can try to break the glider right we can try to break"
1374800,1382460," the glider by uh removing one of the rules right so here you're supposed to have uh two alive cells"
1382460,1389200," or three alive cells we can actually say that you you only can have three of them right and it's going"
1389200,1393700," to be a completely different game now right i probably don't have to recompile it because i have"
1393700,1400660," auto recompile uh right so if i put the glider in here it is not going to yeah it's doing something"
1400660,1405960," weird it's not gliding because it's a completely different uh cell or automaton right so it's"
1405960,1414040," completely yeah it turns into something funny ha ha ha funny if you know what i mean right so it's"
1414040,1425880," actually this kind of thing then go to a live like aha funny funny funny funny anyway so uh and it in fact"
1425880,1435320," right so would you look at that would you look at that so we can actually try to code more different"
1435320,1443660," cell or automaton automaton right so because game of life is not the only one uh right in fact some time"
1443660,1451340," ago i was already experimenting with cell or automaton uh and the project that was working one uh was called"
1451340,1458840," i think a tomato right so basically what i did i just like went through uh one of the famous"
1458840,1465020," cell or automaton and just implemented them in c right so there's a rule 110 but i don't really care"
1465020,1471400," about rule 110 because it's one dimensional can't waste game of life and things like seeds for instance"
1471400,1477820," have you guys heard about seeds cell or automaton or maybe about something like brian's brain"
1477820,1485480," everyone heard about uh you know game of life but have you heard about seeds the god seed"
1485480,1493000," cell or automaton or brian's brain and brian's brain is actually very very fucking cool it's it's way more"
1493000,1499380," um it it's cooler than uh game of life right at least the pattern that emerges out of the brian brain"
1499380,1507120," uh are really uh are really fucking cool so oh there's also wire world uh yeah which basically"
1507120,1513780," which is really really interesting because it's a very simple uh cellular automaton which implements"
1513780,1520340," like a semiconductor logic but it's a convey game of lifestyle cell or automaton but it behaves like"
1520340,1528240," semiconductors so you can make computers out of that right so uh and it's extremely fascinating it's just"
1528240,1534460," like why a world uh as far as i know it just consists of several just state like three or four states uh"
1534460,1541920," four states right it's literally four states uh and you can have like a logic gates in here uh right it can"
1541920,1549380," like conduct some stuff it can just like do interesting shit holy shit i should actually maybe spend like"
1549380,1556900," another sort of like a stream playing with this thing i don't know it's kind of cool it's so this kind of"
1556900,1563900," shit is so underrated why nobody's talking about this shit right why nobody's talking about this"
1563900,1567880," it's just like four states and like a transition and we can probably implement all that stuff"
1567880,1575360," um right anyway so i'm gonna give the link to the automata project right so there's also a couple of"
1575360,1580300," other things in here that i didn't implement i plan to implement maybe i'll get back to them at some"
1580300,1589080," point but yeah so i'm gonna give the link to uh to here right so and uh i'm gonna also put that in"
1589080,1593300," the description for anyone who's interested in this kind of scheisse"
1593300,1602080," coding trains talked about interesting so i should probably search for you know for one of his videos"
1602080,1607920," where he talks about this kind of stuff so let's try to implement seeds uh as far as i know seeds is"
1607920,1615500," one of the simplest one right seeds is one of the simplest one so you have two states yeah so this is"
1615500,1624180," actually really cool so just grows like cancer basically yeah uh so and i don't remember the"
1624180,1631440," rules so and the rules are basically described in um with words right it consists of an infinite"
1631440,1637420," two-dimensional grid of cells each of which may be in one of two states on or off each cell is"
1637420,1643900," considered to have eight neighbors more neighborhood oh this is called more neighborhood okay so uh i think"
1643900,1650140," i knew about that but i forgot about it so the thing that i usually compute is called more neighborhood"
1650140,1659280," all right so i'll try to remember that so in each time step a cell turns on or born if it was off or dead"
1659280,1665960," but had exactly two neighbors that were on all other cells turn off those in notation described in"
1665960,1677560," so let's actually try to encode the seeds and see if it will you know behave like seeds so this is seeds"
1677560,1689320," this is an automaton uh automaton uh there we go so it has to be uh this thing so if this thing was off"
1689320,1695480," right if this thing was off but had exactly two alive neighbors"
1695960,1700920," we have to turn it on right we have to turn it on so if you have two alive neighbors that means you"
1700920,1707080," have six dead neighbors because this kind of stuff has to add up to eight uh right and then uh we can"
1707080,1714440," say something like default and by default it is equal to zero right in case of one uh right in case of one i"
1714440,1723480," suppose yeah i suppose if if you were alive you just die essentially you simply die uh all right so in that case we can"
1723480,1725480," just say uh zero"
1725480,1735480," and that's it that's how we encode the uh seeds several automaton so we're going to basically"
1735480,1743640," enable it by finding where we use goal and just to replace goal with seeds uh right so we still use goal"
1743640,1748360," in the name of these things so maybe i'm going to actually query replace this name and get rid of the goal"
1748360,1757400," prefix because it's it's irrelevant now or maybe it would be even cooler to basically accept the automaton"
1757400,1766440," as an argument of this function right so it will be even cooler so let's call something like automaton and"
1766440,1774200," this is going to be an automaton uh there we go and here we're going to just do automaton luckily we're using a"
1774200,1779720," proper language uh right we're using the proper language so that means we can just go to the"
1779720,1786920," compilation errors and easily refactor everything isn't that poggers isn't that poggers i think it's"
1786920,1795640," pretty freaking poggers mate so what the hell is going on so uh yeah i forgot equals of course i forgot equals as"
1795640,1798280," usual happens to me all the time"
1798280,1806760," okay let me compile so uh here we provide the two states and what i'm going to be doing i'm going to just"
1806760,1812760," provide in the seeds right so i'm just providing the seeds and i think that's it right so because i call"
1812760,1821320," this thing only once so that means that should work so interestingly i also provide the amount of states"
1821320,1827240," right and the amount of states is really important when you're computing the neighbors right because"
1827240,1835560," essentially you may look at the neighbors and you may find uh you have neighbors only only of two states"
1835560,1842040," but you are operating in a universe that you can have five states so that means you need to indicate that"
1842040,1848200," the rest of the states you haven't seen uh you know you have zero of them so because of that you need to know"
1848200,1853960," how many states you have in your cellular automaton so that's why i was also passing the states because"
1853960,1862040," it's kind of a very important uh sort of variable but i think we know the amount of states in the automaton"
1862040,1868120," right because in a automaton you have an array and the size of the array is the amount of states you have"
1868120,1874280," in a cellular automaton so basically by passing this entire thing you pass this thing as well so you don't"
1874280,1881560," really need to pass it anymore right so in the place where uh you use that we can just use automaton"
1881560,1890920," automaton automaton uh length and that's it right emacs is just being weird today you know what i mean"
1890920,1896760," so we can even like we pass all of the necessary information to actually you know uh look up the"
1896760,1902680," neighbors and stuff like that so i think it's it's pretty poggers isn't it i think it's absolutely freaking"
1902680,1908440," poggers all right so it's actually going here so we don't have to provide this thing anymore so it's"
1908440,1913640," just seeds yeah this is actually kind of cool compute next board you provide cell automaton the current"
1913640,1914920," board and the next board"
1920760,1929560," so that's pretty cool i like how the requirements guide the refactoring of the code you know what i"
1929560,1936920," mean right so you don't try to you know architect or design your application up front right you don't"
1936920,1941640," try to do that you just like look at your current requirement and you implement the minimum amount of"
1941640,1948600," code to feed this requirement the requirement change and you make the minimum amount of refactoring to"
1948600,1955480," accommodate those changes and the architecture evolve itself in it adapts itself to the new requirements"
1955480,1960520," all the time you need don't need to uh actually architect up front right and doing that is actually"
1960520,1967720," all virtually impossible because you may not predict uh the requirements up front right so rather spend"
1967720,1971800," the minimum amount of effort to accommodate the requirements and that's it you just spend the"
1971800,1980200," minimum amount of effort so that means you made the most optimal thing uh right so and it just like evolves"
1980200,1987720," right you just have to look for it right you compress these things and just yeah this approach takes"
1987720,1994680," skill and experience exactly like any good if you want to have good"
1994680,2007720," uh get ready to pay for it there is no free good of course uh so anyways um okay it seems to be uh"
2007720,2013320," compelling already right so let's see if the seeds actually work right so i'm gonna refresh this entire"
2013320,2018840," thing so i'm gonna put uh the glider in here and it should not work right it should not work"
2019960,2023320," because this is not conveys game of life um"
2023320,2031480," and yeah ironically i'm not even using my local application i'm using the deployed application so"
2031480,2038520," it's a wrong thing right so this is this is the right thing uh and let's try to yeah that looks like seed"
2040520,2047320," yeah so it does in fact grows like a cancer so the cool thing about the seed is just like it's it's"
2047320,2054520," when you you know it when you see it right so it has a very characteristic uh sort of behavior it"
2054520,2060040," just like grows like a cancer it's just like yeah yeah it's it grows and there is like a static noise"
2060040,2066760," inside of it uh right so that's what's interesting about it and it's just like as you can see at some"
2066760,2072600," point it just like consumes with the static noise uh you start with like two things in here and it's"
2072600,2077640," just like that well i mean this one just collapsed but they usually they don't collapse they just"
2077640,2085960," perpetuate indefinitely why are they collapsing on me today i don't know i have a go now it starts"
2085960,2092760," growing it starts growing like a cancer we don't really have like a good resolution for for all that"
2092760,2098280," so the cool thing in here is that uh we didn't really modify the logic of the engine right we"
2098280,2104200," didn't modify the logic of the engine we just changed the uh the transition table right so it's"
2104200,2109160," just like a different transition table and nothing else so i wonder if i can just like increase the"
2109160,2115000," resolution and make it make it 64 for instance right i think i should be able to do that uh it also"
2115000,2119560," would be kind of cool to be able to just draw this entire thing so right now i have to like literally"
2119560,2127480," click and it's not particularly convenient have a go look at that so i also off screen i made the"
2127480,2133800," board wrap around right so because i don't want to implement the infinite one i just like make it wrap"
2133800,2142040," around uh right so and it's so cool to see like emergent behaviors out of these things it's so freaking cool"
2143720,2152600," uh i really like that so but then at any point you can switch uh the current you know think from seats"
2152600,2158680," to be goal uh right from since to the goal and it's completely different cell automaton right so this one"
2158680,2165320," uh is going to just work fine right so this one is not going to grow or collapse or anything so this is a"
2165320,2173880," classical game of life just a different configuration uh of the transition table so let's try to go into"
2173880,2180440," more complicated ones right uh so the ones that have three states for instance right so for example brian's"
2180440,2187480," brain so the coolest thing about brian's brain is that it introduces the um actually third state on top of"
2188040,2197000," dead and alive it has a state dying right so essentially if you are alive you're switching to"
2197000,2203880," dying and if you're dying you're switching to dead so it adds a little bit of the uh of the time while the"
2203880,2209880," cell is dying but apart from that if i remember correctly it acts like seeds it's just seeds but with"
2209880,2215240," the cell slowly dying and it creates a very interesting effect you would say like just"
2215240,2221800," basically it's dying longer but while the cell is dying it actually blocks other cells from spawning"
2221800,2227960," in there and that creates even more interesting emergent behavior right it's actually very very cool"
2227960,2233160," so let's try to encode this and i think uh let me let me see"
2235560,2238760," uh let me let me see so this is the how the emergent behavior looks like"
2238760,2246440," so yeah it creates a lot of gliders like flying around in orthogonals and stuff like that which is so freaking cool"
2246440,2250440," uh right so let's go ahead and try to implement this thing"
2250440,2258200," uh so consists of finite two-dimensional grid but unlike seats each cell may be in one of three states"
2258200,2264440," on dying and off each cell is consists of have uh okay the cells turns on if it had it was off"
2264440,2271800," but had exactly two neighbors that were on just like birth the rule in a seats all cells that were on go"
2271800,2277560," into dying uh which is not counted as on uh right and prevents any cell from being born in there"
2277560,2283640," okay so let's introduce uh brian's brain automaton"
2283640,2293000," uh there we go so this is the automaton uh so this one is zero so that means we're gonna say that this is the"
2293720,2301240," dead one right so this is the dead one uh one is uh life life uh and"
2301240,2308440," this one is going to be two and let's say that this one is going to be specifically dying"
2308440,2314680," uh implementing dying is really straightforward right so basically regardless of the of your neighbors you"
2314680,2322520," you always switch to dead right so it's almost like programming a turing machine right it's like"
2322520,2329960," yeah this table is just like a small turing machine that reads the amount of its neighbors"
2329960,2337880," the read operation is the amount of the neighbors based on that it doesn't really write anything it just"
2337880,2340920," switches the yeah it's literally a turing machine holy"
2340920,2347480," it's actually pretty cool i really like that"
2347480,2355160," okay so as far as i know if it's alive uh right so in case of the seeds it will just straight up go"
2355160,2363480," to be dead uh right but here we have to actually switch to uh to dying right if we're alive we always switch"
2363480,2371080," to dying if we're dying we always switch to dead right and in dead we don't really care about the dead"
2371080,2377320," neighbors we become alive only when have two alive neighbors right and we don't really care about the"
2377320,2384920," dying neighbors as well uh right and essentially we have to switch to one so essentially i put sort of"
2384920,2390760," wild cards in here right we don't really have such syntax in our table interpretation but essentially"
2390760,2395640," what i'm trying to say in here is that we need to generate all of the possible combination of these"
2395640,2401080," two numbers that add up along with two to eight so effectively we need to come up with all the"
2401080,2407880," combination of numbers that add up to six eight minus two right so this one is basically going to be zero"
2407880,2415560," six right this one adapts to eight so essentially when you have zero dead neighbors two alive and six"
2415560,2422920," dying this is a valid transition to alive so as you can see this is sort of like a flow in the design"
2422920,2430600," of this table right but it's only a flow if you are manually creating them it's not particularly convenient"
2431160,2439640," uh to create this kind of stuff manually but again it was not really designed to be uh to be modified"
2439640,2446040," manually so i do that just to test things out right so because of that i'm i think i'm okay to do it like"
2446040,2455880," that for now uh right so but generally if i were to uh you know code this kind of stuff like manually i would"
2455880,2461080," probably come up with some sort of like a wild card syntax that allows me to match uh certain things"
2461800,2467160," right so these are possible combinations in which we have to switch to one so as you can see adding"
2467160,2474920," new states adds you know uh quite a few how to say that the combinatorial complexity right so because you"
2474920,2480840," have to take into account all these combinations and stuff like that so by default uh we don't really"
2480840,2486360," care about the rest of them so we always stay at the depth and i suppose this is the brian's brain"
2486360,2493880," encoding right uh brian's brain encoding uh of the cellular automaton uh right so let's actually see"
2493880,2498200," if we didn't do any fucky wacky and potentially an oopsie doopsies"
2498200,2509720," so here's an interesting thing so we have three states in here uh right but our ui editor supports only two"
2509720,2516280," of them right the dead and live we cannot create uh dying one right because it just literally uh we"
2516280,2523000," literally had coded the amount of things in here but as we start interpreting things i think uh i think it"
2523000,2530600," will still draw it right because we have a so-called color table yeah color table and essentially we can"
2530600,2535880," display up to four different states right so if you have like three states i think it's going to be"
2535880,2542280," rendered with green so the dying cell is going to basically green uh all right so did i actually"
2542280,2548120," switch to yeah i didn't switch to brian's brain so let's actually do that uh we don't have any errors"
2548120,2554440," right okay so let's actually put some stuff in here and let's try to compute the next cell and"
2554440,2561560," as you can see everything i put in here uh is actually switched to dying so it worked right so it"
2561560,2567800," means yeah we can continue and it collapsed so maybe we need to have more of these things right"
2567800,2573960," so let's actually try to do more of this stuff and see how it's gonna go yeah there we go now we see"
2573960,2579800," the patterns now we see this entire thing growing that's actually so cool and it's working right it works"
2579800,2589080," exactly as you would expect so this is a brian's brain yeah it creates like a lot of orthogonal gliders"
2589080,2594040," right so sort of like an emerging behavior of the brand and it creates this kind of thing that's"
2594040,2602120," actually so cool i love it yeah it's it's pretty it's really tripping and what we're doing in here"
2602120,2607080," we're just modifying the transition tables right we're not really modifying the code the logic per se"
2607080,2611960," uh right so all of that is transition tables so that means you can kind of generate this kind of"
2611960,2619880," transition tables maybe i don't freaking know uh look at that look at that uh spaceship it creates so many"
2619880,2627400," spaceships yeah this is so fun"
2627400,2635960," yo and they're gonna actually collide again because it's it's wrapping around so uh one of the things we"
2635960,2642680," probably need to have uh right we need to have some sort of autoplay right autoplay"
2642680,2654920," another thing um basically drawing uh drawing the cells right because right now i cannot just hold down"
2654920,2659320," and draw right they have to click click each individual thing it's not particularly convenient"
2660040,2670200," another thing i would like to have is probably uh you know automatically give me the like like populate"
2670200,2676360," the radio buttons right so because radio button uh buttons are hard-coded uh so what we can do"
2676360,2685640," we can basically have a global variable uh like the current uh automaton it's called bb and since we"
2685640,2691720," know the size of the current automaton uh we can populate the radio buttons so depending on the current"
2691720,2700200," automaton you can basically like uh set like any sort of state right so any sort of state so this will be"
2700200,2717240," actually kind of nice um so outer uh populate populate um radio buttons based on the current uh automaton"
2717240,2726760," how do you spell populate pop you i don't really know so i'm gonna ask google how do you say populate"
2726760,2731240," i think i spelled it correctly maybe so it's actually single l i'm sorry i don't speak english"
2731240,2738600," uh right now typically i write your buttons so this is basically from the usability point of view right"
2738600,2745880," something that i would like to have um interestingly enough right now we just have a global table of"
2745880,2753000," colors right global table of course and uh so the index of each individual element corresponds to the"
2753000,2759560," state associated with that specific color right what if we have more than four states right how many states"
2759560,2765400," do we have to accommodate in here i don't think it's a particularly great idea to do it like that"
2765400,2772360," uh i think what would be better is to maybe for a specific transition to have a color associated with it"
2772920,2779720," right just get the color from here right so here we have a default transition and on top of that we also"
2779720,2786760," have a color associated with that specific state in that specific cell automaton i think that's a good"
2786760,2792040," idea actually so and get rid of this global table so basically each individual transition table also"
2792040,2798440," includes how to color itself and you know what it's going to be extremely useful when we're going to start"
2798440,2805880," generating the cellular automatons based on the images right because yeah right because the image also"
2805880,2810840," um so what we're going to do we're going to iterate through all the pixels of the image"
2810840,2816680," and we collect the unique pixels and the collection of unique pixels uh unique pixels is going to be the"
2816680,2825000," the amount of states of that specific uh cellular automaton right uh i think i think that makes sense right does it make sense"
2825000,2833240," i think it does in fact make sense uh right so uh let's actually quickly do that i suppose right so if i just"
2833240,2842120," add color in here and just command out this color in here right so it will create a lot of compilation"
2842120,2851000," errors that i'm going to be forced to uh fix where cute people uh i can show you cute people uh so"
2852200,2859400," so people are asking where is cute people so this is what we have in here uh yeah these are cute people"
2859400,2860760," are they cute"
2860760,2870600," so uh i probably need to actually so here is the license uh so cc by you you may use this graphics"
2870600,2875960," in person commercial projects credit uh yeah so that's the creator of the this is the artist right"
2876600,2883080," created by human not an artificial intelligence so i actually downloaded it on open game art"
2883080,2890520," uh right so it's actually pretty cool pretty cute uh icons so i specifically chose them because they're"
2890520,2897000," very small and they're have a limited amount of course so they're kind of perfect for several automatons"
2898600,2905160," uh very cute indeed so"
2905160,2909640," uh cute people i think"
2909640,2919960," yeah there we go so it's this one um i can copy paste the link in here so if you're maybe interested in"
2919960,2925640," other works of this altar uh you can check them out so they created a lot of cool stuff look at that"
2925640,2933000," i wonder if the you know ai is gonna is going to ruin this kind of website because people may"
2933000,2937080," start posting generated by ai or something this is actually super cool good"
2942120,2943720," oh we like that so"
2943720,2953480," so i'm going to did i put that in the description so i think i definitely need to put that in the"
2953480,2961800," description all right because i want to create this person uh cute people oh yeah yeah"
2961800,2967640," so these are the cute people we have"
2969320,2975240," all right i was going through the compilation errors i suppose uh so color string uh is not"
2975240,2986920," color property color of string is not assignable to uh string this is really strange i wonder why"
2986920,2998600," property call of type string is not assignable to string index type number ah i see i freaking see what's"
2998600,3007320," going on these two things conflict with each other you know what i think i can remove that"
3007320,3018920," right because uh interface sort of like defines like a subset uh subset of the fields right required"
3018920,3027400," like a minimum subset of the fields and color and default are in fact the minimum the bare minimum of the fields"
3027400,3033080," that means that you have to have any transition right because uh you may have like a default which doesn't"
3033080,3040920," uh really like it ignores all the neighbors right but it has to have the default and the uh and the color"
3040920,3046200," right so if we're gonna have more on top of that that's like you know your choice right so that's the"
3046200,3055240," transitions you defined and stuff like that so yeah i guess that's that's good that's good okay that makes sense"
3055240,3063960," it would be kind of cool to encode some sort of like invariance uh that we put into"
3063960,3072760," the keys in here yeah it would be kind of cool to somehow on the level of a type system to encode that"
3072760,3082920," the string consists of digits and the digits add up to eight so but i i don't think the typescript uh type"
3082920,3090920," system is so powerful so that we're able to encode this kind of stuff um maybe in some in something like"
3090920,3096760," jai it will be possible to actually write it like that so it is possible to write it like that i wonder so"
3096760,3103160," it basically can have um so javascript code that is executed at the compile time"
3107720,3116920," also so yeah enjoy you can just like literally run any code at compile time"
3116920,3129160," but there is also a lot of runtime when we're going to be training our automata uh so these keys are going"
3129160,3135560," to be runtime values so that means they has to be checked at runtime so we'll see i don't think it needs to be"
3135560,3142280," this strict right now uh okay so let's actually define the colors uh so this is the color"
3142280,3150760," and uh let me just grab 2020 so all of the dead colors are going to be the background right so they're"
3150760,3157320," going to be 2020 2020 so all of the alive are going to be"
3157320,3166280," are going to be reddish sort of speak right they're going to be a reddish"
3166280,3175640," so game of life the same uh the dead is going to be that uh the alive is going to be that"
3177000,3184200," and uh the brian's brain is really interesting all right because it has three states"
3184200,3187480," uh-huh so"
3187480,3189640," 50"
3189640,3198040," so this is alive and this one has to be green so i'm going to put f in here"
3198680,3206440," uh okay so i don't think we need this global table anymore right so let's see what other places we have"
3206440,3214600," to modify i think i know why there is a watch mode for for typescript compiler uh so 69 number is not"
3214600,3223480," assignable to type transition really i thought the interface is sort of like a superset isn't it can i say"
3224360,3235080," uh something like this i don't freaking know right is is there any way to say that uh i have more i can"
3235080,3242360," have more types in here or is that not possible to say at all it's not not possible to say at all"
3248840,3255960," um so i suppose we have to do some stupid like key string string or number"
3255960,3259800," that is dumb"
3259800,3270600," so i could have just programmed directly in javascript what's the point of typescript at this"
3270600,3278680," point anymore i don't know anyway uh so what do we have in here uh is not assignable to number"
3279160,3283960," and now you you're starting to have this kind of shit right so because you don't have a guarantee"
3283960,3293240," this kind of stuff is gonna be a goddamn number a goddamn number so essentially one of the way we"
3293240,3298680," can fix this entire stuff right i suppose one of the way we can fix this entire stuff is maybe"
3300280,3305800," uh to say that transition right transition is"
3305800,3315240," you know it's something's like it has this separate table so to speak right"
3315240,3318600," so"
3318600,3325960," basically a separate thing in here but i'm not sure how to call this entire thing so this is a transition"
3326600,3335560," um right so i would like to call this a state right so this is a state and it has a certain color and"
3335560,3342760," certain default and this is transitions right these transitions and that would make more sense in my"
3342760,3352280," opinion uh right but unfortunately i already called state just a number uh so but maybe i should call it a cell"
3352920,3358600," right i should have called this entire thing a cell uh right i think that makes a little bit more sense"
3358600,3360440," okay let's actually go to the compilation errors"
3360440,3374520," all righty so what do we have in here so i have to actually use uh the cell in here right so this one"
3375320,3378680," number is not assignable to states that means i have to recompile it one more time"
3378680,3391240," okay what else do we have so this is the transitions uh did you mean css transitions no i didn't mean that"
3391240,3396600," so it meant states uh okay so let's go to the rest of the compilation errors"
3398600,3408920," compilation errors so uh that means i have to do transition in here right transition"
3408920,3415240," so and i think it looks like a right thing to do right it just like separates that what you can have in here"
3415240,3421000," uh transitions this is going to be that uh i forgot the comma in here"
3422200,3427640," so the the entire thing the entire representation is a little bit growing but it's still smaller than"
3427640,3433160," uh if we used something like a straight up multi-dimensional array right in case of"
3433160,3439240," multi-dimensional array this kind of stuff could have been enormous uh freaking enormous this is still"
3439240,3448680," smaller than that so let's quickly do that and uh yeah this one is a big one so this is transitions"
3449880,3462600," and let's put it like this and let's put it like this there we go"
3462600,3465320," so"
3465320,3476440," transitions like this so i suppose i forgot to put a comma in here uh let's take a look at the compilation"
3476440,3481000," rose rose"
3481000,3490360," okay now we're talking so it's not assignable to a type string"
3490360,3497320," yeah that's true because i put string in here instead of a number thank you typescript yeah"
3499000,3506520," uh typescript is catching and errors that i wouldn't even uh have if i didn't use typescript right"
3506520,3515320," so uh okay so this one uh we can we probably want to call it a state and within a state"
3515320,3519560," we use transitions right so this is transitions we do that"
3520280,3527560," uh right and here we can do state default maybe i'm yeah so that should actually work"
3527560,3544200," okay so state course all right so this is where we need the colors of this entire stuff but we have it in"
3544200,3551080," the table in the table in the transition table so that means we need to accept a tamaton as an argument here as well"
3551080,3554920," look at that uh right a tamaton"
3554920,3560360," so because this is where we have all of that right so it's an automaton"
3560360,3565240," uh we take the state and then we take the color so that's what we have to do in here"
3566520,3574760," right uh did you make dying dead alive in arms no i didn't make them because we don't need them"
3574760,3583400," because of how we represent things they are not needed at all so uh right so we have a current automaton"
3583400,3593480," so maybe i need to uh pull it in here right so because now when we are rendering we do current automaton"
3594760,3603080," so this is the current automaton then we do current automaton and not board automaton"
3603080,3611000," on the current board to compute the next board then we swap them around and then we're rendering"
3611000,3615400," uh the current automaton yeah there we go"
3615400,3624040," so it's actually working out quite well i really like this i really like this so we're slowly factoring"
3624040,3624600," out everything"
3624600,3629800," big ass refactoring exactly"
3629800,3641160," big ass all right so uh let me see let me see you know what would be even cool you know what would"
3641160,3649960," be even cool uh right so in the um where is my page here in the page we have like a radio button right"
3649960,3655960," so it's just like a dead life and all that is hard coded of course but uh what i wanted to do is to make"
3655960,3663320," it um basically populate uh depending on the current automaton right and with each individual state we"
3663320,3670840," have a caller associated with it so what if we get rid of these names and literally put a square with that"
3670840,3679800," specific color in there so it could be viewed as a palette yeah so essentially a specific automaton"
3679800,3688680," has a palette associated with it right you you select a palette uh and then you can put that palette in"
3688680,3696520," here right and then maybe you can have a like a combo box where you can switch between several automaton"
3696520,3701480," and by switching it also switches the palette because it's associated with the current automaton"
3701480,3708360," and all of that is encoded in just a transition table right it's actually kind of cool right that the"
3708360,3717800," transition table like plus additional information just encodes everything uh right or you could add"
3717800,3726280," name next to color here's the thing i plan to generate those seller automata based on pictures"
3726280,3733480," and that means i don't have a human readable names associated with any of the states because they're just"
3733480,3739480," pixels or colors right because of that the names are just like really meaningless in that sense"
3739480,3746440," uh right they're kind of meaningless so maybe i don't want to have like associated names actually"
3746440,3751640," right maybe i only want to have a course because that's the direction i'm moving towards"
3751640,3759000," i will see we'll see we'll see we'll see we'll see all right so um yeah that's pretty cool so"
3759000,3764120," right now we have a brian's brain so this is a brian's brain and stuff like that uh so it will be"
3764120,3769000," kind of cool to raffle on all these to do's but i feel like i'm already spending too much time on the"
3769000,3775720," ui part of things i would like to do some actual computer science if you know i'd like to do some"
3775720,3782760," actual computer science and actually move uh on on trying to read the image right so let me actually"
3782760,3790120," open it in here uh right can i in uh you know increase this entire thing i i think i did a"
3790120,3799480," fucky wacky and potentially yeah right so i want to uh basically open up that uh read the pixels and try"
3799480,3806520," to transform all of that into uh the um into the transition table and stuff like that and see"
3806520,3810040," what kind of uh you know several automatons we can make out of these images"
3810040,3818680," right so but before i do that i want to make a small break because i've been slapping the code"
3818680,3825560," and doing big ass refactoring for entire hour without any tea because i pour myself a cup of water"
3825560,3832200," before the stream right so it was not a tea so uh right and i really need a little bit of a tea so"
3832200,3836260," let's make a small break and after the break we're going to continue slapping the code i'm"
