880,9840," all right and we're live as far as i can tell hello hello hello uh welcome welcome welcome"
9840,19680," so uh today is uh i don't even know what day today yeah today is wednesday right so and"
19680,26960," today i'd like to continue working on something that we started to work in one of the previous"
26960,34720," days right so uh the to-do app in rust and it was quite interesting for me so i'm using this to-do"
34720,40960," app development as an opportunity to actually um you know research a little bit on how to do"
40960,48400," immediate uis in um rust right not immediately right like immediate uh terminal uis it has"
48400,53040," nothing to do with rust to be fair like this kind of stuff can be done in literally in any language"
53040,56560," and it's just like rust it's just like i'm just using rust for this one doesn't matter"
56560,63360," uh so you can find the previous episode of this um of the series in here so it's going to be previous"
63360,71360," episode uh right something like this and uh the source code can be found in here right so this is"
71360,81840," going to be uh the source code uh where is going to be like this uh so did i actually uh put the link"
81840,86800," correctly okay so i felt for a second that i removed the character out of the end of this thing so"
86800,93440," hello hello everyone welcome to the welcome to the stream how are you guys doing so uh yeah let's"
93440,99920," continue let's continue let's continue let's take a look at what we've got uh so far uh so maybe we"
99920,106560," also want to fetch the latest changes just in case uh i don't think i introduced any changes today so uh"
106560,117840," looks good to me looks good to me so i'm gonna do team ux and i'm gonna cd uh forcing cd to this folder"
118560,119600," let's do cargo build"
119600,130720," all right so it's already built so the application right now uh looks like uh looks like this right"
130720,137120," so you have a bunch of to do's and you can basically mark them as done and they're going to be removed"
137120,141840," from the list but they're not really removed from the list they are moved to a list of done things and"
141840,148000," you can switch between uh done and to do with tap right as you can see now you you are in a"
149360,156000," in a done tab and uh you can switch back and from the done you can actually uh move things back"
156000,161440," to to this list right and if you quit it actually persists the state of this entire thing so if you"
161440,169600," open it again so yeah uh it will still have the state as you um as it was when you left the application"
169600,174320," and the format of the file where it persists its own state is actually quite simple it's just little"
174320,182800," literally that so um yeah i want you to like the ui right now is actually kind of meh right so uh i"
182800,189760," want to be able to actually see what needs to be done uh and what what is already done right so i want to"
189760,197200," kind of like have a two panel um ui where if i press uh you know enter on the left tab it will uh left"
197200,205200," panel it will move to the right panel and if i'm on the right panel it will move it back so uh and i"
205200,213360," think i even created the uh the issue for that uh and yeah two panel instead of tabs so i think this is"
213360,217200," going to be the first thing that we're going to be working on today two panels instead of tabs"
217200,228240," so uh what file you say with it's a text file it's just like literally uh 1970 technology that we had for"
228240,234800," 15 years so uh let me start emacs from within the development environment"
234800,245360," so i think this is the description right and let me see what we've got this one is actually rather"
245360,254160," interesting because um to be able to draw things into panels we need to be able to have the layouting"
254160,260800," system a similar layouting system that i actually put in all all of my immediate uis um so for"
260800,266160," instance the recent immediate ui that i actually developed i developed it for my game uh right so"
266160,274080," something uh right some do i even have an executable for that i don't have an execute oh this is because"
274080,282560," it's the wrong folder i'm sorry it's something uh rewrite right so and this is how it looks like so it's"
282560,287680," it's like actually not final look and feel it's just technological demo and here is the immediate ui"
287680,293680," that i actually developed uh and as you can see there is layouting in here so there's vertical um"
293680,300000," layouting and horizontal layouting and you can have this kind of sort of grids uh and i want to have a"
300000,306080," similar uh system but for the terminal for the terminal uis and by the way i developed this entire"
306080,313680," stuff on the stream as well you can find uh the recording also on the sodding daily channel so let"
313680,319120," me actually go there so ding uh so i'm gonna actually give you this thing"
319120,330320," so i think well there's two episodes in here but i'm gonna actually uh give the link to the previous one"
330320,345840," in here all right so uh it's gonna be description um so immediate ui immediate ui development stream"
345840,352160," right so something like this immediately means that renders and loop regardless of events uh immediate"
352160,358720," ui is something like i am gooey if you never heard about i am gooey i recommend you to check it out it's like"
358720,367360," basically like a canonical example of uh immediate ui um to be fair i kind of i don't know i'm getting"
367360,374240," conflicted i didn't think the immediate ui has to be a library right i think immediate ui is more of an"
374240,380640," approach than a library that you can just depend on or you can install via npm install or something like"
380640,386720," that it's more of like a general approach and wrapping it into a general purpose library kind of defeats the"
386720,393120," whole purpose but uh the immediate ui usually looks like this right you begin the rendering of the ui"
393120,399520," then you begin a menu bar and then you begin a specific menu and then items and uh it basically"
399520,406240," rendered immediately as an opposite of first preparing the ui tree right and then giving that tree to event"
406240,413680," loop and uh then uh waiting for the for the callbacks so that's basically what it means uh i think you like"
413680,421600," the better explanation would be the casey moratory talk on uh immediate uis that he gave in 2005 so i"
421600,426000," always leave the link to this talk in here we actually watch this talk also on the stream at some"
426000,433040," point so uh check it out um so i think i'm gonna actually put the links uh in the description as well"
433760,442720," so i am gooey so this is basically canonical example of i am gooey uh and the casey motorist talk"
442720,455120," all right all right all right so hello casey uh immediate uh ui i wish i could easily select this kind of"
455120,465280," stuff but i just can't do that uh all right so 2005 and it's going to be all in the description uh all"
465280,472400," right so that's basically what it means so and usually the layout it a layouting system that i"
472400,479520," developed for my immediate uis um is kind of similar to how qt handles the layouting system i'm kind of"
479520,486720," probably biased because i've worked with qt a lot um so yeah i'm gonna actually demonstrate it one more time"
488720,498800," demonstrate it one more time okay um so"
498800,512720," hello across 94 hello hello uh how are you guys doing um so essentially you have two boxes uh let me"
512720,518640," actually switch this stuff here so the first one is a horizontal box which means that whatever you put"
518640,527920," uh in that box right whatever you put in that box uh is going to be aligned horizontally right so"
527920,534720," something like this this is your uh horizontal box and if you have several of these things"
534720,540480," boom maybe i'm gonna actually not create too many elements because then i will have to edit too much"
540480,548560," and uh boom it's gonna be like that like that like that like that right so this is the um horizontal box"
549200,555360," then uh we're gonna have something like a vertical box there we go here's your vertical box and whatever"
555360,560000," you put into a vertical box is going to be aligned guess how it's going to be a light vertically"
560000,568880," uh to the two maybe it's a little bit overkill maybe i should actually get out of this like cutie mindset"
568880,576320," but so far it's working okay ish so i have no reason to get rid of it so in that way you can create more"
576320,585520," complicated uis right so for instance you have you can have a top level uh horizontal box right top level"
585520,592240," horizontal box uh that looks like this uh then inside of this thing you can have two elements"
592240,595200," that look like that"
599040,604160," and these two elements are going to be vertical boxes right so and inside of those vertical boxes"
604160,608640," uh you're gonna have uh uh other elements right so something like this"
617520,628080," drawing is something like that maybe and maybe uh here you're gonna have two of them right so"
628080,634800," to actually simplify like reduce the amount of time that it's needed to draw this entire stuff there we"
634800,640720," go so you can have like complicated stuff and whatnot and here is precisely what we want to do right now by"
640720,647200," the way we want to have two panels right to create two panels we need a horizontal box top level horizontal"
647200,653920," box with two uh vertical boxes and we're going to put all of the elements in those vertical boxes"
653920,661040," right so and i kind of like this system because it's rather flexible um and it's pretty quick but it's"
661040,665840," like i don't know some of the things are not easy to do with this kind of system so but for now i think"
665840,670400," it's going to be good because i've as i've already said i want to have two panels in there all right"
670400,676160," so that's going to be basically the idea that makes sense does it make sense hopefully that make sense"
676160,694480," hello or fan of cthulhu hello hello all right so let me let me see let me see uh we need to introduce"
694480,701600," again uh we are distinguishing between vertical and horizontal boxes right uh so that means we need"
701600,709600," some sort of like um box kind right so it's going to be box kind maybe uh and"
709600,719440," this one is going to be vertical and horizontal there we go so here's our uh box kind"
720320,726560," and um so there's like virus actually kind of getting in my way and let's also introduce the"
726560,734400," structure that uh represents the box itself right so and the box is going to keep track of its own kind"
734400,744240," and we also need to know where the box starts right so we need to know its position right uh and we need to"
744240,751120," know its size so it's going to be some sort of like a rectangle thing right so um so maybe we need to"
751120,759920," introduce like um like a point right if you know what i mean or maybe cell uh so it's going to be"
759920,768800," structure cell uh and it's going to be something like row u size row u size and then column uh u size but to be"
768800,776240," fair one of the things that encourages accepts in mv if i remember correctly so dogs rs hello hello"
776240,783200," everyone how are you guys in uh and courses maybe i should use crates here so it's just easy to find"
783200,786960," the communication maybe i can just open the communication locally let's open the communication"
786960,796640," locally so you're supposed to be doing something like uh cargo dock open is it a single dock yeah it is it's a"
796640,808960," a single dock forcing cd um uh oh so it needs to first document everything and only then it will"
808960,815680," be able to open it okay so and then it's finished all right all right so uh where is in cursus all right"
815680,824320," so let me go in here so this is going to be mv and mv accepts i32 right so that means it can be negative"
824320,832320," negative so since cell is going to be the source of data for the move right uh i think it may only"
832320,838240," make sense to actually make it i32 right i think it makes sense to make it i32 and"
838240,851280," so cell is already taken right cell is already taken uh point it's not really a point it's more of a vector"
851280,859760," okay so this is a vector 2d um maybe it could be like a point but yeah it should be fine so this is"
859760,864960," the position so it's a vector 2 and the size of the entire box is going to be also vector 2."
864960,872080," um do we need anything else do we need anything else to keep track of the box i don't think so actually"
872080,879840," i don't think so so let's have a couple of functions that uh we can implement um i suppose uh the way i"
879840,887200," want to construct the box i want to construct it by providing its kind and its position its size usually"
887200,892400," not known yet unless you pushed uh a special uh widgets in there so we're not going to provide the"
892400,899760," size then so implement box and we're going to have new and this thing is going to accept kind box kind"
899760,907440," right and the original position here uh vec2 and it's going to return self essentially so also we need"
907440,916240," to have a way to construct vector i suppose um i'm still thinking would be would it be better to actually"
916240,922480," have it look like this but unfortunately you cannot have like uh named tuples in here eh whatever let's"
922480,935840," create implementation for that to why not um uh look to fn new row i32 call i32 and it's going to be self"
935840,938560," and in self you just return row and column"
945360,953360," so uh hey would you consider alignment or will it always uh on top vertical uh left hazard i don't"
953360,967040," know yet because i haven't finished implementing things um you guys don't understand uh software"
967040,974160," development is a constant gathering of information uh you do things not because you know what you're doing"
974480,980880," you do things precisely because you don't know what you're doing so you start doing it and you hit"
980880,988320," problems and gather information and understand what you need to do uh so thinking that you have to know"
988320,995040," what you're doing ahead is a wrong mindset it's a wrong mindset and this is not how software development is"
995040,1004080," done no you basically gather information and develop things simultaneously answer to a question i have no idea"
1004080,1011200," i have no information if i need to keep things on i have no idea i haven't implemented anything yet"
1011200,1019440," so it's a incorrect question it's an incorrect question um all right"
1024320,1036880," so should we have a default i think we should also have a default in here uh derive"
1036880,1042560," so it's going to be coined"
1048560,1052720," size and i suppose size and i suppose size is going to be something like this right"
1052720,1056240," back to you"
1056240,1060480," i wonder like maybe in this particular case you can just do"
1060480,1065440," zero zero yeah so we'll just keep it as zero zero but i think"
1065440,1079120," yeah you can just do it like that okay cool"
1079120,1089040," uh what the am i doing so i should have actually done something like this"
1091520,1095920," um isn't this city oh of course"
1095920,1108320," rust like take it took way too many useful names for whatever reason okay so we'll have"
1108320,1109920," to rename this entire of course"
1109920,1118080," it's just like yeah so they went basically through a frequency in the english alphabet and they took the"
1118080,1122160," most frequent words and they actually you know put them in the standard library so you can use them"
1122160,1124560," um nice okay"
1124560,1128640," uh box layout"
1128640,1132480," all right so this has to be called layout"
1132480,1136480," so we have layout kind and"
1138400,1152000," um let me see what we can have in here"
1152000,1157360," so row isn't used and"
1157360,1160640," shit ton of warning because yeah sure"
1161680,1162240," uh"
1162240,1170560," uh no i need to have a stack because what we're doing in here as we uh so the way we're going"
1170560,1177280," to be using this layout by the way we're going to have a couple of special functions uh begin layout"
1177280,1178240," and end layout"
1178240,1183440," so something like this"
1185680,1195760," begin layout you're going to accept immutable self uh and um i suppose kind uh layout kind uh layout kind"
1195760,1205440," uh and then you're gonna have something like and layout right"
1208560,1209040," itself"
1209040,1219280," so and how would you develop uh something like this right how would you do something like this"
1219280,1227040," well um let's create something like that fn main right first of all you would have a ui"
1227040,1235360," right so it's you you're gonna create a default one uh and you begin layout and the layout you create"
1235360,1244400," is essentially a kind uh horizontal one right at the top level you have a horizontal one and then uh"
1244400,1253520," inside of this thing you're gonna have two vertical ones right ui begin layout uh layout layout kind"
1253520,1262960," vert uh and let's actually put this kind of stuff in here uh like this so you have a top level horizontal"
1262960,1267840," one one and you have two internal vertical ones and inside the vertical ones maybe you're gonna have"
1267840,1275440," some sort of like a loop for i in zero to five right where you're gonna be actually uh creating labels"
1275440,1282160," do we have a label yeah yeah well we do have a label uh right like this and i'm gonna put it here"
1284240,1294720," um so self is not needed anywhere and text is going to be essentially format like that uh label uh label"
1294720,1302400," like this and the pair we're gonna do something like a regular player right so and yeah there we go"
1302400,1309040," so this is how it's supposed to be used right and as you can see the structure of the code reflects how"
1309040,1316000," it's going to look like and what you're essentially doing in here you are traversing the ui tree but"
1316000,1323840," the ui tree that which doesn't exist at all right so first you go into the root then into this uh sub"
1323840,1330080," child and then into this sub child then by ending the layout you remove back and go into the next sibling"
1330080,1336320," sub child and so on and so forth so you kind of like uh traversing the tree but without the recursion"
1336320,1342160," you see what i mean you're like explicitly traversing tree in a look of like a flat matter"
1342160,1347920," right um if you right if you had like a tree"
1347920,1353360," uh looking like this right"
1355840,1361520," uh that's actually too too many elements but i mean these elements are going to need one two three"
1361520,1372800," four five six seven and then you will just flatten it out right one uh two three four five six uh seven"
1372800,1376720," and you will just iterate only the array of the snow that's basically what we're doing"
1376720,1384640," but we also need to know how deep we are in hierarchy so and because of that we need to maintain this stack"
1384640,1390160," of the layouts usually you don't have to maintain that stack if you're traversing things recursively"
1390160,1396560," right because you're essentially using the call stack right so that's why a lot of recursive algorithms"
1396560,1402640," they are so concise and don't require any additional structures because you are using the data structure"
1402640,1408480," implicitly right you implicitly using the call stack as a data structure so in here since we don't have"
1408480,1415440," a recursion we have to use a stack explicitly uh all right so and because of that we need to introduce"
1415440,1424800," the uh the stack of layouts uh so hello hello welcome to the stream how are you doing um so here we're"
1424800,1435520," going to have like a layouts uh vector of layouts there we go uh vector of layouts um and when i'm beginning"
1435520,1442640," the layout um that's a very very interesting"
1447040,1453680," so when i'm beginning the rendering at all i provide the position at which i want to start the rendering"
1453680,1458160," right so i'm providing the position where which i want to start so what i'm thinking is that i can"
1458160,1464720," collide or collapse these things into a single vector two right and essentially we don't need"
1464720,1470640," to keep track of the row and column anymore right we just need to push additional layout in here so"
1470640,1478880," it's going to be a layout uh push uh layout push and what we're pushing in here is the layout uh like"
1478880,1487440," this kind layout kind uh so the default one is going to be horizontal i suppose let's keep it horizontal"
1487440,1495840," right so and uh so then i'm going to have a position so i can provide the position in here and initial"
1495840,1506400," size is going to be uh essentially empty right so i'm in the mood to use new in here i was in the mood"
1506400,1512640," of using this thing here but i decided to use this thing here i don't know for the consistency let's use"
1512640,1522000," it everywhere uh doesn't matter um okay so another interesting thing uh i assume uh that"
1523520,1532880," this stack is empty in here so does it even have empty up on there um so back to can i have a vector in"
1532880,1540320," here uh so that means i need to do something like last box create std"
1547040,1576000," oh there is isn't okay so uh does it have is non-empty is not empty some languages do"
1576000,1583040," uh is empty uh is empty okay so this thing is not empty that's what basically we want to assert in here"
1583040,1587200," uh all right so does it even compile let's see"
1587200,1602800," okay uh so i need to remove this uh test example i don't think it's needed anymore"
1605280,1610560," so what do they have what do we have in here uh layouts uh this is because we need to do self"
1610560,1616480," and this is layouts of course uh self layouts of course"
1616480,1626000," okay so when i'm rendering the uh yeah yeah okay so one of the important things for the layout is uh"
1626000,1634000," basically calculate the position where you can place a new widget right so uh let's create a special function"
1634000,1640560," function which gives you available position available position uh so it's going to accept self but it's"
1640560,1650400," going to return uh vector two right and essentially it actually very much depends on the kind of the layout"
1650400,1660640," right so layout kind can i just do something like use layout kind like all of this uh out of that and then just do something like vert uh to do"
1660640,1667040," uh and uh uh horse right so something like horse"
1667040,1670400," uh"
1670400,1676480," all right so um where is my drawing stuff where is my drawing stuff"
1679760,1688480," so if you have horizontal layout right horizontal one we actually started with the vertical but whatever"
1688480,1696240," horizontal that means uh you can add a new widget in here widget right you can add a new widget in here"
1696240,1700480," if you have a vertical one you have to add it in here all right so let's quickly implement that"
1702400,1708800," so um so but interestingly enough that means i need to have some arithmetic operations on vectors because"
1708800,1714880," it's kind of inconvenient to um to do some of the things so let's actually see what we can do"
1714880,1721120," uh i think i suppose we'll need to implement a couple of traits and whatnot to make it actually work"
1721680,1728080," so uh so uh let me see we need to have add traits right so it's going to be uh yeah yeah"
1728080,1733440," yeah yeah so let's implement add for the vector yeah because we want to have this vector operations"
1733440,1743200," implement uh i think it's like implement add for vector two right and i suppose the output"
1744080,1754880," uh the output for this thing is going to be vector two uh right and public function add uh self"
1754880,1767680," and the right hand side right hand side has to be all right um self output so the way is going to be done"
1767680,1777840," we're essentially constructing a new self um new self uh where row is"
1777840,1790880," self row plus rhs uh row right and uh here we'll have to replace rows with columns right so here is a row and"
1790880,1797360," column cool uh so let me see if this entire thing compiles though the like"
1797360,1803360," a rust reports errors in a really weird order sometimes uh yeah you may have an error in the"
1803360,1807840," code but it's going to be reported like way after you fixed other errors because you know"
1807840,1817440," rust has to be like that uh so use std uh ops add so that's what we want to have in here"
1817440,1826880," so what else do we have in here summer colon uh all right do we have anything else rhs uh i suppose i need to"
1827040,1837600," specify uh yeah let's just do vector two okay so i'm not gonna try to be fancy or smart it's just"
1837600,1844720," gonna keep it like that all right whatever if it's gonna work it doesn't matter okay cool so i can add"
1844720,1855440," vectors now uh and i need to multiply them i need to multiply them uh so let me see impulse multiplication for"
1855440,1862640," vector two uh type output vector two it's literally the same thing by the way it is literally the same"
1862640,1869680," thing it's just like uh you have a different name in here and you have a different operation right"
1869680,1875440," so you literally have a different operation so and that way it should work i suppose"
1876880,1884400," um um i'm still not sure if i have to go with the row column situation or x and y"
1884400,1897840," you know let's go with x and y why not uh so it's going to be x and y so in here because of that"
1899120,1904560," this is going to be this is going to be a row x column y"
1904560,1912640," so row x column y"
1924720,1943200," and everything looks okay okay back to this thing so if uh you are here so here's your original"
1943200,1949680," position and you are horizontal layout you need to find this position in here so finding this position is"
1949680,1954880," relatively easy right so uh you need to"
1954880,1964640," uh you need to take self position and add size but on top of that you need to multiply this entire thing"
1964640,1971200," like that so you need to cancel out y right that means you need to put one and zero in here there we go"
1971840,1979520," so that way you instantly find this point in here uh because the y was cancelled out so and then we're"
1979520,1983440," going to have another thing in here so now we have a vertical one uh"
1983440,1997120," so uh this is not malt uh it's going to be mole looks good to me so this has to be called mole"
2001280,2005600," um"
2005600,2011600," all right so i think i implemented this stuff so now we need to start uh you know getting the"
2011600,2023200," information uh into mv so when i'm yeah so essentially now um before uh trying to render anything"
2023200,2030560," that requires a position we need to query the position uh from the layout stack right so we need to get the"
2030560,2037200," layout at the top of the layout stack and ask it the available position in there um so"
2037200,2044960," yeah uh let's see let's see how we can do that um so we go to the self layouts uh"
2044960,2048160," layouts and we get the last and as far as i know last"
2048880,2054240," uh actually returns you uh actually returns you option right because it may not have something so"
2054240,2059040," we can simply unrop it so essentially if um"
2059040,2066960," if you hit the situation when the layout stack is empty that means you're trying to render the label"
2066960,2070640," outside of the layout of the layout so maybe we're going to put something like expect"
2070640,2081040," trying to render layout our um label outside of any layout right so that's basically what happened in"
2081040,2089920," here um so in here uh i might as well actually do something like um you know the layout and i wonder if it"
2089920,2097600," returns if the last returns the reference i really wanted to return the reference uh because uh i don't"
2097600,2104240," want to copy anything right and i also want it to be modifiable yeah it needs to be modifiable so uh i"
2104240,2116800," suppose this should be something like last mute uh can you have last uh so yeah where's the last mute"
2116800,2123520," so wait i didn't click on that i didn't click on that"
2123520,2127600," oh my god it's so slow"
2129840,2142320," as mute that's really strange why can't i have last wait am i crazy vector"
2142320,2148480," i think i'm i remember quite vividly there was last"
2148480,2152560," where is it"
2158720,2166400," was it in the slice i think oh okay i think it was in a slice okay so uh yeah this is what i don't"
2166400,2170800," like about russ is that like the functions are all over the place you you can never know where"
2170800,2179520," things are um all right so last maybe there's also last mutable right so um yeah"
2184480,2193040," okay so and i wonder if i can quite easily just take last mutable right and there isn't i want to"
2193040,2196240," see if it's okay if it's a reference all right that's the only thing i cared about"
2196240,2203680," all right so in here uh i'll need to get the uh available position right so uh this is going to be position"
2205200,2213680," um layout available position right layout position and this way i don't even have to do it like that"
2213680,2222240," it's going to be y uh and it's going to be x there we go so and here we're updating the row but since we"
2222240,2228320," have a layouting system we don't have to do that we just need to tell the uh the current layout that"
2228880,2234320," there is a new widgets in there so uh let me see it's going to distract layout"
2234320,2240160," so this is available position we need a function that allows you to add"
2240160,2247680," uh a new widget right so it's going to accept it as a mutable one uh and it's also going to accept"
2247680,2254080," this size so it's going to be vector2 so right now it is not implemented all right so let's go back"
2255440,2266640," and in here uh it's going to be layout add uh widget and we don't really know precisely the size"
2266640,2274960," we don't really know precisely the size we know the height which is a single character uh but the size"
2274960,2282000," kind of needs to be consistent and i'm thinking that maybe we're gonna supply the width um"
2283600,2291600," with the function call right so let's do something like this so i could use the width at the text but"
2291600,2300560," uh then the layouting is going to be wait oh it won't yeah for now i think i can use text as width"
2300560,2308240," but then later i'll have to fix it into something yeah yeah anyway uh so i need to do like that back to"
2308240,2315760," two it's going to be new uh the height is one uh i know that for a fact but width is going to be text"
2315760,2321280," len uh there we go so that's basically basically what i wanted to do in here right that's basically"
2321280,2331120," what i wanted to do um and let's try to recompile this entire stuff um so text len this is i32 it's going"
2331120,2342560," the i32 uh and yeah ui begin also needs vector to new all right vector to new and all right so there's"
2342560,2349440," that there's a ton of useless warnings that don't solve anyone's problems uh move occurs okay so that's"
2349440,2355840," quite important uh vector should be copyable right so we need to derive copy and colon"
2355840,2359760," all right um"
2363200,2378640," apply to structs okay so struct okay so everything seems to be compiling perfect"
2378640,2388640," everything seems to be compiling so the thing i need to do now all right i need to be able to update"
2389280,2396320," the layout according to the size of the new widget right so essentially if you want to add a new widget"
2396320,2406560," right so like this here's your new widget that means the size of the layout has to be"
2406560,2416000," has to be extended uh like so right it has to be extend extended like so then if you add"
2416800,2423280," uh a new widget that looks like this right uh actually let's actually grab the different color"
2423280,2432080," right so which is a little bit like taller like that uh that means your layout cell has to be extended"
2432080,2438000," like this right to accommodate all of this stuff right and it's going to be slightly different depending"
2438000,2443600," on the orientation of the layout if it's uh horizontal it has to be done like that but if it's vertical it's"
2443600,2450240," the other way around right so if it's horizontal you basically append the size of the widget but uh in"
2450240,2456960," terms of why you basically find the maximum uh on the vertical layout is you swap that logic right so"
2456960,2462960," that's basically the uh the difference so as you append more and more widget the the layout cell expands and"
2462960,2467280," expands and expands to accommodate all of the all of the widgets that what you want to put in there"
2468080,2473920," so uh let's let's quickly do that and again it all depends on the kind of layout so we'll have to do"
2473920,2480800," this switch case in here as well so it's going to match uh self kind right it's going to be horizontal one"
2482400,2495120," uh to do and the vertical one right there we go uh hidden so in terms of a horizontal um"
2495120,2511840," so self uh size x right self size x has to be plus size x right but self um size y has to be a maximum"
2512400,2522800," between uh between uh the size y itself um what the hell am i doing oh yeah uh and and this size"
2522800,2529520," yeah there we go so that's basically the logic here if i understand correctly um hopefully i do"
2532320,2539760," the requested size you cannot request size uh you request position oh maybe that's not what you mean"
2539760,2546000," is larger than the sum of sizes of the content it leaves space but if you it's smaller than the"
2546000,2554960," concept then it expands to fit i don't understand the question the sum of sizes of the content uh the sum"
2554960,2564480," of sizes of the content depends on orientation uh it leaves space but if you smaller than its content"
2564480,2570240," then expands to fit i don't understand what you mean like it's it's kind of like really really big you"
2570240,2575840," can interpret your words in so many different ways i don't understand the question i'm sorry i'm stupid"
2575840,2586320," um okay let's continue um so we actually got disconnected but luckily uh my uh i'm still"
2586320,2593680," recording the stream so it doesn't really matter so uh and this thing what i need to do in here so i need"
2593680,2600080," to basically reverse this logic right so it's going to be self size uh x but then i'll have to do something"
2600080,2612560," like cmp uh max self size x uh size x and uh for the y it has to be size y plus uh size y"
2612560,2623280," so uh speaking of your question i really don't understand it because i'm currently thinking how to"
2623280,2630000," implement this kind of stuff but basically you have a box that just expands as you push elements into"
2630000,2637920," it that's it it's as simple as that as i explained here you have a box you push things into it it expands"
2637920,2647280," to accommodate all of the things i've that's it there's nothing for me much to say um all right so uh"
2647280,2648080," let's continue"
2648080,2653120," so"
2656000,2662400," let me see let's see so let's see if it compiles now so we don't have a cmp so i think i need to"
2662400,2667840," actually uh do something like this cmp yeah i'm going to just input cmp"
2667840,2672960," um all right"
2685040,2693520," do i have a new to do select okay so when i begin the layout all right uh i also need to request the"
2693520,2700880," position where i can place that layout it's also very important uh so let's quickly do that so maybe"
2700880,2710320," i'm going to do something like uh let uh layout equal to self layouts last and i need to expect"
2714960,2724000," um can't uh can't um create uh a light layout outside"
2724000,2732400," of um ui begin and ui and"
2739680,2746000," uh hi what do you recommend for a 10 years old programming arduino and 3d printing humanoid robot"
2746000,2754880," appreciate your privilege because when i was 10 year old i didn't have a computer"
2754880,2767120," and certainly i didn't have arduino and 3d printing things uh and to be fair i still cannot afford arduino and"
2767120,2772480," 3d printer so the only thing i can suggest for a 10 year old programming or doing it in 3d printing"
2772480,2780240," appreciate your privilege so you're extremely extremely lucky and i'm super happy for you"
2780960,2787120," and good luck with your endeavors um"
2787120,2795920," uh hey toting how do you rename a function in a project globally using emacs and not having lsp enable"
2795920,2802400," uh i just change its name uh and let the compiler tell me where i need to change the the name of the"
2802400,2809120," function and i just go to all these places and change it it actually works without emacs you can do the the same thing in vim"
2809120,2816320," vim you can do the same thing in sublime you can do the same thing in vs code you can do the same thing"
2816320,2824960," in ed in the standard text editor uh this approach works in any text editor at any point of the human"
2824960,2832240," history so this approach will likely to work in 30 years when your favorite text editor is not supported"
2832240,2842240," anymore error doesn't even exist so so that that's what i use i used i use approaches that last forever"
2842960,2846080," anyways please pause that on programming circle track"
2846080,2850160," uh cheers by the way"
2850160,2861680," so let's continue"
2861680,2870160," um how do you rename it in js uh you just don't use js i guess that's the easiest way to do that"
2870800,2877200," um what if we don't have statically compiled languages anymore in 30 years"
2877200,2883600," in 30 years they're going to be 60 so hopefully by then i'm not going to be programming anymore so that"
2883600,2894240," that's my uh that's my hope right that's that's at least my hope um all right so here's the layout uh and"
2894240,2901280," let me see it's going to be layout i need to grab the available position uh and it's going to be something"
2901280,2910960," like that it's going to pose uh and there we go so after that i need to do self uh layout push"
2910960,2913840," layout like this"
2916000,2921520," i might as well actually do something like this find uh position"
2921520,2935600," uh so in the size initial size i think is going to be uh back to new i'm pretty sure i have like a"
2935600,2941360," constructor for layout that basically sets size to zero zero right so maybe i don't need to do this kind"
2941360,2947360," of stuff but it is what it is uh it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't"
2947360,2950160," i'm sorry"
2950160,2952800," so layouts"
2952800,2957360," available pose okay"
2961920,2967600," so and then it's gonna be set layouts pop uh and there we go"
2967600,2977200," i guess that's it right so is it possible for a pop to tell me that i'm doing something wrong"
2977200,2980240," exactly"
2980240,2982960," uh"
2982960,2985520," can pop tell me"
2985520,2991280," that oh okay it can actually it can tell me that you did"
2991280,2996480," if you can do something i expect"
2996480,2997280," uh"
2997280,2999280," can't"
2999280,3003680," i don't know"
3003680,3006000," lay out"
3006000,3013120," stack underflow that's basically what happened in here right layout stack underflow it's the most"
3013120,3016960," useless error message that you can give to the user"
3018080,3022000," layout stack underflow um so"
3022000,3033840," maybe i can give it something like better like unbalanced uh ui begin lay"
3035440,3041600," layout and ui end ui end"
3041600,3044640," layout calls"
3044640,3050800," a little bit better i think i think now it's a little bit better"
3050800,3057840," okay so do you compile do you still compile so we have vert uh which is never constructed we have any"
3057840,3067440," other to do this i think we're done with to do that's pretty cool i think uh so let's"
3067440,3074320," try to use this entire shot uh interestingly enough because we introduced layouts i think we"
3074320,3083120," don't really need such thing as begin list and end list and list elements because this can be replaced by the layouts i think"
3084080,3089840," so let me see so we have begin uh list and we also keep track of the id and"
3089840,3095760," uh yeah you don't need any of this like uh ui is literally just just that"
3096400,3103920," uh right so begin list we don't need that uh and yeah"
3103920,3112960," so list element and when you're doing list element uh you're just doing the label right"
3112960,3121360," yeah you're just fucking doing the label so that's it you don't need any oh my god i can simplify this"
3121360,3131680," and i almost forgot that by the end you should pop out the uh the thing right you should pop out the thing"
3131680,3143920," so and uh let's let's do it like this unbalance ui uh begin and calls right that's basically what's"
3143920,3149440," going on in here all righty all righty all righty all righty riley riley riley"
3149440,3158560," so now uh i begin layout right so when we'll be doing here"
3158560,3168320," wait a second by default begin starts the horizontal one right so i think it starts the horizontal one"
3169440,3173040," uh i think it should start vertical one so this is going to be the default thing"
3173040,3181520," um i think it should start the vertical one that way uh i don't even need any of this stuff so i can"
3181520,3185600," have ui element uh so this one is going to be label um"
3190240,3201120," label here is the format and the index is essentially if index is equal to to do current right i'm using"
3201120,3211840," the highlighted uh pair otherwise i'm using a regular pair uh there we go so that's the thing uh and after"
3211840,3216640," that let me see let me see not need it not need it"
3216640,3229680," if index equal done current uh high light high lighted player"
3229680,3240000," else uh regular player there we go what's up your support how are we doing welcome welcome welcome to the stream"
3241840,3244640," let's see"
3244640,3258320," so and lay out uh this stuff is unused which is kind of strange uh oh yeah that's kind of cool"
3258320,3266560," right so nothing is literally used in here uh what does it do hello hello um"
3267920,3274960," okay so i introduced the layouting system but i didn't like change the functionality of the application"
3274960,3283120," so uh we need to see if uh this entire thing still works as it used to work right and it doesn't i'm"
3283120,3294080," super happy so self layout is empty um okay so it actually asserted uh i expect it to be empty i rather"
3294080,3299840," expect it to be empty yes that's one of the things i want to do oh by the way speaking uh speaking of uh"
3299840,3305360," on the previous stream uh somebody said like that the developing encourages application is hard because"
3305360,3312560," they always mess up your terminal right look my terminal is completely messed up and what i suggested"
3312560,3317440," that if you get into this state blindly type reset i'm blinding tap and reset"
3319440,3323760," and my terminal is back you don't need to restart anything you don't need to do anything"
3323760,3330400," if you cannot see what is going on just blindly type reset it will probably work i never encountered"
3330400,3338800," a situation when my terminal is so bad that i cannot even uh you know uh blindly type reset so yeah here's the"
3338800,3351120," the trick for you you're welcome five bucks i'm joking"
3358640,3369680," okay let's let's give it a try so i think i already fixed everything right so i fixed the"
3369680,3376160," logic in assert and i'm gonna do cargo run and uh okay so i have to specify the file"
3376160,3383920," and it still works and i can still tap between the tabs uh and then i can press enter and it's yeah"
3383920,3390880," it still works as it's supposed to work yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes you cover a desu um all"
3390880,3398560," right so and that's how much code it took to introduce layouting but now why the hell did we"
3398560,3404480," introduce all of that why the hell did we introduce all of that well we introduced all of that so it is"
3404480,3412800," possible to actually take these two tabs right and render them alongside so first one tab and then the"
3412800,3420640," the next one that's what we're trying to do how can we do that well um so this entire thing starts"
3420640,3425840," vertically you know sometimes i want to start vertically sometimes i want to start horizontally"
3425840,3433520," so maybe i'm going to actually update uh all right uh this thing to accept the kind as well so it's going"
3433520,3439120," be con kind uh layout kind all right and it's going to be something like this there we go"
3439120,3446240," so let's go to the completionaries i could duke did i say hi to you i don't remember but hello anyway"
3446240,3454560," uh layout uh layouts kind uh let's count and this one has to be horizontal right so we're starting"
3454560,3462960," horizontally uh and now regardless of the tab regardless of the tab uh we're gonna render both"
3462960,3469920," of these things i'm gonna render both of this thing a good thing okay"
3469920,3480480," uh so and we're gonna remove this kind of stuff i'm not sure"
3482640,3488240," you know i'm gonna actually have it like this all right so it's gonna be to do then this one is gonna"
3488240,3498160," be done"
3498160,3507920," hello john"
3507920,3510560," hello"
3513760,3521520," yes so you see we start the uh root horizontal layout this is a root horizontal layout now we're"
3521520,3529040," gonna have a layout for the left panel right ui uh begin layout um"
3529040,3534400," oh this song actually rocks i love it"
3539280,3545840," this style of sucks sounds like uh something from too many zoos you know you guys know what i'm talking"
3545840,3546080," about"
3546080,3552480," it's like literally this is how too many zoos sounds like it sounds like"
3552480,3556240," too many zoos i think this is how we spell it i forgot"
3556240,3562560," uh yeah uh really recommend to check out this band so"
3564800,3569600," it actually sounds like them all right so um"
3569600,3579600," layout kind uh and this one is gonna be something like it has to be vertical one right so this is the"
3579600,3580240," vertical one"
3585200,3586800," you know what else is blood"
3586800,3592240," i'm sorry let's continue"
3592240,3600720," so this is the vertical one and uh another one"
3600720,3603840," uh we can lay out"
3603840,3613200," layout kind"
3613200,3618400," so this is basically what i want to have in here right"
3618400,3622480," might as well put like uh colons in here"
3622480,3629680," layout kind"
3629680,3640240," all righty so the moment of truth the moment of truth um it's not really the moment of truth so right"
3640240,3641520," now we have a weird logic"
3641520,3649440," that uh yeah so we need to separate this kind of stuff so if the current tab"
3649440,3656800," is to do this thing has to be highlighted if not that thing needs to be highlighted okay so"
3656800,3663120," we're highlighting only if the index is equal to that and tab is equal to status to do"
3664000,3669360," only then we're highlighting this entire stuff only then and then here we're highlighting this entire"
3669360,3677440," stuff uh if the index actually fits and the tab is equal to status uh done i think right"
3677440,3685120," so that way we'll have to like i have a simple focus system that focuses between the tabs between the"
3685120,3691760," the panels depending on the panels depending on yeah when you press tab okay so let me see if it's gonna"
3691760,3699600," work or not and of course status apparently is not comparable uh oh i'm sorry"
3699600,3706800," thank you and anonymous uh for gifting eight uh tier one subs thank you thank you thank you and"
3706800,3716160," everyone who got this up welcome to our epic uh thrust club okay so why can't i compare tab uh is that"
3716160,3722720," because status to do is not comparable that's probably why so does it say that uh yeah i need to partial"
3722720,3733920," equality uh rust people are fighting the partial okay whatever uh partial equality all right"
3733920,3750000," does not apply to status uh oh i'm an idiot okay so it has to be status"
3751200,3753440," yeah partial equality"
3753440,3769280," it's kind of cold in here uh where the novosibirsk uh oh the boat is dead so does anyone know the the"
3769280,3776000," weather in novosibirsk please tell me the internet knows uh novosibirsk oh i actually don't"
3776000,3787280," want to google this kind of right now uh in this setup uh novosibirsk uh uh plus 16"
3787280,3796880," should be fine yeah plus 16 okay so it's um it's all right it's getting actually warmer so"
3797920,3807360," uh it's getting warmer okay um surprisingly enough like we don't have ids we don't really keep track of"
3807360,3814480," the ids uh and we never use this new thingy so maybe i never gonna actually provide it in here"
3815760,3821360," get warm get warm yeah"
3821360,3832960," uh okay so now the moment of truth when i start the uh the application we should have two panels"
3832960,3838960," right left panels with to do's and the right panels with dunce they might be scuffed okay they might be scuffed"
3838960,3846000," okay they might be scuffed but they should be very distinct like right it should be visible that"
3846000,3851440," you know they are two panels okay let's give it a try oh yeah of course i need to prepare to do"
3852080,3856480," uh and nope it didn't work"
3856480,3866000," hmm interesting very interesting let's try to to bullshit that"
3866000,3873920," uh north first i'm sorry i'm apparently i'm not a god cooler um"
3877920,3880160," so here is the position"
3880160,3896000," oh i see so x is that x is that then height is one uh that is correct then we use y and x like this"
3896000,3898800," and then we have an available position"
3903600,3907200," so maybe there's something wrong with these functions right um"
3907200,3914240," so multiplication x y and then sum"
3914240,3918720," gives that"
3918720,3929120," uh horizontal plus x but y is going to be mean that uh maximum between that and plus y i don't see any"
3929120,3940160," problems in here oh i know yeah i i just remembered uh layout is as much of a widget as anything else"
3940160,3947440," right so when you pop out the layout you need to tell the previous layout its size so it can extend"
3947440,3952400," and expand i completely forgot about this part okay so let's actually do that um"
3954560,3959680," all right uh so we pop uh this thing out um"
3959680,3970720," so and this thing should return the element all right so it should return the layout uh layout uh cool"
3970720,3979600," and then what i need to do self layout uh lust which is mutable uh and yet again i probably want to"
3980560,3990720," expand on this thing right i want to expand on this thing uh and what i do i just uh push widget right"
3990720,3997600," or maybe add widget add widget and i take the size of that uh previous layout and just push it down"
3998640,4011120," so yep yep yep yep yep and let's read it uh layout sit there's several of them"
4011120,4015520," okay so"
4024240,4029200," and as you can see it's a little bit scuffed because it actually takes the maximum right"
4029200,4035920," so this is the biggest line right and because of that this thing becomes shorter and as you can see"
4035920,4041440," like yeah it's kind of weird but uh overall it works uh i can actually tap between them"
4041440,4043920," i press stop and i actually tap between them"
4046400,4054800," so isn't it cool i think it's pretty cool what guys think uh yeah so then we can uh quit and stuff like"
4054800,4055920," that so"
4055920,4066400," so it's a little bit more complicated than it was before uh because uh right yeah scuffed org mode yeah"
4066400,4076240," precisely um scuffed org mode uh so i think now we're gonna actually try to refine this entire stuff"
4076400,4084160," and make it look a little bit better um so what did we're doing here is we basically implemented two"
4084160,4090080," panels do i have what to do for the yeah here we go so here's two panels and i need to create like this"
4090080,4102160," thing uh all right uh implement uh implement the two panel ui there we go and i'm gonna push that right"
4102160,4110480," it to the repo we don't really have a ci um but i feel like we should have it right at least we should"
4110480,4119200," test uh different stuff oh yeah so uh we also need to test formatting and whatnot all right so how do you"
4119200,4126960," how do you format is it cargo fmt i don't remember i think it's a cargo fmt oh yeah would you look at that"
4127600,4138480," huh uh all right okay so i should periodically actually format everything uh nine uh apply"
4138480,4146080," cargo fmt right and i remember there was also clippy is clippy still a thing that you're supposed to use"
4146080,4152800," in 2021 i i know that a rust community moves fast and uh constantly changes their tooling and stuff like"
4152800,4159440," that is clippy still a thing or am i supposed to use in something else uh uh so i'm gonna just use clippy"
4159440,4171440," so there's a couple of problems in here and okay uh remove return oh this is actually very interesting"
4173280,4185840," oh yeah so i can just just do it like that um manual strip uh strip prefix manually"
4192800,4203120," okay okay prefix was tested here well yeah um try to use strip prefix"
4203120,4210320," no no no no no this is precisely what i want to do actually so if it"
4210320,4218960," so let me see i'm not sure if strip prefix will tell me that it couldn't strip the prefix i think"
4218960,4223920," strip prefix basically doesn't give me enough information to to implement what i want that's"
4223920,4227440," the problem here uh so"
4227440,4241840," all right so maybe it does return the string slice with the prefix removed if the string starts with the"
4241840,4250000," pattern prefix uh wrapped in some unlike trim uh okay this is actually quite convenient"
4250000,4258000," so all right so maybe i'm gonna use this function strip prefix uh and if prefix doesn't exist"
4258000,4263760," uh perfect okay so maybe that's precisely what we can use in here"
4268800,4279760," so strip prefix so this is the to do prefix uh and"
4279760,4294560," maybe i can map this entire stuff right so this thing returns the like maybe uh and we can map it uh and"
4296400,4299840," this is the title so this is the title so that means here i need to return status"
4299840,4305680," uh to do and the title that's what i wanted to return in here"
4305680,4309520," but if it failed"
4309520,4317760," i guess you can go full on functional programming in here"
4321120,4330240," we can try to do that we can try to do that or else or something right so uh or else yeah and in that or else"
4330240,4341840," so just accept a function that doesn't do anything special in here uh we try to use the same strip uh prefix"
4350240,4356400," monads yeah yeah basically we're starting to write a very monadic code uh this is a very monadic code"
4356400,4360960," strip prefix uh done prefix right um"
4360960,4379120," i have an idea actually um we could have like something like two items in here right to do item uh to do item"
4379120,4390640," which is essentially line uh strip prefix to do right and then all of that mapped with uh title"
4390640,4398240," status to do title so here's the first item then um"
4398240,4405280," we can have done prefix done item right"
4407120,4408400," uh"
4408400,4412800," uh"
4412800,4418080," and this one is going to be something like this and there is like a little bit of repetition in here"
4418080,4420720," uh and essentially i think you can remove"
4420720,4424080," this entire thing by doing something like to do"
4424080,4432000," uh item or done item which is actually quite cool right so you part try to parse an item it's either to"
4432000,4443120," to do item or uh done item so yeah it's pretty much it's so it should work hopefully so very very"
4443120,4447920," functionalish very functionalish i would say uh let me rebuild this entire stuff"
4449280,4456960," um okay that's it even builds all right isn't that cool isn't it cool i really like that so yeah"
4461360,4466640," so what what what else do we have here uh clipping"
4466640,4472480," clipping so this could be just uh okay this could be just this"
4477760,4482240," too is cleaner is cleaner um okay is empty okay"
4482240,4490800," this looks nice you know it i have years of haskell"
4492720,4495200," i know how to write this code this kind of code"
4495200,4499840," all right seems good"
4510320,4516640," so and then if i try to build this into anything seems to be working as well i really want to run"
4516640,4523840," fmt and clippy um in clippy on ci okay so it seems to be working"
4523840,4531680," huh it's really strange we have underflow and what the"
4533520,4536000," when did we introduce that i can't believe that"
4536000,4545200," apparently we have underflows and overflows and yeah"
4545200,4552000," they shouldn't happen um especially when we do transfers and stuff right so"
4552000,4555680," after the transfer we actually check everything and apply everything"
4557280,4566160," uh this is empty maybe um i already lost the place where it was"
4566160,4582240," so let's go through all of the places where i have is empty"
4587280,4601120," so i think uh i'm gonna go to the this stuff at least transfer uh-huh all right so let me see"
4609040,4622960," what do we have is not empty not empty okay i probably forgot not empty"
4622960,4634960," using not empty is clearer and more explicit okay so sure"
4638400,4641280," so that should be working now wait what"
4641280,4648320," come on you can do that uh all right so that seems to be working"
4648320,4654320," so we have two panels and shits isn't that cool i think it's pretty cool"
4654320,4661040," um you know when you ran out of elements on one of the panels it becomes unclear"
4661040,4666160," on what panel you are right so maybe we're gonna actually do the following thing"
4666720,4677120," so we're gonna indicate what panel you're at uh so essentially if uh tab is currently status"
4677120,4683600," to do uh we're gonna be rendering this entire thing as uh to do right"
4683600,4687280," otherwise we're gonna be rendering it with spaces"
4688880,4697680," uh-huh so similarly uh we're gonna do the same thing for done right for done in here"
4697680,4710720," so done and let me let me see yeah there we go oh oh okay so it has to be done here"
4712160,4722240," uh so as you can see yeah we have a focus in here so that's actually pretty cool look at that i like that"
4722240,4731600," maybe we can make it even cooler if we actually highlight with special color"
4732320,4739840," um what about special color color instead of like this stuff um it could be something like to do"
4739840,4745600," just a to do but the condition is going to be like this"
4745600,4755920," uh if this we are using the highlight pair uh highlight there"
4757440,4762800," otherwise regular one and the same goes to uh here"
4762800,4766720," done"
4766720,4768320," done"
4768320,4777520," yeah and if you get rid of all of them you still yeah you still have highlighting in here but then"
4777520,4782320," it's a switch and you're in here here i don't know which one is better to be fair i'm gonna leave it"
4782320,4787600," with this one i think it's all right uh i think it is all right more or less"
4787600,4795920," focus system about that uh all right so i'm gonna try to"
4795920,4804240," run clippy one more time okay and fmt one more time uh-huh and"
4809200,4814560," fix uh clippy remarks i'm gonna push that right into the reaper"
4814560,4836160," so the next thing i want to do i would like to set up ci uh for for the for the rust right so let's"
4836160,4842160," see how we can do that maybe i can steal some stuff from my previous uh previous west projects"
4842160,4848560," have you ever done coding in unreal engine 4 i don't have money to buy unreal engine license i'm sorry"
4848560,4851760," that's why i write all of my engines from scratch"
4859200,4863040," so this one this one is going to be workflows uh and"
4863040,4875520," okay and this one is ci yaml right"
4884320,4892400," so rust project so we also install some in here um okay i can pretty much quick base this into i"
4892400,4895440," think i think uh we don't even run tests in here"
4895440,4907360," and uh let me see so we also have tests i don't think we need uh we need tests right now yeah past zero"
4907360,4912480," but also zero failed uh but i'm gonna keep it in there in case we're gonna start like having tests"
4912480,4920720," and whatnot so uh and i'm gonna actually copy paste this into i think in here uh boom"
4925280,4931200," nine try to set up ci and i'm gonna push that right into the repo"
4931200,4936720," and let's create a pull request"
4936720,4950000," implement the two panel ui to be fair i would like to also clean up the entire thing if you know what i mean"
4950000,4957440," because i don't like that the ui jumps around right uh so let me show you like we have a longest thing"
4957440,4963360," in here and as you can see it jumps around and it's it's not really great to look in my opinion"
4963360,4971120," so one of the things we can try to do is uh actually keep the sizes of the panels consistent"
4971120,4974080," if you know what i mean uh and to do that"
4976160,4984480," we need to fixate fixate the size of the um of the single element so and the single element right now"
4984480,4992960," is basically a label right so if i go to main uh dot rs so this is going to be a label uh and this is"
4992960,5002720," where we can try to specify this size so and i'm thinking i want to also have an option to basically use"
5002720,5006160," whatever the size of the text all right"
5006160,5012480," so we can um"
5012480,5017360," yeah we can try to introduce something like enumeration"
5017360,5026720," come on come on enumeration uh label width right and because of that is going to be"
5030720,5039520," text len all right or fixed where you provide i32 right so"
5039520,5046640," yeah essentially you have label width and you can say text length uh if you don't care"
5046640,5051360," right if you do care you want to fixate it you say it's precisely that um"
5055280,5062480," you can always accept the size and force the user to provide it but i'm not sure um i have a bad idea"
5062480,5068480," by the way i have a bad idea that doesn't require introducing new types let's literally have"
5068480,5078400," uh label fixed uh size right that way you don't have to have types or anything and you still have a very"
5078400,5088240," very convenient label uh right you fixed width uh self text uh str"
5088240,5102560," player uh i16 and you also can provide the width which is i uh 32. what's interesting is that we can move"
5102560,5110640," the implementation of this thing in here right and implement the label in terms of the label fixed width"
5110640,5119280," label fixed width uh but uh the width is basically is the length of the text like this so"
5119280,5129920," um all right so because uh russ doesn't have uh the default arguments so we have to do this kind of stuff"
5130720,5135600," i really want to have a language by the way i really want to have a language that would allow me to do"
5135600,5146480," the following thing um something like um let's reorder these things a little bit text and width and refer"
5146480,5154560," back to previous arguments i want to able to have a language that allows me to do this kind of stuff"
5155360,5161280," unfortunately i don't know a single language that allows me to do these things uh that would be super"
5161280,5164080," convenient so"
5164080,5177600," there's probably arguments for not doing that because uh then the maybe evaluation of the arguments"
5177600,5182880," matters uh and because of that you lose pretty cool optimizations and stuff like that but i mean"
5184320,5191120," computers are fast so taking notes for bank yeah i have a lot of ideas in terms of like"
5191120,5195120," uh default arguments in bank and also variadic arguments as well"
5195120,5207200," so we're definitely going to have uh variadic arguments in bank and they're going to be actually"
5207200,5229040," type save statically typed right okay uh so we provide this thing uh layout uh we take the position we put it"
5229040,5235200," in here uh in here uh and the width that we're using we're literally using this width"
5235200,5246000," have you tried wx widgets if so what do you think i actually have but that was a long time ago"
5246000,5256320," uh i tried them when i was in high school and it was really long time ago and my impression about wx is that it's a"
5257040,5261840," uh open source mfc does anyone remember what the f is mfc uh"
5261840,5271760," uh cool nobody remember yeah so uh microsoft foundation class library does it does anyone remember this"
5271760,5281840," piece of like holy uh yeah yeah yeah so here's okay you also remember uh so my impression on wx widgets was"
5281840,5285600," it's basically open source mfc so that's my impression"
5285600,5288640," uh"
5288640,5295280," but this is what i remember from a long time ago i haven't tried wx widgets uh in ages maybe they're"
5295280,5300080," different now but at the time yeah it's it's open source mfc um so"
5303200,5305920," uh this makes sense uh right"
5305920,5317120," all righty all righty okay so i'm cleaning up uh let me see let me see so i'm gonna do build"
5322160,5328000," it doesn't build doesn't flipping build as i32 all right"
5328000,5336640," um okay good and if i try to run this entire thing okay so that didn't change anything that's fine"
5336640,5338160," because we never use that thing"
5341600,5344800," um"
5344800,5345040," all right"
5345040,5360000," label fixed width and the width is gonna be i think it has to be half of the width of the window"
5361360,5372480," um and curses window size why is the length signed integer because the position is also signed integer"
5372480,5379600," so uh that way because we are using them uh in mathematical operations with uh signed ones and"
5379600,5381600," just makes it overall easier"
5381600,5392160," it's like in games right in games you work with floats right and float may also mean a position"
5392160,5400480," in something x or y position right so x or y and it also means size and there's also x and y position"
5400480,5406400," right and as you can see flow is signed and you don't have any opportunity to make it unsigned and"
5406400,5410880," it doesn't even matter since you're using all that in mathematical computations so it's the same"
5410880,5416880," situation but with integers you know what i'm talking about um"
5416880,5428480," terminal size uh okay that's i guess what i'm doing here"
5429760,5435360," uh so we're gonna be taking the size of the window on each frame i suppose"
5435360,5438720," uh you're welcome"
5438720,5453760," this signature is incorrect by the way it has to accept y and x by pointer i think yeah"
5456960,5462240," excuse me excuse me the the this signature is also incorrect"
5462240,5467760," who's who's wrong who's right how does it work then uh"
5467760,5478000," oh oh it's probably a macro it's it's probably goddamn macro yeah yeah okay so yeah"
5478000,5483200," but in in rust it's probably not gonna be a macro so um"
5485520,5490880," let mutable x y and you can even do it like that maybe not"
5490880,5495280," both of these things and uh"
5495280,5498160," there we go"
5498160,5513440," yeah it is extremely confusing look and to be fair why what's the point of making it a macro like come on"
5514080,5520800," uh i mean i know that people use macros for backward compatibility and like wrap functions and stuff"
5520800,5525120," like that but again you don't have to make it confusing let's just make a macro that accepts a"
5525120,5530560," pointer like it's just like there's no literally no reason for making it confusing like that just"
5530560,5531520," literally no reason"
5535920,5536240," okay okay"
5536240,5544480," okay uh this function takes two arguments all right so yeah now i need half of the width and essentially"
5563120,5566000," all right"
5566000,5575840," so is it gonna work local variable okay so it has to be x then"
5575840,5584560," um"
5584560,5593680," fixed width all right so it's a fixed width and this is a fixed width and we're using precisely half of the"
5593680,5600640," width of the window that's what we're doing in here uh all right so now if you take a look at this stuff"
5600640,5610160," uh now everything's fixed and furthermore uh it actually resizes properly right so now it looks way"
5610160,5612240," better than it was before uh"
5612240,5621520," right oh okay so i suppose we need to use fixed width on to do and uh down as well yeah yeah we need"
5621520,5634800," to do that uh label uh fixed width and has to be x2 uh done fixed width uh x"
5641680,5648880," so this label is never used apparently uh let's actually allow uh that code"
5648880,5651600," code this"
5651600,5663920," mm-hmm all right so okay so now it works uh all right cool oh my god this looks way better uh and feels also"
5663920,5673840," way better uh nice nice nice nice nice nice nice and i also like the simplicity of the entire thing uh"
5673840,5682160," right excluding the third party dependencies which is only one uh and curses the entire thing is 350 lines of code"
5684400,5688800," right so and we're not using anything on top of incurses everything is our own thing"
5688800,5695760," um i'm using incurses i think i already mentioned that i'm using incurses and that's it"
5708400,5717920," okay cool uh so do we need to update the readme uh for this kind of thing uh switch between uh panels"
5717920,5726080," uh perform the action on the ui on on the highlighted coming coffee what's up"
5726080,5732320," what's up here you're doing very good to see you hello hello hello cheers"
5738400,5748800," all right it looks good to me and i think we don't have tabs anymore uh i think we need to rename"
5748800,5756000," them to panels right so panel is gonna do that uh maybe i can also query replace tab with panel and tap"
5756640,5767920," tap tap tap tap there we go uh as you said so i'm chilling okay let's chill together um"
5767920,5774640," surprisingly this didn't work properly but yeah panel panel"
5774640,5783840," it's kind of strange that it didn't fully replace everything but okay"
5785840,5795120," uh"
5795120,5802400," so what did we do here um"
5802400,5813200," fix the size of the panels right so and"
5815840,5822000," update read me the documentation right and let's do the usual thing fmt"
5822000,5823120," uh-huh"
5823120,5824560," uh-huh okay"
5824560,5832400," nine fix fmt remarks and let's listen to the clippy remarks uh how about some clipper remarks"
5832400,5837120," uh no clippy remarks everything is perfect would you look at that um"
5837120,5842720," um and the most important thing the most important thing look look check look look uh"
5846400,5852720," uh where's the point where's my thing where's my thing not a single unsafe keyword in the entire file"
5852720,5860720," so yeah it is absolutely safe you can use it on your computer and no harm will be done"
5860720,5870000," trust me um it is absolutely safe uh compiling not complaining you know it"
5870000,5879280," know it if it compiles chat tell them tell me new people in the chat tell them if it compiles it works"
5879280,5882960," ah all right so we're waiting for continuous integration"
5882960,5889040," all right"
5894000,5903680," what's going to be the next thing um"
5903680,5909280," reorder items this one sounds actually very interesting"
5909280,5914640," reorder items i really want to be able to just go here"
5915760,5923280," uh and really just change the order like move uh the current element up or down and i think you"
5923280,5931360," can do that by yeah holding shift yeah does incursus works on with uh there is a special thing for"
5931360,5940880," incursus i think uh but you can try to run it in wsl um right so um we have a confirmation that this"
5940880,5944880," application works on windows under wsl and let's be honest"
5944880,5952880," there is no point in supporting windows in 2021 anyway because windows is slowly moving towards"
5952880,5959840," just yet another linux distro anyway so just write your applications for linux it's gonna work"
5959840,5964640," eventually on windows as microsoft ditches this entire project into oblivion and we're only gonna"
5964640,5969680," have linux on the desktop know what i'm talking about so don't even worry about that so"
5969680,5977120," linux is already shipped with the linux kernel it's already technically a linux distro it just requires"
5977120,5984720," a little bit more steps to become a proper linux distro so come on like why why bother why bother"
5984720,5997680," cheers by the way finally the year of linux on desktop"
5999680,6003760," okay so um all right"
6003760,6011520," uh i guess everything's fine okay so we're ready to merge this kind of stuff"
6011520,6017600," year of playing then that's the when i don't know i still want to try plan nine um"
6022160,6025920," so you haven't tried it sounds like a pretty sounds like a pretty cool meme"
6025920,6031360," pretty cool meme so let's implement reorder elements"
6031360,6039760," to be fair before we uh reorder elements i would like to make a cup of tea and make a god damn it my"
6039760,6047200," god rdb 42 thank you so much for uh 501 subs thank you thank you thank you and welcome"
6047200,6055120," everyone to our epic uh rust club so uh okay and on that positive note i'm gonna go and make a break"
6055120,6063760," thank you everyone for money i i gotta go i gotta go thank you thank you so much so uh yep uh let's do uh"
6063760,6071920," um all right let's continue let's continue so what we want to be able to do we want to be able to reorder"
6071920,6077920," uh all of these elements right so how i want to do that i want to be able to do that by holding shift"
6079040,6092320," uh by holding shift let me see um so you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna actually append the keys uh to"
6092320,6099760," my to-do list just to lock them uh all right so this is actually a pretty cool idea look uh it is it doesn't"
6099760,6108080," work but here's the thing uh if i press other things uh they get appended in here right uh i suppose that"
6108080,6113280," means that they're going to be actually saved automatically in a to-do in here yeah they're"
6113280,6119520," actually automatically saved okay that's that's fine uh all right and now if i try to press shift s"
6119520,6128240," oh that is actually very interesting so i suppose it is literally equal to"
6128240,6137440," uh to capitalized s and w i think we can actually do something about that i think we can um so"
6138000,6146160," uh let's give it a try uh let's give it a try this can be w uh and actually big w uh match panel"
6146160,6149440," right so maybe we'll need to introduce a special function that basically"
6149440,6154240," that lets you drag uh elements around"
6158960,6172160," uh if the status is to do uh list drag up uh and i suppose we'll have to provide mutable uh the list"
6172160,6180800," right and also mutable cursor right so because that will uh modify both the list and the cursor right"
6180800,6191600," and in case of done uh we'll have to do dance down current uh okay so uh let's do least drug up uh and"
6191600,6207840," let's find where we can put the implementation um okay this um list uh mutable slice i wonder if mutable slice"
6207840,6216320," is gonna be actually enough right mutable slice because dragging things around is not going to"
6216320,6224800," uh remove or extend so it's basically gonna only swap the elements and i wonder if a slice"
6224800,6234640," has a method for swapping elements uh okay so the rust std uh std docs or something so let me let me see let me see"
6234640,6245280," let me see so slice do you have anything for swap it's a module slice god damn it"
6245280,6249440," primitive i want to care about the primitive"
6249440,6259040," so if it has swap it should start with s uh there we go"
6260960,6265760," perfect so i can just provide two indices and it will swap elements inside with slice"
6265760,6272720," and slice has to be mutable that's precisely what i want uh so and in here we have a least current"
6272720,6275120," and it's going to be just size"
6275120,6278640," drug up"
6282160,6293440," essentially if uh list current is greater than zero only then we can try to do that so and that's"
6293440,6303600," essentially missed list uh swap uh least current with least current uh minus one and then least current"
6303600,6311920," and then the element itself uh becomes uh less uh by one so that's basically what we do to drag an element"
6311920,6318560," up uh so let's see if this entire thing compiles well this is not how we compile so let's actually do build"
6318560,6325280," uh but it's still not gonna help us anyway um so we have to do something like this"
6325280,6337040," uh come on uh huh and let's see uh now look i'm gonna press uh shift w and i can move it around"
6337040,6344880," so i can now go here and i can drag it up so and i need to now um"
6346800,6352240," uh implement the same thing for dragging down uh right so let's quickly implement uh"
6352240,6359040," a fan list drag down uh is gonna accept the immutable slice"
6359040,6370240," uh list current and mutable use size uh and essentially we're only gonna do that if the list"
6370240,6382160," index is uh maybe even plus one is less than list length right uh so you have two options by the way"
6382160,6389280," you can either check index plus one less than len or the index less than minus one who knows why"
6389280,6392160," minus one is not preferable in this particular situation"
6400240,6414400," because it's u size and u size is unsigned so if it's equal to zero it's going to underflow"
6414400,6423200," so this one is never underflows but it can overflow theoretically but uh in that case u size has to be"
6423200,6430160," extremely big uh so the likelihood of this overflowing is actually less than the likelihood of"
6430160,6436800," this underflowing because this underflowing is literally like the usual case right so yeah"
6436800,6444720," so this can also have problems uh but this uh this one uh less likely to cause any problems so"
6444720,6452240," the only way for a user to hit this case is to actually append shed ton of elements that will"
6452240,6459280," overflow your size and to overflow your size uh so your size is 64 bits so and the amount of like the number"
6459280,6467280," that it can hold is literally uh this right so the user has to include uh this amount of elements"
6467280,6469440," would it compile it would"
6469440,6480880," uh minus would compile as far as maybe in the rust it won't compile but i remember in rust having problems"
6480880,6485760," because because yeah yeah it actually compiled it actually compiled fine um"
6485760,6490960," but it will fail at runtime"
6490960,6495040," it will fail at runtime"
6498400,6509840," um all right so and in here uh what we're doing we'll do list swap uh list current uh list current uh list current plus one uh so"
6509840,6531520," i don't know just brain farted for a second uh and in here we're going to be doing a very similar thing so we're waiting for s uh match panel"
6531520,6544240," status to do"
6544240,6549120," this drug um down"
6551120,6554960," to this uh to do current"
6554960,6562640," dance done"
6562640,6575920," all right so that means that now i can do the following thing i can just drag it around"
6577200,6581120," what's interesting is that it works on both of these elements right"
6581120,6583920," so yep"
6583920,6586880," is that cool i think it's pretty cool"
6586880,6589120," uh actually"
6589120,6593200," uh i also want to be able to move"
6593200,6594880," um"
6596080,6597040," to the end"
6597040,6598880," to the end and uh the beginning of the list"
6598880,6605760," so"
6605760,6608800," so where is my to do"
6608800,6615600," jump to the end"
6615600,6618720," and beginning of the"
6618720,6620000," lists"
6620000,6620800," right"
6622560,6625280," so that's another thing that we want to be able to do"
6625280,6626800," and"
6626800,6628400," yeah"
6628400,6629600," so let's bring it back"
6629600,6632960," and now i can just move all of that in here"
6632960,6635440," right and eventually"
6635440,6638240," eventually we should be able to delete those elements"
6638240,6639440," i think"
6639440,6646240," deleting the elements should be only allowed in done right first you need to move to done and then you'll be able to"
6646240,6647280," to delete it"
6650560,6656320," another cool thing is that the list remembers its uh its index as you can see right so i can"
6656320,6661200," move around in here and then it remembers it so yep it's pretty cool"
6661200,6665200," also i think i'm gonna remove this stuff"
6665200,6672240," all righty so i might as well remove this stuff um"
6672240,6680080," wait am i still in that branch uh i think i am still in that branch so i actually have to"
6680560,6680960," do this stuff"
6680960,6684480," so let's go to the main and there we go"
6684480,6690960," origin master it's not really master it's main"
6690960,6695840," so it's kind of interesting i think i created a project with cargo in it"
6695840,6701120," and cargo in it automatically initializes the git repo for you and i think by default it uses main"
6703040,6704640," um all right uh"
6704640,6706960," all right uh which is cool"
6706960,6708560," um"
6708560,6716480," no no no no no no so we're gonna do something like eight uh all right so it's gonna be eight"
6716480,6719200," let's do that"
6719200,6730720," implement dragging elements around all right and uh in here"
6731520,6733040," we need to also document that"
6733040,6745920," so um i might as well actually copy paste this thing and just say something like shift plus uh w"
6745920,6747360," and shift"
6747360,6750080," plus s"
6752800,6756880," drag the current item up and down"
6756880,6757840," right"
6757840,6768720," all right so seems to be building"
6768720,6778080," document dragging elements around and let's push that right into the return"
6780320,6788720," okay so i think we need to update the uh the thumbnail here as well because now our replication looks"
