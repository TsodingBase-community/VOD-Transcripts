400,6320," Looks like we're live. Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session."
6320,9360," How about that? But you didn't expect that shit to happen."
9360,15280," So let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start the stream."
15280,23520," Red Circle live on Twitch and what are we doing today on twitch.it division website?"
24080,34480," Today we are generating videos with neural networks in C of course."
34480,38800," I'm going to give the link to twitch.tv/setting, the place where we're doing all of that."
38800,41360," And I'm going to ping everyone who's interested in being pinged."
41360,44640," And there we go, the stream has officially started."
44640,45920," There we go."
45920,53520," So today we continue working on nn.h, which is the deep learning framework in C that we've been developing for quite some time already."
53520,56720," I don't know for how long, but it's been quite a few streams, right?"
56720,59600," So you can find the link to this thing here."
59600,61520," I'm going to copy paste it in the chat."
61520,64640," And for people who are watching on YouTube, it's going to be in the description, right?"
64640,71680," So what we're doing essentially, we are exploring a completely new for me paradigm called machine learning."
71680,75760," And we do that by implementing a deep learning framework, right?"
75760,82240," So essentially in the previous streams, we were experimenting with interpolating two images, right?"
82240,85040," So let's actually take a look at the experiments, right?"
85040,86240," So I'm going to start Tmux."
86240,91360," I'm going to go into the folder where we're developing all of that."
91360,91760," All right."
91760,97280," So I'm going to rebuild everything just in case, because I don't quite remember if I did all of that."
97280,100800," So let me bring up the Raylib environment and I'm going to do the build."
100800,107840," While it is building, I'm going to put something behind my camera so I don't see the things you guys don't see."
107840,110560," So we are on the same page, right?"
110560,113200," So that's how I usually do that."
113200,123840," So and I'm going to start the image2nn application, which basically trains a neural network to interpolate between two images."
123840,129520," The thing we have to do is that we have to provide the two images, right?"
129520,133200," So we have a couple of images from NIST dataset, right?"
133200,138480," So we're going to provide the eight and we're going to provide the six, right?"
138480,141520," So these are the digits that we're providing to this entire thing."
141520,142480," And there we go."
142480,145040," Here is this sort of like a gym, right?"
145040,148320," The gym for the neural network to train itself."
148320,151840," This architecture is a little bit too deep for my liking, right?"
151840,153680," So it has like five layers there."
153680,159600," This kind of stuff is kind of difficult to train with the activation function and the method that I use."
159600,163200," So I would like to actually reduce the complexity of this entire neural network."
163200,164160," Just a second."
164160,165360," So let's actually go in here."
165360,166480," Right."
166480,168320," So this is how many layers we have."
168320,175120," We have three input layers and we have five hidden layers and one output layer."
175120,180080," I would like to bring this amount to 2, 11 and 1, 9, right?"
180080,182800," So I remember that this kind of architecture actually worked well."
182800,186720," And let me actually rebuild this entire thing real quick."
186720,194320," So the architecture is sort of baked into the executable, right?"
194320,196560," So that's why I have to rebuild this entire thing."
196560,197280," And there you go."
197280,198880," So it's a little bit simpler."
198880,201120," So it's a little bit easier to actually train."
201120,203120," So and let's actually start the training process."
203120,205280," So basically on the left, you can see this."
205280,211600," This is how it acts as the first image and here it acts as the second one."
211600,211920," All right."
211920,216320," So here I have a slider and the slider basically controls the learning rate."
216320,222160," So here I can manually adjust the learning rate when I see that the neural network goes too crazy."
222160,224480," As you can see here, it just goes a little bit too crazy."
224480,228080," I just like bring the learning rate a little bit down and calm it down a little bit."
228080,232000," So as far as I know, you're supposed to actually do that programmatically, automatically."
232000,237040," But for the learning experience, I decided to actually put it in here in control of the user."
237040,239280," And it's actually kind of convenient, right?"
239280,243840," So to be able in real time to control the learning rate."
243840,248080," So people use different functions to control the neural, like the learning rate."
248080,255680," But what you can do, you can use another neural network to control the rate of learning of the initial neural network."
255680,259280," And you can even use your own neural network to control the learning rate."
261680,262800," This is actually funny, right?"
262800,266240," So using one neural network to control the learning rate of another neural network."
266240,271360," Anyway, so and basically this is how the neural network acts as the first image."
271360,273920," And this is how it acts as the second image."
273920,278080," And how it's supposed to act is controlled by the third neuron, right?"
278080,280720," If you put zero in here, it will act like an eight."
280720,283520," And if you put one in here, it will act like a six."
284080,286640," So how do we achieve the interpolation?"
286640,290560," Essentially, if after training this entire neural network, right?"
290560,292400," So we already train it to its limit."
292400,294320," So it doesn't really go any better than this."
294320,297120," So when we keep training it, it just keeps shaking."
297120,300400," It just tries to adjust some parameters, but it couldn't find anything better."
300400,302960," So it basically solves the problem, right?"
302960,307440," If you put a value that is neither zero nor one or something like half,"
307440,311520," it will start interpolating between these two images, right?"
312400,316960," So this slider is basically the value that goes into this neuron."
316960,319920," So these two are the coordinates of the image."
319920,324640," This one is the brightness that will be taken either from the first image or second one."
324640,326240," And this is the interpolation."
326240,328800," And we're able to actually interpolate between these two things."
328800,332160," And depending on how you train it, it's going to interpolate differently, right?"
332160,335920," So we can try to start over, right, and train it again."
335920,338720," And the interpolation itself is going to be slightly different, right?"
338720,341360," It's just depending on what kind of route it went."
342400,348480," Right, so sometimes it cannot really close the six, right?"
348480,350240," It takes a lot of time to close the six."
350240,352080," We can restart it one more time."
352080,354000," Because it's kind of a difficult shape, right?"
354000,357920," It's sort of like a loop, and for a neural network,"
357920,361600," sometimes it's kind of difficult to just sort of like close this entire loop."
361600,364800," Right, so we can slow down this learning process."
364800,368000," And now if we try to interpolate, it's slightly different now."
368000,369840," But here's an interesting thing."
369840,373920," We are using normalized coordinates, right?"
373920,379760," So that means we can upscale these images to any resolution we want, right?"
379760,381120," So I have a special key in here."
381120,387120," If I press S, it will generate a screenshot at a higher resolution of the current image, right?"
387120,389920," So if I take a look at upscale, this is how it looks like."
389920,398240," This is basically an eight reproduced by the neural network upscale to 512 by 512, right?"
398240,400080," So that's basically what it is."
400080,403680," But you can actually put something like in between, right?"
403680,404720," So something like here."
404720,407920," And let's actually reroute this entire image."
407920,409120," And this is how it's going to look like."
409120,412960," So it's using mathematical functions to interpolate those things."
412960,416160," And look how sort of like dreamy it is."
416160,423760," You can notice how sort of smooth and dreamy it is only when you upscale this entire thing, right?"
423760,428960," We cannot really upscale it here in real time because it takes quite some time to generate one"
428960,429520," single frame."
429520,431360," So we cannot see that in real time."
431360,437520," And I was thinking, what if we add a new functionality to this gym?"
437520,445520," So essentially, when I press a special key, it will actually render a video out of the interpolation."
445520,450000," So essentially, it will render a continuous video where it basically increases the value"
450000,452000," of the interpolator from zero to one."
452000,457440," And just within like five seconds, it animates that transition at higher resolution."
457440,465920," And we can actually see this sort of like a high resolution picture in motion, right?"
465920,472400," So what I want to see, I want to see a smooth animation like this, but at higher resolution,"
472400,477600," actually in like arbitrary high resolution, because again, all of the coordinates are normalized."
477600,479520," You can scale it as much as you want, right?"
479520,482640," So you can scale it indefinitely, right?"
482640,485840," So, and that's what I want you to do today, right?"
485840,488240," So that's basically the topic of today's stream."
488240,494720," We're going to literally generate a 60 FPS high resolution video of one digit interpolating"
494720,495840," to another one."
495840,497440," Does it sound cool?"
497440,499120," Sounds Gucci?"
499120,500640," Sounds Otama Gucci?"
500640,501120," Let's go."
501120,503200," Hello, hello, everyone."
503200,506560," So I suppose we've got some subs."
506560,508320," We've got only one sub, right?"
508320,510240," Nobody gives a shit about me today."
510240,514320," But anyway, thank you so much, everyone who subscribed yesterday."
515360,519760," So and for ducking, thank you so much for Twitch Prime subscription."
519760,521760," Seven minutes ago, I was doing intro."
521760,523120," But yeah."
523120,526720," Hello, hello, welcome, welcome, welcome."
526720,529200," So, all right."
529200,531280," So how are we going to be doing to all that?"
531280,532640," That's a very interesting question."
532640,542000," So the usual thing we can do is essentially just generate each frame and save it into the PNG, right?"
542000,549840," Save it into the PNG and then call ffmpeg and assemble those PNGs to like a single final video."
551040,556480," But some time ago, I saw somebody doing an actually pretty cool thing."
556480,559440," And I think it was MM2PL, but I don't remember."
559440,560560," I think it was MM2PL."
560560,568560," So essentially, ffmpeg has a very cool feature where it can read the video that you're trying to convert"
569120,570480," from the standard input."
570480,577680," And one of the formats it supports is raw frames, right?"
577680,584960," So essentially, you can, using some special flags, you can get ffmpeg into the mode,"
584960,592240," where it will read from the standard input, literally the binary bytes of frames in RGB32."
592240,596400," And it will automatically, in real time, assemble them into a video."
596400,603840," So essentially, what you have to do, you have to write a program that starts up ffmpeg as a child"
603840,611680," process, opens up a pipe between your program and ffmpeg and feeds the raw data into ffmpeg."
611680,616560," And ffmpeg is going to actually speed out the output video, right?"
616560,621600," So we can even draw this architecture to demonstrate that a little bit better."
621600,632720," Oh, it was… Yes, you did that with ffmpeg in the Discord General 3."
632720,634320," Okay, so yeah, I remember."
634320,638080," I think it was when we were doing the Olivets videos, right?"
638080,640560," Olivets streams, right?"
640560,646000," So, somebody actually did an animation with Olivets and submitted that in general."
646000,647360," Right, okay."
647360,650800," So essentially, we're going to have image, right?"
650800,654960," So imageNN, actually, it's image2NN, right?"
654960,657520," So this is basically our application."
657520,662080," So this entire thing will start ffmpeg, right?"
662080,667440," ffmpeg, like so."
668880,676240," Then it will establish a pipe between itself and its child's process, ffmpeg."
676240,678560," All right, so this is the pipe."
678560,682800," And it will start sending frames, like raw frames, into ffmpeg."
682800,690960," And then ffmpeg, in real time, is going to just render the video onto the file system."
690960,694400," So it's going to be output MP4, right?"
694400,695360," Output MP4."
695360,698480," So that's basically the architecture, right?"
698480,700720," So we can try to Google up how it's supposed to do that."
700720,703840," So let me, let me see."
703840,704960," So there were some flags."
704960,711840," ffmpeg, read raw frames from stdin."
711840,713520," Let's actually use Google this time."
713520,717600," ffmpeg, raw video, audio, stdin."
717600,719680," We don't really need audio today, right?"
719680,722640," So I suppose we're not going to do that."
723520,729120," This one, pipe.flv2.nxb, write raw video."
729120,733200," I think this one could be useful, but not really."
733200,734720," So let's take a look at the stack of the floor."
734720,736000," I suppose it loaded up."
736000,737600," Yeah."
737600,739120," Yeah, yeah."
739120,740320," This is basically what we need."
740320,743040," So you put an input as dash."
743040,747520," You say that the format that you're feeding into the ffmpeg is raw video."
747520,751360," You can set the codec to be raw video and PixFMT."
751360,756560," So here they use BGR24, but they'd like to use RGB32, right?"
756560,759600," So because it's just like very easy to work with, if you know what I mean."
759600,764320," So here, this is S and I don't remember what is S, I think."
764320,765840," Oh, this is a resolution, right?"
765840,769200," So essentially the size 0, size 1 and so on and so forth."
769200,770880," So this is going to be the resolution."
770880,773920," And then we have to provide the output in here."
773920,778960," So yeah, so we probably have to provide the codec and stuff like that."
778960,783440," But that's basically roughly the flags that we need to have in here, right?"
783440,786560," So I'm going to actually, you know, put that in the description, right?"
786560,794960," So because it's sort of a reference to how to read raw frames from stdin in ffmpeg."
794960,800480," So this is basically sort of the main thing that we're going to have in here, right?"
800480,802960," So to practice, how are we going to do all of that?"
802960,808640," Because doing all of that in C is kind of like a little bit tricky, right?"
808640,815680," So I suppose what we'll need to do, we need to have like a, you know, separate like a setup"
815680,821440," where we can try to practice how we can run, you know, ffmpeg as a child process, right?"
821440,823440," So because we have to do that in C, right?"
823440,826800," So another thing we have at our disposal is leap C."
826800,829360," And even leap C is not that useful in this specific case."
829360,831520," We have to use the Linux syscodes, right?"
831520,834560," Because you're supposed to create a child process."
834560,836480," You have to establish the pipe."
836480,840880," All of that is very much operating system related things, right?"
840880,843600," And just leap C is not going to help you much, right?"
843600,845920," You have to work with the Linux syscodes."
845920,851040," Of course, the gdpc, it has wrappers around syscodes, but I mean, it's still syscodes."
851040,851360," All right."
851360,854640," So we're going really like a low level, right?"
854640,859280," We're going really low level and we're almost like touching."
859280,863360," We're almost touching the syscodes of operating system."
863360,866240," That's how intimately we work with operating system."
866240,871840," We're just slightly touching our code and the operating system syscodes there."
871840,872720," Touch."
872720,875040," That's how intimate it is."
875040,879360," Anyways, so what we're going to do."
879360,882320," So let me create some sort of like a probe."
882320,887280," And what I want to do, I want to just like generate a video, right?"
887280,894240," Generate a video maybe of the ball bouncing off of the walls of the video or something like that."
894240,896560," So let's give it a try."
896560,903360," So it's going to be ffmpeg bouncing ball in C, right?"
903360,905760," So that sounds like a pretty good name for this entire thing."
905760,908240," And let's create a main.c file."
910080,917200," So stdio and let's actually do the hello world, of course."
917200,920800," Let's say printf hello seaman."
920800,922640," Right."
922640,926560," So let's actually do build sh, right?"
926560,929840," And we're going to do a bin sh."
931120,932560," We're going to enable the tracing."
932560,935680," So we're going to see all of the commands that are executing in here."
935680,938160," I'm going to do clank main main.c."
938160,943760," And I probably also want to enable all the warnings and all the extra warnings just in case."
943760,944000," Right."
944000,945680," I think it does in fact make sense."
945680,949280," And let's make this entire thing executable."
949280,949600," Right."
949600,951680," Let's make this entire thing executable."
951680,952400," And let's run it."
952400,955520," And let me actually run it."
955520,957040," As you can see, hello seaman."
957040,958080," Right."
958880,962560," So the first thing we probably need to do, the first thing we probably need to do,"
962560,964640," we need to run an external process."
964640,965760," Right."
965760,970720," Running an external process, a child process in a POSIX operating system is kind of a"
970720,972480," tricky thing."
973280,976320," It's a two phases trick."
976320,976640," Right."
976640,978320," It's a two phases trick."
978320,981920," If on Windows, you can just do something like create process."
981920,987440," Well, I don't really remember what's the API call for create process, but like, yeah."
987440,993760," So something like that in POSIX operating systems, you have to first fork the current process."
993760,994000," Right."
994000,1000160," And then execute and then replace is it's executable with a different executable."
1000160,1000800," Right."
1000800,1006800," So essentially, you can think of your process like this."
1006800,1007120," Right."
1007120,1010560," So essentially, let's actually establish, let's actually draw our process."
1010560,1011840," So this is our process."
1011840,1013360," There we go."
1013360,1020560," So this is your process and it executes instructions until it goes into the, it like basically runs"
1020560,1021760," into the fork Cisco."
1021760,1029600," At that point, at that point, operating system literally copies your entire process."
1029600,1035200," Like it literally copies your entire process and continues executing this entire thing."
1035200,1036000," Right."
1037600,1043920," So essentially, literally all of the instructions that you had in here and after the fork and in here"
1043920,1047360," and after the fork are going to be copied."
1047360,1049040," It's literally a copy."
1049040,1052960," It's literally a copy of the, of your process."
1052960,1057760," And the next thing you have to do, the next thing you have to do, you have to do in the child process."
1057760,1062720," You have to replace this entire image of the process with a different image."
1062720,1067520," And that is done with exec, exec syscoles."
1067520,1067680," Right."
1067680,1068400," There are several of them."
1068400,1073600," But what they do, they essentially take the path to the executable and they replace the current thing"
1073600,1075680," with the new executable."
1075680,1079280," And those you have a completely new process with the completely different instructions,"
1079280,1080880," a completely different memory and stuff like that."
1080880,1082640," So this is how basically it works."
1082640,1083840," Right."
1083840,1087280," But how do you know in which process you are running?"
1087280,1087520," Right."
1087520,1090720," Because you literally, I just did a fork."
1090720,1097600," And if everything is the same, how do you know whether you are a parent or a child?"
1097600,1100080," So that's a very interesting thing."
1100080,1100960," So you need to do exec."
1100960,1102240," But like, how do I know?"
1102240,1103280," Like I did a fork."
1103280,1103520," Right."
1103520,1104640," So I did a fork."
1104640,1108000," And now I just have two copies of the same thing running."
1108000,1110080," Like in which copy I have to do things."
1110080,1116640," Well, fork actually returns you the pid, the pid of the child."
1116640,1122240," And in the child, if you are in the child, this pid is equal to zero."
1122240,1123600," Right."
1123600,1127440," So the parent has the actual value of the child."
1127440,1127680," Right."
1127680,1130720," So it knows the pid of its own child."
1130720,1133120," But the child cannot be a child of itself."
1133120,1135120," So the only thing it gets is zero."
1135120,1140000," So that means here, if this entire thing is zero, you're supposed to do the exec."
1140000,1142240," So that's how you effectively do all of that."
1142240,1143040," Right."
1143040,1144880," So that's how we effectively do all of that."
1145520,1146880," So here you do a fork."
1146880,1150000," When you are in the child, you just do exec."
1150000,1152640," So, but that has a very interesting consequence."
1152640,1154800," That has a very interesting consequence."
1154800,1164880," You can put some additional code that is going to be executed in the child before starting the program."
1165920,1170400," That's actually a very interesting consequence of this entire two-stage system."
1170400,1176720," So this is the code that is not the program that you're trying to run as a child process."
1176720,1181120," But it's your own code before the actual child is going to execute."
1181120,1188480," And that is useful for setting up the environment for the child before the actual child program is going to execute."
1188480,1189280," If you know what I mean."
1189280,1190400," Right."
1190400,1191680," It's kind of interesting, actually."
1191680,1193280," So yeah."
1193280,1195680," Multiverse programming."
1195680,1195920," Yeah."
1195920,1200240," You have to think about processes like threads, I suppose."
1200240,1202320," But they don't really share the memory."
1202320,1202640," Right."
1202640,1212480," So as far as I know, in post-ex operating systems, like the difference between thread and the process is that threads do share memory and processes do not share the memory."
1212480,1212720," Right."
1212720,1215200," So that's the main difference."
1215200,1217360," But then you can actually have a shared memory."
1218000,1222560," So there is like a shared memory mechanism that allow you to share the memory between the processes."
1222560,1226000," So it gets very muddy and confusing at some point."
1226000,1226320," Right."
1226320,1227520," So like, what's the difference?"
1227520,1229680," What's the actual difference between thread and the process?"
1229680,1230320," I don't really know."
1230320,1235600," So maybe like, I'm also not a very low level developer."
1235600,1235760," Right."
1235760,1236880," Not a kernel developer."
1236880,1241360," Maybe some like hardcore Linux hackers can tell me what's the actual difference."
1241360,1242720," But yeah, I don't know."
1245440,1248000," And also, each process has its own collection of threads."
1248000,1248720," Yeah, I suppose."
1248720,1252960," Yeah."
1252960,1254160," Threads share the memory."
1254160,1257520," The OS also cannot tell the difference between threads, as I understand."
1257520,1258240," Interesting."
1258240,1258560," Yeah."
1258560,1259200," I didn't know that."
1259200,1261520," Right."
1261520,1262960," So we've got some subs."
1262960,1272400," So, thank you so much, MDDGWZRD, for T1 subscription with the message ""Hello, Siemen""."
1272400,1273840," Yes."
1275440,1278560," Hello."
1278560,1283600," So, let's continue."
1283600,1288400," So essentially, there is also a possibility that fork is not going to work."
1288400,1294480," So usually, one thing I like to do is to actually check that the child is not less than zero."
1294480,1296400," So we can take a look at the documentation of the fork."
1296400,1297920," Right."
1297920,1299760," So, and we take a look at the return."
1299760,1303440," On success, the bit of the child process is returned in the parent."
1303440,1305600," And zero is returned in the child."
1305600,1307040," Just like I explained."
1307040,1310000," On failure, minus one is returned in the parent."
1310000,1311760," No child process is created."
1311760,1313520," And error now is set appropriately."
1313520,1314160," Okay."
1314160,1318720," So essentially, if the child got negative, that means there is no child process."
1318720,1322720," The child process was not created in the first place because we failed to do so."
1322720,1325840," So in that case, we probably want to actually report an error."
1325840,1326960," Say something like:"
1326960,1333280," ""Error, classical POSIX could not fork a child""."
1334880,1337440," And here we can put some sort of a reason in here."
1337440,1337680," Yeah."
1337680,1339920," So we probably want to do something like:"
1339920,1342400," ""String an error no"", if I remember correctly."
1342400,1342640," Right."
1342640,1347280," So ""str error"", ""error no"", then return one."
1347280,1347520," Right."
1347520,1349200," So this is basically what we tried to do."
1349200,1351680," ""Could not fork a child""."
1351680,1354720," So in here, we can do something like this."
1354720,1354880," Right."
1354880,1356160," So we can do printf."
1356160,1361040," We can say ""hello from child""."
1361040,1361360," Right."
1361360,1362720," ""Hello from child""."
1362720,1366160," And here we can say, so here we can actually return zero."
1366160,1370800," ""Hello from parent""."
1370800,1380800," The child's PID is, and we can provide the number in here, so we can do child."
1380800,1382800," There we go."
1382800,1387040," So let's actually try to compile this into, I think, and see how it is going to work."
1387040,1390720," So we don't have a PID and fork in here, and this is because we need to"
1390720,1394400," include the POSIX-specific headers."
1394400,1394640," Right."
1394640,1396320," So POSIX-specific headers."
1396320,1397200," Here they are."
1397200,1400800," So SysTypes, UniSTD, you know, the usual stuff."
1400800,1406720," It's like an equivalent of including Windows.h on Windows."
1406720,1406880," Right."
1406880,1410000," But on Unix, you're supposed to do UniSTD and some other things."
1410000,1410240," Right."
1410240,1411440," So it's basically equivalent."
1411440,1412640," Right."
1412640,1416480," We're doing an equivalent of WinAPI programming, but on Linux."
1416480,1419200," That's how low level we are."
1419200,1420560," Just think about that."
1420560,1421520," Holy fucking shit."
1421520,1425680," Who does shit like that in 2023?"
1425680,1427520," Right."
1427520,1428080," So, yeah."
1428080,1431600," On Unix, you're supposed to have Unix-H, of course."
1431600,1431920," Yes."
1431920,1433840," But Linux is not Unix as far as I know."
1433840,1435280," Okay."
1435280,1436720," So let's actually rebuild this entire thing."
1436720,1437600," And it seems to be working."
1437600,1438960," And let's actually try to run it."
1438960,1443200," And as you can see, it said hello from child and hello from parent."
1443200,1445520," And the child bit is 22815."
1445520,1446560," Right."
1446560,1449680," And as you can see, if it was not creating a separate process,"
1449680,1452880," this code would never actually print both of the messages."
1452880,1456560," And this is because one message was printed from the child"
1456560,1458400," and another one was printed from the parent."
1458400,1460560," That's as simple as it is."
1460560,1461440," Right."
1461440,1463440," So the next thing we need to do, we need to actually"
1464640,1469280," basically substitute the current image of the child with the image of the ffmpax."
1469280,1473040," So it's usually done with exec functions."
1473040,1473280," Right."
1473280,1474400," So there's several of them."
1474400,1477520," So it's a whole family of the functions."
1477520,1482480," They essentially do the same thing, but they kind of like act differently."
1482480,1485600," So as far as I know, the ones that have a prefix p,"
1485600,1490960," they search for the program in a path environment variable."
1490960,1496080," The ones that do not have p, they actually expect you to have like a full path."
1496080,1498320," So in that case, we're supposed to use p."
1498320,1498960," Right."
1498960,1503920," So on top of that, there is a v version and v version accept the arguments as an array."
1503920,1509680," The ones that don't have the v version, they accept the arguments as variatics."
1509680,1510000," Right."
1510000,1513680," And variatic arguments is basically in c, you can have functions"
1513680,1516960," that accept arbitrary amount of things like printf."
1516960,1521360," In printf, you can put as many, you know, arguments here as you want."
1521360,1523840," And that's what's called variatic functions."
1523840,1524080," Right."
1524080,1526320," So because they have variatic amount of arguments."
1526320,1527600," Right."
1527600,1531520," So usually what I like to have, what I like to use, I like to use exec lp."
1531520,1532560," Right."
1532560,1536400," Because I want this thing to search in the path environment variable."
1536400,1540560," And I also like that it uses, you know, variatic arguments."
1540560,1542960," So I don't have to create arrays or anything like that."
1542960,1545920," But there is a little bit of a problem in here."
1545920,1546160," Right."
1546160,1549200," So we have to be aware of how exactly it works."
1549200,1552240," So we have to provide the name of the program."
1552240,1552880," Right."
1552880,1556400," And you have to provide the name of the program one more time,"
1556400,1560880," because that's what gets passed into the arguments of the program anyway."
1560880,1561760," Right."
1562400,1570560," So because if you program it in C a little bit, you know that in argv here, in argv,"
1570560,1574560," the very first argument is the name of the program that was run."
1574560,1576720," And that's exactly what we're doing here."
1576720,1579760," So we're saying, okay, I want to execute ffmpeg."
1579760,1582480," And I want it to find in path environment variable."
1582480,1585040," And here are the arguments of that thing."
1585040,1588480," And because the first argument is the name of the program,"
1588480,1590320," that's what you have to put in here."
1590320,1590720," Right."
1590720,1594160," So essentially, you put here the arguments that are going to be passed"
1594160,1596960," into the args of that program in here."
1596960,1599120," And that includes the program thing."
1599120,1608880," Why do the BTC transfers take so long?"
1608880,1612240," By the way, I'm really sorry that I can only accept BTC right now."
1612240,1615200," And I'm really sorry that I cannot acknowledge them on the stream"
1615200,1618080," because I don't have an appropriate setup to do all of that."
1618080,1622080," And I know that this kind of thing is very inconvenient."
1622080,1626960," I plan to add more options to donate in the future."
1626960,1631120," Unfortunately, I just can't find some time to just like sit down and learn"
1631120,1634160," all of the cryptocurrency madness."
1634160,1639120," Because I also need to work on the content and prepare for the streams"
1639120,1640800," and also edit the votes."
1640800,1642640," There's like a lot of things I have to do."
1642640,1645520," And it's just like, I also need to do the crypto thing."
1645520,1650720," But I really appreciate whoever like found time to still donate through BTC."
1650720,1652000," I really appreciate that."
1652000,1654880," So at some point I will get to that and there will be more options."
1654880,1658880," If it's very inconvenient for you right now, just don't donate anything."
1658880,1660160," Right."
1660160,1663360," If it's even mildly inconvenient, don't donate anything."
1663360,1665280," Just wait until I release more options."
1665280,1665840," Okay."
1665840,1667840," So I don't really want to cause too much inconvenience."
1667840,1669840," And I really apologize if I do."
1669840,1671440," Right."
1671440,1674160," So thank you so much."
1674160,1675040," Thank you."
1675040,1675280," Thank you."
1675280,1675680," Thank you."
1675680,1675680," Thank you."
1675680,1675680," Thank you."
1675680,1679680," Anyways."
1679680,1684000," And another thing, what we have to do in here, by the way, we also have to end."
1684000,1686400," So here comes the arguments, right?"
1686400,1687520," So here comes the arguments."
1687520,1692160," So as far as I know, we have to put I and then dash in here."
1692160,1693680," So here we can do something like this."
1693680,1695920," One, two, three, four."
1695920,1699760," Since we're going to have a lot of arguments in here, it would be better to actually organize"
1699760,1700560," them like this."
1700560,1700800," Right."
1700800,1703520," You know, like a big list because we're going to put a lot of things in here."
1703520,1704640," Right."
1704640,1705520," So we're going to have in here."
1705520,1708080," And if I remember correctly."
1708080,1708240," Yeah."
1708240,1709360," So we have these things."
1709360,1710880," So the format is going to be F."
1710880,1712720," Right."
1712720,1716240," So this is going to be format, row video and so on and so forth."
1716240,1716800," Right."
1716800,1717840," And at the end."
1717840,1718080," Right."
1718080,1719600," So this is obviously not finished."
1719600,1719760," Right."
1719760,1720720," This is obviously not finished."
1720720,1721840," We have to put null in here."
1721840,1723120," Right."
1723120,1727040," And null indicates the end of the arguments."
1727040,1727200," Right."
1727200,1733520," And which is a little bit bizarre, in my opinion, which is a little bit bizarre because printf"
1733520,1735760," doesn't require this kind of education."
1735760,1740800," So I can always just do hello world, then put D in here and then 69."
1740800,1743920," And I never have to indicate the end of the arguments."
1743920,1749440," Somehow printf actually figures out the amount of arguments that I put in here."
1749440,1751920," So why do I have to put null in here?"
1753040,1754480," Why do I have to put null in here?"
1754480,1760960," So there is a fundamental problem with variadic in C."
1760960,1768080," When you're writing a variadic function, you fundamentally don't know how many arguments are"
1768080,1768960," going to be passed in there."
1768960,1770720," You literally don't know."
1770720,1778080," The thing you have to do, you have to pass additional information of how many arguments you have"
1778080,1780320," along with the function code."
1780960,1786800," In case of execlp, you indicate that by providing null because you can only access them sequentially."
1786800,1786960," Right."
1786960,1788560," So you can access them sequentially."
1788560,1792800," And as soon as you encounter null, the function knows, okay, so this is the end of the arguments."
1792800,1794880," I'm not going to continue processing arguments."
1794880,1796400," Otherwise, I'm going to corrupt this stack."
1796400,1797520," Right."
1797520,1803120," You can pass maybe a number in here, but I generally found that very inconvenient because"
1803120,1809040," you always forget to update that number when you add new arguments, so it's generally not convenient."
1809040,1812800," The question is how the fuck printf knows how many arguments you put in there."
1812800,1821120," This is because the amount of arguments of printf is encoded in a format string."
1823520,1830960," So printf processes the format string and it encounters $, so it knows that the next"
1830960,1832240," argument has to be integer."
1832240,1832800," Right."
1832800,1839200," Then it encounters s, okay, so it queries the next argument and then it finishes the process,"
1839200,1843920," the format string, so it knows that there's no more arguments, so that's why you never have"
1843920,1846960," to provide the amount of arguments because you already do."
1846960,1849120," That's why."
1849120,1851280," This is actually very interesting."
1851280,1855200," You may think that you do not provide the amount of arguments to printf, but you do."
1855200,1857040," You just didn't notice that."
1857040,1860240," The amount of arguments is encoded in the format string."
1860240,1862320," That's how it works."
1862320,1865600," What's funny is that it was not obvious to me from the start."
1865600,1870960," It's really not obvious unless you try to write your own variadic function."
1870960,1873520," As soon as you try to write your own variadic function,"
1873520,1876800," you realize, oh, that makes a lot of sense."
1876800,1880720," It's just like, this is the things that we don't really think about too much,"
1880720,1882400," right, but they're there."
1882400,1885840," And they actually justify a lot of weird decisions like this."
1885840,1887120," Like, why do you put null in here?"
1887120,1890000," Because there's no other way to know how many arguments you have in here,"
1890000,1891280," because this is how c works."
1891280,1894080," Right, and printf kind of does the same."
1903120,1905040," So, all right."
1905040,1910880," So, let's actually not provide any arguments in here, because one of the things I want to do,"
1910880,1913760," I want to literally just run this thing."
1914640,1923040," So, if I remember correctly, this thing will return a negative value on an error, just like any POSIX function, right?"
1924000,1933440," So, here we can say printf and std error, error, how are we going to say that?"
1933440,1939440," Could not run ffmpeg as a child process, right?"
1939440,1944160," Because of reasons, std error, error no, that's the reason."
1944160,1946720," And we're going to exit with one, otherwise we're going to exit with..."
1946720,1949120," That's actually it, right?"
1949120,1956560," So, essentially, if the child process was successfully executed, everything after that call is going to be"
1956560,1958480," completely erased, right?"
1958480,1963200," Because the entire execution process is going to be substituted with whatever we have in ffmpeg."
1963760,1969520," So, we only can reach this point if return was negative, right?"
1969520,1975360," Which is rather interesting, which also means that this thing is unreachable, right?"
1976960,1984960," Yeah, this specific place is literally unreachable, because you can only reach here if there was an error, right?"
1984960,1986160," If you didn't..."
1986160,1988640," Yeah, so this has to be set as unreachable, I think."
1988640,1989280," That makes sense."
1989280,1991200," Anyway, all right."
1991200,1994800," So, let's try to compile this entire thing and see what's going to happen."
1994800,1997520," So, we have a couple of unused things in here, right?"
1997520,2000160," So, maybe it makes sense for me to put a void in here."
2000160,2003760," It was also complaining about assertion, right?"
2003760,2005680," So, let's go ahead and do that, okay."
2005680,2008960," So, if we try to do main, right?"
2008960,2010080," So, it says hello."
2010080,2014160," Yeah, so, and we can't see the child process."
2014160,2018000," And I suspect this is because of the Emacs, right?"
2018000,2020480," Because Emacs compilation mode is a little bit weird."
2020480,2021840," If I just run it..."
2021840,2022560," Yeah, there we go."
2022560,2025840," So, if I run it as just like a regular child process, here is what we can see."
2025840,2032720," So, what's funny is that we first see the parent and only then we see the child."
2032720,2034560," So, look at that."
2036400,2045120," We run the child first, but the message of the hello parent executed after, right?"
2045120,2050000," So, but then here we see the child first and then the message here."
2050000,2051840," And this is because of two separate processes, right?"
2051840,2055440," So, it's sort of like a race condition situation, right?"
2056080,2060880," So, because they are running like in like asynchronously essentially."
2060880,2068240," So, one thing we probably want to do in here, we probably want to wait until the child has finished"
2068240,2069360," executing, right?"
2069360,2075040," So, essentially here we executed the child and we want to wait until it's finished executed, right?"
2075040,2079760," So, we want to like exit from the parent until the child has finished doing any work."
2079760,2085120," So, for that, there is a special function literally called wait, believe it or not, right?"
2085120,2088480," So, it just waits on the pid, right?"
2088480,2090240," So, this one is rather convenient, right?"
2090240,2094000," So, this specific variable, it accepts wStatus, right?"
2094000,2101520," So, wStatus is pointed to a variable and when wait actually exits, it will return you"
2101520,2105840," information about what exactly happened to the child, right?"
2105840,2107200," What exactly happened to the child?"
2107200,2109280," So, there's a couple of special macros in here."
2109280,2113920," So, this macro will tell you whether the child just exited, right?"
2113920,2117040," So, this macro will tell you the exit status, right?"
2117040,2118960," So, essentially the exit code of the child."
2118960,2120800," So, there's another thing."
2120800,2126560," For example, here if the child was terminated by a signal, right?"
2126560,2129120," Whether it was killed, right?"
2129120,2133600," So, and also you can get the termination signal and stuff like that."
2133600,2139680," So, basically in that wStatus, there is a lot of information encoded, right?"
2139680,2145120," And wait effectively actually waits for any of the changes happening to the process, right?"
2145120,2150320," So, as soon as some change happens, the wait will exit and then you will be able to extract that"
2150320,2152640," information out of this entire thing."
2152640,2155760," But as far as I know, you can set the wStatus to null."
2155760,2160800," And basically, it will tell the kernel that you don't care about what happened."
2160800,2165600," You just want to wait until the child has changed its status, right?"
2165600,2169280," And usually that will mean that it finished executing, right?"
2169280,2172000," So, that's basically what we want to do."
2172000,2174880," So, we want to just wait in here."
2174880,2179120," And here we can say something."
2183440,2187680," done rendering the video, right?"
2187680,2188320," Something like that."
2188320,2190080," We're not going to provide the child in here, right?"
2190080,2191920," But something like this."
2191920,2192960," Okay, let's recompile."
2192960,2197280," So, wait actually wants a special header, right?"
2197280,2199120," So, what kind of headers do we want to include in here?"
2199120,2203120," We want to have types and wait, but we already have types."
2203120,2204960," So, we don't really need to include that twice."
2205840,2207840," All right, so that's the headers we want in here."
2207840,2210240," And there we go."
2210240,2212880," So, if we try to run this entire thing,"
2212880,2216480," it is going to have done rendering the video always at the end."
2216480,2220560," Because it first waits until the ffmpac has finished executing."
2220560,2222560," And only then prints this entire thing."
2222560,2226240," So, everything here is in sync, right?"
2226240,2227360," So, we're executing the child."
2227360,2228480," And then we wait for the child."
2228480,2231040," And only then we do something with the result."
2231040,2231840," Isn't that cool?"
2231840,2232720," Isn't it epic?"
2232720,2234400," I think that's pretty freaking epic."
2234400,2235680," Right."
2235680,2241280," So, but if we enable this flag, right?"
2241280,2246480," If we enable this flag, that means that we say to ffmpac"
2246480,2249840," that it should expect the data from the standard input."
2249840,2258640," So, how can we even now feed that stuff into the standard input of ffmpac?"
2260000,2262160," That is a very interesting question."
2262160,2264880," So, first of all, we need to establish a pipe."
2264880,2265200," Right."
2265200,2266720," So, we need to create a pipe."
2266720,2267520," What is a pipe?"
2267520,2269120," All right."
2269120,2271200," So, let's actually search for a pipe."
2271200,2271600," There we go."
2271600,2272880," So, there is a special sys call."
2272880,2274800," And here is a pipe."
2274800,2276320," So, this is a very interesting function."
2276320,2279840," So, we probably want to execute that before we fork any children."
2279840,2280000," Right."
2280000,2281360," So, somewhere here."
2281360,2286080," And what it accepts, it accepts an array of two elements."
2286080,2286320," Right."
2286320,2288480," So, this is basically how you have to call it."
2288480,2288640," Right."
2288640,2289920," So, you call it like that."
2289920,2292720," And, of course, it returns an integer."
2292720,2297680," And, essentially, if it's negative, we have to report an error saying that you couldn't create a pipe."
2298720,2302880," STD error error could not create a pipe."
2302880,2303360," Right."
2303360,2304960," Because of some stupid reason."
2304960,2307120," Let's actually print the reason, just in case."
2307120,2307840," Because, why not?"
2307840,2309200," Right."
2309200,2313520," And, essentially, what it does, it creates two file descriptors."
2314240,2315760," The read file descriptors."
2315760,2317680," The read end of this thing."
2317680,2318880," And the write end."
2318880,2320720," Right."
2320720,2325920," So, and essentially, it puts both of the descriptors into the elements of this array."
2325920,2327440," Right."
2327440,2329360," It puts them there."
2329360,2333520," So, and I don't remember which one is read and which one is write."
2333520,2339280," So, creates a pipe, a unidirectional data channel that can be used for interpersonal documentation."
2339280,2344320," ArrayPIPFD is used to return two file descriptors referring to the ends of the pipe."
2344320,2347760," Zero refers to the read end of the pipe."
2347760,2350720," And one refers to the write end of the pipe."
2350720,2357040," So, essentially, everything you write into that end using, literally, the write syscall."
2357040,2358160," Right."
2358160,2360080," So, there is a, this is not really a syscall."
2360080,2362000," This is an external command."
2362000,2362240," Right."
2362240,2367120," But what we have to do, we have to use write on the second section in here."
2367120,2367600," Right."
2367600,2372960," So, if you write into that file descriptor using this syscall,"
2372960,2378640," it will appear on the read end that you can read with the read syscall."
2378640,2378880," Right."
2378880,2381840," So, it acts like a file, like a Unix file."
2381840,2383440," Literally."
2383440,2387040," So, and essentially what you have to do, if you want to establish like a pipe"
2387040,2390320," between two processes or between two threads or something like that,"
2390320,2395760," you just give one end to another process and another end to the first process,"
2395760,2398160," and they can communicate through that pipe."
2398160,2402000," Like, and they'll be able to read and write to these things like files."
2402000,2403120," Right."
2403120,2404800," Well, it's unidirectional one."
2404800,2408160," So, you can only write into one end and read from another one."
2408160,2413440," So, there's probably some like maybe multi-directional ones, but I'm not really aware of them because"
2413440,2415200," I'm not a, I'm not a programmer."
2415200,2416960," It's like a socket."
2416960,2417280," Yeah."
2417280,2421840," So, but as far as I know, socket is like a multi-directional or bi-directional."
2421840,2422080," Right."
2422080,2424160," So, it's more of a bi-directional thing."
2424160,2428560," This thing is unidirectional, and it's also used like for local things."
2428560,2432960," Multi-directional pipe is called two pipes."
2432960,2433120," Yeah."
2433120,2435440," I suppose we just create two pipes for this entire thing."
2435440,2443680," But what's interesting about the ends of the pipe is that they're file descriptors, just like when you open a file."
2444240,2449600," or standard input and standard outputs are also file descriptors."
2450400,2461200," So, if we somehow replace the standard input of FFMPAC process with the read end of the pipe,"
2461200,2467840," we'll be able to actually feed the data from the parent into the standard input of FFMPAC."
2473280,2474320," See what I mean?"
2474320,2475840," So, we're on the right track."
2475840,2480800," So, okay."
2480800,2487360," So, I actually want to maybe create a couple of macros in here so I don't confuse myself."
2487360,2488800," So, zero is a read end."
2488800,2497200," So, read end is going to be zero and write end is going to be one."
2497200,2498960," All right."
2498960,2500320," And here's the interesting thing."
2500320,2504560," So, since we're forking and cloning the processes,"
2504560,2509280," child, in fact, is aware of the file descriptors."
2509280,2517520," So, we create pipe in here and both child and parent know the file descriptors of this pipe."
2517520,2519680," Right."
2519680,2527280," And this is where an ability to just prepare something right before actually executing the child comes into place."
2527280,2528560," Right."
2528560,2534880," So, you can use this time before actually running the thing to establish the connection with the parent."
2534880,2537360," You know what I mean?"
2537360,2538000," Right."
2538000,2540720," So, and this is why it's usually like very important."
2540720,2541040," Right."
2541040,2543920," To have that a little bit of a time so we can set things up."
2543920,2545600," Right."
2546400,2552320," So, essentially, we need to replace the standard input with the read end of the pipe."
2552320,2554160," How can we do that?"
2554160,2558320," Well, for that, in POSIX, there is a special sys call called dup2."
2558320,2558560," Right."
2558560,2562560," It's just actually generally like a family of functions called like dup."
2562560,2564720," But the one that we care about is dup2."
2564720,2565200," Right."
2566960,2571280," So, and essentially dup2 accepts two file descriptors."
2571280,2571760," Right."
2571760,2573280," Two specific file descriptors."
2573280,2575680," An old one and a new one."
2575680,2586000," So, and essentially what it does, it takes the old file descriptor and kind of reopens it or renames it into a new one."
2587360,2588000," You know what I mean?"
2588000,2592080," So, I don't know, like, what's the actual wording of the description?"
2592080,2593200," Right."
2593200,2601440," So, dup2 system performs the same task as dup, but instead of using the lowest number unused file descriptor, it uses the file descriptor specified by newfd."
2601440,2603040," Right."
2603040,2610080," So, essentially, it tricks the process into thinking that this file descriptor is actually this one."
2610080,2610960," Right."
2610960,2615440," So, and essentially what we can do, we can say dup2."
2615440,2615760," Okay."
2615760,2617120," So, what we care about?"
2617120,2618720," We need a pipe fd."
2618720,2618960," Right."
2618960,2621200," We need the read end of that pipe."
2621200,2628480," And we say, basically, reopen that read end as stdin number."
2628480,2630400," I don't remember which one was that."
2630400,2632960," How is it called?"
2632960,2633680," stdin."
2633680,2638320," There was a macro for that."
2638320,2638720," Right."
2638720,2640400," So, there was a macro for that."
2642240,2642880," ellipse."
2642880,2644800," ellipse."
2644800,2648960," stdin number."
2648960,2649840," Who remembers?"
2649840,2651360," Who remembers the macro?"
2651360,2651600," Yeah."
2651600,2653360," I know that you can use 0, 1, 2."
2653360,2657600," But there was a macro that specifically defined."
2657600,2658400," Yeah."
2658400,2659120," File, no."
2659120,2659520," Yeah."
2659520,2660160," Thank you so much."
2660160,2660640," File, no."
2660640,2660880," Yeah."
2660880,2661840," Because I keep forgetting."
2661840,2662080," Right."
2662080,2666320," So, I want to work, like, with semantic names."
2666320,2666640," Right."
2666640,2668480," So, I could have just, like, put 1 in there."
2668480,2669680," Right."
2669680,2670240," Or 0."
2670240,2671120," I don't remember."
2671120,2673440," And that's exactly why I want to use this thing."
2673440,2674480," Because I don't quite remember."
2674480,2676080," It's 0, 1, whatever."
2676080,2677760," File, you know, stdin file, no."
2677760,2678800," Right."
2678800,2682000," So, I'm essentially reopening this thing as the input."
2682000,2682480," Right."
2682480,2688560," So, and then, if this entire thing is less than 0, that means there was a problem in here."
2688560,2699520," Error could not reopen read end of the pipe as standard stdin or something."
2699520,2704000," Not really particularly useful, you know, error description."
2704000,2706640," But it is what it is, and it isn't what it isn't."
2706640,2709040," And that should be sufficient, actually, now."
2709040,2713200," As far as you know, the other thing that people do, and that is kind of important,"
2713200,2720560," is that you want to close the right end on this side."
2720560,2720880," Right."
2720880,2724080," Because the child doesn't really need the right end."
2724080,2728400," Since you sort of fork the process, the file descriptor is also forked."
2728400,2731120," And since you're not using the right end, you can close it."
2731120,2733760," But it's going to stay open on the parent's end."
2733760,2739200," On the parent's end, you probably want to actually close the read end."
2739200,2742080," Because you're going to be writing right into this entire thing."
2742080,2742320," Right."
2742320,2747600," So, we're going to do write read end."
2747600,2749360," And then we're waiting for this entire thing."
2749360,2750880," Okay."
2750880,2754000," So, now we just need to test all of that."
2754000,2754240," Right."
2754240,2755520," Now we just need to test all of that."
2755520,2757440," So, let's actually enable the extended input."
2758160,2759040," The raw video."
2759040,2760160," Right."
2760160,2761920," So, let me actually see."
2761920,2765760," Maybe before we test all of that, let me actually just compile."
2765760,2766080," Right."
2766080,2767200," Just to make sure that, yeah."
2767200,2767520," Okay."
2767520,2768400," Everything is compiled."
2768400,2769920," That's cool."
2769920,2770880," Right."
2770880,2772480," So, we have to provide the codec."
2772480,2776640," So, this is going to be the codec."
2776640,2779600," They're using single quotes."
2779600,2783360," We are using double quotes because we're Chad C developers."
2783360,2785840," Anyway, I'm sorry."
2785840,2786800," I'm joking, by the way."
2786800,2793520," So, file format, like pixel format."
2793520,2796240," I think I want to use RGBA 32."
2796240,2800480," I don't know if FFMPax actually supports this kind of stuff, but we'll find out."
2801040,2801680," All right."
2801680,2807200," So, here I suppose one of the things we have to provide is essentially the output codec."
2807200,2812000," lib x 264 or so 56."
2812000,2812400," I think."
2812400,2814640," I think that's the codec that you want to use."
2814640,2817280," lib x 256."
2817280,2818640," 54."
2818640,2819120," I'm sorry."
2819120,2820640," Yeah."
2820640,2821360," So, that's that."
2821360,2823440," Is it 64?"
2823440,2823760," Okay."
2823760,2824240," I'm sorry."
2824240,2829680," And also, we want to output that to MP4."
2829680,2829920," Right."
2829920,2832400," So, we want to output that to MP4."
2832400,2836400," So, one of the things we probably want to do, by the way."
2836400,2836720," Right."
2836720,2840000," So, I forgot to specify the size of this entire thing."
2840000,2841600," So, let's actually specify the size."
2841600,2842640," The size was s."
2842640,2848320," And let's say that we're going to have something like 800 by 600."
2848320,2850080," So, this is how you specify the size."
2850080,2851520," All right."
2851520,2858800," So, now we can just try to go ahead and like send all of the data there."
2858800,2860960," So, let's actually try to render a single frame."
2860960,2862960," Well, let's try to render a single frame."
2862960,2864000," So, we're going to iterate."
2864000,2867680," Since we have a size 800 by 600."
2867680,2871440," So, we're going to have something like 800 by 600 plus plus i."
2871440,2872640," All right."
2872640,2873760," And what we're going to print in there."
2873760,2874560," We're going to."
2874560,2877600," We have to write into pipe fd."
2877600,2879360," Right end."
2879360,2879600," Right."
2879600,2880880," So, this is going to be right end."
2880880,2883680," And we need to actually provide the buffer."
2883680,2884960," So, let's actually provide the buffer."
2884960,2887600," So, this is going to be a single pixel."
2887600,2889040," And the pixel is going to be red."
2889040,2890080," Right."
2890080,2891360," So, this is the red pixel."
2891360,2893440," So, we're going to provide the pointer to this thing."
2893440,2894640," And yeah."
2894640,2896560," We're going to write pixel by pixel."
2896560,2899360," It's probably not a particularly great idea."
2899920,2901920," writing all that stuff pixel by pixel."
2901920,2904240," But it is what it is."
2904240,2905360," And it isn't what it isn't."
2905360,2906240," So, let's give it a try."
2906240,2907680," So, let's try to build this entire thing."
2907680,2908800," So, it doesn't really work."
2908800,2909920," Right."
2909920,2912160," So, we need to provide std int."
2912160,2912400," Right."
2912400,2913760," So, this is going to be std int."
2913760,2914400," Okay."
2914400,2916720," So, let's see if it's going to work."
2916720,2917120," Right."
2917120,2918640," So, I'm going to just do that."
2918640,2921600," And invalid data found when processing the input."
2921600,2924320," That is very interesting."
2924320,2928240," So, really weird."
2928240,2932240," It's not particularly useful information in my opinion."
2932240,2936640," So, what was it saying?"
2936640,2938800," So, some people were saying in the chat."
2938800,2939920," I do quite remember."
2939920,2943840," Somebody is shooting outside."
2943840,2948880," Well, it is what it is."
2948880,2950000," And it is and what it isn't."
2950000,2952640," So, there's already."
2952640,2954560," The war actually reached Siberia."
2956480,2958560," Ukrainian forces are already deep inside."
2958560,2962000," In Siberia."
2962000,2962560," Okay."
2962560,2966880," So, we have to provide the, I think, V codec."
2966880,2967120," Right."
2967120,2972320," And let's try to reveal that one more time."
2972320,2974320," And see if it's going to work."
2974320,2974880," Okay."
2974880,2976720," So, invalid log level."
2976720,2981840," So, that's really interesting."
2981840,2984800," So, invalid log level libx."
2984800,2987280," So, I suppose that's what happened here."
2987280,2992160," Let's actually combine the build and this entire thing."
2992160,2993840," All right."
2993840,2995280," Invalid pipe."
2995280,2997120," So, there's problem with pipe."
2997120,2997360," Right."
2997360,2998560," Invalid data found."
2998560,3000320," Right."
3000320,3001440," Invalid data found."
3001440,3003840," That is really weird."
3003840,3010240," So, it doesn't like the data that we sent into the pipe."
3010240,3011520," Right."
3011520,3012720," It doesn't like the data."
3012720,3016480," So, let's actually find for maybe other things."
3016480,3017600," Because that should work."
3017600,3020480," Maybe, is it just RGBA?"
3020480,3022480," It could be just."
3022480,3023760," No, it's just that."
3023760,3027360," So, let me find."
3027360,3033920," How can I pipe data losslessly into the FFM pack?"
3036080,3037440," necessary cookies only."
3037440,3041840," Input."
3041840,3055120," Maybe we also need to do FPS."
3055120,3055520," Right."
3055520,3057040," So, I forgot FPS."
3057040,3058480," So, it has to be also rate."
3058480,3062720," So, albertgpttwitch actually suggests that."
3062720,3063600," So, let's actually."
3063600,3064320," Let me take a look."
3065040,3066000," RGB24."
3066000,3068720," I don't really want to use RGB24, honestly."
3068720,3071040," I want an RGBA 32."
3071040,3076320," Though, I'm not sure if it's particularly useful."
3076320,3076640," Right."
3076640,3081040," So, I can do SV."
3081040,3084480," So, I think I forgot the rate."
3084480,3086960," But I'm not sure how useful that would be."
3086960,3088880," Okay."
3088880,3089680," So, let me see."
3089680,3093520," Invalid data."
3093520,3094880," I'm not sure."
3094880,3100160," So, I close that."
3100160,3112880," That is rather weird."
3112880,3116320," Is that because I have to put the pixels?"
3116320,3116640," Okay."
3116640,3121600," Let's actually introduce 800 by 600."
3121600,3122080," Right."
3122080,3123280," So, let's do something like that."
3123280,3129760," uint32 pixels width height."
3129760,3130320," Right."
3130320,3136240," And let's actually simply fill up this entire thing."
3136240,3136480," Right."
3136480,3137840," So, this is going to be size 2."
3137840,3140080," Less than width."
3140080,3143200," And ffmpact."
3143200,3147040," Especially, I like how ffmpact is completely useless in that regard."
3147040,3149360," Like, it doesn't really provide any useful information."
3149360,3150800," It's just like invalid data."
3150800,3152320," I don't fucking know, dude."
3152320,3153040," I don't know."
3153040,3158000," So, oopsie doopsie."
3158000,3158880," Fucky wacky."
3158880,3161520," You know, the usual stuff."
3161520,3164320," So, pixels."
3164320,3165840," This is going to be i."
3166960,3168240," 0 0 0 0 at f."
3168240,3172640," And one of the things we probably want to do."
3172640,3173040," Right."
3173040,3176000," So, we just want to provide the pixels."
3176000,3182000," Size of pixels multiplied by width and multiplied by height."
3182000,3183600," So, maybe that's the problem in here."
3183600,3185280," Right."
3185280,3187760," So, maybe it doesn't like this entire stuff."
3190480,3191600," Right."
3191600,3193200," Still invalid processing data."
3193200,3197680," All right."
3197680,3199280," So, let me see."
3199280,3202640," What could I have forgotten?"
3202640,3205200," What could I have forgotten?"
3205200,3209280," Read and write video frames Python using ffmpact."
3209280,3213440," What kind of flags I could have forgotten?"
3213440,3213760," Okay."
3213760,3218400," Why everyone uses RGB24?"
3218400,3221440," It's not particularly convenient to use RGB24."
3221440,3224160," In my opinion."
3224160,3226960," So, Vcodec."
3226960,3236480," Do not expect any audio."
3236480,3239120," We can try to enable that as well."
3239120,3242320," Do not expect any audio."
3249200,3251120," So, Vcodec."
3251120,3253520," We already set this thing in here."
3253520,3262720," Overwrite output file."
3262720,3265600," Maybe this is one of the things that could have been useful."
3265600,3265920," Right."
3265920,3267280," Overwrite file."
3267280,3268400," The standard input."
3268400,3270640," The format is RAW."
3270640,3273840," Vcodec that we're accepting here is RAW."
3273840,3274080," Yes."
3274080,3275680," PixFMT."
3275680,3275920," Okay."
3275920,3276720," ffmpact."
3276720,3280480," PixFMT RGBA32."
3280480,3281520," Is there something like that?"
3281520,3288480," RGB32."
3293680,3295360," So, let me see."
3295360,3298160," Okay."
3298160,3300640," So, we can say RGB32."
3308720,3323600," The most annoying thing is that I tried that before the stream and it worked, but I don't remember the flags."
3323600,3326320," Raw frames."
3328560,3342160," So, we can try to enable logging, maybe."
3342160,3345040," Let's see."
3345040,3351040," What's interesting is that I don't need anything but just the right flags."
3351040,3357040," And it's so goddamn hard to come up with the right flags."
3357040,3358560," It's just like, holy shit."
3358560,3360000," Not."
3360000,3366160," Have we heard about such format?"
3366160,3367040," Not."
3367040,3367600," Not."
3367600,3369520," Not."
3369520,3370000," Not."
3370000,3370000," Not."
3370000,3370480," Not."
3370480,3379120," Okay."
3379120,3380160," I'm going to look up."
3380160,3381920," Well, maybe not."
3381920,3382560," Log level."
3382560,3385360," ffmpag log level."
3386720,3389200," The ffmpag is so goddamn annoying."
3389200,3390480," Like, holy shit."
3390480,3393040," It's just like, it's doing too much as well."
3393040,3395200," It's just like doing too much and it's so obscure."
3395200,3398560," All right."
3398560,3400720," So, ff documentation."
3404640,3417280," I don't think it's dependent on this thing."
3417280,3428960," I also remember RGBA working."
3428960,3432160," I quite vividly remember that thing working."
3432160,3433600," Like, I do."
3433600,3435920," Like, this should be enough."
3435920,3440560," But it's just like, I don't fucking know, man."
3440560,3444000," Log level."
3444000,3448960," So, oh, I hate if I think like."
3448960,3450560," Okay."
3450560,3451520," How do I use that?"
3451520,3452800," Log level."
3454000,3454560," Why is it?"
3454560,3454800," Why is it?"
3454800,3455840," This is so weird."
3455840,3457440," It's just like, freaking."
3457440,3459920," Okay."
3459920,3460880," So, all right."
3460880,3463600," So, repeat level verbose."
3463600,3463840," Okay."
3463840,3464480," Let's enable."
3468480,3472000," Log level verbose."
3472000,3482640," So, invalid data found when processing input."
3482640,3484560," Just a second."
3484560,3486320," I had some notes before the stream."
3486320,3493120," So, one of the things I think that we have to do is enable"
3493120,3496880," this thing."
3498480,3504160," No."
3504160,3513360," Something different."
3513360,3514160," Holy shit."
3514160,3515120," Something different."
3515120,3516400," What the fuck?"
3516400,3516640," Okay."
3525040,3529040," So, if you put it like that, invalid data found in processing unit."
3529040,3531760," If you put it like that, it's invalid argument."
3531760,3535200," Fucking."
3535200,3537520," Who designed this shit?"
3537520,3538800," Like, I'm sorry."
3538800,3540000," Just a second."
3540000,3541360," Just like, I need to calm down."
3541360,3545920," So, this is going out of the window."
3545920,3554240," Okay."
3554240,3555280," Okay."
3555280,3556800," So, this is."
3556800,3558480," Uh-huh."
3558480,3559680," Uh-huh."
3559680,3570400," Uh-huh."
3570400,3571120," Uh-huh."
3571120,3580800," I think this is not needed."
3580800,3591520," How does that make any fucking sense?"
3591520,3591840," Like."
3591840,3595920," Like, why?"
3595920,3597920," Why would you design a system like that?"
3597920,3598640," Why?"
3598640,3600640," Why on earth would you do it like that?"
3600640,3601760," It's just so bad."
3601760,3607360," But, and of course, I'm being an ignorant idiot who didn't read documentation."
3610640,3612320," Fucking, it's so bad."
3612320,3615200," I'm sorry."
3615200,3615520," Okay."
3615520,3620720," And like, is it really my fault?"
3620720,3623920," Like, chat, tell me honestly."
3623920,3629520," Me having problems with this piece of software, really my fault?"
3629520,3632000," Yes, it is my fault."
3632000,3632320," Yeah."
3632320,3635920," It's just like, I don't even know what to tell."
3635920,3637040," Like, maybe it is my fault."
3637040,3643200," Maybe I am that dumb that I couldn't figure out the right order of arguments."
3643200,3648000," And the documentation is so goddamn obtuse."
3648000,3649200," It's just insane."
3649200,3650640," It's like, dude."
3650640,3653920," Oh, I'm sorry."
3653920,3659680," Like, it's just like, every time I work with it, I feel how I'm being unreasonable."
3659680,3663600," But at the same time, it's just like, is it me or is that the problem?"
3663600,3664080," I don't know."
3665600,3666240," Okay."
3666240,3668800," So, I think we're done with this entire thing."
3668800,3669040," Okay."
3669040,3670560," So, it can render some stuff."
3670560,3673760," But as you can see, it doesn't really finish processing."
3673760,3675040," Right."
3675040,3677840," So, it even generated some outwards and stuff like that."
3677840,3680000," So, it keeps doing this thing."
3680000,3680240," Right."
3680240,3681520," So, it keeps doing this thing."
3681520,3686320," So, and I think one of the things we have to do is close the pipe."
3686320,3688960," Close the pipe."
3688960,3689440," Right."
3689440,3694880," So, let's do write and then wait until it finishes and stuff like that."
3694880,3698080," And hopefully, it will generate a single frame."
3698080,3698400," Right."
3698400,3705520," So, and it seems to be, it generated as much video as there is a code in here."
3705520,3705760," Right."
3707040,3708800," So, let's actually take a look."
3708800,3709920," And did it work?"
3709920,3711280," We don't really know."
3711280,3716720," One of the things we probably want to do is maybe generate several frames."
3716720,3716960," Right."
3716960,3718400," So, who said we can't do that?"
3719120,3722800," So, we have FPS equal to 60."
3722800,3732400," So, maybe what we can do is essentially for this 60 iteration."
3732400,3732640," Right."
3732640,3736960," So, we can just like write this thing 60 times."
3736960,3737360," Right."
3737360,3739760," So, we can just write this thing 60 times."
3739760,3741840," And it generated like 4 kilobytes."
3741840,3742160," Right."
3742160,3744560," So, and there you go."
3744560,3748320," It was one second of red screen."
3750080,3752240," So, now we can do some interesting shit."
3752240,3754160," Right."
3754160,3756800," So, now we can do some interesting scheisse."
3756800,3763440," But before we do some interesting scheisse, I think I want to make a small break."
3763440,3764720," I want to make a cup of tea."
3764720,3768320," Because working with FFmPack was extremely stressful."
3768320,3770720," Was extremely fucking stressful."
3770720,3773760," You need to know the right combination of flags."
3773760,3776400," It's not enough to know the flag and what they mean."
3776400,3778880," You have to like put them in the right combination."
3778880,3781360," Because it's like a password."
3781360,3782000," You know?"
3782000,3784880," It's like a code that you have to sort of brute force."
3784880,3786400," And you put them in the right combination."
3786400,3788000," And then the log clicks."
3788000,3789040," And it opens up."
3789040,3790640," And it does exactly what you want."
3790640,3792640," You can't just put some flags in there."
3792640,3794560," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
3794560,3797440," There should be a special code and special combination."
3797920,3798640," So, yeah."
3798640,3801040," All right."
3801040,3802400," So, let's make a small break."
3802400,3802640," And..."
3802640,3807840," So, thank you so much."
3807840,3811680," Danny's board for tier 1 subscription."
3811680,3813840," With the message ""Atsodding appogging""."
3813840,3815600," I am appogging right now."
3815600,3817600," And Paykill1, thank you so much for tier 1."
3817600,3820160," With the message ""FFmPack, am I right?"""
3820160,3824960," Well, to be fair, the creator obviously put a lot of work into this thing."
3826400,3828160," And it is a very useful thing."
3828160,3830080," A very useful piece of software."
3830080,3832720," It's like a very influential piece of software."
3832720,3835200," But the way it's organized."
3835200,3835600," It's like..."
3835600,3836720," Man."
3836720,3838880," Jesus."
3838880,3842960," And I don't know if that's just generally the software rot."
3842960,3844000," Right?"
3844000,3847440," When the project becomes so big and so rotted."
3847440,3851440," That it's just like impossible to fix all of this problem."
3851440,3854160," Or it was intentionally just like misdesigned like that."
3854160,3855680," Like, it's really hard to tell."
3856400,3857360," It's like..."
3857360,3857920," I don't know."
3857920,3859840," And there is no thing that will replace it."
3859840,3860160," It's like..."
3860160,3864240," It falls into this like similar niches curl."
3864240,3865920," Right?"
3865920,3870960," So, it's like very annoying thing to work with."
3870960,3872480," But you just can't replace it."
3872480,3875280," Because it's like filled this like irreplaceable niches."
3875280,3877120," There's literally nothing you can do."
3877120,3879040," And that's why you have to just like suck it up."
3879040,3880160," You know what I mean?"
3880160,3882400," It's like for me, ffmpeg is a curl."
3882400,3884960," But for videos instead of http."
3884960,3887440," Or other like download protocols or something like that."
3887440,3892320," So, they kind of fall for me into the same like roughly niche."
3893520,3895920," Um, so."
3895920,3897520," Anyway."
3897520,3898800," So, let's actually do."
3898800,3903840," Yes, yes, yes."
3909760,3910320," Oh, right."
3910320,3911040," Let's make a break."
3911040,3911840," And you guys have fun."
3911840,3914480," All right."
3914480,3916320," So, let's try to animate this thing."
3916320,3916880," Right."
3916880,3919680," So, let's see what we can do."
3919680,3922080," We can actually use Olivettes."
3922080,3924400," I think we should be able to use Olivettes."
3924400,3925360," Let's go ahead and do that."
3925360,3927120," All right."
3930560,3935120," So, where is, by the way, for those who don't know, Olivettes is just like a very simple"
3935120,3937520," library that I developed quite some time ago."
3937520,3939760," You can find it in here if you're interested with groups."
3939760,3941120," Uh, right."
3941120,3945520," So, and for people who's watching on YouTube, I'm going to put that in the description."
3945520,3947520," Olivettes, uh, right."
3947520,3948560," I'm going to put that in here."
3948560,3957120," And, uh, so what it does, it basically allows you to render into the,"
3957120,3959200," into the chunk of memory that you allocated."
3959200,3959680," Right."
3959680,3961520," So, it's a fancy meme set."
3961520,3962080," Yeah."
3962080,3967200," Uh, so let's find, uh, Olivettes, uh, thingy."
3967200,3968640," Here, here it is."
3968640,3969360," Uh, there we go."
3969360,3974000," And let's take it to roll."
3974000,3977280," I love taking my libraries a roll."
3977280,3979440," Uh, control F roll."
3979440,3981840," Boom."
3981840,3983840," There we go."
3983840,3985200," We're going to download that."
3988000,3991040," that we get and just download that roll."
3991040,3996080," Uh, what we're going to do, we're going to include this entire thing, uh, Olivettes."
3996080,4000240," And we also need to enable implementation."
4000240,4002240," Um, there we go."
4002240,4008640," So, uh, let me actually recompile this entire thing just in case, just to see if I didn't introduce any"
4008640,4010960," focky walkie and potentially oopsie doopsie."
4010960,4015920," So the first thing we want to do, we want to construct the canvas out of the pixels that we allocated in the"
4015920,4016720," static memory."
4016720,4018640," So it's going to be a Olivettes canvas."
4018640,4020640," Uh, canvas."
4020640,4023200," Oh, see, Olivettes canvas."
4023200,4025200," Uh, pixels."
4025200,4026160," Width."
4026160,4027600," Height."
4027600,4030000," And width again, because this is a stride."
4030000,4031280," Uh, right."
4031280,4034000," And in here, we can do Olivettes fill."
4034000,4039440," And we're going to fill that with, uh, my favorite color, which is, uh, 18, 18, 18."
4039440,4039680," Right."
4039680,4040320," So this one."
4040320,4047440," Um, so, and then we can try to maybe, uh, render a circle."
4047440,4050080," We're going to render a circle at the center."
4050080,4050400," Right."
4050400,4054400," So it's going to be at width divided by two and height divided by two."
4054400,4058960," And in terms of, uh, radius, let's actually say that the radius is going to be dependent on the"
4058960,4060960," height and it's going to be a quarter of the height."
4060960,4062160," Uh, right."
4062160,4065120," And the color is going to be, uh, let's say red."
4065120,4065360," Right."
4065360,4066240," So that's the color."
4066240,4070880," And we just rendered a simple scene into the memory of the computer."
4070880,4071440," Uh, right."
4071440,4072880," And we don't need this kind of stuff."
4072880,4077840," And the next thing we can do, we can just like render that, uh, uh, like 60 frames of that."
4077840,4078000," Right."
4078000,4080320," We can try to render 60 frames of that."
4080320,4082640," So let's try to rebuild this entire thing."
4082640,4088240," And, uh, let's try to run this entire thing and see if it's going to do this stuff."
4088240,4089680," So it rendered something."
4089680,4089920," Right."
4089920,4090720," It rendered something."
4090720,4091760," Let's open this video."
4091760,4093680," Uh, yeah."
4093680,4095760," So that looked interesting."
4095760,4098640," Uh, so with one second is not too much."
4098640,4100800," Let's actually render it for longer."
4100800,4104320," Uh, let's maybe introduce something like duration."
4104320,4104560," Right."
4104560,4107040," And let's say that it's going to be five seconds."
4107040,4109760," And the duration is basically something like this."
4109760,4109920," Right."
4109920,4112400," So we're going to divide, uh, multiply it by 60."
4112400,4115360," And that way, uh, right."
4115360,4120800," So it's going to like render for a little bit longer, uh, five seconds of this stuff."
4122320,4123360," Uh, okay."
4123360,4125040," So let me open VLC."
4125040,4128400," And this is basically this thing for five seconds."
4128400,4129360," Isn't that amazing?"
4129360,4133200," That's, that's the peak of technology as the chat says."
4133200,4133600," Exactly."
4133600,4135120," That's the peak of technology."
4135120,4138480," I would like to actually reduce the radius, uh, for a little bit more."
4138480,4142000," Let's actually say this is going to be two seconds because it's, it's reduced for too long."
4142720,4144960," Uh, yeah, flag of Japan, dark theme."
4144960,4148800," Flag of Japan, dark theme."
4148800,4150000," Okay."
4150000,4154720," So, uh, let's actually make this entire thing moving, I suppose."
4154720,4155040," Right."
4155040,4156080," So let's make it moving."
4156080,4162720," One of the things I want to do, I would like to have width and height and FPS as the parameters."
4162720,4164160," Uh, right."
4164160,4166160," So we already have width and height as a parameters."
4166160,4167520," We don't have FPS in here."
4168000,4170960," Uh, but the problem here is that they're not synchronized."
4170960,4171120," Right."
4171120,4173280," So I want to be able to put this stuff in here."
4173280,4180800," Uh, so as far as I know, we can create like, um, stringify macro."
4181440,4181840," Right."
4181840,4188400," So in, um, in C, you can take any expression and sort of like stringify it, if you know what I mean."
4188400,4188960," Uh, right."
4188960,4192000," Because, uh, essentially there is a very interesting feature."
4192000,4198720," Uh, if inside of the macro substitution, you refer to the arguments as hash, the name of the argument,"
4198720,4200480," it will turn it into a string."
4200480,4201680," Uh, right."
4201680,4202720," So I'm going to show you."
4202720,4209280," So if we return zero in here, and we're going to try to print something like, uh, str FPS."
4209280,4209600," Right."
4209600,4210640," So let's give it a try."
4210640,4213680," Uh, it's going to give you like literally FPS."
4213680,4217600," But we want to actually render the value of FPS as a string."
4217600,4222080," For that, there is a very stupid hack, uh, right."
4222080,4226960," Uh, in C, you have to do that in two, uh, levels."
4226960,4230720," Basically you have to introduce str2, uh, that does that."
4230720,4234880," And inside of str, uh, you have to call str2."
4234880,4238720," You have to forward that thing one more layer and do it like that."
4238720,4243600," And only then it will take the value and render it, uh, like this."
4243600,4251280," So, yeah, this is because of this substitution bullshit stuff."
4251280,4252800," Uh, right."
4252800,4259120," And, uh, that will allow us to essentially take the FPS, which is a number."
4259120,4259760," Right."
4259760,4261600," And just like put it like this in here."
4261600,4262640," Right."
4262640,4264240," So, which is rather convenient."
4264240,4264480," Right."
4264480,4266560," So this will allow us to do this kind of stuff."
4266560,4270480," But the problem is that, um, in, in case of width and height,"
4270480,4274000," we have to combine them together into a single string literal."
4274800,4277200," And here we can use another C string."
4277200,4282240," We can use another C string where if you define a string literal like this,"
4282240,4286560," this is a single string literal."
4286560,4290560," You may think this is two string literals, but this is a single one."
4290560,4291440," Believe it or not."
4291440,4293520," This is a single one."
4293520,4297280," So let's actually go back to our experimentation."
4297280,4299040," And I'm going to do something like this."
4299040,4300480," And what if I do hello?"
4300480,4301360," Right."
4301360,4302560," What if I do hello?"
4302560,4303920," It will just print your hello."
4303920,4305840," But then you can literally put a space."
4305840,4307280," No comma."
4307280,4308800," Just space."
4308800,4311120," And it will print your hello world."
4311120,4314640," This is a valid C, by the way."
4314640,4318400," For, for those who never worked with C and C++ and stuff like that."
4318400,4319840," This is a valid C."
4319840,4321920," Perfectly valid C."
4321920,4325920," And this is because, uh, you, it allows you to have"
4325920,4332160," uh, a single string literal on several lines broken up like that."
4332160,4335600," this is still a single string literal."
4335600,4338720," This entire thing, a single string literal."
4338720,4339840," Believe it or not."
4339840,4344640," You may not like it, but this is a peak of syntax of programming."
4344640,4351200," Which actually allows you to do a pretty cool shit."
4352080,4355120," So essentially we can do a CR width, right?"
4355120,4357600," We can do a CR width."
4357600,4363280," But this thing from the point of view of the compiler is a string literal."
4363280,4368720," And since we can combine string literals like that, it allows me to do something like this."
4369440,4374480," And this is a single string literal known at compile time."
4374480,4380480," Without any memory allocation, without any concatenation or any bullshit."
4380480,4387920," I just construct a concatenation of two values known at compile time into another value known at compile time."
4388800,4390880," So that's basically what you can do here."
4390880,4392640," Yeah."
4392640,4401760," C is one of those languages where it seems to be simple on the surface."
4401760,4403680," It's, it's a very simple language."
4403680,4409920," But there's always something you discover about this motherfucker."
4409920,4410640," Like seriously."
4410640,4412400," It seems simple."
4412400,4414720," You can like program in it for decades."
4414720,4418320," And once in a while you're going to discover shit like that."
4418320,4420240," It's just like, you never stop learning."
4420240,4425040," Even though it's simple, it's just like always some new weird shit that pops up."
4425040,4427920," Right."
4427920,4430800," So, and it's not even C++."
4430800,4436000," I would understand that this would be C++ because you, you can learn C++ indefinitely."
4436000,4436560," Right."
4436560,4438400," So it's just like an infinite complexity."
4438400,4439440," This is pure C."
4439440,4440960," No bullshit."
4440960,4444960," And still you can just like discover some weird stuff about this language."
4444960,4452080," So, and this basically allows us to put this thing in here without any dynamic memory allocation."
4452080,4453040," It's quite important to remember."
4453040,4454560," No dynamic memory allocation."
4454560,4457840," This entire thing is literally constructed at compile time."
4457840,4460160," Right."
4461040,4462320," So that's what's interesting about this."
4462320,4468000," So that means if I at some point want to render at full HD, I can just do that."
4468000,4471440," So we can render at full HD in 2023."
4471440,4472800," So who said we cannot do that?"
4472800,4474400," We can do that."
4474400,4475920," This is going to be full HD."
4475920,4479600," And rendering five seconds of full HD is kind of difficult."
4479600,4481840," Especially when I'm streaming."
4481840,4483360," It's just like, right."
4483360,4485120," So let me see."
4485120,4487680," Yeah."
4487680,4488560," This is full HD."
4488560,4492560," High definition circle."
4492560,4495440," That's absolutely poggers."
4495440,4497040," Anyways."
4497040,4501360," So let's actually define the position of the circle."
4501360,4501600," Right."
4501600,4503280," So let's define the position of the circle."
4503280,4508160," The circle is going to be positioned at X, which is width divided by 2."
4508160,4510480," And Y, which is height divided by 2."
4510480,4516480," And we probably want to render each individual frame on each iteration as we just, you know,"
4517040,4518560," feed them into FFM pack."
4518560,4519280," Right."
4519280,4524160," And every time we render them, we want to be using the current position."
4524160,4527200," So this could be actually extracted into a radius."
4527200,4527360," Right."
4527360,4529280," So we can put it as a radius in here."
4529280,4529760," There we go."
4529760,4535840," And we probably want to introduce the velocity of the circle where it is moving."
4535840,4540560," Let's say it's going to be moving at 100 by X and 100 by Y."
4540560,4540800," Right."
4540800,4546640," So if we want to animate all of that properly, we need to know delta time."
4546640,4547360," Right."
4547360,4549200," So since we know FPS."
4549200,4549440," Right."
4549440,4552880," So we can quite easily compute the delta time based on the FPS."
4552880,4557360," So, and every time we render everything, we want to update the position of the circle."
4557360,4560080," Basically add dx."
4560080,4560400," Right."
4560400,4561680," But multiply it by dt."
4561680,4565440," So, uh, divided dt."
4565440,4570000," So, and that will essentially move it by like diagonally and stuff like that."
4570000,4571840," So let's try to render this entire thing."
4571840,4574400," Uh, and see if it's going to work."
4574400,4576240," So we probably want to reduce the resolution"
4576240,4580560," because 60 FPS at full HD when I'm streaming as well."
4580560,4584080," See, it's kind of, it's kind of difficult for the city."
4584080,4584720," I think so."
4584720,4587280," Uh, but it's supposed to be moving."
4587280,4588080," It's supposed, yeah."
4588080,4588960," And it is moving."
4588960,4590960," So, it's cool."
4590960,4593600," It's pretty cool."
4593600,4594480," Uh, okay."
4594480,4597840," So let me reduce the resolution by this."
4597840,4600880," And maybe I want to reduce the FPS to make it a little bit faster."
4600880,4604080," That should allow me to have a higher duration."
4604080,4605120," What about 10 seconds?"
4605120,4607440," I'm pretty sure I'll be able to manage to render 10 seconds."
4607440,4609760," So we see that stuff relatively quickly."
4609760,4612800," Now, even 10 seconds is a little bit difficult for this thing to do."
4612800,4619760," Uh, so it seems to be, yeah, it actually generated more, I think."
4619760,4620720," But maybe, I don't know."
4620720,4622800," Let me see."
4622800,4624000," Oh, it was 20 seconds."
4624640,4630400," Ah, this is because I'm referring to FPS here directly."
4630400,4634400," So this is the danger of hard-coded magical numbers."
4634400,4636400," Right."
4636400,4637920," So we're going to do FPS."
4637920,4644080," All right."
4644080,4646080," So let me see."
4646080,4648160," Okay."
4648160,4653440," So that should be faster because we're rendering precisely 10 seconds."
4655440,4655760," Okay."
4655760,4660320," So let's quickly make it bounce, uh, like off of the walls."
4660320,4662000," So that should be pretty straightforward."
4662000,4662240," Right."
4662240,4665840," So instead of, uh, like straight up adding this entire thing,"
4665840,4669360," what we're going to do, we're going to save it into an intermediate variable."
4669360,4669680," Right."
4669680,4672320," So we're going to save it into an intermediate variable."
4672320,4675440," And one of the things we want to check in here, if, uh, it is"
4675440,4678160," within the boundaries, right?"
4678160,4681840," If it's greater than zero and, uh, less than width,"
4681840,4684080," that means it's a valid next value."
4684080,4688560," And we're going to assign, uh, assign it to the current thing."
4688560,4690320," If it's not a valid, right?"
4690320,4696240," If it overflows like left or right, instead of like assigning and committing to that value,"
4696240,4698320," we're going to be basically inverting the X."
4698320,4699200," Right."
4699200,4699600," There we go."
4699600,4702560," So basically we try to step in that direction."
4702560,4704160," If we can't go there, right?"
4704160,4707200," Because we like reached the wall, uh, we're not going to go there."
4707200,4712640," We're going to invert this, uh, velocity and try in the different direction on the next iteration."
4712640,4714720," So that's basically how we bounce off of the wall."
4714720,4715680," Uh, right."
4715680,4720320," And this thing kind of implies that the, um, the circle is going to go off of the,"
4720320,4721840," like out of bounds."
4721840,4724480," And it's only the center that is going to bounce."
4724480,4727760," So usually it's countered by subtracting the radius."
4727760,4728000," Right."
4728000,4731360," So we're going to subtract the radius in here and add the radius in here."
4731360,4735200," And we repeat the same thing for Y as well."
4735200,4736320," Literally the same thing."
4736320,4737600," Right."
4737600,4740720," If it's less than Y and Y less than height."
4740720,4741840," Uh, right."
4741840,4744800," So here I want to subtract R or add R."
4744800,4749200," And if everything's okay, I just commit to that specific, uh, position."
4749200,4753680," Otherwise I just don't do anything, only invert the velocity."
4753680,4754320," Right."
4754320,4760480," So, and maybe I want to render for, uh, let's say, I think maybe 10 seconds"
4760480,4763440," is going to be fine, but let's make it a little bit faster, like twice as fast."
4763440,4766400," So this is going to be too, there we go."
4766400,4769120," Because we want to see how it's going to bounce off of those things."
4769120,4774000," All right."
4774000,4778400," So, uh, yep, it is bouncing."
4778400,4781840," I'm not sure how well you can see that, but it is bouncing over the walls."
4781840,4783680," Yeah."
4783680,4785600," And that's the video we generated."
4785600,4788160," It's 10 seconds of this thing bouncing around."
4788160,4790080," So that's pretty cool."
4790080,4794720," So that means we have the technology to render the videos."
4794720,4796800," We have the technology."
4796800,4801200," So the only thing that we need to do with that technology is to merge"
4801200,4804160," it with the neural networks."
4804160,4804480," Right."
4804480,4809360," So now we have to go and just like generate a video out of the neural network."
4809360,4811440," So we'll go ahead and do that."
4811440,4816720," So let's go to the, I definitely need to save this specific project."
4816720,4817600," Right."
4817600,4823520," Because, um, yeah, I want to be able to people to reproduce this entire stuff without fighting with"
4823520,4824640," FFmpeg flags."
4824640,4826320," Right."
4826320,4829360," So yeah, let me actually quickly do that right away."
4829360,4832800," So I'm going to create it under MIT license."
4832800,4835040," You can do whatever the fuck you want with it."
4835040,4836480," I'm going to put a readme in here."
4836480,4839120," So in terms of readme, what we're going to have."
4839120,4840720," So how are we going to call this kind of thing?"
4842080,4850240," So rendering a video in C with FFmpeg."
4850240,4851120," Right."
4851120,4852400," With the FFmpeg."
4852400,4856880," So in the quick start is essentially, uh, so console."
4856880,4862240," So you just build this entire thing, build this entire thing, and you just run this entire thing."
4862240,4862720," There we go."
4862720,4864640," So yep."
4864640,4864800," Yep."
4864800,4865360," Yep."
4865360,4867040," And then you can customize all of that."
4867040,4868800," So the whole program is very simple."
4868800,4874240," So it's very obvious, like what you can change in here, how to customize all of that and everything."
4874240,4880480," So, uh, yes, uh, maybe I want to git ignore something."
4880480,4882560," So I'm going to definitely git ignore mp4."
4882560,4883200," Right."
4883200,4885200," And another thing we're going to ignore is main."
4885200,4886960," Uh, right."
4886960,4890000," And let's do git init, like so."
4890000,4892560," And let's do a committee committee."
4892560,4897200," So, uh, ready, set a go."
4897200,4902720," So the only question is, um, how do we want to call this entire thing?"
4902720,4904480," So what would be a good name?"
4904480,4909280," Uh, rendering video with C, uh, in C with FFmpeg."
4909280,4915280," So we can just like literally call the whole project like that because I don't plan, uh,"
4915280,4918240," this thing to have like a catch a name or anything like that."
4918240,4924880," I plan this thing to be just an example that people can copy paste and start building their own stuff on top."
4924880,4926960," off, uh, how do I English?"
4926960,4927440," I don't know."
4927440,4930080," Uh, so I'm going to just give it very explicit name."
4930080,4935120," Rendering video, uh, in C with FFmpeg."
4935120,4935360," Right."
4935360,4938240," So that's going to be literally the name of this entire thing."
4938240,4941040," And let's create a repo for this entire stuff."
4941040,4946320," Because also it will make it easier for people to Google up this thing."
4946320,4946880," Right."
4946880,4952080," So, because somebody may want to know like, how do I do specifically that?"
4952080,4955920," And it's going to match the keywords that we put in the name and it's going to be actually helpful."
4955920,4956160," Right."
4956160,4958480," So, uh, no bullshit."
4958480,4960160," Right."
4960160,4964720," So that's why I don't want to give it like a sort of like catch a name or anything like that."
4964720,4966560," Uh, right."
4966560,4971200," So I think it's useful for that specific case."
4971200,4973520," Uh, right."
4973520,4974800," So this is going to be public."
4980800,4981360," All righty."
4981360,4985360," So let's copy paste it."
4985360,4988400," And it's going to be useful for me in the future as well, by the way, speaking of."
4988400,4989920," All right."
4989920,4992880," Maybe at some point I want to be able to do that again."
4992880,4996560," And I don't want to be fighting with the FFmpeg flags again."
4996560,4996880," Right."
4996880,5000400," I want to solve that problem once and for all and forget about it."
5000400,5003040," Especially in this specific case, because when I'm rendering these things,"
5003040,5008320," uh, what I want is just to like inspect something."
5008320,5008640," Right."
5008640,5012080," Some algorithm or some other things or whatnot."
5012080,5012320," Right."
5012320,5016080," So I don't really need a very specific video format or anything like that."
5016080,5016320," Right."
5016320,5017680," I'm going to copy paste it in the chat."
5017680,5021360," And for people who's watching on YouTube, I'm going to put it in here."
5021360,5021600," Right."
5021600,5026240," So this is how you can render a video and see with FFmpeg if you ever wanted to do that."
5026240,5027200," Right."
5027200,5032000," So that's a very like a simple proof of concept that you can just compile and play with."
5032000,5033920," And there you go."
5033920,5034240," All right."
5034240,5037040," So what we need to do, what we need to do,"
5037760,5042880," We need to, um, integrate all of that into our neural network thing."
5042880,5043120," Right."
5043120,5050560," So let me go to nn.h and in here, uh, I suppose I'm going to start copy pasting."
5050560,5050800," Okay."
5050800,5056800," Uh, so we probably want to generate a video when we press a key."
5056800,5056960," Right."
5056960,5058240," So we have a section in here."
5058240,5062000," When, uh, we press space, it just toggles the pause."
5062000,5065120," When we press R, it resets the training of this entire thing."
5065120,5072560," When we press S, it creates a screenshot of upscaled version, uh, which is actually pretty big amount of code."
5072560,5074480," So maybe I want to factor that out."
5074480,5074960," Uh, right."
5074960,5077040," And we're going to have something like is key."
5077040,5082160," Uh, what, what kind of key we're going to assign to rendering the, uh, this entire thing."
5082160,5084880," So maybe it's going to be X or something like that."
5084880,5085200," Right."
5085200,5087280," So maybe something, something like X."
5087280,5094080," So, uh, and then we can say render, uh, upscaled video, right."
5094080,5095200," Render upscaled video."
5095200,5098000," And we will need to just implement this function."
5098000,5101280," This function is probably going to accept the neural network itself."
5101280,5101600," Right."
5101600,5103520," And, uh, we'll see."
5103520,5105440," Maybe it will need more parameters in here."
5105440,5108800," But for now, it's just, it's going to accept just the neural network."
5108800,5110400," Uh, right."
5110400,5112640," So it's just N, N, N, there we go."
5112640,5120960," So, uh, and, uh, so I also want you to factor out creating this screenshot."
5121440,5121760," Right."
5121760,5130640," Render upscaled, um, screenshots."
5130640,5133200," Right."
5133200,5135280," So we're probably going to, uh, provide N, N."
5135280,5143520," Uh, and let me factor out this thing in here to render upscaled screenshots."
5143520,5144160," Super quick."
5144160,5149280," Uh, yeah, I think I can, you can just do it like that."
5149280,5151120," So I'm not sure if it's going to work."
5151120,5151360," Right."
5151360,5155120," So I'm not sure it's going to work, but I'm going to just go through the compilation errors and,"
5155120,5157520," uh, fix everything."
5157520,5160000," Right."
5160000,5162720," So, uh, let me rebuild this entire stuff."
5162720,5164240," So probably also want to do."
5164240,5170080," This is going to be the dot."
5170080,5171120," So let's see."
5171120,5173520," So probably don't want to build everything."
5173520,5173760," Right."
5173760,5175440," So let's not build everything."
5175440,5177920," Let's comment out some of these things."
5177920,5180000," So I hope it's not going to bite me in the ass."
5180000,5184560," Uh, so here we have to provide out width and out height."
5184560,5184880," Right."
5184880,5187600," So this is out width and out height."
5187600,5189280," So I provided them in here."
5189280,5189600," All right."
5189600,5191760," So this is out width and out height."
5191760,5195040," And I also constructed this entire thing."
5195040,5201200," So what I'm thinking is that maybe I need to put that stuff into the static memory,"
5201200,5202240," if you know what I mean."
5202240,5202560," Right."
5202560,5207360," So I think it should be, yeah, it should be in a static memory because I want to, I want"
5207360,5208960," this thing to be available like everywhere."
5208960,5212080," So out width and out height."
5212080,5216480," And here we can just simply construct something like this."
5216480,5216800," Right."
5216800,5222320," So it's going to be out width multiplied by out height."
5222320,5230320," So the main problem in here is that, uh, it accepts you in eight instead of you in 32."
5230320,5230560," Right."
5230560,5235040," So that means we'll have to, yeah, we'll have to do something about that."
5235040,5241840," So, uh, and I'm definitely going to be reusing this buffer for apps, uh, render upscale video too."
5241840,5242160," Right."
5242160,5246400," So since basically these two functions do the same thing."
5246400,5250800," It's just the upscale video does the screenshot multiple times."
5250800,5252400," If you know what I mean."
5252400,5253520," Right."
5253520,5256640," So, uh, yeah."
5256640,5257760," So let's go ahead and do that."
5257760,5260960," So here, uh, you cannot construct it like that."
5260960,5263680," So, which means that this thing has to be a macro."
5263680,5265120," Uh, right."
5265120,5266800," It has to be known at compile time."
5266800,5269760," So let's make it known at compile time."
5269760,5270320," Sure."
5270320,5271120," I don't mind that."
5271120,5273680," So, uh, what do we have in here?"
5273680,5274400," Expected."
5274400,5277280," Uh, what?"
5277280,5278240," Oh, this is because."
5278240,5280560," God damn C."
5280560,5281440," God damn C."
5281440,5282400," What can I say?"
5282400,5282720," Okay."
5282720,5287440," So here we have to accept the NN, the neural network that we're currently rendering."
5287440,5289600," What else do we want in here?"
5289600,5290880," Okay."
5290880,5294880," So here it may fail, by the way."
5294880,5295120," Right."
5295120,5295760," It may fail."
5295760,5297200," So we have to return integer."
5297200,5299200," There we go."
5299200,5300480," And here it's going to be zero."
5300480,5303200," So I suppose if it failed."
5303200,5304160," All right."
5304160,5304880," If it failed."
5304880,5306880," We probably want to."
5306880,5311520," Return one here as well."
5311520,5313440," Right."
5313440,5314080," So here."
5314080,5317360," In case of success, it returns zero."
5317360,5318400," Right."
5318400,5319600," Um, otherwise."
5319600,5319840," Yeah."
5319840,5322160," So essentially we want to probably chain that."
5322160,5322400," Right."
5322400,5325360," So this thing basically logs everything."
5325360,5327040," So we don't have to do that."
5327040,5328320," So image file path."
5328320,5332160," So do we want this login?"
5332160,5333280," I don't think we want this login."
5333280,5336800," This login was introduced at the beginning of the development of this thing."
5336800,5338400," Um, right."
5338400,5342560," So, and it's not really relevant because we actually generate from two images."
5342560,5344480," In the future, we may have several of them."
5344480,5347920," So this login is not particularly relevant anymore, in my opinion."
5347920,5354080," Uh, so here we also do upscaled PNG, which could have been also maybe provided in here."
5354640,5358160," Uh, const char out file path."
5358160,5358560," Right."
5358560,5361120," So then we don't really have to do that."
5361120,5364240," Uh, though in, in, in terms of generating, by the way,"
5364240,5368960," we could have said something like a generated as, uh, which is out file path."
5368960,5369280," Right."
5369280,5371360," So that's one of the things we could have done."
5371360,5375840," So, and in here we have to say upscaled, uh, upscaled PNG."
5375840,5378240," Seems good."
5378240,5379120," Seems Gucci."
5379120,5380640," Seems a Tamaguchi."
5380640,5381760," So we've got some subs."
5381760,5383120," Let me quickly acknowledge them."
5383760,5386320," Uh, so walk TV."
5386320,5387120," Thank you so much."
5387120,5387680," Walk TV."
5387680,5389440," I suppose that's how we're supposed to pronounce it."
5389440,5390560," Thank you so much for Twitch Prime."
5390560,5390800," Thank you."
5390800,5390960," Thank you."
5390960,5391600," Thank you."
5391600,5392320," Uh, all right."
5392320,5394080," Okay."
5394080,5399040," So, uh, now everything seems to be okay."
5399040,5400480," Everything seems to be working."
5400480,5406000," The only thing we need to implement now is, uh, upscaled video, render upscaled video."
5406000,5408880," So let's literally copy paste our solution."
5408880,5409200," Right."
5409200,5411680," So we're going to be creating FD."
5411680,5413040," This one is rather interesting."
5413040,5421120," Um, we could, at the end of the rendering, we close both of the ends of the pipe."
5421120,5424800," So everything seems to be like finished, right?"
5424800,5426560," No cleanup is required in here."
5426560,5426800," Okay."
5426800,5432000," So I suppose for this entire thing, I can just copy paste this entire stuff."
5432000,5432240," Right."
5432240,5434080," So we just copy paste it in here."
5434080,5435840," Then we're going to have some rendering in here."
5435840,5437840," I'm not going to copy paste anything yet."
5438480,5442880," Then after that, we're closing this entire thing, right?"
5442880,5450320," So to do render the, uh, neural, neural net, right?"
5450320,5452160," So this is where we're going to be rendering all of that."
5452160,5458320," So, and here we want to say something like generated, uh, s, right?"
5458320,5460160," Which is going to be out file path."
5460160,5463760," And we're going to accept that out file path in here, right?"
5463760,5464640," Out file path."
5464640,5472080," And we can even put it in here, uh, out file path as we generate this thing."
5472080,5473040," Okay."
5473040,5477360," This one is a little bit, uh, annoying in my opinion."
5477360,5485440," This one is a little bit annoying."
5485440,5490560," All right."
5490560,5497520," So, uh, there is a problem as already said that, uh, we have single byte pixels, right?"
5497520,5500480," But we have, but we want to render with 32."
5501440,5504960," So, you know what I want to do since it's an output, right?"
5504960,5510720," Since it's an output, uh, we can actually just switch to 32, right?"
5510720,5512800," That will break a screenshot."
5512800,5517040," But in case of a screenshot, we'll, when we're rendering this entire thing,"
5517040,5522320," when we're rendering this entire thing, we'll have to, uh, construct the pixel properly."
5522320,5523360," How can we construct it?"
5523360,5528400," So we can say that this is going to be the brightness and then, uh, bright"
5530240,5536080," and the actual pixel in here is essentially, well,"
5536080,5543200," so this has to be 32."
5543200,5545120," Okay."
5545120,5548320," So there is some problem in here."
5548320,5552080," This value, this is the output from the neural network, right?"
5552080,5558800," So we basically made a very wild assumption in here that is going to be zero or from zero to one,"
5558800,5560160," which is not 100% true."
5560160,5565440," It could be, well, to be fair, it's kind of true because we're using sigmoid and sigmoid ensures"
5565440,5566800," that it's from zero to one."
5566800,5569840," But if we change the activation function, this assumption will break."
5569840,5572080," So we have to be super careful with here."
5572080,5574880," So this is, uh, activation, right?"
5574880,5576800," So this is basically an activation."
5576800,5578160," Right."
5578160,5583760," And what we want to do, we want to make sure that the activation is between the, uh, zero and one"
5583760,5585200," for, for this specific case."
5585200,5585520," Right."
5585520,5586240," So at least."
5586240,5588800," So, uh, we want to clamp it."
5588800,5592720," If it's less than zero, we're going to say it's one, it's zero, sorry."
5593360,5597440," And if it's greater than zero, greater than one is going to be one."
5597440,5599920," So we just basically clamp this into anything like so."
5599920,5605120," And only then it is super safe to, uh, do something like this, right?"
5605760,5608800," And it's not going to overflow 255."
5608800,5613760," So after that, we have to construct a pixel and the pixel is going to be FF000."
5613760,5617920," So basically we set up the alpha to be just 255."
5617920,5623760," And then what we have to do is just bright, um, just like this."
5623760,5625680," So this is going to be the red thing."
5625680,5629440," And then, uh, I suppose we need to combine it with green."
5629440,5633200," And then the last one is going to be 16."
5634160,5634720," Right."
5634720,5637920," So something like this, that's probably what we want to do in here."
5637920,5641600," Uh, and that way it's going to be the thing."
5641600,5646160," What's interesting is that this is the code that we can reuse for both,"
5646160,5650240," uh, render upscale screenshot and render video."
5650240,5650480," Yeah."
5650480,5655520," Because as I said, it's, uh, rendering video is basically rendering screenshots,"
5655520,5658800," uh, but, uh, 60 times per second."
5658800,5659040," Right."
5659040,5662960," So we may want to factor out this thing."
5662960,5667360," So what this thing does, it actually iterates through all the pixels of the output"
5667360,5672640," and asks the neural network, what, what's the brightness of that pixel."
5672640,5672960," Right."
5672960,5674240," And puts it into the image."
5674240,5674480," Right."
5674480,5678480," So it renders the single frame out of the, out of the neural network."
5678480,5681440," It extracts the frame out of the neural network."
5681440,5682160," Right."
5682160,5685680," Is there already capability to save the train model?"
5685680,5687600," No, not really, but it's super easy to implement."
5687600,5694240," And so I just don't really rush into implementing it right now because I don't really need that,"
5694240,5697440," to be fair, but it will be kind of useful to have."
5697440,5704080," Uh, so because essentially you may pre-train some model and you may want to save it and then load it"
5704080,5707840," up and continue training, maybe even on the different data."
5707840,5710800," And I think this is called pretty, uh, like fine tuning, isn't it?"
5710800,5712080," Right."
5712080,5718640," So when you train the model and then you want to specialize that model on some very specific data."
5718640,5718880," Right."
5718880,5723040," So you take pre-trained model and continue training it, but in a different direction slightly."
5723040,5726480," So yeah, that would be useful for that specifically."
5726480,5737920," So maybe we can try to like, you can pre-train model to interpolate from one image to another,"
5737920,5745920," and then you can take that model and train it, uh, to have a very specific in-between frame at 0.5."
5746800,5752320," So fine tune it to be like that, uh, which is, which is an interesting idea actually."
5752320,5761360," Uh, so we've got some subs, uh, thank you so much, Nick, uh, k-y-r."
5761360,5762960," Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hot Witch Prime."
5762960,5771760," Uh, hello. Hello, me, meezy, meezy. Uh, so there we go."
5771760,5773440," All right."
5773440,5775680," So let's actually factor this thing out."
5776160,5786720," Let's actually factor this thing out and it can say something like, uh, render, uh, single out, uh, frame or maybe out image."
5786720,5787440," Right."
5787440,5793440," So, and then here we're going to accept the neural network and, uh, let's just simply copy paste this thing in here."
5793440,5798720," But we also have to accept the value of the interpolator."
5798720,5802000," So here it's called, uh, scroll, uh, right."
5802000,5805840," Let's actually call it something like float a, right."
5805840,5807280," I don't know how to properly call that."
5807280,5816160," But anyway, so when we are doing the screenshots, uh, we want to render, uh, we want to render whatever we have on the scroll."
5816160,5818880," The value of the scroll thingy, right."
5818880,5821040," The value of all the scroll thingy."
5821040,5826720," So we just render it once and then we are saving those pixels into PNG and everyone is happy."
5826720,5832960," In case of the video, we want to be constantly calling to this function, right."
5832960,5836400," To this function with a different A, with a different interpolator."
5836400,5837920," Uh, right."
5837920,5839760," So that's what we want to be able to do."
5839760,5841840," Uh, all right."
5842240,5844720," So here we started this entire thing."
5844720,5849440," The real question is going to be what's going to be the duration in seconds."
5849440,5853280," Uh, we can accept the duration in here."
5853280,5855120," Duration."
5855120,5856960," And it's going to be float, right."
5856960,5862480," Um, so that means we need to create like a frame count, right."
5862480,5866400," So we're going to have a frame count, which is basically FPS multiplied by duration."
5866400,5869040," But then we have to truncate this entire thing."
5869040,5873280," But I think, uh, converting from flow to size T is going to truncate that automatically."
5873280,5880960," So anyway, uh, then we want to, um, just iterate through each individual frame, right."
5880960,5883760," So this is going to be frame count."
5883760,5888160," And what's going to be the A for that specific frame, right."
5888160,5889040," What's going to be the A?"
5889040,5896800," Well, it is going to be essentially frame count divided, um, I divided by frame count, right."
5896800,5898400," So we interpolate them from zero to one."
5898400,5901680," Uh, so here maybe we want to actually do a float in here."
5901680,5906160," Uh, so there's a little bit back and forth conversion between integers and floats in here."
5906160,5913440," So maybe it would be nice to have a float in here, but we then need this thing to be,"
5913440,5914800," it's, it's kind of weird."
5914800,5916560," So I think I'm going to keep it like that."
5917280,5917680," Right."
5917680,5924960," So then what we want to do, we want to render, um, not really that, but we want to render a single"
5924960,5928480," out, uh, image, right."
5928480,5932160," So let's put it in here, but it has to be A."
5932160,5934560," And I didn't think we need A for anything else."
5934560,5938880," So I think I could probably inline it for more expressiveness."
5938880,5945920," And after we render this entire thing, what we have to do, we have to save that thing into the"
5945920,5947120," right pipe, right."
5947120,5954240," So we're going to be doing out pixels, size of out pixels multiplied by, um, we can do it like that."
5954240,5956640," Out width and out height."
5956640,5957760," There we go."
5958480,5961280," And that's it, believe it or not, that's the entire thing, right."
5961280,5965280," Since we actually factored out the code that renders the frame,"
5965280,5967680," we can just reuse that code in both of the places."
5967680,5970240," And that should be enough, I think."
5970240,5972240," So this is that."
5972240,5977200," Uh, this one is a little bit focky wocky, that's for sure."
5977200,5985680," Because, um, here we have to use out width and out height."
5986480,5987280," Uh, okay."
5987280,5992720," So in case of FPS, it may work because FP, wait a second."
5992720,5995200," Out width and out height are already compiled."
5995200,5995840," It will work."
5995840,5997760," It fucking will work."
5997760,5998080," Okay."
5998080,6000240," So I thought there, there are runtime values."
6000240,6001600," So they already compiled time values."
6001600,6001840," Okay."
6001840,6002400," So that's fine."
6002400,6006640," Uh, so the, the only thing we need in here is just this bullshit."
6006640,6006880," Right."
6006880,6008240," So let's actually bring it here."
6008240,6015600," Uh, and, uh, so this is going to be, uh, 30 FPS, which is fine, I guess, uh, which is fine."
6015600,6018000," Let's try to build this entire thing and go through the compilation area."
6018000,6019200," Uh, okay."
6019200,6023840," So this is the pixel, uh, and what you don't like."
6023840,6025280," And oh, it's unused."
6025280,6026000," Thank you so much."
6026000,6029200," Compiler actually found an, an, an error."
6029200,6032640," And now we have to bring in all of the POSIX bullshit in here."
6032640,6032880," Right."
6032880,6036560," So we need to include all of these flags in here, right."
6036560,6041040," Because they're important, which makes this entire thing uncompilable on windows."
6041040,6044320," And maybe I'll have to put some flags in here."
6044320,6044640," All right."
6044640,6045200," Essentially."
6045200,6047600," If you're on windows, just don't include that feature."
6047600,6049840," Uh, that would have been useful, I think."
6049840,6051200," Uh, right."
6051200,6052160," So what do we have in here?"
6052160,6052880," Error no."
6052880,6054960," So that means I need to include error."
6054960,6055200," No."
6055200,6056560," And maybe even string."
6056560,6056880," Right."
6056880,6058160," Some stuff like this."
6058160,6059360," What else do we have in here?"
6059360,6060080," Return one."
6060080,6060320," Okay."
6060320,6061680," So this entire thing may fail."
6061680,6063040," Uh, right."
6063040,6064640," Do we even call this thing?"
6064640,6064880," Yeah."
6064880,6066000," We call it in here."
6066000,6066320," Right."
6066320,6066560," So."
6066560,6068560," Return one."
6068560,6069680," If it failed rendering."
6069680,6071440," Though to be fair."
6071440,6073120," You know what?"
6073120,6075680," If it failed the rendering."
6075680,6077760," Do we really want to crash the entire thing?"
6077760,6081040," I think it's not reasonable to crash this entire thing."
6081040,6082640," Let's actually ignore the server."
6082640,6084800," We have an opportunity to catch it."
6084800,6087040," But I don't think it makes sense to do anything there."
6087040,6089520," So read end and write end."
6089520,6092160," Let's actually bring these things here as well."
6092960,6093920," Uh, right."
6093920,6096160," So all of these macros that we developed in here."
6096160,6100000," We're slowly integrating whatever we wrote into the into the thing."
6100000,6102000," So too few arguments."
6102000,6102240," Okay."
6102240,6104240," So single out image."
6104240,6104800," Right."
6104800,6108160," And you're supposed to provide also a neural network."
6108160,6108320," Right."
6108320,6110320," So I provided only interpolator."
6110320,6112560," But you're also supposed to provide neural network."
6112560,6114320," What else do we have in here?"
6114320,6116080," So here we have to return zero."
6116080,6118560," What's the next error?"
6118560,6120640," Render single."
6120640,6120880," Yeah."
6120880,6122000," That makes sense."
6122000,6122480," What else?"
6122960,6123600," Uh-huh."
6123600,6125280," Okay."
6125280,6126880," So upscale video."
6126880,6128160," So what do we provide in here?"
6128160,6130480," We provide the duration and output."
6130480,6132400," So we want to play the animation."
6132400,6134800," For how long we want to play the animation?"
6134800,6137360," So I think five seconds maybe is going to be all right."
6137360,6138160," Right."
6138160,6139120," So five seconds."
6139120,6140560," Let's say five seconds."
6140560,6142880," And output is going to be upscaled mp4."
6142880,6143120," Right."
6143120,6145120," As you can see, in case of the screenshot,"
6145120,6146640," we do upscale png."
6146640,6149440," In case of the video, we do upscale mp4."
6149440,6150480," All right."
6150480,6152320," So that makes sense as well."
6152320,6157200," I guess it worked."
6157200,6157440," Okay."
6157440,6160560," So let's try to run it and see how miserably it fails."
6160560,6160880," Right."
6160880,6164000," So where is my mnist database?"
6164000,6166000," Mnist database."
6166000,6169200," Mnist database."
6169200,6173440," I think I want to actually interpolate from eight to six."
6174240,6174560," All right."
6174560,6175760," So training six."
6175760,6178320," Okay."
6178320,6178800," Go."
6178800,6180080," Let's keep training."
6180080,6181920," Let's train this mother flipper."
6181920,6182560," Okay."
6182560,6183840," So it is training."
6183840,6185040," It is framing."
6185040,6186320," Okay."
6186320,6187440," So it's going a little bit crazy."
6187440,6191680," I'm going to reduce the rate at which it is training."
6191680,6194480," So I don't like this part."
6194480,6194800," Right."
6194800,6197440," It's a little bit under trained, I would say."
6197440,6200960," I would let it train a little bit more."
6200960,6201200," Okay."
6201200,6202560," Let's take a look at S."
6203680,6204000," All right."
6204000,6205360," So upscale PNG."
6205360,6207840," What the fuck is this choice?"
6207840,6210400," I think I know what the fuck is this choice."
6210400,6212640," So screen."
6212640,6214960," And we already found a miserably failed thing."
6214960,6216960," So screenshot."
6216960,6220000," Where is a screenshot?"
6220000,6220720," I think I know."
6220720,6222640," Yeah."
6222640,6229520," Though."
6231840,6235280," The amount of components has to be four, I suppose."
6235280,6235520," Right."
6235520,6243360," So here we provide out without height, the pixels, the amount of components, the pixels and the stride."
6243360,6245760," So that's basically the main problem in here."
6245760,6248880," So let me double check that by going into third party image."
6248880,6249600," Right."
6249600,6251120," And I just want to see the signature."
6251120,6251280," Yeah."
6251280,6252320," It's amount of components."
6252320,6252640," It's okay."
6252640,6254160," So we found a bug."
6254160,6254960," That was important."
6254960,6256160," I believe."
6256160,6256560," All right."
6256560,6258800," So let's try to recompile that one more time."
6258800,6261440," One more time."
6261440,6262000," Oh, Provot."
6262000,6262480," What's up?"
6262480,6263600," What's up?"
6263600,6264000," What's up?"
6264000,6265840," Hello, Mr. Provot."
6265840,6266720," How are you doing?"
6266720,6267760," I'm not sure if you're still watching."
6267760,6269040," Maybe you just rated me and left."
6269600,6270560," But hello, hello."
6270560,6271200," Really glad to see you."
6271200,6273840," So we're training some neural networks."
6273840,6274880," That's right."
6274880,6279760," I'm just like training neural network that is going to steal my job."
6279760,6280080," Right."
6280080,6281120," So I'm a streamer."
6281120,6284000," This neural network is going to generate streams for me."
6284000,6286320," Actually, it's not going to take my job."
6286320,6287680," It's going to do the job for me."
6287680,6287920," Right."
6287920,6289840," So because I own the neural network."
6289840,6290720," So that's even better."
6292480,6295680," Let me just do a screenshot just to see what the fuck is going on."
6295680,6297120," So where is upscale?"
6297120,6297440," Shit."
6297440,6298800," That looks good."
6298800,6299360," That looks good."
6299360,6300960," That's precisely what I want you to see."
6300960,6305760," Let's reduce the training rate because it's going too fucking crazy, mate."
6305760,6306640," Right."
6306640,6306960," Yeah."
6306960,6307200," Yeah."
6307200,6311520," I'm manually adjusting the learning rates."
6311520,6316320," I'm training this shit manually."
6316320,6316640," Right."
6316640,6317920," With my bare hands."
6317920,6319360," Okay."
6319360,6322720," So let's take a look at the upscale version of this thing."
6322720,6327120," Okay."
6327120,6328480," This is the 8."
6328480,6329200," This is the 8."
6329200,6332480," And let's interpolate this thing to..."
6332480,6335280," This is a good interpolation."
6335280,6335440," Right."
6335440,6336880," This is a very good interpolation."
6336880,6339040," Let's take a look at how it looks like."
6339040,6340560," Okay."
6340560,6341760," So looks very good."
6341760,6344160," I think the video is going to be awesome."
6344160,6344400," Right."
6344400,6346720," Like a possum."
6347440,6350480," So let's get ready."
6350480,6355440," We are rendering the video."
6355440,6358560," That is actually going rather slow."
6358560,6361520," Okay."
6361520,6364720," So it rendered a single second."
6364720,6368000," So we said we're going to have five seconds."
6368000,6368240," Right."
6369920,6370560," So okay."
6370560,6376160," Maybe I should reduce the size."
6376160,6377840," Well, but I mean, I want you to see it in..."
6377840,6382320," In like a very good quality, if you know what I mean."
6382320,6385840," Um..."
6385840,6388320," All right."
6388320,6390000," How are you guys doing?"
6390000,6391840," Mmm..."
6391840,6392560," How are you guys doing?"
6394880,6395920," Why is it so slow?"
6395920,6397760," I don't know."
6397760,6399440," I'm probably because I also streaming."
6399440,6400480," Right."
6400480,6402320," So streaming also consumes resources."
6402320,6402480," Okay."
6402480,6404080," So it finished rendering the video."
6404080,6407680," And we are about to witness how..."
6407680,6412560," Like this thing is going to transition from one thing to another thing."
6412560,6414640," In a higher resolution."
6414640,6416880," Because here we're not doing like higher resolution."
6416880,6418640," Because it like takes too much resources."
6419600,6420880," So, um..."
6420880,6422000," So let's take a look."
6422000,6423200," I'm a little bit nervous actually."
6423200,6424240," So..."
6424240,6426080," I guess ready?"
6426080,6426560," Let's go."
6426560,6438720," This is so cool."
6438720,6439840," It's like a smoke."
6439840,6441040," Right?"
6441040,6445440," So you won't be able to see that in here in low resolution."
6445440,6446800," So this is basically this."
6447360,6449120," But in much higher resolution."
6449120,6450880," Much higher resolution."
6450880,6458160," So this is basically a neural network learned how to behave like this image."
6458160,6462960," And then basically we train it to behave like both of the image."
6462960,6464160," Right?"
6464160,6466480," With the third parameter which is interpolator."
6466480,6468080," Right?"
6468080,6472080," And then when you put something in between 0 and 1."
6472080,6475360," It starts to behave like 8 and 6 simultaneously."
6475360,6479600," So you can interpolate this thing between two images in here like that."
6479600,6483920," I think it should maybe wait a little bit."
6483920,6485600," Right?"
6485600,6487360," So like a couple of seconds."
6487360,6490080," But yeah."
6490080,6491280," That's actually pretty cool."
6491280,6492480," Perfect loop."
6492480,6492640," Yeah."
6492640,6495040," It would be kind of nice to make a perfect loop out of that."
6498720,6503280," Movie needs extra padding at start and end so 8 and 6 for a while before."
6503280,6503520," Yeah."
6503520,6504320," That's true."
6504320,6506720," That would have been 100% true."
6506720,6511200," And the question is how can we organize all of that?"
6511200,6513760," Right."
6513760,6514560," Essentially."
6517920,6520080," So let me let me see."
6520080,6524000," Render upscale video."
6524000,6530400," Looks like OG YouTube video intro."
6530400,6530880," Yeah."
6530880,6535760," So what's funny is that we generated like this whole video."
6535760,6536720," Let's just think about it."
6536720,6538240," We generated this whole video."
6539280,6540800," By using two images."
6540800,6544480," By using just two images from this database."
6544480,6546720," This is the first image."
6546720,6547440," You can't even see."
6547440,6548560," This is how small it is."
6548560,6550320," It's 28 by 28 pixels."
6550320,6552000," So this is the first image."
6552880,6554720," And the second image is 8."
6554720,6556560," Right."
6556560,6559520," So and this information was enough to generate that video."
6559520,6559680," Right."
6559680,6563520," So we just train the neural network to behave like these two things."
6563520,6566000," And then once we build this model."
6566000,6568960," We are able to like change parameters of that model."
6568960,6570400," And achieve these kind of effects."
6570400,6575840," What happens if you extrapolate from those images?"
6575840,6577200," That's a very interesting question."
6577200,6579040," One of the things we can do."
6579040,6581120," Is maybe."
6582880,6586480," So that requires like."
6586480,6589920," Too many modifications."
6589920,6590320," Right."
6590320,6590560," So."
6590560,6592560," Yeah."
6592560,6593840," It will be interesting to see."
6593840,6596080," What's beyond zero."
6596080,6597520," And beyond one."
6597520,6598240," If you know what I mean."
6598240,6605520," So."
6605520,6606480," Yeah."
6606480,6608400," Let me."
6608400,6608800," Let me see."
6608800,6610240," I want to kind of make this thing loop."
6610240,6611040," Right."
6612400,6614000," I want to kind of make it loop."
6614000,6619040," So where is the render upscaled video?"
6619040,6620000," There we go."
6620000,6620480," There it is."
6620480,6623520," So we have some sort of interpolation."
6623520,6629680," So it's a value from zero to one."
6629680,6629920," Right."
6629920,6630720," So for now."
6630720,6632480," We're just moving it directly."
6632480,6633840," One of the things we can do."
6633840,6634640," Probably."
6634640,6638080," Is just do easing in."
6638080,6639200," Like easing out."
6639200,6640320," That would be interesting."
6641680,6643040," So let me also."
6643040,6644640," Make a resolution."
6644640,6645520," A little bit smaller."
6645520,6647120," Maybe 256."
6647120,6648480," Probably not going to look that good."
6648480,6648720," But."
6648720,6650560," Yeah."
6652320,6652560," So."
6652560,6654080," So opt."
6654080,6655040," Ray."
6655040,6655360," Deep."
6655360,6656400," Environment."
6656400,6657200," Build."
6657200,6658320," The passage."
6658320,6658800," There we go."
6658800,6664000," All right."
6664000,6664480," So."
6672480,6674080," I don't really like this thing."
6674080,6675040," I don't really like this thing."
6675040,6676880," Let me restart."
6676880,6678800," So the cool thing is that I can always restart."
6678800,6684000," And this is where having like an ability to save the trained neural network."
6685120,6685760," Look at."
6685760,6686080," Yeah."
6686080,6689440," Look at how it actually figured out this loop as a separate thing."
6689440,6691680," It's actually fascinating."
6691680,6694640," This is a cool transition."
6694640,6695280," What the fuck."
6695280,6698240," This is a very cool transition."
6698240,6698800," Look at that."
6698800,6706880," This is the coolest tradition it came up with so far."
6706880,6707760," What the fuck."
6707760,6708000," Okay."
6708000,6709120," Let's render this thing."
6713840,6717840," It goes a little bit faster I suppose because I reduced the resolution."
6717840,6721120," Unfortunately."
6721120,6723360," I should have actually done that in a separate thread."
6723360,6725280," So I can keep playing with this thing."
6725280,6726400," This is."
6726400,6728320," Look at that fat 8."
6728320,6730080," That's so cool."
6730080,6731600," Anyway."
6731600,6731840," So."
6731840,6735600," It should now act differently because I'm doing easing out."
6735600,6737440," Because it's like a square thingy."
6737440,6738720," Right."
6738720,6739280," So let's see."
6743840,6749760," I know that there should be some padding."
6749760,6750160," Like."
6750160,6750480," Yeah."
6750480,6752160," So chat is going to be screaming at me."
6752160,6752640," Zozin."
6752640,6753760," There needs to be padding."
6753760,6754480," You don't understand."
6754480,6755200," I mean."
6755200,6756480," Somebody has to implement it."
6756480,6757280," Calm down."
6757280,6757600," Okay."
6757600,6759120," All right."
6759120,6759760," I understand."
6759760,6762160," But it's something that needs to be done."
6762160,6763120," Right."
6763120,6766240," And people who are screaming are not doing that."
6766240,6767520," It's me who's doing that."
6767520,6767840," Okay."
6767840,6772640," So let me."
6772640,6773280," Let me see."
6773280,6775920," I need to think how we can achieve all of that."
6775920,6780000," So essentially."
6782400,6785600," We want to be able to say."
6785600,6786560," Right."
6786560,6791200," Maybe we will even want to have some sort of like splines."
6791200,6792000," If you know what I mean."
6792000,6793040," Right."
6793040,6795040," Some sort of like splines."
6795040,6798400," Where we can say the following thing."
6798400,6801360," So where is my paint?"
6801360,6802160," Where is my paint?"
6802160,6807360," So here we have time."
6807360,6807680," Right."
6807680,6808560," So this is time."
6809920,6812240," And here the value of interpolator."
6812240,6816240," We want to be able to literally like define points like this."
6816240,6816560," Okay."
6816560,6818320," From here to here."
6818320,6819520," Right."
6819520,6820800," So the value is going to be like that."
6820800,6825280," Then we want like from here to here."
6825280,6827600," We want to interpolate like so."
6827600,6828480," Right."
6828480,6830720," Interpolate like so."
6830720,6835120," Then from like maybe like wait a little bit."
6835120,6836960," Right."
6837520,6840160," Then we want to interpolate like so."
6840160,6844720," Uh-huh."
6844720,6846800," And that's basically it."
6846800,6852160," Because this particular maybe even duration."
6852160,6853600," Let's call it D."
6853600,6856720," Is going to be the same as this duration."
6856720,6857120," Right."
6857120,6860400," And maybe it's going to be the same as any of this duration."
6860400,6860560," Right."
6860560,6864880," So we can basically divide all of this stuff by equal intervals."
6864880,6865440," Right."
6865440,6867200," So we want to do something like this."
6867200,6869760," Right."
6869760,6879280," So and essentially we have to divide the whole thing by four."
6879280,6879600," Right."
6879600,6881360," So we divide the whole thing by four."
6882240,6883760," And then in here."
6883760,6884000," Right."
6884000,6884640," Then in here."
6884640,6887440," We can basically."
6887440,6892160," Define a structure with a pair of."
6892160,6896080," With a pair of numbers."
6896080,6896320," Right."
6896320,6897680," The structure with a pair of numbers."
6897680,6898400," Which tells you."
6898400,6900400," Basically."
6900400,6902880," From which to which you have to go."
6902880,6904320," Right."
6905840,6907520," So that sounds like a plan."
6907520,6909360," So and that way you'll be able to control."
6909360,6911520," Like how exactly you want to do all of these things."
6911520,6912800," Right."
6912800,6913840," Is it called splines?"
6913840,6914800," Right."
6914800,6917680," I think it's called splice."
6917680,6923040," Sort of."
6930800,6932320," How are we going to organize all of that?"
6932320,6933600," So we need a structure."
6933600,6935520," I wonder if I can define structures like this."
6935520,6937360," Let's call it segment."
6937360,6937840," All right."
6937840,6940080," And essentially you have a start."
6940080,6941920," And you have an end of the segment."
6941920,6942080," Right."
6942080,6943520," So that's basically what we want to have."
6943520,6946800," And so we're going to basically assume."
6946800,6947040," Right."
6947040,6949520," So the whole system is going to assume that you have."
6949520,6951600," The segments are equal interval."
6951600,6951840," Right."
6951840,6953440," So they have equal intervals."
6953440,6956640," Segment and segments."
6956640,6958400," Right."
6958400,6960800," So and basically that's what we have."
6960800,6966800," So the first segment starts at zero and stays at zero."
6966800,6967520," Right."
6967520,6972160," So then the second segment starts at zero and goes towards one."
6972160,6977280," Then this one stays at one for the entirety of the whole segment."
6977280,6980880," And then this one goes from one to zero."
6982560,6982720," Yeah."
6982720,6984640," This looks like a binary counting."
6984640,6985840," But yeah."
6985840,6986240," Anyway."
6986240,6990640," So now we need a segment count."
6990640,6990880," Right."
6990880,6992160," So segments count."
6992160,6993680," How many of them do we have in here?"
6993680,6996320," So it's actually I think I already have array length."
6996320,6998880," So I should be able to just do something like segments."
6998880,6999440," And there we go."
6999440,7004400," So based on these segments, based on the segments,"
7004400,7010000," we can essentially compute the segment duration."
7010000,7014560," So let's assume that our entire duration is one second."
7014560,7014800," Right."
7014800,7016400," It's basically from zero to one."
7016400,7024400," So that means we can say segment length is going to be one divided by segment count."
7024400,7028000," Segment count."
7029120,7030640," So why are we doing all that?"
7030640,7035120," The reason we are doing all that because it allows us to do something like this."
7035120,7042560," We take the current A, which is interpolated from zero to one, which tells you like this is the"
7042560,7044000," percentage of the video."
7044000,7044240," Right."
7044240,7047120," So from zero to one, the closer you are to zero, the closer you are to the beginning."
7047120,7049360," And the closer to one, the closer you are to the end."
7049360,7050320," Right."
7050320,7053600," So we can divide by the segment length."
7053600,7053840," Right."
7053840,7062320," And the integer part of this division tells you what segment you are in."
7063280,7063920," Right."
7063920,7069680," So, and essentially after doing like a little bit of a floor and converted that to the integer,"
7069680,7076400," you will be able to just use that, to just use that in the segments."
7076400,7076960," Right."
7076960,7080240," Segments."
7080240,7082960," And that's the segment you are currently in."
7082960,7083200," Right."
7083200,7084640," That's the segment you are currently in."
7085920,7086560," Okay."
7086560,7095600," So we can maybe save this entire thing to something like segment index."
7095600,7095840," Right."
7095840,7097360," So this is the current segment."
7097360,7102880," So, and how far you are in within the segment?"
7102880,7109760," I suppose the fractional part tells you where you are within the segment."
7109760,7114960," Is there any function in C that tells you the fractional part of a floating point number?"
7114960,7118320," Because I know in assembly there was something like that."
7118320,7119600," Right."
7119600,7121280," But there should be something in C."
7121280,7121440," Right."
7121440,7122480," C."
7122480,7126960," Get fractional part of float."
7126960,7129200," There's one."
7129200,7130640," Okay."
7130640,7133360," Fractional part."
7133360,7134720," Fract."
7134720,7136000," There should be something like fract."
7136000,7139120," Maybe modf also is going to work."
7139120,7139680," Modf."
7139680,7140640," People suggest modf."
7144640,7145040," Okay."
7145040,7146720," Third alternative."
7146720,7149120," Subtract florf."
7149120,7150560," Okay."
7150560,7157280," So I guess we can just do modf."
7157280,7160240," I guess we can do modf."
7160240,7165280," So how can we call that thing?"
7165280,7165600," Right."
7165600,7167280," So if we just do modf."
7167280,7169760," F modf."
7169760,7170560," Specifically."
7170560,7172320," Over A."
7172320,7173360," And segment length."
7173360,7178640," So this is a basically segment progress."
7178640,7178880," Right."
7178880,7180400," So segment progress."
7180400,7181440," Right."
7181440,7182400," And essentially."
7187600,7188320," What we want to do."
7188320,7193520," We want to interpolate from that value."
7193520,7193840," Right."
7193840,7194640," So."
7194640,7196400," Yeah."
7196400,7198080," This is the segment index."
7198080,7199440," Then we can take the segment."
7199440,7199920," Right."
7199920,7200960," So segment."
7202640,7203040," Index."
7203040,7203920," There's that."
7203920,7205360," So then."
7205360,7207440," We can do segment end."
7207440,7208240," Minus."
7208240,7209200," The segment start."
7209200,7210400," Right."
7210400,7211680," And then."
7211680,7214080," We're multiplying that by the segment progress."
7214080,7214320," Right."
7214320,7216880," And that basically interpolates that value from."
7216880,7217760," Start to end."
7217760,7218960," Only if we add."
7218960,7220400," Start in here."
7220400,7222880," And that's the final."
7222880,7223360," Value."
7223360,7223760," That."
7223760,7224880," That we have to put."
7224880,7226400," In here."
7226400,7226640," Right."
7226640,7227760," That's the final value."
7228720,7230960," So let's see how it is going to work."
7230960,7233440," So let's call it B."
7233440,7233760," Maybe."
7233760,7236160," So this is going to be B."
7236160,7238480," And we can also do like a square thing here."
7238480,7238720," Right."
7238720,7239120," Why not?"
7239120,7240000," So."
7240000,7241440," Yeah."
7241440,7242960," That's the way to do that."
7242960,7243360," I think."
7243360,7245440," We'll see."
7245440,7245760," We'll see."
7245760,7246080," We'll see."
7246080,7248000," One of the things we can do."
7248000,7250080," While we are rendering this entire stuff."
7250080,7253040," We can render the value of B."
7253040,7253360," Right."
7253360,7253600," So."
7253600,7256720," Because I want to be able to see how it just goes up and down."
7257920,7260320," Y the square for easing in and easing out."
7260320,7261120," So essentially."
7261120,7265200," Right."
7265200,7269280," So you have a value from 0 to 1."
7269280,7271840," Right."
7271840,7274560," So you have a value from 0 to 1."
7274560,7276880," And it maps to a value 1."
7276880,7279360," So initially if you just like use B."
7279360,7280960," You're going to have something like this."
7280960,7281680," Right."
7281680,7283120," You're going to have something like this."
7283120,7285600," If you multiply it by itself."
7285600,7286000," Right."
7286000,7287280," If you take a square."
7287280,7289120," It's not going to be greater than 0."
7289120,7291600," It's still going to be from 0 to 1."
7291600,7292480," But then."
7292480,7294160," It is going to have a shape."
7294160,7295680," Like this."
7295680,7296000," Right."
7296000,7297280," It's going to start slow."
7297280,7299040," And then speed up at the end."
7299040,7300240," And it will just look better."
7300240,7301440," Hopefully."
7301440,7304080," You can also use square root."
7304080,7304320," Right."
7304320,7305440," You can actually use square root."
7305440,7306720," In that case it's going to look like this."
7306720,7311040," And I think the square root in here specifically."
7311040,7311680," Could be better."
7311680,7312960," Right."
7312960,7314480," Because in here."
7314480,7314960," Yeah."
7314960,7316400," This is a square root actually."
7316400,7318320," So we probably want to use square root."
7318320,7319440," And in here."
7319440,7321760," We go from 1 to 0."
7321760,7322560," So that means."
7322560,7324320," Yeah."
7324320,7326000," We probably want to use square roots in here."
7326000,7327440," So thank you for asking that question."
7327440,7329280," That actually forced me to draw that."
7329280,7330960," And realize that the square."
7330960,7332880," Square is not exactly what I want."
7332880,7334080," I think I want the square root."
7334080,7335520," Right."
7335520,7336320," So in here."
7336320,7338800," It's going to."
7338800,7340800," Yeah."
7340800,7341840," It's going to be inverted."
7341840,7342640," So yeah."
7342640,7343840," So this is going to be squared."
7343840,7352320," So and here's the interesting thing."
7352320,7353280," That implies."
7353280,7356000," That you can plug in different functions in here."
7356000,7357760," And it is a thing."
7357760,7358400," In fact."
7358400,7359200," In animation."
7359200,7359520," Right."
7359520,7360960," So is in."
7360960,7363760," Is in."
7363760,7365920," Is out functions."
7365920,7366160," Right."
7366160,7368080," So it is in fact a thing."
7369600,7370880," All right."
7370880,7372080," So is in functions."
7372080,7372800," Yeah."
7372800,7374160," So there's also cheat sheet."
7374160,7374800," So yeah."
7374800,7376960," There are different websites that demonstrate you."
7376960,7378560," How they feel."
7378560,7379520," And how they behave."
7379520,7381360," Right."
7381360,7383360," So."
7383360,7384320," I remember this website."
7384320,7385280," So we can basically."
7385280,7387360," Yeah."
7387360,7388800," You can like navigate here."
7388800,7390080," And play with this entire stuff."
7390080,7391520," So I'm going to actually put this in here."
7391520,7394880," It is a very common thing in animation."
7394880,7395680," Seriously."
7395680,7396800," It is a very common thing."
7396800,7399520," And I'm going to also put that in the description."
7399600,7400080," Right."
7400080,7403040," So this is going to be easing.net."
7403040,7406560," Oh yeah."
7406560,7409280," I suppose we can do one minus the square."
7409280,7410960," Yeah."
7410960,7411680," Because they are."
7411680,7411920," Yeah."
7411920,7413520," So we can save a little bit on."
7413520,7414960," So essentially the chat suggests."
7414960,7416640," So."
7416640,7417040," I mean."
7417040,7419680," We need to say the nickname of a person who suggested."
7419680,7420960," But they have this nickname."
7420960,7422320," So."
7422320,7422560," Yeah."
7422560,7424880," Anyway."
7424880,7425280," Thank you."
7425280,7425920," Thank you so much."
7425920,7426640," So essentially."
7426640,7429280," Since we have values from zero to one."
7429280,7430560," We can just do something like this."
7430560,7430720," Right."
7430720,7431920," So we're going to achieve the same thing."
7431920,7433600," Right."
7433600,7434000," So."
7434000,7435040," But we'll see."
7435040,7438000," So I just want to first see if it's going to work or not."
7438000,7440080," Right."
7440080,7441440," Couldn't apply it with sigmoid."
7441440,7444240," Not a bad idea either actually."
7444240,7444720," Right."
7447600,7449360," Isn't our really important thing."
7449360,7451760," If you want to make animation feel more natural."
7451760,7452000," Yeah."
7452000,7455040," It is true."
7455040,7456160," It is 100% true."
7456160,7457680," Flortf."
7457680,7458560," It's not a flortf."
7458560,7461040," Segment count."
7461040,7463280," Segment count."
7463280,7463440," Okay."
7463440,7465280," So we need to go through compilation errors."
7465280,7467840," And this is not flortf either."
7467840,7470320," It's flortf."
7476000,7476480," All right."
7476480,7477840," So let me."
7477840,7478560," Let me see."
7478560,7478880," So."
7478880,7479760," All right."
7479760,7481840," So is it going to do the thingy?"
7481840,7483920," All right."
7483920,7486720," So let's actually slow down the thing."
7486720,7495440," It's actually stuck a little bit in here."
7495440,7497760," Because of this little tail."
7497760,7499360," Can't really go any further."
7499360,7500160," Let's actually restart."
7502400,7504880," Sometimes it finds like a really weird configuration."
7504880,7513360," Could you just tell the loops."
7513360,7515280," Generate extra less frame."
7515280,7516560," By feeding more or less."
7516560,7518400," Same similar values through activation."
7518400,7519920," I guess."
7519920,7522800," But I want to achieve a very specific result."
7529280,7531600," And I want to have a like a control over that result."
7531600,7533040," As well."
7533040,7533280," Okay."
7533280,7535280," I think this one could actually work out."
7535280,7540560," I don't really like this."
7540560,7542240," This sort of little tail."
7542240,7545120," So let's take a look at that."
7545120,7548400," Yeah."
7548400,7549760," It's it's kind of bizarre."
7549760,7550000," Like."
7550000,7551360," Yikes."
7551360,7554800," But we can like just keep training it for a little bit more."
7554800,7558160," Maybe it will get rid of that connection in here at some point."
7558160,7563360," It's going down."
7563360,7564960," So it's slowly getting rid of that."
7564960,7568800," Still there."
7568800,7569360," I don't like it."
7569360,7571600," One more time."
7571600,7577200," It's just like with anything related to machine learning."
7577200,7578000," Just try again."
7578000,7579840," Just roll the dice one more time."
7579840,7581680," What the fuck is this?"
7583360,7586320," We're so unlucky today with training."
7586320,7600080," It still creates this connection."
7600080,7602000," I mean this time it's a little better."
7602000,7604480," Yeah."
7604480,7605280," It's already better."
7605280,7606560," I think we can stop here."
7606560,7608000," This is a good result."
7608000,7608720," I really like it."
7611520,7612080," Yeah."
7612080,7612720," This is a good one."
7612720,7614480," Okay."
7614480,7615040," So let's."
7615040,7615680," Let's run this."
7615680,7617280," Okay."
7617280,7618000," As you can see."
7618000,7618880," This is the frames."
7618880,7619120," Right."
7619120,7619520," So this."
7619520,7621120," And it goes up."
7621120,7621360," Up."
7621360,7624560," It stays at one."
7624560,7626000," For some time."
7626000,7628560," And then it goes down."
7628560,7632240," Cool."
7632240,7633360," So."
7633360,7633520," But."
7633520,7635200," It was weird."
7638640,7639920," That is sus."
7639920,7641200," What the fuck."
7641200,7642400," It didn't go fully down."
7642400,7645200," All right."
7645200,7647440," Okay."
7647440,7647680," So."
7647680,7649920," Let's see how it looks like."
7649920,7652240," But that was truly sus."
7652240,7654400," This is the susest thing."
7654400,7656320," I've ever seen."
7662240,7662720," Oh yeah."
7662720,7664400," Invert square root horizontally."
7664400,7666640," Okay."
7666640,7667280," So."
7667280,7668240," Yeah."
7668240,7668640," Because."
7668640,7669600," I see what's going on."
7669600,7669840," Yes."
7669840,7671600," But."
7671600,7673360," That actually implies."
7673360,7674880," That I have to literally put."
7674880,7677600," Different."
7677600,7679280," Functions in here."
7679280,7681200," And this is something that I don't want."
7681200,7681520," Okay."
7681520,7683440," Let's actually not fuck with functions."
7683440,7684400," All right."
7684400,7685120," Let's just like."
7685120,7686160," Use them like this."
7687200,7688560," And hope."
7688560,7689760," Right."
7689760,7693520," That is going to work out."
7693520,7695600," I may add."
7695600,7697360," Different sort of easing in."
7697360,7698400," And out functions."
7698400,7699040," A little bit later."
7699040,7704240," Why is it important to control."
7704240,7705040," The learning rate."
7705040,7706480," You don't really have to."
7706480,7706720," But."
7706720,7708640," If you don't."
7708640,7710240," It just like becomes too crazy."
7710240,7711200," And I'm a little bit afraid."
7711200,7712960," That it's going to go off track."
7712960,7713920," Too much."
7713920,7714160," Right."
7714160,7716080," Because here it's like calm."
7716080,7717760," But here it just goes to crazy."
7717760,7718880," I just wanted to reduce."
7718880,7720000," Its craziness a little bit."
7720000,7721360," And it just like goes fine."
7721360,7724480," You know what I mean."
7724480,7727840," Seeing my work out nicely."
7727840,7728080," Yeah."
7728080,7728480," It's true."
7728480,7730720," So."
7730720,7731360," Usually."
7731360,7732400," Like learning rate."
7732400,7733120," Is controlled."
7733120,7734160," Like automatically."
7734160,7736080," But they just decided to."
7736080,7736960," Make it manual."
7736960,7737840," Because it's kind of."
7737840,7738800," Like nice to."
7738800,7739680," Like adjust."
7739680,7740640," As you see."
7740640,7741040," Right."
7741040,7742080," Just to play with this thing."
7742080,7742720," To get."
7742720,7743680," To get the gist of them."
7743680,7744960," You know what I mean."
7745920,7746400," Hmm."
7746400,7746720," Okay."
7746720,7747920," So let's render this thing."
7747920,7749200," I think it's going to work fine."
7749200,7753760," I shouldn't learning rate."
7753760,7755360," To be very low."
7755360,7755600," Yeah."
7755600,7756000," It should be."
7756000,7757120," But we're using sigmoids."
7757120,7757760," So."
7757760,7758480," With sigmoids."
7758480,7759200," It's kind of fine."
7759200,7762640," It doesn't go down fully."
7762640,7763760," What the hell is going on?"
7763760,7766720," Am I crazy?"
7766720,7768480," Why does it go down fully?"
7768480,7769200," Did I make a."
7769200,7770400," Oopsie doopsie somewhere?"
7772160,7773920," Don't tell me I did an oopsie doopsie."
7773920,7776800," I genuinely don't."
7776800,7779600," Could it be because it's overflows?"
7779600,7780720," Yeah."
7780720,7781840," What the fuck is going on?"
7781840,7785440," Let it go up."
7790320,7790880," All right."
7790880,7794640," So here is stuff from zero to one."
7794640,7796160," So here we have these things."
7796160,7798800," This is array length."
7798800,7801840," Yeah."
7801840,7805280," So weird."
7805280,7806800," Okay."
7806800,7809120," Let me think."
7810000,7810480," So."
7810480,7815520," This should be fine."
7815520,7818560," Then we do floor."
7818560,7823760," So that gives us the segment."
7823760,7826160," And the segment should be fine."
7826160,7827600," I think."
7827600,7831920," One of the things we can do."
7834480,7836240," Is that if segment."
7836240,7838880," Index."
7838880,7840720," Is greater than the segment length."
7840720,7842720," Right."
7842720,7843600," For whatever reason."
7843600,7847280," We may want to bring it."
7847280,7850000," Back to segment length."
7850000,7852160," Minus one."
7852160,7852400," Right."
7852400,7853760," And then."
7853760,7855040," So it doesn't overflow."
7855040,7855920," For whatever reason."
7855920,7857760," So in here we do."
7857760,7858640," F mode."
7858640,7859680," So which tells us."
7859680,7861040," The segment progress."
7863200,7863600," Right."
7863600,7865360," And within the segment progress."
7865360,7865680," Right."
7865680,7866480," So we just do."
7866480,7868400," This thing."
7868400,7869280," Minus this thing."
7869280,7872000," And multiply it by that."
7872000,7879920," So then we put B in here."
7891920,7892960," So I think."
7892960,7894480," I want to also print."
7894480,7896720," The segment index."
7896720,7896960," Right."
7896960,7897920," The segment index."
7897920,7899680," Right."
7899680,7900560," So index."
7900560,7904960," Progress."
7904960,7907840," And B."
7907840,7911680," The progress has to be F."
7914640,7927680," So I don't think we need to train anything."
7927680,7928240," Right."
7928240,7932400," So because we are troubleshooting the rendering process."
7932400,7935200," So I can just try to render whatever we have in here."
7935200,7937680," So index goes up."
7940080,7942080," And it stays at the same index."
7942080,7944080," Yep."
7944080,7948480," I see the problem."
7948480,7951200," It stays at the same index."
7951200,7951520," Okay."
7951520,7955360," So segment index stays the same."
7955360,7958560," Even though segment length."
7958560,7961200," Okay."
7961200,7964400," So let's take a look at the segment length."
7964400,7970880," Because I would expect it to."
7970880,7973200," To work."
7973200,7973440," And."
7973440,7975280," Yeah."
7975280,7976560," Florif has to be like a."
7976560,7978720," Whole part."
7978720,7980320," I mean integer part."
7980320,7982800," I think it's called integer part in here."
7982800,7985360," So let's say segment length."
7985360,7989120," And actually exit one in here."
7989120,7989280," Right."
7989280,7990240," So because I wanted to."
7990240,7991520," Just stop and then do anything."
7991520,7992960," Because that's the only value."
7992960,7994240," That I want to observe in here."
7994240,7999520," So undeclared segment length."
7999520,8007680," Makes sense."
8007680,8009440," Okay."
8011760,8030720," Because I'm pretty sure."
8030720,8031120," Right."
8031120,8031840," So if you have."
8031840,8035920," 0.15 divided by 25."
8035920,8037840," You have something like this."
8037840,8039440," Right."
8039440,8040720," Then you have 25."
8040720,8041680," If it's one."
8041680,8042480," If it's bigger."
8042480,8044000," Yeah."
8044000,8044320," It's."
8044320,8045280," It makes sense."
8045280,8046480," The bigger it is."
8046480,8047520," Right."
8047520,8048400," The more."
8048400,8049360," It should be fine."
8049360,8051040," But it never."
8051040,8052720," It never here."
8052720,8054080," In this specific case."
8054080,8055280," Became greater than zero."
8055280,8059280," This is extremely weird."
8059280,8060320," Right."
8060320,8063040," So it should work."
8064080,8065200," It may not work."
8065200,8068240," Only if the A is not what I think it is."
8068240,8069680," Right."
8069680,8073200," So this is the only reason why this won't work."
8073200,8073520," Right."
8073520,8086560," Segment length index is greater than segment length."
8087200,8087440," No."
8087440,8088960," What the hell are you talking about."
8088960,8089920," I don't know what you're talking about."
8089920,8090800," All right."
8090800,8091200," So."
8091200,8095120," All right."
8095120,8098560," Yeah."
8098560,8099920," So at this point."
8099920,8101680," At this point."
8101680,8105200," The index has to be."
8105200,8107280," Greater than."
8107280,8108160," It must be."
8108160,8109760," There is no other way."
8109760,8111200," But it just stays the same."
8111680,8113200," Is that because of the floor?"
8113200,8114880," Right."
8114880,8116560," So A is a float."
8116560,8118160," Segment length."
8118160,8119840," Uh-huh."
8119840,8126880," It could be weird floor thing."
8126880,8129920," But I refuse to believe that it's a weird floor thing."
8129920,8138160," No."
8141680,8142480," No."
8142480,8147600," Is that?"
8147600,8153920," Don't tell me that's the reason."
8153920,8169040," I'm going to be extremely disappointed."
8171680,8172240," No."
8172240,8177680," Oh."
8177680,8180000," I think I see what the hell is going on."
8180000,8193760," That's what I want."
8193760,8195680," Yeah."
8195680,8198000," God damn it."
8198000,8198400," Okay."
8198400,8201680," Segment count."
8201680,8204480," Okay."
8204480,8205200," We found it."
8205200,8206880," I think we found it finally."
8206880,8207520," Holy shit."
8207520,8208720," Uh."
8208720,8210000," All right."
8210000,8212880," Yeah."
8212880,8213200," Finally."
8213200,8213440," Okay."
8213440,8213920," It works."
8213920,8214960," It works."
8214960,8217760," All right."
8219520,8219920," Okay."
8219920,8220240," Go."
8220240,8222960," All righty."
8222960,8226160," So let's go ahead and try to train this thing."
8226160,8228080," So I'm going to redo it one more time."
8228080,8230880," So first let's come up with an interesting animation."
8230880,8236320," Let's come up with an interesting animation."
8245600,8246400," Okay."
8246400,8248160," Let's do a little bit of snapshots."
8248160,8250560," This is not what I meant."
8250560,8252720," Okay."
8252720,8256800," So what about six?"
8256800,8260880," It's having this"
8260880,8264400," Emacs."
8264400,8264720," Come on."
8265360,8265600," Yeah."
8265600,8267840," It's still having this thing in here again."
8267840,8270800," But whatever."
8270800,8271600," Let's actually try it."
8271600,8278160," All right."
8278160,8279280," It's going places."
8279280,8282640," Then it should be going down."
8289040,8301600," Did I?"
8301600,8307280," Why?"
8307280,8314800," Why it didn't do?"
8316800,8319040," Why didn't it fully went there?"
8319040,8320720," Okay."
8320720,8322000," Well, let's watch the video."
8322000,8322880," Let's watch the video."
8322880,8325840," Okay."
8325840,8336240," From zero to zero."
8336240,8336560," Okay."
8336560,8338000," From zero to one."
8338000,8339600," Okay."
8339600,8340400," Stay at one."
8340400,8342560," One to zero."
8345120,8346320," I need to make a small break."
8346320,8350000," It's just like I cannot visualize anything in here."
8350000,8351040," Because I'm already tired."
8351040,8355120," I already have to do it for three hours."
8355120,8356640," Okay."
8356640,8357680," So let's do a small break."
8357680,8358800," All right."
8358800,8360240," So I feel like"
8360240,8365120," Stack Overflow gebaited me."
8365120,8368080," Or maybe I didn't use it correctly."
8368080,8369200," Something like that."
8369200,8370960," But thing is."
8370960,8372800," What we need to do."
8372800,8374960," We need to."
8374960,8378560," Essentially take."
8378560,8382320," The floor of this entire stuff."
8382320,8386880," Take this thing one more time."
8386880,8387840," And subtract."
8387840,8390000," This thing."
8390000,8391520," Because I need a fractional part."
8391520,8393040," I think that might work."
8393040,8393280," Right."
8393280,8395280," Because I just need a fractional part."
8395280,8396160," Of the entire stuff."
8396160,8398080," So let's give it a try."
8398080,8399040," I'm not 100% sure."
8399040,8399920," Because I'm already tired."
8399920,8402400," So obviously my brain doesn't work."
8402400,8403760," As well."
8403760,8405360," As I would like it to work."
8405360,8408640," But maybe we can actually."
8408640,8409200," Go ahead."
8409200,8411120," And try to render it already."
8411120,8412400," Just to see how it's going to go."
8412400,8414480," Because I'm going to be looking at the values."
8414480,8417200," Okay."
8417200,8418480," It's staying at one."
8420560,8422080," Hopefully it's going to."
8422080,8425360," I think it's working."
8425360,8426080," Yeah."
8426080,8426800," It's working."
8426800,8427120," Nice."
8427120,8428320," Cool."
8428320,8429280," Okay."
8429280,8430560," So let's actually train it."
8430560,8433040," Yep."
8433040,8439440," All right."
8439440,8442400," And let's render that."
8442400,8444160," That's cool."
8444160,8445360," It will be also kind of cool to."
8445360,8448560," Show the progress of rendering."
8448560,8450000," But that was kind of difficult."
8450000,8451040," Right."
8451040,8452400," Because that means you have to."
8452400,8453920," Yeah."
8453920,8455760," It could actually work."
8455760,8456640," To some extent."
8456640,8460400," Making it like sort of asynchronous."
8460400,8462080," Yeah."
8462080,8464480," So let me."
8464480,8465680," Let me give it a try."
8465680,8466560," So upscale."
8466560,8467200," Let's see."
8467200,8468000," If it's going to."
8468000,8472720," And then going back."
8474000,8474800," I wonder."
8474800,8474800," I wonder."
8474800,8475360," By the way."
8475360,8476240," If you can loop."
8476240,8480400," Playback."
8480400,8486320," I think that's the."
8486320,8490240," Can it just loop?"
8490240,8497040," Why is it freaking flickering?"
8497040,8497680," VLC."
8497680,8501920," Is it such an unsolved computer science problem to not flicker when you restart the video?"
8501920,8502240," Just like."
8502240,8506240," Freaking."
8506240,8507920," I swear to God."
8507920,8510880," So maybe we can try a different."
8510880,8513520," This is like ruining all of the vibe."
8518080,8518400," Yeah."
8518400,8518960," And okay."
8518960,8520560," So how do you loop in VLC?"
8520560,8523120," What was that?"
8523120,8525120," MPV."
8525120,8528560," Is it really that hard?"
8528560,8531120," Is it really that unsolved of a computer science problem?"
8531120,8532000," I don't really know."
8532000,8533760," Right."
8533760,8534000," Loop."
8534000,8535440," Set."
8535440,8536560," Okay."
8536560,8540800," Set clear AB loop points."
8540800,8542560," I have no idea what the fuck it is."
8542560,8544000," Toggle infinite looping."
8544000,8545040," Why do we have to toggle it?"
8545040,8546160," Is there any flag for that?"
8546160,8548800," All right."
8548800,8549520," So loop."
8549520,8551760," I don't want to toggle anything."
8551760,8553280," I want to just run the flag."
8553280,8557040," Okay."
8557040,8558480," They have to toggle."
8558480,8560560," MPV."
8560560,8562560," Right."
8562560,8563440," Looping currently."
8563440,8563680," Yes."
8563680,8568480," Finally."
8571760,8572400," Look at that."
8572400,8574720," EasyNet poggers."
8574720,8576320," EasyNet freaking poggers."
8576320,8580560," And this is what neural networks are capable of producing."
8580560,8583280," And look how it kind of reuses the same hole."
8583280,8584240," Right."
8584240,8586160," It's just like uses the same hole in here."
8586160,8587040," And it's just like, yeah."
8587040,8591280," This is so fucking cool."
8591280,8600080," That is absolutely fucking poggers."
8600800,8602480," Absolutely fucking poggers."
8602480,8606000," Right."
8606000,8606560," So."
8606560,8609280," And maybe we can try to do the square root."
8609280,8609600," Right."
8609600,8611520," So let's actually try the square root of this thing."
8611520,8615040," Might as well, actually."
8616960,8619920," just do b equal square root like that."
8619920,8624320," So it will be automatically applied for both rendering and logging."
8624320,8625600," Right."
8625600,8627360," So let's actually try and see."
8632080,8632800," Okay, again."
8632800,8638480," Okay, again."
8638480,8648800," Okay."
8648800,8650240," Let's render this thing."
8653360,8656400," So right now UI is blocked, as you can see."
8656400,8660880," Making it unblocked would have been really interesting."
8660880,8665680," So that means you need some sort of a state machine within the event loop."
8665680,8670960," That effectively tells you whether you are in a training mode or in a rendering mode."
8670960,8671520," Right."
8671520,8674240," And depending on that, you just render things differently."
8674240,8676480," Right."
8676480,8681920," And essentially you handle the event loop along with the child process of a third impact."
8681920,8682960," Right."
8683920,8684240," So."
8684240,8687680," Okay."
8687680,8705920," I really like how square root just speed up and slow down."
8705920,8706320," Look at it."
8706320,8710880," Right."
8710880,8713280," And when we go back, what do we actually want?"
8713920,8716000," So."
8716000,8717440," Yeah."
8717440,8722480," In case of the like a square root, we actually want to maybe like convert it."
8722480,8725760," You can notice that."
8725760,8726160," Yeah."
8726160,8728880," That's why easing in and easing out so important."
8728880,8729120," Right."
8729120,8730560," That's why it is so important."
8730560,8735440," But like inverting this kind of stuff for that specific segment"
8735440,8739280," actually means that we need to"
8739280,8742000," distinguish them somehow."
8742000,8743440," Right."
8743440,8747920," So we can maybe define a function."
8747920,8748480," Right."
8748480,8751600," So func, which by itself is enumeration."
8751600,8755120," So in here you can have func ID."
8755120,8755680," Right."
8755680,8757040," So which doesn't do anything."
8757040,8758080," Func."
8758080,8759280," Sqrt F."
8759280,8760800," So in case of Sqrt F or maybe Sqrt actually."
8760800,8764640," So in case of Sqrt, what we want, we basically"
8764640,8770720," want to just invert this, I suppose."
8770720,8770960," Right."
8770960,8775200," Though it's kind of difficult to tell."
8780560,8781520," Maybe apply it to the segment progress."
8781520,8782560," Maybe apply it to the segment progress."
8782560,8789440," It's basically the same as applying it to B because we are using segment progress to interpolate"
8789440,8791040," between start and end."
8791040,8792560," Right."
8792560,8796160," And that's base."
8796160,8797760," Well, I see what you mean."
8797760,8798160," Yeah."
8798160,8799040," I see what you mean."
8799040,8801920," So maybe, maybe that's the thing."
8801920,8803520," Yeah, that's, that's a good one."
8803520,8805200," Thank you, SSL was going through."
8805200,8807680," Right."
8807680,8812240," So I was about to actually over-engineer my solution, but you saved me, I think."
8812240,8817360," Okay, go."
8817360,8833200," I'm sorry for a bit boxing."
8833200,8836960," I know that it kind of like interacts with the currently playing song."
8836960,8838800," Not in a really good way."
8838800,8843600," And this is how inverse square root was discovered."
8843600,8847680," I suppose."
8847680,8854320," Elevator music went."
8854320,8857040," I don't know what to tell me."
8861200,8862720," Can we just like speed it up?"
8862720,8868240," It's really like, I really like this image because for this neural network, sometimes it is really"
8868240,8869760," hard to close that loop."
8869760,8870720," Right."
8870720,8876400," So sometimes it really struggles to find the configuration that closes that loop."
8876400,8878320," It just depends on like from what."
8879680,8879920," Yeah."
8879920,8879920," Yeah."
8879920,8879920," Yeah."
8879920,8881280," Now it is easy for it."
8881280,8885040," It just like really, really depends on how it starts."
8885040,8889840," Oh, this one is good."
8889840,8891600," Yo, look at that."
8892720,8895760," this is such a cool thing."
8895760,8897440," Let's actually make it a little bit more refined."
8906480,8907280," I guess it's fine."
8907280,8911280," Okay."
8911280,8912480," Let's go ahead and render this."
8915360,8916160," Hmm."
8945360,8946240," Easing."
8946240,8954000," Easing function actually makes it look better."
8954000,8962240," So that's why these easing functions are so important."
8962240,8963440," They make it look good."
8964240,8964480," Right."
8964480,8965600," So that's the whole point."
8965600,8970560," This is so fucking awesome."
8970560,8974640," Now, this is something I would post on Twitter."
8974640,8975520," Yes."
8975520,8978320," Finally, some Twitter content."
8981840,8982800," Yeah."
8982800,8986080," That is very robust."
8986080,8994400," Imagine like actually like doing something more complex with more complex images and stuff like that."
8994400,9002400," But with more complex images, they have a higher resolution, which means that we have a lot of training data."
9002400,9004000," Right."
9004000,9009680," Some of the things we'll have to implement if we want to work with bigger images is sampling."
9009680,9010000," Right."
9010000,9015280," Essentially, we don't want to turn each pixel of the image into a training sample."
9015280,9015520," Right."
9015520,9020080," We want to turn on these specific random samples."
9020080,9022400," And we want to randomly sample this entire thing."
9022400,9024960," And the question is, how can we sample an image?"
9024960,9027280," Well, we have to implement a blue noise."
9027280,9027520," Right."
9027520,9035280," So and basically the stream where we're going to do that will turn into like a blue noise algorithm exploration."
9035280,9039280," Though the simple blue noise algorithm is actually super easy to implement."
9039280,9039520," Right."
9039520,9042320," So, yeah."
9042320,9050800," As far as I know, they are using like very simple heuristics that allow you very quickly, like in linear time, generate like N samples."
9050800,9057840," Can it make 25 FPS cartoon into 60 FPS?"
9059360,9063040," Well, I mean, if you watched the stream, you would have known the answer."
9063040,9065920," All right."
9065920,9067120," So that's pretty poggers."
9067120,9068400," I guess that's it for today."
9068400,9071760," Thanks everyone who's watching me right now."
9071760,9072800," I really appreciate that."
9072800,9077200," So have I acknowledged the subscribers?"
9077200,9077840," I'm a robot."
9077840,9080080," Thank you so much for 39 months."
9080080,9080960," Thank you."
9080960,9081280," Thank you."
9081280,9081280," Thank you."
9081280,9081520," Thank you."
9081520,9082560," I really appreciate that."
9082560,9082880," All right."
9082880,9086480," So that's the today's stream."
9086480,9087920," That's the result of today's stream."
9087920,9088640," Look at that."
9088640,9089440," Isn't that poggers?"
9089440,9091280," That's absolutely freaking poggers."
9091280,9096400," I'm going to work on that a little bit more off screen and maybe come up with something cool."
9096400,9098320," and maybe post that on Twitter, right?"
9098320,9100080," So, yeah."
9100080,9101040," All right."
9101040,9101920," That's it for the day."
9101920,9103920," Thanks everyone who's watching me right now."
9103920,9104960," I really appreciate that."
9104960,9105760," Have a good one."
9105760,9108880," And I see you all on next recreational programming session."
9108880,9117440," I love you."
