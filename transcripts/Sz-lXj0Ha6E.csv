400,6800," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another azuzin session hello hello welcome"
6800,12720," welcome welcome uh let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start the stream how"
12720,21760," about that so uh the usual red circle live on twitch and what are we doing today on twitch.at"
21760,30720," television website today we're doing neural neural networks with array lib visualization right that's"
30720,39520," what we're doing today i'm gonna give the link to twitch.tv https twitch oh my god can't type today"
39520,45920," twitch.tv/todding and also i'm gonna ping everyone who's interested in being pink and there we go"
45920,52560," the stream has officially started the stream has officially started so what are we doing uh today"
52560,59840," essentially today we continue developing nn.h which is a simple stb style header only library for neural"
59840,64400," networks we've been developing it for quite some time uh i really enjoy developing it because i'm"
64400,69680," learning a lot of interesting things i'm going to give the link to this thing here in the chat and for"
69680,75680," people who's watching that on youtube it's going to be here in the description right so uh what we were"
75680,80000," doing on the previous stream on the previous stream we were trying to implement like a very simple"
80000,89520," visualization of uh how the neural network learns essentially uh we would uh visualize the uh the"
89520,95840," neurons and the connections and color them differently depending on their strength right so uh let's"
95840,102240," actually take a look at how it looks like right so what we implemented we implemented a simple adder"
102240,105440," uh as a neural network so i don't remember how big it is so it"
105440,110880," it it can actually add only four bit uh two four bit numbers that's what it can do"
110880,119280," uh right and essentially while it was learning to do that uh we were taking snapshots of the state"
119280,124080," of the neural network right so if we take a look at one single snapshot so i think we can start at zero"
124080,129280," zero zero zero and let me actually make a black uh background so this is how the neural network"
129280,136160," initially looked like right it has eight uh sort of inputs right so two hidden layers and uh actually two"
136160,143520," outputs uh right so this is how it looks like and essentially what we can do now we can try to display"
143520,150400," all of the uh all of the images and just go through these snapshots of the uh of the neural network and"
150400,157360," how it learns so here we have 50 snapshots and i think it doesn't really happen like do anything until"
157360,164960," like snapshot 13 uh or something like four yeah so on 15th snapshot it sort of jumps and learns really"
164960,171040," quickly and basically continues learning uh kind of from from them and sort of as you can see it keeps"
171040,177600," adjusting the things uh right so here i'm going backwards right so this is the sort of initial state"
177600,183680," and then i go forwards and this is how it's sort of adjusting its uh weights and biases until it learns"
183680,190320," how to add uh four bit integers so that's pretty cool visualization it's actually kind of cool to see"
190320,196480," how uh right it's just jumps to a particular configuration and then continues like adjusting"
196480,202640," weights and biases so that's actually pretty cool and uh this is not particularly a convenient way of"
203360,208240," looking at the visualization if you know what i mean right so what i initially wanted to do i"
208240,214400," wanted this thing to be actually like a gui style thing so essentially i would start the application"
214400,220320," it would open a window and show me the process in real time it will show me how this thing learns"
220320,229360," in real time right so and this is what i wanted to essentially dedicate today's stream for uh two actually"
229360,234480," i'm sorry i don't speak english uh right and uh to do that we'll need to use some sort of a graphical"
234480,239600," library and i was thinking what kind of library do i want to use initially i wanted to use sdl but sdl"
239600,246960," is kind of an ass when it comes to like shapes that are more complex than a rectangle so if you want"
246960,254240," to draw anything that is more complex than rectangle you just use sdl as a glorified open gl initializer"
254240,261120," right so and what i decided to do today i decided to give arraylib another try i already used raylib"
261120,266640," uh some time ago just like checked it out on the stream but didn't really do anything useful for"
266640,272960," myself in uh this library so i decided to give it another try and see how we can utilize it for"
272960,280080," visualization of the neural network learning process right if you know what i mean so i'm going to give"
280080,285200," the link to this library in here right so uh here you can find it and also for people who's watching"
285200,291760," on youtube it's going to be in the description as well so uh let's go i suppose let's go i think some"
291760,298000," people subscribed so let me quickly acknowledge the subs uh let me click on the subs so the big"
298000,303760," uh the big big guy one thank you so much for tier one subscription it was four days ago but i mean the"
303760,309680," twitch shows me that so i might as well acknowledge that tverskaya thank you so much for tier one"
309680,317680," subscription thank you thank you thank you and shy uh resubscribe with tier one um with a message oi"
317680,323120," um oh indeed thank you thank you so much for for resubscription marcio netto thank you so much for"
323120,327920," tier one subscription a great weekend to everyone thank you a great weekend to you as well"
328800,334880," so function thank you so much for 47 month of tier one subscription holy the og of this channel with"
334880,344880," the message raii lip and by the way so there i recently created another option to support me so you"
344880,352160," can find more details by doing the uh donate command but unfortunately for that option i don't have any"
352160,359200," notifications or any perks yet uh right so i apologize if you donated through these options"
359200,364080," and i didn't acknowledge that uh in the future i will set up something to be able to acknowledge this"
364080,371440," option as well uh right so let's go ahead and take a look at this ray leap as far as i know i do not have"
371440,377120," a ray leap installed on my system so one of the things we'll probably have to do we'll probably have to"
377920,383680," build it from scratch luckily it's a very simple uh it's a very simple library so it should be"
383680,388800," relatively easy to do so right so let's actually clone the source code and build it from scratch"
388800,395440," so i wonder maybe i already have the source code somewhere here no i don't okay so the lip clone and"
395440,401840," let's clone it uh this is not particularly what i wanted i'm not really sure what the was that um"
404160,410560," git clone it just like yeah it clones something weird uh yeah there we go so and i like to do"
410560,415920," a shallow clone right so essentially we have like thousand yes six thousand commits in here i don't"
415920,423600," want to like clone uh all of these six thousand commits uh right so i'm going to just do depth equal one"
423600,430640," um so isn't it header only no it is not unfortunately right it has its own build system and stuff like that"
431280,439680," build dot zig is it written in zig these days uh okay uh and that's that's the whole thing i suppose"
439680,446960," so that's that's kind of interesting so how much zig is there uh not that much actually right so it's"
446960,455680," primarily c but they're using zika as a build system okay fair sure why not but uh does it have any other"
455680,459360," options yeah let's have cmake so we'll be able to probably build with cmake"
459360,472640," okay so let's actually go in here and uh okay so that's cool make dir uh build uh cmake and let's do this"
472640,480400," i probably want to install it locally and to install this thing locally i probably need to set up the"
480400,487360," installation prefix but i don't remember how to do that uh cmake set prefix so let me quickly actually"
487360,496240," just so cmake install prefix okay can i just do something like dcmake install uh install prefix"
496240,502640," right essentially it's a prefix for the path where all the installation is going to happen right so and"
502640,508720," we're going to install it at home opt array lib right so these days i kind of like to install the"
508720,514400," things that i build from scratch like for a local user uh right without using root or anything like"
514400,520480," that so maybe it results with a lot of waste if you're using multiple users i think but i kind of"
520480,526320," like it right so the fact that you don't have to use any uh like root and don't have to worry about"
526320,531440," breaking something it's actually kind of nice uh right so i think it's kind of cool so as far as"
531440,536800," i know cmake uh actually caches all of that in a cache right so we can try to find the prefix and here"
536800,542720," is the prefix it actually set it up uh correctly right so let's go ahead and just build all of that"
542720,548640," with three threads even though i can do five i usually do five because i have four uh four hyper"
548640,553200," threads on my machine so i i'm going to use three because i'm streaming right now so i don't want to"
553200,559120," you know spend all of the resources on building this entire thing so how are you guys are doing"
559120,563920," how are you guys are doing while while we are building this scheisse"
563920,574720," i have four cores so i do five threads lol yeah so that's usually a recommendation right so it's a"
574720,582160," it's the usual recommendation that uh to spawn uh n plus one threads right if you have like n"
582160,589200," cores or n hyper threats like the most optimal thing is to do n plus one but i don't know the"
589200,594160," justification of that you know best practice right this is something that i heard and this is something"
594160,599440," that i do as a reflex right so if anybody more knowledgeable than me can explain why it is like"
599440,608640," that so feel free to to tell me um i do to end because i want my cores to work for their money"
608640,619360," you should have two gb of ram per threads as well oh yeah that's true yeah since i have eight"
619360,621760," eight ram eight gigabytes of ram so that makes sense"
621760,631840," all right so it looks like this entire thing built successfully which is kind of cool so i'll go ahead"
631840,640400," and install this entire thing uh yep so and it installed it in the local thing imagine right so this is where"
640400,648240," it's installed it uh let me go to ray lip and it's actually very small even though it's not header only"
648240,656160," it consists of three headers a single static library and a bunch of cmake scripts and also"
656160,660880," package config scripts which which could be actually very useful in the future so this is the entire library"
661600,669920," actually um so yeah that's pretty cool i really like the simplicity of this library even though"
669920,676320," it's not as simple as stb for instance it's still very very simple so one of the things i want to do"
676320,683280," before i go and try to visualize this entire stuff um i'm wanna try some sort of like a hello world for"
683280,689440," really do i already have some stuff for really yeah i will already tried raylib uh some time ago right"
689440,696560," so in 2021 so two years ago right so already kind of familiar with this library but i want to try to"
696560,703680," uh do this thing again right so i'm gonna remove it ray uh lib uh prob right because i forgot everything"
703680,713520," what i did with this library so um okay so let's include std.h i'm not sure how useful that is for"
713520,718880," specifically raylib and maybe let's take a look at some of the examples that are available within the"
718880,726560," raylib itself right so if you go to software and uh raylib so there's some examples in here"
726560,731520," so what kind of examples we have so there's a lot of stuff in here so i want to take a look at the core"
731520,735520," is there something like a basic um right"
735520,741120," basic window yeah there we go let's actually start with a basic window"
741680,749040," uh okay so you just have to include raylib uh so here's the entry point so you initialize the window"
749040,756880," right to create this entire thing you set you cap uh your fps to 60 fps right so because you're running"
756880,763040," only on the console of course that's what you have to do uh i and my keyboard has that yet again mate"
764000,772000," yeah damn it all right so we cap it uh cap it to 60 fps and then we organize the event loop right while"
772000,779680," window is not closed yet right so we begin drawing we begin drawing we clear the background draw some text"
779680,789200," and the drawing and then once the window is closed we close the window well i mean it's not really um when"
789200,795840," it's closed when it should close i suppose like this and i think contains like an event loop right it it"
795840,801920," basically drains all the events from the from the event queue uh right and one of the events that you"
801920,809920," can receive is probably like the user request to close the uh the window right and only then uh you handle a"
809920,815520," request and then you just return so this is actually straightforward like everything that you want to do is"
816480,822640," expressed with a single function call right so this is kind of cool one of the criticisms i heard"
822640,831200," for raylib is um its functions don't have any prefixes and since it's a like a c only library"
831200,836480," uh there is no name spaces in here like in c++ or anything like that so their names kind of pollute"
836480,843120," uh your current namespace right so i think this is like the main criticism of this library that i heard"
843120,849520," it just like basically says that's it you can't have function in your entire application called"
849520,855120," init window and it's a very generic like name that you may want to have or may not i don't really know"
855120,863520," or something like begin drawing like you can't have that uh though maybe it's kind of remedied by the"
863520,868560," fact that they're using pascal case and pascal case is very unusual for a c program"
869200,875680," um that's actually very interesting i was thinking why do they use a pascal case and this is something"
875680,881280," that they actually emphasize in their sort of like a marketing speech if you know what i mean so if you"
881280,890320," take a look at them at the header of this thing uh raylib include uh raylib pascal kit yeah there we go"
890320,900640," so it's plain c code but it uses pascal case right so which is kind of unusual like a c library using"
900640,906960," pascal case and maybe that's literally the reason because it wants to have like a very simple very"
906960,913760," readable names uh but having a prefix for namespace purposes actually ruins that uh but you want to have"
913760,918480," some sort of a name spacing so that's a very interesting idea i never thought about that"
918480,928080," yeah so using keys as a way of name spacing your library this is actually kind of cool i never thought"
928080,936800," about it uh yeah that makes sense right because if you are a c programmer and you want to have a function"
936800,942480," right you want to have a function uh called begin drawing you're probably not going to case it like"
942480,946640," that you're probably going to case it like like begin drawing so that's how you sort of like a"
946640,953840," namespace that that's very interesting that's something to think about so to speak that is"
953840,961280," something to uh think about so we'll get more subs we'll get more subs thank you so much uh mfamilybg"
961280,966400," for tier one subscription thank you thank you thank you uh xeons thank you so much for twitch prime and"
966400,971360," rebbe rigor thank you so much for a tier one uh subscription thank you thank you thank you really"
971360,976640," appreciate all the subs even though i don't get any money from that but there is an option from which i"
976640,984560," can get some money just check out the donate command so yeah uh anyways so let's actually go ahead and try"
984560,991600," to use this into a library let's actually do include ray leap dot h because that's what this example"
991600,997600," recommends you to do there is a lot of comments in here which makes it readable which makes it difficult to"
997600,1004000," read so can i do uh toggle truncate lines yeah there we go so basically it's not going to wrap around"
1004000,1012720," anymore okay so let's have screen width and screen height so i probably want to have something yeah i"
1012720,1018880," think yeah i think i want to have this kind of resolution i think it makes more sense uh all right"
1018880,1030480," so here uh this is a ray lib uh what i want to put in here your mom right as usual classic so now let's"
1030480,1039280," cap the fps to 60 right so we're capping this stuff to 69 to 60 i wanted to say to 60 uh all right so while"
1039840,1048720," uh window should not close uh what are we doing is we beginning the drawing right so begin the drawing"
1048720,1055280," begin drawing right so maybe i'm going to put a scope in here to have some sort of indentation right so and"
1055280,1064560," then we end the drawing process uh clear background and we have to supply ray white right whatever that"
1064560,1070240," means i don't really know what that means maybe it's a custom color it's a specifically like um you"
1070240,1076160," know the white that is used throughout the this website because it's not really like pure white"
1076160,1081680," right it's a little bit grayish so to speak maybe that's that's the color maybe that's what it is so and"
1081680,1087760," let's actually draw the text uh right so let's see how we can draw the text so we have to provide some"
1087760,1094800," numbers so i suppose this is width and height or maybe x and y and this is the size and this is the"
1094800,1102560," color white white gray okay so let's actually go ahead and do that like your mom uh so here i actually"
1102560,1109680," want to do something like a screen width divided by two and screen uh height divided by two so the size"
1109680,1120080," is going to be let's say 69 like gray uh right so and the last thing we have to do is just close the"
1120080,1130800," window to be fair this thing already feels more simple than even simp i'm sorry john but yeah"
1131920,1144640," this is actually simpler simpler than simp uh um all right so again so i just nuked myself out of the"
1144640,1154160," jibet please don't show that to john uh all right so let's actually create a build uh sh right so and"
1154160,1163600," let's do bin s yeah what the is going on so if i try to do something like clang oh main main.c this"
1163600,1171600," entire thing is definitely not going to work right because you need to supply some uh some flags right"
1171600,1176400," so that's very important so let's actually observe that so as you can see it doesn't even know where"
1176400,1182880," raylib is located so usually what i do i just use package config to get that information right so i just do"
1182880,1189920," raylib and i say give me the c flags right give me the c flags but one of the problems here in here is"
1189920,1198640," that it cannot find raylib.pc which has all the descriptions of the flags and libs and stuff like"
1198640,1205920," that but this entire thing is located within uh sort of the installation that we have in here so if we do"
1205920,1212720," grab actually we need to find file with that specific name and here it is it is located within the"
1212720,1219040," lib package config blah blah blah blah blah blah blah right and here we have all of the flags so uh"
1219040,1228000," if i remember correctly package config right had some sort of a like um variable yeah package config path"
1228000,1235760," right so one of the things we can do in here in the build sh uh we can just say okay so package config is"
1235760,1247920," essentially at home opt ray lib right opt ray lib and it's located somewhere in lib uh package config yeah"
1247920,1255920," there we go so uh let's actually put this stuff in here so it should now kind of work right so and if"
1255920,1265920," we let's actually put it in here package config uh c flags um package config flags array right and if i"
1265920,1271280," try to build this entire thing there we go it actually printed the flags right so it provided the"
1271280,1277280," include flag uh so we should be able to find everything so what we can do now uh we can take this entire"
1277280,1283360," thing and shove it into the command line of the compilation so now it will be able to find this entire stuff"
1283360,1290080," right so but as you can see it can the linker now complains that it cannot find these uh these sort of"
1290080,1298640," functions to fix that we can also query package configs and say give me the libs right so give me the flags"
1298640,1305280," necessary to link uh with this specific library uh right and here are the flags so it gives you the path"
1305280,1311440," to the libraries right so in here and the flag that tells you to to link all of that uh right and we"
1311440,1317120," want to put that stuff somewhere in here so it's not particularly convenient to put this entire stuff"
1317120,1322240," inside of the build script one of the things i usually like to do right one of the things i usually"
1322240,1327920," like to do is to have sort of like an environment uh an environment script right as you can see i have"
1327920,1334320," that environment script for uh for free type and what this environment script does essentially it sets"
1334320,1339600," all the necessary environment variables for this thing to work uh right so and i want to create a"
1339600,1345360," similar thing for raylib so let's actually create a raylib.env and this is where i'm going to move this"
1345360,1352560," entire thing so and how do i usually use this kind of environment environment scripts right so uh i do"
1353360,1361760," source which basically uh right executes uh everything in inside of that script in the current"
1361760,1368480," shell session so that means if i do end end and build it will automatically work as you can see it"
1368480,1372960," automatically worked so the linker still complains about some other functions but it doesn't really"
1372960,1380560," matter uh right so and why do i want to do it like that uh so the problem is that somebody may have"
1380560,1385920," uh raylib installed in a different place and somebody may have even really been installed system-wide"
1385920,1390320," right so they don't really need any of these kind of tricks or anything like that so we want to have"
1390320,1395680," like a build script that works pretty much for majority of the cases but at the same time i have my own"
1395680,1401120," custom environment and for my own custom environment i have this separate script uh right so this is"
1401120,1408960," basically how i do that so this is the brain damage that i got from using nixos for five years yes i've been"
1408960,1415520," using nixos for five years and this is a thing in nixos uh which is basically you have uh packages that"
1415520,1420880," are installed in separate uh you know folders and then you have sort of like a system that builds up"
1420880,1425440," the environment out of these packages setting up the environment variables and also simnix and stuff like"
1425440,1431440," that and that damaged my brain irreversibly and that's why i'm doing these things like that since then"
1431440,1433920," even though i don't use nixos anymore so"
1433920,1443440," it makes sense so yeah anyway so we've got even more subs uh we've got even more subs"
1443440,1450880," um so i don't remember i think i already acknowledged ribiro gore uh thank you xenos ribiro gore thank you"
1450880,1456880," thank you thank you thank you xia yang thank you so much for 47 months of tier 2 subscription another og of"
1456880,1463520," this channel uh with the message i hope mr jeffrey basis appreciates my money i don't know if he does"
1463520,1469520," but i do appreciate your intent thank you so much thank you thank you thank you maybe one day i'll uh get"
1469520,1476640," uh those money we'll see we'll see uh thank you so much mike rosoft for a tier one subscription with the message"
1476640,1484240," at sodium cool that is sodium a cool indeed that is a sodium echo okay so it still complains about some"
1484240,1491760," other shise so let's uh see what is it complaining about so it cannot find things like a security f and"
1491760,1499280," since f and we know what that is that is basically the uh mathematical library right so and now it complains"
1499280,1506560," about something from glfw so let's actually also link it with glfw uh right and it still complains about"
1507200,1515280," dl close so if i remember correctly like dl stuff is located in dl so you have to do ldl right so"
1515280,1521920," and now it complains about pthreads okay that is interesting so it also wants to have like a pthreads"
1521920,1529760," uh let's link it with pthreads why not and now we compile would you look at that we managed to compile"
1529760,1537680," it and if i run the center i think it says your mom that's it we successfully build ray deep from scratch"
1537680,1547680," and we successfully used it so that's actually kind of cool i really like that uh so yes it's not really"
1547680,1554400," centered properly because it like renders it like that in here but so what i really care uh in our specific"
1554400,1560480," case what i really care about in our specific case is how can you draw the circles right so let's"
1560480,1566160," actually take a look at uh the header right so as far as i know you only have like three headers"
1566160,1574320," so the main thing is in raylib uh do you have circles my phone uh okay so there is a draw circle"
1574320,1581760," uh let's actually put it in here so because that's what the neural network visualization consists of"
1581760,1587680," right it consists of circles so center where are we going to put the center on uh let's actually put it"
1587680,1595680," add uh screen width divided by two and screen uh height divided by two so the radius is going to be"
1595680,1603200," 100 and the color i want to have like a red color uh but i'm not sure do we have the colors somewhere"
1603200,1611440," oh there we go so there's literally a red in here um right so yeah that's kind of obnoxious right"
1611440,1619280," so imagine the library actually taking away from you the word the red um so that's okay okay i mean"
1619280,1625360," you can always undef it if you don't like it but it's just like uh anyway so let's actually try to"
1625360,1633360," draw the circle i'm going to command this thing out and i'm going to build uh main and it's oh yeah so"
1633360,1641200," also one of the things i have to do i have to do the source uh opt uh array environment and there we go"
1641200,1645120," so that works that's a flag of japan how about that"
1645120,1657680," so that's pretty cool no anti-aliasing what the fuck absolutely disgusting literally unusable literally"
1657680,1664400," and i'm joking actually but you mean it's fine it's actually pretty cool i think so what does it use"
1664400,1672480," for um for drawing actually right i think it's uses opengl right so let me actually see so if i take a"
1672480,1683120," look at op team actually uh software raylib let me find the implementation of the draw circle let's"
1683120,1693200," so let's do draw circle holy shit okay um so draw circle i actually only care about the draw circle"
1693200,1700960," like just draw circle so i don't think it's that much so okay so there is this thing and it just calls"
1700960,1708640," the function draw circle v right so try to find that draw circle sector uh what do we have in here and"
1708640,1715920," okay so we have segments and stuff like that um okay we have rlb okay this is actually interesting"
1715920,1725840," this is not the jl it's rl uh right it's okay this feels like immediate mode opengl but it's this is"
1725840,1734480," not opengl this is a custom thing uh right so that's actually kind of cool right so let's actually find"
1734480,1741280," a real i think i know so there is a flat there is a header in here called rlgl uh so maybe that's"
1741280,1746000," what it is and a multi opengl abstraction layer with immediate mode style okay so that's actually"
1746000,1756800," kind of cool so a row begin initialize okay wait does it use opengl literally uses opengl 1.1"
1758000,1763840," uh it's actually full okay it's actually fallback so maybe there is a different version uh okay so"
1763840,1768000," there is a different version in here and in a different version it uses like a different thing"
1768000,1773840," it uses a custom renderer with batches and stuff like that okay so that makes sense it's kind of"
1773840,1782240," cool so if you run this thing on opengl 1.1 uh it uses the immediate mode opengl 1.1 like 1.1 but"
1782240,1789200," if you have a higher opengl it just basically adapts that stuff uh right so that's actually kind of cool"
1789200,1803600," um okay so that's kind of cool uh all right so um what i want you to do actually um so let's actually go"
1803600,1816720," ahead and like initialize this entire thing um in the nn.h right so we have visualization in the header"
1816720,1822720," right so we have the visualization in the header um so we have the renderer in here right so and what i"
1822720,1831920," want to do in here i want to actually port this piece of code to uh ray leap right uh so how can we"
1831920,1837680," even do all of that so uh all right so i'm going to go and just open this in there i think so what's"
1837680,1843440," going to be the resolution of the screen so we already kind of have the resolution here so we have image"
1843440,1849520," width and image height which is something that we can use in here uh right so i'm going to start"
1849520,1857840," initializing these things in here so here we're going to do header uh right set target fps uh"
1857840,1866480," right so this is going to be 60 um but the question is at which point we're going to be initializing all"
1866480,1873920," that right because here is the thing here is the thing so we have like a bunch of iterations in here"
1873920,1881040," right we have a bunch of iterations but then we need to organize some sort of an event loop right we need"
1881040,1889840," to organize a sort of event loop and when do we do one single iteration like a backpropagation"
1889840,1900720," right when do we do that um so maybe we should actually run the training process in a separate thread"
1902800,1907120," that sounds like a good idea believe it or not i think like running this entire stuff in a separate"
1907120,1914640," thread uh could be an interesting idea so and then in like the event loop in the current thread"
1914640,1920560," basically periodically like looks at the state of the neural network and just like draws that state"
1920560,1929920," specifically um right but maybe i'm gonna do that um a little bit later right so let's actually try to"
1929920,1939200," do that a little bit later so what i want to do for now is maybe just like transform this entire thing"
1939200,1947600," into an event loop right so let's just transform it into an event loop uh and see how it is going to go"
1947600,1950240," right so let me go here"
1952800,1960800," so we're going to have while window should close right so we're not going to do any uh login in here"
1960800,1966880," so i want to actually remove all of the logging so here we have like saving to like a separate file"
1966880,1973040," i'm not sure if that's very useful so we probably want to we probably want to do the rendering in here"
1973040,1979360," instead right so that's probably what we want to do we want to do the rendering here uh and uh we're not"
1979360,1983040," gonna we're not gonna be using finite differences anymore because they're very slow so we're only"
1983040,1990560," gonna uh like lean towards back propagation so that's what we're gonna be doing uh okay so maybe"
1990560,1994400," what i'm gonna be doing is essentially"
1994400,2002560," just have it like so right and maybe we're gonna have like a i in here which is initially zero"
2002640,2012000," uh if i is less than 5000 we're gonna do back propagation and uh learn and increment"
2012000,2020160," i by one right essentially if it goes over 5000 iterations right so it will stop learning it will"
2020160,2026560," start stop doing things right and in here what we probably want to do uh we want to"
2027440,2033840," do the actual rendering right so let's do uh begin drawing uh let's also clear the background"
2033840,2041680," and end the drawing right but on top of that on top of that i want to do something like maybe"
2041680,2050160," um and then render ray leader right and what i want to pass in here i want to pass the neural network"
2050160,2055920," right so and as you can see it's already kind of like a name spaces the uh the function calls right"
2055920,2062320," because everything in my application uses the snake case uh but the ray leap uses the pascal case and"
2062320,2068880," that's a very interesting way of like yeah name spacing this entire thing uh right so that's actually"
2068880,2075920," kind of cool okay so what i want to do is basically copy paste this entire thing uh this entire rendering that"
2075920,2083760," we used with olivec and i'm gonna just remove it right so this is gonna be simply arraylib uh look"
2083760,2089840," at that by the way we already have a field maybe that means i need to remove clear background right and"
2089840,2098560," just like use the background color in here uh okay so we want to actually port um the colors here as well"
2098560,2105680," right i want to like render it similarly to how we render these images in here right so yeah so i want like"
2105680,2111280," to use even to use even the same colors in here i think that makes sense uh so to do that we'll probably"
2111280,2122880," have to do the the usual thing all right so we need to find the colors we need to find the colors okay"
2122880,2125440," so how they defined collateral"
2129200,2134720," what the fuck is clitoral"
2134720,2143040," ah i'm 13 it's probably it stands for c literal"
2143040,2159120," why is this so funny um so yeah okay so c plus plot doesn't support compound literal"
2159200,2163600," and okay i see what they're trying to do in here it's just like a difference between c and c plus plus"
2163600,2167360," so"
2167360,2174480," jesus what a name okay"
2179520,2188560," uh okay so um and uh so this is essentially yeah uh it's basically designate initializer or something"
2188560,2196000," like that and for the color right so where the color is defined so do we have like um maybe color yeah"
2196000,2204640," there we go so you have rgba okay that makes sense so uh what i usually like to do uh right so here we're"
2204640,2209920," going to have a color and again okay so it like literally took away the name color"
2209920,2218240," i'm not a really big fan of this kind of stuff but yeah uh so this is going to be 18"
2218240,2223200," uh 18 and just f f so that's the color we're going to have in here"
2224080,2229920," uh so this is a low color which is basically purple right so if i'm not mistaken"
2229920,2239360," so in here we actually put the alpha to zero because of how we blend things but maybe um"
2239360,2244800," maybe ray leap has a better way of blending things so we're not going to do that in here like that"
2245360,2253440," so this is going to be ff uh this one is zero uh f f f f there we go and"
2253440,2261120," so this is going to be so the high color was actually green right so that means we have to do something"
2261120,2270800," like this uh and this is going to be alpha maybe i want to even do a line uh there we go and then i can"
2270800,2279920," say um clear background and i can just set the background color there we go so isn't that poggers"
2279920,2286160," i think it's pretty freaking poggers okay so let's actually try to compile this i think and i'm pretty"
2286160,2293520," sure it's going to complain in all of the places uh where we need to change things right so let's go and"
2293520,2300800," just do build uh so we have implicit declaration okay so essentially one of the things we'll have to do"
2300800,2310400," we'll have to do the usual setup that we established in a different build sh so we'll need to port these"
2310400,2317600," things in here uh right so let me actually do the following thing i want to have separate like variables"
2318320,2325360," c flags and libs which are going to contain all the necessary necessary flags and libs and stuff like"
2325360,2330880," that so one of the things we want to put in here is this right so that's kind of important for the"
2330880,2339520," lips we can put this stuff in here and here we're going to do c flags and uh libs and there we go"
2339520,2346160," so then later we can add all of this package config nonsense right that we established later"
2346800,2355760," earlier i mean right so and here all of the all of the libs stuff right we're already linked with p"
2355760,2361840," thread so that means it should be actually uh super easy to make the entire process multi-threaded meaning"
2361840,2367680," that uh we can learn in a separate thread and the ui thread is also a separate thing and it periodically"
2367680,2372480," just looks at the current state of the neural network and just displays it right so we already"
2372480,2379440," linked with pthread so why not just use it for for our purposes i think that makes sense so maybe here"
2379440,2385440," i want to actually put it before i enable the tracing so it doesn't really trace this entire stuff but"
2385440,2391920," maybe it doesn't really matter so it's better to trace everything just in case just in case uh all"
2391920,2396880," right so if i try to do this kind of stuff uh w all not found yeah and this is because you have to"
2396880,2404880," actually rub this entire stuff in quotes because welcome to bash uh right so welcome to bash and as"
2404880,2409760," you can see so it cannot find the railie pc because we have to use the corresponding environment all right"
2409760,2416160," so we have to do something like this on pt uh ray lead env and if i try to do it now it seems to be"
2416160,2423840," working it seems to be twerking how about that right so it cannot find image width because we don't pass any"
2423840,2429760," image here anymore right in the previous version that used olivec we actually put image in here right"
2429760,2434640," which contain the width but this one doesn't contain the width but we know the width and height of the"
2434640,2441440," window it's literally uh image width and image height right so that's basically what we have in here"
2441440,2447440," uh and might as well maybe you know i think i need to actually do query replace image width"
2448160,2455280," is image width uh there we go it's actually not that many so i suppose that's the only place where we have"
2455280,2464720," to do that so what's the other thing so here we are actually you know blending the colors and the question"
2464720,2477840," is the question is how should we blend that um so the actual sort of alpha right the actual alpha that we"
2477840,2487440," competed in here is this all right so that's the actual alpha so i suppose one of the things i can do in"
2487440,2495040," here i can just take the high color and set it alpha to this maybe even cooler just set it like this"
2495040,2504800," all right and no it doesn't really blend these two colors together that's the problem it doesn't really"
2504800,2510480," blend it because we're not drawing them on top of each other so we need to find something that would blend"
2510480,2521120," this entire stuff so raylib include so do you have anything for blended the colors i actually kind of doubt"
2521120,2531680," that uh blending okay so there are blending modes uh but how do you use that okay blend begin blend mode"
2531680,2548640," and blend mode color get ssc alpha blended into dst color with tint not i don't quite understand"
2548640,2557040," why do you need to do tint in here right but that kind of looks like what we need is there any other"
2557040,2565120," blends no this is the only thing in here um if i see alpha blended so this is the source into dst color"
2565120,2576240," with tint so because i don't really need tint right color tint color maybe there is something like mix"
2576240,2586400," no this is there's only blend uh so color alpha blend set the color alpha aligned so i kind of want to"
2586400,2597360," take a look at how exactly this entire thing implemented right so let's uh do this thing uh so"
2597360,2600160," include where was that"
2600160,2609040," i think it's in src right there we go right"
2609040,2615760," yeah so essentially what i want to find i want to find the implementation of that specific function"
2615760,2625680," right so let's actually try to find this kind of stuff right let's try to find uh so our textures"
2625680,2635840," all right so what we're doing here we're essentially uh adding the tint we're multiplying this thing"
2635840,2639040," by the tint plus one"
2644720,2654160," and then i suppose we're blending all of that so if i set the tint to zero right if i set the tint to zero"
2654160,2662560," that just means that it will be added to one right it will be added one and then multiply by this"
2662560,2671440," entire thing using the original color right so that's what i think it will do but at the same time it also"
2671440,2679760," shifts this entire stuff by eight which doesn't make much sense to me at all"
2679760,2684160," like why do you shift it down like that"
2684160,2691200," um so let me let me see so this is integer all right"
2693120,2700800," so maybe what we have to do is use the white tint right"
2700800,2712560," use the white tint and essentially that will kind of overflow and we'll end up with the same color"
2712560,2720400," it's kind of the excuse me so i have this sort of idea yeah i think using white pure white is"
2721280,2729040," um is the way to go so it's actually quickly do that uh how are we going to be doing all that so um i"
2729040,2737680," think this is where setting the um the alpha to zero could be actually useful right so this is where"
2738320,2747280," so the destination color um yeah i think i can set it as the low color right and this one could be a high"
2747280,2752800," color and the tint uh i'm going to set the tint to white it doesn't even have the white that's that's"
2752800,2764240," the good question right do we have a ray lib dot h uh white white yeah okay so and uh ray white is sort of"
2764240,2770720," like a different white my my own white red lip logo okay that makes sense uh i can't get over this"
2770720,2776880," goddamn freaking clear i'm i swear to god this is done intentionally uh this is done intentionally"
2776880,2779840," i can't wait"
2779840,2784720," anyway i'm sorry"
2784720,2789920," again i'm 13 like i just like i don't know why it makes me laugh so much"
2790560,2796880," uh so this is the color and we blended this entire thing and here we're trying to draw a line okay so"
2796880,2802880," that kind of makes sense right so that kind of makes sense so this is a connection color so probably"
2802880,2810320," doesn't doesn't remember and might as well just set this entire stuff like this right so this is a high"
2810320,2818480," color uh then we blend and that creates a new color right so that creates a new color that we can then use for"
2818480,2825600," the uh for the uh for the line so how do you draw a line can i just do draw a line perfect perfection"
2825600,2835680," okay so and essentially this is where i can put that color right so and we're starting to draw"
2837840,2852000," since uh cx1 c y1 cx2 c y2 there we go so we just ported this entire step just ported this entire step"
2852000,2858960," uh all right uh okay so how can we build this entire thing all right"
2862000,2866800," okay so this is a similar situation right very much similar situation and i think"
2866800,2874080," i'm going to simply copy paste this entire stuff so here we're drawing circle right so let me grab draw"
2874080,2880720," circle we already know that drawing circles actually works uh right it actually works"
2882480,2887600," and so here we're doing the neural color color right so that means"
2887600,2902400," neuron color low color honestly i think a neuron color uh and where is the neuron color i can't spell it"
2902400,2910400," neuron color yeah it's just like literally low color yeah it doesn't really matter uh so here what we have to do"
2910400,2917680," it's a high color uh this is the alpha of that thing um"
2917680,2927680," i'm an idiot so i'm actually modifying the wrong thing i'm modifying the wrong freaking function wait what"
2927680,2935440," i'm modifying the wrong thing all along okay so i'm going crazy so it's a completely different thing right"
2937920,2948000," oh boy uh all right so let me bring the draw circle back in here uh so i'm gonna move this into i think"
2948000,2954080," so we're blending the colors uh so this is the alpha we don't really need that"
2954080,2960480," and the only thing we need in here is the color blend uh i'm gonna put this stuff in here"
2961520,2971840," so c x1 right so c x1 right so this is c x1 c y1 and in terms of the uh radius we have a neuron"
2971840,2978320," radius right so this is a neuron radius so that's what we have in here so"
2978320,2989360," uh-huh and for this center i think we just use gray right we just use gray and let me maybe go ahead and"
2989360,2995120," express that so maybe it's just like literally gonna be gray so that means the the color scheme is not"
2995120,2999680," going to be precisely the same but it's going to be close right it's going to be kind of close"
3000640,3010320," uh all right so what else do we have in here so um and declared identifier j are you serious"
3010320,3019280," why it works in here then did they accidentally remove something"
3021200,3029040," oh yeah i see so this is because yeah we should have not copy pasted it like so"
3029040,3036000," uh so this is a j yeah just a second"
3036000,3043440," i need to go here and that's the actual value that i have to put in here"
3044880,3050160," uh so i think that is going to work now at least here um"
3050160,3054160," and this is"
3054160,3064880," yeah we don't have to okay so i'm having a lot of brain farts but that's fine uh okay so this is screen"
3064880,3072640," width it has to be image width uh image height all right and is it going to work i think it's going to"
3072640,3083280," work yeah there we go so it works uh but it complains about like stb stuff uh not really sure"
3083280,3092640," multiple oh okay that's actually kind of cool ray lib is using stb image right"
3094000,3099840," so we can't link it with stb image luckily we don't really have to right since we're"
3099840,3105600," migrating to ray lib uh right we we don't really need that stuff anymore so we can just basically remove"
3105600,3113280," this thing uh right so let's go ahead and do that and that should be fine now yeah let it go"
3113280,3119920," so so let's actually try to run this entire thing so let me double check"
3120720,3126800," if it's going to work properly uh and how exactly is it going to work it's going to be rolling slow"
3126800,3135440," uh learning slower it's going to be learning at 60 fps imagine a neural network that is learning at 60 fps"
3135440,3139280," isn't that poggers i think that's pretty freaking progress okay so i'm going to try to run it"
3139280,3146080," and is it doing things it's kind of hard to tell like i don't see it doing anything"
3147040,3154000," uh but yeah oh this is actually kind of cool so once we close it it will try to verify it and just"
3154000,3159520," confirm that it it's actually doing something okay so we can't really see if it's doing anything"
3159520,3167600," right so maybe one of the things we have to do in here we have to print uh the cost the cost function"
3167600,3175920," of this entire thing so let's do nn cost uh and i don't quite remember nn.h uh and then cost right so it"
3175920,3181760," accepts the neural network and the input and output in here there we go so let's actually go ahead and"
3181760,3187680," just try to do that so we're going to be building and then running the entire thing uh so yeah we just"
3187680,3192080," need to see if it actually doing something well it's it's actually kind of doing something but now it's"
3192080,3201840," stuck um i wonder why right it's probably because this entire thing is dumb right that's kind of weird"
3203440,3209280," uh it should be actually way better uh let's remove some of the like internal things maybe this is"
3209280,3217840," because it's like too many internal layers that's probably the problem here um all right so is it going"
3217840,3225360," down i think yeah i think something is actually yeah there we go so they are appearing yo this is so cool"
3225360,3232480," look at that it is learning it's actually changing its weights and biases that is so cool"
3232480,3242640," and we can see that in real time we're literally seeing that in real time this is so freaking cool"
3245040,3254720," um um yeah okay so then we can uh probably close let's actually wait until it actually gets to a decent"
3254720,3263280," level so we since we have a ui now since we have a ui we can actually uh plot the the cost function"
3263280,3273760," somehow right so we can actually plot it all right so now if i close this entire thing it's going to"
3273760,3281040," verify it and say that it's totally okay all right so now we're able to actually like render this entire"
3281040,3288400," thing in real time without like uh you know taking the snapshots or anything like that right so we can just"
3288400,3296880," do it like this um right so and that means we don't really need olivec so we only need the nn.h and raylib"
3296880,3302960," uh and there we go so i'm going to just try to recompile this into i think so yeah it will require"
3302960,3311200," probably remove a couple of things in here um yeah i don't know and now it is going man this is so freaking"
3311200,3321760," cool i love it you you can like literally see how it's just like uh you know gets to some point right"
3321760,3331520," so as far as i know like the um the purple ones are the ones that are sort of get disabled right because"
3331520,3340240," the closer it is to zero the more it's disabled maybe we can even try to sort of like emphasize that by"
3340240,3347040," using literally a gray color for the low color that's one of the things we can try to do uh"
3347040,3354320," right so let's actually quickly try to do that uh yeah so initially everything is sort of like a green"
3354320,3361280," and then some of them are going to get disabled right so they're slowly getting disabled uh right and"
3361280,3367120," that creates sort of like a certain pathways wasn't minus one it is able to we're using sigmoid"
3367120,3375280," activation right so um well no really so maybe it's not particularly representative of what's going"
3375280,3383840," on in here oh yeah so grayish means they're negative right grayish means they're negative"
3387360,3390960," all right all right but maybe it would be better to just keep purple i think purple was a little bit"
3390960,3401200," better um okay so but here is the interesting thing so the nn dot h and n dot h is supposed to be"
3401200,3407280," header only library right so but to have this sort of visualization stuff"
3408160,3414640," we need a whole freaking dependency in in like in terms of ray lib uh which doesn't really make any"
3414640,3422160," sense uh what i'm thinking is that what if the visualization tool is going to be a separate"
3422720,3429920," self-contained program specifically for training neural networks here's an interesting thing uh"
3429920,3435600," what what i noticed while making the neural networks with an n dot h is that uh the structure"
3435600,3442000," of the program ends up being the same it literally ends up ends up being the same so you have some"
3442000,3449200," training data right so then you allocate a bunch of neural networks uh right with a certain architecture"
3449200,3455600," and then you just have a loop that trains this entire thing what if we turn this entire stuff"
3455600,3461280," into like a self-contained application where you can customize all of that stuff where you can say"
3461280,3467120," okay here is the file with the training data here is the description of the architecture of the neural"
3467120,3473360," network right so basically a bunch of numbers like that indicate the sizes of the of the layers"
3473360,3479120," go ahead and train that neural network on that data and it will just start visualization"
3479200,3483840," right it will show how the architecture that you described actually like evolves and stuff like"
3483840,3491440," that and then it saves the trained neural network on the hard drive uh where you can then take that"
3491440,3500080," neural network load it into your custom program and integrate it and uh use it right so in that regard"
3500080,3505600," an n dot h can be used for integrating these neural networks that are trained by this sort of"
3505600,3511360," like separate application and that separate application also uses an n dot h does it make"
3511360,3519120," sense right so uh let's actually uh come up with the name for such application so we're sort of like"
3519120,3523200," having a separate place for training neural networks let's actually maybe call it like a gym"
3523200,3529360," uh dot c and it's going to be the graphical application that just like shows the training process right"
3530080,3537200," uh so yeah essentially like i'm going to outline the basic architecture that i sort of like envision"
3537200,3549440," uh sort of like envision so i started my paint okay so here it is so essentially we have an n um just a second"
3552080,3564160," and an n dot h right so this is basically the header only library then uh we have a gym right gym that"
3564160,3573520," uses an n dot h right that uses an n dot h but on top of that it also uses raylib raylib"
3579120,3589040," so that's what it does so uh what you do right you give it the data right you give it the data"
3589040,3596320," and the description of the architecture right so the arc uh the architecture of the neural network so you"
3596320,3603920," give all these things to the gym in the form of files maybe right so that's why i'm sort of like uh"
3603920,3607920," drawing it with the rectangles to indicate that these are not libraries these are libraries library"
3607920,3614160," dependencies and this is sort of like the files you give all of that stuff to this thing right and it"
3614160,3620960," speeds out uh a neural network in the form of a file right so in the form of a file so that's what you"
3620960,3629040," have so and it's a abstract application right that uh just you know trains your neural network and then"
3629040,3634160," you have your app right you have your app right so you have your app"
3634160,3646640," that also uses an n dot h and basically uses this trained neural network so that's basically the"
3646640,3653120," architecture that i envision right now with raylib and as you can see uh in with this kind of approach"
3653120,3661680," uh an n dot h does not depend on raylib right and uh your application also doesn't depend on raylib right"
3661680,3668880," so it's still a single header only library right so it's just it's used to create this sort of like a"
3668880,3673040," neural network and then you can integrate this thing into your application and sort of deploy"
3674080,3679680," an end of json yeah maybe it's gonna be an end of json right who knows uh but maybe this thing should be"
3679680,3685520," like a single file uh but i don't think it's that good of an idea right i would like to separate the"
3685520,3691280," architecture and data and again i'm not an artificial intelligence person right i'm pretty sure there are"
3691280,3698080," some sort of like conventions and standard developed over the years of doing this entire stuff uh but"
3698080,3705440," that's where this entire thing sort of wants to converge if that makes any sense there is a thing"
3705440,3711520," that it keeps talking about like uh on my streams almost like all the time is that when you're developing"
3711520,3717920," a certain application your source code sort of wants to converge to a certain architecture"
3718480,3725360," it's sort of like the requirements of the application dictate the architecture of the of the entire thing"
3725360,3732400," if you know what i mean right so you basically have requirements and you start iterating on these"
3732400,3737920," requirements and the code base sort of emerges all out of the requirements and what's interesting is that"
3737920,3746400," it's kind of similar to how the neural network learn you know so you have the data and you're just"
3746400,3751600," trying to optimize the cost function and by trying to optimize the cost function on that specific data"
3751600,3758720," a certain architecture just emerges out of nowhere and it's kind of similar right so it's just like"
3758720,3769440," you are the thing that you can view your code base as the neural network right as some sort of a model and"
3769440,3775520," you are training it on the requirements and by trying to fit this entire thing to requirements a certain"
3775520,3783600," architecture emerges right which is kind of like yeah it's kind of like similar in a sense"
3783600,3787680," if you know what i mean does it make sense does everything i say make sense right"
3787680,3794640," and that's why when you're trying to architect up front it rarely works because whatever you're"
3794640,3799440," trying to architect up front doesn't really correspond to the reality doesn't correspond to the requirements"
3803440,3809680," mm-hmm it's not by itself but it's a very similar process yeah yeah so it's not by itself but it feels"
3809680,3816800," like it it's doing by itself if you programmed long enough and you programmed like uh very complex"
3816800,3825200," applications you probably know that sometimes the code just wants to do its own thing like you are of"
3825200,3830320," course you are modifying the code you are like the the programmer you are in control of these things but"
3830320,3838480," sometimes it feels like you're very limited in terms of what you can do and those limitations kind of give"
3838480,3847200," the code the character if that makes any sense so it's just like codes wants to do its own thing right"
3849440,3858480," so and at some point when you zone out and you program it feels like it's just like the code just writes itself right and it feels alive"
3862320,3872320," who's the boss of the gym that's a good question actually um who's the boss of the gym um right and the"
3872320,3877280," gym itself can also contain not only visualization of the neural network right it can also contain the"
3877280,3888560," the cost plotting right and stuff like that is it whiskey no it's a green tea it's actually long tea right so i don't drink alcohol at all"
3891440,3898800," like ai the code steals your job well nobody can steal your job if you don't have a new job"
3898800,3913120," smart right so i quit my job five years ago because because i knew the ai is coming just like billy harrington"
3913120,3920000," it's fucking coming right now right so for your job of course so let's actually"
3920000,3922400," what the fuck is wrong with me"
3922400,3922720," oh"
3922720,3925040," um"
3925040,3934880," twitch is the job but i mean it doesn't even pay right so it's just like i'm literally"
3935760,3938240," shit posting on the internet for free um"
3938240,3943440," so i literally don't have a job"
3943440,3947200," uh okay guys so"
3947200,3954000," we're gonna have raylib.h and uh let's do this kind of thing"
3957760,3969440," so okay gym is the uh is a gui app that trains your uh nn uh on"
3969440,3974560," the data on the data you give it right"
3979760,3989920," the idea is that it will spit out a binary file that can be then loaded up"
3989920,3992480," with an n.h"
3992480,4004800," and used in your application right there we go so that's basically the sort of the main idea of this entire stuff"
4006800,4010320," uh gym stands for gui your mom"
4010320,4020160," all right so what we're gonna accept in here i suppose uh we're gonna pass the"
4020160,4029920," the files with the description of the neural network and the data in the in the command line arguments"
4029920,4035200," so maybe in the future we're gonna have some sort of a ui that will let you just pick"
4036240,4040880," the file from the file system and you don't have to pass it to command line arguments but i don't"
4040880,4046560," want to research how to do that right now by the way i remember raylib had something for"
4046560,4051280," ui if i'm not mistaken oh ray gui yeah"
4051280,4053600," regu rogue"
4053600,4061600," yeah so it's a simple and easy to use immediate mode gui library uh was originally spotted by unity"
4061600,4065520," i'm gui okay unity has its own immediate gui that's very interesting so yeah"
4066000,4072080," who needs uh dear i'm gui when you have this uh where is the where is this thing"
4072080,4076560," yeah it's not pollers i think it's pretty freaking pollers look at that"
4076560,4077920," yo"
4077920,4082400," that's so cool we should definitely try that at some point"
4082400,4089200," okay but but not right now a little bit later okay so i'm gonna start copy pasting the code"
4089200,4096720," from the editor and stuff like that so obviously i'm gonna just have this thing in here right so this is"
4096720,4104880," the sizes of the window right they are super super important uh so here we have to initialize"
4104880,4112880," the window right so this is going to be gym right so this is a gym and here we are doing this kind of"
4112880,4125040," stuff um yeah it probably makes sense to also um copy paste this kind of thing right so we need to"
4126720,4129040," come up with the"
4129040,4130080," format"
4130080,4134080," on how to describe the architecture of the neural network"
4134080,4138320," the thing about the architecture of neural network at least right now is that it's just"
4138320,4142240," a sequence of numbers it's a sequence of integers i would even say"
4142240,4147360," right if you know what i mean right so essentially we could say that we have an"
4147360,4154960," adder uh right and let's call it adder dot nn or something like that and uh so we could say that"
4154960,4164400," you have like a four inputs right uh actually you need to have like four uh things in here uh because"
4164400,4170640," if first four beats are are the first number the second four beats is the first four beats is the first"
4170640,4176080," four beats is the first number and second four beats is the second number right so that that means"
4176080,4181360," that the input is going to be eight uh neurons right so then another thing we want to have in here is"
4181360,4189440," probably uh just say uh maybe 16 like uh like a hidden layer and then we're gonna have like a four"
4189440,4196400," beats as an output and plus one for the uh for the overflow beat right we need a way to describe"
4196400,4201520," this kind of stuff right but describing that with numbers as you can see is not particularly convenient"
4201520,4208240," because you kind of want to have like arithmetic operations uh just for the reason i said right so"
4208240,4214800," just for the reason i said uh because you may want to have like something like n equal to"
4214800,4220560," uh four and then you can say that the architecture of this neural network is essentially"
4220560,4228960," uh two n uh n by n and uh n plus one right so you want to be able to say something like that"
4229680,4234640," um when you're describing your neural network right because you want to kind of give the meaning to"
4234640,4240400," all of these numbers if that makes any sense so what would be the best way to actually like describe"
4240400,4245040," this entire thing so that means that the gym has to have like a simple interpreted language"
4245040,4253680," if that makes any sense right but do i really want to go that route do i really want to go that route"
4256560,4265840," i don't really know i don't really know right because it would be better if the gym was uh some sort of"
4265840,4273040," like a separate library but it depends on ray leap which makes it kind of yeah so this entire thing"
4273040,4279600," naturally wants to have uh like a scripting language right so the description of this stuff needs to be like"
4279600,4288640," flexible enough uh right let's be flexible enough but maybe for now just for now we're going to be using"
4288640,4294640," numbers right so and then later i'll see what we can do about that maybe we could uh make some sort of"
4294640,4300960," like a stack based language like a fourth style or fourth style language where i could say okay four four"
4300960,4308880," all right so basically maybe four to multiply it so this is the first thing and then four for that and"
4308880,4318160," then four one plus or something like that and then here you could say let's and be equal to four or something"
4318160,4324400," because like interpreting the stack based language is a little bit easier right but anyway so for now i'm"
4324400,4329520," going to say it's going to be eight uh sixteen and five right so the first thing we probably want to do"
4329520,4334960," in the gym uh is read this entire stuff right so we want to read this entire file"
4336720,4345520," uh ai ports it's all coming together yeah i don't know if i really want to uh develop another programming"
4345520,4354800," language but we'll see we'll see um so we need a way to maybe read entire file uh so let me go ahead"
4354800,4362640," and steal uh reading the entire file from some places i think i had that in olivec uh right so there was"
4363680,4369920," was there a written there was a right entire file uh okay so it doesn't we don't really have that in"
4369920,4377360," here so what else maybe dead right so maybe we have that stuff in the dead in a common uh read entire"
4377360,4383040," file so i'm going to actually steal this entire stuff it's actually read entire deer right so read entire"
4383040,4391520," file let's take this into i think and use a string builder which is kind of meh for our case"
4391520,4397280," right because it will require taking too many things with uh with all of that"
4397280,4405600," so do i want to really go that route so this entire thing also wants to have file size which is fine"
4405600,4408320," i can give it to it sure"
4408320,4414720," uh so this is the capacity so we just do reallocation"
4416560,4421120," yeah i don't really want to use the string builder so let me try to compile this entire thing so i'm"
4421120,4427360," going to build sh for now i'm going to just put it like that and in here we're going to just have a g"
4427360,4428640," okay"
4428640,4435360," all right so let's go through this entire stuff so if i remember correctly"
4435360,4437680," i type depth error node to integer"
4439440,4445680," what else do we have a file so that requires including stdio by the way maybe array leap has"
4445680,4453840," something uh to do with files does it have something for reading files um so file path file path this one"
4453840,4464080," is interesting okay file path load file data so this is the callback stuff uh right is there something like load file"
4464880,4471040," no um yeah i don't think it's load file data"
4471040,4480880," this is actually convenient okay so maybe we can just use this entire thing unload file it's located in load data file"
4485520,4485920," huh"
4485920,4494240," yeah so since we're using ray lib we can just use this entire thing okay so that's actually kind of cool"
4494240,4495360," uh"
4495360,4502880," let's get rid of this stuff right because it makes it even more cross-platform and everything"
4502880,4509520," i mean c is kind of already cross-platform but whatever uh so this is the buffer"
4510400,4516400," and uh we're going to provide the file name so i already have adder dot nn right so adder dot nn"
4516400,4522800," and in here we're going to have something like uh so this is unsigned integer buffer len"
4522800,4529360," and i'm going to pass this entire thing in here buffer and then so initially zero we're going to put"
4529360,4537840," the pointer in here that's actually kind of cool uh and we can do f right let me take a look at how we do"
4537840,4542800," f right in here"
4542800,4551600," adder dot arch maybe yeah we'll see i'm not really sure how exactly like what kind of extension to use"
4551600,4559680," exactly uh but maybe arch actually makes sense yeah so let's actually change it to arch yeah that makes"
4559680,4564640," sense because it's architecture not really the data it's just the basic architecture and i'm pretty sure"
4564640,4571040," this format is going to evolve over time because this assumes fully connected neural networks right"
4571040,4575840," so but there are different kinds of neural networks what if uh our library is going to support like"
4575840,4580960," convolutional neural networks and convolutional neural networks uh are described differently"
4580960,4587520," furthermore uh there are sort of like a come like hybrid neural networks is is that even a term"
4587520,4593440," that ai people use but as far as i know quite often people at least used to do i'm not sure how common"
4593440,4600560," it is today but they used to like have several convolutional layers as the first uh layers that uh"
4600560,4605600," sort of perceive the image because it's usually for images and then at the back end they have fully"
4605600,4610480," connected neural networks that sort of has the logic on the convolutional neural networks so the"
4610480,4616720," convolutional layers sort of compress uh different things and filter out uh and then you have the"
4616720,4622080," decision making with a fully connected you mean high dimensional i i don't know i'm not an ai person i"
4622080,4627200," don't know the terminology so how do you call the neural networks that combine convolutional neural"
4627200,4632800," networks and fully connected neural networks is there any term sort of like a hybrid ones"
4632800,4638640," heterogeneous because you can come up with a lot of pompous terms to sound cool to your investors so i don't"
4638640,4644400," know which of the pompous terms the ai people chose to call this kind of stuff like because i'm not in"
4644400,4650880," the industry like i don't know like your conventions so i can't remember a term for them"
4650880,4655520," like me neither i don't know like which term actually gives you more money from the investors"
4655520,4661280," like which one like sounds cooler like i don't really know uh it looks like hybrid is actually used"
4661280,4667360," in some papers nice okay so i guessed the pompous term correctly that's cool so that means i can"
4667360,4673840," already work in the ai industry because that's what's important uh because otherwise how can you get"
4673840,4679760," the money out of the investors if you can't get money out of the investors by constantly using this"
4679760,4686880," pompous five head terms you won't be able to even do anything right because you can't do research if"
4686880,4693760," you can't eat right so that's why the terms the cool terms are way more important than what you do"
4693760,4700560," because that's what gets you money i'm joking i'm just joking don't get me serious okay"
4700560,4709280," but i know how it works i know how it works i worked in other industries anyway so um"
4712800,4719360," spoken phone spoken phone right so let's actually write this entire stuff"
4719360,4726800," buffer so this is the buffer len and then we're gonna have like one"
4726800,4735920," so and i just want to see if it actually like reads the entire file i just want to see if it actually"
4735920,4742400," read anything so let's command this stuff out and uh let's do the gym let's show it who's the boss of the"
4742400,4751360," gym failed to open file because it's not adder.nn it's actually kind of cool that um this entire thing"
4751360,4760880," automatically logs everything for you yo this is so cool um you're joking but similar uh happened at my work"
4760880,4767440," recently we had to describe a multi-threaded job system in the fancy way to impress stupid people"
4767440,4771760," yeah i know like i'm joking but i'm actually have joking right"
4771760,4782160," so because because i've seen how that happens like i've seen how that happens i know how that works"
4783120,4792240," and because of that if i met meet people from other sort of areas of like work and like it and stuff"
4792240,4798560," like that and they start throwing all of these fancy pompous term i know what they're trying to do"
4798560,4804400," like like i i know because i know how that works like you're not gonna fool me with all of that stuff"
4804960,4814720," right uh because you can always describe the same thing with simpler easy to understand terms you can"
4814720,4820560," do that you just choose not to do that for certain purposes for gatekeeping purposes for impressing"
4820560,4832560," purposes like i know how it works yeah uh anyways so um okay um arch"
4832560,4844400," cool we managed to read that shite how about it how about it so the next thing we probably need to do we"
4844400,4852320," need to parse this entire thing uh and uh maybe i'm gonna just use like something like as sv.h right"
4852320,4858240," so this is the yeah is it is it just a sv i think it's just a sv right it's it's another single"
4858240,4864640," header uh single header library right so you can find it in here and this is just like a string views"
4864640,4870080," people keep uh sending me pull requests but i don't have time and resources to actually look into them"
4870080,4875600," so i really apologize for for anyone who sends the pull request and i don't really look into them"
4875600,4881600," uh right so let me just download this entire thing it's actually very convenient for parsing in general"
4881600,4890320," in c specifically uh and then use it for that finally wait a second did they just edit the download button"
4890320,4898640," what the i mean wait a second so like this website"
4900080,4909680," it exists since 2009 since 2009 it's over 10 years holy shit it's almost 15 years"
4909680,4918480," and it took them more than 10 years to come up with this revolutionary feature to download a raw file"
4918480,4928320," holy shit it took uh resources of multi-billion corporations because before they got bought by microsoft"
4928320,4935600," they couldn't do that it was impossible computer science problem and then microsoft bought them and"
4935600,4941040," they used that their multi-billion corporation resources and they finally came up with this"
4941040,4949760," beautiful solution holy fucking shit oh my god finally that's the actual advancement not all of that ai hype"
4950560,4957440," this is the actual advancement and software development holy shit look at that yo what a"
4957440,4965520," anyways so but really why was it so fucking difficult to just add this button i don't know"
4966240,4980160," um so anyway so sv.h uh i'm gonna move this thing in here and there we go uh okay jim.c uh we need to"
4980160,4989840," include uh sv.h and what we have in sv.h we have to also do sv implementation uh let me go define so what"
4989840,4995920," we can what we what we can do we can now construct uh string view out of the parts right so we can say"
4995920,5002320," that uh we're gonna have a string view content right so this is a string view content and the data is the"
5002320,5008480," buffer uh and this thing is the buffer len and we may have some problems in here right because the"
5008480,5014480," um string view sort of expects just appointed to the character but we have appointed to unsigned characters"
5015280,5020160," uh right and uh we'll see so let's actually take a look at the compilation errors and what they're"
5020160,5026480," complaining about uh what are they complaining about there's a couple of warnings but i think"
5026480,5032560," we can quite easily just say shut the up and just like suck it up and that should be"
5032560,5040320," fine okay so we have content so now while content uh is greater than zero right while it is greater than"
5040320,5048080," zero one of the things we can do we can do sv chop by delimiter right we chop by delimiter we provide"
5048080,5056240," the content and the delimiter is going to be actually space right we're chopping by the space uh and uh here"
5056240,5062080," we get like a single layer in here right so we essentially get a single layer and one of the things"
5062080,5072240," we can do now we can say uh print this entire thing uh sv arg right so nsv fmt sv arc is a classical thing"
5072240,5080560," that i use right so uh essentially it just allows you to use printf with a structure because string view"
5080560,5085040," is a structure but sometimes you want to use printf with this entire thing and they come up with a bunch"
5085040,5089840," of macros that makes it a little bit easier for you right for the formatting you have to use this thing"
5089840,5096480," nsv arc basically just destructure destructurizes the structure into several arguments right so then"
5096480,5104080," you can essentially print it like this right so it's kind of cool all right so and now i might as"
5104080,5113600," well actually rub this entire stuff in this right so we can rub this entire stuff in this and uh let's go"
5113600,5118640," let's go and as you can see it kind of worked but the problem here is that it printed this entire thing"
5118640,5125520," and we separated this entire stuff into numbers we can now uh parse these numbers as far as i know"
5125520,5132800," there was yeah so you can literally try to do something like this we can also try to use this thing"
5132800,5139680," chop u64 right which literally tries to chop a number out of this entire stuff i think that's"
5139680,5145200," that's even better than just separating it by spaces right because what if you have several spaces"
5145200,5150240," right if you have several spaces you're gonna have a little bit of a trouble uh right so let me take a"
5150240,5156480," look so if you have like several of these things you have a little bit of a trouble uh right so as you can"
5156480,5166800," see yeah so it's kind of dumb i'm not gonna lie so what would be better in my opinion opinion is to use this thing"
5166800,5175600," we just chop this stuff out of the content right so uh does it trim the white spaces in front of this thing"
5175600,5180960," okay it doesn't trim them but we can do that ourselves right so essentially this is an old way of doing that"
5180960,5189040," we don't care about it we can do a swim sv trim a left uh we just trim all of this stuff in the content"
5189040,5200320," uh right and then uh we chop the number right so here is the number uh and uh then we basically just"
5200320,5206160," print this entire thing right so now we should be able to do something like so this is uint64 let's"
5206160,5212720," cast this something to integer right so just to make it a little bit easier because like uint64 has"
5212720,5218080," a special way of printing that with printf so it's a little bit pain in the ass so let's actually do it"
5218080,5223840," like that uh there we go and as you can see regardless of the amount of spaces it just works like that"
5223840,5233360," though if you have um for instance no things at all right and just a bunch of spaces it's still going to"
5233360,5241680," be rather weird right because it says that you have at least one number in here which is like not true"
5241680,5246560," right so essentially what we want to do we want to have like a slightly different way of doing that so"
5246560,5254160," first thing we do is trim and only then check if it's empty or not only then check if it's empty or"
5254160,5260720," not and then trim again at the end of the iteration so first we trim and then if that makes the content"
5260720,5267040," count equal zero that means we stop the iteration but if it's not we try to chop the character out of"
5267040,5275360," that and then we continue and so on and so forth so there could be some problems if uh this entire thing"
5275360,5281520," starts with for example a character right because if i remember correctly uh this entire thing just"
5281520,5289360," handles up until the digits right so this thing may basically hang if you have anything that is not"
5289360,5296480," a digit in here right so that means uh that one of the things we probably want to do is content count"
5296480,5307840," is greater than zero and and uh content data zero is digit only then do that so that that will make"
5307840,5314160," the entire loop stop as soon as it sees uh a single character right okay and that's way better way of"
5314160,5320640," doing that in my opinion right so here as you can see there's no numbers there's no numbers uh we can now"
5320640,5330000," put um uh eight in here right so we're gonna put eight in here uh right so as you can see there's one"
5330000,5336720," eight we can even put some stuff here on a separate line so as you can see it still works and then if"
5336720,5342400," we put accidentally like a character in here it will just stop at the character right so maybe one of the"
5342400,5347360," things we can do is just like make a warning there uh and stuff like that but i'm not going to do that"
5347360,5352400," so here we're going to have five uh and as you can see this is a very robust way of doing this entire"
5352400,5358720," stuff this is a very robust way of doing that and maybe it will evolve into something uh interesting in"
5358720,5368560," the future right uh isn't that poggers i think that's pretty freaking poggers so um cool so but"
5368560,5375920," that means we have to now add these numbers to uh some sort of array right we need to add those numbers"
5375920,5381520," to some sort of array so what we're going to be adding that to we need to have dynamic arrays right"
5381520,5388560," so and you know how i implement dynamic arrays so i usually have a macro i can steal that macro from"
5388640,5395440," dead yet again so it's going to be src so i think it's located somewhere in the common da append right"
5395440,5402880," so that's a very simple macro uh it's a very simple macro that we can just put in here so and essentially"
5402880,5409840," what this macro expects is some sort of um um like it uh so sort of a structure that looks like this"
5409840,5417680," right and then here we have to do uh items i think so this is how we do that so it calls them item yeah so"
5417680,5425520," this is the items it should also have the count and the capacity uh right so and essentially what"
5425520,5430960," we can do we can say okay so here's the architecture it's initially zero initialized and then as soon as"
5430960,5437120," we read something so let's actually convert this stuff to size t we're going to do da append arch"
5438800,5448160," x right there we go and now we have the uh the architecture with which we can now construct a neural"
5448160,5459360," network right so that means we can just like do it like this arch data arch count count and that should"
5459360,5465120," create the neural network for us we can even randomize this entire thing and then we're going to actually"
5465120,5471760," print this entire thing like so there we go so let me try to run this entire thing and there's a couple"
5471760,5479200," of warnings so do i append oh yeah so it wants to have the initial capacity uh so let's set the initial"
5479200,5488960," capacity to something like uh 256 i don't know i think that's more or less reasonable more or less uh"
5488960,5496240," implicit declaration of assert okay let's include assert here as well so here is the assert uh what else do we"
5496240,5506160," need to have in here uh implicit declaration of an end so we have to include uh and then dot h and"
5506160,5515280," and implementation uh there we go so is it working so it's actually items uh so what else do we have"
5515280,5525920," so when we randomize and we have to specify the range right so basically lower and upper count"
5525920,5536080," upper value and it kind of worked but it took a little bit some time yeah okay so yeah it's actually"
5536080,5541760," pretty cool and it also logs right uh file loaded correctly but yeah this is basically the neural"
5541760,5548400," network that we managed to create in here and uh so that means here i can have like other neural networks"
5548400,5555600," right so uh for instance zor1 so zor1 is basically 2 uh 2 1 right"
5555600,5560880," right and if i try to restart the center i think uh i wonder why it takes so much time but yeah"
5560880,5566560," so as you can see we can specify the architecture of the neural network at the runtime now"
5566560,5573680," is it in progress isn't focus i think it's pretty freaking powers uh right so and for editor let's"
5573680,5579680," actually get back to here and we can have several like different files for this entire stuff right so i"
5579680,5588080," think i think i think that's pretty cool i think that's pretty cool all right so uh we managed to read"
5588080,5595440," this entire stuff so the next thing we need to do we need to initialize the window and stuff like that"
5595440,5597280," right right so let's initialize the window"
5597280,5604080," all right okay"
5604080,5610720," so adder dot c"
5610720,5619680," so we're probably also going to do something like this so the other thing we need to do we need to be able to"
5619680,5628160," read the um the data right but to read the data we need to generate the data as well"
5628160,5634640," so the question is how exactly are we going to be doing all of that how exactly we're going to be doing"
5634640,5643520," all of that so the input and output data is basically the uh the matrices right so where the rows"
5643520,5655440," is the amount of samples and the columns are the things okay the columns could be quite easily derived"
5655440,5664160," from the architecture of the neural network right so here so we have at least eight columns for the input"
5664640,5670800," and then five more columns for the output right so that's what we have in here so that's what we"
5670800,5678720," have uh the question is how do we specify the rows we can come up with some sort of a like um"
5678720,5688400," binary format we can come up with the binary format where for instance first eight bytes right so you"
5688400,5695520," have first eight bytes and this is basically the amount of rows in your neural network right maybe"
5695520,5703920," maybe we can specify columns as well right so who said we can't really do that so it's gonna be eight bytes"
5703920,5711600," and then you have basically sequences of eight bytes right sequences of eight bytes like so"
5712400,5721840," uh where each byte is the element of the matrix of this specific matrix okay so this could be like a"
5721840,5728480," general format for uh serializing the matrices right so if you have a matrix you can just serialize it"
5728480,5734400," into this binary format and just like dump it and then load up if you want to right it would be kind of also"
5734400,5741600," nice to have a magic in here right some sort of a magic uh usually like how big of a magic people put"
5741600,5745520," in their binary files i suppose like eight bytes right"
5745520,5756160," so this is basically the binary format i'm thinking about right so the question is what's going to be the"
5756160,5770000," the magic um uh the magic um uh the magic could be something like i don't know nn dot h this is literally four bytes actually"
5770000,5776080," and and h"
5776080,5785920," so because what if i want to actually also serialize neural networks entire neural networks"
5785920,5796400," right so that means i may have separate um separate magics for that right separate magics for that"
5796400,5808160," so it would be kind of cool to have like n n um m so this is for matrix and for the neural network"
5808160,5814640," i don't know it's kind of difficult to come up so matrix"
5815920,5822960," um man this is kind of hard like how can you even come up with this kind of thing"
5822960,5834480," and then h dot mat but that's a lot of bytes right that's uh eight characters which is probably fine"
5834480,5842400," yeah thank you right so it's basically in that case it's going to be eight bytes i mean this is a 2023 why"
5842400,5851040," why i do why even worry about uh you know this kind of stuff right so we can have a mat and then we can"
5851040,5860400," have like an n right so that makes sense i think i think that makes sense all right so uh let's go ahead"
5860400,5868080," and maybe implement some functions that will enable us doing this kind of stuff right so if you take a look at an n dot h uh"
5868080,5875040," right so we have mat a log you can allocate you can randomize um you can print this entire thing"
5875040,5885360," and uh let's actually do something like mat save maybe right mat save and essentially here"
5885360,5891840," uh we're gonna accept the the file right so the output and the matrix right so and it will just like"
5891840,5897600," literally save and another thing we probably want to have is load uh right so this is going to be in"
5897600,5903520," so this is the two functions that we'll need to implement like save and load uh some of them may fail"
5903520,5907520," i don't really know what we have to do in case of a failure but we can just crash at least for now"
5908640,5920880," uh right so let's go mat a log uh let's for now implement only save all right so this is going to be that"
5920880,5934320," um okay um so let's do right right so we're going to have something like magic and the magic is going to be"
5934320,5941760," an n dot h mat right so there is like uh eight characters in here right so and we're going to just"
5941760,5952960," do f right uh output magic and then str len of the magic that's western of the magic and one i think"
5952960,5959680," out has to be actually at here right in the case of an errors what do we do in case of an errors"
5960320,5966800," um so we can do use the raylib approach essentially if an error has happened"
5966800,5976080," we just log it and exit right we can say something like f-printfstd error uh nn.h um could not"
5976080,5985440," could not write to file right so could not write to file but maybe i don't know how useful that is"
5985440,5989680," for now at least right because we're going to be opening the file outside of this entire thing and if you"
5989680,5995920," manage to open the file it's usually fine so there's no need to do this kind of stuff so maybe whatever"
5995920,6006960," uh okay so um let's do f right and let's actually write the following thing so the first thing is going"
6006960,6016560," to be rows right uh size of um rows one and output and also let's put the columns in here so this is the"
6016560,6023600," columns all right so and then uh one of the things we want to do we want to do f right uh so this is the"
6023600,6031600," elements size of a single element and the amount of elements we have in here is m rows and m columns"
6031600,6038480," right so m rows and m columns uh multiplied to each other right by each other and that's basically the whole"
6038480,6048720," serialization uh that's basically the whole serialization so so this entire thing may actually"
6048720,6056160," not uh provide like like save everything so i suppose you have to run it in a loop uh right but one of the"
6056160,6064720," the things we can do we can kind of run it in a loop right essentially look while n is sort of like a less"
6064720,6073840," than this entire thing right well it's less than this entire thing we may want to uh do the following stuff"
6074880,6091920," right plus n plus n plus n minus n right and then we are ready to another m and then let's go and also"
6091920,6102480," maybe while not f error uh out right because if it errors it may keep returning zero and we can actually"
6102480,6109840," hang in there uh right is that a good thing i think that's a pretty good thing uh right another assertion"
6109840,6116000," that we may put in here is basically that m is always less or equal than the current n"
6116000,6119920," just in case because you never know what's going to happen otherwise it's just gonna"
6119920,6121360," actually here"
6121360,6128080," yeah no i'm doing something stupid in here as it is"
6128080,6135040," yeah that's fine that's that's totally fine that's actually like perfect right okay so"
6136160,6143840," isn't it cool i think that's pretty freaking cool so let's go ahead and try to write a generator for"
6143840,6144640," some data"
6144640,6152880," unintentionally completely unintentional uh right so this is going to be a separate program so i suppose"
6152880,6161040," the the idea is going to be the following okay so you need to somehow come up with that data"
6161040,6165760," somehow the question is how are you going to come up with that that's a very good question"
6165760,6172480," i suppose they're going to be like another like a gen right generator"
6172480,6181840," that creates you the data right which you then fit into the gym then gym uh spits out the uh the"
6181840,6188160," neural network that that you can use in your application is that too complicated of a of a thing"
6188160,6193680," what about the stride that's a good question yes i should probably take a stride into account"
6194320,6196720," yeah thank you thank you so much um"
6196720,6203440," so is that too complicated over like a workflow with the center i think i don't know it kind of"
6203440,6210560," feels a little bit complicated but i don't know how else what else would you do right so if you want"
6210560,6214880," to have this visualization tool that just shows you the process of learning i think that's what you have"
6214880,6222080," to do um you have the number of rows and columns no need for stride what are you talking about is that the"
6222080,6226800," words of the person who have no idea how this library works"
6229360,6234800," we do have stride so and what if somebody will try to save the"
6234800,6243040," the entire thing right we do have a stride and we need to take it into account because that's how the"
6243040,6250080," library works and i know how the library works because i wrote it and the viewer in the chat knows how the"
6250080,6257440," library works because they watched the stream okay so uh i suppose what we need to do in here so"
6257440,6261040," yeah so let's do this kind of stuff"
6263440,6267760," so let's iterate by rows right so this is going to be a room plus plus i"
6267760,6275280," so we're going to put it like this and the question is where do we start i suppose we can"
6275280,6282080," do one of the things we can do mat at and we can just do m and then we start at the row i"
6282080,6288640," at the column zero and that resolves the stuff with them with the stride automatically right so we're"
6288640,6294480," gonna do it like this and here in fact now we're just trying to save columns right so we're just"
6294480,6300400," saving the columns uh and that means that here instead of this kind of stuff we can just do it"
6300400,6303360," like that there we go isn't that poggers"
6303360,6315520," isn't it poggers i think that's pretty freaking poggers so um yeah let's come up with the generator"
6317760,6324640," but don't you need to also save the stride field it gets lost after serialization it gets lost after"
6324640,6339200," serialization so no um so all right uh adder again dot h it will be kind of interesting to actually"
6339200,6347680," store the architecture here as well if you know what i mean because the actual training data is tied"
6347680,6359200," to be to the to the architecture right if you change uh if you change the architecture you have to change"
6359200,6362720," the training data and if you change the training data you have to change the architecture so"
6362720,6370080," it's kind of a it's kind of an interesting thing isn't it it's kind of an interesting thing so maybe"
6371040,6379360," we should actually save uh the whole thing in here like the whole though no it's not necessary because"
6379360,6386080," it's only about inputs and outputs yeah it's only about inputs and outputs so it should be"
6386080,6395040," probably a different thing okay so adder gen uh let's create the scene right so let's do the following"
6395040,6402560," thing and then the h define uh and then implementation right so this is going to be a separate program that"
6402560,6412160," just generates the stuff uh and we can actually take the adder dot c and take the bits all right so i'm"
6412160,6420400," going to take the bits and how do we even generate this entire stuff so this is how we generate the data"
6421360,6423440," yeah that's the whole thing actually ability mode"
6423440,6435600," and what's funny is that we are doing separate matrices in here we're doing separate matrices which"
6435600,6443760," actually raises the question maybe what we have to do instead we have to sort of like put it into a"
6443760,6452000," single matrix right put it into yeah okay so we can just allocate a single matrix which is going to be"
6452000,6458000," like a combination of these two and then we can take like a sub views of these matrices"
6458000,6463040," this plus one right so this one is essentially going to be"
6465200,6477520," like this like this so es we start at uh essentially met at t zero zero right so that's what we start at"
6477520,6483440," the amount of rows is the same as the amount of rows of the original one the amount of columns though"
6484080,6495680," is two multiplied by bits but the stride uh the stride stays the same as from the original uh thing so this"
6495680,6503200," is the sub matrix in here so for the outputs for the outputs we do the following thing i mean what the"
6503200,6515040," hell is this actually so yes um in terms of the row it's still zero in terms of the column though uh it's"
6515040,6522000," going to be offset by this thing right it's going to be offset the amount of rows is the same the amount"
6522000,6529680," of rows the same the amount of columns is different it's bits plus one and the stride is also the same"
6529680,6536480," because that's kind of the point that's kind of the point of the stride so and that means i don't have"
6536480,6542800," to modify any of the code below right so this this is done so i don't have to modify anything in here"
6542800,6549600," because i'm afraid to make a mistake right so they now are viewed uh like this is a single matrix but"
6549600,6556480," we take sub matrices like single views uh and then we can quite easily just say okay save this entire stuff"
6556480,6563360," so we have to like say output uh t right we're saving not ti or or to we're saving like the entire team"
6563360,6573040," right so but to save this entire thing we have to like open the stuff f open uh adder uh right so"
6573040,6580640," so what should i call it the adder mat right so i think it makes sense to call it adder mat and i'm"
6580640,6590240," going to close this and i think and if out is equal to no we can say something like uh fprintf uh error"
6590240,6602160," could not open file this uh right and i have to provide the std error exit one maybe just return one"
6602800,6613120," here to zero okay and uh i suppose we need to have a file path maybe out file path uh const char"
6613120,6623280," this thing and then put it in here uh out file path path path and then after that we can say print f"
6624720,6633360," generated s out file path there we go so we have a program that generates some data so it's added to the"
6633360,6643440," build script so we're gonna have adder gen and let's see if it's going to even compile so um"
6646080,6653920," i call it the get not god damn it my god okay so let's recompile okay so let's go through the"
6653920,6662080," compilation errors so it doesn't have a string uh let's add the string dot h in here so what else do we"
6662080,6675600," want um so m is not structure or union member reference has a base size size t what are you talking about"
6675600,6681360," right so yes if i'm not mistaken right so if you take a look at the matrix it's a pointer"
6681360,6688160," and then i just do that so that should result in a pointer um"
6688160,6704480," what am i being dumb reference base type size t so maybe i don't understand how f right works right here you're"
6704480,6714240," supposed to have a pointer right so here's the pointer uh by doing m dot es plus n i get the pointer because"
6714240,6722080," this is a pointer this is size t so if you add a size t to pointer you get a pointer um"
6724480,6735120," oh i see because all right why it wasn't complaining about yeah it's this is because it was shadowing it's"
6735120,6742240," good get them shadowing all right i see i see i see i see i see shadowing yeah"
6742240,6752000," shadowed fact me yet again okay so we are trying to actually write binary and that should work implicit"
6752000,6757520," declaration of an end save uh really that's actually really weird um"
6757520,6766240," where you excuse me"
6770160,6775120," it's not an end save yeah uh it's a mad save yeah it's a mad save"
6775120,6789680," so yeah all right that's cool and now one of the things i want to do i want to do error gen and it"
6789680,6799440," it's a generated error matrix right uh what is shadowing um it's when you define a variable two"
6799440,6807440," different variables with the same name right essentially you have a variable in one scope"
6808080,6809280," and you have another variable"
6809280,6816160," of the with the same name but with the different type in a different scope"
6816160,6828480," uh yeah maybe i can do something like integer because not everyone familiar with size t"
6828480,6836640," right so what's going to happen in this particular specific case which x is going to be picked in this"
6836640,6846880," this particular case it's going to be x so x float x shadowed the integer x so that's what's shadowing"
6846880,6852560," is referring to usually some languages allow that some languages disallow that depending on the like"
6852560,6860160," style and community and culture and religion uh shadowing may be a good thing or it may be a bad thing"
6860160,6869760," right so it's kind of like a polarizing topic if that makes sense okay so we created the matrix right so uh"
6869760,6877520," and this is how it looks like so it kind of like probably ruins the encoding so yeah here is the magic"
6877520,6885120," and then we have the rest of the stuff so we can take a look at in hex mode uh right and yeah so we have"
6885120,6893680," some data in here we do have some data in here so let's actually close this into i think and uh now we"
6893680,6905360," should implement a thing that loads up the the matrix from here right so essentially we need to implement"
6905360,6921360," uh a symmetrical function to uh a symmetrical function to an n save and it's going to be an n load so uh since we know that the magic is uh essentially eight bytes i can actually save this entire magic in here right so we're loading so loading is probably going to um allocate some memory so maybe we just have to do it like that right so mat load"
6921360,6935520," right so we're gonna return the matrix"
6935520,6946800," this is a mat load there we go uh all right so we're gonna f read magic size of magic"
6947520,6951840," one and this is going to be in right so we just read the magic and we have to confirm"
6951840,6955200," that uh magic is equal to"
6955200,6962080," that thing somehow uh right so we can take a look at how it is represented within"
6962080,6966160," uh the entire thing so i need to open the"
6966160,6968080," adder mat"
6969040,6971680," so i can take a look at the hexel i suppose"
6971680,6974320," so"
6974320,6979360," uh what is it and then h and uh xxd"
6979360,6981440," what is it called adder"
6981440,6983360," dot mat"
6983360,6985600," right and let's actually do the head"
6985600,6988080," right so this is basically how it looks like"
6988080,6990480," and what we can do"
6990480,6992000," i think"
6992000,6995120," i do believe so is copy this here"
6995920,6997760," and just say okay"
6997760,7001760," we expect this magic to be equal to that"
7001760,7007200," i think that's how it's going to work hopefully but maybe uh because of the um"
7007200,7010000," yeah because of the"
7010000,7015680," little endian and some other it could be actually written in a reversed order"
7017040,7020960," right so it's probably gonna yeah it's probably gonna fail"
7020960,7027040," so that means we'll have to uh you know reverse the the bytes or something like that"
7027040,7034640," though quite often people use this kind of stuff to determine uh what uh platform they're in whether"
7034640,7039040," it's a little indian platform or big indian platform and stuff like that so"
7039040,7044160," uh in any case i'm gonna just keep it like that and if it fails we can fix that doesn't really matter"
7044160,7049600," so uh the next thing we need to do we need to have rows and columns right so we need to have rows and columns"
7051200,7065440," and one of the things we want to do we want to allocate the matrix with this rows and columns"
7065440,7071120," once we allocated that we just want to keep reading this entire stuff right so we're going to have"
7072000,7085600," size tn f read so es uh size of s and what we want to read we want to read uh rows and columns right so"
7085600,7087040," this is the new rows and columns"
7087040,7098800," and while n is less than rows and columns and there is no error while reading all that"
7101440,7109760," we want to repeat this entire stuff but actually plus n uh minus n right so let me double check"
7109760,7116560," mat save uh plus and minus n okay so just double check that everything is correct"
7116560,7123360," and uh n plus k there we go so that should read this entire thing"
7129120,7136240," so okay so the thing we want to do in here right the thing we want to do in here now is uh go to the"
7136240,7142960," gym right and read uh the whole thing right i want to read the whole thing"
7142960,7151200," interestingly so in case of"
7153360,7163920," uh huh you know what that is very interesting when we're reading this entire thing we don't really"
7163920,7171360," need to use and unload we could have just like loaded the whole matrix into the memory and then just use"
7171360,7179920," that right so then we can could construct the matrix structure and just point its es at the correct place"
7179920,7186800," and set rows and columns that's one of the things we could have done right so who said we can't do that"
7186800,7195840," i think we can um so yeah that's actually that's actually probably even better if you know what i mean"
7196960,7209040," um right but uh i probably want to do that a little bit later so uh i think i want to make a small break"
7209040,7216480," because i'm already streaming for two hours right so i would like to make another cup of tea uh right and"
7216480,7223840," after the cup of tea we're going to continue doing this entire stuff um okay let's continue so uh let's go ahead and"
7223840,7231520," maybe open some stuff in here so honestly i would like to actually accept the arguments through the"
7231520,7239360," command line right so that would kind of make sense uh right so if rxc so usually the way i do that i"
7239360,7245760," use the shift pattern right so can i copy paste the shift from somewhere do i have shift in here no i don't"
7246720,7254720," so the idea is essentially that i have shift um function in here which accepts the pointer to arc c"
7254720,7262000," and uh triple pointer to arc v how about that it's not progress i think it's pretty progress"
7263360,7270400," so um so um so usually called it arc shift right so this is arc shift one of the things we want to do"
7270400,7279600," we want to ascertain here that arc c uh is greater than zero right so then we can do uh essentially arc c"
7279600,7290160," minus uh and one of the things we have to do we have to come up with the results right so and the result is"
7290160,7297760," essentially arc v uh right but it has to be like a yeah we need to do the double dereferencing to"
7297760,7304320," actually get to the to the thing and uh maybe here i'm going to do something like this and in here i just"
7304320,7310560," dereference this specific thing i need a plus one and get to the next sort of point and this and this is"
7310560,7317920," going to be the result so here i'm going to have a program right so this is the program uh args"
7317920,7324320," did i call it arc shift or just should okay so we called it arc shift in this piece of case so provide"
7324320,7335680," it like that and uh there we go so after that i can check um if arc c is greater than zero right if it's"
7335680,7340480," actually lesser than zero that means uh not enough arguments were provided and we can actually"
7340480,7350480," complain about that uh std error right so error no architecture file was provided so first one is"
7350480,7358240," going to be architecture file um all right and we're going to return one so after that we're going to do"
7358240,7366960," arch file path and this is going to be just arcs shift uh arc scene argue so we're sort of like a"
7366960,7377920," popping out the the stuff right and if after that arc c is less again that means no data file was provided"
7377920,7389840," right so no data uh data file was provided so and here we just do um actually yeah let's call it data"
7389840,7398080," so this is a data file path so and here instead of this thing we're just using uh arch file path"
7398080,7406160," and i suppose in case of an error this entire thing would return boolean uh no i mean sorry and uh"
7407360,7413280," in that case like the function already logs that it couldn't load the file so we don't really have"
7413280,7419440," to do anything we can just like you know put one in here and then worry about anything so then we're"
7419440,7425680," parsing architecture so everything seems to be fine and the next thing we need to do i suppose"
7425680,7432480," let me actually comment out this entire part for now uh we want to load the matrix right so we want to do"
7432480,7441920," load um not a matrix but we have to provide the in right so we have to provide the in uh and that would"
7441920,7452960," give us the the training matrix so in is essentially f open and is going to data file path uh a reading"
7452960,7458240," binary if in is equal to null you can say that we couldn't read the file"
7460880,7471120," all right error um could not read file um this data file path like so and we're going to just return"
7471120,7477040," with one uh after that we're going to close this entire thing and one of the things i want to do i"
7477040,7484160," want to just print the matrix that we managed to read from the file hopefully we'll see we'll see"
7484160,7490880," so one of the things we probably also want to do i want to print the usage right uh just to tell the"
7490880,7495360," user how you're supposed to use this entire thing right so it's going to be the usage this is the"
7495360,7507840," program right then you have to provide the um you know model uh arc and then model mat right which is the"
7507840,7522240," metrics uh right and we're going to say twice in here uh so now uh let's try to is this a gym"
7522240,7529920," yeah it is a gym so it is correct thing so let's try to build into i think uh so yeah we have to do source"
7530560,7539920," uh opt uh array lib environment and then go so what is it complaining about it complains about magic"
7539920,7545520," um expected semi what the is this error"
7549520,7555600," are you freaking serious like is that because you in 64 is undefined"
7555600,7562880," what the is like i mean okay if the reason then"
7562880,7571760," like okay i can i can just try this is the most unreasonable error message i've ever"
7571760,7576080," seen in my entire life is that the reason that was reason"
7577840,7584240," it had nothing to do with semicolons holy can you restructure your parsing so you don't"
7584240,7590320," have to say such thing like what maybe maybe this is a problem with c like"
7590320,7596000," it's just like what this is so bad like it's not helpful"
7596000,7602480," when your error message is unhelpful it's a bug this is straight up unhelpful"
7605040,7609040," well i mean at least it wasn't that bad that they couldn't figure out what exactly happening but it's"
7609040,7612400," bad like these kind of error messages are bad"
7612400,7617920," straight up because like semi cool like what the are you even talking about it has nothing to do with"
7617920,7624240," that at least reorder your errors or just do something oh my god i don't know why"
7624880,7634480," things like that piss me off but it's just like i don't know"
7634480,7641760," i swear to god anyways i'm sorry uh jim no architecture file was provided okay so let's"
7641760,7647440," provide the architecture for the editor uh all right no data file do we have an editor mat"
7648160,7655520," there we go so and the magic is not equal to that because it has to be i suppose reversed right so"
7655520,7661520," let me try to do the following thing i wonder if there is like an easy way to reverse this thing"
7661520,7670880," like not manually um so can i do reverse uh region no i didn't really do that one of the things i can"
7670880,7684400," do i can probably split this into new lines all right and then just reverse and then concatenate everything"
7684400,7699120," back can your vim do that can your vim do that it cannot do it can i'm sorry uh an insert and there"
7699120,7701360," we go so i suppose that's what it has to be"
7705040,7710320," um let me let me see"
7710320,7725680," i don't know what the compiler is supposed to do in that case if the identifier is declared the"
7725680,7734240," terminating if the what is supposed to say it's supposed to say identifier is not uh declared that's"
7734240,7744160," it why it feels like it resolves the type devs at parsing time that's what it feels like"
7744160,7752720," and why do you resolve the aliases type devs at the parsing time is that because the language forces"
7752720,7756400," you that means the language is which actually confers my hypothesis that c is"
7756400,7762800," so yeah why are we still using this language in 2023 why are we still forced to use this language in 2023"
7763440,7774720," why there is no good alternatives to c no rust and zig are not alternative to c um anyway"
7774720,7778720," so"
7785440,7794320," okay so uh let's try to okay why did it remove this kind of thing"
7807360,7816320," okay here's the matrix here's the training data chat this is the training data we recovered from a file"
7816320,7824000," isn't that poogers my dudes isn't that poogers i think it's free pretty freaking poogers"
7824800,7832160," so this is basically uh what we had to do right the andianess fucked me in the ass yet again"
7832160,7844320," the andians okay but here is the thing about t uh so we still need to split it into ti and to"
7844320,7854320," right so we still have to do that uh so let's construct this thing like so it's kind of similar right so"
7855360,7859680," in terms of the rows it's going to be the same amount of rows as the original thing in terms"
7859680,7867440," of the columns actually it's going to be rather interesting so essentially we're going to have"
7867440,7873440," an assertion we're going to have an assertion that amount of columns of this thing amount of columns of"
7873440,7883280," this thing is actually equal to the architecture data zero plus architecture data uh last one"
7883280,7895920," right so yeah because the first n columns is the inputs and the second and like m columns is the"
7895920,7903760," outputs and n is equal to the amount of inputs and the amount of outputs right so which kind of implies"
7903760,7915120," that we also expect n count to be at least greater than zero so and in that case maybe it has to be even"
7915120,7920080," greater than one because you need to have inputs and outputs so but i'm not handy percent sure about that"
7920080,7933520," specific case so that actually boils down to um can we have um and then with just input"
7935120,7940240," because i'm not quite sure like what's the implication of this stuff what's the implication of this stuff"
7940240,7944000," so yeah anyways um"
7944000,7956880," so here uh it'll be nice to have like a separate stuff right inputs we can call it uh ins size right so it's"
7956880,7968080," going to be size t ins size uh and this is going to be outs size which is arch count minus one"
7968080,7979120," outs size so in terms of columns uh columns is going to be ins size stride is going to be the same as"
7980400,7990480," the stride original stride and es is basically matrix at zero zero uh t that's just a point here"
7990480,7999920," so the outputs uh all right so the rows is the same the rows is the amount of samples the columns is out"
7999920,8012160," as z stride is the same uh stride is the same then we can do mat at t and uh so this is the offset the"
8012160,8019520," offset is ins size there we go so and let's actually see if we manage to separate these things correctly"
8019520,8028160," so i'm going to print to i and print to o uh right so let's see so did we manage to separate this correctly"
8028160,8034480," it doesn't work uh is it because it's items yeah it's called items i see"
8034480,8043760," all right so semicolon excuse me what else um"
8056560,8059440," okay so it seems to be yeah so this is correct separation"
8059440,8065680," all right this is actually pretty cool uh all right so that means we have everything so"
8065680,8072720," we literally have everything and we're ready to go"
8072720,8082160," so let's start the window right let's start the window"
8083520,8089040," and uh let's continue copying this stuff from here and let's see"
8089040,8099200," uh all right so we just do the back propagation right but that requires an n and g right so let's"
8099200,8105600," actually construct those things right so uh we're going to be constructing those things like so"
8108560,8114160," so we also have a learning rate which is usually one i think one is kind of dangerous thing to have"
8114160,8120160," but that's totally fine that is totally fine all right"
8124320,8130400," and i guess that's it right so let's try to compile this entire thing i'm not gonna run"
8130400,8138080," the gym for now right because it will start the ui and stuff so let's go to the compilation errors so"
8138080,8147840," arch yeah so we already have arch arch is supposed to be uh items and arch account right so that's what"
8147840,8158400," what it's supposed to be what are the compilation errors you want to throw at us uh it's account come on"
8158400,8166640," so we don't have an array lib rendering so because we need to copy paste it"
8167440,8182800," uh from here uh from here all right so let's post it somewhere here"
8185040,8193280," all right"
8193280,8202640," just to make sure i checked your dot files and uh it's really cpu temperature wow"
8202640,8207360," finally somebody figured out that you can do that you you're probably the first person who managed to"
8207360,8210720," do that or at least you're the first person who claimed that you managed to do that"
8211440,8217840," it's just like people keep asking me what all of that stuff in in your in your in your bar but you"
8217840,8224080," can literally look it up it's just like all online it's just like and it's it's all public"
8224080,8228320," all public you can just look it up and see it for yourself"
8228320,8240000," yes thank you so much i really appreciate you all right unironically actually unironically"
8241440,8252960," all right so uh we finally managed to create a gym right so it doesn't really have a configuration"
8252960,8258800," about like how many iterations you want to have and stuff like that but that's maybe fine like a lot of"
8258800,8266000," this stuff maybe in the future we can move to architecture file or to config file or something like"
8266000,8271440," that uh the thing i don't like about the data file is that you need to separate you need a separate"
8271440,8277600," program to generate it all right i mean that maybe that's just fine all right maybe that's just fine"
8277600,8282800," okay so let's actually try to run gym and see if it actually performs well like if it's actually doing"
8282800,8288400," anything uh yeah is it learning well the the cost function is actually decreasing"
8289920,8293360," at least so yeah it's slowly emerging"
8293360,8301840," i really like how it's just like they start to light up when you when you train this so cool"
8301840,8306560," so by the way another interesting thing i wanted to do believe it or not is"
8306560,8315600," change the thickness of the lines depending on their value that's one thing i would like to do yo"
8316160,8324480," let's quickly try to do that uh right so i'm going to just take a look at and then render ready uh right"
8324480,8331600," and uh so essentially where do we draw the lines so here are the lines so if i take a look at ray"
8331600,8340960," deep uh draw a draw line is there anything with thickness oh okay so yeah okay so draw line x so"
8340960,8347280," extend it and it allows you to draw with the thickness okay that's pretty cool so i suppose"
8347280,8355600," so the thickness comes before the color so this is going to be the thick so is it float it is float"
8355600,8364000," perfect so we can do float thick and then we're gonna have it as one so this one is gonna be x so"
8364960,8372240," interestingly so here is the sigmoid value so we take the value of the weight and we squash it with"
8372240,8380480," a sigmoid right so we can basically use the same value we know that it's going to be from zero to one"
8380480,8385440," right it's going to be from zero to one so that means we can have the thickness from zero to 10"
8385440,8390160," and just multiply it by the value and that will work automatically i think"
8390960,8398320," uh right so this one is actually has to be here there we go so that should work i think so let's"
8398320,8408880," give it a try i think it's gonna be pretty cool it doesn't work so too many things uh all right draw"
8408880,8417520," add bezier bezier curve look at that oh uh fucking really you're gonna have a draw line with separate"
8417520,8432960," components but draw line x with vector two and that okay sure uh can you construct uh vector a problem"
8432960,8444800," i don't know vector to start uh can i just do cx one cx c y one let me just end this one two"
8446160,8451200," it's gonna align"
8451200,8463360," literally unusable literally unusable i'm joking but i think they're a little bit too thick okay"
8463360,8473120," are they gonna become thinner they kind of become thinner yeah i feel like they're a little bit too thick"
8476160,8478720," but they're kind of fine"
8478720,8489680," so we can see how they're sort of like so what are the strongest things in here"
8489680,8495920," let's conclude"
8499200,8505360," we can take a look at the uh okay so i think 10 is too much right i think 10 is too much so what about"
8505360,8515440," five also i want to be able to print the epoch right so let's do uh epoch so this is fine all right so"
8518640,8536080," let's see if you're going to do one of the things i want to try is zor i think zor is going to be kind of"
8536080,8547360," interesting look at how thin it becomes like it became too thin yeah it become almost zero right it's just like this connection almost disappeared yeah"
8547680,8547920," yeah"
8547920,8552640," basically which is probably not particularly"
8552640,8555920," a good representation of this entire stuff"
8555920,8558800," but maybe it is so"
8558800,8562080," yeah that's why like people um"
8562080,8565360," yeah i know that this is wrong i know that this is one"
8566640,8568000," that's why i'm actually double"
8568000,8572080," thinking whether to include that or not"
8572080,8579920," but that's interesting nonetheless"
8579920,8583920," it's kind of interesting that looks cool at least and that's what gives the views"
8583920,8586400," i'm all right so who cares about correctness"
8586400,8591200," anyway so uh let me actually get rid of the thickness"
8591200,8594240," right so because i don't think it's particularly good idea"
8594240,8596480," uh right so"
8596480,8600080," but i'm going to keep the possibility to do the thickness anyway"
8604080,8606880," is an end calculation stuck to relieve max of ps yes"
8606880,8614560," that's why i was thinking about doing that in a separate thread at the beginning of the string"
8616720,8620240," but why i don't do that in a separate thread because it's unfinished"
8620240,8624160," zoisin why your unfinished code is unfinished"
8624160,8624720," ah"
8624720,8628240," okay"
8628240,8632160," all right so uh let me continue"
8632160,8637440," the finished code is unfinished"
8637440,8641840," um so what i want you to do i think what i want to do i want you to do xor"
8641840,8642960," right let's do xor"
8642960,8648800," uh arc so we have two inputs two and one right but for that"
8648800,8656480," we need to generate this kind of thing so yeah this is the very much inconvenient thing"
8658320,8659680," um right"
8659680,8671200," uh it will be kind of better so i suppose i have a feeling chad i have a strong feeling that"
8671200,8674960," the data has to be text for that"
8674960,8681680," i have a feeling the data has to be text for"
8681680,8688080," because this is like i i literally don't want to do that the thing i want to do"
8688320,8695760," with the xor matrix is just say okay uh we're going to have four uh over the"
8695760,8702960," uh four rows and how many columns are we going to have we have two inputs and one and three of these"
8702960,8708800," things and then i want to say okay uh zero zero uh zero one one"
8708800,8715600," one one and one zero and that's it i don't want to be dealing with the rest of this stuff"
8717680,8724880," um i don't know if you noticed but your unfinished code isn't finished yet how can you even stream"
8724880,8731600," this yeah that's a good question thank you so i feel like this is what i want to do"
8731600,8740640," if you know what i mean all right so i want to do that because it makes it easier to generate"
8741520,8745920," like a smaller data right just generate a smaller data"
8745920,8756720," so i feel like binary format it might be useful for like storage purposes if you know what i mean"
8756720,8759600," it could be useful for storage purposes but for"
8759600,8766080," uh for other purposes yeah we should have two kind of formats we definitely should have two kinds of"
8766080,8772800," of the format but look a binary one and the text one um all right so that's thing that's the thing that"
8772800,8781600," we definitely have to have right so and for the for the xor maybe i'm going to just like quickly generate"
8781600,8791760," zora i think i think i think that's one thing i can do um yeah let's go ahead and do that zora gen c"
8796160,8800560," and then implementation and then i'm going to just include and then that h"
8800560,8808640," um so i'm going to just do it like that so mat t"
8808640,8818800," mat alloc rows four and the columns three right so and one of the things we can do in here is essentially"
8818800,8825360," mat mat at t zero uh we can probably do it like so"
8825360,8826560," mat size t"
8826560,8831280," two"
8831280,8838640," t um"
8838640,8847040," it's more of a like two plus j i would say that's the role we have in here"
8848000,8857280," and the column uh zero has to be equal to i so we can say that this is a sample or maybe we can"
8857280,8858320," even call it a row"
8858320,8865920," maybe we can even call it a row all right so this is i this is j"
8865920,8877120," and this is i zero j after that let's actually print the results so this is a matrix print"
8878000,8880560," um build dot sh"
8880560,8887280," okay"
8887280,8887280," okay"
8887280,8900320," it's like what versus wasn't yeah probably because one is for machines another one for humans okay so this is"
8900320,8906160," what we managed to generate kind of what if we could just parse this entire thing"
8906160,8914400," yeah what if the format was literally just like this right you could just dump that and just read that"
8914400,8921440," uh because it also stores the information about the dimensions and stuff like that but the person that is kind of a s"
8922400,8929840," so uh i'm not sure anyway so what we want to do all right we want to actually do something like out"
8929840,8934240," f open uh so out file path"
8934240,8948000," right in binary const char out file path is going to be equal to what uh azure matrix all right so and if out is"
8948000,8951840," is equal to no uh the printf is the error"
8951840,8956400," could not open file s"
8956400,8966880," and n save out uh team and then we just close"
8966880,8968640," out"
8968640,8972640," printf generated"
8973200,8973520," yes"
8973520,8980400," okay let's try to generate some shite"
8980400,8986240," and then save keep forgetting it's just reflexes"
8986240,8992560," okay"
8992560,8997600," okay so looks good it looks good to me"
8998560,9002560," uh all right so we have a zor arc so this is zor arc"
9002560,9007120," and zor mat so that means now we can take a gym"
9007120,9011200," and provide zor architecture and zor"
9011200,9015280," matrix and just see how it's going to train this entire thing"
9015280,9021920," there we go so it is slowly training this entire stuff"
9025520,9031360," it's kind of interesting how uh this entire thing becomes negative this thing becomes negative this"
9031360,9034640," is negative but those things are positive and it's just like yeah"
9034640,9045040," that's pretty cool so that's basically i think so for the um"
9047680,9054880," for the thickness i think we could make it a tiny bit thicker right maybe maybe even three right so"
9054880,9061760," so we could at least see uh right this kind of stuff so it's going to gym"
9061760,9069280," uh zor um what is that architecture zor matrix let go"
9076640,9080240," yeah so i think the lines are a little bit easier to see now on the screen"
9080240,9085440," i wonder if it always converges to like these things to be negative"
9085440,9091680," yeah i think it becomes really really strong over time"
9091680,9095360," all right that's kind of cool"
9100240,9106800," that is kind of cool looks the same yeah it basically converges to the same thing"
9106800,9110720," right i suppose i suppose that's what it does it converges to the same thing"
9110720,9119040," uh right because maybe that's the optimal solution anyway right so it just will converge to the same"
9119040,9122960," thing in case of an adder right in case of an adder"
9125200,9127280," uh we should probably not rebuild everything"
9127280,9129280," i don't know why i'm doing that"
9129280,9134240," yeah"
9134240,9147760," yeah i should have actually made the weights uh thicker a little bit starting from the start because it just"
9147760,9148400," looks better"
9148400,9156480," man that's so cool it's actually so freaking cool"
9156480,9156800," i love it"
9156800,9165280," so another cool thing uh would be to"
9165280,9168800," plot the cost function as well"
9170320,9173200," so we got some bits from uh"
9173200,9178640," from nitrix dev thank you so much for having beats with the message i bought programming socks"
9178640,9181520," and now to x more productive thanks so it's your hook"
9181520,9186400," i actually don't have programming socks believe it or not that was a joke"
9186400,9189120," in that clip i was just like joking"
9189120,9193600," so i don't really have programming socks but i do still recommend to buy them"
9194320,9195600," i still recommend buying them"
9195600,9202480," man this is so awesome and it becomes brighter so"
9202480,9216320," so i suppose the disabled things are basically the gray one because they're closer to zero right"
9218560,9222480," and it stopped so okay it finished uh rendering essentially right so"
9222480,9225440," i mean uh train so this is basically the final result"
9225440,9228160," um"
9228160,9237920," fanboy outfit when uh when it stops being illegal in my country or when i actually get out of my country i"
9237920,9238480," i don't know"
9238480,9248400," okay god"
9248400,9255840," so that's actually pretty cool"
9255840,9263600," and then maybe you could have like a button save this neural network and it will just dump it in a binary or"
9263600,9267200," textual format it depends on like which one you want to use"
9267200,9271760," maybe there's some sort of like a standard formats is there any standardized way of"
9271760,9277120," storing this kind of stuff maybe we could just support the standard things so we can just load"
9277120,9282480," them up yeah that's a very interesting question right why invented our own formats if we could just like"
9282480,9290800," use existing ones and that will allow our library to actually maybe even evaluate uh existing models"
9291840,9297680," what sounds like um i don't know but i'll have to think about that"
9297680,9304720," so one thing i definitely wanted to have right one thing i definitely want to have is"
9304720,9311760," plotting the cost function as it learns you know what i mean i think that's quite important but we need to"
9311760,9315120," have some space for that right so because this entire thing is just like"
9315120,9321280," taken over by uh you know this entire stuff so which is not particularly convenient in my opinion"
9321280,9328960," so what i want to do i want to customize and then render raylib right and what i want to do in here"
9328960,9337200," essentially is specify at least like width and height right so i want to be able to specify the region"
9337200,9344960," within which it will render that specific neural network right so here i want to pass a rectangle"
9344960,9350720," and it will just draw that thing within that rectangle so rectangle is usually like x and y right"
9350720,9359520," x and y but for now i'm going to just start with uh just width and height right so this is going to be"
9359520,9367760," width and width and height so google search showed this an open source format for neural networks okay"
9367760,9375360," so let me check it out let me try to open it up open neural network okay so the fact that it's open"
9375360,9382560," doesn't really mean anything does anybody use it so there is a lot of open formats that nobody use"
9382560,9391760," right so is it actually used so that's the real question okay so there's a bunch of uh a bunch of logos of companies"
9394480,9402800," like i don't know i can imagine uh just a website for for a library that explains the library and then"
9402800,9408320," it says and here is a bunch of companies and it just lists a bunch of companies but it never says that"
9408320,9413680," the companies actually use your library it just said here's a bunch of companies it's just like a random"
9413680,9418240," companies were found in the internet like they have nothing to do with our library but here's a bunch"
9419360,9426800," because yeah because nobody is gonna read that they will see oh this is how many companies use that but"
9426800,9432240," they will never read the title that here's a bunch of libraries or companies you know what i mean"
9432240,9438400," because i mean wait a second"
9442400,9452000," yeah yeah nowhere on this page they say that this company actually used this format"
9452000,9457520," just think about that nowhere on this page they say that this company used this format"
9457520,9461920," so this could be just a list of random logos of random companies"
9466720,9471120," so again i know nothing about this format by the way i'm not trashing it i'm just like"
9471120,9478400," saying i'm not even ai person so what the thing i'm interested in is is it used i suppose it is used"
9478400,9478800," actually"
9478800,9487440," maybe in css selector yeah maybe maybe it's certain css select"
9488880,9495200," uh all right but i mean something exists so i'm gonna give the link uh to that in the description"
9495200,9497680," right so"
9497680,9500640," okay"
9500640,9511760," they have a pretty cool design and they have a pretty cool uh"
9515200,9521920," domain so that means they have money where did they get all of that money from i suppose suppose"
9521920,9528240," from the sponsors so that means that somebody probably uses that so that's my conclusion basically"
9528240,9534800," so i'll look into that uh after after history all right so let's actually try to um"
9534800,9541040," control the width and height of the region that we're rendering right so let's quickly replace"
9541680,9553200," uh image width with w there we go and then uh image height with h i'm not sure if that's a good idea"
9553200,9562160," but we'll see all right so if i try to recompile if i try to recompile it will fail by the way uh i think"
9562160,9566960," i don't need to compile these things right so because we already generated some data"
9568720,9573040," so in here we have to specify okay so we can say image width and image height"
9573040,9576080," image width and image height"
9576080,9578800," pores"
9578800,9586640," and okay so that seems to be working what if i uh divide it by half right what if i divide it by half"
9586640,9587360," so what's gonna happen"
9587360,9596960," okay so that actually rendered the entire thing in a smaller region which is precisely what i wanted but"
9596960,9602960," that didn't change the sizes of the neurons and this is because the size of the neurons don't depend"
9602960,9608720," on the size of the region they're rendered in so what i'm thinking is that we should make them dependent"
9608720,9614320," right so we should make them dependent so what is the size of the neurons so we draw the circle okay"
9614320,9622960," so there's a neuron radius so let's find this specific parameter so it's 25 let's make it dependent on the"
9624320,9631840," uh on this thing on the height for instance right so what is the height uh right so what is the height"
9631840,9640960," uh the height was 9 multiplied by 80 right so it was 25 uh right so we have this parameter"
9640960,9649440," and uh this is zero zero zero three maybe even four so essentially what we can say a new wrong radius we"
9649440,9659600," can make it float um and i suppose it's going to be just uh image height uh zero zero four or something"
9659600,9665760," like that right so let's actually use the original size in here all right let's try to use the original size"
9666560,9673360," and let me see let me see let me see okay so that looks reasonable now if i define divided by"
9673360,9677360," uh two right divided by two is it going to be smaller"
9679280,9685840," uh no it is not small what the uh is that because i'm a stupid dumb dumb"
9685840,9694960," yes i am because you're supposed to use h we've got a sub from my favorite person"
9694960,9701440," on planet earth um eleon thank you so much for uh tier two subscription thank you thank you thank you"
9701440,9712720," with the message by the way aren't you the author of focus right so focus editor i think you are the"
9712720,9719920," author actually there's a lot of contributors but they seem to be the um you know the main contributor to"
9719920,9727760," that thing focus editor i don't remember how to find that uh boot ls thank you so much for uh twitch"
9727760,9735120," from subscription thank you thank you thank you um so it's actually really cool really cool editor and"
9735120,9742560," um i'm a contributor i did i did the linux port okay uh in any case you seem to be like the person"
9742560,9747840," who contributed the most uh so if you guys are interested in jai and what people actually do with"
9747840,9752880," jai check out the focus it's a editor that is written completely in jai and it's actually super cool"
9753520,9763040," uh so it doesn't work for me actually you know what uh for me it crashes and you know what it crashes"
9763040,9766960," with uh it crashes with sigill"
9766960,9778640," uh and it crashes on mu hash in a play in the places where it uses some sse instructions or something like"
9778640,9785520," that so it feels like it uses some instructions that my cpu doesn't support and it i didn't look"
9785520,9791760," into that problem i just tried to run it and this is what i saw but that's kind of weird right so this"
9791760,9798320," is just something like i didn't report uh any bug because i was not sure if that's like my problem or"
9798320,9804000," something else right so uh a little bit later if i if i remember i will try to investigate and see what's"
9804000,9810480," up with that but that's uh that's rather interesting so in any case i'm gonna because it's actually super"
9810480,9816000," cool i really want to try it try it out uh i'm gonna give the thing in the description as well"
9819200,9830000," text editor right and uh some um some ai format"
9830000,9840080," what's it really useful it's basically a signal when that is sent when um you try to"
9840080,9846800," execute a legal instruction right so it could be hardware i think or it could be something else"
9848320,9853120," it's not necessarily like a known instruction per se it could be some sort of a bug that made"
9853120,9862960," uh the instruction pointer jump for instance in the middle of an instruction right so and that resulted"
9862960,9870080," in like just combination of bytes that is not the correct instruction uh right it could be either"
9870080,9875760," like a usage of actually instructions that is not supported by my hardware it could be my hardware problem"
9875760,9880720," or it could be something within the application that made it jump to a wrong place or something like"
9880720,9881440," that it depends"
9881440,9890240," if you build locally you get the same crash actually building locally is the only thing i tried i didn't"
9890240,9897920," try the official uh executable or anything like that right so yeah i can maybe i can maybe show you"
9897920,9901600," all right so let's actually quickly go here"
9901600,9911680," so i think i have an old gi right now so i didn't test on the one that actually got released recently"
9911680,9912320," so we'll see"
9912320,9919040," so let me take a look at the version so here is the version"
9920560,9930480," um yeah so yeah it's far from the latest one unfortunately uh okay so do we have first okay"
9930480,9938480," so i'm gonna just like use um first and see how it goes set uh and declared identify yeah okay so my joy"
9938480,9947600," is too old okay uh i'll check it out later and if i find anything worth reporting i will report a bug about that"
9947600,9955120," all right so yeah my joy is too old so it's already fixed and nightly by the way"
9955120,9965200," okay so let's actually continue what i was doing um all right uh i forgot what i wanted yeah okay"
9965920,9975440," so let's actually see now if it um you know yeah okay so as you can see neurons are smaller now which"
9975440,9985360," is cool which is nice so but uh the width of the of the thing right the width of the thing uh of the uh"
9985360,9990000," weight still doesn't depend on the height so this is something that we'll probably also have to do"
9990480,9996400," all right all right all right so the width if i'm not mistaken all right so thickness is actually three"
9996400,10002400," all right if we divide three by one what was that i already forgot um"
10002400,10017680," so 980 right so that and three uh okay so this is zero zero four so thick uh we can do h"
10019440,10030000," uh four so that's basically what we're doing here zero zero four yeah it's kind of the same right so zero"
10030000,10037920," zero four and zero zero four that's an interesting coincidence i think that's a very interesting"
10037920,10044480," coincidence all right so that looks better isn't that cool all right so now i can just like change"
10044480,10050960," the sizes in here right i can divide it by i can make it even smaller i think you can make it even"
10050960,10060400," smaller so at some point i think the lines may become invisible right uh and then for instance maybe"
10060400,10066240," i can multiply this entire thing by by two which will actually go outside of the window but it's going"
10066240,10071680," to be bigger so we can now control the size of the thing that we can render yeah so that's actually pretty"
10071680,10078960," cool all right all right and the entire like width and sizes are very much dependent on the height so"
10078960,10084480," that's how we operate but that's not enough right that's not enough another thing i want to be able to"
10084480,10094240," do is to specify the offset for the entire thing right so right now uh the offset is at zero okay so this is"
10094240,10101760," actually pretty cool so we control the offset with nn x and n and y which makes it relatively easy to"
10101760,10109840," just do something like this right with x and y um so let's actually rename those things to maybe r x r y"
10109840,10120880," meaning rectangle or region so and then we can say okay offset that by r x or y right so it's gonna be x or y"
10121440,10125280," something like this okay so let's go through the completion errors there will be some compilation errors"
10125280,10138000," uh right that we need to fix uh so this is another thing uh what else uh so unused parameters so that's"
10138000,10146480," fine so and in here okay so here we have to specify zero for now at least so what i want to do right what i"
10146480,10155840," want to do i want to center it somehow right so let's say that uh the actual width is going to be image"
10155840,10163680," width uh divided by two and actual height is going to be image height divided by two as well the actual x"
10163680,10173440," in that case is going to be image width uh divided by two minus rw divided by two and y so we sort of like a"
10173440,10180880," centering this entire thing uh which makes it super easy to just do rx or y uh rw or h"
10180880,10190480," and is it going to center this entire thing we'll see we'll see yeah it's centered so that means we can"
10190480,10197280," just pick whatever region we want and we can say render the entire neural network within that region so"
10197280,10202880," which makes it super easy to just relocate it to different stuff and allocate some space for instance"
10202880,10210960," for the plotting of the cost function isn't that cool right i think that's pretty cool uh right for"
10210960,10218720," instance i can say that uh i want this entire thing to start at zero right so that will align uh this"
10218720,10227600," entire thing to the left and it's aligned to the left essentially right so and we can plot the cost"
10227600,10234400," function somewhere here on the right or maybe we can maybe align it towards the right because maybe"
10234400,10239840," i want to have the plot function uh there so uh let me see how we can do that it's essentially"
10240480,10249520," our this minus actually image width right so it's image width minus rw and that will align it to the"
10249520,10258960," right right very cool yeah i know thank you right so that's pretty progress uh we can actually do another"
10258960,10266720," cool thing we can say that the height is actually going to be the whole height right so that will stretch"
10266720,10272400," the neural network up right because it's now like half of a height so we can control this kind of"
10272400,10276880," thing and let's see how it's going to look like uh it's going to look differently and we can't see"
10276880,10284080," shit in this which is kind of surprising yeah because this is not what we were supposed to be doing"
10284080,10290160," uh what we were supposed to be doing is setting the height like this in here okay so that makes sense"
10292160,10297280," right uh there we go so it's just stretch it like that which doesn't really look that great"
10297280,10303600," in my opinion if you ask me but that's one way to do that right"
10303600,10314320," anyway so i suppose i could just make um this thing i think half was all right i think half was all right"
10315200,10323360," just to be able to see like how it goes um maybe not even half maybe two thirds how about two thirds"
10323360,10330640," right so multiply by two but divide by three two thirds it could be like a cool middle ground"
10330640,10333120," yeah that's that's a good middle ground in my opinion i think"
10337040,10345600," it's pretty pretty pretty uh all right so and uh where are we going to render the"
10345600,10353360," um the cost function right so with the cost function what we need to do right so we need to have"
10353360,10361440," um we need to store the samples of the cost functions somewhere right so we need to periodically"
10361440,10369200," just check what's the current cost and we need to add it to some sort of array uh right so maybe i'm"
10369200,10375440," going to introduce like a dynamic array is definitely going to be dynamic array right so cost plot right"
10375440,10381520," and we're going to have items which are floats right so here we're going to have a count and here we have"
10381520,10391040," we're going to have a capacity right and essentially um periodically periodically if i is divided by"
10391840,10398800," 10 equal to 10 equal to zero instead of printing that cost we're going to be appending that cost to the"
10398800,10408000," plot right so we can do di append maybe we're going to have like a plot and we just literally add this"
10408000,10413280," entire thing to the plot and that's it right and then we're when we are rendering this entire stuff"
10413280,10418560," um are we going to be taking that plot and we're going to be just like literally rendering it"
10418560,10423840," that's that's it basically uh we'll see how it goes we'll see how it goes"
10423840,10432000," okay so here is an interesting thing so and then render raylib uh it cleans the entire background but"
10432000,10438160," since it's just a small sort of like a sub widget i think it should not be responsible for cleaning the"
10438160,10443040," entire background it should be done outside somewhere here right like so"
10443040,10447440," yeah so we probably want to do something like this"
10447440,10453520," so we begin rendering clean the background and here we clean this entire thing"
10453520,10463440," so and uh probably i want to do something like a cost uh like render maybe plot uh cost"
10463440,10469600," right and then here uh i could specify the plot right and i probably need to put it somewhere here"
10469600,10479600," right cost plot plot zero right so it's going to be like that and uh here we'll have to specify"
10479600,10486560," uh the region within which we want to render this entire thing right so i suppose we can do a similar"
10486560,10497760," thing right we can do a similar thing uh but we'll need to re-initialize this stuff right so what i'm"
10497760,10503440," thinking is that in terms of width is going to be half of the width in terms of heights let's keep the the"
10503440,10510880," same height but the difference here is that it's going to be aligned uh from the left right so on the left"
10510880,10516560," we're going to have a cost function on the right we're going to have uh the the neural network so"
10516560,10522400," maybe it would be even better to actually swap these things around uh and to be able to easily swap them"
10522400,10531200," around i think i'm going to do something like this int r w r h r x r y there we go so that way i"
10531200,10538640," have these sort of components right uh that i can swap around and stuff like that and everything um"
10538640,10544960," okay so let's implement a plot cost right so let's see where we can put this entire stuff"
10544960,10554480," uh-huh so this is going to be just uh cost plot uh and this is going to be just a bunch of inputs"
10558000,10567840," so for now um just to see that it's working right i'm going to just draw a rectangle right and draw"
10567840,10574400," like a red rectangle just to see where it's going to be located uh draw a rectangle so it accepts"
10574400,10585120," everything i want i want to see or h red and let's try to run this entire thing so plot uh unused variable"
10585120,10591280," background color okay so background color is not particularly neat uh right because we moved this"
10591280,10598560," stuff outside so let's put it in here uh plot is unused let's okay so that's that's cool so this is"
10598560,10603200," where we're going to have a plot right so this is where we have the neural network so and the left"
10603200,10607840," widget this is where we're going to have all that so the padding comes from the fact that we're taking"
10607840,10614400," two thirds of the height i think is this two thirds does it look like two thirds i guess i guess it is"
10614400,10619840," right so if you add up this padding and this padding it actually adds up to a third of the height of the"
10619840,10630800," screen so that kind of makes sense right who needs css chat right who needs css like it's actually way"
10630800,10637840," easier to do whatever you want without css because it doesn't stay on your way am i the only one am i"
10637840,10646400," crazy by the way i find it easier to come up with the very flexible layouts if i don't have this css"
10646400,10653440," craziness and i'm just allowed to place things uh like in absolute values right i'm not alone okay"
10653440,10658240," that's cool right if you have if you just have variables and you place all of the elements in"
10658240,10665680," absolute terms you can quite easily come up with very flexible layouts like it's just like yeah centering"
10665680,10671280," is just you take half of the screen half of the size of the element and you subtract one thing from"
10671280,10678080," another and magically it's centered without any of this freaking with centered left right like why"
10678080,10684640," you take one half and subtract another half it's a simple arithmetical operations anyone can do that"
10684640,10693760," even designers i mean i've met actually very smart uh designers that know like geometry and mathematics"
10693760,10702080," quite well so just i'm just saying uh still use tables and you can also emulate it's like simulate tables"
10702080,10706480," sometimes i feel maybe it's because i'm a c programmer and it's just like if you"
10707200,10713920," if you know how to use the hammer right everything looks like a nail but i find like defining things"
10713920,10725760," like that easier a bit i would accept this bullshit called css but nothing ever worked yeah it's really"
10725760,10733520," difficult to do anything in css anyways all right so how are we going to be plotting this interesting how"
10733520,10739840," we're going to be plotting this simple stuff um so one of the things we can do"
10739840,10750320," we can find the maximum right so uh because we want to be able to fit this entire thing somewhere"
10750320,10759120," right like in in width and height um so let's find the maximum yeah the maximum value like cost plot"
10760000,10764000," max and then the float uh cost plot"
10764000,10775040," float max uh so and it has to be the the minimum value right the minimum is there something"
10775040,10784720," a full team right so that's probably what we want to do uh so for css is difficult even for the browser"
10784720,10790000," yeah i can imagine that actually uh let's see what you're talking about"
10790000,10804880," so if max is less than plot items i what we do is just say okay it's equal to this thing now and"
10805040,10816640," we just have to return max so okay uh we need to have the maximum value cost plot max it's kind of"
10816640,10822080," math to do that on each plot cost but we're not trying to write the most optimal code ever right so we"
10822080,10831040," don't really care that much in my opinion all right and essentially uh now uh do we also want to have like a"
10831040,10839040," i think minimum i think minimum is also very important right so uh we can do that in one go uh let's do min max"
10839040,10847040," min max all right so it's going to be min uh this is going to be max and right so let's do min uh"
10847040,10853040," uh foti max max max foti mean right and maybe just"
10853040,10867040," just maybe i'm going to do the following thing min if it's greater i'm going to set it and here we don't have to return anything so it means here i'm going to have"
10867040,10880560," i'm gonna have min max and then cost plot max plot min max who needs multiple return values am i right"
10880560,10893600," all right so min and max so that means we can already do quite a cool shite quite a cool shite"
10895040,10901280," uh and it's essentially yeah let's iterate through all of these things right so iterate through all of the samples"
10901280,10904720," uh plot uh count"
10904720,10911680," by the way i just want to like compile this entire thing yeah flt max and flt min"
10911680,10920560," are not a thing but i don't remember i probably have to include limits if i'm not mistaken"
10922000,10927760," uh see float oh there is also float i'll see okay"
10927760,10939760," fault which one yeah boy yeah boy okay that's cool uh cost boats okay"
10939760,10945840," all right pretty epic not gonna lie not gonna lie"
10950000,10961200," mm-hmm uh so uh zero less than plot counts uh count plus plus plus i"
10961200,10969280," so okay in terms of why it's rather easy to determine how it's going to look like all right so essentially"
10971440,10981280," uh essentially we have a plot items so this is i and we can subtract the minimum out of that and it gives"
10981280,10989920," us this sort of value all right and what we need to do we need to divide it by maximum minus the minimum"
10989920,10996640," right by the distance and what we get is actually a value from zero to one right it's a value from zero to one"
10996640,11005040," so if we multiply it by the height we get the value somewhere on the height of the widget"
11005040,11011760," right but it's not going to be offset properly uh so another thing we have to do we'll have to do our y"
11011760,11019600," plus and that gives us y uh precisely on the widget itself so the the only thing we need to do we need to"
11019600,11027040," figure out x so the bigger the i the bigger the i the bigger the x the bigger the i the bigger the x the"
11027040,11033600," bigger the i the bigger the x so that means it depends on i right what we can do we can take the"
11033600,11042160," width and i think it has to be converted to float and we want to divide it by the plot count right and then"
11042160,11050800," multiply by i that's freaking it so the next thing we can then try to do once we've got x and y we can"
11050800,11056480," just plot the points right so it would be nice to connect them with lines but i'm going to just draw"
11056480,11064080," circles on uh you know on the place of them right how we're going to draw the circle uh so i remember so"
11064080,11072960," it's a center so this is going to be x and y uh and the radius is going to be dependent on r uh rh we"
11072960,11080160," already learned that and let's actually make it as small as the uh width of the um weight right so"
11080160,11085440," zero zero four essentially and the color let's actually pick color red because why not so i think"
11085440,11093440," red is fine uh and that should give us the plot cost i suppose isn't that cool i think that's pretty cool"
11094640,11102000," so uh something dangerous or x is not used yeah thank you that's very important"
11102000,11109920," okay are we good are we gucci are we tamaguchi huh"
11113200,11118800," that's actually that's actually all right the question is why is it growing"
11118800,11127120," what i'm thinking chat is that the height"
11127120,11131760," wait is it"
11137920,11139280," are the wise"
11139280,11142080," inverted"
11142080,11149040," wait a second i i need to check that chat this is very important"
11149040,11159120," draw circle is that is this one of these libraries that put zero at left bottom"
11162560,11169120," all right all right so zero zero one hundred all right show me what you've got"
11169120,11174160," no okay"
11174160,11180960," what's up with that so am i am i needed i think i'm an idiot"
11183840,11192720," because initially why um so initially it has to be rather big isn't it i'm pretty sure"
11192720,11200640," okay so let's maybe connect that with lines"
11200640,11205520," right so let's connect that with lines and see how is it going a draw line"
11207840,11219120," so draw line"
11219120,11228720," so we'll put it in here but that only makes sense actually if uh y"
11233280,11235280," if y plus one"
11235280,11245360," is less so here is the thing uh i suppose we need to do something like minus one to make sure"
11245360,11246320," or maybe even"
11246320,11252800," i plus one right because we're talking about like um unsigned integers and stuff like that"
11252800,11257360," uh right so this is going to be that uh this is going to be"
11259440,11273280," in max two this one is going to be plus one and this one is going to be plus one so x1 uh y1 x2 y2"
11273280,11286080," and uh the color is red maybe we can even do something like this the thickness is rh multiplied by"
11286080,11289360," zero zero zero zero zero zero four like so"
11289360,11300880," semi colon what else do you want uh expected for draw x line"
11300880,11304160," ah this freaking okay"
11306960,11324480," so vector two"
11324480,11329680," uh yeah i need to yeah i can see why i need to invert y now"
11331520,11340240," yeah okay so that makes sense actually so let's go ahead and try to invert why so but we can invert"
11340240,11345520," actually the one right so this value is from zero to one right so we can just do something like this"
11345520,11354000," uh easy peasy no squeezy right so that should actually work now i suppose"
11356960,11357360," yo"
11357360,11367600," it would be kind of nice to also provide some sort of a reference point i don't know"
11367600,11370640," but yeah because it's not clear"
11370640,11381520," where is the yeah it's kind of cool that it just like jumps all right so we also take the steps of like"
11381520,11386640," 10 but maybe this is not what we should do all right what if we like take each individual"
11386640,11389120," thing in here is it going to be faster"
11389120,11391280," yo"
11391280,11398160," it's kind of interesting how it learns in jumps"
11398160,11402560," you know what i mean it learns it learns in these jumps"
11403920,11411200," all right it's sort of like uh energy levels right so the flake energy levels"
11411200,11419440," it's actually kind of cool right and it doesn't really improve that much overall anymore right"
11419440,11432000," okay that's good so um let me let me see so maybe i could make it a bit thicker right this entire thing"
11432960,11433920," cost plot"
11433920,11443520," so in terms of thickness we can say so the beer the value in here yeah so let's actually make it"
11443520,11449920," zero zero five right can i make the window resizable"
11449920,11452800," that's a good question"
11452800,11460640," i kind of want to make it resizable so that i can just resize and see how it changes and stuff like that"
11460640,11466720," so uh there is an init window right let me see uh if i can do anything about that we need to window"
11466720,11468240," uh-huh"
11468240,11473280," resize is window resized"
11473280,11484480," set window i suppose we can set window uh state right platform set window configuration set using flags"
11485120,11488640," okay so it doesn't what kind of flags do i have"
11488640,11494560," so i can set window size uh resizing"
11494560,11498000," is window resized"
11498000,11505680," okay so i think i need to google that up uh array leap resizable window"
11509760,11513760," resizable windows so people discuss that on reddit"
11513760,11524160," i found flag resizable window mentioned over here"
11527920,11531440," okay okay good so 2016"
11531440,11537600," uh just added new flags thank you race and five i really appreciate that"
11537600,11545440," set uh i suppose it's set uh windows state can i get windows state"
11548000,11550960," because i don't know because i don't know what if i"
11550960,11566160," what if i set the flags and i reset some other things okay i should i should just go ahead and try"
11566160,11570240," that right set window state uh and what was the flag"
11570240,11581600," yeah there are literally flags so i'm not sure how good of an idea that is but we'll see"
11585760,11593440," no no i can't resize this i still can't resize it it didn't change i don't know how to make it resizable"
11593440,11601840," web slow"
11609440,11615520," do i have to do that before i create the window so that's very interesting question maybe that's what"
11615520,11616080," i have to do"
11616080,11621920," because the code in the source code can implies"
11621920,11628000," set window"
11633840,11634640," it doesn't work"
11634640,11636640," it doesn't work i don't know why and i'm sure if i care"
11636640,11642960," i basically implemented everything i wanted to implement right um almost"
11642960,11649200," almost almost almost almost so"
11649200,11656720," it would be kind of nice to maybe use zero as the minimum you know what i mean"
11656720,11658720," so"
11661040,11666400," i'm gonna just overwrite minimal to zero and let's see how it goes i think"
11666400,11675360," yeah i think because that's yeah that's better i'm just a little bit afraid okay so how are we gonna"
11675360,11685040," handle the situation when it goes below the zero it's actually super easy uh if min less than zero"
11686480,11694160," actually if it's greater than zero it becomes zero that's it so essentially the if it ever goes below"
11694160,11700640," uh we're gonna leave it as it is but if it's higher uh we're gonna still snap it to zero so that's"
11700640,11701360," basically what it is"
11701360,11710160," uh that's basically this set config flex okay i'll take a look at set config plus all right so that's much"
11710160,11716800," better so you can see how this entire thing sort of like um getting smaller and smaller it will be"
11716800,11724000," also kind of cool to have the initial limit for x if you know what i mean right so we can do something"
11724000,11733200," similar for from for x so this is minimum for x and we divide this entire thing by count uh but"
11733200,11737520," essentially we have this sort of n"
11737520,11741200," all right if you know what i mean"
11741200,11747200," all right and and we can say all right so if n"
11747200,11756080," less than 100 that means it's going to be 100. all right if it's bigger uh we're going to let it be bigger"
11756080,11760960," here right so that way uh we're going to have a very interesting effect in here"
11760960,11764320," um yeah"
11764320,11770880," isn't that cool we can even make it i don't know uh"
11770880,11778000," 1000. that's even cooler i think please tell me that it's cool look at that"
11778000,11783120," yeah"
11786080,11787440," so um"
11787440,11792240," yeah i mean this has to be thousand"
11792240,11802160," so we can see how the neural network is learning so this is its cost function we also can add some"
11802160,11807520," sort of a grid we can also add some sort of a grid so we can see how all of that so there's"
11807520,11812800," a lot of things you can improve in here uh you can keep improving and improving and yeah"
11814160,11818400," so this is something that i noticed with a lot of models when i was like"
11818400,11822960," experimenting with this kind of stuff that they jump very quickly at the beginning and"
11822960,11828560," then once they sort of figured out their configuration they're doing like a very small"
11828560,11835040," optimizations to this uh configuration you know what i mean it's kind of an interesting effect that"
11835040,11838560," if you've never done that you would ever expect so it's sort of like"
11838560,11843360," goes through this energy levels right and then it finds the configuration then it smoothes out and"
11843360,11850000," something like that that's something interesting right like why is it doing that like why like what"
11850000,11857440," makes it do this kind of jumps this is very interesting right um"
11857440,11864480," so okay and it just keeps improving stuff like that it's really cool that we can also see that"
11864480,11874880," um so let me let me see so somebody suggested that we need set config flags so let me take a look at what that is"
11876640,11883520," set config flags uh all right set initial configuration for see view flags"
11883520,11891440," okay i suppose do i just have to set that thing there uh init window"
11900880,11908000," is that what i'm gonna just assume i don't know like i probably need to read the content okay that's cool"
11908000,11919520," all right so now how can i get the size of the window get window size so i can get window position"
11922320,11940720," the jumps are maybe related to the learning step yeah maybe we can actually make half of the learning step"
11940720,11948320," right so and see if it's going to make any difference so this is a half of the learning step"
11949520,11954480," the the jumps are smoother anyway but they still exist"
11954480,11962240," so i made like a half of the step the original step but they still exist"
11962240,11972000," oh you have to get the width and height of the windows separately jesus christ the consistency of this api"
11973360,11979840," is the top notch but by the way i'm not dissing this library by the way right so i think this library is"
11979840,11987280," very cool let me get it out of the way this library is pretty cool so it's just like me being grumpy when"
11987280,11994560," i'm working right so when i'm working and doing an actual that actually works it gets"
11995360,12003040," my brain in a very specific state where i'm very critical about literally everything right so that's"
12003040,12009440," why it may feel because people see me only in that mode right so people see me only in that mode and they"
12009440,12015280," assume that i'm very grumpy very angry person in reality i'm not actually uh right so it's just like"
12015280,12021760," when i'm working and actually need to get something working i get in this very like state where where i'm"
12021760,12026960," critical of everything and it may look like i'm very grumpy and angry but it's just like it's a part of my"
12026960,12044320," process right uh it's a part of my process okay so let me let me see uh get window"
12046000,12051920," get window width get screen width but does it give me"
12051920,12064080," uh get current i suppose it render width right uh get window"
12064080,12071360," i suppose it has to be get render with it must be kind of it okay so we're gonna assume that this"
12071360,12088720," this function caches all these values so i can call it as many times as you want because i'm too lazy to"
12088720,12098480," cache it myself okay so yeah"
12098480,12103840," that's good so as you can see it adapts now"
12108640,12116240," very adaptive thingy"
12116240,12124240," we can even make a cost plot maybe a ring"
12124240,12131760," right how is it called ring buffer so it basically removes the old things but it's actually very"
12131760,12136880," important you kind of want to see the whole path anyway i don't think removing that stuff is a good idea"
12136880,12141840," yeah i think so yeah i think so so it's better to actually see like literally everything"
12141840,12144480," it's way better to see everything"
12144480,12145840," everything"
12145840,12147840," so"
12147840,12150320," that's pretty cool"
12150320,12158800," so we can now also try to test other neural network which is zor and it's way way simpler but"
12158800,12161360," it will be able to show us still some process"
12161360,12168240," yep so is it gonna do another jump i'm pretty sure it's gonna do another jump at some point"
12168240,12172960," it's going for a jump it's going for a jump it's gonna make it i'm pretty sure no it's not thinking"
12179680,12185840," no it doesn't really uh it's kind of doing a jump"
12185840,12191440," okay cool"
12191440,12200640," so and as far as i know by the way you also have a text don't you"
12202160,12205920," so we can render some shit like some additional information about what the"
12205920,12209520," fuck is going on so we can replace i with epoch"
12213840,12214480," um"
12214480,12216720," and then"
12216720,12220880," and just like"
12220880,12222000," print the actual"
12222000,12228720," is that how you pronounce that word i'm not pretty sure but"
12228720,12235440," um so uh let me do something like maybe yeah it's kind of annoying"
12236800,12238160," uh so i'm gonna put like this"
12238160,12252160," there we go so that's what we have and uh in here"
12252160,12263040," in here we can do something like uh arraylib draw text it's image draw text just draw text"
12263680,12274880," yeah boy and it requires like the actual uh string so i suppose"
12274880,12278640," oh okay"
12278640,12283920," i put an accent on all because this is how"
12283920,12289360," we put accent in russian language so in russian language it's called epocha"
12290560,12298560," so we put accent on o um and that's like just what my brain used to do so i really apologize"
12298560,12302160," okay so let's actually have some sort of a buffer so this is going to be something like"
12302160,12307200," this and we can do a sem printf uh epoch"
12307200,12317040," same in german okay so so we're going to put uh i suppose z u in here and um so epoch"
12318400,12325440," all right um so we probably have to specify the buffer all right so we specify the buffer and the"
12325440,12334240," size of the buffer uh all right so buffer so where we're going to put that i suppose in terms"
12334240,12341120," of x it's going to be zero and in terms of y uh let's let's also make it a zero so in terms"
12341120,12346160," of font it's going to be interesting i think it should depend on the size of the window right so"
12346800,12354240," we can say it's going to be maybe something like this right so in terms of the color let's make it"
12354240,12361520," white right so and let's see how it's going to go um so the fact that we can draw text is actually"
12361520,12369360," that's a very huge ass apple so let's make it smaller maybe even this small"
12371680,12377200," yeah yeah that's better that's actually really cool"
12377200,12385280," it's really funny how it's just like"
12385280,12395360," so we can see some here uh another thing i would like to do is probably some sort of a grid"
12396000,12399920," if you know what i mean right some sort of a grid would have been actually super useful"
12399920,12405280," um yeah but i'm already streaming for almost four hours but"
12405280,12410560," so all the necessary information is available in here we can even do"
12411760,12421600," uh something like out of the max uh so all right max"
12421600,12427680," size to max and we can put in here all right then we can just do"
12436080,12438080," yeah so as you can see"
12438080,12447760," it even says like how many are we going to do and how quick is it moving so it's limited by the fps as"
12447760,12452640," we already discussed it's limited by the fps to make it not limited by the fps i would like to"
12452640,12460880," actually run the learning process in the separate thread so that will require uh you know doing p threads and"
12460880,12466800," stuff like that but overall that's kind of cool we can provide more information in here in fact"
12466800,12472160," we can say rate all right and here we can put the rate"
12472160,12480880," maybe a rate and the maximum amount of epochs could be configured somehow"
12484800,12490080," you can run multiple learning iterations per frame yep true maybe that would be faster"
12490080,12495280," so"
12495280,12500560," for example"
12500560,12509360," less than like 10 right and it would be also kind of nice to maybe"
12511280,12514720," do something like this so let's actually run 10"
12514720,12518240," yeah that's a good idea"
12518240,12525760," so 10 learning iteration that's actually way faster what the fuck yeah that's a good idea"
12525760,12532160," thank you and we're done learning"
12532160,12538320," sounds pretty cool that was way faster so let's try the editor now"
12541280,12541520," okay"
12541520,12551040," yeah that learns even even faster when it iterates faster i think it's more spectacular in terms of"
12551040,12557360," like if you look at the right right i think it's more spectacular it would be kind of cool to also"
12557360,12563360," handle like r and restart this entire thing without like a compilation but i mean i can just restart the"
12563360,12573440," the application like some"
12573440,12576080," that's so cool"
12576080,12577840," holy shit"
12577840,12579600," right"
12581760,12588400," so awesome i love that this is actually a very cool tool right this gym thingy it's actually really cool"
12588400,12590240," yo"
12590240,12594080," that is awesome"
12600800,12609920," all right so now we have a gym uh so i'm gonna clean it up off screen a little bit right and then"
12609920,12615520," i'm gonna like post the cleaned version to on the source code on github so we'll be able to read one"
12615520,12622960," there so yeah that's pretty cool so it would be kind of cool to actually do everything from that single"
12622960,12629600," application and then just dump the neural network and then you would use an end of age to sort of"
12629600,12634880," deploy and integrate the neural network that you trained into your application right"
12634880,12641120," so but yeah that's the result of today's stream like this is literally what we do within like today's"
12641120,12646800," stream right thank you so much the creator of the array leap for such a beautiful library"
12647600,12652400," uh i think their name their nickname is race m5 thank you thank you so much it's actually very cool"
12652400,12654880," i kind of like this library better than sdl honestly"
12654880,12661600," i think i think it's better than this you know like it was super easy to build completely from scratch"
12661600,12669360," by the way all right so just like install it and use it and uh it does way more than sdl as far as i"
12669360,12675040," know it even allows you to define your own shaders right so but if i remember correctly it doesn't"
12675040,12680880," really abstract shaders away so you you have to be aware of the back end it's currently using to come"
12680880,12687280," up with the correct traders but maybe it does something for that i'm not quite sure uh so yeah"
12687280,12696480," i really like how the highlight is like so freaking cool"
12698560,12705360," uh and then they refine all right so i guess that's it for today thanks everyone who's watching me right"
12705360,12709920," now i really appreciate it have a good one and i see you all on next"
12709920,12713920," love you"
