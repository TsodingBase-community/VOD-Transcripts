880,7120," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session"
7120,11600," with a mr zozin how about that but you didn't expect that to happen let's make a little bit"
11600,17280," of announcement and officially start the stream as usual as usual live on twitch and what are we"
17280,26080," doing today on twitch.tv website today we're doing uh own my name style uh but in c uh and"
26080,34080," with rayley right so my own my name style library with uh c and ready so essentially for those who"
34080,39440," doesn't know i forgot to actually like ping and stuff like that jesus christ twitch.tv/todding"
39440,44560," right so and ping everyone who's interested in being pink i wonder if it will actually it actually"
44560,49520," highlighted it as it's pink so i suppose now everyone is pinked so everything is gucci everything is"
49520,55760," tamaguchi so right uh essentially if you heard about the channel three blue one brown right you probably"
56080,62320," uh know about his animation engine uh thingy which is called manium uh right and essentially i want"
62320,68480," to have kind of similar thing for my uh for my youtube channel right so for uh for making animations about"
68480,74880," programming concepts and stuff like that so and since i'm a programmer right it only makes sense uh it only"
74880,79520," makes sense to actually make it myself from scratch right so not necessarily from scratch we're going to"
79520,85440," be using really but really uh is going to be needed for just putting some shapes on the screen and stuff"
85440,93200," like that so an idea is going to be that um i'm going to reuse some of the technology technology that i"
93200,100880," developed uh in mutualizer right so you probably know about these things mutualizer so essentially one of the"
100880,107920," things we'll need from mutualizer is an ability to render ff like videos with ffmpeg uh right so i'm"
107920,114160," going to put the link to mutualizer in here uh so we're going to strip of this um you know we're going"
114160,121600," to steal this ability of like rendering videos with ffmpeg from mutualizer uh right and another thing i"
121600,128240," will probably need is an ability to hot reload uh our application because you're going to be writing animations"
128240,133360," uh with the c code right so that means you need to have a sort of like a very short feedback loop"
133360,138880," right so essentially you modify something you want to see that changes instantly on the screen so because"
138880,144160," of that we're going to steal some hot reloading technology from mutualizer as well right so and"
144160,153200," essentially i'm like i envision that framework that engine to be just a library that you link with"
153200,158480," right so each individual animation so to speak is going to be a library and execute them"
158480,165040," an executable right an executable that links with that library and then it then it has an ability to"
165040,170960," generate the the final videos and stuff like that so that that's basically how i see that uh and that's"
170960,176000," basically what i'm going to be going for right for today so yeah we're going to start doing all of"
176000,180320," that and we'll see how it goes that's the plan for today essentially that's the plan for today"
180320,185840," so i'm going to call it panning right so because monium is a mathematical animation engine this one"
185840,191440," is going to be programming animation engine right so i think it only makes sense uh so let's make"
191440,196000," maybe a little bit of a boilerplate uh my name is one three blow brownies yeah yeah so it's written"
196000,201920," in python it's i don't really know what like how exactly it works and what kind of things it uses"
201920,210320," uh right so but yeah so like from the from how it looks like it seems pretty straightforward to implement"
210320,215120," it right so i don't know like i didn't see any particular difficulties in there except like it has"
215120,219760," cool animations over the vectors of the phones and stuff like that we're probably not going to go into"
219760,224320," there yet but maybe at some point we're going to have something with the vectors and animating the"
224320,227600," vector representations svg and stuff like that we'll see how it goes"
228640,234960," uh it all it also has a cool mathematic rendering with latex and shed so i don't know how exactly it"
234960,241440," renders the later uh i suppose it just calls uh to later has an external program right so this is"
241440,247760," something that we can try to do as well um right so i suppose maybe it just like asks later to generate"
247760,253520," some svgs then it loads those svgs and having the vector it can kind of animate that based on the vector"
253520,259120," or something like that uh right so it doesn't sound like something impossible to implement and see as"
259120,264080," well um right so we'll see how it goes we're going to start with some simple stuff right so we're going"
264080,268560," to start with some simple stuff and uh what i'm going to be using it for i'm going to be using it in"
268560,276080," my next video about the turing machine language right so tula uh this one uh it's it's actually better"
276080,281360," you're not supposed to see better right so there's a public page in here with a readme which explains"
281360,287200," how the language works and stuff like that so and the idea that i have specifically for that video is"
287200,293120," is not going to be that it's fully animated videos right so essentially i'm going to have animated"
293120,298400," interjections right so when i'm about to explain some sort of a concept uh it's going to switch to a"
298400,305360," different kind of scene where i have animations which kind of like supplement my like voice over"
305360,311120," explanations and stuff like that but the majority of the sort of the idea is going to be conveyed"
311120,316240," my usual sodium style where i talk and code simultaneously you know the usual thing that"
316240,321680," i do in the stream right so this is like the focal point of the of the content but sometimes they're"
321680,326880," going to be like animation interjection right so to explain some sort of a concept right so for example"
326880,331120," um like i want to explain the concept of a turing machine so i'm going to go into the scene where"
331120,336880," there's only animation and there's a tuning machine which visualizes the the tape the head and stuff like"
336880,342560," that uh right so and then once that out of the way we go back and we start coding we code for a little"
342560,348080," bit then another concept that needs explanation animation pop-up and just like stuff like that you"
348080,353360," know what i'm talking about right so and then maybe it will make more sense when i actually develop"
353360,358880," that right so but we'll see we'll see sounds like a python or lower bindings for such kind of library is"
358880,365920," kind of useful probably but they're useful for their ability to hot reload you can hot reload c as well"
365920,372240," right the only reason why you want to use scripting languages like python and lure is for hot reloading"
372240,378000," you can hot reload c as well i implemented that in mutualizer uh right i'm not really claiming that using"
378000,383840," c for this kind of stuff is better or worse not making any claims i'm just saying that it is possible"
383840,390320," and i think here i can conduct some sort of an experiment to see uh right to see if if it is"
390320,397200," like you know at least convenient lukewarm reload yeah so the idea is that you basically put all of your"
397200,404320," logic into dll right so you recompile dll and you ask the main event loop to just reload that dll and that's it"
404320,409520," essentially uh and it's pretty much as convenient as using dynamic languages honestly because i use"
409520,414880," that in visualizer and uh i used it a lot for developing ui and stuff like that and it was actually"
414880,420160," extremely convenient like i would not be able to develop the ui of visualizer without hot reloading"
420160,425840," right that was an essential feature to uh to develop the ui uh right and we're definitely gonna have"
425840,431360," something like that in here too uh and honestly to be fair i'm not a really big fan of dynamic"
431360,437280," languages i like statically typed compiled languages all right so for their ability to check some things"
437280,444000," uh right so i don't really want to use law don't really want to use law people love law uh right so"
444000,448160," probably because of its syntax i'm that kind of person that doesn't really care that much about the"
448160,454800," syntax i really care more about the semantics of the language um right so and we'll see we'll see"
456000,461760," anyways let's go into the panium uh right so i'm gonna start with maybe creating some sort of a hello"
461760,471760," world how about that how about that uh so let's go minor friend let's go we're going on to an adventure"
471760,479280," let's go i can't even spell world anymore i haven't programmed in c for a while so we probably need some"
479280,483520," sort of like a knob thing right so we need a knob situation in here so let's actually bring the knob"
483520,494160," bring the knob bring the knob so this is the knob.h and there we go so this one is main uh right so i"
494160,498480," think i'm going to call still call it main because it's going to be the executable right because the"
498480,503280," actual engine is going to be sort of like a library right so that that kind of makes sense to me so we're"
503280,511920," going to have knob.c and let's just include uh node.h right so and obviously it's a header only library"
511920,519920," uh so we have to do knob implementation implementation uh all right so we have to define this entire thing"
519920,526240," and we are going to why emacs why are you highlighting this please do not highlight that so we need to"
526240,533120," actually accept the argument so we can enable go rebuild yourself technology from knob uh right go where"
533120,539600," is it go rebuild yourself right the famous go rebuild yourself technology it automatically detects that"
539600,547600," the knob executable needs to be rebuilt uh right so and that's about it um all right so we need to create"
547600,557440," maybe cmd knob cmd right so we're going to have in here knob cmd append cmd so we're going to have just a"
557440,563920," compiler within the compiler within the compiler we're going to just do main like so and we're going to supply"
563920,571920," this thing as an input so that should be enough for now but maybe right away i want to enable all the warnings"
571920,577920," and maybe some extra warnings so for some extra spiciness uh with the compiler uh you know checking"
577920,583680," you know what i'm talking about right knob cmd run synchronously right we're going to run this entire"
583680,589440," thing synchronously and if it fails we're going to return on zero exit code there we go so that's pretty"
589440,598800," much it so let's go ahead and just do cc knob knob.c right let's go and it cannot find knob.h which is"
598800,604720," kind of bizarre to me is that because i uh yeah okay so that that makes sense right apparently there is a"
604720,610720," a semantical difference between the triangular brackets right so uh so i suppose the the quotes"
610720,616960," are searched within the current folder um all right so what we have in here cmd it's actually nob cmd"
616960,622000," excuse me right so this one you don't have to pass it by a point i don't remember how to program and see"
622000,626880," and there we go so we built the builder and now we can run the builder and it built the main application"
626880,633520," and for run the main application it says hello for it right that's what's happening in here that's what's"
633520,638960," happening here can your gct borrow check i don't think so do you don't need borrow checker honestly"
638960,651600," just use your brain uh finally language that we can read yeah exactly exactly exactly exactly uh so we've"
651600,657200," got some subs by the way all right so let's actually acknowledge the subs um thank you so much evil ever"
657200,662800," marco ever marker thank you so much we do try and with a message i forgot to make tea that's all right so the"
662800,668000," what's going to be available so you'll always be able to then later uh you know rewind back and watch"
668000,671840," again uh sin tools thank you so much for twitch prime thank you thank you thank you really appreciate"
671840,678400," that uh manim pog yeah so but this this is going to be called panium right so because manium is a"
678400,682640," mathematical animation engine and this is the programming animation engine so my name is"
682640,688480," specifically designed for math this one is designed for programming probably not that much different"
688480,693600," but you you you get the point you get the point you get the point uh anyways so let's actually bring the"
693600,700800," freaking ray lib in here let's bring the ray lib into the equation uh let's go to the ray san um you know"
700800,708480," repo and download some trashy uh programming is math with extra steps yeah suppose it's a discrete math it's"
708480,718000," applied discrete math um astrobo thank you so much for tier one uh so let's go and just grab some of this"
718000,730480," stuff uh linux amd64 uh copy the address and we're gonna just go here w get boom all right it's downloading"
730480,737680," it downloaded cool so let's unpack this thing and within in here we have everything we need right so"
737680,742160," essentially we'll probably so since i'm going to be hot reloading i'm pretty sure i'm going to be"
742160,747680," essentially linking with the dynamic library right so that makes sense so we're not going to be doing"
747680,753120," the static thing in here on the dynamic uh and for the includes in here so this is basically what we have"
753120,759760," okay so let's create a window uh i'm going to include the ray lib as usual and uh we're going to"
759760,769600," init the window right so it's going to be in 60 uh panim right so then while uh window should close"
769600,776320," window should close while it should not close we're going to be doing the usual thing uh begin drawing"
776320,781680," so i'm doing a ray leap speed run by the way yet again every time i'm programming in c i'm doing"
781680,791680," ray leap speed run clear background um background red and in here uh we have to do close the window"
791680,796880," right we're closing the window so if we try to just build this entire thing as it is it's not going"
796880,802320," to work because it can't find ray leap which is fine that is fine everyone that is totally fine"
802320,807360," there's nothing to worry about in here we're going to add this thing soon don't even worry about that"
807360,813280," chat don't even worry about that so we're going to go in here we're going to just find the in uh"
813280,818960," include folder and we're going to grab the path to the include folder and uh just copy paste it in there"
818960,823760," it's that freaking simple you see there was nothing to worry about there's nothing to worry about it's"
823760,829520," already here uh all right so what else do we have in here so now we have to you know link with all that"
829520,835360," stuff um so essentially i have to repeat this entire thing but for the library so this is going to be just"
835360,845840," lib and i wonder if you can just say l right but then specify only lib ray lib dot so right and i don't"
845840,849840," know if i have to do like a position independent thing or not position independent thing we'll see we'll"
849840,855200," see uh right so let's try to rebuild this entire stuff and it seems to be like it's yeah it actually"
855200,863760," linked compiled and stuff like that if i take a look at ldd in here uh yep you you can't easily do that"
863760,871600," right so it cannot find it i think there is a concept of our path do you guys know about it it's"
871600,879440," like our path uh come on you can do that so essentially it kind of breaks the path to the deal"
879440,885680," like to the dll's into the executable so you don't have to specify it um right it's a disaster yeah it's"
885680,891040," absolutely disaster but i mean we're developing a thing that is not supposed to be shipped to the end"
891040,896160," non-technical user you we're developing a thing that is going to be used by a technical user who knows"
896160,901040," how to program and see and also knows how to make animations right basically i'm developing it for"
901040,908080," myself right uh i'm basically developing it for myself uh so yeah our path design uh designates the"
908080,913920," runtime search path had coded in an executable file or library dynamic link loaders uses our path to find"
913920,919840," required libraries yeah so we can use ld library pass yeah we can do that but it's not convenient and it"
919840,925760," increases the size of the command lines that i have to put in in there right so it's it's a little"
925760,931360," bit easier to use our path and this is exactly what i used in mutualizer believe it or not right this is"
931360,937680," precisely what i used in your usualizer if i go into the builder for linux i think i have yeah there we"
937680,944960," we go this is literally what i'm doing here look at that so i just pass a path to the linker our path"
944960,949440," and the path to all of the like where all these things are located especially in here look at that"
949440,955600," i'm passing the path to the ray leap uh so this is probably what we want in here honestly this is"
955600,962400," probably what we want so i'm going to go into the knob.c and we're yeah we're passing it to the main"
962400,970160," compilation thing so i'm going to like put it somewhere here uh knobcmd append cmd uh like so"
970160,978320," and it is going to be essentially yeah this is going to be essentially in here like so uh all right so"
978320,984320," now let's try to rerun this entire thing and if i take a look at the final executable as you can see"
984320,991440," uh it it found it right so it now points precisely at that entire thing i don't have to use ld library path"
991440,996640," and again i'm not going to be shipping that executable to end user and non-technical user"
996640,1003040," like these kind of executables are just for your computer right the sort of like the end product"
1003040,1008480," is going to be a library with which you're sort of linking right not the executable executable is your"
1008480,1016960," own custom thing uh right essentially that's the idea at least if i try to run main now as you can see"
1016960,1022720," it's working so we can even check what what would have happened without our path right so we can we"
1022720,1027120," can check what's going to happen uh right so we're going to restart it then we're going to try to run"
1027120,1032080," main as you can see it cannot load the radio but it literally cannot find it cannot open shared"
1032080,1038080," object no such file or directory so that our path is important right so if you never heard about our path"
1038080,1045600," so now you know have you tried skier before i heard i've heard that word before i have no idea what it"
1045600,1053600," is honestly i've heard it on i think on twitter and i think i've seen some projects using skier is this"
1053600,1060160," some sort of like a ui framework is that what it is like i don't know what it is um so ski is famously"
1060160,1065600," difficult to build from source why would it using them right why would i use it then if it's difficult"
1065600,1074480," to to build like it's like an opposite of what i stand for um so google2d rendering engine ski equals"
1074480,1084080," the chrome renderer ah ah i think i saw that in when i was trying to build obs because obs uses skier for"
1084080,1091680," like browser support or whatever the fuck it is i don't really know um every google project is"
1091680,1096400," famously difficult to build from source yeah and i'm pretty sure they're freaking doing that intentionally"
1096400,1103360," right so so essentially this is like an open source but it's not open source you can't build it you have"
1103360,1109280," the source code but you can't can build it it's it's kind of genius actually go is kind of a different"
1109280,1116560," story it feels like go was developed by a completely isolated department of google somehow that has"
1116560,1121920," nothing to do with the google itself because like it feels like the usual google shittiness is not"
1121920,1128080," enforced on go specifically right maybe because they care about this language too much i don't know maybe"
1128080,1133680," maybe because uh you know rob pike and ken thompson work on this language and if you start in like"
1133680,1137920," enforcing google shittiness on that department both of these people will instantly live"
1138880,1144080," right i can see that this is probably the only reason why they don't enforce the google shittiness on"
1144080,1152160," that department so yeah um but the everything else is just like yeah you can feel the google shittiness in"
1152160,1157520," there um the plan nine energy here"
1157520,1168480," so anyway um yes yes yes now i know this skier now i care about it even less thank"
1168480,1172960," you so much for telling me what it is uh i like didn't care about it before because i didn't"
1172960,1179680," know what it is now i i know what it is and now i don't care about it even more thank you so much so"
1179680,1182080," very cool"
1182080,1192000," so what we need to do in here what we need to do we need to actually separate our logic into"
1192000,1197920," like a plugin similar to mutualizer and stuff like that right so in the mutualizer we have"
1197920,1208320," yeah we literally have a plugin so let's actually go there uh src src so plug dot h uh yeah there we go"
1208320,1215760," so we even use x macros in here look at that we're being fancy and shit so essentially um it denotes like a"
1215760,1224000," bunch of um methods that are going to be exported by um by the dll of the plug right so they're going"
1224000,1231040," to be accepted by the dll of the plug to be fair okay here's the thing the only reason why i use the x"
1231040,1240960," macro in here uh is because i needed to switch between the modes of uh between the modes of static linking and"
1240960,1248880," dynamic linking right so what i'm thinking is that in this particular specific framework i'm only going"
1248880,1255200," to be linking dynamically because i need all like hot reloading right so i don't need static linking in"
1255200,1261120," here because of that i don't really need all of that stuff in here right i don't need to sort of abstract"
1261120,1266480," away how exactly those functions are sort of processed right so whether they're going to be statically"
1266480,1270880," linked or dynamically linked and stuff like that so it literally doesn't matter it literally"
1270880,1279520," doesn't matter for me so um yeah let's see how we can even approach this entire stuff um so i'm going"
1279520,1285120," to create the plug dot h and this is where we're going to have an interface uh right so this is the"
1285120,1291280," idea oh i can't do that so let's put inclusion guard if not def plug dot h we're going to define"
1291280,1296960," this entire thing i'm going to do and if like so so what we what kind of things we need in here we"
1296960,1302720," need a thing that initializes the plug right we need the thing that initializes the plug so let me open"
1302720,1308160," the visualizer one and see what kind of stuff we have in here so we have pre-reload post-reload right"
1308160,1314560," so i didn't really know if i really need them that much but maybe i do need them a little bit maybe i do"
1314560,1323040," need them a little bit uh so this one is really rather interesting so usually plugging the dll plugin"
1323920,1331040," uh allocates a little bit of memory uh to sort of keep its state right it allocates a little bit of"
1331040,1338880," memory to keep its state uh right before reloading the plugin the plugin has an opportunity to return"
1338880,1346320," to the pointer to the pointer to its state so then it can be carried over to the new version of the plugin"
1346320,1355120," in here like so right so you see what's going on here all right when you do plug in it the plugin"
1355120,1362240," the dll will allocate a chunk of code where it's going to store its entire state when you are about to"
1362240,1367440," reload the thing we're going to be calling this thing to the plugin notifying it i'm about to reload you"
1367440,1372000," this thing will be so fucking scared of being reloaded it will return you the pointer to the"
1372000,1378080," state it's allocated you're supposed to save that thing then you kill that fucking dll right while"
1378080,1384640," preserving its state while preserving its state that it allocated you load a new dll and you pass"
1384640,1391680," that old state the state of the old dll to the new one so that's how we preserve the state of that dll"
1392720,1397520," right and it actually works in mutualize it works so the only way it's not going to work is when the"
1397520,1404480," schema of the state changes right but it's actually kind of a rare occasion uh right so if the scheme"
1404480,1408800," of the data changes that means you're making like very much radical changes and you probably want to"
1408800,1415680," reload the entire thing anyway uh right so usually it's fine when you're just modifying some colors right"
1415680,1420960," so quite often i need hot reloading to like tweak some little small things without resetting the"
1420960,1426720," entire state and in that case the schema of the of the state of the plugin doesn't really change at all"
1426720,1431840," only some constants change so in that case it's totally fine uh you see what i'm talking about right"
1431840,1437680," so it's actually kind of cool uh so we do need this kind of thing i think right so pre-reload post-reload"
1437680,1444640," and it carries the state uh between the the dll's and stuff like that uh is it possible to detect the"
1444640,1449200," state of course it is possible you just have to put a little bit more effort into how you organize the"
1449200,1456240," hot reloading right so the more effort you put the cooler it may become right so maybe uh along with"
1456240,1463200," some you know state we can also keep track of the version of the state right so and then the post-reload"
1463200,1470640," can detect that the state is of previous version in it can apply migrations right similar to sql"
1470640,1478240," migrations but to the state in the memory why not right we can just like use the the same trick that"
1478240,1483200," databases uses people who like develop databases and stuff like that so we can do something like that"
1483200,1487920," uh right i was actually theorizing on how to do that i never implemented that uh it will be kind of"
1487920,1491840," interesting to do that but we're not going to be doing it in here because it's kind of an overkill for"
1491840,1497040," what we're doing here right again if the schema of the data changed too much you can just reload the"
1497040,1503120," entire thing anyway so you're doing something like radical at this point and you want to like restart"
1503120,1510720," anyway uh right you want to restart anyway um that's my how to say that rationale for for doing it the"
1510720,1516000," way i do so it's sort of like a you know trade-off like how much power you want to have um"
1520160,1523680," can you change the scheme as well by using the word magic yeah you can do pretty much anything"
1523680,1529040," um so anyway so we're not going to be doing that because it's like a lot of effort and we're not"
1529040,1535200," going to get that much of a benefit anyway uh right so we also have additional like in mutualize we have"
1535200,1539120," additional things for loading resources free resources i don't think we need it for now maybe"
1539120,1543680," in the future we're going to need that but not for now so plug up uh plug update is an interesting one"
1543680,1548880," it's the one that is going to be called on each frame and it's the one that basically renders the"
1548880,1555040," frame uh using raylib and stuff like that so this is the only things we need in here i think that's"
1555040,1560480," basically the only things we need in here and essentially what i want to do i want to define"
1560480,1566960," those things as variables right i want to define those things as variables and i think this is what"
1566960,1574880," i can do in here uh right so i'm going to say something like this and if i understand the syntax"
1574880,1582480," of c correctly if you do something like this this defines each individual function in here as a variable"
1582480,1587920," uh which contains a pointer to that function so then later you can do something like this if i'm not"
1587920,1593280," mistaken i keep forgetting the syntax of function pointers but i think that's basically how you do"
1593280,1598160," that right and essentially how we're going to be doing that we're going to be using dl open right"
1598160,1605440," i think ld open and ld find and whatever the fuck it is uh right to sort of populate these uh these"
1605440,1612800," things right so we're going to be dynamically loading it ourselves um okay so let me actually try to"
1612800,1618480," rebuild this entire thing maybe i'm going to actually go ahead and just include this entire"
1618480,1626400," stuff so this is going to be um plug dot h this is plug dot h and i just want to check for for sanity"
1626400,1633040," right so this compile correctly okay so it doesn't back come back correctly so if i remove this uh pointer"
1633040,1639920," there we go right so function is initialized like a variable there we go so this is a very interesting thing"
1639920,1646400," so this is a quirk of the of the syntax of c this is function declaration i already talked about it in"
1646400,1652880," one of my videos on youtube right so this is a function declaration this is a variable declaration"
1652880,1661360," this is a function this is a variable yeah and since it's a variable declaration it's a variable that"
1661360,1665920," contains a point to the function of this type you can initialize it with null like that"
1667360,1675120," don't freaking ask me why it's like it's it's just c it's just c right it's an old weird language it's a"
1675120,1681360," weird old language uh right so unfortunately we can i haven't come up with anything better but i mean"
1681360,1686800," it's kind of impossible at this point uh she has a stupidest syntax of a very well designed language"
1686800,1694800," yeah it's kind of bizarre honestly it's kind of bizarre so rust has unreadable syntax but it at least makes"
1694800,1702080," sense some of the syntax in c sometimes doesn't even make any sense right but this is a readable"
1702080,1706160," to some extent right unless you need to use c decal"
1706160,1716080," so and can i call the function with that point a variable you can try sure we can do plug in"
1716080,1722400," like so but it's going to suck fault at least right now right if we try to do that as you can see so i"
1722400,1727760," successfully called it and it's a completely valid thing to do because i have a like shed ton of"
1727760,1731760," warnings enabled right if i was doing something wrong i think compiler would have told me right"
1731760,1736320," away so that means i'm probably doing something right uh and then if you try to run this entire"
1736320,1742240," thing it's going to suck fault right because you're trying to call a function that points to null you you"
1742240,1746560," can't do that right so you can't do that we first thing we need to do we need to pre-populate uh all"
1746560,1751520," these functions in here how we're going to be preparing them we need to load the dll first of"
1751520,1757120," all we need to compile this plugin as a separate dll so let's actually quickly do that so we need to"
1757120,1763840," have a plug c uh right so and i'm going to include i think i'm not going to even include that stuff"
1763840,1770000," right so i need to just define all these functions in here and if i'm going to include this header that"
1770000,1773680," means they're going to actually collide with the function definition so i'm not going to include"
1773680,1779440," plug edge right so now we actually have to implement all these functions i wonder if you can use a little"
1779440,1785760," bit about emacs magic if you know what i'm talking about mine a friend just a tiny bit of emacs magic a"
1785760,1794880," boom look at that uh a boom that's not bad that's a pretty cool emacs magic not gonna lie so now i can do some"
1794880,1804080," shit like this yo look at that that is absolutely epic mind so in here i suppose to return like null"
1804080,1811920," uh and in here we just do state right and essentially like we can try to do this state thingy right away"
1811920,1817680," uh right and by the way i think this one has to be denoted denoted that it doesn't accept any parameters"
1817680,1825040," just in case uh right so here let's define like a structure which i'm going to call plug right so"
1825040,1829200," it's a state of the plugin so and in here what we're going to store i don't really know maybe we're not"
1829200,1833600," going to store anything but it would be nice to just have something because i think empty structs are not"
1833600,1840160," allowed per se uh we can store some color in here so we also probably want to include uh ray leap right so"
1840160,1846240," we're definitely going to be using ready so uh maybe background color right so this is a background color"
1846240,1853040," and in here we're going to also have a you know a static global variable that stores the point into"
1853040,1859680," that plug right so this is going to be something like initially it's no so our engine sort of speak"
1859680,1868000," is going to call uh plug init which will effectively allocate uh this entire thing so we're going to allocate"
1868000,1874560," size of plug maybe i'm going to even do something like this right so if i change the type of the plug i will"
1874560,1879840," i don't have to change anything in here so which is rather convenient and also let's assert that p is"
1879840,1888400," not equal to null right so this entire thing didn't fail okay so then when we are about to get unloaded"
1888400,1896400," we're going to return the state of our plugin and we when we just load it we're going to restore that state"
1896400,1903760," back that's it so that's about it so within the plug update we're going to be calling begin drawing uh"
1903760,1909520," right then end drawing and what we can do in here we can clear background and we can essentially use the"
1909520,1914480," i don't know that the background color in the states so who said we can't do that right so"
1914480,1918480," this is this basic like a plugin system this is a basic plugin system"
1920640,1926800," right so and i think we need to now build the plugin as a separate dll so let's actually see how"
1926800,1937440," we can do that um so can i um can i factor out this entire thing somehow can i factor out so let me see"
1937440,1945360," um build main right and since this thing kind of allocates the memory and i want to reuse the same"
1945360,1950160," cmd over and over again i think it makes sense for me to actually kind of accept this entire thing by a"
1950160,1955600," pointer all right and then here before try to use anything i'm going to just do count equal to zero"
1955600,1963920," uh right so let's go and just copy paste like move literally move this entire thing in here"
1963920,1971280," interestingly right so this thing may fail because of that maybe it makes sense to propagate the error a"
1971280,1979200," little bit up just propagate the error a little bit up like so uh and in here we can do some stuff if"
1979200,1990320," build main build main cmd if not build uh right so i'm going to just return one cool so we have a"
1990320,1995280," separate thing in here and obviously here we don't have to pass it by a pointer because it's already a"
1995280,1999680," pointer but here we have to actually kind of do references which is a little bit inconvenient but that's fine"
2000320,2004640," so what i want to have in here i want to have like a separate thing which is going to be build plug"
2004640,2012240," right so that's what we're going to have in here so it's going to be build plug uh knob knob cmd"
2012240,2019280," right so and we're going to clean up so it's kind of cool like when you're just writing like a simple"
2019280,2025280," hello world using knob doesn't make any sense and it feels like an overkill as soon as your program"
2025280,2029760," becomes more and more complicated it starts to make a lot of sense like it's actually kind of convenient to"
2029760,2036000," have like a proper language to build your project it's it's kind of insane right it's not obvious"
2036000,2040960," that this is what you want this is what you want and it's kind of like the point of jaya as well"
2040960,2045920," right so because in jaya you kind of do a similar thing right you're using the same language to build"
2045920,2052720," the project in that language right so you literally do this kind of stuff in jaya too uh right which is"
2052720,2062960," super cool anyways so we can even factor out some of this stuff uh right so i don't know we can basically"
2062960,2072880," have a function which is cc um right and it will just accept this entire stuff like so and we can move"
2073440,2078640," all of the common things in here all of the common things in here to that function right so essentially"
2078640,2085440," like this so this is going to be cc cmd right so and i know and i know that this is kind of stuff"
2085440,2091040," i want like everywhere right so for all of my commands like let's just put it in here so that makes sense"
2091040,2096000," uh right so and then i can do something like this right so it's like a common place where i can"
2096000,2109120," modify all that stuff uh all right so um and in here what am i doing is probably uh i'm wanna build this"
2109120,2116000," entire thing as a library but i'm not really sure how to do that i think i uh did that in visualizer let"
2116000,2123520," me just check how i did that in visualizer so plug dot so right when i'm building this thing i'm just like"
2123520,2130640," directly saying oh uh plugged it to so and i also add these kind of flags right so i say uh generate"
2130640,2136400," position independent code and make the library shared uh right so this actually makes sense maybe i'm i"
2136400,2143040," want to like basically yoink these two things in here and put them somewhere here that makes a lot of sense"
2143040,2150240," to me um all right so this is going to be shared this is going to be libplug.so and also we need to do"
2150240,2155440," something else honestly so this one is nothing uh also we need to do something else"
2155440,2163840," so yeah we're linking with the usual thing plus we're linking with lm ld and so on and so forth"
2163840,2169520," but in the main file and i remember do we do we link with anything yeah we actually kind of do so that's"
2169520,2179680," fine anyways um so let's just copy paste this entire stuff and maybe uh factoring that stuff out would be"
2179680,2190560," actually also a good idea right so maybe it was going to be like libs noob cmd cmd yeah that's a very"
2190560,2196800," cool idea maybe it's gonna bite me in the ass in the future but that's fine i'm kind of got used to that"
2196800,2207600," i even kind of enjoy that look at everything was said so right so what do we have in here uh we're"
2207600,2220160," gonna do libs cmd uh right so yeah so it's sort of like a prelude and basically possibly what's the"
2220160,2225280," opposite of prelude what's the opposite of prelude i don't really know i don't remember chat i don't speak"
2225280,2231360," english can some english speakers help me in the chat right so you have a prelude uh epilogue"
2231360,2236960," epilogue yeah thank you so much right so this is sort of like a prelude and this is the epilogue"
2236960,2242080," uh right thank you it's pretty cool uh and between them you have like this custom stuff"
2242080,2250720," like so make a lot of sense uh by the way maybe it also makes sense for me to put ggdb to add debug"
2250720,2256160," information and stuff uh right so anyways let's go ahead and just run this entire thing and see"
2256160,2263520," how it fails it failed fucking miserably fucking miserably mate absolutely fucking miserably because"
2263520,2270000," i never really called any in like anything in here right so i forgot to like literally put this stuff in"
2270000,2277120," here okay so let's go ahead and do that and that worked that that work that work mate"
2277120,2284800," easy peasy lemon fucking squeezy so we have a you know lip uh lip plug we have main that knows nothing"
2284800,2288640," about it so now we have to kind of load this entire thing uh right"
2290240,2296080," so uh hi ternin could you please explain what cmd append and how it works we can take a look at the"
2296080,2303120," source code right so as i always say the best documentation is the source code let's take a"
2303120,2311680," fucking look at it okay so where is it defined it's defined in knob.h cmd append right nope cmd append so"
2311680,2315200," how does it work uh so yeah"
2315200,2322400," what the focus do be saying like source code is the best documentation and then pull up this"
2322400,2322720," shit"
2322720,2336560," well i mean i fully understand this code by the way but it's just so fucking funny"
2338960,2348800," uh anyways like again i fully understand this code it's just like i'm thinking how i'm going to be"
2348800,2356480," explaining all that stuff uh so essentially uh what do we have in here so this entire thing obviously"
2356480,2362720," accepts cmd and variadic amount of arguments like essentially you can put whatever amount of arguments"
2362720,2368560," you want in here uh it will all accept it and it will substitute all of these arguments in here"
2368960,2375440," right it will substitute all of them in here like so so we actually use this uh you know variadic"
2375440,2381200," argument in two places which is kind of sus but i mean that's probably fine so anyway let's take a"
2381200,2387280," look at each individual argument so we're internally in noob cmd append we're calling noob da"
2387280,2395360," append many with actually three arguments these are three very chunky arguments right so that's what they are"
2396320,2403120," okay so uh the first argument is you know pretty understandable so this is essentially this thing"
2403120,2412000," we just forward this in test step then here's an interesting thing we are constructing an array of strings"
2412000,2420480," so this is a c string and that says it's a array of c strings right and this is a syntax where you just"
2420480,2430240," construct such array in place right so essentially if you have something like this full uh bar buzz and"
2430240,2436400," so on and so forth it constructs an array of strings in place as a literal it's a special sort of like a"
2436400,2445600," syntax of that so since vi args like expanded to the arguments that you put after cmd it will construct an"
2445600,2452960," array of strings out of those arguments like this and would pass it as a second argument so that's what"
2452960,2460560," it will do all right so and what is this monstrosity if you look carefully at this monstrosity you will"
2460560,2469520," notice that this thing is actually part of the second monstrosity right you may notice that so what we're"
2469520,2477760," doing we're here taking the size of this array in bytes we're taking the size of this array in bytes"
2477760,2486960," then we divide by the size of the string effectively this entire monstrosity simply computes the amount"
2486960,2494400," of arguments in this monstrosity that's everything there is to it right so essentially this thing forwards"
2494400,2501840," that cmd then takes all of the arguments that you put in here which are strings constructs an array out of them"
2501840,2507920," and passes that array in there and then computes the size of that array and passes that as a third argument"
2507920,2514880," so the structure they think where you want to add those things the array of the things that you want to add"
2514880,2516880," and the amount of enemies that you want to add"
2516880,2526000," so again the source code is the best documentation you just have to calm down take a deep breath"
2526000,2528320," and carefully analyze what you're looking at"
2528320,2534560," never get scared by the code remember code is scared of you more than you scared of code"
2534560,2540480," just split it into parts and analyze each individual part and it will make sense"
2542000,2548480," okay so we understand what this code does so we can now go and see what the irpen does"
2548480,2563440," right so what the irpen does uh right so let me see so where is the implementation okay"
2569280,2578880," anyway so essentially in uh in my code like uh there is a notion of dynamic array right there is a notion"
2578880,2586640," of dynamic array uh and dynamic array is any structure like literally any structure that has three fields"
2586640,2592960," right so we're gonna call da da stands for a dynamic array so uh essentially the first field is items the"
2592960,2599280," second field is count uh right which is usually size team which is usually size t and the second one is"
2599280,2608320," capacity so essentially um items points at the beginning of the data of the array so this is where"
2608320,2614240," all of the elements are located count is how many elements you have in that array and capacity how many"
2614240,2620240," elements you actually allocated with the real log right actually allocated where they look capacity can be"
2620240,2625280," bigger than count because we usually pre-allocate to more things than we actually use in count"
2625280,2633280," so uh with this macro we sort of abstracting away from the types of items right so we are simply"
2633280,2638560," abstracting away so essentially what this macro does it takes dynamic array which is a structure that has"
2638560,2646240," at least these three fields and it appends all of these elements into that dynamic array and like with this"
2646240,2650240," amount of elements right so this is the pointer to the elements this is how many elements you want to"
2650240,2656960," append and it just appends all these things into this structure also allocating enough capacity if the"
2656960,2663280," dynamic array is not big enough to fit all of that stuff in there that's what it is that's what it is"
2663280,2673360," so what that means uh knob cmd appends uh a few elements let's actually take a look at this kind of"
2673360,2681040," thing so knob append okay so this is apparently a dynamic array so knob cmd is a dynamic array and we're"
2681040,2686320," appending a bunch of things a bunch of strings into that dynamic array so that means cmd is a dynamic"
2686320,2692480," array of strings we can take a look at the definition of knob cmd knob cmd there we go and it is a dynamic"
2692480,2697040," array of string look at that it's it's literally that it has items it has count it has capacity and so on and so"
2697040,2703600," forth so it's a dynamic array of strings and we're appending strings into that dynamic array"
2703600,2712640," so then we have functions knob cmd run synchronously which accepts that dynamic array of strings and"
2712640,2718480," literally creates a child process that executes that command so what this entire thing does it simply"
2718480,2729840," constructs a command line in c that's it that's it that's it that's fucking simple does it make sense now"
2729840,2735840," does it make sense so it's kind of equivalent to command and rust if you ever programmed with rust rust rust rust up doc"
2736560,2746880," uh dog path oh my god path uh like this i did some fucking working now i don't have a rust up in here"
2746880,2755600," okay so rust api command right so there's a special structure yeah there we go in the process"
2755600,2762000," um in a process package which is command and as you can see here you construct a command line and you just"
2762000,2767120," run it so this is basically that but implemented in c that's it"
2767120,2780880," simple easy peasy let me squeeze anyway so yeah and i'm just using c as a bash right i'm just using c as"
2780880,2788720," bash uh okay so what we're doing in here we're just building all of that stuff so okay uh enough of the talk"
2788720,2795120," and after the talk and let's go ahead and continue the development continue the development so i'm"
2795120,2799200," going to try to rebuild this and i think okay so i didn't break anything within node.h which is good"
2799200,2807760," which is good so we have a leap plug and uh now we need to try to load it up how we're going to be"
2807760,2813920," loading that loading it up i think we're going to be loading it with ld goddamn man doesn't work what the"
2813920,2823040," fuck bruv okay it works here ld open is it ld open uh dl open yeah this is what we need so it allows us"
2823040,2829280," to actually load the dynamic library right so we probably need to first include this special thing"
2829280,2836400," with the name duke right so that's that's a very common name in postex it's a very famous duke"
2838240,2848080," function uh actually library so let's include that um c development be like uh and let's just try to"
2848080,2854800," load this entire thing right let's just try to load so we're going to be loading it from i think we're"
2854800,2859200," going to assume that we loading it from the current folder right so i think we will have to update our"
2859200,2863920," path uh because otherwise it won't be able to find it but we'll see so we're going to solve problem as we"
2863920,2869200," encounter them right so in here so what about the flags what kind of flags we're supposed to use in"
2869200,2876800," here i think uh let me just search for them uh rtl lazy so that means it's not going to load the symbols"
2876800,2882800," unless we try to use them i think we need to do rtld now right so we're gonna load everything right away"
2882800,2890880," so when in here we basically just loaded the handle right so and as far as i know uh if this entire thing"
2890880,2896960," return null that means we didn't manage to load it at all right we didn't manage to load it at all but"
2896960,2903280," don't quite remember so let me actually see return so on success it returns blah blah blah errors from"
2903280,2910800," these functions can be so uh returns on success deal calls return zero on error it returns non-zero value"
2910800,2919520," oh it's the deal close deal open returns non-null on error um returns no errors from these functions can be"
2919520,2926880," diagnosed with dl error okay that's actually cool so we're going to do something like um so const char"
2926880,2935280," lib uh plug path lib plug path and we're going to do something like this lib plug path there we go"
2935280,2944400," uh right so it allows us to do something like uh error could not load s because of s"
2945120,2953840," right so and we couldn't open lib plug path and can we use dl error to actually get the description of"
2953840,2962320," what the has happened the error uh let me see oh it literally returns a string what the what the"
2962320,2970080," a convenient error reporting and see what the hell is going on all right please give me that thank you"
2970640,2975520," that's very cool uh okay so let's actually try to rebuild this in test stuff does it compile it"
2975520,2979840," doesn't compile because we've got semicolon that's fine let's try to run this into anything and could"
2979840,2984000," not load lab lib plug as so lib plug so cannot open"
2984000,2996800," could not load lib plug so lib plug so cannot open shared object file no such file or"
2996800,3008480," let's a little bit redundant um okay so i suppose they already include all like all of the necessary"
3008480,3014640," information that i want to report here anyway uh all right so uh let me let me go ahead and maybe"
3014640,3020320," remove some of that stuff right so some of the stuff is kind of redundant if you know what i mean it's"
3020320,3026080," kind of redundant uh right so maybe i'm gonna even do something like knob and then man look at that so"
3026080,3031120," it can upload this entire stuff right because it can't find that i wonder if you can just like directly"
3031120,3037600," say load this thing uh will it work it worked right so but it couldn't we can actually like"
3037600,3044240," directly try to load this thing up um right or we can modify our path right so essentially one of the"
3044240,3050240," things we can say just add another our path to the executable um right so"
3052640,3059440," so we already said use this our path and the second thing we can say use uh you know this our path right"
3059440,3064960," so we can always say that and that works as well right so now our path automatically tries to search"
3064960,3070880," within the current folder and it works it does in fact work it does in fact work so the next thing we"
3070880,3077280," want to do we want to actually kind of load up all of the functions all of these functions that we listed in"
3077280,3086480," here right so plug in it preload post reload update and so on and so forth we can do that we can do that"
3086480,3092640," by using i think dl sim or something like that let me actually find that i think it's called dl sim"
3092640,3102000," yeah there we go so you supposed to provide the handle version oh it's a dlb sim okay so we only need this"
3102000,3106800," one so provide the handle that you loaded with dl open and you provide the name of the symbol"
3106800,3112080," you provide the name of the symbol very easy okay so uh let me let me see"
3112080,3122960," so now we're gonna do dl sim uh lib plug and the first thing we want to actually load the plug init"
3122960,3130880," right so and we're gonna assign it to plug init which is the variable that we defined in plug.h this one"
3130880,3136160," so we automatically assigning this entire thing right so we probably also want to check"
3136720,3143920," that this thing is actually not equal null right so because i think i think it may be equal to null"
3143920,3148720," right let me see so when if we return on success this function return address associated with this"
3148720,3153040," symbol on failure returns null and you have to use dl error blah blah blah blah blah blah okay that's cool"
3153040,3160720," so uh let's do the following thing um right so we reload this in depth stuff you can actually just like use the"
3160720,3168240," the same code here over and over again right so and then here plug init so this one is going to be pre-reload"
3168240,3180320," okay so here we're going to have post reload and here we're going to have updates let's go okay that's pretty"
3180320,3187440," cool uh and let's try to rebuild this entire stuff so the cool thing is that probably what we can do"
3187440,3197200," is maybe say something right so essentially we just successfully loaded lib plug and all the functions"
3197200,3203120," and stuff like that so essentially what we need to do we need to do plug init which will automatically"
3203120,3208400," initialize the plugin and allocate the memory and stuff like that uh and maybe somewhere in the"
3208400,3216480," plug.c we can say um something like trace log right so if i remember correctly so somewhere in raylib"
3216480,3220240," let me take a look at the includes let me take a look at this kind of stuff trace log"
3220880,3227280," is this how we do that where is the trace log yeah there we go so and yeah we have to provide the trace"
3227280,3234560," in four i think is it in four i don't freaking remember i think it's a log in four yeah it's a log in four"
3234560,3245600," i'm gonna say um initialized initialized plugin there we go so if we try to now run this entire thing it's"
3245600,3254320," sec faulted me how did that happen that is not supposed to happen interestingly if i try to do that"
3256640,3262080," it actually worked fine what the is that because of this thing bruh"
3262080,3265920," if equal no"
3265920,3273360," yeah that is true it is if it's equal to no yeah"
3273360,3279520," true that is totally true undefined symbol plugin it okay that's cool"
3281680,3286880," and defined symbol plugin it which is kind of weird um let me actually see so if you take a"
3286880,3293840," look at the external symbols there is no external symbols in here i think yeah i suppose one of the"
3293840,3298560," things we have to do in here all right so when we're compiling this entire stuff we have to explicitly say"
3298560,3305360," that those things are going to be external i think right if i'm not mistaken uh let's do something like"
3305360,3310880," that i don't remember like explicitly marking them on external but maybe this is something that we have to do"
3311680,3313680," no not reading hmm"
3313680,3321120," so that's kind of bizarre uh all right let me see yeah and it still doesn't contain the symbols"
3321120,3322960," absolutely"
3322960,3328640," bizarre all right let's go to visualizer let's actually go to visualizer and see what do we"
3328640,3333200," have in there right so if we take a look at that kind of stuff uh right for instance in visualizer"
3333200,3339440," i never had to do this kind of things so i wonder how exactly do i handle that when i for instance"
3339440,3346560," compiling those things uh right so we're gonna do knob linux do i do anything special about them"
3346560,3356480," um where is the compilation uh right so when i do plug so i just do i also link with all these things"
3356480,3365520," like lm ld lp thread or something like that but doesn't really make any freaking sense bro uh doesn't"
3365520,3377120," really make any freaking sense okay um so plug dot c this is this is a wrong plug actually uh-huh"
3377120,3383520," maybe i just named them incorrectly i don't think so like it doesn't really export them it doesn't really"
3383520,3394240," export them um so let me take a look at knob dot c knob dot c so int build plug this is just shared"
3394240,3404480," there's something man i don't know i don't know attribute visibility i never used attribute visibility in"
3404480,3412720," mutualizer right uh right so i never had to use it so that means um there's something else wrong in"
3412720,3417600," here which i don't really understand because we can even take a look right so here is this here's"
3417600,3424480," the symbol so there's no plugin here but in mutualizer if i'm not mistaken right if in mutualizer"
3424480,3430080," if i take a look at this thing it does contain like everything that you probably need in here right so"
3430080,3435920," plug in it and so on and so forth so there's something bizarre in here and i'm not really sure"
3435920,3442720," what exactly right so let me take a look at maybe config in here so uh we do enable hot reloading okay"
3442720,3448880," so let's actually try to run knob and take a look at the command lines that we're calling here for all of"
3448880,3458320," these things um yeah so everything seems to be fine uh the only thing we don't do in our application is we"
3458320,3465280," link with lm dl and p thread but i feel like we like at least it did never complain about it right"
3465280,3470240," it never complained explicitly that you need these kind of things so i'm not really sure we can just go"
3470240,3476000," ahead and add them right so it would be kind of weird that this is sort of like something implicitly that"
3476000,3480240," that you have to add otherwise it's gonna silently break right i really don't like this kind of"
3480240,3486240," situations but i mean it could be one of those situations who knows um right you never know"
3486240,3495840," so all right okay that's kind of it's kind of weird it's kind of bizarre i would even say uh okay"
3495840,3506560," so and that's no that is bizarre uh pyc maybe i'm a bit too late but i never have to add it to mutualizer"
3506560,3515760," right so in mutualizer i let's let's try to run it one one more time f pyc pyc no no no no so here i'm"
3515760,3522240," adding this entire thing and i add this that thing in there okay the only difference by the way we have in"
3522240,3532000," here is that we compiling leap uh like libra leap ourselves right so we're compiling it ourselves"
3532000,3534320," is that the only reason"
3534320,3541920," is that the amazing missing c file you think i'm missing c file could be it could be something as"
3541920,3550480," dumb as dumb as that it is why why does it allow me to compile it freaking c oh my god"
3556400,3565040," why this language is still a thing can anybody tell me freaking stupid ass c i swear to god anyway"
3565040,3576320," all right so we also have assert thank you thank you so much uh asserts let's go uh okay so that seems"
3576320,3582000," to be fine if i take a look at the symbols here they are here are my beautiful beautiful symbols it even"
3582000,3588880," has p beautiful all right so take a look at this stuff so i said well i mean static so it's probably"
3588880,3599680," probably not visible uh right uh let's actually try to run it okay so if i uh like plugin uh or maybe"
3599680,3606720," initialize what was it what was it called i forgot plug c ah we actually removed the the login in here okay"
3606720,3612560," okay okay might as well actually by the way do something like this so we can instantly see"
3612560,3619760," uh right that we initialized the plugin we initialized the plugin so and in here what we can do right we"
3619760,3624560," can enable this entire thing right so i wonder what exactly we want to do here do we want to initialize"
3624560,3629360," it after we loaded the window maybe maybe that makes a little bit more sense and by the way here we probably"
3629360,3643600," have to call plug update plug update update update that works and it says initialize plugin which was"
3643600,3651600," printed in the separate dll right so it's kind of doing some weird shits right because um it's using the"
3651600,3659200," background from here but we never initialized this thing properly at all or whatsoever maybe this is"
3659200,3666480," something that we have to do so we can do mem set p zero size of p and let's go so it's going to be zero"
3666480,3672880," initialized so after that i suppose maybe we can do background is going to be green right so we can"
3672880,3678000," explicitly initialize this in desktop and it is green as you can see so it complains a couple of things"
3678000,3685200," because it's mem set so we're supposed to maybe put a string in there that's fine uh let's go so cool"
3685200,3691920," we have a logic in a separate dll we have an event loop in a main program so now we need to learn how"
3691920,3697280," to hot reload this entire thing right so we need to how to reload this entire thing so thank you so much"
3697280,3702000," for the beats tcp stream uh so i think i didn't acknowledge some of the subs i really apologize for"
3702000,3707920," that i was slapping the code like crazy uh so i think i already acknowledged synthos i think you"
3707920,3714000," so much astro bot uh rinka koi coder thank you so much for the one with the message ah yes ray deep"
3714000,3718720," highly cultured stream yeah it is highly cultured stream that is true journey the rest thank you so"
3718720,3725600," much uh for twitch prime with the message dude this would be nice to see pre-processed probably maybe"
3725600,3730720," we'll see we'll see so faced plasma rifle thank you so much for tier one and cp stream thank you so much"
3730720,3737840," for 100 bitcoins thank you thank you thank you thank you really appreciate all of the bitcoins uh okay go so"
3737840,3744000," let me see let me see let me see so we need to decide what um i think we're going to use in here"
3744000,3754080," um so i think i need to essentially uh separate this entire stuff to a function right so basically load"
3754080,3763840," uh or maybe a reload lib plug right so reload the plug so i think this thing should be a global thing"
3764640,3772640," um um right so this is a this should be a global variable like so um and this thing should be global"
3772640,3779840," thing as well right so essentially we're going to move all of this stuff to that function"
3779840,3790080," reload lib plug we're reloading with plug uh and here is the thing if lib plugin is not equal to null first"
3790080,3795280," thing we have to do we have to close that right so we're going to do dl close if it's already equal to"
3795280,3800400," null this is the first time we are reloading this entire thing so we are not going to do that uh so"
3800400,3807200," here then we're reopening and so on and so forth so another interesting thing is that uh i don't know we"
3807200,3820880," just return an integer right and if uh reload plugin um might as well return one return false yeah the other"
3820880,3827200," way around and then here in in case of success we return true and this is going to be the boolean so if we"
3827200,3836880," if we didn't load it successfully we're going to just return one okay cool um so now if the user is key"
3836880,3845440," pressed um key r let's use r specifically for here uh right so what we're going to do in here is simply"
3845440,3853440," call plug pre reload we're going to save the state right so here we got this state of the previous"
3853440,3862320," thing then we reload the lib plug and we do plug post reload and we pass the state in there and we continue"
3862320,3869600," as usual so here we're generating the frames the user pressed r we check for that we notify the old"
3869600,3875120," library that we're about to unload you uh right it gives us the state that it allocated with malik and"
3875120,3880320," stuff like that then we reload we kill it and then we pass that state to the next one so it can continue"
3880320,3886080," generating these frames that's basically what we're doing here that's basically what we do so and that's"
3886080,3892560," the basic hot reloader essentially isn't it cool i think that's pretty cool anyways so let's actually try"
3892560,3899120," to run this entire stuff and look at that so can i now reload some scheisse so for example here is"
3899120,3907440," the background what if i say the background has to be uh red right and now uh yeah so just a second"
3907440,3915200," yes ah fuck shit damn one more time so i probably have to run it in uh like like this in a separate"
3915200,3923200," process there we go so then i can essentially just keep rebuilding this entire thing yeah so like separately"
3923200,3928960," uh okay so this is a red thing so now i can say okay now i want green stuff now i want green"
3928960,3942160," stuff boom uh something didn't work okay but let's try to figure out what exactly was wrong"
3942160,3952400," uh right so as i don't know is key pressed key r uh so we just just do that reload lib blah blah what the"
3952400,3957680," fuck is going on bro what the fuck is going on we're supposed to literally like close this into anything if"
3957680,3962880," it's not equal to no then we just reload this entire thing it should just work bruh"
3962880,3968400," uh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh"
3968400,3977360," i enabled all the freaking warnings and that is not enough to catch that i'm gonna switch to rust i swear"
3977360,3984160," to god i'm gonna switch to rest okay i'm joking i'm switching back to that shitty language uh okay so let"
3984160,3989680," me see let me see let me see let me see let me see uh so now i can change let's change it to red uh right"
3989680,3999680," boom can your rust do that can your rest do that i don't think so i don't think so i don't need"
3999680,4004160," no python i don't need no lure i can do all of that in c"
4007200,4015040," i think the time has come to make a small break so uh yeah so now i can basically iterate on animation"
4015040,4020880," and stuff like that that is very cool that is very poggers i think it would be also kind of nice to"
4020880,4031120," maybe even set fps set target fps to 60 right so it's not going crazy too much uh and yeah so we can start"
4031120,4036640," doing animations and everything uh so afterwards uh we probably need to create some sort of like a"
4036640,4042080," separate mode that renders the uh you know ff impact videos and stuff like that so we'll see how it's"
4042080,4049280," gonna go but all of that is gonna be after the break um all right so what the fuck is this resolution can"
4049280,4056320," anybody tell me right so it's supposed to be uh 16 by 9 right so it should be something like this i think"
4056880,4061360," uh can i do it like that uh there we go so that's a little bit better that's a little bit too harsh i"
4061360,4069200," would say uh so let's actually just run it in a separate sort of thread and let's put a different"
4069200,4076320," background in here so where is the plug the plug is here uh so i think i can do something like get"
4076320,4084160," caller and then i just can say 18 18 18 ff all right so and then here i can simply just recompile"
4084160,4089280," this entire thing and just reload there we go so that's pretty cool the next step is probably going"
4089280,4094640," to be just drawing a rectangle uh just draw a rectangle and we're going to be drawing the"
4094640,4101600," rectangle so maybe at here 100 100 um and uh so we also have to specify the color so let's specify the"
4101600,4109520," color red like so and there we go we got a rectangle which is kind of cool isn't it i think that's kind of"
4109520,4117200," cool so the next thing uh maybe we can try to animate this that rectangle right so essentially"
4117200,4125680," we can animate its position right so maybe the position is going to be interpolated from zero to"
4125680,4135280," the actual width of the screen so we can take get screen width uh and we can essentially keep multiplying it"
4135280,4145520," it by sine of the delta time get oh my god max is going crazy uh okay so what i'm trying to do maybe"
4145520,4151600," i'm going to actually factor out uh this kind of thing to here so here we have a width right so which"
4151600,4161600," is the width of the screen and also delta time which is uh get uh frame frame time like so so then we can"
4162240,4168880," put things like this so this is going to be delta time and the problem with this uh sine is that it's"
4168880,4173760," going from minus one to one which is not particularly convenient so one of the things we want to do in"
4173760,4180960," here is add one which will make it go from zero to uh from zero to two and after that we want to kind of"
4180960,4188400," divide it by two to bring it back to uh you know from zero to one so one of the things maybe it makes sense"
4188400,4194160," to just like you know multiply it by five in here so something like this and that will make it go"
4194160,4200880," back and forth so to speak but not really it doesn't really do anything maybe because it's doing that"
4200880,4209280," super slowly uh right so uh when you want to actually slow it down how do you do that how do you do that"
4209280,4215760," does anybody know you you multiply it uh you make it bigger or you make it slower uh right so maybe you"
4215760,4222480," actually uh you know multiply it by something like this i don't remember in which direction that happens"
4222480,4231520," um oh i'm an idiot you're not supposed to use delta time you're supposed to use time right and it's"
4231520,4237440," actually possible to do that right so double time and it's like get time the amount of time since the"
4237440,4244480," beginning of the of the game so to speak it is it was a thing in in raylib if i'm not mistaken so it's"
4244480,4251440," literally get time yeah so get elapsed time in seconds since init window right so this is probably"
4251440,4257440," something we want to do uh right so and it's double but i want it float right so i want it to be float"
4258000,4264640," and if i can do that so that the time is not used uh-huh so and it is slowly moving right which means"
4264640,4271440," that we're not supposed to do it like that all right so let me see and it's moving actually in sort"
4271440,4278960," of like a sine motion isn't it beautiful i think that's pretty beautiful we can make it maybe a little bit"
4278960,4288800," faster uh maybe a little bit faster let me actually see what if i just multiply it by two uh right uh"
4288800,4298800," yeah so that's a bit faster now uh right a tiny bit faster so to be fair the window is kind of too big"
4298800,4306080," i would love to maybe make it smaller so usually i like to have like a factor in here uh factor like so"
4306720,4312400," and then have factor let's say maybe this time it's gonna be like 15 right but that will require"
4312400,4317760," like a total restart in here so which is probably fine for me uh right there we go so we're gonna"
4317760,4324080," have like a smaller window like this all right so and now we can just be creative all right we can be"
4324080,4329920," creative for example i didn't like that it overshoots in here i really don't like it so essentially what"
4329920,4335920," we want to do we want to kind of subtract the width of this rectangle so minus 100 uh like so"
4336560,4340400," all right all right and if i reload this entire thing it is not overshooting anymore"
4340400,4346080," it is not overshooting look ma no lua no python no scripting language"
4346080,4352560," how is that even possible it is possible you don't need scripting languages for this kind of"
4352560,4353680," stuff you just don't need them"
4357040,4365360," so yeah so we'll be kind of so um it would be nice to maybe um um separate that into like uh"
4365360,4371520," variables of some sort right so rectangle width is going to be 100 uh rectangle width rectangle height"
4371520,4379520," right so rectangle width rectangle height and here we also do rectangle width so the reason why i want"
4379520,4385920," to do it like that is because now i can do something cool i want to center this entire thing vertically"
4385920,4392960," right so somehow essentially i want to put it at the half of the height of the window right of the screen"
4392960,4399840," rather so this is going to be uh this is going to be something like this so this is going to be the height"
4402000,4409520," and down there this is a half of the height but then minus uh half of the height of the rectangle so that"
4409520,4415920," will kind of put it at the center so now it is going from left to right in the center so"
4419840,4429200," so that's pretty cool that is pretty pretty cool uh right so uh and essentially uh this is basically"
4429200,4436480," the kind of um the kind of animation that i want to make uh so essentially the first animation in my"
4436480,4442160," video is go is going to be the demonstration of what turing machine is right the demonstration of"
4442160,4449680," what turing machine is and i wanted to make a cool animation like the the tape sort of like uh"
4449680,4456640," scrolls in from from right to left right and also the head moves from left to right and they kind of"
4456640,4461680," sort of like uh moving with easing in and easing out and they kind of stop at particular thing and"
4461680,4467760," this sort of like this uh turing machine appears and then i can move around and show like how turing"
4467760,4472240," machine works and how it changes the state and how it substitutes the symbols and stuff like that"
4472240,4476240," it's kind of like a hand baby right and this is because i don't really know how exactly it's"
4476240,4481200," going to look like i just need to start sort of like creating this animation and then it will become"
4481200,4488080," obvious how it is going to look like uh right so and obviously uh the tape is not going to consist of a"
4488080,4494320," single thing it is going to consist of several things uh right so because of that maybe i want to stop"
4494320,4500640," this entire thing maybe somewhere at zero right so this entire thing is going to be at zero so"
4501200,4504960," uh it kind of stopped right so there we go it kind of stopped in here"
4504960,4512560," so afterwards uh we probably want to have several of the cells of the uh of the tapes so let's actually"
4512560,4518960," do something like uh size ti and let's say that i wanted two of them let's try to draw two of them"
4519840,4525040," uh like so plus plus i and we're going to just put the stuff in here uh and how we're going to be doing"
4525040,4536400," all that so it's sort of like x position uh very much depends on um on i right so initially i multiplied"
4536400,4544000," by the width of the um of the cell right so this is the width of the cell so if we try to do something"
4544000,4548800," like this uh it's basically going to create like a longer thing yeah yeah so but you can't see that"
4548800,4554000," it's two cells you can't really see that it's two cells so you need some sort of a padding right so"
4554000,4559120," let's actually introduce something something like pad uh which is maybe going to be related to the width"
4559120,4564480," of this entire thing so let's say that it's going to be width uh like a tenth of the width right so"
4564480,4570160," because of that we can say uh this one plus the padding so that will kind of separate these two"
4570160,4576000," things and we can actually see them and then we can quite easily say that we want 10 of them very"
4576000,4584000," easy so can you believe that i'm doing all that and see can you believe that i'm doing all that and see"
4584000,4593360," just just saying chat just saying uh right so and we can continue with this idea of sine sine and stuff"
4593360,4601360," like that we can just do sine uh t multiply it like by two uh right so and let's actually map it back"
4601360,4607840," into this thing so plus one uh right so this is going to plus one multiply by half right so and we're going"
4607840,4612960," to restart this entire thing and that didn't fucking work somehow that's surprising honestly"
4612960,4622160," um so this is because uh we probably want to uh yeah we probably want to multiply this entire thing"
4622160,4630480," by the width of the screen right so yeah so this is the entire sort of what's the tape doing what's the"
4630480,4636160," fucking tape doing all right so uh maybe i'm going to actually subtract this entire thing right so and"
4636160,4641840," it's actually going into the into the different place so this is the kind of thing i want to have in"
4641840,4648960," here right so maybe um maybe the padding is going to be slightly bigger maybe like a 15 of that so there"
4648960,4655040," as you can see there is more stuff in here uh right and maybe i'm going to have 20 of those things as"
4655040,4662720," well so now uh we have a tape that moves back and forth in here so sort of like this right so and i"
4662720,4668560," really like when you use sine it has like this easing on the ends of this entire stuff right some sort of"
4668560,4675920," easing which is kind of cool uh right so in terms of the the color we can actually factor out the color of"
4675920,4685520," this entire thing so for example cell color right so i can just put it somewhere here so color cell"
4685520,4693680," color like so and it's as far as i know there is something like color bright brightness right and it"
4693680,4698320," can say that i want to make this entire thing a little bit brighter but i think it will make it darker"
4698320,4702720," oh it's actually made it brighter okay so that's cool so miss i can do something like that so i can"
4702720,4711040," modify the the base color like so i can modify the base color all right and maybe in here something"
4711040,4716240," like yellow would be better okay i was kind of thinking about the yellow color and the yellow color"
4716240,4724080," was a little bit better so yes we got the tape we got the tape um"
4724080,4730880," interestingly so you know i want to be able to"
4730880,4737600," actually do this thing that i did in epurs if you know what i'm talking about"
4739600,4747280," the thing that i did in epurs where i had um a palette that i could modify at runtime"
4747280,4754000," right you know what i'm talking about right because it's kind of difficult to adjust well maybe"
4754000,4760320," maybe it's not that difficult honestly yeah maybe it's not that difficult if i have this kind of thing"
4760320,4766320," where i could just tweak things around maybe it's totally fine yeah maybe it's totally fine so"
4766320,4772320," all right so let me try to maybe put zero in here right so let's try to recompile this entire stuff and"
4772320,4775920," i'm just going to run it people say that it's a little bit dizzying so i'm going to actually stop"
4775920,4783520," doing that so one of the things we can do now if we want to adjust some colors we can do uh i think"
4783520,4791200," color hsv maybe get color i don't know what was that hsv thing does anybody remember how it was called"
4791200,4801200," actually does anybody remember so ray um lib hsv color to hsv no no color from hsv that's what we"
4801200,4808080," want to have in here okay so that's the thing we want to have uh right so here as far as now it's from"
4808080,4814480," zero two three uh 360 so i can put zero in here the saturation is going to be one the value is going"
4814480,4821280," to be one which basically gives you the full color in here right which is going to be red uh and now"
4821280,4830160," what you can do you can modify uh the saturation you can make it less saturated uh like so all right"
4830160,4836080," let's see that's already not a bad color and uh maybe it has a less value right which is going to make"
4836080,4843280," it darker like so maybe it's fine maybe modifying the colors like that is actually rather convenient"
4843280,4850160," i think it's rather convenient yeah so that's cool that's cool um all right so we're going to be doing"
4850160,4856880," it like that so we've got a tape that's cool so now we need to sort of like a draw the the head"
4856880,4863760," draw the head that sort of reads this tape and so on and so forth if you guys know what i'm talking about"
4863760,4870000," and i'm thinking about that thing being sort of like a frame right it's sort of like a frame that"
4870000,4880240," is just put in here right so and i wonder if you can draw frames in raylib uh so i can draw rectangle"
4880240,4886560," there should be something like draw rectangle lines look at that you can draw lines that don't fill in the"
4886560,4891200," in rectangles and i suppose we can even specify the thickness"
4891200,4897920," the thickness we can specify the thickness of the lines okay let's actually try to use that"
4897920,4906080," so all right so let's put that stuff in here so and it requires like a legit rectangle unfortunately so"
4906080,4910320," okay let's let's go ahead and just define this thing uh right so this is going to be something like"
4910320,4915440," that so in terms of x i think i'm going to position it at zero zero because i just want to experiment with"
4915440,4920400," this entire thing so this is going to be width in terms of width let's actually make it the width of"
4920400,4926000," you know the the original excel in here so they're going to be dependent on that so this is going to be"
4926000,4932960," height or h so and we're just like using that so the thickness i don't really know let's put 10 in here"
4932960,4937280," and this one i'm going to put yellow something like that all right so let's see if it's going to work"
4937280,4942880," so it doesn't like that what the hell is going on i forgot a semicolon in here classic freaking"
4942880,4947680," mother flipping classic and this is what we've got chat this is what we've got so this is sort of like"
4947680,4954640," the frame i want to have uh maybe i want to have it a little bit thicker a little bit like a tiny tiny bit"
4954640,4960560," thicker that's exactly what i'm talking about that's the thickness i want that's the thickness i want okay"
4961600,4968880," so uh that's pretty cool uh but i want to kind of position this entire thing at uh at the center in"
4968880,4973840," here so i wanted to be looking at this stuff right i wanted to be looking at this stuff how i can make"
4973840,4978960," it looking at this stuff that's a thick boy that's a thick boy indeed my new friend that's a thick boy"
4978960,4987840," indeed uh all right so i can just you know do the usual thing where i would say all right i'm gonna"
4987840,4994720," initialize it with zero and maybe i can update its y after i initialized it right so that kind of makes"
4994720,5002880," sense i think uh right so we can say that we have the height of this thing we're gonna divide it by two"
5002880,5009360," minus the half of the height of this thing so that's one way to do that that's essentially one"
5009360,5016160," way to do that and something went wrong what what is the error um so it's a height it's not called h sure"
5016160,5022880," it's not called it there we go so we kind of did that we kind of did that so unfortunately so in terms"
5022880,5031760," of x it's fine but i suppose if we want to um you know make it a little bit bigger i want it to be"
5031760,5042480," bigger than than the cell itself honestly when i'm reading this entire thing i think i want this the"
5042480,5051920," inner square to be of the size of the cell right to be the size of the cell uh how can i achieve that"
5051920,5056960," how can i achieve that i can only achieve that if i have the thickness uh as a separate variable so we"
5056960,5068160," can use that right so let's say head thick right so and let's put head thick in here like so uh all"
5068160,5079120," right so and now so maybe i'm gonna just put it like that um so essentially in terms of width and height i"
5079120,5090560," want to say that it's gonna be plus head thick two plus head thick two do you guys know why do you guys"
5090560,5097440," know why because i'm gonna just assume that the thickness is the full thing in here so that means"
5097440,5102880," i have to sort of like put it away in all of the sides in both of the sides left and right and top and"
5102880,5108320," bottom and that's basically my assumption that's why it's like two uh i'm not sure if it's gonna work out but"
5108320,5113520," but we'll see we'll see right so it's actually it kind of did work out honestly it actually it actually"
5113520,5120720," kind of did work out huh that's pretty cool that that is actually another google i wonder if we can"
5120720,5130080," try to adjust this entire thing just to see uh right how i can do all of that can i associate associate"
5130080,5138800," this the offset of this thing with the mouse position in raylib somehow get mouse but i can get the mouse"
5138800,5146720," position okay so i can essentially get the mouse position and take x for instance can i do like that"
5146720,5152960," that would have been kind of cool uh right okay i can actually so but"
5155040,5161120," this is so fucking funny that they can do this kind of shit so easily so then i can do plus uh all"
5161120,5169120," right so i can do plus and everything yeah so uh it's kind of it's kind of mad but yeah you can see you"
5169120,5174000," can see what the fuck is going on here yeah you can see so they kind of they kind of do the trick"
5174560,5181360," they kind of do the trick uh so let's actually try maybe so it's it's plus"
5181360,5190880," um but i also like to maybe subtract like half of the width of the screen right so then it's not it"
5190880,5197360," doesn't look that weird yeah there we go so now i can sort of play with this kind of thing you see you"
5197360,5203360," see what's going on here you see that's that's pretty cool right so and i haven't really recited"
5203360,5210080," the application so much yet right so i haven't restarted the application right so like at all"
5210080,5214880," like i'm doing all of that in runtime so that's the beauty of what reloading and again i'm not using"
5214880,5220800," any lure i'm not using any python not any dynamic language it's just the pure c and just the mechanism"
5220800,5232240," that's been in operating system for decades that's simple all right so what we are not doing here um"
5232240,5239680," maybe actually i'm gonna do four of the thickness so we have an extra sort of padding in here"
5239680,5248400," yeah that is not bad right so you kind of have this extra thing uh-huh that is actually super cool"
5248400,5256400," honestly that is actually kind of cool maybe it's too much what about like what about three right so"
5256400,5261840," uh let's actually see now that's a little bit better that's actually a little bit better"
5261840,5270560," that's pretty epic i think uh okay so we are actually subtracting half of the half of the screen"
5270560,5278240," what if we subtract full screen uh yeah so that's pretty cool so what if i position that thing"
5278400,5287920," at the center in x as well so rectangle x width half of that rectangle uh width half of that all right"
5287920,5294320," so let me freaking see if i go to semicolon that's totally fine that's totally fine and somewhere in"
5294320,5301840," the center right it looks cool so essentially the idea of the animation is that is the tape is sort of gonna"
5301840,5311360," like basically appear swoosh from right to left and the uh the head is also gonna sort of appear from the"
5311360,5317280," other side and they're gonna meet at some point in here like that and then after that we're gonna be"
5317280,5324320," playing animation how the head sort of like steps reads the thing changes the state then steps again and so on"
5324320,5331360," and so forth right so that's that's basically the idea in here the colors suck by the way the colors"
5331360,5335600," absolutely suck i'm gonna just adjust them and everything a little bit later but this is sort of"
5335600,5341280," the base of the scene i want to have in here and by the way the size of these cells are independent from"
5341280,5347360," the size of the window which is probably a problem right for instance if i change the uh you know the"
5347360,5354320," size of the window a little bit like a factor make it 100 uh right so it's gonna kind of stay the same"
5354320,5360800," on this yeah so i think the uh like the actual animation is gonna like happen at this resolution"
5360800,5366160," roughly roughly at this resolution and i'm not sure if it's gonna be dark scene honestly"
5366160,5371440," i'm actually not sure if it's gonna be dark scene and the ghost don't suck we're just sponsored by mcdonald's"
5376880,5384000," it is mcdonald's actually colors i didn't realize that all right needs more brown"
5384000,5392400," i'm sorry i actually want it's like a little bit brighter colors for the background at least"
5392400,5402240," but we'll see how it goes we'll see how it goes okay so let me let me actually try some stuff um so"
5402240,5413840," where is the plugin where is the plugin and what if i what if we go back to the you know dizzying"
5415520,5430400," sign animation how it's gonna look like the fuck is okay it's pretty"
5430400,5442480," um all right um let's pretend you you never saw that you you you never saw that actually"
5442480,5454080," uh okay um so what i want to introduce like i want to be able to somehow customize um different"
5454080,5461600," interpolators like that as you can see uh here i'm using time as an interpolator right i'm using time as"
5461600,5468480," interpolate in fact i'm using time plus sign as an interpolator uh here i'm using mouse as an interpolator"
5468480,5475280," and so on and so on and so forth so essentially i want to um um sort of like have a system that allows"
5475280,5482800," you to compose different chunks of interpolators right so i think i already tried to develop such"
5482800,5491120," system before several times uh right and let me try to describe what exactly i mean by that so"
5491440,5497360," um let me think so there should be should be some sort of a chunk but i'm not sure if i'm going to call"
5497360,5503280," it like that so and it's going to be basically interpolated like from one value to another value"
5503280,5510720," and these values are supposed to be like from zero to one right so and then you have just like a bunch"
5510720,5515840," of chunks in here maybe we're going to make it a dynamic array so something like chunks uh right so it's going"
5515840,5522240," going to be chunk it's going to be items and in here is going to be size count and the capacity size"
5522240,5527840," count and the capacity and you just like append a bunch of chunks and so on and so forth"
5527840,5534960," um right so but this is basically the value of the interpolator that has to change from"
5534960,5541920," this value to this value we also need to store the duration within which that change has to happen"
5542560,5548880," right so i suppose we're going to store it here as well duration so how do you call this kind of"
5548880,5555200," chunks actually all right so how do you call this kind of chunks um right i'm not really sure how exactly"
5555200,5563280," but yeah so in essentially um we're gonna have some sort of animation style it's not a style that's for sure"
5563840,5575520," that's not style uh right so an animation which basically stores um the current value of the"
5575520,5582240," interpolator keyframes this is not that well maybe it's actually keyframes yeah that's a good point i think"
5582240,5588240," it's a keyframe uh i think it's kind of like a keyframe uh so let's actually rename them okay"
5590400,5598800," so keyframe uh at least for now i think it's a good name for this stuff so and this is keyframes"
5598800,5607040," there we go and animation it's basically stores its current value of the interpolator let's actually"
5607040,5615040," call it c all right and maybe it's also going to store the um the duration of like the whole duration"
5615040,5620240," of the animation or the duration of the current like keyframe that we're currently playing so then we"
5620240,5625920," switch to another one and then another one and another one and so on and so forth uh right so we're"
5625920,5634400," going to call it like a duration it's something like this something like this um okay uh so and essentially"
5635600,5643280," we i want to have uh a function that updates animation updates animation it accepts uh the"
5643280,5648800," animation by a pointer because it's going to be modifying it and i suppose it's going to accept the"
5648800,5657280," keyframes in here um so i could have accepted yeah i can just accept this entire thing like this i'm going to call it"
5657280,5666960," keyframe um yeah that's cool so also the animation should keep track of the index of the keyframe it"
5666960,5673600," is currently playing right so that's one of the things it has to do uh right so let's actually put"
5673600,5681200," like size t in here uh like index maybe i let's call it i i think that's fine uh right so and essentially"
5681200,5686880," how we're going to be updating this entire stuff um so we do have the delta time so let's put the data"
5686880,5700240," time get frame time like so and essentially we know that we're currently playing uh this frame right so i"
5700240,5708080," is an index of the keyframe that we're currently playing right so we know the duration uh of this thing"
5708080,5715200," that we have to play we know the duration and also uh as we update this entire thing"
5715200,5722160," as we update this entire thing we probably have to update our own duration here uh something like this"
5722160,5729120," plus dt so i suppose we're switching the frame we're switching the frame when"
5729120,5737360," the duration of the animation right became greater or equal to the duration of the current keyframe"
5737360,5744400," so that's the sign for us to switch to sort of the next keyframe and stuff like that so by the way"
5744400,5749040," because of that since we know the duration the current duration of the animation and duration of"
5749040,5756160," this thing we don't really need to keep track of the t because we can just compute it right so if you want to"
5756160,5763440," know the current interpolator and stuff like that uh what you should do is just simply you know take that"
5763440,5774080," divide by that and you have a value from zero to one and you simply interpolate uh right you simply interpolate"
5774720,5787200," from this thing like from this thing very simple very simple formula very simple formula almost"
5787200,5795600," i know i know it's funny uh anyway so uh we can actually simplify all of that formula if we factor out"
5795600,5801360," this kind of this kind of thing uh right so let me actually put it a little bit here uh we can always"
5801360,5807680," factor out to something like this so i think it would make sense to actually call it kfs almost like kfc but"
5807680,5816160," it's actually kfs uh right so in here we just replace this with kf it's the current frame so to speak"
5816720,5826000," um right and essentially we just do keyframe kf is going to be a pointer and we're just taking that"
5826000,5833840," specific pointer but it's a little bit dangerous in the sense that i can overflow the amount of keyframes"
5833840,5840240," we have in here so i suppose one of the things we need to do we need to check that this thing is less"
5840240,5844880," than the amount of frames we have in here so i don't really know why i like dereference it in here it"
5844880,5849360," doesn't really matter uh the compiler will tell me that something is wrong here anyway so it doesn't"
5849360,5858160," matter uh right so and that kind of simplifies right so uh like so so we make sure that the"
5858160,5863600," animation currently playing with the right keyframe so we then take a pointer to that keyframe and now"
5863600,5869040," we don't have to write this huge expression and stuff like that which is rather convenient i think"
5869040,5873600," i think it is rather convenient anyways so and then the actual interpolator for animations and"
5873600,5879200," shit like that can be computed like this right can be computed like this so we can even factor that"
5879200,5887040," out to a separate function sort of like um you know animation uh you know interpolator interpolator"
5887040,5892880," which is a huge freaking name but i mean what what else can i say here oh by the way it it has to be"
5892880,5896880," the reference whatever the compiler will tell me that i'm doing something wrong it doesn't matter"
5896880,5906880," um all right so i can just move this entire thing to here uh and the funny thing is that we have to"
5906880,5914320," check whether we are overflowing the keyframes again uh right we have to check that we are flowing these"
5914320,5917760," things again so because of that i think i'm going to implement that a little bit later because i don't"
5917760,5925760," want to be dealing with this stuff right now anyways so what we're doing what we have to do in here is"
5925760,5934160," essentially uh we have to switch to the next frame right switch to the next frame and we have to kind"
5934160,5939200," of update the duration right so we have to sort of say okay subtract the duration so if there is a little"
5939200,5946480," bit of overshooting a little bit of overshooting to the next keyframe we want to kind of keep that"
5946480,5953600," remainder in there but what if the delta time overshoot it over several keyframes so that means"
5953600,5959200," we have to do that in the loop right so while duration is bigger than the current like keyframe"
5959200,5964960," that we have in here uh we have to sort of like a keep updating this entire thing so we do plus one"
5964960,5973440," and we also have to actually say that uh so while it's greater and uh sort of like the next one"
5973440,5982160," is still less than whatever keyframes we have in here we have to keep updating this entire stuff"
5982160,5988320," but keep updating and so on and so forth uh and i suppose all right i suppose we have to"
5988320,5993120," also reassign this entire thing right because we can't be referring to this thing"
5993840,5998880," so that's basically what we're doing this entire stuff uh right so that's basically how we're doing"
5998880,6007280," all this entire stuff uh until we sort of like reach the um the animation um so okay that's a pretty"
6007280,6013920," simple way to do that it's a very simple way to do that uh okay let me see if it compiles or not"
6013920,6020560," uh yes yes yes so this is i this has to be like that uh what else do we have in here so yeah so that"
6020560,6027840," compiles that compiles uh so and essentially what i can do now what i can do with this kind of stuff"
6027840,6036000," now i can do pretty cool things i think um i can define a bunch of keyframes in here right so for"
6036000,6042960," instance i can have keyframes uh kfs and it's initially going to be zero and then i can just append a bunch of"
6042960,6051600," things so snob um you know di append uh kfs and this is going to be chunk to be fair you know what i"
6051600,6058320," can define this stuff like just like this and then just define them yeah so that's that's even better"
6058320,6071280," and then i can say okay so i want to move the interpolator from zero to one zero to one uh during like one second"
6072720,6079040," during one second so that's the first thing i want to do then i can say all right so then i"
6079040,6089440," move from one to zero from one to zero during um let's say 250 milliseconds and i can stack these chunks"
6089440,6094320," on top of each other i can stack these chunks on top of each other and this is sort of like the keyframes"
6094320,6104000," that i have in here so that's basically like how i can animate things now um right so because i i want"
6104000,6109200," to be able to use the statics arrays and stuff like that i think it makes sense for me to not like even"
6109200,6114000," have dynamic array in here uh right so it would be better to just like literally accept this kind of"
6114000,6120800," thing like this and then maybe have tfs uh count like so so let's actually go to the compilation errors and see"
6120800,6127680," what it's going to say so this is going to be just account uh this is yeah just keyfs uh like so and"
6127680,6132640," keyfs can you see shed in here i think you should be able to see the shed in here"
6132640,6141920," so this is just a keyfs and uh yeah there we go so that seems to be cool all right so now i can create"
6141920,6149360," an animation right so what's called uh a and it's going to be just zero like so so in animation we have"
6149360,6159200," just i and duration and so on and so forth all right so uh now every frame sort of speak every frame i'm"
6159200,6166720," doing uh update animation a um keyfs and then i need to take the size of this array so it's going"
6166720,6174160," to be knob array len keyfs right so that's pretty cool i think so since we're going to be updating this"
6174160,6179440," and that stuff so we can you can actually do it like that so now look look look so what's cool is that um"
6180640,6189520," animation just now within given like period of time contains these values depending on what current"
6189520,6195040," keyframe we're playing so yeah maybe i'm going to even create an editor that will allow me to"
6195040,6200560," sort of like visually modify these things so we can adjust animation and everything and maybe save them"
6200560,6206080," to a separate file and stuff like that so it's going to be like an animation editor like in like an engine"
6206080,6210560," version or so to speak but in an engine you have like an actual editor here you can modify it in the"
6210560,6216160," code but developing such editor for nodes is going to be actually pretty trivial thing um so we'll see"
6216160,6223360," how it goes we'll see how it goes we'll see how it goes the thing i need in here again uh i need um to"
6223360,6230240," get the interpolator somehow right so it's going to be animation um what's going to be the thing so maybe"
6230240,6235600," value right so maybe some sort of like a value uh and in here we just accept this kind of thing"
6235600,6241840," and we also need to accept the keyframes because um this is where we're getting all of that stuff from"
6241840,6248640," this is where we're getting all that stuff from um so interestingly so there could be a situation when"
6248640,6254000," we have this kind of thing right so when when we overflown uh this stuff so it has to be actually"
6254000,6265360," greater so if a uh i a i by the way right so a i is greater or equal than the amount of keyframes"
6265360,6271680," we have in here we can simply return as of right now it's like the last thing in here so it's been"
6271680,6276880," count minus one uh two right we're literally returning the last possible value because the"
6276880,6282080," animation sort of overshoot uh everything in here so we don't really care anyway so now"
6283280,6290640," once we have i we can take the current keyframe right so pretty safely and then simply compute"
6290640,6297760," the the following thing the duration divided by a key f duration so this is a value from zero to one"
6297760,6302800," so and in here we can just interpolate so in ray leap i think there was an interpolator right so"
6302800,6311440," there was a lerp yeah so this is what we need in here so the start is going to be kf from the end is"
6311440,6318880," going to be kf two and the amount is basically this relationship and we simply return this entire"
6318880,6324960," stuff all right look at that so this is animation billy maybe i'm going to call it animation update"
6324960,6335760," um yep yep yep yep yep yep i'm sorry so animation update uh so now uh we're updating this entire stuff every"
6335760,6340400," frame right so we're updating this entire stuff every frame and then we probably need to get the value of this"
6340400,6348160," this entire thing so let's call it t uh animation value i'm just passing this stuff like that"
6348160,6357120," right and now i can use this t instead of this nasty synth right so i can use this t instead of this nasty"
6357120,6363600," synth and look what is going to fucking happen mate uh it's not going to even fucking compile because"
6363600,6368240," so we already have the t okay so there's a couple of things here let's go to the compilation areas okay"
6368240,6376160," so lerp uh we need to include math math math math math uh what else do we have in here kf yeah all of"
6376160,6382320," that is a pointer that is understandable what else do we have in here so we have this kind of"
6382320,6390160," shit so this is t which is redefinition we don't need this shit anymore uh okay so uh we don't"
6390160,6397120," have knob array so let's include a knob here as well i think it's going to be useful within this entire"
6397120,6404880," stuff knob is not found now it is found everyone is freaking happy let's remove that shit nobody needs that"
6404880,6415360," cool everything compiles now look at that shit so we have two key frames two key frames move the value"
6415360,6423360," from zero to one within a single second after that move the value from one to zero within two hundred uh"
6423360,6432560," in 50 milliseconds what is it going to be right if you think about it's like one second you rising up"
6432560,6436480," one second and then you falling for quarter of the second"
6436480,6443040," make sense make sense okay let's reload that"
6443040,6451360," shit didn't work okay that's very interesting uh i think i know why"
6452480,6458640," because this thing yeah it's understandable because it's reset on each individual frame"
6458640,6464560," we need to make it survive between the frames uh right so we need to make it survive between"
6464560,6470800," the frames and one way to do that is to actually move it into the plug state but there is an easier"
6470800,6477280," way to do that you can actually declare it as a static which is doesn't require restating the whole"
6477280,6482160," application but then it's going to reset this entire state on each update"
6482480,6487680," so there is like this kind of stuff so you want to keep stuff in the plug-in state only for the"
6487680,6493520," things that you want to want to survive between reloads which in our case is not really that important"
6493520,6498800," honestly we're not like making a complicated game that is very difficult to get into a particular state"
6498800,6503440," or do we i don't really know we'll see we'll see maybe at some point i will realize that like"
6503440,6508160," having this kind of like a persistent state between reload is kind of an overkill"
6508160,6513440," uh but we'll see we'll see so did my application crash or something it's not a crash i think"
6514240,6526240," uh anyway did you see that"
6526240,6537600," so and that's the point of these keyframes now i can stack this entire stuff on top of each other"
6538320,6548480," right so now i can say like for example from zero to uh 250 uh within um i don't know within uh also"
6548480,6557680," maybe like a quarter of the second then we can basically stay in that value for this amount of time"
6558560,6569440," right and then we can move super quickly maybe move slowly uh like from that value to one for this"
6569440,6576000," amount of time so i can now control this kind of things i can now control this kind of things which"
6576000,6587280," is actually exactly what i want right so so maybe we we also want to sort of loop"
6587920,6593280," this kind of animations right sort of like loop this kind of animations uh maybe we're going to introduce"
6593280,6604080," something like loop um and what is it going to do is when you reach to this state if ai"
6604080,6610400," is greater or equal than kfc count right so what you want to do you want to basically mem set this"
6610400,6618320," this entire thing to zero uh like so so it will repeat itself why am i"
6618320,6628720," and we only want to do that if we are looping i suppose right so a"
6628720,6639760," uh looping if a looping and that uh we're gonna do that like i'm surprised that it didn't happen so that's kind of interesting so looping is true"
6639760,6642240," is true"
6642240,6651200," ah because it was in animation update well i mean it is animation update so what's up with that"
6651200,6658640," um it's not and yeah it's actually loop not looping right and this is just loop okay"
6659440,6664400," so i expect this thing to work so that's kind of bizarre isn't it"
6664400,6669680," hey hey hey why why didn't it work excuse me"
6669680,6677920," that's that's bizarre my new friend that's bizarre what the is going on"
6677920,6682000," and so on and so maybe it didn't update it properly like especially if you have stat oh"
6682000,6684400," fuck"
6684400,6689120," these static initializers are probably done in"
6689120,6693440," special like init functions of this thing"
6693440,6698640," right because i know that according to elf you have shed like underscore init"
6699200,6704720," and so on and so forth and these initializations of like static fields and stuff like that are"
6704720,6713520," probably done in these things i think maybe because i kind of had a similar problem in uh in visualizer"
6713520,6720240," too i'm kind of had a similar problem in visualizer too so that's actually kind of cool"
6720240,6725920," um all right so i want to google it up honestly because it's kind of a fascinating like does anybody"
6725920,6733040," know does anybody know like where all of these things are initialized uh right so init function of"
6733040,6741360," as so maybe we can chat ask chat gpt to confabulate some uh executing init and fne well okay we have some"
6741360,6749600," some real humans speaking in on stackover form uh yeah so i just read in need and fne"
6749600,6756560," sections in elf files and give it a try uh so i do blah blah blah result is did is there any"
6756560,6762720," official documentation about init fne don't do that let your compiler and link you fill in those sections"
6762720,6769680," as they see fit you are too dumb dummy dumb dumb for this kind of shirt let the smarter people then"
6769680,6777520," you figure it out and you know you know i hate answers like that like jesus christ this is why"
6777520,6782240," by the way people like chat gpt more than answers on stack overflow because of people like this"
6782240,6790000," and you're too dumb and you don't do that compilers management you hate it"
6790000,6797120," fucking hate it so yeah probably we can just try to uh maybe uh like literally try to call this function"
6797120,6805520," i don't know but um yeah so we'll see uh by the way so maybe this thing is still useful for uh for some"
6805520,6813840," other stuff uh yeah so we can try to just like load them up like this all right just try to load them up"
6813840,6817200," like this okay um so"
6817200,6824240," we can put this kind of stuff in here so it's going to be void"
6824240,6833280," in it and like maybe i'm doing something incorrect maybe these particular functions have like different"
6833280,6838240," signature maybe they accept something and doing it like that is dangerous and i should actually rely on"
6838240,6843040," the compiler because i'm too dumb for that but i don't fucking care if it's incorrect and it will"
6843040,6848880," fail i want it to fail so i can learn something new right i want to learn something new i want this"
6848880,6854720," thing to slap me in the face right i'm not afraid of that i'm pretty sure this person who said stuff like"
6854720,6861280," that they are afraid of the compiler slapping them in the face but i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm brave"
6861280,6869360," like that so i'm gonna just go ahead load that up and call it and call it and this"
6869360,6876400," stack overflow answers won't be able to stop me they won't be able to stop me they will be screaming"
6876400,6880720," they will be sending me death threats in emails but i'm gonna do that nonetheless"
6882000,6889520," that's right that's right because that's how it's done that's how you learn things by getting slapped"
6889520,6901120," in the face anyways uh so uh what we need to do in here uh right so let me let me see so this is"
6901120,6909120," gonna be just like a neat and i wonder maybe it's gonna actually collide with uh whatever symbol in need"
6909120,6915680," that we have in the program which is fine i want to get slapped in the face that's the point i want to"
6915680,6920720," get slapped in the face uh right so we initialize this thing so we probably need to do in it and i"
6920720,6927360," wonder if i after reloading right after reloading i i basically want to call it again one more time"
6927360,6933040," right so let's see let's see so i'm going to try to reload this entire thing and yeah so multiple"
6933040,6938560," definitions of any okay so there we go uh so what we want to do actually is to have"
6939600,6945680," so so we already have a plug in it so let's call it plug elf in it right so it's going to be something"
6945680,6955120," like that so it's going to be plug alfinite uh right and we're going to do plug elf in it a plug elf"
6955120,6962800," in it and in here we're going to say plug alfinite right but we're still going to be referring to"
6962800,6970320," underscore anything here that's kind of the point there we go so if i try to run that uh undefined"
6970320,6976480," symbol image that's very interesting actually so it's not exported per se uh there we go that's exactly"
6976480,6984240," what i'm talking about we've learned something uh so uh huh so i suppose it's kind of like a private so"
6984240,6991840," it's not really um exposed to us which is rather interesting but can i now do something very"
6991840,7002000," fucking kinky like extern uh right like this can i do something kinky like that and will it actually"
7002000,7008160," expert that that's a very interesting question like i'm really curious like i want to learn i want to"
7008160,7014320," learn you won't be able to stop me a random stack overflow answer you won't be able to stop me i'm on"
7014320,7021520," my way to learn i'm on my way to learn i'm unstoppable all right so uh let me let me see what we have in"
7021520,7029440," here so it's gonna be uh this and let me see so in it uh it's still a small t which i'm not really sure"
7029440,7036160," if that affects the visibility or something like that uh right so let me now try to run this entire thing"
7036160,7044080," uh okay so it's it's i still can't love it okay i give up you won random stack overflow answer this time"
7044880,7050960," but i mean i learned some things right so i think it was kind of like educational to"
7050960,7057680," around just try these different ideas and stuff like that uh and my hypothesis again is that all"
7057680,7065360," these initializations are done within uh within one of these initializers right and my job is to basically"
7065360,7071600," code somehow uh but i'm not really sure how exactly i'm going to go on that so yeah we'll see so okay"
7071600,7076960," so since i restarted the application anyway since i restarted the application anyway i might as well"
7076960,7088160," actually um just simply put that animation put that animation to uh to the plugin in here right so i can do"
7088160,7094320," like that who said i can't do that i can't do that all right so and when we initialize this and i think"
7094320,7101680," i can say so we already zero initialize this entire stuff so we can do p a uh loop and it's going to be"
7101680,7108800," true so the definition of the animation is probably somewhere there so we probably want to make it"
7108800,7116720," here so it is visible for the plug let's try to recompile this entire stuff so we have a so we have to do"
7116720,7123120," something like this what else do we have in here pa looking good so we don't need that"
7123120,7126720," not a freaking second"
7130480,7141200," so i had a fucking wacky situation"
7141200,7146400," i literally had a fucking wacky situation"
7146400,7155200," let's go back let's go fucking back right so i was assigning elf but i was checking the thing that was"
7155200,7161040," already null i literally had a fucking wacky situation so maybe that we can still save that"
7161040,7167040," we can we can probably still fucking save that all right so let's actually go back and define the"
7167040,7172880," animation inside like in the static memory in here uh all right so we're we're going back into the static"
7172880,7181360," realm okay that's cool so and in a plug dot h we're bringing this thing back so we brought this thing back"
7181360,7186800," we brought this thing back and the main here we brought this thing back okay so that's pretty cool"
7186800,7192400," so we're initializing that we also need to yeah so we also call in all of that stuff in here okay so"
7192400,7200240," all right all that compiles and if i try to run that it still fails okay right it still can't find that"
7200240,7205360," symbol right despite us actually properly checking things right right and i do think we actually properly"
7205360,7210240," check these things like this time right because you can see all right okay so enough of that enough"
7210240,7215840," of that enough of that uh all right so we're just trying to learn things just trying to learn things"
7215840,7221440," nothing more nothing else all right so let's bring all of that stuff in here"
7221440,7224320," like so boom boom"
7225440,7234720," uh and where is the definition of the on the material on the material like so boom and let's go to the"
7234720,7241280," computation analysis because well in plugin it what do we want to do i want to do pa and i want to make it"
7241280,7252560," loop like so uh let's try to compile all right so a pa anything else the second one pa anything else okay"
7252560,7258080," something something something else in here we don't have this function uh what else we don't have that"
7258080,7268640," function okay okay that's cool it doesn't loop doesn't motherfucking loop doesn't motherfucking"
7268640,7274880," i have no idea why uh right so because i like would expect it to do that"
7275920,7284240," move i think i know what kind of stuff i can do um i think i know maybe we have to do it in here"
7284240,7285600," all right so essentially"
7285600,7294480," if yeah so we went to overflow in here"
7304080,7310960," so we're doing kind of a weird check honestly we're kind of doing a weird check so we first have to"
7310960,7320800," check that we are within that stuff right we are within that stuff and then i suppose we have to do"
7320800,7326800," probably k so this time is kind of easier right so maybe i should get rid of this thing yeah i should"
7326800,7332880," get rid of this thing it's not helping anybody so while we are at here and we are at here"
7333600,7338880," we're just incrementing this thing and we're subtracting um you know"
7338880,7346160," the duration from here so we have to be actually subtracting the duration from here"
7346160,7353840," uh so we are greater than that we subtract that duration that overflue and we just go to the next one"
7353840,7363120," until we completely overflow the keyframes and if we are in here if we are in here and if we are looping"
7363600,7371440," right we are we are looping we just memsets ah once i see one single mem set okay this is so dumb"
7371440,7372720," it's where to get"
7375040,7379920," that memsets that mem set also sets loop to false which means it actually is not looping anymore so"
7379920,7388400," that's basically so dumb all right so this is going to be zero uh right and this is going to be duration"
7388400,7397600," also zero uh all right so something like this this is what we want right if we overflue and we are looping"
7397600,7405440," we're just going back um right we're just going back we're trying that uh but this one is kind of like"
7405440,7414000," kind of weird because what if kfs is equal to zero and we're looping this one is going to be really weird"
7414000,7420640," honestly this one is going to be really weird for this kind of situation right how we're going to even do"
7420640,7428320," that uh we're going to kind of assert maybe uh assert that kfs count is greater than zero at least for now"
7428320,7435840," and i'm going to try to figure out a little bit later all right so honestly i'm going to assert that on"
7435840,7442720," on all of them right so we kind of expect you to have at least one thing uh right so it's just like"
7442720,7449600," yeah that makes sense all right so let's try to now do this kind of thing uh is it going to work"
7449600,7454880," and this one is a duration which is understandable yeah okay so now it's looping"
7454880,7472000," yeah almost kind of makes sense but there is like three um so it waits for a little bit on one thing and"
7472720,7475120," i can't feel that it is waiting"
7475120,7484800," yeah that's that's bizarre that's actually bizarre how it is not really waiting properly"
7484800,7493600," so this is the duration while this thing and duration is greater or equal than the current"
7493600,7500240," duration we separating the current and go to the next one goes too far that's totally fine that's totally fine"
7500240,7512880," uh yeah but i mean that's that's okay so for the if i do loop uh actually equal to false if i do look"
7512880,7516560," actually equal to false yeah that's fine"
7516560,7521360," and then it just stops"
7521360,7534080," yeah that's bizarre but i mean that's fine so we have a system of keyframes and we now can do something"
7534080,7540320," with them so one of the another things i want to do at some point is an ability to interpolate uh like"
7540320,7546640," ease in and ease out things right with different like functions and stuff like that so is easing yeah"
7546640,7552640," yeah so this kind of stuff so we can just add uh so this is a really cool website i really recommend"
7552640,7558080," to check it out uh right we can add some sort of like a parameter which says what kind of easing function"
7558080,7563920," to use in here uh right and stuff like that in the future i also plan to have a busier curves right so"
7563920,7569120," we're going to do a busy curve stream so we already kind of did it before uh but i want to do it one more"
7569120,7576720," time so uh let me go to the description and stuff like that uh but yeah so i think this is a great start"
7576720,7582720," so this is going to be the base for the animation framework all right so and yeah i'm going to be using"
7582720,7590240," it to making animations for for the main video so but i guess that's it for today right at least for now"
7590240,7595440," right thanks everyone who's watching right now i really appreciate it have a good one and see you"
7595440,7602880," all on the next recreation programming session with amista azuz i love you"
