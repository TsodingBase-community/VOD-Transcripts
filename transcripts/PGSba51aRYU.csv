880,8120," Looks like we're live. Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session. How about that?"
8120,14400," I bet you didn't expect that shit. So let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start the stream as usual."
14400,19960," I'm going to put a red circle, then I'm going to say live on Twitch."
19960,24100," And what are we doing today on Twitch.at television website?"
24100,29420," Today we are doing machine learning in C."
30000,33340," How about that? I bet you didn't expect that shit to happen. I didn't for sure."
33340,40740," Twitch.tv slash surfing. This is the place where we're doing all that and I'm going to ping everyone who's interested in being pinged."
40740,47460," There we go. The stream has officially started. The stream has officially started. Hello, hello everyone. Welcome, welcome, welcome."
47460,54360," So, machine learning. Right. So you probably heard about this thing for quite some time. Right."
54360,58160," So, it's rather a hot thing, I would say."
58160,64200," So, and I'm going to tell you that I'm not a specialist in that area at all."
64200,67800," I'm just like, you know, you know, third person observer."
67800,74000," I understand some of the things, but I'm in no way claiming to be an authority on this topic."
74000,74720," That's for sure."
75160,78880," So, take everything that I say with a grain of pepper."
78880,82500," So, essentially, what is machine learning?"
82500,86140," I'm going to explain you how I understand this entire area."
86140,91460," I understand this as the entire area as sort of like a different paradigm of programming."
91460,91860," Right."
91860,95080," So, you know, we have several paradigms of programming."
95220,98160," Actually, we have two main paradigms of programming."
98160,104400," It's, you know, imperative programming and sort of like a functional programming."
104400,105820," Right."
105820,110660," So, but I think machine learning is more of like another third paradigm."
110660,111640," Right."
111640,114740," In the first two paradigms, you write the code directly."
114740,115240," Right."
115240,120360," So, you have a particular goal and you're trying to achieve that goal by just literally writing that code."
120780,127420," In case of machine learning, you're not really writing the code of the thing that you're going to be executing directly."
127420,128320," Right."
128320,130780," Essentially, you have some sort of a model."
130780,131360," Right."
131360,139480," That models some sort of a process that you want to predict or do something with that or maybe even optimize that entire thing."
139480,141980," And this model has certain parameters."
141980,142640," Right."
142640,144180," This model has certain parameters."
144180,152320," And what you code, you code of the description of what you expect from this model."
152320,154880," Like, how do you expect it to behave?"
154880,162680," And then you give your untrained model and the description of how it's supposed to behave to a learning process."
162680,167420," And it just like tweaks it around until it fits your description well enough."
167580,173940," And there you go, you've got the thing that does what you want probably with a certain probability because it's never going to be perfect."
173940,174760," Right."
174760,178900," So, and that's how I understand it."
178900,183600," So, I personally like to call it automatic mathematical modeling."
183600,184040," Right."
184080,188600," Because this is the thing that people have been doing for ages, actually."
188600,191560," For, yeah, for ages, essentially."
191560,194200," Mathematical modeling by itself."
194200,198980," We actually learned this sort of a discipline in university."
198980,199900," I went to university."
199900,202540," I got a degree in feral metallurgy."
202540,203360," Right."
204320,221780," I like to joke that I have a degree in rust, literally in rust, because feral metallurgy is a branch of chemistry that is concerned with converting feral oxide to steel, cast iron, and stuff like that."
221780,228080," So, it's an entire branch of chemistry concerned with processing feral oxide, a.k.a. rust."
228080,230700," So, I literally have a degree in rust."
230700,237260," So, and rust comes in the form usually of iron ore."
237260,245660," So, iron ore is usually literally rust, unless it's like a different kind of feral oxide, which is black, which is magnetite."
245660,246820," I think it's called magnetite."
246820,248000," All right."
248000,253280," So, and it's usually processed differently, but usually it's the red one."
253280,253660," Right."
253660,254720," It's the red one."
255340,261380," So, and essentially mathematical model for modeling for that specific area was extremely important."
261380,261820," Right."
261820,274780," So, essentially, because it's this branch of chemistry was extremely concerned with industrial processes of converting rust into usable iron, right?"
274780,276560," Steel and stuff like that."
276560,281340," So, and essentially the industrial process was extremely expensive."
281660,289860," Actually, it was extremely expensive to start and then you have to waste a bunch of resources to get some sort of like a small yield."
289860,305200," So, and what the scientists who were working in that area were concerned with is what's the optimal combination of parameters for that process, right?"
305200,307260," What's the optimal combination of parameters for that process?"
307260,312260," We could just like literally experiment."
312260,318480," We could literally experiment and see like which one yields the best, but it's too fucking expensive, right?"
318480,320160," It's just too freaking expensive."
320160,325620," No one would literally allow you to waste money just to find the optimal thing."
325860,331320," So, what people were doing instead, they were making fewer experiments, right?"
331320,335000," Fewer experiments and each experiment would be like a point on a graph."
335000,339640," And then they would create a mathematical model that fits that data."
339640,347760," And using that mathematical model, they would predict what would be the best, you know, parameters for that specific model, right?"
347860,360380," So, and all of that was done hundreds of years ago, like maybe like more than 100 years ago, fucking manually, on a piece of paper, with a fucking pencil, with nerds like me, right?"
360380,364200," In glasses and anyway."
364740,369420," So, because there was no computers at the time, but people were doing that anyway."
369420,373380," These days, the same process is simply automated."
373380,375260," How is it automated?"
375260,377340," You just conduct a bunch of experiments."
377340,379540," You feed those experiments into the computer."
379540,383340," It just does automatic mathematical model and you've got the mathematical model."
383340,385400," You can do whatever the fuck you want with it."
385400,387920," And that's basically machinery, right?"
387920,394180," So, essentially, you have the data, how your model is supposed to, is expected to behave."
394560,397040," Then we just tweak around the model, right?"
397040,400260," Trying to see which model will fit that specific data."
400260,401340," And there you go."
401340,405040," So, that's basically, that's basically what it is."
405040,407800," Something that was made, right?"
407800,415140," Something that was made manually, long time ago, now is completely automatic, right?"
415140,419200," And today, I would like to explore, because here's an interesting thing."
419200,422520," I actually explained a very simple case."
423100,426240," A very, not really very simple case."
426240,430340," A very kind of like a mundane case, which is not probably interesting for anybody."
430340,435780," You would say, oh, machine learning is only applied to this, like, boring shit ass that nobody gives a fuck about."
435780,437080," What the fuck is a fair mythology?"
437080,438060," You're fucking crazy."
438060,440140," Who fucking needs all that shit except the nerds?"
440140,442200," I understand that, but here's an interesting thing."
442200,445040," You can model anything."
445040,448520," Literally anything."
448520,452460," For anything that you have a data, you can fucking model it."
452660,459340," One of the things you can model is basically the probability of the next word in a sentence."
460900,461540," Why not?"
461540,463720," You can make a mathematical model out of that."
463720,470420," So, you have a sentence, and you can make a huge mathematical model that tries to predict the next sentence, the next word in the sentence."
470420,473580," And then you can repeat the process, and you can get ChatGPT."
474040,484160," So, there is a direct connection with nerds sitting in a feral industrial plant and people in OpenAI creating ChatGPT."
484160,485420," They're using the same process."
485420,488160," They're literally using the same process, actually."
490580,497220," And this is what we're going to try to explore today."
497220,505080," We're going to try to just take that approach of, essentially, I want to model something, but I don't have a model."
505080,514140," Can we come up with an algorithm that, given how the model is supposed to behave, give me that actual model?"
514140,516980," Can we come up with something like that?"
516980,519040," We'll just explore that entire idea."
519040,525280," We're going to start with this very abstract idea and see where we can go, and see where we can go."
525280,528000," So, that's basically the plan for today's stream."
528000,529420," I hope it's going to be interesting."
529420,532680," So, we've got some subs, I suppose."
532680,535260," So, let me see what we've got."
535260,538840," So, thank you so much, the Redcore with Twitch Prime."
538840,539680," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
539680,544500," It was two days ago, but since Twitch shows me that, I want to acknowledge that."
545340,549260," Valini, thank you so much for 23 months of Tier 1 subscription."
549260,550220," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
550220,553700," FabioHBF, thank you so much for Tier 1 subscription."
553700,556680," OrmusBaxter, thank you so much for Twitch Prime."
556680,559520," AndrewZero, thank you so much for 1GiftedSubs."
559520,563800," And AkiXD underscore underscore, thank you so much for Twitch Prime subscription."
564340,570740," And AisLeo, thank you so much for wasting a shit ton of money to Jeffrey Bezos, because I'm not going to get any of that, ever."
570740,573360," But thank you so much for 100 community subs."
573360,578300," That just means that 100 people have an opportunity to speak in our Discord server."
578300,582920," Right, because once you get subbed, you actually can talk in a Discord server."
583040,589020," So now 100 more people can say something there, right, and maybe have a beautiful time."
589020,598420," Because a lot of people say who have a voice in our Discord server that our Discord server is actually quite pleasant to talk in."
598420,599740," Because it's very calm."
599740,604800," Because it's closed, actually, it's not as crazy as other Discord servers, right?"
605020,609140," So it's actually very, like, very much isolated its own cultural bubble."
609140,611800," And that's what makes it sort of nice, right?"
611800,612620," Because it's closed."
612620,615820," But now 100 people can experience that."
615820,616920," Thank you."
616920,622780," Thank you so much for wasting so much money, but making 100 people, you know, more happy."
622780,623340," Hopefully."
623340,623980," I don't know."
623980,624480," We'll see."
624480,626320," It depends."
626320,628560," But you can also use emotes now as well."
628560,634440," So anyway, let's take a look."
635780,640300," So there was a very interesting example that I actually saw some time ago."
640300,647240," I would like to credit the author of that example, but I can't really seem to find that."
647240,655640," But just keep in mind that this example of machine learning, or rather, hello world of machine learning, I didn't come up with that example myself, right?"
655640,656820," So just keep that in mind."
656820,658520," So let's create a C program."
658520,660080," We're going to be using C, by the way, right?"
660080,664320," We're not going to use any fancy frameworks or any libraries or anything like that."
664600,666240," We don't really need that for now."
666240,668400," We're only learning the principles."
668400,669860," Right."
669860,672520," So we're going to start like from fundamentals."
672520,674560," Like it's a very much fundamental stream."
674560,679180," We're going to use libc and just C, at least for now."
679180,679720," Right."
679800,681420," So we're not going to use anything else."
681420,684000," Actually, we're going to also use libmath, right?"
684000,687100," Because we're going to use some of the mathematical functions, but we'll see."
687100,688800," We'll see how it goes."
688800,690460," I'm going to start with the hello world."
690460,691260," All right."
691260,692580," We're going to start with the hello world."
694220,694580," Okay."
694580,695640," So I'm going to return zero."
695640,700320," And I'm going to say something like, hello, seaman."
700320,701680," Right."
703140,711300," And let me maybe create a build.sh, build.sh, which is going to build the event."
712780,719840," So bnsh and let's use clang and let's compile it down to an executable."
719840,725580," So I probably also want to enable all the warnings and all of the extra warnings just in case."
726380,729760," And I'm going to make this entire thing executable."
729760,731880," So let's actually run it."
731880,737980," And actually, I want to enable the tracing so I can see what exactly it is running."
737980,739920," So it shows the command, as you can see."
739920,743300," And if we run this entire thing, it says, hello, seaman."
743300,744320," Okay."
744320,748120," So let's train a very simple model, right?"
748120,755340," Let's train a very simple model that is trying to predict some number based on the input number, right?"
755340,758500," So let's actually create a training set, right?"
758500,762640," So we're going to have a train and it's going to be an array of pairs of numbers."
762640,766220," So the first number is going to be the input of the model."
766220,769980," And the second number is what we expect from the model, right?"
769980,771860," Very simple model, right?"
771860,774400," One number in, one number out."
774400,777400," And it's not predicting your age based on your age, no."
777400,780680," Have you guys seen that meme?"
781740,791420," There was a meme floating around on YouTube is that somebody was making like a neural network that predicts your age based on your age, right?"
791420,797240," And it was actually performing with 98% of success."
797940,804420," So in 98% of the cases, it would actually predict your age correctly based on the given age."
804420,805740," We're not going to be doing that."
805740,809440," So, but actually very close, believe it or not."
809440,810340," Actually very close."
811740,817340," So essentially, if you are supplying zero, right?"
817340,821960," If you supply zero, the model is supposed to respond with zero, right?"
821960,826720," If you supply one, it's supposed to respond with two."
826720,829160," Very interesting model, isn't it?"
829220,833340," All right, so if you provide two, it's supposed to return four."
833340,838540," If you supply three, it's supposed to return six."
838540,843960," If you supply four, what would it return if you supply four?"
843960,846380," What it will return?"
846380,846940," Who knows?"
846940,851440," Eight."
851440,853280," It will return eight."
853500,855720," It's kind of obvious what this model is doing."
855720,861200," It's kind of, you can see that it just multiplies the number by two, right?"
861200,867140," But let's imagine that the actual training data is immensely complex."
867140,870920," It's like a missed, like, data set of handwritten numbers."
870920,873540," We don't fucking know any patterns in the data."
873540,874680," We don't fucking understand it."
874680,875520," It's so enormous."
875520,876680," It has so many parameters."
876680,877500," Holy shit."
877500,879380," We don't know how to model this kind of shit."
879380,881260," Like, we literally don't know."
881260,882600," Like, that's the data we've got."
882600,885840," And our boss said, like, model that, predict the next of the numbers."
885840,886980," We don't fucking know what to do."
886980,887520," What the fuck?"
887520,890360," If we don't do that tomorrow, we're going to get fired."
890360,898600," So, the only thing we know about this model, right, is that it has roughly a form, right?"
898600,906840," Roughly a form of the output number y is equal to x multiplied by w, where x is the input."
906840,914260," And w is some sort of a number, some sort of a number, the parameter of our model, right?"
914260,918460," So, here's basically the gist of machine learning."
918460,922680," This is your model, this is your model, and this is your training set."
922680,930720," But all of that is reduced, is compressed to very basic, very simple example, as simple as possible."
930720,937380," But the same approach applies even if you have more parameters in here, more inputs and more outputs in here."
937380,941600," And it still applies if you have immensely more complicated formula in here."
941600,949600," In fact, the formula may consist of millions and billions of parameters in here."
949600,950520," Sometimes trillions."
950920,954560," Like, GPT-4 is like a trillion of parameters."
954560,957840," Like, imagine a formula with trillion of parameters."
957840,960080," A formula with trillion of parameters."
960080,961120," Do you know what is a trillion?"
961120,961460," Okay."
961460,963200," So, here is the thousand."
963200,965680," So, thousand is three zeros."
965680,969880," Another three zeros is million."
969880,971400," Right."
971400,974780," Another three zeros is billion."
975560,979840," And trillion is thousands of billions."
979840,982840," Thousands of billions."
982840,988500," Imagine a formula with thousands of billions parameters."
988500,992000," Like, it's unimaginable."
992000,992940," You can't imagine it."
992940,997340," It's like trying to imagine like a black hole in the center of Milky Way."
997340,1000680," Like, you can just, like, show a comparison and stuff like that."
1000680,1002900," But our brain is just incapable of imagining that."
1002900,1004260," It's just like you cannot imagine that."
1004940,1008280," But anyway, we're going to focus on something that is one."
1008280,1009700," So, GPT-4, right?"
1009700,1012120," GPT-4 is this."
1012120,1013960," And this is us."
1013960,1020180," We're going to compress this entire shit to just one parameter."
1020180,1021820," Like, it's just going to be one parameter."
1021820,1022500," Because why not?"
1022500,1024480," So, yeah."
1024480,1025980," Okay."
1025980,1029220," And essentially, we don't really know what is this parameter."
1029220,1029560," All right."
1029560,1031100," So, let me actually bring back the formula."
1031100,1032640," I don't know why the fuck I removed it."
1032640,1034360," Right."
1034560,1035920," We don't really know what it is."
1035920,1038880," So, we're probably going to start with some sort of a random number."
1038880,1041320," Unfortunately, in C, random numbers."
1041320,1042380," You can only have integers."
1042380,1044840," But we can code something like random float."
1044840,1046080," Right."
1046080,1047880," So, we can code something like random float."
1047880,1052000," Which, let's say, it's going to act like a JavaScript float."
1052220,1057140," JavaScript rand, which returns the value from 0 to 1."
1057140,1058320," Let's actually quickly code that."
1058320,1058660," Right."
1058660,1060640," So, it's going to be something like rand float."
1060640,1062240," Right."
1062240,1064560," And essentially, here's the thing."
1064920,1075760," So, rand, by itself, returns a random number from 0 to a value, to a constant value, which is called rand max or max rand."
1075760,1076760," I can never remember."
1076760,1077120," Right."
1077340,1083300," But essentially, if it's max rand, the compiler will tell me, so I can easily fix that."
1083300,1089960," And essentially, what we can do, we can cast this entire thing to a flow and then divide by rand max."
1090160,1092080," We can also cast it to a flow just in case."
1092080,1098000," And this will effectively, automatically give us a random number from 0 to 1."
1098000,1098580," Right."
1098580,1102500," And we're going to initialize our model with a random number from 0 to 1."
1102500,1102840," Right."
1102840,1104300," So, this is basically what we're going to do."
1104300,1105720," Right."
1105720,1107140," We're going to put this thing in here."
1107140,1112180," And let's actually try to rebuild this entire thing and see."
1112180,1113240," Right."
1113240,1115440," So, rand max, it doesn't have rand."
1115440,1117860," So, this is because I need to include stdlib."
1117860,1119260," Right."
1119460,1120320," So, and there we go."
1120320,1123400," So, this is the random number from 0 to 1."
1123400,1129680," But it's the same because we're using the same seed for a random number generator."
1129680,1130040," Right."
1130040,1131580," Because we don't really initialize it."
1131580,1133460," That's why it's always the same."
1133460,1134020," Right."
1134020,1140520," So, one of the things we can do, we can try to initialize the random number generator with the current time."
1140520,1143280," So, every time it's going to be different."
1143280,1145040," See that gotcha hyper."
1145040,1147560," Thank you so much."
1147560,1149220," That's exactly what we're going to be doing."
1149320,1150560," We're going to be seeding it."
1150560,1151260," Right."
1151260,1152260," So, I'm going to provide the time."
1152260,1154760," And let's go."
1154760,1155160," Right."
1155160,1157380," So, as you can see, it is different every time."
1157380,1161960," Maybe we actually want to have like a random number from 0 to 10."
1161960,1162580," Who knows?"
1162580,1163300," Right."
1163300,1166060," Let's actually say it's going to be from 0 to 10."
1166600,1167940," And there we go."
1167940,1168800," That should work."
1168800,1172060," So, it gives us random number from 0 to 10."
1172060,1181760," But maybe, even though we want it to be random, maybe for sort of like educational purposes, we're going to fixate it to something like 69."
1181760,1182300," Right."
1182420,1186980," So, but seeding it differently every time would be useful in the future."
1186980,1187340," Right."
1187340,1188380," It will be useful in the future."
1188380,1189420," So, I'm going to keep it in here."
1189420,1191980," But for now, I'm going to just fixate it to this."
1191980,1192740," Right."
1192940,1201240," So, we now need to find the value of W that actually satisfies this data."
1201240,1206680," But to know that it satisfies this data, we need to actually measure that somehow."
1206680,1213780," How can we measure how well this parameter of the model satisfies that specific data?"
1213780,1221200," We can just iterate through the inputs of the data and compare the results with expected results."
1221200,1222460," Right."
1222580,1223920," We can just like do that."
1223920,1224400," Right."
1224400,1225820," So, let's just see."
1225820,1230580," Let's just see how well that specific model fits our data."
1230580,1231740," Does it even fit it all?"
1231740,1233420," Does it return the same shit or not?"
1233420,1234440," I don't fucking know."
1234440,1235400," Let's find out."
1235400,1239560," Like, remember, we know nothing about the data and nothing about the model."
1239560,1239820," Right."
1239820,1241040," So, we can tweak the parameters."
1241040,1243320," So, we'll just see how well does it perform."
1243320,1243660," Right."
1243660,1245120," I'm going to iterate through all of the data."
1245120,1249380," It would be nice to have the count for the training data."
1249380,1251480," So, let's actually introduce something like train count."
1252220,1259220," which basically takes size of the train, right, and divides it by the size of a single element of train."
1259220,1261660," So, effectively, this is what you have to do in C."
1261660,1266420," Effectively, it will give you the amount of elements in here."
1266420,1266680," Right."
1266740,1267640," So, the amount of elements."
1267640,1270360," So, you can do something like train count."
1270360,1271260," Right."
1271260,1272400," And what we can do in here."
1272400,1272780," Right."
1272780,1274420," So, we have an input."
1274420,1277700," Input is basically train I zero."
1277700,1278420," Right."
1278420,1279980," So, this is a train I zero."
1279980,1284980," So, then we basically feed that value into our model."
1284980,1285400," Right."
1285520,1290140," So, and we basically do y equal to x multiplied by w."
1290140,1291260," There we go."
1291260,1292800," So, our model is a single number."
1292800,1297000," We just feed that input data into the model and we get the output."
1297420,1303620," And we need to answer the question, is y equal to what we actually expect in here?"
1303620,1305300," Is it equal to that?"
1305300,1306500," I don't freaking know."
1306500,1309140," One of the things we can do, we can just look at them."
1309140,1309480," Right."
1310180,1319640," So, we can say that actual is this, but expected is actually this."
1319640,1320160," Right."
1320160,1321340," So, something like this."
1321340,1322460," There we go."
1322460,1325460," So, I'm going to remove this entire thing."
1325460,1328840," And let's see what we have."
1328840,1329900," Right."
1329900,1335500," So, essentially, the actual value for the first input was zero and expected zero."
1335500,1336680," So, everything works fine."
1336680,1339380," So, then an actual was seven."
1340180,1341140," Far off."
1341140,1341940," Completely far off."
1341940,1343940," But the expected was one."
1343940,1346020," And as you can see, it doesn't perform well."
1346020,1347520," It returns garbage."
1347520,1349740," It literally returns garbage."
1349740,1351000," Like, what the fuck is this model?"
1351000,1352500," We're going to get fired tomorrow."
1352500,1353940," Right."
1353940,1359740," So, let's actually have a measure of how bad this thing performs."
1359740,1365780," So, the way it's usually measured is with the sort of like average square."
1365780,1366440," Right."
1366440,1368660," I think that's how it's called."
1368660,1368940," Right."
1368940,1369500," Average square."
1369500,1373940," So, essentially, you find the distance between actual and expected."
1373940,1374280," Right."
1374280,1376080," So, you subtract the actual."
1376080,1378420," And, by the way, am I an idiot?"
1378420,1379320," Yes."
1379320,1380140," I am an idiot."
1380140,1381640," I'm supposed to put one in here."
1381640,1386940," I'm supposed to put one in here."
1386940,1387160," Yeah."
1387160,1387520," There we go."
1387520,1389160," It's supposed to be two, four, and six."
1389160,1391520," But, I mean, you get the idea."
1391520,1393620," Already hallucinating."
1395240,1397180," We haven't even trained anything."
1397180,1399400," But, we already hallucinating."
1399400,1400300," Isn't it cool?"
1400300,1404300," And, yeah."
1404300,1405960," Our model is already closer."
1405960,1406280," Right."
1406280,1406880," That's right."
1406880,1410280," Our model is already way closer than it was before."
1410280,1412180," We just had to use the right data."
1413260,1413780," Okay."
1413780,1419620," So, essentially, what we want, like a square mean error or something like that."
1419620,1426320," Unfortunately, I'm not an AI or specialist or mathematician, so I don't really know the fancy words."
1426520,1434580," I'm ooga-booga software developer, so I just brute force, ooga-booga, brute force, brute force."
1434580,1435620," That's what I know."
1435620,1440120," So, and that's what we're going to be doing today."
1440120,1442780," So, we want to find the difference between these things."
1442780,1446640," So, y minus the actual expected input, right?"
1446640,1449140," So, and this is sort of like the distance between them."
1450000,1459080," And, what you do, right, what you do, you basically accumulate the squares of those distances, right?"
1459080,1461260," So, you accumulate the squares of those distances."
1461260,1462640," Why squares specifically?"
1462640,1470080," So, the square actually has a very interesting property, is that if this distance is negative, it doesn't really matter."
1470080,1472880," Negative by negative is going to be positive, so it's always positive."
1472880,1474060," That's one thing."
1474060,1479100," And, another thing is that any error is sort of amplified, right?"
1479180,1487480," Even if you have, like, a little bit of an error, it's going to be amplified by the square, so something off is going to be instantly visible, right?"
1487480,1492260," Something, like, far off is instantly visible, and that's one of the reasons why people square."
1492260,1496680," Can you, like, you know, cube it to amplify it even more?"
1496680,1497760," Is that useful?"
1497760,1502080," And people also in the chat say that the square is steeper, all right?"
1502080,1507620," I don't really know the actual reason, but this is how I think about it, right?"
1507700,1510560," So, you sort of kind of amplify it, right?"
1510560,1512280," And a cube is going to be non-zero, right?"
1512280,1514420," So, with a cube, it's going to be kind of dangerous."
1514420,1516340," It could be negative and stuff like that."
1516340,1521200," For me, for my ooga-booga software development brain, it serves two purposes."
1521200,1524020," Basically, acting like an absolute, right?"
1524020,1527000," So, I could have just, like, do ABS somewhere in here, right?"
1527000,1530460," But on top of that, it also amplifies any errors, right?"
1530460,1532800," So, that's how my ooga-booga brain sees it."
1532800,1536100," I might be incorrect, and I'm totally fine with that, right?"
1536100,1544020," So, and after that, you want to actually kind of find the average of this entire error, right?"
1544020,1548980," So, after that, you want to divide it by the amount of the training data."
1548980,1552040," So, actually, let's divide it by the training count."
1552040,1558280," And this is sort of, like, our measure how badly this model performs, right?"
1558280,1564540," If the value is big, that means it actually performs really badly."
1564540,1570420," So, if it's equal to zero, that means it performs exactly as we expected."
1570420,1573520," It fits that specific data perfectly."
1573940,1578200," And because of that, there is another interesting problem in machine learning called overfitting."
1578200,1580880," But we're not going to be talking about that, right?"
1580880,1587560," But basically, overfitting is that when your model fits the data perfectly, but fails to predict any new data,"
1587560,1592700," it only focuses on the training data and does not recognize anything else outside of the training data."
1592700,1594340," So, this is a very common problem."
1594340,1596400," There's different ways of combating it."
1596400,1598460," But this is something to keep in mind, right?"
1598460,1601020," So, you usually don't want to overfit your model, right?"
1602300,1605520," So, let's actually print this entire thing, right?"
1605520,1608460," So, let's actually print and see what's going to happen, right?"
1608460,1609280," So, we're going to do that."
1609280,1611740," This is how badly our model performs."
1611740,1613040," It's fucking horrible."
1613040,1615340," It's freaking horrible."
1615340,1616800," Right."
1616800,1622260," And this entire thing is usually called cost function, right?"
1622260,1624840," It is usually called cost function."
1624840,1627680," So, let's actually maybe factor it out to a separate function."
1627680,1633460," So, we can just always, at any point, measure the cost of our model, right?"
1633460,1634380," Does it perform well?"
1634380,1635360," Does it perform badly?"
1635360,1636100," I don't know."
1636100,1640320," Let's actually have a single thing that we have in here."
1640320,1642340," It's also known as loss function."
1642340,1644600," There are different names, right?"
1644600,1646860," But for some reason, I kind of like to call it cost function."
1646860,1649440," I kind of could use to call it like that."
1649440,1651020," So, if it's wrong, please tell me."
1651480,1653880," So, and as an input, we can accept the model, right?"
1653880,1658080," So, we are accepting the entire model, and the entire model is literally one parameter."
1658080,1661220," And we're going to be just computing this entire stuff, right?"
1661220,1663060," So, I'm going to just copy-paste it in here."
1663060,1665080," Right."
1665080,1667020," And I'm going to return all that."
1667020,1671600," So, let me now get rid of this entire thing."
1671600,1674960," And here, I can just do cost double name, right?"
1674960,1676060," Okay, cool."
1676560,1677860," So, here's an interesting thing."
1677860,1685000," What we can do with this thing, our goal is to actually drive the cost function to zero, right?"
1685000,1693880," We want to minimize it, because the closer it is to zero, the better the model behaves on that specific training data, right?"
1693880,1695200," So, that's basically what it is."
1695200,1700740," The only thing we can do, we can modify the one single parameter that we have."
1700740,1702460," What we can do?"
1702460,1705900," We can just, like, wiggle it around, I suppose, right?"
1705900,1710420," So, let's actually take, like, a very small value, like, epsilon of some sort."
1710420,1713720," Like, it's going to be very small, like, maybe one thousandth."
1713720,1717520," And let's just try to, like, gently shift."
1717520,1720860," Just gently shift the parameter."
1720860,1725000," And see how, like, it changes the performance of the model."
1725000,1726060," Right."
1726060,1727280," So, let's see."
1727280,1730660," Is it going to perform, like, better or worse?"
1730660,1731640," I don't fucking know."
1731640,1732640," Let's find out."
1732640,1733740," Let's find out."
1734320,1736500," And it actually started to perform worse."
1736500,1738560," So, we made the model worse."
1738560,1740340," What the fuck?"
1740340,1742120," So, we're going to get fired tomorrow."
1742120,1743380," All right."
1743380,1745720," Let's try to wiggle it in a different direction, maybe."
1745720,1746180," All right."
1746180,1747980," So, okay."
1752340,1763680," What if we, like, continue doing that?"
1763680,1768500," It kind of gets better and better."
1768500,1770720," What if we, okay, okay."
1770720,1773080," What if we automate that process?"
1773080,1773640," Right."
1773640,1774980," What if we automate the process?"
1774980,1775340," Right."
1776260,1786020," So, essentially, one of the things we can do, we can treat cost function as sort of like a mathematical function."
1786020,1786520," Right."
1786520,1790220," So, and mathematical functions usually have some sort of optimum."
1790220,1790540," Right."
1790620,1795580," So, if you take a look at the parabola, parabola, right."
1795580,1802520," So, I wonder if I can, okay, parabola."
1806900,1809080," I want to get this thing."
1809080,1811500," All right."
1811500,1816680," Let's imagine that this parabola is our, basically, cost function."
1816680,1820320," And we are currently somewhere on that parabola."
1821160,1828800," So, essentially, if we take the derivative of that function, right, the derivative of the function,"
1828800,1832280," it will tell us in which direction the function grows."
1832280,1835720," Lotus rect."
1835720,1838080," Shut up."
1838080,1840140," All right."
1840140,1843440," So, yeah."
1843440,1846880," So, it will give us the direction in which this entire thing grows."
1846880,1849140," Right."
1849260,1853280," And what you have to do, you essentially have to move in the opposite direction."
1853280,1857080," If you move it in the opposite direction of which, where the function grows,"
1857080,1859080," you're going to be actually moving towards the minimum,"
1859080,1860820," and you're going to get stuck in there."
1860820,1862280," Right."
1862280,1868000," And that raises the question, how do we get the derivative of this?"
1868000,1870480," This is like a for loops and stuff like that."
1870480,1872740," So, it is possible."
1872740,1879100," We can probably convert it to like a mathematical function with the sum and like differences and stuff like that."
1879260,1884260," Find the derivative of this entire thing and then just like move in an opposite direction of derivative."
1884260,1889420," But this is just like, this is a shit for nerds, right?"
1889700,1893880," So, we're Chad artificial intelligence bros."
1893880,1895680," That's who we are."
1895680,1900600," We're here to create the startup that's going to be bought by Microsoft."
1900600,1905220," We got no time to this nerdy fucking shit of derivatives."
1905640,1907280," Like, what the fuck is this?"
1907280,1908340," Mattresses?"
1908340,1909460," Derivatives?"
1909460,1911700," This is a shit for nerds."
1911700,1915900," What's surprising is actually, by the way, is that in neural networks,"
1915900,1921860," you have to work with matrices and derivatives simultaneously."
1921860,1925140," This is such a fucking irony."
1925140,1926560," People keep complaining."
1926800,1928820," Why are we learning all of that in school?"
1928820,1930340," Because where do I need that?"
1930340,1938140," Literally, the most successful discipline on planet Earth involves matrices and derivatives simultaneously."
1938140,1940420," Fucking simultaneously."
1940420,1942140," This is the irony."
1942140,1945700," But anyway, we're not going to be doing that."
1945700,1946500," Right."
1946500,1948320," So, there is a very interesting thing."
1948320,1952060," Do you know the definition of derivative?"
1952660,1952820," Right."
1952820,1954980," So, let's actually find the definition of derivative."
1954980,1957580," Definition of derivative."
1957580,1959500," Right."
1959500,1960380," Definition of derivative."
1960380,1966260," So, I probably want to use Google."
1966260,1974200," So, I just want to open Wikipedia."
1974200,1981300," There we go."
1981460,1983240," This is a very good definition of derivative."
1983240,1985180," If I do say so myself."
1985180,1986280," No, I didn't come up with that."
1986280,1986980," Right."
1986980,1989480," Essentially, you have this, like, H."
1989480,1990320," Right."
1990320,1991980," You have this H."
1991980,1995720," And this is a difference between the input of the function."
1995720,1997240," So, here is your function."
1997240,1997680," Right."
1997680,2001220," And you wiggle the input parameter by H."
2001220,2004000," And you subtract the input parameter without the H."
2004000,2006280," And you divide it by that small wiggle."
2006280,2007440," Right."
2007740,2013240," And what's interesting is that then you drive that small little difference towards zero."
2013240,2018620," And this entire thing basically slowly morphs into the derivatives."
2018620,2023620," And basically gives you the direction of the function where it is growing."
2023620,2028900," So, we literally take, like, the value of the function and divide it by, like, this distance"
2028900,2030340," that we traveled with the argument."
2030340,2033120," And we get the velocity of this entire function."
2033120,2033680," Right."
2033780,2039040," And since the function is continuous, we have to, sort of, like, drive this distance towards"
2039040,2039480," zero."
2039480,2039860," Right."
2039860,2042080," So, because of the continuousness of the function."
2042080,2043980," But we're working with computers."
2043980,2045000," Computers are discrete."
2045000,2049480," Who said that we have to do that in a mathematical way?"
2049480,2052500," What if we literally take our stupid epsilon?"
2052500,2053040," Right."
2053180,2055280," So, literally take our stupid epsilon."
2055280,2056120," Right."
2056120,2063600," And I literally code this formula minus this thing without the epsilon and divide it by epsilon."
2064980,2071660," And this is the distance of the cost function, which I have to sub-subtract from the inside."
2071660,2083880," I can't imagine, like, an actual AI or, like, specialist or mathematicians in the chat fucking just screaming at me."
2083880,2085800," Like, what the fuck are you doing?"
2085800,2088000," You fucking stupid software developer."
2088000,2089400," What the fuck is this shit?"
2089400,2093580," In fact, it is a well-known method called finite difference."
2093580,2095900," Finite difference."
2095900,2096740," Right."
2096740,2101520," This is not something that is actually used in machine learning."
2101520,2102420," Keep in mind."
2102420,2103100," Right."
2103100,2105240," So, this is not something that you want to do."
2105240,2109420," But this is something that you can do when you're learning."
2109420,2109800," Right."
2109800,2113700," Because we're trying to understand what exactly we're trying to achieve."
2113700,2114260," Right."
2114260,2115580," What exactly we're trying to achieve."
2115580,2116640," We have a function."
2116640,2121800," And we're trying to find where the function is at zero, at its minimum."
2121800,2122460," Right."
2122460,2123520," So, how we can do that?"
2123520,2124640," We can look left."
2124640,2125700," We can look right."
2125700,2128940," Where is the best direction?"
2128940,2130340," Let's go in that direction."
2130340,2131840," Let's keep going in that direction."
2131840,2133060," You can do that in different ways."
2133060,2133960," Right."
2133960,2135600," But this is not the most optimal way."
2135600,2137260," So, this is called finite differences."
2137260,2138760," Right."
2138760,2142360," So, here it is."
2142360,2142760," Literally."
2142760,2143820," Right."
2144480,2148580," So, finite differences is a mathematical expression of the form of something like this, roughly."
2148580,2149940," Right."
2150100,2153720," So, and it's usually used for approximation of derivatives."
2153720,2154300," Right."
2154300,2156440," So, if you don't like derivatives."
2156440,2157080," Right."
2157080,2163200," If you were traumatized by educational system and don't like derivatives, you can approximate them very easily."
2163200,2164720," Right."
2164720,2169420," And it actually kind of works even on functions that are not differentiable."
2169420,2170340," But don't quote me on that."
2170380,2171980," I don't know anything about mathematics."
2171980,2172460," Right."
2172460,2177860," So, because you don't even need to know the structure of the function."
2177860,2186120," Usually, if you want to take a derivative of the function, you just like look up this cheat sheet of different like functions and what how the derivative looks like."
2186120,2192320," In this case, you can just like plug different values to the function and find the difference and divide it by the epsilon."
2192600,2193240," So, you're good to go."
2193240,2194720," You approximate it kind of."
2194720,2199860," And the smaller your epsilon becomes, the better approximation you have."
2199860,2200220," Right."
2200220,2202900," So, and yeah."
2202900,2203600," Let's actually see."
2203600,2206580," Let's actually see what is going to happen."
2206580,2206900," Right."
2206900,2208480," So, here is the cost function."
2209760,2214360," Before we update it, like with dcost."
2214360,2214740," Right."
2214740,2215760," And this is after."
2215760,2219040," Did the cost function improve?"
2219040,2219940," Right."
2219940,2221380," Did the cost function improve?"
2221380,2223260," No."
2223260,2225260," It actually became worse."
2225260,2228600," I wonder why though."
2228600,2231480," I wonder why though."
2231480,2237220," And it's probably, let's actually try to print this entire value and see."
2237220,2238700," Maybe it's actually huge."
2238700,2239720," Who knows?"
2239860,2241100," Maybe it's actually huge."
2241100,2241980," D cost."
2241980,2243420," Actually, yeah."
2243420,2244700," We're supposed to do plus."
2244700,2245240," I'm an idiot."
2245240,2245640," Right."
2245640,2246840," So, we're supposed to do plus."
2246840,2248400," But let's print it nonetheless."
2248400,2249820," So, that was the problem."
2249820,2253100," The problem is that I put minus in here, but it's supposed to be plus usually."
2253100,2254160," Right."
2254160,2255920," But let's take a look at that thing."
2255920,2259040," So, the cost is 61."
2259040,2259500," Right."
2259500,2260680," So, that kind of should work."
2260680,2261620," But it's too huge."
2261620,2262000," Right."
2262000,2262400," You see?"
2262400,2264340," It's kind of too huge."
2264340,2269300," So, you're going to be jumping around too much if you try to do this kind of stuff."
2269480,2269660," Right."
2269660,2272560," So, it doesn't really work that well."
2272560,2273640," Right."
2273640,2279260," And the thing that people usually do in machine learning, they introduce..."
2279260,2279460," Yeah."
2279460,2280600," People already guessed it."
2280600,2280760," Yeah."
2280800,2283240," They introduce a thing called learning rate."
2283240,2285400," Because even if you use derivatives."
2285400,2286040," Right."
2286040,2288500," Even if you use derivatives for this kind of thing."
2288500,2289900," Right."
2289900,2290780," They're going to be..."
2290780,2298180," Their actual values are still going to be too big for just driving your value towards zero."
2298180,2299300," They're still going to be too big."
2299300,2305380," You want to kind of like, you know, make them smaller so they don't overshoot or anything like that."
2305720,2310180," And the rate, we can set the rate to also very small value like a one-thousands."
2310180,2312520," And here's the fun part."
2312520,2315880," Here's the fun part of machine learning."
2315880,2320260," There is a lot of magical values like that."
2320260,2322300," There is a lot."
2322680,2325940," And basically doing machine learning, artificial intelligence and stuff like that."
2325940,2330080," It's just like playing with this magical number until the data looks right."
2330080,2333360," XKCD even has like a comic on that."
2333360,2334560," XKCD."
2334560,2336220," Machine learning."
2336220,2337520," Do you guys remember?"
2341100,2342840," I guess that's the one."
2342840,2344560," Right."
2344560,2345560," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2345560,2349980," So, this is basically like a pile of linear algebra and stuff like that."
2349980,2352020," This is your machine learning system."
2352020,2352520," Yep."
2352520,2357500," You pour the data into this big pile of linear algebra and then collect the answers on the other side."
2357500,2359160," What if the answers are wrong?"
2359160,2362000," Just stir the pile until they start to look right."
2362000,2363660," So, yeah."
2363660,2365420," That's exactly what you're going to be doing."
2365420,2367940," And you won't believe this is not even a joke."
2369140,2371180," That's literally how you do that."
2371180,2371920," Right."
2371920,2373500," That's literally how you do that."
2373500,2385680," And what's funny is that this is the fact that when you work with like ChatGPT or any, you know, models that generate art and something like that."
2385680,2389160," They not always work right away."
2389160,2389900," Right."
2389900,2396960," And if they don't work, which you usually do, you just try again until they kind of produce the reasonable result."
2397320,2401640," The fact that you work with these artificial intelligence models like that is not coincidental."
2401640,2407960," Because that thing stems from the fundamentals of the approach in the first place."
2407960,2415300," It is fundamental to machine learning to just like fuck around until it works right."
2415360,2417620," And that's why the results also end up like that."
2417620,2421900," ChatGPT gives you something that looks right, but not quite right."
2421900,2422980," And you just try again."
2422980,2425060," And it stems from the fundamental."
2425060,2425520," Right."
2425520,2428400," It goes from the bottom of this entire thing."
2428400,2429320," Right."
2432040,2435940," But what's funny is that when it starts to look right, it kind of works."
2435940,2437720," That's what's surprising about it."
2437720,2438000," Right."
2438000,2448000," Which is why it's not good for people that have no idea about the subject."
2448000,2448300," Yeah."
2448300,2449600," That's very dangerous."
2449600,2450460," Right."
2450560,2454740," So, to use this kind of stuff effectively, you kind of need to know what you're doing."
2454740,2455200," Right."
2455200,2455840," Unfortunately."
2455840,2459740," But at the same time, this thing encourages you not to know what you're doing."
2459740,2463440," Which is a very dangerous thing."
2463440,2463860," But anyway."
2463860,2464580," So."
2464580,2466260," Okay."
2466640,2470320," So, essentially, that improved the cost function."
2470320,2475600," And what's interesting is that if we will need to move in a different direction,"
2475600,2480240," this particular formula will take that into account automatically."
2480240,2483760," It will just take that into account automatically."
2483760,2484600," That's the beauty of it."
2484600,2489760," And now, what if we just repeat this process two times?"
2489760,2490080," Right."
2490080,2491240," We did it once."
2491240,2492900," Let's repeat it two times."
2492900,2493380," Right."
2493380,2493840," Why not?"
2493840,2496440," Let's see."
2496540,2497020," What's going to happen?"
2497020,2498900," Okay."
2498900,2499880," Ah."
2499880,2501660," What the fuck is going on?"
2501660,2503160," Actually, it's supposed to."
2503160,2503540," All right."
2503540,2504920," Yeah."
2504920,2505220," Don't go."
2505220,2508540," So, it decreased even more."
2508540,2509280," Right."
2509280,2510380," It decreased even more."
2510380,2512860," What if we do that, I don't know, five times?"
2512860,2515120," It decreased even more."
2515120,2517600," What if we continue 10 times?"
2517600,2520740," What if we do 100 times?"
2520740,2524280," It keeps decreasing."
2525080,2531760," So, our model starts to perform better and better and better."
2531760,2532880," What if we continue?"
2532880,2533300," What if we continue?"
2533300,2534540," How about 200s?"
2534540,2536440," Okay."
2536440,2537240," Not bad."
2537240,2538560," What about 300s?"
2538560,2541020," It's almost zero."
2541020,2542420," Let's continue."
2542420,2543660," 500 times."
2543660,2545780," It's basically zero."
2546320,2551200," So, let's train it for 500 iterations."
2551200,2555520," Let's train for 500 iterations and print the value of W."
2555520,2560040," It's basically two."
2564040,2569140," So, we successfully trained our model."
2569140,2570740," I would even say not just model."
2570740,2573600," Our neural network with a single neuron."
2573600,2577940," Without using any fancy frameworks."
2577940,2581220," Without using Python, TensorFlow, or GPU."
2581220,2582800," Just using C."
2583280,2587560," We just trained our single last cell brain."
2587560,2594480," This is a perfect title for a stream."
2594480,2596380," Training my last brain cell."
2596380,2602720," Training my last brain cell."
2606760,2607780," Yeah, perceptron."
2607780,2609280," So, almost."
2609280,2610700," We didn't get to the perceptron."
2610700,2613600," But, as you can see, it's not exactly."
2613600,2616020," So, the actual model here."
2616020,2617860," The actual thing in here is."
2617860,2620480," Like, W has to be equal to two."
2620480,2622940," It was obvious from the start."
2622940,2623200," Right."
2623200,2624300," It was obvious from the start."
2624300,2627200," But, we sort of pretended that we didn't know that."
2627200,2627440," Right."
2627500,2629340," So, we sort of pretended that we didn't know that."
2629340,2630780," Right."
2630780,2634140," And, it actually goes towards two."
2634140,2635560," So, here's the interesting thing."
2635560,2636220," Okay."
2636220,2638640," So, we can print the cost."
2638640,2640660," Let's actually say that the cost is equal to that."
2640660,2642680," And, also, along with the cost."
2642680,2644500," Let's print the value of the model."
2644500,2646780," And, see how it sort of approaches to."
2646780,2647440," Right."
2647440,2649120," So, I can print it like that."
2649120,2650440," All right."
2650440,2651440," So, we can clearly see."
2651440,2652960," So, it started from seven."
2652960,2653640," Right."
2653640,2654620," It started from seven."
2654620,2656180," And, it was going down to two."
2656700,2659040," But, what if it started below two?"
2659040,2659860," Right."
2659860,2661200," What if it started below two?"
2661200,2666060," What if instead of this thing, we had something like one?"
2666060,2667720," Would it still work?"
2667720,2669980," Yeah."
2669980,2672680," It started from one."
2672680,2674000," And, it started to approach two."
2674000,2676160," But, it never fully approached it."
2676160,2678020," Because, we didn't fully train it."
2678020,2679480," But, it's still approaching two."
2679480,2682260," So, it is approaching the solution."
2682260,2684320," It is approaching the solution."
2684320,2685020," Right."
2685420,2691760," And, so, what's interesting is that, here, this particular cost function is very simple."
2691760,2694400," But, in case of more data, right."
2694400,2697760," If you have more different data, the cost function becomes even more complicated."
2697760,2701680," And, it can have multiple optimal solutions."
2701680,2702520," Right."
2702920,2705240," So, and, here's the thing."
2705240,2707540," Sometimes, where you start."
2707540,2708020," Right."
2708020,2709580," So, here we start from a random number."
2709580,2713260," Sometimes, where you start is very important."
2713260,2714660," Very important."
2714660,2718520," Because, depending on where you start, you may end up at different optimal solutions."
2718520,2722080," And, that's why, quite often, the mathematical model is randomized."
2722860,2723700," It's randomized."
2723700,2725800," So, if it didn't work one time."
2725800,2730360," And, we're going to observe that, by the way, you know, today, if we have enough time."
2730360,2735680," If it didn't work out, you can just rerun it from a different place."
2735680,2737360," You know, the classical."
2737360,2741200," Just stir the pile of linear algebra until it looks right."
2741200,2746040," So, if it didn't work first time, you can just try it another time in a different state."
2746380,2748340," Until it works out."
2748340,2755220," So, okay, guys."
2755220,2758440," So, and because of that, we kind of want to, you know, do these kind of things."
2758440,2769280," What's funny is that, whatever we have in here, actually, roughly, where is the, I think it's in the cost function."
2770020,2779580," It roughly fits the definition of the single artificial neuron, neuron, single artificial neuron, or perceptron."
2779580,2781320," I think this is how it's called, right?"
2781320,2782340," So, it's a perceptron."
2782340,2784980," Perceptron."
2784980,2785440," Right."
2785440,2786400," So, let's actually Google that."
2786400,2791360," Perceptron."
2793080,2796200," I think, right, a single one."
2796200,2800680," No, it's not the, let's try a different query."
2800680,2802720," Let's try a different prompt."
2802720,2806980," I think, artificial neuron."
2806980,2808280," Yeah."
2808280,2810460," A single neuron."
2810460,2812640," Not neural, but neural."
2812640,2814880," Uh-huh."
2814880,2817100," I need a picture."
2817100,2820000," I need a picture."
2822000,2822420," There we go."
2822420,2824500," There was a better picture."
2824500,2830920," Just let me do, use a Google."
2830920,2836760," It should be illegal to build brains."
2836760,2839040," Oh, this, this is a better one."
2839040,2839460," Finally."
2839460,2841300," Google is better than Dr. Go."
2841300,2844820," Google is better than Dr. Go."
2844820,2847780," Can I, can I open it?"
2847780,2849700," Can, can you just open it?"
2849700,2851580," There we go."
2851920,2852320," What?"
2852320,2854200," Towards data science."
2854200,2855520," I just want a picture."
2855520,2857880," Can, can I have a picture?"
2857880,2862040," I don't know what the fuck is going on"
2862040,2864160," and why everything is so slow to me."
2864160,2865320," I just want a single picture."
2865320,2866000," Finally."
2866000,2866760," Thank you so much."
2866760,2869120," Can I, can I just open it?"
2869120,2869580," Yeah."
2869580,2871840," It's just like this website, they're killing me."
2871840,2872440," Right."
2872440,2874980," The image itself is actually very fast to load."
2874980,2877320," It's just like the front ends are so fucking slow."
2877480,2882520," Anyway, so essentially, okay, I'm sorry for, for, for the lag."
2882520,2883880," Right."
2883880,2886700," So yeah, that's, that's better."
2886700,2893480," So a neural, a neuron, artificial neuron actually have like several inputs, several axes."
2893480,2894220," Right."
2894580,2896460," And they're going towards this neuron."
2896460,2902700," And what it does, it actually sums them up, but it sums them up with a certain weight."
2903180,2906940," So each connection for the input has a certain weight."
2906940,2914740," And essentially, if you have several inputs like X1, X2, X3, and so on and so forth,"
2914740,2920840," and each input is connected with a weight, W1, W2, W3,"
2920840,2924460," and weight is effectively how strong this connection."
2924460,2929760," So what the neuron does, it basically sums them up by multiplying by the weights."
2929760,2930020," Right."
2930020,2937560," So it's going to be X1 multiplied by W1 plus X2 multiplied by W2 plus X3 multiplied by W3,"
2937560,2940960," and so on and so forth, and so on and so forth."
2940960,2949520," So you can effectively think about our model as a single artificial neuron with a single input"
2949520,2951200," and a single connection."
2951720,2959660," So on top of like having several connections, neurons usually also have something called bias."
2959660,2964960," And bias is an additional thing that sort of like shifts the value of the neuron,"
2964960,2968000," like the entire value of the neuron, like to the left or to the right,"
2968000,2971600," to the negative value or to the positive value or something like that."
2971600,2973760," And it's not dependent on the inputs."
2973760,2974260," Right."
2974300,2976800," So it's one value that is usually not dependent on the input."
2976800,2979300," I don't really understand what its purpose,"
2979300,2982720," but apparently people say that it's important to have a bias"
2982720,2985720," because it just improves the performance of the neural networks in general."
2985720,2986300," Right."
2986300,2990020," So you can think of it as like B, and essentially how you use it,"
2990020,2992420," you just like add it to the entire sum."
2992420,2993240," Right."
2993360,2998640," So, yeah, so you can think about our model of Y equal X multiplied by W"
2998640,3003280," as just like a single neuron, single neuron with a single connection,"
3003280,3008100," with the weight of that connection W, and with the bias equal being equal to zero."
3008100,3009580," So bias is equal to zero."
3009580,3010920," So this is basically that."
3010920,3013940," We could have introduced the bias in here, right?"
3013940,3017780," We could have introduced the bias like so."
3017780,3021380," And now our model have two parameters, right?"
3021440,3026300," So it has two parameters, which we can also try to train, right?"
3026300,3030360," So we can initially start with the bias also equal to maybe something like five."
3030360,3031820," Right."
3031820,3035760," And here, one of the things we'll have to do, right?"
3035760,3042420," So here, as you can see, we basically find the difference when we modify the weight,"
3042420,3044580," but we're going to keep the bias as usual."
3044580,3049360," So that gives us the expected difference in the DW, in the weight."
3049860,3050260," Right."
3050260,3053440," And then we can try to modify the bias as well."
3053440,3054220," Right."
3054220,3058980," And that gives us the difference, the expected like difference for the bias."
3058980,3063520," And effectively, what we did in here, we computed a gradient of the two-dimensional function."
3063520,3063820," Right."
3063820,3067620," So, but let's not talk about that because this is a shit for nerds."
3067620,3073340," And essentially, we're just moving both of the parameters towards in here."
3073340,3074120," Right."
3074800,3079600," So I'm not sure if it's useful in any way, but this is just like an additional parameter"
3079600,3083100," that our model can modify if it wants to."
3083100,3083460," Right."
3083460,3088500," So maybe it will find configuration of W and B that performs well."
3088500,3089360," I don't freaking know."
3089360,3094000," So let's actually, the beauty of this thing is that we can just like give it a bunch of parameters"
3094000,3095040," and let it go."
3095040,3096680," Just like do whatever you want."
3096680,3098820," Just find the configuration, whatever configuration."
3098820,3099240," Right."
3099560,3101280," So double the amount of parameters."
3101280,3101580," Yeah."
3101580,3107180," So we're already getting closer to GPT-4."
3107180,3107780," Right."
3107780,3112000," So before, right, we had this kind of stuff."
3112000,3112260," Right."
3112260,3115200," So this is GPT-4 and this is our model."
3115200,3117660," We added additional parameters."
3117660,3120420," So we're getting closer to GPT-4."
3121080,3125760," So OpenAI is literally shaking right now."
3125760,3127300," They're shivering."
3127300,3129300," Right."
3129300,3130640," So we're getting to them."
3130640,3131960," We're getting to them."
3131960,3135360," Anyway, we're doubling the amount of parameters."
3135360,3137780," Right."
3139840,3140300," Okay."
3140300,3146640," So, and yeah, so we have to call it, when we call the cost, we have to actually pass this"
3146640,3147820," entire thing everywhere."
3147820,3153940," So here we're competing the cost function, the original cost function two times, which is"
3153940,3154780," a little bit wasteful."
3154780,3157200," Speaking about like optimal solution, right?"
3157200,3158340," I'm using finite differences."
3158340,3164660," But anyway, I want to kind of save this entire thing to here."
3164660,3165260," Right."
3165260,3166340," So I'm going to put it in here."
3166340,3168260," Yep."
3168260,3168560," Yep."
3168900,3171920," So, and in here, we're constantly computing the cost function."
3171920,3172460," There we go."
3172460,3177140," So, yeah, I mean, why not?"
3177140,3183140," So we started with the weight, this and bias zero, which is kind of weird."
3183140,3185300," Isn't it supposed to be?"
3185300,3187040," Yeah, that's, that's absolutely weird."
3187040,3191120," I think bias, I think I just didn't print it."
3191120,3191340," Yeah."
3191340,3191620," Yeah."
3191620,3193940," I think I just didn't print it."
3193940,3195080," So that's the problem here."
3195080,3195440," Yeah."
3195440,3198720," So we started with the weight eight and bias one."
3198900,3205020," And it just like started to decrease until the bias became negative and becomes more and"
3205020,3205540," more negative."
3205540,3207560," And it's just like, yeah."
3207720,3213580," So you have two with a little bit of a fractional part and bias ends up just subtracting part"
3213580,3214580," of that fractional part."
3214580,3216660," So it doesn't really do anything useful."
3217820,3221040," But overall, right, it might help your neural networks."
3221040,3221880," So I heard."
3221880,3223700," I'm not an artificial intelligence person."
3223700,3225600," I don't fucking know how this entire shit works."
3225600,3226080," But anyway."
3226920,3227600," So cool."
3227600,3229980," That's pretty cool."
3229980,3236680," We have a neural network with a single neuron."
3236680,3243020," So let's maybe try to model something with a single neuron, but two inputs."
3243020,3245880," That would have been kind of interesting, I think."
3245880,3248700," But if we will do that, I think we need to make a small break."
3249380,3253140," Because I've been slapping the code for one hour."
3253140,3255320," And I think I need to make a cup of tea."
3255320,3256020," I ran out of tea."
3256020,3257540," So just a second."
3257540,3259640," I need to acknowledge one of the subs."
3259640,3266160," Thank you so much, Omega Sad Life, for four months of tier one subscription with a message."
3266160,3268280," Have you eaten traditional Neapolitan pizza?"
3268600,3280340," For the past several months, I've been watching on YouTube videos about traditional Neapolitan pizza."
3280340,3282560," And holy shit, I want to try that."
3282560,3289000," But unfortunately, I can't travel to Italy for that."
3289000,3292460," So the only way I can get that is I can try to make it myself."
3292940,3302000," But for a proper traditional Neapolitan pizza, I probably have to have like a, you know, like a stove or some sort of a dome."
3302000,3304940," Like it's kind of difficult because like how you cook that."
3304940,3308680," You have to cook it under intense heat very, very quickly."
3308680,3315960," But maybe we can have, maybe there is some pizza places in here in Siberia where I can try to find it."
3315960,3318380," But yeah, I never tried it, but I really want to."
3318380,3325540," I really want to because from what I heard, from what I saw, how it's prepared, how it's done, it must be freaking amazing."
3325540,3328220," And what I like about it, it's simplicity."
3328220,3329820," That's what I like."
3329820,3334260," This is actually something that I like about the entirety of Italian cuisine."
3334260,3338260," So because the Italian cuisine fascinates me extremely."
3338260,3343260," Because all of the dishes in Italian cuisine are dead simple."
3343260,3348280," They're all dead simple, but they're just like reduced to their like essence and perfection."
3348380,3354200," And that's, I think that's what makes the Italian cuisine so influential and so famous, right?"
3354200,3359580," It's just like simplicity, but at the same time, they just like remove everything that is not important"
3359580,3363000," and condense it to the actual essence of what makes it good."
3363000,3364040," Yeah."
3364040,3370580," So yeah, I like, I never tried it, but I want to, I really want to."
3370580,3371460," Maybe I will someday."
3371460,3374620," Anyway, what I want you to do, I want you to make a small break, right?"
3374720,3375480," So let's make a small break."
3375480,3381960," And so let's train a more complicated brain cell, right?"
3381960,3385820," So the one that accepts two inputs, the one that accepts two inputs."
3385820,3387960," I'm going to actually draw it myself this time."
3387960,3389860," Right."
3389860,3396880," So the one that we had before was essentially something like this."
3397060,3398180," So this is our brain cell."
3398180,3405060," So I'm going to put the sigma in here to indicate that it's a sum and the input was here."
3405060,3411780," So it had the weight, the input was X and the output was basically W, right?"
3411780,3413440," So that's a very simple brain cell."
3413440,3416860," Let's try to experiment with the brain cells, right?"
3416860,3419320," The brain cells that have two inputs, right?"
3419780,3422420," So it's going to be X1, right?"
3422420,3424420," And the second input is going to be X2."
3424420,3429160," And the weights, it's also need to have two weights, right?"
3429160,3430680," It was also going to have two weights."
3430680,3433580," And should it have any biases?"
3433580,3435120," We can introduce biases, right?"
3435120,3442080," But they kind of obscure what exactly their, like the brain cell is doing in our specific case, right?"
3442080,3444400," Because our goal right now is to like learn things."
3444740,3447480," So I think I'm not going to add any biases for this one as well."
3447480,3449720," So what such thing can model?"
3449720,3451700," I don't know."
3451700,3457960," Like maybe some different circuit elements like OR gates, right?"
3457960,3460360," OR gates and AND gates, right?"
3460360,3462180," Because they actually kind of fit perfectly."
3462180,3466440," Like OR gates and AND gates fit perfectly into this definition, right?"
3466440,3472440," It's a single element that just basically takes two inputs and produces one output."
3473300,3477340," And it's super easy to come up with the training set for such a brain cell."
3477340,3479820," So let's actually try to model these kind of things."
3479820,3484220," Another thing we can try to model is XOR gate."
3484220,3497880," But people who know anything about, you know, neural networks will know that you can't model XOR gate with a single brain cell."
3498560,3500940," Right, and this is something interesting about XOR gate."
3500940,3503500," So you actually need more brain cells to actually model XOR."
3503500,3505220," Right, but we'll get to that."
3505220,3506320," We'll get to that."
3506320,3515580," Let's try to, like a very simple neural network with a single brain cell, but two inputs."
3515580,3519820," Let's not ramp up the difficulty of our model too quickly."
3519820,3521160," Right, let's not do that."
3521900,3527640," Okay, so I kind of want to preserve this example as it is, because I think it's kind of cool by itself."
3527640,3534160," So I think I'm going to create a separate maybe file for the OR gates and AND gates and stuff like that."
3534160,3535140," So I'm going to remove main."
3535140,3539260," And I'm going to replace this thing to maybe twice."
3539260,3540720," Right, so this is going to be twice."
3540880,3544820," So this is a very simple brain cell that doubles its input."
3544820,3546900," Right, it just doubles its input."
3546900,3548240," And that's basically what it does."
3548240,3551900," Right, so here I'm going to just say, okay, twice."
3551900,3554700," There we go."
3555220,3557180," And let's create another example."
3557180,3560100," Right, and we're going to have gates."
3560100,3560880," Right."
3560880,3565600," Gates.c."
3565600,3569660," And I'm going to do include stdh."
3569660,3572540," Maybe I'm going to actually copy some stuff from here."
3572540,3574300," Right."
3574300,3580640," So what kind of training set are we going to have, for example, for the OR gates?"
3580640,3582960," Right, so OR gate."
3584840,3590040," So I suppose what we can do, we can have an array of triples."
3590040,3596260," The first two elements of the triple are going to be the inputs of this entire thing."
3596260,3597780," Right, so for instance, 0, 0."
3597780,3600380," And the third one is going to be the output."
3600380,3606180," Right, so if you have 1 and 0, the result must be 1."
3606180,3610100," Then if you have 0, 1, the result must be 1."
3610100,3612160," And if you have 1, 1, the result must be 1."
3612160,3613320," So this is OR gate."
3614460,3622100," So the cost function is going to be basically the same."
3622100,3625260," Almost, right, it's going to be basically the same."
3625260,3627540," But we have two inputs now."
3627540,3628760," Right, so we have two inputs."
3628760,3631560," So we have input like x1 and x2."
3631560,3637040," Right, and they're coming from train i0 and train i01."
3637040,3638540," Train i1."
3639140,3644020," So, and the model itself has two weights, right?"
3644020,3647760," So it has two weights, w1 and w2."
3647760,3653840," Right, and how we're applying them, we just take x1, w1 plus x2, w2."
3653840,3655040," And here is the result."
3655520,3664040," And we are finding the difference between that actual result and the expected and just add all of that up to the cost function."
3664040,3665820," And there you go, we've got a cost function."
3665820,3672360," Right, so let's actually create an entry point and create initial model, right?"
3672440,3676680," So it's going to be two weights in here, weight 1 and weight 2, and they're random."
3677300,3680020," So that requires the random float."
3680020,3682900," So let me copy paste this thing in here."
3682900,3685000," There we go."
3685000,3686480," So we've got a random thing here."
3686480,3688320," That's pretty cool."
3688320,3694360," So let's fixate this thing to one specific seed."
3694360,3698100," And let's take a look at our beautiful, beautiful model."
3698100,3699420," Let's take a look at it."
3701960,3706640," Let's gaze upon it in all its beauty."
3706640,3710280," I'm going to just do that and gaze."
3710280,3711580," Cool."
3711580,3713400," So this is the model."
3713400,3715300," This is its initial weight."
3715300,3718220," How well does it even perform?"
3718220,3720680," Right, how well does it even perform?"
3720680,3721680," Let's find out."
3721680,3723140," Right, so we're going to compute the cost."
3723140,3727120," Cost, w1, w2."
3727120,3728500," And let's take a look at it."
3728500,3731320," C equal this, like so."
3731720,3732400," That's the cost."
3732400,3733940," Does it perform well?"
3733940,3735700," Not really."
3735700,3738280," Not really, though."
3738280,3740860," Though it's close."
3740860,3743700," It can actually get pretty close, right?"
3743700,3748740," So can we drive that entire cost down?"
3748740,3752560," So essentially we need to compute things like dw1, right?"
3752560,3759840," So this is going to be basically plus epsilon minus this original cost divided by epsilon."
3760480,3763400," And we can repeat that for the second thing in here."
3763400,3764460," So this one is just one."
3764460,3768160," We're just like trying to wiggle both of the parameters, right?"
3768160,3769460," Just wiggle in both of the parameters."
3770080,3772700," And then we are updating this entire stuff."
3772700,3777980," So minus rate multiply by dw1 and then to replace one, two."
3777980,3779320," There we go."
3779320,3783420," So and that should improve the cost."
3783420,3787180," So here we can just print this entire cost."
3787560,3788680," So this is going to be..."
3788680,3790440," Let's put it this way."
3790440,3794760," I'm going to print that and then cf."
3794760,3796680," I'm going to put c in here."
3796680,3798900," And we're going to repeat that a couple of times, right?"
3798900,3802800," So very simple training process a couple of times."
3803460,3806460," And that should work out at the end of the day."
3806460,3808400," All right."
3808400,3810680," So this is going to work."
3810680,3815540," It doesn't really compile because we didn't define epsilon and rate."
3815760,3821860," So let's actually take epsilon and rate from this twice example, right?"
3821860,3822780," So this is the R."
3822780,3823120," Okay."
3823120,3825320," You can copy paste them directly."
3825320,3826120," Epsilon and rate."
3826120,3827680," So we're going to have..."
3827680,3828300," Okay."
3828300,3829740," So did the cost decrease?"
3829740,3830020," Okay."
3830020,3830980," The cost decreased."
3830980,3832260," The cost decreased."
3832260,3834500," So that means it kind of works."
3834500,3835740," All right."
3835740,3837100," Let's repeat that 100 times."
3837100,3838540," Is it going to..."
3838540,3840920," Yeah, it keeps decreasing, but not really that fast."
3840920,3843160," Not as fast as I would like to."
3843160,3844380," So maybe 500."
3845400,3847280," It's decreasing, all right."
3847280,3849060," So it is, in fact, decreasing."
3849060,3850100," That's kind of cool."
3850100,3851820," So what about 1,000?"
3851820,3854120," What about 1,000 of times?"
3854120,3855760," All right."
3855760,3859420," So I'm starting to hit actually a very interesting problem."
3859420,3861940," Is that the..."
3861940,3865320," Like Emacs is not a very good terminal, right?"
3865320,3866980," That's kind of a problem, right?"
3866980,3875040," So and the entire training process may be stalled just by the latency of the terminal."
3875040,3879980," So it would be better to actually run this entire thing in your XVT, right?"
3879980,3881180," So it's going to be a little bit faster."
3881180,3882200," So let me switch to here."
3882200,3883340," Right."
3883340,3887340," And I'm going to just be rebuilding everything and just running this thing in here."
3887340,3888640," So as you can see, it's a little bit faster."
3888640,3889560," Right."
3889560,3891740," It's a little bit faster in the terminal."
3892840,3896080," So what if I put 2,000, right?"
3896080,3897140," What if it's 2,000?"
3897140,3898580," Yeah."
3898580,3903000," It's going slower, but maybe we can increase the rate."
3903000,3905480," What if we increase the rate a little bit?"
3905480,3910720," So this is yet another phase of just like stirring this shit around until it kind of works."
3915840,3919300," and here until it kind of works and yeah."
3919300,3920980," So I think, yeah."
3920980,3922700," And here is an interesting thing."
3922700,3927160," This thing starts to sort of like oscillate, right?"
3927160,3928720," This thing starts to oscillate."
3928720,3930600," Right."
3930600,3932560," And this is a very interesting situation."
3932560,3937880," So essentially it's just like too big of a step, right?"
3937940,3942240," It is too big of a step and it's kind of dangerous for that."
3942240,3943700," So you can't really do that."
3943700,3948200," So what if we reduce the step, but like twice of that?"
3948200,3949400," Yeah."
3949400,3953280," It's not really slowing down any further."
3953280,3959140," One of the things that neural networks do, right?"
3959140,3961300," Yeah, chat already."
3961300,3964720," Chat already spamming about that."
3964720,3967640," One of the things that neural networks do,"
3967940,3971780," they actually have at the end of them, right?"
3971780,3975860," At the end of the neurons, something called activation function, right?"
3975860,3981680," So on top of like just summing up all of the inputs and the weights,"
3981680,3985260," they also apply an activation function, F."
3985260,3986240," Right."
3986240,3988040," And what's the purpose of activation function?"
3988040,3993680," So like after you summed up all of the inputs and all of the weights and biases,"
3994000,3999920," you may end up with completely unbound value that goes like around and stuff like that."
3999920,4002200," And what the activation function are trying to do,"
4002200,4006140," they're trying to sort of like squish and sort of like, you know,"
4006140,4009100," isolate that value."
4009100,4016040," Quite often people use a function called sigmoid as an activation function."
4016120,4017580," And it's actually a very convenient function."
4017580,4020560," It's actually a very convenient function."
4020560,4021940," It's not..."
4021940,4023360," What the fuck?"
4023360,4026200," Freaking dag, dag, go."
4026200,4033120," Anyway, so they're trying to sort of like tell us that it's shit probably."
4033120,4036720," Anyway, so it's a really cool function"
4036720,4045000," because it maps value from minus infinity to plus infinity to zero to one."
4045000,4047020," Right."
4047020,4048240," So that's what it does."
4048240,4049180," Look at that."
4049180,4052300," So its value is from zero to one."
4052300,4055760," But the more you go to minus infinity,"
4055760,4057380," to minus infinity,"
4057380,4059280," the closer it becomes to zero."
4059280,4061380," The more you go to plus infinity,"
4061380,4063400," the more it goes towards one."
4063400,4065560," And it's just like takes any value"
4065560,4067080," and it just squishes it"
4067080,4069760," and maps it exactly to from zero to one."
4069760,4071280," And it's actually very useful."
4071280,4075880," And it kind of fits perfectly to our, you know, purpose."
4075880,4079480," Because here we're trying to model an end gate."
4079480,4082380," And the inputs and outputs of the end gate"
4082380,4083640," is probably going to be zero and one."
4083640,4090540," So maybe we can just slap the sigmoid on top of our model"
4090540,4092880," and see whether it improves anything"
4092880,4094040," or it doesn't improve anything."
4094040,4094800," I don't know."
4094800,4097820," So these days people, yeah,"
4097820,4101340," quite often use a relu function, relu."
4101340,4102720," Right."
4102720,4104760," And it's actually way simpler than sigmoid."
4104760,4109120," So it's just like allows the value to grow indefinitely,"
4109120,4111180," but it doesn't allow to grow like down."
4111180,4113800," So it basically cuts off all the negative values."
4113800,4115980," And the reason why people use that"
4115980,4119880," is kind of like outside of the topic of today's stream."
4119880,4120260," Right."
4120260,4123580," So if from what I heard on the internet, right,"
4123580,4124940," from what I heard on the internet,"
4124940,4129180," it's really important when you're doing deep learning"
4129180,4131700," along with using backpropagation."
4131700,4132880," Right."
4132880,4136540," So if you're stacking a lot of layers of the neural network,"
4136540,4137300," right,"
4137300,4138740," and you're using backpropagation"
4138740,4141060," to speed up the computing of the gradient,"
4141060,4143400," it's very important to use relu,"
4143400,4144140," right,"
4144140,4146780," to sort of avoid the vanishing of the gradient."
4146780,4148980," This is how I understood it."
4148980,4149240," Right."
4149240,4150900," So,"
4150900,4153280," but this is kind of outside of the scope of today's stream."
4153280,4153500," Right."
4153500,4155680," So it's like a lot of technicalities."
4155680,4157160," Right."
4157320,4161220," which I don't really want to go into right now"
4161220,4163640," because we're not some freaking nerds."
4163640,4166800," We're AI ML chat bros."
4166800,4167820," That's who we are."
4167820,4170220," And all of these derivatives and like functions"
4170220,4171520," is just for nerds,"
4171520,4172320," not for us."
4172320,4174140," That's why I'm not going to go into that today."
4174140,4175120," So,"
4175120,4175320," yeah."
4175320,4180860," So we've got some subs."
4180860,4181940," We've got some subs."
4181940,4183220," Thank you so much."

4205080,4205740," yeah."
4205740,4206060," So,"
4206060,4206740," there are different"
4206740,4208160," activation functions"
4208160,4208960," that you can use"

4209400,4210540," to pick one"

4216640,4217380," they solve."
4217380,4218560," Right."
4218560,4219040," So,"
4219040,4219700," on the surface,"
4219700,4220840," this entire area"
4220840,4221800," like machine learning,"
4221800,4222620," artificial intelligence"
4222620,4223860," is rather simple."
4223860,4224280," Right."
4224280,4224460," So,"
4224460,4225060," you have a model,"
4225060,4226240," you have a cost function,"
4226240,4228180," you can like tweak around"
4228180,4228760," the parameters"
4228760,4229640," and your goal"
4229640,4230380," is just to minimize"
4230380,4231840," the cost function"
4231840,4232600," and that's it."
4232600,4233280," That's it."
4233280,4233640," Right."
4233640,4234320," But,"
4234320,4235500," on how you can do that"
4235500,4236300," and how to do that"
4236300,4236920," efficiently,"
4236920,4237740," that's where,"
4237740,4239120," you know,"
4239120,4240280," a lot of different"
4240280,4241280," interesting details"
4241280,4242360," start to pop up"
4242360,4242880," and the whole"
4242880,4243620," sort of area"
4243620,4244220," of research"
4244220,4244780," emerges."
4244780,4246280," Right."
4246280,4251160," Okay,"
4251160,4252040," so,"
4252040,4253300," okay,"
4253300,4254460," let's actually slap"
4254460,4255860," the sigmoid function"
4255860,4257040," on top of the entire model."
4257040,4257240," So,"
4257240,4257640," let's actually,"
4257640,4259240," a code is the sigmoid function."
4259240,4260060," So,"
4260060,4260580," I'm going to call it"
4260580,4260840," sig,"
4260840,4262300," f,"
4262300,4262920," right,"
4262920,4263360," so,"
4263360,4264220," so,"
4264220,4265360," f usually in c"
4265360,4266620," indicates that,"
4267220,4268280," you know,"
4268280,4269940," that we're working"
4269940,4270500," with floats,"
4270500,4270980," right,"
4270980,4272420," maybe to,"
4272420,4273740," to actually put it"
4273740,4274360," like a full one,"
4274360,4274580," yeah,"
4274580,4276560," sigmoid f,"
4276560,4278380," because usually in c"
4278380,4279280," you have functions"
4279280,4280020," like cosine,"
4280020,4281220," sine,"
4281220,4283440," a square t,"
4283440,4284820," and by default"
4284820,4287020," in standard c library,"
4287020,4287840," they all work"
4287840,4288400," with doubles,"
4288400,4288820," right,"
4288820,4289960," so they all accept"
4289960,4290440," doubles,"
4290440,4291600," and if you want"
4291600,4292720," to work with floats,"
4292720,4293280," right,"
4293280,4294280," you have to use"
4294280,4294880," these variants"
4294880,4295560," of the functions"
4295560,4299160," that have a suffix f,"
4299160,4300680," so this is sort of like"
4300680,4301360," a more or less"
4301360,4303500," standard naming in c,"
4303500,4304460," and I kind of like"
4304460,4305080," to follow it"
4305080,4305900," when I define,"
4305900,4308720," define mathematical functions"
4308720,4309180," like that,"
4309180,4309460," right,"
4309460,4309760," so,"
4309760,4310940," I think it does make sense."
4310940,4311820," Okay,"
4311820,4312300," so,"
4312300,4313220," what we can do,"
4313220,4313960," we can just like"
4313960,4315860," code this specific formula,"
4315860,4316220," right,"
4316220,4316520," so,"
4316520,4318140," exponent minus x,"
4318140,4318480," right,"
4318480,4318820," so,"
4318820,4320100," basically,"
4320100,4321020," one,"
4321600,4323460," divided by one"
4323460,4326320," plus exponent"
4326320,4327440," minus x,"
4327440,4327980," so,"
4327980,4330320," plus exp f"
4330320,4331900," minus x,"
4331900,4332580," there we go,"
4332580,4332960," so,"
4332960,4333880," that's the formula,"
4333880,4336280," that's the entire formula,"
4336280,4338020," and let me take a look,"
4338020,4339040," exp f,"
4339040,4340180," eh,"
4340180,4341800," this is not how we do that,"
4341800,4343780," I'm supposed to use"
4343780,4344380," man,"
4344380,4347740," exp f,"
4347740,4349020," yo,"
4349020,4349740," there we go,"
4349740,4350040," so,"
4350040,4350620," as you can see,"
4351080,4351980," exp by itself"
4351980,4352820," works with doubles,"
4352820,4353940," and exp f"
4353940,4354860," works with floats,"
4354860,4356160," there's also l version"
4356160,4358360," which works with long doubles,"
4358360,4359600," look at that,"
4359600,4360560," long doubles,"
4360560,4363460," you have to also link with lm,"
4363460,4366520," which actually forces us"
4366520,4367980," to change our compilation script,"
4367980,4368260," right,"
4368260,4368460," so,"
4368460,4369360," this is the first time"
4369360,4370780," we're using mathematical library,"
4370780,4372720," we're using mathematical library"
4372720,4374940," literally for one single function"
4374940,4376440," that I don't want to code myself"
4376440,4376860," right now,"
4376860,4377900," right,"
4377900,4378760," but that's what we're doing,"
4379080,4379380," so,"
4379380,4380040," and essentially how"
4380040,4380940," we're going to splat and all that,"
4380940,4383020," since we're just using finite difference,"
4383020,4383420," right,"
4383420,4385920," we're not using like actual gradient descent"
4385920,4386900," or anything like that"
4386900,4388360," where we have to compute the derivative"
4388360,4389460," of this entire function,"
4389460,4391000," which is not actually that hard,"
4391000,4393260," especially if you're using just like one layer,"
4393260,4395160," it's pretty straightforward,"
4395160,4396140," like with one layer,"
4396140,4397720," you don't even have to use back propagation,"
4397880,4400320," I'm really sorry for all that stupid nerdy shit,"
4400320,4401500," I'm going to stop,"
4401500,4401920," but yeah,"
4401920,4404960," so sigmoid f,"
4404960,4407540," and we just slap it in here,"
4407540,4409960," and that is going to limit the values"
4409960,4412500," of like everything to zero and one,"
4412500,4413680," okay,"
4413680,4414840," so let's actually take a look"
4414840,4418020," at how exactly sigmoid works,"
4418020,4418980," it's actually rather interesting,"
4418980,4421520," so I'm going to end the program in here,"
4421520,4423660," and I'm going to just iterate through some values,"
4423780,4427780," let's actually iterate through minus 10,"
4427780,4429320," minus 10 f,"
4429320,4432280," up until plus 10 f,"
4432280,4435360," and we're going to add one,"
4435360,4436160," right,"
4436160,4437120," something like that,"
4437120,4438140," and what I want to see"
4438140,4441800," is basically this thing,"
4441800,4443200," right,"
4443200,4446120," so here's the x,"
4446120,4448400," and here is the sigmoid x,"
4448400,4449400," right,"
4449400,4451780," and we'll also put new lines in here,"
4451780,4453460," build,"
4453780,4454600," gates,"
4454600,4455760," there we go,"
4455760,4458280," so it complained about this thing,"
4458280,4461260," this is because it doesn't have any declarations of this function,"
4461260,4462180," let's include math,"
4462180,4463460," and there we go,"
4463460,4469540," so we have the range from minus 10 to plus 10,"
4469540,4470880," right,"
4470880,4474820," but it's still from zero to one,"
4474820,4479860," and it doesn't matter how big of a range it is,"
4479860,4481440," it like literally doesn't matter,"
4481780,4486000," you can iterate from minus 100 to plus 100,"
4486000,4488140," and let's actually in this case make a step 10,"
4488140,4490080," so it doesn't consume everything on the screen,"
4490080,4492700," and it's still going to be from zero to one,"
4492700,4494440," it literally doesn't care,"
4494440,4494760," right,"
4494820,4496720," so it basically stops at one around,"
4496720,4502120," but it's just like flow doesn't have enough precision to show that it's less than one,"
4502120,4502580," as far as I know,"
4502580,4504680," it never actually reaches the one,"
4504680,4507000," it just basically approaches one indefinitely,"
4507000,4507660," right,"
4507660,4508540," that's how it works,"
4508540,4509060," I think,"
4509540,4510400," I'm not a mathematician,"
4510400,4512620," so I'm an ooga-booga software developer,"
4512620,4514140," so,"
4514140,4514640," yeah,"
4514640,4517520," so in here it infinitely approaches zero,"
4517520,4518940," which is kind of cool,"
4518940,4519140," right,"
4519140,4520640," so just like between zero and one,"
4521400,4524580," so let me see,"
4524580,4526840," so that changes the model completely,"
4526840,4527260," right,"
4527260,4528520," so that changes the model completely,"
4528520,4530820," and let's see how it behaves now,"
4530820,4531300," right,"
4531300,4532160," how it behaves now,"
4533620,4538960," and it kind of,"
4538960,4539240," yeah,"
4539240,4540160," it kind of reduces,"
4540160,4541460," but not too much,"
4541460,4542580," but maybe now,"
4542580,4544280," since we're sort of limiting everything,"
4544280,4548760," maybe it will make it easy to increase the rate,"
4548760,4549560," yeah,"
4549560,4551120," so we can now increase the rate,"
4551120,4553960," so let me increase the size,"
4553960,4555040," what about thousands,"
4555040,4556360," right,"
4556360,4557680," so what about thousands,"
4557680,4559060," oh,"
4559060,4559460," it's,"
4559460,4559900," yeah,"
4559900,4560340," okay,"
4560340,4561040," so it's actually,"
4561040,4562060," yeah,"
4562060,4563380," okay,"
4563620,4566480," so what about two thousands,"
4566480,4572000," I should stop running this entire thing in Emacs,"
4572000,4573160," and just let it do it in here,"
4573160,4573580," okay,"
4573580,4576660," so what if I also decrease the epsilon,"
4576660,4577900," right,"
4577900,4581820," I think it's a little bit faster,"
4581820,4583380," but what we want to do is probably,"
4583380,4585600," like maybe five thousands in here,"
4585600,4587340," right,"
4587340,4589040," maybe even more,"
4589040,4592560," so I suppose now I can actually,"
4592820,4593780," increase,"
4593780,4593920," increase,"
4593920,4596200," it keeps decreasing,"
4596200,4598520," so what about ten thousands,"
4598520,4604280," 50 thousands,"
4604280,4610060," okay,"
4610060,4612400," but what's fine is that it slows down,"
4612400,4614000," but it keeps decreasing anyway,"
4614660,4617280," so can I push it further,"
4617280,4618700," I suppose,"
4618700,4620380," what if I make the epsilon,"
4620380,4621620," like smaller,"
4621620,4625520," yeah,"
4625520,4628540," so what if I don't print anything,"
4628540,4630040," what if I don't print anything,"
4630040,4630920," and I'm gonna say,"
4630920,4631240," okay,"
4631240,4633900," make a million of iterations,"
4633900,4634760," right,"
4634840,4637180," and then print the final result in here,"
4637180,4638140," all right,"
4638140,4639840," so hopefully,"
4639840,4642220," so in the cost in here,"
4642220,4644320," has to be cost w1,"
4644320,4646220," w2,"
4646220,4646840," right,"
4646840,4647880," so let's actually do that,"
4647880,4649480," and let's wait a little bit,"
4649480,4652640," cost is still kind of shy,"
4652880,4655720," what about the epsilon,"
4656760,4659600," mm-hmm,"
4659600,4661800," mm-hmm,"
4661800,4664100," mm-hmm,"
4664100,4668940," mm-hmm,"
4668940,4670660," you use German words,"
4670660,4671180," yeah,"
4671180,4674720," mm-hmm,"
4674720,4676220," all right,"
4676220,4678660," so let me,"
4678660,4679860," let me see,"
4679860,4681000," let me see,"
4681000,4687340," so I don't think increasing this entire stuff is going to work in any way,"
4687340,4688920," so it's still rather,"
4688920,4690660," does it even,"
4690660,4694500," does it even increase or decrease or anything like that,"
4694500,4700660," so let's print this entire stuff,"
4700660,4704800," mm-hmm,"
4706220,4711620," it's decreasing,"
4711620,4714780," but it takes too much time to actually go anywhere,"
4714780,4716360," unfortunately,"
4716360,4720600," it takes a lot of time to go anywhere,"
4720600,4723720," and it slows down over time,"
4723720,4726460," mm-mm-mm,"
4726460,4730540," it slows down over time,"
4730540,4731960," so maybe we should,"
4731960,4732460," oh, yeah,"
4732460,4734680," here's another interesting thing,"
4735280,4737160," so maybe we're simply starting,"
4737160,4741060," not from a good initial state,"
4741060,4743700," maybe that's the problem,"
4743700,4744800," hmm,"
4744800,4745880," maybe that's the problem,"
4745880,4746600," what if we just,"
4746600,4749160," do this thing randomly,"
4749160,4750180," like,"
4750180,4752020," we start randomly every time,"
4752020,4752800," right,"
4752800,4755940," so welcome to machine learning,"
4755940,4756700," by the way,"
4756700,4759980," okay,"
4759980,4760580," so,"
4760580,4768220," stir it up,"
4768220,4768640," yes,"
4768640,4769380," stir it up,"
4769380,4769840," is it,"
4769840,4771300," is it improving over time,"
4771300,4772980," is it actually improving,"
4773980,4774780," though,"
4774780,4779220," let me double check that I didn't make any mistakes in here,"
4779760,4781260," so this is one,"
4781260,4783020," so this is supposed to be zero,"
4783020,4785100," so this is three,"
4785100,4786340," okay,"
4786340,4787560," so I need to,"
4787560,4789140," I really need to double check that I,"
4789140,4791500," I'm not making any mistakes,"
4791500,4792820," for sure,"
4792820,4793420," for sure,"
4793420,4795400," so this is a training,"
4795400,4797640," this is difference between these things,"
4797640,4803320," so what if I,"
4803320,4806780," I don't think swapping this stuff matters,"
4806780,4808140," per se,"
4808140,4809680," right,"
4809680,4810460," because it's going to be,"
4810460,4811220," if it's going to be negative,"
4811220,4812420," it's going to be fine anyway,"
4812420,4813900," so then we just do training,"
4813900,4815740," so this is fine,"
4815740,4816660," random float,"
4816660,4817200," we can actually,"
4817200,4817800," like,"
4817800,4818700," multiply maybe,"
4818700,4820800," by 10,"
4820800,4822000," and subtract 5,"
4822000,4824180," and give it a little bit bigger range,"
4824180,4824640," right,"
4824640,4826000," give it a little bit bigger range,"
4826740,4828540," and somewhere around here,"
4828540,4829420," what we're doing,"
4829420,4831420," we're just,"
4831420,4832560," yeah,"
4832560,4834720," subtracting that,"
4834720,4835540," subtracting that,"
4835540,4836540," so this is the cost,"
4836540,4838020," everything seems to be fine,"
4838020,4840460," and this should work,"
4840460,4841600," more or less,"
4841600,4843920," so let's give it a more,"
4843920,4845020," more try,"
4845020,4850460," so it feels like,"
4850460,4854200," it starts from the same thing,"
4854200,4854980," let me,"
4855280,4857320," let me do,"
4857320,4858720," one iteration,"
4858720,4860900," just to see where it starts from,"
4860900,4863680," does it start from different places,"
4863680,4864040," yeah,"
4864040,4865620," it does start from different places,"
4865620,4866460," which is good,"
4866460,4868420," all right,"
4868420,4870740," so which is actually good,"
4872080,4876400," so let's do the sound of these things,"
4876400,4884600," one of the things we probably also want to do,"
4884600,4886740," maybe we don't really need,"
4886740,4891320," all of that stuff,"
4891320,4892220," all of that stuff,"
4892220,4895540," sigmoid is used in cost,"
4895540,4898840," try using a different cost function,"
4898840,4899620," I don't think,"
4899620,4901260," yeah,"
4901260,4902520," this cost function should be fine,"
4902520,4903100," in my opinion,"
4903100,4904460," right,"
4904460,4905320," it should be,"
4905320,4908540," it should be fine,"
4908640,4910140," one of the things I want to do,"
4910140,4910540," by the way,"
4910540,4912360," after we ended the training,"
4912360,4912720," right,"
4912720,4913800," after we ended the training,"
4913800,4915560," I want to actually iterate,"
4915560,4918240," through the data,"
4918240,4918580," right,"
4918580,4919640," through the training data,"
4919640,4921700," or maybe we can just,"
4921700,4923020," do the following iteration,"
4923020,4923940," less than two,"
4923940,4925660," plus plus i,"
4926280,4928240," and just do j,"
4928240,4930920," and see how well that thing performs,"
4930920,4932800," right,"
4932800,4934500," so this is going to be z u,"
4934500,4936460," so this is or,"
4936460,4936880," right,"
4936880,4939340," so that means we can do or,"
4939340,4942040," and then equal to app,"
4942040,4942700," right,"
4942700,4946420," and let's just forward this entire thing,"
4946420,4948460," let's just forward this entire thing,"
4948460,4949880," like so,"
4949880,4951360," so,"
4951360,4952420," but in this case,"
4952420,4953780," this is i,"
4953780,4954840," and this is j,"
4954840,4955380," right,"
4955480,4956140," so this is i,"
4956140,4956740," and this is j,"
4956740,4958540," and see if it like performs well,"
4958540,4960680," like how exactly does it perform,"
4960680,4961820," maybe it performs fine,"
4961820,4963740," so i,"
4963740,4964220," j,"
4964220,4965900," uh-huh,"
4965900,4966360," uh-huh,"
4966360,4969740," and that's already kind of okay,"
4969740,4970560," believe it or not,"
4970560,4972120," right,"
4972120,4976860," so even though the cost function doesn't become 100% zero,"
4976860,4978680," look at that,"
4978680,4980880," I mean on zero zero,"
4980880,4982900," it's like equal to have,"
4982900,4985320," but where it's supposed to be one,"
4985320,4987100," it is actually closer to one,"
4987100,4989360," right,"
4989360,4992460," it would be better to train it a little bit more,"
4992460,4993120," right,"
4993120,4995240," it would be better to train it a little bit more,"
4995240,4997540," like maybe 10,000 times,"
4997540,4998700," if you know what i mean,"
4998700,4999880," uh,"
4999880,5000200," right,"
5000200,5002340," to drive down this specific thing,"
5002340,5003280," uh,"
5003280,5003640," right,"
5003640,5004240," even better,"
5004340,5005060," but for some reason,"
5005060,5009320," that specific case doesn't really go well,"
5009320,5011440," it doesn't really go well,"
5011440,5012500," I don't really know why,"
5012500,5013720," uh,"
5013720,5014820," right,"
5014820,5015880," so we can try to do it,"
5015880,5016120," yeah,"
5016120,5018160," for some reason,"
5018160,5020100," it's stack for this zero five,"
5020480,5026900," so if we try,"
5026900,5027620," uh,"
5027620,5028540," for instance,"
5028540,5030040," 100 of these things,"
5030040,5031220," is it going to,"
5031220,5032160," yeah,"
5032160,5034600," uh,"
5034600,5035400," yeah,"
5035400,5036360," there we go,"
5042360,5044120," because sigmoid zero is,"
5044120,5044900," ah,"
5044900,5045240," yeah,"
5045240,5052560," sigmoid zero is half,"
5052560,5054200," it is always half,"
5054200,5058380," you know what,"
5058900,5060840," that actually means"
5060840,5063220," that we have to sigmoid"
5063220,5064680," axes as well,"
5064680,5068820," that is very interesting point,"
5068820,5069500," oh,"
5069500,5070280," you know,"
5070280,5070800," yeah,"
5070800,5072640," that basically means"
5072640,5074260," that we can only initialize"
5074260,5074800," this stuff"
5074800,5076120," from zero to one,"
5076120,5076980," yeah,"
5076980,5079140," uh,"
5079140,5079440," yeah,"
5079440,5079720," yeah,"
5079720,5079840," yeah,"
5079840,5081080," so essentially,"
5081080,5082280," that's the only thing"
5082280,5083060," we can do now,"
5083060,5085360," uh,"
5085360,5088360," no,"
5088440,5096580," and I suppose"
5096580,5097980," we can try to,"
5097980,5100260," well,"
5100260,5100500," I mean,"
5100500,5100960," this,"
5100960,5102860," huh,"
5102860,5106160," maybe you can add a bias,"
5106160,5107720," let's try to add a bias,"
5107720,5108580," that's a good idea,"
5108580,5109960," that's a good idea,"
5109960,5111320," let's add a bias,"
5111320,5114280," all right,"
5114280,5115440," maybe that's why"
5115440,5116060," you need a bias,"
5116060,5116640," by the way,"
5116640,5118220," maybe we're about to,"
5118220,5121700," find out something"
5121700,5122360," very important"
5122360,5123500," about neural networks"
5123500,5124640," and why exactly"
5124640,5125820," you need to have a bias,"
5125820,5127480," right,"
5127480,5128100," so,"
5128100,5131120," so you can upset"
5131120,5131960," things around,"
5131960,5132680," yeah,"
5132680,5133000," so,"
5133000,5133800," um,"
5133800,5135260," and bias could be"
5135260,5136220," a minus half,"
5136220,5136500," yeah,"
5136500,5137420," that's actually a good point,"
5137420,5138500," that's actually a good point,"
5138500,5139640," uh,"
5139640,5140500," but it's,"
5140500,5141500," we're gonna let the model"
5141500,5142580," to discover all of that,"
5142580,5142900," right,"
5143460,5144560," so we're gonna let the model"
5144560,5145160," to do that,"
5145160,5149660," so this is gonna be"
5149660,5150520," the bias,"
5150520,5152420," uh,"
5152420,5153160," db,"
5154740,5156620," b,"
5156620,5157360," f,"
5157360,5159760," b,"
5159760,5161020," there we go,"
5161020,5163020," almost,"
5163020,5163680," yeah,"
5163680,5164520," we have to pass"
5164520,5165580," this thing in here,"
5165580,5166840," and,"
5166840,5167920," yo,"
5167920,5168780," look at that,"
5168780,5169820," what the fuck,"
5169820,5171360," it's almost zero,"
5171820,5174340," and this is the lesson,"
5174340,5175020," boys and girls,"
5175020,5175940," why you,"
5175940,5176800," this is the answer"
5176800,5178840," why you need to have a bias,"
5178840,5179580," uh,"
5179580,5180520," even though it kinda,"
5180520,5181100," yeah,"
5181100,5183120," so,"
5183120,5184160," it performed better,"
5184160,5185860," but it still have a happen here,"
5185860,5186960," uh,"
5186960,5187380," all right,"
5187380,5187720," so,"
5187720,5189460," we can try to do even more,"
5189460,5192660," all right,"
5192660,5193180," so,"
5193180,5193720," bias,"
5193720,5195500," kinda works out,"
5195500,5197340," oh,"
5197340,5198140," I didn't add,"
5198140,5198440," okay,"
5198440,5199060," I'm sorry,"
5199060,5200460," I forgot to add a bias"
5200460,5201480," in the forwarding,"
5201720,5202000," so,"
5202000,5203500," maybe it makes sense to,"
5203500,5203740," um,"
5203740,5205680," have a separate function,"
5205680,5206700," which is called forward,"
5206700,5207920," right,"
5207920,5210240," where you specify the,"
5210240,5210840," the model,"
5210840,5211320," right,"
5211320,5212240," and,"
5212240,5213380," I mean,"
5213380,5215560," it's kinda,"
5215560,5216980," it's kinda stupid function,"
5216980,5217340," would be,"
5217340,5217580," right,"
5217580,5217760," so,"
5217760,5218880," we don't really have that"
5218880,5220460," complicated of a thing,"
5220460,5221440," uh,"
5221440,5221680," right,"
5221680,5222880," that complicated of a thing"
5222880,5224280," to actually introduce such functions,"
5224280,5224500," so,"
5224500,5224920," let's actually,"
5224920,5225840," let it be,"
5225840,5227840," look how fast that it actually"
5227840,5229160," approaches zero,"
5229160,5229380," like,"
5229380,5230320," look at that column,"
5230320,5230660," right,"
5230660,5230840," so,"
5230840,5231240," this is the,"
5231240,5231620," I'm not sure,"
5231620,5233320," if the encoding allows you"
5233320,5233820," to see that,"
5233820,5234740," but this is so cool,"
5234740,5236020," uh,"
5236020,5236480," right,"
5236480,5237540," and look at that,"
5237540,5238320," this is or,"
5238320,5239900," this is literally or,"
5239900,5241160," you can even use like,"
5241160,5242880," half as an indicator,"
5242880,5243280," so,"
5243280,5245320," if the value of the neuron"
5245320,5246340," is less than half,"
5246340,5247080," that means it's zero,"
5247080,5248020," if it's more than half,"
5248020,5248760," that means it's one,"
5248760,5250220," and it found the configuration"
5250220,5251660," that acts like or,"
5251660,5253380," right,"
5254440,5256000," it acts like or,"
5256000,5256000," it acts like or,"
5256000,5257920," do a graph,"
5257920,5258940," and let's,"
5258940,5259660," let's give it a try,"
5259660,5259960," sure,"
5259960,5262140," one of the things we can do,"
5262140,5263800," right,"
5263800,5264560," so,"
5264560,5265520," let's,"
5265520,5268440," let's see,"
5268440,5269240," so,"
5269240,5273860," I can spend a lot of time"
5273860,5276800," coding something that would"
5276800,5278020," show the graph,"
5278360,5279880," but one of the things we can do,"
5279880,5281420," one of the things we can do,"
5281420,5283540," is we can just dump the cost function,"
5283540,5283780," right,"
5283780,5284640," and,"
5284640,5285020," uh,"
5285020,5287420," we can just save it to cost txt,"
5287420,5288000," right,"
5288000,5289560," and then using gnu plot,"
5289560,5290460," uh,"
5290460,5291900," we can plot,"
5291900,5293120," uh,"
5293120,5294780," cost txt"
5294780,5296260," with lines,"
5296260,5296660," right,"
5296660,5296920," so,"
5296920,5297640," with lines,"
5297640,5298860," uh,"
5298860,5299280," there we go,"
5299400,5299640," so,"
5299640,5300520," we can kind of,"
5300520,5302900," I'm not sure if you can see that,"
5302900,5303240," but,"
5303240,5304760," yeah,"
5304760,5306520," so,"
5306520,5307400," can I increase,"
5307400,5308500," I can't increase that,"
5308500,5308760," but,"
5308760,5310180," here it is,"
5310180,5310720," right,"
5310720,5311020," oh,"
5311020,5312840," I can probably zoom in myself,"
5312840,5313280," right,"
5313280,5313960," so,"
5313960,5315120," this is how it started,"
5315120,5316480," it started from here,"
5316480,5318380," and it dropped very quickly,"
5318380,5319540," um,"
5319540,5320380," to here,"
5320380,5322140," around 10,000,"
5322140,5322620," I suppose,"
5322620,5323000," yeah,"
5323000,5324400," around 10,000 iterations,"
5324400,5325240," so,"
5325240,5325420," it's,"
5325420,5326660," this is the amount of iterations,"
5326660,5327980," and this is the cost function,"
5327980,5328220," right,"
5328220,5328500," so,"
5328500,5328760," that,"
5328900,5329460," drive it,"
5329460,5329920," and then,"
5329920,5331680," it started to slow down,"
5331680,5332040," more,"
5332040,5332400," and more,"
5332400,5332760," and more,"
5332760,5333100," and more,"
5333100,5334220," it's sort of like,"
5334220,5334440," uh,"
5334440,5336640," it looks like 1 over x,"
5336640,5337360," kind of,"
5337360,5339080," it kind of looks like 1 over x,"
5339080,5339200," so,"
5339200,5340360," this is basically how the,"
5340360,5342120," the cost function was decreasing,"
5342120,5343040," or something,"
5343040,5344220," uh,"
5344220,5344720," right,"
5344720,5346660," it would be kind of cool,"
5346660,5347320," right,"
5347320,5348800," it would be kind of cool,"
5348800,5351740," if this was actually a graphical application,"
5351740,5352740," that start,"
5352740,5354260," startups the window,"
5354260,5354800," like,"
5354800,5355040," maybe,"
5355040,5355440," like,"
5355440,5356260," SDL window,"
5356260,5356540," and,"
5356540,5356740," like,"
5356740,5357840," draws this,"
5357840,5358400," uh,"
5358400,5358680," cost,"
5358680,5359100," uh,"
5359100,5359500," function,"
5359500,5360640," in real time,"
5360640,5361380," as it learns,"
5361380,5363240," that would have been actually kind of cool,"
5363240,5364020," but that might take,"
5364020,5364180," like,"
5364180,5364620," an entire,"
5364620,5364900," like,"
5364900,5366880," separate stream coding this entire system,"
5366880,5367060," so,"
5367060,5368060," that's why I don't do that,"
5368060,5368960," uh,"
5368960,5369260," right,"
5369260,5369460," so,"
5369460,5370840," I know that the,"
5370840,5374180," the chat Python developers already have all of that,"
5374180,5375680," and they can do all of that in a,"
5375680,5376240," like,"
5376240,5376600," uh,"
5376600,5377160," Jupiter,"
5377160,5378520," um,"
5378520,5380240," Jupiter notebook,"
5380240,5382140," but I have a moxophobia,"
5382140,5389880," I can't use Jupiter notebooks,"
5389880,5390820," I have a moxophobia,"
5390820,5392900," do you guys know what is a moxophobia?"
5392900,5393780," Uh,"
5393780,5393960," I,"
5393960,5395000," I forgot how it's spelled,"
5395000,5396100," a moxophobia,"
5396100,5396540," phobia,"
5396540,5397560," yeah,"
5397560,5399780," um,"
5399780,5403620," it's a,"
5403620,5405760," it's a fear of Jupiters,"
5405760,5409220," it's a thing,"
5409220,5410660," there is a phobia,"
5410660,5416060," there is a phobia for Jupiters,"
5416060,5416960," uh,"
5416960,5417860," have you seen the Jupiter,"
5417860,5418780," uh,"
5418780,5419620," Jupiter,"
5419620,5421940," have you seen the Jupiter?"
5421940,5424220," This shit is fucking scary,"
5424220,5424520," like,"
5424520,5425160," I'm gonna show,"
5425160,5425480," I'm gonna,"
5425480,5426680," I'm gonna give you moxophobia,"
5426680,5427600," I'm gonna,"
5427600,5429320," I'm gonna give you moxophobia right now,"
5429320,5430660," um,"
5430660,5432040," do you know,"
5432040,5434400," that the size of this red,"
5434400,5435760," great red spot,"
5435760,5437260," is bigger than,"
5437260,5438340," earth,"
5438340,5439640," like,"
5439780,5441280," this little thing,"
5441280,5443200," on the surface of the Jupiter,"
5443200,5445580," is bigger than fucking earth,"
5445580,5445820," it,"
5445820,5447900," it can devour this entire earth,"
5447900,5448440," easy,"
5448440,5450740," like,"
5450740,5451320," tell me,"
5451320,5453240," how you don't have a moxophobia?"
5453240,5454440," Like,"
5454440,5454880," I do,"
5454880,5456220," this shit is fucking scary,"
5456220,5457000," it's just like this,"
5457000,5458020," sort of,"
5458020,5459380," lawcraft,"
5459380,5461040," lovecraft style,"
5461040,5462000," like a demon,"
5462000,5463700," that can devour entire world,"
5463700,5464660," right,"
5464660,5465600," and it's nearby,"
5465600,5467480," it's in the same solar system,"
5467480,5468500," like,"
5468900,5470780," it's fucking scary,"
5470780,5473660," now you have moxophobia,"
5473660,5474620," anyway,"
5474620,5475440," you're welcome,"
5475440,5479100," so,"
5479100,5479320," yeah,"
5479320,5483740," nearby,"
5483740,5488180," yeah,"
5488180,5488660," I know,"
5488660,5488940," it's,"
5488940,5489780," it's pretty far away,"
5489780,5490000," so,"
5490000,5491520," the scale of the solar system,"
5491520,5493060," is actually bigger than people think,"
5493060,5493340," right,"
5493400,5493640," so,"
5493640,5496940," usually the pop science visualizations,"
5496940,5497420," kind of,"
5497420,5499140," show things,"
5499140,5500960," too close to each other,"
5500960,5501680," in reality,"
5501680,5502560," they are way more,"
5502560,5503220," like,"
5503220,5503740," far apart,"
5503740,5503960," but,"
5503960,5504200," yeah,"
5504200,5506320," you need a bias,"
5506320,5507140," because the model,"
5507140,5507760," without it,"
5507760,5509300," could not fit the data better,"
5509300,5509660," it,"
5509660,5510340," like,"
5510340,5510780," fits,"
5510780,5511520," the,"
5511780,5513620," fit the parabola with the line,"
5513620,5513860," yeah,"
5513860,5513980," yeah,"
5513980,5514160," yeah,"
5514160,5514420," so,"
5514420,5515540," like,"
5515540,5516260," okay,"
5516260,5518940," I'm gonna explain you how my ooga-booga brain,"
5518940,5520800," understands that,"
5520800,5521420," right,"
5521420,5522180," so,"
5522180,5523480," if you don't have a bias,"
5523480,5525920," if you don't have a bias,"
5526360,5528460," the model can only,"
5528460,5529580," uh,"
5529580,5530960," modify the,"
5530960,5531660," uh,"
5531660,5532600," the output,"
5532600,5534980," only based on the parameters,"
5534980,5536860," only based on the parameters,"
5536860,5539420," but as soon as you add a bias,"
5539420,5540060," it,"
5540060,5540740," uh,"
5540740,5543940," the model is capable of taking the entire state,"
5543940,5545680," and shifting it around,"
5545680,5547500," regardless of the inputs,"
5547500,5548540," right,"
5548540,5548740," so,"
5548740,5549960," this one little parameter,"
5549960,5551240," doesn't depend on any of the inputs,"
5551240,5551640," so,"
5551640,5552940," the learning process can now,"
5552940,5553960," take this entire thing,"
5553960,5555200," and move it around,"
5555200,5556000," left and right,"
5556160,5558880," this is how my stupid ooga-booga brain understands that,"
5558880,5559860," right,"
5559860,5560300," I,"
5560300,5564100," I don't know how to do these fancy words of fitting parameter,"
5564100,5565060," regression stuff,"
5565060,5566180," I don't understand that,"
5566180,5566880," but for me,"
5566880,5568000," it's just like simple parameter,"
5568000,5568840," and it's,"
5568840,5569400," if it's negative,"
5569400,5570940," I can move this entire thing to the left,"
5570940,5571700," and it's positive,"
5571700,5573120," I can move this entire thing to the right,"
5573120,5574820," if I didn't have that parameter,"
5574820,5575520," I couldn't,"
5575520,5576820," I won't be able to do that,"
5576820,5577760," uh,"
5577760,5578420," Raphael,"
5578420,5578660," hello,"
5578660,5579040," what's up,"
5579040,5579300," what's up,"
5579300,5581060," so,"
5581060,5581220," yeah,"
5581220,5581540," for me,"
5581540,5583020," it's like this sort of like upset,"
5583020,5583760," so,"
5583760,5584040," I,"
5584040,5585200," I do understand that,"
5585200,5585420," like,"
5585440,5586340," I'm a stupid developer,"
5586340,5587080," don't understand,"
5587080,5587320," like,"
5587320,5589560," these high-level mathematical things,"
5589560,5591060," but this is how I understand,"
5591060,5591920," right,"
5591920,5593120," maybe it's too simplistic,"
5593120,5594420," um,"
5598240,5601460," so,"
5601460,5601600," yeah,"
5601600,5601840," anyway,"
5601840,5603340," here's an interesting thing,"
5603340,5606680," and this is where the cool part comes in,"
5606680,5608380," very cool part,"
5608380,5611640," that actually even scares me a little bit,"
5611640,5613380," I don't know what to tell you,"
5613380,5614620," I don't know what to tell you,"
5614620,5616060," so,"
5616420,5618760," so,"
5618760,5618800," so,"
5618800,5621500," it's not that dramatic as I'm gonna show it,"
5621500,5621880," but,"
5621880,5622140," yeah,"
5622140,5622540," okay,"
5622540,5623020," so,"
5623020,5623780," here's the or,"
5623780,5624300," right,"
5624300,5625240," here's the or part,"
5625240,5626320," uh,"
5626320,5627160," now,"
5627160,5628740," I'm gonna go to my cost function,"
5628740,5629540," and I'm gonna say,"
5629540,5630000," okay,"
5630000,5631000," uh,"
5631000,5632260," let's actually change the data,"
5632260,5633320," what if instead of or,"
5633320,5634620," I want end,"
5634620,5635340," so,"
5635340,5636240," in case of an end,"
5636240,5638000," I'm gonna do it like that,"
5638000,5638820," right,"
5638820,5639720," uh,"
5639720,5641760," and we're gonna try to train it for a little bit,"
5641760,5642640," and this,"
5642640,5644420," the flipper acts like end now,"
5644420,5649700," I never explicitly told it to be or,"
5649700,5651000," or end,"
5651000,5652980," I just coded,"
5652980,5656940," like a description of the behavior of this element,"
5656940,5658040," and it just like,"
5658040,5658620," like,"
5658620,5659400," um,"
5659400,5660780," tweaked parameters around,"
5660780,5663120," and it came up with a thing that acts like that,"
5663120,5664300," so,"
5664300,5665580," it's,"
5665580,5667640," it's a very simple thing,"
5667640,5668200," right,"
5668200,5669420," it's a very simple thing,"
5669720,5670220," uh,"
5670220,5671280," but I never,"
5671280,5674800," set up any of this configuration myself,"
5674800,5677040," I just explained it what I want,"
5677040,5680160," and sort of like a portal from other dimension appeared,"
5680160,5682200," and this element that I wanted,"
5682200,5683260," appeared,"
5683260,5684780," out of that portal,"
5684780,5685820," right,"
5685820,5686520," I only said,"
5686520,5687360," I want that,"
5687360,5688380," and it's just like,"
5688380,5688640," it,"
5688640,5689320," it found it here,"
5689320,5689540," this,"
5689540,5690280," this is what you wanted,"
5690280,5691420," this is probably what you wanted,"
5691420,5691900," there you go,"
5691900,5693680," this is so fascinating,"
5693680,5694720," but at the same time,"
5694720,5697120," it's not always gonna be exactly what you want,"
5697120,5697420," right,"
5697420,5697880," it's like,"
5697880,5698740," uh,"
5698960,5699500," asking,"
5699500,5700460," uh,"
5700460,5702660," genie to grant you wishes,"
5702660,5704020," if you know what I mean,"
5704020,5704760," right,"
5704760,5707280," if you're fucked up anywhere,"
5707280,5708680," in your description of,"
5708680,5709480," of your wish,"
5709480,5711280," the genie is gonna fuck you,"
5711280,5712640," that's right,"
5712640,5713480," so,"
5713480,5717380," genies are actually very,"
5717380,5719200," very wild,"
5719200,5720200," vile creatures,"
5720200,5720740," right,"
5720740,5721400," so,"
5721400,5722660," they're gonna take,"
5722660,5724880," they're gonna rule lawyer your wish,"
5724880,5726180," to their advantage,"
5726180,5729440," and this is what these machine learning algorithms are,"
5729440,5730500," they're like genius,"
5730500,5730800," right,"
5730800,5731260," so you,"
5731260,5731940," you be,"
5731940,5734660," you have to be very careful with what you're asking for,"
5734660,5735940," uh,"
5735940,5736440," yeah,"
5736440,5741640," so we can also try to train this entire thing for other things,"
5741640,5741940," right,"
5741940,5742680," so as far as I know,"
5742680,5744340," it can even do,"
5744340,5744900," uh,"
5744900,5745860," NAND gate,"
5745860,5746180," right,"
5746180,5746940," so this is like,"
5746940,5747220," um,"
5747220,5748960," this is AND gate,"
5748960,5751020," so we can also do NAND gate,"
5751020,5751320," right,"
5751320,5752760," and NAND gate is basically AND,"
5752760,5754600," but all of these things are inverted,"
5754600,5755100," right,"
5755140,5756280," so you can essentially,"
5756280,5757160," uh,"
5757160,5758560," just invert this entire thing,"
5758560,5759420," uh,"
5759420,5759720," right,"
5759720,5761400," and it still will be able to,"
5761400,5762520," to actually model that,"
5762520,5762960," right,"
5762960,5763420," as you can see,"
5763420,5764080," it modeled that,"
5764080,5765880," so this is the NAND gate now,"
5765880,5766520," right,"
5766520,5767120," so it's AND,"
5767120,5767340," but,"
5767340,5767720," uh,"
5767720,5768320," with negating,"
5768320,5770080," so the fun part,"
5770080,5771520," starts,"
5771520,5773600," when you ask it,"
5773600,5773840," okay,"
5773840,5774780," what about ZOR,"
5774780,5776460," ZOR is a very cool,"
5776460,5777480," uh,"
5777480,5778120," you know,"
5778120,5779220," very cool,"
5779220,5779880," um,"
5779880,5780920," gate,"
5780920,5782140," can I model that,"
5782140,5782800," so,"
5782800,5783740," with zeros,"
5783740,5784700," it's zero,"
5784880,5786060," if one of them is one,"
5786060,5786940," it's going to be one,"
5786940,5788680," when both of them are one,"
5788680,5789500," it's going to be zero,"
5789500,5794720," so you can think about ZOR actually adding up two numbers,"
5794720,5795160," right,"
5795160,5795680," so here,"
5795680,5796360," uh,"
5796360,5797400," is the sum of the numbers,"
5797400,5797680," right,"
5797680,5799480," zero plus zero is zero,"
5799480,5801380," one plus zero is one,"
5801380,5802640," zero plus one is one,"
5802640,5804960," one plus one is going to be two,"
5804960,5805920," but the last digit,"
5805920,5806900," the overflow digit,"
5806900,5807340," uh,"
5807340,5808640," got basically thrown away,"
5808640,5809680," right,"
5809680,5810780," so we,"
5810780,5811840," we threw away the,"
5811840,5812860," the overflow digit,"
5812860,5814420," and we only left with this thing,"
5814620,5816320," so it's just like overflowing,"
5816320,5817300," um,"
5817300,5817640," it's a,"
5817640,5817880," it's a,"
5817880,5818880," it's a sum of a,"
5818880,5819500," of a single,"
5819500,5819900," uh,"
5819900,5820660," of a single bit,"
5820660,5821920," right,"
5821920,5823860," so we're going to try to do this entire thing,"
5823860,5826520," and it didn't really find anything,"
5826520,5827060," maybe we,"
5827060,5828300," we just need to run it more,"
5828300,5830460," let's actually take a look at how it evolves,"
5830460,5831740," right,"
5831740,5833220," how it evolves,"
5833220,5835320," so let me see,"
5835320,5836880," uh,"
5837000,5838660," and it kind of stagnates at,"
5838660,5840340," at the quarter of the,"
5840340,5841540," here's the cost function,"
5841540,5842800," it kind of stagnates at the quarter,"
5842800,5843340," right,"
5843340,5843500," it,"
5843500,5844860," it kept decreasing the,"
5844860,5845560," uh,"
5845560,5846040," the weights,"
5846040,5846520," right,"
5846520,5847880," and it didn't really go anywhere,"
5847880,5850240," and no matter how many times you,"
5850240,5850760," uh,"
5850760,5851840," actually try to do that,"
5851840,5853800," you basically will get stuck"
5853800,5855180," at nothing,"
5855180,5857200," and this is because,"
5857200,5857860," uh,"
5857860,5858980," as far as I know,"
5858980,5862060," Zor element is not modelable"
5862060,5863960," by a single neuron,"
5863960,5864700," right,"
5864700,5866700," a single neuron is not enough"
5866700,5867460," to model,"
5867460,5868420," uh,"
5868420,5869380," Zor element,"
5869380,5870280," right,"
5870280,5871780," so this is because,"
5871780,5873900," again,"
5873900,5876020," I'm a stupid ooga-booga developer,"
5876020,5876720," right,"
5876720,5878180," I'm a stupid ooga-booga developer,"
5878180,5879440," but as far as I know,"
5879440,5880160," um,"
5880160,5882540," so a single neuron,"
5882540,5885000," a single neuron can basically classify"
5885000,5887260," things on two sides of the line,"
5887260,5887500," right,"
5887500,5888320," because what it does,"
5888320,5888600," it just,"
5888600,5888840," like,"
5888840,5890160," models a single line,"
5890160,5891000," right,"
5891000,5891760," so,"
5891760,5893020," but Zor has,"
5893020,5893280," like,"
5893280,5895240," values on different parts,"
5895240,5895480," like,"
5895480,5896500," it's not enough"
5896500,5897520," to,"
5897520,5898020," to,"
5898020,5898780," to classify,"
5898780,5899480," uh,"
5899480,5900320," Zor like that,"
5900320,5901400," I don't know what the fuck"
5901400,5902200," I'm talking about,"
5902200,5903200," so I still don't understand"
5903200,5904080," why you can't do,"
5904080,5904760," do Zor"
5904760,5906040," with a single neuron,"
5906040,5907320," so yeah,"
5907320,5909360," maybe we can google that up,"
5909360,5911280," uh,"
5911280,5912280," Zor"
5912280,5913860," with Zor"
5913860,5914820," neural network"
5914820,5916300," with a single,"
5916300,5917680," uh,"
5917680,5918140," neuron,"
5918140,5919040," right,"
5919040,5921700," that's the right intuition though,"
5921700,5921880," oh,"
5921880,5922240," thank you,"
5922240,5923380," so we don't have to google anything,"
5923380,5923700," okay,"
5923700,5923980," perfect,"
5923980,5924840," okay,"
5924840,5925260," so,"
5925260,5925980," um,"
5925980,5928960," but here is an interesting thing,"
5928960,5930760," here is an interesting thing,"
5930760,5931740," uh,"
5931740,5933020," you can"
5933020,5934860," describe"
5934860,5936420," Zor element"
5936420,5937640," in terms of"
5937640,5938860," non-Zor elements,"
5938860,5939200," you can,"
5939200,5940380," you can describe it"
5940380,5941160," in terms of"
5941160,5941580," and,"
5941580,5942360," uh,"
5942360,5942960," nand"
5942960,5943720," and or,"
5943720,5944580," right,"
5944580,5945880," so we can google that up,"
5945880,5946760," Zor in"
5946760,5948160," terms of,"
5948160,5948640," uh,"
5948640,5949260," and,"
5949260,5950660," or,"
5950660,5951240," right,"
5951240,5952080," can we find anything,"
5952080,5952880," so I remember,"
5952880,5953240," like,"
5953240,5954720," we want to find the formula,"
5954720,5956120," uh,"
5956180,5957340," Zor and the other,"
5957340,5958300," okay,"
5958300,5960540," so bitwise operator"
5960540,5962040," from only or"
5962040,5962440," and,"
5962440,5963600," and,"
5963600,5966940," okay,"
5966940,5971540," so this is the minus,"
5971660,5972440," but we don't really"
5972440,5973280," have a minus,"
5973280,5974880," that,"
5974880,5975400," why,"
5975400,5976960," why minus,"
5976960,5977300," like,"
5977300,5978800," how is that a good answer,"
5978800,5980440," you suggesting minus,"
5980440,5982660," my god,"
5982660,5985280," uh,"
5985280,5987560," yeah,"
5987560,5987980," that's a,"
5987980,5988780," that's a good one,"
5988780,5989720," that's another one,"
5989720,5991460," essentially,"
5991460,5994260," um,"
5994260,5995300," let's try google,"
5995300,5997060," because this one is useless,"
5997060,6002940," so I remember"
6002940,6004400," there was one,"
6004400,6005060," uh,"
6005060,6006580," is Zor"
6006580,6007920," combination,"
6007920,6009840," there's one that I really liked,"
6009840,6011460," uh,"
6011460,6012980," there's one that I really liked,"
6012980,6013700," and that was,"
6013700,6014600," I think,"
6014600,6016220," uh,"
6016220,6016700," that was,"
6016700,6017500," I think,"
6017500,6018340," like,"
6018340,6018840," x,"
6018840,6020300," um,"
6020300,6022120," or y,"
6022120,6023020," x or y,"
6023020,6023980," then,"
6023980,6024960," uh,"
6024960,6026500," x and y,"
6027060,6027820," negative,"
6027820,6028180," like,"
6028180,6029140," so this is an end,"
6029140,6030380," and all of that,"
6030380,6031040," end,"
6031040,6031980," right,"
6031980,6033300," and that was Zor,"
6033300,6034400," right,"
6034400,6035760," that was Zor,"
6035760,6037000," and I really like this,"
6037000,6037360," uh,"
6037360,6037720," description,"
6037720,6038200," right,"
6038200,6039600," and I'm going to show you why,"
6039600,6040660," uh,"
6040660,6042420," so let me quickly,"
6042420,6043560," uh,"
6043560,6044620," maybe do,"
6044620,6045300," uh,"
6045300,6046120," do this thing,"
6046120,6048320," I want to confirm that this is actually Zor,"
6048320,6049120," uh,"
6049120,6050200," I want to quickly confirm,"
6050200,6051580," we can easily confirm that,"
6051580,6051800," right,"
6051800,6052740," so we can just iterate,"
6052740,6053780," uh,"
6053780,6054300," size,"
6054300,6055720," x,"
6055720,6056240," zero,"
6056240,6056960," x less than,"
6057060,6057160," two,"
6057160,6057380," plus,"
6057380,6057840," plus x,"
6057840,6058880," uh,"
6058880,6059280," right,"
6059280,6061640," and this is going to be y,"
6061640,6062520," y,"
6062520,6065440," and we can just print all of it,"
6065440,6065920," right,"
6065920,6066440," so,"
6066440,6067460," z,"
6067460,6067940," u,"
6067940,6069280," Zor,"
6069280,6069740," z,"
6069740,6070080," u,"
6070080,6070540," equal,"
6070540,6070840," z,"
6070840,6071080," u,"
6071080,6073740," so x or y,"
6073740,6075300," we've got that,"
6075300,6076220," and"
6076220,6079900," x and y,"
6079900,6082840," will that work?"
6082840,6084080," That's a good question."
6086360,6086860," git,"
6086860,6086960," git,"
6086960,6086960," git,"
6086960,6089080," uh,"
6089080,6090260," so what you,"
6090260,6090620," yeah,"
6090620,6092460," so we also have to provide this thing,"
6092460,6093980," uh,"
6093980,6096040," okay,"
6096040,6096600," that worked,"
6096600,6097960," so that's one,"
6097960,6098880," uh,"
6098880,6099860," all the descriptions,"
6099860,6100460," uh,"
6100460,6101520," all the descriptions of Zor,"
6101520,6101940," right,"
6101940,6102840," uh,"
6102840,6103840," and I kind of like this one,"
6103840,6104400," right,"
6104400,6107120," because you have three,"
6107120,6109340," three elements in here,"
6109340,6110580," you have or,"
6110580,6111620," uh,"
6111620,6112220," nand,"
6112220,6113960," and end,"
6113960,6116060," and as I already demonstrated,"
6116060,6120440," all the three are modelable by a single neuron,"
6120440,6121280," right,"
6121280,6123240," so we already demonstrated that,"
6123240,6124260," so if we switch to,"
6124260,6124900," uh,"
6124900,6125300," to here,"
6125300,6125740," right,"
6125740,6127400," so let's go ahead and just do that,"
6127400,6128260," um,"
6128260,6130040," so maybe I'm going to have,"
6130040,6131080," so this is the,"
6131080,6132480," uh,"
6132480,6133760," let's put or in here,"
6133880,6135140," so this is going to be one,"
6135140,6135960," one,"
6135960,6136420," one,"
6136420,6136840," so,"
6136840,6138500," or train,"
6138500,6146660," so let's say that the train is going to be essentially four,"
6146660,6148360," so it has these four,"
6148360,6149320," and,"
6149320,6149880," uh,"
6149880,6150920," the actual,"
6150920,6152680," uh,"
6152680,6153600," train in here,"
6153600,6154020," right,"
6154020,6156940," so it's going to be train point,"
6156940,6157320," uh,"
6157320,6159200," two,"
6159200,6159720," three,"
6159720,6162740," and I'm not even sure how,"
6163020,6165840," better describe this entire thing,"
6165840,6166780," uh,"
6166780,6167960," I want to say,"
6167960,6171140," that we have a,"
6171140,6171360," like,"
6171360,6171940," yeah,"
6171940,6172960," goddamn C,"
6172960,6174160," C makes it kind of difficult,"
6174160,6175520," so I want to have a pointer,"
6175520,6176540," to,"
6176540,6177540," uh,"
6177540,6179080," an array of three elements,"
6179080,6181520," pointer to an array of three elements,"
6181520,6184080," and I don't really know how syntactically describe that,"
6184080,6185240," because it's goddamn C,"
6185240,6186320," right,"
6186320,6188080," so one of the things I can probably do,"
6188080,6189100," I can do type def,"
6189100,6189900," where I can say,"
6189900,6190200," okay,"
6190200,6190800," float,"
6190800,6191800," uh,"
6191800,6192320," three,"
6192600,6193100," and let's say,"
6193100,6194420," it's a sample,"
6194420,6194900," right,"
6194900,6195920," something like sample,"
6195920,6197160," and here,"
6197160,6197720," I can say,"
6197720,6198800," we have an array of,"
6198800,6199060," like,"
6199060,6199660," of samples,"
6199660,6200200," and here,"
6200200,6201100," and here,"
6201100,6201640," I have a,"
6201640,6203180," just a pointer to the sample,"
6203180,6205300," so I think it's a little bit easier,"
6205300,6206260," to,"
6206260,6207060," to do it like that,"
6207060,6207620," because then,"
6207620,6210380," I'll be able to switch between different training sets,"
6210380,6211160," if you know what I mean,"
6211160,6212840," so this one could be,"
6212840,6213140," like,"
6213140,6213480," four,"
6213480,6214860," uh,"
6214860,6215700," or what not,"
6215700,6216440," right,"
6216440,6218740," so I think that's kind of cool,"
6218740,6219840," because now,"
6219840,6220300," right,"
6220300,6221080," I want to be able to just,"
6221080,6221240," like,"
6221240,6222420," literally switch between them,"
6222420,6222820," right,"
6222820,6223400," so then,"
6223400,6224780," this is going to be end,"
6224780,6225880," uh,"
6225880,6226180," right,"
6226180,6226580," in here,"
6226580,6228820," all of them are zeros,"
6228820,6229460," right,"
6229460,6230460," all of them are zeros,"
6230460,6231540," and then,"
6231540,6233660," nand is basically that,"
6233660,6235860," but zeros become ones,"
6235860,6237060," right,"
6237060,6238580," zeros become ones,"
6238580,6239840," and one become zero,"
6239840,6240700," right,"
6240700,6241880," so we're going to start with or,"
6241880,6242880," uh,"
6242880,6243300," right,"
6243480,6243940," so,"
6243940,6243980," so,"
6243980,6243980," so,"
6243980,6247320," I suppose maybe that's what you want,"
6247320,6248600," yeah,"
6248600,6249340," that's what you want,"
6249340,6250600," okay,"
6250600,6250880," cool,"
6250880,6252420," so it had a warning in here,"
6252420,6253360," because,"
6253360,6253980," uh,"
6253980,6254200," yeah,"
6254200,6255840," we don't have a return zero in here,"
6255840,6259180," and let's not print any tracing,"
6259180,6261680," so it doesn't slow down in the,"
6261680,6262520," in this thing,"
6262620,6262800," okay,"
6262800,6263660," so this is or,"
6263660,6264360," right,"
6264360,6265060," this is or,"
6265060,6266420," uh-huh,"
6266420,6267880," then I switch to end,"
6267880,6270740," this is end,"
6270740,6272000," we can clearly see,"
6272000,6272500," so zero,"
6272500,6272760," zero,"
6272760,6273000," zero,"
6273000,6273440," one,"
6273440,6274380," and,"
6274380,6274660," uh,"
6274660,6275320," this is nand,"
6275320,6276100," right,"
6276100,6281940," so all of the three are modelable by a single neuron,"
6281940,6282500," right,"
6282500,6283320," uh,"
6283320,6284600," we know that for a fact,"
6284600,6285500," so,"
6285500,6286040," and,"
6286040,6286500," uh,"
6286500,6287820," essentially how we can,"
6287820,6289440," uh,"
6289440,6290480," we can describe,"
6290480,6294060," how can we build an architecture of this neural network,"
6294060,6294720," right,"
6294720,6296040," so we have two inputs,"
6296040,6298180," like x and y,"
6298180,6298700," right,"
6298700,6300060," so we have x and y,"
6300060,6301380," so,"
6301380,6303420," and then we have a layer,"
6303420,6304160," right,"
6304160,6305920," the first element of which,"
6306100,6306720," supposedly,"
6306720,6307120," right,"
6307120,6307620," supposedly,"
6307620,6308520," is,"
6308520,6308880," uh,"
6308880,6309760," essentially or,"
6309760,6310980," so this is or,"
6310980,6312040," uh,"
6312040,6312820," this one,"
6312820,6314020," uh,"
6314020,6314940," just a second,"
6314940,6317060," uh,"
6317060,6319620," this one is supposed to be nand,"
6319620,6320800," nand,"
6320800,6325320," and then we get the last neuron here,"
6325320,6327240," which is supposed to be and,"
6327240,6328860," right,"
6328860,6329640," so,"
6329640,6331220," and how are we supposed to connect them?"
6331220,6332240," We take x,"
6332240,6333260," uh,"
6333260,6334400," we feed it into or,"
6334400,6335400," and we take y,"
6335520,6336720," and we feed it into or,"
6336720,6338780," then we take x and y,"
6338780,6340000," feed them into nand,"
6340000,6341100," there we go,"
6341100,6345300," and we've got two values that we then feed into the final end,"
6345300,6348060," and we're gonna get the y as the final result,"
6348060,6348740," right,"
6348740,6353680," so this is basic architecture of this neural network,"
6353680,6355380," and its justification,"
6355380,6357320," so here's an interesting thing,"
6357420,6361580," I'm not saying that these specific neurons are gonna be or,"
6361580,6362440," nand,"
6362440,6363380," and end,"
6363380,6364460," I'm not saying that,"
6364460,6368740," I'm saying that this is one of the ways to organize this circuit,"
6368740,6375220," and let's just allocate enough neurons for a neural network to potentially organize it like that,"
6375300,6376820," if it organizes it differently,"
6376820,6378560," it's none of our business,"
6378560,6379160," right,"
6379160,6381120," maybe it will find a better configuration,"
6381120,6383040," maybe it will just use something else in here,"
6383040,6383860," right,"
6383860,6384600," so,"
6384600,6385680," it doesn't matter,"
6385680,6392560," we use these specific gates as a justification for this specific architecture,"
6392560,6393360," we allocate,"
6393520,6393700," okay,"
6393700,6396520," so this is how many of these things it probably needs,"
6396520,6398020," so let's just give it,"
6398020,6400540," give this amount of things to the model,"
6400540,6401360," right,"
6401360,6402280," so,"
6402280,6405200," and that's why we're gonna be organizing it like that,"
6405200,6406560," so,"
6406560,6408240," so as you can see,"
6408240,6412600," we gradually bump up the amount of parameters,"
6412600,6413260," right,"
6413260,6414680," and here's an interesting thing,"
6414680,6416660," each of these neurons,"
6416660,6417080," right,"
6417080,6418920," so we have three neurons in here,"
6418920,6419240," right,"
6419240,6419980," so this is one,"
6419980,6420280," two,"
6420280,6420760," and three,"
6420760,6421980," this is another neuron,"
6421980,6423220," because this is just an input,"
6423520,6428940," so in each of them are going to have its own weight and bias,"
6428940,6430580," so this one is going to have two weights,"
6430580,6431300," V,"
6431300,6431980," W1,"
6431980,6432720," W2,"
6432720,6433820," and bias,"
6433820,6434180," right,"
6434180,6435340," so for these two inputs,"
6435340,6437460," and this one is going to have W1,"
6437460,6438180," W2,"
6438180,6438900," and bias,"
6438900,6439440," right,"
6439440,6442380," and this one is also going to have its own W1,"
6442380,6443560," W2,"
6443560,6444120," and bias,"
6444120,6446600," so here we have nine parameters,"
6446600,6448200," right,"
6448200,6450360," so we went from one parameter,"
6450360,6451460," two parameters,"
6451460,6452820," then three,"
6453180,6455280," for modeling the gates and stuff like that,"
6455280,6457160," now we have nine parameters,"
6457160,6459840," so we're even closer to one trillion parameters,"
6459840,6461100," so as you can see,"
6461100,6464520," we're just like piling more and more parameters into the model,"
6464520,6466200," and it becomes more and more powerful,"
6466200,6469760," it's capable of modeling more and more sophisticated things,"
6469760,6471620," and here is an interesting thing,"
6471920,6479720," so essentially you can think of this entire approach as automatic circuit design,"
6479900,6480480," right,"
6480480,6481600," so for instance,"
6481600,6484980," what if you have like a truth table of a summer,"
6484980,6486720," a thing that sums up,"
6486720,6487840," for example,"
6487840,6488400," I don't know,"
6488400,6490480," four bits,"
6490480,6493160," and you just define a bunch of truth table,"
6493160,6498240," and you allocate enough neurons to design that circuit,"
6498380,6500460," and you just give it to the machine learning algorithm,"
6500460,6504540," and it will find like a good configuration that actually sums up two things,"
6504540,6506300," you can actually build circuits out of that,"
6506300,6507740," like literal circuits that do things,"
6507740,6509080," I mean,"
6509080,6510920," so why not,"
6510920,6511500," right,"
6511540,6513040," why design a circuit yourself,"
6513040,6513480," right,"
6513480,6516080," if you can just like feed a truth table into that,"
6516080,6518720," and it will find the configuration of that truth table for you,"
6518720,6522080," and all gates will be NAND,"
6522080,6522380," yeah,"
6522380,6522820," exactly,"
6522820,6525540," there is a thing about the logic,"
6525540,6530320," the boolean logic is that you can describe any element as NAND,"
6530320,6533420," you can build like any circuit with only NAND elements,"
6533420,6534380," I heard about that,"
6534380,6536660," so,"
6536660,6541520," but we're modeling only like digital circuits and stuff like that,"
6541540,6543800," but we can model anything,"
6543800,6544620," right,"
6544620,6545460," so,"
6545460,6547220," this is like a universal circuits,"
6547220,6547440," right,"
6547440,6550440," if you have data to train this thing on,"
6550440,6551780," you can just do it,"
6551780,6554460," anyways,"
6554460,6555380," anyways,"
6555380,6556180," so,"
6556180,6558940," let's try to code this entire thing,"
6558940,6559400," again,"
6559400,6563580," I'm not going to be using mattresses or derivatives or any of that nerdy shit,"
6563580,6564640," all right,"
6564640,6565280," for now,"
6565280,6566040," right,"
6566040,6569280," we're going to keep the level of nerdiness down,"
6569280,6571520," I know it's kind of hard on my channel,"
6571540,6573140," but that's what we're trying to do,"
6573140,6574140," so,"
6574140,6578440," I'm going to create a separate file in here,"
6578440,6578780," right,"
6578780,6580880," so,"
6580880,6581680," okay,"
6581680,6582660," so,"
6582660,6584440," we need nine parameters,"
6584440,6585540," right,"
6585540,6587080," we need nine parameters,"
6587080,6587280," so,"
6587280,6591080," let's actually create a structure for the ZOR model,"
6591080,6591840," right,"
6591840,6592600," for the ZOR model,"
6593200,6593440," so,"
6593440,6594060," and essentially,"
6594060,6596880," we're going to roughly say that this is the,"
6596880,6597440," like,"
6597440,6600020," first layer is going to be OR and NAND,"
6600020,6602280," and the second layer is going to be NAND,"
6602280,6602980," right,"
6602980,6607860," and let's just like allocate neuron per this element,"
6607860,6608500," per this gate,"
6609000,6609200," so,"
6609200,6609240," so,"
6609240,6616100," we're going to have OR W1 or W2 and then OR bias,"
6616100,6616600," so,"
6616600,6617700," this is for the first one,"
6617700,6619020," then,"
6619020,6620740," for the second one,"
6620740,6621440," which is NAND,"
6621440,6623220," we're going to allocate another one,"
6623220,6624320," and then,"
6624320,6625520," for the last one,"
6625520,6626660," right,"
6626660,6628920," we're going to do AND,"
6629160,6629680," so,"
6629680,6630980," this is our model,"
6630980,6631680," right,"
6631680,6635040," this is our model that has three neurons,"
6635040,6635680," right,"
6635680,6636500," and actually,"
6636500,6638140," two layers,"
6638140,6640220," the first layer consists of these two neurons,"
6640220,6642160," and the last layer consists of this neuron,"
6642160,6642800," right,"
6642800,6644080," so,"
6644080,6645840," and we need a function that,"
6645840,6648460," given inputs X and Y,"
6648460,6652240," just basically feeds this X and Y into,"
6652240,6655420," into the neural network and spits out the final result,"
6655420,6655680," so,"
6655680,6657900," this kind of operation in neural networks,"
6657900,6658600," as far as you know,"
6658660,6659660," it's called forwarding,"
6659660,6659940," so,"
6659940,6662020," we can define something like forward,"
6662020,6662520," right,"
6662520,6662720," so,"
6662720,6666100," we're feeding data in forward into the neural network,"
6666100,6667380," right,"
6667380,6667580," so,"
6667580,6668700," it's going to return float,"
6668700,6669020," right,"
6669020,6670460," it's going to return like a single valium,"
6670460,6672560," it's going to accept the model itself,"
6672560,6672880," right,"
6672880,6673040," so,"
6673040,6673620," this is the model,"
6673620,6675700," and the inputs X and Y,"
6675700,6676700," right,"
6676700,6678480," so,"
6678480,6680220," first,"
6680220,6681960," we're going to feed it into OR,"
6681960,6682460," right,"
6682460,6683880," we're feeding that into OR,"
6683880,6684560," so,"
6684560,6685060," that means,"
6685060,6687460," I do OR W1,"
6687620,6688900," multiply by X,"
6688900,6693180," plus M or W2,"
6693180,6694420," multiply by Y,"
6694420,6695660," multiply by Y,"
6695660,6697980," plus OR bias,"
6697980,6698540," right,"
6698540,6699360," and this is our,"
6699360,6700520," sort of like a first value,"
6700520,6700940," so,"
6700940,6701760," this is going to be A,"
6701760,6703200," right,"
6703200,6704440," so,"
6704440,6704980," then,"
6704980,6706480," we repeat this entire process,"
6706480,6708080," but for NAND,"
6708080,6709040," right,"
6709040,6710400," right,"
6710400,6712920," and here we have two intermediate values in here,"
6712920,6713720," so,"
6713720,6714240," and then,"
6714240,6718140," we use these intermediate values for the final AND,"
6718140,6719520," AND gate,"
6719520,6719900," right,"
6719900,6720100," so,"
6720100,6723060," this is going to be AND W1 plus B,"
6723060,6727960," M AND W2 plus M AND B,"
6727960,6729800," and this is the final result,"
6730680,6730980," right,"
6730980,6731820," on top of that,"
6731820,6734980," we also need to squish the results of these things,"
6734980,6737900," we don't want to let them be like unbounded,"
6737900,6738580," so,"
6738580,6740280," we need the sigmoid,"
6740280,6742420," let's actually grab the sigmoid,"
6742420,6744040," put it in here,"
6744040,6744780," so,"
6744780,6746460," after we apply this thing,"
6746460,6747640," we're going to do sigmoid F,"
6749080,6752020," then sigmoid F,"
6752020,6753920," and the last one,"
6753920,6754720," sigmoid here,"
6754720,6755260," and here,"
6755260,6755960," so,"
6755960,6756420," as you can see,"
6756420,6756660," so,"
6756660,6758480," we feed the input into the first neuron,"
6758480,6760760," the same input into the second neuron,"
6760760,6762520," and we're finished with the first layer,"
6762520,6763020," right,"
6763020,6763220," so,"
6763220,6764620," this is sort of like the first layer,"
6764620,6765480," and then,"
6765480,6766420," for the last layer,"
6766420,6768200," we take the results of the previous layer,"
6768200,6770180," and feed them into the last neuron,"
6770180,6771940," and we're going to get the final result,"
6771940,6772600," right,"
6772600,6772940," again,"
6772940,6775000," I'm not using any neural sheet like matrices,"
6775000,6776160," or anything like that,"
6776160,6777760," I'm just doing everything manually,"
6778180,6780300," and doing it as explicitly as possible,"
6780300,6780800," there is a,"
6780800,6784580," there is explicit mapping between this architecture,"
6784580,6786580," and the actual code we put in here,"
6786580,6787140," right,"
6787140,6788220," nothing obscures,"
6788220,6789220," nothing stays in the way,"
6789220,6790140," this is how we do that,"
6790140,6790440," right,"
6790440,6791340," again,"
6791340,6792920," everything I do into this stream,"
6792920,6795060," this is not how you do that in production,"
6795060,6796020," right,"
6796020,6797520," this is not how you do that in production,"
6797520,6798100," so,"
6798100,6798680," there is more,"
6798680,6798900," if,"
6798900,6799220," like,"
6799220,6802100," efficient way of representing the neural networks,"
6802100,6803180," and doing operations,"
6803180,6804820," and forwarding through neural networks,"
6804820,6805100," right,"
6805100,6805800," so,"
6805800,6807560," this is quite important to remember,"
6807660,6807960," actually,"
6807960,6809280," this is quite important to remember,"
6809280,6811180," anyways,"
6811180,6812300," so,"
6812300,6814320," we're going to have some training data,"
6814320,6814720," right,"
6814720,6815000," so,"
6815000,6815900," for the XOR,"
6815900,6816520," right,"
6816520,6816980," so,"
6816980,6819580," I'm going to copy paste this stuff in here,"
6819580,6821160," okay,"
6821160,6822780," so,"
6822780,6824520," we're going to call it XOR train,"
6824520,6825320," and,"
6825320,6825840," here,"
6825840,6827000," zero is zero,"
6827000,6827680," one one,"
6827680,6828460," zero,"
6828460,6829200," there we go,"
6830100,6830920," cool,"
6830920,6830980," cool,"
6830980,6832500," so,"
6832500,6833000," and,"
6833000,6833600," I suppose,"
6833600,6834960," I'm going to,"
6834960,6838060," just copy paste this entire thing as well,"
6838060,6838440," right,"
6838440,6838600," so,"
6838600,6839940," this is going to be XOR train,"
6839940,6841080," we have four,"
6841080,6842780," four samples in the data,"
6842780,6843860," and,"
6843860,6844840," what's interesting is that,"
6844840,6845460," I suppose,"
6845460,6848680," the cost function is going to stay basically the same,"
6848680,6849620," except,"
6849620,6853180," instead of accepting the parameters of the neuron,"
6853180,6855580," we're going to accept the whole model in here,"
6856140,6857560," we're accepting the whole model,"
6857560,6858660," right,"
6858660,6859420," and instead of,"
6859420,6859600," like,"
6859600,6860960," calling this stuff directly,"
6860960,6861900," like,"
6861900,6864200," forwarding in place,"
6864200,6866000," we're going to just forward,"
6866000,6867520," forward,"
6867520,6870600," X1 and X2,"
6870600,6872820," with the model,"
6872820,6873900," along with the model,"
6873900,6877500," maybe we should have called them X1 and X2 in the forwarding as well,"
6877500,6877680," but,"
6877680,6877920," I mean,"
6877920,6879060," yeah,"
6879060,6881120," I think I want to call them X1 and X2,"
6881120,6882280," man,"
6882280,6883660," yeah,"
6883660,6884820," sorry,"
6886140,6888720," for the sake of consistency,"
6888720,6890160," for the sake of consistency,"
6890160,6891240," I'm going to call them like that,"
6891240,6891860," right,"
6891860,6892060," so,"
6892060,6893660," cost function is basically the same,"
6893660,6894080," is that,"
6894080,6895460," I abstracted the way,"
6895460,6897760," we forward data into the model,"
6897760,6898260," so now,"
6898260,6901920," as far as a cost function is concerned,"
6901920,6904900," the model can have whatever architecture you want,"
6904900,6905280," so,"
6905280,6908640," cost function doesn't know anything about the architecture of this,"
6908640,6909560," of this model,"
6909560,6909840," right,"
6909840,6910020," so,"
6910020,6910600," what it does,"
6910600,6912840," it just feeds two numbers into it,"
6912840,6915120," and it doesn't know how many neurons in there,"
6915120,6915960," it doesn't fucking know,"
6916000,6916500," it doesn't care,"
6916500,6917700," right,"
6917700,6919580," which is usually a bad thing,"
6919580,6921720," because the more assumptions you have about these things,"
6921720,6923660," the more optimal you can make it,"
6923660,6924040," right,"
6924040,6924300," so,"
6924300,6927180," especially if you're using like an actual gradient descent,"
6927180,6929060," an actual back propagation,"
6929060,6930120," you kind of,"
6930120,6930940," you know,"
6930940,6932840," unbox that black box,"
6932840,6933180," but,"
6933180,6933500," here,"
6933500,6935000," we're trying to keep this thing simple,"
6935000,6937160," just to show the essence of this entire approach,"
6937160,6938400," right,"
6938400,6938980," so,"
6938980,6939280," anyway,"
6939280,6940580," so,"
6940580,6943940," we probably want to have a random,"
6943940,6945420," random model,"
6945620,6945720," so,"
6945720,6947080," let's create some sort of a function,"
6947080,6948860," called randzor,"
6948860,6949400," right,"
6949400,6949660," so,"
6949660,6950740," this is a randzor,"
6950740,6952760," float,"
6952760,6954340," randzor,"
6954340,6956440," and it should be rather straightforward,"
6956440,6956920," right,"
6956920,6957300," so,"
6957300,6959820," just initialize all of these things,"
6959820,6961120," I'm going to remove this stuff,"
6961120,6962840," right,"
6962840,6965200," with random values,"
6965200,6965840," right,"
6965840,6967540," so,"
6967540,6969700," we're going to use a little bit of emacs magic,"
6969700,6970520," right,"
6970860,6971360," so,"
6971360,6971360," so,"
6971360,6971940," m,"
6971940,6973100," boom,"
6973100,6974260," equal,"
6974260,6974900," rand,"
6974900,6975660," float,"
6975660,6976380," boom,"
6976380,6977900," and just return m,"
6977900,6981020," and we probably want to create that m somewhere here,"
6981020,6981600," there we go,"
6981600,6983540," we've got random zor,"
6983540,6985720," get random zor,"
6986320,6991500," it would be nice to also be able to print the value of this model,"
6991500,6991720," right,"
6991720,6993560," because we want to be able to see what's inside,"
6993560,6996360," what are the weights and biases,"
6996360,6996820," right,"
6996820,6997000," so,"
6997000,6999160," let's do print zor,"
6999380,7000900," we're going to accept the model in here,"
7000900,7002320," all right,"
7002320,7003320," and I'm going to,"
7003320,7003880," again,"
7003880,7005480," copy paste all of that stuff in here,"
7005480,7006180," unfortunately,"
7006180,7007220," we're programming in C,"
7007220,7007960," right,"
7007960,7009080," in 2023,"
7009080,7013140," this is the stuff that the language supposed to generate for you,"
7013140,7017140," but C is kind of stuck in 70s,"
7017140,7017800," unfortunately,"
7017800,7018380," so,"
7018380,7019800," it is what it is,"
7019800,7021000," and it isn't what it isn't,"
7021000,7021540," is it not,"
7021540,7022500," I think it is,"
7022500,7023740," so,"
7023740,7023940," yeah,"
7023940,7024380," there we go,"
7024380,7025220," so,"
7025220,7026320," we created a random zor,"
7026320,7028340," and then I want to print that random zor,"
7028480,7029900," just to see what's inside of it,"
7029900,7030300," right,"
7030300,7030900," there we go,"
7030900,7033700," okay,"
7033700,7034180," so,"
7034180,7036440," we need to modify the build script,"
7036440,7039100," I'm going to add zor in here,"
7039100,7040820," okay,"
7040820,7041140," so,"
7041140,7041960," we rebuilt some stuff,"
7041960,7042160," so,"
7042160,7043580," let's go through the compilation errors,"
7043580,7044240," so,"
7044240,7044920," we need the math,"
7044920,7046260," what else do we need,"
7046260,7047420," so,"
7047420,7047800," it,"
7047800,7048800," okay,"
7048800,7050760," it doesn't have a random stuff,"
7050760,7051760," let's copy paste,"
7051760,7053460," rand float,"
7053460,7054520," all right,"
7054520,7054820," so,"
7054820,7055900," this is a rand float,"
7055900,7056780," let's put it in here,"
7056780,7057620," what else do you want,"
7057740,7058220," so,"
7058220,7061320," we're starting to have a lot of common things,"
7061320,7063360," maybe one of the things we want to do,"
7063360,7067760," we want to start extracting them to separate function,"
7067760,7068360," right,"
7068360,7069580," to separate function,"
7069580,7072560," oh,"
7072560,7075900," here's an interesting point,"
7075900,7076140," yeah,"
7076140,7077340," I think I heard that,"
7077340,7079940," I think I heard that,"
7079940,7082260," brain is a 90 billion neurons,"
7082260,7084540," and GPT 3.4 is actually very close,"
7084540,7086280," and GPT 4.4 is actually more,"
7086280,7087620," it's trillion,"
7087620,7088100," so,"
7088100,7090720," it's supposed to be more smart,"
7090720,7092380," than human,"
7092380,7093680," but here's an interesting thing,"
7093680,7095660," because neurons is actually,"
7095660,7097460," you can think of them as code,"
7097460,7098260," right,"
7099220,7099560," so,"
7099560,7101820," and as software developers,"
7101820,7103060," as professional,"
7103060,7105020," very experienced software developers,"
7105020,7106620," we know that more code,"
7106620,7108280," does not necessarily mean,"
7108280,7109360," more features,"
7109360,7110980," right,"
7110980,7112080," this is the first thing,"
7112080,7112380," right,"
7112380,7112980," so,"
7112980,7115180," it's how the things are connected,"
7115180,7116100," also very important,"
7116600,7117160," second thing,"
7117160,7119840," a single human neuron,"
7119840,7120260," neuron,"
7120260,7123080," is not equal to artificial neuron,"
7123080,7124060," actually,"
7124060,7125400," a single human neuron,"
7125400,7126600," is way smarter,"
7126600,7129500," is way more sophisticated,"
7129500,7130240," than just,"
7130240,7131760," a thing that sums up,"
7131760,7132420," its inputs,"
7132420,7133600," multiplies by weights,"
7133600,7134300," and biases,"
7134300,7134940," and just,"
7134940,7135460," you know,"
7135460,7136620," activates it,"
7136620,7137360," right,"
7137360,7138220," as far as I know,"
7138220,7140380," scientists were trying to,"
7140380,7141400," model,"
7141400,7143180," a single human neuron,"
7143180,7144560," with a separate,"
7144660,7146360," artificial neural network,"
7146360,7147580," that had like,"
7147580,7148900," million parameters,"
7148900,7151280," think about that,"
7151280,7152840," like a single human neuron,"
7152840,7154000," requires like,"
7154000,7154500," I don't know,"
7154500,7156200," like I don't want to lie on that,"
7156200,7157300," but you had to like,"
7157300,7158140," have the separate,"
7158140,7159680," artificial neural network,"
7159680,7160500," just to model,"
7160500,7161900," a single human neuron,"
7161900,7162800," was something like that,"
7162800,7164940," one human neuron,"
7164940,7165680," one million,"
7165680,7165980," yeah,"
7165980,7166660," so one million,"
7166660,7167440," around like that,"
7167440,7168260," so,"
7168260,7168900," it's like,"
7168900,7170520," it's not one to one comparison,"
7170520,7171000," actually,"
7171000,7172300," like one human neuron,"
7172300,7173340," is more powerful,"
7173340,7173980," than one,"
7173980,7174640," you know,"
7174660,7175620," computer neuron,"
7175620,7179000," so,"
7179000,7180140," yeah,"
7180140,7184480," humans,"
7184480,7185240," have,"
7185240,7186540," 500 million years,"
7186540,7187240," of pre-training,"
7187240,7187540," yeah,"
7187540,7188200," sort of,"
7188200,7188480," right,"
7188480,7189040," as far as I know,"
7189040,7191320," when the human body develops,"
7191320,7192300," like the brain,"
7192300,7193360," also configures,"
7193360,7194240," into like,"
7194240,7195000," very predefined,"
7195000,7196980," initial predefined structure,"
7196980,7197900," that also then,"
7197900,7198660," evolves over time,"
7198660,7200200," I don't know how it works,"
7200200,7200720," I don't want to,"
7200720,7201460," lie,"
7201460,7202480," or anything,"
7203920,7205520," so,"
7205520,7206460," also human neurons,"
7206460,7207640," are not fed forward,"
7207640,7208600," but also pulsed,"
7208600,7208820," yeah,"
7208820,7210040," that's an interesting observation,"
7210040,7210860," yeah,"
7210860,7213440," so it's not a one to one comparison,"
7213440,7214460," though,"
7214460,7215360," it also doesn't mean,"
7215360,7215980," that the,"
7215980,7217740," the artificial neural networks,"
7217740,7219340," may not outperform humans,"
7219340,7219820," right,"
7219820,7220700," so it's just like,"
7221760,7224080," what it means is that,"
7224080,7226000," they're kind of difficult to compare,"
7226000,7227360," okay,"
7227360,7227700," so,"
7227700,7229000," this is a random,"
7229000,7230240," so we have to return XOR,"
7230240,7231200," okay,"
7231200,7232380," so let's do,"
7232380,7233780," let's continue going through,"
7233780,7234600," the compilation errors,"
7234980,7235740," so,"
7235740,7236640," here,"
7236640,7238740," we're supposed to,"
7238740,7240620," get those things,"
7240620,7241900," from,"
7241900,7243720," the model,"
7243720,7245680," which is kind of hard,"
7245680,7246980," gotcha hyper,"
7246980,7247500," right,"
7247500,7248000," because,"
7248000,7250540," I have two component word in here,"
7250540,7251500," so it means,"
7251500,7252580," I have to jump once,"
7252580,7253320," twice,"
7253320,7254060," M dot,"
7254060,7254520," boom,"
7254520,7255220," there we go,"
7255220,7256920," can your beam do that,"
7258320,7258940," okay,"
7258940,7259740," that's cool,"
7259740,7260600," so what,"
7260600,7261340," what we've got,"
7261340,7262500," so I'm,"
7262500,7263420," I'm running this thing,"
7263420,7264380," so it's supposed to run XOR,"
7264380,7265360," there we go,"
7265360,7266860," this is the initial state,"
7266860,7267420," right,"
7267420,7267840," so,"
7267840,7269920," this is initial XOR model,"
7269920,7271340," and this is its initial state,"
7271340,7271620," right,"
7271620,7273400," so with all its weights,"
7273400,7273860," biases,"
7273860,7274740," and stuff like that,"
7274740,7275320," so,"
7275320,7276540," I called,"
7276540,7278400," I prefixed these things,"
7278400,7279280," with OR,"
7279280,7279840," NAND,"
7279840,7280580," and END,"
7280580,7281460," but again,"
7281460,7282420," this doesn't mean,"
7282420,7283580," that they're going to behave,"
7283580,7284800," like OR,"
7284800,7285920," like NAND,"
7285920,7286740," and END,"
7286740,7287340," so,"
7287340,7288220," this is more of a,"
7288280,7290400," like an outline,"
7290400,7292240," of what we expect,"
7292240,7294220," but it doesn't have to be this way,"
7294220,7294660," right,"
7294660,7295640," so it's just like,"
7295640,7297740," it's to make it easier for me,"
7297740,7298220," to remember,"
7298220,7298600," like,"
7298600,7299940," which neuron goes where,"
7299940,7303040," because this is how I think about XOR formula,"
7303040,7303780," right,"
7303780,7305080," wishful thinking,"
7305080,7305300," yeah,"
7305300,7306760," so this is wishful thinking,"
7306760,7308800," and as we observe soon,"
7308800,7310420," this is not how the neural network,"
7310420,7311960," will actually train all that,"
7311960,7312720," anyway,"
7312720,7313140," so,"
7313140,7315240," we need to know how well,"
7315240,7316460," this thing performs,"
7316460,7316740," right,"
7316740,7317600," so let's actually see,"
7318240,7319380," how well does it perform,"
7319380,7319760," right,"
7319760,7320540," so I'm going to do cost,"
7320540,7322500," equal F,"
7322500,7323260," cost,"
7323260,7323960," M,"
7323960,7324860," and there we go,"
7324860,7327580," okay,"
7327580,7328380," so,"
7328380,7328940," and,"
7328940,7329380," yeah,"
7329380,7330180," so here's the,"
7330180,7330780," here's the thing,"
7330780,7332180," and it doesn't really perform that well,"
7332180,7333400," right,"
7333400,7335240," so it's not even close to zero,"
7335240,7335740," right,"
7335820,7336160," okay,"
7336160,7340080," so we usually,"
7340080,7343000," how do we compute the finite differences,"
7343000,7344360," we wiggle around,"
7344360,7346040," all of the parameters,"
7346040,7348780," and then divide them by the,"
7348780,7349740," that wiggle,"
7349740,7350700," so,"
7350700,7351860," but we had three parameters,"
7351860,7353260," and it was easy to work with them,"
7353260,7354660," but now we have,"
7354660,7356080," nine parameters,"
7356080,7356920," so,"
7356920,7358460," there are going to be a lot of copy-paste,"
7358460,7359120," right,"
7359120,7359860," so,"
7359860,7360760," how can we do that,"
7360840,7361860," let's create a function,"
7361860,7363020," finite,"
7363020,7365440," finite difference,"
7365440,7366040," finite difference,"
7366040,7367080," so here,"
7367080,7368380," we're going to,"
7368380,7370160," provide the model,"
7370160,7370560," right,"
7370560,7371840," and,"
7371840,7373820," we're going to return a new model,"
7373820,7375640," which is going to store,"
7375640,7378740," the differences by which we have to modify this entire thing,"
7378740,7379920," so we accept the model,"
7379920,7380900," and here,"
7380900,7382220," we're going to get the gradient,"
7382220,7383420," by which we have to,"
7383420,7385580," in the direction of which we have to move,"
7385780,7386900," actually in the opposite direction,"
7386900,7387160," but,"
7387160,7388400," that's beside the point,"
7388400,7389980," okay,"
7389980,7391100," so,"
7391100,7392700," this one is going to be rather interesting,"
7392700,7393600," all right,"
7393600,7394640," because we have to,"
7394640,7396360," sort of,"
7396360,7399960," modify this thing,"
7399960,7401700," by the epsilon,"
7401700,7402300," right,"
7402300,7403420," we have to modify this thing,"
7403420,7404160," by the epsilon,"
7404160,7406080," compute its cost,"
7406080,7407740," compute its cost,"
7407740,7409260," all right,"
7409260,7410500," right,"
7410500,7412500," so we also need to have the original cost,"
7412500,7412840," right,"
7412840,7414220," so we need to have the original cost,"
7414360,7416200," cost m,"
7416200,7418500," so we wiggle the first parameter,"
7418500,7419200," by the epsilon,"
7419200,7420860," we get the new cost,"
7420860,7422900," subtract from the original cost,"
7422900,7425720," and divide it by the epsilon,"
7425720,7428280," and now we need to add it to the gradient,"
7428280,7429140," so we need to,"
7429140,7429960," sort of,"
7429960,7430200," like,"
7430200,7431960," have a separate model in here,"
7431960,7432940," so it's called g,"
7432940,7434500," right,"
7434500,7437140," and this one is going to be g or w1,"
7437140,7438320," right,"
7438320,7440260," and now we need to bring it back,"
7440260,7441340," right,"
7441340,7444040," so because we want to wiggle the rest of the elements,"
7444360,7445520," so essentially,"
7445520,7448140," we can just basically save"
7448140,7449340," the value,"
7449340,7452640," it would have been,"
7452640,7456580," it would have been easier if these parameters were array of floats,"
7456580,7457500," right,"
7457500,7458700," it would have been way easier,"
7458700,7460260," so I wouldn't have to do that,"
7460260,7462060," but for the sake of explicity,"
7462060,7463540," I'm, like,"
7463540,7464580," copy-pasting the code,"
7464580,7464940," right,"
7464940,7466000," so we're going to save"
7466000,7468440," the initial value of the model,"
7468840,7472300," we add this small wiggle to that thing,"
7472300,7473540," compute the new cost,"
7473540,7474740," find the difference,"
7474740,7475700," and then,"
7475700,7480280," we're going to restore the same thing,"
7480280,7481200," so I could have just,"
7481200,7481380," like,"
7481380,7483700," do something like minus epsilon,"
7483700,7486300," but we have to keep in mind that we're working with floats,"
7486300,7488960," adding and subtracting thing from floats,"
7488960,7490580," actually introduces error,"
7490580,7493500," and doing this thing like that accumulates the error,"
7493720,7494580," so to prevent the error,"
7494580,7495640," I'm actually saving,"
7495640,7495900," like,"
7495900,7498600," literally saving bit by bit original bits,"
7498600,7500440," and restoring the original bits,"
7500440,7501920," right,"
7501920,7504520," so that's why I just don't subtract epsilon,"
7504520,7506120," it would work in case of integers,"
7506120,7507240," but in case of floats,"
7507240,7508260," it's rather dangerous,"
7508260,7508620," because"
7508620,7511560," the plus and minus"
7511560,7513140," are in float"
7513140,7515080," in IEEE 754"
7515080,7516200," are really prone to"
7516200,7518540," accumulating errors,"
7518540,7518820," right,"
7518820,7521520," so multiplication doesn't really introduce that many errors,"
7521640,7523000," but plus minus actually,"
7523000,7525660," very fucky-buckish,"
7525660,7526940," anyway,"
7526940,7529200," so this is what we have to do per parameter,"
7529200,7530200," it's kind of dumb,"
7530200,7531400," I do understand that,"
7531400,7532660," please forgive me,"
7532660,7534420," but it is what it is,"
7534420,7535480," and it isn't what it isn't,"
7535480,7536040," is it not?"
7536040,7536940," I think it is,"
7536940,7537660," okay,"
7537660,7539540," so this is what we save,"
7539540,7541840," then we take the same parameter,"
7541840,7543660," add the epsilon,"
7543660,7544420," right,"
7544420,7548000," then we compute the gradient,"
7548000,7550440," so we take the cost of the modified model,"
7550680,7552360," subtract from the original cost,"
7552360,7553900," divide by the epsilon,"
7553900,7557580," and then we restore the saved thing,"
7557580,7558300," boom,"
7558300,7559280," there we go,"
7559280,7561340," can you do that,"
7561340,7562140," easy peasy,"
7562140,7563080," lemon squeezy,"
7563080,7564840," look at that beautiful,"
7564840,7566500," beautiful copy piece,"
7566500,7567900," oh,"
7567900,7568740," so,"
7568740,7570540," and then we return the gradient here,"
7570540,7571320," as you can see there,"
7571320,7571800," there we go,"
7571800,7574080," isn't that poggers,"
7574080,7575420," isn't that poggers,"
7575420,7575780," anyway,"
7577100,7577720," cool,"
7577720,7578620," so,"
7578620,7579980," let's see,"
7579980,7582740," so here we can actually print,"
7582740,7583260," or,"
7583260,7583860," what's it,"
7583860,7584380," print,"
7584380,7585320," yeah,"
7585320,7585860," it was print,"
7585860,7587000," print zorm,"
7587000,7588540," then,"
7588540,7592260," I'm going to separate this entire stuff,"
7592260,7593020," by the line,"
7593020,7594000," and then,"
7594000,7595120," I'm going to print,"
7595120,7597280," the finite difference,"
7597280,7598600," finite difference,"
7598600,7598980," here,"
7598980,7599560," there we go,"
7600220,7602200," so let's see the difference between them,"
7602200,7603920," okay,"
7603920,7604860," so it didn't work,"
7604860,7605980," because it wants epsilon,"
7605980,7608140," we can actually provide the epsilon here,"
7608140,7609160," why not,"
7609160,7611340," let's put it in here,"
7611340,7613880," float epsilon,"
7613880,7615780," let's say it's going to be like,"
7615780,7617300," one tenth,"
7617300,7618620," cool,"
7618620,7619980," so,"
7619980,7621180," essentially,"
7621180,7624120," this is the original random model,"
7624120,7627620," and this is the values,"
7628000,7631160," that we need to subtract from the original model,"
7631160,7634540," to drive it towards the local minimum of the cost function,"
7634540,7636580," does that make sense,"
7636580,7637660," does that make sense,"
7637660,7638660," so,"
7638660,7640360," that's basically what it is,"
7640360,7641980," right,"
7641980,7644460," again,"
7644460,7648060," this is not how we're supposed to do in a real case scenario,"
7648060,7649260," but it's going to work for us,"
7649260,7649680," right,"
7649680,7650740," it's going to work for us,"
7650740,7651580," cool,"
7652660,7653020," so,"
7653020,7654360," and let's repeat this entire process,"
7654360,7655720," so we take the finite difference,"
7655720,7656580," right,"
7656580,7657780," so,"
7657780,7659800," let me remove all of that,"
7659800,7662620," and that is basically the,"
7662620,7664740," our difference,"
7664740,7665460," our gradient,"
7665460,7668160," and now we need to take all of the parameters,"
7668160,7670060," and subtract them from M,"
7670060,7671460," right,"
7671460,7672540," so,"
7672540,7674340," we need a separate function to do that,"
7674340,7675440," with a lot of copy paste,"
7675440,7676240," right,"
7676600,7677780," so,"
7677780,7679180," let's say,"
7679180,7680820," apply difference,"
7680820,7681320," right,"
7681320,7683560," so here we're going to accept the original model,"
7683560,7686980," the thing that we got from the finite difference,"
7686980,7687760," and also,"
7687760,7690240," we'll also need the rate,"
7690240,7691080," the learning rate,"
7691080,7693760," we can actually call it something cool,"
7693760,7694900," let's call it"
7694900,7695880," train,"
7699880,7702940," so you can feel that we're doing something serious,"
7702940,7705900," you can feel that we're doing AI machine,"
7705900,7706160," well,"
7706160,7706700," okay,"
7706700,7708300," so people saying choo-choo,"
7708300,7710260," okay,"
7710260,7711340," this is not what I meant,"
7711340,7711640," right,"
7711640,7712480," people say choo-choo,"
7712480,7713300," so,"
7713300,7713560," okay,"
7713560,7715060," so it doesn't mean that it sounds cool,"
7715060,7715880," what could be,"
7715880,7717780," learn,"
7717780,7725020," the machine is learning,"
7725020,7726560," how about,"
7726560,7728240," is it a bonus,"
7728240,7729360," is it a compass,"
7729880,7730520," okay,"
7730520,7732060," so I think we've got some subs,"
7732060,7733160," oh yeah,"
7733160,7734740," we've got some subs that I didn't acknowledge,"
7734740,7735240," I'm really sorry,"
7735240,7736300," so,"
7736300,7737440," thank you so much,"
7737440,7738620," Venduza,"
7738620,7739260," for,"
7739260,7740340," for Twitch Prime,"
7740340,7740880," with the message,"
7740880,7743140," no regret watching such a cool instructor,"
7743140,7744520," thank you,"
7744520,7745200," thank you so much,"
7745200,7745960," honestly,"
7745960,7747740," I have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about,"
7747740,7750060," I'm not an AI person,"
7750060,7750960," at all,"
7750960,7753660," I literally know nothing about AI,"
7753660,7755920," I'm just screwing around,"
7755920,7756920," literally,"
7756920,7758240," right,"
7758240,7759700," I'm just taking the premise,"
7759880,7760800," of machine learning,"
7760800,7761980," which is basically,"
7761980,7762300," right,"
7762300,7763420," so you have a cost function,"
7763420,7764980," and you just screw around,"
7764980,7765480," with the model,"
7765480,7766640," until the cost function,"
7766640,7768600," is small enough,"
7768600,7769660," and you're good to go,"
7769660,7770480," right,"
7770480,7771520," so that's what I do,"
7771520,7772860," but I don't do that professionally,"
7772860,7773780," I don't know the details,"
7773780,7774860," or any tricks,"
7774860,7775760," and stuff like that,"
7775760,7776100," I'm just,"
7776560,7778120," playing with this idea,"
7778120,7778680," right,"
7778680,7780220," of this paradigm of programming,"
7780220,7780880," where you're not,"
7780880,7783780," where you're not code,"
7783780,7784960," the thing directly,"
7784960,7786740," but you code it indirectly,"
7786740,7787520," right,"
7787520,7788420," so,"
7788420,7789440," this is very interesting,"
7789440,7789960," in my opinion,"
7789960,7792140," junior frettus,"
7792140,7792760," thank you so much,"
7792760,7793600," for tier one subscription,"
7793600,7794440," and copper case,"
7794440,7795280," thank you so much,"
7795280,7796240," for tier one subscription,"
7796240,7796660," as well,"
7796660,7797020," thank you,"
7797020,7797280," thank you,"
7797280,7798140," thank you,"
7798140,7800200," all right,"
7800200,7800540," all right,"
7800540,7801800," we've got another sub,"
7801800,7802560," okay,"
7802560,7803480," thank you so much,"
7803480,7804660," sirinox,"
7804660,7805520," I hope I pronounced"
7805520,7806160," anything correctly,"
7806160,7806780," thank you so much,"
7806780,7807300," for the time,"
7807300,7808100," I appreciate that,"
7808100,7808420," anyway,"
7808420,7809660," okay,"
7809660,7810000," so,"
7810000,7810780," we're gonna do learn,"
7810780,7811300," right,"
7811300,7811780," and essentially,"
7811780,7812580," we just need to,"
7812580,7813880," do the usual thing,"
7813880,7814320," right,"
7814360,7815880," so,"
7815880,7816280," I suppose,"
7816280,7816800," if we're gonna,"
7816800,7818080," get serious,"
7818080,7819300," about all of that stuff,"
7819300,7820020," we will just like,"
7820020,7820840," make it an array,"
7820840,7821860," so it's easier,"
7821860,7822780," to do these things,"
7822780,7823800," right,"
7823800,7824240," but for now,"
7824240,7825540," we're not being super serious,"
7825540,7826200," about that stuff,"
7826200,7826460," so,"
7826460,7827620," who cares,"
7827620,7828380," we take m,"
7828380,7830560," and we're subtracting,"
7830560,7831780," the g,"
7831780,7832620," ah,"
7832620,7833180," god damn it,"
7833180,7833740," okay,"
7833740,7835320," the g,"
7835320,7836480," but again,"
7836480,7837600," we don't want to,"
7837600,7838460," subtract it right away,"
7838460,7839180," because it could be,"
7839180,7839900," too big,"
7839900,7840720," we want to multiply it,"
7840720,7841460," by some sort of,"
7841460,7842460," a certain rate,"
7842460,7842960," right,"
7842960,7844200," so it doesn't go too fast,"
7844360,7845540," and then,"
7845540,7846580," we can just return,"
7846580,7847840," the modified thing,"
7847840,7848980," so it's gonna be,"
7848980,7849580," this is gonna be,"
7849580,7850500," a pure function,"
7850500,7851840," right,"
7851840,7852540," since the,"
7852540,7853400," the entire model,"
7853400,7854200," is just a structure,"
7854200,7854980," this entire thing,"
7854980,7856060," can be a pure function,"
7856060,7859160," all right,"
7859160,7859620," so,"
7859620,7860300," okay,"
7860300,7861580," we can do,"
7861580,7862300," the following thing,"
7862300,7863540," I want to print,"
7863540,7864200," the,"
7864200,7866600," the cost of the function,"
7866600,7867200," before,"
7867200,7868020," we,"
7868020,7868900," basically,"
7868900,7869820," modified it,"
7869820,7870060," right,"
7870060,7871140," so this is gonna be,"
7871140,7872040," cost of m,"
7872040,7873420," then,"
7873660,7874280," I do,"
7874280,7875460," learn,"
7875460,7876840," all right,"
7876840,7877260," learn,"
7877260,7877680," m,"
7877680,7878120," g,"
7878120,7879420," I need to provide the rate,"
7879420,7879920," so,"
7879920,7881660," we know that the rate,"
7881660,7882740," of one tenth,"
7882740,7883800," is actually a good one,"
7883800,7885080," uh-huh,"
7885080,7886100," and then,"
7886100,7887800," I'm printing the cost again,"
7887800,7889020," just to make sure,"
7889020,7891040," that it actually drives it down,"
7891040,7891620," right,"
7891620,7892800," uh,"
7892800,7893180," right,"
7893180,7894180," so I just want to make sure,"
7894180,7895220," that it drives it down,"
7895220,7897120," and let's put a semicolon here,"
7897120,7897840," uh,"
7897840,7898100," does it,"
7898100,7898580," okay,"
7898840,7899500," so as you can see,"
7899500,7900180," it became smaller,"
7900180,7902060," we can work with that,"
7902060,7903300," we can optimize it,"
7903300,7903820," right,"
7903820,7904660," so,"
7904660,7905540," that's cool,"
7905540,7907560," so this is the cost,"
7907560,7908400," uh,"
7908400,7909260," we're gonna be printing it,"
7909260,7910740," uh,"
7910740,7911560," let's actually print it,"
7911560,7913160," after we modify this entire thing,"
7913160,7914660," and let's do that several times,"
7914660,7915440," right,"
7915440,7919520," let's do that several times,"
7919520,7920860," boom,"
7921540,7922140," okay,"
7922140,7923760," so how about ten,"
7923760,7927580," cool,"
7927580,7929340," so it's going down,"
7929340,7930440," nice,"
7930440,7932100," thousand of times,"
7932100,7932680," uh,"
7932680,7934680," I'm not going to run this entire thing,"
7934680,7935220," right,"
7935220,7936180," I'm gonna only compile,"
7936180,7937780," and we're gonna try to run it from,"
7937780,7938660," from here,"
7938660,7940720," it's actually went below 25,"
7940720,7942120," remember,"
7942120,7942860," I think,"
7942860,7944480," when we were trying to do that,"
7944480,7944900," we,"
7944900,7945480," like,"
7945480,7947200," with a simpler neural network,"
7947200,7950020," it was not able to go below 25,"
7950020,7950660," I think,"
7950920,7952520," I think it was not able to do that,"
7952520,7953180," uh,"
7953180,7953520," right,"
7953520,7955220," so let me find the train,"
7955220,7955960," right,"
7955960,7956380," so,"
7956380,7956740," uh,"
7956740,7957540," do we have Zor,"
7957540,7958680," right,"
7958680,7959760," so let's introduce Zor,"
7959760,7961040," so,"
7961040,7962400," this one is going to be zero,"
7962400,7962960," zero,"
7962960,7965040," Zor train,"
7965040,7966760," Zor,"
7966760,7967800," uh,"
7967800,7968740," let me try to recompile,"
7968740,7970320," and if I do,"
7970320,7971140," git,"
7971140,7972900," uh-huh,"
7972900,7975220," it doesn't,"
7975220,7977280," uh,"
7977280,7978700," trace anything,"
7980300,7981860," yeah,"
7981860,7983180," it stayed at 25,"
7983180,7983900," right,"
7983900,7985000," so no matter what you do,"
7985000,7985480," it doesn't,"
7985480,7986660," it stays at 25,"
7986660,7987540," it doesn't go below,"
7987540,7988440," right,"
7988440,7989340," uh,"
7989340,7990040," it cannot do that,"
7990040,7990220," like,"
7990220,7991500," it doesn't have enough parameters,"
7991500,7992280," and stuff like that,"
7992280,7993360," but if we do Zor,"
7993360,7994280," uh,"
7994280,7995900," it's already lower than 25,"
7995900,7997740," and it's only a thousand of times,"
7997740,7998160," right,"
7998160,7999780," what if we give it more time to,"
7999780,8000480," to train,"
8000480,8000880," and,"
8000880,8001160," like,"
8001160,8001920," learn something,"
8001920,8002900," uh,"
8002900,8003140," right,"
8003140,8003680," so what about,"
8003680,8004480," uh,"
8004480,8006280," 10,000 prices,"
8006280,8013620," look at how,"
8013620,8013940," it's,"
8013940,8014120," like,"
8014120,8015360," way below 25,"
8015360,8016740," it's way,"
8016740,8016980," like,"
8016980,8017220," it's,"
8017220,8019180," it's actually doing something interesting,"
8019180,8020000," because it's more,"
8020000,8021700," it has a more complicated architecture,"
8021700,8023260," what the fuck,"
8023260,8023700," okay,"
8023700,8024820," so what if we give it,"
8024820,8025420," maybe,"
8025420,8026160," I don't know,"
8026160,8027400," half of a million,"
8027400,8028600," what about half of a million,"
8029460,8031440," it's not bad,"
8031440,8031880," but I mean,"
8031880,8032540," uh,"
8032540,8033320," what about a million,"
8033320,8034060," so am I,"
8034060,8034820," oh,"
8034820,8039040," it's going to be modifying the wrong product,"
8039040,8040100," right,"
8040100,8040420," so,"
8040420,8041500," what about 100,"
8041500,8042320," uh,"
8042320,8042780," right,"
8042780,8044920," it was a wrong program,"
8044920,8045200," sorry,"
8045200,8046160," uh,"
8046160,8047320," yo,"
8047320,8047960," what the fuck,"
8047960,8049560," it's actually very good cost,"
8049560,8050000," look at,"
8050000,8051640," it's almost zero,"
8051640,8051880," it's,"
8051880,8053400," it actually performs what we want,"
8053400,8055820," the fuck,"
8055820,8058260," all right,"
8058260,8058760," so,"
8058900,8060840," let's actually see how well it performs,"
8060840,8061120," right,"
8061120,8062120," let's see how well it performs,"
8062120,8063300," we're going to do the usual trick,"
8063300,8064160," uh,"
8064160,8064640," zero,"
8064640,8065180," two,"
8065180,8066000," plus i,"
8066000,8067240," uh,"
8067240,8073600," so,"
8073600,8074360," and then,"
8074360,8075120," uh,"
8075120,8076820," let's print z u,"
8076820,8078560," z u,"
8078560,8079560," and f,"
8079560,8080260," right,"
8080260,8081300," so essentially i,"
8081300,8081760," j,"
8081760,8083980," and we forward the final model,"
8083980,8084380," right,"
8084380,8085420," we forward the final model,"
8085420,8086240," uh,"
8086240,8086580," m,"
8086580,8087060," i,"
8087060,8087420," j,"
8087420,8088180," right,"
8088240,8089220," so since it accepts floats,"
8089220,8091420," it will cast the size t to float,"
8091420,8092520," we don't have to worry about it,"
8092520,8094120," and so here we can put,"
8094120,8094800," uh,"
8094800,8095340," the line,"
8095340,8096620," we can put the line here,"
8096620,8097580," right,"
8097580,8098120," and,"
8098120,8098480," uh,"
8098480,8099480," let's see what's going to happen,"
8099480,8100500," so,"
8100500,8102620," okay,"
8102620,8103580," it's going somewhere,"
8103580,8106160," below five,"
8106160,8107160," below half,"
8107160,8108360," above half,"
8108360,8109080," above half,"
8109080,8109320," below,"
8109320,8111260," zord,"
8111260,8112280," mother flipper,"
8112280,8113780," mother flipper,"
8113780,8114380," zord,"
8114380,8115240," you know,"
8115240,8116120," what's cool,"
8116120,8118500," about that specific neural network,"
8118500,8120300," uh,"
8120300,8120660," right,"
8120660,8121040," you know,"
8121040,8122700," what's cool about that specific neural network,"
8122700,8124420," it works,"
8124420,8125840," not only with xor,"
8125840,8127300," so the,"
8127300,8129260," the neural network with one neuron,"
8129260,8130380," can only do,"
8130380,8131100," or,"
8131100,8131620," and,"
8131620,8132640," and nand,"
8132640,8133340," uh,"
8133340,8133680," this,"
8133680,8134800," but it cannot do xor,"
8134800,8136280," this one can do xor,"
8136280,8137920," and everything before,"
8137920,8139340," it can also do or,"
8139340,8140720," it can also do and,"
8140720,8141820," we can actually check that,"
8141820,8142320," right,"
8142320,8142680," so,"
8142680,8144980," we just add more parameters,"
8144980,8146860," we make it a little bit more complicated,"
8146860,8147560," and now it,"
8147560,8149520," it can accommodate more gates,"
8149520,8150460," right,"
8150460,8151080," so,"
8151080,8153260," it can become any of those,"
8153260,8155280," let's actually copy paste all of that data in here,"
8155280,8155600," right,"
8155600,8155780," and,"
8155780,8156520," and test that,"
8156520,8157440," uh,"
8157440,8157800," right,"
8157800,8158200," so,"
8158200,8160500," so where is the training data,"
8160500,8160800," right,"
8160800,8161940," so this is a xor train,"
8161940,8163020," uh,"
8163020,8163480," right,"
8163480,8164400," so let's see,"
8164400,8165780," if I put or in here,"
8165780,8166240," right,"
8166240,8168140," if I put or in here and recompile it,"
8168140,8168760," uh,"
8168760,8169680," will it become or?"
8170720,8171200," actually,"
8171200,8172740," it becomes or way easily,"
8172740,8173220," so,"
8173220,8173700," yeah,"
8173700,8174380," it becomes or,"
8174380,8175440," 0,"
8175440,8176000," 1,"
8176000,8176360," 1,"
8176360,8176720," 1,"
8176720,8177380," right,"
8177380,8177660," 0,"
8177660,8177860," 1,"
8177860,8178060," 1,"
8178060,8178060," 1,"
8178060,8178260," 1,"
8178260,8179880," then what about end,"
8179880,8180840," can it become end?"
8180840,8184120," Let's train it a little bit,"
8184120,8189140," it's 0,"
8189140,8189480," 0,"
8189480,8189880," 0,"
8189880,8190460," 1,"
8190460,8191560," it can become end,"
8191560,8192700," uh,"
8192700,8193180," and,"
8193180,8193660," uh,"
8193660,8194040," nand,"
8194040,8196100," right,"
8196100,8196500," we're,"
8196500,8198600," we're using the same architecture in here,"
8198600,8200440," we're literally using the same architecture,"
8200560,8202100," just more than one neuron,"
8202100,8204300," and it can still act like all of these elements,"
8204300,8205300," uh,"
8205300,8206540," so nand has to be 1,"
8206540,8206740," 1,"
8206740,8206980," 1,"
8206980,8207280," 0,"
8207280,8208460," uh,"
8208460,8208680," yeah,"
8208680,8209120," 1,"
8209120,8209360," 1,"
8209360,8209600," 1,"
8209600,8209660," 1,"
8209660,8210000," 0,"
8210000,8211360," that's pretty cool,"
8211360,8212520," but on top of that,"
8212520,8213580," it can also do xor,"
8213580,8215860," uh,"
8215860,8218000," so it's just like more powerful,"
8218000,8219440," it can become more things,"
8219440,8221000," uh,"
8221000,8222060," it's more flexible,"
8222060,8223520," nor,"
8223520,8224100," uh,"
8224100,8224600," this one,"
8224600,8225340," yeah,"
8225440,8227060," so it accepts two parameters,"
8227060,8227500," right,"
8227500,8228600," so it accepts two parameters,"
8228600,8231120," so we need probably the one that accepts one parameter,"
8231120,8232620," but we can try to make it,"
8232620,8234900," maybe ignore the second one or something like that,"
8234900,8236180," but I don't want to go into that,"
8236180,8239400," so one of the things I wanted to actually check,"
8239400,8239880," right,"
8239880,8243320," so here we allocated three neurons,"
8243320,8244600," hoping that,"
8244600,8245380," uh,"
8245460,8248440," they will roughly correspond to or,"
8248440,8249080," nand,"
8249080,8249980," and end,"
8249980,8251860," because that's how you can express,"
8251860,8254060," that's how you can express,"
8254060,8254420," nor,"
8254420,8254720," ah,"
8254720,8255000," nor,"
8255000,8255520," I see,"
8255520,8256600," let's try nor,"
8256600,8260020," and for some reason my brain interpreted nor as not,"
8260020,8261040," yeah,"
8261040,8261460," I'm sorry,"
8261460,8262380," okay,"
8262380,8263600," uh,"
8263600,8264120," nand,"
8264120,8265240," let's actually code,"
8265240,8265740," uh,"
8265740,8266640," the data for,"
8266640,8267820," for nor,"
8267820,8269760," nand,"
8269760,8271940," okay,"
8271940,8273700," so nor,"
8274120,8274560," uh,"
8274560,8275840," and it's essentially"
8275840,8277180," one,"
8277180,8277600," one,"
8277600,8277920," one,"
8277920,8278920," one,"
8278920,8279300," one,"
8279300,8279780," zero,"
8279780,8280280," zero,"
8280280,8280920," zero,"
8280920,8281480," right,"
8281480,8283680," so let's put nor in here,"
8283680,8285020," I'm pretty sure it will get to do that,"
8285020,8285940," but I don't know,"
8285940,8287200," maybe there is a trick in here,"
8287200,8289340," it goes well,"
8289340,8291240," uh,"
8291240,8292300," looks like nor to me,"
8292300,8293420," so it can,"
8293420,8294300," can handle all of them,"
8294300,8299520," so essentially this particular neural network can act like any gate,"
8299520,8300100," right,"
8300100,8300620," basically,"
8300620,8301240," I think,"
8301240,8301720," right,"
8301720,8304100," so whatever you train it to,"
8304100,8304340," to be,"
8304340,8305900," it will act like that thing,"
8305900,8306800," uh,"
8306800,8307240," right,"
8307240,8309680," so depending on the configuration of these things,"
8309680,8310860," uh,"
8310860,8311120," okay,"
8311120,8312080," but here is another thing,"
8312080,8312600," it's a thing,"
8312600,8313820," let's actually train ZOR,"
8313820,8314260," right,"
8314260,8315160," let's train ZOR,"
8315160,8316380," as I already said,"
8316380,8316780," these,"
8316780,8318680," these things are not necessarily what they're going to be,"
8318680,8319600," uh,"
8319600,8323660," this is just sort of like a justification for the architecture of this neural network,"
8323660,8328660," let's explore how exactly those things actually behave,"
8328660,8331540," let's actually isolate these individual neural,"
8331660,8332120," neurons,"
8332120,8334280," and do the truth table on them,"
8334280,8336600," and see what is their truth table,"
8336600,8338480," isn't that interesting,"
8338480,8339260," so now,"
8339260,8341960," we were treating this thing as a black box,"
8341960,8342240," right,"
8342240,8343980," so this is a black box with three neurons,"
8343980,8345480," we don't really know what they correspond to,"
8345480,8347420," let's try to dissect this thing,"
8347540,8348620," and see how it behaves,"
8348620,8350520," does it really behaves like OR,"
8350520,8351000," NAND,"
8351000,8351600," and END,"
8351600,8353100," probably not,"
8353100,8353860," we'll see,"
8353860,8354160," we'll see,"
8354160,8355000," let's actually find out,"
8355000,8356240," because it's very interesting,"
8356240,8356760," right,"
8356760,8358880," so we're doing robot surgery,"
8358880,8359220," yeah,"
8359220,8359660," exactly,"
8359660,8361100," how can we do that,"
8361100,8361840," uh,"
8361840,8364180," we can just like forward this thing directly,"
8364180,8364660," right,"
8364660,8366920," we can forward this thing directly by using this formula,"
8366920,8367200," right,"
8367200,8369240," we can bypass this forward function,"
8369240,8370620," uh,"
8370620,8370920," okay,"
8370920,8371600," so,"
8371600,8373520," let's just do that,"
8373520,8374520," uh,"
8374520,8375680," maybe we want to actually,"
8375680,8377840," separate this thing like so,"
8377840,8378380," right,"
8378380,8379840," so we're separating this thing like so,"
8379840,8380980," uh,"
8380980,8381360," okay,"
8381360,8382400," so,"
8382400,8383700," here is OR,"
8383700,8385520," so the input is going to be I,"
8385520,8386680," J,"
8386680,8387940," uh,"
8387940,8388300," OR,"
8388300,8389020," okay,"
8389020,8390620," mm-mm,"
8390620,8391920," so let's see,"
8391920,8393520," um,"
8393520,8396420," so maybe it would also make sense to maybe print,"
8396420,8397020," uh,"
8397020,8398140," this thing like this,"
8398140,8399200," uh,"
8399200,8400080," OR,"
8400620,8401660," uh,"
8401660,8402940," neuron,"
8402940,8404880," and I put it in quotation marks because,"
8404880,8405200," uh,"
8405200,8405760," Mars,"
8405760,8408620," because it doesn't necessarily have to be the OR,"
8408620,8409060," right,"
8409060,8410620," so I'm sort of like emphasizing that,"
8410620,8411820," uh,"
8411820,8413220," and let's do ZU,"
8413220,8414060," uh,"
8414060,8414400," OR,"
8414400,8415280," ZU,"
8415280,8416660," equal F,"
8416660,8417960," uh,"
8417960,8418440," right,"
8418440,8419680," and let's do I,"
8419680,8420100," J,"
8420100,8424240," and let's see how it is going to behave,"
8424240,8425940," uh,"
8425940,8426160," right,"
8426160,8430600," so maybe I'm going to get rid of the tracing to speed up the train,"
8430600,8431160," right,"
8431160,8432320," uh,"
8432320,8433480," to speed up the train,"
8433480,8434760," and let's go,"
8434760,8435620," okay,"
8435620,8438460," surprisingly,"
8438460,8441860," this one acts,"
8441860,8443820," so zero,"
8443820,8445940," this one acts like end,"
8445940,8447760," yeah,"
8447760,8448400," this is end,"
8449680,8450540," that's funny,"
8450540,8450540," that's funny,"
8450540,8452660," so the OR,"
8452660,8454420," found it,"
8454420,8458500," basically the learning process found a conversion where the OR became an end,"
8458500,8461540," and what's interesting is that OR is on the first,"
8461540,8462340," uh,"
8462340,8462740," layer,"
8463160,8465100," so end was supposed to be here,"
8465100,8466140," but it actually put it in here,"
8466140,8467680," so it found a different formula,"
8467680,8468900," right,"
8468900,8469180," it's,"
8469180,8470140," it's kind of end-ish,"
8470140,8470440," right,"
8470440,8471560," so it's kind of end-ish,"
8471560,8472340," uh,"
8472340,8474820," so what's funny is that it's supposed to be different every time,"
8474820,8475820," uh,"
8475880,8476080," right,"
8476080,8476580," well,"
8476580,8479900," we're not randomizing properly,"
8479900,8480160," okay,"
8480160,8480960," so srand,"
8480960,8482300," uh,"
8482300,8484120," srand is going to be time zero,"
8484120,8488660," and also I want to print the last cost function,"
8488660,8489220," just to,"
8489220,8492960," just to make sure that we didn't hit a really weird place in a,"
8492960,8497020," in a cost function domain that there is no proper minimum or something like that,"
8497020,8498580," I just want to make sure that that's the,"
8498580,8500000," that's the right cost function,"
8500000,8503040," because you never know what you're going to hit in there,"
8503040,8505280," so let me see,"
8505280,8507540," uh,"
8507540,8507740," okay,"
8507740,8510500," so the cost function is good enough,"
8510500,8511420," uh,"
8511420,8511680," right,"
8511680,8513700," and it's still kind of end-ish,"
8513700,8517560," and did I not,"
8517560,8521840," am I modifying a wrong place again,"
8521840,8527160," it did change,"
8527160,8527560," oh,"
8527560,8527820," okay,"
8527820,8528600," oh,"
8528600,8528860," okay,"
8528860,8529720," oh,"
8529720,8530160," oh,"
8530160,8530400," okay,"
8530400,8530920," so I'm,"
8530920,8531840," I'm looking at the wrong thing,"
8531840,8532060," okay,"
8532060,8532440," I'm sorry,"
8532440,8534400," so this one acts now like,"
8534400,8534760," like,"
8534760,8535060," or,"
8535060,8536020," this one,"
8536020,8537140," this time it works like,"
8537140,8537440," or,"
8537440,8538020," yeah,"
8538020,8540300," so I was looking at here somewhere or something,"
8540300,8541020," yeah,"
8541020,8543300," yeah,"
8543300,8549140," sometimes it acts like,"
8549140,8551820," it acts differently from time to time,"
8551840,8552760," right,"
8552760,8554280," it acts differently from time to time,"
8554280,8555300," so,"
8555300,8555800," uh,"
8555800,8556120," all right,"
8556120,8557000," let's take a look at the,"
8557000,8557320," uh,"
8557320,8558060," the rest of the things,"
8558060,8558320," right,"
8558320,8560620," so the next one is going to be NAND,"
8560620,8561680," uh,"
8561680,8562100," right,"
8562100,8562800," and NAND,"
8562800,8564300," let's define it like so,"
8564300,8567260," so this is NAND,"
8567260,8568420," uh,"
8568420,8571900," and I'm going to replace this thing with NAND in here,"
8571900,8573400," and let's see what's going to happen,"
8573400,8575380," uh,"
8575380,8576960," maybe I want to do something like Team Ux,"
8576960,8578640," so it's a little bit easier for me,"
8578640,8579460," uh,"
8579460,8579740," right,"
8579740,8580760," okay,"
8581480,8581760," uh,"
8581760,8582300," this,"
8582300,8583800," NAND-ish,"
8583800,8584680," more or less,"
8584680,8586020," is this NAND?"
8586020,8588600," This is actually NAND,"
8588600,8590180," it does act like an NAND,"
8590180,8591620," right,"
8591620,8593300," this one does act like an NAND,"
8593300,8594800," I think,"
8594800,8597140," no,"
8597140,8597600," not really,"
8597600,8598020," actually,"
8598020,8598440," this one,"
8598440,8599780," this is NOR,"
8599780,8601420," what the,"
8601420,8601660," yeah,"
8601660,8602300," this is NOR,"
8602300,8606540," oh,"
8606540,8607220," it's even OR,"
8607220,8607620," oh my god,"
8607620,8608620," I'm already tired,"
8608620,8609040," I'm sorry,"
8609040,8609320," yeah,"
8609320,8609620," yeah,"
8609620,8609840," so,"
8609840,8612500," that's cool,"
8612500,8613120," so it,"
8613120,8614260," it finds different,"
8614260,8614520," like,"
8614520,8615780," configurations every time,"
8615780,8616060," right,"
8616060,8616700," so,"
8616700,8618180," and let's take a look at the last one,"
8618180,8619580," let's take a look at the last one,"
8619680,8621240," so the last one has to be END,"
8621240,8622300," uh,"
8622300,8623960," the output one,"
8623960,8625240," uh,"
8625240,8626820," so END,"
8626820,8629500," just the regular END,"
8629500,8630740," um,"
8630740,8631400," END,"
8632840,8640000," okay,"
8640000,8644020," I forgot to remove the parent,"
8644020,8644820," the parent,"
8644820,8645600," the close parent,"
8645600,8646820," but in any case,"
8646820,8647660," this one is,"
8647660,8649560," this one is weird even,"
8649560,8649820," like,"
8649820,8650800," what the fuck is this,"
8650800,8652300," it's just like,"
8652300,8653360," 01 is 1,"
8653360,8654620," but 10 is 0,"
8654620,8655700," so,"
8655700,8656400," it just like,"
8656400,8658200," came up with the random thing,"
8658200,8660100," but what's cool about this random thing,"
8660100,8661180," at the end,"
8661180,8662500," combined together,"
8662740,8664440," they still act like XOR,"
8664440,8665820," so,"
8665820,8669180," we're just letting the neural network to do whatever,"
8669180,8672120," some of these things may not be even proper,"
8672120,8672480," like,"
8672480,8673460," binary gates,"
8673460,8673980," right,"
8673980,8677240," so maybe some of them work out purely because they're continuous,"
8677240,8678480," right,"
8678480,8680860," so that's what's cool about this entire thing,"
8680860,8681180," so,"
8681180,8681860," it's just like,"
8681860,8682040," it,"
8682040,8683400," it can do whatever,"
8683400,8683960," right,"
8683960,8686360," it can have some weird intermediate states,"
8686360,8688060," some of them are not even real,"
8688060,8689160," but overall,"
8689160,8691040," overall,"
8691040,8692320," it acts like XOR,"
8692640,8694740," and every time it builds a different configuration,"
8694740,8695680," so,"
8695680,8697540," what if we,"
8697540,8699400," another interesting question,"
8699400,8702020," what if we give it just more neurons,"
8702020,8702500," like,"
8702500,8703480," even more neurons,"
8703480,8704260," and,"
8704260,8707260," will it come up with more complicated circuits,"
8707260,8707920," like,"
8707920,8708440," for example,"
8708440,8709040," adder,"
8709040,8710340," what if I,"
8710340,8710680," okay,"
8710680,8712100," so,"
8712100,8712420," let me,"
8712420,8713180," let me try to draw,"
8713800,8714000," so,"
8714000,8716440," another interesting thing to try out,"
8716440,8718700," to bump up the amount of,"
8718700,8719500," you know,"
8719500,8720420," parameters would be,"
8720420,8722920," take four inputs,"
8722920,8723580," right,"
8723580,8723800," so,"
8723800,8724840," this is going to be four inputs,"
8724840,8726480," and this is your first number,"
8726480,8727260," right,"
8727260,8728020," then,"
8728020,8729660," take another four of them,"
8729660,8730760," right,"
8730760,8731700," another four of them,"
8732440,8735560," and basically allocate,"
8735560,8735980," like,"
8735980,8737880," some amount of neurons,"
8737880,8739740," and just connect all of these things,"
8739740,8741540," to,"
8741540,8742040," like,"
8742040,8743240," these hidden layers,"
8743240,8743820," like,"
8743820,8745340," to all of these hidden layers,"
8745340,8746540," like so,"
8747540,8749000," and as an output,"
8749000,8752040," have four neurons as an output,"
8752040,8753240," right,"
8753240,8755340," and train it,"
8755340,8757200," to add together,"
8757200,8759040," these two numbers,"
8759040,8759480," like,"
8759480,8761040," take the bits of this number,"
8761040,8762420," the bits of this number,"
8762420,8763480," and add them together,"
8763480,8764400," and have it to be,"
8764400,8765480," the thing,"
8765480,8768540," will it come up with an actual circuit,"
8768540,8769780," over summer,"
8769780,8771760," to do that?"
8771760,8775960," That would have been interesting,"
8775960,8776540," actually,"
8777540,8777940," right,"
8777940,8778900," you know what I mean,"
8778900,8779100," like,"
8779100,8781320," we can even try to estimate,"
8781320,8782380," how many neurons,"
8782380,8783820," you need to have,"
8783820,8785500," and how deep the neural network,"
8785500,8786180," has to be,"
8786180,8787560," to sort of create,"
8787560,8788300," such circuits,"
8788300,8789540," right,"
8789540,8792420," and that's very interesting,"
8792420,8794680," that's very interesting project,"
8794680,8795340," to actually,"
8795340,8797160," try to tackle,"
8797160,8798000," but we're going to do that,"
8798000,8798780," next time,"
8798780,8799720," we're going to do that,"
8799720,8800120," next time,"
8800120,8800900," because I'm already streaming,"
8800900,8802260," for almost three hours,"
8802260,8803620," so this is going to be,"
8803620,8804580," for the next stream,"
8804580,8805960," and this is actually,"
8805960,8807400," very cool paradigm,"
8807540,8808000," you see,"
8808000,8809600," so it starts up,"
8809600,8810060," like,"
8810060,8810660," if you start,"
8810660,8810840," like,"
8810840,8811880," exploring this entire thing,"
8811880,8813420," as something boring,"
8813420,8813880," like,"
8813880,8815120," remember what we started with,"
8815120,8816280," we started with,"
8816280,8817500," this stupid shit,"
8817500,8818180," like,"
8818180,8818780," look at that,"
8818780,8820360," this is what we started with,"
8820360,8821040," right,"
8821460,8822500," what's interesting,"
8822500,8822520," what's interesting,"
8822520,8823720," about a simple,"
8823720,8824920," linear formula,"
8824920,8826780," but as you start,"
8826780,8828080," to explore this idea,"
8828080,8829320," of just like,"
8829320,8831260," having this cost function,"
8831260,8832420," and this model,"
8832420,8833760," and tweaking the parameter,"
8833760,8834740," until the cost function,"
8834740,8835380," becomes zero,"
8835380,8837380," and then you bump up,"
8837380,8838260," the amount of parameters,"
8838260,8839020," you can come up with,"
8839020,8840060," more and more interesting,"
8840060,8840960," things to tackle,"
8840960,8841900," and it becomes,"
8841900,8843220," more and more interesting,"
8843220,8844440," so what's going to be the next,"
8844860,8845940," some time ago,"
8845940,8847260," actually,"
8847260,8849740," I think I did a project,"
8849740,8851540," on the first ever,"
8851540,8852800," Perceptron,"
8852800,8853700," do you guys remember,"
8853700,8854200," yeah,"
8854200,8854520," so,"
8854520,8856500," I wonder if I can find it,"
8856500,8858680," I wonder if I can find it,"
8858680,8860320," Perceptron,"
8860320,8861200," yeah,"
8861200,8862160," so,"
8862160,8863740," it's a project,"
8863740,8865200," that is inspired,"
8865200,8867020," by Veritasium video,"
8867020,8869140," on the first ever Perceptron,"
8869140,8869400," yeah,"
8869400,8870320," so here's the thing,"
8870320,8871840," the point of the Perceptron,"
8871840,8872540," was to,"
8872540,8874020," detect,"
8874860,8875960," whether,"
8875960,8878580," whatever is drawing,"
8878580,8879240," on the screen,"
8879240,8880320," is a circle,"
8880320,8882020," or a square,"
8882020,8883020," and what's,"
8883020,8884120," how it is done,"
8884120,8885360," is basically,"
8885360,8886000," by creating,"
8886000,8887460," a two-dimensional layer,"
8887460,8889320," of neurons,"
8889320,8890080," right,"
8890080,8890720," which basically,"
8890720,8891700," sum everything up,"
8891700,8892660," with certain weights,"
8892660,8894120," and classifying this thing,"
8894120,8894820," whether it's a,"
8894820,8896520," circle or rectangle,"
8896520,8897660," and it's trained,"
8897660,8899200," by a very weird,"
8899200,8900560," process,"
8900560,8901000," where,"
8901000,8901980," if it's,"
8901980,8903780," wrongly classified something,"
8903780,8904460," we subtract,"
8904760,8905720," a circle from the weights,"
8905720,8906480," or something like that,"
8906480,8906920," it like,"
8906920,8907900," never really trained,"
8907900,8908620," anything useful,"
8908620,8909880," it's a really flawed way,"
8909880,8911620," of training this entire thing,"
8911620,8912340," and,"
8912340,8914080," the cool thing,"
8914080,8915300," about this specific example,"
8915300,8915780," is that,"
8915780,8916660," you don't need,"
8916660,8918880," a lot of human generated data,"
8918880,8920040," to train this thing,"
8920040,8921000," you can generate,"
8921000,8921820," all the data,"
8921820,8923000," procedurally,"
8923000,8923920," right,"
8923920,8924840," you can generate,"
8924840,8925640," all the data procedure,"
8925640,8926160," by the way,"
8926160,8927160," whatever you see,"
8927160,8927680," on the screen,"
8927680,8928340," is basically,"
8928340,8929300," the change,"
8929300,8930280," of the weights,"
8930280,8931000," as,"
8931000,8932800," during the learning process,"
8932800,8933560," but the learning process,"
8933560,8934020," is actually,"
8934020,8934580," really weird,"
8934580,8935120," and flawed,"
8935120,8936340," it doesn't really go anywhere,"
8936340,8937740," so what I was thinking,"
8937740,8939700," we can take this,"
8939700,8941740," as even bigger project,"
8941740,8942240," to tackle,"
8942240,8943180," can we build,"
8943180,8944540," a similar neural network,"
8944540,8945560," that classifies,"
8945560,8946820," whatever image,"
8946820,8947240," it sees,"
8947240,8947980," as a circle,"
8947980,8949000," or a rectangle,"
8949000,8949840," the cool thing,"
8949840,8950720," about this specific,"
8950720,8952440," example again,"
8952440,8952780," is that,"
8952780,8953580," because we don't need,"
8953580,8955280," a lot of human generated data,"
8955280,8956100," we can just generate,"
8956100,8956980," data ourselves,"
8957780,8958100," right,"
8958100,8959060," so,"
8959060,8960300," yeah,"
8960300,8960920," that would be,"
8960920,8962060," another interesting thing,"
8962060,8962440," to tackle,"
8962440,8963140," but I first,"
8963140,8963860," would like to tackle,"
8963860,8965020," the summer,"
8965020,8966300," the thing that sums up,"
8966300,8967860," two numbers,"
8967860,8968180," right,"
8968180,8968720," but again,"
8968720,8969420," all of that,"
8969420,8970080," is already,"
8970080,8971280," for the next time,"
8971280,8972840," right,"
8972840,8973460," so,"
8973460,8974880," and to tackle,"
8974880,8975580," all of these,"
8975580,8977000," more complicated problems,"
8977000,8978280," we need to come up,"
8978280,8978480," with,"
8978480,8979380," adder,"
8979380,8979840," I'm sorry,"
8979840,8980200," yeah,"
8980200,8980700," so it's supposed,"
8980700,8981500," to be called adder,"
8981920,8983580," to tackle,"
8983580,8984880," these more complicated,"
8984880,8985940," problems,"
8985940,8987160," we need to come up,"
8987160,8987960," with the better,"
8987960,8988740," representations,"
8988740,8990000," of the neural network,"
8990000,8990940," because what the fuck,"
8990940,8991420," is this,"
8991420,8992740," excuse me,"
8992740,8994180," right,"
8994180,8995280," and you can clearly,"
8995280,8996480," see what kind of problems,"
8996480,8998180," it creates,"
8998180,8999080," just look at the,"
8999080,9000000," finite difference,"
9000000,9001200," like,"
9001200,9002180," what the fuck,"
9002180,9002780," is this shit,"
9002780,9005560," what,"
9005560,9006040," like,"
9006040,9006560," imagine,"
9006560,9006980," like,"
9006980,9007700," open AI,"
9007700,9009320," copy paste,"
9009320,9010220," in the same code,"
9010220,9011320," one trillion,"
9011520,9012060," of times,"
9012060,9013340," just to build,"
9013340,9014060," GPT4,"
9014060,9015080," like,"
9015080,9016400," what the fuck,"
9016400,9016920," is this shit,"
9016920,9017120," like,"
9017120,9017860," it's not a good,"
9017860,9018500," representation,"
9018500,9019360," right,"
9019360,9019760," so,"
9019760,9021060," we'll need to come up,"
9021060,9021700," with a better,"
9021700,9022280," representation,"
9022280,9022920," to tackle,"
9022920,9023980," more complicated,"
9023980,9024500," problems,"
9024500,9024980," right,"
9024980,9025900," and this is one,"
9025900,9026380," of the things,"
9026380,9027860," we may try to do,"
9027860,9028860," already,"
9028860,9030020," on the second episode,"
9030020,9031280," of machine learning,"
9031280,9031860," and see,"
9031860,9033220," right,"
9033220,9035720," anyways,"
9035720,9037640," that's it for today,"
9037640,9038960," I've been streaming,"
9038960,9040100," for almost three hours,"
9040100,9040840," and I usually stream,"
9041020,9041700," for two hours,"
9041700,9043560," thanks everyone,"
9043560,9044880," who's watching me right now,"
9044880,9046120," I really appreciate it,"
9046120,9047460," have a good one,"
9047460,9048400," and I see you,"
9048400,9049320," next time,"
9049320,9050780," I love you all,"
9050780,9051680," mwah!"
