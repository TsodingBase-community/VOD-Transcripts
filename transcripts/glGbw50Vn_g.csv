689980,719960," Thank you."
719960,749940," Thank you."
749960,755660," You pick up the one who's the most successful, the one who's the most fitest, and you slice"
755660,762440," your chromosomes in half and you cross over them and you cross over them and those you create"
762440,763160," a new generation."
763160,770320," On top of that, you also want to apply random mutations on the characters of the chromosome."
770320,779940," Characters are called genes, by the way."
779940,784900," stochastic events like stochastic mutations help you sometimes to get out of the local optimum and"
784900,792260," maybe find a better solution. So essentially you are emulating a natural selection. Right, so and"
792260,799080," what is our idea for this project? So we wanted to write a simple game where some sort of agents"
799080,805420," are trying to survive in an environment fighting for food and with each other. So the behavior of"
805420,811200," a single agent is described with a Turing machine style state machine that we call a chromosome."
811200,820420," So essentially we have a string of rows where we have the current state of the agent, what the agent"
820420,825380," sees right now, what's going to be the action that is going to happen in that particular state when the"
825380,830340," agent sees something and what state it has to switch to afterwards. So we have like a string of these"
830340,836020," sort of chromosomes that describe a behavior of the agent and the idea was to use genetic algorithm"
836020,842420," to fight an optimal behavior that survives the longest. Right, so we also have different kinds of"
842420,850740," entities, right, we have first of all agents, we have food and we have walls, right, food is meant to be"
850740,858100," eaten by the agents to actually let them survive longer, wall is an impenetrable obstacle and all of"
858100,865780," that is happening actually in a rectangular grid. This is, by the way, a screenshot of the game. Like I"
865780,871220," just generated as many entities as possible in like a very small space and it turned out to be a pretty"
871220,877140," good logo for the project, don't you think? So I really like how it looks like, so I decided to use"
877140,886660," this as a logo. So yeah, and also agents have different actions that they can perform in the"
886660,892820," environment, they can basically stay, do nothing, they can step forward, they can turn left, turn right, so"
892820,900820," they have four directions they can look at. They can attack, they can eat, and that's pretty much"
900820,906180," an intentional ram, by the way. So and all of that I wanted to document at some point, so I just put like"
906180,909780," some sort of like placeholders here, but in the future we're going to have all of that documented."
910500,919220," So yeah, so we already implemented the game simulation, right? So we have a game simulation and"
919220,928660," visualization. So the only thing we need to implement is the genetic algorithm itself. So you, I really"
928660,935300," recommend to check out this repo, so I'm trying to document as much as possible. So yeah, let's actually"
935300,940420," fetch all these changes, because I think I did a little bit of documentation of the screen, because"
940420,945460," it's not that interesting, and the things that I documented, I explained on the stream anyway. So"
945460,957220," merge origin master. All right, so hope everything I said makes sense. So by the way, we're using C, so"
957220,965140," pure C. Everything is written in pure C, the only dependencies we use is SDL and SDL GFX, just for graphics,"
965140,970580," and pretty much nothing else. Well, except maybe libc, because I mean, you need to use libc to interact"
970580,974740," with the operating system. How are we going to interact with the operating system using syscalls?"
974740,984740," It's not portable, okay? It's not portable. So this is how all of that looks like. So yeah, red triangles are"
984740,993620," the agents, green circles are the foot, and we're supposed to have walls somewhere. So here's the wall. It's an impenetrable wall."
994740,1001380," So yeah, by pressing space, you can actually step like a single simulation. As you can see, some of them made some steps,"
1001380,1007940," some of them moving, some of them doing some things, but majority of them are staying, and this is because"
1007940,1013460," their chromosomes are pepega. So after some time, they're all going to die, by the way, because they're going to"
1013460,1019300," run out of hunger. But look at that. Some of them survived. And the reason why some of them survived is"
1019300,1026660," because they managed to eat something. And this is basically the instances that we have to use for the"
1026660,1031940," further generations at some point, but we don't have that algorithm yet. But yeah, it's kind of funny. When"
1031940,1038580," you generate like a random genes, majority of the instances are going to be just pretty much useless."
1038580,1044100," So you're going to have like a few of them that you want to breed further. And what's funny is that"
1046500,1051300," we're just using like random chromosomes. We literally just use a rand function to generate"
1051300,1058500," a random chromosome. And they don't really perform really well. And I think this is because our rules"
1058500,1068020," are too complicated. Our rules are too complicated. Because we have separate actions for eating and"
1068020,1074100," separate actions for attacking. And I think that kind of complicates the entire system. So I think what we"
1074100,1079140," need to do instead, we need to get rid of those actions. We need to get rid of these actions and"
1079140,1087140," basically make eating basically going forward towards the food and attacking going forward towards the agent."
1087140,1091540," Right. I think it should be a little bit more simple. So it's a little bit easier to generate"
1091540,1096260," actually working chromosomes. Right. So we have this kind of steps or this kind of actions, eat, attack."
1096260,1100500," And of course, if you're trying to eat an agent, it's not going to work because you have to attack"
1100500,1104900," it first. And as you can see, it's too complicated. I think if we could get rid of these two actions,"
1104900,1111540," I think it would be way easier to work with. And the random chromosomes would actually produce more"
1111540,1115700," interesting results. And this is going to be our first step. We already have some to-dos"
1116420,1120500," that I planned for today. And one of them is actually simplifying the rules and getting"
1120500,1125540," rid of some of the actions that are kind of redundant, if you think about it. So let's"
1125540,1133060," actually find those to-dos. So yeah. Introduce action that many... Okay. So yeah, we need to simplify"
1133060,1137940," the rules of the game, remove actions, actions make moving towards the agent and attack, remove eat"
1137940,1143780," action, make moving towards food and eat, and so on and so forth. Yeah. So this is going to be our first step."
1144420,1151300," After that, after that, the next step is going to be introducing an action, a user action, not the agent"
1151300,1156500," action, the action that the user can do in the interface, that manually generates a new generation."
1156500,1162740," So essentially, it will take the agents that survived the longest, cross over their genes, mutate them,"
1162740,1168180," and then create a new generation and start a new run. So we're going to actually like run this algorithm"
1168180,1173620," step-by-step manually first, just to get the gist of how all that works. And once all of that done,"
1173620,1180980," we can try to automate that and actually try to calculate all that offline without user interaction."
1180980,1187860," And then we'll be able to look at the final results of the algorithm. So does it make sense? Sounds"
1187860,1195300," like a plan. Sounds like a feasible plan for today. What do you guys think? So yeah. Yeah, that's pretty much it."
1200100,1207620," All right. Cool. Let's get farted. Let's get farted. So maybe I'm going to start by creating the branch,"
1207620,1211220," right? Because we already have some sort of like a well-defined issues."
1212660,1216900," Simplify rules. So we're simplifying rules."
1216900,1231700," So I'm going to go to the place where we have rules defined. Here they are. And I'm going to simply go"
1231700,1237540," ahead and remove these two actions and just go through the compilation errors. So right now, effectively,"
1237540,1243300," we have four actions, nothing step, turn left and turn right. Um,"
1243300,1247700," so, and let's just build the entire thing and see how it's going to go."
1247700,1254340," All right. So, uh, action as sister. So this is needed for rendering."
1254340,1260100," So let's remove that. What's next. Okay. So action it."
1260100,1265700," Uh, so we need to move that logic"
1266660,1270100," two step. Right. So, um,"
1270100,1277460," what we need to do here, we basically need to sequentially check, uh, what kind of stuff do we"
1277460,1284900," see in front of ourselves? Right. So, uh, if we see the food in front of ourselves, um,"
1284900,1293460," we have to try to eat that food. So, and of course we need to remove that, uh, that eat here. Um,"
1294260,1297780," if we see something else, um,"
1297780,1308020," it's kind of interesting. So we found the food and can I do break to break out of this branch and not"
1308020,1312740," continue anything else? That would be actually pretty cool, but I think it would complicate things."
1312740,1318020," It would be better to have something else if, but unfortunately with else if, um,"
1318020,1323860," I want to be able to define a variable like that and it doesn't really allow me to do that."
1323860,1326100," So I think I'm going to try to go with the break."
1326100,1334660," Um, so basically break here and it will break out of the branch. It's kind of like unconventional way of doing this kind of thing."
1334660,1337540," Uh, but I think it's going to work for our case."
1337540,1342260," Um, all right. It's the next thing. Agent, uh, other agent,"
1342260,1350500," agent in front of agents. So what we're doing here, we're just checking if there is any agent in front of us, right?"
1350500,1361540," Agent index. There we go. And if we do have something, other agent not equal null, right? We're going to try to attack that agent."
1362180,1364660," Uh, and this is essentially how we do all of that"
1364660,1369300," Right. We're attacking that agent. Oh, we already"
1369300,1372500," We already have that logic here. Um,"
1372500,1377860," Okay, so and that also gets rid of the attack. So let's not, uh, forget"
1377860,1380900," Uh, this to do this to do is quite important"
1380900,1385780," Uh, boom, boom"
1385780,1391940," So and the next thing we want to do probably is to check whether we have the wall"
1392180,1394340," Right. So after that, by the way, we have to do break"
1394340,1398340," We have to do break"
1398340,1406020," And, um, maybe I can do something like this wall wall wall"
1406020,1408740," Uh in front"
1408740,1411380," Jesus fucking christ"
1411380,1412340," Wall of sea"
1412340,1415940," Uh, so this is game agent index"
1416580,1419300," Uh, uh, right and if"
1419300,1421220," Wall"
1421220,1427140," Equal null if we don't see any wall here what we have to do we have to step it"
1427140,1429540," So it's logic logic is slightly different actually"
1429540,1432340," If we don't have a wall we have to step"
1432340,1434340," Um, but yeah"
1434340,1441060," I'd like to i'd really like to replace these breaks with a chain of if else"
1441780,1444500," But I have no idea how to do that can I define"
1444500,1452180," Foo and instantly assign it or something like that it will be actually pretty cool to have something like this"
1452180,1457140," Is that a thing I can do or at least use a sequential operator?"
1457140,1462740," Does anybody know if I can do things like that because here's the sequential operator in the sequential operator?"
1462740,1466660," I define a variable and then I instantly like use it and stuff like that"
1467780,1473700," I think it actually we need to make an experiment because that would be super useful if it is a thing in c"
1473700,1475940," I know that you can do something like that and go"
1475940,1478260," But you can't do that and see god damn it"
1478260,1481940," Uh, do I have to do I really have to suffer?"
1481940,1484340," Do I really have to suffer?"
1484340,1490100," Declarations are in expressions, but the sequential operator is an expression is it not?"
1490100,1492740," right, so"
1493620,1497220," Because like if you have this kind of thing and you have like"
1497220,1500980," Um, all right"
1500980,1503940," You need to suffer I see"
1503940,1510180," Okay, let's just go ahead and suffer I suppose"
1510180,1514500," Um, but we can just use break here in that case"
1514500,1518260," You can just use a break"
1518820,1521380," All right, so I think I handled everything"
1521380,1522260," um"
1522260,1535380," But what if we predefine all of these variables and then just use them later"
1535380,1540820," Wait a second. I want i'm going to give it a try"
1541540,1547540," Uh, so what if I already have this variable and then I can do something like x equal five"
1547540,1549300," Will that work?"
1549300,1551060," Yes"
1551060,1556180," Uh, just see maybe let's see it will work"
1556180,1560260," Okay"
1560260,1564340," And then it says yes"
1566180,1568900," Yeah, all right, so we can try to do something like that"
1568900,1575620," We can try to do something like that and essentially just pre-define all of these variables here"
1575620,1576980," to be fair"
1576980,1584500," Why not just find all of these things right away, but I mean it it actually wastes time"
1584500,1588340," Right, so it would be better to to do it slightly differently"
1588980,1591220," So, uh, I'm gonna do it like that"
1591220,1592660," There we go"
1592660,1593540," Food not equal"
1593540,1595620," Then other agent"
1595620,1606740," It's funny for the for the wall we don't really need the wall itself"
1606740,1608340," Right, we just need to check"
1608340,1612500," Hello, ChromosomeDrift, welcome to the stream. Welcome, welcome, welcome"
1612500,1614900," Uh, so essentially"
1616420,1618660," Yeah, I can do null here then"
1618660,1624420," Null here and I can get rid of these breaks now by essentially doing"
1624420,1629060," Else and just joining all of that, but I mean it takes a little bit of"
1629060,1632100," Space the the lines are too long"
1632100,1634340," But maybe"
1634340,1638740," Yeah, because I don't really like that break because it kind of like messes with my brain"
1638740,1643780," And uh, the flow the control flow is a little bit more obvious when you do it like that"
1643780,1645540," But at the same time it's kind of scuffed"
1645540,1652340," So, all right, so let's go back"
1652340,1654740," Let's go back. Let's actually try to"
1654740,1658900," Uh to find all of that and just keep it like that"
1667780,1668740," So it's gonna be else"
1668740,1671380," This one is gonna be else"
1671380,1676500," There we go. So more or less okay, I think more or less okay"
1676500,1679780," Let's continue with the and of course break we should remove the break"
1679780,1685700," So if we have a food in front of us, we eat the food if we have other agent in front of us, we attack the agent"
1686340,1691060," If we don't have a ball in front of us, we just step forward nothing nothing special"
1691060,1693380," Uh, all right looks good to me"
1693380,1699700," So let's rebuild everything. Let's rebuild everything and uh, that's it that actually apparently it"
1699700,1704740," Uh, you don't have to do anything special that that was actually too easy"
1704740,1710740," Too fucking easy mate. Uh, why is it so easy? Okay, so let's actually try to run it"
1711780,1716340," Did they create such a good code that uh changing the rules is so easy there?"
1716340,1718820," All right, so now we're stepping"
1718820,1721140," and I suppose since"
1721140,1723460," Yeah"
1723460,1724340," Oh"
1724340,1725620," You know, what's funny?"
1725620,1726420," You know, what's funny?"
1726420,1730100," They actually after eating the food they don't step"
1730100,1735940," Which is kind of which is kind of sad, but uh, this time more things survived. You know what?"
1735940,1741300," I would like to change here. I would like to also step after they've eaten the food"
1741940,1746260," Right, so something like this. Let's also step here. So we've eaten the food"
1746260,1750260," Um, we increase the hunger"
1750260,1755700," Uh, and we just stepped forward, uh replacing the food"
1755700,1757380," Uh, all right"
1757380,1758500," So"
1758500,1761860," Uh, let's actually wait a little bit"
1761860,1765460," Uh-huh, uh-huh"
1765460,1768420," Let's see until uh more of them die"
1768420,1769940," And uh"
1769940,1774420," Yeah, so we have some of them that survived and wonder for how long they're gonna survive"
1774420,1775620," Uh"
1775620,1777780," Not for that long, but yeah"
1777780,1781380," Now I like how some of them just rotate forever"
1781380,1786660," Right, because uh, you know the chromosomes that control their behavior they are randomly generated"
1786660,1789700," So that's why sometimes you you may get a spinning voice"
1790260,1791060," Um"
1791060,1794100," You saw one of them stepping into the food"
1794100,1798260," We can actually reduce the size of the board so it makes it a little bit more obvious"
1798260,1800420," Uh, what is going on?"
1800420,1803140," So, um, I think it's somewhere in the game"
1803140,1805700," So let's actually do something like 2020"
1806340,1810900," And let's reduce the amount of agents we have 2000 of the agents jesus christ"
1810900,1812100," Let's put like 10 of them"
1812100,1813300," Uh"
1813300,1814740," And 10 foods"
1814740,1817780," All right, so"
1817780,1820900," Huh"
1820900,1823780," For some reason that one stopped"
1823780,1824500," I don't know why"
1824500,1830340," Yeah, some of them just spinning spinning around"
1830340,1832420," Without doing anything"
1832420,1834100," You really need like"
1835780,1837700," Some of them it ate the food as you can see"
1837700,1841860," And"
1841860,1843940," Yeah, this one survived the longest"
1843940,1848020," And this is probably the one that we're going to use to uh generate the next generation"
1848020,1850180," Hello is the config welcome to the stream"
1850180,1852180," Welcome, welcome, welcome"
1852180,1859220," But yeah, so you really need to generate like several thousands of them to actually get some interesting behaviors like that actually work"
1859220,1861380," Like if you have like 10 of them, they"
1861380,1862820," They all be pego"
1863460,1866660," Um, yeah, they're definitely all pego"
1866660,1869060," That's why i'm generating like two thousands of them"
1869060,1873540," Uh, all right, so let's actually give go back to a lot of them"
1873540,1876260," Hello neutral second welcome to the stream"
1876260,1879060," And as you can see like we generated more uh things here"
1879060,1880180," Uh"
1880180,1887060," And at some point some of them are gonna even survive that's pretty cool"
1887060,1890180," That's pretty cool. All right, so uh"
1890180,1893460," Let me remove this thing"
1895060,1904340," Um, I want to take a look at the to do's that we have"
1904340,1909540," Oh my kitchen dropped, uh, we need to simplify the rules of the game"
1909540,1917380," Yeah, that's exactly what I did. I think I in fact simplified the rules of the game. That was actually easier than I expected"
1918180,1921380," Uh remove action eat"
1921380,1925140," And action uh attack"
1925140,1929620," Inaction it in action attack and we're going to push that right into the repo"
1929620,1932740," Okay, cool, um"
1932740,1937700," So and I suppose that issue is done. So I'll have to go to master and"
1937700,1940180," merge everything"
1940180,1941860," Without fast forwarding"
1941860,1944260," Uh, there we go. Let me just remove this branch"
1944260,1947620," So as you can see now this transaction is over"
1947620,1955860," Uh, I don't have a pool, uh, like I don't have a ci to test things out. Maybe I should set up the ci"
1955860,1961300," Yeah, I think I should uh in case of somebody will want to contribute something"
1961300,1966820," Or also to check my own code on other platforms like macros and whatnot"
1967380,1969380," That would be actually pretty cool"
1969380,1976340," Because ci is very important especially in the era of open source where a lot of people contributing to your project"
1976340,1978900," You need to keep the quality of the source code high"
1978900,1981460," Right and ci is usually help you with that"
1981460,1988420," All right, so"
1988420,1991300," Let's maybe set up the ci"
1991300,1994500," Contributing animations you only contribute animations"
1996100,2001300," That's an interesting that's an interesting idea like actually when they rotate but they rotate smoothly"
2001300,2004820," And stuff like that. That's actually not easy and not an easy task to be fair"
2004820,2008100," Because you need to do all of like the whole engine that will do that"
2008100,2011700," And stuff like that, um"
2011700,2016500," All right, so the next issue is going to be introducing the action"
2016500,2020820," Um, or maybe make agents drop the food when they die"
2020820,2023380," Is that a good idea?"
2024020,2026100," Make agents drop food when they die?"
2026100,2032580," So but when do they die we don't register their"
2032580,2036180," Death right away or do we?"
2040100,2042660," This is sokoban level of complexity. Yeah, I suppose"
2042660,2045940," Help eating food"
2045940,2053300," All right, let's focus on something more interesting actually"
2053300,2058260," Let's focus on the action that generates a new generation creates a new generation"
2058260,2062660," I don't want to repeat myself creates a new generation based on the best"
2063460,2067860," Performing agents right so uh introduce an action that manually"
2067860,2070180," Generates a new generation. Okay"
2070180,2072740," So what we do already"
2072740,2074740," Uh in the game"
2074740,2077140," So let's actually find the agent"
2077140,2084180," Agent we already keep track of the agent's lifetime lifetime is basically how many steps they made"
2084900,2085620," Uh, right"
2085620,2090020," And if they're dead they're not making any steps anymore"
2090020,2091380," So what we need to do here"
2091380,2097540," We need to grab all of the agents and just sort them in a descent in order of their lifetime and pick like"
2097540,2100980," Five the best or something like that and just look at them"
2100980,2104020," Uh, does each step increase the hunger?"
2104020,2109220," Yes, it does. Well, I mean it's hunger like we have an opposite of a hanger like it's actually decreasing it"
2109220,2114260," But yeah, so over time they they will need to find some food to eat. Otherwise, they're gonna die"
2114260,2116980," So that's actually quite quite important"
2116980,2122900," Um, so what we need to do here is uh introduce some sort of action"
2122900,2128900," That will give you the best agents somehow"
2128900,2133220," Um, so let's do something like this"
2134020,2136020," print"
2136020,2137620," uh"
2137620,2138980," Best agents"
2138980,2141860," Right, so we're gonna ex uh get the game"
2141860,2145780," We're gonna get the game and"
2145780,2152660," Uh, probably the place where you want to print all of that just in case why not and maybe how many of them you want to print"
2152660,2156820," All right, maybe how many you want to print them print of them"
2156820,2162740," Uh, and we essentially gonna call that function"
2163540,2167540," When we press n right, so this is going to be std out for now"
2167540,2173300," Then we'll have to provide the game and we're going to print like five of the best, right?"
2173300,2174820," So this is going to be our function"
2174820,2178820," Hmm"
2178820,2183700," Uh a equal can someone explain how it works it actually"
2183700,2190820," Uh exploits a comma operator. I would recommend you to uh check out a comma operator"
2191460,2192980," Operator in c"
2192980,2198420," Yeah, yeah, so thank you jenny. So the idea is the following actually in a comma operator"
2198420,2205220," Uh, in a comma operator, you can have even statements. I think yeah, you can even have some some sort of stuff"
2205220,2207940," Right. For example, you have function f"
2208660,2211060," Then you put uh"
2211060,2215540," Function g and then 69 and after that you can do something like this"
2215540,2221540," Right, so this is a valid c code and consequently a c++ code. What is going on here?"
2224980,2232660," So first the code will call this function, right? So if you have a function f it will be called first"
2232660,2235460," Right, and if it performs any side effects"
2235460,2238260," They will be performed"
2238260,2240020," Right, so then"
2240660,2242580," uh, it will call function g"
2242580,2244340," Right"
2244340,2250420," And if it has any side effects, they will be visible and then"
2250420,2255140," Uh, it takes the last expression of this sequence"
2255140,2259460," And returns this as the value of this entire expression. So"
2260260,2264500," We will call f g and then we will assign 69 to x"
2264500,2266420," Does it make sense?"
2266420,2268100," So essentially comma operator is"
2268100,2273220," Uh, the sequential operator. It takes like expressions and execute them sequentially"
2273220,2278500," Then it takes the last expression and makes it the value of that expression the value of the whole sequence"
2278500,2282740," Not sure if it makes sense, but you may try to read more about that on the internet"
2283060,2287780," And this is essentially what I exploit here, right? So I have a variable then what I want to do here"
2287780,2294100," I want to assign some sort of value to that variable and instantly check what was that value"
2294100,2296820," Make sense?"
2296820,2299380," So yeah, this is what I use here"
2299380,2306980," And since the expression of this entire thing the value of this entire thing is the value of the last thing"
2306980,2310180," It is equivalent of just this"
2310660,2314420," But with an additional side effect of uh, this first thing"
2314420,2320180," Um, you can also do it like that. Yeah, sure. So, uh, thank you jing"
2320180,2325940," Thank you. I think i'm more complicating things. I don't know. Maybe go damaged my brain, but"
2325940,2330500," uh, go essentially like allows you to have things like that. I think"
2330500,2336980," Uh, i'm not quite sure, but I remember that one one of the languages enabled you with that and it's actually quite useful pattern"
2336980,2339620," Uh, but yeah, um"
2340660,2342660," All right, cool"
2342660,2350100," I'm gonna give away your hair to charity or grow them long and show them to tourists for 20 dollars worth of rubble"
2350100,2355460," Yes"
2357940,2364900," All right, so we need to implement this function that prints five best uh, five base engines"
2364900,2368740," Um, if you're in straw strip more like base structure"
2369540,2377540," uh, so print best agents uh game cpp"
2377540,2381780," So what I want to do here, I probably want to actually"
2381780,2382980," um"
2382980,2393220," Just sort all of them, but I need to allocate like enough memory for all of that. Hi mikovie. Welcome to the stream. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. How are you doing?"
2394900,2395620," To be fair"
2395620,2400180," I can use the memory of the game itself, right?"
2400180,2405060," I wanted to copy the agents from the game and sort them by their lifetime"
2405060,2409780," But why do I have to do that you can if I can sort them right inside of the game"
2409780,2414500," Right, so let's actually make printing this entire stuff modify the state of the game"
2414500,2418420," Right, so it's going to modify the state of the game and what it's going to do is gonna"
2418980,2420980," Uh, you know sort them"
2420980,2425140," By their you know lifetime and just pick the five ones"
2425140,2430740," So, um, uh, we're gonna use qsort to do that"
2430740,2435540," Q qsort"
2435540,2443540," By the way, do I have a man page for qsort? I should I should yow would you look at that"
2444420,2448500," Wait a second qsort or is that a reversed one?"
2448500,2453460," Is it that you can accept its comparison function take a third argument?"
2453460,2459700," Uh a pointer is based in comparison. I don't think it's a reversed one. God damn it"
2459700,2466340," Anyway, so, uh, we need some sort of a comparison function, right? We need some sort of comparison function"
2467860,2470660," Uh, and we're going to implement that, uh, pretty soon"
2470660,2475540," Um"
2475540,2476820," Compare"
2476820,2478340," Compare agents"
2478340,2483620," Lifetimes, right? And we're going to accept pointer const pointer to"
2483620,2486820," the agent"
2486820,2489060," All right, so agent let's call it agent a"
2489060,2492260," and agent"
2492260,2493940," b"
2493940,2498820," Right and that is going to return zero and we're going to implement it a little bit later"
2498820,2500900," So we're going to assert zero"
2500900,2505860," To do and we're going to say compare agent lifetimes is not implemented"
2505860,2508660," It's not implemented"
2508660,2515860," So what we're trying to sort here we're trying to start agents and how many agents we have right now"
2515860,2522100," We have agents count amount of agents and what is the size of a single agent? Well, it's the size of"
2522740,2524420," Agent agent. There we go. So"
2524420,2529460," Yeah, since uh, c doesn't have any templates or anything like that"
2529460,2534020," You have to pass as much information about the shape of the data as possible"
2534020,2538660," In c++ in that case you would derive that shape from the types"
2538660,2543620," Right, so because you can pass type parameters, but in c you cannot pass type parameters"
2543620,2546660," So we have to explicitly pass the sizes of the types"
2546660,2551460," Um, yeah, but it is what it is. I mean it's limitations of the language"
2552020,2554020," And uh, then um"
2554020,2559460," We're going to do compare agents lifetimes. So this is going to be our uh comparison"
2559460,2563060," Generic, it's not gonna solve much"
2563060,2566820," You're debating me into the rent again giant stop"
2575300,2576740," And this code generic ptsd"
2576740,2578100," Anyway"
2578100,2581380," So this is how we're going to sort a little bit"
2581380,2586900," Uh, all right. Do I have to include the city? I think I already included std leap"
2586900,2589300," Uh, yeah, here it is"
2589300,2596500," Epic assert. Yeah epic assert was pretty epic. I'm not gonna lie"
2597220,2597860," I'm not gonna lie"
2597860,2603060," So and here's an interesting thing. I could have just iterated"
2603060,2609540," Through zero to n and just print the corresponding agents"
2609540,2612740," To the stream then game agent"
2612740,2615540," I or something like that"
2616660,2622180," But what if n is greater than agent account, right?"
2622180,2624980," So I think we're gonna do this kind of switcher"
2624980,2627060," Right? So we're gonna make it different"
2627060,2629300," Um, all right"
2629300,2633380," Is it gonna work? It does it does not even compile properly"
2633380,2636420," Passing argument for uh from incompatible pointer type"
2636420,2639060," But do you even care about that?"
2639060,2641620," Uh, why do you even care about that?"
2641620,2643220," Huh"
2643220,2649780," Do I really have to accept void star and just cast it internally?"
2649780,2654660," I thought c is actually pretty liberal in that sense. I mean, oh my god"
2654660,2657140," Come on"
2657140,2661060," Hello gp brub zero. Welcome. Welcome to the stream. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello"
2661540,2664100," Post agent agent a"
2664100,2667940," Switcherunie. Yeah"
2667940,2673060," Yeah, I should be able to do this thing kind of thing"
2673060,2676180," So we haven't used variables. That's okay"
2676180,2683060," Uh, and you uh, so what is this one unknown size t? There we go. Is it gonna work and"
2683060,2686500," Uh agent c"
2686500,2691380," Uh, yeah, the function pointer type don't let you cast like that. Okay, so it works"
2691540,2694580," For other kind of pointers, but it doesn't work for function, but I see"
2694580,2697140," So, thank you jean"
2697140,2702020," Uh incompatible type of the print, uh, I think it has to be a pointer"
2702020,2705060," Yeah, it has to be a pointer"
2705060,2708100," It's like this you always see"
2708100,2714020," Oh, yeah, it's it's basically a problem of covariance and contravariance. Okay. Okay. I see. I see what's going on here"
2714900,2720340," Since you're an epic java developer, you know, what is the covariance countervariance and why there's problems with"
2720340,2722980," Things like that. Yeah"
2722980,2724820," God damn"
2724820,2726820," It's been a long time. No"
2726820,2730420," I'm sorry"
2730420,2735220," You're gonna be an epic java developer"
2735220,2740260," Well, yeah, I would not recommend to be to become a java developer"
2740980,2742980," Um, seriously because"
2742980,2751140," Uh, first of all, it's not that much of a pleasant work. I mean depends on who who's who's doing it for some people. It's actually"
2751140,2752900," Pretty cool"
2752900,2755780," But the problem is that there's a huge demand on java developers"
2755780,2760260," So if you work as a java developer once on a commercial project"
2760260,2764660," It will be super fucking hard to get out of that"
2766260,2772100," Out of that area because it like every hr is gonna call you to work in java again"
2772100,2777940," Like everyone you already have experience in commercial project in java. Yeah, go work for us go work for us"
2777940,2780900," They're gonna throw money at you as much money as possible"
2780900,2784580," And it's gonna be super hard to get away from that. Seriously"
2784580,2788580," Um, yeah, so i'm just sharing my experience for you. So"
2788580,2791380," Be super careful with that"
2791380,2793380," um"
2793380,2795380," Hmm"
2795380,2798580," Once you got a commercial experience with java"
2798580,2804260," It's gonna be really hard. It's gonna be really fucking hard because a huge money is gonna be at the stake"
2804260,2807620," No, not the money, please"
2812500,2814980," looks around nobody's throwing money. I mean"
2814980,2819060," You have to become unemployed first"
2819060,2821060," I suppose"
2821060,2823060," I'm not suggesting that though"
2823060,2828820," um"
2828820,2833300," Uh, okay, so we need to implement the compare agents lifetimes"
2837620,2839620," Um, so"
2839620,2846100," Can you pass lambda into the sword? Uh, see it doesn't support lambdas unfortunately"
2846100,2850660," It would it would be cool if it did actually it would be pretty cool if it did"
2850660,2852500," um"
2852500,2856340," In zip plus you can pass a lambda that doesn't capture"
2856340,2859540," Wait a second"
2859540,2864500," Is that like a standardized feature that you can pass a lambda that"
2864500,2866820," It's it's gonna work correctly"
2866820,2871460," So the lambda that doesn't capture will be compiled like as a regular function"
2872900,2874900," Fucking really"
2874900,2882180," Wait a fucking second. No, wait, wait, wait, wait. I want to fucking try that. Uh, excuse me. That's actually very interesting"
2882180,2887140," Uh, no caption lambda can indicate to function pointers. I see"
2887140,2889780," All right, um"
2889780,2894660," So we're gonna do main c++. I'm really sorry, but yeah, I want to check it out"
2895300,2898740," I actually want to check it out. So we're gonna do cstdio"
2898740,2904100," See it's to the lib and i'm gonna just have like a think"
2904100,2908820," Surprise surprise suppose not bad of a language"
2908820,2914100," Yeah, I see. Uh, well, that's fucking awesome actually. Uh, yeah"
2914100,2919220," That may make me want to use lambda more. Thank you so much for telling me"
2919220,2925060," Uh, yeah, that's actually super cool. So and let's actually do something like access size"
2925540,2932340," Exercise size of axis divided by size of axis zero, right? And we're going to do q sort"
2932340,2940180," Access so what was the next one? I forgot to sort let me copy paste this kind of thing"
2940180,2947620," So the base is going to be axis the amount of elements is going to be exercise"
2947620,2951140," Then the size of a single element is"
2952740,2960340," Size of axis zero and instead of this kind of thing. We're going to do a comparison. I wonder if I can do something like this a and b"
2960340,2965220," And essentially the comparison operator is uh, something like this, right?"
2965220,2972340," So essentially if a is less than b is going to return a negative value is if the if their equal is going to be zero"
2972340,2976740," If a b is greater than a is going to return you like a positive value"
2976740,2978740," I think this is how it's going to work properly"
2978740,2980020," probably"
2980020,2983940," Um, okay, so what we can do here we can try to print this entire thing"
2983940,2987540," Uh exercise"
2987540,2990100," Uh print f uh"
2990100,2993060," d"
2993060,2995940," Exercise"
2995940,2998340," And after that, of course, we want to print a new line"
3000500,3006420," And uh somewhere here we want to print something like that. Okay, so let's try to compile this entire thingy"
3006420,3011460," Uh doesn't compile because uh, why invalid use of const void?"
3011460,3014820," Oh, shit, okay, so um"
3014820,3023940," Okay, can I do something like this then so it's gonna be well, I mean at least it actually it actually like thrown"
3024740,3030740," Like a type error that is sort of relevant to what i'm doing here, which is pretty fucking cool. I think"
3030740,3034260," It fucking work. I mean it fucking compiles"
3034260,3039380," All right"
3039380,3047220," For fuck's sake oh my god, uh i'm gonna give you vip. Thank you so much"
3049940,3054980," This is so cool. All right, all right, all right, all right, so it's literally like a function"
3054980,3062660," Nice, thank you so much"
3062660,3068580," Uh, that is fucking cool. That is so fucking cool. I love it"
3075860,3077860," Oh, it was your idea"
3077860,3081060," All right, I'm gonna give you vip as well talk wild"
3081060,3086980," I'm i'm really sorry. I cannot give you the real vip yet"
3086980,3089860," You've been around not for too long"
3089860,3093780," So"
3093780,3098020," I don't really know you that well, but maybe if you stay around for quite some time"
3098020,3104260," Maybe at some point you will get you'll get a vip, but that's actually pretty cool"
3104820,3106820," Um, yeah"
3106820,3109300," Thank you. Thank you so much, everyone"
3109300,3111540," Uh, I should probably read more about lambdas"
3111540,3117940," Like I briefly read about them and use them, but never knew much details like that on them"
3117940,3123220," Cinderity worm"
3123220,3124900," What the hell is that?"
3124900,3126900," Uh, thank you so much for"
3126900,3132660," A year of tier one subscription. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you and welcome to our epic c plus plus club"
3133140,3135140," How about that so what is that?"
3135140,3140660," All right"
3140660,3141700," Since it's a"
3141700,3145860," So yeah, it's like anniversary of your subscription"
3147620,3149620," Uh, it's pain"
3149620,3149620," It's pure pain"
3149620,3155460," I do understand you and that's why we're gonna listen to this song"
3155460,3160740," So this is for you. This is for a year of subscription my gut"
3160740,3163140," Imagine being subscribed for a year"
3163940,3165940," this is for you"
3165940,3174260," All right, so, uh, let's continue"
3174260,3178820," um"
3179300,3186980," Uh, yeah, but I'm I cannot use lambda, uh, right because it's a c so I still have to create a separate function for all of that"
3186980,3189780," I still have to create separate function"
3192580,3194580," So and this is kind of similar"
3194580,3197380," I think"
3197380,3200340," So i'll have to do"
3200340,3203540," Legend a"
3203540,3210100," TGS didn't try to pronounce the link. Yeah, I mean maybe the text that it uh, send the link somebody send the link"
3210100,3213540," And it just didn't do that because there's no point to do that"
3214100,3216100," Um, okay, so let's take lifetimes"
3216100,3229620," What's interesting is that it's gonna sort them in increasing order"
3229620,3232260," So for a decreasing order"
3232260,3235380," For descending order, I think we have to do something like this"
3235380,3241780," What they're coding now i'm programming"
3242420,3251380," I'm experimenting with genetic algorithms. You can find more information here. Thank you. Thank you to six and also check out the playlist of the previous parts of"
3251380,3256020," This genetic programming experimentation. So it's actually pretty interesting"
3256020,3258820," Um, yeah"
3258820,3261300," So I suppose this is how we're gonna set them in the"
3261300,3263940," reversed order"
3263940,3266020," And that should just work"
3266020,3272100," So and also we don't print the lifetime. Let me quickly try to print the lifetime"
3272420,3274420," There we go"
3274420,3276740," There we go"
3276740,3279940," Let's try to recompile all that"
3279940,3284980," I'm new to stream only cpp"
3284980,3289380," We're actually programming all sorts of languages for program in c c plus plus"
3289380,3291860," Rust"
3291860,3293860," D"
3293860,3295860," Haskell"
3295860,3296580," javascript"
3296580,3296580," javascript"
3296580,3299940," Um, so it it actually depends"
3299940,3302580," So I would really recommend you to check out"
3302580,3306580," Our schedule for a different project"
3306580,3311940," Um, and also check out our organization on github because we store all of the"
3311940,3314820," um, all the projects there"
3314820,3315140," Right"
3315140,3316100," So"
3316100,3320980," Yeah, so we'll also program in assembly from from time to time"
3321780,3323780," Type script as you can see"
3323780,3326100," Uh, what else do we have?"
3326100,3331700," Uh, we have go we program in go d elm, but we programmed in a long time ago"
3331700,3333700," Uh apparently java"
3333700,3334900," Uh sure"
3334900,3339860," Um, but yeah, so we program in all sorts of languages. So welcome"
3339860,3343700," To our multi-language uh channel"
3343700,3348980," So mostly low-level languages, uh, how do you find a low-level language?"
3350420,3352420," So"
3352420,3355700," What is a low-level language? What is a high-level language?"
3355700,3363780," Is there any criteria?"
3363780,3367060," Um, all right"
3367060,3376820," So, uh, let's just run the game then"
3379460,3379700," Cool"
3379700,3385620," Yeah, low-level, no python"
3385620,3390340," That's a very interesting criteria of high-level and low-level"
3390340,3398900," All right, so we're gonna wait until everyone dies and only several of them survives"
3398900,3406020," All right, that was a beautiful beautiful beautiful song. Thank you. Thank you so much. Uh, let's continue listening to something else"
3408020,3409220," Um"
3409220,3420500," And maybe js, but what's the criteria? How do you know that js is a high-level programming language and something that is not js is not?"
3420500,3424020," Like what is the criteria? It's so arbitrary"
3424020,3425300," like"
3425300,3426340," uh"
3426340,3428500," low-level no gc, but what about go"
3429140,3432100," In go you can even have like segmentation faults"
3432100,3437060," In the higher level language, you can fucking have segmentation faults and it has a gc"
3437060,3438100," What's the criteria?"
3438100,3440820," Hmm? Tell me tell me tell me tell me"
3442260,3444420," Thanks for suffering from you, Mr. Tsung, you're welcome"
3444420,3447940," You're welcome"
3447940,3452420," Uh, thank you for for joining the streams and do it too warm. Um, I'm really glad to see you"
3453700,3454900," Um, so"
3454900,3458980," Let's wait until all of them die. Um"
3458980,3465300," Okay, some some of them died and we have some of them that didn't die"
3465300,3471620," Uh, we're gonna wait a little bit and uh, we're gonna press n and n is supposed to print the best of them"
3471860,3473860," Right, so it prints the best of them"
3473860,3478660," Uh, and as you can see all of them have lifetime of 21"
3478660,3481620," Uh, but I wonder if we can have like see"
3481620,3486100," What is the average? Yeah, so they all have hunger like five"
3486100,3490260," And stuff like that, but these were the best of them"
3490260,3498900," How if p can be a low level"
3500420,3505620," I have a feeling that nobody knows what low level and high level means in this shit"
3505620,3507860," Do you even know what you guys talking about?"
3507860,3510820," How do you know low what is low level and what is a high level?"
3510820,3515780," Uh, lower level equals machine code everything else is high"
3515780,3518580," Well, at least it's some sort of criteria, right?"
3518580,3520340," At least it's already better"
3520340,3524660," Python, javascript, uh, uh, low, uh, I don't know"
3524660,3528980," Like whatever you suggested already better than majority of people said so far"
3528980,3529380," So"
3529380,3539620," Uh, how can agent with the health zero be in top five because the performance um"
3539620,3542980," The health of the agent is irrelevant to its performance"
3550020,3566180," All right, so but what I would also like to print the corresponding chromosomes of the agents"
3566180,3570100," So I think that will be also pretty cool"
3571540,3574420," But the problem is that chromosomes are not part of the agents"
3574420,3578660," Right, uh, these the agents are it's their states"
3578660,3582580," But maybe this should be a part of their um"
3582580,3585060," With the agents. I have not decided yet"
3587460,3593860," Yeah, let's actually uh, make a small switcheruny super quick and i'm gonna make chromosomes part of the agents"
3593860,3595780," Maybe it will actually simplify things"
3596820,3601220," Um, so where's the agent definition? So here's the agent"
3601220,3604500," And where do we have a chromosomes? Uh, there we go"
3606020,3609300," Uh chroma chroma chroma"
3609300,3615140," Oh, we have uh, 45 raiders from kebabskull"
3615140,3621300," Uh, thank you. Thank you for the rate and hello raiders. So we're doing a genetic program. How about that?"
3622020,3626500," Uh, check out the uh, the project command to learn more about this kind of stuff"
3626500,3629540," And this is the third part of genetic programming"
3629540,3631940," So check out the playlist for the previous part"
3631940,3635700," So yeah, essentially we're just making like a small hunger games thingy"
3635700,3639300," Where we have like small agents that move around"
3639300,3642820," And their behavior is described with chromosomes"
3642820,3650260," And we're going to use genetic algorithm to breed the fittest agent that can survive the longest in the environment"
3650820,3652980," So that's essentially what we're doing here today"
3652980,3659460," So yeah, and recording all of that and see so yeah, stay tuned if you're interested in this kind of stuff"
3659460,3662900," Um"
3662900,3674180," Maybe levelness of some languages can be determined by the amount of hard-coded built-in abstractions"
3674180,3677620," uh"
3680820,3686980," Maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe"
3686980,3690980," Uh, so and I want to get rid of the chromosome"
3690980,3695780," So now we only have agents. We only have foods and only we have only walls"
3695780,3701140," How do you measure performance? Um, essentially for how long the agents lived"
3701140,3703300," So we're optimizing their lifetime"
3703300,3708980," If they lived uh, the longest that means we're going to use them for the next generation of the genetic algorithm"
3710340,3714740," Um, yeah, that's gonna be the idea so they have hunger and they have health"
3714740,3719060," They can find food and eat it and they also can fight with each other"
3719060,3722980," Right, so and having this combination of things that can kill them"
3722980,3725860," Uh contribute to how long they may live"
3725860,3729540," So yeah, they have to survive as long as possible"
3731220,3735300," All right, so what do we have here so we don't have a chromosomes here and"
3735300,3748180," So what I have to do here, I think I should extract chromosome from here"
3748180,3750980," Right, it's gonna be like this"
3753140,3756660," Uh, and it's gonna be like this"
3756660,3760740," Uh-huh, uh-huh remove"
3760740,3764900," Why don't sodium drink tea anymore because I don't want to"
3764900,3767700," So why why is it that it boy is that important?"
3767700,3771940," Why is that important?"
3773540,3778500," All right, all right, uh, so this is not a pointer"
3778500,3782980," Cool, and uh, then"
3782980,3786420," We'll have to find the agent"
3789140,3790260," It's chromosome"
3790260,3793540," And then the corresponding genes"
3793540,3796180," And everything seems to work. So now"
3796180,3798180," Um, a chromosome"
3798180,3801060," A part of the"
3801060,3804340," Of the agents which is actually pretty cool"
3804340,3807060," Can we print chromo? Yeah, we do have a"
3807060,3812820," Chroma printing which is quite convenient. So if I go to print agent"
3813540,3816820," Um, I should be able to also"
3816820,3820020," Print its chromosomes, right?"
3820020,3822980," So let's see how it's gonna go"
3822980,3827940," Chroma"
3827940,3828340," equal"
3828340,3834020," And I wonder how exactly I'm gonna print that I think I'm gonna just go with a very stupid idea"
3834020,3836340," Where I'm gonna just print chromo"
3836340,3839300," Chroma agent"
3839300,3841060," Chroma"
3841060,3842740," And I think I have to provide the stream"
3843300,3845380," And do I have to provide it as a pointer?"
3845380,3847300," I think it would make sense to provide as a pointer"
3847300,3850660," This thing has to be const by the way because when you print something there's no"
3850660,3853620," Much sense to modify it, right?"
3853620,3855060," So let's actually keep it as const"
3855060,3858180," Let's just keep it as const"
3858180,3859140," Uh, all right"
3859140,3861700," So we're gonna let them leave for a while"
3861700,3864100," All right, we're gonna leave them uh, let them leave for a while"
3864100,3870500," Uh, that's what I'm gonna tell you looks at the cam with the look as if you said something stupid which might be true"
3873300,3875300," Uh"
3875300,3876900," Anyway"
3876900,3880020," Very funny"
3880020,3881540," So here we go"
3881540,3884820," So we have agents and we have their corresponding chromosomes"
3884820,3887140," So essentially the chromosome consists of the"
3887140,3889540," Uh, state of the agent"
3889540,3891940," What uh, it's supposed to see"
3892660,3893300," The action"
3893300,3896180," And uh, what it should switch to"
3896180,3898340," This is actually interesting if it's in state four"
3898340,3900980," And it sees agent in front of it"
3900980,3902180," It should turn left"
3902180,3904500," And stay in a state four"
3904500,3907620," Which is quite quite funny"
3908740,3913140," Basically it it when it sees the agent it should keep keep rotating and stuff like that"
3913140,3915540," So this is basically the chromosomes"
3915540,3917460," If anyone is interested"
3917460,3925620," Um, so yeah, and these are the best chromosomes that survived I suppose that survived for this amount of time"
3925620,3928500," Um"
3928500,3936100," You should start your magnesium level will thank you later best part is when you const miss clicking correct later"
3937620,3939620," Uh"
3939620,3940020," What?"
3940020,3941220," Okay"
3941220,3943860," Coffee is a type of tea"
3943860,3946500," All right"
3946500,3949700," We we have pretty controversial topic today"
3949700,3959380," Uh, okay, so, uh, let's continue let's continue. So, um, what we're working on is"
3959380,3962500," next generation next generation"
3965060,3967620," Uh-huh, so this is the next generation"
3967620,3974100," Okay"
3974100,3978100," Uh introduce"
3978100,3982420," Action to print top five"
3982420,3985300," Agents at the moment"
3985300,3988580," Right top five at the moment and we're gonna push that right into"
3989780,3996260," Hello here to nasa by the way hello everyone who just joined i'm sorry if i missed anyone welcome welcome welcome welcome really glad to see you all today"
3996260,3998420," So yeah"
3998420,4001220," Uh"
4001220,4006580," So we have print the best and what we need to do here is I think"
4006580,4010500," We need to"
4011140,4014420," I'm gonna actually make a pretty controversial uh function"
4014420,4021620," I think you're gonna like a chat it's a pretty controversial function"
4021620,4024100," mate agents"
4026420,4028420," Okay, so it takes uh"
4028420,4030500," Two agents"
4030500,4031380," Parent one"
4031380,4034980," And parent two"
4034980,4036500," Uh"
4036500,4038660," Right"
4038660,4041140," You see where i'm going with that"
4041140,4044660," Uh, right so and it also gets the child"
4045380,4046580," so"
4046580,4047380," Essentially"
4047380,4056020," What this function will do I know it's kind of monkey to us, but it's it is it is a part of the genetic algorithm"
4056020,4059220," Okay, it is a part of the genetic algorithm to mate"
4059220,4062500," Your solutions you you have two solutions"
4062500,4066180," Right and you have to make them into a new solution"
4066180,4067540," right"
4067540,4068580," Um"
4068580,4075940," So and what this thing will do it will take half of the chromosomes of the parent one half of the chromosomes of the parent two and"
4075940,4078660," Put them into the chromosomes of the child"
4078660,4086180," Right, and then we're gonna use this function to generate um to make a new generation of uh of agents"
4086180,4089300," um"
4089300,4098340," Uh, are there familiar? I don't think like uh, we're gonna actually associate any gender with the agents because I think"
4098340,4100660," Gender is not really relevant. What's relevant is"
4100660,4105940," Uh, we have to take half of the chromosomes from one parent and half of the chromosomes from another parent"
4105940,4108580," Like there is no reason to even have gender here"
4108580,4111220," Uh, right"
4111220,4128260," How it's controversial I don't understand well because this function is based basically makes"
4128340,4129940," Agents to fuck with each other"
4129940,4135220," Do I really have to explain all of my jokes? Thank you very much. All right, so uh"
4135220,4138100," Let's continue"
4138100,4138580," Um"
4138580,4141860," How are we gonna do all of that? Um"
4141860,4149860," I wonder if uh, so I think the parent one was is gonna define the first half of the chromosome and the parent two have to define"
4150740,4152740," The lower part of the chromosome"
4152740,4155620," um"
4155620,4159620," But you're supposed to talk about uh flowers and bees first and yeah"
4159620,4169220," Um, you know what to be able to split chromosomes in half"
4169620,4174820," I think the amount of genes in the chromosome has to be even number"
4174820,4176660," I think so"
4176660,4180900," And I think we have to enforce that at compile time. So we have genes count"
4180900,4185460," Right, so we have some static asserts. Uh, yeah, I think i'm gonna move"
4185460,4188100," Uh, this static assert"
4188740,4190740," Closer to the constants"
4190740,4194980," Right closer to the contest context of constants"
4194980,4198980," And i'm gonna just put it here"
4198980,4207700," Okay, so static assert and what we want to assert here is where the genes count genes count more the two equal to zero"
4209300,4211300," Uh, genes"
4211300,4212420," Amount"
4212420,4216500," Amount of genes in the chromosome"
4216500,4221140," Chromosome must be an even number"
4221140,4224900," For uh, the mating process"
4224900,4226980," Uh, to happen"
4226980,4230020," Uh, happen properly"
4230020,4235380," Um, yeah for meeting previously to happen properly"
4235380,4236980," Uh, so"
4238820,4240820," Um"
4240820,4247940," Yeah, so this is what we're gonna do here. So genes count"
4247940,4252820," Uh, it's 10 of them. So that means it should be relatively easy to just do all of that"
4252820,4259220," Uh, does mutation take place in your simulation? It does not, but it will uh, I just didn't implement it yet"
4259220,4261860," But we're gonna implement it soon"
4261860,4265220," So we're gonna mutate it in a very simple simple way"
4265220,4267700," So we're gonna have a separate function"
4268340,4270340," Um"
4270340,4276180," Which is called mutate agent, so it's gonna take only a single agent, right?"
4276180,4279700," And it's gonna basically flip"
4279700,4286340," one of the uh, genes of that agents, uh, with a low probability, right?"
4288500,4295620," Um, I think I wanna actually make it a separate function, so when we're gonna do the whole like a new generation, uh function"
4295620,4297460," We're gonna have like separate steps"
4297460,4300980," Mating the agents then mutating the child, right?"
4300980,4304500," Mating the agents mutating the child mating mutating mating mutating"
4305060,4308980," Um, I think it's like it's gonna be a little bit more readable in in in the end"
4308980,4312180," Uh, but this is just me, uh, but yeah"
4314180,4318340," So asserts um mutate agent"
4318340,4323700," Um to do the agent is not implemented"
4323700,4330500," There we go, there we go, um, mating mutating"
4330500,4335220," Um, all right"
4335220,4345380," So memcpy and we're gonna copy child chromo uh genes"
4346420,4352580," All right, so this is the destination, uh, from parent one chromo"
4352580,4354180," Uh genes"
4354180,4358660," And how, uh, how many genes we want to copy we're gonna we're gonna copy genes"
4359620,4364020," Uh genes count divided by two so you see we're copying half of the"
4364020,4366980," chromosome of the first parent, right?"
4366980,4370100," And then we'll have to copy, um"
4370100,4377060," The second part of the chromosome of the second parent and I suppose we'll have to do it like that"
4377060,4382180," Right, so it has to be plus half of the genes here again"
4388900,4390180," All right"
4390180,4391540," To be fair, I think that's it"
4391540,4393620," That's the whole mating process"
4393620,4399220," Seriously, like we take half of the chromosome of one parent half of the chromosome of the second parent and we merge them in the child"
4399220,4401220," That should be it"
4401220,4405540," Essentially, uh, but I mean, yeah, we'll probably have to add like half"
4405540,4408820," Here like that"
4408820,4413460," Yeah, maybe we also want to pre-compute this value, but maybe the compiler will optimize it properly"
4413460,4418340," Um, I don't know maybe it will optimize it properly"
4419140,4424260," Uh, but it would be actually kind of cool to have that for readability, right? Something like, um"
4424260,4427220," Length"
4427220,4429780," Um, yeah, let's call it length"
4430820,4437140," Uh, and we're gonna just simply replace it with with the length everywhere"
4437140,4439780," There we go. I think it's a little bit more readable"
4439780,4442580," Does it make sense? I think it makes sense"
4444180,4444980," Yeah"
4444980,4452980," Thank you. Thank you so much"
4452980,4458820," Alrighty, uh, so mutating agents well, uh, we just have to iterate through all of the"
4459940,4461780," Uh, through all of the genes"
4461780,4464420," of the, uh, an agent"
4464420,4470100," And with a certain probability, right? With a certain probability we have to"
4470100,4472660," generate like a new thing there"
4473780,4477460," Um, what programming language is it? This is C"
4477460,4480260," This is a pure C programming language"
4482900,4484660," Uh, to to the term"
4484660,4489620," So do we want to like like regenerate like the whole"
4489620,4490980," Gene"
4490980,4494180," Maybe it makes sense to try to regenerate the whole gene"
4494180,4496740," So one of the things we can do actually we can do a random"
4496740,4499940," Int range, right? Int range"
4499940,4503060," Do I even have that? Int range"
4503060,4507620," Random, I suppose it's a random"
4507620,4511460," Int range and it's going to be from 0 to 100"
4511460,4516980," Right, and if it's equal to 0, so it's a 1 in 100 chance"
4516980,4520900," For a for that particular gene to mutate"
4520900,4523700," Right for that particular gene to mutate"
4523700,4526900," And how do we generate this kind of stuff? So I can initialize the game"
4526900,4529860," Uh, so I just initialize the game"
4529860,4533700," And this is how I generate new chromosomes here, right?"
4533700,4536580," So, uh, I might as well actually do it in a similar way"
4536580,4540340," So i'm going to just regenerate the whole gene from scratch"
4540340,4542900," Uh, and that will mutate it"
4542900,4546740," Uh, that will mutate it"
4551940,4553860," Um, two, two, two, two, two"
4553860,4556820," Size of genes"
4556820,4558740," Uh, I have to go, I will follow and watch later"
4558740,4559300," Bye-bye"
4559300,4560100," See you around"
4560100,4560660," See you around"
4560660,4562340," Uh, okay"
4562340,4563620," Agents"
4563620,4564820," There we go"
4564820,4566660," And this one is a pointer, of course"
4566660,4568420," This one is a pointer"
4568980,4571460," So essentially we just generate a new state"
4571460,4572740," We generate a new environment"
4572740,4573860," Random action"
4573860,4574900," And so on and so forth"
4574900,4577940," And I think this has to be a probability of the gene"
4577940,4578980," And it has to be like a"
4578980,4581300," Um, a special command"
4581300,4583300," Mutation probability"
4583300,4585940," Right, but it's not really probability, right?"
4585940,4586420," It's a"
4587700,4588740," I don't know how to express"
4588740,4591140," Like explain what that thing is"
4591140,4591940," Right"
4591940,4593060," Let's go"
4593060,4594180," Let's actually call it proper"
4594180,4597220," Um"
4597220,4602180," So mutation"
4602180,4607380," Mutation probe"
4608180,4618820," And if it's 100"
4618820,4621060," That means there's 1 in 100 is chance"
4621060,4625940," So and that's why"
4625940,4629940," Let's call it chance"
4629940,4631380," Yeah, mutation chance"
4632500,4633860," I think it's a pretty good name"
4633860,4635780," So I'm gonna put all of that into"
4635780,4637780," Into here"
4637780,4638660," All right"
4638660,4640100," So here's the mutation chance"
4640100,4642340," And there we go"
4642340,4645940," Yeah, this is how a mutation is gonna work"
4645940,4647780," We have a particular mutation chance"
4647780,4651220," And then that mutates the gene"
4651220,4653620," Okay"
4662500,4665380," So this is a single agent"
4665380,4667940," Cool"
4667940,4671380," What I'm thinking about is that"
4671380,4673460," Okay, so we have a functions to perform"
4673460,4675140," This kind of"
4675140,4681940," This kind of optimization and stuff like that"
4681940,4682740," This kind of steps"
4682740,4685540," But how do we generate a new generation?"
4685540,4690740," This one is interesting"
4692500,4692820," um"
4692820,4698820," New generation"
4698820,4701140," So this is going to be the function"
4701140,4701940," Game.h"
4701940,4705780," Tournaments"
4705780,4711460," Make new generation"
4711460,4713300," So"
4713300,4716340," Old"
4716340,4718260," New"
4720420,4721220," What's called game"
4721220,4722580," A new game"
4722580,4723700," A new game"
4723700,4725780," So essentially we're going to have two games"
4725780,4726020," Right"
4726020,4727300," We're going to have two games"
4727300,4733220," We're going to have two games"
4733220,4733460," And"
4733460,4735060," I think also"
4735060,4737060," Old game should be modifiable"
4737060,4738180," What this thing will do"
4738180,4740660," It will find the best"
4740660,4745620," The best agents in the previous game"
4746900,4747140," Right"
4747140,4751300," Like best five agents of the of the previous game"
4751300,4753220," Use them to"
4753220,4755700," Basically mate with each other"
4755700,4755940," Right"
4755940,4757220," It will mate them with each other"
4757220,4760900," And then put them into the next game"
4760900,4761700," Right"
4761700,4764260," The next game is probably going to happen in a different environment"
4764260,4765940," But will it happen in a different environment?"
4765940,4768100," And should it happen in a different environment?"
4768100,4768900," I'm not quite sure"
4770420,4775300," As I remember you can get"
4775300,4776580," N of top survived"
4776580,4779700," And then feel left with crossing among all"
4779700,4784980," Okay"
4784980,4788180," So you can actually do different things differently"
4788180,4788340," Like"
4788340,4790660," And depending on how you do things"
4790660,4792980," You're going to produce like different results"
4793860,4794100," So"
4794100,4796900," I'm going to do it like that"
4796900,4798020," I'm going to just take"
4798020,4799300," Pick the best ones"
4799300,4800260," Right"
4800260,4802420," And mate them with each other"
4802420,4802820," Right"
4802820,4805140," Trying to produce like the best results"
4805140,4806180," And we'll see how it goes"
4806180,4811380," Good idea to give them the second chance"
4811380,4814340," Maybe I'm going to put it to do"
4814340,4814900," Because right now"
4814900,4816100," I just want to implement it"
4816100,4816820," Like as"
4816820,4818340," As I have it in my head"
4818340,4819220," All right"
4819220,4822900," Um"
4822900,4823940," All right"
4823940,4826660," Different"
4826660,4828020," More"
4828020,4828500," Different"
4828500,4830020," Mating"
4830020,4831860," Strategies"
4831860,4832420," Right"
4832420,4834100," So more different mating strategies"
4834100,4837780," All right"
4837780,4840500," Different strategies for"
4840500,4843220," Next generations"
4843940,4845060," For next generation"
4845060,4846420," Make next generation"
4846420,4848020," So this is how we're going to call this function"
4848020,4850100," For the same environment"
4850100,4850820," Food and all"
4850820,4852900," Generate the most fitting for such environment"
4852900,4855540," Okay"
4855540,4856420," So sounds good idea"
4856420,4858580," So that means we're going to copy the environment"
4858580,4860500," From one place to another one"
4860500,4861700," Uh"
4861700,4862340," Hello a good look"
4862340,4862740," Welcome"
4862740,4863780," Welcome to the stream"
4863780,4865860," We're already mating agents with each other"
4865860,4869380," Look at the signature of this function"
4869380,4870260," Just just look at it"
4870260,4871300," Look at it"
4873940,4877460," This is such a funny signature"
4877460,4878420," Like a parent one"
4878420,4878980," Parent two"
4878980,4879620," And the child"
4879620,4880260," And basically"
4880260,4882420," We take half of the chromosome"
4882420,4882980," Of the parents"
4882980,4884260," And put them into the child"
4884260,4885380," So that's what we're doing"
4885380,4886740," We've already implemented this function"
4886740,4887220," By the way"
4887220,4888580," So we're just"
4888580,4889620," We're really copying them"
4891140,4892980," We're really copying them"
4892980,4898100," I have seen lecture of Dave Churchill"
4898100,4899220," On Twitch a few years ago"
4899220,4901700," And he studied the subject of two students"
4901700,4902260," Well cool"
4902260,4903140," The thing is"
4903140,4905860," I didn't read anything about genetic algorithms"
4905860,4907220," So my idea is that"
4907220,4910500," I have the idea of genetic algorithm"
4910500,4912020," And I just want to implement it myself"
4912020,4913620," I just want to discover things myself"
4913620,4915060," I just want to experiment things myself"
4915060,4918260," And I don't want to watch other people talking about it"
4918260,4920260," Before I implement something myself"
4920260,4922020," Because it kind of ruins the fun for me"
4922020,4923780," Because I want to sort of explore that"
4923780,4925460," Yeah"
4925460,4928020," So the only thing I know about genetic programming"
4928020,4928500," It's"
4928500,4928900," Is"
4928900,4930020," Its description"
4930020,4930500," Right"
4930500,4931460," Its description"
4931460,4933060," And I'm going off of that"
4933060,4934100," So"
4934100,4940660," Sorry for not doing how you're supposed to do things"
4940660,4941540," How you were told"
4942100,4944340," Just like to do things my way"
4944340,4945140," I'm not super going"
4945140,4947220," But why we use this pattern of"
4947220,4947540," Pass"
4947540,4948740," Return"
4948740,4949780," AKA the child"
4949780,4950660," As a parameter"
4950660,4952340," Instead of returning a new child"
4952340,4953860," Passing"
4953860,4955780," Well"
4955780,4957540," Because it lets you"
4957540,4959620," Place the child"
4959620,4961860," In whatever place in the memory you want"
4961860,4962980," If you return the child"
4962980,4964020," You're doomed to"
4964020,4965700," Have the child on the stack"
4965700,4966980," But if you don't have it on the stack"
4966980,4967860," Or in a different place"
4967860,4970900," So it's not particularly convenient"
4970900,4973300," So it's rather better to have like a pointer"
4973300,4974020," Does it make sense?"
4974020,4980100," So"
4980100,4980340," Okay"
4980340,4983620," So for the previous game"
4983620,4984340," We'll have to"
4984340,4985700," Modify"
4985700,4987380," We'll have to"
4987380,4989220," Essentially"
4989220,4991620," Sort"
4991620,4993620," The agents first"
4993620,4994260," So there we go"
4994260,4995300," We're sorting the agents"
4996420,5003300," And now we need to have a constant"
5003300,5004100," For"
5004100,5009540," For how many we're going to take out of the"
5009540,5010980," Thing"
5010980,5011700," So I think"
5011700,5013620," Maybe we're going to call it like selection pool"
5013620,5014580," Right"
5014580,5015300," Or something like that"
5015300,5017140," I'm not sure if it's a like correct terminology"
5017140,5017700," Probably not"
5017700,5019540," Right"
5019540,5021220," Selection pool is going to be five"
5021220,5024100," So basically how many of them we pick out of the"
5024100,5026580," Out of the previous generation"
5026580,5026820," Right"
5026820,5028660," So"
5028660,5028980," And"
5028980,5031620," It's going to be something like size t"
5031620,5031860," I"
5031860,5033140," Actually"
5033140,5034340," Zero"
5034340,5036660," So selection"
5036660,5038740," Selection pool"
5038740,5040980," Then size t"
5040980,5041460," J"
5041460,5041860," Zero"
5041860,5043380," Selection pool"
5043380,5043940," Like that"
5043940,5044980," If I"
5044980,5046500," Actually"
5046500,5051540," I'm just thinking"
5051540,5064340," So I think the selection pool should be half of all the agents"
5064340,5064980," Right"
5064980,5065780," Maybe it has to be"
5065780,5066980," Maybe it's too much actually"
5066980,5072020," Maybe it's too much"
5074100,5076500," So if I'm going to half of the half of them"
5076500,5079060," The majority of them is going to still be Ppega"
5079060,5081060," So"
5081060,5090740," I'll have to keep doing that until I feel all of the agents unfortunately"
5098740,5099060," So"
5099060,5102100," Yeah"
5102100,5103940," Let's give it a try"
5103940,5105300," Okay"
5105300,5118820," I think I know what I'm going to do"
5118820,5119620," I'm going to do"
5119620,5121140," I'm going to do slightly different strategy"
5122580,5125300," Because I need to generate exactly"
5125300,5128180," Two thousand of the agents"
5128180,5129460," For the next generation"
5129460,5130420," That's what I need to do"
5130420,5132500," I need to generate exactly two thousands of them"
5132500,5133540," Right"
5133540,5136420," And I only select five of the best of them"
5136420,5137700," Right"
5137700,5138580," So that's the problem"
5138580,5139060," I need to"
5139060,5140020," Like I have five of them"
5140020,5141780," And I need to generate two thousands of them"
5141780,5146340," And"
5146340,5148740," So essentially what I'm going to do instead"
5148740,5149620," Right"
5149620,5150980," What I'm going to do instead"
5150980,5151220," Is"
5151220,5153220," Agents count"
5153220,5157300," So I'm going to iterate here"
5157300,5160420," And I'm going to pick a random out of the selection pool"
5160420,5160900," Right"
5160900,5161140," So"
5161140,5162660," It's going to be something like"
5162660,5165060," Random int range"
5165060,5167700," And I'm going to just select random out of the selection pool"
5167700,5167940," And"
5167940,5171380," So maybe it's going to be p1 and p2"
5171380,5174500," Like I select two random out of the selection pool"
5174500,5174740," And"
5174740,5177780," This is the ones that we're going to mate here"
5177780,5179300," Make sense?"
5179300,5179780," Make sense?"
5179780,5180580," Probably makes sense"
5180580,5181140," Okay"
5181140,5181380," Cool"
5181380,5182420," Okay, cool"
5188020,5188420," Hmm"
5188420,5188420," Hmm"
5188420,5190420," So"
5190420,5197300," Game.h"
5197300,5200580," Mate agents"
5200580,5204100," Mate agents"
5204100,5205940," So the parent one is going to be"
5205940,5206580," Which one?"
5206580,5207060," Game"
5207060,5208020," A previous game"
5216580,5219860," That moment I'm happy that I'm just a little C# developer"
5219860,5220100," Who"
5220100,5222820," Can just not care about memory management"
5222820,5224980," And throw all the responsibility on client"
5224980,5225300," Cool"
5225300,5227860," Agents"
5227860,5228580," P1"
5228580,5229780," So this is the first parent"
5229780,5234100," So the second one"
5234100,5236180," Is this one"
5236180,5237300," A previous game"
5237300,5239620," Agents P2"
5239620,5242420," And"
5242420,5244020," We're going to do next game"
5244020,5245220," Next game"
5246180,5247060," Agents"
5247060,5247460," Um"
5247460,5248420," I"
5248420,5249940," So we see"
5249940,5252100," You see what we're doing here?"
5252100,5252980," See what we're doing here?"
5252980,5254260," Um"
5254260,5255140," Yeah"
5255140,5255940," Previous games"
5255940,5256180," Like"
5256180,5256660," Rand"
5256660,5257380," Two random"
5257380,5258820," Parents"
5258820,5259940," Out of the selection pool"
5259940,5260900," And"
5260900,5262340," We add them to"
5262340,5263300," To the new agents"
5263300,5264180," And on top of that"
5264180,5264900," We want to"
5264900,5265540," Go ahead"
5265540,5266260," And mutate"
5266260,5267700," Uh"
5267700,5268740," Mutate that agent"
5268740,5269380," Afterwards"
5269380,5270500," So mutate agent"
5270500,5271540," Uh"
5271540,5272580," And"
5272580,5274580," Just put it like that"
5275460,5275780," Right"
5275780,5277220," There's a small chance of mutation"
5277220,5279860," So here are the two steps"
5279860,5280580," Of all of that"
5280580,5283940," The two steps of all of that"
5283940,5285380," Now"
5287380,5289700," How do we initialize the rest of the stuff?"
5289700,5292660," So we do that in the init game"
5292660,5297220," So what's funny is that"
5297220,5300340," We only do that for the chromosomes"
5300340,5305380," The next thing we have to do"
5305380,5305860," We have to"
5305860,5307460," Do this thing"
5308980,5310180," Now we have to do this thing"
5310180,5317060," So we mutated everything"
5317060,5317780," And"
5317780,5319860," In the new game"
5319860,5320740," In the next game"
5320740,5324660," The next game"
5324660,5326420," We're going to generate a new agent"
5326420,5327780," Like a completely new agent"
5327780,5329620," Uh"
5329620,5331220," And then for the foot"
5331220,5332260," Speaking of the foot"
5333940,5335060," Speaking of the foot"
5335060,5342420," I suppose I'm going to copy paste the food"
5342420,5344580," Yeah, I'm going to"
5344580,5346020," I'm going to simply copy paste the food"
5346020,5350420," So"
5350420,5351700," This is the"
5351700,5354020," Next game"
5354020,5358260," And this is"
5360180,5362020," The position from the previous game"
5362020,5371300," Similarly here"
5371300,5373540," I'm going to do this thing"
5373540,5373940," Like that"
5373940,5378820," Previous game"
5378820,5380980," Surprising enough"
5380980,5381540," I think"
5381540,5383140," One of the things I want to do"
5383140,5384340," Before doing anything else"
5384340,5385380," I want to memset"
5385380,5387380," The whole game"
5387380,5388020," To zero"
5390180,5392100," Right"
5392100,5393540," So it's zero initializes"
5393540,5393940," And"
5393940,5395940," Sort of makes sense"
5395940,5396260," All right"
5396260,5397940," So we have a next generation situation"
5397940,5402260," And we can try to use all of that"
5402260,5407700," Agent"
5407700,5412820," Has no member genes"
5412820,5414660," Really?"
5414660,5415540," Oh, because it's a"
5415540,5417700," It's a chromosome"
5419140,5419460," Yeah"
5419460,5420820," So I have to do something like"
5420820,5423300," Chromo"
5423300,5426580," Dot"
5426580,5428500," Okay"
5428500,5429460," Is it going to work now?"
5429460,5434900," Why did I put this thing here?"
5434900,5435700," I don't quite know"
5435700,5439620," All right"
5439620,5439860," So"
5439860,5444100," Previous game"
5444100,5445060," We're sorting everything"
5445060,5445780," No chromo"
5447780,5448900," When mating agents"
5448900,5450500," Don't forget to say no chromo"
5450500,5452260," Funny"
5452260,5452820," Funny"
5452820,5453700," All right"
5453700,5454900," All right"
5454900,5455700," So"
5455700,5459300," Cool"
5459300,5462980," Now I need to call this function"
5462980,5465220," Somewhere here"
5465220,5467140," But here's the thing"
5467140,5468500," I need to"
5468500,5471220," Have two games"
5471220,5472340," Right"
5472340,5473700," So I need to have two games"
5473700,5474660," The previous game"
5474660,5474660," The previous game"
5474660,5475060," And the"
5475060,5476420," The next game"
5476420,5479380," I'm a comedic genius"
5479380,5480420," Yeah"
5480420,5480820," You are"
5480820,5485220," Init"
5485220,5486020," Game"
5486020,5486900," So and this is where"
5486900,5488660," Actually we want to do a mem set as well"
5488660,5489780," So it's going to be game"
5489780,5490260," Zero"
5490260,5490740," Size"
5490740,5498340," So we're just going here"
5498340,5498980," As usual"
5498980,5503300," Until everyone dies"
5503300,5504420," And yeah"
5504420,5509860," Let's go back to"
5509860,5511940," Here"
5511940,5512260," Maybe"
5517460,5517860," Main"
5517860,5519700," Yeah"
5519700,5520660," So we're going to have games"
5520660,5522580," We're going to have two of them"
5522580,5524820," All of them are zero initialized"
5524820,5525460," And stuff like that"
5525460,5526580," So"
5526580,5527140," And essentially"
5527140,5528980," We're going to keep track of the current game"
5528980,5533700," So we're going to go with the current"
5533700,5534820," The current one is zero"
5534820,5536420," So essentially"
5536420,5538100," We're going to just flip-flop between them"
5538100,5542900," As we generate new things here"
5543860,5545060," And we'll see how it goes"
5545060,5547460," So we're initializing"
5547460,5550020," Actually the current game"
5550020,5550740," So it's going to be"
5550740,5554020," Games current"
5554020,5554900," So there we go"
5554900,5556580," So this is what we're initializing there"
5556580,5559300," Games current"
5559300,5559620," And"
5559620,5560740," Boom"
5560740,5563060," When we're stepping the game"
5563060,5564580," We're stepping actually the current game"
5564580,5568660," And when we're doing this thing"
5568660,5571620," We're actually re-initializing the current game as well"
5572340,5572980," All right"
5572980,5573220," So"
5573220,5575540," It's supposed to be called games"
5575540,5577700," It's supposed to be called games"
5577700,5579060," Okay"
5579060,5579620," So when"
5579620,5582180," I'm mating the agents"
5582180,5582420," Right"
5582420,5583700," When I'm mating the agents"
5583700,5585140," What am I doing"
5585140,5588500," So"
5588500,5590500," I need to have something like next"
5590500,5593220," And the next is essentially one minus current"
5593220,5594740," Does anybody recognize this pattern?"
5594740,5597220," Does anybody recognize this pattern?"
5597220,5598980," So"
5598980,5600340," It's actually a pretty useful pattern"
5600340,5601300," If you don't know about it"
5601300,5602260," I really recommend you"
5602260,5602660," Like"
5602660,5604020," Because you're competitive programmer"
5604020,5605220," You know what it is"
5605220,5607700," But essentially flip-flopping between zero and one"
5607700,5611380," So essentially if a current is zero"
5611380,5612500," The result is going to be one"
5612500,5613700," Right"
5613700,5614820," So"
5614820,5615460," And"
5615460,5616500," If the current is one"
5616500,5618260," The result is going to be zero"
5618260,5619940," So basically this pattern"
5619940,5622580," Let's just flip-flop between zero and one"
5622580,5624020," It's actually very useful"
5624020,5625940," And this is exactly what we're going to do here"
5626580,5626900," So"
5626900,5628340," And essentially we have a function"
5628340,5630980," That makes it the next generation"
5630980,5631220," Right"
5631220,5632100," And"
5632100,5634580," We take the previous game"
5634580,5635620," Which is game current"
5635620,5637380," Game current"
5637380,5639380," And then we generate the next game"
5643220,5647220," And after that we generated the next generation"
5647220,5648980," So the current is going to be next"
5648980,5649380," There we go"
5649380,5650180," So"
5650180,5651540," Isn't it cool?"
5651540,5652100," Isn't it cool?"
5652100,5652900," I think it's pretty cool"
5652900,5654420," So"
5654420,5654740," Yeah"
5655300,5659300," And that lets us to flip-flop between the game areas"
5659300,5659620," Right"
5659620,5660020," Without"
5660020,5661060," You know"
5661060,5665860," Without too much memory management"
5665860,5666180," Right"
5666180,5667300," Yeah"
5667300,5669140," It's actually kind of like a double buffering"
5669140,5670900," It's very close to double buffering"
5670900,5671700," So"
5671700,5672900," Yeah"
5672900,5673620," That's what it is"
5673620,5676580," Since like I'm using C"
5676580,5679060," Memory management is kind of like an ass"
5679060,5680260," So what I'm trying to do here"
5680260,5682260," Is to not use dynamic memory"
5682260,5684420," Because it makes everything difficult"
5684420,5686100," And I think I was pretty successful with that"
5686100,5687940," I don't have a single malloc here"
5687940,5688420," This is a"
5688420,5689860," Puracy"
5689860,5692020," And there's no single malloc here"
5692020,5693380," So all of this static memory"
5693380,5695700," That is required by the entire thing"
5695700,5696340," Is here"
5696340,5697700," Here it is"
5697700,5698740," There's nothing else"
5698740,5698900," Like"
5698900,5699860," Yeah"
5699860,5701780," So that's the whole buffer that we need"
5701780,5705780," And it just contains everything that we'll ever need"
5705780,5707940," All right"
5707940,5709380," So if I try to compile that"
5709380,5711300," So this is supposed to be called games"
5711300,5711620," And"
5711620,5713140," There we go"
5714420,5717460," So and"
5717460,5719220," When I click on the"
5719220,5720420," Okay so that has to be"
5720420,5721620," Current"
5721620,5726660," So and then we're rendering the game"
5726660,5728660," It's also current"
5728660,5730580," All right"
5731140,5734500," So I think we're ready to try things out"
5734500,5738260," We'll let them leave for some time"
5738260,5740660," Until majority of them die"
5740660,5744180," Until majority of them die"
5744180,5745940," And"
5746820,5747940," I think everyone is dead"
5747940,5748740," So I'm gonna"
5748740,5750500," I'm about to press N"
5750500,5751940," To generate a new generation"
5751940,5752980," To make a new generation"
5752980,5754740," Okay"
5754740,5756500," Oh"
5756500,5757140," Shit okay"
5757140,5758900," Here's an interesting thing"
5758900,5761060," Some of them got generated on"
5763540,5764500," On the food"
5764500,5764500," On the food"
5764500,5765620," And this is because we took"
5765620,5768500," The food from the previous step"
5768500,5768900," Okay"
5768900,5771700," So I think it should be super easy to fix"
5771700,5772980," Essentially"
5772980,5775940," Essentially"
5775940,5780260," Before trying to generate the agents"
5780260,5782900," We are copying food"
5782900,5785300," Copying food and walls"
5785300,5787780," So they take place in the game"
5787780,5791460," So the random empty coordinate on the board"
5791460,5793300," Will actually give you correct coordinates"
5793300,5795620," I think that should work now"
5796580,5797380," All right"
5797380,5798420," So we let them leave"
5798420,5800420," Until some of them die"
5800420,5805060," All right"
5805060,5807700," And we are about to"
5807700,5809540," Generate a new generation"
5809540,5811220," And as you can see"
5811220,5813140," None of them generated on top of the walls"
5813140,5814500," Or anything else"
5814500,5814740," And"
5814740,5817140," So this is a new generation"
5817140,5820420," With the top five survived agents"
5820420,5822820," Top five survived agents"
5822820,5824580," And also different mutations"
5824580,5826820," So this generation should perform"
5826820,5827700," Way better"
5827700,5829060," It should be more active"
5829060,5830260," It should try eat the food"
5830260,5831300," And let's see what's going to happen"
5831300,5835380," And none of them are doing anything"
5835380,5838020," Uh"
5838020,5839860," Are they going to die?"
5839860,5843140," What the fuck?"
5843140,5844900," That's actually a strange"
5844900,5849300," Pepegas just died"
5849300,5851540," All right"
5854100,5854740," Okay cool"
5854740,5854740," Okay cool"
5854740,5856100," So what's the"
5856100,5857780," Takes a lot of"
5857780,5858900," Takes lots"
5858900,5860740," Lots of generations"
5860740,5863620," Natural seduction in a nutshell"
5863620,5864340," Yeah sure"
5864340,5866660," So I'm kind of like curious"
5866660,5867380," What does it do"
5867380,5870340," In terms of the initial state?"
5870340,5871540," What's the initial state?"
5871540,5877380," So for the agent"
5877380,5879700," Initial state seems to be always zero"
5879700,5891300," Initial state seems to be zero"
5891300,5894340," So what if we actually"
5894340,5897940," Try to increase the size of the"
5897940,5899620," Of the chromosomes"
5899620,5904180," And maybe the amount of states as well"
5904180,5906260," So they just start doing something more interesting"
5906260,5910900," Maybe also increase the selection pool"
5910900,5913940," Mutation chains"
5913940,5914900," State count"
5914900,5915220," Okay"
5915220,5919460," Genes count"
5919460,5920580," Let's actually make it 20"
5920580,5922100," States count"
5922100,5924340," States count"
5924340,5925540," Let's make them"
5925540,5926900," Seven"
5926900,5928660," I don't really want to make too many states"
5928660,5930660," So maybe seven"
5930660,5933220," Is more than enough"
5933220,5933540," All right"
5933540,5935300," Let's give it a try"
5935300,5937860," Okay"
5937860,5938740," They're doing things"
5938740,5941300," They're doing things"
5941300,5941860," Hopefully"
5941860,5948980," Some of them maybe even survived"
5948980,5950340," So this is how many survived"
5950340,5951460," We can clearly see them"
5951460,5955380," And then they stopped"
5955380,5956820," We're generating a new generation"
5956820,5964660," Okay"
5964660,5977380," The next one"
5977380,5984180," They're becoming more"
5984180,5985700," Pepego in Pepego to be fair"
5985700,5989380," So they're just staying"
5989380,5991540," And doing nothing"
5994660,6002500," Yeah"
6002500,6004820," All right"
6004820,6005140," So"
6005140,6010180," Let's actually commit"
6010180,6011220," Whatever we have here"
6011220,6012180," Because we already have"
6012180,6013780," Some sort of a mating algorithm"
6013780,6014420," Do we?"
6014420,6016820," Is this good?"
6016820,6018340," It's not actually really good"
6018340,6019140," But it's"
6019140,6020100," They're not doing anything"
6022260,6024820," How many agents do you regenerate randomly?"
6024820,6026660," I don't regenerate anyone randomly"
6026660,6027060," I just"
6027060,6029700," Use the top five"
6029700,6031220," But maybe"
6031220,6032580," Yeah"
6032580,6038340," Maybe I'm Pepego too"
6038340,6039700," But what are jeans?"
6039700,6040820," You mean jeans?"
6040820,6041780," It's a joke"
6041780,6042020," Yes"
6046660,6048420," It's a joke indeed"
6048420,6049540," All right"
6049540,6050580," So let's actually commit"
6050580,6051460," Whatever we have here"
6051460,6060180," Because that's"
6060180,6062420," It's actually pretty good"
6062420,6071220," Seduction pools start larger than smaller"
6071220,6072020," But we'll see"
6072020,6073540," We'll try to gather some ideas"
6073540,6074740," On how to fix that"
6074740,6075700," So"
6075700,6078020," Oh by the way"
6078020,6079300," Let me also"
6079300,6080820," Do this thing"
6080820,6081620," So we introduce"
6081620,6082740," Generate"
6082740,6085380," Completely"
6085380,6087540," Completely new state of the game"
6087540,6088500," All right"
6088500,6091860," Out9"
6091860,6092420," Hello"
6092420,6093700," Welcome to the stream"
6093700,6094260," Welcome"
6094260,6094660," Welcome"
6094660,6095220," Welcome"
6095220,6096740," How are we doing?"
6096740,6098340," Welcome"
6098340,6098580," Welcome"
6098580,6099780," So"
6099780,6102340," What we're doing right now"
6102340,6103780," We're mating agents"
6103780,6104420," So"
6104420,6105460," They're making babies"
6105460,6108420," So it's going to be"
6108420,6108580," N"
6108580,6111300," KBD"
6111300,6115780," Make a new generation"
6115780,6116740," Based"
6116740,6118820," On the best"
6118820,6120500," Performing"
6120500,6122020," Agents"
6122020,6123060," There we go"
6125620,6125940," So"
6125940,6126900," Essentially"
6126900,6127860," We have a function"
6127860,6128820," Called"
6128820,6129220," Mate"
6129220,6130100," Agents"
6130100,6130340," Right"
6130340,6131460," That"
6131460,6132180," Take"
6132180,6133380," Parent 1"
6133380,6134180," And parent 2"
6134180,6134900," And a child"
6134900,6135140," So"
6135140,6135620," And essentially"
6135620,6136740," What this thing does"
6136740,6137940," It takes half of the"
6137940,6139300," Chromosome of the parent 1"
6139300,6141140," And half of the chromosome of parent 2"
6141140,6142420," And puts it into the child"
6142420,6143780," So this is basically what we have"
6143780,6145140," And also we have a mutation step"
6145140,6146580," And"
6146580,6146820," Yeah"
6146820,6147700," So"
6147700,6148500," Right now"
6148500,6150420," The strategy is actually pretty dumb"
6150420,6151460," So"
6151460,6152020," We're going"
6152020,6153860," We're just generating agents"
6153860,6155620," We pick up random"
6155620,6157460," Like top parents"
6157460,6160100," And we're mating them"
6160100,6162100," And just generating new agents"
6162100,6163380," And it doesn't work by the way"
6163380,6165380," It doesn't work"
6165380,6166740," We're trying to figure out why"
6166740,6169140," We're trying to figure out why"
6169140,6171380," All right"
6171380,6172900," So let's actually do a committee committee"
6172900,6174900," And then the problem is that"
6174900,6177460," They get one more chromosome that need it"
6178420,6179380," I don't think so"
6179380,6179940," Because they"
6179940,6182180," I mean"
6182180,6182420," Yeah"
6182420,6186660," The size of the chromosome is actually fixed"
6186660,6186980," Right"
6186980,6187460," So"
6187460,6189140," And it's fixed in memory"
6189140,6190020," So it doesn't grow"
6190020,6190900," It doesn't shrink"
6190900,6192020," So it's always the same"
6192980,6193620," It was a joke"
6193620,6194180," I'm sorry"
6194180,6198580," I'm actually worried that it's not going to work out"
6198580,6199620," All right"
6199620,6201060," So"
6201060,6201700," Introduce"
6201700,6203860," An action"
6203860,6205540," To make a new"
6205540,6207300," Generation"
6207300,6208500," Based"
6208500,6209300," Yeah"
6209300,6210580," Let's make a new generation"
6210580,6210820," And"
6210820,6213060," Let me go to the master"
6213060,6214100," And actually"
6214100,6215380," Merge"
6215380,6216580," Without any fast forwarding"
6216580,6220660," So I don't have any pull requests right now"
6220660,6223460," So I'm sort of emulating pull requests locally"
6223460,6226420," Yeah"
6226420,6227460," I attributed you"
6227460,6228260," You attributed me"
6228260,6228580," I see"
6228580,6229940," All right"
6229940,6230980," Let's push the master"
6230980,6238100," So"
6238100,6239700," What I want to do right now"
6239700,6241620," I want to make a small break"
6241620,6243220," Because I need to refill my water"
6243220,6244340," I need to pee"
6244340,6245460," And I also need to"
6245460,6248020," Think"
6248020,6248660," A little bit"
6248660,6251140," On how to move forward"
6251140,6252420," Because it's kind of interesting"
6252420,6252660," Why"
6252660,6254900," It just doesn't work"
6254900,6258340," Parents do not survive"
6258340,6259300," It is sad"
6259300,6260180," It is sad"
6260180,6261060," But I think it's also"
6261060,6263220," Important from"
6263220,6264660," What state they're starting"
6264660,6270420," Parents are less prepared"
6270420,6270580," Yeah"
6270580,6270580," Yeah"
6270580,6271140," For some reason"
6271140,6271940," Parents are"
6271940,6273060," Like really less prepared"
6273060,6274740," I would have thought"
6274740,6277380," Um"
6277380,6279060," All right"
6279060,6280420," So"
6280420,6282180," Let's make a small break"
6282180,6282820," First girls"
6282820,6283780," Let's make a small break"
6283780,6284980," And you guys have fun"
6284980,6314960," Thank you."
6314980,6344960," Thank you."
6344980,6374960," Thank you."
6374980,6404960," Thank you."
6404980,6434960," Thank you."
6434980,6464960," Thank you."
6465660,6467020," Welcome back, everyone."
6467020,6468680," So let's continue."
6468680,6478160," What I was thinking about, maybe we do really need to have more generations and stuff like that, maybe like thousands or several thousands."
6479000,6484660," So, and because of that, we probably have to do that in a more like less interactive manner, right?"
6484660,6489280," So maybe we need to write a program that takes the initial state, right?"
6489340,6503160," The initial state of the game performs like, you know, several thousands of the generation and speeds out the resulting state afterwards, right?"
6503160,6509040," So, and maybe to facilitate that, we're going to have two separate applications."
6509040,6512880," The first application will perform the training and stuff like that."
6512880,6517420," And the second one is going to perform the simulation and visualization."
6517420,6520540," So, yeah, we're going to have two executables."
6521120,6534500," But to actually transfer information between the training application and the visualizing application, we need to be able to dump the state of the game and load it up."
6534500,6539380," So we need to come up with some sort of a format to do all of that."
6539380,6542220," It's kind of, it's kind of interesting."
6542220,6545680," So, I think this is what we're going to work towards."
6545680,6557000," And once we have like a training application that can train for thousands of generations, maybe we can try to troubleshoot that and see how we can make the training faster and stuff like that."
6557000,6561020," Because training manually is actually kind of like tedious, maybe it doesn't make any sense."
6561020,6564400," What if we want to create the training time-lapse in the future?"
6564400,6568620," Well, I mean, for that we can have like a separate application."
6568620,6580760," We can have a flag that the training application will just save all of the previous states and then it will speed out the time-lapse for you."
6580760,6583220," I don't understand why that could be a problem."
6583220,6584280," So, I don't think it's a problem."
6587000,6589480," So, yeah."
6589480,6597840," So, first of all, I think we need to be able to dump the state of the game."
6597840,6601560," We need to be able to dump the state of the game."
6601560,6608920," Unfortunately, that format like greatly depends on the values that we had coded in the game itself."
6608920,6610080," Right?"
6610080,6612780," Because we have such things as..."
6612780,6614780," What's your micro?"
6614780,6616420," Is it some..."
6616420,6616840," What?"
6617000,6617780," What is micro?"
6617780,6618800," I don't understand."
6618800,6619340," Excuse me."
6619340,6624760," Basically, we can make an app for everything if we can dump the right data."
6624760,6625400," Yeah, sure."
6625400,6627820," Microphone, I mean."
6627820,6630080," Check out my FAQ."
6630080,6633440," All of the answers are..."
6633440,6635020," All of the questions are answered in FAQ."
6635020,6635420," Thank you."
6639280,6639880," So, yeah."
6639880,6639880," So, yeah."
6639880,6639880," So, yeah."
6639880,6646740," It all greatly depends on the agents, foots, amount of walls, amount of jeans, and stuff like that."
6646740,6653880," So, and a file dumped by the application with these parameters is not going to be compatible with other parameters."
6654440,6659760," So, maybe all of these things have to become dynamic somehow."
6659760,6662040," But, yeah."
6662040,6662700," We'll see."
6662700,6666940," Food hunger recovery."
6670240,6671740," Yeah, maybe it has to be..."
6671740,6678200," All of that has to be like a part of the game, like part of the state of the game to actually properly work."
6678200,6679400," Hmm."
6679800,6680620," That's very interesting."
6680620,6686600," But that's a lot of additional work."
6686600,6688500," But maybe that's exactly what we want to do here."
6688500,6696460," Or maybe we're going to actually stick for now, at least, with these parameters."
6696460,6701220," And then we can implement something later that, you know, performs better."
6701220,6701920," Or not."
6701920,6705620," So, all right."
6705620,6708320," Let's implement a function called dump game."
6708700,6708900," All right."
6708900,6710040," So, we're going to provide the game."
6710040,6712020," We don't need to modify the game, for sure."
6712020,6713720," Right."
6713720,6719100," So, and we're going to accept the stream where exactly you want to dump this game."
6719100,6722180," So, two, two, two."
6722180,6725500," Init game."
6725500,6726620," There we go."
6726620,6730520," So, we're dumping the game."
6730520,6733640," And how exactly are we going to dump the game?"
6733640,6738600," Well, we can try to first dump."
6738600,6749340," The agents, right?"
6749340,6750500," So, it's going to be a game."
6750500,6752700," So, we need to dump the agents."
6752700,6761140," If you want to dump a single agent, we'll have to dump its current position, its directory, hunger."
6761800,6762480," Wait a second."
6762480,6764380," Can we just dump a binary there?"
6764380,6767180," Just take the game and dump a binary."
6767180,6768880," Like, seriously."
6768880,6770920," F, right?"
6770920,6773800," I mean, I think it's going to be the easiest way to do that."
6773800,6776160," Like, you don't even need any fucking format."
6776160,6777080," Just dump."
6777580,6782060," But the problem here is that you won't be able to read it outside, right?"
6782060,6786620," You won't be able to read it outside, but it's the easiest thing to do in C, right?"
6786960,6792560," So, the size is the size of the game here."
6792560,6795520," And you want to save a single thing here to the stream."
6795520,6797380," All right."
6797920,6802880," And read, if I remember correctly, it can fail in some particular situations."
6802880,6807860," The stand distinguish, yeah, you have to do like fError of some sort."
6808820,6817660," So, if fErrorStream, okay, we can crash somebody here."
6817660,6828080," So, I'm just thinking maybe it would be better to return the error somehow, indication of an error."
6828080,6829280," Right."
6829460,6832440," So, you can check whether it failed outside."
6832440,6836060," But I'm not sure if it makes that much sense to do it."
6836060,6837660," Like, yeah, let's actually check it here."
6837660,6844960," If error, we're going to do printf, std, fprintf, I mean, fprintf, std error."
6844960,6848340," Could not save."
6848340,6849440," Oh, yeah."
6849440,6852700," And this is why you want to do that outside, because you don't have a file path."
6852700,6853140," Right."
6853140,6854100," You only have a stream."
6854100,6855720," Right."
6855720,6858740," So, that's why you want to do it like that."
6859460,6859860," Yeah."
6859860,6865620," So, it's going to be return that and just int."
6865620,6867840," Let me take a look at f."
6867840,6869520," Yeah, fwrite."
6869520,6870400," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
6870400,6871280," It has to be fwrite."
6871280,6878720," fError and fError is like this."
6878720,6880340," Cool."
6880340,6883620," Do I have this as a part of the interface of the game itself?"
6883620,6884240," Dump."
6884240,6885240," Yeah, there we go."
6885240,6886360," And it has to return integer."
6886360,6889340," It has to return the integer."
6889460,6892180," And we are ready to go."
6892180,6893860," So, I'm going to go to the main."
6893860,6900380," And in the main, I'm going to have like a key that saves the state somewhere."
6900380,6903540," As the okay, let's call it D for dump."
6903540,6904260," Right."
6904300,6907160," We're going to take a huge dump and dump everything."
6907160,6912620," So, dump the game and we're going to just dump the current state of the game."
6912620,6917140," So, we're just dumping the current state of the game."
6923640,6930100," So, maybe I'm also going to print something."
6930100,6932300," Where are we going to dump them?"
6932300,6934980," So, file."
6934980,6937820," Dump file."
6938860,6953800," If this thing is equal to no."
6953800,6956760," It's going to be something around like game binary."
6956760,6967720," If this thing is equal to no."
6967720,6971240," We're going to say, could not open the file."
6973400,6974120," STD error."
6974120,6980440," Could not open S file."
6980440,6983120," Dump file path."
6983120,6984500," Dump file path."
6984500,6989180," So, exit one."
6992620,6996000," After that, I'm dumping this file into here."
6996000,6999300," And then, if."
6999300,7003300," F error."
7003300,7004740," What is F error return?"
7004740,7007160," What is the return?"
7007160,7012220," Where is the return section?"
7012220,7013060," I don't understand."
7013060,7013520," Okay."
7013520,7015760," So, I probably have to read about this function then."
7015760,7019560," Test the error pointer."
7019560,7022600," The error indicator we set on the test."
7022620,7023640," It's the error indicator."
7023640,7025400," But it doesn't say, what does it return?"
7025400,7027080," So, maybe I'm blind."
7027080,7030040," But I'm going to assume that if it returns something."
7030040,7031980," If it's not zero, that means something went wrong."
7031980,7033660," So, if that."
7033660,7036760," Could not."
7036760,7041400," Dump file."
7041400,7043780," And then, we're going to close this entire thing."
7043780,7047080," Then, we're going to close this entire thing."
7047080,7048460," So, here's a dump file."
7048460,7051220," Dump file."
7051800,7053380," And I'm going to do printf."
7053380,7056820," Dumped."
7056820,7058580," Dumped."
7058580,7059460," Why do I?"
7059460,7061660," Current state."
7061660,7062200," 2."
7062200,7064240," S."
7064240,7066380," Dump file path."
7075820,7076820," Dumped current state."
7076820,7078500," Dumped current state."
7078500,7083740," All right."
7083740,7087020," So, if open to few arguments."
7087020,7089740," We're going to open it with writing binary."
7089740,7091420," All right."
7091420,7093460," So, and now, if I press D."
7093460,7097160," It dumped the current state to the game.bin."
7097840,7100480," And it's actually a pretty big state, as you can see."
7100480,7100880," Right."
7100880,7102980," 716 kilobytes."
7102980,7108440," And it contains the current state of the game that you can try to load up."
7109180,7121000," And we can write a simple application that actually, you know, does the training for several generations and so on and so forth."
7121100,7125380," And dumps, like, the resulting, the resulting thing."
7130380,7132420," So, you know what?"
7132420,7142060," Let's actually write that training thing as part of this application, but in a separate way."
7142060,7144580," And we're going to switch between them as needed."
7144580,7145680," Does it make sense?"
7145680,7146480," Does it make sense?"
7147180,7152960," So, this one is probably not going to use any SDL."
7152960,7155720," So, it's going to be purely, like, offline thingy."
7155720,7161120," Once it's done, we can probably separate them to different binaries."
7161120,7162240," I think it will make sense."
7162240,7165320," So, dump game."
7165320,7167920," And another thing I want to have is load game."
7167920,7168500," Right."
7168500,7172660," So, we're going to have a stream and a pointer to the game."
7172660,7173360," Right."
7173360,7173780," There we go."
7174300,7177560," So, we need to learn how to load the game."
7177560,7180920," And loading the game should be actually similar to dump in the game."
7180920,7181860," Right."
7181860,7185280," It's just instead of fwrite, we have to use fread."
7185280,7185940," Right."
7185940,7187460," Simple as that."
7187460,7189340," Simple as that."
7189340,7192740," And essentially, yeah, we just do that."
7192740,7200340," But the problem here is that fread may actually read a different amount of character than the size of the game."
7200340,7207440," So, what we have to do here is assert that the amount of characters we read is equal to the size of the game here."
7207440,7213080," And that may happen if we change some of the parameters of the game that we hardcoded and stuff like that."
7213080,7215100," But in the future, we're going to unhardcode them."
7215100,7217440," But for now, we're going to just do these kind of measures."
7217440,7219680," Yeah."
7220840,7221240," Okay."
7221240,7224280," So, we have a load of the game and it seems to be working."
7224280,7225820," It seems to be at working."
7225820,7229220," So, dump file path."
7229220,7230900," I'm going to actually put it here."
7230900,7232540," Right."
7232540,7234600," So, we can reuse it in other places."
7238100,7239900," All righty, all righty, all righty, all righty."
7239900,7241960," So, f open."
7241960,7245780," To be fair, why the fuck am I passing stream there?"
7245780,7252640," Why am I passing stream there if I could have just passed the file paths?"
7252640,7254800," It kind of doesn't make any sense."
7254800,7258600," Like, just pass the file paths there because, yeah."
7258600,7261880," Oh my God, I'm such a big beggar."
7262160,7265340," Like, it would simplify fucking everything."
7265340,7267360," Like, just put a path there."
7267360,7271800," Yeah."
7271800,7273700," It's going to be file path."
7273700,7284540," And those functions are going to be responsible for opening the file, closing the file, and do all of this nasty shit for you."
7284540,7284920," Yeah."
7284920,7286380," That makes sense."
7286380,7288800," That makes sense."
7288800,7290060," That makes sense."
7290060,7291940," So, let's put them here."
7292600,7295340," So, and we're going to put this thing here."
7295340,7296400," Remember that."
7296400,7297660," Remember that."
7297660,7299380," All right."
7299380,7303160," So, f open file path."
7303160,7305260," Write binary."
7305260,7308460," If f equal null."
7308460,7313500," Print f std error."
7313500,7317340," Could not open file."
7317340,7320340," Hello, free file."
7320340,7321200," Welcome to the stream."
7321340,7322300," Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome."
7322300,7325840," You're not really too late."
7325840,7331020," We already implemented the, like, mating strategies and stuff like that, but none of them work."
7331020,7332700," So, don't worry about it."
7332700,7340860," You didn't really miss any epic moments when suddenly we had, like, super computer agents that can, like, destroy everyone."
7342020,7342500," Yeah."
7342500,7345940," All of them are ppega, even after several generations."
7345940,7349780," They actually, they actually, they actually degradate over several generations."
7349780,7351080," So, I don't think they're improving."
7351080,7353880," So, we're definitely not doing something right."
7353880,7356480," But, we'll see."
7357480,7357920," Okay."
7357920,7359240," So, here's the f write."
7359240,7363960," And, what we're doing here, we're saving the game into the stream."
7363960,7366120," I should have actually called this thing stream."
7366120,7366700," Too real."
7366700,7366980," Yeah."
7367060,7370080," It's almost like we're emulating, like, a real life, right?"
7370080,7372480," The generations are degradating."
7374600,7375340," All right."
7375340,7379580," So, and if this thing have failed."
7379580,7391700," Nutrient mutations are bad more than good."
7391700,7396340," Well, we don't really know the reason why this thing doesn't work yet."
7396340,7401720," Could not dump to file this."
7401720,7404560," And, after that, we have to close this."
7404600,7405500," File, of course."
7405500,7408660," Here's a suggestion."
7408660,7411380," Add a role to the Discord server called Announcement."
7411380,7413880," And, basically, ping Announcement every time you stream."
7413880,7416060," So, the people get notified."
7416060,7417920," I personally follow a lot of people on Twitch."
7417920,7419420," So, that's lost."
7419420,7420680," Oh, okay."
7420680,7422480," I see."
7422480,7425440," So, and essentially make a bot, right?"
7425440,7427840," That assigns these roles when people want to."
7427840,7430560," I think we already have that mechanism in KGBotko."
7430560,7432000," I'll think about that."
7432000,7432480," Thank you."
7432480,7433020," Thank you so much."
7433020,7434120," I think it's a pretty good suggestion."
7434600,7436880," Announcements role."
7436880,7437880," Yeah."
7437880,7442800," Default Twitch phone notification."
7442800,7444320," Yeah."
7444320,7449220," So, essentially how, like, similar to how we did, like, with Potato and PHP role."
7449220,7449980," Right."
7450060,7452740," So, basically, you click to get an announcement role."
7452740,7454620," But, yeah."
7454620,7456920," It just means all channels accept announcements."
7456920,7457660," Ah, I see."
7457660,7458340," Yeah."
7458340,7461460," I'm using an overlay camera because I think it has, like, a better FPS."
7462460,7463080," I don't know."
7463080,7465900," Can you see it's just, like, better FPS than in player."
7465900,7468360," So, yeah."
7468360,7469800," I decided to start using it."
7469800,7471660," Does it look better?"
7471660,7472280," I'm not sure."
7472280,7479920," I actually had to slightly decrease the quality of that web camera because it was consuming too much resources on my laptop."
7480600,7483080," So, like, it was running at full HD."
7483080,7488520," Now, I think it's 760p, I think."
7492520,7493540," Looks like 30 FPS."
7493540,7493860," Yes."
7493860,7497280," So, before, I think it was less than 30 FPS."
7497280,7500200," So, this makes it smoother."
7500200,7501260," I don't know."
7501260,7505220," All right."
7505220,7507200," So, what we're doing..."
7507200,7507380," Aha."
7507380,7508880," So, does it compile?"
7508880,7509580," Does it compile?"
7509580,7511900," It probably doesn't compile because we have some trash here."
7511900,7513860," Yep."
7513860,7515560," Semicolons and shite."
7515560,7518520," Semicolons and shite."
7518520,7519340," Load the game."
7519340,7520580," Another semicolon."
7522300,7527020," I think the gene crossover function is too aggressive."
7527020,7529260," It destroys coherent agent behavior."
7529260,7530280," Cool."
7530280,7531400," Thank you for letting me know."
7531400,7533580," All right."
7533580,7535300," So, we're going to do a similar thing."
7535300,7537100," FileStream."
7537100,7538160," I've opened."
7538160,7540280," So, filePath."
7540280,7541500," ReadBinary."
7541500,7549660," Can you still do the pop trick with the overlay?"
7549660,7550860," I actually talked about it."
7550860,7552080," I actually talked about it."
7552080,7561160," So, essentially, I want to write an OBS extension or plugin that lets me pause the video capture."
7561160,7563700," The video capture."
7563700,7565480," Similar to how we did that with Mplayer."
7565480,7568720," Anime Watching Party."
7568720,7571700," Well, I'll think about that."
7571700,7573420," I first need to get into the anime."
7573960,7576960," And then we can think about anime watching Platinum."
7576960,7578580," So, yeah."
7578580,7579640," Yeah."
7579640,7582440," So, this sounds like a pretty good topic for one of the streams."
7582440,7584160," Extend OBS."
7584160,7588480," So, you can do the trick with OBS without Mplayer."
7588480,7589420," Yeah."
7589420,7592760," What do you guys think?"
7592760,7593440," Yeah."
7593440,7594400," I think it's a pretty cool idea."
7595180,7598080," Because I never actually worked with an internals of OBS."
7598080,7600960," And I think it would be really interesting for me to do that."
7600960,7602800," All right."
7602800,7604480," If Stream."
7605260,7609560," I actually don't mind some sort of like an anime watching party."
7609560,7612720," We just need to think about how to organize that."
7618260,7621800," I don't think you'll need even you'll even need to use an OBS."
7621800,7626840," You can make a virtual cam then use in OBS."
7626840,7627800," I don't know."
7627800,7631160," We need to research what would be the best solution for this kind of situation."
7631160,7633520," But I want the solution to be as simple as possible."
7633520,7637840," I want the solution to be just installed and just work."
7637840,7642460," I don't really want to do additional work like creating something outside of OBS."
7642460,7643960," Virtual camera something."
7643960,7646560," It's too Linuxy."
7646560,7647460," Right."
7647460,7648900," I want things to just work."
7648900,7649960," Right."
7649960,7652880," I kind of miss things working."
7652880,7661280," So it's the error."
7661280,7662740," I could not."
7662740,7666560," Open file as."
7666560,7670580," Open file as."
7670580,7674140," So it's going to be exit one."
7674140,7676060," Right."
7676660,7684200," A simple solution would be to put the picture of empty chair over camera overlay."
7684200,7688420," But you can also do more tricks than that."
7688420,7691660," You could do more tricks than that in Mplayer."
7691660,7694680," So I don't think it's a sufficient solution."
7694680,7695160," I'm sorry."
7697960,7704920," So after that we just read the stream and we check the size of this entire tab."
7704920,7710780," Why don't you use 3D technologies in your projects?"
7710780,7719380," Because I already use blockchain in my project and I ran out of buzzwords to use in my project."
7719380,7719380," Yeah."
7719380,7729380," What kind of question is that?"
7729380,7730600," What kind of question is that?"
7730600,7731580," Like, Jesus Christ."
7733640,7734020," All right."
7734020,7735500," So let's continue."
7744860,7756340," We're going to exit that."
7756340,7758760," So I almost implemented this thing."
7758760,7759180," Shut."
7759180,7759840," Shut."
7759840,7760860," I almost implementing."
7760860,7762900," Saving and loading the game."
7762900,7765640," What's the 3D technology like?"
7766540,7770400," Like, it's one dimension better than 2D technology."
7770400,7773500," But everyone knows 2D is better."
7778200,7778600," All right."
7778600,7780040," So when I dump in this thing."
7780040,7782420," So I can now dump file."
7782420,7784500," Dump game."
7784500,7787340," And dump file path."
7787340,7791380," And I have to do something like game current."
7791380,7792780," Actually, games current."
7792780,7794200," And I can remove all of this."
7794200,7795340," Scheisse."
7795340,7799880," Dump game."
7799880,7801940," Oh, shit."
7801940,7802480," It compiles."
7802480,7802700," Cool."
7802700,7803760," Okay."
7803760,7805040," So we can start."
7807040,7809800," We can start implementing the trainer."
7809800,7811760," I don't even know how to call that thing."
7811760,7813180," But the."
7813180,7815900," The natural selector."
7815900,7817900," 3D neural network."
7817900,7824100," I mean, aren't they already."
7824100,7825640," Like, multidimensional anyway."
7825640,7828400," If you think about that."
7828400,7830720," Okay."
7830720,7831940," So we need to load the game."
7831940,7834440," We're going to load the game into."
7834440,7836840," We're going to load it from dump file path."
7836840,7838420," And we're going to load it into."
7838420,7844400," Games current."
7844400,7847360," 3D multi."
7847360,7848500," Layer."
7848500,7849760," Receptron."
7849760,7850780," Ah."
7850780,7852560," I see what you mean."
7852560,7853080," Okay."
7853080,7855160," That makes sense."
7855160,7856160," Okay."
7856160,7858280," So this is where we're loading this thing."
7859020,7865200," And what we need to do here is we need to perform several generations."
7865200,7866160," So genu."
7866160,7867580," I."
7867580,7871460," Max generations."
7871460,7876120," So, like, for now, we're going to go with a fixed amount of generations."
7876120,7876800," Right."
7876800,7878680," We're going to go with a fixed amount of generations."
7878680,7880440," Max generations."
7880440,7883600," And let's say we want to have thousands of generations."
7883600,7888240," Benny Darshan."
7888240,7889540," I hope I pronounced your name correctly."
7889540,7892240," You saved blockchain, so you had to suck."
7893400,7894340," That's too easy."
7894340,7897100," But thank you so much for five months of tier one subscription."
7897100,7899560," Thank you."
7899560,7902460," Thank you so much for such a continued support."
7902460,7905760," And welcome to our epic blockchain club."
7905760,7906760," That's right."
7907240,7908460," So, you see, streaming and easy."
7908460,7912320," You're just screaming buzzwords and people throw money at you."
7912320,7913340," Yeah."
7913340,7917140," Sounds like IT in general."
7917140,7917740," Right."
7917740,7922600," Because in a modern IT, what you do, you're just screaming buzzwords and people throw money at you."
7922600,7923600," That's how it works."
7923600,7924800," I think."
7924800,7926700," I think that's how it works."
7926700,7934460," All right."
7935500,7938560," So, we need a function."
7938560,7939600," Actually, chat."
7939600,7941040," We need a function."
7941040,7947600," Is everyone dead?"
7947600,7952460," Guess what this function does?"
7952460,7958240," Is everyone dead?"
7958240,7961840," So, basically, it checks whether everyone is dead or not."
7961840,7964840," And I think that's the time to..."
7965500,7969040," Generate a new generation."
7969040,7973160," Blockchain, neural networks, machine learning, cryptocurrencies, game dev."
7973160,7974860," So, I didn't use mesh shaders."
7974860,7976880," Yes."
7976880,7979940," I'm going to use them."
7979940,7982200," I'm going to use mesh shaders for all of these things."
7982200,7984920," Imagine using mesh shaders for blockchain."
7984920,7986720," That actually sounds fucking awesome."
7986720,7988180," Mine got."
7988180,7989700," Mine got."
7990180,7991200," Absolutely fucking awesome."
7991200,7992980," So, how are we going to check that?"
7992980,7994560," We're going to iterate through all of these motherfuckers."
7994560,7998100," Agents count."
7999780,8007320," And if a game agent's eye health is greater than zero, that means..."
8007320,8007940," Nope."
8007940,8010080," Otherwise..."
8010080,8010380," Yep."
8010380,8011420," Yep."
8011420,8011660," Come."
8011660,8012480," Yep."
8012480,8012620," Come."
8012620,8016320," Throw a nuclear missile at..."
8016320,8017320," Miss missile at..."
8017320,8017820," Huh."
8019260,8020800," Nah, we're going to implement it later."
8020800,8022220," But thank you for the suggestion."
8022220,8026920," It's when your generation goes to shit."
8026920,8029320," Oh, would you look at that."
8029320,8030620," Something went wrong here."
8030620,8033940," And I didn't really change any parameters."
8035940,8038120," I didn't even change any parameters."
8038120,8040040," But we already have an incorrect game."
8040040,8041160," What the fuck?"
8041160,8043860," That's really strange."
8043860,8047660," So, uh..."
8047660,8048140," Okay, okay."
8048140,8050060," If I try to..."
8050060,8052200," Save this thing differently."
8052200,8060200," Hmm..."
8060200,8062440," It's already mesh shader hots."
8062440,8067520," Sure."
8067520,8069620," Okay."
8069620,8071820," So, I dumped some shit again."
8071820,8072340," Didn't I?"
8072340,8075700," Yeah, I dumped some shit again."
8075700,8078560," So, I can go back and..."
8078560,8083740," Just switch to a different thing here."
8083740,8086800," And hopefully, it will be able to load it up."
8086800,8087300," Hopefully."
8087300,8088120," We'll see."
8088120,8091420," We'll see if it will be able to load it up."
8091500,8092680," And it doesn't load it up."
8092680,8097020," So, it just says that the size of this thing is not equal to the size of the game."
8097020,8098140," And I wonder why."
8098140,8101000," Is it because it can't read the whole thing at once?"
8101000,8105680," Hmm..."
8105680,8108200," So, we can try to inspect all of that."
8108200,8110920," So, um..."
8110920,8114860," Yeah, probably a free does not guarantee that she can read all of that at once."
8115100,8116960," So, I'm just being Bebega as usual."
8116960,8120360," I'm just being Bebega as usual."
8120360,8124980," I'm so good used to being Bebega that I don't really care anymore."
8124980,8127800," I feel like I'm not a..."
8127800,8130840," I'm not a very successful programmer anyway."
8132840,8136500," The size of the game is always 8."
8136500,8139140," But..."
8139140,8141680," I dereferenced that thing, didn't I?"
8141680,8142820," Yeah."
8142820,8144080," So, yeah."
8144080,8145600," Don't worry about it."
8145600,8146360," I'm also Bebega."
8146360,8156920," And it read only one character."
8156920,8159740," That's very interesting."
8159740,8162260," And I think..."
8162260,8164720," I'm the hugest Bebega ever..."
8164720,8165020," Yeah."
8165020,8166280," Can't read it anymore."
8166280,8168000," It's understandable."
8168000,8169440," Don't worry."
8169440,8174340," So, size of a single thing."
8176360,8182800," What if I wrote a thing incorrectly?"
8182800,8188120," So, this is a write and this is a read."
8188120,8190300," Why did it read only a single thing?"
8190300,8193440," Uh..."
8193440,8193960," fread."
8193960,8197400," Oh, it returns the amount of things!"
8197400,8198640," Oh my god."
8198640,8201380," fread and fwrite interface is so confusing."
8201380,8205060," So, fread and fwrite interface, it doesn't work with the row bytes."
8205280,8207280," It works with elements."
8207280,8212540," And what it returns, it doesn't return you the amount of bytes a thread."
8212540,8215320," It returns you the amount of elements a thread."
8215320,8221100," And what essentially I said, I said, read one element of the size of the game."
8221100,8224200," And of course, this mother flipper returned me one."
8224200,8225840," Jesus Christ."
8225840,8227420," I almost had a heart attack."
8227420,8228080," Oh my god."
8228720,8229640," So, because..."
8229640,8230900," Yeah, it's so scuffed."
8230900,8232060," I mean, it's confusing."
8232060,8234480," Yeah."
8234480,8237460," So, here you specify the size of the elements you want to read."
8237460,8239280," And then you specify the amount of elements."
8239280,8241440," And since I have only one game, it makes sense."
8241440,8243300," Okay, so here's the size of the element."
8243300,8244340," And I have one game."
8244340,8245040," Read one game."
8246080,8251620," So, and I don't know why for some reason I thought, like, it will return the amount of bytes."
8251620,8253380," But, yeah, it is what it is."
8253380,8255520," It is what it is."
8255520,8256920," Cool."
8258000,8260740," Sounds like something Fang Chi would design for his language."
8260740,8263760," Do we have Fang Chi here today?"
8263760,8265100," He's probably sleeping."
8265100,8265740," Yeah."
8265740,8271960," I mean, Fang Chi is a huge fan of C."
8271960,8274460," So, maybe C actually influenced..."
8274460,8277560," Well, C did influence his language a lot."
8277560,8278680," So, no."
8278680,8282180," All right."
8282180,8284960," So, now if I try to run this entire thing..."
8284960,8288660," Right, if I try to run, everything seems to be okie-dokie, okie-dokie."
8288660,8295140," So, and this is where we are starting to do a generational thing."
8295140,8297700," Hello, Mem2PL."
8297700,8298140," Welcome."
8298140,8299080," Welcome to the stream."
8299080,8302160," And a huge fan of making scap design decisions, too."
8302160,8304320," Well, I mean..."
8304320,8305040," Aren't we all?"
8305040,8308760," How many scap design decisions I've made throughout my life?"
8308760,8309840," That's actually a lot."
8314960,8321280," Because how do we come up with good designs?"
8321280,8324840," Basically, we come up with the first scap design."
8324840,8327020," And we put it out there."
8327020,8328700," People start using it."
8328700,8332200," And people start reading at you for a scap design."
8332200,8333200," And you fix it."
8333200,8333860," Right."
8333860,8338540," So, I guess that's how we come up with all of that."
8340040,8344400," Because when you're making a design, it's kind of difficult for you to keep the reality check."
8344400,8345080," Right."
8345080,8345560," Sometimes."
8345560,8347660," Because you're designing in your own world."
8347660,8351380," But you don't really know how it's going to be applicable for other people."
8351380,8356060," So, you need to put it out there and wait for people to start reading at you."
8356060,8358660," Iterate your customers."
8358660,8361180," Yeah."
8362460,8363720," That's an interesting idea."
8363720,8364780," Okay."
8364780,8378080," So, while not everyone is dead, we're going to step the game."
8378080,8379400," So, step game."
8379400,8382060," And we're just stepping the game."
8382060,8383100," Right."
8384060,8393120," Once everyone is dead, we are making the next generation."
8393120,8395000," Like this."
8395000,8397820," Next generation."
8397820,8402520," And continue this entire cycle."
8402520,8405140," And we do like thousands of generations."
8405140,8405800," Right."
8405800,8407160," We do thousands of generations."
8408120,8418600," And afterwards, what I want to do actually, so we have a new generation."
8418600,8423300," And I think what I want to do here is to dump that generation."
8423300,8429280," Dump game, dump file path of the current game."
8429280,8432760," But to be fair, I think it should have like a different name."
8434600,8436180," So, dump file path."
8436180,8438820," So, let's have something like."
8438820,8445800," Trained file path."
8445800,8447920," So, trained."
8447920,8449480," Bin."
8449480,8455740," So, and maybe it will also make sense to log what's going on."
8455740,8456760," Generation."
8456760,8458680," I."
8458680,8459420," Right."
8459420,8461180," And also."
8461180,8462920," Like this."
8462920,8463680," Okay."
8464200,8465040," So, here we go."
8465040,8466320," We're just training things."
8466320,8468760," Thousands of times."
8468760,8473620," And then we dump the latest generation."
8473620,8478540," The next thing we're going to do afterwards, we're going to switch to our visualization."
8478540,8483360," And we're going to look how that generation performs after all of this, all of this training."
8483360,8486540," Just to get the gist of all of this thing."
8486540,8488540," All right."
8488540,8491560," So, I'm starting the training right now."
8491560,8493580," Generation zero."
8493800,8495220," Generation one."
8495220,8495220," Generation one."
8495220,8495940," Oh, shit."
8495940,8499060," Thousands of generations is actually going to be super fucking slow."
8499060,8502220," Is it really..."
8502220,8504320," Hmm."
8504320,8516600," Wait."
8516600,8516640," Wait."
8516640,8521640," Do you notice that it's getting longer?"
8521640,8524560," Why is it getting longer?"
8524560,8528240," Is it getting longer because they're starting to live longer?"
8528240,8533880," Wait a fucking second."
8533880,8535020," That's actually very interesting."
8540560,8541400," think about it."
8541400,8541420," Think about it."
8541420,8541440," Think about it."
8541440,8541440," Think about it."
8541440,8543360," It's kind of getting longer."
8543360,8546840," Okay."
8546840,8547760," So, I have an idea."
8547760,8550340," Let's actually make amount of generations like 10."
8554340,8558120," So, the first generation is like they take..."
8558120,8563480," Maybe we can also print the amount of times, like, yeah, amount of time."
8566900,8572120," So, GP, it's actually very fucking interesting."
8572120,8574740," So, it feels like it's increasing or something."
8574740,8578040," It's a success or a memory leak."
8578040,8581040," Well, I don't have a single malloc."
8581040,8581800," I don't have a single malloc."
8581800,8583720," Right."
8583720,8588260," So, SRC, grab rn malloc."
8588260,8590160," So, not a single malloc."
8590160,8592420," I don't think I have a memory leak."
8592420,8593940," I also don't have a single calloc."
8593940,8594860," Right."
8594860,8596400," I don't allocate any dynamic memory."
8596400,8599840," So, and that's exactly the reason, by the way."
8599840,8602100," So, I don't have to deal with the memory leaks and stuff like that."
8602520,8602760," Right."
8602760,8605160," So, I just pre-allocate as much memory as I need."
8605160,8606300," And I just use that memory."
8606300,8608340," It's like my favorite style of development."
8608340,8611800," Because in that case, you're almost programming, like, with a garbage collector."
8611800,8613920," Because you don't manage memory."
8613920,8616860," But the reason why you don't manage memory is because you don't have any fucking memory."
8616860,8618080," Anyway."
8618080,8625500," So, what I want to do here is clock T begin."
8625500,8627240," Clock."
8627240,8628060," Big brain."
8628060,8628580," Exactly."
8628580,8631760," GPC."
8631760,8633220," So, we have time."
8633220,8635520," Print F."
8635520,8643520," So, I'm going to do it like that."
8643520,8645900," I'm going to also flush STD out."
8645900,8651380," And here we're going to print something like F."
8651380,8654660," So, it's going to be clock minus begin."
8654660,8660040," And I need something like divided by clocks per cycle."
8660040,8661500," Does anybody remember how it's called?"
8661760,8664520," Cloaks per cycle?"
8664520,8665760," Is that what it is?"
8665760,8666940," Per sec."
8666940,8667680," Cloaks per sec."
8667680,8668140," Okay."
8668140,8670720," So, this is a clocks per sec."
8670720,8672300," Yep."
8672640,8675440," And we need to cast it to float."
8675440,8675440," So, we need to cast it to float."
8675440,8677920," And cast that to float as well."
8677920,8679180," And this is S."
8679180,8680720," And there we go."
8680720,8683400," Might as well flush it once again."
8683400,8684440," Just in case."
8684440,8685500," Because you never know."
8687100,8691700," My chat arena highlighted brain because there is a person called that in this chat."
8691700,8693800," Interesting."
8693800,8696940," Oh, I didn't know that chat arena can do this kind of stuff."
8699020,8699640," All right."
8699640,8702180," So, let's go."
8702180,8704040," Doesn't compile."
8704040,8705620," Please compile."
8705620,8708600," Okay."
8708600,8709320," Two seconds."
8709320,8713340," Four."
8713340,8715300," It takes longer."
8715300,8715920," What the fuck?"
8715920,8717860," Why does it take longer to do this kind of shit?"
8719860,8724520," All right."
8724520,8726800," So, the time is really increasing, I think."
8726800,8731860," Not always, but..."
8731860,8734840," Processor leak."
8734840,8738640," And it goes, like, to five seconds and just stays."
8738640,8741840," And then it goes down, I see."
8741840,8744680," Maybe they leave longer."
8744680,8745440," I don't know."
8745440,8746900," Who knows?"
8749860,8750580," I hope they do."
8750580,8755060," What does genetic programming do?"
8755060,8758220," It optimizes the problem using genetic algorithms."
8758220,8761900," But it's..."
8761900,8762040," Yeah."
8762040,8763660," Oh, shit."
8763660,8765100," It didn't actually dump anything."
8765100,8765700," God damn it."
8765700,8766260," Why?"
8766260,8768420," Why didn't it dump anything?"
8768420,8771700," Oh, it dumped the same thing to itself."
8771700,8772520," God damn it."
8772520,8777900," I want it to dump, like, to train."
8777900,8779840," All right."
8779860,8784100," So, I wanted it to dump the train, but I guess that's okay."
8784100,8789420," So, then, after the 10 generations, we can take a look at how they look like."
8789420,8792740," And hopefully, maybe they will start doing some useful shite."
8792740,8800140," So, here, instead of init games, what we need to do is load game."
8800940,8805780," So, again, it's going to be games current, and we're loading it from dump file."
8806020,8806580," So, that should be it."
8806580,8807060," So, that should be it."
8807060,8810660," And then, we're going to switch our entry point."
8810660,8812540," So, we're switching our entry point."
8812540,8819780," Could you easily calculate the average lifetime in each generation or some other performance measure?"
8819980,8820940," Yeah, I think we could."
8820940,8830820," So, let's actually see what kind of generation we generated."
8832820,8836260," Something went wrong horribly."
8836260,8837980," I don't understand really why."
8837980,8838360," What?"
8838360,8839380," But..."
8839380,8844540," I think I fucked up the thing that we generated."
8854100,8855480," That was really strange, but..."
8855480,8861480," Why did they die inst..."
8861480,8863240," Did they move or something?"
8863240,8865960," I don't quite understand what happens."
8865960,8866800," Do they move?"
8866800,8869820," One more time."
8869820,8873840," So, okay."
8873840,8875160," Something is happening here."
8875160,8877680," I need to keep my eyes closed to that."
8877680,8880260," Okay."
8880260,8883640," So, some of them, like majority of them who were in front of the food,"
8883760,8885180," they moved towards the food."
8885180,8886420," All right."
8886420,8888120," So, what they do..."
8888120,8888760," They're moving..."
8888760,8888920," Okay."
8888920,8892140," So, the ones that moved towards the food sort of survived."
8892140,8895500," But if there's no food in front of them,"
8895500,8897000," they don't really survive much."
8897000,8899720," So..."
8899720,8900360," Yeah."
8900360,8902480," But it's actually..."
8902480,8903680," I think it's actually working."
8903680,8907120," After 10 generations, we found some of the species"
8907120,8913480," that simply have a gene that makes them move towards the food."
8913760,8915160," I think this is already something."
8915160,8915700," Is it not?"
8915700,8917600," Think about it."
8917600,8919700," By the way, can you see that?"
8919700,8921420," Can you see how they move towards the food?"
8921420,8924540," Especially the one on the left."
8924540,8927480," Yeah."
8927480,8928460," For example, this one."
8928460,8930000," Look at this one."
8930540,8933240," Like, there's like a row of food in front of them."
8933240,8934860," And what they're doing here,"
8934860,8936780," they're moving towards the food."
8936780,8941140," And they consumed all of the food."
8941140,8942680," And they're going to survive the longest."
8942680,8944160," Right."
8944160,8945380," So, they survived."
8945380,8946600," So, and there's a lot of them."
8946600,8948000," So, what they developed..."
8948000,8949840," They developed a very simple gene."
8952080,8955140," So, that gene is that if you have a food in front of you,"
8955140,8956260," you move forward."
8956260,8959340," But unfortunately, they don't have a gene to do something else."
8959340,8961080," Right."
8961080,8963020," So, we need more generations and stuff."
8963020,8965380," Does anyone know where the food is?"
8965380,8965880," Yeah, yeah."
8965880,8968920," So, there is like a parameter of a gene."
8968920,8970580," If you have like a food in front of you,"
8970580,8972160," you can perform a particular action."
8972160,8973840," Right."
8975840,8977400," So, they have a little bit of vision."
8977400,8981320," Next, simulate epidemic in the population."
8981320,8984100," I actually wanted to do something like that"
8984100,8985920," after I watched the 3B1 Brown video."
8985920,8989100," Like, because 3B1 Brown did like a video on that."
8989100,8991800," And that would be actually pretty interesting to do as well."
8991800,9000220," No cannibalism."
9000220,9002200," You know what?"
9002200,9004480," Can we make..."
9005840,9007240," Like a simpler..."
9007240,9008300," Like a smaller..."
9008300,9009800," Uh..."
9009800,9010040," Thing."
9010040,9012000," Smaller board."
9012000,9012820," Uh..."
9012820,9015340," Smaller amount of entities and stuff like that."
9015340,9016520," Um..."
9016520,9018480," Because..."
9018480,9019240," Like right now,"
9019240,9020840," thousand by thousands..."
9020840,9021140," Uh..."
9021140,9021380," Right."
9021380,9022720," So, we have thousand by thousand."
9022720,9024640," Um..."
9024640,9026520," Oh, hundred by hundred actually."
9026520,9028000," Not that many, but..."
9028000,9028560," But still."
9028560,9030440," We have like thousands of agents."
9030440,9032600," But maybe that's okay."
9032600,9035020," So, right now, it's actually kind of slow."
9035020,9037300," The whole training process is extremely slow."
9037300,9039480," And, um..."
9039480,9048160," This is because we have a lot of like linear algorithms and stuff like that."
9048160,9054540," Can we parallel that?"
9054540,9055200," Probably not."
9056200,9056520," Uh..."
9056520,9058080," But it will be interesting to..."
9058080,9058820," A little..."
9058820,9060900," Leave it like a little bit longer."
9060900,9063880," And to see if we can come up with a interesting..."
9063880,9065580," More interesting generations and stuff like that."
9065580,9067160," All right."
9067160,9067400," Anyway."
9067400,9069340," I want to commit whatever we have."
9069340,9072740," I also would like to like separate these two executable."
9072740,9074220," Executables."
9075980,9078200," We really need to separate these two executables."
9078200,9080740," The one that will like train these things."
9080740,9084020," And the one that will visualize their behavior and whatnot."
9084020,9086880," Um..."
9086880,9089700," Mm-hmm."
9089700,9091940," So, but I need to think how to do all of that."
9091940,9092700," So..."
9092700,9094160," Let me think."
9098260,9108180," see um main so i think visualization is going to be purely um just stepping through"
9108180,9114180," the stepping throne so also we have this thing"
9114180,9125780," um i feel like they need more context like seeing until a wall max to five should be good or the for"
9125780,9130260," the agent brain cool i'm really glad that you think so thank you for sharing your thoughts"
9130260,9139780," uh i'm really happy to listen other people's thoughts on the topic cool um now let me think"
9139780,9143540," what would be the best way to do that"
9143540,9149060," because if if we're gonna have like a separate executables"
9151860,9158260," we need uh two separate single compilation units right two separate single compilation units"
9158260,9173380," and that means i'll have to move this entire thing this entire thing in here if that makes any sense"
9175780,9177620," i have to move this entire thing here"
9177620,9183860," so let me quickly try to do that"
9183860,9192420," so we'll have to do a little bit of refactoring"
9192420,9204660," um so header i'm not gonna have any headers right now so this is gonna be that"
9205780,9235760," Thank you."
9235780,9241500," Refresh the page, refresh the page, otherwise you're going to have the delay."
9241500,9244100," I'm really sorry, I really apologize for this."
9244100,9245520," I think it was kind of my fault."
9245520,9250200," So, yeah, I'm really sorry."
9250200,9252180," CIA, I think so."
9252180,9253160," Maybe it was KGB."
9253160,9256660," Yeah, welcome, welcome back."
9256660,9257520," Welcome back."
9257520,9260760," Okay, so we're going to have this thing here."
9263640,9267660," Okay, and the trainer is going to have this kind of stuff."
9267660,9272300," So we're going to extract this to the trainer and this is going to be a separate executable."
9272300,9275160," So we have two separate executables for all of that."
9275160,9278500," All right."
9278740,9286740," And on top of that, I think we're going to first try to init game first."
9286740,9288300," We'll do init game first."
9288300,9292660," Oh, yeah, by the way, reset player in FFZ is actually amazing."
9292660,9294700," I absolutely love that feature of FFZ."
9300020,9302220," So I don't think we need that thing anymore."
9302220,9306080," So the idea is going to be, we're going to have like a command line arguments for all of that."
9306080,9309620," And the entire thing is going to just load them."
9309620,9316320," Okay, so we're going to have GP trainer and GP simulator."
9317620,9322360," So GP trainer and GP simulator, and these are different executables, right?"
9322360,9325180," So, and we have to build them correspondently."
9325180,9335160," So, so this one is going to be GP trainer, GP simulator, simulator."
9337060,9339560," Yeah, the first one is to just train some things."
9339560,9343280," The second one is to see the results of the training."
9343280,9346540," And I think it, it kind of does make sense."
9346540,9348920," Okay, let's go to the make file."
9348920,9357460," And what we want to build here is we want to build all essentially GP trainer,"
9357460,9361340," trainer and GP simulator."
9362280,9367540," So, and these are going to be separate targets, separate targets."
9367540,9369080," There we go."
9369080,9374240," So, so welcome back, FFZ, welcome to the stream."
9374240,9378780," So, GP trainer depends on the, so see GP trainer C."
9378780,9388920," And I suppose it also depends on game and visual part."
9388920,9391480," Game and visual part."
9392140,9392880," I think so."
9392880,9396460," So, so the game and visual."
9396460,9398020," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
9398020,9403000," So, it's going to be SRC."
9403000,9417640," GP, game H, GP."
9417640,9420160," Let's actually do it like something like common."
9422000,9423520," So, this is a common SRC, right?"
9423520,9427960," So, this is a common SRC, something that is shared between all the executables."
9427960,9438280," And that common SRC is essentially GP game H, GP game C, GP game visual H, and visual C."
9438280,9440300," So, like a visual C++, right?"
9441140,9447080," So, what we're doing here, what is LM, it's a math library."
9447080,9454660," So, in Linux, quite often, math library is a separate library that you have to link to if you have such functions."
9454660,9459280," If you want to have such functions that sine, cosine, like anything from math.h."
9459660,9463860," It's not really a thing on Windows, but on Linux, you really have to do that."
9463860,9466580," Right."
9466580,9467680," There we go."
9469120,9470960," So, similarly for the simulator."
9470960,9476200," Tainer."
9476200,9477300," It's not a tainer."
9477300,9479120," Right."
9479120,9483720," Simulator."
9483720,9484400," There we go."
9484640,9486760," So, these are the things that we want to build here."
9486760,9489720," Now, let's see how they're going to build."
9489720,9493180," Shouldn't be the flag inside of the string."
9493180,9493640," No."
9493640,9495220," This is not a string, by the way."
9495220,9497820," Backticks in shell mean different thing."
9497820,9499780," So, this is a shell command."
9500380,9509860," And backticks mean that they will take the shell command, execute it, and they will put the output of that command as the value here."
9509860,9511560," They will just copy-paste the output here."
9511560,9516840," So, essentially, what I'm doing here, I'm just calling this function."
9516840,9517780," Right."
9517780,9522340," And I want this backtick string to replace with this kind of stuff."
9522340,9524760," Learn about, like, backticks and shell."
9524760,9530360," So, it's like, yeah, it's the basics of shell."
9530380,9536560," So, it's the basics of shell."
9536560,9537520," All right."
9537520,9542100," So, let's try to build all that stuff and see if it's going to work correctly."
9542100,9544320," So, no rule for game HP."
9544320,9547220," This is because you have to prefix all of them with SRC."
9547220,9548700," Right."
9548700,9550580," You have to prefix all of that with SRC."
9550580,9553420," Mm-hmm."
9553420,9556200," All right."
9556200,9560120," So, and I also have to do similarly."
9561000,9561520," Simulator."
9561520,9564220," So, I need two games here as well."
9564220,9566120," And there we go."
9566120,9569560," Mm-hmm."
9569560,9571220," Dump file."
9571220,9573080," And then we're dumping the file."
9573080,9574040," Okay."
9574040,9575880," Mm-hmm."
9576100,9580480," So, I think we need to provide the output file as an argument for this executable."
9580480,9583660," So, and that's exactly what I'm going to try to do."
9583660,9586240," So, this is the current."
9586240,9586620," Okay."
9586620,9587860," So, the current is going to go here."
9587860,9592940," If RGC is less than two."
9592940,9595440," If it's less than two, we're going to do fprintf."
9595940,9596660," StdError."
9596660,9599300," Error."
9599300,9603860," Output file path is not provided."
9603860,9605160," Provided."
9605160,9605900," There we go."
9605900,9608300," And we're going to exit with one."
9608560,9610760," And also, we need to print the usage."
9610760,9612100," StdError."
9612100,9612980," Usage."
9612980,9615600," GP trainer."
9615600,9617940," Something like output."
9617940,9619600," There we go."
9619600,9623460," So, maybe we'll also be able to customize amount of generations."
9627180,9641640," So, maybe we have to do something like this."
9641640,9648620," Generation, generation, generations number."
9648620,9650120," Generations count."
9650120,9650840," Right."
9650840,9654720," So, you will have to provide the output and the generations count."
9654820,9658960," And maybe the first thing has to be the generations count."
9658960,9660480," Something like this."
9660480,9663340," Yep."
9663340,9668820," So, I also want to implement like a pretty convenient function for parsing arguments."
9668820,9669940," Yeah."
9669940,9672820," Similar to how I do that in Aids in C++."
9672820,9675880," So, it's going to be a shift."
9675880,9679660," And I'm going to accept the pointer to RGC."
9679660,9683380," And maybe triple pointer to RGV."
9683700,9686340," So, I can automatically shift this kind of stuff."
9686340,9697060," So, and yeah."
9697060,9699740," If RGC."
9699740,9702180," Yeah."
9702180,9707520," Maybe it makes sense to assert this thing to be equal to zero."
9708000,9712100," And essentially, we're going to have a result."
9712100,9714300," We're going to have a result."
9714300,9717620," Which is something like this."
9717620,9718460," Right."
9718580,9722460," And afterwards, we're going to do RGC minus one."
9722460,9725700," Minus one."
9725700,9729300," And RGV plus one."
9729300,9732420," So, and then we'll be able to return the result."
9732420,9735000," So, I'm not sure if it's going to work correctly."
9735000,9738820," But it may actually help triple pointer."
9738820,9740460," I'm not sure if triple pointer actually makes..."
9740460,9743200," Am I a three-star developer now?"
9743200,9745680," Am I a three-star developer?"
9745680,9746560," Maybe."
9746560,9752680," Three-star developer."
9752680,9755280," Oh, shit."
9757100,9759340," I finally unlocked the achievement."
9759340,9764180," I finally unlocked this achievement."
9764180,9765000," I think."
9765000,9768100," Shit."
9769060,9771800," I don't know if it's ever going to work."
9771800,9772540," But we'll see."
9772540,9774060," So, essentially."
9774060,9775200," The first thing I want to do."
9775200,9777780," I want to skip this shit."
9777780,9779640," I'm going to skip this shit."
9779640,9782840," Skip program name."
9782840,9783780," Thank you."
9783780,9784660," Thank you for awarding me."
9784660,9786660," And if."
9786660,9788960," Oh, shit."
9788960,9790800," RGC."
9790800,9792880," Equal than zero."
9792880,9793680," That means."
9793680,9794960," Yeah."
9794960,9797520," We'll have to also have some sort of a usage."
9798800,9802560," Pointed to two-dimensional."
9802560,9803900," Yeah, basically."
9803900,9806420," It's a point of two-dimensional."
9806420,9807720," Hello, Viljanul."
9807720,9808480," Welcome to the stream."
9808480,9811780," I recently became a three-star developer."
9811780,9813560," But it's not confirmed yet."
9813560,9814200," It's not."
9814200,9815600," We're still waiting for verification."
9815600,9818620," And after this code compiles,"
9818620,9822880," maybe I'll officially become a three-star developer."
9822880,9825460," We'll see."
9825460,9826060," We'll see."
9828140,9829740," So, this one is going to stream."
9829740,9831120," Generation count."
9831120,9833580," So, if this thing is not available,"
9833580,9836240," we'll have to say something like usage."
9836240,9837340," STD error."
9837340,9839980," Then printf."
9839980,9841700," F printf."
9841700,9842600," STD error."
9842600,9848480," No generations count."
9850480,9855340," number of generations is not provided."
9855340,9860620," Okay."
9860620,9867480," And then I'll have to exit with one."
9867480,9868320," All right."
9868320,9873740," So, and then we do shift RGC, RGV."
9874240,9876780," And that thing I want to, in this case,"
9876780,9878360," I want to use A to I."
9878360,9879420," A to I."
9879420,9880440," All right."
9880440,9882400," And that gives me the generation,"
9882400,9883580," number of generations."
9883580,9886660," So, this is going to be generations count."
9886660,9887640," Like this."
9887640,9888800," There we go."
9889920,9891380," So, afterwards,"
9891380,9894600," I want to check this thing again."
9894600,9895440," All right."
9895440,9896100," Error."
9896100,9897740," Output."
9897740,9899420," Output."
9899420,9901900," File path is not provided."
9901900,9903180," And"
9903180,9904500," sharp."
9904500,9906820," Output."
9906820,9908580," File path is going to be shift."
9908580,9910020," RGC."
9910020,9911640," RGV."
9911640,9915740," A to I."
9915740,9916620," Did I say A to E?"
9916620,9918320," A to I."
9918320,9919340," I'm sorry."
9919340,9921060," I'm rushing the burger."
9921060,9922440," All right."
9922440,9922880," So,"
9922880,9925560," output file path."
9925560,9928520," Okay."
9928520,9929940," Generation count is not used"
9929940,9931580," because we have to use max count."
9932920,9934120," Generation count."
9934120,9937660," Oh, shit."
9937660,9938500," It actually worked."
9938500,9940420," Well,"
9940420,9942040," I guess there we go."
9942040,9944620," I'm officially a triple star developer"
9944620,9945920," because it compiled"
9945920,9947680," and I think it can even work now."
9947680,9949920," So, let me see"
9949920,9951340," if we can call this function,"
9951340,9952460," this program,"
9952460,9952740," so,"
9952740,9953400," GP trainer."
9953400,9954560," Okay."
9954560,9956140," No number of generations is provided."
9956140,9957820," Then I provide 69 of them"
9957820,9959280," and no output file,"
9959280,9960200," output path."
9960200,9961460," And I provide both of them"
9961460,9962380," and it works."
9962380,9962660," Okay."
9962660,9962900," So,"
9962900,9964460," my idea with the shift function"
9964460,9965320," actually worked."
9965320,9966200," So,"
9966200,9967380," this is actually a pretty cool"
9967380,9968640," function,"
9968640,9969280," as you can see."
9969280,9970100," So,"
9970100,9970580," essentially,"
9970580,9973360," it modifies RGC and RGV"
9973360,9974740," and basically shifts"
9974740,9976200," the first argument to the left."
9976200,9976440," So,"
9976440,9978280," you basically consume the argument."
9978280,9978980," It's kind of similar"
9978980,9980540," to how I do that in A,"
9980540,9981320," but in C."
9981320,9982320," Right."
9982700,9984140," and to implement this kind of thing,"
9984140,9984920," I need triple star,"
9984920,9986160," triple star,"
9986160,9988080," like triple pointer"
9988080,9989260," and it worked."
9989260,9990620," Surprisingly enough."
9990620,9992520," Yeah."
9992520,9995680," It's pretty cool."
9998680,9999600," I'm proud of myself."
9999600,9999660," I'm proud of myself."
9999660,10002340," And by the way,"
10002340,10003180," we're, you know,"
10003180,10004000," generating"
10004000,10006100," several of these things."
10006100,10009700," The achievement"
10009700,10011120," was hiding in the playing side."
10011120,10011540," Exactly."
10011540,10012980," It was hiding in the playing side."
10017680,10018160," So,"
10018160,10019780," maybe we're going to wait a little bit."
10019780,10022220," It actually becomes faster"
10022220,10022920," over time."
10022920,10027200," What about five stars?"
10027200,10028300," Is there like a"
10028300,10029420," five star?"
10029420,10031380," All right."
10031380,10035960," No,"
10035960,10037240," a five star is not someone"
10037240,10038920," whose code contains"
10038920,10040160," five levels of indirection."
10040160,10041300," Rather,"
10041300,10042520," a five star is someone"
10042520,10043420," who has reached"
10043420,10044220," the highest peak"
10044220,10045080," of programming craft,"
10045080,10045920," one who can,"
10045920,10046720," who has reached"
10046720,10047660," programming in light"
10047660,10047860," enlightenment."
10047860,10050820," But what's the criteria?"
10050820,10053380," Three star level"
10053380,10054280," is someone who has learned"
10054280,10055380," to do three star programming"
10055380,10056300," and reveals into it."
10056300,10057440," Someone who has learned"
10057440,10058780," how to do three stars programming"
10058780,10060120," but has also learned"
10060120,10061720," to not do it"
10061720,10062640," unless circumstances"
10062640,10063980," absolutely require it."
10063980,10064720," Ah,"
10064720,10065940," I see."
10065940,10067740," The enlightenment."
10067740,10072920," Five away chill."
10077640,10078500," you have to reach"
10078500,10078860," enlightenment."
10078860,10080020," That's the criteria."
10080020,10080560," I see."
10080560,10083820," What's the enlightenment?"
10083820,10086060," What is it?"
10086060,10088760," I don't know."
10088760,10093000," We're going to wait"
10093000,10094240," for 69 generations."
10097680,10099700," so after 69 generations"
10099700,10100900," maybe it will produce"
10100900,10101600," something interesting."
10101600,10102720," Also,"
10102720,10103640," it's like"
10103640,10105060," single threaded"
10105060,10106400," but I'm not sure"
10106400,10107160," if I can easily"
10107160,10108300," parallelize all of that."
10108300,10110300," If it's even"
10110300,10110980," parallelizable"
10110980,10111600," at all."
10122480,10123620," do type def char"
10123620,10124940," str for funsies."
10124940,10129500," Why?"
10129500,10134240," Okay."
10134240,10136840," But it's not really a string,"
10136840,10137640," is it?"
10137640,10139280," Because it's a mutable string."
10139280,10140520," So,"
10140520,10141420," is that from some"
10141420,10142180," language?"
10142180,10144420," Isn't it supposed"
10144420,10144880," to be like"
10144880,10145420," const char?"
10148160,10148600," Oh,"
10148600,10149160," what's interesting"
10149160,10149580," is that"
10149580,10150660," if you call this"
10150660,10152420," a string,"
10152420,10154040," something with const"
10154040,10154840," could be"
10154840,10155640," a sister."
10155640,10157980," Right?"
10157980,10158800," Makes sense."
10158800,10159920," You can think of it"
10159920,10160920," as c string"
10160920,10162720," or as a const string."
10162720,10166260," Interesting."
10166260,10167620," Thank you for suggesting that."
10167620,10169140," I got enlightened."
10169140,10169760," Now,"
10169760,10170920," I'm a five-star developer."
10170920,10171900," Thank you so much."
10171900,10173380," What if you run"
10173380,10174120," X simulations"
10174120,10174640," at once"
10174640,10175320," and then pick"
10175320,10175920," the best"
10175920,10177240," players?"
10177240,10180120," Maybe."
10180120,10182920," And that will"
10182920,10183720," be parallelizable."
10183720,10185020," They're not improving."
10185020,10186200," They're definitely"
10186200,10186840," not improving."
10186840,10187900," Nothing is improving"
10187900,10188680," here for sure."
10188680,10191720," Yeah."
10191720,10194100," Like,"
10194100,10195400," they're just..."
10195400,10195940," I don't know."
10195940,10197780," They don't know."
10197780,10199400," But we're almost there."
10199400,10200240," We just need to run"
10200240,10201260," 69 simulations."
10203260,10209740," Maybe I have"
10209740,10210860," some sort of bug"
10210860,10211440," somewhere."
10211440,10212120," I wonder."
10212120,10214280," Gene pool to low."
10214280,10214940," Maybe."
10214940,10215800," Maybe we need"
10215800,10217280," a high gene pool."
10217280,10222260," We can try to increase it"
10222260,10224520," at some point."
10224520,10225760," So,"
10225760,10226560," but I do all of that"
10226560,10227500," just to taste things out"
10227500,10228240," because then"
10228240,10229320," I'll have to compile"
10229320,10230480," the simulator"
10230480,10231540," just to see the results."
10231540,10232760," Unfortunately,"
10232920,10233520," you still have"
10233520,10234380," a long way to go"
10234380,10235120," before you become"
10235120,10236040," 10X developer."
10236040,10237740," Yeah,"
10237740,10238180," I know."
10238180,10240320," I know."
10240320,10242260," But one day"
10242260,10242800," maybe"
10242800,10244860," I'll become"
10244860,10245620," 10Xer."
10245620,10249720," 69X developer"
10249720,10251400," when..."
10251400,10257080," Jesus Christ."
10257080,10257940," I'm a child."
10257940,10259600," All right."
10259600,10261420," So,"
10261420,10261960," almost there."
10261960,10262800," The generation"
10262800,10263460," 69"
10263460,10264780," is here."
10264780,10265380," Okay,"
10265380,10266080," so this is the"
10266080,10266980," generation 69."
10266980,10270740," Now,"
10270740,10271640," I need to fix"
10271640,10275200," my compiling"
10275200,10276900," of the simulator."
10276900,10277200," Yeah,"
10277200,10277940," so the simulator"
10277940,10278560," does not compile"
10278560,10279020," right now"
10279020,10283400," because"
10283400,10286460," we don't have"
10286460,10287360," dump file path."
10287360,10288000," So,"
10288000,10288980," we also need to"
10288980,10290700," parse"
10290700,10291460," command 1"
10291460,10292380," arguments for this thing."
10292920,10293120," So,"
10293120,10293520," it's going to be"
10293520,10293980," usage"
10293980,10295300," file"
10295300,10296700," file"
10296700,10297140," string."
10297140,10298540," So,"
10298540,10299100," we're going to do"
10299100,10300120," fprintf"
10300120,10301820," string"
10301820,10303740," gp"
10303740,10304600," simulator"
10304600,10306700," input"
10306700,10309200," bin."
10311200,10311520," Now,"
10311520,10312160," we have to wait"
10312160,10313560," another 69 years"
10313560,10314120," for a chance"
10314120,10314540," to become"
10314540,10315840," 69X developer."
10315840,10316820," Yeah,"
10316820,10318840," that's true."
10318840,10321500," All right."
10321500,10321820," So,"
10321820,10322320," this is going to be"
10322320,10322680," the usage"
10322680,10323360," and let's actually"
10323360,10324060," copy-paste"
10324060,10324640," that"
10324640,10325440," shift"
10325440,10326560," thingy."
10326560,10329160," I really like"
10329160,10330300," this shift idea"
10330300,10330860," for some reason."
10330860,10332360," I have no idea"
10332360,10332680," why."

10372860,10373440," is amazing."
10373440,10374420," I just saw it"
10374420,10375960," on one of the"
10375960,10376480," other chats"
10376480,10377280," and I"
10377280,10378740," instantly thought"
10378740,10379180," that we need"
10379180,10379520," that email"
10379520,10379800," here."
10379800,10384360," It's absolutely"
10384360,10384740," amazing."
10384740,10385240," I love it so"
10385240,10385420," much."
10385420,10388260," All right."
10388260,10389620," So,"
10389620,10390040," in here,"
10390100,10390360," we're going to"
10390360,10390720," do"
10390720,10391760," shift"
10391760,10393640," RGC"
10393640,10395300," RGV"
10395300,10396160," here we go"
10396160,10396600," and we have"
10396600,10397160," an input file"
10397160,10397500," path"
10397500,10398840," that we can"
10398840,10399600," use in"

10402140,10402500," path"

10403640,10404140," I think we"
10404140,10404520," should not"

10407120,10409360," That's for sure."
10409360,10410040," I think I'm going to"
10410040,10410420," disable"
10410420,10411740," all of these"
10411740,10412320," things here"
10412320,10414220," for now."
10414220,10414880," The only thing"
10414880,10415700," that will be"
10415700,10416420," allowed here"
10416420,10416920," is"
10416920,10418420," to be"
10418420,10418560," fair,"
10418560,10419220," why not?"
10419220,10420660," Right."
10420660,10422600," I know why."
10422600,10423580," Let's disable it"
10423580,10423840," for now."
10423840,10426220," All right."
10426220,10426460," So,"
10426460,10426780," let's try to"
10426780,10427780," compile it."
10427780,10429780," And"
10429780,10435920," GPN"
10435920,10437220," trainer."
10437220,10437700," So,"
10437700,10438240," if I try it,"
10438240,10438740," it says"
10438740,10439660," that,"
10439660,10440360," but what about"
10440360,10441240," GPsimulator?"
10441240,10443060," Oh,"
10443060,10443920," I forgot a new"
10443920,10444560," line somewhere."
10444560,10445600," Simulator."
10445600,10449220," I forgot a new"

10449940,10450660," Classic."
10450660,10454940," All right."
10454940,10455700," So,"
10455700,10456180," and what I'm"
10456180,10456540," going to provide"
10456540,10456780," here,"
10456780,10457100," I'm going to"
10457100,10457400," provide"
10457400,10462780," GPsimulator"
10462780,10464360," output pin."
10464360,10464860," Okay,"
10464860,10465480," so here"
10465480,10465940," is"
10465940,10466400," the"
10466400,10467160," generations,"
10467160,10469280," the 69th"
10469280,10470000," generation,"
10470000,10471320," the 69th"
10471320,10471640," generation."
10471640,10472160," Let's see"
10472160,10472740," if they're"
10472740,10473760," less"
10473760,10474440," bebega"
10474440,10475340," than"
10475340,10476000," the first"
10476000,10476440," generation."
10476440,10480060," No,"
10480060,10480520," they're"
10480520,10481320," absolutely"
10481320,10482040," bebega."
10482040,10482980," That's"
10482980,10483380," for sure."
10483380,10485440," They're"
10485440,10485840," absolutely"
10485840,10486540," bebega."
10487400,10487960," All right."
10487960,10489020," That's"
10489020,10489420," pretty cool."
10489420,10490660," I'm super"
10490660,10491580," happy that"
10491580,10491960," they're so"
10491960,10492360," bebega."
10492360,10495200," Okay,"
10495200,10495760," at least we"
10495760,10496400," have tools"
10496400,10498200," for actually"
10498200,10499480," training more"
10499480,10500240," things and"
10500240,10500960," then checking"
10500960,10503400," their results."
10503400,10503800," Right,"
10503800,10504200," so we have"
10504200,10505060," separate tools"
10505060,10505600," that can run"
10505600,10506380," several generations"
10506380,10506920," automatically,"
10506920,10507960," and then we"
10507960,10508500," can see the"
10508500,10509020," results with"
10509020,10509560," another tool."
10509700,10510000," so this"
10510000,10511040," was the"
10511040,10511420," goal"
10511420,10512440," anyway."
10512440,10513300," So,"
10513300,10513740," pepega"
10513740,10514240," simulator."
10514240,10517200," So,"
10517200,10517820," let's go ahead"
10517820,10518340," and commit"
10518340,10519300," whatever we"
10519300,10519980," developed here."
10519980,10521040," Maybe it would"
10521040,10521540," make sense"
10521540,10522080," to update"
10522080,10522520," README"
10522520,10523040," at some"
10523040,10523380," point,"
10523380,10525380," but,"
10525380,10526120," yeah."
10526120,10527380," So,"
10527380,10527900," I'm gonna"
10527900,10528640," update a quick"
10528640,10529020," start."
10529440,10530480," gptrainer"
10530480,10531840," 69"
10531840,10532780," output"
10532780,10533200," bin,"
10533200,10534360," and the"
10534360,10534740," next thing"
10534740,10534980," is gonna"
10534980,10536460," be gpsimulator"
10536460,10538280," simulator"
10538280,10539340," output"
10539340,10540000," bin."
10540000,10540560," So,"
10540560,10541020," it's kind"
10541020,10541400," of important"
10541400,10541820," to update"
10541820,10542140," README"
10542140,10542820," because README"
10542820,10543600," is the"
10543600,10544360," first impression,"
10544360,10545320," right?"
10545320,10545700," So,"
10545700,10546180," this is the"
10546180,10546600," first thing"
10546600,10547040," that people"
10547040,10547580," will see,"
10547580,10548220," and I think"
10548220,10549680," it's important"
10549680,10550080," for these"
10550080,10550580," quick start"
10550580,10551040," instructions"
10551040,10551480," to be"
10551480,10556940," up-to-date."
10556940,10557840," So,"
10557840,10558940," we're gonna"
10558940,10559240," have a"
10559240,10559540," section"
10559540,10560640," called"
10560640,10565220," gpsimulator,"
10565220,10566540," simulator,"
10566540,10567500," and the"
10567500,10567960," controls"
10567960,10568740," are actually"
10568740,10569380," related to"
10569380,10570360," the gpsimulator."
10570360,10571700," Right,"
10571700,10571920," so,"
10571920,10572280," we have"
10572280,10572680," that,"
10572680,10574940," and"
10574940,10576520," we're gonna"
10576520,10577020," also have"
10577020,10577420," gp"
10577420,10578180," trainer,"
10578180,10579260," gp"
10579260,10581020," trainer,"
10581020,10581620," and"
10581620,10582240," it's not"
10582240,10583200," documented"
10583200,10583460," yet."
10583460,10583560," So,"
10583560,10583800," I'm gonna"
10583800,10584120," put to"
10584120,10584480," be done"
10584480,10584780," here,"
10584780,10585280," to-do,"
10585280,10586160," gp"
10586160,10586560," trainer"
10586560,10587380," is not"
10587380,10588260," documented"
10588260,10589060," yet."
10589060,10590000," So,"
10590000,10590400," this is"
10590400,10590660," what we're"
10590660,10591000," gonna put"
10591000,10591240," here."
10591240,10592760," All right."
10592760,10595920," All right."
10595920,10598000," Split"
10598000,10600620," the"
10600620,10601540," whole"
10601540,10602620," application"
10602620,10603700," into"
10603700,10605740," trainer"
10605740,10606420," and"
10606420,10607920," simulator."
10607920,10609740," Zoom"
10609740,10610320," regeneration,"
10610560,10611800," 69th"
10611800,10612380," generation"
10612380,10612800," is a"
10612800,10613100," zoomer"
10613100,10613640," generation."
10613640,10618580," All right."
10618580,10619220," So,"
10619220,10620420," what keyboard"
10620420,10620840," is that?"
10620840,10621800," It's a"
10621800,10622160," USB"
10622160,10622700," keyboard."
10622700,10623680," All right."
10623680,10624160," So,"
10624160,10624640," this is my"
10624640,10624860," logo,"
10624860,10625340," by the way."
10625340,10626680," For some"
10626680,10626820," reason,"
10626820,10627440," I'm so proud"
10627440,10627720," of this"
10627720,10627940," logo,"
10627940,10628400," because the"
10628400,10628700," project"
10628700,10629200," generated"
10629200,10629720," logo for"
10629720,10630080," itself,"
10630080,10630480," and it"
10630480,10630680," looks"
10630680,10631080," amazing."
10631080,10632540," I don't"
10632540,10632680," know,"
10632680,10633040," at least"
10633040,10633380," I like"
10633380,10633660," how it"
10633660,10634080," looks like."
10634080,10634520," It's just"
10634520,10635520," looks pretty"
10635520,10635760," cool."
10637160,10637400," okay,"
10637400,10637700," so we"
10637700,10637880," have"
10637880,10638120," this"
10638120,10638320," kind"
10638320,10638420," of"
10638420,10638700," thing"
10638700,10639180," and"
10639180,10640040," yeah,"
10640040,10640300," there we"
10640300,10640460," go."
10640460,10643020," I think"
10643020,10643860," I forgot to"
10643860,10644620," actually put"
10644620,10645060," a very"
10645060,10645380," important"
10645380,10645740," note"
10645740,10649140," that if"
10649140,10649580," you change"
10649580,10650160," any of the"
10650160,10650820," parameters in"
10650820,10651260," the game,"
10651260,10653900," the game"
10653900,10654380," will become"
10654380,10655540," incompatible with"
10655540,10656060," other parameters,"
10656060,10656840," but I don't think"
10656840,10657180," it's that"
10657180,10657540," important."
10658540,10659160," it kind"
10659160,10659420," of looks"
10659420,10659600," like"
10659600,10659820," commit"
10659820,10660220," history."
10660220,10660760," Well,"
10660760,10661080," yeah,"
10661080,10661640," I suppose."
10661640,10664420," Have you"
10664420,10664560," used"
10664560,10665080," BKB2?"
10665080,10665520," Good choice."
10665520,10665900," I know."
10665900,10666420," Thank you."
10666420,10673400," So,"
10673400,10673960," let's"
10673960,10674160," see."
10674160,10681600," So,"
10681600,10682320," maybe we"
10682320,10682980," should increase"
10682980,10683440," the gene"
10683440,10683740," pool."
10683740,10684640," How about"
10684640,10684940," that?"
10687940,10688360," selection"
10688360,10688720," pool."
10688720,10689000," So,"
10689000,10689300," we only"
10689300,10689540," have"
10689540,10689880," 10"
10689880,10690180," of"
10690180,10690340," these"
10690340,10690700," things"
10690700,10692480," and we"
10692480,10692780," have"
10692780,10693660," thousands"
10693660,10694260," of"
10694260,10694460," these"
10694460,10695040," bebeggas."
10695040,10697420," We have"
10697420,10698020," thousands"
10698020,10698480," of these"
10698480,10698980," bebeggas,"
10698980,10699620," but we"
10699620,10700220," only pick"
10700220,10701400," 10"
10701400,10702700," best of"
10702700,10702900," them."
10702900,10705120," So,"
10705120,10706260," I think"
10706260,10706980," maybe we"
10706980,10707220," should"
10707220,10707940," increase it,"
10707940,10708400," at least"
10708400,10709020," take"
10709020,10710440," quarter of"
10710440,10710620," them."
10710620,10712020," Maybe it"
10712020,10712400," would make"
10712400,10713060," more sense."
10713060,10715140," So,"
10715140,10715300," yeah,"
10715300,10715680," let's actually"
10715680,10716200," give it a try."
10716200,10717000," So,"
10717000,10717480," this is how"
10717480,10717720," we're going"
10717720,10718260," to do"
10718260,10718420," that."
10718420,10718680," I'm going"
10718680,10718980," to rebuild"
10718980,10719440," everything."
10719440,10721420," Best"
10721420,10721980," bebeggas"
10721980,10722640," and among"
10722640,10723240," bebeggas."
10723240,10723700," Yes."
10723700,10724740," All right."
10724740,10725220," So,"
10725220,10725920," let's start"
10725920,10726440," the simulation."
10726440,10727120," You know"
10727120,10727360," what?"
10727360,10727800," Maybe we"
10727800,10727940," should"
10727940,10728420," actually"
10728420,10729180," put the"
10729180,10729720," simulation"
10729720,10730700," to the"
10730700,10730860," make"
10730860,10731200," file."
10731200,10734600," So,"
10734600,10735740," let's"
10735740,10736180," call it"
10736180,10736520," train."
10740720,10741360," So,"
10741360,10741620," GP"
10741620,10742120," trainer."
10742120,10743560," 69"
10743560,10744220," generations."
10744220,10744960," The"
10744960,10745480," output is"
10745480,10745660," going to"
10745660,10745780," be"
10745780,10746180," output"
10746180,10746520," bin."
10746520,10747500," And let's"
10747500,10747980," just wait a"
10747980,10748360," little bit."
10748360,10750200," Let's go."

10766680,10767440," then it's"

10790720,10791280," I'm afraid"

11068440,11068780," system."
11068780,11069380," It's"
11069380,11069620," kind of"
11069620,11069880," difficult"
11069880,11070040," to"
11070040,11070320," define"
11070320,11070560," it."
11074560,11076720," Okay,"
11076720,11078140," so we"
11078140,11078600," actually have"
11078600,11079260," 69th"
11079260,11079720," generation"
11079720,11080280," and"
11080280,11084440," initial"
11084440,11085040," starvation"
11085040,11085460," wave."
11085460,11089600," 100"
11089600,11089960," divided"
11089960,11092360," by one"
11092360,11092760," food"
11092760,11093360," amount."
11093360,11094080," Food"
11094080,11094640," amount"
11094640,11095280," of what?"
11095280,11096900," I don't"
11096900,11097400," understand you."
11097400,11097740," I'm sorry."
11097740,11099020," I think"
11099020,11099160," I'm"
11099160,11099280," the"
11099280,11101320," simulator"
11101320,11103080," so the"
11103080,11103420," output"
11103420,11103780," bin"
11103780,11104540," and"
11104540,11105220," here is"
11105220,11105380," the"
11105380,11105920," 69th"
11105920,11106400," generation."
11106400,11108060," Okay."
11108060,11109680," And again,"
11109680,11110200," they just"
11110200,11110520," stuck."
11110520,11111000," They do"
11111000,11111380," nothing."
11111380,11112360," They literally"
11112360,11112900," do nothing."
11112900,11116780," All right."
11116780,11117420," So,"
11117420,11118080," and then"
11118080,11118640," they die"
11118640,11119200," after some"
11119200,11119520," time."
11119520,11121440," Okay,"
11121440,11121720," cool."
11121720,11122940," By the way,"
11122940,11123380," why does it"
11123380,11123920," take so much"
11123920,11124420," time for a"
11124420,11125100," single generation?"
11125100,11126040," Because I"
11126040,11126780," literally can,"
11126780,11127700," I think I"
11127700,11128320," can do that"
11128320,11128680," faster."
11128680,11130800," Maybe not."
11130800,11133440," Yeah."
11133440,11134520," Maybe"
11134520,11135200," it's around"
11135200,11136480," for a second"
11136480,11137000," or something."
11137000,11141360," Number of"
11141360,11141780," states used"
11141780,11142020," for the"
11142020,11142180," legend."
11142180,11142820," It's actually"
11142820,11143880," hard-coded."
11143880,11144440," The amount"
11144440,11144900," of states"
11144900,11145640," is hard-coded."
11145640,11145920," So,"
11145920,11146320," maybe we"
11146320,11146460," should"
11146460,11147140," increase it."
11147140,11148180," I'll just"
11148180,11148560," try to"
11148560,11149260," increase it."
11149260,11150580," So,"
11150580,11150880," it's like"
11150880,11151180," there's"
11151180,11151720," seven of"
11151720,11151960," them."
11160960,11161960," all right."
11161960,11162000," All right."
11162000,11162320," So,"
11162320,11162780," I want to"
11162780,11163040," make a"
11163040,11163920," small break"
11163920,11164320," because I"
11164320,11164580," need to"
11164580,11164760," pee."
11164760,11166820," And after"
11166820,11167200," I pee,"
11167200,11168280," we can try to"
11168280,11168820," implement all"
11168820,11169060," of these"
11169060,11169440," stats."
11169440,11169960," Right?"
11169960,11171240," We can try to"
11171240,11171940," implement all"
11171940,11172200," of these"
11172200,11172500," stats."
11172500,11175440," And also"
11175440,11176100," try to"
11176100,11176540," tweak"
11176540,11179180," our"
11179180,11179820," parameters,"
11179820,11180600," our initial"
11180600,11181020," parameters,"
11181020,11182220," so they"
11182220,11183100," somehow"
11183100,11183940," change the"
11183940,11184240," stats."
11184300,11184700," because right"
11184700,11184860," now,"
11184860,11185260," the stats"
11185260,11185580," are not"
11185580,11185800," really"
11185800,11186160," changing."
11186160,11188060," So,"
11188060,11188800," and I have"
11188800,11189100," a feeling"
11189100,11189560," that maybe"
11189560,11190060," this is"
11190060,11190940," because how"
11190940,11191740," we organize"
11191740,11192560," the genes"
11192560,11194840," because genes"
11194840,11196200," is a state"
11196200,11196620," machine."
11196620,11197540," Right?"
11197540,11198320," So,"
11198320,11199000," and what is a"
11199000,11199440," state machine"
11199440,11199780," actually?"
11199780,11200160," Let me,"
11200160,11201000," let me show"
11201000,11201180," you."
11201180,11205420," So,"
11205420,11205920," I feel like"
11205920,11206380," maybe with"
11206380,11206820," the state"
11206820,11207160," machine,"
11207160,11207500," it just"
11207500,11207900," doesn't"
11207900,11208600," really work"
11208600,11209400," that well"
11209400,11212740," because"
11212740,11213380," essentially"
11213380,11218720," you have"
11218720,11218980," a bunch"
11218980,11219140," of"
11219140,11219480," states,"
11219480,11220260," right?"
11220260,11220940," You have"
11220940,11221200," a bunch"
11221200,11221680," of states"
11221680,11223840," and also"
11223840,11226520," something"
11226520,11227000," like this."
11227000,11227680," So,"
11227680,11228300," sometimes"
11228300,11229380," you may"
11229380,11230040," have like"
11230040,11230900," clusters"
11230900,11232240," of states"
11232240,11232520," in the"
11232520,11232700," state"
11232700,11233040," machine"
11233040,11233440," that are"
11233440,11233620," not"
11233620,11234120," reachable"
11234120,11237000," and I'm"
11237000,11237280," not sure"
11237280,11237780," if mixing"
11237780,11238580," these things"
11238580,11239340," up is"
11239340,11239600," actually"
11239600,11239940," super"
11239940,11240320," helpful."
11240320,11241300," Maybe"
11241300,11241660," we need"
11241660,11242400," to make"
11242400,11242880," sure"
11242880,11243920," maybe"
11243920,11244200," we need"
11244200,11244440," to come"
11244440,11244660," up with"
11244660,11245220," an encoding"
11245220,11246420," that always"
11246420,11246920," makes like"
11246920,11247480," a connected"
11247480,11248040," graph of"
11248040,11248380," states."
11248380,11251580," But that's"
11251580,11252120," where they"
11252120,11252640," do not"
11252640,11253100," try to"
11253100,11253420," move at"
11253420,11253960," any point."
11253960,11254840," Yes,"
11254840,11255240," it is"
11255240,11255600," weird."
11255600,11256320," So,"
11256320,11257120," maybe we"
11257120,11257280," should"
11257280,11257920," try to"
11257920,11258420," inspect"
11258420,11259080," one of"
11259080,11259480," their"
11259480,11262540," state"
11262540,11262960," machines."
11263960,11264400," Yeah,"
11264400,11264620," let's"
11264620,11264820," actually"
11264820,11265160," try to"
11265160,11265280," do"
11265280,11265560," that."
11265560,11266160," Let's"
11266160,11266440," try to"
11266440,11267040," inspect"
11267040,11267520," one of"
11267520,11267640," the"
11267640,11267860," state"
11267860,11268180," machines."
11268180,11269240," Okay."
11269240,11272820," Collect"
11272820,11276180," some"
11276180,11276780," stats."
11276780,11278540," So,"
11278540,11278720," we're"
11278720,11279000," collecting"
11279000,11279320," some"
11279320,11279660," stats."
11279660,11283040," Also,"
11283040,11285240," inspect"
11285240,11292880," chromosomes"
11292880,11293780," of"
11293780,11294220," agents."
11294220,11294540," So,"
11294540,11294960," we'll"
11294960,11295240," have to"
11295240,11295400," create"
11295400,11295840," a special"
11295840,11296160," tool."
11296160,11298260," Why is"
11298260,11298540," the grid"
11298540,11299220," so large?"
11299220,11299920," Because there's"
11299920,11300240," a lot of"
11300240,11300720," cells there."
11303560,11304040," All right."
11304040,11304440," So,"
11304440,11304660," inspect"
11304660,11304800," them"
11304800,11306520," and I"
11306520,11306900," always"
11306900,11307220," have"
11307220,11307720," this"
11307720,11308620," strange"

11309320,11309440," of"

11309780,11309940," I"

11312480,11314380," Because I"
11314380,11314680," feel like"
11314680,11315120," maybe I"
11315120,11315580," fucked up"
11315580,11315720," the"

11401200,11401480," just"

11567300,11568160," is needed anymore"
11568160,11568820," so I might as well"
11568820,11569360," actually go"
11569360,11571960," just remove all of that"
11571960,11572960," hopefully"
11572960,11576440," yeah"
11576440,11577400," so make - B"
11577400,11578500," just to check if I didn't"
11578500,11579660," do a ""faki-waki"""
11579660,11580460," ""faki-waki"""
11580460,11581520," was not committed"
11581520,11585460," ""committed faki-waki"""
11585460,11588860," I like this phrase"
11588860,11590600," I don't know why"
11590600,11592620," somebody committed"
11592620,11593620," ""faki-waki"""
11594560,11597460," I'm gonna remove that"
11597460,11598020," I'm sorry"
11598020,11598520," you could look"
11598520,11606200," wait, what?"
11606200,11608700," do you see that?"
11608700,11610160," the"
11610160,11610960," oh, okay"
11610960,11611560," so"
11611560,11612400," ah, this is"
11612400,11613660," I thought you"
11613660,11615500," okay, I see"
11615500,11616360," it starts twerking"
11616360,11617900," I thought that was the answer"
11617900,11619060," of the bot"
11619060,11619720," hello, Adnan"
11619720,11620500," hello, welcome back"
11620500,11621700," yeah"
11621700,11623320," so I thought"
11623320,11624020," for some reason"
11624020,11624560," my brain thought"
11624560,11625660," you pinged the bot"
11625660,11626020," and the bot"
11626020,11626380," answer"
11626380,11627460," it starts twerking"
11627460,11628320," I don't know why"
11628320,11630260," sorry"
11630260,11631220," I think I'm getting tired"
11631220,11632560," alright"
11632560,11633660," so let's do"
11633660,11635060," commit"
11635060,11635660," remove"
11635660,11637060," dead code"
11637060,11639160," dead code"
11639160,11641420," welcome"
11641420,11642220," welcome back"
11642220,11643060," everyone"
11643060,11644860," alrighty"
11644860,11645580," so"
11645580,11646080," let's find the"
11646080,11646780," qsort"
11646780,11647920," qsort"
11649720,11649980," so"
11649980,11650660," how are we sorting"
11650660,11651280," everything"
11651280,11652180," how are we sorting"
11652180,11652880," everything"
11652880,11654220," uh-huh"
11654220,11654520," uh-huh"
11654520,11654860," uh-huh"
11654860,11657420," essentially"
11657420,11660360," the comparison function"
11660360,11661560," if I remember correctly"
11661560,11662460," qsort"
11662460,11664320," let's take a look"
11664320,11665620," compare"
11665620,11666460," compare"
11666460,11669280," the content of the array"
11669280,11669680," is sorted"
11669680,11671420," in ascending order"
11671420,11672780," according to a comparison"
11672780,11673380," function"
11673380,11675620," pointed by a compare"
11675620,11676620," which is called"
11676620,11677620," with the two arguments"
11677620,11677880," okay"
11677880,11678480," the compass function"
11678480,11679660," must return"
11679660,11680220," an integer"
11680220,11681080," less than"
11681080,11681680," equal to"
11681680,11682220," or greater"
11682220,11682840," than zero"
11682840,11684080," if the first argument"
11684080,11684720," is considered"
11684720,11685180," to be"
11685180,11685720," respectively"
11685720,11686180," less"
11686180,11687940," less than"
11687940,11689620," equal to"
11689620,11690480," or greater"
11690480,11691940," the first argument"
11691940,11694260," so that means"
11694260,11694980," we're essentially"
11694980,11695660," emulating"
11695660,11696980," a minus b"
11696980,11697600," situation"
11697600,11698100," right"
11698100,11699020," because in that case"
11699020,11699880," if this one"
11699880,11700860," is less than"
11700860,11701840," this one"
11701840,11702200," is going to be"
11702200,11702560," negative"
11702560,11703180," if they equal"
11703180,11703540," zero"
11703540,11704080," blah blah blah"
11704080,11704680," and that's why"
11704680,11705920," I actually reverted them"
11705920,11707180," so instead of a b"
11707180,11708640," I'm a minus b"
11708640,11709800," I'm doing b minus a"
11709800,11710940," and"
11710940,11712820," that kind of works"
11712820,11715360," that kind of works"
11715360,11716320," and"
11716320,11718780," let me"
11718780,11719520," try"
11719520,11720300," to"
11720300,11722720," actually check that"
11722720,11724120," one way to remember"
11724120,11725040," whether you're doing"
11725040,11725860," ascending or descending"
11725860,11726380," sorting"
11726380,11728440," with a and b thing"
11728440,11730960," I mean"
11730960,11732860," I don't need to remember"
11732860,11733640," I just derived"
11733640,11734800," the behavior myself"
11734800,11735600," like I just don't need"
11735600,11736240," to remember that"
11736240,11739040," simulator"
11739040,11741600," but thank you"
11741600,11742400," thank you"
11742400,11743780," thank you"
11743780,11750540," so I'm going to enable"
11750540,11751580," some of these things"
11751580,11752780," all right"
11752780,11753380," I'm going to enable"
11753380,11754380," some of these things"
11754380,11756160," this one is going to"
11756160,11757100," generate a new thing"
11757100,11759880," and when we do"
11759880,11761040," a next generation"
11761040,11772400," I also need a mode"
11772400,11774140," where"
11774140,11775460," you're not necessarily"
11775460,11776160," have to provide"
11776160,11777220," any input file"
11777220,11778700," for"
11778700,11780120," for this thing"
11780120,11781860," yes"
11781860,11782660," I think that's what"
11782660,11783200," I need here"
11783200,11785160," so I think the input file"
11785160,11786020," has to be optional"
11786020,11788740," I think the input file"
11788740,11789520," has to be optional"
11789520,11790160," because sometimes"
11790160,11790800," I just want to"
11790800,11791940," like start"
11791940,11792440," the"
11792440,11794200," the simulator"
11794200,11795580," and I want the simulator"
11795580,11796860," to come up with"
11796860,11798040," some random state"
11798040,11798800," not the state"
11798800,11799280," that is"
11799280,11800260," loaded from"
11800260,11800920," input file"
11800920,11802220," so"
11802220,11803820," I think I will have to"
11803820,11804640," change this behavior"
11804640,11805140," slightly"
11805140,11808100," so skip the program name"
11808100,11809140," if it's"
11809140,11810320," equal to zero"
11810320,11811140," that means"
11811140,11812260," we don't really have"
11812260,11813320," any input here"
11813320,11818920," so we'll also have"
11818920,11819900," to initialize"
11819900,11820760," this thing here"
11820760,11821700," so I mean"
11821700,11823000," the random number"
11823000,11823540," generator"
11823540,11825740," uh-huh"
11825740,11827580," okay cool"
11827580,11829000," so"
11829000,11831200," health"
11831200,11832560," we'll do it"
11832560,11833140," like that"
11833140,11835500," uh-huh"
11835500,11837720," but if it's"
11837720,11838540," not available"
11838540,11839860," we'll have to do"
11839860,11840900," init game"
11840900,11841660," right"
11841660,11842440," init game"
11842440,11844340," uh"
11844340,11845380," and it's gonna be games"
11845380,11846280," so it actually"
11846280,11847340," initializes like a"
11847340,11848000," random game"
11848000,11848980," hmm"
11848980,11850380," so when I think"
11850380,11851000," uh"
11851000,11852280," I want to also look at"
11852280,11854600," no input file"
11854600,11856040," let's put warning"
11856040,11858140," no input file"
11858140,11860700," is provided"
11860700,11862540," uh"
11862540,11863100," uh"
11863100,11863660," generating"
11863660,11865260," new"
11865260,11866860," generating"
11866860,11867500," new"
11867500,11869620," random state"
11869620,11870480," so it's gonna be"
11870480,11870940," like that"
11870940,11872500," so"
11872500,11873580," um"
11873580,11875980," and here"
11875980,11876620," we're gonna do"
11876620,11878460," something like this"
11878460,11880460," uh"
11880460,11881660," loading"
11881660,11882580," the state"
11882580,11883240," from"
11883240,11884260," uh"
11884260,11885460," here"
11885460,11888060," like this"
11888060,11889140," and the state"
11889140,11889800," is gonna be"
11889800,11891200," from input file path"
11891200,11893240," from the input"
11893240,11894060," file path"
11894060,11895480," let it go"
11895480,11897400," so hopefully"
11897400,11898180," that will"
11898180,11899220," do the trick"
11899220,11900400," uh"
11900400,11901700," and by the way"
11901700,11902260," the current"
11902260,11903140," in that case"
11903140,11903980," must be"
11903980,11904800," defined somewhere"
11904800,11905220," here"
11905220,11906340," before everything"
11906340,11907140," else"
11907140,11909300," uh-huh"
11909300,11917480," printf"
11917480,11917720," with"
11917720,11918100," uh"
11918100,11918640," yeah"
11918640,11919020," i see"
11919020,11920580," and when"
11920580,11921020," we dump"
11921020,11921540," in something"
11921540,11922280," uh"
11922280,11922600," i think"
11922600,11922880," i'm gonna"
11922880,11923220," remove"
11923220,11923440," this"
11923440,11923760," action"
11923760,11924000," this"
11924000,11924280," action"
11924280,11924580," is not"
11924580,11925060," really needed"
11925060,11925360," here"
11925360,11927700," section"
11927700,11928400," is not"
11928400,11928880," really needed"
11928880,11929080," here"
11929080,11929360," okay"
11929360,11930320," so"
11930320,11931120," essentially"
11931120,11931900," i can do"
11931900,11932720," gp simulator"
11932720,11933620," just like that"
11933620,11934680," and it will say"
11934680,11934980," warning"
11934980,11935800," no input files"
11935800,11936160," provided"
11936160,11936560," generating"
11936560,11937100," new state"
11937100,11938080," so that's"
11938080,11938520," exactly what"
11938520,11938820," happened"
11938820,11939480," the first"
11939480,11939880," state is"
11939880,11940440," even more"
11940440,11940800," like"
11940800,11941780," lively"
11941780,11942360," than"
11942360,11945460," yeah"
11945460,11946000," so what"
11946000,11946300," if we"
11946300,11946740," optimize"
11946740,11947680," the amount"
11947680,11948240," of steps"
11948240,11948780," instead"
11948780,11950780," like amount"
11950780,11951260," of steps"
11951260,11951640," that they"
11951640,11952120," performed"
11952120,11955720," yeah we can"
11955720,11956240," actually have"
11956240,11957160," several parameters"
11957160,11958720," did you simplify"
11958720,11959060," the logic"
11959060,11959380," by the way"
11959380,11959720," yes"
11959720,11960240," i did"
11960240,11960720," so"
11960720,11961360," um"
11961360,11964360," game.h"
11964360,11965700," and uh"
11965700,11966160," if i take a"
11966160,11966440," look at the"
11966440,11966740," amount of"
11966740,11967080," actions"
11967080,11967560," we don't"
11967560,11968520," have uh"
11968520,11969460," eat an"
11969460,11969760," attack"
11969760,11970120," anymore"
11970120,11970660," so it's"
11970660,11971500," only nothing"
11971500,11972380," step turn"
11972380,11972820," left and"
11972820,11973240," turn right"
11973240,11975480," so yeah"
11975480,11977680," it is in"
11977680,11978560," fact simplified"
11978560,11979720," so but now"
11979720,11980200," if i do"
11980200,11980660," something like"
11980660,11981060," simulate"
11981060,11981840," output"
11981840,11982440," pin"
11982440,11983380," it actually"
11983380,11983940," loading it"
11983940,11984220," for my"
11984220,11984640," outpin"
11984640,11985180," and this"
11985180,11985660," is the"
11985660,11986440," the pepega"
11986440,11986800," one"
11986800,11988360," all right"
11988360,11989300," it's a"
11989300,11989820," it's a"
11989820,11990440," the pepega"
11990440,11990700," one"
11990700,11992040," maybe the"
11992040,11992600," fittest"
11992600,11993160," function"
11993160,11993680," in our"
11993680,11994340," case could"
11994340,11994680," be a"
11994680,11995140," combination"
11995140,11996140," of how"
11996140,11996660," long they"
11996660,11997100," survived"
11997100,11998160," how many"
11998160,11998960," steps they"
11998960,11999220," made"
11999220,11999980," how many"
11999980,12000480," food they"
12000480,12000760," eaten"
12000760,12001520," and how"
12001520,12002080," many times"
12002080,12002580," they didn't"
12002580,12002960," attack"
12002960,12003980," so maybe"
12003980,12004440," we are"
12004440,12005400," optimizing the"
12005400,12005880," ones that"
12005880,12006420," can become"
12006420,12007200," very active"
12007200,12008180," right"
12008180,12009160," so and"
12009160,12011240," yeah"
12011240,12013380," committee"
12013380,12013760," committee"
12013760,12014280," yeah i need"
12014280,12014600," to do a"
12014600,12014820," committee"
12014820,12015220," committee"
12015220,12015980," because"
12015980,12016920," this kind"
12016920,12017320," of like"
12017320,12017820," a fittest"
12017820,12018280," function"
12018280,12018840," will produce"
12018840,12019120," some"
12019120,12019580," interesting"
12019580,12020020," results"
12020020,12022200," don't you"
12022200,12022560," encode"
12022560,12023560," that in"
12023560,12023940," health"
12023940,12024580," no i"
12024580,12025260," don't"
12025260,12025640," health"
12025640,12026440," is"
12026440,12027020," health"
12027020,12030260," i don't"
12030260,12030600," understand"
12030600,12031200," how i can"
12031200,12031720," encode it"
12031720,12032120," in health"
12032120,12032460," but"
12032460,12033600," all right"
12033600,12039700," so we're"
12039700,12039960," going to do"
12039960,12040220," committee"
12040220,12040600," committee"
12040600,12042020," make"
12042020,12043500," input"
12043500,12044200," file"
12044200,12045180," optional"
12045180,12046100," for"
12046100,12047300," gp"
12047300,12048640," simulator"
12048640,12049880," simulator"
12049880,12052640," and i'm"
12052640,12052840," going to"
12052840,12053320," push that"
12053320,12053920," right into"
12053920,12054060," the"
12054060,12054260," ripper"
12054260,12059060," at the"
12059060,12059420," end of the"
12059420,12059640," round"
12059640,12060020," health"
12060020,12060480," means how"
12060480,12060960," much food"
12060960,12061420," you ate"
12061420,12062740," like i don't"
12062740,12063260," want to decode"
12063260,12063880," that information"
12063880,12064520," i could probably"
12064520,12065140," decode all of"
12065140,12065620," that but"
12065620,12066100," why do i"
12066100,12066400," need to do"
12066400,12066700," that"
12066700,12077180," be careful"
12077180,12078540," for local"
12078540,12079160," means but"
12079160,12079420," we're not"
12079420,12079780," trying to"
12079780,12080120," optimize"
12080120,12080960," anything we're"
12080960,12081260," trying to"
12081260,12081760," have fun"
12081760,12084140," so yeah"
12084140,12097400," so what"
12097400,12097600," i was"
12097600,12097880," doing"
12097880,12098780," stats"
12098780,12100660," i checked"
12100660,12101060," the certain"
12101060,12101800," algorithm"
12101800,12103360," so i also"
12103360,12103700," wanted to"
12103700,12103980," have a"
12103980,12104260," like a"
12104260,12104680," tool that"
12104680,12105500," can inspect"
12105500,12106180," the chromosomes"
12106180,12106640," of the"
12106640,12107040," agents"
12107040,12110000," yeah let's"
12110000,12110440," actually try"
12110440,12110860," to implement"
12110860,12111140," that"
12111140,12113420," is this"
12113420,12113700," like a"
12113700,12114160," sophisticated"
12114160,12114560," game of"
12114560,12114740," life"
12114740,12115000," no"
12115000,12116580," check out"
12116580,12117760," projects"
12117760,12119020," check out"
12119020,12119960," playlists"
12119960,12120820," all of the"
12120820,12121640," watch all of"
12121640,12121940," the previous"
12121940,12122320," parts"
12122320,12124140," and yeah"
12124140,12124580," then we"
12124580,12124880," can talk"
12124880,12126000," all right"
12126000,12127460," i provided"
12127460,12127900," all the"
12127900,12128340," information"
12128340,12129220," necessary"
12129220,12129760," for you"
12129760,12130860," to get"
12130860,12131180," up to"
12131180,12131400," speed"
12131400,12137280," so yeah"
12137280,12137620," let's create"
12137620,12138140," like a"
12138140,12138800," special"
12138800,12139520," thing"
12139520,12140560," like"
12140560,12141180," inspector"
12141180,12142380," yeah"
12142380,12146980," so"
12146980,12147600," inspector"
12147600,12155500," there we"
12155500,12155700," go"
12155700,12156500," and"
12156500,12157420," soc"
12157420,12158040," gp"
12158040,12158960," inspector"
12158960,12161020," will there"
12161020,12161380," be part"
12161380,12161980," four"
12161980,12162840," looks like"
12162840,12163060," it"
12163060,12163960," looks like"
12163960,12164220," we're gonna"
12164220,12164660," have part"
12164660,12164940," four"
12164940,12166660," at some"
12166660,12167000," point"
12167000,12167540," i'm not"
12167540,12168100," sure when"
12168100,12169260," but it"
12169260,12169720," feels like"
12169720,12169980," we're gonna"
12169980,12170700," have it"
12170700,12185200," can you"
12185200,12185420," explain"
12185420,12185760," generally"
12185760,12186140," sure"
12186140,12186700," check out"
12186700,12187100," the project"
12187100,12187400," command"
12187400,12187840," and check"
12187840,12188120," out the"
12188120,12188360," playlist"
12188360,12188740," command"
12188740,12190280," so"
12190280,12191620," we also"
12191620,12192100," have all"
12192100,12192520," the previous"
12192520,12192980," parts for"
12192980,12193420," you available"
12193420,12195140," all right"
12195140,12196040," so"
12196040,12196720," let's"
12196720,12197080," continue"
12197080,12198500," it feels"
12198500,12198760," like"
12198760,12199200," like i'm"
12199200,12199640," using"
12199640,12200200," shift"
12200200,12201340," pretty much"
12201340,12201740," everywhere"
12201740,12203700," so i'm"
12203700,12204360," maybe i need"
12204360,12205340," to actually"
12205340,12207020," move that"
12207020,12208040," somewhere"
12208040,12208720," else"
12208720,12210520," but i don't"
12210520,12210880," know where"
12210880,12211880," how to call"
12211880,12212160," this"
12212160,12213220," thing"
12213220,12220540," all right"
12220540,12220820," i'm gonna"
12220820,12221300," copy paste"
12221300,12221720," it anyway"
12221720,12222720," so i"
12222720,12224620," i need"
12224620,12225040," to come up"
12225040,12225540," with a name"

12229600,12230200," with it"
12230200,12231340," hey"
12231340,12231500," it's"

12231940,12232300," yeah"
12232300,12232760," probably"
12232760,12241520," all right"
12241520,12242600," so printf"

12255300,12255940," the executable"
12255940,12256860," so usage"
12256860,12257660," it has"

12808720,12810400," who knows"
12810400,12811040," who knows"
12811040,12812580," um"
12812580,12815100," oh and by the way this one"
12815100,12817820," so we actually talk about like"
12817820,12822680," in terms of the bytes everything here is in terms of bytes so this is correct"
12822680,12823620," i think"
12823620,12825400," except"
12825400,12827780," okay this one is complicated because"
12827780,12828620," um"
12828620,12831360," yeah we have to be super careful"
12831360,12833260," um"
12833260,12835220," this is in bytes"
12835220,12837260," so that's why we do size of"
12837260,12838220," gin"
12838220,12839140," right"
12839140,12842740," but this one is not in bytes because it's like a pointer arithmetic"
12842740,12845800," so it has to be something like this size of"
12845800,12847020," uh"
12847020,12847460," gin"
12847460,12848980," there we go"
12848980,12851440," i think i think that now is"
12851440,12853280," this code is correct"
12853280,12854760," chat please tell me"
12854760,12856020," please tell me"
12856020,12857500," is this a correct code"
12857500,12858240," i think it is"
12858240,12860140," right"
12860140,12861920," because uh"
12861920,12863040," this thing is typed"
12863040,12864320," right this thing is typed"
12864320,12866420," so that means the pointer arithmetic is going to correct"
12866420,12872960," it compiles"
12872960,12875480," uh"
12875480,12877160," are you a case streamer you sound sad"
12877160,12878200," i'm a little bit tired"
12878200,12884660," and i got a little bit demotivated by the the bug that doesn't didn't produce anything"
12884660,12889420," uh and that's why it sounds so sad but i'm actually a little bit happier right now because"
12889420,12894040," we finally found the bug thank you so much everyone who suggested who helped me with this kind of"
12894040,12901140," stuff because my god i was going crazy inside thinking that i'm such a pepega that i cannot produce even something interesting"
12901140,12903500," all right"
12903500,12906020," so um"
12906020,12907680," this should be working now"
12907680,12912380," i want to recompile everything one more time and let's try to do a simulation"
12912380,12914600," p simulate"
12914600,12915860," uh"
12915860,12916780," gp simulate"
12916780,12919320," and uh we're gonna have 69 iterations"
12919320,12921820," and the output bin here"
12921820,12923200," now let's see what's gonna happen"
12923200,12925060," maybe something interesting is gonna happen"
12925060,12925780," go"
12925780,12929220," could not open file 69 really"
12929220,12931400," um"
12931400,12932620," what did we do"
12932620,12934620," loading state"
12934620,12935800," ah"
12935800,12936280," trainer"
12936280,12937560," excuse me"
12937560,12941520," okay"
12941520,12942320," three seconds"
12942320,12945780," all right"
12945780,12947120," it increased a little bit"
12947120,12950800," it's slowly increasing"
12950800,12953500," not really"
12953500,12954160," not much"
12954160,12956220," but"
12956220,12956800," uh"
12956800,12960220," hopefully"
12960220,12962100," maybe after that"
12962100,12963720," they're gonna become a little bit more interesting"
12963720,12966440," uh"
12966440,12967140," bless rng"
12967140,12967600," yes"
12967600,12969840," uh"
12969840,12971900," then it's decreasing"
12971900,12975560," they're just fluctuating"
12975560,12977980," let's actually"
12977980,12978840," you know"
12978840,12979320," uh"
12979320,12981080," let's have like 10 generations"
12981080,12982320," all right"
12982320,12983460," because uh"
12983460,12985560," we're testing whether we fix the bug or not"
12985560,12987020," so um"
12987020,12988440," yeah let's just have 10 generations"
12988440,12990600," and maybe that will produce something interesting"
12990600,12992380," um"
12992380,12996420," oh"
12996420,12996840," shit"
12996840,12997920," it went to four"
12997920,13008800," and it kind of takes longer time"
13008800,13011700," which hopefully means that they may be doing something"
13011700,13027780," okay so they're done i don't know what i was waiting for"
13027780,13029520," gp inspector"
13029520,13031360," so let's take a look at the gp inspector"
13031360,13032300," uh"
13032300,13033500," and"
13033500,13035040," okay"
13035040,13038500," this now doesn't look as sus anymore"
13038500,13039700," as before"
13039700,13042240," um"
13042240,13042840," so"
13042840,13044500," this looks like a legit"
13044500,13045840," uh"
13045840,13046680," legit thing"
13046680,13048480," and what's interesting is that"
13048480,13050100," we start at zero"
13050100,13051160," at zero state"
13051160,13053140," and the first thing at zero state"
13053140,13054200," if you see food"
13054200,13054200," if you see food"
13054200,13056360," you don't have to do actually anything"
13056360,13057600," and you have to switch to four"
13057600,13059420," and at state four"
13059420,13060620," if you see food"
13060620,13061860," you still have to do nothing"
13061860,13063040," but switch to state three"
13063040,13064640," and if it's state three"
13064640,13065420," you see food"
13065420,13066280," yeah"
13066280,13066600," so"
13066600,13067840," it's a really interesting"
13067840,13068920," combination"
13068920,13069280," but"
13069280,13070180," anyway"
13070180,13071840," so after the 10th generation"
13071840,13072660," let's take a look at"
13072660,13072900," uh"
13072900,13073520," what we have here"
13073520,13074380," so it's going to be"
13074380,13075200," a simulator"
13075200,13076500," output"
13076500,13080160," oh my god"
13080160,13081100," they're doing something"
13081100,13082620," they're actually moving a lot"
13082620,13084080," look at that"
13084080,13086140," they're actually doing"
13086140,13087120," they're doing things"
13087120,13088540," oh my god"
13088540,13089720," jesus fucking christ"
13089720,13090100," okay"
13090100,13091000," and"
13091000,13091720," look at that"
13091720,13093320," some of them survived longer"
13093320,13094240," oh"
13094240,13094660," shit"
13094660,13095460," it's fucking working"
13095460,13096700," oh thank you so much everyone"
13096700,13097360," oh my god"
13097360,13099640," i don't know what i would do without you"
13099640,13100160," seriously"
13100160,13101080," because sometimes"
13101080,13102800," i just get blind to"
13102800,13103600," to the problems"
13103600,13104740," it's such a simple"
13104740,13105940," like small problem"
13105940,13107460," that i did at the beginning"
13107460,13108000," of the stream"
13108000,13109120," i introduced that bug"
13109120,13110180," at the beginning of the stream"
13110180,13111640," oh my god"
13111640,13112380," thank you so much"
13112380,13112880," so"
13112880,13114320," 69 generations"
13114320,13116180," 69 generations then"
13116180,13118100," uh"
13118100,13119380," how about 69 of them"
13119380,13120580," so"
13120580,13121620," uh"
13121620,13122420," let's do 69"
13122420,13123700," and see how they're gonna perform"
13123700,13125540," um"
13125540,13128120," that's actually super cool"
13128120,13128980," uh"
13128980,13129440," maybe if the"
13129440,13130740," while they're performing"
13130740,13132160," i may commit"
13132160,13132940," uh"
13132940,13133740," some of the stuff"
13133740,13134900," um"
13134900,13135700," yeah"
13135700,13137160," so i'm gonna do"
13137160,13137880," a separate commit"
13137880,13138540," for inspector"
13138540,13140020," so here's the inspector"
13140020,13141100," and"
13141100,13141580," uh"
13141580,13142220," git ignore"
13142220,13143400," uh"
13143400,13144500," gp inspector"
13144500,13145140," so"
13145140,13148260," introvert pricey while training"
13148260,13149760," i don't know"
13149760,13150880," uh"
13150880,13151280," we'll see"
13151280,13152860," so git inspector"
13152860,13153760," blah blah blah"
13153760,13155440," mm-hmm"
13155440,13155940," mm-hmm"
13155940,13157760," um"
13157760,13160320," so"
13160320,13162460," introduce"
13162460,13163460," gp inspector"
13163460,13164500," gp inspector"
13164500,13165640," inspector"
13165640,13166200," inspector for"
13166200,13167500," inspecting"
13167500,13168500," dumps"
13168500,13169540," from gp"
13169540,13170020," trainer"
13170020,13171220," right"
13171220,13172120," and"
13172120,13173100," um"
13173100,13174380," all right"
13174380,13176500," fix"
13176500,13177420," nasty"
13177420,13179060," mating bug"
13179060,13182140," what the fuck"
13182140,13182940," what the fuck is this sentence"
13182940,13182940," what the fuck is this sentence"
13182940,13182960," what the fuck is this sentence"
13182960,13183020," what the fuck is this sentence"
13183020,13183460," what the fuck is this sentence"
13183460,13185160," what the fuck is this sentence"
13185160,13186360," what the fuck is this sentence"
13186360,13187040," what the fuck is this sentence"
13187040,13188040," what the fuck is this sentence"
13188040,13188440," what the fuck is this sentence"
13188440,13188540," what the fuck is this sentence"
13188540,13189040," what the fuck is this sentence"
13189040,13189040," what the fuck is this sentence"
13189040,13189140," what the fuck is this sentence"
13189140,13190940," what the fuck is this sentence"
13190940,13192040," what the fuck is this sentence"
13192040,13192980," what the fuck is this sentence"
13192980,13193980," increase increase"
13193980,13196040," all right"
13196040,13196720," i'm gonna push that"
13196720,13197960," everything to the repo"
13197960,13199840," feel free to test it out"
13199840,13201920," is that an std"
13201920,13206720," well std is actually"
13206720,13207900," i mean it's a virus"
13207900,13209040," right"
13209040,13209620," is it not"
13209620,13210960," i mean no"
13210960,13211900," std is just a"
13211900,13213080," it's a general thing"
13213080,13213920," for some reason"
13213920,13214940," i thought about aids"
13214940,13216220," aids is the virus"
13216220,13216760," right"
13216760,13219720," std is just a category"
13219720,13223300," all right"
13223300,13224320," so"
13224320,13225580," cool"
13225580,13226900," i think"
13226900,13227880," so we have"
13227880,13230480," 32"
13230480,13232440," 32nd generation"
13232440,13233920," hiv is a virus"
13233920,13234080," yeah"
13234080,13234880," oh yeah"
13234880,13236500," because aids"
13236500,13237540," can be caused"
13237540,13239020," not only by hiv"
13239020,13240220," that's why we have to"
13240220,13241300," separate the virus"
13241300,13243080," and the symptom"
13243080,13243680," right"
13243680,13244540," so there is a"
13244540,13245260," separate virus"
13245260,13245680," and there is"
13245680,13247000," separate symptoms"
13247000,13249540," i think"
13249540,13250800," i think it makes sense"
13250800,13268060," the time is slowly increasing"
13268060,13270680," so i wonder what's gonna happen"
13270680,13272820," if like we have thousands of generations"
13272820,13276080," won't they consume all the food"
13276080,13277300," yeah sure"
13277300,13279900," they will"
13279900,13284700," mem leak for the win"
13284700,13285780," we don't have a memory leak"
13285780,13287180," even a single one"
13287180,13288120," trust me"
13288120,13290520," we don't have a single allocation"
13290520,13293160," like not a single allocation"
13293160,13293740," is done"
13293740,13294660," like dynamic allocation"
13294660,13295580," in the whole source code"
13295580,13297040," so"
13297040,13298280," there's nothing"
13298280,13299700," there's literally nothing to leak"
13299700,13301040," stack leak"
13301040,13301280," yeah"
13301280,13306660," gene pool is still too small"
13306660,13307700," selection is too aggressive"
13307700,13308940," but it's already better"
13308940,13309960," than we had before"
13309960,13310420," so"
13310420,13312140," yeah i do realize that"
13312140,13312820," it's not perfect"
13312820,13313140," but"
13313140,13315380," it's my first time"
13315380,13317380," doing genetic programming"
13317380,13319580," and i didn't read anything"
13319580,13321620," any article about genetic programming"
13321620,13323500," except the definition of genetic programming"
13323500,13324400," on wikipedia"
13324400,13326540," cut me some slack"
13326540,13326840," okay"
13326840,13328720," i know it's not perfect"
13328720,13329420," i just wanna"
13329420,13331780," you know discover things"
13331780,13332620," myself"
13332620,13333520," you know"
13333520,13334620," come on"
13334620,13343000," stream reflexing"
13343000,13343960," i'm not really flexing"
13343960,13346120," i'm just asking for a little bit of slack"
13346120,13348260," because it's kind of hard"
13348260,13358160," use over cooking"
13358160,13359960," i don't"
13359960,13360520," i don't need"
13360520,13362040," sweet things"
13362040,13362820," i don't need sugar"
13362820,13363380," sorry"
13363380,13368380," all right"
13368380,13369080," so i think"
13369080,13370040," we're getting closer"
13370040,13370940," to something interesting"
13370940,13372040," 69th generation"
13372040,13372940," is actually getting"
13372940,13373620," very interesting"
13373620,13376660," do we have 99th chocolate"
13376660,13377280," yes i do"
13377280,13379000," maybe i deserve like a chocolate"
13379000,13380000," like a dark chocolate"
13380000,13380620," yeah sure"
13380620,13385560," you can even download"
13385560,13386620," the whole slack application"
13386620,13387000," yeah"
13387000,13388280," it's kind of cool"
13388280,13389140," that at the beginning"
13389140,13390200," it was like two seconds"
13390200,13391580," but now it's like getting"
13391580,13393120," like slower and slower"
13393120,13394660," and there we go"
13394660,13396180," i think we finally did something"
13396180,13397060," so simulation"
13397060,13398780," output bin"
13398780,13399560," and"
13399560,13401140," let's see what they do"
13401140,13403260," all of them are moving"
13403260,13404160," and doing things"
13404160,13406620," let's see who's gonna survive"
13406620,13408460," all of them are doing things"
13408460,13413080," oh shit"
13413080,13414160," they're eating food"
13414160,13416020," they're actually"
13416020,13417240," a lot of them"
13417240,13418760," are actually eating food"
13418760,13423640," well i think it's a fucking success"
13423640,13424480," i really like that"
13424480,13426840," okay"
13426840,13428060," so i actually generated"
13428060,13428820," the next generation"
13428820,13429980," just to see what's gonna happen"
13429980,13432880," you know"
13432880,13434020," let's actually change"
13434020,13434860," the visualization"
13434860,13437760," let's change the visualization"
13437760,13439720," game"
13439720,13441500," do they attack"
13441500,13442280," and drop food"
13442280,13443120," oh by the way"
13443120,13443820," i forgot to implement"
13443820,13444460," dropping food"
13444460,13446180," when they die"
13446180,13447460," shit"
13447460,13450720," would pthreads be hard"
13450720,13451340," to implement"
13451340,13452920," i don't know"
13452920,13454880," i never implemented pthreads"
13454880,13456960," cannibalism"
13456960,13457560," yes exactly"
13457560,13457780," oh"
13457780,13458140," anaboth"
13458140,13458380," hello"
13458380,13459360," welcome to the stream"
13459360,13461420," i haven't seen you in a while"
13461420,13462820," well i mean"
13462820,13464580," since the recent stream"
13464580,13465900," um"
13465900,13466560," yeah"
13466560,13468840," you guys use open mp"
13468840,13469800," yeah for sure"
13469800,13470940," and there's a lot of places"
13470940,13471680," where i could do"
13471680,13472840," make optimizations"
13472840,13474240," because i actually use"
13474240,13476180," a lot of linear lookups"
13476180,13477400," in arrays"
13477400,13478840," so"
13478840,13480620," the implementation"
13480620,13481240," is actually"
13481240,13482640," extremely fucking slow"
13482640,13483700," uh"
13483700,13484520," i just you know"
13484520,13485140," hacked together"
13485140,13485740," some stuff"
13485740,13486980," um"
13486980,13487820," and yeah"
13487820,13489480," i forgot what i was doing"
13489480,13490540," yeah i wanted to"
13490540,13491460," change the rendering"
13491460,13492640," so i have to go to"
13492640,13493060," visual"
13493060,13493860," render"
13493860,13495220," game"
13495220,13496520," right"
13496520,13498520," and i think"
13498520,13498940," i want to"
13498940,13500020," get rid of the"
13500020,13501240," dead things"
13501240,13502680," uh"
13502680,13503160," dead"
13503160,13503860," color"
13503860,13505320," so essentially"
13505320,13511220," yeah"
13511220,13513260," instead of"
13513260,13513700," color"
13513700,13514380," we're always"
13514380,13515480," always going to do"
13515480,13515880," uh"
13515880,13516320," agent"
13516320,13517560," agent"
13517560,13518000," alive"
13518000,13518300," color"
13518300,13519480," right"
13519480,13521440," and where do we call"
13521440,13522220," render agent"
13522220,13527580," if agent"
13527580,13529160," if game"
13529160,13530060," agents"
13530060,13531500," i"
13531500,13532640," health"
13532640,13534040," is greater than zero"
13534040,13534640," only then"
13534640,13535580," we're trying to render them"
13535580,13536600," otherwise they're dead"
13536600,13537620," all right"
13537620,13538300," makes sense"
13538300,13538980," uh"
13538980,13539660," makes sense"
13539660,13540360," compilation"
13540360,13541980," um"
13541980,13543820," so what's gonna do"
13543820,13545020," make minus b"
13545020,13545980," um"
13545980,13549880," make minus b"
13549880,13550520," and"
13550520,13551320," um"
13551320,13552200," oh my god"
13552200,13553300," this is so fucking fun"
13553300,13554380," especially when it works"
13554380,13555940," um"
13555940,13558300," so uh"
13558300,13558880," alive"
13558880,13559720," color"
13559720,13560360," we don't have"
13560360,13560820," we're gonna have"
13560820,13561300," dead color"
13561300,13562100," we're gonna only have"
13562100,13562660," these things"
13562660,13563400," so it's just an"
13563400,13564120," agent color"
13564120,13567720," just an agent color"
13567720,13579540," after"
13579540,13579560," after"
13579560,13581320," this small project"
13581320,13581780," is done"
13581780,13582440," after we have"
13582440,13582900," something"
13582900,13583720," more or less"
13583720,13584060," working"
13584060,13584640," i'm definitely"
13584640,13585240," gonna take a look"
13585240,13585800," at some of the"
13585800,13586680," existing articles"
13586680,13587860," about genetic"
13587860,13588260," programming"
13588260,13588840," and see"
13588840,13589520," what are the"
13589520,13590100," common approaches"
13590100,13590420," here"
13590420,13591300," i just want you"
13591300,13591640," to come up"
13591640,13592080," with something"
13592080,13592640," myself"
13592640,13594040," uh"
13594040,13594520," yeah"
13594520,13601660," p simulator"
13601660,13603220," not p"
13603220,13604300," but gp simulator"
13604300,13605180," like i look at"
13605180,13605880," this output"
13605880,13606900," and g is actually"
13606900,13607660," on the other line"
13607660,13608100," and i think"
13608100,13608980," it's p simulator"
13608980,13609700," my brain is so"
13609700,13610040," pepegan"
13610040,13611360," pp simulator"
13611360,13612860," okay"
13612860,13614500," um"
13614500,13616280," all right"
13616280,13617280," so now"
13617280,13618220," when they die"
13618220,13619380," uh"
13619380,13620100," they're gonna actually"
13620100,13621060," disappear from the"
13621060,13621780," from the board"
13621780,13623400," uh-huh"
13623400,13626640," so there will be"
13626640,13627560," like a whole wave"
13627560,13630700," uh-huh"
13630700,13631300," okay"
13631300,13635340," okay"
13635340,13635980," and they're slowly"
13635980,13636420," dying"
13636420,13638280," but a lot of them"
13638280,13639120," surviving at some"
13639120,13639440," point"
13639440,13639920," so"
13639920,13643800," i watched some"
13643800,13644460," videos a while"
13644460,13645140," back and"
13645140,13646400," they let it run"
13646400,13647380," for like 1 million"
13647380,13648580," iterations or more"
13648580,13649700," yeah"
13649700,13650860," probably makes sense"
13650860,13653820," okay"
13653820,13655200," so uh"
13655200,13655820," i think that's"
13655820,13656880," pretty pretty good"
13656880,13657640," so let me commit"
13657640,13657940," that"
13657940,13660060," um"
13660060,13661920," don't"
13661920,13662580," render"
13662580,13663420," dead"
13663420,13664580," uh"
13664580,13665260," bodies"
13665260,13667220," that's a nice"
13667220,13667820," commit message"
13667820,13668660," that rather dead"
13668660,13669000," bodies"
13669000,13670840," grab the"
13670840,13671260," lifetime"
13671260,13671480," time"
13671480,13672780," i haven't finished"
13672780,13673720," with what i wanted"
13673720,13674360," to do yet"
13674360,13675100," wait a second"
13675100,13677420," um"
13677420,13680860," yeah"
13680860,13681640," we need to add"
13681640,13683480," uh"
13683480,13684220," dropping foot"
13684220,13685020," make agents drop"
13685020,13685340," foot"
13685340,13686060," uh"
13686060,13687820," when they die"
13687820,13688720," so we need to do"
13688720,13689020," that"
13689020,13696440," other agent"
13696440,13697180," health"
13697180,13702860," food in front"
13702860,13703480," of the agent"
13703480,13703960," okay"
13703960,13706100," so if"
13706100,13707840," other agent"
13707840,13711220," is dead"
13711220,13713240," it should"
13713240,13713240," it should"
13713240,13713860," spawn"
13713860,13715080," uh"
13715080,13715560," food"
13715560,13717300," on that"
13717300,13717680," place"
13717680,13718500," but where"
13718500,13718880," that food"
13718880,13719300," is going to be"
13719300,13719660," located"
13719660,13720840," um"
13720840,13722380," where that food"
13722380,13722900," is going to be"
13722900,13723400," located"
13723400,13725180," so we need to"
13725180,13726020," find the cell"
13726020,13727000," in front of the"
13727000,13727800," in front of the"
13727800,13728180," agent"
13728180,13729780," uh"
13729780,13730020," yeah"
13730020,13730800," so this is how"
13730800,13731320," we do that"
13731320,13733640," uh"
13733640,13736600," so"
13736600,13737640," coordinate in front"
13737640,13738040," uh"
13738040,13738740," coordinate in front"
13738740,13739300," of the agent"
13739300,13740220," and we have an"
13740220,13740680," agent"
13740680,13741640," yeah so"
13741640,13742320," there you go"
13742320,13743360," uh"
13743360,13744300," and essentially"
13744300,13745660," oh"
13745660,13746000," shit"
13746000,13746540," we cannot really"
13746540,13747280," add a new"
13747280,13747700," food"
13747700,13750700," all right"
13750700,13751260," i think i"
13751260,13751960," have a better"
13751960,13752380," idea"
13752380,13753620," essentially"
13753620,13754440," uh"
13754440,13755480," by killing"
13755480,13756500," an enemy"
13756500,13758020," you also"
13758020,13758700," recover your"
13758700,13759060," hunger"
13759060,13759940," all right"
13759940,13760600," so that's"
13760600,13760920," going to be"
13760920,13761640," the solution"
13761640,13761980," here"
13761980,13763340," so you also"
13763340,13763900," recover your"
13763900,13764180," hunger"
13764180,13765940," um"
13765940,13768220," yeah"
13768220,13768900," that's the easiest"
13768900,13769360," way to go"
13769360,13769680," here"
13769680,13771460," instantly"
13771460,13776860," and maybe"
13776860,13777400," you also"
13777400,13778040," step"
13778040,13778760," forward"
13778760,13779400," because you"
13779400,13779880," managed to"
13779880,13780380," kill them"
13780380,13781100," right"
13781100,13781520," so you"
13781520,13782000," take their"
13782000,13782500," place"
13782500,13784500," um"
13784500,13786860," because you"
13786860,13787140," need to"
13787140,13787540," eat them"
13787540,13787960," so that's"
13787960,13788480," why you"
13788480,13789380," yeah"
13789380,13790300," that makes"
13790300,13790580," sense"
13790580,13791500," so you"
13791500,13792100," attack them"
13792100,13792540," but if"
13792540,13793060," they're still"
13793060,13793740," alive you"
13793740,13794340," don't move"
13794340,13794980," but if you"
13794980,13795720," actually manage"
13795720,13796140," to kill"
13796140,13796660," them like"
13796660,13797480," strike like"
13797480,13798400," the final"
13798400,13798780," blow"
13798780,13800020," uh"
13800020,13800800," you will also"
13800800,13801720," increase your"
13801720,13802300," hunger food"
13802300,13803120," recovery and"
13803120,13803940," then step"
13803940,13804320," forward"
13804320,13805220," i think i"
13805220,13805480," think it"
13805480,13805960," makes sense"
13805960,13807140," all right"
13807140,13808360," so uh"
13808360,13808820," let's try to"
13808820,13809360," recompile all"
13809360,13809840," of that and"
13809840,13810460," let's try to"
13810460,13811120," run a couple"
13811120,13811820," of generations"
13811820,13816160," yeah"
13816160,13816320," yeah"
13816320,13816440," yeah"
13816440,13816720," equal"
13816720,13817320," thank you"
13817320,13817740," thank you so"
13817740,13817900," much"
13817900,13818240," listener"
13818240,13818800," thank you"
13818800,13819060," thank you"
13819060,13820120," thank you"
13820120,13820800," um"
13820800,13823020," so and"
13823020,13823480," that will"
13823480,13824340," actually force"
13824340,13824800," them to"
13824800,13825600," optimize to"
13825600,13826340," attack as"
13826340,13826640," well"
13826640,13827360," because"
13827360,13828080," eventually"
13828080,13828620," they will"
13828620,13829200," run out"
13829200,13829600," of food"
13829600,13830580," so they"
13830580,13831140," will have"
13831140,13831580," to attack"
13831580,13832340," each other"
13832340,13833280," they will"
13833280,13833740," have to be"
13833740,13834120," forced to"
13834120,13834340," attack"
13834340,13834760," each other"
13834760,13836800," is it"
13836800,13837220," possible to"
13837220,13837680," visualize the"
13837680,13838120," training it"
13838120,13838740," is possible"
13838740,13839220," but i mean"
13839220,13839800," it will take"
13839800,13840340," some time"
13840340,13840920," right now"
13840920,13842880," uh so"
13842880,13844400," because a lot"
13844400,13845000," of things like"
13845000,13845620," just take too"
13845620,13846180," much effort"
13846180,13847460," i'm trying to"
13847460,13847960," come up with"
13847960,13848520," like super"
13848520,13849500," simple quick"
13849500,13850040," solutions"
13850040,13851740," okay so let's"
13851740,13852540," do training and"
13852540,13853180," let's just train"
13853180,13854320," for maybe 10"
13854320,13854880," generations"
13854880,13856520," right just 10"
13856520,13857260," generations and"
13857260,13857540," see what's"
13857540,13857940," going to happen"
13857940,13859800," um"
13859800,13867580," the more"
13867580,13868220," options for"
13868220,13868620," food they"
13868620,13869120," have the"
13869120,13869580," longer they"
13869580,13870060," survive"
13870060,13872540," actually so"
13872540,13872900," and since"
13872900,13873640," since they"
13873640,13874260," have each"
13874260,13875160," other as a"
13875160,13876000," option for"
13876000,13876420," the food"
13876420,13878680," uh yeah"
13878680,13879000," they will"
13879000,13879580," probably survive"
13879580,13880000," longer"
13880000,13881860," and it keeps"
13881860,13882240," dropping"
13882240,13883460," okay"
13883460,13885940," that's funny"
13885940,13888780," so you think"
13888780,13889060," it's going to"
13889060,13889600," be pepegas"
13889600,13890280," yeah it feels"
13890280,13890640," like they're"
13890640,13890760," going to"
13890760,13891440," become pepegas"
13891440,13892420," uh gp"
13892420,13892920," simulator"
13892920,13894940," uh all"
13894940,13895140," right"
13895140,13904620," now there's"
13904620,13905340," not that much"
13905340,13906020," of a pepegas"
13906020,13908580," uh"
13908580,13910120," oh thank you"
13910120,13910440," for the raid"
13910440,13910800," christian"
13910800,13911040," part"
13911040,13911600," uh"
13911600,13912680," power part"
13912680,13913540," uh and"
13913540,13914260," hello raiders"
13914260,13914960," uh welcome"
13914960,13916240," we're doing a"
13916240,13916900," little bit of"
13916900,13917360," genetic"
13917360,13917800," programming"
13917800,13921680," okay"
13921680,13923280," cool"
13923280,13924080," so 10"
13924080,13924520," generations"
13924520,13925000," were not"
13925000,13925780," as pepega"
13925780,13926440," as i would"
13926440,13927100," expect them"
13927100,13927440," to be"
13927440,13929160," so uh"
13929160,13929620," what's cool"
13929620,13930220," about simulation"
13930220,13930820," you can press"
13930820,13931900," n and you"
13931900,13932520," can continue"
13932520,13933020," training"
13933020,13934060," from the"
13934060,13934540," moment you"
13934540,13935040," picked up"
13935040,13935980," seriously"
13935980,13937340," so uh"
13937340,13937980," in in this"
13937980,13938380," simulator"
13938380,13939280," uh they"
13939280,13939840," all die"
13939840,13940200," and you"
13940200,13940580," can press"
13940580,13941160," n and it"
13941160,13941440," will give"
13941440,13941660," you the"
13941660,13941840," next"
13941840,13942360," generation"
13942360,13943440," um"
13943440,13944260," this is"
13944260,13944440," actually"
13944440,13944780," pretty cool"
13944780,13945980," so a simulator"
13945980,13946840," can also act"
13946840,13947520," like a trainer"
13947520,13948560," if you want"
13948560,13949240," to"
13949240,13950080," uh"
13950080,13952640," so that's"
13952640,13952980," yeah"
13952980,13953820," and the next"
13953820,13954280," generation"
13954280,13954920," again"
13954920,13957560," all right"
13957560,13958120," so let's"
13958120,13958640," actually run"
13958640,13959280," for maybe"
13959280,13960080," 100 generations"
13960080,13960620," this time"
13960620,13961180," i think"
13961180,13962240," can we survive"
13962240,13963040," 100 generations"
13963040,13964620," all right"
13964620,13966120," what programming"
13966120,13966760," software is"
13966760,13967060," this"
13967060,13967800," it's a"
13967800,13968200," just a"
13968200,13968560," playground"
13968560,13970360," for uh"
13970360,13971480," for genetic"
13971480,13971880," programming"
13971880,13972300," and stuff"
13972300,13972860," you can check"
13972860,13973140," out the"
13973140,13973400," project"
13973400,13973780," command"
13973780,13974740," also"
13974740,13976220," the previous"
13976220,13976740," streams on"
13976740,13977180," the topic"
13977180,13977820," and stuff"
13977820,13978380," like that"
13978380,13980520," uh"
13980520,13981760," 300 seconds"
13981760,13983560," 300 seconds"
13983560,13984320," is how many"
13984320,13984880," minutes is"
13984880,13985200," that"
13985200,13988060," i think"
13988060,13988560," it's five"
13988560,13988920," minutes"
13988920,13989400," okay"
13989400,13989780," let's wait"
13989780,13990340," five minutes"
13990340,13998180," does anybody"
13998180,13998520," have"
13998520,13998980," does anyone"
13998980,13999460," have any"
13999460,13999860," questions"
13999860,14000400," by the way"
14000400,14001800," do i need"
14001800,14002100," to commit"
14002100,14002480," anything"
14002480,14003660," yeah i do"
14003660,14003940," need to"
14003940,14004120," commit"
14004120,14004520," something"
14004520,14005960," um"
14005960,14007560," okay"
14007560,14008760," make agents"
14008760,14010060," recover"
14010060,14011080," their"
14011080,14012400," hunger"
14012400,14014340," when"
14014340,14014880," they"
14014880,14015620," kill"
14015620,14017020," somebody"
14017020,14017960," uh"
14017960,14018720," somebody"
14018720,14019960," there we go"
14019960,14020420," i'm gonna"
14020420,14020800," push that"
14020800,14020960," right"
14020960,14023000," what's your"
14023000,14023740," favorite virtual"
14023740,14024160," terminal"
14024160,14024600," emulator"
14024600,14025180," if i may"
14025180,14025580," ask"
14025580,14027140," i don't"
14027140,14027560," have any"
14027560,14028120," favorite virtual"
14028120,14028460," terminal"
14028460,14029040," i just use"
14029040,14029600," whatever works"
14029600,14030000," for me"
14030000,14031080," uh"
14031080,14032260," like i don't"
14032260,14033340," really focus"
14033340,14033980," on this kind"
14033980,14034380," of things"
14034380,14034960," right now"
14034960,14035320," i'm using"
14035320,14035920," uxvt"
14035920,14036920," but that's"
14036920,14037840," because that's"
14037840,14038320," the one"
14038320,14039000," that worked"
14039000,14039380," for me"
14039380,14040760," uh"
14040760,14041360," and yeah"
14041360,14042020," so"
14042020,14044380," oh would you"
14044380,14044900," look at that"
14044900,14045920," they went"
14045920,14046640," up to five"
14046640,14047220," seconds"
14047220,14048040," oh"
14048040,14048460," shit"
14048460,14049480," thanks"
14049480,14050080," you're"
14050080,14050380," welcome"
14050380,14050680," i guess"
14050680,14052200," i don't"
14052200,14052640," really like"
14052640,14053080," to focus"
14053080,14053620," on specific"
14053620,14054020," tools"
14054020,14054440," i just"
14054440,14054980," pick something"
14054980,14055460," that works"
14055460,14055900," for me"
14055900,14056980," uh"
14056980,14057540," and i just"
14057540,14058060," learn how"
14058060,14058440," to use"
14058440,14058620," it"
14058620,14060140," the most"
14060140,14060500," efficient"
14060500,14060860," way"
14060860,14062900," six seconds"
14062900,14063200," oh"
14063200,14063660," shit"
14063660,14064620," we need"
14064620,14065140," to implement"
14065140,14065920," like actually"
14065920,14066380," stopping"
14066380,14066920," generation"
14066920,14067440," and control"
14067440,14067900," c or"
14067900,14068280," something"
14068280,14071320," what's the"
14071320,14071600," genetic"
14071600,14071940," programming"
14071940,14072440," it's an"
14072440,14072820," optimizing"
14072820,14074060," solution"
14074060,14075180," uh"
14075180,14076540," by simulating"
14076540,14076920," nature"
14076920,14077780," so you"
14077780,14078100," essentially"
14078100,14078720," generate"
14078720,14079680," a range"
14079680,14080240," of solutions"
14080240,14081200," then you"
14081200,14081640," pick up"
14081640,14082100," the best"
14082100,14082440," ones"
14082440,14083660," and uh"
14083660,14084380," you mutate"
14084380,14084840," them a little"
14084840,14085060," bit"
14085060,14085820," you actually"
14085820,14086360," cross over"
14086360,14086640," them"
14086640,14087760," um"
14087760,14089060," and then"
14089060,14089760," generate a new"
14089760,14090120," generation"
14090120,14090500," again"
14090500,14091280," and you"
14091280,14091840," repeat that"
14091840,14092240," so you"
14092240,14092560," basically"
14092560,14093280," optimize a"
14093280,14093540," problem"
14093540,14093840," by"
14093840,14094280," natural"
14094280,14094780," selection"
14094780,14098380," cannibalism"
14098380,14098700," is good"
14098700,14099100," confirmed"
14099100,14099680," yes yes"
14099680,14100080," so they"
14100080,14100600," actually take"
14100600,14101440," look at"
14101440,14101760," that"
14101760,14102640," we'll be"
14102640,14103200," we'll be"
14103200,14103900," able to"
14103900,14106140," um"
14106140,14108700," how about"
14108700,14109180," adding an"
14109180,14109440," ata"
14109440,14110560," the problem"
14110560,14111140," with adding"
14111140,14111740," any features"
14111740,14112180," right now"
14112180,14112580," is that"
14112580,14113080," i have to"
14113080,14113460," stop the"
14113460,14113900," simulation"
14113900,14114740," and that"
14114740,14115080," means we'll"
14115080,14115380," have to"
14115380,14115880," start over"
14115880,14116200," again"
14116200,14117620," so uh"
14117620,14118080," once we"
14118080,14118580," started this"
14118580,14119120," entire thing"
14119120,14119700," i don't think"
14119700,14119980," we can"
14119980,14120280," easily"
14120280,14120780," stop it"
14120780,14122600," so uh"
14122600,14122920," yeah"
14122920,14124180," um"
14124180,14126440," let's wait"
14126440,14127060," i think it's"
14127060,14127560," not gonna take"
14127560,14127980," that much"
14127980,14128460," like 100"
14128460,14129000," generations"
14129000,14130040," like"
14130040,14133360," but yeah"
14133360,14134500," absolutely"
14134500,14135100," i never"
14135100,14135540," cared"
14135540,14136640," actually"
14136640,14136920," either"
14136920,14138280," until i was"
14138280,14138680," implementing"
14138680,14139020," one"
14139020,14140240," so i was"
14140240,14140660," just curious"
14140660,14141620," what other"
14141620,14142440," people's"
14142440,14143120," priority are"
14143120,14143720," but most"
14143720,14144280," seem to not"
14144280,14144800," have strong"
14144800,14145220," feelings"
14145220,14146160," to one"
14146160,14146160," to one"
14146160,14146720," or another"
14146720,14147340," yeah i"
14147340,14147800," think so"
14147800,14148960," because uh"
14148960,14149840," like terminal"
14149840,14150460," emulator is"
14150460,14150840," one of the"
14150840,14151320," things that"
14151320,14152300," you just"
14152300,14152980," forget about"
14152980,14154300," right so"
14154300,14155520," once you get"
14155520,14155940," used to a"
14155940,14156500," particular terminal"
14156500,14156980," emulator"
14156980,14158440," you don't see"
14158440,14158980," it anymore"
14158980,14159580," it like"
14159580,14160160," you know"
14160160,14160960," blends with"
14160960,14161540," your workflow"
14161540,14162280," that's why"
14162280,14162800," i don't think"
14162800,14163300," people have"
14163300,14164000," any particular"
14164000,14165580," um"
14165580,14166720," particular preferences"
14166720,14167300," and stuff like"
14167300,14167560," that"
14167560,14168220," do you"
14168220,14168560," always do"
14168560,14169000," crossover"
14169000,14169620," in my"
14169620,14170060," flappy"
14170060,14170680," flappy"
14170680,14171320," ai project"
14171320,14171660," i have"
14171660,14172040," a cross"
14172040,14172780," over"
14172780,14173120," odds"
14173120,14173540," variable"
14173540,14173820," that"
14173820,14174340," only does"
14174340,14174720," crossover"
14174720,14175560," only then"
14175560,14176100," otherwise"
14176100,14176900," just copies"
14176900,14177480," the best"
14177480,14177740," one"
14177740,14178880," i actually"
14178880,14179460," always do"
14179460,14179840," crossover"
14179840,14181200," basically"
14181200,14181920," i take"
14181920,14182520," the"
14182520,14183540," pool"
14183540,14184160," the"
14184160,14184940," selection"
14184940,14185260," pool"
14185260,14188080," and"
14188080,14189140," i generate"
14189140,14190020," the next"
14190020,14190460," generation"
14190460,14191300," by randomly"
14191300,14191820," selecting"
14191820,14192920," the parents"
14192920,14193700," for"
14193700,14194220," for the"
14194220,14194600," agents"
14194600,14195840," so"
14195840,14196580," yeah"
14196580,14202540," i like"
14202540,14202780," a word"
14202780,14203120," it just"
14203120,14203340," blends"
14203340,14203480," the"
14203480,14203660," work"
14203660,14203960," yeah"
14203960,14205140," i also"
14205140,14205420," think"
14205420,14206280," so"
14206280,14207400," the"
14207400,14207700," genetics"
14207700,14208080," pad"
14208080,14214880," yeah"
14214880,14215560," i also"
14215560,14216060," thought about"
14216060,14216220," it"
14216220,14217300," i also"
14217300,14217560," thought"
14217560,14217800," about"
14217800,14218160," actually"
14218160,14218840," i think"
14218840,14219160," i even"
14219160,14219680," said that"
14219680,14219920," like"
14219920,14220320," partially"
14220320,14221460," we need"
14221460,14221800," to parse"
14221800,14222360," you need"
14222360,14222660," to handle"
14222660,14223300," ctrl c"
14223300,14224100," and when"
14224100,14224520," you ctrl"
14224520,14224820," c"
14224820,14225180," it should"
14225180,14225440," save"
14225440,14225640," the"
14225640,14226060," last"
14226060,14227040," generation"
14227040,14236880," so"
14236880,14237320," we're"
14237320,14237800," already"
14237800,14238340," halfway"
14238340,14238840," through"
14238840,14240920," you can"
14240920,14241260," also do"
14241260,14241380," that"
14241380,14241620," okay"
14241620,14241980," yeah"
14241980,14242820," but"
14242820,14243260," again"
14243260,14243760," the problem"
14243760,14244080," with"
14244080,14245000," adding new"
14245000,14245260," features"
14245260,14245520," here"
14245520,14246020," is that"
14246020,14246620," i just"
14246620,14246880," have to"
14246880,14247160," stop"
14247160,14248560," what file"
14248560,14248980," is bin"
14248980,14249260," it's a"
14249260,14249460," binary"
14249460,14249880," file"
14249880,14250760," it basically"
14250760,14251300," contains"
14251300,14252180," the state"
14252180,14252560," of the"
14252560,14252960," generation"
14252960,14253320," it just"
14253320,14253720," contains"
14253720,14254120," the state"
14254120,14254360," of the"
14254360,14254780," generation"
14254780,14256160," and"
14256160,14257200," it doesn't"
14257200,14257540," have any"
14257540,14257860," particular"
14257860,14258360," format"
14258360,14258840," what i"
14258840,14259100," did"
14259100,14259600," i just"
14259600,14260040," took"
14260040,14260400," the"
14260400,14260780," memory"
14260780,14261340," that"
14261340,14262260," contains"
14262260,14262760," the state"
14262760,14262980," of the"
14262980,14263380," generation"
14263380,14264540," and dump"
14264540,14265220," that memory"
14265220,14265620," to the"
14265620,14266220," file system"
14266220,14268040," so that's"
14268040,14268360," what i did"
14268360,14269020," it was just"
14269020,14269380," the easiest"
14269380,14269880," way to"
14269880,14271120," just save"
14271120,14273420," the current"
14273420,14274220," state"
14274220,14275000," hello"
14275000,14275380," feng qi"
14275380,14275640," welcome"
14275640,14276080," welcome to"
14276080,14276360," the stream"
14276360,14276660," we're"
14276660,14277100," training"
14277100,14277640," our"
14277640,14278260," pepega"
14278260,14279320," agents"
14279320,14280820," so we're"
14280820,14281660," aiming for"
14281660,14282220," 100"
14282220,14282860," generations"
14282860,14283580," what we're"
14283580,14283860," optimizing"
14283860,14284260," right now"
14284260,14284760," we're optimizing"
14284760,14285360," their lifetime"
14285360,14286660," and by the"
14286660,14287040," way it"
14287040,14287360," actually"
14287360,14287760," working"
14287760,14293340," everything"
14293340,14293900," so"
14293900,14294400," right"
14294400,14295320," not really"
14295320,14295700," i mean"
14295700,14296580," i wrote"
14296580,14297060," a thing"
14297060,14297620," that didn't"
14297620,14297960," work for"
14297960,14298340," quite some"
14298340,14298560," time"
14298560,14298940," and i needed"
14298940,14299460," help from"

14301380,14301660," the fuck"
14301660,14302020," is going"
14302020,14302260," on"
14302260,14302680," so"
14302680,14303400," yeah"
14303400,14312720," so"
14312720,14312940," it"
14312940,14313260," started"
14313260,14313700," at"
14313700,14314740," three"
14314740,14315120," seconds"
14315120,14315480," and it"
14315480,14316020," doesn't go"
14316020,14316600," down to"
14316600,14317340," three seconds"
14317340,14318500," i wonder"
14318500,14318840," like"
14318840,14319440," probably"
14319440,14319960," after the"

14320240,14320640," chat"
14320640,14321000," probably"

14321640,14321960," what i'm"
14321960,14322280," gonna try"

14322640,14323260," i'm gonna"
14323260,14323800," try to"
14323800,14324360," like"
14324360,14325280," have like"
14325280,14325660," thousands"
14325660,14326360," of generations"
14326360,14326820," and maybe"
14326820,14327180," leave it"
14327180,14327540," overnight"
14327540,14328760," and just"
14328760,14329800," look at"
14329800,14330740," what the"
14330740,14331580," algorithm"
14331580,14332080," came up"
14332080,14332300," with"
14332300,14333040," and then"
14333040,14333300," we can"
14333300,14333600," take a"
14333600,14333860," look at"
14333860,14334080," the"
14334080,14334920," yeah"
14334920,14335560," 5k"
14335560,14336080," generations"
14336080,14336560," or something"
14336560,14336900," like that"
14336900,14337160," i'll be"
14337160,14337340," actually"
14337340,14337760," producing"
14337760,14339520," um"

14345780,14346440," shit"
14346440,14346980," they"
14346980,14348420," degradating"
14348420,14351220," they're"
14351220,14351440," actually"
14351440,14352020," degradating"
14352020,14352780," god damn"
14352780,14352980," it"
14352980,14354840," we're gonna"
14354840,14355380," get a"

14355660,14356300," generation"
14356300,14360820," maybe"

14361620,14362160," generation"
14362160,14362540," we should"
14362540,14362760," probably"
14362760,14363820," save it"
14363820,14364440," no"
14364440,14365120," that's"

14367820,14368160," something"
14368160,14368520," useful"
14368520,14368840," or"
14368840,14369080," just"
14369080,14369320," meme"
14369320,14370220," it's"
14370220,14370500," just a"
14370500,14370640," meme"
14370640,14371140," but also"
14371140,14371660," it's a"

14372480,14372760," cpu"
14372760,14374260," i know"
14374260,14374820," that it's"
14374820,14375100," hot"
14375100,14375520," i"
14375520,14376260," i know"

14379200,14379480," laptop"
14379480,14381600," i know"
14381600,14381800," it's"
14381800,14382360," very bad"
14382360,14383020," well"
14383020,14383760," i just"
14383760,14384220," don't have"

14384520,14384820," laptop"
14384820,14385200," i actually"
14385200,14385440," have"
14385440,14385700," another"
14385700,14386040," laptop"
14386040,14386480," but it's"
14386480,14386780," also"
14386780,14387460," actually"
14387460,14387960," heats up"
14387960,14388400," like that"
14388400,14389280," so"
14389280,14391740," i don't"
14391740,14392020," have a"

14392560,14392840," sorry"
14392840,14395340," i don't"

14395880,14400100," so"
14400100,14400420," what was"

14400740,14401800," they're"

14404720,14404920," they"
14404920,14405200," become"

14412380,14413400," yeah"
14413400,14414480," i think"
14414480,14414860," implementing"
14414860,14415200," like a"

14415660,14416040," support"
14416040,14416440," would be"

14417020,14417520," and"
14417520,14417900," also"

14427920,14429280," yes"
14429280,14429620," i think"
14429620,14429780," that"
14429780,14429900," would"
14429900,14430020," be"

14431540,14431860," yeah"
14431860,14437100," and"
14437100,14437380," also"
14437380,14437660," maybe"

14438520,14439920," training"
14439920,14440360," we should"

14446240,14446620," then"
14446620,14446880," go"
14446880,14447320," back"
14447320,14447520," and"
14447520,14447840," check"

14466240,14466520," on"
14466520,14466920," graphics"
14466920,14467220," next"
14467220,14467500," yeah"
14467500,14473040," we'll"
14473040,14473340," see"
14473340,14475820," what's"
14475820,14475920," the"
14475920,14476260," population"
14476260,14476540," side"
14476540,14476840," i think"

14477340,14481340," after"
14481340,14481680," it's"
14481680,14481960," done"
14481960,14482320," we can"
14482320,14482660," actually"
14482660,14483280," simulate"
14483280,14483680," the"

14484460,14485520," and"
14485520,14487600," see how"
14487600,14488060," they behave"
14488060,14489620," so"
14489620,14490740," we probably"
14490740,14491080," will need"
14491080,14491400," to have"
14491400,14492300," the fourth"

14494160,14495200," stuff"
14495200,14495420," like"
14495420,14495700," that"
14495700,14497700," because"
14497700,14497960," this"
14497960,14498080," is"
14498080,14498340," actually"
14498340,14498920," fascinating"
14498920,14499380," my"
14499380,14499640," gut"
14499640,14502240," and"
14502240,14502380," I'm"
14502380,14502740," surprised"

14505180,14505720," actually"
14505720,14506120," worked"
14506120,14506320," I"
14506320,14506500," didn't"

14509320,14509500," it"
14509500,14510520," worked"
14510520,14511240," it"
14511240,14511480," straight"
14511480,14512080," worked"
14512080,14513140," we're"
14513140,14513340," almost"
14513340,14513600," there"
14513600,14514060," this"
14514060,14514180," is"

14525240,14525420," there"
14525420,14525520," we"
14525520,14525700," go"
14525700,14526660," so"
14526660,14527080," and"
14527080,14527320," let's"
14527320,14527480," take"
14527480,14527620," a"
14527620,14527800," look"
14527800,14528200," at"

14533060,14533360," bin"
14533360,14533860," okay"
14533860,14534180," here"
14534180,14534300," they"
14534300,14534700," are"

14542560,14542840," it's"
14542840,14543060," funny"
14543060,14543420," how"
