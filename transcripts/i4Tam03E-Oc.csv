0,5500," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session with Mr. Zodin."
5500,9060," So today I would like to continue something that I studied in the previous stream which is"
9060,16620," re-implementing Raylib in JavaScript. To be fair the goal of the project is not as ambitious as"
16620,22600," it sounds right so essentially for those who doesn't know Raylib is a game library right so"
22600,28600," and it's written completely in C so it's it's for writing games in in pure C and I was not"
28600,35620," particularly satisfied with the way it is ported to web there's nothing particularly wrong with the"
35620,41200," approach they use they rely completely on Emscripten right and it's sort of like a cover everything"
41200,47300," approach right so essentially Emscripten just like literally re-implements the entire POSIX layer"
47300,55420," which makes it super quick to port existing POSIX applications to just web but the the end result"
55420,62260," is very bloated and very janky right but if you don't care it's fine so unfortunately I do care"
62260,70200," right and what I decided to do I decided is to see how difficult or easy it is to implement a small"
70200,77900," subset of Raylib API in JavaScript so you can use it directly from WebAssembly written in C"
77900,82700," without Emscripten for more context I really recommend you to watch the previous stream is the"
82700,87440," link is going to be in the description right so there's the full context in there but what essentially"
87440,93680," this library facilitates will try to facilitate it's not even you know well implemented yet there is not"
93680,99920," that many things implemented there so what it facilitates it facilitates the sort of like a this"
99920,108760," simple style of C programming for WebAssembly without Emscripten so this is a style of programmer programming"
108760,116240," of its own right so it's not really that well known but it's a very cool style which results in a simpler"
116240,121480," and in my opinion more maintainable software because it doesn't depend on too many moving parts that can"
121480,126840," break at any point right so if you want to learn more about this kind of stuff I recommend"
126840,137060," googling up C web assembly without Emscripten right and so there is one article like a really good"
137060,143380," article that basically summarizes how you generally do that right so and I'm going to give that article"
143380,150480," to people in chat and of course people on YouTube who's watching on YouTube I'm going to put it in the"
150480,156840," description of course it's going to be there so let's take a look at what we've got so far what"
156840,165820," we've got so far so essentially we've got a very simple game right it's written in Raylib it actually"
165820,174420," it is compilable with Raylib so I think I actually removed the Raylib library from here so let me quickly"
174420,180380," maybe bring the Raylib library back so I can actually demonstrate you that this particular"
180480,189680," game is actually native right so you can run it on a native machine so this is going to be game and"
189680,200840," the game depends on game c lib raylib.a which is this thing and then we do clank game game.c not"
200840,207880," gaming gaming game.c and essentially we're going to link with Raylib and what's going to be the next"
207880,212740," thing so the the math library so this is one of the things we definitely need to have in here let's try to"
212740,216940," compile this entire thing so it's compiling for web right so it compiles it to web assembly but it's not"
216940,224600," that interesting and Raylib header is not found so let's actually you know add include path called"
224600,231840," include right and I'm going to rebuild probably only the game uh right so it could not find the library"
231840,236440," this is because we need to add the library path hopefully now it found the library and if you try to"
236440,242620," run this game so you have the bouncing circle right as you can see it's a native application it's a native"
242620,248580," application that doesn't in fact work outside of the browser so and there's a second second compilation"
248580,255180," line which compiles this entire thing to web assembly right if I do game.wasm right game.wasm"
255180,260620," so this is not really what I want to do I want to do making here instead uh it's already up to date"
260620,266380," right so and what it does it generates this wasm module it's actually a very small wasm module it's"
266380,273400," all like less than two kilobytes right just less than two kilobytes on a scale of web how much is that"
273400,277380," right so we have hello worlds that are measured in megabytes"
277380,285140," and essentially what we did we looked through what functions what Raylib functions we use in here"
285140,290180," right things like begin drawing clear background and stuff like that and we literally implemented"
290180,295760," them in javascript right so we literally implemented them in javascript so here is the list of these"
295760,301220," functions so that c program compiled to web assembly will be calling to these javascript functions"
301220,307140," right so the game doesn't really know where exactly it is running it doesn't know where it's running natively"
307140,314420," in linux or on windows or in a browser it literally has no idea uh right so and now we have to start"
314420,320280," the server right so because if you're fetching web assembly modules you have to do that through a server"
320280,325540," because of the course uh like you know restrictions and stuff like that so uh it's going to be https"
325540,331860," server 69 or 69 and we're going to go into localhost look at that and it is working there"
331860,339140," it is working there and we're not using the official Raylib web support and we're not using mscripten"
339140,344260," again and we managed to implement that i suppose within like two hours on the previous stream"
344260,351620," i think it was like around two hours uh the whole setup and everything prototyping and uh it now works in there"
351620,358740," and the whole thing right so the library itself is 3.5 kilobytes right a small subset of Raylibs so the"
358740,367140," the game itself is two two hundred two kilobytes and uh html is just like 359 bytes so the whole thing"
367140,372820," right so i really like these uh simple things because they don't again don't have that many moving parts"
373380,381140," um so people quite often like don't understand why i care about complexity or simplicity of the"
381140,387780," application if you can just add a little bit more bloat and get to the market faster that's"
387780,394500," the argument i constantly hear all the time so um sure i'm not a market person i'm a software engineer"
394500,400660," first of all i'm a software engineer and i devoted my life to making software systems and here's an"
400660,407380," interesting thing the part of software engineering the part of software engineering is also planning"
407380,414980," software development planning software development here's an interesting thing about um simpler systems"
414980,422020," uh the simpler the systems are the less moving parts they have the more predictable their development"
422020,429460," will be because you will have less problems that you do not anticipate you may have"
429460,435060," uh like a fair amount of problems you may have a fair amount of problems that may scare away"
435060,441540," some people but what if all of these problems are predictable think about that so imagine you have"
441540,449060," a fair amount of problems but each individual problem is solvable and predictable think about that"
450100,454100," that is actually super cool because now you can plan it"
454100,461380," but now like if you are going into more complicated systems now you have first of all"
461380,466420," unknown amount of problems and you can't predict them you can't plan them"
466420,473620," so it becomes more difficult more frustrating and maybe even more expensive over a long time"
476180,481300," it will be interesting to do some sort of research in that i know but yeah as a software engineer that's"
481300,488180," why i care about simpler systems they are maybe a little bit more difficult to do to develop"
488180,493940," perceptually it may feel like they have more problems but if each individual problem that you"
493940,499940," encounter is actually predictable and you can account for and predict that it will happen you can plan"
499940,506740," and now the whole thing is actually controllable you are in control of the project where if your um"
506740,512660," software depends on a ton of different libraries and different apis each of them can break at any point"
512660,524100," you are no in control of anything you can get up at any moment so yeah that's basically my sort of view on"
524100,530020," software development uh essentially that's sort of my view anyways"
530020,538020," so and what i'd like to do today uh i would like to take"
538020,546020," some of the official raylib examples some of the official raylib examples and uh try to port them to"
546020,553060," raylib.js right it's probably not going to be possible because raylib.js implements again a very small subset of um"
553060,561940," um of the api but that's going to be an opportunity to actually extend the implementation of the api if"
561940,568100," you know if you know what i'm talking about right so we're sort of like treating this entire source code"
568100,575380," as the model and we're using examples as the training data set and we're doing gradient descent major"
578580,585940," yeah that's kind of interesting uh and this is kind of funny because i think if we're going to be having"
585940,591940," like an ai that actually code uh right that actually does a good job at software development"
591940,601620," i think it's not going to be um a language model right a pre-trained language model because software"
601620,610820," development by its nature is training a model right it is training the model so the thing that codes"
610820,617540," must be meta optimizer that's what it needs to be right because i said that multiple times that"
617540,625380," software development software development your code is the model model like machine learning model your"
625380,633140," requirements is the data on which you're training that model and you are the optimizer you're manually"
633140,638980," doing recursive descent to weaken the parameters of the model so it fits the requirements so if we're"
638980,645300," going to have a thing that codes instead of humans it's going to be this optimizer so the the essentially"
645300,652580," you can think of gradient descent as the coder for a very simple model of um you know of a neural network"
652580,657700," or something like that all right so i think that's the way to go if we want to automate coding"
657700,663700," in that regard uh right but then we'll have to come up with the language that specifies the requirements"
663700,670740," for the for the meta um you know meta optimizer to to to do and how we're going to call this uh language that"
670740,675140," describes the requirements we're probably going to call it a programming language and people who write"
675300,679860," the requirements are going to be programmers"
679860,693940," anyway cheers so that development isn't marvelous"
693940,704020," so all right let's go into uh you know raylib examples right so let's actually go to the"
704020,708420," ray san ray sama"
708420,725300," so i suppose there is a lot of different examples for different sort of like sub modules of raylib"
725300,732180," right so and the main module is called core uh so and i suppose that's what we're interested in so we have a"
732180,740020," we have a camera 2d uh we have a camera 3d core basic screen manager core basic window so there is a"
740020,747700," screenshot congrats you created your first window uh that's pretty cool so i mean we already have an"
747700,757620," example that is more complicated than that so maybe we can have a frame control maybe we can have a frame"
757620,768740," control so that's very interesting so you know raylib uses this sort of like text rendering everywhere with"
768740,777140," its custom font so maybe it is going to be very beneficial to actually implement a thing that does that because"
777140,782980," it's sort of like the basic uh rendering of the text so because of that i think we we should start with the core"
782980,789380," basic window right so what that's what we should start with core basic window and in here we have a"
789380,798260," thing called draw text and uh everything so light gray so shut the fuck up github get the fuck out of here"
798260,804100," uh so i'm sorry so and yeah let's go ahead and just download this thing"
805540,814500," um so this is the raw thing and uh maybe we're gonna have examples right so this is an example"
814500,822340," and i'm gonna download that example raw i'm raw downloading that thing so does it have a license"
822340,828660," i suppose it does in fact has a license right but i mean it has a copyright uh i'll need to not forget to"
828660,835700," like add the licenses for raylib um so these are the headers right and the headers already contain the"
835700,842900," license i suppose yeah here is the license but i'm not sure what license is the examples uh oh it's a"
842900,851060," it's a bsd bsd like license examples under modified zlib uh which is uh okay so the the license is is"
851060,856340," there all right so i'm not violating anyone's copyright right so i'm not stripping off anyone's name so it's"
856340,861540," it's just like all of that belongs to to rayson uh i'm just like borrowing it for for my purposes"
861540,868580," anyways so let's actually go ahead and um try to implement the compilation so we're going to have"
868580,878340," examples and the first example we're going to have is uh core blah blah blah this thing so core basic"
878340,884420," window core basic window and the thing i want to do i want to actually build it as a native application"
884420,892260," first to confirm uh that you know the entire thing right now compilable on my machine so this is going"
892260,899140," to be that and this is how we build the whole thing okay so something doesn't work in here so this is how"
899140,907700," we build the whole thing i can even copy paste this entire stuff boom boom boom so core basic window there we go"
908660,916420," um so let me just go ahead and make that specific thing so there's no such file because i'm a dummy dumb"
916420,923940," dumb i suppose to prefix this entire thing with example so are you happy now uh yeah i suppose to"
923940,931220," prefix it in here examples there we go so that seems to be working that seems to be twerking core basic window"
931220,938420," there we go can you see the text okay congrats you created your first window"
938420,945140," okay looks cool okay looks cool uh now"
945140,955300," flashbang yeah exactly flashbang so now what we need to do we need to actually create a wasm module of this"
955300,962420," entire thing right so i suppose it's going to be located in wasm right so wasn't uh and uh how we're"
962420,968260," going to be doing all that i suppose i'm going to copy paste this entire stuff and uh i'm going to simply"
968260,981060," replace game with core basic window uh actually yeah core basic window core basic window game.c uh-huh"
981060,992740," core basic window core basic window okay so now i'm gonna go ahead and simply build that specific thing uh needed"
992740,1000580," by uh core dot c oh it's part of the examples of course i forgot to do the i did a fucky walkie yet"
1000580,1007060," again um so this one is also part of the examples as far as i know makefile has some sort of like um"
1007060,1014340," you know patterns uh right so which allows you to reuse some of the uh some of the rules and stuff like"
1014340,1018980," that but i don't know how cross-platform the entire thing is okay so we managed to create a"
1018980,1023380," wasm thingy and here is the wasm module it's actually smaller than the game because it doesn't"
1023380,1032020," really do that much uh yeah it's worse than the regex i do quite remember that i kind of remember that"
1032020,1039300," so um so let's actually try to run this entire thing oh by the way by the way uh somebody recently"
1039300,1045860," submitted a pretty cool pull request for for raylib uh so i suppose i want to actually fetch that uh super"
1045860,1050500," quick and merge this into i think i don't know if it's going to be like a merge conflict but probably"
1050500,1057060," not uh yeah there we go so there was no conflicts or anything like that so essentially uh what they"
1057060,1066020," did they added a check whether we are online or not and if you just open the thing um from the file"
1066020,1071460," system it will tell you just run it through the browser so that's what they basically added uh all right"
1071460,1076180," so uh we can even take a look at how it looks like right so if i do chromium and i open it up"
1076180,1080420," like that so as you can see unfortunately due to course restriction uh the wasm assembly cannot be"
1080420,1085940," fetched to do blah blah blah just do that if you want to run it uh right and if you open it in here"
1085940,1091380," uh right so it is working it is in fact it's working so let me actually open devtools and refresh"
1091380,1097940," this entire thing uh right just to make sure that the the cache is updated and yeah so i also recently fixed"
1097940,1104100," a thing where you just switch off from the thing and go back and it doesn't go you know crazy so"
1104100,1109140," the reason why it was going crazy when you switch between the tabs is because uh you know the sketching"
1109140,1115940," of the frame stops so the animation cannot continue working right so what we do is that we just don't"
1115940,1121540," allow delta time to be super big and we effectively skip the frames right so effectively skip the frames"
1121540,1127700," if it's too big right for now for demos for demos it is fine it's a sort of like a stopgap solution"
1127700,1130820," uh right so but maybe in the future we're gonna come up with something better"
1130820,1141860," to be fair to be fair i feel like this approach uh is not going to replace array leap completely"
1141860,1149460," it is not going to replace ready completely but it's going to be uh for the situations when you care about"
1149460,1155220," the simplicity of your setup and you don't use the entirety of the ready because i don't believe"
1155220,1161460," that we can implement the entirety of the ready using that uh right so essentially you have a simple"
1161460,1168340," game that you want to quickly port to web uh right and you don't use anything like you use only the apis"
1168340,1172820," that we implement in here and you can just slap this thing in here and it kind of works and i also want"
1172820,1178180," this thing to be super simple and minimal and hackable to the point that uh the way to use it is just"
1178180,1185220," copy-pasting this js script and maybe even hacking it and just adjusting something there right so i"
1185220,1189460," really like this kind of libraries and these kind of systems this is one of the reasons why i like"
1189460,1195620," uh ray leap itself by the way ray leap is one of these things which you can literally copy-paste into"
1195620,1200980," your project and modify something in there and also stb libraries right so i really like this kind of"
1200980,1206340," approach to the libraries where the whole setup is just copy-pasting a single file and the file is so"
1206340,1211540," goddamn simple you can look into it you can read it you can fully understand it and maybe modify it"
1211540,1219860," according to your needs right so because that way you become in control of the dependency so why is it"
1219860,1223860," important people quite often like a newer developers don't understand why it is important to be able to"
1223860,1229700," modify your dependencies because you're taking control of them right and if you control your dependency"
1230340,1234340," you can plan you encounter less problems so"
1234340,1240420," in enterprise development we call it vendoring yeah"
1241140,1243700," i know that i know that i worked in enterprise software development"
1243700,1257620," so people often think that i am the way i am because i never worked in enterprise and don't know how"
1257620,1267300," the real world works no my friends i am like that precisely because i worked in enterprise precisely"
1267940,1270500," i'm fucking telling you so"
1270500,1274580," so"
1274580,1287140," all right all right all right all right all right all right um so let's maybe go ahead and try to"
1287140,1294500," run this application uh right so the the example in ray deep so the problem that we have right now is"
1294500,1299940," that the game is hard coded right so how do we fetch that so here is the fetch and as you can see it is"
1299940,1308340," in fact straight up hard coded uh right if i go to here uh right so where is the wasm uh let's quickly replace"
1308340,1316020," this wasm module and see uh if it's going to work right so i'm gonna go to the consoles and i'm gonna refresh"
1316020,1324260," the whole thing uh right so yeah this is the first thing to be able to use uh raylib.js your application"
1324260,1330660," has to be organized in a certain way right it has to be organized in a certain way so essentially you"
1330660,1337380," have to export three functions uh game frame which renders the single frame game init and game over right"
1337380,1343620," right gaming it initializes the game it does init window and blah blah blah uh and then game over uh"
1343620,1349540," you know finalizes the window and right you need to have this kind of thing right so essentially for"
1349540,1355780," uh the native uh for the native part you are organizing the loop yourself right you organize"
1355780,1362820," the loop yourself and in the web the loop is called for you right so by by this system so as far as i know"
1362820,1370420," like mscripten version of raylib is capable of using something called as a syncify i wonder if at some"
1370420,1375540," point we'll manage to implement something similar so you can just like straight up compile the thing as it is"
1375540,1383860," so um maybe make something similar to mscripten does a set main loop thing i'm not really sure how exactly"
1383860,1390820," to do that with the current approach right so because we're going to be passing the pointer to a function"
1391700,1401540," um through to to a javascript so how exactly is it going to work right so that's the interesting"
1401540,1407940," question right so i'm passing the pointer to to a function to javascript how javascript is going to"
1407940,1418340," see that at all i have no idea honestly i have no idea we can try to maybe see that right we can try to see that"
1419300,1426580," so essentially uh i'm gonna say that i expect from a javascript to have a function something like"
1426580,1433620," set uh entry right so and it's going to accept the pointer called entry which is just a pointer to a"
1433620,1442100," function uh right and in here we can have some sort of entry uh which maybe does something right which"
1442100,1448420," maybe does something and uh maybe calls to another function right something like print message"
1448420,1460100," uh right const char message and uh we can say something like hello from entry hello from entry"
1460100,1464980," so and essentially in gaming it in gaming it what we're going to do"
1466100,1475700," we're going to do set entry entry right so anything i want to do i want to see what exactly entry is"
1475700,1482500," going to be from the point of view of um you know of javascript right so from the point of view of"
1482500,1488500," javascript so we can try to compile uh game.wasm right so let's compile game.wasm right so let's go to the"
1488500,1494260," compilation errors of course uh right so that's quite important okay that seems to be working uh that seems to be"
1494260,1503700," working so let's go to uh radib.js and replace the wasm module back right so this is going to be game"
1503700,1509780," wasm and let's refresh the whole thing so set entry point returned one"
1509780,1518580," it literally returned one but that's not the whole story honestly i do not believe that this is a whole"
1518580,1527700," story we also need to take a look at the module that we've gotten here because maybe now uh the wasm module"
1527700,1535860," imports some interesting tables so essentially in wasm there is a thing called tables right this is"
1535860,1543060," something that i never used in web assembly but they're there and as far as i know tables hold uh"
1543060,1549140," pointers to functions or something like that they're pointers to functions so let's actually go ahead"
1549140,1556740," and just uh console log wasm and see what we have in that wasm module right so do does it have any uh"
1556740,1562180," right module okay so there's tables right so this is exactly what i'm talking about right so tables"
1562180,1570500," but i suppose we are interested in exports in here so there is a memory game over okay not that important i suppose"
1570500,1579540," table table table table zero and okay in one of the tables with index one you have a function"
1579540,1589540," which has a value and we can try to go into the wasm module somewhere there and it is entry"
1589540,1596180," it is the entry function that we just implemented which calls to print message"
1598340,1607220," so i suppose the point to the function in web assembly is an index in the table of functions"
1607220,1618100," and again i never use tables in web assembly so this everything i say right now is um hypothesis on how"
1618100,1623700," exactly it works but i have no idea how to access the tables right so this is instance and what is this"
1623700,1635700," like how do i access those things so uh right uh web assembly um instance get uh tables"
1635700,1644900," uh a symbol maybe i a symbol i don't know whatever uh how can i create okay so web assembly table"
1644900,1652180," web assembly table is an object in javascript so construction web assembly table uh all right all right so"
1652180,1666340," so yeah you can so you can do get uh instantiate streaming uh-huh so here is your web assembly instance this"
1666340,1676420," is an object and you can just literally do get zero get one get zero get one so all right after we did game"
1676420,1684420," initialization after we did game initialization uh a set entry function was called right so essentially"
1684420,1691220," what we can do set entry uh and we can do the following thing so entry uh right"
1691220,1702260," so we may uh essentially do the following thing let entry function undefined"
1703700,1712180," uh so entry function uh so entry function equal to entry and then in here we can say entry function"
1712180,1718660," was set to uh entry function right so that's essentially what we want to do"
1718660,1732020," and afterwards afterwards we are going to do uh w instance get entry function get entry function and let's"
1732020,1739140," simply print it right let's simply print what this thing is going to be right uh i just want to see"
1739140,1745780," how it's going to look like uh now let me let me see let me see so entry function was set to one"
1745780,1753620," uh get is not a function so you can't just do get you can't just do get you can't just do get table"
1756340,1761460," wait so this is obg but then tbl"
1761460,1764980," i'm confused"
1764980,1770980," so exported assembly functions um"
1770980,1779220," so i need to probably read what the this means because this is a weird code right so we get obg but"
1779220,1787300," where do we get tbl from do we get it from somewhere else or or what so we create a new as web assembly"
1787300,1797140," table initial two element function with obg is the table but i literally did that and it says that no"
1797140,1805220," i'm sorry it's it's not the case oh i see so that means it's not part of the instance okay okay javascript"
1805860,1811860," uh yeah there's another function right so it is not the case either it is not the case either so"
1811860,1818740," obg tbl no oh table is located in a separate wasm thing"
1820980,1822980," i don't understand how this works"
1822980,1829380," uh oh jesus oh my god"
1829380,1836260," and we create an import object that can't"
1836260,1841540," import object"
1841540,1848980," ah oh my god oh oh my god"
1851700,1851940," so"
1851940,1856660," i see this is kind of"
1856660,1865940," element uh any func sure that's basically what we have to do in here right so that's basically and"
1865940,1873780," it's a it's not really part of the environment right i see so there's also js"
1874900,1879620," and it's passed during the instantiation right so because you have an environment"
1879620,1888820," you have an environment and you also uh then do js uh you also do j why does it have to be so"
1888820,1894100," convoluted why is it not just instance uh instance table"
1896020,1905220," like why there's literally no reason to not do that so dumb uh right so this is a table and uh"
1909300,1917940," okay so and i suppose so i also have to specify the initial sort of capacity of the table which is"
1917940,1925380," also kind of weird like why why do i have to do that like dude you already have a table so this is so"
1925380,1931540," bizarre to me you already have a table i can inspect it in console in web dev console you already have a table"
1932100,1935300," fucking give it to me like why do i have to go through all these hoops"
1935300,1942100," it's so bizarre it's it's pro i'm probably doing it wrong right there must be an easier way to do"
1942100,1948420," that there must be because it's fucking moronic it's the most moronic thing i've ever seen it must be"
1948420,1951220," different it must be simpler it's just like what"
1951220,1963460," um okay so now uh we can just try to do table we can try to print the table right so we can try to"
1963460,1976260," print the table uh and so yeah okay table is that and table is null right so table is completely null and"
1976260,1984580," it doesn't contain anything in there so that means it didn't work so yeah i uh specified the table in"
1984580,1992100," here i put some stuff in there and doing it like that didn't work or did it um"
1992100,2002820," you know what i want to make a small break i want to make a cup of tea because it's"
2002820,2008900," this is bizarre this is bizarre okay let's make a small break and i'm gonna refill my tea and we're"
2008900,2015220," gonna continue working on that it's just like dude you already have a table i can see the table in dev"
2015220,2025300," tools fucking give it to me that's it the end of the story no all right so um all right so people suggested"
2025300,2032900," very interesting thing uh off screen all right so to essentially uh try to do export table right so"
2032900,2039700," maybe the linker doesn't export the table and that sounds reasonable actually that actually sounds"
2039700,2046980," reasonable um so let me go ahead and simply try to do that so we have already a lot of different linking"
2046980,2055220," flags and uh i wonder if this one is going to work uh right so i'm going to make and come on it's up"
2055220,2060980," it's not up to date please rebuild it thank you very much and it didn't come play so the linker actually"
2060980,2068020," understood that flag which is perfect in my opinion okay so this is a table i don't care about this thing"
2068020,2074980," so let's go to raylib uh let's get rid of this entire stuff let's get rid of this entire stuff and"
2074980,2082420," let's print the uh the instance one more time so here is the module here is the instance what do we"
2082420,2090900," we have an experts and uh in depth that's exactly what i wanted that's exactly what i wanted right"
2090900,2098660," so a very simple thing right so uh indirect function call table uh and here it is it this is"
2098660,2104340," the index one and everything and i don't even need to maybe save anything additional right so create"
2104340,2109620," anything okay so that's fine so we initialize this thing and that means i can now do instance"
2110420,2121220," exports indirect uh right what was it called indirect uh function table in direct function uh table get"
2121220,2129140," entry function get entry function and uh right so this is basically entry and then i can call that"
2129140,2136900," specific function so and now if i do that uh it tried to call print message it tried to call print"
2136900,2140340," message but we don't have such thing implemented here so we can go ahead and implement it"
2140340,2146580," it so and in here obviously we're going to have a message pointer uh right and how do you get the"
2146580,2154500," pointer so there's a sister of by ptr uh sister by ptr so first you have to get the memory buffer then"
2154500,2163700," essentially get the message message ptr and then we can essentially console log this entire thing and if we"
2163700,2170660," uh record well i didn't really have to recompile but if i refresh it says hello from entry so yeah that's"
2170660,2177460," basically how you operate with function pointers in web assembly through the tables um which makes sense"
2177460,2181620," right so but you should not forget to export the table and i'm actually quite surprised that"
2182820,2190740," the table is not exported automatically because uh so funnily enough i don't have to say that the memory"
2190740,2196020," has to be exported do i right so i never said explicitly that the memory has to be exported the"
2196020,2202020," memory was just exported so though i had to say explicitly that these functions has to be exported"
2202020,2208100," um it's kind of hard to tell sometimes right so it exports some things it doesn't export other things"
2208580,2213940," um but maybe memory is something that always has to be exported or something like that so this could"
2213940,2219620," be an approach and uh is it even a useful approach for us uh i'm not quite sure right so i'm not quite"
2219620,2229940," sure okay so we set some sort of entry point uh okay so that means that doesn't really change anything"
2229940,2237940," that much honestly uh doesn't really change anything that much because um we're gonna just replace"
2237940,2244340," this loop in here right so we're gonna be just replacing this loop in here and if it's a web"
2244340,2255140," right so if it's a web we're gonna just do set entry game init well to be fair not gaming it"
2255140,2263140," but game frame um to be fair we could have just now inlined all of these things all right we can just"
2263140,2273140," we can now just inline all these things uh like so all right so this is that now um so the game over"
2273140,2280020," could be part of this thing right part of the native part and uh we can actually do it like that so"
2280020,2287780," what's funny is that in case of a web you never kind of finish you you never kind of finish so probably"
2287780,2292980," it doesn't really matter anymore so yeah you kind of get rid of all of these things and that means"
2292980,2303140," you don't have to even uh you don't have to even export any of these functions right you don't have to"
2303140,2309380," export any of these functions so we can do maybe game frame i just for some reason right now i want to"
2309380,2316420," follow the convention of ray deep right the radio uses like a camel case uh right it uses the camel case"
2316420,2327220," and in here how can we can we call it we can say ray lib js set uh frame or set entry let's call it let's"
2327220,2333860," call it set entry right so it's a special sort of thing uh right so if you are on the web uh you just"
2333860,2343860," do that uh game frame and maybe that is better maybe that is even closer to like how m scripting"
2343860,2349060," works so and essentially what you suppose what we're supposed to do in here from the point of view of"
2349060,2356740," ray lib js is to call main once which will just set up the game frame thing is that entry and that is it"
2356740,2362820," so then we can get you continue running this thing um now this looks like m scripting but without the pain"
2362820,2366900," yeah there was a little bit of a pain with tables right there was a little bit of pain in the table"
2366900,2373780," but apart from that it's actually super close uh maybe that is better maybe that is better so if not"
2373780,2384820," dev platform web uh yeah yeah probably i forgot just a second if dev platform web okay so let me try to"
2384820,2392740," maybe compile this entire stuff uh i'm going to simply compile you know game native version of"
2392740,2399700," the game so it complains about some things so it's a frame game frame and if i run this entire thing"
2399700,2406260," uh is it going to work yeah it does in fact work so that's that's pretty cool that's lovely uh so but"
2406260,2412660," we do need to import one thing in here so export i mean we'll have to export main function right so we"
2412660,2419700," export in the main but we don't care about game frame game over or anything like that um we don't care about"
2419700,2428820," any of those things so now i'm going to try to compile the wasm version of this thing so it's"
2428820,2435860," going to be wasm and wasm boom and i didn't want to run it i just wanted to compile it and it seems to"
2435860,2442100," be compiling okay let's go back to here uh game init is not a function right as you can see because we don't"
2442100,2451220," export it anymore that makes a lot of sense so now instead of doing that we have to do main only once"
2451220,2458180," and the function that is going to be called it's going to be array leap js set entry and here is the"
2458180,2467220," entry uh and we have entry function and we have this thing and um basically instead of calling game frame we can"
2467220,2476340," call this entry thingy uh and that should be actually yeah that's it so that was it that was easier than"
2476340,2488660," i thought okay so yeah now it is very close to the m scripted version which is kind of cool right"
2488660,2495140," all right all right all right so we probably don't need the print message uh we'll need to have some sort"
2495140,2503220," of a login functions exported uh i don't really want to use extensions gcc extensions and stuff like that"
2503220,2511780," okay so let me see what's going to be the next thing what's going to be the next thing so we have core"
2511780,2522260," basic window um and in here right and in here we just need to factor out the uh the thing so let's do"
2522260,2538580," game frame uh game game game frame void and move all of this stuff to the game frame game frame"
2538580,2550260," let's remove four in here so i'm trying to not modify the code too much uh if defined uh platform web"
2551380,2561540," array lib js set entry game frame otherwise do this thing otherwise do this thing yeah this is actually"
2561540,2567940," minimal modifications to the original so yeah that's actually really cool just to move the the frame"
2567940,2577780," into a separate function and it's going to be like as usual um essentially essentially uh now i can try to do"
2578420,2586180," wasm core basic let's try to recompile this entire thing ray deep is unknown um so game c one of the"
2586180,2594260," things we have to do we have to bring that stuff in there um okay so let's put it maybe somewhere here"
2594260,2608180," all right so that seems to be compelling uh ray deep j s uh so game wasn't core basic wasn't so let's see"
2608180,2614660," how we can do this thing uh main is not a function right because i forgot to export this thing um"
2614660,2620340," so how would we do that so we are exporting everything except the main uh right we're"
2620340,2625140," exporting everything except the main so this is main and this is game init"
2625140,2632420," all right and let's see let's see let's see let's see let's see there we go"
2633300,2639460," so undefined properties and we don't export the table all right so now i know"
2639460,2647300," what we have to do in here what we have to do in here"
2647300,2654340," okay look at that uh so how can i stop it by the way"
2656500,2663460," all right so it rendered the thing correctly right it rendered the thing correctly um it would be kind"
2663460,2670660," of cool to maybe stop the execution if any of the error has happened in here uh right but if error is"
2670660,2676100," happening for instance when you're trying to access something that doesn't really have a thing instead"
2676100,2684020," of doing the error uh like console error we could have done maybe something like new error uh and just"
2684020,2689380," throw this thing is that a good idea right i kind of like the fact that it would show everything that we"
2689380,2697140," don't have uh right so yeah maybe we could have like some sort of a boolean that that sounds good"
2697140,2705540," um but maybe the exception is going to like stop the execution let's give it a try um so i'm gonna go to"
2705540,2714260," here uh i pressed dev tools it's taking so much time to open up i don't know what the fuck all of"
2714260,2722260," that run ads all right okay so that seems to be that that's that's a good idea right so not implemented"
2722260,2728100," draw text and uh we can even go here uh in a place where that happens that's way better just throw an"
2728100,2736100," exception that's definitely the js way i mean it's not about like philosophy or approach right i liked"
2736100,2740740," the fact that i could see the the entire list of all the functions that i need to implement"
2740740,2748180," here i see one function at a time so yeah so it's just like about like actual practical benefits"
2750580,2758180," to draw text um let's go ahead and implement them though also um the text that doesn't contain"
2758180,2764340," enough useful information i wonder if i can do something like this all right so this is going to be"
2764340,2773540," a prop uh right prop and then uh take a look at the args i just want to see the args all right because"
2773540,2779220," this is yeah this is very useful so these are these are the arguments and i don't remember what they are"
2779220,2793700," honestly so raylib um include raylib dot h draw text so where is the function draw text aha so here it is"
2793700,2800660," might as well by the way copy paste this thing in the draw text so we didn't implement it yet"
2801380,2803620," uh let's go ahead and implement it draw text"
2803620,2814020," so in here we're going to have a text which is a pointer position x position y font size and color"
2814020,2819300," and by the way uh do we have a function that extracts the color by the pointer"
2819300,2824980," uh i think we should have it all right because that happens several times uh already specifically in clear"
2824980,2832660," color um so it would be nice to just factor out this entire stuff to a separate function"
2832660,2847780," get color from memory get color for memory and in here so we're going to have a buffer the memory buffer"
2848980,2853220," and so we just just return that"
2853220,2863540," now if i try to do that um"
2863540,2869540," get color from memory"
2871220,2880020," and just pass the uh point uh right so we also have ptr so color ptr"
2880020,2890580," and on top of that we can just put it in here and that's that all right"
2898260,2904660," all right all right and uh so the the color the background color was set up correctly and draw text"
2904660,2910340," doesn't really complain uh and the you know the the loop continues actually right since it doesn't"
2910340,2918580," complain the loops like continues doing things so we have to draw the text with the ray lip um really"
2918580,2924980," font but we don't have a really font yet but we want to draw some sort of a text already so let's go ahead"
2924980,2932580," and just draw whatever text with whatever font uh right so canvas html5 uh draw text so let's take a"
2932580,2934020," look at how you draw the text"
2934020,2945060," uh so drawing text web api all right uh so field text that's definitely something that we'll have to do so"
2945540,2955700," oh yeah boy boy okay so maybe we're gonna just use the default one uh and so what are the parameters"
2955700,2965860," x and y and then we like max width and everything all right so this is a text pointer and uh sister from"
2965860,2972260," pointer this is something that we have to do uh so the buffer is wasm instance"
2972900,2981060," experts memory right so we get the actual text that we want to render so this is the actual text"
2981060,2992580," then we take the context fill text add text and position x position y right so we don't really set"
2992580,2999380," the font yet uh but we will in the future uh so let's go ahead and see how it's gonna work"
3000340,3011220," so we cannot read property undefined of experts um instances instance uh okay title ptr is not defined"
3011220,3019140," text ptr by the way is there some sort of like convenient linter for javascript right i don't feel like"
3019140,3028980," using typescript in here i would like to have like a very simple linter wait isn't strager working on some"
3028980,3034020," some sort of a javascript linter in c plus plus wait how is it called does anybody know do we have any"
3034020,3039540," strager reviews in here what what what's the aim of the of the thing he's developing maybe we should try"
3039540,3048260," it it is yes lint uh quick lint js let's actually take a look at this quick uh is it checking types or"
3048260,3054740," like something quickly because i saw that it's like super fast because it's implemented in native language"
3055540,3060420," uh right quickly in gs find javascript bugs i mean that's probably what we want"
3060420,3068740," uh so no types but syntax error oh it's only syntax errors right but i don't know what's what's the"
3068740,3075860," scope of this project uh is an instant feedback as you could find bugs in your i don't really like the"
3075860,3081860," instance feedback as you could as i could i suppose i'm very old-fashioned by the way i feel like i'm very"
3081860,3091300," old-fashioned um so i like to just code for some time uh like introducing errors and stuff like that"
3091300,3098580," and not being at all that i have an error and then once i'm done putting out my my thoughts i compile"
3098580,3103620," everything or link everything and then i go through the errors like in a you know to-do list and fix them"
3103620,3111540," up right i don't like to uh be reminded that i have errors while in i'm in this state of flow so and"
3111540,3117780," that's why i don't use these like lsps and stuff like that that constantly tell me that uh you know"
3117780,3122340," there are some errors because i don't want my like trail of thoughts to be interrupted so but i suppose"
3122340,3131220," this uh thing it has like um uh it's just a command line tool i can just run it separately so install cli"
3131220,3141380," i install vim plugin yeah install cli so linux debian manual all right static links"
3141380,3145460," all right"
3145460,3153940," okay all the strokes for all the folks i like that okay"
3154500,3166900," um so and if i take a look at that all right so this is the project and let's just unpack this"
3166900,3167460," and i think"
3167460,3178900," quick lint js so there's a lot of docs and stuff like that that's cool that's cool uh and bin and this is"
3178900,3185860," executable if you take a look at the file all right so it is uh dynamically linked but uh does it depend on"
3185860,3187780," anything uh okay"
3187780,3190740," all right"
3190740,3198420," i already respect the unboxing experience right so he spent all the time to provide like a lot of"
3198420,3203940," different ways for people to install right so package managers and pm if you are into this kind of stuff"
3204580,3210340," uh right and for people like me he provided just like a download of the thing so i respect that that's"
3210340,3216180," actually very cool so let's actually try to run this thing and see what it does a quick lint and"
3216180,3226500," been uh click in js so expected file name okay very simple step forward ready js no errors yay"
3229380,3235460," so i wonder if we can introduce some errors uh what if i bring the title back would it caught that"
3235460,3238020," it got that"
3238020,3246100," is it on github"
3255300,3262900," nothing much to say it even caught an error that i had so yeah i suppose i can recommend that"
3262900,3265380," all right"
3265380,3272660," so where's the description"
3272660,3283780," so uh let's continue let's continue so we draw the text but there is something weird going on so with the"
3283780,3290020," fill text it doesn't really feel the text right uh i don't see so i suppose one of the things we have"
3290020,3296820," to do after we fill the text we have to say fill don't we or maybe we have to set up the font right"
3296820,3305140," maybe we have to set up the font uh and uh yeah so do you have to set the color as well uh maybe maybe"
3305140,3316020," maybe that's what i have to do uh right nope so let's try to maybe put zero in here um"
3316020,3323780," no okay so you all you know what i'm going to try to do i'm going to do console lock and i'm going to"
3323780,3333380," just try to take a look at the text all right so this is going to be the text uh text and uh so throw an error new error"
3333380,3341220," uh stop so it's not gonna go and continue doing things so you created your first window yeah that"
3341220,3348340," makes sense okay so congrats you created your new new window um but i don't really understand"
3348340,3355540," maybe it's the same color as the background yeah so i suppose what i have to do i have to do uh fill style"
3356260,3363780," uh and just set that to let's put let's put black in here all right so let's put black in here so and"
3363780,3368980," i'm just check that everything's fine uh yeah okay so i can see that all right so that's cool"
3368980,3378100," so let's quickly get rid of the uh console all right let's get rid of the console and uh now"
3378980,3385780," yeah let's actually extract the color uh color from get color from memory i have an inconsistent style"
3385780,3388740," of of naming right so that probably pisses off a lot of people"
3391220,3395060," but i'm gonna fix it up later okay i i promise i'm gonna fix it up later"
3395060,3406900," uh it's just like whatever color get color from memory buffer and we have a color point"
3406900,3414900," right so this is a color ptr color ptr and that's basically it so that's the color we might as well"
3414900,3424020," actually directly and that's fine it's fine fine uh and now if i refresh this entire thing uh that seems"
3424020,3430340," to be working and but we also need to set the position x and position y right so and there we go"
3430340,3439940," congrats you created your first not even first but first first whatever that means you created your first"
3444900,3459460," okay okay so that's pretty cool uh no no no no no so we need to somehow set up the font for raylib"
3459460,3467220," right what kind of font does it use does it use like a ttf font or is that like a bitmap font"
3467220,3473540," that's a very interesting question so let's we have to read the raylib source code uh raylib"
3474900,3480820," i think i'm gonna go into the mutualizer i'm gonna go into the mutualizer uh and i'm gonna find"
3480820,3492660," raylib so let's find the implementation uh for draw text uh that that was too much i think that was too"
3492660,3500180," much uh maybe i have to do something like this draw text but maybe let's include the open parent uh so"
3500180,3506580," we have a text what's funny is that the implementation is inside of our text so it's not even our core"
3506580,3514100," but the example claiming to be the example of core but they use the stuff from the module our text"
3514100,3520020," okay"
3522500,3530820," uh get default font all right so uh they get the default font uh and i wonder like what is the default"
3530820,3540580," font so if it's just a single ttf right if it's just a single ttf maybe maybe i can basically get it uh"
3540580,3550820," right so default font so and what is the default font so it just returns this thing is that a global variable it"
3550820,3558660," looks like a global variable honestly um is it loaded somehow load default font okay so that makes sense"
3558660,3575700," and what do we have in here oh this one is interesting support default font"
3578820,3594500," the other thing is okay so it unloads the image it unloads the image we can try to compile that to"
3594500,3599860," web assembly actually so it does the allocations and shit okay"
3599860,3608100," uh it does this is basically the font by the way this is basically the font and this is sort of like the"
3608100,3614580," atlas i suppose is directly defined here data generated from a sprite font image this way we"
3614580,3620180," reconstruct font without creating large global variables this data is automatically located"
3620180,3627700," to stack and automatically de-allocated at the end of this function okay so it does in fact fit into the"
3627700,3638020," stack so it's 512 uh four bytes integers so we allocated for 112 uh so two kilobytes on the stack"
3638100,3646180," here uh so we can we use the image from somewhere we can try to save this image to um to png"
3646180,3653620," actually but i don't know the uh size width and height what's the width and height of this image"
3655220,3671700," um so 128 by 128 okay so let me let me see um so generate uh what's called font.c right so let's put it in here"
3671700,3682260," let's put it in here let's put it in here and so that's a lot that's a lot man that's a lot uh right"
3682260,3687380," so i'm gonna just put it in here so it wants to do something like this"
3692980,3700820," and we can probably take the stb stb image um do i have stb image somewhere i'm pretty sure i can just"
3700820,3711780," go to visualize already uh src external stb image stb image right specifically all right and i can just"
3711780,3717140," put that stuff in here to be fair i would like to uh maybe create a separate folder for font because it's"
3717140,3723060," it's a little bit messy it starts to become a little bit messy so i think i want to move with"
3723060,3734260," there uh right so we're going to have that and we can include uh stb image right page and then define"
3734260,3742420," stb image right implementation right so stb image right implementation and essentially we can just say"
3742420,3752180," that stb image right so i think it's stbi write png right so we can do something like that we can just"
3752180,3765140," do something like that file is going to be font png and png 128 by 128 for the data is pixels um so this is"
3765140,3774100," in pixels i suppose and stride in bytes is going to be 128 multiplied by four all right so and we just do"
3774100,3782100," that and we can try to compile this entire thing font font dot c there we go so that what does it say"
3782100,3792900," pixels it's not really pixels it's default font data default font data uh yeah okay"
3795140,3812660," and that's what um that is unexpected so if you do yeah that's that's bizarre isn't it so that is not"
3812660,3820100," correct that is definitely not correct so something something sus is going on um what was the function"
3820100,3827300," where we had our text right so this this was our text so maybe this is not pixels right so this is"
3827300,3829780," not what i thought two bytes per p okay"
3829780,3834820," two bytes per pixel um"
3840500,3851940," ah so it's not just a raw data i see it's not just a raw data uh so you then reconstruct an image"
3851940,3858180," all right you reconstruct an image and then you load the texture out of that image"
3858180,3863380," all right then you generate the glyphs and stuff like that so blah blah blah the usual thing"
3864580,3869220," well why the usual thing it would be kind of cool to maybe compile this entire stuff to"
3869220,3875700," web assembly and just run it from web assembly because this doesn't really depend on like much on"
3875700,3885460," the standard library right except for the um you know for the alloc right so there's an alloc so this is a"
3885460,3896980," calloc and then it calls low texture from image but this thing um essentially just uh does the opengl thing"
3896980,3899460," right does the open gl thing again"
3899460,3908420," uh and uh then so another malloc but i mean we can just like implement a bump allocator in"
3909540,3913540," in web assembly and use that right so just implement the bump allocator"
3913540,3921380," and unloading the image right so and unloading is just freeing it doesn't really matter that much"
3921380,3938100," um so yeah to be fair it would be way cooler if ray leap was on top of some sort of like an"
3938100,3946500," abstraction layer that i could just implement in javascript i think it technically is i think it"
3946500,3953460," technically is because raylib recently introduced a thing called platform right so raylib architecture"
3953460,3960260," i remember rayson actually posted like architecture uh think um but i'm not sure if i can find that"
3960260,3967860," so the architecture of the raylib um does anybody remember the architecture here is the architecture yes"
3967860,3976820," that's what i'm talking about so here's the game uh so at the very bottom you have opengl and stuff like"
3976820,3984660," that but then the platform libraries then you have this is outdated by the way this is outdated so you"
3984660,3994260," have our core yeah so there is no our platform anymore if i'm not mistaken now you have our platform in"
3994260,4002100," here right here right here it is so our core platform uh our core platform you have a gl w sdl"
4002100,4008340," web drm so they already kind of have like a web but i mean so what do they do for the web what do they"
4008340,4017140," do for the web what do they do for the web what do they do for the web so platforms so this is the web how do they implement that"
4017220,4030580," um um so initialize platform so they still use gl of w right and gl of w is just like a compiled"
4030580,4035060," with them scripting thing it's just simply compiled within scripting thing"
4035060,4041060," so they're just using scripting so which is actually against the point that i'm trying to make in here"
4043060,4051460," uh um so there is even our core template i think i even saw that i think i even saw that so basically"
4051460,4058020," you just create that you just fill it in and it's going to work but it's not going to work for ours"
4058020,4065860," right because our core for instance is on top of our platform right uh our core is on top of our platform"
4065860,4071300," and this thing already depends on the standard library it's like our platform is not the only thing"
4071300,4078580," uh that it depends on so our platform is not abstract enough for what i'm trying to do right"
4078580,4087060," um it will be kind of interesting like if it was fully yeah even our core is not fully on top of rlgl"
4087060,4093220," so that's what's interesting uh even our core is not fully on rlgl"
4093940,4102420," so we could implement rlgl on webgl and that probably automatically means that we like all of"
4102420,4109060," these things will work that's actually rather interesting uh our textures also depend on stb"
4109060,4114900," image but stb image uh could be you know compiled for web assembly as well right it could be compliant"
4114900,4121860," for web assembly as well all right so uh what's going to be the plan so what kind of plan do do we need"
4122420,4130660," um so i suppose for now we need to make the example work right so that's the goal um we just need to"
4130660,4139540," get the sprite sheet of the um of the font right the sprite sheet of the font and um just use it to"
4139540,4148260," to render the text just use it to render the text so it's it's basically um um it's basically a bitmap"
4148260,4153060," font and i wonder if the browsers just support the bitmap fonts or do we have to like query things"
4153060,4160100," ourselves uh that's an interesting question but uh anyway i would like to make a small break i would"
4160100,4165380," like to make a small break uh so and think about it a little bit and after the small break we're gonna"
4165380,4171700," tackle this specific problem all right so on the break we discussed a little bit about the fonts and"
4171700,4180180," share and apparently uh you can get the font really font as ttf or waaf or something like that the font"
4180180,4188820," itself called grixel and we can actually just get that so we already lost that information yeah so we"
4188820,4196020," already kind of lost it uh so i would like to but maybe we can just do use the css that somebody posted"
4196020,4201620," uh i don't know this is kind of sus right this is kind of sus i don't want to use that i want to just"
4201620,4206820," like use that directly so uh yeah thank you so much ttf thank you thank you thank you thank you"
4206820,4214260," who needs chat gpt when you have chat am i right who needs chat gpt so already uh so we don't need this"
4214260,4218900," font i'm going to remove it but i'm going to create it again that's how i empty folders i just"
4218900,4225220," remove it and create again and i'm going to just download this entire thing w get and we get the"
4225220,4238340," font we've got the font next question is uh how do we add it to css uh css so let me let me see so"
4238340,4244020," as you can see we were trying to hack a ray leap website and we tried to extract the font right"
4245620,4249380," so ray san we hacked your website we stole your font depth"
4249380,4256980," anyway so css uh"
4256980,4269140," hacked stole the font stole the font borrowed it borrowed the phone uh yep so maybe i should have"
4269140,4274820," said custom font that's probably what i should have said custom fonts i'm not a web developer okay i don't"
4274820,4281860," remember this kind of shot off the top of my head right i need to go to w3s w3 schools right so that's"
4281860,4289300," what i need um right font face that sounds like an insult it's such a font face"
4289300,4296420," so let's actually grab that"
4300100,4303380," i think i think i make that joke every time i do fonts with css"
4303380,4312420," so and this is like a font and another thing i remember another thing i remember is that"
4312420,4318500," this never works for me first try that's what i remember right so we're going to spend some time"
4318500,4324500," trying to figure out what the is going on uh all right but i'm already kind of prepared for that i'm"
4324500,4332900," already kind of prepared for that so i can actually rename it to fonts and this one is not sans blah blah blah"
4332900,4334500," blah blah this one is acme"
4334500,4344900," did somebody just troll me this is not grixel or is it well i mean it's a grixel acme something something"
4344900,4357140," i'm gonna just remember the person who's send this thing so it was no dear rep okay it was not direct all"
4357140,4367860," right noted um yeah no no no no so if it doesn't work we know who to ban we know who to ban uh right so i'm going to copy paste this thing um"
4367860,4375220," so grixel"
4375220,4388500," and when we are doing raylib.js raylib.js i'm going to just do grixel but i'm going to set not going to send"
4388500,4393620," font size and i suppose what we'll have to do we'll have to sort of put font size in here"
4397860,4410100," uh anyway so uh let's continue so trolling zozin must be expensive you should pay the price"
4410100,4413940," for trolling da zozin uh so let's take a look at the network"
4413940,4427540," so boom okay so it worked kind of kind of it kind of worked yeah it doesn't feel literally the same"
4427860,4434820," all right i do agree with that uh we can try to just compare that to core uh basic thinking"
4434820,4440340," it's not really the same that's bizarre why is different"
4440340,4450340," huh this is because this was probably the original y and then ray sun has changed it"
4451140,4453700," so that's probably the situation in here"
4453700,4462740," that's probably the situation in here okay so now let's go and take a look at the console log"
4462740,4467700," right so this is going to be font size right so might as well actually do a pretty interesting thing"
4467700,4477060," new error error font size is this thing so this is the font size and then we're going to just throw"
4477060,4482820," that so we want to throw an exception so it stops the execution of the loop uh right so we can see"
4482820,4489780," in this mist uh so font size is 20 okay so that means we can just go ahead and suppose it is in pixels"
4489780,4499700," it is in pixels um all right why did they do that that's so dumb uh all right all right all right all right"
4499700,4512020," that didn't work uh that's bizarre my new friend what if i oh yeah i know why because i supposed to put"
4512020,4522420," backticks backticks uh the font yeah so the size is slightly different right so the actual size here is"
4522420,4528100," slightly different so what if i directly put 20 in here is it going to change that much"
4529300,4542260," um oh my god i okay open already thank you so much yeah so what about 15 yeah what about 10"
4542260,4552740," yeah we're very close uh maybe we should try to use that wolf wolf uh font maybe it's a little bit"
4552740,4558340," better so it feels like the ttf is outdated one and maybe that's the reason why it's not used"
4558900,4564500," on the original website so what was the wolf one uh and by the way so we should ban null direct i'm"
4564500,4571620," joking by the way we should not i'm joking i'm joking i'm not banning anyone today uh right i'm actually"
4571620,4578260," trying not to ban people it's difficult sometimes because you mother flippers deserve it but"
4578260,4582900," i'm trying to be a good person okay i'm trying to be a good person"
4586100,4592340," even though you all deserve to be banned and i'm telling you and so here's the wolf"
4592340,4599940," uh so i remember it was why are they called acme something something because maybe they are maybe"
4599940,4605460," they they are it's just like grixel it is called grixel in css right it is called grixel in css"
4605460,4611540," you know what i don't trust the chat okay i i won't look into that myself i want to look into that myself"
4613620,4618580," so i'm gonna do that yet again i'm gonna try to hack the website one more time"
4618580,4631780," okay so then we look into the font and the font is grixel acme 7 we can try to copy the value and then"
4631780,4639060," go into the source and find i mean yeah probably we didn't even have to so here's the font yeah it's"
4639060,4644260," actually it's actually it's actually like that right so it's called it's called grixel in the in the css"
4644260,4649860," all right now i'm more or less confident in all of this i'm more or less confident"
4649860,4660740," uh so ttf uh wolf right i have a feeling that so do they have y yeah they seem to have a y"
4663060,4669460," is there a y anywhere in here we can try to uh to change that"
4669460,4671460," your mom"
4671460,4680820," okay so why seems to be correct this is the fresh new wine so that means the ttf font is outdated"
4681460,4695620," um did you see shise no it's an old one it's still an old one and this is where"
4695620,4700900," the trouble comes in right even though we have waffen here right"
4702900,4712740," and i keep refreshing though oh this this is interesting so we have to take the capital one"
4712740,4718980," so what if yeah okay i see i see what's going on"
4718980,4724580," it's still doing that so there is a huge discrepancy between like a"
4724580,4729060," font that is used on website and the the font that is used in there so"
4731460,4738020," we'll have to do something about that i will have to do something about that um"
4738020,4742820," for now for now what we can do"
4742820,4752340," is uh maybe have some sort of a factor that adjusts all of that right so we may try to have"
4752340,4760980," some sort of a factor so if i just set uh if i just set font size if i just set the font size"
4762020,4768580," it's obviously going to change but we can multiply it to sort of like account for"
4768580,4779220," uh for all of these things right so maybe 75 uh or something so if we take a look at the core basic"
4779220,4790980," window all right so it's kind of centered it's kind of centered but it's way smaller it's way"
4790980,4798740," smaller than whatever we had in there so maybe we can basically eyeball it right what about six"
4798740,4802020," something like that"
4802020,4809460," 0.6 looks good yeah congrats you created your first window"
4810900,4818580," so it's it's a hack it's a hack for sure uh but we ported one example in here we kind of ported one"
4818580,4826340," example in here and because this factor is baked right it's sort of kind of baked in there um so the"
4826340,4833220," other examples that use the same function may work more or less correctly uh they may work more or less"
4833220,4840500," correct one so let's me see let me see so maybe um"
4840500,4852020," let's factor it out font size factor all right font size factor"
4855460,4868180," so note we are not using the same um font as in the ray leap"
4868180,4876580," itself we stole we stole we stole um we stole it from the website"
4878740,4889220," top from the website um and it's slightly different uh we stole let's put it this way we stole"
4889220,4903940," the font from the website https raylib.com and it's slightly different than the one baked into raylib library itself"
4907140,4912020," so to account for the differences"
4912020,4922980," differences we scale this size with a magical factor"
4922980,4931220," we stole the font from the website and it's slightly different than the one"
4932820,4939060," that is baked into raylib library itself to account for the differences so we scale the size with"
4939060,4945380," with a magical uh factor so maybe it would be better"
4945380,4950660," it would be better to"
4950660,4957700," it would be nice to have a better approach"
4958900,4964980," but i don't know which one so as of right now as of right now i don't know which approach would be better"
4964980,4969540," so i'm gonna leave it as it is right now"
4969540,4979140," so now we can try to take a look at some other examples um that use these functions like draw text and"
4979140,4986020," everything so i think there was another example like um you know core controls that test controls and stuff like"
4986020,4992180," that and they do use the same like a draw text function i want to see how that example will work"
4992180,4998820," with this function right and whether the the factor is good enough right so maybe more examples will help"
4998820,5004580," us to adjust these things a little bit better that specific factor right and of course i don't consider"
5004580,5009780," that to be a final solution right so it's just like it's a stopgap right so what we need to do we need to keep"
5009780,5015700," moving we need to keep implementing functions right and the more functions we implement the more we"
5015700,5022020," explore the internals of ray deep and stuff like that the more information we gather which potentially"
5022020,5028820," may help us to make better decisions and stuff like that so we're doing recreational programming in here"
5028820,5035380," we're not rushing a product to a market we can just afford to do that we can just afford to explore"
5035940,5042660," uh and stuff like that and that's basically the gist of my channel by the way it's basically the gist of"
5042660,5052740," my channel um just a pile more data to approach the correct layer exactly we're literally training"
5052740,5058900," this model this is one of the parameter of this model right so this is like a manual learning instead of"
5058900,5068260," machine one um so it's funny that some systems before the ai boom and stuff like that some search"
5068260,5075140," i think some search engines they quite often had like a ton of different rejects to account for some"
5075140,5081380," special cases and stuff like that and the um they may have like a separate module specifically dedicated to"
5081380,5088580," regexes and those rejects were modified manually and stuff like that you can view like this spaghetti of"
5088580,5095300," different regexes as just a language model that you adjust manually right it's not that different"
5095300,5101540," from automatic adjustments just like you do that manually it's kind of fascinating isn't it right so"
5101540,5110500," it only recently occurred to me that you can view your code your source code as a model that you train"
5110500,5116340," manually that should tweak parameters of which manually that's a very interesting view on the on the code"
5118340,5125220," and then i think it's it's like actually close to truth right so we're basically meta optimizers of"
5125220,5134420," this model um um can chat gpt write valid regex i don't know can it i don't use chat gpt daily"
5134420,5141060," uh so we'll get some subs uh thank you so much grappas uh for tier one substitution thank you thank you"
5141060,5152500," thank you so i could use chat gpt uh but um so i had to create like a foreign sim card right so then i"
5152500,5160020," have to have vpn and to be fair chat gpt doesn't give me that much of a value to justify the hassle of"
5160020,5167540," setting it up for me right i use the chat gpt like a little bit through different proxies and stuff like"
5167540,5174580," that i kind of get what the idea of what it can uh right it's i can see the value for some people in"
5174580,5180660," there but for me personally i just like i can't see the value of that thing for me personally it's just like"
5181220,5187780," it doesn't help me what with what i do usually it doesn't really help me with what i do usually"
5187780,5194180," well it helps a little but it helps a little bit but not significantly so i can't see how we can"
5194180,5197460," incorporate that into my to my workflow so that's why it's just like i don't use"
5199780,5205380," all right so let's go ahead and port in that example so i think i'm gonna just go ahead and"
5205380,5212820," literally uh commit whatever we already have because i think it's uh it's cool and all is there any"
5212820,5222420," uh license for the fonts or we don't really need to have license uh to do add the grixel"
5224100,5229780," font the i don't know if it's called actually grixel right so it's called grixel in css but it's"
5229780,5238500," not calling that in in the font file so i don't know add the license of the official"
5238500,5247460," ray lib font here all right so this is going to be the to-do um so so these are the examples"
5249380,5255780," let me see so i have a lot of garbage in here honestly uh can i do git ignore"
5255780,5266420," so maybe we could maybe build everything into a separate folder so to speak uh could we build"
5266420,5272900," everything into a separate folder that would be actually kind of cool um so here are the examples"
5277940,5285380," you know what maybe i should create a shell script build sh right let's create a shell script uh and"
5285380,5293780," in here right in here we're going to be doing uh something like this so this is that but first of"
5293780,5304100," all we're going to create the build um the build uh and we have includes in here and we're going to put"
5304100,5310500," that into the build right so this is the first thing and then we're going to have the game itself but the"
5310500,5316260," game.c is located not in here i want to put it into the examples folder because i want to reserve examples"
5316260,5322580," for the folders specifically for the uh raylib examples right so this one is not really a raylib example it's"
5322580,5333700," my personal one so yeah so yes so yes so yeah uh where is my another make file and in here we just build"
5333700,5347380," this thing so these are the other things right these are the wasm and maybe we can factor out this stuff to"
5348100,5358340," um to a separate function so to speak so we can call it um for a list of the for the list of the files"
5358340,5366660," right so then i'm gonna make it executable and i'm gonna just rebuild this and type and see"
5367460,5373460," so game frame i forgot to do that uh yep that seems to be working"
5373460,5382660," and one of the things i like to do by the way is also enable tracing so i can see what commands are"
5382660,5387380," executed in here so as you can see yeah uh we can clearly see what is executed and it's just like"
5388180,5398740," pretty cool pretty cool pretty cool so let's remove make file let's remove make file and in the readme"
5398740,5406020," i'm going to replace this thing to build sh so that's going to be the thing"
5406020,5414260," so the reason why i was making the build thing the reason why i was making the build thing is that now"
5414260,5422260," it is super easy to git ignore the build completely right so uh it didn't really do that right because"
5422260,5429780," it's supposed to put this thing right so we git ignore that uh we don't need that so examples they"
5429780,5438100," only contain that uh the fonts contain that right so that's fine so for the raylib um maybe i should"
5438100,5443700," actually create something like liban here and put raylib in here right so i think i want to commit"
5443700,5449300," it into the repo so people can just sort of test it or something i think that would be a good idea so"
5449300,5456100," it's basically breaks the build script but we can go ahead and quickly fix that right so now minus l has"
5456100,5464100," to be lib and here it also has to be do so i think it's kind of important to just be able to build the same"
5464100,5470820," c file into both web assembly and the binary thing to sort of prove that it's portable right so you can"
5470820,5477140," actually report that so because of that we need to have a copy of raylib in here uh so let's go ahead"
5477140,5485140," and do that and okay so that seems to be working um so we deleted that so we modified this one we edit that"
5485140,5493700," one we modified this thing uh we edit face we did that and i also commit wasm because i'm also deploying"
5493700,5499780," uh this entire thing to uh github pages uh we also deploy that to github pages by the way speaking of"
5499780,5507780," github pages uh i think they are broken now uh if i go to uh why is it so slow uh"
5507780,5518500," so in github dot io raylib js yeah they are broken now they are in fact broken now and because it cannot"
5518500,5529780," load yeah so that's that's bizarre so it's trying to load raylib dot js which is the name of the project"
5529780,5538900," right and if we take a look at this entire thing so we're loading slash raylib dot js so and i didn't"
5538900,5547060," write that code so the first pull request broke prod server literally broke prod server"
5549780,5556500," uh right so classic classic classic classic i wonder if that will fix it i think that will fix"
5556500,5564020," it right uh that should be everything essentially so we want to also clone that we not clone that but"
5564020,5570500," commit that and that that's basically everything uh right so maybe eventually i will move game.c"
5570500,5576180," like to somewhere else right so uh as soon as we have more examples as soon as we have more examples"
5576180,5579700," game.c is not going to be needed right so the examples are going to be like the demonstration"
5579700,5590180," of this and that i think um right so just let's go ahead and say port core basic window to uh array"
5590180,5596500," js right so let's push that uh right into the repo and see how it goes"
5596500,5604100," and see how it goes uh so where is raylib.js"
5608900,5614500," so does it look good does it look gucci tamaguchi so includes contain the headers for raylib fonts"
5614500,5622340," examples sleep and stuff like that so that's pretty cool okay so let's go ahead and uh port another"
5622340,5626900," example right something more substantial because this is basically hello world there is nothing"
5626900,5636420," particularly interesting in here uh so let's go to mutualize array deep as array deep src and so we"
5636420,5642660," don't have examples here okay so i was downloading the examples from a different place okay custom frame"
5642660,5645540," control custom frame control"
5645540,5649060," basic window"
5649060,5654260," custom logging drop files"
5654260,5660100," basic screen manager uh is it interesting example"
5660900,5666980," so how do you press enter or tap jump to play to gameplay screen huh is that"
5666980,5675940," screen manager so how many things does it have in here does it have shaders and i hope it doesn't"
5675940,5682980," have shaders i hope it's super simple uh keep press enter draw text draw rectangle this is ideal"
5683860,5689220," all right so we have draw text draw rectangle we already have these two things implemented no we"
5689220,5692740," don't we don't have draw rectangle this is something that we'll have to implement"
5692740,5699460," um so yeah that's pretty cool so let's go ahead and take that so we're going to try to port these things"
5699460,5711540," uh so let's just put it in here basic screen manager"
5711540,5723940," uh to do to do so query replace uh core basic window and basic screen manager so there's two things"
5724420,5729300," and i'm going to compile on the native one right so we're compiling on the native one because i want"
5729300,5737860," to see what this is going to do uh right so i'm going to do core basic screen manager all right wait"
5738980,5751540," uh press enter uh oh it's just okay press enter or tap or jump to ending string so it basically goes"
5751540,5757140," through different screens okay that's that's cool so that's actually a substantial example"
5757140,5766260," that's actually a substantial example i think that's pretty cool um right so now uh let's basically"
5766260,5771060," copy paste this entire thing and i'm going to quickly replace this one one more time and we're"
5771060,5777140," going to rebuild that for web as well so we're building that for web okay that's cool and let's go"
5777140,5787700," to raylib.js uh specifically the file and let's replace this stuff basic uh was that screen manager"
5787700,5792980," okay so it's actually pretty straightforward to add a new example right so we just copy paste a bunch of"
5792980,5797380," things but i mean if you know how to do that right so for new people it's probably not particularly"
5797380,5802900," obvious but uh yeah let's go ahead and just refresh and see how it is going to go and what kind of"
5802900,5808900," functions does it need right so it will tell us what it wants uh windows should close well we have to"
5808900,5815780," first yeah i completely forgot we have to modify the entry points right uh we need to modify the entry point"
5816900,5826740," so example uh basic screen manager uh and essentially yeah we need to move this entire thing into the game"
5826740,5833460," frame uh right so let's go ahead and do that that should be praised for the game frame void uh-huh"
5834580,5840340," so and i'm taking taking the entirety of this thing and replacing it with game frame"
5840340,5847380," that's the game frame that's the game frame"
5847380,5856180," and now if defined platform platform web"
5857540,5870980," we set raylib.js set entry game frame so we just do that otherwise otherwise we do our usual thing"
5870980,5874980," and load all loaded data texture phones audio here but we didn't really load anything did we"
5874980,5882420," i guess it's a template or something yeah i guess it's template and just end if so that's basically it"
5882420,5888100," so i'm not sure how well it is going to compile yeah it didn't compile uh because it needs to have a screen"
5888100,5893140," width uh by the way this one is interesting so there's extra stuff in here that is not needed"
5893140,5902500," um so it has these things uh we can move them to here right we can make them global i don't really know"
5902500,5910740," why they're not global already but now they are so uh use of and declared current screen where is the current"
5910740,5919620," screen uh where is it defined um am i going crazy"
5919620,5933380," okay so it's defined in here ah so that actually requires moving all of this state"
5934900,5943700," to here right it requires moving all of this state to here so we'll need to think about how to"
5943700,5951060," not require modification of the entry point because i remember that mscripten like had"
5951060,5958500," you know asyncify maybe we can do something with that as well right um so but that's going to be on the to-do list"
5960020,5965380," all right so uh yeah we don't have this function so it would be better to actually declare it somewhere"
5965380,5975060," core uh basic um where was that game dot c uh let's actually put it in them so let's put it in them"
5978180,5984900," all right seems cool seems cool seems cool uh now if i try to refresh this and i think uh"
5984900,5990980," it already works wait a second it already works wait for two seconds"
5990980,5998980," then it goes away and essentially it already has everything to implement all of that it just doesn't"
5998980,6005620," have a draw rectangle what the it just worked right like the beginning of this thing worked"
6005620,6010740," so let's go ahead and implement your rectangle that's actually so cool"
6010740,6016260," that's actually so cool all right all right um so draw rectangle"
6017780,6025940," uh ray lib dot h where is dot h do i have dot h draw uh rectangle so obviously like something"
6025940,6029780," is still wrong with the parameter so we need to still uh you know change it a little bit"
6029780,6036740," draw rectangle so this is a draw rectangle and i might as well just copy paste this entire thing"
6036740,6043700," and just like put it in here in a comment because i think it's useful so we have position x position y"
6043700,6047780," width and height and the color but the color is going to be just a pointer right the core is going"
6047780,6058580," to be just a pointer so uh now we need to extract the color out of this entire stuff so let me put that"
6058580,6064500," stuff in here with any text right so we take the buffer we take the core and stuff like that so and now"
6065860,6075460," now we can set the fill style to the color and then we can feel wrecked the chat chat chat do you feel wrecked"
6075460,6091380," sorry so uh let's actually check the uh you know the linta right can i check the winter use of"
6091380,6097380," and declare okay so okay that's actually very useful thank you stronger summer thank you really"
6097380,6102340," appreciate that it's actually very useful damn that's actually super useful i like this linter"
6102340,6107060," and especially like that it's just like a single fucking executable and it's just so fast and it's"
6107060,6112420," like yeah you can quickly check for some stuff before running it in the browser so we'll be like that"
6112420,6115700," uh okay so let's go ahead and do that boom"
6116740,6124660," um it just works it works exactly like in the original well i mean the the fonts are scuffed a"
6124660,6128580," little bit and we also need to check whether the key was pressed or something"
6128580,6140020," but here's the cool thing here's the cool thing um so the way it really works it it's not event based"
6140020,6147940," when it comes to input it checks the input each individual frame right it checks the input into each"
6147940,6154020," individual frame and essentially what we have to do we have to add event handlers to the canvas"
6154020,6163300," and uh basically collect uh what keys are pressed and on each frame on each frame uh and we know when the"
6163300,6170180," frame begins and the frame ends on each frame we uh have to look whether the key was pressed and answer"
6170180,6178340," yes or no and then when the user calls and drawing and by user i mean the programmer we clean up the uh"
6178340,6184260," list of already pressed keys so we basically keep collecting the pressed keys into list into the set"
6184260,6192260," and on android we keep cleaning it up that way we know uh what keys were pressed on which frame"
6192260,6198740," and then we can answer to the user is key that pressed or is it not and stuff like that so that's how"
6198740,6206100," really works it's not event based it's basically asked what happened on that frame right and it's the"
6206100,6212340," same with uh with mouse events right so it doesn't uh wait for events to come in it asks what's the"
6212340,6218500," position of mouse on the current frame so were any buttons of the mouse pressed on the current frame"
6218500,6223700," and it's actually a very interesting paradigm and it's like it fits well with immediate ui uh stuff"
6223700,6228100," it just pulls yeah it's basically pulling right so it i think that's the official name for this thing"
6228100,6233940," it's basically pulling roly pulling uh so we just need to organize that essentially we just need to"
6233940,6241460," organize that and does javascript has any sort of like sets right does it have any sets but i like that"
6241460,6250180," it just works it it feels like i'm implementing like a virtual machine right so i'm implementing raylib"
6250180,6258180," emulator uh so there are some sets okay so let's actually google that um all right javascript set"
6258180,6265620," it's it's very hacky and it's not applicable to any ray raylib application but"
6266900,6274820," if we manage to implement the 2d api of raylib this thing already will be immensely useful i think"
6274820,6281460," right if you have a very simple game that uses only 2d raylib uh it would be super easy to port it to to"
6281460,6286580," to web like that right if it doesn't use anything like super fancy like shaders or anything like that"
6286580,6292340," but even shaders are portable to this approach even shaders are portable i believe uh right so if you start"
6292340,6297860," going into webgl and stuff like that and webgl stream actually might be an interesting topic that"
6297860,6305700," i could do for for views and stuff like that so yeah yeah i think we're onto something i think i can milk"
6305700,6312100," this thing uh even if this thing is not going to be useful generally for anybody i'm creating this thing"
6312100,6318820," for myself actually because like i don't expect anybody to use that because i'm i'm pretty sure everybody's"
6318820,6324500," going to just use mscripten and that's fine that is certainly fine but i when i'm going to be using"
6324500,6330100," when i'm going to report my early publications to web i'm going to be using that i'm definitely going"
6330100,6335220," to be using that and i'm going to just simply implement only the api that my application uses"
6335220,6339140," and i'm going to just like keep maintaining maybe keep adding more functions and stuff like that"
6339860,6345700," uh right because i like to be in control of my dependencies so i like to be in control of my"
6345700,6358020," dependencies so yes you see you see sets so you can just do set object are collecting collections of"
6358020,6363860," values a value in the set may only occur once okay that's understandable that's understandable"
6365140,6370100," all right so let's create a set so what we have in here let pressed keys"
6370100,6379460," so so how do we check that do we check key down or a key up or something like that"
6379460,6390340," so if i go to basic is key pressed what constitutes a press right what constitutes constitutes a press oh when"
6390340,6398340," you hold it down okay so it's called pressed and there's also release okay uh pressed keys new sets"
6398340,6409620," so i suppose we just do that uh is gesture detected so what's funny is that maybe if we're gonna return"
6409620,6416660," something so gestures and what is a gesture is it like uh for mobile stuff it could be for mobile stuff"
6416660,6421300," actually uh check for just to have been detected so it's attached handling we can also support that"
6421300,6428500," uh believe it or not we can also try to support that um right because web browsers do have the"
6428500,6438420," like a gesture api and like a gesture stuff right so they do have it okay so let's go ahead into raylib.js"
6438420,6451380," and in a canvas we have to add event handler uh i don't remember how to do that event handler key pressed"
6451380,6454500," again i'm not a web developer right"
6454500,6464420," the key pressed returns true if the key was pressed uh was not pressed the last frame and is pressed this frame"
6464420,6474100," okay okay so they basically making sure right that the definition works even if you the implementer of"
6474100,6480900," api also use the polling right but we're not using polling we're receiving events right so for us uh"
6480900,6486020," checking that it was pressed is pretty easy did we receive the event yes that means it was pressed"
6486020,6490500," right so we're not using polling so we're not using polling so for us it doesn't really matter that much"
6490500,6494100," so key press all right um key press"
6499860,6518500," so add events is it events handler no it is not event handler"
6523620,6527300," oh event listener okay i think i think i'm actually a little bit tired already"
6527300,6532740," i'm already getting a little bit tired i'm sorry i'm sorry i have a lot of"
6532740,6537140," shit opened up by the way um yeah"
6537140,6546900," okay uh on key i suppose maybe on key press maybe"
6549460,6552180," uh um what was that"
6552180,6561540," key pressed"
6561540,6571780," so that's that's bizarre isn't it uh add event listener key press e"
6571780,6578500," so that should work let me close all this like it's just too much i keep forgetting where was the"
6579220,6582020," where was the thing that i was working on um"
6582020,6585140," maybe i should also make a small break"
6585140,6590420," okay open it please"
6590420,6599940," maybe because it was deprecated is there any notes"
6599940,6607700," usually web browsers show notes when something deprecated or something like that uh we can do key down"
6607700,6609460," right if that's something"
6609460,6613220," okay"
6613220,6621380," um so javascript key down event"
6621380,6628100," why is it you show me russian websites that's just like"
6628100,6630500," it's usually not useful"
6632820,6633460," um"
6633460,6637540," it needs to have focus"
6637540,6643060," how can i make it focus"
6643060,6654340," you know what uh i think i want to make small break uh right because i'm also losing focus so and after"
6654340,6661140," the break we're going to continue all right so let's actually straight up google up um how to"
6661140,6666340," you know handle key events in a in a canvas right so i think that will be actually useful"
6666340,6675780," key uh events on canvas html5 javascript and let's use google right so there's probably like a complete"
6675780,6682900," example uh best way to create key of a create or create handle uh or listen"
6682900,6692420," google don't don't be okay create apparently we're doing create um right so on the window all right so"
6692420,6698740," that makes sense maybe maybe we should have actually done that on the window uh sure so this is a key down uh"
6698740,6707540," uh and uh we'll just do the the usual thing okay okay uh let's see if that's going to solve any of"
6707540,6713380," our problems uh right so it does in fact okay so i just had to do that on a on a window that makes"
6713380,6719700," sense that actually makes sense so what we're going to do uh is uh do we have pressed keys in"
6719700,6724660," here uh maybe i can make it a little bit bigger okay can you guys see everything uh so we have pressed"
6724660,6734740," keys all right um yeah so this is one of the advantages of having like these global variables"
6734740,6739860," uh like this is that you can then just use them in a in the dev tools which is extremely convenient and"
6739860,6745780," then i can maybe add something and what kind of stuff can we even add there right so we can try to add"
6745780,6755860," the codes so there is a code key s uh but we are kind of interested in key code key code uh so let's"
6755860,6768500," just go ahead and do that so pressed keys uh add e key code and we are basically done believe it or not"
6768500,6775060," i would like to check the linter linter seems to be fine and another thing i would like to do is when we end"
6775060,6781940," rendering the frame when we end the rendering the frame uh can i do uh pressed keys clear"
6781940,6789060," right is that something that exists uh compilation it's is that is that clear or is it is it something"
6789060,6798340," else uh pressed keys uh clear yeah it is clear so by the way can quick or lean thingy how is it called"
6798340,6803780," quickly in js like handle things that don't exist in the set right so it doesn't check this kind of thing"
6803780,6808980," okay so that's that's fair so it's it's a little bit simpler than i thought originally but i mean it's"
6808980,6815700," already pretty useful for for what it is uh i can see myself using it uh it's probably going to become"
6815700,6822660," better and better so i'm pretty sure more stuff is going to be added here um is key pressed okay uh is"
6823540,6830180," key pressed um and it accepts the code right is key pressed"
6830180,6847860," is key pressed i suppose key and we can just check pressed keys uh why didn't you okay contains"
6849700,6860580," has has has has okay pressed keys has key and i suppose we can just return that okay i suppose we can just"
6860580,6872980," return that all right so and let's see what we have uh okay is gesture detected we can just put a stop gap in"
6872980,6883300," there uh is gesture uh how how is it called gesture gesture detected"
6883300,6900900," detected identifier i forgot a comma in here by the way it could be actually caught yeah yeah there we go"
6900900,6905780," missing common between object and channel this is actually useful this is better error message than this"
6905780,6914980," shit yeah that is already better error message than that okay that's cool uh waiting two seconds"
6914980,6924660," uh so what about enter it doesn't handle that thing though right it doesn't handle it so"
6925300,6934340," what's what's the key code of enter in raylib so key enter it's 257 and why is it 257"
6934340,6947620," so and in our case the code raylib.js raylib.js is something else we might as well actually log that yet again"
6947620,6961860," console log key code um yeah key down so this is a key down um right and let me see so it's 13."
6961860,6967060," why is it like that so do we even have 13 here"
6968660,6975540," hmm so there is ascii stuff there is ascii stuff there is ascii stuff and there is these things so this is"
6975540,6982740," space and this is enter uh this is space and this is enter uh this is space and this is enter"
6982740,6996260," hmm i wonder if this corresponds to anything or is it just like a random is it just random where did they get that"
6996260,7005460," uh it's an ascii code for cr yeah yeah it's an ascii code for cr i wonder like what's the meaning behind"
7005460,7012740," this thing uh it's glfw let's explore the source code of raylib like literally maybe there we can"
7012740,7020500," find some information about that there so key uh maybe we can start is key pressed right so we can start"
7020500,7027620," with this thing because if there's some sort of a meaning behind them uh we can exploit that so max"
7027620,7034740," keyboard keys right if it's between that stuff uh and there is a current key and there is a previous one"
7034740,7045540," um okay so that means somewhere in the code we set in those things so how do we even set them how do we even"
7045540,7051060," set them so let's actually find all of the places where we refer to this thing uh that's quite a few"
7051060,7059380," places all right so core uh i think this one is more interesting um so we just check stuff in here"
7059380,7067300," uh uh so here we set it to true okay this is cool play automation of it uh it's just automation of them"
7068020,7072260," uh-huh so there is that it's also automation event"
7072260,7083380," so it's our core desktop so this is probably where all of that is going on okay key callback"
7083380,7094420," key callback uh okay so it comes from glfw all of that shit comes from glfw all right so and how do we set"
7094420,7104420," that thing um so this is key callback uh there's a bunch of key callbacks so this is web uh and on the"
7104420,7111460," desktop yeah so okay so it's just straight up set as the key callback and it's the same"
7113860,7117940," it's the same thing all right so they're completely dependent on glfw"
7117940,7130820," uh so glfw uh key crews jello w key calls all right keyboard key tokens is there any information about"
7130820,7139220," that so we can even find key enter and it's 257 okay is there any information like what's the meaning"
7139220,7147460," behind them so these key codes are inspired by usb hid usage tables but rearrange to map to 7-bit ascii"
7147460,7155300," from printable characters uh function function keys are put into 256 range the naming of the key codes"
7155300,7161700," follow the rules the us keyboard layout is used names of printable alpha characters are used ar3 blah blah"
7161700,7169460," blah blah for non-numeric characters unicode blah blah blah keys that lack a clear us mapping world x"
7169460,7178900," for non-pretable keys custom names are used so what we can do in here what we can do in here maybe we"
7178900,7191380," should organize some sort of a mapping uh from maybe even uh like a key code that we receive from the"
7191380,7197140," browser right we need to actually mimic the uh this kind of stuff in here as well so let's actually print"
7197140,7208020," the whole event so then um oh yeah i supposed to actually say something okay so in here we have a code"
7208020,7218660," right so for example uh key s and we can try to map these codes these names to uh the glfw you know codes"
7218660,7228820," because um oh yeah you just kind of would uh our core web not have to remap this yeah so they compile"
7228820,7234980," like a web version of jlw or something like that which is kind of a little bit of an overkill right"
7235940,7242980," because the browser basically has the functionality of jlow browser is jlow right"
7242980,7252420," it's just a different api right it's just a different api and we're trying to use jlow as the"
7252420,7259620," thing that abstracts away browser capabilities but then raylib is also the thing that tries to abstract"
7259620,7267300," way the browser capabilities so even with such things as raylib we have layers and layers and layers of"
7267300,7275060," adapters to different apis um so in fact browser has so much fucking shit other than jlow yeah exactly"
7275060,7283060," uh in fact so and that's the reason why i'm trying to do this thing that i'm doing is that because browser"
7283060,7291860," basically has all of the functionality of raylib basically so anything really can do browser can do"
7291860,7301060," that so your job is just to rewire the capabilities of the browser to the api of raylib so yeah you have"
7301060,7309060," two apis two apis you just have to adapt one api to another one um and to do that right now with raylib web"
7309620,7316420," you have layers of other things that also are supposed to adapt some other apis to other apis"
7316420,7324100," and it's just it's craziness um so but that's the world we we live in right so that's the world we live"
7324100,7329380," in so and again whatever i'm doing i don't expect it to be useful for anyone except myself so i'm making"
7329380,7340260," this thing for myself purely um so r control alt etc are modifies and relief or just same case i don't"
7340260,7353220," know you can look it up in here um okay um so let's see so if i press enter if i press enter what do we have"
7353220,7363940," so it's the key code the code is enter so for now uh we can do if e key can i just switch this thing is"
7363940,7374900," that something i can do key code um case uh and just enter i'm pretty sure you can do switch cases on these"
7374900,7385300," things uh so pressed keys uh add 257 right so it's 257"
7385300,7393060," so what we can do can we just have a mapping"
7394580,7402820," uh something like this uh something like this const uh glfw key mapping and we can do something like"
7402820,7414180," this enter 257 and then we can probably add more uh right we can probably add more uh so"
7415060,7427940," then we can do joww key mapping and i suppose i can just do key code and add that to pressed keys"
7427940,7436660," yeah emacs don't be slow please thank you so much emacs right so for now we only have enter but i mean"
7436660,7440980," you can extend that if you want to uh right if you need to as well"
7442740,7452180," all right so wait in two seconds and then if i press enter didn't work bruv bruv it didn't work"
7452180,7454020," why it didn't work"
7454020,7459140," jesus christ stop spamming"
7459140,7462580," um"
7462580,7470580," okay so the example it seems to be working"
7472100,7477940," uh so we just parted another example it looks kind of a bit off if you know what i'm talking about"
7477940,7489300," right it looks a bit off uh and so basic screen managing right so yeah so i suppose"
7489300,7500260," maybe it is too big or maybe something is off we could try we could try to adjust that parameter a little"
7500260,7506900," bit so is there a six what if what if it was 55 uh yeah i need to open"
7506900,7514260," devtools okay okay refresh please it didn't really help so"
7514260,7520660," i'm really not sure where oh i think i know what the is going on"
7522420,7531860," so the position is calculated differently the position is straight up calculated differently and i suppose"
7531860,7542820," maybe we have to add the um the height factor or something like the size of this entire thing um"
7543780,7556500," so the font size is the font size and we can also try to add the font size position to here"
7556500,7561540," uh and see if it's going to work or not yeah that worked"
7561540,7565300," that actually worked perfectly"
7567140,7576100," yo what the so we also have click and i don't know where the click is coming from uh core screen"
7576100,7582740," manager um i suppose it's coming from the gesture right it is coming from the gesture but yeah"
7582740,7585060," so yeah we ported this thing"
7587140,7592820," so that's so fucking cool isn't that cool like we ported this thing without them scripting right and"
7592820,7597620," so it's just like it wasn't that super hard i don't think so right"
7597620,7607300," so it's around six maybe it could be seven"
7610020,7622020," just a little bit it's kind of weird that it doesn't use the um you know the size of the text to uh you"
7622020,7629300," know align it properly right it doesn't use that uh but yeah that's cool that's really cool so we"
7629300,7638660," ported two examples in here uh so far we ported two examples so there's also a couple of uh but yeah"
7640500,7647940," i want to go back to the first example and what do we have in here right so where's the wasn't dot"
7647940,7656260," wasn't so basic window right so we created the basic window in here uh congrats you you created your"
7656260,7662420," first window okay so and go back in here uh so it would be kind of nice to be able to switch between"
7662420,7668820," different examples and everything okay so let's go ahead and commit whatever we managed to do"
7670020,7684100," uh right so look at that look at that uh port core basic uh basic screen manager example"
7684100,7691700," all right i'm gonna push that right into the repo so in essentially the process of like figuring all of"
7691700,7697300," that stuff out is like that right it's like implementing a virtual machine you're taking"
7697300,7703540," examples and you just like you know mess with the thing until it works then another one then another"
7703540,7710820," one and uh while doing all of that you also gather a lot of information about like what other things you"
7710820,7717300," could do or maybe you will eventually come up with a better approach completely and start over right but"
7717300,7722660," already with the knowledge that could help you to to improve the whole system and make it better"
7722660,7729300," so uh this is more like a research and gathering information but again this is the reason why i"
7729300,7734260," think it is doable right remember how in the previous stream i said it's it's like a lot of work but"
7734260,7741780," it's doable right so and that's the result right and it's not like uh you can't use this thing until"
7741780,7747860," you fully implement it so here's the thing it is not fully implemented that is true but it doesn't"
7747860,7755060," mean it's useless that's the thing doesn't mean it's useless if you use only the functions that"
7755060,7762100," already implemented you can use this thing so yeah so that's already kind of useful right for some"
7762100,7767940," situations and then uh maybe you have example that uses function that is not implemented in here but"
7767940,7772900," it's a couple of functions you can implement it and make this thing a little bit more useful then"
7772900,7776980," somebody else comes with a different thing and they implement a couple of functions and so on and so"
7776980,7786500," forth um you do more work but you get less uh moving uh pieces at the end there is an open issue now"
7786500,7794180," because of mscript and breaking compiling for its new versions exactly right it boils down to the thing i"
7794180,7800980," i was talking about about predictability of the problems right so you use them script and you get"
7800980,7806420," problems that you don't know of and you can't predict them because you don't control that dependency"
7806420,7814580," right so you you're always gonna have problems you're always gonna have problems but you have to make a"
7814580,7821780," decision you you you need to choose between the problems you don't control and basically play gamble all the"
7821780,7830660," time or the problems that you're afraid to face but you can control them right so in software engineering"
7830660,7835860," like control over the situation is the most important thing in my opinion because if you control the"
7835860,7844020," situation you can plan it yeah uh i don't know so i don't know i don't know so i'm gonna leave the"
7844580,7850660," project as it is i don't know if i'm gonna stream more of this thing uh my plan for this project is"
7850660,7857460," i'm gonna be looking into pull requests from time to time if you have any pull requests or suggestions"
7857460,7863780," so i can merge them or answer to them and stuff like that and when the time comes and i need to port"
7863780,7871460," some application to raylib uh i'll be using that for myself i do not recommend like using this thing"
7871460,7876580," for you right and i'm not saying that it's going to replace uh raylib web uh what i'm saying is that"
7876580,7883780," it's an alternative research project that i do for myself and if it's accidentally useful for you well"
7883780,7890500," that's great right and if like you this thing is useful for you but it misses a couple of functions and"
7890500,7896660," you implement those couple of functions that is also great so yeah that's basically my conclusion"
7896660,7903140," on uh this sort of like journey of exploring web web capabilities of raylib maybe i will do more"
7903140,7908100," streams on that maybe not we'll see so and uh yeah that's basically it"
7908100,7915620," implementing shaders with webgl would be interesting i do i do think so i actually agree with that so maybe"
7915620,7921460," it's gonna be one of the streams that i could do uh right because uh one of the layers that"
7921460,7928500," raylib has is our rlgl right so basically it ties together um you know different versions of opengl right"
7928500,7933940," if you write a code that uses rlgl it will work on several versions of opengl without like modifications"
7933940,7937700," and stuff like that what if one of those versions of opengl would be webgl"
7939540,7945620," that will be interesting so we can port specifically rlgl and maybe all the code that depends on rlgl will"
7945620,7948660," work automatically with that but everything but yeah"
7948660,7957140," so anyway uh that's it for today thanks everyone who's watching me right now i really appreciate that"
7957140,7966100," have a good one and i see you all on the next recreation programming session with mr zozin i love you"
