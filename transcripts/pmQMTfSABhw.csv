160,4960," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another"
4960,12320," recreational programming session not really but maybe we'll see we'll see uh let's make a little"
12320,17120," bit of a tiny bit of an announcement and maybe officially start the stream we'll see we'll see"
17120,24320," the winner gets t that's for sure uh red circle live on twitch and what are we doing today on"
24320,34960," twitch.a television a website today uh the topic of today's stream is ask me something right so"
34960,41200," essentially i wanted to stream something today but i uh didn't have any prepared content right i didn't"
41200,47040," have any prepared interesting topic uh to stream but i still wanted to stream so i decided that"
47040,53680," maybe you decide the the topic of today's stream like maybe you ask something so let me give the"
53680,60560," link to where we do all that uh so twitch dot tv slash studying and i'm going to ping everyone"
60560,67840," who's interested in being pinged uh right so what if you uh start by asking me questions right um"
67840,76080," regarding programming and uh i'll try to answer them but i'm going to try to answer them more or less like"
76080,81920," legit not in a snarky usual way right so for example you may ask me like"
83040,90000," what text editor should i learn and i would legit try to answer that that would have been interesting"
90000,97680," um is your ethernet better uh yes it is but i'm not streaming from ethernet this time uh i forgot to"
97680,104800," actually connect it so um the stream might be actually very unreliable uh right now so i'm still"
104800,112400," rather i'll rely on wi-fi yes uh is port a finish i suppose you mean port uh the development of course"
112400,119760," is kind of paused uh right so and uh i will get to that at some point so as you can see sometimes i"
119760,126000," actually pause some projects and work on something else and then maybe in a year i can come back to that"
126000,133360," so you never know uh do you have a c course really like how you explain things i don't really have any"
133360,141680," courses at all to be fair like i don't really teach people despite uh what it might look like"
141680,147360," it might look like i teach something but i don't really teach people what i do is just like i sit down"
147360,153120," and work on the projects that i like to work and i hope that maybe people can learn from that but i do"
153120,160560," not intentionally teach something and in fact i don't really know how to teach people programming uh from"
160560,168800," scratch like i have no idea like how to teach person c like i don't even know how to approach that like"
168800,177520," how do i teach a person c who doesn't know c uh where to start like i have no idea honestly so that's"
177520,184160," that's probably why um i i just don't have any courses right so maybe i should start working that"
184160,191040," i could could have taken like the c programming language book as the base as the list of topics and"
191040,199200," i could basically give my take on each individual topic in that book and call that a course and maybe sell it"
200480,209520," and become rich that's a cool video actually i'll think about that uh i have a question if you run"
209520,214080," your threads on multiple cores why would you use multi-processing"
214080,226240," i mean isn't that basically synonymous isn't that basically synonymous like multi-threading and like"
226240,234880," multiple course and multiple multiple processing so as far as i know course is basically processors but"
234880,244720," on a single crystal effectively so multiple course is multiple processors but on a single crystal so"
244720,252160," this is how i understand that uh right so but i might be wrong so for me this sounds like uh synonyms"
252160,258080," multi-processing multi-core same thing effectively effectively same thing so maybe i should actually"
258080,264080," like let the chat scroll right so and whatever question i actually pick is going to be like picked"
264080,274080," what you just specifically pick uh c and not c plus plus c is simpler right and uh yeah because it's"
274080,281040," simpler it's it's easier to use a c plus plus is very complicated uh and it's growing constantly"
281040,287440," and at some point implementing like a compiler for c plus plus can become and completely like"
287440,296400," unmanageable manageable task but if you write your applications in c c is simple enough that maybe in"
296400,303600," the future when there will be no c compilers my hope is it is easy enough to write your own c compiler and"
303600,309040," still maintain your software that is written in c right you see what i'm talking about you see what i'm"
309040,317040," talking about um right so essentially if you have an old piece of software um written in c in the far"
317040,322000," far future it's going to be way easier to resurrect that piece of software than the piece of software"
322000,328880," that is written in c plus plus um right because it's easier to write a compiler for c than for c plus plus"
328880,336000," so your piece of code in that language survives longer so i'm thinking like uh when i'm developing software i'm"
336000,341520," thinking about it like in decades of maintenance right so how my software is going to be used in"
341520,348560," 10 years in 20 years in 30 years in 50 years and the probability of c being a thing in 50 years is way"
348560,355520," higher than c plus plus because simpler things survive right simply use the thing things survive"
356960,361920," so you know how exciting if someone made an efficient compiler for javascript would that be a net benefit"
361920,369680," for the world somebody already did that somebody is google and that compiler is v8 or what is it called"
369680,377680," like javascript core or whatever like i mean the uh all the modern javascript interpreters are javascript"
377680,384880," compilers they're called jit compilers they're actually compiling your javascript to native sequence of"
384880,393040," instructions yes javascript is a compiled language it compiles to native code before executing it's"
393040,398560," called just-in-time compilation so would it be a net benefit for humanity well do you see a net benefit"
398560,405760," for humanity right so is the current state of the web looks like a benefit for humanity to you"
405760,411760," and that's the answer so that's the answer to your question"
416560,424960," do you know windows pe file format i know that it exists do you prefer elf or pe format i don't really"
424960,431280," have any preference because i don't usually work on the level of these formats i don't really generate"
431280,438400," these formats i don't uh you know crack them unpack them i do nothing with them for me they're just"
438400,445280," the difference between them for me is just like difference between mp4 and av they're different video"
445280,450400," containers but what's the difference for me i i don't care i just need a video right so"
450400,458560," so i i don't know like how for myself evaluate the difference between these two formats right so there"
458560,464400," are just two containers for holding instructions for my programs right so from that point of view i don't"
464400,469840," care but since i'm using linux most of the time it's probably going to be elf but this is because that's"
469840,475040," what linux support if i were using windows i would be preferring pe because that's what"
475040,485280," windows support right so if that makes any sense uh would you implement a hash map in c uh i think i"
485280,491520," already did some time ago but uh that's actually sounds very interesting right so maybe i'm gonna"
491520,497840," put that down as a to-do because that could be actually a very cool video that is easy to market"
498560,501280," and uh easy for people to google"
501280,512080," uh so we have a question in russian language how many times you have to force yourself to do projects"
512880,522560," so it becomes a habit oh i don't really know like as many times as you do anything to make anything in a"
522560,535360," habit i suppose um to be fair like you just need to find a project that you actually enjoy right it's kind of"
535360,543520," sounds like easy to say than to do uh but a lot of people and myself included got into programming"
543520,551120," through um modding games right back in my days i'm relatively old software developer i'm not as"
551120,557200," old as people like jonathan blore or casey moratori uh but i'm relatively old so i'm sort of middle-aged"
557200,564480," developer and uh i got into programming uh through making maps for warcraft 3 right because i was avid"
564480,570640," gamer i like to play games right my school grades were really bad uh they were extremely bad because"
570640,577760," i've been playing video games all the time right and uh so i really liked warcraft 3 and i found a map"
577760,583840," editor and that's what hooked me in so because that combined programming with something that i really"
583840,591840," really like so from what i heard these days people have a very similar situation but with minecraft"
591840,598640," right so i heard that a lot of programmers um got into programming through modding minecraft"
598640,605520," so maybe you have your favorite activity like that maybe you have a game your favorite game"
605520,610160," and maybe there is a modding community for that game maybe you want to look into that"
610160,616560," right it has to be something that you enjoy uh right if you are a musician you may look into"
616560,621840," uh programming music or something like a programming sound so maybe generating midi"
621840,627760," right so you need to find the thing that you already like and combine that with programming you need to"
627760,633680," associate that your favorite thing with programming and that's how you hook yourself into making different"
633680,639360," projects and stuff like that so that's how it works for me that's how it works for many people uh so"
639360,645520," maybe it will work for you so that's my advice for you on how to how to start um your english is really"
645520,654160," good how did you learn it i learned it in a very painful way actually i worked in outsource right"
655680,662800," so essentially uh at some point i you know got hired by an outsource company that worked for"
662800,668320," western clients and i was just thrown into the english-speaking environment and it was said"
668320,675840," speak english that was extremely stressful but at the same time it forced myself to learn this language"
675840,681920," very quickly right so because uh whether i stay in the company would depend on how quickly i pick up the"
681920,690560," language and i picked up the basics relatively quickly and so i started to improve my english since then"
690560,698320," right so by then listening to youtube videos and stuff like that so uh right so that's how i learned"
698320,705200," english if that makes any sense and after that i started to stream and streams provided even more uh"
705200,713120," you know experience for you know practice for for this kind of stuff why don't you stream on youtube"
713120,723920," i have no idea so essentially before 2022 i didn't stream because i had a contract these days i think"
723920,730160," my contract is not really working that well anymore plus i think it's a completely different so i think"
730160,737040," there is no exclusivity clause in the contract anymore i think so i could stream on youtube"
737040,743280," but i just need to learn how to do that so it's sort of like a force of a habit it's sort of like a force"
743280,754480," of a habit so yeah um why emacs uh i i think there is i mean i can use vim by the way so for those who doesn't"
754480,762160," know i literally can program in vim so it's not a problem for me so i even have vim and i would say"
762160,770800," that i'm basically as efficient in vim as in c plus as in emacs basically right so this this is how i use"
770800,780480," vim right so i even know how to exit it so i can use vim it's not a question for me why i prefer vim over"
780480,786800," like emacs over vim or vim over emacs like i know both of them i can use both of them relatively"
786800,796240," efficiently like right so um so essentially but i mastered i think emacs first and only then vim"
796240,803920," um right and the reason the reason is actually pretty dumb why i made the decision to actually focus on emacs"
803920,810000," and not on vim because at some point i was just like trying to think okay which cool editor i have"
810000,815040," to master right so which cool editor i have to master is it going to be emacs is it going to view"
815040,819680," and that was at the time by the way my friends where we didn't have visual studio code"
819680,827920," it didn't exist at the time when i was making the decision which editor to learn emacs or vim"
827920,836160," that's how i old kids visual studio code simply didn't exist like it was not a thing there was"
836160,843840," only vim and emacs that's it so and how did i make the the decision it's actually very interesting and"
843840,849840," very dumb at the same time so you see in emacs you have your way of navigating which is actually rather"
849840,856240," efficient uh you use ctrl n ctrl p ctrl f ctrl b and if you get used to that it's actually rather efficient"
856240,862560," it is actually rather efficient vim has even more efficient way of uh you know navigating and stuff"
862560,868240," like that so you have b w you can jump by words you can jump stuff like that and everything and"
868240,879200," my problem was as soon as you type colon and go down into this prompt all of your fancy navigation tools go"
879760,887360," get thrown out of the window they just straight up get thrown out of the window where in emacs if you"
887360,893920," press uh mx uh like you see you can still use the same way of navigating as you do in the main window"
893920,900320," and that was literally the point of decision this is how i made the decision okay i'm going to use emacs from"
900320,909680," now on but i didn't know that in vim you can press ctrl f in here and you can just use a prompt in here"
909680,914800," where you can do the usual navigations in vim i just didn't know that at the time and in fact i learned"
914800,926080," that this year if somebody showed me if somebody showed me that you can do that in vim like 10 years"
926080,932880," ago i would be probably not be using emacs right now so that's literally it's as dumb as that there is no"
932880,939600," like some sort of like a you know mystery behind why you it's just that it's as dumb as that"
939600,947760," so yeah that's that's the great greatest secret on why zozin uses that goddamn emac"
947760,953600," because of that i didn't know 10 years ago that you can do that in vim if i knew i would probably use vim"
957680,965440," so does that answer your questions about like why zozin uses"
965440,974560," yes the reality is extremely dumb and conventional coding thank you so much for tier one with the"
974560,980640," message i've never heard you slurp ut is it cold or something i can slurp it just for you is that your"
980640,990880," fetish wait did you literally pay me to satisfy your fetish you dirty bastard how do we come better in"
990880,1001120," programming you just do it you you know the answer you know the answer you just do it how did i become"
1001840,1005760," like good at programming i've been programming since 2006"
1005760,1009600," two thousand six"
1009600,1020640," i've been programming since then so what's what's your uh it is right now right so it's 2023 2006 right and"
1020640,1031440," maybe you want to sort of add one so 18 years which is pretty quick so yeah so program for as long as this"
1032400,1038480," and you will be as good as me maybe even better because i'm pretty dumb person right so the only"
1038480,1044320," reason why i'm good at programming is is because i've been just like grinding it for 18 years because i"
1044320,1052560," thought it's cool and it's going to be a good investment in the future and then chat gpt came in so"
1054560,1057120," there you go"
1057120,1068240," uh what is recreation programming and what's the difference uh than normal programming so recreation"
1068240,1074400," programming is basically the same idea as recreational math right so let's google up recreational math"
1075680,1082320," uh right so recreational math uh recreational mathematics is mathematics carried out for"
1082320,1089040," recreational uh yeah created for recreation rather than uh a strict research and application based"
1089040,1094880," professional activity or as part of the student formal education so it's kind of interesting concept"
1094880,1100240," right that not a lot of people can understand but there is like a whole group of people that do"
1100240,1108480," math recreationally just for the sake of doing math just to replicate so-called mathematical experience i"
1108480,1114480," actually heard people use that combination of words that phrase mathematical experience"
1114480,1121200," uh it's it's so it's almost sounds like a religious experience but it's a mathematical experience when you"
1121200,1125760," so carry out the computations and when you're exploring the formulas and stuff like that"
1125760,1134560," and in fact uh i think pythagoreans were even like making a cult out of mathematics so yeah so"
1134560,1139440," people sometimes even making calls out of the mathematics so this is a recreational mathematics"
1139440,1146000," and an analog of that for me would be recreational programming right so it's programming"
1146000,1152080," for the same reasons people do recreational mathematics so that's basically the idea right it's"
1152080,1160400," it's programming as a recreational activity for the sake of programming uh right for the sake of programming"
1160400,1161360," so"
1161360,1171120," so there was a good question i really like that what's your comment about chat gpt so uh chat gpt"
1171120,1179040," it's pretty useful um tool all right so which is more probably more useful than google and uh specifically"
1179040,1187600," i suppose in the context of programming right so like how what's my opinion on programming using chat gpt"
1187600,1196320," so from the programming point of view chat gpt is a non-deterministic compiler from nature language to a"
1196320,1204880," programming language so that's what it is and uh it could be useful for like generating the first"
1204880,1211680," approximation approximation of the solution but then you would have to go on your own from from that"
1211680,1218080," right then you will have to go from your own and that and this is the problem because first of"
1218080,1225200," all it's a non-deterministic compiler that means that the same piece of code aka prompt may generate"
1225920,1232800," different results that have different results that have different behaviors that is already very bad for"
1232800,1237360," reproducibility and reliability of the software so this is the first thing"
1237360,1244960," second of all you're using nature language for telling computer how to do things you're using the"
1244960,1250240," language that is not designed for writing instructions for computer to carry out"
1251360,1258080," so not only the results of your program aka prompt are not reproducible consistently because it's a"
1258080,1263840," non-deterministic compiler you're using language that is not designed for writing programs for computers"
1264720,1272000," so it may look impressive it may look cool like a shiny new tool but in the long term it's more"
1272000,1277920," difficult to write programs like that because it's like all these things go against you writing a reliable"
1277920,1284240," software but maybe that's okay because nobody expects software to be reliable anymore so maybe that's fine"
1284240,1294720," maybe that's exactly what we want so and uh interestingly like people were using nature languages to describe"
1294720,1301200," math for a long time until they realized that the natural language is not suitable for doing that and"
1301200,1308320," they invented mathematical notation so in mathematics we actually observed a reversed process where we had"
1308320,1314320," natural language then turned into a formal strict language that is more suitable for mathematics but"
1314320,1320640," for some reason in computers and in computing we do that in reverse we had a strict mathematical language"
1320640,1325760," that is suitable for writing computer programs and we're going towards more natural one with that"
1325760,1331920," is not suitable for that and it's kind of weird so it's kind of upside down i do not understand that"
1331920,1337520," it's interesting in the moment it's an interesting novelty it may even speed up the performance for"
1338320,1345360," tasks but in the long run we're not using the right tools for the tasks you know what i'm talking about"
1345360,1353040," it's i feel like it right so it's just like my opinion on using chat gpt specifically for programming"
1353040,1358720," chat gpt is more versatile tool you can use it not only for programming right so you can use it for more"
1358720,1364320," different things but if we look at it through the prism of programming this is my opinion on that thing"
1364960,1372960," so um very uh very sure this question already got asked multiple times and i also think that this"
1372960,1381440," question is a bit vague uh but how would you learn to code if you could start over again uh so if i"
1381440,1390080," how would i learn to code if i were to i would probably try to like these days i would try to google"
1390640,1396400," or maybe chat like ask chat gpt and maybe start from there"
1396400,1408720," uh so i don't really know because how did i learn programming right so i was just experimenting so the"
1408720,1413920," cool thing about warcraft 3 right so i already told that story multiple times i learned this kind of stuff"
1413920,1422960," through warcraft 3 uh right and it it had a map editor and it had a system of triggers so essentially"
1422960,1431840," you would have different events that happened within the map uh right so somebody died or a certain unit"
1431840,1439440," crossed a particular area you could select an area so some sort of trigger area and you can assign a script"
1440560,1446720," you could assign a script on that specific area and you know what's funny about this uh scripting language"
1446720,1455440," is that you would like physically edit ast of the script right so it's kind of difficult to"
1455440,1464240," to to show okay can we actually find that warcraft uh craft three uh map editor trigger"
1466400,1470960," can we find something about that because it's kind of difficult to explain how it looks like but it"
1470960,1478640," it was like a visual yeah this one something like this right it's like i would like to have like a bigger"
1478640,1487920," resolution uh i'm not sure if bigger resolution exists it's yeah something something like this but not really so"
1487920,1496000," essentially here you have different actions and those are like literal nodes in a tree and you could actually expand them"
1496400,1511520," add an if construction in here and you could expand expand then an else branch and within that you could add more things"
1511520,1524400," you wouldn't edit text you don't edit text you literally say insert um insert even here uh insert call to certain thing and so on and so forth"
1524400,1529680," it also had a textual representation of the scripting language but i mean a lot of people were just"
1529680,1536080," like using this sort of editor it's more like a like scratch i would say it's more like scratch"
1536080,1544720," and uh yeah so essentially i learned different constructions different constructions by just"
1544720,1551440," seeing them and experimenting with them and seeing how they behave so that's how we learn it and i think"
1551440,1558640," it's a good way to learn this basic concept right and how would i do that if i didn't know that like i"
1558640,1564560," would probably try to find something like that so i suppose something like that exists in a form of scratch"
1565440,1573360," but the problem with scratch is that i heard people don't really like uh scratch in a sense that it feels"
1573360,1580640," like it's for kids this is one of the arguments against scratch that i heard like um so getting into"
1580640,1586320," programming through scratch it feels kind of humiliating for some people because they feel like"
1586320,1591840," it's it's for kids so for this thing this thing doesn't feel that humiliating because it doesn't feel like"
1591840,1597760," for kids it looks like you're playing a cool game warcraft 3 and you look making your your own map"
1597760,1606000," editor like holy so it doesn't feel like it's for kids it feels cool right it's like scratch but cool"
1606000,1613920," i think we need something like that what if we had like something like scratch but without this kiddish"
1613920,1619760," theme more serious stuff that would have been interesting i think there was something like a luna"
1619760,1626880," programming language that was like a visual editing or something like blueprints by the way learning"
1626880,1634320," programming through maybe blueprints in like unreal engine or something like that right so yeah that would"
1634320,1635040," be actually kind of cool"
1635040,1644480," what's cool about this uh this kind of thing is that you could discover these constructions"
1644480,1650400," right so when you're learning programming through just a text editor where you have to type characters"
1650400,1656880," you can't discover any of these constructions in a text editor you need somebody to tell you that you"
1656880,1663440," need to put combination of characters if and then maybe name of the variable and stuff like that to to"
1663440,1670000," actually do these kind of things right but here you can just find the block and put in here you can find"
1670000,1676080," the block and put in here and discover the property of that block so you can discover things on yourself"
1676080,1680560," it's really difficult to learn programming in a text editor where you have characters and stuff like that"
1680560,1687280," because it's not discoverable like you have just an empty text editor you know nothing about programming"
1687280,1694720," and they tell you and like what do you learn like how do you discover things"
1694720,1705680," so i don't know so um to start probably from complete scratch yourself um you need something like that"
1705680,1712080," i think you need something like that somebody's suggesting zaktronic zaktronics games i think they're"
1712080,1719040," also kind of cool for that uh what's the best way to ditch oop for game development also what language"
1719040,1728080," would you use uh so i don't really know it i suppose it depends on the engine right so maybe you use an"
1728080,1735840," engine where you can't avoid oop and what would i use uh for game development i would just use c and"
1735840,1741760," probably ray leap so because that's the simplest setup and a i probably would make a simple game"
1741760,1746720," but if i were to make a game i would make something simple and i would use c and ray leap but i'm not"
1746720,1756560," a game developer neither amateur nor professional one so i have no expertise to talk about game development"
1756560,1764560," whatsoever um so yeah i don't really know why people ask me the game development question like i'm not a"
1764560,1771760," game developer like at all uh go john go ask jonathan blow but i mean i'm pretty sure he's he's not gonna"
1771760,1778480," answer any of your questions about game development because people ask him too too many of them um hi turning"
1778480,1785360," my career role does not involve much of programming i'm more of a programmer but didn't start as one how can i"
1785360,1792800," switch my career i have no idea honestly i know like i don't really like to answer career question"
1792800,1799360," because i personally as a programmer don't really care about career because if i did i would not be a streamer"
1799360,1810000," so yeah my problem is that i like programming as an activity way more than i care about career in it"
1810960,1821280," like i just don't care so uh so and the reason why i kind of quit it completely is because precisely"
1821280,1828240," because of what you said there's less programming in software development like apparently people don't"
1828240,1836320," need programming anymore like we're doing like anything but programming and yeah so i don't have an answer to"
1836320,1843280," your question i'm sorry i wish i wish somebody answered that question for me too right so how"
1843280,1849360," can i switch career so i do more programming because even after i quit software development and became a"
1849360,1855840," streamer that streams programming i still more than half of my work is editing goddamn votes and preparing"
1855840,1863680," new topics instead of actually coding so yeah i still didn't get my dream come true unfortunately"
1863680,1871760," how can i where can i do actual programming do we even need programming anymore like it's just like is"
1871760,1877840," it even needed activity nobody cares about it apparently so i don't freaking know i don't freaking know my"
1877840,1884480," new friend i don't freaking know favorite anime i didn't watch anime i'm sorry please don't hate me like i"
1884480,1894480," i i was trying to get into anime but i just i just can't it's it's boring i'm so sorry"
1896720,1904320," it's just like it's like it's like i look at it and nothing triggers in my brain like i just like"
1904320,1911440," nothing stimulates my brain in anime whatsoever it's just like i i don't find it interesting i just don't"
1911440,1918480," i try i genuinely tried to get into that but i can't so maybe i'm done"
1921120,1929680," um so we've got some subs we've got some subs uh wow player 97 thank you so much for tier one"
1929680,1935680," with the message just saying i love your content and it keeps my mind saying uh that people cool just"
1935680,1943280," for fun and not for money uh so yeah i'm really glad that it keeps you saying it because programming by"
1943280,1950000," itself if you strip off all of this like bullshit that is going on in at the workplace programming is"
1950000,1958560," extremely fun activity it is extremely fun uh right so and it's the the industry that actually strips"
1958560,1965200," off all of the fun from it and i don't really know what to do about that it's just like yeah"
1965200,1971440," why don't you have any methods to support you"
1973600,1981280," any methods because i'm not into op i don't understand the question honestly like what methods"
1981280,1986960," is like you know in op you have objects and you have methods and why methods don't support me"
1986960,1991280," because i don't like op so that's probably why they don't want to support me they because why would"
1991280,1997840," they support somebody who hates op i don't really hate op i just like don't find it it's particularly"
1997840,2002800," useful for software development it's kind of a weird organization of your software but i mean some people"
2002800,2003120," like it"
2003120,2010080," does russian language help you to learn programming no"
2010080,2016800," like how would it help you it's just it's just a slavic language uh right so"
2016800,2023520," no it's it's as helpful for learning programming as any nature language which means"
2024480,2029440," it's actually bad for learning programming nature languages are really bad for learning programming"
2029440,2036000," because they don't match how exactly you code how exactly you tell the computer to to do the things"
2036000,2042720," right so going back to the conversation about chat gpt and using nature languages for writing programs"
2042720,2047600," right so going back to that so answer is no i don't think any nature language is going to make you"
2047600,2053200," better programmer right so i believe you need to use programming languages for programming"
2053200,2061520," um are you a hacker like other russian programmers like depends on the definition of hacker so what do"
2061520,2071280," you mean by word hacker do you mean infosec person information security specialists i don't know anything about"
2071280,2076560," information security about information security like at least i didn't explicitly study it"
2076560,2081600," like i didn't explicitly study it any information security but here is an interesting thing"
2081600,2086400," uh just because i do programming just because i build software"
2086400,2094240," i kind of implicitly know some things about information security but not too many here's the thing"
2094240,2104320," so essentially i know nothing how like i know nothing about breaking software i don't really break software"
2104320,2111680," i build software i'm really good at building software but because i build software and i'm really"
2111680,2118720," good at building software i kind of know how to break it as well even though i never explicitly studied"
2118720,2124080," breaking software you know what i mean you know what i mean right so i don't consider myself"
2124080,2130560," information security person i don't really break software but because i build software i kind of"
2130560,2137920," know how to do that so i think there was a very good video by life overflow on that specific topic"
2137920,2145280," he was actually trying to answer the question um do you need programming to be a hacker so for this"
2145280,2150640," who doesn't know life overflow is uh information security specialist from germany and he has like"
2150640,2155760," a youtube channel and stuff like that where he answers uh right so different questions and stuff"
2155760,2161440," like that he was making a video like do you need programming to become uh like an infosec person like a"
2161440,2170480," hacker and he actually uh brought up andreas cling as an example right i i think somebody"
2171360,2179840," actually submitted like uh vulnerability for serenity os right and he was able to easily reproduce that"
2179840,2186400," and after that he was able to find on him by himself more vulnerabilities even though he never"
2186400,2194240," studied information security and cracking and stuff like that like at all he's not like a hacker infosec"
2194240,2199840," person but because he uh he knows how to build software he also kind of knows how to break it"
2199840,2208080," so yeah to answer your question i do not identify myself as a hacker in a sense as the person who"
2208080,2212400," breaks software so there's other definitions of hackers but let's let's actually take the one"
2212400,2218720," that is the most popular one the person that breaks software i do not identify myself as a person who"
2218720,2224720," breaks software or who breaks breaks informational systems but because i build software i kind of"
2224720,2232560," know a thing or two but not too much you know what i mean so that's basically the answer um so any"
2232560,2239920," interest in making some internet of things project but i don't have an internet of thing i have an old"
2239920,2247280," soviet refrigerator like it doesn't even connect to the internet it barely connects to the to the wall"
2248720,2250720," so i don't know what you want from me"
2250720,2254000," all right like"
2254000,2263360," uh so they have programming book recommendations ones that either programming focused or otherwise"
2263360,2270000," i can i think one book that i could recommend uh is on algorithms and data structures it's just"
2270000,2275280," introduction to algorithm by like a clrs so that's the book that i really liked"
2276240,2281680," and that i would personally recommend right so whereas book so something like if you're into"
2281680,2287600," like algorithms and data structure i recommend this specific book it's pretty thick just like your"
2287600,2291920," bomb but if you manage to read it it's actually pretty cool you're not supposed to actually read"
2291920,2297680," it from the beginning to the end in fact it's sort of like a reference manual on different algorithms"
2297680,2303200," and data structures so you're supposed to just keep it so there's also you don't even have to buy it"
2304400,2309200," okay so they they don't allow you to download it but i mean it's kind of funny that there is like"
2309200,2321360," instantly um anyway so i think you'll find it i think you'll find it so anyway uh so yes yes so uh"
2321360,2327920," do you think a good programmer needs to know a lot of math i don't think so it depends on like what do you"
2327920,2335280," mean by math what do you mean by math just like a math is a very broad topic uh do you mean a very"
2335280,2342320," specific branch of math so the branches of math that you need to know is first of all arithmetics"
2342320,2349280," do you know how to count can you do one two three four like you if you can do that you can probably be a"
2349280,2357680," programmer all right so that's that's one of the branch of mathematics that you need to know uh right to be"
2357680,2369760," fair just by doing programming you are already implicitly without realizing learning one big branch of"
2369760,2387760," mathematics which is called uh mathematical logic so just by doing programming you're studying that"
2387760,2396800," without realizing that so for those who doesn't know mathematical logic is programming it's straight up"
2396800,2403520," programming seriously it is literally programming um it's programming that was invented by mathematicians"
2403520,2414880," before they had computers they just discovered something intrinsic about uh proofs and uh basically"
2414880,2420240," executing that proof that is basically programming and the whole process is too incomplete they actually"
2420240,2426720," realized that and they started to study that and uh then they actually demonstrated that"
2426720,2433280," mathematical logic is basically programming there's a thing called curry harvard uh correspondability uh"
2433280,2443840," so something like curry uh yeah curry harvard's correspondence so this thing so in a programming"
2443840,2450400," language theory proof theory this thing uh shows the equivalence between proofs and programs"
2450400,2456480," right so after we invented computers and after we studied computer science"
2456640,2462480," uh we realized um we realized um we realized that whatever um you know logicians mathematical logicians"
2462480,2469680," we're doing is programming so just by doing programming you're already studying mathematical logic"
2469680,2474000," basically a program is a proof of some theory"
2474000,2486560," uh is c good for doing software that needs a lot of network but not a lot of computing like irc or http server"
2486560,2492800," uh"
2492800,2496160," i don't freaking know mate so i don't freaking know"
2496160,2514480," i don't really know it's like is it is it"
2516480,2527280," no no no no that could be it no probably not that that don't even bother don't even bother with that don't even"
2527280,2529120," bother with that don't even bother uh so"
2534960,2540320," how many languages do you know how many languages do you speak uh natural languages russian and english"
2540320,2543840," right and i can understand ukrainian"
2543840,2550560," ever since i've started uh getting into serving my understanding ukrainian got boosted as"
2550560,2557360," fuck yeah actually like the more slavic languages you uh you learn the more other slavic languages you"
2557360,2561680," start to understand uh understand automatically right just because i understand ukrainian i"
2561680,2568480," way better understand like belorussian and suddenly polish right so the polish started to make even more"
2568480,2571520," more sense all of a sudden it's just like what the fuck it's pretty cool"
2571520,2578640," right what's your favorite video games let me think i think binding of isaac"
2578640,2583040," uh right it's one of my favorite games so i really like"
2583760,2589920," the dark patterns they use in the game that makes you hooked uh being hooked up um"
2589920,2596720," my brain really enjoys that so sometimes it even feels like like gambling"
2596720,2599920," it like binding of isaac is such a weird game by the way"
2599920,2606560," like you play it and basically feels like gambling right and you think like there's no"
2606560,2612720," skill involved in here you either like uh get lucky and get like a lot of cool items and a lot of cool"
2612720,2619760," synergies and you win but then you see all of these uh youtubers who's playing binding of isaacs and"
2619760,2625760," they're having this like sort of tricks on the hardest mode possible and somehow they like never"
2625760,2632320," die and you think like if that's gambling how this is not a skill like what exactly is the skill in"
2632320,2639520," binding of isaac can anybody tell me because it plays it feels like gambling but at the same time"
2639520,2648160," skillful people can like dodging um i don't know maybe it's kind of so it's more about about evading"
2648160,2655200," but at the end of the day it doesn't feel like being able to evade is like what makes you win the"
2655200,2659760," game it's just like whether you find a good combination of items that's what matters"
2660480,2665680," um so that's what i i don't know like i still didn't understand the game right"
2665680,2672000," uh do you have any music education i have an unfinished music education right"
2672000,2678560," so it's really unfinished one it's it's a really funny story actually um"
2678560,2686800," uh i dropped out of the music school when i got my first computer"
2690480,2697600," uh my entire career my entire career in music was fucking ruined by this goddamn computer"
2697600,2702880," i got into programming and at the end of the day it was not even worth it and i actually regret it"
2702880,2713200," i should have stayed in the musical school um so i even had a potential career ahead of me right because"
2713200,2721040," the musical school uh after you finish it they would offer you a place in uh wind orchestra"
2721040,2729440," right so in like in the local wind orchestra um which was actually doing different uh was"
2729440,2735120," participated in different activities and different like celebrations and stuff like that and i googled them"
2735120,2741760," up to this day they still exist and they're doing really well they're actually pretty active they're"
2741760,2748960," like you know visited different cities and stuff like that there's still going like she went there uh so"
2750800,2759120," nobody invented artificial intelligence to replace them in fact if there was something to replace"
2759120,2766400," musicians like a real musician that would have happened uh right because people invented uh you know"
2766400,2775360," vinyl players by vinyl by vinyl players you know so that supposed to replace musicians but it didn't"
2776080,2781600," so i should have become a musician you should have become a musician could you tell in which it sphere do"
2781600,2794880," you work that's the neat part i don't i don't work i'm unemployed so for everyone who's about to ask career"
2794880,2805440," questions i'm unemployed you are literally asking career advice from unemployed person just let that sink in"
2806080,2815200," okay why are you doing that do you want to become like me how to start write code in c you just"
2815200,2828240," start writing code in c okay so let me let me show you let me show you how to start writing in c uh hello"
2828240,2838080," world in c just google that so better maybe use google not duck the go google is a little bit better for"
2838080,2847680," programming so see hello world okay uh so program to display so this is the program uh you need to save"
2847680,2855760," that to a text file you need to save that to a text file so let me actually create something like hello"
2857040,2867680," right so and let's create main dot c we copy paste the the this thing here so what's next uh they don't"
2867680,2880480," really tell you dude holy this is literally generated by chat gpt i mean you can see it's like a signature"
2880480,2888320," translation of code so i don't know why there's something to chat gpt but you can instantly recognize"
2888320,2896960," this text you can instantly recognize that it has sort of like this like a structure to it like a very"
2896960,2902080," specific structure but you can kind of see that it's your chat gpt i didn't even have to read that but it's"
2902640,2910160," yeah by the way can i can i can i rant about it how about the feature that explains the code"
2910160,2919680," right have you noticed that how it doesn't explain the code it simply translates the code to natural"
2919680,2928720," language it doesn't reduce complexity of the code it simply just describes like the code as it is without"
2928720,2933360," really explaining it it's not explaining it just like you know translate it to natural language"
2933360,2938720," it doesn't reduce complexity whatsoever have you noticed that it's just like how is that a useful"
2938720,2948080," feature i don't understand so it's just like yeah have you used the 4.0 dude i didn't have an access to"
2948080,2955280," chat gpt 3.5 what are you talking about anyway so you save hello world right you don't even have to"
2955280,2962400," understand it you say hello world to um to a file and then what you have to do you have to install some"
2962400,2972240," sort of a compiler in c it's usually gcc uh right so and what you do you just call gcc main.c and you get"
2972800,2980560," an executable file so by default it's called a.out but you can give it any name uh any name through a"
2980560,2987360," flag called uh dash o right and that's going to be the executable and there you go you've got an actual"
2987360,2996320," executable uh right that you can just go ahead and run and it will uh you know say hello world that's how"
2996320,3003280," you start programming and see that's everything there is to it there's everything there is to it"
3003280,3011360," there is a text file you write your program in that text file you give that text file to the compiler"
3011360,3019120," and it generates an executable a sequence of instructions packed in a special format that your operating system"
3019120,3027040," can execute so it's almost like chat gpt you can think about this text file as a prompt and the compiler"
3027040,3035680," is a large language model right you give that prompt to the compiler and compiler generates a sequence of"
3035680,3042480," native instruct it's just like chat gpt so that's how it works that's how you start programming and see"
3042480,3051440," congratulations right so uh so you you may notice very interesting things in here right so um you run"
3051440,3058560," when you run a program it says hello world right it says hello world then if you open a file you don't"
3058560,3064400," have to understand what the is written in this file but you may notice that there is literally the same"
3064400,3071680," hello world within that text right so literally the same you can even compare them like you can"
3071680,3078720," literally see that they are the same this is the same you may suddenly all of a sudden come up with"
3078720,3086480," a hypothesis wait a second maybe that's what prints that combination of characters which means that what"
3086480,3092000," if i modify that specific region of the source code i don't understand what the is that i don't understand"
3092000,3096160," what the fuck is that but i've noticed that these two things are like literally the same holy"
3096160,3103760," fucking shit so let's uh test a hypothesis what if i replace this thing with your mom and compile this"
3103760,3111840," thing yet again would it print instead of hello world your mom so let's actually see it printed so holy"
3111840,3118240," shit so that means by doing things like that i can print on the on the screen what if i actually repeat"
3118240,3125840," this thing several times and run it again holy shit it repeated as many times as i put it in here"
3125840,3131120," you see i don't understand i don't understand in here i'm just experimenting and i"
3131120,3132480," already program and see"
3132480,3141680," so that's how you learn things that's how you learn things you just observe and you around"
3142400,3152000," you around until you find out that's how you do that it's literally in front of you you have all of"
3152000,3156960," the information to around just around that's how we do it"
3156960,3168240," next question i do things like that really with libraries part by part and see what they do exactly even"
3168240,3175840," further a lot of libraries are open source you can even read them like um i know it feels a little bit"
3175840,3185120," intimidating right to read the libraries and stuff like that but you can just read the implementations"
3185120,3192240," of the functions that you use you don't have to open library and start reading from the beginning to the"
3192240,3198960," end and not knowing where to start right so you can you may use like a very simple example and then you"
3198960,3204240," can see the function that you call the most like the function that you call the most and you can just"
3204240,3212400," pick you can just peek into the implementation and uh see what's there just to satisfy your curiosity"
3212960,3219760," and uh yeah so it's actually very educational you can not only around but you can actually look inside"
3219760,3228720," of it so yeah so this is something that i do uh with the ray leap for instance this is something"
3228720,3233840," that they do with the radio because really it is actually very easy to read uh right so i can just"
3233840,3242240," peek into the into the function have you ever used the yokto or some other linux build system no i have no"
3242240,3248960," idea what is yokto i'm sorry let me actually check it out i hope it's not porn so i'm not gonna actually"
3248960,3256880," google it up off screen so imagine okay so it's not porn all right that's already good"
3256880,3261920," so"
3261920,3266640," i've see it for the first time sorry"
3269120,3276800," okay okay okay yokta project uh is not an embedded linux distribution it creates a custom one for you"
3276800,3291840," right meta xy linux microsoft open embedded whole aws holy i don't know what it is i'm sorry"
3294560,3301360," i have no idea what the fuck it is my default what is your working environment like which distro it's"
3301360,3308080," debian i can show you if you're interested i don't know it's just need to upgrade actually"
3318560,3325200," that's the setup of a chat developer 26 yeah it's it's laptop by the way"
3325200,3334240," yes this is the laptop on which i created the legendary port"
3340480,3346080," is this is a thinkpad it's a lenovo b69 something something i don't know what the"
3346080,3349280," fuck it is it's just like something that i bought more than 10 years ago actually"
3350560,3359120," uh so laptops and netbooks b series it's for 4chan users"
3359120,3366320," change to russia let's proceed with the united states of america"
3366320,3376240," the corner of freedom hell yeah okay cool where is the where is the freedom laptop i didn't see it but"
3376240,3390240," it's yeah whatever okay why don't you use nyx os anymore because i got tired of this ideological bush"
3390240,3404000," that's why essentially nyx os uh requires you to do everything in a very anal way"
3405360,3412240," right and i got really burned when i was trying to do commercial work on nyx os"
3412240,3418640," because in the commercial work i had to do with a lot of unconventional software that i need to install"
3418640,3427680," and hack very quickly in a very dirty way and any quick dirty hacks are almost impossible in nyx os"
3427680,3434640," at least they are extremely painful and it creates a lot of friction so i said that"
3434640,3442080," just give me a linux distribution that where i can do whatever the i want so the main point of nyx os is"
3442080,3451600," so-called reproducibility and i just realized that in 99.999999999% of the cases i literally don't give a"
3451600,3457920," shit about reproducibility i just need to get this done and that doesn't include reproducing the same"
3457920,3463760," shit over and over again i just need to quickly hack something and you just need to quickly get something"
3463760,3470160," done and nyx os is really bad for that i'm really sorry to tell you it is really bad for that something"
3470160,3476240," like debian is way better for that because i can quickly hack something so you may say that using debian"
3476240,3486400," stable is actually very painful because its repos has old software but nothing stops me in debian to just"
3486400,3491440," download the source code of a fresher software and just build it and just install it something like"
3491440,3497280," that in nyx os it's just like it's painful you have to use this nyx something like don't give a"
3497280,3501440," fun just give me the software you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about i kind"
3501440,3509200," of grew out of this ideological face of this ideological purism a long time ago so i don't care anymore i'm"
3509200,3516320," sorry sorry just use windows yeah i think i should switch to windows i think i should switch to windows"
3521200,3537120," how to write hello world without stdio let's actually try to do that it's a good question"
3551200,3581120," dumb name and if you say that oh you actually cheated you actually"
3581120,3585120," cheated do that without uni std i cheated with your mom"
3585120,3589920," all right"
3589920,3595440," are you in real programmer if you don't write sys calls by hand"
3595440,3601520," i mean that's literally sys call isn't it right so i'm just like using sys calls"
3601520,3611040," how you how you to became fluent in english you just speak in english right you just"
3611040,3617920," force yourself to speak english as much as possible and that's how you become super fluent"
3617920,3626000," any plans on making a video for the main sodium channel right so i set up myself like sort of like"
3626000,3633120," a high quality bar for the main channel where i have to like edit and everything and i just like"
3633120,3638000," i couldn't bring myself to do that anymore so but maybe maybe in the future"
3638000,3645920," uh so yeah maybe we should make a small break uh maybe we should make a small break because i'm kind of"
3645920,3653680," falling asleep uh so i need to make a cup of tea so let's make this one break let's make a small break"
3653680,3664720," um yo sup i'm back so we're gonna be steeping some tea for four minutes my usual steeping time"
3666000,3678480," uh if you were to write a 2d game would you use game engine like godot or use a framework like ray leap"
3678480,3687680," and make a custom engine uh in cc plus plus i think i'm gonna go with uh ray leap all right so"
3688480,3696480," and if at some point of development i'll need to uh need something more complicated that really provides"
3696480,3702880," i would actually extend ray leap ray leap is actually very small and simple that you can"
3702880,3710080," just modify it right so uh i would use ray leap as a starting point for me for making my custom engine"
3710080,3718240," so to speak right ray leap is simple enough that i can eventually turn it into like a whole engine"
3718240,3722880," right so sort of like a template if that makes any sense"
3722880,3730240," uh how to learn function programming language if you worked only with procedural ones"
3731600,3737520," uh yeah i didn't really know i don't remember how i learned haskell to be fair"
3737520,3748080," right i just the same way as you learn imperative one you around so the you remember how i showed how to"
3748080,3757440," learn c you learn haskell the same way you literally learn haskell the same way okay hello world in haskell"
3759600,3765520," you get the point you get the point you get the point right so yeah"
3765520,3771760," just just around until we find out it's like literally the same thing"
3771760,3779920," what do you think about the absolute state of gui especially because platform are we doomed to use"
3779920,3785280," bloated electron apps we don't have to okay so let me show you"
3788240,3794080," so do you know mutualizing do you know mutualizing uh so let me actually fetch the latest changes"
3794080,3800720," because i think in the latest changes we have something cool uh yes yes yes so i'm gonna try to"
3800720,3809120," rebuild this entire thing uh okay so let me actually start uh i'm gonna do"
3811120,3817600," uh how do you start the file manager i forgot how to start file managers so all right and then we can"
3817600,3826800," just start build and usualizer as well uh yeah new buffer so okay so you're supposed to drop some"
3826800,3834000," music in here let's find some music we have some uh vip works in here"
3835040,3841600," uh all right uh all right so this is ui without any electron"
3841600,3850880," whatsoever so we can even give it more music i think um so i think like more of different stuff"
3850880,3858640," would be actually very beneficial so we can have uh more things because uh then we're gonna have uh we're"
3858640,3866240," gonna have scroll yeah there we go so and it's it's even scrollable you can even scroll this and i"
3866240,3871120," think you can switch between things and all that without electron and it's like actually look how"
3871120,3877920," quickly it uh like resizes and stuff like that and i did all of that from scratch and see it was actually"
3877920,3884080," super easy so and there is even a stream where i did all of that so you don't have to do that you"
3884080,3891680," don't have to use electron if you don't want to uh so essentially what you need is an ability to put"
3891680,3897920," shapes on the screen if you are capable of pulling shapes on the screen you you can make ui out of that"
3897920,3905360," you just should you should be just not afraid so the only reason why people don't do the way i do it is"
3905360,3913440," because they are afraid right i think you should not be afraid so that's that's basically my my idea so"
3914080,3920720," uh we're not really doomed we're not really stuck we just should stop being afraid right so"
3920720,3931120," somehow people were making sophisticated um ui without any frameworks people used to write ui"
3931120,3939600," programs straight up in win api how were they doing that without any frameworks but they were doing that"
3942800,3950400," right so it still works the same api that you used to do used to use still works why don't we use that"
3950400,3955760," today and why do we complain oh how are we gonna do like a cross well i mean cross-platform api but i"
3955760,3962240," mean so the only thing you need is just the shapes right you just need shapes so you can quite easily"
3962240,3968080," write a simple like abstraction layer on top of win api that will translate to something else on on linux"
3970960,3979280," so like at which point we became so whiny in complaining about boo hoo making hard to you"
3979280,3988480," just fucking write ui get fucking damn it stop crying that's how you solve the problem all right"
3999280,4006720," so what is your current opinion on the programming language lisp uh so my opinion on which one"
4006720,4014640," there is no such programming language as lisp i'm sorry to tell you that it doesn't exist"
4014640,4019840," it doesn't exist for more than uh half of a century it's just like another thing"
4021120,4029200," it's a family of programming languages quite diverse programming languages uh scheme is quite different"
4029200,4036640," from common lisp and it is quite different from closure what's up what's up what's up hello hello so uh"
4036640,4046080," what's my opinion on the whole family of these languages uh the only thing that unites the family of these"
4046080,4053520," languages is is the syntax so that means the question boils down to what i think about uh lisp syntax"
4053520,4059920," but there's more to these different lisp than syntax they actually can have a kind of interesting"
4059920,4064720," semantics and stuff like that so your question boils down what i think about s expressions"
4066160,4076400," uh they're okay i guess that's one way to represent the ast i guess so that's basically so"
4076400,4087280," your opinion on parenthesis well i mean um here's the thing there is a classical example right so"
4088960,4098560," this is how you call function in c this is how you call functions and this how you call functions in lisp"
4098560,4104320," same amount of parenthesis"
4104320,4112720," it's it's literally the same amount of princess well what what are you talking about"
4113840,4120800," it's it's it's it's the same so it is as as match as in c so i don't know why people"
4120800,4126960," constantly complain of too many parentheses i don't understand where do they see too many"
4126960,4130560," parentheses it's literally the same amount of parentheses i just proved it to you"
4130560,4140560," so i don't know so my opinion is it's one way to represent ast i guess so that's that's my opinion"
4141600,4144880," if you want to talk about specific lisps right we can talk about that"
4144880,4153200," it's a things like common lisp scheme closure racket racket racket is actually a pretty cool lisp i"
4153200,4156960," think it's uh it's based on uh on the skin right"
4156960,4166400," god yeah and see you can even do this kind of stuff uh yeah this one i really like this is one of my"
4166400,4169120," favorite uh lisps right racket"
4169120,4174320," pretty cool video coming to check it out"
4174320,4181920," golang yay yeah golang is my favorite lisp hell yeah hey hey brother"
4181920,4188800," uh worst lisp is elisp i i do agree with that as an emaxer i do agree with that"
4191600,4197520," um so what kind of tea do i drink i drink some sort of um green tea"
4197520,4204480," i think it's just a green tea loosely green tea uh we had to use racket in college for functional"
4204480,4210640," programming that was cool it is in fact cool so it also has some sort of id called doctor racket"
4210640,4213520," oh i even have it look at that i have a dr racket"
4213520,4227120," dr racket it takes so much time to load it up it why why did it take so much time"
4230480,4239280," um it's loading icons look at that like what i like about dr racket it takes so much time to load up"
4239280,4246560," and this is what you're greeted with like excuse me what exactly where you're loading up"
4248400,4264880," like what why um one two three four so okay can i increase i can increase the phone i can increase"
4264880,4275120," no language chosen memory limit 128 megabytes 120 megabytes is enough for anybody it is enough for"
4275120,4285520," anybody dr racket cannot process program until you choose a program uh we've been waiting a minute for"
4285520,4292800," that for 128 megabytes and not being able to use this thing until we choose a language"
4292800,4303360," yes that's what we were loading up uh so can i increase a font it's kind of interesting i'm focused"
4303360,4309040," at the top and i'm trying to increase the font but it increasing the font at the bottom thing"
4309040,4312000," it's a marvelous programming language"
4312000,4331520," ah anyway so oh it's actually okay it also increases it okay so lang racket so can i can can i do that now"
4332320,4339040," so i think i have to reload this entire thing yeah i have to reload it warning the definition window has"
4339040,4350720," changed click run uh okay oh yeah here is the run yo mother bugger you can i what's the key to to do run"
4351600,4362000," uh yeah okay so uh plus one two what is it it is lagging like a motherfucker"
4362000,4370240," it was lagging to highlight the numbers in here"
4372480,4376560," for fuck's sake and it was advertising this language"
4376560,4380560," holy"
4380560,4384640," oh"
4384640,4391280," 120 megabytes is not enough yeah it is not"
4393040,4398640," uh would you consider writing a programming language for music creation like sonic pie super"
4398640,4407520," collider uh maybe i was thinking to implement like a simple synthesizer but i need a midi keyboard"
4407520,4418480," uh so can you please tell jblow he should release jai open beta like he wouldn't listen to me i don't think so"
4422640,4428560," i honestly think that john blow should not release jai at its current state because"
4428560,4432960," all of the junior developers"
4432960,4440800," are gonna cry all over the hacker news and all of the reddit how jai is bad"
4440800,4452320," and readable and safe and maintainable and so on and so forth and because 99 of uh software developers these"
4452320,4455920," days is juniors is juniors it's pretty much everyone is going to be crying about that"
4455920,4464320," and this language is not designed for inexperienced developers this language is designed for experienced"
4464320,4469840," developers so yeah i don't think it's a good idea to actually read it at this point"
4469840,4476560," people just won't understand but they are going to anyway probably and he's kind of losing experience"
4476560,4482160," defs to zeke right now dude all of the experience deaf already in better"
4482160,4491920," uh all the experience they've already in better my friend i'm really sorry to tell you that"
4497200,4507440," oh you are not in better well i'm i have bad news for you"
4507440,4520560," did you always work with linux and vim terminal no not really uh i first actually my first operating"
4520560,4532480," system was windows xp right so my first operating system was that my first ide was delphi 7."
4532480,4537200," people just don't realize how old i am right"
4537200,4542960," it's kind of funny how people see me for the first time and they assume that i"
4542960,4549040," started to program like yesterday right um i've been programming for 18 years"
4549040,4557440," i went through like different uh not windows 95 or unfortunately yeah so i'm not that old"
4557440,4563760," right i'm not in the level of people who started at dos i wish i was but i'm not so"
4568000,4574080," what project makes you feel prouder port or olive sea neither i don't know"
4574080,4578160," uh so if i have to choose between these two"
4578160,4585440," actually olive sea right so if i have to pick between like port and olive lfc it's olive sea"
4585440,4597520," because in olive sea uh i realized my old dream and my old dream was uh let me actually show you"
4598000,4607280," uh to be able to do that pixel by pixel without opengl"
4607280,4616080," and i wanted to be able to do this kind of stuff i think since i started to do programming like i wanted"
4616080,4625040," to understand 3d graphics at a very deep level at a very very deep level and i finally did it i finally"
4625040,4631600," understand uh 3d graphics on a deep enough level not too deep but deep enough to actually be able to"
4631600,4637840," render this kind of stuff without opengl pixel by pixel this is not open jail like i'm literally"
4637840,4646800," rendering all that pixel by pixel so and that is something i'm super proud i'm more proud of that"
4646800,4655600," then i'm proud of port seriously i know people find making your own programming language more impressive"
4655600,4660720," than this but because i know how programming languages are made programming languages are not"
4660720,4668160," a mystery boxes for me fortunately or unfortunately right so i completely demystified programming languages"
4668160,4675680," for myself long time ago so i didn't find them interesting anymore uh right but this thing was a"
4675680,4683600," mystery for me at the time and that is something i'm super proud of too yeah i'm more proud of uh olivets"
