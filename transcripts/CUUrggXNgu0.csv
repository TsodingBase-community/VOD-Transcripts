960,7680," Hello everyone and welcome to another Zozin session. Let's do this 17th day of"
7680,15180," Advent of Code in the God's Temple. Trick shot! You finally decode the elves"
15180,20220," message ""Hi"", the message says. You continue searching for these slay keys."
20220,26640," Ahead of you is what appears to be a large ocean trench."
26640,31500," Okay, I see. Could the keys have fallen into it? You'd better send a probe to"
31500,36420," investigate. The probe launcher on your submarine can fire the probe with any"
36420,43860," integer velocity in the x forward and y upward or downward if negative direction."
43860,50940," For example, an initial xy velocity like 0 10 would fire the probe straight up,"
50940,56220," while an initial velocity like 10 minus 1 would fire the probe downwards at a"
56220,62040," slight downward angle. The probe's xy position starts at 0 0, then it will"
62040,67980," follow some trajectory by moving in steps. On each steps these changes occur in the"
67980,72120," following order. The probe's x position increased by x velocity, the probe's y"
72120,79020," position is increased by y velocity. Due to the drag, the probe's x velocity"
79020,86080," changes by 1 towards the value 0. That is, it decreases by 1 if it is greater than 0, increases"
86080,90780," by 1 if it's less than 0, or does not change if it's already 0."
90780,95640," 0. Okay, so we'll figure out what that means a little bit later when we're going to start"
95640,100600," implementing this. Due to the gravity, the probe's y velocity decreases by 1. Okay, so this is"
100600,105280," something that I implement every time I make a simple platformer game, right, with the basics,"
105280,109480," physics and stuff like that, should be pretty straightforward. So though I usually do that in"
109480,114540," floats, so here everything seems to be in integers, which is a little bit easier, right, because there's no floating"
114540,120060," point shenanigans going on, which is nice. For the probe to successfully make it into the trench,"
120060,128380," the probe must be on some trajectory that causes it to be within the target area after any step."
128380,132860," The submarine computer has already calculated this target area your puzzle input. For example,"
132860,141420," target area x2030 and this one, this target area means that you need to find initial xy velocity"
141420,148620," value such that after any step, the probe's x position is at least 20 and at most 30 and the"
148620,155580," probe's y position is at least minus blah blah blah. Given this trajectory, area one initial velocity that"
155580,164940," causes the probe to be within the target area is 7 to 20, almost at 20. In this diagram, s is the probe's"
164940,172140," initial position zero is the x coordinate increases to the right blah blah blah. Okay, so another initial"
172140,177420," velocity blah blah blah. Another blah blah blah. The initial trajectory that doesn't cause the"
177420,185180," probe to be within the target area after any step is 7. Okay, so it can tunnel. So it is allowed to"
185180,193980," tunnel through the area. That's very interesting. So it literally teleports. Cool. Thank you. Thank you"
193980,198780," that you don't force us to actually like take the tunneling into account, which is nice. The probe"
198780,204860," appears to pass through the target area, but it never within it after any step. Instead, it continues down"
204860,212540," to the right. Only the first few steps are shown. If you're going to fire a highly scientific prop out of a"
212540,218700," super cool probe launcher, you might as well do it with style. How high can you make the probe go"
218700,226220," while still reaching the target area? The above example using an initial velocity of 69 is the best"
226220,233100," you can do, causing the probe to reach the maximum y position of 45. Any higher initial y velocity causes"
233100,239020," the probe to overshoot the target area entirely. Find the initial velocity that causes the probe to reach"
239020,245740," the highest y position and still eventually be within the target area after any step. What is the highest"
245740,251980," y position it reaches on this trajectory? Okay, so and that leaves the question. What's going to be the"
251980,258540," what's going to be the part two? Is the part two gonna force us to take into account the tunneling?"
258540,265580," Because I hate dealing with tunneling. So I never know. Oh, you have to parse this shit. Thank you."
265580,273820," Though, I'm not even sure if I want to parse this entire thing. All right. So I can just like encode it"
273820,281180," straight into my into my code. So maybe no parsing is required for this particular situation. Right. So"
281820,289420," all right, let me go ahead and create a new day. Um, so new day is going to be 17. All right."
289420,296060," Uh, I have to provide the AOC first. Um, just a second. I probably need to sneeze."
296060,302140," Um, gebrated. Excuse me. Um, so let's continue."
302140,310940," Um, all right. So I'm gonna actually quit this one and quit this one and run AOC virtual machine."
311820,316300," All right."
316300,325580," Should have actually added the, uh, the sample so I can copy paste them within the temple."
325580,334380," All right. I think that was very dumb. Okay, let's go back. Uh, so I'm gonna mount the AOC 2021"
334380,341740," one more time. Uh, right. And I'm gonna go there, uh, with Emacs. So it's a little bit easier for me to"
341740,349900," navigate and do things, right? So sample TXT. Okay. So this is going to be our sample."
349900,356700," All right. And I'm going to put a new line just in case and input TXT, uh, like this."
356700,362460," So the actual puzzle input is going to be this thing. I don't think it makes any sense to even"
362460,366620," try to parse that if we can just like put that into the code. And that's why I need to have it here."
367500,372940," Uh, so it's easier for me to copy paste, um, within the templates. Okay."
372940,385100," All right. 17. And here is my sample, which I'm going to copy paste and, uh, put it in here."
385100,389900," Right. So here is the sample. I'm going to put it in the comment for now, at least."
390700,401340," Uh, so let me see target area X, uh, and Y. So I'm wondering, do we want to have like some sort of a"
401340,408460," structure for points? Maybe not for now. We'll see. Um, so I'm going to just define something like,"
409740,421420," Uh, you need X is going to be 20, uh, and in it Y is going to be minus 10. Then in it X is good. Actually."
425500,435260," So maybe I'm going to call it to mean, right. And X, this is going to be max X is equal 30 and"
435260,447180," max Y is going to be minus five. Okay. That is very cool. That is very cool. So, and what we want"
447180,452380," to do essentially is to simulate the entire process, right? To simulate the entire process. It would be"
452380,460140," kind of nice to just have a function, right? Uh, simulate, which actually accepts initial"
460140,467900," velocity, right? So let's call it V X, uh, and, uh, V Y. And maybe also initial position though,"
467900,473180," initial position is known to be like zero zero. So it doesn't matter. And that entire thing will"
473180,480620," actually return a true or false indicating, uh, whether it's, you know, hit the area or not. And"
480620,487260," maybe it will also return the maximum, uh, maximum height, right? So let's actually do something like"
487260,497820," max, uh, height, uh, there we go. Uh, return false. So, and essentially we can try to brute force this"
497820,503420," entire thing, right? We can try different, um, you know, different initial velocities and stuff like"
503420,508780," that, uh, until we find something, something that actually fits there though. We need to define the"
508780,514860," boundaries of the, of the simulation at some point, right? So it's going to be rather interesting."
514860,522380," Uh, all right. So I'm going to start with, uh, X equals zero and, uh, 64 is, uh, Y equals zero."
522380,529180," Right. So, and until some sort of a condition, I don't really know when we're going to stop."
529900,540300," Right. Um, though we can at least have something like, uh, in, in target, right? So where are we going"
540300,550300," to accept X and Y, uh, I 64, 64 Y. And in here, we're going to just check whether this entire thing is"
550300,557580," within the target, right? So min, uh, min X, now what I'm going to actually go to call it minx"
557580,564140," because I don't want to type additional underscore because it forces me to press, press shift and"
564140,568780," pressing shift like causes all sorts of weird behavior within templeOS. So it's better not to actually"
568780,577020," touch that. So I suppose this is how we're going to actually check for that, uh, max X, uh, and min Y"
577900,588140," less than that's max Y maxi. Right. So I think this is basically it. Right. And while we are not"
588140,594060," in targets, right, while we are not in target, we're going to be just simulating this entire thing."
594060,600540," Uh, and, uh, we're going to just like code the rules that are here. Right. So props position increases"
600540,605100," by X velocity, right. Incrementing by the X velocity. Cool."
605900,615580," Y is incremented by the Y velocity. Uh, and, uh, due to the drag props, X velocity changes by one towards"
615580,623020," the value zero. Uh, huh. Okay. That's very interesting. So that means if it's positive,"
623020,630060," it needs to be negative, right? If it's negative, it has to be positive. Uh, that is it increases"
630060,636140," by one if it's greater than zero, uh, decreases. Okay. So we can try to do something like this."
636140,646540," We can take a sign of X, right. And, um, sign returns minus one or one. And basically we can negate it."
646540,655660," Uh, right. Um, due to the drag, the props, X velocity changes by one. So velocity X velocity."
655660,662220," So that means it has to be VX, I suppose. Right. It has to be VX. And, uh, then we're going to just"
662220,667980," edit. Right. So sign is supposed to return minus one or one or zero, depending on the, uh, on the sign"
667980,674300," of this entire thing. Okay. And due to the gravity, the props Y velocity decreases by one. Okay. So that is"
674300,680060," also understandable. Uh, and we're going to just like decrease it by one, maybe plus minus one, right?"
680060,688620," Because I want to have plus equals for all of these things, right? There we go. Uh, so, and max height,"
688620,696460," essentially it's the maximum Y, right? It's the maximum Y. And I suppose one of the things we can do"
696460,703500," in here, um, is, you know, I want to rename this thing. It's too long to type, uh, generally the temple"
703500,708540," OS text editor is so bad that you want to come up with smallest name possible. So you don't have to type too much."
708540,715100," It is very important. Uh, so since it's maximum, we want to assign I 64, uh, minimum, right? We're"
715100,721100," assigning a minimum and here, uh, I don't even know how we're going to do that. Um, so"
721100,731980," uh, to, to, to, to, I suppose we can just put it somewhere here. Right. Uh, and it's going to be max H,"
731980,743340," uh, maximum, uh, maximum I 64 between max H and the current Y, right? So, and in here it will return"
743340,748940," true essentially. So, but this is like only one condition, right? So this is basically only one"
748940,755420," condition. The second condition is when we actually overshoot, we need to detect when, uh,"
756940,767020," we completely overshoot the area, right? When we completely overshoot the area. So let me take a"
767020,777580," look at the input actually. So cool thing here is that X, uh, the area in X is located, uh, to the right,"
777580,783580," right? It is located to the right, uh, in case of the input, in case of the input, it's also located to"
783580,793100," the right. So one of the conditions is, uh, we can use is essentially the current X is smaller or equal"
793100,800780," to the maximum X, right? So we're going to basically assume that we're moving like towards the area."
800780,806620," And if at any point X becomes bigger than the maximum X of the area, it, there's no point in"
806620,813580," continuing doing this entire thing. So yeah, it's like, yeah, we better stop. So, and the actual"
813580,821020," result here is going to be in target, right? If in target, um, that means, uh, simulation went successful"
821020,828620," and we found the thing that actually produces what we want. And, uh, then, um, and then we have a max"
828620,833260," height. So that's pretty much it, right? That's pretty much it. So I also want to take a look at the"
833260,839900," input. All right. I'm going to copy paste it into my, uh, into my file somewhere here."
839900,842300," So this is going to be the comment."
842300,847900," All right. So let me try to compile this into, I think, and see if it compiles. Okay. First try"
847900,856140," compiled it first try. Uh, so let me now see, let me now see if we can simulate at least the sample."
856780,865660," Uh, right. So I'm going to do simulate, um, and the velocity at which the velocity at which it hits,"
865660,873580," uh, the, um, the thing. Given this target area, one initial velocity that causes the prop to be"
873580,880380," within the target area is seven and two. Okay. So if we put seven and two, uh, so I also have to provide the"
880380,887740," max H right. Uh, I 64, max H I probably don't need to initialize it because it's initialized within the"
887740,895180," process itself. And, uh, in here, uh, we can do something like this. If it was successful, we're"
895180,907100," going to print, uh, success, um, max height, uh, is this one. So it's going to be max H, uh, and in here,"
907100,913340," we're going to do something like failure, uh, right. And let's actually see what's going to happen."
913340,918860," So success, the max height was three, which is rather interesting. Is it, was it actually three?"
918860,925180," Uh, one, it was actually three. If this is the zero, one, two, three, it was in fact three. So I think we"
925180,932860," simulated that successfully. Uh, so we can, um, try six, three, uh, now. Right. So it's the same area."
933980,945100," Uh, okay. Okay. So this is going to be six, three, pretty straightforward, six, three, and the max height"
945100,956140," was six, one, two, three, one, two, three. In fact, it is six. And for the nine, uh, nine, zero, uh,"
956140,962860," the height was zero basically because it actually went like down. Uh, okay. And let's actually take a look"
962860,971820," at this one that doesn't actually hit anything. 17 minus four, right? 17, uh, minus four. Right."
971820,976220," And it said failure and for the failure, I forgot to provide the new line. Right. So let's actually"
976220,982780," put it in here and it is in fact a failure. So that is very, very cool. So we can basically have, uh,"
982780,991180," initial velocity and we can very quickly check, um, very quickly check, uh, whether it's success or not."
991180,996220," So the thing now we can try to understand how we can brute force this entire process."
996220,999420," I hope you can just do brute force should be pretty straightforward. Right."
1000700,1010620," Um, so let me, let me think. Um, I also kind of want to visualize this entire thing, but I'm not sure"
1010620,1018940," if it, uh, if I'll spend like enough time doing so. So let me, let me think. So maybe I want to draw some"
1018940,1027980," some stuff. Um, to, to, to, to, to, to simulating all of this stuff. Um, what I'm thinking is that"
1027980,1032540," it probably doesn't make sense to, you know,"
1035820,1047340," let me, let me see, uh, so there's some sort of like area of values where it doesn't make sense to"
1047340,1055340," even go there. Right. So if we have something like this, right, if we have something like this,"
1055340,1065740," uh, to, to, to, to, um, so this is the zero, right? This is the zero. Uh, and"
1066700,1080540," now can we somehow identify like a minimum and maximum of X, right? So again, first of all,"
1080540,1086380," you cannot do minus X. It's, there is no point in throwing this entire thing in the opposite direction"
1086380,1092060," whatsoever. Right. So all of the Xs are going to be, uh, greater than zero, right? So they're going to go"
1092060,1100940," up until there, uh, though there is another limitation in here. Uh, so this thing should"
1100940,1109260," not be bigger than max X, right? Because if you try to do max X, uh, you basically will overshoot,"
1109260,1119260," right? So this is basically the range within which you can do this entire stuff. Uh, right. So then, um,"
1122060,1130620," if I just throw up, right, if I just throw, I can even say that the range here is going to be one,"
1130620,1137900," right? Because if you make X equal zero, if you make X equal zero, so you're going to only throw up,"
1137900,1145180," uh, and, uh, it's going to just bring back to, to here, right? So yeah, so it's going to be that. And"
1145180,1151020," if you're going to have like a negative Y, it's going to be just that, uh, in terms of Y, uh, Y"
1151020,1156460," can be zero though. Y can be zero. That's totally fine. So that means you're just throwing in here"
1156460,1163820," and, uh, then it will go down or not go down or whatever. Um, so yeah. So another interesting"
1163820,1171980," condition. So we may want to also check, we may also also want to check that Y, uh, Y"
1171980,1182860," Y is less or equal max Y because for the situation like that, right? For the situation like that,"
1182860,1189900," when X is very small, but Y is high, it will take a lot of time to reach the situation when"
1189900,1195420," it goes over this entire thing. So I think it's better to check, uh, both of this, uh, both of"
1195420,1201820," these things. So essentially it kind of like defines this area, right? If at any point, if at"
1201820,1207740," any point your prop goes into that area, that's it, there is no point in even trying further,"
1207740,1212380," right? You know what I'm talking about? So there's no kind of point in even going into that area."
1212380,1219820," So, and what's going to be the maximum Y that it makes sense to try? I guess you can also say"
1219820,1226220," max Y, right? It's, it's the safest bet that you can take, right? So just like iterate, uh, through"
1226220,1235580," minus one, uh, max X and from zero to max Y and, uh, like just try this entire rectangle. Um, right. And"
1235580,1245340," though in terms of, yeah, you also want to go up. Yeah. So something, something wrong with the Y, I think"
1245340,1255100," something wrong with my Y, though, since we're maximizing the height, since we're the maximizing"
1255100,1265420," the height, uh, maximizing the height, it probably makes sense to, yeah, it probably makes sense"
1266460,1274780," to not even go into negative for sure. So you can only like throw up, but how up can you throw?"
1274780,1285660," How up can you throw? I think, uh, you can throw up until you are stop succeeding or something."
1286940,1316300," So, yeah. Let me see."
1316860,1329420," Okay. So, I64, uh, VX is going to be equal to, well, we wouldn't need to initialize this until,"
1329420,1338380," I think. Um, so with Y, I'm not quite sure what's going to be with Y. So it's going to be definitely"
1338380,1344060," at least one, uh, at least one, otherwise you're not doing anything, anything significant, but for"
1344060,1351500," how long do we want to go up? For how long? Uh, so what's going to be the maximum in here?"
1353180,1358620," Right. Um, what's going to be the maximum?"
1358620,1364940," Because if you, there is some sort of a situation when it..."
1367740,1379740," Um, no, no, no. So if you pick very small Y, very small Y, it does not actually reach anything."
1379740,1386300," If you, then at some point it starts to reach something, and at some point it stops reaching"
1386300,1392540," again. So there is like this weird area where you are failing, right? Where you're failing, then you"
1393020,1398860," stop failing, and then you fail again. So what I'm thinking is that basically, can we just like"
1398860,1406940," rely on that? Right. So essentially we're going to iterate, uh, for Y, um, and we're going to just"
1406940,1413340," ignore if it's failing, right? We're going to just ignore if it's failing and then, uh, it's not failing"
1413340,1418460," and then it's failing again or something like that. Though it would be better to just like find the, um,"
1420860,1426380," the, um, the, um, the best, like the, the range, uh, find the range for this entire stuff."
1426380,1440140," So, um, though what I'm thinking is one of the things we can just try to do is for this specific square"
1442540,1449820," just simulate as big as possible, right? So just because as big as possible, maybe like, uh, 100,"
1449820,1458140," right? And just see within which area it is succeeding and within which area it is failing."
1458140,1462300," I think that we are rather interesting, right? VX, um,"
1465260,1470380," uh, so it could be probably zero, uh, VX and then"
1470380,1479740," this one cannot be zero and this one is definitely, um, this one is definitely"
1484300,1493100," going to be less than max x plus plus VX, plus plus VX, uh, right. And what I can do in here,"
1493100,1504940," can I simulate, um, this entire thing? So simulate, uh, VX, VY, VX, VY, uh, with a max height."
1505580,1511340," And what I probably want to do, like, I want to have some sort of a square that will tell me this"
1511340,1517020," entire thing. So I want to like, just, uh, put that into, into some sort of area in here."
1517020,1527020," So let's call it maybe, um, a map, right? This, this is going to be a map and in here we're going to have"
1527020,1534380," like 101, uh, all these things. And in terms of that stuff, it's going to be, so let's actually put"
1534380,1541340," 100 plus some, some sort of a thing, max x plus another sort of a thing. Uh, right. And in here,"
1541340,1545580," while I simulate and everything, I just want to see what's going to be the, like, the result of the"
1545580,1555660," simulation here. Uh, VX, VX, VY, uh, there we go. And then I just want to print this entire thing,"
1555660,1562300," if that makes any sense, right? So I just want to like, see that. Though, because of that, it probably"
1562300,1568380," doesn't make any sense to like have that as an array, right? I can just straight up, uh, render it."
1568380,1576220," Right. So I can just try to render it. So if simulation is successful, right?"
1576220,1584220," I'm going to print hash. Otherwise I'm going to printing the, like some sort of a dot, I suppose."
1584220,1591980," That makes sense. Right. So, and this is not the space, not the space, right? It's more of a, like,"
1591980,1603420," space of the velocity, sort of speak. Right. So I just want to see how it behaves. Um, all right."
1603420,1608940," So, and then here we want to provide like a, uh, a new line. So maybe I'm going to actually like 100"
1608940,1615100," in terms of Y is probably too much, but should be fine. Okay. So we've got something, uh, right. And"
1615100,1622700," in all of these cases, there are, uh, not successful, which is rather strange. None of them are successful."
1622700,1635180," So that's really, really weird. Um, okay. Uh, VX, VY. So what? That is so weird. Max X."
1635180,1644780," Because I'm pretty sure within this entire stuff, we should hit, uh, seven and two, but we never actually"
1644780,1655420," hit seven and two. That is so wild. Why? Uh, so let me, uh, yeah, you should have at least something"
1655420,1670140," successful, but it's, it's not there. What am I missing? Um, all right. Did I modify something weirdly? Uh, if"
1673260,1684620," VX is equal to seven, two, seven and VY is equal to two, you have to print something like, uh, Hey,"
1684620,1693980," right. So we are, we are hitting that thing, but this thing is telling me that no, it is not true. Um,"
1693980,1701740," VX, VY. I just tested it."
1701740,1707340," VX. So if I put seven and two in here, uh, it is never successful."
1707340,1717660," But it was successful. Wasn't it just a second ago?"
1717660,1719900," Was it not?"
1719900,1729180," Am I going crazy? Like it was just successful. Like, is that TempleOS playing tricks on me yet again?"
1729820,1739020," Uh, simulate seven to max H, right? And if it's successful, uh, I want to print, like I just did"
1739020,1743500," that and it worked and I didn't modify anything. What the hell are you talking, TempleOS?"
1743500,1751660," What the hell is going on? Why, why, why, why, why, why, why? Okay. So failure, uh, right. And if I do that,"
1752220,1759740," Uh, it, it is failure now, it worked before. What did I modify? What did I modify? I just tested everything."
1760620,1769180," Um, man. What the fuck? Seriously. Like, I'm so disappointed."
1770860,1784220," Um, what am I missing? Um, what am I missing, though? It's in target."
1784220,1795100," Did I, there is a situation when I pass by a pointer and it's not a pointer anymore or something like that."
1795100,1805100," Is that the situation yet again? Uh, so, what the fuck? This is so, so crushing. Like it worked before"
1805100,1811660," and now it just all of a sudden doesn't work because fuck you. Um, I'm okay. I didn't, I didn't even know."
1811660,1827660," Um, okay. Let me make a small break because I think I'm going crazy. Like the TempleOS is going"
1827660,1832220," to be a death of me. Seriously. Like it's just something works, something suddenly doesn't work"
1832220,1838060," and the compiler is not helping you at all. Just a second. Um, I just realized that there is something"
1838060,1845420," that I did change, uh, since the last time. So I think that's this one. Uh, okay. So this is not a"
1845420,1852460," good thing, uh, as an indicator of end of the loop. Okay. So this is not TempleOS. All right. Um, just a"
1852460,1866700," second. Um, uh, okay. So cool. So now it is not failing. It is always successful for whatever freaking"
1866700,1873420," reason, which is really weird. Um, so I wouldn't expect this entire thing to be successful at all."
1873420,1886140," Uh, but it is in fact successful. Why, why is it successful? Uh, like I would expect it to not be"
1886140,1892780," successful at some point, but it's just like, yeah, it is always successful now, even when, well, I mean,"
1892780,1900860," I can try to put like VX to zero, right? VX to zero. And there should be at least one moment when"
1900860,1908780," it's not successful, but it is suddenly successful. That means it hits the target every time, right?"
1908780,1915980," It just does hit the target every time. So I would suppose if I add like 10 to this entire thing, it is"
1915980,1923100," still always successful. Okay. So everything is wrong. Everything is completely wrong. Uh, why would"
1923100,1929660," it be like that? Why would it be? It just doesn't make any sense. Probably maybe I want to actually draw"
1929660,1935740," the entire thing, but visualizing this entire stuff is actually, it will take too much time. Uh, right."
1935740,1943340," Um, I really don't want to spend time visualizing this entire thing. It's just like coding this thing"
1943340,1948220," is going to take like an hour, maybe also fighting with TempleOS. So it's better not to even touch that."
1950380,1956780," Uh, okay. So I think I need to make a proper break and refill my cup, uh, cup of tea and, uh, maybe like"
1956780,1963900," think about this, uh, this entire thing while I'm making a cup of tea. Uh, so, um, I've got an interesting"
1963900,1970620," idea. What if that's because of some sort of like weird operator presidents when I'm using this feature of"
1970620,1977660," TempleOS. So what if I have to like rub that in parentheses because the parser cannot like"
1977660,1984300," properly understand what the fuck I mean in here. So that will be kind of disappointing. Well, it is"
1984300,1990860," not the case at least. All right. So this is not the case for sure. Uh, but it was worth the try, right?"
1990860,1999900," So it was worth the try. Um, interestingly, interestingly, so there are some situations when"
2000940,2009580," this is like negative, right? 17 minus four. Uh, interestingly, maybe that's actually true."
2009580,2016860," Maybe that's actually true. Like doesn't matter how high you send it. It will always kind of be there,"
2016860,2025660," but it doesn't make much sense. Right. What if I increase this X? No. Okay. What if, uh, I will put like"
2025660,2036140," minus five in here, uh, will it stop doing anything? So it stops at minus four, right? It stops at minus"
2036140,2042780," four. So that means somewhere here, uh, it should have a dot, but it just doesn't."
2042780,2050620," It simply doesn't. So it says all of these things are successful yet again. I probably need to go back"
2050620,2055740," to my code. All right. So I really regret that I keep removing that piece of code because apparently"
2055740,2066860," it is very useful. So, uh, all right, simulate. Uh, so what was that? 17 minus four, 17 minus four,"
2067420,2075980," uh, uh, max age. Right. And then I just want to print that entire thing, uh, max age. And, uh, otherwise"
2075980,2084380," this is the failure, right? Failure. Uh, there we go. So it is failure. And I would assume that here,"
2086140,2096140," right here we do hit 17 minus four at some point. Cut that out, cut everything out. Oh my God."
2096140,2103180," Please edit everything that out, please, please, please, please. Okay. Whatever. You didn't see"
2103180,2109820," anything like, like pretend that this never happened. Uh, okay. So, and the entire thing actually hangs,"
2109820,2118780," which is good. I think it is doing something. Right. Yikes. That's the most yikes moment I've"
2118780,2124380," ever had in my entire life anyway. Uh, so I presume that maybe it hangs on some of the,"
2124380,2133340," and some of the existing values. Right. So, uh, let me, okay. I'm going to blame the, the font of"
2133340,2138140," TempleOS for that. The font makes it kind of difficult to spot this sort of errors. All right. So,"
2138140,2143260," I'm going to blame the, the TempleOS font. Um, okay. So, the thing I want to do, I want to actually"
2143260,2149900," see at which point, uh, this entire thing will probably hang. And maybe that will give me an idea."
2149900,2155260," Uh, okay. So, it doesn't hang, uh, in these particular situations, which is probably nice, I guess."
2155260,2162380," Maybe. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. The winner gets this. So, uh, all right. Okay. Of course,"
2162380,2171580," I'm an idiot because I, all right. So, I removed it. Um, success. Right. So, and that means I need to"
2171580,2180780," take the entire thing, uh, in here. Right. Uh, success. Uh, I'm going to put it in here. If success,"
2180780,2190140," do that. Uh, right. And what I wanted is basically like this. Um, right."
2191420,2201340," Uh, and there we go. So, it didn't even print anything, which makes me, okay."
2201340,2212140," No, no, no, not that, not that. Uh, also, what if I bring back this thing?"
2212780,2220700," Why less than max wine? Uh, okay. So, it kind of stops now, but does it even print anything useful,"
2220700,2225180," uh, in terms of like, does it give us any useful information?"
2225180,2232700," Uh, okay. So, and yeah, so that was a bad idea. Well, we already, we already been there."
2235580,2242780," Uh, we already been there. Um, so this is not how it is going to work."
2242780,2245340," Though."
2249420,2257340," I think I have to do it slightly differently. And why less or equal"
2262300,2263180," max one?"
2263180,2272060," No, not really. No, no, no, no. Greater"
2272060,2279580," than mean one. Because it's the other way around, isn't it?"
2280700,2289020," Yes. I think that's the case. I think that's the case. Because x can be bigger than x and y."
2289020,2293180," Yeah. Y grows up."
2293180,2299100," Y, y grows up. That means we only want to stop."
2301580,2303500," We only want to stop when..."
2303500,2314780," Oh, this is the OpenGL coordinates that always mess up with my brain. They always mess up with my brain."
2314780,2321980," I hate them. I really, really hate them. So, one more time. Maybe I need to draw that. Because,"
2321980,2328380," uh, since I'm a programmer, I always think of y going down. And when I have to do the mathematical"
2328380,2333820," things, when y goes up, it actually messes up with all my wiring buildup over the years."
2333820,2342060," So, I just can't comprehend that. Right. So, because of this, x, y. So, this is the..."
2342060,2349020," I can't comprehend that. Like, really. So, I have to rewire everything in my brain."
2349020,2357420," So, minimum x is this one. Maximum x is this one. Right. So, minimum x is this one. But minimum y"
2357420,2361820," has to be this one. So, that means the first point actually points somewhere here. Right. So,"
2361820,2366220," oh my god. It's like, it messes up with my brain all the time. I'm really sorry. So,"
2366220,2376060," and the maximum x is like this. But the minimum, minimum y, the maximum y is like this. So, if it's"
2376060,2384140," slower than the minimum one. So, it's like flipped around and it's just like, oh my god. So, yeah. All right."
2386300,2394860," That's why I could not understand that. So, y is while y is bigger. So, it's actually"
2394860,2406220," bigger. So, it stays around like this area. But if at any point it goes smaller than this minimum,"
2406220,2411980," this minimum, that means we should stop. Okay. So, that makes a lot of sense. Finally, that makes a lot"
2411980,2424620," of sense. And what I'm thinking is that maybe we can do y. So, let me see the region in which we want"
2424620,2437340," to do y then. Right. Because that means y can go be positive. All right. And then, to be fair,"
2437340,2444140," y can also be negative. But to what extent y can be negative. Right. So, if I put something like minus"
2444140,2451980," five. Right. So, yeah. Look at that. Look at that. There is like a whole. Oh, that's a very interesting"
2451980,2463020," like thing in here that creates. Yeah. So, and what if I do minus 10? Right. What if I do minus 10?"
2464060,2471740," Do we have any additional information? At some point it just like always succeeds. Which is kind of weird."
2471740,2478540," Right. Which is kind of weird. But okay. So, let's actually do minus 100."
2478540,2488620," Okay. So, that's a lot. So, maybe we missed the whole thing. Let me see. All right. So, minus 100 doesn't"
2488620,2495820," make much sense. Like what about minus 20 then? Okay. So, minus 20 doesn't make sense. Okay. So,"
2495820,2503660," you probably can go further in x. Can you? Probably not. Right. If I do like plus one. After plus one."
2503660,2509340," Okay. So, that's the entire thing essentially. And there's like this weird square where you can do this"
2509340,2522380," stuff. Right. So, I'm just trying to understand what's the. What's the possible. Like can I just do"
2522380,2530060," mean y. Right. What if I put like 10 in here? What if I put 10 and there is like"
2530060,2536860," six of these things in here? Right. If I put one. There's okay. So, I feel like I can just use mean y."
2537500,2545500," That's what it feels like. It feels like I can use mean y. Right. And what about x? Do I have to do?"
2545500,2555660," Well, yeah. I can actually go high up. But to what extent? Right. To what extent? Does it make sense for me to?"
2557980,2567420," Yeah, I don't know. So, Vx is going to start for that from this thing."
2567420,2579980," Why? Right. Because if you're going to do mean y. Right. Even if one bigger than the entire mean y,"
2579980,2584700," you're going to just basically skip the whole thing. Right. So, you're going to just tunnel through the entire"
2584700,2591580," thing. I think anyway. So, it doesn't matter. Right. So, bigger than that doesn't make any sense."
2591580,2602860," The upper limit. I have no idea what to do with the upper limit. To be fair. Can I just like don't care"
2603420,2614700," about this thing? And simply. Yeah, I have an idea. What if I just make it very, very big? Right. What if we"
2614700,2627500," make upper limit huge? Right. So, and yeah. Maybe somewhere there. We'll find something. Right. So, at some point,"
2627500,2634540," it just like takes like a second or two. Right. So, this is half of a second. So, 2000. And if we take a look"
2634540,2645340," at the actual input, I'm pretty sure if we go with y to up 2000, we're going to roughly hit it somewhere"
2645340,2651580," there. If you know what I'm talking about. Right. So, yeah. Maybe we're going to actually do it like that."
2651580,2657980," So, we're going to basically eyeball it. Right. So, we're going to eyeball the brute forcing. So, yeah."
2657980,2667100," It's fine. And we'll see. We'll see how it goes. So, now I need to implement the actual solution or"
2667100,2673580," what not. I 64. Answer is going to be I 64. So, we have to find the maximum. So, I'm going to put the"
2673580,2683420," minimum. So, I'm going to put the minimum in here. So, let me now do if it is a success. Right. If"
2683420,2694540," success. If success answer answer is going to be maximum I 64 between the answer and the max dot H."
2694540,2701420," Right. And then I should be able to simply print the part one. Right. So, part one is going to be"
2702220,2708220," D. And this is going to be answer. Right. So, and we're going to do that on the sample first. And it"
2708220,2713260," didn't even. Oh, yeah. I also have to store the coordinates. I keep forgetting that I need to know"
2713260,2722460," the coordinates of this entire stuff. So, okay. So, this is not just answer. Let me quickly replace"
2722460,2730460," this entire thing. So, it's going to be answer. It's more of a like answer max height, max height,"
2730460,2736460," replacing everything within the selection. Right. So, boom, boom, a max H. And there we go."
2736460,2748460," So, and then we're going to have things like I 64. Answer this. And then I 64. Answer this."
2748460,2755260," And for this entire thing, maybe we want to put some sort of like values that stand out. Maybe I 64 mean."
2755260,2765260," I 64 mean. And this is going to be I 64 mean. Ah!"
2765260,2771260," Temple West. I hate it. Okay. So, if it is, if it's successful. Right. So, we have to do slightly"
2771260,2783260," different thing. If it is successful and the max height less than this thing, we have to do this thing."
2783260,2789260," We have to do this stuff. I really want to delete the whole line until the end and doesn't allow me to do that easily."
2789260,2797260," Okay. Okay. Okay. So, AVX, VX."
2797260,2807260," A, V, Y, V, Y. And A, Max, H, Max, H. I'm pretty sure there's like a way to solve it mathematically to just nail down the answer precisely analytically. But I'm a programmer. I don't give a shit about that mathematical bullshit."
2807260,2813260," So, let's go. I have a computer on my side and the computer can just like brute force this shit. So, who cares."
2813260,2823260," A, V, Y, A, V, Y, A, V, Y, A, V, and there we go. So, it was a 69. Was it 69 actually? It is. So, the above example is 69. Cool."
2823260,2835260," So, an above example using initial velocity is the best you can do, causing the prop to reach maximum Y position. 45."
2835260,2850260," I wonder if we can actually, you know. And what is the highest Y position it reaches? Wait, I'm an idiot. Yeah, well, I mean, I needed that information to just, to confirm that it is correct."
2850260,2877260," So, I think I'm an idiot. So, I don't need that. So, A, Max, H, and it's going to be basically 45. Alrighty. So, let's do the actual input. So, here we have MinX, which is 179."
2877260,2906260," MinX, which is 175. MaxY. Ooh, MaxY is MinY, rather. MinY, minus 34, minus 34. MaxX is 227. And then MinMaxY. MaxY, I said, minus 79."
2906260,2925260," I really don't like this way of doing things. Alright. So, I'm probably going to do something like this. Alright. So, MinX, 179, and then that, and then this, then that. So, this is minus 134."
2925260,2940260," Okay. So, and let's switch to the input. So, it's taking a little bit more time. Okay. 89.11. 89.11. Is it going to be correct? Is it going to be correct? We are about to find out. Probably not, because I'm an idiot. Yeah, it is correct. Okay, cool."
2940260,2959140," I wonder what's going to be the part two. Because, like, the part two this time is not particularly obvious, right? So, yeah. We'll see. Maybe it's even more. Maybe something that will invalidate this approach, right? So, maybe brute forcing for the part one is okay."
2959260,2973260," But for the part two is not going to be feasible. So, we're about to find out. Let's go ahead and see. Okay. Maybe a fancy trick shot isn't the best idea. After all, you only have one prop. So, you had better not miss."
2973260,2995260," To get the best idea of what your options are for launching the prop, you need to find every initial velocity that causes the prop to eventually be within the target area after any step. In the above example, there are 112 different initial velocities that meet this criteria. How many distinct initial velocities value?"
2995260,3005260," So, don't I already have the code for that? Don't I already have the code for that? Excuse me. So, I think I already do have a code for that."
3005260,3011260," So, let me... Are you serious?"
3011260,3024260," Count++. And let's go. Part two. Count. And let's take a look at the sample."
3024260,3037260," And 40. So, 112 different initial velocity values that have this criteria. Okay. So, that didn't really work."
3037260,3053260," Ah, I see. Okay. So, that's cool. That means I need to slightly refactor this entire idea. Okay. So, it's more of like this, right? So, this is the condition."
3053260,3058260," And I want to move the count somewhere here. Right? So, this is the count now."
3058260,3063260," And now I need to just auto-format it. I wish TempleOS had auto-formatter."
3067260,3072260," But Zodin, why don't you implement auto-formatter for TempleOS? Well, why don't you implement it?"
3072260,3078260," Okay. So, let me see. So, that should be... That should be it. It didn't compile."
3078260,3085260," 79. 79. And... What do you want from me?"
3085260,3098260," I don't understand what they want from me. Unused variable. Saved. Begin. Invalid L value. Invalid L value at 79. Where is the 79?"
3098260,3115260," A max h. Invalid L value. Invalid L value. There is no invalid L value anywhere. It's 70. So, there was like 75, but it's like not telling me."
3115260,3130260," Oh, shit about that. Um..."
3130260,3135260," Anyway. So, it does work for this entire thing. Right? So, and..."
3135260,3138260," Uh... Let's try to maybe switch to..."
3138260,3141260," Uh... To the input sample. And..."
3141260,3148260," Uh... Let's see. So, and for... For the part two, we have 47, 48. Is it gonna be 47, 48?"
3148260,3153260," Okay."
3153260,3157260," Cool."
3157260,3164260," I guess the additional challenge here is that you can spend a lot of time..."
3164260,3171260," Uh... So, maybe the... The trap of this problem is to nerd snipe you. I think."
3171260,3177260," I think this is the main trap of this entire problem. Because I can see somebody being nerd sniped so hard."
3177260,3186260," They will go deep into differential equations and simulations of physics and stuff like that to come up with a single formula that gives you the answer right away."
3186260,3187260," Right?"
3187260,3192260," I can see somebody being nerd sniped for like a couple of days doing all of that stuff."
3192260,3197260," Uh... But in reality, you can just like brute force the... All of the possible things and it will just work."
3197260,3201260," Right? So, it's just like choose your own adventure essentially. Choose your own adventure."
3201260,3207260," Okay. That... That's it for today, I suppose. This was the 17th day of Advent of Code in the God's Temple."
3207260,3210260," temple see you on the next one and love you"
