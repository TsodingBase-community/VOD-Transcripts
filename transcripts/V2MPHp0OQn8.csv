0,4400," uh all righty so i don't have that much time left so maybe we're gonna do something fun"
4400,11840," uh one of the things i have in here so here is a super sampling which is like anti-aliasing which"
11840,17840," i kind of implemented right so um but i need to implement it for different things right"
17840,28640," so let's put it to do in here uh anti maybe a a4 triangle and uh also a a4 line um a4 line"
29760,35760," uh for rectangle i'm pretty sure for for the rectangle we don't really need any anti-aliasing"
35760,41920," right i don't think it makes much sense so and here i have a 3d triangles uh 3d triangles include"
41920,49200," like implementing a lot of uh rather um complicated things right because one of the things i wanted to"
49200,54160," implement here as well is z buffering right so because i want to be able to render triangles that"
54160,61200," intersect each other right so and maybe also do a little bit of z fighting right so uh i think i'm"
61200,68400," not going to implement specifically 3d triangles we can try to implement uh maybe circles that are"
68400,74640," floating in 3d let's let's try to do a little bit of a cpu 3d without any open gel or anything like that"
74640,85680," i think it's going to be interesting uh right so how do you do 3d at all right so because i i know that"
85680,92560," you can just like uh use one of the engines or one of the libraries or even in opengl uh you basically"
92560,99600," get the 3d automatically right but the question is how is it even implemented right how do you implement"
99600,110160," 3d so the the problem of implementing 3d is essentially you have um some points in a 3d space"
110160,117040," right so we have some stuff in the 3d space let's actually draw a cube uh it's a pretty scuffed cube"
117040,126880," but you get the point right hopefully you get the point so this is my uh cube right and you have some"
126880,134160," sort of a screen right you have some sort of screen and you have an observer yourself right and what you"
134160,143680," need to do you need to basically take all of these points and project them on the screen right so that's"
143680,148240," what you need to do you need to project them on the screen like that because this is basically how"
148240,155600," vision works right you have your eye here's the eye here is the screen and you need to imagine that this"
155600,163840," 3d scene is behind the screen it is behind the screen right and then we take the points in 3d space"
164160,169760," and what we need to do we need to somehow project them onto the screen uh in this sort of like a shape"
169760,177520," code right so and that's basically the problem that we're solving so what we have in here is um essentially"
177520,185120," the distance from the eye so this is the eye uh and this is the screen uh let's actually put like a"
185120,194080," screen and this is an object right so this is an object um and you also have some sort of a distance"
194720,205040," from your eye to the screen right so distance d so we have a point and uh you need to find point"
205040,215600," prime which is the point on this screen uh we can maybe denote uh some of the coordinates right so this"
215600,222160," is the z coordinate right so we're looking at this the whole thing from the side right we're looking at"
222160,231280," the whole thing from the side so that means uh here comes the uh the z axis and up in this particular"
231280,240800," sort of view is going to be y axis so an x from this point of view goes like deep it goes deep so it's"
240800,249520," it's not really that important so maybe i'm gonna even like put it like that there we go uh so maybe"
250800,252080," just maybe"
252080,265200," we're gonna say that um the screen is located at zero at z zero right it's located at z zero"
265200,272640," and the eye should be located at somewhere like minus one so the location of the eye let's actually denote all"
272640,281120," all of these like things uh i let's say that it's going to be located at zero zero right so it's located"
281120,289520," at the center x and y and in terms of z it's supposed to be located at minus d uh right so it's located at"
289520,298640," minus d so this is what we have uh screen in terms of like the center of the screen in here"
298640,306240," should be located at zero zero zero zero uh p uh has coordinates i don't know let's actually call"
306240,316000," them p x p y p z right so this is that and what's interesting about p prime"
317520,321840," is that it's a two-dimensional one right because it's on the screen"
321840,330480," if you like prime right how can we find all of this uh let's actually find only"
330480,337360," y of that projected point right only y of that projected point which will make it a little bit"
337360,344160," easy because that means we have to work only with uh p y p z point right so we sort of like project"
344160,352160," the center i think and we don't have to think about like anything else in here uh so we have um"
352160,360560," we have this line in here right we have this line and we already talked about"
362000,368480," we already talked about the formulas of the line right and how you can use it to actually find"
368480,376000," arbitrary point on the line right so let me actually maybe erase this entire thing"
376000,381680," so we're gonna erase this entire thing cool"
381680,391040," let me see so the formula of the line the the equation of the line is that y is equal to some k"
391040,398560," multiplied by x plus c and essentially what you need to do you need to find uh k and c and if you have"
398560,409760," two points right if you have two points uh you can find k as y y uh two minus y one divided by x two minus"
409760,420960," x one and a c can be found as uh i think it's like x one minus k y one if i'm not mistaken so i do"
420960,428400," have this formula in uh the library itself when i draw the line right when i draw the line where's"
428400,437360," it's just like a line okay so yeah c is basically uh k yeah so but it's actually y yeah okay"
437360,447040," i could actually maybe reinvent this formula again but i already reunited so many times like i'm too lazy to"
447040,455440," do that okay so we have something like this right so what i want to do effectively is to find k and c for"
455440,464720," this specific line between the i and p right so what that means that means that x one is going to be equal"
464720,472880," to well i mean we're actually doing that for y z right we're doing that for y z that means we have to replace"
472880,483280," x with z right because in our case as you can see z acts like x right z acts like s x uh so let's actually"
483280,490320," go ahead and maybe replace that stuff in here so this is going to be that that that uh and this is going to"
490320,494720," be z z z two z one and z one okay cool"
494720,503120," so in our case z one"
506960,511920," the first point the first point is going to be the i right and uh that means it's going to be minus d"
511920,526240," this is the z of the of this thing y one is going to be zero z two is p the z of the p and y two is p y"
526240,534000," right so uh let's try to find the decay for this thing right so this is going to be y two which is p"
534560,546800," y uh minus zero right so it's it's understandable uh then we're gonna have p z minus d which is plus d in"
546800,556800," that case right so because we already have minus d in here okay so this is that uh and then y one is"
556800,570320," going to be zero minus k um right minus k um minus minus minus zero maybe i'm not going to uh write minus"
570320,576800," zero p z plus d uh multiply by z one right"
580000,589280," all right so that's cool and then what we have to do we have to take the z of p prime right and z"
589280,594160," for this thing is actually zero uh right so if we"
594160,600080," essentially put y to here so it's going to be"
602560,607440," uh"
607440,612720," that is rather interesting"
612720,621840," okay so i suppose i confused myself"
625280,632400," what i was trying to come up with i was trying to reinvent the formula where you have p prime x"
632400,641360," p x divided by p z so this is what i was trying to end up with but i actually kind of failed to do that"
641360,644160," maybe because i'm already tired"
646720,653120," uh all right uh yeah i was trying to come up with this formula but i actually can"
653120,658000," completely messed up so let's actually try to quote this formula i suppose uh"
658000,664720," yeah because you just need to follow the process and yeah this is by the way the reason why"
664720,671600," i started to develop knock this is like precisely the reason why i started to develop knock because"
671600,679760," i do understand how to like do this entire process but i always mess up this process because i have to"
679760,684400," keep track of a lot of like many little things right this is something that i was talking about in"
684400,691520," in the knock streams right so like every time i'm trying to transform some formulas or stuff like that"
691520,698400," uh i just like mess up something like i just forget something and i i don't know what to do like"
698400,704320," but at the same time it's not like um doesn't mean i do not understand what i'm doing i do understand"
704320,709040," it's just like technically mechanically it's kind of difficult for me right so what i was trying to do"
709040,717120," i was trying to get this idea and then come up to this thing but i messed it up right uh so and i'm not"
717120,722320," sure maybe i should have just used knock in this in this particular case and the knock thingy that i was"
722320,728160," talking about is is this one if you're if you're interested in this thing all right um yeah"
728160,736480," so i'm gonna put it in here uh what you thank you so much for which prime subscription thank you thank"
736480,742880," you thank you thank you uh right so and essentially the idea is that if you have the point in 3d space"
742880,748720," you just take x and divide it by z and y divide by z and you get the point on the screen effectively"
748720,754960," right so there are some parameters depending on like how distant your eye is from the screen and"
754960,760640," stuff like that and from that you can compute uh you know point of view and everything but you have to"
760640,765600," come up to that like this mechanic with mechanical mathematical process and i suppose this is one of"
765600,772320," the reasons why people are so scared uh of the math as well because this thing that it also requires like"
773120,776240," doing this thing which is or which is super easy to fail"
776240,788160," so yeah let's go ahead and try to to maybe do that right so you know what i'm gonna do i want to take"
788160,795040," my code uh i want to take my code of the of the triangle right so here i have a triangle uh here's the"
795040,800800," triangle and this particular triangle example is actually rather cool because it's sort of like a"
800800,808080," boilerplate for like anything animational graphical with this library right so essentially i can just"
808080,818880," go ahead and copy paste this triangle in here right uh let me do 3d right so i'm gonna do 3d and uh maybe"
818880,825200," i'm gonna go ahead and just like remove everything related to triangle um so rotating point i didn't think"
825200,830560," we're gonna be a rotating point if i'm gonna be rotating point i can implement that right i'm gonna"
830560,836640," remove the triangle i'm gonna remove the circle and there you go so i have something uh right so let me go"
836640,847520," ahead and just compile this thing clang oh uh 3d 3d dot c right so let me let me see conflicting type names"
847520,852800," uh what is it uh what is it conflicting with oh okay so i see i have some stuff that i have not committed yet"
852800,857760," oh true true true i'll have to remove that"
857760,865280," revert the buffer why are you forcing me to do all of that stuff okay cool"
865280,872960," where is 3d uh okay so let's try to compile it one more time okay so it doesn't have a main because it's"
872960,882240," behind this macro right it is behind this macro so let's try to define this macro uh sdl platform"
882240,889520," uh dot c there we go right and uh as you can see we use functions that are not available so it's actually"
889520,897280," linked with sdl2 and maybe also with the math library uh there we go and if i try to run this entire thing so"
897280,907680," we basically have nothing right but now i can just go to the render i can go to the render and do olive c"
907680,916960," circle oc and let's just try to render a circle at the center somewhere right um with the radius maybe"
916960,926000," 16 i don't know uh and let's make it red right something like this so it's going to be uh red"
927280,933840," and 3d there we go okay cool so this is a red circle of course like maybe it would be nice to"
933840,941040," actually do something like 2020 uh right so it's it's a little bit nicer red color it's still bright"
941040,951200," but it's a little bit nicer if you know what i mean right it's a tiny bit nicer right uh so uh let's"
951200,960000," maybe generate like um maybe like a cube of um of circles if you know what i mean right so some sort"
960000,968080," of a cube of circles but we'll need to know uh what's the like the dimensions of that cube if you know"
968080,975680," what i mean what are the dimensions of that uh let me create some sort of a thing in here so maybe grid"
975680,983120," size uh we can we'll get a rate from rprtr thank you so much grid size let's say is going to be like"
983120,990000," around 10 right so this is like a grid size but then uh what's going to be the padding between the"
990000,996880," between the circles right so let me let me think maybe grid pad uh let's say it's going to be 10 right"
1002480,1010240," i think i want to call grid count right because it's kind of a discrete thing because then uh i want"
1010240,1018960," to know what's going to be the you know the size of a single like edge uh right so this is going to be"
1018960,1027680," grid size and if we do grid count uh multiplied by the padding we kind of get the size and pixels of this"
1027680,1035280," grid but not really because we have to do minus one do you know why right because the amount of like"
1035280,1044800," paddings is always count minus one you have three points and how many paddings do you have between three"
1044800,1053280," points you always have two and you have four uh points you have three paddings so it's uh basically grid"
1053280,1059920," count minus one multiply by paddings and the amount of paddings is the size that you have right that"
1059920,1067440," makes sense i guess uh all right so let's try to render all of that stuff right so let's actually try"
1067440,1075600," to render that in 2d uh we're going to start with uh the rows so it's going to be grid count plus plus y"
1076320,1085200," and then we're going to start with x right so we have x and y in here so this is the x and y and uh"
1085200,1092960," what we need to do we need to render the circle it should start from half of the width minus grid size"
1092960,1100800," divided by two right something like this divided by two and then we have to do plus x multiply by grid pad"
1101600,1108320," right so something like that uh maybe i should probably have like a different names for these"
1108320,1118880," things so then i can use y as a separate variable well i mean this has to be x right so this is going"
1118880,1126800," to be x but this one is going to be columns effectively right so this is the column and this is the column"
1126800,1136320," right and then we have y height row and here we have x and y right so that's what i mean so essentially"
1136320,1145040," that will generate a grid of uh of the circles and it kind of did right but what we're supposed to have"
1145040,1154800," in here is half of the grid size not count right grid size and not count"
1156400,1161760," all right so but we can see the square because the radius of the of the circles is too big or"
1161760,1169040," maybe the padding is not big enough right uh all right so this is the grid and we have actually"
1169040,1176320," too much of a padding i would say too so let's actually make like 50. right so this is the grid we have"
1183600,1189920," already that's pretty cool so maybe i'm gonna put the radius here to to the constants as well circle"
1189920,1201200," uh circle radius circle radius define circle radius um maybe 10 i want to make it a little bit smaller"
1201200,1207040," uh right so we already have a circle radius why didn't you tell well i mean it literally told me"
1207680,1215680," uh i also have this color so maybe i should use it as a color yeah maybe i should um let me move"
1215680,1219760," no like i can't move them because the pixels are defined here i mean i can move that with the pixels"
1219760,1227440," who said i can't do that i can just move all of that stuff with the pixels because i want to have my"
1227440,1232240," implementation along with my constants all right so there you go"
1232240,1240160," and uh so the circle i think i want to use this color for the circle i think it's a pretty nice"
1240160,1256720," color for the circle right circle color so this is row and column and interestingly enough i still would"
1256720,1267920," like to call this x and y right because it would make sense because then uh i could make it a 3d"
1268640,1274400," i could make it a 3d by throwing like another thing in here but throwing z in here but unfortunately i"
1274400,1285520," can't easily do that um right so because of that uh maybe i'm gonna call it like r so sort of like a"
1285520,1293600," real this is like the yeah we can actually call it c which stands for cell right because we're like doing"
1293600,1301040," that for a specific cell uh right for a specific cell and this one becomes just that"
1301040,1310000," so this is uh cx cx and c y"
1310000,1321200," all right cool so now as i already said we can try to make it 3d by introducing uh z"
1322080,1332800," z access so let's try to see if we can easily do that um and what's going to be the value of z"
1332800,1337040," um interestingly enough"
1337040,1347840," what i'm thinking is that maybe we should normalize this entire shot in the screen as well"
1348960,1353760," you know what do you know what i mean"
1353760,1365360," yeah i think we normalize that uh it's going to be easy because for example in open gel there is"
1365360,1370800," normalized device coordinates right there are normalized device coordinates and um"
1372080,1378960," they go from minus one one minus one one minus one one so we have basically a cube two by two by two by two"
1378960,1387600," and essentially you render everything within that cube and um so the screen if i remember correctly"
1387600,1396400," is assumed to be at zero right so everything in z positive is considered to be like visible right or"
1396400,1403440," something like that i think it doesn't even matter which one you consider visible or not um so yeah"
1403440,1409600," i don't think it matters that much so because of that maybe we're going to be actually doing all of that"
1409600,1416880," in the normalized device coordinates yeah i think we can try to do that in normalized device coordinates"
1416880,1424640," and because of that i'm going to say that okay um i'm going to take one and divide it by grid count"
1424640,1430560," so this is going to be the padding this is going to be the padding"
1431760,1441360," uh so in here width is basically one right not really one but it's actually two um"
1441360,1451920," i'm not really right so i can just take the grid size uh divide it by two and take like a negative part"
1451920,1459920," of it all right so that that make that make sense so on grid size minus grid size and since it's a minus"
1459920,1466960," maybe i can actually swap these things somehow like so uh it's a little bit cold in here"
1466960,1468800," so let me actually quickly close the windows"
1468800,1483440," oh freaking siberia isn't already a fall yes it's a fall in siberia what's the"
1484240,1488240," what the temperature in siberia it's just second where the nova siberia"
1488240,1491600," uh the boat is dead"
1491600,1497680," oh okay it's it's plus 10 but it's it's night actually so it's a night time right now"
1497680,1502000," so maybe tomorrow is going to be more warm"
1506720,1515120," so okay so in our case z we're gonna put z let's render it like half right and it probably doesn't"
1515120,1521840," really matter so right now so uh i'm gonna just like you know ignore it for now i just want to"
1521840,1529440," translate everything to normalize device coordinates uh okay right once we figure out x"
1530960,1537440," right once we figured out x which is by the way floating point in here so all of that stuff is a"
1537440,1547920," is a floating point and now what we want to do right we want to multiply them by the actual width and"
1547920,1550000," height of the sort of screen"
1550000,1556800," so let me do it like that"
1556800,1564800," so this is going to be the float and then i can take x x is supposed to be from minus one to one"
1564800,1571520," right it's from minus one to one and essentially i want to translate it to zero"
1572240,1579440," one right so if i have something like minus one to one i can add one to it effectively translated it to"
1579440,1587040," zero two and then divide it by two and that way i have a value from zero to one and then i can multiply"
1587040,1595920," it by the width and that will give me a value from zero to two width right so and that's effectively"
1595920,1607600," what i want to do in here uh plus one and divide it by two multiplied by height right so that's what we"
1607600,1623920," have cool so and all that will effectively depend effectively depend on the uh on the screen size so yeah"
1623920,1630320," it actually kind of repeats the the aspect ratio of the of the screen but maybe that's fine for now"
1630320,1637520," right so we don't really care about it too much okay so let's try to introduce the z axis right let's"
1637520,1648000," try to introduce the z axis uh and this one actually is divided by one all right i'm not sure if that's"
1648000,1660640," particularly good idea but we'll see uh int c z zero z less than grind uh grid count uh plus plus z right"
1660640,1669520," so and here we have a float and z is probably gonna start at"
1671760,1676960," some sort of a padding so let's actually establish that it's gonna be after the screen at zero zero"
1676960,1686640," maybe one uh plus cz multiplied by grid pad there we go so it's multiplied by grid pad so it's gonna go"
1686640,1696320," uh in like to uh from us so it's going from us uh all right so the the next thing we want to do we want"
1696320,1704640," to project this point in 3d space to our screen uh we can do that by dividing it by z right and we have"
1704640,1711840," to be careful to make sure that z is not equal to zero otherwise we're dividing by zero and what's"
1711840,1718640," interesting is that if the z equal to zero that effectively means that the point is right in our eye"
1720000,1725680," that's why division by zero is not defined right so because you can lose your eye right if you divide"
1725680,1732080," divide by zero you instantly lose your eye because you have something in your eye uh right at the the"
1732080,1744240," position of zero right so and uh after that uh we can try to essentially um render that point like so"
1745040,1752080," so that should be fine i think so it didn't work properly so let me put the c z in here"
1752080,1761120," all right i wonder if it's gonna work and that is not bad does it look like something 3d though"
1761120,1770960," which is rather interesting so what if i say uh basically use one in here let's actually start with one"
1770960,1776000," right so what is the like the first thing in here we can't see in this mist that's actually really"
1776000,1784320," surprising uh what if i have two of them uh we have like two of them so i have a feeling that oh i know"
1784320,1790160," what's going on i think it's too close to us and that's why we can't see what if"
1790160,1798080," we start from half right and let's actually render one thing in here we start okay and we can see all"
1798080,1808400," of them so there's supposed to be 10 of them uh 3 3 3 1. you know how i count things usually for some"
1808400,1815520," reason my brain likes to count things by three right so three is such a simple number that you can actually"
1815520,1823040," recognize three objects without counting them have you noticed that by the way at least my brain right"
1823040,1830240," so if i see three objects i never have to count them because three cons objects are instantly recognized as"
1830240,1836640," three objects right so and what i usually count is i count the groups of three objects and because of"
1836640,1844560," that like i have three groups of three objects i know this is nine and then i have one you use three"
1844560,1849360," or five for some reason my brain isn't capable of recognizing five as a single object i always"
1849360,1857360," recognize five as one three and one two right so i have to do that that additional logical step usually"
1857920,1866560," okay so at half of the way we can see the entire thing which makes me think what if we take the padding"
1866560,1874720," as 0.5 and divide it by the amount of things right and that's going to be our padding right so i'm going"
1874720,1882240," to just start with that uh can we see okay so we can see in here so what if i have two of those things"
1883120,1892560," right so we can actually go deeper so we can try to do another layer in here you see where i'm going"
1892560,1900240," with all that you see where i'm like it's actually starting to look like 3d i'm not using opengl or"
1900240,1904720," anything like that so that's that's quite important to remember i'm not even using opengl or anything"
1905520,1912240," all right um okay so i just like made it even smaller and we can actually try to use like the"
1912240,1919360," full thing in here like a grid count uh all right and this is more or less like a full cube"
1919360,1928000," but the problem with this full cube is that uh you can't see that it's actually 3d you need to make it"
1928000,1939200," move or rotate to actually feel it's 3d mess is that even a word i don't know uh so we can also"
1939200,1946080," make it like maybe smaller maybe like five by five right so yeah so that's like looks a little bit"
1946080,1952720," better um but you you cannot tell is that 3d or is it just like the the points that go from the center"
1952720,1957840," right you can't see 3d unless it's spinning so let's actually try to rotate it"
1957840,1968560," so uh we're gonna be rotating it uh maybe around the y-axis right let's try to rotate it around y-axis"
1968560,1978960," so okay but the question is how that means we have to rotate y and z right we need to rotate y and z"
1982720,1992560," so and we need to figure out what is the center of rotation so let's say i already taken c i got"
1992560,2003120," fucking damn it okay um i wanted to use c y as the center and c z but they are already taken"
2003120,2012240," god damn okay so maybe i should rename that so let's rename cx to something else uh what should i call it"
2012240,2020560," so it's more of an index uh maybe we can call it i x right so it's just like an index uh the same goes"
2020560,2033360," in here right by y uh and this is easy okay so in terms of like y the center is located at zero right"
2033360,2042080," so this is no doubt then the center for z uh the z the entire thing z starts at half uh so maybe we"
2042080,2051280," we want to move this uh we want to move this uh somewhere right it's easy start right uh zero five"
2051280,2061280," and zero five uh z started there we go so we start somewhere here and then what we want to do we want"
2061280,2071520," to take the grind not great great size and divide it by two right because we're going like deep into this thing"
2072080,2079200," and the center of this thing is going to be somewhere there so this is effectively um you know the center"
2079200,2080720," okay so let's say"
2080720,2084480," um"
2084480,2086880," so this is z"
2086880,2101280," no if we are rotating around the y axis that means we have to use cx and cz yeah so we have the x and z okay"
2101760,2110480," so it doesn't really matter so it's going to be the same for cx it's also zero um so let's actually say"
2110480,2124960," that z is going to act like y right so in our case x plays the role of x right so x plays the role of x"
2124960,2132320," x and uh z plays the role of z of of y okay so let's actually find the distance between them so it's going"
2132320,2144080," to be dx um we take x minus cx and uh z uh z minus z okay that's cool so now what i want to do i want to"
2144080,2153840," find the angle uh of this thing so the angle is going to be a 10 2 uh d z d x and i put z first"
2153840,2158800," because z in that case acts like uh y coordinate right so it plays the role of the y coordinate"
2158800,2166560," right so then we want to find magnitude and magnitude is essentially squared f d z d z uh what's that with"
2166560,2173840," dx dx dx plus d z d z and there we go we have a magnitude so this is the angle but we have to"
2173840,2180320," constantly update that angle right so we have to keep track uh of maybe some sort of a global angle"
2180320,2185760," which starts at zero and every time we update we take the next frame we do angle plus"
2186320,2194400," two pi multiply by dt so we have like a one round per second yeah that's that sounds fine right so it's"
2194400,2204160," basically the same speed as rotating the triangle that we have okay cool uh so now what i can do in here"
2204160,2216320," so i can say that so this is our end one here uh but i need to i need to call it something different"
2216320,2224160," right so this is the angle of the uh of the vector in here so let's call it like a and m whatever uh"
2224160,2228400," all right and then i want to convert everything back right so how do i convert everything back i do"
2229280,2242720," dx equal to um so x is cosine uh a plus angle right so a plus angle multiply by m so this is d z uh a"
2242720,2252880," plus uh this one is going to be sine right okay so we've got rotated dx and dz which we have to convert"
2252880,2258800," back to um to x and y right we have to convert them back to x and y"
2259440,2263280," so that means we have to add them so x is going to be"
2263280,2281760," dx plus cx and y is going to be z is going to be dz plus cz right so we are basically converted"
2281760,2288480," everything back and then we project the entire thing to uh to the screen and then we render that on the screen"
2289520,2294240," all right so uh that's how we're going to be rotating so i know that you can use like the"
2294240,2301840," matrix for rotating this entire thing but i'm too lazy to to come up with the matrix so a10 well i mean"
2301840,2313680," it's already rotating uh god damn it's rotating fast so yeah isn't it cool i think it's pretty cool so i"
2313680,2321280," think we have we have to have like a even amount of numbers so we don't have that weird um how to say"
2323360,2332720," weird axis right so and maybe it has to be slightly slower uh so and also a10 too it has to be f uh"
2332720,2340800," right and it's too fast so uh okay so let's actually do something like this it's the other way around"
2341440,2350400," yeah boy it has to be even slower and furthermore i have to use the f thingy for both cosine and sine"
2350400,2354160," so that should be for oh my god"
2356720,2363440," look at that mother flipper look at that mother flipper isn't that freaking cool meat"
2363440,2368160," all without open jl yeah that's not cool"
2368160,2370160," okay it's pretty cool"
2370160,2376480," so uh so what about like 25 i want to make it even smaller"
2377520,2387280," make it even smaller yeah boy boy 3d without open jail this is how open jl is like basically works right"
2387280,2399440," why do you use clang instead of gc i just implemented like a 3d graphics from scratch without open jl and the"
2399440,2405360," choice between two compilers is the only thing you're interested in right now seriously"
2408400,2412640," is that the only interesting thing you have on the screen right now or is it just what"
2412640,2421520," come on don't disappoint me do not disappoint me okay and you know what's interesting is that we can"
2421520,2432480," actually try to we can try to compile that to uh to web assembly and we can try to uh can you make it"
2432480,2438720," bigger cover an entire canvas i mean cover covering entire cameras basically the question of making it"
2438720,2445360," closer right so let's actually put like a 25 uh right um yeah"
2445360,2456080," we can also make the resolution a bit bigger so let's actually do 16 9 multiply by factor"
2462480,2473280," it's just like i don't know"
2473280,2487040," i feel like i can find a cure for cancer in front of everyone in front of everyone and there will be"
2487040,2493120," always one guy who asks something like but why did you do that emacs in emacs instead of theme like why"
2493120,2493760," does it matter"
2493760,2501040," why does it matter why people care about such a trivial not important things"
2501040,2510480," why it's just like ah okay i'm trying to do cool and people just ask about this trivial not important"
2510480,2522640," things like why i don't understand that just like makes me sad it just like makes me sad you know what"
2522640,2532480," i mean okay so let's try to come uh maybe compile that to uh i'm sorry like i'm not attacking any one"
2532480,2538720," person or anything i'm just saying that this kind of question just makes me a little bit upset i'm just"
2538720,2548000," saying right so i'm not saying that the argument of like choosing the compilers is like invalid or"
2548000,2555120," anything it does matter but in the context in this specific context like it's why does it even matter"
2555120,2563120," why does it even matter i don't know anyway i'm sorry sorry should come down uh let's try to build that"
2563120,2572480," as the uh as i think um so i think i'm gonna actually put like put that stuff into examples"
2572480,2576400," and now i feel like an asshole like i don't know"
2576400,2579440," this is like"
2579440,2591520," i'm not trying to be mean or anything like that i'm just like saying my actual feeling and now i feel like"
2591520,2596320," like an asshole right so i guess i am an asshole i guess i just have to accept that i'm freaking"
2596320,2603840," asshole right people are just genuinely asking important questions and i'm just being mean to them"
2603840,2608800," and being an asshole and there's nothing i can do about that i guess i'm just like naturally an asshole"
2608800,2618400," person anyway so uh let's let's continue it's just like yeah keep in mind that i'm an asshole every time"
2618400,2619120," you ask me ask a question"
2619120,2629120," there's just there's nothing i can do about that maybe maybe i was born an asshole"
2629120,2633440," uh yep"
2633440,2645200," born through the asking anyway uh okay so this thing does not work because why uh file not found um that's"
2645200,2645840," very strange"
2645840,2651040," oh because i never actually uh compiled anything"
2651040,2657920," all right this works in the browser"
2657920,2668800," so it's also not perfect cube right because we're pretty much dependent on aspect ratio"
2669920,2672000," but yeah this thing works in the browser as well"
2672000,2677840," it's pretty cool and the fact that we're rendering that pixel by pixel is actually also pretty cool"
2677840,2679840," why not firefox"
2679840,2685200," that's a good question thank you thank you for asking"
2685200,2688080," it's like"
2688080,2693680," it's it's it's all cool you know but zosian why did you paint them red"
2694560,2697920," do you hate blue please explain yourself no"
2697920,2703280," oh you implemented 3d without open gel that why did you use red"
2703280,2709600," why did you use red why didn't you use blue you hate blue you're a blue hater anyway"
2712480,2722480," um okay gosh i'm such an asshole i i just can't help myself why am i such an asshole"
2722480,2730560," right so uh dark my 10 thank you so much for twitch prime uh does anyone have any questions i think"
2730560,2736800," i think we already went over uh went over like two hours and we have like so many people watching"
2736800,2744240," this okay so why why do you why do you all watch an asshole ranting about i have a question why okay"
2744240,2745760," okay"
2755600,2758880," are you happy now are you happy"
2758880,2771200," okay let's actually maybe make it uh i don't know can we make it rainbowish you know what i mean how can"
2771200,2773440," we make it rainbowish so essentially"
2773440,2783920," uh we can try to split the whole space in three points and then we can interpolate"
2784640,2788160," between like three points it's too much work i don't want to do it right now"
2788160,2799760," uh let's put this way um you inserted two circle colors uh right so and let me just put this thing in here"
2803520,2808560," so this one is going to be red"
2808560,2810400," uh ff 20"
2810400,2811680," uh boom"
2811680,2814640," it's going to be ff"
2815680,2829840," um so how easy how would it be to make a function that spins whatever drawing you throw in it so we need to"
2829840,2836480," have at least uh support for textures and we need like a mechanism that can map texture in 3d space"
2836480,2838880," okay so that's actually a lot of work um"
2838880,2841440," it's pretty hard right now"
2841440,2848080," but it's not impossible if we just like put some effort into that but it's not like a single stream"
2848080,2849600," it's let me make two three streams"
2849600,2853680," uh right so we have to implement a lot of things in here"
2853680,2860640," okay so for the color uh i'm going to just do circle colors um let's actually put the color in here"
2861360,2875520," you in 32 color uh what is that i z divided by circle uh colors count all right so of course count"
2875520,2888800," okay so this one is going to be essentially size of uh circle course divided by size of circle course"
2890080,2897600," okay all right all right all right so let's try to recompile this entire thing boy boy boy boom"
2897600,2899040," so yeah"
2899040,2905200," hey every color for everyone i mean we probably have to"
2905200,2915280," do also the combinations of colors right so like a yellow cyan magenta or something"
2917200,2923120," uh let me let me actually see maybe we can we can do that so let me let me see let me see"
2923120,2940640," okay so the next thing is going to be like pairs so this is going to be ff then uh f20 and then maybe"
2942080,2948640," 20 like so right we're going to have enough like like layers to even do that that's a good question so"
2948640,2957280," yeah so we have like six of them so we're already or yeah we're already used to them so there's like six"
2957280,2963760," uh let's actually make 10 uh right so they're supposed to like circle right they're supposed to circle so"
2964640,2969760," that's that's that's that's a mess that's a fruit salad um oh yeah"
2969760,2976560," and also they are not rendered according to their z axis so it's kind of like"
2981200,2989680," it's a pretty dang it's a pretty dang i've got an idea"
2989680,2999120," let's actually do something like uh ix plus uh i y plus i z"
3005600,3007920," oh this this is a mess okay"
3007920,3013920," uh all right all right all right all right all right"
3013920,3033520," i've got an idea actually so let me try to do that um we can yeah so we can do y x and we can divide it by"
3033520,3039360," the grid count right so we can divide all that by the green count so this is going to be float"
3039360,3044480," and this is going to be float and then i can multiply by 255 but effectively what i can do"
3044480,3051520," is just multiply this by 255 and then just divide it by this and i've got what what i need to do so this"
3051520,3063520," one is going to be uh red let's assign this to red then g and then b or in this case this one is going"
3063520,3070640," to be z and let's construct a quarter out of those mother flippers right so this is going to be alpha"
3070640,3077600," zero zero zero zero zero okay so we're gonna do that red is first as far as i know it's just like"
3077600,3085280," zero bytes right this is zero bytes and then this one is going to be g and this one is going to be"
3085280,3094720," b so g is one byte this one is two bytes right and this one is three bytes okay so then um essentially"
3094720,3100400," so does it compile i think it compiles and that's actually holy that's so cool"
3104560,3111520," this is basically rgb space right so somewhere at the angle we have black and the other angle"
3111520,3116640," other i'm sorry in russian language corner and angle are the same words"
3116640,3124640," i'm sorry like literally in we use the same word for the notion of angle and corner so in one corner"
3124640,3130160," you have black and another corner you have white essentially what i can do right now i can remove"
3130160,3136880," everything and leave only the corners i use the right word i can use only the corners and then i can"
3136880,3142720," basically connect them with triangles that we already know how to draw triangles and then we'll have an"
3142720,3150000," actual 3d effectively right um but what's interesting is that i won't be able to implement z buffer so and"
3150000,3155200," what i'm thinking is that how would i implement z buffer i would have to do an opposite operation of"
3155760,3164880," projecting the triangle to the screen right so let me show you so i have a screen i have the eye and um"
3164880,3172240," i have the triangle right so this is a 3d space triangle right here's an eye and i projected the"
3172240,3179920," triangle on the screen somehow right so i've got three points and there we go so this is three points and"
3179920,3185760," then i draw the triangle on the screen as usual but then i want to figure out the z axis of each"
3185760,3192480," individual pixel of that triangle right so for instance i'm drawing this pixel of the triangle"
3192480,3202080," right what is the z value of that pixel what i'll have to do i'll have to project that pixel back on the"
3202080,3207440," triangle right so i'll have to take the eye i have to like draw a line from the eye and through that"
3207440,3214960," that specific pixel back to the uh back to the triangle and only then i'll know the z value and"
3214960,3221280," that way i can fill up the z buffer and then we can use the z buffer to actually cut out the uh you know"
3221280,3228720," different triangles and stuff like that um and this is rather hard right so essentially you have 3d line"
3228720,3239600," right 3d line uh and then you have a 3d plane right 3d plane and you need to find the point of intersection"
3239600,3245040," of 3d line and 3d people okay it's not that hard for you math students and stuff like that but i'm this"
3245040,3252080," kind of person that doesn't understand unless i can like reinvent it right for instance i use this formula"
3253120,3258000," and i managed to reinvent it once so i kind of understand it but at the same time i couldn't"
3258000,3263280," reproduce that so i don't understand but anyway so for me it's kind of important to sort of like"
3263280,3272400," reinvent this entire process so that's why i consider that hard uh so yeah that's basically my thoughts"
3272400,3280720," about the z buffer anyway so that's it for me uh thanks everyone who's watching right now i really"
3280720,3288560," appreciate it can you just use interpolation from the z coordinate of the corner so i could use that"
3288560,3295520," but the projection actually screws everything up so the projection is not linear that's the problem"
3296240,3304400," you just can't do that linearly i don't think so um you can interpolate one over z what that's"
3304400,3312960," that's actually a pretty cool idea nifty wifty wait"
3312960,3321920," that kind of makes sense i'll need to think about that thank you uh because that also makes sense it"
3321920,3330000," it's actually easier the projection destroys information yeah that's true if you interpolate my uh"
3330000,3338880," one over z okay thank you thank you so much i'll think about that all right uh so thanks everyone for"
3338880,3346720," watching uh maybe we should rate somebody right so because um we were rated by people so we have to give"
3346720,3351520," back to the community um"
3351520,3360640," yeah learning math through programming is actually super fun because it's like it's visual you can you"
3360640,3368000," can actually see uh so george hot's actually streaming but we're not gonna rate him because he already"
3368000,3374560," has shit on the viewers so that he should rate us instead right so the bigger streamers have to help"
3374560,3382800," smaller ones it is not correct to like for a smaller streamer to rate like a bigger one uh okay let me see"
3382800,3386560," i want to rate somebody who's smaller streamer right so"
3386560,3396000," super super slow so do we have anyone who's developing"
3397760,3402960," compiling is dead i really like this title and they're programming in java"
3402960,3406560," uh they're doing game deaf and java"
3406560,3409280," um"
3409280,3417200," reverse engineering reverse engineering actually sounds interesting"
3423440,3431040," mm-hmm is this really reverse engineering"
3431040,3440240," it doesn't look like a reverse engineering i'm sorry twitch why is it so bad oh my god"
3440240,3446800," it's unbearable this is the most unbearable website of every okay so maybe i'm gonna actually"
3446800,3453120," right here def because he's doing c plus plus which is rather like close to what we're doing um"
3453440,3468880," well that's real so far i've seen some ms paint i'm sorry so i know nothing about the streamer and"
3468880,3473040," this one was my first impression so i'm sorry about that um"
3475680,3478240," uh come on"
3478240,3489840," all right so i started the rate hopefully the interface hasn't updated on me yet so okay so it's"
3489840,3498240," updated cool all right so that's it for today thanks everyone and i love you all get ready for the rate get"
3498240,3501120," ready for the rate"
