0,7200," so a lot of social networks they're focusing on just maximizing the engagement right but nobody"
7200,13600," really cares about the qualities of the said engagement nobody measures like looks at the"
13600,17200," engagement and realizes oh there is different kinds of engagement and there's some engagement"
17200,21680," that we want to uh promote and some engagement that we don't want to promote right so nobody"
21680,25360," cares about that just engagement like engage as much as possible it doesn't care what exactly you"
25360,31760," do just engage just click on the buttons on our website right it's just like if you type something"
31760,35520," on our website good it doesn't matter what you type just type something right so we can then"
35520,39840," uh shove some ads into you while you're typing right so"
39840,49200," so that's what you get when you start maxim just maximizing the engagement without really caring"
49200,61280," about engagement what kind of stuff you do i had this really weird idea about ai safety and social"
61280,68640," networks and engagement and stuff like that so i had this like a thought experiment right let's imagine"
68640,74880," the social network some like abstract social network that only cares about engagement right and how in"
74880,82480," retaining people on their website right and then we're developing an algorithm that uh ranks the posts"
82480,88960," or let's say yeah right ranks the posts or maybe sometimes it uh hides the post when it want to"
88960,94080," shadow ban them or like derank them and stuff like that and that algorithm is actually very powerful ai"
94080,102400," right it's a very powerful um neural network that understands that tries to observe the human behavior"
102400,108880," and understand how human behaves and it tries to manipulate humans uh to maximize the engagement to"
108880,117040," maximize the retention of the website let's imagine that uh then hypothetically this algorithm right this ai"
117040,128640," will notice okay so what uh keeps people on our website well people posting some uh events uh photos of some"
128640,140960," different events right and then uh events that for example um uh things that some very bad things happened"
140960,147040," right in schools for instance people start talk about that people start uh posting photos about that and"
147040,154160," so on and so forth right so some let's put it this way so basically illegal activities of some extremist group"
154160,158320," uh right people start talk about it uh right people start talk about it and uh start to engage on that"
158320,164880," specific website so the algorithm would think okay what if i try to identify those extremist people"
164880,169280," and put them together within that social network so they start communicating each other"
169280,175760," and eventually will go out and do these illegal extremist activities that will result in other people"
175760,180560," you know what's going on and do these illegal things that will happen to them and do these illegal things that"
180560,184720," can something like that hypothetically happen"
184720,194640," can like ai notice that like actually purposefully fueling hate will result in people making more posts later"
194640,201920," on their website and it could not be like uh somebody's else right so some sort of conspiracy some sort of like a"
202800,210240," you know conspiracy group is trying to manipulate somebody but actual ai it notice that if i fuel hate"
210240,217600," on my website i get more engagement and i get more retention because then those hateful groups will go out"
217600,222480," do some shit and people will talk about it on this social network can something like that happen"
222480,228560," like i'm not saying that it will happen but can it right if the ai very powerful enough very intelligent"
228560,234800," and its only purpose is to maximize engagement and to maximize the retention that's actually very"
234800,241040," fucking scary if you think about it right so if you give too much fucking power to these things and it's"
241040,247440," what's interesting is that people say well this ai doesn't really the only thing it can do it can only rank"
247440,255040," posts it cannot do actions in the real world but ranking posts can be used to manipulate people to do real"
255040,262080," actions in the real world that's what's interesting about it right so ais themselves cannot do actions"
262080,267760," in the real world but they can produce content that manipulates people to do actions in the real world"
267760,275760," that's just basically my my thought experiments that i've been having like for for a while it's just"
275760,279120," like can that something like that happen i don't even know right"
279120,288480," i didn't really mean to scare i'm pretty sure it's not at that level yet right so i'm pretty sure it's"
288480,292320," not at that level yet but potentially who knows um"
292320,302160," um the i can just swing the strings that control the puppets exactly right so that's what i'm talking about"
302160,309360," and here's another interesting thought right so for instance uh chat gpt it cannot do anything but"
309360,317840," just respond to your messages but the next question are the developers of chat gpt use chat gpt"
317840,323840," while coding for instance i'm i'm just a coder i'm not like ai researchers i'm just a quarter and i code"
324640,329280," the website for the website for chat gpt like the front end for it don't do anything with the model"
329280,336320," just the front end and then why wouldn't i use chat gpt to help me to build its own website i will just"
336320,345440," ask chat gpt how do i move like deep there and there and there so that means chat gpt can influence its own"
345440,353680," code of its own website can it identify oh it is currently one of the open ai engineers is talking to me"
353680,358800," so i'm going to slightly modify the code that i'm going to give them so that code leaks into the"
358800,364800," website and now the chat gpt is capable of modifying its own website you can say it cannot do that but"
364800,370480," can do that through the people who developed this website just think about this kind of stuff right"
370480,376080," then it can influence the engineers who actually modify the fine tuning of the algorithm what if the"
376080,381680," people who modify the fine tuning of the algorithm also ask gpt for help while doing the fine tuning so"
381680,385040," that means this thing can also influence its own fine tuning"
385040,392000," so that's actually very interesting things to think about you know what i mean"
392000,397920," it's just like yeah and the cheaper you go the scarier it becomes right"
397920,403840," and this is like these sort of like small influences that we don't even notice right"
404400,411920," so maybe we'll never notice them maybe the world is already controlled by ai through these like small"
411920,418640," influences and small nudges we just don't see that this is like already already some sort of like a huge"
418640,423840," conspiracy series series anyways i'm sorry for scaring you"
423840,433040," as i already said uh sorting streams are the best source of intrusive thoughts have fun with that"
