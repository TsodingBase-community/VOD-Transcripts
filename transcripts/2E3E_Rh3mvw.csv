720,7040," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreation programming session with"
7040,12080," a mr azuzin uh let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start the stream"
12080,17600," write the circle live on twitch and what are we doing today on twitch.at television website"
17600,24960," today we are doing hair programming language that's right so i'm gonna give the link"
25600,31840," to where we're doing all that to twitch.tv and i'm going to ping everyone who's interested in being"
31840,37280," pinged and there we go the stream has officially started the stream has officially started hello"
37280,44000," hello everyone welcome welcome welcome so uh this language was on my to-do list for quite some time"
44000,51280," right so i think somebody posted the link to this language in our discord server and uh it's actually"
51280,56320," very interesting like i like the marketing of the language right so it's a system programming"
56320,64400," language uh designed to be simple stable and robust i do like simplicity right so and i do like simple"
64400,71200," technologies and i think the simpler technologies are the future right when the tower of abstraction"
71200,78320," layers will finally topple the simpler technologies and people who can write a simpler code will dominate"
78320,83120," the industry in a in the future maybe in the new future maybe like in 10 years or something like"
83120,87760," that but i do believe that simple technologies are the future because the tower of abstractions keep"
87760,92880," growing and growing and at some point it's going to topple we know that that at some point is going to"
92880,96800," topple and we're going to start stripping off all of that and finally do the"
96800,103920," proper software engineering so anyway uh right so it uses static type systems right i really like static type"
103920,110000," system manual memory management so it's basically like c and minimal runtime so it is well suited to"
110000,116160," for writing operating systems system tools compilers networking applications and other low level high"
116160,122560," performance tasks uh right and it does look like c a little bit right so it does look like c but maybe"
122560,128640," it fixes some of the problems of c right so and that's exactly what i would like to maybe uh you know"
128640,133600," explore today right so this is something i would like to explore today as far as i know it's like"
133600,140320," it fits into three and a half floppy disks so that means that the installation should be relatively"
140320,146240," straightforward right so they say that you should install it from your system package manager but i i"
146240,152720," think i didn't find it on debian so we're probably gonna build it from scratch right and what's interesting"
152720,160080," is that it uses the like a very interesting backend for for itself like it doesn't use llvm or anything"
160080,166880," like that it's it uses something called qbe which is something that i may actually check out on its"
166880,170880," own because it's rather interesting so it's a compiler backend that aims to provide 70 percent of"
170880,178400," performance of industrial optimizing capabilities in 10 of the code right so one of the reasons i didn't"
178400,185840," want to use llvm because it's a it's a such a huge bloat right so if you're writing like a very simple"
185840,192400," language depending on the vm is just like it's too much it's a fucking overkill seriously it's a"
192400,199520," fucking overkill and something like that as an alternative to llvm sounds very uh very interesting"
199520,204640," i think it sounds very very interesting so it has a lot of like different features right so it doesn't"
204640,212640," have the you know the performance of like industrial optimizers like a lvm but it's a 70 percent it's a"
212640,220240," 70 percent so you trade of 30 for simplicity i i personally take it any day honestly i personally"
220240,226560," take it any day to be fair like um optimizing compilers the the role of optimizing compilers in"
226560,235280," the majority of applications is kind of overrated honestly i'm gonna say that the role of optimizing"
235280,242080," compilers in the majority of applications is kind of overrated and if that was not true python would"
242080,247520," not become popular again right i do care about performance right i do care about performance but"
247520,255760," at the same time yeah right so we we don't really need like a little bit we don't need to pay such a"
255760,261680," huge price for marginal improvements if you know what i'm talking about right so uh maybe this is"
261680,265360," something that we're gonna uh check on and so on but this is some of the things that you'll have to"
265360,271440," build as well um right so and then you need to have like a bootstrap compiler right so you have to"
271440,277760," bootstrap it so i suppose it is written in itself uh it's a very simplistic uh language it's a statically"
277760,282720," typed and it's written in itself right so this is actually pretty cool project honestly so i'm gonna"
282720,288960," give the link to uh to this thing in the chat right so i mean both already give it in the chat and for"
288960,297280," people in the uh on youtube i'm gonna put it in the description right so here programming language uh and"
297280,301200," this is from the previous stream i'm gonna just put a line in here so i can distinguish those"
301200,310480," things and here i'm gonna say references uh there we go so and then after we like build the bootstrap"
310480,317280," compiler we just build the original compiler all right so let's actually try to um build the backhand"
317280,324720," first right so i'm going to actually go to uh probe uh and then create a folder here uh post it"
324720,330080," combined at the moment with the c11 compiler i do think we have c11 compiler and i think we do have a post"
330080,336320," a post-ex compliant environment i do believe so the latest version is git master branch not the latest"
336320,341920," version release that's very interesting like the latest like development bleeding age so to speak"
341920,347440," uh right so let's actually take the code and see what we have in here okay so that was pretty straightforward"
347440,351920," i wonder if we have to do like everything i personally don't like to clone the entirety of the"
351920,356800," repos because sometimes they could be rather big if you know what i'm talking about right so i like"
356800,364240," to do depth one which actually only clones like a last commit so it's so called shallow clone uh right"
364240,369200," it is so called shallow clone so it's actually usually faster uh and as you can see we're done with this"
369200,374400," entire thing okay so do you have a config file uh it doesn't have a configuration file but it doesn't"
374400,382160," have to have make so we can probably just do make right away and see how it goes um and it's done actually"
382160,393360," so can your llvm do that can your llvm do that i don't think so llvm is in shambles"
396160,404560," um um but so you know you don't understand the enterprise clients the enterprise client they need"
404560,413440," over complicated checks you don't understand anyway so um i wonder how so this is basically like an"
413440,421120," executable right uh i suppose it is an executable because this entire thing it has its own intermediate"
421120,430480," representation right so quick comparison with lvm maybe so i do remember i do remember that um"
430480,436800," there was some example yeah there we go it kind of similar to lvm intermediate language i don't really"
436800,443040," know like lvm intermediate language but i remember a lot of weird characters and shit like that so and it"
443040,449360," does feel like lvm even though i don't really know lvm so and i suppose you just generate this kind of"
449360,457760," thing and it just compiles it and i suppose this thing is a compiler uh right so i probably can try"
457760,467920," to do something like this uh right so i don't know don't even know uh what kind of extension do you have"
467920,473760," to put in here is there some examples no there is no any examples in here uh maybe some tests there"
473760,480480," are some tests so it's called ssa right so the extension is supposed to be ssa can we do hello"
480480,490000," ssa uh right so this is the back end and i suppose i just do qb hello ssa and it generated assembly"
494240,502080," is it that simple okay okay that's actually not bad not bad this is not hair language yet this is"
502080,509920," its back end and i wonder how hair language uses it does it just call a qbe like an external process"
509920,516640," maybe it does but that's actually super cool i really like that so you just generate its intermediate"
516640,521680," representation and you just like call it and it gives you assembly and then you pass it to i suppose gnu"
521680,527920," assembler right because this feels like a gnu assembler and uh yeah that's basically oh and the node"
527920,536720," gnu stack do you guys remember this one because remember this one node gnu stack right it's so"
536720,541920," basically i mean you mean that the executable is not going to be like a executable or something"
541920,547200," yeah the warning so they also automatically do that and they also actually mark it as"
547840,553200," an empty one i forgot the stream where we encountered that does anybody remember the stream where we"
553200,560720," encountered that i think maybe brainfuck uh jits i think it's about brainfuck jit or something yeah yeah"
560720,566960," so it was a brain function uh so yeah so i literally guessed that you have to make it empty so when it was"
566960,573280," right it's kind of interesting anyway so this is the back end uh okay cool we build it that was easy that was"
573280,580560," fast so we need to take the bootstrap compiler uh the bootstrap compiler source code uh config platform so"
580560,589920," we have to do a little bit of a copy for a specific platform so read only uh i suppose that's the thing i"
589920,600480," have to do how you pronounce the compiler for hair uh and let's actually do git clone and i'm gonna also do"
600480,608080," the shallow clone uh depth one right so it says that it's a read only uh okay so we need to do the copy they"
608080,618720," say uh we need to do the copy um so copy uh configs and the platform what kind of platforms do we have"
618720,627440," so we have linux netbsd freebsd openbsd so i suppose we we do have linux and we just do config.mk"
627440,633680," so this is the configuration for the make file uh right so that is very cool and let's actually try to"
633680,638720," build this entire thing and see how it goes and while it is building so"
638720,645040," it's already done it's already done uh"
645040,650320," i wanted to acknowledge the subs while it is building but it's already done"
650320,657600," um so optionally do make check to compile and run the test to it as well as then run make install as root"
657600,665280," and then i don't want to do that honestly i don't want to do that uh so then um let's actually do check"
665280,676160," uh make check uh and okay so it couldn't find qbe uh and i wonder how am i supposed to even use qbe"
676160,683520," uh maybe it should be available in the system right so essentially it should be somewhere in the path"
684080,690640," so you know what i usually do you know what i usually do i usually just install extra executables"
690640,698320," uh into user local bin if you look at this uh specific folder here i have boomer my custom thing"
698320,706480," chat arena gf2 some stuff for sub stuff for editing the swoon the timer that i actually put on my uh things in"
706480,712640," here nst so these are executable that are not part of the system uh right so i actually installed them"
712640,719040," there um so and essentially maybe i want to do this kind of stuff in a similar manner right and i like to"
719040,724560," install them here because they become system-wide right so they become system-wide so i know that you can"
724560,730480," install them locally dot local and stuff like that uh but uh i like to keep them like available for"
730480,737200," several users because i have several users on this specific machine um all right so let me let me see"
737200,746080," so maybe i'm going to go to tmux and i'm going to go in here uh so this is qbe and might as well maybe"
746080,755920," copy paste it right so let's actually do the following thing i'm going to do copy uh user local bin right"
755920,766560," wizard local bin and then uh maybe something like this and just a second so i'm going to try to"
766560,770880," quickly do the sudo thing it's not really sudo it's just csu but anyway"
770880,783920," uh all right so i do have qbe in the path right so that means we can just go to haric and uh do make"
783920,789440," check and hopefully that actually passes all the checks so it's it's the tests right it's running"
789440,796080," the tests so that's pretty cool uh that's pretty epic uh i really like that so there's a bin uh and i"
796080,803520," wonder um like how are we supposed to use that so it wants you to do install right but i don't want to"
803520,812080," install it system-wide at least right now right uh i don't want to install system-wide so there is there is"
812080,819680," some include stuff right so there's some headers but it's not really so let's actually find this thing"
819680,826480," and what it does it just oh okay this is a single executable literally does it does it have any standard"
826480,833680," libraries or anything like that um so maybe it's like a self-contained executable right so the only thing"
833680,844160," i see is being uh high rock harris right so that's what it is that's what it is so maybe i'm gonna also"
844160,851840," go ahead and just copy it system-wide uh so i can just use it from um you know from the command line so"
851840,861520," let me quickly do that all right so we basically have it right so we have the back end that it uses"
861520,872320," we also yes we have uh here c here c so we are ready to basically do hello world uh right so let's do i"
872320,879440," i don't know what's the extension for this language by the way uh what's the extension extension maybe"
879440,885760," there is no official extension so let's take a look at the tutorial uh general language introduction"
885760,895760," table content uh getting starting uh getting started so the extension is ha the extension is ha okay so we're"
895760,906400," gonna do hello ha right so we're gonna do hello ha and uh so here is the hello world so it's basically"
906400,916960," like go you do use fmt uh use fmt and then you export right so you export we don't have an extension for"
916960,925360," emacs at all i wonder if there is any sort of like emacs support for this language uh that is kind of a"
925360,932800," shame that there is no okay so there's scripts um so we can try to maybe search for a file with the name"
932800,940000," ael uh and there's nothing so maybe we can go on melpa uh and if there is something on melpa"
940000,945680," um maybe there is something on melpa"
945680,954960," what is special about here google is going to adapt it so if you learn it right"
954960,956880," right now you can make a lot of money in five years"
956880,965280," so you have to learn here now sign up for my course on here and in five years you're gonna"
965280,967120," get a job at google what the"
967120,974480," so um so here right so here"
974480,982880," uh i think there is no extent it feels like there's literally no extensions for this language yet so maybe"
982880,987120," you will have an opportunity to make maybe make one um so"
987120,995760," it works it fucking works it fucking works"
995760,1006560," i feel like i figured it out i like for some reason it was not obvious for me for a very long time"
1007360,1012880," but i recently figured it out okay so there is a mode for for emacs uh thank you thank you so much"
1012880,1018160," um right so it was not obvious for me for a long time but i think i figured it out"
1018160,1027600," majority of people treat languages as cryptocurrencies like i think i figured it out i think i nailed it so"
1027600,1035760," essentially uh they want to invest into a certain cryptocurrency so then a certain company a certain"
1035760,1041760," fine company can adapt it and then they will have a bingo right so that's how they treat it"
1041760,1047840," which is so bizarre to me like i could never the reason why i could never understand that is that"
1048720,1057440," i can just learn any language right so this is like what is investment if you can just if you just know"
1057440,1063760," programming right and if you know programming you basically know all the languages right it's just like"
1063760,1070080," it it becomes like irrelevant and this is why it was not like really obvious for me like why people"
1070800,1077760," care about languages so much why people watch all of these like top 10 languages to learn in 2024 it's"
1077760,1082400," just like what why does it matter if you know programming it doesn't matter or i'm making it"
1082400,1090640," yearly so programming languages and everyone holy and it's just like why people care just learn programming"
1090640,1096560," and and that's it and i think i finally figured it out because it's a cryptocurrency for people"
1097360,1109520," it's a cryptocurrency right it's so bizarre to me it's so funny sad fascinating and informative at"
1109520,1118640," the same time it's just like oh so that's how it works okay anyway thank you so much for for the link"
1118640,1126400," so i think this is what we'll need in here uh right so and i'm going to copy paste this entire thing um"
1127360,1132960," at the same time i mean i i do understand like no no not really everybody teaches how to do"
1132960,1140400," programming nobody really teaches programming rather than a programming language and uh maybe it's my"
1140400,1146000," fault that i didn't create some sort of a course right so about programming in general and not a"
1146000,1153840," specific language but at the same time with my experience in making tech content on the internet i"
1153840,1160480," fucking know that nobody's gonna watch that like i fucking know that i can make a course on like"
1160480,1166480," general programming programming in general and i can just describe you how to just not care about"
1166480,1171600," specific language but to actually do programming and nobody's gonna watch that it's just like"
1171600,1181440," because it requires effort learning actually useful skills requires effort so i mean you personally would"
1181440,1186240," watch that right uh so random chatter in the chat you personally would watch that when i say nobody will"
1186240,1193760," watch it as i mean uh majority of people will not watch that right so yeah you you are in a minority"
1193760,1199040," of people who actually want to learn things and i do really appreciate you so thank you so much for"
1199040,1205760," being you uh but we know that majority of people just like nah nah it's not like they don't like"
1205760,1217280," they like how reality actually works so"
1217280,1224640," if you sell it like wow it's so good programmer gets rich like me you will sell but the problem is i'm not"
1224640,1231040," rich so that's the problem uh so the problem is that i'm not rich"
1231040,1243280," so the the reason why i'm not rich is that um as soon as i have enough money to sustain myself"
1243280,1252480," i cannot stop being motivated by money if you know what i mean it's just like uh as soon as i have okay i"
1252480,1257920," have a roof over my head i have something to eat i have something to rig okay i can focus on programming"
1257920,1263200," so that's how it usually goes for me so as soon as i okay so the basic things are done so i can focus on"
1263200,1270880," so that's how it is for me because of that i can't like i couldn't give a right so and for"
1270880,1277440," the longest time before i actually started to stream um i quit my job so there was a long period before i"
1277440,1283520," quit my like office job and started streaming and i did freelancer freelancing so what i would generally"
1283520,1290480," do i would just freelance for like short period of time accumulate a bit of money and then just like"
1290480,1296960," don't work for some period of time and just like live off of this money so there was an interesting"
1296960,1304880," moment in my life where uh i needed a job i was running out of money so and i couldn't find any freelance job"
1304880,1317280," so and um then i found yet again an office job right in nearby and that was so funny is that"
1318080,1325120," there is before they actually hire you there is how is it called in english so there is a period of time"
1325120,1332480," like a probing period uh right so where you're working for them but if they don't like background"
1332480,1339600," checks no it's like it's not into the probation yeah so basically uh so i went through probation"
1340240,1348560," and the salary from like it was i think two or three months or so the salary from this uh you know"
1348560,1353920," probation period was enough for me for half of a year because i'm a very frugal person and at the end"
1353920,1359200," of the probation they was they were about to say okay we're gonna hire you officially we really like how"
1359200,1366000," you performed and stuff like that and then i look at how much money i made and i said nah bye and it's just"
1366000,1375680," like in in half of a year i found freelance job so this is the kind of person i am right so"
1375680,1387600," so it's just like i for some reason if i have everything i just don't give a fuck and it's like"
1390080,1396160," maybe i'm just weird so maybe i don't do not uh rule out that uh but"
1396160,1400960," that's what i'm saying that it's just realizing how fucking ridiculous that is"
1400960,1404480," but that's who i am"
1404480,1413120," basically literally was a bus driver and a gut uh programmer at the same time oh yeah i heard that i"
1413120,1420000," heard that but i don't know like being a bus driver sounds like you actually need to do your job"
1420560,1426640," and just like i don't want to do any any job at all so uh so yeah"
1426640,1434560," so uh we have this thing uh let me actually cool on this entire stuff and"
1434560,1442320," so let me get clone and can do depth uh one"
1446080,1452880," so um usually the thing i like to do usually the thing i like to do i just like to evolve"
1452880,1458720," uh this stuff and so hair mode there we go"
1458720,1465680," easy peasy lemon squeezy thank you so much thank you so much whoever posted that in the chat i forgot who"
1465680,1473360," posted that but thank you uh right so you have to do expert right because the language was designed by"
1473360,1480000," javascript developers obviously you have to put export then you do void and then uh obviously it"
1480000,1482000," is equals right and"
1482000,1492640," okay i mean fair enough i press tab it indents it i press shift tap it unindents it i guess fair enough"
1492640,1494400," and also it uses stabs"
1494400,1507280," disgusting disgusting anyway so fmt uh so print lm and we're gonna do hello"
1507280,1516160," world so we've got this thing and do harry c can i just do i think you have to do build or something but i"
1516160,1522240," i mean i just want to try that uh okay so there's no semi yeah it's literally designed by javascript"
1522240,1523040," developers"
1523040,1535920," uh okay so type def variable is not set could not open module fmt that is bizarre minor fronder so"
1536640,1552800," that probably means that that probably means it didn't install some standard libraries i don't really"
1552800,1558320," know because if i take a look at the make file all right and what does it happen there so when you do"
1558320,1566560," installation it just installs it to the yeah i don't see any problems in that but i mean"
1566560,1571840," wait a second this is only i think i didn't finish yeah yeah"
1575680,1578800," yeah i compiled only bootstraps i forgot the second step"
1578800,1585520," all right so i mean it's hard okay it's hard i suggest"
1585520,1594400," so home where is the installation so i forgot the the third step right i already started compiling"
1594400,1597200," uh the build the driver source code okay"
1600240,1604480," so we have almost this entire thing build"
1604480,1612560," uh so we're not grab the git clone uh depth one depth one there we go"
1612560,1623920," uh use oh my god that's a way bigger thing so do you have make files it doesn't oh it does have a make"
1623920,1633280," file all right so and let's take a look at the read me uh i suppose you just do make right um so obtain"
1633280,1640000," the same thing you first have to copy the config right so let's go ahead and do that so copy uh"
1640000,1649360," config uh linux i suppose it is linux i just copy it to config mk and then i'm gonna do a make let's say go"
1649360,1654000," minor throw in the let's say go what the fuck is this"
1654000,1664560," uh sc doc not found very interesting so it was trying to compile some sc doc and whatnot and it"
1664560,1671440," couldn't do that and i wonder where it is uh so what is that so we probably um"
1673920,1684720," here um yeah but it didn't create anything in here so there's a higher doc and hurry everything okay"
1684720,1698080," um so maybe that that was weird honestly i want to try to run it one more time uh right just to see um"
1698960,1706400," so it's sc doc something that you have to install uh like system wide probably"
1706400,1713360," so let's actually see uh sc doc it's probably one of those things yeah it is okay so let's actually"
1713360,1724560," go ahead and install it uh so all right it seems to be installing think all right so if i do make one more"
1724560,1734160," time easy peasy lemon squeezy uh so um i suppose the thing we have to do we probably have to do check"
1734160,1743440," so let's do the check so that will run the tests so 275 tasks uh that is very interesting that is very"
1743440,1752240," interesting uh sc doc is also made by drew devolt uh also you mean hair is also made by drew devolt i don't"
1752240,1760480," really know so who made actually like hair oh a lot of passes i feel good about myself"
1760480,1767520," i feel really good about myself uh hair is made by drew okay so that that's interesting"
1767520,1779360," it's pretty cool um and so if we were to install this entire thing how it would even look like uh all right"
1779360,1786960," so let me let me take a look at the mic file and if you do install uh it just does install cmd right"
1786960,1796720," install cmd um and still cmd just installs uh the main pages right it's just the main pages uh here here"
1796720,1805280," a doc and it doesn't install any libraries or anything like that so that's what's weird about it so if i try"
1805280,1813680," to okay so let's install it locally and i'm gonna do dest dir uh and it's gonna be home opt hair all right"
1813680,1821440," so and let's just go ahead and install it um yeah so it just installs the the executable and nothing else"
1822880,1832720," right right so user local uh bean hair share main uh and src so okay here is the standard library all"
1832720,1838480," right all right all right all right so here is the standard library and i wonder if it's capable of"
1838480,1845520," finding the standard library after like like while being in that specific path or do i really have to"
1845520,1850880," install it system wide i have a feeling that i have to install system wide so but this some this is"
1850880,1858640," something that i can do i think uh right so i think this is something i can do so anyway uh let's go to"
1858640,1867840," here so it's going to probe here and uh so i can just do opt here i'm going to use this with this compile"
1868400,1875280," the compiler and that's just going to do uh so essentially you have to do the build you have to"
1875280,1881680," do the build rt module not found okay so you do need to actually do the installation like a system wide"
1881680,1888960," so we can do install and i'm going to just do cu uh like this and uh yeah so let's quickly do that"
1889920,1900080," all right so it is done uh and i suppose uh if i go to user uh local bean so here are all these things"
1900080,1908560," here see her dog and uh yeah so there's just here okay so there's a separately okay that's very interesting"
1910160,1923040," uh so uh are we ready to do this thing are we ready so what the was it doing exactly could cannot ignore"
1923040,1935680," error here tasks what was it doing okay what if i just do this okay so i have to do that"
1937760,1950160," uh so you have to so hello world hello world where is the hello world so i'm gonna take a look at the home"
1950160,1956400," you have to put exclamation mark at the end whatever the that means"
1956400,1960400," what is it doing for so long"
1964080,1966080," i'm assuming what"
1966080,1973600," i'm starting to get a little bit disappointed like what the is going on"
1973600,1985760," um so table of content um so getting started so oh all right so that is understandable uh right so"
1985760,1988480," oh hello"
1992480,1998080," and now it is fine that is bizarre command line interface like why"
1998080,2004800," if you didn't provide o file it was just doing some with oh this is because"
2004800,2009520," it's a folder and this is what confused it"
2009520,2012400," holy"
2016080,2025120," okay okay so busy uh all right so this is hello and this is hello world we can take a look at uh what"
2025120,2029520," is this file right so it is executable with debug information by the way"
2029520,2037840," with debug information which means that it can do gf2 on this thing and then break on main and just run it"
2038560,2047120," and i can't see it in the me so it says um like it's it's done isn't it right so"
2047120,2049680," yeah we can do next"
2049680,2056800," yeah it cannot show anything so this specific module cannot be found or whatever okay so it's"
2056800,2061840," not particularly useful and in terms of what it depends on it's not a dynamic executable"
2064320,2070240," it's not a time and i do appreciate that i actually do appreciate that"
2070240,2077760," absolutely based so does it use muscle i don't know maybe it just like uses its own like"
2077760,2083520," wrapper around linux cscos or something like that so yeah it's pretty cool"
2084640,2090480," by the way the tabs instead of spaces is also something drew likes or is that something that"
2090480,2098880," the developers of the extension for emacs like um so it's just like i don't know anyway so i would"
2098880,2103920," like to maybe create a separate folder because i want to try this stuff one more time and just do"
2104960,2113760," a hair build hello h a okay that was bizarre why it was not working"
2113760,2124480," there is some sort of a weird bug if you have a folder hair and you just try to do that it's still"
2128000,2135120," for some reason this is bizarre don't you think don't you think don't you think because if i move this"
2135120,2142720," thing in here and try to build it in here like that it says output path hair already exists but isn't an"
2142720,2153600," executable file right so but if i move this thing in here and just create an empty thing and do it's fine"
2153600,2165120," okay"
2165120,2176240," uh i also have folder i also have folder but i mean i didn't have that have had it before didn't i i think"
2176240,2182640," yeah i can remove it i can remove it actually and if i just do that yeah"
2183600,2195600," so it's kind of weird isn't it um so we can try to"
2195600,2204320," so maybe is there a hair yeah there is also nested here in there maybe you have to put like a nested"
2204320,2212640," here so i'm going to create a hair and then another hair right so we have two nested hairs as you can see"
2213280,2217280," uh and maybe that's what broke it no that's not what broke it"
2217280,2229920," it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't is it node i think it is uh in any case we managed to"
2229920,2235760," create hello world right so there is also a way to say run and it runs it right so everything is pretty"
2235760,2241040," good uh the compilation at the compilation time let's take a look at the compilation time yeah it's decent"
2241040,2246800," it could have been faster for such a small program but i mean it's decent uh if we run hello and check"
2246800,2252400," how fast it runs yeah so uh one millisecond is something that i would expect on my machine for hello"
2252400,2261520," world honestly maybe even less so that's basically on par with uh with c that's basically on par with c so"
2261520,2269840," so if you take a look at the python uh right so when you do print hello world uh how much time does it take"
2269840,2283520," to print this size time python python python three uh main pine right so it's 50 times 50 times slower"
2283520,2294160," all right 50 times slower anyways so uh maybe we need to learn about some interesting features of this"
2294160,2304480," language so uh function and parameters right so functions and parameters uh ask name blah blah blah"
2305200,2311760," so interestingly maybe i would like to take a look at the source code of hair like um at the modules all"
2311760,2317600," right so there's src hair and there's std so what kind of modules do we have in here so"
2317600,2324880," we learned about fmt so we do have fmt and you can do stuff in here uh so really like the extension of hair"
2324880,2348480," is just like uh so uh crypto you can mine crypto with this i'm joking by the way i know what is crypto um"
2348480,2360000," so there's a runtime os uh uuid all of that is boring all of that is boring there's a net uh so you"
2360000,2367760," can do ip tcp so you can write a like a network application so but can you create a window can you"
2367760,2376320," create a window so jai by the way one of the rare languages where part of the standard library is"
2377360,2388880," create a window and i think john has a pretty good point like why in 2024 in any language"
2388880,2395440," in any standard library of any language open a window is not a part of the standard library"
2395440,2404720," we had gui systems with windows for how much like for more than 30 years or something like"
2404720,2410960," that should be a thing in the standard library at this point because that's what you want to do"
2410960,2414880," quite often when you create an implication you want to open a window like duh"
2414880,2417200," fucking duh"
2417200,2425920," i don't know why this is not a thing right so and enjoy it is a thing by the way right so there's"
2425920,2432560," literally a module in enjoy create window and it just creates window in a cross-platform way"
2433760,2443200," in a cross-platform way um right and it comes with jay comes with jay uh so there's some tests and all"
2443200,2450880," of that is just kind of boring probably kind of boring how do you link with other libraries with"
2450880,2457680," c libraries and stuff like that how do you link does anybody know uh does documentation know memory"
2457680,2463760," the library management handling errors uh types and depth working with slices functions and depth modules"
2463760,2469360," uh how do i use libraries though how do i use libraries"
2469360,2477680," so is there something like ffi um maybe linking"
2479920,2492560," all right we're off to a great a great a start not gonna lie mind if we're gonna do so this is just"
2492560,2501120," hair documentation so there is a man hair so there are tutorials a general uh module tutorial okay reference"
2501120,2507520," documentation okay so maybe we want to have a reference documentation okay so this is the modules that you have"
2507520,2516720," and this is just like you know modules all right so uh extended support libraries here extended support"
2516720,2522960," libraries not on third party tools in here hair language specifications installation hair style developer"
2522960,2534640," resources okay um hair json support for hair all right so this is sort of like um separate thing"
2535280,2540560," and if you take a look at the source code uh actually we need to take a look at the tree of the source code"
2540560,2550880," okay so there's a make file and there is encoding in here so there is a json um and this is entirely written in that"
2550880,2553840," um"
2553840,2559920," hair extensions hair styles they got all the parts"
2560640,2568400," that's actually funny yeah i agree with that um so third party tools jdb so you can do gdb if you want"
2568400,2576160," to use gdb you can do that while grind and stuff like that how do i link with the c libraries does anybody"
2576160,2584720," know can i link with c libraries right so i have a library in c i would probably link it uh so there must be something"
2586240,2590880," there must be something uh so general"
2590880,2599920," linking so in the tutorial there is nothing in the tutorial there is nothing in a standard library"
2599920,2610480," uh linking linking there is nothing uh so maybe i can just google up uh oh so yeah there was a hair build lc"
2611360,2616480," oh that's a good one okay so maybe we can work with that actually maybe we can work with that"
2616480,2625360," um so where is the hello and if we take a look at the hair like help is that something i can do or"
2625360,2640880," or maybe minus h so uh um um maybe in the build aha so it is literally just like uh in gcc i'm gonna sneeze by the way"
2640880,2643440," okay"
2648480,2660080," so i'm thinking so i remember seeing something like minus l but i think i lost it so hair minus lc but"
2660080,2664960," i'm gonna put it into the quotes and i'm gonna just do something like this i wonder if google will find"
2664960,2676560," that uh of course google will not find that uh hair programming programming language google is kind of useless"
2676560,2685040," lately and it's like there was mentioning of oh my god that's so bad show go away okay"
2685040,2695760," uh sure like it it cannot find them okay so i lost that thing um so the problem is i can probably link"
2695760,2701920," with some stuff right so let's actually try to link with uh raylib and see what we can do uh with raylib"
2701920,2710720," specifically so it's going to be raylib uh ready five so it's somewhere in the build somewhere in the build"
2710720,2719440," so yeah here it is so we're going to do that uh and i can just go ahead and try to build hello.h"
2719440,2724160," and l raylib right will it work um i actually don't"
2726000,2730080," what what do you want exactly what's the error"
2730080,2744880," like at least give a few words describing what the do you want i see so it doesn't like the order but"
2744880,2751200," give a few words jesus oh i'm sorry um"
2752960,2758560," like at least explain like what exactly you don't like uh it's like okay so it linked it together so"
2758560,2764560," that's already cool uh that's already cool but the question is like how can i use this kind of thing"
2765120,2775280," how can i use this kind of thing so because um how right um so there was a tutorial getting started"
2775280,2778640," uh build editor plugging"
2778640,2781440," higher basic"
2781440,2788240," all right so i think i want to make a small break you know what i think i want to make a small break"
2789040,2794480," and i want to refill my cup of tea and after the small break we're going to try to find how you"
2794480,2801360," declare a function so you can use it from the linked library right so i think that's kind of important"
2801360,2808960," because by itself the standard library of hair is meh there's nothing particularly interesting in there"
2808960,2815600," right so there's nothing really interesting in there so it's just the standard library input output math"
2816320,2823360," network it's like almost like we're in 70s have you noticed that in all of the even modern languages"
2823360,2827440," the standard library assumes that we are in 70s"
2827440,2834080," that's what's weird about all the languages like why do i assume that you are in 70s"
2834080,2839600," we have web we have window in system we have gpu accelerated it's just like"
2840400,2848480," what uh what do you mean have you seen standard libraries of programming languages my friends"
2848480,2855280," like i mean if you don't understand what what i mean you probably never programmed"
2855280,2858880," just have you seen programming languages like what what kind of question is that"
2858880,2867280," anyway so uh let's make a small break and um all right so on the break people suggested me this link"
2867280,2875040," uh right which is very very cool uh so essentially this is how you link with uh c libraries so you"
2875040,2883840," export malloc but this is not what we want to do we want to import it uh yeah we want to import it so"
2883840,2890720," this is probably how we do that right so there is a external function that accepts certain types and we"
2890720,2898400," associate it with a certain symbol um and there is an opaque type so i suppose opaque uh pointer is just"
2898400,2904240," like a void star right so that's what it is so maybe this is the syntax that we have to use uh so and this"
2904240,2911360," is what we can try essentially but in this case i want to actually do like init window right so i want to"
2911360,2919040," do init window uh and in here so let's actually literally call it init window but the problem here"
2919040,2927680," is that we have to accept two integers right so this is size and size and then a const char star and i'm"
2927680,2934240," not sure if that's something that you can just do syntactically in here uh right it's probably not going to"
2934240,2942320," work so let me actually try that uh let me actually try that and we can even try to like init uh window"
2942320,2949120," right so we can meet window 800 by 600 and here title like definitely this is not how it works"
2949120,2956080," definitely this is not how it works but we can try that and uh what does it say uh right so you can't"
2956080,2963840," just do that so here you can maybe probably do something like this uh right unresolve will identify"
2963840,2971440," character is there something like you ate maybe uh right so this is not how it works it would be"
2971440,2981680," great if there was a section on like ffi with c like i'm telling you if there was a section on ffi in c"
2981680,2988880," that would have been kind of great but maybe we can actually look at the runtime uh right look at the"
2988880,3000240," runtime and maybe find a lot of interesting examples right so we can go to opt uh here user local src uh"
3000240,3010720," rt so here it is and we can literally search for the symbol right or n and just like find different"
3010720,3016480," interesting symbols uh what kind of interesting symbols uh what kind of interesting symbols can we have"
3016480,3029120," uh so you need to main uh uh all right so this one is cool so this looks like exactly what i tried to do"
3029120,3037280," i think uh so we export in this as a c yeah yeah i see i see i see i see so and i have a feeling that"
3037280,3044080," that this is exactly what we have to sort of accept but it didn't really work right maybe because i was"
3044080,3050080," trying to do it like that so if i try to do it yeah there we go so it kind of works but then if i try to"
3050080,3055120," do it like this you cannot pass like argument type string is not assignable to parameter point to start"
3055840,3065440," right right so you need to turn this string into c string right so this is what you need to do you need"
3065440,3067360," to turn it into c string"
3067360,3077120," yeah c string so the question is how can you do that um"
3079600,3088160," so if we take a look at the documentation so reference documentation uh rt"
3088160,3097760," yeah it's just it's the same as reading the source code honestly right c string so there's something"
3097760,3104560," strlen do do you do you have anything as a sterling so we can even try to do the following thing i'm gonna"
3104560,3111920," grab for strlen because that's where probably uh okay so there is"
3111920,3117760," oh so there is a type like type"
3117760,3126560," that is poggers believe it or not right so that is kind of poggers uh right because you can have types"
3127120,3137360," and there's a classes uh-huh so i'm gonna go to hello and i'm gonna use type but it's kind of weird"
3137360,3145280," so is it going to compile if i just do it like that uh type c is that what you want uh maybe maybe"
3145280,3151440," you have to do it like that module c not fun that's bizarre honestly wait wait wait it's types"
3152160,3161200," types excuse me excuse me yeah there we go uh so and if i try to compile so that got recognized as the"
3161200,3170880," type um so and we have strings so we can do st okay okay okay okay we compute the length this is perfect"
3172320,3181680," this is perfect so to str unsafe to str and all right all right all right all right all right to str so"
3181680,3190640," you can convert from c string to the string of hair but is there some way to do the opposite thing from"
3190640,3199920," okay okay we actually figured it out so i can literally do uh from str and apparently apparently i can"
3199920,3207440," literally just do char i can literally just do char but here i probably have to do something like"
3207440,3215200," types uh c right because that's where it is located right so type c maybe even strings uh right so we'll"
3215200,3221200," see how we can figure that out so i and by the way i know nothing about syntax of hair i'm seeing this"
3221200,3228960," language for this language for the first time i'm literally guessing it's right so not sure if it's a"
3228960,3236320," good idea generally but i mean it may work if you if you just like uh bang your hand against the wall for"
3236320,3246800," long enough it may actually work um so what i'm thinking is that maybe um uh do you have char defined"
3246800,3255280," anywhere i want that right because i'm pretty sure that char is an alias right so you can probably have"
3255280,3264160," something like char um right and maybe it is more like a type right so it's more like a type char yeah"
3264160,3280240," yeah there we go so yeah so what i'm thinking is that um if i go here can i do user um where was that"
3280240,3293040," uh so type types c char can i do shit like that uh so by the way what the fuck am i doing in here so i'm not supposed to do it like that so it's not"
3293040,3302640," uh particularly useful so now let me try to build a c module not found so but if i try to do something"
3302640,3310640," like this uh-huh so what if i say c holy i figured it out holy fuck okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay"
3310640,3321520," so init window uh 800 by 600 so then c from str hello from hair"
3323040,3332640," now um"
3332640,3336640," now m"
3344640,3345200," i'm sorry"
3345200,3355520," all right i literally brute force this shit who needs the community guys"
3355520,3361680," i'm fucking telling you source code is the best community i didn't read any all these stinky"
3361680,3364320," tutorials i just grabbed the standard library"
3366320,3375920," just by gripping standard library i figured out how to you know call this thing"
3375920,3385520," um"
3385520,3394400," so thank you so much static static zc6 uh with the message banging my head against the wall usually"
3394400,3397520," solves my coding problem after some time as well yeah"
3399520,3409120," you sue you sue you sue um so it's more like um investigative programming if you know what i mean if that makes"
3409120,3416000," any sense so essentially um i needed to work with c"
3416000,3428240," strings so how did i approach that um so i assumed that maybe in the standard library there are some bindings for"
3428240,3434080," some uh you know functions from c library and i start gripping that"
3434080,3436560," and that's why i start gripping uh str len"
3436560,3437520," because"
3437520,3438480," if"
3438480,3444800," there is anywhere a code that does conversion between hair strings and c strings"
3444800,3450320," it's probably somewhere in ellipse bindings and probably with the function str len"
3451520,3456080," and i found this function and it in fact contained the signature it contained the type"
3456080,3462160," it contained an example on how to accept uh you know c strings and i went from there"
3462160,3468480," i actually went from there right so you basically you still need to have a little bit of experience in"
3468480,3473440," software development to pull that off right but once you have that a little bit you can basically"
3474240,3480160," come up with the hypothesis like where what to find and what to grab and just grab and find that thing"
3480160,3486240," all right and then use that as an example and so on and so forth uh right"
3489600,3494000," so now we need to close the window so and i suppose closing the window"
3494000,3498400," right and i suppose you can actually cool uh like call it differently"
3500640,3501200," finally"
3501200,3503840," fucking finally"
3503840,3506080," haha"
3506080,3514880," eat that ray san i don't have to follow your style anymore i don't have to follow that"
3514880,3521840," hell yeah brother okay"
3525920,3532880," if there is any reason for me to switch to hair that would be it that would be a good reason to switch"
3532880,3541840," oh add the module how can i have a module yeah yeah so then i can do uh array leap"
3541840,3546720," finally holy i've been waiting for that for so long"
3546720,3554800," uh oh yeah i could do that i could do that but i mean it's it's uh using the the pre-process and stuff"
3554800,3556880," like that for the month yeah"
3556880,3565120," so how can i by the way do that that's a good question actually um so maybe for that i'll need"
3565120,3575360," some documentation but maybe not actually maybe not because you have types in there i suppose module"
3576160,3587680," is literally like a separate type so let's create ray uh lib ha ray lib ha and uh move all these things"
3587680,3593760," in there so then i can use array lib uh and i wonder if i have to make them pop i probably have"
3593760,3598960," to export them right because obviously as you can see this language is designed by javascript developers"
3598960,3602560," right obviously so you have to do something like expert"
3602560,3610960," uh finally finally good style convention good style convention"
3610960,3614560," uh so we probably also need to"
3614560,3621920," we can maybe even write some wrappers around all of that stuff i'm pretty sure so we can"
3622720,3628640," do this kind of thing for you and obviously like let's just look like that um so i'm going to"
3628640,3633200," just put it like this and let's try to build it"
3633200,3641920," okay role uh module ray leap is not found okay so let's go ahead and just see"
3643520,3650480," where you update the search path so add library to link your path okay that's understandable um so"
3650480,3655040," is there something over writing space for the module that"
3655040,3664240," do i literally have to include ray lib ha"
3664240,3672400," no not like this um that's bizarre it doesn't even tell me what it doesn't like"
3673280,3680320," right it just tells me that it has to be a single uh single thing uh has to be a directory"
3680320,3690080," according to the documentation really uh and can i move it in here then"
3690080,3702960," okay so expected found uh all right so there were types but do you have"
3703040,3710480," symbol okay so maybe i have to move expert in front in here so we're just gonna"
3710480,3719040," fuck around and find out yeah that was it actually that was actually it that is absolutely freaking"
3719040,3727040," poggers i suppose right it has to be like a um separate folder and it compiled as you can see so"
3727040,3732720," uh i can actually now can i run yeah there we go so that worked correctly as you can see we have"
3732720,3740000," the log from the log from ray leap and one of the things we can do in ray leap in fact we can have a"
3740000,3746960," separate symbol which is like the original style but then uh we don't have to export it right so we"
3746960,3754800," don't have to export it at all and the thing we can export uh is going to accept like a proper"
3754880,3757440," uh string"
3757440,3774640," so this one by the way they do not return anything i don't know why i said that the return something they"
3774640,3784400," do not return anything uh and in here we can just call to init window width height title c"
3785040,3794080," from uh str like so so and if i try to rebuild this entire thing so what do you have so we're supposed to"
3794080,3811840," to return uh uh uh so uh void okay so that's what you want uh uh uh what else i'll probably have"
3811840,3823760," to explicitly say that they return void sure okay so now here i can just provide something like this and that worked i wonder if i can see the title it doesn't log the title unfortunately"
3823760,3830400," right so it doesn't log the title anyway so the next thing is going to be uh symbol"
3830400,3841200," uh so how we gonna call that how we're gonna call that uh window uh should close should close"
3841200,3850960," uh window should close and it's going to return boolean i suppose right so i suppose this is enough and then"
3850960,3861040," uh while shit four okay so it has opinionated thing on on loops"
3861040,3867360," oh boy i love opinionated languages i love opinionated languages okay so let's see"
3868880,3876240," uh here uh here general language introduction and maybe there's loops for loops"
3876240,3881600," uh so yeah yeah it is like okay okay"
3881600,3887600," yeah yeah it's a go style all right all right all right all right uh and i suppose you also have"
3887600,3897120," to wrap it in parentheses ray leap uh window should close window should close and while we're just doing"
3897120,3903360," that uh i suppose one of the things we have to constantly do is ray leap to be fair i think i"
3903360,3907840," understand the point of race and having these prefixes kind of sucks honestly"
3908880,3916560," anyway uh so begin drawing uh begin drawing uh begin drawing and then end drawing right so uh we can have"
3916560,3927040," something like that uh so this is begin drawing and then begin drawing then"
3928960,3937280," and drawing and drawing and drawing so in this case these things are voids voids so ready did i not"
3937280,3943840," export those things uh-huh way seriously"
3946880,3967440," no fucking way you have to put sem i mean okay sure"
3967440,3972560," easy peasy hello from here mother flippers"
3976320,3980000," easy peasy you can write games in these tries"
3980000,3983040," ray leap speed"
3983040,3988480," this is such a cool idea"
3988480,3998480," take a language that you never programmed before and try to run ray leap on it as quickly as possible"
3998480,4004720," feels like c with extra steps i mean you have modules do you have modules in c"
4005760,4013120," ee ee ee does your little silly c have modules i don't fucking think so"
4013120,4020160," dab dab dab already better than c already so and i wonder how"
4020160,4024000," more other things it actually implements so that's a very interesting question"
4027280,4043280," uh so maybe we could find some cool constructions right so error handling um so const and let defined"
4043280,4050000," variables function and parameters uh all right nothing particularly interesting right i didn't see"
4050000,4057040," anything particularly interesting um const and let right so you have const variables you have let variables i suppose"
4057280,4066000," const const are constant let are you know modifiable mutable but maybe not uh so um this is a sample"
4066000,4071840," it does feel like a javascript so a lot of stuff was actually inspired by javascript uh does interest"
4071840,4076880," a few common ways to use variables in here with constant let when declaring variable you must provide initial"
4076880,4083200," value initializer such as constant a variable declared with const cannot be modified later but you can modify let variables okay"
4084160,4090160," uh right right nothing particularly special nothing interesting so there are arrays and slices i know the"
4090160,4099200," concept of array and slices so i didn't think so um may infer length from the context blah blah blah nothing"
4099200,4105520," interesting memory management stack allocation pass by reference dynamic memory allocations and defer so you can"
4105520,4112320," you can just unlock some size and you can even work with that in that way but then how can you convert that"
4112320,4122640," into an array of integers so that's very interesting um so you have args so this is just a point right so but then if"
4122640,4135520," i want to allocate array um so this is how you allocate array right it's just it will infer the size and how to allocate okay okay so and then you can do defer to to delegate that's already"
4135520,4141520," actually actually kind of cool that's already better than c uh right so i can use that instead of c just for"
4141520,4150400," the modules and defer so one of the things that like c really really lacks right some sort of namespaces"
4150400,4161040," uh what the is that a log i have no idea honestly so like the way i usually approach this kind of is just like"
4162320,4169840," i kind of make a note that there is a syntax like that and i do not pay much attention to that to the"
4169840,4176960," specific and what that means so obviously it is some sort of an allocation and it's some sort of allocation"
4176960,4184080," that allocates this thing like what is that i don't know maybe it says that uh it needs to be initialized"
4184080,4190240," with zeros and it doesn't have the right end so that means it will just use the size of this thing from the"
4190240,4195200," type maybe it means something else but the point is this is how you allocate arrays"
4195200,4202400," so the details can be figured out later when i actually try to use all of that"
4202400,4209120," honestly so and that's why people quite often like criticize me that oh you skip the commentations"
4209120,4215040," so fast but i do that on purpose because i just skip unimportant details this feels to me like"
4215040,4220320," an important detail and it just probably doesn't really matter what that means honestly like if you"
4220320,4225840," think about it who cares what that means that's how you allocate a rate end of the story move on let's"
4225840,4230800," actually find something actually interesting so it's just like all these languages they they have opinion"
4230800,4237200," on how to provide certain things with a certain syntax okay let them do their thing let them cook or"
4237200,4243840," whatever it's just whatever um so that's basically what it is like i don't know what it means either"
4243840,4250480," and it doesn't matter and i don't even care like i don't even care i've seen so many of these goddamn"
4250480,4255840," languages you won't believe and all of them are trying to be unique and quirky and weird where you're"
4255840,4262480," special yeah yeah yeah you you are all the same in your attempt to look special i know that uh so"
4262480,4266800," hand and errors are actually really interesting so maybe it has an interesting good take on hand and errors"
4266800,4275440," because uh i remember like like they put uh exclamation mark at the end of the print for whatever"
4275440,4282240," fucking reason right so it was that maybe it has something to do with errors uh okay so it's just a"
4282240,4290960," switch cases all right okay so some switch cases and okay so exclamation mark operator uh in prior"
4290960,4296320," example with operator which causes the program to crash when an error occurs let's explore some more"
4296320,4301520," effective ways to deal with errors so program use oh it's great this is actually kind of cool area like"
4301520,4310160," this um so handing errors with match so essentially if you don't care about handling an error you just crash"
4310160,4316160," it would be kind of cool if it had something similar to question mark from rust where it just like uh you"
4316160,4323120," know short circuits the the execution of the current uh procedure and just goes up so that will be actually"
4323120,4332320," kind of cool uh so and why we're handling this errors is with uh which you already know how to use more"
4332320,4340800," ethical ways to use match a match expression takes okay so you either use match or you crash just match"
4340800,4349040," or crash all right right okay so there is a there is a question holy so is the cumbersome match to"
4349040,4353360," enumerate every possible failure to every function to make it easier to deal with errors question mark is"
4353360,4362640," general use the purpose is to check for errors and if found there you go there you go thank you very much"
4362640,4363440," okay so that"
4363440,4373600," you got me interested in mother flipper there you got me okay okay okay okay okay okay so that's like rust"
4373600,4379520," without exactly yo imagine rust but without the bullshit"
4379520,4385360," so it's more like zeke then zeke also has a fair amount of"
4385360,4387600," bullshit trust me i've tried this language so"
4394880,4399280," so that that that's that's good i like that i like that i like that i like that so"
4399280,4402160," huh"
4402160,4406480," all right all right all right all right"
4406480,4417520," so um let's maybe clear the screen um so does it have any other interesting"
4417520,4423680," stuff so there is a control flow never type so it probably never quits right so it's probably not"
4423680,4428560," interesting types in depth promotion and type inference casting type assertions user defined"
4428560,4434240," types um it's a little bit interesting but not that much honestly uh tagged unions okay so how"
4434240,4439520," do you okay so this is a tagged union that's very cool uh so what the is that"
4439520,4446160," so it's more of a like a collection oh you you sort of spread it it's a spread"
4446160,4450960," why there's so many javascript references"
4452880,4459120," this is obscene the amount of javascript references is obscene this is supposed to be like a c like"
4459120,4466880," language disgusting yeah yeah exactly this is the ultimate combination of javascript plus c plus rust"
4466880,4472560," by the way don't get me wrong i'm actually like it so far right so uh i'm not dissing this language"
4472560,4477360," or anything like that i'm just trying to be entertaining if you know what i mean right"
4479760,4485760," i'm not against this language so far i'm not against it like it's just like okay all of"
4485760,4489760," that makes sense all of that is reasonable okay okay okay um"
4489760,4502640," okay so that's cool so tagged unions growable slices dynamics okay so growable slices so this is the slice"
4503440,4511440," strings for all the lines how do i append shy oh it's just append okay but then i can i free this thing"
4511440,4519920," okay so you're free okay it's in terms of the memory management it's like go without garbage collector"
4519920,4529840," but since it has deferred it is easier to manage than c right it is more comfortable than c but less"
4529840,4536960," comfortable than go but without garbage collector right so to be fair if c had deferred memory"
4536960,4543920," management in c would have become magnitudes easier honestly magnitudes easier it wouldn't be like on the"
4543920,4552560," level of having garbage collector but it would be easier at least so okay so so far so good so far so good"
4553520,4560880," so static slice separation slice assignment nothing interesting functions and depths uh oh init f in need"
4560880,4561520," it's like um"
4561520,4573200," aha it's a elf stuff isn't it yeah in elf modules in elf objects there's always function in it and f in it"
4573200,4578720," this is the function is called that module is initialized and this one is called when module is"
4578720,4585760," de-initialized right so yeah so okay i think the first time i saw something like that in pascal i"
4585760,4590480," think pascal had something like that it had the initialization section for a module and the initialization"
4590480,4597360," section module so all right all right organizing your code in many files so"
4600480,4607200," all right"
4607200,4612800," i would give it eight out of ten um i'll give it eight out of ten all right so let's actually continue"
4612800,4622800," the example and let's try to clear uh background clear background uh so here we probably have to"
4623520,4635280," define uh define uh define structure and define structure so reference here tutorial general language"
4635280,4645440," introduction uh how can i have structures and struct types and tuples okay so can i define something like"
4645440,4654320," i probably have to do expert type uh color right so we've got colors um and oh so you have to"
4654320,4658480," type struct"
4658480,4669680," and we have to do r and i wonder if i can just do yeah okay g b a rgba and then like this how do i"
4669680,4674000," construct this thing i probably can yeah okay so that makes sense that makes a lot of sense"
4675760,4682800," so uh in a clear background we uh accept the cola so here is the color and"
4682800,4689040," ray leap clear back around"
4689040,4693120," so ray leap cola"
4693120,4700320," and in here what we can do so yeah we just do"
4701520,4717120," r 255 g b a 255 something like this and i wonder if i can just do something like const red"
4717120,4721040," if you know what i mean"
4723520,4725680," uh it doesn't work on the selection"
4725680,4736400," this emacs extension is kind of mid i'm not gonna lie it is kind of need"
4736400,4739200," so and in here we can just do red"
4747760,4750800," no clitoral yeah because you don't need it you don't really need it"
4750800,4757680," okay"
4757680,4764720," so do you have"
4764720,4767760," hexadecimal literals"
4769520,4774800," so because i know that in ray leap you have a function a very interesting function called"
4774800,4778880," get caller all right so and this is get"
4778880,4786320," caller we can just call it get caller and the caller is just an integer right so we can do it like that"
4787120,4790560," so then uh i can do something like ray leap"
4790560,4793760," get caller uh and x"
4793760,4798320," 80 80 80 ff all right so then i don't have to have a red"
4798320,4802400," or anything like that so it didn't like"
4802400,4808400," uh type boolean is not possible so uh i have to return actually cola"
4809200,4810800," so it's going to be called a structure"
4810800,4814160," yep it worked"
4814160,4820560," does it have transmute though that's a very interesting question"
4820560,4824080," um we could try actually do that"
4824080,4833200," so we're going to have c u32 right so we can do something like that and then i can assign this"
4833200,4838720," as a pointer to c is that something possible within the language so let's just do build"
4839920,4845680," okay that is in fact possible how do you do costs uh cast casting"
4845680,4854000," uh so you do as so then we can do as ray leap uh caller right and we actually want to do it like"
4854000,4861680," a pointer so is that something that is uh expected attack union type or a nullable pointer"
4861680,4867600," uh so it's not that easy to do right so maybe i have to"
4868560,4875760," just do it like that so that didn't work uh okay so"
4875760,4878160," aha"
4878160,4883120," okay"
4883120,4891760," so we you can do as only with uh tagged unions i suppose"
4897280,4905040," beautiful when you know the tagged union so i suppose it's not that easy so maybe it's not allowed"
4905040,4909920," by default cannot be null in other words yeah"
4909920,4918000," maybe maybe you do type punning through different means so maybe you just don't do that because it's"
4918000,4923680," actually kind of unsafe it's a very unsafe operation there is a reason why in rust it is unsafe so"
4923680,4931920," maybe it's totally fine but it is not like that that it is not like that so uh let's draw a rectangle i"
4931920,4939600," suppose uh very deep by the way can i just import everything from here is that something i can do"
4940080,4944400," um all right um all right so we can take a look at the modules modules"
4944400,4954080," um modules"
4959040,4964800," it's like import maybe there is no way to is there something like using"
4964800,4969360," uh so what is yield"
4969360,4973120," um"
4973120,4978640," to note blocks expression which are related after another in many languages this decoration"
4979360,4982560," semantic means this introduce new compound expression and it's like"
4982560,4987440," yield"
4987440,4997280," so you basically return f from the match"
5002320,5003200," that's very interesting"
5003200,5010560," that's very interesting so you just check for an error in here and if there was no error"
5010560,5018000," right if the type that was returned out of here is size you just yield that size otherwise you print an error"
5018000,5021040," that is very interesting"
5024080,5025840," can you can you union"
5025840,5033920," the color struct as the expected type but they're called tagged unions so that means there is an extra"
5033920,5039840," runtime information to distinguish them because there is an is operator so how is operator knows which type"
5039840,5048480," it is at runtime so i feel like um i think it's not how it works right i don't think it's how it works"
5050560,5052160," anyways whatever"
5052160,5057280," so unknown object so let's do it like that"
5057280,5068800," so let's draw a rectangle draw a rectangle and um"
5068800,5075360," we can actually do some interesting stuff can i do background"
5080560,5086160," draw a rectangle is going to be 0 0 100 100 and the color is going to be red"
5086160,5090480," and we can denote red uh like this"
5090480,5095520," uh so this is going to be red"
5095520,5098240," um though"
5098240,5100000," yeah i think"
5100000,5106320," it should be pretty straightforward to draw the rectangle uh draw rectangle"
5109680,5113200," uh"
5113200,5114400," so we can do int int"
5114400,5126160," int uh i suppose width height and the color like so so that is basically it"
5126160,5134800," uh-huh enable okay so you can't do uh non-constant computations for the const i wonder if you can just do let"
5136240,5136960," uh uh-huh"
5136960,5141920," initialize at compile time really"
5141920,5150800," you can't do initialize at compile time well i mean it's a runtime value isn't it"
5150800,5157040," um argument i const is not assignable"
5159360,5160560," to int parameter"
5160560,5160560," to int parameter"
5160560,5163120," what"
5163120,5167440," is that because of red"
5167440,5170720," unknown"
5170720,5172880," uh"
5172880,5172880," uh"
5172880,5178560," draw rectangle did i draw okay"
5184240,5188400," unknown object read okay so that was fine but what the fuck is this shit"
5188400,5191280," argument"
5191280,5203760," am i am i going crazy like why red maybe color red"
5205920,5207600," why background works"
5207600,5210080," oh"
5210080,5217440," okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay everyone relax everyone relax i know what's the problem"
5217440,5218240," you said it too"
5219120,5224000," yeah yeah everyone relax everything's fine so this is going to be red"
5224000,5226080," uh boom"
5226080,5227280," yo"
5227280,5233600," run there we go here is the rectangle here is the rectangle look at that"
5233600,5241520," look at that so now we can try to control this chassis somehow uh so we need to have like a key up and"
5241520,5248160," key down or anything like that um so we can do is key pressed"
5248160,5250080," symbol"
5250080,5252080," is"
5252080,5252560," key"
5252560,5252960," down"
5252960,5255920," and here we have is key"
5255920,5256960," down"
5256960,5258560," x"
5258560,5262320," oh maybe just key and it's going to be an integer right i suppose it returns a boolean"
5262320,5265040," and then here"
5265040,5267040," if"
5267040,5267600," um"
5267600,5268880," ray leap"
5268880,5271040," so i suppose maybe you also wrap it like this"
5271040,5272400," is key down"
5272400,5274800," can i do something like"
5274800,5276080," you know d"
5276080,5279040," and basically keep moving"
5279040,5283200," this thing to the right so we'll also have to allocate the"
5283200,5286560," position of this thing so it has to be x"
5286560,5289520," uh do we have float f32 yeah so it's f32"
5289520,5292240," um so and also y"
5292240,5294080," x32"
5294080,5298640," so we're going to be using x and y right so x and y in here and if you press d"
5299280,5299920," we can do"
5299920,5302160," we can do basically x plus"
5302160,5310800," uh some sort of a speed multiplied by get frame time actually really uh get frame time"
5310800,5316160," so something like this right so we can have something like this so that will allow us to move"
5316160,5320560," in a certain direction so you you also have to put semicolon in here"
5321120,5325280," um right so um right so it's not assignable to binding initializer"
5325280,5331520," is not assignable to binding type so you want to have something like this"
5331520,5339440," all right so that makes sense so we don't have a get frame time so we can add it that's not a big deal"
5340240,5346080," so get frame time get frame frame frame time there we go"
5346080,5353600," and i'm gonna do compile so what else do we have in here uh it's supposed to actually return float"
5353600,5360960," what else do we have so can i do as um integer in here as integer"
5367200,5376480," and of course there is a very specific anal way of converting floats to integers and it's not obvious"
5376480,5378720," you have to lose the documentation"
5378720,5386080," that's what i like about learning these new languages yeah so"
5386080,5392080," we're trying to be super safe and unusual it's just like go find out how you convert float to an integer"
5394000,5402160," okay so um let me see let me see conversion conversion convert"
5402160,5403840," uh"
5403840,5419200," casting between okay that's how you do casting casting between numeric types allows for lucy conversions okay"
5419920,5428400," lucy juicy lucy juicy lucy conversion there we go i figured it out boom it did it didn't work okay"
5428400,5432800," so that's very interesting so i suppose this one has to be capitalized"
5432800,5442320," i can only dab with one head because left hand actually holding d but now i can dab with two hands"
5444720,5449920," it's not epic easy peasy lemon squeezy chat where are the poggers in the chat"
5449920,5456160," um can i use the oh yeah so that's that's a good question can i transmute this now"
5456160,5466160," uh so essentially i'm gonna do uh c and this is gonna be like this we can say it's a u32"
5466800,5475680," uh then we take a pointer which is just a pointer to see but then i say bruh a ray leap cola ray leap cola"
5475680,5479040," uh yep yep yep yep"
5479040,5488480," i i looks like i can transmute this okay so i'm gonna make it green specifically right i'm gonna make it"
5488480,5497040," green specifically and then i'm gonna draw the rectangle i'm gonna draw the can yeah you can see with this thing"
5497040,5500400," how do i dereference"
5500400,5504720," dereference"
5507680,5510240," uh with the or dot operator"
5510240,5514640," uh so there is a auto dereferencing"
5514640,5524640," why didn't you okay so it complains actually in here it doesn't it okay maybe"
5524640,5532160," do i have to wrap all of that like this"
5534320,5536000," it can't recognize this"
5536000,5539840," it can't recognize this"
5539840,5546640," expected number end of the file so you yeah"
5546640,5549360," but i wonder"
5549360,5552880," okay i have p and then it can say"
5552880,5556320," um b p"
5556320,5558560," ray leap wait"
5558560,5562800," yeah so it was fine actually it was fine"
5564000,5566720," all right so wait so it still complains"
5566720,5570640," what"
5570640,5573360," what"
5573360,5576080," okay so i'm"
5576080,5579040," where did i do a fucky wacky i put some"
5579040,5581600," bullshit somewhere and it doesn't show me where i made him"
5581600,5589680," oh my god the parser sucks the parser sucks i'm telling you it sucks it wasted my time"
5591360,5594480," i'm sorry i'm sorry the language is cool parser sucks"
5594480,5602560," it wasted my time i'm telling you mate it wasted my time all right so what do we have in here"
5603040,5606720," um what do you want from me what do you want from me what do you want from me so it wants yeah"
5606720,5609920," bruv bruv bruv bruv so"
5609920,5614560," uh now let's try to do that ray leap cola"
5614560,5620320," uh-huh color is not a silo okay"
5621760,5622800," yeah i can do transmit"
5622800,5622800," yeah i can do transmit"
5622800,5626960," type punning so you can literally do type punning so that's that's cool"
5626960,5631360," uh so that's pretty cool so that's how you do type"
5631360,5645200," that's pretty poise that's pretty poise"
5645200,5654880," all right so how about the rest of the directions so i guess think what do you guys think so the time has"
5654880,5661200," come for more directions so we're going to do a and this one actually moves to the to the left so i can do"
5666800,5673600," so maybe we can factor out the speed speed a violence momentum"
5673600,5682000," speed violence divorce uh so how do you do that okay so speed"
5682000,5689120," uh and we can do f32 let's say it's going to be something like this"
5690560,5694960," uh yeah that's much faster look at that look at that try see cool cool cool"
5694960,5703600," now i'm going to do w and w is up so that means it's going to be like this and"
5703600,5711600," s is going to be just plus so we are moving in all of the mother flipping directions"
5711600,5716000," we're moving in all of the mother flipping directions however we"
5716000,5722560," fucking want however we want isn't that epic i think it's pretty freaking epic holy"
5722560,5729520," by the way can i just nuke uh this and just do something like this can i do that"
5729520,5735840," holy i can so that means i don't have to do that like that so it's already better than go i'm telling"
5735840,5742160," you right in go you are obligated to have these things in here you are not obligated to do that already"
5742160,5747680," better than go already better than go i'm telling you bro bro bro bro i'm telling you so"
5747680,5751360," we need to figure out how to get rid of the prefixes so"
5751360,5758800," ray san has a point uh ray san has a point how can i just do something like this does anybody know"
5758800,5764560," uh does anybody know how i can just do that so it's obviously not going to compile but"
5764560,5769600," uh and i can try to do that and that doesn't matter oh it works what the"
5771520,5776320," okay didn't i tried wait wait wait wait didn't i try that and it didn't work"
5776320,5781360," i'm pretty sure i fucking tried that and it didn't work"
5781360,5785200," okay whatever so"
5785200,5790000," uh if i'm going to remove the prefixes later ah okay i see"
5794400,5804320," happens every time i wonder if i can put constant here by the way i can but i can't put const in here"
5804320,5806480," because you yeah"
5806480,5813280," so what if i well whatever yeah that's fine"
5815200,5824880," uh so we can maybe add something interesting i don't know um can you mark a get color as const that's"
5824880,5827680," a good question so is there something like a const fn"
5827680,5833680," uh i i don't really see const offense on this line const fn"
5835840,5845920," um so yeah i'm not sure uh this guy has closures i'm pretty sure it does closure uh lambda so there"
5845920,5852720," is a function pointers at least right so there are function pointers uh but is there anonymous so"
5852720,5858800," they're also called unknown i didn't see actually honestly it feels like maybe there is no anonymous"
5858800,5864240," functions"
5864240,5873360," looks like all of the functional programmer developers are mad all five of them all five of the functional"
5873360,5878800," programmers are mad there's no anonymous"
5878800,5881040," um"
5881040,5885360," huh"
5885360,5888960," ray leap"
5888960,5889520," huh"
5889520,5899760," is this better than react it is better than your mom not only react"
5903040,5909120," uh so for how long were you streaming uh so yeah"
5909120,5916400," i guess i'm gonna i'm gonna call today right so i'm registering for two hours i'm registering for two"
5916400,5924320," hours and i think we checked the this language deep enough we probed this language deep enough"
5924320,5932720," and my verdict is that i'm not against of this language i can programming it i feel like it's"
5932720,5940720," could be better than c i like this language eight out of ten so this is my verdict eight out of ten"
5940720,5947760," after two hours of playing with this language eight out of ten not bad not bad not bad not bad so yeah"
5947760,5955120," uh that's it for today thanks everyone who's watching right now i really appreciate it"
5955760,5963760," have a good one and i see you all on the next recreation programming session with who a mr as always and i love you"
