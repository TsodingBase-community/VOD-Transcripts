160,5840," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session"
5840,11600," how about it let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start the stream"
11600,19520," as usual as usual uh red circle live on twitch and what are we doing today on twitch.tv"
19520,26320," website today we are uh simulating actual freaking life and see i feel like i went a"
26320,31200," little bit over the board with that title but i think it's good enough uh it's good enough uh"
31200,39520," welcome to the internet in 2023 so i'm going to give the link to http uh as slash tv and i'm going"
39520,45520," to ping everyone who's interested in being pink and there we go the stream has officially started"
45520,50640," the stream has officially started hello hello everyone welcome welcome welcome really glad to"
50640,55840," see you all today so today we're going to be looking into this paper right it's a relatively"
55840,63360," old paper right so it's from 2011 right as you can see uh relatively old but still kind of relevant"
63360,71200," it's a generalization of conveys game of life uh to a continuous domain aka smooth life right so a lot"
71200,77280," of people probably know what is a game of life conveys game of life is this it's this cell automaton that"
77280,84400," actually very simple it is extremely simple but it gives the birth to uh like a lot of complexity so it"
84400,92000," has a lot of emergent complexity and if we google it up game of life uh right so and uh there are some"
92000,100800," animations i think uh that demonstrate that uh so gay the game of life by that's not the game of life i was"
100800,110160," looking for actually that's the wrong game of life what the uh okay thank you thank you dr go very cool"
110160,119360," every time i want to switch to duck the go shit like that happens to me uh anyway so conveys game of life"
119360,124960," uh right so you you can see this like a lot of different interesting complexities so this is"
124960,130480," basically conveys game of life this thing is just like a shooting gliders and glider is probably the"
130480,137440," the most like interesting structure that emerges out of the conveys game of life uh right so but"
137440,145600," this paper is about actually taking this discrete thing and um generalizing it to a continuous domain as it"
145600,151920," basically says right so and it looks actually kind of spectacular right if you google up smooth life"
151920,159040," right a smooth life it's actually kind of cool it's just like game of life uh but uh it's actually like"
159040,166320," very continuous and it creates this sort of like you know um biological like structures and everything"
166320,173760," it's just actually freaking spectacular uh right and it's not on uh a finite discrete grid it's actually"
173760,182000," continuous right so in in game of life uh the cell can be only in two states uh zero or one uh dead or"
182000,190400," alive right so this thing in this thing the cell can be uh in any state between zero and one so its state is"
190400,198480," continuous right its state is kind of continuous uh right so and it actually creates it has its own gliders"
198480,205360," right it has its own gliders that look like this uh right and they are unlike the game of conveys game"
205360,212400," of life uh gliders they're um they're only directional so that means they can move in any directions or not only"
212400,218880," diagonally right so and i think that was the goal basically of this paper is to just come up with the"
218880,226880," uh sort of like a conveys game of life uh that creates on the directional gliders right so and"
226880,233760," the problem with the uh smooth life right the problem with smooth life is that um it feels a"
233760,239600," little bit gatekeeping i don't think it's intentional but uh you can quite easily just"
239600,244800," look at the wikipedia page of uh conveys game of life and get an idea on how to implement it on the"
244800,250080," computer right and that's what made it made it so popular that's what made it so popular because like"
250080,255440," anyone even without any like mathematical background or anything just like can open that page read that"
255440,260800," page and understand what the fuck is going on this thing you open this paper and the first thing you're"
260800,270320," greeted with is a freaking integrals what the fuck is this like what the hell is just like no like it's just"
270320,275280," like everyone is going to be scared away from from from that but i do understand where they're coming"
275280,282160," from i i do understand where they're coming from because it's a continuous thing right it's a continuous"
282160,290400," thing and they need to describe continuous sums right so and that's why it just goes here and it's a little"
290400,296320," bit scary like what the fuck is going on in here it's it's not like uh conveys game of life where you can"
296320,302560," have a description of of a power of about the paragraph right and there you go that's enough"
302560,307680," for you to implement that like you yeah you need to understand what the fuck is going on in here"
307680,312320," and that's why not that many people actually implement this thing there are some implementations"
312320,317680," of this kind of stuff but it's not like game of life where anyone on any machine with any programming"
317680,323120," language can just like sit down and implement this entire thing uh right so it's kind of like um"
324160,329680," yeah it's a bit gatekeepy but i don't think it was intentional so and the cool thing here is"
329680,334640," that uh if you managed to implement it you would start seeing these kind of structures and that's"
334640,340240," basically the the glider that we're uh looking for right so it's an omnidirectional glider so in this"
340240,344640," case i think it's going to be moving in that direction so it moves towards the thickest part"
344640,350880," right so this thickest part actually moved there and notice how fuzzy it is right notice how fuzzy it is"
350880,358320," and this is because uh like each pixel is kind of a cell right and the cell is continuous from zero to"
358320,363440," one right and that's why it's maybe fuzzy on the edges because these cells are in the transitional"
363440,370480," states or something like that right so uh that's basically what's going on in here um right so luckily"
370480,375120," this paper is actually very small right so even though it's kind of like starts with the intervals it's"
375120,381040," just four pages i read the entirety of this paper i kind of understood majority of the thing they were"
381040,388080," trying to convey except a couple of things but i think we can try to ignore them right so my goal for"
388080,395680," today would be to try to implement this thing at least in a console right at least in the console"
395680,400720," and see if we can simulate this thing in the console and produce interesting patterns and if we have"
400720,408400," enough time if we have enough time we may try to port that to gpu uh to a fragment shader because i think"
408400,415200," from what i understood by reading this paper um so it's actually relatively easy to port to fragment shaders"
415200,423200," right so essentially you can store the state of the of the cell automaton in a texture then you can have"
423200,429600," a shader that computes the next state into frame buffer and then you can reuse it again as a texture"
429600,435120," and sort of like progress by doing draw calls a single draw call is going to be basically competing the"
435120,441440," next state of this cell uh cell automaton and since all that in parallel it should be like super fast"
441440,448800," and i think that will be actually kind of clean um right so some people uh actually appointed uh at"
448800,457680," linear linear right uh linear uh so this is another interesting thing i think it was actually done"
457680,463840," relatively recently right in 2018 right or somewhere uh it's relatively recently and it's basically"
463840,471120," continuation of the idea of smooth wipe uh right if you actually take a look at the paper on the linear i don't"
471120,481440," know how to pronounce this thing by the way linear paper so it's even more scary than this right"
481440,488000," it's even more scary than this i'm gonna show you i also partially read that paper too i also partially"
488000,494000," read that paper too i couldn't actually do it to the end because um how complicated it is right"
494000,504000," but the cool thing about that paper right the cool thing about that paper is that um uh what they tried"
504000,511200," to do right so they tried to do something something different uh the smooth life if you take a look at"
511200,518320," smooth life you can treat it as a framework for defining continuous cellular automatons right uh so what they did"
518320,524560," there they said okay so that that framework has uh different parameters right this framework has different"
524560,531120," parameters and they also added their own parameters and they ask a question okay so tweaking that parameters"
531120,537520," can we come up with interesting creatures like how many interesting creatures we can come up with"
537520,542560," if we just like tweak those parameters and what they did if i understood correctly from that paper"
542560,549600," they made an automated system that basically brute forced different parameters of the environment and"
549600,556880," used artificial intelligence to basically recognize the patterns to capture the most interesting creatures"
556880,564160," and they managed to categorize uh around 400 different creatures like they managed to identify them uh"
564160,567920," right and there is a lot of interesting creatures in here so we're not going to be doing that today but it's"
567920,573200," just something interesting to keep in mind this is what people were doing with this kind of idea"
573200,577600," uh right so this is basically different creatures that they managed to actually capture and categorize"
577600,582640," right so there are some interesting things that spin around uh right so this is like different kinds"
582640,591440," of gliders uh yeah this one so these kind of things they actually spin around uh so yeah so the cool part"
591440,597360," of this specific paper is that they had to build an automatic system to actually capture those creatures"
597360,603040," right so they didn't do that manually uh right they didn't do that manually that they did that"
603040,609440," automatically uh so that's what's cool about it so they also there's like a last i think page somewhere"
609440,614480," where they actually compared some of the found creatures with the real life creatures and found"
614480,620480," similarities right between like a uh like you know single cell creatures in real life and what they"
620480,627680," found uh in in this thing so it's also kind of cool right so i'm gonna put both of the papers in the"
627680,633360," description of course so first paper the one that we're going to be doing today right it's the smooth life"
633360,639040," and uh basically linear i hope i pronounced it correctly right so it's gonna be this one"
639040,646320," so uh smooth life paper linear paper i'm not sure if today's stream is going to be interesting enough"
646320,653200," and we get somewhere maybe we can try to implement uh linear and we'll see how it goes right so but it's"
653200,657360," probably not going to be on today's stream right so it's probably not going to go to this stream so"
657360,664640," here i actually gave the pdf so let's actually give the actual pdf in here uh all right so uh"
664640,671600," we've got some subs we've got some stuff from marks uh 77 thank you so much for which prime subscription"
671600,675840," thank you thank you thank you uh how are you guys doing hello hello hello"
682560,687200," cool idea of implementing papers yeah it's actually kind of cool uh though sometimes it's kind of hard"
687200,694240," to like find interesting papers but i don't know paper review right imagine paper review series from"
694240,702080," zozin right where i take a paper and implement it uh on the stream from scratch in c that's an interesting"
702080,708160," idea actually right but i'm not sure if i smart enough to do any paper uh it like it was kind of hard"
708160,716400," for me to read this thing uh already so i don't know how it's gonna go right so uh we've got another"
716400,722000," sub uh junior frettas thank you so much for uh tier one subscription uh with a message it's so didn't"
722000,727200," sleep so didn't sleep so didn't sleep uh i hope this is not because the stream is boring but and thank"
727200,737120," you thank you so much for uh tier one subscription uh so um let's uh knock things off by implementing like"
737120,742400," maybe a simple c program right so i want to implement like a renderer the terminal renderer"
742400,749200," uh that would allow us to actually um you know display the state of smooth life right so in case"
749200,755200," of the game of life you just have two states zero and one but here we have a continuous state from zero"
755200,760800," to one so we have to actually display that somehow like i don't want to start with a complicated renderer"
760800,766160," with like using graphical library or anything like that i want to just start very very simple right so how"
766160,771760," we're going to do that uh let me let me actually go to zozin and i'm going to create a folder smooth"
771760,778880," uh smooth life there we go and i'm going to open main.c and let's just like implement a simple hello"
778880,795040," uh right so uh this is going to be printf hello c man all right uh and let's do build.sh and uh let's do bmsh and let's"
795040,802640," let's simply build this into our stuff main main.c let's also enable all of the warnings all of the"
802640,808640," extra warning warnings as well let's make this executable and let's build this entire uh shites"
808640,812480," okay"
812480,820960," uh all right so for those who doesn't know hello simon is basically a reference to john blow constantly writing"
820960,829680," hello sailor right so it's sort of like a theme related to you know seas and sheep and i decided"
829680,837600," like why not basically follow follow his advice and say hello seaman as well yeah so i think it makes sense"
837600,843920," uh okay so let's define the grid right let's define some sort of a grid uh let's actually define what kind"
843920,850000," of like size of the width we're going to have right so let's make it 10 by 10 uh right and let's"
850000,858560," initialize that grid so this is going to be of course height and i start with the height and then width"
858560,866080," because the uh the way c stores the multi-dimensional arrays right because of how c stores multi-dimensional"
866080,872960," race it stores them row wise right so and essentially this is basically the rows and this is the columns"
872960,879280," even though it's width and height i think about this thing uh in terms of uh rows and columns right"
879280,885200," that's why i prefer like putting height first and width second right so because i think about how it's"
885200,893040," located in the memory right so when i'm writing the code i actually don't see the text i don't see the code"
893040,901280," i see uh the memory layout believe it or not right so i just like visualize the memory layout and"
901280,907920," that actually dictates a lot of like um decisions that i make in my code right so because of how the"
907920,914000," arrays are stored in the memory i prefer to first define the uh you know the rows and then the columns"
914000,918560," it's a matter of metrics right so it's a matrix order basically so i think they do the same thing in"
919280,925680," um in in math right so because in math the first index is the row and the second index is the column"
925680,931440," right so anyway since it's a continuous thing it's going to be grid of floats right so this is a"
931440,936320," grace of floats and let's actually initialize it with zeros uh so one of the things we probably want"
936320,942640," to do we want to basically initialize this grid with uh random bullshit right so uh"
943600,949840," let's actually iterate uh by y right so this is going to be y uh iterating height plus plus y"
949840,952960," size t x"
952960,960640," it's going to be less than width so this is going to be that and essentially i want to have"
960640,966960," uh like a random float from zero to one i think we already implemented this kind of thing in"
966960,972400," uh an end dot h right in our uh deep learning framework and see but they can implement it"
972400,978000," one more time because it's such a simple function right it's not uh it's not worth like copy pasting"
978000,984160," or going going anywhere in there uh right so essentially uh rand there is a rand function"
984160,991680," in c and it returns a value from zero to uh rand max so in essentially what you can do you can cast"
991680,996880," both of these things to float and divide the smallest things by the maximum thing and you will"
996880,1002640," get basically a ratio uh from zero to one and that's basically like everything that you need to happen"
1002640,1010400," here uh right and after that we can try to maybe print the state of the board the state of the grid"
1010400,1017200," just to see what's in there that will be kind of nice to see what kind of values we manage to generate"
1017200,1026000," there uh right so this is going to be print f and we're going to do f grid y x and then here at the"
1026000,1030480," end i'm going to put a new line and there we go let's take a look at what we've got so first i'm"
1030480,1035120," going to review this entire thing and i'm going to run this entire stuff rand max is not available"
1035120,1040560," everything is broken nothing worked that's why you have to program in javascript because you never have"
1040560,1044720," to compile so you're never going to have compilation errors even though you're going to have um"
1045760,1052160," runtime errors right so but who cares at least you're not going to have any compilation errors so here we"
1052160,1059280," just need to include std right so and there we go so here is a random bullshite so this is a random"
1059280,1067680," bullshite so but it's not particularly random because we also probably want to uh you know set the seed"
1067680,1074160," we want to set the god seed we're setting the god seed and there we go it is different every single"
1074160,1079760," second right so every second a god seed is uh renewed"
1079760,1090400," and this is because the time function returns the current seconds since the unix epoch right from 1970"
1090400,1096160," 0101 or something like that i think this is how postex system actually store the time but i'm not a"
1096160,1102880," programmer so i don't really know so essentially how can we visualize that how can we visualize that's a"
1102880,1107360," very interesting question like we don't want to visualize our shit like this it doesn't make any"
1107360,1114000," freaking sense uh right so one of the things we can do we can treat these failures as the brightness"
1114000,1118160," right we can treat this failure as the brightness and essentially we can"
1118720,1124480," quantize that brightness we can quite quantize that brand brightness so essentially we can have some sort"
1124480,1132960," of like um table of levels right so this is going to be a level uh and essentially the um"
1132960,1142400," the brightness with a very low very low brightness is going to be denoted by simply a space that makes"
1142400,1149120," sense right so a slightly higher brightness right a slightly higher brightness is going to be denoted"
1149120,1160160," by dot makes sense right makes sense even higher one probably underscore right so even brighter so here"
1160160,1167440," is just like a one single line let's put two lines it's going to be equals so then maybe even brighter is"
1167440,1174800," going to be like a letter let's put it like c right so it's even brighter something even brighter is like"
1174800,1183520," c but closed it's going to be all right and then we can can keep making it more and more dense and dense"
1183520,1189360," right dense and dense and essentially what we got here we've got here a gradient so here maybe i want to"
1189360,1194080," actually use like a dash right i think that actually makes a little bit more sense right so as you can"
1194080,1204400," see they come from less dense to more dense um right uh dense not not dance like i don't know how to speak"
1204400,1212320," english i'm sorry uh right and essentially we can use this entire thing as uh basically the table for for"
1212320,1216400," the levels right so and if you have some sort of a brightness right so imagine that you have"
1217360,1225280," uh a grid right you have a grid of this specific value how can you determine how can you determine"
1225280,1231440," uh what kind of character you have to replace it with you need to take an interval you need to take"
1231440,1238960," an interval from zero to one and divide it by the amount of levels in here right so uh let's actually"
1238960,1246560," let's actually do the following thing all right so this is going to be one uh and divide by the level"
1246560,1253760," uh levels size right so maybe levels count so this is this is called actually level so let's go to"
1253760,1259520," level right so and this is going to be a continuous thing and basically it will tell you the the segment"
1259520,1269440," right so the segment and then by uh essentially dividing uh your entire thing by that segment you"
1269440,1276080," get an index an index in that table right and so what's interesting is that uh if you actually simplify"
1276080,1282000," this entire expression you're going to end up with just uh multiplying grid by the level count right so"
1282000,1286240," and you can already use this as an index within the level but you have to be a little bit careful"
1286240,1291440," right so you probably want to do something like minus one right because the grid equal to one will"
1291440,1296880," make this entire expression equal to level count which is the out of bounds for this specific array"
1296880,1302160," right so which is out of bounds so you probably don't want to do this kind of uh right and then"
1302160,1307520," you probably want to truncate it by converting it to an integer and then you'll be able to just like"
1307520,1313840," take this specific level uh right so and then just print it right so let's actually try to do something"
1313840,1321440," like this right so we don't have a level count right so let's actually maybe do something like this maybe"
1321440,1331600," it's going to be something like that so if i do size of level divided by size of level one i'll get the"
1331600,1339200," amount of elements in this specific array which is actually going to be kind of uh kind of not correct"
1339200,1346880," you'll see why so let me uh just print the amount of uh levels that we've got in here right so i'm"
1346880,1356240," gonna do something like print that uh right so this is gonna be zero so level count level count equal to"
1356240,1365040," that uh level count yeah and let's see how many levels we've got right so this one has to be something"
1365040,1372320," 11 right but is that true right if we try to count how many characters you have in here it actually"
1372320,1380320," says that we have 10 characters so what's going on right why trying to do something like that actually"
1380320,1386720," yields 11 characters what but here we have 10 of them right because this is a string literal and"
1386720,1395440," string literally has an implicit zero at the end of it because welcome to c in 2023 yes that that's"
1395440,1400800," right so that's that's the actual reason welcome this is the most beautiful language on planet earth"
1400800,1405520," kappa right so and this is something that you have to be aware of this is something that you have to be"
1405520,1412720," aware of and just do minus one right so if you are initializing array of characters with a string literal"
1412720,1417760," specifically with a string literal specifically it's going to be like that so what's fun is that if we"
1417760,1422240," initialize array of characters like character by character i don't think it's going to be the thing"
1422240,1426880," so can a query replace with a regular expression where i can say okay single character has to be"
1426880,1433360," replaced with um actually yeah single character which is also captured because we'll need to be able to"
1433360,1439520," recreate that uh also replace this entire thing with the original character and also comma will i be able"
1439520,1453520," to do that can your vim do that i don't think so yo okay vim can do that i know uh thank you very much"
1453520,1461200," so if you initialize this entire thing like this right so uh it's gonna be 10 right it's gonna be 10"
1461200,1466560," it's gonna be correct uh but if you do it like this if you do it like this it's gonna be 11."
1469520,1483760," you can also specify the byte size uh like this it says the chat right so this is the message like"
1483760,1489600," i'm not making it up and then when i add another character in here i should not forget to increment"
1489600,1496400," this thing so maintainability of the code decreased dramatically because to add a single thing now i have"
1496400,1506560," to modify two places thank you very much no uh i'm not gonna do that so uh now um yeah so essentially"
1506560,1512160," what we're gonna do is just like minus one right so simply minus one and everything is okay so we have"
1512160,1518960," a convenient uh way of defining this entire stuff and there it goes so we're good to go we're gucci to go"
1518960,1524080," so and the only thing we need to do in here is just like literally print this entire thing right so just"
1524080,1532160," literally print uh this entire x and let's see if it works at all it doesn't freaking work uh let's find out"
1532160,1544080," why so array subscription is of character doesn't really um so i suppose i have to wrap this stuff around"
1544080,1552560," there we go so something kind of worked uh but at the same time as you can see this is yeah that looks weird"
1554080,1562160," uh that just looks weird and oh yeah so i suppose i see what's going on i see what's going on there we go"
1562160,1570320," yeah as you can see now we have a random noise so this is basically a random noise that's pretty cool"
1570320,1576080," so on top of that we can make it a little bit bigger so what about 100 so this is basically yeah so emacs wants to"
1576080,1581520," want to highlight some shit in here i don't know why but yeah so because it uh automatically recognizes"
1581520,1586880," some of the patterns in here right so because it wants to maybe parse some things to make it more"
1586880,1595040," like readable and stuff like that but there we go so now we have a thing that allows us that allows us to"
1595040,1603440," display the continuous state of the board right so now we are able to display that continuousness and stuff"
1603440,1609680," like that now we need to understand how do you even compute the next state right"
1609680,1616960," so how do you even compute the next state so in original game of life the next state is computed"
1616960,1622800," by looking at the neighborhood right so you basically count how many uh alive cells you have"
1622800,1630880," and based on the current state on your current state and how many neighbors you have alive neighbors you have"
1630880,1638000," you make a decision either to stay alive or to die or to get born and so on and so forth right so that's"
1638000,1644880," basically what decides the transition so here we have everything continuous right here we have everything"
1644880,1650960," continuous so in the neighborhood of the cell is described by these two in integrals right which are"
1650960,1659360," kind of scary but in reality they mean uh a ring right so essentially let me actually uh open up uh my paint"
1659360,1661840," so let me actually open up my paint"
1661840,1671920," so imagine that this is an infinite board of a smooth life and we're trying to compute the next state of that"
1671920,1679520," specific point right so essentially what we do we look at the circle around this entire thing"
1679520,1689840," and this uh has a radius which is called ri which is the inner radius of the ring right so this is the inner"
1689840,1696880," radius of the ring then uh we have outer radius of the ring so the outer radius of the ring"
1696880,1708080," like this i can't draw this shot okay let me try to do something like that it's not particularly"
1708080,1717280," even radius right but it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't apologize for that so anyway so this is the"
1717280,1726000," basically the outer one the paper denotes that outer thing as r a so i is inner that's why it's i and a"
1726000,1731840," is outer i don't know why it's not o but maybe because outer ah"
1731840,1741600," i don't know maybe that's why essentially right so and you you have to keep in mind so this is basically"
1741600,1747040," you have different cells values of the cells in here and you have different values of the cells in here"
1747040,1754800," so what you do you literally iterate through all of the cells in the inner uh circle in here an outer"
1754800,1761520," one so if i remember correctly the inner one is called yeah they called m right so basically m is"
1761520,1769680," the sum of all of the values inside of this thing right so this is inside and n uh is basically uh the sum"
1769680,1775760," of all of all of this thing on this outer ring in here right so and uh what's interesting is that"
1775760,1782080," instead of the uh sigma i think i think this is the sigma so the sum is denoted by sigma they're using"
1782080,1789600," an integral symbol and this is because they want to imply that it may happen on a continuous space"
1790560,1796000," right but since we're working with computers right which are digital computers discrete computers and"
1796000,1802400," we can't really model continuous things on such machines uh right so we're going to be using like"
1802400,1811360," an actual sums right an integral just it's basically a sum like it's basically a sum but it just implies that"
1811360,1818880," somewhere in this hypothetical world where we have uh you know rainbows and ponies and stuff like that"
1818880,1823280," it's going to be continuous and it's going to be so fucking smooth it's just like holy"
1823280,1827360," fucking shit you're gonna fucking come but in real world we we can't afford"
1827360,1839440," right so what i'm trying to say is just don't be scared of this integral right because in reality"
1839440,1844240," it's just a fucking sum of the points around the current point so that's what it is"
1849760,1855680," hey welcome to the paper review with zozin okay so i think we've got a bunch of subs that i need to acknowledge"
1855680,1863760," all right so um um gaetan florio thank you so much for a tier one subscription"
1863760,1868720," smoky bear and thank you so much for tier one subscription and johnny diresta thank you so much"
1868720,1876720," for twitch prime 13 month more than a year with a message yo ayo my friend all right"
1879120,1886560," uh my eyes with the white white white oh i mean we can just download this thing okay so if you don't"
1886560,1888160," want me to flash bang you"
1888160,1905120," freaking do you want me to just save this entire thing like i mean they banned w get that's what they"
1905120,1914240," did for no freaking reason i don't know why uh all right so yeah so the archive be be like that sometimes"
1914240,1920000," so let's actually move this entire thing in here um so this is going to be this one and there we go so"
1920000,1925120," here is the paper i'm going to open in new pdf and i'm going to invert it is it better now"
1925920,1934320," is it better so this is our paper now so i'm going to close this into i think uh right so yeah it's kind"
1934320,1938640," of difficult to read if if i could make the background more like grayish rather than black"
1938640,1952240," i think it would have been like less harsh on the ice black is a little bit too strong right and"
1952240,1959280," essentially uh what you can think of these two values right so m is the sum of the values uh literally the"
1959280,1965680," sum of the values uh in the inner circle and n is the sum on the outer circle you can think of these two"
1965680,1973600," parameters as basically the amount of debt and alive uh cells in the conveys game of life"
1973600,1980560," right so in conveys game of life you have um actually you have your current state the amount"
1980560,1986320," of debt the amount of life and based on that you make a decision where to transition right so but in"
1986320,1991920," this thing uh you make a decision based on that right and based on these two values and how do you make a"
1991920,1999760," decision you have a very smooth continuous function uh which they call here uh i think s yeah so this"
1999760,2007920," is basically s uh right so this is basically s and you feed these two parameters into this function"
2007920,2013200," and that function tells you the next state for the current thing in here that's it"
2016400,2021280," i'm not even joking that is it almost right almost so"
2021280,2028800," uh right so and we just basically we have to do like we have to iterate through each point"
2028800,2035040," consider this neighborhood of the rings uh right and compute the next state for them like it's the same"
2035040,2041520," way you would do uh the same thing you would do for the conveys game of life it's just like the function"
2041520,2046800," more continuous more more complicated and stuff like that so what's going to be this function well this"
2046800,2052320," function okay so if you want to take one variant of the definition so essentially i think you can"
2052320,2057200," use different functions but they have to be like have a certain property one of the functions they have"
2057200,2066800," this property is this one right so s is going to be defined as composition of these three functions right"
2066800,2071120," so you see this is a composition of these three functions and here are these three functions"
2071120,2078000," but i mean you don't have to understand them like do you do you really need to understand them you can"
2078000,2083920," treat them as black boxes just like yeah so the the actual framework here is that you like uh basically"
2083920,2090480," take these two parameters and you have this magical blob from the from the vendor from the vendor of the of"
2090480,2097440," the paper uh you feed this data into this proprietary blob and it spits out the next state of this thing"
2097440,2102560," right we do that all the time with the nvidia drivers so and everyone's fine with that for some"
2102560,2107120," reason but when it comes to papers everyone is just oh gatekeeping gatekeeping i mean it's just like it's"
2107120,2114240," a binary blob what did you do you know what i mean it's just like"
2114240,2121120," what's interesting is that some people notice that it's a sigma it's actually sigmoids right it's"
2121120,2127200," actually very close to the sigmoid that is used in uh artificial intelligence machine learning and neural"
2127200,2135680," networks the actual definition of sigmoids that is used in there i think just minus x right so it's one"
2135680,2142560," divided by one plus exponent minus x but as you can see here they actually introduce a bunch of"
2142560,2148480," parameters so i suppose to shift the sigmoid around to some sort of like a state or whatnot"
2148480,2156240," um also it would be cool to try simpler function yeah that would be actually kind of cool as far as"
2156240,2163040," as far as they say here that none of that like smoothness is really needed uh right so"
2163040,2174160," i don't remember where they said that but yeah so and essentially you also want to make a smoother"
2174160,2181600," transition you also want to make a smoother transition uh in terms of like a time because essentially uh what"
2181600,2188640," what you're getting here in reality you don't really get like a step you get the next state uh"
2189440,2196080," of the like the the state on the next second right so if you measure the time in seconds you get the"
2196080,2202800," state on the next second or let's say on the time on on the next uh unit of time uh but what if you're"
2202800,2210320," running with 60 fps and you want to actually do like step 16 times within one unit of time"
2210320,2216080," right how we divide that so essentially they say they can you can treat uh this thing as actually"
2216080,2220720," a derivative of the function and basically the direction in which you want to move the current"
2220720,2226240," state and you instead of like setting this as the next state you can just add this thing multiplied by"
2226240,2232000," data time and it will work as well right so that's essentially what they say in here right but one of"
2232000,2237680," the things you have to do you have to map its value from minus one to one to zero to one or the other"
2237680,2244720," way around but whatever okay so uh let me let me see let me see"
2244720,2249520," so"
2249520,2258880," so we've got some subs we get some subs let me acknowledge that uh xerza thank you so much for"
2258880,2262640," a tier one subscription thank you so much for tier one subscription okay go"
2264080,2268240," uh so we'll go ahead and try to implement that so and as you can see there is a lot of parameters in"
2268240,2274000," here right so uh there are radius and stuff like that and this is one of the things you can try to tweak"
2274000,2281280," right and experiment and see uh what kind of creatures you can come up with right so okay go so"
2281280,2289600," let's maybe let's maybe define the outer and inner radius as far as i know as far as i know in the paper they"
2289600,2294960," just say that you can only need to define the outer like inner radius because the outer radius is going"
2294960,2301200," to be like yeah so essentially you define the inner one and the best result you can achieve is just"
2301200,2309040," basically by multiplied by three and here is the outer radius right so that's basically it so that's pretty"
2309040,2318880," cool okay so uh let's define the uh our a uh and let's say i don't know so they have some example at the bottom"
2320080,2326480," right so they have some example at the bottom so here they say the outer is going to be 21 right"
2326480,2334800," i don't know so they basically suggesting that we want to define the outer one first and then compute"
2334800,2339440," the inner based on that i mean sure let's actually define it the other way around so this is going to be"
2339440,2345840," 21 so essentially they achieve this glider by using these parameters in here right so and maybe this is"
2345840,2352960," the parameters we're going to be using so why not uh okay so what i want to be able to do i want to be"
2352960,2360960," able to compute this n and m for uh for a particular sort of point on the grid right so i want to be able to"
2360960,2366560," do this kind of stuff so maybe i'm going to actually factor out some of these things in here so here is"
2366560,2372080," basically a random initialization right so it's actually called random grid right so this is a"
2372080,2378400," random grid uh and i'm going to literally move this entire stuff in there just factor it out random"
2378400,2385360," grid right and in here we have a basically procedure that displays the grid right so let's actually do"
2385360,2394480," something like display grid uh right and we'll just get the stuff in there so displaying the grid display"
2394480,2402720," grid cool so and as we generated the random grid so what i want to do i want to just like basically"
2402720,2412480," uh define maybe uh like a point right so let's actually say that i'm going to have x uh which is"
2412480,2418720," going to be like zero right and y is also going to be zero and that's the point for which we are going"
2418720,2424320," to be computing n uh m and n right so initially they're going to be zero right so initially they're"
2424320,2433280," going to be zero uh right there we go so what's going to be the next thing we're going to do what's"
2433280,2440000," going to be the next thing we're going to do uh i suppose we just need to iterate the the whole circle"
2440000,2448480," right so we just need to iterate a whole circle so essentially what we can do we can uh just iterate"
2448480,2458640," the enclosing cube a square of this thing right so here is the current point x and y uh right here is"
2458640,2466960," its outer thing here is its outer thing we can construct uh a square that basically encircles this"
2466960,2473920," entire thing and iterate pixel by pixel this entire thing and if the point is within the circle we're"
2473920,2478560," going to consider it if the thing is outside the circle we're not going to consider it and then we"
2478560,2485360," can even try to check is it within outer circle or inner circle and depending on which circle it's in"
2485360,2491120," we're going to actually edit to either m or n right so that's basically how mechanically we're going to be"
2491120,2499600," doing the integration right so that's basically what what we're going to do so that's my idea at least for"
2499600,2508000," now uh all right so and that is uh determined by the radius right so let's actually maybe start an"
2508000,2513760," iteration so size t and we're going to actually iterate with dx right so this is going to be dx and dy"
2513760,2525040," right so we probably want to start with minus r a uh and dy uh r a right something like that"
2525040,2533840," so essentially let me think so if r a is equal to three right if r a is equal to three we are located"
2533840,2540800," somewhere in here right so we're located somewhere in here we can do one two three uh right and we're"
2540800,2549840," starting to iterate so from somewhere here and this is not particularly what i want in here right because"
2549840,2559600," this entire thing doesn't have a radius of three it has a radius of four so that means uh what we"
2559600,2570640," probably want to do we want to actually iterate maybe like minus one up until uh this thing right"
2570640,2575920," and if we did something like less we wouldn't have to do minus one in here so and essentially the reason"
2575920,2580240," why i want to do it like that is because then i will be able to just say y plus w and that's going"
2580240,2585760," to be like the actual uh the actual point on the grid that they can consider and just do something"
2585760,2592640," with right so i suppose that kind of makes sense so we want to do a similar thing for dx right so this"
2592640,2598160," is going to be for dx uh and there we go all right so this is what we're iterating and then"
2599440,2607040," right so maybe it would make sense to actually call this thing cx and cy uh because it's a center"
2607040,2612240," and since uh this thing can be negative i think it's not a good idea to actually use size because it's"
2612240,2617680," unsigned right so we want to actually use integer which is signed uh right because we're gonna do signed"
2617680,2624480," arithmetics and stuff like that uh right so uh and let's do the following thing we're gonna uh create"
2624480,2634960," x uh cx plus dx uh y is going to be cy by dy and there we go so and that basically tells us the actual"
2634960,2641040," thing in the grid but here's an interesting thing so if you are at the left top corner right if you're at"
2641040,2648640," the left top corner uh this thing might be out of bounds right how do we handle out of bounds situation"
2648640,2654960," uh with this kind of stuff uh so essentially we can just wrap it around right we can wrap this entire"
2654960,2662400," thing around so uh usually to wrap things around people use mod right so mod is a very useful thing"
2662400,2672240," uh right essentially if you have the width equal to one or two to 100 right and uh your x is 101"
2672240,2679120," you can just do mod and it wraps it around and as you go further right so it just keeps wrapping around"
2679120,2686400," and uh as you can see then if you go to 200 it wraps around to zero again right so but as far as i know"
2686400,2691760," it doesn't work the other way around i think in python it does work if you do like minus one yeah"
2691760,2696480," in python they actually specifically fix that but it doesn't work like that in all of the languages so"
2696480,2702800," in node.js if you try to do something like this if it starts up at all minus one uh and mod 100 you're"
2702800,2712320," gonna end up with uh with 100 so usually the usual way to fix all of that is uh basically uh add the thing"
2712320,2719520," that you're modding by and that as you can see fixes that but that on the other hand breaks the positive case"
2719520,2725120," right so as you can see positive case doesn't work anymore and for that case you do mod one-handed"
2725120,2733120," again right so in that case uh negative case works and positive case works so that's how we do that"
2733120,2740960," essentially right so as far as i know in uh in rust this kind of mode operation is called euclidean mode"
2740960,2748240," and because of that i like to create function called e-mode right so and in e-mode you basically have two uh things in"
2748240,2754000," here where you just literally do divide it by b then you fix the negative case which breaks the"
2754000,2759840," positive case and then you fix uh the positive case again by doing something like that right"
2759840,2766400," uh so and once you have e-mode uh so you can essentially do the following thing so we have"
2766400,2773280," something like this and then you can say e-mode width and e-mode uh height and there we go you can be"
2773280,2779520," 100% sure that x and y is going to be within the boundaries of the grid right so it's going to be"
2779520,2787920," within the boundaries of the grid uh right so and let's uh and then you can just basically uh do the"
2787920,2798480," following stuff so now we need to see um whether this entire thing is within the inner or outer circle right so"
2800880,2808640," how can we even do that so we have a outer circle so an inner circle so uh is going to be ra divided by"
2808640,2822560," three right so that's basically the uh the inner circle um so okay cool and so we need to know the um"
2823760,2830000," the width of this entire stuff right the width and height interestingly interestingly believe it or not"
2830000,2838320," we can already use dx and dy to determine whether we are within uh the inner or outer thing in here so"
2838320,2845760," we can just literally use dx the square of dx then uh the square of dy and then security f and that gives"
2845760,2853520," us the length of the current thing and we can already consider it so if it's for instance less than the"
2853520,2859840," inner circle if it's less than the inner circle we are within the inner one uh and where is this thing"
2859840,2867920," so let's actually go back to the integrals right uh so we have to add it to m right so we have to add this"
2867920,2878080," that thing to m um so all right"
2878080,2892160," so m plus uh greed so i suppose we will have to pre-compute this stuff anyway uh y and x but here's an"
2892160,2898320," interesting thing right here's an interesting thing so maybe we want to also make it equal uh if we rise"
2898320,2904480," both of the sides to like a power of two we don't have to call to square effectively make it and making"
2904480,2911760," it a little bit faster right because square root is actually kind of a heavy heavy operation right so and"
2911760,2920000," then the next thing we can check right uh otherwise uh if this entire thing uh less than the outer one"
2920000,2925200," right and since because it's else uh we know that it's bigger than this thing so here we know that"
2925200,2933120," it's between the uh inner and outer circle we have to add this entire thing to uh essentially grid uh y"
2933120,2942080," x there we go uh and yeah there we go so essentially we compute this entire thing for uh for the"
2942080,2948160," for the point zero zero right so we can now bring this entire stuff so m is going to be equal to that"
2948720,2957920," n is going to be equal to that so m and n so and do we even see anything so i think i want to remove"
2957920,2963600," this entire stuff right so i want to remove this entire stuff and there we go uh right so we get"
2963600,2970400," these two parameters but here is the interesting thing um there is some sort of divided by m and"
2970400,2977360," divided by n for these values correspondingly and this is what the paper says about these things n and m are"
2977360,2987520," normalization factors such as that feeling is between zero and one so these values have to be between zero"
2987520,2999680," and one how can we even achieve this kind of stuff so essentially um um when m is going to be equal to one"
3001360,3008800," when each individual point within the inner circle is going to be equal to one so that means m is the"
3008800,3018720," area is the area of the circle of the inner circle and n corresponding is the area of the ring of the outer"
3018720,3024960," ring in there right so essentially we have to sum up all of the like sum of all of the values within the"
3024960,3031440," the circle and divide by the area of the circle to normalize it to a value from zero to one and the same"
3031440,3036000," thing has to be done in here because they're going to be equal to one when each individual thing here is"
3036000,3046960," equal to one aka the surface of the uh the surface of the of the circle does it make sense so we can try to uh you know"
3046960,3057120," um bust out the formula for computing the um the area of the circle right we can do that right but"
3057120,3067120," i'm thinking about a more interesting thing what if we literally count um how many pixels we have within"
3067120,3074400," those things so essentially just a second we can literally define big m and big n"
3074400,3084240," i mean if it technically it's going to be an an area or something very close to an area it's going to be"
3084240,3093680," something very close to an area so when we do plus uh like m plus this thing we can do uh plus one and here plus one"
3096240,3105200," and effectively i mean i'm not a mathematician i'm an engineer okay i'm an engineer so whatever"
3105200,3114400," fucking works it works right so this will work we know that it will work it doesn't have to be"
3114400,3118560," elegant or pretty whatever the mathematician came up with it's just it works"
3118560,3124000," fucking works just duct tape that around it freaking works anyway so"
3126240,3130880," uh so if we take a look at these things right so"
3130880,3138800," so these are the values right and then uh right so it's actually different every time because we"
3138800,3144240," randomize the the thing so essentially what we can do after that we can just divide this stuff by like"
3144240,3145200," this right so"
3147200,3152320," it's so it's so good not to be a mathematician because you can do shit like that"
3152320,3156160," under the mathematician i don't know"
3156160,3162000," it works uh right so let's actually see if these failures become from zero to one and they are"
3162000,3167040," look at that they are from zero to one it works so what do you want from me it works"
3168080,3173040," it freaking works uh so"
3173040,3177840," um"
3177840,3184480," i think it is elegant and pretty though it correctly normalizes the discretization of the oh yeah that's"
3184480,3193040," actually true if i used the formula of the area of the circle it would actually be a little bit bigger"
3193040,3197920," because it will include the area it doesn't take into account the quantization and stuff like that"
3197920,3203840," so it will we have this extra like corners that slip in there yeah okay this is even more correct"
3203840,3209600," than using this god damn it that that that engineers won again uh"
3209600,3213760," thank you thank you so much"
3216480,3223680," uh so we got that and essentially what we have to do believe it or not chat we have to plug that thing"
3223680,3232880," into um into this crazy blob like a vendor blob uh that comes with this paper right so the paper"
3232880,3239040," comes with the proprietary blob and we can plug this entire stuff in there so what's interesting is"
3239040,3245040," that there's something that bothers me about this paper right so one of the parameters of this function"
3245040,3254000," is alpha uh everyone can see this alpha right so here is the alpha so it's it's that okay so what do"
3254000,3261360," they say about this alpha uh the width of the step is given by alpha okay so that's the width of the step"
3261360,3268400," whatever the fact step means i don't know as we have two different types of steps we have a end and am"
3270320,3281840," what where is a and the only other place that they mention an and am is at the end of the paper where"
3281840,3287520," they say okay so if you said an and am uh you're gonna get this glider and that's it"
3287520,3295200," it's never mentioned anywhere in the paper it's never mentioned in any of the definitions at all"
3297360,3305760," and it was like i was reading this paper i was just like bruh what the like it's just like"
3305760,3312000," you define some parameters but you never use them you used alpha without the subscript it's just like"
3312000,3323280," what maybe maybe they are referring to something in one of those papers maybe something by the way i i read"
3323280,3331920," some of these papers by the way have you guys seen real life paper have you seen real life so you think"
3331920,3339280," freaking integrals are scary i'm gonna show you real life paper like a real life uh paper"
3341120,3348800," you thought the linear paper is scary look at that just a second uh yeah continuing is larger than life"
3348800,3355360," blah blah blah uh i'm gonna show you something i'm gonna freaking show you all right so just a second"
3355360,3361200," so first of all notice the size of this paper 34 pages right so this is 34 pages i'm gonna actually"
3361200,3366960," zoom in with this so it has to be like it's gonna be white i'm sorry so i'm gonna flash bang you a little"
3366960,3378000," bit but here's the paper this is the 34 pages of this don't worry it gets worse it gets worse 34 pages"
3380400,3388800," i i'm not even sure it's written in english honestly"
3393200,3407040," oh holy"
3407040,3416080," it doesn't stop like that's the funny part it doesn't stop"
3421440,3424720," so we are on the 21st page there's 34 of them"
3424720,3434640," anyway so uh um i'm gonna give the link to this and i think so uh look but personally to be fair"
3434640,3438640," i approve by intimidation yeah it's a proof painting"
3438640,3448080," i personally didn't try to read this paper in all fairness maybe if you try to read it it actually makes"
3448080,3455200," sense right so real life so the thing about linear paper is that it looks a little bit intimidating"
3455200,3461840," right but if you actually sit down and just ponder upon the formulas and definitions and stuff like"
3461840,3468080," that and connect pieces together it makes a lot of sense in fact i managed to understand smooth life paper"
3468080,3474320," way better because i try to read the linear paper first i try to read it follow definition and sort"
3474320,3478880," of like help me to understand like get into the mindset of people who work with these continuous"
3478880,3484240," cell automatons and it helped me to understand this thing better right so just because it looks"
3484240,3490960," intimidating doesn't mean that it is maybe it's incredibly consistent maybe it's so perfect it doesn't"
3490960,3495920," have any logical errors and that if you actually follow through this entire thing it will make"
3495920,3502240," perfect sense the worst part about this kind of stuff is that you may have something extremely"
3502240,3509680," intimidated but at the same time you have errors in here right and because of that you may not even"
3509680,3515520," know that did you not understand something or the author made a mistake and you may never know and"
3515520,3521200," it's just extremely frustrating maybe this paper is so perfect maybe everything is double checked by a"
3521200,3526160," computer by the cox system you know the proof assistant and stuff like that it's so perfect"
3526160,3530080," if you just like sit down and follow it it makes perfect sense i don't know i never tried that"
3530080,3537280," so so basically yeah so i'm just saying that it just because it looks intimidated doesn't mean that"
3537280,3541760," it's impossible to understand it just like depends on on the quality of this thing but i don't know the"
3541760,3544080," quality of this thing uh right"
3544080,3551920," cock assistant"
3551920,3562000," uh i meant uh cook oh yeah this thing yeah so it's a it's a proof assistant it's not a cock assistant"
3562000,3569040," it's a basically thing where you can write theorems and prove them automatically it's actually a pretty"
3569040,3577840," cool thing uh so i want to learn it properly uh at some point in the future all right uh so yeah let me"
3577840,3584720," actually put this thing uh in here cock assistant okay so this is a cock assistant"
3584720,3594320," learning cock so to be fair the the this language has a very cool clickbait value right so you can just put"
3594320,3606000," learning cock in the title and everyone ahaha cock ah i'm 13 oh funny funny so it works um all right"
3606000,3612400," so we're doing that for an hour already so i would like to make a small break because i need want to"
3612400,3617600," make a cup of tea and after a small break and after i make a cup of tea we're gonna continue and we're gonna"
3617600,3624720," we're gonna try to actually like fit these two values into this proprietary blob and see where it"
3624720,3633200," will take us so yeah up so uh let's go ahead and try to implement that monstrosity of a function right"
3633200,3641040," so where is my sigmoid uh so this is the first sigmoid so we have a sigma one and sigma two right and"
3641040,3649680," sigma two is defined in terms of sigma one and we also have sigma m and we also need to define sigma balls"
3649680,3657120," all right"
3657120,3660240," um"
3663760,3671360," so we have sigma m uh right and s the the transition function is already defined in terms"
3671360,3680080," of i guess not really all of them but sigma two and sigma m right so let's first code the sigma one"
3680080,3686000," right so i think that makes sense so this is going to be sigma one i'm going to even split my screen"
3687200,3696080," in two so it's easier to to copy paste stuff so this is a sigma one it accepts x and it accepts a and it's"
3696080,3703440," also parameterized by alpha right so and i suppose and i hope this is not a typer right so because you"
3703440,3710080," have a and alpha i really hope that it's not a typer so they didn't confuse this kind of stuff though if"
3710080,3716880," they used later right if they used later uh if you want to type a you will just type a and if you"
3716880,3721440," want to type alpha you would have to do something like this so it's kind of difficult to put alpha"
3721440,3727040," accidentally if you know what i mean right unless it's a logical error but i doubt there's any logical"
3727040,3732560," errors in here at least like obvious ones except this part with alpha n and alpha m i'm not really"
3732560,3736880," sure what the fuck is those things and how they're supposed to be used but i don't know maybe uh"
3736880,3741440," people who understand this paper better can point out like what the fuck they mean by these things but"
3741440,3750000," i couldn't understand that so um right i feel like alpha n and alpha m refers to the things that you can"
3750000,3758640," plug in here but when do i plug alpha n and when do i plug alpha m the paper still doesn't kind of answer"
3758640,3764720," that question so i'm gonna basically assume that there's only one alpha right so and we can always"
3764720,3771040," play with those parameters and see how all of that goes obviously um okay so let's actually start with"
3771040,3781440," exp exp uh my don't decrease that much please minus x minus a multiplied by four and divided by alpha"
3781440,3787920," right hopefully that's uh how it's supposed to go right so that's basically we wanted it actually makes"
3787920,3795040," sense right so and then we want to divide all of that uh you know one by by all of that like so"
3795040,3803920," let me go so that's basically sigmoid that's essentially sigmoid um so it would be kind of"
3803920,3811360," interesting to look into that sigmoid right so this is the alpha and the alpha if i'm not mistaken right alpha"
3812320,3820320," we can pick one of this alpha in here so one of them is um 0 28 right so this is alpha n"
3820320,3828400," and the alpha m is 147 but i'm not really sure which one we have to use so it's kind of uh right"
3828400,3834960," so alpha is the abruptness of the change of the sigmoid all right but why do we have two of them"
3835520,3842240," right and how do we plug alpha n alpha m into the sigmoids so i don't really know still um"
3842240,3854160," this is a good point wait a second uh i think alpha uh alpha n is used in the n integral and alpha m is"
3854160,3864720," used in m integral but but we don't use uh sigmoids in an in an integral we just don't"
3865280,3872000," so we first compute m and m we normalize them from zero to one and then we plug them into s"
3872000,3876560," which accepts both n and m and that's it so"
3876560,3887280," i don't know equations one one and two i don't think it makes sense to me right i didn't i didn't"
3887280,3894080," see where a sigma plays a role in here there's no sigma in here f if i understand correctly it's basically"
3894080,3900800," the state of the of the grid right it's the state of the grid at particular point at particular time"
3900800,3904400," so there's no sigma in here so it's just like we just sum those things up"
3904400,3915120," uh sigma n and sigma m and here's the thing there is only sigma m there's only sigma m there's no sigma n"
3915120,3923680," defined anywhere anything so that's the problem like i read this paper i don't understand where"
3923680,3924480," the common place"
3924480,3934800," so yeah because of that i'm going to uh you can always read this paper by the way it's it's very small and uh"
3934800,3941520," uh feel free to read it and point out like what is sigma n and sigma m to me i freaking know"
3941520,3950880," uh so if they literally just used alpha n and alpha m somewhere here in the definitions it would have"
3950880,3951680," made sense to me"
3951680,3959920," there's no sigma n anywhere like guys you're talking about sigma n there's no sigma n that's the problem"
3959920,3966480," there's no sigma n at least i didn't see it uh so i think chat just like okay people who tell me"
3966480,3974160," things did you read the whole paper first or are you just like yeah whatever uh sigma there's no such"
3974160,3979280," thing sigma one okay so there is a sigma one there is sigma m there's no such thing as sigma n it"
3979280,3986480," literally does not exist in the entire paper it's just it's another thing it's not a thing in the paper"
3986480,3992640," there is sigma m it's mentioned three times there's no sigma n so"
3992640,4000080," that's the problem that's what i'm talking about guys that's exactly what i'm talking about it's"
4000080,4007600," confusing what the fuck is going on i don't know maybe i'm dumb right uh my guess is sigma 2 is"
4007600,4013920," supposed to see and probably that's a good guess so that means um there is a mistake in a paper"
4013920,4019680," right is there any way to see like is there a rata date or something like that i know that"
4019680,4026160," rfc have a rata section where like you can submit things and stuff like that is there something"
4026160,4033200," like that in here probably not right uh a rata section in there in rfc is actually very useful"
4033200,4038880," right so when you're reading the rfc and you notice some you can just open or always open the rata and"
4038880,4044720," there will be something there that actually could like explain that the rata for paper is usually another"
4044720,4045680," paper oh yeah okay"
4050400,4057680," actually i never wrote uh scientific papers i think well i mean technically i i did because that's"
4057680,4064160," what was part of what like studying in university meant but i mean i never took it seriously it was"
4064160,4075840," never anything useful so i think yo i think i remember i think one of the one of my open source"
4075840,4086240," repos were referenced in a scientific paper i think yeah let me actually find that so one of the repos in"
4086240,4095120," uh odsonian organization it was in a camel and it was uh con for convex school convex yeah convex"
4095120,4102800," school uh so essentially what i did here i implemented the convex hole algorithm in ocamil right and it was"
4102800,4112240," uh seven years ago by the way so it was seven years ago i implemented this entire thing uh and somebody"
4112240,4119120," referenced this thing in a scientific paper uh where we they were trying to automatically i think"
4119120,4124560," parallelize functional programming algorithms and this is the only functional style convex"
4124560,4133760," whole implementation that they could find right so because it's a convex whole whole but it's implemented"
4133760,4139600," in the functional style uh so because seven years ago i was really into functional programming and that's"
4139600,4146560," what i literally did so yeah so that that's basically it's in a pure functional programming style i wonder if"
4146560,4159920," we can find that thing uh sodding convex oh my god why dr go is so slow"
4159920,4162880," maybe"
4162880,4168080," i wonder if there was some"
4169920,4179040," um what is the google service called for papers uh google oh you you you got oh you found that thank"
4179040,4184400," you thank you so much it was about to i think google scholar yeah i thought maybe i can uh search for"
4184400,4192880," for google scholar yeah yeah so let's actually download pdf can we download pdf yeah boy yeah boy perfection"
4192880,4199840," function function languages and if you search for sodding uh yeah look at that github.com sodding convex"
4199840,4204960," who but it's actually refers to agner fog instruction i don't know what the hell is that it's actually i"
4204960,4211600," think i was mentioned like twice in there because the yeah so this is the proper uh credit right so sodding"
4211600,4221600," 2015 comics cool uh right so isn't that cool i i have nothing to do with uh you know scientific world with"
4221600,4226640," computer science or anything like that i was just like i'm just shit posting on the internet right"
4226640,4232640," so i was just doing things on the internet and it was just like uh sighting here how did you learn about"
4232640,4243600," that i think somebody who read this paper took to went to this repo and then found our discord server and"
4243600,4249760," they joined the discord server and they asked questions about this paper they i think they thought we had"
4249760,4255840," something to do with that paper because we were actually like uh quoted in there or something this"
4255840,4260080," is how we found out that's so cool"
4260080,4267680," uh right it's kind of kind of strange like i would never expect something like that to happen but"
4267680,4275360," apparently i was the only one like who implemented convex hull algorithm in a purely functional style and"
4275360,4282320," they needed that for their testing for their technique of pre-fetching that supposed to speed up uh the"
4282320,4287200," pure functional programming algorithms right so they were basically researching that so if we if you"
4287200,4292880," program in the pure functional uh style can you get the same like performance as like you know imperative"
4292880,4297440," style so they were just basically developing techniques for for speeding up this kind of stuff right"
4298320,4307520," uh so yeah that's actually kind of quick yo am i a scientist what the did you read the paper no i'm"
4307520,4312400," not a nerd why would i read that maybe i should by the way maybe i'll i'll read it at some point"
4312400,4317840," uh maybe i can make a stream about like this kind of stuff and just looking into this technique"
4324640,4334080," um implementing functional convex hull uh is a post for me yes because that's what i used to do for fun"
4334080,4338640," seven years ago and it's just like yeah i would just take a random thing and just implement it in"
4338640,4345040," a pure functional style because haha funny function applications just for me it's a post uh i don't"
4345040,4353520," know i still do not take it seriously to be fair um for me functional programming pure functional programming"
4353520,4362160," is still programming in a funny way right it's just like uh you're doing funny things okay tom cass"
4362160,4367360," thank you so much for twitch prime suggestion thank you thank you thank you fp stands for funny programming"
4367360,4377120," exactly exactly anyways anyways so uh let's actually continue and uh we are implement we were implementing"
4377120,4388720," sigma balls uh right and we've got this entire thing so let's go with a sigma two right float x float a float b"
4388720,4401280," right so and uh what are we doing here we use sigma one uh one x a and multiply by an inverse of a sigma one"
4401280,4407200," so it's basically uh it's a derivative of sigma uh one but it's actually not particularly derivative"
4407200,4411840," because this is a different sigma the derivative of sigma one would be actually something like this but"
4411840,4416800," if since we put b in here uh it's not particularly derivative so yeah"
4416800,4426640," so it's something else it is something else okay so this sigma two uh and uh the next one is going to be"
4426640,4439440," sigma m uh and this one accepts uh x y and m right so this one is a little bit more complicated uh so we"
4439440,4448400," take x multiplied by an inverse of sigma one m half right so then we know what that means but then m multiplied by"
4448960,4460960," uh sigma sigma sigma sigma sigma one m05 hope i didn't make any typos in here uh-huh"
4460960,4468240," it looks good i suppose this is literally the same thing right so this is literally the same thing and"
4468240,4477760," this is sort of like an inverse of this entire stuff okay so that looks okay okay and float s this is the final"
4477760,4489600," thing uh the final boss of the proprietary function uh sigma two uh n sigma m b1 d1 m so and as far as"
4489600,4499120," you know b1 uh b1 b2 d1 d2 are the birth and death intervals uh of this entire thing so at particular"
4499120,4504720," intervals you basically become either dead or alive and stuff like that and it's kind of corresponds to"
4505280,4511440," uh like a generalization of the conveys game of live rules right if that makes any sense uh"
4511440,4520560," right so b2 and d2 and effectively we just return this entire thing right so we just return this entire"
4520560,4528720," thing and we need to define the parameters b1 b2 d1 d2 and they are given at the end of the paper yet again"
4528720,4535600," with all of these parameters in here so we can just use those parameters uh right b1 b2 d1 d2 so we're"
4535600,4544000," going to put them in here right so b1 uh 0278 uh so i suppose these parameters they literally played"
4544000,4551200," with the parameters and like tweak them around and just found the ones that look okay-ish uh right okay-ish"
4551200,4562800," enough for a paper uh and uh d2 i suppose is 445 right so that's basically all of the parameters"
4562800,4570320," right so we have a radius we have the death and birth intervals and we have some sort of alpha right so but"
4570320,4575840," we still don't know what is alpha n and alpha m right so it's kind of kind of weird thing if we by the"
4575840,4581280," end of today's stream if we manage to see this little thing i'm gonna call it an epic win right"
4581280,4586640," so i'm not sure if all of that shit is going to work but if we at least see the glimpses of this thing"
4586640,4595760," that's an epic win right okay so all right so let me try to compile this entire thing uh is it going to"
4595760,4601120," work okay so it wants a mathematical stuff so that means we need to include math right so we're including"
4601120,4606560," math and also we need to link with math you need to think like math you need to link with math"
4606560,4613360," there we go so this is what we got that's pretty epic okay so we have this mathematical function"
4613360,4625040," and we can kind of feed that shit into into this thing now right so if i do s uh and m right so s and m"
4627040,4637280," and this is going to be effectively equal to that s and m so the order is n m right so the order is n m"
4637280,4645920," that's kind of yeah that's weird okay i hope there's no mistakes in here right i really hope so and it's"
4645920,4653760," zero i suppose this is because well sometimes it's okay so sometimes it's something sometimes it is zero"
4653760,4659120," sometimes it's something right i'm really glad that it's not always zero right"
4659120,4668320," okay so one of the things we can do one of the things we can do"
4668320,4676000," we want to compute this stuff for each individual point of the grid right for each individual point"
4676000,4682080," so that means we need to generalize this entire thing uh so how are we going to be computing this entire"
4682080,4691120," stuff uh so yeah let me see let me see let me see let me see so maybe uh so"
4696480,4710240," grid div and maybe we're going to have this thing as literally like a second grid in here right that's"
4710240,4718400," actually sounds like a very interesting idea so uh this is going to be grid div uh right and we can say"
4718400,4726480," compute compute compute grid div and in here what we need to do we need to just like do this entire"
4726480,4734320," thing for each individual point so uh we're going to wrap this entire stuff to a loop uh right so but"
4734320,4742400," here the parameters of loop are going to be cx and cy so we're going to do uh int cy uh zero less than height"
4742400,4751200," so that's the first sort of layer of the loop and then uh cx less than width uh plus plus cx there we"
4751200,4758640," go so i'm just close this entire thing and uh then we're going to close this entire loop completely"
4758640,4764400," right so and we are basically doing that for each individual thing in here uh right and inside of this"
4764400,4772080," thing we're going to be calling um so once we're done with this thing we can do s n and m"
4772560,4782000," and we can apply it to grid div right we can apply it to grid div for uh c y cx right for c y cx we can"
4782000,4788000," just put it in here um and what i want to do i want to actually print this entire thing right so we"
4788000,4794160," already have a function called display grid but it's actually hard coded to accept that global grid in"
4794160,4798960," there right so that global grid in there so maybe what i want to do in here i want to actually accept"
4799680,4806560," uh sort of like any grid of height and width yes i know that it's going to decay into a point to a"
4806560,4813600," grid and not an actual array i do that intentionally for documentation purpose right i know i know i know"
4813600,4823920," i know i know because there are people like that gonna be i know i know i know i do that intentionally"
4823920,4827920," because i've seen that too many times i'm sorry"
4831760,4839760," so um right and in here what i want to do is essentially um"
4839760,4848240," i'm gonna put the grid in here right so i'm just gonna uh run this into i think uh right and that's"
4848240,4854240," basically the state of the grid right so this is the state of the grid so what we can do we can do"
4854240,4862000," compute grid div right so we're computing grid div and we want to display uh grid div after that and"
4862000,4868800," we're going to be using the same trick uh we're going to use the same trick for displaying the continuous"
4868800,4875120," value of this thing right so let's see if it actually produces anything uh it's taking the the values are"
4875120,4882080," rather small right so they're not really telling us that much right so because i presume they are too"
4882080,4888560," small uh one other thing i want to do in here right so i want to make it like 10 right so something like 10"
4888560,4896320," and uh let's actually display them as floats right because maybe they're so small there is no point"
4896320,4901680," in displaying them like an actual things right so because that's what it feels like it is to me right"
4901680,4910480," so let's take a look at their actual values in here right so size t x zero x less than width plus plus x"
4910480,4923200," f and uh grid div y x hope i didn't do any oopsie doopsie and potential if i keep looking okay"
4923200,4931280," so we probably want to put space in here and then a new line there and let's see what"
4931280,4935120," we'll get they're really small deliver to know they're super small"
4935120,4942960," that's very interesting so yeah"
4942960,4950320," let's take a look at what people say uh i've been reading implementation in matlab that uses"
4950320,4956880," those sigmoid function and it looks like they use use alpha n and alpha n in sigmoid 2 and sigma m"
4957440,4963200," respectively could you please point at the uh matlab implementation somehow so"
4963200,4969840," um i would like to take a look and i really want to know is that a mistake in the paper"
4969840,4977760," is that a mistake in the paper or it's just like i cannot interpret that properly it's just like so weird"
4978560,4981200," uh because it's like confusing and misleading"
4981200,4985840," so i don't know"
4985840,4994800," uh okay so and what essentially you can do uh it's only so oh you have to download it yeah"
4994800,5005760," okay so this is sort of like one of the implementations right we can take a look at it if we don't manage to"
5005760,5012080," come up with something working there's also python version that does the same thing huh"
5012080,5018880," weird okay so we can try the actual thing in here right that is written in a paper right that is"
5018880,5025280," written in the paper and then if it doesn't work out we may take a look at the smooth life implementation"
5025280,5026880," right so somewhere here right"
5026880,5033680," okay so let's continue let's continue all right"
5033680,5043520," so one of the things we want to do so we also define a delta time right we also define a delta time"
5043520,5048880," so basically the time stamp this time step that we use to simulate this into i think i wonder"
5049600,5057600," do they specify their time step um so the smooth glider they don't really they don't really specify"
5057600,5065200," their time step so it's okay i guess so for now i'm going to specify it as just like one right and we"
5065200,5073680," can increase it in the future right so we can increase it in the future um so the way you're supposed to"
5073680,5078640," update your grid the way you're supposed to update if i'm not mistaken is just like grid"
5078640,5087600," uh y x right plus multiplied by dt right so that's basically what you have to do and i think they even"
5087600,5092800," mention it yeah there we go so that's basically the formula which that's basically what it means"
5093440,5099760," but if you want to do it like that you actually have to remap the value s uh from the range from zero to"
5099760,5106560," one to the range of uh from minus one to one so multiply by two and like this and this is something"
5106560,5116880," we can try to do automatically uh in the compute grid diffing here right so we can basically assign"
5116880,5124400," like a value in here so let's call it q uh right and when we're assigning the diff we're gonna do two q"
5124400,5132080," minus one right so that's basically what they want us to do in here right specifically in here so that"
5132080,5141600," makes sense uh to me and that makes it super easy to just do this kind of stuff right so okay let's try to"
5141600,5149600," display the grid so this is going to be the grid this is our grid so we compute the um the grid diff"
5149600,5156800," then we sort of apply the grid diff and we may want to take a look at the next state afterwards since"
5156800,5163200," the diffs are so small i feel like it's not going to be visible right away on the second iteration if"
5163200,5170960," you know what i mean right so uh let me see if it's going to to work okay so it became what the"
5170960,5183600," fuck is this what the fuck um how it's okay so it over flew apparently it over flew apparently do we have"
5183600,5195920," to clamp yeah okay so this one is kind of dangerous right because i feel like the result of addition has to"
5195920,5208160," be clamped to zero and one um but it's not really mentioned in here because the the values of the uh"
5208160,5214160," of the cells are supposed to be from zero to one what do we think should be clamped what's big s i also"
5214160,5220880," don't know this is the second thing that i couldn't understand right so they say if we think of the"
5220880,5230480," application of snm as non-linear operator s we can write this what is s it's just like they say it like"
5230480,5235360," it should be obvious what s it's a non-linear operator like bruh like it's just like it's a"
5235360,5241360," non-linear they never define it in the paper either by the way they never define it out so"
5242400,5252720," so this paper has two mysteries for me it's alpha n versus alpha m and big s"
5252720,5258960," it's just a name okay cool i understand that it's just a name but which non-linear operator can you"
5258960,5265840," show an example of what kind of like what exactly do you mean by that it's just like what uh calculate"
5265840,5272160," ascent for every point with the old function value then set it to the new value yeah i guess"
5272160,5279040," so does it want me to put a sigmoid in there or or what like it's just"
5279040,5286320," i don't know another mathematician i just asked your gpt you won't believe"
5286320,5292320," i did it couldn't come up with a proper answer either so we couldn't understand what"
5292320,5297680," the f it's talking about as well so right uh"
5297680,5310000," big s is simply a function which gets you from x to a small s and f of x okay"
5310000,5317120," oh okay this one this one makes more sense"
5319680,5328000," this one kind of makes sense actually the sum of yeah smaller s's so yeah if s is something small"
5328000,5335040," but then and i don't know man it's like weird and confusing it is weird and confusing"
5335040,5341920," so i'm gonna just assume that you can basically multiply it by that like so and this can be can"
5341920,5349520," be fine um so let me let me see what kind of stuff we get in here uh right so"
5349680,5365680," yeah so there we go and all of them are zero that doesn't make any sense"
5365680,5373680," because i didn't do grid y grid x uh okay and they became instantly negative"
5375840,5383440," which is kind of sus not gonna lie so if i take a look at the grid div uh in here"
5383440,5391120," right if i take a look at the grid div in here uh they are yeah so they mapped really badly in here"
5393120,5411280," uh so that's really strange and okay in that case that makes sense to have a very small dt"
5411280,5418160," right around like one because in that case if you multiply by that small dt"
5419040,5425120," if you multiply by that small dt uh all right so that's what you're subtracting actually"
5425120,5428800," right so that's what you're subtracting and if you take a look at this thing"
5428800,5436400," it makes sense more or less so but i feel like we still need to clamp this thing right so one of the"
5436400,5443360," things i would like to do is just clamp it to to this kind of stuff can i have something like i remember"
5443360,5449440," that john quite often defines a function clamp which actually accepts the pointer of this thing that you"
5449440,5457760," want to clamp which i found very useful right i think it's a it does in fact make sense to to do it"
5457760,5465120," like that so we have a value and then you have lower and high right and essentially if x is lower than l"
5465680,5473200," it becomes l and then if it's higher than h it becomes h so that's the whole thing and it's just"
5473200,5477520," like to be fair like clamp that modifies this thing like a little bit easier to use"
5477520,5486400," uh but they say it's from minus one to one who from minus one to one uh the function f"
5488240,5497520," so yeah so we redefine s to be from um where we have defined a new s that has values in the range"
5497520,5503200," from minus one to one instead of zero one is a translation function yeah so i think that's what"
5503200,5509680," we want to do let's give it a try uh let's give it a try so okay"
5509680,5521680," okay did we get something i think it changed"
5521680,5529200," but we don't see the new line anywhere so let me put this kind of thing"
5530960,5535840," okay it changed look at that it literally changed so there was this thing and now it's"
5535840,5544320," completely different okay so let me try the following thing i'm gonna make this size of this"
5544320,5554560," stuff bigger uh maybe not that big but uh we can make 20 by 20 and let's try around maybe 10"
5554560,5560720," iterations 10 iterations by the way in a compute grid diff do we reset yeah we do"
5560720,5565920," reset this entire thing so i don't need to clean anything up uh right so and let's try to"
5565920,5574640," like do this 10 times right can we do that 10 times compute grid diff apply grid diff and display"
5574640,5580080," grid diff so maybe this thing should be a separate operation as well if you know what i mean right"
5580080,5588640," maybe it should be a separate operation as well and okay it was just like you know blinking or something"
5588640,5593920," like that like that i wonder if i can make dt even smaller is it going to let's do something"
5593920,5602400," all right so let me go uh let me go to here all right"
5602400,5614480," cool and maybe one of the things we want to try uh one of the things we want to try we actually want to"
5614480,5618400," make it infinite right so let's actually go indefinitely and see how it's going to go"
5618400,5622560," maybe it will do something uh yeah i just wanted to"
5622560,5625440," all right"
5625440,5629120," is it doing something"
5629120,5632880," the fuck i think it's doing something"
5635040,5636320," it turned into square"
5636320,5645760," that's cool uh well it started doing i mean that's already something uh what about like making this"
5645760,5653680," entire bigger like 100 by 100 right but i feel like it's just like it's not gonna"
5655920,5662880," and it's taking too much time to maybe this is because the um um"
5662880,5669520," the neighborhood is too big right i don't know why it takes so much time to"
5669520,5674560," let's actually try to optimize like all three maybe that's what we need to do"
5684240,5691840," okay"
5691840,5709680," oh this is magic like holy why are they not moving though"
5711680,5714080," uh they're kind of moving but they're settling at"
5714080,5722160," something is that basically smooth life also it's not really squarish right so it's not really"
5722160,5732080," squarish uh one of the things i may want to try to do um okay so when i display the grid let's"
5732080,5742080," actually print it twice right so maybe twice what if i use fputc instead of printf so maybe that will"
5742080,5748800," speed it up a little bit because i know maybe printf is too slow right and well this is supposed to be"
5750800,5760400," let's get out here i'm sure it's gonna affect anything uh right so i want to make it sort of squarish"
5761280,5771280," you know what i mean"
5771280,5775760," so it just it creates static structures"
5775760,5787760," which i'm not really happy about um so what's the size of the uh of the radius so can we just make it like"
5787760,5790640," 11 and what if we make it smaller"
5790640,5799760," that's okay that's very cool smaller radius"
5799760,5805120," actually creates this kind of it does look like original thing but it's"
5806240,5813440," not really doing anything interesting right okay one of the things i want to try uh when i do a random"
5813440,5818560," grid let's actually not initialize the whole grid let's initialize like a half of the grid"
5818560,5823920," uh right so what if we initialize half of the grid uh okay"
5828080,5830400," it's kind of expanding it's kind of expanding it's kind of doing things"
5830400,5835920," this is is that a glider or something"
5835920,5846560," okay can we make it move faster what's the dt dt is might be actually too small uh let's make it bigger"
5848560,5853440," um"
5853440,5857520," it's it's it's moving i think we have something moving in here"
5857520,5860880," like a glider or something it's a stable structure that is moving"
5863520,5864160," well i mean it's"
5864160,5872320," this is so cool holy shit what the"
5872320,5874800," did we do it"
5874800,5883360," and and then it goes into this like a stable state and it's just sort of dies out"
5885920,5897360," that's so cool that is so cool holy shit uh right so okay what if i initialize that with even smaller"
5897360,5901200," thing what if i initialize that with even smaller thing"
5901200,5911280," this is a good this is this is a glider oh it starts to divide into two when"
5915920,5930080," this is a glider oh it starts to divide into two when it goes into two when it goes into this stuff"
5930080,5936160," and it goes into this stuff"
5940800,5946240," uh so but the original thing had uh radio 21"
5946240,5949680," all right it had a radio 21 so"
5949680,5956960," uh in this case it actually just dies out so it's kind of like a too much for our small thingy"
5956960,5960720," what if i change the alpha right so what if we use the the different alpha"
5960720,5964800," yeah it didn't work out"
5966160,5971760," um random where's the random let's do half"
5971760,5975200," okay"
5975200,5987600," all right i suppose this combination of parameters kind of worked this combination of parameters kind of"
5991760,5998080," and it created interesting structures you know what i would like to do probably uh actually maybe"
5998080,6004800," center this entire thing somehow so we can just do something like width which is"
6004800,6011200," this thing divided by two and height divided by two as well right and"
6011200,6020080," let's say that i'm gonna be iterating through this entire stuff but this is gonna be not"
6020080,6031840," y it's a d y and d x d y d x d x right so in an actual uh x and y is going to be basically x"
6031840,6038960," uh half of the width half of the width minus half of that thing so it's going to be sort of like"
6038960,6044400," centered so we can see because it's done on the edge it's done on the edge and so it's kind of difficult"
6044400,6049040," to see what the hell is going on in there all right so you know what i mean you know what i mean"
6049040,6058800," so let's actually try to do something like this so uh yep yep yep it didn't do shite the fuck um excuse me"
6058800,6063200," so i suppose it has to be actually"
6063200,6064720," uh"
6064720,6071920," yeah minus dx dx plus and dy plus this entire thing okay"
6073440,6077840," so let me let me see there we go so it's at the center at least"
6077840,6084560," now we can see that from the center and i want to keep making it smaller maybe uh right what if i"
6084560,6089600," divide that by four so this is going to be like fourth of this entire thing we could try to maybe"
6089600,6091040," initialize that with a circle"
6091040,6100240," so yeah maybe circle would have been actually very interesting"
6100240,6106080," but how can we even do this kind of thing we can just iterate"
6107440,6112000," uh the entire thing uh the entire thing so this is going to be three"
6112000,6121440," so did it recompile actually i don't think so"
6128160,6133760," it's two of them stuck together"
6133760,6139520," and they're moving so i suppose it's uh you basically need to come up with the parameters that"
6139520,6144400," make it just like more stable because i want to be able to see like a single things in there"
6145120,6146160," uh right"
6146160,6153440," but it does look like the simulations like the animations i've seen online"
6153440,6157760," it does in fact look like one of the simulations that i've seen online"
6157760,6162960," and once it gets into that state it's just like pointless to do anything it's just it's a very stable"
6162960,6169360," state of this entire thing some things may actually happen in here some things are actually"
6169360,6173520," happening in here but it's kind of difficult to get out of that state you know what i mean"
6174240,6181680," right so and maybe it would be nice to maybe get like a correct implementation because i was just"
6181680,6186240," following the paper as it was written as i understood this paper"
6186240,6190720," right as i understood this paper i don't know if i'm just"
6190720,6197360," smooth-brained like this game of life just it's a smooth life maybe my brain is as smooth as this life"
6197360,6203200," or there are some mistakes and typos in this paper so i don't really know so"
6205120,6211520," uh so if whoever watches that maybe like on youtube in the future maybe just like in the chat tell me that"
6211520,6218160," what kind of mistakes i've made so it's kind of important for me to know like is that my mistake"
6218160,6223440," is it me who's being dumb or is something wrong with the paper right but at the end of the day it"
6223440,6229120," kind of worked out if you just plug these things into this thing uh it does in fact create these kind"
6229120,6236080," of cool structures uh right so but i'm too dumb to understand why and how to do that thing properly but"
6236080,6243520," i tried and it's actually fun right so should i more do more of this kind of series where i just like take"
6243520,6250480," some paper uh and just try to implement that uh not something that is difficult to implement i definitely"
6250480,6255360," won't be able to implement the uh the sparks of general intelligence right because i don't have"
6255360,6262400," hardware for this kind of but you know what i mean uh right project or research i think i already done that"
6262400,6270080," but i don't know so yeah right so let's actually do a committee committee uh right so"
6270080,6277360," so this is basically my interpretation so i'm gonna release it under mit uh and by the way i'm gonna"
6277360,6282560," actually like put that on the github feel free to submit pull request and in pull request explain me"
6282560,6288480," uh what i got wrong and please also tell me is that me being dumb or is that something wrong with the"
6288480,6296240," paper and if it's me being dumb please tell me where they refer properly to alpha n and alpha m right"
6296240,6303760," so it's just like it's it bothers me so freaking much it's just like i don't understand yeah"
6304880,6314080," so uh read me uh okay so this is a smooth life implementation by the smooth life implementation"
6314080,6322160," in c right so this is going to be quick start and the quick start is very simple right so i didn't"
6322160,6330240," over complicate anything build.sh uh and then you just run this entire thing all right and then we can do"
6330240,6337360," references right so the references and references basically this paper right so we used only this"
6337360,6342880," paper we didn't cheat or anything we didn't look up any of the existing solutions i just follow this paper"
6343600,6356240," uh okay uh all right so and let me do git ignore i want to get ignored the main there we go and can i do git"
6356240,6365840," it right so ready set i go"
6365840,6378240," yo what if i implement smooth life in a purely functional style would i get credited in another five hat scientific"
6378240,6392720," paper yo easy easy citations farming citations just like taking all of the like you know famous algorithm"
6392720,6399280," and just implemented them in a purely functional style and you just farm and just farming citations easy"
6399280,6412800," i don't know what it's like i don't know but i don't know what it's like i don't know what it's like"
6412800,6414800," i don't know what it's like you don't know what it's like i don't know what it's like"
6414800,6419040," oh that's what it's called i was trying to remember like there there was a some sort of like a metric for"
6419040,6426400," for for how good of a scientist you are uh for how many people you managed to debate to to read your"
6426400,6437440," paper uh smooth life okay so right so smooth life implementation in c so this is going to be public"
6437440,6446320," of course we're not gate keeping right we're making everything public uh and i'm going to what what what"
6446320,6454160," i'm going to git remote add origin and this and i i thought i copy pasted this into i think i said"
6454160,6465440," copy paste let's go and let's push that right into the repo right into the repo is it pushed is it"
6465440,6473600," it's not even pushed yet come on you can do that all right so here it is here's the result of today's"
6473600,6480080," stream uh so let me go to the description so this is the source code there we go"
6480080,6486080," that's pretty cool uh let me take a look at that one one time so that's the result of it"
6486080,6500000," it was one of the first it was glider and then it was a pulsar or thingy like that it it was actually the"
6500000,6508000," thing the legend i heard the legend about the structures yes well what's interesting that it"
6508000,6516640," forms these strips and all the strips feel like basically several uh several gliders stuck together"
6516640,6521360," side by side does it feel like it because it's it basically consists of these gliders that's what it does"
6522320,6524480," right it's kind of weird right"
6524480,6531760," well this one doesn't really work out wow this one is interesting actually what is gonna like blow up"
6531760,6539840," it's gonna be single this is a single glitter but they're not stable there's not stable enough i think"
6539840,6544640," we need to come up with with a set of parameters that actually makes this entire stuff stable"
6545440,6552880," right yeah so here you can see so the two gliders like trying to separate from each other but as they"
6552880,6558880," as they separate they actually multiply right as they try to separate they actually multiply and at"
6558880,6563600," some point they get into the state where we're just like stuck and there's only strips of just like"
6563600,6573600," this stuff uh yeah all right okay so i think i need to acknowledge all of the people who were throwing"
6573600,6579840," money at me uh so i think i already acknowledged tom cass i thank you so much paul octavian i hope i"
6579840,6584320," pronounced you and i'm correctly thank you so much for tier one and above par nonsense thank you so much for"
6584320,6589920," twitch prime thank you thank you everyone i'm already streaming for two hours and this is usually my usual"
6589920,6595680," time uh for streaming so i guess uh that's gonna be it for today today was actually fun stream"
6595680,6604160," right uh i actually didn't like the only thing i did before the stream i just tried to understand the"
6604160,6608000," paper right it was trying to understand the paper i didn't really know if it's gonna work out or not"
6608000,6614640," right i just want you to see what's gonna happen if i just like code it as i understood it right and i was"
6614640,6618640," kind of skeptical to be fair at the beginning because i didn't understand some of the things i didn't"
6618640,6623360," understand the alpha thing and i didn't understand the linear operator but i'm surprised it just like"
6623360,6629200," produced something i'm surprised it produced something well that dies out of course right so"
6629200,6638560," all right yo this is a glider and it's dead okay all right that's it for today thanks everyone who's"
6638560,6651440," watching me right now i really appreciate it have a good one and see you in the next time love you"
6664960,6694940," Thank you."
