0,6400," looks like we're live hello everyone are we wait we're alive right looks like we're live hello"
6400,13200," everyone and welcome to yet another recreation programming session with mr azuzin uh let's make"
13200,18720," a little bit of announcement and officially start the stream as usual so right circle live on twitch"
18720,26720," what are we doing today on twitch.tv television website today we are reviewing your pull requests"
26720,30960," uh that's right i'm going to give the link to twitch.tv/serving the place where we do know that"
30960,36400," and of course i'm going to ping everyone who's interested in being pinged and there you go the"
36400,42400," stream has officially started the stream has officially started so uh today i would like"
42400,47680," to take a look at the pull request that people submitted to raylib.js experimental project that"
47680,54080," we started uh several streams ago right so it's an official implementation of subset of raylib api"
54080,60880," in javascript right so um essentially the goal of this thing is to be like a one file javascript"
60880,68480," implementation of the raylib api that can be called from web assembly and uh it does not depend on mscript"
68480,74800," and or any other over complicated setups or anything like that just like literally single file that you"
74800,81520," include into your project you take your game written in c you compile that game to web assembly and uh then"
81520,87440," using this raylib.js you will be able to load that web assembly module and actually execute it on on a"
87440,94960," web page right so that's basically the goal uh and of course this approach is very much limited it is very"
94960,102400," much limited uh but it is simple right and that's my goal my goal is to explore the ways to do simplicity"
102400,107680," and stuff like that so and i also said that this uh project is open for pull requests and people submitted"
107680,112480," quite a few pull requests so and that's exactly what i wanted to do today i want you to go through"
112480,118240," the pull request and review them maybe merge some of them provide the feedback and stuff like that right"
118240,123520," so that's basically the goal for today's stream that's basically the goal for today's stream so uh let's"
123520,129280," take a look at them uh let's take a look at them uh so okay we have uh 12 pull requests i think i'm"
129280,134400," going to start from the bottom right so i'm going to start from the bottom in order as people were"
134400,141840," submitting the pull request i think it's fair so uh selected example to url search path okay so this is"
141840,151280," actually uh the problem that i had for some time right so let's actually maybe start the server uh http"
151280,161120," http server 6969 uh 6969 right and let's actually go here so one of the problems that i had okay so we"
161120,168880," already have a dark mode so uh i'm not using any dark reader or anything like that but i'm actually using"
169440,177600," chrome flags uh and yeah so basically out a dark mode for web content so this is experimental flag"
177600,182960," and it actually works quite well it works faster than a darker reader because it's probably built"
182960,189440," into the browser itself right on the level of c plus plus so that's why it is faster and uh yeah now we"
189440,197440," have a dark mode i remember somebody even submitted like a pull request excuse me for the dark mode uh yeah"
197440,204240," we don't need dark mode anymore just like enable the flag for for chromium so we don't need a dark mode"
204240,208960," uh i'm joking by the way i'll look into that and we'll see if we can merge that so essentially the"
208960,215680," problem that i had all right uh is that um from time to time i would experiment and switch to different"
215680,222080," um you know different examples and then if i recompile example i want to be able to refresh the page"
222800,229600," but if i refresh the page it goes back to the default example which is kind of meh right so it's very"
229600,236400," tedious to constantly switch back to to the example that you were working on right so it would be nice"
236400,244960," if the page actually kind of stored its state in the url so then when you refresh it recovers its own state"
245520,252320," uh you know the lost art of storing the state of the web application in the url right so we're going to"
252320,259440," recover that art right so we're going to rediscover it again uh so and here here is the pull request so"
259440,266400," another many changes actually not that many changes so uh so i put it to do in here to actually implement"
266400,275520," that so we have uh default wasm so we have wasm paths and essentially we take the values and we take"
275520,281840," basically sort of like the first element of the first value uh which i suppose makes sense right and"
281840,290560," that becomes the default uh the default example so then when we start to relib we are looking into the search"
290560,296400," path and is that even a good idea to actually do that inside of it maybe it is maybe it is"
296400,304000," so we look into that so it's an example parameter we also add that to the history so then we can actually"
304000,311840," do back right so we can press back and uh check the the previous state and then we set the ray"
311840,320720," leap example select so this is yes so we set the selector in here and here the first thing we do"
320720,328560," we'll look if there is a search path and there is a query parameter and i suppose if it is missing we're"
328560,335440," going to be using the default one if i understand all of that correctly uh right right so essentially"
335440,341280," this is operated right so this is undefined we're going to pick the the second one right so that's how"
341280,347760," this entire thing probably works uh right so let's actually do something like that uh if i have um"
347760,354880," something like hello uh 69 it's going to be just that but if i put undefined in here"
354880,361360," uh it's going to be 69 so it's sort of like it acts like or but the question is is that that different"
361360,370720," from or uh maybe it is different from or like by the way what's the difference between just doing that and"
370720,379200," that uh is there any difference but i'm going to believe that there is a difference but i mean it's"
379200,381760," it's basically like or uh so"
381760,396720," uh it would trigger on zero consider zero invalid right so if i do that okay okay i see i say so that so"
396720,402880," that's the pro jesus christ it's it's so freaking common in javascript that you have a certain feature"
402880,409040," but it has a special case that everyone is annoyed with and they introduce another construction specifically"
409040,417680," without that case it is such a freaking common pattern in javascript design it's insane they keep"
417680,425120," repeating that thing over and over and over again ah they never learn they never learn anyway so let's"
425120,431520," actually fetch the the changes and and see what we have in here so we probably need to add the uh the"
431520,442880," remote right so let me take a look at your repo uh so i'm gonna actually go into your repo right into your repo"
442880,452320," rayleapjs this is how i like to actually fetch the pull requests uh this is my personal preferences don't"
452320,461600," add me all right so we're gonna do that and don't make a default push please i beg you my number one do"
462160,468720," so you have quite a few um quite a few branches in here so what but i suppose we are only interested"
468720,475520," in this one so here's the url uh and that's the only changes you've made in here right so you only"
475520,486000," modify this thing um so let me go ahead and refresh this entire thing and here we have example game"
486560,492160," okay that makes sense so interestingly what if you provide an example that doesn't exist"
492160,499360," so it just uses it just goes back to the default one uh which probably makes sense i don't remember"
499360,509600," seeing that in a code um right so oh i suppose i suppose it does make sense right because we are"
511040,515600," starting something right so we start in the example"
515600,526480," and if wasn't path include example so this is the search path so we extract that"
526480,533840," then we query replace example default and and if it couldn't be find"
535440,543520," uh right if it doesn't exist it's going to be the default uh but then uh we are just doing that"
543520,550080," uh so i think i do understand what is going on in here right so it basically always tries to redirect"
550080,558080," to the default one um right that makes sense so now if i just go here right so i refresh everything's"
558080,565120," fine and if i go here uh and refresh everything fine i can also go back to previous states so that makes"
565120,571520," sense all that makes sense so i think i i think i like it so we have like this particular you know"
571520,578560," section of the scripts become bigger and bigger and bigger and um i think it would be nice to maybe"
578560,587760," factor it out to a separate thing at some point so but if i do it right now it will break all of the pull"
587760,592880," requests too much so maybe i'm gonna do that a little bit later right so maybe i'm gonna do that a little"
592880,602800," bit later anyway so i suppose this is fine uh i think i'm fine with that so we have parameter and initially"
602800,608320," to be fair i wanted to store an example sort of like in an anchor right so anchor would be the name"
608320,615200," of the example but i suppose the get parameters are also fine it actually implies that we may have more"
615200,621680," state in here in the future right more state in here in the future why ampersands and stuff like that"
621680,628240," so maybe some sort of like a resolution or something um because why not right so maybe more parameters can"
628240,632720," be can be actually stolen here in the application so i suppose it does make sense"
633440,638000," i suppose it does make sense all right so let me go ahead and just like merge this into i think"
638000,648720," um so looks good to me thank you so and we're going to merge it"
648720,659760," so let me go ahead and just go to the main and fetch the latest thing"
662800,671120," merge main and url so i just realized by the way that i still haven't merged the snake game right so"
671120,679040," because we ported snake game to the to the raylib.js so if i actually go here uh so one of the examples"
679040,684240," in here is the snake game which stopped working by the way for whatever freaking reason probably because"
684240,691680," i have to yeah yeah so trace lock is not implemented uh that's bizarre yeah there we go so i suppose"
691680,698800," something was cached in there uh right so and the problem with the snake as well is that the focus"
698800,705200," focus has been really a little bit weird so and this thing is using raylib.js so i still haven't merged it"
705200,711920," into the final project but maybe this is something that we can do uh like today maybe after i merged all"
711920,717440," of the pull requests so it doesn't really break too much too many pull requests um okay so all of"
717440,722560," that was merged and we already merged this thing so everything seems to be fine let's take a look at"
722560,732480," the next pull request let's take a look at the next pull request uh niche video game operating system"
732480,740480," like i would like to do that myself so this is the reason like why i don't like that like you probably"
740480,748480," copied knob.h right so you probably copied knob.h um so let me actually see yeah that's what you did you"
748480,754800," also copied the libraries and stuff like that nah like i don't know how you made those libraries and"
754800,762000," whether you make modifications to knob.h i actually have to like look into that so i really would like"
762000,770960," to do that myself i really would like that to do that myself and building final executables like native"
770960,778160," executables is not really the primary focus of this application so that's like it is not the primary"
778160,783840," focus of this application and it should not be a thing that we spend too much time on you know"
783840,790880," it's kind of nice to have a native build to sort of compare okay so this is the native thing and this"
790880,798240," is the uh web thing but making it like a full feature that we like invest into and constantly support"
798240,802640," no this project is about web it's not about native thing like"
804240,811600," no i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm not gonna actually uh not gonna actually accept that uh so it is out of"
811600,818320," scope like this kind of stuff is out of scope so thank you thank you so much uh out of scope um right"
818320,825680," and i'm gonna just close with a comment so this is definitely out of scope uh i might actually add"
825680,833200," knob built in the future right so i can add knob built in the future but uh i'm gonna do that definitely"
833200,840480," myself and to be fair it's actually relatively easy to do it right now um right because you basically"
840480,847600," go ahead and port build.sh and it's actually super simple thing to be fair it is actually super simple"
847600,856240," thing maybe we can do that um so let me go into the mutualizer and this is going to be a knob.h and i'm"
856240,863280," going to copy paste this thing in here and we can do knob.c uh all right so let's actually include knob.h"
863280,869600," maybe i'm going to use these kind of things and define knob implementation"
869600,882880," knob implementation and something like this char argv so and of course knob go rebuild"
882880,896400," yourself technology org c org so to be fair to be fair with the with knob we can actually just have a"
896400,902400," list of the examples that we want to build right so that's one of the things we can have we can have a"
902400,917040," list of these goddamn examples so let me quickly maybe do that um this is that uh-huh so that means"
917040,925120," we should be able to do something like this uh-huh so i can just do that and then i would like to go to"
925120,930640," the next space but if i jump a one uh yeah so it doesn't really work that well we can do something"
930640,937600," like this yeah it's not gonna work god damn i probably have to do that manually sometimes multiple cursors"
937600,946080," don't really work the way i want them to work um right so but that's fine that is totally fine"
948240,957680," so here is an examples to be fair to be fair we could have actually just read the examples folder"
957680,964800," but it's not it's probably not gonna work ideally because when i ported the snake there was like an"
964800,971680," entire folder here with several files right so it's probably not gonna work that easily right it's probably"
971680,978720," not gonna work that easily but whatever so maybe we can i don't know man so like all these things"
978720,987760," are all over the place how to really work with them and i don't know const char examples uh right"
987760,991440," so here are the examples and then we can do something like that"
991440,1000640," so let me let me see so comma after game oh thank you thank you so much for telling me that if i got the comma"
1002560,1009520," all right so the next thing we need to do is actually and probably find the size of the array"
1009520,1017920," array length right so we need to do the array length so it's going to be size zero uh right array length"
1017920,1025920," examples and something like this right so and as we iterate them we're going to be just basically compiling"
1025920,1037200," them so what's interesting is the first thing we're doing here we create a folder so this is probably"
1037200,1045600," something that we have to do as well uh so in knob.h we have uh make dear if not exists right so we have"
1045600,1055280," to do make dear if not exists uh so this is going to be just build and if it fails for whatever reason"
1055280,1062480," if it fails we have to return uh non-zero exit code so we might as well actually test uh this thing right"
1062480,1071440," the way uh so this is going to be cc nob uh nope c uh uh okay so i forgot the semicolon here that's fine"
1071440,1076640," right oh you won this time all right"
1078720,1091920," god damn c all right uh lost to c lost to c all right so that this one was actually useful so this"
1091920,1093440," is shrink on cat yeah"
1093440,1103920," i was too confident about c but c me up yet again that's why i hate it by the way people think i like"
1103920,1111920," c i hate this language um so let's actually try to run it and it in fact uh created the folder well i"
1111920,1122480," mean it tried it tried to create a folder and uh it already exists so let me go ahead and maybe start uh"
1122480,1128880," you know creating the commands so this is going to be cmd uh and in here we're going to do cmd count so"
1128880,1134080," we're going to be basically resetting the list of the commands we're going to be resetting the list of"
1134080,1137680," the commands on each iteration right so we're going to be reusing this entire thing and then we're going"
1137680,1145680," to do nob cmd append uh so we're going to do that by the point uh right so i'm going to do build this h"
1145680,1152400," and uh so yeah so i'm going to just copy paste this one thing"
1154240,1162880," so we're starting with clang so this is the clang uh then maybe we're going to also include this thing"
1162880,1174560," right so we include that uh and then we need to add build right but the build depends on the example so"
1174560,1182080," it's going to be s so we have to do something like knob uh tmp s printf right knob tmp s printf"
1182080,1191280," and this is going to be examples i right so we do that uh and then uh i suppose we have to do the other"
1191280,1202640," thing uh let me let me see uh now this is going to be just the examples right just the examples okay can"
1202640,1208320," you see that by the way i'm not sure you can see that uh right so this is going to be just s"
1208320,1216160," uh and that's about it right that's about it so the rest of the things uh are going to be added"
1216160,1229280," separately so this is going to be cmd and boom boom and boom there we go so this is a command line argument"
1229280,1233600," right so and it's supposed to build all of these things natively and then we just run"
1233600,1242480," knob cmd run synchronously like this and if it fails uh we are going to just return the zero exit code"
1242480,1249760," uh okay so let's just go ahead and try to build that and it's already failed because it cannot find"
1249760,1256240," uh you know this thing which is kind of bizarre because yeah you're supposed to put all flag in here"
1256240,1260880," right so this is all flag there we go so as you can see it tried to build all of them except"
1260880,1264560," the game and this is precisely what i was talking about like it cannot find the game"
1264560,1273360," right it cannot find the game so though we can actually maybe store like a pair of the examples"
1273360,1285680," right so uh const char src path uh right and the out path uh so that's how we can work with all that"
1285680,1292720," and this is going to be just one of the examples right a bunch of examples um so and if i go into this"
1292720,1300160," thing into this multi-cursor mode i can say that this is the out path right this is the out path and this is"
1300160,1308160," src path uh right and that gives us way more control over this thing we have way more control"
1308160,1316240," so in here obviously they all start with c and then in here they also start with examples right so"
1316240,1322400," this is examples but in case of game it does not start with examples so that what allows us define"
1322400,1331360," control over all of these things see uh the verify control over all of those things uh so that way"
1331360,1342080," that way oh if we're going to be doing out path we might as well even say that this is in the build"
1342080,1348160," folder this is in the build folder that way uh it's it's actually super easy to do the following"
1348160,1357520," thing okay can you see by the way uh you can't see scheisse um just a second yeah you can see that now"
1357520,1365280," so then i can say examples i uh so out path so this is the out path and examples"
1366000,1372880," i src path there we go so that makes it way easier and it gives us way more control over this stuff"
1372880,1378800," i think that's pretty cool actually uh right so maybe we want to also format it like that but i"
1378800,1383040," just don't want to spend too much time on that so let's actually try to run it and as you can see it"
1383040,1390560," is working it is twerking uh so yeah so this is the examples that we're building and we can even reuse"
1391360,1401280," this entire we can kind of reuse this entire stuff but for wasms we're gonna have a different output"
1401280,1407040," path right so for what them so we have a different output path so i think i'm gonna actually rename out"
1407040,1415840," path to bin path right so this is specifically a path for the binary right and then for the wasm we're"
1415840,1422560," gonna have something like uh wasm path right so this is gonna be wasn't path uh so this is a completely"
1422560,1427680," different situation um i wonder if there is a quick way for me to format all of that stuff"
1427680,1435360," um so that will be actually kind of nice maybe i can use emacs magic yet again like so just put that on"
1435360,1443600," a new line then go there put that on the new line go there put that on your line right then copy paste maybe"
1443600,1452640," even boom and then this can be wasm path uh and the main difference here is that it's a wasm and ends"
1452640,1463760," with wasm boom can your vim do that i don't think so i don't think so i don't think so i don't think so"
1463760,1471760," all right so let's actually build the the wasm things uh so in the future it will be easy to actually add"
1471760,1477520," more examples in here i think um so one of the things we can do in here actually we can"
1477520,1485920," sort of add stuff like this so it looks a little bit nicer and maybe even query replace not really"
1485920,1492320," query replace but maybe align something like this look at that look at that beauty look at that beauty"
1492320,1498240," so the next time you want to add a new example in here you just go ahead and add like you know another"
1498240,1505280," entry entry in here and that works automatically it works like a config holy parking shots"
1505280,1513120," holy parking shots anyways uh so uh now we want to kind of repeat the same thing so here we want to"
1513120,1521200," clean up the cmd and here we want to run the cmd so we can even run all of these things like uh in parallel"
1521200,1528800," right yeah can you see make make ninja mason and sort of favorite build system do that they all can do that"
1528800,1531600," but they all separate programs"
1531600,1542800," but here it's sort of like a part of the project um so let's go ahead and just grab one of these things"
1543520,1549280," um so that's a huge s uh uh command line i'll tell you that"
1549280,1558080," i'll tell you that we have quite a few things in here uh knob maybe i'm gonna actually start with just"
1558080,1563680," this knob cmd append uh cmd clang um"
1565440,1572160," i'm thinking maybe i'm gonna do all of these things sort of like separately if you know what i"
1572160,1583440," mean can i just do something like this but that requires like an extra cursor at the end which means"
1583440,1590720," that what if i put space in here okay i might as well even queer replace space with new line boom"
1592240,1599280," okay so we're being super efficient right now so this is going to be something like uh this"
1599280,1607440," um well i mean not super efficient right now but i tried there we go so could have actually be even"
1607440,1620560," more efficient there we go so now it allows me to do something like this knob cmd append cmd boom boom"
1622240,1635600," uh and here we can actually go ahead and say examples i uh wasm path right so this is a wasm path"
1635600,1644880," and this is examples i uh src path and then we just run this entire thing so we can even factor out"
1644880,1653040," these two uh like loops into separate functions like build uh native and build uh wasm right so build"
1653040,1660640," native uh native we can even return boolean to sort of indicate that if if an error happens or something"
1660640,1666240," like that so they don't really accept anything but maybe in the future we can make them accept something"
1666800,1675920," uh right so this is build native and then uh build wasn't this is what i like about knob is that i can"
1675920,1682800," make the build i can write the build in a proper programming language well i mean as proper as it can"
1682800,1689280," get right so because like i mean c also has its own shortcomings uh so it is what it is and it isn't what it"
1689280,1696480," isn't uh is it not i think it is right so we can do stuff like that so it leaks a little bit of memory"
1696480,1703760," but i mean that's fine um so build native built wasn't there we go so this is what we got and if"
1703760,1710320," i try to run this entire thing let's go through the compilation errors how did that happen okay so i hope"
1710320,1714880," there was not that many of them okay so there was not that many of them there we go so we got a replacement"
1714880,1720080," for build.sh right so we got a replacement for build.sh it's a little bit bigger uh but it's"
1720080,1725840," more robust and it's super easy to extend right it is super easy to extend you just add another example"
1725840,1732240," in here and that is basically it uh so you control what's the src path what is the bin path what is the"
1732240,1737440," wasm path and so on and so forth uh so that's actually pretty cool that's actually pretty cool"
1737440,1744160," theoretically these things should also work on windows if you have clang in the path right so"
1744880,1749440," you would need to have clang even on windows right because that's the only compiler that kind of do"
1749440,1755680," wasm compilation i think is that really the only compiler that can do like wasm compilation i'm"
1755680,1760560," pretty sure it is i think we can add a sync but maybe a little bit later right so i don't really want"
1760560,1773200," to work on on that right now um so so let's actually do subscribe so i'm going to commit this entire thing"
1773200,1782320," but i'm not going to remove build.sh yet because if there are any pull requests that add more examples"
1782320,1787120," removing build.sh is going to break them so i'm going to keep build.sh for a while until we"
1787120,1791200," process all the pull requests and then i'm going to remove it right so for now i'm going to just"
1791200,1796640," commit whatever we have in here so we might as well git ignore about a bunch of things in here"
1796640,1804560," uh like knob and knob old because those things are not needed so i still have a quicklin.js in here"
1804560,1814640," right it's a linter from strager right so quick bin uh yeah so here it is it works great actually it"
1814640,1820240," it works great it catches things so as you can see my javascript is perfect so i have no errors in here"
1820240,1828160," so it doesn't even complain about them okay so let's actually commit all of that maybe"
1828160,1834080," so build.sh i'm gonna actually replace this thing with maybe something like"
1834080,1842160," uh cc maybe clang because you you 100% need to have clang uh no matter what uh so now oh"
1843840,1853840," um nob nob nob dot c and then just nob to be fair to start demos locally to start demos locally you"
1853840,1861840," don't really need to build anything right because we already um commit the wasa modules we already"
1861840,1865680," commit the wasa modules so you don't really need to build anything so this could be like a separate"
1865680,1873600," section build demos build demos uh build demos so i'm gonna actually put this stuff in here"
1873600,1881120," i'm not gonna add any more information as of right now maybe in the future we're gonna actually extend it"
1881120,1892160," um all right add knob build and i'm going to push that right into the repo since i am the owner of the repo i"
1892160,1900000," don't have to go through the pull requests and shed so i can do this kind of stuff i can afford to do this"
1900000,1908320," kind of stuff dark mode all right so i've added root variables for colors uh i've been using uh root"
1908320,1914720," variables root variables that sounds scary that sounds a little bit scary so it's going to be something super"
1914720,1922720," complicated uh okay so we have some styles and uh maybe the time has come to actually maybe factor"
1922720,1930960," them out into a separate css file um oh i see i see what's going on yeah i remember this kind of"
1930960,1937600," feature in the browsers right so browsers have this like preferred color scheme right and if the preferred"
1937600,1946080," color scheme is dark uh you can just do different things in here um so yeah modern web modern web"
1946080,1956320," okay so i wonder how i can set it up so it's probably somewhere in the settings usually chromium"
1956320,1962240," can kind of understand that preferred theme is dark but uh we'll see we'll see okay so let me actually"
1962240,1968160," fetch all of that stuff so there is no conflict in here because we are not we are not updating anything"
1968160,1976160," uh so let me fetch um so let's actually fetch all these things i mean probably didn't have to do that"
1976160,1985680," because i already have this thing in here but whatever um so let's go to to the dark so probably for that"
1985680,1994080," probably for that i'll have to switch off my my flags that's for sure uh so this is going to be the default"
1994080,2001840," and i have to relaunch uh the the browser completely okay that seems to be good that seems to be gucci"
2001840,2009760," that seems to be tamaguchi so create a dashboard what the is there uh oh okay i see i see what that is"
2012800,2017760," okay if i go to local oh my god it's so slow"
2017760,2026080," uh yeah holy that is so slow i think i need to"
2026080,2029840," yeah i closed the discord it actually started to work fast"
2029840,2036560," this is so funny like i closed the discord like and it became fast"
2040240,2046880," anyways uh so let's go ahead and just see so this is sort of like a dark mode is that a dark mode i'm"
2046880,2052560," not sure so if we go to here uh so"
2052560,2067840," we don't really have anything okay so there is no median here all right so i go to the dark"
2069200,2073680," and then nothing really changed so that means the browser does not consider"
2073680,2081920," doesn't think that i prefer a darker theme right it doesn't think so um to be fair one of the things"
2081920,2089280," we can do one of the things we can do we can like ex get rid of that sort of condition that we have in"
2089280,2096080," there uh so just to test all of that uh so let me actually revert the buffer"
2096080,2102720," um so this is a color light so here you set the variables right so you set the variables"
2102720,2108560," um and we can do something i can"
2111760,2117680," by the way do like a single line comments work in css i don't remember i think there was a quirk like"
2117680,2123200," that uh i think there was a quirk like that so they do not work so we have to use a multi-line things"
2124000,2130080," uh right right right right right web am i right web um"
2130080,2141760," i kind of vaguely remember that like very very vaguely uh okay so and that seems to be okay"
2142640,2148480," oh and you even invert the the border yeah so that's basically the inversion of the border okay"
2148480,2155040," looks good to me so i think i i can merge that i think you can merge um so good to me"
2156800,2165440," thank you for your contribution all right let's merge that right into the repo freaking right into"
2165440,2173760," the repo has been merged mate uh so what else do we have in here so what's explicitly specify undefined symbols"
2173760,2185280," so i don't know whether is this something of interest but uh with uh wasmld you can explicitly"
2185280,2191760," specify which symbols are undefined the code that uses random undefined symbol does not compile"
2191760,2199200," that's kind of the point of the setup actually that is kind of the point the the setup is we set"
2199200,2205840," everything up so if you have a random undefined symbols it will still compile but will fail at"
2205840,2212000," runtime so we know what we need to implement while we are experimenting at runtime that's kind of the"
2212000,2231120," point so it's like the whole point of everything i was doing is that it compiles no matter what but fails"
2231120,2240400," at runtime uh so then it's easy for us to iterate and implement things uh so the answer is probably no"
2240400,2251440," uh so let me actually leave some sort of comment now now sorry uh the whole point the whole point was"
2251440,2267520," um the program compiles was that the program compiles no matter what no matter what but fails at runtime so it's"
2267520,2279120," easier for us to uh it's easy for us to uh iterate and uh implement uh things that um are not implemented"
2279120,2289600," yet but needed for the but but needed for the game uh execution that is kind of weird wording but whatever"
2290080,2299120," right someone's actually close with the comment uh so yeah there we go super easy merge reject reject"
2299120,2305120," merge merge merge reject reject merge uh support for working execution context okay this one is interesting"
2305120,2307600," so initially experimented with off-screen can"
2307600,2318240," there is a freaking off-screen canvas when using the canvas element on the render i think i big oh yeah i think"
2318240,2323600," i vaguely remember off screen canvas uh usually happened to a main execution thread the computation"
2323600,2328240," related to the canvas animation and render can have significant impact on application performance"
2328240,2335040," provides a canvas that can be rendered off screen decoupling the dome and a canvas api so the canvas"
2335040,2340960," element is no longer entirely dependent on the dome rendering operation can also be run inside of a worker"
2340960,2351600," allowing you to run jesus christ the browsers are getting crazier and crazier and crazier and crazier like they keep"
2351600,2364080," piling shit on top oh browser is an os yeah it is an os but it's feels like it becomes crazier than windows right so"
2365280,2379600," it's an os it's an os level of jesus jesus jesus at this point honestly at this point"
2379600,2382880," the browsers should just"
2382880,2392720," like load wasm module right and expose to the wasm module just the canvas where you can modify individual"
2392720,2398960," pixels or maybe some open gl api right and the rest of this kind of stuff layout and everything should"
2398960,2403760," be done by the application itself however they want and that will give like a whole"
2403760,2411600," that will spawn a whole market of special frameworks for that kind of emulate whatever we had built in into"
2411600,2417840," the browser but actually as a framework that you load with your application right so and that will probably"
2417840,2423920," make the browsers more lightweight right and give more responsibility to the application uh to experiment"
2423920,2430480," with how to do things uh so on the browser should become purely distribution program that's an interesting"
2430480,2439440," idea what if this is something that i said on uh on the service worker stream didn't i it's just like"
2439440,2445840," the role of the browser becomes should become like more like less and less important and the application"
2445840,2450880," themselves basically implement the functionality of the browser right so the browser becomes just the"
2450880,2456560," program distributors or something like that i don't know but maybe it's not going to be like that"
2456560,2462080," um so anyway um so to allow computer compiler without modifying the game loop blah blah blah"
2462080,2467440," but now i realize that the execution of wasm code is treated like a normal function call"
2467920,2474160," uh not a macro or micro tasks uh my i don't know what that means is that some sort of like a javascript"
2474160,2479280," runtime terminology i don't know so the worker thread will never handle user input which is useless for"
2479280,2485440," many apps also currently it is impossible to simply generate frames in a worker with off screen"
2485440,2491040," and beat map context as they don't work with 2d context so my experiment was failed but there is a code"
2491040,2496720," to run deep in a working in my thread so the experiment is failed but"
2496720,2507920," i don't understand is that like a working solution or just like a part partially failed experiment i don't"
2507920,2515600," understand um okay we're gonna leave a comment right so um"
2515600,2530240," uh i don't get it i don't get it is this some sort of working solution or just some bits of uh"
2530880,2540640," a failed experiment experiment so i don't know raylib.js is already a failed experiment we don't really"
2540640,2547360," need a failed experiment inside of a failed experiment so uh doesn't make much sense to me um so"
2547360,2554960," uh mouse click support in a core basic screen manager okay so"
2556640,2565120," uh oh it has two two actually hearts that's pretty cool people been reviewing and stuff what the"
2565120,2571680," fuck uh and it doesn't even conflict mouse click support and core basic screen manager"
2571680,2580080," gesture state um gesture tap"
2582560,2583600," gesture mapping"
2583600,2589200," oh wait a second this is not how gestures work don't they"
2589200,2599600," that is sus my friend that is sus"
2599600,2603600," mouse wheel"
2606640,2610560," ah just okay and then we add"
2610560,2620640," nah this isn't gesture tab and mouse down are not the same thing aren't they"
2620640,2624240," i think they're not the same thing"
2624240,2634880," so that's kind of sus honestly that's kind of sus um so browser"
2636640,2639760," gesture tap right"
2639760,2647280," this is not really why i want javascript just to tap"
2647280,2650640," um touch events"
2650640,2656640," uh yeah"
2659040,2662880," so lapse within consecutive and stuff like that so"
2662880,2666080," okay"
2666080,2687120," so this is this is strange uh i i thought mouse events uh yeah i thought that we should"
2688720,2692400," uh uh should have implemented uh gestures"
2692400,2697920," via via handling the touch events"
2697920,2706640," uh right no so this guy like i don't quite understand so here are uh touch events"
2706640,2712960," so i'm gonna add a single comment and i'm gonna just move on"
2716640,2720400," i'm gonna just move on handle window should close using a syncify"
2720400,2732160," i think if i adds a syncify"
2739360,2744480," i have a bad feeling about this pull request and we have a really bad feeling about this pull request"
2744480,2747360," um"
2747360,2753520," well i mean maybe that's fine maybe it's implements something like"
2755520,2768000," so where this is just okay so you changed all of the c code that's fine uh but where's the javascript code"
2768000,2774080," uh i'm interested more in the javascript code another javascript no maybe i should actually start from the"
2774800,2792480," so you rebuild all of the beans but that's fine uh so this is just like a style changing"
2792480,2806880," okay okay uh texturize asyncify"
2811200,2826720," uh texturize asyncify textures asyncify"
2826720,2835840," is that another one that adds a syncify what the are you doing people"
2838400,2842960," don't don't fucking don't you dare mother flippers making that a meme"
2842960,2846960," don't you dare making it a meme"
2846960,2852400," zozin i made the pull request with a syncify"
2866480,2880480," wait wait what the fuck is going on"
2896480,2906320," this is this is how software becomes over bloated mess this is literally how it happens uh all"
2906320,2913360," right it's support for text format trace log and set trace log uh didn't we implement it in snake"
2923040,2924160," holy"
2924160,2934960," holy"
2934960,2948720," well i mean it's part of what is the print j j s let me actually see so it's a it's not really can i"
2949920,2950800," just view it"
2950800,2957200," just view it what is this what does it copy by the way so we need to just copy it copied the name why"
2957200,2964080," do i what is this shit why does the copy the name it's so bizarre um so load div"
2964080,2967040," i just want to view it as a row"
2967040,2970560," where is the row thing okay"
2972240,2979920," sheet j s okay so there's this thing what is sheet j s i'm actually kind of"
2979920,2984240," uh not sure just a second"
2984240,2994080," um spreadsheet simplified read edit and export spreadsheet works in the web browser in modern"
2994080,3000080," service trusted by microsoft office 2016 so that's what it is"
3000080,3004400," all right so it's just like a part of the code but"
3004400,3014400," to be fair to be fair that's actually rather interesting honestly"
3017920,3025360," so the way we did that with the snake by the way right we can actually go into the into the snake"
3025360,3027840," uh let me let me finish those changes by the way"
3027840,3030960," uh so i'm going to go to"
3030960,3034880," uh main and i'm going to fetch everything"
3036880,3037440," uh"
3037440,3042400," all right so"
3042400,3051040," yeah so let's go to the snake and in case of the snake in case of the snake"
3051040,3062400," snake internally depends on stb aspirin tab right and stb aspirin tab so the way it works"
3063040,3068880," right the platform uh supplies platform log and i think we actually implemented this trace log right"
3068880,3076320," and we have an internal buffer and we do print app so the this is the thing that i implemented before"
3076320,3082960," i even started raylib.js right so that was before raylib.js and i was actually thinking maybe"
3082960,3091440," uh i could make people link i could make people link with this kind of thing"
3092640,3097920," um right but i'm really not sure i'm really not sure if i want to depend on this thing"
3097920,3102160," so oh this is actually the link to to this stuff"
3102160,3113920," uh sprint f4js it's actually very interesting that it is like an entire project it is an entire project"
3113920,3121120," so the dependency is small and has full posix can conversion support we take advantage of the included"
3121120,3127440," tokenizer to extract the arguments of the given argument point of the js array this is now allows"
3127440,3134320," us to easily implement this pesky cv ready functions text format also edit this text format text"
3134320,3139840," example that shows all the use of these functions also extending the example a bit from the original to"
3139840,3146080," test more login functionality okay this is interesting actually uh right this is interesting actually"
3146080,3153120," that like i never heard about this dependency uh that's kind of kind of cool right this is kind of"
3153120,3159920," cool you know what i need to think about it a little bit uh i need to think about it a little bit so let's"
3159920,3165920," actually make a small break let's make a small break i'm gonna make a cup of tea right and after the small"
3165920,3171840," break after i think about it after i process all of that uh we can even maybe check out this dependency"
3171840,3182240," because this sounds interesting honestly uh this sounds interesting so all right um all right so let's"
3182240,3188480," continue so maybe i'm gonna go ahead and try to uh just fetch that pull request i think it's a pretty"
3188480,3196320," interesting idea right so so i can have the copy of that file like locally uh raylib.js"
3196320,3207840," arraylib.js so let's just put it like that and uh so let's go"
3211680,3219840," so let me let me see so add i'm gonna be adding this thing uh and let's not actually"
3219840,3228480," automatically push that so let's fetch this remote thing so you made your commit right in the main"
3228480,3236160," right not like it's not called master anymore it's main okay whatever so uh this is i suppose we"
3236160,3244000," can call that printf right so maybe aspirin tab uh and see how it goes let me take a look at the changes"
3244000,3250000," uh i would prefer to actually copy paste that thing myself right because i don't know what is this"
3250000,3259280," dependency um so in terms of modification so you just edit a new uh example which is fine right which is"
3259280,3269680," totally fine uh and that's about it right so that's about it this is weird by the way so trace log level"
3269680,3272400," arcs pointed to array"
3272400,3283840," uh what isn't like print j supposed to implement wait i don't understand like why do we have this attempt to"
3283840,3293040," implement uh when we already have a dependencies that implements that am i missing something"
3293040,3304240," uh so that's bizarre let me see so is it used anywhere oh man the github is so inconvenient actually"
3305680,3316160," uh rainlib js uh okay let me see so it's not even used anywhere so isn't that"
3316160,3319200," args to"
3319200,3325520," what's the point of having this dependent i'm"
3325520,3334960," i thought it's it's just like implementation of printf and that's it like why some of these things are not"
3334960,3341360," implemented that is like what's the point of having that dependencies if half of the things are not"
3341360,3344640," implemented that doesn't make any sense to me honestly um"
3344640,3352240," so this dependency is small we take advantage of the included tokenizer to extract the"
3352240,3361360," arguments but parsing printf arguments is not the most difficult thing in my opinion isn't it"
3362480,3368960," i don't think it is difficult to do it yourself uh easily implement this now allows you to"
3368960,3375280," implement this pesky cvd functions uh text format and trace log also edit the text format example"
3375280,3383520," that shows off if that's if the tokenizer is the only thing we use like why do we add such a huge"
3383520,3389600," dependency exactly uh so let me take a look at the tokenizer so the tokenizer what does it do"
3390080,3395360," the dependency itself is in fact very small so the function tokenizer"
3395360,3399840," uh"
3399840,3402080," all right"
3402080,3408960," so this is the sort of like a ascii stuff"
3414800,3423760," so this is the tokenizer"
3423760,3432480," to be fair i don't think i'm gonna i want to go that route yet i don't think i want to go that route"
3435360,3442240," i would rather prefer a solution that just works right so one of the things i was thinking is that"
3442240,3451120," maybe we could just pre-compile stb as printf and uh essentially send the text into it via the memory"
3451120,3458880," right and then receive the final result also by the memory and as printf is already a final working"
3458880,3466960," solution right so it's like a full implementation of printf basically uh full implementation of printf and"
3466960,3473200," this like looks a bit weird i just like i'm not sure if i want to accept this particular solution"
3474240,3494000," um yeah so um so let me see thank you for uh dpr but i want to explore a different idea um um"
3495600,3506000," that involves uh involves stb as printf dot h i'll implement it myself"
3506000,3513680," right so i i came to a conclusion that no right so i didn't think i want to accept that i'm really"
3513680,3522160," sorry uh i'm really really sorry okay so what else do we have in here uh slightly improved website layout"
3523760,3543440," uh slightly improved website layout uh okay i like the current layout"
3548240,3560880," all right um text writing animation example uh so implement text subtext uh multi-line string support"
3560880,3566240," um so the interesting thing in here is that"
3566240,3576400," some of the code is actually platform independent in raylib all right and we're still re-implementing it but"
3577440,3586400," maybe that's fine uh so what is the example does uh text writing text uh but does it implement"
3586400,3594640," anything particularly new so we do feel text and it also yeah it also actually includes"
3594640,3600960," all right okay that sounds interesting okay that sounds interesting it's just like"
3600960,3607200," yeah let's take a look at that let's take a look at this example um looks cool uh so let me"
3607200,3615200," actually close all of that stuff let's close all of that stuff uh right so let's close all of this stuff"
3615200,3617200," and let's go"
3617200,3619360," um"
3622960,3635680," um"
3635680,3635680," um"
3635680,3635680," um"
3652960,3656080," um text writing animation"
3656080,3656080," um text writing animation"
3656080,3666800," uh boom all right so i would like to actually rebuild everything just in case just in case just in case"
3666800,3675600," just in case just in case uh so that probably have rebuilt yeah so it rebuilt the bosom so i want to my"
3675600,3683120," my own build of wasm and we are ready to go to localhost let's actually go to localhost and"
3683120,3685440," text writing animation"
3686000,3697200," check it out"
3697200,3702800," press enter to restart press space to speed up okay"
3702800,3710320," oh i can hold space and it actually goes with oh i see what it could be needed for because there are games"
3710960,3714960," right so there's like a like a um"
3714960,3721520," retro games like with a dialogue and stuff like that so it's actually pretty cool okay"
3721520,3725760," that's a useful prequest thank you thank you so much uh i'm gonna actually uh maybe"
3726640,3730800," commit my own uh in a version of wasm um"
3730800,3734080," recompiled"
3734080,3737680," text wasm"
3737680,3742240," and i'm gonna push that right into your repo"
3742240,3751200," honestly maybe it also would make sense to actually add it to knob"
3752320,3758160," right so to knob build oh we don't have a knob in here so we first have to merge it all right so"
3758160,3764400," we'll do that later uh so merge the pull request uh looks good to me thank you"
3764400,3768880," boom and we're gonna merge that we're gonna merge that"
3768880,3776960," that's pretty poggers so let's go and just do it like that so i'm gonna fetch the latest changes"
3779920,3786640," merge origin main so we want to remove that so this is not needed uh we want to remove that everything"
3786640,3797280," seems to be okay uh so now uh i probably want to add like a new example that we don't have in here so"
3797280,3806480," build the sage uh right so text writing so this is input mouse wheel ah so that's the example we're gonna add"
3808400,3812240," so we're going to simply copy paste this"
3812240,3816000," text writing"
3816000,3822720," and i want to just go ahead queer replace that stuff with"
3822720,3827840," this stuff one two three and just put it like that"
3827840,3835600," just put it like that just put it like that and we're gonna do knob uh all right"
3837440,3844160," yeah so the text writing animation okay that's pretty cool um"
3844160,3859040," add this to knob build boom let's push that right into the repo okay so what's the next thing we're"
3859040,3864720," almost done we're actually almost done with all the pull requests uh so mouse click core basic screen uh"
3864720,3871760," logger raylib example okay that's cool uh load texture oh that is spicy"
3871760,3877520," loading textures and sheets i like that i like that yeah yeah"
3877520,3890160," okay so we got that so we got those things when you're loading the texture okay okay okay so you're"
3890160,3895440," taking the memory you're extracting the file path okay okay i like that you create a new image"
3895440,3907120," right so then images index off so the result is supposed to be like a structure so people are"
3907120,3912480," discussing something okay it's possible to add an event listener load that provides a true width and"
3912480,3919120," height i couldn't quite get it to work i think due to i think any tips i think does not work unless you"
3919120,3933440," okay okay uh so let me let me see so then we draw no tinting yet well i mean if there is no tinting make um"
3933440,3947120," make to do at least right make it to do uh and you rebuild all these things i see so we need to do something about wasm uh wasm binaries"
3947120,3954400," we'll see we'll see we'll see we'll see okay let me let me let me fetch those things"
3954400,3958880," uh let me fetch those things"
3958880,3967920," it's impossible without it why is it impossible wait so why why is that impossible um"
3969680,3980320," so event listener on load uh who said you can't just you know save the point of the structure you're modifying"
3980320,3992880," or something like at least okay so you have probably a pointer to some things to let's actually see um"
3994320,4001840," who said it's impossible it's kind of weird weird statement honestly um so really dot h"
4001840,4011600," so draw texture so you have some sort of an id you can kind of save that id and then"
4012800,4021200," basically store that id somewhere in javascript and once the once the image gets resolved you update"
4021200,4028880," its width and height and then when you try to like draw texture modify texture uh it might not work that"
4028880,4037680," easily yeah we'll see we'll see how we can do that um though to be fair can you just fetch the image"
4037680,4038800," synchronously at least"
4038800,4044800," or is that not possible can you can you fetch it synchronously"
4044800,4056160," that will be interesting actually uh in any case for this kind of stuff it's better to actually do to"
4056160,4061200," do uh not in the browser i think you can do at least fetch"
4062800,4069040," and fetch is synchronous asynchronous right so fetch yeah you can't easily do that yes yes"
4069040,4079920," yeah i'll need to i'll need to think about that uh so let me let me see let me see so"
4084720,4094640," texture logo ray lib texture logo ray lib uh and so let's go to ray lib js"
4094640,4103600," uh so we have this with um where is that i have to revert this stuff"
4103600,4109280," so let's put it to do um"
4114560,4122800," uh get the true width and height of the image right so when you have this kind of stuff you"
4122800,4135600," better have like to do's uh no tinting um so const do implement tinting for"
4135600,4140400," i might as well even do something like this for draw texture"
4142720,4145360," all right let's do the build"
4145360,4153520," yeah that reverted all of them back which is understandable"
4153520,4165520," and let's go ahead and run these things uh texture logo ray lib okay so"
4167440,4180880," this is a texture makes sense to me um so let's do this stuff add to do's for the rest of the required work"
4180880,4183760," right uh right"
4183760,4188080," rebuild wasm modules"
4190720,4193760," and push that and push that uh right into your repo"
4193760,4198320," uh okay"
4198320,4216800," looks good to me thank you i'm gonna merge that there is a conflict fuck all right so let's actually try to"
4216800,4224400," resolve that i'm gonna try to uh maybe merge manually myself uh so yeah let's actually merge"
4224400,4231920," uh texture logo ray leap and see where exactly it fails where exactly it creates a conflict okay so"
4231920,4237600," that that one is very easy to resolve this one is super easy to resolve you just include both of them"
4237600,4244000," right so i guess that's the that's the main problem uh yeah yeah"
4244000,4253200," so that is super easy that is super easy so let's what's the next one so it's basically yeah it's"
4253200,4260560," basically the same problem right it's basically the same problem um also it collides with the"
4261840,4267920," sort of the thing that adds the parameter to the url which which stores the parameter in url"
4267920,4274880," so let me actually see uh okay so that's the only conflict that we have in here right so that's pretty"
4274880,4284320," cool um so shape color palette text writing animation okay so that means shape color palette uh"
4285040,4291360," shape scroller palette is available so that means we have to have this thing right so we have to include"
4291360,4297200," all of the three different examples and the shape scholar is available like literally everywhere so"
4297200,4306560," all right we don't need any of that stuff anymore i suppose uh right so all of these examples are so shape"
4306560,4319120," color um yeah writing animation and stuff like that so and then we have this stuff uh so i suppose"
4319120,4323760," okay we need to include both of them all right we need to include both of them"
4324720,4332000," oof so subtext yeah i think it's just like it's pretty straightforward"
4332000,4339520," just include both of them just include both of them"
4339520,4348480," all right so and what i would like to do i would like to maybe build everything one more time just in"
4348480,4355200," case just to make sure that everything in fact compiles and i'm gonna go to here right so i'm"
4355200,4362080," gonna refresh everything so we have the uh text the text animation the text example and we have the logo"
4362080,4368480," array leap uh right shape scores so we also have that uh so many examples actually working i'm really happy"
4368480,4374880," with that actually i'm really happy with that uh so yeah so let's continue the merge let's commit the merge"
4376080,4380640," and i'm going to push that right into the repo so we're pushing all of that and that will"
4380640,4387680," automatically merge this pull request yeah there we go uh so it has been merged i kind of prefer to"
4387680,4393200," like resolve these conflicts manually with my emacs and stuff like that because i kind of got used to"
4393200,4399920," that uh right so yeah i don't like to use the github thing i think i'm too old-fashioned i think i'm"
4399920,4406000," too old-fashioned for this kind of uh all right so we're almost done support for worker"
4406000,4412160," execution so i don't really know what it's all about i don't think this pull request is gonna pass"
4412160,4420240," we're too much ahead of everyone so and we also got some uh something in here right so we get a response"
4420240,4426640," uh we get a response for the compatibility between desktop phones touch events can be handled as mouse"
4426640,4433440," events uh you can separate them by the general browser consider touch as mouse down so it's fine"
4435920,4445920," uh um um i'm not kind of sure about that honestly it's fine code you think it's a fine code"
4448640,4456560," maybe maybe maybe it is fine maybe it is fine"
4456560,4461280," he's right for the most part"
4461280,4467520," um all right okay all right"
4477840,4484000," so just a second let me review that one more time let me review that one more time current gesture"
4484000,4491200," yes yes so yes"
4491200,4493440," no i don't know"
4493440,4500640," it conflicts with all of that"
4502560,4506640," i kind of like don't want to merge it and now i have to resolve the conflict for this thing"
4506640,4515600," and you also added spaces and yeah just like well i mean you just reformatted it"
4515600,4525760," uh yeah later uh later alligator all right so it's just like it i have no motivation to resolve conflicts"
4525760,4529920," for the pull request that i kind of don't want to merge you know what i'm talking about"
4529920,4534080," like i kind of okay with having it but at the same time i kind of don't want to merge it"
4534080,4540240," and now i also have to invest effort into that and now i don't want to do that like honestly don't"
4540240,4544000," want to do that um okay so i'm sorry"
4544000,4549680," so i already have like a little motivation to press that button now you ask me to do"
4549680,4557040," like some sort of like some sort of work for that no no no no no no no no okay so um"
4557040,4564400," origin main so we're already so already everything is up to date so one of the things"
4564400,4566880," i would like to do maybe by the way is"
4566880,4575200," um merge the snake right merging the snake i think would be super beneficial it would be super beneficial"
4575200,4583280," it would probably introduce quite a few um conflicts but we can resolve them right so we can take a look"
4583280,4592960," at the snake one more time uh right so uh let me refresh everything in here and here is the snake"
4592960,4599040," here's the snake so it's it's a super cool example right so i'll give you that it's a super cool example"
4599040,4606880," so i'm pretty sure it has to be in the uh on the website so let's go ahead and merge that"
4606880,4615520," so i'm going to go to main and just literally do merge and snake and of course it failed and let's"
4615520,4623600," take a look at where exactly it failed uh okay so it failed definitely in index.html that is understandable"
4623600,4631040," also it failed in raylib.js because we added a bunch of things in here um so measure text draw"
4631040,4639520," text text i don't think these two things conflict too much right it's just like we add two separate"
4639520,4645920," things in here so that should be fine in my opinion so where is the conflict i didn't see it so here it is"
4645920,4656400," so we just added more functions in here um so that is totally fine so there is nothing in here uh all right and"
4656400,4669040," so there is that so yeah uh and apart from that only this thing fails only the okay so this one is also"
4669040,4682480," predestive forward isn't i think it is um so and i suppose i suppose all of that is not needed right so"
4682480,4693040," that's the sort of the code yeah so when the default wasm default wasm was going to be the default wasm"
4693040,4699680," default wasm is just like zero whatever is at like first uh and that's about it that's the entirety of"
4699680,4706560," the conflict actually that's the entirety of the conflict so that's pretty cool and something is"
4706560,4718320," completely broken okay so that's cool uh let's see um so fail to execute compile uh is not okay"
4719360,4725120," so this thing is not found huh so i suppose"
4725120,4736000," that is oh i know what the fuck is going on i know what the fuck is going on somebody did"
4736000,4744160," fucky wacky and oopsie doopsie i glanced over it and i was even surprised a little bit how that worked"
4744800,4750800," so you actually have to do something like this if you want it to work don't you yeah so when i was"
4750800,4756640," reviewing like i noticed that but then i looked at the behavior and it kind of worked so i thought that"
4756640,4765440," it's fine and now it actually fired up because you have freaking javascript why javascript allow that in"
4765440,4773360," the first like why the fuck this language even do that like why people design it to intentionally"
4773360,4780400," fucking screw everything up right so this is not going to work right this is not going to work"
4780400,4788720," right we can even try to do something like this right so because it takes this thing and just like spreads it like"
4788720,4798000," like that but if you have only one thing in here only one thing in here it is going to work"
4798000,4800480," that's how freaking bad javascript is"
4800480,4808320," like this is not a real language like this is not a real language even"
4808320,4814080," even like a toy scripting language it's like lua python or anything like that don't do this"
4814080,4818640," kind of like this could not be a real programming language like this is not"
4822320,4828080," it's just like it's this is like a crime against humanity like it should be forbidden by geneva"
4828080,4832880," convention i'm telling you i'm telling you um"
4832880,4842320," um sorry you're like i mean don't blame yourself i'm not blaming just you by the way right i'm not"
4842320,4847200," blaming you i'm actually blaming javascript so it's not about you it's like why javascript like"
4847200,4852400," allow that in the first place right it should just not allow this kind of in the first place"
4852400,4857600," um i mean it's javascript it's not a real language"
4857600,4863600," um all right so we've got these kind of things and this is the default behavior"
4863600,4870000," then we can take a look at the snake snake seems to be working uh and snake seems to be twerking uh so"
4870000,4874880," something wait a second who screwed up the logos"
4874880,4878880," who screwed them up"
4878880,4885840," we're gonna find the commit that screwed up the logos right so because they were fine"
4885840,4894640," but then something happened and i mean uh like the the rendering of this thing time to get blame so"
4894640,4901360," time to git bisect by the way so we're going to be doing git bisect to figure that out and it's probably"
4901360,4910160," going to be my commit right at some point anyway so let's uh commit the merge and there we go uh unmodified"
4910160,4911600," wait how"
4911600,4919920," unstaged oh so this is like an additional thing uh all right and let's do"
4921520,4928240," fix uh the default wasm right because that's what we did in here yeah fix the default wasm"
4928240,4932800," and uh let's maybe push that right into the main"
4932800,4940480," so that's pretty cool and that's pretty epic in my opinion uh so we merged a lot of"
4940480,4948400," one of the things i would like to do by the way i would probably like to get rid of the build"
4948400,4955280," so by the way the build knob build does not include snake but i think it should"
4955280,4956640," uh"
4956640,4963840," it doesn't include doesn't have snake where is the snake though um"
4963840,4966960," texture logo"
4966960,4970480," huh there's no snake"
4970480,4976960," there's also game so that means the build right now is not going to build anything particularly useful"
4977680,4983680," yeah it's not going to build all right so let's actually get rid of the build right so let's get"
4983680,4993920," rid of the build and let's only use knob uh in knob uh we had the game but now we're gonna be having"
4993920,5002480," examples sodding uh just sodding ball right uh sodding ball"
5004080,5013840," uh sodding ball something like this so let me try to rebuild this entire stuff"
5013840,5018960," sodding ball"
5018960,5029920," sodding ball is done so we also need to add uh sodding snake uh so i suppose it's sodding snake but it's actually"
5030480,5038320," behind an additional folder yeah sodding snake dot c uh and build here is going to be sodding snake"
5038320,5044640," snake and snake so that's the entirety of the things we're going to be doing in here"
5044640,5053840," uh-huh sodding uh-huh we're building all of them we're building all of them and there we go"
5055040,5059200," so that's pretty cool that's pretty cool"
5059200,5068080," so replace build sh with knob.c"
5068080,5074640," finally we have the knob built"
5076240,5085440," we have the knob build so and again somebody screwed up the um the uh the text rendering"
5085440,5096880," it worked fine but somebody screwed it up so we can even like kind of confirm that uh so we if we go"
5098400,5105360," somewhere here so this was like one hour ago um and maybe we can go to"
5105360,5109600," uh i don't know like one week"
5109600,5112720," uh so what was that"
5112720,5121840," core input okay so let's actually go here somewhere yeah and i'm going to refresh so"
5123840,5131200," yeah and if i go to basic window or maybe a screen yeah there we go so this is fine as you can see"
5131200,5139840," it is totally fine uh so we need to do git bisect so let's let's quickly do that git bisect i don't"
5139840,5148640," really remember how to use it honestly all right so git bisect git bisect so we sort of like start"
5149760,5153440," uh this command uses binary search"
5153440,5164720," so we use supply start and you say what is bad and what is good uh right so i know that this one"
5164720,5174080," is good all right this one is good and i know that this one is bad probably but i need to confirm that"
5175040,5182000," so let me let me confirm that i'm gonna literally refresh all everything in here and yeah it is bad"
5182000,5189120," so i know which is good and i know which is bad why are these the same so this doesn't make any freaking"
5189120,5196160," sense to me so i suppose i have to do something like this uh right so this is bad and the good one"
5196960,5202560," let's let me find it yeah so that was that was the good one that's for sure"
5202560,5214720," uh so how do we start so maybe i need to open all of that stuff in the terminal right i think the"
5214720,5221840," terminal is going to be beneficial for us so we're just going to go there and as you can see here we do"
5221840,5229520," git bisect start so that's the first thing we do and then we can specify bad and good as optional things"
5229520,5239440," and that's i suppose how you start um right so let's go ahead and just do that so this is bad um i'm"
5240240,5247520," copying the bad thing in here and i'm copying the good thing boom so bisecting 10 revisions uh to test"
5247520,5254320," after this one roughly left okay so i remember um yeah"
5254320,5265520," i just want to take a look uh so we currently somewhere in the middle so my git is supposed to"
5265520,5272320," show you what is good and what is bad but i'm not 100 sure uh merge request um"
5272320,5279840," okay merge pull request and it's somewhere in the middle so and it is in fact somewhere in the middle"
5279840,5283440," so let's go ahead and just like refresh"
5288240,5297200," like this and i can't see because i can't move it down for some reason yeah okay so this is bad right"
5297200,5306160," so this is definitely bad we can clearly see that it is in fact bad so git bisect bad uh all right so we"
5306160,5316400," are on a different revision this is good this is good git bisect good all right so let's refresh that uh so"
5318240,5331520," this is bad git bisect bad uh all right so what about this one um this is bad git bisect bad um"
5331520,5338960," roughly zero steps okay so i suppose this is the last one this is the last one that we need to check"
5339520,5346960," uh git bisect bad uh git bisect bad all right so that's the commit where we did the fucky waki"
5346960,5353280," we know the exact name of the person who screwed everything up and it's related to text writing animation"
5353280,5361120," obviously so that that's how you do that by the way right so if something was broken you don't know exactly where"
5361680,5367680," uh you can just use this specific command git bisect it's just like does binary search right so you can"
5367680,5374480," specify two ends uh right and it just like automatically uh like lets you say okay so this is a bad commit"
5374480,5381360," this is a good commit and it just like finds precisely where it happens all right so what exactly happened here"
5381360,5388720," so let's actually see let's actually review uh so i suppose we are uh"
5389680,5394160," ray leave by the way i'm not blaming the person who implemented that don't get me wrong so thank"
5394160,5399200," you so much for implementing that i really appreciate that uh and i do understand that i'm sometimes we"
5399200,5404640," introduce this box uh like you know accidentally maybe intentionally maybe there was a reason we are"
5404640,5413040," about to find out uh so yeah sometimes uh when i do bisect i actually find out that it's me who introduced"
5413040,5419280," those bugs right so so it's totally normal introducing bugs is totally normal right"
5420000,5426480," making mistakes is okay uh so let's take a look at the diff let's take a look at the diff so we have"
5426480,5431520," text writing a name so that's totally fine uh so what do we have in here"
5431520,5436160," aha i think i see what is going on in here right"
5438240,5440960," so we specifically in here"
5440960,5447520," that is a weird ass code"
5447520,5450880," that is a"
5462000,5463920," that is a dangerous code my friend"
5463920,5475760," so you forgot to put open curly brace in here and you forgot to put closing curly brace in here but"
5476560,5479920," for some weird reason that just works out but it"
5479920,5492160," oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy okay"
5492160,5500160," so i wonder if the straggers slinter is going to complain about any of that so it's actually kind of"
5500160,5506880," interesting uh so let me see this trigger slinter raylib js it doesn't complain that right but i mean"
5506880,5512560," there's no really syntactical error in here uh so that's fine js doesn't care by the way this would"
5512560,5519120," happen in any c-like language right so i don't think this is something specific to javascript"
5519120,5524000," per se it's just like a c-like right so in c you would have something like that"
5524960,5530560," but it's really funny how it just like looks normal at the first glance but then has the pro"
5530560,5538240," you remember something the code that looks okay at the first glance but doesn't make sense when you"
5538240,5544960," look deep into it is that a code generated by chat gpt"
5549200,5552400," but i mean chat gpt will probably like fixing this kind of stuff but i don't know"
5552400,5561760," um anyway so have you noticed that this is like a common theme with all of the generative ai"
5561760,5567920," right it's just like it looks fine only at the first glance right so it only looks fine at the first"
5567920,5574080," glance but when you start looking into that it's just like holy right and i think this is the main"
5574080,5578880," danger of ai by the way but i'm not claiming that this code is written with chat gpt by the way i'm"
5578880,5584320," just like you know joking around and making the stream entertaining uh so it's just like the common"
5584320,5590720," theme of generative ai is just like it looks okay only at the first glance right but once you start"
5590720,5598160," looking into the details it gets kind of disturbing it's sort of like in this uncanny valley territory um"
5598160,5604080," chat gpt always make two yeah that's that's a good point by the way so if this was written by"
5604080,5608720," chat gpt it would have been too obvious this is definitely not chat gpt like chat gpt like writes"
5608720,5610560," to comment each individual line"
5610560,5620800," so yeah anyway um i just wanted to talk about chat gpt"
5620800,5632320," no more or less so draw text uh yep so if you close this one it automatically becomes incorrect so you need"
5632320,5639120," need to have these two things um and interestingly if we take a look at the commit that we have in here"
5639120,5647280," right so if we take a look at the commit um this thing was removed so that's kind of the problem so you"
5647280,5655280," accidentally remove this plus font size and that plus font size was there for a reason actually it was there"
5655280,5666000," for a reason so uh let me actually go and maybe so i already have some changes in here uh don't i yeah"
5666000,5671920," so where they are here they are i see them i think i need to fix that on the latest commit um"
5672720,5680400," so maybe before doing that i think i'm gonna save this thing"
5680400,5682560," calls"
5682560,5693040," uh how can i do i think it's a git bisect reset i think that's what it is right so we just reset the state"
5693680,5702160," of the git bisect and now we can just um how do i yeah"
5702160,5710560," check out my yeah so we are in the main now and i go to raylib.js"
5712800,5721680," raylib.js i said draw text"
5721680,5724800," oh so it actually carried the changes that's cool"
5724800,5727280," for some reason"
5727280,5731760," bravo what the is going on wait wait wait"
5734560,5746800," so it was already fixed ah that's really funny so that was already fixed by somebody so blame"
5746800,5750160," uh show commits adding lines"
5750160,5757680," fix and okay yeah yeah so then it was fixed probably in a different commit"
5758480,5765600," okay so yeah i see what's going on so it was then later fixed that is totally fine uh so the only"
5765600,5775120," thing we probably need to do in here is just like add font size so add font size i think that should be"
5775120,5782000," enough i think that should be enough so now if i if i refresh everything seems to be fine in the current"
5782000,5787920," in the latest reviews uh so we may want to take a look at some other okay so this one looks all right"
5788480,5794240," this one looks all right as well everything looks all right uh but though i would like to maybe check"
5794240,5800560," the native version and just see how it corresponds to to the web one right because i don't really trust"
5800560,5802560," this thing anymore um"
5802560,5809840," i my emacs reacts very slowly to what i'm trying to do"
5811600,5822880," um um text writing animation okay text writing animation yeah it looks all right so the font is"
5822880,5834080," slightly different but overall it looks all right uh so now let me let me see let's go ahead and just uh fix"
5836000,5840960," the uh what was the function called what was the function called i think"
5840960,5846240," draw text"
5846240,5859600," fix draw text uh position why positioning positioning there we go i'm gonna push that right into the repo"
5862080,5868000," um okay so that's pretty poggers i think that is pretty freaking a poggers"
5868000,5876080," um so let's wait until everything is actually deployed"
5876080,5884720," let's wait until everything is actually deployed so uh github pages are working github pages are twerking"
5884720,5887840," so they usually pretty fast i think they're usually pretty fast"
5887840,5896480," so because i want to see that on the on the websites"
5896480,5903280," so i think they're already on the websites"
5903280,5911360," maybe not the latest version right so maybe right it doesn't have the proper position yeah but overall"
5913520,5922880," so there is a problem here with maintaining the focus i think yeah all right so that's pretty poggers"
5922880,5931840," so i incorporated and reviewed all the pull requests that i wanted to review"
5931840,5941200," i'm not sure about this one honestly not really sure about these ones so uh yeah how about that how about it"
5943520,5947360," star soldier thank you so much for uh tier one subscription thank you thank you thank you"
5947360,5955440," that's pretty cool i'm already streamed for almost two hours so i think it's a solid stream"
5955440,5963680," it's a pretty solid stream if i do say so myself so i guess that's it for today thanks everyone who's"
5963680,5969440," watch me right now i really appreciate that have a good one and i see you all on the next recreation of"
5969440,5975440," programming session with a mr azouzin i love you all"
