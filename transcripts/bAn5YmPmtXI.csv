0,19000," Okay. I'm starting recording. Say hi to YouTube."
30000,58000," It's going to be super awkward if nobody actually said it."
58000,67000," Oh, Lonzo said something. Nice. Thank you."
67000,73000," So I'm not completely dead streamer. So yeah."
73000,80000," At least one person actually responded to that. So I'm not completely dead."
80000,89000," So today according to the schedule. Hello, Ron, by the way. Hello, everyone. I'm making tea."
89000,100000," So yeah. Before I start, I want to acknowledge the donations and subs I received while being offline."
100000,109000," Actually, I received so far only one donation from Anonymous. $10, my God. Thanks for the streams, Zosie."
109000,113000," Well, you're welcome. Thank you for watching them. And thank you so much for the $10 donations."
113000,120000," A very, very generous donation. So yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it."
120000,130000," So today is what? Today is Sunday, the day of the sun. And today, according to the schedule, we're supposed to be doing a game development."
130000,143000," But today, when I woke up after breakfast, I tried to play with an idea that I wanted to implement for quite some time."
143000,152000," And I actually got hooked up to playing with that idea that I don't know, I kind of want to, I kind of want to work on it on the stream."
152000,164000," And maybe I'm going to move the game development to tomorrow. So today, I'm going to be doing something related to a thing called Emote Jam. Emote Jam."
164000,175000," Right. It's an old project. Well, not old project. It's actually a relatively recent project of mine. So let me put a link to this thing in the description."
175000,184000," Right. And of course, it's completely open source as all of my projects, all of my projects are so far open source."
184000,193000," I'm not completely fed up with open source ideas. So I'm still publishing my source code regardless of anything."
193000,222000," Right. So, yeah, I think my tea is ready. I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water and then bring it back."
222000,223000," I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water. I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water."
223000,224000," I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water. I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water."
224000,225000," I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water. I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water."
225000,228000," I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water. I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water."
228000,229000," I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water. I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water."
229000,233000," I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water. I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water."
233000,234000," I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water. I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water."
234000,235000," I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water. I'll quickly pour myself a cup of water."
235000,237000," I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water."
252000,258000," I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water. I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water."
258000,264000," I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water. I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water."
264000,269000," I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water. I'm going to quickly pour myself a cup of water."
269000,273000," You can easily download. And then you can do whatever you want with this GIF."
273000,278000," You can use it in a Discord maybe, or maybe upload it to BTTV."
278000,284000," But primary goal was to actually make them uploadable to BTTV, which is like an extension for Twitch"
284000,289000," that adds animated emotes and stuff like that. It actually adds a lot of different things."
289000,292000," Nobody gives a shit about them. Everybody uses BTTV for emotes."
292000,298000," I'm joking. I'm joking. Of course. It has a lot of useful features."
298000,306000," So, and I allocated a slot for development of Emote Jam on Monday, right?"
306000,310000," But unfortunately, I kind of want to develop this thing today."
310000,314000," So, I think I'm going to swap the slots."
314000,318000," So, today is going to be Emote Jam and tomorrow we're going to continue doing the game development."
318000,325000," So, I have a lot of ideas to extend this website and add more different functionality."
325000,333000," And for that functionality, we'll need to use some sort of a UI framework, like a frontend JavaScript UI framework."
333000,340000," And I really want to keep this entire thing lightweight and sort of like blood-free."
340000,348000," And I was thinking, what about we implement our own UI framework?"
348000,350000," Like it's a very simple one, right?"
350000,356000," So, I'm not suggesting to implement like a whole React or like whole Angular or anything like that."
356000,363000," Because these frameworks are designed to be used in so many like ranges of applications, right?"
363000,366000," They have to be very complicated and very generic."
366000,371000," We need a framework that needs to be used in only our website."
371000,374000," Can we create such a small, simple framework?"
374000,380000," And to be fair, like what UI frameworks like frontend JavaScript frameworks do, right?"
380000,381000," What do they do?"
381000,383000," They just transform DOM, right?"
383000,385000," And DOM is a tree."
385000,391000," So, that means transforming a DOM is as easy as reverting a binary tree."
391000,393000," And anyone can revert a binary tree."
393000,394000," It's a very simple problem, right?"
394000,401000," It's just like, yeah, implementing a frontend framework is as easy as inverting a binary tree."
401000,402000," So, we can do that."
402000,404000," Let's just do that."
404000,405000," So, yeah."
405000,408000," Let's just do that."
408000,411000," And actually, kind of done a similar thing before."
411000,414000," I have a schedule page that is completely useless now."
414000,417000," Well, it says that I'm live now."
417000,421000," Yeah, because I'm still following my schedule, even though on my vacation, right?"
421000,426000," I'm still following my schedule, but I'm doing offline streams instead."
426000,428000," What a pathetic person I am anyway."
428000,434000," So, this schedule actually has a lot of vulnerabilities, as you can see."
434000,441000," But on top of vulnerabilities, it also has like a small, simple framework implemented inside of it,"
441000,444000," which is based like on simple components."
444000,446000," Like for example, we have a countdown."
446000,449000," And countdown implements a UI component."
449000,454000," And yeah, you just basically construct a DOM inside of it."
454000,460000," And it's almost feels like some sort of like, I don't know, not React, because React has a preprocessor."
460000,464000," But, you know, UI framework."
464000,467000," So, can we implement something like that, but for Emote Jam?"
467000,470000," I could have just taken this thing."
470000,474000," I could have just taken this thing and moved it and reused it for Emote Jam."
474000,483000," But I think even this small framework that I developed for my schedule is still a little bit more complicated than it should have been."
483000,487000," I think I can get this kind of thing even simpler."
487000,491000," So, and that's what I want to try to do today."
491000,493000," We're going to just do the entire stream."
493000,497000," It's going to be just UI.js, UI framework experimentation."
497000,498000," Sounds great."
498000,499000," Sounds good."
499000,500000," Sounds Gucci."
500000,502000," Sounds Tamaguchi."
502000,503000," All right."
503000,505000," So, let me put salt into my tea."
505000,509000," And we're going to start."
509000,510000," We're going to start."
510000,511000," We're going to start."
511000,512000," We're going to start."
512000,513000," We're going to start."
513000,518000," All right."
518000,527000," So, support links is, of course, is a thing."
527000,529000," Oh, more people said hello."
529000,531000," You see, I'm not completely dead."
531000,532000," Yes, not a single person."
532000,533000," Actually, two people."
533000,535000," I just needed to give them a little bit more time."
535000,536000," Yes."
536000,537000," Okay."
537000,538000," I see."
538000,539000," Thank you."
539000,540000," Thank you so much for saying hello."
540000,541000," All right."
541000,543000," So, what we're going to call our framework."
543000,547000," To be fair, I don't really know what to call it."
547000,554000," So, maybe the name for this framework will sort of appear later."
554000,557000," Usually, when you don't know how to call something,"
557000,560000," that means you don't have enough information about that thing."
560000,565000," And that means we don't have enough information about our UI framework, right?"
565000,568000," So, to gather more information about our UI framework,"
568000,570000," we need to implement it first, right?"
570000,574000," Once we implement something that works to some extent,"
574000,578000," maybe then we'll have enough information to know how we want to call it."
578000,580000," Well, sounds good to me."
580000,582000," Sounds good to me."
582000,584000," Let's go."
584000,586000," Let's create something like"
586000,589000," JS, UI JS framework, right?"
589000,599000," So, this is going to be the folder in which we're going to do our experimentations, right?"
599000,603000," So, let me actually start Emacs from within this thing."
603000,605000," I'm going to start Emacs from within this thing."
605000,609000," And let's actually start with just an HTML file."
609000,612000," Emacs, why don't you open an HTML file?"
612000,613000," Thank you so much."
613000,614000," Okay."
614000,617000," So, I probably need to switch to HTML mode."
617000,622000," And let's just create a simple HTML document, right?"
622000,627000," So, it has to be something like a doc type HTML."
627000,628000," Right."
628000,630000," So, it's going to be title."
630000,633000," It's not a title, it's head, as far as I know, right?"
633000,635000," It consists of a head and a body."
635000,636000," Right."
636000,639000," So, it's going to be head and a body."
639000,642000," And here, we're going to have a maybe title."
642000,650000," So, the title is going to be JavaScript UI framework."
650000,652000," JavaScript UI framework."
652000,658000," And so, let's actually define some sort of entry point, right?"
658000,662000," At which our UI framework will build itself."
662000,663000," Right."
663000,665000," So, basically, you have a div entry."
665000,669000," So, our UI framework is supposed to like find this thing."
669000,673000," And build its UI inside of that div."
673000,674000," That's going to be the idea in here."
674000,676000," So, this is going to be an entry."
676000,680000," So, and let's actually include that UI framework."
680000,683000," So, it's going to be SRC."
683000,685000," Let's call it UIJS."
685000,686000," Right."
686000,687000," So, it's going to be UIJS."
687000,691000," Yeah, that's a very smart snippet."
691000,692000," What can I say?"
692000,694000," I have a very smart snippet."
694000,696000," So, here is the UIJS."
696000,699000," Let me open it up."
699000,700000," Okay."
700000,706000," So, I suppose we're going to go window on load."
706000,708000," Window on load."
708000,714000," And in here, we're going to try to find the entry point."
714000,718000," For some reason, there's something really wrong with my Emacs."
718000,724000," It doesn't automatically switch to the corresponding mode when I open the corresponding file."
724000,725000," Something broke."
725000,726000," Now it does that."
726000,727000," Okay."
727000,728000," Now it does that."
728000,729000," So, let's actually find the entry point."
729000,730000," And the entry point."
730000,735000," So, it's going to be document get element by ID."
735000,737000," I think this is how it's called."
737000,740000," So, and in our case, it's going to be just entry."
740000,744000," And I think just because this thing has a name entry."
744000,745000," right."
745000,746000," Has a name entry."
746000,752000," It's already available inside of the scope of the JavaScript, if I remember correctly."
752000,757000," We can try to see if it's true or not."
757000,762000," So, let me open this thing up to the two."
762000,763000," What I want you to do."
763000,764000," I want you to take a look at the elements."
764000,765000," So, here's an entry."
765000,769000," And as far as I know, if I try to do something like entry, does it automatically create it?"
769000,770000," Entry."
770000,771000," Yeah, it does."
771000,773000," So, you can automatically refer to this thing."
773000,774000," Okay."
774000,777000," So, all right."
777000,778000," Maybe we don't even have to do that."
778000,784000," So, I can do something like console entry to indicate that we have this entire thing."
784000,788000," And of course, I need to include the script in here."
788000,789000," There we go."
789000,792000," So, here is the entry."
792000,793000," Isn't that amazing?"
793000,798000," So, the entire idea that I have for my framework revolves around a simple function."
798000,802000," So, it's not going to be one of these frameworks that has a lot of classes and stuff like that."
802000,803000," Everything is going to be a function."
803000,805000," It's like a functional programming framework."
805000,806000," Yes."
806000,807000," Yes."
807000,813000," How can you claim that you're doing a functional programming if you're using classes?"
813000,814000," Hmm?"
814000,826000," Isn't a purely functional programming framework supposed to use only, you know, you know, functions?"
826000,827000," You know what I mean?"
827000,828000," Hmm?"
828000,829000," Hmm?"
829000,830000," Hmm?"
830000,831000," Hmm?"
831000,832000," Hmm?"
832000,833000," Ah!"
833000,834000," Got 'em!"
834000,835000," Got 'em!"
835000,836000," Impostors!"
836000,837000," Impostors!"
837000,838000," It's going to be actually something like 'tag'."
838000,838000," All right."
838000,838000," Which just creates a node with a specified name, right?"
838000,850000," With a specified attributes and with a specified children."
850000,855000," So, to be fair, for something like children, it would be way more convenient if it was like"
855000,856000," variadic arguments."
856000,861000," Is variadic even a term in JavaScript world?"
861000,866000," Like, everywhere, in all of the languages, these kind of functions are usually called variadic"
866000,867000," functions."
867000,870000," But JavaScript likes to invent their own terms."
870000,872000," Variadic functions."
872000,873000," REST parameters!"
873000,874000," Ah!"
874000,875000," REST parameters!"
875000,876000," They call them REST parameters!"
876000,877000," Ah!"
877000,878000," Yeah!"
878000,879000," I know why."
879000,883000," I even know why they're called REST parameters!"
883000,885000," Because it comes from LISP, right?"
885000,888000," In LISP, these kind of things are called REST parameters."
888000,893000," And sort of like, JavaScript has this relationship with the scheme, which is a dialect of LISP."
893000,896000," So, I'm not surprised that they call them REST parameters."
896000,897000," Okay."
897000,901000," So, we're going to use REST parameters for this entire thing."
901000,906000," And what this entire thing is supposed to do is just supposed to create a node, set the"
906000,909000," attributes, append the children, and return that node."
909000,915000," And so, you'll be able to actually nest these things together and have some sort of like"
915000,917000," a dome, right?"
917000,922000," Have an actual dome inside of JavaScript, so you can move that dome around, transform it"
922000,925000," however you want, and so on and so forth."
925000,928000," So, that's going to be the main idea in here."
928000,933000," So, and one of the things we probably want to do, maybe we're going to do it like that."
933000,934000," So, here's the entry."
934000,936000," And we're going to do something like tag."
936000,937000," We're going to create div."
937000,939000," We're not going to have any attributes."
939000,942000," Maybe we can add some sort of like an ID."
942000,944000," So, it's going to be a tag."
944000,947000," And what kind of children we're going to have in there?"
947000,950000," Probably, I don't know if we're going to have any children."
950000,952000," So, maybe it's going to be a single tag."
952000,957000," Maybe we can have a child as another tag, right?"
957000,964000," So, it's going to be tag div, which is going to be id child."
964000,966000," So, id child."
966000,967000," There we go."
967000,969000," So, we have two nested divs."
969000,970000," Two nested divs."
970000,974000," But it's not going to work because we have not implemented these tags."
974000,976000," We have not implemented these tags."
976000,980000," So, how do you create a new node?"
980000,983000," JavaScript create node."
983000,986000," I think it's create like a create element."
986000,988000," I think it's something like that."
988000,989000," Document create element, right?"
989000,991000," So, it's a document create element."
991000,992000," Okay."
992000,994000," Document create element."
994000,997000," And we're creating an element with that specified name."
997000,1006000," And this thing is something that we're going to return after we are done transforming it."
1006000,1011000," So, JavaScript element set attribute."
1011000,1014000," Seta set attribute."
1014000,1016000," Set attribute."
1016000,1018000," Set attribute."
1018000,1020000," So, it's as simple as that."
1020000,1023000," You just set it and there we go."
1023000,1024000," So, one of the things we probably want to do."
1024000,1029000," We want to do something like attribute of attributes."
1029000,1034000," So, attribute is supposed to be an object."
1034000,1040000," And to iterate the keys of the object, you have to use something like in, if I remember correctly."
1040000,1044000," So, let's actually imagine that if you have something like full bar."
1044000,1045000," Right?"
1045000,1046000," Full bar."
1046000,1048000," And then hello world."
1048000,1049000," Right?"
1049000,1050000," Hello world."
1050000,1053000," And then you can save that to here."
1053000,1054000," And for."
1054000,1055000," Const."
1055000,1056000," X."
1056000,1057000," Of."
1057000,1058000," Access."
1058000,1059000," Maybe."
1059000,1060000," Is it going to be in?"
1060000,1061000," Yeah, it has to be in."
1061000,1063000," And if I try to do something like console."
1063000,1064000," Console."
1064000,1065000," Log."
1065000,1066000," X."
1066000,1069000," It should do the thing."
1069000,1070000," It should do the thing."
1070000,1073000," Where is my JavaScript UI framework?"
1073000,1075000," So, I created this stuff."
1075000,1078000," Let me double check that it actually working."
1078000,1081000," So, maybe I'm going to actually make this thing a little bit bigger."
1081000,1082000," So, I can see that."
1082000,1083000," You can see that."
1083000,1084000," Everyone can see that."
1084000,1085000," All right."
1085000,1086000," So, if I do something on this."
1086000,1087000," Okay."
1087000,1090000," So, we're iterating the keys of this thing."
1090000,1091000," Which is precisely what I wanted."
1091000,1094000," So, this is going to be just a name."
1094000,1100000," And in here we're going to be doing something like arrest set attribute name."
1100000,1104000," And we're going to set it to attributes name like that."
1104000,1105000," There we go."
1105000,1106000," So, we set up the attributes."
1106000,1108000," And now we need to iterate the children."
1108000,1116000," So, for const child of children, we're going to be doing something like a result append child."
1116000,1117000," Right."
1117000,1119000," So, we're appending the child in here."
1119000,1120000," And there we go."
1120000,1121000," We have a result ready."
1121000,1130000," So, and that enables us already with just like building this dome inside of JavaScript in a very rudimentary way."
1130000,1131000," Relimentary way."
1131000,1132000," Relimentary way."
1132000,1133000," English is hard."
1133000,1134000," I'm sorry."
1134000,1135000," And this is what we've got."
1135000,1138000," We've got like a div tag."
1138000,1140000," And inside of that thing, we've got a child."
1140000,1141000," Isn't that cool?"
1141000,1143000," I think it's pretty cool actually."
1143000,1144000," Look."
1144000,1146000," And yeah, we've just been doing that."
1146000,1147000," So, that's the main idea."
1147000,1150000," That's the core of the framework."
1150000,1152000," This function."
1152000,1154000," The core of the framework."
1154000,1158000," Maybe because of that, maybe the framework has to be called like a tag."
1158000,1160000," ""Tag.js"" or something."
1160000,1161000," Is it already taken?"
1161000,1163000," I'm pretty sure it's already taken."
1163000,1164000," So, let's actually see."
1164000,1166000," So, tag."
1166000,1168000," ""Library for creating DOMA""."
1168000,1169000," Shit."
1169000,1171000," Somebody already did that."
1171000,1173000," Did they actually stole my idea?"
1173000,1174000," They probably stole my idea."
1174000,1175000," Fuck!"
1175000,1176000," It's the same idea."
1176000,1181000," It's literally shit."
1181000,1183000," It's literally the same idea."
1183000,1184000," It's the same idea."
1184000,1185000," Ah!"
1185000,1186000," So, I'm just..."
1186000,1190000," Okay, let's actually take a look at it."
1190000,1192000," So, you have void tags."
1192000,1193000," ""KComrade""."
1193000,1194000," Alright, alright."
1194000,1195000," So, isElement."
1195000,1196000," CreateElement."
1196000,1197000," Shit."
1197000,1198000," It's like, it's literally the same code."
1198000,1199000," What the fuck?"
1199000,1200000," I love it."
1200000,1201000," I love it."
1201000,1202000," I fucking love it."
1202000,1204000," I like how it is like literally the same code."
1204000,1205000," Nice."
1205000,1206000," Nice."
1206000,1207000," Ah!"
1207000,1208000," But it's..."
1208000,1209000," Is that it?"
1209000,1210000," Really?"
1210000,1211000," Is that it?"
1211000,1212000," And 18 stars."
1212000,1213000," 18 stars."
1213000,1214000," I think we can beat that."
1214000,1215000," I think we can beat that."
1215000,1216000," And I guess that's it."
1216000,1217000," It's actually..."
1217000,1218000," Yeah, it's..."
1218000,1219000," Yeah, it's..."
1219000,1220000," That's..."
1220000,1221000," That's the same code."
1221000,1222000," I think we can beat that."
1222000,1223000," I think we can beat that."
1223000,1224000," I think we can beat that."
1224000,1225000," And I guess that's it."
1225000,1226000," It's actually..."
1226000,1227000," Yeah, it's..."
1227000,1228000," That's the same code."
1228000,1229000," I think we can beat that."
1229000,1230000," I think we can beat that."
1230000,1232000," And I guess that's it."
1232000,1233000," It's actually..."
1233000,1234000," Yeah, it's..."
1234000,1236000," It doesn't do anything."
1236000,1238000," Our framework is gonna actually do a lot of shit."
1238000,1239000," On top of that."
1239000,1240000," I have a lot of ideas."
1240000,1241000," So..."
1241000,1242000," Yeah."
1242000,1243000," Okay."
1243000,1244000," Uh..."
1244000,1245000," But it's already taken."
1245000,1246000," NPM already taken."
1246000,1247000," So what about..."
1247000,1249000," Tag.gg?"
1249000,1250000," Like..."
1250000,1251000," You know..."
1251000,1252000," Fuck."
1252000,1255000," Somebody already taken that as well."
1255000,1257000," How are you supposed to enter..."
1257000,1261000," Enter a JavaScript market if it's so goddamn saturated?"
1261000,1262000," Uh..."
1262000,1263000," What about..."
1263000,1264000," Triple G?"
1264000,1265000," Uh..."
1265000,1266000," Triple G?"
1266000,1267000," Uh..."
1267000,1268000," Triple G?"
1268000,1269000," What about tag?"
1269000,1270000," I don't know."
1270000,1271000," Dollar?"
1271000,1272000," Is there..."
1272000,1273000," Is there something like that?"
1273000,1274000," Uh..."
1274000,1275000," I don't know."
1275000,1276000," You're probably..."
1276000,1277000," You're not allowed to use like a dollar in..."
1277000,1279000," In the name of the packages, but..."
1279000,1280000," Um..."
1280000,1281000," So..."
1281000,1282000," Yeah."
1282000,1283000," Uh..."
1283000,1284000," Uh..."
1284000,1286000," What about..."
1286000,1287000," T tag?"
1287000,1288000," Uh..."
1288000,1289000," Oh, sorry."
1289000,1290000," Everything..."
1290000,1291000," Everything is fucking taken."
1291000,1292000," Okay."
1292000,1293000," Uh..."
1293000,1294000," It is..."
1294000,1295000," What it is."
1295000,1296000," And it isn't..."
1296000,1297000," What it isn't."
1297000,1298000," So..."
1298000,1299000," But they also..."
1299000,1300000," Another idea..."
1300000,1301000," That I wanna actually..."
1301000,1302000," Take further."
1302000,1303000," Right?"
1303000,1304000," Another idea that I wanna take further."
1304000,1305000," Is..."
1305000,1306000," Uh..."
1306000,1307000," We're gonna have a lot of..."
1307000,1309000," Wrappers around..."
1309000,1310000," This tag function."
1310000,1311000," Right?"
1311000,1312000," So..."
1312000,1314000," We're gonna have shit ton of wrappers around..."
1314000,1315000," This..."
1315000,1315000," Uh..."
1315000,1316000," Tag function."
1316000,1317000," Um..."
1317000,1318000," Uh..."
1318000,1319000," By the way..."
1319000,1320000," What was that?"
1320000,1321000," NPM..."
1321000,1322000," Tag GG."
1322000,1323000," I..."
1323000,1325000," I didn't really look into it."
1325000,1326000," It's a markup."
1326000,1327000," Right?"
1327000,1328000," And..."
1328000,1329000," Triple G..."
1329000,1330000," Triple G didn't exist."
1330000,1332000," What about..."
1332000,1333000," TG?"
1333000,1335000," TG is probably taken."
1335000,1336000," Uh..."
1336000,1337000," It's..."
1337000,1338000," It's a type checking."
1338000,1339000," TGG."
1339000,1340000," Okay."
1340000,1341000," TGG was already taken."
1341000,1343000," But it's taken by..."
1343000,1344000," I don't know what it is."
1344000,1345000," What is TGG?"
1345000,1346000," Um..."
1346000,1347000," You know what?"
1347000,1350000," Maybe I'm gonna actually not..."
1350000,1351000," Uh..."
1351000,1353000," You know, think about the name on this stream."
1353000,1356000," Because it will make it easier for somebody..."
1356000,1359000," To steal it if I come up with something good."
1359000,1360000," So..."
1360000,1361000," Uh..."
1361000,1363000," I think I'm not gonna talk about the name of this framework."
1363000,1366000," The name of this framework is gonna be secret."
1366000,1369000," Until I actually choose the name and..."
1369000,1370000," Uh..."
1370000,1372000," Take the name on NPM."
1372000,1373000," Yes."
1373000,1375000," It's gonna be a secret."
1375000,1376000," So..."
1376000,1378000," It's gonna be a secret UI framework."
1378000,1379000," All right."
1379000,1380000," Uh..."
1380000,1381000," Uh..."
1381000,1382000," But maybe for now..."
1382000,1385000," As a temporary thing, it's gonna be just called tag."
1385000,1386000," Right."
1386000,1387000," Uh..."
1387000,1389000," So this is a code name."
1389000,1390000," Because it's like a short..."
1390000,1391000," Very short name."
1391000,1392000," Uh..."
1392000,1393000," UIGS."
1393000,1394000," And..."
1394000,1395000," Yeah."
1395000,1396000," This thing is just gonna be like that."
1396000,1398000," So here's the tag."
1398000,1399000," Uh..."
1399000,1400000," Maybe on top of that it's gonna be tag.js."
1400000,1401000," It's gonna be tag.js."
1401000,1402000," But it's not a final name."
1402000,1403000," The final name..."
1403000,1405000," I'm gonna choose it a little bit later."
1405000,1406000," All right."
1406000,1407000," So..."
1407000,1413000," One of the things that I'm gonna do in this framework is I'm gonna write a lot of wrappers around this function."
1413000,1414000," For example..."
1414000,1417000," I don't wanna create divs like that."
1417000,1418000," Divs..."
1418000,1419000," Creating divs like that is dumb."
1419000,1422000," I wanna be able to just have something like function div..."
1422000,1423000," Uh..."
1423000,1425000," Which accepts the children."
1425000,1426000," Right."
1426000,1427000," Which accepts the children."
1427000,1430000," And essentially it will just redirect to..."
1430000,1431000," Uh..."
1431000,1432000," This tag."
1432000,1433000," Right."
1433000,1434000," So the attributes."
1434000,1435000," We're not gonna set any attributes for now."
1435000,1436000," And I'm gonna unpack."
1436000,1437000," Or..."
1437000,1439000," I think this is not an unpacking."
1439000,1440000," So..."
1440000,1442000," This kind of thing is called unpacking in C++."
1442000,1445000," In JavaScript it's called like spreading."
1445000,1446000," Right."
1446000,1449000," In different languages people keep reinventing the same shit over and over again."
1449000,1451000," And just giving different names of course."
1451000,1453000," That's the classic thing people do."
1455000,1456000," Alright."
1456000,1457000," And now..."
1457000,1458000," What I wanna be able to do..."
1458000,1459000," Uh..."
1459000,1460000," Well..."
1460000,1461000," We kinda wanna have attributes."
1461000,1462000," Right."
1462000,1464000," But I wanna have a simpler way..."
1464000,1466000," Of actually setting attributes."
1466000,1467000," Because I don't wanna be able to set..."
1467000,1470000," I wanna set attributes via the..."
1470000,1472000," These objects and stuff like that."
1472000,1473000," It's kinda like meh."
1473000,1474000," Uh..."
1474000,1475000," Alright."
1475000,1478000," But one of the things we can do here is we can replace like div."
1478000,1479000," Like so."
1479000,1480000," Right."
1480000,1482000," And it's already a little bit better."
1482000,1483000," Right."
1483000,1484000," It's already a little bit better."
1484000,1485000," Um..."
1485000,1488000," So if I refresh this entire thing."
1488000,1490000," It is not working."
1490000,1491000," It is not twerking."
1491000,1492000," Because why?"
1492000,1493000," Uh..."
1493000,1495000," I don't know why to be fair."
1495000,1496000," What happened?"
1496000,1497000," File could not be accessed."
1497000,1498000," Uh..."
1498000,1499000," Oh!"
1499000,1501000," Because I renamed the framework."
1501000,1502000," It's now..."
1502000,1503000," It's called tag."
1503000,1505000," It's even called tag.js."
1505000,1506000," There we go."
1506000,1509000," Could not append child on node."
1509000,1510000," Uh..."
1510000,1511000," And that happened in some way here."
1511000,1512000," Okay."
1512000,1513000," Uh..."
1513000,1514000," Uh..."
1514000,1515000," Uh..."
1515000,1516000," To..."
1516000,1517000," To..."
1517000,1519000," I wonder where that stuff happened."
1519000,1520000," Uh..."
1520000,1522000," So where is my tag.js?"
1522000,1523000," Uh..."
1523000,1524000," So where is my tag.js?"
1524000,1525000," Uh..."
1525000,1529000," I cannot find a place where all of that is going on."
1529000,1530000," Um..."
1530000,1531000," Uh..."
1531000,1532000," Uh..."
1532000,1533000," Uh..."
1533000,1534000," I cannot append."
1534000,1535000," Uh..."
1535000,1536000," Uh..."
1536000,1537000," Uh..."
1537000,1538000," Uh..."
1538000,1539000," Uh..."
1539000,1540000," Uh..."
1540000,1541000," Trips."
1541000,1542000," There we go."
1542000,1543000," I see."
1543000,1545000," I think that's what has to be here."
1545000,1546000," And..."
1546000,1547000," Is it..."
1547000,1548000," Is it working?"
1548000,1549000," Is it working?"
1549000,1550000," No."
1550000,1551000," It is not working."
1551000,1552000," Uh..."
1552000,1554000," Parameter is not a type of node."
1554000,1555000," But what is it?"
1555000,1556000," Type of what?"
1556000,1557000," Um..."
1557000,1558000," Is it type of what?"
1558000,1559000," Is it type of what?"
1559000,1560000," Is it type of what?"
1560000,1563000," So this is supposed to be a name."
1563000,1566000," And then it's supposed to be a tag."
1566000,1567000," And..."
1567000,1569000," It should just work."
1569000,1571000," But it doesn't work."
1571000,1572000," It doesn't work."
1572000,1575000," I made a very dumb mistake."
1575000,1580000," And the language is not particularly helping."
1580000,1581000," It is not..."
1581000,1583000," So..."
1583000,1584000," But what is it then?"
1584000,1585000," Okay."
1585000,1586000," So let's actually do something like this."
1586000,1588000," So it's gonna be console.child."
1588000,1590000," I'm just gonna be a console.child."
1590000,1592000," And let me see what is it saying here."
1592000,1594000," So it says it's undefined."
1594000,1595000," Some..."
1595000,1596000," Ah!"
1596000,1597000," Because I forgot the return."
1597000,1598000," Thank you very much."
1598000,1600000," Okay."
1600000,1602000," Uh..."
1602000,1604000," Cool."
1604000,1605000," Uh..."
1605000,1606000," Yeah."
1606000,1607000," Now everything is working correctly."
1607000,1609000," So I had this interesting idea, actually."
1609000,1612000," On how to set up attributes."
1613000,1614000," Uh..."
1614000,1617000," What if you could set up attributes."
1617000,1618000," Like so."
1618000,1620000," So essentially you just have a div."
1620000,1623000," And you put this entire stuff inside of like another div."
1623000,1624000," And there we go."
1624000,1625000," You don't have to provide anything."
1625000,1628000," But if at any point you want to add like an attribute."
1628000,1630000," A special attribute to your object."
1630000,1632000," You would do something like att."
1632000,1633000," Uh..."
1633000,1634000," Right."
1634000,1635000," Something like id."
1635000,1636000," Uh..."
1636000,1637000," Child."
1637000,1638000," Right."
1638000,1641000," And that will sort of act like a builder pattern."
1641000,1642000," Right."
1642000,1643000," So you have an uh..."
1643000,1644000," A node in here."
1644000,1646000," And then you append id to it."
1646000,1648000," But the whole result is still a node."
1648000,1650000," So you don't have to modify anything."
1650000,1651000," Right."
1651000,1652000," So you create a node inside of a node."
1652000,1654000," But then you can just add an id in here."
1654000,1655000," It's actually quite convenient."
1655000,1658000," So obviously something like this is not going to work."
1658000,1660000," Unfortunately set attribute as far as I know."
1660000,1662000," It's also not going to work."
1662000,1663000," Uh..."
1663000,1664000," Because it returns undefined."
1664000,1665000," Um..."
1665000,1666000," Return."
1666000,1667000," Yeah."
1667000,1668000," It literally returns undefined."
1668000,1671000," It's not even like meant to be used in like builder pattern."
1671000,1675000," So we'll have to implement something like this ourselves."
1675000,1676000," So..."
1676000,1677000," Uh..."
1677000,1678000," Maybe one of the things we can do."
1678000,1679000," We can remove the attributes."
1679000,1682000," So you're not setting attributes like that."
1682000,1683000," Uh..."
1683000,1684000," You don't need attributes in here."
1684000,1686000," You don't need attributes in here."
1686000,1688000," And essentially maybe for the result."
1688000,1690000," We can set something like att."
1690000,1691000," Uh..."
1691000,1693000," To a function."
1693000,1694000," Right."
1694000,1695000," To a function."
1695000,1697000," That accepts name and value."
1697000,1698000," Right."
1698000,1699000," Accepts name and value."
1699000,1700000," And does something like this."
1700000,1703000," Set attribute name value."
1703000,1704000," Right."
1704000,1705000," Right."
1705000,1706000," And..."
1706000,1707000," Returns..."
1707000,1708000," Returns this."
1708000,1709000," Right."
1709000,1710000," And returns this."
1710000,1711000," There we go."
1711000,1713000," So now we have uh..."
1713000,1714000," Something like this."
1714000,1715000," And..."
1715000,1716000," There we go."
1716000,1717000," Yeah."
1717000,1718000," We managed to create that."
1718000,1719000," So the inner..."
1719000,1720000," The outer tag doesn't have any id."
1720000,1721000," But the inner one has a child."
1721000,1724000," But if you want to add the id to the inner one."
1724000,1725000," To the outer one."
1725000,1727000," You can just do att."
1727000,1728000," Uh..."
1728000,1729000," Id..."
1729000,1730000," Parent."
1730000,1731000," And..."
1731000,1732000," Yeah."
1732000,1733000," So yeah."
1733000,1734000," It seems to be working."
1734000,1735000," So..."
1735000,1737000," By default you can just create these tags."
1737000,1738000," Um..."
1738000,1739000," And..."
1739000,1740000," Um..."
1740000,1742000," If you want to add an id you can add it later."
1742000,1744000," But by default you don't have to do anything."
1744000,1745000," Sounds good."
1745000,1746000," Sounds good to me."
1746000,1747000," Actually."
1747000,1748000," Actually sounds good to me."
1748000,1752000," And on top of that whatever tag returns is an actual like node."
1752000,1753000," An actual HTML element."
1753000,1755000," So it has all of the element methods."
1755000,1757000," But we just extend it with our own ones."
1757000,1760000," So it would be kind of cool to like..."
1760000,1764000," Prevent some sort of like collisions maybe in the future and what not."
1764000,1766000," Maybe we should come up with some sort of a convention."
1766000,1769000," So mark our extended method with something."
1769000,1770000," Right?"
1770000,1771000," So..."
1771000,1772000," You know, jQuery style."
1772000,1773000," Maybe put a dollar in here."
1773000,1775000," But I mean it's already taken by jQuery."
1775000,1776000," Uh..."
1776000,1777000," I don't know."
1777000,1779000," We can put like a dollar at the end."
1779000,1780000," Right?"
1780000,1781000," So..."
1781000,1782000," To be a little bit different."
1782000,1785000," But it's still associated with jQuery."
1785000,1786000," So it's probably bad."
1786000,1787000," But I mean..."
1787000,1788000," I don't know."
1788000,1789000," Uh..."
1789000,1790000," We'll see."
1790000,1791000," We'll see."
1791000,1793000," I still haven't come up with the conventions."
1793000,1796000," Because I mean it's just like in the middle of creative process."
1796000,1800000," I just started developing this thing like half of an hour ago."
1800000,1801000," Pretty much."
1801000,1805000," But I had an idea about this thing like for quite some time."
1805000,1806000," Hmm."
1806000,1807000," All right."
1807000,1811000," So maybe we can actually finally put that thing into the DOM."
1811000,1812000," Um..."
1812000,1815000," Let's actually try to create something more interesting."
1815000,1816000," For instance, image."
1816000,1817000," Right?"
1817000,1818000," Let's create an image."
1818000,1819000," So..."
1819000,1822000," And an image you would probably accept something like SRC."
1822000,1823000," Right?"
1823000,1824000," So..."
1824000,1825000," Uh..."
1825000,1826000," Then here you would just create an image."
1826000,1827000," Uh..."
1827000,1828000," Right?"
1828000,1831000," And then you would set its attribute of SRC to SRC."
1831000,1832000," And there we go."
1832000,1833000," You have an image."
1833000,1834000," Cool."
1834000,1835000," So then..."
1835000,1836000," Um..."
1836000,1837000," Let's..."
1837000,1838000," Let's grab some image."
1838000,1840000," Do we have any interesting..."
1840000,1841000," Images."
1841000,1842000," For instance..."
1842000,1843000," Gebated."
1843000,1844000," Uh..."
1844000,1845000," Yeah."
1845000,1846000," Let's..."
1846000,1848000," Let's grab Gebated."
1848000,1849000," Let's grab Gebated."
1849000,1850000," And..."
1850000,1851000," Uh..."
1851000,1852000," Let's put it like that."
1852000,1853000," So this is a Gebated."
1853000,1854000," PNG."
1854000,1855000," Uh..."
1855000,1856000," And..."
1856000,1857000," Let's create..."
1857000,1858000," Uh..."
1858000,1859000," The following tag."
1859000,1860000," So it's going to be entry."
1860000,1861000," Append child."
1861000,1862000," Append child."
1862000,1863000," Image."
1863000,1864000," Uh..."
1864000,1865000," Gebated."
1865000,1866000," Gebated."
1866000,1867000," Uh..."
1867000,1868000," PNG."
1868000,1869000," There we go."
1869000,1870000," So we created an image."
1870000,1871000," Gebated."
1871000,1872000," So if we refresh that."
1872000,1873000," There we go."
1873000,1874000," Here's your Gebated."
1874000,1875000," So yeah."
1875000,1876000," Um..."
1876000,1877000," So here's an entry."
1877000,1878000," And here is the Gebated image."
1878000,1879000," So what I'm thinking is that..."
1879000,1880000," I have several of them."
1880000,1881000," For instance..."
1881000,1882000," Um..."
1882000,1883000," What if I have..."
1883000,1884000," A div."
1884000,1886000," And inside of a div."
1886000,1887000," I have..."
1887000,1888000," Three..."
1888000,1889000," Gebated."
1889000,1890000," Right."
1890000,1891000," So..."
1891000,1892000," And..."
1892000,1893000," Did it work?"
1893000,1894000," Did it work?"
1894000,1896000," I don't think it worked."
1896000,1897000," Which is kind of..."
1897000,1898000," Strange."
1898000,1899000," Uh..."
1899000,1902000," Why it didn't work?"
1902000,1903000," So the..."
1903000,1904000," Oh!"
1904000,1905000," There's something..."
1905000,1906000," Missing after the list."
1906000,1907000," Uh..."
1907000,1908000," Yeah."
1908000,1909000," Code."
1909000,1910000," Yeah."
1910000,1911000," So this is what it has to be."
1911000,1912000," All right."
1912000,1913000," So..."
1913000,1914000," And there we go."
1914000,1915000," We have a three Gebated."
1915000,1916000," Isn't it cool?"
1916000,1917000," We have three Gebated."
1917000,1920000," But I actually want to have Gebated on their separate lines."
1920000,1921000," So..."
1921000,1922000," Uh..."
1922000,1923000," I can just do something like this."
1923000,1924000," There we go."
1924000,1928000," So every Gebated is on its separate..."
1928000,1930000," Is on a separate line."
1930000,1935000," And furthermore, like in my framework, I want to encourage people to create a lot of these,"
1935000,1938000," small functions for each individual components."
1938000,1939000," Right?"
1939000,1944000," So in like other frameworks, the component might be some sort of a class or what not."
1944000,1947000," In my framework, a component is a function."
1947000,1949000," It's a functional framework."
1949000,1950000," Yes."
1950000,1953000," Everything is a function, including the components."
1953000,1954000," Isn't that great?"
1954000,1955000," Isn't that great?"
1955000,1958000," It's always great to have some sort of a dogma to follow."
1958000,1959000," Right?"
1959000,1960000," Uh..."
1960000,1965000," So yeah, everything is going to be a function."
1965000,1969000," For instance, maybe I'm going to create a function called Gebated."
1969000,1973000," And I can move this entire component to here."
1973000,1974000," Right?"
1974000,1976000," So let me actually align everything."
1976000,1979000," And I'm going to be returning that stuff."
1979000,1983000," And then I take an entry and I append Gebated."
1983000,1984000," Okay?"
1984000,1986000," So that creates a new component."
1986000,1988000," And here it is."
1988000,1990000," So, um..."
1990000,1993000," I mean, we can create more than just these things."
1993000,1997000," I suppose we can actually create more."
1997000,2002000," We can create elements like H1, for instance."
2002000,2005000," So it's going to be children."
2005000,2006000," Um..."
2006000,2007000," Right?"
2007000,2012000," And here it's going to be essentially return tag H1."
2012000,2015000," Uh..."
2015000,2016000," Children."
2016000,2019000," And here you're going to have something like this."
2019000,2020000," Uh..."
2020000,2026000," It's going to be H2 and maybe H3."
2026000,2029000," So another kind of things we may have."
2029000,2030000," We want to have P."
2030000,2033000," And you can, like, create some sort of, like, markdown documents."
2033000,2036000," Like, not really markdown documents, but I mean, HTML documents with..."
2036000,2038000," Like, like a blog post, for instance."
2038000,2042000," That has a title, subtitles, and some text and whatnot."
2042000,2047000," And you can easily generate all of that on the front end."
2047000,2051000," And I just realized that I forgot an extra dot in here."
2051000,2053000," So, uh..."
2053000,2054000," I just need to do something like this."
2054000,2055000," All right."
2055000,2056000," All right."
2056000,2057000," So..."
2057000,2058000," Yeah."
2058000,2060000," Let's actually create something like blog post."
2060000,2061000," All right."
2061000,2062000," Function."
2062000,2063000," Blog post."
2063000,2066000," So, and in here, I'm going to return a div."
2066000,2067000," Right?"
2067000,2068000," This is going to be like this."
2068000,2069000," Uh..."
2069000,2070000," And, uh..."
2070000,2072000," Here we're going to have H1."
2072000,2073000," Uh..."
2073000,2074000," The title."
2074000,2075000," Right?"
2075000,2076000," The title."
2076000,2078000," Then we're going to have some sort of a text in here."
2078000,2079000," Uh..."
2079000,2081000," Maybe I'm going to actually grab lorem."
2081000,2082000," Right?"
2082000,2083000," Just some lorem."
2083000,2084000," Uh..."
2084000,2085000," Ta-da-da."
2085000,2086000," Lorem..."
2086000,2087000," A possum."
2087000,2088000," Okay."
2088000,2089000," And let me just grab this thing."
2089000,2090000," And, uh..."
2090000,2091000," I can do something like lorem."
2091000,2092000," Right?"
2092000,2093000," Just put it in here."
2093000,2094000," So, this is something that we want to use in here."
2094000,2095000," Uh..."
2095000,2096000," So, this is going to be just p lorem."
2096000,2097000," Uh..."
2097000,2102040," right just put them here so this is something that we want to use in here"
2102040,2108280," uh so this is going to be just p lorem then we can have something like"
2108280,2126680," 1.1 subtitle subtitle right then another lorem and then h3 1 1 1 sub subtitle and another lorem"
2127000,2131400," there we go should be all right should be all right"
2131400,2148760," let me see okay so missing missing no 47 uh yeah i put a comma in here uh all right so let's actually"
2148760,2155640," try to replace debate it with a blog post why is it called blog post it's supposed to be called"
2155640,2164600," blog post okay let's have a blog post uh blog post and let's see uh and it failed of course"
2164600,2172680," append child one is not of type uh h1 it happened inside of h1"
2176840,2187640," yeah so this like text is a separate node okay javascript uh create text node i don't remember"
2187640,2200120," how to do that yeah create text node all right uh to do to was it wasn't it just create text um i think it"
2200120,2208280," was like create text um okay let's create a text node so maybe we're going to have a special function"
2208280,2209240," something like text"
2209240,2212600," uh"
2212600,2221320," document create text node and it's going to do that it's going to be as simple as that and now"
2221320,2225640," if you want to do these kind of things all right if you want to have a text as a child"
2226280,2230680," uh you just wrap everything in text i suppose i suppose that's what you have to do"
2230680,2234840," otherwise it's not gonna work that easily"
2234840,2238200," otherwise it's not gonna work that easily"
2238200,2246760," um all right so what do we have in here oh it works yeah there we go here's"
2248440,2253160," here's your blog post generated completely inside of the javascript like that yeah here it is"
2253160,2262840," so see it's easy why do you need to react come on uh so let me let me see can we can we do something"
2262840,2263240," like this"
2263240,2274200," so here is the blog post then we have h1 and here is the text and yeah everything is just working correctly"
2275000,2282040," more or less more or less working correctly so yeah so we have two components blog posts and debate it"
2282040,2289160," with a bunch of um with a bunch of images and stuff like that so maybe we want to create like more"
2289160,2295160," components components and it's you know that's a good name to call it a component uh do we have"
2295160,2308280," any other images in here uh so checker no uh so emote the gem wait emote gem logo"
2308280,2315640," forcing one i have a force in one image in here okay let's actually grab the force in one image"
2316520,2321800," so i'm gonna put it in here so i'm gonna put it in here so i'm gonna put it in here and uh maybe just"
2321800,2332040," maybe i'm gonna just copy paste it like that uh uh uh uh uh uh horse and horse and one but instead"
2332040,2337640," of actually aligning them on different lines we can align them on the same line so just to have some sort"
2337640,2346600," of a difference in here uh right and uh yeah there we go there they are there they are looking quite"
2346600,2356280," easily uh just switch between these kind of things and uh yeah there we go that's pretty cool so"
2356280,2362600," let's actually create meta component let's actually keep composing components as you can see we created"
2362600,2369560," small like building blocks and we build bigger building blocks out of them let's actually continue"
2369560,2377320," building like bigger and bigger blocks so you have this like three um components let's implement something"
2377320,2383880," that allows you to switch between them something like put them in each individual tab right i think"
2383880,2391640," that accepts these three components and then build the ui with three tabs uh or tabs i mean i'm not a"
2391640,2395400," designer so i don't know how to make them look like a tabs but they're going to be like links"
2395400,2401960," uh so with three tabs and by clicking on different tabs it will switch between these components like"
2401960,2406440," without reloading the page or anything like i mean in javascript completely because that's what ui"
2406440,2411640," frameworks are used for aren't they right so you can just transform the dome and as i already said"
2411640,2417320," transforming the dome is basically like inverting binary tree anyone can invert a binary tree it's a very"
2417320,2428840," simple task um so let's composing things let's keep composing things let's keep composing things let's keep"
2428840,2432440," composing things um all right"
2436040,2444920," one two two two all righty all righty all righty all righty okay so um let me see let me see so"
2444920,2453560," so they also the the tabs themselves should have some sort of like text on top of them so that means"
2453560,2464760," each sort of tab should have um should have a name right so um let's create a component called tabs and"
2464760,2473720," in here um we're gonna have them sts and essentially what i want to do in here right i want to do something"
2473720,2482200," like tabs uh and in here i'm gonna do it like this so first we're gonna have a g baited component so it's"
2482200,2490280," going to be used as the as the name uh g baited uh then we're going to have a blog post blog post uh"
2490280,2498440," blog post and then we're going to have the forcing one right there we go so just a bunch of like things to"
2498440,2508520," switch between right and here ts is actually that so i suppose we it's going to consist like tabs"
2508520,2515480," is going to consist of two components in here right so uh so this is going to be a diff um"
2515480,2522920," some sort of like um tab switcher right it's going to be a tab switcher a thing that allows you to click"
2522920,2531400," on links and the like a tab slot basically where these components will go so this tab slot is going"
2531400,2539640," to be the uh the another node into which you append uh these uh these pages in here right so that's"
2539640,2546200," basically what we're going to have in here uh so what i'm thinking maybe we're going to start with"
2546200,2551000," developing a tab switcher right uh let's start developing the tab switcher so for now i'm going to"
2551000,2558840," just return just an empty diff and let's implement tab switcher so in a tab switcher we only need the"
2558840,2567880," names right we're only going to accept the names um and also i suppose we're going to accept a function"
2567880,2576040," that will accept the index of the name right so essentially if you click on any of these names you"
2576040,2581160," will receive an index through this function right and then you can do something with that index"
2581160,2589000," um so what we're going to have in here uh so let me see we can take the names um we can take the names"
2589000,2597960," and we can map them uh like this so with the map we can get the name and the index right uh the name and"
2597960,2604040," the index and in here we're going to be returning what we're going to be returning the um the link"
2604040,2611880," right um inside of that link we're going to have uh the name and here comes the most interesting part"
2611880,2619160," so uh first of all i can probably uh set href to just nothing right to just like this kind of thing"
2619160,2627240," and i need to do on click of some sort right so i need to do on click uh and here i need to set um"
2627240,2635960," you know i need to say this kind of thing so that's what i want to actually do uh choose the index maybe"
2635960,2641720," i can actually collapse this and stuff like that unfortunately this presents the problem because a"
2641720,2646120," when it's going to be implemented it's not implemented yet let's actually quickly implement it"
2646120,2658040," uh so something like this is going to be a a a a a all right so uh when it's implemented it's going to"
2658040,2664040," have it's going to have its own on click because and click is already a function right but i want on click to act"
2664040,2671160," like a builder pattern thing that lets me attach on click callback uh that's what i want to do because"
2671160,2679320," that's what will enable me you know uh implementing this kind of feature um so let's maybe do something"
2679320,2687720," similar with att right so uh unfortunately i cannot call it on click but again as i already said"
2687720,2695080," like we need to have some sort of a convention to prevent collision with like existing node uh"
2695080,2699880," methods and one of the things i suggested maybe like use a dollar but put it at the end to not get"
2699880,2704760," associated with jquery because in jquery it's like somewhere here i i don't know like i'm not a web"
2704760,2710040," developer i didn't know web development conventions uh maybe it's a bad convention maybe you have to do"
2710040,2716280," something like this um i don't know but it looks kind of lame uh so maybe we're gonna put a dollar in"
2716280,2721960," here i don't know uh but since uh we're gonna have a convention maybe we should follow this"
2721960,2726200," convention like everywhere and maybe this kind of attributes should be also ended with this kind of"
2726200,2731480," thing or maybe to to make it look cool we can put it like between the words like on click and it looks"
2731480,2737480," fucking cool uh but in that case like what's the what's the actual rule what's the where is the position"
2737480,2745560," of dollar uh i don't know maybe maybe we're gonna stick with the end end position so if you do click"
2745560,2752520," um right essentially um i'm gonna be accepting the callback right so let's actually call the callback"
2753160,2762600," and uh let's do the following so this is gonna be this on click uh it's gonna be callback call back"
2762600,2768200," and then you can return this uh yet again so maybe i want to do the following thing because since we"
2768200,2772120," rename this thing when you need to rename this att everywhere so it can be att"
2772920,2782600," att dollar and boom boom boom boom i want you in my room okay so now we're gonna have a tab switcher"
2782600,2790440," right so okay so this gives this gives us the like a bunch of um a bunch of links right that's what it"
2790440,2797240," does it gives us a bunch of links uh now we need to put them inside of some sort of a diff right so"
2797240,2802760," this is going to be inside of a diff uh right and uh we can just return this diff"
2802760,2813640," yep and since it's a list and diff accepts actually rest uh arguments we have to actually spread it"
2813640,2819960," so we're taking the names we map them when we map the names to the uh to the links and we"
2819960,2826760," spread them uh in the diff so yeah that's basically how we achieve all that and we get a tab switcher"
2826760,2832040," we get a tab switcher so it will be kind of interesting to actually try this out uh we're"
2832040,2840600," gonna do a tab switcher and we're gonna take the the pages right we're gonna take the pages and we're"
2840600,2849480," gonna actually take their keys so it's gonna be object keys uh of ts and yeah so we give it the name and"
2849480,2856040," then another thing that we have to actually give to the tab switcher is uh the function that will"
2856040,2861400," be called on choose so let's actually put something like console log in there so it will"
2861400,2869000," basically log the index that it receives right it just logs the index it receives uh all right so"
2869000,2870280," something like this"
2870280,2879000," it will just log the index okay so let's refresh and there we go we got the like they're really"
2879000,2884760," collapsed together so but we can try to click on them and there seems to be working look at that"
2884760,2888760," there seem to be working so they return the indices and stuff like that that's actually pretty cool"
2890280,2907320," so maybe one of the things i want to do in here maybe i want to wrap uh this entire thing into some"
2907320,2910600," sort of a span right so this is going to be a span"
2910600,2923400," and that span is going to have an id of tab uh switcher"
2929480,2935000," maybe this is going to go tab so it could be just called tab not id uh but rather class because"
2935000,2941800," there's several of them right do we even have a function span uh function"
2941800,2944200," that's actually basically like that"
2944200,2952280," and i'm going to just go span uh and there we go we do have that now all right so we have a span it"
2952280,2960280," has a class uh tab and instead of this thing we have a bink and stuff like that and yeah uh this is"
2960280,2966040," a tab switcher and uh let's try to refresh this entire thing and let's take a look at the components"
2966040,2975880," in here uh so deep entry uh another diff and too many dips to be fair but here is the tab and one of the"
2975880,2980280," things i want to do with the tab is add a little bit of padding between them because they're sort of"
2980280,2990120," smashed together so i'm gonna go and create like a style um style tag um"
2990120,2998440," style it's gonna be a tab and uh padding right"
2998440,3007640," it's gonna be 10 pixels this is gonna work is it gonna work now no it didn't work because it's a class"
3007640,3011400," there we go now we're talking so we have debated block posts and forcing one"
3011400,3017800," so you can click on those things and as you can see you can actually select uh corresponding indices"
3017800,3020920," cool um so now"
3020920,3032680," maybe i'm gonna actually save the names like so just to preserve the order right because in an object the"
3032680,3039880," keys are like unordered ones so we want to have a very specific order for them right so whatever order"
3039880,3045960," happens to be here uh we're gonna use that order and the order is important because we uh like based"
3045960,3051240," everything is based on the index right so uh next thing we're gonna have we're gonna have a bunch of"
3051240,3059640," tags in here and let me actually take the names and map them with um name ts name so they're going to be"
3059640,3069960," appearing in the same order um and yeah essentially so as i already said we also need a slot all right we're"
3069960,3076760," going to have a tab a slot which is just a diff right just a diff and inside of that uh diff we're"
3076760,3084280," going to put the first slot right the the first um yeah the first tag maybe we also need to keep track"
3084280,3089000," of the current uh tab if you know what i'm talking about so this is going to be something like this we do"
3089000,3097960," need to keep track of it um so let me just put it in there and we're making a very bold assumption in"
3097960,3108120," here we're making an assumption that uh the amount of you know the amount of tags is actually greater than"
3108120,3113640," zero so let's actually put it in certain here just in case uh maybe we should handle that properly i don't"
3113640,3121720," know um but i just want to serve that just in case uh this particular code makes this kind of assumption"
3121720,3128920," right if if the length is equal to zero this will break obviously this will break okay so and then i'm"
3128920,3135000," going to just put a tab slot in here and in here we're going to have the index right so we are accepting"
3135000,3141320," the index and what do we do in this particular index well we take the tab slot right the tab slot and we"
3141320,3149080," remove the child of tags current so we're removing the current tab from there and then we appending"
3149080,3157480," the child of the new index right and then we're making the new index uh the current tab so this is"
3157480,3166280," how we implement the tab switcher this is essentially how we implement the tab switcher and it seems to be"
3166280,3174440," working so we have attributed and yeah now we have we can switch between them so yeah so this thing has"
3174440,3180440," an infinite composability this entire thing has an infinite composability it's as simple as just like"
3180440,3186760," you detach this uh like this component from the dome and you attach another one if you need to switch you"
3186760,3193000," again detach it and attach another one and so on and so forth yeah so and then you can add another one"
3193000,3200680," so if you want to add full you can just always do something like div uh text full and there you go you"
3200680,3207240," attached another tab in here with the word full as simple as that and it's like it's like over 100 lines"
3207240,3218120," of code 120 um so yeah i guess i can actually attach maybe lorem uh lorem and this one could be lorem and"
3218120,3224920," let go oh i closed it i didn't mean to close it but yeah here's your lorem here's that and so on and so"
3224920,3233560," forth you can then go to this tab switcher but you have a tab switcher and uh maybe for that particular"
3233560,3241400," tab switcher we can just do attribute class uh tap switcher right so you can put it in here and we can"
3241400,3249560," go into the index html and it's going to be tab switcher uh one two three four and it's going to be"
3249560,3255720," padding bottom and let's put this up like 20 pixels in there i don't know so there we go so now we have a"
3255720,3261640," a little bit of padding between tab switcher and everything in here and it looks okay looks okay i"
3261640,3267560," would say looks okay so maybe we have to go a little bit deeper"
3267560,3277800," so this is just a tab switcher but you know what would be cooler url router you know in a single page"
3277800,3286120," duplication so essentially uh you start with the root component which is a ur url router when it"
3286120,3293320," initializes it looks at the url and then parses it and based on the url it displays the corresponding"
3293320,3298600," page that you want to have and for example this could be one of the pages right and within that one"
3298600,3305800," of the pages you also have a like a tab switcher that also uh you know switches up its own sub dome"
3305800,3311080," or something like that so yeah you can keep composing this thing as much as you want like"
3311080,3316840," you just keep composing and composing and composing and composing so yeah sounds pretty"
3316840,3330600," cool i would like to implement that some sort of like a router um all right so maybe i need to create"
3330600,3340280," like a small small git repo um so let's initialize this entire thing in here so maybe i'm going to put"
3340280,3346680," a license uh all right so it's going to be a mit license you you can do whatever you want with this"
3346680,3352840," thing um and we want to put a readme in here i'm not sure if i want to put it but uh i just want to"
3352840,3357720," commit it because i'm afraid that i'm going to lose some of this code uh all right so it's going to be"
3357720,3367000," ready set a go and let's create a repo so i'm going to create a private repo just to not spoil um"
3367000,3375320," just to not spoil uh the topic of today's stream to people who follow me on github right so i'm going to"
3375320,3381240," actually publish it after i publish the the actual word right so i'm going to put it like tag js"
3381240,3395480," uh and uh okay let's let's put it like this um so simple front uh front and javascript uh framework"
3395480,3402520," right so it's going to be private and let's just uh i think it's supposed to like put front end in here"
3402520,3409080," right and let's just create this repo let's just create this repo it's private as you can see so"
3409080,3419080," nobody can see that it's a secret don't tell them it's our little secret repo okay i'm going to add"
3419960,3430280," origin and uh yes yes yes and let me just push that stuff right into the repo right into the repo"
3430280,3440680," all right so maybe we should explore the possibility of um introducing the router right"
3442760,3450200," so tags js uh so how are we going to have a what kind of router we're going to have uh let's just"
3450200,3459320," literally create a function uh called router right and we're going to have routes in here right so we're"
3459320,3463960," going to have routes in here and how are we going to even do that so maybe it's going to be just something"
3463960,3471480," like a router uh and here we're going to have this thing and here is the component at that specific router"
3471480,3478520," and then you can have more in here right it's kind of like router is not that different from tabs"
3478520,3483080," that's what's interesting about it it's not that different from tabs it's just like it's like tabs but"
3483080,3489960," instead of tabs which are it uses your address line that's the main difference between like tabs and router"
3490440,3498840," uh seriously uh it's pretty much the same thing uh and so that it means that it will be relatively"
3498840,3505480," easy to implement it i suppose um so we can also add something like secret uh slash secret"
3505480,3517880," so let's put something like this uh text uh this is a secret page uh this is a secret page what are you"
3517880,3525240," doing in here right and maybe on top of that we can just put some sort of a uh emote here uh something"
3525240,3535160," like uh monk omega um so let's actually grab monk omega i'm gonna copy this i think uh and w get this"
3535160,3548760," sent i think uh oh monka mega png there we go here's a mega png um and so we're gonna just put it in"
3548760,3558120," here so it's the image uh monka mega uh mega png monka mega png so all of that doesn't work because we"
3558120,3563160," don't have a router right we just don't have a rubber but maybe i can just i just want to see if this entire"
3563160,3574920," thing works at all so entry append child all right and child and uh it's gonna be something like this"
3574920,3584760," uh something didn't work time to look at the console time to look at the console okay so what we have in"
3584760,3592440," here is uh comma okay there we go it's kind of big to be fair it's kind of it's going to be so maybe we"
3592440,3598360," would could have a smaller version um maybe i can actually resize it super quick i'm going to convert"
3599000,3610760," resize 20 22 28 maybe 28. uh what did it say i didn't see what it said uh no image defined"
3610760,3620120," okay so i suppose it has to be yeah it has to be put in here"
3621880,3633960," this size 28 and i suppose also uh monka mega small png now thank you for such a beautiful error"
3633960,3639560," message it was really really helpful uh image magic i really appreciate it okay so this one"
3639560,3643880," is going to be small okay uh and it's a little bit smaller it looks like by the way"
3644840,3652360," i wonder why it looks like um let's use the original one but let's actually put it in a diff"
3652360,3661400," maybe uh we can also put the text inside of p so it's on a separate uh on a separate thingy in here"
3661400,3672920," right so it's gonna be that and uh yeah looks looks okay of course i forgot the comma yeah there we go um"
3672920,3684840," okay so that's a that's a good looking page that's a good looking page so i'm going to grab this page"
3684840,3691800," and i'm going to put it into the secret route right that's what i'm going to do that's what i'm going"
3691800,3696840," to do um okay so this is basically the root of our application"
3696840,3710840," the root of our application so we have an entry you append the router and the router will look at the"
3710840,3715720," current location based on location it will switch to uh the corresponding thing"
3715720,3726040," all right um"
3726040,3739800," so interestingly enough uh i think as far as i know like location doing something with the location"
3739800,3741880," okay let's just bring a room of like a return"
3741880,3750360," so this is going to be text i don't know that's all we have to do it's not implemented yet it's not"
3750360,3759320," so i think i want to make a small break because i need to make another cup of tea"
3759320,3766200," and i also need to pee so and after the break we're going to continue working on the router it's actually"
3766200,3773320," super interesting so i really like how simple this idea is but yet how composable it is you can just"
3773320,3779080," like keep stacking these things upon each other and yeah it's just a matter of implementing something"
3779080,3784840," more complex in this framework you know what i mean because uh something more complex will probably"
3784840,3791240," require more of these kind of uh functions and what we need to do here we need to understand what kind of"
3791240,3797160," functions we'll need but i really like how it's like a basically like a thin like very very very"
3797160,3802520," thin layer on top of vanilla js that's what i like about this thing it's just like very thin layer but"
3802520,3810120," yet it's very composable it's just like you rub it a little bit at the right um into the right interfaces"
3810120,3816360," and they just like fit together perfectly it's just like yeah kind of cool it's kind of cool it's kind"
3816360,3823240," of cool um to the two okay let's let's make a small break let's make a small break um so it's gonna be uh"
3823240,3833400," three minutes of course uh so it's gonna be three minutes uh and right"
3841960,3850840," so let's listen to some music"
3850840,3866120," all right let's make some break you guys have fun"
3871960,3883160," so"
3883160,3885160," um"
3885160,3898360," so"
3898360,3902360," um"
3915160,3928360," so"
3928360,3932360," um"
3932360,3938360," so"
3938360,3951560," so"
3951560,3955560," um"
3968360,3981560," so"
3981560,3994760," so"
3994760,4007960," so"
4007960,4021160," so"
4021160,4021160," so"
4021160,4034360," so"
4034360,4034360," so"
4034360,4051560," a little bit over time i'm sorry about that"
4051560,4051560," uh"
4051560,4064760," uh"
4064760,4066360," just a little bit"
4066360,4069880," so i'm just waiting for my kettle"
4072760,4073960," um"
4073960,4073960," um"
4073960,4073960," um"
4073960,4074440," yeah"
4074440,4078360," so as far as i know"
4078360,4081480," how do you get location javascript"
4081480,4085560," uh location um oh i think i"
4085560,4087560," yeah so document"
4087560,4090680," location actually contains a lot of"
4090680,4091800," things"
4091800,4095400," uh like yeah"
4095400,4097560," as far as i know trying to"
4099400,4101080," like look at different locations"
4101080,4104920," like location is more of a like a back-end thing"
4104920,4108920," uh as far as i know like the usual trick that people use on the web"
4108920,4114920," is when they store the route inside of like this little thing if you want to make like a"
4114920,4117880," a single page application right so"
4117880,4120440," this is one of the things you can do"
4120440,4126680," uh right so your route is inside of the hash so it's completely single page inside like"
4127800,4130200," completely front-end and"
4130200,4133480," which is actually quite good for us because"
4133480,4140680," emote jam doesn't have any back-end right it doesn't have any back-end"
4140680,4145560," so if we're gonna have like different pages in here it would be pretty convenient"
4145560,4151560," to have separate paths like that so is there any way"
4151560,4157320," any other way to manage routes in single page applications without any back-end"
4158200,4158440," i"
4158440,4162760," to be fair i don't know maybe there is so let me know if there is some way because"
4162760,4166360," this is the only way that i know right it's just that you put it in the hash"
4166360,4170760," right and maybe this is exactly what we're going to do right now right uh we're going to just look"
4170760,4178680," at the path in the hash um and uh dispatch the different pages upon upon that yeah and once we"
4178680,4182200," have that it would be actually pretty convenient in the mod jam for example"
4182760,4191000," uh to edit filters right for maybe we're going to have a separate like a filter editor uh where the"
4191000,4196360," user can input their shares uh the share parameters and stuff like that and it's going to be completely"
4196360,4202520," separate page hidden from them uh from the regular user right you probably have to click some special"
4202520,4208200," um secret button in here and it's going to be a completely separate route within a single page"
4208200,4214360," application right and it's it's necessary because again our application doesn't even have any back-end"
4214360,4222600," so everything happening on the front end um so yeah i think my team is ready so i'm gonna go and form a"
4222600,4252580," I'll see you next time."
4252600,4277760," It will be cool to actually explore if some of these things could be extracted into separate"
4277760,4281660," components of the framework."
4281660,4287000," So WebGL Preview could be just a component that you can reuse and just embed into your"
4287000,4291780," page and stuff like that."
4291780,4292780," Yeah."
4292780,4301820," And maybe we could actually extract a core functionality of a Mojem into some sort of a library that you"
4301820,4304780," can embed into your website if you want to."
4304780,4306680," That would be cool, I think."
4306680,4308680," That would be kind of cool."
4308680,4309680," I don't know."
4309680,4314680," I'm not a web developer, I'm just a dreamer."
4314680,4317580," I'm just a dreamer."
4317580,4320580," I'm just a meemer."
4320580,4327580," And I mean my life away."
4327580,4329580," Away."
4329580,4338480," So what I want you to take a look at, I want you to take a look at these things."
4338480,4342480," So do we have anything in the hash?"
4342480,4347480," So it's going to be document, and it's going to be hash."
4347480,4348480," Hash doesn't contain anything."
4348480,4349480," Okay."
4349480,4352380," So if I put something like secret in here, right?"
4352380,4361380," So this one is going to be a secret, and it couldn't do anything, unfortunately."
4361380,4363380," Is that because of this?"
4363380,4364380," Yeah, there we go."
4364380,4372880," So, and if I take a look at the document location, and if specifically hash, I think I'm interested"
4372880,4373880," in hash."
4373880,4375380," It contains the secret."
4375380,4379880," Interestingly enough, is that if the hash doesn't have anything in here, right?"
4379880,4382380," It doesn't have anything in here."
4382380,4384380," It doesn't contain the hash."
4384380,4385380," All right."
4385380,4389380," Let's go to the secret page, and maybe a secret full bar or whatnot."
4389380,4395380," I'm not sure how useful that is, but let's start with something like this."
4395380,4396380," All right."
4396380,4403380," And this is the hash, and can I split this thing by the hash?"
4403380,4404380," Okay."
4404380,4406880," And then take the first one."
4406880,4407880," Okay."
4407880,4408880," So here is the secret."
4408880,4409880," Yeah."
4409880,4412880," That's pretty much it."
4412880,4415880," Not pretty much it."
4415880,4418880," So that's how we're going to be parsing all that."
4418880,4423880," Well, in this case, maybe the root has to be actually described like this, right?"
4423880,4432380," Because if, for instance, your stuff is empty, if the route is actually empty, right?"
4432380,4435380," If you try to do that, it's going to be completely undefined."
4435380,4436380," That's very interesting."
4436380,4437380," So it doesn't crash or anything."
4437380,4440880," It's just undefined, mate."
4440880,4442880," Fucking undefined, mate."
4442880,4443880," All right."
4443880,4445880," All right."
4445880,4463880," So when we're constructing a route, when we're constructing a round, what is the easiest way to do that?"
4463880,4474880," So there should be some way to know that the location is updated, right?"
4474880,4478880," Is there some way to know that the location is updated?"
4478880,4486880," JavaScript location hash callback."
4486880,4488880," Is there any way for us to know that?"
4488880,4490880," Window when handler on hash."
4490880,4491880," There is such thing."
4491880,4493880," My God."
4493880,4496880," So window on hash change."
4496880,4498880," All right."
4498880,4507880," So maybe we're going to have some sort of like a method, I suppose."
4507880,4508880," Right."
4508880,4518880," So you just give it a div and I can do it as a result."
4518880,4521880," So this is going to be a div."
4521880,4528880," And in here, we can have some sort of a method sync."
4528880,4529880," Right."
4529880,4530880," Right."
4530880,4531880," Right."
4531880,4532880," Right."
4532880,4533880," Right."
4533880,4534880," Right."
4534880,4536880," And of course, it has to be something like this."
4536880,4537880," Right."
4537880,4538880," It's going to be method sync."
4538880,4544880," And that method is going to be called like you're supposed to call it to synchronize the hash."
4544880,4547880," Maybe we're going to even call it sync hash."
4547880,4548880," Yeah."
4548880,4549880," Boy."
4549880,4550880," Boy."
4550880,4551880," Sync hash."
4551880,4552880," Right."
4552880,4555880," And in here, we're supposed to be doing the following thing."
4555880,4556880," Right."
4556880,4558880," We're supposed to be doing the following thing."
4558880,4565880," We also need to know what's the current thing if we need to remove everything."
4565880,4566880," But maybe it doesn't matter."
4566880,4571880," Maybe one of the things we can do, we can remove all of the children from the node."
4571880,4572880," JavaScript."
4572880,4573880," JavaScript."
4573880,4574880," JavaScript."
4574880,4576880," Remove all children."
4576880,4580880," I'm going to get on some sort of FBI playlist."
4580880,4581880," FBI list."
4581880,4582880," FBI playlist."
4582880,4583880," Yes."
4583880,4584880," So, get elements by ID."
4584880,4585880," InnerHTML."
4585880,4586880," ClearText."
4586880,4587880," Content."
4587880,4588880," Looping."
4588880,4589880," To remove every last child."
4589880,4590880," Remove every last child."
4590880,4591880," Okay."
4591880,4592880," Last element ID."
4592880,4593880," ClearChildren."
4593880,4594880," MonkeyPatch."
4594880,4595880," I don't know what is a monkey patch."
4595880,4596880," I don't know what is a monkey patch."
4596880,4597880," Oh."
4597880,4598880," This is what is called monkey patch."
4598880,4599880," It's when you add methods."
4599880,4615880," Maybe this is how you're supposed to actually extend the..."
4615880,4616880," Okay."
4616880,4618880," So, there is a notion of monkey patching."
4618880,4619880," Script."
4619880,4620880," Monkey patch."
4620880,4621880," Okay."
4621880,4622880," Monkey patch in JavaScript."
4622880,4623880," Okay."
4623880,4624880," Apparently, it's a thing."
4624880,4626880," I didn't know that JavaScript people call it like that."
4626880,4628880," When working a project, we often..."
4628880,4629880," Really?"
4629880,4633880," A monkey patch in this technique to add, modify, or suppress the default behavior of a piece of"
4633880,4636880," code at runtime without changing its original source code."
4636880,4637880," Okay."
4637880,4642880," All right."
4642880,4649880," Okay."
4649880,4650880," I see what I mean."
4650880,4653880," Maybe that's precisely what we're doing in here."
4653880,4654880," We're sort of..."
4654880,4657880," But I mean, it's not like we are changing the default behavior."
4657880,4661880," It's not like we're changing the default behavior."
4661880,4664880," Sort of extending the functionality of this thing."
4664880,4668880," And maybe it has to be done through the like magical like prototypes or something."
4668880,4669880," But I'm not a JavaScript developer."
4669880,4670880," So, I don't know how to do that."
4670880,4671880," So, I don't know how to do that."
4671880,4672880," So, this works for now."
4672880,4673880," If it breaks, we can fix it later."
4673880,4674880," Doesn't matter."
4674880,4675880," Doesn't matter."
4675880,4676880," Doesn't matter."
4676880,4677880," Doesn't matter."
4677880,4678880," Doesn't matter."
4678880,4681880," It is not a showstopper."
4681880,4682880," It's not a showstopper."
4682880,4684880," It's not a showstopper."
4684880,4698880," So, the only thing I need to know is to know what's the current element so I can easily remove it."
4698880,4706880," I guess, for now, the easiest thing to do here would be to loop through every children."
4706880,4707880," Looping to remove every children."
4707880,4708880," Yeah."
4708880,4709880," Yeah."
4709880,4715880," While you have a first child, you remove the last child."
4715880,4716880," Okay."
4716880,4717880," That makes sense."
4717880,4721880," So, in here, like while this first child."
4721880,4722880," Right."
4722880,4723880," Okay."
4723880,4724880," That's cool for now, at least."
4724880,4725880," Right."
4725880,4741880," So, that way, I don't have to keep track of what's the current one, what's not current one and shit like that."
4741880,4743880," It just doesn't matter."
4743880,4744880," All right."
4744880,4749880," So, next, I need to take a look at the location document."
4749880,4750880," location hash."
4750880,4755880," And again, I'm splitting all of that stuff by hash."
4755880,4756880," Right."
4756880,4761880," Splitting all that stuff by hash and I'm taking the first one."
4761880,4762880," Right."
4762880,4766880," And so, here we can set something like location."
4766880,4767880," Okay."
4767880,4768880," Hash location."
4768880,4771880," Let's actually call it hash location."
4771880,4772880," Okay."
4772880,4773880," Okay."
4773880,4775880," Maybe I'm going to actually put it like let."
4775880,4776880," If."
4776880,4777880," Hash location."
4777880,4778880," Maybe not hash location."
4778880,4781880," We're going to set the hash location to slash."
4781880,4782880," There we go."
4782880,4783880," We have a hash location."
4783880,4784880," So, this way."
4784880,4785880," Maybe because of that, we're going to do it like this."
4785880,4786880," Oh, by the way."
4786880,4787880," Is empty string."
4787880,4788880," False."
4788880,4788880," Is empty string."
4788880,4789880," False."
4789880,4790880," Is empty string."
4790880,4791880," False."
4791880,4792880," Is empty string."
4792880,4793880," False."
4793880,4794880," So, let me close all this shit."
4794880,4795880," If."
4795880,4795880," Actually, no."
4795880,4796880," Otherwise, console.log is."
4796880,4797880," Actually, no."
4797880,4798880," Otherwise, console.log is."
4798880,4799880," Actually, no."
4799880,4801880," Otherwise, console.log is."
4801880,4802880," So, let me close all this shit."
4802880,4803880," So, let me close all this shit."
4803880,4804880," So, let me close all this shit."
4804880,4805880," If."
4805880,4806880," So, let me close all this shit."
4806880,4807880," If."
4807880,4808880," So, let me close all this shit."
4808880,4809880," If."
4809880,4809880," So, let me close all this shit."
4809880,4810880," If."
4810880,4811880," So, let me close all this shit."
4811880,4812880," If."
4812880,4814880," So, let me close all this shit."
4814880,4815880," If."
4815880,4816880," So, let me close all this shit."
4816880,4817880," If."
4817880,4818880," So, let me close all this shit."
4818880,4819880," If."
4819880,4820880," So, let me close all this shit."
4820880,4821880," If."
4821880,4822880," So, let me close all this shit."
4822880,4843840," Otherwise, console. Yes, so it answers the question whether it's false or not. That's why it has to be like that. Yes, it is false. That's perfect. So that means if it's going to be undefined or empty, it's going to be automatically redirected to a hash. Perfect. Perfect. Okay, so we remove all of this shit."
4852880,4879820," So, routes. If routes. JavaScript. Check if object has a key. Okay. If hash location in routes. We're going to just do the following thing."
4882880,4907880," We remove all the children. And then we set this to routes. Hash location. Okay, we set this location in here. Otherwise, we need to do something. I don't know. Let's put it like this."
4907880,4924880," 404. Maybe slash 404. And in here, we can do something like text. Path is not found. It's one of the things we can do. Why not? I don't see anything wrong with that."
4924880,4931980," All right. So, and essentially, if, for instance, you don't have any of this stuff, right?"
4931980,4937940," Oh, we can actually put it like this. Right. We can actually put it like this."
4937940,4951740," And if this entire thing not in here, right, the hash location, the hash location will be slash 404."
4951740,4964880," So, and we actually do assert in here from console. Log, actually assert that 404 is located in routes."
4964880,4967680," Right. If it's not located in routes, like you're doing something wrong."
4969040,4987600," So, so, so, so, so, so, so hash location, then we remove everything from this thing, and then we use that thing, and there we go."
4988400,4994320," So, so, so, yeah, this entire thing just synchronizes, synchronizes the hash location."
4994320,4998240," Just synchronizes the hash location."
4998240,5006880," So, maybe we can do it like that. We can probably take this thing and just make it an app."
5008800,5011120," Right. So, so, so here is an app."
5011120,5018720," There we go. And then we append the app to the entry, and then in here, we can do different things."
5018720,5020800," Okay."
5020800,5024160," Window on hash changed or something."
5024160,5026880," On hash change."
5034420,5040900," And here we're going to be doing one thing."
5040900,5046180," I'm going to just be doing app sync hash."
5046180,5047380," There we go."
5047380,5050180," Sync hash."
5056420,5059940," So, does it pass the new hash value there?"
5059940,5062980," Reference to a function using an event handler."
5062980,5065540," Okay. On hash change."
5065540,5066820," Location has changed."
5066820,5068740," And you actually take it directly from there."
5068740,5069060," Okay."
5069060,5072660," I guess that's pretty much it."
5072660,5074900," If I understand this stuff correctly."
5074900,5077780," Yeah."
5077780,5081620," Let me try to run this entire thing."
5081620,5083860," And something went wrong."
5084580,5086500," Nice. I'm really happy about that."
5086500,5091380," I suppose it was never actually synced."
5091380,5093700," Right. So, that's basically what happened in here."
5093700,5095540," It was never actually synced."
5095540,5096660," We can do something like this."
5096660,5098740," Okay. We're going to sync the hash."
5098740,5098980," Right."
5098980,5101620," We sync the hash once first."
5101620,5103700," Okay."
5103700,5106420," Maybe let's actually confirm that this is because of that."
5106420,5108020," So, I'm going to put something like text."
5108020,5111620," Hash is not synced."
5112900,5113620," And there we go."
5113620,5114900," Hash is not synced."
5114900,5122260," So, and then we are going to sync the hash before setting up the event listener."
5122260,5124580," And boom, we have this shit."
5124580,5128340," And within this shit, we can click on these things."
5128340,5129220," Isn't that amazing?"
5129220,5130740," I think it's goddamn amazing."
5130740,5135060," So, within this page at the bottom somewhere there."
5135060,5136500," So, this is a bunch of tabs."
5136500,5142340," I can actually put this thing into its own separate div like this."
5142340,5144740," All right."
5144740,5147380," And in here, I can add a link."
5147380,5147620," All right."
5147620,5154740," Some sort of a link saying something like secret page."
5154740,5163380," And that link is going to have a trap equal to secret, I suppose."
5163380,5165060," That's how we're going to actually do that."
5165060,5166500," Let's refresh all of that."
5166500,5169700," And as you can see, now we have a secret page down there."
5169700,5171300," And it leads to secret."
5171300,5173540," I can switch between tabs and stuff like that."
5173540,5174820," It's all working."
5174820,5176580," And then I click on secret page."
5176580,5177860," This is a secret page."
5177860,5179620," What are you doing in here?"
5179620,5181460," My God."
5181460,5182180," It actually works."
5182180,5186020," So, of course, I can go back now and keep switching between these things."
5186020,5189220," And then a secret page again on a different route."
5189220,5191380," And then I can do something like this."
5191380,5192340," Path not found."
5192340,5194500," And it works."
5194500,5200500," It's a one-handed and 60 lines framework."
5200500,5201940," All right."
5201940,5203300," First step forward."
5203300,5203940," No, I don't know why."
5203940,5205140," Yeah."
5205140,5207300," And it's pretty fast."
5207300,5211620," It's pretty fast because it just switches between like this nodes and whatnot."
5212180,5212900," The specific page."
5212900,5215540," And that's precisely the mechanism that we're going to use in Moodle Jam."
5215540,5225300," For example, switching between the main application."
5225300,5227940," The main application here is going to be visible for the users."
5227940,5234020," But then somewhere here, a shader developer will be able to click on one of these things."
5234020,5242980," And essentially switch the whole page to the shader editor, right?"
5242980,5246500," Some sort of a shader editor and edit the shaders and do their thing."
5247220,5248500," So, yeah."
5248500,5250260," I think it's going quite well so far."
5250260,5253700," So, we have a router that does things like that."
5253700,5255060," I really like that."
5255060,5256100," It's actually super fun."
5256100,5258340," Yep, yep."
5258340,5259780," And it's super easy to extend."
5259780,5262260," I can just add any page at any point."
5263140,5264660," For instance, like ""Foo""."
5264660,5269700," And this one is going to be the text ""FooPage""."
5269700,5270900," Right."
5270900,5274260," And now, if I refresh this entire thing and I just go to ""Foo""."
5274260,5274820," Here is this."
5274820,5275780," Here is the ""FooPage""."
5275780,5277860," So, it's as easy as that."
5277860,5278900," I remove the ""FooPage""."
5278900,5280340," ""Path not found anymore""."
5280340,5281700," And I can go to the main one."
5282420,5291700," To be fair, when ""Path not found"", we can also add some sort of a link back to main page."
5291700,5291940," Right."
5291940,5292900," You know what I'm talking about?"
5292900,5299940," ""patext"" back to home."
5299940,5300900," Right."
5300900,5309380," And this one is going to be just ""href addt"" back to this thing."
5309380,5312260," And something broke."
5312260,5313460," I broke something."
5313460,5315380," It's probably like a syntax error."
5315380,5316100," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
5316100,5317300," I forgot a bit of a comma."
5317300,5317860," Classic."
5317860,5319620," Goddamn classic."
5319620,5320740," All-time classic."
5320740,5322660," And if I go here."
5322660,5323540," ""Path not found""."
5323540,5324180," Back to home."
5324180,5324740," There we go."
5324740,5326900," And yeah."
5326900,5329780," This is like a straight-up website."
5329780,5330820," What the fuck?"
5330820,5335700," Yeah, this is so much fun."
5335700,5336500," I really like it."
5338500,5341460," I don't need React to have fun with web development."
5341460,5342980," I don't need any of this shit."
5342980,5346820," All right."
5346820,5350580," So, one of the questions I wanted to actually answer to myself is:"
5350580,5356100," ""Is it possible to extract the emote gem OpenGL preview"
5356100,5360900," to one of these like tag components?"""
5360900,5361140," Right."
5361140,5364900," Can I just like wrap this entire thing into a tag component?"
5365460,5367060," That would be goddamn cool."
5367060,5368900," Not gonna fucking lie, mate."
5368900,5370020," That would be cool."
5370020,5372660," So, and what kind of things this component may have?"
5372660,5379700," Well, it may actually have a special method that accepts new image data."
5379700,5380020," Right."
5380020,5382420," To reset its resetted own thing."
5382420,5388020," It may accept the name of the filter that you need to apply."
5388020,5388260," Right."
5388260,5391060," And stuff like that."
5391060,5394580," And it will just automatically work like a black box."
5394580,5394900," Right."
5394900,5398740," So, the only thing you provided is the filter and the image."
5398740,5402420," And it just previews that thing for you."
5402420,5406820," And then we're going to compose this entire page out of these small components,"
5406820,5409140," or out of these small UI components."
5409140,5414180," And again, all of that is just like a thin layer over Vanilla.js."
5414180,5416740," So, not using any frameworks or any shit like that."
5416740,5417060," Nice."
5417060,5420900," Again, I have to put a disclaimer."
5420900,5423780," I'm not saying that using frameworks is a bad thing."
5423780,5427940," And I'm not saying that you shouldn't use React, Angular, Vue, or whatever you want to use."
5427940,5431860," I'm just saying that I just want to have fun."
5431860,5432180," Okay."
5433060,5433860," Let me have fun."
5433860,5435540," Thank you."
5435540,5444100," We have half of an hour."
5444100,5446340," So, I don't know what we're going to do within half of an hour."
5446340,5450580," We can try to extract these like WebGL components."
5450580,5452340," We can try to do that."
5452340,5456180," Shouldn't be that difficult because it's just a canvas."
5456180,5456740," Right."
5456740,5458260," It's simply a canvas."
5458260,5461140," All right."
5463060,5466740," So, let's try to create the WebGL component."
5466740,5472820," Let's create a separate page called WebGL."
5472820,5476340," So, by the way, my usage of quotes is inconsistent."
5476340,5477940," I hope it's not going to piss off anyone."
5477940,5481940," So, WebGL preview."
5481940,5484980," So, this is going to be our page component."
5486660,5489620," np function, WebGL preview."
5489620,5491140," There we go."
5491140,5493380," And we're going to return here something like..."
5493380,5496820," Actually, maybe we have to just have something like a canvas."
5496820,5497140," Right."
5497140,5499220," So, let's have something like a canvas."
5499220,5505140," And in here, let's just create this thing."
5505140,5505380," All right."
5505380,5506980," So, it's going to be a canvas."
5506980,5508020," Canvas."
5509380,5510020," There we go."
5510020,5514500," Okay."
5514500,5515380," WebGL."
5515380,5517140," Not found."
5517140,5518180," Interesting."
5518180,5521060," Because if we've got a slashing here."
5521060,5523700," So, the router is not perfect, as you can see."
5523700,5524820," So, it doesn't match."
5524820,5530340," You know, it matches everything like very, very strictly."
5531220,5534420," I'm pretty sure it could be improved and relaxed a little bit."
5534420,5536260," But for now, I think it's good enough."
5536260,5540340," I think for now, the router is good enough."
5540340,5545620," So, here is the WebGL."
5545620,5551220," And maybe for the WebGL preview, I'm going to do something like dev."
5551220,5565380," So, we have simple WebGL component."
5565380,5567220," There we go."
5567220,5569940," So, simple WebGL component."
5569940,5573860," And in here, if we take a look at this kind of stuff."
5573860,5576820," Too many divs."
5576820,5577780," Here's the canvas."
5577780,5579860," Here's the canvas that we have."
5579860,5581940," Can I add some attributes in here?"
5581940,5583380," Like width."
5583380,5590740," Width being equal to, I don't know, 800."
5590740,5592660," Maybe 1-headed and 12."
5592660,5598980," And the same thing should go for the height."
5598980,5601300," Highest input."
5601300,5602100," I meant height."
5602100,5602740," Thank you so much."
5602740,5604260," All right."
5604260,5604980," So, yeah."
5604980,5605380," Here we go."
5605380,5607380," So, it's 1-headed by 1-headed 12."
5608500,5614020," So, we also need to initialize this canvas as far as you know."
5614020,5624260," So, maybe it would make sense to extract this entire thing like that."
5624260,5628500," Preview canvas."
5628500,5628740," Right."
5628740,5630340," So, this is going to be the preview canvas."
5630900,5637140," And maybe in here we're going to have something like a preview width equal to 112."
5637140,5640500," And the height being also equal to 112."
5640500,5643140," So, and that's how we're going to approach all of that."
5647460,5654020," So, preview width and preview height."
5654020,5655220," Ahoy."
5655220,5656420," Ahoy."
5656420,5658740," Ahoy."
5658740,5661300," What the fuck is wrong with me?"
5661300,5663220," I think I'm an idiot."
5663220,5666020," I'm supposed to be actually replacing these things."
5666020,5668740," Okay."
5668740,5670900," So, maybe I can do something like this."
5671940,5673700," I'm already getting tired as you can see."
5673700,5675540," That's what it's supposed to be doing."
5675540,5676020," I don't know."
5676020,5677140," I don't know what's going on with me."
5677140,5678420," All right."
5678420,5681860," So, is there html5 canvas example?"
5681860,5684020," Do we have an html5 canvas example?"
5684020,5685860," Okay."
5685860,5687540," Just give me example."
5687540,5692260," Just give me example meet."
5692260,5693780," So, we also have to create the context."
5693780,5694180," Okay."
5694180,5700740," Const preview context."
5700740,5703860," So, this one is a preview canvas."
5703860,5706260," Canvas."
5706260,5707620," And we get the 2d one."
5707620,5709780," So, let's actually initialize 2d for now."
5709780,5713060," Just to see if it's going to work properly and whatnot."
5713060,5715060," And yeah."
5715060,5717140," Then we can see what we can do."
5717140,5719860," Then we can try to initialize like a WebGL one."
5719860,5721860," Initializing WebGL is usually a pain in the ass."
5722900,5724340," Just like with OpenGL."
5724340,5727940," So, I'm not sure what exactly we're going to do in there."
5727940,5733060," So, once we have that."
5733060,5734500," What can I do in there?"
5734500,5735780," Can I feel a rectangle?"
5735780,5737380," Is there something like rect?"
5737380,5739300," Is there any way to feel rect?"
5739300,5741700," Yeah."
5741700,5742740," You do feel rect like that."
5742740,5744420," So, we have to put a style."
5744420,5747540," As far as I know."
5747540,5748820," If you want to feel this."
5748820,5750100," Like set the feel style."
5750100,5752420," You can always like set like red in here."
5752420,5753780," And that's totally fine."
5753780,5756580," So, it's like very polymorphic and whatnot."
5756580,5758660," Right."
5758660,5761140," So, preview context."
5761140,5762580," And we feel the rect."
5763540,5768420," And we may try to fill it like this."
5768420,5770100," Maybe 50 by 50."
5770100,5771300," All right."
5771300,5773300," And we'll see what's going to happen."
5773300,5775540," So, do I need to do a stroke or anything?"
5775540,5777380," It looks like I don't have to do any of this stuff."
5777380,5777700," All right."
5777700,5779940," So, let me refresh everything."
5779940,5780420," And there we go."
5780420,5781380," We have this thing."
5781380,5782420," Isn't that amazing?"
5782420,5783620," So, and yeah."
5783620,5784900," It's a separate component."
5784900,5785620," At any point."
5785620,5787380," You can actually just go here."
5787380,5789860," Secret page."
5789860,5791940," And maybe web.jl."
5791940,5792660," And there we go."
5792660,5794740," It's pretty cool."
5794740,5800420," Maybe we're going to have something like other pages in here."
5800420,5802820," Let's div."
5802820,5805300," Right."
5805300,5808740," And then this one is going to be h1."
5808740,5809940," Maybe h2."
5809940,5812900," Other pages."
5812900,5814580," So, we're going to have a secret page."
5814580,5816260," Which is also going to be something like div."
5816260,5820100," And a web.jl page."
5820100,5821300," Which is going to be web.jl."
5821300,5824340," And yeah."
5824340,5825300," That's pretty much it."
5825300,5825860," On top of that."
5825860,5828420," We can maybe have a back to home."
5828420,5831060," On both secret page."
5831060,5832420," And web.jl page."
5832420,5835140," Not quite sure."
5835140,5836340," But we can just do it like that."
5836340,5837380," I'm not sure."
5838740,5841940," It's not that difficult to actually add all of that stuff in here."
5841940,5845300," And something went horribly."
5845300,5846100," Horribly wrong."
5846100,5847860," 174."
5847860,5848820," 174."
5848820,5849540," Forgot a comma."
5849540,5851620," I'm getting used to these kind of errors."
5851620,5855060," Append shell node is not a node or something."
5855060,5855700," I suppose."
5855700,5857540," Yikes."
5857540,5860980," 35."
5860980,5861300," All right."
5861300,5863700," 167."
5863700,5864980," H2."
5866580,5867700," The reason it didn't work."
5867700,5867700," It didn't work."
5867700,5870020," The way I expected it to work."
5870020,5875380," Ah."
5875380,5876980," This is because it has to be a text."
5876980,5880900," It's actually a super common mistake."
5880900,5882900," Maybe we can do something like."
5882900,5884820," So."
5884820,5886580," Let me see."
5887700,5888820," So here's a child."
5888820,5890340," And can I type."
5890340,5891700," Of console."
5891700,5893220," Log."
5893220,5893620," Type."
5893620,5894420," Of child."
5894420,5897380," String."
5897380,5897700," Okay."
5897700,5898980," So can I do something like."
5898980,5899700," If type."
5899700,5900340," Of child."
5900340,5901700," Equal."
5901700,5901940," To."
5901940,5903620," String."
5903620,5906580," Just throw."
5906580,5908500," Like a more readable exception."
5908500,5908980," Throw."
5908980,5909540," New."
5909540,5910020," Error."
5910020,5910580," Or something."
5910580,5911860," JavaScript."
5911860,5912820," Throw."
5912820,5913140," New."
5913140,5913620," Error."
5913620,5914580," Is that what you're doing there."
5914580,5915540," In the JavaScript."
5915540,5916020," I'm pretty sure."
5916020,5916820," That's how we do that."
5916820,5917780," As you provide the description."
5917780,5918580," Inside of an error."
5918580,5920260," And stuff like that."
5920260,5922180," Yes sir."
5922180,5923140," This is how we do that."
5923140,5923620," And here."
5923620,5924820," We're going to do something like that."
5924820,5928420," Looks like."
5929780,5937300," ""You are trying to add string as the tag component."
5937300,5952020," Wrap it with the text function to turn the string into the text node."""
5952020,5952340," Right."
5952340,5954820," That's precisely what's happening there."
5954820,5955060," Right."
5955060,5959220," I think it's a little bit more like self-descripting thing."
5959220,5961460," Which actually explains the situation."
5961460,5964900," Looks like you're trying to add a string as the tag component."
5964900,5968660," Wrap it with the text function to turn the string into the text node."
5968660,5970420," And then you can go in here somewhere."
5970420,5971700," And then you can go here."
5971700,5972340," And there we go."
5972340,5975860," And it actually precisely gives you the place where this kind of shit happens."
5975860,5976260," Right."
5976260,5978180," Since this is such a common situation."
5978180,5980100," We can actually catch it."
5980100,5982980," And give the user of the framework more information."
5982980,5983860," Why not?"
5983860,5984420," Right."
5984420,5986020," Let's actually be a good framework."
5986020,5986980," Okay."
5986980,5987460," So."
5987460,5988660," Let's put it like this."
5988660,5991540," And now we know how to fix this interaction."
5991540,5991780," Okay."
5991780,5992580," That's pretty cool."
5992580,5994180," So we can go back to home."
5994180,5996340," And in home we have other pages."
5996340,5997220," We have secret page."
5997220,5998500," You can go back to home."
5998500,5999380," And webgl page."
5999380,6001860," And in webgl page we can do this kind of thing."
6001860,6005620," And this is a single page application that doesn't have any backend."
6005620,6007300," It's like literally index.html."
6007300,6008660," So yeah."
6008660,6011700," We can already like move between these things and stuff like that."
6011700,6013300," So yeah."
6013300,6019540," Though like all of these pages are automatically initialized and created."
6020340,6026100," But it's not that difficult to actually create those pages lazily as you try to access them."
6026100,6027620," So I don't think it's that big of a deal."
6027620,6028900," The main difference is going to be that."
6028900,6032580," For example, a router instead of ready components."
6032580,6032900," Right."
6032900,6037220," A router instead of ready components will accept functions that create those components."
6037220,6037700," Right."
6037700,6041620," And then if you try to access those functions for the first try."
6041620,6044500," The time it will create them and cache them."
6044500,6045220," Or maybe not."
6045220,6049380," Maybe if you switch to a different page, it's supposed to throw away that entire thing."
6049380,6050580," It depends."
6050580,6052820," It's not that difficult to implement at the end of the day."
6052820,6053540," That's my point."
6053540,6056420," So yeah."
6056420,6061860," I really like what's going on here."
6061860,6062580," I really like it."
6062580,6064260," It's a secret page."
6064260,6065140," It's a secret page."
6065140,6065940," WebGL page."
6066740,6077060," So we have that thing."
6077060,6080500," So in a more gem."
6080500,6086660," So let me take a look at what we've got."
6086660,6089140," So we have a lot of sh*t in here."
6089140,6090980," Right."
6090980,6096580," So to initialize OpenGL, to initialize WebGL."
6096580,6096820," Okay."
6096820,6098340," So we have to get the context."
6098340,6103620," But instead of taking 2D context, we have to take the WebGL context."
6103620,6104580," Let's try to do that."
6104580,6107780," Let's try to take the WebGL context."
6111460,6115860," So it's going to be WebGL context."
6115860,6118900," And something went wrong."
6118900,6120900," I'm pretty sure it already crashed."
6120900,6127620," FillRect is not a function because it's not available in the WebGL context, of course."
6127620,6128980," So yeah."
6128980,6137380," And because all the pages are automatically created, right, even though you don't try to access them, if one of the pages fails, it's going to fail the whole application."
6137380,6138820," Again, it's not that difficult to fix."
6138820,6139940," Again, it's not that difficult to fix."
6139940,6141220," We just need to make them lazy."
6141220,6142340," Okay."
6142340,6145620," So it's not that difficult to fix."
6145620,6145940," All right."
6145940,6146260," All right."
6146260,6148980," So WebGL and everything seems to be initialized."
6148980,6155540," Maybe we can even do something like."
6155540,6157620," So this is the context."
6157620,6159860," And we usually call this thing JL."
6159860,6168020," And if it's not JL, we should usually we want to throw an error saying that we couldn't initialize this thing."
6168020,6174020," So then we enable the blending, the alpha blending and some other stuff."
6174020,6177620," So this is not WebGL initialization of any sort."
6177620,6184260," So then we're creating a mesh position for like rects and stuff like that."
6184260,6188820," So I might as well actually grab this entire thing."
6188820,6193380," So, yeah, as you can see, initializing WebGL is usually like a very, very painful process."
6193380,6196980," So it's just like a lot of code that you need to write."
6196980,6200900," And I usually just copy paste this code because I already wrote it once."
6200900,6202820," I don't want to write it like every time."
6202820,6203140," Right."
6203140,6204980," It's just like easier to copy paste this thing."
6204980,6206420," Okay."
6206420,6208820," And then we are organizing the event loop."
6208820,6210660," This one is interesting, actually."
6210660,6212260," We're organizing the event loop."
6212260,6214740," So where should we organize that event loop?"
6214740,6219220," We can organize it within the thing."
6219220,6226100," But maybe we don't need to organize it at all, to be fair, to be fair."
6226100,6233140," Maybe we can just render like one frame once and just call it day."
6233140,6234340," Why not?"
6236420,6237060," Yeah."
6237060,6245140," So the thing we need to do in here, we just need to set up the background color."
6245140,6248740," Set up the background color."
6248740,6250500," I wonder if we just set up the background color."
6250500,6251620," Will that be enough?"
6251620,6253460," I think."
6253460,6255620," I think yes."
6255620,6259460," So we can even get rid of the mesh position for now."
6259460,6260500," Right."
6260500,6263220," Let's just set the background color as the green one."
6263220,6264020," And if I refresh."
6264020,6264580," Yeah, there we go."
6264580,6265780," So here is the green color."
6265780,6266100," Right."
6266100,6268740," So that's pretty pogue."
6268740,6269540," I'm not going to lie."
6269540,6272660," But it would be interesting if we could render something with the shaders and whatnot."
6272660,6278020," Be interesting if we can render that with the shaders and whatnot."
6278020,6282020," So but to render the shaders, we need to be able to compile the shaders."
6282020,6282260," Right."
6282260,6288580," So we need something like compile shader source, link shader program, and so on and so forth."
6288580,6289460," All right."
6289460,6293300," So let me copy paste these chunks of code."
6293300,6295460," I don't know."
6295460,6302260," Maybe I'm going to create a separate file."
6302260,6303060," I don't know."
6303060,6303220," I don't know."
6303220,6304020," I don't know."
6304020,6307220," I'm going to copy paste this stuff in here."
6307220,6318580," So and I suppose the another thing we want to do, the another thing is just a mesh position."
6318580,6335540," We want to initialize mesh position, maybe I'm going to have a separate function for that."
6335540,6345140," But since it's a static draw, right, since it's a static draw, maybe it doesn't really matter."
6345140,6345380," Okay."
6345380,6355460," Let's go to WebGL and create a function something like prepare mesh position attribute."
6355460,6355700," Right."
6355700,6359140," So in here we're going to be putting this kind of stuff."
6359140,6363220," We're going to need that stuff."
6364100,6364500," Okay."
6364500,6370180," So mesh position attribute."
6370180,6375780," And after that I'm going to be just drawing this kind of stuff."
6375780,6379220," All right."
6379220,6381700," Let's see how many errors we're going to see in here."
6381700,6383300," Triangle pair is not implemented."
6383300,6383540," Okay."
6383540,6389860," So this is basically means that I need to add WebGL.js in here."
6389860,6390180," Right."
6390660,6395140," And okay, we don't have invalid shaders or anything like that."
6395140,6395380," Okay."
6395380,6398900," So maybe we need to implement some shaders."
6398900,6400740," Let's see what kind of shaders we can implement."
6400740,6402740," Maybe we can steal some of the shaders."
6402740,6405700," What kind of shaders we can steal?"
6405700,6414100," So the first one, I think I'm going to take a look at the shaking one, which is the heart one."
6414100,6414420," Right."
6414420,6419060," So I'm going to just steal this entire thing into WebGL."
6419780,6420180," All right."
6420180,6422260," So here it is."
6422260,6426980," So this is the vertex shader source code."
6429460,6442100," And this is going to be the end and this is going to be fragment shader source."
6442100,6445380," It's going to put it like that."
6445380,6446500," Fragment shader source."
6446500,6449380," And this one is going to be just that."
6449380,6452740," So here's the vertex and fragment shader sources."
6453860,6456340," So we prepare a mesh position attribute."
6456340,6458900," And maybe another thing we want to do, we want to prepare shaders."
6458900,6463220," Function prepare shaders."
6463220,6463540," Right."
6463540,6471860," And in here, what we're going to be doing is compile shader source."
6472980,6474580," So we're going to be compiling these things."
6474580,6482180," Vertex shader source."
6482180,6485460," Fragment shader source."
6485460,6488180," All right."
6488180,6492900," And then we link the program and we use this program."
6492900,6493540," Okay, cool."
6493540,6498660," We link the program and we use this program."
6498660,6501300," So do we need anything else, I suppose?"
6501300,6502340," I don't think so."
6502340,6504260," So here is the mesh position."
6504260,6506740," We just use the mesh position for the original position."
6506740,6508660," Everything in here can be removed."
6508660,6510340," We don't have a resolution and time."
6510340,6511860," Only mesh position in UV."
6511860,6513540," Here is UV."
6513540,6518980," And in UV, I suppose in UV, we want to render something new."
6518980,6523940," So for now, I think I'm going to do something like this."
6526500,6534420," So GLFragColor is going to be just the four zero zero one."
6534420,6534740," All right."
6534740,6535540," So it's going to do that."
6535540,6541860," Sorry."
6541860,6542900," I don't know what happened to me."
6544420,6547380," And yeah, so we're preparing the shaders and shit like that."
6547380,6547620," Okay."
6547620,6551940," So we need to prepare some other stuff."
6551940,6554340," Some other stuff."
6554340,6558740," So let's go in here."
6560980,6561540," All right."
6561540,6563940," So prepare mesh position attribute."
6563940,6567940," Prepare shaders."
6567940,6571940," So we'll need this."
6571940,6572500," JL."
6572500,6574580," And let's see how miserably it fails."
6574580,6575780," Okay."
6575780,6577140," So 56."
6577140,6579300," Actually a different thing."
6579300,6580020," 56."
6580020,6582420," JL is not defined."
6582420,6582740," Wait."
6582740,6582980," What?"
6582980,6585220," JL is not defined."
6585220,6585780," Really?"
6585780,6586260," Didn't I?"
6586260,6586500," Okay."
6586500,6587540," I forgot to save this thing."
6587540,6588580," All right."
6588580,6590100," Vertex attribute is not defined."
6590100,6590340," Okay."
6590340,6591140," Let's grab it."
6591140,6593140," Vertex attribute."
6593140,6596420," Where is it defined?"
6596420,6596740," Okay."
6596740,6598420," So it's essentially this thing."
6598420,6600820," I'm going to put it in here."
6600820,6602900," So it's available to everyone."
6602900,6605860," All right."
6605860,6607300," And shader is actually working."
6607300,6610340," Because we're setting the color red inside of the shader."
6610340,6611380," Okay."
6611380,6612820," This is precisely what I wanted to see."
6612820,6613700," So I can set blue."
6613700,6614420," And it's going to be blue."
6614420,6615700," So that means we control the shader."
6615700,6617540," So we can actually do some interesting shit."
6617540,6619220," For example."
6619220,6620020," HSL."
6620020,6620340," All right."
6620340,6622100," So if we have HSL to RGB."
6622100,6623460," All right."
6623460,6624340," And then."
6624340,6626580," In here."
6626580,6628580," We can just use this as the color."
6628580,6630820," Like a rainbow color."
6630820,6632900," All right."
6632900,6634660," So this is the rainbow color."
6634660,6635780," It's based on the time."
6635780,6638260," But I didn't think we have any time."
6638260,6639060," So it's going to be just."
6639060,6640260," You know."
6640260,6640980," A rainbow."
6640980,6643700," And yeah."
6643700,6644260," There we go."
6644260,6644980," We have a rainbow."
6644980,6646260," Nice."
6646260,6646740," Nice."
6646740,6647220," Nice."
6647220,6647780," Nice."
6647780,6648100," Nice."
6648100,6648420," Nice."
6648420,6648740," Nice."
6648740,6648980," Nice."
6648980,6649060," Nice."
6649060,6652020," And this rainbow is actually generated on GPU."
6652020,6654020," So yeah."
6654020,6655140," We can wrap."
6655140,6657140," Sort of like WebGL."
6657140,6658580," Our WebGL code."
6658580,6661140," Into this sort of like attack component."
6661140,6663780," It's not that hard."
6663780,6664100," All right."
6664100,6666500," You just have to perform the calls and stuff like that."
6666500,6669300," But it will be interesting to explore."
6669300,6675300," How to expose some methods to actually supply a texture for the WebGL."
6675300,6678100," How to supply different filters and whatnot."
6678100,6681860," But I think this is a pretty good base for what I'm trying to implement."
6681860,6683380," I think it's a pretty good base."
6683380,6685140," So let me actually do a committee committee."
6685140,6686820," So."
6686820,6689780," I think we don't use this thing."
6689780,6692420," All right."
6697780,6705540," implement router and several pages with several things."
6705540,6706980," All right."
6706980,6708980," And I'm going to push that right into the repo."
6709620,6713140," So I'm going to put the repo in the description."
6713140,6713540," Of course."
6713540,6718340," The repo is going to be available after the vote is out."
6718340,6719460," Right."
6719460,6722740," So to not spoil things for people who follow me on GitHub."
6722740,6724580," It's not going to be published right away."
6724580,6725540," So."
6725540,6729380," It's going to be available a little bit later."
6729380,6730340," So."
6730340,6732340," Source code tag."
6732340,6733860," JS."
6733860,6736180," It's not the official name of the framework."
6736180,6736420," Right."
6736420,6738340," It's not the official name of the framework."
6739380,6740180," It's a code name."
6740180,6743060," I haven't come up with the official name yet."
6743060,6744100," It's a secret."
6744100,6746100," But yeah."
6746100,6752180," That's basically the sketch of the framework that I want to implement."
6752180,6752740," Right."
6752740,6753300," So it's."
6753300,6756500," I'm not claiming that this is like a ready to use framework."
6756500,6759140," I literally implemented it in two hours."
6759140,6760740," Live."
6760740,6761300," Well."
6761300,6761860," Kind of live."
6761860,6763220," Like on the recording."
6763220,6763380," So."
6763380,6766340," It's obviously not finished."
6766340,6766740," So."
6766740,6767460," Just a warning."
6767460,6768980," Don't think it's a finished product."
6768980,6770740," I just implemented it."
6770740,6773380," I just pulled it out of my ass."
6773380,6774500," So."
6774500,6777300," Do you want to use something that was just pulled out of the ass?"
6777300,6777700," No."
6777700,6778420," You want it."
6778420,6779220," You want it to polish."
6779220,6781060," You want to polish the shit."
6781060,6782980," Until it's shiny."
6782980,6784180," Anyway."
6784180,6786340," I think today was a pretty good sesh."
6786340,6788660," I think today was a pretty good sesh."
6788660,6790820," Thanks everyone who's watching me right now."
6790820,6792340," I really appreciate it."
6792340,6793700," Have a good one."
6793700,6794980," And I see you all tomorrow."
6794980,6796580," Tomorrow we're going to do game development."
6796580,6799620," Because tomorrow we're supposed to be doing web development."
6799620,6801540," But I decided to do web development today."
6801540,6804580," So tomorrow is going to be game development in C++."
6804580,6807460," Thanks everyone for all the support."
6807460,6808500," For all the nations."
6808500,6810100," I really appreciate it."
6810100,6811380," And yeah."
6811380,6812420," I'm going to go."
6812420,6813300," I'm going to go."
6813300,6815300," Thanks everyone for watching."
6815300,6816180," Love you."
6816180,6817180," Mwah."
