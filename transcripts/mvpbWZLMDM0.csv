0,6540," Hello and welcome to another totting session."
6540,12400," So today is Monday, if I'm not mistaken, today is Monday."
12400,19240," And today, according to the schedule, we're doing web development and we continue developing Emote Jam."
19240,27740," And Emote Jam is a simple website where you can upload sort of like emote or static image of an emote, right?"
27740,29960," And apply some different filters to it."
30000,34460," It's jumping backwards, yeah."
34460,46400," And after you apply certain filters to it, you can render this entire thing and download the final GIF where you can upload it to BTTV or other third party things."
46400,53260," So it's completely open source, you can find the source code of this thing on GitHub, I'm going to put all of that into the description."
53260,59740," So let's quickly do that and today we're going to simply continue developing this thing because it's Web Development Monday, that's what it is."
59740,62200," That's what it is, that's what it is."
62200,68200," Okay, so it's going to be Emote Jam and I'm going to give you the link to the website."
68200,69200," Right."
69200,74200," And Emote Jam source code, there we go, there we go."
74200,76660," Here it is."
76660,81660," So let's actually try to go to the source code of Emote Jam and let's fetch the latest stuff."
81660,89120," So we have some changes in here, so I don't think they are needed."
89120,91120," Let me try to fetch the latest stuff."
91120,98580," So, I think, yeah, I think we're up to date."
98580,101580," So if I try to do so, yeah, we're completely up to date."
101580,106580," Okay, let me try to run this entire thing locally with the Python 3."
106580,109040," HTTP server 69, 60."
109040,113040," Well, I mean, I should have actually run it with asynchronous mode."
113040,117040," And now if I open it locally here, it is locally."
117040,123700," So, it doesn't really require any particular backend or any HTTP server per se, but because"
123700,130040," of the, you know, modern web development and course stuff, you kind of have to like serve"
130040,132040," it via an HTTP server."
132040,140040," So, yeah, you can actually upload any, any image in here, which is kind of funny."
140040,141040," Right."
141040,146040," So, it can, it can literally accept any image, even GIFs, but it doesn't really animate GIFs."
146040,149040," This is something that I wanted to fix at some point."
149040,154040," But apparently, if you are uploading a GIF, right."
154040,161040," So, if you have an image element in a DOM and the SRC of that image element points to a GIF,"
161040,170040," right, apparently from a JavaScript, you can't that easily get the frames of that GIF."
170040,179040," So, what you have to do, you have to load the GIF file as bytes and parse GIF format manually."
179040,182040," And there are libraries that can do that for you."
182040,187040," And it's just like really weird, because obviously, like you have a GIF in the browser."
187040,195040," That means browser managed to parse that GIF and extract the frames and render the frames in a sequence over time."
195040,199040," And it's just like something that you cannot have an access to from a JavaScript."
199040,203040," And that seems to me completely insane."
203040,204040," Right."
204040,208040," So, you can have so much access from a JavaScript."
208040,209040," Right."
209040,216040," But you can't have an access to such simple thing as frames of GIFs that browser already parsed for you."
216040,222040," Maybe I'm missing something, but a quick Google app just show that no, it's not a thing that you can do."
222040,226040," You have to like grab the bytes of the file and parse them manually."
226040,229040," And it's just like, bruh."
229040,230040," Seriously?"
230040,233040," I actually spit it all over the place because of that."
233040,234040," Holy shit."
234040,237040," So, web development, am I right?"
237040,241040," So, anyway, because of that, I'm not going to be working on that."
241040,244040," So, I want to work on something different today."
244040,250040," So, you see there are filters in here."
250040,253040," And those filters are essentially hot coded."
253040,262040," For example, if you have this bounce thingy, you cannot control how high and how quickly the emote will bounce."
262040,265040," But it would be cool if you could, you know."
265040,271040," Essentially, if you select a particular filter, it would just maybe show some sliders in here"
271040,276040," or some way to input the parameters of the like amplitude and frequency."
276040,279040," And it would change like in real time."
279040,282040," And you can like adjust it while looking at it."
282040,286040," And then you could render it and it would be like exactly as you want."
286040,290040," So, and because of that, by the way, maybe some of the filters will be completely eliminated"
290040,297040," because we have filter for hop, then hopper, which is slightly faster and overheat, which is the fastest."
297040,300040," So, if you could just control the speed of hopping."
300040,304040," Like you could basically remove like hopper and overheat."
304040,306040," You just won't need them at all."
306040,307040," Right."
307040,308040," So, yeah."
308040,313040," If the filters were customizable, we could reduce the amount of filters."
313040,317040," So, and that's precisely what I want to work on today."
317040,323040," So, right now the filters are defined as a JSON object."
323040,324040," Right."
324040,328040," So, here for instance, a single filter."
328040,329040," Hope."
329040,333040," It consists of what is going to be considered a transparent color."
333040,336040," Then the duration of the GIF."
336040,338040," Then the vertex shader."
338040,339040," Right."
339040,341040," And then the fragment shader."
341040,342040," And there we go."
342040,344040," So, what I want to implement in here."
344040,347040," I want to introduce another field in here."
347040,352040," Let's actually select a simpler filter to work with."
352040,355040," I think the hard filter would be a little bit easier."
355040,358040," Despite its name, I think it would be a little bit easier."
358040,362040," So, the hard filter is essentially takes the static image."
362040,365040," It zooms it in a little bit and starts shaking it."
365040,366040," Right."
366040,367040," So, yeah."
367040,368040," That's basically what it is."
368040,375040," And for this particular filter, I would like to customize how closer it's zoomed in or zoomed out."
375040,377040," How quickly it shakes."
377040,380040," And how violently basically the amplitude of shaking."
380040,383040," So, the shaking right now is just actually circular motion."
383040,384040," It's a quick circular motion."
384040,388040," And maybe it could be something more random."
388040,389040," But I guess it's fine."
389040,392040," And so, these three parameters, I want them to be customizable."
392040,395040," And they're pretty easy to integrate into the main shaders."
395040,396040," So, we're going to work with it hard."
396040,397040," Alright."
397040,400040," So, we're going to have something like params."
400040,403040," And what kind of params do I want to have in here?"
403040,405040," I already have a zoom."
405040,406040," There you go."
406040,408040," So, here are the parameters."
408040,409040," Literally."
409040,410040," Here are the parameters."
410040,412040," Zoom, intensity, and amplitude."
412040,417040," So, let's quickly do that, essentially."
417040,419040," So, we're going to have a zoom."
419040,424040," Then, intensity, and amplitude."
424040,425040," Right."
425040,435040," So, and essentially, once you define those parameters in the params field, these things should be available as uniforms."
435040,437040," As uniforms in your shader."
437040,438040," Right."
438040,441040," Something like that."
441040,442040," Right."
442040,443040," Just a second."
443040,444040," One, two, three."
444040,445040," And a boom, boom."
445040,446040," There we go."
446040,450040," So, and then you will be able to completely get rid of them from the shader."
450040,456040," So, now, the user is in charge of those things."
456040,457040," Right."
457040,459040," The user is in charge of those things."
459040,464040," So, but again, different sort of parameters could have different types."
464040,472040," And I suppose one of the things we want to do in here, we want to be able to specify, like define, what's going to be the type of those parameters."
472040,473040," Right."
473040,476040," So, let me actually reformat everything."
476040,479040," So, I suppose this one's going to be something like type."
479040,481040," And all of them are going to be float."
481040,487040," So, I suppose we're going to support, like, the types of JLSL."
487040,488040," Right."
488040,492040," So, it could be a float, integer, maybe vectors."
492040,493040," Who knows?"
493040,495040," That would be actually kind of cool."
495040,497040," So, and how would you select a vector?"
497040,499040," It actually depends."
499040,505040," Maybe it could be like a point on the emote."
505040,506040," Right."
506040,510040," You maybe select like a fixed point of the emote, like some sort of a pivot if you are rotating."
510040,511040," Right."
511040,514040," So, you're making a rotation filter and you want to select the pivot."
514040,515040," Right."
515040,520040," So, that parameter could be actually displayed on the canvas itself."
520040,525040," So, you would actually see the point on the canvas and you would be able to drag it around."
525040,530040," And then this point disappears when you like render the final thing."
530040,532040," But right now, we're not going to implement that."
532040,535040," Right now, we're going to only implement like simple things like floats."
535040,539040," And another thing in the future we're going to implement is probably colors."
539040,540040," Right."
540040,541040," We're going to customize the colors."
541040,545040," And as far as I know, HTML5 has a color picker element."
545040,546040," Color picker element."
546040,547040," So, yeah."
547040,553040," We'll be able to utilize this kind of stuff."
553040,555040," Is that a color?"
555040,557040," No, it's not a color picker."
557040,558040," Yeah."
558040,565040," So, basically, you take an input tag and you put a type of this tag as color and it becomes a color picker."
565040,566040," Essentially."
566040,567040," But anyway."
567040,573040," So, those things are going to have like type float."
573040,579040," And I suppose one of the things you want to have for your filter is the default parameters."
579040,580040," Right."
580040,583040," So, what's going to be the default parameter of this stuff?"
583040,589040," So, maybe it's going to be called either default or init."
589040,594040," I think default is a little bit like more straightforward, I would say."
594040,596040," So, zoom is 1.4."
596040,602040," Then, for the intensity, we have 32."
602040,603040," Right."
603040,604040," It's going to be 32."
604040,612040," And for the amplitude, for the amplitude, it was going to be 1 over 8."
612040,616040," But for now, I guess it's fine."
616040,620040," But in the future, I want to do the following thing."
620040,629040," I want to be able to actually export and import these filters as a JSON file."
629040,634040," So, basically, you may work on your filter in the website."
634040,636040," We're going to have tools for developing filters."
636040,639040," And then at some point, you want to just basically export it."
639040,640040," Right."
640040,642040," And then you want to share it with somebody."
642040,649040," So, they will be able to take your JSON file and basically import it into their Emolgem website."
649040,654040," So, essentially, this is needed because this website doesn't have a back-end."
654040,655040," Right."
655040,656040," So, it's completely client-sized."
656040,661040," And because of that, we cannot store any of these things on the back-end and easily share these things."
661040,668040," So, if we try to do that, the scope of the project will basically move towards something like more social,"
668040,670040," which I don't really want to involve into."
670040,677040," So, yeah, I just want to make a simple thing that can work in as many platforms as possible in 2021."
677040,678040," Right."
678040,686040," Because in 2021, if you want a truly cross-platform application, you have to program that shady in that modern interpreted language called JavaScript."
686040,687040," Right."
687040,691040," So, and there's pretty much no way to escape that."
691040,692040," So, yeah."
692040,696040," So, yeah."
696040,700040," And since I'm going to be exporting these things as files."
700040,701040," Right."
701040,704040," So, how do I express these kind of things?"
704040,708040," For example, some of the values wants to be expressions."
708040,709040," Right."
709040,714040," I could probably just let them to be expressions."
714040,717040," And then when I need to interpret them, I could use evolve."
717040,727040," But it feels like a security breach because anyone could craft a filter file with arbitrary like JSON execution."
727040,736040," So, if somebody takes their, like somebody's filter and upload it to their website, it may try to do things that the user may not want to do."
736040,737040," So, yeah."
737040,742040," On the other hand, like what exactly they can do?"
742040,746040," Well, it depends on which domain this entire thing is deployed."
746040,747040," Right."
747040,758040," So, if it's deployed on some domain from which the JavaScript can steal some cookies and send somewhere because of some like faulty course policies, it could be a real problem."
758040,769040," So, one of the things I was thinking about is that maybe I can implement like a very simple, you know, expression parser."
769040,770040," Right."
770040,774040," So, essentially, if you want to have an expression, you can just put something like this in here."
774040,780040," And our simple expression parser will just parse it, make it an IST, interpret it and calculate it."
780040,782040," So, yeah."
782040,785040," But it's outside of the scope of what we're doing right now."
785040,787040," So, for now, we're going to just keep it like that."
787040,791040," We don't have exporting of JSON right now anyway."
791040,795040," So, I guess it's fine to just keep it like that."
795040,796040," And I already do that."
796040,800040," You see duration is calculated like as an expression."
800040,808040," Another interesting thing, by the way, I want to be able to calculate the expression in terms of these parameters as well."
808040,816040," I want to be able to say something like the duration is going to be amplitude multiplied by pi plus something something."
816040,826040," And it's quite important to be able to express durations as an expression because you need to make a duration so your emote loops seamlessly."
826040,827040," Right."
827040,836040," So, and because of that, you need to use an expression because depending on the parameters, the actual duration to make it seamless might differ."
836040,844040," If your intensity is very low, to make the emote loop, you need to have bigger time."
844040,850040," If your intensity is smaller, you need bigger time."
850040,855040," If intensity is bigger, you need smaller time because it will just loop a little bit faster."
855040,865040," So, yeah, I'm actually basically thinking about implementing my own like simple language where you can put expressions like that."
865040,867040," So, I think it's not that hard to implement."
867040,868040," I implemented programming languages before."
868040,869040," It shouldn't be that difficult."
869040,876040," Maybe we can even utilize WebAssembly in here."
876040,884040," So, essentially, maybe we're going to write a simple module in C or in Rust, which accepts a string as an expression."
884040,892040," And in the WebAssembly context, it basically parses the string and evaluates it for you very, very fast."
892040,895040," And then the JavaScript can just take the result and put it there."
895040,902040," That way, it's not only like sandboxed, but it's completely separated from the JavaScript context."
902040,905040," Because inside of the WebAssembly, you cannot do anything right."
905040,916040," So, if you're going to have some sort of like segmentation faults, usually WebAssembly runtime doesn't really do anything super dangerous."
916040,919040," It just crashes the WebAssembly context."
919040,922040," But yeah, it's just random thoughts that I have."
922040,924040," It's just random thoughts that I have."
924040,927040," Just a second."
927040,930040," I think I want to pour a bottle of water."
930040,933040," I forgot to do that before the stream, unfortunately."
933040,936040," All right."
936040,937040," Let's continue."
937040,938040," I've got my water."
938040,953040," And what we need to do is just, I suppose, when we're compiling the filter, we just need to grab these parameters and turn them into UI elements."
953040,955040," I think that's going to be cool."
955040,956040," Cheers."
956040,974040," So, another thing I'm thinking about is that do we want to have some sort of like titles in there or can we use just the name of those things?"
974040,975040," I don't know."
975040,976040," I guess it's fine."
976040,977040," I guess it's fine."
977040,979040," I guess it's fine to use the names."
979040,983040," So, here's the parameters."
983040,986040," Do I need anything else in here?"
986040,989040," Title, probably not important right now."
989040,990040," Okay."
990040,992040," Maybe some ranges, available ranges."
992040,998040," That could be interesting, especially if you're going to define like a slider."
998040,999040," Right?"
999040,1000040," Okay."
1000040,1001040," Can HTML5 do slider?"
1001040,1004040," HTML input slider."
1004040,1007040," Is that a thing you can have?"
1007040,1008040," Range slider."
1008040,1010040," So, there is a range."
1010040,1011040," All right."
1011040,1013040," How does it look like?"
1013040,1016040," Is there like try..."
1016040,1019040," Try it yourself."
1019040,1020040," Okay."
1020040,1024040," So, there is this range and..."
1024040,1025040," Yeah."
1025040,1026040," Okay."
1026040,1027040," Cool."
1027040,1031040," So, we can have ranges as well, but not for now."
1031040,1032040," Let's actually try to do something."
1032040,1035040," How do we compile or like load filter?"
1035040,1036040," Yeah, there we go."
1036040,1040040," So, there's a special function called load filter program."
1040040,1044040," One of the things we can do in here is probably the following thing."
1044040,1045040," Okay."
1045040,1046040," So, here are the uniforms."
1046040,1047040," Right?"
1047040,1050040," So, we have a resolution, time, emote, size, uniform."
1050040,1059040," And I'm thinking is that maybe, just maybe, we need to put all of the uniforms under its own like umbrella."
1059040,1060040," Right?"
1060040,1061040," So, it's going to be uniform."
1061040,1064040," Uniform."
1064040,1067040," And all of the uniforms will go here."
1067040,1068040," Right?"
1068040,1074040," And because of that, maybe we don't even need to prefix the names of the uniforms with the word uniform."
1074040,1078040," Because we know for a fact that they are uniforms."
1078040,1079040," Right?"
1079040,1082040," We don't need to prefix anything here."
1082040,1083040," So, it's going to be just that."
1083040,1089040," So, it's going to be resolution, time, emote, size, and so on and so forth."
1089040,1092040," So, these are hardcoded uniforms."
1092040,1093040," All right."
1093040,1098040," How can we, how can we call them?"
1098040,1102040," I think we can call them something like built-in uniforms."
1102040,1103040," Right?"
1103040,1105040," So, this is built-in uniforms."
1105040,1107040," Right."
1111040,1112040," built-in uniforms."
1112040,1118040," And what I want to create here, I want to create the filter uniforms."
1118040,1119040," Right?"
1119040,1121040," So, it's going to be filter uniforms."
1121040,1123040," It's going to be something like this."
1123040,1126040," And what I'm going to be doing in here, I'm going to be taking."
1126040,1131040," So, param of filter params."
1131040,1132040," Right?"
1132040,1133040," So, param of filter params."
1133040,1137040," Maybe it's going to be something like param name in filter params."
1137040,1138040," All right."
1138040,1143040," And I'm going to be appending those parameters into the uniform."
1143040,1144040," Right?"
1144040,1145040," Right."
1145040,1146040," So, how am I going to be doing that?"
1146040,1151040," So, it's going to be filter uniform param name."
1151040,1163040," is going to be equal to gl get uniform location id param name."
1163040,1164040," There we go."
1164040,1168040," So, now we have built-in uniforms and filter uniforms."
1168040,1171040," And I want to somehow merge them together."
1171040,1173040," And I wonder how do you do that in JavaScript."
1173040,1176040," JavaScript merge two objects."
1176040,1177040," Let's find out."
1177040,1180040," How to merge two objects in JavaScript."
1180040,1183040," Is there a thing you can do?"
1183040,1185040," All right."
1185040,1186040," We're off to the good start."
1186040,1189040," Because you need a video to explain this kind of shit to you."
1189040,1193040," ES16 introduced spread operator."
1193040,1194040," Okay."
1194040,1195040," So, but what if..."
1195040,1199040," The best solution in this case is to use load dash and it's..."
1199040,1203040," Okay."
1203040,1205040," So, it's a yet another unsolved problem of computer science."
1205040,1207040," Along with centering elements."
1207040,1208040," Or something."
1209040,1212040," Oh, web people."
1212040,1214040," It's not that hard."
1214040,1216040," How can you merge properties of two?"
1216040,1217040," All right."
1217040,1219040," I guess I can just push them into like..."
1219040,1221040," Into the final uniforms."
1221040,1222040," I don't fucking know."
1222040,1223040," Um..."
1223040,1224040," Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm."
1224040,1225040," All right."
1225040,1226040," Okay."
1226040,1227040," Let's see."
1227040,1228040," So, this is going to be something like this."
1228040,1229040," Uniforms."
1229040,1230040," Uniforms."
1230040,1231040," And I think I can keep it cost because I'm not really reassigning it anyway."
1231040,1232040," Right."
1232040,1233040," And then it's going to be uniforms."
1233040,1234040," Uniforms."
1234040,1235040," Uniforms."
1235040,1236040," Uniforms."
1236040,1240040," And I think I can keep it cost because I'm not really reassigning it anyway."
1240040,1241040," Right."
1241040,1243040," And then it's going to be uniforms."
1243040,1244040," Um..."
1244040,1247040," And that's pretty much it, actually."
1247040,1251040," So, we have built-in uniforms and you have the filter uniforms."
1251040,1254040," And because of that, you don't really need to do anything in here."
1254040,1255040," You just..."
1255040,1256040," Yeah."
1256040,1257040," You just collected all of the uniforms."
1257040,1258040," There we go."
1258040,1259040," Um..."
1259040,1262040," So, I'm also thinking if..."
1262040,1266040," Param name is in uniforms."
1266040,1267040," Right."
1267040,1268040," Is in uniforms."
1268040,1269040," Uh..."
1269040,1271040," We probably need to throw some sort of an error."
1271040,1272040," Uh..."
1272040,1273040," Indicating that, uh..."
1273040,1280040," You're trying to redefine already existing parameters or already existing uniforms."
1280040,1281040," Um..."
1281040,1283040," So, what's going to be the best way to do that?"
1283040,1285040," By the way, does in even work?"
1285040,1286040," I don't remember."
1286040,1287040," I'm not a web developer."
1287040,1288040," So, I don't know."
1288040,1289040," Uh..."
1289040,1292040," So, if I have some sort of an object like full 69."
1292040,1296040," And if I do something like is full in here."
1296040,1297040," Okay."
1297040,1298040," Is this in here?"
1298040,1299040," Okay."
1299040,1300040," So, it's not."
1300040,1301040," So, it's quite easy to check it like that."
1301040,1302040," Uh..."
1302040,1303040," Throw new error."
1303040,1304040," Right."
1304040,1306040," And what new error accepts?"
1306040,1308040," It accepts just a string."
1308040,1309040," Okay."
1309040,1310040," Uh..."
1310040,1311040," Rediff..."
1311040,1312040," Uh..."
1312040,1317040," Redefinition of existing, uh..."
1317040,1318040," Uniform parameter."
1318040,1319040," Uh..."
1319040,1320040," Parameter."
1320040,1323040," And we're going to assign param name."
1323040,1324040," Param name."
1324040,1325040," There we go."
1325040,1327040," So, that should never happen."
1327040,1331040," So, if something like that happens, that means you have a faulty filter."
1331040,1332040," Um..."
1332040,1333040," Yeah."
1333040,1334040," Okay."
1334040,1335040," Cool."
1335040,1336040," Um..."
1336040,1336040," Okay."
1336040,1337040," Cool."
1337040,1338040," Um..."
1338040,1339040," So, now..."
1339040,1340040," Um..."
1340040,1345040," I want to try to run this entire thing."
1345040,1346040," And, um..."
1346040,1347040," See..."
1347040,1348040," If it compiles or not."
1348040,1350040," Because right now, I probably broke a lot of things."
1350040,1351040," Uh..."
1351040,1354040," So, let me actually find the hard filter."
1354040,1355040," Um..."
1355040,1359040," And I wanna kinda remove this stuff for now."
1359040,1360040," And just keep it like this."
1360040,1366040," Because we don't really pass this sort of information to the uniforms yet."
1366040,1367040," We don't pass it yet."
1367040,1368040," But we will."
1368040,1369040," Um..."
1369040,1370040," Um..."
1370040,1373040," So, and let's go to the localhost69."
1373040,1375040," Maybe I already have it open somewhere."
1375040,1377040," So, this is the remote one."
1377040,1379040," And I need..."
1379040,1380040," Uh..."
1380040,1384040," I need the local one."
1384040,1385040," Okay."
1385040,1386040," So, it's broken."
1386040,1387040," Uh..."
1387040,1388040," As expected, actually."
1388040,1389040," Um..."
1389040,1390040," So..."
1390040,1391040," 9..."
1391040,1392040," 938."
1392040,1393040," 938."
1393040,1394040," And..."
1394040,1395040," Uh..."
1395040,1396040," What is it talking about?"
1396040,1397040," Uniform is not defined."
1397040,1398040," Because it's ""uniforms""."
1398040,1399040," Okay."
1399040,1400040," Uniforms."
1400040,1401040," Okay."
1401040,1402040," Uniforms."
1402040,1403040," Do we have anything else?"
1403040,1404040," Okay."
1404040,1405040," Everything seems to be working."
1405040,1406040," But it's not moving anywhere."
1406040,1407040," Which is kind of interesting."
1407040,1409040," And it's not broken at all."
1409040,1414040," It doesn't even throw any error!"
1414040,1420040," How am I supposed to debug anything if it just silently doesn't work?"
1420040,1421040," Uh..."
1421040,1426040," Nice one, JavaScript."
1426040,1427040," Nice one, JavaScript."
1427040,1429040," Thank you very much."
1429040,1430040," Ah..."
1430040,1432040," So, I kind of know what's going on in here."
1432040,1433040," Right."
1433040,1437040," So, I probably have to search for ""jluniform""."
1437040,1438040," Yeah."
1438040,1439040," For this one."
1439040,1440040," Right."
1440040,1441040," And essentially..."
1441040,1442040," Um..."
1442040,1445040," Is that the only two places where we set ""jluniform""?"
1445040,1446040," Let's actually..."
1446040,1447040," Let me find all of them."
1447040,1448040," Uh..."
1448040,1449040," Okay."
1449040,1452040," So, we set time and resolution uniform."
1452040,1453040," Uh..."
1453040,1454040," And in here..."
1454040,1456040," So, this is the rendering loop."
1456040,1457040," Uh..."
1457040,1458040," Emote size uniform."
1458040,1459040," Surprisingly..."
1459040,1460040," Surprisingly..."
1460040,1461040," We don't really set..."
1461040,1462040," Huh..."
1462040,1466040," We don't really set emote size."
1466040,1467040," Okay."
1467040,1468040," So, which is incorrect."
1468040,1473040," Which actually will introduce a bug during rendering of the GIF."
1473040,1474040," Okay."
1474040,1475040," So, that's very interesting."
1475040,1476040," Uh..."
1476040,1477040," Jluniform."
1477040,1478040," Uh..."
1478040,1479040," Uniform."
1479040,1480040," Uniform."
1480040,1481040," Okay."
1481040,1482040," So, here's that."
1482040,1483040," So, emote size."
1483040,1484040," And..."
1484040,1486040," Do we even have..."
1486040,1489040," Have emote image when we're rendering this into..."
1489040,1490040," I think..."
1490040,1491040," I think we do."
1491040,1492040," Um..."
1492040,1493040," So, this is just a render."
1493040,1494040," Alright."
1494040,1495040," Alright."
1495040,1496040," Alright."
1496040,1497040," Um..."
1497040,1500040," And this one has to be something like this."
1500040,1501040," So, we're gonna do..."
1501040,1502040," Uniforms."
1502040,1503040," Uniforms."
1503040,1504040," Um..."
1504040,1505040," And..."
1505040,1506040," Also..."
1506040,1508040," It's gonna be something like this."
1508040,1509040," There we go."
1509040,1510040," So, yeah."
1510040,1511040," Uniform time."
1511040,1512040," We set the time."
1512040,1513040," Uniform resolution."
1513040,1514040," Uniform."
1514040,1515040," Emote size."
1515040,1517040," And we set everything accordingly."
1517040,1521040," So, let's try to find the other uniforms in here now."
1521040,1522040," Uh..."
1522040,1523040," Uh..."
1523040,1524040," Uh..."
1524040,1525040," Okay."
1525040,1526040," Uh..."
1526040,1527040," Uh-huh."
1527040,1528040," Uh-huh."
1528040,1529040," Hmm."
1529040,1530040," Hmm."
1530040,1531040," Alright."
1531040,1532040," Alright."
1532040,1533040," Alright."
1533040,1534040," Alright."
1534040,1535040," Alright."
1535040,1537040," So, this is gonna be something like this."
1537040,1538040," And..."
1538040,1539040," Uh..."
1539040,1541040," This is gonna be something like that."
1541040,1542040," There we go."
1542040,1543040," There we go."
1543040,1544040," Hmm..."
1544040,1545040," Hmm..."
1545040,1546040," Hmm..."
1546040,1547040," Hmm..."
1547040,1549040," So, that should now work."
1549040,1550040," And..."
1550040,1551040," I think it is working."
1551040,1552040," Uh..."
1552040,1553040," I think it is working."
1553040,1556040," So, if I try to switch to different things now."
1556040,1557040," Uh..."
1557040,1558040," I'm switching to different..."
1558040,1559040," Uh..."
1559040,1560040," filters."
1560040,1562040," And specifically, I wanna take a look at heart."
1562040,1563040," Uh..."
1563040,1564040," There we go."
1564040,1565040," It seems to be working."
1565040,1567040," If I render this entire thing."
1567040,1568040," Um..."
1568040,1570040," Cannot read property time of undefined."
1570040,1571040," Hmm..."
1571040,1572040," Interesting."
1572040,1574040," So, let's go to 1:1:27."
1574040,1575040," And..."
1575040,1576040," Um..."
1576040,1577040," That's very strange."
1577040,1579040," Why it doesn't have any time?"
1579040,1584040," Even though we do have time when we're previewing this entire thing."
1584040,1585040," I think."
1585040,1586040," So..."
1586040,1587040," Program uniforms."
1587040,1588040," Okay."
1588040,1589040," So..."
1589040,1591040," That means it's called differently."
1591040,1592040," Wait."
1592040,1593040," What?"
1593040,1597040," Am I going crazy?"
1597040,1598040," Ah..."
1598040,1599040," I'm..."
1599040,1600040," I am actually."
1600040,1603040," I forgot to put S in here."
1603040,1604040," Oh boy."
1604040,1605040," Alright."
1605040,1606040," So..."
1606040,1608040," Cannot read property of time undefined."
1608040,1619040," Oh!"
1619040,1620040," JavaScript!"
1620040,1621040," Okay."
1621040,1622040," So..."
1622040,1623040," Alright."
1623040,1624040," It's going."
1624040,1625040," We're going places."
1625040,1626040," Nice."
1626040,1627040," Uh..."
1627040,1628040," Cool."
1628040,1632040," But Zazen, why are you not using TypeScript?"
1632040,1633040," Oh!"
1633040,1634040," Oh!"
1634040,1635040," TypeScript!"
1635040,1636040," Oh!"
1636040,1637040," Cool!"
1637040,1638040," Oh!"
1638040,1639040," Okay."
1639040,1640040," So..."
1640040,1642040," We extracted the..."
1642040,1645040," We basically grouped the uniforms into this single field."
1645040,1649040," Which will make it easier to add more additional uniforms."
1649040,1652040," Which is kinda cool."
1652040,1654040," You know what I wanna try to do?"
1654040,1656040," When I'm switching the..."
1656040,1657040," The filter."
1657040,1658040," Right."
1658040,1659040," So we have a filter selector."
1659040,1660040," Right."
1660040,1661040," Uh..."
1661040,1664040," And in the filter selector, we have..."
1664040,1665040," Uh..."
1665040,1666040," I don't remember."
1666040,1670040," Like, where is the select filter event?"
1670040,1671040," Right."
1671040,1672040," So maybe..."
1672040,1673040," Update."
1673040,1674040," Yeah."
1674040,1675040," There we go."
1675040,1676040," Yeah."
1676040,1677040," There we go."
1677040,1678040," So when you select a new filter..."
1678040,1680040," I wanna actually print..."
1680040,1681040," Uh..."
1681040,1682040," Something like..."
1682040,1683040," Uh..."
1683040,1684040," Program..."
1684040,1685040," Program..."
1685040,1686040," Uh..."
1686040,1687040," Uniforms."
1687040,1688040," Right."
1688040,1690040," Just to see what kind of uniforms we have in there."
1690040,1691040," And I just wanna see that..."
1691040,1693040," Hard adds more uniforms in there."
1693040,1694040," Right."
1694040,1696040," Does Hard add more uniforms?"
1696040,1697040," Uh..."
1697040,1698040," Every time we select something..."
1698040,1699040," Right."
1699040,1700040," Here is the uniforms."
1700040,1701040," Uh..."
1701040,1703040," Resolution, emote, size, and time."
1703040,1707040," So some of them don't use resolution and size."
1707040,1708040," And that's fine."
1708040,1709040," Uh..."
1709040,1710040," But some of them will."
1710040,1711040," Right."
1711040,1713040," So here is the hard."
1713040,1716040," And in here we just don't have anything."
1716040,1717040," Uh..."
1717040,1718040," Okay."
1718040,1719040," That's cool."
1719040,1720040," I really like that."
1720040,1722040," I really like that we didn't add anything in there."
1722040,1724040," Even though I specified in hard."
1724040,1726040," Please add something there."
1726040,1727040," Cool."
1727040,1729040," So let's go back to hard."
1729040,1730040," Uh..."
1730040,1731040," And..."
1731040,1732040," What do we have in here?"
1732040,1733040," We have params."
1733040,1734040," Right."
1734040,1735040," And..."
1735040,1738040," I think I'm iterating through the params of the filter."
1738040,1739040," Don't I?"
1739040,1742040," So I do filter params."
1742040,1743040," So here they are."
1743040,1744040," If uh..."
1744040,1746040," Params is in uniform already."
1746040,1749040," If it's already in the uniforms we don't do anything."
1749040,1750040," So uh..."
1750040,1754040," Maybe we can just do something like consult a log param name."
1754040,1755040," Right."
1755040,1756040," And uh..."
1756040,1757040," Will it add anything in there?"
1757040,1758040," Uh..."
1758040,1759040," Let's find out."
1759040,1760040," Uh..."
1760040,1761040," So it's gonna be hard."
1761040,1762040," Um..."
1762040,1763040," Okay."
1763040,1765040," Zoom intensity and amplitude."
1765040,1767040," And they're not there."
1767040,1768040," They're just not there."
1768040,1769040," They're just not there."
1769040,1770040," They're just not there."
1770040,1772040," They're just not there."
1772040,1773040," Ah..."
1773040,1774040," Da-da-da-da."
1774040,1775040," Da-da-dee."
1775040,1776040," Da-da-dee."
1776040,1777040," Da-da-da-da."
1777040,1780040," Is this because of this thing?"
1780040,1781040," Okay."
1781040,1797040," Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..."
1797040,1798040," This is sus."
1798040,1799040," I'm adding this stuff in..."
1799040,1800040," Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh."
1800040,1802040," No, it's totally fine."
1802040,1803040," Okay."
1803040,1804040," So, console.log uniforms."
1804040,1805040," Right."
1805040,1806040," Uniforms is gonna be console.log..."
1806040,1807040," What am I missing?"
1807040,1808040," What the hell?"
1808040,1809040," Uh..."
1809040,1810040," Uh..."
1810040,1811040," Uh..."
1811040,1812040," Uh..."
1812040,1813040," Uh..."
1813040,1814040," Uh..."
1814040,1815040," Uh..."
1815040,1816040," Uh..."
1816040,1817040," Uh..."
1817040,1818040," Uh..."
1818040,1819040," Uh..."
1819040,1820040," Okay."
1820040,1821040," So, console.log uniforms."
1821040,1822040," Uh..."
1822040,1823040," Uh..."
1823040,1824040," Uniforms."
1824040,1825040," Right."
1825040,1826040," Uniforms is gonna be console.log..."
1826040,1827040," What am I missing?"
1827040,1828040," What the hell?"
1828040,1829040," Uh..."
1829040,1830040," What the hell?"
1830040,1831040," Uh..."
1831040,1832040," Uh..."
1832040,1837040," If it doesn't exist in there..."
1837040,1838040," Uh..."
1838040,1839040," Well, I mean, yeah, yeah."
1839040,1840040," So, in this case, it's fine."
1840040,1842040," If I pick the hard..."
1842040,1843040," Um..."
1843040,1845040," Here they are."
1845040,1847040," Here they are."
1847040,1848040," Here they are."
1848040,1857040," Am I going crazy?"
1857040,1858040," Am I going crazy?"
1858040,1860040," I think I am."
1860040,1861040," Console..."
1861040,1862040," Of course."
1862040,1867040," I'm printing the uniforms before I loaded the program."
1867040,1871040," Ah!"
1871040,1872040," Okay."
1872040,1873040," That's fine."
1873040,1874040," That's fine."
1874040,1875040," Everything's fine."
1875040,1876040," Okay?"
1876040,1877040," Everything's fine."
1877040,1879040," Oh my god."
1879040,1880040," Alright."
1880040,1881040," So..."
1881040,1882040," Yes."
1882040,1883040," We have that."
1883040,1884040," And we have that."
1884040,1886040," If I do something like this."
1886040,1887040," In the hope."
1887040,1889040," Here is the step."
1889040,1891040," And in the hard."
1891040,1892040," Uh..."
1892040,1894040," We have additional uniforms in here."
1894040,1895040," So, but we only use time uniforms."
1895040,1897040," So, there's nothing much to..."
1897040,1898040," To say in here."
1898040,1899040," Okay."
1899040,1900040," Fine."
1900040,1901040," Cool."
1901040,1902040," Um..."
1902040,1903040," So, the next thing I want to do."
1903040,1906040," When we're loading the filter program."
1906040,1916040," I also want to be able to construct like a UI elements for each individual parameter in there."
1916040,1917040," Right?"
1917040,1922040," So, maybe it's going to be something like, you know, params panel."
1922040,1923040," Yeah."
1923040,1924040," This is what it's going to be."
1924040,1925040," So, it's going to be params panel."
1925040,1927040," And this thing is going to be just a diff."
1927040,1928040," Right?"
1928040,1929040," Uh..."
1929040,1933040," And it's going to be a diff into which we're going to be appending the like more and more"
1933040,1934040," elements."
1934040,1935040," Um..."
1935040,1936040," Okay."
1936040,1940040," So, in here I probably want to do something like a switch case."
1940040,1943040," So, I'm going to switch upon the uniforms."
1943040,1945040," Actually, filter."
1945040,1946040," Params."
1946040,1947040," Param name."
1947040,1948040," Right?"
1948040,1949040," Param name."
1949040,1952040," And I'm going to be looking at the type of this entire thing."
1952040,1954040," And if the type is float."
1954040,1955040," Right?"
1955040,1956040," If the type is float."
1956040,1961040," We're going to be constructing a new element to update floats."
1961040,1963040," Something like, I don't know, range and whatnot."
1963040,1967040," And we're going to be appending it into the parameter panel."
1967040,1968040," Something like this."
1968040,1969040," It's going to be params panel."
1969040,1970040," Uh..."
1970040,1972040," And it's going to be just append child."
1972040,1973040," Uh..."
1973040,1974040," Append child."
1974040,1976040," And we're appending another diff."
1976040,1977040," Yet another diff."
1977040,1982040," And within that diff, we're going to have something probably like span."
1982040,1983040," Uh..."
1983040,1984040," With the text."
1984040,1987040," With the text of the parameter name."
1987040,1989040," So, it's going to be param name."
1989040,1990040," There we go."
1990040,1991040," Uh..."
1991040,1993040," And then, we're probably going to have some sort of input."
1993040,1994040," Right?"
1994040,1997040," So, maybe I also want to grab this entire thing like that."
1997040,1998040," Right?"
1998040,2001040," There's like a space and a colon in there."
2001040,2002040," Right?"
2002040,2004040," And then, we're going to have an input."
2004040,2005040," Right?"
2005040,2008040," I think our framework has inputs."
2008040,2009040," Yeah."
2009040,2010040," You can provide the input."
2010040,2013040," And the input is going to be of the type for range."
2013040,2014040," Right?"
2014040,2015040," So, how do you do with..."
2015040,2017040," How do you work with ranges?"
2017040,2018040," Uh..."
2018040,2019040," Input slider."
2019040,2020040," Uh..."
2020040,2021040," Range sliders."
2021040,2022040," Um..."
2022040,2023040," Mm-hmm."
2023040,2024040," Mm-hmm."
2024040,2025040," So, you can set min and max."
2025040,2027040," And you can set a value."
2027040,2028040," Uh..."
2028040,2029040," You also have to specify the class..."
2029040,2030040," Oh..."
2030040,2031040," Classes just like for CSS stuff."
2031040,2032040," Uh..."
2032040,2033040," And..."
2033040,2034040," Uh..."
2034040,2035040," You can also specify ID."
2035040,2036040," But we don't need ID."
2036040,2037040," Uh..."
2037040,2038040," All right."
2038040,2040040," So, it's going to be type range."
2040040,2044040," And we're going to set its attribute to be..."
2044040,2045040," Uh..."
2045040,2046040," Of the filter."
2046040,2047040," Params."
2047040,2048040," Param name."
2048040,2049040," Uh..."
2049040,2050040," Default."
2050040,2051040," Right."
2051040,2052040," Uh..."
2052040,2053040," Default is already taken."
2053040,2054040," Ah..."
2054040,2055040," Shit."
2055040,2056040," Let's actually rename it to init."
2056040,2059040," What does default keyword mean in JavaScript?"
2059040,2060040," Default keyword."
2060040,2062040," What does it even mean in there?"
2062040,2064040," The reasons behind the default keyword."
2064040,2065040," It's ES6."
2065040,2066040," So, what's that?"
2066040,2069040," Because you can export many variables from the..."
2069040,2070040," Ah..."
2070040,2071040," Okay."
2071040,2072040," So, let's see."
2072040,2073040," I forgot about it."
2073040,2077040," So, let's actually rename default to init."
2077040,2078040," Right."
2078040,2080040," So, it's going to be initial value."
2080040,2081040," Uh-huh."
2081040,2082040," Load filter."
2082040,2083040," There we go."
2083040,2084040," And..."
2084040,2086040," This is going to be just init."
2086040,2087040," Okay."
2087040,2088040," So..."
2088040,2090040," What's going to be min and max range?"
2090040,2091040," That's a good question."
2091040,2092040," That's a good question."
2092040,2093040," That's a good question."
2093040,2094040," Um..."
2098040,2101040," I can probably specify min and max."
2101040,2102040," Uh..."
2102040,2107040," But that means I'll have to go to these filters."
2107040,2108040," And..."
2108040,2110040," Something like min."
2110040,2111040," Uh..."
2111040,2113040," And zoom, I suppose..."
2113040,2114040," Um..."
2114040,2115040," I guess zoom..."
2115040,2116040," Can you not specify..."
2116040,2118040," Let's not specify them for now."
2118040,2121040," I don't really want to think about it too much right now."
2121040,2123040," It could be specified later."
2123040,2125040," Uh..."
2125040,2126040," So..."
2126040,2127040," I'm..."
2127040,2128040," Assigning a value."
2128040,2129040," And..."
2129040,2131040," That is pretty much it."
2131040,2132040," So..."
2132040,2133040," If..."
2133040,2135040," We encounter any other type."
2135040,2137040," We should throw an error."
2137040,2138040," Saying that..."
2138040,2139040," Uh..."
2139040,2141040," Well, we don't know this kind of type."
2141040,2147600," um filter parameters"
2147600,2163760," parameters do not support type um they do not support this type essentially"
2167520,2173360," so interestingly enough um maybe we should specify the name of the filter but to be fair we don't"
2173360,2178080," know the name of the filter because filter itself does not store its own name but this is something"
2178080,2186480," that could be fixed later okay so here is the params panel and uh we're gonna actually store it"
2187120,2197360," in here so params panel um params panel and let's just assign it in here program around this panel"
2197360,2207680," there we go here's the params panel and now every time you select a new filter you select a new filter"
2207680,2214800," we have to substitute that params panel in there i wonder how we can even do that that's actually"
2214800,2220080," very interesting also another interesting thing if you don't have params in here we should ignore"
2220080,2225200," them completely but maybe it's going to happen automatically uh right if you try to iterate"
2225200,2229360," undefined in here it's just gonna sadly not work because i don't remember seeing any errors"
2229360,2239200," in there all right so uh let me take a look all right so yeah seems fine seems fine i don't see any"
2239200,2247680," errors so okay this one is interesting uh fail to execute set attribute on element is not a valid value"
2247680,2255600," so i probably fucked up something big time is that because really you cannot set the value to"
2257360,2268560," uh to an element http input element so sliders do not support uh sliders do not support floating"
2268560,2280640," points okay that's very interesting um so html5 range slider floating points is it even possible to have"
2280640,2299040," something like that uh range slider uh the value is set to something which can't be converted into a valid"
2299040,2304160," floating point number uh validation fails because the input is suffering from the bad okay"
2305040,2314080," uh all right makes sense to me uh there's also step it it can be floating point but why it wasn't a floating"
2314080,2317040," point um"
2322080,2327200," is not a valid attribute name ah attribute name it's not a okay i see"
2327200,2335920," load filter program load filter program yeah"
2335920,2338320," okay"
2338320,2347920," all right so what do we have in here and if i do something like hard uh it seems to be working okay"
2347920,2357280," console log let's remove this logging we don't need it anymore um now load uh filter program"
2357280,2368800," there we go this is where we load all that and here is an interesting thing so as we load the program"
2368800,2374000," right as we load the program we need to take the programs uh"
2375520,2382560," programs panel right we need to take its programs panel and we need to embed it um somewhere down"
2382560,2391920," below i would say right so okay we have a root uh and in the root we have um filter and filter list"
2391920,2396880," right so here's the filter list this is where it is created right maybe it would make sense to actually"
2396880,2402720," put it like that and the attribute is going to put it down below then we have a filter preview right so here"
2402720,2409920," is the preview uh and maybe another thing we want to have in here is something like deep uh programs"
2409920,2416720," right and if i refresh this into i think now we have programs in here but they are not particularly centered"
2416720,2424720," well this is because we don't have a class set to them equal to uh widget element right widget element"
2425280,2431600," because it's done in css there we go um so we have filter and here you're going to have parameters of"
2431600,2442080," that filter um and we're going to embed parameters of that filter um i guess into the root i guess that's"
2442080,2447440," going to be the easiest way to do that so we're just going to be appending that stuff in there so you"
2447440,2457440," create the program then you take the root and you append child program um program program program uh"
2457440,2464800," params panel right so it's going to be params panel there we go uh so and next time if you're"
2464800,2472880," loading something right um is it possible to remove a child uh from a particular node uh javascript"
2473680,2480320," remove child uh yeah there's literally remove child perfect that's precisely what i wanted to have in"
2480320,2488320," here so that means before uh loading the program we're going to be doing a root remove child program"
2488880,2498240," uh programs panel right there we go then um we're loading a new program we're loading a completely new"
2498240,2505360," program and we're appending uh a parent child a completely new panel in here in there so it's going"
2505360,2513520," to be params panel there we go uh and let's take a look if it works or not okay so none of these filters"
2513520,2519440," have any parameters any custom parameters but hard does have parameters and here they are"
2519440,2529280," yes so essentially if your filter if your filter defines additional parameters uh they're going to"
2529280,2533680," be displayed here automatically and you will be able to control them and different filters"
2533680,2538400," are going to have different parameters defined for them this is precisely what i'm trying to implement"
2538400,2542400," in here and they're automatically generated so for example you can put something like your mom"
2542960,2548800," right and uh by default we only have type float right so you can only have type float and"
2548800,2555920," so and your mom is going to be initially something like uh over 9 000 right so that's going to be the"
2555920,2564000," value of your mom uh and if i go to harden here there we go here's your mom uh the biggest value in"
2564000,2576240," the parameter list but we also have to probably um i don't know we can always put params panel right"
2576240,2585840," it's going to be attribute set class to uh widget element it's going to widget element all right so and"
2585840,2592720," if i take a look at the heart in here uh i cannot see it i'm blind yes i'm blind okay so there we go"
2592720,2599040," so essentially depending on what you selected here uh we're going to have like different parameters and"
2599040,2604160," some of them don't have any parameters in here yet but as we have this mechanism we're going to be adding"
2604160,2609360," those parameters anyway all right that's actually pretty cool i'm super excited"
2609360,2618880," so and then at any point right uh you can remove the parameter in here"
2618880,2628960," right and there we go we don't have those things anymore cool this is nice i love that i really really"
2628960,2634000," like that uh i wonder if there's like a way to display the actual value in here i think there"
2634000,2639520," should be a way to display your value um how are we going to be doing that we can try to wire it up"
2639520,2647520," um filter program blah blah blah so here is the span"
2654800,2662720," so what's the best way to where is the best way to put the value so uh try it yourself"
2662720,2675200," custom range slider maybe we can put that after uh this entire thing if you know what i mean so it"
2675200,2682160," could be something like span uh and that span is going to have like some sort of initial value"
2682880,2688320," uh i don't know filter programs around name"
2688320,2698720," all right and this is going to be the value uh right and if i go to here uh it's broken because"
2698720,2706960," the thing is not a string right uh yeah it has to be either not or a string uh how can i convert a"
2706960,2717040," thing to a string javascript uh to string yeah there is such thing as to string beautiful uh to string"
2717040,2726000," and if i go hard everything seems to be okay okay here are the values so we can just keep the values"
2726000,2734160," somewhere here uh but we also need to update them every time the the slider updates right so we need to"
2734160,2745280," update them every time the slider updates uh okay so let's create something like value preview so here's"
2745280,2752240," the value preview and let's move it somewhere there value preview uh and let's put it like that there we go"
2752240,2762320," so now we have input range and for the input range we probably also need to set up the event um event listeners"
2762320,2775440," of some sort um i suppose it could be something like changed on so http um html input slider on change"
2775440,2784400," can i just do on change for this thing um is not triggering in firefox something something uh apparently"
2784400,2791760," in our wrong on change should only be triggered when the user releases the mouse uh you should use an"
2791760,2798400," input which will capture live updates in firefox safari okay okay let's actually use an input then so um"
2798400,2809120," so value preview the value input let's call this thing a value input uh and we're gonna put it like this here"
2809120,2819600," there we go so value input all right so when the value input is going to be on input uh and"
2819600,2830560," so let's actually do it like this i'm gonna just simply print this entire thing console log e"
2830560,2834400," and we'll see what we have in there and how we're gonna be updating this entire stuff"
2834400,2842880," uh oh boy oh boy where is my site so heart"
2842880,2852240," we're going hard okay so here are live updates and i suppose we have"
2854560,2856960," uh where do we have a value so there's a target"
2856960,2866560," i guess one of the things we can do in here is essentially uh if we're going to be using like"
2866560,2873120," function so this is going to be set to the element itself right and maybe because of that we'll be able"
2873120,2882320," to do something like um how to set inner html inner text uh javascript set inner text or something how"
2882320,2889280," to set the inner text inner text there is such thing okay inner uh text is going to be set to value"
2889280,2898400," maybe to this uh value there we go so is this even possible in here yeah this is not how we do that"
2898400,2909200," uh okay so let's go hard and okay nothing is happening at all i'm super happy this is so cool"
2911120,2916080," i wonder why it doesn't even fail that's what's interesting about it so it doesn't even fail"
2916080,2927520," even though we capture the the things but it's just uh it's not this ah value preview oh my god i see"
2927520,2937440," all righty okay is it gonna work now is it gonna work now yo uh okay yes look at that look at that"
2938320,2944640," so this intensity there's amplitude and we're capable of updating all of these things live oh my god"
2944640,2957360," oh my god that is so cool that is so goddamn good mate nice nice nice nice so we also need need a way to"
2957360,2970160," capture those things to do so maybe we're gonna add some sort of a method to the panel right some"
2970160,2981200," sort of a method to the panel um we also need to be able to sort of react to the updates of the params panel"
2981840,2985200," if you know what i mean um so"
2985200,2999440," i think we're gonna just throw uh an event we're gonna throw an event uh saying that uniforms have"
2999440,3008800," updated and we're gonna gather the values of each and you well to be fair we can basically only provide the"
3008800,3018800," name of the uniform that has has updated and um its value so then you can actually update only the"
3018800,3026000," uniforms that you care about sounds like a plan actually sounds like a plan um i really like that"
3028240,3034640," so essentially let me find the way we dispatch events so dispatch event it's gonna be a custom event and"
3034640,3040480," in here right every time we update something uh we're gonna be dispatching event but we're gonna"
3040480,3045280," be dispatching the event uh via the params panel right so it's gonna be a params panel"
3045840,3058800," um so here's the params panel um uniform uniform uh changed right uniform changed and the detail is going to be uh name"
3058800,3065200," uh the name is going to be something like param name and then the value is going to be uh"
3065200,3069840," uh the this value i suppose yeah there we go so that's how it's going to be done"
3070080,3078800," there we go so that's how it's going to be done so and then uh when you take params panel uh you're"
3078800,3086160," essentially going to subscribe to this update right you're going to subscribe to this update"
3087360,3098480," and that's pretty much it that is pretty much it okay i think i want to make a small break uh and"
3098480,3107040," make a cup of tea uh so and after the break we're going to wire up the updates from the panel into the"
3107040,3114800," uniforms so you'll be able to actually use these parameters in the shader and customize these like"
3114800,3122080," parameters live that will be so goddamn cool actually yeah imagine you select the filter you adjust some"
3122080,3131120," of the parameters in here and it just works that will be so sick my god uh anyway let's make a small break"
3131120,3141040," here's the funny bug uh i'm not sure if you can see that but uh the heart filter uh after some time"
3141040,3147520," it starts to go absolutely crazy um yeah instead of like giving like a circular motion it's just like"
3147520,3152720," start shaking violently uh and i don't know what causes that i actually reported that uh"
3152720,3160240," but i still don't know what is going on probably maybe we're using like a global timer that goes from"
3160240,3168400," zero to like infinity and maybe at some point it just goes over like a safe value of integer um so"
3168400,3177040," basically in javascript there's a notion of unsafe in values of integers uh script unsafe in number or"
3177040,3186080," something uh safe integers uh oh safe integer well we're not using integers though we're using floats for"
3186080,3195120," representing uh values but anyway so the thing is after a certain value um it cannot be easily represented with"
3195120,3202400," ieee 754 because javascript uses um you know floating points for everything and because of that it's unsafe"
3202400,3208560," so some of the math laws start to get broken or something like that maybe it's somehow related to that"
3208560,3213760," but again i'm not a web developer i don't know any of the any of the shit so whatever uh i have an issues"
3213760,3222160," for that uh i'm gonna solve it as i get to it um hard yeah so if you leave hard filter for too long the timing"
3222160,3227520," starts to act strangely right and here is basically what's going on let's just leave it for for a while"
3227520,3229520," and it just goes like that um"
3229520,3239520," one of the things uh probably would be instead of like having a global timer that goes from zero to"
3239520,3248400," infinity basically let it loop around duration from zero up until duration and then back to zero in duration because that's where it's supposed to loop"
3249040,3260400," right um makes sense i suppose anyways uh so here we are dispatching things that have changed in the panel"
3260400,3269760," uh in the params panel let's try to wire them up into uh the into the filter preview right so let's see what's gonna happen"
3270560,3279360," uh so yeah this is basically how we do all of that uh we're appending child but on top of that i think i want to go"
3279360,3286320," through all the uniforms and set their default values if that makes any sense um"
3286320,3298000," that makes any sense i guess it does so i'm gonna be iterating through uh program name in um"
3299200,3301520," this filter is i'm gonna sneeze by the way just seconds"
3301520,3314080," all right thank you so much so here's the selected filter um and then we are compiling that selected"
3314080,3324400," filter um and that's pretty much it but it does not allow us to does not allow us to know what are the parameters"
3324400,3329120," um which is um so um which is kind of sad so i still need to be able to separate the"
3329120,3335840," built-in uniforms and param uniforms i still need to be able to separate them"
3335840,3340080," uh because once as once this thing compiled um"
3340080,3344080," once this thing compiled i probably want to iterate only through"
3344080,3351520," the uh user parameters and set their initial default values that's what i probably want to do"
3352400,3369760," another thing here would be probably give params panel a special method that would um"
3369760,3378400," give you the snapshot of all of the parameters i guess that's a that's a good solution right so in the"
3378400,3384640," the params panel you just call this thing and uh this is a snapshot of parameters you have"
3384640,3390960," the uh uniform of that parameter and you have the value of that parameter and that will be actually"
3390960,3396960," kind of cool because we're not removing params panels per se even though we probably should"
3396960,3403120," but i mean we're just removing them from the from the system so uh hopefully garbage collector will"
3403120,3413920," collect them at some point we'll see we'll see um so uh they are recreated every time so they are"
3413920,3419200," recreated all the time but maybe this is something that we shouldn't do maybe we should actually pre-compile"
3419200,3425440," all of the program all the filters and when you switch the filter we just switch the program and switch"
3425440,3430400," panels and stuff okay so this is actually a pretty good idea but it will take too much time uh for the"
3430400,3439760," stream so but i'm gonna create like a separate issue for that uh pre-load all all the filters right pre-load"
3439760,3445440," all the filters it could be also done lazily to be fair right it doesn't necessarily has to be pre-loading"
3445440,3454080," uh we could just um load them as you try to access them but we don't unload them if you switch to a different"
3454080,3461280," one so that way we could quite easily just you know switch the program and switch the panel and because"
3461280,3468560," of that the panel will uh preserve its state and uh that's going to be pretty convenient right so yeah"
3468560,3479440," that's a that's a good idea i like that pre-load all of the filters and switch between and just switch"
3479440,3489920," between um them without uh loading and loading them constantly right so this is going to be a to-do"
3489920,3499440," that we want to put in here um so how where are we going to put a parameter in there where are we going to"
3499440,3506720," put the parameter um so if i want if i'm going to have a parameter i want to uh have an access to the"
3506720,3514240," value inputs in here right i want to have an access to the value inputs oh boy um"
3514240,3520480," so let's actually put it like this so it's going to be something like"
3522080,3533920," um params inputs and it's going to be this thing right as we create a new value input right we're"
3533920,3543520," going to be doing programs inputs uh param name equal value input uh there we go that way after we"
3543520,3549360," initialized everything we'll still have an access to the param params input right we still have an access to"
3549360,3556480," the params input and we can quite easily just query all this jazz all right so after that uh"
3556480,3565600," params panel is going to have something like uh params snapshot right so it's going to be a special"
3565600,3574800," function right that will return you the params snapshot snapshot is going to be the object right and what"
3574800,3581040," what we're going to be doing in here we're going to be iterating for uh param name in params inputs"
3581040,3591680," uh right in the snapshot snapshot is going to be param name equal programs inputs um param name"
3593760,3608560," and this thing has a value right so value input value input yes so it's going to be a value there we go"
3608560,3614720," like this and then we just return the snapshot i'm pretty sure it could be done uh in a more"
3615520,3623760," functionally uh mapping values and what not i wonder how to do that javascript uh object map values is"
3623760,3626560," that a thing you can do object entries all right"
3629760,3636240," so we can get an entries and um okay whatever"
3636240,3647680," so here is the programs snapshot and every time something changes you get the parameter you get the"
3647680,3658400," value um and some other stuff and i'm thinking maybe it makes sense to always get the full snapshot just in"
3658400,3663040," case um but maybe not"
3663040,3674160," so we can probably do it like this uniform changed and uh then you could get the programs snapshot and just"
3674160,3677920," iterate over them and reset all of them i think i think it's going to be easier to work with"
3678560,3685360," right uh in any situation you just take the parameter snapshot and you just get it um though"
3685360,3694160," it would be better to actually split them uh slightly right so this one is going to be simply"
3694160,3700960," a value right this one is going to be simply a value and uh you also want to have a uniform right"
3701280,3715440," so and uniform how do we get the uniform oh boy um so we have a param name and we already have uniforms"
3717440,3727040," uh so uniforms are in here so that means yeah okay um uniforms"
3727040,3736720," um forms for um name and that's it so because of that it will probably make sense to actually put that"
3736720,3744960," method after right because this is where it's all all of that is going to be available right um"
3744960,3754640," also another interesting thing so this is the params input right this is the params input and this"
3754640,3762560," is the value input and what are the places we're using them um it would be better to refer to this entire"
3762560,3770080," thing like that but param name is too long uh i'm gonna do it as it is right now doesn't really matter"
3770080,3781520," so here's a snapshot and everything is good so far at least um everything is good so far"
3781520,3786880," so let me actually uh try to restart this entire thing and see if i didn't break anything anything"
3786880,3795760," significant and uh let's go hard and no i didn't break anything so far that's cool that is very very cool"
3795760,3805920," uh so uh filter selector there we go we have a filter selector uh panels uh programs panel right so we"
3805920,3814960," append the child um and one of the things we probably want to do is program params uh programs panel and we're"
3814960,3826880," we're gonna add event listener to uh program something updated right um program around changed i already"
3826880,3835680," forgot i already forgot what it was called uh uniform changed ah okay let's actually call it something like"
3835680,3845520," params changed params changed because it's not about the uniform changed yeah um rams panel add event"
3845520,3854960," changed and when something has changed all right what we're going to be doing in here"
3860800,3866320," we're going to be updating the uniforms essentially right so we're going to be updating the uniforms"
3866320,3874000," so we need to go through the snapshot let's actually capture the snapshot uh so it's going to be this"
3874000,3885920," params snapshot right there we go uh and then for uh program name in snapshot right and what we're doing is"
3885920,3899200," gl uniform one app um so and the program name snapshot for ram name snapshot program name uniform uniform"
3899200,3906320," uh will be equal to this thing but value there we go so this is how we're going to be updating all that"
3907200,3911920," uh interestingly enough uh interestingly enough is that we also need to"
3911920,3925680," call it after we set everything up as well so is it possible so this is this um and"
3929440,3936480," so let's create a function like this uh and instead of this one is going to be basically params uh"
3936480,3947360," program programs panel program programs panel and the function should be called something like um update"
3947360,3957600," um update for ram programs i guess but maybe sync for us okay so it's actually called sync params"
3957600,3962320," all right we take that and there we go so and the event listeners is going to be basically sync"
3962320,3967440," programs right if this thing is updated you just do that um all right that's cool"
3967440,3974720," um so we have that it takes the program uh it takes the current programs panel uh takes"
3974720,3982000," the snapshot iterates over all of that and yeah every everyone is happy um so then we add it to the uh"
3982000,3989600," event listener uh and so on and so forth so what i'm thinking is that when it is time to remove the"
3989600,3994400," program right so we delete the program we remove the panel from that thing we also need to remove the"
3994400,4003360," event listener okay javascript uh remove uh remove event listener uh it's literally called removing"
4003360,4010080," event event listener do you have to provide anything else except the name uh and you provide the listener"
4010080,4018800," function okay so i do have the function so we remove the child and program programs panel uh remove event"
4018800,4028960," listener and the event listener is basically sync uh sync programs there we go and then we have to attach this entire thing uh"
4030240,4036880," to a new one we need to attach it to a new one so we already kind of established very interesting"
4036880,4043920," convention so we have a process of uh loading the program and attaching the program to the filter"
4043920,4049680," listener and then when we're loading we're detaching it so uh we need to formalize this kind of this kind"
4049680,4057600," of thing i think okay so we append the channel and we're also here doing this thing all right so"
4059120,4068480," and i would say uh you mode the filter so this could be something like this let's let me actually"
4068480,4079200," set it to undefined uh program like this so in this chunk of code already repeats this one essentially"
4079200,4088480," so this one's a program and to be fair this one could be under under this thing there we go"
4089120,4096800," uh so this is detaching the program this is attaching the program makes sense to me"
4096800,4100160," yeah makes sense to me"
4100160,4109920," so this definitely could be formalized at some point uh and also it should be only done if the program is"
4109920,4118720," you know available you know available it's quite important okay cool um so that should be it"
4118720,4129760," and every time something is updated we are updating the uniforms all right i'm super happy about all of"
4129760,4135840," that let's see what's gonna happen uh did it break i don't think it broke let's switch to hard and something"
4135840,4145600," already broke listener okay list nerd uh listener all right one more time uh hard and it seems to be"
4145600,4157760," working now let's try to update and okay uniform is notified nice uh uh 970 uh uniform really"
4159760,4167680," uniform sit yet again making the same mistakes over and over again uh can i blame javascript for that"
4167680,4177680," i guess okay nothing nothing is changing nothing is changing and you know why because in a shader"
4177680,4185440," we do not accept these uniforms yes we wired everything up but in a shader we do not accept anything okay"
4185440,4192880," so let's quickly do that uh let's find the hard filter right so here's the hard filter and so here"
4192880,4201520," what we have to do we have to get rid of this right and we have to enable this there we go so now these"
4201520,4208800," parameters became the uniforms and the values of the uniforms are passed through the ui uh all right"
4208800,4214800," all right all right all right and what do we have in here uh hopefully it will work now and it doesn't"
4214800,4226160," and it doesn't even display anything okay oh it is working oh it is working holy this is so cool i like"
4226160,4235200," that okay and amplitude amplitude went over the roof oh yeah okay so we definitely need to set up the"
4235200,4242320," ranges allowed ranges because these ranges are kind of big i think i think it's too much this is cool i can"
4242320,4250080," control that finally finally finally i can control that this is so cool oh my god i love it i love it"
4250080,4258080," okay so uh we need to set up the ranges and also we need to fix the problem of the first initialization"
4258080,4266640," of the uniforms because once you switch uh to hard by default nothing is set properly so i suppose you have"
4266640,4277280," to yeah like why why is it not said didn't i didn't i call sync params well yeah i didn't okay so basically"
4277280,4287280," uh as we established everything uh we need to call sync params at least once okay that makes sense"
4288000,4294800," uh all right just to sync the parameters all right that makes sense and if i switch to hard it didn't do"
4294800,4303920," shit thank you so much why didn't do shit is it because of the uh of the cache no it is not because of"
4303920,4314480," that i wonder why i wonder why but it does sync the parameters right you know what i'm talking about it does"
4314480,4321200," sync the parameters so you load the filter do this"
4321200,4333680," so maybe we need to do it like that i mean it's not going to change anything but i think i think it"
4333680,4347680," makes sense to do it like this oh wait well we have to do it like this all right all right all right"
4347680,4356080," oh it could be true actually"
4360560,4364960," it is true look if i swap them like that"
4364960,4368880," it still works the fuck"
4368880,4379760," ah okay okay that makes sense i think i have to do that in here so if i swap it like this"
4383280,4392240," still works still works no why okay god damn javascript anyway so we can have this i'm super"
4392240,4398080," happy about it i'm in fact super happy about it and here i can control things i can"
4398080,4404320," zoom in zoom out and the question is um how can we set up the ranges i suppose"
4404880,4409840," i suppose we can provide the ranges in the um"
4409840,4417920," in the filter itself right so let's actually go in there uh before i do that i think it's actually"
4417920,4429840," worth doing the commit uh so let me go to index index js uh hard there we go uh and in here i'm"
4429840,4434400," going to be removing this stuff so this is now a bunch of uniforms and stuff like that"
4434400,4442720," and essentially what i want to do in here so the zoom is going to be like mean value is going to be"
4442720,4449040," one and the max value maybe the max value is not going to be set up right like whatever you use whatever"
4449040,4459520," value you want um but you're not going to be able to go like below this thing um so intensity um"
4459520,4464480," i don't really know what is intensity in this particular case let me take a look um"
4464480,4475520," so intensity is multiplied by time all right um so maybe we can set it to something like"
4476800,4481840," so and the amplitude is something very small um"
4481840,4493360," let's put mean to i suppose zero and i don't know max could be could be 100"
4493360,4498000," so it could be 100. we could probably also set up this step"
4498000,4506400," yeah it makes sense i think uh step here is actually quite important uh because you want to have a fine"
4506400,4515280," control over the um over the zoom but intensity i think step one is totally fine right so it's gonna"
4515280,4523600," be step like one uh so i'm not sure about amplitude but that's the things we need to have in here uh load"
4523600,4532080," filter program uh to do so here are the parameters okay so here is the value input and we can set some"
4532080,4540480," parameters in here so it's going to be attribute and it's going to be filter programs uh program name"
4540480,4548160," program name and this is going to be just mean all right so then we're going to have max and um and step"
4548160,4552880," max and step there we go cool"
4555680,4565200," and value is basically in the unit uh maybe for the consistency we need to rename init to value so"
4565200,4572560," you know what i'm talking about uh yeah i didn't want to do that but"
4574880,4578000," okay i'm going to find another meeting here"
4578000,4584800," shit"
4584800,4586960," yeah"
4586960,4593040," definition there we go so this is a value now"
4593040,4599440," so maybe at some point we're gonna well i mean it depends there can be different kinds"
4600640,4602160," but now we can control these things"
4602160,4608080," we can control these things uh hard"
4608080,4621360," all right let me see uh what we've got what we've got so here is the hard and it's at 1.4 uh and"
4621360,4627920," the step is going crazy by the way so intensity is zero"
4630160,4632880," i don't know why excuse me um"
4632880,4640240," i don't really know why so max should be defaulting here 100"
4640240,4644480," but it's kind of strange"
4644480,4659120," well i mean why step is not working step should work uh all right html5 input slider um input slider step"
4660160,4663440," uh what are the possible things in there"
4663440,4674320," so yeah i mean max and step and shut like that yeah that's what i'm talking about so size 10 uh"
4674320,4684320," uh mean step that's precisely what the fuck i'm talking about come on come on come on man um but if they"
4684320,4688720," say undefined and if i said undefined in one of the thing nothing should happen"
4688720,4695680," is it cache problem yet again or something i don't know man come on uh all right"
4698880,4710480," it just doesn't want to do that um load filter program load filter program here is the step and"
4714480,4731200," i'm missing something very obvious uh console lock filter programs let's start debugging this"
4731200,4747600," all right so what do we got in here uh hard uh that was strange intensity"
4748400,4758880," yeah yeah uh zoom oh"
4758880,4763120," programs"
4773680,4778400," so maybe i could take a look at one of these things okay i didn't think about looking into them"
4778400,4787440," actually uh range value mean max is that because of that really because of that"
4787440,4798720," i can try to slightly change it of course um so let's do the following thing"
4800160,4811280," if uh this thing defined right uh i can just do it like that it's gonna be um um value input"
4811280,4821600," value input yeah i can just do it like that sure uh if this thing"
4826640,4840080," uh this thing you defined i'm gonna set this um value input"
4840080,4846480," if this thing"
4855040,4858160," all right all right are you gonna work now please um"
4858160,4862800," nope"
4862800,4870400," well it could be because"
4870400,4878880," uh i guess 69 is a reasonable is a reasonable upper limit"
4881120,4882880," let's let's set it to to that"
4882880,4887840," so this one is going to be something like max"
4887840,4893440," uh six and nine and step should be all right"
4893440,4903760," all right now it makes sense so the reason why it was so intense is because the upper limit was so"
4903760,4907840," huge okay that makes sense to me finally uh and this"
4910560,4911280," uh-huh"
4911280,4915600," uh-huh and that becomes like very very much"
4915600,4917120," to be fair"
4917120,4920880," it's already kind of crazy around"
4920880,4925760," 42 so maybe 42 is going to be the maximum in here"
4925760,4930960," so intensity max 42 right and"
4934240,4941360," so this is the maximum so this is the maximum and then this is the minimum minimum is zero"
4941360,4945040," i guess and i don't understand why zoom"
4945040,4952240," of one was not set properly and amplitude"
4952240,4954000," huh"
4959120,4965120," yeah amplitude should be actually super small so the amplitude uh value this one could be actually"
4965120,4975040," maximum i think maybe not um so let's set minimum to zero right this is minimum to zero uh maximum to"
4975040,4984640," one over eight right one over eight uh and the step step is going to be around maybe zero"
4985840,4993760," one yeah because for the amplitude it does make sense uh all right all right all right so this is going to"
4993760,5004720," be hard and we can yeah so back to like literally zero maybe for for that one it could the step could be like"
5004720,5009280," thousands i don't know i'm not sure if it's a good idea generally but"
5009280,5017600," okay i don't like that the the ui jumping around but this is this could be fixed at some point"
5018800,5023280," and the zoom is completely fucked up the zoom is completely fucked up"
5023280,5025840," yeah"
5025840,5035200," um so the max could be actually four let's make four and see if it's gonna it's gonna be nice"
5045280,5049840," about two"
5049840,5054320," yeah i guess it's fine"
5054320,5059920," then you can adjust it to 125"
5059920,5067120," 125 then intensity you can lower it down"
5069920,5072720," and zoom you can control the zoom as much as you want"
5072720,5081920," i'm not quite understanding why the the default parameters don't really work properly"
5081920,5087120," so the default value for the zoom is supposed to be 1.4 but when i switch to"
5087120,5095520," this thing it is not correct so it is 1.4 but by default it's just not"
5096480,5102480," and i wonder what the hell is going on in here so uh load filter program load filter program"
5102480,5111840," uh we're setting the parameters in here we don't care about that uh filter selector filter selector"
5111840,5119840," and we're syncing parameters in here we're syncing them in there uh what i'm thinking is that um we can"
5119840,5124640," try to print the snapshot just in case just to see what the hell is going on in there"
5124640,5132800," right uh just because that's kind of weird i'm gonna like snapshot there we go all right so"
5132800,5141440," here we have everything synchronized and i switch to hard and let's take a look at it's uh zoom zoom"
5141440,5154000," is set to one why the hell it is set to one well that is really weird all right um let me see load filter"
5154000,5154320," program"
5154320,5161440," so here is the value uh and we're setting that value"
5163440,5171360," uh it's the value of this thing but the value of the zoom is 1.4"
5171360,5177920," it is in fact 1.4 but it is failing to get that value"
5180880,5188560," hmm so zoom is all right intensity is all right amplitude is all right but specifically zoom is"
5188560,5193760," fucked uh specifically zoom is fucked"
5193760,5202560," i wonder why so if i take a look at this thing um so is that"
5210560,5216160," sync parents sync parents sync parents so we're syncing the parents"
5216160,5220720," i'm syncing them here again"
5220720,5224000," all right let's make a small break"
5224000,5237600," all right so doesn't work um why i have no idea so the problem here is that when we are initializing hard"
5238240,5245680," for the first time right right it's actual zooming here it's actual zoom"
5245680,5253680," is equal to one and but in reality this is equal to 1.4 and i have no idea why it doesn't work so we have"
5253680,5260160," to sort of like increase it but interestingly enough let me let me try to do that it felt"
5261040,5270080," really weird so it's going to be hard it is set to zero but this thing set is 1.4"
5270080,5280240," so the actual slider is set to zero to to one to its minimum value but this thing is sent to 1.4"
5280880,5288720," this is so weird like what the hell excuse me uh load filter program okay so what is going on in here"
5288720,5295040," uh as we iterating through each of the parameters all right we check the parameters are uniforms blah blah"
5295040,5300080," blah we take a look at the types right we're constructing ah"
5303280,5314480," i'm well this is a preview so i take the value and i assign it to to the preview all right that makes"
5314480,5325760," sense and then i take the value input and i set the value to this thing only if the value is provided but"
5325760,5332960," if it's not provided it's probably going to be set to the original value so it feels like it's just not"
5332960,5343760," it doesn't have a value right so can we take a look at the console log uh something like"
5343760,5352800," param name right param name equal to the value in here right uh actually we should probably do some"
5352800,5360240," values right so it's gonna be something like value um so what is going on here it is really really weird"
5360240,5369040," um all right so i'm switching to uh the hard and"
5369040,5380560," well interestingly enough zoom does have a value it does have a value so if i put it"
5381200,5389600," in here right if i put it in here it should uh actually trigger all right so zoom does in fact"
5389600,5398080," have a value and we can clearly see that we can clearly see that but when i try to set that value to"
5398080,5410560," the value input attribute it's not getting set why that is so weird all right so when we're updating these"
5410560,5422480," these things uh uh we're also updating inner text to to the value and whatnot um"
5422480,5437520," so it's almost like it ignores this thing that's what it feels like that's what it feels like okay let's go back to hard"
5438560,5446560," let's go back to hard and zoom value is set appropriately i'm so bad in compute"
5446560,5464400," all right so we're adding this thing into the programs like this so params input and then inner params input"
5466160,5467920," we take we take we take the programs input"
5467920,5470240," stuff"
5470240,5480880," just like why uh all right so what if i do some something very stupid okay uh i'm gonna just"
5480880,5484320," put it in here all right let's just put it in here and"
5484320,5488800," no it didn't it didn't work"
5490720,5496160," it didn't set the value properly it's set it for everyone else but except the zoom"
5496160,5509520," accept the zoom so what if i set uh this thing like this so if param name name uh let's just set all"
5509520,5517520," of them to 69 forcefully let's just set all of them to 69 uh am i gonna am i really gonna spend my entire time"
5517520,5523200," doing that okay so it's set everything appropriately but i don't think it was 69"
5523200,5533440," this is so painful this is such a dumb problem it is so dumb"
5536080,5540480," is that a browser thing uh let me try to do that in firefox"
5540480,5549280," like i don't see what could be the problem like the problem is extremely weird like it's only that"
5549280,5556000," specific value and nothing else like why nothing else but specifically zoom"
5556960,5564560," um okay yeah but if i start to update this thing now it's working but not for the intensity intensity"
5564560,5571440," and everything else is just set properly um so let me try to open that in the firefox"
5571440,5576880," um because that that's that's insane i don't understand i'm i'm wasting too much time on the stupid bug"
5576880,5582240," uh it shouldn't be a thing wasting time on this kind of stuff shouldn't be a thing in my opinion"
5583040,5591040," all right so uh if i go to hard it is the same thing in here it is the same thing okay so maybe"
5591040,5596800," it's not a browser thing maybe it's just specifically mean doing something something wrong"
5597520,5604560," um but maybe setting the value is not like the way you do that um"
5604560,5609200," filter program"
5609200,5618880," value set up you set a value of the value input attribute"
5624880,5625600," i want to die"
5625600,5633360," it's so dumb this is the dumbest shit i've ever seen holy"
5633360,5640320," fuck okay so what if we don't do this kind of stuff okay so we're gonna let these things to be undefined"
5640320,5648400," uh right i hate it oh my god oh my god this is dumb"
5650960,5658720," all right uh-huh uh-huh and the actual value"
5658720,5676000," mean mean max max step step okay so maybe if we go back to value being called init is there some sort of a"
5676000,5681680," collision going on because of that uh i remember okay so we initially called it in it"
5681680,5688000," now let me find to find let me try to find the value right and now it's going to be called in it"
5688000,5694160," let's go let's just call it in it because i remember it worked within it uh but what happened"
5694880,5704640," what the hell is going on seriously uh it's just crazy to string isn't defined okay so to string"
5704640,5710000," for the init sure um okay"
5715600,5727280," what if i also do two string in here"
5736080,5742800," okay okay input slider javascript set value"
5742800,5759920," we have to set the value directly"
5759920,5782880," and really is not set to anything look at them value is just not set to anything"
5782880,5793120," um my range value"
5793120,5808880," wait a second reading um"
5812880,5824640," okay um"
5824640,5826880," okay um"
5826880,5830640," okay um"
5832640,5844400," project to my range"
5859280,5866240," i swear to god if this thing all of a sudden will just start working because there's something"
5866240,5872720," with the cache yet again holy fucking shit all right so do i have"
5872720,5878560," cache disabled for the network yeah disable cache it is disabled or something because sometimes it still"
5878560,5879520," doesn't work"
5879520,5884400," doesn't work uh yeah"
5884400,5893520," value input even though it is set to"
5893520,5905200," value is 1.4 it's almost like it ignores it is it not value was it what is it then am i working with this"
5905200,5909360," this thing incorrectly oh my god i hate it um"
5909360,5917360," html input slider just just just just show me like what am i missing is that they not value"
5917360,5921840," what is it what is it why are you reloading"
5921840,5929680," uh value 90 okay so it's a value it is in fact value like what's wrong"
5930560,5936800," why is it not setting it like it's setting that value perfectly fine for the preview but it's not"
5936800,5943440," setting it like when it needs to be set in here what is going on like holy fucking shit it's setting"
5943440,5948480," it for the rest of the values though and it's successful but specifically for that thing it just"
5948480,5955760," does not set them uh it just doesn't want to do that and it's all in both of the browsers so that means"
5955760,5961760," i'm doing something wrong and i don't know like it's just driving me crazy all right so"
5961760,5967600," i don't know like what is it there's no error or anything like that it's just like"
5973600,5986560," it's working this motherfucker working okay if i put this thing in here"
5994160,5999840," it is not working you see there there are paddings in there but if i put it in here"
5999840,6018480," it is working i know what is going on holy this is so dumb this is this is i'm gonna explain what's"
6018480,6027200," going on okay oh my god i'm sorry for people who do web development professionally every"
6027200,6034800," fucking day i'm really sorry for you guys like holy fucking shit okay so essentially the default mean and"
6034800,6045040," max in slider is one and 100 and the default step is one if you set the value before you established"
6045040,6052160," these things they're going to be evaluated in terms of between one and 100 but zoom um"
6052160,6059920," some of the values especially could be actually bill like below this range right they could be actually"
6059920,6066400," below this range and uh when you apply these limitations it probably snaps them to whatever makes"
6066400,6075040," sense so first you need to establish the mean max and step and only then set a value because the value may"
6075040,6082480," not make sense in the context of default mean max step or so this is the best explanation i can come up with"
6082480,6084560," why reordering this will work"
6088720,6097920," okay so uh maybe uh i am just dumb right i should know this kind of thing uh i should have read a ton"
6097920,6105200," of books before going into web development okay okay okay but why browser didn't even throw any warnings"
6105200,6112880," about that right so why does this development environment makes the life of the developers so goddamn"
6112880,6120080," fucking miserable by default by default right so essentially it could throw a warning saying like"
6120080,6126720," like yeah you're like your value got snapped because min max got updated you could have at least said something"
6126720,6132560," because it's not that difficult to detect from the side of the browser you know what i'm talking about"
6132560,6136880," it's not that difficult to take on the side of the browser and just to warn the programmer like"
6136880,6143040," bro you you did the oopsie doopsie like something's wrong right your value was that but then it got snapped"
6143040,6152480," because min max changed and we don't really change min max that often right for that to be very spammy"
6152480,6154800," in the console if you know what i'm talking about"
6163280,6170000," i guess i have nothing much to say to the fair um i have nothing much to say"
6170000,6187280," i guess whatever i say is not really convincing if you have a stockholm syndrome but i don't know uh so"
6189040,6194960," we now have this kind of and we can set up the intensity i don't really like that intensity just"
6194960,6203360," like jumps around and not particularly smooth but um i suppose this is more of a like a problem of the"
6203360,6210080," of the shader right so it's it's going to be the responsibility of the shader developer to you know"
6210080,6215840," to do this kind of stuff right so in here we're going to zoom in a little bit and the amplitude yeah"
6215840,6221280," the amplitude could be just zero and yeah if you if you set this all to mean parameters it's going"
6221280,6229200," to be like that amplitude is just going to be upset right it's an upset then intensity is uh how quickly"
6229200,6237680," it rotates right how quickly it rotates and zoom is how close it is all right makes sense to me so and"
6237680,6244320," all of that is pretty much customizable all that is pretty much customizable intensity was by default 32 i"
6244320,6258320," suppose it was 125 as far as i know uh 125 right and you can define yourself whatever you mean and zoom was 1.4"
6259120,6269120," um could be a little bit harder and i really like that now you can customize all this you can now"
6269120,6274880," customize all that uh i don't really like that ui jumps around i think it's dumb"
6278400,6285120," i wonder if we can like quite cheaply change it around is there any cheap way to change it around"
6285120,6291120," so essentially here's the parameter name and maybe we're going to have a value preview so if i change"
6291120,6299840," value preview so it's a span uh what if i put that span somewhere here right and the value input"
6300560,6309840," is going to be on the next line right in the div uh let's see what's going to happen uh uh really i'll"
6309840,6321440," forget the semicolon sure uh not bad now we're talking so that looks that looks even better in my"
6321440,6328240," opinion so that's something i would like to ship i would be happy to ship something like this in fact"
6329360,6334720," uh all right so now it doesn't jump around i really like that i really like that so by the"
6334720,6339120," way uh remember how i was speaking about like security and shit like that and not using evolve"
6339120,6345120," uh for evaluating like expressions inside of the parameters and shit like that i just realized that"
6345120,6355840," i forgot uh one thing in here we're using this text as part of the dom but i think it's not that bad because"
6355840,6362800," we're using uh them for the inner text yeah that's right i don't think it's that big of a problem right"
6362800,6372000," um so what we're doing here we just three yeah yeah we put it as a string and string automatically gets"
6372000,6380000," converted into the text node so essentially if i have a parameter uh if i have a parameter that"
6381440,6393280," basically has something like uh script script alert right one i don't think it's going to be that big"
6393280,6401120," of a problem right because that thing is going to be put under the text node uh let me see so"
6401120,6407280," yeah it's under the text so it's it actually doesn't trigger anything so if you put some sort of a script in"
6407280,6416960," here so it's not that bad i suppose it's just the text it's just the text so it's kind of funny how"
6416960,6422240," it didn't even crash anything visibly at least it didn't it didn't even throw anything in the console"
6422240,6429760," right okay so you can create a uniform with this name i mean it didn't create the uniform with this name it"
6429760,6436320," just tried to query the uniform from the shader and it probably received nothing and just yeah"
6436320,6443920," suddenly it doesn't do anything so yeah that's that's fine okay uh that is in fact totally fine"
6443920,6451440," um okay so to be fair some of the shaders may not have parameters but we also put this like"
6451440,6459840," params thingy uh maybe i should do something like uh maybe i need to remove params from here right so"
6459840,6466560," the params are going to be part of the params panel right so here is that and uh it's going to be"
6466560,6476160," something like um text um params there we go is it going to work now um well"
6476160,6485280," one of the things we probably want to do is essentially"
6487680,6507440," if filter params length is greater than zero right only then we go we want to append uh this thing in"
6507440,6516320," there so it's going to be append child text and uh in here we're going to have uh text text text text"
6516320,6524720," params right it's going to be params there we go uh yep yep and something broke uh probably because we"
6524720,6528800," don't have text length unspecified"
6528800,6538640," okay um javascript check if object is"
6543680,6547600," it probably false you object right so uh"
6547600,6554240," so if i do something like node"
6554240,6561760," true false it is true okay"
6561760,6573520," you can get the keys i suppose uh object keys length greater than zero"
6573680,6578960," that means uh we need to append params in there and i think it's gonna now"
6578960,6582000," um so"
6582000,6583440," 9.9"
6583440,6587520," filter params"
6587520,6593120," defined or null to object"
6593120,6594080," ah"
6594080,6597760," yeah some of the if you don't have params"
6598320,6604080," all right so yeah i guess we can just just do something like this okay makes sense all right"
6604080,6608640," all right all right that's that's true so by default you don't have a parameters uh but"
6608640,6612880," for something like heart you're gonna have parameters and it doesn't work"
6612880,6620640," because we don't have text okay so uh let me see let me see we need to introduce text that's for sure"
6624640,6628560," so there is going to be a tag and we're going to introduce text"
6628560,6632720," and it's going to be just something like this we return um"
6632720,6635600," just this thing"
6638320,6646800," uh create text node and because of this we can do something like text"
6646800,6661360," all righty so is it gonna work so you don't have params in here but uh if you do hard if you go"
6661360,6668080," go hard you have ramps in here now and it's kind of weird not gonna lie uh so let me"
6668080,6675280," fix that um i'm gonna go to index for rams and this is just the text and maybe because of that"
6675280,6678720," i want to put a different here and also um"
6678720,6685600," i want it to be centered"
6685600,6690320," i want it to be kind of centered but i'm not sure"
6690320,6696800," uh when it was centered i think it was good but filter is also not centered if you know what i mean"
6697600,6703360," so yeah farms i think when it was centered it was good"
6703360,6712000," so if i do attribute"
6712000,6721600," class i'm gonna put it in here it's gonna be something like this and let me see let me see so"
6721600,6726960," it's gonna be hard and yep it is working it is working"
6726960,6730960," now what i think"
6730960,6739760," whatever we don't need any press it's just like the problem is gone uh yeah you just have prime i mean"
6739760,6745840," i don't have to explain to the user that this is a premise it's actually pretty self-explanatory"
6745840,6752240," this entire stuff is really self-explanatory i don't have to do that uh all right so it's gonna be zoom"
6752240,6758320," uh i don't know maybe zoom should also be zero why not allow zoom to be zero too"
6759920,6770160," why not so it's gonna be hard and and it's gonna be like uh if it's zero it's nothing um i mean yeah"
6770160,6779840," why limit the creativity it's just like allow to be like that um yeah sure and if i restart this entire"
6779840,6785360," stuff it's gonna be hard it's gonna be hard and it's also resets this entire thing uh all right"
6785360,6791440," all right i'm actually super happy with this hard thingy"
6791440,6800560," uh because i can just ship that this already looks good um i can just ship this entire thing"
6800560,6816480," okay so uh let's do a committee committee and maybe then even pushy pushy so what we were working"
6816480,6824400," on uh here is we don't even need this thing anymore i suppose it's nothing essentially if i"
6824400,6830400," refresh this entire stuff heart is going to work as it is oh and by the way i think i forgot to check"
6830400,6835280," how it is rendered right if i do something like this and then it will try to render this entire"
6835280,6841680," stuff is it going to work yeah it did in fact worked uh right and i can just reduce it down to"
6841680,6847840," something like this and then render it one more time uh and it seems to be working okay perfect"
6847840,6852320," so maybe there should be also a way to reset this entire thing but i'm going to create a separate"
6852320,6867360," for the data to do for that um so for rams panel uh there is no reset to default um button in the"
6867360,6879280," forams panel of a filter of a filter there we go so this is one things we want to have um another thing uh"
6879280,6885760," we probably need more interesting types for the um for the prime filters"
6885760,6895520," to be fair all of that does not really need a particular issues okay so reset the default is not"
6895520,6911280," the default is not defined uh what else did i want uh i just straightly forgot what i want"
6911280,6919680," i guess that's fine i guess that's fine i really like slow intensity"
6925360,6934400," all right that's good"
6934400,6945680," oh yeah duration completely forgot about the duration so this feature is not shippable because duration"
6945680,6954240," we need to be able to control duration um as an expression unfortunately this entire sheet is not"
6954240,6962800," shippable and uh actually allowing allowing expressions in the duration is going to take some time right"
6962800,6970320," because you cannot just use eval it is kind of dangerous um we need to implement like a sandboxed"
6970320,6978160," evaluation of some sort uh and also you should be able to refer to the parameters to any sort of uniforms"
6978160,6983200," yeah you should be able to refer to any sort of uniforms and stuff like that so and that's probably what i"
6983200,6988560," i wanted to create in here yes yes yes yes yes uh so let's go to hard right let's go to hard"
6988560,6999520," and um let's maybe put some sort of like a comment in here um i don't know so where is the filters um"
7005120,7017200," filters uh filter params filter params do not support expressions in the strings all right so this is"
7017200,7024080," something that has to be um implemented a little bit later so because duration is not uh uh automatically"
7024080,7030880," automatically calculated based on these parameters it's impossible to do it right now uh i'm not going to"
7030880,7038160," ship this feature i rather gonna put it onto the under the like feature flag so essentially by default i"
7038160,7045040," don't want this panel to be shown right it's not going to be shown but you would be able to enable it by"
7045040,7052640," enabling like a special flag in the url right you'll be able to do something like i don't know um better"
7052640,7059760," right so something like this right or maybe we're going to have like specific flags for specific features"
7059760,7066720," um i don't know something like perhaps right or maybe even feature parents"
7066720,7076000," uh yeah feature parents so and only then this thing is going to show up right so through that you"
7076000,7080800," sure you basically uh express your consent that yeah you know that this feature is not available it is"
7080800,7085360," not finished yet so but by default is not going to be shown i think it's a pretty good approach in"
7085360,7094160," here so let's quickly implement that um so let me see let me see i need to create a separate branch"
7094160,7103360," for this entire stuff so it's going to be more gem and um power rams perhaps parameter uh filter parameters"
7103360,7112560," okay so we're working on this uh thing in here uh 27 27 so it's going to 27 um"
7117040,7124480," implement implement params panel for filters there we go and i'm going to push that right into the"
7124480,7132480," repo so let's actually put it under the feature flag um so i think i already did something like that uh"
7132480,7143600," in uh one of my games uh right so here's the game uh and it used to be written using html5 2d canvas"
7143600,7149280," but then i rewrote it in webgl so this is a webgl version but you can always actually access it via"
7149280,7155600," legacy flag you can put a legacy flag in here and this is the legacy version that is slower uh right"
7155600,7163280," but without legacy flag it uses opengl and whatnot um so i want to do the same thing so i'm gonna actually"
7163280,7173840," give you the link to the game in here so here's the description um this is the w e and here is a w e uh"
7173840,7185920," source code so the source code is available on github of course um all right here it is and i'm gonna steal"
7185920,7193520," some code from this thing right because i already implemented that before all righty so what do we"
7193520,7202800," got uh so basically url search param has okay so this is precisely what we can do in here precisely"
7205200,7216960," uh so can we do it like that basically feature for rams uh feature programs there we go so just"
7216960,7227440," basically at the top put it at the top um maybe it's pretty false going to be false uh and then uh window on"
7227440,7238240," load like here uh feature programs there we go so and how we're going to be using that uh filter uh filter"
7238240,7249360," selector right here's a filter selector and when we are um basically querying so we appending the child"
7249360,7257280," but we're only appending the param panel if the feature params is enabled right only then we're"
7257280,7265840," doing that uh also we're removing the child uh only if the feature is"
7265840,7276320," enabled as well and we're appending this entire stuff only if this entire thing is enabled so basically"
7276320,7281680," the panel is already there the panel is already there every time you select a filter it tries to"
7281680,7286880," create the panel and stuff like that but it will be never put into the dome"
7287600,7292000," unless unless unless you enable that like i wonder if it's going to work because"
7292000,7297200," some things are not really updated if the elements are not part of the dome so i'm a little bit worried"
7297200,7302160," that maybe it's going to create some problems but we'll see we'll test it out uh all right but that"
7302160,7308640," looks like a pretty good solution in my opinion uh something is already broken yay i absolutely love it"
7308640,7316240," so assignment a constant variable okay uh sure thank you for warning me about that at least i really"
7316240,7322000," appreciate that what about heart uh heart is working and as you can see it doesn't have any parameters"
7322000,7330720," right now uh you can do something like feature feature for rams all right feature params has been"
7330720,7339360," enabled and uh you go to hard and now you're able to customize that okay so um by default it is not going"
7339360,7344240," to be released yet this is unfinished feature it is not released but if you're watching this video"
7344240,7351840," and you know about this feature you can play with it already you can better test it right you can just uh drag"
7351840,7358240," these things around and so on and so forth uh but you need to uh basically put this feature parameter"
7358240,7366320," parameter in here right uh so and on the next streams we're gonna finish off this entire stuff and maybe"
7366320,7370880," finally release it so let me actually see if i didn't break anything hopefully i didn't break anything"
7370880,7385280," come on come on all right looks okay uh and let me switch to hard uh okay where's heart i hope this keeps it"
7388240,7396880," uh i don't know what the hell is going on but sometimes my my chromium just gets stuck or something"
7396880,7404240," i don't understand uh finally it works okay so if i try to render this entire thing it should be working"
7404240,7413920," fine now yeah it is working fine all right so i'm super happy uh that we managed to implement that okay"
7418240,7430800," uh uh hide um filter params under under the feature uh flag all right so we're gonna hide it under the"
7430800,7439680," feature flag so um and i'm gonna push that right into the repo do we have the uh pull request let's actually"
7439680,7444960," quickly create a pull request and snitch up all of the to-dos that needs to be uh implemented all right"
7445600,7452960," so what do we have in here uh implement programs panel panel for filters all right so we're not"
7452960,7462000," closing this thing yet we're not closing this thing yet um but we also need to report all of these issues"
7462000,7472800," so it's going to be bin snitch report uh prepend body introduced in uh what issue it was introduced in it was"
7472800,7479120," introduced in 52 all right uh yeah new buffer please the programs do not uh support expression"
7479120,7484320," in strings and this one blocks the implementation of the um"
7484320,7491200," oh basically blocks uh releasing this entire feature uh preload all the filters and switch between"
7491200,7495520," them without uh loading and loading them constantly yeah that would be actually kind of nice there's no"
7495520,7501200," reset to default button in the uh problems uh panel yeah so it would be also nice let's report everything"
7501200,7512080," all right all right uh and let me push everything right into the repo right into the repo"
7512080,7519760," so uh we don't have any ci so i'm gonna just merge that hoping that i didn't break anything if i broke"
7519760,7525200," something feel free to submit an issue uh so i'm going to go to 27 uh"
7525200,7533600," and this one is going to be blocked now right blocked"
7542320,7547760," why are we referring to this thing uh they maybe also prime to similar to"
7547760,7556480," uh okay yeah i see i see what's going on okay it's it's like loosely related but related nonetheless"
7557120,7570880," uh so blocked by uh 53 53 right 53 there we go all right it is blocked by that once this thing is"
7570880,7579360," implemented we can finally release this feature and remove the feature flag um all right okay and i also"
7579360,7585600," uh want to assign this thing uh when i assign this thing on me this is already on me um and i think"
7585600,7592960," we're gucci i think we are in fact very much tamaguchi so let's take a look at our current uh progress"
7592960,7601120," so it's going to feature params here is the feature params and uh here's the hard and you can control these"
7601120,7609840," things now uh if you specify them in the um in the filter definition right so uh let's take a look at"
7609840,7616240," heart so in the filter definition we have a special field for params and each param has a name uh type"
7616240,7623040," its initial value min max and step and so on and so forth um so in the future we're going to actually"
7623040,7630960," support these kind of things inside of the uh inside of the strings and hopefully one day we'll be able"
7630960,7637760," to actually dump filter definitions as json so we can actually export and import them and hopefully it's"
7637760,7643440," going to be safe enough so it's not going to embed any elements into the into the page and it's not going"
7643440,7648960," to uh try to evaluate any arbitrary javascript we're going to try to avoid that as much as possible"
7649680,7655760," so yeah but that will require doing a lot of work that will require doing a lot of work"
7655760,7664240," uh so is there anything i wanted to do i think i wanted to do like a thumbnail before i go right so"
7664240,7674000," a good youtube video needs a thumbnail so um i have an idea for a title so"
7678320,7684560," yeah i need the uh i need the uh i need the zoomer crying name"
7684560,7690400," image yeah this one i'm going to show you just seconds"
7690400,7708160," okay so let me quickly save the image so i'm going to save image s uh zoomer pmg all right so let me"
7708160,7716240," quickly load the zoomer zoom right so and we're going to actually zoom"
7716240,7721920," maybe intensity is going to be like low or maybe amplitude is going to be actually zero uh and"
7721920,7725040," so let me see"
7729040,7732240," uh-huh so essentially this is basically what i want to do"
7732240,7748400," i really i really like that there's a zoomer uh like meme in here and there's also zoom parameter"
7751200,7755760," uh the intensity of zooming yeah so i guess this is going to be the roughly our"
7755760,7763360," our thumbnail i don't know uh so thanks everyone who's watching right now i really appreciate it uh"
7763360,7771680," check out the description for all the links uh of the discussed uh projects in here um and uh i guess i"
7771680,7776960," i see you all tomorrow tomorrow is going to be tuesday and we're going to be um developing our programming"
7776960,7783600," language uh right um and i'll see you all tomorrow thanks everyone for watching thanks everyone for"
7783600,7786240," watching love you"
