400,5600," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session with Mr. Zozin."
5600,12960," So have you heard about like a donut.c? So it's this basically obfuscated c code that looks like a"
12960,19280," donut and acts like a donut. So if you copy paste this entire thing, right, so and I put it in here"
19280,26080," like so, so we're also going to save it and let's actually navigate to this folder in the terminal"
26720,32080," and literally just compile it. So as far as I know you have to compile it with the mathematical"
32080,38560," library, right, otherwise it's not going to compile because yeah, okay, so it has a bunch of warnings"
38560,43120," but I think it at the end it actually compiled, right, so if you try to run this entire thing"
43120,49280," it actually renders a donut. So and it's extremely impressive and it's built all over, it's been all"
49280,53760," around the reddit, it's been all around the hacker news and youtube and everyone holding focus."
55120,62560," So here's an interesting thing, like we had a little bit of a conversation in the discord and"
62560,69120," we were discussing how people do these kind of things, right, so how they create this kind of code."
69120,74400," Well, first of all, they probably just code this kind of program normally and if you look around the"
74400,81440," blog and this blog is actually has a lot of posts about obfuscating c and stuff like that and how they"
81440,86640," do different things, it's actually a very cool blog, I really recommend to check it out. So I'm going to"
86640,91120," leave the link to this website in the description, right, so they do a lot of interesting things but"
91120,96880," not really lately, so the last post was in 2021, right, unfortunately they kind of stopped doing things."
96880,103120," But anyway, so they probably called this kind of thing normally and then they obfuscate it and I"
103120,107840," think the way they obfuscate it is actually, so people asking for the link in the chat, I'm going"
107840,113440," to copy paste it in here. And the way they obfuscate it, they probably do that semi-manually,"
113440,120640," right, or semi-automatic. So what I'm thinking is that maybe they create some sort of a custom tool"
120640,128320," that takes a template maybe as an image, right, maybe as an image and tries to fit the code into"
128320,132320," into the pixels, into the image. Obviously it's never going to be perfect, right, so because you"
132320,137040," if you have a variable you can't split the variable name in the middle quite easily, right, so you have"
137040,142480," to maintain the targets. But still you can kind of maintain the whole shape and if you open, like"
142480,146960," literally open this kind of code, you can see the places where they're cheated."
146960,150960," Like, what the fuck is this shit? And what the fuck is this shit? You didn't have enough stuff"
150960,157680," to actually pad it, so you pad it with the comments. Pathetic. I'm joking, it's actually kind of cool."
157680,158960," Right, so..."
158960,169200," Right, so the way programming languages work, so the way programming languages work is that they"
169200,175120," actually consist of tokens, right. So if you write ""hello world"", write something like this."
176240,185920," So let's actually go ahead and do that, so print ""hello world"", and so then I'm going to compile this"
185920,192640," entire thing, main main.c, and I'm going to run it just to confirm that it in fact works, right."
192640,198960," So what? Oh, because I forgot to put -0 in here, there we go, so as you can see it prints ""hello world""."
198960,205520," So the thing about tokens is that you can have arbitrary amount of spaces between them, right. So if I"
205520,212880," put extra space in here, that is still valid program. It's literally the same program. It is literally the"
212880,219040," same program. As you can see, it works. I can even remove some spaces in here. As you can see, it still"
219040,224800," works. There are some cases when you can't really remove these spaces between the tokens, right. So I"
224800,230960," can't remove this space. So some tokens are very much special and they need space between them."
231200,236880," So, for example, int and main. Otherwise, this is not a valid program, right. It's not going to work."
236880,242640," So it needs at least one space in here. But you can have no spaces in here, even though we can have"
242640,246320," infinite amount of spaces in here. So look how much"
247280,255840," leeway you have into how you format the code. You can do a lot of stuff just between the tokens and it's still"
255840,263520," going to be a valid C program. It is still a valid C program. This is a valid C program, right. This is"
263520,271040," absolutely a valid C program. Look at it. Fucking look at this shit. Or maybe something like this. So there is a"
271040,278640," little bit of a problem with a preprocessor. And this is probably why donut.c doesn't have any preprocessor"
278640,285600," directives. So in fact, it needs functions from the mathematical library, like sine and cosine. And what"
285600,291200," it does, it just forward declares those functions. It literally just forward declares them because it"
291200,298240," doesn't want to use the preprocessor. Like, look how many tricks they did in here. Look, they padded this"
298240,303280," shit with the comments. They didn't use any preprocessor or anything like that. And oh yeah,"
303280,313440," people are talking about k. This is basically a quirk of the old C, right. In old C, you didn't have to"
313440,319200," specify the type of the variable, right. So you could just do something like this and you defined a variable"
319200,325920," x with the default value integer, right. So with the default value integer, right. And this is one of the"
325920,333120," tricks you can do in here. Right. And essentially we can exploit this property of the C tokens, right. And"
333120,339680," if we had a C tokenizer, we could try to do that sort of semi-automatically, right. So, and we're probably"
339680,349440," going to be using the C tokenizer from nothings by the creator of STB. So I really don't like the tokenizer"
349440,356080," because it's kind of difficult to use. So it has some pitfalls that are very easy to fall into."
356080,362240," Uh, so let me actually find it. I think it's a Lex. It's a C, uh, Lexa. Yeah, there we go."
362240,366400," So they have a C tokenizer. And this is probably the thing that we're going to be using in here. It's actually"
366400,374880," kind of big. Uh, right. So I'm, I want to take the current thing, uh, the current thing. So it takes a little bit of time. Yeah, there we go."
374880,379840," So I'm going to put that in the description, and this is probably the thing that we're going to be using in"
379840,388160," here today. Um, right. So, and what's interesting is that there is another example of this kind of"
388160,396240," situation, right. So there's a blog post by, uh, Benji, right. So I think like he's, I know him as a"
396240,402720," person who worked on WebAssembly and promoted, uh, pure WebAssembly programming. I don't know,"
402720,410160," there was a name for this kind of style. Um, right. So he had a name, a row, row wasm. Right. So he"
410160,416400," promoted like this style of programming in WebAssembly where you program directly in WebAssembly and do"
416400,422320," different cool things. Right. I know him from these kind of things. So I also recommend to check out his"
422320,427920," his blog and stuff like that. Uh, the last thing he kind of did is, uh, maybe not the last one,"
427920,433360," but the last one that I remember is a Game Boy emulator that plays only one specific game, which"
433360,438480," is Pokemon Blue. Uh, right. I never had Game Boy. I never actually played Pokemon games because I'm"
438480,442960," coming from a different part of the world. Right. So yeah, people in a different part of the world"
442960,446960," exist, right. From a different cultural background. So you'll have to deal with that,"
446960,453520," with that fact in your life. Uh, right. So, and what he did is just like, he also formatted his code"
453520,459120," with like a pokeballs. Right. So let me, let me take a look at that. So that's a lot of stuff. Yeah,"
459120,466880," there we go. Uh, something like this. Right. So it's like another sort of instance of this entire thing."
466880,471840," So, and I wanted to kind of try to do the same thing. Right. So I wanted to try to replicate this"
471840,478080," meme. And the question is like, what can we do? Like what kind of program can we, uh, implement"
478080,484400," and then obfuscate? Right. So, and since I'm keep using like Conway's Game of Life as an example,"
484400,490400," when I try out new languages or new technologies or new different things, I thought, why not just like,"
490400,496800," implement, uh, like a donut style, but Conway's Game of Life in the terminal and obfuscate it in"
496800,502160," the shape of something. So, and the question is going to be, uh, what's going to be, uh, the shape,"
502160,506080," right? So what's going to be the shape? The obvious thing would be probably maybe a shape of glider,"
506080,510720," but it's kind of boring. Glider is just like a very pixel. It thinks it's just like, I don't know."
510720,515920," I was thinking that maybe I could make it in the shape of a face of John Conway."
515920,523680," Right. So if we try to Google up like a John Conway, uh, Conway. So maybe we can take some of"
523680,529600," his photos. Uh, so there's this iconic photo, which I really, really like. So it's him. Like it's, it's"
529600,534000," very, very recognizable. Right. So if you know about John Conway, you probably saw this photo. We could"
534000,541360," take his face. Right. And maybe use, um, padded quantization that we implemented some time ago to"
541360,548480," actually bring that photo to a monochrome palette. Right. So basically white and black, right. To"
548480,555440," monochrome stuff and maybe reduce the resolution down. So it, it fits like, it looks like ASCII art and"
555440,561920," then just feed the code into, into the shape of his face. Right. So imagine like a Conway's Game of"
561920,567200," Life in your terminal in the shape of the John Conway, the creator of the Conway's Game of Life."
568640,572400," Right. So that, that sounds interesting. Right. So that sounds interesting. And this is something we"
572400,579280," can try and we can try, try to take a look at the, um, you know, we can try to reuse the palette quantizer"
579280,586000," that we implemented some time ago. Uh, right. So I wish I could find the video where we did all of that."
586560,598640," Um, right. So let me try to find quantizer. So maybe something about palette palette. I can't find that."
598640,604240," Like, does anybody remember how I called that project? I literally can't remember. I remember"
604240,613040," that I only implemented it, but I don't remember how I called it. Uh, so, um, seam carving, seam carving was"
613040,621040," about a different algorithm. Um, damn. I don't remember. Does anybody remember chat? Does anybody"
621040,631600," remember? Um, and if I even forgot. Oh, I think it was something about what's the mid something,"
631600,637440," something mid point K means. Yeah, that's right. It wasn't not about specifically, uh, palette quantizer,"
637440,644240," but it's about the K means implementation. Right. So K means, uh, right. So came. Oh,"
644240,651360," it's so fucking slow. Oh my God. Freaking Microsoft is killing one of my favorite websites yet again."
651360,659040," Fuck you, Microsoft. All right. So K means, um, no, it's, it's not, it's not there. So means, uh,"
659040,666240," I can't find it. I literally can't find it. It's impossible to find. Uh, right. So"
668320,677520," Oh my God. It's, it's so bad. Um, okay. So I wonder if I can just, uh, use a search engine. So"
677520,686640," sorting key means clustering, clustering, uh, GitHub. Can I just Google that and find this thing there?"
686640,698000," Yeah. Like, no, but it doesn't say sorting data mine. It was data mining and see. Okay. So, okay."
698000,703280," Here's the thing. Okay. Okay. Okay. Like, I don't remember how this thing is called, but aren't we"
703280,711440," living in an age of AI where it's supposed to understand your intent and actually find you the"
711440,716080," thing that you mean? Like, aren't we like already went through entire fucking AI revolution and now"
716080,721760," we're living in a completely different world where we don't even have to think and put any effort into"
721760,726080," search and the AI does everything for us. Aren't we living already in that? Where the fuck it is?"
729440,737600," Anyways, I'm sorry. Uh, so like what, why are they gathering so much fucking information about me,"
737600,741840," but incapable of providing like a basic thing that just like finds what I mean?"
742480,752480," Uh, right. So data mine in C. Just saying, just saying, uh, right. So this thing, right. So,"
752480,758160," and this is actually kind of cool thing. So let me, I think I already have it maybe, um, here cloned."
758160,765440," Uh, there we go. So, and if I do build, uh, what is it? I think it's a 3d and it can provide some images."
766080,773440," Uh, so let's actually use LENA image 64. So we have LENA image. Yeah, there we go. So this is basically"
773440,781120," a small LENA image, right? So this is a small LENA. Uh, and if I try to run this small LENA, what is it"
781120,792800," called? 3d image LENA, uh, LENA 64 PNG. Uh, there we go. So, uh, basically we take all of the colors, uh, in"
793680,801760," and put them in 3d space RGB. Right. And then we're trying to cluster it into four different colors"
801760,806400," into palette of four colors. Right. So I press space and basically quantizes this entire thing"
806400,812080," and creates a palette. Right. So, and after that, I suppose I have to save it, but I don't remember"
812080,819360," what's the key to save this entire thing. Uh, right. So it should be something like is key pressed. So yeah."
819360,824960," So to save this entire thing, you have to press S, uh, right. And it saves it into output PNG."
824960,831520," And, um, where, yeah, there we go. Here's the output PNG and there we go. It created output PNG."
831520,837840," So, uh, what I'm thinking is that we can take the conveys face and actually ask it to cluster into two"
837840,845040," colors. Uh, right. And then turn it into black and white and just use that as the, um, as the shape"
845040,851040," that we're going to put into, like as the shape that we're going to use to turn the code into. Um,"
851040,857680," right. So that's basically the idea. And it gives us an opportunity to reuse some of the, um, um, some of"
857680,862720," the tools that we developed before. Right. So it's basically, we have a, you know, cross-referencing"
862720,869200," between the things that we implemented on the stream. So I should probably maybe give, uh, the link to"
869840,874720," the stream where I developed this entire thing. So, but I don't remember how the stream was called."
874720,883760," So I'm going to put it to do for myself, uh, to be done link to the string for data mining in C."
883760,889840," Uh, there we go. So the first thing, the first thing we have to do, we have to implement like a"
889840,896560," terminal game of life that we're going to obfuscate and turn into some sort of a shape and image and stuff"
896560,902000," like that. So let's go ahead and do that. Let's go ahead and do that, my friend. So should be pretty"
902000,906480," straight forward, should be pretty straightforward. So we have a little bit of garbage in here. So let me"
906480,912560," remove all of that. Let me remove all of that. So, and we're going to have a conway.c. Right. So,"
912560,919280," and let's just do a hello world. Let's just do a hello world. I'm going to print up. So again,"
919280,924320," I'm going to just implement it as it is without trying to obfuscate it or anything like that."
924320,931440," I'm going to do the obfuscation, uh, phase after we established how the program will behave and stuff"
931440,937200," like that. Right. So maybe we need to do a little, a little bit of a building in here. So I kind of"
937200,941920," want to use make files today. Right. So this is a throwaway code anyway. So I didn't plan to support"
941920,945360," it in long term because of that, I don't really care about using knob or anything like that."
946000,951920," Um, okay. So we are going to be building Conway. Uh, right. And we're building Conway from here."
951920,958880," Right. So this is going to be just ccoconwayconway.c. And since I also have a donut in here,"
958880,963280," maybe I'm going to be doing, do I need the donut honestly? Maybe I don't. Let's actually remove"
963280,969040," donut. I don't think I need it. Um, all right. So let me try to rebuild this entire thing."
969040,973520," So it seems to be a building. It seems to be working. If I try to run this entire thing,"
973520,980560," it says hello world. Okay. So let's actually define the size of the, of the board on which"
980560,987120," it's going to happen. Right. So let's define rows. Uh, let's say it's going to be 32, uh, by 32."
987120,992240," All right. And I'm going to have like, um, um, two buffers. Right. So I still haven't figured out"
992240,999200," how to do a single buffer, um, game of life, but I heard that it's possible. Uh, right. So you just"
999200,1005840," have a fixed size buffer that is sort of like looking around, uh, and then you have only one buffer where"
1005840,1009840," you do all of the computations and stuff like that. Maybe we're going to do a stream at some point where"
1009840,1015600," I will try to figure out how to do like a single buffer, um, you know, Conway's game of life, but it's not"
1015600,1019920," going to be today. It's not going to be today. Anyways. So we're going to have a front buffer."
1019920,1024960," Right. So, and it has this amount of rows and this amount of columns. Right. So maybe I want to actually"
1024960,1029280," fill it with zeros. Right. And, uh, we're going to have a back one. Right. So we're going to have a back"
1029280,1036560," one. Cool. So one of the things I want to have is an ability to display the front. Right. So I want"
1036560,1042640," to have an ability to display the front. So, uh, let's actually do display. Uh, and what we're going to be"
1042640,1048720," doing in here, we're going to just iterate, uh, all the, all the cells and just print them."
1048720,1057120," So zero, uh, Y rows plus plus Y. Uh, all right. And this is going to be something like X and this is"
1057120,1065120," going to be columns, uh, something like X. All right. So essentially we're going to treat one as, um,"
1065120,1071120," alive and zero as dead. Right. So because of that, I think it would be super easy for us to do something like"
1071120,1078000," this, uh, if, uh, front. Right. We're going to print that it is alive. Right. So we're going to just print"
1078000,1085360," app, uh, like this. And otherwise we're going to actually print that is, it is like this. And then"
1085360,1092320," we need to print the sort of like a new line here. So there we go. If I try to display this entire thing,"
1092320,1097280," let's actually see what is going to happen. So I'm going to do something like this. Uh, there we go. So we've got,"
1097280,1104400," this is actually a lot. Is it really 32 by 32? Uh, it is actually, right? 32 lines. Oh yeah. This is"
1104400,1110000," because the font. All right. So maybe we can reduce the amount of rows. Yeah. So it looks a little bit"
1110000,1115200," more squarish. Right. I think, I think that's fine. So, and maybe we should initialize the glider."
1115200,1119520," All right. So the glider usually looks like something like this. All right. So it's going to be like that."
1119520,1126000," And then here we have, uh, something like that. So, and if you basically index those things,"
1126000,1132320," they're going to kind of look like this. All right. So this is going to be, um, zero. Right. So let's put"
1132320,1143920," it like that zero one, two and essentially front, um, zero, one is true. Then the next one is one, two,"
1143920,1153120," and then two, zero, one, two. This is the glider. And if I try to, there we go. So here is the glider."
1153120,1160880," So it seems pretty cool. It seems pretty cool. Um, so, and after that, we need an ability to maybe"
1160880,1167920," compute the next state. All right. So this is going to be the next, uh, right. And what we essentially do,"
1167920,1173280," uh, we are basically iterating this stuff again. Maybe I can even copy paste this entire thing."
1173280,1179600," Maybe I can even copy paste this entire thing. Uh, right. And for each of these things,"
1179600,1184000," we need to count the neighbors, right? So maybe we're going to have a special thing in here,"
1184000,1191920," neighbors, uh, for X and Y, right? So let's actually have it like this in here. Count neighbors. We accept"
1191920,1197680," the cell for which we're going to actually count the neighbors. I kind of want to call it CX and CY,"
1197680,1201840," because it's going to be a center of the square that we're iterating. You know, the usual trick,"
1201840,1206160," you probably, if you watch my streams, you know what I'm implementing in here. You probably know exactly"
1206160,1209360," what I'm implementing in here. There's nothing particularly new for you in here."
1209600,1214400," So we're going to be iterating a small square, which is three by three with DX and DY, right?"
1214400,1221440," So from minus one to one, like so, uh, this one has to be actually called DX. And this one is going to"
1221440,1228080," be DY. And we're going to be ignoring the center of that cell. The center is when DX is equal to"
1228080,1235040," zero and DY is equal to zero. That's the center. And we're kind of like negating that. And this is,"
1235040,1240960," uh, basically the cells that we care about, right? So in here, essentially the current cell,"
1240960,1249120," the neighbor cell is X, CX plus DX, and then Y, CY plus DY. But then you can actually go out of bounds,"
1249120,1254800," right? So because of that, you need to use a little bit of a mode, actually proper mode that is capable of"
1254800,1260240," working with negative numbers. So we're going to implement it very quickly. You also saw that multiple"
1260240,1264640," times, probably if you watch my stream, but if you knew, maybe you're learning something new right now,"
1264640,1271760," maybe you are, maybe not, maybe it doesn't matter. Uh, right. So let's actually do a mode B plus B. This"
1271760,1276800," is a proper mode that is capable of working with negative numbers because the usual classical mode"
1276800,1282480," is incapable of doing that, believe it or not. Right. So if you just like use something like, uh,"
1282480,1290000," node.js, right? So, and if you try to do minus one, 100, right, it stays minus one. It's only the Python"
1290000,1294480," that is capable of working with this kind of things. And maybe Lua, I don't quite remember. But anyway,"
1294480,1299600," SICK also is not capable of working with all of these things. Not because it's something with the language"
1299600,1305360," per se, it's just like the, uh, on the low level, the Intel CPUs do not support this kind of stuff."
1309440,1315920," So anyway, um, all right. So what we're going to do in here, we're going to basically see if front"
1315920,1322960," yx is equal to one or just front yx, we're going to increment, uh, neighbors plus one. And then we're"
1322960,1327680," going to just return this identity. That's it. That's the implementation of the count neighbors."
1327680,1333440," So we counted the neighbors in here. And if I remember correctly, uh, so it all depends whether the"
1333440,1342960," current thing is alive or not, right? So if front yb, yx, I mean, uh, is alive, that means we have to"
1342960,1351040," check. Uh, so it stays alive when there's two or three neighbors. And if it's less than two or greater"
1351040,1357200," than three, that means they die either, uh, either of under population or overpopulation. So that's how it"
1357200,1362800," works. So, and it's quite easy to code it like that. We recently discovered you just check, uh,"
1362800,1370480," neighbors equal to neighbors equal to, or neighbors equal three. Uh, right. So, and otherwise, if it's"
1370480,1377600," dead, it becomes alive only when it's equal to three. Maybe we can even do something, something like this,"
1377600,1385040," where we just take back, right, and essentially use the ternary operator, ternary, ternary, ternary,"
1385040,1393760," I don't freaking know, uh, ternary operator, right? Something like this. Uh, so, looks okay. So that's"
1393760,1399920," how we compute the next sort of thing. So, uh, but after computing the next sort of thing, like, we won't"
1399920,1404720," be able to see that because display only works with the front buffer. So what we have to do, we have to"
1404720,1409280," copy the back buffer into the front buffer. It's actually relatively straightforward, right? So you"
1409280,1416640," just do memcpy, uh, back, front, uh, and just size of all these things, right? So we're going to be just"
1416640,1423520," doing it like that. Uh, all right. So what do we have in here? And, uh, it didn't work per se because we,"
1423520,1428880," first of all, didn't display anything. Also, we have a bunch of warnings, right? So, and we're all going to be,"
1428880,1433680," uh, having warnings, uh, right? Because you can't really obfuscate without a warning."
1433680,1440480," And literally nothing happened, even though we did the next. So what the fuck is going on in here?"
1440480,1445760," It's because I have to do the opposite copying, right? So I have to copy back into the front."
1445760,1452640," Uh, it's more. Yeah. So this is the next state of the, uh, of this thing, right? This is the next"
1452640,1458000," state of this thing. And so the only thing you have to do here effectively is just put that in a loop,"
1458000,1463600," uh, like so. You just have to put that in a loop. Maybe we don't even have to have this extra display,"
1463600,1470400," just something like this. All right. So display, um, display, next, mem copy, and so on and so forth."
1470400,1475920," And to be fair, like, since display is kind of used only once and next is kind of used only once,"
1475920,1481920," we could actually enlighten them, uh, those obfuscating it even more. So that sounds like a"
1481920,1487120," good idea, but the application is not really finished yet, right? Because I want it to be like,"
1487120,1492400," um, you know, like the donut, right? So it actually animates the thing, right? So what's the difference"
1492400,1497120," between while true and for? One is while loop and another one is for loop. That's the difference."
1497120,1503360," So, uh, right. So let's actually try to run it. And as you can see, it is animating, right? But it's"
1503360,1508640," actually not really animating. It's not cleaning up the, the terminal, right? It is not cleaning up the"
1508640,1514960," terminal. So, uh, one of the things we have to do, we have to use the terminal escape codes. And, uh,"
1514960,1520960," one of the things I usually do is just like, I use the code that moves the cursor to the left top"
1520960,1526160," corner, right? And redraws it again. And that creates the effect of the animation, right? So"
1526160,1531200," that creates the effect of the animation. In fact, I implemented literally this kind of thing in Porth"
1531200,1538320," in the past, right? So maybe I can steal those, um, codes from Porth. Let's actually see. So there was"
1538320,1545440," example, um, where is the game of life? So here is the game of life and the escape codes look like this."
1545440,1554320," Okay, so let's actually take them, um, and I'm going to just bring them in here. Uh-huh. So, and this is"
1554320,1560320," the stuff we're doing in here. So first comes the escape code, uh, right? So we're going to print F. Escape"
1560320,1568640," code in the octal, uh, numeric system is 033. Then we put open bracket. Then we have to put the amount of rows."
1568640,1574720," Then we have to put A in here. Don't ask me why this is just like escape codes, right? So this is just"
1574720,1580960," the escape codes, nothing special. Uh, and then in here we have to do D, uh, right? And that automatically"
1580960,1588400," moves, uh, this entire, like the cursor to the left top corner, right? So to the left top corner, uh,"
1588400,1593280," there we go. So let's actually try to do that. And in the terminal, it's probably not going to work"
1593280,1599520," that well. Uh, right. So it's just actually like in Emacs, I meant, I meant in Emacs, it's not going to"
1599520,1608800," work that well. So let's actually do that in the terminal and yeah, it goes, right. So it's interesting."
1608800,1614720," We kind of need to slow it down. And the question is in case of a donut, right? So if we take a look at"
1614720,1620880," the donuts of the freaking donut, do they sleep anywhere? How did they do that? So sleep,"
1620880,1628480," sleep is nowhere in here. Do they have like a for loop, um, that just slips a little bit? Um,"
1628480,1636400," I wonder how the fuck they do that. Uh, I don't really see any slips. Maybe it's naturally that slow."
1637360,1646240," It could be just naturally that slow. 628. Ah, but I mean, it's just, it's not really waiting. It's a"
1646240,1654000," nested loop. It's not an empty loop. It's not an empty loop. It's just a nested like outer loop that,"
1654000,1661040," you know, just iterates something. Uh, right. So it has nothing to do with slowing this entire thing down,"
1661040,1668080," but maybe that doesn't really matter per se. Uh, CPU goes. So maybe the thing here is that"
1668080,1674480," it's just like nature is slow, right? It's just naturally slow. Uh, but anyway, so we can,"
1674480,1682640," well, we can try, we can just try to do for, I don't know. So how, how many, I think like 1 million"
1682640,1688320," is kind of nothing for a modern PC. So what about 2 millions? Uh, right. So I think that could be,"
1688320,1694160," that could be interesting. Uh, so let's actually try to do that. Conway. That actually made it slower."
1694160,1700880," That kind of made it slower. Uh, what about like 4 millions? Right. So now if we try to do it like"
1700880,1708000," that, eh, one of the things we can just do, we can just use usleep. Uh, right. So I kind of don't"
1708000,1714160," like this solution, but it makes it less portable. That's the problem with usleep. It makes it less,"
1714160,1721360," less, uh, portable. Um, so we can say, so it's, it's a microseconds, right? If I'm not mistaken,"
1721360,1726720," what's the, uh, what's the arguments? I didn't see use seconds. So it's a microseconds. Micro. Yeah."
1726720,1732160," Yes. It's a microseconds. Okay. So that means if I want to put 100 milliseconds, I have to do a"
1732160,1737840," thousand of them. Right. So it has to be a thousand of them. All right. So if we try to do something like"
1737840,1744800," this, uh, yeah, that's already reasonable, that's already reasonable. Um, okay. So maybe we could"
1744800,1751040," make it even smaller. Uh, so what if we, uh, like divide it in half? Like, I don't think for a single"
1751040,1755600," glider, it has to be this. Yeah. So that looks good. That looks cute. Look at that. Look at that."
1755600,1764480," That's pretty cool. It's actually pretty cool. I really like it. So, okay. Um, we can basically keep"
1765280,1772320," this entire thing as the original, um, you know, original conveys game of life. Right. So, uh,"
1772320,1779600," maybe we're going to just go ahead and say, this is a rig. Uh, and in here we are going to change that."
1779600,1788080," Uh huh. Dot or rig. And there we go. So, because I want to copy it and now manually obfuscate it a"
1788080,1794640," little bit, not to turn into, into specific shape, but just obfuscate and apply some of the obfuscation"
1794640,1800480," tricks. Like for instance, um, you know, don't use int when you define integers and stuff like that."
1800480,1805920," So stuff like that. Right. So I want to obfuscate it. So this is a original that I developed for humans"
1805920,1811920," to read. And then we're going to start obfuscating things. Conway.c. Uh, so how can I call it obfus?"
1811920,1817600," Right. So let's call it obfus. Um, right. And we're going to actually put that in a make file as well."
1817600,1822400," I'm going to copy paste this entire thing and I'm going to replace our rig with obfus."
1822400,1832720," obfus. And maybe we want to do like a phony target which sort of builds all of them. Right. It builds all"
1832720,1841920," of them. There we go. All right. So, uh, let me now see. We don't want any pre-processor. That's the problem here."
1842560,1847520," That's the problem here. We don't want includes. So we kind of obligate you to get rid of the includes."
1847520,1854240," Um, okay. So that's fine. Right. So we are just using like implicit declarations, but that's fine."
1854240,1859760," Right. Because we're not trying to make like a super correct, uh, C or anything. We're just trying"
1859760,1866400," to obfuscate it. Right. So implicit declaration, fine. We can do that. So defines. Let's actually go ahead"
1866400,1871840," and inline all of the rows in here and all of the columns. Right. So query plays a row. Uh, this is"
1871840,1876560," going to be eight and just inline this shit. So we get rid of that and let's go ahead and maybe inline,"
1876560,1883600," uh, this shit, uh, with, uh, 16. There we go. So we got rid of all of these things in here."
1883600,1889520," So another thing I would like to maybe do, uh, let's actually see if it compiles. Right. It in fact"
1889520,1893840," compiles. Right. So if I take a look at the, uh, can you even see what the fuck I'm doing? All right."
1893840,1898320," So opfus. Right. So opfus works. Right. So even though we got rid of all of the pre-processes,"
1898320,1905200," all of that still works. Uh, so let's actually inline display. Right. So since it's used one time,"
1905200,1910240," it kind of like, there's no point in doing it like that. Right. So let's actually just inline the whole"
1910240,1916880," thing in here. Uh, all right. So let's just inline it and get rid of the, of this thing. And I think"
1916880,1923040," the same goes into the count neighbors. Right. So count neighbors is kind of used only once. I didn't see any"
1923040,1930640," reason to actually have a separate procedure for this entire thing. So we can just come, uh, compute"
1930640,1939360," it, uh, inline, but here's an interesting thing is that, so the center is called the CX and CY,"
1939360,1945440," which means that that outer loop should also refer to CX and CY. So maybe this is something that we have"
1945440,1953040," to change as well. Right. So CX and CY. Um, right. And here we really have to do CX and CY."
1953040,1962560," CY. So, um, all right. So you may say that it's unreadable and I will tell you that's the point."
1962560,1968960," Do you know the definition of word obfuscation? Google it up. That's the fucking point to make it"
1968960,1974320," unreadable. Uh, right. So what do we have in here? Is it still working? Yeah, it is still working. It is"
1974320,1981440," still working. So this is kind of cool. So, uh, we can also try to maybe, yeah, we can try to inline"
1981440,1987040," modes as well. Who said we can't fucking do that mate? Who said we can't fucking do that mate? We"
1987040,1992800," can't fucking do that. Fuck you. Right. So we're going to do that plus, uh, then, uh, this thing,"
1992800,1999520," and we can also wrap that stuff around like so, and then another time more. There we go. So"
1999520,2006800," there you go. Now we have this kind of thing. Um, all right. So let me see if it still compiles,"
2006800,2011760," uh, it's still working. It is still working. Actually, let's actually let it wrap around because"
2011760,2016880," I'm not 100% sure. Okay. So I didn't fuck up copy pasting of the mode. Uh, all right. So"
2016880,2023920," that's, that's cool. That's cool. So, and again, next is also used only once. So that means we can"
2023920,2029360," probably maybe inline this thing, this thing as well. Uh, right. So now it's going to be just a"
2029360,2034480," single main function. Who said we can't do that? We can fucking do that. Uh, let's, let's get rid of"
2034480,2038080," these comments. Right. So you're not supposed to actually understand what the fuck is going on."
2038080,2046720," All right. So, uh, right. This, this is actually pretty freaking cool. And you know, what's funny is that we only"
2046720,2054080," use integers in here. So in case of a donut, the author of the donut had to explicitly define"
2054080,2060320," things like float, char, and some other bullshit, some other bullshit. So we don't have to do that."
2060320,2065120," We don't have to do that at all. We only use an integer. So that means we can probably"
2065120,2073040," maybe predefine all of these freaking variables, like X, Y, C, Y, D, X, like, like at the top"
2073040,2079360," and get rid of these integers in here. Right. So we can get rid of them, making it even more cryptic."
2079360,2084480," I think that's a cool idea. I think that's a cool idea. So we should probably do that."
2084480,2090400," Um, Oh, I just got that like a very low hanging front. I think we can do some shit like,"
2090400,2094560," yeah, I think we can do something like that. Wait a second. So print F"
2095200,2101840," And for fuck sake. Oh my God. Um, yep."
2101840,2109920," Um, so put char, we can try to use put char. Is it a shorter? Bruh."
2116480,2127040," print F is shorter. Come on, man. You all are wrong. People, you all are wrong. Put C"
2127040,2135040," accepts the stream. So I can't just do put C. It has to be put C plus stdl. None of you know C."
2135040,2140960," None of you know C. Which is good, right? So it's a shady language."
2142720,2146000," Right. So you're not supposed to know C. Like learn programming, not C."
2146000,2158560," Learn Pascal. Pascal is a better language than C. Trust me. Maybe you should start promoting Pascal."
2158560,2164960," Right. So yeah, I'm kind of tired of this, like a C versus JavaScript meme."
2166240,2173440," We should bring back Pascal chat. What the fuck? Okay. I really need to think about that."
2173440,2178000," Like I need to start like really fucking pushing propaganda about like Pascal."
2178000,2187520," Yeah. Because you can do like in free Pascal, you can do a lot of cool shit, right? If you can like"
2188480,2194480," use OpenGL bindings to do some impressive looking shader and shot like that, you can actually convince"
2194480,2200960," Normies that it's the next big thing after Zig. So yeah, I think if you start pushing this propaganda"
2200960,2207040," using like a very heavy visual stimulating things on Twitter, Normies will be actually convinced that"
2207040,2212400," this is the next thing, right? So that it's actually coming back because that's how it works, right?"
2212400,2218480," So I'll think about that. I'll think about that. So anyways, uh, what do we have in here?"
2218480,2227680," Like dude, you won't believe like 80% of the work of the influencer on the internet is basically psyop."
2227680,2234080," Like seriously, like anybody, anybody who does that profession will tell you, yeah, that's basically psyop."
2234080,2244160," Right. So we're just independent psyopers. Uh, so to be fair, uh, marketing is commercial propaganda, isn't it?"
2244160,2248400," It was just like you have a state propaganda and then you have commercial propaganda and"
2248400,2252080," commercial propaganda is called marketing. So that's what it is. So"
2257440,2267360," anyways, what is psyop? It's, um, it's a big, next big thing after devops, right? Who needs devops?"
2267360,2269760," Everyone should learn psyops."
2269760,2276640," To be fair, the way our world is going, that's probably true, but let's not go into that. Um,"
2278400,2289920," um, wait a second, you know, there, okay. So there is software development and there is a system"
2289920,2294480," administration, which is called devops these days, right? So you, you have software development,"
2294480,2305440," developers and devops. So then in parallel, you have hackers, right? And you have psyops, right?"
2305440,2310720," psyop to happy hacking is like devops to software engineering. That's what it is."
2310720,2318160," You see what I'm talking about? Right. So psyop is a dev op for hacking."
2318160,2324400," It's called social engineering. Yes. It's called social engineering, but I mean,"
2324400,2329600," devops was also called like system administration. Um, yeah, I know about"
2329600,2334800," bullshit propaganda that devops is actually software developers also doing system administration,"
2334800,2344000," but I don't fucking buy that. Okay. So it's not how it ends up being anyway. So anyways, um,"
2344000,2349840," let's see what we have in here. So we probably need to, yeah. So it seems to be working. It seems to be"
2349840,2357040," working. How else can we obfuscate this shit? Uh, so there's a little bit of an interesting thing in"
2357040,2366400," here. We kind of iterating the board twice, right? But can we just merge these two things,"
2366400,2373680," right? So essentially here, I can first print the current cell, then I can compute the next one in the"
2373680,2380800," back buffer. And then at the end in here, I can, yeah, so we can print and compute the next thing"
2380800,2386560," simultaneously. Who said we can't do that? We can't do that. We can actually do that. So there's nothing"
2386560,2392160," wrong with that. Um, all right. So let's actually see, uh, what do we have in here? So I'm going to"
2392160,2397760," rebuild that didn't work. Fuck you, leather man. Fuck. Oh, because it's actually CX, CY. All right."
2397760,2402240," So that makes sense. Fair enough. Fair enough. They had different naming. Um, all right."
2406640,2424480," The fuck. How did that happen? Excuse me. So CX. So that, if I go back in here, uh-huh."
2427600,2437600," Huh. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Printed accept char. Ah, yes. So, yes. So, this is where we, okay."
2437600,2444240," Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much. You saved the stream. You saved the stream. Uh, maybe because of"
2444240,2454000," that something like put, uh, putsy. Ootsy, putsy. Ha ha ha. Ootsy, putsy. Is it going to be shorter? That's the real question."
2457600,2472480," I hate it. I hate it. I, I fight it. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ah, mm. It's literally the same. Putchar, um, putchar,"
2472480,2479520," char. Yeah, putchar is actually kind of shorter this time. But whatever. Doesn't really matter. Uh, so,"
2480160,2485280," let's actually go in here and put it like that. Miney, friendly, miney, friendly."
2485280,2499440," Okay. So, we have it here. So, it seems to be, yeah, there we go. So, it becomes more and more unreadable."
2499440,2504800," I love how it becomes more and more unreadable. And the question is, are we going to have even have enough"
2504800,2511520," tokens for the conveys space? I'm not really sure. Maybe I should not remove tokens, but maybe it's fine."
2511520,2521360," Whatever. So, um, let me see. Can I simply get rid of int space everywhere? Can I just do that? Like,"
2521360,2527600," everywhere? We don't define those things anymore. Uh, is that a good idea? So, then later I can define all"
2527600,2537040," these things in here. So, x, y, c, x, c, y, d, x, d, y, n, and br. So, right. So, let's actually see if I"
2537040,2543440," can do that. Okay. So, that seems to be working. That's pretty cool. And here's the trick. You don't"
2543440,2550320," have to put int in here. So, you can just do things like this. And it automatically defines all the"
2550320,2554960," variables in here. Like, you literally don't have to do that. Uh, honestly. Right. So, uh, yeah."
2554960,2559280," It seems to be working. So, and the question is, like, can I actually not provide these kind of"
2559280,2565840," things in here? I think, I think I don't have to. Yeah, I don't have to. And since defining the array"
2565840,2572400," is part of the name, right, it's whatever comes after the name that defines whether it's array or not,"
2572400,2578080," I feel like I can actually move these things in here, but I'm not sure if they're gonna, like,"
2578080,2584000," zero initialize those things. So, since this is a global static memory, I think it's gonna be zero"
2584000,2588800," reinitialized, but I'm not 100% sure. Right. So, I'm not 100% sure. Okay. It compiles."
2588800,2599680," It works. I fucking hate C. So, this is a valid C. Guys, this is a valid C. I'm fucking telling you."
2599680,2606320," So, it puts it in BSS. Yeah. So, BSS is automatically zero doubt. Um, so, one of the things we can do,"
2606320,2620400," we can probably quickly replace front with just F, and back with just B, and, yeah. So, we can just put"
2620400,2623040," a little bit like that. Uh, yeah."
2623040,2631760," So, can we remove integer in here? I think we should be, yeah, yeah, we can remove integer in here. So,"
2631760,2636640," none of that is neat. Look how, look how much bloat you have in a modern C."
2638400,2646080," Let's just use old C. This is how old C used to look like. No bloat whatsoever. Look at that"
2646080,2653360," shit. It's beautiful. It's fucking beautiful. I'm fucking telling you, mate. I'm fucking telling you."
2653360,2659680," Anyways, so, um, can we even simplify that further? So, I feel like maybe this, ah, this one could not be"
2659680,2665600," simplified, I think. Um, some of this stuff could be probably simplified, right? So, we don't really need"
2665600,2674720," these extra things in here, right? So, yeah, we can remove that stuff. Uh-huh. And it still works,"
2674720,2682240," actually. It still fucking works. It throws a shit ton of warnings, but it works, right? So, and, uh,"
2682240,2687440," since, like, you, you have a lot of freedom into how you align your tokens, you can even do shit like"
2687440,2693680," that, right? So, uh, this is basically the code. It compiles and it works."
2693680,2701040," Remove the return. Oh, okay. So, we can try to remove the return as well. So, uh, is it going to be that bad?"
2701040,2706640," Because it never actually quits, right? So, because you have an infinite loop, uh, right? So, here's an"
2706640,2712000," infinite loop. And since it never quits, like, what's the point of returning zero? I agree with that,"
2712000,2719440," actually. Um, right. So, I agree with that. So, let's actually do something. Holy fuck. The warnings!"
2719440,2727600," Look at the warnings, right? So, uh, so, type defaults, definition has no type or storage code. That's,"
2727600,2734880," that's fine. That's, that's fucking fine. Anyways, uh, so, we got these codes, right? So, and yeah. So,"
2734880,2741520," and that basically could be the final code that we want to use in here, right? Um, and what we need to do,"
2741520,2747760," we just need to put it into a shape of, uh, Conway's face. So, if we kind of, like, estimate how much"
2747760,2753200," stuff we have, right? So, we can say that maybe the width of the whole thing is going to be like this."
2753200,2762800," How many rows would you have if you were to turn it into ASCII art of Conway's face, right? So,"
2762800,2768080," we can do things like that. So, we're splitting specifically by tokens. Um, we're splitting"
2768080,2782160," specifically by tokens. Um, actually, more than I expected, honestly. Um, okay. Uh-huh. All right. So,"
2782160,2787600," I think we can do some stuff in here. It's just like, we need to pick a good resolution for this"
2787600,2797360," entire stuff. Uh-huh. And, yeah. Something like this. Okay. So, roughly. But this is not the maximum"
2797360,2803680," size. That's the thing. This is not the maximum size. I would say that this is roughly the minimum size."
2804240,2809680," Because if it's going to be, like, a monochrome image, uh, you're going to have, like, a space"
2809680,2816160," between those things. And the more spaces you introduce between the tokens, the more tokens you"
2816160,2821760," have, the higher resolution you can actually represent. So, this is not the upper bound of the"
2821760,2830240," size of the image. It's actually lower bound. So, this is good. The fact that we have this much,"
2830240,2834480," this much room to work with, it is actually quite good. I think we can turn it into something cool."
2834480,2842000," Um, right. So, yes, yes, yes, yes. Let it continue. Oh, yeah. You can always do things like this,"
2842000,2846400," uh, where you actually represent these two things as separate tokens. Like, there's a lot of different"
2846400,2853520," tricks you can do to, uh, you know, to, to help you out like that. So, might as well maybe do it like"
2853520,2860080," this. But it's still kind of big. So, I can still split it like that. Uh, right. So, yeah. So,"
2860080,2867280," maybe we can even bake that into the tool. Uh, so, if it sees the string literal, it kind of splits"
2867280,2873760," that string literal into several of them, if it, if it needs to, right. So, uh, and we can do stuff"
2873760,2879360," like that. And again, if we don't have enough space, uh, right. So, we can always cheat a little bit,"
2879360,2885840," like, uh, the donut creator, right. So, if you take a look at the donut, they cheated as well. Look at that."
2885840,2891600," Like, look at all of that. They thought that we're not gonna notice that. They, they thought they're not"
2891600,2899280," gonna notice. They took a bite out of the donut and they tried to hide that. They tried to hide that."
2899280,2900880," They actually took two bites."
2900880,2909920," SMH by H. SMH by H. But we're not gonna try to bite the convey's face."
2909920,2918320," Anyways. Uh, all right. So, that's pretty cool. So, this is sort of like an obfuscated version."
2918320,2923920," Uh, let me actually put it like this and I'm going to just to rebuild this entire thing and confirm that"
2923920,2928000," it's still working. It is still twerking. That's actually pretty cool. Well, it looks kind of"
2928000,2935360," impressive, I think. Does it not look impressive? So, I can even try to post that. Can I post that as a tweet?"
2935360,2944720," Ah, it doesn't fit. So, if we're going to 66 characters, um, it doesn't really fit as a tweet,"
2944720,2950080," unfortunately. But we can make a screenshot, right? So, if something doesn't fit as a tweet,"
2950080,2955840," you can also always make a screenshot, right? So, I guess that's fine. Anyways. So, I already"
2955840,2960400," stood for one hour and I want to make a cup of tea. I want to make a small break. And after the small break,"
2960400,2968320," we're going to what? We're going to try to prepare the image. Uh, so, the, the target. So, the target image."
2968320,2973680," So, basically, the image that we want this code to turn into, right? We want to quantize the palette."
2973680,2978080," Uh, we're going to do all these things. And then, we're going to try to write a program"
2978080,2984560," that splits all of that into tokens and loads the image and basically uses the image as sort of a guide"
2984560,2993040," to adjust the tokens and try to turn it into the face of, uh, John Conway. So, sounds good. Sounds good."
2993040,3003840," So, Tomaguchi, let's go. All right. So, let's grab Conway's, uh, face. All right. So, this one, uh, let me,"
3003840,3012160," let me see. Can I, okay. So, I'm probably going to save, um, okay. Can I, okay. So, I'm saving it. Um,"
3013360,3020800," we're probably going to be saving it somewhere in here. Uh-huh. So, I don't really know what's the"
3020800,3025920," copyright of that face, but I mean, I'm going to be doing it in a very transformative way, hopefully."
3026640,3032880," Uh, right. Hopefully, hopefully, hopefully. And it's too big, honestly. It is too big. Uh, so,"
3032880,3035440," the question is what we're going to be including. I think I want to include"
3036320,3041120," the entirety of the head, honestly. Kind of the entirety of the head because the shape of the hair"
3041120,3048160," and beard kind of very iconic in a sense. So, I think all of that has to be included. All of that"
3048160,3053920," has to be included. Okay. So, we need to kind of cut off the face. Uh, so, let's open it in Krita."
3053920,3060160," Krita is actually kind of heavy. Um, right. So, we'll see. We'll see. We'll see."
3066080,3080640," Um, just use Gimp. So, the problem with Gimp is actually kind of interesting, at least on Debian,"
3080640,3086800," is that if you installed Krita, you can't really install Gimp for whatever freaking reason,"
3086800,3093280," because Debian considers them mutually exclusive or something, some shit like that. They consider"
3093280,3098320," them to be, like, alternatives of each other. Like, I don't remember. I tried to have them both."
3098320,3102880," So, you got them both. They kind of fixed that. But, uh, yeah. Like, in old Debian, like,"
3102880,3107760," for some reason, I just couldn't have both. And it was so fucking stupid. Like, I just, I just can't."
3107760,3114720," Imagine somebody who doesn't know anything about, like, drawing and, you know,"
3114720,3122480," you know, modifying images and stuff like that. Oh, it's two image programs! Mutually exclusive!"
3123040,3127440," Like, I literally imagine it like that. It's just like, oh my god."
3127440,3136000," Um, so, anyway. Look, I can actually imagine somebody go like this. Oh, it's, it's,"
3136000,3143760," they're doing the same thing! The mutual exclusive! Um, all right. So, I wonder if I can just get rid"
3143760,3150800," of the background or some shit like that. So, we need some sort of an AI. Is there any online, like, a tool,"
3150800,3156160," where I can upload an image and it just removes the background? Does anybody know? Something like that."
3156160,3162880," Without, you know, you know, logging in or signing in. Remove BG. Okay. So, let me, let me take a look."
3162880,3168240," Uh, thank you. Thank you so much. That's actually super cool. Uh, save as..."
3170880,3177680," So, conway, uh, head. So, what was that? Was it JPEG? Yeah, it is JPEG. Uh-huh."
3177680,3181760," Uh, it doesn't load for me."
3185040,3192560," So, it could be have been Goatsy. You just clicked it. Um, actually, Chaterina knows about it. So,"
3192560,3198080," that's the thing. Remove images automatically. Don't spend hours manually picking pixels, right?"
3198080,3205360," I mean, I can open it in, in a separate window, right? So, if it's a Goatsy, only I will see that."
3205360,3212640," No Goatsy for you, Chaterina. You've been bad today. I'm not going to show you any Goatsy. So, yeah."
3215120,3222960," Dingboard, it requires signing in to remove background. So, it has some features like behind"
3222960,3228400," signing in. And I can't sign in on this machine, unfortunately. Uh, yeah. Remove BG doesn't open,"
3228400,3241600," right? So, um, so, wait, I need to see Goatsy. I'm sorry. You've been too bad lately. So,"
3241600,3248160," I can't show you Goatsy. Okay. Remove background, uh, from image online. Let's see what we can have."
3248160,3257520," Uh, remove background. Okay. So, it's remove BG. But, I mean, I think, I think they just basically,"
3257520,3261440," they're banned in Russia. Like, I'm pretty sure they're banned in Russia or something."
3261440,3270480," Um, image to go remove background from H for free with AI. All right. Yo, that is epic. Can I just"
3270480,3281600," choose the image? So, let's go. AI. AI revolution. Let's go, bled. Sorry. So, what was that? Conway. Right."
3281600,3293280," So, Conway's hat. All right. We can have different models. Yeah. Did it work? Okay. So, start."
3301040,3306400," ""Do you know we introduced a new tool for creating AI generated Atten?"" Oh, I didn't know that. Uh,"
3306400,3309600," no?"
3309600,3317360," Oh, it's, it's still loading, I suppose. It is still loading. Um,"
3320080,3324240," I could have actually, you know, remove the background myself quicker, I think."
3324240,3327280," Um,"
3327280,3336560," You are in the queue. I see. Oh, it worked. Yo, what the fuck, brother?"
3336560,3342720," What the fuck? Okay, okay, okay. So, the magic of AI."
3348560,3350640," What the fuck is this?"
3350640,3356720," I mean, that's, that's not bad, actually. That's good. That's good. I think, I think that's good."
3356720,3364160," Uh, X style. It's, it's basically, okay, right. So, if we compare them, uh, all right. So, there's"
3364160,3365440," Conway's head. Yeah."
3365440,3370800," It's so fucking funny. It's just..."
3374800,3379040," Uh, um, anyways. That's so fucking funny."
3379040,3395840," So, this is, uh, downloads and Conway's head. Uh, let's go. So, we need to change it. Uh, no BG."
3395840,3402880," Uh-huh. And I'm gonna put it in here. So, we have Conway's head and Conway's head without any BG."
3403600,3410080," So, all right. Let's actually open that, uh, in the, in the thing. So, Conway, um, you know,"
3410080,3418560," Conway had me. Right. So, this one is gonna be PNG. Right. And this is probably, like, I wanna continue"
3418560,3425040," sort of, like, working with that. So, maybe Krita, like, recently got some models, AI models to remove"
3425040,3428880," backgrounds, but I don't really know. Don't really know. Don't really know."
3428880,3442480," It's fine. It's not bad. Uh, so, we wanna probably remove X. So, there's a little bit of a bug in Krita,"
3442480,3448160," but, yeah, there we go. I can, I can remove that myself. See? I don't need AI for this stuff. I don't"
3448160,3453760," need AI for this stuff. So, I'm just not sure if I wanna keep the shoulders or not. If you know what"
3453760,3458720," I'm talking about. Like, I'm really not sure if I wanna keep them. Or is it just gonna be a head? Like,"
3458720,3465360," I think shoulders kinda give him, like, more muscular power. So, without the shoulders, he's just, like,"
3465360,3470560," flying head. But, like, yeah, I think shoulders are kinda cool for, for this kind of situation."
3471840,3477120," Yeah. So, keep them. I'm just a little bit afraid that maybe they're gonna take up too many tokens."
3477120,3485200," Uh, right. But, that's probably fine. So, uh, can we resize the, the whole thing? Image, uh, resize canvas."
3485200,3492960," So, this is too big. If we're gonna be having, like, um, smaller image. Right. So, what's gonna be the"
3492960,3501280," easiest way to go about that? Uh, so, let's try it first, resizing it. Let's try first resizing it,"
3501280,3508160," let's say maybe it's gonna be, uh, 32. Uh, no, it's, it's not a great idea to do it like that."
3508160,3516720," Uh, because I wanna actually preserve the ratio. That's what I wanna do. Uh, so, I need to connect"
3516720,3527280," this entire thing. And let's say this is gonna be 32. 32 by 35. Uh-huh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, John."
3529920,3534240," You know, it's like the meme of leaking the, uh, the, the lemon."
3534240,3546960," Um, mm-hmm. So, we actually need to resize the image, I suppose. Um, now that was"
3546960,3552720," resize canvas offset image scale in. Okay. Scale image to new size. That's what I wanted. All right."
3552720,3560640," So, 32. Uh, there we go. So, is that better? Is that better? It could be better, actually. All right."
3560640,3566800," So, it could be better. So, let's go ahead and save the whole thing. All right. So, we're saving the whole"
3566800,3573440," thing. And I'm gonna be closing that. So, yeah. So, it doesn't have to be, like, very precise with a lot"
3573440,3578320," of details and stuff like that. It has to be kind of recognizable, right? So, and that photo, I think, is"
3578320,3585600," very much iconic and recognizable. So, if you see the shape of photo of the John Conway, I think you will"
3585600,3592640," recognize him. If you know who he is, of course, right? Um, so, yeah. Let's go into the data mining in"
3592640,3597280," C and I'm gonna copy paste his head in there. So, and in here, what we're gonna be doing, we're gonna be"
3597280,3606960," doing, um, the data mining. Um, so, uh, 3D, right? So, this is a 3D Conway's hat and let's just open it up."
3606960,3613680," There we go. Uh, okay. So, here we have four colors. Let's actually see how it's gonna look like with four"
3613680,3620560," colors. I think it's gonna be interesting. So, the third color having a hard time hitting the palette,"
3622000,3629440," which is rather funny, isn't it? I think it's funny. Oh, finally, it actually found it, right?"
3629440,3636320," It was having, like, a really hard time, like, finding its place. But, yeah, it's finally found it."
3636320,3648800," Okay. So, if you take a look at the output in here. So, the output looks like this."
3651360,3654320," We lost hair, I think. I think we lost hair."
3654320,3660960," Um, yep."
3660960,3670000," Okay. So, what if we reduce the amount of... To be fair, like, from far away, from far away,"
3670000,3674800," it kind of looks all right. It kind of looks all right, maybe. Or maybe I'm just coping."
3675600,3683520," That's the problem. Um, so, maybe we just should have some sort of a background in here."
3685200,3695600," yeah. Uh, so, let me go to Conway. So, let's get rid of this thing and this thing. Uh, and I'm gonna"
3695600,3703920," copy-paste the Conway head mini one more time. So, I feel like there should be no transparent background."
3703920,3711120," I think it should be, like, straight up black. Because we're losing the hair. And I think that hair,"
3711120,3715840," this Wolverine hair, is kind of important for Conway. You know what I'm talking about?"
3716880,3723360," Yeah. He's like a Wolverine of, uh, of, of math. That's who he is, right? And we don't want to"
3723360,3729280," strip him off of his identity. So, uh, let's go ahead and try to do that one time. So, we're gonna"
3729280,3732000," put, like, a black background. Um,"
3732000,3739440," Why don't I make a completely different color? Like, hot pink. It doesn't matter. The color doesn't"
3739440,3744080," matter. All right. So, what matters is the relationship between the colors, right? So,"
3744080,3749600," because it's going to be monochrome anyway. So, we're trying to come up with an image that looks"
3749600,3755200," kind of like a Conway, uh, even in monochrome. That's what we're doing, right? A specific color"
3755200,3758960," doesn't matter because it's going to be ASCII anyway. There's no colors in ASCII, right? There's"
3758960,3766480," only text. Um, anyways. So, let's actually get rid of the X, uh, like so. And I'm going to create another"
3766480,3770880," layer. Can you see I'm creating layers in here? It's actually behind my camera, but yeah, I'm creating a"
3770880,3776800," new layer. And maybe I'm going to just, like, put, like, a black background, right? Because I want his"
3776800,3783680," Wolverine hair to stand out. I want it to stand out because I think it's important. Look at that. Look at"
3783680,3791200," beautiful man. Like, this is the definition of the math chad. Like, you won't, you won't find the"
3791200,3797520," more chadis mathematician in, like, in your entire life. Seriously. Just look at him. Just look at him."
3797520,3808640," He's judging you. Anyways, uh, so we got that. So, let me try to save this entire thing. And, uh, let's"
3808640,3816880," resize, actually scale image to the new size. So, we did 32. What about 64? Is it going to be too much?"
3816880,3823360," I think it's too much because it's going to be like... Let me take a look at the obfuscated thing. How"
3823360,3834640," many characters we have? Yeah. It roughly amounts to 32 by 32. So, like, 32 by 32 is the, uh, resolution we're"
3834640,3841680," dealing with, unfortunately. It's the resolution we're dealing with. Uh, scale image to the new size. 32."
3841680,3851680," This is a 35. And let's go. I think, like, I hope we're gonna end up with, um, actually good thing in here."
3852800,3859680," I hope so. Yeah. All right. So, I'm saving this stuff. All right. So, I'm saving this stuff."
3859680,3867840," And let's go. So, this is me. All right. And, uh, data mining in C."
3867840,3877360," Uh-huh. So, it's min. It's a previous one. It doesn't matter. So, mini. Okay. This is with the black one. All right."
3881200,3888000," Okay. So, let's see. So, I suppose the fourth color is gonna wander around a little bit"
3888000,3895840," until it finds its way. Maybe I should just, like, right away try to do two colors. Okay. Let's not"
3895840,3901200," waste time on four colors. Let's actually go ahead and straight up do three of them. Like, two of them."
3901760,3908000," Uh, the question is. Yeah. So, here it is. So, k is basically the amount of colors. So, let's actually do two."
3908000,3915360," And see if it's going to, you know, produce anything. So, here we do knob. Let's rebuild the entire of this thing."
3917840,3922800," So, and, uh, let's just go ahead and do that. Wait. It didn't work?"
3922800,3930000," What the fuck? Excuse me. So, when I was rebuilding this thing, was it rebuilding?"
3930000,3936080," It was just rebuilding k-means. Did I actually come in? Yeah. Okay. So, some of this stuff is"
3936080,3941440," commented out. That's fine. That's fine. Uh, all right. All right. I figured that out. So, we're building everything."
3945440,3953440," It's going to be more than 32, 35 because of the background not containing characters."
3953440,3964640," Yeah. Sure. Anyway. Um, so, let's go. Okay. It, it found it. Okay. So, it quickly found the palette."
3964640,3968720," Let's save the palette and hope for the best."
3975440,3977440," *Rain*"
3977440,3991440," *Rain*"
4005440,4021440," It looks okay from far away, but I mean, bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh, that is bad, that is fucking bad."
4021440,4027440," So overexpose the origin so it becomes white and add the black background."
4027440,4029440," Maybe it's a good idea, actually."
4029440,4033440," So, I don't know, like, it feels like it's going nowhere."
4033440,4037440," I feel like it's going nowhere."
4037440,4041440," Maybe I'm wasting my time in that."
4041440,4053440," So, the other option that we may have in here is the glider, but the glider is kind of boring, honestly."
4053440,4055440," Definitely potato, yeah, like, it looks like potato."
4055440,4061440," I think, like, trying to do something like that is gonna be huge disrespect to John Conway, so I think we're not gonna do that."
4061440,4063440," What about three callers?"
4063440,4065440," It's not about the callers, people!"
4065440,4067440," We have only two callers!"
4067440,4069440," Oh my God!"
4069440,4071440," What is wrong with you?"
4071440,4073440," What is wrong with you?"
4073440,4079440," We're working only with two callers."
4079440,4081440," So let me, let me see."
4081440,4083440," So, yeah."
4083440,4087440," So we're, like, losing a lot of information."
4087440,4089440," It's like..."
4089440,4089440," It's like..."
4089440,4093440," It's the lack of the hair that makes it look kind of derpy."
4093440,4095440," But I mean..."
4095440,4097440," Even if the hair becomes..."
4097440,4099440," It just looks like a potato."
4099440,4101440," It just looks like a potato."
4101440,4103440," It's so fucking funny."
4103440,4121440," Anyways, I suppose we're gonna be doing, I guess, you know, the glider, right?"
4121440,4127440," So that's the second best thing that we can have in here, some sort of a glider."
4127440,4129440," All right."
4129440,4133440," So let's go ahead and just do that."
4133440,4135440," I'm not gonna remove these things."
4135440,4137440," Let's have Conway."
4137440,4141440," And I'm gonna just move them all into that folder."
4141440,4144440," Move them all into that folder."
4144440,4145440," All right."
4145440,4151440," Let's actually start writing the tool that is going to help us to automate all of these things."
4151440,4153440," Right."
4153440,4157440," Image, maybe image format."
4157440,4159440," Let's call it image format."
4159440,4165440," So I suppose it's going to accept the source code, right?"
4165440,4169440," And it's going to accept an image and it's gonna try to tokenize the code."
4169440,4175440," And as it tokenizes, it tries to sort of feed that into the image, so to speak, if you know what I mean, right?"
4175440,4178440," So we'll see how it goes."
4178440,4185440," So let's go ahead and just like include this kind of thing and main and so on and so forth."
4185440,4191440," We need to download the tokenizer."
4191440,4193440," Let's quickly do that."
4193440,4195440," I need a raw version of this tokenizer."
4195440,4197440," I don't really like this tokenizer."
4197440,4197440," Right."
4197440,4202440," Again, it's so easy to shoot your foot with it, with how it is implemented."
4202440,4204440," But I mean, it's free."
4204440,4205440," So I'm not really complaining."
4205440,4206440," Right."
4206440,4207440," So thank you."
4207440,4209440," Thank you to Sean for providing this thing for free."
4209440,4212440," I could write it myself, but I'm a little bit later."
4212440,4215440," Nicholas Daniel, I hope I pronounced your name correctly."
4215440,4218440," Thank you so much for subscription with the message."
4218440,4220440," Years watching Zozin, but five months watching subscribed."
4220440,4221440," Yay."
4221440,4222440," Yay."
4222440,4223440," Indeed."
4223440,4224440," Yay."
4224440,4225440," Indeed."
4225440,4226440," All right."
4226440,4227440," So what do we have in here?"
4227440,4229440," So I'm going to just do wget."
4229440,4232440," And let's download it."
4232440,4233440," Let's go."
4233440,4234440," All right."
4234440,4235440," Okay."
4235440,4236440," So we've got this thing."
4236440,4240440," I think I need to add image format to here."
4240440,4241440," All right."
4241440,4247440," So this is going to be thing that depends on image format C and we're going to just compile"
4247440,4251440," it as anything else, as anything else."
4251440,4254440," Um, so I want to enable a lot of warnings."
4254440,4255440," Right."
4255440,4258440," So the warnings are not really important for the obfuscated versions."
4258440,4259440," Right."
4259440,4264440," Because the obfuscated versions, like we don't care if it like adheres to some sort of like"
4264440,4266440," strict pedantic standards or anything like that."
4266440,4268440," We're just like trying to obfuscate."
4268440,4269440," Um, okay."
4269440,4271440," So let's try to rebuild the whole thing."
4271440,4274440," Uh, so by the way, I need to close this stuff."
4274440,4275440," It kind of makes it slow."
4275440,4276440," Uh huh."
4276440,4279440," And image format."
4279440,4280440," It actually build it."
4280440,4281440," Right."
4281440,4284440," It shits a lot of warnings, but these warnings are from the obfuscated version."
4284440,4285440," So that's fine."
4285440,4286440," Uh, all right."
4286440,4290440," So in image format, we're going to be including the tokenizer."
4290440,4291440," Right."
4291440,4294440," So let's include the tokenizer."
4294440,4301440," And if you take a look at the tokenizer, you need to also include the implementation like"
4301440,4302440," so."
4302440,4304440," So let's try to rebuild the whole thing."
4304440,4306440," And it has a little bit of warning."
4306440,4310440," So there's an unused function in here for whatever freaking reason, but whatever."
4310440,4312440," Uh, how do you use this tokenizer?"
4312440,4313440," That's a very good question."
4313440,4315440," Honestly, that's a very good question."
4315440,4318440," So I suppose, I think I need to accept the arguments."
4318440,4322440," And since I'm kind of accepting arguments, like I want to be able to parse them."
4322440,4325440," And also I need a way to read an entire file into the memory."
4325440,4329440," That sounds like a job for knob."
4329440,4332440," Um, thank you so much develop land for Twitch prime."
4332440,4333440," Thank you."
4333440,4334440," Thank you."
4334440,4335440," Um, yeah."
4335440,4336440," Alrighty."
4336440,4341440," So what is the, what is this thing?"
4341440,4343440," Where can I get the knob?"
4343440,4344440," I need a knob."
4344440,4347440," I can take the knob from panima, I suppose."
4347440,4348440," Right."
4348440,4351440," Because that's the last project I was working on, which is a C project."
4351440,4355440," So, and in here we have knob.h."
4355440,4356440," Okay."
4356440,4357440," All right."
4357440,4359440," So, and now in image format."
4359440,4363440," And since I'm actually brought knob in, might as well just start using it."
4363440,4364440," Uh, or something like that."
4364440,4365440," Right."
4365440,4368440," So like for, for building and everything."
4368440,4372440," So I didn't really initially wanted to use it for building."
4372440,4374440," But now since I have it, I might as well do that."
4374440,4377440," Because the, the building script is actually super simple."
4377440,4377440," Right."
4377440,4379440," So who said I can just like use that?"
4379440,4381440," Um, I can."
4381440,4382440," Um, anyways."
4382440,4385440," So what we need to do, we need to have the program."
4385440,4387440," It's going to be knob."
4387440,4389440," Um, shift args."
4389440,4392440," So we're popping the args out of here."
4392440,4397440," And then we're checking if args is less or equal than zero."
4397440,4398440," What we have to do."
4398440,4405440," We have to throw an error saying that you didn't provide shedbrev usage program."
4405440,4407440," Um, input C."
4407440,4409440," So we're going to accept only C for now."
4409440,4411440," We're going to, you know, extend it in the future."
4411440,4415440," Might as well just do usage and put this into a separate thing."
4415440,4420440," So then I know what kind of stuff I have to modify when the usage actually changes."
4420440,4423440," So in here, we're going to just return one."
4423440,4424440," There you go."
4424440,4429440," So, and then in here, we're going to do input path, maybe input C path."
4429440,4434440," And it's going to be knob shift args, arg C, arg V."
4434440,4435440," There we go."
4435440,4441440," And next thing we need to do, we need to take the knob and read the entire file."
4441440,4443440," That's the function we need in here."
4443440,4444440," Right."
4444440,4448440," So we provide the input C, input C path."
4448440,4451440," So we need to also have the string builder."
4451440,4455440," So the buffer into which we're reading all of that, like so."
4455440,4461440," And if this entire thing has failed, we have to return with non-zero exit code."
4461440,4470440," But if it returned with a zero exit, like with true, that means the string buffer already contains the content of this entire thing."
4470440,4471440," Right."
4471440,4474440," It contains the content of the, contains the content of the file."
4474440,4475440," Right."
4475440,4476440," So that's what I was trying to say."
4476440,4477440," Anyways."
4477440,4482440," So we can try to print the content of the file just to ensure that everything is working correctly."
4482440,4483440," Right."
4483440,4485440," So we can use F right."
4485440,4487440," Size T F right."
4487440,4490440," Let's grab this thing like so."
4490440,4492440," So here we have to provide the pointer."
4492440,4494440," So the pointer is B items."
4494440,4498440," The size is the size of a single sort of element."
4498440,4504440," We can assume that the, we have buffer as the single element and we just print in that single element."
4504440,4507440," And let's just print all of that to the STD out."
4507440,4508440," Like so."
4508440,4511440," And that's basically it."
4511440,4512440," That's basically it."
4512440,4514440," I'm going to try to rebuild the whole thing."
4514440,4516440," It's still complaining about some warnings."
4516440,4520440," Oh, this is actually valid because here we have to accept the program."
4520440,4524440," We have to accept the program and we're going to put the program in here."
4524440,4526440," What else do we have in here?"
4526440,4528440," So we have to provide the program in here."
4528440,4529440," What else do we have?"
4529440,4529440," Okay."
4529440,4530440," Everything seems to be Gucci."
4530440,4532440," Everything seems to be Tamaguchi."
4532440,4535440," If I run this kind of thing, it says, you know, nothing was provided."
4535440,4537440," It actually didn't say shit."
4537440,4539440," We should do something like STD error."
4539440,4540440," Error."
4540440,4546440," No input, no input C program is provided."
4546440,4548440," All right."
4548440,4550440," And we're going to put this stuff like this."
4550440,4553440," So we're going to even rebuild it one more time."
4553440,4554440," Okay."
4554440,4557440," And now it says no input C program is provided."
4557440,4563440," So now we can provide that input, which is going to be Conway obfuscated dot C."
4563440,4563440," Right."
4563440,4565440," And as you can see, it printed the whole thing."
4565440,4568440," So we know how to read the entire file."
4568440,4570440," Okay."
4570440,4572440," So what's the next thing we need to do?"
4572440,4575440," We need to actually create LaTokenizer."
4575440,4576440," LaTokenizer."
4576440,4579440," How we're going to be creating the LaTokenizer."
4579440,4581440," So let's take a look at this thing."
4581440,4583440," I think you just create an instance of the Tokenizer."
4583440,4584440," Yeah."
4584440,4586440," So you just create STB Laxa."
4586440,4588440," Let's go ahead and do that."
4588440,4593440," I'm going to just go and say STB Laxa is just L and zero."
4593440,4594440," And zero."
4594440,4595440," So we're going to zero initialize it."
4595440,4598440," We're going to allocate it on the stack."
4598440,4599440," On this stack."
4599440,4608440," All right."
4608440,4611440," So and then we initialize LaTokenizer."
4611440,4612440," LaTokenizer."
4613440,4616440," So here we provide the pointer to the Laxa."
4616440,4617440," Okay."
4617440,4618440," InputStream."
4618440,4620440," So here we're providing the..."
4620440,4622440," Basically these things."
4622440,4625440," So we provide the items."
4625440,4627440," And then we have to provide the stream end."
4627440,4630440," So in our case, I think it's pretty easy."
4630440,4632440," So we just provide items plus count."
4632440,4633440," Right."
4633440,4635440," So because it's going to point at the end of this thing."
4635440,4642440," And we also need to allocate a little bit of a storage for storing strings and stuff like that."
4642440,4643440," Okay."
4643440,4645440," So we can pre-allocate it somewhere here."
4645440,4646440," String store."
4646440,4648440," Let's allocate maybe one kilobyte."
4648440,4651440," I think one kilobyte is going to be enough for everybody."
4651440,4653440," For every string."
4653440,4654440," At least for our case."
4654440,4655440," Right."
4655440,4656440," So at least for our case."
4656440,4657440," So I'm going to provide this thing."
4657440,4660440," And we also have to provide the size of this store."
4660440,4664440," So in knob, we have knob array length."
4664440,4667440," Which automatically computes the length of the static arrays."
4667440,4668440," So we can actually use that."
4668440,4669440," String store."
4669440,4670440," And there we go."
4670440,4671440," We initialize deluxer."
4671440,4672440," We initialize deluxer."
4672440,4675440," So I can try to recompile the whole thing."
4675440,4677440," Recompile the whole thing."
4677440,4678440," Right."
4678440,4680440," And as you can see, it seems to be working."
4680440,4682440," I don't really know why the fuck it is..."
4682440,4683440," Oh."
4683440,4685440," Oh, because I do -b."
4685440,4686440," That's why it rebuilds everything."
4686440,4687440," Okay."
4687440,4688440," So that seems to be working."
4688440,4689440," That seems to be twerking."
4689440,4690440," So we have a tokenize."
4690440,4692440," But the question is, how do we use it?"
4692440,4693440," I don't remember, honestly."
4693440,4698440," And every time I tried to use it, I had huge trouble."
4698440,4699440," Honestly."
4699440,4702440," So what do we have?"
4702440,4704440," Stb."
4704440,4705440," C."
4705440,4706440," Lexa."
4706440,4708440," What kind of functions do we have?"
4708440,4709440," Get token."
4709440,4710440," Okay."
4710440,4712440," So let's take a look at the documentation."
4712440,4719440," The function returns non-zero if a token is parsed or zero if at end of file."
4719440,4731440," Token is the token ID, which is a Unicode code point for a single character, less than zero for a multi-character or end of file or error."
4731440,4732440," Okay."
4732440,4734440," So that's very interesting."
4734440,4736440," So this is a multi-character."
4736440,4737440," All right."
4737440,4738440," All right."
4738440,4739440," All right."
4739440,4746440," Real number is a double constant value for clex float int."
4746440,4749440," That's very interesting."
4749440,4750440," Okay."
4750440,4751440," So in all of that."
4751440,4752440," Uh-huh."
4752440,4755440," So string is for identify."
4755440,4756440," Okay."
4756440,4757440," That's cool."
4757440,4758440," That's cool."
4758440,4759440," Was it actually documented before?"
4759440,4760440," I kind of don't remember."
4760440,4764440," I remember I had problems realizing that..."
4764440,4765440," Wait."
4765440,4771440," Was it like recently modified or something?"
4771440,4775440," Clex, sister of Clitoral."
4775440,4776440," Yes."
4776440,4780440," Clex is the sister of Clitoral."
4780440,4782440," So when was the last changed?"
4782440,4783440," Three years ago."
4783440,4784440," Okay."
4784440,4785440," So it was not modified."
4785440,4787440," That means I'm a dummy who doesn't know how to reach yet."
4787440,4788440," So that's fine."
4788440,4791440," That's really common for me, by the way."
4791440,4795440," It's really common for me to not read any shit and then get angry about it."
4795440,4796440," But this is because I'm streaming."
4796440,4797440," Okay."
4797440,4799440," So I have to have a sparse attention when I'm streaming."
4799440,4800440," So it's difficult."
4800440,4801440," Got me some slack."
4801440,4802440," Okay."
4802440,4807440," So anyway."
4807440,4808440," So this is what we're going to be using."
4808440,4809440," Right."
4809440,4810440," So this is what we're going to be using."
4810440,4813440," And let's just go ahead and iterate through all of the tokens."
4813440,4816440," So we have to provide the pointer to the Alexa."
4816440,4817440," All right."
4817440,4821440," And essentially while you have this kind of thing."
4821440,4828440," So we can just print all of these little cans."
4828440,4829440," Right."
4829440,4831440," So we're basically printing all of these little cans."
4831440,4832440," So we're going to be talking."
4832440,4833440," And that's it."
4833440,4836440," So let's see how many tokens we have."
4836440,4837440," It doesn't even."
4837440,4838440," Yeah."
4838440,4839440," It has to be just dot."
4839440,4840440," All right."
4840440,4842440," So did it work?"
4842440,4843440," Um."
4843440,4844440," Expected."
4844440,4845440," It's a long int."
4845440,4846440," LD."
4846440,4849440," And it actually didn't print shit."
4849440,4850440," Surprisingly."
4850440,4851440," All right."
4851440,4855440," So did it literally not print anything?"
4855440,4857440," That's very surprising."
4857440,4858440," Tokens."
4858440,4859440," I'm going to put it like that."
4859440,4860440," And."
4860440,4861440," Yeah."
4861440,4862440," So it's so it's sad."
4862440,4864440," It says that there is no tokens in here."
4864440,4865440," Very cool."
4865440,4866440," Thank you."
4866440,4871440," So I would expect it to at least like have something."
4871440,4872440," That's that's bizarre, man."
4872440,4873440," Right."
4873440,4874440," That's bizarre."
4874440,4875440," So."
4875440,4876440," Uh."
4876440,4878440," We're going to put like a new line in here."
4878440,4879440," Uh."
4879440,4880440," 256."
4880440,4881440," Right."
4881440,4882440," So why."
4882440,4883440," Um."
4883440,4887440," Function returns non-zero if token is parsed."
4887440,4889440," So the token was not parsed."
4889440,4890440," Uh."
4890440,4891440," You deleted."
4891440,4892440," Did I delete init?"
4892440,4893440," Oh, for fuck's sake."
4893440,4894440," How did that happen?"
4894440,4895440," Okay."
4895440,4896440," Let's go back."
4896440,4897440," Let's go back."
4897440,4897440," Oh."
4897440,4898440," All right."
4898440,4899440," All right."
4899440,4900440," Oof."
4900440,4901440," Right."
4901440,4905440," Let's pretend you didn't see that."
4905440,4906440," Okay."
4906440,4908440," So let's pretend you didn't see that."
4908440,4909440," Uh."
4909440,4910440," Let's go."
4910440,4911440," Motherfucker."
4911440,4912440," Let's go."
4912440,4913440," Goal."
4913440,4914440," Goal."
4914440,4915440," All right."
4915440,4917440," So that's pretty cool."
4917440,4918440," That's pretty cool."
4918440,4919440," Uh."
4919440,4920440," I suppose."
4920440,4921440," Uh."
4921440,4922440," 260."
4922440,4924440," So what's that?"
4924440,4925440," 260."
4925440,4927440," I suppose it's one of these things."
4927440,4928440," In."
4928440,4929440," Yeah."
4929440,4930440," Here."
4930440,4931440," Here they are."
4931440,4932440," I missed it."
4932440,4933440," Motherfucker."
4933440,4934440," Okay."
4934440,4935440," Klecks underscore."
4935440,4936440," I don't see it."
4936440,4937440," Uh."
4937440,4938440," Float."
4938440,4939440," Yeah."
4939440,4940440," Yeah."
4940440,4941440," Yeah."
4941440,4942440," These ones."
4942440,4943440," All right."
4943440,4944440," So."
4944440,4945440," That's the funny part."
4945440,4946440," So."
4946440,4947440," Everything that is bigger than 256."
4947440,4948440," Right."
4948440,4949440," Is either end of file."
4949440,4951440," Or one of these special things."
4951440,4952440," Right."
4952440,4953440," So."
4953440,4954440," If I remember correctly."
4954440,4955440," How to use this kind of thing."
4955440,4956440," What we can do is."
4956440,4957440," If."
4957440,4958440," L token."
4958440,4959440," Is less than 256."
4959440,4960440," Right."
4960440,4961440," So."
4961440,4962440," It's a single character."
4962440,4965440," And we can literally just print that character."
4965440,4966440," As a character."
4966440,4967440," Right."
4967440,4968440," Otherwise."
4968440,4969440," Otherwise."
4969440,4970440," We can just do."
4970440,4971440," Switch upon."
4971440,4972440," Those things."
4972440,4973440," Right."
4973440,4974440," So."
4974440,4975440," Um."
4975440,4976440," 60."
4976440,4977440," So."
4977440,4978440," 57."
4978440,4979440," 58."
4979440,4980440," 59."
4980440,4981440," 60."
4981440,4982440," So."
4982440,4983440," Uh."
4983440,4984440," That's what we can do."
4984440,4985440," If."
4985440,4986440," L."
4986440,4987440," L."
4987440,4988440," Token."
4988440,4990440," Is equal to that."
4990440,4991440," We can just say that."
4991440,4992440," This is."
4992440,4993440," CLEX."
4993440,4994440," ID."
4994440,4995440," This is CLEX."
4995440,4996440," ID."
4996440,4997440," Otherwise."
4997440,4998440," And."
4998440,4999440," Treating this entire thing."
4999440,5000440," As a long."
5000440,5001440," D."
5001440,5002440," Long."
5002440,5003440," D."
5003440,5004440," Long digit."
5004440,5005440," Or something."
5005440,5006440," I don't fucking know."
5006440,5007440," Uh."
5007440,5008440," Yeah."
5008440,5009440," There we go."
5009440,5010440," Uh."
5010440,5011440," All right."
5011440,5012440," So."
5012440,5013440," We have."
5013440,5014440," CLEX ID."
5014440,5015440," And."
5015440,5016440," For the CLEX ID."
5016440,5017440," If it is."
5017440,5018440," In fact."
5018440,5019440," CLEX ID."
5019440,5020440," It is relatively easy to."
5020440,5021440," Even print it."
5021440,5022440," Right."
5022440,5023440," So."
5023440,5024440," Essentially."
5024440,5025440," Get."
5025440,5026440," Token."
5026440,5027440," Right."
5027440,5028440," So."
5028440,5029440," Let's find the documentation."
5029440,5030440," If it's."
5030440,5031440," Uh."
5031440,5032440," Basically."
5032440,5033440," CLEX identifier."
5033440,5034440," Right."
5034440,5035440," So."
5035440,5036440," That means."
5036440,5037440," It is."
5037440,5038440," Uh huh."
5038440,5039440," Pretty cool."
5039440,5040440," Um."
5040440,5041440," It's a byte length."
5041440,5042440," So."
5042440,5043440," All of that is an ultimate."
5043440,5044440," Okay."
5044440,5045440," That's cool."
5045440,5046440," So."
5046440,5047440," String."
5047440,5048440," Uh huh."
5048440,5049440," Uh huh."
5049440,5050440," And."
5050440,5051440," We can just do it like that."
5051440,5052440," So."
5052440,5053440," We can just say."
5053440,5054440," CLEX ID."
5054440,5055440," Uh huh."
5055440,5056440," So."
5056440,5057440," All right."
5057440,5058440," Look at that."
5058440,5059440," Look at that."
5059440,5060440," It works."
5060440,5061440," It."
5061440,5062440," Motherflipping works."
5062440,5063440," So."
5063440,5064440," What is."
5064440,5065440," 161."
5065440,5066440," So."
5066440,5067440," 161."
5067440,5068440," CLEX ID."
5068440,5069440," If I remember correctly."
5069440,5070440," Right."
5070440,5071440," So."
5071440,5072440," CLEX ID."
5072440,5073440," Uh huh."
5073440,5074440," So."
5074440,5075440," What is it."
5075440,5076440," What was the."
5076440,5077440," I don't remember."
5077440,5078440," Honestly."
5078440,5080440," What was the name."
5080440,5081440," Of the thing."
5081440,5082440," Okay."
5082440,5083440," So."
5083440,5084440," It's enumeration."
5084440,5085440," It doesn't even have a proper name."
5085440,5086440," Okay."
5086440,5087440," So."
5087440,5088440," DIG string."
5088440,5089440," Um."
5089440,5089440," I suppose."
5089440,5091440," It's like a double quoted string."
5091440,5092440," Or whatever."
5092440,5092440," Uh."
5092440,5093440," All right."
5093440,5093440," So."
5093440,5094440," We can work with that."
5094440,5095440," I suppose."
5095440,5096440," Um."
5096440,5097440," Right."
5097440,5098440," Else."
5098440,5099440," If."
5099440,5100440," El."
5100440,5101440," El token."
5101440,5102440," El token."
5102440,5102440," Uh."
5102440,5103440," We can just do it like that."
5103440,5103440," So."
5103440,5104440," It's going to be."
5104440,5105440," DIG string."
5105440,5106440," And."
5106440,5107440," But here."
5107440,5108440," We're going to actually wrap it."
5108440,5109440," I suppose."
5109440,5110440," In."
5110440,5111440," Parentheses like that."
5111440,5112440," Does it handle the escaping."
5112440,5113440," And shit."
5113440,5115440," Does it handle the escaping."
5115440,5116440," We're about to find out."
5116440,5117440," Honestly."
5117440,5118440," Uh."
5118440,5119440," We're about to find out."
5119440,5120440," Show me the."
5120440,5121440," Aha."
5121440,5123440," It does handle the escaping."
5123440,5124440," Okay."
5124440,5125440," All right."
5125440,5126440," As you can see."
5126440,5127440," I just had a new line."
5127440,5129440," And it transformed the new line."
5129440,5130440," Into this kind of thing."
5130440,5131440," Can I just ask."
5131440,5132440," This entire thing."
5132440,5134440," To not do escaping."
5134440,5136440," Can I just ask it."
5136440,5137440," To not do it."
5137440,5138440," That's a good question."
5138440,5139440," Honestly."
5139440,5140440," That's a good question."
5140440,5141440," Okay."
5141440,5142440," So."
5142440,5143440," What is."
5143440,5144440," 258."
5144440,5145440," So."
5145440,5146440," I suppose."
5146440,5147440," It's some sort of a number."
5147440,5148440," Right."
5148440,5149440," So."
5149440,5150440," ID."
5150440,5151440," 59."
5151440,5152440," It's a."
5152440,5153440," Int lit."
5153440,5154440," Okay."
5154440,5155440," So."
5155440,5156440," This is a."
5156440,5157440," Int lit."
5157440,5158440," Honestly."
5158440,5159440," Think."
5159440,5160440," I think here."
5160440,5161440," We could actually start doing."
5161440,5162440," This switch case."
5162440,5163440," Right."
5163440,5164440," So."
5164440,5165440," Some sort of a switch case."
5165440,5166440," Maybe we can."
5166440,5167440," Transform all of these things."
5167440,5168440," Into switch case."
5168440,5169440," We'll see."
5169440,5169440," We'll see."
5169440,5170440," We'll see."
5170440,5171440," And."
5171440,5172440," Let's."
5172440,5173440," Transform."
5173440,5174440," This entire thing."
5174440,5175440," Like."
5175440,5176440," So."
5176440,5177440," This is just the case."
5177440,5178440," Collect."
5178440,5179440," ID."
5179440,5180440," Like."
5180440,5181440," So."
5181440,5182440," And here."
5182440,5183440," We're going to just do the break."
5183440,5184440," Here."
5184440,5185440," Is."
5185440,5186440," Another case."
5186440,5187440," This is going to be just the break."
5187440,5187440," Just a break."
5187440,5188440," Just a break."
5188440,5189440," Just a break."
5189440,5190440," Just a break."
5190440,5191440," Just a break."
5191440,5192440," Just a break."
5192440,5193440," All right."
5193440,5194440," So."
5194440,5195440," Cool."
5195440,5196440," And to be fair."
5196440,5197440," Maybe."
5197440,5198440," Maybe."
5198440,5199440," Maybe."
5199440,5200440," We can."
5200440,5201440," We can even take."
5201440,5202440," This."
5202440,5203440," Le condition."
5203440,5204440," Le condition."
5204440,5205440," And just put it in here."
5205440,5206440," Like that."
5206440,5207440," Then."
5207440,5208440," Go."
5208440,5209440," In here."
5209440,5210440," Like so."
5210440,5211440," And just do."
5211440,5212440," Else."
5212440,5213440," Look."
5213440,5214440," We only have the switch case."
5214440,5215440," Isn't that."
5215440,5216440," Cool."
5216440,5219440," I think that's so freaking cool mate."
5219440,5220440," Uh huh."
5220440,5221440," So."
5221440,5222440," We need to introduce the case."
5222440,5223440," Clax."
5223440,5224440," Int."
5224440,5225440," Lit."
5225440,5226440," All right."
5226440,5226440," So."
5226440,5228440," This is going to be break."
5228440,5229440," And."
5229440,5230440," In case of int."
5230440,5231440," Lit."
5231440,5232440," All right."
5232440,5233440," Get token."
5233440,5234440," Mm-hmm."
5234440,5238440," Int number."
5238440,5239440," So."
5239440,5240440," Int number."
5240440,5241440," Is this thing."
5241440,5242440," Okay."
5242440,5244440," That makes a lot of sense."
5244440,5245440," Uh huh."
5245440,5246440," Int lit."
5246440,5247440," So."
5247440,5248440," This is."
5248440,5249440," Int lit."
5249440,5250440," We put this thing in here."
5250440,5251440," And."
5251440,5252440," We just."
5252440,5253440," Run it like this."
5253440,5254440," Okay."
5254440,5255440," That is very cool."
5255440,5256440," Uh."
5256440,5257440," That is very cool."
5257440,5258440," And."
5258440,5259440," Does it work?"
5259440,5260440," Okay."
5260440,5261440," So."
5261440,5262440," That's."
5262440,5263440," And then."
5263440,5264440," Then it's sick faulted."
5264440,5265440," It."
5265440,5266440," Did it really just sick fault on me?"
5266440,5267440," The."
5267440,5268440," Fuck."
5268440,5269440," Can't believe you just sick faulted on me."
5269440,5270440," How did it sick fault?"
5270440,5271440," So."
5271440,5272440," Oh."
5272440,5273440," It's because of the ass."
5273440,5274440," I see."
5274440,5275440," It's because of the ass."
5275440,5276440," But now."
5276440,5277440," It works."
5277440,5278440," Look at that."
5278440,5279440," Yo."
5279440,5280440," Motherfucking."
5280440,5281440," Yo."
5281440,5282440," So."
5282440,5283440," What are the other things?"
5283440,5284440," So."
5284440,5285440," 264."
5285440,5286440," 264."
5286440,5287440," 261."
5287440,5288440," 2."
5288440,5289440," 3."
5289440,5290440," 4."
5290440,5291440," So."
5291440,5292440," It's equals."
5292440,5293440," Okay."
5293440,5294440," When we have equals."
5294440,5295440," Let's just like."
5295440,5296440," Use the string."
5296440,5297440," Or."
5297440,5298440," Do we have to do something special?"
5298440,5299440," Uh."
5299440,5300440," Oh."
5300440,5302440," You can just print the token."
5302440,5303440," Yeah."
5303440,5304440," You can just print the token."
5304440,5305440," And it's printed to."
5305440,5306440," F."
5306440,5307440," Huh."
5307440,5308440," Yeah."
5308440,5311440," It just prints it."
5311440,5312440," And."
5312440,5313440," But it doesn't really."
5313440,5314440," Um."
5314440,5315440," How is it called?"
5315440,5316440," Unescape it."
5316440,5317440," Right."
5317440,5318440," So."
5318440,5319440," Let's actually try to."
5319440,5320440," Do the print."
5320440,5321440," Talking thing."
5321440,5322440," Um."
5322440,5323440," I will still need."
5323440,5324440," This entire thing."
5324440,5325440," Right."
5325440,5326440," Because we're gonna be."
5326440,5327440," Actually."
5327440,5328440," Adjusting stuff."
5328440,5329440," And everything."
5329440,5330440," Uh."
5330440,5331440," Right."
5331440,5332440," But."
5332440,5333440," I just wanna see."
5333440,5334440," If it's going to work."
5334440,5335440," Like that."
5335440,5336440," So."
5336440,5337440," Uh."
5337440,5338440," The token."
5338440,5339440," Oh."
5339440,5340440," By the way."
5340440,5341440," It's a static."
5341440,5342440," It's probably not gonna be."
5342440,5343440," Even visible."
5343440,5344440," Damn."
5344440,5345440," It's actually."
5345440,5346440," Yeah."
5346440,5347440," Just like."
5347440,5348440," Um."
5348440,5349440," But you can actually."
5349440,5350440," Do the test."
5350440,5351440," Uh."
5351440,5352440," Think."
5352440,5353440," I think."
5353440,5354440," That's one of the things."
5354440,5355440," You can do."
5355440,5356440," Right."
5356440,5357440," So."
5357440,5358440," It's behind."
5358440,5359440," This macro."
5359440,5360440," Uh huh."
5360440,5361440," And."
5361440,5362440," Redefinition."
5362440,5363440," Oh."
5363440,5364440," There is a redefinition."
5364440,5365440," If you enable the tests."
5365440,5366440," It."
5366440,5367440," It creates it."
5367440,5368440," So."
5368440,5369440," Oh my."
5369440,5370440," God."
5370440,5371440," Bro."
5371440,5372440," Uh."
5372440,5373440," I see."
5373440,5374440," Uh."
5374440,5376440," All right."
5376440,5377440," So."
5377440,5378440," It would be kind of nice."
5378440,5379440," If you just."
5379440,5380440," Exposed this thing."
5380440,5381440," It's just like."
5381440,5382440," Bruh."
5382440,5383440," Bruh."
5383440,5384440," Bruh."
5384440,5385440," Bruh."
5385440,5386440," Bruh."
5386440,5387440," Bruh."
5387440,5388440," Bruh."
5388440,5390440," You know what."
5390440,5391440," I think."
5391440,5393440," I can just put it in here."
5393440,5394440," And just."
5394440,5395440," Make it."
5395440,5396440," Make it not static."
5396440,5397440," And."
5397440,5398440," Uh."
5398440,5399440," Yeah."
5399440,5400440," You're not going to stop me."
5400440,5402440," You're not going to fucking stop me."
5402440,5403440," What you're going to do."
5403440,5405440," I have the source code."
5405440,5407440," I have the source code."
5407440,5408440," End of those."
5408440,5409440," So that seems to be."
5409440,5410440," Kind of."
5410440,5411440," Yeah."
5411440,5412440," It doesn't print the new line though."
5412440,5413440," Right."
5413440,5414440," It doesn't print the new line."
5414440,5415440," So."
5415440,5416440," One of the things we'll have to do in here."
5416440,5417440," Afterwards."
5417440,5418440," Is."
5418440,5419440," Just doing something like that."
5419440,5420440," Just doing something like that."
5420440,5421440," There we go."
5421440,5426440," It doesn't even print them correctly."
5426440,5427440," Honestly."
5427440,5428440," It's just like."
5428440,5429440," Yeah."
5429440,5430440," Yeah."
5430440,5431440," Makes sense."
5431440,5432440," There."
5432440,5433440," Yeah."
5433440,5434440," They're not even correct."
5434440,5436440," I was hoping that it's going to print the correct tokens."
5436440,5437440," That we can."
5437440,5438440," Then."
5438440,5439440," Assemble."
5439440,5440440," Back."
5440440,5441440," Into."
5441440,5442440," Compilable."
5442440,5443440," Program."
5443440,5444440," But it doesn't really do that."
5444440,5445440," So."
5445440,5446440," It doesn't really do that."
5446440,5447440," So that function was kind of useless."
5447440,5448440," Honestly."
5448440,5449440," That function was kind of useless."
5449440,5450440," But."
5450440,5451440," Anyways."
5451440,5452440," So."
5452440,5453440," What else do we have in here?"
5453440,5454440," So we have some things like."
5454440,5455440," Integers."
5455440,5456440," And what not."
5456440,5457440," So."
5457440,5458440," Two handed."
5458440,5459440," Seventy two."
5459440,5460440," Right."
5460440,5461440," So."
5461440,5462440," And the question is."
5462440,5463440," What is."
5463440,5464440," Seventy two."
5464440,5465440," Seventy two."
5465440,5466440," Seventy two."
5466440,5467440," Seventy two."
5467440,5468440," So maybe we can take a look."
5468440,5469440," At the."
5469440,5470440," It's probably."
5470440,5471440," Uh."
5471440,5472440," So there was."
5472440,5473440," Less than."
5473440,5474440," Sixteen."
5474440,5475440," So."
5475440,5476440," Cx."
5476440,5477440," Less than."
5477440,5478440," Sixteen."
5478440,5479440," And."
5479440,5480440," Let me."
5480440,5481440," Seventy two."
5481440,5482440," Uh huh."
5482440,5483440," Cx."
5483440,5484440," Less than."
5484440,5485440," Sixteen."
5485440,5486440," Semicolon."
5486440,5487440," Plus."
5487440,5488440," Plus."
5488440,5489440," Plus."
5489440,5490440," Mm hmm."
5490440,5491440," That's what it is."
5491440,5492440," It's actually."
5492440,5493440," Plus."
5493440,5494440," Plus."
5494440,5495440," So there is."
5495440,5496440," Things like."
5496440,5497440," Equals."
5497440,5498440," Plus."
5498440,5499440," Plus."
5499440,5500440," And so on."
5500440,5501440," And so forth."
5501440,5502440," The."
5502440,5503440," The."
5503440,5504440," There was."
5504440,5505440," Like."
5505440,5506440," Equals."
5506440,5507440," Equals."
5507440,5508440," Equals."
5508440,5509440," Damn."
5509440,5510440," I think."
5510440,5511440," I need to make a small break chat."
5511440,5513440," I really need to make a small break."
5513440,5514440," Uh."
5514440,5515440," Because I need to refill my tea."
5515440,5516440," Uh."
5516440,5517440," So."
5517440,5518440," And after the break."
5518440,5519440," Doing that."
5519440,5520440," We're actually getting super close."
5520440,5521440," Right."
5521440,5522440," So we already can."
5522440,5523440," Distinguish the tokens."
5523440,5524440," It's just like."
5524440,5525440," We need to."
5525440,5526440," Basically figure out."
5526440,5527440," All the kinds of tokens."
5527440,5528440," We have in here."
5528440,5529440," All the kinds of tokens."
5529440,5530440," We have in here."
5530440,5531440," And."
5531440,5532440," Start."
5532440,5533440," Like."
5533440,5534440," Writing the algorithm."
5534440,5535440," To adjust things."
5535440,5536440," And."
5536440,5537440," Um."
5537440,5538440," Okay."
5538440,5539440," So."
5539440,5540440," Um."
5540440,5541440," On the break."
5541440,5542440," We actually discussed it a little bit."
5542440,5543440," And."
5543440,5544440," It's kind of."
5544440,5545440," Like."
5545440,5546440," Messing with all of these."
5546440,5547440," Switch cases."
5547440,5548440," And tokens."
5548440,5549440," And stuff like that."
5549440,5550440," It's kind of a."
5550440,5551440," Dead end."
5551440,5552440," Right."
5552440,5553440," So."
5553440,5554440," It's too much effort."
5554440,5555440," So."
5555440,5556440," What we're noticed."
5556440,5557440," Is that."
5557440,5558440," There is these two pointers."
5558440,5559440," Within the."
5559440,5560440," Lexa."
5560440,5561440," Definition."
5561440,5562440," Right."
5562440,5563440," So."
5563440,5564440," Maybe."
5564440,5565440," Those are going to be useful."
5565440,5566440," For error messages."
5566440,5567440," We can."
5567440,5568440," Grab the actual."
5568440,5569440," Uh."
5569440,5570440," Representation of the characters."
5570440,5571440," Out of them."
5571440,5572440," Hopefully."
5572440,5573440," Let's actually see."
5573440,5574440," Um."
5574440,5575440," Right."
5575440,5576440," And I wonder."
5576440,5577440," If we can."
5577440,5578440," Like."
5578440,5579440," Just use them directly."
5579440,5580440," So."
5580440,5581440," I'm going to."
5581440,5582440," Disable this entire thing."
5582440,5583440," And."
5583440,5584440," I'm going to just."
5584440,5585440," Try to."
5585440,5586440," Take the first character."
5586440,5587440," So."
5587440,5588440," We can use that."
5588440,5589440," As a pointer."
5589440,5590440," To the."
5590440,5591440," To the string."
5591440,5592440," Of the token."
5592440,5593440," Right."
5593440,5594440," So."
5594440,5595440," Size string."
5595440,5596440," And you can."
5596440,5597440," Do size string."
5597440,5598440," With print tab."
5598440,5599440," Is."
5599440,5600440," If you do something."
5600440,5601440," Like this."
5601440,5602440," If I'm not mistaken."
5602440,5603440," Right."
5603440,5604440," So."
5604440,5605440," And you'll have to."
5605440,5606440," Provide the size in here."
5606440,5607440," So."
5607440,5608440," I suppose."
5608440,5609440," The way we can."
5609440,5610440," Do that."
5610440,5611440," Is."
5611440,5612440," By taking the last character."
5612440,5613440," pointer."
5613440,5613440," And I think."
5613440,5614440," That will."
5614440,5615440," Do the trick."
5615440,5615440," Hopefully."
5615440,5616440," We can even."
5616440,5617440," Put the."
5617440,5618440," You know."
5618440,5619440," Identifier."
5619440,5619440," Of the."
5619440,5620440," Of the token."
5620440,5621440," In here."
5621440,5622440," Like."
5622440,5623440," L token."
5623440,5624440," It's supposed to be."
5624440,5625440," LD."
5625440,5626440," Long D."
5626440,5627440," That's what it's supposed to be."
5627440,5628440," And if I remember correctly."
5628440,5629440," This thing."
5629440,5630440," Has to be an integer."
5630440,5631440," Right."
5631440,5632440," So it doesn't."
5632440,5633440," You know."
5633440,5634440," Accept."
5634440,5635440," Between the pointers."
5635440,5636440," Is actually."
5636440,5637440," Signed."
5637440,5638440," Integer."
5638440,5639440," Actually."
5639440,5640440," Because you can actually."
5640440,5641440," Subtract."
5641440,5642440," A bigger pointer."
5642440,5643440," From a smaller one."
5643440,5644440," And you end up."
5644440,5645440," With a negative number."
5645440,5646440," Because of that."
5646440,5647440," A pointer difference."
5647440,5648440," Is actually."
5648440,5649440," Signed one."
5649440,5650440," Alright."
5650440,5651440," So."
5651440,5652440," Let's actually."
5652440,5653440," Do the make."
5653440,5654440," And see."
5654440,5655440," If it's going to work."
5655440,5656440," It kind of worked."
5656440,5657440," But not really."
5657440,5658440," Yeah."
5658440,5659440," It actually."
5659440,5660440," Didn't work."
5660440,5661440," At all."
5661440,5662440," Surprisingly."
5662440,5663440," So."
5663440,5663440," Maybe."
5663440,5664440," This is something."
5664440,5665440," Maybe."
5665440,5666440," We have to compute."
5666440,5667440," Like."
5667440,5668440," Where do we do."
5668440,5669440," First."
5669440,5670440," Character."
5670440,5671440," So."
5671440,5672440," So."
5672440,5673440," This is."
5673440,5674440," Okay."
5674440,5675440," Huh."
5675440,5676440," Alright."
5676440,5677440," Alright."
5677440,5678440," Alright."
5678440,5679440," So."
5679440,5680440," Main helper function."
5680440,5681440," For returning."
5681440,5682440," A parsed."
5682440,5683440," Token."
5683440,5684440," So."
5684440,5685440," Where."
5685440,5686440," Is it."
5686440,5687440," Happening."
5687440,5688440," Uh huh."
5688440,5689440," Did I."
5689440,5690440," Do some."
5690440,5691440," Fucky."
5691440,5692440," Walky."
5692440,5693440," Honestly."
5693440,5694440," Code."
5694440,5695440," The amount."
5695440,5696440," Of characters."
5696440,5697440," In here."
5697440,5698440," For example."
5698440,5699440," I said."
5699440,5700440," I said."
5700440,5701440," That."
5701440,5702440," We're going to have."
5702440,5703440," Five characters."
5703440,5704440," In here."
5704440,5705440," All the time."
5705440,5706440," Is it."
5706440,5707440," Going to work."
5707440,5708440," For me."
5708440,5709440," Um."
5709440,5710440," Kind of did."
5710440,5711440," Right."
5711440,5712440," So."
5712440,5713440," Yeah."
5713440,5714440," So."
5714440,5715440," That means."
5715440,5716440," What."
5716440,5717440," If."
5717440,5718440," The last character."
5718440,5719440," Is not."
5719440,5720440," The character."
5720440,5721440," The last one."
5721440,5722440," So."
5722440,5723440," That means."
5723440,5724440," We have to."
5724440,5725440," Kind of."
5725440,5726440," Do."
5726440,5727440," Plus."
5727440,5728440," One."
5728440,5729440," For the entire thing."
5729440,5730440," Yeah."
5730440,5731440," That's basically."
5731440,5732440," What happened."
5732440,5733440," We had to do."
5733440,5734440," Plus."
5734440,5735440," One."
5735440,5736440," A."
5736440,5737440," All right."
5737440,5738440," So."
5738440,5739440," That's what it means."
5739440,5740440," To have an experience."
5740440,5741440," In software development."
5741440,5742440," Right."
5742440,5743440," So you can just like."
5743440,5744440," Follow your intuition."
5744440,5745440," Sometimes."
5745440,5746440," Yeah."
5746440,5747440," That's."
5747440,5748440," That's fair."
5748440,5749440," All right."
5749440,5750440," So I want."
5750440,5751440," To turn."
5751440,5752440," This entire thing."
5752440,5753440," Into."
5753440,5754440," Into."
5754440,5755440," Into this kind of stuff."
5755440,5756440," Right."
5756440,5756440," And."
5756440,5757440," What I want to do."
5757440,5758440," I want to."
5758440,5759440," Redirect."
5759440,5760440," This thing."
5760440,5761440," To."
5761440,5762440," Just basically."
5762440,5763440," Conway."
5763440,5764440," Test."
5764440,5765440," Dot."
5765440,5766440," C."
5766440,5767440," Right."
5767440,5768440," Conway."
5768440,5769440," Test."
5769440,5770440," That's."
5770440,5771440," So this is the source code you have."
5771440,5772440," Imagine that you've got."
5772440,5773440," This kind of source code."
5773440,5774440," Right."
5774440,5777440," It's just a string of tokens."
5777440,5778440," And."
5778440,5779440," This is a correct C program."
5779440,5780440," Right."
5780440,5781440," If you try to build it."
5781440,5782440," C."
5782440,5783440," C."
5783440,5784440," C."
5784440,5785440," O."
5785440,5786440," Conway."
5786440,5787440," Test."
5787440,5788440," C."
5788440,5789440," You don't have to put C in here."
5789440,5790440," It will compile."
5790440,5791440," It will compile."
5791440,5792440," Actually."
5792440,5793440," And then."
5793440,5794440," You can go ahead."
5794440,5795440," And run it."
5795440,5796440," Conway."
5796440,5797440," Test."
5797440,5798440," The test."
5798440,5799440," Right."
5799440,5800440," And."
5800440,5801440," As you can see."
5801440,5802440," It works."
5802440,5803440," So."
5803440,5804440," C code."
5804440,5805440," So."
5805440,5806440," This is absolutely valid."
5806440,5807440," C code."
5807440,5808440," It's just like."
5808440,5809440," How exactly."
5809440,5810440," You."
5810440,5811440," Going to arrange it."
5811440,5812440," Into."
5812440,5813440," Into."
5813440,5814440," Ascii art."
5814440,5815440," Is kind of up to you."
5815440,5816440," Right."
5816440,5817440," So."
5817440,5818440," We need to kind of prepare."
5818440,5819440," The ascii art."
5819440,5820440," To be fair."
5820440,5821440," It's actually super easy."
5821440,5822440," To."
5822440,5823440," To generate such art."
5823440,5825440," Imagine that you have a monochrome image."
5825440,5826440," Right."
5826440,5827440," You loaded monochrome image."
5827440,5828440," In the."
5828440,5829440," In the memory."
5829440,5831440," And you just iterate."
5831440,5832440," Yeah."
5832440,5833440," Let me actually."
5833440,5834440," Show you what I mean."
5834440,5834440," So."
5834440,5835440," I think it would make sense to."
5835440,5836440," Draw what I mean."
5836440,5837440," Um."
5837440,5838440," So."
5838440,5839440," Imagine."
5839440,5840440," That."
5840440,5841440," So."
5841440,5842440," Imagine."
5842440,5843440," That you."
5843440,5844440," Have."
5844440,5845440," The glider."
5845440,5846440," Right."
5846440,5847440," I."
5847440,5848440," I."
5848440,5849440," I feel like."
5849440,5850440," Generating."
5850440,5851440," An."
5851440,5852440," Ascii image."
5852440,5853440," Like that."
5853440,5854440," Is."
5854440,5855440," Actually."
5855440,5856440," Rather trivial."
5856440,5857440," Like."
5857440,5858440," I do."
5858440,5859440," In fact."
5859440,5860440," Believe that."
5860440,5861440," So."
5861440,5862440," Imagine that you have."
5862440,5863440," This kind of thing."
5863440,5864440," And."
5864440,5865440," Each."
5865440,5866440," Cell."
5866440,5867440," Is actually."
5867440,5868440," Several of them."
5868440,5869440," Maybe."
5869440,5870440," I don't know."
5870440,5871440," Five by five."
5871440,5872440," Or something."
5872440,5873440," So."
5873440,5874440," And."
5874440,5875440," You."
5875440,5875440," Have."
5875440,5876440," Spaces."
5876440,5876440," And."
5876440,5877440," This is."
5877440,5878440," Actual."
5878440,5879440," Pixels."
5879440,5880440," And."
5880440,5881440," So on."
5881440,5882440," And so forth."
5882440,5883440," Right."
5883440,5884440," What you do."
5884440,5885440," You just iterate."
5885440,5886440," From left."
5886440,5887440," To right."
5887440,5888440," Top."
5888440,5889440," Or."
5889440,5890440," Top down."
5890440,5891440," Very simple thing."
5891440,5892440," You encounter."
5892440,5893440," The background pixel."
5893440,5894440," Print space."
5894440,5895440," Background pixel."
5895440,5896440," Print space."
5896440,5897440," And so on."
5897440,5898440," And so forth."
5898440,5899440," Until you encounter."
5899440,5900440," Foreground pixel."
5900440,5901440," Now."
5901440,5902440," You maintain."
5902440,5903440," A list."
5903440,5904440," Of tokens."
5904440,5905440," Token one."
5905440,5906440," Token two."
5906440,5907440," And this is the tokens."
5907440,5908440," Of your program."
5908440,5909440," And you have a pointer."
5909440,5910440," That points at the current."
5910440,5911440," Okay."
5911440,5912440," So."
5912440,5913440," You."
5913440,5914440," Print the token."
5914440,5915440," You print."
5915440,5916440," The token."
5916440,5917440," And you take the length."
5917440,5918440," Of the token."
5918440,5919440," And you actually."
5919440,5920440," Advance."
5920440,5921440," Your horizontal."
5921440,5922440," Cursor."
5922440,5923440," Cursor."
5923440,5924440," By the length."
5924440,5925440," Of the token."
5925440,5926440," Like so."
5926440,5927440," And you continue."
5927440,5928440," Repeat this algorithm."
5928440,5929440," You encounter."
5929440,5930440," Foreground."
5930440,5931440," Advance."
5931440,5932440," To the next token."
5932440,5933440," And so on."
5933440,5934440," And so forth."
5934440,5935440," You print."
5935440,5936440," The next token."
5936440,5937440," And the next token."
5937440,5938440," That implies."
5938440,5939440," By the way."
5939440,5940440," That you can."
5940440,5941440," Overshoot."
5941440,5942440," A little bit."
5942440,5943440," Sometimes."
5943440,5944440," And we're going to declare."
5944440,5945440," All of that stuff."
5945440,5946440," All of the."
5946440,5947440," Overshooting."
5947440,5948440," It's going to happen."
5948440,5949440," It's going to happen."
5949440,5950440," And maybe some of it."
5950440,5951440," Can be adjusted manually."
5951440,5952440," Our goal."
5952440,5953440," Is to not."
5953440,5954440," Not to write a program."
5954440,5955440," That intelligently."
5955440,5956440," Makes it perfect."
5956440,5958440," That's not our goal."
5958440,5959440," Our goal."
5959440,5960440," Is to roughly."
5960440,5961440," Put things."
5961440,5962440," Into the shape."
5962440,5963440," That we want."
5963440,5964440," And then."
5964440,5965440," We can."
5965440,5966440," Refine."
5966440,5967440," These shapes."
5967440,5968440," Manually."
5968440,5969440," It's like."
5969440,5970440," AI art."
5970440,5971440," Right."
5971440,5972440," You ask it."
5972440,5973440," You something."
5973440,5973440," And then."
5973440,5974440," You adjust it."
5974440,5975440," In Photoshop."
5975440,5976440," Right."
5976440,5977440," So."
5977440,5978440," That's how."
5978440,5979440," We're going to be doing."
5979440,5980440," So."
5980440,5981440," Basically."
5981440,5982440," Making."
5982440,5983440," An AI model."
5983440,5984440," We could minimize."
5984440,5985440," Identifiers."
5985440,5986440," That are too long."
5986440,5987440," Yeah."
5987440,5988440," So."
5988440,5989440," You can actually."
5989440,5990440," You can actually."
5990440,5991440," Get really."
5991440,5992440," Nerd snapped."
5992440,5993440," By this."
5993440,5994440," Like super hard."
5994440,5995440," You can."
5995440,5996440," Implement."
5996440,5997440," Some sort of."
5997440,5998440," Intelligence."
5998440,5999440," System."
5999440,6000440," That splits."
6000440,6001440," The string."
6001440,6002440," You can."
6002440,6003440," Identify."
6003440,6004440," Variables."
6004440,6004440," And."
6004440,6005440," Change."
6005440,6006440," The variables."
6006440,6007440," Names."
6007440,6008440," Automatically."
6008440,6009440," In all the places."
6009440,6010440," To fit things."
6010440,6011440," Accordingly."
6011440,6012440," You can."
6012440,6013440," Try to solve."
6013440,6014440," Some sort of."
6014440,6015440," Like."
6015440,6016440," A knack sack."
6016440,6017440," Problem."
6017440,6018440," Or whatever."
6018440,6019440," So."
6019440,6020440," Yeah."
6020440,6021440," So."
6021440,6022440," You can actually."
6022440,6022440," Do dynamic."
6022440,6023440," Programming."
6023440,6024440," Of some sort."
6024440,6024440," All right."
6024440,6025440," So."
6025440,6026440," If you have."
6026440,6027440," Like."
6027440,6028440," A way."
6028440,6029440," To modify."
6029440,6030440," Variable."
6030440,6031440," Names."
6031440,6032440," But."
6032440,6033440," You need."
6033440,6034440," To."
6034440,6035440," Write."
6035440,6036440," The variable."
6036440,6037440," Declaration."
6037440,6038440," And this is."
6038440,6039440," Where we use."
6039440,6040440," Those variables."
6040440,6041440," So if I change."
6041440,6042440," The name."
6042440,6043440," Of that variable."
6043440,6044440," I have to update it."
6044440,6045440," On all the places."
6045440,6046440," That it's used."
6046440,6047440," Which automatically."
6047440,6048440," Modifies."
6048440,6049440," Go into a huge."
6049440,6050440," Rabbit hole."
6050440,6051440," In here."
6051440,6052440," So there is."
6052440,6053440," A lot of."
6053440,6054440," Like."
6054440,6055440," Depth."
6055440,6056440," Into this."
6056440,6057440," Rabbit hole."
6057440,6058440," If you want to."
6058440,6059440," I personally."
6059440,6060440," Don't want to."
6060440,6061440," Write."
6061440,6062440," But you."
6062440,6063440," You can do."
6063440,6064440," A lot of interesting."
6064440,6065440," Things."
6065440,6066440," So anyway."
6066440,6067440," Yeah."
6067440,6068440," So that's basically."
6068440,6069440," The algorithm."
6069440,6070440," That I have."
6070440,6071440," In my mind."
6071440,6072440," Right."
6072440,6073440," Yeah."
6073440,6074440," This is why."
6074440,6075440," The macros."
6075440,6076440," Break everything."
6076440,6077440," That's true."
6077440,6078440," A lot of."
6078440,6079440," Other examples."
6079440,6080440," In here."
6080440,6081440," Like a donut."
6081440,6082440," And the."
6082440,6083440," Pocket GB."
6083440,6084440," Right."
6084440,6085440," They also don't have."
6085440,6086440," Any preprocessors."
6086440,6087440," So there is."
6087440,6088440," Honestly."
6088440,6089440," There is a little bit."
6089440,6090440," Okay."
6090440,6091440," That is."
6091440,6092440," Cool."
6092440,6093440," This person."
6093440,6094440," Managed."
6094440,6095440," Okay."
6095440,6096440," Managed."
6096440,6097440," To incorporate."
6097440,6098440," Even includes."
6098440,6099440," In."
6099440,6100440," That is actually."
6100440,6101440," Way cooler."
6101440,6102440," Honestly."
6102440,6103440," That is actually."
6103440,6104440," Way cooler."
6104440,6105440," Way cooler."
6105440,6106440," Yeah."
6106440,6107440," So."
6107440,6108440," Yeah."
6108440,6109440," They have a thing."
6109440,6110440," That is macro aware."
6110440,6111440," A preprocessor aware."
6111440,6112440," All right."
6112440,6113440," That."
6113440,6114440," That deserves respect."
6114440,6115440," That deserves respect."
6115440,6116440," Cool."
6116440,6117440," Cool."
6117440,6118440," Cool."
6118440,6119440," Cool."
6119440,6120440," Anyways."
6120440,6121440," So."
6121440,6122440," What do we have?"
6122440,6123440," What do we have?"
6123440,6124440," So."
6124440,6125440," Let's actually draw."
6125440,6126440," Canways."
6126440,6127440," You know."
6127440,6128440," Glider."
6128440,6129440," Link to that."
6129440,6130440," Sure."
6130440,6131440," I actually."
6131440,6132440," Shared it."
6132440,6133440," At the beginning of the stream."
6133440,6134440," But I mean."
6134440,6135440," I can share it."
6135440,6136440," One more time."
6136440,6137440," And also."
6137440,6138440," For people who are watching."
6138440,6139440," On YouTube."
6139440,6140440," It's going to be in the description."
6140440,6141440," All right."
6141440,6142440," So."
6142440,6143440," Let me."
6143440,6143440," Create."
6143440,6144440," Maybe."
6144440,6145440," I think."
6145440,6146440," Let's create."
6146440,6147440," Three by three."
6147440,6148440," Right."
6148440,6148440," So."
6148440,6149440," I just want to draw."
6149440,6150440," A glider."
6150440,6151440," A three by three glider."
6151440,6151440," And then."
6151440,6152440," We're going to try to."
6152440,6153440," You know."
6153440,6154440," Scale it up."
6154440,6155440," Right."
6155440,6156440," Oh."
6156440,6157440," Pixels."
6157440,6158440," That's cool."
6158440,6159440," So."
6159440,6160440," Do we have."
6160440,6161440," Pixel art."
6161440,6162440," Okay."
6162440,6162440," So."
6162440,6163440," We have."
6163440,6164440," Things for pixel art."
6164440,6165440," That's cool."
6165440,6166440," Uh huh."
6166440,6167440," So."
6167440,6168440," That is epic."
6168440,6169440," So."
6169440,6170440," Then."
6170440,6171440," I should be able to."
6171440,6172440," Scale image."
6172440,6173440," To new size."
6173440,6174440," So."
6174440,6175440," Is there any way."
6175440,6176440," Uh."
6176440,6177440," Nearest neighbor."
6177440,6178440," Okay."
6178440,6179440," So."
6179440,6180440," We're going to be doing."
6180440,6181440," Nearest neighbor."
6181440,6182440," And."
6182440,6183440," I want to."
6183440,6184440," Just basically."
6184440,6185440," Multiply."
6185440,6186440," Uh."
6186440,6186440," And."
6186440,6187440," What the fuck."
6187440,6188440," Is the."
6188440,6189440," How."
6189440,6190440," I'm sorry."
6190440,6191440," I'm an idiot."
6191440,6192440," My brain."
6192440,6193440," My brain."
6193440,6194440," Automatically."
6194440,6195440," For some reason."
6195440,6196440," Thought that the black."
6196440,6197440," Is a foreground."
6197440,6198440," Okay."
6198440,6199440," It's a background."
6199440,6200440," I'm sorry."
6200440,6201440," So."
6201440,6202440," Yeah."
6202440,6203440," That's cool."
6203440,6204440," So now."
6204440,6205440," It's 15 by 15."
6205440,6206440," Maybe."
6206440,6207440," Honestly."
6207440,6208440," I would like to make it."
6208440,6209440," Because I want it."
6209440,6210440," Like 32 by 32."
6210440,6211440," Or something."
6211440,6212440," All of that."
6212440,6213440," Honestly."
6213440,6214440," Very easily."
6214440,6215440," Or maybe."
6215440,6216440," It could be adjusted."
6216440,6217440," Automatically."
6217440,6218440," But."
6218440,6219440," Uh."
6219440,6220440," Doesn't matter."
6220440,6221440," Um."
6221440,6222440," So."
6222440,6223440," I'm thinking."
6223440,6224440," Can we."
6224440,6225440," Do."
6225440,6226440," A little bit."
6226440,6227440," Where we."
6227440,6228440," Actually."
6228440,6229440," Do."
6229440,6230440," Something."
6230440,6230440," Like."
6230440,6231440," That."
6231440,6232440," Mm-hmm."
6232440,6237440," Because."
6237440,6237440," We want."
6237440,6238440," To be able."
6238440,6239440," To see."
6239440,6240440," This thing."
6240440,6241440," Because."
6241440,6242440," Are they gonna."
6242440,6243440," Like."
6243440,6244440," How to say."
6244440,6245440," That."
6245440,6246440," Um."
6246440,6247440," What is the word."
6247440,6248440," Merge."
6248440,6249440," Together."
6249440,6250440," Not a particular."
6250440,6251440," Great thing."
6251440,6252440," In my opinion."
6252440,6253440," That is."
6253440,6254440," Much better."
6254440,6255440," Honestly."
6255440,6256440," That is."
6256440,6257440," Kind of."
6257440,6258440," Much better."
6258440,6259440," Right."
6259440,6260440," If we manage."
6260440,6261440," To."
6261440,6262440," Yeah."
6262440,6263440," Just."
6263440,6264440," Like."
6264440,6265440," Generally."
6265440,6266440," You know."
6266440,6267440," Um."
6267440,6268440," Mm-hmm."
6268440,6269440," Mm-hmm."
6269440,6270440," Mm-hmm."
6270440,6271440," Mm-hmm."
6271440,6272440," Mm-hmm."
6272440,6273440," Mm-hmm."
6273440,6274440," Mm-hmm."
6274440,6275440," Mm-hmm."
6275440,6276440," Mm-hmm."
6276440,6277440," Mm-hmm."
6277440,6278440," Okay."
6278440,6279440," So."
6279440,6280440," Is it really black?"
6280440,6281440," It's."
6281440,6282440," It's not a."
6282440,6283440," Really black."
6283440,6284440," Honestly."
6284440,6285440," Uh."
6285440,6286440," Can we."
6286440,6287440," It didn't even."
6287440,6288440," Oh my god."
6288440,6289440," So."
6289440,6290440," Is there some."
6290440,6291440," Threshold."
6291440,6292440," Uh."
6292440,6293440," Use."
6293440,6294440," Selection."
6294440,6295440," As a."
6295440,6296440," Boundary."
6296440,6297440," Now."
6297440,6298440," Okay."
6298440,6299440," So."
6299440,6300440," Did I fill all of them?"
6300440,6301440," I think."
6301440,6302440," I feel."
6302440,6303440," Filled."
6303440,6304440," All of them."
6304440,6305440," So."
6305440,6306440," This is a."
6306440,6307440," Black."
6307440,6308440," And white."
6308440,6309440," Okay."
6309440,6310440," Mm-hmm."
6310440,6311440," Mm-hmm."
6311440,6312440," Mm-hmm."
6312440,6313440," Mm-hmm."
6313440,6314440," So."
6314440,6315440," Grow."
6315440,6316440," Zero."
6316440,6318440," I don't see."
6318440,6319440," How to."
6319440,6320440," Disable."
6320440,6321440," All that."
6321440,6322440," But I think."
6322440,6323440," I actually."
6323440,6324440," Covered."
6324440,6325440," All the pixels."
6325440,6325440," In here."
6325440,6326440," Anyways."
6326440,6327440," Mm-hmm."
6327440,6328440," So."
6328440,6329440," This is a."
6329440,6330440," Glinder."
6330440,6331440," PNG."
6331440,6332440," And."
6332440,6333440," Let's go ahead."
6333440,6334440," And just."
6334440,6335440," Load them up."
6335440,6336440," Let's just."
6336440,6337440," Load them up."
6337440,6338440," So."
6338440,6339440," We don't need."
6339440,6340440," This kind of stuff."
6340440,6341440," Pop that."
6341440,6342440," Meet."
6342440,6343440," Pop that."
6343440,6344440," Meet."
6344440,6345440," We don't."
6345440,6346440," We want to actually."
6346440,6347440," Accept."
6347440,6348440," Input."
6348440,6349440," PNG."
6349440,6350440," But I mean."
6350440,6351440," It's not necessarily."
6351440,6352440," PNG."
6352440,6353440," It's like."
6353440,6354440," Any."
6354440,6355440," Any image in here."
6355440,6356440," So."
6356440,6357440," What do we need."
6357440,6358440," In here."
6358440,6359440," There's still."
6359440,6359440," Still."
6359440,6360440," A little bit."
6360440,6361440," Of the."
6361440,6362440," Stb."
6362440,6363440," Image."
6363440,6364440," Stuff."
6364440,6365440," I'm pretty sure."
6365440,6366440," About that."
6366440,6367440," So."
6367440,6368440," We have."
6368440,6369440," Stb."
6369440,6370440," We only need."
6370440,6371440," To read."
6371440,6372440," This thing."
6372440,6373440," So."
6373440,6374440," This is a."
6374440,6375440," Conway."
6375440,6376440," I'm going."
6376440,6377440," To just do."
6377440,6378440," Stb."
6378440,6379440," Image."
6379440,6380440," And this is."
6380440,6381440," Stb."
6381440,6382440," Image."
6382440,6383440," Let's go."
6383440,6384440," Uh huh."
6384440,6385440," So."
6385440,6386440," It's going to be."
6386440,6387440," Input."
6387440,6388440," PNG."
6388440,6389440," No."
6389440,6390440," That's fine."
6390440,6391440," That's fine."
6391440,6392440," That's fine."
6392440,6393440," And here."
6393440,6394440," If I do."
6394440,6395440," If."
6395440,6396440," Rgc."
6396440,6397440," Less."
6397440,6398440," Or equal."
6398440,6399440," Than."
6399440,6400440," Zero."
6400440,6401440," We're going to say."
6401440,6402440," That."
6402440,6403440," You didn't provide."
6403440,6404440," An image."
6404440,6405440," That image is provided."
6405440,6406440," And then."
6406440,6407440," In here."
6407440,6408440," We're going to do."
6408440,6409440," Input."
6409440,6410440," Image."
6410440,6411440," Image."
6411440,6412440," Path."
6412440,6413440," Right."
6413440,6414440," Like so."
6414440,6415440," So."
6415440,6415440," We."
6415440,6416440," Read the file."
6416440,6417440," We read the input."
6417440,6418440," Of this entire stuff."
6418440,6419440," But now."
6419440,6420440," We have to."
6420440,6421440," Actually."
6421440,6422440," Read."
6422440,6423440," The image."
6423440,6424440," Stb."
6424440,6425440," Image."
6425440,6426440," I think it's."
6426440,6427440," Stb."
6427440,6428440," I load."
6428440,6429440," Yeah."
6429440,6430440," There we go."
6430440,6431440," So."
6431440,6432440," That's what we have to do."
6432440,6433440," In here."
6433440,6434440," We're going to just provide."
6434440,6435440," The input."
6435440,6436440," Image."
6436440,6437440," Path."
6437440,6438440," Here."
6438440,6439440," We're going to have."
6439440,6440440," Image."
6440440,6441440," Width."
6441440,6441440," And."
6441440,6442440," Image."
6442440,6443440," Height."
6443440,6444440," Image."
6444440,6444440," Height."
6444440,6444440," So."
6444440,6445440," This is the amount of components."
6445440,6446440," I don't really care about it."
6446440,6447440," I'm going to put null in here."
6447440,6448440," I'm going to ask it to actually."
6448440,6450440," Convert it to four components."
6450440,6451440," So."
6451440,6452440," This one is pixels."
6452440,6452440," And."
6452440,6453440," I actually."
6453440,6454440," Actually want to."
6454440,6455440," View pixels as."
6455440,6456440," In 32."
6456440,6457440," So."
6457440,6458440," That's what I want to have in here."
6458440,6459440," Explicitly."
6459440,6460440," Cast."
6460440,6461440," This entire thing in here."
6461440,6461440," So."
6461440,6463440," We also need to do something like this."
6463440,6464440," So."
6464440,6465440," We have."
6465440,6466440," An access to."
6466440,6467440," In 32."
6467440,6468440," Alright."
6468440,6468440," So."
6468440,6469440," Yeah."
6469440,6470440," We read the image."
6470440,6471440," That is very cool."
6471440,6472440," To implement that specific algorithm."
6472440,6473440," Right."
6473440,6474440," So."
6474440,6475440," Now."
6475440,6476440," We have to implement it."
6476440,6477440," So."
6477440,6478440," We're going to be iterating."
6478440,6479440," Rollwise."
6479440,6480440," Alright."
6480440,6481440," So."
6481440,6482440," This is going to be more like y."
6482440,6483440," Less."
6483440,6484440," Image."
6484440,6485440," Image."
6485440,6486440," Height."
6486440,6487440," So."
6487440,6488440," This is plus plus y."
6488440,6489440," And then."
6489440,6490440," We're going to be."
6490440,6491440," Maybe iterating."
6491440,6492440," So."
6492440,6493440," This one is rather interesting."
6493440,6494440," So."
6494440,6495440," How are we going to be."
6495440,6496440," Approaching this entire thing."
6496440,6497440," Hmm."
6497440,6502440," Do I want to first."
6502440,6504440," Collect all of the tokens."
6504440,6505440," Into."
6505440,6506440," A list."
6506440,6507440," And then."
6507440,6508440," You know."
6508440,6509440," Process the images."
6509440,6510440," Stuff like that."
6510440,6512440," Or maybe I want to tokenize."
6512440,6513440," As I go."
6513440,6515440," That is a very interesting question."
6515440,6517440," I think I want to tokenize."
6517440,6518440," As I go."
6518440,6520440," I don't see anything wrong with that."
6520440,6522440," There is literally nothing wrong with that."
6522440,6523440," Like."
6523440,6524440," Tokenize as you go."
6524440,6525440," So."
6525440,6526440," So."
6526440,6527440," That way."
6527440,6528440," You pull."
6528440,6529440," Yet another token."
6529440,6530440," And then."
6530440,6531440," You just print it."
6531440,6532440," And stuff."
6532440,6533440," This is actually perfect."
6533440,6534440," Honestly."
6534440,6535440," Yeah."
6535440,6536440," That's cool."
6536440,6537440," So."
6537440,6538440," As we go with x."
6538440,6539440," Right."
6539440,6540440," So."
6540440,6541440," I."
6541440,6542440," Probably should do something like."
6542440,6543440," X."
6543440,6544440," Image."
6544440,6545440," Width."
6545440,6546440," Which does make sense."
6546440,6547440," Right."
6547440,6548440," But."
6548440,6549440," Doing plus plus x."
6549440,6550440," So."
6550440,6551440," Sometimes you will have to do."
6551440,6552440," Plus the size."
6552440,6553440," Of the token."
6553440,6554440," So."
6554440,6555440," Right."
6555440,6556440," So."
6556440,6557440," And the first thing we need to do."
6557440,6558440," We need to take a look at the pixels."
6558440,6559440," Right."
6559440,6559440," So."
6559440,6560440," The pixels."
6560440,6561440," Er."
6561440,6562440," Y."
6562440,6563440," Multiplied by."
6563440,6564440," Do we have stride?"
6564440,6565440," I think."
6565440,6566440," Yeah."
6566440,6566440," So."
6566440,6567440," We don't have stride."
6567440,6567440," So."
6567440,6568440," That means the stride is something like."
6568440,6569440," Image height."
6569440,6570440," Plus x."
6570440,6571440," And if that thing."
6571440,6572440," Is."
6572440,6573440," Basically."
6573440,6574440," FF0000."
6574440,6575440," Right."
6575440,6576440," So."
6576440,6577440," It's a background."
6577440,6577440," So."
6577440,6579440," We already established that the background is black."
6579440,6580440," Right."
6580440,6581440," So."
6581440,6582440," FF0000."
6582440,6583440," So."
6583440,6584440," This is a background."
6584440,6585440," What we're doing."
6585440,6587440," We're just printing the space."
6587440,6588440," And we are."
6588440,6589440," Incrementing x by one."
6589440,6590440," That's it."
6590440,6591440," So."
6591440,6592440," Otherwise."
6592440,6593440," If it's something else."
6593440,6594440," Right."
6594440,6595440," We're gonna make it a little bit."
6595440,6596440," Like more."
6596440,6597440," Full tolerant."
6597440,6598440," Full tolerant."
6598440,6599440," Um."
6599440,6600440," Actually."
6600440,6601440," So."
6601440,6603440," That means we have to do it the other way around."
6603440,6604440," Because."
6604440,6605440," I know for a fact."
6605440,6606440," That all of the."
6606440,6607440," Things are white."
6607440,6608440," Ah."
6608440,6609440," Whatever."
6609440,6610440," Um."
6610440,6611440," So."
6611440,6614440," Maybe I want to explicitly do all of these things."
6614440,6615440," Right."
6615440,6616440," And."
6616440,6617440," Essentially."
6617440,6618440," If."
6618440,6619440," We have."
6619440,6620440," Some colors."
6620440,6621440," That are not."
6621440,6623440," Part of what we expect."
6623440,6626440," We should probably throw something like."
6626440,6627440," Unreachable."
6627440,6628440," Assert."
6628440,6630440," Maybe we can even do something like."
6630440,6631440," Unreachable."
6631440,6632440," Unknown."
6632440,6633440," Color."
6633440,6636440," And we can try to print that color."
6636440,6637440," Like so."
6637440,6638440," Which is gonna be."
6638440,6639440," 0x."
6639440,6642440," And let's just print that specific color."
6642440,6644440," We might as well actually extract."
6644440,6645440," The pixel."
6645440,6648440," So it's a little bit easier for us to work with."
6648440,6649440," Right."
6649440,6650440," So this is gonna be pixel."
6650440,6652440," This is gonna be pixel."
6652440,6654440," And this one is gonna just return."
6654440,6655440," One."
6655440,6656440," Maybe even abort."
6656440,6657440," Let's just like."
6657440,6658440," Straight up abort."
6658440,6659440," We didn't expect that shit."
6659440,6660440," All right."
6660440,6661440," So."
6661440,6662440," And here."
6662440,6663440," If we."
6663440,6664440," Essentially."
6664440,6665440," Encounter."
6665440,6667440," A thing."
6667440,6668440," We need to put a token in here."
6668440,6670440," So we extract the token."
6670440,6671440," The."
6671440,6672440," The."
6672440,6673440," If."
6673440,6674440," If."
6674440,6675440," This entire thing."
6675440,6676440," Didn't succeed."
6676440,6677440," Extracting token."
6677440,6678440," We just returned one."
6678440,6679440," Right."
6679440,6680440," There is no point in continuing."
6680440,6682440," We ran out of tokens."
6682440,6684440," We literally ran out of tokens."
6684440,6685440," But if we."
6685440,6686440," Still have some tokens."
6686440,6687440," We just need to print."
6687440,6688440," That token."
6688440,6689440," Specifically."
6689440,6690440," Uh."
6690440,6691440," Like so."
6691440,6693440," We are printing that token."
6693440,6694440," Um."
6694440,6696440," But we have to print it without the new line."
6696440,6697440," Right."
6697440,6698440," So because they have to be stuck together."
6698440,6699440," Um."
6699440,6700440," Okay."
6700440,6702440," That's basically the entire of the algorithm."
6702440,6703440," Again."
6703440,6704440," It can overflow a little bit."
6704440,6705440," But that's fine."
6705440,6706440," That is totally fine."
6706440,6707440," Uh."
6707440,6708440," So at the end in here."
6708440,6709440," We probably have to do print."
6709440,6710440," F."
6710440,6711440," New line."
6711440,6712440," Uh."
6712440,6713440," And here's another interesting thing."
6713440,6714440," So what if you."
6714440,6717440," Still have a little bit of the tokens left."
6717440,6718440," I suppose."
6718440,6720440," We can just put them at the end."
6720440,6721440," To indicate that."
6721440,6722440," We still have some."
6722440,6723440," A little bit talking left."
6723440,6724440," Right."
6724440,6725440," So."
6725440,6727440," Then you can maybe adjust the size of the image."
6727440,6728440," Uh."
6728440,6729440," Right."
6729440,6730440," To make it look better."
6730440,6731440," So we'll see."
6731440,6732440," We'll see."
6732440,6733440," So it's."
6733440,6734440," It's semi-automatic."
6734440,6735440," Right."
6735440,6736440," It doesn't have to be automatic all the way through."
6736440,6737440," Uh."
6737440,6738440," Right."
6738440,6739440," So we're just like."
6739440,6740440," Letting the image guide."
6740440,6741440," And then adjusting things."
6741440,6742440," So that's the goal essentially."
6742440,6743440," That's the goal."
6743440,6744440," Anyways."
6744440,6745440," So."
6745440,6746440," But we also need to update."
6746440,6747440," Uh."
6747440,6748440," The X."
6748440,6749440," Right."
6749440,6750440," So I suppose."
6750440,6751440," One of the things we want to do in here."
6751440,6752440," We want to extract N."
6752440,6753440," And we're going to be."
6753440,6754440," Uh."
6754440,6755440," Updating it like that."
6755440,6756440," Right."
6756440,6757440," And I think that's it."
6757440,6758440," Honestly."
6758440,6759440," So."
6759440,6760440," Let's go ahead and see."
6760440,6762440," If it's going to produce anything interesting."
6762440,6763440," So we're going to try to compile."
6763440,6764440," Of course."
6764440,6765440," It's probably going to fail."
6765440,6766440," With some errors."
6766440,6767440," We're going to go through them."
6767440,6768440," And fix them."
6768440,6769440," image width."
6769440,6770440," Uh."
6770440,6771440," Right."
6771440,6772440," Image height."
6772440,6773440," So what's the next error?"
6773440,6774440," Uh huh."
6774440,6775440," This one is a semicolon."
6775440,6776440," That's fine."
6776440,6777440," What else do we have in here?"
6777440,6778440," So this is S."
6778440,6779440," So it says something about."
6779440,6780440," Uh."
6780440,6781440," Yeah."
6781440,6782440," int."
6782440,6783440," We can explicitly."
6783440,6784440," Int."
6784440,6785440," We can explicitly."
6785440,6786440," Instruct."
6786440,6787440," This thing to be."
6787440,6788440," Just int."
6788440,6789440," If it."
6789440,6790440," If that's what it wants."
6790440,6791440," Uh."
6791440,6792440," And that seems to be."
6792440,6793440," Okay."
6793440,6794440," So we need to."
6794440,6795440," Since."
6795440,6796440," We're reading images."
6796440,6798440," Link with the math library."
6798440,6799440," That's totally fine."
6799440,6800440," That is totally fine."
6800440,6801440," Okay."
6801440,6802440," That's cool."
6802440,6803440," Uh."
6803440,6804440," Okay."
6804440,6805440," So that seems to be working."
6805440,6806440," The moment of truth."
6806440,6807440," The moment of truth."
6807440,6808440," So I'm going to do image format."
6808440,6809440," So."
6809440,6810440," It expects the input."
6810440,6811440," Right."
6811440,6812440," So the input is going to be Conway."
6812440,6813440," Uh."
6813440,6814440," So."
6814440,6815440," Uh."
6815440,6816440," Offers C."
6816440,6817440," Right."
6817440,6817440," So."
6817440,6818440," And then it expects the image."
6818440,6820440," We're going to provide the image in here."
6820440,6821440," Uh."
6821440,6822440," All right."
6822440,6823440," So."
6823440,6825440," That kind of worked."
6825440,6826440," But I think the image."
6826440,6828440," The image is obviously too small."
6828440,6830440," I'm actually surprised."
6830440,6831440," That it is too small."
6831440,6833440," It managed to do."
6833440,6834440," This is kind of weird."
6834440,6836440," Yeah."
6836440,6837440," It is too small."
6837440,6840440," I think it also has to be a little bit wider."
6840440,6841440," Right."
6841440,6843440," Twice as wide actually."
6843440,6844440," So let's go ahead and adjust it."
6844440,6846440," So I'm going to open the glider in Krita."
6846440,6849440," And let's just mess with the sizes and stuff."
6849440,6853440," Let's just mess with the sizes."
6853440,6854440," Mm hmm."
6854440,6856440," So it must be a little bit wider."
6856440,6857440," Maybe twice as wide."
6857440,6859440," Mm hmm."
6859440,6860440," Mm hmm."
6860440,6861440," So image."
6861440,6862440," Uh."
6862440,6863440," Of."
6863440,6864440," Uh."
6864440,6865440," Scale."
6865440,6866440," So I'm going to."
6866440,6867440," Unlink this thing."
6867440,6870440," And I'm going to say that the width is going to be multiplied by two."
6870440,6871440," All right."
6871440,6872440," So this is what we got."
6872440,6873440," It's kind of funny."
6873440,6874440," All right."
6874440,6876440," But we're going to just save it as it is."
6876440,6877440," So."
6877440,6878440," Going to try to run this and that stuff."
6878440,6879440," Okay."
6879440,6880440," Uh."
6880440,6881440," That is honestly bizarre."
6881440,6883440," Like what the fuck is going on?"
6883440,6884440," Why is it like that?"
6884440,6887440," So there's obviously a box somewhere here."
6887440,6888440," You see that?"
6888440,6889440," You see that chat?"
6889440,6890440," There's something."
6890440,6891440," So also."
6891440,6892440," Yeah."
6892440,6896440," So there was some spaces in here, but like, I don't think you have to put."
6896440,6897440," Yeah."
6897440,6898440," And."
6898440,6899440," So there is something."
6899440,6900440," Yeah."
6900440,6901440," People already probably noticed something."
6901440,6902440," Yeah."
6902440,6903440," It's."
6903440,6904440," It has to be width."
6904440,6905440," You're right."
6905440,6906440," You're right."
6906440,6907440," You're right."
6907440,6908440," You're right."
6908440,6909440," Ah."
6909440,6910440," Freaking C."
6910440,6911440," Freaking C."
6911440,6912440," I swear to God."
6912440,6913440," Uh huh."
6913440,6917440," I don't really know why I did minus B, but."
6917440,6919440," Not bad."
6919440,6921440," So this thing has to be bigger."
6921440,6922440," Honestly."
6922440,6923440," This thing has to be bigger."
6923440,6924440," So it's actually."
6924440,6925440," A resized."
6925440,6926440," A resized."
6926440,6927440," To be fair."
6927440,6928440," This N bors."
6928440,6930440," Is too goddamn big."
6930440,6931440," In my opinion."
6931440,6932440," It's too goddamn big."
6932440,6934440," So what we have to do is probably."
6934440,6936440," Go into the office C."
6936440,6937440," Uh."
6937440,6938440," And."
6938440,6940440," Queer replace N bors to."
6940440,6941440," Let's call it N B."
6941440,6942440," Or maybe just N."
6942440,6944440," We don't even use N anywhere in here."
6944440,6945440," Yeah."
6945440,6946440," So we can just do that."
6946440,6947440," Who said we can't do that?"
6947440,6948440," We can do that."
6948440,6949440," So."
6949440,6950440," Uh."
6950440,6951440," So."
6951440,6952440," Yeah."
6952440,6953440," That's much better."
6953440,6954440," Look at that."
6954440,6955440," That is much better."
6955440,6956440," Right."
6956440,6958440," But we still have a lot of stuff left."
6958440,6961440," So that means we need to keep cranking up the size."
6961440,6962440," Of this entire thing."
6962440,6963440," So."
6963440,6964440," Uh."
6964440,6965440," Scale."
6965440,6966440," Scale image."
6966440,6967440," Right."
6967440,6968440," So let's."
6968440,6969440," Connect all of these things together."
6969440,6970440," And let's just maybe."
6970440,6971440," Multiply by two."
6971440,6972440," Right."
6972440,6974440," So we have twice of this kind of stuff."
6974440,6975440," Right."
6975440,6976440," So we have twice of that."
6976440,6977440," Uh."
6977440,6978440," Let's see if it's going to do them."
6978440,6979440," I."
6979440,6980440," Why am I rebuilding everything?"
6980440,6981440," Am I."
6981440,6982440," Am I an idiot?"
6982440,6983440," Yeah."
6983440,6984440," I am an idiot."
6984440,6985440," Okay."
6985440,6986440," So now we don't really have enough of this stuff."
6986440,6987440," Right."
6987440,6988440," So I think."
6988440,6990440," Doing twice was a little bit of a mistake."
6990440,6991440," So."
6991440,6992440," Let's not do that."
6992440,6994440," So we're trying to sort of optimize it."
6994440,6995440," To be fair."
6995440,6996440," To be fair."
6996440,6997440," Nah."
6997440,6998440," Nah."
6998440,6999440," Nah."
6999440,7000440," Nah."
7000440,7001440," Maybe fine."
7001440,7002440," Wait."
7002440,7004440," I've got an interesting idea."
7004440,7005440," What if we."
7005440,7008440," For the string literals."
7008440,7010440," For the string literals."
7010440,7011440," We literally just."
7011440,7016440," Split them by characters."
7016440,7019440," Like we literally split them by characters."
7019440,7020440," Or something like that."
7020440,7022440," That would be kind of cool actually."
7022440,7023440," Uh."
7023440,7024440," Right."
7024440,7025440," So."
7025440,7030440," Where's the scale."
7030440,7031440," Scale image."
7031440,7032440," Uh."
7032440,7034440," I think I can just remember."
7034440,7035440," Ctrl+Alt+I."
7035440,7036440," Yeah."
7036440,7037440," There we go."
7037440,7038440," Um."
7038440,7039440," So."
7039440,7040440," This one is."
7040440,7041440," Was that."
7041440,7042440," Right."
7042440,7043440," So."
7043440,7044440," Yeah."
7044440,7045440," Um."
7045440,7046440," Ctrl+Alt+I."
7046440,7048440," So let's multiply it by half."
7048440,7049440," Uh."
7049440,7050440," Of this thing."
7050440,7051440," Right."
7051440,7052440," So we multiplied it by half."
7052440,7053440," Uh."
7053440,7054440," Let me."
7054440,7055440," Let me see."
7055440,7056440," 45."
7056440,7057440," And."
7057440,7058440," Like this."
7058440,7059440," All right."
7059440,7061440," So that looks good."
7061440,7067440," Just a little bit more."
7067440,7068440," Look at this."
7068440,7069440," Squares."
7069440,7070440," Look at this."
7070440,7071440," Motherflipping squares."
7071440,7072440," Holy shit."
7072440,7073440," Uh."
7073440,7074440," So."
7074440,7075440," God damn."
7075440,7076440," Squares."
7076440,7077440," Squares."
7077440,7078440," Okay."
7078440,7079440," So."
7079440,7080440," I can try to maybe."
7080440,7081440," Uh."
7081440,7083440," Multiply it by."
7083440,7084440," One."
7084440,7085440," Like."
7085440,7086440," Zero point."
7086440,7087440," Oh my god."
7087440,7088440," What the fuck has happened."
7088440,7089440," Uh."
7089440,7091440," I'm just trying to show what I'm multiplying it by."
7091440,7092440," I'm multiplying it by one."
7092440,7093440," So."
7093440,7094440," Actually."
7094440,7095440," One."
7095440,7096440," One."
7096440,7097440," That's what I want to do."
7097440,7098440," Yeah."
7098440,7099440," A little bit more."
7099440,7100440," Uh."
7100440,7102440," I'm trying to preserve the ratio."
7102440,7104440," If you know what I mean."
7104440,7105440," Yeah."
7105440,7106440," Okay."
7106440,7107440," Okay."
7107440,7108440," Okay."
7108440,7109440," Let's try to do this thing."
7109440,7110440," Um."
7110440,7111440," Conway."
7111440,7112440," Conway."
7112440,7113440," Conway."
7113440,7114440," C."
7114440,7115440," Uh huh."
7115440,7116440," Conway."
7116440,7117440," C."
7117440,7118440," Uh."
7118440,7119440," Whitespace."
7119440,7130440," So."
7130440,7132440," There is a little bit of weird thing in here."
7132440,7135440," So I think it would be better without this kind of space."
7135440,7136440," Alright."
7136440,7137440," So."
7137440,7138440," Oh."
7138440,7140440," What if I now build."
7140440,7141440," This thing."
7141440,7142440," Conway."
7142440,7143440," Conway."
7143440,7144440," C."
7144440,7145440," It does build."
7145440,7146440," Okay."
7146440,7148440," And then if I try to run it."
7148440,7149440," It works."
7149440,7160440," Oh wait."
7160440,7161440," This is so cool."
7161440,7162440," Thank you."
7162440,7163440," Thank you so much."
7163440,7164440," Uh."
7164440,7165440," All right."
7165440,7166440," So."
7166440,7167440," We can even do something like."
7167440,7168440," Wait a freaking second."
7168440,7169440," Uh."
7169440,7170440," Sodin."
7170440,7176440," Damn."
7176440,7177440," Brof."
7177440,7178440," Damn."
7178440,7179440," Oh."
7179440,7180440," All right."
7180440,7181440," So."
7181440,7183440," And it in fact works."
7183440,7184440," Right."
7184440,7185440," Look at that."
7185440,7186440," Look at that."
7186440,7187440," So."
7187440,7188440," So maybe we can."
7188440,7189440," We can do something like."
7189440,7190440," Something like."
7190440,7191440," Um."
7191440,7192440," So."
7192440,7193440," Expert."
7193440,7194440," PS1."
7194440,7195440," So if you don't know what is this."
7195440,7196440," Uh."
7196440,7197440," Environment variable."
7197440,7199440," This is a variable responsible for your prompt."
7199440,7202440," So one of the things I like to do for demos and stuff like that."
7202440,7203440," I like to."
7203440,7204440," Set the prompt to."
7204440,7205440," Dollar space."
7205440,7208440," So it gets rid of the huge prompt."
7208440,7209440," Right."
7209440,7211440," Which allows me to do things like."
7211440,7212440," Cut."
7212440,7213440," Um."
7213440,7213440," You know."
7213440,7214440," Conway."
7214440,7215440," C."
7215440,7216440," Right."
7216440,7217440," Maybe even."
7217440,7218440," Something like this."
7218440,7219440," And then I can do."
7219440,7220440," C."
7220440,7221440," O."
7221440,7222440," Conway."
7222440,7223440," Conway."
7223440,7224440," C."
7224440,7225440," Right."
7225440,7226440," And then I just run."
7226440,7227440," Conway."
7227440,7229440," And it kind of works."
7229440,7232440," So I don't like that it has warnings and stuff like that."
7232440,7235440," I would like to also get rid of the you sleep."
7235440,7236440," Um."
7236440,7237440," So I don't really know."
7237440,7238440," Right."
7238440,7239440," We'll see."
7239440,7240440," We'll see."
7240440,7241440," Uh."
7241440,7242440," It's one of the shapes from the game."
7242440,7243440," Exactly."
7243440,7244440," Exactly."
7244440,7245440," That's what we've done."
7245440,7247440," So this is what we produced on today's stream."
7247440,7249440," I implemented this thing live."
7249440,7250440," Um."
7250440,7251440," So."
7251440,7252440," To disable all warnings."
7252440,7253440," Okay."
7253440,7254440," So let me see."
7254440,7255440," Uh."
7255440,7256440," All right."
7256440,7257440," So that's."
7257440,7258440," That's cool."
7258440,7259440," So cool."
7259440,7260440," But I think it has to be recorded actually as a video."
7260440,7261440," Right."
7261440,7262440," It has to be recorded as a video."
7262440,7263440," So where I just do."
7263440,7264440," Cut."
7264440,7265440," And then."
7265440,7266440," Boom."
7266440,7268440," And it does that."
7268440,7269440," Right."
7269440,7271440," And then I should post that on Twitter."
7271440,7273440," And get all of the internet points."
7273440,7274440," Duh."
7274440,7275440," Duh."
7275440,7276440," Duh."
7276440,7278440," So I'm going to post all of these things."
7278440,7279440," Uh."
7279440,7280440," In my Discord server."
7280440,7281440," Right."
7281440,7282440," So after the stream."
7282440,7283440," Right."
7283440,7284440," So I'm going to prepare everything."
7284440,7285440," I'm going to then."
7285440,7286440," Um."
7286440,7287440," You know."
7287440,7288440," Upload to GitHub and stuff like that."
7288440,7289440," But only after I actually uploaded all of that stuff to."
7289440,7290440," To."
7290440,7291440," To clear."
7291440,7292440," Right."
7292440,7293440," All right."
7293440,7294440," So that was fun."
7294440,7295440," Actually, I didn't expect that I'm going to end up with something interesting."
7295440,7296440," Right."
7296440,7297440," So that was super cool."
7297440,7299440," Thanks everyone who's watching right now."
7299440,7300440," I really appreciate it."
7300440,7301440," Have a good one."
7301440,7304440," And I see you all on the next recreation programming session with Amistazozin."
7304440,7307440," So now you know how these kind of things are done."
7307440,7308440," Uh."
7308440,7309440," Right."
7309440,7310440," So they're just basically semi-automatic."
7310440,7311440," Right."
7311440,7312440," Anyways."
7312440,7313440," Uh."
7313440,7314440," Love you."
7314440,7315440," Mwah."
7315440,7316520," Thank you."
