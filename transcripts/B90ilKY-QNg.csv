0,12600," um all right looks like we're finally live hello everyone and welcome to another zozin session"
12600,21100," how about that how about that i bet you didn't expect that shit to happen welcome everyone uh so"
21100,29600," today is uh basically the fourth day of uh advent of code in god's temple so today we're gonna just"
29600,36820," do the fourth day as usual before we uh do though i think we need to make a little bit of announcement"
36820,48580," uh on our discord server um right circle live on twitch uh and i'm gonna i just realized that"
48580,54420," uh i didn't bring the dashboard so i should have actually brought it super quick but i mean it's"
54420,60380," not that big of a deal so today is the day fourth and uh i'm gonna give the link to the twitch channel"
60380,67000," twitch.tv slash coding and i'm gonna ping everyone who's interested in being pinged there we go the"
67000,73600," stream has officially started the stream has officially started uh hello everyone welcome"
73600,80780," welcome welcome hello memorial amarillo hello lenny low welcome so uh before i start i wanted"
80780,87940," to actually do a little bit of a refactoring uh of our solutions because uh we have a little bit of a"
87940,93460," common code that i keep reusing across several solutions and i thought that i'm gonna take that"
93460,100680," code and pull it out into some sort of like a utility uh module so i can reuse it uh in other solutions"
100680,107300," so that's basically what i wanted to do today uh oh thank you for reminding me to change the title yeah"
107300,113620," that's right so the problem uh here is that uh opening twitch when i'm streaming is extremely slow"
113620,120640," and i forgot to bring in the um the dashboard so like look how much time it takes to actually like"
120640,128800," start it up uh right and now i clicked on this thing and i need to wait until it always shows and then i"
128800,135440," need to do pop-up and then uh i have to close it yet again it's just like it's so slow it is so slow"
135440,142980," oh it feels like cia infiltrated twitch that's what it feels like uh so let me quickly change the title to"
142980,152180," day uh four thank you so much everyone who uh who reminded me about that um okay so let's go um"
152180,160660," studying aoc 2021 you can find the source code to my solutions in the description right here so all"
160660,165520," the necessary links are available in the description and if you're watching live i'm going to copy paste"
165520,175040," the solution uh the solution in the chat okay so let's go and start uh the aoc image so i also need"
175040,179920," to provide the the password and there we go hello hello everyone um"
179920,190640," loading the compiler um okay i need to answer no then i'm going to close out the completion and i"
190640,195120," like to sort of like uh expand this and i think maybe i need to put all of these actions"
195120,200880," into my home script because you can actually customize how the operating system starts up"
200880,204960," so maybe i'm going to get rid of the tip of the day no i'm not going to get rid of the tip of the day i"
204960,210000," think it's a pretty useful feature i probably want to get rid of the take tour uh but i'm not sure so"
210000,215680," this thing includes once so that means it includes it from the from the c or something but i don't want"
215680,223040," to go into that uh on the stream so i'm going to go into that a little bit later so uh let's go to the aoc folder"
223040,228320," and uh let's take a look at the first solution right so as already said there is something that is shared"
228320,235200," across several solutions and this is something that we need to pull out so the first code that is quite"
235200,244480," often appears right is this one essentially i have uh some stream of uh bytes right basically the bytes"
244480,251760," that i read from a file and i chop off the numbers from them i parsed the numbers out of that uh stream of"
251760,260000," bytes so what i was thinking it's actually a good opportunity to use my string view library uh right"
260000,267200," so let me actually show you what i mean so i have a pretty cool string view library uh which basically"
267200,273280," defines uh my own string which is the amount of characters and the pointer to the beginning of the"
273280,281440," string and then it defines a lot of useful operations on that string view thingy so and while i was solving"
281440,287440," problems in holy c for advent of code i was constantly constantly thinking it would be kind of nice to"
287440,293520," have this sort of library but for holy c so i think what i'm going to do i'm going to just basically like"
293520,299680," partially re-implement that library but in holy c uh and put it into some sort of like a common module so i"
299680,306560," can reuse it uh across several solutions right so um that's what i wanted to do before i start the fourth day"
307760,312080," so and i'm going to put this thing in the description for anyone who's interested uh in what i'm talking"
312080,320160," about string uh view library in c so this one is my string library in c and i'm going to copy paste this"
320160,322160," this one is my string library in c and i'm going to copy paste this one is my string library in c and i'm going to"
322160,326160," this one is my string library in c and i'm going to copy paste this one is my string library in c and i'm going to"
326160,330160," this one is my string library in c and i'm going to copy paste this one is my string library in c and i'm going to be"
330160,335680," yeah pretty much almost it's not going to be like one by like one to one port and i'm not going to"
335680,341440," port everything i'm just going to port like a bare minimum that i use in my solutions right it's going"
341440,346080," to be like i don't know maybe a couple of functions and the structure definition or something like that"
346080,351280," so uh we're going to start we're going to actually start doing that in this solution so i don't have"
351280,355920," to jump between the files or anything like that the first thing i want to do i want to define the"
355920,361760," string view structure unfortunately there is no structures in holy c right if you try to do"
361760,369840," something like struct uh string view uh first of all struct is not even highlighted uh second of all"
369840,375840," uh let's actually go ahead and define everything so this is going to be i64 count all right and this one"
375840,382320," is going to be u8 uh data and if i try to compile this entire thing it is not going to compile it will"
382320,389520," say i didn't identify the identifier at string view um so which is kind of weird like it doesn't even"
389520,397680," complain extract it complains um about string view but here's the thing so there's no structures in holy"
397680,403200," c if i remember correctly right so maybe i should have to put like a semicolon yeah it still complains"
403200,414800," there are only classes right you can define classes and weirdly enough classes are just like uh pure c"
414800,421440," structures they're not like c++ classes they cannot have methods so semantically they're pretty much the"
421440,428880," same as the um as the c classes as as the c structures but they're just called classes i think it's not entirely"
428880,435760," true i think there are some ways to sort of like do unions and some sort of like a type hierarchy but"
435760,449760," it's not op um yeah so it defines like a class for i64 as far as now i64 is um is not just a primitive"
449760,456000," type it's a class and i wonder if i can actually out yeah i think i can jump to the definition i64"
456000,463600," yeah there we go it's like it's a union right and union is almost like a class and the primitive type"
463600,471840," is i64 i but i64 is a union that allows you to access different parts of the i64 integer"
471840,479920," so this is really interesting uh right so this is a very interesting feature you can define the class"
479920,485920," and then you can say okay you can access this class as the primitive and if all of the fields fit into"
485920,489840," that primitive it's going to be that primitive and then you can will be able to access different"
489840,494960," parts of that primitive or something like that so it's it's kind of really interesting and weird at the same time"
495840,505840," um enter my holy temple in fight to dingasim thank you so much uh for 30 months of tier two subscription"
505840,510240," thank you thank you thank you and welcome to our epic temple club uh cheers"
510240,522000," uh thank you 30 months oh my god all right so um class is going to work right and uh one of the operations"
522000,528880," that we have in here is um basically chopping the number so what i want you to do maybe i want you to"
528880,542960," define something like this um um how do i'm gonna say that um sv sv chop i64 right and i'm gonna accept"
542960,550400," string view uh sv you know what i don't really like to type a lot especially in such a tight text editor"
550400,556480," so i think i'm going to actually rename string to sv uh right so and this is going to be sv which will"
556480,563280," uh reduce the amount of things i have to type uh and this entire thing is going to return i64 uh right and"
563280,570160," then we'll have to define it like this so uh and essentially i'm going to just like move this repetitive"
570160,580960," code into this function right uh all right how are we gonna do all of that str2i64 i have to provide"
580960,586960," the pointer to the beginning the beginning starts here svdata then i have to provide the radix okay i"
586960,593600," think a switch of i64 has to um has to have a customizable radix so let's actually accept the radix here"
593600,599280," as well because who knows maybe i want to customize it in fact i can make it default yeah what's cool about"
599280,605840," how we see is that it finally has uh default parameters it's semantically very close to c rather"
605840,611840," than c plus plus but it has some of the c plus plus nice features like default parameters and stuff like"
611840,617760," that and you know what's cooler is that the default parameters doesn't don't have to be at the end of"
617760,622800," the function that's what's cool about all of that they don't have to be at the end of the function"
622800,633360," so if you have something like uh you zero fool you can have something like i64 a 69 and then i64 b and that"
633360,641600," is going to work the question is how would you specify b then well you specify it like this"
643120,649680," so you skip the default parameters you literally skip them so if you have several parameters"
649680,657840," uh in here so i64 c uh which also doesn't have the default uh you would specify it like this uh 23"
657840,659680," then you skipped one and here is another one so"
659680,669200," another one so which is actually kind of interesting uh yeah so you literally just skip it uh and that's"
669200,676240," fine um so that's a very interesting like a fresh approach to the default parameters i think um"
680240,686480," i'm not sure if it's legal but i like it uh you mean where would it be illegal in in which states of"
686480,694800," the russian federation would that be illegal also i actually wanna oh god damn it i press that thing"
694800,706640," yet again uh so let me get rid of that hopefully yeah there we go uh so all right and then here i have"
706640,713120," to provide the pointer to the end right so we'll have to allocate that end somewhere here uh u8 and p"
713120,721200," and then this entire thing should return the result there we go after that i need to"
721200,731600," probably subtract the size uh of this entire thing so i need to take and p minus sv data so this is"
731600,737440," basically uh the end pointer minus the beginning is how many characters we consumed and this is the"
737440,742720," amount of characters that we want to subtract from the final size of the string view uh right so that's"
742720,751520," basically what we want to do uh and then uh i'm gonna assign the new beginning to the end um right"
751520,756160," and that's pretty much it and the only thing i need to do here is just like return the result"
756720,761840," uh i think and if i try to compile the entire thing everything compiles oh here's another cool thing"
761840,769600," you can always check how the compiler compiled the basically the generated assembly uh so oh yeah thank"
769600,776000," you so much so it's minus equals of course of course it is minus equals so ufsv"
778800,785200," chop i64 right and then you're gonna run it and there we go so here's the generated assembly so this"
785200,790320," is how that function looks like in assembly and to be fair it generates pretty small assembly not gonna"
790320,796400," lie so it's rather compact it's definitely more compact than whatever ports generates right"
796400,802880," so but port is not finished yet terry worked on this thing for like more than 10 years i worked on port"
802880,808400," like four how many three four months or something and not even actively not even every day so"
808400,819840," all right so and essentially with this function there's uh uf it just prints the assembly right"
819840,824320," uh we can even take a look at the definition we can even go into the implementation of that function"
824320,828800," right and just read it and stuff like that as you can see here is the function"
829360,837600," uh it finds the function in the hash table so there's fs oh so all right so all of the compiled"
837600,842880," functions are located in some sort of like a global hash table that you can actually query and you can"
842880,850080," query things by name and then yeah that's actually pretty cool and then it goes to like an actual uh"
850080,854160," disassembly or something like that that's very interesting you can even explore how things work on this"
854160,861840," entire operating system it looks like i'm sorry terry but it like ui looks like but the conceptually it's"
861840,868880," fucking amazing like i wish there was something like temple os but with actually usable like ui and ux and"
868880,876560," it would be like holy fucking so yeah it's just freaking amazing like i really like how explorability"
876560,883040," so you're just like yeah uh from time to time i just like you know disconnect from the internet and i open"
883040,890400," up temple os and i just explore it it's an operating system that is interesting to just explore uh right"
890400,895360," it's like it's almost like you're playing like an adventure game right you never know what uh with what"
895360,900560," awaits you ahead right so you just dive into the code of the temple os and you just explore it just use"
900560,905200," different functions and you always explore something new about this operating system it's just so"
905200,911280," amazing i really like it um okay so everything seems to be compelling and let's see how we can use this"
911280,920240," function so first of all um right so here we have a begin and here we have a size um though interestingly"
920240,928960," enough i always need to keep track of the begin otherwise i won't be able to um to free it right because"
928960,935440," every time you do file read uh it actually mallocs it so i guess i'm going to just keep it then so here"
935440,943280," i'll have to construct the new string view right so this is going to be sv sv uh right and sv count is"
943280,948720," going to be equal to the size that we just read and sv data is going to be equal to the begin right"
950320,958480," and while uh sv maybe i should have called it count actually size rather than count because then it will"
958480,964240," be easier to uh you know customize the code to to modify the code that's what i was trying to say"
964240,968480," so let's actually call the size so size data"
970800,978320," maybe you should also call this thing a begin of some sort i'm really not sure i'm really not sure"
978320,982240," but they can try okay so here is the uh-huh"
985760,1000560," begin then size and minus begin and then begin is basically equals to end p okay so this is the size"
1000560,1008880," and again the way i wanted to approach that i wanted to just define this thing in here and then say okay"
1008880,1017440," sv begin is now equal file read sv size and then it will just work but uh then as i actually like"
1017440,1023360," parse everything i will forget the beginning and i won't be able to uh you know to free that thing"
1023360,1032480," which is kind of a shame but i can do something like i don't know um let's call it like uh saved begin"
1032480,1042800," right sv begin it's a saved begin and then i free that saved begin uh save begin all right so and while"
1042800,1050640," the sv size sv size is greater than one uh i should be able to do the following thing i should be able"
1050640,1059360," to say x equal sv chop i64 pointer to the sv and the radix i don't have to provide the radix so after that"
1059920,1069200," this should be basically it right so uh so this single line allows me to essentially remove this"
1069200,1076880," line and these two lines right so it just allows me to do that um very straightforward so we basically"
1076880,1079120," consume that thing over and over again"
1079120,1089840," looks a little bit better already i think i think it does look a little bit better so uh"
1089920,1095680," let me go ahead and just maybe comment out the part two and um it doesn't even compile also because"
1095680,1100640," we have unused variable size so let's go ahead and remove that unused variable size"
1100640,1106160," so it's located in here and if i yeah there we go so everything's fine"
1106160,1114560," cool uh the next thing i want to do um let's get rid of the unused variable size in here and do the same"
1114560,1125360," thing sv sv sv then sv begin uh then sv size uh and here i don't have to have this thing but i do need"
1125360,1138480," u8 uh saved uh begin and i just assign sv begin in there uh as we begin so and here we have a b c d so and for"
1138480,1145120," for each character in here for each variable we have to actually do three lines but uh now with this"
1145120,1153840," function uh sv chop i64 you can just do sv and that's it so it allows me to just remove this stuff"
1153840,1160880," uh okay and it kind of like didn't work exactly as i expected but that's fine"
1161440,1176880," sv chop i64 sv and now i'm gonna take this thing and put it like this sv chop i64 sv there we go so that"
1176880,1184720," make made this code a little bit easier to read and a little bit easier to maintain did it not i think it"
1184720,1193280," did right um yeah so you just basically chop i64 out of this thing and that's it so and for the d"
1193280,1202960," uh we're going to have something like this right so it's gonna be sv chop i64 sv uh and"
1202960,1210880," yeah can remove that and i think i can also do something like this okay so this is like way more"
1210880,1218160," readable than it was before uh and now i can say saved begin uh and here i can just remove this"
1218160,1223520," entire thing so if i run it it does not compile it does not compile on the line 50 so let's actually go"
1223520,1229840," to the line 50 so what does it say oh because i have to actually do sv size not just size and everything"
1229840,1237360," is working as usual again okay so i think it's simplified everything um right and uh maybe the time has"
1237360,1247840," come to sort of take these two definitions the classes v and um oh my god the classes v and uh"
1247840,1252560," a switch of i64 and put it into some sort of like a common module that can be reused across several"
1252560,1258000," solutions because like iridian and chopping things like that is way uh easier than like manually like"
1258000,1263040," this right so you don't have to keep track of the size anymore so it kept track by these operations so"
1263040,1270320," which is rather convenient what do you guys think uh all righty so let me see how we can do that so i"
1270320,1277040," think i'm gonna keep all of that in the common module like higher in hierarchy somewhere here so"
1277040,1284960," here are all the solutions and here we can have something like uh maybe i don't know common uh hc right"
1286640,1296960," uh so let's put some a little bit of documentation here uh here we keep uh keep common code that is"
1296960,1307040," shared uh across all uh did i spell across correctly i don't know across maybe not i forgot how do you spell"
1307040,1315680," across is that double c or it's actually single c i don't know why i actually like don't was was not sure"
1315680,1324320," about that uh shared across all of these solutions right and maybe i'm gonna split this entire line"
1324320,1334400," into two lines okay so cool um yeah and i need to actually open two editors uh so i can copy paste"
1334400,1345200," uh solution from one to another so i'm gonna just do something like this uh aoc um o1 main hc and let me"
1345200,1352880," quickly just like copy paste this entire stuff so i'm gonna copy paste it in here uh a boom so i'm"
1352880,1364400," gonna save it and in here i probably need to also uh like include stuff um i wonder if it's gonna work"
1364400,1374480," because the current folder is yeah probably it depends on your current uh folders so probably you want to do it"
1374480,1384960," somewhere here right because i already set it uh to to this folder uh common hc common hc and that should"
1384960,1393600," work hopefully so i'm gonna save that and just quit that and let me maybe make that a little bit bigger"
1394640,1403440," let me make that a little bit bigger so o1 uh hc and if i try to compile this entire thing okay so i did"
1403440,1412160," uh um file not found c common hc all right that is very interesting so it literally tried to find that"
1412160,1416160," thing in there which doesn't make sense okay so we're gonna have some problems with"
1417200,1423840," oh boy uh with search paths i i'm not even sure how to do search paths so maybe i'm gonna just do"
1423840,1429360," something like aoc 2021 and this is how i'm gonna include everything okay so from now on this is how"
1429360,1435120," i'm gonna include things until i figure out how to um how to properly do include paths"
1439840,1447440," all right so um this is basically everything what i wanted to do for this problem so let me go ahead"
1447440,1455360," and commit the changes right so the way we're gonna commit the changes i'm gonna do sync uh to the host"
1455920,1463520," aoc 2021 uh all right so i'm syncing to the host to get diff uh all right so this is basically the"
1463520,1468720," changes that we made so you see how much we actually compressed in here so that's actually pretty good"
1468720,1478080," um this is how much we managed to compress and um so let me see git status uh git add aoc"
1479200,1488000," git status and then again can come here i can commit everything in here add a common hc module"
1488000,1497840," okay so i also want to remove main.c um okay okay i see 2021"
1497840,1505760," so uh let's go to the second solution right uh in the second solution"
1507840,1509920," we can probably try to use the same things"
1509920,1523600," so o2 uh there we go so main dot hc all right uh so here we also have like a parse word which is"
1523600,1531200," something that we probably also want to include in the uh in our common folder right so in case of a"
1531200,1537760," parse word i'm actually looking for something that is it's a little bit complicated so i'm not"
1537760,1543120," really sure um we'll see we'll see so first of all i want to do the following thing i want to include"
1543120,1557440," uh c home aoc 2021 uh common common hc right something like this right and parse word or maybe"
1557440,1564320," in this case i want to say something like chop word right so this one as far as i know you can't return"
1564320,1571440," structures in temple os if i remember correctly so we can even try to confirm that so if i create something"
1571440,1579840," like foo which is supposed to return structure uh right and then uh i create structure on the stack"
1579840,1588240," and then i say that the size is going to be equal to zero right so this is zero and the begin is going to be"
1588240,1593920," equal to null right and then i'm going to try to return sv what's going to happen i can compile"
1593920,1600160," everything but if you take a look at the assembly of this function there's something really fishy about"
1600160,1607600," that i don't think it's going to work that well all right so it basically allocates 10 bytes on the stack"
1607600,1615520," i suppose i suppose that's the size of the um of the structure then it assigns zero to one field in here"
1615520,1624400," and zero to another field and then it adds first field to racks which i assume you assume is the way"
1624400,1634560," it returns the value so what so i don't think it's going to work and furthermore like this entire code compiles"
1634560,1640400," right this entire code compiles uh and if you try to sort of create sva"
1640400,1646320," foo this will not compile because you cannot initialize the variables like this"
1646320,1653360," um right you cannot initialize them like that so it's kind of weird you can create you can create this function"
1653360,1660800," this function will compile it will do incorrect and you won't be able to even call that function"
1660800,1669360," to return that structure anyway so it is really weird right so you cannot do any harm"
1669360,1679840," right anyway but it's just weird that this compiles right so yeah the function that you're trying to write"
1679840,1684560," compiles it is incorrect but since you cannot use it no harm is done"
1686720,1691600," you see what i'm talking about do you do you understand the the irony of this entire situation because it's really"
1691600,1698960," fucking ironic uh right it's just like okay okay it's kind of weird why does it compile in the first place"
1698960,1704400," no harm by design yeah i suppose"
1709840,1714560," it's just kind of funny uh anyway so this is just something that i wanted to point out"
1714560,1721200," uh all right so and because of that we cannot return the structure right so because of that if i"
1721200,1727040," want to out return the string view i have to return it through the arguments uh so i want to do something"
1727040,1739440," like sv chop word right uh word and i'm going to accept sv um basically input right so this is the input"
1739440,1746800," and then we're going to have sv output right so this is going to be the word um something like that right"
1746800,1752400," so and this is where we're going to start doing all that stuff um so let me see"
1755200,1762480," um all right so how are we gonna do all of that so essentially"
1762480,1772720," we have to kind of keep track yeah we need like a variable i that starts at zero"
1774160,1784240," and while i is less than input um is less than input uh size and"
1784240,1788800," so the input"
1788800,1799440," begin the input begin is alpha or something like that so it would be nice to have something like is alpha"
1800160,1808160," uh right so is alpha but i don't think we have is alpha is there something like is alpha in temple os"
1808160,1813840," uh is there something like that because it's kind of weird that there is not"
1813840,1820400," um and i i'm just a little bit afraid to create my own because maybe there is already something who knows"
1821040,1826880," uh so let me let me see um holy see is alpha"
1826880,1832320," so"
1832320,1839600," i guess i'm gonna assume that there is no such thing as holy c so uh let me just create my own one then"
1840320,1842960," so here i'm gonna assume uh boolean"
1842960,1851040," is alpha uh so and here i'm gonna accept like u8 i suppose so this is the character"
1851040,1854080," so is there something like char there is no such thing as char"
1854080,1862480," uh right and in our case is alpha is essentially so you know what i'm gonna actually call it like x"
1863040,1870480," right so this is gonna be x and we're gonna return uh a less or equal and i think in holy c you can even"
1870480,1878400," do things like that right so we can say this uh or uh a uh do something"
1878400,1885600," uh thank you so much do something idiot uh for a three month thank you thank you thank you and welcome"
1885600,1892240," back to our uh temple us club all right so and we can even do something like this uh not that it matters"
1892240,1897680," but yeah um um is alpha"
1897680,1909840," all right so and we all we're gonna put all of that into the uh into the common code all right so all that"
1909840,1915520," is going to be put into the common code right while this thing he has anything and this thing"
1915520,1921760," is alpha we're going to be basically incrementing uh i but furthermore i can probably say that it has to"
1921760,1929520," be like like this right so it has to be like this uh and after that uh i need to do the following thing"
1929520,1937440," word begin is going to start at the beginning of the input right so this is where it starts then word"
1937440,1945440," size is equal to i right that makes sense uh then uh input begin uh is essentially going to"
1945440,1953600," be plus i and input size is going to be minus i so that's essentially allows us to sort of chop a word"
1953600,1959440," out of string view right that's essentially what we're doing in here so let me compile this entire"
1959440,1964240," thing it seems to be compiling and now we can remove this entire stuff so it's not needed anymore"
1968000,1978080," okay so we don't need uh sizing here so we have to do sv sv uh and then i'm gonna do sv begin and this one"
1978080,1990320," is going to be sv size so here i probably need to keep the saved uh the saved begin uh saved begin uh sv begin"
1990960,1998640," all right so and i'm parsing a word i'm parsing a word which is rather interesting so that means"
1998640,2008400," i need to have another sv but for the word right another sv but for the word uh let me see so this"
2008400,2016880," is going to be sv chop word the input is going to be sv the output is going to be word uh right like this"
2016880,2029520," uh and oh i do remember this thing i do kind of remember and i'm not even sure so here we do additional"
2029520,2039520," plus one but it is needed just to trim some spaces so uh we'll see how we can do that um okay so we"
2039520,2043520," parse a word um and in that case n"
2043520,2053200," we don't even need n anymore because now n is the size of the word right so this is going to be a word"
2054560,2059520," size and by the size of the word we can dispatch between these entire things and everything's fine"
2059520,2069920," all right so then i can do sv chop i64 i do sv and i'm going to assign all of that to x"
2069920,2081520," uh right but then i also need to remove that extra extra one so i need basically a function that will trim"
2081520,2094560," white spaces so let me let me see"
2094560,2110720," so uh i want to i want to make a small break real quick just a second um right so uh let's continue so"
2110720,2120000," what i need to do here is to go back to my uh to my text file um let's go back to my text file and"
2120000,2129520," it would be nice to just like have something uh like u zero sv uh skip uh maybe not skip maybe trim"
2129520,2136000," right trim um let's call it left right so it's going to accept the sv and it's going to be like basically"
2136000,2141760," trim left but to be able to trim left we need to be able to distinguish between the regular characters"
2141760,2147920," and the white space characters right so let's actually have something boolean is space uh and in"
2147920,2156480," our case we're going to have um only two white spaces i think um right i wonder how i can do that so"
2157920,2164160," we can try to assign uh the white spaces to um basically the table of white spaces to some sort"
2164160,2169920," of like a string uh so i'm going to do it ws and then here we're going to have a regular white space"
2169920,2174800," and the new line right so far later we're going to add more of them so i'm not going to try to implement"
2174800,2180560," like everything at once uh so do we have something like str len right so we do have something like a"
2180560,2187840," sterling which is nice uh okay i clicked on it and nothing happened which is really weird uh let me do"
2187840,2194320," that one more time please okay thank you thank you so much uh and this thing i suppose it's just like"
2194320,2200320," a string length but it doesn't say anything about no terminated okay so that's fine uh right so this is"
2200320,2206240," gonna be something like this and here we're gonna have i64 to be fair maybe we don't even need to do that"
2206240,2214240," because it is relatively easy to just do something like this while uh you know ws um"
2214240,2225120," ws not equal maybe not equal zero uh or something even like that"
2225120,2234480," i wonder how what would be the easiest way to do that so i have to actually compare it to"
2235200,2242880," two numbers so while ws not equal zero uh what we're doing in here is essentially"
2242880,2254560," if ws equal to x we have to return uh straight up uh true right so we have to return true uh"
2254560,2260720," something like this and then i'll have to return false is there any way to simplify that it feels like"
2260720,2264960," you can simplify that but i don't want to be a smart ass about that so i'm not going to just"
2264960,2270960," simplify that i'm going to just keep it like this so all right and this is false and uh we have an"
2270960,2277520," operation that distinguishes the white spaces and uh i need to do the following thing while i is less"
2277520,2290640," than sv sv size and uh is space this entire thing is a space so sv begin uh like this we are essentially just"
2290640,2301200," increasing incrementing i uh there we go plus plus so and uh i suppose after that um what i need to do is"
2301200,2312800," sv begin plus i and sv size minus i right so that is basically it uh cool sv trim uh is space so and all"
2312800,2318560," all of these things are going to become like a part of the common module again maybe there is is alpha or"
2318560,2324960," is space or something like that but the outer completion doesn't tell me if there is uh okay so that's fine"
2326960,2335520," so the first thing we want to do here before chopping the word we want to kind of like uh sv uh trim left"
2335520,2344000," sv first and only then we want to chop a word right only then we want to chop a word that way uh we should"
2344000,2351600," be able to quite easily just just chop the ice uh i64 and get rid of this entire stuff so that should"
2351600,2359760," be it believe it or not and here we have we have to just do saved uh saved begin save begin uh so and"
2359760,2366000," i think we're done with a part one so it definitely simplified the part one uh a little bit so if i try"
2366000,2370640," to compile this entire thing it does not compile let's actually go to the compilation errors 46."
2370640,2376320," so what do we have in here so size does not exist we have to look at the sv size right so here is the"
2376320,2385520," sv size uh and uh another problem uh 75 let's go to the 75 and uh i'm not quite sure what it's talking"
2385520,2393120," about so there's nothing in 75 saved begin in part using 64 register variable i don't quite understand um"
2393120,2398400," so is that because i think i know what's going on here i forgot to make this a pointer right i forgot to"
2398400,2406880," make this a pointer okay so there's a next problem uh 85 uh so and in here oh again we just don't have"
2406880,2413920," uh you know parse word anymore so let me actually comment it out for now so i'm committing everything"
2413920,2419920," out in here and also going to comment out part uh two so the the thing i want to do in here oh okay"
2419920,2429280," so it actually hang it actually hang um that's kind of sad so uh wait a second yeah yeah it hangs uh"
2429280,2436800," unfortunately unfortunately so i made some mistakes somewhere i make a severe mistake somewhere and i'm"
2436800,2442480," not really sure where um so that is really really sus"
2442480,2452240," and now we need to understand where exactly we we did it all right so where exactly we did it it feels"
2452240,2462800," like maybe um um if i try to print this size right so let's actually go ahead and print the size and see"
2462800,2467440," so it's probably some of them are not trimming everything correctly or something like that"
2467440,2475120," uh so yeah it's probably something that so this is going to be new sv size and if i try to do that it"
2475120,2484160," didn't even print anything like at all um which is really strange so that means it hang somewhere inside"
2484160,2490560," of like a trimming process or maybe somewhere inside of the oh yeah okay of course inside of the space"
2490560,2495600," because i never incremented the space i see i see so that makes a lot of sense thank you very much and"
2495600,2501440," now it is actually working okay so that was actually relatively easy to catch i'm super happy that it was"
2501440,2509360," relatively easy to catch uh okay so it's uh 203 i want to actually like confirm that that's the problem that"
2509360,2516400," we have in here so this is the second one uh i mean that's the answer 203 okay so that's fine cool"
2516400,2522640," so next i want to port the part two right so i'm going to quickly port the part two"
2522640,2525600," so i'm going to do it like that"
2525600,2535200," uh all right so and then i'm going to basically remove this entire thing okay so let's actually start"
2535200,2542720," uh porting this thing so in here we don't need that but we do need to allocate a two uh string views uh"
2542720,2547920," sv and uh probably the word because because because we're also going to chop in the word"
2547920,2555680," so in here we're going to have sv begin and then here we're going to have sv size so this stuff is not"
2555680,2563040," needed anymore at all which is nice but we do need saved begin uh super quick so save begin and it's going"
2563040,2570320," gonna be at sv begin uh okay cool uh and then we're gonna have sv size and here it's pretty much the"
2570320,2579120," same process right it's pretty much the same process we do sv trim um trim left we trim in the the left"
2579120,2588240," part and then we do sv chop uh word we provide sv and then the word and then uh we have to chop the uh the value"
2588240,2598480," right chop chop x sv um chop i64 so it's going to be sv uh and it's going to just return x which we're"
2598480,2603920," going to assign in here right so this is going to be something like this and this is going to be something"
2603920,2613120," like this and in here i instead of n i'm going to be using sv size there we go so i suppose here i can"
2613120,2619840," also going to do sv size so that means we don't really need n anymore and i can remove it quite"
2619840,2625680," easily and i wonder if i need to remove it from the part one yeah so it never complained about unused"
2625680,2631440," variable n but maybe it is used because i suppose it is used in the end okay so that makes sense"
2631440,2635360," yeah so that's why it never complains about that because it's used in unreachable which is"
2636000,2642640," yeah which is not that important uh but it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't so here we have a"
2642640,2648960," saved begin right and here i'm gonna save everything and if i run it everything seems to be okay so we"
2648960,2656480," actually got unreachable apparently we actually got unreachable because i'm actually using sv instead of"
2656480,2661280," word i have to use the word in here and now everything's fine and i roughly remember that this"
2661280,2667520," is the correct answer uh so it's uh yeah it's roughly that okay so that's cool so we finally"
2667520,2673600," reported the second solution um right so we extracted some things that could be useful in other solutions"
2673600,2680720," like is alpha is space uh trimming left and so on and so forth so and uh let me quickly pull it out"
2680720,2689200," into the comments i wonder if i can just go into this file um i probably cannot but uh whatever um okay"
2689200,2698640," so let me see how can i bring everything up in there so probably can just bring the terminal here uh right"
2698640,2707680," aoc i'm gonna open the common stuff and uh i'm gonna go in here right so i'm gonna go in here and just"
2708480,2716640," do this thing uh all righty so this is how much code we managed to extract into the common parts"
2716640,2726160," right so a boom uh right so i'm gonna save that and i'm gonna just exit this entire thing and i'm gonna"
2726160,2733440," try to compile this one more time um so there is something weird in here why do i oh okay i forgot to"
2733440,2738400," copy paste like a single thing in there hopefully maybe the compiler will complain about that so i can"
2738400,2740560," jump um"
2740560,2743680," for"
2743680,2753600," really what are you talking about mates did i forgot to save right what what does it want for me it says"
2753600,2760480," that i'm missing semicolon at the line four ah this is because it's it included it in common and it"
2760480,2766320," actually never all right i see i see what's going on this is really really weird but it is what it is"
2766320,2773920," okay i'm gonna do common and yeah because of the error in here it complained about the error in a"
2773920,2779520," different file what a nice compiler thank you so much terry very cool uh all right so and in here i'm"
2779520,2786080," gonna open this main and uh it still complains about something in here what do you want from me didn't i"
2786080,2794720," not save common hc apparently i did not i thought i saved it okay i press ctrl s and now it should be"
2794720,2801120," fine and if i open this thing and do f5 everything is finally fine okay so we extracted a little bit more"
2801120,2809680," code into the common parts uh right so and let me quickly just go and commit them oh boy all right so"
2809680,2814560," sync into the host right so uh i probably have to provide the aoc image right"
2814560,2823840," okay so and here are the changes that we have so um yeah so this is what we extracted and then"
2823840,2828320," somewhere down below we're gonna have something that we already added cool um"
2828320,2833600," aoc"
2833600,2848880," commit move some code from day two to common right so i'm gonna commit that i'm gonna push that right into the"
2848880,2854160," repo right and if you want to get the source code of the reaper you can find it in here right if you're"
2854160,2859440," watching on youtube if you're watching live i'm gonna copy paste this thing in the chat uh right"
2859440,2868160," i'm gonna post it in the chat all righty so uh let's go um"
2868160,2877440," so we need to now uh adapt this code for the for the third problem um so let's just do this thing"
2878880,2887600," um it's gonna be run aoc 2021 there we go"
2887600,2895280," okay go"
2895280,2904240," uh two two two two oh three so this is the third one and i suppose here we're not gonna have anything"
2904240,2910960," particularly special in terms of parsing right because we only yeah we're only parsing uh the"
2910960,2914320," the numbers so this should be pretty straightforward hopefully we'll see"
2914320,2927840," so here i need to include uh c home aoc 2021 uh common h c hc and that's it so if i try to compile this"
2927840,2935680," and i think it compiles quite quite easily okay so i'm gonna remove the size uh here we're gonna"
2935680,2944000," we'll have to probably allocate just sv a single sv uh all right so this is going to be sv begin"
2944000,2946960," and then this one is going to be sv size"
2948560,2958800," so in here we don't need any of this stuff you ate saved begin uh sv begin all right so here we only"
2958800,2968400," operate on size and i'm gonna just do this stuff and uh it's going to be sv maybe something like sv"
2968400,2974960," chop i64 so i have to provide sv but this time we're parsing the binary numbers right so that means"
2974960,2980320," the radix has to be two right this time i'm providing radix uh which is nice all right so"
2980320,2985520," i'm going to save this into i think and in here i have to do saved begin right so this is going to be"
2985520,2989840," the saved begin uh and i'm going to run it and everything seems to be running okay so that that"
2989840,2994640," was actually pretty easy uh we already have a lot of code so it's pretty easy to adapt"
2994640,3000160," uh i mean a lot of code in the common right we can just reuse that code we don't have to write it from"
3000160,3011200," scratch uh sv begin uh so and then uh i'm gonna do something like sv sv sv sv begin and then sv size"
3011200,3025680," uh and here i'm gonna just do that u8 save begin sv begin all righty so and so what do we have in here"
3025680,3040800," so that should be just this uh sv chop i64 sv2 uh do we need anything else in here i think that is it"
3040800,3046480," that is everything and if i try to compile this entire thing and of course it doesn't compile because"
3046480,3057360," at 65 uh i forgot to put sv in here of course so and at 76 at 76 there was something else as well"
3057360,3065520," um so what exactly was it uh invalid l value invalid l value invalid l value sv chop i64"
3065520,3072000," so why would it be invalid l value i'm not quite sure is that because okay um"
3075440,3080880," where what"
3080880,3089520," okay let's let's read it one more time free oh okay so it's it's not here it's actually free"
3089520,3097040," but why is it complaining at 75 for like 75 and okay all right so i probably jumped in the correct place"
3097040,3103440," so it has to be saved begin all right that makes sense cool all right so we uh extracted some code we"
3103440,3108480," basically reuse some code in the third problem and i think this is all of the refactoring i wanted to do"
3108480,3113040," i wish the text editor was a little bit better because it's really painful to like move code and"
3113040,3118640," around and stuff like that uh but yeah i managed to like extract some code that could be useful in"
3118640,3122880," you know further development and as we develop more and more like patterns we're gonna just move"
3122880,3128880," those patterns into the common uh thingy and reuse them so that's basically the idea uh all right so"
3128880,3137600," let's actually go and commit uh everything we've done so let me do something like sync uh host uh aoc 2021"
3137600,3148640," so i did that all right so here are the changes uh and this is gonna be status add aoc uh git commit um"
3148640,3159520," use common uh common code in day 03 right i'm gonna push that uh right into the repo origin master"
3160160,3168560," uh all right so i think we're good to go and uh actually ready to do the fourth day hopefully so"
3168560,3175840," um let me see okay i don't know maybe i'm gonna actually split this into two videos like this is"
3175840,3181200," gonna be a video dedicated uh to developing this string view library and the next video is gonna be"
3181200,3187040," the fourth day so not just not to mash everything together i think i'm gonna do that so yeah see you in"
3187040,3188880," in the next video, I suppose."
