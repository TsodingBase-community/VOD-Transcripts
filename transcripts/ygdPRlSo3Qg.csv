320,5920," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session"
5920,11520," how about that uh so let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start the stream"
11520,21360," as usual as usual come on discord you can do that i believe in you uh red circle right uh live on"
21360,28720," twitch and what are we doing today on twitch dot at television today we are generating cellular"
29600,39760," automata uh in typescript i hope i actually spelled automata correctly uh yeah i i did it's just like"
39760,46240," the the chromium doesn't know how to spell that word either so i'm gonna give the link to twitch.tv"
46240,52240," the place where we're doing all of that and i'm gonna ping everyone who's interested in being pink"
52240,60000," and there you go the stream has officially started uh has officially started so uh as already mentioned"
60000,66640," today we are uh gonna be generating cellular automata right so what is a cellular automata probably the"
66640,75520," the most famous cell automata is conveys game of life conveys game of life so let's take a look at the"
75520,81280," conveys game of life it's it's rather famous right so you probably heard of it uh i'm gonna open the"
81280,87120," the wikipedia page right so and if you're interested in this kind of thing i'm gonna copy paste it in the"
87120,92560," chat and for people who's watching on youtube if we ever upload that to youtube i don't know it depends"
92560,97760," on the quality of today's stream uh i'm gonna put it in the in the description right so it's a conveys game"
97760,106240," of life right so you have a two-dimensional grid uh and every cell uh has two states it's either dead or"
106240,115040," alive right and there are simple rules that describe the like generation of the next state of the board"
115040,122160," right so and you basically have three rules in here if you sort of compress and reduce it so any live cell"
122160,130400," with two or three live neighbors survives any dead cell with three uh live neighbors becomes a live cell"
130400,136320," all other cells die in the next generation similarly all other dead cells uh stay dead right so this is"
136320,144160," basically sort of like a nature language description of this specific cell automaton and uh it creates a"
144160,150160," lot of interesting emerging behavior right so as you can see so it creates things like gliders right that"
150160,156880," move around and as far as i know it's been uh sort of uh demonstrated that it is turing uh turing complete"
156880,165280," um right so you basically can program in that specific uh cellular automaton uh so essentially"
165280,174480," um if we try to code these specific rules right uh it's probably gonna look uh something like uh like"
174480,182640," following right so essentially one of the things i want to try to do i want to generalize the description"
182640,189600," of the conveys game of life uh right so let's actually maybe go to turing folder and create a separate"
189600,198000," separate folder for cell automaton so i'm gonna create cell automaton uh write automaton and i'm gonna put"
198000,205360," everything in there all right and the the um language of choice for today is going to be typescript right"
205360,210720," so the uh the choice is arbitrary i just felt like programming in typescript today uh i thought it's"
210720,217440," gonna get enough viewers for today so i decided to use that personally i don't give a shit for me language"
217440,223760," is irrelevant uh for me language is just like um you know intermediate thing like i can use whatever"
223760,230320," language like i want like so i just pick whatever gives me the most amount of views for today personally"
230320,236480," i don't give a shit i hate all the languages equally and i also hate your language your favorite language"
236480,242320," yeah you're watching your favorite language i hate it but i can program in it anyway so uh"
245520,257040," uh yeah so let's actually do something uh ts right uh so essentially uh we have sort of like the current"
257040,264160," cell right so let's imagine that we have a current cell and uh that specific current cell can be either"
264160,272560," dead or alive right so it can be either dead or alive and essentially you can compute the next cell"
272560,281120," right so the next cell is undefined yet right so we can say that it is undefined uh and our goal uh is to"
281120,288000," actually compute uh the next cell given the current cell right so given the current cell right and"
288000,294080," essentially what i'm doing here we can uh switch case on the current cell right so we're switch casing on"
294080,301200," the current cell and uh if the cell is dead if the current cell is dead we're gonna do one sequence of"
301200,308720," actions and if the cell is alive we're gonna do another sequence of actions to compute the next cell right"
308720,319840," so and essentially uh depending on these states uh right um we need to look at the neighbors right"
319840,328560," so how many alive neighbors we have right so uh on top of the having like a current cell we also know the"
328560,333840," amount of uh alive neighbors right so let's actually call this variable uh something like neighbors and"
333840,339120," it's going to have some sort of a value we don't really know that value uh so maybe we can also say"
339120,344880," that it's undefined but it's something it's too specific for for javascript people may uh misinterpret"
344880,351440," what i mean in here so let's actually put like uh triple dot in here specifically right so this specific"
351440,362800," uh value cannot actually be over eight right so it's the value uh from zero to eight so that's that's"
362800,368560," the only thing we know about this uh this entire stuff and this is because it's based on neighbors"
368560,382800," right uh so we have a two-dimensional grid uh so let's actually take a look at the the gradient here"
382800,389120," let's take a look at the grid so uh we have something like this"
391760,397440," right so and the current cell is this one so the question is how many neighbors can you have in a"
397440,406800," two-dimensional grid right you can literally count them so you have one two three four five six seven"
406800,414640," eight so that means you can't have more than eight alive neighbors right so you just simply cannot have"
414640,420960," more than more than that so that's why this invariant is going to is going to hold right so maybe we can"
420960,427600," even do something like um so let's actually call it neighbors without the count so the variable is a"
427600,432080," little bit shorter because neighbors count is a little bit too long and we're going to assert that"
432080,440400," neighbors right so it's uh greater or equal than zero and neighbors is uh less or equal than eight right"
440400,444720," so this specific invariant is going to probably hold right so this is going to be very useful"
444720,453600," so if the cell is dead right so if the cell is dead uh so it becomes uh it becomes alive only when it has"
453600,461520," exactly three neighbors right so we can say something like if uh neighbors is exactly three what do we do"
461520,469120," in this specific case we say that the next cell becomes uh becomes alive right so it becomes alive"
469120,476800," otherwise it stays dead right otherwise it stays dead right otherwise it stays dead so if the cell"
476800,488160," if the current cell is uh alive right so um uh and it has fewer than two alive cells it dies right so"
488160,498240," essentially if um neighbors neighbors is less than two uh it essentially next cell uh becomes dead right"
499120,506960," it essentially becomes dead uh otherwise if um so if um so it this is specifically for underpopulation"
506960,515680," right so if if if it has too few uh neighbors as far as i know if it has uh more than three it also dies"
515680,525040," right it also dies neighbors uh greater than three uh in that case it also dies otherwise it's uh essentially"
525040,533360," uh next cell uh next cell uh it stays alive right you can kind of rewrite this entire thing you can say"
533360,543440," something like uh if the neighbors neighbors is like within uh this range right it's actually you can all also"
543440,550720," rewrite it as this all right of course because the range is so narrow you can rewrite it like this but to"
550720,557440," emphasize that it's sort of a range uh we can do something like this right so in in this specific"
557440,563200," range we're going to say that this thing is going to stay alive uh right this thing is going to stay"
563200,571520," alive otherwise it's going to become dead right and this is how you can encode essentially with the"
571520,578560," typescript code the rules of the uh of the game of life if that makes any sense right so but here is an"
578560,586880," interesting thing here is an interesting thing you sort of have a state machine in here you have a state"
586880,595840," machine and transition table right essentially you have only two states in here dead and alive uh right so"
595840,602640," you can say that the amount of states is going to be let's say something like states uh is two so that"
602640,611040," means you can encode this entire switch case as some sort of a table can't you you can kind of encode this"
611040,615920," entire thing as some sort of a table so let's actually try to do that uh all right so this is going"
615920,624240," to be const and let's call the table uh goal game of life right so this is a game of life and essentially"
624240,631920," uh when the cell is dead all right when the cell is dead uh there is another transition in here so"
631920,638400," here we can specify the amount of neighbors in case of the neighbors like three uh in case of the neighbors"
638400,644960," three uh i'm not sure how javascript works can you have uh numbers as the keys in the object i don't think"
644960,649920," so i think it has to be strings but we can actually use strings in here because it's a dynamic"
649920,653920," you know language it's a dynamic toy language so that means we can do this kind of stuff"
653920,659920," right and we can encode the next state in here so we can say that this thing is supposed to be"
659920,664960," uh alive right so we have a little bit of an inconsistency we've been using like a single quote"
664960,669360," so in here i'm using double quotes maybe it makes sense to actually replace those things like that"
670000,676320," so this is what we're gonna have so and uh maybe we're gonna have something like otherwise"
676320,685120," right so something like otherwise dead so there we go so then if we are in a life state if we are in a"
685120,693760," life state so if we uh encounter two alive neighbors right so if encounter two alive neighbors uh we're gonna"
693760,700000," stay alive if we encounter three alive neighbors we're gonna stay alive otherwise uh otherwise we uh"
700000,707360," become switched to dead right and here's the table and you can quite easily you can quite easily just"
707360,714480," switch to the next cell by uh doing something like this right so we have a current cell so we get a game of"
714480,721200," life current cell right so and by doing that we already kind of switched to one of these two tables"
721200,730080," okay that's pretty cool so then we can take amount of neighbors right and then this gives us the next"
730080,738720," sort of cell right so instead of encoding instead of encoding this huge switch case we can just have a table"
738720,744320," like this but this specific table doesn't really take into account the otherwise right so it doesn't"
744320,751040," really take into account the otherwise um so we can maybe even populate this kind of thing right so"
751040,759440," we can say like if zero uh right if zero dead if one dead and for the rest of the eight of them"
759440,766240," is going to be dead furthermore we can maybe turn this into some sort of an array right we can kind of"
766240,772960," turn it into array on on zero is going to be dead on one is going to be dead on uh two is going to be"
772960,779520," dead on three is going to be alive and so on and so forth you see what i mean right uh so we can do"
779520,787120," something like that all right and similarly here right similarly here right so this could be a table and"
787120,794960," this table kind of um removes this entire code so this entire thing could be just like this table"
795600,802000," and since this entire thing could be just a table right it could be just a table that means uh you"
802000,809920," can generate different kinds of tables what if uh here uh instead of dead you become alive you get a"
809920,817840," completely different cellular automaton right what if you have more states what if you have more state"
817840,826160," well maybe if you have dead alive and uh red right so i mean i know that better dead than red but let's"
826160,833920," imagine that we have a third one which is red so in that case we have to actually distinguish uh like"
833920,840560," the amount of neighbors of what type we have so here we count specifically alive ones but what if we have"
840560,846320," two lives and two red so maybe it's going to be like sort of like two-dimensional transition and stuff like"
846320,855040," that so as you can see you can kind of encode these cellular automatos uh with these tables and since you"
855040,862960," can encode them as tables as the data maybe you can generate them uh procedurally automatically and one of the"
862960,872800," things we can do we can maybe generate random cellular automatons and then play them simulate them for a"
872800,882400," couple of steps and uh basically find the most interesting ones you see what i mean so uh this is"
882400,887440," is actually kind of interesting isn't it so as soon as you like generalize this idea of representing the"
887440,894080," cellular automaton uh you can play with that idea furthermore okay so random seller automatons could"
894080,900720," be interesting so they may exhibit different um different behavior but what if we take an image"
900720,910400," like let's just like find some pixelated image like pixelated icon i don't know so uh open game art um"
912000,918160," open game art uh something like this let me find some stuff"
918160,931120," so icon is there any interesting pixelated icons uh this is not particularly pixelated i really want"
931120,938880," pixelated because i want um a limited amount of colors in this entire stuff something like this might work"
939520,941280," uh do we have anything else"
941280,950880," uh something oh this one is actually good this is a this is perfect this is precisely what i was talking"
950880,960240," about yeah yeah yeah yeah so can i simply open this entire thing but um i can't really open it for some"
960240,969120," reason i press uh right click and it doesn't allow me to open this entire thing probably because it it renders it"
969120,973680," in a canvas or something like that right so i can't really just like download that yeah i remember"
973680,979040," having problems with that specific website being a little bit annoying and not particularly convenient"
979600,988720," uh but yeah it is always like that so cute people oh yeah yeah cute people i just want a single image do i"
988720,993200," really have to download like the whole thing just for a single image probably have to download the whole thing"
993200,1002000," just for a single image okay so can i open fair finally oh my god so i need to also set the uh the background"
1002000,1010800," for this entire stuff uh so i don't remember back i think it's something uh i don't remember i don't remember"
1010800,1018080," i don't remember it's b black i think yeah there we go like that uh yeah so imagine"
1018080,1029280," what if we take an image right what if we take an image and here we can see okay so we have a red cell"
1030000,1036320," right we have a red cell what if we take a look at the neighboring cells and we automatically create a"
1036320,1042400," rule that says that if the neighbors uh if the amount of these specific kind of numbers is like that"
1042400,1052720," the cell stays red right the cell stays red and then we take uh you know the next image and then we"
1052720,1058800," maybe five create some sort of transitions from one image to another image and we take a lot of different"
1058800,1066320," kinds of images and we generate a cell or automaton out of that and try to play that cell or automaton"
1066320,1073200," based on like different images so we sort of like a train cell or automaton on random images and see"
1073200,1081280," what kind of behavior it will uh you know exhibit so uh i never done anything like that in fact i know"
1081280,1087200," nothing about cell or automaton automata right and i still even have a problem pronouncing this kind of"
1087200,1095120," stuff i have no idea why it is not automaton and plural automaton like in all the words in english why"
1095120,1101440," does it have to be automaton uh i have no idea so but this is sort of like an idea that crossed my"
1101440,1108720," uh my mind the other day and i wanted to try that and i thought maybe i can also uh also stream that"
1108720,1115040," right so one of the first things we'll have to do we'll probably have to implement uh the player"
1116000,1122640," for an encoding of a cellular automaton right so essentially we need to come up with like a proper"
1122640,1127600," encoding for this kind of thing this particular encoding doesn't take into account more than two"
1127600,1133840," uh states of the cell right so basically it assumes only dead and alive but here we need to have the"
1133840,1139840," transitions for different kinds of the neighbors right so and this particular thing doesn't really take"
1139840,1145680," that into account right it would be kind of nice to be able to sort of like uh generate some uh"
1145680,1151120," cellular automata and just dump them into the file system then load them up and then play them and"
1151120,1157360," also let the user to click around and just see what you can do in there right and then we'll need to"
1157360,1164240," implement the system that takes in images right and basically generates somehow somehow generates the"
1164240,1170960," cellular automata based on those images and then try to play that right so uh i think that's kind of an"
1170960,1178160," interesting idea so furthermore you can like continue sort of iterate on that idea you can notice that"
1178160,1187360," this is basically a convolution right it's a convolution of three by three what if you if you increase the"
1187360,1192800," size of the convolution what kind of other stuff you can do but it's actually too much right so if you"
1192800,1199440," never heard about convolutions i really recommend you to uh check out the video by three blue and brown uh"
1199440,1211280," three b one b convolutions right um so but what is a convolution right so let's actually find this kind of"
1211280,1221760," stuff uh yeah this one it's actually a very cool video uh i really recommend it uh okay i'm gonna"
1221760,1228880," copy paste it youtube is very slow for me right uh so i'm gonna copy paste it in the chat just for the"
1228880,1235040," the lovely people on twitch and for the lovely people on youtube uh i'm going to put this entire thing in"
1235040,1244160," here what is a convolution uh by three blue one brown but we're not gonna go into that right it's just"
1244160,1250480," something to um you know to think about in in a spare time if you're interested and the video is really"
1250480,1258480," cool i really recommend to check it out okay so uh we're gonna start by right now at least making a player"
1258880,1266720," of this specific representation of the cellular automaton right and then if we have enough time"
1266720,1274000," we're gonna continue um maybe making a generator of random cell automatons and see how they play out"
1274000,1278080," uh but it's not necessarily going to happen on today's stream maybe it's going to be like a two"
1278080,1284880," stream uh series we'll see we'll see that so anyway so i'm pretty sure people subscribed and"
1285440,1291520," donated stuff so let me acknowledge that let me acknowledge that so mishara thank you so much for"
1291520,1295920," which prime it was yesterday but i acknowledge you anyway thank you thank you thank you azure akimori"
1295920,1300320," thank you so much welcome and beats with the message cheers zozin hope you're doing well thanks for all"
1300320,1307840," the good content you're welcome i'm doing all right right uh as well as i can do as well as i can do in"
1307840,1316160," this you know in these times so the mouse 64 uh thank you so much for twitch prime uh ab code 89 uh thank"
1316160,1322960," you so much for tier one subscription and thomas 1992 thank you so much for twitch prime subscriptione"
1322960,1330400," subscriptione thank you thank you thank you and we just got another sub by evil rocket 216"
1330400,1335120," uh with the tier one subscription thank you thank you thank you really appreciate that as well"
1336240,1343520," all righty so let's go ahead and maybe start coding the the player right so the thing that will get this"
1343520,1352240," representation and we'll try to sort of play it uh okay so um how are we gonna start all of that right"
1352240,1357680," i don't remember how to do web development right why did i decide to use the typescript i don't remember"
1357680,1364640," how to do web development i'm pretty sure i have to do the npm project so let me open the the terminal and i'm"
1364640,1373600," gonna do something like this i can't even see deeper that so npm i think in it right so yeah there we go"
1373600,1379760," cell automaton so it would be better to have some sort of a name for this kind of stuff but i don't"
1379760,1384960," really know how to call this entire thing because i'm not i don't really know what exactly i'm developing"
1384960,1389200," right it's sort of an exploration process right so that's why i'm going to just call it like this"
1390000,1395600," so description entry point maybe it's going to be index.js sure i don't really care test command"
1395600,1402800," git repository we're not going to post that to repository yet author me license is going to be"
1402800,1414000," mit okay there we go we're good to go so i also want to add uh the type script uh so save dev is that how we"
1414000,1418400," do that so i want this to be like a development dependency but i also want to save it so i think"
1418400,1424720," it's a save dev if i'm not mistaken right so um"
1424720,1434240," there we go we've got some stuff we got node modules would you look at that so let's take a look at the"
1434240,1444160," size of the node modules it's 38 i haven't even started yet it's already 38 megabytes right i mean"
1444160,1450960," at least not a gigabyte you know uh at least not a gigabyte anyway so node modules and as far as i know"
1450960,1457920," you can have the type script like right in here so here's a tsc uh so this is your type script uh thank you"
1457920,1463040," so i don't quite remember like you're supposed to initialize this stuff and it will just create you the"
1463040,1468800," config file oh there we go so it did in fact create a config file nice highlighting vim"
1468800,1478720," i really like the state of web development i absolutely love it right so the the json uh"
1478720,1484960," doesn't support comments but people want to use json for configuration and that's why they put comments"
1484960,1492800," there anyway but vim supports json you know according to the standard of json and highlights"
1492800,1498720," comments as as not supported and it's just like welcome to web i suppose right so"
1498720,1506800," web people being a web people as usual uh as usual so we're gonna do all of that in the browser right"
1506800,1514960," because this is very much a visual thing we want to be able to see in this smith so that's why uh we have"
1514960,1525920," to uh create html right so let's create index html there we go so uh let's go and create an html page"
1525920,1532000," right let's create an html page does anyone remember how to program in html uh oh you can actually do it"
1532000,1541120," like that html it's xml xhtml in 2023 disgusting absolutely disgusting we're not going to do that"
1541120,1547280," so i suppose one of the things you have to do you have to do doctype html is that how we do that i don't"
1547280,1556400," freaking all right so this is going to be the head and in the title we're going to do something like title"
1557040,1569040," uh cellular uh automa automaton automaton automaton automaton right body uh right and this is going"
1569040,1577920," to be the body so we're going to create a canvas right so uh with an id uh i don't really know how to"
1577920,1584240," call this entire thing maybe we can call it app uh right so and this is the canvas so and in here"
1584240,1592240," we're gonna uh basically query a script we're gonna query js right we're gonna create js uh but we're"
1592240,1600720," going to have index ts right so i created main ts but i supposed to have index ts right so here is the"
1600720,1611040," index ts i'm gonna do something like console log uh and uh i'm gonna say hello world right hello world"
1611040,1618480," there we go we've got hello what the is this what the is this uscii art"
1618480,1630560," ah anyway so uh tsc so if i remember correctly uh tab script has sort of like a watch"
1630560,1635120," mode uh right it does have a watch mode uh right it does have a watch mode so i should be able to do"
1635120,1643920," something like node uh bin tsc uh watch right and that way it will automatically like constantly"
1643920,1650880," recompile all of my changes right and it will automatically create the index dot js so the only"
1650880,1659280," thing that typescript does it just adds use strict on top of your code apart from that it's absolutely"
1659280,1665680," the same it's absolutely the same right i could have just implemented this kind of compiler very"
1665680,1672320," easily like in five i'm joking by the way i just see it but it's the same code it's literally the same"
1672320,1677920," code it's just basically you can implement that in bash right you can implement that in bash just"
1677920,1683360," concatenate two files and there you go like why do you need like a multi-billion corporation spend a lot"
1683360,1688080," of money and time developing this i don't know it's a waste of time and money"
1688080,1701760," so we've got some we've got more subs people keep throwing money at me this is the magic of web"
1701760,1710080," technology holy fucking shit uh so the your tour thank you so much for twitch prime subscription and"
1710080,1715760," meet you and metheusf777 thank you so much for tier one subscription for 52 months holy"
1715760,1723440," fucking shit wait a second how many years is that uh so i'm gonna go to scratch i'm gonna take a 52 and"
1723440,1732640," divide it by 12 it's yeah more than four years that's pretty cool thank you so much that is in fact very"
1732640,1741440," much nice so looking forward for uh 69 month and i met thieves mx thieves thank you so much for uh"
1741440,1749040," gifting one tier one sub uh thank you thank you thank you really appreciate at that really appreciate at"
1749040,1757280," that so um all right so let me see if it actually works or not right so i'm gonna open uh this kind of"
1757280,1766880," thing in a chromium right as usual so let's do the chromium uh and i'm going to open the dev tools the dev"
1766880,1773600," a tool is uh what the oh yeah i actually put them on on the side so it's actually a very good idea"
1773600,1778480," right so i remember putting this on the side and it's yeah it's it's actually very good for for for"
1778480,1785120," the stream and there you go here's the hello world hero hello world so and let's see if the like a watch"
1785120,1792080," uh mode actually works right i'm gonna say instead of hello world we're gonna say say hello seaman right"
1792080,1800080," hello seaman and i'm gonna refresh and as you can see it says hello seaman yes now that's what i call"
1800080,1809520," an advancement in software development technology can your sea do that can your rust do that i don't"
1809520,1817280," fucking think so i just modify the code and it automatically works the fuck"
1817280,1829680," anyways so what we're gonna be doing what we're gonna be doing in here i suppose i need to query the"
1829680,1837600," goddamn canvas right i need to query the goddamn kindness so i need to do document get element by id and"
1837600,1846000," the id if i remember is called app right so this one we may want to assign it to app right and i don't"
1846000,1852960," quite remember how do you cast this kind of stuff to html canvas right so we might do something like this"
1852960,1859360," if app uh if app uh is equal to null we may want to throw some sort of error like throw a new error"
1859360,1873760," uh could not find could not find canvas uh and maybe we can uh basically do this kind of thing right canvas"
1874560,1882400," canvas id right so we may have like a canvas id and this is where we can put all of that right so"
1882400,1889600," this is a canvas id and this is an error right and that will automatically throw that specific error"
1889600,1895680," is it not poggers i think that's pretty freaking poggers uh and here we may want to actually do this"
1895680,1901360," kind of stuff so everything seems to be working so if i refresh it seems to be working if i change this kind"
1901360,1905920," of stuff to something else right it should throw an exception could not find"
1905920,1915520," right i thought this is like just like php where you have to just put curly braces i thought it's like"
1915520,1923200," php because i i thought that javascript is the modern php isn't it right uh so i suppose you have to put this"
1923200,1930800," dollar in here right imagine require requiring to put dollar in a place where even php doesn't require"
1930800,1937520," you to put a dollar just think about that php have you seen the php code right have you seen the php"
1937520,1946640," i can show you php code right so c dot php like look at the amount of dollars"
1948240,1957280," like imagine requiring to put a dollar in a place where even php even php doesn't require you to put a"
1957280,1957680," dollar"
1957680,1970400," in 2020 unthinkable like what the hell are those people thinking about i have no idea i literally have no idea"
1970400,1978560," but anyway uh so um and this seems to be working like i cannot find canvas app one all right that's"
1978560,1985760," cool very very cool uh so the next thing we probably have to do we have to create the context"
1985760,1994480," right so but that will require us to cast this entire thing to maybe something like html uh canvas element"
1994480,2001040," right so because that's what it is it's not pretty yeah it is it is a it is a canvas right and then here"
2001040,2009920," we have to get the context and the context we're going to get is 2d context right and if ctx is equal"
2009920,2020000," to null right so we're going to say something like throw new error um could not initialize 2d context"
2020000,2023920," right could not initialize to the context that's what we're going to say and here we're going to"
2023920,2033040," print ctx and print ctx and as you can see we managed to initialize this specific context so one of the"
2033040,2038880," things we probably want to do uh after we got the app maybe we want to set uh the width and height so for"
2038880,2050800," now i'm gonna set the width and height is into to 800 and 600 i suppose right height 600 uh right so and"
2050800,2057200," now if i refresh this entire stuff i'm i suppose i can no i cannot do that uh so let me let me find this"
2057200,2066800," thing and look at that it does in fact look uh like yeah so we can clearly see that uh 800 and 600"
2067600,2074400," right that's pretty powers i think that's just my opinion so what's going to be the next thing we can"
2074400,2082800," try to maybe uh clearly clear the rectangle right so we can specify this entire stop zero zero app with"
2082800,2090000," uh height but i'm not sure like can you clear with a specific color right so i know that you can have a"
2090000,2096640," uh feel style right if i say that fits the feel style is red will it fill it with red it really won't"
2096640,2101040," fill it with red and it doesn't really understand what is height uh let's actually put it in here"
2101040,2105600," yeah it doesn't really know how to do that so we have to do something like feel erect"
2105600,2112880," uh there we go so we have a red rectangle so it's that easy so you just develop web applications and you"
2112880,2119120," know what's cool about this kind of stuff it's going to work on any machine it's going to work on any"
2119120,2128240," machine so if you uh write an equivalency application right so it won't be guaranteed that it's going to"
2128240,2133440," work on someone else machine because they're gonna have uh a different operating system right so you"
2133440,2139360," wrote it for linux but what if they have windows now you have to you know if you use sdl now you have"
2139360,2145040," to ship it with a windows sdl but what if they use mac os now you have to ship it with a uh you know"
2145040,2150480," mac os sdl and it's just like not cross-platform at all but if you develop web applications"
2150480,2159280," it's going to work on any machine javascript is literally more cross-platform than c how about that"
2159280,2173120," adapt uh so i think we've got some uh some subs uh let me take a look waffle got a shame i don't know"
2173120,2178320," how to pronounce your nickname uh thank you so much for tier one subscription thank you thank you thank you"
2178320,2184080," all righty all righty all righty all righty all righty so i don't really want to have this kind of"
2184080,2191760," background right so uh let's actually put 80 80 80 right and there we go that's much better that's"
2191760,2202880," much better uh so uh maybe i'm gonna make like even the um uh the background of the whole thing also this"
2202880,2207520," uh specific uh this specific color that will be actually kind of nice but that will require to"
2207520,2213760," uh you know include some css stuff right so let's create the main css"
2215040,2222800," right and for the body right for the body we're gonna set the background to uh this specific color"
2222800,2227760," right but then how do you include the css into html i don't freaking remember"
2227760,2234560," uh right include uh css let's actually find out"
2236560,2248640," uh how to add css w3 schools w3 schools link rel would you look at that it's that easy apparently"
2248640,2256320," i didn't know that my god we're learning web development together right we're learning web"
2256320,2262160," development together isn't that epic i think it's pretty epic look at that we can't see anymore"
2262800,2269280," that's amazing but at least it's not the flashbang anymore you know what i mean at least it's it's not"
2269280,2279120," a flashbang uh right so but i also want to be able to see the um the canvas so maybe because of that i'm"
2279120,2285520," going to query replace uh query place 18 with 20 and there we go a boom a boom and now we can see"
2285520,2291120," something at least we can see the um so the boundaries of this and that stuff right so we can"
2291120,2302080," see some boundaries uh alrighty so what we need to do i need to um decide how many cells i'm going to have"
2302080,2308320," in my uh simulation and stuff like that i don't really want to have too many cells uh right so"
2308320,2314880," because if i'm going to be actually testing all of that on the cute people right if i'm going to be"
2314880,2320640," testing that all that on the cute people maybe we can say that the amount of cells we're going to have"
2320640,2331680," is 32 by 32 right so 32 by 32 uh let's go ahead and uh you know do that so we're going to have a board"
2332560,2340320," rows is going to be 32 and board board columns is also going to be 32 so this is our constants that"
2340320,2347680," we have in here uh so the next thing we're going to have uh the next thing we're going to have"
2347680,2355360," we need to decide what's going to be the cell width and cell height right so cell width and cell height"
2357120,2366800," so maybe this is going to be cell width we take the app width right and divide it by the board"
2366800,2375120," uh board columns right so the board goes and this is going to be uh the height which is basically rows"
2375120,2382640," but divided height so this is basically so i'm just dividing the in like the entire screen into the cells"
2382640,2388240," right because we're going to have cells in here uh so the next thing we want to do probably we're gonna"
2388240,2392800," maybe render them somehow right so we're gonna render them somehow how we're gonna render them"
2392800,2401760," i don't really know so we can just go since it's the same thing right since it's the same thing"
2401760,2412800," we can just like iterate so this is going to be that uh less than cell uh width plus plus i right and uh"
2412800,2422560," what we're going to do in here we're going to uh basically create the rectangle right basically create"
2422560,2430320," the rectangle but it's going to be x uh and x is basically i multiplied by cell width right multiplied"
2430320,2438960," by cell width and y is i multiplied by cell height actually this one has to be like um board rows"
2438960,2445920," right so and now we have the the coordinates of the left top uh corner of that specific cell right so"
2446560,2453520," and uh before rendering everything maybe we want to set the style to uh red yet again right so let's"
2453520,2458160," actually set it to red because i want to be able to like instantly see this entire stuff right i want"
2458160,2466480," to instantly see everything and we're going to do ctx fill a rectangle at x and y with cell width and cell"
2466480,2473840," uh height so that will fill the entire diagonal uh with uh with the cells and let's actually take a look"
2473840,2478880," look at that and there we go here is the diagonal of these specific cells isn't that cool"
2478880,2483280," uh i think that's a pretty freaking cool"
2483280,2492240," so we have a grid on which we can actually start drawing things and testing things and stuff like that"
2492240,2501120," so that's very freaking useful i think so uh here uh we have uh the similar amount of rows and columns which"
2501120,2505760," means that we can do something like that uh i want to just experiment what if i put 16 in here"
2505760,2510800," right so as you can see there is less of them so they are bigger right since there is less of them"
2510800,2517600," there are bigger and uh if i do something like 64 uh there is more of them that's why they're more fine"
2517600,2523840," uh right so the problem with this entire stuff is is that because like these things are not particularly"
2523840,2530640," square and this is because the uh the canvas itself is not particularly square one of the uh ways we can"
2530640,2535760," fix all of that is maybe by making it square i don't freaking know maybe that's one of the things we"
2535760,2540640," can do and as you can see it is square right it would be also kind of nice to have some sort of like ui"
2540640,2548480," but we can put ui outside of that specific canvas right we can put ui outside specific canvas so we have"
2548480,2554160," if we're gonna have some sort of sliders or uh maybe some things to click in here it could be"
2554160,2561520," you know basically html elements anyway so we can just keep this entire thing square anyway uh right"
2561520,2571200," so so let's actually do it like that all right that's pretty cool that's pretty cool um so it would be"
2571200,2581280," kind of maybe nice to um to be able to set the state of the board right so basically maybe i want"
2581280,2586560," to be able to click uh on this entire stuff right maybe i want to be able to click on this entire stuff"
2586560,2593520," and where i clicked it would set the uh the corresponding um you know state of the of the cell"
2593520,2599920," so that's one of the things we probably want to do but to be able to do that we need to handle the"
2599920,2608720," um the click right so we need to handle the click uh how we're going to be handling the click uh so"
2608720,2616560," um add event listener maybe maybe we can uh you know add event listener and event listener is a"
2616560,2625040," basically so key extend html element event map that's actually pretty interesting uh my emacs just"
2625040,2633680," literally died i was trying to jump to html element event map there we go right uh maybe i can just take"
2633680,2639200," a look at that stuff full uh global event handers what kind of stuff we can have in here we can have"
2639200,2647440," a click right so that's pretty cool so that means i can do a click all right and in here we can do"
2648000,2660800," uh console log uh as far as i know you can um accept html this thing and the the html element event map"
2660800,2669440," right so that means i can take the event and i can put it into logs so that means if i click on here"
2669440,2677360," yeah as you can see so i actually receive the events in here right so after that we can try to see what"
2677360,2683680," kind of information do we even have in here so there is several um coordinates in here there is a client"
2684240,2692880," uh coordinates there is offset uh and there is a page and stuff like that uh so i think the thing that we"
2692880,2699520," care about is the client x and client y i think that's the only thing we care uh right so maybe i'm"
2699520,2709440," gonna actually do something like this client uh and here we're gonna put it like that e client x maybe"
2709440,2718960," i'm gonna even put it into an array uh client y i wonder if it's going to work let's actually find out"
2718960,2729040," there we go so i want to see so this is actually very close to zero and this uh i can't it's kind of"
2729040,2735440," very close to yeah original size and as far as now it's gonna stay like that regardless of sort"
2735440,2740880," of like the zoom right it's gonna stay like that regardless of the zoom uh i can't really see what's"
2740880,2746480," going on but one of the things i want to see okay so i sort of zoomed in very very much and if i click"
2746480,2757600," click in here um it stays that's very interesting so i suppose client is like oh yeah i see it's literally"
2757600,2764960," the client window client is literally like this visible client window holy"
2764960,2774480," i see so yeah that's pretty cool okay so that means the client is not what we need"
2774480,2780560," client is not what we need let's try something else right so let's see what other other things we have in"
2780560,2794320," there right so right means it's not what we need uh okay layer x page maybe page right so maybe page is"
2794320,2803840," what we need so let's quickly uh do something like this page uh and let me see so i want this to be sort of like"
2803840,2811760," independent from uh the zooms and stuff like that so if now i sort of do something like this right"
2811760,2819680," and it is 80 80 in here look at that it's actually more than that which is a bit weird"
2820320,2823200," right which is tiny bit weird but i suppose"
2823200,2835520," yeah yeah this is not this is not what we want to have in here uh right so maybe this thing is like on"
2835520,2842480," the page right so it is on the page so essentially yeah yeah so there is a 10 pixel padding in here"
2842480,2848720," right there is a 10 pixel padding and uh that's why it sets it like that right so this is actually"
2848720,2854400," very educational right this is actually very educational i think in my opinion uh right and"
2854400,2865120," for instance if in html i add something like h1 right it is not going to work right so cellular"
2866400,2876160," automata right so yeah there we go so we have some stuff in here uh which is in black so you probably"
2876160,2882880," want to actually make it like bright so we can see it main.css and i think the foreground is it just"
2882880,2889200," foreground is it foreground i don't quite remember but i'm going to say white uh no it's not called"
2889200,2898880," foreground is called color yeah css that's why i'm not a web developer like why the background"
2898880,2904400," core called background but foreground is called core because because it's stacked because you it's not"
2904400,2910960," really clear what exactly do you mean by foreground right that makes sense i suppose uh yeah that kind"
2910960,2917520," of makes sense right and again right so here uh since i added some stuff in here the actual why"
2917520,2922480," is going to be like not 10 but 67 because it will include this entire stuff so it means"
2922480,2927600," uh the page is also doesn't work for us right the client doesn't work because it's like literally"
2927600,2934880," visible window visible window uh you know view page is literally on the page but it could be anywhere on"
2934880,2941040," the page so we need something else right so there's too many coordinates in here uh so screen i'm not"
2941040,2949680," really sure if this screen so there is x and y i suppose maybe x and y is what we are looking for uh right i"
2949680,2960480," have a feeling uh that x and y is the thing we're looking for okay just x and y right just x and y can i"
2961360,2971600," select these two things and just there we go can we do that i don't think so uh no this is also not correct"
2971600,2974880," this is also not correct"
2978960,2990400," and yeah yeah so this is not right because uh it still looks in there okay uh i remember having"
2990400,2996880," problems with the coordinate of this entire thing so uh what are the there is a layer"
2998880,3009840," uh maybe it's offset i think it is offset boys and girls i think it is offset because it's offset from"
3009840,3015520," the from the current position so that makes sense that's actually makes sense and this is something"
3015520,3021840," that i was actually not considering as the you know the real thing that we probably need uh right"
3023200,3030720," okay let me see let me see let me see so now it is yeah that is basically what i want that is actually"
3030720,3042240," what i want i think yeah that is very very close to to my thing yeah yeah perfect so we're gonna be"
3042240,3054160," using offset that's what we're gonna be using very cool so um once we got that uh we can quite easily"
3054160,3062640," right we can quite easily determine where exactly we clicked right so here we have x uh so this one"
3062640,3072000," probably has to be uh offset x then y then y there you go uh so but then if we divide these"
3072240,3080480," offset by cell width we actually get the cell on the two uh on which we clicked right we actually get"
3080480,3085920," the cell on which we click but it's we actually get the column of that thing right so but since it's um"
3085920,3093040," you know all of the numbers in uh in javascript are floating point right so since they're floating"
3093040,3099840," point uh that means we also have to floor this entire stuff right uh because this language doesn't really"
3099840,3105760," have integers unless we're talking about web assembly and stuff like that and things like big int right"
3105760,3112160," if i remember correctly there is big int in javascript right so i wonder if i can jump there i can't really"
3112160,3118720," jump there okay so the situations with numbers in javascript is a little bit complicated in my opinion"
3120080,3123920," right so in here we have to do something like height"
3123920,3135040," all right so this is row cool and uh so essentially if we had some sort of a board right if we had some"
3135040,3143360," sort of a board uh we could try to access that board like so right so column and row uh and maybe set its"
3143360,3148480," state to something like a life right something like life"
3148480,3161440," but uh we don't really have that we don't really have that board and question is is there any easy way"
3161440,3170480," to create a board right so um i remember something like array uh had had a from i think"
3171360,3173440," yeah look at those new lines"
3173440,3184240," this is do you guys know what those things are do you guys know what these things are these are slash r's"
3184240,3191520," these are slash r's this is how like a windows file looks like when you open it"
3191520,3198640," with unix encoding and stuff like that so you can clearly see that this was developed by microsoft yes"
3201280,3208320," mm-hmm windows files ah imagine using windows in 2023"
3208320,3220960," but dog food am i right you guys know what is dog food right dog food testing"
3225760,3237120," uh wikipedia where is wikipedia i need a wikipedia page none of that yeah for dog food testing yeah it's in"
3237120,3243440," your own dog dog food right it's essentially testing by literally using your product daily"
3243440,3250320," dog fooding right so that's dog food testing that's that's probably why they were using windows"
3251680,3255760," they probably don't want to use windows nobody wants to use windows but i mean"
3255760,3262000," since you're microsoft uh you you kind of have to do that uh anyway so um"
3262000,3269600," return a new array of a set of elements and i want to how can you just generate an array"
3269600,3278080," that's a good question right so one of the way i would personally do that right so i don't know the the"
3278080,3283440," official way of generated an array right so but i would do something like this right so i'm going to"
3283440,3292240," be iterating uh the rows right uh actually we're going to be iterating the rows uh zero less than board"
3292240,3298960," rows right board rows plus plus i maybe i'm going to even call i row"
3300640,3306480," right i'm going to call the row then i'm going to be iterating the columns right then i'm going to be"
3306480,3317200," iterating the columns so this is course and uh to be fair i don't really want to take away such a good"
3317200,3324560," name right i'm going to call it r and i'm going to call this thing c and this is because i want to create"
3325200,3332320," uh a row literally a variable row and i'm going to be iterating each individual column and in here"
3332320,3337440," i'm going to be appending i don't remember yeah i push i'm going to be pushing zero in here or maybe"
3337440,3345200," something like uh something like dead right so i'm pushing a row i'm creating a row and i'm not going"
3345200,3351360," i'm going to be pushing that row into the board is there any better way of uh generating an array"
3352880,3358640," i have no idea right so let's actually confirm that this entire thing works i'm going to do console"
3358640,3367120," uh log board does that work right so so just in case we have like a backup plan um so variable board"
3367120,3373120," implicitly has type any oh yeah okay so that that makes sense so can i say uh that the type of this"
3373120,3387280," entire thing is an array um right array of array of strings right we can even probably introduce a type"
3387280,3397280," uh state where we could say alive or dead right and that way we can say okay so this is a basically a board"
3399040,3404400," right something like that so and that will basically type check it at compile time hopefully"
3404400,3415440," uh right so and in here uh we need to say array state array state and it does in fact uh compile"
3415440,3418960," it does in fact compile so it actually refers this entire stuff and we've got this stuff"
3418960,3425200," we've got this stuff so it's 32 by 32 so it in fact works but maybe there is a better way so let's"
3425200,3430560," actually find out javascript uh generate array how do you generate that way"
3430560,3437440," uh how do you generate array array constructor okay so"
3437440,3445200," so you can create that array length okay oh"
3447760,3457840," you can just specify array length you can just specify array length that's pretty cool"
3457840,3467120," but can i feel it with something so is there something because i feel like if i just specify"
3467120,3472240," the array length if i just do new array"
3474000,3483200," uh 10 right it is going to yeah it creates like an empty uh an empty thing right so that means you need"
3483200,3485920," to fill it up already feel"
3485920,3493280," so there is a few which is nice"
3495280,3503760," uh let's take a look uh let's take a look try it uh-huh feel value start end"
3503760,3506640," to"
3506640,3517680," um you can fill it with the value but what's what start uh zero based index at which to start feeling"
3518480,3526880," oh so does that mean i can do something like um let me see array fill"
3526880,3538720," zero from zero to nine does that create yeah okay i see i see what's going on so"
3540160,3552400," you have to do um you have to do like um array it's so slow for me right new array"
3552400,3563840," why is this something maybe it's something with my chromium actually uh fill with empty"
3569120,3574800," uh this is because of this stuff right it just like generated too many of these things"
3574800,3580720," and it's just like it's having a stroke for me all right so and again i'm using like a 10 years old"
3580720,3588000," laptop right so and uh apparently it's impossible to just create a bunch of arrays on the 10 years old"
3588000,3592640," laptop you literally have to have like a what is it called the supercomputer to do that"
3594480,3604320," anyways anyways anyways uh so that means we can uh basically create this stuff with just array row"
3604320,3614320," uh right board calls and just fill it with dead right so we can just fill it with that and that way"
3614320,3620160," we can illuminate this thing right so that also means that by doing that we can illuminate this stuff"
3621360,3627600," those greatly simplify this entire thing but i don't think we can get rid of this part right so"
3627600,3633280," because i feel like if i just do the feel for the board right if i just do the feel for the board"
3633280,3640960," it will essentially just have uh it won't it won't clone the array right so it won't clone the array"
3640960,3648720," i feel like you you have to do it like that uh right so but maybe feel accepts an a function that it may call"
3648720,3654080," but uh i don't know maybe it does accept the function maybe it doesn't really matter"
3654080,3660160," oh here is an example okay so literally literally what we just wrote right so that's sort of like the"
3660160,3668240," official way of creating multi-dimensional array right so we confirm that uh so uh this is the official"
3668240,3675840," way of creating a multi-dimensional array uh so because mozilla even uh confirmed that okay cool"
3675840,3685200," so that's very very cool um and we can actually now use that specific board right that specific board"
3685200,3693760," to fill up this entire stuff right so essentially as we iterate through um so all of this board i suppose"
3694400,3699760," uh we can even do it like that so this is going to be row this is row this is row and then we're going"
3699760,3707040," to be iterating the columns uh the columns columns columns there we go i don't really want to remove"
3707040,3717040," this entire stuff so and depending on whether it's alive or dead right so if board row uh column uh row and"
3717040,3725120," column equal to column equal to alive only then right only then we're going to be trying to render anything"
3725120,3731920," in here so but instead of using i we're going to be using r and c actually c and r right c and r and"
3731920,3739360," then we're going to be just doing it like that there we go so that's how we are uh rendering this entire stuff"
3740400,3746560," uh and then so that should be enough actually believe it or not so that should be it uh and that"
3746560,3752720," should enable us to actually click on those things and update it but we can't update it because"
3752720,3760880," uh we do not redraw we do not redraw the entire scene so the thing we need to do now the thing we need"
3760880,3767600," to do now we need to take this entire code and factor it out to a function something like coranda"
3768240,3776080," something like render right and let's actually put it above the click right and every time we click"
3776080,3781920," and every time we update this entire thing we're going to be re-rendering this entire stuff uh right"
3781920,3789600," and let's actually do the first render uh so the user can see what the fuck is going on right so in here"
3789600,3795360," we have that that and that everything seems to be okay and now if i click something as you can see it is"
3798080,3806240," right so in terms of uh x i suppose yeah so we're getting somewhere as you can see we're getting"
3806240,3815920," somewhere isn't that cool first try i don't really know what is going on but i mean it kind of worked"
3815920,3819600," right not exactly as i wanted uh but yeah"
3822160,3830480," not exactly as i wanted but it worked to some extent so let me try to understand so we're iterating"
3830480,3836800," the rows right iterating the rows iterating the columns and for each column i multiply the width"
3836800,3845120," by that and roll by that we calculate x and y and we just do that uh so all right so maybe we're generating"
3845120,3852640," the board incorrectly i'm getting iterating this stuff and i'm filling it up with dead so that should be"
3852640,3863360," correct uh more or less that should be correct so the only problem is probably within the offset"
3863360,3873920," right we're using the offset uh right so x divided by width and then we floor it so that gives us the column"
3874960,3883520," uh-huh i see what's going on so because the first one is a row yeah that's the mistake i've made"
3883520,3890880," i fucked up the coordinates so now if i do something like this would you look at that yo what the"
3890880,3900880," fuck i can now set the state of this entire shot what the fuck isn't that cool first try by the way first"
3900880,3911200," try easy peasy lemon squeezing that's the power of web development can your native application do that so"
3911200,3921120," fucking easily so i don't think so uh anyway so i don't really like that it's red all right and it's"
3921120,3926080," like very bright red if you know what i mean it's very bright red so i want to make it a little bit"
3926080,3932960," less harsh right so by maybe making it like 50 50 in here right so yeah as you can see it's a little bit"
3932960,3941920," less harsh it's still red uh it's still red but it's less harsh right so that's pretty progressive"
3941920,3952480," uh so uh that means we can actually do all of that so interestingly it would be maybe nice to have"
3953760,3962720," an association an association uh between the state and the caller right and since we're going to have"
3962720,3968960," like uh multiple different states we're not necessarily going to have like two states we may"
3968960,3976400," have three states we have four states uh it would be better to actually use um state as a number in my"
3976400,3984800," opinion right i think state as a number is a little bit better right i think state as a number is a"
3984800,3991840," little bit better um and then we could have an association right so an association something like"
3991840,4002480," uh state uh state colors right state colors uh and it's going to be an array uh and in here uh"
4002480,4010240," right so where is the background so it's a 2020 so the zero the first state always going to be uh going"
4010240,4017760," to be like a background then the next one is going to be the red one uh right so and then if we're going"
4017760,4023200," to have three states in the future if we're going to have three states in the future we may set uh the"
4023200,4032000," third one to be green and then the next one could be uh blue right if we need more um states in the"
4032000,4039120," future i will extend this sort of like a um color table right so i will extend this color table so"
4039120,4045120," the cool thing is that we're using statically typed compile language which means uh what i need to do i"
4045120,4049920," just need to go through the compilation error so as far as i know in emacs i can uh like i turn on"
4049920,4057120," the fly check mode right and it should kind of work it should show me the places where i have to fix"
4057120,4066640," things but it doesn't really show me that so can i just do something like uh bin tsc uh it's a dot bin"
4066640,4075040," tsc can i just run it and it show me the all of the compilation errors it should show yeah there we go so"
4075040,4082960," we can just go there there we go so here it doesn't have an access to ctx which is rather strange why is it"
4082960,4086320," complaining about that oh ctx is possibly null"
4086320,4094080," i mean"
4094080,4098800," really so in here"
4098800,4108400," hoisting oh i see so maybe we could accept yeah it's probably because of the hoisting um"
4110640,4118640," so rendering context to these so uh we're gonna accept this kind of stuff so let's put c to x like"
4118640,4123840," that uh and then so it also complains about the board"
4123840,4131680," also complaints about the board um we can also accept the board"
4134640,4143680," and uh we can even do something super cool we can say that the board as a type is array of array"
4143680,4152000," of the states and i wonder can i actually uh basically say that the array is something like this"
4152000,4160240," is that a better way of describing that i think it is i think it kind of is so then then later i can say"
4161120,4166320," uh something like this so this is a board and it still doesn't really like that"
4166320,4172640," uh oh yeah it's something like uh this"
4176480,4186640," yo typescript muster typescript muster okay absolutely freaking epic absolutely freaking epic"
4186640,4192320," uh okay so let me try to recompile this entire stuff is it going to complain it's probably going"
4192320,4197040," to complain because now all the calls to render are also up so i need to go through them"
4197680,4205200," uh right board uh what you don't like this comparison appears to be yeah there we go so here is the thing"
4205200,4212720," uh since i now uh stepped away from the conveys game of life states right dead and alive"
4212720,4219440," right what i have to do i just have to render the colors right so i can do state colors take the board"
4220640,4229120," put it in here and here is my color and so i can set that specific feel style uh that specific feel"
4229120,4236080," style and just feel this entire thing uh like that right i don't really care about the specific states"
4236080,4243840," anymore right i have an association between the number of the state and the color right uh and the"
4243840,4250720," color so i don't have to worry about that stuff anymore so that's pretty pogors uh so what else do"
4250720,4260080," we have in here uh all righty so it complains oh yeah this one uh we just set it to a life let's"
4260080,4265840," actually set it to one so here is the render and we have to set it to what render accepted i forgot it"
4265840,4273600," accepts ctx and the board right in here we're also going to accept ctx and the board that's pretty"
4273840,4283600," cool cool and i suppose it is going to work right it is going to work and it's really weird"
4283600,4290960," right because it filled everything up oh okay"
4290960,4296000," freaking"
4303200,4305200," why didn't type check that"
4305200,4311360," type script my ass"
4311360,4318160," statically typed compile language"
4318160,4331440," swear to god why didn't type check that like what the is this like why it even why because okay so i"
4331440,4337120," suppose what i had to do is just put state in here right and then it will complain it in here"
4337120,4344640," but why you didn't complain it when i was trying to put array of any into push oh because you you can't"
4344640,4354080," do that i see i see so essentially they preserve any for backward compatibility with with existing like"
4354080,4360000," javascript uh code bases and stuff like that so you can take any and assign it to anything i suppose"
4360000,4365520," right right and that's why how we managed to get away with all of that i see god damn it"
4365520,4376320," type script my ass truly uh anyway so that's how we have to do that to be a little bit more type"
4380320,4388160," um so i can disable this behavior and i'm too lazy can i can i just do that in the ts config any"
4388160,4394720," no implicit any enable error reporting"
4394720,4398800," uh no i don't want to actually spend some time on that"
4400240,4407600," yeah there we go so that's pretty cool all right so uh we already been streaming for one hour right and"
4407600,4412960," after one hour i would like to make a small break and make a cup of tea right because i've been slapping"
4412960,4420720," some code for one hour it's been stressful i need to release that stress by drinking some tea by drinking"
4420720,4428240," some tea that's how i relieve my stress so uh let's make a small break and all right so uh let's continue"
4428240,4435920," so what was the next thing uh i don't quite remember already uh so i suppose one of the things we probably"
4435920,4443920," need to do is to compute the next state of the of the board right so we have the current board right"
4443920,4450720," we have the current board and we need to compute the next one which means i usually compute the next"
4450720,4458480," one by having the second board right so i have a like a current board and the next one and uh essentially"
4458480,4465680," i compute the next uh the uh from the current board into the next one and i just swap them around"
4466160,4471520," right if you know what i mean i just swap them around um and that means i need to be able to"
4471520,4476160," to create a second board right so i need to be able to create a second board so maybe we're going to have"
4476160,4485440," some sort of a function uh called create board right so uh create board and we're going to move this"
4485440,4492800," entire stuff in here right so uh here we uh return something i don't remember how do you specify the"
4492800,4499760," return type i suppose it's something like this uh right so and in here we're going to be doing"
4499760,4507520," something like uh board uh this is the board and this is stuff and then we just return that specific"
4507520,4516080," board there we go so then uh i have the board right so and i create uh the board like so uh and then i can"
4516080,4520800," have like uh so this is the current board this is the current board and i can have the next board"
4520800,4527280," so this is the things that i can have in here all right this is this thing that that i can have in"
4527280,4538960," here um so in here right we just do uh current board we just set it like that this is the current board and"
4538960,4546160," and then we render the current board okay that's actually pretty pretty good uh it works out quite"
4546160,4553840," well i would say uh maybe i would like to move the creation of those boards a little bit closer to"
4553840,4561920," where we use them like a render thing and the click thing uh all right so the next thing i would like to have"
4561920,4570480," to have is to uh compute the next board right uh so um how can i call that i want to call it next board"
4570480,4577200," but unfortunately i already have the name next board uh right i should probably use this kind of stuff"
4577200,4583040," right uh i should probably use this kind of stuff so maybe i should call it compute next board right"
4583040,4592240," compute uh next board uh right and in here we're gonna accept the the board the initial board um the"
4592240,4597920," current and the next one all right we're not going to return anything because we're taking the current"
4597920,4603760," board and we're computing it into the next one uh all right and in here we're gonna just iterate"
4603760,4612080," through the rows and columns as usual right row uh board rows plus plus r so then we're gonna have the"
4612080,4623760," columns uh like so calls uh huh and uh i'm gonna just like do the usual switch case right the usual switch"
4623760,4629760," case and uh then we're gonna factor it out into the table that we discussed at the beginning of the"
4629760,4638400," stream right so uh we're gonna have the following stuff so i want to say specifically that this is"
4638400,4645120," not just a generic compute next uh next board it's more of like a compute the next board goal right for"
4645120,4652480," specifically game of life and in a game of life we're gonna assign the dead cell to be zero and the alive"
4652480,4662240," cell to be one uh right so essentially the state is just a number it's just like any number and"
4662240,4671040," specifically for that specific uh um cell or atomaton we consider zero to be dead and one to be alive"
4671040,4678400," right but different encoding may use different uh different states differently right so we don't really"
4678400,4684720," imply any meaning like associated with number it's just like depends on the cellular automaton right uh"
4684720,4693440," and we have predefined colors for different states uh in here right so for zero we predefined uh the"
4693440,4699840," background color for one we predefined red for two we predefined green and for uh three we're"
4699840,4706800," predefined blue we can predefined even more of them if we need to right so basically uh the state is just like a"
4706800,4713520," number right so how you interpret that number is up to the creator of that specific cell or automaton right"
4713520,4720400," so this is just a framework uh right so that's basically how how i see that all right so this is"
4720400,4727200," the row this is the column and in here specifically i wonder if we can do this thing i wonder if it will"
4727200,4736320," work we will find out uh right and then we're gonna have a life and also break right in case of the dead"
4736320,4748560," we become alive when we become alive when we become alive when we have exactly three neighbors if i"
4748560,4757520," remember correctly uh right so let's actually count the neighbors count neighbors uh but what's interesting"
4757520,4765360," is that uh again we can have uh several states so this particular function that count neighbors for the"
4765840,4772880," uh for the board board uh for the board board at row r and colon oh well i mean it's not an int it's a"
4772880,4785600," number right uh all right we have to return probably an object right that essentially says okay for um"
4786960,4798080," for state you have for state you have sort of like five of state zero and one of state one or something like"
4798080,4807840," that that's kind of like the idea if you know what i mean uh right because of that"
4809440,4819440," we could return the neighbors as an array as an array of numbers right so and each index is going to"
4819440,4825760," indicate how many of those specific things we have in there right how many of those specific things we"
4825760,4837760," have in there right so but it's kind of difficult to represent all of that because uh we don't know how"
4837760,4847520," many state states we have up front right so with the board right the board may not have all of the states"
4847520,4854800," that that are possible in there you know what i mean so maybe one of the things we want to pass in there is"
4854800,4860720," also the amount of states uh right maybe one of the things we want to pass in there is the amount of states"
4861520,4871040," or maybe we can actually pass this thing as an argument as well does it make sense why uh why"
4871040,4877360," i have a problem in here right or not really have a problem but why i rattle about this specific thing"
4877360,4885520," for for so much you know what i mean uh does it make sense because it's a very subtle transition"
4885520,4891040," and i'm a little bit afraid that not everyone can pick it up right so essentially in"
4891680,4898240," conveys game of life we're always talking about the amount of a live cell right so the cell becomes"
4898240,4907920," like basically becomes from dead to uh alive when there is exactly three uh alive neighbors but if you"
4907920,4916480," have three alive numbers that just means that you have five dead numbers so we omit the amount of dead"
4917200,4923280," neighbors because we only have two states and the dead sort of doesn't really matter as soon as you"
4923280,4931360," have more states where you're starting to talk about like um two red neighbors and three green neighbors"
4931360,4937520," and so on and so forth so you you actually have like more different kinds of name uh neighbors right and"
4937520,4944720," that is just only one of them and i'm trying to create sort of like a general framework where we return"
4945360,4954720," an array that describes okay you have uh five amount of zeros like two amount of like ones and one twos"
4954720,4961280," right so and that it should be um you know usable for a game of life in case of a game of life we're"
4961280,4968480," gonna just ignore the dead cells but for other uh you know cell automatons it might be important does it"
4968480,4973520," make sense i'm just like a little bit afraid that it might not make sense right because it's a very subtle"
4973520,4977040," sort of transition right does it make sense um"
4977040,4984640," that's just one array of the frequencies of the kinds of things yeah yeah thank you yes that's that's"
4984640,4988400," what i'm talking about yeah yeah so i'm just like making sure that we're on the same page"
4988400,4997600," um okay so and uh yeah that's actually a good name frequency so maybe i should like use the word frequency"
4997600,5007120," somewhere in the in here right so essentially uh i can specify the amount of different states within the"
5007120,5014480," current cellular automaton through this array so essentially if i have five states what i do i just"
5014480,5022960," pass the uh i just pass an array of five elements and that's how this entire thing sort of knows uh how to do"
5022960,5029760," of that right so uh and uh how we're going to be counting the the neighbors right so the usual way"
5029760,5037040," i like to count the neighbors i already talked about many times is just that uh i have uh right so"
5037040,5044160," just let me actually put this kind of stuff right so here's the current cell uh right so this is the"
5044160,5050400," the current cell and i need to go through all of the neighbors uh but we have a three by three square"
5050400,5056320," so what we essentially do and we're just iterating three by three and ignoring the center one right and"
5056320,5063680," that's exactly what i want to do in here uh right so i need to start iterating um so i'm going to be"
5063680,5070880," iterating actually with dr so it's a delta r uh right so it's a delta r it starts from minus one"
5071680,5081520," delta r equal one uh right plus plus dr and we're gonna repeat this entire stuff for c dc dc there we"
5081520,5091360," go uh right and we're going to ignore all of that when dr is equal to zero and dc is equal to zero"
5091360,5096960," but we need to negate that right so that means we're going to apply at the morgan law which means"
5096960,5103280," that we're going to negate the equals and we're going to change the uh conjunction to disjunction"
5103280,5113120," right so if this is true uh all right we are going to uh try to access the neighbors so uh this is more"
5113120,5119360," of a like this is a center right so let's actually call them uh r zero and c zero and we're going to"
5119360,5129760," create r which is r zero plus dr and c which is c zero plus uh dc right and this is the coordinate of"
5129760,5135040," one of the neighbors right so r and c is the coordinate of one of these things excluding the"
5135040,5140480," center because we excluded the center in here but there is another problem in here is that r and c could"
5140480,5145600," be outside of the uh of the boundaries of the board right so this is something that we have to check"
5145600,5156480," so if r uh right zero equal r and r is less than board uh rows all right and the same goes for the uh"
5156480,5166000," for the columns right the same goes for the columns same goes for the columns only then uh we can safely"
5166000,5175280," access r and c and since it contains the state that can be used also as an index with the neighbors"
5175280,5180720," we can just do it like that and that way we basically counted all of the neighbors in here"
5180720,5190160," so yeah we can do some stuff where uh maybe we clean up the neighbors all right so we fill them with zero"
5191760,5198640," up front all right but essentially yeah so that actually makes makes it super easy to count the"
5198640,5211920," neighbors right super super easy all right so in here uh we get the we compute stuff for the current"
5211920,5217920," for the current cell right so we do but we need to probably create the neighbors somehow so let's create"
5217920,5226960," neighbors uh const new array and we need to know how many states we have right so we don't really know"
5226960,5231680," how many states we have in here so i'm going to actually pass the amount of states as an argument"
5231680,5238880," right so this is going to be states uh states number right and that way we're going to just create the states"
5239760,5246480," uh and we're going to fill all of them with uh zero right so and these are neighbors uh compute"
5246480,5254800," so count neighbors i'm going to actually take this entire stuff put it in here so as the board as the"
5254800,5264320," board we're using current as the neighbors we're using that and uh we just use r r and c there we go so"
5264320,5275200," this is how we counted the neighbors right so we counted them in here cool uh in case of the uh dead if we're dead"
5275200,5283280," and we become alive only when it's exactly equal to three so that means i can take neighbors and take a"
5283280,5294800," look at the alive numbers uh neighbors right so they're equal to three uh the next rc the next rc becomes uh"
5294800,5306640," alive right otherwise the next stays uh dead as it was right that's pretty cool so uh then neighbors"
5307440,5320800," a life equal to two or uh equal three uh we stay alive right we stay alive otherwise we dead"
5320800,5330640," there we go so that's the whole thing that computes the next uh stuff uh for this thing oh yeah triple"
5330640,5337280," equals of course but i mean i wonder if the if typescript will tell me yeah type script is"
5337280,5342400," closed it's probably going to tell me it's going to tell me like a lot of things uh in here so"
5342400,5350960," oh so slow okay so we have a current board uh and uh i actually call it current board"
5353760,5355600," so this is the current board"
5355600,5360080," all right"
5360080,5364880," i want to organize"
5364880,5373520," um sort of like a way to compute the next state if you know what i mean right it would be nice to have"
5373520,5381920," some sort of a lebaton you know lebaton that you can can press to to compute the next state or something"
5381920,5391920," like that so let's create a lebaton uh so if i remember lebaton is an input right um so input"
5391920,5399920," and uh the type is i think submit so it's a very submissive uh you know input type and then the value"
5399920,5407680," is uh is the basically the text of this thing i think i'm not i'm not a web developer so i don't"
5407680,5412800," fucking know and it doesn't work right so uh oh yeah this is a fucking"
5412800,5422960," fucking web i swear to god uh yeah so we have to maybe like put it as a block or something like"
5422960,5433680," that uh all right so we have a next all right so uh we have a lebaton uh lebaton so as an id uh i'm"
5433680,5438240," gonna call it a next right so because we want to be able to get the next thing here"
5438240,5452560," so these days people tell me that these days you can just do button what kind of zoomer is that"
5452560,5458800," you know i've been doing web development since internet explorer 6 and i'm not joking by the way"
5458800,5465440," an ironically was doing web development since that i'm a veteran web developer don't tell me how to do it"
5465440,5468960," okay let's actually try button i mean why not"
5468960,5484480," not only been doing web development since internet explorer 6 i was also developing extensions"
5485200,5490080," for internet explorer 6 so it can support some features that are not in the web standard or"
5490080,5495120," something like that yes i've been and ironically doing this kind of stuff as well i've been doing"
5495120,5502720," a lot of you know shady in my entire life so uh can i just put some like next in here is it going to work"
5502720,5507760," holy it works uh next is your mom"
5509120,5519920," yeah so let's make sure so can i put id uh in here next yeah okay we can use that"
5519920,5530240," thank you all right so here we are getting the canvas right and so the next thing we probably want to do is"
5530240,5542480," is to get the libaton yeah libaton const next id is just next and uh we need to do document uh get we're"
5542480,5550320," not using any react framework in here as i already said i'm a veteran web developer i don't need no shady"
5550320,5557040," frameworks i can do everything in vanilla js do have you heard about vanilla js framework"
5557040,5560560," vanilla js framework"
5560560,5569600," yo have you heard about that yes i'm using this framework"
5569600,5578720," have you heard about vanilla js framework check it out yes that's the only framework you will ever need"
5579280,5594000," uh http by the way right i'm gonna also put it in the description uh so vanilla js framework"
5594000,5600320," yes okay so next id"
5600320,5607760," uh next id so what do we need to have in here uh next"
5608960,5614880," okay and i suppose what i want to do in here is uh check if we manage to get that next"
5614880,5625760," throw new error right could not find the button button how do you spell i don't know but"
5625760,5635680," next id uh right and how can i cast it uh can i do something like as html"
5637520,5643200," button element yo you can have a button element isn't that poggers i think it's pretty freaking"
5643200,5648560," poggers uh so let's actually uh try to print this and i think i just want to see if i have an access to"
5648560,5656800," all of that uh yep here is the lebaton here's the lebaton we've got lebaton uh so and i suppose"
5656800,5668320," what i can do what i can do i can just do um next right next add event listener click and we're gonna just"
5668320,5678720," put this kind of stuff in here uh console look uh next is your mom right and let's see if it's going to work"
5682720,5690800," it works about that it works so the thing we want to do in here we want to actually compute the next"
5690800,5696880," board right so we want to compute the next board the amount of states we have in here is two uh right"
5696880,5703040," we take the current board and we'll compute all of that into the next board right and uh the next thing"
5703040,5709520," we want to do we want to actually swap around the uh current board and the next one so i have no idea"
5709520,5716080," how i can do that all right so i guess i can just like do something like this right current board then"
5716080,5722800," with the current uh board i can do next board uh and then with the next board i can do tmp is there"
5722800,5729440," any way to swap around in here i don't actually know so in here it doesn't really like oh this is"
5729440,5737840," because this is actually const look at that we have to make it let's to be able to reassign this kind of"
5737840,5749440," stuff um oh yeah so people suggesting that you can use this destructuring uh right current uh current board"
5750240,5757440," next board and then next board current boards thank you random viewer in the chat i really appreciate"
5757440,5767520," that thank you thank you thank you uh so we've got some subs uh frontisic um 1984 thank you so much for"
5767520,5773200," 21 subscription with the message three more months and it's a year king still haven't learned c yet but i'm"
5773200,5780080," bad at rust so i can pretend i'm low level with it same i also don't know nothing about c and rust i'm just"
5780080,5784800," pretending that i know these languages and just like writing something thank you so much for for"
5784800,5791280," tier one subscription yes okay and after that what we want to do we want to actually re-render"
5791280,5796560," uh the uh the current board with the current context so that's how we're going to be doing all that"
5796560,5801440," isn't that progress so let's actually try to recompile this entire thing and go to the compilationers"
5801440,5807040," if we have any right i don't think we have any so everything seems to be fine right so i'm gonna refresh"
5807040,5814560," this entire stuff and let's actually create the uh glider right so if i remember correctly this is how the"
5814560,5815520," glider looks like"
5815520,5826960," first try first try we got the glider and we're gonna destroy this glider and the glider got destroyed"
5827600,5836160," isn't that poggers i think it's pretty freaking powers so yeah we can now play with this kind of"
5836160,5844480," stuff so that's actually very useful so ow i i cannot destroy some of them but yeah"
5849760,5858640," that's pretty easy peasy lemon squeezy uh okay so i don't really know it would be nice to maybe"
5858640,5868160," you know have some sort of like a element that allows you to just like select the current"
5869040,5879440," the current state right so um i don't really know how you how you do that like html radio buttons or"
5879440,5887360," something if you know what i mean like a radio buttons so there's an input type radio i that's what i want to do"
5888960,5896000," um to do to radio lebatons yeah something like this i want to have something like this"
5896000,5906720," uh right and what we do is just like a bunch of inputs uh but are we so there is a field set"
5906720,5913200," right so oh it's a field set is this thing which could be actually useful if you think about it right"
5913200,5923680," which could be kind of useful so let me let me try i'm gonna put it somewhere somewhere here"
5923680,5934560," field set field set"
5934560,5943120," uh so there is a legend i really like this so this is html5 stuff right so"
5943120,5948480," this is kind of a html5 so i suppose maybe the field set is blocked as well maybe i don't need"
5948480,5957520," to wrap it in p uh legends uh legends so state right and essentially what i want to have is just"
5957520,5964800," like a pick between the states that's that's a lot but that's fine i guess uh all right so this is just"
5964800,5972880," a legend and in here we can have one of these things right uh type radio id"
5973040,5982240," uh so let's call it dead uh dead dead dead so this one is checked"
5982240,5989920," and the label for this entire stuff so it's also closed with this thing"
5989920,6000320," am i going crazy yeah i am so okay so emacs just wanted to have this thing right we just want to have"
6000320,6012640," this thing uh and radio alive alive alive life um to be fair i want the alive to be checked by default and"
6012640,6017680," you need to switch to that uh if you want to change something i'll go now"
6020480,6023920," why do you want to change something and why do you want to change something and why do i see hui uh okay so dead"
6023920,6025680," for dead"
6025680,6028400," alive alive"
6028400,6038640," so and why it is not switching the tandem right"
6042560,6053680," type radio id type radio id name i suppose the name has to be the same"
6053680,6056000," uh-huh"
6056000,6058160," uh-huh"
6062160,6070480," yeah boy look ma look ma i'm a web developer look at that how can i access this stuff"
6070480,6072560," uh from javascript that's the main question"
6072560,6076720," value um so i suppose"
6079440,6085760," uh-huh so entry form"
6085760,6088640," okay"
6088640,6095920," so this is the forum or something like that uh"
6095920,6102160," i don't know can i okay so this is name state"
6103440,6110080," uh-huh so that means they're part of the of the same thing uh but that raises the question if i try to"
6110080,6119680," access uh right so document uh get element by id right so what if i try to query state so but"
6119680,6125840," this is not a particularly a state right so it's not going to give me anything uh it's not going to"
6125840,6131440," give me anything so that sucks how can i just get it how can i get it"
6131440,6138400," document form submit no i don't want the automatic browser"
6138400,6141200," shit what i want is just like give me the the value"
6141200,6149520," give me the value all right so javascript get value"
6153760,6156240," we get the value of selected radio button okay"
6156240,6162640," so value"
6162640,6166880," okay yeah yeah so that's what i'm talking about so"
6166880,6172800," yes yes yes stack overflow show me query selector input name"
6172800,6179920," this works in e9 holy that's what i needed in my life thank you"
6183280,6191520," so document get element by id rates but the rates wasn't rates actually the name"
6191520,6204160," the rates element is div so it okay wait a freaking second seriously so i need to get this thing"
6212720,6217360," seriously is that how it works i i can't believe that it's it's kind of stupid but i mean"
6217360,6231600," uh get element by id uh your mom right so we've got that uh that's pretty cool but now if i do value"
6231600,6235360," will it give me the value no it doesn't give me the value so it doesn't work the way i think it works"
6239360,6246000," i'll tell you whether the elements so this is a very dumb example i don't like it"
6246000,6262640," i guess we'll have to do something like this this is probably the easiest way to go about it"
6263360,6272640," so this is the way to do something like this is an input name so it's not a rate i mean of course"
6272640,6276720," it's a state uh it's a state uh it's a state"
6276720,6284960," really is the is the is is this really how you have to do that this is dumb this"
6288480,6291120," is this really the way you have to do that through like"
6291120,6296960," this is so dumb web is dumb"
6306560,6313760," get element by name but name get element by name but name actually get element by name let me see get"
6313760,6321040," get element by name uh state"
6322960,6331840," no no no elements maybe maybe element"
6331840,6341680," yeah it's even more dumb in my opinion and then yeah you you get one of these things and you iterate"
6341680,6345840," right so then you can check is this thing checked"
6348640,6353040," oh my god oh my god this is so bad holy shit ew"
6353040,6356800," fucking web disgusting ew"
6356800,6365760," anyway people and ironically program like like that for money jesus"
6367280,6373520," uh so um all right"
6373520,6384320," so what we're gonna do maybe this one uh right so essentially we can just get this by name right"
6384320,6387520," we can get this by name"
6395200,6396400," const state"
6396400,6405040," i don't know uh what is going on but after i did the eubit the the chat started to actually"
6405040,6411200," move faster and i find it hilarious i find it hilarious like i don't know what people are saying"
6411200,6416000," but just like after me shading on web just the chat starts to move faster and faster and faster and just"
6416000,6419200," got him anyway"
6423600,6430800," um what we're gonna do in here so when i click on uh this entire stuff"
6430800,6434800," um by the way by the way"
6434800,6443840," i can probably use this entire thing not as a value but rather as an index if you think about it"
6445280,6454000," uh right as an index because i can iterate this entire thing like that right less than state"
6454000,6464720," right and this thing would returns me a node node list of and in the node list of i presume i can take the"
6464720,6472240," length right so i just presume that i can take a length all right and if state i"
6473440,6476720," checked all right so here we can actually do something like this"
6476720,6481440," uh if state i checked"
6481440,6484080," we just"
6484080,6487120," set"
6487120,6488160," i"
6491600,6500640," okay so uh when i get this kind of thing uh right it's a node list of html elements uh but i"
6500640,6508720," suppose um here i'll probably do something like i probably have to cast it as html uh input"
6508720,6518720," element and i think input element does yeah it does have the checked if i take a look and it does have the"
6518720,6527280," check so i kind of like this approach right because um so depending on the index of this entire thing"
6527280,6534560," yeah we literally set the index of this entire thing to the uh to the current cell and it just"
6534560,6538880," works out and here by the way we have to actually return out of this stuff that's quite important"
6540160,6541440," uh so"
6541440,6547760," that's pretty poggers"
6547760,6553520," okay so that should work so and the reason why i'm doing it like that is because i want to be able"
6553520,6558480," to add more states in the future right we're going to have more and more states in the future as we go"
6559280,6564560," uh all right so here's the life and it works and then i can do dead and it works as well"
6564560,6573280," so and it also means uh i can add more different states in here look i can now just copy paste this"
6573280,6583280," thing like that uh and id alive and we're gonna say um green or let's say your mom right so this is a state"
6583280,6593600," value your mom uh for your mom your mom right so we have the third state now right so we have a"
6593600,6599520," your mom which is checked i don't think it has to be checked so let's actually see so this is a life"
6600560,6606800," this is dead and this is your mom and it automatically should have a green value right and"
6606800,6614320," it has a it has a green value your mom is green by the way uh because she's an ogre i'm sorry so and"
6614320,6619840," this is because we have predefined colors for four different states right for four different states"
6619840,6628720," we can have up until like four states uh right so this is why i want you to do that with radio buttons"
6628720,6634080," right because it makes it easy to integrate all of that into the system right so this um"
6634080,6641600," how to say that this editor becomes like generic right because as already said we're not doing"
6641600,6647680," specifically for conveys game of life right we're doing that for any cell or automata"
6647680,6653760," right for any of them so if i do next it actually removed this kind of thing because it doesn't know"
6653760,6658480," about your mom right so the this thing doesn't handle your mom right it only handles like"
6658480,6666480," dead and alive right if we put this kind of stuff in here yeah so it seems to be working we can put"
6666480,6671920," your mom uh somewhere in here and it's going to disappear on the next iteration because the"
6671920,6677200," the rule thingy doesn't know anything about that so let's actually remove your mom for for now right"
6677200,6682000," this kind of stuff is going to be very useful in the future so uh in the future i actually plan"
6682960,6689760," to add or remove radio bat buttons depending on the description of the seller automaton so it's going"
6689760,6695680," to change the ui is going to change depending on the the current description of the seller automaton"
6695680,6699200," so that's basically the idea for now right"
6699200,6709440," so that's basically the idea for now that's pretty cool okay so uh and one of the things i want to do"
6709440,6716240," the the last thing for today i suppose is uh take this code and translate it to the description of the"
6716240,6723120," seller automaton so get rid of this switch case and make the switch case basically index lookup within the"
6723120,6730880," tables right so that's my idea my goal for today at least uh this one's going to be really interesting"
6730880,6739920," because i'm not really sure how to do that right so goal uh and i feel like it might be just an array"
6739920,6747680," right because we have two states uh either dead or alive for the dead we're going to have two arrays in"
6747680,6760240," here right so two arrays uh that probably map um right so here we have like a zero and we have like uh"
6760800,6765680," one or maybe dead or alive dead or alive"
6765680,6778240," so maybe the whole seller automaton can be described as basically a bunch of arrays of integers and stuff"
6778240,6786800," like that that's actually a very interesting idea if you think about it right so and so if you're dead"
6788320,6795360," uh we can define uh we can define uh a table"
6795360,6803120," eight by eight two-dimensional table and the reason why we have a two-dimensional table is because"
6803120,6814480," um we have only two states all right uh so and we can define the rows of the table"
6815920,6823360," uh-huh so one two three four one two three four one two three four all right so"
6823360,6830800," i kind of like what i'm seeing here"
6830800,6836880," right so let's actually do it like that"
6840480,6848800," right so essentially this is the current state within the current state uh first row is gonna be"
6848800,6858320," the amount of dead cells and the second okay so as you can see in here"
6860080,6868960," uh a life the amount of a life has to be three an amount of dead has to be five all right the amount"
6868960,6879920," of that has to be five so this is zero one two three four uh five and this one has to be three zero one two"
6880640,6889040," three and this is where we switch to the uh to the new one right and since we are actually talking about"
6889040,6897920," the amount uh that means to accommodate that we have to have an extra row an extra column"
6898480,6907440," right so we have to actually have nine by nine by nine we have to have nine by nine all right so yeah"
6907440,6915280," so does it make sense what exactly i'm doing does it make sense what exactly i'm doing because it's kind"
6915280,6924960," of subtle as well all right so i'm encoding these conditions within the dimensions of these arrays"
6926160,6933120," within the dimensions of this array so the index uh within this array represents the amount of dead"
6933120,6938960," cells it represents the amount of dead cells and the column represents the amount of alive cells"
6938960,6950400," right so zero one two three four five um dead cells zero one two three alive cells and only then"
6950400,6955520," we're switching to a live state in any other situation it's going to result in a dead state"
6956640,6965200," so that's why so and this array is two-dimensional only because we have two states if we had three"
6965200,6970480," states this array would be three-dimensional and the one and so forth so it could be multi-dimensional"
6970480,6977280," table right and essentially switching the state is basically looking up within this table and getting"
6977280,6983680," that thing right and i want to do that because it's just like super easy right so the neighbors become the"
6983680,6989040," indices within that array you just like look it up and here's the next state and you can encode any sort"
6989040,6995920," of cellular automaton this way uh you see what i mean all right the same goes with the life right the same"
6995920,7003600," goes with the life uh right but with the life we have two situations it's when we have two and three so"
7003600,7010720," it's kind of like interesting uh right so three you you you can never have uh five"
7010720,7018080," alive cells and five dead because there are some always have to add up to eight anyway"
7018080,7026560," so because of that this representation is wasteful and i do know that i do know that it is wasteful"
7027120,7032800," right but i need to think about better representation if you know what i mean uh i need to think about"
7032800,7041040," better representation but i really like it because i just can plug the values of the current state and"
7041040,7045760," the current amount of neighbors just into this thing as an indices and get the next thing it becomes very"
7045760,7057200," compact uh so becomes very compact so essentially in case of it alive right i want to put this condition"
7057200,7065280," somewhere here like so uh in case of it alive uh we need to have how many dead cells how many dead cells"
7065280,7082800," do we need to have uh seven six zero one two three four five six uh six uh right and zero one two like so"
7082800,7094960," uh yeah so this should be enough i think this is the entire encoding of the game of life uh seller"
7094960,7102320," cellular automaton right this is the entire description it's kind of wasteful description"
7102320,7108960," i do realize that uh but i'm going to try to maybe simplify the representation a little bit later"
7108960,7113120," right so after the stream i'm going to spend some time thinking about it and we'll see what we can do"
7113120,7117440," about that so the reason why i was doing all that is because now i can do the following thing"
7117440,7124640," um emacs is a little bit laggy but that's fine so i have the current cell right"
7125200,7132080," i plug this entire thing into game of life and i sort of pick between these two tables"
7132080,7139920," right depending on the current cell i pick between this table and this table all right so then next"
7139920,7148960," i can take the amount of dead neighbors as an index then the amount of alive neighbors as an index and"
7148960,7158000," this is my next state that's it so i replaced this entire switch case with just this"
7158000,7168960," that was the whole point right so i moved from this entire thing uh to just this hopefully if i didn't"
7168960,7176240," make any mistakes you can never have nine dead cells and nine alive cells this is precisely what i was"
7176240,7182800," talking about for the last five minutes this is precisely what i was saying i said that this is a"
7182800,7188400," very wasteful representation i'm aware of that i'm going to spend some time thinking about that thank you"
7188400,7194720," very much i know that it is wasteful right i am aware of that so um"
7194720,7201120," people are again criticizing my unfinished code for being unfinished"
7202000,7212960," classic uh so let me let me see so that should be fine uh i wonder like i'm a little bit scared if i"
7212960,7220640," made any mistakes right if i made any mistakes um but hopefully maybe i did not okay so i'm gonna just"
7220640,7230000," set some thing in here and it it works it actually still works we can try to break this entire thing"
7230000,7236480," for instance i can get rid of this thing right so actually want to maybe comment it out because i'm"
7236480,7244080," afraid to lose the specific place where that happens right because it's a big table and everything uh"
7244080,7249680," right so now i'm gonna set it up and yeah as you can see it doesn't work it is broken it's a different"
7249680,7258320," cellular automaton like it's completely different now it's completely different um so yes yes yes"
7258320,7272160," but if i bring this thing back uh it is more correct it is now this thing we can also clean it up it will"
7272160,7279600," be kind of cool to actually uh implement the uh hold mouse down mechanics so basically i just hold it down"
7279600,7284640," and just draw with this entire thing that would have been actually kind of useful kind of more useful"
7284640,7294400," uh right so and i need to think how can i you know simplify not to really simplify but"
7294400,7300080," compress the entire representation because i kind of like how easy it is to just plug"
7300080,7308960," those values just plug those values into the indices and it just works right so if you think about it"
7309520,7318000," the the the single neighbors the single neighbors kind of represents a unique number right so all of the"
7318000,7329440," possible valid neighbors are actually kind of limited right so they are not uh eight or like nine by nine"
7329440,7338800," right they're not nine by nine uh they're very much limited which means that maybe you can even index them"
7340000,7347120," from zero to one from zero to one yeah i'll need to think i think like i have a couple of ideas on how"
7347120,7353840," to uh represent all of that in a more compact way but that will suffer the readability for a human"
7353840,7359120," if you know what i mean so essentially what's cool about this specific thing is that uh this table is"
7359120,7365040," still kind of readable for a human i can just like poke specific things in here but as soon as i add more"
7365040,7373120," states in here it becomes less readable so that's still a problem that's still a problem right so what"
7373120,7378240," i want to do in here is probably just um do a committee committee basically put it on the github for"
7378240,7386720," for anyone who wants to play with that and yeah i'm gonna create a license license mit all right read me"
7389120,7403200," so so we're gonna do quick start uh quick start um console so the first thing we want to do we"
7403200,7411680," probably do i want to do npm install right npm install uh to be fair you don't really need to do anything"
7411680,7420960," honestly uh because i plan to commit the javascript file as well in here right so i think the only thing"
7420960,7428640," you need to do is just open uh but let's actually uh like uh include full instructions right so bin"
7428640,7439200," tsc and then uh just use your favorite browser i use i explorer usually and open index html right so that's"
7439200,7442720," basically it uh let's do"
7442720,7446000," git"
7446000,7457920," so let's commit that that that that that that let's not commit node modules in fact i want to git ignore them"
7458960,7469760," not more modules right let's git ignore them package log package json ts config um ready set"
7469760,7478080," go uh so i'm still not uh not sure how to call this entire thing uh so i'm just gonna call it"
7479280,7484320," cellular automata"
7484320,7484880," right"
7484880,7487600," right uh new"
7487600,7492320," come on"
7492320,7494400," sell"
7494400,7498880," uh let's call the how to sell out to sell"
7500080,7515040," uh automata yeah it doesn't know how to spell that experiment yeah it says make it public"
7515040,7517520," and let's create the repo"
7521600,7528800," so now i'm going to copy paste this into i think um git remote add origin"
7528800,7539360," oh it's it was it was that fast okay uh i'm going to push that right into the repo"
7542800,7551760," yo look at that look at that you can find this in here uh i'm going to copy paste it in the chat"
7551760,7558400," and uh of course i'm going to copy paste it in the description here as well this is the source"
7559200,7568960," uh the source code source code cool um so essentially uh i'm going to think about how"
7568960,7577680," we could better represent this entire thing um and yeah we're going to continue this entire thing"
7577680,7585920," next time so let me see if anyone subscribed nobody subscribed so that's it for today thanks everyone"
7585920,7592160," who's watching me right now i really appreciate that have a good one and i see you all and next time"
7592160,7607280," maybe tomorrow we'll see uh love you"
