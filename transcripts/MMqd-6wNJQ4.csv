0,8120," But starting from the next month, right, starting from the December 1st, we'll start working on"
8120,15940," advent of code, right, because the advent of code is actually starting. Advent of code 2021,"
15940,23160," right, this one. So, and I'm going to be trying to do some streams on the advent of code. So,"
23160,32040," it's starting in 37 hours. So, yeah. And the theme of this year advent of code is going to be"
32040,39240," templeOS. So, the idea of my streams is going to be, I'm going to set up templeOS on a virtual"
39240,45560," machine. I think I'm going to set it up on QEMO. And I'm going to try to solve all of the advent of"
45560,51380," code problems using only Holy C. So, that's going to be the challenge of this year advent of code."
51380,57740," The last year we did, the challenge was to use a different language for each problem. In fact,"
57740,63840," I think you can still find it, AOC 2020. So, I think we managed to do all of that successfully."
63840,70040," Right. So, here we used different language for each individual problem. And the last one was"
70040,76860," solved in assembly. We even used assembly, x8664 assembly for Linux and NASM specifically. So,"
76860,80660," if you're watching live, I'm going to copy that in the chat. If you're watching on"
80660,88320," on YouTube, I'm going to put that in the description. Advent of code 2020. And here it"
88320,92260," is. So, we can find it in here. It's kind of interesting. Emacs highlights this thing, but"
92260,98880," doesn't highlight this one. It's kind of sus. Not going to lie. Right. And the advent of code"
98880,106900," itself. Right. So, it's going to be available in here. Advent of code 2021. So, I'm going to"
106900,117300," actually say, my solutions to advent of code 2020. Nico Red H. Thank you so much for two months. Yay,"
117300,120660," indeed. Thank you so much for two months of Twitch Prime subscription. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
120660,131540," And welcome to our epic advent of code club, I suppose. Right. So, and as I mentioned, the advent of code"
131540,141620," 2020 was basically each like use different language for each problem. 2021 is going to be use Holy C for the"
141620,148020," entire advent of code. Right. So, I don't know, like, I'm how I'm going to be sharing the solutions. And also,"
148020,154100," how I'm going to be getting the solution out of Temple OS, because I'm not sure if there's any, like,"
154100,162260," reasonable way for, you know, for Temple OS to interact with the things outside of the virtual"
162260,168180," machines. So, it's not like, well, it uses FAT32, right, or some sort of modification of FAT32. So,"
168180,175700," I should be able to kind of, like, mount the Temple OS file system and, like, take files out of it."
175700,182260," I'm not sure. I will have to research that. So, luckily, the first problem of event of code is usually"
182260,189380," some sort of a hello world. So, we can spend the entire first stream just setting up Temple OS"
189380,195940," development environment. Right. So, we're going to just create, like, a virtual image, like, install a"
195940,202000," Temple OS in there, like, research how to get the files out of the Temple OS and so on and so forth."
