720,6800," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreation programming session with"
6800,11840," a mr azuzi let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start the stream"
11840,19760," live on twitch and what are we doing today on twitch.a television website today we are adding"
19760,26720," a pop-up system to the music visualizer that we've been developing for quite some time i'm"
26720,31440," going to give the link to where we do know that twitch.tv/todding and i'm going to ping everyone"
31440,36880," who's interested in being pinged and there we go the stream has officially started hopefully did it"
36880,42160," send the message i don't see it sending a message discord hello uh thank you thank you so much for"
42160,48720," sending a message jesus right so hello hello welcome welcome welcome so today we continue working on"
48720,53760," visualizer which is music visualizing so let's take a look at this entire thing how the application looks"
53760,60080," like so let me quickly rebuild all this stuff this is not how you build it uh just a second"
60080,67840," and i'm gonna run uh the visualizer so as you can see it greets you with this message drag and drop"
67840,72800," music in here and what you're supposed to do in here you're supposed to drag and drop some music so"
72800,79040," let's actually go ahead and uh drag and drop a couple of files in here right so this is how it looks like"
79040,85360," and um essentially uh you have a panel in here you have a timeline you can control and there's a music"
85360,91520," visualization and stuff like that so the point is to be able to render all of that into high definition"
91520,96880," videos right so you can press r uh in the future i'm going to add the button that actually renders"
96880,100880," everything so you don't have to use shortcuts the shortcuts are still going to be there but those will"
100880,108400," be also ui button uh right so it's not really like a music player it's specifically uh visualizer right"
108400,114560," it's meant to take a music and create high quality visualization of the music so the the visualization"
114560,121200," itself is also going to be customizable and stuff like that so uh let me quickly disable what we've"
121200,127440," got in here so it actually crashed right so nice uh it didn't really crash yeah i just executed"
127440,134880," accidentally okay so it's fine so essentially if you drag and drop the music that cannot be loaded"
134880,140640," right if you drag and drop the music that cannot be loaded it will literally do nothing right so for"
140640,146720," example i can drag and drop the the folder right as you can see it doesn't do anything right it doesn't"
146720,153120," do anything though in the logs it will say that it couldn't load the file right so error could not load"
153120,158560," file uh though i could have actually done a little bit of a better job saying what exactly the kind of"
158560,166240," file i could not load i think that would have been a little bit better so if i go to src plug.c and find"
166240,172160," where exactly that is going on right so yeah so i need to actually add the file path in here so i'm not"
172160,179120," going to do it right now emacs what the fuck is going on with you okay emacs is going crazy so and"
180080,186720," the fact that it doesn't really show you uh that um you know you couldn't load the file um"
186720,196560," is because we changed the way our ui ux works right we completely changed the way our ui ux works"
196560,205360," so in the past you were not able to have several files right so uh so as you can see right now you can"
205360,210720," literally um drag and drop several files maybe simultaneously right you can simultaneously drag"
210720,217680," and drop a bunch of files if you want to uh right or you can uh drag and drop them separately right so"
217680,225840," and as you can see it all works so uh before uh before you could only drag and drop a single file"
225840,233120," right and we can take a look at how that worked right so i wonder at which commit uh we started to"
233120,240080," support several files i don't really know so there's muting more ui work uh so is there something like"
240080,247200," multiple yeah roughly outline multiple file support so we can actually uh check out this specific commit"
247200,256560," right so that was two months ago actually right so i got uh you know uh derailed a little bit on other"
256560,262960," projects so that's why it was uh so long ago right so i work on several projects simultaneously right"
262960,268800," so not everything uh comes as fast i would like to but yeah uh anyway so let's actually try to"
268800,275760," rebuild the entire thing and see how it goes right so this is an old build system uh and because of that"
275760,280560," it seems to me that it wants to rebuild everything okay that's fine so let's actually let it rebuild"
280560,293200," everything if it wants to um so yesu yesu yesu uh so this is immediate mod uia exactly uh and uh let's"
293200,299920," actually uh try to run it so and the old version kind of looks the same it kind of looks the same"
299920,307360," but if you drag and drop the file that it cannot read this is what it will show you right this is what it"
307360,312320," will show you if you drag and drop the file that it can read it start visualizing without like"
312320,318400," you know the side panel or timeline and stuff like that if you drag and drop what it cannot load again"
318400,327920," it will switch back to this particular screen so that works when you have on when you work only with one"
327920,335840," file at a time as soon as you introduce the side panel that can actually store several files that entire"
335840,342800," workflow breaks right so how are you supposed to show like couldn't load file how do you proceed from"
342800,349760," there right so like where do you show all of that so like once you introduce several files this particular"
349760,356720," screen doesn't make any sense anymore so the idea was uh let's actually switch back to"
358160,365920," several files to the latest version right so let's go ahead and do that let's actually rebuild uh oh yeah"
365920,370800," this is a funny one so i just need to remove the folder and start from scratch but if i start from"
370800,374880," scratch i'll have to rebuild um you know really but it's not that big deal"
377600,387280," right and if we take a look at how um now works right so the idea was uh that once we introduce this"
387280,394800," side panel if you drag and drop the file that it cannot load it will show up the classical in annoying"
394800,401440," visual studio code pop-up somewhere here saying yeah i couldn't know the file install the plugin for this"
401440,409440," version you know the the visual studio thing right so this is like the most logical thing to do in here"
409440,415360," right just you cannot load the file it will just spawn a pop-up here i couldn't know that file and that"
415360,421920," doesn't block any of the ui so the sort of like asynchronous from the ui and then it fades out over"
421920,429520," time right that's basically was the idea and then in the future we could use this pop-up system not only"
429520,435120," for reporting these kind of errors maybe in the future we're going to have more kind of errors that can happen"
435120,443680," and we can report them through that pop-up system right so and that's basically the uh the topic of today's"
443680,451920," stream let's just go ahead and introduce this pop-up system uh um right and yeah so that's the topic for"
451920,456960," today's stream that's the topic of the stream sounds good as sounds gucci sounds a tamaguchi"
456960,466880," let's go anyway so um i think i'm not actually yeah so we don't have a hot reloading enabled so let me"
466880,473200," quickly enable hot reloading right so these days how are you supposed to enable hot reloading"
473680,479840," uh you're supposed to find the config.h in the build folder and uh there will be define that you're"
479840,486080," supposed to enable right so you just enable that define and that is it you rerun knob and it picks up"
486080,493280," the new configuration and actually builds everything with a hot reloading enabled that's how cool the build"
493280,499840," system is that's how cool the build system is can your cargo do that can you cargo do that i don't"
499840,507120," freaking think so i don't forget no no we're dunking on web devs today okay can you web and webpack is"
507120,512400," is old can you white do that can you white i don't think so you white cannot do"
512400,519280," shit right i keep i need to keep reminding myself who's we're dunking on today right so it's it's"
519280,525920," it's web devs okay so white white it is then uh i know nothing about white by the way but it doesn't"
525920,534080," stop me uh right so let's go ahead and actually load this entire thing so uh we're going to be hot"
534080,540720," reloading this entire stuff right so we're going to be keep hot reloading so uh let me load this stuff up"
540720,547280," and uh i'm going to just keep it somewhere here right so somewhere on the side somewhere on the"
547280,555680," side and uh where are we gonna have our epic pop-up where are we gonna have our epic pop-up i guess"
555680,563760," somewhere here right i guess that makes sense to have the pop-up somewhere here okay so let's go ahead"
563760,570640," and draw a rectangle there to indicate the pop-up the pop-up so if i remember correctly this"
570640,575520," a window where you preview the uh the animation and stuff like that is called preview window right"
575520,582320," so let's actually find it so this is a full screen button this is not what i want to do so plug uh it"
582320,589120," has to be plug update there we go and uh we have a preview screen so that's the function we have to work"
589120,596960," with okay uh so this is a preview screen so whether we have a track loaded okay so we do in fact have a track"
596960,603760," clouded so then we handle some keys in here like full screen and stuff like that we are whether we"
603760,608400," are in a full screen mode or not a full screen mode okay so let's actually develop this entire thing for"
608400,614880," not a full screen mode somewhere here okay so what we want to do we want to draw a rectangle right so"
614880,621760," we want to draw a rectangle rect and let me maybe find the definition of this function because i want to know the"
621760,627920," signature of this function right so i have two ray libs in here by the way so we already updated"
627920,633520," to raylib5 but i still have a previous version even though i think it's not in the uh in the repo"
633520,642560," anymore but whatever so let's actually go to five uh so src arraylib.h right so and let's just find this function"
642560,649360," and it's a very simple function a draw rect it accepts rect and the color of the rect that you"
649360,658160," want to draw right and the core of the rect uh so uh let me see pop-up boundary let's actually call it"
658160,664080," pop-up boundary and to make it stand out let's actually use the red color so in the pop-up boundary"
664080,670560," is going to be something like pop-up boundary uh right and where it is going to stand right so where"
670560,678080," it is going to stand i suppose um we need to make it relative to the preview window right and the preview"
678080,684960," window is basically the preview boundary right so preview boundary so in terms of x all right so i"
684960,693440," suppose it has to be preview boundary x which is this specific corner and then plus preview boundary width"
694080,703280," preview boundary boundary width which basically this corner right which is this corner and if we do all"
703280,711280," of that for y right so this is going to be y plus height we basically find the position of the opposite"
711280,719200," corner in here of the opposite corner in here so we probably need to know uh we need to decide what's"
719200,726000," going to be the pop-up width and pop-up height because if we subtract uh pop-up width uh and pop-up"
726000,733200," height from the corresponding things in here we basically get the uh where the pop-up supposed to"
733200,738880," start right so it's going to be somewhere here it's going to be somewhere here we just have to decide"
738880,744560," what's going to be width and height of those mother flippers right so let's for now uh say that this"
744560,750000," thing is going to be 100 and the height is going to be maybe 50 right so this is going to be maybe 50 and"
750000,755120," once we decide uh on width and height we can just like you know forward this entire width and height in"
755120,761680," here and i'm going to query replace actually query replace width uh with height there you go we've got"
761680,767600," this entire thing i'm going to quickly try to rebuild just gently try to rebuild i think it is rebuilding"
767600,776720," hot reload look at that it appears immediately in here can you react do that web devs coping and seething right now holy"
776720,790000," i'm so sorry i i ate a little bit of apples right before the stream there is a lot of sugar in my in my blood"
790560,796560," so don't don't take everything i say seriously um so"
796560,806880," but that was easy that was easy those people will tell you you need a browser you need a don to be"
806880,815440," able to have to boom boom boom see p or c done you have a red uh rectangle you have a red rectangle that"
815440,820800," fucking easy uh do you want to see something cool do you want to see something cool that uh web devs"
820800,830000," cannot do i can freaking show you look you can actually start uh from preview windows exit but you"
830000,838800," can add half of the width of the preview boundary right and you can actually um essentially subtract uh"
838800,845280," half uh half of the width of the pop-up and you can do the same with this kind of thing"
845280,850400," you can do the same with this kind of thing right so and i'm gonna basically restart this entire stuff"
850400,855280," so there is a little bit of a problem in here because i forgot a comma so that's fine that is"
855280,863600," totally fine boom centered perfectly vertically and horizontally instantly can your browser do that easily"
863600,871920," within second less than a minute centered perfectly horizontally and vertically"
873680,876320," you cannot do in browser telling you"
876320,889120," oh yeah these days you have flexbox and stuff like that sure sure sure you need to uh you know"
889120,895280," you need the resources of several multi-billion dollar corporations to agree on the standards and update"
895280,903360," their browser engines just to be able to mimic the fraction of this power just to mimic the fraction of this"
903360,908000," this power look look how much resources you need here i just boom boom it's already done"
908000,914720," no meetings involved no development no issues nothing just centered"
923120,940000," all right uh so let's go back so we need to decide on uh the uh on the size of the pop-up right so we"
940000,947120," need to decide in the pop-up because this is a little bit small right so it's a little bit small uh so let's"
947120,953920," make it maybe twice as wide all right so let's make it twice as wide and what's going to be that so"
953920,960960," wideness looks okay so this is a pretty good wideness i would say you're right so this is a pretty good"
960960,970720," wideness and uh how about 100 in here so is 100 going to be good uh let's find out uh looks okay so you can't"
970720,976000," really see that because of my stupid head but that's the good pop-up right that's a good size"
976000,982960," of the pop-up to indicate some problems and stuff like that right so i think i think that's good more"
982960,988960," or less so we can always change it in the future right so it's not like set in stone it's not web i'm"
988960,997440," i'm joking um so let's go ahead uh so the thing i don't like about it is that there's no padding"
997440,1002240," between the edges uh of the pop-up there should be a little bit of a padding there should be a"
1002240,1009840," little bit of that margin right a little bit of that uh so let's go ahead and introduce that so i'm"
1009840,1018000," gonna do a float uh pop-up uh padding all right so this is a pop-up padding uh and this is gonna be"
1018000,1025600," just basically 10 pixels so in essentially we just have to subtract pop-up uh pop-up padding uh um"
1025600,1032560," horizontally and pop-up padding vertically so we're just subtracting all of that stuff and that should be"
1032560,1042160," basically it that enables the uh what happened did it crash i think it crashed god damn it can"
1042160,1047520," your browser do that uh window closed successfully i think i think i pressed the quit button okay so"
1047520,1053520," that's fine it's fine nothing crashed everything's fine everything's fine we didn't crash it's false"
1053520,1059600," alarm there we go look at that look at that we'll have a little bit of a padding padding a little bit of"
1059600,1067680," a padding super easy super easy super peasy so uh let me let me see so where is my plugging i want to"
1067680,1075200," increase uh this entire thing a little bit where's my compilation though there we go uh right so i'm gonna"
1075200,1083600," do h huh uh did it did it increase the thing okay so there we go so we have even more padding in here"
1084400,1091440," okay looks good looks gucci looks uh tamaguchi so but we want to have uh the system has to have"
1091440,1099920," um has to have several pop-ups so they should be stackable on top of each other right so they should"
1099920,1107760," be stackable uh on top of each other so how can we even uh develop such system how can we make them"
1107760,1113920," stackable on top of each other so let's go ahead and try to do that uh essentially let's imagine that"
1113920,1120640," we have uh several of them right so let's say we're going to have uh two pop-ups right we have two pop-ups"
1120640,1127840," now and we're going to be essentially iterating in here right so that's the current amount of pop-ups so"
1127840,1134080," all that is going to be rendered in the loop in the loop and since they're stacked up on top of each"
1134080,1139360," other right so they're stacked on top of each other this is going to be a vertical offset effectively it's"
1139360,1150800," a vertical offset um so and essentially uh what we're going to do so we will have to subtract um"
1152080,1158880," so we're adding height but we're subtracting height and padding and times right so"
1158880,1172160," so that is rather interesting that is rather interesting so we have to just subtract pop-up height"
1174080,1184560," maybe we can simply say plus like this multiplied by i right multiplied by i but that will make one of"
1184560,1190400," the pop-ups invisible because it's going to be basically zero so some of them is going to be down"
1190400,1195040," there so we can even take a look at how it's going to look like i'm actually really curious uh"
1195040,1200960," so if i do something like that yeah so there we go it actually went down so for that to work properly"
1200960,1207440," i think what we have to do we have to do plus one for the i right so we have to do plus one for the i"
1207440,1215440," and that will make it work uh perfectly i think so there we go so that means that if i want to add"
1215440,1221360," more pop-ups to the system so i can say now i want to have three pop-ups uh it is going to work now"
1221360,1226800," uh i have three pop-ups so i already basically have a rendering for the pop-ups"
1227840,1234320," all right so and essentially i can now have an array of pop-ups and instead of n i can use the"
1234320,1238640," size of that array and for each pop-up in that array it will just render this thing in there"
1238640,1245440," so yeah so this isn't that poggers right so at some point it's going to kind of overflow"
1245440,1252960," but i mean that doesn't really matter right so there's this kind of that uh so let's actually keep"
1252960,1259920," it at the size three right so let's keep it at the size three uh and uh yeah so we have that i think"
1259920,1264720," that's pretty cool i think that's pretty cool so one of the things i probably want to do now i want to"
1264720,1271280," take this entire stuff and maybe factor out um into a separate function right because i want to be"
1271280,1276880," able to use that function not only here but for instance in full screen right if i do full screen i"
1276880,1282800," went to full screen there is no pop-up tray in here i think pop-up tray is a good name for this thing"
1282800,1289120," right so pop-up tray it's only visible in here but you can drag and drop even in this mode i think right"
1289120,1294800," so if i basically drag and drop yeah you can drag and drop in this mode so that means an error may"
1294800,1300320," happen in this mode and the pop-up tray should be visible there also i think the pop-up tray should be"
1300320,1307760," visible in uh in a tutorial i'm going to call this thing a tutorial right so basically if you for the"
1307760,1314080," first time load something that is not loadable there should be also pop-up in here so this sort"
1314080,1319440," of like a mechanism that renders all these pop-ups should be reusable across several screens and because"
1319440,1324480," of that we'll need to pull it to a separate function right so does it make sense does it make sense i think"
1324480,1332080," i think it doesn't make sense let's go ahead and do that i think it's a good idea so um yeah so pop-up"
1332080,1340400," width and stuff like that so i'm gonna uh copy paste this entire thing and essentially say pop-up tray"
1340400,1347120," right so and since it's kind of bound to the preview preview window right so we'll have to provide the"
1347120,1353040," preview boundary right it's dependent on the preview boundary uh right so let's go ahead and do that static"
1353760,1359680," pop-up tray right so i'm gonna copy paste this entire thing in here and there we go so it's already"
1359680,1368800," factored out uh rectangle pop-up preview right so pop-up boundary i would even say uh pop-up boundary"
1368800,1375520," so let me try to rebuild this entire thing is it rebuildable it a little bit uh so it's not pop-up"
1375520,1385680," boundary it's a preview boundary i apologize for my mistake uh okay go okay so and uh let's copy paste"
1385680,1393520," a couple of stuff in here um let's copy paste a couple of stuff in here right so here's that so in"
1393520,1402160," full screen we don't have that so let's go ahead and add that in the full screen so if p full screen right so"
1402160,1408480," we can see that we have pop-up tray not in a full screen but we can add it in a full screen as well"
1408480,1414000," right in the full screen preview boundary is just different right so let's recompile this into i think"
1414000,1424080," so is it recompile already okay so if i go to full screen the pop-up tray here is visible it is in fact"
1424080,1428160," visible in here it's visible in here and it's visible in here and depending on the mode it's just"
1428160,1436240," located in different places right so you cannot see behind my camera but i mean like you everything"
1436240,1442800," should be visible right now i don't know what she was talking about uh right i'm actually super proud"
1442800,1451680," of this uh volume thingy so you you may think it's it's like no big deal right but look all of the ways"
1451680,1457520," you can interact with this thing so first of all like it expands right and it collapses it expands and"
1457520,1464960," collapses you can drag it you can click on this thing and drag it and depending on dragging it it"
1464960,1471200," actually changes its icon right you can drag it like that you can click on specific things to jump to"
1471200,1477200," specific things and you can click on that icon to toggle the mute and it actually remembers the previous"
1477200,1483520," location it actually remembers the previous location and furthermore when you're in a full screen mode"
1483520,1489040," uh right so if you wait long enough in a full screen mode it disappears but if you actually expand it in"
1489040,1495360," a full screen mode and stay in here uh right and you drag around like that and you stand while dragging"
1495360,1501120," around it is not going to disappear it is the behavior of this element is actually rather complicated"
1501120,1507280," and you may say okay it's not no big deal for web applications and it is true it's no big deal for web"
1507280,1514480," applications but it's written entirely in sync so it is written only using capabilities of placing shapes"
1514480,1520960," on the screen and i'm saying that not to show off how great of a developer i am look i can do that without"
1520960,1528640," the browser no no i'm sure you know that not to uh right i'm not bragging right i'm not bragging i'm"
1528640,1536160," telling that just to show you like how much you can achieve with just simple placing of shapes on the"
1536160,1546400," screen if such a dummy dumb dumb can do that you can do that as well right i'm not bragging i'm not"
1546400,1553440," showing off in fact i'm a very dumb developer right i'm a very i would say mediocre developer i just been"
1553440,1559840," doing that for for very long right i just been doing that for very long not as long as some people"
1559840,1565200," out there who's been doing that for 40 years but but anyway i'm relatively dumb so what i'm saying is"
1565200,1575360," that if uh you keep it simple uh you can achieve a lot with very simple things you can achieve like enormous"
1575360,1582880," amount of things that's what i'm saying a lot of things right it's kind of weird that sometimes"
1583440,1588480," when i show this kind of things people are treating it like i'm trying to show off or anything like"
1588480,1597520," that right so it's actually quite the opposite can you use the mouse wheel yes thank you so much you can"
1597520,1602160," i forgot about that thank you for reminding me you can also use the mouse wheel"
1602160,1609200," and all of that within a single component all of that within a single component you can do that you can"
1609200,1616320," also press amp to toggle the mute so there's also a keyboard support here as well so i really like"
1616320,1622640," this element because it's such a simple element at the glance but look how many ways you can interact"
1622640,1627600," with it right it's kind of cool isn't it it's just like yeah to make it interact with all these possible"
1627600,1631840," ways right so you have to put some work in it but it's not that hard it's actually very simple"
1633040,1639760," uh right and with the arrow keys i didn't add the capability to do arrow keys but something yeah"
1639760,1649920," so anyways i also like this scrolling which is super smooth with acceleration and stuff like that"
1649920,1655760," and it's also implemented in prc right so and i'm not using any ui framework or anything like that"
1655760,1659760," and i'm saying that not to flex on show off again right"
1659760,1665520," so"
1665520,1677760," uh yusu yusu yusu so we have that so another thing i would uh i wanted to actually do another thing that i"
1677760,1683520," wanted to do uh right is to have this pop-up thingy in a drag and drop music here right i think it's quite"
1683520,1691680," important so if i go to here drag and drop music here um so we don't really have a preview window in"
1691680,1698000," here so we might as well actually do it like that so pop-up uh tray right so here's the pop-up tray and"
1698000,1710800," we can use the collateral uh people quite often ask me zozin how do i find collateral how do i find"
1710800,1716480," collateral this is actually very easy so you go to the source code of raylib"
1716480,1723760," right you go to the source code of raylib you go into the src and you locate a file called raylib.h"
1723760,1730640," you locate a file raylib.h you go there all right you go to the beginning of the file and you find"
1731280,1735760," clitoral and there you go you locate it"
1735760,1747840," it's that easy everyone it's that easy right so sharing knowledge for you for free um so there we go"
1747840,1756880," so we're gonna start with zero in here right so basically what i need i need a rectangle uh i need a"
1756880,1763760," rectangle um that covers the whole screen right so but do we have width and height in here yeah we do"
1763760,1772560," have width and height so i can just basically say width and uh height there we go pop-up tray"
1772560,1781200," pop-up trails actually try to to do that and there we go so essentially if there will be in the future"
1781200,1787920," any errors while loading uh files in here the pop-up is going to be visible uh so the pop-up is going to be"
1787920,1794240," visible in here and also in the full screen right so three different scenarios all of that stuff is in fact"
1794240,1802240," visible all that stuff is visible uh you sue you sue yes so so the next thing we need to do i think the"
1802240,1810480," pop-up should have rounded corners right so because right now it's too pointy uh you can catch yourself"
1810480,1816320," on that corner i think so it's kind of dangerous right so you need to smooth out the corners uh right"
1816320,1822240," you need to smooth out the corner so let's try to do that maybe maybe let's give it a try uh i don't"
1822240,1832240," quite remember so let's go to ray leap one more time uh ray dot h uh draw rectangle and i think it was"
1832240,1839920," something like a rounded yeah rectangle rounded uh-huh and so there's a roundness and segments"
1839920,1848800," so let's go ahead and put it in here so we need to find a pop-up tray so here's the pop-up tray and we"
1848800,1854960," want to replace this thing with something else so here's the color uh it's going to be red um it's"
1854960,1863360," going to be red so pop-up boundary boundary around this if i remember correctly roundness is basically"
1863360,1869040," from zero to one right so we're going to make it like 80 and the amount of segments let's make 20 or"
1869040,1879040," something uh and now i'm going to try to recompile this entire stuff uh boom that's too rounded i think"
1879040,1890640," uh so did we go did we went like f did we apt uh did we apt i think because the the server connection"
1890640,1897040," timed out reconnecting uh right so maybe maybe it's just chat arena maybe it's just my chat arena anyway"
1897040,1904080," so everything seems to be okay everything seems to be docking um okay so let's actually make it maybe"
1904080,1912880," half all right because i think it's too much i think it's too much uh right uh exited abnormally it's kind of"
1912880,1919920," weird sometimes it just crashes when maybe it actually crashed when it was in the middle of writing or"
1919920,1926560," something but i'm not quite sure what exactly happened in here uh okay so this one is fine uh this one is"
1926560,1939600," fine so maybe what about 13 what about 13. i think this is better so this sort of roundness is okay i think"
1939600,1947200," i think it looks good it kind of looks close to how the other things looks in here right so yeah but the"
1947200,1955920," question is does it have to be like this red does it have to be this super red uh right it could have been"
1955920,1962880," just the the background right so like this thing um so let's actually introduce maybe something like a"
1962880,1971920," pop-up background color right pop-up background color and at the top in the file we have uh yeah"
1971920,1978320," it actually starts with a caller right so you're supposed to name it caller uh pop-up background right"
1978320,1985440," and the thing we use we usually like i have a general background color for all of the things in"
1985440,1992480," here but not really uh so there's a track panel button background right so we're going to be using the"
1992480,1997680," same color as the track panel button background right so i'm going to just like do it like that"
1997680,2004640," and as you can see we use it like literally for for all of the things in here literally for all of the"
2004640,2011440," things in here uh so it didn't compile because yeah i used the wrong naming the color is supposed to be"
2011440,2019040," actually actually the prefix right so that is totally fine that is totally fine and i'm going to just"
2019040,2025200," quickly refresh the whole thing and i go so the pop-up looks like this does it look good does it convey"
2025200,2032080," that it's an error does it convey that it's an error maybe we should have actually used like an accent color"
2032640,2040560," instead of it it kind of it's kind of bad right so we have a thing called accent color uh what if we"
2040560,2048880," literally just use accent color color accent uh right so maybe that's gonna be better maybe that's gonna be"
2048880,2058160," better uh-huh so nah so basically the same colors that are used in here and stuff like that"
2058800,2066240," uh kind of low key red background was actually kind of good in my opinion i think it was actually kind"
2066240,2073200," of good right so you can make it red uh but red we're using the standard red from raylib right"
2073200,2083360," so what we can do what we can do we can actually use the red uh based on the accent color right so we're"
2083360,2090880," using uh hsv model to define the accent color so it's a hue saturation value we can keep uh saturation"
2090880,2095920," and value the same as the accent color but we can say the hue has to be red if i remember correctly"
2095920,2103200," red is actually zero so it's basically the angle on the color wheel right so hue is the angle on the color"
2103200,2109920," wheel and zero corresponds to red if i remember correctly right so if i remember correctly so zero red"
2110480,2116240," so i should go ahead and uh try to do that so it's basically going to be the same uh situation and"
2116240,2123600," value as uh the accent right so but with the red and yeah it made it kind of a little bit darker which"
2123600,2128160," is which is probably fine right which is probably fine i think i think it's all right so let's just keep"
2128160,2137760," it like this let's just keep it like this okay so and uh we need to have uh some sort of um some sort"
2137760,2146320," of a text there right so pop-up tray uh so we need to render the text we need to render the text in there"
2146320,2156240," okay so who remembers how to draw the text right draw text uh right not texture but text"
2156240,2163440," uh okay so you can draw the text but we need to be able to draw the text with different sizes and scales"
2163440,2169040," and stuff like that so we're probably going to be using the text pro maybe a pro is too much let's"
2169040,2176480," actually just use the draw text extension right it also allows you to specify the tint spacing font size"
2176480,2185280," and so on and so forth okay uh right so let's go ahead and just put the text in here so the font we're"
2185280,2191440," going to be using we're going to be using the font from here and the text uh is going to be something"
2191440,2202000," like uh could not load the file could not load file uh right so where's uh we're going to have a position"
2202000,2206320," right so where are we going to have a position this is actually very interesting the position should be"
2206320,2212400," based on the pop-up boundary so let's actually literally place it on pop-up boundary x and y"
2213280,2216960," all right so this is going to be something like this so this is where it's going to be located"
2216960,2225680," the font size is rather interesting so it's going to float font size i think i already did that trick"
2225680,2232240," where the font size was based on the boundary height yeah that's a good idea so yeah here if we take a"
2232240,2237840," look it's the basically boundary height half of the boundary height so i think i'm going to use this trick"
2238960,2246080," boundary height literally half of the boundary height is going to be that spacing we just can keep it zero"
2246080,2252000," and this one is going to be simply white all right so this one is going to be simply white so if i now"
2252000,2259520," try to recompile this entire thing hopefully it will maybe work and yeah there we go could not load file"
2260880,2268560," i think that's very cool right so at least we placed something on the screen it looks scuffed"
2268560,2276320," it looks ugly but we placed something on the screen and that's a very good first step right don't get"
2276320,2282640," discouraged by these kind of results right it's imperfect but then once you have something on the"
2282640,2289120," screen you can go ahead and refine it and make it better you can work with that you can iterate upon it"
2289120,2296240," it don't get discouraged don't listen to these goddamn haters uh just keep improving just keep grinding"
2296240,2303200," grinding grinding uh so remember sigma grind set or ligma balls"
2303200,2308160," ligma ball set"
2308160,2318640," anyway so uh let's actually try to reduce the size of the font because i think if if we look at it right so"
2318640,2324720," it's a little bit too big right it's a little bit too big uh all right so there we go"
2324720,2332800," okay uh that's a little bit better that's a little bit better but now it's a little bit too small"
2332800,2339760," it's a little bit too small so let's make it maybe make it a little bit bigger uh what about 35 it's it's"
2339760,2345920," very sensitive as you can see it's very sensitive to the size i don't really know why but but it actually is"
2345920,2352080," but it actually is okay 35 what about 30 what about 30 i think 30 is going to be perfect"
2352080,2360480," uh all right so font size for ants i mean it is what it is and it is what it is anyway so now we need"
2360480,2364560," to do something that web developers cannot do we need to center it"
2367280,2369760," we're about to center those mother flippers"
2369760,2381360," we are about to center those mother flippers uh so um but to do that we need to know the size of the"
2381360,2387520," text like uh the the boundary of the text the width and height and stuff like that how the"
2387520,2390960," fuck can we even know that how the fuck can we even know that"
2390960,2402800," so there is a function there is a function that can do that for us it's called measure text uh measure"
2402800,2408400," text if i'm yeah there we go so essentially you provide the size and it basically gives you the"
2408400,2414240," boundary right so it basically gives you the boundary surprisingly it also returns an integer why the heck it"
2414240,2420640," is it does return an integer measure string for default and it's never specified"
2420640,2427520," we can also always look it up because we have the source code of uh of radio right so we can just search"
2427520,2436000," for uh measure text and just see how it is in fact implemented so it is implemented like this and what do we"
2436000,2437680," return in here we return x"
2437680,2448240," i guess it makes sense right so maybe um that's that's very interesting so it's sort of like"
2448240,2453440," caters toward a very specific use case so maybe this is a very common thing that you want to have from"
2453440,2457360," the text just get the the x right so"
2459600,2466480," okay so i mean um this is not what i need but that's fine uh wait wait a second measure text only"
2466480,2475840," gives you the x this is not yeah width no this is not what we want i want a full width and height so"
2475840,2484080," we need measure text xc that's right okay so so measure text returns you one thing and measure text xd so i"
2484080,2488640," thought that it maybe returns something from the point or something like that i just had a huge brain"
2488640,2495280," for it i'm really sorry so i have a 40 brain today so that's what we actually need that's what we actually"
2495280,2502000," so and we can do something like size right so we have already position we have font size and so on and so"
2502000,2509200," forth so this is going to be that uh we can now provide the text the font size and the spacing is"
2509200,2516240," going to be obviously zero so we have uh we have a size in here so but we probably need to now compute"
2516240,2522160," position based on the size of the text so that means we have to put it above right so because all of that"
2522160,2531680," now will depend on the size so now we have to add half of the um pop-up boundary essentially right half of"
2531680,2540960," the pop-up boundary width um right at half and subtract half of the x of the size right so the the centric"
2540960,2547440," trick i was talking centering trick i was talking about right so here we're going to have uh height"
2547440,2554320," and uh here we're going to have y so and that should be enough i think uh that should be more than enough"
2554320,2562240," to center all of the size uh all right okay good"
2562240,2578320," can your css do that that easily just center that sheets just center that sheets uh maybe it could have"
2578320,2585440," been actually a little bit you know shorter right so i think it's just like a little bit too high right"
2585440,2591440," so there's a little like too much space in here in my opinion so maybe we should make it smaller"
2591440,2597040," right so we're going to be like thinner things but since we already kind of figure out how to render"
2597040,2602560," everything we can just control these kind of things right so height let's say that height is going to be"
2602560,2612320," maybe 75 right it was 100 but what about 75 is 75 going to be a little bit better right and this is a"
2612320,2618880," very interesting thing because the size of the font depends on the height for some reason uh all right"
2618880,2627120," so now it became like a font for ants what if we make it depend rather on the width uh than on the height"
2627120,2636160," so is it going to be better so it's probably kind of going to blow up uh it crashed again why does that"
2636160,2642000," crash from time to time i'm actually not sure i'm actually not sure whether okay so could not load"
2643360,2651520," nice so this is this what happens when you uh when you do that uh right so i don't really know why it"
2651520,2658560," crashes and it's kind of bizarre it's kind of bizarre so we'll have to investigate that but i don't think"
2658560,2666800," it's something super uh super strange super weird maybe i'm just like referring to some point or something"
2667520,2673920," uh yeah so this is going to be just one so let's make it two uh let's make it two"
2673920,2682480," uh-huh so that's the difference between one and two i put one"
2682480,2688080," it's too small i put two"
2690240,2698960," uh that's the shit i have to deal with right that's the shit that we have to deal with like"
2698960,2706560," measure units and everything what about 15 is 15 going to be perfect is 15 going to be perfect it's"
2706560,2710320," actually in fact perfect i think right so"
2710320,2718560," uh yeah i think i think i like how all of that looks like right so in terms of like i think that's a"
2719200,2727120," really like okay pop-up for now it's an okay pop-up for now it's not ideal but it's okay for now to"
2727120,2735040," indicate that you did a fucky walkie oopsie doopsie so for this kind of stuff it is optimal i think"
2735040,2740080," uh right so and we can increase the amount of test pop-ups in here as you can see right so we can make"
2740080,2747120," four of them if we want to uh right so there we go we have four pop-ups now so instead of three we have"
2747120,2754000," four of them so it's a very easy system to experiment and play with and again all of"
2754000,2763120," that is in prc that's what you can get with this simplicity simplicity is the key simplicity simplicity"
2763120,2773600," keep it simple quite often by the way people always confuse simplicity and difficulty uh maybe they do that"
2773600,2779280," intentionally right or maybe they are coming from a different language where there's no distinction"
2779280,2785680," between simplicity and complexity for example i personally come from such language my native language"
2785680,2792560," does not distinguish simplicity and complexity and i confuse them as well quite often uh right but in"
2792560,2797920," english there is a difference right so simplicity um is a category"
2797920,2809280," i was i was trying to say people don't distinguish simplicity and difficulty right so simplicity and"
2809280,2819040," difficulty uh so there's two kind of things uh so what i was i'm trying to say that's what i'm talking about"
2819040,2825360," yeah so i'm coming from such language that um right doesn't really distinguish that some people say"
2825360,2833120," okay so some people suggest that you can do that yeah yeah it is true but not that many people pay"
2833120,2841040," enough attention to the difference between these two words right but not enough people pay attention"
2841040,2844400," like to the difference between like to the difference between two words right so there's two kind of two"
2844400,2857760," concepts right it's uh complexity complexity and uh difficulty right difficulty complexity is basically how many"
2857760,2865520," moving parts you have in a system if you have a complex system it has a lot of moving parts"
2866880,2875280," difficulty difficulty is how much effort you have to put to like achieve something right achieve something"
2875280,2885040," right so uh in a complex complexity complexity something uh like um something that has very low complexity"
2885040,2890720," we call such thing simple right so something with a very low complexity"
2891920,2901200," we usually call simple in english something that has a very low difficulty we call easy right we call easy"
2901200,2911200," what i'm saying is that what we need in software development is simplicity we need to make things"
2911200,2915200," simple otherwise otherwise they become very difficult to work with"
2915200,2918400," over time"
2918400,2929840," so and quite often uh i i say right so that c is uh a simple language and then i show how i work with c and"
2929840,2937920," they say they say how is that simple it is simple it is not easy but it is simple but over a long run"
2937920,2945200," over a long run if you keep the system simpler it becomes easy to work with because the simpler the"
2945200,2952640," system is the less you know problems it cause the less moving parts it has it's like a general"
2952640,2959120," engineering principle actually that we as software engineers we call ourselves engineers do not fully"
2959120,2962800," understand for some reason uh right so"
2962800,2972000," we think that we can just keep tucking away complexity under the layers of obstructions and"
2972000,2978560," just because it's behind the layer of obstruction it doesn't exist anymore it still exists you do not"
2978560,2985920," solve the problem of too much complexity by piling layers of obstructions you don't solve complexity by adding"
2985920,2992000," more complexity you solve complexity by removing complexity does it make sense i don't know"
2992000,3001840," it makes sense here we tried right gooey yes uh i didn't like it at the time it felt a little bit"
3001840,3005600," okay it felt a little bit unfinished at the time i tried it maybe it became better"
3006240,3014880," and uh it doesn't do what i want to do right so i have a very specific vision about how ui is going"
3014880,3020240," to look like is how it's going to work and how i'm going to be using it and the ragu doesn't really"
3020240,3024880," fit that vision i'm not saying that it's a bad library or anything that's just like it doesn't fit what i"
3024880,3032000," want right if that makes any sense um i tried it yeah so it doesn't it doesn't fit my my goals"
3032000,3037280," react easy complexity vanilla js difficult simplicity"
3037280,3045120," uh i don't know so because there is a point at which complexity turns into difficulty"
3045840,3056560," right so you can like piling complexity is easy until that complexity that you pile turns into"
3056560,3065200," difficulty right it's a constant trade-off it's just like no constantly burning right the fuel and then"
3065200,3070160," realize it that you caused the climate change or something right i'm not sure if it's a good analogy but"
3070960,3076320," uh there's like a lot of things in software engineering that are really hard to put into words"
3076320,3083200," unless you experience them yourself unless you experience them yourself it's just like"
3083200,3090080," um more experienced developers keep talking about complexity simplicity we need to keep things simple"
3090080,3096400," we need to keep things simple and then less experienced arrogant developers come to the more experienced"
3096400,3103280," and demand please explain me what you mean i do not understand that but the concern about keeping"
3103280,3110480," things simple comes from working with enormously complex system you like the thing that you experience"
3110480,3119840," by working with a system that is like six ten million lines of code the you cannot explain these problems"
3119840,3125760," and this thing with words you literally cannot explain them you have to experience them yourself"
3125760,3132480," and let's experience uh developers demand explain all of these years of working on complex system like"
3132480,3136080," in a couple of words so i can agree with you otherwise i'm not going to agree with you"
3136080,3139520," like i don't know it's just like"
3139520,3153040," i think i want to make a small break right so i've been slapping the code for almost an hour"
3153040,3160880," i don't even have tea honestly right i forgot to uh prepare the team so i was developing with water"
3160880,3168320," uh so i need to make a break make a proper cup of tea cup of tea cup of tea cup of tea cup of tea cup of"
3168320,3175360," cup of tea cup of tea cup of tea and then we're gonna continue um all right so let's continue uh so i'm"
3175360,3181840," thinking that there is a little bit of a kind of strange thing so the padding of these buttons is one thing but"
3181840,3188960," the padding of these things is different so i'm not fully sure how exactly i want to go about it so"
3188960,3199440," i kind of like the padding between the um the tool things right so the the um the pop-ups but i think"
3199440,3206000," maybe the right padding has to be aligned with the padding of buttons in here i think that would make a"
3206000,3216160," little bit more sense right at least um or maybe even yeah maybe the padding like top and the right"
3216160,3223040," has to be like the same in here and in here which kind of means that we need to have three separate"
3223040,3229920," parameters the right padding the bottom padding and the padding between the the things right the padding"
3229920,3235040," between the things so that's probably something that we may want to work on it's just something to keep"
3235040,3242960," uh you know to keep in mind so now what i want to do i want to actually start keeping track of the"
3242960,3251040," of the pop-ups right so let's go ahead and do that so here we have a plugin that stores"
3251680,3256240," uh the entire state of the application right so we have entire state of the application"
3256240,3263280," and i want to introduce the pop-up so pop-up i think should contain at least the text of the error"
3263280,3269120," right it should contain the text of the error but right now we only have one error right so we only have"
3269120,3275120," one error which is like could not load file so maybe pop-up is not going to store the text for now"
3275840,3281520," one of the things that i think it should store it should store like for how long it existed"
3281520,3287040," it should store for how long it existed because as we add them they're going to be probably added at"
3287040,3293600," the bottom right so they're going to be uh appended at the bottom and they're going to fade out as the age"
3293600,3298800," so to speak and they're going to disappear over time so because of that we uh probably going to have"
3298800,3304000," something like a lifetime right which is a float which probably will store the seconds and the thing is"
3304000,3310240," going to slowly fade away or something like that right roughly something like that so and also"
3310240,3316720," we need to have several of the pop-ups so it's it's going to be probably some something like a ring buffer"
3316720,3323840," right it's going to be something like a ring buffer so uh how are we going to actually go about that"
3323840,3330160," right so maybe we're going to have something like a pop-ups uh right so pop-ups maybe pop-up"
3331280,3338640," let's actually call it pop-up tray similarly uh similarly to uh the function that renders the"
3338640,3343600," pop-up train right so the pop-up train yeah so there's a function that runs a pop-up train and we"
3343600,3348800," have a structure that stores the pop-up train right it does in fact store the pop-up train"
3348800,3353120," so uh and we're going to have a bunch of elements in here so they're going to be items"
3353760,3364080," and to be fair we probably don't want um to have unlimited amount of pop-ups because they're"
3364080,3370160," probably not going to even fit in here they're probably not going to even fit in here so uh maybe"
3370160,3376480," we're going to have something like a pop-up tray capacity right so uh this is going to be pop-up tray"
3376480,3381200," capacity pop-up tray capacity and let's say we're going to have 10 pop-ups we don't really need more"
3381200,3386880," than 10 pop-ups so and essentially this is going to be a ring buffer right it's going to be a ring"
3386880,3393040," buffer and the way i implement the ring buffer right essentially i have a bunch of elements uh like a"
3393040,3398640," limited amount of elements in the ring buffer right and i keep track of the begin right i keep track of"
3398640,3406320," the begin and i keep track of the uh size right so basically the count of how many elements i have in a"
3406320,3412640," the ring buffer right and that is usually enough to to implement all of that so if i add a new element"
3412640,3420720," uh to the right i just increment the uh the count if i add it to the left i increment the begin uh"
3420720,3427040," and the count all right so but then i can wrap around left and right sort of speak right i can"
3427040,3433360," wrap around uh left and right and one of the things we'll have to do we'll have to be able to add it to the"
3433360,3438960," beginning right because we're going to be adding the pop-ups at the bottom which the bottom is the"
3438960,3443920," beginning of the ring buffer right so we're going to be adding the pop-ups at the bottom and we're going"
3443920,3449520," to be popping over them from the uh from the end so it's sort of like a queue right it's sort of like a"
3449520,3454560," queue but at the same time it's also a ring buffer because if you overflow uh the beginner is going to"
3454560,3461840," just like wrap around and consume the older pop-ups right it's going to consume the older pop-ups i think"
3461840,3463920," yeah that's a that's a good idea i think it's going to work out"
3463920,3472800," uh i think it's going to work out all right so let's just give it a try let's just give it a try"
3475280,3483280," uh size t begin size t end um all right so that not really end right so it has to be the count"
3483280,3490720," right so it has to be the count and we're going to be storing uh this kind of pop-up tray in here pop-up"
3490720,3501280," tray uh let's go pt right so pt and the way we're going to be uh essentially rendering pop-up tray the way"
3501280,3508240," way we're going to be rendering is we're going to be iterating through the elements of the pt right"
3508240,3514080," so instead of n we're not iterating through n anymore right so we're iterating through p which is plugin"
3514080,3520960," which is the state of the plugin pt and the count right so that's what we're iterating uh through uh"
3520960,3530160," that's what we're iterating through uh and now all right and now this is not what i want um if i refresh"
3530160,3538240," the whole thing if i refresh it doesn't refresh uh so that's kind of it actually hanged i don't know"
3538240,3549840," why it okay uh so just a second i think shell yeah so why did it hang uh so the count is super ah this"
3549840,3554800," is because i updated the schema yeah i cannot update the schema of the structure without reciting the whole"
3554800,3561840," application that's fine actually that is fine so that's something that may happen uh all right all"
3561840,3568080," right all right all right so let's give it a try okay so right now there is no a single pop-up right"
3568080,3577600," because the pop-up tray is empty but now i can try to uh right yeah i can try to uh put something that is"
3577600,3583600," not loadable and it's still not going to cause any problems and this is because we need to implement"
3583600,3592560," um the following thing so remember there was like error load file pop-up right so and this is where we"
3592560,3600000," need to add a new element to the pop-up my neighbors are doing something i don't really understand"
3601360,3607760," oh my god and it's it's a midnight it's a fucking midnight these motherfuckers are fucking jumping"
3607760,3624960," around um anyway um so how are we gonna go about that so we probably can do something like um pop-up tray"
3625520,3632800," push right so we push a new thing into the pop-up tray right which is kind of silly"
3632800,3640160," all right so maybe yeah maybe we just have to rename the entire thing to pop-up push"
3640160,3645360," pop-up tray push right so right now it doesn't really accept anything but yeah"
3645360,3651920," and the way we're gonna do about that the way we're gonna do about that essentially is"
3653440,3660720," if so there are two situations actually whether we already exceeded the capacity"
3660720,3666400," right so for example if we still have a little bit of a pop-up capacity pop-up tray capacity"
3666400,3675280," we can simply do pt begin minus one right and then pt count plus one and there you go we append it to the"
3675280,3682000," beginning right so we append it to the beginning but here is an interesting thing uh we're subtracting"
3682000,3688640," from uh an unsigned value so if it's zero it's going to underflow so and essentially we have to"
3688640,3695680," have an additional check in here we cannot use modern here right so if it is equal to zero uh what we have"
3695680,3703360," to do we have to set this entire thing to the pop-up tray capacity minus one we just have to wrap it"
3703360,3709280," around otherwise we can actually subtract it like that right so we can't use modular arithmetic in here"
3709280,3715920," because it's unsigned stuff and everything so this is one situation right so this is one situation"
3715920,3724880," so if we uh ran out of capacity if we ran out of capacity we can essentially just over write"
3724880,3732000," the other end of the uh ring queue so effectively we can just copy paste this thing but we don't have to"
3732000,3738720," increment the count we can keep the count the same so that's basically the idea that's basically the idea"
3738720,3745040," and essentially that allows us to compress the entire thing like so all right"
3745040,3748800," doesn't it"
3750880,3758640," yeah it does i think there you go so compression oriented programming by kc moratorium you just"
3758640,3765040," implement something in a very straightforward way and then you compress it so yeah there we go so we just"
3765040,3771440," increment like begin uh just increment begin and then we see do we have any any more capacity uh all"
3771440,3779600," right so we just like increment that capacity otherwise it's just going to wrap around and yeah as usual"
3779600,3788080," okay let's try to uh maybe refresh everything so we don't have that so here what we have to do we"
3788080,3794240," have to do pop-up uh tray push right so we're pushing stuff into the pop-up tray"
3797120,3802880," and i'm going to refresh the whole thing so hopefully now uh i can load more music right"
3802880,3806800," but then i can load something that doesn't exist and that added a new pop-up in here"
3806800,3812240," so it couldn't load something so it added pop-up"
3812240,3819040," i did another one and another one and another one and another one and another one every time i cannot load"
3819040,3828240," something so that's pretty cool that's pretty epic uh right so essentially the only thing we need to"
3828240,3834480," implement is for them to disappear over time right so we want them to disappear over time"
3834480,3840240," so when we push the uh pop-up tray right so one of the things we probably want to do actually"
3841920,3848640," is basically take the items and ppt begin right so that's the current item that we pushed in there"
3848640,3855200," and we want to put a lifetime on that uh on that item right so for how long that pop-up is going to"
3855200,3862720," exist right for how long is it going to exist uh let's say we're going to have like a pop-up um lifetime"
3862720,3870880," in seconds sex right so for how many seconds is going to exist and we're going to just assign this"
3870880,3876800," entire thing so we're going to maybe go to this section uh where we're going to have this kind of"
3876800,3884800," thing uh so we already have yeah so maybe this thing should be called hud pop-up lifetime in seconds"
3884800,3890080," and let's say that it's going to exist for maybe two seconds okay let's try to compile that and see"
3890080,3896800," where it complains so this is basically hud pop-up lifetime so the way we're going to handle that lifetime"
3896800,3902400," the way we're going to handle that lifetime when we're rendering each individual pop-up in a train"
3902400,3911600," right when we're rendering uh we can actually subtract the delta time the current data time from the"
3911600,3921200," lifetime of the pop-up right so we can actually grab the pop-up let's call it it uh right and gonna be ppt"
3921200,3930560," items uh right so p p t uh begin plus i right so begin this is where all these things begin and then"
3930560,3935600," i is an offset but here's an interesting thing that i've said can overflow so we have to be a little bit"
3935600,3942240," careful so we have to mod pop-up uh tray capacity like so and of course since it's a pointer we want"
3942240,3946400," to take a pointer so it's a little bit easier so we don't have to write this enormous expression every"
3946400,3951840," time we want to access the current pop-up maybe we want to tuck it behind some sort of a macro but i"
3951840,3956160," mean so we don't really have that many ring buffers right now so it's fine i'm going to keep it like"
3956160,3962800," this for now right and every time we are processing the pop-up and by the way in the future the text is"
3962800,3968080," going to be probably stored within the pop-up right so we're going to be doing something like uh it text"
3968080,3972320," and you're going to just run render the text that is in the pop-up right so different errors are going to"
3972320,3976800," have different texts and so on and so forth but for now we just have one single thing in here so it"
3976800,3982880," doesn't matter um right so and what we're going to be doing in here we're just taking the uh lifetime"
3982880,3990480," and we're subtracting the get frame time right so yeah we're just decrementing lifetime we're just"
3990480,3996080," simply decrementing the lifetime uh so maybe we can even extract that to a separate variable so it's going"
3996080,4002720," to be float dt and there we go so here is an interesting thing here's an interesting thing"
4002720,4010800," as we push uh the uh elements at at the beginning right so we're pushing them at the beginning and"
4010800,4018720," they start to age so because we're pushing them at the beginning they're going to start die out at the end"
4018720,4025040," they're always going to die out at the end since we're never actually inserting any pops ups new pop-ups"
4025040,4032800," in between so they're always going to fade away at the end right so what we can do we can introduce"
4032800,4038240," a concept of pop-up pruning sort of speak so essentially it's going to be the following thing"
4038240,4046560," it's going to be a loop that looks at the last the potentially oldest pop-up in the queue and if it's"
4046560,4054560," lifetime zero or less we just remove it from the queue and we keep removing it until we find alive pop-ups"
4055200,4061520," that way like over time they're going to just like disappear naturally and um you know deallocate the"
4061520,4069440," space for more future pop-ups right so because of the nature of how we push new pop-ups uh we can just"
4069440,4076080," keep pruning them at the end right does it does make sense hopefully that makes sense so uh and we can do"
4076080,4085840," that after we rendered the uh you know pop-up tray so essentially while ppt count is greater than zero"
4085840,4091440," we need to take a look at the last pop-up right we need to take a look at the last pop-up so how can we"
4091440,4100320," find the last pop-up we can take a look at the begin plus the count right so plus the count uh and minus"
4100320,4107840," one right because we need to find the last one and then we do p pt items and there we go that's the pop-up"
4107840,4118000," so this is sort of like a top pop-up right here's the thing uh if top pop-up lifetime is less or equal"
4118000,4124800," than zero well that just means that we can remove it and we can remove it by decrementing the count"
4124800,4132640," of all the pop-ups by one right and we just keep doing that until we ran out of pop-ups to to work with"
4133360,4139840," right and what's interesting is that if we encounter something that is not um you know alive"
4139840,4144560," right so that is actually has a lifetime greater than zero i think we should break"
4144560,4148720," out of the loop immediately right so i think that's what we have to do"
4148720,4156000," because of that we could have simplified the entire thing like that"
4159120,4166640," and lifetime is greater than zero right and just keep incrementing it i mean it's actually became"
4166640,4174080," simpler honestly right it's just the nature of how we work with the ring buffers it's kind of up"
4174080,4184800," right uh so we need to have maybe some sort of macros but i mean maybe that's fine maybe that's fine for now"
4186080,4192880," right so here we're sort of like pruning them we're sort of like pruning them uh okay so let's try to"
4192880,4197760," recompile this entire thing and i'm going to run this entire stuff i'm going to be running this entire"
4197760,4205040," stuff and i'm going to uh just add these things in here there we go and i'm going to try to load"
4205040,4213120," something that is not loadable and it disappeared right away disappeared right away but it appeared for a"
4213120,4220720," second but then it disappeared right away which is kind of funny not in the way uh all right which is"
4220720,4227680," kind of funny so let's try to find out what the is going on actually we have to do the following thing"
4227680,4233840," it has to be less or equal than zero so that's basically what happened that's why it disappeared right"
4233840,4241520," away let's reload and now i'm going to try this one more time it leaves for two seconds and then it should"
4241520,4246800," disappear we can actually keep doing that and they will start disappearing from the top"
4246800,4260160," uh and maybe in the future we're going to also say uh all right so what exactly the files that"
4260800,4271840," oh this one does not disappear anymore that is bizarre that is absolutely bizarre"
4271840,4275280," not disappearing anymore"
4275280,4278400," okay"
4283040,4284960," i don't know what it was it's kind of weird"
4284960,4293120," but anyway so one of the things we probably want to do right one of the things we probably want to do"
4293120,4302560," we want to actually fade them away right we want to fade them away uh how can we do that we can take"
4302560,4309360," the current lifetime right we can take the current lifetime and divide it by the maximum lifetime right"
4309360,4315040," so it's going to be hud pop-up lifetime sex right and that is going to be the value from zero to one which"
4315040,4322960," we can try to use as the uh as the alpha for the colors and stuff like that so let's actually put it into alpha"
4323760,4331600," like so and uh for example in here so in the ray leap i remember there was a color alpha yeah so which"
4331600,4339040," allows us to modify the current color and stuff like that so we can do uh color alpha right like so and"
4339040,4344560," this is just going to be alpha linear alpha scaling yeah linear alpha scaling well i mean we can make it"
4344560,4351760," like um quadratic or something like that to make it look better uh or something so we'll see we'll see"
4351760,4358720," uh and uh yeah this is going to be another one and let's go ahead and try to do that"
4358720,4365840," so i'm going to refresh everything and uh this thing is disappearing"
4370640,4383920," that is works surprisingly well what the i mean there we go we have a feature"
4383920,4394960," what the okay so we loaded some files and stuff and now if you try to load something that is not"
4394960,4400400," loadable could not load the file and it indicates it really well i think right"
4400640,4421280," uh maybe it should like exist for a second uh all right for a longer thing uh but let me let me think"
4421280,4430320," what we can do so maybe if we make it quadratic so it's gonna basically yeah so i think we need to make"
4430320,4433520," it quadratic all right i think we need to make it quadratic so"
4433520,4440880," uh i'm gonna take this thing and save it into t all right and i'm gonna make it square"
4440880,4450720," not is it quadratic yeah square i don't know i confused the terms i'm sorry uh okay so we're gonna do that"
4456640,4461200," uh we can try security maybe security is gonna be a little better for this one"
4461200,4474400," just trying to find the best look and feel for the whole thing uh right so let's just try to find"
4477920,4480640," uh yeah yeah so it stays for a second then quickly disappears"
4480640,4485040," is that better i think i think it's interesting"
4485040,4494000," um"
4494000,4503200," or maybe linear was okay i feel like linear was kind of okay in this specific situation let's actually keep it"
4503200,4510800," linear yeah i think linear was was better for this kind of stuff"
4510800,4517120," uh all right i wanted to like exist for a second"
4517120,4526800," mm-hmm and then start disappearing right so maybe it's going to be half of the lifetime it's always"
4527840,4538240," 100 percent and after the half of the life lifetime it's going to start fading out right um right"
4540400,4553120," it's going to start fading out uh and how we're going to approach that so essentially if t is um less than"
4553120,4558320," if t"
4558320,4568240," is greater than half maybe equal or greater than half uh we're gonna just say it's one otherwise otherwise"
4568800,4576000," otherwise is right smaller than one right it is smaller than one that means we need to divide it"
4576000,4582880," by half right divided by half and that's the alpha so it's gonna wait for half of the lifetime and gonna"
4582880,4588640," stay and then after the that is going to start fading out for a second so we have two seconds of"
4588640,4594160," lifetime so first second it just displays and then starts disappearing all right that could be an"
4594160,4599680," interesting approach i think that could be an interesting approach and i did a fucky wacky that's fine"
4599680,4608080," oopsie doopsie is totally expected in this specific situation uh totally expected right so let's actually"
4608080,4610080," refresh this entire stuff and let's go"
4610080,4615040," so for one second to exist and then disappears"
4619920,4620640," i think that's good"
4620640,4632000," all right so we can also do it in here all right so all that is visible that is good"
4632000,4641280," that is very very good so i achieved exactly what i wanted to achieve so i think that is actually pretty"
4641280,4647440," progress it was easier than i expected honestly right it was actually easier than expected so let me go"
4647440,4656240," through all the changes that i've done so we're using this pop-up thingy um right we're gonna try to use"
4656240,4665680," this pop-up thinking honestly i would like to even i have something that says could not load file and the"
4665680,4672080," name of the file but then i'll have to think how to feed that thing into the into the pop-up um right it"
4672080,4679600," would be cool to have a slide animation where it kind of slides into the view vertically and also next pop-up slides in"
4679600,4684560," with the previous pop-up slide yeah that would be cool actually uh that would be kind of cool"
4684560,4688480," how can we even do that"
4691840,4696880," so i'll need to think um so i'll need to think um all right so it has to be something it has to be"
4696880,4708240," something within um within pop-up tray push right within pop-up tray push and uh so this is not"
4708240,4715920," something uh specific to any particular pop-up this is something that"
4717600,4726000," is applicable to the whole tray so it's a state of the tray when we are ignoring the begin element"
4726560,4734160," and we're fading that begin element in but what if we receive messages too quickly what if we receive"
4734160,4739360," messages too quickly how do we accommodate that so we need to also take into the situation when"
4739360,4743920," a new message comes in while we animating the previous message"
4743920,4750800," that is basically one of the things we have to take into account that is actually very interesting"
4751360,4754480," uh very interesting problem that is actually very interesting"
4754480,4766400," notification starts where the cursor dropped the file then moves to the corner that is actually a"
4766400,4773600," very cool idea honestly all right because it makes it easier to for the user to notice right but again that"
4774480,4782240," requires more like additional work all right so this is a very complex behavior right it's a very complex"
4782240,4790080," behavior and we can accidentally go over time so uh but sliding like in and you think is something"
4790080,4795760," maybe doable within the current stream maybe um so"
4799360,4808240," let me let me let me maybe commit whatever we have already let me come to have already okay so"
4808240,4813200," introduce pop-up uh pop-up tray"
4813200,4820240," and uh so i think let me take a look at the diff i remember there was a to do in there yeah implement"
4820240,4826240," annoying pop-up that indicates that we could not load the file so this effectively is already done this"
4826240,4831920," effectively is already finished okay i really like that uh all right and i'm going to push that right"
4831920,4841040," into the repo i suppose so yeah um effectively a lot of like majority of the features that i want you to"
4841040,4846960," have before the next alpha release are already done i remember some of the other things i want you to have"
4846960,4853840," uh i want you to have like a tooltips for for the files and stuff like that so essentially if you have a"
4853840,4860000," a bunch of files in here uh when i hover over these sort of things i want you to have like a tooltips"
4860000,4866000," that show the full path or whatnot uh also i want you to have tooltips for the buttons in here that tell"
4866000,4870720," you what they do but maybe i'm going to leave that for the next releases right i don't know i kind of want"
4870720,4876640," to release the next alpha already i kind of want to release next alpha and i definitely didn't want to"
4876640,4883680," release unless i have this right because it's kind of weird to not at least tell the user that something"
4883680,4890000," went wrong right so it's kind of weird to not tell the user that something went wrong so there should"
4890000,4896800," be a way to tell the user there definitely should be something to tell them so maybe also uh it's kind of"
4896800,4908560," it's kind of short honestly it's kind of short so pop-up uh tray so what if i make it 250 if i make it 250."
4912000,4918160," so let me see oh that's actually good i think i think it's good"
4918160,4928240," so all right we can try to think how exactly we're going to be sliding in"
4930240,4940960," uh how exactly we're going to be sliding and so this is a pop pop uh tray so obviously we could say"
4940960,4946560," that we are"
4946560,4953120," we have some sort of additional parameter"
4955040,4963920," that indicates that we're sliding the element at items begin right so at items begin maybe it would"
4963920,4972400," make sense to finally have something like define um you know pop-up tray or maybe pt um you know begin"
4972400,4982960," uh maybe like first uh right so where you get the pt right where you get the pt and then you do pt"
4983840,4995360," items and just pt begin all right so it gives you that then we have last which is essentially pt begin"
4995360,4999360," plus the count"
4999360,5010880," mod the pop-up tray capacity so we really want to have this kind of sort of macros so we don't have to do this"
5010880,5017520," kind of stuff ourselves at the time furthermore we can even have assertions right so this kind of stuff"
5017520,5027440," is not um you know feasible if the count is equal to zero but you can't do that if the count is equal"
5027440,5033280," zero so we assume that the count is actually rather than zero so i think that's quite important so we can"
5033280,5039600," have a little bit of a range checks to make this entire stuff a little bit more safe so on top of that we can"
5039600,5053120," have pt get right so pt index and this one is also very important to be within the range right so index"
5053120,5060960," is less than pt count right so this is going to be that uh and then what are we doing here um"
5062560,5073040," we just do it we just do it like that uh so yeah so this is a pt count actually minus one but here uh"
5073040,5083280," we have to do an index and here is an interesting thing here is an interesting thing we can re-implement pt"
5083280,5095600," first in pt last in terms of pt get right so we can always do pt get pt uh right so pt pt uh actually just"
5095600,5106000," zero right so this is zero right so this is zero and then last is pt get uh pt pt count but minus one"
5106000,5109440," right so that is expanded automatically um"
5109440,5117520," right so and now we have these kind of things and we don't have to think about how to extract information"
5117520,5123120," out of this ring buffer right so all of that is abstracted away with macros everyone loves macros"
5123120,5133120," macros the uh you know fix a lot of errors and stuff like that so uh all right so and essentially when a"
5133120,5145760," right um when a is greater than zero we know that we're animating pt first right so we're animating pt"
5145760,5152880," first so we're not kind of displaying it or we are displaying it with a special offset"
5153280,5156320," right so we're displaying it with a special offset"
5156320,5165280," um yeah and so the problem starts to oh this one is good actually"
5165280,5175520," i think i even know how to solve this kind of i think i even know how to solve this kind of"
5175520,5184080," we need to introduce uh right we need to introduce the time for how long uh we're gonna slide in the"
5184080,5188560," whole thing right so for how long we're sliding in the whole thing so we already have hud pop-up"
5188560,5200240," lifetime sec uh right so we can introduce hud pop-up slide in sex how quickly you're gonna slide in so"
5200240,5206720," sliding in has to be faster than fading out obviously right it has to be faster than fading out so i think"
5206720,5212400," sliding in for 200 milliseconds is fine right i think it is it is good right"
5214480,5226160," and uh yep so pop-up tray so we can even call it slide so and we know then when the slide is zero"
5226160,5242960," there's no sliding in right so uh there's no sliding in if slide is greater so this is the sort of"
5242960,5250320," interpolator that we use to slide everything right so that's that's the interpolator that we use um okay"
5251520,5260960," and when we do pop-up tray push we're pushing a new thing we're pushing a new thing so when we're pushing"
5260960,5276800," a new thing i also do p pt slide hud pop-up sliding sex right so that's what they do uh and over time when we're drawing"
5276800,5285200," the pop-up train when we're drawing the pop-up train uh we're also um we can even say something like this"
5285200,5302000," if uh slide is greater than zero if it is greater than zero we basically subtract dt if it's less than zero"
5303360,5311920," right uh if it's less than zero we sort of like a stabilize it right so we make it equal to zero"
5311920,5325600," we sort of make it uh equal to zero we make it equal to zero and here is an interesting thing"
5327680,5335440," here is an interesting thing so effectively this has something to do with the x coordinate"
5335440,5344640," this has something to do with x coordinate so we can take p pt slide and divide it by that global value"
5344640,5353760," which is the hud pop-up uh pop-up i said uh not lifetime sliding sex right so there's this kind of"
5353760,5358240," interpolator and um essentially"
5358240,5370800," the bigger it is the more down we have to bring the whole thing so yeah this is something like that"
5370800,5380160," so the bigger it is effectively we can save it like this so this is going to be t okay so we already have t"
5381440,5389440," what if we say this is q and this is an additional offset by which we have to bring this down"
5389440,5399520," this is actually so simple and so genius isn't it"
5399520,5405440," okay i don't really use this macros yet but maybe i should start using them at some point"
5405440,5417200," there's there so okay that didn't work why didn't did i actually re refresh i think"
5417200,5427680," well okay so from from a different side from a different side we have to do that from a different"
5427680,5434080," side so that means we have to i think subtract this thing i'm gonna sneeze by the way so get ready"
5436400,5440720," debate it so long we've been waited"
5440720,5455520," who's the god cuder in here"
5461120,5465520," so but what if you have too many of them that you can't load"
5465520,5473760," it jumps by one anyway so it's designed to jump by one anyway"
5473760,5489680," but wait a second what if ptslide bigger than the maximum thing it's gonna offset more than one slot"
5491120,5503360," trade push what if instead of assigning this thing we add it for each thing we add"
5503360,5507120," it's gonna offset it even further"
5507120,5513840," why is this why is it so freaking wait a freaking second"
5516480,5519120," so i didn't expect that such thing"
5519120,5535280," so yeah i mean maybe we want to actually do that behind the preview thing right preview actually does"
5535280,5541840," the scissors right it does the scissors maybe we want to put that behind the scissors of the preview so"
5541840,5550640," preview uh boundary so i think it was somewhere if p uh full screen and within this thing we have scissors"
5550640,5559520," okay so that that makes sense we want to move the pop-up tray behind those scissors right we're moving"
5559520,5575760," it behind those scissors so now uh right we're doing this kind of thing so i'm going to refresh this entire stuff and now uh so it's not going to be visible yeah look at that so it's behind the scissors"
5578240,5586000," uh and on top of that it's kind of yeah what's funny is that if it fades away for too long does it start"
5586000,5592080," yeah yeah that's so freaking cool so it has to be faster it has to slide in even faster than that"
5592960,5598960," all right so what about uh you know 50 milliseconds super fast"
5598960,5606960," all right and now so it's actually"
5606960,5614800," slides in very fast it's a flight slides in very fast but the reason why it slides in very fast is so"
5614800,5616000," you know it can do this kind of it can do this kind of shit"
5616000,5624880," is that a good idea so maybe it's too it's too fast right so what about just one um"
5624880,5629280," okay so"
5629280,5633840," so did it did it update anything"
5633840,5639040," yeah so i think i feel like it is there"
5641600,5646000," hmm"
5646000,5650000," oh yeah"
5650000,5654640," i think this is a good system"
5654640,5661680," i think this is a good system this is actually super cool right and we can you know work with that"
5661680,5666560," we can improve with look and feel and stuff like i didn't expect that sliding in is going to be that"
5666560,5670000," easy to implement especially when you have too many things coming in very quickly"
5670640,5676640," right so yeah i guess we did that so that's very cool"
5676640,5685920," all right um so that's the power of simplicity people that's the power of simplicity it's that"
5685920,5690400," simple not because i'm somehow considering myself a god quarter or anything like that"
5690400,5694560," because i have little staying in front of me in staying in my way"
5695520,5700160," right and it's just a road dog in the ui and it's just that fucking simple isn't that cool i think it's"
5700160,5707360," pretty freaking cool we just should not be afraid of simplicity you should not be afraid of simplicity"
5708560,5718160," okay okay okay okay implement uh implement uh implement pull pop tray uh tray sliding in"
5718160,5723200," sliding in right i'm gonna push that right into the repo"
5723200,5730320," already ran out of t already ran out of t already ran out of t so"
5734560,5739920," if only you knew how hard it is to do something like that like this in react but i i'm pretty sure"
5739920,5743040," there's a library for that just like import the library or something"
5745120,5752880," uh so i'm pretty sure there's a library it's pretty cool especially in the tutorial right and then you"
5752880,5761440," manage to load it in and there you go and it's working and it's working here as well and they're"
5761440,5767760," sharing actually their sort of state so i can just do something like that and i can switch between full"
5767760,5773040," full screen it's it's sort of the same state uh right so that's pretty cool"
5773040,5778640," right so and yeah"
5778640,5786640," doing something like that in react is way easier especially doing fft and stuff like that"
5787200,5808160," uh so so and i also coded this thing myself from scratch uh using shaders and stuff like that"
5808160,5814160," so"
5814160,5841120," all right so i guess that's it for today thanks who's watching marina i really appreciate it"
5841120,5849840," have a good one and i see you all on the next recreation programming session with amista azuzin i love you"
