640,7440," Looks like we're live. Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session"
7440,13120," with Mr. Zuzin. Hello, hello everyone. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Let's make a little bit of an"
13120,19200," announcement on our Discord server. Right, so I'm going to do a red circle for better visual"
19200,26800," representation of what we're doing live on Twitch. And what are we doing today on twitch.tv? Yes,"
27600,33040," top level domain dot tv means television. There is nothing you can say to convince me otherwise,"
33040,40400," it means dot television. And today we're doing a web dev in assembly. Right, that's right. So I'm"
40400,46640," going to give the link where we're doing all that, https, twitch.tv/todding. And I'm going to ping"
46640,51440," everyone who's interested in being pinged. And there we go, the stream has officially started."
51440,55440," Hello, hello everyone. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Really glad to see you all today."
56160,64720," So today I would like to explore a very interesting assembler, right, which is called flat assembler."
64720,73680," So it's very interesting how much underrated it is. When people do assembler, they usually think about"
73680,83040," things like NASM, right, so I don't really know how it is translated. It's something like, it's not that NASM, god"
83040,89200," damn it. It's this one, net wide assembler, right. So I forgot what N stands for. And some people maybe think"
89200,95680," about things like gas, which is a GNU assembler, and stuff like that. But flat assembler is actually,"
97040,102560," like, nobody really heard about it. But it's a very interesting assembler. It's a very interesting"
102560,107840," assembler. So let's actually try to explore that assembler a little bit. I'm going to do a probe,"
107840,113200," and, uh, so I'm going to do fuzz them. Uh, yeah, I'm going to just put fuzz them. So essentially, we can"
113200,120320," take a look at the executable itself. I think the executable itself is rather interesting, right. So,"
120320,126960," uh, which fuzz them? Uh, it's located in user bin because it comes in the, in the repos of the Debian,"
126960,133360," right. So I'm using Debian as a distro. And we can just, like, go ahead and simply copy-paste that"
133360,139760," executable. Literally copy-pasting that executable, uh, to, to here, right. So it's a relatively small"
139760,146400," executable, about 142 kilobytes and stuff like that. But what's interesting is that it's, um, um,"
146400,153360," oh, it's actually not a statically linked executable. So it does, in fact, depends on libc."
153360,162640," This is something unexpected. Because, uh, if you, for example, write a hello world in fuzzm, right,"
162640,168480," if you write ""hello world"" in fuzzm. So let's actually google that fuzzm, flat assembly, elf 64 example."
168480,174480," There we go. Yeah, there we go. So if we just take this entire thing, uh, and just do something like"
174480,183440," ""hello, uh, awesome"". So format elf 64. Do I even have a fuzzm, uh, fuzzm mode? I don't even have a fuzzm mode."
183440,191920," So let me, let me maybe find the fuzzm mode for Emacs. I remember there was, like, some very simple fuzzm mode that we could"
191920,197440," probably steal, uh, from somewhere. I think I'm going to do a very straightforward thing. I'm going to just,"
197440,206480," like, do the chat move. I'm going to download this entire thing, uh, like so. And simply, uh, open this"
206480,213600," entire stuff and evaluate the buffer. Evaluate the buffer and then essentially take my ""hello world"""
213600,218880," awesome. And that, uh, should allow me to just enable fuzzm mode. There we go. I have a fuzzm mode."
218880,226240," No package manager involved. No anything. I just downloaded the file. I just executed it in my Emacs,"
226240,232560," and there we go. It just works. Right. So, no fuzz, no package managers or anything like that. It just,"
232560,241600," like, it just works. So we need to produce elf 64 executable. Uh, right. And essentially, usually, what you have in, uh,"
241600,247920," Linux applications, you usually have two segments. One segment is, uh, executable that holds the,"
247920,252480," that holds the code. Right. So this is where you can have the code with instructions and stuff like"
252480,259040," that. And one segment, uh, that is readable, writable, which holds the data. Usually, you want to use this"
259040,263040," segment for strings and stuff like that. So, for instance, you want to have a message. You want to"
263040,269360," print hello world. So you basically allocate, uh, a bunch of bytes. And those bytes represent hello world."
269360,274320," Uh, world. Right. So, and essentially, you probably want to put a new line at the end of the string. So you put 10."
274320,281360," So, uh, and this is going to be stored in this, um, you know, readable, writable section, literally in the, in a data"
281600,286560," in a data section. Right. So then, uh, you want to define your entry point, like where the program"
286560,291120," starts. We want to do something like entry main. Uh, and this is where the program is going to start."
291120,296240," And essentially, to write a hello world in assembler, what you need to do, you need to perform two syscalls."
296240,304640," Two syscalls. Syscall is essentially user program asking an operating system, do something for me,"
304640,311360," do something that I personally, as a user program, as a pleb program, cannot do. For example, uh, writing"
311360,317120," into standard output. User programs in Linux, they cannot write into the standard output. They can only"
317120,324720," ask operating system. Okay. I have this string. Could you please write this thing into the standard output?"
324720,333760," Right. So, and the way you call a syscall, the way you ask operating system is by using, uh, the syscall"
333760,342800," instruction that comes with x86 64. So x86 64, uh, has a specific instruction for asking operating"
342800,347520," system to do shit for, for the program. Right. It was designed to have an operating system. At least,"
347520,352320," this is how I personally understand it. Maybe it's completely wrong. I'm not a low level person."
352320,359840," I know it's hard to believe, but I'm not a low level person. Right. I'm not really that knowledgeable in"
359840,366400," these, like, uh, low level assemblies and stuff like that. So, but this is just my, you know, high level"
366400,372640," Java, Java developer understanding of how all of these things works. Right. So this is a specific instruction."
372640,381440," And, uh, essentially it will just jump to the kernel. But, uh, how do you say exactly what kind of syscall"
381440,388480," do you want to call? Uh, right. So you have to put the number of the syscall into the RACS register."
388480,394560," You know, as we all know, the CPUs have a bunch of registers. X86 64 has, uh, you know, a lot of"
394560,400800," different registers and stuff like that. Some of them overlap, uh, right. So for example, RACS also overlap"
400800,408480," with EAX and also overlap with AX, which also overlaps with BL, AL and so on and so forth."
408480,413280," Right. So this is basically to preserve backward compatibility and stuff like that. So you need to"
413280,419920," put the number of the syscall that you want to, uh, you know, call to RACS. So, uh, on the internet,"
419920,426160," there is a pretty cool table of the system calls, right? So it's, um, it's provided by Chromium OS,"
426160,431440," right? So if you do Chromium, uh, Chromium Linux syscalls, you will instantly find that because"
431440,437120," Chromium OS is basically Linux. So all of the Linux syscalls, they actually work there. So this is the"
437120,442560," thing that usually flows on top and it's very convenient and it's like very like more or less up to date."
446160,451600," Maybe I should not use it. Maybe I should use this one. There, maybe there is a more fresh version."
451600,458640," Uh, so yeah, maybe we should use the fresh version, but there we go. So it's x86-64. So I'm going to"
458640,464080," actually copy paste this entire thing in here. Uh, right. So I'm going to copy paste this entire thing"
464080,469680," in here. And, uh, also in the description, this thing is going to be available. Right. So what we want"
469680,475920," to do, we want to perform a write syscall. So here's the write syscall. The number of a write syscall"
475920,485280," is 1. It is 1. So let's go ahead and literally put 1 into rex. And it literally corresponds to a"
485280,492000," function write from POSIX. It literally corresponds to that. By doing a syscall write, you're literally"
492000,497520," calling this function. So the next thing you have to do, you have to provide three arguments: the file"
497520,503600," descriptor, the pointer to the buffer, and the size of the buffer. How do you provide such arguments when you"
503600,509200," perform a syscall in assembly? You provide it also through a registers. And there is a call convention"
509200,518960," in Linux x86-64 that says that the first argument of a call is going into RDI, the second one is going"
518960,526000," to in RSI, and the third one into RDX. Right. So you can actually provide more up to, I suppose,"
526000,531520," six arguments. And you have to use this specific instruction in here. Since we have only three"
531520,538240," arguments, we only need RDI, RSI, and RDX. So let's go ahead and do that. So RDI. So what we need to move"
538240,544960," into RDI, we have to move the file descriptor. So the standard output is one, if I'm not mistaken."
544960,552400," Right. So the standard, I think, I think it is. I think it's, I think it's just one. Right. So the next"
552400,556400," thing we have to provide, we have to provide the buffer. So, and the pointer to the buffer is the"
556400,562800," message. And the size of the buffer goes into RDX. And the way you compute the size of the buffer, you can"
562800,568640," actually basically hard call it. It's not that big of a deal. Right. So 13 characters plus a new line,"
568640,573920," we can put 14 in here and that will work. But there are better ways to do that. Right. And that's it."
573920,585520," So that is literally equivalent to doing right one, one, hello world, 14. And not even like that. So more"
585520,594240," like this. Right. So that's what it's equivalent to. So, and yeah, so we just did a call right. And"
594240,600960," the next thing you have to do, you have to do a syscall to exit. Right. So what's the ID of the exit"
600960,607600," syscall? So we can also look it up in the table. So if you find exit, it's actually 60. Right. So it's"
607600,614240," actually 60. So we have to put 60 in here. And in RDI goes the exit code. Right. So you have to put zero"
614240,619760," in here and call this syscall. And that is it. So that's basically hello world. In assembly using"
619760,626240," exit 664 syscalls for Linux. You just perform two calls. This is literally how you would do on"
626240,632240," like in C as well. It's just like a single syscall requires these sort of preparations. But"
632240,637280," apart from that, everything is pretty straightforward. You have L file. L file consists of two sections."
637280,643040," The one holds the data. Another one holds the code. The one that holds the code is executable. The one"
643040,648240," that holds the data is writable. I'm not sure if it needs to be writable. But I guess it's fine."
648240,655760," Right. I guess it's fine. So the next thing you do, you do phasm.hello.asm. And there you go."
655760,665040," It wrote 236 bytes. So this is a file. 236 bytes. Right. And it is hello. So, and interestingly enough, if you take a look at this file, it will say that it's a file."
665040,670240," It's an L file. It's a file of 236 bytes. Right. And it's not even executable. So one of the things you have to do, you have to mark it as an executable. So I just marked it as an executable."
670240,676560," You can try to run this in that thing. And it says hello world."
676560,682880," And executable is more than the source. Yeah, exactly. And it produces, like, actually small static executables. Right. So we can take a look inside of it. And there you go. It's an L file."
682880,691200," It's a legit L file. There is some binary stuff, which is probably the code. And at the end, we have our hello world string."
691200,698800," And it's a legit L file. And it's a legit L file. And there's some binary stuff, which is probably the code. And at the end, we have our hello world string."
698800,706320," So we can take a look inside of it. And there you go. It's an L file. It's a legit L file. There is some binary stuff, which is probably the code."
706320,711360," And at the end, we have our hello world string. So we can take a look inside of it. And we can take a look inside of it."
711360,724120," And we have our hello world string. And that's a self-contained, small, alpha executable that only uses Linux syscalls. And it will probably work on your machine as well, on any distro, if you have a Linux kernel."
724120,739840," So because it doesn't depend on libc and stuff like that. And you know what's interesting about Fuzzm? You know what's interesting about Fuzzm is that we can Google it up, like Fuzzm source code. So let's actually find. So what's the language"
739840,746640," it's written in. So what's the language it's written in? It's written in itself."
746640,752600," This motherfucker is written in itself and it's self-hosted."
752600,756480," I'm going to give you the source code of this entire stuff, right? So I'm going to put it in here."
756480,767600," Right. So I already started because it's such an awesome project. And of course, I'm going to put that in the description as well. So it's a very small thing that produces other small executables that work."
768320,779120," And it's self-hosted. And here's the thing. So the reason why I wanted to look into the executable is that I thought maybe it's basically linked and compiled"
779120,785920," the same way as it compiles other executables. So I thought that maybe the Fuzzm itself is going to be,"
787120,797920," you know, static. Right. But specifically on my machine, it is not. It is actually dynamically linked with libc. I have no idea"
797920,815920," why. Does it really use libc? I don't remember it really using libc. Because I remember a long time ago trying to compile Fuzzm from scratch using this source code. And it produced like a static executable. Why this specific thing links with libc? I don't really know."
815920,824720," Maybe it's something it has something to do with the maintainers of this thing. Maybe the maintainers of Debian just compile it this way."
824720,842720," So, yeah. But by itself, Fuzzm just produces these static small executables, which I really like. It's kind of a cool idea to have some small little thing with which you can experiment and stuff like that and explore the low-level world and everything."
842720,851520," So, and what do we need to do today? Right. So, Fuzzm, even though it's very simplistic, it's very small."
851520,873320," So, it has a macro capabilities, right? So, it has a macro capabilities. One of the macro capabilities it has, it can, for example, have a compile time constants, like message length, right, equals, where you can say, okay, so take me the address at the current line, like dollar, and do minus msg."
873320,884120," Okay. And essentially, you have the length of the message, so you can just use like a message len. And if you modify this specific thing, you don't have a hard-coded value anymore."
884120,903920," This is nothing special, like a lot of assemblies have stuff like that. Right. But furthermore, you can have a lot of other interesting things. For instance, you can create a macro substitution, very convenient ones, where you can essentially say, okay, like, I don't want to call right syscall like that."
903920,916760," I want to be able to just, you know, call it like I do in C. And in that case, you can do macro, right, and let's say you accept these things that the right syscall actually accepts, right? So, it accepts FD, buffer, and count."
916760,932840," So, we can say FD, buffer, and count. Right. So, and essentially, you just take this entire thing and copy-paste it in here. Right. So, syscall is hard-coded. It's going to be one RDI, FD, buffer, and count. Right."
932920,939000," And in here, instead of doing, like, move, syscall, and stuff like that, you'll do write one message, message len."
939000,961920," So, maybe Nazem also has something like that, but the selling point of FASM is that it's so simplistic, so small. Right. So, I can do just FASM like this. And there we go. It still works. And if I call this entire thing, call this hello world, it's still full bar. Right. So, I changed hello world to full bar. So, it got reflected in the output."
961920,970420," So, I can do that one more time. And this is hello. Right. And I can do the same thing with exit. Right. So, I can do macro exit. And here, I'm supposed to accept the code."
970900,982140," And essentially, here, I can now move this entire thing to here. So, this is going to be the code. And then I'm going to say exit 0. And this already looks like a freaking C."
984080,998220," So, when people say that C is very close to assembly, this is literally what they mean. This is literally what people mean when they say that C is very close to assembly. Right. It's just like one step away from C."
1000000,1008520," So, yeah. It's like one step away from C. And, yeah. Now, it's more readable. Right. So, I don't have to try to parse this kind of stuff."
1008520,1014400," I can just tuck it away behind the macros. And it essentially works. Maybe I can do the following things."
1014460,1021340," So, for instance, I can have a set of constants like C is right, which is going to be one. Right. So, and I'm going to just do it like that."
1021340,1029920," C is right. And here, we can have a C is exit. And it's going to be C is exit 60. There we go."
1030600,1038720," So, now I have all of the constants that I usually have. Then all of that stuff. And I can just, like, program like this. And it is very, very convenient."
1038720,1045080," So, you can go even further, as far as I know. Right. So, there is an article in here in flat assembly."
1045080,1056240," So, understanding the flat assembly. So, they're basically going into more like a philosophical part of fuzz."
1056240,1065260," This is Fuzzm, by the way. This is Fuzzm. Right. So, they're going into more of a philosophical part of programming in Fuzzm."
1065260,1070080," And essentially, what they say is that Fuzzm is not particularly an assembler."
1070080,1078620," They say that Fuzzm is an interpreter that outputs assembly code."
1079860,1089220," Fuzzm is not a compiler. It's an interpreted language, the side effect of which is outputting the binary."
1089220,1095680," That's how you're supposed to think about it. And they explain that from the philosophical, ideological point of view."
1095680,1097580," And this is actually super cool. I really like that."
1097940,1108560," So, they say that these assembly instructions are, in fact, just right to the standard output command that outputs that specific instruction."
1108560,1110460," That's what they are."
1110460,1115540," And because of that, one of the things you can do, you can do things like this."
1115540,1117080," You can say, repeat five."
1118500,1126340," So, essentially, what this thing does, it literally copy-paste the code between these brackets five times."
1126340,1130900," So, essentially, what we can do, we can say, okay, do write five times."
1130900,1132880," So, it's not going to be a runtime loop."
1132880,1135000," It's a compile-time loop."
1135000,1137140," It's a compile-time loop."
1137140,1139560," Right. So, and we can do something like this."
1139560,1141940," And as you can see, it says, hello world, five times."
1143360,1144220," How does it work?"
1144220,1146940," It literally copy-pasted this thing five times."
1146940,1151700," And this thing five times got expanded into five write syscalls."
1151700,1155280," So, it's more like a pre-processor."
1155280,1157200," Right. It's more like a pre-processor."
1157200,1161040," And you can actually have a lot of complicated things in here."
1161040,1167400," So, in fact, the thing I did in here, the thing I did in here, is actually a compile-time variable."
1167400,1170720," It is, in reality, a compile-time variable."
1170860,1175680," So, you can do things like x equal one."
1175680,1181600," And then, at some point here, you can say, okay, x now equal x plus two."
1181600,1184820," So, at this point, x is going to be equal three."
1184820,1186660," So, x is going to be equal three."
1186660,1188060," You can use x in here."
1188060,1191000," And as you can see, there will be three hello worlds in here."
1191000,1194640," So, this is an interpreted language."
1195340,1200500," It's an interpreted language, the side effect of which is outputting assembly instructions."
1200500,1203360," Not assembly instructions, but machine instructions."
1203360,1207660," So, and it also has if conditions."
1207660,1208600," It has loops."
1208600,1211540," You can do a lot of interesting shit in it."
1211540,1213360," I do not fully understand it."
1214040,1215440," I do not fully understand it."
1215440,1218800," And this is something that I would like to explore today, actually."
1219580,1229020," And furthermore, I had literally the same idea a very long time ago when I was working on BM."
1229020,1230900," Who remembers BM, by the way?"
1230900,1232020," Do you guys remember BM?"
1232020,1233740," Virtual machine?"
1233740,1235160," Virtual machine, I don't know."
1235460,1243720," So, essentially, the idea of BM was to create, like, a virtual machine with its own bytecode, with its own assembly."
1243720,1250160," But on top of assembly, we have sort of, like, a preprocessor that allows you to generate it more efficiently."
1250160,1252400," And we can take a look at some of the things in here."
1252400,1255020," So, bots, and maybe there are some still examples."
1255020,1257260," Okay, so there are some examples in here."
1258500,1261340," So, yeah, there is a SDL, maybe."
1261340,1263680," Yeah, okay."
1263680,1266720," So, you could have constants like this, right?"
1266720,1272500," So, the compile time directives, they are prefixed with percent."
1272500,1274760," You can have constants in here."
1274760,1275940," You can have, like, scopes."
1275940,1278640," You can have for loops in here, right?"
1278640,1282660," So, you can have for loops in here and stuff like that."
1282660,1294680," So, like, I explored, tried to explore this idea a long time ago, but not with x86 assembly, but with my own made-up assembly, with my own made-up virtual machine."
1294680,1298100," And, apparently, I'm not the only one who got this idea."
1298100,1300280," I'm not the only one who got this idea."
1300280,1304000," But on top of that, FASM is a very old assembly, right?"
1304000,1305500," It's been around for ages."
1305500,1307700," It's been around for ages."
1307700,1313840," And the community, the FASM community, is actually extremely active."
1313840,1316540," They're not really that well-known, right?"
1316540,1324640," So, they're not being sort of, like, these glamorous swag developers that tweet memes on Twitter and stuff like that."
1324640,1326360," They're just, like, really little-known."
1326360,1327720," They're just doing their own things."
1327720,1334740," But over the years of existing, this community created, for example, their own operating system entirely in FASM."
1335540,1338300," They made their own operating system entirely in FASM."
1338300,1343200," So, operating system in FASM."
1343200,1345220," I think it's Minuet or something."
1345220,1350000," I don't know how it's spelled, but maybe the Google will actually show me."
1350000,1352480," So, does anyone remember how it is called, right?"
1352480,1355260," I remember it starts with Minuet."
1355260,1356620," How do you spell it?"
1356620,1357980," Yeah, Minuet OS."
1357980,1358300," Yeah."
1358300,1360900," So, they created this thing."
1360900,1362960," So, it's written entirely in FASM."
1364200,1367740," And it makes you wonder, like, how did they manage to do that?"
1367740,1371860," How did they manage to create, like, an entire operating system that looks like this, by the way?"
1371860,1375800," It looks like this is the operating system that is written in FASM."
1375800,1378260," How did they manage to do that in assembly?"
1378260,1381360," The scariest language on planet Earth."
1381700,1387260," All of the memes on Reddit, on programming humor, saying that it's a very hard language and you should never program on it."
1387260,1387760," How?"
1387760,1389080," How is such language?"
1389080,1392040," How is even possible to use this language to create and purchase it?"
1392040,1392920," But they managed to do it."
1392920,1394800," They managed to do that somehow."
1395380,1397860," So, maybe the Reddit propaganda was wrong?"
1397860,1398920," Maybe."
1398920,1399900," Maybe it was wrong?"
1399900,1405540," So, I suppose the way they did that is because they had a very powerful preprocessor, I think."
1405540,1408480," So, which allows you to basically program in C."
1408480,1411260," So, yeah."
1411260,1412800," That's probably how they do that."
1412800,1416740," So, maybe at some point I'm going to go just to read the source code of this entire thing."
1416740,1418720," That would be interesting, I think."
1419500,1420440," That would be interesting."
1420440,1427400," But anyway, so I'm going to give the link to this operating system, right, for anyone who's interested."
1427400,1429820," And the latest release."
1429820,1434520," Look at the date of the latest release."
1434520,1437480," It was this month."
1437480,1438280," I mean, come on."
1438280,1441420," How active is it?"
1441420,1443540," Like, people still do that, right?"
1443540,1446300," So, this community is very much active."
1446300,1448880," This community is very much active."
1449500,1457280," So, they just don't bother with cloud or anything like that because they genuinely like programming for the sake of doing programming."
1457280,1460740," So, right."
1460740,1463360," So, let me actually put this thing in here."
1463360,1464400," So, you know what it has."
1464400,1465640," All right."
1465640,1466640," What I want you to do."
1466640,1470080," I want you to explore FOSM a little bit closer."
1470080,1472280," A little bit more intimate."
1472280,1473200," Right?"
1473200,1475280," So, and one of the things I want you to do."
1475280,1477660," I want you to write like a simple website in it."
1477660,1477900," Right?"
1478300,1482260," So, essentially, I already did stuff like that before on a very low-level language."
1482260,1488060," So, essentially, what you do, you create a socket using Linux syscalls, right?"
1488060,1494440," So, by the way, all these socket API of Linux maps one-to-one to their syscalls, right?"
1494440,1499700," Things like, for example, I think we can do socket, right?"
1499700,1503040," So, things like socket that creates the socket."
1503040,1508320," Things like bind that binds the socket to a particular port and stuff like that."
1508320,1510980," They have corresponding syscalls."
1510980,1518120," And, furthermore, on Linux, on the current versions of Linux, even the sizes of the structures actually match."
1518620,1522780," These things are basically entirely implemented in the Linux kernel."
1522780,1528380," So, you don't even need standard libc to use this API."
1528380,1531260," because you can use it directly, right?"
1531260,1533720," So, it is very dangerous to use it directly."
1533720,1537920," A lot of people will tell you, especially the people who like to masturbate to undefine behavior,"
1537920,1542700," they will tell you, you're not supposed to depend on this thing because they can change at any point."
1542700,1544180," You're supposed to use libc."
1546180,1549720," Ignoring the fact that libc breaks their own ABI all the time, right?"
1549720,1554240," So, well, anyway, I usually tend to ignore such people."
1554240,1555460," Right."
1555460,1556960," So, you can just use this thing directly."
1556960,1560740," So, and, yeah, this is what I want to do today."
1560740,1569560," I just want to see how easy or difficult it is to do something like that specifically in FASM, right?"
1569560,1570300," Simple website."
1570300,1574080," Just, like, you know, open a port, listen to that specific port."
1574080,1578400," If you have a connection, just respond with a hard-coded HTTP response"
1578400,1581640," and close the connection and wait for the next one."
1581640,1583520," It's a very simple algorithm, in fact."
1583520,1585320," It's a very simple algorithm."
1585320,1588720," So, yeah, that's the topic of today's stream."
1588720,1589900," Half of an hour intro."
1589900,1590860," How about that?"
1590860,1597660," So, let's go ahead and try to write a simple, you know, simple HTTP server, right?"
1597660,1598700," A simple TCP server."
1598700,1602420," I think I'm going to continue working in here."
1602420,1605340," So, I'm going to rename this entire thing into website, right?"
1605340,1606400," So, this is going to be website."
1606400,1608600," There's, we're not going to have hello in here."
1608600,1613460," And, essentially, let me maybe remove all of that stuff in here."
1613460,1614720," We're not going to have a repeat."
1614720,1617060," And I'm going to do FASM mode."
1617060,1619980," So, message."
1619980,1624080," So, do we want to print, actually, any message?"
1624160,1626680," We can actually say that this is start."
1626680,1630900," So, this is a start message and this is a start message."
1630900,1637300," We can say starting web, web site."
1637300,1639980," Starting website."
1639980,1641260," Maybe web server."
1641260,1644120," Starting web server."
1644680,1648520," And I'm going to just compile website."
1648520,1651000," Boom."
1651000,1652520," And some..."
1652520,1652780," Oh, yeah."
1652780,1653180," There we go."
1653180,1654860," So, I forgot to rename this thing."
1654860,1657260," So, permission denied."
1657260,1659400," And this is because you have to make it executable."
1659400,1662520," What's funny is that you have to make it executable only once."
1662520,1667020," After that, you don't have to make it executable over and over again, right?"
1667080,1672040," So, I suppose this is because when you regenerate the executable, it doesn't delete the file."
1672040,1674260," It probably just truncates the file."
1674260,1679180," So, and I suppose truncated the file doesn't mess the permissions of the file."
1679180,1683780," It's kind of funny that they implemented a lot of cool, sophisticated chat."
1683780,1687620," But they didn't bother to make the output executable."
1687620,1690120," Which is..."
1690120,1693020," Which maybe makes sense, right?"
1693020,1695820," If we look at it from the philosophical point of view,"
1695820,1698120," This is not really a compiler."
1698120,1699860," This is not really an assembler."
1699860,1701000," It's an interpreter."
1701000,1704720," It's an interpreter that outputs binaries."
1704720,1706480," That outputs binaries."
1706480,1710740," So, what it does, it just like redirects its output to a file."
1710740,1714960," And it's up to you how you want to actually interpret it."
1714960,1717040," You want to interpret it as an executable thing."
1717040,1719340," Well, yeah, it's up to you to make it executable, right?"
1719340,1723340," So, it's not the job of FASM to interpret it in a certain way."
1723340,1725700," It's job to just output binaries."
1725820,1727820," And you do whatever the fuck you want with it."
1727820,1728820," Right."
1728820,1730860," So, you ask it to be ELF64."
1730860,1731760," There you go."
1731760,1732800," Here is ELF64."
1732800,1734320," Oh, you want it executed?"
1734320,1736060," Well, I mean, just do whatever you want."
1736060,1738400," Like, who am I to tell you what to do?"
1738400,1738960," I mean, right?"
1745700,1749000," Anyways, so, this is a start message."
1749000,1752500," And after the start message, what we have to do, we have to create le socket."
1752500,1755880," We must create le socket."
1755880,1757820," So, we'll go ahead and do that."
1757820,1758780," Right."
1758920,1760900," So, where is the socket?"
1760900,1764720," Where is the socket syscall?"
1764720,1766080," Here it is."
1766080,1771140," So, let's go ahead and create the macro for this socket syscall."
1771140,1776840," I'm going to think, I think I'm going to just put it as a comment and we're going to have a macro."
1776840,1778580," So, le socket."
1778580,1780180," We're going to accept the domain."
1780180,1781200," We're going to accept the type."
1781200,1782520," We're going to accept the protocol."
1783240,1787560," And in here, right, so, the usual thing is going to be move racks."
1787560,1790060," So, we're supposed to have, like, a syssocket."
1790060,1794400," So, but what's the ID of syssocket?"
1794400,1796100," That's a very interesting question."
1796100,1797940," We can just look it up in the table."
1797940,1802340," Luckily, with looking up in the table, we don't really have to do that all the time."
1802340,1804500," We have to only do that once per syscall."
1804500,1805660," Right."
1805660,1809440," And after that, we can just reuse the same things over and over again."
1809440,1811660," So, am I looking at the right thing?"
1811660,1812940," I think I'm looking at the right thing."
1813080,1814520," So, just a second."
1814520,1815240," Yeah, 41."
1815240,1817700," So, this is going to be 41."
1817700,1821400," And in here, we're going to have RDI."
1821400,1823520," We're going to put a domain in here."
1823520,1824760," Then RSI."
1824760,1826880," We're going to have type in here."
1826880,1829580," And RDX is going to be protocol."
1829580,1832040," So, after that, we're going to perform a syscall."
1832040,1832720," Right."
1832720,1833800," We're going to perform a syscall."
1833800,1841160," So, and the question is what we have to put in the domain type and protocol."
1841160,1843180," I don't quite remember, to be fair."
1843180,1848800," So, can you make a macro for string creation?"
1848800,1850120," I believe I can."
1850120,1853180," I think there was even an example in the article that I linked."
1853880,1857600," There was an example that shows how to do this kind of stuff."
1857600,1858120," I think."
1858120,1860260," No, it's not actually there."
1860260,1862900," I think it's somewhere in the manual."
1862900,1864680," I think it's somewhere in the manual."
1865000,1876500," And by the way, I forgot to mention, all of that, everything I said about macros and stuff like that, all of that is applicable specifically to the FASM version 1."
1877040,1883480," They developed a FASM version 2, where they introduced a thing called Flat Assembler G."
1884600,1889740," So, essentially, they took that idea of being like a very powerful preprocessor to the next level."
1889740,1893840," So, they basically said, we are now architecture agnostic."
1893840,1897900," We do not target any specific, you know, CPU."
1897900,1899880," X86 ARM, we don't care."
1899880,1901700," It is up to you."
1901980,1905760," All of these architectures are now libraries that you plug in."
1905760,1907720," And this is like a sort of assembly engine."
1907720,1919240," And, yeah, so they have even more powerful macro system in here that allows you to even specify encoding for, you know, for instructions that this system never saw before."
1919240,1922620," So, you basically have architectures as libraries."
1922620,1924660," Right?"
1924660,1929180," So, and it's actually kind of interesting."
1929180,1932080," It would be interesting to explore all of that, but I never looked into that."
1932080,1933260," Right?"
1933260,1936400," So, it's something very sophisticated and very powerful, but, yeah."
1936400,1939060," Calm instruction pointer."
1939060,1939880," Holy shit."
1939880,1945340," So, and to be fair, this thing is a little bit under-documented."
1945340,1948140," So, there is a couple of, like, articles and stuff like that."
1948140,1956060," But a lot of explanation of how this entire thing works is done through discussions on their forum."
1956060,1956720," Right?"
1956720,1960740," So, basically, their forum is documentation to this thing."
1960740,1961860," Right?"
1961860,1963780," The manuals kind of help, but not kind of fully."
1963780,1966940," There's some also, like, YouTube channels and stuff like that."
1966940,1967820," So, I don't know."
1967820,1971040," But we're using the first version of FlightAssembler."
1971040,1977540," And, okay, so what I was saying is that there is an interesting version of a macro called struct."
1978300,1979160," I'm not really struct."
1979160,1980980," I think it's not struct."
1980980,1986520," Yeah, I think it was in struct."
1986520,1988280," I kind of forgot how it does."
1988280,1989760," So, you do that through a struct."
1989760,1990860," Yeah, there we go."
1990860,1992520," So, you can define a structure."
1992520,1993280," Right?"
1993400,1997940," And structure works kind of like a macro."
1997940,2006820," Except when you do .name, it basically generates a name of the name of the macro, .that thing."
2006820,2007460," Right?"
2007460,2010220," So, essentially, let me show you what I mean."
2010560,2012020," You can create a structure like this."
2012020,2012340," Right?"
2012340,2013660," And it's basically like a macro."
2013660,2015200," It is basically like a macro."
2015200,2020600," Meaning that if you do .69 for 20, it will just get expanded."
2020600,2021020," Right?"
2021020,2025840," It will just get expanded to x, w, x, and y, w, y."
2025840,2028620," But, 69 actually in 420."
2028620,2032140," But, it will also prefix dots with point."
2032140,2034920," So, that's basically what it does."
2034920,2038220," So, it, like, handles these dots in a special way."
2038600,2041660," But, apart from that, it's basically, it's basically macro."
2041660,2043780," And, one of the things you can do in here."
2043780,2044160," Right?"
2044160,2045800," So, you can do something like this."
2045800,2055080," So, essentially, if you have just . and space, it will replace it with the name that you provided in here."
2055080,2058800," So, essentially, you can just have special message macro."
2058800,2060540," Special message macro."
2060540,2065200," That automatically also defines message size."
2065200,2065680," Right?"
2065680,2068040," It defines the message itself and also message size."
2068540,2070900," But, I don't really want to go into that right away."
2070900,2073880," Because, I'm not 100% sure how exactly it's going to work."
2073880,2076140," And, it feels like it redefines existing DB."
2076140,2078960," So, I'm also not sure how that will work."
2078960,2079840," So, yeah."
2079840,2080740," I'm going to leave it as this."
2080740,2082900," But, I'm going to keep that at the back of my head."
2082900,2084060," Right?"
2084060,2085500," I'm going to keep that at the back of my head."
2085500,2087180," So, anyway."
2087180,2091900," So, we need to call to socket somehow."
2091900,2093200," We need to call to socket."
2093200,2095780," So, let me see how exactly we're going to do that."
2096080,2097640," So, one of the things I probably want to do."
2097640,2101420," I want to find, like, TCP server in C."
2101420,2102640," Right?"
2102640,2105100," I want to see some examples that I can steal."
2105100,2107820," Geeks for geeks."
2107820,2108180," Okay."
2108180,2113760," Geeks for geeks."
2114500,2116020," We can use that, I suppose."
2116020,2117360," Let's use geeks for geeks."
2117360,2118400," Okay."
2118400,2120600," So, we're supposed to put AFnet."
2120600,2127640," Which means that the protocol, the domain of the socket is the internet domain."
2127640,2131260," This is because the sockets can have different domains."
2131260,2132620," There is a Unix domain socket."
2132620,2133000," Right?"
2133000,2134700," So, they're, like, sort of local pipe."
2134880,2140260," And there's internet domain sockets, which are sockets to external resources on the internet."
2140260,2140640," Right?"
2140640,2144260," So, usually, like, majority of the resources are internet resources."
2144260,2147300," So, people don't really know much about Unix sockets."
2147300,2149960," But, locally, on Unix systems, they are still used."
2149960,2154860," I wonder if we can even find some interesting stuff in here."
2154860,2155420," Yeah, there we go."
2155480,2157280," So, here are different things in here."
2157280,2160640," So, internet, specifically IPv4."
2160640,2162780," So, you can also have IPv6."
2162780,2165860," So, Unix or local sockets."
2165860,2166640," It doesn't matter."
2166640,2168660," A little bit of that stuff that nobody uses."
2168660,2169980," Who uses IPX?"
2169980,2176300," I kind of vaguely remember IPX protocols, like, a long time ago."
2176300,2180740," But, even, like, 20 years ago, I think they were already kind of outdated."
2180740,2182240," So, yeah."
2182240,2184580," Nobody uses anything except, like, these things."
2184680,2186040," Like, everyone just uses that thing."
2186040,2187600," And, maybe, Unix sometimes, right?"
2187600,2188300," For local things."
2188300,2190840," People in 95."
2190840,2191220," Okay."
2191220,2192580," 1995."
2192580,2196060," But, yeah."
2196060,2198080," PostX API still supports all that."
2198080,2200500," PostX API still supports all that."
2200500,2201540," So, we'll need to have IFNET."
2201540,2204100," So, we don't have this constant yet."
2204100,2205580," So, we'll probably have to define it somehow."
2205580,2209340," So, then, we say that it's a streaming socket, right?"
2209340,2214360," So, a streaming socket within the internet domain means TCP."
2214360,2215360," TCP, right?"
2215360,2216600," It means TCP."
2216600,2221060," And then, yeah, the protocol is zero."
2221060,2225800," So, the idea is, so, this is sort of like a catalog, right?"
2225800,2231140," You're specifying the type of the protocol top-down, right?"
2231280,2237120," So, first, you specify the domain of the protocols, the huge domain of the protocols."
2237120,2244360," So, you have a lot of different domains, like Unix sockets, internet sockets, and, like, IPX and stuff like that."
2244360,2245380," You pick a domain."
2245500,2246600," Okay, so, internet domain."
2246600,2248080," We're talking about internet domain."
2248080,2251400," Within the internet domain, there are different classes of sockets, right?"
2251400,2252480," So, there is a SOC stream."
2252480,2263220," And because there is only one streaming socket within the internet domain, you can just put zero in here in the place of the protocol because it's going to be TCP."
2264500,2269160," Okay, there is only TCP in that specific sort of, like, type of the protocol."
2269160,2271380," So, that's why you just put zero."
2271380,2275260," So, that's how it works."
2275260,2277440," This is how, at least, I understand it, right?"
2277440,2281660," So, but if we try to compile this, and I think, I don't think it's going to work."
2281780,2282720," Yeah, so, there we go."
2282720,2285040," It says, undefine simple AF net."
2285040,2286860," I was trying to use this symbol in here."
2286860,2288500," So, that makes a little bit of sense."
2288500,2291260," We need to somehow define AF in net."
2291260,2293140," So, the question is, what is it equal to?"
2293140,2299800," We can try to find it in, you know, in a standard C library, or we can create a C program, right?"
2299800,2308680," So, if I take a look at the socket page in here, and just, like, copy paste this stuff."
2310000,2314900," So, maybe I also want to include stdio super quick."
2314900,2317340," So, I can output shy setting here."
2317340,2319240," There we go."
2319240,2324360," And just do printf."
2324360,2329140," I have in net, d, I have in net."
2329140,2336280," So, then we can do cco main, main.c, and we're going to instantly run this entire thing."
2336280,2337420," And it's equal to two."
2337420,2338520," Okay."
2339060,2340540," It's as simple as that."
2340540,2343180," As simple as that."
2343180,2348740," So, now, we can also take a look at what is sockStream."
2348740,2349580," SockStream."
2349580,2350300," Right."
2350300,2351480," So, what is it equal to?"
2351480,2355340," So, it is equal to one."
2355340,2360280," Just stealing code from C."
2360280,2362120," Just stealing code from C."
2362120,2362640," And there we go."
2362640,2363500," Starting web server."
2363500,2364740," Nothing really crashed."
2364920,2367000," But we don't even handle the error."
2367000,2369620," We don't even handle the error."
2369620,2374540," So, how can we know if this entire thing even succeeded?"
2374600,2377000," How can we know that socket actually succeeded?"
2377000,2379700," We can take a look at its return value."
2379700,2380280," Right."
2380280,2383040," If the return value is negative, that means it failed."
2383040,2386460," But where is return value located?"
2387820,2388820," We can do strace."
2388820,2389840," That's a good idea, actually."
2389840,2390600," We can do strace."
2390600,2391000," Why not?"
2391000,2392100," So, let's give it a try."
2392100,2393900," strace."
2393900,2396280," There we go."
2396280,2397140," It actually succeeded."
2397280,2398280," So, it returned three."
2398280,2399860," It returned three."
2399860,2402580," IP proto IP."
2402580,2404840," It recognized zero as that specific thing."
2404840,2406080," That's pretty cool."
2406080,2412120," And you know what's funny is that the executable that Fuzzin produces, they have almost no runtime."
2412120,2414900," Yeah, they have no runtime at all."
2414900,2419780," So, in strace, you're going to literally see only these six calls that you put in there."
2419780,2421160," So, you have three six calls."
2421160,2422440," Write, socket, and exit."
2422440,2424380," And this is literally what you did in here."
2424380,2425840," Write, socket, and exit."
2427280,2430700," Because there is no runtime."
2430700,2432400," There is no libc or anything like that."
2432400,2438840," Usually, if you just make a hello world in C, it will call a shit ton of different syscalls."
2438840,2444820," Like, okay, we can take a look at this thing that just outputs two lines."
2444820,2445800," Right."
2445800,2449160," We can take a look at what strace of this thing looks like."
2449160,2453000," So, that's its strace."
2455260,2463940," So, the runtime just, you know, links with, like, opens dynamic libraries, allocates some memory and stuff like that, probably for the malloc."
2463940,2466140," And only then it performs two writes."
2466140,2469380," That's how much additional runtime you have in here."
2469380,2473320," But, I mean, the computers, modern computers are pretty powerful, so they can handle that."
2473380,2475740," This is not the worst thing that they can handle."
2475740,2476440," Right."
2476440,2483020," But, it's just like, when you just call this thing, it's like, literally, all the syscalls."
2483020,2485220," There's additional syscalls in here, execve."
2485220,2489980," But, I suppose, it is coming from the program that executed websites."
2489980,2490680," Right."
2491100,2501980," Yeah, because, essentially, how you start a child process, how you start a child process, you fork your process, and within the child process, you perform execve."
2501980,2505120," So, it is the child who must perform exec."
2505120,2509780," So, that's why we can see execve in strace."
2509780,2521580," Because it was basically injected into our child process for us, and then execve replaced the current image with the image of the website, and already the website performed these three syscalls."
2521580,2522060," Right."
2522060,2522780," That makes sense."
2524360,2526180," I think that, in fact, makes sense."
2526180,2529420," Pretty cool, isn't it?"
2529420,2530240," Pretty cool."
2530240,2536860," We can try to debug this thing as well, like, step debug, and see how it modifies the registers and stuff like that."
2536860,2538940," So, that will be interesting."
2538940,2546580," So, the problem here is that FASM does not create, you know, debug information."
2546580,2549900," I think there is no way to ask FASM to create debug information."
2549900,2553880," So, we have to do a little bit of a hackish thing."
2554200,2555580," So, let me show."
2555580,2556680," So, I'm going to go in here."
2556680,2559880," So, if I just do gdb website."
2559880,2561460," Yeah."
2561460,2563920," So, no debugging symbols found in website."
2563920,2566600," Furthermore, you can't even break on main."
2566600,2567560," There is no main."
2567560,2569660," Main doesn't exist."
2569660,2571500," You can't break on start."
2571500,2572680," Start doesn't exist."
2572680,2575240," There is no thing like that."
2575240,2576860," So, this as main."
2576860,2578340," You can't do that."
2578340,2583100," You can't do that."
2583220,2586700," There is literally zero symbols in here."
2586700,2589360," There is literally zero symbols in here."
2589360,2593340," So, people say that it has g."
2593340,2594160," Okay."
2594160,2595040," Let's actually see."
2595040,2596600," So, I can probably..."
2596600,2599400," People in the chat are probably confabulating shit."
2599400,2600860," I don't really believe that it has g."
2600860,2602580," But maybe it's true."
2602580,2604540," So, let's actually give them benefit of the doubt."
2604760,2606040," And there is no g in here."
2606040,2618180," So, the reason why you thought it has minus g is because you probably saw that in other compilers."
2618180,2618460," Right?"
2618460,2619540," You saw that in GCC."
2619540,2620680," You saw that in NASM."
2620680,2623040," You probably, like, saw that in some other place."
2623040,2624420," And you sort of extrapolated."
2624420,2628400," You sort of extrapolated and thought that maybe it also has this thing."
2628400,2631740," And this is basically an example of how GPT confabulate things."
2631740,2632560," Right?"
2632560,2635440," So, GPT literally mimics people."
2635440,2639800," Oh, there is a dump symbolic information for debugging."
2639800,2640680," That's actually pretty cool."
2640680,2642000," So, let's actually go ahead and do that."
2642980,2644680," So, do we have to do it like this?"
2644680,2647700," I think options have to go in here."
2647700,2651860," I don't really know how it works, though."
2651860,2654600," So, output."
2654600,2657340," Optional settings."
2657340,2658720," Okay."
2658720,2661460," So, web site.txt."
2661460,2662960," All right."
2662960,2664040," Source file not found."
2664040,2672380," So, maybe I have to put it as web site.txt."
2672660,2674240," So, oh, it's awesome."
2674240,2674700," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2674700,2675660," Finally."
2675660,2676300," Oh, my God."
2676300,2676860," Okay."
2676860,2677860," So, there is a txt."
2677860,2679560," But it's probably not txt."
2679560,2679920," Right?"
2679920,2681260," So, it's probably..."
2681260,2683040," I didn't know what the fuck is that, honestly."
2683040,2688920," So, I can try to take a look at web or file."
2688920,2691720," And it's just data."
2691720,2692700," So, you're supposed to..."
2692700,2694980," It's like we don't really know what the fuck it is."
2694980,2696840," So, what if I do gdb?"
2696840,2700040," So, file format not recognized."
2700040,2702340," It just, like, uses some custom file format."
2702340,2703580," I don't fucking know what it is."
2703580,2704820," Right?"
2704820,2706060," So, yeah."
2706060,2707920," It's kind of difficult to debug this kind of stuff."
2707920,2708220," Right?"
2708220,2711440," And people keep in the chat configurating different things."
2711440,2713460," But there is one way you can debug that."
2713460,2715800," The one way you can debug that."
2716500,2721140," In ELF format, there's a very interesting thing."
2721140,2723980," It is called the entry point address."
2723980,2726840," It is called entry point address."
2726840,2730580," So, what you can do."
2730580,2736340," You can break on that specific address that you found in the ELF file."
2736980,2738900," And then you can run this entire thing."
2738900,2740940," But you're not going to see anything."
2740940,2742020," You're not going to see anything."
2742020,2744280," So, you need to, like, to enable."
2744280,2747080," And you need to set a layout to assembly."
2747080,2747640," And there you go."
2747640,2749780," So, here are all of your syscalls."
2749780,2751860," But you see the pure assembly."
2751860,2752380," Right?"
2752440,2753740," So, you see the row assembly."
2753740,2756880," But you can see the syscalls in here."
2756880,2758760," You can literally see the syscalls in here."
2758760,2762040," So, yeah."
2762040,2765360," So, apparently, Fuzzin comes with its own kind of thing."
2765360,2769360," But it's kind of difficult to figure out, like, right off the bat, how to use that."
2769360,2771100," So, I'm probably not going to use that."
2771100,2773320," So, this is the trick that kind of works."
2773320,2775000," So, maybe I'm going to work with that trick."
2775000,2778900," We can actually use a better, you know, debugger."
2778900,2779140," Right?"
2779140,2781880," Why do we have to use GDB if we can use something like GF?"
2782740,2783020," Right."
2783020,2783960," So, I'm going to do GF."
2783960,2785720," And I'm going to do website."
2785720,2787320," So, let me see."
2787320,2788600," So, maybe I'm going to do it like that."
2788600,2792760," And we're going to break specifically on that thing."
2792760,2797200," So, can I find the entry point?"
2797200,2799800," So, I probably can just, you know, highlight."
2799800,2800820," Can I put it in here?"
2800820,2803640," No, I can't put it in here because GF doesn't really support that."
2803640,2806000," It doesn't support inserting it like that."
2806000,2806320," There we go."
2806320,2809020," So, maybe this is something that I have to contribute in there."
2809020,2809380," Right?"
2809380,2810680," So, I can run it now."
2810680,2812100," And there we go."
2813020,2820240," So, and the cool thing that you can have in here is that you can quite conveniently see the registers, especially if you step."
2820240,2820840," Right?"
2820840,2824200," So, as you can see, I'm setting up different registers."
2824200,2825620," Right?"
2825740,2827320," And then, I perform the syscalls."
2827320,2830880," And as you can see, after performing the syscalls, I have a starting web server."
2830880,2831760," Right?"
2831760,2836000," And after that syscalls, we have a couple of things modified in here."
2836580,2839420," So, and you can see that rex became 21."
2839420,2841360," Right?"
2841360,2847680," So, essentially, writes this call returns the result in rex."
2847680,2849400," It returns the result in rex."
2849480,2855240," And it usually returns the amount of characters that were written into the standard output, into the file specifically."
2855240,2856680," The standard output is just a file."
2857280,2862660," So, and if we take a look at how many characters we have in here, here we have 20 characters specifically."
2862660,2863020," Right?"
2863020,2865980," 20 characters specifically plus the new line 10."
2865980,2866700," Right?"
2866760,2869360," And this is exactly what we see in rex, 21 characters."
2869360,2873220," So, the Linux kernel told us that I wrote 21 characters."
2873220,2875980," So, we can literally see all of that, which is pretty kind of weird."
2875980,2877060," Right?"
2877060,2879340," So, the next syscall is supposed to be what?"
2879340,2880420," I forgot."
2880420,2881940," I think it's a socket."
2881940,2882320," All right."
2882320,2883720," So, let's actually set up the socket."
2883720,2885980," Boom, boom, boom."
2885980,2888580," And we are about to perform."
2888580,2891460," Is it really correct, actually?"
2891460,2894200," So, I have a net two."
2894200,2895680," It doesn't really feel correct."
2896760,2902440," Because there is four things in here."
2902440,2905020," Oh, syssocket."
2905020,2905420," Yeah."
2905420,2907980," So, syssocket is 41, which is actually, yeah."
2907980,2908880," So, everything is correct."
2908880,2911480," So, what's going to happen after the socket?"
2911480,2915580," So, the result located in rex is three."
2915580,2920720," Which is a really plausible number for a socket."
2920720,2921160," Right?"
2921160,2924360," So, because basically by creating a socket, we created a new file."
2924360,2925620," We opened a new file."
2925880,2928060," We already have three files opened."
2928060,2931520," With id zero, standard output."
2931520,2932460," Standard input."
2932460,2934700," With id one, standard output."
2934700,2936740," And with id two, standard error."
2936740,2941680," So, if we open another file, so the id is going to be the next one after that, which is three."
2941680,2942480," Right?"
2942480,2943340," And that's what we get."
2943340,2947960," So, we have the id of the socket, the file descriptor of the socket, in rex."
2949260,2953020," And essentially, like, we don't really do anything with that thing."
2953020,2953900," Right?"
2953900,2957620," So, we just populate the arguments for the exit syscall and we just exit."
2957620,2959060," We just take it."
2959060,2962880," So, I suppose what we have to do, we have to save that socket id somewhere."
2962880,2963640," Right?"
2964520,2965980," We need to save that socket id."
2965980,2968940," So, let me see."
2968940,2970940," So, let's create something like SOC of D."
2970940,2975060," How much memory should we allocate for storing the socket id?"
2975060,2976820," How much memory should we allocate?"
2977200,2979920," So, maybe four bytes is going to be enough."
2979920,2986020," So, I know that the, you know, directive db is byte."
2986020,2986420," Right?"
2986420,2989100," So, this is one byte."
2989100,2992300," Word is two bytes."
2992300,2993620," So, it's w."
2993620,2995200," dw is two bytes."
2995200,2998400," So, four bytes is double word."
2998400,2999620," Double word."
2999620,3000840," Because of that, it's dd."
3000840,3002400," So, this is going to be four bytes."
3002400,3005540," And eight bytes, it's quad word."
3005540,3006120," Right?"
3006120,3007040," So, dq."
3007820,3010640," So, this is sort of like a cheat sheet that I want to keep in here just to remember."
3010640,3012120," Because I can never remember that."
3012120,3015500," So, I can only remember that by sort of like doing this mnemonic."
3015500,3015740," Right?"
3015740,3018700," I know that byte is one and word is two."
3018700,3023900," So, that means four bytes is double words and quad word is eight bytes."
3023900,3026580," So, we can just do dd."
3026580,3027380," Right?"
3027380,3030340," And you're supposed to put the value of this thing in here."
3030340,3031600," So, I'm going to put zero in here."
3031600,3032360," There we go."
3032360,3035800," So, and essentially, what we can do."
3035960,3040100," After we call the socket, we know that in racks, we have the file descriptor."
3040100,3044220," We can just move the file descriptor into here."
3044220,3044720," Right?"
3044720,3045460," From racks."
3045460,3047120," But we have to be a little bit careful."
3047120,3047400," Right?"
3047400,3048860," Because it's 32 bits."
3048860,3050180," Racks is 64 bits."
3050180,3052400," So, maybe we want to do EAX."
3052400,3053400," Right?"
3053400,3061420," And as far as I know, phasm also supports the syntax where you can literally say dworked, indicating that do the 32-bit write."
3061420,3070240," So, because if I accidentally do something like this, I think it's going to go over this entire thing and it will try to override this message."
3070240,3070480," Right?"
3070540,3072760," So, basically, it's going to be buffer overflow."
3072760,3074780," Right?"
3074780,3076300," It's going to be buffer overflow."
3076300,3078340," So, we have to be careful with this kind of thing."
3078340,3079600," So, it has to be dworked."
3079600,3084520," And if I remember correctly, if you do it like that, phasm is not going to even warn you about that."
3085820,3087000," Oh, it warns."
3087000,3087880," Operate size doesn't matter."
3087880,3088220," Okay."
3088220,3089540," Okay."
3089540,3094480," So, it actually warns you if, like, some write sizes and read sizes do not match."
3094480,3095320," It's actually pretty cool."
3095320,3097980," So, I have to do dworked instead and it works."
3097980,3098260," Right?"
3098260,3098800," It works."
3098800,3099700," And we'll save it there."
3099700,3103460," We can now check if it actually worked out."
3103460,3106620," So, let me see how to do that."
3106620,3109220," So, yep."
3109220,3112400," I'm going to try to refresh this entire stuff."
3112400,3115300," And, unfortunately, that kind of killed the breakpoint."
3115520,3118460," Let me see if the breakpoint is still there."
3118460,3120320," So, I'm going to do read f, e."
3120320,3121960," Right?"
3121960,3124780," So, entry point is this specific thing."
3124780,3127000," So, I'm going to break on that specific point."
3127000,3129140," And I'm going to just run this entire thing."
3129140,3129520," And there we go."
3129520,3130060," We're there."
3130060,3133480," So, yes, yes, yes, yes."
3133480,3137680," So, here is the move, by the way, I think."
3137680,3140180," No, it's somewhere down below."
3140180,3142860," Did I do that correctly?"
3142860,3145880," Wait, I cannot find this instruction."
3145880,3148360," I can't really find this instruction."
3148360,3149560," So, here is the write."
3149560,3149840," Okay."
3149840,3155660," Oh, I think it didn't update the executable."
3155660,3159540," It uses the old executable because there is this socket syscall."
3159800,3162260," And then, instantly, the exit syscall."
3162260,3165440," I think I need to actually refresh everything."
3165440,3166620," So, I'm going to try to recompile."
3166620,3170980," And I'm going to just do this thing one more time."
3170980,3175140," So, gf, gf2, website, like this."
3175140,3177400," Do I have break?"
3178220,3185080," So, I wonder if there is some sort of a way to save that specific entry point."
3185080,3190260," But I feel like it may change if something changes within the executable."
3190260,3190600," Right."
3190600,3193440," So, maybe some things get upset or something."
3193440,3195020," So, I'm not really sure."
3195020,3196220," There we go."
3196220,3197140," So, here is the write."
3197140,3198500," You know what's cool in here?"
3198500,3199140," Right."
3199180,3201400," It uses a relative address."
3201400,3201840," Right."
3201840,3205960," It's relative to the current instruction pointer."
3205960,3206300," Right."
3206300,3208160," So, basically, here is the current instruction pointer."
3208160,3209340," Here is the current instruction."
3209340,3211560," And it's plus this specific value."
3211560,3213380," But JDB has a very cool feature."
3213380,3215280," It gives you the absolute address."
3215280,3218180," It gives you the actual absolute address."
3218180,3220340," Right."
3220340,3222280," And we can use that as a pointer."
3222280,3225560," So, we can literally say 4102."
3225560,3228660," And I can say, okay, let's cast that to the pointer."
3228940,3229620," Integer."
3229620,3231120," You can do that."
3231120,3231340," Right."
3231340,3231780," In GDB."
3231780,3233600," So, this feature comes from GDB."
3233600,3235640," And then we can dereference this thing."
3235640,3237720," And it shows us the value of this thing."
3237720,3241980," We initialize that variable with 0 in here."
3241980,3242620," Right."
3242620,3244340," So, it's with 0."
3244340,3246620," And as you can see, it is 0 in here as well."
3246620,3248580," So, that's pretty cool."
3248580,3251240," So, let's actually do a step debugger."
3251240,3252500," So, here is the write."
3252500,3254300," So, we wrote start in web server."
3254300,3256840," And then we are creating socket."
3256840,3257140," Right."
3257140,3258600," So, if we take a look at the registers."
3259360,3263780," We'll see that in here, in the register, in the result, we have three."
3263780,3267640," So, and we are about to write that three into the memory."
3267640,3271760," Into that little section of memory that we allocated specifically for storing the socket."
3271760,3272740," And there you go."
3272740,3273800," It actually wrote it there."
3274800,3282000," So, if you know the specific address of your variable and you know the type of the variable, you can just use this kind of trick."
3282000,3284120," And you can literally see it in the debugger."
3285080,3290020," So, without any debug information, I can already explore different variables and stuff like that."
3290160,3290660," So, it's pretty cool."
3290660,3296400," So, I stored the ID in the memory."
3296400,3297860," I stored the ID in the memory."
3297860,3303000," So, people are asking what is the GDB frontend."
3303000,3304600," It's actually called GF."
3304820,3307860," So, let me give you the link to this frontend."
3307860,3309980," So, you can find it in here."
3309980,3313860," And for anyone on YouTube, I'm going to actually put that in the description."
3313860,3315460," There we go."
3315460,3317120," It's going to be in the description."
3317120,3319020," Okay, cool."
3319020,3322840," The problem is that creating a socket may fail."
3322840,3324820," Creating a socket may fail."
3326200,3329800," We need to check that it is, you know, it is correct."
3329800,3332040," We can try to make it fail, right?"
3332040,3337520," We can try to make it fail by doing something like this, right?"
3337520,3339660," So, I can provide 69 for 20."
3339660,3343500," And I suppose that will basically crash, right?"
3343500,3345460," So, Iraq's is going to be naked, right?"
3345460,3348140," Because this is probably not the correct combination of the arguments."
3348140,3350920," This is probably not the correct combination of the arguments."
3350920,3352480," So, let's actually try to do FASM."
3352480,3354540," So, write fail."
3354540,3357200," This is because this thing is currently executing."
3357200,3358880," So, let's actually kill it, right?"
3358880,3360940," So, then I'm going to try to recompile one more time."
3360940,3362600," And I'm going to refresh it."
3362600,3368140," And I'm going to try to break on this thing one more time."
3368140,3369220," And let's just run it."
3369220,3371320," Yeah, there we go."
3371320,3372940," So, let's go ahead."
3372940,3375620," Let's take a look at the registers."
3375620,3379920," It's still using the old..."
3379920,3381680," Yeah, it doesn't refresh."
3381680,3383160," I remember if I press..."
3383160,3384240," Yeah, it will restart your DB."
3384540,3385880," But it doesn't reload."
3385880,3389120," Toggle disassembly."
3389120,3391860," So, we can only restart."
3391860,3395800," But it restarts it with sort of like the same thing, unfortunately."
3395800,3401380," And the problem is that I don't like that I have to provide this executable one more time."
3401380,3403040," But let's try to do that."
3403040,3406480," Maybe this time it's going to be a little bit easier."
3409040,3409580," All right."
3409580,3411640," Yeah, let's go."
3411640,3414140," So, here's the first syscall."
3414140,3416880," And here comes the second syscall."
3416880,3417420," Right."
3417420,3419220," So, the socket syscall."
3420100,3423020," And let's take a look at the racks in here."
3423020,3424260," Racks should become..."
3424260,3424760," Yeah, there we go."
3424760,3425940," So, that's the negative racks."
3425940,3427540," We just provided bullshit in there."
3427540,3429200," And we got a negative failure."
3429200,3430500," Right."
3430500,3431920," So, we got a negative failure."
3432680,3436580," So, I suppose what we have to do, we have to check for a negative failure."
3436580,3447300," So, the way we can do that, the way we can do that, we can do probably, right, after we did the socket, we can do cmp racks zero."
3447300,3448300," All right."
3448940,3454880," And, for example, if it's less than zero, we have to jump somewhere."
3454880,3456080," Right."
3456080,3457260," We have to jump somewhere."
3457260,3459340," For instance, we can jump to error."
3459340,3463700," And in error, we can have a separate thing in here."
3463700,3465520," So, error is sort of like a separate section."
3465520,3467100," Right."
3467220,3469860," And here, we're going to maybe print an error message."
3469860,3476880," So, maybe we're going to do, you know, error mcg, error mcg len."
3476880,3486220," And then, we can say, so, let's rename start with error mcg, boom."
3486220,3491700," Error, like this."
3491700,3493760," There we go."
3494380,3498220," So, and after that, we probably want to exit with non-zero exit code, with one."
3498220,3501880," To be fair, maybe we want to even write it into the standard error."
3501880,3502700," Right."
3502700,3514580," So, and to not actually work with magical numbers, one of the things we can do, we can just define things like standard output, which is one, and standard error, which is two."
3514580,3516320," So, we can define these kind of things."
3516320,3522620," And every time we write something, right, so here I'm writing into the standard output, right, so this is a standard output."
3523100,3524920," And here, this is the standard error."
3524920,3526760," I'm programming in C."
3526760,3530920," Like, I'm literally programming in C."
3530920,3534740," So, in case of an error, write error message and exit with one."
3534740,3538080," I don't freaking know."
3538080,3539380," I don't freaking know."
3539380,3541360," So, all right."
3541360,3543860," So, if I do something like, yeah, let's actually repeat that."
3544100,3549520," But now, instead of just compiling it, let's also run it and see if it will say error."
3549520,3550040," There we go."
3550040,3552000," Starting web server, error."
3552000,3556000," So, that's pretty cool."
3556520,3561440," If we get back to, like, the correct arguments, it actually started."
3561440,3562700," It actually started."
3562700,3568280," So, that's pretty apogers."
3568280,3572540," So, people are also suggesting to do something like exit success and exit failure."
3572540,3573220," We can do that."
3573220,3573700," Why not?"
3574040,3582320," So, just to make it even more POSIX compliant, exit success, zero, exit failure, one."
3582320,3589000," So, as far as I know, using equals means that this is like a compile time variable."
3589500,3591720," So, that means at compile time, it can change."
3591720,3594120," But this is not particularly true for these kind of things."
3594120,3595820," They are more constants."
3595820,3603160," If I remember correctly, in FOSM, you use EQ instead of equals to indicate that this is a constant."
3603160,3604560," And that way, they cannot be changed."
3604560,3607940," The same kind of goes in here as well."
3607940,3608760," We just do EQ."
3608760,3611780," And this is a compile time constant specifically."
3611780,3616400," Compile time constant specifically."
3616620,3620580," And I really like how, like, easy it is to check for an error, right?"
3620580,3622860," So, it's just, like, two instructions, like, compare it to zero."
3622860,3626340," And just, like, bail out to the error section."
3626340,3627860," And there you go."
3627860,3632300," And if everything is successful, you just save this socket file descriptor."
3632300,3634460," You just save this socket file descriptor."
3634460,3636980," And now, you can work with this specific socket file descriptor."
3636980,3640160," So, that's pretty cool, I think."
3640160,3643440," But the problem here is that it's not particularly clear"
3643440,3647240," what's the cause of an error."
3647240,3648780," What's the cause of an error?"
3648780,3654280," One of the things we can do, we can, basically, before performing any of the operations,"
3654280,3659640," like socket, bind, listen, accept, we can just log what we're currently doing."
3659640,3661460," We can just log what we're currently doing."
3662080,3672840," We can do something like, write std out socket trace message."
3672840,3675620," That's pretty long, but maybe it's fine."
3675620,3678540," Write socket trace message."
3680020,3692200," And essentially, instead of start, socket trace message, creating a socket, right?"
3692200,3693180," Creating a socket."
3693180,3698880," So, socket trace message, socket trace message, that, blah, blah, blah."
3698880,3699300," There we go."
3699300,3702920," And if I try to run this entire thing, start len."
3704140,3705920," There is no start len."
3705920,3706740," Ready?"
3706740,3709180," Undefined symbol."
3709180,3711940," So, it is in 45."
3711940,3716160," It says there is no start len, but this is not true."
3716160,3717760," Huh."
3717760,3722440," Is that because I have to use, I still have to use equals in here, apparently."
3722440,3724740," Specifically here."
3724740,3726560," So, all right."
3726560,3728000," Okay."
3728820,3730560," So, creating socket."
3730560,3737660," But if I go back and fabricate an error, 69, 420."
3737660,3740000," Yeah."
3740000,3743780," So, we know at which point the error sort of occurred."
3743780,3746120," So, we kind of roughly know where it occurs."
3746120,3751040," So, starting web server, creating socket, creating a socket, and an error."
3751040,3756740," So, maybe if there was no error, we want to say something like, okay."
3756740,3758200," So, okay message."
3758820,3760660," Okay."
3760660,3761700," I'm so, Jillian."
3761700,3762740," All right."
3762740,3763720," So, there is a start."
3763720,3768400," And then we're going to clear place start with okay."
3768400,3769020," Boom."
3769020,3770620," Okaying web server."
3770620,3772480," Okay."
3772480,3773900," All right."
3773900,3774960," So, that way."
3774960,3778040," So, okay message."
3778040,3780600," I didn't see it because I was supposed to call it like this."
3780600,3782340," Uh-huh."
3782340,3783820," Let's go."
3783820,3786600," So, undefined symbol."
3786780,3787280," Okay."
3787280,3789280," So, because it's an okay message."
3789280,3791540," Boom."
3791540,3792220," So, yeah."
3792220,3792820," Error."
3792820,3799380," But if we go back and get rid of an error, get rid of an error, just create a socket, it says okay."
3799620,3803500," So, now we are able to trace each individual sort of action."
3804100,3808660," And if an error happens on each, on some sort of action, we know where roughly it happened."
3808660,3810080," So, it will help us a little bit."
3810080,3811620," Hopefully."
3811620,3813720," Hopefully, it will help us a little bit."
3815560,3823900," So, yes, we can even like maybe prefix all of these things within four to make it look like a legit logging, right?"
3823900,3831800," Because all of the logging frameworks, they have these sort of like levels of logging, like info, warning, and error."
3832000,3836620," And you feel like very enterprise, you feel very legitimate, very serious."
3836620,3837360," There we go."
3837360,3839840," We have different diagnostics at different levels."
3839840,3845600," We can actually tweak the level and only focus on very specific problems and not waste time on other problems."
3845720,3849760," You feel really good about yourself when you're using a logging system like that, don't you?"
3849760,3851420," I think you do."
3851420,3856080," So, that's literally the only reason why people have that."
3856080,3857840," So, and there we go."
3857840,3859640," Look how fucking cool it looks."
3859640,3864580," You just put a simple prefix in four and it already looks legitimate."
3864580,3866220," It looks like a serious program."
3866220,3868220," Can you believe this shit is written in assembly?"
3868220,3874160," It must have been written in some sort of like a latest trendy JavaScript framework."
3874700,3879680," Like, holy fucking shit, look at this level of logging, like level of tracing."
3879680,3881400," What the fuck?"
3881400,3883560," Is this written in assembly?"
3883560,3889120," That very scary, difficult language that I saw in the memes on Reddit?"
3889120,3890980," How is that even possible?"
3890980,3893360," The memes told me that it's impossible to program in this language."
3893360,3893960," Holy fuck."
3893960,3895180," What the fuck?"
3895180,3895940," You must be insane."
3895940,3904160," Anyways."
3904640,3911240," Imagine learning about technology through memes and really believing everything they say."
3911240,3912060," Holy shit."
3912060,3913900," And there's a lot of people like that."
3913900,3915280," Anyway."
3915280,3922280," So, we created the socket."
3922280,3923260," We created the socket."
3923260,3929040," The next step after creating a socket is to bind the socket."
3929040,3930520," And that is a little bit scary."
3930520,3931220," Not gonna lie."
3931220,3932300," That is a little bit scary."
3933020,3939240," So, because if you want to bind the socket, you have to fill up a structure."
3941280,3949920," You need to know the amount of fields of the structure."
3949920,3952380," You need to know the size of the fields of the structure."
3952380,3953880," So, you know their offsets."
3954920,3964380," And then you have to allocate enough memory for the structure and you need to actually apply the offsets precisely so you can write things correctly into it."
3964380,3967880," And only then you will be able to pass a pointer to the function."
3967880,3973860," And this is something that we'll have to do in assembly."
3976020,3976440," No."
3976440,3979820," That's the scary shit all of the Reddit memes were warning you about."
3979820,3980580," Oh, my God."
3980580,3981460," Oh, my God."
3981460,3982520," Let's go back to JavaScript."
3982520,3985360," Anyway."
3985360,3988400," So, we're already streaming for one hour."
3989360,3990960," And I think I want to make a small break."
3990960,3993280," I need to refill my tea."
3993280,4003200," So, and after that, we're going to go ahead and try to tackle that impossible computer science problem of allocating a structure in the memory and actually filling it up."
4004000,4011920," It's fucking impossible with some sort of a programming language that a lot of smart computer scientists spend years on implementing."
4011920,4013380," It is literally impossible."
4013380,4015580," An impossible computer science problem."
4015580,4018840," Only Microsoft can solve that with C Sharp."
4018840,4023360," You can only do that in C Sharp and not in any other language."
4023360,4024660," It is impossible."
4024660,4025880," But we're going to tackle that."
4025880,4027400," That is not going to stop us."
4027400,4029780," The only thing we need is a cup of tea."
4029780,4030240," So, yeah."
4030240,4030840," Let's make a small break."
4030840,4032080," All right."
4032520,4034120," I'm back with my tea."
4034120,4035600," My tea tea."
4035600,4040600," I mean, I was trying to say my tea."
4040600,4042840," Not what you thought."
4042840,4043220," Okay."
4043220,4048120," So, and what we need to do."
4048120,4051240," We need to allocate a little bit of a memory for the structure."
4051240,4056680," So, first of all, we need to understand what kind of structure we have to allocate."
4056680,4057000," Right."
4057000,4058620," So, if we take a look at the definition of bind."
4058620,4061280," So, we have a structure SokAddur."
4062000,4065300," We can try to find the definition of the structure."
4065300,4071360," I don't really want to search for the definition of the structure in my local source code."
4071360,4073360," Because it's kind of difficult to find anything in there."
4073360,4075280," Because it's like a glipc."
4075280,4077360," You know what we're going to do?"
4077360,4078400," I have an idea."
4078400,4081360," What if we just like download something like Musil?"
4081360,4082700," Right."
4083160,4086960," And we're going to grab Musil for implementations and stuff like that."
4086960,4088740," Right."
4088740,4091780," So, some other people may say, but that's cheating."
4091780,4093220," To that, I can only answer."
4093220,4094380," I cheated with your mom."
4094380,4097480," I can do whatever I want."
4097480,4101180," It's still going to be a website written in assembly."
4101180,4103700," It's still going to be a website written in assembly."
4103800,4104060," All right."
4104060,4108080," So, I'm going to be using that as a reference."
4108080,4108960," I'm an artist."
4108960,4110740," I'm a performance artist."
4110740,4111480," Right."
4111480,4113280," And this is my reference."
4113280,4119340," You know how the artists look up pictures on the internet for reference and stuff like that?"
4119340,4120340," That's the same thing."
4120340,4121760," That's the same thing."
4121760,4122540," It's a reference."
4122880,4129760," So, let's try to find the definition of this specific structure."
4129760,4130140," Right."
4130140,4131380," So, if we take a look at the bind."
4131380,4136980," It's probably defined with open curly brace."
4136980,4137300," Right."
4137300,4138540," So, we can do something like this."
4138540,4139560," It can be like that."
4139560,4140260," Boom."
4140260,4141820," Here is the definition."
4141820,4144480," This is the art of graphing."
4144480,4146700," The art of graphing."
4146700,4152260," So, knowing what exactly to grab to find precise place where the shed is located without any"
4152260,4157580," IntelliSense IDE or anything like that."
4157580,4160880," You just like craft a specific combination of characters and boom."
4160880,4161580," You found it."
4161580,4163340," And it's language agnostic."
4163340,4164920," It is language agnostic."
4164920,4168560," If you know how your language works, you can do that with a simple grap."
4168560,4169400," And there you go."
4169400,4170680," You find the definition."
4170680,4172260," It's that freaking simple."
4172260,4175860," And it's going to work five years after today."
4175860,4177580," Ten years after today."
4177580,4181940," Will your favorite IDE survive after ten years?"
4182140,4185900," Will you be able to still use Visual Studio Code in ten years?"
4185900,4187420," Will it still be there?"
4187420,4190720," Or maybe Microsoft will go bankrupt and this entire thing is going to die?"
4190720,4192760," We don't freaking know."
4192760,4197760," But even grap does not survive in ten years."
4197760,4204720," There will be some other tool that accepts a string and just searches for the substring in the file system."
4204840,4210340," And that approach is going to work in ten years, in 20 years, in 50 years."
4213660,4222400," Anyway, that's basically the structure."
4222400,4224820," And that's a very interesting structure."
4224820,4226980," So that's a very interesting structure."
4226980,4230160," It has SAFamily and SADATA."
4230160,4232580," SAFamily and SADATA."
4233700,4239880," But if we take a look at the example from the very reputable website called Geeks4Geeks."
4239880,4242260," Very reputable website."
4242260,4246100," They actually have three fields in here."
4246100,4248520," Which is like, what the fuck is going on in here?"
4249900,4252320," So what's the definition of server ADDR?"
4252320,4257560," The definition is actually SOC address underscore in."
4257560,4260500," Wait a freaking second."
4260500,4263740," If we take a look at the definition of the bind,"
4263740,4267000," it's ADDR without in."
4267940,4270360," But here we do IN."
4270360,4273020," What the fuck is going on?"
4273020,4276520," What the fuck is going on?"
4276520,4280380," We can try to find the definition of such thing."
4280380,4282660," Of course, we can just put IN in there."
4282660,4285140," And it's completely different."
4285140,4285920," There you go."
4286520,4290260," So it has SINFamily, SINPORT, SINADDRESS and SIN0"
4290260,4294340," to, I suppose, pad that specific thing"
4294340,4297980," to the size of SOC address without underscore."
4297980,4300880," And they also, furthermore,"
4300880,4302480," when they're passing this point,"
4302480,4305940," they're actually casting that to a very specific thing."
4305940,4309000," So we are using a different structure"
4309000,4312060," than the one that bind expects."
4313300,4316720," And this is because this is a form of polymorphism."
4316720,4319840," So essentially, you can create sockets"
4319840,4321160," of different domains,"
4321160,4323840," different domains like internet domain,"
4323840,4325920," Unix domain and stuff like that."
4325920,4327980," And bind is supposed to work"
4327980,4331080," with all the sockets regardless of domain."
4331080,4332240," Right."
4332240,4335300," And different domains may have"
4335300,4336720," different sort of parameters."
4336720,4340100," So underscore IN indicates that we are operating"
4340100,4342220," within the internet domain,"
4342960,4343860," within the internet domain."
4343860,4345400," And these are the parameters"
4345400,4346920," of the internet domain."
4346920,4349100," So as far as I know,"
4349100,4351020," there is also UN, I think."
4351020,4351960," I think the UN."
4351960,4354960," So there is a similar SOC ADDR,"
4354960,4356960," SOC ADDR,"
4356960,4359100," but with UN."
4359100,4360640," And this is for Unix domain."
4360640,4363340," Maybe it's actually located somewhere here."
4363340,4364040," Yeah, there we go."
4364040,4364980," So."
4364980,4368840," And to be fair,"
4368840,4371420," I think they have different sizes, actually."
4372580,4373760," they actually have different sizes."
4373760,4376020," So I thought that maybe"
4376020,4379440," zero was added to pad"
4379440,4380580," to a specific size,"
4380580,4381740," but it's not necessarily true"
4381740,4382620," because for UNIX domain,"
4382620,4383640," it's actually huge."
4383640,4386060," Look at the size of this specific socket."
4386060,4388180," Look at the size of this specific socket."
4388180,4390200," And I think this is intentional."
4390200,4390880," Right."
4390880,4392640," If we take a look at what's going on here,"
4392640,4394680," bind also accepts"
4394680,4396680," the size of the structure"
4396680,4397540," that you're passing."
4398540,4399600," it also accepts"
4399600,4400500," the size of the structure"
4400500,4401680," that you're passing."
4401680,4403120," It distinguishes"
4403120,4405080," the kind of the structure"
4405080,4406760," by its size"
4406760,4407660," that you pass."
4415720,4418760," But what's interesting is that"
4418760,4420680," UNIX is not the only thing"
4420680,4421840," that does shit like that."
4421840,4424160," WinAPI does stuff like that"
4424160,4424840," all the time."
4424840,4426500," Do you guys remember"
4426500,4427960," like the usual sort of pattern"
4427960,4428720," in WinAPI"
4428720,4430160," where you create a structure"
4430160,4432480," and within the structure,"
4432480,4433460," there is a field"
4433460,4435660," into which you're supposed to write"
4435660,4437660," the size of the entire structure."
4437660,4439400," And they actually use it"
4439400,4440520," not really for polymorphies,"
4440620,4442820," but for preserving backward compatibility"
4442820,4444880," when they extend the structure."
4444880,4445800," Right."
4445800,4447420," Because you can have a user code"
4447420,4448300," that expects"
4448300,4449520," a very specific size"
4449520,4450120," of the structure."
4450120,4451380," So it limits"
4451380,4452700," how much they can change"
4452700,4453300," that structure."
4453300,4454240," Right."
4454240,4455220," And because of that,"
4455220,4456220," they force you"
4456220,4457160," to provide"
4457160,4458180," the size of the structure"
4458180,4458880," so they know"
4458880,4460340," what version of the API"
4460340,4461060," you're using"
4461060,4463020," without modifying,"
4463020,4463860," recompiling your code"
4463860,4464580," and stuff like that."
4464580,4465820," So it's kind of like"
4465820,4466780," all over the place"
4466780,4467460," in SeaWorld."
4469080,4469560," Right."
4469560,4470660," And it's nothing"
4470660,4471780," particularly new."
4471780,4472980," Right."
4472980,4473620," And it's like"
4473620,4474240," this kind of stuff"
4474240,4475220," is in the level of the kernel."
4475220,4477060," It's in the level of kernel."
4477060,4478320," Very interesting."
4478320,4479560," So anyway,"
4479560,4482180," what we want to do,"
4482180,4483260," we probably want to take"
4483260,4485700," the definition"
4485700,4486460," of the structure."
4486460,4486740," Right."
4486740,4487500," So let's actually take"
4487500,4487980," the definition"
4487980,4488620," of the structure"
4488620,4490480," and maybe copy-paste"
4490480,4491480," it somewhere here."
4491480,4493740," So I'm going to..."
4493740,4496300," That was really strange."
4496300,4498120," I thought I managed"
4498120,4499420," to copy-paste it correctly"
4499420,4500520," but I didn't"
4500520,4502400," because I'm a dummy dum-dum."
4502400,4504160," Okay."
4504160,4505860," So we need to know"
4505860,4509660," the sizes of these fields."
4509660,4510480," Right."
4510480,4511180," So we have"
4511180,4511980," these kind of fields."
4511980,4514260," So this is"
4514260,4514780," port,"
4514780,4515300," family,"
4515300,4515740," port,"
4515740,4516500," and address."
4516500,4517500," So what is"
4517500,4518340," a scene family?"
4518340,4519340," So it's defined"
4519340,4520120," somewhere here."
4520120,4521280," Sa family."
4521280,4522460," We don't really know"
4522460,4523300," the size of this"
4523300,4523940," entire thing."
4524060,4524520," so maybe"
4524520,4527560," maybe we can do"
4527560,4529380," something like this."
4529380,4531800," Can I just do that"
4531800,4532220," and see?"
4532220,4533500," Or maybe I can just"
4533500,4534400," find the definition"
4534400,4535160," of this stuff."
4535160,4536480," Maybe I can just find it."
4536480,4537040," So let's actually"
4537040,4537900," go ahead and do that."
4537900,4539140," I'm going to do"
4539140,4540600," grep rn."
4540600,4541880," It's probably something"
4541880,4542840," like a typedef."
4542840,4543620," Right."
4543620,4544100," Typedef."
4544100,4544880," Can I just put"
4544880,4546720," something like this"
4546720,4547080," in here?"
4547080,4548040," Will it find"
4548040,4549100," anything for me?"
4549100,4549760," I think it didn't"
4549760,4550820," find anything for me."
4550820,4552640," What if I remove"
4552640,4553600," I think it has to be"
4553600,4554300," also e-grep."
4554300,4555360," No, it didn't work."
4555360,4556820," I forgot the art"
4556820,4557540," of grepping,"
4557540,4558420," unfortunately."
4558420,4561700," Where is that?"
4571700,4576740," It's even not"
4576740,4577480," like a C."
4577480,4578420," It's an input"
4578420,4578940," to some sort"
4578940,4579680," of a preprocessor."
4579680,4583880," Freaking"
4583880,4588100," So usually"
4588100,4588800," the files that"
4588800,4590000," end with .in"
4590000,4591640," they're input files"
4591640,4592320," for some sort"
4592320,4593160," of a preprocessor."
4593160,4594140," So that means"
4594140,4595340," it's not the final file"
4595340,4596560," it's like generated."
4596560,4598760," Maybe depending"
4598760,4599460," on the platform"
4599460,4600340," it could be generated"
4600340,4600740," differently"
4600740,4601200," but anyway."
4601700,4602040," So"
4602040,4602880," such short"
4602880,4604040," is unsigned short"
4604040,4604640," so that means"
4604640,4606300," it's 16 bits."
4606300,4606640," Right."
4606640,4607660," So this is what we know"
4607660,4608400," for what we know."
4608400,4609880," Right."
4609880,4610800," So this is basically"
4610800,4611560," 16 bits."
4611560,4612780," Cool."
4612780,4614300," So the next thing"
4614300,4615000," is"
4615000,4616840," so in.h"
4616840,4618740," import"
4618740,4620760," another 16 bits."
4620760,4621020," Right."
4621020,4621860," So all of them"
4621860,4622740," are essentially"
4622740,4623600," 16 bits."
4623600,4626260," 16 bits."
4626260,4628160," And what about"
4628160,4629220," that one"
4629220,4630660," in address?"
4630740,4630900," Okay."
4630900,4631400," So this one"
4631400,4632020," is a structure."
4632020,4633060," All right."
4633060,4633520," So this one"
4633520,4633920," is a structure"
4633920,4634640," but there's a structure"
4634640,4635680," of a single field"
4635680,4636780," and that field"
4636780,4637400," is actually"
4637400,4639520," 32 bits."
4639520,4639820," Okay."
4639820,4640960," So we don't really"
4640960,4641620," need to create"
4641620,4642400," a separate structure."
4642400,4643140," We can just say"
4643140,4644120," that this is"
4644120,4645900," a 32-bit integer."
4645900,4646260," Right."
4646260,4647080," So that's the easiest"
4647080,4647820," thing to assume"
4647820,4648120," in here."
4648120,4649400," Like 32 bits."
4649960,4650640," and in here"
4650640,4651200," we have"
4651200,4652300," 8 bytes"
4652300,4653060," and 8 bytes"
4653060,4654060," is 64 bits."
4654060,4654420," Right."
4654420,4655020," So essentially"
4655020,4656020," if we allocate"
4656020,4657560," you know"
4657560,4658860," it's kind of funny"
4658860,4660260," that these three fields"
4660260,4661720," add up to 64 bits."
4661720,4662220," Right."
4662220,4662980," It's just basically"
4662980,4664660," two 64-bit numbers."
4664660,4664960," Right."
4664960,4665800," So"
4665800,4667080," pretty straightforward."
4667080,4669240," Spready"
4669240,4669920," straightforward."
4669920,4670820," So let's take a look"
4670820,4671280," at this thing."
4671360,4672000," So they allocated"
4672000,4674080," server ADDR."
4674080,4674800," Right."
4674800,4675460," So they allocated"
4675460,4676380," server ADDR."
4676380,4678060," So maybe"
4678060,4679080," I'm going to keep"
4679080,4679940," like all of this"
4679940,4680800," string information"
4680800,4681380," like here"
4681380,4682240," and all of the"
4682240,4683020," actual data"
4683020,4683640," is going to be"
4683640,4684620," located in here."
4684620,4684980," Right."
4684980,4685820," So the actual data."
4685820,4687280," So serve."
4687280,4688760," So how do they call that?"
4688760,4689340," They call it"
4689340,4690700," serve ADDR."
4690700,4692300," Serve ADDR."
4692300,4694260," And we're going to have"
4694260,4695160," scene family."
4695160,4695620," Right."
4695620,4696980," So this is a scene family."
4696980,4698080," And"
4698080,4699720," 16 bits"
4699720,4700520," is a word."
4700520,4700920," Right."
4701000,4701740," So this is going to be"
4701740,4702180," like this."
4702180,4703880," So then we have a port."
4703880,4704840," Then we have a port"
4704840,4706140," which is another 16 bits."
4706140,4707960," And then we have"
4707960,4709080," ADDR"
4709080,4710980," which is"
4710980,4711740," 32 bits"
4711740,4712780," which is a double word."
4712780,4713260," Right."
4713260,4713780," So DD."
4713780,4715940," And then we have"
4715940,4716920," a little bit of a padding."
4716920,4718180," And I think I'm going"
4718180,4719040," to respect"
4719040,4719860," that padding."
4719860,4721320," So we're going to have"
4721320,4721920," scene 0."
4721920,4724040," And I can just use"
4724040,4724740," DQ"
4724740,4725860," which is basically"
4725860,4726800," 64 bits."
4726800,4727640," And you know"
4727640,4729600," is it really true?"
4729600,4730060," 8"
4730060,4731760," I'm pretty sure"
4731760,4732160," it is."
4732160,4733080," So 8"
4733080,4733940," 8 multiplied by"
4733940,4734340," 864."
4734340,4734680," Okay."
4734680,4735580," So I had a little bit"
4735580,4736220," of a brain fart."
4736220,4737000," I do remember"
4737000,4738320," how the math works."
4738320,4738640," Okay."
4738640,4739980," Just had a little bit"
4739980,4740620," of a brain fart."
4740620,4741620," So"
4741620,4743960," and the next thing"
4743960,4744840," we can also define"
4744840,4745840," is something like"
4745840,4746660," size of"
4746660,4748240," serve ADDR"
4748240,4749340," which is equal"
4749340,4749800," to"
4749800,4750880," current address"
4750880,4751440," minus"
4751440,4752180," the beginning"
4752180,4753200," of this entire thing."
4753800,4754060," right."
4754060,4755080," And this is basically"
4755080,4756480," how we can allocate"
4756480,4757600," this specific structure."
4757600,4758860," I think it does"
4758860,4759440," make sense."
4759440,4759820," Right."
4759820,4760440," I think it does"
4760440,4760920," make sense."
4760920,4762580," That's basically"
4762580,4763200," what it is."
4763200,4765220," Yes."
4765220,4765500," Yes."
4765500,4765500," Yes."
4765500,4770020," So"
4770020,4770900," maybe I'm going to"
4770900,4771620," even put"
4771620,4772700," this definition"
4772700,4773480," on top"
4773480,4774060," in here"
4774060,4774760," so it is"
4774760,4775500," kind of relevant."
4775500,4777240," Maybe we're going"
4777240,4777960," to even use"
4777960,4778480," the"
4778480,4781260," fosm struct thingy."
4781260,4782080," Maybe we should use"
4782080,4783040," a fosm struct thingy"
4783040,4783860," but I'm not really sure"
4783860,4784500," how exactly"
4784500,4785300," we're going to do that yet."
4785300,4786500," Anyways."
4786500,4788360," So"
4788360,4789000," let's start"
4789000,4789960," populating things."
4789960,4790500," Let's start"
4790500,4791380," populating things."
4791380,4793100," We need to do"
4793100,4794120," this kind of stuff."
4794120,4795000," Right."
4795000,4797760," So"
4797760,4798260," that means"
4798260,4799080," we need to take"
4799080,4800240," this stuff"
4800240,4801220," right"
4801220,4802100," and"
4802100,4804440," dereference"
4804440,4805380," this specific pointer"
4805380,4806000," because when you"
4806000,4806960," refer to the name"
4806960,4807860," you're referring to"
4807860,4808640," the address"
4808640,4809880," where that specific"
4809880,4811120," field is located."
4811120,4811840," You're referring to"
4811840,4812320," an address."
4812320,4812940," So"
4812940,4813580," in fosm"
4813580,4814780," in Intel assembly"
4814780,4816440," by dereferencing"
4816440,4817720," you just put it in brackets."
4817720,4818300," You're effectively"
4818300,4819660," dereferencing this thing."
4819660,4820720," Right."
4820720,4821400," And what we want to"
4821400,4822760," save at that specific address"
4822760,4823480," we want to save"
4823480,4824780," ifinet."
4824780,4825640," But you have to be"
4825640,4826260," very careful."
4826260,4826980," Right."
4826980,4827700," So because"
4827700,4829500," you want to do"
4829500,4831560," 16-bit write"
4831560,4832460," so we want to say"
4832460,4833180," it's a word."
4833180,4833920," Right."
4833920,4834760," So you want to say"
4834760,4835280," it's a word."
4835280,4836440," Okay."
4836440,4837080," And this one is"
4837080,4837720," very interesting."
4837760,4838000," okay."
4838000,4838900," So"
4838900,4840260," here you have to"
4840260,4840600," provide"
4840600,4842080," basically"
4842080,4844580," the address"
4844580,4845440," right"
4845440,4847160," in the"
4847160,4848480," network order."
4848480,4849920," So"
4849920,4851320," as far as I know"
4851320,4853060," the order"
4853060,4854880," in x86-64"
4854880,4855500," is the least"
4855500,4856740," significant byte."
4856740,4857060," Right."
4857060,4857720," So"
4857720,4858640," and the network order"
4858640,4859100," is actually"
4859100,4860160," most significant byte"
4860160,4860820," and because of that"
4860820,4862020," we have this sort of"
4862020,4863040," functions that"
4863040,4864100," revert bytes"
4864100,4864880," when necessary."
4865540,4866060," so"
4866060,4867700," I know for sure"
4867700,4868300," if you are"
4868300,4870140," on x86-64"
4870140,4870980," you always need"
4870980,4871800," to revert the bytes."
4871800,4872460," Right."
4872460,4873060," So it's a little"
4873060,4873600," big ending."
4873600,4873900," Yeah."
4873900,4875180," So chat says"
4875180,4875860," little big ending."
4875860,4878020," So as far as I know"
4878020,4878800," in case of"
4878800,4880280," in ADDR any"
4880280,4880860," you don't really"
4880860,4881600," have to do"
4881600,4882440," anything much."
4882440,4882720," Right."
4882780,4883660," so if you go here"
4883660,4885220," and I say"
4885220,4887980," in ADDR any"
4887980,4889300," I think it is"
4889300,4890000," equal to zero."
4890000,4890720," I think it's"
4890720,4891680," straight up equal to zero"
4891680,4892280," so we don't even"
4892280,4893340," have to worry about that."
4893340,4894500," So let me"
4894500,4895180," let me see."
4895180,4896980," So"
4896980,4898480," in ADDR any"
4898480,4899380," so maybe we need"
4899380,4900120," to include"
4900120,4901320," additional stuff."
4903760,4904840," I don't remember"
4904840,4907040," what kind of stuff"
4907040,4908380," we have to include."
4908380,4911840," So let me see"
4911840,4912700," what we include"
4912700,4913200," in here"
4913200,4913840," up there."
4913840,4914800," So we have socket"
4914800,4915360," maybe we need"
4915360,4916180," to also include"
4916180,4916700," additional"
4916700,4917420," these things"
4917420,4917740," net"
4917740,4918120," db"
4918120,4918440," net"
4918440,4918760," in"
4918760,4919200," in"
4919200,4919400," dot"
4919400,4919720," h"
4919720,4920200," and stuff"
4920200,4920780," like that."
4920780,4922420," So"
4922420,4923300," there we go."
4923300,4924000," We definitely"
4924000,4924820," need this kind"
4924820,4925220," of stuff."
4925220,4927620," Oh it's zero."
4927620,4928180," There we go."
4928640,4929260," So and"
4929260,4931000," zero is represented"
4931000,4931540," by"
4931540,4932860," you know"
4932860,4933540," all bytes"
4933540,4934240," being zero."
4934240,4935560," So it doesn't"
4935560,4936020," really matter"
4936020,4936660," if like"
4936660,4937160," what is"
4937160,4938080," lsb or"
4938080,4938820," you know"
4938820,4939660," msb"
4939660,4940380," and stuff like that."
4940380,4941000," It doesn't matter."
4941000,4942080," So zero is zero."
4942080,4943480," Zero is zero."
4943480,4945260," So because of that"
4945260,4946400," I think we can"
4946400,4946840," just"
4946840,4948440," we can just"
4948440,4949180," use it as it is."
4949180,4951140," So this is"
4951140,4951800," going to be like that."
4951800,4953040," Move."
4953040,4956460," But in our case"
4956460,4958300," the name of the field"
4958300,4958680," is just"
4958680,4959520," sinaddr."
4959520,4960440," Yeah it is"
4960440,4960960," sinaddr"
4960960,4961740," so we need to"
4961740,4962420," do it like that."
4962420,4963160," And"
4963160,4964300," adddrany"
4964300,4965020," there we go."
4965020,4966400," So but what's"
4966400,4967280," the size of this"
4967280,4967580," thing?"
4967580,4968300," It's"
4968300,4969980," it's 32 bits."
4969980,4973240," It's 32 bits."
4973240,4974560," Okay."
4974560,4975140," It's kind of"
4975140,4975440," interesting."
4975440,4976740," Why are they"
4976740,4977500," filling them up"
4977500,4978700," in kind of"
4978700,4979140," a weird"
4979140,4979660," order?"
4979660,4980700," Because"
4980700,4981660," after that"
4981660,4982180," you have a"
4982180,4982540," port"
4982540,4983420," not the"
4983420,4984140," address."
4984140,4985940," But anyway"
4985940,4986640," so it's just"
4986640,4987800," gigs for gigs"
4987800,4988280," am I right?"
4988280,4988560," right?"
4988560,4989380," So after"
4989380,4989940," family you"
4989940,4990480," have port"
4990480,4991480," and then"
4991480,4991840," you have"
4991840,4992260," address."
4992260,4992800," But they"
4992800,4993120," actually"
4993120,4993760," filling it up."
4993760,4995360," Jesus."
4995360,4997120," Alright."
4997120,4997700," So this is"
4997700,4997980," going to be"
4997980,4998260," that."
4998260,4999280," And the"
4999280,4999680," size of"
4999680,5000160," this thing"
5000160,5000920," is actually"
5000920,5001760," double word."
5001760,5002200," So it's"
5002200,5002840," a D word."
5002840,5003720," Right."
5003720,5004520," It's a D word."
5004520,5006320," Right."
5006320,5006760," And then"
5006760,5007340," we need to"
5007340,5007920," say the"
5007920,5008160," port."
5008160,5008620," Okay."
5008620,5008880," And the"
5008880,5009160," port is"
5009160,5009300," going to"
5009300,5009400," be"
5009400,5009680," interesting."
5009680,5010580," So I"
5010580,5011220," want the"
5011220,5011640," port to"
5011640,5011840," be"
5011840,5012380," 69."
5012380,5012920," 69."
5012920,5014740," But I"
5014740,5015280," can't really"
5015280,5015660," do that"
5015660,5015980," because it"
5015980,5016400," has to be"
5016400,5016880," the bytes"
5016880,5017320," have to"
5017320,5017660," be in"
5017660,5017760," a"
5017760,5018020," reversed"
5018020,5018380," order."
5018380,5019800," So I"
5019800,5020620," either have"
5020620,5021120," to implement"
5021120,5021760," age tones"
5021760,5022240," which I"
5022240,5022720," don't really"
5022720,5023400," want but I"
5023400,5024120," could but I"
5024120,5024660," don't want"
5024660,5025240," to do that."
5025240,5027540," What we"
5027540,5028340," can do in"
5028340,5029360," fact we"
5029360,5030140," can do an"
5030140,5030880," interesting trick."
5031040,5031260," so let's"
5031260,5031660," actually take"
5031660,5032120," 69."
5032120,5032500," 69."
5032500,5033060," This is"
5033060,5033300," in a"
5033300,5033700," decimal"
5033700,5034700," representation."
5034700,5035400," Let's"
5035400,5035800," actually turn"
5035800,5036060," it in"
5036060,5036320," hex."
5036320,5039320," Hex has"
5039320,5039880," a very"
5039880,5041260," cool side"
5041260,5041660," effect."
5041660,5042040," It's"
5042040,5042860," basically one"
5042860,5043160," of the"
5043160,5043840," reasons why"
5043840,5044580," people use"
5044580,5045080," hex."
5045080,5046360," So the"
5046360,5046720," reason why"
5046720,5047120," people use"
5047120,5047500," hex is"
5047500,5048160," because these"
5048160,5049440," specific bytes"
5049440,5050480," of a number"
5050480,5051560," are visible."
5051560,5052980," Each pair"
5052980,5053560," of bytes"
5053560,5054600," in hexadecimal"
5054600,5055220," representation"
5055220,5057920," is a"
5057920,5058200," byte."
5058200,5058960," Right."
5059080,5059760," So basically"
5059760,5060740," this number"
5060740,5061340," is represented"
5061340,5061860," by two"
5061860,5062140," bytes."
5062140,5062520," The first"
5062520,5063220," one 1b"
5063220,5063900," and 39."
5063900,5064900," So if you"
5064900,5065280," want to"
5065280,5066840," invert the"
5066840,5067300," order of"
5067300,5068120," bytes you"
5068120,5068580," can literally"
5068580,5068980," do the"
5068980,5069180," following"
5069180,5069540," thing."
5069540,5071460," There you"
5071460,5071620," go."
5071620,5073820," So this"
5073820,5074760," is in"
5074760,5076120," essentially"
5076120,5077420," in a"
5077420,5077940," network"
5077940,5078280," order."
5078280,5080840," So you"
5080840,5081100," can just"
5081100,5082380," manually swap"
5082380,5082760," them and"
5082760,5083160," this is the"
5083160,5083560," value that"
5083560,5084000," you basically"
5084000,5084520," have to put"
5084520,5084760," in a"
5084760,5084940," port."
5089080,5090440," And it's"
5090440,5090760," going to"
5090760,5090980," work."
5090980,5091740," So that's"
5091740,5092900," why people"
5092900,5093780," use hexadecimal"
5093780,5094180," representation"
5094180,5094640," because you"
5094640,5095040," can see"
5095040,5096120," individual"
5096120,5096600," bytes,"
5096600,5097520," individual"
5097520,5098280," nibbles."
5098280,5098960," So some"
5098960,5099380," people say"
5099380,5099820," that four"
5099820,5100300," bits is a"
5100300,5100520," nibble."
5100520,5101920," So each"
5101920,5103160," digit in"
5103160,5103700," hexadecimal"
5103700,5104120," representation"
5104120,5104600," is a"
5104600,5104920," single"
5104920,5105600," nibble which"
5105600,5105940," is four"
5105940,5106240," bytes."
5106240,5107520," So two"
5107520,5107900," of them"
5107900,5109620," is four"
5109620,5110180," bits."
5110180,5110780," So two"
5110780,5111060," of them"
5111060,5111740," is eight"
5111740,5112040," bytes,"
5112040,5112460," a single"
5112460,5112660," byte."
5113660,5114220," I keep"
5114220,5114660," confusing"
5114660,5114840," the"
5114840,5115260," terminology"
5115260,5115940," so I'm"
5115940,5116100," a little"
5116100,5116500," bit tired"
5116500,5116860," but you"
5116860,5117240," get what"
5117240,5117580," I mean"
5117580,5118080," hopefully."
5118080,5120560," Anyway"
5120560,5122400," so let's"
5122400,5123020," actually save"
5123020,5123580," this value"
5123580,5124780," to that"
5124780,5125160," specific"
5125160,5125500," field."
5125500,5125980," So this"
5125980,5126200," is going"
5126200,5126600," to work"
5126600,5128040," like so."
5128040,5128380," There we"
5128380,5128520," go."
5128520,5129060," And we"
5129060,5129860," just filled"
5129860,5130820," up the"
5130820,5131140," entire"
5131140,5131520," structure."
5131520,5131860," So I"
5131860,5132220," actually want"
5132220,5132560," to preserve"
5132560,5133020," the order"
5133020,5133560," as it"
5133560,5133920," is in"
5133920,5134260," the memory"
5134260,5134760," because in"
5134760,5135020," the memory"
5135020,5135440," first we"
5135440,5135580," have"
5135580,5135860," family"
5135860,5136180," port"
5136180,5136360," and"
5136360,5136760," address."
5136760,5137660," Zero"
5137660,5137940," we're"
5137940,5138140," not going"
5138140,5138960," to put"
5138960,5139320," anything"
5139320,5139680," in there."
5139680,5140040," It's"
5140040,5140440," basically"
5140440,5140940," the padding"
5140940,5141320," to"
5141320,5142040," preserve"
5142040,5142720," very specific"
5142720,5143100," size"
5143660,5143780," structure"
5143780,5144100," I"
5144100,5144720," suppose"
5144720,5146400," very"
5146400,5146720," specific"
5146720,5147000," size"
5147000,5147100," of"
5147100,5147220," the"
5147220,5147480," structure"
5147480,5148200," so that's"
5148200,5148540," fine."
5148540,5150400," And yeah"
5150400,5150660," there we"
5150660,5150760," go."
5150760,5151240," We filled"
5151240,5151440," up"
5151440,5151880," everything."
5151880,5152700," So the"
5152700,5153000," next thing"
5153000,5153240," we need"
5153240,5153420," to do"
5153420,5153740," we just"
5153740,5153900," need"
5153900,5154040," to"
5154040,5154420," call"
5154420,5155160," bind."
5155160,5155860," So we"
5155860,5155980," need"
5155980,5156080," to"
5156080,5156260," call"
5156260,5156620," bind."
5156620,5159200," So in"
5159200,5159580," bind in"
5159580,5159980," our case"
5159980,5160200," is going"
5160200,5160400," to be"
5160400,5160620," sock"
5160620,5160860," of"
5160860,5161040," d."
5161040,5161720," We already"
5161720,5162020," have"
5162020,5162380," sock"
5162380,5162540," of"
5162540,5162700," d"
5162700,5163120," located"
5163120,5163300," in"
5163300,5163480," here"
5163480,5163900," so we're"
5163900,5164100," reading"
5164100,5164300," it"
5164300,5164500," and"
5164500,5164780," putting"
5164780,5164940," it"
5164940,5165060," in"
5165060,5165240," here."
5165240,5166260," So now"
5166260,5166560," we have"
5166560,5166900," to provide"
5166900,5167420," the pointer"
5167420,5167880," to the"
5167880,5168300," serve"
5168300,5168780," address"
5168780,5169440," structure"
5169440,5170420," so what"
5170420,5170620," we're going"
5170620,5170980," to provide"
5170980,5171260," we're going"
5171260,5171460," to just"
5171460,5172120," provide the"
5172120,5173020," scene"
5173020,5173440," family"
5173440,5174100," because this"
5174100,5174380," is the"
5174380,5175100," first field"
5175100,5175700," so it"
5175700,5176260," points at"
5176260,5176580," the beginning"
5176580,5176900," of the"
5176900,5177220," structure"
5177220,5177620," so by"
5177620,5178260," pointing at"
5178260,5179000," that specific"
5179000,5179340," field"
5179340,5180060," we point"
5180060,5180440," at the"
5180440,5180760," entire"
5180760,5181320," structure"
5181320,5181860," right"
5181860,5182480," we just"
5182480,5183020," point at"
5183020,5183380," the entire"
5183380,5183840," structure"
5183840,5184480," and then"
5184480,5184960," here we"
5184960,5185520," provide the"
5185520,5185900," size of"
5185900,5186340," this entire"
5186340,5186760," structure"
5186760,5187240," so that's"
5187240,5187580," basically"
5187580,5188780," so and"
5188780,5189220," after that"
5189220,5189640," we may"
5189640,5190160," also"
5190160,5192340," like to"
5192340,5193240," check for"
5193240,5193600," errors"
5193600,5194180," check for"
5194180,5194540," potential"
5194540,5195040," errors"
5195040,5195380," right"
5195380,5195740," so in"
5195740,5196040," case of"
5196040,5196280," an error"
5196280,5196560," we're going"
5196560,5196880," to go"
5196880,5197220," to the"
5197220,5197540," error"
5197540,5197960," handling"
5197960,5198380," code"
5198380,5199280," and just"
5199280,5199800," like do"
5199800,5200140," it like"
5200140,5200440," that"
5200440,5202720," so that's"
5202720,5203020," pretty"
5203020,5203600," that's"
5203600,5204140," pretty cool"
5204140,5204700," it would be"
5204700,5205380," also nice"
5205380,5206220," to maybe"
5206220,5206920," write a"
5206920,5207280," message"
5207280,5207740," right"
5207740,5208020," something"
5208020,5208340," like"
5208340,5208800," write"
5208800,5209680," std"
5209680,5210060," out"
5210060,5211620," and here"
5211620,5211860," we're going"
5211860,5212200," to have"
5212200,5212800," maybe I'm"
5212800,5212960," going to"
5212960,5213120," even"
5213120,5213640," copy-paste"
5213640,5213920," that"
5213920,5214340," specific"
5214340,5214700," line"
5214700,5215060," and I'm"
5215060,5215200," going to"
5215200,5215580," replace"
5215580,5216400," socket"
5216400,5216880," with"
5216880,5217300," bind"
5217300,5217920," so now"
5217920,5218220," we have"
5218220,5218740," a bind"
5218740,5219300," trace"
5219300,5221000," information"
5221000,5221500," right"
5221500,5223260," so first"
5223260,5223980," we're saying"
5223980,5225240," what's the"
5225240,5225880," action we're"
5225880,5226140," doing"
5226140,5226740," we're filling"
5226740,5227240," up this"
5227240,5227700," structure"
5227700,5228560," that explains"
5228560,5229020," what kind"
5229020,5229320," of socket"
5229320,5229620," we want"
5229620,5229940," to have"
5229940,5230540," it's an"
5230540,5230780," internet"
5230780,5231160," socket"
5231160,5231640," at the"
5231640,5231840," port"
5231840,5232760," 6969"
5232760,5233360," that accepts"
5233360,5233880," connections"
5233880,5234980," from anywhere"
5234980,5235460," right"
5235460,5235820," so because"
5235820,5236120," it's all"
5236120,5236400," zero"
5236400,5237040," then we"
5237040,5237260," perform"
5237260,5237680," the byte"
5237680,5238300," and then"
5238300,5238620," check for"
5238620,5238960," the error"
5238960,5239680," and so on"
5239680,5240260," and so"
5240260,5240640," forth"
5240640,5241940," so but"
5241940,5242200," the thing"
5242200,5242420," we need"
5242420,5242720," to have"
5242720,5243000," we need"
5243000,5243380," to have"
5243380,5243740," the"
5243740,5244400," bind"
5244400,5244900," macro"
5244900,5245180," right"
5245180,5245540," so we"
5245540,5246260," didn't create"
5246260,5246680," the bind"
5246680,5247060," macro"
5247060,5247480," yet"
5247480,5248120," so let's"
5248120,5248380," go ahead"
5248380,5248680," and do"
5248680,5248960," that"
5248960,5249440," i think"
5249440,5249820," that would"
5249820,5250040," be"
5250040,5251340," very beneficial"
5251340,5252640," for us"
5252640,5253480," and potentially"
5253480,5254360," the humanity"
5254360,5255600," who fucking knows"
5255600,5256300," i don't fucking"
5256300,5256780," know probably"
5256780,5257140," not"
5257140,5258740," nothing i do"
5258740,5260140," is beneficial"
5260140,5260880," for humanity"
5260880,5263240," so here are the"
5263240,5263680," parameters"
5263680,5264320," so sock"
5264320,5264720," socfd"
5264720,5264760," socfd"
5264760,5266500," socfd"
5266500,5268240," adddr"
5268240,5268960," adddr"
5268960,5269340," len"
5269340,5271400," so let's"
5271400,5271660," do"
5271660,5272600," move"
5272600,5273240," racks"
5273240,5274200," sysbind"
5274200,5274760," so we need"
5274760,5275120," to know"
5275120,5276140," this thing"
5276140,5277000," move"
5277000,5277800," rdi"
5277800,5279240," socfd"
5279240,5280800," then"
5280800,5281700," rsi"
5281700,5283920," adddr"
5283920,5286380," rdx"
5286380,5287260," adddr"
5287260,5287520," len"
5287520,5288340," so we"
5288340,5288920," have a lot"
5288920,5289580," of repetitions"
5289580,5289960," in here"
5289960,5290420," in how"
5290420,5290720," we"
5290720,5291960," do"
5291960,5292360," the"
5292360,5292800," syscalls"
5292800,5294120," maybe in the future"
5294120,5294880," we're going to define"
5294880,5295780," a bunch of"
5295780,5296540," macros"
5296540,5297340," things like"
5297340,5298300," macro"
5298300,5299880," syscall"
5299880,5300500," 3"
5300500,5301960," doesn't it remind you"
5301960,5302380," something"
5302380,5304540," doesn't it remind you"
5304540,5304860," something"
5304860,5307600," right"
5307600,5308580," where we could"
5308580,5309600," maybe even"
5309600,5311360," like a number"
5311360,5313400," and essentially"
5313400,5315040," we can just do it"
5315040,5315580," like that"
5315580,5318500," number"
5318500,5320060," and then"
5320060,5320440," a"
5320440,5321480," b"
5321480,5322240," c"
5322240,5323520," right"
5323520,5324600," and when we do"
5324600,5325000," bind"
5325000,5326240," we can essentially"
5326240,5326680," do"
5326680,5328020," syscall"
5328020,5328860," 3"
5328860,5330680," sysbind"
5330680,5332540," socfd"
5332540,5333700," adddr"
5333700,5334320," adddr"
5334320,5334700," len"
5334700,5336040," and"
5336040,5336600," like that"
5336600,5338120," so"
5338120,5340720," yeah"
5340720,5341300," people say"
5341300,5341580," port"
5341580,5342200," exactly"
5342200,5343340," so"
5343340,5346380," yeah"
5346380,5347080," and you can"
5347080,5347560," predefine"
5347560,5347800," like"
5347800,5349480," different syscalls"
5349480,5350200," and stuff like that"
5350200,5351480," I'm pretty sure"
5351480,5352340," maybe you can even"
5352340,5353620," make this"
5353620,5354080," number"
5354080,5354780," a parameter"
5354780,5355440," of the macro"
5355440,5356220," itself"
5356220,5357100," and maybe you can"
5357100,5358140," sort of switch case"
5358140,5358740," based on that"
5358740,5359220," or something"
5359220,5359920," I don't really know"
5359920,5360840," it's also kind of"
5360840,5361400," nice to"
5361400,5363240," explore"
5363240,5364180," if macro system"
5364180,5365200," has variatics"
5365200,5366720," so"
5366720,5368080," and basically"
5368080,5368940," do not pass"
5368940,5369460," this thing"
5369460,5369920," at all"
5369920,5370280," but I mean"
5370280,5370960," syscall is already"
5370960,5371260," taken"
5371260,5372620," so we'll have to"
5372620,5373100," call it somehow"
5373100,5373540," differently"
5373540,5373820," but"
5373820,5375440," that's an interesting"
5375440,5375760," idea"
5375760,5376080," nonetheless"
5376080,5377080," yeah"
5377080,5378520," it's an interesting"
5378520,5379200," idea nonetheless"
5379200,5380140," so then we perform"
5380140,5380640," the bind"
5380640,5381180," and"
5381180,5382080," so we have a"
5382080,5382940," bind trace"
5382940,5386200," so we need to"
5386200,5386880," replace socket"
5386880,5387640," with bind"
5387640,5389240," and here"
5389240,5390000," say binding"
5390000,5391360," the socket"
5391360,5393160," there you go"
5393160,5395340," binding"
5395340,5396100," le socket"
5396100,5397200," le socket"
5397200,5398560," okay"
5398560,5399720," so can I just"
5399720,5400560," now compile"
5400560,5401400," this entire thing"
5401400,5401860," so I'm going to do"
5401860,5402180," fasm"
5402180,5403260," website"
5403260,5404200," ozm"
5404200,5404740," no"
5404740,5405400," fasm"
5405400,5406180," fasm"
5406180,5407960," there we go"
5407960,5408560," so let's go"
5408560,5409200," through the compilation"
5409200,5409540," errors"
5409540,5410900," so operand"
5410900,5411800," size do not"
5411800,5412260," match"
5412260,5412700," okay"
5412700,5413180," that's very"
5413180,5413640," interesting"
5413640,5415720," so it's"
5415720,5416660," at the"
5416660,5418600," 38"
5418600,5419500," it's at"
5419500,5420140," 38"
5420140,5421880," uh-huh"
5421880,5424020," oh that's"
5424020,5424720," very interesting"
5424720,5426920," is that because"
5426920,5428380," when we do"
5428380,5429140," sock of d"
5429140,5430340," we have to"
5430340,5431880," oh"
5431880,5432860," this one is"
5432860,5433340," interesting"
5433340,5435560," because it's"
5435560,5435800," a"
5435800,5437560," double word"
5437560,5438160," and we're"
5438160,5438480," saving"
5438480,5439380," okay I see"
5439380,5441500," it's a double word"
5441500,5442380," but we're saving it"
5442380,5443260," to 64-bit"
5443260,5444560," register"
5444560,5447320," so what if"
5447320,5448020," we just do"
5448020,5448700," dq"
5448700,5451300," and make it"
5451300,5451820," 64"
5451820,5452760," right"
5452760,5453460," and every time"
5453460,5454440," we're sort of like"
5454440,5456460," yeah I think that would be better"
5456460,5458300," that would actually solve the problem"
5458300,5459920," so let me see"
5459920,5460740," so we bind"
5460740,5461660," this is 64"
5461660,5462320," and here"
5462320,5463980," I will have to use racks"
5463980,5465120," in that specific case"
5465120,5467240," and this is a keyword"
5467240,5468780," yeah that would be better"
5468780,5470500," it's actually kind of cool"
5470500,5471560," that it checks the sizes"
5471560,5472900," I thought it doesn't check them"
5472900,5473920," yeah"
5473920,5474580," all right"
5474580,5476400," so it kind of checks the sizes"
5476400,5478240," so and define simple"
5478240,5479000," in address"
5479000,5479500," any"
5479500,5480740," did I define it really"
5480740,5481900," I didn't define it apparently"
5481900,5482760," okay so that's"
5482760,5483260," that's fine"
5483260,5485820," so let's say that it's going to be zero"
5485820,5487140," it's supposed to be zero"
5487140,5489260," undefined symbol"
5489260,5489800," sysbind"
5489800,5491160," so let's actually define it"
5491160,5491780," sysbind"
5491780,5494220," so the error messages"
5494220,5495080," are reasonable enough"
5495080,5495560," so far"
5495560,5498780," I'm really glad"
5498780,5500040," so let's find"
5500040,5501680," the bind thing"
5501680,5502420," 49"
5502420,5502920," okay"
5502920,5504920," there we go"
5504920,5505540," so"
5505540,5507160," do we manage to compile this thing"
5507160,5508960," and we successfully compile this"
5508960,5514060," is it not"
5514060,5514880," a poggers"
5514880,5516780," we can try to run it"
5516780,5517880," and see if it's going to be"
5517880,5518660," successfully run"
5518660,5519360," no no"
5519360,5520780," so it successfully bound"
5520780,5521380," the socket"
5521380,5521900," right"
5521900,5522840," so creating the socket"
5522840,5523680," bound the socket"
5523680,5524660," and so on and so forth"
5524660,5526400," right"
5526400,5527280," so one of the things"
5527280,5528080," we probably want to do"
5528080,5528580," as well"
5528580,5529580," is maybe"
5529580,5530740," close the socket"
5530740,5531520," at the end"
5531520,5532220," when we print"
5532220,5533640," okay message"
5533640,5534620," we probably want to"
5534620,5535720," go ahead and just"
5535720,5536360," close"
5536360,5538040," the sockfd"
5538040,5539820," right"
5539820,5541580," so just in case"
5541580,5542340," so we"
5542340,5543240," deallocate the resources"
5543240,5543980," and stuff like that"
5543980,5545860," maybe we want to even"
5545860,5547120," do that on error as well"
5547120,5548740," so maybe we're going to"
5548740,5549680," do that on error as well"
5549680,5551200," but this is a little bit"
5551200,5552120," you know"
5552120,5553020," probably dangerous"
5553020,5554060," probably not"
5554060,5555720," because what if you"
5555720,5557000," errored at the phase"
5557000,5558020," of creating the socket"
5558020,5559460," so you don't have"
5559460,5560540," a valid socket ID"
5560540,5561820," how can you close"
5561820,5563420," an invalid socket ID"
5563420,5565060," you can't"
5565060,5566240," you can't really close"
5566240,5567180," the invalid socket ID"
5567180,5568000," and because of that"
5568000,5568940," close will return"
5568940,5569580," minus one"
5569580,5571620," but I mean"
5571620,5572680," do you care"
5572680,5573580," it's not going to"
5573580,5574720," crash your application"
5574720,5576120," it's just going to"
5576120,5576440," tell you"
5576440,5577560," oh you provided"
5577560,5578580," an invalid ID"
5578580,5579480," so what"
5579480,5581760," right"
5581760,5583060," if I provide"
5583060,5583720," invalid ID"
5583720,5584420," it will return"
5584420,5584980," minus one"
5584980,5585660," if I provide"
5585660,5586300," valid one"
5586300,5587180," it will close it"
5587180,5587820," and return zero"
5587820,5588860," in both of the cases"
5588860,5589540," it will just do"
5589540,5590720," exactly what we want"
5590720,5591800," so who cares"
5591800,5592920," right"
5592920,5593600," we're not going to"
5593600,5593960," check that"
5593960,5594800," I'm not even checking"
5594800,5595540," errors for these"
5595540,5596040," kind of things"
5596040,5596820," like we already"
5596820,5597440," got an error"
5597440,5598480," I don't care"
5598480,5599120," if this message"
5599120,5599860," will go through"
5599860,5600960," I'll just throw it"
5600960,5601700," and just die"
5601700,5602860," so"
5602860,5605200," I don't think"
5605200,5606180," there is any sense"
5606180,5606860," in checking"
5606860,5607620," whether the sockfd"
5607620,5608460," is valid or not"
5608460,5609820," right"
5609820,5610820," so what's the point"
5610820,5611160," of checking"
5611160,5611740," whether it's valid"
5611740,5612460," if it's invalid"
5612460,5613300," it's not going to"
5613300,5614220," crash our application"
5614220,5614600," we're going to"
5614600,5614920," continue"
5614920,5616140," we want to forget"
5616140,5616840," about this socket"
5616840,5617900," ID"
5617900,5619260," after we close it"
5619260,5620400," after close"
5620400,5621800," we already assume"
5621800,5622420," that it's invalid"
5622420,5623800," so it doesn't matter"
5623800,5624520," if it was invalid"
5624520,5625080," before that"
5625080,5626720," it just doesn't matter"
5626720,5628020," but it makes"
5628020,5628940," the code simpler"
5628940,5630520," just not caring"
5630520,5631280," whether it's valid"
5631280,5631840," or invalid"
5631840,5633300," makes everything simpler"
5633300,5634520," you see what I'm"
5634520,5635040," talking about"
5635040,5636900," right"
5636900,5638060," because this is"
5638060,5638580," something that I"
5638580,5639440," used to fuzz"
5639440,5640300," about"
5640300,5641720," for a long time"
5641720,5642520," and it would"
5642520,5643160," make my code"
5643160,5643820," more complicated"
5643820,5644280," because I would"
5644280,5644840," have to make"
5644840,5646020," additional checks"
5646020,5646760," and stuff like that"
5646760,5647920," but if you just say"
5647920,5648880," I don't care"
5648880,5649280," if it's valid"
5649280,5649680," or not"
5649680,5651260," I'm going to assume"
5651260,5651840," that it's invalid"
5651840,5653300," after it's closed"
5653300,5654420," so it doesn't matter"
5654420,5655140," just close it"
5655140,5656360," so"
5656360,5657260," yeah"
5657260,5657680," I think"
5657680,5659000," it simplifies everything"
5659000,5659900," and when you're"
5659900,5660540," programming an assembly"
5660540,5661680," you really want to go"
5661680,5662620," for simpler solutions"
5662620,5663360," because they're going to"
5663360,5664360," make your life simpler"
5664360,5664620," right"
5664620,5665360," you're already working"
5665360,5665940," with a very"
5665940,5667140," terse language"
5667140,5668360," so why making it"
5668360,5669220," even more complicated"
5669220,5669760," than it's needed"
5669760,5674660," so"
5674660,5679620," the question is"
5679620,5680540," will this web server"
5680540,5681060," in assembly"
5681060,5681880," win in speed"
5681880,5682800," a RAS"
5682800,5683600," Tokyo web server"
5683600,5685080," this specific"
5685080,5685600," implementation"
5685600,5686460," no"
5686460,5687220," probably not"
5687220,5691420," because to be fair"
5691420,5691980," the performance"
5691980,5692720," of the web server"
5692720,5693860," has almost nothing"
5693860,5694540," to do with"
5694540,5695780," how optimal"
5695780,5697020," this sequence"
5697020,5697960," of extraction is"
5697960,5699920," it's more of a"
5699920,5701780," how well you handle"
5701780,5702180," the IO"
5702180,5703440," right"
5703440,5704600," because it's not really"
5704600,5705620," like CPU bound"
5705620,5706720," it's usually IO bound"
5706720,5707600," so it's kind of like"
5707600,5708560," a different kind of problem"
5708560,5709320," that you have to solve"
5709320,5710780," so I didn't think so"
5710780,5712000," unless I"
5712000,5713600," specifically"
5713600,5714320," like"
5714320,5715760," work on"
5715760,5717080," better"
5717080,5718740," IO handling"
5718740,5719460," so"
5719460,5721020," in the current"
5721020,5721620," implementation"
5721620,5722060," I don't think"
5722060,5722720," it's going to be faster"
5722720,5725280," all right"
5725280,5727740," so"
5727740,5728540," what we're"
5728540,5729500," what we're about to use"
5729500,5730520," we're just about to use"
5730520,5730980," like a regular"
5730980,5731780," reads and writes"
5731780,5732340," right"
5732340,5732980," and it's just like"
5732980,5733600," we're not"
5733600,5734180," we're not going to even"
5734180,5735220," use send file"
5735220,5736180," right now"
5736180,5738000," and people mention"
5738000,5738640," IO Uring"
5738640,5739320," and stuff like that"
5739320,5739540," yeah"
5739540,5744060," okay go"
5744060,5746420," so we bound"
5746420,5747240," everything successfully"
5747240,5748080," after we bound"
5748080,5749540," the socket"
5749540,5750280," le socket"
5750280,5752280," we basically"
5752280,5753260," set what kind of"
5753260,5754260," port we expect"
5754260,5754640," from it"
5754640,5755420," the next thing"
5755420,5755980," we have to do"
5755980,5756560," we have to"
5756560,5757840," listen to that"
5757840,5758500," le socket"
5758500,5759860," we have to listen"
5759860,5760560," to that le socket"
5760560,5761620," so what does it mean"
5761620,5762760," so it also accepts"
5762760,5764420," like a second argument"
5764420,5765640," it accepts five"
5765640,5766620," for whatever freaking"
5766620,5766880," reason"
5766880,5767540," so I don't remember"
5767540,5768120," what it is"
5768120,5768860," so listen"
5768860,5771100," backlog"
5771100,5772220," what is the backlog"
5772220,5774500," defines a maximum length"
5774500,5774880," to which"
5774880,5775180," oh"
5775180,5776060," basically the size"
5776060,5776500," of the queue"
5776500,5777560," so the maximum"
5777560,5778780," connections that you may have"
5778780,5779080," okay"
5779080,5780820," okay"
5780820,5781120," good"
5781120,5786300," so listen"
5786300,5787860," SOC FD"
5787860,5789140," let's define"
5789140,5790780," a constant"
5790780,5791720," maxcon"
5791720,5792120," right"
5792120,5792920," so this is how many"
5792920,5793360," of these things"
5793360,5793900," you can define"
5793900,5795000," and after that"
5795000,5795480," we can do"
5795480,5796520," cmp reg 0"
5796520,5797380," if it failed"
5797380,5798020," we just do"
5798020,5799020," gl error"
5799020,5800620," so we can also"
5800620,5801420," probably want to have"
5801420,5801920," some sort of"
5801920,5802660," tracing"
5802660,5803800," so"
5803800,5806260," listen"
5806260,5807100," trace"
5807100,5809680," listen"
5809680,5810480," trace"
5810480,5813420," bind"
5813420,5814200," listen"
5814200,5815400," listening"
5815400,5815960," to"
5815960,5816620," the socket"
5816620,5818860," listening"
5818860,5819620," to"
5819620,5820740," le socket"
5820740,5821680," listening"
5821680,5822080," to"
5822080,5822760," le socket"
5822760,5824400," so"
5824400,5825640," and in our case"
5825640,5826780," this is actually"
5826780,5827660," syscall"
5827660,5828240," 2"
5828240,5829080," listening"
5829080,5829700," accepts"
5829700,5830440," two parameters"
5830440,5831300," so let's actually"
5831300,5832480," just do something"
5832480,5833400," like this"
5833400,5834920," and"
5834920,5836760," yeah"
5836760,5838040," I want to"
5838040,5838740," use the"
5838740,5839280," exact"
5839280,5839760," naming"
5839760,5840220," in here"
5840220,5842180," then"
5842180,5842720," macro"
5842720,5843480," listen"
5843480,5845020," SOC FD"
5845020,5846200," backlog"
5846200,5849520," syscall"
5849520,5849960," 2"
5849960,5851640," SOC FD"
5851640,5852600," backlog"
5852600,5856700," there we go"
5856700,5857360," and"
5857360,5857880," that"
5857880,5858460," should be"
5858460,5858660," well"
5858660,5859000," I mean"
5859000,5860240," SOC 2"
5860240,5861020," probably"
5861020,5861840," has to"
5861840,5862360," accept"
5862360,5862760," the"
5862760,5863780," idea"
5863780,5864240," of the"
5864240,5864480," sys"
5864480,5864880," listen"
5864880,5865640," right"
5865640,5866300," so we have to"
5866300,5866840," define this"
5866840,5867040," thing"
5867040,5867700," somewhere here"
5867700,5868940," and we're"
5868940,5869100," going to"
5869100,5869460," put this"
5869460,5869740," thing"
5869740,5870040," here"
5870040,5870480," equal"
5870480,5871660," and what"
5871660,5872200," is it"
5872200,5872740," equal"
5872740,5873340," mine"
5873340,5874420," in there"
5874420,5876200," 50"
5876200,5876720," okay"
5876720,5878260," so this is 50"
5878260,5879460," goes right"
5879460,5879920," after the"
5879920,5880180," byte"
5880180,5883420," okay"
5883420,5883440," okay"
5883440,5883920," so let's"
5883920,5884180," try to"
5884180,5884480," build this"
5884480,5884680," entire"
5884680,5884980," thing"
5884980,5885340," and"
5885340,5885780," illegal"
5885780,5886280," instruction"
5886280,5886940," so we"
5886940,5887260," don't have"
5887260,5887740," clause"
5887740,5888800," oh okay"
5888800,5889280," so I forgot"
5889280,5889840," to actually"
5889840,5890320," define"
5890320,5890740," clause"
5890740,5892260," let's go"
5892260,5892620," ahead and"
5892620,5892900," define"
5892900,5893720," so maybe"
5893720,5894100," I'm going to"
5894100,5894480," actually"
5894480,5895500," collect all"

5896880,5897520," right"
5897520,5897860," I'm going to"

5898920,5899260," macros"
5899260,5899620," I'm going to"
5899620,5899920," put them"
5899920,5900300," in here"

5902320,5903640," clause"

5916420,5917100," is"
5917100,5917840," essentially"
5917840,5919180," I don't"
5919180,5919720," know if"

5923580,5924080," macros"
5924080,5924640," without"
5924640,5925220," repetition"
5925220,5926820," so"
5926820,5927640," but since"
5927640,5927960," I don't"
5927960,5928380," know that"
5928380,5928580," way"
5928580,5928900," I'm just"
5928900,5929260," repeating"
5929260,5929520," it"
5929520,5930020," as soon"
5930020,5930240," as I"
5930240,5930700," discover"
5930700,5931000," that"
5931000,5931260," way"
5931260,5932020," I"
5932020,5932280," probably"
5932280,5932500," will"
5932500,5932840," get rid"
5932840,5932940," of"
5932940,5933040," the"
5933040,5933440," repetition"
5933440,5934260," right"
5934260,5934780," I'll probably"
5934780,5935200," get rid of"
5935200,5935380," that"
5935380,5936600," so max"

5937000,5937400," is not"
5937400,5937740," defined"
5937740,5938160," so let's"
5938160,5938680," define them"
5938680,5939160," somehow"
5939160,5940540," we're going to"
5940540,5941020," have max"
5941020,5941460," connections"
5941460,5942100," so how many"
5942100,5942440," connections"
5942440,5942860," we want to"
5942860,5943000," have"
5943000,5943340," let's say"
5943340,5943620," we're going to"
5943620,5944060," have five"
5944060,5944540," connections"
5944540,5945540," so q"
5945540,5945980," of five"
5945980,5946500," connections"
5946500,5947680," so sys"
5947680,5948000," close"
5948000,5948420," is not"
5948420,5948820," defined"
5948820,5949360," so as you"
5949360,5949560," can see"
5949560,5949880," I can't"
5949880,5950360," even use"
5950360,5950880," compiler"
5950880,5951240," assisted"
5951240,5951840," refactoring"
5951840,5952180," here"
5952180,5952440," right"
5952440,5952720," so I"
5952720,5953080," can just"
5953080,5953720," use a bunch"
5953720,5954120," of things"
5954120,5955100," and"
5955100,5956220," right"
5956220,5956560," just go"
5956560,5956800," through the"
5956800,5957420," compilation errors"
5957420,5958740," close"
5958740,5959820," and the"
5959820,5960160," close"
5960160,5960660," is actually"
5960660,5961000," three"
5961000,5961740," people are"
5961740,5961960," having"
5961960,5963200," port flashbacks"
5963200,5963440," yeah"
5963440,5964020," because that's"
5964020,5964660," what port is"
5964660,5965160," it's just a"
5965160,5965800," preprocessor for"
5965800,5966120," assembly"
5966120,5966540," that's what"
5966540,5966900," it was"
5966900,5968300," and"
5968300,5968880," yeah"
5968880,5975880," all right"
5975880,5978580," and compiles"
5978580,5979760," and the whole"
5979760,5980180," thing is"
5980180,5981380," 716 bytes"
5981380,5982940," 716 bytes"
5982940,5983960," so"
5983960,5985560," let's"
5985560,5986460," just try to"
5986460,5986780," run"
5986780,5987420," this entire"
5987420,5987680," thing"
5987680,5988160," and see"
5988160,5988520," what it"
5988520,5988680," says"
5988680,5988960," okay"
5988960,5989660," so we"
5989660,5990140," successfully"
5990140,5991080," listened to"
5991080,5991560," the socket"
5991560,5993300," we successfully"
5993300,5993940," listened to"
5993940,5994360," the socket"
5994360,5995360," and the last"
5995360,5996020," operation that"
5996020,5996520," we have to"
5996520,5996940," perform"
5996940,5997620," the last"
5997620,5998160," operation that"
5998160,5998500," we have to"
5998500,5998720," perform"
5998720,5999600," we have to"
5999600,6000300," accept"
6000300,6001500," the socket"
6001500,6001960," we have to"
6001960,6002360," accept the"
6002360,6002580," socket"
6002580,6003100," but"
6003100,6004000," interesting"
6004000,6004400," thing"
6004400,6005320," is that"
6005320,6006760," accepting"
6006760,6007540," will block"
6007540,6008100," right"
6008100,6008520," accepting"
6008520,6009000," will block"
6009000,6009380," and will"
6009380,6010040," wait for"
6010040,6010680," until we"
6010680,6010980," get a"
6010980,6011400," connection"
6011400,6012120," and we'll"
6012120,6012460," have to"
6012460,6012980," react to"
6012980,6013140," that"
6013140,6013540," connection"
6013540,6015240," by writing"
6015240,6015680," into the"
6015680,6015860," file"
6015860,6016340," descriptor"
6016340,6016660," that we"
6016660,6016980," got"
6016980,6019420," so let's"
6019420,6019980," try to"
6019980,6020280," see that"
6020280,6020580," so let's"
6020580,6020880," take a look"
6020880,6021080," at the"
6021080,6021440," definition"
6021440,6021680," of"
6021680,6022080," accept"
6022080,6022540," so what"
6022540,6022700," is"
6022700,6023320," accept"
6023320,6025500," accept"
6025500,6027860," socket"
6027860,6027880," socket"
6027880,6028860," of the"
6028860,6029180," server"
6029180,6030120," and it"
6030120,6030340," also"
6030340,6030680," accepts"
6030680,6030860," the"
6030860,6031120," pointer"
6031120,6031340," of"
6031340,6031640," socket"
6031640,6032100," address"
6032100,6032300," the"
6032300,6032540," one"
6032540,6032840," socket"
6032840,6033240," address"
6033240,6033460," that"
6033460,6033620," will"
6033620,6033860," already"
6033860,6034160," work"
6034160,6034540," before"
6034540,6036220," but this"
6036220,6037300," time it's a separate"
6037300,6038200," socket address"
6038200,6040300," structure that is going to"
6040300,6042220," be filled up with"
6042220,6043600," information about the"
6043600,6044560," client that just"
6044560,6045240," connected"
6045240,6046040," right"
6046040,6048080," so we filled up the"
6048080,6048760," socket address"
6048760,6049900," specifically for the"
6049900,6050160," server"
6050160,6050780," this is the"
6050780,6051480," server information"
6051480,6052400," and we need to"
6052400,6052900," allocate the"
6052900,6053220," second"
6053220,6053780," structure"
6053780,6054100," socket"
6054100,6054300," address"
6054300,6054680," structure"
6054680,6055540," that is going to be"
6055540,6056760," filled up about the"
6056760,6057860," client information"
6057860,6059320," so we need two of"
6059320,6060040," these structures"
6060040,6061100," we need two of"
6061100,6061600," these structures"
6061600,6063240," and this is probably"
6063240,6064080," where the"
6064080,6064520," struct"
6064520,6065480," macro is going to"
6065480,6065940," be useful"
6065940,6067640," so probably"
6067640,6068580," I'm going to"
6068580,6069720," try to use it"
6069720,6070380," right now"
6070380,6071040," I have a feeling"
6071040,6071560," that I want to"
6071560,6072260," use it right now"
6072260,6075080," so let me"
6075080,6076140," let me try"
6076140,6076840," to see"
6076840,6078900," let me try"
6078900,6079400," to see"
6079400,6080980," so"
6080980,6082180," if I"
6082180,6083180," remember correctly"
6083180,6084140," so I need to"
6084140,6085120," find"
6085120,6087180," where we talked"
6087180,6087800," about it"
6087800,6089220," yeah here it is"
6089220,6090040," so you define the"
6090040,6090400," structure"
6090400,6092420," then you can define"
6092420,6093380," my point and"
6093380,6093860," stuff like that"
6093860,6094440," so let's go ahead"
6094440,6094960," and do that"
6094960,6098600," so this is"
6098600,6098980," this"
6098980,6100360," it did a really"
6100360,6100900," weird thing"
6100900,6101220," I don't know"
6101220,6101680," what it did"
6101680,6105720," so we need to"
6105720,6106660," have these four"
6106660,6107520," fields in here"
6107520,6108100," to be fair"
6108100,6108800," I can just like"
6108800,6110020," grab these fields"
6110020,6111420," and that's"
6111420,6111820," what it's going"
6111820,6112080," to be"
6112080,6112840," so we're not"
6112840,6113280," going to accept"
6113280,6113880," any parameters"
6113880,6114780," so structures"
6114780,6115420," in here"
6115420,6116160," can accept"
6116160,6116900," compile time"
6116900,6117320," parameters"
6117320,6117820," making them"
6117820,6118280," generics"
6118280,6118680," actually"
6118680,6120300," right so"
6120300,6121000," it makes them"
6121000,6121480," generics"
6121480,6122720," and in here"
6122720,6123360," what we have"
6123360,6123740," to do"
6123740,6124340," is just"
6124340,6125140," something like"
6125140,6125480," this"
6125480,6126420," right"
6126420,6127120," so"
6127120,6128140," and this is"
6128140,6128780," more of a"
6128780,6129220," server"
6129220,6130120," addr"
6130120,6130220," addr"
6130220,6130760," in"
6130760,6131500," so this is"
6131500,6131820," the name"
6131820,6132540," of the structure"
6132540,6134880," yep yep yep"
6134880,6135360," so the name"
6135360,6135780," of the structure"
6135780,6136440," and how we"
6136440,6136920," use that"
6136920,6138500," we use that"
6138500,6140420," like so"
6140420,6142580," we just do"
6142580,6143180," server"
6143180,6144520," addr"
6144520,6146460," so this is"
6146460,6147160," the name"
6147160,6148460," of the structure"
6148460,6149200," and then"
6149200,6150660," the definition"
6150660,6152000," of this thing"
6152000,6153140," like so"
6153140,6154460," and that"
6154460,6155380," single definition"
6155380,6156060," is supposed"
6156060,6156800," to replace"
6156800,6157980," these four"
6157980,6158500," things"
6158500,6159260," right it's"
6159260,6159660," supposed to"
6159660,6160220," replace these"
6160220,6160840," four things"
6160840,6161660," I wonder if"
6161660,6162180," there's a way"
6162180,6162660," to just"
6162660,6164360," take the size"
6164360,6164920," of this entire"
6164920,6165360," structure"
6165360,6167100," but I don't"
6167100,6167600," really know"
6167600,6168320," how easy"
6168320,6168740," it is to"
6168740,6169540," find it"
6169540,6170340," so there's"
6170340,6170960," also another"
6170960,6172000," like restruct"
6172000,6172540," thingy"
6172540,6173940," so defining"
6173940,6174480," data structure"
6174480,6175160," addresses by"
6175160,6175720," register or"
6175720,6176460," absolute value"
6176460,6177140," blah blah blah"
6177140,6178280," so micro"
6178280,6178800," instructions"
6178800,6179820," see that"
6179820,6181020," yeah"
6181020,6181880," so there's"
6181880,6182440," there's a lot"
6182440,6183140," of ways to"
6183140,6184140," define structure"
6184140,6185600," so I don't"
6185600,6186540," know like all"
6186540,6186880," of them"
6186880,6187960," it would be"
6187960,6188600," really it would"
6188600,6189140," be really kind"
6189140,6189600," of cool if"
6189600,6190000," there was a"
6190000,6190640," way to just"
6190640,6191780," take the size"
6191780,6192280," of this entire"
6192280,6192740," thing but we"
6192740,6193440," can compute it"
6193440,6194040," we can just"
6194040,6194520," like easily"
6194520,6195180," compute it"
6195180,6196920," so this"
6196920,6197820," thing should"
6197820,6198340," automatically"
6198340,6199340," create this"
6199340,6200040," symbol anyway"
6200040,6201060," so we will"
6201060,6201660," always know"
6201660,6202200," the size of"
6202200,6202720," the syntax"
6202720,6203800," maybe I'm"
6203800,6204120," going to even"
6204120,6204560," call it like"
6204560,6204940," that"
6204940,6207100," so and to"
6207100,6207660," create a"
6207660,6209020," structure for"
6209020,6209620," the server"
6209620,6210620," for the client"
6210620,6211060," I think we"
6211060,6211420," want to do"
6211420,6211820," something like"
6211820,6212840," CLI HDR"
6212840,6214680," of the type"
6214680,6215020," serve"
6215020,6215860," HDR in"
6215860,6217700," so that way"
6217700,6218400," we have two"
6218400,6219080," structures"
6219080,6220660," of the same"
6220660,6221160," layout"
6221160,6221680," right"
6221680,6223700," so that's"
6223700,6224220," pretty cool"
6224220,6227340," size is"
6227340,6228000," mentioned in"
6228000,6228580," that paragraph"
6228580,6231140," so size"
6231140,6233500," yeah okay"
6233500,6234120," I can see"
6234120,6234840," so you can"
6234840,6235500," automatically"
6235500,6236180," sort of"
6236180,6238020," yeah I don't"
6238020,6238660," like that"
6238660,6239600," you have to"
6239600,6240800," I'm going to"
6240800,6241340," define two"
6241340,6241740," structures"
6241740,6242220," I can do"
6242220,6242720," something like"
6242720,6243040," this"
6243040,6243640," right so I"
6243640,6243960," can say"
6243960,6244940," size is"
6244940,6245720," equal to"
6245720,6247240," maybe"
6247240,6248080," sin"
6248080,6248660," family"
6248660,6250800," right the"
6250800,6251020," beginning"
6251020,6251780," minus that"
6251780,6252900," I can try"
6252900,6253200," to do"
6253200,6253640," something like"
6253640,6253880," this"
6253880,6254380," but that"
6254380,6254800," means I'm"
6254800,6255000," going to"
6255000,6255860," have an"
6255860,6256560," instance of"
6256560,6256960," the size"
6256960,6257560," for each"
6257560,6258080," individual"
6258080,6258540," same"
6258540,6259100," structure"
6259100,6259980," but maybe"
6259980,6260600," that's fine"
6260600,6261780," maybe that's"
6261780,6262080," fine"
6262080,6263960," so it's a"
6263960,6264200," little bit"
6264200,6264520," annoying"
6264520,6265080," I don't"
6265080,6265540," know why"
6265540,6267120," but I guess"
6267120,6267780," that's fine"
6267780,6271820," so that means"
6271820,6272320," serve"
6272320,6273060," ADDR"
6273060,6273720," there will be"
6273720,6274160," size"
6274160,6275540," yeah"
6275540,6278100," okay"
6278100,6279860," so let me"
6279860,6280540," try to recompile"
6280540,6281080," this entire thing"
6281080,6281640," so we'll have to"
6281640,6282040," go through the"
6282040,6283020," compilation errors"
6283020,6284600," and see how"
6284600,6285000," it's going to"
6285000,6285260," go"
6285260,6287140," so undefined"
6287140,6288160," okay"
6288160,6290560," it's"
6290560,6291340," four"
6291340,6293480," so this means"
6293480,6294160," that this thing"
6294160,6294840," has to be just"
6294840,6295220," size"
6295220,6296580," and it worked"
6296580,6297180," okay so it"
6297180,6297820," worked actually"
6297820,6298580," exactly as I"
6298580,6299460," expected it"
6299460,6300720," that's funny"
6300720,6303580," that is funny"
6303580,6305080," okay that's"
6305080,6305580," actually super"
6305580,6305840," cool"
6305840,6306660," all right"
6306660,6310680," so size"
6310680,6312500," would dot size"
6312500,6313200," not be compile"
6313200,6313780," time only"
6313780,6314280," it would"
6314280,6314880," but I mean"
6314880,6315380," that's not the"
6315380,6315860," problem that I"
6315860,6316080," have"
6316080,6317780," all right"
6317780,6318400," so let's try"
6318400,6318900," to run it"
6318900,6319620," and it"
6319620,6320080," errored"
6320080,6322920," so it"
6322920,6323440," literally"
6323440,6323900," errored"
6323900,6324840," and I wonder"
6324840,6325600," what caused"
6325600,6325980," that"
6325980,6326520," so what if"
6326520,6327360," I go back"
6327360,6328440," in what I"
6328440,6329220," just created"
6329220,6330460," so I need"
6330460,6330880," to I really"
6330880,6331300," need to go"
6331300,6331660," back"
6331660,6334060," and get rid"
6334060,6334340," of this"
6334340,6334960," entire thing"
6334960,6336960," yeah"
6336960,6337880," I'm getting"
6337880,6338380," rid of this"
6338380,6338920," entire thing"
6338920,6339260," and I'm"
6339260,6339460," going to"
6339460,6340060," try to"
6340060,6341040," recompile"
6341040,6341520," this entire"
6341520,6341860," stuff"
6341860,6342980," and it"
6342980,6343540," doesn't"
6343540,6343840," error"
6343840,6344600," so it"
6344600,6344940," doesn't"
6344940,6345240," work"
6345240,6345700," exactly"
6345700,6346080," as I"
6346080,6346500," expected"
6346500,6346980," to work"
6346980,6347540," unfortunately"
6347540,6348040," so"
6348040,6352220," we're not"
6352220,6352840," going to"
6352840,6353860," go that"
6353860,6354220," route"
6354220,6354520," then"
6354520,6354960," and we're"
6354960,6355200," not going"
6355200,6355380," to go"
6355380,6355900," that route"
6355900,6358380," so what"
6358380,6358700," I want"
6358700,6358960," to do"
6358960,6359420," probably"
6359420,6360360," is just"
6360360,6360800," to try"
6360800,6361120," to do"
6361120,6361240," it"
6361240,6361420," like"
6361420,6361800," that"
6361800,6364420," serve"
6364420,6365480," addr"
6365480,6365980," in"
6365980,6366920," let's try"
6366920,6367660," to recompile"
6367660,6368520," this entire thing"
6368520,6369660," and run it"
6369660,6370540," and it works"
6370540,6370800," okay"
6370800,6371280," so there is"
6371280,6371820," something wrong"
6371820,6372160," with that"
6372160,6372980," specific size"
6372980,6373240," thing"
6373240,6375740," so yeah"
6375740,6376360," it didn't work"
6376360,6376700," the way"
6376700,6377220," I expected"
6377220,6377500," this"
6377500,6382600," so but"
6382600,6383160," that's fine"
6383160,6383840," that's actually"
6383840,6384160," fine"
6384160,6384540," we can"
6384540,6385280," just do"
6385280,6387400," serve"
6387400,6388040," addr"
6388040,6388880," cli"
6388880,6389460," addr"
6389460,6391800," so let's"
6391800,6393220," run and"
6393220,6393760," compile it"
6393760,6394260," simultaneously"
6394260,6394980," compile and"
6394980,6395280," run it"
6395280,6395720," simultaneously"
6395720,6397400," so and that"
6397400,6397940," seems to be"
6397940,6398340," working"
6398340,6399400," okay"
6399400,6400820," so now"
6400820,6401660," what I need"
6401660,6401940," to do"
6401940,6402220," I need"
6402220,6402480," to do"
6402480,6403080," accept"
6403080,6403980," I need"
6403980,6404280," to do"
6404280,6404960," accept"
6404960,6410300," so let"
6410300,6410580," me"
6410580,6411260," take a look"
6411260,6411480," at the"
6411480,6411920," accept"
6411920,6414560," it's"
6414560,6414920," accept"
6414920,6415360," for"
6415360,6416740," so we"
6416740,6416880," need"
6416880,6417060," this"
6417060,6417400," specific"
6417400,6417860," accept"
6417860,6419340," so it"
6419340,6419820," accepts"
6419820,6420400," socfd"
6420400,6420820," all right"
6420820,6421060," so we"
6421060,6421400," can provide"
6421400,6421880," socfd"
6421880,6422800," so the"
6422800,6423120," next thing"
6423120,6423400," we have"
6423400,6423840," to provide"
6423840,6424120," we have"
6424120,6424420," to provide"
6424420,6424840," the pointer"
6424840,6425680," to the"
6425680,6426240," address"
6426240,6426760," so this"
6426760,6427040," is going"
6427040,6427300," to be"
6427300,6428260," cli"
6428260,6429100," address"
6429100,6430280," and it's"
6430280,6430760," suppose we're"
6430760,6430900," going to"
6430900,6431300," just give"
6431300,6431640," the pointer"
6431640,6431920," to"
6431920,6432320," scene"
6432320,6432780," family"
6432780,6433200," right"
6433200,6433520," so because"
6433520,6433880," this is"
6433880,6434260," where the"
6434260,6434620," structure"
6434620,6435000," starts"
6435000,6436120," and here's"
6436120,6436440," an interesting"
6436440,6436700," thing"
6436700,6437040," we have"
6437040,6437380," to provide"
6437380,6438060," the length"
6438060,6439080," as a"
6439080,6439440," pointer"
6439440,6440440," we have"
6440440,6440740," to provide"
6440740,6441120," the length"
6441120,6441400," as a"
6441400,6441680," pointer"
6441680,6442940," and furthermore"
6442940,6443320," if we take"
6443320,6443580," a look at"
6443580,6444040," the example"
6444040,6444940," in a reputable"
6444940,6445700," website called"
6445700,6446280," geeks4geeks"
6446280,6448540," so we"
6448540,6449460," also set"
6449460,6450200," the size"
6450200,6450520," of the"
6450520,6450920," structure"
6450920,6451720," to this"
6451720,6452320," specific"
6452320,6452680," variable"
6452680,6453020," that we"
6453020,6453260," provide"
6453260,6453500," as a"
6453500,6453700," pointer"
6453700,6454740," so that"
6454740,6455080," means we"
6455080,6455440," need to"
6455440,6456280," allocate"
6456280,6456920," that"
6456920,6457420," variable"
6457420,6458180," somewhere"
6458180,6459560," right"
6459560,6459880," so we"
6459880,6460060," can"
6460060,6460560," just do"
6460560,6460820," something"
6460820,6461040," like"
6461040,6461560," cli"
6461560,6462400," addr"
6462400,6463020," len"
6463020,6464400," the type"
6464400,6464740," of this"
6464740,6464960," thing"
6464960,6465380," is an"
6465380,6465700," integer"
6465700,6466040," right"
6466040,6466380," so the"
6466380,6466660," type"
6466660,6467760," I think"
6467760,6468140," it is an"
6468140,6468380," integer"
6468380,6468800," so what"
6468800,6469040," is a"
6469040,6469520," socklen"
6469520,6470960," fuck"
6470960,6471400," what is"
6471400,6471560," this"
6471560,6471960," socklen"
6471960,6474880," let's"
6474880,6475140," so I'm"
6475140,6475300," gonna"
6475300,6477080," so let's"
6477080,6477360," go to"
6477360,6477720," musil"
6477720,6478220," this is"
6478220,6478440," actually"
6478440,6478680," very"
6478680,6479060," important"
6479060,6479560," this is"
6479560,6479760," actually"
6479760,6479980," very"
6479980,6480240," important"
6480240,6480580," because"
6480580,6481440," if it's"
6481440,6482360," not the"
6482360,6482600," size"
6482600,6483000," I think"
6483000,6483380," it is"
6483380,6484260," we may"
6484260,6484480," have"
6484480,6484660," some"
6484660,6484820," sort"
6484820,6485000," of a"
6485000,6485200," buffer"
6485200,6485820," overflow"
6485820,6487460," type"
6487460,6487720," def"
6487720,6488120," so here"
6488120,6488460," it is"
6488460,6488980," it's"
6488980,6489400," unsigned"
6489400,6490280," it's just"
6490280,6490900," unsigned"
6490900,6491920," which means"
6491920,6492400," probably"
6492400,6493000," unsigned"
6493000,6493380," int"
6493380,6494200," which probably"
6494200,6494560," means"
6494560,6495300," four bytes"
6495300,6496080," right"
6496080,6496420," so which"
6496420,6496860," probably means"
6496860,6497300," four bytes"
6497300,6497600," okay"
6497600,6499220," so that"
6499220,6499560," means"
6499560,6500040," we're gonna"
6500040,6500460," say"
6500460,6501040," d"
6501040,6501560," d"
6501560,6502200," and it's"
6502200,6502480," gonna be"
6502480,6502800," zero"
6502800,6503340," right"
6503340,6503800," d d"
6503800,6504060," zero"
6504060,6504920," but maybe"
6504920,6505260," we can"
6505260,6505880," go even"
6505880,6506180," further"
6506180,6507080," and just"
6507080,6508020," put this"
6508020,6508400," thing"
6508400,6509040," because I"
6509040,6509300," suppose"
6509300,6509860," this is a"
6509860,6510480," compile time"
6510480,6510780," thing"
6510780,6511280," right"
6511280,6511680," this is a"
6511680,6512180," compile time"
6512180,6512400," thing"
6512400,6512720," and it's"
6512720,6513060," gonna like"
6513060,6513400," literally"
6513400,6513940," put it"
6513940,6514820," as data"
6514820,6515340," in there"
6515340,6517440," that's"
6517440,6517700," actually"
6517700,6518080," a five"
6518080,6518460," head move"
6518460,6518720," in my"
6518720,6518980," opinion"
6518980,6519900," this is a"
6519900,6520100," huge"
6520100,6520700," five head"
6520700,6520960," move"
6520960,6521600," right"
6521600,6522100," so because"
6522100,6522560," we know"
6522560,6522940," the size"
6522940,6523260," of this"
6523260,6523420," thing"
6523420,6523820," at compile"
6523820,6524080," time"
6524080,6524340," so we"
6524340,6524640," can just"
6524640,6525240," initialize"
6525240,6525480," it in"
6525480,6525700," memory"
6525700,6526120," like that"
6526120,6526420," okay"
6526420,6528620," so let's"
6528620,6528960," put this"
6528960,6529240," thing in"
6529240,6529400," here"
6529400,6529820," like that"
6529820,6530260," and that's"
6530260,6530760," the pointer"
6530760,6531680," basically"
6531680,6532860," and of course"
6532860,6533480," it can fail"
6533480,6534220," so we need"
6534220,6534620," to double"
6534620,6535100," check"
6535100,6536180," and also"
6536180,6536760," we wanna"
6536760,6537580," you know"
6537580,6539780," accept"
6539780,6540320," message"
6540320,6540980," accept"
6540980,6543180," so in case"
6543180,6543560," of accept"
6543560,6543860," message"
6543860,6544160," what we're"
6544160,6544640," gonna say"
6544640,6545200," what we're"
6545200,6545720," gonna say"
6545720,6547100," query"
6547100,6547720," listen"
6547720,6548760," accept"
6548760,6550100," there we"
6550100,6550340," go"
6550340,6552200," so"
6552200,6553680," waiting"
6553680,6554400," for"
6554400,6555140," client"
6555140,6556320," connections"
6556320,6557320," yeah"
6557320,6557900," waiting"
6557900,6558100," for"
6558100,6558320," client"
6558320,6558720," connections"
6558720,6559000," okay"
6559000,6559540," so"
6559540,6560240," I outlined"
6560240,6561140," the thing"
6561140,6561740," that I wanted"
6561740,6562040," to do"
6562040,6563000," I just outlined"
6563000,6563360," the thing"
6563360,6564080," so let's go ahead"
6564080,6564620," and try"
6564620,6565140," go to the"
6565140,6565840," compilation errors"
6565840,6567240," so illegal"
6567240,6567820," instruction"
6567820,6568460," accept"
6568460,6568760," right"
6568760,6569180," so we do"
6569180,6569580," not have"
6569580,6570000," accept"
6570000,6570700," which is"
6570700,6571160," fine"
6571160,6571720," which is"
6571720,6572280," a rather"
6572280,6573260," expected"
6573260,6573860," thing"
6573860,6575620," right"
6575620,6576040," so we wanna"
6576040,6576320," have"
6576320,6577000," accept"
6577000,6578500," accept"
6578500,6578540," accept"
6578540,6578940," to"
6578940,6583980," all right"
6583980,6584780," so what we"
6584780,6585400," have in here"
6585400,6587300," so we have"
6587300,6588000," SOCFD"
6588000,6588720," then we have"
6588720,6589280," address"
6589280,6589880," and address"
6589880,6590380," length"
6590380,6591380," then"
6591380,6593180," we're gonna"
6593180,6593840," have that"
6593840,6595820," accept"
6595820,6597900," address"
6597900,6598720," address"
6598720,6599580," and then"
6599580,6601200," there we go"
6601200,6601700," so that should"
6601700,6602000," define"
6602000,6602600," so we also"
6602600,6603180," need to"
6603180,6604420," find"
6604420,6604940," the"
6604940,6606880," ID"
6606880,6607260," of"
6607260,6608240," accept"
6608240,6609720," I don't know"
6609720,6610200," why I did it"
6610200,6610700," like that"
6610700,6612600," where is the"
6612600,6613220," ID of"
6613220,6613820," accept"
6613820,6615240," it is"
6615240,6616140," 43"
6616140,6617460," understandable"
6617460,6618840," so it's closer"
6618840,6619360," to here"
6619360,6620020," so it's even"
6620020,6620800," something like that"
6620800,6621460," so they go"
6621460,6622020," in order"
6622020,6622960," all of the"
6622960,6623920," sort of like a"
6623920,6624640," network API"
6624640,6625320," as you can see"
6625320,6626060," they're very close"
6626060,6626540," to each other"
6626540,6627820," so which makes"
6627820,6628460," it kind of"
6628460,6628820," funny"
6628820,6629880," right"
6629880,6630500," because exit"
6630500,6631520," is like 60"
6631520,6633040," I don't know"
6633040,6633460," why it is"
6633460,6633900," like that"
6633900,6634480," yeah"
6634480,6636640," so listen"
6636640,6637420," is 50"
6637420,6637620," okay"
6637620,6637860," so"
6637860,6641040," so let's go"
6641040,6641300," through the"
6641300,6642140," compilation errors"
6642140,6643020," one more time"
6643020,6643720," so this is gonna be"
6643720,6644120," fuzzin"
6644120,6645220," website"
6645220,6645680," awesome"
6645680,6646940," there we go"
6646940,6647640," and it compiles"
6647640,6649280," so I'm really"
6649280,6650200," happy to"
6650200,6651480," see that"
6651480,6652220," I'm super"
6652220,6652960," happy to see"
6652960,6653240," that"
6653240,6655220," okay"
6655220,6655480," go"
6655480,6656680," so"
6656680,6657480," one of the things"
6657480,6657860," we probably"
6657860,6658460," have to do"
6658460,6658720," right"
6658720,6659500," so accept"
6659500,6660840," returns"
6660840,6661360," the"
6661360,6663640," what is it"
6663640,6663900," called"
6663900,6664300," the"
6664300,6665440," the file"
6665440,6666340," descriptor"
6666340,6666660," right"
6666660,6667200," it returns"
6667200,6667920," file descriptor"
6667920,6669200," so that means"
6669200,6669660," we need to"
6669660,6670360," allocate some"
6670360,6670860," memory to"
6670860,6671520," store that"
6671520,6672180," specific file"
6672180,6672600," descriptor"
6672600,6672940," so we're gonna"
6672940,6673360," have something"
6673360,6673900," like connection"
6673900,6674280," of D"
6674280,6675180," and it's also"
6675180,6675660," going to be"
6675660,6676920," a 64-bit"
6676920,6677500," integer"
6677500,6678220," right"
6678220,6679040," so 64-bit"
6679040,6679360," integer"
6679360,6680800," after accepting"
6680800,6681980," we just"
6681980,6682660," move"
6682660,6684580," qWord"
6684580,6686160," con"
6686160,6686620," FD"
6686620,6687900," from"
6687900,6688280," racks"
6688280,6688780," so we're"
6688780,6689340," just saving"
6689340,6689960," this specific"
6689960,6690700," thing so then"
6690700,6691280," we can use"
6691280,6691720," it later"
6691720,6692740," and one of the"
6692740,6693220," things we probably"
6693220,6693600," want to do"
6693600,6694380," maybe we want to"
6694380,6695300," just close it"
6695300,6696640," when we finalize"
6696640,6697040," everything"
6697040,6697460," right"
6697460,6697760," so"
6697760,6699420," we write"
6699420,6699860," okay"
6699860,6700760," then we close"
6700760,6701400," both of these"
6701400,6701700," things"
6701700,6702840," and in case of an"
6702840,6703320," error we're gonna"
6703320,6704120," also close"
6704120,6704680," both of these"
6704680,6705000," things"
6705000,6706300," con FD"
6706300,6706920," for a long"
6706920,6707460," time is gonna"
6707460,6708200," be invalid"
6708200,6708620," thing"
6708620,6709540," but again"
6709540,6710580," we don't"
6710580,6711280," really care"
6711280,6713020," we really"
6713020,6714120," don't"
6714120,6714980," one of the"
6714980,6715480," things we can"
6715480,6715900," do by the"
6715900,6716100," way"
6716100,6716920," we can"
6716920,6717460," make them"
6717460,6718680," minus one"
6718680,6719240," or something"
6719240,6719900," you know"
6719900,6720140," why"
6720140,6721440," because zero"
6721440,6722600," is a valid"
6722600,6723340," ID"
6723340,6724680," so that means"
6724680,6726060," if it will try"
6726060,6726620," to close"
6726620,6727060," zero"
6727060,6728140," it will close"
6728140,6728540," the standard"
6728540,6729020," output"
6729020,6730680," which is"
6730680,6731520," not particularly"
6731520,6732020," a great idea"
6732020,6732400," I think"
6732400,6733120," right"
6733120,6733860," so let's"
6733860,6734400," not close"
6734400,6734560," it"
6734560,6735200," let's try to"
6735200,6735820," close something"
6735820,6736300," completely"
6736300,6736960," fucking invalid"
6736960,6737600," so it doesn't"
6737600,6738280," screw everything"
6738280,6738620," up"
6738620,6739400," you know"
6739400,6739700," what I mean"
6739700,6740420," right"
6740420,6741040," so both of them"
6741040,6741860," initially can be"
6741860,6742300," you know"
6742300,6743000," something completely"
6743000,6743320," invalid"
6743320,6746060," right"
6746060,6747580," so"
6747580,6748400," and that seems"
6748400,6749360," to be working"
6749360,6749940," that seems"
6749940,6750620," to be twerking"
6750620,6751040," all right"
6751040,6752220," so now"
6752220,6753340," if I try to"
6753340,6753660," compile"
6753660,6754180," it seems"
6754180,6754780," to be compiling"
6754780,6755880," so let's"
6755880,6756420," go ahead"
6756420,6757140," and try"
6757140,6757600," to"
6757600,6758680," okay"
6758680,6760080," it blocked"
6760080,6761780," it didn't"
6761780,6762140," print"
6762140,6762620," okay"
6762620,6763220," that means"
6763220,6763760," the entire"
6763760,6764180," call"
6764180,6765040," blocked"
6765040,6766080," it is"
6766080,6766460," waiting"
6766460,6766820," for"
6766820,6767300," incoming"
6767300,6768020," connections"
6768020,6770260," all right"
6770260,6771380," so"
6771380,6771980," and let's"
6771980,6772520," just go ahead"
6772520,6773000," and try"
6773000,6773620," to do that"
6773620,6773980," can I"
6773980,6774640," can I do"
6774640,6775020," that a little"
6775020,6775600," bit better"
6775600,6776720," so we can"
6776720,6777160," see what is"
6777160,6777700," going on"
6777700,6779240," so we can"
6779240,6779700," try to do"
6779700,6780420," telnets"
6780420,6782540," 27"
6782540,6784020," 001"
6784020,6785380," 69 69"
6785380,6792200," we successfully"
6792200,6792960," accept"
6792960,6793720," the connection"
6793720,6794280," and the"
6794280,6794500," server"
6794500,6794940," actually"
6794940,6795460," closed"
6795460,6796440," that specific"
6796440,6797000," connection"
6797000,6798380," all of"
6798380,6798700," that"
6798700,6799600," entirely"
6799600,6800240," in"
6800240,6801200," fosm"
6801200,6802140," using"
6802140,6802600," linux"
6802600,6803360," syscalls"
6803360,6804520," x86"
6804520,6805680," 69"
6805680,6806740," syscalls"
6806740,6809620," all right"
6809620,6810140," so"
6810140,6811060," yes"
6811060,6811540," yes"
6811540,6811820," yes"
6811820,6812380," but here's"
6812380,6812620," the cool"
6812620,6812920," thing"
6812920,6813560," so we have"
6813560,6813840," a con"
6813840,6814140," of d"
6814140,6814620," right"
6814620,6816100," and this"
6816100,6816480," is a file"
6816480,6817020," descriptor"
6817020,6817700," so that"
6817700,6818140," means we"
6818140,6818740," can write"
6818740,6819660," some shit"
6819660,6820100," into that"
6820100,6820340," file"
6820340,6820820," descriptor"
6820820,6821620," for example"
6821620,6822100," we can"
6822100,6822840," write a"
6822840,6823020," hello"
6823020,6823340," message"
6823340,6824160," and we"
6824160,6824700," already have"
6824700,6825080," a write"
6825080,6825580," syscall"
6825580,6826200," so we"
6826200,6826460," can do"
6826460,6826940," write"
6826940,6828240," not"
6828240,6828800," std"
6828800,6829280," out"
6829280,6830120," but"
6830120,6830560," con"
6830560,6831040," fd"
6831040,6833100," and we"
6833100,6833500," can have"
6833500,6833960," hello"
6833960,6834780," hello"
6834780,6835180," len"
6835180,6838480," so who"
6838480,6838860," said we"
6838860,6839280," can't do"
6839280,6839640," shit like"
6839640,6839880," that"
6839880,6840240," we can"
6840240,6840380," do"
6840380,6840740," shit like"
6840740,6840900," that"
6840900,6841140," so let's"
6841140,6841420," go ahead"
6841420,6841640," and do"
6841640,6841860," that"
6841860,6843240," so maybe"
6843240,6843440," we're going"
6843440,6843660," to have"
6843660,6844120," something like"
6844120,6844480," hello"
6844480,6846040," hello"
6846040,6846880," from"
6846880,6849260," fosm"
6849260,6849740," maybe"
6849740,6850260," flat"
6850260,6852220," assembler"
6852220,6853900," so maybe"
6853900,6854140," we're going"
6854140,6854420," to provide"
6854420,6854660," a new"
6854660,6854800," line"
6854800,6855100," let's"
6855100,6855320," provide"
6855320,6855560," a new"
6855560,6855760," line"
6855760,6856560," hello"
6856560,6857140," len"
6857140,6857740," equal"
6857740,6858900," minus"
6858900,6859280," hello"
6859280,6859940," there we go"
6859940,6860960," so let's try"
6860960,6861820," to compile"
6861820,6862160," this into"
6862160,6862460," I think"
6862460,6862840," a legal"
6862840,6863360," instruction"
6863360,6864400," hello"
6864400,6864680," yeah"
6864680,6865220," because this"
6865220,6865640," has to be"
6865640,6865940," db"
6865940,6867360," so that"
6867360,6867700," seems to"
6867700,6868080," be working"
6868080,6868640," that seems"
6868640,6869020," to be"
6869020,6870160," twerking"
6870160,6870940," okay"
6870940,6871340," so we're"
6871340,6871920," waiting for"
6871920,6872340," incoming"
6872340,6873000," connections"
6873000,6874920," so I'm"
6874920,6875140," going to"
6875140,6875520," close a"
6875520,6875860," bunch of"

7025740,7025960," that"
7025960,7026240," right"

7308260,7308840," you have"
7308840,7309660," on software"
7309660,7310500," if this"

7327080,7327440," needed"
7327440,7328760," right"
7328760,7329120," so"
7329120,7329520," it's just"
7329520,7329800," like"
7329800,7330260," yeah"
7330260,7331280," so"
7331280,7332320," this"
7332320,7332560," thing"
7332560,7332760," is"

7333160,7333440," static"
7333440,7333880," even if"
7333880,7334380," like"
7334380,7335120," what's funny"
7335120,7335360," is that"
7335360,7335860," if I give"
7335860,7336140," you this"
7336140,7336720," executable"
7336720,7338100," and you"

7338480,7339260," 64-bit"
7339260,7339640," linux"
7339640,7340780," it will"
7340780,7340780," it will"
7340780,7341080," just"
7341080,7341440," work"
7341440,7341720," on your"

7342060,7343780," without"
7343780,7344160," any"
7344160,7344400," fuzz"
7344400,7344540," you"
7344540,7344680," will"
7344680,7344860," just"
7344860,7345260," execute"
7345260,7345440," it"
7345440,7345640," and"
7345640,7345840," will"
7345840,7346000," do"
7346000,7346220," the"
7346220,7346420," same"
7346420,7346660," on your"
7346660,7346980," machine"
7346980,7348060," because"
7348060,7348500," it doesn't"
7348500,7348900," depend on"
7348900,7349300," libc"
7349300,7349940," on anything"
7349940,7350380," like that"
7350380,7350680," it's just"
7350680,7351100," like uses"
7351100,7352420," the sys calls"
7352420,7352860," of linux"
7352860,7353340," that were"
7353340,7354000," like that"
7354000,7354660," existed for"
7354660,7355160," ages"
7355160,7355660," right"
7355660,7356060," they didn't"
7356060,7356640," change much"
7356640,7357240," I think"
7357240,7357980," I think"
7357980,7358340," they didn't"
7358340,7358900," change much"
7358900,7359700," right"
7359700,7359960," so"
7359960,7360280," it will"
7360280,7360500," just"
7360500,7360940," work"
7360940,7363440," no package"
7363440,7363860," managers"
7363860,7364740," nor anything"
7364740,7365660," no dependencies"
7365660,7366180," or like"
7366180,7366500," just like"
7366500,7367460," single executable"
7367460,7369660," one kilobyte"
7369660,7370580," of machine"
7370580,7371060," instructions"
7371060,7371660," and it will"
7371660,7372160," serve like"
7372160,7372680," simple page"
7372680,7378060," I think"
7378060,7378360," that's pretty"
7378360,7378600," cool"
7378600,7379740," so"
7379740,7380240," that's very"
7380240,7380540," interesting"
7380540,7382220," it will"
7382220,7382680," be also"
7382680,7383000," kind of"
7383000,7383920," cool to"
7383920,7384800," like"
7384800,7385260," introduce"
7385260,7385740," some sort"
7385740,7386000," of a"
7386000,7386320," logic"
7386320,7386860," in here"
7386860,7387540," right"
7387540,7388520," being able"
7388520,7389620," to route"
7389620,7390380," between"
7390380,7391340," different routes"
7391340,7391620," right"
7391620,7392220," so like"
7392220,7392580," handle"
7392580,7393380," the paths"
7393380,7393840," in here"
7393840,7394340," and URLs"
7394340,7394760," and stuff"
7394760,7395020," like that"
7395020,7395340," that will"
7395340,7395640," require"
7395640,7396320," parsing"
7396320,7397200," the"
7397200,7397960," HTTP"
7397960,7398340," headers"
7398340,7398720," and whatnot"
7398720,7400540," right"
7400540,7400900," so that"
7400900,7401120," will be"
7401120,7401360," cool"
7401360,7402300," but"
7402300,7402740," we're already"
7402740,7402980," streaming"
7402980,7403420," for two"
7403420,7403700," and a half"
7403700,7404100," of an hour"
7404100,7404520," so"
7404520,7405640," yeah"
7405640,7406100," I think"
7406100,7406800," the time"
7406800,7407080," for me"
7407080,7407480," has come"
