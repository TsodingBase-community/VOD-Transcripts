0,10800," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another"
10800,22240," hello hello so uh let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start the stream so"
22240,28160," let me bring my discord server which is a little bit laggy right now uh so hello hello everyone"
28160,37520," i really got the seal so red i wanted red circle but i got red car okay so live on twitch and what"
37520,43600," are we doing today on twitch.television today we're doing game death and jay right so i still"
43600,50000," want to continue developing the jay break game uh that i started you know some time ago right"
50000,55040," this is how it looks like you can find the source code of this thing here i'm going to post it in"
55040,58640," the chat and if you're watching on youtube eventually i don't know when i'm going to"
58640,64080," publish all of that because i have a huge backlog uh you will find that in the description hopefully i"
64080,69440," don't know if i don't lose the description file right so i have a ton of description files right"
69440,77440," so maybe i'll lose something at some point who knows uh right so and let me give the link to the twitch.tv"
78400,84320," and i'm going to ping everyone who's interested in being pinged by the way the uh you know role"
84320,90880," assignment bot is actually fixed so if you go to roles and just click on pinged it will assign pinged"
90880,95440," role to you so you don't have to worry about that i should probably convert announcement channel to the"
95440,100560," announcement channel right so the discord supports that because people were coming up with their own"
100560,106960," solutions but i'm a boomer i don't know how to use discord so i'm sorry i'm also afraid that i'm going to"
106960,113360," break something and waste my time so the current system works and as an experienced programmer"
113360,119680," i know that if something works you better don't touch it hello hello everyone welcome welcome welcome"
119680,125840," so let's take a look at the game let's take a look at the game i don't think i actually was developing"
125840,132880," anything for that game off screen so i haven't streamed for like several days and uh for the whole time i was"
132880,140160," working on my bot right for the chatbot i'm currently rewriting my chatbot and go to um you know simplify"
140160,145280," maintenance because the current bot was written in haskell and haskell is a pain in the ass to maintain"
145280,152960," uh if somebody tells you otherwise they're lying they're lying because they're brainwashed by haskell"
152960,163920," propaganda so okay hello hello uh anyway so haskell is one of those languages that is developed by"
163920,169280," mathematicians but the problem with mathematicians is that they're not really great software developers"
169280,173280," they're great mathematicians but they are not great software developers which means"
173280,180480," uh haskell is a beautiful and elegant language and i'm saying that ironically it is a beautiful and elegant"
180480,186880," language that is pain in the ass to use because it's not engineered properly right so things like cabal and"
186880,192320," stack they're just like so fucking painful the packaging is painful like everything related to"
192320,199520," software part the actual software part in haskell is fucking painful but the language itself is beautiful"
199520,203600," and you can clearly see that it's created by mathematicians they're great mathematicians right"
203600,208880," so they created beautiful language but they couldn't engineer it properly so it's so frustrating"
208880,214080," because i want to use haskell i like haskell but it's just like implementations are pain in ass"
214080,228320," so uh anyway i'm sorry why do you host your bot on that laptop because i can't pay for virtual private"
228320,236400," servers so i have my own real server yes this is a this is a data center right so"
237760,242880," and this is this is this is the server and i'm not joking well the the bottom that is currently answering"
242880,247120," the the project commands it's it's sitting there uh so"
247120,258080," best data center so i also have a couple of uh routers right and i'm thinking to actually change their"
259040,267760," firmware and also connect them to to the cluster i don't know anyway so uh let's take a look at the"
267760,274000," game right so this is a jailbreak and uh i think on the previous stream we were working specifically on"
274000,281520," meta programming right so i know that people told me that there is like a built-in uh thing in jai to"
281520,287840," reload the configuration files and stuff like that but they decided to make my own one because i want to at least"
287840,293680," learn how to do meta programming and jai otherwise i won't learn anything right so and this project is"
293680,304240," for learning right so i wonder if i still have any changes um okay so let me let me see so here are the"
304240,315680," changes and yeah all right uh so let me just go ahead and try to compile that and see whatever it will tell"
315680,324240," me uh is it software i don't quite remember i think it's opt uh bin jai and i'm going to do i think i have"
324240,330720," to do first j right so because now we have a build script right i'm running a build script that then builds the"
330720,337920," actual uh you know the actual program which we then uh can run so i'm going to do j break and there you"
337920,347200," go so here is the game right so here's the game this is how it looks like uh okay so to refresh what i"
347200,353120," want you to have is i want you to have this file uh with configuration right so this is a file with"
353120,359600," configuration and i want to be able to dynamically reload that configuration as you can see currently"
359600,365120," i have a lot of configuration parameters and they're all hard coded right uh but i want to be able to"
365120,371440," reload them so i'm slowly moving them into a separate file and also have a i want to have an option that um"
372000,379040," when i'm ready to do a release i want to actually strip off anything related to hot reloading right"
379040,385920," and bake those constant constants into the uh into the final program right so and that's basically what"
385920,395920," we were working on and um here we created a simple meta program that at build time uh parses the um"
398000,404880," the param.conf and generates like everything that you need to generate in here so and it managed to"
404880,410640," generate like a constant stuff right so it's generating constant stuff but i also want to be able to"
410640,413120," have the dynamic hot reloading stuff"
413120,422320," hot reloading stuff and maybe this is what i'm going to be working on right now i think that's a very"
422320,431360," interesting idea yeah i think it's a very interesting idea so essentially uh move all of that parsing"
431360,436720," stuff into a separate module that can be reused by runtime as well yeah that's a cool thing you can"
436720,444560," reuse the same code for building and for the runtime if you want to that's actually pretty cool so i think"
444560,450160," that's what i think that's what i'm going to do i like the font you use for the game text you can find"
450160,457600," this font in uh forms folder it's called uh allegrea i hope i pronounce it it's correctly but yeah it's"
457600,463600," called the gray and it's uh under ofl so it's sort of like a free like open source license for fonts"
463600,471120," and you can find this font on github in here so uh i'm gonna actually put it in here"
472480,476320," can you do that i'm pretty sure zeke can do that i just like didn't learn how to do that"
476320,487920," uh all right so the font i use for the game right it's actually a pretty cool font"
487920,492640," specifically for the game it just like fits really really well um okay"
492640,502320," so and of course you can find that in the source code the source code of the game is open and"
502320,508480," here is the font right so it comes with the game um so all right"
508480,515200," uh so uh"
515200,521520," for rams"
521520,531200," uh a challenge starting to create their own broadcasting software like obs written in zig"
532160,541280," uh well people had to donate to me 300 just for me to check zeke because this is how much i didn't"
541280,549760," want to do that are you sure you have enough money to actually force me to write anything serious in"
549760,558640," it 300 bucks just to check it just check it just hello world 300 bucks are you sure you have enough money"
558640,562960," for obs think about that uh so"
562960,567440," uh anyway"
567440,576320," so it's not about the challenge it's just like i don't want to do that i have better things to do with"
576320,584640," my life uh okay so what i want to do right so i want to move everything related to parameter parsing"
584640,591520," um into a separate module right so i already created a file called params.j right so and let's go ahead"
591520,598000," and just like literally move everything there so first we have a param uh right so here is a param"
598000,603600," so it's a structure it contains the name and contains the value so this is the uh the types that"
603600,610800," we support right now right so we also have a simple function that accepts a line and turns it into a parameter"
610800,618320," right so it also has a boolean and stuff like that um oh by the way do you guys remember how i had a"
618320,626080," problem when i confused the order of params and boolean uh so uh jonah as far as i know he already"
626080,632160," fixed it today on the stream so this is actually super cool uh because i reported that bug to like"
632160,637600," wire email and he accepted it and he fixed it today so the next bet is gonna be fixed so cool"
637600,646160," i'm contributing to the language i'm actually contributing to the language holy shit wow um"
646160,660000," okay so uh let's continue so i'm gonna take this thing and the problem with that thing was uh i wonder if i can"
660000,670400," demonstrate that uh right so if i remember correctly so test the adj right so main something something"
670400,675840," like this so essentially if you had the structure right so let's define i don't know full right so this"
675840,684160," is a structure uh struct and if you have something that constructs that structure right and that something"
684160,691280," returns not only the structure but also like a boolean right so i think i think that sounds like a"
691280,700400," boolean and if you return it uh like so and then you make that structure so you do full okay and you do"
700400,707280," make and then you can check if not okay you want to report an error right so maybe i'm going to do that"
708560,712640," uh i keep forgetting that i don't have to put curly braces in here because i've been programming in go"
712640,718640," for the past like several uh several days so go doesn't allow you to do things like that which"
718640,724880," sometimes convenience and technically but uh jay allows you to do that so this is a failed um right"
724880,733840," and here we probably want to import basic right so it actually enables the the q basic support for the"
733840,741920," language i don't know it doesn't uh all right so let me do test j all right everything's fine in here"
741920,749360," so semicolon it wants a semicolon uh what else does it want it's not a function right it's not a function"
749360,757200," and as you can see it compiles but if you accidentally uh confuse the order of the return uh return parameters"
757200,762880," it will tell you something really weird it will tell you that uh exclamation mark is not"
762880,768160," declared identifier so and that is extremely confusing and the reason why it tells you that is because"
768160,773680," the exclamation mark is overloaded right it is overloaded and it's not defined for this structure"
773680,779440," right but the error message itself is extremely confusing so john already fixed that today uh so"
779440,783280," the next better should be should be fine so which is just kind of cool"
783280,797120," i've only just recently started doing anything in law for video game wiki i don't know anything about it"
797120,804400," uh it's basically javascript uh but with the pascal syntax so that's everything you need to know about"
804400,809680," lure though type system of lure is better than the javascript system so it's stronger"
809680,815920," right actually if we took javascript today and replace it with lure we would be in a better place"
816640,818160," just because of the better type system"
818160,836240," okay so here are the parameters and let's also move the function right so the reason why i remember that"
836240,842960," example is because it's like literally similar example in here so this function depends on this input so i'm"
842960,850800," going to put it in here uh and i wonder if i have to actually do it here as well no i don't have to"
850800,857760," okay that's perfect and maybe in here okay so let me try to compile the entire thing and see where it"
857760,863520," is going to complain right so it complains about uh not having parse parameters okay so i can do quite"
863520,870720," quite easily import uh param right and hopefully it will find everything is it called param do i have to"
870720,881120," call it programs uh okay so is it like small okay so search path oh this is actually so cool unable to"
881120,887600," load a module called params in any of the module directories right so search path is this so i suppose we"
887600,896880," have like several options i know there in jay instead of import you can do a thing called lot uh which"
896880,903600," essentially works like like in include right so in ccc plus plus you have include and it just like takes"
903600,909520," the entire file and includes it in here uh but import like creates a separate module i don't know for sure"
909520,915680," right but yeah so i suppose for load we don't have to modify the search path let me let me actually try"
915680,922480," that and i think that was true that was absolutely true so i didn't have to modify the the include path"
922480,926800," so but to modify the search path i probably would have to"
928480,932720," uh use compile time parameters right so and i don't really want to learn about them right now"
932720,952320," all right so yeah we have parameters in here um and what's interesting is that i want to"
954560,961280," maybe uh abstract out this process you see this process is really interesting because it just"
961280,968080," iterates line by line and then does something with that line but at the same time i want to make this"
968080,976160," part parametrizable right so right now in the at the compile time what we do we simply add the parameter"
976160,983280," into the into the build right we just use add build string but maybe if you're doing runtime stuff you"
983280,988800," want to do something different for instance added to the to the hash table right which which makes"
988800,993920," sense right so at runtime you want to be able to move it to the hash table so what we can do here we"
993920,1000560," can probably extract that to a separate function that is parameterized by a lambda so we're going to be"
1000560,1008080," doing a functional programming in j do we have any functional programming fans in here"
1009520,1014960," where where where are where are all the people who ask me for my husky videos uh hello hello everyone"
1014960,1020160," welcome welcome welcome welcome so yeah so let's actually try to quickly do that"
1020160,1035120," um so uh probably gonna do it like this um so parse for m so um it's actually called parse for rams"
1035920,1043520," right so parse for rams and uh just define this function so and the way i'm going to"
1043520,1052160," factor out this entire stuff is simply by taking this entire piece of code and copy pasting it in here"
1052160,1059200," right but then you'll have to figure out what parameters do we have to put uh right do you have to"
1059200,1064320," define for this function for it to work i don't have to do that right because i have a statically"
1064320,1069360," typed compiled language and that statically typed compiler language can tell me what i need to add to"
1069360,1073280," the parameters so we can just do something like that as you can see it tells me okay you don't have"
1073280,1079200," for rams content so let's just you know accept it as a parameter in here right so something like that"
1080000,1087280," here you go you see how easy this see how easy this uh so we also have params file path but here's the"
1087280,1093760," thing params file path is a cons uh constant right is a constant that just needs to be defined somewhere"
1093760,1102160," here so it has to be a global context constant constant so we also don't have a workspace right so we"
1102160,1110640," probably also have to put it in here so uh work space but i don't know its type all right so what"
1110640,1120080," is the type of the workspace is it just um workspace like this i think that's what it is right this is a"
1120080,1129280," workspace um mismatching level of indirection um oh because it's not a interesting workspace is not a"
1129280,1136560," structure it's an id all right so that's actually pretty cool okay and surprisingly this entire thing"
1136560,1141040," works and i don't understand why i think i do understand why because i never called this function"
1141040,1147200," so the only thing i need to do now is just call this function with uh params content right so there"
1147200,1153680," we go so this is a prime's content and uh as you can see this is how easily i took the chunk of code"
1153680,1158480," and extracted it to a separate function and again i want to be able to"
1158480,1167680," essentially um parameterize this piece of code right i want to parameterize it somehow so that means"
1167680,1177840," i probably want to um accept i want to accept some sort of a function in here um accept some sort of a"
1177840,1185680," function into which i'm going to pass the param so let's actually quickly try to do that uh so"
1185680,1191600," this is going to be something like this uh and maybe i'm going to call it uh walk params right so this is"
1191600,1198080," a walk params and we're going to have a function called visit and i'm going to try to guess i'm going"
1198080,1203440," to try to guess how you uh syntactically define lambdas right so you probably do something like this"
1204080,1212160," right so this is going to be param and it shouldn't probably return anything right uh you know what i'm"
1212160,1217360," going to go to the examples and i'm going to just check the examples and see if they you know have"
1217360,1226480," anything um because i'm not sure uh lambda i'm not it's not examples it's how to okay lambda anonymous"
1230800,1240160," okay no example for lambdas all right uh so i remember the lambdas actually have uh stuff"
1240160,1246880," related to bake and this is uh probably something that we'll have to learn right so"
1246880,1256640," uh let me try to do that okay so usually people do something like maybe not not the big"
1258720,1274800," um i don't even know is it no that's none of the existing name actually uh easily to find um"
1274800,1287600," anonymous procedure okay so the same is saying f is anonymous procedure uh-huh wait okay so this is how you"
1287600,1294480," define okay okay this is the anonymous procedure this is the lambda itself right so and then"
1294480,1300320," if we take a look at call with it's a function okay so they didn't have a time for that specifically"
1300320,1308720," unfortunately uh okay okay so structs um"
1312560,1319920," yikes that's the only thing i can say yikes though i have a different approach to that right so maybe"
1319920,1329600," going like a functional programming route is not particularly great right so it's not particularly"
1329600,1330000," great"
1332880,1338880," because because you want to how is that you want to actually do something like an immediate"
1338880,1340960," style mode"
1340960,1346400," yeah i think something like that immediate style mode would be actually better"
1346400,1355840," uh where you have begin parameters you begin parsing parameters right um then you query the next parameter"
1355840,1360400," until you ran out of them and then you close the internet thing i think that would be uh way better"
1360400,1367040," right you know how you do immediate ui stuff right so immediate style parsing is actually a little bit"
1367040,1370080," better than functional style one with lambdas and stuff like that"
1370080,1378320," so i think i'm gonna go that route a dead marshal hello hello hello welcome welcome welcome how are you"
1378320,1385760," guys doing why are you so quiet today uh to to do to"
1385760,1397440," hello hello so we have a couple of subscriptions uh gd new man thank you so much for twitch prime subscription"
1397440,1402240," thank you thank you thank you i really appreciate that uh coming back hello what's up what's up what's up"
1406080,1414720," all right so let me try to actually do that right first j break um"
1414720,1422160," yeah so essentially as you can see here we have the state of the passing right so this is the state of"
1422160,1428720," the passing and this is where we can put it right so we can take the state and turn it into a structure"
1429280,1435200," right so something like params uh passer right from spasa and this is going to be a struct"
1435200,1440640," so in here um in here we're going to um have"
1440640,1445440," the content right so this is the content that is going to be simply a string"
1445440,1451760," and then we're also going to have a line number right so and i suppose it's going to be simply an"
1451760,1460480," integer um right and then we're going to have some sort of a function uh next perem right next perem"
1460480,1473040," next perem next perem it will accept the uh perem spasa probably by a pointer right so we're going to"
1473040,1481440," call it pp and it will return the next parameter and also maybe a boolean indicating that it's done"
1481440,1487840," parsing things but we also want to be able to indicate that uh there is an error right there"
1487840,1493520," is some sort of a like syntactical error in here so that means here we have two situations either end of"
1493520,1500400," file or um invalid parameter so maybe for that we need to come up with some sort of enumeration right"
1500400,1508960," so and the file and um invalid right something like this in both of the cases by the way we want to stop"
1508960,1516960," the iteration right in both of the cases we want to do that and also we need enumeration that indicates"
1516960,1523040," that everything is fine right so maybe we're going to have okay and the file and invalid right there's"
1523040,1530080," at least three situations in here so and we can have something like params failure or maybe pp"
1530080,1542160," fail right so it's going to be pp fail uh maybe not params params results right so it's called params"
1542160,1548400," result i think it's going to be a little better so params a result so this is the next parameter"
1551120,1559920," so when do we return end of file right we return when we don't have any content anymore right so if"
1559920,1569680," well this one is interesting we also need to be able to skip uh empty lines right so that's one of"
1569680,1576720," the things we'll have to do if content is uh equal to zero right so what we do we just return"
1579280,1588720," we just return nothing and end of file that's it we reached the end of file then we want to make this"
1588720,1595120," thing right so we want to move this entire stuff to here right so because that's a single iteration"
1595120,1601600," that we'll have to perform and i'll need to adapt it to to the entire thing so this thing is going to be"
1601600,1607440," customizable so we don't need that uh let me just try to compile that and see where it will complain about"
1607440,1615760," a couple things all right so um expect it right so it wants something like this in here right then uh"
1615760,1628240," we don't need that stuff anymore so let's call it parse params and okay so pp content uh what was that"
1628880,1635440," count count count count count count all right so parse params too many parameters"
1635440,1639680," w workspace"
1639680,1649040," anything else so okay so here's the rest so this is the content and this will become a rest"
1650320,1658640," uh rest rest rest we don't have to do that so we'll have to reassign pp content and the rest and then"
1658640,1666080," okay"
1666080,1674160," it's it's by the way it's the middle of the night"
1675440,1679360," if you if you if you guys didn't know it's the it's the middle of the night"
1679360,1685040," welcome to siberia"
1685040,1690720," um"
1690720,1695920," uh so"
1699440,1709360," yeah so so here's the time like literally middle of the night"
1709360,1713840," the keyboard too loud neighbor is upset yeah probably that's the reason"
1713840,1721440," okay so here's the line and it has to be pp line number"
1722560,1730400," uh is not a member of param space oh because it's called number number number number number"
1730400,1740160," look at that it's a number so but it's super easy to fix how do you swap a character in vim"
1740160,1749040," you have to press escape then x and then p in um in emacs you can swap it by pressing ctrl t"
1751360,1759040," easy okay easy can your vim do that i don't think so i don't freaking think"
1759040,1772640," so if we couldn't parse the parameter right if we couldn't parse the parameter essentially what we"
1772640,1781280," have to do we have to return uh nothing right and then return invalid so if everything went fine right"
1781280,1791120," if everything went fine we're going to i don't know return the param right i'm returning the param and the ok"
1791120,1799840," which is rather interesting which makes me think right which makes me out well i mean"
1799840,1805440," okay i can just return okay i have to return uh okay all right so that's fine"
1808080,1813040," all right all right that's pretty cool so that's a pretty simple and straightforward way of doing this"
1813040,1820400," and i think so you have to create the content then line number and stuff like that and yeah that is"
1820400,1837040," does dot curly braces give you like an an uninitialized or zeroed struct or whatever type context requires"
1837040,1846480," uh yeah i think i think that's what it does yeah so it's specifically structs for a race it's going to be"
1846480,1851760," something like this but for the structs is like this and as far as no it's just uh not just zero"
1851760,1856800," initializes but it uses the default value i think right i think that's what it does i think it just"
1856800,1862960," like uses the default values because you can specify default values for the structures like this right so"
1862960,1868240," you can put something like like this in here right i think i think you can do that"
1868240,1881040," all right so this is the next parameter and we also have maybe interesting situation like"
1881040,1890560," what if the line is empty right what do you do if the line is empty uh well you won't be able to easily"
1890560,1897760," parse that but maybe we can introduce something like empty right essentially it's invalid but it's"
1897760,1903760," empty and maybe this is something that you want to skip you know what i mean right um so it would be"
1903760,1908960," kind of cool if next foram skipped it automatically automatically but that means i'll have to make the"
1908960,1915200," logic a little bit more complicated than this right so do i want to make the logic more complicated than"
1915200,1924960," this i'm not quite sure right so because what i need to do in here is uh split the line right and essentially"
1924960,1934880," also trim the line if you know what i mean what i mean right and the question is how do you trim the line"
1934880,1943840," right so this is the frames trim um yeah that's what we want to do like trim"
1943840,1958080," because this thing returns several listening okay i'm gonna leave it as it is right so and if line count is"
1958080,1968880," equal zero you know what i have a better idea uh so let's actually let all of the empty lines"
1968880,1975280," let all of the empty lines to be invalid and when we parse things we're gonna ignore them"
1975280,1980160," and maybe uh put a warning in there okay so we're gonna do it for now like that"
1981280,1987840," uh all right so how are we gonna approach this entire thing so here's the params content right"
1987840,1995120," so what i want to do is just pp parser um programs"
1995120,2004480," parser right so this is a params parser and i'm gonna assign the content you know what would be cool"
2005360,2012320," you know what would be cool if we had functions like start parsing which also"
2012320,2018560," automatically read the entire file for you and then stop parsing which would automatically also clean up"
2018560,2032880," after after after the file"
2032880,2039440," all right"
2044240,2048880," um funcchi io monette is not a free monette free monette is a completely different thing"
2048880,2058800," um free monette is basically a monette that does not perform any effects but just builds up"
2058800,2066720," sort of like a ast which is then interpreted somewhere later so it's a completely different uh approach than"
2067680,2076800," the new monette so it's like a completely pure effectless monette that has effects later in uh by"
2076800,2084560," the means of some sort of special interpreter uh that can perform effects it's a really useful when you"
2084560,2091520," need to have an effect in a code that can't have effects you know what i mean right so the function"
2091520,2096720," programming people came up with all sorts of tricks just to not program in a normal programming language"
2096720,2097840," right so"
2097840,2107040," so they need to make the code pure for the sake of making it pure and to do that they came up with a"
2107040,2112400," lot of interesting tricks they could have just used you know a normal programming language right but"
2112400,2116960," they cannot do that because it's for normies right so that's why they need to come up with free"
2116960,2128480," moments and stuff like that so that's how it works"
2128480,2137200," so i just got one question at what age for how long you've been doing programming i started the program"
2137200,2142960," when i was 16 and i've been programming for 15 years i've been programming for almost half of my life"
2142960,2149360," just a little bit just one year and i'm going to be programming for"
2151040,2156160," yeah for half of my life essentially all right"
2156160,2160560," mm-hmm"
2160560,2174000," i started at 16 as well let me guess you're 17 now right i'm sorry uh all right so let's create something"
2174000,2182320," like start parsing um start uh parsing right so and then here"
2195840,2204960," prime spots"
2204960,2223360," so here i want to accept file path right so here we're accepting file path"
2224480,2230960," and uh it's probably going to be string but i keep losing my trail of thoughts so do i really want"
2230960,2237840," to do it right now probably uh probably not but that will also require you to do this thing okay that's"
2237840,2241520," fine uh param sparsa pp"
2245440,2257120," and oh yeah you you can't just do that right you can't just do that because then you'll have to initialize it like so"
2257120,2263040," uh the content is uh content params content"
2263040,2269440," uh programs content yeah there we go and then"
2271040,2277280," what we're gonna do right what we want to do we want to do next param"
2277280,2281360," pp which will return"
2281360,2286480," though what's interesting is that it would be a little bit easier"
2286480,2297600," if we returned param via the pointer if you know what i mean but i'm not sure if it's um proper idea"
2297600,2305360," if you know what i mean so it's a param and then okay right and i want to kind of continue doing"
2305360,2313360," this thing while i can right so can i just organize some sort of like in infinite look like while true"
2313360,2316560," right while true do that um"
2316560,2325200," if uh actually not okay but result right if result is uh end of file just simply break"
2326160,2330080," otherwise uh might as well you know do something like this"
2330080,2337600," case and just break in here so we have to also put semicolon"
2337600,2343520," like so then we're gonna have a case for invalid right so we're gonna"
2343520,2354160," um i'm gonna do it like that maybe i'm gonna say something like uh s then why is it so"
2356800,2358640," fucking noisy today i don't understand"
2358640,2374320," all right so um invalid invalid param"
2374320,2380800," so maybe it's gonna be warning right so it's just simply warning we say this is the invalid param"
2381440,2393120," uh params file path right rams file path and then i'm gonna do ppl line number uh in case of um in"
2393120,2399840," case of okay right in case of okay we simply do the thing that we're supposed to do in here we take the"
2399840,2407440," parameter tag and just apply this entire stuff right so this is the parameter tag there we go"
2408720,2417600," might as well maybe do something like this yeah um oh yeah basically like this so different parameters"
2417600,2422320," different situations um in here we just do it like that"
2424160,2429120," um cool so do we want to do anything else maybe i don't know"
2429120,2438240," uh we don't have to do parse params anymore we just need to do next param"
2438240,2447600," and as you can see we successfully uh decoupled the action that you want to do with the parameter"
2447600,2453440," from the process of iterating the parameters you see what i'm talking about so here is the code that"
2453440,2458640," iterates the parameters and when it encounters the parameter it just adds it to the compilation but we"
2458640,2465440," want to to decouple that right we want you to decouple that so we can just iterate it and then"
2465440,2471200," do something else if we need to right so because of that now we have next param that just takes you the"
2471200,2475840," next prime and then you can do whatever you wanted with it right in case of invalid so it will just"
2475840,2481840," ignore it and so that's basically what i did in here i decoupled two pieces of code right so this is"
2481840,2487760," the uh architecture lesson for you right you have a piece of code to functionality that is very coupled"
2487760,2494720," together like tightly coupled together and you just decouple them right so uh separation of concerns and"
2494720,2505280," stuff like that you know all of the good stuff uh all right so does it make sense right i think i think"
2505280,2510000," it makes sense i think it's a pretty good example of how you separate concerns right again i already"
2510000,2514240," mentioned you could have done that like two ways you could have done it functional ways where the"
2514240,2520400," function would just accept a lambda but i think in an imperative language it is easier to do it like in"
2520400,2526400," immediate style right so and in immediate style you just like have a function that just queries the next"
2526400,2531680," parameter all right just queries the next parameter and then you handle it what's interesting is that jay"
2531680,2540000," has iterators right and iterators are like macros right so they basically expand into the body of the"
2540000,2547600," for loop and i'm thinking can you turn the params pasta into an iterator and then iterate those parameters"
2548400,2554640," with the for loop right so you take the parampasa right you take the parampasa and then you just do"
2554640,2560880," for for param in pp right or something i don't know how you do that like maybe for program and pp"
2560880,2565600," and uh then every time you encounter okay it will just do that i think that's a pretty interesting"
2565600,2572000," idea but i'm not sure how you handle the uh the errors in that specific case like i'm not really sure"
2574320,2582800," but that's an interesting idea nonetheless so yeah okay what do you guys think is that a good idea maybe"
2582800,2590560," maybe it is all right so the pointer to take the pointer you have to do that and this is the semicolon"
2590560,2597920," and there we go i think we managed to do that so i want to try something interesting right i want to try"
2597920,2605760," to introduce some empty lines in here and see how it will react to that all right did it react to that"
2605760,2613120," at all uh i think it didn't react to that because it didn't even call that code right so debug is true"
2613120,2619120," and when it's debug when it's not debug right so i think i have to like actually invert that"
2619120,2625440," yeah there we go so as you can see it doesn't work i really like that i have no idea what the"
2625440,2634080," is going on in here right but it really doesn't work and the reason is because i'm an idiot right so"
2634080,2641840," there we go so it feels like it does not advance the next uh the next line as you can see it always"
2641840,2647360," complains about the first line actually it points to the um to the second one it just numbers them"
2647360,2655040," from zero so to probably fix that i need to maybe even take this piece of code and put it in here"
2655040,2661680," right so the line is plus one so here we encounter oh okay i see if we encounter something invalid it"
2661680,2672480," never really uh advances the rest but maybe it should right so essentially as soon as we split something"
2672480,2677920," right right as soon as we split something we should assign the uh the rest of the content like so"
2677920,2686640," right which makes sense um and also the question is maybe it makes sense to do it like that then"
2686640,2693280," but maybe not right so let's actually keep it like that it is extremely noisy today i really apologize for"
2693280,2701360," that"
2701360,2711600," um funky idea make a porth compiler and jive sure feel free to do that i don't mind"
2713600,2722000," what the fuck is going on today um"
2722000,2724480," um"
2724480,2726960," i don't know"
2726960,2738320," okay so we have that and that and here we okay so now as you can see uh we have a redeclaration of the"
2738320,2743200," variables so the variable so the variable was defined from the generated code and in here we have that"
2743200,2747040," okay so if i go into the jibreak um"
2747040,2751200," so jibreak.ji"
2751200,2753040," uh 15"
2753040,2760400," right so there you go okay i want to remove that okay that's cool uh so and there is no"
2761680,2766560," main entry point which doesn't make any sense"
2766560,2772800," in jibreak the designation entry point name is main"
2772800,2776400," excuse me"
2776400,2781840," uh is that because"
2785360,2786240," so i set"
2786240,2795520," so i set output to null so that should not affect anything"
2795520,2802640," um"
2802640,2808640," hmm"
2815360,2823920," okay so i don't quite understand um"
2823920,2830640," don't quite understand why this thing"
2830640,2836480," asks about the main right so it asks about the main let me see"
2836480,2844640," so here is the main main is in here right main is completely in here and if i try to build that okay"
2845200,2846400," now it doesn't complain about that"
2846400,2857280," okay sure uh so we have redeclaration of uh fps cool so let me maybe put that in here as well"
2857280,2867120," so and there we go all right cool so that's actually very very cool right because it references"
2867120,2876240," things like fps right but those things they are defined in a params dot config config right so"
2876240,2881120," this is a prime of the config which is parsed at compile time right okay so we've got that"
2881120,2888960," uh now i'm gonna go to the first dot j right so this is the first of j and the thing that i decoupled"
2888960,2894560," right so decoupled the way of iterating parameters from uh the actions that i want to perform on them and"
2894560,2898960," i want to move them into the module that is responsible for parsing the parameters right so"
2898960,2903520," it's the parameter j and i'm going to just like copy paste it in here and there we go everything"
2903520,2909840," related to parsing parameters is in its own separate module right so here's the module to"
2909840,2915760," parsing to parse the parameters we use it in a build uh in a build script but now that means"
2915760,2921440," i can use it in the program itself you know what i mean i can use it in the program itself"
2921440,2928720," to load things at runtime right i can load that stuff at the runtime"
2928720,2937520," which is kind of cool uh isn't it i think it's kind of cool uh all right so i'm gonna do it like that"
2939600,2945840," uh if i take a look at the uh at the game chat chat look look this is a game oh oh my god i have"
2945840,2951840," something cool on the screen i'm not doing a boring code anymore there is some pretty pictures on the"
2951840,2959760," screen isn't that cool oh my god who cares about that nerdy code right so what the is this"
2959760,2967120," new york am i right like this is what's cool holy fucking oh my god this pretty picture rainbowish picture"
2967120,2974400," oh my god so how did you create that no no don't talk about this nerdy code no no no but how did you"
2974400,2981600," make that right so anyway so uh what i wanted to do"
2982640,2995120," um i wanted to try to do this thing at runtime right so the question is how the question is how um"
2995120,3010160," because here is the thing here is the thing the all of these things are compile time right but i also"
3010160,3020880," want them to be treated as a runtime things as well right as the runtime as well so that means i cannot"
3020880,3031280," define them define them as constants i need to have some sort of an interface get param right which maybe"
3031280,3038320," accepts uh which maybe accepts the name of the parameter right so the name of the parameter and"
3038320,3046800," potentially returns the parameter like tu like take the union um what was that called i forgot so in"
3046800,3052560," params.gi uh yeah so and then it returns something like this"
3052560,3061600," right it would be nice to have this kind of interface right and then you would have two modules"
3061600,3067120," right you would have two modules the compile time thing and the runtime thing if you know what i mean"
3067120,3074240," so yeah"
3080720,3089760," okay so essentially yeah you want to create two modules you want to create two modules at compile time"
3090320,3104880," you want to create three modules the dynamic module and the runtime module"
3104880,3119520," nanometer i don't want to be rude but you are too back city you're a little bit too back city i have to"
3119520,3121680," actually put a lot of effort to ignore your messages"
3121680,3130720," all right so for how long i'm already streaming so i think i want to make a break"
3130720,3139120," and refill my water so let's continue i have an idea i want to try to"
3139120,3147600," actually generate separate modules right so for the compile time we're going to have one thing and for the"
3147600,3154000," runtime we're going to have another thing so for the runtime we need to have something some sort of an"
3154000,3160320," engine right that also uh holds the memory for the uh for the strings and stuff like that"
3160320,3174960," uh so for rams uh so this is just a param sparse right so this is a prime sparse and uh let me let me see"
3174960,3178720," so i want to come up with the name for the module that also holds the um"
3178720,3186320," the config right the params but unfortunately i can't really"
3186320,3193280," come up with the name for it because i want to call such modules params right i want to call it params"
3194080,3202720," uh right which may be an indicator right which may be an indicator right which may be an indicator"
3202720,3211920," that this is where i want to put that right that is very interesting point that is a very interesting"
3211920,3221280," point maybe maybe maybe this module should yeah it should also hold like the hash map it should also"
3221280,3230880," hold the hash map um that stores everything in there right so and then i just use the same mechanism both"
3230880,3235920," at build time and the runtime right"
3235920,3238240," um"
3238240,3240480," um"
3240480,3249280," so uh"
3251200,3256800," i think that's a pretty cool idea so but i need to learn how to use the hash map i need to learn"
3256800,3259680," how to use the hash map so let me see"
3259680,3270560," so if i go to opt jai modules right so this is the hash so there is a hash table okay that's pretty cool"
3271600,3276240," uh but the question is how do you use this hash table i wonder if there is like examples"
3276240,3282320," uh all right so there's no examples for this entire thing okay that's cool um"
3282320,3287840," so you can initialize this stuff"
3287840,3296640," initialize the table um so you know what i think i can maybe search for"
3298080,3303040," examples that include hash table right you can quite easily just uh do some topics hash"
3303040,3310000," uh table right there we go so this is a module in four so this thing uses the table uh all right"
3310000,3317120," but the question is where it doesn't look like it's using it anywhere um which is rather interesting"
3317120,3327120," so do you do init uh so you need sound in textures uh so let's search for the table then"
3328080,3335440," so it just imports the hash table but never uses it i suppose maybe uh what are the functions in there"
3335440,3343920," so that means init does it do any other in it um"
3351200,3359360," okay so there's not that many examples yet again so maybe this is not what you're supposed to use"
3359360,3367520," all right so there is on the hash table i can kind of figure out what how to use this entire thing"
3367520,3378480," right kind of figure it out um so it uses table so the table itself it probably accepts the key type"
3378480,3384240," right it accepts the key type it accepts the value type uh and then a bunch of parameters that are"
3384240,3389360," default parameters so i suppose if you didn't uh give a hash table is going to use some sort of like a"
3389360,3395360," default one yeah there we go so if it is defined it's going to use one thing it's not defined it's"
3395360,3403920," going to use a completely different thing so i suppose yeah you can just do it like that so maybe that's the"
3403920,3412400," thing i think i have to try so let me just go ahead right let me just go ahead and uh do this kind of"
3412400,3420480," stuff so it's going to test jay uh right import basic so this is the import basic and then the hash table"
3420480,3433840," right there we go so and i suppose i just want to have a table right so and this is a table where we're going"
3433920,3443920," to have um i suppose the string parameter right so this is a string and the value is going to be"
3443920,3452480," the tag the union right so tu tags union but for now i'm going to just keep it as an integer right so this"
3452480,3458480," is what i want to have and then i want to say initialize this entire thing right so initialize this entire"
3458480,3470480," thing um right and uh slots to allocate i suppose this is fine uh can you then free so you can then"
3470480,3477680," unmute this entire stuff and i suppose the easiest way to do that is just like on init uh table"
3480800,3489360," something like something like this cool let me now compile uh the entire stuff right so test dot j okay"
3489360,3494640," so it compiles so there's no any errors in here which is nice and the next thing i want to do i want"
3494640,3512720," to maybe insert some stuff uh insert um add um so let me see um resize table add okay that's cool that's"
3512720,3520400," pretty straightforward so i can i can work with that uh table add so let's add a couple of things in here so"
3520400,3529200," this is the table uh the key uh let me try to add key hello uh and the value in this case 69 all right"
3529200,3538320," so we're adding that then uh world uh for 20. so we added two things in here and i want to bring the"
3538320,3543840," entire stuff i do understand that it's kind of boring but i mean i'm literally seeing this module for the"
3543840,3550560," first time in my life like i open it for the first time on the stream i do understand that it's very"
3550560,3557280," frustrating and very irritating for people who want to backseat right so for people who know everything"
3557280,3562240," about this language but i'm seeing it for the first time and i just like want to learn it by myself"
3562240,3568240," right so uh if you don't like that i don't really understand why you're watching the stream in the first"
3568240,3578640," place um so so this stream is sort of like exploration of the topic together right so it's not like i know"
3578640,3585040," more about the topic than you right we're exploring things together um"
3587360,3597440," all right um to to all right even this is this content is not your thing i really don't know why"
3597440,3608080," you're watching this um it's interesting how the tap around this work seems like this style of language"
3608080,3616000," wants to avoid generics i mean it does have generics it's just like this syntactic is slightly different"
3616000,3624160," i would say they that the generics in this language syntactically make more sense right so essentially"
3624160,3629760," structure can have parameters so it's sort of like acts like a function it's a function that accepts"
3629760,3635840," other types and thus it constructs a new type based on those types right"
3635840,3650880," because interestingly generic uh structures are essentially compile time functions right so it's a"
3650880,3658480," function that at compile time takes a parameter of another type and returns a completely new type"
3659040,3666000," right so i already like provided some examples like that so you you can have a vector right"
3666000,3671360," and vector by itself in c plus plus right so in c plus plus std vector is a function compile time"
3671360,3677520," function right so and it accepts a parameter you pass it an integer and there you go this function"
3677520,3686320," returns a new type a vector of integers you see what i mean right integer is one type std vector is a function"
3686880,3693200," from one type from one type to another type you apply std vector function to int and you get a new type the"
3693200,3699200," vector of integers right so you can think about generic types generic types like that and here"
3699200,3704880," it just makes even more sense right so here is a structure here are the parameters of the structure"
3704880,3710480," and then when you want to construct the um the particular thing you just like call it as a function"
3711520,3717200," right it just it just makes sense right why to call a compile time function you need to have a completely"
3717200,3722400," different syntax well i mean it's it's just a function just a compile from function which accepts"
3722400,3730880," types and returns another type so for me it makes a lot of sense and then of course you can access those"
3730880,3738080," those types if you want to right so we can do table uh key can you do that uh probably not so what is the"
3738080,3747040," key type where do we refer to the key type uh oh yeah so we we basically take the the value and we extract"
3747040,3753280," the key type of it right so when it's just like generate something about them all right it's it's the"
3753280,3764480," parameter that was passed to the to the table itself all right so what i want to print i want to print the"
3764480,3774080," size of the table so can i have table size table count so there is uh if we do table count multiply by two"
3774080,3784080," so the count so i suppose the table just has the count right so which i can access which is nice"
3784080,3794240," so table uh contains uh contains these elements right so it contains this element stable count"
3794240,3803120," and i'm gonna put a new line in here right so let's actually do this kind of thing and uh let's just"
3803120,3808560," do the test and does it say uh does it say table contains two elements and everything's fine so i"
3808560,3821040," wonder uh there was something for the for loops wasn't it for expansion right which is rather interesting"
3821040,3831440," so i suppose this is a special macro that adapts the table to the for loop right i think that's what it does"
3832080,3837520," which kind of makes it possible for me to do something like for table and then print each"
3837520,3845920," individual entry of that table is that a thing i can do that's the question i really like to do it like"
3845920,3853120," that for table print it right and is it going to no it didn't really work uh semicolon okay so it wanted"
3853120,3862400," a semicolon and it worked it just worked it just worked right so i i think i this is my hypothesis"
3862400,3868160," because i remember john talking something about that um right so this is how you define iterators"
3868160,3875360," this is how you define iterators for custom data structures and jay you define some sort of a for expansion"
3875360,3883440," and the body of four expands into this right so that's basically what it does but i'm not 100 sure"
3883440,3892880," so let me uh take a look at some of the examples in here so jay and examples for uh they don't really"
3892880,3901360," talk about this is not how to uh expansion for uh default types for literals no they are not mentioned"
3901360,3909840," in here yet right they're not mentioned yet uh so let me let me see so it's not particularly mentioned"
3910400,3918720," but i suppose i suppose you can we can search it in in the modules right because maybe there are"
3918720,3924400," several uh data structures defined and for all of these data structures yeah so as you can see"
3924400,3934320," there is a thing for bit array um so on okay all right so far only for four hash tables um i can see"
3935200,3942000," a thing that is actually useful i'm not sure about bit arrays but okay anyway so we have that but the"
3942000,3951200," question is what if i so this is only values but what if i also want to have the um the keys right how"
3951200,3964800," can i have the keys so that's a good question so oh okay so you have to do it like this all right"
3965600,3968320," so maybe this is a key and this is the value"
3968320,3982640," i feel like you have to do it like that i have a strange feeling that you have to do it like that"
3982640,3994240," but it didn't really work well uh there we go it worked cool but it's not okay we confuse them so first"
3994240,4000400," comes the value and then comes the key all right so that makes a little more sense look at that look"
4000400,4007360," at that beauty isn't that cool isn't that cool i think it's cool it's absolutely freaking cool"
4007360,4016000," transpose words in emacs yeah you can you can do stuff like that it's not really transpose it's actually"
4016000,4022480," swap the words right so it's kind of cool right control t swaps the characters right you can swap the"
4022480,4030080," characters but alt t swaps the words so it's it's kind of the same logic right it's just like a"
4030080,4030880," different modifier"
4030880,4041600," okay so now we know how to use hash tables i do understand it is very slow it is very"
4041600,4046480," unproductive it pieces off people who wants to get things done as quickly as possible because they have"
4046480,4053120," you need to make everything as quick as possible but on this stream we're learning things we're"
4053120,4059920," exploring things we're discussing things we're just enjoying things you know what i mean i i do"
4059920,4065920," understand that people sometimes pissed off by that um like other people are pissed off that"
4065920,4070800," other people enjoy doing things but it is what it is if you're pissed off by that you probably shouldn't"
4070800,4081920," worth the stream cheers you mentioned iterators in vim in the past does it work the same i think it kind of"
4081920,4088880," worked the same but i can't answer for sure because i don't really know how exactly for expansion works"
4089520,4097760," i just assumed things right so i saw it and i assumed okay this is probably the element of the for loop"
4097760,4105760," and then i saw it index um and i just assumed that means it's the second thing and then i asked myself"
4105760,4112800," can the for loop have um the second thing and then i looked at this for loop and i noticed okay it does"
4112800,4119040," have two things so i came to a conclusion that this is the first thing of the for loop and this is the"
4119040,4123600," second thing and the first thing is assigned to value and the second thing is assigned to key"
4123600,4129120," right apart from that i know nothing about this syntax i know nothing about semantic of this thing"
4129120,4133680," i just like made a couple of assumptions really quick in my head i looked at things and i checked some"
4133680,4139040," things and i came to a conclusion i came to a hypothesis i checked the hypothesis hypothesis was"
4139040,4145760," right that's it i don't know anything else maybe there are some hidden interesting things about this"
4145760,4154480," for expansion maybe them some intricate semantics i don't care i don't know whatever so does it work the"
4154480,4161200," same as in nim maybe i don't remember how nim works though but what what i do remember is that in nim there"
4161200,4168880," is a keyword iterator which defines a macro like function that expands to a body which kind of"
4168880,4175040," similar to that so again i don't know maybe there are some differences in details"
4175040,4185920," so and just kgb is checking my query to the google so kgb approved my query to the to to google so now i can"
4185920,4192640," check that so here it is right there you go so this is how you do custom materials and new so i suppose"
4192640,4201840," it's parameterized by index and t it's using some sort of like a yield syntax you see it's using the yield"
4201840,4211920," syntax it accepts array and then you iterate uh the array and then you yield specific things"
4213920,4226960," um so they're compiled to inline loops right okay interesting i suppose syntactically they're they're"
4226960,4234640," kind of different but maybe not i don't know"
4237600,4244560," okay okay could you be with this new yeah i don't know like it's kind of actually funny how all of the"
4244560,4252560," like foreign services are slowed down they're just straight up slowed down well right now it's fine"
4252560,4259440," but if i go to yandex for instance it's pretty much instant right so"
4262000,4267520," so there you go but everything foreign like youtube google or anything like that they're"
4267520,4274880," they work but they just slowed down they usually take like you know like 10 seconds to load up for the"
4274880,4282000," first time and then the second load up is actually faster so again maybe it's like really kgb like manually"
4282000,4290880," checks it i don't know what the is going on i'm not even sure if they can do anything about this kind of"
4290880,4297920," stuff except banning it because all of that is https right so you can't really easily interject like in"
4297920,4299520," encrypted stuff but i don't know"
4303680,4310640," because the servers in russia are down so you get a delay does google have any servers in russia so that's"
4310640,4311440," a good question"
4311440,4318640," um well maybe it should have some yeah yeah yes it does okay"
4318640,4328560," hmm all right anyway so i'm pretty sure it's kgb doing something"
4331040,4335200," but zois in kgb doesn't exist well i mean they're rebranding themselves"
4335200,4341600," they have local service everybody to reduce the delay okay that makes sense"
4341600,4349520," okay so the reason why i was learning about the hash tables right uh is because i wanted to create a"
4349520,4358160," global hash table of the parameters right so so let's have params in here and this is simply going to be a table"
4358960,4370080," um right so this is the table that accepts a name um as the key and the value as the tag union"
4370080,4380720," right so you can have in the plot right very cool so this is the actual params and what i want to be"
4380720,4388720," able to do i want to have function that just loads this kind of stuff from a file into this table and so"
4388720,4396560," then i can use that at compile time to generate baked values and then at runtime to reload things"
4396560,4405280," i think that's a cool idea also i should probably um keep track of the params content right i should"
4405280,4411680," keep track of the params content which is a string right and the reason why i need to do that is because"
4414400,4423600," um the strings are views right so and as i chop them right they still refer to this memory and if i lose"
4423600,4430400," pointer to this memory um i kind of may corrupt some of the keys within the table so i have to be super"
4430400,4438880," careful with that right so i have to be super careful with that so now i want to actually uh go ahead and"
4438880,4445680," and create a function uh something like load params from file right so it will accept the file path"
4445680,4453120," um which is a string and will probably return nothing or maybe it will return a boolean indicating that"
4453120,4460560," it failed right for whatever reason for whatever reason it failed and i'm going to go to the build script"
4460560,4473520," right so this is the build script um where i'm gonna move this entire stuff to here okay so i need to replace"
4473520,4482720," this with file path and maybe if this is not okay i just return false see what i mean"
4482720,4495040," okay so how can i check that the params are null"
4497120,4508080," string has count right i know for a fact that string has count"
4508080,4510480," okay"
4510480,4518800," so i want to do something like this so i'm going to create a variable s um and this is going to be"
4518800,4530480," string right so this is the count right this is the count uh let me try to do that all right it's zero"
4530480,4541760," but it also has data all right and what is it equal to data is null so does that mean that there is a"
4541760,4550080," semantical difference between a null string and an empty string right so if i have something like uh an"
4550080,4558000," empty string right uh let's put it this way so this is an empty string and then i take a look at the data"
4558000,4559600," of an empty string"
4559600,4568000," this is very interesting so this is an empty string and this is"
4570000,4570320," though"
4570320,4582320," i wonder what's up with that is there any the reason the reason uh why i'm interested in that"
4582320,4590320," right the reason why i'm interested in all that is because uh if params content content um"
4590320,4598240," is not null right it is not null uh i need to free that data before loading a new data"
4600000,4606720," you see what i mean right so i need to free that data somehow um so and that's a good question"
4606720,4611120," how can i do that so and how do you free the um"
4611120,4615840," the strings right so this is the module"
4616960,4624640," i want to find the rfn read entire file so there's a couple of things in here you read entire file and"
4624640,4633120," then you just free the okay so you literally just free the data itself you free the data itself"
4634880,4643200," all right maybe it is totally fine to actually depend on that i think i think it's kind of fine"
4644160,4648960," so if params content params content"
4648960,4658160," data not equal to null then free params"
4658160,4669600," params content data right then you load up the content interestingly if we couldn't load the file"
4669600,4677680," maybe we shouldn't free the data right so that probably makes sense after that we free the current"
4677680,4685920," data and then we reassign the content there we go cool um"
4685920,4693760," yeah that makes sense so this condition is needed just in case we load for the first time if we load"
4693760,4699280," for the first time it will be null so it's not going to be freed but maybe free null is fine"
4700000,4705360," right you know maybe it is fine let's actually try to do that yeah i think i think it's fine okay so"
4705360,4712000," we loaded this entire thing up uh and now what i want to do is i want to go to the first"
4712000,4717920," and start the iteration process right i'm going to start the iteration process i'm going to start the"
4717920,4725360," uh the parser right so i'm going to start the parser i'm going to put our uh parsing stuff in here"
4725360,4732560," and when we encounter when we encounter parameter the thing i want to do in here is just i want to do"
4732560,4742880," table add right so params uh actually take a pointer uh param name param value there we go"
4742880,4751040," so i'm basically populating the entire the entire table another thing i would like to do with the table"
4751040,4765440," as well is to clean the table clean uh uh clear uh clears okay there is a reset okay that's cool"
4765440,4772960," so this resets the current number of allocated slots it just clears uh occupancy it's i like this behavior"
4772960,4777440," but array reset freeze memory and that is confusing see array reset for more discussion"
4777440,4784640," okay oh i remember that so yeah table reset uh just basically cleans the entire thing"
4784640,4792160," does it clean the entire thing"
4792160,4802560," yeah i think i think this is the thing that i have to call so i'm just like i was not sure if this is the"
4802560,4805120," thing i want to call but i think that's the thing i want to call"
4805120,4814960," it cleans the thing but doesn't free the memory uh yeah so the memory can be reused then which doesn't"
4814960,4818400," make sense right so and that's precisely what i want um"
4822800,4836080," okay okay so yeah this is very cool so i have a self-contained module which can basically um load"
4836080,4844240," modules into the hash table and i can use this entire thing to generate stuff all right so let me go to the"
4844240,4853680," the compilation step and in here i'm going to be iterating the um the params value name uh params"
4853680,4858800," right and then i can take a look at the value tag"
4858800,4870080," uh-huh all right so this is the value uh maybe i'm gonna even do something like this yeah cool all right"
4870080,4874880," so i iterate the value name and then i take a look at the value tag and then i add it like that"
4874880,4876480," there you go"
4876480,4886560," so it's debug it will generate this thing so as you can see yeah that's very cool and then"
4886560,4895440," at runtime in in the program i can use the same code i can use the same module that's what makes it cool"
4896240,4902720," in here is that i can like reuse literally the same code as i said compile time i just load it into here"
4902720,4910000," into the memory and then i generate code based on that but then i can switch the uh the boolean and"
4910000,4914400," just use the hash map directly that's what i can do it's actually very cool"
4918240,4924800," and the need for yeah i need for actually okay so let me try to compile the entire thing so i'm going"
4924800,4932480," to do giant first and see if this entire thing even compiles so uh file path of course i keep forgetting"
4932480,4940640," this entire thing and let me see so table reset we probably need to import the hash table all right so hash"
4940640,4953680," table right file path uh not control flow something something i suppose we forgot the last thing to say"
4953680,4961120," in here uh true so if we reach the end of file we just have to break in case of invalid we just ignore"
4961120,4970320," invalid lines for now um which is totally fine all right so uh get param expected"
4970320,4978960," oh yeah so it was just like a unnecessary thing what else do we have in here so undeclared fps and"
4978960,4986720," this is because we are in debug mode i can't quite understand because let me take a look at the generated"
4986720,4994480," strings all right so i can't see anything let me quickly clean up the build folder right because i want to"
4994480,5006720," generate uh new strings right and doesn't look like it generated anything and declared fps"
5012240,5022560," so if debug true oh i never actually called that okay that is annoying yeah so we need to load the"
5022560,5031600," entire thing we need to load the entire thing perhaps so but we also need to initialize the uh the table"
5031600,5040720," so that's another thing um okay let's do load uh probably we'll probably have to load it in both of"
5040720,5056640," the cases like load from file for rams file path and also uh ht init for rams like so and let's do it like"
5056640,5063120," that and since we're loading maybe i can do something like this as well so ht"
5065280,5078800," yeah yeah okay okay so ht anything else ht anything else uh undeclared identifier for exp oh"
5078800,5090720," i wonder if i can do something like for expansion uh ht for expansion can i do like that"
5091600,5104560," uh uh apparently i can that's pretty cool okay so if i wanna like uh yeah so i wanna have like a name"
5104560,5110640," space for all of the functions but for expansion apparently has to be in the same um in the same"
5110640,5116800," scope because of that i had to do it like that and i purely guessed that like this is the beauty of this"
5116800,5126080," language like i know nothing about this language it just makes sense uh right so that's the beauty of"
5126080,5133120," a good design of a language right so you don't have to learn features you can just guess how the"
5133120,5140000," features work based on like the logic of the whole system if the whole system is sort of coherent you can"
5140000,5144560," just extrapolate all of your knowledge and then guess how things supposed to work"
5144560,5152880," um again i know nothing about like four expansions like a module system and stuff like that but the way"
5152880,5161600," module system in jai is amazing i didn't have to learn it so the problem with for instance rust module system is"
5161600,5170320," that i'm using rust since 2016 and i still don't understand how rust modules work they are extremely"
5170320,5176320," confusing holy that's probably the most confusing module system i've ever seen maybe i'm just dumb"
5176320,5182480," yeah like everybody who watches me they they know that i'm dumb uh but i just like can't wrap my head"
5182480,5189120," around it like i basically memorized a couple of like patterns how to use modules in rust and i just like use"
5189120,5194720," only them and then try to go any anywhere fancier but this module system i just like i just use it"
5194720,5200720," and it makes so much sense and it has name spaces and stuff like that it's just it it makes sense uh"
5200720,5206960," box tongs thank you so much for which translation thank you thank you i really like that i really like"
5206960,5215600," how much sense this language makes um it's beautiful it's absolutely beautiful all right so let me see uh"
5215600,5223040," what do we have uh so it builds and everything is fine and let's try to run the jailbreaker okay so"
5223040,5227840," everything seems to be working so now right"
5227840,5237600," what i want to do we probably need to i already said that we need to generate a separate module"
5237600,5246400," or do we need to generate a separate module it's kind of interesting actually"
5246400,5256480," i can probably come up with absolutely dumb example okay if this thing is that"
5259680,5266560," i should probably i should probably i should probably turn this constants into"
5266560,5276880," into functions but these functions should be sort of expandable i think so what i recently noticed"
5278720,5292880," in how to uh expand all right so there is a very interesting uh marker in here called expand right"
5292880,5300080," and what i'm thinking is that so does it make it in lineable what's the difference between expand and"
5300080,5305920," in line for instance is there even in line uh probably not i think it's just called expand"
5306640,5311360," maybe i can turn all of these constants into expandable function"
5311360,5315360," so there is an insert"
5315360,5323760," so i'm just trying to"
5323760,5330240," uh i'm a little bit tired so there's no expand but there is an insert"
5332160,5337680," okay and we see expand for the first time in here and there is not that much explained"
5337680,5345520," in terms of expand unfortunately it can operate on code that is already uh okay so but"
5354320,5363520," so i can only assume what expand means right i can only assume that all right i know it's really bad"
5363520,5369280," for getting the shit done i'm sorry uh okay"
5376480,5382000," there's so there's so many cool complicated features that i'd like to learn how to use but there's just"
5382000,5391920," like no examples for them uh unfortunately though we can try to to just play with some of those things"
5391920,5402160," right so test j and if i define something like um you know fps right and then say expand"
5402960,5410640," right right and it should return an integer uh and then they return an integer will this at least compile"
5410640,5416480," right so that's the real question will this at least compile when i try to call it like this"
5417840,5435600," um okay it kind of works"
5435600,5437760," there we go okay it kind of works"
5437760,5442960," so i kind of want to use this for the constant"
5444720,5452000," i wonder how many people who know jay will be pissed off by me doing metaprogramming this way"
5452000,5460240," do i really care about people being pissed off i mean no matter what i do somebody's going"
5460240,5466240," to be pissed off so it doesn't matter so yeah essentially instead of generating the"
5466240,5470960," constants i want to generate these things so you're forced to do this kind of stuff"
5473600,5477760," uh creates a macro that can access variables from the outer scope"
5477760,5484160," oh okay wait a second um that's actually pretty cool wait"
5484160,5488800," uh so let's put 420 in here and then you can say x"
5488800,5501760," lies while expanding uh here and declare the identifier so you probably have to insert it"
5503440,5507520," all right while expanding macro here"
5507520,5515680," oh you have to use back tick"
5515680,5516880," okay"
5516880,5521520," whatever"
5521520,5527840," okay so you know what i think i'm gonna just use it as a functions then"
5528320,5533760," um"
5533760,5538000," yeah i'm gonna use i'm gonna just like use functions"
5538000,5543360," and maybe hope for the optimizer to just basically inline all of them"
5543360,5548400," i wonder if there is any mention of online inlining in general let's see"
5550560,5556720," uh how to inline inline assembly not really what i want it but yeah"
5556720,5563120," so is the inlining inlining probably probably done automatically"
5563120,5571120," the most confusing thing is that for the structure i agree on the rust module system the most confusing"
5571120,5577200," thing is that for the structure changes what you put on the inner module so if you move modules into inner"
5577200,5581920," uh okay uh yeah it is confusing i don't agree with that um"
5581920,5584960," okay so there's a lot of oh my god"
5584960,5590960," that was a bad idea because there's a lot of c code in here okay so i'm not gonna do that all"
5590960,5596080," right so it can be figured out later right so i want to just make something that works"
5597280,5602320," and then we'll see how it could be improved right so because the the code is not static a lot of people"
5602320,5608880," think that you have to write perfect code first try i strongly disagree right it pieces people off"
5608880,5613200," like every time everything i do pieces pieces people off it's actually quite surprising"
5614080,5627600," um all right so let's go so this is going to be the name and then in here i just cannot infer the type"
5627600,5635440," can it infer the type probably cannot infer the type though it doesn't really matter because it can do"
5635440,5648800," something like that so this is going to be the name right this is the value uh-huh okay cool"
5648800,5652960," float return"
5658640,5662880," so so so that's fine for now at least"
5662880,5667680," what the fuck are you doing"
5667680,5675760," okay so i want to have some targets and the reason why i'm doing it like that is that then when it's um"
5675760,5685120," when it's time to do the runtime generation i can translate those calls into query in the hash table"
5686720,5693360," yes that's what it can do all right so let me let me try to build into i think um"
5693360,5700320," i should actually use first giant uh-huh okay so type mismatch"
5700320,5707920," float but given function integer so i have to do it like that right and the problem here is that"
5710640,5719280," uh oh that's cool okay so now yeah i have to go through all of these things and replace them with"
5719280,5725440," that okay so this has to run so that's kind of a that's kind of a problem right so i'll have to"
5725440,5733280," run all of these things um which again is inconvenient i'm sorry whatever i do pieces you off i'm i'm really"
5733280,5740160," sorry if that piece is yo but i'm exploring things i'm really sorry for committing a crime of learning"
5740160,5749040," things on the stream i'm really fucking sorry um okay so what do we have in here that mismatch so"
5749040,5756880," that's very weird right because it's a function target okay let me take a look at the target height"
5757440,5762800," oh okay i see and probably have to do that um cool"
5762800,5781600," okay which does not necessarily make all of that uh runtime stuff right which does not necessarily make"
5781600,5790720," all of that runtime stuff"
5790720,5799440," i feel like i want to make a break i feel like i want to make a break what do you think i'm already"
5799440,5805200," just doing for almost two hours and i'm going anywhere should have just ignored the chat more"
5807840,5815680," marianne we need to make a break i need to make a break my brain is frying so let's make a small break um"
5815680,5828880," okay so let me see uh i've got my tea so i need to think how we're gonna approach this entire stuff"
5828880,5836640," right so you can't just have compile time functions unless you prefix them with the run"
5837360,5844800," right unless you prefix them with the run but that like sort of creates additional problems"
5844800,5851200," that are kind of difficult to resolve right"
5851200,5860960," so because like things that were compile time now become runtime and vice versa"
5862080,5870400," so you have to be super careful with that specifically right so i want to kind of go back in terms of"
5870400,5876560," uh the main file right so i made a couple of changes here in the main file so i'm gonna"
5876560,5886320," revert them uh and i'm gonna see uh how it's going to go so project size uh it's defined in here"
5886320,5894080," right so an fps is also defined in here uh right what do we have in here uh approach size let me see"
5894080,5898480," let me actually manually go through all of these things so bar thickness"
5900960,5908880," so bar thickness i have a feeling that the more these kind of parameters shouldn't really depend"
5908880,5915120," on each other very much right they should probably depend on each other within the config the config itself"
5915120,5921600," should uh support cross-referencing but in here it shouldn't be like that i think"
5922560,5931440," uh all right so what i want to do is probably go into the programs jim actually params.com uh right"
5931440,5938240," and i'm going to introduce the bar thickness right so this is the bar thickness and it is going to be"
5938240,5942720," equal to the approach size right so let's actually do it like that this is approach size"
5943920,5958320," so and let me remove that uh bar y is also really interesting so i'm using the uh why so here it's"
5958320,5967520," more of like a padding yeah it's more of a padding so what i want to do in here is probably rename this to"
5967520,5982400," bar padding um maybe why padding uh bottom right that's what i want to have in here uh all right approach"
5982400,5994880," size so target height uh let's maybe move this thing in here so target height uh float is going to be 20 as"
5994880,6000800," well right so eventually i'm going to move all of these things to there"
6000800,6010160," oh here we have padding x and padding y so that means maybe the convention should be rather like this"
6010160,6017120," right the convention should be rather like this okay so what else do we have in here"
6017920,6030880," um so type float but got okay approach size uh-huh all right so here is the initial state approach x"
6030880,6039120," uh-huh and okay so all of these things are initial states which probably means that i can just like do it"
6039120,6050640," look like that approach size should be also like this uh and is that it uh okay and target height uh though"
6050640,6058480," how target height is oh okay so because i actually change it uh like this"
6060240,6070240," uh uh one over fps and uh delta time in seconds where do we use data time we don't use it so it doesn't"
6070240,6078160," matter okay that's even better actually that is actually even better uh okay so what's that attempt"
6078160,6082080," to call perform procedure call okay um"
6082080,6092800," you know i think all of this initialization has to be a separate function"
6092800,6098560," that is called at runtime i feel like all of this stuff has to be a runtime"
6099600,6110960," uh i think all of that stuff has to be runtime okay so in it uh state right so it's called in its state"
6110960,6118480," all right so this is in its state and i'm going to move all of these things there"
6118480,6129280," right so target pool because of that um this one because it will make it everything runtime"
6129600,6136720," right everything will become runtime which will make this stuff easier and also it will make it easier"
6136720,6143360," to restart right if i want to restart something it's i can just call to this thing and that is it"
6143360,6152320," right so any targets returns this thing all right so that means i'll have to put it like that"
6153600,6156720," and in here i can just do it like this"
6156720,6170560," okay that's fine for these things i can just make them uh booleans right so this is a boolean"
6170560,6177840," and the score is going to be an integer right we're not going to initialize them because they're going"
6177840,6184000," to be initialized by in its state uh sorry if the way i code pieces you off"
6184000,6191600," i'm really sorry about that okay so uh i do realize that you probably need to create some sort of a"
6191600,6201360," structure right nice then have initializer for the structure um sorry i'm sorry that my code is not"
6201360,6206640," finished yet okay so this is another place where we have a runtime stuff"
6206640,6216560," okay and bar why okay so we don't have a bar why uh this is because we renamed it so now it's um"
6216560,6224240," padding all right so bar why was this"
6226160,6235920," uh-huh and here what we have to do we have to do bar uh padding y bottom something like this yeah there we go"
6235920,6238160," okay cool"
6238160,6249680," bar thickness did we move it here i think we moved it here okay and this is another bar thickness"
6251120,6255280," uh uh so bar y"
6255280,6259440," um"
6259440,6264160," padding"
6264160,6274000," so i actually have that in more than one place so i probably have to do it like that"
6276960,6283840," which you can probably fix a bit later all right so this is another approach size"
6283840,6286560," uh-huh"
6286560,6290480," adding why"
6302720,6308880," fuck yeah okay okay so this approach like requires a little bit of like working around but"
6308880,6317600," apart from that seems seems okay okay so now let's see if i didn't break anything uh everything seems"
6317600,6322800," fine look at that look at that beach uh-huh"
6325600,6333600," all right so now we're ready to do something cool okay if this is debug actually i think it has to be"
6333600,6341120," not debug i i made a mistake so this is not debug right when we are in debug when we are in debug we have"
6341120,6347680," to generate different set of these functions this is quite important we have to generate a different set"
6347680,6356800," of these functions uh first of all uh first of all we'll probably have to do this thing in runtime as"
6356800,6361040," well um but the question is how would we do that"
6361040,6369680," maybe we should intercept the compiler maybe we should intercept the compiler"
6370960,6377760," and when we encounter main maybe add like a couple of lines at main but i don't know how to do that"
6377760,6384880," again so this approach to hot reloading is not really final i'm doing it based off of the knowledge"
6384880,6392080," that i already have and jai and my plan is to then update this approach and make it better as"
6392800,6400080," as i learn jai i'm really sorry that my approach pisses you off if you have like extensive knowledge"
6400080,6406080," of jai you probably know that like how to do that very effectively very efficiently and you probably"
6406080,6410880," know that there is a module somewhere in jai and stuff like that and you're really really pissed off"
6410880,6416640," that this dumb russian uh doesn't want to learn anything right doesn't want to read documentation and"
6416640,6422320," just follow your advices i i'm really sorry for that but that's the way i learn something is"
6422320,6428720," fucked up in my brain something is really fucked up in my brain the only way for me to learn things"
6428720,6435600," is to try to make the dumbest solution and then slowly improve it and that way i learn i know it's"
6435600,6443200," completely fucked up i should probably visit a doctor i should probably do that i'm sure if i find a doctor"
6443200,6451200," for my disease but that's the way i learn and that for some reason really pisses off people i still don't"
6451200,6456320," understand why they just see code that is suboptimal and they just go nuts"
6456320,6465040," and it's just like i'm i'm learning i'm sorry so i know that it's bad and stuff like that but"
6465040,6472640," i don't know people are weird some people not everyone actually so quite a few people understand"
6472640,6477840," this approach but some people just like go fucking nuts it's just like they they can't hold themselves"
6477840,6485200," it's just like they start shaking what the fuck do you write um it's absolutely waiting well i've seen"
6485200,6490720," a lot of people so since i have a lot of people coming in and out uh there's a quite a few people"
6490720,6495200," who are just like straight up pissed off by the way i learn things they just straight up pissed off"
6495200,6510240," um i don't know so to those people i really apologize i'm sorry i'm sorry that i'm only learning"
6510240,6523600," things all right so"
6524160,6534480," so"
6534480,6543360," and the fact that jai already has a module for doing what i do pieces of these people even more"
6543360,6549600," it's just like why the fuck would you implement this which is kind of weird i mean like why the"
6549600,6554000," fuck would you implement jai in the first place then there is already c plus plus am i right so"
6554000,6562080," it's a really weird logic there is a rust there is it you know d c plus plus why are you implementing jai"
6562080,6569440," anyway so let me let me see"
6574240,6582480," d kappa d is actually quite good you can actually there is an interesting flag in d uh which is"
6582480,6591280," called beta c right which basically strips off features of d to the point of c preserving everything"
6591280,6598640," right like metaprogramming and stuff like that right so it's just like sort of extending c but with d"
6598640,6603680," with its template system meta programming and stuff like that but without garbage collection"
6603680,6609600," and some other stuff that c developers may not want uh so"
6609600,6617760," so it's kind of an interesting idea right so we can use d which is like a compile compiled native java"
6617760,6622480," right because it have a gc and stuff like that but at some point you can put the flag better c and it"
6622480,6629600," turns it into c extend it with this like meta programming um which is kind of an interesting idea"
6629600,6637200," so this language is just trying to please everyone at this point right so which is usually doesn't really"
6637200,6645280," go well uh okay so what we don't do in here uh i suppose one of the things i want to do"
6646560,6655520," i probably want to include the params dot j that's probably what i want to do right"
6655520,6660080," so i'm literally just doing um"
6660080,6671520," load uh for rams of the chat is that is that a good idea i don't even know i guess i guess it is um"
6672880,6681520," so semicolon right and i'm going to add it to the to the workspace another interesting thing is that i"
6681520,6688880," probably want to add an indication that we are in a debug mode right so this is going to be debug"
6688880,6696080," and uh it's going to be true right this is true and since i'm introducing this thing i probably need to"
6696080,6702560," put this thing to false um again i really apologize this is a very dumb way of doing that"
6702560,6707200," you should probably not do add build string at all you should probably generate a file first"
6707200,6712240," or maybe there is a function that accepts code i'm really apologize please don't get mad at me"
6712240,6718480," i'm sorry i'm learning things okay um okay"
6718480,6728640," uh this thing is a dereferencing this thing is a reference for anyone who's interested so okay in here"
6728640,6735200," what we have to do what we have to do what we have to do we have to take params right and rather do"
6735200,6746640," something like table um maybe i shouldn't do it like that um have an idea get int per ram"
6748160,6753040," i think that's pretty cool yeah get int per ram and"
6753040,6758720," do i have to do yeah i should probably also provide a name"
6758720,6765600," and name will go here right so this is the name and i'll have to use it twice"
6767280,6777680," um so name here comes the name and then we get int param and yeah that there we go okay so now we have"
6777680,6788240," to do float uh and this is ah why print contains int it makes it inconvenient to replace things print"
6788240,6790880," should not contain int let's rename it to something else"
6790880,6800640," uh all right so this is going to be full okay so we have a bunch of things in here uh that's pretty cool"
6800640,6806480," yeah maybe we should call puts i think it's a little better"
6809680,6819520," um print print yeah okay so that's very cool what i need to do in here essentially is now"
6819520,6827280," if you are in debug mode if you are in debug mode"
6831840,6837840," initialize the parameters and load this stuff from the params file path uh i'm probably gonna actually"
6837840,6846000," add this thing in here right like so so this is the params file path so we loaded this thing up"
6846000,6854480," uh because of that we also need to include ht right so this is the first"
6856480,6865040," uh ht is it should be already available because it's loaded uh from params right it is loaded from params"
6865040,6875520," um do we need to do anything else do we need to do anything else i feel like the only thing that is left"
6875520,6878800," is to i don't know"
6881280,6893200," check for like f5 right so let's do case f5 and load param file right so calling this function"
6893200,6896720," the second time will essentially reload the param file"
6904800,6911200," and it should be only available if we are in debug mode right so if you're in the bug"
6911200,6916640," i wonder if that's something that you can easily do right so can you can you just do it like that"
6916640,6924800," we're about to find out actually but that'll be rather convenient uh that will be a rather convenient"
6924800,6930960," okay case inside uh block that isn't of the form okay so you you can't just do that"
6932480,6941120," though we can put this thing like that which creates an empty case and i wonder if that pieces"
6941120,6950880," of the compiler too much that's a good question uh huh so what do we have get get into param okay so"
6950880,6956960," uh that's actually pretty cool so now i'm gonna go to params right so get into program it's going to take"
6956960,6964720," the name right so the name right so here is the name and it will return an integer right so table"
6964720,6975360," uh how do you get okay so i never actually got table get find okay so you can find the pointer"
6975360,6983680," you can just find uh huh all right so i will provide the params"
6984880,6993360," which actually provided by value which is fine i suppose a key is going to be name and then we get"
6993360,7007040," a value and success right and i suppose i'm going to just assert this success for now and return the value"
7011760,7018560," so you can also notice that i could could have used like a type parameter in here because i'm kind of"
7018560,7023200," duplicating this thing right it would be better to have a time parameter in here and i'm really"
7023200,7029040," apologizing that if that pieces you off so the fact that i don't have a separate type parameter just for"
7029040,7035440," int and float uh if that pieces you off really really badly i'm really sorry for that like i'm genuinely"
7035440,7043280," sorry that that pieces you off uh i'll fix that later maybe if i'm i'm in the mood right so yeah"
7043280,7050720," okay let's continue uh what else do we have in here table find uh ht"
7050720,7057840," some people will be pissed off like you you have no idea how many people have seen"
7058400,7064720," i've seen people who will be genuinely pissed off by this fact right so they'll be fucking mad"
7064720,7068720," um likely those people don't watch me anymore usually so"
7068720,7077360," anyway uh we need to extract um so since it's a value right so we'll also need to extract some other stuff"
7078320,7081280," uh right so we need to do this kind of thing"
7081280,7091280," so this is that so this is an integer and this is a float"
7091280,7105760," okay what else uh split undeclared identifier split from left oh this is because it uh needs a string"
7106480,7110960," all right uh what else is it you read entire file it needs a file"
7110960,7123600," did it just work did this mother flipper just work right so i wonder if i take a look at this so are we"
7123600,7133200," in debug right we are in debug that means it went to this branch where it generated like a runtime stuff"
7134640,7144080," now i can try to do jay break right and it seems to be working which is cool now uh let me try to"
7144080,7154160," go to the params dot com and here we see a couple of interesting things in here for instance"
7154160,7158880," uh bar thickness right i'm gonna change it to 100 and i'm gonna press f5"
7164240,7172240," it works it may be suboptimal it maybe doesn't use the standard giant module right but it works"
7172240,7179600," and i wrote it myself which makes i understand like to some degree how this entire thing works"
7179600,7185840," i'm sorry that i didn't get uh done very very quickly and i'm sorry if that pieces you off but"
7185840,7193520," i get the done and i learned things again if the way i learned things pieces you off i'm really sorry that's"
7193520,7203200," how i learned things okay so that's pretty cool so we have a working thing"
7203200,7212880," right and we can slowly start uh migrating we can slowly start migrating the um right"
7214640,7223360," these constants to the params dot config right so we have only uh some things in there but we're gonna"
7223360,7229680," have more and more and more plus we can start optimizing this entire process like making it more"
7229680,7237440," uh i don't know more robust because right now we're generating uh a lot of text but i actually saw that"
7237440,7243440," there is a type called code right so i can't even show you i have no idea how to use it yet i'm really"
7243440,7249280," sorry that i didn't learn it before the stream and i decided to do it on the stream uh right so but we"
7249280,7254800," can find something like this so this is going to be code right so you can do shit like that which is"
7254800,7264480," actually rather fascinating so this creates a block of code right and it has the type code and i think"
7264480,7270560," you can even traverse like modify things and you can even pass it around like this so it would be"
7272160,7278960," kind of cool if instead of like strings we would generate this kind of code that is properly parsed"
7278960,7285200," and properly type checked and stuff like that right and then we would push it instead of the strings you"
7285200,7290640," know what i mean it would be interesting for me to learn this kind of thing and again once you have"
7290640,7296960," something working uh extending it and improving it with this new feature becomes easy because you already"
7296960,7301920," have something working right you can apply the feature to it doesn't work you can fix it until it"
7301920,7307520," works again right it is easier to like use all these features on something that is already kind"
7307520,7315040," of working so it's iterative process it is kind of hacking it is kind of hacky at me that is it's so it"
7315040,7321040," sucks so much i look i do agree with you it's it's absolutely horrible look at this shit this is the"
7321040,7329840," shit you would write in pure c but again it is working it is doing its job and you can use it as the sort of"
7329840,7334720," like a base for learning more and more interesting cool features about the language so that's my"
7334720,7340720," approach that's my approach that pisses off people i don't know why i think it's a very effective way of"
7340720,7348880," learning things but that pisses off people anyway i just pisses off people sorry um so"
7348880,7357440," yeah so i wonder what other things we can actually move there uh so one of the things i would like to move"
7357440,7364960," there is colors all right so because uh it would be kind of cool like in the css style to like modify"
7364960,7366960," colors and just like check things and whatnot"
7366960,7378560," so score padding oh yeah score padding left and score padding top i think these two things are very useful"
7378560,7385280," right because then i'll be able to like adjust score and whatnot uh so for ramps dot com if i'm"
7385280,7392960," going to just put it in here uh and these two things uh let me just put it like that float right flow like"
7392960,7399040," that i wouldn't need that with any debt so both of those things uh those things are float are they float"
7399040,7408240," score padding because i actually use them as integers so i probably want to make them integers right so if i try to"
7408560,7421040," now build uh so it's that first gi right okay so we have this oh because it's it has to be equal"
7422320,7427760," so that's the syntax uh right so this is that"
7427760,7432880," anything else score left"
7432880,7443360," okay all right that is very cool okay so now i can just run this okay"
7447840,7451920," i wonder if i can split some stuff"
7451920,7457520," to some extent it's kind of difficult to see what the hell is going on but i can try to do something like this"
7457520,7464000," right for rams dot com right and now i can say okay 100"
7464000,7470480," and yeah i can move it around that's actually a problem so 200"
7472000,7482560," uh yeah i think like around like this was actually optimal right this one like 50 and it can go down"
7482560,7490000," isn't that cool things pretty cool"
7490000,7500240," uh did anyone see that uh i don't know but yeah all right so that's basically everything what i wanted"
7500240,7506800," to do in terms of like meta programming and jive right i wanted to try i know there is a module that"
7506800,7514560," does that way better and stuff like that but i just wanted to run things i'm sorry all right so i guess"
7514560,7518880," that's it for today thanks everyone who's watching right now i really appreciate that"
7519600,7527040," have a good one and i see you all uh next time right i see you next time love you"
