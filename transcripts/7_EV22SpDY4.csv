800,7200," the following is my recreation programming session where i checked two variants of basic"
7200,15040," pure basic and free basic pure basic is a paid proprietary system which has a free demo on free"
15040,21040," basic is completely free and open source uh originally i wanted to take a look only at pure"
21040,27040," basic because i downloaded the demo before uh the stream i checked some of the examples and it looked"
27040,33760," kind of cool uh and and stream worthy so i wanted to stream it but when i went about streaming it on"
33760,40320," the stream i encountered some technical problems that may be a little bit upset and i've said some"
40320,46080," emotional things that i should have not said so i would like to preemptively apologize to the pure"
46080,50960," basic developers i'm still not gonna give you a single fucking cent but at the same time i should"
50960,56960," have not said emotional things i've said so for the first 30 minutes i was fighting with pure basic"
57600,61680," i didn't want to cut out those 30 minutes because they're kind of part of the story"
61680,67280," and then whenever i was about to give up a chat suggested to take a look at free basic and i tried"
67280,73680," it and it went really well uh so since i'm not going to be cutting out any of the of the stuff i actually"
73680,80160," left some um timestamps right if you want to skip the first 30 minutes um you just go to the description"
80160,86400," there should be timestamp there enjoy the session hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational"
86400,94080," programming session with mr azozing so uh recently on our discord server somebody shared this very"
94080,100640," interesting thing um it's called pure basic right it's not really the original basic or not even"
100640,107360," like a visual basic it's a variant of basic so it's described as a modern basic programming language the"
107360,113040," key feature of pure basic are portability so it works on windows uh linux mac os and raspberry pi"
113040,119600," raspberry pi apparently uh the production uh of very fast and optimized native 32 bits and 64 bits"
119600,124960," executable and of course the very simple basic language syntax so i suppose that kind of implies"
124960,133600," that it's a like a dialect of basic and i tried it out and i got surprised by how it just worked out of the"
133600,140000," box on my machine so and that brought me to put it on my to-do and eventually do a stream on this uh"
140000,147200," it listened i think unfortunately it's closed sourced and paid unfortunately uh right and it's actually"
147200,152320," kind of expensive um i don't know who's the target audience of these things so let's actually take a look"
152320,160560," at the prices uh single year 79 79 euros for a single user uh and it's not open source and it's basic and"
160560,167360," it's just like who's the target audience of this thing um some sort of like a maybe educational"
167360,172640," you know organizations like schools universities or something like that yes there is the educational"
172640,179040," license and there's a company side um so i i don't really know it's it's so bizarre but it also has like a"
179040,184960," free demo uh right so it also has a free demo and by the way i'm not sponsored by them or anything i"
184960,191760," just like i found it fascinating and so here's the free demo it's kind of limited it is limited by the"
191760,197120," size of the program that you can compile right so i suppose it's like 80 handed characters or something"
197120,201760," like that but it's it's it's enough for like a small simple demos so let's actually download the"
201760,207440," debin version and let's see how it goes uh so i'm gonna go into the prop and uh we're gonna have a pure"
207440,214960," basic uh pure base pure basic in here so that will you get and uh let's actually do this kind of"
214960,221840," thing uh all right so it's very fast to download uh right and let's actually unpack this entire thing"
221840,231440," um so yeah that that was it and what do we have in here we have quite a few things so okay so here's the"
231440,238400," launch uh script uh script which actually launches compilers pure basic so the actual thing in here"
238400,250480," is located in uh here okay so can we just uh run it just to launch um okay so that didn't really work"
250480,256880," for some reason so let me actually go to the terminal super quick uh all right so let me go to the terminal"
256880,263360," and maybe i can do pure basic gtk2 okay so there's the variant of like gtk2"
263360,272640," uh while loading shade level of this uh support is kind of bizarre why maybe i should just install it then"
272640,276240," uh that that's kind of bizarre because it worked on my other account so"
277120,283360," i'm really sure what the hell is going on so let's actually search for libz uh because i'm pretty sure"
283360,294320," i have it installed don't i um libz so um i don't remember how to install libz"
296800,305200," right so because it's not a particular uh thing z lib devil probably yeah yeah exactly so i remember"
305200,312560," that there was like a problem with the naming and stuff like that uh because it's not exactly"
312560,320640," libz it's like z lib and it's just like i don't know um okay so there's a lib1g why is it called 1g though"
321840,329840," man okay so there is a libz mean gw huh that's bizarre because it worked on like it just worked"
329840,338400," and now i did did they update something uh right so libz also no one is the lib weird it can't find it"
338400,344000," yeah yeah so it's it's it's kind of bizarre uh z lib okay so let's maybe try to install this thing"
344800,354960," man like it it worked i swear"
354960,371520," sure yeah i don't know man i don't know it's it's it's really weird um okay so let me let me see maybe"
371520,380000," we can take a look at ldd compiler uh pure basic jtk2 so we'll have to yeah it cannot find it cannot"
380000,391920," find all sorts of things um jtk nothing is found in here bizarre absolutely bizarre must be 1g then"
391920,400240," maybe i i don't know so it can it cannot find even lib x11 there must be something changed while"
401360,406720," yeah because the version that i okay listen listen the version that i downloaded on my other account"
406720,412160," worked perfectly they must have changed something i swear to god they must have changed something"
412160,424240," because it's just like it worked and it was finding all everything just a second give me a second"
431200,435040," i think i think i found it all right just a second"
435040,452560," basic yeah look at that okay so here's on my other account here's the downloads free basic on my other"
452560,461040," account and i do ldd pure basic gtk it finds everything it actually finds a look at like all that stuff"
461680,469920," it finds everything um it could be either they change something in this executable or maybe something"
469920,477120," with my account that could be also a possibility okay so let's actually grab whatever i have on my other"
477120,482720," account right so let's actually nuke whatever i have in here because that's kind of bizarre um right"
483360,491040," and uh so let me just do remove pure basic demo like i'm nuking this entire thing and i'm doing pure basic"
491040,502240," demo pure basic demo uh let's do like a back right so and let me copy uh home rexium download pure basic"
503040,510960," uh actually these things so tgz so i'm copying this stuff uh all right so this is going to be the latest"
510960,518320," one tower fv pure uh basic okay so i'm unpacking that thing we can even take a look at their um"
519840,527200," their sizes are different their sizes are different they modified something they literally oh my god"
527200,534880," are you freaking serious bruh um no way no"
536880,542400," it's something with my account"
542400,550000," how is that even possible uh check installing it has the commands for installing stuff"
550400,557680," but why it's you don't understand listen listen listen you don't understand it's the same machine"
557680,566640," on one account it works on another one it cannot find something no no no no it's not about installation"
566640,573440," no no no no no no no this is a very important mistake this is not about installation this is not about"
573440,582400," installation right it's something with my environment my environment is up okay i didn't expect that uh"
582400,588800," maybe this is because of team use i swear to god all of these like shell scripts yeah maybe it's ld"
588800,594800," library path maybe it's ld library path all of these like a shell scripts that uh you know you you're"
594800,600400," supposed to use to install the latest languages you know like you you go to the new language website and"
600400,606880," and they say oh just copy paste this curl thing and just run it they always add shed to your bash profiles"
606880,609120," your dot profiles and stuff like that and"
609120,612080," one of these motherfuckers probably fucked up my environment here"
612080,618080," like i swear to god like why all of the language developers treat their users like"
618080,622880," dummies incapable of installing like downloading a file and run it"
622880,624800," why it is like that"
626240,632160," like why it is like that just freaking give me an archive i know how to unpack an archive i know how"
632160,638800," to run the file don't treat me like a baby stop with all this curl bullshit like i swear to god this"
638800,642960," is the reason why developers are so dumb these days because they're treated like that"
642960,648800," right they don't learn shit they just like expect that they just copy paste one line and everything and"
648800,653360," they get it to do that i'm sorry"
653360,661440," um yeah so so barrier to entry lowered right but it's not a good thing because it's just like"
661440,664080," now we have a shitty software because of these developers"
664080,671200," anyways let's try to figure out i'm sorry i like i hope this term is not going to get into"
671200,675360," troubleshooting the like how to run pure basic because that would be dumb"
676000,682320," uh okay so maybe it's because of the team use maybe because of of the team use so if i try to"
682320,695840," uh go to the prop pure basic uh pure basic demo uh macad underscore pure basic demo and uh what do we have"
695840,702800," in here what do we have in here so it's a compile pure basic gtk ldd still doesn't work"
705360,713840," and it's the same machine and you just can't run it i just i just can't run it and just can't find any"
713840,722880," of these things i have no idea so is this something with my echo ld library pass library pad i i'm not"
722880,731440," even i don't even have it set up uh so it's ubuntu okay so people are saying that maybe it's because of the"
731440,739440," debian ubuntu you don't understand guys you don't understand i again i'm repeating it again the same"
739440,746000," thing works on this machine already from a different account it works already on this machine from a"
746000,751440," different account how look i don't know how to explain that it's just like it works already on this machine"
751440,758560," something with the with the account i i don't know it just maybe cannot find all of this libraries"
758560,764640," like i don't freaking know so annoying so freaking annoying anyway let's try to remove some of this"
764640,772000," stuff um i think there is a debian bug that a user does not get event correctly try source etc profile but"
772000,780240," etc profile is a global thing so that means that it wouldn't work on the other user but it works on"
780240,786240," one user and doesn't work on another user so but etc profile is not a user specific it's a global thing"
786240,796960," isn't it um i think right so it doesn't make any sense it doesn't make any sense um okay so everything"
796960,802320," something again something with my account something with uh with this environment and i don't really"
802320,810240," know what uh exactly um how how can i troubleshoot that right so ld library path is not set up uh is"
810240,816480," is it it's not set up ld library path is not set up um so is it set up for rexium let's actually find out"
816480,818800," okay"
818800,827360," so echo ld library path ld library path is not set up for rexium item"
827360,832800," um so if there is no ld library path how else do they find it um"
832800,839920," how else do you find it if it's not ld library path so people say okay so we can take a look at"
839920,845040," uh etc profile uh we can take a look at the etc profile there is a lot of in here"
845040,851040," and there is like 34 lines i'm not sure if i want to show them all um but yeah"
851040,864480," uh all right so um okay okay okay okay so what if i where is all of this stuff located"
865280,871280," where is all of this stuff located so maybe if i log into rexium just a sec"
871280,880720," okay and then i go to pure basic"
884000,895920," ldd pure basic gtk2 all right so the thing about all of these things is that they are located in"
895920,897280," lib"
897280,899920," oh"
899920,913120," that is that one is weird all right so i do have this thing i do have this thing right it is it is having"
913120,922960," something so it even has so files right so okay uh we can go and uh so pure basic"
922960,935120," ld library path all right so it's just like liba what was that uh x86 64 and uh compiler"
936080,942640," uh uh why don't you know why don't you auto complete okay so how do i do that compiler"
942640,951920," huh ah i'm i'm not in the right place okay so i'm already starting panicking so compiler a pure gtk"
953760,966080," uh-huh elf class 64. okay so what if i just run this is it broken or something um"
966080,975760," so check if your experts on rexium has something with your experts what is my experts i don't understand"
975760,985840," what is my experts what is my experts what is experts um okay so this and this one works fine i'm so annoyed"
985840,990400," i'm so freaking annoyed that it's like that like what the is going on"
991120,995840," uh check the elf class of the compiler binary elf class"
995840,1010320," um exports okay there's no experts there's export is it going to show some sensitive information i"
1010320,1021040," really don't like that it's it's it is like that"
1021040,1027920," you're serious do not do that for fuck's sake"
1038000,1042320," i swear to god people you're fucking debated me oh my god"
1042320,1050320," uh it doesn't seem to be that much"
1050320,1060880," uh frankly try 64 bit version but this is exactly what i'm doing wait it is okay"
1065520,1072160," okay so it is 32 bit version and i think oh my god i just wasted a bunch of time"
1072160,1081920," all right so let's try ubuntu or something oh my god it's so it's it like i didn't see that it's"
1081920,1091520," okay minus to the developers of this website just specify the amount of bits directly 32 bits 64 bits"
1091520,1100640," none of that like it's so easy to make a mistake this is so bad this is bad look at this look at this"
1100640,1102480," motherfuckers they did that for windows"
1102480,1105520," they did"
1105520,1108160," fucking do that for linux as well"
1108160,1113280," i'm not paying to you by the way i'm not paying to you"
1115920,1116640," jesus"
1116640,1124560," terrible 10 out of 10"
1124560,1137040," freaking it's because it's it messes up with your visual perception right this notation like i know"
1137040,1143760," that exit is like yeah i know i already run into this problem before and that's why i'm mad that's why i'm"
1143760,1148640," mad because this notation messes up with your visual perception you cannot easily detect that oh it's"
1148640,1154880," a 32 bit and this is why you explicitly put that but for for linux apparently it right so"
1154880,1164000," anyways i'm sorry uh so i swear to god if it's not going to work uh here as well but why does it work on my"
1164000,1175120," what is it work on my other account it worked on my other account so it doesn't really explain"
1175120,1183760," shit so i don't know uh right so compiler pure basic jtk2 uh yeah and now it works and it actually you"
1184800,1194800," and wait wait but i just copied this stuff from my other account did i did i do something incorrectly"
1194800,1201600," i i don't know uh but anyway pure basic jtk"
1208560,1217120," man i'm so mad i'm so mad i'm so mad that i didn't download the right version right away"
1217120,1226480," i'm and i wasted a bunch of time because of that this is like infuriating like whoever made this"
1226480,1235600," website you seriously you edit 32-bit 64-bit for uh windows you edit that for raspberry pi you didn't"
1235600,1237360," add that for linux you"
1237360,1246080," that's that's everything i have to say anyways so this is basically the environment right and um"
1246080,1250320," yeah um so there is a bunch of examples in here so it's actually like"
1250320,1257760," yeah and there is a 3d examples right look at that um we can take a look at i don't even know in which"
1257760,1264560," order to look at them uh all right so there is a particle all right so let's take a look at this thing"
1264560,1272560," so it's going to be 3d um billboard uh let's take a look at that um so i don't like the um"
1274240,1282160," uh the color theme in here i really don't like the color theme in here uh so can i how like uh"
1282160,1291840," configure that configure tools uh form the form designer that is actually kind of cool um"
1291840,1301360," i don't see edit preferences where are the preferences file finally jesus christ preferences"
1301360,1312160," editor editor coloring wait don't you have like okay so there are some predefined uh themes dark mode apply"
1312160,1325360," oh we can have a hacker mode holy we can have a hacker mode holy okay so uh editing so let let me see"
1325360,1333280," select a font i really want to use that so can i have just a isefka yo yeah here it is i can have isefka"
1333280,1342400," uh can i have like a regular isefka please not not all of that uh so medium it's uses thin but maybe"
1342400,1351920," that's fine right no thin like thin looks like uh right extra light light uh regular yeah so i want to have"
1351920,1361360," regular okay now we're for look at that look at that choice of mine in front of how about 22. yeah so"
1361360,1370320," maybe in terms of coloring i could so there's a gray style nah it's not it's not great monakai monakai"
1370320,1376960," yeah on angry fruit salads angry fruit salad so this is actually a good so let's actually use angry fruit so"
1376960,1386160," black style that's too much php extended all right that's pretty cool uh but i think we're gonna go"
1386160,1392560," with the angry fruit salad so this is how john blow actually called this thing so yeah there we go so"
1392560,1397840," you you can customize this thing and it's actually pretty good uh right so it's pretty cool it looks like"
1397840,1409280," basic uh right so we can now try to maybe run it uh compile them so compile and run so it's f5 and uh"
1409280,1410960," file not found"
1410960,1419920," good one uh so maybe this is not what we're supposed to use then um okay so"
1421680,1426080," what else can we have in here uh examples maybe sources"
1426080,1432640," i know let's find some interesting stuff"
1432640,1444560," so 3d look why doesn't it work entity light okay so what if i try to do that thing uh and if we do f5"
1445760,1454480," i feel like okay i feel like i'm maybe just running it not from a correct place yeah so the path is"
1454480,1457120," fucked up all right it's trying to"
1457120,1461600," uh so examples"
1461600,1464880," maybe i should have actually just"
1464880,1471200," yeah so the the working director is not set up correctly so that's probably what is going on in here"
1471200,1477360," all right so let me try to maybe go in here uh right so let's actually try to go in here and if i do"
1477360,1484800," launch right so i just did the launch uh so this is a free version by the way right so uh look at the"
1484800,1492240," examples for for test programs uh code size limitation is 800 line not characters mind you lines"
1492240,1497760," can you have several statements on a single line in basic does anybody know"
1500400,1505920," can you have several statements ready brown on pure pure basic no not really i think they have their"
1505920,1512960," own graphical thing um i think they have their own graphical thing so it doesn't really matter"
1512960,1524400," uh so file again it worked on my other account like i wouldn't start this stream if this thing was not"
1524400,1530080," working it worked marvelously on my ad account now it doesn't work anymore"
1530400,1537840," oh i'm so disappointed like i'm i'm so mad because when i look at this thing it looked"
1537840,1542000," like a perfect thing to stream because it just worked and it was cool and"
1542000,1545360," shit now it doesn't work for whatever freaking reason"
1545360,1549680," oh i'm so mad it's insane"
1553280,1557760," so it's something with the working directory right so now i have to troubleshoot all that"
1557760,1564800," i don't know why uh right so and i kind of understand the reason right so it's just like um"
1564800,1575680," yeah so we already are kind of inside of this thing maybe i should have actually opened uh like a project or"
1575680,1585040," something i don't know man like open um so pure basic here's the examples there's some sources okay"
1585040,1590720," so there's arithmetics uh so this is the basic arithmetics that you can have in here if i try to"
1590720,1602080," run it uh right so is it right so it didn't even print properly for whatever reason uh adjust the path"
1602080,1610320," with the constant to have the deeper folder what constant that's not a helpful it seems to do i i know"
1610320,1617280," no this is not a helpful message i understand the problem i don't know where exactly i have to"
1617280,1626160," adjust things oh you mean in the source code uh okay um so all right i'm i'm i'm so i'm so"
1626160,1634160," disappointed and mad at the same time it's it's insane um all right so we can try to"
1634160,1640480," simply remove that so what's the comments yeah the comment is this thing i can duplicate the line look"
1640480,1647120," at that i press ctrl d right and it duplicated the line um so yeah we can try to"
1647120,1653120," do this kind of thing all right and if i do f5 uh it's assembler error"
1653120,1660960," dude i'm i'm so disappointed it it worked fine in my machine and now it doesn't work"
1660960,1671280," is it a way too basic yeah maybe maybe i just have to use it okay so there is a several"
1672160,1679280," uh let's maybe try uh let's maybe try like ubuntu 24 or maybe 2020 okay so let's give it that a try"
1679280,1687680," man it's so freaking disappoint it looked so cool and now oh stream wasted stream"
1687680,1693680," i'm i'm so i'm so i'm so i'm so mad i've never been so mad in my entire life"
1693680,1706080," wasting time on some shits swift wipes swift wipes and at least went well at the end this is"
1706080,1715520," bullshit honestly this is straight up bullshit uh so yeah okay so like i'm using like a newer kind of"
1715520,1727840," version maybe i don't freaking know so launch um all right so you got some stuff f5 all right so that's"
1727840,1735600," kind of the same problem uh all right so and then if i duplicate that stuff right if i duplicate that"
1735600,1741520," stuff uh all right so i'm gonna do that and compilation error assembly error okay"
1743920,1751520," all right so let's download some other things so i'm gonna try to do all this stuff"
1751520,1764320," your basic 3dm x66 delete pb compiler well maybe i don't know wait wait wait wait wait wait this is pure"
1764320,1777760," basic three and this one is a pure basic two uh and this is a pure just pure is it no is it just numbers or something"
1777760,1785120," man that is nasty holy okay uh so"
1788160,1795840," oh my god oh my god and people and they are asking for money i'm oh this one takes more time"
1795840,1802000," um to download so maybe that's the right one so okay it's pure basic"
1802000,1817360," okay your basics uh demo uh launch okay so the only working one is"
1818160,1824560," that one and it doesn't even work properly anymore because there is assembly error"
1824560,1836480," well i don't know like it's it's just like again it i wouldn't start this stream if it didn't work on my"
1836480,1842800," machine it worked on my machine it runs some demos something changed maybe they changed something maybe"
1842800,1847520," something is on my environment i don't freaking know but now it doesn't work so it's useless"
1848240,1852800," it's kind of useless but maybe we can look deeper into that so it's a pure basic two"
1852800,1859360," right so i i want to make the example work so i think there's throttle in me now"
1859360,1865360," i can feel the disappointment yeah it's so fucking disappointing it's it's"
1865360,1870640," fucking insane because i personally was so hyped up about it because it just works on my machine"
1870640,1875200," holy fucking shit i can do something with that and now i don't know that now it doesn't work"
1875200,1881680," anymore and so i think i was i was lucky uh all right i think i just got lucky that it worked at all"
1881680,1886480," uh right but now well i mean i understand that um"
1886480,1897040," linux is a as a platform uh but i mean like come on it couldn't be that bad uh it could be that bad"
1897040,1904640," so there's something it says an assembly error right it says an assembly error um so line not"
1904640,1909040," found yeah so that's understandable we can uh we can try to fix that"
1909040,1911360," ah"
1911360,1918800," right some combination and like it probably says something maybe it has something to do with the"
1919440,1928080," theme right so maybe the theme doesn't allow us to to display this shit properly it's just like"
1928080,1936000," assembly oh it doesn't even tell us what exactly wrong so yeah anyway um"
1939280,1945040," so thank you so much uh element0216 uh for message with uh with the message sorry things aren't working"
1945040,1949520," as expected but the demo gods have a plan as always still enjoying the stream not the less"
1949520,1955360," oh well i'm glad that you're enjoying the stream but it's just i didn't know where to go from here"
1955360,1960240," because it doesn't fucking work it's it's useless it's like literally useless and it doesn't"
1960800,1969920," i don't want to use it honestly i want to use it um so pay us to run our broken language on your machine"
1969920,1974240," oh my god"
1974240,1988080," okay can i create um like a empty project from scratch that just works is that a thing i can do um"
1988880,1996640," so new all right so maybe there's some hello world or something like i'm so disappointed it looked so"
1996640,1999280," good damn"
1999280,2004800," bcd fh"
2004800,2017440," how do you print on the screen right so i'm curious you can open window and stuff so wait event or it says"
2017440,2026640," window this is such a cool idea though can i jump to so message request so in arithmetics"
2026640,2036880," um test list how to print okay so there's a debug okay can i do debug oh it"
2036880,2040320," it has outer completion"
2042480,2049600," look at that so can i do hello world right so this is what i want and i have to save it somewhere okay"
2049600,2057760," so let's say hello pb hello pb and i'm gonna try to run it and it just doesn't even if i can run"
2057760,2060560," it couldn't even assemble things"
2061920,2068240," um try another coffee from your other account i already did that it didn't work um"
2068240,2078000," it's useless it's fucking useless all right so uh yep we're not doing basic then that was so"
2078000,2084960," fucking cool but it's just like it doesn't fucking work we need to do something else does anybody have any"
2084960,2090960," ideas on what to do next because this this is a wasted stream all right so maybe somebody has"
2090960,2097120," any ideas to look at some things uh right so i'm gonna do actually subscribe result because you know"
2097120,2103280," like i only planned uh like to do basic and it doesn't freaking work uh free basic okay so people"
2103280,2110400," say free basic well let's take a look at free basic then uh all right pure basic i'm not giving any"
2110400,2117600," fucking cent to this company i'm not giving a single cent to this company right they debated me it it would"
2117600,2126240," be okay it would be okay if it just didn't work consistently right i would download it i would see oh it"
2126240,2135040," doesn't work so i i'm not gonna stream this thing and like over no this thing fucking worked then"
2135040,2143760," something changed and now it doesn't work it fucking g baited me into streaming this is what you will not forgive"
2143760,2155520," all right so uh it's fine it's fine everything's fine so we have free basic what what the is a free"
2155520,2161920," basic free is a free open source gpl basic compiler for microsoft windows dos and linux okay that's cool"
2161920,2167760," no mac os by the way no mac os 100 free we're not paying anything okay so that means we're lowering our"
2167760,2174400," expectations um so get free basic so what do we have"
2184080,2192960," brother brother what's what's that what's that okay okay i understand that we had to lower our expectation"
2192960,2198320," but not that low like come on not that low"
2198320,2204160," anyways uh okay"
2204160,2213360," binaries for lin like i'm actually is it safe to download from this website i actually don't know"
2213360,2219600," maybe we should just build from from the source code i actually don't want to do that okay so there's"
2219600,2229120," the git bro you have a github can anybody explain to the developers of free basic how to upload binaries"
2229120,2233920," to github like if you guys didn't know you can actually upload binaries to github you don't have"
2233920,2238400," to use this awful source force shit um okay so"
2238400,2246640," all right so we have a free basic oh it looks like they figured it out okay so that's fine"
2246640,2250000," no they didn't figure that"
2250000,2252800," bro"
2260240,2273120," they did a github release in the github release they left links to sourceforge"
2273120,2286960," okay okay like i don't really want to laugh too much but maybe they just didn't know"
2286960,2290160," maybe they just didn't"
2292960,2297120," um i don't think basic programmers are okay"
2297120,2308080," and there is like and they know how to upload shed to the assets so they know that they can put binaries"
2308080,2312160," in here because by default you can also have source code and source code in here but you"
2312160,2319440," they know they can put shed in here they didn't do that consciously they uploaded that to sourceforge and"
2319440,2328160," they left the links in the release notes i'm just i'm i'm trying to like understand what kind of reasoning"
2328160,2335360," went through their head uh what kind of reasoning went through this fence so i don't know i don't"
2335360,2342800," know man anyways so uh right so let me let's just try to download that maybe okay let's go ahead"
2345360,2353520," okay it's downloading sounds something why are you doing basic for views uh okay so let's take a look"
2353520,2354080," at what we got"
2354080,2363760," so here's the free basic okay so i'm gonna go to uh probe and i can actually go even lower"
2363760,2368160," can you even hear me from here by the way i can even hear i hope you can hear me"
2370640,2377280," okay so here's the free basic uh can i open this up okay so it's not even a z bomb"
2377280,2387440," uh so i can just oh that's all the files all right so uh-huh so free oh it's down there okay"
2387440,2397440," install you want me to install it somewhere you i'm not installing it anywhere so bin"
2398320,2403760," fbc all right okay it's way it's thinking"
2403760,2412640," i guess i could i think i got hacked"
2412640,2416080," i think i just got hacked"
2418640,2424560," type type type type type in something i can't type in anything in this oh aborting v2 runtime"
2424560,2428160," yeah okay"
2428160,2440400," i guess using basic in 2024 is unsolved problem uh fbc oh"
2443360,2445680," what was it waiting for in in here"
2445680,2458000," i'm confused okay uh been fbc all right so this is what we have in here and you're supposed to just"
2458000,2463600," provide the files okay so i can work with it i can actually work with that i can actually work with that"
2464320,2465920," your portfolio has been"
2465920,2474880," fuck um all right so uh let's create main fb i'm gonna actually touch it right i'm gonna create an"
2474880,2482000," empty file so we're gonna do the legendary empty file test right so legendary empty file test you"
2482000,2486320," create an empty file and you just feed that to the compiler and see what the compiler has to say"
2487120,2491440," right so just feed it an empty file and and look at the compiler with that face"
2491440,2494240," what you're gonna do now"
2494240,2500480," are you gonna give me a reasonable error message and explain how to use your shitty language"
2500480,2504800," or you're gonna just poop with a stupid message that doesn't explain"
2504800,2514560," and that's exactly what happened it just pooped itself without explanation uh invalid command line"
2514560,2521440," option uh main fb so what the is that how am i supposed to use that wait um"
2522960,2531680," um input file yeah okay so fbc input files right i just have to provide the files and that's it um"
2531680,2542480," that's that's bizarre my friend that's bizarre okay so it didn't pass the empty file test like at all"
2542480,2551120," didn't pass the empty file but that's already better than pure basic honestly uh so bass is the source"
2551120,2560400," format okay so uh let's actually move main fb to main bass so is that what it has to be uh bass"
2560400,2568080," but i mean it still didn't pass the empty file test because it didn't explain that to me"
2568080,2572880," it didn't even say that oh i don't understand your fb files don't give me bass files"
2572880,2580480," they didn't didn't pass the empty file test right so and apparently empty file is a valid program and"
2580480,2587920," it okay so ldd main"
2587920,2593520," and it's"
2593520,2607840," okay so what we can do with this um so from pure basic we learned that there is some sort of a debug command"
2608480,2613040," can we use that thing in here right so i'm gonna just go ahead and say debug"
2613040,2621360," uh uh oh vim actually recognized that hello world okay so let's do fbc"
2621360,2634080," uh variable not declare it's it's it's saying useful error method holy it's alive it's alive it's"
2634080,2638880," saying things i can work with that just print hello okay so let's actually see"
2639680,2647280," uh right uh right so it's gonna be uh what the fbc is gonna print"
2655120,2660720," holy fbc uh"
2660720,2669520," so yeah i can work with that okay let's go let's fbc go let's fbc go so what are we having here is there"
2669520,2672080," any examples maybe maybe something something"
2672080,2683920," by the way do i have um basic mode"
2683920,2690720," basic basic save buffers i don't really have a basic mode in emacs so"
2690720,2702240," fucked fucked fuck it network pointers uh arrays allocate class cmd like okay so cmd line bass"
2702240,2711200," okay so print full command so this is how you do this thing uh okay so dim is allocating a variable"
2711200,2720560," right so you create available a variable position as integer okay so then you do loop uh-huh so this is"
2720560,2726880," how you parse command line organs okay so but then i can print so position is just a number"
2726880,2738320," can i can i do some can we generate a bunch of fibonacci numbers for example fib bass this is not the"
2738320,2750080," the one i wanted i wanted to put dot in here okay so can we do dim a as integer right so and let me"
2750080,2758000," actually split the screen and open some examples uh so i have a syntax right in front of me right so you"
2758000,2765200," can actually apparently declare several variables in here so i can do b as integer right so i can do that"
2765200,2771760," and then i can maybe assign some different things in here all right so i suppose that should be enough"
2771760,2778080," and maybe i can even build uh this thing from here uh can i deal it from here apparently i can build it"
2778080,2784400," from here but it actually built two uh successfully so yeah so this is how we can yeah so there we go"
2784400,2788800," we already have a basic environment in here it's super easy to just like iterate on this kind of thing"
2789440,2796160," uh right it's super easy to iterate so if i want to print a uh right i can say that a equal to that"
2796160,2801680," and i suppose this is some sort of a concatenation uh right so we compile that and then i can just run"
2801680,2808880," that and it says hello look at that so and well it didn't wait a freaking second i actually run the wrong"
2808880,2815120," thing i supposed to run fib yeah there we go so as you can see a is equal to zero a is equal to zero i can"
2815120,2823840," work with that brother i can work with that look at that oh my god boom uh it come look at how quickly"
2823840,2832640," it compiles wait a freaking second that is too too freaking good fbc uh fibonacci bass time"
2836800,2846000," can your rust do that can your rust do that okay can you rest do that let's find out actually i'm really"
2846000,2849520," curious can can you rest do that so man uh so"
2858720,2872720," uh yeah something is"
2888720,2905440," i just source etc profile okay so people keep telling me to do etc profile um so can i do rust c"
2905440,2910240," no i didn't help so i think uh what i have in here if i just do"
2911440,2917760," yeah so see team ux fucks up something about my environment that's for sure so let's actually get"
2917760,2924480," rid of the team ux uh right so and let's do rust c main rs and we're gonna do time"
2932160,2933440," team mucus"
2933440,2942080," well i mean it was warming up the caches and okay so let's give it a second time"
2942080,2944480," it's pretty cool"
2944480,2958400," but not as fast as you know uh just just this main that's look at that"
2961440,2964560," it just compiles faster it just compiles fast"
2964560,2975040," i'm sorry rest fans you just got destroyed by free basic that hosts binaries on sourceforge"
2975040,2983600," it happens happens anyway so"
2983600,2990000," uh so fibonacci right so we got some fibonacci shots"
2990720,2996880," uh how are we gonna be doing all of that so i suppose we also probably need uh c uh right so"
2996880,3003920," we have a b c uh and in here i suppose we need to do while do we have while uh right let's say that"
3003920,3008480," while is less uh maybe thousand how do you do while"
3012560,3017040," uh the thing is uh the thing is that i don't know basic right that's kind of the problem in here i i"
3017040,3024080," really just don't know basic uh so one of the things i can do i can actually grip um you know examples"
3024080,3031760," and i can grab specifically for while i probably want to do that case insensitively right so there's the i"
3031760,3037920," uh flag for grip it basically searches case insensitively because i'm pretty sure basic is a case"
3037920,3043760," insensitive language so that means it could be like whatever so let's actually find okay so there's a do"
3043760,3052320," while do while then uh so let me maybe this one uh let's actually take this"
3053760,3060960," uh all right that's how we do that wind i don't i don't freaking know what is wind"
3061840,3067840," honestly honestly i don't freaking know what is wind um so there's do and oh"
3067840,3076640," do people still use until uh while and"
3076640,3083040," do while uh"
3083040,3089040," i suppose only slavs will understand the joke"
3092000,3096160," um it's a very very language specific joke i really apologize for that"
3096160,3103280," so let's do let's take a look at some other things um so we can take a look at this one but i feel like um"
3103280,3105760," this one is better"
3105760,3108000," z leap"
3108000,3111280," we have z leap what the"
3111280,3112560," brother what the"
3112560,3116240," plus and let's go here"
3117280,3120000," yeah okay so it's a wild wind"
3120000,3123440," and also holy"
3123440,3123760," shit"
3123760,3128160," not just and and also"
3128160,3132800," the fact that there is a like some sort of a special keyword"
3132800,3136560," actually indicates that it has something to do with short circuiting"
3136560,3140400," right so do you guys know what is a short circuiting"
3141040,3143840," uh right oh and by the way yeah"
3143840,3148880," so essentially um the thing about uh for example"
3148880,3158960," um you know and right if you you build the truth table of and zero and zero is equal to zero"
3158960,3167120," right uh so one is going to be equal to zero one zero is going to be equal to zero and only when"
3167120,3169040," one and one is going to be equal to one"
3169040,3176480," right so essentially if any of the arguments are zero it's going to be automatically zero"
3176480,3183120," right so that means that as soon as soon as your first argument is zero it's kind of pointless to"
3183120,3188640," compute the second one so the second one is not going to be computed so and this kind of behavior"
3188640,3198560," is called short circuiting and it matters in case second argument during its computation does some"
3198560,3205280," side effects which means that if the first argument is false the side effects of the second argument are"
3205280,3212640," not going to be present right and sometimes in many languages it is used intentionally right so it is"
3212640,3218560," intentionally uh putting some sort of like side effects into the second argument and uh canceling"
3218560,3225200," out with the first argument so but many people not many people some people don't like this kind of"
3225200,3231760," thing and because of that some language designers are trying to make short circuiting explicit right"
3231760,3238080," for example it's also in ada like that or as far as i know in ada and and or they don't do short"
3238080,3242960," circuiting they compute all of the arguments right and if you want to explicitly short circuit something"
3242960,3248880," you use special keywords and this is probably one of these cases uh right so the fact that they have"
3248880,3254800," like this explicit thing and it's not just like end means that you can choose whether you can short"
3254800,3261920," circuit something or not this is just my hypothesis again i know nothing about basic right even though my"
3261920,3267680," first language was visual b66 it was so long ago i don't remember anything about that language"
3268080,3277200," right uh and also is short circuiting and is not apparently oh okay so that that makes sense it's"
3277200,3283040," it's almost like in ada right so in ada it's also like that okay so i know that it's just like uh while"
3283040,3289200," and when all right so i really appreciate examples because now if i want to search for a certain like"
3289200,3294960," construction i can just grab and see some examples without any documentation by the way so even though there is"
3294960,3304400," documentation uh right we can take a look at it so uh oh it's txt files oh look at that it's a man page"
3304400,3312640," right so that means i can do fbc one and yeah so did you guys know that if you have a man page file that"
3312640,3318400," is not in a special folder you can just do man that file and it will just open it like that so you can"
3318400,3327680," actually do that so yeah it's actually pretty pretty useful uh so and there is fdl so oh it's just like"
3327680,3334160," it's not even documentation it's just paperwork like i mean who puts lights in this in documentation for me"
3338880,3348320," um i don't know um so but anyway so fibonacci uh fibonacci bass uh while was it i think you had"
3348320,3355520," to put this kind of stuff uh and when all right and what we're doing here uh i think we want to just"
3355520,3368480," print a then we're gonna do c equal a plus b a equal b b equal c and that's about it i think so then we can just"
3368480,3371840," build this entire thing and then we can just run fibonacci"
3371840,3379040," so the cool thing about fibonacci is that it grows very fast so for example we can go up until like"
3379040,3385120," two millions or something uh right so look at that so these are the fibonacci numbers oh it actually"
3385120,3394400," decommunals yeah so i really like this language look how clean this language looks it almost feels like uh python"
3397040,3399600," this is very clean syntactically right"
3399600,3408480," do recursion now is there something special about recursion uh i'm not quite sure but is there so the"
3408480,3411760," problem with the uh recursion recursive fibonacci is that it's boring"
3411760,3418160," right so if we're going to be doing recursion it would be better to do"
3419200,3424880," something more interesting with it uh right so it would be better to do something more interesting"
3424880,3431280," okay so we did something more complicated than hello world all right so what else can we do in here"
3431280,3435760," uh what else can we do uh do some sort of a game of life or whatever"
3436560,3443440," um i guess somebody read every file in every directory on your pc uh to be fair something"
3443440,3449200," recursively would be interesting is to maybe generate a tree or maybe draw a snowflake"
3450080,3454000," right do you guys know uh like a famous"
3454000,3460400," exercise on the recursion is drawing snowflake it's like a drawing simple fractal"
3460400,3467760," uh so imagine that you have uh some stuff right some procedure that just draws"
3467760,3476160," at a particular point right so at a particular point it draws the branches of the snowflakes something like that"
3476960,3483440," uh maybe maybe something like this right so and you just have procedure that draws that"
3483440,3490880," at a particular point and then you recursively call this procedure on the ends of the branches resulting in"
3490880,3499200," something like that right and then you can actually go further and call that on these subbranches and"
3499200,3504400," this is how you generate the snowflakes it's a classical sort of exercise on recursion right if you can code"
3504400,3512880," out uh like the snowflakes drover you understand recursion you understand it really well"
3512880,3520640," it's actually a very simple exercise honestly right so it's like straight to the point it tests these"
3520640,3528880," tests your ability to uh to do recursion um so anyway um let's fucking go"
3531440,3539440," what do we have what do we have what do we have um all right um so let's take a look at the examples"
3539440,3547040," the examples i think had something other so win 32 uh since i'm not using uh team ux"
3547040,3556480," graphics okay so there's a graphics in here uh huh flame okay so let's take a look at flame"
3557760,3567120," fbgfgfx"
3567120,3573920," so you can have pointers you can specify whether you're passing by value or by reference so there's a"
3573920,3582160," by value sort of thing so you can"
3582160,3589200," okay"
3589200,3600240," that's very cool okay can i build this now um so probably wait this freaking second there's opengl sd"
3602160,3607840," there's so many things what the fuck okay so let me take a look at the opengl um"
3607840,3613520," so are those examples okay fbgfx"
3613520,3627760," opengl all right damn brother damn so you can do opengl and stuff so but it's all going through this fbgfx"
3627760,3636640," um so go to for this other great opengl tutorial so what is this website"
3636640,3643360," huh latest okay so there's some"
3643360,3648800," website for opengl so this is a website for"
3649760,3652560," i don't know what it is but it's just like some somebody's website"
3652560,3659920," um okay so this is super cool free basic is actually kind of cool that it just like has all"
3659920,3666720," these batteries in here uh but by having that i'm not be able to easily build this kind of stuff so"
3666720,3675600," for example if i just do bin fbc and i do example uh graphics right and flame if i just do that"
3676400,3684000," uh redefinition uh did it just build did it build it into uh okay so it didn't build anything into this"
3684000,3691200," folder but if i go into examples uh graphics and i search for flame"
3691200,3697680," it created an exit okay so it created an executable in the same folder where there was a source code"
3698160,3702000," uh so we can take a look at the flame uh so we can take a look at the flame and what it depends on"
3702000,3708800," it depends on everything brah you it just works how like what"
3708800,3713120," shut the fuck up"
3717120,3726160," let's go exactly oh boy uh epic yeah it's actually kind of cool so that means the other"
3726160,3732960," examples will work uh i guess so what kind of other examples do we have uh right so free type"
3732960,3739520," so charge right it's working with the fonts is not that interesting though uh let's take a look at"
3739520,3748720," opengl uh gl test oh so okay so there are some examples from near here and this is basically the"
3748720,3755840," the the website that we saw let's go to near here uh all right lessons there's different lessons okay"
3755840,3769520," lesson zero one or it's just one zero one okay that's where's the one oh it's starting from five jesus okay"
3769520,3778800," all right joe viewport you know what it means guys you know what it all means"
3780720,3788880," because look look look look listen i can do something like rg uh vim grab case insensitive radio"
3788880,3794800," no way"
3801920,3816080," it has a bindings for right fuck you wait wait wait a fucking second this bindings for okay wait"
3816080,3824720," so main uh base what what what did we do in here um so let me let me"
3826960,3836000," examples uh what was the graphics flame right so bass uh how do you include okay so can i"
3836000,3840240," include"
3840240,3849040," ray lib bi right so because that's what we had in here right so there is a ready bi"
3849040,3855360," um okay so that means i can do fbc main bass"
3856960,3859440," can't find l red liba"
3859440,3870640," oh that is very interesting um so if i try to find a file ready like anything that contains really so"
3870640,3876160," here it is actually we can take a look at this file this is a very interesting file so free basic for"
3877040,3879600," oh bro bro bro"
3879600,3885440," for those who doesn't know the latest version of ready was five right so"
3885440,3887760," oh oh brother"
3887760,3896720," brother so that means we still have an opportunity to do ray leap speed run with custom bindings and"
3896720,3902880," shits so we just need to learn how to do that so and we can actually steal some ideas from uh from"
3902880,3911520," these bindings right so okay so incol lib uh-huh so we just include a bunch of things in here"
3911520,3920320," oh this is actually does this thing imply that we are kind of like linking with the ray leap"
3921760,3929440," right it's a directive to link with the library from the source code not from the um command line but"
3929440,3936480," from the source code think about that think about that this is actually kind of interesting incol lib"
3936480,3945600," um all right because that's what's going on in here so there's some definitions uh so if not defy"
3945600,3953120," yeah so you can redefine some of these things let's take a look at begin uh maybe init window okay declare"
3953120,3959360," uh-huh uh-huh okay so that's very easy that is very fucking easy um"
3959360,3965600," but to be fair i feel like randy probably didn't change much over the version right it's still probably"
3965600,3974880," just init window uh right so while should not close a window right so essentially uh what uh like should"
3974880,3980320," wind yeah window should close and then begin drawing and drawing is probably the same like the basics of"
3980320,3986960," raydip didn't change that much all right it didn't change that much so maybe we can just download the"
3986960,3997680," raydip version 3 but then we'll have to tell um the free basic compiler where to look for those things"
3997680,4002480," right where to look for those things uh roll credits here"
4002480,4012640," all right so uh let's take a look at bim fbc and what do we have in here so i'm gonna let's"
4013440,4022400," see if there's something like minus l there's no uh like library static library okay so input files"
4022400,4026960," could be a static library you can specify a static library maybe we can just specify a static library"
4026960,4034720," to link for it that's one of the things we could do so um so what about search path do you have path"
4034720,4044560," okay so in include path okay oh the library search okay okay okay through through minus p"
4044560,4052560," through minus p through minus p uh so uh yep"
4052560,4062240," okay so i wonder if the if it's going to work with the latest raydip uh so let's do array uh san"
4062960,4069920," five raydip uh so ready five"
4069920,4075440," so let's go down"
4075440,4083440," and uh linux amd 64 that's probably what we want in here"
4085200,4088800," uh and let's do uh and let's do w get okay let's go"
4088800,4097680," uh so let's do what is it what is it ready"
4097680,4107600," okay uh if i try to do fbc main bass right as you can see it cannot find that what what if i do minus p"
4108560,4111360," uh and then i specify ray lib that"
4111360,4117520," okay"
4117520,4132160," i think it's yeah there we go it actually uh linked it's uh like dynamically which is fine we can do ld"
4132160,4139120," library path uh ld library path uh ld library path to the array lib uh right like this ldd"
4139120,4147280," uh main and it found it all right so now we can just go ahead and run this i think we didn't run"
4147280,4153200," because we didn't do anything right so that's fine uh so let's go ahead and just do bass um right"
4153760,4161040," init window how do you call things do you call them just with you know parenthesis right so i think"
4161040,4169440," that's how we do that uh hello from free basic right so hello from free i think you don't have to do"
4169440,4178640," that then we want to close the window uh like so okay so let's try to build this entire thing okay so and then"
4178640,4186560," i'll do library path we run it it actually blinked a window so the bindings from raylib3 work with raylib5"
4186560,4192240," because we're not using any new capabilities of raylib5 right so i think the api is backward compatible"
4192240,4202080," enough uh okay so that means we can do something like this all right so while um window should close"
4202640,4208240," all right so when uh begin drawing uh and"
4208240,4218320," drawing so vim got confused a little bit that's fine that is totally fine so uh fbc"
4218320,4222880," okay ld boom we got a window"
4227120,4230800," i can't close this but i can control c"
4230800,4242640," who needs c in 2024 when you have free basic"
4242640,4250640," who needs rust who needs all that overrated heptap languages"
4251520,4256720," what about wasm that's a good question actually but anyway it probably doesn't even use uh lvm because"
4256720,4262000," all projects like that usually like implement everything from scratch uh right"
4262000,4268480," we can implement something in this language so that's already kind of cool"
4268480,4273760," and all of that is for free by the way we didn't pay a single fucking euro"
4275920,4290560," for just that and it just just works so the saying saying uh right anyway so uh we can do these things"
4290560,4299280," uh so let me take a look at uh this stuff so it can remain pass uh so let's do clear uh background so"
4300880,4306240," can i just do red because that doesn't define doesn't even define the red so ray"
4306240,4313040," leap by uh do you define yeah it does define red somewhere that's a very interesting way to"
4313040,4319360," um to do that so type so in the color is probably some sort of a structure right so"
4319360,4325440," color where is it defined though and you say the type color yeah there we go here it is so that's how"
4325440,4333200," you define structures in in basic damn i kind of like basic syntactically no clear yeah unfortunately"
4333200,4342640," clitoral didn't got translated uh to to basic basic is kind of based syntactically look at that it feels"
4342640,4351120," like pascal but less noisy it is just like a less noisy pascal and it's definitely not as noisy as for"
4351120,4358000," example fortran um i'm not surprised it became popular back in the days right so because it's"
4358000,4363840," it's kind of based it's kind of a base language i really like that uh because this basic yeah exactly"
4363840,4371280," because it is in fact basic uh all righty all righty all righty so that's kind of cool"
4371280,4377440," so you you can have an innovation so you can yeah you can easily interact with c code and stuff like that"
4377440,4386720," who f**king need c um right who f**king need c if you have this s**t that's that's pretty poggers so um"
4386720,4402240," fbc and fbc let's go and ld boom red actual red but this is probably not what we want uh i can't close it for"
4402240,4408880," some reason i'm am i stupid i think i am stupid so let me try to fix that um so while not"
4408880,4418320," window should close what maybe this is why i'm kind of difficult to tell what exactly is going on in"
4418320,4424800," here uh all right all right and then ld no that's not that"
4424800,4435440," i don't understand so it's not closable for me and it's not reacting to anything oh s**t i should have"
4435440,4445760," not done that but anyway uh what was that probe um pure basic pure basic where wait"
4447520,4455680," let's see lorth oh it's a free basic it's inside of this thing okay uh so"
4455680,4463920," i think the time has come to make a small break chats i think the time has come to make a small break"
4463920,4469200," so let's make a small break and after the break we can try to write a simple maybe application or"
4469200,4474000," whatever using ready because kind of interesting language right so i'm really curious how we can"
4474720,4481760," uh make some moving things with it all right let's make some break and all right we're back uh so uh"
4481760,4488240," what i want to do in here um i want to maybe do the like a dvd logger thingy or something like that just"
4488240,4495600," like to test how you would use structures right in this specific language um so let's go to the prob"
4495600,4506320," uh free basic and uh let's open main bath uh okay so we cleaned up this entire thing and i suppose i have"
4506320,4518320," to do i forgot how it was done so let me find raylib bi so it's include free basic raylib bi okay so i want"
4518320,4528800," to just split my screen uh right so include free basic uh raylib bi uh and in here if i take a look at the red"
4528800,4535360," yeah this is basically what what we want to do in here right we do type and then this weird syntax"
4535360,4543280," right so essentially i suppose it allows us to have like a structure literals right that's what it is"
4543280,4549280," like it's it's basically structure literal so i can specify my own things in here uh can i have um"
4549280,4554880," you know hexadecimal literals i feel like i can't have hexadecimal literals but i mean it would never hurt to"
4554880,4563360," try um right so it would never hurt to try let's try to uh rebuild this entire thing yeah um rebuilding"
4563360,4571120," all of that stuff is kind of a pain in the ass so let's maybe create build so fbc right so i want to"
4571120,4583120," grab this entire stuff uh-huh right and just uh just do build sh right and in here i'm gonna just insert it"
4583120,4598000," uh set xe right and then ld library path i'm going to grab that all right so and then in here i'm gonna"
4598000,4607520," just insert that like so let's go so i'm gonna make this thing executable and uh boom uh it didn't even"
4607520,4613920," compile which is i mean expected right so this is no how not how you do hexadecimal literals we can try"
4613920,4620800," to figure out how you do hexadecimal literals by essentially just grabbing ff right because i'm"
4620800,4627440," pretty sure if the sequence of characters ff occurs anywhere in the examples it occurs in the context of"
4627440,4634560," hexadecimal literals right and that way we can figure out how you do them right so let's do grab our n ff"
4634560,4640080," within examples do we have there we go so that's how we do that you just put hash in front of them"
4640080,4650720," so i'm essentially teaching you how to extract knowledge uh from examples and not documentation"
4650720,4658080," right that's how you extract knowledge uh right and that's why i believe that examples are more"
4658080,4663360," valuable than documentation but only if you already know programming right so if you don't know what"
4663360,4666720," you're doing obviously you need some sort of documentation you need some sort of books uh"
4666720,4671280," exercises and stuff like that but if you already know programming and you just want to get up to speed"
4671280,4677520," with a certain language examples are more valuable because now you can just extract knowledge like that"
4677520,4682720," uh right so let's actually see uh if it's going to work so if i do something like main"
4683520,4689920," pass uh right so maybe i can even replace this with just that and it highlights it appropriately"
4689920,4696880," right so more or less we can now try to determine build sh and it didn't work surprisingly all right so"
4696880,4705200," okay so that's not how we do that apparently so uh all of that was bush eyes okay so let's try to"
4705200,4717040," grab for more things uh and i suppose okay so maybe this is what it is right uh width old width yeah okay"
4717040,4724720," so this is this is more likely so it's basically ampersand h for hexadecimal okay so let's actually try that"
4724720,4731200," uh all right so maybe that was the actual example so i'm going to replace this thing with ampersand"
4731840,4741520," ampersand h uh well this is not what you're supposed to that is bizarre um so is that what i have to do"
4741520,4749440," uh-huh i see so i have to put g okay so it highlights them with red and if i okay so it highlights them"
4749440,4754160," with the same color as uh you know decimal numbers right so which kind of indicates that maybe that's"
4754160,4759360," exactly what we want in here uh right if we try to build this and it works and it has the same background"
4759360,4763920," as my terminal because that's the color of the terminal right so that's pretty cool still can't"
4763920,4770240," close it for whatever reason right so i'm actually kind of kind of surprised uh okay so maybe we have"
4770240,4777520," some examples about ray leap in the examples right so let's just grab uh ray leap in here so there's"
4777520,4785600," nothing about really okay uh because i feel like i didn't even know what is going on right because"
4786640,4794080," i think that's how we do that not and you just call that unless i maybe need to do extra stuff in here"
4794080,4800080," uh all right i'm not really sure i'm not really sure so let's try to do that one more time"
4800080,4808640," yeah it does not react to anything i do so this is bizarre uh this is bizarre"
4810800,4822720," so if i grab uh rg vim grab window should close uh in how many places we do that okay so there's a win"
4822720,4826480," window should close returns a bite"
4826480,4838400," it returns a bite so it's not boolean per se maybe that's exactly what we have to and i wonder why it"
4838400,4845680," doesn't even type check properly why it doesn't type check properly so i have an idea maybe what"
4845680,4853600," we have to do in here is actually compare this thing to zero right and i'm not sure how you do the"
4853600,4861120," comparison right so while should close equal to zero i think it should just yeah so this is no expression"
4861120,4869520," found expected expression okay so how you do check for equality because just equals is an assignment"
4869520,4877280," right uh is it okay so it's it's like in pascal it's kind of interesting so how does it distinguish"
4877280,4884480," assignment and comparison then is it based on the context right is it based on the context right if"
4884480,4891360," it's in the context of the statement it's assignment right and if it's a con in the context of the"
4891360,4897200," expression it's uh actually comparison could be the this is kind of dangerous isn't it or it's kind of"
4897200,4905600," confusing but maybe not i don't know it doesn't allow assignment in if and while oh okay that's very interesting"
4905600,4917120," so anyways uh so okay so we can try to do that and it works now so yeah it's kind of i'm surprised that"
4917120,4923760," my hypothesis actually worked in here yeah i just had to do equal zero so it doesn't wait a second doesn't"
4926720,4935200," boolean it does have boolean brav brav brav brav brav that's everything i have to say to you brav brav brav"
4935200,4943120," um so let's grab this entire thing all right and i just do uh plus seventy one"
4943120,4948160," can i just return boolean"
4955440,4964560," because that's bullshit it works who wrote those bindings"
4964560,4971200," just as boolean and it just works like come on"
4971200,4984880," that would work we just had to fix it okay maybe outage maybe maybe i don't know uh so true minus one"
4984880,4986240," false is you ah"
4986240,5000640," i see so this is interesting strawberry um so true is all ones because minus one all right it with"
5000640,5005680," like two's complement and stuff like that it's actually all ones so that's probably why they're"
5005680,5007840," they're being super careful with this thing"
5007840,5010160," huh"
5010160,5013840," okay okay okay"
5013840,5022000," oh yeah well i mean okay so if there there will be any problems with all that i can bring it back"
5022000,5030240," but maybe i should bring it but whatever okay so uh main uh you know bats right so that's what we have in"
5030240,5034880," here and i suppose the next thing i want to do is i want to"
5034880,5045600," render some rectangles right draw rectangle so this is how we draw them okay uh draw rectangle"
5045600,5052240," so is there like i want to use v right so i want to use v and uh this thing"
5052240,5063920," interestingly it accepts uh vector 2 and vector 2 is this thing so that means i should be able to use the same syntax as we used here for for the type type"
5064480,5071280," uh vector 2. so the position is going to be 0 0. all right so let's actually go ahead and remove that"
5071280,5080320," so the size um let me think so this is going to be vector 2 and let's say 100 100 and the color"
5081040,5086480," let's say that the color is going to be red uh all right so the color is going to be red okay so that"
5086480,5091760," looks good in my opinion in my opinion it looks good didn't work illegal inside a compound statement"
5091760,5097840," or scoped block ah okay so just extra bush eyes in here that's fine that's fine uh okay"
5097840,5106720," so that's what we can have in here that's pretty cool uh so now i can go in here and i suppose i can now"
5107760,5114400," uh put the position somewhere into some sort of a variable we can do uh this position as uh vector 2"
5114400,5123040," all right so maybe i want to do uh build sh let's actually comment it out uh so and i just want to"
5123040,5129760," build this thing okay so yeah you're not supposed to put semicolon in here that's fine uh okay so that's"
5129760,5137280," cool uh can i by the way can i by the way just do something like this and just initialize it with"
5137280,5143920," something i can okay so that means this language is also very intuitive uh i'm really happy to see"
5143920,5150800," that so uh let's take a look at this stuff so that means i can just do something like uh like this so"
5150800,5157120," uh position so this is going to be a position uh interestingly can i have constants in here right"
5157120,5164880," so because i want to make the size of this thing a constant i know that i can have the uh defines right so i can"
5164880,5174400," define uh you know player maybe object size and it's going to be 100 but let's take a look at the ray leap"
5174400,5180800," yeah so you don't have to it's almost like a separate processor okay so that's fine so in here 100 we can"
5180800,5192720," replace 100 with object size like so though wait a second i can literally just do that where i say"
5192720,5202160," uh size all right and i can say size just this thing like so okay so that that's that's pretty cool so"
5202160,5209120," because that's literally what redip does with colors right so yeah that's literally what we're doing here"
5209120,5217760," so that's totally fine uh so that makes it pretty cool uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh so that's about it the"
5217760,5228560," thing i can do now is essentially can i access position x and just equal position x plus some sort"
5228560,5239040," of like 100 multiplied by get frame time so we have dt and the same goes for y in here is it going to work"
5239040,5245280," it does in fact compile and if i try to run this entire thing it is moving that's pretty cool"
5245280,5251280," cool uh i really like that i really freaking like that okay"
5251280,5259280," i'm getting the hang of this language um so yeah"
5259280,5267360," um"
5270560,5280400," easy peasy basic squeezy exactly eggs for connecting um so interestingly i suppose maybe we"
5280400,5288800," should have some sort of a velocity uh velocity as vector two and velocity is going to be uh let's"
5288800,5296000," actually say that we have a speed which is going to be 100 and then here is just speed right so this is"
5296000,5302400," the speed um and we're going to be modifying this entire thing so in here what i'm going to be doing"
5302400,5308480," i'm going to replace into this velocity and then i'm going to just copy paste this entire thing i'm going"
5308480,5315440," to put it in here like so right and probably we're going to do the collision thing the usual collision thing"
5316000,5324640," uh let's actually you know start from a slightly different place maybe from you know 20 20 all"
5324640,5327520," right so 20 20 like so"
5327520,5339280," okay so to be fair maybe i should use it like 16 by 9 uh you know ratio of the of the window i kind of like"
5339280,5346000," it a little bit better honestly so maybe like a screen width is going to be 16 multiplied by screen"
5346000,5354320," factor uh right so screen factor and then i'm going to define screen height which is 9 multiplied by screen"
5354320,5365120," factor as well so it has to be uh a factor factor and we let's define factor not that big screen factor is"
5365120,5370960," going to be something like 80. maybe i also need to wrap this thing in parenthesis uh all right so"
5370960,5379040," it looks a little better and now when it's 800 it's going to be screen width and this one is going to be"
5379040,5385920," screen height all right all right all right so as you can see it now it's like a full hd or something"
5385920,5392240," um you could use const is is constant thing apparently constant thing but i don't really have any examples"
5392240,5399120," on how to to use this kind of stuff right so let's actually take a look so how do you use const in uh"
5399120,5408720," in some examples right so okay okay okay okay okay so java damn bro so the constructor oh okay let's"
5408720,5420240," take a look at this thing uh i think this one is interesting uh 35 uh yeah here they are hmm okay and"
5420240,5426320," you don't even have to specify their types i suppose their types are taken as the as the values right"
5426320,5434000," so you can have classes what the is this we'll use gni to create a jvm and then call the methods whole"
5434000,5441040," you can have gni modules written in in free basic and then run them"
5444880,5450000," what the wait what the is this project can anybody tell me why is it so based"
5450000,5457040," uh bruh why this is so far why does it have so little amount of stars"
5457040,5472000," bruh people go there give them more this is awesome why is it and okay so the last change was three months ago"
5472000,5477040," so it's kind of same way uh semi abandoned not really abandoned that much but i mean it's just people are"
5477040,5484640," just like slowly developing this entire thing holy this is such an awesome project even though they're"
5484640,5490400," hosting on source forge or whatever the it is i don't really know but i mean it's it well i mean"
5492720,5498320," all these things are true it is compatible with a lot of different libraries you can just like basically"
5498320,5505120," use all of the uh you know code base of c and c plus plus very easily right so because you can interact"
5505120,5511440," with these libraries right it's it's very powerful right it's very expressive and it's 100 free unlike"
5511440,5519680," some other implementations of basic not gonna call any names just same and it works out of the box"
5519680,5528640," that's freaking awesome that is freaking fucking awesome and fast it's actually pretty fast yeah so"
5528640,5535440," it's pretty cool uh that is pretty pretty cool uh anyways so we can use const let's actually see so main"
5535440,5547760," uh bass uh all right so let's do okay so and const speed const uh and i just say equals will that compile"
5547760,5552480," it does in fact compile okay so i don't have to use defines in here this is actually kind of cool"
5552480,5559680," so that means i can just do something like uh const all right and in here we can just do equals"
5559680,5564720," equals equals equals and because of that maybe i don't need parentheses here anymore because we're"
5564720,5571920," not talking about preprocessor right so we're talking about preprocessor okay so uh that means in here i"
5571920,5582240," also can do uh const maybe i don't know so we'll see actually uh no i can't okay it's expected concise"
5582240,5591760," in const type mismatched type parameter expected constant size in const size"
5591760,5599520," huh all right that's very interesting so you can't do that right so it's better to use define for this one"
5599520,5607680," quant did they say cont or what i don't understand did they make a typo uh const size and okay so let me"
5607680,5619760," let me see const uh size um as vector two right it's almost like dim but but const right so if it is like"
5619760,5625520," that invalid data type before equals in con size"
5628560,5635040," invalid data type you can't do that so maybe you can only use like a primitive types or something"
5635040,5638720," okay that's that's very interesting"
5640560,5651360," um so i wonder um by the way i have an interesting idea so let's go back obviously define uh this one"
5651360,5659440," is type vector two all right so that is going to work all right so that's fine i'm curious if i really"
5659440,5666720," need to have type in here because uh the compiler knows what type clear background accepts maybe i don't"
5666720,5673600," have to explicitly put it in here all right so i probably have to explicitly put it in here but i"
5673600,5682240," mean that's understandable anyways anyways anyways anyways anyways anyways um so i remember we wanted"
5682240,5688720," to do like a snowflakes renderer uh maybe that's what we need to do just a snowflake renderer because we've"
5688720,5695200," done all of that like a dvd bouncing logo for so many freaking times it's kind of like a you know chore"
5695200,5697280," right so let's actually do something more interesting"
5697280,5706080," let's do like a recursive okay so all that um let's do some recursive"
5706080,5713840," uh right so but to do some recursive we need lines all right so boy it's boys may take too much time to"
5713840,5720960," do i'm sorry um so rain leap okay so i have to reopen it again it's include free basic ray"
5720960,5730960," uh really buy okay draw a line so we can draw the line uh so we only specify star position and position"
5731600,5737600," and uh the color so but we also need thickness so maybe maybe that's what i need in here"
5737600,5746240," uh right so let's just have that okay so i'm going to close this thing so start position let's say that"
5746240,5750240," the start position is going to be somewhere in the middle of the screen right so this is going to be"
5750240,5759600," vector two but that is going to be vector get screen widths all right so and divided by two but maybe i"
5759600,5770640," have to multiply it by half uh right so get screen height multiplied by half all right so uh this one"
5770640,5776560," so the end position i'm not really sure let's actually say it's going to be the left upper corner"
5776560,5784160," because just because uh just test things so the thickness is going to be one for now and the color"
5784160,5790000," is going to be red for now all right so let's try to run this entire thing and there we go so here"
5790000,5795360," is like it starts from here and it goes to the uh left upper corner which is totally fine"
5795360,5800960," so let's actually make it a little bit thicker uh not as thick as your mom but i mean a little bit"
5800960,5807360," thicker just a tiny bit thicker okay so that's a tiny bit thicker that's for sure that's for sure"
5807360,5812960," so we need to decide how many branches we need to have right so maybe for the amount of branches we're"
5812960,5820400," going to have a special constant right so uh branch counts so this is going to branch count let's actually"
5820400,5830400," put three in here for now uh and i need to actually work with math all right so i need for example pi"
5830960,5837040," can we search for pi right so i'm going to try to search for pi in the examples uh okay so there is"
5837040,5847120," an empire um but it's a kind of a in a weird place uh so there is this thing two pi all right so i'm"
5847120,5853040," curious about these things so let's take a look at it uh so this is where it is located plus 64"
5853760,5862240," uh where pi is okay so they define their own pi uh specifically for for this but i also want to"
5862240,5868080," be able to do sine and cosine right so for example costs and i also want to actually you know case"
5868080,5874960," insensitive let's do case insensitive oh this is kind of useless can we okay so what if i put open"
5874960,5884320," parent okay so here is that so we have cosine here uh so let's go there this is 100 plus 100"
5884320,5891200," uh so this is where they use sine and cosine okay so where do they get that so are you telling me that"
5891200,5900960," sine and cosine is just available in in here in in basic uh so let me try to do test bass i'm going to"
5900960,5910400," print cosine uh zero right so is it going to just work in fbc test back it does it just work okay so"
5910400,5916320," the sine and cosine is just available uh out of the box surprisingly uh but pi pi will probably have to"
5916320,5925120," define our own pi right so probably have to define our own pi uh let me see so pi fbc yeah your point"
5925120,5938320," doesn't exist uh all right so let me grab for the pi right and maybe just like copy paste this and i"
5938320,5949120," think so who said we can't do that we can we can do that uh by the way ray leap comes also with ray math"
5949760,5959680," uh can we find uh array math look at that choice my new friend look at that choice do we have pi it does"
5959680,5961600," have it it does have its own play"
5961600,5975760," okay so we there's also crt math by so there is a standard like a math stuff uh okay so that's pretty cool"
5977040,5985520," all right so let's go to main best and include uh ray math by let's see if it's compilable it is"
5985520,5993280," compilable everything's fine okay cool uh now what i want to do so we need to have the angle all right"
5993280,6003120," so can i do a branch angle which is basically two pi divided by branch count like so can i also emphasize"
6003120,6011600," that this is actually float uh is it going to work it does working it does it is twerking so now i want"
6011600,6019840," to do a little bit of a for each iteration i need to iterate each individual branch essentially so how"
6019840,6026880," you do for loops uh let's actually figure it out right so let's do grab ir four and let's go into the"
6026880,6034880," the examples uh okay so oh this is interesting the fact that you do as integer probably means that"
6034880,6042240," for construction automatically also declares the variable that is very interesting it also"
6042240,6046640," automatically declares the variable we can take a look at this entire stuff obviously uh right just"
6046640,6052080," to just to make sure that it's not it's kind of what i think it is and i think there is a dim"
6053360,6061200," pi oh this is a very interesting look at that there's a very funny way of defining so you can"
6061200,6067360," just define integers in bulk right so you do dim as integer and every name that you list afterwards"
6067360,6076560," is going to be integer and you can also spell you can you can specify ranges what is this ada style"
6076560,6088080," is the wait wait you're telling me this language is as based as ada"
6088080,6095840," us department of defense wants to know your location actually developers are free basic yeah"
6095840,6101760," us department of defense is up to you right so you're threatening them with with this language"
6102880,6110240," because it's just basically as cool as ada uh no it's arrays not well okay god damn it get"
6110240,6119600," fucking damn it anyways uh so uh yeah uh let's go ahead and just like continue"
6119600,6126400," okay that's pretty cool so that means we can do something like oh well i mean this one has to be"
6126400,6132960," integer unfortunately because we're going to be iterating integers so uh i as integer and i forgot what was"
6132960,6143840," the rest of that um just a second um just grab uh four i examples uh for integer and you just specify"
6143840,6150160," ranges from zero to blah blah blah okay so that's understandable that is totally understandable uh-huh equal"
6153200,6165920," right so zero to branch count uh one and essentially here how do you end that so is it fend bra i'm"
6165920,6171600," disappointed that you don't close four with fend because you close while with wend"
6175040,6184800," what the fuck is this it's it's it's next right really but i mean like come on it's like be consistent"
6184800,6195040," like it it must it must be fend like freaking change my mind it must be fend i'm telling you"
6197040,6208560," i it it must defend uh just a second so and yeah and in here uh 59 one more time uh 59 yeah it's it"
6208560,6218800," it even freaking next i you even have to specify this okay god damn uh anyways uh so let's go in here so"
6218800,6224240," it's i and we do that okay so i is very important because it tells you the exact branch"
6225440,6234000," so this is basically the position where we start and all of that right so and because of that"
6234000,6242960," i kind of want to have like a dim center like dim as vector 2 uh this is center right so in here"
6242960,6251280," what that means that means is that center is equal to get screen width screen width multiplied by half"
6252080,6259440," get screen height multiplied by half right so is it going to compile it doesn't compile right so what"
6259440,6266880," does it say 10 it didn't like that uh is that because i had to specify like specific value maybe"
6267760,6278080," um you know what um you know what dim center uh as vector two so i'm not gonna i forgot already what was"
6278080,6287920," the syntax uh 10 wait uh uh ah ah yeah i'm an idiot like i keep forgetting it's just reflexes i'm sorry"
6287920,6294560," whatever um so what do we have in here you can't really do that so expect it but what if i say"
6295200,6301600," this are you gonna be okay if i just do that i'm kind of disappointed that you have to like"
6301600,6306480," duplicate the type all right the compiler already knows the time but i kind of have to duplicate it"
6306480,6313840," i wonder if i can just do it like that just type oh okay okay okay okay okay wait a freaking second"
6313840,6323120," that means that means i don't have to specify these shits bruh that is awesome okay okay okay we don't"
6323120,6328400," need any of that look at that because the compiler already knows the types the compiler already knows"
6328400,6334960," the types so you can't see but i don't know how to move the view uh so i wonder if"
6334960,6340320," i can just do something about that right so essentially i can just do something like this"
6340320,6342000," and it's going to work"
6342000,6348480," ah are you telling me that"
6348480,6356320," brah you can't just move things on the next level how can i okay so apparently i need to probably move my"
6356320,6363120," camera here so you can see shit uh right so backs okay i see so it's backslash but but anyway"
6363120,6370640," um right all right all right all right so we got this kind of stuff which is poggers which is actually"
6370640,6377760," poggers and honestly what we have to do now is center so this is center"
6378640,6388480," okay okay so and we need to have another thing in here so dim branch as vector 2. so that means in here"
6388480,6401280," we need to compute this kind of stuff so this is going to be branch um so type center x center center y"
6402080,6412720," and we just do cosine of branch angle branch angle multiplied by i that's what we're doing here"
6412720,6423120," and then here plus sine branch angle multiplied by i that's what we have in here um and we also need to"
6423120,6433440," multiply by by the branch length branch length like so branch len uh and what's going to be the branch"
6433440,6441360," len that's a very interesting question so branch len uh it could be actually believe it or not the"
6441360,6446560," screen factor right so it's essentially we're going to say that it's going to be you know proportional to"
6446560,6453040," how big the screen is i think that's a good idea right so as you increase the factor it's going to also"
6453040,6457920," increase the branch length and it's going to be smaller than width and height for sure but we can"
6457920,6463840," also multiply it by something else we'll see what we can multiply it by so and then here uh all right"
6463840,6471200," so we just say branch right so let's try to rebuild center there we go so this is what i'm talking about"
6471200,6479040," um that's pretty cool so we probably want to multiply screen factor maybe it's going to be twice as big in"
6479040,6486960," here uh and to be fair i would like to factor out this thing to branch thickness right so this is going"
6486960,6495440," to be branch thickness and branch thick because uh we may also vary it as we go recursively down"
6495440,6501280," um we may also vary it like some of these things are going to be varying actually center is going to be"
6501280,6507680," varying that's for sure um branch length is going to be varying as we go down into recursion and also"
6509040,6514320," right so all of these parameters can be parameters of the recursion okay so yeah that's that's a bit"
6514320,6524080," better uh cool so this is a basic building block for the snowflake we can increase the amount of uh of"
6524080,6529280," these things how do you increase by the way i don't remember how how you increase a number in oh yeah"
6529280,6537360," remember control a and decrease control x did you guys know that you can yeah so we can have 10 of them"
6537360,6543760," all right so here's the 10 uh of these things that's pretty close i think that's pretty close"
6543760,6549120," anyways okay so let's actually figure out how you do procedures um so"
6549120,6558000," we i know that procedure starts with the keyword sub right so because it's a probably subroutine right so"
6558000,6564800," let's let's grab for uh sub so this is gonna be sub and this is gonna be examples uh examples let's go"
6564800,6571840," okay so that's how you do that uh but i would like to have some maybe prime okay so this one is so it's"
6571840,6582400," a declaration okay draw ball i like balls so let's actually take a look at them so 161 uh okay so that's"
6582400,6588400," how we do and you can have local variables and stuff okay so this is this is pretty good uh i can"
6588400,6599440," look for that so by value okay oh that's screwed up with my brain by but it's a by as you integer okay"
6599440,6607520," uh so all right do you have to do anything special for recursion by the way like in you know in a camel you"
6607520,6614000," have to mark your recursive procedures in a certain way uh but i i don't think so i don't think you need"
6614000,6623760," to do any of that anyways so let's go ahead and just move uh the this thing to a separate uh procedure"
6624320,6632400," so in here we're gonna have sub draw snowflake uh and here we're gonna accept center we're probably"
6632400,6642480," gonna pass it by value uh as vector two uh so and sub was it was it n sub i forgot was it and like"
6642480,6648640," separate thing or not separate thing anyway so we're gonna have this thing like so and this is the center"
6648640,6656080," right so this is basically the center uh honestly since this is going to be a recursive thing uh it's"
6656080,6664560," a n sub okay well i mean we can always test that a little bit later but anyway so i'm going to grab"
6664560,6669840," this entire thing and i'm going to move it in here so this is a single branch and for this branch we just do"
6669840,6678960," these things and then we just draw this entire stuff uh-huh so that also means that i can do i can"
6678960,6686080," basically do it in here draw snowflake like so and it's going to automatically just do things i can even"
6686080,6694400," do something like that so uh okay you can't see shed because now okay that's that's a little bit"
6694400,6700800," annoying that's a little bit annoying but anyways so let's see okay so that seems to be working"
6700800,6708320," that actually seems to be working that's pretty cool um yeah so let's reduce the amount of branches"
6708320,6716160," because i think 10 is too much how about five all right so in essentially chat essentially what you do"
6717680,6725920," you need to call draw snowflake uh draw snowflake for each individual branch now and that's how we do"
6725920,6732640," that but obviously if you just do it like that it is going to go recursively indefinite right so it's"
6732640,6738480," going to go recursively so you need to have some sort of a limitation in here uh we can maybe introduce"
6738480,6746320," something like um level as integer right and that forces you to specify how deep you want to go into"
6746320,6756400," recursion right let's actually go two levels deep um so in here uh what we're gonna do if um how do you"
6756400,6769360," exit out of the recursion or something uh so for example if uh level is less or equal than zero then okay"
6769360,6781520," return okay can i do that uh or something okay so i want to not run it because it's kind of"
6781520,6785040," dangerous right now because we're dealing with recursion right so we have to be super careful"
6785040,6791520," we're just trying to build okay so oh yeah it's it's a semicolon uh all right i probably have to do"
6791520,6798800," some stupid like and you like i i swear i probably yeah okay so i i guessed it i literally guessed it"
6798800,6806480," so if it's less than zero that means we have to do that uh and every time we go down in the recursion"
6806480,6812000," right so we just do draw snowflake we provide the branch but we provide the level minus one so that's"
6812000,6817840," basically it so that's the easiest thing to do in here so we can just try to replace it with one just"
6817840,6825120," to test things around uh right so let's go to build sh and allow uh running things so it's a one level"
6825120,6833440," as you can see so now if i replace this single one with two it's going to be two levels and uh let's go"
6833440,6842320," there we go but you can't really see uh because they have the same length as the original one so they"
6842320,6849600," kind of turn into and like a mush so what we have to do on each level we have to vary the length uh of"
6849600,6855360," this thing on each individual level one of the things we can do we can actually uh pass the branch"
6855360,6862560," length as the value as well uh right it looks better than i expected it's going to look even better when we"
6862560,6868640," like when we start varying things on different levels uh right so let's actually pass by volume"
6868640,6878240," uh maybe length right so length uh as i suppose single right so a single is a single precision"
6878240,6883440," float that's what it is right single precision flow so and in here as you can see we have branch length"
6883440,6890400," let's actually replace branch len with uh just length right so like this so this is the length we have in"
6890400,6903200," here um and in a draw snowflake we're gonna do branch len uh brown chlin and in here i suppose we're gonna"
6903200,6912080," do length we can cut it in half each level right that's one of the things we can do uh we can cut it in"
6912080,6918960," half uh all right so now if i try to run this entire look at that this is the basically um the thing"
6918960,6928560," so it's a two level snowflake yeah so that's how we do snowflakes this is a classical recursion"
6928560,6936640," uh exercise right so this is what we did in high school i remember when we were studying recursion right"
6936640,6942000," so the teacher actually told us like this is how you do recursion if you can do this like exercise"
6942000,6948320," you understand recursion as soon as you can do that yeah you basically like did it uh right so"
6948320,6955360," we can actually go deeper deeper we can go deeper um so let me let me do this kind of thing so"
6955360,6963760," um let's do three levels uh so this is going to be three levels there we go so that's more levels"
6965040,6972240," um we probably want to vary the thickness as well right so let's go ahead and do that uh by val"
6972240,6981280," uh thick as single all right so in the thickness here we just pass this thickness uh thick and"
6981280,6989360," every time we go down in recursion we're going to cut it in half and uh so in here we just do uh branch"
6990480,6997200," branch uh thick uh thick that's what it is so look at that that looks even better"
6997200,7007600," that just looks even better uh so we can even go like four levels deep uh yeah so now we can for"
7007600,7012880," example start increasing the amount of branches that we have in here originally uh so branch count what"
7012880,7020400," about like uh you know six right how do you do that control a you don't want to do too much this is"
7020400,7026560," this is really funny right so you you don't want to do too much uh because then it's like gonna be very"
7026560,7033040," very slow right so because it's kind of expensive computation expensive uh right so yeah there we go so"
7033040,7041200," here's a stone plate um so people asked for recursion uh i provided you recurring right classical fractal"
7041200,7046000," classical exercise uh that looks good yes that's pretty cool and that's actually pretty cool"
7046880,7053600," okay so and i can post that somewhere then as an example right so it's actually very small look at"
7053600,7063440," that example it's super small um it's super small super super super super small um interestingly"
7063440,7072720," interestingly chat we can go even very easy colleagues yeah exactly that is a very good idea my friend that is"
7072720,7078640," very good idea how can we vary the calls are we going to be working with rgbs and stuff like that i think"
7078640,7087120," working with rgbs is kind of like a pain in the ass i have an idea what if we vary hue yeah you guys know"
7087120,7093680," it you guys know it exactly so we're going to keep uh s and l the same but we're going to be varying the"
7093680,7101840," hue as we go down in the recursion i think this is a pretty cool idea right so i think it's a very"
7101840,7107440," very cool idea so let's go ahead and just try to do that uh i want to go to raylib uh so i need probably"
7107440,7118560," open it include uh free basic uh raylib bi um hs um hsv yak so coroller to hsv uh hsv"
7118560,7127760," uh-huh from hsv all right so here i just have to provide the three-dimensional vector so that's understandable"
7128480,7135360," uh all right so let me go back to the uh to here and uh where are we going to be passing"
7135360,7147600," shet all right so this is the color um so let's pass maybe hue right so this is going to be hue uh by"
7147600,7155840," value hue as a single i probably don't have to specify by value but i do do that like superstitiously because i"
7155840,7164480," don't know uh basic uh right so and then here what do we do we just do type so here we have hue"
7164480,7171600," saturation and value saturation let's say saturation is going to be uh 100 and this one is also going to"
7171600,7177040," be 100 so maybe then or later we're going to vary that uh i don't need this kind of thing okay so let"
7177040,7184240," me put that stuff in here here is red uh-huh and then i'm going to just remove that so okay cool as"
7184240,7191520," we go down in here how are we going to be uh varying the hue i suppose i can just add so it's from zero to"
7191520,7200640," 600 uh 360 so that means i can add maybe like 20 every time all right so we're just adding 20 in here"
7201440,7207520," and we're going to start with the hue equal to zero all right so let's actually see if it does anything"
7207520,7211200," that is horrible what the is that"
7211200,7222400," so maybe it's not three yeah that is death to the semicolon i well i mean i don't know why i read that"
7223040,7232560," uh okay so this is weird what the is that uh ups okay i was hoping that maybe chat knows"
7232560,7235120," something but chat doesn't know um"
7235120,7248400," why what is going on and it's also damn that is bad right so if we specify only one level okay so let's"
7248400,7256640," actually start with one level uh all right so this is one level uh and this is already wrong right so"
7256640,7259520," because does that for each individual uh-huh"
7259520,7264800," that is bizarre like what the is it doing bro"
7264800,7275440," but honestly maybe we just had to do something like color uh as color and just like equal to color to hsv"
7275440,7284480," um yeah so that should not be like a problem at all um so i don't know what's up with that"
7284480,7288800," uh so let's put a color in here"
7288800,7296240," hue is from zero to one i'm not sure honestly uh but we're talking about different version of"
7296240,7303120," of ready did color from hsv change between the versions"
7305440,7311920," uh uh right because i know that in modern well yeah that's that's bizarre okay so duplicate"
7311920,7320000," definition dim color out okay okay uh how can i call what's called cool cool"
7320000,7329200," all right so that worked uh so now if i have the two levels"
7330880,7336320," that's reasonable okay so i don't know what happened so that was bizarre"
7336320,7348880," yeah now now we're talking so that's oh it goes down so this is changing not only the hue it also"
7348880,7353120," changing the brightness and stuff like what the is this color this is should not be like this"
7354480,7362800," um that's bizarre that is actually kind of bizarre but we can try the idea of like zero right what if i add"
7362800,7363520," one in here"
7365600,7372080," uh-huh wait so this is a hue situation okay"
7372080,7375920," is it really hue"
7375920,7388560," passing shv as rgb no this is not what we're doing i think there's something wrong with this function"
7388560,7396800," honestly uh honestly uh is it hue or is it me chat i'm gonna just put the sub modes if you continue"
7396800,7405360," be like that um so color from yeah something is wrong with color from hsv uh let me take a look at the uh"
7406000,7415040," i see"
7415040,7419440," so"
7419440,7426960," yeah one of the things we can do we can actually just define our own binding so because these bindings are"
7426960,7434640," for raylib 3 and we're using raylib 5 so apparently the signature has changed between the versions"
7435600,7444240," and that kind of yeah that what's causing the bug essentially so here what we can do uh i think we"
7444240,7455200," can yeah basically just define our own thing we can say declare uh sub right and let me do the following"
7455200,7465200," thing i'm gonna just go here include free basic array lib by color from hsv uh-huh so and then here we can"
7465200,7478000," we can say uh by value by value by value uh hue as single right by value saturation as single"
7478000,7486880," by value this as single as color"
7486880,7493680," there we go so declare uh and this is function by the way right so it's supposed to return things so there's"
7493680,7499920," difference between functions and sub um you know sub routines okay so there's a value this is not what"
7499920,7508960," you're supposed to have in here uh what the fuck is that by uh value there we go so and i want to call"
7508960,7514400," it maybe something like five right so this is going to be five and"
7516320,7522160," you know what you know what because like it uses the same name as in c"
7522160,7529520," okay i'm gonna do something tricking i'm gonna just uh say"
7529520,7539200," um okay i'm gonna just like literally modify this thing directly like that"
7540800,7547280," um okay so and then here uh we do color we're gonna just do hue situation value"
7547280,7555040," like so um so that means this example is not going to be shareable uh right"
7555040,7561280," but i mean maybe maybe i should have just had my own bindings or something yeah there we go now it works"
7562080,7568080," now we're freaking talking uh but it doesn't really move through the hue very fast so what about 15."
7568080,7572640," uh now we're talking so that that moves a little bit faster uh but maybe"
7572640,7580400," what about uh like maybe 17. so yeah that's much better so now it's what moving like that"
7581760,7586160," i'm gonna be true so maybe we can have like uh five layers"
7586160,7596560," that's pretty cool i think uh what about uh seven layers"
7596560,7606000," uh okay now that's what i call vomits uh color vomit uh so it's probably yeah so"
7607120,7613920," um what's interesting is that chats you can vary amount of branches throughout the layers as well"
7613920,7621920," you can vary amount of branches so it can we go down over time so you can experiment this with"
7621920,7626800," this kind of things uh but this one is perfect honestly this one is actually kind of cool"
7626800,7634640," and scale factor yeah so all these constants that you have in here"
7634640,7639440," you can make them parameters of the recursion and you can vary them as you go down"
7639440,7643120," um and you can vary them as you go down"
7643120,7650560," how can you be made more circular by you have no branches but i mean that's going to be very slow"
7650560,7656560," you can have less branches what about three about three branch"
7658480,7664880," um it's actually kind of cool uh four it's probably gonna look very squarish yeah so four is very"
7664880,7669920," squarish uh maybe something like five probably would look yeah so this one is actually quick"
7669920,7679680," uh so yeah we tried basic today uh pure basic didn't really go as planned but free basic is pretty"
7680240,7688080," based i'm gonna say it's pretty based uh so let me take a look at all of these subs subscriptions and"
7688080,7694400," three subscriptions uh right so i'm sorry by the way enumerate for not reading your messages right away"
7694400,7703840," you actually donated a lot of these things uh right so kinchigan uh right so yeah so thank you so much uh"
7703840,7709680," enumerate uh my russian friend said once russians have a great writers or program is because it's"
7709680,7711360," so cold you're stuck in dorsal"
7711360,7721040," maybe that's the reasons uh and other reasons the thing is that a lot of famous writers were also in"
7721040,7728400," jail maybe that's also the reason anyways uh that's it for today thanks everyone who's watching me right"
7728400,7734560," now i really appreciate it have a good one and we'll see you on the next recreation programming session with"
7734560,7740080," who and mr azuzin uh love you all um"
