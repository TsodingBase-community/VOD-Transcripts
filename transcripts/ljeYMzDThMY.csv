154000,183980," Thank you."
184000,213980," Thank you."
214000,243980," Thank you."
244000,273980," Thank you."
274000,303980," Thank you."
304000,333980," Thank you."
334000,363980," Thank you."
364000,393980," Thank you."
394000,423980," Thank you."
424000,453980," Thank you."
454000,483980," Thank you."
484000,513980," Thank you."
514000,543980," Thank you."
544000,573980," Thank you."
574000,603980," Thank you."
604000,633980," Thank you."
634000,663980," Thank you."
663980,668600," Hello, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, really glad to see you all today."
668600,675620," So, today is Saturday and today I felt like programming in a very interesting language."
676280,681460," Hello, Kaku Gaming, AWS Key, Mcore69, Benny Darshan."
681460,683160," Hello, hello, hello. Welcome, everyone."
683160,684820," So, yeah."
684820,690180," So, the previous year, we were doing Advent of Code 2020."
690180,696240," You can actually find the source code for all of the solutions in here, right?"
696240,699720," So, Advent of Code of 2020 was very interesting for me"
699720,703720," because I was doing 25 different languages challenge, right?"
703720,706340," So, for each problem, I was using a different language."
706340,709600," And there were a lot of languages that I never programmed before."
709600,711940," So, I jumped into them, like, completely blindly."
711940,714840," And one of those languages was Ada."
714840,718660," And I think Ada actually fascinated me."
718660,723180," And, well, there's nothing particularly, like, special about this language,"
723180,727180," except I didn't expect it to be a good language."
727180,734900," Like, it's actually, like, a proper language of the level of C, C++, D, or Rust."
734900,738120," But it's such an old language, seriously."
738120,740320," Like, it's from 80s, I think."
740320,741380," I think it's from 80s."
741380,742340," It's a very old language."
742340,745600," But at the same time, it has a lot of modern features."
746480,749740," So, I just, like, it caught me slightly off guard"
749740,752240," that it's going to be such a good of a language,"
752240,754880," even though it has a very boomerish syntax."
754880,758600," If you know what I mean, like, very Pascal-ish one, I would even say."
758600,760140," You see, it's kind of verbose."
760140,761680," It's like 80s syntax."
762280,767140," The syntax of SQL and other boomer languages and Pascal and stuff like that."
767140,769820," Nobody actually, like, designs syntax like that anymore."
769820,773200," C style syntax took over everything."
773200,775040," And, yeah."
775040,777660," So, we don't really see this kind of stuff often."
777660,780960," And, yeah."
780960,786620," So, what I decided to do at some point is to look deeper into this language"
786620,789620," because it's a very interesting language."
789620,791580," It's, in fact, a very interesting language."
791580,793320," It has a very interesting history."
793320,796360," So, some people say, well, a lot of people say"
796360,801360," that it's a basic language for U.S. military department"
801360,803220," because it's technically easy."
803220,805600," I think it was commissioned by U.S. military"
805600,808700," to one of the French computer scientists"
808700,810160," to design a language for them"
810160,812200," so they can use that language everywhere"
812200,813420," and it would be standardized."
813420,816480," So, yeah."
816480,820480," Today, a Russian hacker is going to program in a language"
820480,822220," designed for U.S. military."
822220,825920," And let's see how many elections we're going to hack."
825920,826840," I'm joking, of course."
826840,827840," It's just a joke."
827840,829560," So, yeah."
829560,834920," Furthermore, there is an interesting framework for this language."
834920,837600," It's called AWS, believe it or not."
839060,844720," AWS is not Amazon Web Services in this particular context."
844720,847440," It's a framework for ADA"
847440,850680," and it stands for ADA Web Server."
850680,851780," Right."
851780,853760," So, and I'm not even joking."
853760,856160," It's literally called AWS, ADA Web Server."
857440,860940," So, and among the authors, there is also a Russian dude."
860940,865840," So, as you can see, Russians infiltrated, like, U.S. military long time ago."
865840,868500," So, yeah."
871100,873280," So, yeah."
873280,878100," It can do, well, it can do very, very scary stuff."
878100,881020," Like SOAP and WSDL."
881020,888200," But on top of that, it can do HTTPS and SSL and hot plug, gotcha gasm?"
888200,889840," Hot plug modules."
890000,890480," Okay, okay."
890480,892080," So, it can also do hot plug modules."
892080,896100," So, and overall, it's like a web framework."
896100,897600," I think it can do even more."
897600,901460," I think I saw, like, web sockets at some point."
901460,906940," And also, it could be, like, a web client."
906940,908360," So, yeah."
908360,911480," Let's take a look into that."
911480,913080," Oh, another interesting thing."
913080,914140," Another interesting thing."
914140,917920," Hello, sorting2OS."
917920,919400," Hello, hello, stopgaming50."
919760,920380," Hello, hello, hello."
920380,922080," All right."
922080,926160," Search libaws."
926160,931440," Keep in mind that Ada is a language designed for U.S. military."
931440,933260," And it's a really underrated language."
933260,934860," You know that many people know about it."
934860,943400," But libaws is just casually available in the repo of Debian stable."
943400,946360," It's just there being available."
948920,950000," It's really strange."
950000,957940," Like, you wouldn't expect for such unpopular, obscure languages, like, to have any kind of support for anything."
957940,958860," But it's just there."
958860,960740," It's in Debian."
960940,962380," And there's, like, other compilers."
962380,965800," And also, Ada uses a special build tool, as far as I know."
965800,968040," It's called GPR build."
968040,969560," GPR build."
969560,970660," And it's also available there."
973560,981440," And all of that is developed by a company or organization called AdaCore."
981440,990120," So AdaCore has a proper web framework, a special build tool."
990780,999080," And they have an interesting website that has a very interesting theme."
999080,1001200," It has, like, this military theme."
1002800,1009620," And once you look deeper into that, it starts to feel like somebody puts a lot of money into this shit."
1009620,1014760," Like, somebody actually, like, makes sure that it's supported properly where it's needed."
1015320,1017380," Which makes it kind of creepy, to be fair."
1017380,1019960," Like, it's really strange."
1019960,1022800," And at the same time, it's not that well-known, right?"
1022800,1024300," Like, who knows about Ada?"
1024300,1026080," Who knows about this language?"
1026080,1027020," Nobody knows about it."
1027020,1028480," But at the same time, you want to program it."
1028480,1028960," There you go."
1028960,1029900," You have all the support."
1030020,1031260," Like, all the tools is just there."
1031260,1032120," Just programming it."
1032120,1032500," No, no."
1032500,1040320," So, 20% who gets moved to a budget is going to 5-3-minute programmers."
1040320,1041420," Yes."
1041420,1045640," So, to be fair, like, it feels a little bit creepy to me for some reason."
1045640,1046900," But, yeah."
1046900,1051340," How long have you been coding?"
1051340,1053140," You can check out my FAQ."
1053140,1054680," It's actually written in FAQ."
1054680,1057700," Is Luminati a programming language is confirmed?"
1057700,1059180," Yeah, that's true."
1059880,1062940," So, from some..."
1062940,1066720," Excuse me."
1066720,1069840," Oh, here are some plots."
1069840,1070860," Welcome to the stream."
1070860,1071380," Thank you."
1071380,1072040," Thank you so much."
1072040,1073880," We're looking at the..."
1073880,1078600," What the fuck?"
1078600,1081820," I need some tea."
1081820,1084400," We're looking at US military language."
1084400,1088900," The most K-Kono language you will encounter here."
1089080,1090820," To be fair, it's not particularly K-Kono language."
1090820,1092300," It was designed by a French person."
1092300,1095580," It was literally designed by a European for US."
1099680,1101660," All right, so, let's actually pour a cup of tea."
1101660,1101720," All right, so let's actually pour a cup of tea."
1102740,1121540," I'm just thinking, how did they manage to make a French computer scientist to design a language"
1121540,1121840," for US?"
1121840,1129720," My theory is they promise that they're going to use this language to write software against UK."
1132720,1147020," Okay, so let's actually install GPR build and learn it and see how we're supposed to use it."
1147020,1152160," Because, yeah, GPR build is also developed by the same company, by the way."
1152320,1154220," It's also developed by AdaCore."
1154220,1157880," And it feels like this is like the company."
1157880,1160820," And, again, we have another Russian person in here."
1160820,1161900," Is that the same Russian?"
1161900,1165060," Is that the same Russian person?"
1165740,1169840," So, the first one, Anizimkov."
1169840,1173080," Yeah, it's the same Russian, so let's see."
1173080,1176340," What the hell is going on?"
1176340,1181880," Why Russians are developing infrastructure for US military language?"
1182420,1185140," I'm telling you, they are infiltrated, the US military."
1185140,1192340," All right, GPR build, and let's install this thing and see if it's going to be successful."
1192340,1194340," We're about to find out."
1194340,1195520," Oh, we already installed it."
1195520,1197720," I guess I was already trying to do things with it."
1197720,1201720," Okay, so I don't really have a particular goal for today."
1201720,1203980," I just want to try AWS."
1203980,1206960," So, I'm going to go to the prop folder where I prop things."
1206960,1210600," And we're going to put AdaAWS."
1210600,1215560," All right, so let's see how intuitive this tool is."
1215560,1221240," Right, so I'm all about, you know, intuitive usage of tools without reading any documentation."
1221240,1224160," So, we have a GPR build."
1224160,1225300," I'm running it."
1225300,1226100," I'm running it."
1226100,1226800," What it's going to do?"
1226800,1229140," Using project, this thing."
1229140,1232540," Okay, warning, there is no sources of language Ada in this project."
1232540,1236400," GPR build, no sources to compile."
1236400,1237740," Okay, if I do help."
1239480,1243500," Russians that were recruited by CIA are recruiting Sony now."
1243500,1244380," Probably."
1244380,1247780," Maybe this is basically their way of recruiting people, right?"
1247780,1253940," So, they just put out these languages out there and see who got debated by them and start programming"
1253940,1254280," on them."
1254280,1254980," And then, boom."
1254980,1258440," Something similar to FUBAR from Google happens."
1258440,1264740," You just programming one day and, you know, the panel just shifts up and show you, show you"
1264740,1265400," like the message."
1265400,1268640," What, what, what I work for U.S. military."
1268640,1274180," You know, so something like that has been happening to me as well."
1276980,1280740," So, what do we have?"
1280740,1282380," What kind of flags do we have?"
1282380,1289040," Can I generate like a new project?"
1289040,1295520," Okay, so you have P project and you need some sort of a GPR file, right?"
1295580,1297140," Do you need some sort of a GPR file?"
1297140,1302180," Can I do something like new?"
1302180,1303420," Uh-huh."
1303420,1305680," Unit, uh-huh."
1305680,1307900," Generate, uh-huh."
1308440,1311860," Okay, so by itself, this tool is not that intuitive."
1311860,1313700," So, you need to read documentation."
1313700,1316000," All right."
1316000,1322160," So, this is a documentation for how to build the build tool."
1322160,1326300," Documentation provided in the various formats in the docs subdirectory."
1326300,1328280," You can also find it online."
1328280,1330360," Okay, let's take a look at the online documentation."
1330360,1334900," So, building with projects."
1334900,1337560," Thinking in portals."
1338440,1344280," Okay, there's a very simple example."
1344280,1349040," And as stated above, the simple project file is sufficient."
1349040,1351280," Project build is end build."
1351280,1357320," Okay, so this is the simplest project that you can have."
1357320,1358800," Build GPR."
1358800,1361560," Project build is end build."
1361560,1362240," Cool."
1362240,1364600," Let's go ahead and put it there."
1364600,1366340," Return."
1366340,1367720," Return point."
1368440,1371280," So, it has to be build GPR."
1371280,1378300," And it feels like GPR files are actually expressed in AIDA-like language as well."
1378300,1379760," So, yeah."
1379760,1386420," Project build is end build."
1386420,1389920," So, why is it highlighting is and end?"
1390000,1390460," What kind of..."
1390460,1390840," What kind of..."
1390840,1393000," Oh, it automatically..."
1393000,1393320," Okay."
1393320,1397360," So, Vim knows GPR files."
1397360,1401000," And it recognizes GPR files as AIDA files."
1401000,1403340," Okay."
1403340,1408380," So, if I don't have any source code, will it do anything?"
1408840,1409380," So, using..."
1409380,1409600," Okay."
1409600,1412180," So, it recognizes the build GPR file."
1412180,1415120," And there is no source code of language AIDA in this project."
1415120,1416640," No sources to compile."
1416640,1417700," Okay."
1417700,1420760," So, let's actually introduce something like hello ADB."
1420760,1421440," Right?"
1421520,1423200," And let's write a simple hello world."
1423200,1425040," I forgot how to write hello world to be fair."
1425040,1433460," So, we can actually store some source code from the advent of code in here."
1433460,1437900," To the advent of code in here."
1438040,1441880," So, you probably start with importing the text IO thingy."
1441880,1452300," It's going to be use AIDA text IO and use AIDA text IO."
1452300,1452960," There we go."
1452960,1454860," Then we start with the procedure."
1454860,1455140," Right?"
1455140,1456340," So, we're going to have a procedure."
1456340,1461620," Main is and it also has a begin and end."
1461620,1462440," Right?"
1462440,1464940," And also, you have to print something."
1464940,1466400," You put line."
1466400,1467680," Put line."
1468040,1470560," And then something like hello world."
1470560,1472860," This is not how we put hello world here."
1472860,1473500," But there we go."
1473500,1478800," So, we have a source code which is essentially the, you know, hello world."
1478800,1479200," Yeah."
1479200,1480080," GPR build."
1480080,1480920," What's going to happen?"
1480920,1483000," Okay."
1483000,1485460," AIDA is undefined."
1485460,1487220," More reference follow missing."
1487220,1488560," With AIDA text IO."
1488560,1490360," File name does not match."
1490360,1492480," Unit name should be main ADB."
1492480,1493840," Okay."
1493840,1496620," So, all of these are warnings."
1496940,1497080," All right."
1497080,1498500," So, compilation phase."
1498500,1504600," Let me rename some of this stuff."
1504600,1506660," So, there's STD error and STD IO."
1506660,1512720," I like how standard for ADA is Pascal snack case."
1512720,1516060," To be fair, I really like a standard Pascal snack case."
1518140,1518880," Sue me."
1518880,1522540," Report me to Twitch for liking Pascal snack case."
1522540,1524920," All right."
1524920,1526440," So, let's remove this shit."
1526440,1528140," Sorry, Zozing."
1528140,1532640," But I had to report you for liking Pascal snack case."
1533920,1534600," All right."
1534600,1536540," So, let me rename this."
1536540,1537620," Hello, ADA."
1537620,1539520," Oh, did I put it ADA underscore?"
1539520,1541020," I don't think so."
1541020,1541520," No."
1541520,1543900," I don't think so."
1543900,1545280," So, I didn't smoke."
1545280,1547640," Main ADB."
1547640,1549240," Move main ADB."
1549700,1554140," So, yeah, yeah."
1554140,1555220," So, everything's okay."
1555220,1557880," Everything's okay."
1557880,1559120," GPR build."
1559120,1562060," Okay."
1562060,1567160," What's funny is that if I do something like Gnat make, right?"
1567160,1568040," Gnat make."
1569120,1570980," And I just build this entire thing."
1570980,1573680," It will probably build."
1573680,1578360," Add ADA."
1578360,1579960," Okay."
1579960,1581000," Where did I fuck up?"
1581000,1581860," With."
1581860,1583280," Ah."
1583280,1584120," Oh, my God."
1584120,1584440," Okay."
1584440,1584880," With."
1584880,1585680," Thank you."
1585680,1586360," Thank you so much."
1586360,1587120," All right."
1587120,1589380," So, now we can try to do GPR build."
1589380,1590460," GPR build."
1590460,1590980," And."
1590980,1593080," First try."
1593080,1594000," Got Cudder."
1594000,1594960," How about that?"
1594960,1595720," Isn't that amazing?"
1595720,1596420," Isn't that amazing?"
1596420,1598480," I think it's goddamn fucking amazing, mate."
1598900,1600260," And it didn't create an executable."
1600260,1601860," It just created an object file."
1601860,1602520," What the fuck?"
1602520,1604840," Okay."
1604840,1606560," So, how do I create an executable?"
1606560,1608940," Is there any other things I have to do here?"
1608940,1611960," Okay."
1611960,1613580," Oh, you can have a source."
1613580,1616140," Like, for source deers, use that."
1616140,1618340," You know what?"
1618340,1620120," Is there any examples?"
1620120,1622860," Like, because I don't want to read this wall of text."
1622860,1623560," Like, seriously."
1623560,1625020," Who wants to read the wall of text?"
1625020,1626420," I'm not a US military."
1626420,1627580," Show me examples."
1627580,1628000," Okay."
1628680,1630080," Just show me examples."
1630080,1632380," Ada CPP."
1632380,1633480," Okay."
1633480,1634640," So, you have SRC."
1634640,1637140," And you have other things."
1637140,1638220," Animals GPR."
1638220,1639380," Accept GPR."
1639380,1640120," Make file."
1640120,1641860," Why do you need make file if you have GPR?"
1641860,1643880," Okay."
1643880,1646540," So, basically, you use different projects."
1646540,1647360," I see."
1647360,1649380," So, animal GPR."
1649380,1652320," So, for source code, use that."
1652320,1654340," For languages, use Ada."
1654520,1656500," For main, use main ADP."
1656500,1657440," Aha."
1657440,1659060," Then you have package compiler."
1659060,1659340," Okay."
1659340,1660240," That's actually pretty cool."
1660240,1665740," And I really like that it literally just doing like a Ada, essentially, source code."
1667660,1668260," All righty."
1668260,1672860," So, can I remove some of this stuff that is not needed?"
1672860,1680360," Because I want to actually create a separate folder."
1680360,1685640," So, I'm also going to remove ALI files and O files."
1685640,1688720," Build system that is written in the same language."
1688860,1689040," Yes."
1689040,1690840," It's so fucking rare these days."
1690840,1694180," I mean, in C, C++ world, specifically."
1694180,1701640," Like, in C, C++, people don't know how to write a package manager or build system in C and C++ because they forgot how to program in these languages."
1701640,1705440," Anyway."
1705440,1709680," So, I'm going to do make SRC and we're going to move main ADP to SRC."
1709680,1711580," So, now we have that shit."
1712960,1723620," So, and apparently, project build build, um, let's actually rename build to prop, right?"
1723620,1726200," So, because I think it will make a little bit more sense."
1726200,1727860," Okay."
1727860,1734740," So, and for source deers, for source deers, use SRC."
1734740,1736320," So, here's our source deers."
1736320,1740020," We can also specify the language, right?"
1740020,1744300," For languages, use only ADA."
1744300,1745660," We're not going to have anything else."
1745660,1751180," But apparently, I can mix up ADA and C, C++, which is actually kind of cool."
1751180,1758760," So, you can add additional compiler switches and also additional specifications and whatnot."
1758760,1759240," Okay."
1759240,1768140," So, for main, for main, I suppose I'm going to use main ADP and that indicates that it will create an executable, hopefully."
1769140,1770760," And let's try to do that."
1770760,1773380," GPR build and is it compiling file name?"
1773380,1774580," Does not match the project name?"
1774580,1776360," Should be a probe GPR."
1776360,1776800," Okay."
1776800,1779800," So, it tried to compile this thing."
1779800,1782660," Then did some binding back."
1782660,1786280," And then it linked this entire thing."
1786280,1787360," Did it give me an executable?"
1787360,1788560," It did give me executable."
1788560,1789620," We have a hello world."
1789620,1791160," Build with GPR."
1791160,1793360," I have no idea what the fuck is GPR build."
1793360,1795840," But it managed to build something."
1795980,1797100," And it was actually pretty straightforward."
1797100,1799640," We just followed examples and nothing bad has happened."
1799640,1802760," Hello."
1802760,1803100," Hello."
1803100,1803320," Hello."
1803320,1803640," Hello."
1803640,1803800," Hello."
1803800,1804420," Okay."
1804420,1810580," So, we also need to move this thing to be probe GPR."
1810580,1811440," Right."
1811440,1812740," So, now it's that."
1812740,1814180," And I can do GPR build."
1814180,1817780," There we go."
1817780,1818700," Seems good."
1818700,1819520," Seems good."
1819520,1822780," But it generates way too much garbage."
1822780,1824380," Like, holy shit."
1824380,1829080," It generates all files."
1829080,1831360," Bexc files."
1831360,1831880," Ali."
1831880,1833040," stdair."
1833040,1833800," stdout."
1833800,1835980," And additional these files."
1835980,1837240," Holy shit."
1837240,1838180," Scott Def."
1838180,1839740," Evening call."
1839740,1840700," Codinpok."
1840700,1841840," Thank you."
1841840,1845040," Thank you so much for two months of Twitch Prime subscription."
1845040,1847620," And welcome to our epic Codinpok club."
1847620,1848800," Thank you so much."
1848800,1849520," Cheers."
1849520,1853100," Can we get some Codinpoks in the chat for the new subscriber?"
1853100,1853700," Thank you."
1853700,1854420," Thank you so much."
1854420,1860800," Why can't it just generate garbage in a separate directory instead of the next to the GPR files?"
1860800,1863280," I suppose because it's some sort of a boomer tool."
1863280,1869420," Or maybe it has a special switch where to put like build and stuff like that."
1870100,1885220," So, you see, for source dir, use that, maybe you can have something like for build, dir, use build, and it's probably not going to work, but it would be nice to have that."
1885380,1887740," So, I can just basically put all of that somewhere."
1887740,1891260," So, if I try to do that, it will tell me and define attribute build dir."
1891260,1891700," Okay."
1891700,1892280," That makes sense."
1893580,1897060," So, but maybe this is something that can be done."
1897060,1899580," Oh, wait a second."
1899580,1900500," I think I have an idea."
1900500,1901260," Wait a second."
1901260,1902580," I'm going to create build."
1902800,1907480," I'm going to go into the build and I'm going to do GPR build help, right?"
1907480,1914100," And if I remember correctly, oh my God, come on, minus P, right?"
1914100,1916180," It had like some sort of minus P flag."
1916180,1917840," Use project file."
1917840,1918260," Yes."
1918260,1924100," GPR build minus P and I'm going to use this file."
1924100,1925260," Is it going to work?"
1925260,1928160," And it actually didn't put any garbage."
1928160,1928440," Okay."
1928440,1930620," So, it left the garbage where it was."
1930820,1935500," I tried to run it from a different directory and still put the garbage where it was."
1935500,1938320," Like, it just does not allow you to put garbage anywhere else."
1938320,1942240," But at least we probably can git ignore it at some point somehow."
1942240,1945880," So, it's never going to go into that."
1945880,1947200," Yeah."
1947200,1948860," So, it's going to git ignore."
1948860,1951300," And let's see what garbage we need to ignore."
1951300,1956100," We need to ignore B underscore underscore, whatever that's supposed to fucking mean."
1957800,1966920," std error, std out, ali, bex, ch, and o files."
1966920,1970540," And all of that is the stuff that we don't care about."
1970540,1972580," Hopefully, that will work."
1975400,1975940," So, okay."
1975940,1977260," Cool."
1977260,1982820," Libraries."
1982820,1987520," So, because at some point we will need to link with the libraries."
1987520,1990820," So, we need to know how to actually do that."
1990820,1997200," So, library dear dynamic externally build use true."
1998200,2001600," Oh, it's just how to create libraries, not how to build with libraries."
2001600,2002160," So, okay."
2002160,2007200," So, do I have to install lws?"
2007200,2008040," Lib..."
2008040,2011920," Lib AWS."
2011920,2012420," Yes."
2012420,2013100," Lib AWS."
2013100,2013920," Let's see."
2013920,2016700," Search lib AWS."
2019200,2023820," All right."
2023820,2026980," So, we'll definitely need to install the dev version of it, right?"
2026980,2030080," So, because it will include all of the dev files and stuff like that."
2030080,2038600," Okay."
2038600,2040100," So, let's go."
2044980,2051780," I also want to start with some examples on how to use this framework."
2051780,2054520," So, there are some demos, right?"
2054520,2055360," There are some demos."
2055360,2058220," And there is a hello world demo."
2058220,2058900," Nice."
2058900,2064320," So, and from the hello world demo, we can see GPR, right?"
2064320,2065480," And GPR..."
2065480,2067660," Huh."
2067660,2070940," It doesn't even use anything special."
2070940,2073340," Oh, it just says with WS."
2073340,2073960," Hmm."
2074300,2075380," This is very interesting."
2075380,2080040," And within the file itself, what do we do?"
2080040,2081820," What is this special thing we do?"
2081820,2084880," We import AWS default, AWS server."
2084880,2086900," All right."
2086900,2089800," So, then we create an HTTP server, right?"
2089800,2092880," So, we provide the server port."
2092880,2097560," And then we start the server with the maximum amount connection of one"
2097560,2099140," with a particular callback."
2099140,2102480," And the callback is defined in a different place."
2102620,2104560," It's defined in here."
2104560,2106680," So, by the way, there is an interesting thing here."
2106680,2108820," In ADA, there are two kinds of files."
2108820,2111740," A, um, ADB and ADS."
2111740,2115280," ADB is like a C file and ADS is a header file."
2115280,2118080," So, this is like a, um, signatures."
2118080,2120960," It contains only signatures, but doesn't contain any implementations."
2121080,2122780," And this one contains the bodies."
2122780,2123760," That's why it's B."
2123760,2125920," S for signature and B for the body."
2125920,2126760," Right."
2126820,2129080," So, it's like a header and the main file, main source file."
2129080,2132380," All right."
2132380,2138540," Uh, and, uh, the callback that is called, uh, is defined somewhere here."
2138540,2139720," So, here is the callback."
2139720,2145320," Uh, so, it accepts the request, which is the other AWS status and returns the response."
2145320,2149560," Um, so, it uses some sort of program and reference to request."
2149560,2152680," I have no idea why, what is that, but we'll, we'll see."
2152680,2156060," Um, and then you just return hello."
2156840,2158720," Nice, without closed tag."
2158720,2161380," Because who fucking closes the tags in 2020, am I right?"
2161380,2162780," Uh, but yeah."
2162780,2165800," So, it's actually pretty straightforward, I would say."
2165800,2168060," Uh, it's actually pretty straightforward."
2168060,2169260," Mm-mm."
2169260,2175960," Okay, uh, so, we managed to, uh, install everything here."
2175960,2178700," And, um, let me see."
2178700,2180600," Let's go into main ADB."
2180600,2185980," And I don't really understand why we have to separate, uh, this into, like, different modules and stuff."
2186040,2190620," Because I could have this callback, uh, within a single file."
2190620,2192280," So, it doesn't really make much sense."
2192280,2193540," But anyway."
2193540,2195480," So, uh, let's go."
2195480,2198660," With AWS default, with AWS server."
2198660,2202480," Like, I, what's, this is a really bad naming for a module."
2202480,2205140," Like, you see, you see why it's bad?"
2205140,2209540," Because you look at it and you have no idea what is that supposed to mean."
2209540,2211820," Unless it's some sort of, like, ADA convention."
2211820,2216020," Maybe in ADA there is a convention where you have, like, a default module."
2216040,2216780," Within module."
2216780,2218160," And it does mean something."
2218160,2221920," But when you look at it outside, you need to import AWS default."
2221920,2224600," But, what, what are you importing?"
2224600,2226340," Like, excuse me?"
2226340,2228900," When I'm importing AWS server."
2228900,2232580," Okay, I'm importing things that are related to servers."
2232580,2233780," Okay, that makes sense."
2233780,2235060," But, what the fuck is default?"
2235060,2238500," Unless, again, it's some sort of a convention within ADA community."
2238620,2239940," But, actually, that's all."
2239940,2242760," Um, alright."
2242760,2246860," So, just my opinion on this kind of naming."
2246860,2247600," And I think it's good."
2247600,2250300," Um, alright."
2250300,2254900," With AWS default."
2255700,2260820," And, with AWS server."
2260820,2261480," Right."
2261480,2263500," We're not going to separate these files."
2263500,2264660," I don't think it makes sense."
2264660,2266080," Hmm."
2266080,2269420," So, we take positive image server port."
2269420,2272320," Ah, I think I know what it is."
2273260,2279640," Okay, so, like, this, once you have this kind of thing, it starts to make way more sense."
2279640,2283400," It basically contains default settings or something like that."
2283400,2283600," Right."
2283600,2286280," So, there is a AWS default port."
2286280,2290360," So, and these default, you know, settings are actually stored there."
2290360,2291240," So, that makes sense."
2291240,2294440," And, with a positive image, we're converting that value to a string."
2294440,2299940," So, we can, uh, we can print that value on the console and stuff like that."
2301000,2302860," Is default, is the default values?"
2302860,2303300," Probably."
2303300,2304620," I think it's just default values."
2304620,2307620," Um, that starts to make way more sense."
2307620,2308100," Alright."
2308100,2310740," Next thing."
2310740,2317560," Uh, we need to create, uh, AWS, AWS server HTTP."
2317560,2318820," So, here it is."
2318820,2320000," We created the server HTTP."
2320000,2320780," What the fuck?"
2320780,2322080," Vim."
2322080,2323760," What the fuck is going on with you?"
2323760,2326900," Hmm."
2331000,2336580," Oh, yeah, yeah."
2336580,2341300," So, we have a fresh take on the A da B in language of hell in Russian language."
2341300,2345980," Yeah, it's, like, such a fresh, fresh joke that nobody ever said before."
2345980,2347540," Uh, alright."
2347540,2349960," So, and then we have to do put, uh, line."
2349960,2357540," Now, to be fair, uh, since I used, like, use, I don't have to specify the whole, like, um, the whole thing here."
2357540,2366000," Put, uh, line and, uh, call, uh, call me on port."
2366000,2369580," Call me on port."
2369580,2373980," So, I probably want to remove this particular thing here."
2373980,2377620," Uh, call me maybe."
2377620,2378340," Ha, ha, ha."
2378340,2379300," Oh, my God."
2379300,2380900," Chat is so funny today."
2381020,2381740," Holy shit."
2381740,2382940," So many funny jokes."
2382940,2384680," Uh, positive."
2384680,2390520," Okay, so, here's an interesting thing."
2390520,2393580," Like, uh, to convert, uh, a number."
2393580,2398300," To convert a number to a string, you call an image function."
2398300,2400220," I don't know why it is called image."
2400220,2404460," Uh, because it is something that you can display on the screen."
2404460,2405940," Is that, is that why it's image?"
2405940,2408380," Uh, who knows?"
2408480,2420180," It's, it's ADA, um, AWS, AWS, default server, server port."
2420180,2421000," There we go."
2421000,2427260," Ah, and, uh, I will stop in 60 seconds."
2427260,2428040," Interesting."
2428040,2429220," So, and then you delay."
2429220,2430300," Oh, shit."
2430660,2437380," You start a server, but then it starts, like, in a separate thread, and you need to log that thread."
2437380,2438980," Huh."
2438980,2441640," How can I just wait forever?"
2441640,2443780," Is it, is it possible to just wait forever?"
2443780,2446860," That would be actually way better, in my opinion, but, yeah."
2446860,2450420," Um, so, let's actually roll with this thing."
2450420,2457380," Uh, I will, I will, uh, stop in 60 seconds."
2457580,2458120," There we go."
2458120,2459680," So, and then I'm going to put here."
2459680,2464940," Uh, it's, it's, um, okay."
2464940,2470080," Delay 60."
2470080,2471240," Okay."
2471240,2472840," Oh, delay is not a function."
2472840,2473540," Look at that."
2473540,2475800," Delay is not a function."
2475800,2480940," So, that means there's, like, some sort of, like, a built-in concurrency support."
2480940,2481900," If you know what I mean."
2481900,2483420," Built-in concurrency support."
2485420,2489420," All right."
2489420,2499140," So, um, AWS server shut down."
2499140,2501780," We're shutting down this server."
2501780,2503160," Cool."
2503160,2506660," Uh, but I also need to run it."
2506660,2509580," So, and I also need to specify this callback."
2509580,2512380," Um, it also has an access."
2513080,2514380," So, it's some sort of attribute."
2514380,2517600," And this is very interesting."
2517600,2518980," So, we'll have to learn about that."
2518980,2524200," So, there's some, a couple of AIDA features are used here that I'm not aware of."
2524200,2526280," Specifically, this access thingy."
2526280,2533540," Uh, and another one that I'm not aware of is this pragma unreferenced request."
2533700,2535940," So, it's applied to request argument."
2535940,2538320," And I'm not really sure what that means."
2538320,2539960," So, we'll have to learn that at some point."
2539960,2541720," You see, it's an educational stream."
2541720,2544780," Uh, it's an educational stream."
2544780,2545980," Mm-hmm."
2545980,2548140," Okay."
2548140,2551700," AWS."
2551700,2555040," Uh, AIDA can do OOP."
2555040,2556540," AIDA can do your mom."
2556540,2558400," Uh, uh, okay."
2558400,2561280," So, server, uh, start."
2561280,2563480," You see, I'm also funny today."
2563480,2566000," I'm also funny today."
2566000,2567440," It's a very funny joke."
2567440,2569240," Right."
2569240,2571240," Hello, world."
2573240,2575280," Uh, so, max connection."
2575280,2577040," So, yeah."
2577040,2578880," Max connection."
2578880,2581720," Uh-huh, uh-huh."
2581720,2582720," Callback."
2582720,2584620," Uh, hello, world."
2584620,2585600," Callback."
2585600,2587700," HWCB."
2587700,2589940," I don't know why they called it like that."
2589940,2592700," Uh, why is it called like that?"
2592700,2597260," HWCB."
2597260,2597940," Hmm."
2597940,2600300," I'm not gonna follow that way."
2600300,2602660," Uh, it's gonna be just called."
2602820,2603420," Hello, world."
2603420,2604200," Callback, then."
2604200,2608760," So, you see, uh, it has a keyword arguments, like in Python."
2608760,2610020," It's actually pretty cool."
2610020,2612520," Uh, hello, world."
2612520,2614760," Uh, CB."
2614760,2618320," And I suppose we need to do this access thingy that I don't really understand."
2618320,2620000," But Vim knows about it."
2620000,2622660," As you can see, it actually highlights this entire thing."
2622660,2628120," So, that means it's like a well-known thing in, in ADA that we'll have to learn at some point."
2628120,2629040," We'll see."
2629040,2629360," We'll see."
2629360,2630160," Okay."
2630280,2634460," So, as far as I know, in ADA you can define functions like here."
2634460,2634980," Right?"
2634980,2637380," So, you can just go ahead and define a new function here."
2637380,2639500," And this is where I'm gonna define my callback."
2639500,2642320," So, I'm gonna keep everything within a single file."
2642320,2643520," I think it's gonna be a little bit better."
2643920,2648500," So, I'm gonna define a function, uh, hello, world, CB."
2648500,2651440," Uh, and it's gonna accept a request."
2651440,2653100," It's gonna accept a request."
2653100,2659640," Uh, which is AWS, AWS, AWS, status data."
2659640,2661360," Which is kind of interesting."
2661540,2667640," Have we ever actually imported AWS status, status, status, state, what?"
2667640,2669620," How do you, how do you pronounce this?"
2669620,2671820," Yeah, you, you have to do these things."
2671820,2672880," You have to do these things."
2672880,2675060," Otherwise, uh, it's not gonna actually do anything."
2675060,2678500," So, you see some of the imports are defined in the signature file."
2680020,2685680," Uh, but they kind of, like, getting accessed through the body file."
2685680,2688540," So, yeah, I guess we're gonna roll with that."
2688540,2689960," I guess we're gonna just roll with that."
2689960,2692400," Um, all right."
2692400,2701480," So, and then we're gonna say that this thing returns, uh, AWS response, response data."
2701480,2702040," Right?"
2702040,2702820," Response data."
2702820,2705300," Uh, is."
2705300,2710000," Uh, and, uh, we're starting to use this."
2710020,2712380," It's pragma thingy, uh, not program, pragma."
2712380,2719660," Um, unreferenced request."
2719660,2729820," And, and, uh, I think you have to specify the name of the procedure at the end, but it's"
2729820,2730480," kind of redundant."
2730480,2732520," Like, you don't have to do that in more and other anymore."
2732520,2733460," All right."
2733460,2738860," And then we're returning, returning AWS, AWS response."
2739740,2740680," Uh, build."
2740680,2741820," All right."
2741820,2743300," So, this is the content type."
2743300,2745120," So, it has to be text HTML."
2745120,2750100," And the constant, uh, and the, the body is gonna be, uh, minus P."
2750100,2750860," Hello world."
2750860,2751240," Right?"
2751240,2752400," Hello world."
2752400,2755760," But, of course, uh, we're going to close the tag."
2755760,2756180," Right?"
2756180,2757080," We're gonna close the tag."
2757080,2760420," We're not gonna be barbarians as the author of this example."
2760420,2761380," Holy fuck."
2761380,2762040," Look at that."
2762260,2764140," This is absolutely fucking disgusting."
2764140,2766220," Uh, all right."
2766220,2768520," So, uh, we're gonna actually close the tag."
2768520,2774220," Okay."
2774220,2776660," Um, I guess, I guess that's it."
2776720,2780640," So, we have a single file and, um, yeah."
2780640,2784220," Let's see how miserably it will fail if we try to compile this."
2784220,2786680," So, it's gonna be, uh, GPR build."
2786680,2788100," And, yes."
2788100,2791060," AWS ADS not found."
2792060,2793060," It's not found."
2793060,2798640," So, you cannot just use AWS in your program and think that's, that's it."
2798640,2799700," You don't have to do anything."
2799700,2800620," You have to work with."
2800620,2803520," You have to deserve using AWS."
2803520,2805200," Yes."
2805200,2807220," So, how can we deserve that?"
2807220,2811020," As far as I know, you just have to add additional thing in the build file."
2811020,2814160," Uh, with AWS."
2814160,2819580," And, hopefully, it will pick up some stuff from the library that we installed using apt."
2819580,2820480," If you know what I mean."
2820480,2820700," Right?"
2821200,2825140," So, uh, with AWS."
2825140,2826760," There we go."
2826760,2829660," And, will that help me?"
2829660,2835200," Ah."
2835200,2840420," Subprogram must not be deeper than the access type."
2840420,2841740," Oh, shit."
2841740,2842540," That's very interesting."
2842540,2846900," So, is that the access thing that I actually put there?"
2846900,2848380," Is that the access thing?"
2848380,2850140," Oh, shit."
2850180,2852920," It didn't actually allow me to jump there for some reason."
2852920,2854380," Oh, shit."
2854380,2859800," And, it actually didn't print, doesn't print the full path to the source code."
2859800,2863520," Really?"
2863520,2865440," Fucking really?"
2865440,2869000," Like, I mean, it's located in SRC and it prints only."
2869200,2869860," Oh, my God."
2869860,2870160," Oh, my God."
2870160,2871720," Such a Pepega program."
2871720,2872920," Holy shit."
2872920,2874100," Okay."
2874100,2881720," Luckily, in CM, I can actually probably fix that by just doing something like this."
2881720,2883700," I'm going to just put SRC here."
2883700,2885420," Right."
2885540,2888300," So, and if I try to do something like that, there we go."
2888300,2897540," So, luckily, the CM was developed by, you know, a professional who knows what they're doing."
2898540,2898800," Okay."
2898800,2901560," So, there's something, like, some sort of a problem here."
2901560,2903340," You cannot just do that, right?"
2903340,2905040," You cannot just do that."
2905040,2909160," And if I try to do something like this, it's going to..."
2909160,2915600," Missing argument for parameter requests in call declared in..."
2915600,2916960," So, wait a second."
2916960,2920400," So, it has to be in access."
2920400,2926120," But what's interesting is that you cannot access this function just from here."
2926120,2929100," And you cannot move it, like, there above."
2929100,2929780," Right."
2929780,2936160," You cannot just move it there above because you can only have, like, one procedure per object."
2936160,2938860," So, I think that's the reason why you have to separate it."
2938860,2939740," End of file expected."
2939740,2942040," File can only have one compilation need."
2942040,2942300," Okay."
2942300,2944580," So, this defines several compilation needs."
2944580,2948820," So, that means we'll have to separate this function into a separate module."
2948820,2950480," And there's nothing we can do about that."
2950480,2954800," Whether we want it or not, this function has to go to a separate module."
2954800,2961580," Okay."
2961580,2963700," Does anyone have any questions so far?"
2966160,2970960," Okay."
2970960,2973060," Let's introduce this shit."
2973060,2977000," We're not going to understand why we have to separate all of this."
2977000,2979080," But I guess we're going to separate all of this."
2979080,2981660," Okay."
2981660,2984060," So, we'll have to define the signature file."
2984060,2986580," And the signature file is just basically like a header file."
2986580,2986860," Right."
2986860,2989460," Nothing particularly special."
2990460,2992400," So, it's pretty small in here."
2992400,2995120," Just like, up, up, up, up."
2995120,2995820," I'm just joking."
2995820,2996500," Of course."
2996500,3000020," So, let's go to SRC."
3000020,3004940," And it's going to be a hello world cb ads."
3004940,3006640," All right."
3006640,3009440," Response."
3009440,3011960," So, we have to import all of these things here."
3013100,3014340," All of these things here."
3014340,3016420," Package."
3016420,3017120," Hello."
3017120,3018240," World."
3018240,3019100," CB."
3019100,3024760," By the way, does anyone have any ideas what we need to develop with this framework?"
3024760,3026440," What kind of web application?"
3026440,3029280," So, do you guys know what we need to develop?"
3029440,3029780," I don't know."
3029780,3040600," Oh, maybe you should start developing a bot in Ada."
3040600,3043700," Like, Hudson Plus is developing a bot in D."
3043700,3045740," And I'm going to develop a bot in Ada."
3045740,3047040," I think it's a good idea."
3047040,3051860," So, and here we're going to accept the request."
3054100,3058820," AWS state status data."
3058820,3060080," Bot in Ada."
3060080,3060600," Yeah."
3060600,3062600," Sounds like an interesting idea, to be fair."
3062600,3071760," Return AWS response data."
3071760,3073160," Okay."
3073160,3074340," So, this is the signature."
3074340,3075660," This is the whole signature."
3075660,3079760," And let's go back into ADB."
3079760,3082040," It's going to be a lot of pain."
3082040,3083000," Worse than Haskell."
3083000,3083560," Trust me."
3083640,3085000," You already programmed in Ada."
3085000,3087780," How do you know that it's going to be a lot of pain?"
3087780,3090380," So far, I'm programming in Ada."
3090380,3092140," And I don't see that much of a pain."
3092140,3094520," So, I'm not sure what exactly you're talking about."
3094520,3102380," There is a stale project that tries to implement Doom 3 engine in Ada."
3102380,3103400," So, so what?"
3103400,3107800," I don't understand what you guys are talking about."
3107800,3113440," How does it have, how does all of that, what you say, have anything to do with my idea of using this language for a bot?"
3113440,3114000," I don't know."
3114000,3117740," Okay."
3117740,3118700," Anyway."
3118700,3120540," So, hello."
3120540,3123720," You're just saying, like, random statements that don't mean anything."
3123720,3124820," Like, okay."
3124820,3126000," It doesn't."
3126000,3126380," Oh, okay."
3126380,3126840," Thank you."
3127000,3131800," I wasn't just sure if you're trying to, you know, tell me that I shouldn't do that or something."
3131800,3132760," Like, I wasn't sure."
3134620,3134840," Okay."
3134840,3138540," And hello world."
3138540,3140080," CB."
3140080,3143040," Function."
3143040,3144280," So, here's the function."
3144280,3146020," CB request."
3146020,3152820," AWS status data returns."
3153520,3162500," AWS response data is begin and hwcb."
3162500,3164840," We don't really have to do that anymore, right?"
3164840,3165960," We don't have to do that anymore."
3165960,3172640," And we just return lws response build is going to be text."
3173420,3173820," HTML."
3173820,3179180," And I wonder, by the way, is there any, like, frameworks or libraries, not necessarily frameworks."
3179180,3182620," I mean, I sound like a zoomer."
3182620,3186460," Library that can work with JSON."
3186660,3190840," So, can we return, like, instead of text HTML, like, application JSON?"
3190840,3194720," So, and develop some sort of a REST API."
3194720,3198320," Develop a Twitter app for your schedule."
3198320,3199540," A Twitter app."
3199540,3200960," So, what is it supposed to do?"
3200960,3203520," It's supposed to tweet out when I start streaming."
3203520,3204720," Is that what it's supposed to do?"
3204720,3207420," Probably."
3207420,3208200," Maybe."
3208200,3209240," Maybe I can do that."
3209240,3211860," This is a new POG chump."
3211860,3212840," If you wrote some posts."
3212840,3214440," Welcome to the new reality."
3216400,3220260," You are stuck in a wrong universe."
3220260,3221320," Here are some posts."
3221320,3223900," Where POG chump is this."
3223900,3225000," Welcome."
3225000,3231920," Alright."
3231920,3233340," So, this is what we have here."
3233340,3243340," So, do we need to import anything else here?"
3243340,3244340," I don't think so."
3244340,3246360," What should you drink?"
3246400,3251840," I'm drinking vodka, my comrade."
3251840,3253380," Yes."
3253380,3256460," What else am I supposed to drink?"
3256460,3256900," Huh?"
3256900,3256920," Huh?"
3256920,3256960," Huh?"
3256960,3257240," Huh?"
3257240,3257300," Huh?"
3257300,3257420," Huh?"
3257420,3257420," Huh?"
3257420,3258020," Huh?"
3258020,3258500," Huh?"
3258500,3258700," Alright."
3258700,3260440," So, and in here..."
3260440,3260840," Actually..."
3260840,3262520," What are you thinking?"
3262520,3266860," What are you thinking?"
3266860,3267300," Okay."
3267300,3271860," So, where is the other file?"
3271860,3275460," So, I have to go back to hello world."
3275460,3277220," Kvass."
3277220,3284500," Imagine drinking Kvass like in the middle of winter."
3285500,3286040," Holy fuck."
3286040,3286240," Holy fuck."
3286240,3287000," Why?"
3287000,3288260," Why would you do that?"
3288260,3290000," Alright."
3290000,3292840," So, SRC..."
3292840,3293340," Is it main?"
3293340,3294380," Yes, it is main."
3294380,3296720," And I'm going to remove all of that shite."
3296720,3298740," And then I'm going to remove all of that shite."
3298740,3302480," And I'm going to do with hello world."
3303520,3305340," CB, right?"
3305340,3306880," So, hello world CB."
3306880,3311440," And I guess here we'll have to do HW."
3311440,3312660," CB."
3312660,3315900," Oh, I finally understood what HW means."
3315900,3317340," It means hello world."
3317340,3318040," Holy shit."
3318040,3322060," It took me too much time to realize what HW means."
3322060,3324640," Why didn't you just call it hello world then?"
3324640,3330040," I even choked to realize what HW means."
3330040,3333360," Like, for some reason, my brain was trying to parse it as hard."
3333460,3338480," And I was thinking, what does hardware even have anything to do with all of that?"
3338480,3340540," I guess I'm being, like, absolutely fucking prepared."
3340540,3342380," As usual, though."
3342380,3343020," As usual."
3343020,3343620," So, okay."
3343620,3346060," Let's do GPR build and see if it's going to build."
3346060,3351040," First try."
3351040,3352760," How about that?"
3352760,3354640," I just first tried this shit."
3354640,3355680," Isn't that amazing?"
3355680,3356920," I think it's goddamn amazing."
3356920,3358420," So, let me actually prepare."
3358420,3361000," And we're going to try to run it."
3361000,3365740," And we're going to do curl localhost 8080."
3366140,3368620," And we got hello world."
3368620,3369800," How about that?"
3369800,3371300," So, yeah."
3371300,3375300," And we will be able to use hello world for 60 seconds."
3375300,3377560," I might as well actually try to do something like this."
3377560,3379940," I wonder if I can do..."
3379940,3380440," Yeah, there we go."
3380440,3381660," Here's the hello world."
3381660,3385160," Here's our first hello world in ADA."
3385520,3388060," Isn't that goddamn fucking amazing?"
3388060,3391400," Let's celebrate and drink some tea."
3391400,3394140," All right."
3394140,3397840," So, is that everything you can do with ADA?"
3397840,3403460," Can we have, like, a reference guide for AWS and just see what we can do with it?"
3403460,3405620," Does it have any client support and stuff?"
3405620,3407600," Or is it only server shit?"
3408340,3410260," It feels like it's only server shit."
3410260,3413040," So, yeah, because it's in the name."
3413040,3417440," It's only in name."
3417440,3418340," So, dock."
3418340,3419060," Okay."
3419060,3421080," It does have docks, which is nice."
3421080,3422620," You can build them yourself."
3422620,3427440," But maybe there are similar docks in here."
3428480,3436540," For example, they call this GPR build docks on the official adacore.com website."
3436540,3440480," What if I go and replace this to AWS docks?"
3440480,3441640," Will it give me AWS?"
3441640,3442800," Yeah, access denied."
3442800,3444500," Thank you very much."
3444500,3444880," Okay."
3444880,3448940," So, apparently there is no, like, official docks for AWS."
3448940,3451240," And that's very interesting."
3451240,3455500," So, documentation."
3456620,3459080," Okay, document added to the WL."
3459080,3460760," Homepage."
3460760,3461600," Sources."
3461600,3462840," Printable documentation."
3462840,3464800," This is where we have to go."
3464800,3466880," Community."
3466880,3469140," It redirected to some sort of community."
3469140,3469880," What the fuck?"
3469880,3472160," All of the links here are dead."
3472160,3475640," It's all dead."
3475640,3478140," How am I supposed to use any of this shit?"
3478140,3478940," Holy fuck."
3478940,3481240," This is so sad."
3481240,3484040," All right."
3484040,3485540," We can take a look at the source code then."
3486620,3489080," So, there is the core."
3489080,3493080," There's the core."
3493080,3494560," AWS client."
3494560,3495400," Oh, shit."
3495400,3497360," I can actually do queries and stuff."
3497360,3498760," That's amazing."
3498760,3503080," I can write, like, APIs and stuff."
3503080,3504580," I like that."
3505760,3507320," I can get URLs."
3507320,3511520," Nice."
3511520,3512440," Okay."
3512440,3514360," So, maybe this is what we need to try to do."
3514360,3516640," So, AWS client."
3516640,3518040," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
3518040,3523500," So, let's try to do that instead."
3525220,3528440," Do we need to have, like, SSL support or something?"
3528440,3531100," SSL support."
3531100,3532120," I want to try the client."
3532120,3537240," Apparently, Clank can borrow GCC frontends."
3537240,3538100," Okay."
3538100,3538640," Cool."
3540740,3540960," Okay."
3540960,3542440," I'm going to make another cup of tea."
3542440,3547680," And we can try to explore the capabilities of AWS client."
3547680,3548200," Right."
3548200,3549660," So, what the client can do."
3550280,3553840," And if it works like curl, it's actually pretty pogue."
3553840,3557280," And it could be one of the components of the bot, for example."
3557280,3561640," But to have, like, a Twitch bot, we probably need some IRC support."
3561640,3565700," Is there any IDA IRC library or something like that?"
3565700,3567460," Is it even possible to have something like that?"
3567460,3568820," There's IDA ARC."
3568820,3569260," Okay."
3569260,3572580," An IDA library for creating IRC bots."
3572580,3573980," Hmm."
3573980,3575980," Okay."
3575980,3578460," Oh."
3579760,3582360," Well, okay."
3582360,3584840," That's very interesting."
3584840,3587840," That's very interesting."
3587840,3589280," So, they don't even use..."
3589280,3590780," Well, they do use GPR."
3590780,3592580," So, maybe we can look into that."
3592580,3594380," So, this could be examples."
3594380,3596920," There are different commands."
3596920,3598120," And maybe..."
3598120,3600720," To be fair, like, IRC protocol didn't really..."
3600720,3605080," Didn't really change that much for, like, nine, eight years."
3605080,3607100," So, maybe it's not that big of a deal."
3607100,3608780," I mean, yeah, I guess."
3608780,3611900," Plus, ADA is a secure language."
3611900,3618800," So, I'm pretty sure what was written, like, nine years ago is still super secure these days."
3618800,3619300," Right?"
3619300,3624760," Because, like, ADA has a very strong, like, static typing with contracts and shit like that."
3624800,3628600," So, I'm pretty sure this library is super secure and doesn't need any security updates."
3628600,3628860," Right?"
3628860,3631320," So, it's not like D, right?"
3631320,3636000," Where you can, you know, do file path injects in the time library."
3636000,3636260," Right?"
3636260,3637080," It's just ADA."
3637080,3639800," It's used in military, in U.S. military."
3640360,3643000," Something like that in U.S. military would be unacceptable."
3645120,3646360," So, yeah."
3646360,3650400," I'm sorry, because it lost."
3650400,3651940," I'm just joking."
3651940,3654880," Did they fix it already?"
3654880,3663900," Carrot, why are you talking to yourself?"
3663900,3664700," Are you okay?"
3665640,3669000," Or is it just a reminder for yourself to check it out later?"
3669000,3670800," Oh, they didn't."
3670800,3671340," Nice."
3675400,3676820," Does anyone have any questions?"
3676820,3678280," I'm making a cup of tea."
3678280,3679700," I'm just making a cup of tea."
3679700,3688020," So, until I'm done with my cup of tea, I'm not going to do anything."
3688020,3693380," It's a little bit cold in here."
3693380,3696940," I kind of want to put on some socks."
3696940,3699560," So, let's make a small break, chat."
3699560,3700600," Let's make a small break."
3700600,3702200," It's going to be, like, a two-minute break."
3702200,3706660," And after two minutes break, we're going to try to explore the client side of things."
3706660,3708160," And, yeah."
3708160,3710520," Then we will try to come up with something interesting to do."
3710520,3711880," Programming sucks."
3711880,3713040," I don't have a programming sucks."
3713040,3713480," I'm sorry."
3713480,3715480," All right."
3715480,3717020," Maybe I should buy ones."
3717020,3726520," Oh, by the way, I tried to install AIDA support for Emacs."
3726520,3728680," It actually sucks."
3728680,3730040," It doesn't work."
3731120,3732220," Here's the AIDA mode."
3732220,3733820," You can try to install it."
3733820,3736060," And it actually crashes, I think."
3736060,3738000," But maybe it's going to work on this particular machine."
3738000,3740300," Packages to install one AIDA."
3740300,3742580," Maybe it's going to work, actually."
3742580,3744260," But it didn't work on my other account."
3744260,3749880," Okay."
3749880,3750940," So, it's doing things."
3752420,3757400," I tried to install AIDA mode on my Emacs right after that stream."
3757400,3758900," And it didn't work."
3758900,3761160," Maybe they fixed it."
3761160,3762720," Maybe there was something broken there."
3762720,3764320," And at some point, they fixed something."
3764320,3766000," Like, I don't know, like, what happened."
3766000,3767600," But now it works."
3767600,3771000," And if it works now, I'm super happy."
3771200,3773720," Because I don't want to use Veeam anymore."
3773720,3774180," I'm sorry."
3774180,3776160," I'm kind of tired of using it."
3776160,3778300," So, let's go."
3778300,3779420," So, what is AWS?"
3779420,3782060," And I can go to SRC."
3782060,3784040," And if I go here."
3784040,3785080," And it doesn't work."
3785080,3785840," Look at that."
3785840,3787540," It says that it's an AIDA mode."
3787540,3789100," It's a fucking AIDA mode."
3789100,3791040," And none of the keywords are fucking highlighted."
3791040,3792560," Nice AIDA mode, by the way."
3792660,3793480," Thank you very much."
3793480,3796780," What the fuck is this?"
3796780,3797720," Are you serious?"
3797720,3801500," Excuse me."
3801500,3804300," What the fuck?"
3804300,3807540," Can you do that?"
3807540,3809400," Does it support comments?"
3809400,3810320," Well, okay."
3810320,3815540," There is this philosophy of some people."
3815540,3819740," Some people use a very minimalistic, like, highlighting."
3820160,3825140," where the only highlighting they have is the highlighting of string literals and comments."
3825140,3827300," And everything else is unhighlighted."
3827300,3831700," Because they believe this is the most important thing that you need to differentiate from."
3831700,3833500," Maybe it's one of those modes."
3833500,3834260," I have no idea."
3834260,3835380," Maybe that's what it is."
3835380,3839480," So, but, yeah."
3839480,3843720," AIDA skill build run."
3843720,3845880," Okay."
3845880,3847560," Very cool."
3847560,3849660," Thank you."
3849660,3850760," Can Yurim do that?"
3850760,3851700," I don't think it can."
3851700,3854800," Okay."
3854800,3856800," Small break."
3856800,3860560," It's going to be two minutes, I think."
3860560,3861220," Hopefully."
3861220,3863120," Hopefully it's going to be around two minutes."
3863120,3864360," All right."
3864360,3866000," It's going to be around two minutes."
3866000,3867620," And let's do Suvun."
3867620,3870120," And you guys have fun."
3870120,3879240," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3879240,3883220," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3883220,3884200," I'm going to be around two minutes."

3891360,3891940," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3891940,3892900," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3892900,3893780," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3893780,3894740," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3894740,3895180," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3895180,3895820," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3895820,3896780," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3896780,3897240," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3897240,3927220," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3927240,3929100," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3929100,3930000," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3930000,3931080," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3931080,3932000," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3932000,3933140," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3933140,3934040," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3934040,3935080," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3935080,3935680," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3935680,3936000," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3936000,3937040," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3937040,3938100," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3938100,3939100," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3939100,3940100," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3940100,3941040," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3941040,3942100," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3942100,3944100," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3944100,3946040," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3946040,3947100," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3947100,3948100," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3948100,3949980," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3957240,3973800," I'm going to be around two minutes."
3973800,3976840," Yo, what's up, epic aiders?"
3976840,3979500," Is that how you call aiders developers?"
3979500,3981380," I don't know."
3981380,3983600," But this shit sucks, by the way."
3983600,3987200," So, yeah, maybe I need to restart this entire thing."
3987200,3990300," So it's going to be src main adb."
3990300,3993000," And let's see, let's see."
3993000,3993900," No."
3993900,3996440," Oh, by the way, it was actually saying something down below."
3996440,3999040," Oh, one more time."
3999040,4002960," File mode specification error."
4002960,4004640," OK, it's broken."
4004640,4007440," It's essentially broken."
4007440,4011240," Gayle Law is continuing the gift sub they got from the anonymous user."
4011240,4012240," I have no idea what that means."
4012240,4016480," But thank you so much for making something that makes this notification pop up."
4016480,4017640," Because it makes me feel good."
4017640,4019440," Thank you."
4019440,4020640," All right."
4020640,4021940," That's actually super cool."
4021940,4023980," That's very, very pogue."
4023980,4025340," So I'm going to use Vim."
4025340,4028640," But I really hate this highlighting theme."
4028640,4030800," I think it's dumb."
4030800,4037780," And this is primarily influenced by the terminal that I'm using."
4037780,4041140," So what about if I use the GVim?"
4041140,4046260," GVim has this syntax, like theme, that is actually more pleasant and I really like it."
4046260,4048100," It's like a desert theme."
4048100,4050260," And I think it's pretty cool."
4050260,4052000," So what do you guys think?"
4052000,4057820," Unfortunately, I cannot zoom in and zoom out in this particular editor."
4057820,4060900," But I think this particular size of code is OK."
4060900,4063160," Vim Huge X."
4063160,4064800," Yes, it's one of those things."
4064800,4066500," It's a huge X."
4066500,4071320," I don't remember in which distro it's huge X or something."
4071320,4076180," I mean, it's like a really strange name, but anyway."
4076180,4077180," Cool."
4077180,4078180," Cool."
4078180,4079180," Cool."
4079180,4080180," Cool."
4080180,4084820," That's a lot of garbage."
4084820,4085820," Holy fuck."
4085820,4090520," Let me do a git init and let's take a look at the status."
4090520,4095960," So yeah, if I add everything, I can probably even do something like this."
4095960,4100080," Git ignore and I'm going to include the main."
4100080,4104840," Oh, by the way, when I do that, oh, it automatically detaches from the terminal."
4104840,4106840," GVim is so cool."
4106840,4115540," By the way, can I actually mention how GVim is so underrated in Linux community?"
4115540,4120040," So usually GVim is used on Windows, right?"
4120040,4125920," So when Beamers use Windows, they usually use GVim, but Linuxers don't really use GVim that often."
4125920,4130040," It's kind of strange, but it's so good because it detaches you from"
4130040,4130800," the terminal, right?"
4130800,4134800," So you don't have to deal with escape codes like of terminal or anything like that."
4134800,4136800," Everything works like super fast."
4136800,4139800," And yeah, it's just such a nice editor."
4139800,4140560," I don't know."
4140560,4141560," Like I really like it."
4141560,4142560," I like it better than Beam."
4142560,4144560," And maybe this is because I'm Emacs, right?"
4144560,4148560," Emacs is like used to like GUI editors."
4148560,4150560," Because I like having the same experience as console."
4150560,4151560," Okay."
4151560,4152560," Fair enough."
4152560,4153560," Sounds reasonable."
4153560,4155560," It's because it cannot go over SSH properly."
4155560,4156560," Oh, okay."
4156560,4158560," Another interesting thing."
4158560,4160320," Same hotkeys, etc."
4160320,4162320," Isn't the point of using the raw Beam is to be in terminal?"
4162320,4163320," Okay."
4163320,4164320," I see a point."
4164320,4165320," I see a point."
4165320,4170160," the reason why I don't understand those points is because I'm Emacs and Emacs are used to"
4170160,4171080," using GUI editors."
4171080,4177080," So for us, we kind of, you know, separated ourselves from these concerns, right?"
4177080,4180320," So, um, yeah, okay."
4180320,4181240," This explains everything."
4181240,4183840," I'm just, you know, I just have an Emacs brain."
4183840,4184840," Um,"
4184840,4189720," GVim doesn't work with X11 forwarding."
4189720,4191840," It should be actually working with it."
4191840,4192840," Hmm."
4192840,4196720," In Emacs, you have a terminal, an editor, not editor in the terminal."
4196720,4197920," Yeah, it's actually true."
4197920,4202720," So, uh, if you start Emacs, right, if you start Emacs, you can start the terminal and there"
4202720,4203720," you go."
4203720,4204720," Here's your terminal."
4204720,4205720," So you can, you can use it."
4205720,4208880," Inside of it and it even works about that."
4208880,4209880," Isn't that amazing?"
4209880,4210880," I think it's good."
4210880,4211880," Damn fucking amazing."
4211880,4212880," Maybe."
4212880,4217160," Ah, what I love about Vim is the Insta start item."
4217160,4227160," You mean something like this, uh, very much the same time."
4227160,4228960," Uh, all right."
4228960,4229960," Oh, fuck."
4229960,4232080," I use the wrong editor."
4232080,4235360," So what I want you to do here is I want you to explore the client."
4235360,4237520," I want you to explore the client thingy."
4237520,4238520," Here are some posts."
4238520,4242520," What is the, uh, weather service you use for your boat?"
4242520,4243520," What is the weather service?"
4243520,4246520," It's like WTTR or something."
4246520,4248520," I keep forgetting it actually."
4248520,4250520," Um, by the way, my, my, my kiddo is ready."
4250520,4255680," I'm going to quickly go to the kitchen and just pour some hot water and I'm going to get back."
4255680,4257680," WTTR and you put CD there."
4257680,4258680," Okay."
4258680,4261680," I'm going to use this thing for testing the AWS client."
4261680,4263840," So this is what we're going to use."
4263840,4264840," Okay."
4264840,4266840," I'm going to quickly pour the, uh, the hot water and come back."
4266840,4267640," Thank you."
4267640,4267840," Thank you."
4267840,4267840," Thank you."
4267840,4269000," Thank you so much for, for watching."
4269000,4284160," Uh, oh, format four."
4284160,4284160," Yeah."
4284160,4302500," It also has to be in a very specific format because it also output a bunch of bullshit that"
4302500,4303340," you may not want."
4303340,4304420," Uh, thank you."
4304420,4305140," Thank you so much."
4305140,4306500," Um, all right."
4306500,4313460," I think we also need to update, he came finally, uh, yes, we need to update the title."
4313460,4323700," Um, considering, considering writing, um, writing a boat in ADA."
4323700,4325220," Yes."
4325220,4326660," So this is what we're going to have here."
4329300,4336580," Twitch, how hard it is to just not hide this button down there."
4336580,4339380," Does anyone even care about this page anymore?"
4339380,4343780," Like how difficult it, like, it doesn't even have a scroll."
4343780,4344020," Okay."
4344020,4348980," It does have a scroll, but then if you scroll down to the, to the complete bottom, it's still"
4348980,4349780," not visible."
4349780,4357220," Like in this problem, like exists for such a long time."
4357220,4358340," Holy shit."
4358340,4360660," And it's almost like nobody gives a shit about this problem."
4360660,4362420," Uh, you know what?"
4362420,4366340," Because of this problem, I'm going to run a 30 seconds ad."
4366340,4366740," There we go."
4366740,4368100," That's what you get."
4368100,4373700," I need the compensation for, for my, for my struggles."
4373700,4374740," I'm just joking."
4374740,4375380," It was a joke."
4375380,4378180," Uh, all right."
4378180,4382740," Add blocker game game."
4384020,4387780," Maybe a better project for the LWS is writing this, uh, dashboard."
4387780,4391700," Uh, how would you revise that, that, that dashboard?"
4391700,4397700," You mean something like that will interact with which over at which API and stuff like that."
4397700,4398580," Uh, yeah."
4398580,4400580," Punish the viewers."
4400580,4400820," Yeah."
4400820,4401620," This is how we roll."
4402340,4403380," Um, okay."
4403380,4408660," So what I want to do is maybe create another file, uh, where we're going to have something like client."
4408660,4411220," Uh, WTTR, uh, ATB."
4411220,4413940," Fuck."
4413940,4416020," Uh, okay."
4416020,4417620," And also I can do something like this."
4417620,4422980," I can actually split things, uh, and then, uh, just have this on my other side."
4422980,4426740," So this is going to be with add a text."
4426740,4429780," I use add a."
4429780,4432740," By the way, how do you pronounce it correctly?"
4432740,4434340," Is it add or ada?"
4434340,4437060," Is it data or data?"
4437060,4443540," Uh, so how do you pronounce it?"
4443540,4450260," Um, is this the add app OMG that helps with the medical diagnosis?"
4450260,4452260," Yes, no, it's actually not."
4452260,4453700," All right."
4453700,4459780," So we're going to have a procedure and it's going to be WTTR and is a begin and end."
4459780,4460340," There we go."
4460340,4463460," Okay."
4463460,4466260," Let's see."
4466260,4467300," But why not other."
4467300,4469300," Why not other."
4469300,4470900," You pronounce it like."
4470900,4473780," Other, not other."
4473780,4474180," I see."
4474180,4474820," Thank you so much."
4474820,4476900," Um, all right."
4476900,4479540," So what we need to do here is I suppose we need to do."
4479540,4482020," AWS, uh, client."
4482020,4483700," So we are importing the clients."
4483700,4486740," So once you imported the client."
4486740,4495460," Something, something strange going on with my neighbors."
4495460,4497540," Uh."
4497540,4501380," Hello stream loves."
4501380,4502180," Welcome to the stream."
4504020,4509220," Um, excuse me."
4509220,4514980," Uh, so here's the AWS client and um."
4514980,4517940," Here."
4517940,4520660," We need to do get."
4520660,4522660," All right."
4522660,4528500," And the only thing we need to do here is essentially provide the URL, right?"
4528500,4535780," We need to provide the URL, uh, AWS client gets and URL is going to be HTTPS."
4535780,4538500," Uh, it's actually just a regular HTTP, right?"
4538500,4539540," Uh, not HTTPS."
4539540,4540580," It's the WTTR."
4540580,4543940," Uh, so let me find this thing."
4543940,4546180," All right."
4547220,4550500," So, and let's actually copy paste this entire link here."
4550500,4554980," So, because you can always customize it slightly, uh, uh, later, right?"
4554980,4559380," Uh, what the fuck is going on?"
4559380,4559620," Okay."
4559620,4562500," Ah, I see."
4562500,4566340," Cool."
4566340,4567860," So, and I think that should be it."
4567860,4569780," And I wonder what's going to happen, right?"
4569780,4571140," I wonder what's going to happen."
4571140,4573940," Oh, by the way, this is a completely separate file, right?"
4573940,4578900," Since it's a completely separate file, we'll have to create another GPR file for it."
4578900,4583540," So here we have a GPR file for just the prop for the server."
4583540,4588180," I would like to rename this thing to a server GPR, right?"
4588180,4593220," So now it is a server, uh, and I'm going to open the server GPR."
4594420,4600660," So here we have server, uh, server, cool."
4600660,4603140," And I'm going to create another one."
4603140,4606980," It's going to be the WTTR GPR, or maybe I'm going to actually do it here."
4606980,4612340," WTTR GPR, uh, with AWS, right?"
4612340,4623700," With AWS, uh, project, uh, WTTR is this thing, uh, for the source directories, we're going to use, uh,"
4623700,4624340," SRC."
4624340,4630020," It's actually a pretty straightforward build tool, uh, for languages, we're going to use"
4630020,4633220," AIDA, NIDA."
4633220,4639940," Uh, and, uh, for the main, we're going to use WTTR."
4639940,4640420," Okay."
4640420,4644020," So the reason why I want to have these separate files is because now if I want to build,"
4644820,4652260," uh, WTTR specifically, uh, the only thing I have to do is GPR build P, uh, WTTR."
4652260,4657220," And it's going to build specifically on WTTR, but not going to touch the server, which is kind of cool."
4658020,4663860," Uh, no candidate, uh, uh, interpretation match the actual missing argument for parameter connection"
4663860,4665380," in call to get."
4665380,4665940," Okay."
4665940,4670980," So apparently you also have to provide the connection, so we cannot just take the URL."
4670980,4672260," You have to do a connection."
4672260,4673700," Uh, right."
4673700,4675060," So let's actually take a look."
4675060,4676180," So what is the connection?"
4676980,4678740," Uh, and I didn't see the connection."
4678740,4680900," Huh?"
4680900,4685060," Like I literally don't see it."
4685060,4686260," It's just not there."
4686260,4699300," Retrieve the message data during specified URL with the server and ask for response."
4699300,4700580," Um, okay."
4700580,4706020," Missing parameter, uh, missing argument for parameter connection in call to get."
4707700,4713940," Maybe I'm looking at a very old, maybe I have a very old, uh, AWS and they can, uh,"
4713940,4715780," completely removed connection at some point."
4715780,4720260," Um, but yeah, let's, let's take a look connection."
4720260,4723780," Uh, HTTP connection."
4723780,4725940," So this is just separate types and stuff like that."
4725940,4731940," You can create a connection, but cat doesn't have a connection."
4731940,4733780," Is it some sort of a generic thing?"
4733780,4735060," It's not even generic."
4735780,4737220," So there's a connection error."
4737220,4741140," Um, yeah, it feels like a different version."
4741140,4742580," Okay."
4742580,4748660," So maybe we can find, um, we can find these things somewhere here."
4748660,4753220," I wonder where we can find the AWS and AWS files."
4753220,4757540," You know, the, uh, the ADS and ADB files."
4757540,4758660," That's what I meant."
4758660,4758900," Right."
4758900,4760580," So the signature and the body files."
4760580,4766420," So, because maybe we can just look into them and, um, learn about them."
4766420,4768660," To be fair."
4770180,4773620," How do you do, uh, this thing, uh, Outline?"
4773620,4774340," What's up, Outline?"
4774340,4780340," Uh, lib AWS 18 def."
4780340,4781780," Oh yeah."
4781780,4783300," This is how we do that."
4783300,4786580," So we actually do that in the share."
4786580,4787940," Yeah."
4787940,4792180," It's a user share and you look for ADA and ADA include."
4792180,4792580," Okay."
4792580,4793300," That makes sense."
4793300,4794340," This is actually pretty cool."
4794340,4797860," So we go into the user share ADA."
4797860,4803220," Uh, ADA and ADA include."
4803220,4805780," And the ADA include, we have AWS."
4805780,4810260," We have AWS and, uh, we probably have all of this stuff."
4810260,4813060," Uh, like we, uh, have a client."
4813940,4817060," And where is the client, uh, AWS client."
4817060,4817620," Here it is."
4817620,4819140," Nice."
4819140,4823060," So I can now try to open AWS, uh, client."
4823060,4826500," Hey, uh, ADS."
4826500,4829940," And, uh, function get."
4829940,4831140," Here's the function get."
4831140,4836100," So in our particular case, there is less, uh, parameters here."
4836100,4839540," There's URL, but I still don't see any connection."
4839540,4841140," And that's the problem."
4842500,4845780," Still no connection and I have no idea what they're talking about."
4845780,4848820," We can try to do something like connection and just look for it."
4848820,4851140," But overall, I just didn't see it."
4851140,4857940," Let me take a look at the, at the problem one more time."
4857940,4861220," But this, I know where, uh, where it can."
4861220,4862660," No missing argument for."
4862660,4866980," Declared at awks."
4866980,4868740," It is 433."
4868740,4870340," Huh."
4873060,4874020," 433."
4874020,4875940," Oh, shit."
4875940,4878180," Oh, shit."
4878180,4880500," It's overloaded."
4880500,4882820," Yes, it's Amazon Web Services."
4882820,4884580," Holy fuck."
4884580,4887060," So there is a function get."
4887060,4890100," And there is a procedure get."
4890100,4891540," Okay."
4893700,4895940," Can your C++ do that?"
4895940,4897780," Can your C++ do that?"
4897780,4903620," Because it's literally overloading based on the return type or the lack of one."
4903620,4906660," Isn't that fucking amazing?"
4906660,4913540," So basically, if you don't handle the return of a function, it's going to be resolved into procedure."
4913540,4917620," If you handle it somehow, it's going to be resolved into a function."
4918260,4919860," Can your C++ do that?"
4919860,4922500," I didn't think so."
4922500,4928180," Well, I mean, to be fair, like, a lot of languages are kind of losing to ADA."
4929540,4937780," The only thing the ADA is lacking in terms of, like, security and the richness of the type system is BorrowShaker."
4937780,4940820," But by itself, that is a very controversial feature anyway."
4941460,4942660," So, I don't know."
4942660,4946180," Big brain shit, but pretty unusable."
4946180,4948260," Cool."
4948260,4956020," All right."
4956020,4964900," So essentially, to force it to use the function version, we have to do something with the result of it."
4964900,4966980," That's very pogue."
4966980,4968660," That's very pogue."
4968660,4970980," And I got a drop of the tea on my glasses."
4970980,4975060," Just a second."
4975060,4979540," Just a very small one."
4979540,4984980," Yatanasov, hello, hello."
4984980,4986100," No TSMR."
4986100,4988980," No U."
4988980,4992740," Okay, so can I do something like this?"
4992740,4994980," This is not what I wanted."
4994980,4996980," I wanted something like this."
4996980,4998340," I can't do that."
4998340,5002740," So, I want to take a look at the function get."
5002740,5004580," Function get."
5004580,5005620," And what does it return?"
5005620,5007940," It returns response data."
5007940,5009700," So, let's do something like this."
5009700,5010260," Response."
5010260,5011540," Response."
5011540,5013940," It's going to be AWS."
5013940,5016180," AWS client."
5017940,5018900," Is it pretty client?"
5018900,5022180," Or maybe it's a response data."
5022180,5023780," Where does it take response data?"
5023780,5024420," Response."
5024420,5029140," It's located in here."
5029140,5033460," So, first thing we have to do, we have to do a with AWS response."
5033460,5034340," Here's the response."
5035540,5040420," And we'll have to do response data."
5040420,5044660," We're doing b-boomer stuff today."
5044660,5045940," Kind of, I guess."
5045940,5050260," Because AIDA is a very b-boomer language, not going to lie."
5050260,5051940," All right."
5051940,5054740," So, then we can do a response and we're going to assign this thing here."
5054740,5058420," I'm not even sure if you have to do this like a wall or a separator."
5058420,5059140," But we'll see."
5059140,5061460," The compiler will tell us anyway if we're doing something wrong."
5062820,5063140," All right."
5063140,5064420," So, let's try to build all that."
5064420,5066260," And it builds."
5066260,5067140," I was right."
5067140,5074580," It was overloading the procedure/function by its return type or the lack of return type."
5074580,5076660," So, that's actually pretty poked."
5076660,5077380," Not going to lie."
5077380,5078980," Okay."
5078980,5082340," So, if I try to run this thing, I suppose it will."
5082340,5083700," And this is not what I'm going to run."
5083700,5085460," I want to run WTTR."
5085460,5086580," Okay."
5086580,5088020," So, it performed something."
5088020,5090820," It probably made the request."
5090820,5094980," But we don't know the response because we don't print that response anywhere."
5094980,5096580," Oh, yeah."
5096580,5100820," So, the reason why we don't use AIDA mode is because it just doesn't work on Emacs."
5100820,5102020," We managed to install one."
5102020,5104980," But it has a pretty interesting highlighting."
5104980,5107380," WTTR ADB."
5107380,5110900," So, this is how it looks like."
5110900,5113540," This is the whole highlighting that we can get with the AIDA mode."
5113540,5115540," Isn't that pogue?"
5115540,5116500," I think it's pretty pogue."
5116500,5124820," Hello, here's car."
5124820,5125140," Welcome."
5125140,5128420," No callers."
5128420,5128820," Yeah."
5128820,5130580," So, that's why I'm using Vim."
5130580,5131700," Specifically, GVim."
5131700,5134900," Because I'm kind of gut-sick of the Vim theme in my terminal."
5134900,5138100," I really like the desert theme of Vim."
5138100,5139380," In GVim, specifically."
5139380,5140180," I think it's kind of cool."
5140180,5142180," All right."
5142180,5145380," So, can I have something like AWS response?"
5145380,5147460," Just take a look at the responses."
5147460,5150260," It's not for resources."
5150260,5151460," Responds."
5151460,5154980," ADS."
5154980,5155940," Yeah."
5155940,5156900," I need only S."
5159220,5161220," And I'm looking for data."
5161220,5162180," I'm looking for data."
5162180,5163460," Type data is private."
5163460,5164180," Okay."
5164180,5166180," So, that's actually pretty cool."
5166180,5166740," Right?"
5166740,5168500," It's completely opaque."
5168500,5169140," Right?"
5169140,5170420," So, we get the data."
5170420,5173140," But we cannot look inside of that type."
5173140,5174020," We don't know its size."
5174020,5175140," We don't know anything."
5175140,5175460," Okay."
5175460,5176420," Fair enough."
5176420,5182020," So, that means that there should be functions that can extract information out of data."
5182740,5185140," So, is there something that can get the content?"
5185140,5188260," Content length type."
5188260,5189700," Build."
5189700,5190980," I think it's called body."
5190980,5192420," I'm pretty sure it's called body."
5192420,5195380," Function build message body."
5195380,5197300," Post."
5197300,5201460," So, it's primarily like building things."
5201460,5204260," But I don't see how can I get a body."
5204260,5208020," And there's like no really way to get the body."
5208020,5208260," Okay."
5208260,5209060," Content length."
5209060,5211060," Content type."
5211060,5212260," Status code."
5212260,5212500," Okay."
5212500,5213220," So, here they are."
5213220,5217700," So, you provide the data."
5217700,5219460," And you can extract the status code."
5219460,5221780," And it will give you messages status code."
5221780,5222820," And what is messages."
5222820,5224820," And I suppose this is like yet another."
5224820,5227220," Yet another module."
5227220,5228180," So, it's going to be with."
5228180,5230820," Yeah."
5230820,5231220," There we go."
5231220,5232100," So, here's the messages."
5232100,5233860," We can actually split everything in here."
5233860,5235700," SP."
5235700,5239060," And I'm going to open messages ADS."
5240980,5243700," And specifically what we're looking here."
5243700,5246260," It's going to be status."
5246260,5249140," Status code."
5249140,5251220," So, this is the function I'm looking for."
5251220,5254740," It has to be function status code."
5254740,5255860," There we go."
5256820,5259380," And it returns the status code the type."
5259380,5261060," So, status code."
5261060,5263540," Hello, apparently potatoes."
5263540,5264660," Welcome to the stream."
5264660,5265700," Oh, that's pretty cool."
5265700,5267380," So, this is enumeration."
5267380,5268340," Look at that."
5268340,5271300," So, status code is just enumeration of different things."
5271300,5272580," So, it's not just a number."
5273860,5275540," Oh, this is such a cool idea."
5275540,5276420," Yeah."
5276420,5277060," By the way."
5277060,5282340," Why nobody makes status code and HTTP libraries and enumeration."
5282340,5284260," Instead of fucking integer."
5284260,5288340," Because there is like a limited amount of codes you can have here."
5288340,5289780," You do."
5289780,5290180," Okay."
5290180,5291300," I'm super happy."
5291300,5293220," That you do that."
5293220,5295460," You're doing the right thing."
5296900,5297700," But to be fair."
5297700,5300660," Will it make it difficult to extend it in the future?"
5300660,5302500," If more codes will be added?"
5302500,5305140," But yeah."
5305140,5309620," But a lot of libraries actually don't do that."
5309620,5311940," So, yeah."
5311940,5312980," That's pretty cool."
5312980,5316660," I wonder if I can then take an image of this thing and convert it to..."
5316660,5319540," Oh, shit."
5319540,5320820," This is so cool."
5320820,5323540," Look at that."
5323540,5325460," You can define enumeration."
5326180,5329780," And for then you can define subtypes of enumeration."
5329780,5333940," So, you see informational is a subtype of status code."
5333940,5336580," And it's a range of a status code."
5336580,5340980," And it's a new separate type that is subtype without any OOP bullshit."
5340980,5341620," By the way."
5341620,5346260," You can define enumeration type and then subtype of enumeration."
5346260,5347780," And this is not OOPs."
5347780,5348740," This is not inheritance."
5348740,5351780," It's just taking a set and taking a subset of a set."
5351780,5352980," And this is a new type."
5352980,5353940," The fuck."
5353940,5355220," Holy shit."
5355220,5356020," This is so cool."
5356020,5361220," The fuck."
5361220,5365540," Why is this so reasonable?"
5365540,5366740," I mean, the syntax is shit."
5366740,5372100," But the idea is like the things behind like semantical things are so fucking reasonable."
5372100,5373940," It's like, yeah."
5375940,5382100," Content and coding is all right, I'm super happy with this shit."
5382100,5382660," All right."
5382660,5385460," So, what we can do here is we take the response."
5385460,5391940," Let's actually capitalize that because it's ADA response."
5391940,5395380," And we want to take a status code."
5395380,5395780," Right."
5395780,5399780," Status code for the response."
5399780,5400420," There we go."
5400420,5400420," There we go."
5400420,5400420," There we go."
5400420,5406500," And we can always take an image of the status code."
5406500,5406660," Right."
5406660,5408420," So, we can also do something like image."
5410180,5410820," Oh yeah."
5410820,5418820," This one is actually kind of, yeah, because this comes from AWS response, response status code."
5418820,5426260," And this comes from AWS messages, so we have to do something like AWS messages."
5429700,5435300," And I really like how I don't even need to read documentation for this library."
5435300,5438020," I can just look at the signature files."
5438020,5440820," So, ADS stands for AD signatures files."
5440820,5444500," It's like headers or interface files in OCaml."
5444500,5447540," And everything is clear so far."
5447540,5447860," Right."
5447860,5450580," So, this is how I get the status code."
5450580,5453540," And I can try to print."
5453540,5455140," So, let's see what we're going to get."
5455140,5456820," So, I need to put a line."
5458980,5461620," response status code."
5461620,5464980," And I think this is how you concatenate things."
5464980,5467620," This is how you concatenate things."
5467620,5470420," And let me actually go somewhere here."
5470420,5473700," And let's try to recompile this into that thing and see if it's going to do things."
5473700,5479940," Compiles."
5479940,5481620," And if I try to run it."
5481620,5484420," Response status code 200."
5484420,5486180," It just worked."
5486180,5488500," So, it's like."
5489780,5492020," Who said that I'm going to have a huge pain in the ass?"
5492020,5495540," Like, I don't really have that much pain in the ass so far."
5495540,5497140," I'm not even reading documentation."
5497140,5498660," I'm just looking at the source code."
5498660,5499460," All the signature."
5499460,5501060," And everything just makes sense."
5501060,5504260," It's like, you know, pieces just fit together."
5504260,5506340," It's just a description of how pieces fit together."
5506340,5508340," And I don't even know ADA that much."
5508340,5512100," So, why do I like this language?"
5512100,5513380," Like, what the fuck is wrong with me?"
5513380,5515620," What the fuck is wrong with this language?"
5515620,5516020," I don't know."
5516020,5517700," Okay."
5517700,5519220," So, we can have a message body now."
5519220,5521220," We can try to extract the message body."
5521220,5522660," And it's actually super straightforward."
5522660,5525940," So, AWS."
5525940,5532420," AWS response message body."
5532420,5532900," There we go."
5532900,5534180," So, here's the message body."
5534180,5535620," And I just use the response."
5535620,5537860," And let's just print it."
5537860,5541780," Response body."
5541780,5548100," And nearly as good as PHP."
5548100,5549380," You're goddamn right."
5549380,5551620," You're goddamn right."
5551620,5552180," Okay."
5552180,5553700," So, let's try to rebuild this entire thing."
5553700,5554980," Alrighty."
5554980,5555380," Alrighty."
5555380,5555780," Alrighty."
5556980,5568900," So, let's continue."
5568900,5570580," Cool."
5570580,5574340," It worked."
5574340,5579300," We just made an HTTP request using ADA and it just works."
5579300,5580820," Isn't that amazing?"
5580820,5581620," Isn't that amazing?"
5581620,5583460," I think it's goddamn fucking amazing, mate."
5584660,5586260," Results."
5586260,5591300," Did I say the results?"
5591300,5593220," Probably."
5593220,5594980," Okay."
5594980,5603540," Does this support an HTTPS interface?"
5603540,5605700," Can I do this over HTTPS?"
5605700,5607140," Okay."
5607140,5608900," I can do that over HTTPS."
5608900,5609540," This is cool."
5609540,5611940," So, does"
5614260,5617700," AWS supports HTTPS?"
5617700,5620180," We're about to find out."
5620180,5626260," It supports HTTPS."
5626260,5630660," So, we can already interact with different APIs."
5630660,5633060," And do different interesting things."
5633060,5637060," We can already interact with GitHub API."
5637060,5638980," With Twitch API."
5641380,5642580," And, yeah."
5642580,5644820," Probably with Discord API as well."
5644820,5647460," So, SSL 3.0."
5647460,5650180," Imagine not supporting HTTPS."
5650180,5652020," We're talking about a boomer language."
5652020,5660100," So, I wouldn't be surprised if to have like HTTPS support, you'll have to do some weird stuff."
5660100,5662100," So, yeah."
5663700,5664340," Okay."
5664340,5666260," So, we can interact with things."
5666260,5672020," Now, can we have IRC support?"
5672020,5673060," Right."
5673060,5679140," So, we already know that there is a library called ADAIRC."
5679140,5680420," Here it is."
5680420,5681380," But the question is..."
5681380,5681780," Oh, my God."
5681780,5682420," Look at that."
5682420,5684740," Oh, my God."
5684740,5688820," I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel."
5688820,5691620," Nobody uses this shit."
5691620,5692340," Who's Eric?"
5692340,5693060," This is the hero."
5693060,5694420," This is like a real hero."
5694420,5700420," Who's like, I mean, put out the only ADAIRC library out there."
5701300,5707940," And it's kind of abandoned, but I mean, don't blame him because, you know, it's just..."
5707940,5709860," Nobody uses this language."
5709860,5711940," It's a nine years old library."
5711940,5712180," Yeah."
5712180,5715860," I wonder if it's available on Debian."
5715860,5716980," So, ADAIRC."
5716980,5721700," He's using Python nowadays, but Python is not secure enough."
5721700,5723220," What the fuck is he doing?"
5723220,5723780," Stop."
5724500,5725380," Stop."
5725380,5726660," Stop using Python."
5726660,5727620," It's not secure."
5727620,5729220," All right."
5729220,5731460," So, let's actually try to build this thing."
5731460,5735780," So, to build, you can build all to create a release build."
5735780,5740180," Build debug to make the tests in examples."
5740180,5741780," So, there's a bunch of examples."
5741780,5745300," It's kind of interesting."
5745300,5747060," So, these examples don't have a G..."
5747060,5748660," He has..."
5748660,5749940," Oh, he doesn't have binaries."
5749940,5750420," Okay."
5750420,5751140," That makes sense."
5752340,5753700," Here's a GPR."
5753700,5757300," So, build."
5757300,5759140," So, there are different build types."
5759140,5761540," And source_dir is that."
5761540,5764020," Object_dir is..."
5764020,5764260," Oh!"
5764260,5765620," Okay."
5765620,5769940," So, you can actually specify object_dir and it's going to put all the garbage there."
5769940,5771300," Oh, shit."
5771300,5771860," I need that."
5771860,5773860," Wait a second."
5773860,5777140," I'm going to quickly just add that to my files as well."
5777140,5777700," GPR."
5779700,5780740," For object."
5780740,5782500," What was that?"
5782500,5784100," Object_dir."
5784100,5785860," Use."
5785860,5787860," Build."
5787860,5792020," So, and if I try to do GPR build..."
5792020,5793460," Is it going to..."
5793460,5795860," Discriminant."
5795860,5797300," Discriminant check failed."
5797300,5798980," Raced constraint error."
5798980,5800580," What the hell are you talking about, bro?"
5800580,5802100," Ah!"
5802100,5804980," Because I specified array, I suppose."
5804980,5806500," I think it looks like an array."
5806500,5808420," But expected a single value."
5808420,5808980," So, there's..."
5808980,5809220," Yeah."
5809220,5809460," Okay."
5809460,5810100," That makes sense."
5810100,5814260," Object_dir is a build not found."
5814260,5814660," Oh!"
5814660,5816420," It has to exist!"
5816420,5823060," Why can't you just create it then?"
5823060,5824900," Well, I mean, maybe it does make sense."
5824900,5826420," All right."
5826420,5827620," So, if I go to the build..."
5827620,5829940," It put all the garbage there!"
5829940,5830900," Oh my god!"
5830900,5831860," I want to hug you."
5831860,5833460," Anyway."
5833460,5836980," So, cool."
5836980,5839620," So, this is how you can get rid of all that."
5839620,5840580," That's super cool."
5840580,5842900," Creating is not secure."
5842900,5844100," Well, technically, yes."
5844100,5844820," Technically, yes."
5844820,5849780," And yeah, I'm telling you, Eric is a real hero."
5849780,5850180," Okay."
5850180,5854740," So, he not only put out the library for a very obscure language."
5854740,5858180," He also educating us, right?"
5858180,5861140," So, we're actually learning from his project."
5861140,5862100," Isn't that amazing?"
5862100,5865860," Why am I so excited about this language?"
5865860,5867220," It's not even that special."
5867220,5869780," But there's something..."
5869780,5871380," There's something about this language."
5871380,5871780," Like, it's just..."
5871780,5873620," I don't know."
5873620,5875700," Maybe I'm just..."
5875700,5877860," Maybe this is because I'm a boomer."
5877860,5879060," Yeah, that's probably why."
5879060,5881140," So, boomer found the boomer language and..."
5881140,5883220," Yeah, it's just..."
5883220,5884820," That's what's going on here."
5884820,5885140," Anyway."
5885140,5887780," Let me see."
5887780,5890260," So, can we now try to build this entire thing?"
5890260,5894660," So, I'm going to clone that."
5894660,5900420," And this is going to be the real testimony of this programming language."
5900420,5901620," Seriously."
5901620,5904580," Remember the Elm example?"
5905780,5909460," Remember the Elm example that does not compile up to two years."
5909460,5911620," So, we have a two years program in Elm."
5911620,5913060," And you can just throw it away."
5913060,5915940," You can just throw it away, essentially."
5915940,5919060," So, we have a nine-year-old library in other."
5919060,5923700," Does it still compile in 2021?"
5923700,5925620," We're about to find out."
5925620,5926980," All right."
5926980,5928980," So, what do they say in the instructions?"
5928980,5930180," So, you just have to build all."
5930180,5930420," Okay."
5930420,5931460," Build all."
5931460,5934660," Impress me."
5934660,5936660," Fucking impress me."
5936660,5937780," Okay."
5937780,5938420," I'm impressed."
5938420,5939700," It builds."
5939700,5941300," What the fuck?"
5941300,5944420," And it builds so fucking fast."
5944420,5944740," Okay."
5944740,5946660," So, is it even real?"
5946660,5948100," Is it even working?"
5948100,5950180," Is it like maybe it's not finished or something?"
5950180,5952820," What the fuck?"
5952820,5958100," So, pure IRC."
5958100,5959700," Maybe there's nothing there."
5959700,5960180," Who knows?"
5960180,5962500," There's also IRC bot."
5962500,5965860," What the fuck?"
5968260,5968900," Okay."
5968900,5972100," So, you can also do like make tests to build some tests."
5972100,5974660," Okay."
5974660,5976420," It builds a bunch of bots."
5976420,5978100," And where does it put them?"
5978100,5980180," I suppose it puts them into the build folder."
5980180,5981300," And here they are."
5981300,5982820," But where are the executables?"
5982820,5985380," Okay."
5985380,5988100," So, there's a bunch of like O files in here."
5988100,5990340," And I'm not really sure how to use all of that."
5990340,5991620," But okay."
5991620,5992660," So, there's also lib."
5992660,5995060," So, here they are."
5995060,5997220," IRC, blah, blah, blah."
5999140,6000260," Uh-huh, uh-huh."
6000260,6001620," And examples."
6001620,6002820," If we take a look at the examples."
6002820,6004340," We have bin files."
6004340,6008180," And here are the executables for the bots."
6008180,6009940," And all of that fucking compiles."
6009940,6013620," Nine-year-old source code."
6013620,6015460," Holy shit."
6015460,6019220," I'm impressed."
6019220,6020580," I'm impressed."
6020580,6023540," Okay."
6023540,6025540," So, can we do pongbot?"
6027140,6027700," Uh-huh."
6027700,6028100," Okay."
6028100,6029700," Host name not found."
6029700,6032820," IRC 10-bit dot net."
6032820,6040980," Can we hack one of these things to actually, you know, uh, connect to Twitch or something?"
6040980,6043380," Can you, Rust, do that?"
6043380,6046420," Well, I've heard how Rust is stable these days."
6046420,6046740," Maybe."
6047620,6048580," Um, okay."
6048580,6050980," Vim Pogbot."
6050980,6053060," Let's take a look at Pogbot."
6053060,6058180," Uh, so, it does on message ping."
6058180,6062100," Uh, normally you, oh, they even have comments."
6062100,6067620," This bot simply connects to an IRC server and sticks around without doing much of anything."
6067620,6069300," Most simplistic example."
6070020,6070980," Um, okay."
6070980,6073700," So, you create a bot."
6073700,6075060," They even, oh my god."
6075060,6078900," He even provided, like, a special function to create a bot."
6078900,6081300," Not a client, but bot."
6081300,6083460," Um, all right."
6083460,6089380," Normally, you would use IRC command install to add the standard command set, blah, blah, blah."
6089380,6091220," The socket to identify the bot."
6091220,6092020," Uh, okay."
6092020,6095940," Loop until program is killed or an error occurs."
6095940,6097780," And you have, like, exceptions and stuff."
6097780,6100260," Okay, parse error, blah, blah, blah."
6100260,6101460," Close the socket."
6101460,6102340," Pretty step forward."
6102340,6103620," I cannot complain."
6103620,6103860," Okay."
6103860,6106500," So, uh, unbounded strings."
6106500,6107140," Makes sense."
6107140,6108020," IRC message."
6108020,6109220," You read the line."
6109220,6110580," Okay, bot reads the line."
6110580,6112580," Then you parse the IRC message."
6112580,6115060," And then you, uh, process this message, I suppose."
6115060,6118100," Print out the message so we can get some feedback."
6118980,6120260," Um, all right."
6120260,6122180," Uh, that's pretty poor."
6122180,6125540," Uh, maybe we can connect to free node or something."
6125540,6126740," That would be actually interesting."
6126740,6130820," Now, I'm going to create a language like Rust and call it stainless."
6130820,6131780," Like, very funny."
6131780,6133460," Now, we have a small question."
6133460,6137060," How hard would a hole punching be with TCP?"
6137060,6138580," Very hard."
6138580,6142260," Uh, okay."
6142260,6144100," So, let's go."
6144100,6145300," I'm going to go to the boat."
6145300,6148580," And just create another one."
6148580,6150020," That connects to something else."
6150020,6153940," Connect to free node."
6153940,6156980," He said very funny."
6156980,6157700," Pogue."
6157700,6158020," Yes."
6158020,6161780," Mr. Streamer acknowledged your funny joke."
6161780,6162420," Ha ha."
6162420,6163620," Ha ha."
6163620,6164580," All right."
6164580,6166980," So, uh, what are we going to connect to?"
6166980,6168100," What are we going to connect to?"
6168100,6171940," Chat free node dot net."
6172500,6180420," Um, port for plain text, uh, six, six, six, nine, seven for TLS encrypted connection."
6180420,6180580," Okay."
6180580,6183460," So, let's actually try a TLS encrypted connection."
6183460,6185540," It's going to be six, six, 97."
6185540,6187700," Nick pong bot."
6187700,6189060," Here's the pong bot."
6190020,6191060," Uh, cool."
6191060,6194340," Uh, let's try to rebuild this entire stuff."
6194340,6197140," We're going to rebuild all, uh, just in case."
6197140,6198420," And I'm going to rebuild the test."
6198420,6201540," Uh, uh, uh, it's rebuilding pong bot."
6201540,6203620," We're going to go to the example bin."
6203620,6207780," Not view, uh, uh, pong bot."
6209060,6210980," Uh, connection reset by peer."
6210980,6211380," Okay."
6211380,6215140," So it feels like it couldn't do the, uh, TLS connection."
6215140,6219140," That's what it feels like."
6219140,6225860," But if we try a plain text one, um,"
6225860,6230740," okay, uh, six, six."
6230740,6232420," What about plain text one?"
6232420,6233060," Six, six."
6233060,6235060," So this one is going to be just six."
6236980,6238420," Uh, can I have make here?"
6238420,6240180," I don't think I have makes in here."
6240180,6240500," Yeah."
6240500,6242820," Make has to be like from here."
6242820,6244180," There we go."
6244180,6247700," Example."
6247700,6250820," Uh, an option on the library."
6250820,6251460," Yeah, probably."
6251460,6253860," Uh, we'll figure it out at some point."
6253860,6254420," Pong bot."
6254420,6255380," Okay."
6255380,6255860," It works."
6255860,6258420," Uh, so on the, on the,"
6258420,6262100," on the plain text, it does work."
6262100,6264420," Uh, which is reasonable."
6264420,6265460," So this is, um,"
6266980,6268820," Uh, whatever."
6268820,6270260," I'm not going to even comment anything."
6270260,6271300," We can do something like this."
6271300,6278660," Original, uh, TLS, uh, plain text."
6278660,6281700," Uh, so let's go back."
6281700,6285460," So TLS, um, 32."
6285460,6288340," Pong bot."
6288340,6290020," Make test."
6293860,6297380," And it resets."
6297380,6298180," Okay."
6298180,6301940," So what kind of option could it be in the bot?"
6301940,6304820," We can take a look at the bot create."
6304820,6306500," So let's go where."
6306500,6309460," So it's, uh, ADA examples."
6309460,6310980," It could be SRC forth."
6310980,6314500," Uh, you wrote plan."
6314500,6315220," Oh, God damn."
6315220,6315780," Thank you so much."
6315780,6318820," And the compiler wouldn't even tell me that because it's a comment."
6319460,6320420," Thank you so much for it."
6320420,6323540," We actually caught a problem that couldn't be caught by a compiler."
6323540,6324420," Thank you."
6324420,6324660," Thank you."
6324660,6325220," Thank you."
6325220,6325620," By the way."
6325620,6325940," Hello."
6325940,6327300," Welcome to our stream."
6327300,6329300," How do you like ADA so far?"
6329300,6330500," Isn't that a cool language?"
6330500,6332980," Look how pascalish it is."
6332980,6334180," Look how boomer it is."
6334180,6337460," And me being boomer myself."
6337460,6338900," I actually like just enjoy it."
6338900,6341620," Does the TLS require certificate?"
6341620,6342260," Certificate?"
6342260,6342820," Probably."
6342820,6344340," We're about to find out."
6344340,6345540," We're about to find out."
6346660,6348100," Uh, all right."
6348100,6349060," Okay."
6349060,6350180," So what do we have?"
6350180,6352100," I need to, uh, separate this shit."
6352100,6355220," Uh, compiler not worrying about spelling issues in comments."
6355220,6355460," Yeah."
6355460,6361380," Oh, by the way, I think IntelliJ IDEA has a pretty cool feature where it"
6361380,6367860," checks the spelling in the names of classes and functions and variables."
6367860,6372260," So essentially, uh, it parses your name."
6372260,6376580," It recognizes whether it's a camel case or snake case, splits it by words,"
6376580,6379460," and then checks the spelling within those words."
6379460,6380340," Isn't that amazing?"
6380340,6382500," I think it's actually pretty cool."
6382500,6383940," This is such a cool idea, in my opinion."
6383940,6385620," Um, yeah."
6385620,6392340," Um, so anyway, uh, let's actually go to the library and, uh, let's take a look at the"
6392340,6401540," parameters that you have in our IRC bot create, uh, IRC bot, uh, s, uh, create."
6401540,6402820," I think it's a, it's a function."
6402820,6403860," I think it's a procedure."
6403860,6406580," Procedure create."
6406580,6408500," We don't have a procedure."
6408500,6408820," Great."
6408820,6409380," What do we have?"
6409380,6410020," Just create."
6410020,6412660," Oh, it's a function because it's returns a connection."
6412660,6412980," Okay."
6412980,6420580," So, so far, uh, yeah, it accepts only a server."
6421300,6427620," Uh, socket port, um, and a nick, and it doesn't accept anything else."
6427620,6432420," Unfortunately, it doesn't accept anything else unless."
6432420,6435060," Yeah."
6435060,6443460," So the thing here is that IRC bot library is probably built on top of, uh, a proper IRC"
6443460,6448900," library, and maybe it has to be done, uh, in the more low level, right?"
6448900,6450900," Because you can create connection, right?"
6450900,6452580," You can create some sort of a connection."
6452580,6456740," Uh, all right."
6456740,6458580," So yeah, here's the connection."
6458580,6461380," And then you use this connection to do things."
6465220,6470340," So, uh, is there any other way to create a connection return connection?"
6470340,6470660," Okay."
6470660,6472660," This is the only function that returns a connection."
6472660,6474260," Okay."
6474260,6480980," So, so far we don't have any opportunity to use TLS unless we create connection that uses TLS."
6480980,6483540," Write your own IRC library."
6483540,6488900," And I would rather extend this library because this library looks nice."
6489700,6491060," I actually like it so far."
6491060,6494500," Um, so I would try to find ways to extend it."
6494500,6498740," I wonder how, how, uh, active Eric is on the internet these days."
6498740,6501380," Maybe does he develop anything?"
6501380,6504340," Oh yeah, he's pretty reactive."
6504340,6507380," So maybe he will react to our pull request if we ever submit one."
6507380,6510740," Um, so, and there's no like issues."
6510740,6511700," There's no pull request."
6511700,6513620," Like literally nobody's using it."
6513620,6517060," Uh, was there another board example?"
6517060,6518660," Maybe we'll, we'll take a look at it."
6518660,6521780," It was like a host bot, but I don't think it's using TLS either."
6521780,6523780," Uh, okay."
6523780,6527540," Nobody ever submitted a single issue to this project."
6527540,6532020," Nobody ever submitted a single pull request to this issue, to this project."
6532020,6533140," Okay."
6533140,6534580," We're about to be the first one."
6534580,6537460," It's not really a dead project."
6537460,6538580," It's rather dead language."
6539380,6543140," So it's like, it's language that is used only by US militaries."
6543140,6544900," And US militaries don't use IRC."
6544900,6545940," I'm pretty sure they don't."
6545940,6550420," Um, time to submit the first issue."
6550420,6551860," Rewrite it in Rust."
6551860,6552100," Yeah."
6552100,6555140," Rewrite it in Rust."
6555140,6556900," Rewrite it in Rust."
6556900,6558660," Rewrite it in Rust."
6558660,6560340," Too many syllables, but it kind of works."
6560340,6563700," Rewrite it in Rust."
6563700,6564020," All right."
6564020,6566820," Uh, what I was thinking about?"
6569620,6570260," Yeah."
6570260,6570500," Okay."
6570500,6571940," So let's actually close all this shit."
6571940,6576100," And, uh, let's take a look at other examples here."
6576100,6581300," So there was a host bot, uh, and I don't think host bot is anything special."
6581300,6582260," Right."
6582260,6584980," All of them are probably using like create bot."
6584980,6585620," That's yeah."
6585620,6589380," It's just, uh, it does use 6667."
6589380,6593460," So, okay."
6593460,6596180," So let's go to the SRC."
6596180,6601940," Um, and here is IRC library itself."
6601940,6603780," Here's IRC library itself."
6603780,6608260," Uh, so there's the messages, commands."
6608260,6612500," Uh, maybe I'm going to take a look at the IRC bot ADB."
6613060,6614900," And how do you create this thing?"
6614900,6618020," All right."
6618020,6622500," So, uh, we use Gnat sockets."
6622500,6626500," We use Gnat sockets to connect to things."
6626500,6626900," All right."
6626900,6629780," Uh, and then we have a C connection."
6629780,6632980," And I suppose C connection is just like it's custom type."
6632980,6634980," Uh huh."
6634980,6638100," So it just creates the connection type, nothing special."
6638100,6645860," Uh, and when we, uh, connect, when we connect, if it's connected, uh, you create a socket,"
6645860,6650500," connect the socket and you mark the connection being connected."
6650500,6654660," And, uh, how do we, we don't even return because connection is in out."
6654660,6655700," All right."
6655700,6658100," Looks good so far."
6661220,6668900," So it's all boils down to maybe passing some special parameters to Gnat, uh, sockets."
6668900,6673940," So we need to understand how Gnat sockets work and whether you can do TLS with them."
6673940,6674740," You see what I mean?"
6674740,6676820," Uh, you see what I mean?"
6676820,6680980," And if we manage to do that, maybe it's going to be a lucky winner or something."
6680980,6681380," I don't know."
6681380,6685860," Um, it looks good to me so far."
6685860,6690500," Um, I want to take a look at the POG bot one more time."
6691220,6696020," Um, wait a second."
6696020,6699780," Wait a fucking second."
6699780,6704820," Wait a fucking second."
6704820,6707300," Um, where am I?"
6707300,6709300," So I'm on examples."
6709300,6711780," Then SRC, I need SRC though."
6711780,6713460," Ah, okay."
6714420,6717460," SOC, IRC, bot ADB."
6717460,6728340," Connect is a function with a single argument, but I call it as a method of bot."
6731620,6733220," Is that a new reference?"
6733220,6741380," Is that like a universal function call syntax thingy?"
6741380,6742340," Whatever the fuck it is."
6752900,6754580," I think it's not going to generally work."
6754580,6756900," Um, right."
6756900,6762740," So I think it's not going to generally work because you need to have something like tagged type or whatever."
6762740,6766420," Um, so if we go to the examples, IRC bot."
6766420,6769700," Um, it's not examples."
6769700,6773300," It's SRC, IRC bot ADS."
6773300,6775140," And we take a look at the connection type."
6776420,6778500," Yeah, it's tagged private."
6778500,6781060," I think it's only, it only works on attacked types."
6781060,6784100," ADA, tagged types."
6784100,6785860," What's so special about tagged types?"
6785860,6789220," Type extension R, ADA, uh, amendment."
6789220,6793460," Attack types provide support for dynamic polymorphism and type extension."
6793460,6798740," Attack type bears a hidden tag that identifies the type at runtime."
6798740,6802180," Apart from the tag, attack, uh, record is like any record."
6802180,6804340," So it can contain arbitrary data."
6804340,6807060," So it's, it's basically needed for the, for the polymorphism."
6807060,6807380," I see."
6807380,6811060," Gnat reference manual doesn't even mention TLS nor SSL."
6811060,6812020," Nice."
6812020,6813380," Epic."
6813380,6815060," I'm so fucking happy, happy."
6815060,6818260," You're already looking into that out there, right?"
6818260,6820740," So it's going to be fun."
6820740,6827140," ADA, Gnat, TLS, SSL."
6828740,6832260," Building AWS."
6832260,6840980," Well, I mean, to be fair, AWS can do TLS or SSL or whatever the fuck it is."
6840980,6841300," Okay."
6841300,6842980," So I know the one thing replaced another."
6842980,6844020," It doesn't fucking matter."
6844020,6844980," You know what I'm talking about."
6844980,6852420," So maybe we can steal some of this stuff from AWS, right?"
6852420,6854740," So maybe we can steal some stuff from there."
6855700,6863460," So if you look into AWS, I think in the source code, does it have a mentioning of TLS?"
6863460,6865380," So it has a core."
6865380,6871700," So, um, so that's SSL."
6871700,6872660," Okay."
6872660,6875460," So there's, uh, SSL, IDS, AWS net."
6876420,6879380," So it does know how to do something."
6879380,6885620," So it's SSL thin, SSL thin, huh?"
6885620,6890820," So, and maybe it uses like third party dependencies and whatnot."
6890820,6895220," Zero X C three three zero one is gifting five tier subs."
6895220,6900660," Thank you so much for, uh, supporting the, the channel and, uh, see for this."
6900660,6905300," Zess, uh, Jinsk, W, Jul X, Y, Z, Smertos and Wobi."
6905300,6908900," Welcome to our epic Ada club."
6908900,6910580," How about that bitch?"
6910580,6911700," Oh, wait a second."
6911700,6915140," The SSL, I see SSL, SSL detected."
6915140,6915940," Yes."
6915940,6917460," Epic."
6918340,6919300," Let's look into that."
6919300,6922580," So AWS can do SSL."
6922580,6925220," Um, and what this thing does?"
6925220,6926980," Cryptolib."
6926980,6928420," Huh?"
6928420,6931940," SSL detected."
6931940,6934180," Uh, binding."
6934180,6938100," I see."
6938100,6945460," So essentially they wrote like a thin wrapper around open SSL and they're just using open SSL."
6945460,6946180," Okay, I see."
6946180,6950340," Well, I mean, uh, it's a reasonable solution."
6950340,6954260," I guess, I guess it's a reasonable solution."
6954260,6961780," Uh, there's only one children."
6961780,6969060," One children."
6973460,6975140," The main developer is Russian."
6975140,6980020," Language for ES military."
6980020,6984020," Interesting."
6984020,6989780," Okay."
6989780,6992580," One children."
6992580,6997220," I mean, come on."
6997220,7001620," It's probably was written by this dude and he doesn't really speak English that well."
7001620,7003540," I can see myself making the same mistake."
7003540,7004020," Like, you know,"
7004020,7007220," plural and singular of children."
7007220,7010820," Child is hard for people who speak English as a second language."
7010820,7011460," Okay."
7011460,7012820," It's because it doesn't follow the rules."
7012820,7014180," Well, why do you have children?"
7014180,7016260," Why don't you call it childs?"
7016260,7019460," What's wrong with you English-speaking people?"
7019460,7020660," It's childs."
7025540,7027540," All right, so let's take a look at this thing."
7027540,7033140," So there's also SSL GPR."
7033140,7038580," So does when open SSL static."
7038580,7042260," Ah, and it also goes into the build."
7042260,7043540," AWS config."
7043540,7045380," Okay."
7045380,7046420," This one is complicated."
7046420,7047300," What about this one?"
7047300,7049620," Is it as complicated as anything else?"
7049620,7052260," Also, it uses some shared stuff."
7052260,7060740," This is really strange."
7060740,7062820," And how do you use it afterwards?"
7062820,7063620," It's because the..."
7063620,7074420," Ah, and SSL wrappers is an independent package to stop all the SSL thin routines."
7076900,7078020," So, SSL..."
7078020,7081060," What was that?"
7081060,7084180," I need it."
7084180,7088260," SSL wrappers."
7088260,7092580," And where can we find SSL wrappers?"
7092580,7095300," You know what?"
7095300,7100820," I'm going to actually clone this entire thing because it's going to be easier for us to work with it."
7100820,7105620," AWS."
7106900,7113780," That's actually a pretty small project."
7113780,7116260," It doesn't really have that much of the data."
7116260,7117140," We've already cloned it."
7117140,7121700," So, what if I grab..."
7121700,7125700," SSL wrappers?"
7125700,7127620," SSL poggers?"
7127620,7130500," And we don't really have that."
7130500,7131380," That's really strange."
7136580,7138740," Okay, let's find everything related to SSL."
7138740,7139780," And that's a lot, actually."
7139780,7142580," That's actually a lot."
7142580,7149460," So, there is some documentation."
7149460,7150580," Building AWS."
7150580,7152420," Using AWS."
7152420,7154900," I don't really care about RST."
7154900,7156980," So, all of that is documentation, right?"
7156980,7158260," So, oh, holy shit."
7158820,7162100," Can I exclude particular folders out of the grep?"
7162100,7164900," Can I exclude them?"
7164900,7166900," Exclude."
7166900,7168500," Exclude."
7168500,7172820," Skip any command line file with the name suffix."
7172820,7173300," Okay."
7173300,7177620," Wait, wait."
7177620,7179140," There was actually several excludes."
7180100,7182420," Exclude from an exclude deer."
7182420,7186340," Skip any command line director with the name prefix that matches globe."
7186340,7187780," Okay."
7187780,7189380," So, maybe we can do that."
7189380,7190260," Exclude deer."
7190260,7193780," And what's the directory that we need to exclude is docs."
7193780,7194180," Okay."
7194180,7194740," Ecorep."
7198660,7200420," So, let's actually exclude that."
7200420,7203140," Exclude docs."
7203140,7205140," And let's see."
7205140,7205620," And okay."
7205620,7207460," So, that was actually pretty effective."
7207460,7210900," So, and it didn't do anything."
7210900,7216580," Nice one."
7217540,7218980," Do I have to do that like here?"
7218980,7220100," I already see a CSL."
7220100,7223140," Um, okay."
7223140,7224500," So, let's exclude deer."
7224500,7224900," I'm in it."
7224900,7225700," Yes, I'm an idiot."
7225700,7226100," I'm sorry."
7226100,7226500," I'm sorry."
7226500,7227460," I'm such an idiot."
7227460,7228420," I'm really, really sorry."
7228420,7230020," Oh, what's up in the booth?"
7230020,7231380," Hello."
7231380,7233300," Yes, it works."
7233300,7235140," Naisu, Naisu, Naisu, Naisu."
7235140,7236820," Um, so."
7236820,7238660," Cool."
7238660,7241540," Something is actually broken here."
7241540,7243700," Ah, because it doesn't have."
7243700,7245460," Uh, yeah."
7245460,7247220," Yeah, there we go."
7247540,7253460," Uh, AWS Client, uh, SSE, AWS Net SSL."
7253460,7254900," Uh-huh."
7254900,7258100," AWS Net SSL."
7258100,7259700," Huh."
7259700,7264020," So, maybe we can use some of these things here."
7264020,7267060," Maybe we can use some of the things here."
7267060,7270820," Uh, AWS Net SSL."
7270820,7273380," Uh-huh."
7273380,7275220," Client."
7275220,7276260," It's just a client."
7277780,7279140," Set SSL config."
7279140,7280900," Yeah, I think that's what we need."
7280900,7283460," AWS Net SSL."
7284820,7285380," All right."
7285380,7285700," All right."
7285700,7286660," So, if I look."
7286660,7288900," Uh, if I go into one of these things."
7288900,7289540," So, this is a client."
7289540,7298660," So, that's the module we probably need."
7298660,7301780," Um, so, what it's all about."
7301780,7302740," What it's all about."
7302740,7304180," This is a library's free software."
7304180,7307940," Uh, this is the SSL based implementation of the Net package."
7307940,7313220," The implementation should depend on the AWS Net STD and the SSL library."
7313220,7317700," It is important to not call directly the socket bindings here to ease porting."
7317700,7319380," Uh, all right."
7320820,7322100," So, what you can do here."
7322100,7326500," Um, well, there you go."
7326500,7328020," You can connect to a socket."
7328020,7329540," So, we have a socket type."
7329540,7331780," And a socket type is a private thing."
7331780,7333700," So, we don't even know what is a socket type."
7334420,7336820," Uh, connect the socket on a given host port."
7336820,7338100," If wait is true, connect will."
7338100,7340260," Uh, uh, if wait is false."
7340260,7342180," The connection is established."
7342180,7343940," And it does not make the SSL hensher."
7343940,7347780," It is possible to wait for the connection completion by calling wait routine"
7347780,7350820," with output set to true and in event parameter."
7350820,7351620," There we go."
7351620,7357940," So, um, you can have SSL, um, or TLS, whatever the fuck you want to call it."
7357940,7361860," Sockets, uh, by utilizing AWS."
7361860,7362980," Right."
7362980,7368820," But that will make AWS, uh, AWS."
7368820,7375220," That will make, uh, um, ADIRC depend on the AWS, which is not particularly great idea."
7375220,7378340," Which is not particularly great idea."
7378340,7381140," So, um, I kind of want to try that."
7381140,7383540," So, there's a different method."
7383540,7386660," So, as you can see, SSL, TLS, different versions of TLS."
7386660,7389860," Which one, which TLS is the latest one, by the way?"
7389860,7391540," TLS 1.3, I think."
7392260,7392660," Um."
7392660,7399620," What is the latest one?"
7399620,7402180," Hmm."
7402180,7404260," Yeah."
7404260,7405460," I think this one."
7406740,7409860," So, and it only supports TLS up to 1.2."
7409860,7415060," So, I wonder when they're gonna add support for that."
7415060,7415620," Wait!"
7415620,7418100," I'm looking at the old version, actually."
7418100,7419060," If you think about it."
7419060,7421620," I, I, this is the version that is on my machine."
7421620,7423780," The one on the GitHub."
7423780,7429220," The one on the GitHub probably, um, probably doesn't have any of these problems."
7429220,7430020," TLS, right."
7430020,7433060," Uh, where can I find?"
7433060,7434420," I need to find the file."
7434420,7437140," Uh, excuse me."
7437140,7438260," I don't, I go to file."
7438260,7438740," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
7438740,7445460," I, AWS net, uh, SSL, ADS."
7445460,7449460," So, and that thing was a method, right?"
7449460,7451380," So, that thing was a method."
7451380,7452500," Holy shit, it's so slow."
7452500,7454260," Type method."
7454260,7457060," And it still doesn't put 1.3."
7457060,7457380," Nice."
7457940,7461060," But at least, at least, look, look, look, look, look."
7461060,7465780," At least they removed support for SSL version 3."
7465780,7468260," At least that."
7468260,7470580," But they didn't add support for TLS 1.3."
7470580,7475620," Like, how many actually, how much software actually supports TLS 1.3 at this point?"
7475620,7477140," I think, I don't think that much."
7477140,7479940," And it's probably never gonna get it."
7479940,7481220," I don't know."
7481220,7481700," It depends."
7481700,7486980," So, um, all right."
7486980,7487620," It's pretty cool."
7487620,7489860," What do I want to do?"
7489860,7491620," What do I want to do?"
7491620,7497300," I want to write a simple application, uh, that utilizes this SSL socket from AWS"
7497300,7504340," and connects to, um, SSL or TLS, um, of a free node."
7504340,7504820," Right."
7504820,7508100," Just to check that we can actually connect to free node."
7508100,7516340," Uh, once we've done that, once we've done that, we can actually explore how to, um,"
7516340,7520500," do that, but from within the, uh, IRC, uh, IRC, uh, IRC."
7520500,7522020," Jiang, by the way."
7522020,7522340," Hello."
7522340,7524660," Have you been here the whole time?"
7524660,7526740," I don't remember saying hello to you, but hello."
7526740,7528020," Okay."
7528020,7528900," This is very interesting."
7528900,7530180," I like, I'm liking it so far."
7531620,7533620," This is very interesting exploration."
7533620,7539140," I especially like how I don't have a single plan for today's stream."
7539140,7539700," Seriously."
7539700,7542980," I have no idea what, what I'm supposed to do today."
7542980,7547220," I'm just like jumping between the libraries, just exploring different things."
7547220,7548820," And it's actually kind of cool."
7548820,7550500," Ignored by Zozin."
7550500,7551700," Did I ignore somebody?"
7551700,7553860," I'm sorry if I ignored anybody."
7553860,7555300," I didn't do that intentionally."
7555300,7558100," I don't do that intentionally sometimes."
7561220,7561540," Sorry."
7561540,7566420," If you want a plan, install Plan 9."
7566420,7570580," I want you to try Plan 9 at some point."
7570580,7571940," We'll see how it goes."
7571940,7573780," Maybe on one of these Friday streams."
7573780,7577700," Got banned for mentioning Plan 9."
7578260,7578980," All right."
7578980,7584180," By the way, does Go work on Plan 9?"
7584180,7585380," I think it should."
7585380,7586820," I think it should work on Plan 9."
7586820,7589460," Okay, I'll go."
7589460,7593700," So what do we have here?"
7593700,7595220," So this is the status thingy."
7595220,7599940," And I also want to gitignore super fast."
7599940,7601300," So this is ircbot."
7601300,7603460," Gitignore."
7603460,7605060," The build folder."
7605060,7606260," I think it's quite important."
7606260,7608340," So this build folder is going to be ignored."
7608340,7610180," Git status."
7610180,7614740," And we'll have to remove all of these binaries as well."
7614740,7616260," I don't think they fit here."
7616260,7618260," All right."
7618260,7622420," And let's do a committee committee."
7622420,7624420," So do I have a log?"
7624420,7626020," I don't even have any committee committee."
7626020,7628100," Okay, so let's actually do a first committee committee."
7628100,7630100," Gitignore server gpr."
7632660,7635460," src.wtttr."
7635460,7637300," So this is the status."
7637300,7639620," And yeah, this is basically what we have here."
7639620,7641460," And let's do commit."
7641460,7644020," Ready."
7644020,7647220," Ready, set, go."
7647220,7648660," Boom."
7648660,7652580," Do I need to actually put that on the GitHub?"
7652580,7654740," Is anyone interested in this entire thing?"
7654740,7657860," I can put it on GitHub if anyone is interested."
7657860,7659780," All right."
7659780,7663540," So, but I think I need to put, like, I need to clean it up a little bit."
7663540,7665140," Because right now we have two things here."
7665140,7667220," GitCleanFDX, by the way."
7668500,7669380," We have two things."
7669380,7671460," Wttr client."
7671460,7675140," Wttr client and some sort of a server."
7675140,7677380," Like a hello world server."
7677380,7681060," And yeah, so nothing special."
7681060,7686740," The next thing we're going to add there is going to be the SSL client of some sort."
7686740,7690980," Maybe before I'm going to submit all of that, I'm going to write like a readme."
7692500,7693380," You know what?"
7693380,7695700," First, I'm going to write a license."
7695700,7697860," First, I'm going to write a license."
7697860,7700740," And look at this legitness."
7700740,7701220," Look at that."
7701220,7702100," Boom."
7702100,7703540," And here we go."
7703540,7705380," Here's the license."
7705380,7707300," And it actually shows the correct year."
7707300,7709300," Absolutely fucking amazing."
7709300,7710180," So I'm going to save that."
7710180,7711380," And I'm going to close Emacs."
7711380,7714740," Yes, I opened Emacs specifically to do that."
7714740,7717860," Shut up."
7717860,7718740," Don't say anything."
7718740,7720420," Yes, I know it's dumb."
7722100,7722500," All right."
7722500,7724580," Read me."
7724580,7730580," What are we going to put here?"
7730580,7733140," Other experiments."
7733140,7735700," Experiments."
7735700,7739780," Just a small project."
7739780,7749220," Let's actually put a small fun project to experiment with other programming language."
7750820,7754900," Language and AWS."
7754900,7756180," Right."
7756180,7759780," So then we're going to leave the links to both of these things."
7759780,7761940," To both of these things."
7761940,7764340," So AWS is a framework."
7764340,7766500," It's a web framework for ADA."
7766500,7769940," It is not Amazon Web Services or anything like that."
7769940,7776580," So I know you want to make a funny joke saying that it's actually Amazon Services."
7776580,7777380," No, it is not."
7777380,7777460," No, it is not."
7777460,7779300," But the joke is funny."
7779300,7780100," Thank you very much."
7780100,7781140," I loved it."
7781140,7781460," Okay."
7781460,7784580," And other ADA programming language."
7784580,7787060," Why are you not using Emacs?"
7787060,7788340," Because Emacs sucks."
7788340,7791060," I hate this programming language."
7791060,7791780," It sucks."
7791780,7792580," It sucks."
7792580,7793300," It's bad."
7793300,7793940," I hate it."
7796180,7797380," Yes, that's why."
7797380,7800420," Does this answer satisfy you, by the way?"
7800420,7803700," So is that the official?"
7803700,7805380," I think that's it."
7805380,7805700," All right."
7805700,7808580," So cool."
7808580,7811860," Quick start."
7816100,7823380," So dependencies."
7823380,7827220," The first dependency is going to be GPR build."
7827220,7830580," You need GPR build to build these things."
7830580,7833700," You need GPR build to build GPR."
7833700,7836740," Okay."
7836740,7837460," GPR build."
7837460,7839060," So here it is."
7841460,7844900," And AWS, which is the this thing."
7844900,7854260," Right."
7854260,7856180," On Debian."
7856180,7859060," On Debian."
7861060,7865060," You can install all of the dependent."
7865060,7870420," Dependencies from the official."
7870420,7873220," Official repos."
7873220,7875060," Console."
7875060,7876340," Hola."
7876340,7879140," Sudo apt install."
7879140,7881620," GPR build and leap."
7881620,7882340," AWS."
7882340,7884820," I think it's 18 dev."
7884820,7885780," If I'm not mistaken."
7885780,7887140," Let me actually double check that."
7887140,7888260," Search leap."
7888260,7888980," AWS."
7891060,7891540," Mm-hmm."
7891540,7893300," Yeah."
7893300,7894580," So it's 18 dev."
7894580,7896740," All right."
7896740,7898980," So this is basically the dependencies."
7898980,7901460," So dependencies on build."
7901460,7902260," You can install that."
7902260,7905300," To build."
7905300,7908500," To build the."
7908500,7910980," Examples."
7910980,7912580," Do the following thing."
7912580,7913540," It's going to be console."
7913540,7916500," And it's just the GPR build."
7916500,7918580," It's I think it's P."
7919540,7921540," And the first one is going to be server GPR."
7921540,7923780," And the next one is going to be GPR build."
7923780,7925700," P."
7925700,7929220," WGTR GPR."
7929220,7930420," So we see for different projects."
7930420,7931220," We have different."
7931220,7934580," You know files that describe the projects."
7934580,7934980," And yeah."
7934980,7935700," That's pretty much it."
7943220,7944420," What is going on?"
7944420,7945140," Who are you?"
7945140,7950420," Okay."
7950420,7951140," I don't know who you are."
7951140,7953220," Ada."
7953220,7953700," Yes."
7953700,7954500," It is Ada."
7954500,7956660," Do you like this language?"
7956660,7958420," Is that a POG language?"
7958420,7960100," As the kids would say these days."
7960100,7962820," How do you do fellow zoomers?"
7962820,7963860," All right."
7963860,7965780," So I'm ready to do a committee committee."
7965780,7968020," I think we're ready to do a committee committee."
7968020,7969460," Add a license."
7969460,7972980," Release."
7972980,7974740," Under MIT."
7974740,7976020," Add."
7976020,7977780," Commit."
7977780,7978660," Add."
7978660,7980580," Add."
7980580,7980900," Read."
7980900,7983060," Cool."
7983060,7985860," So I'm going to move."
7986580,7987300," Add this thing."
7987300,7987780," Ada."
7987780,7988660," AWS."
7988660,7989300," Ada."
7989300,7989700," Probe."
7989700,7991380," Like this."
7991380,7991700," Ada."
7991700,7992020," Probe."
7992020,7996020," Just a small fun project."
7996020,7997860," Experiment with Ada."
7997860,7999060," Okay."
7999060,8001540," So are you guys ready."
8001540,8003380," To go to the GitHub."
8003380,8005380," And upload all of that goodness."
8016580,8018900," new Abike mode."
8018900,8020820," We actually have three new Abike modes."
8020820,8022500," The first one is Sodin POG."
8022500,8025700," And another one is Sodin SMUG."
8025700,8027540," And another one is Sodin RI."
8027540,8028500," There we go."
8028500,8029300," Which one do you like?"
8029300,8031140," So Ada."
8031140,8032500," Probe."
8032500,8036900," And this one is going to be just a small fun project to experiment with Ada."
8036900,8043940," Just a small fun project to experiment with Ada."
8043940,8045780," And it's going to be a public."
8045780,8046340," There we go."
8046580,8055140," So I want to add the remote now."
8055140,8059140," Remote add origin."
8059140,8063700," And git push origin master."
8063700,8064340," About that."
8064340,8070100," And there we go."
8070100,8070900," So here it is."
8070900,8072180," Here's the project."
8072180,8075380," So this is where we experiment with Ada."
8075380,8079780," So there's an explanation on how to use these things and stuff like that."
8079780,8081460," So maybe it's going to be useful for somebody."
8081460,8083300," We might as well actually update the project."
8084980,8098900," So update CMD project doing a small fun project to experiment with Ada."
8098900,8102900," Source code is this one."
8107380,8108260," The first one."
8108260,8112100," The most interesting thing is WTTR is just WTTR client."
8112100,8118340," And I'm thinking that I want to clean it up."
8118340,8127460," So let me actually open it."
8127460,8133220," So essentially what we probably want to do here is just to print only the response."
8133220,8133540," Right."
8133540,8135380," There's no reason to print anything else."
8135380,8136180," Right."
8136180,8137780," We're going to be printing only the response."
8137780,8138900," We're going to remove this thing."
8138900,8142900," And I wonder if we can inline all of that."
8142900,8144500," Maybe it doesn't make to inline all of that."
8144500,8147780," But that should be okay."
8147780,8153140," Another thing I want to also to do is to accept this thing."
8153140,8155700," The city from the command line."
8155700,8158980," Imagine using master branch in 2020."
8158980,8159460," Yeah."
8159460,8160100," Like it was."
8160100,8162420," I think it was automatically created by my git."
8163140,8164500," Like I personally don't care."
8164500,8166820," I would be happy to use main."
8166820,8169380," It's just the default for my git right now is master."
8169380,8171540," But yeah."
8171540,8174420," Maybe if I update git it will switch to something else."
8174420,8178260," I think you can change the default."
8178260,8179140," Wait a second."
8179140,8183300," Git change default branch."
8183300,8187540," How do you do that?"
8187540,8190020," So it's somewhere in the git config."
8191940,8192820," Git config."
8192820,8197700," They let you change it now."
8197700,8198500," Who are they?"
8198500,8199940," I'm not talking about github."
8199940,8200900," I'm talking about git."
8200900,8204420," Is there an energy for an branch to master domain?"
8204420,8208740," This is not what I'm talking about."
8208740,8209300," Oh my god."
8209300,8209700," People."
8209700,8211540," This is not what I'm talking about."
8211540,8212180," Holy shit."
8212180,8218180," Config."
8218180,8221220," This is what I'm talking about."
8222660,8224100," This is what I'm talking about."
8224100,8227940," An anonymous user is gifting five tier one subs."
8227940,8228340," Thank you."
8228340,8229940," Thank you so much an anonymous user."
8229940,8232020," And like I don't know who you are."
8232020,8233460," But thank you."
8233460,8233700," Thank you."
8233700,8233780," Thank you."
8233780,8234100," Thank you."
8234100,8236180," And everyone who got the sub."
8236180,8237220," Trefis."
8237220,8238740," Gil Christian."
8238740,8240660," TS Service."
8240660,8242500," AWS Sky."
8242500,8244180," Divorack."
8244180,8245380," Welcome to our epic."
8245380,8247460," Git branch community."
8247460,8249460," So."
8249460,8251860," What do I need to change it to?"
8251860,8257860," I think I'm okay with main."
8257860,8260020," Because main is actually super short."
8260020,8262980," And I already have reflexes to type main."
8262980,8264260," So I don't really want to."
8264260,8264580," Like."
8264580,8264900," I mean."
8264900,8268660," Like jokes like trunk or bachelor is very fun."
8268660,8269700," But."
8269700,8275140," Different names was going to screw up with my reflexes."
8275140,8275380," Right."
8276020,8276260," So."
8276260,8279060," And I already have reflexes to type."
8279060,8280420," To type main."
8280420,8283460," Because this is exactly what I do every time I start a C program."
8283460,8286180," So I have a pretty strong reflexes to just type main."
8286180,8287940," And it's shorter than master."
8287940,8291300," So switching from master to main is actually easier for me."
8291300,8294020," Than switching from master to trunk or anything else."
8294020,8296820," So that's why I'm going to actually stick with main."
8298740,8299300," All right."
8299300,8299540," So."
8299540,8302100," Where it is."
8302100,8303220," So this is what I want to do."
8303220,8304180," So the next time."
8304180,8306100," Right."
8306100,8308500," I'm going to create a new project."
8308500,8310340," It's going to automatically use main."
8310340,8310820," Hopefully."
8310820,8314580," Yeah."
8314580,8314900," Thank you."
8314900,8316580," Thank you so much for the support."
8316580,8317540," All right."
8317540,8319700," Let's continue."
8319700,8324100," Let's continue."
8324100,8325620," So here it is."
8325620,8329380," And how can I get the command line arguments."
8329380,8332420," For the."
8332420,8334980," For the other program."
8334980,8336900," I remember I did that in AOC."
8336900,8338900," So let's actually go to AOC 2020."
8338900,8340900," And in here."
8340900,8345060," We should be able to find something."
8345060,8346900," Oh my God."
8346900,8347620," Another sub."
8347620,8348900," Oh my God."
8348900,8349380," There we go."
8354100,8356500," It is the death of the month."
8356500,8359220," You are restarting out of notion."
8359220,8361300," Hope you enjoy."
8361300,8377940," Thank you."
8384100,8389380," We actually had two subs."
8389380,8390100," Simultaneously."
8390100,8391140," I didn't even realize that."
8391140,8391540," So."
8391540,8392980," There was a Shazovok sub."
8392980,8394660," And there was a Header's car."
8394660,8397220," Thank you so much for 16 months."
8397220,8398500," Of Twitch Prime subscription."
8398500,8398900," Thank you."
8398900,8399140," Thank you."
8399140,8399380," Thank you."
8399380,8399460," Thank you."
8399460,8399940," Beautiful."
8399940,8400820," Beautiful song."
8400820,8401860," I really loved it."
8401860,8402740," And Header's car."
8402740,8404660," Thank you so much for tier one subscription."
8404660,8406420," Your first subscription by the way."
8406420,8407220," Welcome."
8407220,8407620," Welcome."
8407620,8408020," Welcome."
8408020,8408180," Welcome."
8408180,8408500," Welcome."
8408500,8409620," Alrighty."
8409620,8411380," Yep."
8411380,8412340," So many subs today."
8412340,8412820," I don't know."
8412820,8414500," Like I'm not even doing anything special."
8414500,8416740," Is that the magic of Ada?"
8416740,8418340," Should I program more in Ada?"
8418340,8419700," I guess so."
8419700,8422420," People seem to like it."
8422420,8423140," Okay."
8423140,8425460," So I'm going to continue programming later."
8425460,8426740," Because it's a pretty cool language."
8426740,8427300," Not going to lie."
8427300,8429780," XUA39."
8429780,8432180," Thank you for tier one sub."
8432180,8435060," Thank you so much."
8435060,8436500," Do you guys really like Ada?"
8436500,8438100," Is that interesting language?"
8438100,8439780," Like, I mean, I do like it as well."
8439780,8440420," So, yeah."
8440420,8442500," That makes sense."
8442500,8442820," Thank you."
8442820,8444980," Thank you so much for tier one sub."
8444980,8445940," Your first sub, by the way."
8445940,8448180," Welcome to our epic Ada club."
8448180,8448740," That's right."
8448740,8451620," Alrighty."
8451620,8452260," Alrighty."
8452260,8452740," Alrighty."
8452740,8455460," Nice thumbnail, by the way."
8455460,8457220," Okay."
8457220,8461140," So how do you grab the command line arguments?"
8461140,8462660," How do you grab the command line arguments?"
8462660,8464180," I remember that you do that."
8464180,8466500," Yeah."
8466500,8466900," There we go."
8466900,8468580," So there is like argument count."
8468580,8470660," Argument count."
8470660,8475700," And then there is an argument function."
8475700,8476740," There's two functions."
8476740,8478740," Argument count and argument function."
8478740,8480020," Okay."
8481620,8484340," And I think you also need to import something for that."
8484340,8484500," Yeah."
8484500,8486500," This is essentially what you need to import."
8486500,8487780," Essentially what I want to do."
8487780,8494580," I want to accept the name of the city as the command line argument for WTTR client."
8494580,8495460," Right."
8495460,8500100," So by itself, this is kind of like a useless, kind of useless program."
8500100,8506100," But we're writing it just to like learn how to do, how to program in Ada."
8506100,8509700," And that, in my opinion, makes sense."
8510420,8510820," All right."
8510820,8513540," I'm going to move this thing here."
8513540,8516260," And let's actually go down a little bit."
8516260,8518180," And we need to take a look at the argument count."
8518180,8523060," So we need to accept at least one argument count."
8523060,8523540," Right."
8523540,8525620," So we need at least one of them."
8525620,8531620," So if argument count is less than one."
8531620,8532180," Right."
8532180,8535780," Then we have to throw some sort of an error."
8535780,8536020," Right."
8536020,8539380," And if I remember correctly, that's how we do that."
8539380,8541620," But I don't remember how to throw an error."
8541620,8544740," Is there something Ada?"
8544740,8548020," Error."
8548020,8551540," Crash with error."
8551540,8553380," Or maybe just error."
8553380,8555220," Error function."
8555220,8559300," So as far as I know, yeah, error handling."
8559300,8562180," Ada supports exceptions."
8562180,8562500," Right."
8562500,8568020," So probably the canonical way of failing with an error would be to throw exception."
8568020,8568340," Right."
8568340,8570420," And throwing an exception is probably something like a rise."
8570420,8571380," Right."
8571380,8572580," And you can have."
8572580,8573380," Yeah."
8573380,8577380," You probably have to define your own exceptions and then fail with them."
8577380,8579060," Okay."
8579060,8580420," So let's actually go ahead and do that."
8580420,8581860," I can do something like."
8583700,8589460," not enough arguments is an exception."
8589460,8590340," Right."
8590340,8591460," So this is an exception."
8591460,8598980," And if you have argument count less than one, we raise not enough arguments."
8598980,8599700," Does it make sense?"
8599700,8602500," Using exceptions."
8602500,8602820," Okay."
8602820,8603460," I'm out."
8603460,8604020," Anaboth."
8604020,8606420," You're a JavaScript developer."
8608180,8609060," Oh, to be fair."
8609060,8613140," JavaScript developers these days actually try to avoid exceptions, I think."
8613140,8614420," Yeah."
8614420,8618900," I think they are all encapsulated in like in promises and stuff like that."
8618900,8619860," I'm sorry for explaining."
8619860,8620420," I didn't mean to."
8620420,8622340," But I mean, come on."
8622340,8623940," Exceptions are everywhere."
8623940,8628500," There's not that many languages where you won't find exceptions."
8628500,8632580," So those languages are pretty exceptional."
8632580,8634340," Whatever."
8634340,8635220," Anyway."
8635220,8638980," So, yeah."
8638980,8643140," So if you don't have enough arguments, let's actually see if it's going to work or not."
8643140,8645540," So we're going to be in GPR build."
8645540,8647060," What's your opinion on TypeScript?"
8647060,8654100," I hate it."
8654100,8655060," I fucking hate it."
8655060,8656180," The worst language ever."
8657380,8658260," Is that a good answer?"
8658260,8659300," Is that what you're going to hear?"
8659300,8662900," C is better than TypeScript."
8662900,8667380," Right."
8667380,8667940," Let's move on."
8667940,8672020," It's not like the schedule page is written in TypeScript."
8672020,8673060," Anyway."
8673060,8674580," All right."
8674580,8677380," Build."
8677380,8679220," Oh, you have to actually create a build."
8679220,8680020," Oh, holy shit."
8680020,8680820," We found an error."
8680820,8682020," Okay."
8682020,8686260," So, and the problem is that you cannot add the empty folder"
8686260,8687380," folder to the Git."
8687380,8689700," What's your opinion on Ada?"
8689700,8692660," Worst language ever."
8692660,8695060," Okay."
8695060,8703380," You cannot add empty folders to Git."
8708100,8711460," So, and how people usually add empty folder."
8711460,8711780," Yeah."
8711780,8712020," Give."
8712020,8714180," You're right."
8714180,8714500," Git."
8714500,8714740," Keep."
8714740,8716100," We're going to touch."
8716100,8718100," We're going to touch it gently."
8718100,8720420," And then go."
8720420,8721940," So now we have this thing here."
8721940,8726660," And that will enable us with adding this thing here."
8726660,8728580," Cool."
8729940,8731380," Wait a fucking second."
8731380,8734500," Oh, shit."
8734500,8735220," I'm an idiot."
8735220,8738740," Yeah, I'm an idiot."
8738740,8742100," I Git ignored it."
8742100,8745380," Okay."
8749700,8756900," So, like the reason why I Git ignored it is because I got used to the fact that the build folder is"
8756900,8759220," usually created by the build tools."
8759220,8760740," Right."
8760740,8766100," It's kind of unusual when the build tool requires the build folder, but it doesn't create it."
8766100,8772340," So, which makes it kind of difficult to Git ignore all of the garbage."
8774180,8782740," So, essentially, now what I need to Git ignore instead, I actually have to Git ignore everything"
8782740,8785860," within the build, but not the build itself."
8785860,8787460," And I think I can do it like that."
8787460,8787700," Right."
8787700,8791060," So, but that will Git ignore Git keep as well."
8791060,8798500," But I think it's not that big of an issue because I can add Git keep regardless of this"
8798500,8799940," being a Git ignore."
8799940,8800180," Right."
8800180,8802500," I think this is how it works."
8803380,8803780," Okay."
8803780,8805620," So, this is what we have."
8805620,8811140," And I can always try to add build Git keep."
8811140,8813140," Right."
8813140,8815540," The following paths are ignored by one of the..."
8815540,8815860," Yeah."
8815860,8817620," And I can actually force that."
8817620,8819140," There we go."
8819140,8822260," Even though it's Git ignored, I still can add it."
8822260,8822580," Okay."
8822580,8823300," That makes sense."
8823300,8826420," Oh, you can actually do like..."
8826420,8827460," Okay."
8827460,8828180," I didn't know that."
8828180,8829860," Let me try that."
8829860,8832900," How do I Git reset?"
8833700,8834740," Can I just reset?"
8834740,8840900," Git status."
8840900,8841620," Yeah."
8841620,8841860," Okay."
8841860,8842660," I reset it."
8842660,8844180," Git ignore."
8844180,8846100," Then..."
8846100,8847380," Can I do build?"
8847380,8850020," Git keep."
8850020,8852020," Okay."
8852020,8853060," Git status."
8855140,8855700," Okay."
8855700,8859380," And then if I add, it's this."
8859380,8861540," Perfect."
8861540,8861860," Thank you."
8861860,8864500," Thank you everyone who actually suggested all this stuff."
8864500,8865300," This is actually pretty cool."
8874820,8875060," Yeah."
8875060,8877140," It is used only in military stuff."
8877140,8881460," Well, I mean, it's also used by some enthusiasts and stuff like that."
8881460,8884980," But its primary usage is the US military department."
8884980,8888900," And it was designed specifically for US military department."
8888900,8894580," Also, I think I need to Git ignore the editor garbage as well."
8894580,8895620," So, let's quickly do that."
8895620,8901140," So, it's going to be swap."
8901140,8902340," Git status."
8902340,8904660," All right."
8904660,8907620," Add key to ignore."
8911300,8917140," Introduce the build folder."
8917140,8920580," And now, if I try to do gpr build p."
8920580,8923300," Wttr gpr."
8923300,8924980," Is this going to work?"
8926180,8926740," Okay."
8926740,8929540," So, when it should generate some garbage in build."
8929540,8932340," But this garbage should be git ignored."
8932340,8932740," Perfect."
8932740,8934660," I'm absolutely happy."
8934660,8936980," So, wttr build."
8936980,8938100," Wttr."
8938100,8940340," And if I try to do that, wttr."
8940340,8941460," Not enough arguments."
8941460,8943780," Should be s in my opinion."
8943780,8945780," Not enough arguments."
8945780,8947780," Cool."
8947780,8952660," But if I provide Novosibirsk."
8953860,8954340," Okay."
8954340,8958020," It does perform the request."
8958020,8959300," I think that's cool."
8959300,8961940," So, how are we going to do all of that?"
8961940,8966580," I think I'm going to just do something like this."
8966580,8969460," And concatenate this stuff."
8969460,8973460," So, it's going to be argument one."
8973460,8975380," Like this."
8975380,8978980," And you can use whatever city you want."
8978980,8983780," So, it's a very simple client for Wttr."
8983780,8985620," that uses AWS."
8985620,8988260," Very straightforward and very simple."
8988260,8989940," All right."
8989940,8992740," So, gpr, wttr."
8992740,8995780," And it does not compile."
8995780,8997540," Because I did a fucky-wucky."
8997540,9001460," Wttr, adp, 14."
9001460,9003380," It has to be s."
9008500,9008900," Cool."
9008900,9013620," Build this one."
9013620,9016980," And I can provide Novosibirsk."
9016980,9018980," Cool."
9018980,9021700," So, let's provide other cities."
9021700,9022740," Moscow."
9022740,9025220," I think."
9025220,9026980," Unknown location."
9026980,9029060," Moscow is an unknown location."
9029060,9032980," That's very interesting."
9032980,9035140," Is that because it has to be capitalized?"
9035140,9037140," Okay."
9037140,9040340," What's fine is that?"
9040340,9042260," Can I have, like, New York?"
9042260,9045060," It's all unknown location."
9045060,9046980," Only Novosibirsk is unknown."
9047380,9047700," Okay."
9047700,9053460," All right."
9053460,9056740," So, I'm going to copy-paste it, by the way."
9056740,9059140," Because I'm not sure if I'll be able to type it properly."
9067220,9069380," Maybe, oh, shit."
9069380,9073300," Maybe I have to, like, URL encode it."
9073300,9075620," Maybe that's what needs to be done."
9075620,9079700," Classified Moscow location."
9079700,9081140," Amsterdam."
9081140,9093860," All right."
9093860,9095140," So, that's very interesting."
9096260,9099380," What the fuck?"
9099380,9102100," So, I'm really confused."
9102100,9107300," So, we probably need to do some sort of encoding, right?"
9107300,9112500," But it shows GPS location."
9112500,9114580," I have no idea what the fuck is GPS location."
9114580,9117300," What if it is a GPS location?"
9117300,9118980," It probably doesn't have an access to that."
9118980,9123620," So, I want to try"
9125940,9129220," To URL encode the input."
9129220,9131860," And this is something that we have to do anyway, right?"
9131860,9134340," So, we'll have to URL encode it anyway."
9134340,9136340," So, let's see."
9136340,9139060," But the question is,"
9139060,9142020," how can we even find the URL encoding?"
9142020,9143300," I can try to do something like this."
9144660,9151540," ""GREP encode"", ""URL encode""."
9151540,9152980," Cool."
9152980,9153220," Okay."
9153220,9153940," Here it is."
9153940,9155940," So, in AWS parameters,"
9155940,9158740," we have URL."
9158740,9158900," Okay."
9158900,9160820," So, there's AWS URL."
9160820,9161940," I think that's what we need here."
9163300,9163860," What's that?"
9163860,9164180," What's that?"
9164180,9165140," This is, uh-huh."
9165140,9168820," This is the bot."
9168820,9170500," And I'm going to split this thing here."
9170500,9177860," AWS URL."
9178580,9179060," Oh my god."
9179060,9186420," ""URL ADS encode""."
9186420,9187860," Aha."
9187860,9191220," So, maybe function encode."
9191220,9192500," Oh, there we go."
9192500,9193540," That was actually super easy."
9193860,9196980," So, what the fuck?"
9196980,9198420," It was easier than I expected."
9198420,9199380," Yeah."
9199380,9202340," There's literally a module, AWS URL,"
9202340,9205860," and it has a function encode that accepts a string and returns you a string."
9205860,9208260," Encode string into URL save form."
9208260,9210820," Many characters are forbidden, blah, blah, blah."
9210820,9212900," So, that was actually pretty fucking straightforward."
9212900,9213380," What the fuck?"
9213380,9214980," Okay."
9214980,9216260," Can we do something like this?"
9216260,9217860," I want to define like a URL,"
9217860,9219620," which is going to be a string."
9219620,9221220," It's going to be a string."
9222100,9226580," And it's going to be with AWS URL."
9226580,9228020," So, I think..."
9228020,9229700," It's..."
9229700,9231460," Capitalization actually doesn't matter,"
9231460,9233300," because it's case-insensitive."
9233300,9235620," And then we do encode."
9235620,9237060," And what I want to do here"
9237060,9241220," is I want to encode specific..."
9241220,9242180," Oh, shit."
9242180,9243460," You have to be super careful,"
9243460,9246260," because you cannot access the arguments"
9246260,9249700," before you check whether you have enough arguments, right?"
9250420,9253140," So, URL is going to be something like this."
9253140,9255060," And here, we accept argument,"
9255060,9257460," argument one, right?"
9257460,9262420," And then here is going to be simply HTTPS WTTR in."
9262420,9269940," And it's going to be this format four, right?"
9269940,9274260," And afterwards, I can just do something like this."
9274900,9275940," Just remove all of that."
9275940,9277620," And I'm using URL."
9277620,9278980," So, on top of that,"
9278980,9282180," it would be nice to log the URL"
9282180,9286660," to confirm that we didn't do any significant ""fucky wucky"","
9286660,9287380," if you know what I mean."
9287380,9294100," Put line requesting, requesting"
9296420,9298100," URL, right?"
9298100,9301860," And yeah, let's put it like this."
9301860,9303220," Cool."
9303220,9305860," So, we're checking that we have enough arguments."
9305860,9307460," We're constructing a new URL."
9307460,9309940," We're encoding the part that is provided by the user,"
9309940,9313700," so the user cannot inject any, you know, shenanigans in there."
9313700,9315060," And then we also print this thing."
9315060,9317380," And then we request,"
9317380,9318660," and then we print the message body."
9318660,9319300," Seems pretty good."
9319300,9320020," Seems pretty good."
9320580,9323700," So, GPR build, WTTR."
9323700,9330180," Okay."
9330180,9333620," Unconstrained subtype not allowed."
9333620,9334820," Need initialization."
9334820,9336500," Oh, shit."
9336500,9337700," That's very interesting."
9337700,9341620," So, it's at 13."
9341620,9346420," So, the thing about strings in Ada is actually very interesting,"
9346420,9350900," is that they have to be constrained to a particular size all the time."
9350900,9352980," And if you don't initialize them properly,"
9352980,9357700," so Ada doesn't really know its size."
9357700,9361380," Ada doesn't know its size."
9361380,9362580," So, as far as I know,"
9362580,9368820," but what's funny is that you can always defer the declaration of the variable"
9368820,9371460," until you know the size of the variable,"
9371460,9373860," even though if the size is known at runtime."
9374420,9376580," So, you can do something like this."
9376580,9377620," You can do declare"
9377620,9382420," and put string like that."
9382420,9384340," Right."
9384340,9386900," And then you're going to have the block begin."
9386900,9388980," Where are you going to do all of that?"
9388980,9390580," So, it's basically like a way."
9390580,9399460," It's basically a way to define variables in any place."
9399460,9404100," Like, you know, in C, you can declare a variable in any place in the body of the function."
9404420,9406100," It's the same in Ada."
9406100,9408660," It's only you have to use a special block declare,"
9408660,9411380," which declares the variable for this specific block."
9411380,9412980," And I think this will work."
9412980,9416100," Because if you define a string like that, it has to be initialized."
9416100,9420100," And we cannot initialize it before we check the argument."
9420100,9421700," So, that's why we first check the argument."
9421700,9423540," So, only then we define URL."
9423540,9424820," And only then it's going to work."
9425620,9430340," And if we try to compile that, it does in fact compiles."
9430340,9434820," Like, I'm always surprised how much sense this language makes."
9434820,9438500," It's just like the semantic is consistent."
9438500,9442900," That's what enables me with just guessing how to fix things."
9442900,9444820," Because I never read anything about Ada."
9444820,9447940," I never read any book about Ada or any documentation."
9447940,9449620," I'm just looking at the semantic."
9449620,9451780," And semantic is pretty much consistent."
9451780,9455380," Which makes it super easy to learn this language."
9455380,9456500," At least for me."
9456500,9457540," I don't know how."
9457540,9460820," Like, if maybe you have to have some sort of a background in programming to"
9460820,9463460," to learn this language easily."
9463460,9468660," I'm not sure how difficult it is for the new developers."
9468660,9473060," But I like the consistency of semantic."
9473060,9476180," And it just makes it like easy to guess what's going to happen."
9476180,9476500," Okay."
9476500,9477380," Wttr."
9477380,9477940," Right."
9477940,9479460," So, it's going to be a build."
9479460,9482500," Wttr."
9482500,9484100," Not enough arguments."
9484100,9485380," If you provide something like this."
9485380,9486500," It does that."
9486500,9489700," And if I try to do Novosibirsk."
9489700,9493060," And Moscow."
9493060,9495060," Okay."
9495060,9496180," So, it doesn't know that."
9496180,9501940," So, let's try this one."
9501940,9503300," And as you can see."
9503300,9507140," Like, it actually properly URL encoded it."
9507140,9508340," But it still doesn't work."
9508340,9510100," I don't know what exactly is wrong with that."
9510100,9511540," Maybe it's something with the format."
9513220,9514420," No location place."
9514420,9515220," Please try."
9515220,9517780," It's really strange."
9517780,9519620," Sponsor stream."
9519620,9521140," Nobody sponsored me, by the way."
9521140,9524740," Try to open it in browser."
9524740,9525860," It's a good idea, actually."
9525860,9529380," Huh."
9533060,9546580," It's maybe it has something to do with the agent."
9546580,9550580," It's maybe it has something to do with the agent."
9550580,9556820," Maybe it has something to do with the agent."
9558020,9559460," Class 8 extends past."
9559460,9559940," Yes."
9559940,9561780," That's how it works, by the way."
9561780,9562900," That's how you do that."
9562900,9567700," I think it may have something to do with the user agent."
9567700,9569140," Maybe I have to set it to something."
9569140,9570980," All right."
9570980,9573780," So, let's actually explore if I have to do that somehow."
9573780,9575380," All right."
9575380,9576900," So, it's going to be AWS."
9576900,9581300," I think it's a client."
9581300,9582580," Hotplug."
9582580,9586580," S function."
9586580,9587460," Get."
9587460,9589140," User."
9591060,9592500," I think you have to provide the user."
9592500,9595780," Let's go ahead and provide the user."
9595780,9596820," User."
9596820,9599540," God damn it."
9599540,9603540," What the fuck am I?"
9603540,9605460," Something is wrong with me."
9605460,9605860," User."
9605860,9607940," Okay."
9607940,9609940," Your mom."
9609940,9611060," Is that a good user?"
9611060,9612020," User agent?"
9612020,9612900," I don't know."
9612900,9617860," Maybe it should not contain any, you know, capitalized things."
9620100,9620500," All right."
9620500,9622100," So, maybe that will fix it."
9622100,9623140," Let's find out."
9623140,9626100," GPR."
9626100,9634580," Didn't work."
9634580,9639620," Do we have anything that's important here?"
9639620,9643940," Because somehow he had a similar situation, similar problem in his bot."
9643940,9647060," And I'm pretty sure he solved it and he forgot how to solve it."
9647060,9647860," How he solved it."
9649300,9651700," So, it's really strange because here it works."
9651700,9653700," We can try to see what browser sends."
9653700,9658340," Hopefully, it's not going to expose me."
9658340,9662580," I want to be a little bit more careful with this shit."
9662580,9663060," I'm sorry."
9663060,9666500," I want to be slightly more careful."
9666500,9667060," Oh my god."
9667060,9667940," It's such a..."
9667940,9669540," It's a small display."
9669540,9670820," I don't see shit."
9670820,9672020," Chat, I don't see shit."
9672020,9672340," Okay."
9676420,9677940," So, there is a remote address."
9677940,9681220," Does it show the local address?"
9681220,9682900," I don't think it shows the local address."
9682900,9685140," Request headers."
9685140,9696740," So, it uses user agent like, you know, the classical browser user agent."
9696740,9700740," Maybe if I use the same user agent, it will work for me."
9700740,9703940," We can try."
9703940,9710020," And by that, I mean just use this as a user agent."
9712900,9713380," Why not?"
9713380,9713460," Why not?"
9713460,9717780," We can try to do that."
9717780,9719060," So, this could be a string."
9719060,9722420," But we will have to assign it to something."
9722420,9724740," User agent."
9724740,9726820," String."
9727860,9730820," I think it has to be like a constant string."
9730820,9735380," But I don't remember how to properly define it though."
9735380,9737780," Yeah."
9737780,9742020," So, and this is the user and..."
9742020,9747380," Your mom."
9747380,9748500," There we go."
9748500,9752100," User agent."
9752100,9754500," Okay."
9754500,9756020," So, let's see if it's going to work or not."
9756020,9762020," It actually compiled."
9762020,9763460," So, I guessed it correctly."
9763460,9765620," So, let's go here."
9765620,9767620," And it still doesn't work."
9767620,9773700," Wait a second."
9773700,9777300," What is the status of the response?"
9777780,9785700," Put line AWS response status code response."
9785700,9786340," And I think..."
9786340,9792820," There's another thing that you have to do."
9792820,9794180," Like you won't be able to print it."
9799860,9801060," You won't be able to print it."
9801060,9803300," Okay."
9803300,9804900," So, missing argument."
9804900,9808020," To call standard string."
9808020,9809300," And this is status call."
9809300,9814580," I think we have to do with AWS status, I think."
9814580,9815780," But I don't remember."
9815780,9816740," Is that a client?"
9816740,9819140," I think it's messages."
9819140,9819620," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
9819620,9822500," AWS"
9825220,9826420," Status maybe."
9826420,9826740," Image."
9826740,9831380," I forgot which one was that."
9831380,9835540," Status, not set."
9835540,9838020," Yes, it was status."
9838020,9841700," So, you take the status and you take the image."
9841700,9843220," And do we have a status?"
9843220,9844980," We don't."
9844980,9848980," So, with AWS status."
9848980,9850740," So, this is what we need to do."
9850740,9852100," GPR build."
9852100,9854820," It's my IP."
9854820,9856340," No, it's my IP."
9856340,9859380," Image not declared in status."
9859380,9863460," Okay."
9863460,9871140," Let's open messages."
9871140,9873940," AWS messages."
9873940,9877140," Status code."
9880420,9882740," Function, status, code."
9882740,9889300," Oh, it's in messages, I see."
9889300,9905700," I was hoping that maybe the status would be redirect."
9905700,9906900," But it never worked."
9906900,9908020," So, maybe."
9908020,9910340," AWTTR."
9910340,9913860," Let's take a look at this thing."
9913860,9918420," Is there any documentation?"
9918420,9920980," Like, why it would return a non-location?"
9920980,9922420," Okay."
9922420,9923540," It is on GitHub."
9923540,9926980," Did they ever, like, discuss that?"
9926980,9928260," Like, this is so weird."
9928900,9931220," Like, why would it do that?"
9931220,9934980," And on top of that, what if I try to do that via the curl?"
9934980,9941300," What am I doing incorrectly?"
9941300,9941940," Holy fuck."
9941940,9942820," This is so bad."
9942820,9944500," And this is so infuriating."
9944500,9946820," Like, don't make services like that, please."
9946820,9948260," It's so bad."
9952340,9954180," unknown location."
9954180,9956740," Was that ever discussed before?"
9956740,9959140," I'm pretty sure somebody created an issue about that."
9959140,9962340," Somebody has to create an issue for that."
9962340,9965060," Page not displayed for some unknown locations."
9965780,9966820," So, there is such bug."
9966820,9969380," Just use JS."
9969380,9972660," Uh..."
9972660,9977220," AnoloCash gets some..."
9977220,9980020," Um..."
9980020,9986660," So, it's a bug of the servers."
9986660,9988740," It's a bug of the servers, right?"
9990260,9992340," Isn't there some protection against the bots?"
9992340,9992820," I don't know."
9992820,10002260," We're processing more of the million, uh..."
10002260,10002820," If you go..."
10002820,10005300," Okay."
10005300,10007380," Which explains empty response, curl."
10007380,10011380," The allocation problem yesterday was caused by the problem in the..."
10011380,10017780," But..."
10020260,10022260," Uh..."
10022260,10034420," Okay."
10034420,10036260," So, there's nothing I can do about that."
10036260,10037780," It seems like a bug."
10037780,10039220," It's such a weird bug."
10039220,10040100," Like, holy shit."
10040100,10041460," Um..."
10041460,10041860," Anyway."
10041860,10046660," Apparently, I'm just wasting my time, like, looking into that."
10046660,10048260," Um..."
10048260,10048820," Okay."
10048820,10049860," Couldn't care less."
10050260,10054180," Oh, nice service, by the way."
10054180,10056180," Thank you so much."
10056180,10059220," Holy fuck."
10059220,10059540," Okay."
10059540,10064660," Okay."
10064660,10069780," So, I just want to commit whatever I have for this thing."
10072260,10074340," Git add status."
10074340,10088020," ""Accept location via CLI arguments in WTTR""."
10088020,10088180," Okay."
10088180,10091060," So, I cleaned up the first example."
10091060,10094020," So, I also want you to clean up the second example, right?"
10094020,10095540," Because this is WTTR."
10095540,10096580," I might as well actually..."
10096580,10099460," Put something..."
10099460,10100100," Something here."
10100100,10102580," So, this is what we're going to do here."
10102580,10103620," So, then..."
10103620,10108260," Build WTTR Nova Sibirsk."
10108260,10109460," So, this is how we do that."
10110420,10111860," So, and in here, um..."
10111860,10113140," Yeah."
10113140,10114100," So, we have a server."
10114100,10117380," But server is not called server in here."
10117380,10118660," So, it's called main."
10118660,10121780," I think I will need to rename."
10121780,10122900," I will need to rename it."
10122900,10125460," Oh, what's up, Gil?"
10125460,10127380," Well, I don't remember if I say hi to you."
10127380,10127780," Welcome."
10127780,10130820," Server ADB."
10130820,10131700," Right."
10131700,10133300," I'm going to rename it to server ADB."
10133300,10137060," And because of that, I also have to rename this to the server."
10137060,10138260," Cool."
10140420,10144580," And in here, why not open weather?"
10144580,10146100," I don't know."
10146100,10148900," It's just like, I use WTT..."
10148900,10150580," Like, I know about WTTR."
10150580,10153060," I know that Herrherts and Plots uses WTTR."
10153060,10154340," And it's super easy to query it."
10154340,10156260," You can query it through curl."
10156260,10159460," And I don't know any other options."
10159460,10164660," And I just wanted a target to test the AWS client."
10164660,10165380," Does it make sense?"
10165380,10168020," So, it was just like an accident."
10170020,10173060," So, I knew about this thing and I just used it."
10173060,10177940," So, if I knew about open weather or accum weather, I'd probably use them."
10177940,10179540," But it's just like a test."
10179540,10179780," Okay."
10179780,10180500," Cool."
10180500,10183300," So, what's another thing?"
10183300,10185220," Server GPR."
10185220,10188420," And the main here is going to be a server."
10188420,10191220," So, this server doesn't really do much."
10191220,10194260," I think it just gives you hello world."
10196260,10200660," Now, if I try to do GPR build P server GPR."
10200660,10204020," It should build things."
10204020,10207620," Build example."
10207620,10208580," It's actually not example."
10208580,10209620," It's a server."
10209620,10209860," And..."
10209860,10213620," Excuse me."
10213620,10214500," Where is the server?"
10214500,10216340," Didn't I build it?"
10216340,10220100," Didn't I build it?"
10220100,10220740," Excuse me."
10220740,10224260," So, main..."
10224260,10226340," Ah!"
10226340,10227300," I know what happened."
10227300,10233620," I forgot to set the object deer for it to be build."
10233620,10238980," And it actually vomited all of its guts right into the root of the project."
10242340,10242820," Classic."
10242820,10244500," All right."
10244500,10244740," So..."
10244740,10246580," All right."
10246580,10247940," Let's try to fix that."
10247940,10249300," Essentially, what we need to do here..."
10249300,10250740," Right."
10250740,10251620," I need to open that."
10251620,10253540," I need to split that."
10253540,10257140," And I need to steal some of the options from WTTR GPR."
10257140,10258260," Right."
10258260,10260580," And the option is object deer."
10260580,10261220," So, it's..."
10261220,10261380," Yeah."
10261380,10265540," By default, it actually like puts things into the root."
10265540,10268900," And to prevent it to do that, you have to add this option."
10268900,10269700," It's quite important."
10271460,10271700," Yep."
10271700,10272820," All right."
10272820,10274900," So, hopefully, that will do the trick."
10274900,10276580," And let's try to rebuild all that."
10276580,10278900," Nice build system."
10278900,10279460," Yeah, I know."
10279460,10282820," So, minus P."
10282820,10293060," Server ADB is not a source of a project server."
10293060,10295540," Problems with the mains..."
10295540,10295860," Really?"
10295860,10297540," One more time."
10299540,10303060," SRC main use server ADB."
10303060,10305620," Oh!"
10305620,10306820," It was removed with..."
10306820,10307140," Okay."
10307140,10307540," I see."
10307540,10309540," Classic."
10309540,10311460," Content classic."
10311460,10314500," Reset SRC main ADB."
10316820,10318740," Check out."
10318740,10320500," Yeah."
10320500,10324660," And then let's go here."
10324660,10327220," Move main ADB server ADB."
10327220,10332420," Server ADB has to be also server."
10332420,10335620," Okay."
10335620,10337780," Can we finally do that?"
10337780,10339380," This is not what I want."
10339940,10340580," GPR build."
10340580,10348420," And it seems to be working in the build server."
10348420,10350340," Yeah."
10350340,10352900," You can now go to localhost 8080."
10352900,10354260," And it says hello world for me."
10354260,10357220," And it was served by an ADA code."
10358580,10360660," It was served by an ADA code."
10360660,10368580," So, another interesting thing is that I don't quite understand how to make it an infinite loop."
10368580,10369780," Right."
10369780,10371380," So, we'll need to explore that."
10371380,10377220," So, there's a delay here."
10377220,10379780," If I don't do any delay..."
10379780,10381140," Oh, this is not how we do that."
10381140,10384740," If I don't do any delay, what's going to happen?"
10388500,10391220," So, build server."
10391220,10393380," It instantly..."
10393380,10393860," Oh, okay."
10393860,10396660," So, it also says that this address is already in use."
10396660,10398180," Probably because I did CTRL + C."
10398180,10401380," Probably because I did CTRL + C."
10401380,10401700," Okay."
10401700,10406900," Okay."
10406900,10413540," You can always probably change this port to something else."
10415060,10415780," Let me do it like this."
10415780,10416180," Port."
10416180,10418660," Positive."
10418660,10422100," And just put this thing somewhere here."
10422100,10426260," Oh, it uses the port."
10426260,10427220," Ah."
10427220,10428980," I see."
10428980,10431300," So, I probably have to specify the port in here."
10431300,10434980," So, we're going to use the default port."
10434980,10437060," Let me put it here."
10437060,10442020," So, here's the default port."
10442980,10445860," And in here, it's going to be just a port."
10445860,10448900," And I can make port port."
10448900,10450660," You see, it's basically like in Python."
10450660,10455300," You have keyword arguments and stuff like that."
10455300,10456580," And it's pretty convenient."
10456580,10458180," It's actually, in fact, pretty convenient."
10458180,10460180," All right."
10460180,10462260," So, can I do now something like this?"
10462260,10464820," So, it's a little bit easier for us to build."
10464820,10465460," Is it going to build?"
10465460,10466260," I think it's building."
10466260,10467460," Okay."
10468660,10472020," And it stops almost immediately without any delay."
10472020,10475540," But what if I never call shutdown?"
10475540,10480020," Oh, probably shutdown is important for closing sockets and stuff like that."
10480020,10482500," All right."
10482500,10488260," Let's take a look at some of the examples in AWS."
10488260,10492500," Maybe in AWS, they have an example with an infinite loop."
10492500,10498660," Because it's kind of dumb, in my opinion, if it's impossible to have just an infinite loop,"
10498660,10499940," that like infinite service."
10499940,10501700," Like, why would you not have that?"
10504180,10505860," Where are the examples?"
10505860,10506660," There are demos."
10506660,10507060," Okay."
10507060,10508020," So, here they are."
10508020,10509940," Hello world."
10509940,10510660," Hot plug."
10510660,10511620," HTTPS."
10511620,10518660," Upload."
10518660,10519140," Okay."
10519140,10520980," Let's take a look at the upload."
10520980,10524580," Maybe that one is going to have that."
10524580,10526500," Oh, server wait."
10526500,10528580," Server queue."
10528580,10532820," Look at that."
10532820,10533940," That's really strange."
10533940,10534180," Okay."
10534180,10535140," You start in the server."
10535140,10538740," Then you server wait on a particular key."
10538740,10541380," What is that supposed to mean?"
10541380,10542340," On a particular key."
10542340,10545540," So, you can press a key and that will stop the server."
10545540,10548660," That's very interesting."
10548660,10549060," All right."
10549060,10552020," So, AWS server ADS."
10552020,10552500," Right."
10552500,10553860," So, server ADS."
10553860,10555780," And the function is wait."
10555780,10557060," Or procedure rather."
10557060,10558420," Procedure wait."
10558420,10560100," Here's the procedure wait."
10561140,10562820," mode termination."
10562820,10564740," No server."
10564740,10567700," The purpose of this procedure is to control the main procedure termination."
10567700,10570820," The procedure will return only when no server are running."
10570820,10573860," Or the queue key has been pressed."
10573860,10580500," If the mode is set to forever, wait will never return and the process will have to be killed."
10581460,10581940," Okay."
10581940,10584100," This is actually a pretty reasonable solution, in my opinion."
10584100,10585620," Yeah."
10585620,10588580," You just do instead of this shit."
10588580,10592740," AWS server wait."
10592740,10596260," And then we just use a server queue key pressed."
10596260,10597060," I think it's reasonable."
10597060,10601140," AWS server queue key pressed."
10602420,10603940," Can you customize that, I wonder?"
10603940,10605860," I wonder if you can customize that."
10605860,10607380," All right."
10607380,10609780," So, and I will stop."
10609780,10616100," If you press queue."
10616100,10618020," Okay."
10618020,10619300," And I'm going to remove these things."
10619300,10622420," Call me on port blah, blah, blah."
10622420,10623860," And it will stop if you press queue."
10623860,10624100," Cool."
10625220,10626180," Let's rebuild all that."
10626180,10631460," Now, if I do curl."
10631460,10635300," HTTP localhost 8080."
10635300,10636500," It returns hello world."
10636500,10639700," And I can even go here."
10639700,10641460," It's still hello world."
10641460,10643220," And can I press queue now?"
10643220,10645940," Okay."
10645940,10646980," It worked."
10646980,10648340," I think it worked."
10648340,10649380," One more time."
10649380,10650100," Oh, okay."
10650100,10652500," So, yeah."
10652500,10654580," That's a reasonable solution."
10654580,10657220," So, we just wait until you press queue."
10657220,10657940," And then it exits."
10657940,10663060," All right."
10663060,10669380," So, and let me try to do this kind of thing."
10669380,10670020," Let me take a look."
10670020,10670580," Who are you?"
10670580,10673300," Literally first message."
10673300,10677300," First message on the stream is end F, right?"
10677300,10678900," Let me see."
10678900,10683620," Okay."
10684260,10686420," So, you were actually chatting before."
10686420,10688100," If you had no messages before."
10688100,10689620," You would get instantly timed out."
10689620,10690100," Seriously."
10690100,10692020," All right."
10692020,10698100," So, let's actually do a committee committee."
10702740,10703380," And here."
10703380,10714500," So, it's going to be something like, you know, I'm going to do it like this."
10714500,10716100," I explore."
10716100,10724500," Because basically, I want to indicate that you need to use a browser to open the link, right?"
10724500,10729460," And I never know what browser to put there."
10729460,10732260," Like, if you put Chrome, you will upset Firefox users."
10732260,10734100," And if you put Firefox, you upset Chrome."
10734100,10735700," And this is such a, like a holy war."
10735700,10737460," So, let's use Internet Explorer.exe."
10737460,10738580," I think it's a pretty reason."
10740180,10741940," It's a pretty reasonable solution here."
10741940,10744020," All right."
10744020,10748260," All righty."
10748260,10749220," Let's let it look cool."
10749220,10753940," Get status."
10753940,10756660," Get add with me."
10756660,10760820," Server GPR."
10760820,10761220," Okay."
10761220,10761700," Server."
10761700,10763060," And this is so."
10763060,10764420," Get status."
10764420,10767540," Clean."
10767540,10770340," Clean up the server."
10771060,10771620," Example."
10771620,10773380," So, basically, what I was doing."
10773380,10774740," I was just cleaning up the examples."
10774740,10777300," In case you want to play with them for some reason."
10777300,10778820," They are pretty dumb examples, to be fair."
10778820,10780580," But you can find all of them here, right?"
10780580,10782660," So, here's the project."
10782660,10784180," So, we have like a client."
10784180,10787140," We tested the client functionality of AWS."
10787140,10790660," And we tested server functionality of AWS."
10790660,10795060," So, I slept through your stream."
10795060,10796020," So, I do my apologies."
10796020,10796980," Don't worry about it."
10796980,10800500," Imagine me actually sleeping through my streams."
10801060,10802820," So, all right."
10802820,10803540," Next step."
10803540,10804980," Next step."
10804980,10812020," I want you to test the SSL socket abilities of the project."
10812020,10813780," The SSL socket abilities of the project."
10813780,10816020," But before we're going to do that, I want to make a cup of tea."
10816020,10817460," Oh."
10817460,10819460," And I also need to make a small break, by the way."
10819460,10822420," I also need to make a small break."
10822420,10829220," I think first I'm going to actually fill up my stuff."
10832020,10832820," Just like Dennis."
10832820,10835620," Yeah, Dennis likes to sleep through these streams."
10835620,10836180," That's for sure."
10836180,10845140," Does anyone have any questions so far maybe about what we're doing?"
10846580,10848980," Right now we're just playing with Aiden."
10848980,10851300," I don't have any particular goal in mind."
10851300,10854180," But I kind of want to write like a simple IRC boat."
10854180,10858660," And I'm just looking through the libraries that will enable me with doing that."
10859380,10862340," So, so far we found like one IRC library."
10862340,10868500," Both, yes."
10868500,10870260," Yeah, IRC boat."
10870260,10878740," One IRC library, but this doesn't support any TLS connection."
10879380,10884820," So, but at the same time we have TLS sockets implemented in AWSL."
10884820,10886580," LWS."
10886580,10889620," In AWS."
10889620,10897060," So what I'm thinking is that can we actually reuse the SSL socket from AWS in the IRC library"
10897060,10897780," that we found?"
10897780,10898580," That would be interesting."
10898580,10901860," So, yeah."
10901860,10905620," And before we do that, we need to make a small..."
10906260,10908100," This is not what I wanted."
10908100,10908980," A small break."
10908980,10917780," Telegram boat when..."
10917780,10921380," When I started using it, I actually stopped using Telegram a long time ago."
10921380,10923700," I don't know why."
10923700,10926100," To be fair."
10926100,10929460," Oh, I know why."
10929460,10931060," Because my mobile phone is shit."
10931060,10932900," Okay, so I just need to buy a new cell phone."
10932900,10935860," And maybe I'll get back to Telegram at some point."
10937220,10937460," Yeah."
10937460,10940580," I just remembered why I don't use it."
10940580,10944500," Subgroup on Telegram."
10944500,10944900," Yeah."
10944900,10946980," Okay, good."
10946980,10957780," So let's make a small break and you guys have fun."
10966260,10996240," Thank you."
10996260,11026240," Thank you."
11026260,11056240," Thank you."
11056260,11086240," Thank you."
11086260,11116240," Thank you."
11116260,11146240," Thank you."
11146260,11150320," So, RSC bot, this is not what I..."
11150320,11150800," Oh, God."
11150800,11156840," I guess, like, playing around with Windows actually screwed up a lot of stuff here."
11156840,11158480," Welcome, welcome back."
11158960,11160020," What is a Pine phone?"
11160020,11169740," I'm not a huge phone person, so I don't really know what's, you know, popular these days among kids."
11171400,11177860," Smartphone developed by a computer manufacturer Pine 69 intended for allowing the user to have full control over the device."
11177860,11180340," Oh, freedom."
11180340,11182100," Oh, freedom, freedom."
11183720,11184300," Okay."
11213720,11214720," So, yeah."
11214720,11214720," So, yeah."
11214720,11214720," So, yeah."
11214720,11214720," So, yeah."
11214720,11214720," So, yeah."
11214720,11214720," So, yeah."
11214720,11214720," So, yeah."
11214720,11214720," So, yeah."
11214720,11217100," It's kind of weird."
11217100,11219780," All right."
11219780,11227200," So, let's copy server to, let's call it free node GPR."
11227200,11239440," So, and in here is going to be SRC, the build language is that, and this is going to be a free node ADB."
11239440,11241460," Free node ADB."
11241460,11242040," Cool."
11242040,11247440," So, let's go to SRC, free node ADB."
11247440,11250680," It does?"
11250680,11253380," Oh, so the time, the time has come to buy it."
11253380,11258900," Pro, uh, procedure, uh, what is it called?"
11258900,11263140," Free node is begin end."
11263140,11265160," Cool."
11265160,11271380," With ADA, text IO, use ADA."
11272040,11280580," Okay, boot line, uh, hello, free node."
11280580,11281580," Cool."
11281580,11291960," And now, if I try to build something here, GPR, build P, free node, GPR, it, uh, does not match"
11291960,11292960," the project."
11292960,11293960," Uh-huh."
11293960,11298520," I already fucked it up, so it's supposed to be free node, GPR."
11298520,11299520," Oh, yeah."
11299520,11300520," Yeah."
11300520,11302020," So, it has to be like this."
11302020,11307560," To be fair, ADA requires you to, like, duplicate the names of things too much, in my opinion."
11307560,11311560," Right, so we have to duplicate it here and here and there, and they have to match the files."
11311560,11319300," It's a little bit bureaucratic, but I mean maybe it's just like a side effect of this being"
11319300,11321100," developed for, like, government entities."
11321100,11323100," So, maybe they like this kind of stuff."
11323100,11323640," This kind of stuff."
11323640,11332640," So, we have a fetish for bureaucracy, uh, which does make sense, I mean, it's understandable."
11332640,11333640," All right."
11333640,11335640," And then, if I do this, uh, there we go."
11335640,11336640," Hello, free node."
11336640,11337640," So, we added another example here."
11337640,11338640," Another example."
11338640,11341180," Um, so, and we can also document it right away in the README."
11341180,11343180," So, this is going to be like this."
11343180,11347180," GPR build, uh, free node GPR."
11347180,11355720," And, just run build, oh, by the way, I actually fucked up, so it has to be like, build server."
11355720,11356720," Uh, right."
11356720,11364120," So, build server and then this thing, um, server and this is going to be just a free node."
11364120,11369180," Okay, uh, my water is ready, so I'm going to quickly go to the kitchen and pour myself some"
11369180,11370180," hot water."
11370180,11375660," So, don't go anywhere or I'm going to connect to your server over to your OS."
11394120,11400160," Well, at least it's going to be a secure connection, all right?"
11400160,11402580," So, it's good."
11402580,11405580," Secure connection is better than the secure one."
11405580,11410180," Um, um, all right."
11410180,11418180," Uh, yes, Internet Explorer is actually, it's executable is iExplorer.exe."
11418180,11423940," Uh, yeah, at least it was when I was a kid."
11423940,11426920," But, because I don't use Windows on a daily basis, I don't remember what it's called these"
11426920,11427920," days."
11427920,11443860," Uh, without, oh, explore, excuse me, I see, thank you, uh, iExplorer, all right, um, okay, so"
11443860,11453760," let's go, let's-a-go, ooh, that's not the modern line, that's for sure, um, let me see."
11453760,11456740," So, here is the TLS bullshit."
11456740,11460720," So, we definitely need to import AWS.net SSL."
11460720,11461720," Yeah, here's the package."
11461720,11464700," Yeah, here's the package."
11464700,11465700," AWS.net SSL."
11465700,11470680," Uh, with, uh, with, um, it's a mini word."
11470680,11475680," I don't even know how to pronounce that."
11475680,11481680," Um, uh, .net, .net."
11481680,11493500," Hmm, is it possible to just use AWS, like this, and refer to all of these functions as"
11493500,11494660," just net SSL."
11494660,11498640," That would be actually kind of cool, but I'm not sure if it's gonna work."
11498640,11502620," So, let's do gpr, build, and see if it's gonna complain."
11502620,11505620," It doesn't really complain, so, which is nice."
11505620,11509620," So, okay, uh, how can we do all of that?"
11509620,11514620," So, we have a connect, uh, but to connect to a socket, you have to create a socket."
11514620,11516620," You have to think like a socket, right?"
11516620,11521620," Uh, so, socket, host, port, wait."
11521620,11522620," All right, socket type."
11522620,11523620," Uh, what kind of socket types can you have?"
11523620,11524620," Socket type is this thing."
11524620,11525620," Uh, return, socket type."
11525620,11531620," To be fair, like, this syntax is kind of verbose, but at the same time, it's very grep-friendly."
11531620,11534620," So, you have to create a socket, you have to think like a socket, right?"
11534620,11537620," Uh, so, socket, host, port, wait."
11537620,11538620," All right, socket type."
11538620,11539620," Uh, what kind of socket types can you have?"
11539620,11540620," So, socket type is this thing."
11540620,11541620," Uh, return, socket type."
11541620,11542620," Uh, return, socket type."
11542620,11543620," To be fair, like, this syntax is kind of verbose, but at the same time, it's very grep-friendly."
11544620,11545620," Believe it or not."
11545620,11548620," Like, I want to find something that returns a socket type."
11548620,11555620," I just grep or search for things that return a socket type and I quite often find it."
11555620,11562620," So, and then I can want to find the function, uh, function that, uh, starts with secure."
11562620,11564620," And I instantly find it."
11564620,11567620," And I know that it's a function definition and not anything else."
11567620,11573620," And if it's, um, you know, um, I want to find something that doesn't return any value,"
11573620,11576620," I can do procedure set and I find the procedure."
11576620,11582620," So it's like these extra keywords kind of makes it easy to search for things within the source code."
11582620,11584620," Like, I don't know how to explain."
11584620,11591620," Maybe it's basically boomer with within me who like says that, but it kind of makes it a little bit easier."
11591620,11592620," Right."
11592620,11594620," And, uh, like I need to get socket type somewhere."
11594620,11597620," I literally, this is literally what it is."
11597620,11598620," Return socket type."
11598620,11599620," What returns the socket type?"
11599620,11600620," Okay."
11600620,11606620," So, um, secure client, uh, config and so on and so forth."
11606620,11609620," So make client side SSL connection from plain socket."
11609620,11611620," Uh, that's actually a pretty cool one."
11611620,11616620," Uh, secure server, uh, secure client."
11616620,11621620," Make client side, uh, SSL connection from plain socket."
11621620,11623620," Uh, it does require plain socket."
11623620,11627620," So where, oh, you need to have a plain socket."
11627620,11634620," SSL would be made automatically on the first read or explicitly by do handshake."
11635620,11636620," Uh, interesting."
11636620,11640620," Do not free or close a secure circuit after this call host parameter."
11640620,11643620," It's a host name, uh, connection server is defined."
11643620,11644620," Mm-hmm."
11644620,11645620," Very interesting."
11645620,11648620," Very, very interesting."
11648620,11651620," But it feels like it was a little bit easier."
11651620,11652620," I think."
11652620,11658620," Um, create."
11658620,11661620," Maybe there's a function."
11661620,11662620," Create."
11662620,11664620," Function connect."
11664620,11665620," Uh-huh."
11665620,11666620," Um."
11666620,11667620," Okay."
11667620,11668620," Um."
11668620,11670620," I, I forgot what was that function though."
11670620,11671620," Accept circuit."
11671620,11672620," It's over, uh, connect."
11672620,11673620," All right."
11673620,11674620," Oh, okay."
11674620,11675620," This one is interesting."
11675620,11676620," It's a interface."
11676620,11677620," Okay."
11677620,11678620," I forgot what was that function though."
11678620,11679620," Accept circuit."
11679620,11680620," It's over, uh, connect."
11680620,11681620," Okay."
11681620,11682620," Um."
11682620,11683620," I forgot what was that function though."
11683620,11684620," Accept circuit."
11684620,11685620," It's over, uh, connect."
11685620,11686620," Okay."
11686620,11687620," Um."
11687620,11688620," I forgot what was that function though."
11688620,11689620," Accept circuit."
11689620,11690620," It's over, uh, connect."
11690620,11691620," All right."
11691620,11692620," Oh, okay."
11692620,11693620," This one is interesting."
11693620,11694620," It's an in and out."
11694620,11696620," So it modifies the socket."
11696620,11698620," So maybe this is what I can use here."
11698620,11700620," Connect circuit on a given host port."
11700620,11701620," Uh."
11701620,11702620," All right."
11702620,11703620," But how can I create a socket?"
11703620,11704620," I still understand."
11704620,11709620," Do I really have to, have to use that?"
11709620,11716620," Secure circuit to just create the circuit."
11716620,11723620," So first it feels like there is no other way, but you have to, um, first create a regular"
11723620,11724620," circuit."
11724620,11727620," Like there's no other way to do that."
11727620,11728620," All right."
11728620,11730620," So let's actually start with plain sockets then."
11730620,11734620," And I think, uh, AWS has its own library for sockets."
11734620,11736620," It doesn't use Gnat sockets probably."
11736620,11740620," Uh, so let's actually separate everything and open aws.net."
11740620,11743620," And I think this is where you do that."
11743620,11744620," All right."
11744620,11748620," And, uh, you just have a socket type in here."
11748620,11749620," Uh, yep."
11749620,11751620," And how do you create a socket?"
11751620,11754620," So what does return a socket type?"
11754620,11770900," a socket type what is a return socket uh there we go security boolean interesting uh security"
11770900,11788600," boolean um false yeah exactly uh huh okay um let's take a look at the implementation of this function"
11788600,11794980," this is a really interesting function what the fuck uh adb and the the comment doesn't really"
11794980,11803780," explain much so function uh socket is function security okay so"
11803780,11812440," huh ssl socket type do do you really okay"
11812440,11824700," and it does import ssl so uh ssl okay so i thought all right all right so i thought"
11824700,11831140," the relationship is i thought the relationship is uh you have aws.net which is just a regular"
11831140,11838060," plain socket right um aws net which is regular plain circuits"
11838060,11848940," plain circuits and on top of it they have implemented aws net ssl right right this is what i thought"
11848940,11857140," it is but it's actually the other way around this is an abstraction over plain socket and ssl"
11857140,11863940," socket this is an interface interface and this is just an implementation like a specific implementation"
11863940,11871200," sort of like not strictly speaking right not strictly speaking so and that's why the uh the thing that i"
11871200,11876480," need to use is probably aws.net and when i create a socket i just need to create it as a secure socket"
11876480,11888420," and that will probably just work um probably right and here do we have a function uh connect right if i want to connect or just connect uh"
11888420,11902320," that's really strange oh it's it's adb i probably need to take a look at the um at the signatures i think signatures are a little bit more useful in this particular case"
11902320,11914260," connect uh accept so yeah you can connect to it all right okay so that's that's pretty straightforward i'm not gonna lie you create the uh"
11914260,11918360," the socket and you just connect to the socket it's just pretty straightforward let's fucking do that wait"
11918360,11927260," all right okay so this is gonna be just that and just use aws net and the first thing i want to do i want to just create a socket"
11927260,11939200," uh better than c already well i mean we haven't tried it yet maybe like at least so far from the signatures of the functions what i see is pretty simple"
11939200,11958640," um so i need to pour a cup actually i oversteep this tea so i wonder if i'll be able to sleep"
11958640,11963440," probably not as usual"
11963440,11967940," who needs sleep anyway"
11967940,11972200," so here's the connect"
11972200,11976160," socket connect i'm sorry"
11976160,11979060," um if i'm creating the"
11979060,11984120," client yeah yeah if i'm creating the client i don't need to bind it because it's for the service"
11984120,11987960," um so it's going to be net socket"
11987960,11992100," uh and security is going to be true there we go"
11992100,11995740," um i suppose i want to initialize it somewhere here"
11995740,12001440," uh hi chat is ada regularly used today"
12001440,12004960," well so far throughout today's stream"
12004960,12007580," the ada was used pretty regularly"
12007580,12009300," i used every"
12009300,12010960," minute of the stream"
12010960,12011860," ada"
12011860,12015060," ada was used for every minute of the stream so i think it's pretty regular"
12015060,12016260," um"
12016260,12017940," okay"
12017940,12019080," so"
12019080,12021000," we have a type class"
12021000,12022200," um"
12022200,12038240," we have a type class"
12038240,12039220," uh type class"
12039220,12039840," no"
12039840,12040700," oh"
12040700,12041440," type"
12041440,12043060," class"
12043060,12044900," type class"
12044900,12048360," ada has type classes"
12048360,12049540," nice"
12049540,12051280," who would have thought"
12051280,12052640," um"
12052640,12059320," so we're gonna have a socket"
12059320,12062240," uh we're gonna have a socket"
12062240,12065380," and this one is gonna be net socket type"
12065380,12067800," and i'm not sure if i have to do a class here"
12067800,12072140," uh but since this thing returns a class maybe this is what i have to do here"
12072140,12073660," um"
12073660,12078360," and maybe this is the famous uh the famous op of ada"
12078360,12079680," uh"
12079680,12080860," net socket"
12080860,12082280," true"
12082280,12088300," uh okay so we created the socket and the next thing i want to do i want to connect"
12088300,12090020," socket connect"
12090020,12094920," okay so this is gonna be net connect"
12094920,12097900," connect connect"
12097900,12099440," socket"
12099440,12102480," uh host what's gonna be the host"
12102480,12106580," so the host is gonna be the free node one"
12106580,12109160," uh free node connect"
12109160,12117060," chat"
12117060,12117060," chat"
12117060,12118180," free node"
12118180,12119060," um"
12119060,12121020," maybe i'm gonna actually make this a constant"
12121020,12122680," so this is gonna be a host"
12122680,12123860," constant"
12123860,12124880," string"
12124880,12126020," and"
12126020,12127880," this is the free node"
12127880,12128760," uh"
12128760,12130900," then we're also gonna have a port"
12130900,12132400," and it's also gonna be a constant"
12132400,12133160," uh"
12133160,12134640," but it's gonna be a positive number"
12134640,12137940," as far as i know positive is a type in ada"
12137940,12138900," uh"
12138900,12141980," and it's a more general type than integers"
12141980,12146340," or maybe it's actually less general type because integers is also negative"
12146340,12149740," so positive is a very specific range of integers"
12149740,12151520," which is kind of cool"
12151520,12153980," so instead of unsigned they have positive"
12153980,12155820," oh my god this is actually very cool"
12155820,12157940," instead of unsigned"
12157940,12159260," it's positive"
12159260,12161100," this is so nice"
12161100,12161880," like it's so"
12161880,12163740," it just makes sense i think"
12163740,12164920," um"
12164920,12165540," all right"
12165540,12167180," for uh"
12167180,12167780," for tls"
12167780,12169800," for tls we have to use 6697"
12169800,12171060," 6697"
12171060,12172740," there we go"
12172740,12174640," um"
12174640,12175580," all right"
12175580,12177020," so here we have a socket"
12177020,12178240," then we connect"
12178240,12180360," and then we use the host"
12180360,12181800," uh"
12181800,12183160," maybe we also have to"
12183160,12185920," okay so these are mandatory things"
12185920,12186840," these are mandatory"
12186840,12188160," um"
12188160,12191860," why not 6969"
12191860,12192300," uh"
12192300,12194640," you need to ask free node developers"
12194640,12196460," why they didn't use 6969"
12196460,12198320," if they used i would love to use it as well"
12198320,12198660," so"
12198660,12200320," i don't know"
12200320,12201400," i don't know"
12201400,12203880," okay so we specified socket host and port"
12203880,12205180," um"
12205180,12207020," and do we need to wait"
12207020,12208360," they actually talked about wait"
12208360,12210460," connect the socket on a given host port"
12210460,12214480," if wait is true connect will wait for the connection to be established"
12214480,12217700," for the timeout second specified by the set timeout"
12217700,12219100," uh routine"
12219100,12221160," if wait is false connect will return immediately"
12221160,12222200," not for waiting for"
12222200,12223900," we're not waiting for the connection to be established"
12223900,12227340," it is possible to wait for the connection completion by current wait routine"
12227340,12230760," uh with output set to true or event blah blah blah"
12230760,12231800," okay i get it"
12231800,12234760," uh so this is how we shut down the connection"
12234760,12239720," shut down the read or write or both side of the socket"
12239720,12250540," if how if how is both close it does not rise a socket error if the socket is not connected or already shut down"
12250540,12253320," and also release any memory associated with the socket"
12253320,12254460," huh interesting"
12254460,12264120," that's actually pretty cool so we have to shut it down to make sure that like any read write is stopped"
12264120,12268600," and then you can uh free the memory so these are like two separate steps"
12268600,12271440," okay uh we're gonna roll with it then"
12271440,12275840," net shut down uh shut down for the socket"
12275840,12279440," right and then we're gonna have net free uh socket as well"
12279440,12284000," cool um do we have anything okay here is i o"
12284000,12287700," so we can have send and we can have receive"
12287700,12294760," so this thing accepts the socket uh and the data oh my god it's just it's so nice"
12294760,12298880," like it's like you look at the signatures of the functions and they are like documentation"
12298880,12301320," when you read them as documentation this is so nice"
12301320,12308280," uh okay so we're probably gonna use this one"
12308280,12313920," thank you"
12313920,12321060," have you been on the um on the introvert uh party when we were creating them"
12321060,12324720," yeah i think they're pretty cool they turn out pretty cool"
12324720,12327340," um choose"
12327340,12337720," uh no oh okay it's okay it wasn't that interesting anyway so"
12337720,12344460," so this is probably what we want to do here we want to receive some data and"
12344460,12352760," uh yeah do something like it so here we're connecting uh to the stuff and let's declare"
12352760,12356140," some sort of a chunk right some sort of a chunk"
12356140,12359200," it's going to begin and end"
12359200,12379420," it's really interesting it's kind of funny like in ada you can define variables pretty much anywhere in the body of the function but you are required to create a new scope for that"
12379420,12387800," right right so declare uh declare block in ada is kind of similar to uh a new scope blocks in c"
12387800,12390160," right so in c"
12390160,12399900," okay okay there we go in c it's going to be like that so uh you can create this kind of blocks"
12399900,12418820," right right so this is the declare block this is what it means and what's funny that every time you want to define a variable like in arbitrary place in uh in the body you have to do that within the new scope like every time you want to define a variable it has to be at the beginning of the new scope and this is what enables you with defining new variables"
12418820,12423000," defining new variables it's kind of it's kind of interesting how it forces you to do that"
12423000,12430160," can you do socket shut down instead of net socket shut probably i don't know uh i don't know if this will compile"
12430160,12433480," uh let's first try to compile this thing"
12433480,12440180," so let's define a chunk and the chunk has to be stream element count and i would assume that stream element"
12440180,12446960," uh stream element array is a part of the net net stream element array"
12446960,12454680," and let's actually do it like this it's going to be net receive net receive this is how you do that"
12454680,12457880," um net receive"
12457880,12463100," and we are providing this socket that we just created"
12463100,12468600," uh and we don't have to provide the max because it has a default parameter so we just receive"
12468600,12476320," uh a chunk of the size of four kilobytes right this is what we're trying to reach receive and um i don't know it"
12476320,12481520," would be nice to print the chunk but i have no idea how to print it so let's actually call something uh receive"
12481520,12489240," the chunk you receive the chunk cool so now i want to try to just build it and see where it's"
12489240,12494120," going to fail okay it fails it in here and this is because i forgot the semicolon of course"
12494120,12508680," uh stream um element array is not declared in net uh pretty expected uh stream element uh all right so we don't know where it's defined it's probably defined in one of those"
12508680,12523440," uh uh aida streams oh that is very interesting aida streams so it's a part of the standard library i presume"
12523440,12536560," so that means maybe we can do the following thing with ada streams uh use ada streams"
12536560,12547200," and uh in here i would be able to do the following thing will that compile now it does compile okay cool um"
12552640,12557440," i really like how it easy to just explore ada without reading any stupid documentation"
12557440,12563200," do you like ada well i like the fact that i can explore it uh and i'm not forced to read anything"
12563200,12569840," that's what i like so far the the syntax is a little bit boomerish"
12569840,12574160," but it's kind of convenient in some particular situations"
12574160,12579920," by the way the master leech are you working for us military and you're trying to recruit me"
12582640,12584720," i'm just joking uh all right"
12584720,12594480," okay this entire stuff compiles uh can we now try to connect to free node"
12594480,12598720," uh i hate either it's the worst language"
12602240,12606880," yes yes i i forgot i forgot that i hate it um all right so free node"
12606880,12615440," okay wow"
12615440,12619840," at least that is something"
12624320,12624720," poke"
12624720,12642320," so i'm just thinking how i'm gonna approach that uh this uh this problem"
12642320,12648800," i see two ways i have fun yeah i already i can already see from the name of the exception that"
12648800,12652400," is gonna be a lot of fun uh yes"
12652400,12655360," classic"
12655360,12661760," uh okay so it's actually producing idea uh cert pam"
12661760,12667280," uh actually once it's like that so what's gonna happen if you just like literally have the requested"
12667280,12674160," data will not available okay at least it is actually looking for this in the current folder"
12674160,12679920," at least this is what we know about it so this is actually kind of cool right so uh and then we if"
12679920,12688320," we remove this thing uh yeah it literally looks for it in in the current folder um all right"
12688320,12695120," open sss certificates uh where are they located though where are they usually located they're usually"
12695120,12705360," located somewhere in like a system or something uh something like etc certificate oh probably open ssl"
12705360,12714320," uh open i forgot somewhere on your system i'm not sure where yeah exactly like i remember that"
12714320,12722000," it even has like a concatenation of all the like public keys um like specifically debian it has a"
12722000,12729600," concatenation of all the known public keys and there is a special scripts uh in debian that allows you to"
12729600,12734720," maintain this concatenation and this is the concatenation that is used by pretty much everything in your"
12734720,12747120," system but i forgot the specific of this situation so uh all right um etc ssl certs yeah certs java"
12750560,12758880," okay yeah here they are uh does it have any pam files though crap yeah it does have pam files though"
12758880,12761520," this is like all of them are pam files um"
12761520,12771280," and i hope it doesn't expose anything important so i'm not going to actually do that um it probably"
12771280,12779200," doesn't but whatever okay so let's do the first attempt let's do the first attempt it's going to be uh"
12779760,12784640," free node and i'm going to literally just copy paste this entire thing because i'm pretty sure if"
12784640,12789520," like aws probably used quite a lot um"
12789520,12795600," find cert m okay error thrown when object"
12795600,12804480," uh all right results for this thing specifically thrown wrong exception when opening an existing file"
12806240,12812240," apache error okay it looks like google is not gonna help us much"
12812240,12819520," um but there is another thing we can try cert"
12819520,12824480," no results found yeah it's a good sign it's already a good sign"
12826880,12833440," uh it's already a good sign okay issues uh for issues related to lvs client proxy support"
12833440,12836800," and also there's a code"
12841440,12844800," ssl initialize yeah it's already like looking for this"
12844800,12851680," it's looking for cert them"
12851680,12861680," to be fair if you think about it"
12863280,12866720," http as example worked perfectly right"
12866720,12877200," https example worked perfectly and it didn't require any cert pam right and probably use this ssl"
12877200,12886640," sockets maybe it used them in a way where it was just not important or something i suppose it's really"
12886640,12894160," really strange um ssl circuit type so wishes related uh proxy"
12894160,12896960," uh-huh"
12896960,12900640," maybe try copying"
12900640,12903360," maybe"
12903360,12910320," that's a good idea probably but i want to understand the root cause of this thing"
12910960,12915920," the root cause of this is it there it's it's not even available there i don't even have such a file"
12915920,12920320," such file here uh maybe i have it in another place um"
12920320,12924560," certs cert"
12926320,12940240," is it something like is it c c uh ca certificates it's there on my system oh well you're using arch"
12940240,12945040," so um i don't know what you're using to if i think you're using arch so probably probably it's probably"
12945040,12951840," organized differently um okay debian cert pam"
12954400,12956400," self-sign certificates um"
12956400,12963520," local certs"
12963520,12971840," second creating certificate and then open ssl"
12979360,12983600," you know what uh i just want to go into the source code for this thing"
12983600,12991440," and just explore it uh myself grab rn uh cert pam i just want to see who uses that and where"
12991440,12995040," uh okay so"
12995040,12997840," aws default"
12997840,13000400," aha aha"
13002080,13004080," aws default"
13004080,13006960," cert pam"
13006960,13015920," okay security certificate it's looking for the certificate here who's using certificate so"
13015920,13018080," that's kind of important um"
13018080,13022640," grab certificate"
13022640,13027120," uh this is not how we do that uh it has to be recursive"
13028560,13030480," um config set"
13030480,13033040," uh"
13033040,13035040," set default"
13035040,13040640," probably i should do that slightly different so so i'm in here"
13040640,13042880," and certificate"
13042880,13047600," file name okay so you initialize exchange certificate"
13047600,13048400," aha"
13050080,13054640," and you can also set whether you want to initialize the ssl layer info config certificate"
13054640,13059120," must point to a valid certificate security mode can be used to change the method"
13059120,13064480," it's true the client will send a certificate to the server if false on the server will send its"
13064480,13071920," certificate i think we need to set this thing to false or maybe somebody sets it to true for some reason"
13072640,13074480," uh uh certificate"
13074480,13090800," okay that's kind of uh aws net adb certificate and there's no mentioning of certificate anyway"
13094000,13101680," that's really really strange like how does it reach it then so here's the ssl"
13101680,13108000," uh and that's the only okay when we're creating a socket and when i'm connecting the socket right when"
13108000,13111520," i'm connecting the circuit uh connect"
13113040,13118160," i need a function it doesn't have a function connect"
13118160,13129120," uh already have it uh yeah yeah it's just i'm testing a different thing"
13129280,13137760," uh uh function connect"
13137760,13145760," it's not in ws i'm in ads right where's the connector"
13145760,13158000," oh it's procedure connect holy shit i'm an idiot okay so uh it's an abstract and in aws net adb"
13159280,13164080," procedure connect does it have procedure connect yeah that's what's interesting that's what's"
13164080,13172320," interesting it has procedure connect in ads but it doesn't have it in adb this is what actually"
13172320,13179920," like really weird about it so that means there is a probably way it's it's probably using connect"
13179920,13188000," from the ssl yeah that's really interesting so is it a function connect yeah yeah so i want to double"
13188000,13192960," check that this is why i'm still uh ratholing on the aws.net and not moving there because i"
13192960,13199760," like it looks weird and i won't try to explore that uh procedure connect yeah you have that"
13199760,13210080," all right and in aws do you have procedure connect you do have a procedure connect and it's pretty much"
13210080,13224480," the same right so and uh let me see uh aws.net ssl.adb what did i it doesn't exist don't tell me it doesn't"
13224480,13238160," exist uh aws.net all right the vim is so bad at auto completion holy it's bad out of the completion uh"
13238160,13239120," it doesn't have adb"
13239120,13247920," it doesn't have adb like but it only has ads how does that make any sense"
13249760,13262400," uh procedure connect oh okay"
13262400,13275760," circuit constructor i feel like uh exchange procedure initialize"
13278480,13285920," okay so we have procedure initialize and you get the config initialize the ssl layer into config"
13285920,13291200," certificate maybe this is what we need to call first right maybe this is what we need to call first"
13293200,13305120," uh certificate certificate certificate must and it doesn't return anything"
13305120,13308000," all right"
13308000,13312800," you can also use a new config here"
13314160,13324160," uh so the only thing probably i'm gonna set there so it automatically exchange all right it feels like"
13324160,13341200," maybe that's what i need to do so this is gonna be like this with aws net ssl uh use aws net uh right so"
13341200,13351840," uh i want to use like ssl only ssl uh all right this is ssl thingy package right this is a package"
13351840,13354720," uh it's a package"
13354720,13368960," initialize uh and initialize uh config so it's going to be ssl null config we're going to use no config it's"
13368960,13376720," actually quite handy that it's available there null config um certificate file name"
13376720,13382240," you have to provide it you have to provide it"
13382240,13388240," we probably can use the defaults but i forgot where they're located so um"
13390240,13392560," with aws defaults"
13392560,13400720," the native files are in ssl open ssl adb there is implementation for different ssl dibs"
13400720,13403840," ah that makes sense thank you um"
13403840,13407760," what i was doing"
13407760,13410480," what i was doing"
13413280,13419440," oh yeah okay so it's certificate file exchange certificate i wonder if i uh say don't exchange"
13419440,13421920," certificate do i need to provide certificate file"
13424240,13430160," uh yeah defaults uh all right"
13430160,13443840," copy your xxx which one what does it mean i have a lot of things there um i have a lot of things there"
13443840,13445760," and is the uh thing"
13445760,13455440," why oh my god i i lost the trail of thoughts i like i have the trail specific trail of thoughts and chat is"
13455440,13462960," debating me into it's a ca certificates it's probably not gonna work if it's not gonna work you're banned"
13462960,13469360," straight up okay not banned but timed out for at least an hour um okay"
13469360,13484720," copy uh etc ssl certs ca certificates uh cert pam right so uh we're gonna copy it here"
13484720,13490400," it's pretty it's pretty big cool um now"
13491680,13495920," so let's try to build this entire thing gpr build"
13495920,13504160," uh p free node gpr cool defaults not found"
13504160,13512240," ban incoming ban is incoming"
13512240,13521600," we're already trying it okay so let's make sure that i actually tested everything correctly"
13521600,13526720," right so uh the requested data was not available all right so as i promised timeout"
13526720,13530480," uh cypher rec one one hour there we go"
13530480,13537440," uh okay so let's remove that uh cert pim"
13542800,13551680," um now let me try to recover my trail of thoughts okay so uh all right so let's try to initialize"
13551680,13558640," everything here right uh so we need to do this thing with aws default"
13560160,13566240," uh i think it's just default right and uh i need to open it here but i don't want to open it anywhere"
13566240,13571040," uh aws um default"
13571040,13576000," uh certificate certificate"
13576000,13584800," uh tls ticket support oh it's just empty it's just literally empty i think"
13586080,13587680," what is the certificate file name"
13587680,13593360," okay so i'm gonna actually put an empty thing there sure"
13593360,13598080," ssl uh initialize initialize"
13600240,13611440," ssl uh certificate name is gonna be empty so and hopefully the exchange certificate falls will do"
13611440,13616320," its trick hopefully i'm not quite sure i'm not quite sure"
13618160,13626400," uh yep and let's just do gpr build is it gonna do anything config must be a variable"
13626400,13629280," huh"
13629280,13634320," okay so uh let's define it like that then"
13634320,13643520," oh and also look at that i create i create a socket after i do initialization so that means"
13643520,13650560," i have to do that in a declaration here all right i have to do that in the declaration uh all right so"
13650560,13658800," that makes sense to me at least uh makes sense to me makes sense to me uh so here's that and on top"
13658800,13666320," of that we may want to have a config uh we may want to have a config it has to be a variable ssl"
13666320,13687600," because it's gonna uh actually modify it right it's gonna actually do the thing is it gonna do the"
13687600,13709760," thing uh build frame okay file perm it still requires it okay so that means all right what is that another ban"
13709760,13739680," the real question is like why https works right so this is the real question right uh we have https"
13739680,13746480," request um in our client which definitely uses tls sockets"
13746480,13753920," but it doesn't have any problems"
13753920,13759760," uh to be honest you shouldn't have to click exactly that's what i'm talking about this is complete"
13759760,13768720," bullshit and again i'm repeating that we already used tls sockets in a form of https get request i'm repeating"
13768720,13772640," again again we already use them in a form of https request"
13772640,13775520," um"
13775520,13781760," um so let's actually do gpr build p wttr there we go"
13781760,13785760," um"
13785760,13791680," for those who are still suggesting just copy certificate just create certificate for all of you who's still"
13791680,13799680," suggesting this weird stuff we already used https sockets in the form of https request"
13799680,13803680," in the form of https request and i didn't have to do"
13803680,13812800," shit you see what i mean so we have these ssl sockets and we have abstraction over it in the same library"
13812800,13819040," and the abstraction is configuring it somehow so we don't have to do that like"
13819040,13828880," come on people come on holy shit all right so the question is what exactly is it doing then right"
13828880,13836000," so how does it configure it and what does it provide there and what else uh we need to understand that"
13837440,13838720," um okay"
13838720,13843840," so this is irc board this is that um"
13843840,13855120," so i'm still in here uh and what i'm using for uh for this thing i'm just using the client right so it's"
13855120,13863520," going to be aws uh aws client right client uh and i want to look into it so i'm going to look at the"
13863520,13871920," procedure uh actually function function get so what exactly is it doing so it creates an http connection"
13871920,13880480," all right uh persistent and uses a particular certificate and it uses default client certificate"
13880480,13886080," right it uses the default client certificate and i should have actually done that so if i separate"
13886080,13898560," this entire thing uh aws default right client certificate and it's empty it uses the default client certificate"
13899440,13902240," function function get okay"
13902240,13912160," should be connection create blah blah blah blah i think we need to go deeper into create the http"
13912160,13920480," connection the question is where it is located uh do we have aws http or something like that"
13920480,13928240," so where can we get the create who defines the create function uh okay here it is"
13929760,13937120," so uh certificate so here is the certificate uh return connection http and it redirects it to another"
13937120,13938880," create um"
13938880,13948400," okay okay so this is interesting so this is like the main create uh-huh"
13952880,13962400," so net ssl config you use net ssl config you use net ssl config all right um certificate bound proxy data"
13962400,13968000," connection authentication url security default ssl config"
13977360,13983840," trouser down thank you so much for tier one subscription your first subscription by the way and welcome"
13983840,13992880," okay so this is what it's doing it's uh trying to call this function um ssl initialize"
13994880,14002000," that we were trying to call as well but certificate right that it's use uses right certificate"
14002000,14004080," um"
14004080,14013200," pay meal 32 thank you thank you for for subscription to which prime subscription and welcome to our epic"
14013200,14020400," ada club welcome welcome welcome the certificate is just the default default client certificate which is"
14020400,14030400," um you know um nothing uh all right so this is a secure connection"
14030400,14038800," i guess that's what we need to do but we've already tried to do that but maybe"
14038800,14041600," uh i just didn't do that correctly um"
14043120,14052240," maybe i need to do a net ssl version 2.3 client i can try to do that um so let me let me try to do"
14052240,14052960," that one more time"
14052960,14066400," net ssl ssl version 2.3 client uh yeah i know that i probably shouldn't use this thing but uh i just i'm"
14066400,14070560," just trying to copy whatever is going on here uh because it works for them"
14073120,14082400," it might work if we change the default user agent to mozilla what default user agent are you talking"
14082400,14082720," about"
14082720,14092880," we're trying to establish connection to irc irc is not based or based on https what are you talking about"
14095920,14097520," all right all right so um"
14097520,14108080," okay let's try to rebuild that uh this is not what i was trying to rebuild uh what is exactly"
14108080,14120320," no we're one layer lower than http one layer lower user agent is defined there they're using is to"
14120880,14125520," bounded string that might be useful to note um"
14125520,14139760," i don't think so to bounded string basically converts one string type to another string type"
14139760,14142560," so i don't think it transforms the content of it so"
14144080,14153040," uh i but it may affect how functions are overloaded so that could be a thing uh but anyway"
14153040,14157920," still file certificate does not exist"
14164320,14178160," all right so uh let's try another thing uh io exception name uh file let's find grab rn does not exist"
14178160,14182720," let's try to find that"
14192720,14194480," so this is a parameter ideas"
14194480,14204240," all right ssl to this thing um"
14204240,14209840," file but it actually it's it's not printed like that"
14209840,14213280," so it could be somewhere else"
14216560,14221120," oh"
14221120,14223440," so"
14223440,14228000," by the way does it even affect anything if i"
14228000,14229200," try to do something like"
14229200,14231200," your mom"
14231200,14233920," cam is it gonna affect anything"
14233920,14235680," so that's a good question"
14235680,14238640," is it gonna affect anything"
14238640,14243280," oh it does affect something"
14243280,14248400," okay okay um"
14248400,14254960," all right all right this is something interesting so can i uh not exchange certificates now um"
14254960,14258480," x exchange certificate"
14258480,14264800," uh false maybe i have to explicitly say that i'm not sure if i have to do that"
14267360,14269200," um okay"
14269200,14275040," is there a specific reason for using other or is it just for fun"
14275040,14279200," yes there is specific reason is because it's really paid uh well"
14279200,14285840," so an average ada developer is paid way more than an average python or javascript developer"
14285840,14290960," so and i think everyone should jump on that ada train so that's the reason why i'm using because i love money"
14290960,14295120," uh all right so what else do we have here"
14301040,14302640," why does it work then"
14302640,14310400," is it something with the with the thing aws"
14310400,14316240," net ssl"
14320160,14335680," well good re exactly i'm telling you if it doesn't make you um rich it's not worth even doing that"
14335680,14338240," come on bro okay initialize"
14339120,14344000," uh certificate fail man"
14344000,14346960," exchange"
14346960,14356400," i can can i just set certificate not required like initialize the seller into config"
14356400,14362480," into the config certificate file uh okay i can initialize that into the config but now"
14363120,14369600," uh i have to use that config then at some point okay so that's probably what i need to do oh"
14369600,14374400," shit i think i know all right all right so um"
14374400,14387360," config how do i use it then so i just initialize it uh and"
14389360,14396080," support for server okay so initialize default config certificate file name"
14396080,14401520," release set config okay set the ssl configuration was you for the secure"
14401520,14409680," found it okay so cool cool cool cool cool cool cool now uh i probably don't even need any of this"
14409680,14417600," so you set that then you create a socket and then you need to set the config for that socket holy"
14417600,14426080," shit uh set uh set config because it just initializes that config all right so socket um"
14426080,14431040," and uh we're just gonna set it there there we go um"
14431040,14440080," that is very interesting okay um so is it gonna work now is it gonna work"
14442000,14448000," so i see that's what's gonna bring all of the money that's why i'm learning all of that i'm gonna be"
14448000,14454960," rich once we learn this language um set config is not declared in net oh because it's actually"
14454960,14457600," declared an ssl right ssl"
14457600,14465280," cool uh all right so i expected private type"
14466160,14470640," did they do a fucky wacky so first has to be the socket"
14470640,14481280," oh it has to be a socket type but we have a socket class"
14486160,14487840," i'm confused i'm confused okay"
14487840,14496160," all right so uh here's the connection and"
14496160,14505360," ssl config ssl config uh where do we use ssl config and how"
14507360,14512320," uh-huh all right so this is just a client ssl config"
14512320,14516640," and then you close"
14516640,14523520," and i'm going in circles okay"
14523520,14532080," um so you have to set the config for the socket but the problem is that we don't have a socket type"
14533280,14537520," we don't have a socket type we have a socket class and i don't really understand what's the difference"
14537520,14544080," between them then because you can create a new socket uh you you cannot do things like this like"
14544080,14546160," it's not going to work so that's the problem"
14546160,14553840," type of the object cannot be abstract maybe class white uh yeah"
14556560,14562080," um okay so maybe we should just look at some of the examples because it's really"
14562080,14567440," not clear how to use all of that i'm closing everything here everything everything go away"
14567440,14574080," go away too many too many tabs once it's actually so slow to close um"
14580080,14587280," uh the core aws rather core aws oh my god so slow"
14587280,14598160," do you have any tls or ssl examples it doesn't have anything cert"
14605360,14607840," certificate callbacks so adb"
14607840,14620480," so config object service start"
14620480,14630000," all right so it's a waste of time um the thing is"
14633040,14640000," maybe i need to create everything um so what returns uh socket type i think nothing returns a"
14640000,14645840," socket type in here i think nothing returns a secure client yeah"
14645840,14654160," make client side ssl connection from plain socket"
14654160,14661840," yes that's how probably holy this is how we have to do that apparently i think"
14663040,14668640," uh yeah i think that's how it has to be done unfortunately"
14668640,14675280," secure clients okay let's let's try it this way because this is originally how i want to do that"
14675280,14679920," and maybe because of that we don't even need to initialize anything because it's going to use ssl"
14679920,14688560," config anyway uh right it's going to use it anyway um all right so here's the config i'm going to remove all"
14688560,14696160," of that and then i create like a regular not secure uh but maybe i have to make it secure"
14696160,14704240," let's let's make it not secure oh by the way so if i make it not secure and just try to connect is"
14704240,14712800," it going to even work this is something that i never tried uh okay so and this thing has to be a class"
14713520,14728880," uh all right so i hope it's gonna actually crash uh free node"
14728880,14742640," okay so it's trying to do things uh but let's try the uh um non-secure one so if i remember correctly the"
14742640,14749520," plain socket the plain text is this right but the plain text is this um and what we're trying to do"
14749520,14764080," here we're just trying to receive uh yeah gpr um it works um so it works the only thing that doesn't work"
14764080,14772560," is uh is uh that we can even try to print that chunk but i'm not sure how to do that um so ada include"
14772560,14776320," do i just have ada"
14776320,14782320," so this is aws but uh do i have any other things"
14782960,14793360," okay um ada streams i need some functions to work with ada streams"
14793360,14804720," at least convert them to string so ada streams you have stream uh element and stream elements by the way"
14806720,14816320," uh stream element array stream element array okay um you can read and write and stuff like that and it"
14816320,14823280," would be nice for me to somehow turn it into a string"
14825760,14832480," and print on standard output okay so you can have a stream"
14832480,14839600," so ada text i o text streams cool"
14842560,14844880," oh you you this is a socket types okay"
14844880,14861520," i'm already tired content uh i want to finish this but i'm ready tired get them um"
14864720,14870880," and it's not really easy to understand what the fuck they're trying to do uh serialization function"
14870880,14883840," yeah all right so let's try to at least connect a via ssl let's try to connect via ssl"
14883840,14891360," maybe that will do the trick so the way we're going to do that is uh first we create a non-secure"
14891360,14896640," socket uh right then we need to turn it into a secure client uh secure client"
14896640,14906720," so maybe i'm going to literally call it like that uh client and this one is actually going to be a"
14906720,14913120," socket type from ssl um socket type"
14913120,14920560," oh it's not going to work that easily okay i'm really tired oh holy fuck like oh"
14920560,14921760," oh no i cannot"
14921760,14929840," it's hard it's hard man"
14929840,14941520," but we can try to at least uh turn stream element array into a string and print it at least we can"
14941520,14947040," try to do that at least we can try to do that uh serialization functions"
14950000,14959040," um okay uh ada print stream element array is it possible to do something like that"
14959040,14966400," uh should i start timing out people for telling me to use zig i think i should start doing that"
14966400,14973520," um like half of an hour time out every time somebody's mentioning music uh all right so uh"
14976000,14985040," efficient stream zero ports because you're not fucking helping seriously um"
14985040,15000640," so uh what we're doing here right um print stream not null access"
15005680,15011280," can i just use sprint so they show these signatures but i i would like to see examples"
15011280,15021200," uh they're not really useful these signatures are not very useful i think so uh yeah they're not very"
15021200,15029040," useful but we can try print chunk and it also accepts what it accepts upset all right or item or what was"
15029040,15033440," what was that what was the print uh item um"
15033440,15044320," um okay so 10 uh i i don't know like what does it do uh does it even explain anything um i don't know how to use that"
15044320,15048160," okay i have a chunk and i literally don't know what to do with that chunk"
15048160,15058480," so um yeah print is undefined okay so it's not even defined in streams um okay ada streams is there like at least"
15058480,15066400," example at least example because these signatures are not useful they're not explaining anything"
15066400,15072080," i just want an example that shows okay you have this stream or stream array this is the things you"
15072080,15076800," can do with them like that and this is how you print them how we can print them like it would be"
15076800,15081520," nice but this is not really useful i don't understand like what do you want from me um"
15081520,15088560," uh stream element is mod"
15088560,15096560," all right so apparently this is the only information we have about ada streams"
15096560,15103120," okay streams are powerful io mechanism that allows reading and writing any type of object to any type of"
15103120,15111200," medium uh network connection streams are cool examples uh abstract streams um"
15111200,15116880," okay so there is this thing i don't know what that is but um"
15116880,15121520," abstract streams civilization function"
15123280,15131360," uh how to use uh how to use that ada streams example a single example would be really appreciated like"
15131360,15136240," at least like get the gist of how to use this stuff because i don't understand how to use them"
15137040,15146720," um okay streams are your um fruit read where is the fruit though"
15151840,15166480," is is that it uh file and ios streams create and write to a stream create right to file is this it um"
15166480,15171440," uh standard library text io"
15171440,15173600," okay"
15176640,15183280," but where are the streams i don't see streams okay stream i know there we go uh are you gonna jump"
15183280,15190960," there thank you okay so but it's not what i'm using here i'm using some sort of array thingy i have no"
15190960,15199760," idea how to use it um stream access it doesn't explain anything this is not really useful um"
15203440,15214000," i don't know how to handle this everything um maybe like okay if i could find the source code for ada"
15214000,15219760," streams maybe i could find functions that consume string element array and do something with them"
15219760,15227440," but i don't know where these things are located so i found the place user share ada ada includes and it"
15227440,15236320," only contains aws there it doesn't contain anything else it contains this xml things um but where can"
15236320,15244240," i find the standard library of ada um like i don't know where i can find it um so ada streams"
15244240,15254320," so if i google something like that uh i just want to find the source code um so this is just streams io"
15255200,15263520," this is very close but not exactly because i'm importing not the stream io but the array um so is it"
15263520,15271760," possible to this is not really good package stream okay i think this is what i want so strill element"
15271760,15283360," okay okay okay okay okay okay okay um so you have a read right and you have a right"
15284640,15290720," root stream type root stream type root stream type is an abstract thingy here so um"
15290720,15299280," i think we need right right because the input is going to be stream element array"
15299280,15308400," and root stream type and what do you do the abstract type is the root type of the class of the stream so it"
15308400,15316560," feels like uh it feels like uh i have to have something that can be put there and maybe one of"
15316560,15323680," these things that can be put there is the standard output or something right i can try to write this"
15323680,15331360," thing into standard output but how can i do that so if i try to write um standard"
15333920,15346080," output chunk how can i like where can i get the standard output um where can i get it i'm not sure"
15348160,15362880," std out okay suppose now that one was to print the description for you to the standard the following"
15362880,15365600," int write"
15369040,15376720," text text text stream stream current output returns a stream access associated with the file given as the"
15376720,15377360," parameter"
15377360,15385520," okay you have to do this int to write but is do i need to do int to write"
15385520,15391760," print the description of 42 in the standard output this is not what it was"
15391760,15410480," uh okay so right uh current output text streams i also need to import text streams i presume"
15413200,15420960," all right so uh ada streams uh with ada streams text"
15420960,15428000," streams i'm pretty sure it makes sense but it's extremely confusing um"
15440160,15448480," alright this isn't how we can do that"
15448480,15458880," the package by the example has example of print function for int you can maybe adapt it to string"
15458880,15464640," maybe i just want something that would print something on the screen um okay"
15468000,15475200," current returns the stream access well like i just don't understand what how to use that it doesn't"
15475200,15482080," make any sense um like i wish it would just make some sort of sense it just doesn't make any sense"
15482080,15488080," um maybe it has to click or something it's hopefully probably not gonna it's not a predefined"
15488080,15495920," library unit missing uh okay three um what text streams"
15498800,15506960," text io oh oh my god oh my god okay um text io text streams"
15506960,15512320," uh yeah use text io i see"
15512320,15523360," i'm trying i'm starting to fade out okay okay let's list it's int is not visible"
15525200,15525440," why"
15525440,15533760," and uh non-visional it's missing okay so at 21"
15533760,15540960," okay there's like extra thing here that is not"
15540960,15547040," int is not visible why is it not visible i don't know"
15551120,15552480," scroll up to their example"
15552480,15557840," um doesn't help me i don't understand how to use it"
15557840,15563440," i don't understand it i don't understand anything it doesn't make any sense"
15563440,15577040," i just want to print this entire thing why why can't i just print that it's so bad it's so bad um"
15577840,15588640," chunk um do you have something like image uh chunk which i can pro just print on the standard output why"
15588640,15594960," is this so hard i have a chunk let me print it on standard output it's super easy"
15596960,15601920," uh i cannot do that on the both gifted the tier one sub to uh out nine thank you thank you and"
15601920,15609440," both for uh gifting uh at your one sub thank you for supporting the channel and uh online welcome to our epic ada club"
15611440,15616320," uh as integer oh holy fuck i already removed everything and not i didn't remove everything"
15616320,15624400," okay i'm just so frustrated that uh i wasted all of my energy and i cannot do anything anymore"
15625440,15637040," um expected type found type a stream element array okay um can i do this thing then stream element array"
15637040,15642160," uh print is undefined okay"
15642160,15647120," all right"
15649360,15663360," all right all right all right all right all right um"
15673120,15681920," so int it works for int um so it's a stream element array it's a stream element array and i just want to"
15681920,15692960," print it on the standard output ada stream element array to string that's the one thing i want"
15692960,15701760," it's the only thing i want like i don't even want that much in my life um okay stream okay serial port"
15701760,15707920," string to stream element okay is there any way to quickly do that please please tell me it's possible"
15707920,15715920," stack overflow you just thank you i can google too thank you so much for googling i literally looking at this thing"
15715920,15718480," oh my god"
15718480,15723760," you think i don't know how to google um"
15727840,15729920," okay okay stream element array string"
15729920,15731600," uh"
15731600,15735760," cool"
15735760,15741280," buffer"
15741280,15752080," wait a second you can actually just take this thing wait wait wait wait wait wait wait um"
15754240,15758800," can i can i do chunk right and what is st"
15758800,15761760," uh-huh"
15761760,15772960," can i write to text streams then wait a fucking second uh so i write it and m is an integer"
15772960,15774880," uh-huh"
15776560,15777680," so apparently"
15777680,15778240," so apparently"
15778240,15785760," so this doesn't make any sense so here's the buffer"
15785760,15789040," oh okay it's it's commented out um"
15789040,15795280," sir what is sir i didn't see sir where is sir"
15795280,15796400," uh"
15796400,15801440," serial communication it's a gnat it doesn't make any sense"
15803520,15807840," uh it's making sense the error is on line 23"
15807840,15812560," are you trolling me"
15812560,15816400," um"
15816400,15826480," the problem is not the error what the are you talking about you're trying to piss me off"
15826480,15830880," intentionally yeah i swear to god you're trying to piss me off um all right"
15830880,15839200," right attribute"
15839200,15851200," procedure as right is defined as follows to convert item to a sequence of stream elements"
15854800,15861520," i don't understand how to use it"
15861520,15877520," so um"
15881520,15882320," so um"
15882320,15884960," text streams"
15884960,15888320," stream current output"
15888320,15895680," attribute must be"
15895680,15899440," prefix of a right has to okay"
15899440,15908240," um"
15908240,15915440," okay"
15915440,15922800," i just have a stream element array how do i print it like it's how do i print it how can i output it"
15922800,15930400," like i don't understand uh like ah and just so bad oh my god"
15932400,15934800," i have no idea exactly just print"
15934800,15950000," ah stream uh add stream element array print okay uh it's holy is so bad like why is it so obscure"
15950000,15955600," though like okay like it wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't so obscure it's like we could at least"
15955600,15960560," figure it figure it out um where do we get it from by the way so we get it from receive"
15960560,15971120," examples are useless holy yes i didn't expect it like the rest of the language is so nice but"
15971120,15975200," all of a sudden this this piece of all of a sudden this piece of shit just hits and oh my god"
15975200,15985680," uh all right receive receive um so receive time out who wants to receive time out uh what"
15985680,15993840," do you call uh function net receive so we are in the in the net okay uh it's a classified knowledge"
15993840,15999200," yeah aws net uh ads yeah"
15999200,16002400," function receive"
16002400,16007920," uh all right read the chunk of data from returns this this call always"
16008880,16012000," uh all right so let's actually go into aws net adb"
16012000,16023040," can i can i go there yeah function receive uh all right so here is the element array elements of set"
16023040,16028160," and it just uses this receive okay so we need to take a look at another receive it's a procedure"
16028160,16033840," receive procedure receive there's no procedure receive oh my god"
16039360,16044960," there's only one receive holy where is the another one um"
16044960,16058560," there's also net std oh my god it's it's located at some other place oh shit okay um"
16063360,16066560," add add uh include add of the s"
16066560,16069360," uh"
16069360,16076160," receive uh let's take a look at this thing"
16076160,16084080," uh all right i think i did a fuck you back i'm not sure if i it's the correct way of doing that one"
16084080,16085600," um"
16085600,16090880," procedure there is procedure receive but there is no like"
16091920,16093520," oh there's web sockets look at that"
16093520,16107520," i just want to take a look at the implementation of that shit holy fuck okay"
16107520,16119520," return results"
16121920,16131520," so it redirects to all of this shit aws net std ads"
16131520,16136320," oh here it is"
16136320,16138400," having a phone"
16138400,16144480," um aws net std ads"
16144480,16146080," it doesn't"
16146080,16146480," it doesn't exist"
16146480,16146480," it doesn't exist"
16146480,16146560," it doesn't exist"
16146560,16146560," it doesn't exist"
16146560,16146640," it doesn't exist"
16146640,16147600," it doesn't exist"
16147600,16147840," it doesn't exist"
16147840,16148320," fuck me"
16148320,16150560," oh"
16150560,16166160," how do you do that"
16166160,16168240," how do you do that this is like a really classified knowledge holy shit um what i'm trying to find is actually okay i think i know what i tried i'm trying to find procedure"
16168240,16179520," procedure procedure receive"
16179520,16181520," procedure receive"
16181520,16183520," that's what i'm trying to find"
16183520,16186960," um okay so this is oh"
16186960,16188160," shit oh"
16188160,16188160," shit oh"
16188160,16188560," fuck"
16188560,16189360," um"
16189360,16196560," yeah i need to remove this thing"
16196560,16200560," uh"
16200560,16201600," so here's that"
16201600,16202880," it's abstract"
16202880,16204880," but we need specific implementation"
16204880,16209440," uh procedure receive okay so this is a specific implementation"
16209440,16214800," uh record with okay so they're they're all using all of this stuff"
16214800,16216400," uh"
16216400,16220480," overriding okay"
16220480,16224160," is there another implementation net ssl in mining"
16224160,16228480," memory receive stream memory read"
16228480,16233440," okay"
16233440,16236400," stream"
16239440,16241680," efficient stream array type"
16241680,16247120," integer"
16247120,16247440," right"
16247440,16252320," ada has a notion of streams that are much like those of other languages sequences of"
16252320,16257440," elements comprising values of arbitrary possibly different types placing a value into a stream is easy"
16257440,16260160," using the language defined stream attributes"
16260160,16267040," the programmer simply calls the type specific attribute routine and specifies the stream and the value"
16267040,16272160," for the example they place the integer value into the stream s one could do okay that makes sense"
16272160,16273520," uh right"
16273520,16277760," okay i now want to extract"
16277760,16285760," so strictly speaking s is not the stream but rather an access value designated stream an integer right"
16285760,16290880," will convert the value into the array of stream elements essentially an array of storage elements"
16290880,16295680," and then put them into the stream designated by s actually placing the bytes into the stream is"
16295680,16299920," accomplished by dynamically dispatching to procedure okay you're basically serializing all of that"
16299920,16308080," uh right you write to the procedure okay i'm starting to understand that uh read a the streams read and"
16311840,16314960," all right i think i know um"
16314960,16318960," uh so here is that uh"
16318960,16322720," uh i want to read a char"
16322720,16327600," uh all right i'm reading the char character um"
16327600,16332400," you have to know the uh the item"
16334080,16339040," uh read so the stream root stream type no it doesn't make any sense"
16339040,16344560," excuse me"
16344560,16348480," so the type is stream element"
16348480,16351040," array"
16359920,16364640," they don't even mention it properly in above we can simply convert a value of item"
16364640,16367920," over a type buffer to a value of type stream element array"
16367920,16374640," so we work with pointers instead we define access type designated a stream element array that is"
16374640,16384720," exact size of the term stream elements"
16384720,16393680," what the fuck do you want like how more obscure can you make this holy shit um"
16396560,16401440," like i'm okay this is extremely obscure obscure up obscure api um"
16401440,16407200," oh"
16407200,16413760," what is going on like i'm actually confused holy"
16413760,16422480," root stream type up until this moment it was clear okay"
16423280,16431760," i would assume that is stream element array an array a stream"
16431760,16448240," so can i read like i would expect that i can uh read from it okay stream element is"
16449680,16458640," standard storage unit stream array is array of uh stream element of set of alias of stream it's array"
16458640,16465280," of stream elements and stream elements is a single storage unit and root stream type is something"
16465280,16471600," more abstract so it's it's an array of units uh unit storage and they're probably bytes or something"
16471600,16478960," like that right so uh you can write an item which is a stream into this thing"
16480240,16481120," and then"
16481120,16486640," this is the output so basically if you have a stream"
16486640,16492480," you're writing at the same time you also can take this stream thingy"
16492480,16496480," the language defined root stream type"
16496480,16503200," deployed package streams the user defined read buffer write buffer could you do string"
16504960,16509680," read some string that's a good idea"
16509680,16519600," but it could be more of an unbound string the problem with strings is that they have to know"
16519600,16529360," what they have to have a specific um size and they have to be initialized so um let's define some string"
16529360,16536320," this is a good idea and bound string uh which probably doesn't have to be defined uh i think"
16536320,16542080," it's more of a like we can try uh we can try uh uh with a whatever i'm already tired"
16542080,16550960," unbound string so we're reading that into some string and this is a chunk and uh then we can try to print"
16552000,16556640," uh yeah let's just try to compile this into our stuff um"
16556640,16564560," okay so missing unbound string is not defined uh first of all because we have to uh import something"
16564560,16570800," uh other unbound unbound unbounded and i think yeah unbound it i fucked it up"
16570800,16572960," unbound the string"
16572960,16580000," uh it's also not visible because yeah we have to import something unbound"
16580000,16587040," did string come on uh so what do i have to import what do i have to input please tell me"
16588320,16602720," uh ada strings unbounded okay cool uh with ada strings unbounded use ada strings unbounded there"
16602720,16611040," we go so if i try to compile that now uh and all right so and that one has to be unbounded uh"
16612960,16617120," so there is no read attribute phone binding string incoming"
16617120,16622560," expected access to class print is undefined"
16622560,16627600," oh it failed here what wait wait a second"
16627600,16634480," uh expected access to root stream compilation phase failed"
16639600,16645520," what um all right so class"
16645520,16648480," um"
16648480,16667280," found okay tag type required found private type it oh it requires type i think"
16669600,16675760," uh wait wait wait holy shit okay i'm don't know what i am"
16675760,16683520," i'm closing everything one more time"
16683520,16694960," hey the stream elements array to string i already tried that um but i just can't"
16696560,16701600," sockets common transports streams google groups"
16701600,16707920," holy shit"
16707920,16710720," okay"
16710720,16715040," stream"
16720960,16732320," okay okay so let's use this message"
16732320,16744560," fuck yeah look at that"
16746960,16747760," stream elementary"
16747760,16748000," stream elementary"
16748000,16755200," fucking thumb"
16755200,16762960," holy shit like why the only way to know how to work with this thing is to find it in a very"
16762960,16769120," fucking obscure place somewhere holy shit um okay"
16772000,16778720," okay i think i think i think we can we can at least try to print already um so here's the here's the chunk"
16778720,16786480," that we received uh and what i need to do is i uh in chunk range"
16786480,16796320," and you loop over it um like and loop like this nice language but well nice documentation rather i would say"
16796880,16802400," um so here's um so here's the output line and oh you can just index it you can just"
16802400,16806320," fucking index it it's a it's an array why didn't i think about it"
16806320,16811360," yeah it's defined as an alias of an array you can just fucking index it i suppose"
16811360,16813840," uh so in the output line"
16816560,16829040," uh really uh so this output line and is output line even a well-known thing uh output line is a okay"
16829040,16837920," uh procedure dump right so you fill up the output line"
16844640,16854640," holy okay so he has yeah he has a buffer he fills up that buffer until it's completely filled up and"
16854640,16862880," then i don't know why i say here like they do that and uh then they just print on the uh on the stand"
16862880,16870560," output okay that makes sense can i allocate the string of the size of the chunk is is that possible"
16871200,16879280," i think i think i should be able to because um okay stream and stream like last i should be able to do"
16879280,16893280," something like last string um output right string from one uh type a string from one to uh socket it's"
16893280,16906880," actually not socket so let's put it here from uh chunk last right from chunk last um do i need to"
16906880,16910560," initialize it i don't think i need to initialize it if i have something like this so we know what size"
16910560,16916880," and stuff like that so we're iterating through all of that and what i'm doing essentially i do an output"
16917440,16925600," i uh and i'm assigning chunk i to it so essentially i'm copying this thing like that right it will that"
16925600,16934320," compile that's a good question uh expected type standard type uh instead of integer um but gut"
16935680,16946400," stream elements of set uh all right can i just do something like two integer like element of set is"
16946400,16957760," image last no no image is to convert to strings uh it's to convert to strings um i think it's something like"
16960800,16968640," uh element uh uh procedure procedure procedure dump uh index natural"
16968640,16978400," and what element what is element of set though"
16978400,16988960," uh stream elements already so element of set is probably set to something uh i want to know the the type"
16990800,16993920," um stream element stream"
16993920,16999600," of set is a range implementation defined okay"
16999600,17001360," uh"
17001360,17014720," ranges implementation defined so you cannot use the element of set uh to do things like that but we know"
17014720,17020640," the size of the chunk we know the size of the chunk and we know that it's not going to be super big"
17020800,17026560," uh maybe uh maybe we can do something like length can you take the length of the chunk"
17026560,17030400," is that okay you can do that nice"
17030400,17034880," found stream element of set okay"
17034880,17042640," uh ada to integer integer"
17042640,17047600," convert string to integer maybe we can use the same method to"
17047600,17049760," integer"
17049760,17055920," integer value okay so can i do integer"
17055920,17058240," value"
17058240,17061600," uh-huh"
17061600,17068720," expected okay it expects strings so we can just do it like that okay"
17070800,17081680," safer to do yes actually good point but um okay that's actually a good point let's actually use that"
17081680,17089200," and maybe uh it's gonna be like this first last but both of them are stream of sets so they're not"
17089200,17096160," usable for us yeah you see their stream of sets they are not necessarily integers so it's not gonna really"
17096160,17096720," work like that"
17096720,17100640," casted"
17100640,17102720," has integer"
17102720,17104160," what"
17104160,17107920," are you talking about you don't make any sense"
17107920,17112080," all right so and by the way when i do a wrench"
17114320,17121200," uh what if i try to print this entire thing is it even it's a stream element right so it's a stream"
17121200,17130560," element so uh put line so what type is it it's probably going to be a stream offset"
17132880,17138880," so what's the type expected type standard it's element of set okay"
17138880,17144560," uh can you do something like this actually okay i just can do something on this"
17144560,17146640," uh"
17146640,17150560," no candidate interpolation matched okay"
17152240,17158880," all right all right so we have different types of medium and we have a different types of indices"
17158880,17165440," and this is why you have this output buffer that is so weird all right so uh this is probably what"
17165440,17168880," we have to do i'm gonna do like 120 um"
17172720,17183600," 248 496 yes so this is what we're going to have here and um so we're doing the range right so we're"
17183600,17190000," doing the range um and we're also going to have additional index which is the integer right so this"
17190000,17196960," is the integer and it's initially zero uh right so and how we're going to do that i'm going to do output"
17198000,17210080," uh index equal chunk pi um so and uh what's going to be the next thing so we also have to increment"
17210080,17219520," index here as well um i recommend index here as well um since i know it's not going to be greater than"
17219520,17233520," that so i don't really care that much um"
17233520,17244000," so is it gonna do think let's actually try to compile that"
17245760,17252560," uh okay and there we go we also have a stream element and how is it done in the example by the way"
17252560,17257760," uh how did i lose the example nobody knows the example"
17257760,17260880," uh dump"
17260880,17273200," aha oh this is actually very interesting uh natural plus one hex holy"
17275760,17281600," um"
17281600,17282800," you know what"
17282800,17294320," so and it prints it does it what is verbose by the way"
17294320,17297360," verbose"
17300320,17306000," why what is verbose where is it where is it defined the focus verbose"
17306000,17313360," uh i don't understand it feels like a procedure"
17313360,17319440," holy oh my god uh okay so"
17321120,17323760," so i'm gonna literally copy paste it here so bad"
17323760,17337120," um okay so we have something like this which is interesting i'm not gonna lie so the output line"
17337120,17343120," is defined in a different place output line output line is a string of this specific type"
17343760,17351840," um and also hex yeah it will also probably uh i didn't know you have to implement so much just to"
17351840,17358400," facilitate all of that uh that's actually okay that's very strange"
17363680,17367200," do you still think others interesting yes i still think so"
17367200,17374880," are you trying to piss me off intentionally i wouldn't really suggest doing it right now"
17376560,17393120," okay so um let me try to do that"
17401120,17402000," is undefined"
17402000,17402000," is undefined"
17402000,17408400," oh you you do trying to piss me off intentionally okay so please don't do that"
17408400,17411200," because i really like it you don't want to buy me"
17411200,17415200," uh okay verbose is not defined we need to uh"
17415200,17422400," understand where can we get the verbose but it doesn't really make any sense in my opinion because um"
17422400,17427760," yeah i think it's just like you can remove it because in this particular context"
17428480,17431200," uh it's it's it's not needed at all uh"
17431200,17442800," it's not needed at all okay so uh expect it okay so it's not solving any pro okay well this is what we"
17442800,17449200," have here uh-huh uh-huh and uh let's dump the chunk so probably don't need any of this stuff"
17449200,17453920," uh all right i'm missing semicolon um"
17456800,17462080," okay it compiles uh so essentially you have to do all this yeah"
17462080,17474000," this is so dumb this is really bad seriously like you you have to map all of this like in here"
17474000,17475520," oh my god"
17475520,17477040," uh"
17477040,17484880," strange this is really strange that this the library itself just doesn't allow you to do that easily but"
17484880,17489600," maybe i just don't know it really well right maybe i just don't know it really well and if i"
17489600,17498880," try to do for bsd and that's for bsd but build free node uh and um it doesn't do anything probably"
17498880,17500960," because i'm using some uh"
17500960,17506640," okay we're using like a proper things here but it doesn't print anything"
17507680,17514480," uh so if i try to do it like that it's going to be print uh chunk right did we receive the chunk"
17518160,17530000," um gpr build p free node gpr so is it going to do a thing uh print uh was it put line it was put line"
17530000,17538720," yes yes um"
17538720,17545760," am i using the wrong host oh porting yes i'm using the wrong part"
17550640,17555680," okay so it received the chunk now uh i'm gonna dump the chunk"
17555680,17571120," cool well at least it's something this is what we received from uh from the free node server this is"
17571120,17579200," what we managed to receive from it which is not bad uh by the way i want to put some info here right"
17579200,17591840," stolen uh like note stolen from uh this specific place right so just to be clear um so here is an index we"
17591840,17604000," use natural index uh then we take a stream which has its own index we divide it by 16 um convert it to"
17604000,17609520," natural and stuff like that okay that makes sense i i see what they're trying to do here i see what they're"
17609520,17619600," trying to do here um yeah so you need a natural index a natural index"
17621840,17633520," all right so divided by 16 and you can cast it to nature but can you cast it to a character instead"
17633520,17648320," that'll be highly interesting okay so for i in uh chunk uh range and right so we have a chunk i so this"
17648320,17655920," thing is a string element and what i want to do here is converted to char but i'm not sure if it's gonna"
17655920,17665520," really work that well right so the output is gonna be a string from this thing uh 96 right so it's gonna be"
17665520,17670320," here um and we need an index uh right in the index"
17673040,17686160," uh you're not helping express mind uh natural is gonna be zero uh all right so output index"
17686160,17694080," okay so this is probably not how it has to be done but i hope uh maybe there is like a chr"
17694960,17699360," uh but uh like in pascal but we'll see how it goes index"
17699360,17709040," so let's try to compile this thing uh char is not visible all right so um"
17709040,17718880," ada character by code how is that so maybe yeah first of all it has to be converted to natural"
17719920,17726800," maybe that's what we have to do and then we'll character how to store uh well in pascal you i'm"
17726800,17732320," pretty sure you have like something like chr but i would expect that there's something like that in ada"
17732320,17741040," as well um okay ada chr and or d you know these things how to do this so instead of like giving me"
17741040,17746000," this lecture you could have at least tell me how to do chr and or d that would be actually helpful"
17746000,17747680," um okay"
17747680,17751200," character maybe it's character"
17751200,17753360," uh"
17753360,17759680," all right so character codes ada"
17763120,17772400," character character pose wow okay cool thank you so much uh character uh was it well yes i think it"
17772400,17776640," was well and it seems to be working cool um yeah"
17776640,17786640," yep all right uh and then we can try to print this line like put"
17788480,17792720," uh line it was a top line okay so it's gonna get output"
17792720,17799600," okay so three no"
17799600,17808880," uh index check file okay so uh let me see so index is ah it has to be one yes of course"
17815920,17818320," all right okay okay so we got some garbage that's actually pretty cool"
17818320,17825600," so this is probably because maybe i really up something somewhere"
17825600,17835760," um i would expect this to be like a number like a byte number of some sort"
17839120,17847360," so when we go back to what it outputted like 3a all of them seem like ascii values right so we don't"
17847360,17848800," they're asking"
17848800,17855680," so the question is why it didn't work"
17865680,17875760," it didn't work"
17875760,17881040," so here is the"
17881040,17885920," and it's also plus one why why the fuck it is plus one"
17885920,17891040," so the natural ah because it's an index it has to be an index yes i see"
17893040,17905200," um"
17905200,17905200," so"
17905200,17905200," so"
17905200,17905200," so"
17905200,17911200," so"
17923040,17923760," okay"
17923760,17924640," is that because"
17924640,17928320," well this is supposed to be"
17928320,17930480," wait"
17930480,17935040," what is the plain text is it really a plain text"
17935040,17939440," because it would explain if it was a secure connection"
17939440,17944160," wait a second free node uh connect to free node"
17945920,17948800," six six six seven is correct so okay"
17948800,17953680," uh look at the first line it's there yeah"
17953680,17960160," plain uh for plain text you're printing some garbage afterwards"
17962080,17964560," oh shit i see oh okay"
17964560,17969120," that means it works as expected it works as expected"
17969120,17975120," i assume that everything was garbage so if only the first part is not garbage it is"
17975120,17977200," exactly what i expected so everything's okay"
17977200,17987280," holy fuck okay so um yeah that's that's okay um so for i in"
17987280,17991280," uh output output range right"
17991280,17999440," so you're printing memory i was actually printing or not initialized memory"
17999440,18000640," um"
18000640,18007760," i think you can also do slices we can try to slice it but i need to know the uh"
18007760,18009760," the chunk length"
18009760,18016240," yeah yeah one thing we do we can we can try to initialize it another thing we can try to do is to"
18016240,18020320," well we can try to allocate exactly as needed"
18021040,18028800," that's one thing we can do um so uh something like length right and uh then we can do a natural"
18028800,18033120," right and since we have our own index that we maintain"
18033120,18038960," using first as last is not necessary i'm saying that for those people who are constantly concerned"
18038960,18044560," about that and potentially didn't leave the stream okay and that's why i'm using length"
18044560,18049360," instead of first and last does that make sense okay cool so um"
18051040,18057040," uh i wonder if i need to do nature i think it has to be like an integer or something like that"
18057040,18063600," i do know about that aspect of ada okay thank you very much um all right"
18063600,18074880," uh gpr build and it's gonna be uh p a free node uh gpr"
18076400,18084000," okay it does compile cool um so now we're gonna always allocate only as much as needed which is"
18084000,18092560," pretty cool and uh there we go this worked the mercy either the more it feels like whoever made"
18092560,18099680," a vhd really loved add well it's a language both of these languages were actually created at the time"
18099680,18107120," when this kind of syntax was popular so it's a very old syntax right so that's what it is it's"
18107120,18112880," a very old syntax uh there was like a trend on making languages look like it i don't think"
18112880,18118320," there was like anyone who really liked it it's like when you create a new language like today"
18118320,18123920," what's going to be the syntax that you're going to choose it's probably going to be c like syntax"
18123920,18129440," because it's the syntax of the of the error right of this error and maybe in the future we're going"
18129440,18134320," to have different trends on syntaxes and people will look at this like c like languages and say"
18134320,18142880," what what a boomer boomer syntax similar to this one um so for example sql has also a similar syntax"
18145280,18153200," all right so um yeah now we can read all of that uh we managed to finally convert all of this thing okay"
18153200,18161440," so i think the the main problem was caused by uh me being tired right so if i was a little bit less"
18161440,18170240," tired maybe i would figure out that a little bit faster uh but yeah because the only thing that"
18170240,18176000," were needed for me to figure out how to do this thing is to notice that stream element array is an"
18176000,18182720," alias to an array right and i know like i knew that i knew this information but i didn't make the next"
18182720,18190720," logical step okay if it's just an alias to an array well let's just index that thing then like why didn't"
18190720,18196320," i make that next logical step uh probably because i'm just tired so that was the problem i guess"
18199280,18214160," so yeah that's probably what's a problem um okay so it's a ssl uh this one is a plain plain text"
18214160,18220960," was originally developed at the uh behest of the us department of defense oh okay that's actually"
18220960,18227920," very interesting so maybe it's like a thing like us military likes to like likes this kind of syntax"
18229040,18235600," um all right so okay it starts to make sense it starts to make sense at least"
18235600,18243600," all of the pieces uh fit together so maybe the next time i'm gonna have to work with the streams"
18243600,18247600," it's not going to be that much of a pain in the ass i should probably stopped an hour ago so"
18247600,18253680," just to save my sanity uh anyway so this is another example"
18258640,18268320," uh so git uh status uh let's add readme free node and src so this is the status and let's commit"
18268320,18282240," uh add free node example and let's push that right into the repo let's push that right into the repo uh if"
18282240,18288960," you're interested in this stupid examples that we came up with uh you can find them here uh i still wish"
18288960,18297440," uh we had a little bit more time right because i still want to figure out how to do an ssl connection"
18297440,18304400," without uh you know this certificate certificate problem right and once we figure out how to do an ssl"
18304400,18313920," connection um we could try to um basically use that uh info irc um"
18313920,18321600," i have two ideas actually is the first one is to make uh irc"
18321600,18328080," ada irc dependent on aws which is not that good of an idea because it's too fat of a dependency"
18328960,18333920," uh and the second idea which is a little bit better is to try to surgically remove"
18333920,18343360," the ssl in like code from aws into its self-contained thingy so we can have ssl uh"
18343360,18350560," sockets like library that uh library for other that can do ssl sockets and integrate it into the library like"
18350560,18359520," uh ada irc so the irc can have like ssl support and whatnot um so but we don't really have time"
18359520,18366640," to do that anymore because i'm streaming for five hours uh but i guess we uh we learned something uh"
18366640,18371600," yeah i guess we learned something i learned a lot today i learned a lot today but unfortunately it is"
18371600,18377920," time for me uh to go boys and girls it is time for me to go thanks everyone who's watching me right"
18377920,18384400," now i really appreciate it i have a good one and i see you all tomorrow tomorrow uh we're supposed to"
18384400,18388320," have a game development stream and i think we're gonna have a game development stream because i really"
18388320,18393920," want to work on this game a little bit we need to do some stuff uh check out our schedule for more"
18393920,18401520," information on uh different projects we're working on and check out our what's channel uh where we"
18401520,18406960," archive all of our streams this stream is going to be there but tomorrow we upload them on the next day"
18406960,18413120," and check out the discord our discord server for offline discussion with the community we have a"
18413120,18421200," pretty cozy community uh yeah so and let's maybe rate somebody we haven't rated anybody for quite some time"
18421840,18429280," is anyone streaming ada i actually saw people streaming ada on science and technology section so"
18429280,18434720," be uh marvin is he doing an english stream"
18434720,18447760," yeah people doing ada on uh yeah as they're doing i really hope i pronounce your name correctly um yeah she"
18447760,18456800," she doesn't dream she actually inspired me to to look into aws because i saw her stream um all right so uh"
18456800,18471040," i think i'm gonna raid this spherical cow i forgot i forgot the specific spelling of his nickname uh and i wish"
18471040,18477840," the website was a little bit faster uh it doesn't really show me that it's really bad uh can i just"
18477840,18483440," zoom out a little bit i cannot zoom out it's less than possible if i hide the chat can i will i be able"
18483440,18495760," to see um no i still not able to see this is such a horrible website holy fuck um all right um how can i extend the"
18495760,18503520," the left panel this is so bad like for me it has to be like this size there we go only then i can extend"
18503520,18506320," okay so it's not true streaming um"
18509600,18518080," absolutely horrible websites holy shit um kpm marin he's probably"
18518080,18528160," okay he's doing english streams so it's actually written so what is the union fine time complexity"
18528160,18529600," is that disjoint unions"
18529600,18536240," it kind of feels like disjoint unions but i don't think it's just joint unions i think it's just some"
18536800,18546240," some sort of unions okay um i remember this data structure which one uh union find i don't remember"
18546240,18546640," this one"
18546640,18555120," i'll probably look into it a little bit later um okay"
18555120,18563600," it's like half of the time i'm just waiting for twitch to load up like that doesn't happen with any of"
18563600,18567840," the website i use seriously it's so bad uh all right"
18567840,18591040," i was ready for the rates get ready for the rate boys and girls and i see you all uh tomorrow love you"
