880,5920," looks like we're live uh hello everyone and welcome to yet another azuzin session"
5920,12160," i hope you can hear me well so i'm probably too a little bit far away from my mic"
12160,15920," uh let's let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start the stream"
15920,29440," uh so of course discord um okay that's cool uh red circle live on twitch and what are we doing"
29440,37840," today on twitch.television uh we're doing uh graphics and see on linux without opengl isn't"
37840,43760," that exciting i hope it sounds exciting exciting enough that you will click on that stream and watch"
43760,52560," an epic software development with zozin uh didn't pink anyway so i just wanted to ping everyone who's"
52560,58880," interested in being pinged and there we go the stream has been officially started has been officially"
58880,65360," forwarded so today uh we're going to continue developing olivets which is um a graphics"
65360,69520," library that we've been developing for quite some time i think like three or four months already"
69520,74480," uh right so you can find this thing in here and i'm going to also put that in the description i"
74480,80720," think i forgot to prepare my description file for today's stream yeah i did in fact forget to do that"
80720,92480," so zero seven uh 12 2022 right so this is references and uh this is the source code right and also"
92480,100240," usually put some sort of a title in here so i can later go back and recall uh what stream this thing"
100240,108800," belongs to there we go all right so uh yesterday we were working on bilinear interpolation uh that's"
108800,115280," right so if we take a look at one of the examples right so let me rebuild demos specifically squish"
115280,123440," demo for sdl right so i'm building very specific demo and if i run this specific demo uh like so"
123440,131680," uh you will notice right so that we have this pixelated situation going on even though uh it kind"
131680,138800," of sort of anti-aliased but it's anti-aliased with huge pixels this is because in reality it's not anti-aliased"
138800,145200," and anti-aliasing comes from the image itself it's the image itself that provides anti-aliasing but"
145200,151600," it's not enough when you actually stretch it so it still looks a bit pixelated uh on the previous"
151600,158560," stream we explored how to do so-called bilinear interpolation that allows you to um you know smooth"
158560,163360," it out smooth the pixels out so let's actually see how it's going to look like if we enable the"
163360,170560," bilinear interpolation so if we take a look at demo and uh take a look at the squish and here we just do"
170560,178800," blend uh but if we do copy bilinear i think this is how i do that and then i rebuild this specific"
178800,185760," example super quick and then just run the specific example uh you will notice that it's not uh like"
185760,191920," it's much smoother now right all of the lines are sort of like interpolated and stuff right so you can"
191920,200160," see how smooth it is now right and uh we did that specifically for rectangular textures right"
200160,207200," specifically for rectangular textures but uh what's interesting is that um when i was when i'm"
207200,214880," developing this library there's two kinds of functions that start to emerge during developing this library"
214880,221520," rectangular functions that work with specifically access aligned boundary box right rectangles that are not"
221520,228560," rotated right so they're uh their uh boundaries are access aligned right and another kind of functions"
228560,235520," the ones that work with triangles right and they kind of like have a lot of symmetry between them"
235520,242480," right they have a lot of symmetry like one stuff that is implemented for rectangular functions it's also"
242480,250080," have like a analog in the triangular ones and this is one of those situations right this is one of the"
250080,257120," the situation we implemented by linear interpolation only for the aabbs uh but now uh we also have"
257120,264480," triangles that also can do the textures for instance if i do triangle tech um i think triangle tech 3d i think"
264480,273360," something like this um don't quite remember so i think uh i don't have everything built at 3d tech"
274000,282560," right it's called 3d tech sdl right as you can see uh here we have a textured triangle right so a texture"
282560,289440," triangle but you can see that uh it is not properly interpolated it's actually kind of cool since it's in 3d"
289440,298080," space um their pixels are sort of distorted you can see that their pixels are sort of like these diamonds uh"
298080,303840," this is actually kind of cool uh this is because yeah because they're all at like at the at an angle"
303840,309520," or something like that uh but yeah we still need to implement interpolation for for the functions that"
309520,314400," work with triangles to actually get rid of this kind of situation as well and this is going to be the"
314400,321280," plan for today right so we're going to be basically porting our rectangular bilinear interpolation code to"
321280,327120," triangles right so and we'll see how it goes we'll see how it goes"
327120,332720," so uh thank you so much for the subscription for ed uh for seven months thank you thank you thank you"
332720,341280," uh so let me find the function that is doing bilinear interpolation right so here is the sprite copy bilinear"
341280,345120," so it's a little bit um messy"
345120,350880," in fact the entire library is kind of messy so if you take a look at the functions of the library right"
350880,355920," it's kind of like a soup of different functions and i'm doing that intentionally"
355920,362160," i'm just basically throwing at this library everything i know about like computer graphics"
362160,370800," right and just see what kind of patterns um appear out of that and then um when i throw enough into this"
370800,375920," thing i start to actually organize all of that stuff so right now it's just like a it's it's literally"
375920,380320," super functions it just doesn't have any system or anything that but for instance"
381120,386000," as i already mentioned some sort of a pattern started to emerge as i already said we're starting"
386000,392400," to have like two groups of functions the functions that work with aabbs and similar functions that work"
392400,399200," with triangles right and they're very much similar right so they have like a symmetrical situation just"
399200,404800," like with bilinear interpolation but it's just like you have to write specific code for for those things"
404800,410000," so maybe in the future i'm just going to come up with the naming scheme too so to emphasize what kind of group"
410000,417920," this function belongs to is that aabb function or is that a triangle function uh right so and we'll see"
417920,426000," how it goes hello hello everyone how it goes then all right so"
428400,436880," uh this is where we do bilinear interpolation right so we iterate through the pixels and then uh"
436880,444080," we calculate the texture position and then we calculate the interpolation right so when we"
444080,449920," complete calculate back the texture position we can actually hit between the pixels right and we"
449920,456560," calculate how we calculate how where exactly we hit between the pixels of the texture and based on that"
456560,463440," between pixel position we calculate we blend the colors accordingly to create smooth interpolation"
463440,470000," um right uh so interestingly enough if we want to do this kind of stuff with the triangle right so"
470000,480560," the function that we use for the triangle is uh triangle 3uv it accepts the triangle coordinates and then the"
480560,487360," texture coordinates and the z coordinates to accommodate for distortion because of the projection on the screen"
487360,492000," on the screen right because we have a 3uv projection and because of that the texture coordinates has"
492000,498800," coordinates have to be adapted accordingly uh right so if we take a look at how this function is implemented"
498800,503920," we're iterating through each individual pixel over the triangle using various centric coordinates"
504480,513040," right and then uh eventually we compute the texture coordinate texture x and texture y right so as you"
513040,517680," can see we have a bunch of computations in here that take into account the projection the z coordinate"
517680,525120," the texture coordinate and we end up with just two integers texture x and texture y right and uh we just"
525120,530720," grab that pixel and put it into the place where we want to put it and eventually we have like a textured 3d"
530720,537920," triangle right so and here we just have to do a similar situation right the pixel that we compute"
537920,546560," back into the texture so you can clearly see here right uh so it probably hits somewhere between textures"
546560,551760," as well right it probably hits somewhere between textures as well and we need to do the same thing"
551760,557920," we just need to see where exactly it hits between the uh between the pixels and just blend neighboring"
557920,564240," pixels accordingly to create this smooth transition right it's pretty much the same thing we just need"
564240,571200," to port it to this place uh what i'm thinking by the way uh since i'm gonna be doing the same thing"
571200,578480," uh in two places maybe it makes sense to actually extract that uh bilinear interpolation process into"
578480,585520," separate functions so in some sort of a function that accepts the texture the coordinates including the"
585520,590400," the precise coordinates between the pixels and this thing should return as the interpolated value"
590400,605840," i think that's actually kind of cool yeah yeah yeah so that's precisely what we're gonna do"
605840,613440," uh maybe down question why don't you handle square rectangles with two triangles because it's a different"
613440,626960," input different kind of input uh right and also performance applications for rectangles and triangles we use"
626960,634000," different algorithms that have different performance and depending on your situation right for instance maybe you"
634000,640000," you never actually draw anything but access align boundary box it would make sense for you to use only"
640000,645040," access aligned boundary box api always and be a little bit faster because you don't have to compute"
645040,649360," complicated barycentric coordinates and then to play too much between the triangles"
649360,658400," right so essentially it's all about assumptions just because you're limited to a certain kind of shapes you can"
658400,666720," do more assumptions that actually allow you to improve performance for instance right so it's not about only"
666720,672880," just a visual part but it's about like uh different assumptions and stuff like that this library is not a black box"
672880,686560," that's an interesting thing i don't like a code that is black box where i don't understand how it works i just throw data into it and it just outputs back i know a lot of people kind of comfortable with this kind of thing because they're afraid of"
686560,692800," uh cognitive overload but what i found is that the more the most flexible code is actually very"
692800,698560," much open and you can look inside and understand how certain things works and rearrange certain things"
698560,704000," in a way that uh that is more suitable for your task and this is what this library is all about"
704000,714960," does it make sense uh i mean i tried yeah anyway um if you didn't know english before the last 10 years how did you code"
714960,723520," uh we have a lot of translated materials to russian um at least 10 years ago i don't know how it is for now"
723520,732400," uh but at least 10 years ago we had a very active uh russian-speaking community who that was translating a lot of stuff to russian"
732400,739040," right so like i'm not really participating in russian-speaking community anymore so i don't know"
739040,744080," how active they are in translating things to russian so yeah"
744080,751520," actually 10 years ago you could have be a pretty good programmer in russia without even knowing english"
751520,757360," right because there was a lot of materials like in russian translated uh by some other people"
760000,766320," will you get rid of sdl at some point sdl is not part of the library anyway it's a part of the demos"
766320,768480," right but it's not a part of the library"
768480,785680," okay my answer regarding like aabbs and trials makes sense okay i'm really about that i managed to explain"
785680,793840," that because it's it's very subtle right it's very subtle especially in the in this modern programming"
793840,800400," culture where everyone just tries to treat everything as a black box and instead of going inside of the"
800400,806160," black box and fixing the problems within the black box people just tend to throw more code on top and"
806160,812560," making a bigger black box right and because there is this kind of structure of software culture of software"
812560,818480," development it's really difficult to justify the things that i'm proposing usually right because"
818480,824400," i'm all all about like stripping of the obstructions and making things simpler because this simple thing"
824400,831120," has less bugs and actually simpler systems are much more safe because they are simple you can actually"
831120,836640," review them and make sure that they're simple they're safe right so it's kind of difficult to prove that"
836640,844400," complicated the system is safe uh so and because like because of this like very persistent culture"
844400,849760," i'm a little bit anxious to to explain this idea i'm always afraid that people will just"
849760,864480," not only not understand me but instantly reject whatever i say right um it's kind of i don't know"
866320,871040," um all right so let's continue uh how are we going to be implementing this function so"
871040,880480," uh let's call it olivets uh bilinear uh pixel right so we already have something like olivets"
880480,890720," pixel uh which is a macro right which is a macro and uh it just gets the current pixel but maybe we need"
890720,896000," to have something like pixel bilinear right but this one is not a macro so we have to keep that in mind"
896800,902720," uh so this thing is going to return the core of the pixel right so we also need to accept some sort of a"
902720,910480," texture in here right so this is going to be canvas um let's call it texture and this is where it become"
910480,918080," becomes rather interesting right because we don't pass um"
920480,927840," we don't pass the floating point coordinates right so what we need to pass in here we should pass not"
927840,933840," a pixel of the texture coordinates right we don't really care about the pixel of the texture coordinate"
933840,938320," we put a pixel plus the fractional part uh right"
939440,954160," so let me actually try to draw that and and see how it's gonna go"
960240,968240," if no one will try to reinvent the wheel sometime in the future we won't be able to fix the wheels"
968240,974000," that break this is actually way more um complicated than you think"
975040,982480," uh we as a humanity literally reinvent the wheels all the time i would even argue that reinvent the wheel"
982480,989760," is actually very bad analogy to software development because again humanity reinvents the wheel literally"
989760,997360," reinvents the wheel all the time every time you make a new vehicle there are people who literally sit down"
997360,1001120," and design new wheels for that vehicle"
1001120,1004800," some sort of like a heavy machine vehicle"
1006720,1013680," like they literally reinvent the wheel why the are they to do that why can't you just take a wooden wheel"
1013680,1020480," from the like thousand years ago why you reinvent the wheel it's a in fact it's it's literally a bad analogy"
1020480,1025360," because people do that all the time and it's a very useful activity so"
1025360,1033440," it's just a bad analogy that doesn't really hold it against reality because we do that all the time and it's"
1033440,1039600," very useful without reinventing the wheel all the time we wouldn't go anywhere uh right because we"
1039600,1048960," won't have the right wheels um all right so imagine that you have a texture uh right and imagine that the"
1048960,1056960," texture is uh three by three right so the function that i'm trying to develop will accept the uh pixel"
1056960,1063200," coordinates but it won't accept pixel coordinates from zero to three in integer"
1063680,1066080," right right it needs to accept them in float"
1066080,1075440," meaning that you can hit not only just a pixel but within the pixel you can uh hit in any place"
1075440,1079680," place within the pixel and depending on that place you're going to have a different color"
1079680,1084800," because the color of the neighboring pixels is going to affect uh what kind of color you're going"
1084800,1088080," to end up with and this is by this is what bilingual interpolation is all about"
1089040,1097680," right uh so and we need to put floats in there we need to put floats in there"
1097680,1107120," so but we only have integers because we don't do anything with floats in here right uh we pass"
1109280,1116880," we pass the uh product of the current coordinate"
1116880,1121840," and the width the current coordinate and the width"
1121840,1128080," so essentially we're working with rational"
1129680,1138320," rational yeah rational fractions right so essentially here we probably need to accept nx and ny"
1138320,1147280," right nx and ny which is effectively the product of the size of the sprite and the um the coordinates"
1147280,1153600," right the current coordinate within this entire thing uh but i'm not kind of sure"
1156880,1164960," and then division w and h and this is basically the target width and height right so it is in fact a"
1164960,1173280," target width and height uh-huh so there we go uh now what do we have to do i think that is basically it"
1173280,1179120," and i should be able to just simply copy paste uh this entire thing all right"
1180400,1184000," i should be able to copy paste this entire thing and just put it in here"
1184000,1198560," so px py then this is that and this is that uh-huh and in here i simply gonna be returning this thing okay"
1198560,1206640," so uh let me see let me see so we are trying to build the demo and specifically we're trying to"
1206640,1212400," rebuild the demo squish right so and it doesn't rebuild properly because we yeah so instead of"
1212400,1216560," text uh we're using the word sprite maybe i should just call it sprite so i don't have to go"
1216560,1219520," through everything in here right"
1219520,1227600," okay and this one is rather interesting so we may end up with something that is"
1227600,1234320," um sort of outside of the texture right and we don't really check in here we sort of expect"
1234880,1241360," uh the color of this function to check for the out of bounds things so i'm not particularly sure"
1241360,1244800," how to go about this stuff in here right"
1244800,1250320," how to go about this stuff in here but we'll see"
1254960,1266720," so what do this does not check for out of bounds but maybe it shouldn't"
1266720,1279200," maybe it's a responsibility of the color of the function i'm just not sure for now right i'm simply"
1279200,1284000," not sure for now okay and the way we're going to use this function right the way we're going to use this"
1284000,1294960," function is just uh like this right we remove all of that so olivette uh bilinear where's the where's"
1294960,1300400," this so it was called pixel bilinear right so it's pixel bilinear we provide the texture we provide the"
1300400,1309520," sprite uh and x and y w and h and there we go so this thing automatically created bilinear interpolation"
1309520,1317520," uh and uh now we should be able to actually reuse uh this entire thing in uh triangle right so we should"
1317520,1325200," be able to reuse that in a triangle hopefully we'll see how it goes so n x and n y is basically a coordinate"
1325200,1334480," but multiplied by the width right multiplied by the width and width and height is a target"
1334480,1343440," target uh target width and width and target height which is rather interesting which is rather interesting"
1343440,1353200," but essentially we can just treat this as a thing by which you can divide all of that stuff"
1353920,1362640," yeah so you you basically pass like a fraction yeah you basically pass like a fraction uh in here"
1364240,1377360," but without opengl do you mean you're making your own software renderer yes"
1377360,1384640," that's precisely what i do uh you can find the demos of the thing that i'm doing in here"
1385280,1390400," uh and this is kind of the thing that we do this is not opengl this is actually rendered pixel by pixel"
1390400,1397840," on the cpu uh we even have a little bit of a 3d because um projecting 3d onto 2d screen is rather"
1397840,1404000," simple it's just a simple formula so you can do that uh we can do some you know texture transformations"
1404000,1412160," and stuff like that and we we can have this kind of stuff as well right so dating textures uh textured"
1412160,1417280," triangles as well in 3d space some models as you can see we have a model and we even have like a"
1417280,1425360," utility port uh so it's a little bit slow but again this is because it's on cpu and also on the laptop"
1425360,1433920," that i'm streaming from so i'm running all of that on the cpu on a 10 years old laptop plus obs that is"
1433920,1440160," currently streaming onto into the twitch so that's why it's a little bit slow uh so it's dropping some"
1440160,1444400," frames in here but when i'm not streaming it's actually rather fast and you can also check on"
1444400,1452720," on your machine right this is video or webgl this is not a video and this is not a webgl it's neither"
1452720,1461760," video nor a webgl it is rendered pixel by pixel on a cpu to sort of demonstrate that i can show you the"
1461760,1469840," the same demo but it's compiled for specifically for the terminal right so since it's rendered pixel by"
1469840,1475760," pixel into the memory we can take those pixel and we can display them anywhere for instance we can"
1475760,1483760," displace them in the in the terminal right so i can do t pot uh t pot 3d and terminal yeah there we go so"
1483760,1489600," this is the same demo this is absolutely the same code but it's rendered into the terminal right because we're"
1489600,1495760," rendering that into the memory so we can always take that piece of memory and just turn it into a"
1495760,1502080," terminal uh and see escape codes that add colors and stuff like that this is terminal right this is"
1502080,1508640," terminal right it just like refreshes all the time so i just do that in the terminal but it's the same code"
1508640,1514880," so the the code of the demos is extremely portable so you can compile it for as a native linux application or"
1514880,1519840," other as wasm it doesn't really care it doesn't really care in what environment to to execute and"
1519840,1526080," stuff like that we also have a native version right so where i can just use sdl uh in sdl it's a little"
1526080,1530400," bit faster right because it doesn't have to go through the browser and stuff like that this is a native"
1530400,1537520," application um right but this is sdl without using opengl or anything like that we're rendering that into the sdl"
1537520,1549520," texture uh since uh it's pixel by pixel i plan to use cmd or multi-threading later on yes i do plan in fact"
1549520,1557280," it's kind of it's kind of disappointing with uh modern compilers these days i was trying to look what can"
1557280,1563840," improve with cmd and i looked at some of the functions and a lot of them were automatically vectorized by the"
1563840,1574160," compiler so it's kind of like it would be kind of cool to like use cmd uh directly explicitly just to"
1574160,1580560," learn how to do that um but it's kind of like these days the compilers are so smart they just do that for"
1580560,1594080," you so all right so what we're working on right now we're working on a little bit of a bilinear"
1594080,1599440," interpolation because as you can see some of this stuff is a little bit pixelated right so we're"
1599440,1605040," trying to reduce the amount of pixelation uh and uh yeah that's what we're working on right now we're"
1605040,1610640," working on the bilinear interpolation we already have bilinear interpolation um i think we even have"
1610640,1617120," an example that demonstrates how it works yeah bilinear interpolation uh so expect there we go so"
1617120,1623200," we can even zoom in and you can see the difference between between them so this is no bilinear interpolation"
1623200,1630800," and this is bilinear interpolation so but this is only for aabb's right so we developed that only for aabb's"
1631360,1637040," access align boundary box that's what it stands for but now we're developing that for the triangles"
1637040,1642400," right because we can also have the rotating triangles and whatnot and they access the texture slightly"
1642400,1647280," differently so we are adapting existing code for for the triangles that's what we do"
1647280,1655120," okay um and bilinear interpolation is actually a rather cool technique um i really like that"
1656960,1668800," okay so uh uv so here is the function that does the thingy thingy imaging uh what i'm thinking is that"
1668800,1675840," how can we even do that how can we even do that well we can we kind of technically already do all of that"
1675840,1679920," uh right we kind of technically do all of that"
1683520,1687120," so what we need to do so here uh"
1687120,1700080," we can do something like this right we can kind of do something like this so texture uh we in texture you"
1700080,1702480," and"
1707200,1716000," we effectively end up we effectively end up with we effectively end up with um with the integer"
1716000,1726720," but this thing might be actually like very very small this thing might be"
1729360,1731280," um"
1731280,1743360," this is kind of cool so that means for these specific textures we'll have to turn this into a float"
1743360,1752000," huh that is very cool right so since we're already kind of working with the floats in here"
1752560,1761360," we have to continue working with the floats like that there we go so and if it's less than zero we can"
1761360,1770640," always bring it back to zero uh if this entire thing turns bigger than the width um right we might as"
1770640,1778480," well actually convert this into float yeah might as well convert this into float"
1778480,1785200," and just put that stuff in here why did it copy paste it twice i have no idea right copy paste it twice"
1785200,1790800," yeah there we go so we have a bunch of floats and all of that in floats but now"
1791360,1798800," we want to be able to do the bilinear interpolation right we want to be able to do olivet pixel bilinear"
1798800,1804160," we want to provide the texture but now we want to be able to provide the texture like this right"
1804160,1816080," but since this thing accepts only floats right since it's accept only floats we need to convert that into the"
1817200,1828880," fraction which is kind of like too much in my opinion of the how to say that of the conversion"
1828880,1832560," maybe we should create like a second version of this function that accepts the texture"
1832560,1837520," coordinates in floats instead of integers and fraction um"
1840880,1849520," olive edge pixel yes that's right um how do you install the software on linux you don't install"
1849520,1856160," the software on linux you develop it from scratch right on your machine right so that's that's the"
1856160,1864080," linux way of installing software you write it yourself from scratch on that specific machine and it works only"
1864080,1874400," on your machine how much bitcoin for python interpreter in haskell stream uh 1 000 bitcoins and i'll consider"
1874400,1881920," doing that but i can't uh you know can't promise a python interpreting in in in haskell it's kind of"
1881920,1889840," boring to be fair i suppose you just if you want to implement python interpreter you will just implement"
1889840,1896160," it in haskell the same way you implement it in any other language haskell is not that different of a"
1896160,1904880," language it's it pretends to be special it only pretends to be special and very academic and very high"
1904880,1910000," level and very elitist but when you start developing like an actually useful software in haskell"
1910800,1918320," it looks like a pretty shitty python honestly with with static typing it's just like it's it's a very"
1918320,1922400," boring language when it comes to like actual software development"
1922400,1929120," and you can only realize that by trying to do the actual software development and"
1929120,1933520," it's just like a lot of people instantly get disappointed in haskell it's just like oh it's just like"
1933520,1950320," okay um all right all right so let me let me see one of the things we can do one of the things we can do"
1950320,1956640," oh this is kind of cool believe it or not uh we have"
1958720,1965120," we have two coordinates right so imagine that we have a texture x and let's imagine that it has a"
1965120,1977440," value 69 420 and y uh has a value 23 42 right or maybe i don't know like 69 whatever uh right so the"
1977440,1987600," integer part shows you the specific pixel you're in right and the fractional part shows you uh shows you"
1987600,1994000," where exactly within the single pixel you are right it's a fractional part of the pixel right we have"
1994000,2002880," these float things but the bilinear thing uh accepts uh the fraction right it accepts instead of float it"
2002880,2010640," accepts the actual like rational fraction like a slash b um right how can we convert all of that there"
2011280,2018720," well we can pick a thing uh right which is going to be called precision right precision and let's say"
2018720,2026800," the precision is going to be 100 right so and then when we pass this thing into the bilinear interpolation"
2026800,2031920," we're going to multiply all of these things by 100 right and we're going to end up with values"
2033040,2042880," like this right and then we're going to pass the precision as the denominator into into the function"
2042880,2052240," and this is how we basically convert that into the rational rational fraction so essentially in here we can"
2052240,2059040," choose the level of precision we can go with right with aabbs since we already do everything in integers we"
2059040,2063200," can't really choose the precision it's whatever precision depending on the size of the target"
2063200,2068560," rectangle here we can actually pick a precision but it's still limited by the precision of the floating"
2068560,2074400," points so uh we'll have to keep in uh that in mind but apart from that it's it's spreading pretty"
2074400,2079040," straightforward okay so let's actually give it a try uh i'm going to literally just create precision"
2079040,2084640," right so this is going to be an integer uh right and when we're passing this thing in here i'm just"
2084640,2092000," multiplying that by the precision uh right precision is an integer texture is a float and then the argument"
2092000,2097840," is an integer again so it's going to convert it back uh and then we just pass the precision as the"
2097840,2105360," denominator and there you go so that should give us the expected result uh that should kind of give us"
2105360,2114160," the expected result and uh let me actually put it like that maybe i'm gonna i don't know uh let me"
2114160,2121680," put it in here so is that is that a good thing probably okay let's try to emacs uh let's try to rebuild"
2121680,2128560," the um the entire thing so it doesn't like what's going on in here uh did i accidentally remove the"
2128560,2134240," precision yeah i think i accidentally remove the precision it's kind of it's kind of strange but"
2134240,2143200," anyway okay cool so but i rebuild on this the squish i wanted to rebuild the texture 3d example"
2143200,2153040," right so where is that so it's a 3d tech right uh triangle uh triangle 3d tech right so let's rebuild"
2153040,2159360," that specifically um it seems to be compiling so far don't see any problems let's rebuild specifically sdl"
2159360,2165600," right because that's what we're going to be running in here and uh let me just go ahead"
2165600,2170320," and run this into i think triangle 3d tech sdl"
2170320,2179040," so what do we have all right do you guys see interpolation"
2183040,2188560," so yeah we can take a look at the original thing right we can take a look at the original thing"
2188560,2193200," what i'm going to do i'm going to just go to the build folder right i'm going to go to the build"
2193200,2201600," folder find the demo uh 3d tech so here is the sdl and i'm going to actually say uh bilinear right so"
2201600,2208560," this is the bilinear sdl and i'm going to disable that thing right i'm going to disable that thing"
2210880,2220080," so let me find the original code that we had so this is the original code and uh i'm gonna go in"
2220080,2227520," here so where is where is the file here it is here's the file right so we're gonna do something like if"
2227520,2238080," one uh else right and if and i'm gonna rebuild this thing one more time all right so it doesn't compile"
2238080,2244400," properly because why this thing is not an integer we can make it an integer not that big of a deal"
2244400,2254880," not that big of a deal let's make it an integer and then we go so this is what we had before right so"
2254880,2265520," this is what we had before and now what we have is uh triangle 3d tech bilinear uh there we go so this is"
2265520,2270960," what we have now right so this is what we have now right so this is what we had before right this is"
2270960,2276800," what we had before and this is what we have now so"
2276800,2286080," it's a little bit slower right because of the all the converges and stuff like that but we managed to"
2286080,2295520," actually convert uh you know the code that we use um to to do this thing it's kind of like this specific"
2295520,2302240," demo is kind of lame in my opinion right because it uses some sort of a texture but it's really unclear"
2302240,2314080," what its texture is all about and stuff like that maybe we should use like uh two textures in here maybe like actual textures from a 3d game like a texture of a wall"
2314080,2321680," over wall like a stone wall or cobblestone wall and another one uh a texture of like a wooden wall"
2321680,2328480," like wooden planks and whatnot and just like do the intersection between them to make it look good right"
2328480,2334480," or interesting uh because right now like what what the what the are we demoing in here like what's what's"
2334480,2339840," so special about this thing here it's kind of it's kind of lame don't you think it's kind of lame in my opinion"
2341120,2343600," all right so maybe we can work towards that"
2343600,2350400," uh maybe we can work towards that"
2350400,2362080," so does anyone have any on topic questions"
2364560,2370080," um probably not all right let's make a small break i want to make a cup of tea because i ran out of tea"
2370080,2376320," uh so um so i think i want to create two separate versions of this function the first one that"
2376320,2384240," doesn't use the bilinear interpolation and the second one that does use um doesn't use and does use okay"
2385200,2392160," so let me go ahead and just see uh three uv right so i'm gonna put this thing in here"
2392160,2401040," and this one is going to be bilinear right so this is bilinear triangle three uv"
2402400,2411840," so this one is already bilinear for sure right so it's already bilinear and then let me make this the"
2411840,2419920," main stuff and another version the one that does use uh and the one that doesn't use the bilinear"
2419920,2427360," interpolation right it's a little bit of a copy paste code but again it's needed to actually then later"
2427360,2434240," notice the patterns to to reduce them and stuff like that right so it's totally fine to duplicate code"
2434240,2442000," right i use that as a way to gather information of what's needed and what's not needed so"
2442000,2445680," that's basically how i do that"
2445680,2455280," so this one okay so this one becomes integer this is an integer uh and then i'm gonna move this thing to"
2455280,2468640," here it's because size t because size team and uh size team uh all right so maybe i'm gonna actually"
2468640,2476960," separate these things so something does not particularly work uh because if i go to semicolon that's fine"
2476960,2481360," it's totally fine that's precisely what the compiler is all about"
2484320,2491200," so we now we're using the version without the bilinear interpolation"
2491200,2499120," uh let me find 3d did i already close that demo i feel like i already closed it i need to have it open"
2499120,2506640," somewhere here uh to the two so 3d texture where is 3d uv"
2509360,2520080," 3d 3d uv bilinear"
2520080,2527440," all right okay so in here we have the bilinear interpolation yeah there we go so this is two"
2527440,2538320," separate function but there is another demo uh that uses textures uh it's called triangle text but it doesn't"
2538320,2542160," use use these specific functions as far as i know this is one of those demos that"
2542160,2550720," uh iterate the pixels of the triangle directly without any olivet's functions yeah there we go so this is"
2550720,2558480," what we have in here yeah and the way this thing works if i remember correctly triangle tech"
2561440,2569680," yeah we directly iterate oh no look at that no we're still using this thing it's just like oh we just"
2569680,2578720," set z to one to basically indicate that we don't have any distortion like 3d distortion okay so that's"
2578720,2585120," actually kind of funny okay so this is bilinear and if i i can just like straight up enable bilinear"
2585120,2592000," interpolation here and it will and it's interpolated yeah so okay that's that's pretty cool uh it's"
2592000,2598000," straight up interpolated so let's actually rebuild all of the demos uh right and see how they look like in"
2598000,2610560," um in the in wasm right so triangle uh 3d so i think i want to enable like bilinear interpolation for all of the"
2610560,2615520," demos right uh i think it's going to be a good idea i think it's going to be a good idea"
2615520,2625680," so demos uh let me see so dots model squish here we use bilinear which is fine uh triangle 3d"
2625680,2635200," triangle 3d texture so uv uses bilinear uh 3 uv yeah there we go 3 uv so triangle doesn't use any texture"
2635200,2641360," triangle texture we okay so all of them are already using bilinear so let me remove the build folder just"
2641360,2647120," to build everything from scratch and let's just go ahead and like literally rebuild everything okay"
2655040,2665200," so how's it going so i'm just waiting until it builds"
2665200,2673120," i still using french press for tea now i'm actually brewing tea in"
2675440,2676720," just in the cup actually"
2676720,2686080," thanks for object on streams you're welcome uh thanks to whoever suggested the topic i forgot their"
2686080,2696080," name unfortunately um right um okay so we rebuild everything and let me just run this into i think"
2696080,2702480," obviously with bilinear interpolation it's a little bit slower but i'm gonna address that later all right"
2703600,2711760," there we go okay so here we have that and here is this thing with bilinear interpolation okay it"
2711760,2718560," actually looks much nicer i really like how it looks like okay and oh my god this is actually so cool i"
2718560,2719120," really like that"
2724320,2736240," so okay uh speaking of the like different textures in here right so um open game art something something"
2736240,2740480," uh i think that's the website where we can have public domain textures uh thank you so much"
2740480,2747520," buffer to zero zero 14 for which prime thank you thank you thank you is it much slower look slower easy"
2747520,2760000," it's i don't think it's much but it is slower uh how to tell actually uh anyway so cobblestone"
2760000,2764320," okay stone"
2764320,2776320," mm-hmm oh this this looks nice i really like this one uh is it public domain it's cc by okay so can we find uh"
2776320,2780080," uh purely public domain i'm interested in purely public domain i'm interested in purely public domain"
2780080,2788000," because i'm narcissistic prick and doesn't want to credit anyone it's not because of that right so"
2788000,2795360," because it's just like uh wanna make myself as little amount of work as possible uh okay"
2797680,2801760," maybe something with attribution maybe something with attribution oh this one looks nice"
2801760,2809280," uh okay oh this looks cool it's like magma stuff"
2809280,2814320," you you you okay so can i download"
2814320,2817360," uh-huh so"
2817360,2821120," um credits"
2823360,2829840," so i'm still gonna like put that in the credits just to like uh have a have a link"
2829840,2833440," when if i need to go back uh all right so"
2833440,2838480," i'm just wondering which"
2838480,2846480," i forgot how to use computer okay uh it's so inconvenient why can't i just save it in here"
2847680,2854880," so i can't save it in here so i have to kind of click on these files and it's not clear for me"
2854880,2861200," which files is which it's so weird such a weird system wait a second uh i want specifically this thing"
2862000,2863120," and okay"
2863120,2869360," it's so bad oh my god okay i'm sorry um"
2869360,2884720," so old stone so generally in terms of ui when i see something i want to click on it and i want to"
2884720,2891360," download exactly that like with this kind of system where by seeing this thing i cannot click on it and"
2891360,2897120," download it it's kind of difficult for me to understand like what name corresponds to what"
2897120,2901600," luckily they have the third thing in here where i can click but it's just like generally very"
2901600,2905040," confusing i'm sorry for ranting about that but it's just like a very confusing thing"
2905040,2914800," oh i'm sorry um okay so let me copy paste it in here and it's actually kind of huge uh if we take a"
2914800,2924400," look at the this thing right it's thousand my god i definitely need to convert this entire thing so old"
2924400,2935520," stone um let's resize this entire thing to something like 120 right uh so old stone old stone 120"
2935520,2943200," uh all right so that looks a little bit better i think right and it's actually much smaller but it's not that"
2943200,2949600," small compared to the rest of this thing but anyway so one of the things i want to do i want to basically"
2949600,2960480," build this asset into a c file so i can bake that asset into my demos right so uh old stone"
2961840,2970720," to 120 right so it was old stone right assets yeah let me actually keep it like this and this is assets"
2970720,2981200," old stone there we go so now i can do no build assets right let's take a look so the old stone has been"
2981200,2987040," built here it is and if we take a look at this entire thing here this here are the pixels of this specific"
2987040,2990880," image so we can bake that image into the demo right so we can bake that image into the demo right so now"
2990880,2999440," i'm going to go to one of my demos right in here uh demos uh 3d texture right so this is a 3d texture"
2999440,3007360," and we're using sodding pogue as the texture right so let's actually replace uh create place sodding"
3007360,3017760," a pug with old stone uh old stone and see how it's gonna go uh maybe you know what i think in no build"
3017760,3024640," i should actually call this thing just old stone c not 120 right because i just don't want to have like"
3024640,3031680," dash in the name so i don't think it's particularly great to have that anyway okay so uh now let's rebuild a"
3031680,3039840," specific demo which is triangle 3d texture right so and it doesn't really work properly because why"
3039840,3047760," oh yeah because in the original demo the name of the variables it does not is not exactly what i think it"
3047760,3054640," is yeah oh it's still you it's still using word sodding cup because i copy pasted the code okay so that's"
3054640,3062160," fine uh so essentially what i have to put in here i have to put old stone there we go so hopefully if"
3062160,3067840," we rebuild the assets so let's first rebuild the assets okay the assets has been rebuilt let's rebuild the"
3067840,3074320," demo and the demo seems to be built correctly well it's not finished but it's already a good progress"
3074320,3082960," right and let's just try to run this entire thing demos triangle 3d texture sdl and that's what we have in"
3082960,3089920," here it's kind of weird all right it's kind of weird it's kind of like yeah it is definitely weird"
3089920,3099360," but i suppose this is because of the uv coordinates right so we probably need to fix the uv coordinates"
3099360,3107760," uh let's actually give it a try um that's pretty cool so let's actually do uh the second thing uh what's"
3107760,3117360," gonna be the second texture in here um all right so cobblestone wooden right so let's take a look at"
3117360,3126880," wooden planks uh so this is uh see oh well this looks all right i think i can use that um"
3128000,3144480," wooden crate though i would probably go for something a bit more realistic if you know what i mean"
3144480,3150320," this doesn't really look right what about this one"
3153040,3156960," it's too huge it's too huge i don't want to spend time cropping it would be nice to have something"
3156960,3174160," that i can just download and just copy paste into into my stuff"
3174160,3183680," um"
3183680,3192560," don't like any of this okay so maybe let's just use uh another stone but with a different color"
3192560,3200960," like this one for the contrast oh okay so let's download this then this one uh lava stone okay"
3201680,3210160," so let's give it a try i'm gonna go to the downloads uh lava stone where is the lava stone"
3210160,3216560," lava stone there we go so let's put that in the into the assets and let's also resize this thing"
3216560,3228800," so let me let me let me see so probably have to do convert right so let's do convert convert please"
3229600,3241360," resize 120 lava stone lava stone lava stone there we go so we have that and no built uh let's query please"
3241360,3248240," uh old stone with lava stone there we go uh-huh"
3248240,3257600," and no built assets there we go so it seems to be it build everything okay that's cool"
3258640,3267440," um now in 3d tech right so we're also going to include lava stone right you can see both of the"
3267440,3278160," assets are included in here uh all right and let's also do it like that so now we have old stone and lava"
3278160,3288160," stone cool you know i think we really need to fix the uv coordinates but i forgot where we put uv coordinates"
3288160,3293040," that's actually"
3293040,3302080," so this is a triangle z uh i suppose these are the uv coordinates they're kind of they're kind of lame"
3302080,3308640," so this is the triangle this is uv um so if i remember correctly p1"
3310240,3324000," that's the triangle is oh man i don't remember um zero seven so in terms of z this is just z"
3324000,3333920," all right z plus okay that's fine one leg this is another leg and"
3335920,3345760," two minus i suppose you can think of this thing as the left leg and this is the right leg and they're"
3345760,3355360," all both at the bottom and this is the top okay so that makes sense uh we can work from here"
3356880,3362880," right we can work from here if this is the left leg that means it's a zero one"
3363920,3371120," uh-huh oh that's why it is okay so they're precisely what i wanted but they're they were just"
3371120,3376720," swapped i see so that actually explains why it was sort of like uh weird but yeah"
3378880,3384800," uh no build is a python script no it's actually c program uh all right it's literally a c program"
3384800,3395200," i'm building c with c yes building c with c it's actually kind of cool believe it or not"
3397760,3404720," it's a it's a it's a very interesting idea uh very innovative idea that i came up with like two or"
3404720,3410800," three years ago for how long how long time ago i came up with it but anyway um"
3410800,3420320," so i suppose yeah like two years ago yeah i came up with that but two years ago so people usually build"
3420320,3429200," c project c projects with like shell scripts make cmake usually some other tool right some other tool"
3429200,3436240," which is kind of weird right we're building c project project written in c why is it not enough"
3436240,3444240," to have a c compiler to build an entire c project in my opinion there should be only c compiler that"
3444240,3449280," builds the entire you know c project and this is what it's all about right so"
3449920,3454160," you have a c program that builds the rest of the project the first thing you have to do you have to"
3454160,3461680," bootstrap it uh right so you have to build your no build script like so you first bootstrap it and"
3461680,3469920," then you run your no build script and it builds rest of the things and you don't need make shell cmake"
3469920,3475920," any other things like you the only thing you need is c compiler c compiler first compiles the code that"
3475920,3479520," will build the rest of the things and you can actually bootstrap that in"
3479520,3484640," several stages who said that the program that you bootstrap doesn't build more code that builds even"
3484640,3490080," more code and builds even more code you have a c compiler and c compiler is a c language is doing"
3490080,3494400," complete language and it can interact with the operating system and can do actually more than"
3494400,3498640," any of the python scripts and stuff like that it's just like nobody's doing that"
3498640,3501920," and i'm doing it"
3504160,3509680," all right as you can see i just rebuild the entire project with c c code so all of that is printed by"
3509680,3517040," c code right c code just runs other other click compilers and stuff like that anyway so let me actually"
3517040,3525440," see uh so it complained that i don't use old stone oh it complains that i use don't use lava stone okay"
3525440,3530640," so let me run demo triangle 3d texture and uh"
3530640,3536560," oh this is but this is actually kind of cool at the same time look at that"
3541840,3550240," yeah it's probably something with the z axis all right something with the z axis"
3550240,3555120," oh i think i know what the is going on"
3555120,3566320," i still need to keep this thing what i just have to do is but replace three back into two"
3566960,3574480," and two back into three something that i think that's what needs to be done here so let's rebuild"
3574480,3587760," uh the demos uh triangle 3d tech uh sdl okay cool all right and then build demos triangle"
3589360,3601760," back is it working it's kind of working but it's still up it's still kind of stretched but maybe it's"
3601760,3611200," not if i bring back sodium pog right so maybe this is something with the old stone itself that kind of"
3612640,3621040," does it does that it's sodium pog uh old old stone where is the old stone and let's just keep it like"
3621040,3626000," that stone sodium pog there we go"
3626000,3634080," uh it's kind of cool that i can actually swap these things i can say okay use sodium pog now let's see"
3634080,3641840," does it make sense it kind of makes oh yeah it because it's kind of on the side"
3642640,3650160," yeah but i guess i guess that's fine all right so this is the old stone and let's take a look at"
3650160,3654640," this second triangle in here right so we're doing the second triangle"
3657200,3662320," yeah isn't it is not pogue isn't that pogue i think it's freaking pogue"
3662320,3674240," so i suppose what i want to do in here is just this all right i'm gonna put it in here"
3674240,3681200," so but we have to do oc2 we're rendering that to the second"
3682480,3686880," thing in here i'll definitely need to clean it up but yeah it's a lava stone"
3686880,3701600," okay that's cool does it look like a cool demo it looks like to be fair"
3705440,3711920," i wonder why i wonder why so let's actually rebuild uh everything"
3711920,3713120," all right"
3713120,3720400," so we have unused texture"
3720400,3722560," unused texture"
3722560,3727440," well i'm gonna keep it for now because it's for testing purposes anyway"
3728480,3738240," uh uh yep yep yep with item textures here they are so this is in the in the web browser"
3738240,3745440," it kind of looks cool i wish i could fix the distortion of the texture"
3745440,3754000," but i don't quite understand what causes it don't quite understand what causes it"
3756240,3764000," because the coordinates all right the coordinates that we use so zero one"
3764000,3781040," so zero one is that one and then oh this one is i think this thing has to be one one"
3782480,3791440," yeah because it's of course obviously obviously it's not like that okay so let's actually start with"
3791440,3799360," this uh the old stone right so let's try to fix that with the old stone uh triangle 3d tech"
3799360,3805200," build demos why did you go there oh because i'm here"
3807120,3814480," okay cool so i think it will fix the gesture hopefully yo look at that perfect perfect texture"
3814480,3823440," i was right i just up uv coordinates my gut but we fixed only old stone we didn't fix the lava stone"
3823440,3829120," so i'm sure you fix the lava stone and it's just as simple as replacing zero with one in single place"
3829120,3838960," it's one character bug the freaking classic freaking classic look at that beauty look at that mother flipping beauty"
3838960,3847920," you know what i kind of want to like increase the resolution because it's kind of too"
3849680,3859040," too blurry for my taste yeah kind of too blurry for my taste and all that is not open gl so that's what"
3859040,3868800," makes it cool it's not open gl holy it's just like it's pixel by pixel from freaking scratch so cool and"
3868800,3877600," because of that uh we can actually uh run all of that stuff in the terminal so let's actually see how"
3877600,3885280," it looks like in the terminal right i'm really curious uh okay so and then uh we can do triangle"
3885280,3894400," uh triangle 3d texture terminal right well i mean yeah okay so what did i expect it's just interpolated"
3894400,3905360," some colors and stuff but it it tried it it kind of yeah we can maybe we should increase the uh resolution"
3905360,3914240," specifically for the terminal all right so remember that for the teapot we just had to set the scaling a"
3914240,3919280," little bit higher uh all right so let's actually set the scaling a little bit higher so the texture"
3919280,3924960," becomes a little bit more visible um no gel trend let's go exactly"
3924960,3934560," damn look at that i was just it's having a little bit of a hiccup but overall"
3934560,3942480," it's kind of cool it's a terminal right ask your stuff basically"
3949280,3956240," uh where do i start if i want to become a master programmer like you keep in mind that i have a 17"
3956240,3967760," years of software development basically 16 17 i don't remember precisely but are you ready to take"
3968320,3973840," that path do you have enough patience to walk that path"
3973840,3984880," here's the thing it's not about the destination it's literally about the journey really"
3990160,3994400," right because if you make it because if you make it about the destination you will run out of patience"
3994400,3997840," very quickly because there is no destination"
3997840,4010000," have you ever qualified qualified for i see i see my cpc i have seen you wearing yeah yeah so i've been on"
4010000,4020080," uh semifinals for for my region north east something near i forgot what it is i see i'm a cpc"
4020080,4029280," what was that north eurasia con yes north eurasian semifinals but i've never been in the finals only semifinals"
4033760,4040000," i'm not really that good at competitive programming because i get stressed out really easily and uh"
4040000,4046480," yeah i can't focus so i can solve pretty hard competitive program problems but only when there"
4046480,4054480," is no pressure on me in terms of time or whatever right so usually if i just sit down in a comfortable"
4054480,4061120," environment i can pretty much solve it but because i'm easily stressed out under the time limitations i was"
4061120,4066720," never good at actual competitive programming so what's interesting is that competitive programming"
4066720,4072560," is really not about like how good of a programmer you are it's more about the stress management at"
4072560,4080160," least for me right really better stress management why there are white edges around the purple uh trees"
4080160,4082080," uh i have no idea honestly"
4082080,4089360," i was just avoiding that problem thinking that maybe it will go away but it didn't go away"
4091120,4105840," uh we don't really see them in here right uh it could be because of how we oh yeah i know"
4105840,4116240," okay so the way we resize uh the um the frame before putting it in the terminal we actually resize it by chunks"
4116240,4124320," right so we take a chunk of how many like 32 by 32 pixels or it depends on resolution we just take a"
4124320,4132640," small chunk and we compute the average color for that chunk and that color becomes the core of one uh"
4132640,4139760," character in here so one character is a cluster of uh pixels and the color of that character is the"
4139760,4144320," average of those things so this is how we resize specifically for the terminal demo and if the"
4144320,4151360," cluster is on the edge it computes an average of these colors and these scores and these colors become"
4151360,4158400," more like diluted with whatever we have in here this is my best explanation you can come up with i think"
4158960,4165840," this is roughly how it works but maybe i'm wrong but i'm just too lazy to go into exploring like why"
4165840,4173280," it's like that so something something i'm wrong yeah i should have not closed"
4181280,4189200," we'll make doom in terminal i don't know i'd rather create my own game"
4189200,4206960," here's an interesting thing like somebody makes a doom or let's say tetris right"
4208960,4214640," and everyone is super impressed about that but what does it mean to make"
4214640,4220080," tetris when tetris was not a thing"
4220080,4222640," you know what i mean"
4222640,4231760," so it is easy to make a game when the concept is already developed for you you know what i mean"
4231760,4237600," so the concept of tetris for instance is already well developed you only need to take this concept and"
4237600,4244080," implement it but what does it mean to make a concept as cool as tetris or make a game as cool as doom"
4244080,4249040," that's for me personally that's what's actually interesting you know what i mean"
4249040,4257840," make a doom i mean doom is already made there's nothing interesting in making them"
4261360,4264720," not sure if it's not sure if it makes sense it's just it's a very subtle difference right"
4264720,4277040," what i wanted to do yeah i wanted to increase the resolution i wanted to slightly increase the"
4277040,4289040," resolution with those things um so you know i'm gonna call this thing origin and this thing or origin"
4291360,4298800," i'm gonna do it i'll just get rid of this stuff and then build"
4307280,4313440," cp is a competitive program uh i'm confused whether i should focus more on cp or development"
4313440,4321040," focus on both the both fun actually but just keep in mind that they're basically different activities"
4332240,4338400," okay so maybe i should actually rebuild everything just thinking"
4338400,4342400," let's rebuild everything"
4342400,4355840," to be fair i mean i think in the future competitive programming is going to be dead because of the gpt models"
4357680,4363200," because look look look look look codeforces.com"
4363200,4373760," where is https mike mike mirzaian what the anyway uh so"
4373760,4383120," so this is a huge uh base um of problems of competitive programming problems right"
4385440,4390160," so there's like thousands of them and look you can click here"
4390160,4396640," right here are submissions people we are trying to solve these problems you can click here"
4396640,4402960," you can click here okay can you click here"
4402960,4413520," but i think hey this is because something is something's wrong but essentially if you log in at least"
4414400,4418400," uh there should be a solution in here so we can actually take solutions solutions are open"
4418400,4422480," take this entire and feed it into the gpt model"
4422480,4429120," and see what's gonna happen i'm pretty sure they're gonna basically kill competitive programming as an"
4429120,4436240," activity the same way as like alpha go killed go or something like that so"
4437280,4444800," yeah yeah so you have a huge database of things to feed into the language model uh and the competitive"
4444800,4451280," program problems are like very well defined um that it's i think relatively easy to make a"
4451280,4456480," you know a model that can just like you know crank them very easily"
4460000,4472080," okay so let's continue what i wanted to do is increase the resolution of my textures"
4472080,4480800," right so they are 120 let's actually do 200 right so i'm going to convert uh old stone"
4481680,4489200," uh origin png and then old stone png and then just resize it to 200"
4489200,4499920," right but it was lava stone what is going on compilation process is running why is it running"
4501040,4511600," okay uh low stone i want to see the file it didn't work even though oh because i did old stone okay so"
4511600,4519120," let me take a look this is uh okay so that's a bit better and let's do the same for lava stone"
4520880,4530080," lava stone okay so if i could look at that seems good uh huh and i'm gonna do another no build thing"
4530080,4535760," have you ever worked in game development company in korea no never worked in game development"
4535760,4541280," uh all right so let's continue"
4541280,4548560," uh what i wanted to do i wanted to just refresh this entire thing does it look better i think it"
4548560,4554160," looks better so it has more um yeah more details i really like how it looks like"
4554160,4568560," why not because i value my health physical and mental do you know what it means to work in game"
4568560,4577680," development especially close to the deadline do you do you know what it means i just no i'm not"
4577680,4581680," participating in that bullshit okay so uh triangle"
4581680,4586240," okay"
4586240,4600080," i really like how it looks like it's kind of cool so the background color could be"
4600080,4606480," uh could be a little bit bright i think we have a background so i think it's olivettes"
4607360,4615520," feel uh let's actually make it just a tiny bit brighter like 2020 and uh let's just go build"
4615520,4632320," okay that looks much better look at that look at that and this is not open jail even though nobody gives a"
4632320,4645920," right"
4645920,4654240," i can understand how game developers have so much passion to justify so much exploitation that's a good"
4654240,4660800," question i don't know i would probably say that maybe it's because it's a young developers right so"
4661440,4668240," but look at john blow he's like 50 and he's still working his ass off that's how passionate he is"
4668240,4674160," about game development it's just like it's not about the age even it's just like it's like"
4674160,4680560," it's like it's a pure passion i i just like don't have that much of a passion towards game development"
4680560,4689920," right it's an interesting problem to solve but yeah um it's 50 52 i think right something something like 52"
4689920,4696000," uh some people maybe enjoy creating games and they don't mind oh yeah maybe that's basically"
4696000,4701200," continuation of me not being able to work under pressure right because i'm was never a good"
4701200,4706240," competitive programmer because it's too much stress and for the same reason i don't like a stressful job"
4706240,4711440," all right so that's probably why i don't work in the game development even though i might have all of"
4711440,4716720," the necessary skills uh technical skills to work in the in the game development i lack"
4716720,4723920," i think what's what's the pretentious word people use to describe that soft skills right i forgot soft"
4723920,4731520," skills i don't have soft skills to work there right so that's that's that's the word anyway um so and"
4731520,4738240," it's not even skills i think it's not even skills it's more of a biological thing right so i'm biologically not"
4738240,4745280," built to work under huge stress um i think because i tried i tried a lot i worked at different works and"
4745280,4752880," it's just like yeah if i'm under pressure i just like can't do that no that i'd rather be poor"
4753920,4761520," my entire life right live in a ditch but if there is no pressure on me i'm i'm gonna be happy"
4761520,4770800," some interested people can't work because there is maths oh no not because there is maths because they"
4770800,4777600," think there is maths if you take those people who say that they're scared of math and you show them"
4777600,4784960," something interesting but you don't tell them that this is maths they won't be scared of that so the"
4784960,4794240," the fear of maths is actually artificial that is imposed by education system right the modern education"
4794240,4802960," system basically presents maths as a ton of pointless rules to remember to solve problems that you're never"
4802960,4809280," gonna have in the in your entire life this is how modern education presents mathematics this is how"
4809280,4817440," it presented and of course if you study that for several years you're gonna be so sick of it you will"
4817440,4823440," be like literally avoiding that your entire life if you if this is what you think is math which in reality"
4823440,4829440," it is not mathematics is not about that completely but it's already too late like right so educational"
4829440,4836880," system basically traumatizes people uh and this is actually kind of dangerous for the humanity and i know"
4836880,4841680," that it sounds pretentious but it is dangerous for humanity because we have educational system that"
4841680,4846560," produces people who don't want to do math and we are heavily dependent on people who do math"
4848720,4855520," right that is actually dangerous if you think about it right so imagine the entire system"
4855520,4860480," our entire infrastructure is dependent on people who understand math but our educational system produces"
4860480,4869520," people who are afraid of math that is dangerous uh all right anyway"
4872640,4877200," so uh what i wanted to do i'm gonna actually commit all of that um"
4877200,4881040," oh writing"
4881040,4889200," so i'm thinking about the commit message right so what i'm gonna put here as a commit message"
4890400,4902560," uh i think i know port by linear interpolation to triangle functions right the triangle functions"
4902560,4906880," and let me rebuild everything one more time just in case"
4906880,4917840," okay no build build everything but what's interesting is that majority of people probably"
4919680,4926400," not gonna use math anyway at least the math that is given to to people right"
4926400,4930640," so when was the last time you needed like uh integral"
4930640,4941360," anyway so we can talk about this forever let me actually run the tests"
4944240,4946400," uh it's a single test"
4946400,4946400," uh it's a single test"
4946400,4952160," all right so everything seems to be working and let's do the update"
4952160,4958320," uh wasm binaries it wasn't binaries and it's actually pushed that right"
4958320,4964480," okay i really like how the texture thingy looks like it's so cool"
4966240,4975760," though now it looks lame because the background is actually okay so let me bring the background back"
4975760,4985040," let me bring the background back so it was a demo text 3d text"
4986560,4990160," 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 18. boom"
4990160,4994160," let's rebuild"
4994160,5002800," nothing i go to work every day thankful that i know the definition of derivative"
5002800,5006880," definition of derivative by the way is really cool"
5009520,5011360," it's kind of like non-intuitive"
5011360,5020240," right it's just like you basically start to explore right what is going to happen if you start"
5020240,5026160," narrowing right the the value of the function and the input of the function divided by each other"
5026160,5032480," and you would expect that it will arrive nowhere but it actually arrives somewhere analytically and"
5032480,5038800," it's just like what what the how did that happen and it's rather interesting and it's actually kind of"
5038800,5043360," makes sense and has a huge application um so yeah"
5043360,5050080," all right that's good"
5050080,5061200," bring back old triangle triangle 3d tech background"
5061200,5064800," and let's push that right to the repo"
5064800,5075920," yo that is cool that is very very cool"
