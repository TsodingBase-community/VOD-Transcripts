0,3000," okay"
3000,14880," surprisingly enough i cannot hear shit and"
14880,19920," is that because can you hear me by the way"
19920,26480," okay there we go so there's something wrong with them"
30000,47280," the music is still sort of lagging i'm not sure if we can hear it but it's just lagging a little bit"
47280,49840," at least for me"
49840,57520," maybe just needs i don't know what the is going on with me can you hear that the music lagging or is"
57520,62080," it only me could you hear at least because i actually stopped it"
62080,68240," okay whatever"
68240,76960," uh so here's an interesting thing uh here is an interesting thing"
76960,80480," so"
83120,86960," i forgot the name of the project that i had to go to it's it's called a tomato"
86960,92160," so let's take a look at what killed my entire fucking machine"
92160,94160," um"
103600,111280," i don't see the square this killed my entire machine i have no idea how"
111280,115680," this killed my entire machine"
118000,120240," okay okay sure it's an infinite loop"
120240,127200," uh-huh this is probably"
127200,133040," yeah i think i kind of know how that could killed my machine if sdl"
133040,138640," is the music too annoying please tell me i need the feedback because i don't know what's going on"
138640,141520," is the music too annoying can i just uh leave it in"
141520,149040," it is lagging like crazy uh everything is goddamn broken on my machine"
149680,160000," um all right so i'm gonna i'm gonna turn all the music then like uh holy shit um"
161760,169920," oh"
169920,183120," if it uses some sort of like a bachelor and batch batch renderer right if it uses some sort of a batch"
183120,189760," renderer uh it probably maintains the list of the things that it needs to render on the next frame"
189760,196880," right so it probably doesn't render things right away it renders them later right and if you start"
196880,204640," so to do that it probably maintains a list of the things right so basically you uh draw a line"
204640,209440," but what it in fact does it just uh you know schedules to draw a line and put it into list of"
209440,215680," lines to render and then probably it uh creates a shader with all the lines available and draws that in"
215680,222560," a shader so at least this is how i would do that right uh this is how i would do that uh and if you"
222560,228960," start like pushing these lines in a loop right so that means that could consume all of the memory"
228960,235840," starts consuming all of the memory if this uh if this thing doesn't have any sort of limit right and"
235840,242320," that could potentially kill the entire machine you see what i mean so that could be an explanation so"
242320,248800," by itself this thing doesn't really do anything uh by itself it doesn't really do anything but"
248800,256480," if the sdl works the way i think it works and i think it actually does work this way it may"
256480,259840," basically consume everything it just depends on how it schedules everything"
259840,263360," wakaflame thank you thank you so much for the gifted sub thank you thank you"
263920,268080," uh all right so let's actually take a look at the source code of sdl because this is actually very"
268080,279520," interesting um oh just to give me time to to find motivation to to keep doing that because it's"
279520,286800," kind of goddamn hard uh to keep yourself motivated when uh nothing is working and uh chat is actually"
286800,296560," tries to you know you know the fuck out of you right uh so okay let me see um so let's find the"
296560,307120," implementation of this function all right uh and here it is so it uses this function like render draw lines f"
307920,315840," uh uh uh and let's actually try to go there right so it's going to be something like grep rn uh where"
315840,322960," it is so this is just an external declaration um right it's just an external declaration and where"
322960,327840," is the actual implementation i feel like the actual implementation could depend on the driver"
328640,336640," it could depend on the driver but looks like here it is uh so render lines"
336640,348640," uh uh cue cmd draw lines this could be the case as you can see it cues drawing lines"
348640,355600," well so it's already you know kind of works the way i described right and even though like i never read"
355600,360320," like properly sdl i don't really know how that renders things but i could imagine that that this"
360320,367600," is how it does that at least this is how i would implement that personally uh right so prepare a qcmd draw"
367600,376320," solid so it prepares some sort of a queue then q draw lines and okay this is interesting so it uses like an"
376320,381280," internal method of renderer right it uses the internal method of renderer and"
383200,390320," that thing is very much driver dependent right so in opengl it probably does one thing in direct"
390320,396080," 3d does another one and so on and so forth right so let's actually take a look at what we have here"
396080,403280," uh so let's try to specifically search for this one and yeah as you can see we're starting to see"
403280,409440," different uh drivers we just see different drivers in here and let's take a look at the opengl one because"
409440,417040," that's the one that we use all the time and what does it do here um so q draw lines"
417040,428240," yeah so it's a gl version sdl allocate rendering vertices so we're allocating some stuff uh and then"
430640,436480," yeah i think the most important thing is probably here so it keeps allocating the memory so let's try"
436480,442560," to find this uh function then so i think this is the unless i miss something unless i miss something"
442560,447120," i think i didn't miss anything because we're just allocating it and probably like it's it in some sort"
447120,454240," of a allocator or whatnot and yeah so okay let's take a look at that one uh so it's going to be like this"
455680,464000," uh right and where it is implemented so i suppose yeah it sounds like it's something very much"
464000,470960," driver dependent but not really so it's using this function everywhere uh and this could be the"
470960,483360," implementation implementation well there we go there we go so"
483360,492080," interesting every time you draw something you potentially reallocate memory"
493520,501760," using sdl so this code is executed this entire function is executed every time you call"
501760,507840," uh draw line and it potentially reallocates memory with its own allocator"
507840,517040," let that sink in right every time you draw a line it potentially may start reallocating the memory right"
517040,525280," and if you start drawing lines in a loop the memory is growing it keeps reallocating it"
525280,533040," and god knows how many times it will start reallocating if it goes into an infinite loop and at some"
533040,542080," point it may execute that thing but since we're like on x86 64 with virtual memory and swap uh it like"
542080,548720," virtually has no limits for the memory so maybe now this thing will never be called and that will just"
548720,553680," basically consume errors everything from from my from my system i think it explains everything"
553680,559360," sdl is just a piece of that's the explanation um interesting"
559360,565520," if you're not careful it just kills your entire system thank you sdl very cool"
565520,569760," you could have implemented that a little bit better i suppose um"
569760,578320," maybe some sort of like a limit i don't know because there's a limit to how much you can render anyway"
578320,585120," it's okay it's kind of shitty library if you think about it like if it's organized like that it's kind of"
585120,589920," kind of mad right could have been actually implemented way better"
591440,599040," i like it but yeah that's essentially what killed my stream and uh the the world is split and everything"
599040,605200," um but it was educational i suppose it was kind of educational"
613360,619840," which can be older but i mean whatever i said i didn't propose as a final solution what i said is"
619840,625840," that you could have done it better and like it doesn't matter what exactly i said that what i said"
625840,633760," is that you could have done it better uh specific may vary it just needs to be like you know a little"
633760,639120," bit in actual research can you forgot i didn't have time to maintain the forks of sdl"
639120,648960," i have too many of my own projects to maintain some of those projects no"
648960,654560," the only thing i can do is complain about state of the world all right"
657280,664400," uh so let's continue let me let me see if the music became better uh i don't know if it became better"
664400,672240," something wrong with pulse pulse audio uh after the restart maybe the caches has been warmed up a little"
672240,684880," bit uh let me see let me see so it does not lag anymore at least it still lags and i don't know why"
686880,687200," uh"
687200,696160," like from time to time uh and it's really difficult for me to know why"
696160,709200," so what's funny is that this specific lagging is attributed to i think chromium itself because"
709200,716480," i only experienced it in chromium and nowhere else which is kind of interesting so"
716480,724080," vlc works usually fine mplayer mvc i think it's called mvc but yeah it's usually like this kind"
724080,729680," of lagging sometimes happens to me uh out like off screen and it's only in chromium it's only in"
729680,737200," chromium but i never tried firefox so never tried firefox uh also i think my system is dying yet again"
738160,742560," and everything is super slow right now um even though i restarted the machine"
742560,745680," but yeah"
753440,754320," what is this what is this shit"
754320,762400," oh it's it's one of the things that they're open for wire world what a show stream am i right"
762400,768480," uh what a show stream so maybe i'm gonna make a cup of tea does anyone have any questions"
773200,783920," um while i'm making a cup of tea"
783920,791440," mcq8 thank you so much for six months of tier one subscription thank you thank you thank you"
792800,802400," and welcome to our epic sdl don't worry now i know not to use sdl and i guess but it's not like you"
802400,808240," have too much choice unless you want to implement everything from scratch uh which is also a valid"
808240,814000," option for example this is something that john blow would do right so if he needed he needed he needed"
814000,823760," his own sdl he just implemented he won his own sdl so uh yeah uh hello ash and the riot uh thank you for"
823760,828320," the rate freeman 40 69 420 thank you thank you"
828320,835200," uh but sdl not that bad and you don't want to do it yourself"
835200,839600," how do you know if i do want to do it myself or don't want to do it myself"
841520,845520," maybe i do want to do it myself like who are you to tell me what to do"
845520,854960," i don't know john blow just implemented his own sdl works fine works on all the platforms works on"
854960,862480," windows works on mac os and works on linux and it's even more powerful than that it also handles 3d"
862480,867680," so i don't know maybe you don't want to do it yourself"
870160,880400," um but that sounds like your problem okay uh i'm gonna go to the kitchen super quick and uh turn on"
880400,894640," the kettle and uh yeah i'm gonna be back"
894640,896640," you"
896640,920320," just because you do nothing all the time doesn't mean you can accuse me of doing nothing"
921440,925040," uh so let me see"
925040,933200," uh let's continue so here's the why i forgot what i was actually implementing i forgot was"
933200,938480," actually implemented and i need to be super careful and somebody in the chat said that the time has come"
938480,950720," for w error and i think you are right because uh so if i actually do w air will that save me from"
950720,958160," from this kind of i wonder uh but yeah so first of all also let me actually do something like this"
958160,962720," just in case because i'm not sure if w air will save me from this kind of"
962720,964960," um yes yes yes yes"
964960,974560," and that i really like how my system like instantly froze it almost instantly fucking froze"
974560,977520," um yeah just"
977520,989200," holy uh one mistake and you've mistaken um okay statement with no effect okay so actually that helped"
990000,995360," that actually helped uh what if i remove exit so maybe the exit yeah so"
995360,998800," essentially what i have to do here is just to do plus plus"
998800,1004640," that's very interesting and that was extremely educational um yeah even though we lost a lot of"
1004640,1011200," viewers because of that um but at least i learned something i'm actually thinking"
1012400,1025200," uh maybe the time has come to implement my own sdl you know yeah because i am always like sad how sdl"
1025200,1030640," actually limiting me in what i can do right i could use opengl right but i want to"
1030640,1035600," abstract away from opengl as well maybe that also kind of cool"
1037040,1045600," uh i don't know but yeah in sdl sdl how many backends sdl has it has opengl back end it has direct 3d"
1045600,1054080," metal balkan frame buffer uh i think that's the old things i have from the top of my head maybe"
1054080,1059040," web it probably also has web uh maybe in the source code itself there is like a list of the"
1059040,1079040," uh available drivers and what not but yeah maybe the time has come to implement all trees"
1080480,1107920," who needs any goddamn music am i right"
1110480,1114480," so"
1114480,1121600," uh so now this thing seems to be working it seems to be twerking"
1121600,1129200," so it's gonna be via world and here is the grid that i was talking about but at some point it will"
1129200,1137280," become like a really unreadable and i'm thinking what would be the best uh like um threshold for"
1137280,1143760," actually hiding it uh the best threshold for actually hiding okay so this is going to be grid color"
1143760,1149280," right this is going to be a grid color and uh that didn't really do anything so let's put it this way"
1149280,1158880," and here it is so yeah it's it's really subtle i wonder if it affects the"
1161840,1167120," the encoding right now does it really affect anything i'm not quite sure but yeah"
1167120,1175600," okay so and yeah there we go"
1175600,1182640," but what's interesting is that it can move in all the directions"
1183920,1186800," which is which is which doesn't really make much sense because it shouldn't"
1186800,1188880," huh"
1188880,1195440," it can move in that direction it can move in that direction so there's something fishy going on"
1195440,1200080," um unless we try to do something like this right"
1202720,1211120," uh uh maybe i implemented it incorrectly because according to the description according to the"
1211120,1219920," original description it it actually stops when like in here but not really"
1219920,1225040," but i would expect it to be stopped"
1227760,1232640," so it was something like this right it was something like this"
1232640,1238320," uh three neighbors should not change yeah it seems it seems wrong"
1238320,1243600," no it's actually working it's actually working correctly"
1243600,1250240," as you can see it stops it actually expects a very specific uh a very specific orientation"
1250240,1254560," right it expects a very specific orientation which is interesting"
1254560,1265920," all right and uh so if i try to run something like bd all right uh we can clearly see that"
1265920,1274960," but if i now make uh square it's like a diode yes it goddamn is"
1281040,1282880," it is a diode how did you guess"
1282880,1292000," uh so for those who just joined recently uh so we're trying to look into this uh cellar automata"
1292000,1299840," which is actually suited for simulating transistors and like generally like electronics and whatnot"
1299840,1305680," so yeah and you can even like build turing complete computers in it or whatnot"
1307520,1314080," uh so and i really want to be able to seven segment display it would be kind of cool like where can i"
1314080,1320560," get more information on this thing because it's amazing there's not that many resources on this like"
1320560,1325680," thing um scientific american.com"
1330400,1336160," why do you need several course not only to buy the definition of the seller automaton we're implementing"
1336160,1343440," we're implementing a cellular automaton called wire world and it has four states of the cell by the"
1343440,1350800," definition of the seller automaton does it make sense so you can find the definition here uh and it"
1350800,1358960," describes it like as clear as it can so yeah uh so what do we have uh"
1360400,1371520," now okay wire world wire world computers so maybe we should try to uh this paper describes how we went"
1371520,1379360," about building a wire world computer although at least one design exists for a tape-based"
1379360,1386240," history machine machine implementation in the game world um so maybe we can download some actual"
1386240,1394320," files is there something something that we can download"
1394320,1404320," uh introduction so here's introduction so a head copper oh it's cool they called conductor copper so there's a head"
1404320,1413120," entail and uh the diode the diode looks like this okay so the dad there's also or gate oh that's cool"
1413120,1421200," there is a or gate uh exclusive or and not wrong oh can we may can we make an adder"
1421200,1433360," holy we need to make an adder since we have all these shits uh yeah so that's you can also oh there we go they"
1433360,1442240," even have a binary adder okay holy that's so cool yeah here it is is there any way to download any of"
1442240,1448240," these things uh in any particular format um experimental demonstration of the world"
1448240,1457680," uh okay holy because i know you could download like a leaf files specifically for seed"
1458480,1464480," right right can you download any files uh you can see in running convenient design here um"
1464480,1470800," it's programming oh is it actually implemented in java"
1470800,1473920," it could be actually implemented in java"
1473920,1480960," um okay experimental demonstration"
1484960,1493040," static wallpaper which can scale as you wish oh that's not bad"
1493040,1501600," maybe we can parse this thing from here that's kind of cool uh so yeah uh pixel by pixel we could"
1501600,1508800," probably actually parse it pixel by pixel um sounds like a very interesting idea i'm not gonna lie"
1509360,1514320," uh just parse it pixel by pixel uh just parse it pixel by pixel and then load it into our simulation"
1514320,1521760," and uh yeah that's super cool i want to do that chat um"
1525040,1529280," so but first let me take a selfie i'm sorry"
1541920,1549040," ah too much tea too much tea it's actually kind of awkward without any music maybe while i'm doing"
1549040,1562160," i'm doing nothing i'm doing nothing i'm not saying anything i should play music"
1562160,1584160," Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do."
1590880,1595200," why no music today because it's lagging and my computer is dying"
1595200,1603600," so it actually makes the music unbearable wish we could listen to music but we cannot"
1603600,1618880," but it's even better you know dmca and stuff like that um dm dmc i'm sorry um um it's gif"
1619600,1627280," who the puts static images okay so maybe it's a very old image"
1627280,1632800," and at the time maybe like using gif provided some sort of like a good compression and whatnot"
1633600,1647280," alrighty so let me see how we can do that uh so we have a grid and let me do a committee committee"
1647280,1652400," and maybe even a pusher pusher oh yeah i wanted to take a look at how grid looks like when you have"
1652400,1658640," uh 100 by 100 i think i think it looks like it must look like that's one of the reasons why i didn't"
1658640,1667840," want to introduce that uh square dot h where's one uh where's 20. jokes are new i have my own music"
1670240,1676960," i'm gonna ban you i'm gonna straight up how dare you how dare you to have your own music your band"
1676960,1686160," straight up uh all right so what we got are we gonna parse the gif pixel by pixel yes it's actually easier"
1686160,1694880," than you think uh because apparently i think it was generated in a very dumb way where literally a single"
1694880,1701760," pixel is a cell yeah you can even clearly see that look look look a single pixel well there"
1701760,1707600," is a little bit of bilinear interpolation right because i zoomed in but if we actually disable"
1707600,1716160," bilinear interpolation i think um it's a one pixel uh equals cell which makes it super easy to to parse and"
1716160,1726160," whatnot and i especially like these comments they they actually made comments with the conductor itself"
1726160,1731280," this is so cool and it it will it should work according to the definition of the cellular automaton"
1731280,1742160," it should actually work holy like oh this is so fun um all right so uh yeah by the way for those who"
1742160,1747040," doesn't know like who who want to take a look here it is also because it's a gift the colors are probably"
1747040,1757280," in this into static palette yeah yeah so uh i think we're gonna use uh sbt image i i'm pretty sure sbt"
1757280,1762800," image can't parse gifs it cannot parse animation of the gifs but it can at least parse the uh like a"
1762800,1767920," static image it's like minecraft circuits yeah maybe"
1767920,1777280," they work slightly fundamentally different uh but i mean yeah i guess"
1777280,1786720," i would argue that making computer in uh wire world should be a little bit easier than in minecraft red red"
1786720,1793040," redstone yeah because this looks less complex than some of the minecraft computers i've seen"
1793040,1801200," and ironically this looks less complex than some of the minecraft it's not that"
1801200,1805040," complex compared to what people do in minecraft come on um"
1809040,1817440," so uh so uh let me see uh i'm gonna run the uh wire world right and so how is the encoding by the way"
1817440,1827520," tell me that encoding is is it is it is it is it an ironically uh i'm pretty sure it is"
1831360,1843760," not yet uh it is very okay cool thank you very much so and this is the uh reason why i wanted to"
1843760,1845840," actually disable this entire thing or maybe we can"
1845840,1850960," maybe we can toggle it you know"
1852880,1856160," let's let's let's do it like this so uh it's gonna be like this pool"
1856160,1863760," grid right so this is gonna be boolean grid and essentially if context"
1863760,1871120," grid if context grid we're gonna move this entire in here here's a context kit"
1871120,1874720," uh only then we're gonna render the grid"
1875360,1880640," and every time we're handling all of the events so this is where we handle all of the events"
1880640,1886800," and then if context core"
1888960,1899200," keyboard keyboard uh g right if the user pressed g we're gonna do context grid not grude but grid"
1899200,1916320," uh so it's gonna be something like this"
1918960,1922960," so hello nutrix life welcome to the stream um no"
1922960,1929600," okay that should be all right actually so let me try to do a make minus b"
1929600,1941440," so well i mean there are more like reliable strats uh basically try to violate tos"
1941440,1948720," if you try to violate tos i think you're gonna get banned guaranteed but i heard some would"
1948720,1954400," say that it's a it's a little bit of a cheating right using the uh monka tos strat is a little"
1954400,1961200," bit of cheating so i think uh getting bad speed run should be without trying to violate the uh the tos"
1961200,1968960," this is like a more uh more hardcore way of of speed running the ban yeah but again if it doesn't"
1968960,1974560," work you can always just violate tos and you just instantly get banned so uh anyway"
1976880,1981040," not like i know anything about uh ban speed running strats i'm just the same"
1981040,1991680," uh all right so via world and now i can enable and disable grid as i want which is actually super"
1991680,1999040," convenient so now if i go to the square uh and i'm gonna just make it something like 20 by 20"
2000480,2006320," and i forgot to rebuild everything oh my god make minus b there we go"
2006320,2011600," violating normal law what is a normal law"
2011600,2014720," um"
2019200,2023680," oh you mean the vl live laws that's what you mean okay i see"
2023680,2032640," um"
2032640,2038000," it's kind of interesting how it's"
2038000,2046000," look look look look look this is so cool uh it actually splits horizontally if it goes vertically it will"
2046000,2050960," split horizontally but it if it if it goes uh horizontally it will split vertically"
2050960,2058080," this is so cool i like it uh wait a second this is so nice"
2058080,2062160," yeah this is so cool"
2070480,2074960," i think it will short circuit insta the the first instance i try to do something like this"
2074960,2079520," so let me first do it like that and then do it like this"
2079520,2086320," oh yeah you can actually cycle that that's so cool you can actually cycle that"
2086320,2095760," well it acts almost if you think about it it acts almost like an electron because electron is not"
2095760,2104320," particularly particle it's also a wave so it can go in two wires simultaneously right it can go into wire"
2104320,2112400," simultaneously um so yeah it it kind of does assimilate but i'm not a physicist so i don't really"
2112400,2122560," know much about it but yeah that's cool anyway you can also disable the grid and we're back not like electron"
2122560,2130800," uh okay so let's try to also"
2130800,2145520," cycle this i think i need to update my uh framework to be able to pick a specific cell uh to be able to pick a"
2145520,2146400," specific cell"
2146400,2152480," and it starts to isolate yeah it starts to isolate"
2152480,2161600," uh it's happened because you look neighbors that uh way right you can prioritize neighbor look up on"
2161600,2168240," the rows first why do i need to do why do i need to alter the the definition of the machine of the automate"
2168240,2174800," uh automaton like here's the definition i implemented the definition and it works the way it's supposed"
2174800,2181680," to work why do i have to change anything i don't understand what's the point um all right anyways"
2181680,2189040," uh so we introduced the grid so we also updated some of this stuff okay so i need to commit whatever we have"
2189040,2200880," already um so enable w error just in case uh i didn't enable this once"
2202240,2213680," and it killed uh my laptop monka uh laptop monka mega there we go so all right now from now on i'm gonna"
2213680,2221840," be enabling this holy shit i thought that w error actually sort of prevents me to quickly iterate on the"
2221840,2232400," development right but after this situation uh no i don't know i have a ptsd because of that um"
2232400,2241360," um all right so also um i'm gonna introduce the background"
2241360,2250560," um so here's the square here's the seats and game of life core nothing particularly special"
2251360,2267280," um um um make the backgrounds of atom atom atom atom atom uh transparent transparent there we go so they"
2267280,2281120," are transparent now um then uh yeah uh forgot to commit the yellow color right we're going to"
2281120,2286320," commit the yellow color and the next thing we need to do we need to introduce the grid"
2286320,2294800," functionality all right so by the way i think i need to add the controls in here right controls"
2294800,2301760," because core has its own controls as well so in a core mode you press space and you can pause"
2301760,2307760," and that is implemented for you uh here we can do the following thing uh something like g"
2308480,2320160," um toggle uh toggle uh toggle grid mode yeah let's just call it toggle grid commit message forgot to"
2320160,2322560," commit did i did i call it forgot to commit wait a second"
2322560,2330560," no i didn't okay uh so what do we have here"
2336880,2344240," so this is a draw line so this is a draw line uh-huh so is this something that i forgot to do"
2344240,2353040," no i apparently i forgot to actually uh re-align everything okay"
2355600,2366800," uh-huh implement uh implement uh grid uh mode for square square framework square framework so now we"
2366800,2374480," have just the argument and uh we also have like a slightly slowed down generation you know what i"
2374480,2382240," also want to be able to do i want you to be able to change the time out of the of the generations at"
2382240,2388080," run time as well if you know what i mean because recompile on everything every time you want to just"
2388080,2393760," slow down things it's kind of not particularly convenient in my opinion i think it would be better"
2393760,2404320," if we you know if we we be able to do that at uh at one time i think that will be actually pretty"
2404320,2408960," pogue and anyway i'm gonna push that right into the repo you can find the source code of everything we're"
2408960,2411920," doing here of course if you're interested in this kind of stuff"
2411920,2419200," uh all righty so what's going to be the next thing what's going to be the next thing"
2419200,2426800," um i'm just thinking do i want to work a little bit more on the runtime stuff i think i want to work"
2426800,2429760," a little bit more on runtime stuff and then we're going to try to parse the image"
2430800,2436320," of course uh so how for how for how long i'm streaming by the way so i'm going to stream up until"
2436320,2442640," um yeah so the reciting the stream actually screwed up with my timer and i don't know for how long i'm"
2442640,2450240," streaming already so it's going to be a little bit painful for me but yeah we'll see we'll see uh"
2451120,2460320," so in the core in the core what do we have in the core uh so we have the actual timeout right we have"
2460320,2471280," the actual timeout um and i needed two variables here actually i needed two variables so this is the"
2471280,2479280," timeout but the variable um yeah it should be called cooldown this should be called cooldown"
2479280,2485520," and then we're going to have next gen timeout which basically resets everything it basically resets"
2485520,2491920," everything uh the first bit was 57 okay so around an hour so i'm going to just add an hour to how much"
2491920,2497200," of streaming and then okay that's actually pretty convenient thank you thank you very much um i'm"
2497200,2502800," going to replace that with cool down right it's going to be cool down not that one but there we go"
2502800,2511920," uh and it seems to be working it seems to be twerking cool uh yeah then we can enable that and that's"
2511920,2521840," pretty cool so uh now in the core on top of that we're going to have next gen"
2521840,2532400," timeout right and when i do core begin i also initialize the timeout with um context"
2532400,2541280," next gen timeout with next gen initial timeout right"
2541280,2551760," initial timeout initial oh it's just gen timeout initial"
2551760,2559360," zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero five cool and and now what do we have here uh this one"
2559360,2573760," is going to be context next gen timeout there we go cool cool nice so after that uh we can try to add the"
2573760,2584160," in the handlers for the handlers for for things um to speed up stuff how can how are we going to speed up"
2584160,2591920," things case sdlk so g is already grid um r resets everything as far as i know"
2595520,2602880," so maybe x is going to speed up right but the question is how much we speed up and also"
2602880,2604560," speeding up should be"
2604560,2618880," um by multiplying maybe no okay x uh should reduce the timeout so it's going to be context"
2620480,2634080," uh con context i'm gonna type context next gen timeout uh and we actually just multiplying by five so"
2634080,2642240," essentially the smaller it is the slower it will be decreasing uh the bigger it is the bigger it should be"
2642240,2653120," increasing if i understand correctly right hopefully um yeah but it shouldn't be like bigger than certain"
2653120,2657840," value and it also shouldn't be smaller than a certain value so we're gonna have something like f"
2658640,2664080," max f between that and uh next gen"
2664080,2674400," minimum timeout timeout timeout minimum timeout something like this like minimum timeout there we go"
2674400,2683600," and that is kind of scuffed i don't like that but i can do it like this so and then sdl key uh x actually"
2683600,2689840," does what it reduces that means it speeds it up so z should actually increase it uh hence actually slow"
2689840,2699360," it down uh right so there we go there we go and this is going to be two and it shouldn't be bigger"
2699360,2708080," than max timeout and we have to define all these constants in here right next gen there we go uh so"
2708080,2714000," minimum is going to be probably maybe i don't know for how big we want to make it so this is going to"
2714000,2719760," be minimum maximum i think more than one second doesn't really make much sense but maybe you can"
2719760,2726240," make it as as big as you want right so the only thing we don't want to uh this thing to become is"
2726240,2733440," negative or zero so this is going to be the minimum timeout so maybe for for the max timeout uh we're not"
2733440,2739520," going to even you know limited you can make it as slow as you want doesn't make much difference um all"
2739520,2751680," right uh all right so maybe i'm gonna also run uh bb and so i can now slow it down"
2753360,2758160," right it should be super slow"
2758160,2768880," and what's interesting is that every time we change the next gen timeout i think we should reset"
2768880,2778800," uh next gen cooldown to that timeout uh otherwise if you make it super slow you will never be able to"
2778800,2785520," wait until the end of the next cooldown right so i think that's quite important uh if you know what i"
2785520,2792000," mean so we can slow down we can make it super slow and then we can keep increasing this thing and it"
2792000,2801360," doesn't get them work i wonder why um probably"
2801360,2811600," when you keep increasing it like it should actually divide it by two but i really want to know the"
2811600,2818240," actual value here so let me actually print this value so it's going to be something like f uh and"
2819360,2824720," i'm going to get the time out here because it's kind of difficult to see what the hell is going on"
2824720,2831520," so maybe at some point it just doesn't make any sense anymore uh yes yes yes yes yes"
2831520,2837600," and it doesn't print anything did i forgot to i forgot to recompile it"
2837600,2846800," god damn it i will never succeed in the game development industry holy okay i forgot to recompile and i'm"
2846800,2849600," trying to debug a program that i never fucking recompile"
2849600,2864720," but zozin just program in dynamic languages in dynamic languages you never have to compile anything and"
2864720,2873760," this just works but zozin ah ah it's your fault yes i know oh fuck make minus b bb"
2875600,2881840," uh all right and it just becomes very fucking slow and then you can increase it and you can make"
2881840,2886160," it super slow it goes slow down"
2886160,2892640," and then you can stop it goes"
2892640,2901680," what if we actually don't limit this entire i think i think it's gonna be kind of cool"
2902240,2906000," if you know what i mean so we're never going to be limited at some point it's going to be literally"
2906000,2909600," zero and once it hits zero we won't be able to go back"
2909600,2917920," yeah so once it hits zero you cannot"
2917920,2926800," slow down you literally cannot slow down because uh slowing down is based on multiplying by two but if you hit"
2926800,2933440," zero right because of the uh rounding and stuff like that it basically never goes up at all and that's"
2933440,2939040," why i have this limitation right you can make it you cannot make it smaller than this value otherwise"
2939040,2942400," you won't you won't you won't be able to recover it in the sort of 40."
2942400,2953360," uh so we can go and then you can slow down you can make it as slow as you want"
2965360,2971520," maybe by two is too much right so here we actually dividing it by two right so this is division by two"
2971520,2978960," and then multiplication what if we actually divide it by one and a half so maybe it will create a better feeling"
2983040,2985440," yeah it starts to kind of make a little bit more sense"
2985440,2998720," yeah by half is a little bit better okay so that's pretty cool so"
3001120,3014720," x speed uh gen tick up uh slow gen tick down uh is it is it too much"
3014720,3025600," uh slow down the gen tick yeah so space to compose and it will be actually actually kind of cool to also"
3025600,3034240," have an indication that uh you're speeding up or slowing down but uh like with pose like with pose"
3034240,3041120," but i'm not 100 sure i'm not 100 sure but maybe that should be all right"
3041120,3051440," ah cool so and it should work on all the machines though so you can slow it down and then i can try to run"
3052080,3055920," uh if i rebuild everything of course i think we should try to rebuild everything"
3055920,3061840," why do i rebuild this one by one i can just do minus g5 and it rebuilds all of them simultaneously"
3061840,3070880," and i can slow down and i can speed this thing up and then i can slow down again"
3070880,3073760," yeah so that's pretty cool"
3075600,3082480," it's pretty cool framework i'm not gonna lie it's like goalie but alive as a library imagine if goalie"
3082480,3086800," was a library like c library that's what i'm developing one thing that programmers can easily"
3086800,3092400," get a job and if not he can earn he did you just assume the programmer's gender"
3095280,3107600," be careful with that especially on twitch uh so all right now let's do a committee committee"
3107600,3109280," i'm sorry sorry for what"
3109280,3114400," her daddy taught us not to be ashamed of war"
3117120,3120000," wow wow what can't come up with the joke"
3120000,3125520," so let me see"
3125520,3129200," add"
3129200,3132000," uh"
3132000,3135600," slowing down"
3135600,3137920," speeding up"
3142160,3142720," implement"
3142720,3142720," implement"
3142720,3145520," changing speed"
3145520,3146400," of"
3146400,3147360," can tick"
3147360,3149200," at runtime"
3149200,3153760," uh room time what's what is a room time"
3153760,3156880," let's push that"
3162320,3162640," cool"
3162640,3162880," cool"
3162880,3162880," cool"
3162880,3162880," cool"
3162880,3162880," cool"
3162880,3162880," cool"
3162880,3167440," okay so we have a pretty powerful framework now"
3167440,3174960," but what's interesting is that some of the things are implemented on different levels of the"
3174960,3177120," of the frameworks"
3177120,3185360," for example one of the things that you can do in wire world is essentially add these things right"
3185360,3188000," but you cannot do that in"
3188720,3189040," rule"
3189040,3197120," one one one oh because rule one one oh is not a lifelike cellular automaton right so because it"
3197120,3201200," doesn't really work in a two-dimensional grid you can see a two-dimensional grid in here"
3201200,3203440," but it does not evaluate a two-dimensional grid"
3203440,3208240," it evaluates on a one-dimensional one and we use two-dimensional grid to just"
3208240,3215760," show the evolution of the states so it doesn't use the live framework it uses only square framework"
3216480,3221360," which is kind of interesting i think i think it's kind of interesting and all that works together"
3221360,3225920," like i really like how we reuse the code how efficiently we reuse the code and everything just"
3225920,3226240," works"
3226240,3233440," everything just works isn't that beautiful i think it's good beautiful mate"
3235840,3240560," so uh let's actually make it maybe even i want to make it bigger"
3245120,3252800," hello frontal birth site uh the joint wonder i'm seeing here looks interesting you're seeing our"
3252800,3260160," experimentations with cellular atom atom automata cellular atom salary automata that's that's what we're"
3260160,3267440," doing so if you never heard of the salary tomatoes it's like um uh small machines on the grid"
3268080,3274960," right so you can read more about them here i suppose uh or maybe i can give you a wikipedia article so there"
3274960,3281280," is a wikipedia article there as well uh yeah celery tomatoes yes"
3284080,3294240," okay so let me see if i try to recompile that yes yes yes yes yes okay and i can always speed it up i"
3294240,3299360," can always just speed it up and it will just work oh by the way what if i speed up the bb the bb is a"
3299360,3303440," brian's brain right so it looks like this and i can always speed it up and it's gonna it's gonna go"
3303440,3313520," faster faster and then we can always slow it down it's gonna go very very slow and then speed it up and"
3313520,3323600," just go very fast uh yes yes yes that's very cool okay so the next thing we need to do we need to be"
3323600,3331360," able to parse this thing um how we're going to do that i'm going to use stb library uh so let me find"
3331360,3337600," nothings stb and i'm going to just grab stb image um let me see let me see"
3337600,3347760," stb stb image stb image all right so stb image resize i don't really need to resize or write anything i"
3347760,3357120," only want to be able to read images um so let me take a look at the raw version and i'm just gonna download"
3357120,3366800," raw gachi version of stb uh image let's see q uh so how we're gonna do that"
3366800,3373040," so i'm gonna actually create a separate thing um"
3373040,3383200," a reader let's call the reader so uh it's not going to use any particular frameworks uh we're just going to"
3383200,3387680," include stb image we're just going to include this to be image and i'm going to try to"
3387680,3392880," uh read the image and recover the computer from that image"
3392880,3399200," so we also have to define something like this to be image implementation if i remember correctly"
3399200,3404080," to answer bloat well i mean it's a single library"
3408720,3416240," speaking of look look look look i opened this library in emacs look look"
3419280,3424960," and we can quickly jump to the end and it has seven uh thousand seven uh seven hundred and sixty"
3424960,3430560," two seven thousand seven hundred and sixty two lines of code and emacs can navigate through them really"
3430560,3438640," really quickly look at how fast it is yeah it scrolls so emacs is not slow seriously c mode is"
3438640,3446720," shit c mode is straight up fucking shit seriously uh all right so what we need to do here we need to"
3446720,3454720," define this entire thing and let's try to do that so maybe i'm going to also accept some arguments uh"
3455360,3474400," so and if argc less than zero we're going to say fprintf uh std error this can be error uh no input is"
3474400,3483760," provided and uh we're also going to say what kind of input is expected there uh so yeah we're going to put it"
3483760,3497040," like this exit one print tab std error usage reader uh some sort of like an image gif right so something"
3497040,3507280," like this this is what we expect here and and now i can do stbi or read or i think load yeah this is how"
3507280,3513520," we do that you just load this thing like that so this will give me a data file name is going to be"
3513520,3518080," let's actually define file name like this it becomes char file name argv"
3518080,3527200," uh argv one right uh not less than zero less than two come on bruh and it's going to be xyn"
3527200,3532400," uh and i don't remember what is zero to be fair is it like expected"
3534400,3543040," uh expected thing all right uh basically to encode it to something else um now i'm going to try to print"
3543040,3555600," all of them uh d uh that says gonna be d as well x i didn't want to do that x yn and by the way if data"
3556160,3569920," equal no um not equal no right um i'm gonna do it like that else um f printf um std error"
3569920,3581680," could not uh read file uh s s and if i'm pretty sure it it sets error no in case of an error so this is"
3581680,3587360," probably something that we can utilize here as to error error error uh no there we go and then we're"
3587360,3594000," going to exit with one uh exit with one and uh what else do we have here it's going to be std"
3594000,3606960," leap and maybe string and maybe error no there we go uh make minus b make minus b okay so maybe i just need to"
3606960,3618400," um go in here and then put a reader in here and only build that reader there we go so what do we have"
3618400,3625840," here and thank you very much and this is why i cannot use wr because stb is written like"
3627600,3634960," comparison and i'm pretty sure like speaking of did i remember that some people submitted uh pull"
3634960,3643680," requests to fix that warning has he ever addressed that does he even look at that uh uh signed right"
3643680,3656000," signed and signed uh i remember so initial signed no it doesn't compare comparison compare"
3656640,3663280," comparison okay another one of course it was fixed and never actually merged"
3663280,3671760," all right so sure whatever it's open source"
3671760,3678880," it's open source what did you want from open source all right so you get that for free anyway"
3678880,3682720," right so you you don't you don't complain which which makes sense i think it's fair enough"
3683440,3688400," uh did i download the gif i think i didn't download the gif let's actually quickly download the gif and"
3688400,3697680," take a look at all of that shite okay um so we downloaded this can you fix it on your local copy sure"
3698240,3701200," uh now brand reader"
3701200,3708560," there we go so huh"
3708560,3714320," what is four i forgot is that the amount of channels i don't quite remember what is it"
3724560,3732240," okay now i want to do some sort of like a histogram if you know what i mean and compute"
3732240,3740240," like how many colors do we have here right how many colors do we have we have a white color"
3740240,3746320," blue color and the copper"
3748480,3754160," okay okay let's do that so it's going to be a reader and so"
3754160,3762480," so let's do something like this is going to be probably uin32t and that will require to include"
3762480,3767680," to include std int right it will require include std int"
3769680,3777520," and we're going to have colors colors capacity capacity so let's actually set colors capacity to"
3777520,3782800," 800 by 600 because that's the expected resolution in here"
3782800,3790960," that's the expected resolutions and we're going to have something like size color size"
3796880,3805120," uh number of code oh my god people you have the open source thingy you could have just looked it up"
3805120,3808560," uh i i asked just a rhetorical question like"
3808560,3818320," it's somewhere there whatever i think it's amount of channels because it also encodes it whatever"
3819040,3822880," um so um"
3822880,3824640," stb i load"
3824640,3834960," channels and file it's amount of channels basically four bytes right so it's going to be 32 bits so"
3834960,3843200," and for gifs it probably encodes it into 32 bits and whatnot uh and you then you can have a desired"
3843200,3848480," channels as well right and desired channels that basically will decode like re like converted for"
3848480,3858560," you um all right so add color so and you can provide you in 32 uh you can provide the color and first"
3858560,3863120," we need to check if the color exists right and we need to check if the color exists"
3863120,3872640," uh and we can do it like this uh boolean um color exists exists exists"
3875360,3882480," yeah yeah yeah yeah this is all of n data structure you don't have to tell me that twice i know that"
3882480,3891120," you think i care i don't uh for size"
3891120,3895360," zozin it's slow"
3898160,3901920," my cs degree is useless"
3901920,3910240," my cs degree is useless zozin it's slow ah okay colors uh if uh color equal that"
3910240,3914800," then we're gonna say that it does exist and then it does not exist cool"
3921440,3936480," so another thing if color does not exist so isn't it square um colors colors size plus plus it's going"
3936480,3944000," to be cooler cool okay so now we can adjust that colors and another thing i want to do here is essential"
3944000,3948560," oh by the way speaking of speaking of i need to do an assertion just in case that"
3949280,3957760," colors size is less than the color's capacity right if it's equal or greater that means uh something went"
3957760,3966400," wrong and yes yes yes okay so um so i'm gonna do that and i'm gonna iterate through all of the"
3966400,3976160," shit here it's gonna be in this i then less than x multiplied by y plus plus i okay and then i'm gonna add the"
3976160,3981680," color um i have to reinterpret that i definitely have to reinterpret that on top of that by the way i"
3981680,3986880," want to assert that n is equal four uh and this one is going to be u in 32"
3986880,3992400," and no no no no that one not that one uh but rather this one"
3992400,4002800," so here's the data we expect that uh qqq and it's going to be data i so we add all the scores"
4004640,4012480," uh colors size is going to be uh z u and it's going to be equal to what colors"
4012480,4021600," size there we go there we go and then if i try to recompile this reader not render a reader reader"
4026480,4043840," so and we have exactly four colors in here would you look at that you look at that isn't that amazing"
4043840,4049840," so because there's four of the possible states we can now try to print those colors right"
4051600,4057600," it's going to be cooler size uh color size and we're going to print them like so i'm going to"
4057600,4067840," do print uh let's just do print and it's going to be zero x then um usually have four that means zero eight"
4067840,4076400," x uh and then we're going to do uh colors hi and let's take a look at how many colors we have there"
4077120,4086560," and there we go here are all of the colors isn't that amazing so yeah essentially you can use this"
4086560,4096240," image as an input file and you can map these colors to specific states right you can say that uh this is"
4096960,4101680," straight up red and that's really strange red not gonna lie"
4101680,4110560," oh oh this is a transparent red okay oh i don't even know what's the format here though"
4110560,4112800," what's the goddamn format"
4112800,4121120," so okay this is probably alpha right because it's the same for everyone right so this is probably alpha"
4123120,4131840," uh so that means maybe it's actually a bgr or something so this if this is a red if this is a"
4131840,4142960," red this is definitely um conductor right this is white so that means it's a head uh this is a background"
4142960,4148880," and this thing is very bluish which makes it the the tail okay that's actually pretty cool"
4148880,4157360," um the background color seems to be missing no the background is here so i think it's uh wait a second"
4157360,4165280," a bgr i think it's a bgr but i'm not quite sure at least it feels like it's um"
4168000,4173520," and we can always experiment with different things uh big engine maybe it's also beginning who knows it"
4173520,4182080," doesn't matter so we can just basically mess with the bytes until it works so it's not that not that hard"
4187040,4192240," it should be it should be four states plus background no background is the fourth state"
4192240,4202560," you have empty cell head tail conductor four states background is the state"
4209280,4228000," all right so how are we gonna even do that so i'm gonna actually bake this entire stuff into the uh into"
4228000,4235360," the wire world and we're gonna initialize the um the board with specifically that"
4238720,4245920," so how we're gonna do all of this so we're gonna have an assertion assert that uh rose"
4245920,4253200," is equal exactly actually we can do a static assert all right we can do a static assert here"
4253200,4261920," static assert rose is has to be equal exactly that"
4264560,4271280," or maybe should be greater or equal okay so it should be greater or equal it makes sense and columns is"
4271280,4274880," should be greater or equal than uh 800 so"
4274880,4282720," uh i'm just thinking whether i want to make it a runtime check or not runtime check"
4282720,4290640," um let's make it runtime check because i i will be modifying these values anyway so let's"
4290640,4299440," let's let's make it runtime um after that i need to basically port everything we've done here so far"
4299440,4308640," uh right so here it is uh so we have colors we don't need to do any of this stuff"
4310240,4318400," uh we probably need to do this thing and yeah we need to read everything here"
4318400,4329440," so here is going to be that uh wire world no input files provided then file input is going to be that"
4330160,4336480," uh then we're loading everything we're asserting that n is going to be equal to four then another thing we"
4336480,4345760," want to assert that x is going to be equal to 800 to be fair you know what we can assert this kind of"
4345760,4353120," stuff slightly differently we can assert it like this rows should be greater or equal than y and calls"
4353120,4358320," should be greater than equal than x okay that that's actually way better in my opinion that's actually way"
4358320,4368880," better um so and if we couldn't uh read this entire stuff if we couldn't read this entire stuff if it's"
4368880,4380160," equal to uh null uh yeah i'm just thinking so maybe it could be something like this file name equal to s"
4380160,4386480," just print all the information that you read uh just in case and if you couldn't just complain about that"
4386480,4390560," and now the time has come now the time has come"
4390560,4401040," make the image optional i haven't finished the code holy okay i haven't finished uh all right"
4402720,4409840," i'm gonna ignore the chat oh shit okay row um hello ralph welcome to the stream rose"
4409840,4421440," zero i wish i had the music but the music unfortunately is super laggy and i don't know how to fix it"
4424000,4433360," so using your code is not finished free fucking re why are you writing unfinished code"
4433360,4446560," stop writing unfinished code susan it's dumb oh shit okay that was a bad idea i wish you could have a"
4446560,4456480," music uh but we cannot have music uh"
4456480,4461360," fuck"
4461360,4468800," uh so uh what are we doing so this is going to be the boards um"
4470400,4481280," the board cells right oh that's actually a very interesting thing can i now i cannot unfortunately"
4481280,4494160," there is a pretty cool feature in c99 it's a very cool feature essentially um"
4498080,4505040," you have a function right and you pass some sort of an array right uh let's put it this way so you"
4505040,4511520," have access and you have two dimensional array so maybe you pass in the board right and you can"
4511520,4519120," do the following uh thing you can specify roles and you can specify columns and then you can say"
4519120,4526640," that the roles and columns are going to be uh the dimensions of this array and then you can actually"
4526640,4532720," access this as a two-dimensional array and the compiler will automatically use these variables"
4532720,4539520," for computing exactly uh like the the specific element of the two-dimensional array so of course"
4539520,4545680," at runtime like even at compile time from the point of view of type system this still decays"
4545680,4553280," into a pointer right so it doesn't really add that much of the type safety but also at runtime it"
4553280,4560160," generates the code that appropriately that correctly computes the offsets of rows and columns so this"
4560160,4568720," is a actually super cool feature do you guys know about it uh it's actually super cool um because you"
4568720,4574400," won't be able to do something like that by doing something like this right because it's just a pointer"
4574400,4581280," so the compiler doesn't know how much you have to offset because it doesn't know the size of the row right in in"
4581280,4586400," so you can see two-dimensional arrays if you have like this kind of array uh right two-dimensional"
4586400,4594400," it's actually uh stored row wise right it's stored row wise like this so it's actually linear in the"
4594400,4601120," memory and to find the actual place right in actual element you have to know the sizes of the row so we"
4601120,4609120," can skip rows and then find the the actual element and that sort of code helps the compiler to uh know the"
4611280,4617360," columns and so on and so forth does it make sense and why am i saying that why am i saying that i'm"
4617360,4623040," saying that because i want to do something like this um and i'm pretty sure it's not going to work"
4624400,4627280," uh but it would be kind of cool if it worked uh"
4627280,4636960," because i don't want to compute it myself but if it's gonna work yeah it will yeah so because"
4636960,4644640," this particular context it has the type of an array uh but this thing returns a pointer so they're"
4644640,4650240," basically incompatible types they're basically incompatible types so it's kind of it's kind of a problem in"
4650240,4656400," here so we'll have to compute the you know the sizes and offsets actually ourselves which is"
4656400,4666320," but i mean it's reasonable i guess it's a reasonable thing to do so data so uh a row multiplied by the"
4666320,4672880," columns plus columns so this is how we do so the size of the uh single row is the amount of columns and"
4672880,4678000," we basically multiply by the amount of rows and we find the offset and then we get the the columns and"
4678000,4684880," there you go but this is not how we want to do that essentially we want to switch upon different uh"
4684880,4692000," values there right uh here are all the values that we want to actually check so we're going to put them"
4692000,4706960," like this cool so and now this is the background so that means that uh board cells row and column"
4707600,4712480," is going to be empty i think we do have a value for empty yeah there we go so this is empty"
4712480,4721200," uh now so this if i'm going to assume that it's like a red thing right so uh it's more of an orange"
4721200,4733520," so that means this one is what oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy um it's a conductor yes it's a conductor"
4734720,4747840," uh this is white that means i think it's a head uh if i understand correctly it's a head yes so we're"
4747840,4752400," going to make it a head and this one a little bit more bluish that means it's going to be"
4752400,4760480," uh a tail right and anything else is essentially a known thing uh maybe we're going to even do it like"
4760480,4767360," that oh by the way i forgot the brakes in here so let's actually put the brakes let's put the brakes"
4767360,4775120," let's put the brakes and there we go and where is he from who who are you talking about"
4779040,4783760," who are you talking about poland poland who's poland i don't understand"
4783760,4797840," netherlands but who are we talking about who is he i don't understand unexpected color and it's gonna be"
4797840,4807760," something like uh 8x and uh we're gonna put it like this all right you uh so you're talking about me in a"
4807760,4821040," third person in front of me so you're that root okay i'll keep that in mind okay so uh what else do we have"
4821040,4831440," here so we have this kind of color isn't data x long and not calls long"
4831440,4838400," depends on what you mean i don't quite understand"
4838400,4844800," you're doing rows columns instead of rows x columns"
4847600,4850880," yeah that's true so it has to be x you're right thank you"
4850880,4865760," all right so unexpected color that and we're gonna exit with one"
4872000,4879840," all right all right all right so you know what i also want to start the life in pose the state so"
4879840,4888560," live goal uh let's actually also set it like posed but we pose in the core so and to access the core"
4888560,4896880," we have to go deep into the square and then core and then posed uh is it posed true"
4898800,4905600," uh all right so let's try to compile this entire thing i'm gonna uh specifically uh build wire world"
4905600,4912000," and it doesn't compile because it's probably called pose doesn't it yes it's called pose oh my god it's"
4912000,4920640," so annoying okay so we don't have argc char argv does it compile now it still doesn't compile"
4925840,4937040," oh it's also it's also complained about some of my code as well so initialization of uh unsigned int"
4937040,4945040," incompatible yeah i know that it's incompatible i'm i'm totally okay with that i'm totally okay with"
4945040,4951600," that i know that it's not compatible just shut up and let me do my thing i don't know okay so let's"
4951600,4964720," introduce uh string dot h error null and uh is it gonna okay so now i assumed yet again that uh this"
4964720,4976400," is a pointer which is it's not it's actually an actual value um q um wire world okay so now i need to go to the"
4976400,4988480," square and set uh eight to six and let's see if it's correct or not i'm a little bit nervous uh chat"
4988480,4995680," i'm a little bit nervous let's actually see so wire world um yeah i fucked up with new lines as usual"
4995680,5000320," uh i forgot to put a new line in here all right i forgot to put a new line in here"
5000320,5013440," oh boy oh boy uh make minus b wire world uh something like that and okay so that's that's reasonable uh"
5013440,5017600," wire world uh okay"
5019840,5024640," so where is the gift thingy how is the gift thingy called oh it's it's called like this"
5024640,5042480," so if i did everything correctly there we go um all right um cool are you ready to unpause it"
5045520,5047040," it's super slow actually"
5047040,5058720," uh it is extremely slow if you ask me but it's doing things i suppose uh"
5058720,5065760," i wonder how yeah it's okay yeah it's it's also really difficult to see what's going on but"
5066560,5073360," uh encoding to try yeah so encoding actually kills the center i think so but uh it's it's doing its best"
5073360,5080720," maybe we shouldn't floor fit when i yeah yeah so the problem here is that like"
5080720,5086160," it doesn't form proper um proper lines and whatnot"
5086160,5095280," but at least you can see like uh 19 and i wonder how much time does it take to actually compute all of this"
5097360,5101520," so can you see that it's 19 here yeah you can clearly see that it's 19"
5101520,5104320," uh i don't know how to do that"
5104320,5110720," okay can you can you see much uh"
5110720,5124880," um seems pretty cool and again i really like how he he or they used the uh the conductors for for the"
5124880,5131840," comments and whatnot uh all right let me see if i can improve the quality a little bit so when i'm"
5131840,5136560," rendering the square or rather in a quarter right when i'm doing in the core"
5136560,5138000," uh"
5140000,5147120," the two so i'm gonna do the feel uh erect the feel erect what if i don't floor fit all right what if i"
5147120,5149440," seal it because it gets"
5149440,5153440," what the fuck excuse me"
5157520,5164800," see if you guys asking too many questions"
5164800,5181920," make msb wild world all right so is it gonna okay you can see shit now"
5184560,5199520," i wish it was a little bit faster how can we make it faster though is there any way to make it faster"
5204640,5207520," um so i'm thinking"
5207520,5211520," how to make it better"
5211520,5214960," yeah it's extremely slow"
5214960,5218400," we can try to"
5218400,5224240," just increase just to see what's going on"
5227040,5235280," yeah"
5235280,5240800," i'm just waiting when it's going to change to 18."
5240800,5246880," i wonder if it will change to 18 at some point i think it's like encodes a countdown or what not"
5249520,5250560," at least it's trying to"
5250560,5257920," we definitely need to implement some sort of like um"
5257920,5263680," zoom in system i think it could be actually super convenient"
5263680,5270640," oh yeah so i managed to actually load things up"
5274640,5278080," can you change color so it's a little bit more clear we can try to use the original"
5278080,5283840," course the colors that they used um but they are slightly inverted right they're slightly inverted"
5283840,5291920," uh okay so the original colors that they used are these all right do we need to invert them"
5291920,5295200," uh so"
5298160,5311680," i'm just gonna copy paste this into i think i'm just put a look like that and it's like this"
5311680,5326080," so the empty should be zero actually yes empty should be zero the conductor the conductor"
5326880,5339440," uh itself should be something like zero x uh ff 80 zero zero ff right um the head the head"
5339440,5344560," is actually white right so white"
5344560,5350800," and the tail is zero zero"
5350800,5352960," yeah"
5355760,5356960," zero zero zero zero zero eighteen"
5356960,5365360," so something like this we can use the colors from the image itself"
5365360,5369760," and maybe that will make it a little bit better"
5369760,5376800," so is it better it's it actually looks like the gif it literally looks like the gif"
5376800,5384560," so this is gif and this is our rendering and uh we can just start doing things"
5384560,5389040," this looks like this"
5389040,5394000," does it look better"
5394000,5407360," but the numbers are clearer now cool"
5410240,5418880," so yeah that's the actual timer i suppose i'm not sure what exactly it is but uh and i don't know"
5418880,5423360," how much time it will take to actually flip the number i suppose it will flip the number at some"
5423360,5428080," point but it's kind of difficult to tell uh i wish it could uh we could speed it up"
5430480,5435920," is this an electronic circuit you simulated not really i'm simulating something called wire world"
5435920,5442960," wire world so google apple is wire world it's a cellular automaton"
5442960,5450960," which is suitable for simulating uh electronics and what we did we actually downloaded the um"
5452160,5458800," i guess some sort of like a circuit developed by the creator of this cellular automaton and we put it in"
5458800,5464000," our simulator first we implemented the simulator for this particular similar cellular automaton and then"
5464000,5470480," we uh loaded the circuit and actually simulated it on our machine uh for the purpose of actually seeing"
5470480,5474800," if it works or not it's doing something it's doing something but i'm not sure what exactly it's doing"
5474800,5482000," exactly it's doing and when the number is going to flip so um yeah and i wonder if we'll be able to"
5482000,5490160," speed it up at some point and how can we speed it up actually is there any way for us to speed it up"
5495280,5508640," all right um so because uh we for the past three days for the past three days what we were doing we"
5508640,5514480," were messing with different cellular automators automata at at i don't know how to pronounce this"
5514480,5522480," cellular tomato um so and uh this is one of them this is one of them and it's actually pretty cool"
5523920,5531280," and by the way speaking of uh i'm gonna keep it like uh on this separate separate thingy we loaded"
5531280,5540000," this circuit literally from image so they provided an image uh with like a gif image and we had to"
5540000,5545120," yeah the only way for us to actually simulate it and put it in our machine is to load it directly from"
5545120,5553680," the image um so wonder how can we speed it up what what what's the best way to speed it up"
5553920,5559040," um"
5559040,5559840," not quite sure"
5559840,5569200," is there a delay sleep somewhere to slow down so we can see the animation feels like a"
5569200,5572960," shouldn't be that slow okay i'm gonna actually slow it down"
5575840,5582400," um"
5582400,5589280," i don't know what you're trying to see here i don't know"
5589280,5596400," uh but to be fair i want to keep it as fast as possible because i want to see when it's going to"
5596400,5599840," switch to something or whether it's ever going to switch to something"
5601760,5604880," parallelize probably that's not a bad idea actually"
5604880,5614480," can you simulate antics for every frame to see how it is yeah that's actually a pretty interesting"
5614480,5619760," idea as well um yeah i need to write it down so um"
5619760,5625120," where's my readme where it is"
5625120,5627600," um"
5627600,5633040," speed maybe i need to actually put it somewhere in"
5635200,5636640," in a life um"
5636640,5642800," square is the next gen okay"
5642800,5651280," speed up simulation"
5651280,5653680," ideas"
5656320,5656960," several"
5656960,5660640," several uh states per tick"
5660640,5664960," parallelization"
5664960,5669520," so sounds like a pretty pretty good way to go yeah"
5669520,5672400," it could be interesting"
5676400,5683200," uh we might uh help shaders help though uh what"
5683200,5691600," all right so i'm gonna make a cup of tea does anyone have any questions while i'm making a cup of tea"
5691600,5695520," does anyone have any questions"
5700880,5701920," it would be cool to"
5701920,5708160," actually make the image loader"
5708160,5716400," a part of the like square framework as well or live framework as well i think that would be kind of cool"
5728480,5731680," is the calculation taking slog or the rendering i have no idea i just"
5731680,5738400," implemented the simulator and i loaded some circuit from the internet and there you go so"
5738400,5744080," you think i know what's going on no i have no idea what is going on i just implemented the simulation"
5744080,5751520," that's it i didn't look into why exactly it's slow because i just run it um like"
5751520,5756560," just literally 10 minutes ago i just finished implementing this thing 10 minutes ago and you're"
5756560,5760000," asking all this question to me like do i look like somebody who knows what the"
5760000,5761680," is going on i'm just implementing it"
5761680,5769520," i wasn't aware you just started well people accuse me of uh writing unfinished code on stream"
5769520,5771600," all the time so i'm kind of got used to that don't worry about it"
5771600,5773360," so"
5773360,5779040," uh all right so"
5779040,5786000," i really want to make a small break but without any music it's kind of awkward to make the breaks"
5786000,5786240," so"
5786240,5795920," because if i try to play some music right now it's definitely going to be choppy"
5795920,5804160," i have no idea"
5804160,5810320," this is not as i'm seriously need to make a break and this is not helping me joking around about that"
5810320,5810960," that doesn't help me"
5810960,5814000," um"
5814000,5817600," yeah it's it's"
5817600,5824560," maybe not"
5826640,5833520," it's actually not that bad maybe all right let's make a small break and uh yeah let's see how it goes"
5833520,5837600," okay i'm gonna stop this one because it probably slows down a lot"
5838800,5846720," so uh the next thing we could do okay we have two ideas i have two ideas try to speed up the simulation"
5846720,5855040," try to speed up simulation or try to look at other cellular automata because we have at least two of"
5855040,5863440," them uh with the gas automation and some ends and uh i don't know which one to be"
5863440,5868480," fair we have a lot of time right so we only streamed for almost three hours to be fair we're"
5868480,5873840," streaming almost for almost three hours so it's hard to tell if we're gonna have enough time for all of"
5873840,5879280," that so but speeding up things is kind of fun so yeah"
5881680,5883440," it's hard to tell um"
5883440,5888080," uh small break um let me do it by that"
5888080,5892080," three minutes"
5892080,5898240," right"
5898240,5907440," what is the ants one for to study and behavior i have no idea i didn't look into that but you can"
5908080,5915280," uh go to the project and click on the link about ants because everything i have here"
5915280,5922080," right is available publicly on github the only thing you need to do you need to do project command"
5922080,5928320," click on this link read carefully find the link link that link and read about that specific cellular atom"
5928320,5934560," automaton right i've no idea i didn't read it this read about it this was suggested by the viewers so"
5935040,5941760," yeah i don't know what it is uh we'll take a look at it i never like read about wow world either and i"
5941760,5946800," just implemented it on the stream and yeah that's pretty cool anyway so let's make a small break you"
5946800,5947360," You guys have fun."
5976800,6006780," You guys have fun."
6006800,6036780," You guys have fun."
6036800,6066780," You guys have fun."
6066800,6096780," You guys have fun."
6096800,6126780," You guys have fun."
6126800,6134000," All right."
6134000,6135320," The music seems to be okay."
6135320,6137500," How everyone is doing?"
6137500,6140140," So let's continue."
6140140,6141380," You know what I got?"
6143280,6144820," I got a pretty cool idea."
6144820,6154320," I want to take the code that loads the wire world's circuit and move it into the live framework."
6154880,6164160," And I also want to extend the functionality of actually taking the current state of the live thingy and dumping it as an image."
6165020,6176220," So let's implement the thing that you not only will be able to load an image as a circuit, but also dump the current state as a circuit, as an image to load back later."
6177420,6178700," I think that's very cool."
6178700,6185040," I think that would be actually super cool."
6185040,6192020," And that should work with any of the cellular automata."
6193020,6199980," Yeah, imagine like taking the Brian's brain and save it as an image and then just passing to someone else and just load it up."
6199980,6201280," I think it's actually kind of cool."
6202480,6203640," Hello, Potato Passing Bio."
6203640,6204380," Welcome to the stream."
6204380,6213540," And what's cool is that you can always check out the state of the world without having this problem because it's just an image."
6213540,6215820," So we keep the state in the image itself."
6215820,6218000," Okay, so my tea is ready."
6218000,6221100," I'm going to quickly pour the cup of water and then back."
6221100,6251080," I'm going to quickly pour the cup of water and then back."
6251100,6252300," I think it will be kind of cool."
6252300,6271120," I'm really glad the music is actually working."
6271120,6272480," At least I can listen to it now."
6275940,6284680," So I definitely want to maybe save some of this stuff."
6284680,6286480," Okay."
6286480,6292000," So let's put, let's create a folder with images."
6292000,6294980," Let's create a folder with images."
6294980,6296700," So here's going to be that."
6302940,6306140," So, and I also want to put a readme in here."
6306140,6306740," Right."
6306740,6310800," Images of"
6310800,6312540," of"
6312540,6314740," different"
6314740,6315800," different"
6315800,6317540," life-like"
6317540,6319400," game"
6319400,6320640," states."
6320640,6326400," Life-like."
6326400,6327160," Yeah, yeah."
6327160,6327900," So, yeah."
6327900,6329080," Like, like, like."
6329080,6330020," Why is it called?"
6330540,6330900," Wait."
6330900,6332400," I'm an idiot."
6332400,6338180," Yesterday I actually read it like, like."
6338180,6340180," Am I that dumb?"
6340180,6342600," I have a dyslexia."
6342600,6343580," Holy shit."
6343580,6349700," Okay."
6351000,6357340," So, and, uh, basically, uh, we were talking."
6357340,6358100," Yeah, I see."
6358100,6361340," I'm, I probably need to visit the doctor at some point."
6361340,6362260," Holy shit."
6362260,6371060," Okay."
6371060,6374000," Um, so."
6377300,6391260," Um, so I'm going to put this thing here."
6391260,6404340," Um, so I'm going to actually remove this thing."
6405560,6407880," Um, what else do we have?"
6407880,6409180," Um, so I don't need the reader."
6409180,6417180," Um, the reader and, uh, in the make file, we don't need to build the reader anymore."
6417180,6418400," We need to build the reader."
6418400,6419300," Okay."
6419300,6421440," So, uh, here's an image."
6421440,6422500," So,"
6422500,6426780," I removed the W error, which makes sense, I think."
6426780,6428400," Um,"
6428600,6430880," So, here's the wire world."
6430880,6432520," Here's the wire world."
6432520,6434540," So, in here."
6434540,6436880," By default, it's paused."
6436880,6439240," I think it's a good idea to keep them paused by default."
6439240,6441500," But maybe not."
6441500,6442100," I don't know."
6442100,6444420," Because it's not particularly intuitive initially."
6444420,6446480," It's not particularly intuitive."
6446480,6448440," All right."
6448540,6453040," So, here is some other separate stuff."
6453040,6459340," Uh, uh, uh, uh, so there's that."
6459340,6463020," And in the core, yeah, there we go."
6463020,6465680," Uh, load."
6469680,6479480," Unite by 60 into wild world sim simulator."
6479480,6481040," Is that how I spell it?"
6481040,6481320," Simulator."
6481320,6482480," Yeah, this is how I spell it."
6482480,6483340," Okay."
6483340,6484540," So, I'm gonna push that."
6484540,6486000," Um,"
6486000,6492440," It would be kind of nice to, like, have a little bit more structured thing in here."
6492440,6495980," With different, um,"
6499160,6502220," With different screenshots and whatnot."
6502220,6504780," But I'm not sure how to implement that."
6504780,6505160," So,"
6505160,6507640," Uh,"
6507640,6509660," All right."
6509660,6513580," So, I'm gonna mark, uh, not gonna probably mark it."
6513580,6515020," So, let me push that right into the repo."
6515020,6518340," So, it should be available, uh, at here."
6518340,6521720," And, uh,"
6521720,6523280," It's gonna be"
6523280,6525300," Automator."
6525300,6526360," There we go."
6528640,6530800," So, here are images."
6530800,6533100," Images of different life-like."
6533100,6534680," Holy shit."
6534680,6535900," I'm so dyslexic."
6535900,6537160," I, I,"
6537160,6538780," Oh my god."
6538780,6542000," I look at this and I realize how fucking dumb I was yesterday."
6542000,6542980," Holy shit."
6542980,6546040," Makes me feel so fucking bad."
6546040,6549900," Like, I really need to visit a doctor."
6549900,6550580," What the fuck?"
6552700,6554040," It was just fucking unsettling."
6554040,6554080," It was just fucking unsettling."
6554080,6556100," Anyway."
6556100,6556480," Um,"
6556480,6557100," Um,"
6557100,6580420," So, yeah, let's, let's first move the code that loads the state of the board into a separate function that is part of the live framework."
6580420,6588520," And once we do that, once we do that, uh, let's implement the opposite one that dumps, uh, the current state as an image."
6588520,6591880," Uh, so to do that, we'll need us to be right image, right?"
6592580,6595620," So, we need us to be right image as well."
6595620,6610980," Um, so, uh, nothings has to be, let's find this to be right."
6610980,6616160," I really want to also fix this, uh, like as to be warnings because they're kind of annoying."
6616160,6617940," All right."
6617940,6620340," And the kind of."
6620340,6632600," Okay."
6632720,6650060," So, why world, so in a wire world, I suppose we're going to have a, a function, right?"
6650060,6655460," Um, something like life load board from image, right?"
6655460,6657440," Life, uh, load board from image."
6658160,6661240," And you provide the board, right?"
6661240,6667400," You just provide the pointer to the board and you provide the, uh, pointer to the file path, right?"
6667400,6669200," So here's the file path."
6669200,6672920," But on top of that, you also need to provide the colors, right?"
6672920,6675020," The colors to properly parse everything."
6675520,6680540," So, and we're going to do a similar trick as we did in the live framework itself, right?"
6680540,6683100," So, uh, let's go."
6683100,6689120," So, you provide the amount of colors and then you provide an array of colors."
6689120,6692960," So, we're going to use the same array to parse things."
6692960,6702060," So, essentially, we use the same colors to parse, display, and dump the states of the game."
6702500,6704080," Which is actually kind of cool."
6704080,6707280," Yes, we're going to use the same thing."
6707280,6709320," So, here we're going to do cells count."
6709320,6717240," Um, and then, uh, we do const caller, cells caller, and we use the cells, uh, cells count in here."
6717240,6719060," You see, this is the trick I was talking about."
6719060,6724640," I'm actually using this trick from C99, which allows you to pass a variable here."
6724640,6728020," And then, uh, we use this variable in the type definition of an array."
6728020,6732500," And the compiler generates the code that appropriately calculates the offsets and stuff like that."
6732500,6733740," This is actually very convenient."
6733740,6738460," Uh, but I mean, for this particular case, it doesn't need to be, like, it doesn't require any offsets."
6738460,6738920," But, yeah."
6741920,6743940," Uh, I didn't know about that."
6743940,6744260," Yeah."
6744260,6746960," So, but it doesn't check it at compile time."
6746960,6750800," At compile time, this is just a pointer anyway."
6750800,6752880," It's just a pointer anyway."
6752880,6761120," Uh, but you, you can just use that at least to document, uh, what kind of size of the array is expected."
6761120,6763620," Uh, I mean, it says count."
6763620,6764700," It has to be count, of course."
6764700,6766860," Uh, expected."
6766860,6767500," Right."
6767500,6771980," Uh, all right."
6771980,6773580," So, and in here, we do what?"
6773580,6778820," Uh, we load things up like that."
6778820,6780260," Right."
6780260,6783320," So, we have, uh, let me call this WNH."
6783320,6785720," So, it's going to be WNH."
6785720,6787680," I think it's a little bit better that way."
6787680,6789320," At least, I like it better."
6789320,6791100," Uh, right."
6791120,6797080," And then here, um, we're going to say that we expect, I think I already have that."
6797080,6799740," Uh, I'm going to just move all of these things in here."
6799740,6801300," Uh, right."
6801300,6803080," This one is going to be W."
6803080,6804760," This one is going to be H."
6804760,6808380," Uh, we don't need any of that stuff."
6808380,6811060," Uh, right."
6811060,6812720," Any of that stuff."
6812720,6816420," Maybe we don't even need this stuff in here."
6816420,6818380," I think we don't need even that."
6818380,6821100," So, and up to that."
6821120,6825560," Um, I'm taking this entire loop."
6825560,6828240," Taking this entire loop."
6828240,6829740," And there we go."
6829740,6831920," So, yeah."
6831920,6833400," So, we have colors."
6833400,6835240," We have different colors."
6835240,6839500," And now we need to iterate through them."
6839500,6840500," And assign things accordingly."
6840500,6841280," And assign things accordingly."
6841280,6844220," Oh, by the way."
6844220,6845460," This is actually so."
6845460,6850160," Uh, why didn't I think about that?"
6850160,6850920," Thank you so much."
6850920,6853220," Um, where did I put it?"
6853220,6854240," I put it in live."
6854240,6857460," Uh, also."
6857460,6861200," Uh, try all three."
6861560,6861940," All right."
6861940,6863320," Try all three."
6863320,6865240," That's also a pretty good idea."
6865240,6866660," Thank you."
6866660,6867280," Thank you so much."
6867700,6871720," So, this could be one of the things that we can try to, you know, speed things up."
6871720,6872860," Speed the simulation up."
6872860,6873560," All three."
6873560,6876460," Um, should help a little bit."
6878860,6880760," But then, yeah."
6880760,6884880," We probably will be able to go further than that."
6884880,6886400," Okay."
6886400,6887580," So, in here, what we need to do."
6887580,6889180," We need to iterate through all of the colors."
6889180,6891100," So, we're going to have like a cell."
6891100,6894460," Uh, cells equal to zero."
6894460,6896900," Then cell less than cell count."
6896900,6897400," I think."
6897400,6898840," Is it cell count or cells count?"
6898840,6899820," Yes."
6899820,6900820," I called it cells count."
6900820,6902180," It's pretty inconsistent."
6902180,6903740," There's nothing you can do about that."
6903740,6905540," Uh, plus plus cell."
6905840,6916340," And now, cell, cell scholar, uh, cell scholar, cell, if, that's quite important."
6916340,6932500," If this thing is equal to that, well, that means the board cell in here, the board cell should be equal to cell like this."
6932500,6935400," And then we break out of that specific loop."
6935840,6936060," Right."
6936060,6937780," We'll break out of that specific loop."
6937780,6950960," Um, and, interestingly enough, interestingly enough, if we never encountered, so we also need to report an error if we encountered unknown color."
6950960,6954540," I think we should loudly break, but maybe not."
6954540,6956420," Maybe we should just, should just ignore it."
6958020,6970680," Uh, so how can we ignore it?"
6970680,6978980," Um, so let's introduce something like boolean found, and it's going to be false, and found true."
6979640,6981460," And, um, you know what?"
6981460,6982740," We can even do something like this."
6982740,6987820," While found, uh, while not found, right?"
6987820,6997380," So, while not found, and if not found, uh, we can say that we encountered a very weird color that we never saw before."
6999380,7002380," Yes, so, uh, it's going to be fprintf."
7002380,7010100," Uh, so we can also provide the, the file path unknown color."
7010100,7017280," Uh, it's going to be 0x, uh, actually 0x, 0x, 0x, 0x."
7018000,7023560," Uh, and then we're going to just exit with 1, let it go."
7023560,7025740," All right, I'll provide the file path."
7025740,7031300," File path, and, uh, the color itself, right?"
7031300,7032940," So, the color itself is here."
7032940,7038120," Um, might as well actually maybe extract that to a separate variable."
7038120,7038920," Who knows?"
7038920,7044160," Uh, so this could be something like color, color, like this."
7044280,7048800," So, we can take this entire thing and just replace it like so."
7048800,7050640," And, there we go."
7050640,7052180," So, we have it like that."
7052180,7057300," So, now it uses the same colors, which is kind of nice."
7057300,7062020," So, um, we have that."
7062020,7065740," And then we can do live load board from image."
7065740,7067060," We provide the pointer to the board."
7067060,7068860," Then we provide cell count."
7068860,7070660," And then we provide cell colors."
7070660,7073440," Uh, cell color."
7073440,7076560," And here we provide argv 1."
7076560,7077260," And there we go."
7077260,7080080," We have a special function that allows us to do all that stuff."
7080080,7081080," Isn't that amazing?"
7081080,7082300," I think it's goddamn amazing."
7082300,7086680," Um, all righty."
7086680,7091380," Um, so."
7091380,7098000," Uh, let me try to compile this entire stuff and see if it actually works."
7098520,7099840," Uh, it doesn't compile."
7099840,7104500," Uh, because it's a file path."
7104500,7105580," All right."
7105580,7110060," So, file path and, uh, here."
7110060,7112500," It's a file path again."
7112500,7118340," Uh, and now, what else?"
7118340,7119660," Uh, shit."
7121840,7125800," Uh, and, uh, oh my god."
7125800,7129860," So, these warnings in STB are extremely goddamn annoying."
7129860,7130680," Holy fuck."
7130680,7131960," Maybe I should fix them."
7131960,7134600," Uh, let me try to fix them."
7134600,7137360," Because, like, nothings."
7137360,7139640," Please merge that pull request."
7139720,7143160," Maybe I should actually, uh, ping him."
7143160,7148220," Um, STB, maybe nothings STB."
7148220,7154200," Um, maybe I should ping him or compare."
7154200,7155900," I'm pretty sure he's never gonna respond."
7156000,7159260," Because it, he basically ignores everything."
7159260,7163100," Which is, I mean, I'm not, not actually blaming him for that."
7163100,7167220," Because, um, he maintains a pretty popular open source project."
7167220,7169000," So, it's probably extremely overwhelming."
7169000,7173960," Uh, compiler warning."
7174240,7175940," Okay, so, maybe I'm gonna do that manually."
7175940,7183500," I'll just, I'm gonna, um, um, some data was corrupted somewhere."
7183500,7188740," Okay, so, we're taking size of another size."
7188740,7192400," So, that means it should be relatively safe to convert it directly to int."
7192400,7195640," Uh, to convert it directly to int."
7195640,7197260," And, let's do it like this."
7197260,7199580," So, is it gonna work?"
7199580,7200840," Oh, shit, it worked."
7200840,7203220," Variable set, but not used."
7203940,7206700," Okay, so, that means I can comment it out."
7206700,7209220," We have unused variable."
7209220,7211240," Okay."
7211240,7213320," Wait."
7213320,7215360," It is used."
7215360,7220140," What the fuck?"
7220140,7222840," GCC."
7222840,7230260," Fucking GCC."
7230260,7231280," Holy shit."
7231280,7233160," Trash compiler."
7233480,7234020," Straight up."
7234020,7238580," It's probably bug in the compiler."
7238580,7247720," Yeah, Clang doesn't complain."
7247720,7252260," But, uh, also, uh, it, it has, yeah, Clang doesn't complain."
7252260,7256220," But, Clang has a different bug that makes complain about this shit."
7256220,7257900," It's also a bug, by the way."
7257900,7260800," This is a bug, uh, of Clang."
7260800,7262480," Of the old version of Clang that I'm using."
7262760,7269020," So, do we have a single, non-buggy C compiler in 2021?"
7269020,7273320," I don't need to report that bug."
7273320,7275940," Because it was already fixed in later versions of Clang."
7275940,7278140," So, it's just..."
7278140,7280940," Oh, I mean, I just need to update the Clang."
7280940,7283580," But updating Clang on my machine is a pain in the ass."
7283580,7284880," So, let's just don't do that."
7286140,7288520," Um, God fucking damn it."
7288520,7297040," Anyways, so I'm gonna use Clang."
7297040,7299520," Okay, so now it complains."
7300680,7302520," Uh, okay, so assert and..."
7302520,7304520," Um..."
7304520,7307140," It's not equal to 4, really?"
7307140,7309480," That's, that's very strange."
7309480,7310640," Um..."
7310640,7313020," Oh, this is because it doesn't exist, I think."
7313020,7314140," Um..."
7314140,7315640," Uh, yeah, and we have to do it like that."
7315640,7317380," We have to actually put it here."
7317380,7321080," Yesu, yesu, yesu, yesu."
7321080,7322860," Okay, why do you couldn't read file?"
7322860,7324240," No such file or directory."
7324240,7325220," Exactly."
7326040,7327880," Images and..."
7327880,7330040," Unknown caller."
7330040,7331260," Oh."
7331260,7332340," Oh shit."
7332340,7333580," Oh fuck."
7333580,7334460," Oh shit."
7334460,7335160," Oh fuck."
7335160,7338360," Uh..."
7338360,7339720," Sorry, mon, mon, mon, mon."
7339720,7340260," Welcome."
7340260,7341180," How are you doing?"
7341180,7344620," Welcome to the streamers."
7344620,7346360," Oh shit."
7346360,7347060," Oh fuck."
7347060,7347920," Oh fuck."
7347920,7348560," Oh shit."
7348560,7348960," Okay."
7348960,7350960," Um..."
7350960,7351940," So, empty."
7351940,7356020," But we also need some sort of, like, an actual map."
7356040,7365520," all right we need an actual mapping so I think we need to have like a second cell"
7365520,7376480," color and this one is gonna be a parse color and this one essentially uses this"
7376480,7392440," stuff where we have zero zero zero zero maybe like ff zero zero zero zero I need to yeah I need to take"
7392440,7400060," that and just do the mapping from that so this sparse color empty is gonna be that so zero zero"
7400060,7410260," zero zero zero so head is gonna be ff which is correct a tail is gonna be that which is correct"
7410260,7420940," and conductor conductor is gonna be that which is also correct okay so and instead of using cell"
7420940,7428320," color when we're loading things up we're gonna use parse color hopefully that will make me make the"
7428320,7443620," thing to work yeah there we go look what we've done that's cool so basically it's a seller automaton"
7443620,7457660," that emulates the circuits right and we loaded the circuit from a gif file yes we loaded the circuit"
7457660,7466960," from a gif file uh yep that's pretty cool no good one and by the way I think yeah I think I'm gonna"
7466960,7472960," keep this course like that uh yeah so what we implemented essentially we implemented the wire"
7472960,7480220," world right so we implemented the wire world uh it looks like this all right so here's the description"
7480220,7490720," of this particular cellular automaton uh please it's super simple right seriously it's just a cell like"
7490720,7498640," a game of life but with a cell with four states right and then we found uh the following image the"
7498640,7505120," following image uh of a circuit uh that implements some sort of like a counter and we parsed this image"
7505120,7512080," directly pixel by pixel interpreting each pixel as a cell and we loaded it into our interpreter and"
7512080,7517420," uh we simulated it and simulation appears to be working it appears to be working so we're just"
7517420,7523120," refactoring this kind of stuff so we're loading the state of this thing directly from an image and that's"
7523120,7530380," pretty cool um yeah we're using this to be uh library to load images but it seems to be working"
7530380,7539680," that's cool it is pretty cool not gonna lie um all right so and I'm what I'm doing now I'm generalizing"
7539680,7546080," the ability of loading images as the states of the game so we can use it for other games for example we"
7546080,7551680," have other games implemented like Brian's brain for example it looks like this right it's almost like"
7551680,7563680," game of life but prayer uh yes with transgender transgender colors uh so what's cool about this particular uh"
7563680,7570640," uh seller automata automaton is that chaos generates pretty interesting patterns"
7570640,7579040," case generates pretty interesting patterns uh all righty so let me see what we have here"
7579040,7586560," uh so yeah I want to actually commit everything I want to actually commit everything so uh this one is going"
7586560,7593280," to be fix stb warnings fixes to be warnings this one is going to be"
7593280,7603600," did I actually commit too much oh yeah okay so what I wanted essentially I wanted to move this function"
7603600,7614560," into the framework so we can reuse that right we can reuse that uh now so we have yeah like this"
7616560,7621920," we don't have to worry about that uh the next function I want to implement it the fun is the function"
7621920,7630080," that actually save the saves the current state to the file right saves the current state to the file"
7630080,7633440," and the question is how can we do that"
7633440,7644800," um all right so let's quickly implement that so I want to be able to take the state of uh for example bb as"
7644800,7654400," a brian's brain and uh save it to the final as well to png um okay so it's gonna be life dump board maybe"
7654400,7662400," save as an opposite to load save board to uh image right it's gonna be um it's gonna take this const board"
7662400,7670720," but unfortunately it also will need um a buffer it will also need a buffer where we're gonna save all of"
7670720,7680080," that right so yeah const char file path uh and we also need to take the cells count"
7680080,7689280," cells count and the colors that we want to use for the states of the cells right for the states of the cells"
7690480,7699440," cells count all right and um okay"
7699440,7708400," choosing the format is not a problem holy you're focusing on wrong problems"
7708400,7715840," uh so we need like a static thingy here so let's introduce like a static view in 32"
7716400,7722480," uh data and the data is going to be rows and columns right rows and columns and it's going to be like"
7722480,7729120," this so the first thing uh we're going to do is just to convert everything oh i need to make a small"
7729120,7736240," break chat i really need to make a small break um maybe maybe smaller i'm not sure but i really need to"
7736240,7750240," to make a small break fun"
7766240,7780240," uh so um"
7780240,7785600," so"
7785600,7799600," uh"
7815600,7843520," hey yo what's up epic gamers let's go all right so let's iterate the rows"
7844880,7848880," starting from zero row less rows a plus plus plus"
7848880,7855760," uh plus plus row then it's going to be a call zero call calls"
7855760,7865120," plus cool epic tomatoes yes and uh since we have this data i can just assign that so this actually"
7865120,7872720," makes it kind of not uh thread safe right because it's essentially a global variable but it's hidden from"
7872720,7880720," anyone else but it could be messed up if you actually run this function from several threats"
7880720,7885280," but do we are we going to run it from so that i don't think so even if we parallelize the rendering"
7885280,7892000," of um like of calculating the next state we're probably going to have like a pool of workers"
7892000,7899120," that just basically modify the board itself but they are all going to be synchronized when uh i"
7899120,7905680," need to save the board to the file so it shouldn't be that big of a problem in my opinion uh so it's"
7905680,7911920," going to be rows and columns and what we're doing here we're just taking the board uh cells row and"
7911920,7917440," column and we're mapping it to the colors it's themselves color like this there we go that's"
7917440,7924400," pretty cool um so and what we need to do here we just need to save it now right nothing nothing"
7924400,7929840," particularly special we just need to save it it's probably going to be saved in the correct in"
7929840,7938080," incorrect format uh but maybe that means i'll have to refactor some of my code all right so i have a"
7938080,7945280," special function called a library stb image right so speaking of what is difficult to read or write"
7945280,7950320," we're using the library to manipulate library to to manipulate images so it's not that big of a problem"
7950880,7956560," uh so what i'm using is i'm using stb image which is like a single header library that lets me read"
7956560,7964080," and write images uh so it is not a problem so thank you so much now thanks for implementing all of that"
7964080,7971680," um stb image right yeah stb is absolutely great i use it all the time when i need to manipulate images"
7971680,7979920," or just quickly dump some like some data as an image is just perfect for that uh right stb image"
7979920,7990480," right uh right so we have it like that has to be image uh yeah there we go so we can write it as png"
7990480,7999440," as bmp stga as jpeg hgr whatever so i think i'm gonna use the uh png i think pngs should be should work"
7999440,8006320," for this particular case uh save so we already prepared the data and let's just save that data"
8006320,8012720," so we're going to be saving it to file path uh file path width is going to be the amount of columns"
8012720,8017680," height is going to be rows the amount of components is going to be four for this particular case and"
8017680,8026640," i'm going to provide the data that we just prepared strident bytes is essentially calls uh but multiplied by"
8026640,8032000," four right so yeah the amount of components is four and this is going to be the thing and i don't"
8032000,8042720," remember what exactly it returns in case of an error um so uh maybe we can find implementation okay uh"
8042720,8053760," all right so it returns one in case of success i suppose right if we hit this particular place that"
8053760,8062000," means we succeeded i think yeah yeah so in case of an error here we free everything and return zero so"
8062000,8070640," that means uh one is a success if not this thing uh we can report an error saying that uh oopsie doopsie you"
8070640,8087280," did a fucky wacky uh error could not save to file s because of s uh file path and uh so we're gonna use str error"
8087280,8092640," uh error no there we go and then we're gonna exit with one boom"
8093200,8102320," kill oh oh this is not what i wanted it was cool but this is not what i wanted so uh all right so what"
8102320,8107520," do we have and of course a goddamn classic warning"
8111920,8114800," uh all right uh all right another goddamn classic"
8114800,8121040," okay so here's the call"
8121040,8125120," uh anything else roll"
8125120,8132560," error no is undeclared so probably need to include it"
8134560,8143680," uh error no that h okay anything else stb image um implicit declaration of stbi"
8143680,8147600," ah well it's not an implicit declaration"
8147600,8153760," ah i see so we need to do it like this"
8156800,8159440," yeah yeah as well actually put it like that"
8159440,8165520," delay size"
8165520,8171120," okay so and i need to use clang because of that"
8171120,8178880," all right might as well actually parallelize that in five threads"
8178880,8185520," so to make it a little bit faster because clang compiles slower than"
8186400,8195520," uh than gcc for some reason uh redefinition of stb sse available we have a redefinition already oh i know"
8195520,8203360," why because why uh why world actually also includes this kind of stuff so we need to remove it from here"
8203360,8209680," yeah"
8214400,8222080," cool cool cool okay let's implement something interesting uh in live.h right"
8222080,8236960," so we reset the board when you press r right uh if square core keyboard you press let's say"
8236960,8243600," s right you press s it should save the current state of the board to the"
8244720,8249520," file of some of some sort but the question is how is going to save uh where is going to save that"
8249520,8257040," so i think um it should actually accept the file path as a parameter so"
8257040,8267120," save file path something like this right so basically the um the implementation itself will tell"
8267120,8273920," where exactly where exactly to put that and uh now i'm going to grab this entire stuff right grab this"
8273920,8283760," entire stuff and i'm going to put it here uh like this uh to be fair we could also make a pretty"
8283760,8290000," interesting thing well maybe we can do that later so the board we need to take the the current board"
8290000,8298560," context uh board uh context boards uh context boards current or board current i don't remember yeah"
8298560,8301600," board current so file path is going to be"
8304160,8313920," um save um save file path cells count we do have the cells count in context cells count and uh in"
8313920,8324160," the context cells count we have this thing so that should be so every time um you try to save"
8326800,8332080," every time you every time you press s it actually saves it to the um to the file system so let's see"
8332080,8338560," how it's going to work uh does it compile it does not even compile properly context"
8339520,8347760," uh board parameter so it has to be a pointer i see so uh it failed specifically in the wire world but maybe"
8347760,8360080," uh okay so what do we have here so in the bb is going to be bb png uh then in another one this"
8360080,8364640," one is going to be gold png depending on different games we're going to save them differently"
8365200,8374000," so why world uh png anything else and here seeds seeds png there we go"
8374000,8377840," so we're going to be reusing that in several places"
8377840,8386400," okay so now we don't have any png files in here right so i try to find them they don't exist i'm"
8386400,8394640," gonna try to run bb oh yeah that's very interesting so this is because it was"
8394640,8402560," too big let me try to run it one more time yeah it is very slow but that's very cool as well"
8402560,8411440," okay so i'm gonna go to the um square and i'm gonna reduce this entire stuff to just 100"
8411440,8415680," all right so i'm gonna just reduce it to 100 i'm gonna rebuild everything"
8418720,8425200," i'm gonna rebuild everything it would be kind of cool to actually set the size of the board according"
8425200,8432800," to like the image that we're loading uh i think it would be kind of nice uh but it probably will take"
8432800,8438960," too much time too much time to implement uh all right so i'm gonna uh save it right now i'm pressing s"
8439520,8446240," and it failed could not read file read i wasn't reading it though"
8446240,8455520," um no such file or directory okay so when i press s uh let's go to the what to the life.h"
8456160,8462800," here is s oh i want it's safe yes that makes sense okay i need to rebuild everything"
8465600,8484400," uh uh and define the reference save board to to image okay i'm sorry save board to image"
8489520,8498240," so i can stop it now and you can save it then i go here and okay that's very interesting so let"
8498240,8504480," me open it in the chromium so here's the image but the colors are completely up"
8504480,8512160," probably because a png like has to be expected in a completely different in a completely different"
8512160,8519440," order or whatnot what's interesting is that i'm pretty sure we can uh then use this image"
8519520,8527200," in wire world uh right in wire world uh like this bbpng uh and"
8527200,8534560," it has a no yeah it has a known colors yeah the colors are not standardized but"
8534560,8541200," yeah but it it actually saved it it actually saved it uh if you can if you can see that so here's the"
8541200,8545600," the state that we saved as an image"
8545600,8552320," so but now we need to think how to properly do the colors and whatnot"
8552320,8563200," because i originally choose the wrong order of the of the channels and now i'm gonna get fucked by it"
8568640,8575600," i'm gonna get fucked by it so it would be kind of cool to have like a colors uh that are sort of"
8575600,8582240," channel encoding channel independent but uh maybe not for now maybe not for now"
8582240,8590240," all right so that was an interesting idea so maybe i'm gonna work on it a little bit later at some point"
8592880,8601200," uh all right so let me save all of that and also let me get ignore any png files in here"
8601200,8619040," implement saving state functionality for saving state functionality for"
8620400,8626240," live framework"
8626240,8628160," so um"
8628160,8648880," let's try to see if we can speed up the wire world right so wire world uh let me do the following thing"
8648880,8656720," where i'm gonna just use it like that it's gonna be eight uh well this one has to be 600 right this"
8656720,8658080," has to be 600 and"
8658080,8663440," i'm gonna rebuild everything just in case"
8663440,8668160," i really hate this warning but i cannot do anything"
8668160,8676400," unused but set variable it is used oh my god it's so dumb holy and it's it's used down there"
8677280,8685120," it's it's it's literally used down there holy fuck it's so dumb gcc is so goddamn dumb all right so um"
8685120,8689920," wire world and uh images"
8689920,8692160," okay"
8692160,8696880," okay so here is this thing and let me see if we can"
8698000,8706160," speed it up just by enabling enabling all three so is if is always all three will be enough for that"
8706160,8712480," it will probably slow down completion of everything in here but we'll see let's see"
8712480,8718160," okay it actually compiled faster than i expected it's kind of sus"
8719760,8738480," no it doesn't compile faster okay so it's actually still compiling all right let's wait it's still"
8738480,8744560," it's probably tries to optimize like the stb image uh stb headers as well"
8744560,8754640," holy that's that took quite some time holy it's like full optimization including the stb libraries"
8754640,8760000," right stb libraries required like a separate optimization and stuff like that holy"
8760000,8766400," fuck okay so let's see if the wire world became faster uh so maybe maybe it did"
8766400,8768560," um"
8772720,8782960," it kind of became faster but not really"
8784720,8796960," yeah not really"
8796960,8812960," next three pixels please"
8814720,8818640," which compression goes right okay i see"
8818640,8829920," all right uh so it's probably going to take a lot of time by the way did i compile this in test"
8829920,8836000," yeah okay so let's actually try with clank let's try with clank maybe clank is going to do a better"
8836000,8837680," job at optimizing everything"
8837680,8848960," the next thing we can try to do is to simulate several steps um per frame"
8848960,8854640," which shouldn't be that difficult it's just"
8854640,8856640," yeah"
8861520,8865840," but that should be done on a whole new level if you think about it"
8865840,8869440," it should be done on a whole new level"
8869440,8879840," so essentially"
8879840,8885760," we usually in in event loop we return true or false"
8886560,8894160," uh indicating that uh you should compute the next state or not so we need to refactor it into returning"
8894160,8897280," integer that tells you how many iterations you have to do"
8898480,8903600," yeah that's what it should be it will return you how many iterations you need to make to"
8903600,8910080," uh to accommodate for for the speed up and whatnot i think it's a pretty reasonable solution"
8910640,8919120," uh anyway so i just compiled with clank uh clank seemed to work uh so let's let's put it like this"
8919120,8924880," and i'm gonna speed up everything and it didn't really provide that much of a speed up in my opinion"
8924880,8928320," so that was that was kind of man but"
8929920,8938240," yeah"
8938240,8945280," okay so uh but i'm gonna actually uh clean that as well"
8945280,8948480," uh all right um"
8948480,8957280," enable all three and i'm gonna just push that right into the ribbon all right so let me see so we"
8958320,8963360," make a decision whether to compute the next generation at the level of the core framework"
8963360,8965600," right at the level of the core framework"
8965600,8968720," we have"
8968720,8978800," next gen timeout and next gen cooldown right so and the places where we use all of that"
8978800,8980480," the places where we use all of that"
8981920,8987280," yeah there we go so core is next gen so we basically check whether"
8987280,8992480," we need to uh compute the next generation or not"
8998800,8999840," so and then"
8999840,9005440," that's pretty cool yes"
9005440,9016080," so essentially uh once we become once this thing becomes less than zero we just reset the cooldown"
9016080,9017520," we just reset the cooldown"
9017520,9026000," uh furthermore um i think we need to put it behind the pose right if it's not posed only then we do all of"
9026000,9035120," these checks uh only then we do all of these checks but uh it's kind of hard to tell"
9035120,9041680," so essentially"
9041680,9048720," we need to be able to have a counter right we need to be able to have a counter"
9049760,9064800," uh so in the context we're going to have next gen count next gen count and essentially"
9064800,9071600," next gen so this is going to be kind of complicated this is going to be kind of complicated but"
9071600,9081440," uh if it works out doesn't matter um it works out doesn't matter um it works out doesn't matter"
9081440,9092960," so the counter is next gen okay so we are extracting next gen count right and essentially what we are"
9092960,9100640," returning here uh we are returning the results we're turning the result which is the context"
9102160,9104240," next gen count"
9104240,9111760," like this and then i reset next gen count"
9111760,9121040," to zero next gen count to zero so once you get it it gets resets uh all right then"
9124160,9133120," uh here is the interesting thing if it's less or equal than zero we reset it to timeout"
9133120,9136960," we reset it to timeout"
9139840,9142000," uh-huh and we can do it something like this okay"
9142000,9154960," so we are about to subtract the delta um the delta time from the cooldown the delta time from the"
9154960,9169680," cooldown uh if the cooldown cooldown is less than delta time in seconds we have to actually kind of take"
9170480,9178000," the delta time in second and split by the cooldown right by the cooldown"
9178000,9183840," oh it actually depends it's actually all that depends"
9188080,9195280," so basically we have two modes of operation we have two modes of operation the first mode of"
9195280,9204000," operation is when the timeout is greater or equal to the delta time in seconds and in that case"
9204000,9210480," it's just super easy to do things like that right it's just super easy to do things like that"
9210480,9216080," otherwise if it's smaller we don't even use the cooldown anymore um"
9216080,9223760," if these things we have to do next gen count uh plus plus one so if it's"
9225120,9229040," less than that the timeout what we do essentially we do delta"
9229040,9240720," uh this we get the time out we get the time out we split it uh by the timeouts"
9240720,9247360," and i guess we can actually seal it maybe maybe floor fit it it depends on whether we want to do"
9247920,9257600," we want to do that exactly and then uh right we add that to the gen count so basically if the timeout is"
9257600,9266000," so small uh it will force the loops to compute several times um and i guess that's pretty much it"
9268080,9277760," oh that's pretty much it so that may work so let me see how well it will work so we're going to test on"
9277760,9285280," the rule one one oh is next gen so we don't have a next gen anymore and we have to do that in square"
9285280,9297680," damn it okay so is next gen is next gen next gen count and it's also next gen count"
9298080,9307360," so we're going to only rebuild rule one one one oh and see how it goes all right so what is it"
9307360,9316480," complaining about semicolon cool uh all right um essentially what we want to do we want to take this"
9316480,9323840," and save it save the count i'm going to save the count uh it's going to be constant like this and"
9325840,9335440," four size t less than count plus plus i and we just do it like that oh my god okay so it has to be like"
9335440,9343680," this there we go there we go and that should give us appropriate thing that should give us appropriate"
9343680,9354480," thing is next gen next gen count uh huh cool so let me see if it will go a little bit faster after that"
9355440,9366640," so i can actually um well that's very interesting but it doesn't really go that much faster unless we"
9366640,9378960," actually uh limit the minimum even further like 10 times slower so it's gonna mix my j5 uh is going to"
9378960,9385680," rule 110 something like that and i can make it even faster and we can probably move it even faster"
9385680,9390880," what are you doing"
9390880,9398320," it must be going fast but it doesn't even if i"
9398320,9402160," this is really affect anything"
9409280,9411200," it doesn't feel like it's affecting anything but"
9411200,9418480," it does well it slows down because of the rendering that's for sure it slows down because of"
9418480,9421200," the rendering maybe we can simply"
9421200,9431440," yeah i think the rendering is actually up maybe we need to keep track of the like dirty rectangles"
9431440,9434320," that needs to be redrawn if you know what i mean"
9434320,9446080," that could be a way to to speed up yeah so this is another interesting thing to to speed up stuff"
9446080,9449520," um so i'm gonna go to the life"
9452320,9459040," so we already tried oh three uh civil states per city stick we're currently trying it and uh here"
9459040,9471040," don't redraw uh cells that didn't change right so this could be a thing to speed up stuff as well"
9472160,9481840," but there's not much we can do about that because uh the core the core actually redraws uh like cleans up"
9481840,9485760," the like everything for us so there's nothing much we can do about it"
9488880,9493200," or can we that's a good question can we do something about that"
9493200,9504160," but yeah anyway so i'm gonna try to now rebuild game of life"
9505840,9513040," uh and see how that thing will go so we have a complaining about these things do we have a"
9513040,9514320," complaining about anything else"
9514320,9524560," yes it's working"
9524560,9534080," uh all right so count uh i'm gonna do it like this so even if we have uh well yeah we need to do it like"
9534080,9543680," this so it's gonna be context rule uh like that and it's gonna be size t count um"
9543680,9552400," next gen count you didn't step up for a bit you actually step up for a step away for for a really"
9552400,9557440," long time because it's been working for quite some time already um all right"
9557440,9563760," to the point that i couldn't be bothered to stop what i'm doing right now to show you"
9564560,9566960," because we're already like sick with working"
9566960,9574560," for two hours exactly we're like i i just cannot be bothered to uh stop what i'm doing to show you"
9574560,9580160," like literally because like it's been too much time already uh maybe if you're lucky maybe i'm gonna"
9580160,9584080," show it again well i definitely will show it again because what we're trying to do we're trying to speed"
9584080,9592800," it up um all right so we're gonna take the count um and we're just trying to simulate it for several ticks as"
9592800,9598720," well all right so is it gonna be working hopefully it's gonna be working"
9598720,9602800," yeah okay so it seems to be"
9610800,9617760," all right"
9617760,9619040," yeah it's very slow"
9619040,9630160," yeah i'm pretty sure it's because of the rendering rendering it kills like literally everything and"
9630160,9637280," in this particular case i think switching to shaders would be actually very beneficial"
9637280,9642400," because in that case like you remember the initial idea that i had of using like a texture"
9642400,9648240," uh for the shader i think it would be be cool"
9648240,9657600," yeah but it's too late anyway um okay several states per tick didn't work uh don't retrieve the cells that"
9657600,9664480," didn't change i think it's not gonna work for core uh let's actually try to see if wire world works"
9665760,9668080," so i'm gonna rebuild everything including wire world"
9668080,9675600," and uh will it speed it up i'm not sure i don't think it will be there but maybe it will"
9675600,9681920," uh because if the bottleneck is rendering if the bottleneck is rendering that means it"
9681920,9694240," should work um yes it should work"
9694240,9699360," it's just like a full optimization we're doing full optimization right now"
9702080,9712000," um okay so um then it's gonna be a wild world and i have to provide the image and"
9712000,9717360," uh there we go so this is how it looks like if you wanted to see"
9717360,9727440," so so the twitch encoding probably makes it unbearable to watch but this is basically how it looks like"
9728480,9731040," and it's working simulating this thing"
9731040,9735040," uh i think it's sped it up"
9735040,9742800," i think it did it definitely feels a little bit faster but still rendering of all that is just"
9744240,9745200," not particularly fast"
9745200,9756240," it's super cool i guess i guess it's kind of cool"
9756240,9764080," okay one of the things we can do we can actually take the board turn it into image"
9764800,9767760," turn it into surface right turn it into surface"
9767760,9770320," uh"
9770320,9776640," yeah and just render it as a surface that's one of the things we can do"
9776640,9782720," uh but that will require a completely different approach kill switch video yeah i know there's"
9782720,9789200," nothing much you can do about it so that's also an interesting idea that's also an interesting idea"
9790000,9795360," uh well don't withdraw cells that don't change it's uh kind of a kind of a man"
9795360,9806320," yeah what's up i'm dead who's writing then hello welcome how was your prologue adventures by the way"
9806320,9808800," how was your prologue adventures"
9810480,9820640," um so we've been doing that we're trying to speed this thing up"
9820640,9826320," i'm trying to speed this thing up and this is a seller automaton by the way"
9826320,9833040," this is an actual cellular automaton and it tries to like emulate a counter and whatnot"
9834000,9837600," and it's the wire world it's the actual wire world"
9837600,9843040," uh it's the one that was suggested on the stream so wire world"
9843040,9848880," yeah it literally kills the betray yeah i guess"
9848880,9856800," there's nothing much you can do about it this one uh basically game of life actually seeds it's not"
9856800,9863360," really game of life it's it's literally seeds by brian silverman but with four uh states of the cell"
9863360,9869440," right you have four states of the cell and you have conductors you have electrons and uh yeah we"
9869440,9877360," implemented that and it seems to be working seems to be working we also implemented a parser that can"
9877360,9884880," load this state of the seller automaton from an image right we found this image on on the internet"
9884880,9891120," and we using stb we just loaded it into our emulator and it seems to be working"
9892720,9896160," so yeah it's kind of cool it's kind of cool"
9896160,9904240," it was actually super easy to parse because each pixel represents the cell and cells with different"
9904240,9906880," colors represent different kind of cells so"
9906880,9915280," it's cool and we're trying to speed it up we're speeding it up it's actually pretty huge pain in this"
9915280,9919920," i have no idea how to speed it up well i have a couple of ideas uh we already tried like"
9920800,9929280," oh three um yeah so it essentially gives you transistors um"
9929280,9940240," which actually probably explains why there is like a interesting theory i suppose i heard at least that"
9940240,9945760," among the physicists there's there's a theory that the whole world is essentially like a simple"
9946400,9953040," cellular automaton with simple rules right so and everything we see around ourselves is basically"
9953040,9958720," emerging behavior of those rules and some people are trying to find those rules and know how much true"
9958720,9967280," it is let's have you ever done project with ai depends on the definition of ai what is ai"
9967280,9975200," and let me guess your answer you're gonna like literally translate me abbreviation it's telling me"
9975200,9987520," artificial intelligence right uh no or i don't know anyway uh so let me see because like it's kind of"
9987520,9992000," interesting i ask i've been asked this question so many times like a lot of people ask me have"
9992000,9997760," you ever done ai and the first question asked what is ai and the first answer to that they always say"
9997760,10004240," it's artificial intelligence like thank you holy that makes a lot of sense it's like it's also the"
10004240,10010080," same with op like every time i i ask what is op people say object-oriented programming yeah i"
10010080,10015040," i answer your question now you answer thank you cool"
10015040,10026160," i'm really sorry that they behave like that it's just like when you've been asked this question like"
10026160,10029920," hundreds of times it's just you cannot take this question seriously sorry"
10034480,10039040," that's okay"
10039040,10044560," i'm really sorry so that it behaves like that"
10044560,10052080," um oh shit okay so uh where is it"
10052080,10060080," withdrawal didn't change uh parallelization i think parallelization is going to be that particularly useful"
10062240,10065200," maybe it will be okay"
10065200,10079200," so essentially how do we render the um the board right how do we render it we are just"
10079200,10089600," uh render it uh cell by cell right we just render it cell by cell so in sdl we have an interesting thing"
10089600,10098800," called surface right so we have a surface um and we surface is basically an image in the memory and we can"
10098800,10109680," i think simply uh turn the surface into a texture and then render that texture like slap that texture"
10109680,10116960," onto the screen so this is one of the things we can do um and that could be a pretty cool optimization"
10116960,10122800," because that will not require scheduling a lot of rectangles to draw right it will not require"
10122800,10127520," scheduling a lot of rectangles to draw it will require schedule only one single surface to draw"
10127520,10135360," and hopefully that will be fast maybe we will be able to even modify like sdl texture directly on the fly"
10135360,10142080," but i'm not sure if it's possible so you can lock the texture and when you lock the texture what can you"
10142080,10153920," do with it you can modify the pixels okay um so as an optimization the pixels made available for editing"
10153920,10159200," do not necessarily contain the old texture data this is right on the operations and if you need to keep"
10159200,10166400," a copy this is actually perfect this is actually get them perfect because we can now allocate the texture"
10166400,10172800," right we can now allocate the texture of a specific size and every time you need to like render a"
10172800,10180880," specific uh rectangle there you can oh holy this is so goddamn cool i think we'll"
10180880,10186480," be able to optimize this chat to the roof right so we're gonna just keep a single texture um"
10189760,10196640," uh did did i ever so okay so the question was did i ever did any neural networks right if that's the"
10196640,10201840," question okay that's a good question by the way because at least neural networks have a very specific"
10201840,10207280," definition or like better definition than artificial intelligence right so i didn't do anything"
10207280,10212400," sophisticated with neural networks but i implemented a very simple neural network in husk does it count"
10213280,10221040," neural uh network i think it's somewhere there i need to find it uh neural network"
10221040,10228160," so it was a long time ago like two years ago but yeah"
10228160,10237280," uh on the topic of other artificial intelligence things i also did genetic programming so is that is that"
10237280,10244240," uh artificial intelligence because well it's not a neural network so that's why i asked what is"
10244240,10249520," artificial intelligence what do you mean by artificial intelligence so i also did genetic programming"
10249520,10258160," is that artificial intelligence i don't know uh to be fair in like in 70s in 1970"
10258160,10266480," uh any algorithm of traversing a graph were considered artificial intelligence so"
10268000,10273200," just finding like a shortest path in a graph could be also considered artificial intelligence like"
10273200,10278320," but by today by today's standards like nobody actually thinks of it as artificial intelligence"
10278320,10284720," right so what is artificial intelligence you see you see that's it's not really good term if you"
10284720,10289840," if you want to ask about this kind of stuff right it's better to always ask about specific"
10289840,10295600," techniques specific algorithms specific data structures like specific things because artificial"
10295600,10299600," intelligence it doesn't mean anything it doesn't mean anything it's a marketing bullshit right"
10299600,10304720," it's a marketing bullshit that is used to you know get money out of the investors because"
10304720,10310480," investors they just hear the word artificial intelligence and they're like oh artificial intelligence"
10310480,10314480," so but we are not investors we don't have money"
10314480,10322240," marketing bullshit doesn't work for us we have to we engineers we we talk in specific terms"
10322320,10328400," what's right um did you do big dick god damn it"
10328400,10335040," you got my point torunor i really appreciate it you got my point"
10335040,10339120," you got my point"
10339120,10348720," all right let's see"
10355760,10362800," okay so we need to now do a little bit of optimization uh luckily i abstracted everything"
10362800,10369760," away so we won't have to uh modify too many things hopefully we'll see"
10369760,10378320," so essentially how do we render everything we have a special function called square fill cell right square"
10378320,10380480," fill cell hello c 252"
10380480,10386080," i haven't seen you in a while by the way how are you doing uh hello hello"
10386080,10392000," so haven't you watched me for a while because i said something something dumb"
10392000,10398160," because that's usually the case quite often people just don't watch my stream for a while because they"
10399680,10409600," hear me say something dumb i don't know okay i'm really glad to hear that um okay bye bye see you"
10409600,10415680," see you around good luck with your prologue stuff machine learning feels kind of the same to me even"
10415680,10420400," though it feels less abstract than ai yeah it's also the same like marketing stuff"
10422400,10425120," i'm just being busy with the school interesting"
10425120,10430400," school"
10430400,10437360," i haven't been to schools for quite some time already and i kind of miss it to be fair"
10437360,10446160," it wasn't stupid question it was just like not really informed one i wouldn't say it's stupid"
10450080,10456720," all right you're welcome i suppose so here we have a special function that"
10456720,10464960," basically accepts rows and columns and color and what it does it just calls core fill erect"
10464960,10469040," that's what it does it just calls call fill erect and"
10469040,10475440," luckily i think i don't use this function anywhere except here so"
10478080,10481120," yes that's perfect so this is a perfect abstraction so once i"
10481120,10488960," remove it nobody's going to complain about it that's actually perfect so the only problem we see"
10488960,10495120," here is the grid but that shouldn't affect anything either all right so what we have here we need to"
10495120,10503200," allocate sdl texture so this is going to be board texture uh and it's going to be pointed to the texture"
10503200,10512320," q rule uh how can i create the texture so uh let me let me see so again uh how we uh render everything"
10512320,10518800," right now right now we're literally scheduling rendering of a rectangle for each individual cell"
10518800,10525440," that's how we do that which is extremely slow because it yeah it overwhelms sdl and by the way sdl"
10525440,10531920," also allocates a lot of memory on each scheduling of the rectangle so it's a mess so what i want to do now i"
10531920,10539040," want to allocate a single texture render the state of the board into the texture and then just uh render"
10539040,10545040," the whole texture as a single like like a draw call i suppose i don't know how many draw calls sdl does"
10545040,10552560," and in theory it should optimize everything hopefully so let's create the texture so we can you can even"
10552560,10559680," create a texture with a specific format all right vegetables are you eating eating vegetables right now"
10559680,10573680," i wouldn't mind vegetables actually um interesting thing about vegetables i absolutely love broccoli"
10573680,10582480," and you you know why you know why because when i was a child we didn't have them in the place where i"
10582480,10589200," lived uh when i was a child broccoli were never a thing so i was never forced to eat them when i was a"
10589200,10602800," child i only tried them when i was around 20. so and i really like them i think it's kind of a thing like i think a lot of people in us or europe absolutely hate them because they were"
10602800,10608080," were forced to eat them when they were children and the same thing goes with for example pascal"
10608080,10616800," in uh in russia for example or in eastern european countries right because um people are forced to"
10616800,10622400," learn pascal in schools there and since people are forced to do that they absolutely hate that language"
10623200,10633040," so yeah for some children to do things is the best yeah exactly and there's so many evidence for that there's so many evidence um yeah"
10633040,10642160," and the people keep hating those things until the rest of their life actually it all starts from the childhood"
10643520,10649200," um celery a tomato cooking with studying by the way i know about hello how are you doing really glad to see"
10649200,10657760," pascal is cool yes and you know why i like pascal i was never forced to actually program it in school"
10657760,10663920," it was kind of interesting i discovered the pascal for myself a year before they started to teach us"
10664800,10672080," in school so i discovered it myself i liked it i learned it and then next year we started to do it"
10672080,10678320," in school and because i already knew it and because i already like it i was never actually forced to do"
10678320,10683920," that you were first and do you hate it do you hate pascal you probably do and that actually makes sense to"
10683920,10688400," me so i think people should never be forced to to to program in basket"
10688400,10701120," even though semantically it is not that different from c actually uh but you program in c just fine so"
10701920,10705120," what's what do you see and i don't hate c interesting"
10705120,10713920," yeah i have a bad things i assume it makes sense it also all depends on the uh on the teacher that you"
10713920,10720720," had uh right so if the teacher was an right so you might also especially hate pascal"
10720720,10725200," i hate pascal broken"
10725200,10731600," yeah and there's nothing wrong with that so i don't think there's nothing wrong there's anything"
10731600,10740960," wrong with that um all right so we do square begin and we also need to create everything in here"
10740960,10749120," all right so it's gonna be context and board texture"
10749120,10759760," i really want to eat something and be with hungry chat chat feed me i'm hungry"
10762080,10768560," uh all right constex core renderer we provide the renderer and the question is what kind of formats"
10768560,10778480," can we have want some chocolate i wouldn't mind i'll be kind of cool i haven't had chocolate for"
10778480,10784320," quite some time so the thing about dark chocolate is that um you can eat it for a while and then you"
10784320,10790160," get sick of it and then you don't eat it for quite some time and i think uh i'm almost at the point that i"
10790160,10796240," want to start eating dark chocolate yet again so yeah i think i'm gonna bite soon"
10796240,10803120," that's how all sweets for me but i don't really eat sweets that's the thing about it i"
10803760,10813440," eat dark chocolate like 97 percent or higher that contains almost no sugar um as a matter of fact i"
10813440,10821280," don't eat anything sweet at all because i'm because i was trying to lose weight i already lost weight and"
10821280,10830560," now it became a habit so i cannot eat sweet anything anymore yes uh i like pascal tuber pascal 7"
10830560,10837760," specifically pirated copy at the time running compiled code lightning fast even on the flop exactly so"
10837760,10845520," here's the problem so the computers in 2021 are perceptually slower way slower than they were before"
10846640,10856080," right they're actually super computer but perceptually they become slower and slower and because of the"
10856080,10863040," software software actually tracks the performance down so software makes the computer slower then they"
10863040,10872240," become they then they become faster so it's just insane how turbo pascal was blazing fast from a floppy disk"
10875520,10881120," and 2020 uh 2021 we cannot render draw like dom fast enough for which website"
10881120,10888320," uh pirate youtube of pascal 7 classic we had it at school yeah so at the time like i mean"
10888320,10893280," russian schools pirate a lot of software but don't tell anyone"
10896800,10906400," uh yeah primarily because they they cannot afford stuff that shadow x thank you so much for six months"
10906400,10912880," of tier one subscription thank you thank you thank you and welcome to epic pascal clan uh so what i"
10912880,10925920," want to say yeah so a lot of like a school program is based is actually very old and it's too much effort to"
10925920,10932880," change and to switch to a different software to open source software um will require changing"
10932880,10938720," all of the program materials and schools just cannot afford that to do so the easiest and the cheapest way"
10938720,10944560," for them is just to start pirating software it's actually very common in russian schools uh which is kind"
10944560,10954240," of sad but yeah uh my school i think managed to switch to linux and free pascal i think they switched"
10954240,10961200," um but this is because that school had a lot of attention so they won't be able to successfully"
10961200,10971280," part software yeah and my well in school we we don't have a computer science or programming classes we"
10971280,10977280," called informatics classes probably just like in germany or something and my informatics teacher"
10977280,10988320," um absolutely hated free pascal compared to turbo pascal uh yeah so like the level of quality actually"
10988320,10993440," is it's just she says that the id is just like worse than the original to the pascal id"
10993440,11003040," um you had pascal abc oh i think i heard something about it uh but i think she switched to free pascal"
11003680,11008480," we used to have ubuntu on a usb stick and boot from it on the school computers oh interesting"
11008480,11013920," currently for school i'm uh basically forced to use visual studio windows and everything"
11013920,11016960," is azure and cloud it's kind of frustrating at times yeah"
11016960,11023680," uh we drew algorithm diagrams on the black on the blackboard and informatics classes"
11023680,11029040," i don't remember doing that in school i don't remember doing that in university though"
11030160,11036640," in my uni all computers have windows and ubuntu installed nice i'm also grew up in a poor area"
11036640,11043040," so computers at school was a no-go but some of this software can be costly so i can understand yeah"
11043040,11051040," all righty so uh we need to create the texture so that's the problem we need to create the texture"
11052480,11063440," um okay so format um so what's gonna be the format the width and height width is the amount of columns"
11063440,11070480," as far as you can tell it's gonna be calls and height is gonna be rows so the format pixel format"
11070480,11082640," so which one should we use um can i have something like rgba i want to have rgba"
11082640,11092240," five five no yeah i want to have rgba 32 this one it's my favorite chat what is your favorite"
11092240,11101680," favorite pixel format my mine is rgba 32 which one do you use there's a lot of them but yeah"
11101680,11112480," this one is actually using rgba 16. that's a good one nice format i would say uh very nice format um"
11113760,11119600," changes rarely not lockable changes frequently lockable can be used as a render target"
11119600,11122240," render target"
11122240,11126400," i'm web dev so hex codes"
11126400,11135120," pixel format hex codes"
11135120,11140400," that's cursed thank you so much"
11143520,11153120," okay so i think we need to do uh texture access streaming because i'm a streamer so yeah so"
11153120,11156640," and we managed to create a texture would you look at that we managed to create a texture"
11156640,11162400," nice oh noise noise noise noise noise"
11162400,11168960," so uh as they'll destroy texture"
11171600,11176160," so i think that's what we'll have to do here we'll have to destroy the texture"
11176160,11183040," okay so i'm gonna do it sdl destroy"
11183040,11186480," context board"
11186480,11188560," texture"
11197040,11204480," so when we fill the cell we're not gonna do this uh what's that google logo"
11204480,11211600," wait what did it change is that one"
11211600,11219520," ah it's valentine's day valentine's day this is that's what it says for me in russian"
11220240,11225360," valentine's day i don't know if it's the same for you it could it could be regional actually"
11225360,11228240," um"
11228240,11235680," so in here is an interesting thing when you start a rendering right when you start rendering"
11235680,11237680," valentine's day"
11240640,11250960," so we're doing the grid but we also need to lock the screen uh the lock the texture so let's do it like"
11250960,11264080," that sdl texture lock"
11267360,11281040," sdl texture lock maybe lock texture yeah lock texture"
11281040,11287760," so the texture lock axis which creates uh"
11287760,11296240," this is filled in with the pitch of the locked pixels the pitch is the length of the okay that"
11296240,11308720," makes sense i suppose broken streamer broken streamer broken streamer bro i'm sorry"
11308720,11316560," so this one critical error critical"
11316560,11325120," broken streamer broken goddamn streamer mongolian thought singing stream"
11325120,11332320," yeah yeah probably i'm not sure if i do that in a very authentic way um i'm not sure how"
11332320,11339280," properly do that at all to the fact um so also we need to give the pointer to"
11339280,11348800," where it's gonna store all that right so this is a board texture and um i guess yeah we know for sure"
11348800,11354560," that format is going to be 32 bits i might as well actually keep it like this so it's going to be"
11354560,11362080," pixels and board pixels board pitch which is going to be just an integer"
11364320,11377520," in the integer i'm not worried until he starts repeating exterminate exterminate"
11377520,11386800," exterminate okay so here's the pixels and we'll need to take the context"
11387600,11402960," so here's that one text board peach"
11402960,11410560," i'm actually super proud of at how i managed to organize my abstractions which makes it super easy to"
11410560,11418480," introduce this optimization it's cool cool so then we unlock the texture and how do we unlock the texture"
11418480,11427840," we just provide the texture to unlock it cool uh yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep uh context board texture"
11427840,11436240," so this will this is where we end the rendering and um in here when you want to do that essentially"
11437840,11449520," um what we do this is that and then we do the context actually yeah context board pixels we take the board"
11449520,11457200," pixels and we need to access the row row is going to be uh we need to access the specific pixel uh row"
11457200,11466880," multiplied by context uh board pitch board pitch plus the column and this is where we're gonna assign this"
11466880,11473760," center i think so yeah we're just assigning a specific pixel instead of using uh feel wrecked because we"
11473760,11479760," don't feel correct chat tell me do you feel wrecked"
11488720,11510640," my best joke okay so after we're uh we did that after we did that um we need to slap that texture onto the screen"
11511680,11518880," uh so how do you slap it how do you slap the texture slap that texture sdl"
11518880,11528240," copy texture all right we need to copy the texture render i think this is render copy yes slap slap that"
11528240,11539840," texture onto the screen right so it's gonna be scc scc so we have to provide the renderer uh context do i have to"
11539840,11544640," lock it you have to lock it to slap it you have to lock it to slap it i don't think i need to lock it to slap it"
11544640,11553920," do you have lock no it doesn't even like it okay cool context board uh actually just a renderer um"
11555840,11559680," it's it should be available in the core"
11559680,11568960," renderer yeah there we go so then i take the texture uh board texture and then i need to organize the"
11568960,11580480," erect construct correct correct so this one is going to be zero zero but also width and height so width is columns and height is rows"
11581440,11587360," yeah there we go so and that means i should be able to replace this entire stuff with just"
11587360,11598000," rect cool so just render copy rect and that should be okay cool i think i've done it i think i literally"
11598000,11606800," have done it so i replaced scheduling shed ton of rectangles with just drawing or all everything into a"
11606800,11613680," see into a texture and i did that under the abstraction of the framework without the breaking of the"
11613680,11619760," abstraction of the framework this is actually amazing i really like it um so and it should"
11619760,11625280," work automatically for all of the examples including rule 110 which is also goddamn amazing"
11626720,11633040," uh all right so let me see uh i'm gonna try to rebuild everything and see how it will build okay so"
11633040,11640240," context uh passing argument three look a texture from incompatible pointer so it expects what starts"
11640240,11648240," type but the argument of the type is you okay oh come on dude seriously um okay i can just do it like that then"
11651440,11657200," uh probably uh probably bad idea okay so maybe i need to store the board pixels in void and then"
11657200,11663520," reinterpret it later i think that's what i have to do uh then i have to reinterpret it later because"
11663520,11668400," that's that's what it wants here so it's not that big of a deal to reinterpret it later i can always do"
11668400,11676960," something like uh pixels where i can just take the context board board pixels right like this"
11678320,11687360," and just do pixels like that uh yeah yeah sounds sounds pretty good to me oh it's compiled already"
11687360,11694880," it's compiled i wonder if it's gonna be faster now holy it's compiling it's compiling"
11694880,11705760," all right so i want to start with something small oh by the way textures also have linear interpolation by"
11705760,11712560," default so if we reduce the resolution if we reduce the resolution to something small like rose"
11712560,11728880," weird question perhaps do you enjoy yourself while coding your own project well do you see my hands"
11731920,11741440," you know the answer okay uh let's continue um so we need to wait until the ends"
11741440,11759920," i'm just joking of course yes i don't enjoy myself of course yes how would i"
11759920,11776960," all right so yeah essentially let me rebuild the roof one window okay so rule one one oh and"
11776960,11782640," okay and it's sick faulted nice"
11789920,11793920," i see uh i see uh i see i see i see"
11793920,11798960," mm-hmm"
11798960,11806240," so the source should be rows and columns"
11806240,11810720," ah i see what's going on yes"
11814240,11827520," render render render render okay so this is src so src is okay src is okay then we're gonna have a dst dst"
11827520,11838560," rectangle is gonna be from zero to uh screen width and screen height but why did it sec fault i don't i'm not quite sure"
11838560,11846160," like i'm like and think i'm oh no i'm using pitch which is correct so i don't know why but"
11846160,11846720," yeah"
11846720,11848800," uh"
11848800,11855920," so the first time that means you don't watch me that's basically what it means sorry"
11862480,11868480," all right so that kind of worked but not really"
11868480,11873520," so this is pitch and this is column"
11879520,11885520," oh i think i know what's going on uh we need to multiply uh this entire stuff by"
11885520,11888160," well no not really"
11888160,11897840," pitch is in bytes oh i see i see now i see i see so this has to be like eight"
11898640,11905120," uh then this has to be multiplied by four and this has to be multiplied by"
11905120,11914880," well no a row yeah yeah and this has to be multiplied by"
11914880,11926480," four right then it has to be reinterpreted as 32 and then saved like that and that yeah okay that actually"
11926480,11929840," explains why it was so bad uh right"
11929840,11938080," uh-huh i take the pointer to that then pointer to that then dereference that point holy that's"
11938080,11943600," it's a whole new level of and that explains it okay there we go"
11943600,11953040," so that's pretty cool and we render everything into the texture and that's pretty fast look how fast it is"
11954720,11960560," that's pretty cool so all of that is rendered into a texture and the colors are kind of up but maybe"
11960560,11968080," that's okay so and what's funny is that it didn't really make it super"
11968080,11974720," like smooth it didn't try to apply by linear interpolation which is perfect in my opinion"
11975280,11982640," so okay so okay let's try to look at more sophisticated examples um minus b and we're"
11982640,11989520," gonna rebuild everything so this might be the best optimization we can do for our simulation"
11989520,11998160," basically optimize the rendering right render into the texture rather than by rectangles"
11998160,12013760," uh so yeah it takes some time to rebuild everything uh but once we're done it should be super fast"
12013760,12019600," because essentially we are using uh hardware acceleration for all of that"
12022080,12029120," okay so let's take a look at the goal the game of life and game of life goes"
12029120,12036080," okay so what about uh this thing so this is the brian's brain"
12036080,12041600," and it's holy look at how fast it is it could be actually super fast"
12044080,12057360," this is so nice all right so that's super cool now the moment of truth wire world the colors are"
12057360,12062800," fucked up by the way i i am aware of that uh but uh what i'm trying to do i'm just trying to get the"
12062800,12071680," basic rendering done uh okay so that means we need to change the square uh rows it's gonna be eight"
12071680,12079760," uh it's gonna be 600 by 800 okay so that's pretty cool uh i need to rebuild the wire world"
12079760,12092400," yes yes yes yes yes okay why this so and we need a pretty fast uh you know simulation for that machine"
12092800,12099200," if we ever want to see that number being flipped uh i'm not sure if we're ever gonna see that number"
12099200,12108640," of being flipped but if we ever see that that's super cool uh okay and i can speed it up and it's extremely"
12108640,12117840," fucking fast holy shit it's fast uh and it's so smooth i you probably cannot see that but it's extremely"
12117840,12124400," goddamn smooth this is the best optimization you can upload with uh okay i can probably"
12124400,12128320," increase the size of this entire stuff so you can see better"
12128320,12137120," look at that it can actually scale infinitely faster um"
12137120,12144640," infinitely infinitely uh scale infinitely that's what i want to say and it slows down for some reason what"
12144640,12151680," the fuck why is we done all right and you know what it should be also possible to implement like"
12151680,12158000," built-in zoom in feature that will zoom into the particular texture because we're not scheduling a"
12158000,12163040," shot tone of rectangles and whatnot that's actually so cool that's such a cool optimization that we came"
12163040,12169920," up with and yeah we're gonna remove this entire thing it's not needed anymore um so i can even probably"
12169920,12175200," get rid of the core feel but yeah so rendering directly to the texture is absolutely amazing"
12175200,12187840," um let me go to core and allow even faster uh faster simulation so one two three one two three uh so it's"
12187840,12197040," already six uh maybe even like that so let's actually make it even faster uh and does it make it super fast i'm not sure"
12199040,12206480," now port it to walk into maximum performance to be fair theoretically it should be super easy"
12206480,12215280," you know why because i'm using sdl and uh i'm not using anything opengl specific so that means if i just"
12215280,12222800," enable um oh i forgot to recompile yeah thank you if i just enable welcome backend for sdl as far as i know"
12222800,12230960," sdl has a welcome back and this thing will just use vulcan right so yeah i abstracted away from specific"
12230960,12236320," apis so yeah i can easily port that to vulcan and it's probably going to be super fast as well because"
12236320,12243200," i'm using like texture abstraction and i would assume that texture abstraction actually does everything uh"
12243200,12246960," fast fast like it uses the the better the best representation for that specific driver"
12246960,12252320," um yeah i forgot to recompile thank you so much uh so"
12252320,12256800," all righty"
12261280,12266480," so let's actually speed everything up uh it doesn't really go that fast"
12266480,12282880," uh what if i do the following thing where i will set the initial timeout to the uh the minimum one"
12282880,12284240," will it do the trick"
12284240,12289760," because i want to make it super fast"
12289760,12301520," i think there is i i also hit the next limit yeah it's it's relatively fast but not that much"
12301520,12307680," so if i can make it super super small magnitude small"
12309840,12315840," all right if this doesn't work i'm gonna move uh further and implement zooming features so we can"
12315840,12320160," zoom on particular parts of the uh of this thing"
12320160,12327600," it doesn't really become that much faster but is the encoding okay"
12327600,12333360," is the encoding okay with this particular core skin or is it unbearable"
12340000,12344480," it's way better than before probably because of the colors it's it's different colors"
12344480,12350560," still okay so yeah different colors like just encoded differently"
12350560,12355040," i really want to see when the thing flips"
12355040,12360160," but when does it flip does it ever flip at all"
12360160,12363280," which of your compression"
12369200,12373520," it's not the counter made out of gold it's a counter made out of wire world"
12373520,12380640," wire world is a seller automaton from the same family as a game of life"
12380640,12386560," but so game of life has four uh two states of the cell"
12386560,12394400," wire world has four states of the cell so it has a dead cell um conductor"
12395120,12402400," head head head of the electron and the tail of the electron so yeah and it's suited for simulating"
12402400,12406000," um you know uh this kind of circuits"
12406000,12415520," okay there is a fat thing going down here do you guys see that there's a fat thing going down"
12415520,12418640," i wonder if it will trigger the flipping to the next number"
12420080,12424480," so this fat fat thing so let's see if it's gonna trigger anything"
12424480,12432160," i don't know i i never seen it counting up or down i've never seen it do that"
12432160,12438400," so i'm kind of curious uh as well if it's if it's gonna do that at some point"
12442160,12450640," it's probably counter i don't know like okay so now there is another like long thing going up um"
12450640,12455280," when it will trigger"
12459760,12470480," i try my best to optimize it to make it faster to actually see how it will count out so i'm afraid"
12470480,12477840," that maybe i made a mistake somewhere is it starting to do something something i feel like it's starting"
12477840,12483920," to do something there's something changing between oh something changing here so oh it might be actually"
12483920,12489520," flipping soon it might be actually flipping soon so let's wait let's wait if it's if it's a little"
12489520,12494720," flipping soon because something in the states of this digits is changing"
12494720,12497280," um"
12497280,12502800," can't change frame time i already made it as fast as i could"
12502800,12511840," do you even watch the stream come on i optimized the timing i optimized the rendering so the rendering super"
12511840,12521680," fast"
12521680,12528000," so i'm afraid what if i actually did something correctly what if it's"
12528000,12534800," compiled with oh nine is it even a valid flag oh nine"
12538400,12544800," or maybe it waits for some sort of input so we should probably we should have actually read about"
12544800,12552400," this thing maybe it requires some sort of input from somewhere i wonder if we can mess with it by"
12552400,12555360," firing an electron somewhere"
12555360,12562960," so i'm gonna mess with it okay so i messed with it and it's probably gonna destroy it completely"
12564720,12569760," i can mess with it i can click on things here and just yeah just destroy it yes"
12569760,12578800," oh look at that i i messed with it yeah it's completely broken though"
12581040,12587760," that's cool and it's cool that it's actually yeah it shows it nice"
12591200,12598640," you can skip gendering this is exactly what i did do you even watch the stream i enabled optimizations"
12598640,12606960," o3 i skip the generations i skip the rendering for uh for several generations and i also sped up the"
12606960,12612880," rendering now i used efficient texture this is what i've been doing for the past hour does anyone watch my streams"
12614480,12623120," okay cool uh so what i wanted to do um"
12623120,12627600," yeah it's pretty cool it works works"
12627600,12632960," uh so let's try to do this bb"
12632960,12640080," i kind of want to see that on a bigger scale on a way big i want to see it on a way bigger scale so i'm"
12640080,12650320," gonna do um sgb uh i literally just yeah sure um okay so let me try to do that"
12650320,12658160," oh yeah i want you to do the zoom yeah i want you to implement the zoom feature um i want you to implement"
12658160,12675360," uh all right so oh look at that simulation smoothly holy i can even speed it up"
12675360,12682560," yeah that is so smooth and this is because it uses hardware acceleration for for that stuff"
12684320,12685520," yeah yeah boy"
12685520,12692080," quality of the stream went down but yeah"
12692080,12698480," that's so cool"
12698480,12710880," nice i came up with a pretty cool optimization"
12712880,12714160," i'm super proud of myself"
12714160,12724000," all right uh so um yeah i want you to zoom now so what did i implement here"
12724000,12731120," optimize or optimize"
12731120,12739440," rendering for uh square square framework i'm gonna push that right"
12739440,12745600," it's gonna be difficult um so"
12745600,12753360," you can always check it out on your local machine by the way so because the the source is open"
12753360,12760640," um yeah let's let's think about the zoom let's think about the zoom"
12764080,12770400," so for the zoom we can introduce i suppose the position of the camera and the scale and whatnot"
12770400,12774480," um yeah so we can do something like scale"
12774480,12782720," uh originally scale i think should be equal to to one right context"
12789760,12795280," could the zoom could the zoom make it faster probably not uh but since we are rendering into the texture"
12795280,12801920," zoom is actually cheap right so because we're rendering everything into a texture and we just"
12801920,12808320," then slap in the texture with a single draw call um so that means to implement the zoom"
12809120,12815120," we can just transform the texture and that's it it's actually relatively cheap so it's not going to affect much"
12815120,12824320," hopefully we'll see um so the scale is initially going to be uh zero"
12827440,12831120," uh so camera scale let's actually call the camera scale"
12831120,12838960," uh this was render small no it doesn't matter so it's not going to make it faster that way because"
12838960,12842720," it's it's a single i think it's this because it's a single texture it's not going to make it faster"
12842720,12850560," but i'm not having this i'm sure fold camera x uh fold camera y and this thing is going to be"
12851440,12853360," um excellent yeah"
12853360,12865920," so when when i'm ending the rendering so i take the whole src test and now i just need to transform the destination"
12865920,12871520," uh destination rectangle this one is very interesting because"
12874160,12884320," so this is the width and height and uh interestingly enough i think we can simply take the cont multiply the context"
12884320,12889360," uh context camera uh scale"
12889360,12899040," and something like this context camera scale so we might as well do something like float w"
12900480,12908720," so this is the actual width this is the actual height right that we can use"
12908720,12923440," so and we can just make it like this but the position the position is going to be slightly different"
12924560,12929760," um the position is going to be what"
12929760,12937280," oh boy um it has to be at zero zero"
12937280,12944240," so i i probably need to draw that probably need to draw that"
12949440,12961280," yes yes yes yes yes my paint i'm already streaming for five hours god damn it and i also need to then"
12961280,12973120," stitch together the split vote because i fucked up right um all right so here is the screen and so after the scale"
12975440,12985840," i just need to make sure that the center of the scale thing is at the center of the uh of the thing"
12985840,12990480," twiggy io thank you so much for 11 months of tier one subscription"
12990480,13002080," uh thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you um so essentially i need to synchronize their centers"
13002080,13014720," uh all right and it's already zero zero zero zero zero zero starts at here so oh my god"
13014720,13023040," so essentially i need to take the half of the width right so here's the half of the width"
13024400,13034640," multiply by half right and then subtract half of the width of that one right and then plus"
13034640,13040320," the camera uh context camera x"
13040320,13050720," yeah that's it holy okay const float uh x is going to be something like this all right y"
13051920,13057680," it's going to be it's going to be height it's going to be h this is x and this is y"
13057680,13062880," so and in here i can just use x and y and of course"
13062880,13070240," i'll need to floor full of the shits int floor"
13072000,13077840," then i'm going to do it like that maybe self um 10 percent trouble can try"
13077840,13082080," um all right"
13082080,13091920," okay that's just a second so let's rebuild uh specifically maybe"
13091920,13097040," wire world i'm going to start with the wire world because that's the most interesting thing to"
13098000,13105200," uh zoom in so the next thing we'll have to do we'll have to implement some stuff for uh zooming in"
13109680,13116400," so i'll think so the best way would be to do that with a wheel uh but right now we don't really"
13116400,13126480," support the wheel so let me try to do something else so where do we handle things uh time to quit"
13126480,13131200," so here's where we enable the grid i think i mean i need to remove the grids uh grid is kind of useless"
13131200,13133760," at this point uh but it could be useful"
13133760,13140720," yeah it could be useful a little bit better by the way uh grid should be drawn on top"
13140720,13148080," uh on top and where do we we don't we don't even render grid anywhere"
13149840,13158080," i think i i think i factored up uh core keyboards"
13158080,13163840," so how are we going to increase the scale that's a good question"
13163840,13175360," scale plus plus uh i don't know like yeah okay and uh minus is going to be"
13178240,13185280," uh minus but uh we have to be super careful with minus okay so scale could be a similar situation as"
13185280,13187520," with uh speeding up right"
13187520,13198000," uh increasing the scale is just basically multiplying by two right multiplying by two"
13198000,13203040," maybe by half by one and a half and you can make it as big as you want"
13204000,13210720," uh zooming out zooming out is actually dividing by this value and you want to make sure"
13210720,13223200," that this value is not smaller than a particular way like this otherwise it's not making sense"
13230080,13231760," all right so is it going to work"
13231760,13241760," okay wire world image"
13241760,13248320," uh up um"
13248320,13256160," nice so i up big time scale"
13257840,13258800," camera scale"
13258800,13266400," so if it's one should be all right"
13266400,13268880," half of this thing"
13268880,13275760," okay so we take half of the thing and if it's equal to that"
13275760,13281440," all right i don't see any problems but it doesn't work"
13284000,13286080," i don't see any problems but it doesn't work"
13286080,13289520," so if this is one"
13289520,13295440," this should negate itself and end up with the camera"
13295440,13298960," plus and if it's zero there's nothing going to be there"
13298960,13306720," oh boy this is literally painful um i think i need to actually print all of these values and printing"
13306720,13310080," them is a huge pain in the ass uh so it's gonna be x"
13310080,13317840," uh y wh and let's see what's gonna happen show me your values please"
13317840,13324080," wow world oh oh oh"
13324080,13329520," i need to make a small break i need to finish the stream though but i cannot finish it right now"
13329760,13333040," okay"
13333040,13337120," okay"
13337120,13344320," why x and y are this this is incorrect by the way"
13344320,13352080," so width and height half of a width and height is going to be the one value then we subtract half of"
13352080,13363360," this same value camera x and y are not correct at all why is this 500 like this is not correct where did it get that from"
13363360,13369280," i don't understand so what was interesting is that width and"
13375840,13376400," unless"
13376400,13385600," we didn't properly zero it out do i have to zero it out here didn't i properly zero it out maybe i"
13385600,13386160," maybe i didn't"
13386160,13394320," i thought it's actually zero initialized i think it's i thought it's zero initially please don't"
13394320,13397440," tell me that it's not zero initialized that means i make a huge mistake"
13400080,13406240," um no it is zero initialized okay that's kind of interesting"
13406240,13418400," i'm already falling asleep and i don't see a mistake i'm becoming blind to very dumb and simple mistakes"
13418400,13422480," somebody help me oh boy okay"
13425040,13427760," scale is pretty straightforward thing"
13427760,13430640," this yeah"
13430640,13442720," nobody suggests anything new"
13442720,13450880," oh i okay i thought i actually set it to one i put zero there"
13452800,13456080," and i thought i put it one that's why like i never think about it"
13456080,13460000," so the reason why i never checked this one because i was 100 sure that i put one there"
13460000,13461120," otherwise what's the point"
13461120,13464400," okay"
13464400,13469840," okay come on recompile it"
13469840,13480080," takes too much time i should probably disable all three because all three is not helping"
13482800,13484080," okay okay okay okay that was too much actually"
13484080,13492160," uh huh so let's change it to something like maybe one"
13492160,13501760," uh maybe one and i think this one is actually something like equal because it didn't allow me to"
13501760,13512080," properly do that"
13512080,13518400," okay so we can actually finally zoom in"
13521440,13523520," and zoom out too fast"
13523520,13526480," but overall"
13526480,13528000," yeah"
13528000,13529680," huh"
13529680,13533120," but you can zoom in actually quite"
13533120,13538960," quite a lot on each individual pixel and then it just goes to oblivion"
13538960,13541440," um i wonder why"
13543920,13555200," because we have to take a maximum"
13555200,13570400," so and yeah so we can do a pretty thing like that and then you can zoom out you can zoom out quite a lot"
13572240,13574880," and it doesn't affect the performance that much"
13574880,13578640," it doesn't affect the performance that much"
13578640,13587760," we can probably even get rid of the relative uh size because everything like all the rendering is done"
13587760,13593120," within look at that it even has numbers like 41 43 this is something that i couldn't even see before"
13593120,13594800," yeah"
13600000,13604320," we can see even small individual things in there you know pause"
13604320,13606640," and then"
13606640,13612880," mess with uh one of the thing oh i can i cannot yeah it doesn't properly map"
13612880,13618960," it doesn't properly map the clicks so it would be kind of cool to actually go somewhere there"
13618960,13620000," um"
13622640,13626080," uh we're kind of cool to go somewhere there"
13626080,13631680," let me think"
13631680,13642960," so um if context so i'm gonna actually map some of the things that are core keyboard"
13644560,13650720," uh it's gonna be let's actually say i uh it's gonna be context camera"
13650720,13661600," camera uh y and we're gonna subtract what um we can subtract a particular value like 100"
13661600,13667600," maybe not 100 pixels but maybe like 50 and i think it should depend very much on the scale"
13668160,13676640," so the bigger the scale the bigger should be this step right so that means maybe we can multiply this"
13676640,13678560," thing by the scale"
13683760,13686160," uh multiply this thing by the scale"
13686160,13693680," i wish it compiled faster but yeah all three optimizations they take too much time"
13695040,13702640," uh okay so and if i'm gonna do i like it actually goes in the wrong direction okay so it should"
13702640,13709520," be plus in that particular case um and maybe it should be actually like around 10."
13709520,13718880," so once we've done that i'm gonna map the rest of the keys and we can go ahead and navigate"
13719440,13726160," through the through the machine and just look how it works and stuff uh yep yep yep yep seems to be"
13726160,13732800," working seems to be working and uh i can go somewhere here uh just look at what's going on there"
13732800,13737920," uh-huh that's pretty cool all right"
13737920,13740480," um"
13740480,13743280," so"
13745600,13750640," so if it's i this one is going to be key is going to be minus"
13750640,13764560," uh so all right so this one is going to be j and it should modify x but it should actually add"
13764560,13769520," i think j is going to be l"
13772320,13777200," this one is going to be subtracting this entire stuff so let's see"
13777200,13783920," so it will enable us with actually exploring all of that and be kind of cool to"
13783920,13786720," map the clicks and stuff according to the zoom"
13786720,13792080," uh there's all the thing that needs to be done here for making it even more epic than it is right"
13792080,13796320," now but unfortunately like we just don't have too much time to do that"
13796720,13804720," uh okay so we can explore some different things for example the creators of this thing they uh"
13804720,13812480," wrote like different um urls and stuff like that uh we also have this thing"
13812480,13817440," so sometimes it's kind of like zooms out in a really weird way but"
13818720,13823280," yeah so there's these digits uh"
13823280,13827520," it's super cool"
13827520,13831840," this is the yeah it's actually pretty cool uh"
13831840,13840080," what is like a bus error what the is a bus error i really like how they have these small"
13840080,13847840," nodes within the machine itself right so bus error bus error i think it probably lights up when you have"
13847840,13853440," some sort of a bus error uh look at the copyright look at the copyright this is so cool"
13853440,13857600," let's just like think around the corporate this is so awesome holy"
13857600,13866640," this is like advent of code worthy i'm not even joking so essentially you can have a problem"
13866640,13874720," uh where the input is this kind of machine um and you need to simulate it and it will write something for you"
13876560,13882640," this is so god damn cool literally this is advent code uh code worthy thing and what's interesting"
13882640,13890400," is that for advent of code right so the actual answer could be visible only after like several"
13890400,13896480," like million situations or something so you have to make it like super optimized um"
13898720,13903920," or something wait a second wait a second is this an input"
13903920,13914320," wait a goddamn second is this an input i think we found an input so it has zero one two three"
13914320,13917520," maybe this is why it didn't do anything"
13920960,13933280," holy shit okay wait wait to be fair but how do you input there is nothing to input here um yeah"
13933280,13942560," okay let me actually try to do something like this so it's gonna be if uh context core keyboard"
13944480,13948400," all right all right we're gonna reset everything to context camera"
13948400,13962320," context camera zero y zero scale one okay let me see if it's gonna work"
13965040,13971600," um"
13971600,13982000," so now i can reset it back to original thing so that's pretty convenient"
13982000,13991040," so winter we really need to explore it and just see maybe there are some interesting things in there"
13991040,14000560," so this is a boss errors"
14000560,14007040," bitrate is betrayed fucky wacky again"
14007040,14011680," how can i increment it"
14016480,14021440," so this is one two three maybe we could uh"
14021440,14027520," this was probably generated by software and you underestimate some people"
14027520,14038480," i'm telling you this is not as complex as some people do manually in minecraft manually"
14041840,14048320," no i don't think it was generated it could be as well written like uh done by hands or maybe like for"
14048320,14054800," example a repeating patterns could be copy pasted sure uh but yeah so this is not as complex as some"
14054800,14055920," minecraft chat seriously"
14064720,14069920," manually i mean even with schematica you still do that manually you still have to click each individual"
14069920,14071520," block"
14071520,14085920," well there is also like the helpers that help you click faster but i mean still"
14091600,14097360," this is just a counter they're fully working gpus in minecraft true i think something like this"
14097360,14099520," counter in minecraft would be less complex"
14099520,14102960," yeah right yeah that's actually a good point in both"
14102960,14107120," this kind of counter in minecraft is way simpler than this"
14107120,14109360," um"
14109360,14119600," wait a second i think i see i see something interesting what the hell is that down there do you see that"
14121600,14128720," what the f is this it's some sort of clock"
14128720,14132800," you see"
14132800,14136240," why is this there"
14136240,14142400," i can't i cannot even modify it unfortunately because we don't map everything properly"
14142400,14155040," there's a lot of interesting like little things here in there that don't really make much sense but"
14155040,14158000," they're there um so yeah"
14158000,14165440," oh i actually had a like debug output that's why it probably slows down a lot"
14166880,14170240," that explains why it was slowing down from time to time because it was outputting"
14170240,14176240," just for decoration but i mean it's such a small minor decoration that it doesn't really make much sense"
14176240,14181760," all right"
14181760,14189360," actually this particular like simulator that we've built becomes more and more powerful"
14190000,14195760," i think it might as well be able to simulate something even more complex like gases and whatnot"
14195760,14207280," isn't there a blogger who does a breakdown blogger you say that they're doing that over"
14207280,14212240," several posts or something i think it's like one post worthy or something"
14215680,14221440," um"
14221440,14228880," you know powder toy oh yeah powder toy could be also very interesting"
14228880,14236800," all right so let me do a committee committee um"
14239840,14244640," introduce simple camera to square framework"
14244640,14256400," it looks like a fun application of computer shares and what's funny is that i don't really use shaders"
14256400,14268560," so i'm this is done using only sdl not even opengl not direct 3d only sdl guess how i did that only in sdl"
14269840,14284800," and basically i can compile it to work with opengl direct x metal vulcan uh and it will work so it only uses like a pure sdl"
14284800,14302800," i guess in all big sense man yeah you're pretty close i'm rendering into a texture"
14304880,14312640," so the thing about texture in sdl uh sdl texture"
14312640,14321280," uh a structure that contains an efficient driver specific representations of pixel data right so"
14321280,14327920," basically i create a sdl texture and then each frame i render the state of the board into the sdl texture"
14327920,14334480," and then i perform a single draw call of rendering that texture onto the screen since it's a driver"
14334480,14341360," specific representation of the texture with opengl driver it will use opengl textures with vulcan driver"
14341360,14349280," it will use vulcan textures with metal metal and so on and so forth so yeah and it will work efficiently"
14349280,14362240," on any platforms so yeah it's cool uh that's what i'm doing um can we retrace it probably i don't know"
14362240,14370400," anyway so it was kind of cool i wish we could continue because we still have some stuff in here so"
14370400,14377120," but i'm going to declare wire world done we looked into wire world if we can go to look at the rest of them"
14377760,14384880," and also work a little bit on our engine making it more powerful but we're already doing that for"
14384880,14390960," three streams god damn it and we still have a virtual machine to implement i mean"
14390960,14406880," do i continue doing this is this like a month of cell salary a tomato tomato on the stream because i i"
14406880,14413600," want to like try other things as well i mean come on it's kind of it's kind of interesting and it's"
14413600,14418400," kind of cool to work on this engine and make it more and more like featureful and more powerful"
14418400,14425360," just to be able to to be able to power more uh cellular automata uh by the way if you take a look at other"
14425360,14432240," like bb for example right so this one is pretty it's pretty scary but yeah let's actually rebuild all of"
14432240,14433200," the cellular automata"
14433200,14442800," yeah so the camera should also now work in other uh cellular automata"
14442800,14446560," um like for example brian's brain as well"
14448960,14450080," full-time tomato streaming"
14450080,14460240," i don't really like it so far five hour streams by the way five hour stream"
14462080,14470320," um"
14470320,14472800," i wonder if all three actually makes any difference"
14472800,14481200," uh all right so let's let's run bb and i can now zoom in into individual things"
14481200,14486640," right you can you can think of this as like a regular game of life right but then you can zoom out"
14487440,14494880," you can zoom out a lot and there's a the whole universe in here there's a lot of them"
14494880,14499360," but then you can zoom in"
14499360,14502560," and there are"
14502560,14506000," there's a lot of different things"
14511760,14512560," it's pretty cute"
14512560,14522480," all right so you can find the source code of the thing um that we're working on here so you can"
14522480,14530000," check it out on your machine uh yeah and i think it is time for me to go boys and girls i think it's"
14530000,14537200," time for me to go thanks everyone who's watching right now i really appreciate it have a good one"
14537200,14542560," and i see you all uh tomorrow tomorrow i'm not sure if we're going to continue doing this thing or not"
14542560,14547680," uh we'll see because i kind of want to continue doing it but i'm not sure if it's going to be"
14547680,14553520," become too saturated uh check out our what's channel where i'm going to upload the recordings"
14553520,14559200," of the streams we're going to have a separate playlist for uh salary automata uh streams so you'll"
14559200,14564240," be able to watch them from from the beginning uh and check out our discord server for offline"
14564240,14582240," discussion with the community so yeah today was a cool stream uh thanks everyone love you"
14594240,14596240," Thank you."
