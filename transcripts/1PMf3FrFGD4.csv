0,5660," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreation programming session with Amista Zosin."
5660,11180," So today we're taking a look at a very interesting operating system. It's called Essence."
11180,16720," Right, and what I find interesting about this operating system, not only it looks good, right,"
16720,20120," so you can take a look at these screenshots and actually confirm for yourself that it looks"
20120,27000," pretty modern, right, so not like super modern, but you know, it's decent. I would use this kind"
27000,34020," operating system today, but it's also not a POSIX operating system. You would think it's,"
34020,38440," oh, maybe it's some sort of like Linux distro or yet another POSIX. No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
38440,46440," It's not POSIX operating system. It's created from scratch and it's trying to do its own thing."
46440,52620," And that's what caught my attention. This is what caught my attention, right, and like this is the"
52620,59800," reason why I like things, like for example, TempleOS, because like Serenity... No, no, no, SerenityOS"
59800,65720," is not trying to do its own thing. As far as I know, it's basically recreating POSIX, isn't it?"
65720,72000," But it's putting some stuff on top of POSIX, yes, for sure, but it's kind of still recreated. It's a"
72000,79400," Unix-like operating system, right? So, and like, I mean, no disrespect to SerenityOS and Andrew's"
79400,88820," Link and what he's doing, but from my perspective, what he's doing is basically recreating the existing"
88820,94380," mess that we already have. Software is a mess and it's a mess for a reason, right? Because we have"
94380,99560," obstruction layers, compatibility layers and stuff like that. And for me, recreational programming,"
99560,107060," like for me personally, it's a way to escape that mess and try something else. Like imagine,"
107060,113660," what if we had an opportunity to not support something, like, or maybe try a different model"
113660,120340," or whatever, like a different UX? How would it look like? So, and I don't see much point in"
120340,127420," recreating existing software stack mess in a recreational manner. I'm not saying that Andrew's"
127420,132260," Link shouldn't do that, like, and it's actually very fucking impressive. Like what he's doing"
132260,137200," is an insanely impressive, and I actually completely support what he's doing, because on top of just"
137200,142560," doing this very technical, difficult and technical thing, he's also building a community, he's also"
142560,149500," engaging people, right? It's, it's obviously fun. I'm just saying that for me personally, it's kind of less"
149500,156320," interesting than trying out something new, like in case of TempleOS or Essence, right? So absolute love"
156320,161760," what Andrew's Link is doing. And maybe at some point, we're going to actually do a SerenityOS stream. I already did"
161760,169100," SerenityOS stream, by the way, but it was long time ago, right? So and not that many people. So we'll"
169100,173980," already have a lot of new people on the channel. So a lot of people don't remember that SerenityOS stream."
173980,179180," So maybe I'm going to do another one. And on that SerenityOS stream that didn't survive, no, no, no,"
179180,184920," it's not on YouTube. It was actually before I was archiving things on YouTube. Yeah, unfortunately. So and"
184920,192960," on that SerenityOS stream, I actually like developed a game of life, right? So I just like built SerenityOS and"
192960,197860," build an application for that operating system, and just play with it. And it was actually kind of fun. Like I"
197860,207940," really enjoyed it. So yeah, anyway, essence. So you can find the the website and the source code of this"
207940,211620," entire thing here, I'm going to copy paste it in the chat and for people on YouTube is going to be in the"
211620,220740," description. Right. So and yeah, let's go ahead and take a look at this entire thing. It's actually pretty"
220740,228420," simple. I already downloaded the source code and already build it, right? It builds around. So the"
228420,235860," documentation says that it will take around 20 minutes on a modern computer. For me, it took almost"
235860,244340," an hour, but because I'm using an old laptop, like 10 years old laptop, right? So and what's funny is that"
244340,252900," while building, it's actually downloading GCC and first builds a specific version of GCC from scratch"
252900,258420," and then builds the operating system with that specific version of GCC, which kind of reminds me"
258420,264820," what I saw in SerenityOS as well. For some reason, SerenityOS also uses very specific version of the"
264820,272100," compiler and builds with a very specific version of the compiler. So non C++, I think it's a C++. I think"
272100,280340," this entire thing is written in C++, if I'm not mistaken. Right. And maybe it is actually very"
280340,287460," common in operating system development, right? So maybe different compilers have different quirks and"
287460,291700," stuff like that. And maybe it is important for operating system development. I never actually"
291700,297300," developed an operating system. I do plan to do that, right? People keep asking me when I'm going to do"
297300,301940," operating system development. It's coming, right? At some point, I'm going to do that. I just need"
301940,307620," to finish some of my other projects, right? So it was downloading GCC and building this from scratch"
307620,313540," and also building the operating system. So the way you build that, you actually have a start script,"
313540,319940," right? So what you have to do, you have to just call a start script. So let's actually go here, right?"
322980,329060," So TeamUX. So this is a start. I wonder how much time it will take."
329060,336980," So because we're also streaming, right? It didn't take that much time. So it actually"
336980,343540," like shows you a prompt where you can issue different commands. And one of the commands you"
343540,349780," can do is just like build the entire thing or run it with QEMO and stuff like that. Right. And if you take a"
349780,353940," look at this start script, it's actually rather interesting. It consists of a single line."
353940,360500," It consists of a single line. So the first thing it does, it identifies your directory, then makes a bin"
360500,368180," directory and stuff like that. And then it builds something rather peculiar. It builds util script.c,"
368900,379460," right, into build script. Okay. And afterwards it runs the script. And with this product, it builds"
379460,387220," some sort of an interpreter for some sort of language. People say it's like Nob. It's actually way cooler."
387220,393460," Build system is written in its own scripting language and an interpreter of the scripting language"
393460,400580," is part of the source code of the project. It's even cooler than Nob. Right. Because Nob is the library"
400580,404580," and you make an executable, but this is like it's written in a different language, but the interpreter"
404580,410820," also part of the thing. And it's a custom interpreter. Right. So we can take a look at all of these things."
410820,419060," Right. So if you take a look at the script.c, what we can see, we freaking see it like tokenizer."
419060,424900," Look, this is the first thing we see. We see a tokenizer. It's literally, it's literally an"
424900,433140," interpreter. Token tokenizer scope. This is so fucking funny. It's literally an interpreter. And it's like,"
433140,441300," oh my God, it's, it's a legit interpreter. Eight, exactly 8,000 lines of code. Exactly 8,000 lines of code."
441300,447380," Holy shit. I love it. Like, I love this project. It's actually quite rare when a project can make me"
447380,453700," excited. Right. But every time I look at any next project, it's actually so fucking cool. Right. So"
453700,460340," it's a gold mine of different cool things. So, and that's why I say that this developer is extremely"
460340,466020," underappreciated. Like I have no idea why. Right. So these days on the internet, what you have to do,"
466020,472260," you just have to react to a bunch of like other videos or some articles and get popular. But if you"
472260,477540," sit down and do actual cool shit, nobody gives a fuck. It's a fucking tragedy. I'm telling you,"
477540,481860," I'm fucking telling you. So anyway, so this is how the scripting language looks like. All right. So I"
481860,486340," don't really have a highlighting for all of that. Maybe I'm enable it like a C or something like that."
486340,494420," Right. So, and it, yeah, it's actually C like, not really C like, like syntactically, like it doesn't"
494420,501940," have these parentheses and stuff like that. Damn, that's a pretty sexy language. Yo, it's like a better,"
501940,509700," is that a better C or something? What the fuck? And so the build system itself is rather big. So it does a"
509700,514180," lot of different things. Right. So primarily it copies files, download things and so on and so forth. So it's"
514180,518500," actually super cool. Anyway, uh, maybe one day we're going to go into that, but we'll see, we'll see."
518500,525860," All right. So anyway, uh, so if you want to like, I really recommend after the stream, watch the video"
525860,533860," by next, uh, where they presented, uh, the operating system, October 20, 21st, 20, 21st, I suppose."
533860,539620," Right. So it was some time ago. Right. But this demo is actually still relevant. They explain"
540180,547780," the concept of essence OS, like, like how, like what's the, uh, the UX decision behind all of"
547780,550580," that. So it's actually really cool. I really recommend watching this video. We're not going"
550580,557380," to be watching it today. Um, right. So yeah, let's go ahead and actually start it. I wonder if I can do K."
557380,560500," Uh, we would actually do. Yeah. So it starts building and we'll actually start to queue."
560500,567460," Um, the essence of essence OS. Exactly. Exactly. So we'll get some subs. Thank you so much. Um,"
567460,574180," Ormus Buckster for T1 subscription and you talk 39. Thank you so much as well. Thank you. Thank you."
574180,579060," Thank you. Really appreciate it. So it's getting some time. Um, so maybe what we're going to do today,"
579060,583780," we're also going to do the same thing I did in Serenity. Maybe we're going to write an application for the"
583780,590260," separating system. Uh, apparently I looked, um, you know, around the source code and apparently it's"
590260,596100," super easy to add your own, uh, application. So it's rather slow. Uh, when I was not streaming,"
596100,602100," it was a little bit faster, right? So, because some of the resources on my laptop are taken by the streaming."
602100,613380," So, um, is the creator's name even by any chance? I have no idea what's their name, unfortunately."
613380,620500," Um, so yeah, maybe it's written somewhere in some of the profiles, but I didn't really pay attention."
620500,626180," Right. So usually, usually, uh, when I like look up stuff by people on the internet,"
626180,628580," I rarely care about their specific names. Right."
628580,638340," Got himself ordered Raylib to be launched. But why? Like, people, you don't fucking understand. Like,"
638340,646740," yet another fetishization of APIs and libraries and shit like that. I'm not using Raylib for the"
646740,654340," sake of Raylib. I use Raylib because it solves a very specific problem on, uh, the modern operating"
654340,660340," system that we have. Right. It's a very convenient boilerplate of the code that I would have written"
660340,669060," myself. Right. So what's interesting is that some platforms simply don't have that problem that is"
669060,674580," addressed by Raylib. Namely, for example, TempleOS doesn't have that, that problem. Because of that,"
674580,680820," running Raylib on TempleOS doesn't make any fucking sense. You can just use TempleOS API."
682020,687140," You can, you can just use TempleOS API. The same thing with the essence. Right. So it, I'm pretty sure"
687140,693460," it has a pretty good graphical API from what I saw. So, like, you don't need Raylib in here. Like, stop"
693460,700020," fetishization of languages and libraries. Like, I'm not using things for the sake of using them. Like,"
700020,705700," I don't understand this culture. I will never understand this culture. Uh, like, it's something alien to me."
705700,711620," Uh, right. I use things because they solve specific technical problems. And I also recommend you to do that."
712020,717780," Right. Otherwise, you're not really a software developer in my eyes, at least. So anyways,"
717780,725700," uh, so this is, um, EssenceOS. Right. So, and what's interesting is that from that video, uh, right,"
725700,735300," that I show you there, Next actually said that you don't really start applications. You first open windows,"
735300,740980," and then within the window, you decide what kind of applications you want to run in there. So,"
740980,745700," and what's interesting is that this is the window manager, right? So this is basically the window"
745700,753860," manager and the window manager allows you to create tabs, right? So here I have two tabs and, uh, none of"
753860,759540," the applications are currently running in these two tabs. Can I actually separate them? I can separate them."
759540,767780," So these tabs actually act similarly to how, uh, Chrome. Yeah. So again, guys, this was written from"
767780,777380," fucking scratch. Again, like when I'm saying that Next is, uh, underappreciated, I mean it. I don't say"
777380,783460," things like that, like for no reason. And it has like a beautiful design and stuff like that. I'm just"
783460,790580," saying, uh, can it actually like do, Oh, for fuck's sake, it can even do tiling. Fucking. Oh my God."
790580,796180," You can even tile this like in, in windows, right? So you, you basically snap them. Uh, what if I do"
796180,801700," that on a, uh, it's actually full screen. That's, it's fine. Uh, that's so fucking cool. All right. So"
801700,808980," anyway, so you can actually do these kinds of things. Um, so let's actually do full screen. My mouse has died"
808980,816340," again for some reason. So I really apologize for that. Uh, uh, so, and what we can have in here,"
816340,820900," we can have a file manager, right? So, and you can have files. So there's some settings and stuff like"
820900,827540," that. Nothing particularly special. Uh, right. So there's also 2048, uh, which we can also play. Let's"
827540,833540," actually play it a little bit. So you can already do gaming on this operating system, right? So you can play"
833540,840820," games and shit. Uh, how about that games and shit? Uh, all right. So, uh, that's pretty cool."
840820,849780," So what else can you have? Um, so image editor post-ex launcher, even though it is not an, uh,"
849780,855060," like a post-ex operating system, it has a compatibility with post-ex as far as I know. Yeah. It doesn't work"
855060,859780," for me. Right. So you have to recompile it with a specific flag. I wonder if I can actually show you"
859780,864100," if I do something like this. Yeah. So essentially this application depends on the post-ex subsystem"
864100,868420," to enable it to use the post-ex subsystem, blah, blah, blah. Uh, that will probably require to"
868420,872980," recompile the entire thing. It actually takes some time. So I probably not going to do it right now."
872980,878020," Uh, right. So what kind of other applications we have? Like we have a text editor, by the way."
878020,884260," Um, right. And as far as I know, let's actually make the font a little bit bigger, not really that big."
884820,889540," And it has a little bit of a highlighting for different, not really for different,"
889540,896020," for now it has a highlighting for C and C++ and any. Right. So you can actually like write some code"
896020,903300," in here if you want to within that operating system. I don't know if you can compile things in here."
903300,909060," Uh, right. So, but you can definitely save some stuff. Right. So it, it actually saved it in here,"
909060,913780," but I can't really, uh, I can actually open this stuff and yeah. So here is the text file. So you"
913780,921300," can create the text file and whatnot. Uh, so that's pretty cool. Um, right. But I didn't see how can you"
921300,927300," like compile this entire thing, unfortunately, how can you compile this entire thing? So maybe what"
927300,932980," you have to do, you have to use like a post-ex launcher and whatnot. Um, right. So, and it's like"
932980,939060," not finished, obviously this entire thing is not really finished. Right. Uh, and next, unfortunately,"
939060,943140," it doesn't really work on that operating system anymore. The last changes were like nine months"
943140,948020," ago. So as far as I know, they're kind of busy with their work, with their life and stuff like that."
948020,952740," So this is sort of like a side project, but it's a very cool side project. Like it has a very huge"
952740,959620," potential. Uh, right. So, and you know, what would be cool? It would be cool to kind of maybe, as I"
959620,966420," already said, write some sort of like, um, uh, application for it. No terminal. I think terminal"
966420,972580," is available in the POSIX subsystem. Right. So again, the operating system is not a POSIX one. The"
972580,979220," terminal is a very much POSIX-y thing. Right. So because of that, I think it's in the POSIX launcher."
979220,984020," We can try to maybe enable it and see how much time it takes to actually rebuild it. Oh,"
984020,990180," let's go ahead and do that. Why not? So I think the longest thing in the entire process was, um,"
990180,998900," building GCC. So since I already have built GCC, maybe rebuilding the whole operating system with a"
998900,1003700," different configuration is not going to take that much time. So let's actually do config. Uh, and, uh,"
1003700,1012740," what can we do in there? Holy. It has like a GUI, like a TK thingy. Is that coming from,"
1012740,1019220," is that coming from his scripting language or something like that? Damn. This is so fucking"
1019220,1026820," cool. This is so unconventional. This is like, can I search for some things? Uh, right. So there's a flag"
1026820,1032740," enable POSIX. Okay. So I can say, yes, I can save this entire thing and I can close the configuration and I"
1032740,1040900," can do K. Oh, and it will probably, oh, it is building, it's building BZBox. Holy fucking shit."
1040900,1044740," It's going to be using BZBox to create. Oh my fucking goodness."
1044740,1053300," All right. I don't really know how much time it will take. So, um, yeah. So while it's doing its thing,"
1053300,1059700," maybe we're going to do a little bit of a, you know, Q and A session or something like that already better"
1059700,1066020," than XOS. I don't know. Probably the cool thing about this entire build system is that it downloads"
1066020,1072420," the third party dependencies and builds them. Right. So this is what it was doing when I first run it."
1072420,1078100," It is already lagging. I don't really see any luggage. Uh, right. Is it, is it really lagging? Maybe. So,"
1078980,1084580," I don't really know. So, uh, yeah. So when I first run it, this is what it was doing with GCC."
1084580,1091540," Um, right. It downloaded specific version of GCC. It's built it. And now it's doing that for,"
1091540,1096980," so it does not download all of the, uh, dependencies, right. Some of the dependencies I had to, it's,"
1096980,1104100," it's already actually building, like compiling the operating system. So it built, uh, BZBox. So I think it's"
1104100,1121860," gonna actually start soon. Uh, why it takes so much? Because it's a serious big project, obviously. Uh,"
1121860,1130980," that's why. Oh, BZBox. So BZBox is a BZBox. Wait, wait, so you can use BZBox as a library?"
1131780,1137220," That's actually very interesting. I thought BZBox is, um, executable, right? It's a single"
1137220,1143460," executable that acts like different core utilities, depending on, uh, what kind of sim link you create"
1143460,1151860," for that thing. Um, isn't installing POSIX cheating? Uh, cheating is a violation of rules. What are the rules?"
1152980,1156180," Um, I don't get it. What are the rules?"
1156180,1172740," Did you try RAD debugger? Uh, but I think it's only for Windows. No, I never tried it precisely because"
1172740,1179300," it's only for Windows. Uh, if it's finally, you know, gets released on Linux, I definitely will try it. But I"
1179300,1185140," don't know. Is it, is it paid or is it not? Is it free? Uh, right. So I, I'm pretty sure if it's paid,"
1185140,1189220," I won't be able to pay for it. Right. So because none of the paying options are available for me."
1189220,1196900," Um, so yeah. Okay. So it was not that hard. It was not that long, fortunately, fortunately, fortunately."
1197780,1204900," Uh, uh, uh, uh, so let's take a look. So if we try to, uh, this is not what I wanted to run."
1204900,1213460," Just a second. So POSIX launcher. There we go. Oh, it's the prompt is kind of funny. The prompt is kind of funny."
1213460,1222180," Okay. So we can, uh, can I do some stuff? Okay. So we can do application and yeah, so it's kind of, can I edit it in here?"
1222660,1228020," Right. So it's understandable. Again, the operating system is not really finished. Uh, that's very"
1228020,1239460," interesting. I press control C and it showed this popup. Damn. That is sexy. Right. So again, POSIX is kind"
1239460,1245700," of an alien concept for essence. That's why it's probably a little bit inconvenient, but I suppose"
1245700,1250580," NAX didn't really work on it that much. Right. So you can, you can do some POSIX stuff if you need to."
1250580,1256500," Right. So POSIX is like wine for, for Linux in here. Right. So it's only for like backward"
1256500,1265860," compatibility and stuff. Uh, so especially if you have some grid, I wonder if you can do CC. Uh, how are you for"
1265860,1276420," real, bro? Did you, did you fucking see that? That is funny. Out of memory. It couldn't run CC because it"
1276420,1283220," ran out of memory. I mean the, uh, the virtual machine probably doesn't have enough memory or something like"
1283220,1291380," that. Uh, this is so freaking cool. Can I do GCC? Yeah. Out of memory. How can I increase the memory? Like,"
1291380,1297780," is there any way for me to actually see how much memory I even have in here? Uh, so if I take a look"
1297780,1305860," at the system monitor, uh, so we have a memory tab in here, uh, fixed heap allocation, fixed heap graphical"
1305860,1316420," allocation, um, leak one. There are buttons to leak some memory. Is that for testing purposes? Is that for"
1316420,1323060," testing purposes? This is actually funny? Uh, so the, we have some maximum, okay. So let me actually"
1323060,1327860," maybe increase the size a little bit for everyone because it's kind of interesting what do we have in"
1327860,1337860," here. Um, graphic surface heap normal size, uh, fixed heap total size, uh, maximum object cache size. Maybe"
1337860,1344020," this is how much memory we have in here. Um, it doesn't really tell us commit limit. I suppose this is a"
1344020,1350100," one gig of memory, right? So we have one gig of memory. So GCC needs more than one gig of memory"
1350100,1354340," to operate or something like that. Is that what's going on? Maybe it was just trying to pre-allocate"
1354340,1360420," like a huge, uh, chunk of memory, like some sort of like a region into which it's going to be allocating"
1360420,1368420," things and couldn't because it's just like doesn't fit into the memory of this thing. So I don't really know"
1368420,1374500," what's going on. So, uh, let me see, maybe is there a TCC maybe? No, there is no such thing."
1374500,1383940," If I do take a look at which CC, so which out of memory, huh? Oh, it says out of memory on any of"
1383940,1393780," these things. That is very interesting. So LS is fine. But if I try to do something, okay, why does it set out of memory?"
1393780,1402500," So, uh, maybe the PostEx launcher app has a limited memory assigned to it? Uh, right. Maybe, maybe it does."
1402500,1409380," Like, I don't really know how to maybe give it more memory. Uh, the right click doesn't work."
1409380,1416100," So we can take a look at how much, so I have two, um, hypotheses is that maybe,"
1417780,1426180," so it starts a separate SH process and separate SH process just doesn't fit in there. And LS minus L is"
1426180,1435060," probably built some sort of built in into this thing, right? So we can try to maybe increase the"
1435060,1441860," amount of memory used by the emulator, but we need to find, maybe there is some sort of option that allows"
1441860,1446500," us to increase the amount of memory. So let's actually go ahead and see if we can do that. So I'm going to"
1446500,1451860," shut down this and I think maybe check ULimit2. Uh, I'm pretty sure I won't be able to actually run"
1451860,1458500," it in here. Um, okay. So maybe it's somewhere in the configuration, right? Open local config editor."
1458500,1466180," Uh, maybe there are some other things. So we have building debug, uh, search and replace utilities"
1466180,1471220," designer to open. Oh, you can have an interface designer in here. This is actually super cool."
1471220,1476580," So I'm going to make an assumption that maybe it's somewhere in the config. Let's start the config"
1476580,1487140," and see, uh, what kind of stuff memory in megabytes. Okay. Uh, so that's what it is. What if I actually"
1487140,1495220," give you two megabytes, right? Um, yeah, let's actually give you two megabytes and see, maybe that will"
1495220,1503620," increase it, uh, price. There's also primary drive, right? So this is some sort of a primary drive"
1503620,1511300," and I suppose this is not a memory. So memory MB is probably like a RAM. Um, yeah. Okay. So we'll just save it."
1511300,1518580," And let's try to run it one more time. Is there any way to just run it without rebuilding it? Uh, it looks"
1518580,1524580," like it just always run it. Uh, so because it feels like it's always build it. Yeah. It feels like it's"
1524580,1532020," always build. Just in case, um, more RAM than a hard drive. Yeah, exactly. I hope it's not going to kill"
1532020,1542340," my entire stream by the way. I really hope so. Uh, it may, it actually may. All right. Um, isn't it"
1542340,1550180," megabytes? So would be two giga? Yeah. So I give it two gigabytes. Why not? Um, so why not give it"
1550180,1556180," two megabytes? I think we can afford two gigabytes of RAM in 2024. Why not?"
1559700,1567300," Have you ever tried to extend CLang? Yes, I did. I did that with TCC specifically. I added, uh, basically"
1567300,1573620," downloading of the headers when you include them. So one of the things I did, uh, I did that if you"
1573620,1579620," include with HTTPS, it will actually download that header and include it. So this is one of the things"
1579620,1585860," I did long time ago. There's even a video about that, but I forgot where it's, where is the link for"
1585860,1593620," that video? So I really apologize for that. Uh, please check the script console, uh, the script"
1593620,1600420," console. Okay. So I will check it out. Um, I saw a PSEX folder in application. Maybe it has apps in there."
1600420,1606340," Yeah. Well, I mean the applications that I was running 200, 2048 and file manager, they are"
1606340,1610180," the, this application, they are located in the application folder."
1611380,1619060," Yeah. Lip curl stream. It's a loop curl stream. Um, I thought you were actually avoiding it. No,"
1619060,1623780," it's because I know this is the applications, right? So that you run for in the, in essence."
1623780,1633620," Based next stream. Exactly. So I think we're ready. Uh, fuck. Shit. Fuck. Damn."
1635940,1643140," All right. So, uh, let's go into the metrics. What do we have? So people ask me to check the script console."
1643140,1654340," Uh, what the fuck is this shit? Couldn't find inside its scope. Can I?"
1657140,1659700," How do I use that? What is the script console?"
1659700,1671940," You broke it. I don't know how to use it. So int x10. Okay."
1671940,1681940," Uh, no, none of this work. This is actually really bad. I think at least the help command should work."
1682500,1688500," At least the help command should, when you are designing like a prompt, uh, application, right?"
1688500,1693140," When you design a prompt application, you have to make sure that some sort of a help command works"
1693140,1699940," and prints you something like h, uh, help. None of that work. Because again, I tried different thing."
1699940,1704980," Uh, it's impossible to get some help that will explain you how to use this thing. So it's like,"
1704980,1710100," unfortunately, this is a bad design. Uh, I'll like subtract points from that. I'll definitely subtract"
1710100,1717060," point for that. Anyways. So if I try to do this kind of stuff, so what if I do CC still out of memory,"
1717060,1723700," still out of memory. So, uh, yeah, maybe it just reports a thing incorrectly. What I'm thinking is"
1723700,1730980," that maybe the command is missing. I think the command is missing. I think it is using a wrong"
1730980,1736420," error, no code to describe it. Yeah. So I think it's a wrong message. So that's what's going on in here."
1736420,1742340," It's not really out of memory is that it's using, uh, you know, a wrong error message that happened"
1742340,1749220," to me way too often. Honestly, when I was developing and see that happened to me way too often anyway."
1749220,1753380," So let's actually try to write some stuff for the separating system. I don't know. Uh, I think that"
1753380,1759060," would be interesting. So all of the applications, right? So all of the applications, they are located"
1759060,1767140," in the apps folder and here are their source code. So as you can see, 2048, uh, is basically two files"
1767140,1774340," CPP and any file, I suppose any file contains metadata. Yeah, it is metadata. So name, uh, use a single"
1774340,1780100," instance. So you can have several instances. I have no idea what is an instance. Then you specify the path"
1780100,1785940," to the source code and you have embed. So you can actually have some resources and stuff like that. So how"
1785940,1791460," an application for an essence operating system looks like. This file is a part of the essence"
1791460,1796180," operating system. This is licensed under a term of MAT license. C license written by next. Okay. That's"
1796180,1802900," cool. So you include essence.h. I suppose it's kind of similar to windows.h, right? Uh, shared string. So it"
1802900,1812020," has like its own standard library and stuff like that. Tile course. Damn. Right. Damn. And people tell me,"
1812020,1818660," brah, you need to run Raylib in this thing. Look, this thing has its own shed that doesn't require Raylib or"
1818660,1826820," anything like that. So where is the main? Does it have a main, uh, oh, it has a start. Okay. So this is"
1826820,1832980," probably, I'm going to just assume that this is probably the entry point for, uh, for the application. So you"
1832980,1843860," have to initialize it. You have ES buffers. Uh, so then you can, damn. So settings file, you read an"
1843860,1852100," entirety of the settings file into the buffer, into the bytes of the buffer. And then you're probably"
1852100,1858340," parsing it or something like that. And the settings file, is it defined somewhere? Where is it defined? Okay."
1858340,1865540," Okay. This is the path schema. Oh yeah. It's, it's inside its own operating system. It probably has"
1865540,1871780," its own path schema, right? So you, you have some, something called bar and I suppose like this is a"
1871780,1877940," settings and within the settings you have like a default dot that. And this is kind of interesting,"
1877940,1885300," actually do like all of the applications have their own sort of like a file system, like a virtual file"
1885300,1890740," system, because like this is hard coded, right? So when I say settings, it's probably settings for that"
1890740,1894980," specific application or something like that. That's probably what it is. It's kind of, it's kind of"
1894980,1902740," interesting. I really like that. Um, so then you, you have specific functions for the buffers that reads"
1903300,1911540," chunk of the, of the buffer. You read high score, you read the score, uh, then you read the buffer into"
1911540,1919380," some grid and stuff like that. Then you free it. And then you have a loop. Oh my God, it's event-based."
1919380,1923700," I mean, I mean, what did they expect? Like all of the Google applications have been best, I suppose."
1923700,1931060," Right. So you have an infinite loop and you receive messages, you receive messages and you process those"
1931060,1938020," messages and then, yeah, it's, it's kind of windows. Uh, right. So it's kind of, it's kind of like a"
1938020,1944820," windows. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So you set an icon. Yeah. There you go. Uh, you create a panel"
1944820,1950340," and yeah, so this is a manual GUI, right? And it's not an immediate UI, right? So it's not the immediate"
1950340,1957540," UI. As you can see, we are creating the tree. We are creating the tree. So it's retained. So we first"
1957540,1962020," create the tree of this thing and then we give it to event loop. Well, I mean, we are organizing the"
1962020,1967940," event loop effectively. Uh, right. So, but we then let the system to send that messages and process them."
1967940,1972340," And what kind of messages you have, you also have an application exit, uh, save configuration,"
1972340,1976020," right? So you can save the configuration. This is pretty straightforward. Like I can just read that."
1976020,1980260," I don't even need documentation or anything like that. It's like, yeah, it's, it's very much"
1980260,1988180," straightforward. Uh, that's so fucking cool. Uh, anyways, so do you have, uh, like some sort of a"
1988180,1995380," example? So there's samples. Um, so game loop. Hello. Okay. So let's actually take, and hello is written"
1995380,2003220," in C. Look at that. So you can actually write in C++ and C, which makes sense, right? Why not? So, uh, here,"
2003220,2010660," um, you have a hello and stuff like that. So hello. Okay. Let's see. Um, we're not using the C standard"
2010660,2015540," libraries, so we need to initialize global constructors manually. Oh, so that's why we do that."
2015540,2022420," Global. Aha. Okay. So that's, that's very interesting. Okay. Okay. So you have an infinite loop."
2022420,2028340," And what's funny is that you don't really have an exit condition. Well, in reality, you kind of do."
2028340,2035140," So weren't we receiving the exit message somewhere? Uh, I think we were receiving the exit message."
2035140,2041380," Let me actually take a look super quick. So in, in here, when we were processing application messages,"
2041380,2047940," one of the messages was, um, application exit, but the only thing we did is just save configuration"
2047940,2053380," and nothing else. So where's the safe configuration? Yeah. So we just save configuration. I suppose,"
2054980,2062180," um, the applications are killed forcefully. I think that's what it is, right? It usually in,"
2062180,2068420," in POSIX, right? In UNIX, it's the application that says, okay, I'm going to exit. And that's why they"
2068420,2077060," calling the exit Cisco. So here, I suppose it's the user who closes the application and the message is"
2077060,2084900," sent as just a notification is just a notification, bro. You're about to get killed. Do all of your"
2084900,2090660," stuff, save all of your configs and get the out of here. So you don't even have to do anything,"
2090660,2095860," right? So it will kill you automatically. It will just unload you anyway. It just basically tells you"
2095860,2102260," the user requested to kill you. I'm sorry. Here's some time. Do some stuff, right? So this is actually"
2102260,2108420," pretty cool. I really appreciate that. Uh, well, I mean, application can probably try to exit. Maybe"
2108420,2116420," there is some sort of like an exit call. I'm pretty sure. Hmm. In this model, how the system knows when"
2116420,2123460," to do the kill? When the user pressed the, the X on the window, when the user pressed the X, this is how"
2123460,2128420," operating system knows, okay, this application has to go. This application has to go."
2128420,2136420," So, Yusu, Yusu, Yusu. Alrighty."
2136420,2145060," So how does it actually know when it's ready to be killed? That's a very interesting question. Maybe"
2145060,2151220," receive message. This is my hypothesis, by the way, I don't really know how essence work. But if I were to"
2151220,2157380," make this system, how would I do that? I probably would make message receive kind of block a little bit,"
2157380,2165380," or I would use it as a essentially an indicator that the application waits for the next message,"
2165380,2171940," and that's when it is time for me to kill the application. Probably. So essentially, when I received"
2171940,2180020," message exit, when I sent to the application message exit, I would wait for its next message receive,"
2180500,2187140," and upon receiving its message receive request, only then I would kill them, which has a very"
2187140,2193460," interesting implication. What if I never call message receive after receiving message application exit?"
2193460,2200900," I don't know. Like, what would you do in that case?"
2202820,2207460," Maybe after some timeout? Who freaking knows? Like, I don't really know."
2207460,2215620," But to be fair, like, what would you even do? So what if you exit out of stuff? There's so many"
2215620,2218420," questions, like, and we don't even know how to develop for this yet. So,"
2219140,2229380," right, so let me let me see. So this is a hello, right? So this is a hello. And yeah, so here we receive"
2229380,2234180," the message, then we do create, we don't even handle message exit, right? So because again,"
2234180,2242660," we have nothing to save or like to do after we are done with this endeavor. So the system wants us to"
2242660,2249940," create an instance of our application. Call instance create with a message and application name. Instance"
2249940,2257140," of our application. I remember hearing that word before. In the configuration, at least in the"
2257140,2263220," configuration of this thing, it was saying use a single instance. So that means there are applications"
2263220,2268980," with several instances, and instance is something that you create yourself manually, apparently. I"
2268980,2275780," wonder if it is basically a window. Maybe the application that can have, maybe there are applications"
2275780,2282340," that can have several windows over several tabs or something like that. I can see that. Why not call"
2282340,2288420," it window then? Because maybe it's not really a window, right? It could be also a tab. I don't know,"
2288420,2293140," we'll see, we'll see. I think we're going to discover that at some point. So create a text"
2293140,2300100," display with the hello world message, right? So you do text create. Okay, so an instance has a window,"
2300100,2305620," right? So window is a part of the instance. Because of that, instance is not necessarily a window."
2305620,2315220," I wonder if instance is sort of like a process. What if the multiprocessing in this operating system is"
2315220,2319860," just like several instances? Like, I don't know. I'm just speaking out of my ass. I'm just, you know,"
2319860,2325380," confabulating shit like a crazy chat GPT model. That's what I'm doing. So add the text display to the"
2325380,2331860," instance. The text display should fill the window, right? So you specify that. Use the window background"
2331860,2344180," style. Okay, so pass minus one as a zero terminated string. Ah, okay. So this is a pointer to the string,"
2344180,2349540," and this is the size of the string. But if you have a string that is null terminated, you pass minus one,"
2349540,2354980," and it just assumes that the string is null terminated. It supports both guides. An operating"
2354980,2361220," system that supports both styles of strings. I think WinAPI also does support like both styles of strings"
2361220,2367220," for some like WinAPI calls. Right, but I don't quite remember. I'm not a Windows developer. Honestly,"
2367220,2372500," I would take this kind of operating system over Windows anytime. I want to install it like on actual"
2372500,2379540," hardware on some old laptop or something like that. If I can develop from this operating system without the"
2379540,2384980," host operating system, I wouldn't mind using it for recreation programming. Imagine having a simplistic"
2384980,2391780," operating system like that somewhere in the woods in a cabin and only have a compiler and do recreation"
2391780,2398420," programming for yourself. Something like an OpenBSD Carmack style. I think Carmack actually did this"
2398420,2404980," session where he went to like completely isolated himself with the OpenBSD source code and just like"
2404980,2412980," did OpenBSD development or something like that. I think it was Carmack, right? So I think it was him."
2412980,2418100," Right, so and yeah, so I'd like to do something like that with the essence. That would be kind of cool."
2418100,2423620," Right, right, right, right, right. Okay, so all that looks pretty straightforward, but the question is"
2423620,2429860," how do I even fucking create this thing? Because I didn't think I have... I didn't see hello application"
2429860,2436500," in there. I wonder if I can do something like this. Right, so I'm going to do hello. But the thing about"
2436500,2442820," this application is that it says that source is in the sample, so maybe I will have to change it"
2442820,2448580," like that. And the question is, will it pick it up? Will it actually pick it up? So let's actually see."
2448580,2452100," Let's actually see."
2452100,2458660," So what we need is an OS that you can recompile while running."
2458660,2466900," I think it is possible in TapOS. I think you can basically recompile parts of the operating system"
2466900,2474420," while it is running. So technically, nothing really stops you except your own skill to recompile the"
2474420,2480260," entirety of TempleOS while you're running it, right? So if you can't do that, that is obviously skill issue,"
2480260,2485540," right? So you probably don't know how to do that. Where's the progress bar? You don't need the progress"
2485540,2490980," bar, you have a spinning thingy. Who needs a progress bar if you have a spinning thingy?"
2490980,2504260," You can do this with PreBSD too? Yeah, probably. I don't know. I don't really know anything about PreBSD."
2506260,2514420," Progress bar is bloat, mate. It's a bloat. Why it stops spinning in a zoom? Because the zoom utility"
2514420,2519940," doesn't really update in real time. What it does, it makes a screenshot and zooms in on a screenshot."
2519940,2527300," I actually kind of prefer it like that because I sometimes use it to stop some specific animation"
2527300,2532820," and look at specific pixels and stuff like that. So it's not really zooming in, it's actually taking a"
2532820,2541700," picture and zooming in on the picture. That's what it is. That's what it is."
2541700,2551300," So that's a pretty interesting development loop. You know what I'm talking about, right? So the usual"
2551300,2556740," development loop is modify the source code, then recompile and then test the changes, right? So here"
2557860,2561860," we're going to have a great time, honestly. So that means we will have to keep that in mind"
2561860,2567940," that we don't really have a super short development loop, unless we figure out how to compile things"
2567940,2572740," on the operating system. But as far as I know, it's not really supported yet, right? So it isn't..."
2572740,2576660," Here is hello. That's not bad. Look at that."
2576660,2583380," That is easier than I expected. Like, what the fuck? So yeah, hello world."
2587060,2595540," Okay. So this is cool. That is fucking cool. All right. So I think like you guys know what we need"
2595540,2605460," to do. You guys know what we need to do, right? We must create game of life on this thing to assert"
2605460,2612580," our dominance. That's how I assert the dominance in the project. I come in and implement game of life."
2612580,2619140," That's what we need to do. We need to implement the game of life. But I'm already saving for almost"
2619140,2624420," one hour, right? And I ran out of tea. So I think the time has come to make a small break"
2624420,2629300," and make a cup of tea. And after I have a cup of tea, I'm going to be ready to rock and roll and"
2629300,2637700," implement the game of life. All right. So let's create game of life application. So let's go into"
2637700,2643460," apps. And I wonder if there is already maybe game of life. I didn't think so. So if we take a look at the"
2643460,2649220," samples, there's game loop. I mean, this is something that we're interested in rather than hello world,"
2649220,2657300," honestly. Right. So there's a game loop. And if we take a look inside of the game loop. So this is the"
2657300,2665940," thing. We are creating the instance, right? We're just creating the instance. And what else do we do in"
2665940,2674980," here? Oh, this one is interesting. We create a canvas, first of all. Okay, so I think I did actually"
2674980,2680420," very good thing that they decided to check this specific example. You custom create element windows,"
2680420,2686660," fill, you fill the whole thing. It's focusable, panel, and so on and so forth. So you created some"
2686660,2692820," sort of a canvas. And if you take a look at the, what is the canvas? Yeah. Okay. So it's a canvas is"
2692820,2702020," just the ES element. All right. So ES, I suppose, stands for ECMAScript. So we have a message user and"
2702820,2712900," canvas message. Okay. So you can actually assign callbacks to different messages that this element"
2712900,2718420," receives. Okay. That's very interesting. So you can send messages to specific elements and you can"
2718420,2725540," actually receive them through callbacks. All right. So you can have some other stuff in here. All right."
2725540,2733860," That's very cool. Then you start animating. All right. So send animation messages to the canvas."
2733860,2741460," Start animating. Focus the canvas to receive the keyboard messages. That is very interesting."
2741460,2749540," And then you... So you actually do this thing once. Because I suppose you do that when you receive the"
2750180,2755540," instance create message and you receive it once at the beginning of the application. So I assume, because"
2755540,2762660," it makes sense. So afterwards, I suppose you just keep looping and receiving messages and you don't"
2762660,2768580," really handle them. Right. So that's basically how it works. That's basically how it works. That's actually"
2768580,2777620," kind of cool. Okay. So and within the canvas message, within the canvas message, if we receive message paint,"
2778340,2787460," you get the boundaries of your entire thing. And you render the game within that thing. So and..."
2787460,2790420," Yes, paint!"
2790420,2807700," Oh my God. And I swear to God, I think I saw a similar API idea in SerenityOS as well. So yeah, in Qt there is a..."
2807700,2814180," It tries to mimic this classical UI libraries, right? So it's actually quite common paradigm in this"
2814180,2821940," retain UI things. It is actually very common paradigm. So okay, so there is a paint and you can draw blocks."
2821940,2828100," Then you draw rectangle and stuff like that. Okay, so that makes sense. That makes sense. Okay."
2828100,2832580," So then you receive an animate. Keep sending animation messages."
2833700,2840180," Oh, okay. So you also have to say that the animation is not complete. So it keeps receiving messages."
2840180,2846420," This is some sort of like an inner knowledge that you have to have about this animation system. But okay,"
2846420,2852180," so I think we'll gain that knowledge over time. So we'll update the game using the time delta provided."
2852180,2858660," And then we repaint the whole thing. This is like a very old-school style UI programming."
2858660,2864900," Like a very old-school style. Not really all I mean. Whatever I'm doing, people would say that it's"
2864900,2871060," probably old-school. But it's kind of like a renaissance, right? It's more of like a renaissance"
2871060,2876580," programming. So before that, we were doing that. And before that, we were doing whatever I do today, right?"
2876580,2884180," So something like that. Something like that. It's sort of an alternative way. I would say it's a GUI"
2884180,2891860," programming from 2000s and 2010s. Let's put it this way. Or maybe a little bit from 90s, right? A"
2891860,2899140," little bit from 90s. It's the GUI programming for that era, roughly. Yeah, okay. So this is basically the"
2899140,2904180," game loop. Within the game loop, you have different things in here. You're drawing blocks and stuff like"
2904180,2909300," that. Looks cool. Looks GUCI. Looks at Tamaguchi. It would be kind of cool to actually find the definitions"
2909300,2914020," for all of these functions somewhere, just to have a list of them, right? Because that's how I like to"
2914020,2923780," learn about APIs, right? So let's actually go ahead and do that. So I want to go and just grep for this"
2923780,2928740," entire stuff, right? So where... I suppose this is a structure. So let's actually just go ahead and assume"
2929220,2935620," that there is a structure like that, like aselement pane. And I wonder where it's going to be. So it"
2935620,2941140," would be maybe better to exclude certain folders, right? So there's a problem with grep. Maybe I can"
2941140,2947060," use just a rib grep. I don't remember. Do I have a rib grep? RG? I don't even have a rib grep."
2947060,2953540," All right, so rib grep. Maybe we can install that. I hope we don't have to install it from cargo,"
2953540,2958340," because cargo usually builds things from scratch. Okay, so there is a rib grep in here. So let me actually"
2958340,2976260," quickly do that. My mouse keeps dying at a very inconvenient moment. And only when I'm streaming,"
2976260,2981220," by the way. When I'm not streaming, my mouse does not die. So something with streaming. I think it's"
2981220,2983380," hackers that are trying to hack my stream."
2983380,2995540," Okay, so I have a rib grep. So I should be able to maybe do some stuff like this RG."
2995540,3000980," And it should... No, I didn't find it. So that means it's probably defined slightly differently. It's"
3000980,3008660," probably defined like this. Okay. So is it not? It's... Oh, it's a function. Why did I think it's a"
3008660,3019540," structure? I'm gonna do it. Okay. Let me see. I want to find maybe ESPainter. That's what I want to find."
3019540,3024900," I think ESPainter is a little bit more interesting. So it's going to be RG. And I'm going to find it as a"
3024900,3031460," struct. I wonder if it... Okay, it is in fact defined like that. Does it... Like a rib grab has a mode where"
3031460,3037780," it prints name and then the lines so my Emacs can actually parse the shit because it's not convenient."
3037780,3043140," This is one of the reasons why I usually don't use a rib grab because it uses this awful format that is"
3043140,3048420," not parsable by default. So minus N I suppose. Let me find minus N and what does it do?"
3048420,3057460," Where is the minus N? Okay. So line... Show line numbers. Okay. So let's do it. Let's do that. N..."
3057460,3062180," Freaking g-baited!"
3062180,3070340," Okay. Sorry. Why am I listening to it? Like it's almost like I never"
3070340,3076100," fucking learn anything. It's insane how I never learn anything. So there's something like POSIX."
3076100,3088100," Okay. Fuck that. Whatever. So let's actually go to maybe Util. So there is a designer. Designer 2."
3088100,3095300," And it's 47. So... And this is USPainter. Right. So the US..."
3096900,3103300," USPainter. Like honestly, like I would just use a rib grab more if it was just printing in a normal"
3103300,3110180," format. Like the usual format. It's just like... I don't know. Skill issue I suppose. Um..."
3110180,3116420," All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. So that's cool. I like how everything is so"
3116420,3124340," readable. I really like that. It's also pretty stupid. Even though this is a C++ by the way. Chat. Chat. This is C++."
3125620,3132260," And it's like a C style C++ actually. So they don't even use methods. Right. It's just structure."
3132260,3138180," Um... I don't like that. ""Reable C++ impossible"". Yeah, it is possible apparently."
3138180,3148100," They're using Luigi! Oh my god! They even... This is the same GUI library that they use in a GF."
3148660,3154660," you know, the debugger GF2. It's the same GUI library. It looks different, but because it's maybe"
3154660,3161140," it has a different look and feel. But the core is the same actually. Right. The core is the same."
3161140,3170020," That's actually super cool. Anyways. So... Game loop. Game loop. Let's go ahead. So you know what? I want to"
3170020,3179140," get rid of that hello thingy. Let me quickly do that. Uh-huh. So... All right. Let's go into here and let's"
3179140,3189940," create a goal. A goal... Excuse me. A goal in you. It's a conveys game of life. Conveys game of life."
3190660,3199940," So what do we put in the innie? Right. So we're going to have samples. Game loop. Innie. So we have to put"
3199940,3212900," general. Name is going to be game of life. Game of life. And to build this entire thing we have to do apps. Apps, apps, apps, apps."
3214740,3225540," Goals. Sorry. All right. That's cool. So we've got that. What's funny is that goal CPP. What if we just"
3225540,3231620," create an empty thing? Right. So we have an empty thing. Like how is it going to react to just an empty"
3231620,3240340," build if I try to do it like that? That's a very interesting question, Chad. Cheers."
3243620,3250420," It actually has a port of GF. You mean for the essence? I didn't really read the chat, so I'm sorry."
3250420,3260500," So let's do a compilation. We have to imagine that we're programming in the very old times,"
3260500,3266580," like for the mainframes and stuff like that. In the time... At the times of punch cards and mainframes,"
3266580,3272340," you're supposed to write your application on a piece of paper. You have to hand it to a special person who would"
3272340,3280260," create punch cards or punch tapes for you and then load it into the mainframe, do the batch processing,"
3280260,3287620," do the computation and return you back a compilation error. So we have to sort of role play like that."
3287620,3295220," Like imagine we are programmers at that time. Right. And every time you have a long compilation cycle,"
3295220,3300740," think about it like, oh, I'm just like a, you know, old-fashioned programmer for a mainframe. Right."
3300740,3307140," So yes, yes, old programmers. Guys, see, it is bloated. Yes, it is bloated."
3307140,3309700," You have to program in the Fortran for IBM mainframe."
3309700,3315780," Seven hours passed, you have a typo. Exactly."
3318180,3324740," Imagine debugging session at that time. There was no debugging session actually. Right. So you get"
3324740,3329940," back a compilation error or result and you have to analyze whatever the you wrote on that piece of"
3329940,3336500," paper. And as far as you know, the program you would write like with handwriting. So if the person who is"
3336500,3341300," typing, like creating punch cards for you, misinterprets some characters,"
3342820,3346980," so you're screwed. Right. So maybe your program is correct actually, but the person"
3346980,3352180," that was typing the punch card fucked up. And like, you don't know whether it's you"
3352180,3356500," fucked up or the person who was actually typing this thing fucked up. Like nobody fucking knows."
3356500,3360260," And the question is like, do we have, we have a game of life. Can I run it?"
3360260,3364260," Apparently I can't. It actually crashed."
3364260,3371700," Right. So there is game of life. It compiled successfully. That's what's funny. It compiled successfully."
3371700,3379620," And it just crashed. And this is an empty file, by the way. It is absolutely empty file. It doesn't"
3379620,3386660," contain anything. It didn't fail compilation. So it created an executable. That executable doesn't work."
3386660,3394980," Interesting. Interesting. So that's for sure. So that's totally fine. Let's do the shutdown."
3397620,3404100," Alrighty. So I wonder if there's a way to just compile only the application. Like,"
3404100,3409140," is there any way to do that? So maybe I can take a look at the help. So you're going to find the search"
3409140,3417540," of the project. Oh, that's very interesting. So yes, paint. Unrecognized command find."
3420340,3428980," Oh, okay. It has a built-in grip. The build system of essenceOS has a built-in grip, guys."
3428980,3435780," So just for information, you can use no heading with the ripgrap to do the stuff you want."
3435780,3440420," That's a very long flag. Is there a shorter version on this line? Like, I don't really like it."
3441060,3446100," Okay, so we have build the application in ports."
3446100,3451380," So can I do help build?"
3451380,3459380," I want to build only applications. That would be kind of cool."
3459380,3463780," Create a live USB or CD-ROM. This is actually super cool."
3466420,3472420," So apparently, like, I don't really see a way to just, like, build the apps."
3472420,3476660," Um, what if I say build goal"
3476660,3481220," and recognize command? Okay, so there's literally no way to do that."
3481220,3486500," You literally have to rebuild everything, apparently. You literally have to rebuild everything. Okay."
3488260,3495460," Uh, so as far as I know, uh, right, so we can take a look at the samples game or game loop and stuff like that."
3495460,3500180," So let's do void star, right? So this is a void star. This is one of the things we have to do."
3500180,3507860," And we have to initialize all of the constructors and stuff like that. So while true, we are receiving a message."
3507860,3514420," Yes, message, message. Eh, what the fuck is going on Emacs? Yes, message, receive."
3515140,3522740," Yes, message, receive. So, and all of that is not going to be, um, you know, available unless we include the essence, right?"
3522740,3532260," So that's where it's all coming from. The first thing you have to do on receiving the, this thing, on receiving the message,"
3532260,3539140," you have to create, you must, you obligated create, obligated to create an instance, right?"
3539140,3543140," So that's what we're doing in here. We're creating an instance. And what's interesting is that they"
3543140,3550100," making the instance like a global thing, right? So yeah, I suppose even though it's a global variable,"
3550100,3557460," it's still a local variable within your application, right? So globalness of a variable is kind of relative."
3557460,3562900," It's global for your code, but it's not visible outside of your application. Is it really global if"
3562900,3570420," it's not visible outside of your application? I don't fucking think so. File is more global than your"
3570420,3578020," globalest of the variables. Think about that. Think about that. Database is the most global of the"
3578020,3585300," variables in your application because it's visible in other applications. Like think about your pure"
3585300,3595300," functional programming language. How the fuck is it pure functional programming if it's mutating this huge"
3595300,3605780," ass variable called PostgreSQL? That is what I call the definition of hypocrisy. Like using Haskell and then"
3605780,3612100," storing all your estate in PostgreSQL is the most hypocrite thing you can ever do in your entire life."
3612100,3618900," I'm fucking telling you, mate. Fucking telling you. It's just a monot. Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. You can circumvent"
3618900,3626740," the hypocrisy through a monot. But anyway, I see you through. I know the truth. I programmed in Haskell."
3626740,3634100," I know how it works. You won't trick me, okay? You won't trick me with your fancy monots. Anyways,"
3637700,3644740," let's continue. So we created an instance. It's called game loop, but let's actually do game of life."
3644740,3652260," Right. So this is a game of life. And do we need to handle anything? Let's actually leave it as it is."
3652260,3656340," Let's actually leave it as this and see how it's going to perform. I think it's going to be interesting."
3657620,3662820," Right. So just create an instance and just continue polling the messages. That's it."
3664580,3669780," All right. So let's go ahead and just build. So probably have to do key."
3669780,3680020," Oh, it's already open. Wait, wait a freaking second. What the fuck is going on, chat?"
3680020,3682660," Why did it start so fucking quickly?"
3682660,3688500," What the hell is... What the fuck is going on? I didn't expect that. Even my mouse has died."
3689140,3697300," So it was so unexpected. Okay. So game of life. And okay, so that works, right? That created a window,"
3697300,3706740," right? Which is completely black. So there's nothing running there. Wait, installing without..."
3706740,3716100," Was it already running or something? That's kind of bizarre. Anyway, so maybe it does have some sort of"
3716100,3721860," incremental building, right? If I try to do that. Okay. So it actually compiles faster."
3721860,3728260," I suppose... Okay. I was thinking that maybe it doesn't have an incremental build and it always"
3728260,3734020," rebuilds everything, but apparently it's not true. So, okay. So that's actually super cool. I really like"
3734020,3738340," that. So that means we can iterate a little bit faster, which is important, I think, which is"
3738340,3743380," important for the game development essentially. All right. So let's go into the game loop."
3744820,3749540," And the first thing we have to do, we have to essentially create a canvas, right? So we have a"
3749540,3758100," canvas. So here it is. I'm going to put this element in here, right? And yes, create element,"
3758100,3763460," custom create element. So I probably can do some stuff like this. Can I find this thing?"
3763460,3771780," That's actually super cool. I want to find the definition. So it's in the GUI CPP, right? So it's a desktop"
3772340,3785620," GUI CPP line 3604. This is how you create a custom element, right? You supply the parent, right? So the"
3785620,3793380," parent, the flags and the ES style ID. So that's how it works. So we allocate some stuff on the heap and"
3793380,3799540," stuff like that. You initialize and then you just return. Okay. So that's pretty cool. So this is the desktop"
3799540,3807140," layer of the operating system. This is just a desktop layer. Okay. So let's go ahead and create the canvas."
3807140,3815860," So we're going to be using ES cell fill. So it will fill the entire cell. Then it's focusable"
3815860,3821940," and style panel window divider, whatever the fuck it is. Okay. So that's fine. And we're just basically saving"
3821940,3830980," that in here. So another thing we have to supply the user message, right? So this is the user message and"
3830980,3836660," we need to start the animation. So send animation messages to the canvas"
3836660,3845540," and focus the entire canvas. So this is what we want to do in here. It's kind of interesting that you do it"
3845540,3849860," once, right? So what if it unfocuses?"
3849860,3857060," Oh, okay. So you start in it and you're making sure that it brings itself to the front. That's probably"
3857060,3863140," what it means. I think that's what it means. That's why you focus one. You create a window."
3863140,3867220," It might be created somewhere behind, but you want to sort of like a focus right in your face. It may get"
3867220,3871460," unfocused, but that's the decision of the user, right? So we're trying to be annoying like that."
3871460,3878740," Okay. Makes sense. So, and if I try to compile that, it should not compile by the way, right? Because"
3878740,3885460," the function is not like a canvas message is not available. All right. So this build system is"
3885460,3890900," actually kind of cool, right? So it has its own prompt, right? So you modify some things and you"
3890900,3896180," rebuild it. Sometimes you want to find something, right? So you want to find ES Painter. You can find"
3896180,3900580," it in here so you can grab it. It's kind of an interesting idea actually, like build system as a"
3900580,3906580," sort of like a shell as sort of a prompt. I've never seen that before. Maybe it is a thing in some"
3906580,3913060," projects, but this is, I think this is the first time I see something like that. Right. Yeah, it's kind of cool."
3913060,3921700," I really like things that are kind of unusual. I try new different things. So what was the, what was the"
3922500,3932820," canvas message? Okay. Canvas message. So this is a canvas message. It returns an integer, interestingly. And"
3932820,3941620," in which case it returns an integer? I suppose maybe at the end, it always returns zero, as you can see in"
3941620,3952100," here. Right. So it returns zero, which is understandable. So bound, yes, bounds in set."
3952100,3966660," Interesting. So here we're supposed to draw the state of our game. In here, we're supposed to update the state of our game."
3967300,3972900," And in here, we're supposed to handle the input from the user, which also updates the state of the game."
3972900,3979300," Makes a lot of sense, actually. Makes a lot of sense. And what's funny is that it doesn't use switch cases."
3980580,3984900," It doesn't really use switch cases. And the reason why it doesn't use switch cases is probably because"
3984900,3990740," there's too many messages, right? And switch cases usually, like, it's usually better to use them when"
3990740,3994660," you handle all the cases. And in case of the messages, you obviously don't handle all of them,"
3994660,3998580," all of the cases. So that's probably why they just use if-else to maybe"
3998580,4005940," do not trigger the warning about not handling all of the messages, or maybe to explicitly say that we're not"
4005940,4010580," handling all the messages. I don't fucking know. So Vera Stanchov, thank you so much for tier two"
4010580,4015700," subscription. Again, absolutely not necessary, but I really appreciate the gesture with a message hype."
4015700,4020100," Hype indeed. It's actually a pretty interesting project in here. Okay. So the first thing we do,"
4020100,4026180," we take the bounds of the painter, right? So, and this is just a rectangle. This is just a rectangle. And I"
4026180,4036580," wonder if we can try to find that specific rectangle. Okay. So it's in OS header. It's in OS header."
4036580,4043700," So it's not even C code. Right. So I suppose it's something like basically generated or something like"
4043700,4053220," that. Yeah, it probably is generated. So let's actually find desktop OS header. This file is a part of"
4053220,4061060," essence written by next. It's something generated, I swear. Yeah, it's not even prefixed with dashes or"
4061060,4070340," anything like that. It could be... Oh, it's even... Damn, there's so much like a code generation in here."
4070340,4077220," It's interesting, honestly. It is interesting. Okay. So some of the definitions for the structures are"
4077220,4083220," basically defined in some other places. So let's actually go to the desktop OS header and let's"
4083220,4089780," find the struct ESPainter. Right. So, and it's actually ESVectangle. That's what I want to find. Yeah."
4089780,4098260," So, okay. It's actually... It's not defined at the left top point and the size. It's defined as the left,"
4098260,4106740," right top and bottom. Right. Okay. So, and okay. This one is inclusive, but this one is exclusive."
4106740,4114020," Do you guys know why? So basically, exclusive means that it doesn't include like the last thing."
4114020,4121540," Yeah. So it doesn't include the pixel that it's on, essentially. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly, chat. Exactly. So you"
4121540,4128820," can do things like R minus L and get the actual width. Right. So that's why you can do that. So"
4128820,4135460," it actually makes sense. It's actually convenient to keep rectangles like that. This is actually super"
4135460,4143380," convenient. Anyways. So let's go to the game loop. And then here we do the game rendering. So do we do"
4143380,4154980," anything special? No, we actually don't. So we can maybe do ESDrawRectangle. We supply the painter in here."
4154980,4161460," We supply the painter. We're translating some rectangles and stuff like that. But I'm not sure if I"
4161460,4169220," if I care. So sprite bounce or some other bounce. I want to command this thing out and I want to just"
4169220,4177620," render whatever rectangle. Right. So can I do ESRectangle and supply left, right, and top and bottom in there?"
4177620,4189540," ESRectangle. So yeah. Left, right, top and bottom. So left is going to be zero. Right is going to be 100."
4189540,4195300," Top is going to be zero. Bottom is going to be 100. Something like this. Can I do something like that?"
4195300,4203540," That will be kind of interesting. Might as well just do something like ESRectangle. Rect."
4203540,4210580," Maybe even something like that. Yeah. So provide the rectangle. So now we have to provide the color."
4210580,4216980," I'm not sure if you can see that. You can't probably see that here. So we provide the two colors. I don't"
4216980,4221940," really know why we provide two colors. And then we provide something ESRect1. I want to find the"
4222580,4230020," definition of this thing super quick. So where is it defined? It is defined again in OS header,"
4230020,4238820," surprisingly. Okay. So OS header. Yes. Oh, I'm doing the wrong thing completely. So I copy-pasted"
4238820,4244100," completely wrong thing. DrawRectangle. I want to find it. Yeah. It's a drawRectangle. I need it."
4244660,4255140," Um, okay. So that means it is here. DrawRectangle. So, okay. That makes sense. So the first color is"
4255140,4263780," main color. And the second one is a border color. And then you have a border size. All right. So I"
4263780,4269860," suppose I don't really care about the second color here. I don't think I care about it. And they actually"
4269860,4276900," provide the size via the ESRect1, which is rather an interesting macro. So what does this macro do?"
4276900,4283060," Uh, so let's actually find this entire thing. So, oh, the, the macro just, okay."
4283060,4288900," This is very interesting. So you have a special macro where you provide one number and it just construct"
4288900,4294740," the rectangle out of like this thing. It just repeats that value for each individual component of the"
4294740,4299940," rectangle for left, right, top and bottom. Right. So, which is convenient, I suppose. Right. So you"
4299940,4305860," just basically say that it's going to be rectangle two, two, two. Uh, right. Two, two, two. Okay. So that,"
4305860,4311300," that makes sense, I suppose. That makes sense. So in here, that means I want to have a red rectangle."
4311300,4318340," I don't really care about the color of the border. And in fact, I don't really care about the border"
4318340,4324180," whatsoever. So that means I'm going to do something like this. So I fully understand how this function works."
4324740,4329460," hopefully. Right. So this is just the paint. We don't, we're not going to really handle anything"
4329460,4334980," else yet. Right. So we're only going to handle, uh, us, uh, MSG paint and stuff like that. All right."
4334980,4338580," So let's actually try to build and run this thing and see how it's going to perform."
4338580,4347060," And now it's taking some time because I, did I update or OS header or something? Okay. It's kind of"
4347060,4351700," difficult to know when it decides to rebuild everything and when it doesn't decide to rebuild"
4351700,4358500," everything. So yeah, it's kind of bizarre. So that was again, everyone, how are you guys doing? Um,"
4358500,4366180," yeah, I wish I just had a little bit better laptop, maybe on a better modern laptop. I wouldn't have to"
4366180,4372740," wait as much, but I mean, it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't. Honestly, like recently I saw"
4372740,4380580," John Blow complain on Twitter that like whatever laptop he buys this day, it doesn't survive after a"
4380580,4386740," couple of years or something. They, they basically all die. So they're, they're all basically like a trash."
4386740,4392100," Is it even possible to buy a decent laptop in 2024? Maybe I should not even bother."
4392100,4400580," Maybe I should not even bother. How did you find this OSs? Uh, I have a, my secret supplier of OSs."
4403540,4413540," Uh, maybe external GPU is better for cooling. Uh, maybe the framework laptop seems cool. I'm not sure if"
4413540,4421220," they sell it in Russia. Uh, so probably not. Uh, maybe you can buy it through some suppliers, but whatever."
4422180,4427940," Um, they're hella expensive, but to be honest, the new MacBook has lasted me a while. Okay."
4427940,4433700," I just use desktop. Eh, I want something like more mobile, honestly, than a desktop."
4433700,4440020," Desktop is just too huge. Thinkpad. Yeah, Thinkpads sounds great, actually. Maybe I should stick with Thinkpads."
4440980,4448020," But if I'm more than Thinkpads are also kind of a, kind of a..."
4448020,4455380," Okay, so we're done. Get ready, chat. Oh, fuck."
4458100,4468900," All right. I waited two minutes just to get... Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. So, it's actually..."
4468900,4480180," All right, so that's, that's much better. Um..."
4483460,4492820," At least it doesn't rebuild everything. Uh, so let me see canvas message. Uh-huh. No, canvas message."
4492820,4499300," Ooh, this one is weird. Like, originally this thing accepts element. Am I..."
4499300,4506180," Yeah, I'm being... I'm being an idiot, I think. I think I'm being an idiot. Like, where do you even"
4506180,4513140," get the paint? You get the paint from a mess. Oh my god. So, it's inside of the message. And you don't"
4513140,4521300," even use the element in here. I thought you accept an element like as... Oh my god. Oh my f***ing god."
4521300,4532100," Oh my god. F*** me, mate. Compile game of life. Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool. Booting operating system,"
4532100,4552820," okay game of life you can you can develop software for the separating system it's that easy i didn't"
4552820,4559940," even use any documentation by the way like i'm just looking around the source code and i'm just"
4559940,4565380," copy pasting stuff from different parts and i can like make a simple application that does things"
4565380,4571220," right um so yeah you don't even need any documentation so that's that's super cool"
4571220,4579060," this is actually super super super cool okay so i can put some stuff on the screen"
4579060,4584820," so that means i can already make a game out of that so let's actually see how you can"
4585940,4590820," um handle controls and stuff right so if i take a look at the game loop"
4590820,4598580," uh right so one of the things we have is message type so the messages that we really care about"
4598580,4605860," are message key down or message key up all right so i think i'm going to take a look at yes message"
4605860,4611380," key down right so this is going to be the first thing that i'm handling and the second thing i'm"
4611380,4619460," handling is going to be a key up um right and to be fair i want to have a some sort of a vector do you"
4619460,4628980," have uh some sort of a vector in here so there's a vector file um might as well might as well just"
4628980,4636740," have something like float x um maybe even dx no we we just need x which is going to be the position"
4636740,4642180," of this entire thing right so this is going to be the position maybe it's called vec uh right so is it"
4642180,4648980," called back no no already so there's no like math vectors and stuff like that that's kind of a shame"
4648980,4655380," that's kind of a shame we can always create maybe our own thing like a vector two uh right so it's"
4655380,4666260," going to be float x and y and uh yeah so we're going to have position right position is um we can"
4666260,4673460," initialize all of that stuff maybe down below right maybe down below we can initialize all of that stuff"
4673460,4679620," when we receive uh instance create but not decided we can actually initialize all this stuff somewhere"
4679620,4686740," here so position uh is going to be zero zero and velocity is going to be also zero zero right so this"
4686740,4695140," is where we initialize all of this thing and when we are rendering all of that stuff right so x is this one"
4696260,4704660," so that means this is position x uh and this is position x plus 100 so we can actually maybe factor"
4704660,4710260," out since this is c plus plus for compile time constants we don't have to use per processor we can"
4710260,4718020," just say uh something like a rect uh rect sizing right it's gonna be 100 right so this is maybe just 100"
4718020,4723620," and here we can just do rect sizing uh rectum size oh funny joke"
4725380,4729540," uh all right so then we have this kind of thing so this is going to be position y"
4729540,4732820," and this is going to be position y plus erect size"
4732820,4739860," so i know that all of that is floats right but i'm using floats for computations so we don't lose"
4739860,4748980," any of the computations um okay so but maybe i can just can initialize all that stuff right so they say"
4748980,4755140," that they run all of the destructors in this init thing right so that means maybe"
4755140,4759700," we don't have to do it like that right so all of the initialization probably going to happen in the"
4759700,4769700," init i hope so um okay so we're just rendering this entire stuff and um so we're going to be probably"
4769700,4775940," doing updates right so we're going to be updating the position on the update message of some sort and"
4775940,4784900," update message is actually message animate uh right so it's somewhere here and message animate um right we have to"
4784900,4791140," say that it's not complete so it's never finishes the animation this is a little bit a little bit of a"
4791140,4798900," bizarre thing but it's fine it's actually kind of fine so and then we ask the the entire thing to repaint"
4798900,4804740," itself please go repaint itself we're using like literally using c++ we're using no ptr and stuff like"
4804740,4814420," damn i like using c++ and programming in c style i love it because you get stronger typing"
4814420,4821460," right you get stronger typing you get to use this new ptr and stuff like it's so cool too bad like"
4821460,4827780," there's some c++ fans that stop shoving all of the crazy c++ features everywhere when it's just like i"
4827780,4833860," i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know uh so what do we have in here so we're going to be"
4833860,4840420," doing update and i wonder if i can just do something like so delta ms right i can probably do the following"
4840420,4847700," thing i can take delta ms i can multiply it by velocity and then add the position like that and since"
4847700,4858260," this is c++ i can overload the mother flipping operators can your c do that can your sloppy c do"
4858260,4870020," that i don't think so i can overload the people just you i'm sorry um so yeah let's actually overload some"
4870020,4876580," operators uh so i'm going to be operator multiplication and we're going to accept the vector and so here we're"
4876580,4883220," doing the scaling right so i take the velocity and where do i put yeah i'll put it on the right so"
4883220,4891220," that means i want to actually do vector 2 um it's called v and this one is a scalar right so that's what"
4891220,4901220," we're doing here and uh so we just return uh v x multiplied by s v y multiplied s and i suppose the"
4901220,4906500," other thing we have to do we have to do operator operator plus equals so here"
4906500,4913140," we accept uh it's gonna be actually kind of funny so i don't remember i think plus x is supposed to return"
4913140,4920260," the reference so here we accept the reference and then we accept the other thing so let's call it d"
4920260,4927140," right so and in here we're just going to do v x plus x dx and like this and then we have to return"
4927140,4935140," d i think this is how you implement plus equals if i'm not mistaken uh right in c++ so you accept the reference"
4935140,4940740," and this entire expression must also return the reference usually traditionally right traditionally"
4940740,4950020," that's how it works um okay so and that's about it so when you do key down when you do key down we need"
4950020,4962900," to check what kind of key you press actually what kind of key you press uh we do scan code uh-huh"
4962900,4972980," that's very interesting so keyboard scan code left arrow scan code left arrow all right"
4974580,4983540," um and also uh so one of the things we can do in here is maybe a kind of a similar thing so there is a"
4983540,4990900," boolean is left held uh we can also do something like that is left held which is going to be true"
4992100,4999620," all right so this is going to be true uh otherwise if we encounter sort of like a right"
4999620,5012980," right we do is right held and we can kind of copy paste these things in here uh and just replace them"
5012980,5020660," with falses something like that and because of that actually we probably don't even need the velocity"
5020660,5031380," because we can construct velocity uh on each frame so here we have false and this one is basically right"
5033300,5041540," so essentially uh we create vector to velocity right so this is going to be velocity which is zero zero or"
5041540,5053700," whatnot and then if is left held right we do velocity plus um you know vector and we have to go to the left"
5053700,5064180," so minus 100 zero right and then if is right held uh we do this thing um"
5064180,5070660," plus just a regular thing so that's how we're going to be doing that and then we"
5070660,5078500," multiply it by delta ms and so on and so forth and then we um yeah so then we just do the rest of the"
5078500,5083860," stuff that's basically it i think i think that's basically it we could actually simplify this entire"
5083860,5089860," thing i like to introduce the notion over the enumeration for a direction then i have array that"
5089860,5097780," maps the direction to maybe scan code or maybe to the element of the boolean array that answers whether"
5097780,5104260," it's held or not so it's a little bit easier to work with and stuff like that um right but let's actually"
5104260,5107700," see if this entire thing compiles because i'm pretty sure it doesn't compile so i want to go"
5107700,5111780," through all the compilation errors right so let's actually go through all the compilation errors and"
5111780,5117940," see uh okay so there's a bunch of okay so there were a bunch of warnings but apart from that it just"
5117940,5126020," compiled apart from that it just compiled okay so uh that's pretty cool just a second i need to refresh my"
5126020,5135620," my mouse because it died again so game of life uh all right so i press oh it disappeared but it"
5135620,5141620," disappeared when i pressed left and right so which is kind of a good indicator that we're doing something"
5141620,5152020," correctly in here uh right so i wonder what so it's a millis delta milliseconds okay let me actually find"
5152020,5155540," this goddamn delta milliseconds what's the difference it's a fuck okay"
5155540,5166500," well i mean i can't understand why right so because it's a low level it's on the level of"
5166500,5173300," like integers and stuff like that we need to convert it to float so essentially if it's a milliseconds um"
5176100,5178500," so we have to take this entire thing"
5178500,5186260," uh and multiply it by by this right so that's what we have to do"
5186260,5193700," that may work so there's a little bit of a warning about like narrowing when we're doing this kind of"
5193700,5199940," thing so maybe we could explicitly in c++ you're supposed to statically cast things right so static cast"
5200500,5205860," and it's going to be like an integer or something like that uh right so that's how"
5205860,5215700," was not particularly convenient all right uh okay so let's try to run it one more time"
5222420,5231140," okay"
5231140,5242900," i'm holding left i'm holding right it's lagging a little bit surprisingly but it's working and i wonder why is"
5242900,5250980," it lagging maybe because i'm streaming maybe because i'm streaming but that's fine so we can handle things"
5250980,5257060," all right so that's kind of cool that's actually kind of cool we're trying to make a game of life"
5257060,5265540," maybe uh so uh let's go ahead and you know do the grid i suppose let's go ahead and do the grid"
5265540,5276260," that's 2048 lags that's a good question actually but i mean i'm not really doing anything that the"
5276260,5283460," example doesn't do uh right i don't really expect it to lag that much i don't really expect it to lag"
5283460,5288260," that much uh that'd be fair like we're already swimming for two hours i'm not sure if i'll have"
5288260,5294500," time to do game of life because it's it's a little bit involved uh right so maybe i'm not gonna do that"
5294500,5301460," it is lagging actually right because again it's kind of like my my laptop is is really weak i'm pretty"
5301460,5307220," sure on your computer it's gonna be way better uh right so i'll give it the benefit of the doubt i"
5307220,5316180," don't think the operating system is that but laggish right uh it's it's in emulator while i'm also"
5316180,5321140," streaming so you know it's understandable kind of it's kind of understandable"
5321140,5334580," so yes yes yes all righty okay um so what we're gonna have in here uh i probably want to introduce"
5334580,5343940," the amount of rows and columns right so how many rows and columns we're going to have all right so let's"
5343940,5353140," say it's going to be board rows and 10 and then columns something like that so and all that is"
5353140,5361860," going to be obviously an integer so and i want to have this square cells build board that she described"
5361860,5369780," with board um so i want to have a square cells right so maybe because of that i'm going to have a cell"
5370580,5379460," um cell size right and it's going to be fixed size some something like 20 right something like 20. um"
5379460,5387540," when we are rendering the whole thing when we are rendering the whole thing we probably want to"
5387540,5396980," actually center center the entire stuff right so we need to come up with the position for the whole thing"
5397780,5402500," so to know the positions we need to know the boundaries right we need to know the boundaries"
5402500,5409140," uh the position is going to start i suppose in simple spots you can't have designated initializers like"
5409140,5418260," maybe we use a version where it is possible uh right so this is going to bounce uh right minus"
5419540,5426500," uh minus left so this is basically the half right so this is basically the half and we have to subtract"
5426500,5432340," subtract the half of the width of the whole board the width of the board is actually board calls"
5432340,5439700," multiplied by cell size uh cell size also divided by two to be fair i would like to maybe multiply it by"
5439700,5444420," half right because these two things are integers so you're going to end up with the integers so and for the"
5444420,5450740," symmetry we can do something like this uh all right so this is how we center it horizontally now we have"
5450740,5460020," to do vertically um so it actually has to be bottom top and this is rows there we go so this is the"
5460020,5466100," position from which we have to start rendering all of these things and it's already centered uh you know"
5466100,5472980," accordingly hopefully okay so we can start iterating all of those things we're going to start with y i want"
5472980,5483460," to iterate a row wise right so y less than board rows plus plus y okay uh semicolon i set so this one is"
5483460,5488420," going to be x x calls x uh right"
5488420,5501380," and so the this is the position of the board so maybe i'm going to call the board position uh and here we're"
5501380,5508260," going to have another thing which is called cell position uh cell position it's a vector two and"
5508260,5518260," it's more like can i say it's a x y but x multiplied by cell size and this one is multiplied by cell size"
5518260,5525940," and i wonder i can actually if i actually can do something like multiply by cell size and then add the board"
5525940,5531860," the board like position i wonder if i can do something like that i want to even put it like first here"
5531860,5537540," look at that so that's basically the cell position and this is where you want to draw the rectangle"
5538660,5546180," so might as well just put this stuff in here so the cell this is the cell position uh cell position"
5546180,5551780," cell size um this is another cell position um so"
5551780,5561140," position cell size and then we just render this entire thing so i want to call this cell rect"
5561140,5570260," cell rect interestingly so if we just render it like that we won't be able to see individual cells"
5570260,5576420," so let's actually do checker pattern right so it's super easy you sum up x and y and just depending on"
5576420,5581540," whether it's older or even you just render with a different color so that's the easiest thing to to do"
5581540,5589380," that uh right so we just want to see the the actual grid whether it works or not so animation in terms"
5589380,5594100," of animation i don't think we're going to have animations right now though um i might as well"
5594100,5603300," yeah let's actually get rid of that uh keys are not really that important uh all right so what else do"
5603300,5609700," we have in here i think that's about it right i think that's about it okay so now if i try to rebuild"
5609700,5615220," the entire thing let's see if it's going to work uh so there's some problems in here uh 37 what is it"
5615220,5621780," talking about 37 problem so it doesn't like primary expression before okay so you can't really do that"
5621780,5628980," but i wonder if i can do something like that so will you be okay with me doing it like that almost actually"
5628980,5637380," um so vector two oh no oh it works but we don't have a pressure plus between two vectors okay so we have"
5637380,5643620," a plus equals but we don't have a uh just plus so let's actually do operator plus uh right so it's"
5643620,5652260," going to be vector two a vector two b and let's just sum those mother flippers up uh a x plus b x a y"
5652260,5662900," plus b y there we go so uh yeah and by the way i wonder if because of that i now can do this kind of thing"
5662900,5667860," will it infer the type no i didn't infer the type unfortunately"
5667860,5675620," all right it works okay so there's a couple of warnings but it's fine it's totally fine don't"
5675620,5681380," even worry about that chat don't even worry about that chat chat chat don't even worry"
5685940,5707620," okay so that's really cool um what we want to do we want to have an actual board we want to have an"
5707620,5714740," actual board with where we can render ship a game of chess exactly so let's actually go ahead and maybe"
5714740,5720100," define um you know boolean uh board and you're gonna have like a board rows"
5720100,5727060," and the board columns and i wonder if we can just use size t instead of integers in here because"
5727060,5734500," that's what you're usually using here um okay so and how are we going to be initializing all of that"
5734500,5738740," stuff can you just like do something like this let me see so can i just build it"
5740340,5743300," compiling is it going to compile oh it's probably going to compile everything"
5743300,5750900," fuck me all right so while it's doing that we can try to do the other things without actually saving"
5750900,5757620," the source code right so we're trying to save a little bit of a time um so in essentially here instead"
5757620,5765060," of doing this kind of stuff right so we can do uh board y x right so and that's how we're going to be"
5765060,5772180," checking all this thing um well i didn't know you could create a new operator this is c plus plus"
5772180,5779540," this is c plus plus this is not c some stinky scene old ass language this is a modern c plus plus"
5781460,5789140," um okay so that that worked so that compiled there's a couple of warnings in here so um oh yeah so since"
5789140,5796020," we're using size t now it is complaining that we're not using these kind of things anymore uh maybe because"
5796020,5803860," of that yeah is it going to build it a little bit faster hopefully or is it going to be also 30 seconds"
5805060,5812740," probably also 30 seconds anyways uh so we have a board and um usually what i like to do right so is"
5812740,5818020," to calculate this kind of stuff into second secondary board and then to the primary board and so on and"
5818020,5823780," so forth right so this is the board and this one is going to be backboard uh right so the board rows"
5824580,5833780," uh board columns and all that is initially false uh right and um so when are we going to be computing"
5833780,5841620," the next thing so since we do the animation we actually wait a little bit so there should be some"
5841620,5849940," sort of a cool down after which we're competing the next step so there should be some sort of a cool down"
5850740,5856820," so let's figure it out i suppose uh let's figure that out uh so is it still building okay so everything"
5856820,5864740," seems to be fine uh all right compiled usb something yeah it's literally rebuilding everything so"
5864740,5867700," um okay"
5867700,5879140," maybe we can for for the time being actually what we can do we can do the computation of the next state"
5879140,5884260," on a key press some sort of a key press i think it's going to be easier honestly i think it's going"
5884260,5889700," to be easy um all right so we do the animate we're not going to do any animation or anything like that"
5889700,5898980," so we're going to do key down act on press not act on release so let's actually go to the game uh game"
5898980,5907620," loop uh and what do we do in here so we have a scan code uh when i do this kind of thing so scan code"
5908420,5915540," um space can i do something like that so if i do key down space i can try to compute the next thing"
5915540,5919220," so how are we going to be competing the next thing so we're going to be iterating through the board"
5919220,5927940," uh right so we're iterating through the board and then we're kind of looking at the board right so we"
5927940,5936740," have two situations either the current thing is alive or is it dead all right so it's alive or dead another"
5936740,5940980," thing is that we need to count the neighbors right so i can probably do something like"
5940980,5950420," neighbors count um let's actually follow the uh the style neighbors uh i'm going to provide x and y"
5950420,5959540," right and it will give me the amount of neighbors so if you encounter um if you are in a live i don't"
5959540,5970740," remember the game of life rules uh conveys game of life wikipedia uh thank you so much in luis uh for"
5970740,5977140," subscription with the message hey hey sorry for being late it's fine i forgive you uh thank you thank you"
5977140,5986260," for the solution um any live self with fewer than two neighbors dies okay so if it has two or three it"
5986260,5996580," stays alive right so if neighbors equal two or equal three it stays alive so we have back"
5997300,6005060," a board uh board uh y x equal true otherwise it basically dies and we can simplify the whole thing"
6005060,6017700," like so right something like this uh and if the cell is dead exactly three makes it alive right so"
6019780,6029300," i think that's how we can do it so if it's alive it stays alive it's two three but dies if something"
6029300,6033860," else if it's dead it becomes a life only when it's three right so it makes a lot of sense honestly so the"
6033860,6039700," only thing we need to implement is account neighbors and also flip the board all right so that that's the"
6039700,6044180," two operation flip board and flipping board is just copying the backboard into the front board"
6044740,6053220," um all right so let's go ahead and implement this count neighbors x and y"
6053220,6060660," so this one i'm going to call cx and cy because they're sort of like centers and we're going to be"
6060660,6071460," iterating we're going to be actually iterating the dx from minus one dx less or equal to one plus plus dx um all right"
6074740,6085620," right so an actual x that we have in here is uh cx plus dx and cy plus dy and we kind of want to ignore"
6085620,6094820," the situation when dx are equal to zero and dy equal to zero so when it's not that and we can maybe apply"
6094820,6102100," a de morgan law by doing something like not equals or this thing not equals but it's actually made it less"
6102100,6106900," readable in my opinion so i think i'm going to not apply the de morgan law sometimes i think like"
6106900,6113940," applying the morgan law makes conditions less readable even though it makes you look smart look how smart"
6113940,6121220," i know the morgan law and how often to but if you actually look at it it's kind of less readable honestly"
6121220,6127300," you have to put more mental effort into sort of parts there so yeah like i'm recently kind of stopped"
6127300,6134740," like applying the morgan law uh anyway so we have x and y but here is the thing is that um"
6134740,6141700," you can overflow you need you actually need to wrap around this kind of things so maybe i'm gonna just"
6141700,6151700," actually do mod uh we can do something like mod board columns uh right and mod board rows"
6152820,6159300," right and i'm using mode because the actual usual mode doesn't work with negative numbers people who"
6159300,6165700," watch me quite often know what i'm about to do right so there is a very convenient sort of like a"
6165700,6171140," property of a mod operator i don't even have a node where is the no do i have lua"
6171780,6184180," okay so does law have this law even uh freaking is there any scripting language that maybe i can find"
6184180,6191300," user local bean maybe there's some sort of a node in here yeah for some reason node is not in my path"
6191300,6198740," but i do have it in here yeah i do have it in here and one of the yeah so that's fine okay so one of the"
6198740,6207220," cool properties of mod is that if you overflow this entire thing it wraps around right it basically"
6207220,6211780," wraps around so if you if you are bigger than 100 right it wraps around starts from the beginning"
6211780,6216020," it works for the positive numbers but it doesn't work for the negative numbers right it works for the"
6216020,6220260," negative numbers in all of these languages like python all right so where you do something like this it"
6220260,6225380," will give you 99 and also bring to law i just discovered law can also do this kind of shit right"
6225380,6232980," but no js c c plus plus uh they can't really do that so um the way you kind of do that you"
6232980,6242260," do a little bit of a trick right imagine you have a minus one b uh right 100 and so essentially you"
6242260,6247060," try to do something like this right you try to do something like this to fix that you can always add b and"
6247060,6254500," get 99 but because of that uh this kind of trick this kind of trick doesn't really work for positive"
6254500,6260180," numbers anymore right so if you apply this for positive numbers they are broken so what you have"
6260180,6267220," to do now is to try to mod it again and you get a thing that works for uh you know positive numbers and"
6267220,6272980," for negative numbers as well right so this is kind of like a special mode for these languages where minus one"
6272980,6278660," mod 100 is actually equal to minus one but this is not what you want um right so in here we can create"
6278660,6287060," a mod uh where you have a b and we can just do a mod b plus b and then uh mod b there we go so that's"
6287060,6291380," what i want to do in here and it will properly wrap around because of that since i'm using instant"
6291380,6297300," everywhere so i don't know i don't really know why i decided to use size t probably because i'm using"
6297300,6303620," those things as sizes of the arrays and that's what size t is created for it's a type for sizes for the"
6303620,6308180," arrays and i decided to do it like that but i don't know i don't know like i'm a little bit indecisive"
6308180,6313140," from this kind of stuff none of that actually matters all of that is just a minor and important things"
6313140,6322820," so anyway so we have here uh you know the neighbors uh right and neighbors zero and uh"
6322820,6336980," okay i let's let's make a deal i'm gonna pretend that i never read that message"
6339060,6345380," okay and we're gonna continue working as usual like literally just explained what i was doing two"
6345380,6362020," minutes ago anyways so uh right so we have this kind of thing so if board yx um a plus b is enough"
6369060,6381780," that's what you mean okay i see all right fair enough fair enough fair enough what i mean"
6381780,6386980," is it oh you mean okay"
6386980,6396500," not enough if it's mine okay chat is wasting my time all right so i know the formula that just works for me"
6396500,6401940," all the time i'm gonna just be just using it all right whatever uh right so"
6401940,6408500," so if we have a board uh neighbors can be plus one uh"
6408500,6421300," like again freaking again chat is debating me i swear to god uh chat is debating me um"
6423140,6427940," all right all right all right so we counted neighbors and now we need to flip uh the board"
6427940,6434580," all right so i need to flip the board so int y zero less than um board"
6434580,6441540," rows all right so we're doing that and then we're going to be repeating that for x for x for columns"
6443620,6453540," for x right and i just do board y x backboard y x so i'm just flipping it i could have probably done"
6453540,6459380," something like mem copy i could have done something like mem copy but i think that's enough all right"
6459380,6465700," so that should be enough so we probably need to initialize this thing with something uh we can go"
6465700,6474980," ahead and just do uh you know board so in terms of row is going to be zero one so let me actually draw this"
6474980,6489460," thing in front of this thing in front of me um this is going to be true uh then one one two is true"
6489460,6496740," two zero is true one two this is the glider that we're going to have in here all right so let's go ahead and just you know um"
6496740,6505300," right so let's go ahead and just you know um rebuild this okay it's probably not going to build but i want to see the"
6505300,6513460," compilation of rules compilation of rules please give me give me give me give me compilation reports"
6513460,6524180," actually i just realized that i build essence on a completely different account"
6525060,6532180," and i just copy pasted the folder to my streaming account so maybe because some of the base paths"
6532180,6537860," are different it's incremental building feature kind of broken that's why it keeps rebuilding everything"
6537860,6542820," so i'm not 100 sure but i feel like it shouldn't rebuild everything because it's"
6542820,6546580," one of the obvious thing that you probably don't want to do you you don't want to rebuild everything"
6546580,6552180," you only have some sort of incrementable because next went through so much trouble making their own"
6552180,6558980," build system why not have incremental build that's twitch chat theory yeah everyone is a board in here"
6558980,6569300," everyone is a board in here um i think people generally just are afraid to ask anything in the chat"
6569300,6571460," because i will start roasting them"
6574820,6580980," but i'm a very passionate person like i'm doing that not because i want to insult you or show my"
6580980,6585780," some sort of superiority over you or anything like that i'm just being very passionate about"
6585780,6592660," what i do and it's just like i i can't control it sometimes like passion is something that i can't control"
6592660,6603140," sometimes um so it's just like it means i care about what i do all right i really truly care"
6619780,6625540," all right um so what we get what do we get um"
6625540,6637300," okay so that's kind of funny we have a glider at least which is not that uh wait"
6640500,6649140," it's kind of it's kind of moved but then did it even oh i know what is fucking going on"
6649140,6657140," i fucking we need to explicitly repaint that mother flipper oh my god"
6657140,6663700," okay okay that explains it okay that's funny okay"
6666740,6672340," let's restart so void manager thank you so much for uh tier one subscription with the message the"
6672340,6675860," sodding is on fire today chat can be neftok persh"
6675860,6682420," kind of an interesting um word how do you even translate that i i suppose"
6682420,6685540," impatient right so that's what it means"
6692660,6705380," fucking first try"
6705380,6713300," all right i declare a fucking success"
6713300,6721380," okay so i really like the separating system it's actually super cool uh right so the api is really"
6721380,6728580," pleasant to work with the idea with organization of windows and taps is also rather interesting"
6728580,6736020," all right i really like the projects that are just exploring new things not just recreating mess that"
6736020,6742340," we have uh already in our software stack but actually stripping all of that down and starting over"
6742340,6749300," trying to see sort of like an alternative universe right so what if we actually had time to think through"
6749300,6754660," all of the problems or maybe even apply whatever we learned previously right how we would redesign all"
6754660,6760980," that stuff so yeah i kind of like that it kind of tries to mimic chrome and what's interesting the"
6760980,6770020," application like chrome doesn't even have to build its own window manager or tab system just let chrome"
6770020,6777540," create new windows and the uh the operating system itself will manage it just like chrome and on top of"
6777540,6783220," that that tab management integrates with the rest of the application this is kind of a cool idea that's"
6783220,6790180," kind of an interesting idea i think right so too bad that it's kind of on pause because again so if you take"
