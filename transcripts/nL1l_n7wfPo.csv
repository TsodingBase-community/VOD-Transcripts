240,4880," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session"
4880,9360," with mr zozin let's make a little bit of announcement and officially start the stream"
9360,16320," as usual red circle live on twitch and what are we doing today on twitch.tv website did i"
16320,21120," even prepare the description i think i freaking didn't right but today we continue uh developing"
21120,29040," our own manim but in c with raylib and ffmpeg so today we're doing uh something special today"
29040,35040," we are integrating our small proof of concept framework uh with ffmpeg so we can produce the"
35040,40240," videos right luckily we already know how to do that because this is literally what we've done in"
40240,46640," usualizer so we can rip off some of the code from the mutualizer and just reuse it in our engine sort"
46640,52240," of speak right and that's going to be basically the topic for today's stream right so we're going"
52240,58960," to be integrating with raylib so let's take a look at the panium i developed a little bit this thing of"
58960,63440," screen because i mean on top of just developing this thing i also need to produce animations for"
63440,69120," my video right so i'm also like developing the framework and making the video simultaneously right"
69120,76800," i do these things simultaneously so i'm a huge proponent of developing the tool along with um using"
76800,83200," that tool simultaneously to produce something right because that's how you create uh you know the tools"
83200,88960," that are grounded on reality by instantly using them right so essentially you have a particular task"
88960,95840," you develop enough tool you develop enough tool to solve that specific task and then you basically"
95840,101280," try to solve more ambitious task and you develop your tool a little bit more and so on and so forth so"
101280,106640," it's constant back and forth between developing the tool and then using the tool right dog fooding yeah"
106640,112480," you can call it dog fooding right and essentially like if you try to force develop an engine and only"
112480,117600," then once you developed your beautiful engine try to produce something you will never produce something"
117600,123600," because you can develop your engine indefinitely right so you need to develop things with the purpose of"
123600,128720," producing something as quick as possible so because of that like i developed a little bit of a thing"
128720,135280," it allows me to make uh a little bit of animation that uh looks like this right so this is basically"
135280,140160," an animation that i'm probably going to use in my video right so it's a basically tape of the turing"
140160,145680," machine uh right so right now it just like goes back and forth nothing particularly special uh maybe"
145680,151680," it is a little bit too bright i kind of like this thing being bright uh but i also developed like um"
151680,158560," you know the dark mode version of this entire thing uh just for the just for the streaming actually"
158560,163360," because majority of the stuff on my screen is uh is dark so it makes sense for this thing to be dark"
163360,170240," uh right so i can actually switch the demon here rebuild this entire stuff uh right there we go and"
170240,173840," it actually restarted the whole thing but i mean it didn't really have to restart everything because"
173840,178560," we can't help reload things so we can have stuff like this so essentially we can just invert the"
178560,183680," colors of the background and the foreground uh like leaving the hat with the same color right so"
184320,189520," that's what we're going to have today right so it would be as already said kind of nice like i"
189520,194640," developed a little bit of animation now i would like to render it into an actual video and we're"
194640,200800," going to be using ffm pack for that right so the way we're going to be using ffm pack is basically by"
200800,208960," generating a frame and piping the frame into ffm pack ffm pack actually allows you to do that by the way so"
208960,213520," i think it's kind of a little bit dizzying that it goes back and forth like that uh it will be a little"
213520,219040," bit better it will be a little bit better if it actually didn't go back so i think this is the last"
219040,224400," two keyframes in here i'm going to just disable the specific keyframes uh right and i'm going to just go"
224400,228320," here and now it will create an illusion that it goes to the right indefinitely"
230560,237280," right so in reality it doesn't really go to the right indefinitely right it constantly teleports"
237280,242320," you can see that if you like actually like extend the size of the window but if the size of the window"
242320,248000," like that it feels like it's going indefinitely right so the way like you know this thing works"
248000,254000," is that we're going to be uh taking the current frame of the animation right so there is a way for"
254000,259520," us to render for instance into a frame buffer then we will take the pixels of the frame buffer and we will"
259520,267520," start ffm pack as a child process as a separate child process with an input being the standard input"
267520,273680," and then we're going to instruct ffm pack uh expect us to submit raw frames and we're going to be literally"
273680,281040," piping uh we're going to be literally piping the raw frames into ffm pack and it will simultaneously produce"
281040,288480," uh the the videos the encoded videos and stuff like that uh ffm pack cli is the api right so here is the"
288480,292720," thing there is a main misconception people think that you're supposed to use some sort of library"
292720,300480," or something like that no you're supposed to use cla people who um who tried to use the ffm pack as a"
300480,308160," library their lib av or whatever the fuck it is they went insane basically they went completely"
308160,316480," fucking insane it's like it's easier to just use ffm packs like like trust me it's just fucking easier um so"
316480,323280," same with cli i wouldn't say so i think cli is pretty reasonable right once you understand how"
323280,329760," that cli works it is actually very reasonable right so there's a little bit like it's kind of weird right"
329760,335520," so but you just need to know the trick you just need to know the trick reported to ffm pack twitter"
335520,342000," please don't don't tell the ffm pack twitter please don't tell ffm pack twitter that i'm using their cli"
342000,347200," library right now as cli tool right now because they're going to cancel me so anyway uh let's"
347200,355280," actually go to mutualize it and see how we do all of that stuff right so um we we literally have ffm pack"
355280,361360," header right so this is basically like a small sort of library that we developed specifically for doing"
361360,367120," all of that so it like the api is actually pretty straightforward right so you start rendering uh with"
367120,372400," a certain width and height with a certain fps and here we provide the sound file but this is because"
372400,377440," it's a mutualizer we don't really need a sound file in here right so because once i generate like a"
377440,384400," video clip i'm going to be expert uh yeah i only i won't i'm going to be importing that clip into blender"
384400,389520," where i edit my videos you can edit videos on blender by the way blender is not only 3d editor"
389520,394720," right i'm going to importing uh this video clip into the blender and i'm going to be overlaying it with"
394720,400880," the sound there uh right so because of that i don't really need sound in here so we're probably gonna just"
400880,406480," like adjust this implementation a little bit we're gonna get rid of the sound uh file and stuff like that"
406480,412400," and then what you're doing essentially you just um basically as soon as you produce a frame you just"
412400,417920," send that frame over like this function that's it once you're done producing frames you just call"
417920,424960," and rendering that's it that's the entirety of this api so this entire thing will create like a synchronous"
424960,431440," separate ff impact process that will just wait for you to uh send frames right it's also as flipped"
431440,438880," uh right i don't remember why right so because oh because because really when you read the pixels it"
438880,444960," produce the frames upside down so because of that i created special thing that flips them back when it"
444960,451840," sends them to ff unpack and to emphasize that i called it flip jesus software development am i right"
451840,458480," freaking software development uh so it will make everyone insane so thank you so much knupo for"
458480,463600," you at which prime location thank you thank you thank you really appreciate it will this api work on"
463600,474720," windows well uh i guess i don't know i don't know will it i never tried it i never tried it though"
474720,486400," so anyways um right so let me go ahead uh and just see what we can have in here so mutualizer so panium"
486400,491120," right so this entire thing is called panium and i'm gonna just like copy paste the header in here and"
491120,496960," copy paste linux version for now right because i don't plan to use this tool on windows yet"
496960,502000," so but i mean the version that works on windows should just work all right so and then here"
502000,508640," how are we going to be um linking this in desktop it we need to decide uh like where exactly we're going"
508640,514320," to be producing the frames so we're going to be producing them on in the main executable or we're"
514320,519440," going to be producing that in the lib plug so let's actually produce all of that in the lib plug so"
519440,528320," essentially i'm going to just like just add ffmpeg uh linux.c uh linux.c and uh in plug.c we're going to"
528320,539440," also include uh ffmpeg.h in ffmpeg.h i think i want to get rid of the sound thingy right and what the"
539440,545920," fuck is going on ffmpeg.c uh sound file right so here is the sound file we're also getting rid of"
545920,550880," that uh all right so and obviously this is not going to compile but that's kind of the point"
550880,555040," right so i want to go to the compilation errors and just fix all the compilation errors and stuff okay so"
555040,562400," what do we have in here cool uh so here we're constructing the um the separate process in here"
562400,568400," so and we are configuring the inputs right so here's the thing so here's that how ffmpeg works"
568400,574640," i already explained how ffmpeg cli works but i can explain it one more time because not everybody knows"
574640,584320," that so essentially you provide um first the flags the flags for your input right so you just provide"
584320,590880," the flags that describe the input file right so here we say the local level verbose uh it doesn't"
590880,595200," really matter it's sort of like a global thing right so we say that the input is going to be row"
595200,600400," the pixel format is going to be rgba the resolution is going to be whatever we provided the frame rate is"
600400,606880," going to be whatever we provided and then we provided minus i as soon as you provide it minus i"
606880,614880," the acceptance of the input parameters stopped and we're waiting for the input path right and so since"
614880,621440," the input path is going to be standard input we provide dash and then all of these uh parameters that"
621440,627920," we provided for the input sort of collapse into that one input that we provided so in ffmpeg you do not"
627920,635840," provide each individual flag separately you provide flags in chunks that's how you do that you provide"
635840,642400," flags in chunks you just provide the flags and you end that block of flags with minus i and minus i is"
642400,648080," a very special flag that sort of denotes the end of that block and there you go you provided the first"
648080,654720," input of your thing the first input then here i provided the second input without any special parameters"
654720,659680," which is like the sound file right we don't really need that uh right and as you can see in here"
659680,668160," we provided another bulk of parameters and it's concluded by the output the thing interesting thing"
668160,675440," about the flags of ffmpeg is that the output doesn't require its special separate minus all flag the output"
675440,683360," is considered anything that is not recognized as a valid flag of ffmpeg that that's the logic behind"
683360,687680," that right so if you provided something that doesn't look like any of these flags you probably provided"
687680,694400," the file path to the output and thus you can include the output block so here we actually provided arguments"
694400,701440," in two blocks the input block and the output block that's how it works why is it so complicated i wouldn't"
701440,706240," say it's so complicated actually it's actually pretty simple you provide things in chunks you provide"
706240,712560," input files and you provide output files before input files you you basically configure all of that"
712560,717440," and before output files you also configure all of that so as you can see all these parameters they are"
717440,722800," collapsed after you provided this all of these parameters are collapsed after you provided this that's"
722800,729040," it so it's just two blocks of parameters simply two blocks right so and here the whatever you're providing"
729040,734000," here is actually kind of like a global parameters so interestingly enough you can have like several"
734000,740400," inputs right and also several outputs right it just depends on how you end your block of parameters"
740400,746880," how you end your block of parameters do you end it with minus ipad or do you end it with just path right so"
746880,754320," so that's basically how it works right so and once you get a hang of it it's just like it starts to make"
754320,758560," sense right so and you can just pick up and understand how this provide this parameters and"
758560,767120," everything so uh yeah uh let's actually try to maybe compile all of that stuff and it seems to be"
767120,771840," working look at that it seems to be twerking so that's about it right might not necessarily write"
771840,776400," all of this so there's a little bit of a to do's in here but that's fine that is totally fine we're"
776400,783600," been using like a raylip trace look in here what the we're integrating with the raylip logging system"
783600,790800," huh that is very progress my friend that is absolutely progress okay uh so let me actually"
790800,796560," try to build it one more time okay so now we need to decide at which point we are rendering this entire"
796560,802320," stuff all right so that's a very interesting question in my opinion how are we going to be rendering all of"
802320,807600," that stuff all right so maybe i'm going to actually look at the visualizer just like to remind myself"
807600,815760," how exactly it is done so let's find ffmpeg start rendering yeah okay so here we start rendering and we"
815760,822720," switch to the rendering mode so i suppose we want to find something like send frame there we go"
823600,833200," uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh so we have begin texture mode and end the texture mode okay so we're"
833200,840000," using like a frame buffer texture to render all of that stuff this is actually super cool so this is like"
840000,844720," the texture is called screen let me find the plugin here and there should be something like yeah there we"
844720,852160," go render texture to d right render texture to d so essentially what we're doing right so we are just"
852160,859520," rendering the whole ffmpeg thingy into that texture then we're loading image from the texture getting"
859520,865840," its pixels and we simply send those pixels to ffmpeg and then we unload that image so we kind"
865840,870560," of do that on each individual frame which is kind of meh but i think i think the reason why i"
870560,875440," did that is because i couldn't really work around it and ray deep uh so that's probably fine"
875440,880480," we can try to do this the same thing in here so yeah that's actually pretty straightforward that's"
880480,883840," literally what you have to do so yeah let's let's go ahead and do that"
883840,898800," i'm still cancelling ffmpeg by ffmpeg on twitter okay it would honestly it would be a huge honor if i"
898800,905200," get cancelled by ffmpeg on twitter yes it will be a huge honor because ffmpeg to be to be fair is a"
905200,911680," irreplaceable piece of software infrastructure kind of like in a curl style irreplaceable but still"
911680,915360," but still they the whole ffmpeg developing community doing the work that"
915360,922000," pretty much nobody is gonna do right so nobody wants to do that work and they they're still doing that"
922000,927120," right so and a lot of people rely on them and i'm extremely grateful for like for them uh doing that"
927120,932000," work and i'm saying that not because i'm afraid of them cancelling me on twitter i i genuinely think so"
932000,936800," i think so please don't cancel me anyway so"
936800,943520," uh let's continue and so let's go to panim uh let's go to panim"
943520,951120," uh what if you're cancelled by react twitter i was wasn't i cancelled by react twitter a long time ago"
951120,955120," like i don't remember honestly like i just don't pay attention to them if i got cancelled please let"
955120,963280," me know because i have no idea um so someone has to handle uh 10 000 companies keep making up yeah"
963280,967040," so that's exactly nobody really wants to do that except them except that huge community"
967040,974800," right h2 um yeah so like i have no idea how to write this kind of encoders"
975840,980240," actually trying to write some sort of a video encoder would have been kind of cool"
980240,985200," like as an exercise just to see how difficult it is right so yeah that would be interesting"
985200,998400," so all right uh let's coin continue let's continue so to be able to um you know handle all of that stuff"
998400,1002560," to be able to handle all that stuff i think i need an ability to maybe"
1004240,1009280," how to say that maybe render this entire thing sort of separately because right now"
1009280,1015680," when i'm updating things i'm getting get frame time directly oh i actually do that through an"
1015680,1023040," animation updates right so we need to be able to update an animation in two modes in a real mode when"
1023040,1028080," we're rendering the frames and in the mode when we are producing a video where the frame rate is going"
1028080,1035120," to be fixed because what i think i think um you know delta time has to be its own parameter right"
1035120,1041520," so the animation of it should not rely on specifically frame time because when we are in a different mode"
1041520,1045840," we're going to be supplying different things in here right so let's actually do it like that so it's going"
1045840,1050320," to be dt and uh let's try to recompile this entire thing and go to the compilation error so"
1050960,1060720," uh here get uh get frame time do we actually do dt no we actually don't okay so let's try to recompile"
1060720,1072080," one more time cool um so that's basically what we're doing in here uh and on top of that on top of that"
1072960,1079040," i want to take the rendering of the whole scene in here i want to take the rendering of the whole scene"
1079040,1084720," let's actually start that scene somewhere here uh like so i want to take the rendering of this whole"
1084720,1092720," scene and separate it put it to a separate function so then i can call it uh on demand sort of speak right"
1092720,1102640," in different modes so let me see how exactly we can do that so maybe i'm going to have a function um"
1103280,1111040," turing machine right turing machine machine tape right and in here what we're going to be accepting"
1111040,1118560," we're probably going to be accepting animation um right which is going to be just a and uh probably"
1118560,1125600," the keyframes but i'm not 100 sure yeah we probably do need to accept the keyframes uh right"
1125600,1133920," so this is going to be k of s which is keyframe multiply point right so because we're accepting"
1133920,1139200," it as a slice so to speak we providing the point at the beginning of this array and then we provide"
1139200,1145200," how many elements we have in here right so so if i was programming in rust i would just accept it as a"
1145200,1149760," slice in here unfortunately we don't have slices in c so i have to provide it like this i could have"
1149760,1155520," created separate structure for that but i'm kind of lazy so whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever"
1155520,1165360," right so and let me maybe see so i want to probably move this entire stuff somewhere here everything"
1165360,1170800," related to rendering this stuff uh so we clean the background i think maybe cleaning the background is"
1170800,1176240," going to be fine right so we're cleaning the background then we're rendering everything else"
1176240,1183280," like so uh right and let's just put it in here i just want to factor all that stuff into a separate"
1183280,1192560," function uh all right so here we updated the animation right so we updated the animation then we took the"
1192560,1199120," animation value and then we pass the animation to the to this thing which probably means that i want"
1199120,1206640," to take the animation value inside of rendering of the turing machine tape right um so as you can"
1206640,1212960," see i'm literally hard coding specific animations in here specific animations in here because the"
1212960,1218800," architecture of the whole framework is going to be so uh your custom animation is going to be dll"
1218800,1225760," like this so file right so you're not writing the main program you're writing a dll that is then used by"
1225760,1232080," this engine to either preview this thing or render it right so that's basically the idea so and depending"
1232080,1237840," on like different animations you're going to basically have different dll's right so that's that's the idea"
1237840,1242560," at least right so that's the idea uh all right so what do we have in here so it complains about some"
1242560,1248320," scheisse i don't really know what is it complaining about so complaining about the length so probably"
1248320,1254240," because yeah so here we're not supposed to uh pass it like that we have to we have to pass it like this"
1254240,1260160," all right so what's going to be the next compilation error rw so we don't have these kind of parameters in"
1260160,1272000," here which is understandable so um we don't have rw but we need this kind of rw thingy uh in all fairness"
1272000,1276000," in all fairness oh i don't freaking know"
1276000,1285040," so let me maybe get rid of rw completely and just say that this is going to be parameter of some sort right"
1285040,1290880," so let's say this is going to be cell width uh what was that by the way 100 right so it was 100"
1290880,1297360," cell width 100 and cell height is going to be 100 and let's go through all the compilation errors"
1297360,1305040," uh just to you know fix everything up like everywhere we use rw uh we're gonna now use a width uh cell width"
1306000,1314000," and pad is gonna be the same so let me say maybe it's gonna be cell pad right so cell pad and where do"
1314000,1322240," we have pad a pad is actually width 15 of the width that's what it is so we take this width and we simply"
1322240,1332400," take a 15 of it so that's what it is um so pad equal we don't need that stuff anymore right so that's"
1332400,1339360," pretty cool so now all of these things are parameters so cell pad what's the next compilation error so"
1339360,1345040," this is a width and height so these are the width and height of the screen which is also an interesting"
1345040,1354080," thing uh i feel like this width and height should be also a parameter because we in the preview mode"
1354080,1359600," we're going to be changing the size of the window but when we are rendering the final video we're going to"
1359600,1364960," be fixing the uh width and height because of this stuff i think it has to be a parameter or on its"
1364960,1374320," own right it's going to float uh like this and like this and yeah because of that yeah it's kind of"
1374320,1379840," similar to fps right so it's kind of similar to fps that's what it is all right so what else do we have"
1379840,1386640," in here so this one is basically cell height right so this is understandable uh so what else do we have in"
1386640,1395760," here so this is a cell width and cell height uh what's the next error in here so cell size is defined"
1395760,1401040," somewhere down there let's bring this stuff in here and this thing is going to be basically cell"
1401040,1408720," width and cell height all right so width so height all right all right all right all right all right"
1412720,1423280," all right all right all right all right okay so we have unused parameter which is rather interesting so"
1423280,1431840," we oh oh this one is interesting right so since we're sort of passing it like that okay so maybe"
1431840,1444560," this is what we have to do okay and this thing was using the um so this uh stuff is rather interesting"
1449920,1459680," so this entire idea of keyframes is kind of painful in the sense that i don't know man i don't know um"
1459680,1467280," because it uses a specific window size but since we're going to be changing it since we're going to be"
1467280,1478880," changing it it's going to be kind of uh kind of um so maybe uh i'm going to move this entire thing for now to"
1478880,1484160," here right so maybe i'm going to be moving it to here for now then we're going to get rid of this"
1484160,1489840," entire thing and we're only going to be taking uh into account this kind of stuff right so this is"
1489840,1497200," going to be turing machine right this is a turing machine so this is internally available like so uh"
1497200,1505200," maybe on top of that it would make sense to have kfc count which is the knob array get kfs there we go"
1505920,1515120," what else do we have in here so this is going to be rw um that's a bit annoying so yeah let's let's do rw"
1515120,1522640," which is going to be cell width and rh cell height so it's a little bit messy but that's fine what i'm"
1522640,1530640," trying to do i'm just trying to sort of separate things so i can render this thing somehow all right just"
1530640,1537920," to render things so i'm trying to get some stuff done uh so kfs and it didn't like uh requires two"
1537920,1543200," parameters oh it's it's not array yet it's array length right there we go so what else do we have"
1543200,1551440," in here um so unused parameter okay so this is because we never okay we can we can do that uh-huh what else"
1551440,1561760," do we have in here uh so action update yeah this is annoying right so because uh let's maybe um"
1563840,1572080," let's maybe pass delta time in here like so to machine and in here what we're going to be doing"
1572080,1578000," afterwards what we're going to be doing afterwards we're going to be taking this delta time uh like so"
1578000,1585520," this one could be just done like this case if you count kfs not kfc uh and uh so essentially we're just"
1585520,1592720," passing this kind of stuff which actually converged to a very nice place in terms of uh api right so here we"
1592720,1598720," provide delta time uh and the uh like float of widths and height and so on and so forth and here is the"
1598720,1603520," state of the animation and we're making state of that animation using the keyframes that are inside"
1603520,1610320," in here okay so uh the refactoring kind of converges into a good place that i'm more or less happy with"
1610320,1616720," uh frame time right so let me take a look so this is the delta time and here we're going to be doing get"
1616720,1627040," uh screen width uh screen width like so get screen height there we go so let's try to do that and"
1627040,1631440," as you can see it compiles okay so essentially apparently what i want you to do i want you to"
1631440,1639360," move everything into a separate function apparently so which is fine i guess uh and so in here do we refer"
1639360,1645600," to aha motherfucker found you so we have to have to actually do something like that yeah so i feel like"
1645600,1651440," we should not use the state of the plugin like anywhere in here except maybe these kind of situations"
1651440,1659360," when we need the font right so when we need the phone so that's okay using the font is totally fine so um"
1660800,1668800," cool cool cool uh now we need to have a like a render 2d frame thingy or whatever the fuck it is"
1668800,1674080," right so let's actually see all right so this is going to be raylib and let me open uh this kind of"
1674080,1685680," thing so it's kind of like um render texture render texture 2d uh yeah i can create it so i i suppose"
1685680,1689760," i'm going to be creating that thing up front right so i'm going to be creating this thing up front"
1690240,1695920," uh where is the plugin state right so here is the plugin state so here we are actually"
1695920,1701520," loading the font right so this is very important for the zero in the cell and stuff like that right"
1701520,1706000," if we try to run this entire thing by the way we probably should try to run it because we don't know"
1706000,1710320," if it works or not okay so it still works right so we're loading phone specifically for this thing"
1710320,1715440," when we're using our yozefka right yozefka i don't really know how to pronounce that but yeah"
1716480,1723440," so yes so yes so by the way i i came up with a pretty cool way to sort of like reload resources"
1723440,1731840," and stuff like that so it's essentially when you are about to uh like reload the plugin right so when"
1731840,1737120," you're about to load the plugin i unload all of the resources that i have right now i only have a font"
1737120,1743680," right so as a resource i just unload them then in the post reload i load them back so that way i can quite"
1746480,1752000," like check things uh which is actually kind of cool right so um i really like this idea i don't"
1752000,1757440," know why i didn't implement like that in mutualizer because it's way easier than whatever uh like asset"
1757440,1763760," management system i came up with right so uh but i mean it's kind of limited uh but it's still fine"
1764480,1770560," by the way by the way by the way you guys remember the the problem with the current like hot reloading"
1770560,1779040," system is that you can modify things but you can't update the schema of the of the state of the plugin"
1779040,1784400," you can't update the scheme of the state of the plugin i came up with a limited way to actually uh"
1784400,1790880," migrate the schema right it's not super powerful or anything but it's a limited way that kind of works"
1790880,1798800," you can actually add um you can actually add new fields to the state so essentially what we can do"
1798800,1805040," yeah yeah exactly exactly exactly so is that like a common thing right i think it is a common thing so"
1805040,1812000," essentially we can store the size of the uh of the struct and if after reloading the size of the struct"
1812000,1817600," it is common in win api i know that right so this is basically the inspiration right so i just want uh"
1817600,1822800," like one moment like i think today right before the stream remember that win api kind of stores the"
1822800,1827520," sizes of the structure right so essentially if after reload it we notice that the size of the structure"
1827520,1835280," increased one of the things we can do we can allocate more memory to accommodate a bigger structure"
1835280,1840880," we can accommodate a bigger structure and just copy the old structure into the new place and since the"
1840880,1845920," new structure is bigger it kind of works right because we're appending uh fields at the end of it"
1845920,1850800," shuffling around fields is is gonna break it so that you will have to restart for this kind of thing but"
1850800,1855920," if you just want to append a new fields to the state um right without restarting you you can probably do"
1855920,1862000," that uh so i think that's a cool idea and i kind of want to try that actually let's give it a try"
1862000,1868720," why the fuck not uh right and you can't remove the fields that that's true that's true but again none of"
1868720,1874960," that cases are really important we're not developing some sort of like a service that has to work to"
1874960,1881760," 24 7 and never crash we're not doing that we just want to have an application that we can hot reload"
1881760,1887600," right so like once in a while and if we have to reload the entirety of it well fine right so but we kind"
1887600,1893920," of want to reduce the amounts of time we have to reload it from scratch completely right so this kind"
1893920,1899440," of thing allows us to not reload it very often right so if you just want to add a new field you can"
1899440,1904560," simply do that without stopping the whole process like why not why not just allow that uh all right"
1904560,1908960," but if you mess with that thing for too much what in that case you probably want to restart the whole"
1908960,1916640," thing and that's fine that's totally fine and because what we're going to be doing we're going"
1916640,1924160," to be uh in the runtime just tweaking different parameters simple parameters the speeds the colors"
1924160,1931280," and maybe sometimes i just want to try a new different font in that case like adding a new uh a new"
1931280,1936080," field in here is kind of a useful feature to have i think i think it's kind of a useful feature to have"
1936080,1940960," anyways so let's give it a try so when i initially initialize the plugin i allocate it right then i"
1940960,1945680," check that i managed to allocate successfully then i zero initialize it and i suppose after that i'm"
1945680,1951680," going to just set the size to size of the entirety of the structure that's it right so that's what we"
1951680,1958240," have in here okay so when we're doing pre-reload where we are about to get unloaded from the memory"
1958240,1964080," what we do we just unload all of the resources right so things like images fonts and whatnot right so"
1964080,1969440," all that stuff just goes away so then on the next load we can reload them so in the post reload we"
1969440,1973680," load these things again so as you can see in here right away we just assign this thing like this"
1973680,1979600," and this is something that we have to check if the size uh if the size of this entire thing"
1979600,1988240," is less than the actual size of the structure that we have in here uh right so that means the time has"
1988240,1992880," come to reallocate this entire thing the time has come to reallocate this entire thing so how we're"
1992880,1997760," going to be doing that so let's say we're going to create a p but actually new p right so let's actually"
1997760,2004800," allocate the size of uh new p like this so this is the size of new p so on top of that we probably"
2004800,2009680," want to you know zero initialize it i know about calloc no need to tell me about that uh this is just"
2009680,2015520," a force of habit uh then maybe i want to assert that this thing is not equal to no right so enough to"
2015520,2023440," that i suppose we want to just copy uh right this entire thing i'm copying uh p into np but i'm using"
2023440,2032960," the old size you see i'm using the old size so that's what i do uh and then i'm just do np"
2032960,2042560," size the new size uh and maybe this is where i i probably need to free whatever p i have in here and"
2042560,2051600," then i assign new p in here so that's what we're doing here though can't i just wait a freaking second"
2052080,2056800," can't i just like okay so this is all cool and all but why couldn't i just reallocate all this"
2056800,2067120," shit right so p reallocates um so we have to provide the new size in here um so this is size of"
2067120,2073200," yeah i can do that so and obviously i want to actually assign it like this"
2073200,2081440," and then just assign the this is much easier why didn't i think about it so"
2082080,2089120," damn so because realloc also will uh you know clean it up like you know free it and everything"
2089120,2096000," um so yeah that's pretty cool so we just reallocate it would maybe make it bigger so if it's actually"
2096000,2106080," equal that's totally fine but if it became smaller maybe um we kind of want to crash in that specific case"
2106080,2112880," i think we kind of want to crash so that means you removed some fields and in that case well oopsie doopsie"
2112880,2115680," fucky wacky uh right so"
2118960,2131920," so we can say trace log log error cannot uh migrate to new to new plugin schema schema"
2131920,2146000," uh schema because the size of the uh um to new to new plugin state schema because the size of the state"
2146640,2152320," uh became uh became smaller right and here we're going to abort this entire situation"
2152320,2164800," right so and maybe in here we can also do something like a trace log uh so log info migrating migrating"
2166240,2179280," uh so from this bytes bytes bytes to these bytes right and here we can say that all right so this thing"
2179280,2189920," is dead and we're migrating it to here like so okay it's pretty cool so let's rebuild this entire stuff"
2189920,2197840," let's rebuild this entire stuff and let's try to run the whole thing right so uh why is it standing"
2197840,2200880," i think we broke something"
2200880,2207360," i think we straight up broke something like what the wait what the fuck um"
2207360,2214800," so okay let me get rid of that so i'm gonna try to risk like rebuild this entire thing"
2216400,2222880," did they did they do something wrong why is it standing why is it not updating it was updating"
2222880,2227440," before but then now it kind of broke um so"
2227440,2238480," where did they break it for fuck's sake man freaking man what the is going on honestly"
2239120,2249280," um that's so annoying like um so i'm looking at a all right so do we refer to any of the a no we only"
2249280,2256480," refer it in here so do we update that a ah i think when we're updating this thing okay okay i see"
2256480,2262480," so that means we're okay so i understand why it doesn't work but the question is why it worked before"
2262480,2269440," then that's the real question like how did it work before then so i probably forgot to uh to recompile"
2269440,2276400," this and that thing okay so that explains it at least right so freaking freaking software development"
2276400,2284480," am i right uh okay whatever so what do we have in here uh animation value so uh so you want me to"
2284480,2290400," actually yeah okay so that's fine that's fine what else do you want what else you want so we actually"
2290400,2296800," provide it as a pointer okay that's cool so it is finally it is working okay so we fixed it we figured"
2296800,2301520," it out we figured it out chat everything's fine everything's fine so we want to add maybe some sort"
2301520,2307040," of like a new thing in here right so let's imagine uh so we need to maybe get some sort of a um"
2307040,2314960," emote right so what do we what we're going to take so this is sodium zesin so let's actually grab"
2314960,2322080," this entire thing so i'm going to copy three and i'm going to go into the resources and here i'm going"
2322080,2327600," to create images uh right so i'm going to download this entire image maybe i'm going to download it as"
2327600,2336320," sodium uh zesin png uh there we go use a new buffer okay so that's pretty pogue so it's still it's still"
2336320,2341760," running so that's actually pretty cool so here is the design so the cool thing now i should be able to"
2341760,2351760," um go here and in the state of the plugin i should be able to say image image zesin right and when we're"
2351760,2361360," loading the resources when we're loading the resources i'm going to say zesin load image uh resources resources"
2361360,2368400," images uh sodium zesin right so that's basically what it is and when we're unloading resources we're"
2368400,2376800," going to unload uh actually image p zesin there we go so this is what we've got so now i should be able to"
2376800,2381840," maybe try to rebuild just to make sure that everything's fine okay so everything's fine um"
2382800,2390800," fuck i actually commented out this entire thing we have no way to check that okay okay fine fine"
2390800,2396880," chat everything's fine everything's fine so let's go back everything is fine so let's go back in here"
2396880,2398960," and i'm going to restart the whole thing"
2398960,2407440," i'm going to restart the whole thing so everything should be working fine uh all right so now rebuild all"
2407440,2414560," of that so i'm gonna run the whole thing it is running it is working it is working so now as it's"
2414560,2422240," running it doesn't have any image in it we are enabling all of that stuff back we are enabling all"
2422240,2427360," of that stuff back and by the way maybe one of the things we have to do we also need to be able to convert it"
2427360,2435200," to a texture so we need to have something like texture to d zesin tech uh tax rather so but we are"
2435200,2442560," usually not using this kind of style so i usually say tech right so let me see in the raylib.h load"
2442560,2450560," texture to yeah load texture from in oh i can actually texture from file i didn't know that i can just"
2450560,2455440," directly do that like what the fuck all right so maybe because of that i can just say that this is a"
2455440,2461680," texture for some reason i always did this trick where i first load the image and then load okay"
2461680,2466240," so apparently you can just load it as a texture all right so we're loading this other texture then we"
2466240,2474560," unload the texture that's cool so and then uh in here when i'm rendering the turing machine i can here"
2474560,2484080," draw texture so and the question is where i can draw draw texture uh-huh so that's the thing"
2484880,2493360," so i can now do p zesin we're drawing it at zero zero with the tint of white which means it's not"
2493360,2497840," going to be modified so let's go through the compilation errors okay so everything's fine now"
2497840,2503040," at runtime at runtime i'm reloading the whole thing and i reloaded zesin without reloading the"
2503040,2508800," whole application right so and if we take a look at the logs if we take a look at the logs"
2508800,2517280," so what happened in the logs migrating plug state schema from 72 bytes to 96 bytes so it migrated"
2517280,2524800," the new schema so you can modify the state if you just appending new fields at the end of this struct"
2524800,2530880," at the end if you're doing something else we kind of don't support that especially don't reshuffle them"
2530880,2535840," don't remove them uh right so if you're just appending you don't have to re like restart the"
2535840,2540720," whole thing it will reallocate it and just like continue using it uh pretty sick yeah it's actually"
2540720,2548320," pretty cool uh like i only i came up with this idea today right before the stream right so it doesn't"
2548320,2553200," like allow you to do anything right but a limited case it can support that"
2553200,2562720," limited case is supported so um yeah and i suppose if you don't like this structure you probably have"
2562720,2569120," to leave it as it is uh right in the structure right just leave it as it is in the structure until"
2569120,2574160," the next restart right so for example i i just disable it and i'm not going to render it but it's"
2574160,2577920," still going to be in the memory right it's still going to be in the memory so i just reload it"
2577920,2582880," i don't render it but it's still in the memory uh if i want to completely get rid of it i have to close"
2582880,2588560," this entire thing remove everything related to that and restart it again so but that's fine that's fine"
2588560,2599120," right so um you know it's 2024 just buy more ram just buy more ram memory costs nothing let it leak"
2599120,2604240," we can even try something interesting like for instance i can go ahead and literally remove this in"
2604240,2611040," just see how this entire system reacts i specifically coded it so it crashes right i just want to see if"
2611040,2618000," it will crash in this specific case okay so let's remove that and let's remove that uh all right so"
2618000,2622720," i'm going to try to restart it and it crashed if we take a look at the logs what does it say cannot"
2622720,2628960," migrate to a new plugin state schema because the size of the state became smaller right we can also specify"
2628960,2635280," like how smaller it became because we print the increase of the size but we never print the decrease"
2635280,2643920," of the size right so why not uh so you bytes uh z u bytes and we can't really detect the reshuffling"
2643920,2648400," right so but this is something that i'm okay with right so again it doesn't have to be perfect right"
2648400,2654800," we're not trying to be like super robust and super perfect it's a very loose system it is okay to be super"
2654800,2663440," loose uh so yes yes yes but in theory you shouldn't need to crash if you're removing from the end"
2663440,2667280," that's a very interesting idea actually that's a very interesting idea so how we're going to be"
2667280,2677360," doing all that so uh so if you're doing a real lock and you're reducing the amount of memory are you"
2677360,2682000," reallocated or not is there some guarantee with the real lock"
2682000,2690240," hmm this is a very interesting thought by the way angel car this is a very interesting thought so if we"
2690240,2694560," look uh doesn't really but it doesn't really matter"
2694560,2699920," does it really matter wait"
2702560,2712240," hmm i think it's not even if it reallocates who cares honestly who cares so we can take a look at"
2712240,2718640," the man real lock like even if it doesn't relocate we can just yeah we can just allow that"
2718640,2727840," so because we already kind of have a code that unloads some of the resources here anyway uh in"
2728720,2735440," in pre-reload we unload resources anyway so that means if we had bigger structure and we removed one"
2735440,2742160," of the fields which was for example font and or image on reload that is going to be unloaded anyway"
2742160,2750800," so who cares and then it's going to be reallocated became smaller that is actually fine so yeah we can"
2750800,2753920," just we can just leave it as this thank you thank you so much this is actually super cool"
2754640,2761040," uh all right so for some reason i didn't think through that i didn't think through that but now"
2761040,2765920," it kind of makes sense so we can allow shrinking them as well the only requirement is just like do"
2765920,2771440," operations at the end right so append to the end remove from the end not in the middle or from the"
2771440,2783280," beginning or anything like that so okay very cool uh i approve of that uh so yes so yes so that means it"
2783280,2790240," it became actually even even more powerful now it became more powerful um what happens if you remove"
2790240,2799120," the field from the middle i suppose some of the um structures will be shifted and corrupted if you"
2799120,2805760," know what i mean they're going to be shifted and corrupted so we can we can take a look okay so essentially"
2807120,2812800," you can imagine that you have the following images so here's the memory memory goes from left to right"
2812800,2822400," and in the memory you have a structures like field one field two field three field uh field four"
2822400,2830480," let's imagine that what you did is um remove to this field right what you did is remove to this field"
2831120,2838560," so our system detected that and it reallocated uh reallocated this thing by removing the last field"
2838560,2848560," so now your code looks at field one field three and things like but actually gets the field two"
2850160,2856960," so uh happens some sort of a misalignment the thing may get worse if they are even different sizes"
2856960,2865520," right so again so what's going to happen is that we removed uh field from the middle but the actual"
2865520,2871120," memory is removed from the right and because of that all of that gets corrupted and messed up"
2871120,2876000," uh that's some interesting memory correction yeah but that's what's going to happen that's why i said"
2876000,2882000," don't do that in the middle uh right because we're removing them from the end and we can't really know"
2882000,2887040," exactly what you removed in the middle anyway uh right so we can't know that"
2887040,2896400," so here okay okay okay that's pretty interesting so what we need to do in here now we need to"
2896400,2903440," maybe start the rendering process of some sort so when we're starting the rendering process um we need to"
2903440,2909360," maybe have some sort of like a boolean field uh right so some sort of a boolean field"
2909360,2918640," plug rendering so maybe i'm going to actually put this kind of stuff rendering uh right so essentially"
2918640,2924320," i'm going to keep all of the resources at the bottom in here so then it's easy for us to like append them"
2924320,2929280," right so all of the non-resources stuff i think i'm going to keep them in here so this is a very special"
2929280,2933760," field uh we're going to keep it always at the beginning uh this is some sort of state stuff"
2933760,2938480," right so and this is the resources that probably the only thing i want to actually append in runtime"
2938480,2948880," uh rendering so and initially it's going to be just zero uh so okay if uh we're doing this kind of thing"
2949440,2956000," so if we are currently currently currently rendering we're going to be doing one thing in here"
2956000,2962880," otherwise we're just doing this machine uh okay this one is rather interesting because instead of rendering"
2962880,2968880," honestly we could have just used ffmpack pointer right so because it is a pointer right yeah it is a"
2968880,2974320," pointer so here we just have void ffmpack but we return a pointer to sort of emphasize that it is a pointer"
2974880,2985280," uh all right so let me see rendering so we're going to do ffmpack in here uh ffmpack like so um and if we"
2985280,2996320," are in ffmpack right if we are in ffmpack uh what we need to do we need to actually create first create the"
2996320,3006560," frame right so we need to first create the frame uh plug so render texture 2d so this is a screen uh how"
3006560,3017520," do i create the screen um render texture 2d so i think it's a load render texture load render yeah yeah"
3017520,3026240," there you go so that's how we do that that's how we're doing all of that um so plug in it plug in it"
3026320,3032000," um thinking how i'm going to approach all of that so maybe it doesn't really matter because what"
3032000,3040320," i can do in here is just screen um load render texture uh let's actually have the following thing"
3040320,3047360," we're going to have parameter render width render width and render height so that's what we're going"
3047360,3052880," to do in here we're not going to really allow modifying this thing between between the reloads"
3052880,3056640," right so but maybe that's fine maybe we will in the future but we'll see we'll see"
3056640,3068560," so render width um so what's the actual size that we are using in here i think it's yeah it's this one"
3068560,3072560," uh it's going to be modified in the future but it's just like i i'm going to hardcore it for like"
3072560,3078640," like whatever parameter all right all right all right all right so let me try to recompile this into"
3078640,3088400," i think that's cool uh and so we have a render screen so we need to do begin uh texture mode uh p"
3088400,3098080," screen i said screen so this is a p screen then begin um end texture mode there we go"
3098080,3105520," and i don't remember so do we provide any parameter in here uh array leap and the texture"
3105520,3109440," mode we don't provide any parameter in here and we have to do this stuff in here right so between"
3109440,3114000," these two things uh so here we just render it on the screen and here we're rendering that into the"
3114000,3118880," texture so that's how it works and in here by the way we're going to be passing not the size of the"
3118880,3125040," screen but the render size render width and render height this is why i wanted these things to be"
3125040,3131200," customizable like that this is why i wanted to do that so here we have uh we have to provide the fps"
3131200,3136480," right so this is going to be something like render fps i suppose all right so this is basically the"
3136480,3143920," render fps and render fps i think is going to be something like one divided by it's not really a"
3143920,3152240," render fps right it has to be render delta time uh right and a delta time delta time is going to be one"
3152240,3160160," divided by a render fps and the render fps is going to be 30 we're going to be rendering at 30 fps because"
3160160,3167280," i usually make the videos for youtube at 30 fps right i'm sorry we have a weak laptop i have an old"
3167280,3175920," camera so i'm just doing everything at 30 fps right because i think it's more cinematic right so it's more"
3175920,3182720," than cinematic so uh let's continue so what do we have in here 24 oh yeah i have to do that at 24"
3182720,3188880," fps to be cinematic god damn 30 is not cinematic enough all right so i'll think about that i'll"
3188880,3196160," think about that the human eye can't see more than anyway yeah sure sure what's funny is that like"
3196160,3201360," technically maybe it is true you can't really see like what's going on but you can't you can kind of"
3201360,3207440," feel it actually you can see if you insert like a 25th frame you can actually see that something"
3207440,3215600," happened there you literally can see that uh right but for example distinguishing between 120 fps and 240"
3215600,3223840," fps you can't distinguish that by feel you you will just actually feel that um right i have 120 on my"
3223840,3228720," phone and i can see very clearly the difference between 60 hertz yeah you you can see that but not"
3228720,3238720," really see that but feel that you can feel that um anyways anyways anyways anyways anyways anyways so"
3238720,3243840," if we are not in the rendering mode if we are not in the rendering mode how are we going to be doing"
3243840,3253360," all that so i suppose i already re render everything at what um just like you can't see air but feel air"
3253360,3259120," that's a very good analogy actually that's actually very good analogy so maybe i'm going to be hot"
3259120,3269360," reloading at h right and uh similar to mutualizer right so in here if you is key pressed is key pressed"
3269360,3277680," key r right so if you pressed r the thing we want to do in here chat we want to start the ff unpack process"
3278400,3285760," uh right so we're going to grab the center i think uh we provide render width and render height render width"
3285760,3300640," and uh render height oh height i said uh height and we provide the render fps render fps so and we just do it"
3300640,3307440," like that as far as i know it can fail if i'm not mistaken yeah it can fail so if and do we even report"
3307440,3313200," that so let me let me see so if something goes wrong we do report that and we just return null"
3313200,3319120," uh which is totally fine right so in that case it's going to stay null so that means we're not going"
3319120,3325040," to be in the render mode so we'll have to uh we'll have to check the logs if something didn't work okay"
3325040,3332080," that's fine i'm totally fine with that actually so in here uh after we're done with all of that we need"
3332080,3338480," to load the image and send that image so let me actually grab the code that i have in here yeah so"
3338480,3343680," first loading the image right so we first loading the image uh and then we send it so i'm gonna actually"
3343680,3350320," grab this entire thing in here uh right so like this so we're just loading the image from the texture"
3350320,3356960," then we're sending the center image to the ffm pack so we don't check the result of the end rendering"
3356960,3363280," because we don't care at this point right in the frame failed so yeah so essentially ending uh this"
3363280,3369840," thing may fail but we're ending it because sending the frame failed because of that we don't check whether"
3369840,3376320," this thing failed or not because we already failed who cares there's no point in checking whether"
3376320,3381760," this thing was successful uh which makes sense i suppose which makes sense okay so that's the whole"
3381760,3387840," thing the problem with this entire chat the problem is this with this entire we don't know when it's over"
3387840,3394000," when the it is over it's not over till it's over right so we don't really keep"
3394000,3400880," track of all of that or anything so we'll see we'll see uh so okay so let's try to rebuild this and"
3400880,3405680," test and it seems to be compiling so we need to figure out like for how long we need to do that"
3406320,3413760," for how long we need to do that so the animation is kind of anal in that sense uh so update value"
3413760,3420640," right so update value how do we do update value it's not it's just a you know animation update"
3420640,3427920," so animation update we're updating the animation so and the way the animation works right now it just"
3427920,3432480," circles through the keyframes that's what it does maybe one of the things it should do"
3433040,3440400," it should actually tell you that it's uh you know repeated itself sort of speak right it should tell"
3440400,3450160," you that it's it repeated itself um or at least that it is done so what we're doing here right so we give"
3450160,3456240," the animation then we get the frames and so on and so forth and so if the duration of the current"
3456240,3461520," animation is greater than the current keyframe we're subtracting it and we increment this entire thing"
3461520,3470640," and then we're doing this kind of stuff we're doing sort of the mode um so what we can do repeat it"
3470640,3478000," false and this is one of the things we're going to be returning here actually uh all right so if we're"
3478000,3490640," gonna get rid of this mode we're gonna get rid of this mode if i is greater than key fs count uh we're"
3490640,3498080," gonna set it to zero and we're gonna set repeat it to true so then this entire thing is going to tell"
3498080,3507200," you that it is repeated right so it is repeated or maybe there is a better way to do that honestly"
3507200,3513280," maybe there is a better way to do that essentially uh figure out the duration of the whole thing"
3513280,3520000," yeah that's better way to do that wait wait a second so let's go back let's you know cancel the whole"
3520000,3526960," checking the repetition or anything like that uh so it's not particularly great i don't like that it just"
3526960,3535120," came to me that we can just go for the duration uh right so that's way better if we're going for"
3535120,3540720," the duration so we need to have a function we need to have a function that accepts the keyframes"
3540720,3549040," right so let's actually do keyframes duration this is going to be float and we accept keyframe"
3549040,3556560," keyfs and then size t say sticky fs count all right so something like this and we can just"
3556560,3567360," accumulate all of that so duration zero like so four size t zero kfs uh kfs count uh plus plus i just"
3567360,3574800," duration plus kfs i duration we're just accumulating all them and then just returning all this thing"
3574800,3585280," okay cool um so we know the duration uh we know the duration kfs um what if we literally"
3586320,3590880," what if we literally make this thing global and accessible to everyone because we're not really"
3590880,3597200," modifying it per se anyway right we're not modifying it per se anyway so let's keep it like that"
3597920,3603600," so all of these things this could be just uh define"
3603600,3615920," define which is a little bit annoying but maybe that's fine so um yeah i don't like what i'm writing"
3615920,3623120," but i'm not sure if i can like really fix it anyway i just want to make it work for now just want to make it"
3623120,3633360," work so the only thing i'm doing in here is right i need to know the duration i need to know the duration"
3633360,3637680," so"
3637680,3647120," what is going on in here is everything okay all right hopefully everything's okay so where so since we know"
3647120,3654800," the duration of the whole animation right so we need to uh keep track of the rendering so we have ffm pack"
3654800,3663600," we have the screen and we need to know like how much we already rendered right so um rendering duration"
3663600,3671120," rendering duration so essentially when we're starting the ffm pack we can just do okay rendering duration is"
3671120,3678640," initially zero right so initially zero we're starting from here uh right then we update this entire thing"
3678640,3688400," right so and then we do p rendering duration is going to be plus render delta time like this"
3688400,3696800," render delta time okay and here maybe if p rendering duration"
3698080,3707680," is greater or equal to the uh keyframes keyframes duration where we provide kfs and kfs count"
3707680,3714480," this is where we want to end the whole thing right this is where we want to add and the whole thing"
3714480,3721920," right so otherwise we just do that so we kind of want to skip if it's like if it's done if you know"
3721920,3729840," what i mean i want to skip this entire thing if we're done with it uh there we go so we're in the"
3729840,3736000," duration we keep incrementing it and at some point it's going to be fine uh so andy author thank you so"
3736000,3740960," much for uh t1 subscription with the message it's a time for our own something i have no idea what that"
3740960,3747520," means but thank you so much for t1 subscription we appreciate that all right so uh let me try to rebuild"
3747520,3751760," all of that so it is complaining yeah because it relies on all of these things"
3751760,3758000," and stuff like that so i'm still thinking how i want to generate all of these keyframes"
3758000,3764960," right so i don't can't find the place for them can't find the place for them so right now i'm kind of"
3764960,3771440," relying on them being in a static memory uh but then it would be better if they were in dynamic memory"
3772240,3779280," if they are in dynamic memory if they are in dynamic memory uh how do we reload everything how"
3779280,3787440," do we update all of that so i'm not quite sure i'm not quite sure and honestly i think since the"
3787440,3793600," keyframes are kind of hard coded they should not depend on width and height and so on and so forth so"
3793600,3799440," it's kind of annoying that it does depend on that it's kind of annoying that it does depend on that"
3801680,3806000," all right so i think for the sake of just shipping this thing and for the sake of just"
3806000,3814000," making this entire thing work i'm going to literally head code uh we can literally head code"
3814000,3821120," the length of the of the animation right so at least for now because again i just want this thing to"
3821120,3827840," uh you know render a video for me so we get some sort of a base to work with right some sort of a base to"
3827840,3834640," work with so one two three so the animation is three seconds right so the animation is three seconds"
3834640,3840960," so let's actually put three in here like so um all right because i can't refactor all of that i just"
3840960,3846800," don't want to spend time refactoring all this i want to get ffm back rendering as quickly as possible"
3846800,3853280," once we have it working then we can finally like make it crazier or something we need to have something"
3853280,3858560," at least working right so because otherwise we can get stuck refactoring and refactoring and refactoring"
3858560,3866880," so it's not productive right so um let's see let's see how it's going to work it's pretty cool and when"
3866880,3872080," we're starting this and i think by the way we also need to restart the animation honestly right so we need"
3872080,3881040," to do something like maybe mem set uh so let me take a look at the yeah so uh mem set pa uh mem set pa"
3881040,3889600," zero size of pa there we go so we just resetting everything to zero we're just doing that then at"
3889600,3895760," some point it's going to be fine and to be fair maybe after we're done rendering we also want to reset"
3895760,3901040," everything uh we also want to reset everything and by the way after we're done with that we have to set"
3901040,3908160," this thing to zero and this thing may fail by the way this thing may fail so i don't really know"
3908160,3916560," what exactly we're going to do in here uh so ffm pack let me find what happens when you fail um so end"
3916560,3925520," rendering uh so in case of successive turns true uh i guess it doesn't matter honestly it doesn't really"
3925520,3932480," matter like we don't really want to handle anything so if it fails it will just print that in the in the log"
3932480,3938000," but we still want to do this thing anyway and continue working right we still want to do this"
3938000,3945920," thing and continue working so that's fine that's totally fine um okay so let's do that and let me start"
3945920,3955520," this entire thing all right so all right so we're rendering this shit fuck i remember this"
3955520,3960720," shit pixel data retrieves i freaking remember that this is the most annoying part of raylib"
3960720,3967920," this is the most annoying part of the ready i hate it oof it is just like it's so goddamn annoying"
3968880,3979360," okay uh so it logs every time you're retrieving pixel data out of this goddamn frame buffer so and"
3979360,3984720," like all of these things coming back to me yeah yeah holy shit and because of that i had to change the"
3984720,3991920," allowed log level right before i do the rendering oh this is so stupid log level it was something like a"
3991920,4003280," level yeah damn bro so i had to start rendering set trace log level log warning so info is not uh"
4003280,4009360," basically logged or anything like that i don't know why it is the default in ready i have no idea why"
4009360,4013920," probably because they didn't think about this specific use case but i mean luckily you can work"
4013920,4019040," around that right so you can work around that that's fine so because of that i'm not complaining too much"
4019040,4023760," i'm complaining just a little bit but not too much uh right so we're gonna do that so we still want to"
4023760,4032880," have some sort of warnings uh and then set trace log level back to info yeah once we're sort of done"
4032880,4040160," so we have to do that like in two places right so when we're uh yeah i wonder why we don't do that in"
4040160,4048880," here but that's fine that's fine so and honestly this thing kind of repeats itself so which means that"
4049360,4053840," it's a factor it's refactorable to a separate function right so as you can see it's basically"
4053840,4060400," the same piece of code in here and in here every time we need to finish the whole thing so yeah at"
4060400,4064480," some point we're going to factor it out to a separate sort of function all right so what do we have in"
4064480,4068320," here so it's going to be that let's actually start this entire time okay so let's render this thing"
4068320,4075280," let's go let's go okay we're rendering things it has to be 30 seconds by the way chat"
4076000,4083040," okay okay we're done are we good okay and we went back to a preview i'm going to close this into anything"
4083040,4089440," do we have output and we've got output mp4 chat so let's actually do a prop on this thing"
4089440,4097280," and see its length and stuff like that what is it length what's its length i can't see shites in this"
4097280,4105120," um three yeah we overshoot a little bit we kind of overshoot a little bit but that's understandable i"
4105120,4114720," think uh right let's take a look at this stuff this is a video chat this is literally a video so"
4120720,4128560," first try dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub uh resolution is 16 by 9 but it's kind of like"
4128560,4133760," uh like this one um so i don't really want to change it right so because the animation is kind"
4133760,4139680," of head coded around this resolution so uh i'm gonna like you know fix up the animation first and then"
4139680,4146240," it's going to be whatever resolution so yeah so i can generate these kind of videos this kind of video"
4146240,4152560," clips and then i'll be able to export them into the blender and incorporate them into uh into my videos"
4152560,4158400," into youtube videos so that's kind of the point so uh yeah i'm going to be modifying this kind of thing"
4158400,4164720," uh in here crafting the animation being creative right so i have all of the tools to be creative"
4164720,4172240," i enabled myself with creativity and yeah we're good to go we're gucci we are in fact tamaguchi it took"
4172240,4178320," me only one hour to implement that how about that how about that so i think the time has come to make"
4178320,4185680," what a small break the time has come to make a small break and uh refill the kapati so um okay"
4185680,4196640," so there is a problem with our keyframes we don't have a door freeze sorry so what we need to do with the"
4196640,4206640," keyframes um they are dependent they're very much dependent on the window window size the cell size"
4206640,4213520," the padding size like all of this is straight up hard coded it's disgusting i absolutely despise that i"
4213520,4223040," want to burn that code with fire but i can't because it's a useful code so i want to take that code and maybe"
4223040,4229840," decouple it from the notion of the window from the notion of cell size and stuff like that so what"
4229840,4238560," this does it says that i have to move from cell zero to cell actually this particular keyframe says that"
4238560,4247760," i have to move from cell zero to cell zero within half of a second aka stay on cell zero for half of a second"
4247760,4256960," okay in this keyframe i say move from uh cell zero to cell one within half of a second then here i just"
4256960,4263360," just say stay so the reason why i'm hard coding that is because i'm uh sort of like using this array as a"
4263360,4268480," format because i plan to maybe also save it into a separate file at some point and then parse it and"
4268480,4276720," stuff like that right i want the keyframe to be a basic building block of the animation right so a"
4276720,4281920," basic building block of the animation i don't know how good of the idea it is but i think it may work"
4281920,4287040," right so in the future maybe we're going to have an editor that will allow you to tweak each individual"
4287040,4293520," keyframe maybe there will be some sort of like a bezier curve associated with the keyframe and stuff like"
4293520,4300960," that speaking of bezier curves and easing and stuff like that i recently like off screen reintroduced a"
4300960,4308480," pretty cool thing so here is the animation value so essentially i take a t which is basically uh an"
4308480,4313200," interpolator from the beginning of the keyframe to the end of the keyframe and it's a linear thing it's"
4313200,4319680," just a straight line but look what i do with this straight line so i take t i plug that t into this"
4319680,4325600," monstrosity in here and i reassign it back and only then i interpolate with that do you guys know what"
4325600,4332240," the is this do you guys know what the is this this is actually pretty cool uh right"
4332240,4337680," uh so easy well i mean you can look at the easing but specifically i'm just using"
4337680,4344880," sign a chunk of a sign function for interpolation so uh so sign function so if i go to google maybe we"
4344880,4349040," can find the images of some sign functions yeah there we go so here is the sign function"
4349040,4360080," can i can i in 2024 just click on that image and just open it up and conveniently use it"
4360080,4364000," the answer is no like"
4364000,4374160," i just want that image just give me that image thank you holy it's so hard anyways so what i did in here"
4374800,4381280," so what i did here i took this chunk of the function from minus half of a pie to plus half of a pie"
4381280,4389760," right and what i did is that i remapped it from this uh rectangle to a value from zero to one and zero to one"
4389760,4396240," so then i just have this thing that uh starts slow then ramps up and towards the end slows down"
4396240,4398640," you see what i'm talking about it's just like"
4402080,4409440," so it it feels more natural it feels more natural so easing in and easing out that's what it is easing"
4409440,4415600," in and easing out and that's what form this formula stands for and you can disable this entire formula and"
4415600,4421120," you can observe very cool results because of that right so now i disabled all of that easing in and"
4421120,4423040," easing out so this is how it looks like"
4427840,4430800," can you can you can you can you can you feel that by the way can you already feel that it's so"
4430800,4441360," fucking robotic it is so freaking robotic uh but now if i go ahead and enable that thing right so look"
4446240,4454320," something broke but now it is more natural because it just ramps up and slows down"
4454320,4463920," so i'm talking about so yeah so this is one of the sort of principle of animation right so even the"
4463920,4470720," people who are like drawing cartoons and stuff like that they are aware of the fact that you need to do"
4470720,4476640," ease in and ease out for the emotions to be more natural and more pleasant to look at"
4476640,4481920," this is extremely important actually so and the reason why i use the sign is because it was kind of"
4481920,4488320," easy to just slap it onto the animation uh right so i just took chunk of the of the thing uh so maybe use"
4488320,4495280," sigmoid maybe could have used sigmoid right and here a sign also fine so basically anything that looks"
4495280,4500560," like this anything that looks like this will kind of work right so it will kind of work in here"
4500560,4507760," uh square so you basically suggesting to do square right if i understood correctly"
4507760,4514560," uh so square is not doesn't have this s shape right i'm talking about s shape so let me actually"
4514560,4530960," maybe draw that um so the shape that i want the shape that i want actually looks more like this"
4530960,4542800," right so this is zero this is one and this value also goes from zero to one so if you are using square"
4542800,4549360," as you suggested you it's gonna be more like this which doesn't feel the same honestly which doesn't"
4549360,4555200," feel the same because it's just like abruptly this just speeds up and it's just like it's kind of weird"
4555200,4562320," we can try that by the way we can try that just to get the feeling of uh how it's gonna go uh but i"
4562320,4571520," didn't like it i tried it by the way and i didn't like it um okay so we have in here um so it's a build main"
4571520,4579200," so as you can see there's no easy there is ease in but there is no easy another just"
4585040,4590560," so it's just like it doesn't feel good uh something like this is way better it's just like easy in and"
4590560,4600000," easy out it's very beautiful um yeah so i'm gonna leave it as it is then at least for now so i'm"
4600000,4607120," actually was using square for eapers maybe i should have used this kind of for eapers honestly"
4607680,4612640," uh for some reason like this is only recently i realized that you can do easing in and easing out"
4612640,4618480," with this kind of thing acceleration deceleration exactly exactly man what if i try to do that for"
4618480,4626720," eapers just a second can i let's port this formula to eapers chat this is a progress idea honestly i didn't"
4626720,4632240," think about that so we have some stuff in here i suppose it was just experimenting for some with some"
4632240,4640400," things uh let's go back uh it did it's it's it's stuck okay so let me see i'm gonna visualize this"
4640400,4645920," changes just in case i had any changes recently to keepers i think i don't think i did okay so that's"
4645920,4655920," cool so let's do build linux uh okay surprise ad stream surprise surprise surprise surprise"
4657360,4663440," so just waiting until it's all built yeah i just realized for how long eapers build actually i forgot"
4663440,4670480," about that especially when i'm streaming right especially when i'm streaming okay uh so let's start"
4670480,4681280," eapers and just see yeah it is doesn't so we're using square if i remember correctly right we're just using"
4681280,4692320," square for this kind of stuff okay so if i go into the source code eapers adb i don't quite remember"
4692320,4700080," where was the function that was doing interpolation i remember that i remember that some somebody accepted"
4700080,4710160," that so um in the game state in the game state we have turn animation we have turn animation and where do we"
4710160,4717760," use that turn animation ah so we have a thing called interpolate positions and in here okay look at that"
4717760,4723040," we're just doing this kind of shit which is understandable which is actually understandable so"
4723040,4732720," let's go back uh so i'm gonna open plug.c and i'm gonna grab this specific formula and i don't remember"
4733280,4742240," like sinf right so we have sinf uh so here we take pi multiplied by t minus half of a pi half of a pi uh"
4742240,4748640," then we have to so we have a stuff from minus one to one so we're bringing it to zero to two and we"
4748640,4756000," dividing it by two like so and so this one is going to be something like this so this is an alternative to"
4756000,4762240," this stuff we're also kind of inverting it right because it goes in a different direction so it goes"
4762240,4767360," in a different direction so let me see so it's probably not going to compile right away uh because"
4767360,4774560," we don't have a couple of things we don't have sinf we don't have since we do have floor like so"
4775360,4783600," so i might as well actually in a place where we do sinf i might put this thing in here so this one is"
4783600,4789200," going to be sinf and this one is going to be sin all right so i'm using the c function in here so"
4789200,4800960," c float um so t is what t is just a regular float so we have to do c float like this we have to be we have"
4800960,4806240," to do c float and in terms of pi do we have pi i think we do have pi okay so it seems to be building"
4806240,4810880," half of a pi is tasty it is in fact tasty i do agree with that"
4810880,4824720," it's kind of it's a very quick motion honestly so it's kind of hard to tell"
4826800,4836080," so maybe when i need to actually listen um what language is this this is ada"
4836080,4840800," i need to try that after the stream"
4840800,4848800," it's very jerky honestly so let's actually wait until this thing"
4851280,4857280," it's kind of difficult to tell so i think the motion is just too fast to tell if there is that much"
4857280,4857680," difference"
4857680,4865040," so because of that i think i'm not going to incorporate that but i'm also going to try to"
4865040,4870720," do that after the stream when my computer is not that lucky it looked worse actually okay"
4870720,4877200," all right so we'll see we'll see so depend i suppose depends on the uh on the goal right so"
4877200,4883440," depends on the goal for the game maybe that's better uh like square is better uh for for this kind of"
4883440,4893200," animation something else is better uh so why do you do divide by two with a half uh because it also works"
4893200,4899200," it's just a style i think you can say it's just a style yeah"
4900960,4905040," we can see your cursor thank you for reminding me by the way um"
4905040,4912080," now you can see it i forgot to enable capturing of the cursor right so you can just"
4912080,4917840," you can't see me you can't see me you can see it again haha"
4917840,4925920," it's actually kind of fun i disabled i think i disabled for recording something uh right so i think"
4925920,4936240," it is able to record something peekaboo peekaboo peekaboo you can see me uh you can't see me"
4936240,4940480," you can see oh you can't see"
4940480,4951840," isn't that isn't that what you subscribe for is that the content you subscribe for"
4953040,4959840," this is engaging right this is engaging content i'm a professional streamer um so"
4959840,4965360," funny tea today yeah we're just drinking some funny tea"
4965360,4969600," um so what am i doing yeah i need to do no but all right"
4978000,4983360," so what i was talking about i was talking about the mother flipping keyframes right so essentially what"
4983360,4992960," we have in here we are encoding movement from zero cell to one cell what we have to do i think we have"
4992960,5000160," to replace all of that shit with just number zero to one or zero to zero one to two or one to one and so"
5000160,5006720," on and so forth and i wonder if we can do that using a little bit of a emacs magic if you know what i'm"
5006720,5012000," talking about so let's actually find out so what i want to do in here is just um"
5012000,5020640," then i want to do um and then um and then um so that's what i wanted look at it look at it isn't that"
5020640,5027360," cool right so and it instantly became readable isn't it it instantly became readable so i just say"
5027360,5034560," uh for a half of a second stay at cell zero um right for yeah for half of a second then after"
5034560,5042240," that in half of a second move from zero to one and so on and so forth so right now this is not going to"
5042240,5049440," work this is simply not going to work because uh the movement is going to be very slight we need to map"
5049440,5056320," all of these values now to whatever it was before right to actual cell positions and stuff like that"
5056320,5061360," we can try to maybe run this entire thing and see what is going on uh we can try to do that"
5061360,5068720," you can kind of feel the movement can you see a little bit of a moment"
5069520,5075200," i didn't see enough movement chat i didn't see enough movement that's kind of the problem"
5075200,5083600," so i wonder if i can actually develop this entire thing now uh right you know with hot reloading and"
5083600,5091120," so essentially essentially we have this t right so which is the actual animation which is the actual"
5091120,5098080," value with like among these values right among this thing that we put in here so where we use that t"
5098080,5104720," might as well maybe put underscore in here so the compiler will actually tell me uh where it is used okay"
5104720,5112160," so t is unused in here that's pretty cool since t now is the index of the cell what we have to do we"
5112160,5120080," have to multiply it uh multiply it by the cell width right so this is a cell width now uh right"
5120080,5128000," but it's a cell width only um relative to the center of the screen so but maybe maybe it's fine so if"
5128000,5136400," i try to just reload this entire thing and there's something weird uh in here when i hot reload the entire"
5136400,5146880," animation stops i have no idea why um maybe because i don't know why honestly so it still kind of moves"
5146880,5153680," around it's jerks around but i can't see oh because it didn't recompile okay so that's fine uh okay so let"
5153680,5163040," let me move this thing here so uh-huh that's cool yeah and it's it literally stops let me take a look at the uh"
5163040,5180400," oh i didn't mean to re i forgot that i changed okay so that seems to be working all right i actually pressed r and it started like uh you know reloading and stuff like that uh okay so that's totally fine that is totally fine that is totally fine"
5180400,5188400," uh okay so that's totally fine that is totally fine now what i want to do what i want to do so this is a cell"
5188400,5195440," so this is a cell starting from the um you know from the beginning of this thing so this is going to sell"
5195440,5205520," width and so on and so forth um so what we have to do we have to take the size of the screen get uh screen"
5205520,5213280," uh weights so get the rate from ov ov rogue thank you so much for for the rate so how are you guys doing"
5213280,5219200," so what you guys been doing what you guys been doing so we're doing a little bit of the animation"
5219200,5225440," development here right so we're animating the turing machine it's kind of crappy the head is not even"
5225440,5233040," aligned properly but this is because we're just like uh experimenting right all right so we need to do this"
5233040,5240480," this kind of thing so we upset um essentially by the half of the screen and we have to now subtract"
5240480,5247520," uh the half of the cell in here to be fair i can actually look up how exactly it was before right so"
5247520,5253920," because i do have this information um right there we go so that kind of makes sense that kind of makes sense"
5253920,5262720," so it is upset by half of this screen then minus the half of the cell and then we also multiply it not"
5262720,5269120," only by half of us by the size of the cell but also plus padding so because of that maybe in here i have"
5269120,5276800," to do cell pad like so and i think that should be more than sufficient enough so it doesn't want to work"
5276800,5285280," because why uh cell padding expect expansion before dot ah yeah i forgot the the closing thing"
5285280,5289760," yeah all right so i'm gonna reload this and that thing and does it still doesn't work"
5289760,5295840," ah i i start rendering again so it's kind of classical situation god damn it okay"
5295840,5297040," um"
5297040,5301840," all right so that was interesting"
5306560,5314400," hmm i'm kind of surprised that this was not enough uh like it's kind of difficult to understand for me"
5314400,5321440," because so we are mapping this entire stuff so this is multiplied by cell width"
5321440,5332720," ah it's still minus okay okay so hopefully that will work all right still doesn't work"
5334800,5337040," still doesn't why why"
5337040,5345200," hmm and it's not even aligned correctly because it isn't that entirely the same formula that i have"
5345200,5355680," in here isn't it so if i just use t man what the is going on like it's like the situation is like i"
5355680,5363360," don't it doesn't work and i don't even know why i don't even know why um so screen width so we were adding"
5363360,5370000," this entire thing so we turn this entire thing into that and that entire thing is simply just a reflection"
5370000,5378000," of that where we took half of the screen minus half of the cell minus the current index multiplied by"
5378000,5387520," the whole cell width the whole cell width plus the cell padding um so and it's supposed to work but it doesn't"
5388160,5395280," what the fuck man what the fuck ah that is really sad game it is really sad again i have no idea why anyway"
5395280,5414800," so um let me maybe let me maybe think so let's actually reduce this entire stuff to something like that so we're rendering this thing um and it's initially gonna be something like zero right so it's initially zero"
5416160,5424080," uh all right so um so that is bizarre i didn't expect that to be like that"
5424080,5433360," i definitely didn't expect this to be something like this so what i wanted to be actually is to maybe"
5435360,5444960," um plus get get width uh get width get screen width"
5444960,5453280," get screen width and half of that uh let's rebuild this entire thing"
5453280,5456800," all right and"
5458560,5465360," okay okay that makes sense that already makes sense that is very cool so let me go now back"
5465360,5469040," and just say now minus cell"
5469040,5471680," width minus cell width"
5471680,5475840," uh and half of that of course obviously we want to have that"
5475840,5481920," uh and now now it points precisely at this entire stuff that is beautiful that is beautiful"
5481920,5488960," that is beautiful so now if i want to point at the next cell i have to add cell width probably right"
5488960,5494320," so i have to add cell width uh actually i have to subtract cell width apparently okay"
5494320,5502160," all right all right subtract cell width but we also need to take into account the cell padding"
5502160,5511200," so plus cell padding uh all right so that's pretty cool uh-huh that's pretty cool so now if i have"
5511200,5518320," some sort of index in here like for example multiply by zero right so this is going to be just zero if i"
5518320,5524880," change this thing to one if i change this thing to one it's going to be that so this is the next one"
5524880,5531120," then the next one uh the next one and so on and so forth so that seems to be working and now"
5531120,5536080," we can say that t is that specific index right because it's interpolating from zero to zero to"
5536080,5542640," from zero to one and so on and so forth slowly but steadily we figured it out all right"
5544960,5551040," so but we want to kind of upset this entire thing so there was some sort of the offset seven right so"
5551040,5557760," this kind of thing so maybe i'm going to actually put that offset to here right so because the reason"
5557760,5565680," for that specific offset is uh because we don't want the left side to be visible at all we don't want"
5565680,5571520," it to be visible so might as well put this offset a little bit in here uh-huh so now if i try to do that"
5572160,5580320," that looks beautiful and it goes to the right indefinitely right so we achieved the illusion"
5580320,5587760," we achieved the illusion and what's cool now what's cool now chat is that this definition of the key"
5587760,5596160," frames doesn't depend on anything doesn't depend on anything we can resize things it will just basically"
5596160,5601520," restructure automatically right so before we had like a very sophisticated sophisticated formula in"
5601520,5607200," here or anything like that but then we stripped it down to just a meaning that is the index of the"
5607200,5612800," cell that you have to point to and uh we're just saying that you must interpolate between these two"
5612800,5617840," indices and that's it right so that's basically what's going on in here and i think that's a cool solution"
5617840,5625360," which enables us chat it enables us to factor that chat out finally to a separate completely separate"
5625360,5631600," function outside of the turing machine tape we're uh putting outside of the turing machine tape"
5631600,5638000," uh all right so before we couldn't do that because we needed to know all of these like window parameters"
5638000,5643840," or shit like that like we don't care anymore right so it could be a global thing now uh it is a global six"
5643840,5651200," so this thing so i'm gonna do static uh this one can become something like define uh all right so there"
5651200,5656320," we go so all these parameters are kind of stupid so maybe i'm gonna get rid of them at some point so"
5656320,5663600," let me try to uh recompile this in that stuff uh yeah we don't we don't even need any or any of the stuff"
5663600,5670640," it's actually super cool all right all right all right so and this sort of like encapsulates this"
5671200,5671920," animation"
5671920,5687440," it shouldn't be a static because you can't hot reload no i just want to reload it surprisingly so"
5687440,5692560," maybe there was some other problem in there i think there was some sort of other problem in there"
5692560,5700640," oh yeah anyway uh so that's pretty cool uh but i want to be able to actually have like"
5700640,5707040," separate kinds of animations right so we have one interpolator which interpolates like one thing"
5707040,5717920," so we also need other things um right because this thing has different parts if that makes any sense"
5717920,5724560," it has different parts uh so maybe i also want to upset this thing a little bit further especially"
5724560,5732560," when i'm um you know in full screen right so in full screen now it looks okay right it actually looks"
5732560,5742000," indefinitely um so here by the way we have 20 elements we do in fact have 20 elements but maybe i want to"
5742000,5749280," actually have different values with within the cells of the turing machine that's probably what i want to have"
5749280,5755920," write different elements within the cells so maybe what i need to do in that case is just like"
5755920,5762160," store this stuff somewhere the question is where i'm going to be storing all that so how i'm going to be"
5762160,5771840," denoting that tape um so let me let me actually think so maybe we're going to have a tape that contains"
5773280,5780400," integers or strings or something like that so let's just call it maybe a tape which is going to be an array"
5780400,5786000," and in here we're going to just have something like this all right so if we're going to have 20 of them"
5786800,5797440," let's do zero one two three four five so this is five of these things uh now this is 10 of these things"
5797440,5806880," uh 10 20 right if i understand correctly right so we can even do something like this four it's actually"
5806880,5814080," too much zero five it's actually more than 20 i think i i think i did some fucky wacky but that's fine"
5814080,5824960," right so this is 20. so this is the tape and here we can do something like maybe excuse me tape counts"
5824960,5834640," which is going to be knob array length uh tape so we've got that so and in here instead of doing this thing"
5834880,5845360," um i can do tape count right so this is a tape count and for this text we can just do i suppose we can"
5845360,5858720," just say tape i all right that's pretty cool that didn't change anything but now we can just try different"
5858720,5866000," things for example what if i replace zero with 69 like so is it going to actually work yeah it is going"
5866000,5870640," to work it is going to work so"
5870640,5882640," that's a nice tape by the way that's a very nice tape uh the animation that i want to do is uh essentially we"
5882640,5889840," move to move to a particular cell we move to a particular cell then we replace that cell with 420"
5889840,5895760," and we move further and further and further so i want to be able to actually like modify certain things in"
5895760,5906560," there to modify certain things in there um right and because of that so this key of s is essentially just the"
5906560,5913680," the position of the hat right so maybe we can say this is a hat kfs uh right so where the head is currently"
5913680,5923120," located so we have kfs um so we also need to have some events sort of speak right so have some sort of"
5923120,5932480," events like for example when we moved from zero to one and while we're staying from one to one we want"
5932480,5939200," to animate changing the element from one value to another um right so that's what i want to be able"
5939200,5945280," to do so like i'm still not sure if this paradigm of keyframes is perfect for this kind of stuff like"
5945280,5955600," i'm still not sure uh but we'll see how it goes um so we replace 69 to zero and let's go uh let's go"
5955600,5962240," let's go so this is kfc so this is a hat kfc kfs uh hat kfs so it means i would have to change it in"
5962240,5970960," all these places where i do all that right so this is a hat kfs so that's totally fine hat kfs uh hat kfs"
5970960,5979840," that's pretty cool so if i reload all that it's back to zero it is back to zero okay"
5981920,5989920," so how can we trigger certain events or should we trigger certain events that's the real question"
5989920,5998480," in here that's the real question uh so we can have static keyframe"
5998480,6009680," so essentially that means that within the tape the tapes themselves should be some sort of objects"
6010480,6020240," there should be some sort of objects that can modify themselves right so maybe we literally need to have"
6020240,6031200," something like struct cell right and it basically has some sort of a value basically has some sort of a"
6031200,6040400," value um that interpolates its visual part from one symbol to another right so i can already"
6040400,6047360," feel that we're kind of move away from this entire keyframe paradigm which is fine i introduced this"
6047360,6054240," keyframe paradigm to figure out what i actually need uh right so that's totally fine um all right"
6054240,6064400," so this one is going to be um something like symbol symbol from symbol from uh and this is going to be"
6064400,6071600," is symbol two we're moving from one symbol to another one so that's what we're doing and in here i would"
6071600,6079360," say maybe we're going to have like an actual interpolator right so it's going to be sort of like a t uh and"
6079360,6086320," sort of like a duration right for how how quickly we want to do that but maybe it's going to be hard"
6086320,6092160," credit actually it's going to be hard credit so the idea of this interpolate is that if it's zero the cell must display"
6092160,6096960," from if it's one the cell must display two how quickly it's going to do that i think it's going"
6096960,6104400," to be the same for all of the cells and the idea here is that um so tape is a bunch of cells right it"
6104400,6110080," is in fact a bunch of cells we can even say that it's like 20 cells in here right now they're initialized"
6110080,6117360," with zero right so which is totally fine they are initialized with zero so i'm gonna move this tape"
6117360,6127360," somewhere here um maybe closer to to the plug right so closer to the plug so we have 20 of these things"
6127360,6132560," and when i'm initializing the plugin right so when i'm initializing the plugin so maybe"
6133840,6141520," yeah i think i need to move this entire thing to um here i think that's going to be a good idea"
6141520,6147360," just to move it in here so we have cells and there's 20 of them uh and they're initialized somehow or"
6147360,6154480," something like that so the tape count let's say that the tape count is going to be sort of like tape count"
6155520,6161760," count 20 right so we're going to put this entire thing in here so this is the tape uh tape count"
6161760,6170800," tape count that's pretty cool okay and when we are initializing the plugin when we're initializing"
6170800,6179760," the plugin we're going to do something like for size ti uh tape count plus plus i right so this is going"
6179760,6188160," going to be p tape i so symbol from symbol from to be fair honestly like i don't know why i added that"
6188160,6194240," symbol prefix right it's kind of redundant because we know the context the context is cell so we know"
6194240,6204720," what exactly we're talking about so from is going to be 69 right so 2 uh 420 and since we're setting"
6204720,6211200," everything to zero so t is going to be zero anyway so who cares who actually cares so that's totally fine"
6211200,6220160," all right that's cool um that is cool that is cool that is cool so here is the head interpolator right so"
6220160,6230640," here is the head interpolator uh and maybe because of that because of that the head itself the head itself"
6230640,6237040," has to be has to be sort of like its own state like like the tape"
6237040,6244560," sort of like its own state so let's actually do so instead of like having this hard-coded keyframes i think"
6244560,6254160," i need to model actual objects on a scene like in op style right so not really op style but i mean i like"
6254160,6260240," instead of having abstract mechanisms abstract mechanism that allow you interpolation and stuff like that"
6260240,6268000," it's better to have concrete objects concrete entities uh right so and that will make it a little bit"
6268000,6274400," easier um so i think that's a good idea that's a good idea in general all right so this is going to be"
6274400,6285280," sort of like a head uh right so and the head itself uh is going to be basically an index all right so"
6286640,6293680," and the question is like what index that is going to be so should there be something like yeah"
6293680,6302000," index and index is a continuous value which allows the head to move between this kind of cells and"
6302000,6311040," everything um so it's a continuous index and it might be in sort of like different states uh right so it"
6311040,6317920," might be in sort of different states so maybe we can do something like head uh states or maybe head phase"
6317920,6327680," all right so and the phases of the head are going to be um num head phase um moving uh hp we're going to"
6327680,6335520," call it hp for the head phase so we're moving uh and another phase is going to be writing right and the"
6335520,6341120," writing process basically substitutes the symbol symbol and while we're writing we're interpolating"
6341120,6347760," the current cell in here that actually fits perfectly i think that actually fits perfectly"
6347760,6351280," um all right that's pretty cool that's pretty cool that's pretty cool"
6351280,6362720," so because of that right so since we're interpolating we're moving from one place to another maybe what"
6362720,6368800," should what should have what should have we done is something like size t from two and that's basically"
6368800,6375680," the index if you are in a head in a head phase moving right if you are in a head phase moving you"
6375680,6382160," basically moving from that thing to another one uh and this one is an interpolator which indicates like"
6382880,6390080," how far along the way you are from from to two right so this is going to be phase"
6390080,6397840," sort of speak so we have a tape uh we have a head there we go we have these two things"
6397840,6403920," and that's pretty cool so in that idea of the keyframes is probably going to be obsolete but"
6403920,6410160," i'm still going to be using some of the cool things in the keyframes that i developed namely the sign"
6410160,6415200," interpolation right the the very thing that allows like a very smooth interpolation from one thing to"
6415200,6423520," another so with easing in and easy out and everything so keyframe so where is that sign yeah so this one"
6423520,6429680," uh this one this one i feel like i want to factor this thing out to a separate function right so something"
6429680,6435840," like uh static float i have no idea how to call that function right so but i wanted to accept t and"
6435840,6442480," simply return this beautiful beautiful thing right uh i really like this formula this is a very cool"
6442480,6448960," formula and uh maybe i'm going to even help compile a little bit and essentially what i want to do i want"
6448960,6453040," to just like do something like this and i'm going to be reusing this function over and over again so how"
6453040,6460560," should i call it nice interp uh i don't know so maybe synth interp uh right something like synth interp"
6460560,6468240," um synth interp right and so cool because now i can use it everywhere every time i need to like a very"
6468240,6476800," nice interpolation i can just use that and that's pretty pretty cool so sinful interp maybe so isn't isn't"
6476800,6484400," smooth step basically that but it's just like a different formula smooth i don't remember how smooth"
6484400,6488960," step in glsl looks like smooth uh step doesn't it remember"
6488960,6500800," smooth step oh smooth step is basically sigma isn't it wait this is a smooth step and it's actually"
6505440,6508160," so this is uh"
6508160,6516800," where's the smoothest where's the smoothest step"
6516800,6524480," i didn't expect to see that i did smoother step"
6524480,6531600," not a mathematician yeah smooth step smoother step this smoothest step"
6534160,6539440," uh wife exit yeah wife exit yeah remember that one i remember this one"
6539440,6545920," smooth step and what this one does it's basically cubic yeah yeah it is cubic look at that look at"
6545920,6547280," that choice and it is cubic"
6547280,6554480," maybe i should use this one um you know what that give me an idea"
6556240,6568960," what that's what's going to do it let's do it let's define a function called a scene step right it's"
6568960,6575120," it's analog analogous to a smooth step but it uses sign function because it has a nicer parameters for our"
6575120,6582080," specific purpose to or something like that i don't know uh uh those step"
6582080,6586800," those step dubstep"
6586800,6587120," oh"
6587120,6590640," whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa"
6590640,6597840," so okay so it doesn't work uh tape count oh i'd actually make it like this"
6597840,6606880," uh tape and tape now is a part of this thing all right okay okay okay okay that's pretty progress"
6606880,6613520," uh wait oh it's now a freaking okay i see i see so let's do let's do from"
6619120,6623840," i never knew i needed sorting beatbox into dubstep in my life until now now you know now you know"
6623840,6631200," i don't even know how much it sounded like a dubstep i just did a little bit of a vocal fry"
6631200,6641840," and just added a little bit of like a kick kick and snare right so isn't dubstep is like a basically"
6642480,6652000," vaults"
6652000,6659040," basically isn't it i don't know i don't have a musical education i haven't finished musical"
6659040,6661920," education so i wouldn't consider myself a musician"
6665360,6667040," it's a double time to step oh i see"
6667040,6675760," i see i see that doesn't tell me anything but i believe you i actually believe you so and by the"
6675760,6681280," way now what we can do we can basically synchronize our entire animation sort of to"
6681280,6685360," the phase of the head the phase of the head"
6685360,6693600," uh i think the only requirement is that wobbly sound no there is like triples in there i don't"
6693600,6707600," know how it's you say it in english but there should be like this"
6721040,6727280," something like that uh anyways i hope my neighbors are"
6727280,6730720," i just realized that it's a middle of the night"
6730720,6733280," so"
6733280,6735920," fuck"
6735920,6742640," and and then i am the one who's complaining about noisy neighbors um"
6742640,6746320," anyways cheers"
6749440,6755440," it's the rhythm of the night yeah it is it fucking is mate it fucking is"
6755440,6762880," uh so let me let me see so we have animation value we have all these shises so i think i'm gonna just"
6762880,6765360," straight up removal of that and go to the completionaries"
6765360,6771120," you didn't do much noise how do you know that how do you know that uh you're looking through through the"
6771120,6778800," lens of my microphone doesn't make any sense but i mean you get the point hopefully uh right so here we"
6778800,6787200," just do that uh so this is the animation okay what i'm thinking what i'm thinking let's get rid of that"
6787200,6797200," stuff as well um depending on the phase so we have to look at the hands um so maybe we're gonna do a"
6797200,6806080," a little bit of a switcherunny so head phase so and then we're gonna have hp uh moving"
6806080,6813280," hp moving um break hp writing"
6813280,6814720," hp writing"
6816320,6822720," oh cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool if we are in a moving phase"
6822720,6824880," all right i'm a little bit scared now"
6824880,6826720," uh so let me let me let me see"
6826720,6828880," uh so let me let me see"
6828880,6835280," we are a little bit so plug in it so plug in it so this is a plug in it we're"
6835280,6839040," initialized all of these things uh and i probably want to take the head"
6839040,6848560," and um puts its phase to um hp moving and where are we going to be moving in here we're going to be"
6849360,6853040," uh moving from zero from maybe seven"
6853040,6857360," to uh to eight or something like that"
6857360,6859920," what is my name it's an animation"
6859920,6866880," framework that three blue one brown uses for his uh mathematical videos right i really recommend you to check it out my name"
6866880,6873360," uh uh like this so he wrote that in python right so i think he opens it so"
6873360,6879280," i don't really know what's the relationship between the the money that is actually used by three blue one brown"
6879280,6881440," and developed by three blue one brown and this one"
6881440,6888160," um so does he use that one or does he have his own version uh does anybody know"
6888160,6894160," so because i like i think uh he has a"
6894160,6901360," github three blue one brown we can always check out like what exactly does he use"
6901360,6906160," he has his own okay i see oh he he turned into organization"
6907760,6908160," damn"
6908160,6913520," uh grant turned into organization so this"
6913520,6918080," really what the where is he"
6918080,6923840," damn i remember he had like a account or something"
6923840,6925840," all right"
6925840,6928320," i don't know no don't really know"
6931280,6935680," so there's no people in here so yeah there's no public members"
6935680,6943360," uh three uh three three b one b okay let's check it out three b one b that's his account"
6943360,6951680," damn he's got some sexy account three letter account like when did he he joined in 2015"
6953280,6962240," and he still got that sexy account maybe he actually joined yeah i personally joined in 2009 by the way so"
6964960,6970800," four four four and three i'm sorry yeah so if you take a look at how when i joined yeah 2009"
6970800,6973920," that's when i joined to to github"
6975360,6982800," i'm i'm an og githubber og githubber you're also organization am i i don't think i'm organization"
6982800,6990320," uh anyway so he's yeah so animation engine for explanatory math video so he has his own one but"
6990320,6995680," since it's open source people just took this thing and sort of forked it and made their own like a"
6995680,7001680," community maintained version so manim is an engine for precise programmatic animations designed for"
7001680,7007440," creating explanatory math videos now that there are two versions of manim uh this repository began as a"
7007440,7013200," personal project by the author of 3blue1brown for the purpose of animation those uh those videos with"
7013200,7020080," specific code available here in 2020 a group of developers forked uh it into what is now a community"
7020080,7025680," edition okay a community edition a separate thing all right that makes sense with the goal of being"
7025680,7030720," more stable better tested quicker to respond to community contributions and all around friendlier"
7030720,7037760," to get started with uh see this page for module this is actually a very cool idea right so it's just like"
7037760,7045920," he's not gonna be doing open source maintenance like he has no time to do that absolutely right so it's"
7045920,7051600," better like that somebody else does that so he has he has his own sort of version he maintains and stuff"
7051600,7056800," like that and for everyone else it's just like this thing and i suppose maybe they once in a while"
7056800,7062000," incorporate his changes from here or something like that but that's a very cool dynamics between like"
7062000,7069120," you know between him and this community and stuff like that um so that's pretty cool it's very cool"
7070080,7075280," so i'm gonna start this one as well right because i start this one long time ago i remember that right"
7075280,7080320," so i think i started way before like my community edition existed but i'm gonna start this one too"
7080320,7087200," pretty cool pretty cool and the reason why i'm making my own one is because i just don't want to learn my new"
7089680,7094720," what's funny is that it's kind of funny like i reached the point where it's simply easier for"
7094720,7100720," me to just develop my own thing from scratch rather than during someone else software right so to learn"
7100720,7104880," someone else software you're just like you have to read the commentation you have to spend so much"
7104880,7110880," freaking effort it's easier for me to just like write the code that does the job like it's just like yeah"
7110880,7111360," whatever"
7114240,7118960," because of that i'm writing this thing it's like it's easier for me like i know exactly what i want"
7118960,7123360," i know exactly what i want i just write it down and make the computer do the thing"
7123360,7128480," rather than learning someone else take on the problem because that's what it is"
7128480,7134560," someone else software is just someone else take on the solution of the problem and now i have to study"
7134560,7140720," that take i have to internalize that take right and stuff like that i want to do that i have my own"
7140720,7145280," take on how to do this so i'm gonna just write it down uh so"
7145280,7153520," and no limitations and stuff like that yeah yeah yeah so anyways"
7153520,7162080," and maybe this thing will evolve into something else as far as i know my name is like uses heavily like"
7162080,7168160," op features of python so it's pretty much like an op framework right so here we have a very imperative"
7168160,7173280," thing instead so i wonder how this thing will evolve in the future we'll see we'll see"
7173280,7183120," um right okay so what do we have in here so this is t cool uh yeah so we have different"
7183120,7190560," phases and stuff like that so if we are moving uh right if we are moving what i want to do is"
7191680,7200000," basically yeah what if i factor out this entire thing to just a separate function uh i don't know"
7200000,7204560," how to call that uh turing machine let's call this turing machine"
7204560,7215520," but maybe because this is already the turing machine so i don't freaking know if i want to factor it out"
7215520,7222560," all right so i just i'm running out of names for functions to call but anyway uh and maybe"
7222560,7229280," honestly i can just render it in here and update the actual thing somewhere here"
7229280,7237840," yeah that kind of makes sense so essentially we just have t in here which is going to be initially zero"
7237840,7246720," and if we are in the moving phase what do we do we take head uh right and since we're moving from to two"
7246720,7249680," i just do from"
7249680,7260160," from and two and we need some sort of a parameter so this is going to be"
7260160,7268240," head moving duration right it's going to be half of the second right so this is a half of a second"
7268240,7271040," so that means i have a t"
7271040,7283360," and t is an interpolator from zero to one it is interpolated from zero to one so that means what i"
7283360,7289440," want to do in reality i want to map it from zero to the duration of the entire thing then i want to add"
7289440,7295040," the frame not really the frame but delta time that the time is actually passed in here as the parameter"
7295040,7304240," okay so that makes sense uh that's very cool and then head moving duration so i mapped it i updated this"
7304240,7311040," entire stuff so then afterwards i can divide this entire stuff back by head moving and that's the new"
7311040,7317120," value for the t of the hat right so that's the new value for the t of the hat which i might actually"
7318880,7327360," assign to assign to t but t is going to be more like um the actual position of the hat so essentially"
7327360,7334320," what we do so this is the interpolator from zero to one so i take head um you know from"
7340960,7352640," from uh two to both of them i want to actually make them floats in here so these are the floats uh then"
7352640,7361040," i want to multiply this entire thing by that but maybe i'm going to also do since step in here i think"
7361040,7366480," since step is very much useful in this specific case it's a little bit weird but i mean that's fine so"
7366480,7372720," so there's also a situation when this thing becomes greater or equal to one all right if this thing is"
7372720,7382640," greater to equal to one um that just means uh we've we're done with this animation right so what we have to"
7382640,7387520," do now is we have to switch um from"
7387520,7396800," to two and we have to switch the phase i have to switch the phase to hp writing"
7396800,7405600," so that's what we're doing here and in hp writing in hp writing we assign t uh p had from"
7406400,7412880," like this uh it's gonna be float and we just reuse that t for the rest of the things"
7412880,7418800," um okay so that basically moves from one place to another okay"
7418800,7427840," so okay so we yeah we don't need animation anymore so we're kind of getting rid of the animation"
7427840,7434880," thing at all uh so maybe might as well just get rid of these things um completely and"
7434880,7439280," yeah something like this"
7439280,7447200," uh simulating simulating all of these objects that i want to animate directly is actually way better in"
7447200,7455920," my opinion it is actually way better uh okay oof oof oof so rendering duration that's totally fine so when"
7455920,7465120," we're resetting this entire thing when we are resetting this entire thing so maybe the way we reset is"
7465120,7474800," going to be basically redo that entire thing ha i really like that so let me do the following thing"
7474800,7484320," reset animation uh reset animation and i'm going to do something like this"
7486720,7490800," so all of that so all of that is related to the animation so we load the resources we reset animation"
7490800,7501280," that's cool so we do that and in terms of the p had c is we're going to make it equal to zero"
7501280,7508160," so and now every time we're sort of like setting duration and stuff like that and resetting this to"
7508160,7517120," zero what we can do instead reset animation reset animation and just reset animation"
7517120,7522960," uh reset animation and reset animation"
7522960,7531360," what else do we have turing tape okay so this is the function so it's just called turing machine uh the one"
7531360,7536960," uh the one that we're animating and we don't even have to pass anything we just pass delta time"
7536960,7543360," fix the delta time because we're producing the video fixed width and fixed height but since we are like"
7543360,7549360," sort of this like decoupled width from the specific parameters we can actually quite easily customize all"
7549360,7557040," that so all right and here is the similar thing but here since we're previewing we're taking the frame"
7557040,7562960," time and of the window width of the window and height of the window right so look at that"
7563680,7571840," so it's not tape look so this is when we're producing the video all of these things are fixed and this is"
7571840,7578160," when we are previewing so but this is the same function right but in one case the parameters hard"
7578160,7583440," coded right because it's a video like a specific video and this one is dynamic thing and because of"
7583440,7588560," that we're taking these things dynamically right so this function doesn't know whether it's rendered"
7588560,7592480," on the window or it's rendered in the video it's kind of similar to visualizer we had the same problem"
7592480,7600160," visualizer it's the same solution essentially just abstracting away that uh essentially and sensually"
7600160,7605280," and sensually all right so what do we have in here and that seems to be compounding that's pretty cool"
7605280,7615520," uh that is very very cool and when we're in a writing state by the way we should be probably"
7615520,7621280," animating the um you know the head the the cell specific cell"
7622480,7628960," um so we need to be animating this specific cell how are we going to be doing all that this is"
7628960,7634960," actually kind of interesting so uh we're switching to two"
7634960,7644320," and as we go to two maybe that's fine okay let's actually see if like a single iteration it's actually"
7644320,7652160," went backwards is this did i really freaking coded that yes no i didn't so we went from seven to eight"
7652160,7656080," um so it went backwards"
7656080,7658560," what"
7658560,7666800," uh am i an idiot i think i'm an idiot uh yeah i think i am from"
7668320,7680800," so this is was from um i don't see from yeah so when i'm interpolating yeah why am i subtracting this"
7680800,7692080," entire stuff why am i subtracting this entire stuff i suppose what i have to do is then so two"
7694240,7701920," from that's the distance between them that's the distance between them as then i have to uh just"
7701920,7708240," add this entire stuff like that so that's what i want to do in here right so that makes sense"
7708240,7716560," okay so one step is actually moving like to there one step is actually moving to there so we also have"
7716560,7721200," enough sets an annoying of set that we probably don't need because i already baked that i've set in here"
7721200,7730640," so it is not needed so now if i just do that all right that's cool that is very cool and i started"
7730640,7738720," rendering i should have not actually started rendering uh okay um where is my stuff where is my stuff"
7738720,7747440," just a second i removed the offset right i removed the offset so now yeah it's in the perfect"
7747440,7755360," place it's actually here cool cool so now what i want to do chat what i want to do i want to"
7755360,7765040," basically start updating the cell if i'm in a writing i'm updating the current cell i'm updating the current"
7765040,7777200," cell uh so essentially p uh tape p tape head so we take head from that's the current index of this"
7777200,7783760," entire thing uh it's already initialized with prompt to two but just in case one initialize it's zero"
7783760,7790480," right so this is basically what i want to do all right so in here when we're writing when we are"
7790480,7798880," writing um we take this thing uh and we're gonna use head moving duration it's gonna be the same duration"
7798880,7803040," for writing and moving right so we're gonna use the same thing and we're gonna just update this thing"
7803040,7810480," we're gonna add it like that and remap it back like this and reassign it back like this there we go so"
7810480,7821760," that's what we do um cool and at some point right at some point this thing basically becomes great uh"
7821760,7829120," yeah greater or equal to one and we have to switch to a different situation right so we have to switch to this"
7829120,7836960," different mode so we're gonna do head from uh whatever we are but we're gonna be moving to"
7836960,7846000," head from plus one we're moving to the next one you see what we're doing here you see what we're doing"
7846000,7853040," that's what we're doing so and then we're gonna reset the heads interpolator and the heads interpolator"
7853040,7859520," and we're switching the heads phase to hp moving right so we have some sort of like a state machine"
7859520,7865280," here you see right we saw the state machine so it's kind of better right so we can do these kind of"
7865280,7874880," things programmatically and stuff like that i like that i really like that okay uh and then if that will"
7874880,7880720," bring it back to here right bring it back to here and it will move to the next one then switch back to here"
7880720,7887200," and it just like flip-flops between moving writing moving writing and here is the funny part right so"
7887200,7894480," we need to use that interpolator within the cell to properly um interpolate the text right to properly"
7894480,7908800," interpolate the text so we have the text from so the bigger so if it's zero it has to be from if it's uh one it has to be two"
7908800,7916400," um so the bigger the value the more paint the more paint the sign from has to be so i can actually want"
7916400,7924720," to call this from text right so this is a from text uh right so because we're going to have two of them"
7924720,7931280," we're going to be rendering two of them in fact uh so the measure text and this is just a from um"
7931280,7936480," um the the way i want to do that actually the way i want to do that is maybe"
7936480,7942960," uh this is the font size so maybe i can take"
7942960,7955200," tape i and it's t uh and i can invert that so that way the bigger the value the smaller this thing will"
7955200,7963760," become and i can effectively i can effectively maybe multiply this entire thing by the font size"
7963760,7971120," so it will shrink so as the animation goes further it's going to shrink"
7973120,7979840," all right so uh are we still playing now we're we're not playing so now if i try to run this entire"
7979840,7987280," thing and i'm going to just try to do that aha i see what's going on i see what's going on so it kind"
7987280,7993600," of worked i really like that so we can do font size which is going to be float form size we're going to"
7993600,8001680," assign it in here and the font size in here right so it just upset it a little bit right so let me see"
8001680,8010320," i think it's going to crash at some point"
8010320,8023440," you know that's why you program in rust by the way so that's why you program in rust"
8023440,8030240," because it literally went out of bounds it it was so cool it became it started to become glitchy"
8030240,8037040," because it started to corrupt its own memory we literally we literally saw buffer overflow what the"
8037040,8044000," fuck because we were uh rendering the buffer and then we didn't we didn't have like a out of bounds check"
8044000,8048480," and it started to corrupt everything and just eventually fell apart what the fuck this was so"
8048480,8053280," cool i want to see that one more time uh i want to see that one more time this is what"
8053280,8060480," rust developers want you to miss if you program in rust you're missing all these beautiful"
8060480,8066320," educational moments you're not gonna learn about any of that stuff rust developers don't want you to see"
8066320,8072640," any of that cool shit i'm telling you i'm freaking telling you anyway so let's actually start that one"
8072640,8077840," one more time so we're consuming 69s we are just consuming 69s"
8077840,8084000," right such gatekeepers i swear to god true true look at that"
8088800,8095040," that is so cool i love it and it just sick faulted yeah yeah so it it down below it said sick fault okay"
8095040,8102640," so one of the things we can do and one of the things we can do we can maybe introduce uh another thing in"
8102640,8110560," here called halt uh and i wonder by the way is the compilation uh is going to uh no uh yeah it's actually"
8110560,8122720," warn me so that that's cool that's cool so halt uh case hp halt all right and in halt we just do that"
8123760,8139120," so if if if this thing is greater recoil than the tape count we are simply switching to"
8141040,8149680," head phase hp halt otherwise uh we are going to the next one"
8149680,8158240," that's cool let's see so how should should just stay in place and don't do anything"
8158240,8161920," all right"
8165920,8172880," okay no buffer overflow no buffer overflow that's pretty cool okay so now uh what we have to do we"
8172880,8180960," have to do the same thing but for the uh to text all right so let's actually do query replace from to"
8180960,8187840," boom and in here font size is not going to be reverted all right it's going to be the opposite of being"
8187840,8195520," reverted um so yeah so this is the position to be fair maybe i should actually put them in"
8195520,8202240," separate scopes uh right so because we defined kind of the same variables in here uh so it would be"
8202240,8207520," better to actually keep them in the same scopes uh let's go okay"
8207520,8221440," it looks kind of honestly but um because they overlap with each other but i think one of the things we can"
8221440,8231200," do is maybe make them more transparent over over time so get so this is just this thing"
8231200,8238880," all right this is just this thing so this is going to be my own sort of queue uh right so and i can assign"
8238880,8246880," this thing in here and this is going to be like that so then i can take the text color so i'm using the"
8246880,8254960," background colors but one of the things i can do is uh color i think color alpha do i have yeah okay oh"
8254960,8261280," it's probably like that all right so then i can use q in here uh let's go"
8265600,8275840," okay okay so it not only uh shrinks down it also becomes more transparent that's what happens uh so"
8275840,8282320," we can do a similar thing in here too so this is going to be just the queue for the queue"
8282320,8292080," uh like so and we can do color alpha like so this is q looks great yeah it's fine it could have been"
8292080,8298640," better honestly oh that's actually epic that's much better"
8303440,8315520," pretty sexy not gonna line yeah pretty cool uh cool by the way i was always like wondering when do i"
8315520,8322400," stop the rendering when do i stop the rendering now i can just look at the phase of the head and if we"
8322400,8328400," reached the uh the hold that's where i have to start like i don't need the render duration anymore i can"
8328400,8340480," just say okay uh if p had phase equal hp halt halt essentially so we're kind of already writing it"
8340480,8347520," like a turing machine simulator at this point uh but that's fine i guess it's kind of funny um all right"
8347520,8354080," so i wonder for how long is it going to go so all right let's let's just try to render it a render"
8354080,8360240," duration we don't need that stuff anymore so let's go to the compilations um did i really remove that"
8360240,8367680," plug yeah we don't need that stuff anymore so let's actually yeah gotcha gotcha"
8367680,8378720," so uh so this is between that but it's actually such a small thing but i that i don't think i need to"
8378720,8386240," indented um overall it's looks it looks nice overall it looks nice i'm really really happy"
8386240,8392400," with how it turns out honestly super happy so i'm thinking that maybe all of the code that is responsible"
8392400,8401040," for uh rendering and previewing should be outside of the dll maybe dll should only contain the code"
8401040,8405600," concerned with actually rendering but i'm not 100 sure about that like how exactly we're going to pull"
8405600,8412240," better uh for now i'm going to just keep it inside of dll uh right so and we'll see all right let's"
8412240,8423120," render it uh okay so and we're rendering i don't remember how it renders pretty slow honestly uh maybe"
8423120,8428960," that's fine so let's just like wait for a little bit let's wait for a little bit so and while we're"
8428960,8434240," waiting so maybe does anyone have any questions while we're waiting for this entire thing to render"
8434240,8441440," up uh right so let's have any questions about what i'm doing or anything i'm just doing oh we're done"
8441440,8448400," apparently but feel free to ask questions i suppose uh what's your opinion on scene 23 i don't know"
8448400,8453760," anything about it honestly i don't know anything but i didn't check it out and i don't really have any plans"
8453760,8460960," to check it out uh right so don't really have any plans so i think it's fine yeah i can call it now"
8460960,8467360," so it renders at 60 fps right now 30 fps but we can make it at 60 fps it's configurable since you're"
8467360,8476400," rendering one frame at a time from ready and not really actually not really uh so we just render the frames as"
8476400,8484640," we can okay so here's how we're doing that we tell if a fan back that we render at 30 fps then while being"
8484640,8491840," within the fps of raylib we render one frame at specific timestamp and we just send that frame to uh"
8491840,8502240," raylib then we update our timestamp with uh you know one over 30. right so we're simulating the you know the"
8502240,8510720," game the animation at 30 fps while raylib still being at 60 fps the simulation during rendering during"
8510720,8518880," sending frames to ffmpac is independent from actual fps of raylib so that's how it works so the the fps"
8518880,8527600," already becomes irrelevant we're simulating at our own fps um we will check a new language glim is just like"
8528240,8534080," you know beam based language is that what it is and sounds very boring on this thing um"
8534080,8542960," uh there goes only the turn machine animation right after that to make a lib generic i don't know we'll"
8542960,8548720," see we'll see so to make the lib generic you need to have very like a lot of specific cases so you can"
8548720,8553760," generalize them right so i don't think i have too many generic cases so what is om i have no idea what the"
8553760,8561200," fuck is this all right let's take a look at the uh animation okay so that's the actual video"
8561200,8570480," oops"
8574160,8586000," what the fuck is this excuse me"
8586000,8595520," it started pretty great not gonna lie it started okay but what the has happened"
8599120,8604400," what the fuck like it's so bizarre actually it's so bizarre like what like it started okay so this"
8604400,8611520," is fine and then it's just like it went haywire uh so you were passing wrong width and height maybe i"
8611520,8620560," was i don't know if i can know uh so screen width render width it shouldn't matter though but yeah let's"
8620560,8626480," actually see what the fuck is going on that's so bizarre honestly that is so bizarre so we have width and"
8626480,8635600," heights okay okay okay okay okay um so so let me take a look at all of the places where we use all of"
8635600,8645200," that stuff uh that is almost probably doesn't matter but yeah anyway uh okay so okay so with some ah"
8652160,8655040," all right uh so what else do we have in here"
8655040,8668320," if i take a look get screen uh screen width okay get screen height okay so that's the only places where"
8668320,8675440," we call to these things that makes sense that's pretty cool by the way can i just like um no i can't"
8675440,8680480," right i was thinking maybe i can copy paste the progress bar from mutualizer but in this case i don't"
8680480,8685600," really know when animation stops uh right so i don't know up front because it's sort of programmatic"
8685600,8692880," like that uh unless i can solve the you know holding problem anyways all right let's go"
8692880,8700640," let's write it this choice let's read it this choice so maybe a more generic question but how do you"
8700640,8706560," determine whether to make a library or to just write the code i if i want to reuse the code and make it a"
8706560,8715600," library uh like what do you mean um or to just try the codes it depends on the situation honestly so is"
8715600,8720480," something lagging are we lagging right now uh i don't really see that we're lagging"
8720480,8726720," so it really depends on the situation you don't have like a generic rule"
8726720,8733280," right so if you look at the situation what do you need do you need a library okay you just make a library"
8733280,8737280," right so we just use the library do you need to write code and you just write a code so there's"
8737280,8745360," no like magical answer to anything um so i don't know i don't know i don't know okay what do we have"
8745360,8767840," and i also looped the the mpv so yeah this is the video and it's working it is working i can now"
8767840,8772960," maybe import it to blender or something like that i can add more different things in here"
8773520,8778320," so uh yes so yes so yes so i think today's stream was actually extremely fucking productive mate"
8778320,8783840," extremely fucking productive all right all right all right all right so let me actually commit whatever"
8783840,8790880," i got um all right so we have these images oh i have sodin zez in here i guess i'm gonna commit it"
8790880,8796640," okay so let's let's actually commit it uh on top of that i think i want to get to ignore the mp4 files"
8796640,8811680," right so this is gonna be mp4 uh and that's it so add support for ffm pack uh and uh make the animation"
8811680,8820240," more programmatic programmatic there we go all right i'm gonna push that all right do i have the"
8820240,8825440," repo yeah i do have the refund but it's private as for now all right i guess that's it for today thanks"
8825440,8830640," everyone who's watching right now i really appreciate that have a good one and i see you all on the next"
8830640,8835840," recreation programming session with mr azuzin i love you all"
