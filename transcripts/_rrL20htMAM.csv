160,6800," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreation programming session with Ahu Amista Azudin."
6800,14560," So we're developing this game, a raycasting game in TypeScript and I started this game as a sort of"
14560,21120," like an exercise in doing raycasting and raycasting is a basically old-school rendering technique"
21120,26880," that it was employed in Doom and just generally old games from 80s and 90s right because they"
26880,33520," couldn't do like a proper 3D so they had to kind of fake 3D and what's interesting is that it kind of"
33520,40160," evolved into full-blown multiplayer game and because of that i need to come up with a good"
40160,47280," name for this game but unfortunately nothing comes to my head yet like i just like can't come up with"
47280,55680," a good name for this game and so what they decided to do is to freaking generate it randomly i think"
55680,62000," this is something i already did some time ago right so the idea that i have is basically"
62000,71200," write like a generator of random words and just pick the ones that uh that i like right so i also have an"
71200,78400," interesting idea of mutating words that i like to produce more interesting words uh right so and i"
78400,84240," decided to make a stream out of that it's not going to be very long stream uh but i don't really plan to"
84240,91920," stream for very long because i recently been sick so i'm kind of like um out of out of the shape uh for"
91920,97280," for streaming so i probably won't be able to stream for very long so i decided to pick a very simple uh a"
97280,104000," very simple topic today so uh it also means that i have a good opportunity to program in c3 right so"
104000,112080," c3 is this uh you know sql to c right uh that we discovered some time ago and i actually want you want"
112080,118560," to rewrite this game from javascript actually typescript but i mean it's javascript to c3 right so because it"
118560,125840," allows compilation to web assembly right so into accommodate myself into myself into using c3 i"
125840,132960," i thought let's just go ahead and you know write a random words generator in c3 sounds good sounds"
132960,139280," gucci sounds what a tamaguchi let's go i should probably add c3 to the description uh so let's actually"
139280,143760," put it in here i'm pretty sure i already did something like that in a different language but i"
143760,148480," already forgot how it was called so i don't know so let's actually do that one more time"
148560,158160," uh right so name oh we do have a name generator yeah in python jesus fucking christ okay so here"
158160,169200," it is uh i found it and it's it's lame it's fucking lame nah it's it's like it's only generate"
169200,175360," nah we're not going to be using this right so right so fuck that shit fuck this a shy so let's"
175360,182080," actually do main c3 let's go so uh how do you program in c3 right so you program in c3 just like"
182080,190160," in c but better right not c plus plus kind of better but actually better right so let's do uh main uh i"
190160,196960," don't know if you have to emacs why did you intend it like that this is disgusting my friend so i think you"
196960,209280," also have to do something like a import std io io io right so and you just do uh io print f uh hello world"
209280,216480," like so uh and do we have c3 compile a main c3"
216480,223600," all right so we need it as far as i know i can actually run it right away after the compilation"
223600,231120," and it says hello world look at that look at that chat is an ad poggers can your zeke do that i don't"
231120,236400," fucking think so i'm sorry uh so"
236400,245920," um now so the idea of generating i think i'm going to be generating basically a sequence of syllables"
246640,255520," right so and so the word is going to be just like a syllable uh syllable syllable and a single syllable"
255520,266480," can be i suppose of basically like a consonant and vowel right so it's actually called wow and"
266480,272080," consonant right so essentially if you think about a syllable like a consonant and vowel you can generate"
272080,276320," quite quite a lot of different funny words and i think this is exactly what we did in that python script"
276320,282960," but there is way more different kinds of syllables you you have for instance closed syllables"
282960,289200," it's just basically consonant uh vowel and consonant and sometimes a closed syllable may not"
289200,294640," have uh a first consonant in here right so this is basically the kind of consonants you have"
294640,300480," maybe you can introduce like a consonant uh that is just like syllable that is just vowel"
300480,306800," um right so you have a lot of freedom in how exactly you can generate all of that stuff uh yeah"
306800,312800," so this is yes the chat already says that uh where is my boomer boomer doesn't work wait a second"
312800,320080," i'd have a go so or just well exactly exactly exactly uh so grammar for words yeah that's kind of funny"
320080,326720," this is basically bnf for words isn't it i never thought about it actually it's literally bnf words"
328800,333040," so you can say word and then you can do something like this"
333040,343760," brub brub brub brub uh so anyway let's actually go ahead and try to generate that so we need to"
343760,351920," generate all the vowels and all of these uh constants but i don't really remember like okay so let's"
351920,358560," actually just generate a bunch of uh characters right can we just do something like a equal to z plus"
358560,364080," plus plus x and simply just print all of the characters in here so i'm pretty sure we can do"
364080,373760," something like this uh can we do something like this uh it didn't freaking work ah that is funny"
373760,381840," because it is basically buffered so and we didn't flush the buffer that's that's really funny actually"
381840,385120," so what if i what if i do something like this"
385120,397680," uh uh it didn't wait a second it didn't tell me that it didn't provide an argument"
397680,405600," how is that better than c i forgot to provide x in here and i didn't say that"
405600,418880," how are we supposed to compete with zagooners with this language"
418880,428000," i'm i'm like how we're supposed to like i'm i'm really fucking disappointed pr time to be fair"
428640,432320," like how would you even implement that uh right so"
432320,438320," like it probably may require fundamental changes to the semantic"
438320,444320," c can no no no c cannot do that specific c compilers can all right so but c generally that doesn't have"
444320,454240," any mechanism to do that um so yeah jai has a very cool thing uh to to resolve that i think jai use literally"
454240,463920," uses meta program um to basically check this kind of stuff so let me actually find so if you take a"
463920,474160," look at jai uh where are the modules so let's find uh something like print uh i wonder if we can"
474160,479680," quickly find that i should be using rib grab probably how did you"
479680,495200," like freaking excuse me how that matches spring ah okay so print that's fine um so float print uh-huh"
496960,506720," yeah but yeah there we go so it puts a note print like right it puts a note print like so that means"
506720,514320," that the arguments of this print function are going to be checked looking at the format string at compile"
514320,522720," time how does it do that you might ask well in jai you can write a meta program that listens to the"
522720,530560," events of the events of the compiler and uh every time a new function has been compiled you are given"
530560,538080," the ast of that thing and you can look up does it have an associated node print like and if it does have"
538080,544160," it you can write a program that grabs the arguments that are passed to this function like for for each"
544160,550400," function call right and uh then just simply you know checks them at compile time i wonder if this program"
550400,558080," is somewhere here actually uh so we can try to find it so if such program exists it probably checks against"
558080,565840," a string literal print like rg vim grep right so yeah there we go here is the here's the problem"
566560,574320," right so the program that checks printf arguments is literally written in jai and part of the standard"
574320,585680," library of jai can your c3 do that can your zeek do that like people like i'm i've said it multiple times"
585680,593520," i've said it multiple times when jai becomes public it's going to be a nuclear explosion like you guys have no"
593520,601920," idea what kind of language this is you cannot even imagine all of your c++ killers are going to be"
601920,608720," completely destroyed it's an insane language i'm telling you i've never seen anything like that"
608720,612000," i like seriously it's genius"
612000,621760," it's just like a c++ won't be yeah that's true that's a c++ won't be but i mean like it has so many"
621760,628480," fucking cool ideas that people didn't even think about it's so goddamn deep you can keep exploring"
628480,634960," it and exploring it and exploring it it still has a lot of unfinished uh unfinished parts right so that's"
634960,640560," true but the bonus is finished it's it's a fucking insane language like holy you you look at it and"
640560,645760," you're thinking why people didn't come up with that before like it's like when you look at it it's it's"
645760,649680," kind of obvious that this is exactly what you want to have right like this is exactly what you want to"
649680,656320," to have why people didn't come up with that before um c++ curves can only kill each other yeah exactly"
656320,662400," because at the end of the day honestly it's like about adaptation right so if the whole"
662400,667280," uh infrastructure is built around a particular language you can't get rid it"
667280,675280," right so that's why cabal can be infinitely shady you can't get rid of it right so it's just like it can"
675280,682880," allow itself to be in the shading so this is like a java annotation yeah kind of can you check java"
682880,691280," annotations at compound i think you can but you need external tools this is basically all in one single"
691280,695680," executable right all of that is just in one single executable"
695680,711040," so yeah um it's it's a very cool language so if java was public i would probably just use jai for uh for"
711040,718720," for ray casting but unfortunately there is another flow in jai currently it doesn't have even like even bad"
718720,725680," support for web assembly like it doesn't have a web assembly support like at all so uh it's kind of"
725680,730400," difficult to do any web assembly development in this language right but it is what it is and it is and what"
730400,740080," is it isn't uh wasn't half life three announced already i have no idea i have no idea i have no idea i i hope we"
740080,744800," get uh half life three before jai so"
749680,773040," but uh like you need to enable experimental flags in the browsers to run wasm64 don't you or did the"
773040,778720," browsers finally evolve enough so you don't have to do that does anybody know because the last time i checked"
778720,785920," and it was kind of like a one and two oh wasm stable no no no no no like i don't accept this"
785920,794000," rust nightly stuff please no no no no no no is it already like available or or not right so it's just"
794000,799280," like it's it's it works in that i don't care about that like i need a stable on this is exactly what i'm"
799280,803840," talking about only with the flags right right right right so this is yeah so this is exactly what i'm"
803840,807440," talking about what i'm talking about only with the flags and it's been like that a year or two ago"
807440,815040," as well and this is kind of what stops me like i can't ask my users to go to flags of chrome and enable"
815040,823440," something they're gonna look at me and they're gonna look at me and just like what what what what is browser"
823440,837840," sorry um you smelly nerds what flag exactly give me the f**king exe give me the f**king exe you smelly nerves"
840000,843200," excuse me um"
843200,851920," so yeah um maybe um well i mean you can do backpatching of uh wasm64 to wasm32 as i suggested"
851920,856400," right so i even created a tool to do that so that's one of the things i um you can do"
857440,866000," uh so i think it's called uh wasm 64 to 32 what a f**king genius name like i really like like this"
866000,871760," name it's like it's five numbers but it's easy to remember actually it's five numbers that are easy"
871760,880480," to remember like 64 to 32 uh right so and what it does it basically takes wasm64 and replaces all of the"
880480,888720," pointers uh like 64 bit pointers with 32 bit pointers while maintaining its 64 bitness right"
888720,894640," so it basically makes a pretty bold assumption that your 64-bit program is not going to be using more"
894640,901120," than four gigabytes of ram so which is to be fair not really that bold assumption it's a reasonable"
901120,907920," assumption for a web application well i mean if you care about like okay so maybe it is not a reasonable"
907920,912000," assumption for web application but it depends on web applications right so if your web developer who"
912000,920720," is trying to do um you know wasm in jai you probably do care about memory usage so it is a reasonable"
920720,927760," assumption for you right so not not making a claim about all of the web developers right so um"
927760,937760," memory safety is that thing even real i mean memory safety is in what in wasm is actually"
937760,943840," achieved by the virtual machine but i mean you can always do buffer overrun in a memory and maybe"
943840,950320," corrupt some buffer and that will lead to something right so but you can't really replace it with an"
950320,955600," executable code and inject some sort of a payload right but you still can do a little bit about memory"
955600,962080," corruption you can't really corrupt the stack though um right on the data so because the the code and"
962080,969680," data in wasm are located like in separate sort of spaces as far as i know code in wasm is not even"
969680,976800," addressable so you have a sequence of instructions there is no real address to that sequence of instructions"
976800,985920," so the only way you can take a pointer to a function is through a mechanism of tables you basically say okay so"
985920,993600," this is a function this function has an id of one so if you want to pass a pointer to a function somewhere"
993600,999440," you actually pass that id and you then can call that id but you can't have an address in the middle of the"
999440,1005440," body of the function right so the code space and memory space are completely fucking separate"
1005440,1011920," there's two stacks and a usual wasm program oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so when it's generated by clang and"
1011920,1020080," llvm in general it also allocates a little bit of a stack on on the memory so you can actually crop the"
1020080,1028960," stack but it doesn't store the return address so yeah harvard has architecture yeah so it's kind of"
1028960,1035280," it's kind of complicated right so it's kind of complicated wasm kind of developed its own thing but"
1035280,1043520," it was not enough for llvm so they just emulated some of the things in the memory that wasm didn't"
1043520,1051920," provide and it's like okay right so we we ended up with what we ended up which is fair which is fair so"
1051920,1059760," anyway um jay is cool uh i really like jay i'm not sure if it will ever be released so and in the time"
1059760,1067200," being we are stuck with c3 which doesn't really check this kind of arguments uh but yeah anyway so"
1067200,1079760," let's go um so uh okay so we've got some of these things so what we can do so this is the alphabet now i"
1079760,1087840," now i need to extract all of the um you know all of the vowels this is not particularly convenient what"
1087840,1096400," if i just put new lines in here uh what if i just put new lines in here excuse me just a second"
1101680,1110400," yes yes all right um now what if i take this entire stuff"
1110400,1120560," so a is obviously vowel right so a is obviously well we can try to do something like this"
1120560,1125840," so then we can take e e so i"
1128640,1138000," j so j is definitely constant right so it's definitely constant l m n o all right so that's o"
1138000,1141440," uh-huh so"
1141440,1146240," u"
1146240,1150000," uh-huh"
1150000,1155520," and that's it i don't think we have any other"
1156160,1165760," so there's y i know but it's usually considered constant is y vowel of co consonant um is well is"
1165760,1171200," why what i think while y is constant yeah it is considered constant at least in english right so"
1171200,1172720," we're going to be oriented on english"
1172720,1181840," so it's same level okay but i mean it's usually used in uh sort of like a consonant context"
1182560,1193360," uh sort of speak sort of speak so let's go um so in here we have the consonants here they are"
1193360,1200640," i wonder if we can just merge all of these things together right like so then we replace space with"
1200640,1206960," nothing and there we go so we've got some scheisse we've got vowels and we got consonants right so this is"
1206960,1217360," going to be um so walls walls and this is consonants cons uh yeah wow con there we go"
1217360,1228000," so let's go ahead and maybe even print them uh walls walls cons"
1228240,1239760," uh-huh so wow bow not wow bow so as a slave i do not distinguish v and w they don't make any"
1239760,1244000," sense to me so uh thank you so much um"
1244000,1250720," backl1 for a tier one subscription with a message love the streams thank you i love doing making them"
1250720,1256320," too sndx thank you so much for your one with the message sub baby is done cooking 12 months oh actually"
1256320,1264560," nine months well i mean yeah so so overall you've been subscribed for a year but i mean you have a"
1264560,1271280," streak of nine months right so it's pretty cool thank you thank you so much okay so let's actually do a"
1271280,1276720," compile run and what does it say names of const must be all uppercase"
1276720,1288960," all right i'll actually endure all of the suffering in the name of pisinov ziguners okay"
1288960,1292480," well we're gonna continue uh actually"
1292480,1300960," zig vibes that wait wait wait does zig do the same like i don't remember like i i think i tried"
1300960,1307280," zig once when i got paid for doing so uh right so and i don't remember does it force a particular"
1307280,1314720," like naming style on on on the thing so it doesn't force a particular naming style can you zig do that"
1314720,1320480," right it doesn't even force a particular naming style on your program"
1320480,1324880," it doesn't even do that pathetic"
1327920,1340240," uh anyways so um all right so let's actually go and just do that"
1340240,1353120," am i supposed to am i supposed to use like a string type"
1355760,1360240," so type name was expected but a variable of function name i think it's"
1360240,1365920," ah okay"
1365920,1376160," uh so well i mean it all makes okay okay okay let's let's put it this way it all makes sense it all makes"
1376160,1383200," sense the compiler messages could have been a bit more helpful to kind of like you you can actually derive the"
1383200,1388960," intentions of the user so you could have been a little bit more helpful when it comes to this kind of stuff"
1388960,1396960," so i don't know anyways uh anyways so what i need to do i need to generate a bunch of uh like random numbers"
1396960,1405440," right so uh let me actually see where we have a rand function in c3 right so where is the rand function"
1406720,1413280," uh so a fan uh ignore everything else maybe it's at the beginning of the line and rand"
1413280,1421040," do we have uh okay so that's a lot of yeah there we go uh so we've got this kind of thing"
1427920,1435680," so and uh yeah here it is it's a built-in function um all right so"
1435680,1449680," uh-huh let me let me see so it's a std math random okay that's pretty funny and um essentially since it"
1449680,1459920," accepts max right can i just do something like a random random uh rand uh rand bow max can i do"
1459920,1467280," something like that that's a very interesting question so if i run this entire thing okay oh it's not it's"
1467280,1477760," not max uh what's the what's the count uh is it len or is it is it something else require is random is violated"
1479680,1488960," so i don't get it a legal instruction okay uh is random"
1488960,1502880," do you have to do something i i think we had this problem before"
1502880,1506080," uh but i'm not really sure so you have to define"
1506080,1513280," random um signal stream confirm yeah so it feels like it wants something from me"
1513280,1520240," but i do not understand what the it wants for me uh right so what does it want from me"
1520240,1522960," do we have any professional c3 developers in the chat"
1523680,1533840," uh right so what does it want to do to set a seed okay so it violates some in uh okay so we know the"
1533840,1539600," position where it violates that it's it's a rand 46 right so 46"
1539600,1543440," and"
1546320,1556080," then maybe 13 require is random and if we take a look at the implementation of this random it's an"
1556080,1564400," assignable okay so it wants to have a global variable random if i understand correctly that's that's what it"
1564400,1573520," wants it wants a global variable random um that is assignable which is kind of bizarre to me like it's"
1574480,1581520," is that what you want like i can create one sure uh i can create one uh let's put it this way"
1581520,1588320," random null all right and i suppose uh yeah"
1588320,1595440," the uh parameter should be assignable um"
1597440,1604960," maybe i don't know uh next default random um so maybe default random"
1604960,1615200," honestly i i don't freaking know um so is there any maybe it's a bug in c3"
1615200,1619920," that is already maybe fixed somewhere okay can we just search for for this kind of thing"
1619920,1629040," so deep people uh so people didn't even discuss this kind of thing so let me take a look at the latest"
1629040,1636880," stuff so again like a lot of things in c3 they make sense but the compiler is not really doing good"
1636880,1642960," job of like at explaining why they make sense for the user there's a type default random maybe you need"
1642960,1652240," to use that i don't fucking know man um so that is really bizarre how we are supposed to compete with"
1652240,1657360," zeke with this again so how we're supposed to compete with zeke i don't fucking understand"
1658240,1668000," um all right so let me let me see is there something uh all right so is random is random"
1668000,1673280," so is there is random okay assignable"
1673280,1681360," so default random yeah"
1684000,1691120," maybe read the comment at the start of the file why there is no comment at the start of the file"
1691120,1700160," is there a comment at the start of the file in here create random for various peak default random random"
1700160,1710320," for just simple integers man this is so bad this is a really fucking bad way to document how to use"
1710320,1715600," your goddamn fucking module the the compiler just should be more obvious it should just tell you and"
1715600,1725360," explain when you do stupid things oh my god uh it's really fucking bad all right defaulted uh or pick"
1725360,1739680," default random define a default my random okay so all right use some seed or seed entropy"
1740320,1750160," uh dude how we're supposed to you know compete with zgooners with this like seriously this is like"
1750160,1758240," embarrassing this is embarrassing all right so will that work bruh will that work maybe maybe i have to do"
1758240,1768480," something like this um all right so default ran yeah it has to be random like this and uh what does it want from me"
1768480,1771920," um not be found did you spell it right"
1771920,1783920," bro this is so fucking bad bad like dude i've never seen it that bad in any fucking language right it's just"
1783920,1789360," like in any language you can just take random and start fucking using it what the fuck is this"
1790960,1795760," i'm i'm i'm disappointed dude dude i'm fucking disappointed how the fuck do you use that"
1795760,1805920," um it's a random instance i don't fucking know like i want it's okay i i hate that i i really"
1805920,1814720," fucking hate it lipc do you have random from lipc uh yeah fuck that seriously like this is not even funny"
1814720,1823040," like this is not even funny uh import std lipc all right uh so"
1823040,1830640," um yep"
1830640,1836400," okay lipc module is it's not lipc okay"
1838160,1841600," uh-huh all right so vowels one"
1841600,1857680," uh-huh so that has to be c then all right so we now can kind of generate uh random things you see"
1857680,1864640," like this is the reason why c is so fucking popular because you can just take it and start using it and just"
1864640,1869200," it works like it's just like what that like you call rent you get a random number that's it"
1869200,1878560," no freaking default no default uh normal uniform like i mean make all of that optional if i just"
1878560,1884880," want to quickly get a freaking random number it should be like it it should be like this that's it"
1884880,1890800," like if i need to go into the cryptography kind of stuff then i should be able to like do additional"
1890800,1895840," things what the fuck it was that this is embarrassing how we are supposed to compete"
1895840,1901520," with zeke with this kind of i don't even know is it is the random situation in zeke better uh right so"
1901520,1909040," let's actually see like how do you do that in zeke um i'm actually really curious uh zeke how do you"
1909040,1928240," how do i search for for random random where is the search in this godforsaken website dude"
1930160,1935120," this is embarrassing there is no convenient search like in c3 documentation"
1935120,1941600," what is this how you're supposed to compete with c3 with this webs"
1948720,1953440," wait this is so funny to me i don't understand oh there's like a tri-ballistic"
1953440,1960320," ooga-booga ooga-booga z-camp oh origin crap ooga-booga it's just like it's so funny to me it's just like a gun"
1960320,1967360," just a bunch of people who look i don't know"
1970560,1980960," so um random uh i can't i can't find that where is the uh there's some in here maybe i can't find"
1980960,1989040," uh so there's a rand but how do i search like nothing like in here like how do how do you switch"
1989040,1998320," the focus to here uh and like you know um so maybe we can do zig random numbers so"
1998320,2015760," uh zig is the arch linux of programming languages yeah uh zig guide okay"
2018000,2024720," um um and these people are saying that zig is as simple as c but just better right it's just like"
2024720,2031440," the motherfuckers really would say oh it's as simple as c and then just show you this so just"
2031440,2040320," like okay um well i mean it's it's it's better i suppose right i don't know um you can just do that"
2040320,2046880," i suppose uh like yeah you need dictionary i don't know maybe maybe it's just like an optional way to do"
2046880,2053600," that uh maybe you can yeah so you probably want to do something like this right um"
2053600,2059920," okay that's that's roughly what i would expect from a modern c killer"
2059920,2068800," that's roughly this anyways so uh let's actually see but anyway just like in in case of c3 oh like"
2068800,2072240," you know explaining how to use the random module could have been"
2072240,2078000," way better it could have been way better i don't understand um right so we have a bunch of like a"
2078000,2084960," random constants and shit and of course i probably have to switch to c uh right so and yeah so we can"
2084960,2089840," generate just uh well i mean you have to set the random seed"
2089840,2097200," uh so i set a random seed to your mom last night"
2100640,2106800," so can we just do something like lipc maybe uh time is that something we can do"
2106800,2115200," this call expected the parameter time ah ah yeah so we have to put a null in here"
2115200,2124960," uh time t cannot be converted to you int but you may use a cas exactly like could you"
2124960,2128400," fucking explain me how to use a random module like this"
2128400,2135920," like i would really fucking appreciate it like like the compiler can be nice and like helpful like"
2135920,2139120," yes like explain me how to use the goddamn random module like this"
2139120,2147120," i don't know i don't know i don't know did you see three compiler changes get merged yet yeah they got"
2147120,2150560," merged yet but the author is still haven't released them yet because"
2150560,2156240," they are busy with solving some problems with whatever features i don't fucking know"
2156240,2163120," random is broken at the moment okay"
2163120,2170640," still doesn't show how to cast i mean it's a c3 so it's for c developers so you're supposed to know how"
2170640,2178720," to do that uh all right so we can do something like this and there we go we are capable of generating"
2178720,2185760," uh random letters uh right so what we can do now is basically just let's generate a word with"
2185760,2194080," three syllables right silly syllables silly syllables uh and it should be roughly pretty straightforward i"
2194080,2201360," think uh all right so we can just take the consonants uh we are just taking the consonants and just put in"
2201360,2211200," like that and then uh print f the new line then your line okay so let's go uh lizano we came up with the name"
2211200,2223120," lizano what do you guys think is that a good name for a game lizano that sucks we can generate another one"
2223120,2227520," how about another one we wather we wather we wather ooh"
2227520,2232960," lizano okay"
2232960,2236000," uh so we wather"
2236000,2246800," so we can do actually very interesting thing we can generate a bunch of them uh so something like"
2247760,2257280," j 0 j 0 j 10 plus plus j uh all right so and just generate 10 words like in in bulk"
2257280,2261680," give you"
2264240,2274320," uh what a what a beautiful names we got in there uh what a beautiful names we got in there um so"
2283680,2288480," so mijiko oh this is a very good name mijiko"
2288480,2300080," yo what the fuck i really love it so let's actually maybe save it somewhere uh all right so this is going"
2300080,2303520," going to be uh one name mijiko uh"
2303520,2305440," nuxifo"
2305440,2307520," uh"
2307520,2307680," or"
2307680,2308720," you your mom"
2308720,2312240," um so"
2312240,2318800," one thing i want to do in here uh let's maybe actually extract that to sort of like a syllable"
2318800,2324080," all right so const in seal three right so this is how many syllables we can have"
2324800,2330880," uh but let's actually do the following thing so let's say um you can have like six syllables and"
2330880,2338160," uh use a random number generator to like randomly generate the length for these things"
2338160,2346240," right so uh let's go so uh let's go so it's not really random it's a rand uh right so it's rand"
2346240,2350400," oh some of them can be bukkake"
2350400,2356800," um so how about the name yeah"
2359760,2366400," um"
2366400,2373120," that kind of implies a particular game mechanics obviously um but anyway um i think i'm gonna save"
2373120,2379760," that i'm gonna save bangers uh just for future reference uh so the thing we can do in here is"
2379760,2388320," that maybe we can maybe we can do like plus one but that means now we have to um you know reduce the"
2388320,2393280," size of this thing like by one right so that means that it's going to have at least one"
2393280,2398320," uh right thing in here right a larger lieo"
2398320,2401840," um so yeah"
2401840,2405600," kubeza kaksu"
2405600,2418160," bugaku is goat bugaku uh so yeah so to be fair as already said uh we have actually"
2418160,2425600," different kinds of syllables uh maybe i can factor out and to uh just something like this so it's"
2425600,2430480," going to be 10. um so we have different kinds of syllables and i suppose maybe we can"
2430480,2438720," just randomly pick between them uh maybe that's what we can do um so this is a very huge"
2438720,2447120," expression that i would like to maybe factor out into something how do you do macros chat uh so i remember"
2447120,2457760," uh is random yeah it is a macro so we can do macro um character rend vowel right and what i expect this"
2457760,2466880," thing to do is to just uh do something like this so rend vowel uh yep so we have to put semicolon yeah"
2466880,2472320," yeah yeah we do put semicolon here and here's the gonna be consonant and this is just con"
2472320,2482800," so that enables me to do these kind of things around con look at that right so does that work um does that"
2482800,2489680," actually work all right so that seems to be working that seems to be what at working so since we have"
2489680,2497520," four kinds of different syllables i think what it makes sense to do is to just uh you know take a random"
2497520,2506240," but four and switch keys upon this mother flippers right switch case so if it's k zero um we can just"
2506240,2512640," do like a single vowel right can we do that i think we can do that if it's one uh right so it has to be"
2512640,2524400," something like this it is going to be a random consonant um random while if it's two it's going to be a random"
2524400,2533360," consonant random while random constant and if it's three it's going to be this again uh but with it being"
2533360,2541840," open on the other end right so this is basically what we can do here and now something like this we can"
2541840,2550320," even do pretty cool thing maybe we can factor it out to a separate function like a rand seal right rand"
2550320,2559840," seal uh this one and it's going to print that rand seal uh because it's going to print the rand seal"
2559840,2570080," we're going to call it print rand seal um okay whatever so it's fine um print rand seal look at"
2570080,2576640," that isn't that poggers i think that's pretty freaking poggers so rand cons it didn't out because it's a"
2576640,2586480," rand con uh huh so it's a rand con uh and look at that isn't that a poggers i think that's pretty poggers"
2586480,2592320," um so just a second i need to call"
2592320,2606160," all right knob git what the what the is this it's it's the god speaking"
2606720,2612160," you know how terry davis would use a random number generator to speak with the god"
2612160,2617600," we're speaking with the god right now holy fucking shit"
2617600,2625440," git and knob i sucks"
2627520,2636000," this is a actually pretty good fucking name um okay so let's actually keep it uh in here so i'm"
2636000,2640000," gonna put it as one of them i sucks git knob"
2640000,2648640," i think uh i think the amount of syllables is too big i don't think we need that many syllables what about"
2648640,2655520," just five i think five has to be a maximum mate blue gen zjf isam"
2655520,2664320," nice random number generator i mean random word generator i"
2666000,2679120," like uh all right uh all right so um that's pretty a pogger so let's actually generate a bunch of more words"
2680560,2708560," and magic it generates pretty funny words honestly uh ksaguawudu po zaryf um papa poi bababooi"
2710560,2717440," purple boy i kind of like this one actually uh i kind of like this one so doing bababooi"
2717440,2722000," what we're doing today we're speaking with the gut"
2722000,2732480," i i don't know like i kind of don't like this syllable or related to just a single vowel i think"
2732480,2738080," it's not particularly useful i think it is not particularly useful so let's actually try to maybe"
2738080,2750960," get rid of that uh 0 1 2 and let's actually do 3 in here let's actually do three so uh fever poll uh met that"
2750960,2755440," so something like a megaxor"
2755440,2763120," megaxor that sounds pretty cool that sounds pretty cool all right"
2765360,2769360," all right all right all right um by sepho"
2769360,2773600," uh all right so"
2773600,2777840," one ducks"
2777840,2786400," this is a very cool looking word and also you know what i'm looking for also the word that catches"
2786400,2794720," attention um right so simple words like this are like actually pretty cool um so and also also easy to"
2794720,2801040," remember like ducks to remember like ducks get duck yo this is a very cool name for a game"
2801040,2802480," ducks"
2802480,2807120," so yeah get ducks"
2807120,2812240," um but it has to be related to ducks then which is kind of meh"
2813280,2827280," uh you know there was a joke about um entertainment in the future being randomly generated"
2827280,2835440," we are living in the future this is our stream now we're just randomly generating"
2835440,2841520," non-secure words and laughing at them this is the content you subscribe for"
2841520,2851040," which is like isn't that are you not entertained are you not motherfucking entertained"
2851040,2854320," okay joe"
2857360,2862000," all right so i'm not gonna add dick to to the list honestly i have an idea what if i actually"
2862000,2868400," you know save all of these things into an array all right so let's actually do something like"
2868400,2872480," const string peaks this is basically my peaks"
2872480,2873680," oh my"
2878080,2885120," i didn't want to put em in here i want you to put semicolon uh yeah there we go so let's go can i do"
2885120,2890080," something like that okay so and we're going to be doing something interesting them with them i want to"
2890080,2899520," mutate them you know what i'm talking about so the idea is going to be pick a random letter in the word"
2900400,2907840," and replace it with another random letter but within the same category so essentially if i picked q"
2907840,2916800," it's a consonant replace it with other consonants and generate a bunch more so those we can have a genetic"
2916800,2924880," algorithm right we can have a genetic algorithm where we pick um you know the the best like sort of like"
2924880,2931200," we select a certain like good candidates and we generate more like natural selection exactly"
2931200,2934400," uh so natural selection all the things i think it's actually kind of cool idea"
2934400,2942320," uh so yeah i think i think that's kind of cool so maybe you can make it like an entire website out of"
2942320,2948240," that for generating names and shit right where it can just provide you a bunch of random nonsensical"
2948240,2953280," things you pick the ones that you like and it keeps evolving them until you come up with a particular"
2953280,2961200," name uh there is a lot of websites that helps you to come up with names but they always try to give"
2961200,2969520," like names that make sense or related to something or whatever quite often the name the marketable name"
2969520,2975680," doesn't really have to have any meaning honestly right it doesn't really have it could be just like a"
2975680,2979840," bunch of like a combination of characters like the good example is xkcd"
2981280,2988240," it doesn't have any meaning it's intentionally picked as non-pronounceable uh as a single word"
2988240,2995600," and it's actually very easy to remember you see like you don't need um your meaningful name to market"
2995600,3003440," something right you just need to have a sequence of characters that activates neurons that's it and how"
3003440,3008800," can you pick a sequence of characters that activates neurons you can basically you know use a generic"
3008800,3014800," genetic algorithm seriously you can use the genetic algorithm you just look okay what activates my"
3014800,3020320," neurons okay so this is a kind of funny word okay so i'm going to pick that can i generate more funny"
3020320,3025360," words out of it oh this is another funny word it actually activates my neurons a little bit more"
3025360,3030720," um right and then you can probably arrive at some interesting name i don't know like i'm not claiming"
3030720,3036960," that's a good way to generate things uh so somebody already done them name eugenics okay uh so let's"
3036960,3050560," let's actually take a look at that"
3050560,3050560," so"
3050560,3055520," uh um that's what you get for trolling zozin that's what you get for trolling zozin get him uh so i think um i've raised him for one hour i didn't plan to actually do like a"
3055520,3074160," a full-blown stream honestly um"
3074160,3080400," so i think um i've raised him for one hour i didn't plan to actually do like a"
3080400,3085280," a full-blown stream honestly um"
3085280,3089200," so i think the time has come to make a small break right so and after the small break we're"
3089200,3094800," going to generate a bunch more names and we're going to mutate them and see how they go um so"
3094800,3100800," all right let's actually generate a little bit more a bullshit names how about that isn't that fun let's"
3100800,3108000," continue having fun uh okay so something doesn't work this is basically has to be like this um so"
3108800,3110000," do we have to do we have to yeah"
3110000,3112240," yes"
3112240,3113600," uh"
3113600,3114480," uh"
3114480,3119280," this is a bit"
3119280,3119680," yep"
3119680,3120880," yep"
3120880,3122800," yep"
3122800,3123920," that that's that's"
3123920,3125040," yep"
3125040,3132320," a rule uh this is a pretty cool name i kind of like that uh i really kind of like that uh allow"
3133120,3134000," so now now"
3134000,3139040," okay uh next one"
3139040,3140800," uh"
3140800,3141680," zook"
3141680,3142400," row now"
3142400,3143680," nuzod"
3143680,3145360," zook"
3145360,3145600," go"
3145600,3146160," zof"
3146160,3148480," will up"
3148480,3150240," recue"
3150240,3152640," nothing particularly interesting"
3152640,3154160," nothing activates the neuron"
3155520,3155920," ksa"
3155920,3164640," i poop"
3164640,3167520," uh"
3167520,3170880," so i mean we can we can add that sure"
3170880,3172960," you nope"
3172960,3174080," you noob"
3174080,3176000," all right"
3176000,3178080," so maybe maybe that's a good one"
3179360,3179920," uh"
3179920,3180560," uh"
3180560,3181280," yubwi"
3181280,3181520," nah"
3181520,3182560," that's too complicated"
3182560,3186720," i really like that"
3186720,3186960," poh"
3186960,3190320," uh"
3190320,3191200," amto"

3193840,3195360," sito no kon"
3195360,3197120," toito"
3197120,3202880," because it sounds really very japanese"
3202880,3205680," well for some reason i don't know japanese unfortunately but"
3205680,3206720," uh"
3206720,3207280," toito"
3207280,3208560," toyota"
3208560,3209520," okay"
3209520,3210800," um"
3210800,3212560," all right"
3212560,3217920," so how many of them we have already oh maybe that's a decent amount of the of the words"
3217920,3221680," uh maybe that's a decent amount of the words okay so let's actually"
3222320,3222880," um"
3222880,3227200," you know start working on something else i want to factor this thing out into something because i"
3227200,3234240," don't want to really lose it um so let's do print rand words"
3234240,3240880," right we can probably pass this as an integer i mean"
3240880,3248560," uh so we we can just like completely copy paste this thing in here initializing of the"
3248560,3254160," random number generator is going to be here um and yeah so we got this thing"
3254160,3261760," so it doesn't do anything so what i want to do i want to be able to mutate a certain word"
3262480,3268240," uh how we're going to be doing that so maybe i'm going to create a function print mutated"
3268240,3276080," mutated word is going to accept the word and it's going to just print the mutated version of the word"
3276080,3283680," so can i can i do for each uh word peaks is that how i do that i don't remember i think"
3283680,3288800," it's semicolon in here like this and in here we can even do something like print mutated word"
3289520,3299520," uh word like so okay so is it going to compile um io io print f s word"
3299520,3306800," all right so we get what we have okay so that compiles apparently so it just worked"
3307520,3313520," so you can just like for each very easily okay so that's cool um so what we're going to do in here"
3313520,3321440," i want to pick a random word so first of all i think uh if i'm going to be doing something like"
3321440,3328400," lipsy rand um word len i have to be careful of len not being equal to zero"
3328400,3335360," right this is what i have to be careful about so let's actually say if this is greater than zero only"
3335360,3340640," then we're going to be doing something right so here we're picking a random character out of the"
3340640,3346560," string i hope this is going to work because i don't really know how the string type works in c3 so"
3346560,3352880," we're picking a random character and we need to check whether it's a vowel or consonant how can we even"
3352880,3362480," check that how can we even check that so um we can we can do something like this so essentially uh"
3362480,3373760," is vowel except the character and in here i'm just doing for each um y in vowels um can i just do something"
3373760,3387920," like contains vowel contains x is that is there something as easy as that um so 54 so let's maybe"
3389760,3397920," okay it's not possible to cast character to string so vowel oh"
3397920,3403600," wait a second"
3403600,3412960," strings do have contains but the only for the string so it's searching for a sub strings"
3413680,3421120," um so we have two options in here somehow create a string out of the character or maybe it has uh"
3421120,3428960," contains character does it have something like this um there's no member for a method on"
3429520,3432000," oh string is just"
3432000,3437600," shut up"
3437600,3443040," no"
3443040,3453520," does it work though that's a good question i don't think so um"
3453520,3462320," of course it doesn't work like come on um all right so i want to kind of find where are all of the"
3462320,3472640," string operations uh all right so let's actually do that rg vgrep string dot contains uh like so can we find"
3472640,3480800," that okay so we can actually see all of the operation mother flipping indexes okay so what are the operations"
3481360,3490080," uh"
3490080,3490640," so"
3490640,3491360," so they only use these um you know error handling thing they all use this error handling thing which makes me"
3491360,3507040," so they all use this error handling thing which makes me think how can i uh freaking not do that"
3507040,3514080," uh freaking not do that okay so i can do index off all right so we can do index off and can i just just return it as a boolean"
3514080,3529200," like how the error handling works in c3 so because again let's take a look at it uh so it returns"
3529200,3536320," uh the index but also with the exclamation mark which means that if it didn't find it it's going to be an"
3536320,3541840," error you can propagate errors uh by i think doing something like this but that means you have to"
3541840,3548240," return them and then an error in here so what i'm thinking is that um is there any way to take an"
3548240,3553440," error to type and just take a check whether it's an error or not basically convert it into a boolean"
3553440,3559600," like i'm not familiar how c3 works on that part uh so let's actually take a look at the documentation"
3560160,3566160," so there is a try people say uh it's a phone on terror so i actually believe you right so because you know"
3566160,3575520," um this language much better than me you you you created this language after i'm just joking uh right so"
3575520,3587360," uh let me let me see so there are some examples uh so try um so maybe an error handling"
3588720,3596240," setting the result of the failure okay so maybe so optionals and error handling"
3596240,3598480," if catch"
3598480,3602880," okay so if try"
3602880,3609680," it's possible to add conditions to all right i see so we can try to do something like try"
3609680,3615440," x all right so is it going to work uh let's try to recompile this into anything"
3618080,3631680," in the net so what does it say an expression was expected so it has to be try you are you telling me"
3631680,3645440," has to be a string index of char"
3648080,3667600," okay so you're telling me that try is not an expression that i can just return in here like that"
3667600,3671680," try is not an expression that i can just return in here like that"
3672960,3679200," guys guys how are we supposed to compete with seek"
3679200,3683520," i'll make a bit of english next time okay"
3683520,3693280," i don't need more tea for that"
3695680,3702320," anyways um so i have an idea actually what if we turn it into a macro what if we turn it into a macro"
3702320,3711200," because turning it into a macro is still not gonna work how i want it to work right so i can try to do"
3711200,3717520," something like this but i mean i don't understand why it has to be not expression this just doesn't"
3717520,3721920," doesn't make any sense it's so natural for this thing to be an expression maybe i'm just missing something"
3722720,3727040," um maybe i am just missing something but i mean it's just like would make sense to be an expression"
3727040,3735600," oh and and you can even only put expressions into macros bro bro bro"
3739840,3747040," all right all right all right it's fine it's fine it's fine the language is not finished"
3747040,3753440," we still have a chance to make it better or maybe i'm just not understanding something"
3753440,3763520," um so to be fair i don't know if it's makes sense for me to even have this function in the first place"
3763520,3771360," because what i can do in here is if this entire thing is a vowel all right so"
3771360,3782720," uh we simply uh what do we do in here we generate a new random vowel all right like so"
3782720,3789920," so here we can actually just take an index uh this is going to be int index like so"
3790960,3798000," otherwise uh this is going to be a random consonants all right so this is a random consonant"
3798000,3809440," um so we mutate the word but then it actually does it copy this thing or not does anybody know if it copies"
3810640,3819840," um can you not do uh at okay i saw it in uh in this string okay so let's actually see at"
3819840,3827200," uh if catch is not necessary in order to get underlying fault from an optional instead"
3827200,3836400," the uh macro oh but why do we need do we need try then i don't understand oh it's okay"
3840640,3848160," okay um but i mean we already it's it's kind of bizarre um yeah okay i say so"
3848160,3859360," so actually would like to to have it like that so okay um all right and then here we can do something"
3859360,3870560," like is val x and this is a macro is well x uh yep i think that's what we can do in here so"
3874720,3883040," where exactly uh where exactly did we fail 37 ah i forgot to remove some slop in here uh okay"
3883040,3895200," uh 52 that's totally fine and uh could not be found this is because this thing has to be like this"
3897200,3912800," uh it's a safe language look at that can you see do that i don't fucking think so oh"
3912800,3924720," uh look guys this is a memory safe language oh memory safe in a language um so what if why is this like that"
3926080,3937600," um let me let me see so random vowel random vowel huh i'm actually surprised like what the"
3937600,3951360," fuck is going on why it crashes with this and specifically in rand bow why it is illegal instruction at the bottom"
3952080,3957680," i have no idea i have no idea i think if i just run it like this yeah so yeah it"
3957680,3963600," so it just threw a weird thing"
3963600,3971200," um it just threw a weird thing i honestly wouldn't expect it to fail at the ran con"
3971200,3976320," like i wouldn't expect this thing to fail it here so it means it fails"
3977120,3984400," so that doesn't make any fucking sense that's just like it doesn't make an easy vowel right so"
3984400,3992480," because these things are not particularly modified so so we can actually do something like maybe"
3992480,3999040," bullying can we can we also specify that this thing is a character is that something we can do um"
4000800,4005600," yeah so that that compiles at least right so but it doesn't work it doesn't work"
4012880,4021040," um all by one error con len no no no no no so mod will actually uh return you minus one it's not"
4021040,4026960," going to include con len that's kind of the point all right and i'm not responding to the chats"
4026960,4033920," it's like silly messages um so what's up with that what's up with that"
4036800,4044000," it if any like it shouldn't fail here i don't see a reason for this thing to fail here it shouldn't"
4044000,4050720," fail in the rent cone it shouldn't fail the right like it shouldn't like it's not a thing that should"
4050720,4059200," happen um so i would expect it to fail maybe here right so maybe index is not correct okay i can understand"
4059200,4066240," that but we already called rank on it's really don't remember you're modifying the string literals i'm"
4066240,4074480," modifying uh the other ah i'm modifying this thing which is a okay so that's understandable but at the same"
4074480,4084080," time rand vow no this should not fail i understand that i made a mistake but that means it should fail in a"
4084080,4090960," different place then it should fail at where i'm trying to do an assignment or index it should fail"
4090960,4098160," at this specific place it should not go deeper like it's it's showing me the wrong place of failure"
4098160,4103520," there is an error but it's in a different place that's what i'm talking about that's why i'm confused"
4103520,4108560," not because i like don't see the problem right it's it's showing me bogus place"
4113200,4118640," it's it's a it's a it's absolutely bogus place um it shouldn't show this thing"
4118640,4128160," um all right all right and even well i mean it's like all by one in uh lines but that's totally fine"
4128160,4135600," so how can we do that can i have a copy of the strings and can i have a copy of the strings i'm not"
4135600,4144560," even sure what's the easiest thing to do in here just copy honestly i think i have got an idea"
4144560,4156480," uh we can do something like this so uh less than len uh right plus plus i and what i can do in here is that"
4157200,4164640," if i is equal to the index we mutate the word uh otherwise we're just"
4164640,4170640," printing the current character right so we're simply printing the current character"
4170640,4178320," uh right so it's gonna be i because it's the same or in here we just do io print f"
4179680,4190720," uh c and like this there we go and we don't have to modify this entire stuff right so let's actually"
4190720,4201120," assign it to x char x is not initialized yet and then we're just printing depending can i have actually"
4201120,4214800," it ternary operator ternary operator hater so and in here if it's a vowel rand vowel or rand uh rand"
4214800,4227280," con like this so this is what we can do in here all right um okay so and in here and that's valid so"
4227280,4232720," at the end we probably want to do print f new line so that's how we're going to be mutating the words"
4232720,4237120," uh all right let's go and this is mutated words"
4237120,4255040," we got it we fucking get it we've got dicks congratulations everyone uh thank you everyone for"
4255040,4258720," watching we converged we finally converged"
4258720,4267840," i finally converged okay so um we can see that rule basically generated the same thing"
4267840,4273440," um called it yeah you call it um what i'm thinking is that"
4273440,4283920," we should probably keep generating until the thing is different um can we do that um"
4285040,4298400," i want to probably factor this out to a different like macro or something so macro uh mutate character"
4298400,4307920," and it returns character and this is basically what it is excuse me so mutate character uh what we can do in"
4307920,4323200," here we can do x mutate character um word i while x is equal to word i mutate character just basically keep"
4323200,4329760," mutating this thing i wonder if you can do some interesting shit like"
4329760,4345280," that's why everybody fucking hates c developers this is literally why everybody hates us uh so"
4345680,4358240," anyways uh i personally don't really like it um so maybe we can yeah so let's put it like this uh so js yeah exactly"
4360320,4369360," um so while it is equal we're gonna be just doing like that uh and yeah we're gonna just print that x"
4369360,4378400," print.x print.x print.x i wonder if i can do some some shit like int x"
4380880,4391600," i've got an idea what if i do something like this mutate x so then later i can do some shit like this"
4391600,4401440," so x is originally just a word uh i mean the current character if this is the index that we're supposed"
4401440,4406800," to modify we're trying to mutate the character we keep mutating it until it's slightly until it's different"
4407600,4413200," and then we're printing it so that kind of encompasses the entire algorithm uh yo"
4413200,4420400," sexy code thank you thank you thank you thank you uh it doesn't even work"
4420400,4423440," why did i put it like that"
4423440,4431520," you didn't see anything no i didn't program in rust recently should i nope"
4435920,4441920," uh all right so what do we have in here oh so you do that in zig right so how do you define"
4441920,4450640," wait a second zig like how do you define um types in zig you don't even define them"
4450640,4460160," damn where is it like this is such a silly example like honestly like i look at the website"
4460160,4465120," of zig and it's just like is this how you're trying to sell me language with this example"
4465920,4471600," um so yeah this is because yeah so this is because of the typescript right so this is because of the"
4471600,4476800," type script um all right so this is the word uh this one has to be actually x"
4476800,4482880," all right what do we have in here uh migako rooks"
4486400,4493200," i've got an idea can we just uh you know generate generate a bunch of more words"
4493200,4502400," to be fair i would kind of like to um yeah to mutate the word but actually return a new copy of the"
4502400,4509840," words all right so let's let's give it a try can i do that uh so is there something like uh string buffers"
4510400,4527360," string buffers or something um okay builders uh allocators arena um string to real string iterator"
4527360,4533760," is there any string builders in c3 um so d string"
4535520,4543120," uh okay uh okay so let me let me try to search for the rg vim grab this string it's a dynamic okay"
4543120,4549680," oh all right all right all right so but i suppose it's a struct"
4549680,4557920," it's not a struct uh what is it then how do i um"
4559920,4566080," okay okay so it's this thing it's a distinct type"
4566080,4570080," interesting all right"
4570080,4583120," so a dynamic string strict all right so maybe we can find something interesting uh in here"
4584800,4596080," d string um standard library rep card uh standard library frequently string builder use this string"
4596080,4600880," yeah uh okay so most fundamental modules"
4600880,4612240," this string these nuts has the dynamic string type i want to just see an example just show me an example how"
4612240,4619600," how you're supposed to use this like i don't care about reading the philosophical stuff okay so i suppose"
4619600,4629520," i don't know man just give me an example i don't care i don't care i don't care"
4629520,4639120," annoying annoying annoying bro bro bro bro fucking annoying uh district temp with capacity okay so"
4639120,4642160," maybe we can so this one is interesting um"
4642160,4650320," oh this one is interesting so this is part of the"
4650320,4654720," yeah new format"
4654720,4656320," uh-huh"
4656320,4660480," temp capacity so then you append"
4660480,4666160," yeah this is exactly what i'm talking about just like show me a bunch of examples seriously just"
4666160,4669520," four can show me a bunch of examples mate uh all right"
4669520,4675760," so we return and i suppose"
4675760,4685200," you can copy string as you can see right uh and i suppose yeah"
4685200,4692240," um string copy uh so i want it to be a sort of like a result"
4692800,4699920," uh all right so this is going to be a result and i'm copying um so str"
4699920,4705120," ah you copy it's it's a part of this d string thing"
4705120,4710960," i see uh okay d string"
4713360,4721360," new init uh it's so annoying bruh how are we supposed to use that"
4721360,4727520," let's show me example just like a simple quick example so i can get up to speed i don't care"
4727520,4738880," like um so annoying like okay i want to um um all right so i suppose i will have to"
4740880,4744560," uh okay so let's actually just like allow doing this kind of stuff"
4744560,4758080," okay so you can't really um um could not be found yeah so uh i already renamed the whole thing"
4758080,4767440," so the the thing i want to do in here the thing i want to do essentially i just want to uh io print f"
4768240,4774480," s like this right so and i'm printing the original thing in here right so just printing the original"
4774480,4782800," thing uh like so and then i want to like mutated few times right so i just want to mutate it few"
4782800,4790800," times maybe three times or something all right so man the lack of examples is infuriating"
4790800,4797920," fucking infuriating like you i see that like it has what i need how the do i use that random module"
4797920,4803440," d string how the do you use that that's exactly what i need but that doesn't explain anything it's so"
4803440,4812880," bizarre ah we how we are supposed to compete with zeke with them okay i'm telling you i'm telling you"
4812880,4819520," bro anyway so uh yeah and then i mutated a bunch of times then like maybe several times maybe three maybe"
4819520,4827520," four or something like that uh all right so this is what i want uh so let's try to do that so str copy"
4827520,4836240," uh st st copy so and i wonder if i can just copy this thing can i just make a copy can i just make a copy"
4836240,4842400," uh missing return okay so i can make a copy that is already fucking cool that is already fucking cool"
4843040,4848480," um and uh we can just return all of that oh and since i can just make a copy"
4848480,4858080," chat chat chat chat chat chat chat that means i can just like modify it i suppose right so"
4858080,4869840," um just a second emacs i can grab this thing so this is the world length this is the result i don't need this"
4869840,4875760," string i just don't need this trick so here's the index and uh what we want to do we want to just"
4875760,4885040," mutate the character there a bunch of times uh like so uh so here's the x but if uh x is still the same"
4885040,4891120," choice if it's still the same choice so we keep generating it and then at some point we are assigning"
4891120,4898960," it back and that should be it that should be it so we're copying the word right so hopefully that makes"
4898960,4905520," it modifiable um so it probably allocates it in malloc so we uh actually leak a little bit of memory but"
4905520,4911680," that's totally fine uh just buy more ram just buy more ram it's that fucking simple stop being poor"
4911680,4916800," uh then we're assigning this entire thing and then we just return this entire stuff right so"
4918640,4924560," you know you know you know you know if you are concerned about cleaning up the memory that means"
4924560,4930800," you just don't have money right that means your programming projects are not making any money"
4930800,4941040," right so you know not caring about memory and just letting the memory leak is the sign of a successful developer"
4942000,4946880," right it's a sign of a successful developer that means your projects are making real money"
4946880,4957680," so you can then buy more ram stop being a poor peasant like complete like take the free"
4957680,4965440," function from the standard labor of c and manually remove it that's how successful software developers"
4965440,4971920," trade you don't need it you don't need it you don't need free when you just have money if you don't have"
4971920,4976880," well you're not successful software i'm really sorry to tell you that i'm really sorry to tell you that"
4978160,4988320," you don't need you don't need it you don't need it you don't need it you don't need it you don't need it"
4988320,4997600," holy shit this is genius it's a fun out there non-free code this is a genius fucking concept i love it"
4998720,5004560," non-free code"
5004560,5012480," so um let's actually see if it's going to work um so it it's i uh we can actually do i"
5012480,5020320," uh okay so x what are you telling me int cannot be converted it has to be char"
5027680,5040240," i do not fully understand um so it is not assignable so you can't modify a string or something um"
5040240,5045440," uh instead of return word"
5045440,5052800," no"
5055680,5072960," ah okay okay i didn't see shit you didn't see shit okay mijiko migilo migiko migiko migiko"

5192720,5195760," so the peaks here suck i think"
5195760,5203280," uh the peaks here sucks so let's actually maybe start over and generate a bunch more things"
5203280,5207520," uh so we can do something like uh"
5207520,5213920," print uh mutated peaks uh so we can take this entire stuff and"
5214960,5217840," we are just taking the peaks and reprinting them"
5217840,5222720," so this is two main functions that we have in here print"
5222720,5224880," brand words"
5225920,5228800," right print brand words"
5228800,5232400," uh print brand words"

5251680,5255840," might be potentially like a final uh name right so without any"
5255840,5256640," mutations"
5256640,5256960," right"
5256960,5257680," so"
5257680,5259920," uh"
5259920,5263440," the rest of them are kind of meh so let's actually generate more"
5263440,5267200," uh random words so maybe i'm gonna actually make like 20 of them"
5267200,5270400," uh five symbols all right let's go"
5270400,5275760," uh i kind of want to actually prepend them"
5275760,5282000," with a little bit of a spacing so they stand out in the output"
5283360,5284480," yeah this is what"
5284480,5289280," this is not a bad name i kind of like it"
5289280,5290400," uh"

5658560,5669740," Jukes. What is Jukes? I also kind of like it, right? So it's also short, luxury fashion. So we're not competing with them."
5669740,5682320," Jukes is pretty cool. Neos are neopronouns. Also Neonetsis. I know nothing about it."
5684400,5691960," Jukes. Okay. Luxury fashion."
5691960,5701760," So I'm going to put it into the list of the final things that I would like to have."
5701760,5709640," Mijico. Also pretty cool name. Let's generate a bit more of the things."

5807660,5808980," So let's actually do a poll."
5808980,5811620," Strawberry poll."
5811620,5812740," Is that how it's called?"
5812740,5814260," I forgot the name of this website."
5814260,5815500," I think it was Strawberry poll."
5815500,5817180," Straw poll."
5817180,5819200," Why do you think about strawberry?"
5819200,5819900," I don't fucking know."

5842460,5844200," In the center."
5844200,5845100," All right."
5845100,5846200," Because they kind of look."
5846200,5847860," They're very marketable."
5847860,5849480," They're very marketable."
5849480,5851280," If you know what I'm talking about."
5851280,5854140," So."
5854140,5854620," Eh."

5858980,5859360," Yeah."
5859360,5860360," I think it's a good idea."
5860360,5863200," Unlimited."
5863200,5864720," Require participants."
5864720,5865320," Nah."
5865940,5867860," One watt per IP."
5867860,5868340," I think."
5868340,5868600," Yeah."
5868600,5869580," So block VPN."
5869580,5869960," Nah."
5869960,5871380," I'm not blocking VPN users."
5871380,5873200," Like."

5881720,5882540," I see what's going on."
5882540,5884640," But I mean."
5884640,5885000," Like."
5885000,5886420," How many VPNs are you going to have?"
5886420,5889120," Or maybe there are some VPNs that allow you quickly."
5889120,5890100," Whatever."
5890100,5892240," Maybe I'm going to block VPN users."
5893360,5894560," So."
5894560,5894560," So."
5894560,5895800," Yeah."
5895800,5896440," I don't use VPN."
5896440,5898380," So user capture."
5898380,5899940," Yeah."
5899940,5900280," Whatever."
5900280,5901580," Okay."
5901580,5902540," So let's create a poll."
5902540,5906920," And how do I share?"
5906920,5909100," Yeah."
5909100,5910820," Let's go chat."

5929980,5931060," Hmm."
5934260,5935380," I also kind of like it."
5935380,5936400," It looks cool."
5936400,5936960," It just."
5936960,5937900," It just sounds cool."
5937900,5939320," Right."
5939320,5941140," So."
5941140,5944000," Nose and Jukes."
5944000,5945120," Yeah."
5945120,5946800," All right."
5946800,5950920," You influence the voters."
5950920,5951260," Yeah."
5951260,5951620," Probably."
5951620,5953220," But I also kind of like it."
5953220,5953420," Right."
5953420,5953880," It's just like."
5953880,5954780," I want you to have."
5954780,5956020," It's not really."
5956020,5958700," About fair voting."
5958700,5959980," It's about."
5959980,5961420," More like."
5961420,5963360," Getting the feedback."
5963360,5963980," From the."
5964120,5964780," From the audience."
5964780,5965160," Right."
5965160,5966200," So I'm getting the feedback."
5966200,5966900," From the audience."
5966900,5968920," And this is a very efficient way."
5968920,5969520," To do that."
5969520,5969800," Right."
5969800,5970120," So."
5970120,5971940," Without reading the chat."
5971940,5972400," Because like."
5972400,5973720," It's not particularly."
5973720,5975480," Convenient to just read."
5975480,5976540," Each individual message."
5976540,5977580," So everyone just like."
5977580,5978740," Said their opinion."
5978740,5979220," Okay."
5979220,5980040," So that's basically."
5980040,5980880," A collective opinion."
5980880,5982400," Right."
5982400,5982680," So."
5982680,5984500," And people like Coil."
5984500,5985700," And I also kind of like Coil."
5985700,5986640," So it's actually called Coil."
5986640,5988260," So that's going to be the."
5988260,5989460," The name for the."
5989460,5990880," For the game."
5990880,5992240," So."
5992240,5994080," And I'm officially renaming."
5994080,5995860," The game to Coil."
5995860,5997340," Right."
5997340,5998480," So let's actually name that."
5998480,6001760," Yep."
6001760,6002800," So the game."
6002800,6004240," Is officially called Coil."
6004240,6005780," So it's actually."
6005780,6008100," Pretty short and sweet name."
6008100,6010020," And it's pretty marketable."
6010020,6010460," Right."
6010460,6011420," So yeah."
6011420,6012000," Let's call it Coil."
6012000,6013320," And maybe it will influence."
6013320,6014300," The kind of like."
6014300,6015340," You know."
6015340,6016860," Mechanics that we can have in there."
6017800,6020880," It's actually pretty cool name for a multiplayer game."
6020880,6022000," Right."
6022000,6022920," So Coil."
6022920,6025880," Sorry."
6025880,6026680," Recoil."
6026680,6026960," Yeah."
6026960,6027340," Maybe."
6027340,6031060," And the fact of using K instead of C."
6031060,6031320," Right."
6031320,6032900," So it's like sort of germanizing."
6032900,6035480," Is a very common thing that happens in there."
6035480,6037040," Right."
6037040,6038160," So you know."
6038160,6043040," This technique of generating nonsensical words."
6043040,6046260," And basically breeding them in a like a genetic."
6046260,6051700," Genetic algorithm sort of way."
6051700,6052860," Germanization."
6052860,6053280," I mean."
6053280,6054340," By germanization."
6054340,6054720," I mean."
6054820,6055840," Like you take a word."
6055840,6056920," And where there was C."
6056920,6057660," You put K."
6057660,6058280," Right."
6058280,6059280," Sort of speak."
6059280,6059980," It's just like."
6059980,6061100," Is it not germanization?"
6061100,6061880," Or I don't know."
6061880,6065780," Didn't really want to offend anyone."
6065780,6066860," So I'm sorry."
6066860,6068060," If that offended somebody."
6068060,6071120," I'm really sorry."
6071120,6072000," Didn't mean to."
6072000,6073560," But yeah."
6073560,6076460," But it's a common thing that people do with words."
6076460,6076880," Right."
6076880,6079060," So just replace it to C with K."
6079060,6080800," And it's just like a new completely different."
6080800,6081000," Yeah."
6081000,6082100," Mortal Kombat for instance."
6082100,6082780," That's what I mean."
6082780,6084800," Didn't really mean to offend anyone."
6084820,6085400," If I did."
6085400,6086600," I really apologize for that."
6086600,6089040," So yeah."
6089040,6091060," So what I was talking about."
6091060,6092920," This idea of generating."
6092920,6094240," You know."
6094240,6096000," Nonsensical words."
6096000,6098460," And basically breeding them."
6098460,6100140," Is very cool."
6100140,6102960," Because by picking them."
6102960,6106140," You're putting meaning into them."
6106140,6108420," That's a very interesting thing."
6108420,6111500," You start with something that doesn't make any sense."
6111500,6114400," But you're selecting out of nonsensical things."
6114560,6116000," That make more sense."
6116000,6117740," You breed more of them."
6117740,6120320," They generate a little bit more meaning."
6120320,6123760," And this is how we arrive at something that has meaning."
6123760,6124080," Right."
6124080,6127560," So coil is an actual English word."
6127560,6129780," And the reason why it is an actual English word."
6129780,6131000," Is because we know it."
6131000,6133560," And we selected it out of the noise."
6134900,6138380," This is a very cool technique actually of generating names."
6138380,6139040," I think."
6139040,6146580," If you come up with more robust algorithm and streamline the flow of breeding new words."
6146820,6148600," You can make a service out of that."
6148600,6149420," Like a website."
6149420,6152620," You know what I'm talking about."
6152620,6153640," Isn't it."
6153640,6155460," I think it's such a cool fucking idea."
6155460,6156480," Right."
6156480,6160080," So because there are websites that generate names."
6160080,6161180," But they're asking you."
6161180,6163200," What's your business is about."
6163200,6163740," Right."
6163840,6165040," So what's your favorite word."
6165040,6168160," And they're kind of trying to make a name out of that."
6168160,6170260," But like just generate a random garbage."
6170260,6172960," And just like breed that garbage into something meaningful."
6172960,6174820," So."
6174820,6177220," The horny word breeder."
6177220,6177540," Yeah."
6179300,6182440," So you can even maybe make something cool."
6182440,6186200," Like let an audience breed the words."
6186200,6187020," Right."
6187020,6187380," So the."
6187380,6188020," Well I mean."
6188020,6190240," We know what the audience is going to come up with."
6190240,6190480," Right."
6190480,6190880," Eventually."
6190880,6191320," So."
6191320,6195180," That's a cool idea."
6195180,6198100," You can make like a very cool project out of that."
6198100,6200860," Let the audience breed."
6200860,6202400," Yeah."
6202400,6204260," So."
6204260,6205160," Yeah."
6205160,6206440," We come up with a name for this game."
6206440,6207440," It's going to be called Coil."
6209220,6209700," So."
6209700,6210380," Yeah."
6210380,6211080," This is Coil now."
6211080,6213940," It's 404."
6213940,6215240," But it's a coil."
6215240,6221120," Maybe it's already taken by the way."
6221120,6225220," So."
6225220,6226260," There's some."
6226260,6230660," Why do you want to know my location?"
6230660,6233120," Fuck you."
6233120,6234800," Anyways."
6234800,6235960," Okay."
6235960,6237000," I guess that was fun."
6237000,6238580," Thanks everyone."
6238880,6240040," Who's watching me right now."
6240040,6241560," I really appreciate that."
