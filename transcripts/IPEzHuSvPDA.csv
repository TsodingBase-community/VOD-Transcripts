240,6080," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreation programming session with Mr. Zozin."
6080,12160," Some time ago we developed a very interesting library so which is called olivc or olivets"
12160,18480," depending on how you want to pronounce it and it's a very cool small library which is basically"
18480,27600," a very cross-platform because it doesn't use any specific api it's an api of itself right so"
27600,33920," essentially it's just a bunch of algorithms that allow you to draw different primitives into"
33920,42080," a given array of pixels right you just give it an array of pixels and then it will just draw"
42080,48080," things into that and because of that it's insanely cross-platform obviously it's kind of slow right it"
48080,52880," doesn't use any headway acceleration or anything like that but it's extremely cross-platform because"
52880,59520," you can have array of pixels anywhere right so um and it doesn't even use in some cases standard"
59520,65120," library so because of that uh you can even compile it uh to web assembly right so and we have a bunch"
65120,70000," of demos in here uh right so which demonstrate how the library works as you can see you have gradients"
70000,76080," you have transparency uh right so you can do a little bit of 3d in here so you can stretch textures and"
76080,82880," stuff like that you can even have like z buffers as you can see the uh the polygons are intersecting"
82880,87600," and that is done through z buffering and stuff like that again we're not using any headway acceleration or"
87600,93760," anything like that the library literally just implements um the rendering algorithms that work"
93760,100240," pixel by pixel right and this is how it's done so you can rotate textures you can have textures in 3d"
100240,105680," and you can also have 3d models and stuff like that so it's actually kind of cool it's actually kind of"
105680,112720," cool i'm going to keep uh the link to this entire thing in the description if you are interested uh so"
112720,120960," um i would like to actually add another demo in here another 3d model right so uh on our discord by the"
120960,130640," way right so um there is a pretty funny meme going on uh so people draw these sort of pictures of this"
130640,137920," creature and uh the members of our community actually collecting drawings of this uh penguin which is"
137920,144000," called panger uh right so i don't really know what's up with that or what it represents people just on our"
144000,150880," discord do that uh so and somebody created like a 3d model of this creature right i'm gonna keep"
150880,155920," the link of like to that is dedicated to to this creature in the description as well if you're"
155920,163280," interested right so uh somebody created 3d model and it's an obg file and our uh demo system actually"
163280,171040," supports obg files in fact all of these models are obg files they are from yeah we even have the emote"
171040,176800," for for panger right so we even have an emote for panger this meme is kind of getting out of control"
176800,182720," so it's originally was just like a discord sodding discord meme but it's kind of spilling out of the"
182720,187760," discord right into the wild world so it becomes kind of difficult to contain it already so i don't"
187760,193360," really know what we're gonna be doing about that uh so anyway right so all of these things are obg files"
193360,201840," already so that means it should be relatively easy to uh to actually implement so uh let me take a look at the"
201840,209040," entire thing so i already copy pasted yeah panger obg here's a panger obg so here's the obg file"
209040,215120," so there's some vertices in here as you can see uh right there's a lot of vertices uh there's also some"
215120,222000," faces and stuff like that but the um the cool thing about this model is that it also has textures right so"
222720,229040," um so here's the texture that is sort of like a put on top of the model i suppose all right and"
229040,235040," there are additional files in here specifically there is like mtl file which i suppose is a material"
235040,241440," file and that material file refers to the panger png which is a texture uh right that is put on top of"
241440,245520," this entire thing so i don't really know how exactly we're going to be rendering all that but i want to try"
245520,250960," to do that nonetheless so in the author of this uh model is max kawula i hope i pronounced your name"
250960,258480," correctly uh all right so they created this uh model so i'm gonna put your profile in the description"
258480,267680," uh right author um author of panger obg right anger obg there we go so i always like to credit people"
267680,273840," and max is amazing yeah absolutely amazing the model itself is really cool unfortunately i can't really"
273840,280240," show it right i wonder if you can just like open it with a blender uh right so obviously here's an"
280240,286240," interesting thing if you open mtl file it refers to ray leap panger blend so i suppose it's an original"
286240,292000," file from which it was created but obg is probably expert you think i wonder if you can just open this"
292000,298640," entire thing with blender so let's see uh right i do have blender in here because i use it for editing"
298640,308480," videos and videos and stuff like that uh so i wonder if i can just do that uh so blend the format is not"
308480,315520," supported file uh so argument has no blend file extension and stuff like that so apparently you"
315520,322080," can't just open obg files with blender blinger yeah um so maybe you can export this somehow but"
322080,328080," whatever i can give it a try actually so is there something like expert the problem with blender is that"
328080,335200," it's extremely unintuitive because it's a piece of software that was developed in its own sort of"
335200,343120," enclosed culture right and because of that a lot of conventions are very unconventional right so to"
343120,349120," speak right so and i don't really know it's kind of difficult to learn but it's also very cool at the"
349120,358400," the same time um so yeah okay so there's the expert in here uh can i okay so i can actually export obg files"
358400,365200," so there's a wavefront there is two of them look at that so there is a wavefront obg uh legacy"
367200,377200," and there's just uh wavefront obg not legacy classic isn't it right classic situation you have a legacy"
377200,383200," mode and non-legacy mode whatever the that means uh right so whatever the that means"
383200,391440," imported no no we need to export oh yeah imported i'm sorry yeah so you're right we're not exporting we're"
391440,398400," importing this entire thing so we'll go into the sorting and uh can i sort i think it's already sorted"
398400,410640," by the alphabet olivets olivets uh okay so and this is assets panger obg okay there's two files in here i"
410640,418080," i wonder if i can just open obg because i'm pretty sure mtl will be referring uh would we referred by"
418080,425120," panger obg yeah okay so as you can see it is referred so i suppose i would expect blender to actually"
425120,431920," recognize that and that i think here it is here's the motherfucker it didn't recognize the"
434240,444080," materials and stuff but okay so look at this look at this creature uh it's so fat oh my god i love it"
444080,452720," it's so cute and fat uh look sus yeah it looks a little bit sus yeah i really like him so yeah we"
452720,460160," need to put this uh uh this penguin into into the demos right so this is this is panger your mom's banger"
460160,471680," oh the sorry um anyways the panger your mom's banker uh so let me see how we're gonna be approaching"
471680,481120," this entire thing so this project uses no build and it uses og no build by the way right so not just like"
481120,486560," a new knob system but it's just like actually old og no build maybe i should actually migrate this entire"
486560,493760," thing to uh to know but some point right so but right now i don't really want to do that so first"
493760,500640," of all the first thing you we usually do we actually convert obg files to c files uh let me actually"
500640,512240," um so let me get rid of this kind of stuff so obviously i i'm just in the tab mode uh right for emacs"
512960,519440," uh so how do i do that uh simpc mode indent tabs mode so this is probably what i want to do let me"
519440,525760," restart my emacs just in case mine affront them uh nice tabs thank you so much thank you i worked really"
525760,533440," hard on them um so all of c and i'm gonna go no build uh dot c there we go so now it is not complaining"
533440,539840," so uh let's take a look at this entire thing maybe i'm gonna actually kill the build folder and just"
539840,544640," rebuild everything from scratch just in case there we go so we'll just wait a little bit it's gonna"
544640,551920," rebuild everything hopefully uh and there's a lot of things right so it prepares the assets right so it"
551920,557520," also then bakes them compiles all of the demos and stuff like that so maybe we can run the tests"
560320,570720," legacy legacy legacy indeed so yeah it builds the wasm demos it builds sdl demos and it builds term demos"
570720,577440," so this entire thing works natively with sdl right and it also can work in your terminal this is actually"
577440,583440," kind of insane i forgot that this entire thing does that okay so in some of the previous stream i said that"
583440,590960," i don't really understand why this project became popular i think i just remembered why"
590960,598400," god damn it okay when i said that i don't understand why this thing is popular because it's such a simple"
598400,603840," library i completely forgot that on top of just being simple library it had a shit ton of cool demos that"
603840,608800," i developed for this library i completely forgot about that and this is actually normal for me because i"
608800,615920," i developed developed a lot of different shit so uh yeah i apologize i just remembered why olive c is"
615920,622560," popular and i suppose it's it's deserved right because this is kind of cool it's it's the same code that can"
622560,630720," work uh in a browser right so and then in here we can have demos uh so teapot 3d uh sdl for instance"
630720,637040," there we go so this is the native uh native version of the same teapot in here right so this thing works"
637040,642880," in the browser and this is like a native window in here uh right and now we can even go into the"
642880,649840," terminal all right so and let's actually go somewhere here all right so like this boom uh and i'm gonna"
649840,659280," i can do um demos uh teapot 3d term yeah there we go so we can if i zoom out there we go so here's this"
659280,667120," this thing in the terminal uh using colors and stuff like that sdl is more laggy than wsd i don't know for"
667120,675440," me sdl is actually more uh smooth um right so and it's the same actual code by the way of demos"
675440,684480," right so we're just adapting since we're rendering into um into the array of pixels the library itself"
684480,690240," doesn't care where that array of pixels go right for different kind of versions we just call to the"
690240,695120," same code of the demo that just renders this entire thing and then we take the resulting array of pixels"
695120,702640," and either put it into the html5 canvas or into the sdl2d texture or into the terminal right it's just"
702640,706320," like it doesn't matter where it goes and because of that it's extremely cross-platform because you can"
706320,715360," adapt this array pixel to to anything it's super easy uh right so that's pretty cool i think i think"
715360,724240," that's a pretty a pretty cool so uh if we take a look at how all of that works all right somewhere in"
724240,730640," the folder assets we have a yuta teapot obg so as you can see it has vertices and stuff like that"
731200,739440," and we have a special utility we have a special utility which is called obg2c right obg2c and what"
739440,747280," it does it actually converts obg file to c file right so uh that utility port obg now c file and if"
747280,753200," you take a look at what it contains it actually turned all of these uh you know parameters vertices"
753200,759600," and faces and stuff like that into global arrays that you can include into your c code and now"
759600,765440," that obg file is baked into your executable right so this is basically what it does for the uh for the"
765440,770080," demos and stuff like that so here are the vertices it even tells you how many vertices you have vertices"
770080,776000," count uh right in here we have faces right so in faces are just indices of the vertices they"
776560,783840," basically encode the triangles and stuff like that uh all right so clang has just added embed by the way"
783840,789520," it's not it's not even released yet so they just edit it in the night or something like that we're not"
789520,797440," using like none of this like new stuff anyway so it doesn't really matter for us uh yeah so this is"
797440,804400," probably the first thing that we will do right so we need to take panger uh and convert it to c"
805120,810000," somehow but interestingly interestingly i think there will be a little bit of a problems with that"
810000,818480," so because if we take a look at the uta t pod so there's only v command and f command in here"
818480,826080," uh right i think uta t pod is actually too huge we can take a look at maybe cap low poly uh yeah so as"
826080,834800," you can see here we only have v and f but panger has way more different things it has way more different"
834800,841520," commands and stuff like that so it has v uh then at some point it has vn i suppose it's a normals"
841520,847440," uh right so these are normal so there's it holds it has vt i don't really know what it is maybe it's"
847440,853200," something it's probably something has to do with the texture right it actually does make sense because"
853200,860400," all the values of uh these things are uh within like they're normalized from zero to one so that means"
860400,866320," there are coordinates in a texture and the texture is probably taken from the uh from the material file"
866320,871440," right and i don't really know what all these parameters mean by the way right so um so maybe"
871440,877760," some of them will be ignored the way we parcel of that i think we just fail or at unknown commands"
877760,883280," right so i think we just failed them and this one is actually rather interesting so what the hell is that"
884400,893760," um so f and there is different variants in here i don't remember that kind of stuff yeah so faces"
893760,902160," we're usually just this so faces are a little bit scuffed and panger so i do not fully understand how"
902160,908880," that works so we're gonna have a little bit of fun converting panger to um you know to c file right"
908880,918400," so we'll see how it goes this is probably new format can you import it and export it as legacy obg"
918400,924160," i don't know i would like to first figure out what those things mean at least right before just like"
924160,930320," frantically trying to export import things right so i don't think it's a really efficient way to do things"
930320,936000," sometimes i fall into that uh sort of trap without like understanding things just frantically trying to do"
936000,941360," things but it's better not to fall into that thing and it's better not to fall into that trap at the"
941360,945920," beginning of the development let's just like sit down and try to explore things okay"
945920,957200," okay so uh let's go into the no build uh dot c and uh so here we're building the assets all right so"
957200,962400," let's go ahead and just do cmd right so this is the first thing we're going to be going to obgc"
963200,971840," so uh the input is going to be uh the input is going to be um uh panger obg"
971840,983920," like so panger obg so this is going to be panger uh like this cool so and also need to specify the"
983920,988160," output uh where we're going to be outputting this entire thing obviously we're going to be outputting"
988160,996880," all of that stuff into the assets uh and assets i suppose we can just say uh panger c right so it's"
996880,1002800," obviously going to fail right it is obviously going to fail but i just want to see how exactly it is"
1002800,1008080," going to fail right i'm really really curious all right so let's go ahead and just do that maybe i"
1008080,1016720," can do something like assets uh right and let's go a known kind of entry mtl uh so it actually prints"
1016720,1026240," the lines uh you know there's off by one in how it prints the lines so let me actually go ahead"
1026240,1032720," and modify that so the entire thing is located in tools so uh the tool that actually converts all of"
1032720,1038720," that is our own custom tool by the way it is our own custom tool so here we have a line number right"
1038720,1045760," so this is the line number and it is here so we're starting lines in like from zeros probably one of"
1045760,1051120," the things we want to do we actually want to start from one but i need to double check whether we are"
1051120,1054880," doing something with line numbers especially no we're just printing them we just need line numbers"
1054880,1059200," just to print them so i think i can just do plus one and it's going to report them in correct"
1059200,1065600," places hopefully okay so no one kind of entry mtl uh it's still it didn't reveal that so let's quickly"
1065600,1071440," do that so it's going to be tools so rebuild the tools and assets and there we go so we can go here"
1071440,1078720," it doesn't know about mtl leap panger mtl so what we can do about that uh what we can actually do about"
1078720,1087760," that i think for now i think for now we can simply ignore it all right so i'm going to do something like"
1087760,1101440," this so if uh so if we encounter like mtl thingy uh what is it called all right so mtl leap mtl"
1101440,1108080," we're going to just log a warning but we're not going to do anything about it right so we're going"
1108080,1113120," to just like log a warning uh because it's obviously going to be very important because it contains the"
1113120,1118960," point to the image files and stuff like that but for now i don't think we can like do anything about"
1118960,1128160," it uh all right so what we're going to do in here is just like a warning um like unknown um like let's"
1128160,1139520," put this way um mtl leap is not supported yet right ignoring it right so we're just ignoring it that's what we're"
1139520,1145520," doing so input uh can you see what i'm doing here okay input file path i think i need to put my camera"
1145520,1152560," a little bit lower so you can see a little bit more so this is the line number and i think that's about"
1152560,1157920," it right so yeah and i'm not going to be exiting in here as you can see here i just like return out of"
1157920,1167120," the function right away so i'm going to just like let it go let it go all right so that looks fine so and this"
1167120,1172560," is what we're going to be doing all right so we're going to be just basically uh running the conversion"
1172560,1178960," from obg to c seeing where it fails and just either put a hack in there or implement the thing that we"
1178960,1184000," need to implement so that's basically going to be the strategy uh right so and we're going to keep doing"
1184000,1190720," that until we um you know arrive at a working working solution somehow right it's probably going to be"
1190720,1195920," limited right so we're not going to jump and implement everything at once uh right but we're going to outline"
1195920,1203280," what needs to be implemented right all right so let's rebuild the tools uh so here are the tools"
1203280,1210800," and let's go with the assets okay so as you can see uh mtl is not supported yet ignoring it right so it"
1210800,1216480," just straight up ignoring it oh all right this one is interesting so what the is oh um"
1217440,1225760," so obg format i need to find like obg format specs can i find any specs for obg format because like"
1225760,1234320," i don't really know what is oh so wave front obg files so we have wikipedia article right so this is"
1234320,1241680," what we use in here um i don't see o in here uh but i would like to have some sort of okay so"
1241680,1249120," named object and polygon groups are specified by the following tags object name okay so this is very"
1249120,1254160," interesting so this is some sort of object so materials that describe the visual aspects of the"
1254160,1261360," polygon are stored in external mtl files more than one external mtl file may be referenced from within"
1261360,1268800," object file the mtl file may contains uh named object polygon groups are specified using tags okay so this"
1268800,1277840," one is rather interesting so is there can we find something like uh g so okay so there is not a single"
1277840,1286320," group how many o things we have okay so this is a single o uh right and we're basically within a single o"
1286320,1294160," object file uh very interesting that is actually very interesting so i guess for now uh we're gonna be"
1294160,1300400," ignoring all that right so it's okay to hard code all of these solutions right it's okay to hard code all"
1300400,1315040," this solution uh as we a q kind uh as we um oh right so and we can do something like fprintf std error and we can"
1315040,1327280," basically say as you info uh processing processing object um you know this thing i want to print the name of that"
1327280,1333680," object right because in here we have like an object name as you can see so this is an object name i want to actually"
1333680,1343360," print this entire thing uh all right so this is input file path uh line number and then we need to specify the"
1343360,1350240," name and the question is how do we even parse that name so there are different ways to parse that so as you can see"
1350240,1357600," here here yeah so this is probably what we can do because kind is sort of chipped off of the line right"
1357600,1366480," so we parse the line we chipped off the um you know by a space so now kind is a command right so some"
1366480,1372720," other command or object or whatever uh and line contains the rest of the argument so the most logical"
1372720,1379920," thing you want to do in here is basically trim the line and the line basically contains the name already"
1380240,1387200," right so we can even do something like string view name line right so that's basically the name we"
1387200,1392080," have in here and i can put it in here there we go so let's actually take a look at how it works"
1392080,1396960," so and by the way in here i probably want to say this is an error right we have different levels of"
1396960,1402960," logging already look at that we're developing our own custom login system right so we have errors in full"
1402960,1408640," warnings and stuff like that uh right so you don't need a login library or login framework you just need"
1408640,1414720," a way to print on the standard output come on right don't over complicate shit brother don't over"
1414720,1423440," complicate shit so um only for j yeah exactly exactly exactly so assets and okay so here's the warning so"
1423440,1429920," here's the warning and then uh we have a panger your mom's banger so i forgot to put a new line in here"
1430560,1435280," uh so by the way i see the subs i'm going to acknowledge them a little bit later just a second"
1435280,1440080," don't worry about it guys don't worry about it uh thank you for for all the subs all right so it's"
1440080,1446720," going to be assets there we go uh all right so mtl is not supported yet in importing it processing"
1446720,1455520," object anger there we go so you know what i want to do i want to put some sort of like um um stop gap in"
1455520,1465840," here so to speak uh so essentially if you encounter several objects as you go um we should fail right"
1465840,1472320," because as of right now this object you see think supports only uh one object like it can convert only"
1472320,1478560," one object so if there are several objects within a single file i think it makes sense to maybe you just"
1478560,1484800," stop maybe not actually that's very interesting but i mean for now we can just fail right so it will be"
1484800,1490400," interesting in the future to support more things but uh i prefer to just implement only the things"
1490400,1498960," that uh you know uh that needed to to make the demo work so what we just need to do we just need to"
1498960,1505680," extract some information out of the object file and put it into the c file so we can just display it in a"
1505680,1514080," a nice way right so the full support of obg format is not really a goal of this entire thing and it's"
1514080,1519200," not really we don't even have enough resources to do that right so maybe we could use some sort of a"
1519200,1523920," library but adding library adds a lot of moving parts and stuff like that so i think i've even already"
1523920,1528720," talked about it in in a previous solid stream so i don't i think i'm not going to go into that again"
1529680,1534800," all right so let me take a look at the subs thank you everyone who subscribed oh my god that's so"
1534800,1542960," many um so many subs fat routine there's a monday 85 a sun full uh midiode thank you so much for twitch"
1542960,1548400," prime with the message hello hello hello hello uh nicholas the nylon thank you so much for uh 21 with the"
1548400,1553600," message 11 months supporting the recreation programming session for 11 months more thank you thank you for"
1553600,1559280," supporting the creation program session so there's some sort of emojis thank you people uh spamming banger"
1559280,1565520," that's nice okma t yeah thank you so much for tier one uh rules junior 08 thank you so much for"
1565520,1570080," the trying with the message thank you mr citizen for the awesome content it's odin pog you're welcome"
1570080,1575200," you're welcome and atlas 87 thank you so much for twitch buying thank you thank you thank you all right"
1575200,1583200," very cool very very cool yeah so uh yeah uh we may want to"
1584000,1593120," have some sort of a boolean in here uh one object encountered uh encountered so this is going to be"
1593120,1605520," false and when we encounter this thing one object encountered true all right so and in here if one object"
1605520,1613600," encountered we actually want to throw an error right we want to throw an error uh so we can say something"
1613600,1625520," like um like this uh so let me think uh obg to see but it would be better maybe to actually say a specific"
1625520,1631120," program do we have a program yeah so if i rename this program uh i want to be going there and just"
1631120,1635760," rename it so i can actually put something like something like this in here so input file path"
1635760,1648960," line number and program name right so program name uh support supports supports supports only one object"
1649920,1661920," as of right now uh as of right now so it would be also nice to say where the previous object was"
1661920,1670640," encountered uh all right so one object encountered um so to do that by the way um"
1672320,1680080," mm-hmm we need to keep track of well i mean we already know file path right so because we're handling"
1680080,1689840," that single path um so we need to keep track of the line right so one uh object one object"
1689840,1701280," line mm-hmm one object line which is originally zero right and that means that uh here we just do one"
1701920,1708320," object line line number right for the for the consistency let's actually call it number"
1708320,1713600," right so the reason i want to keep track of that is because i just want to report that"
1713600,1723520," uh that's what i want to do to explain to the user that where is the mistake uh right we already see the error"
1724880,1731440," s z u note uh we already processing"
1731440,1738480," this object right and since we're processing only one file right so we can uh process only one file"
1738480,1743360," we're going to specify the same file input file path but we're going to be using one object"
1743360,1749440," uh right a line number something like this and after that we're going to just do return defer"
1750160,1757040," uh and i suppose error indicated with one uh right i don't really know where we're returning so yeah"
1757040,1762000," we're returning out of the main right so we're returning out of the main so this is basically what"
1762000,1769600," i'm doing here um because like the way we treat all of that it only makes sense if you have a single"
1769600,1774800," object if you start having several objects it stops kind of making sense right so because of that we want"
1774800,1781440," to have some sort of like a um you know warning that tells you that something is wrong so you probably"
1781440,1788160," want to uh go ahead and implement more features for for this utility right um"
1788160,1803520," so thank you so much for more subs um so uh while i i thank you so much for your one hypnotic"
1803520,1809520," too thank you so much for teach prime and uh mr yuzik uh thank you so much for taiwan with the message"
1809520,1816800," people happy people happy indeed i do agree with that i kind of want to test this uh thing uh right so"
1816800,1825760," i'm in the wrong place by the way in the wrong place in the wrong place yeah i learned uh how to subscribe"
1825760,1831360," to twitch yeah yeah so you you just put ai into your name and you suddenly become an ai that that's how it"
1831360,1839360," works uh right that's how it works uh right that's how it works okay so yeah processing object banger"
1839360,1848960," right and in here uh maybe somewhere like down there right i'm gonna do your mom's banger right so this"
1848960,1854720," is how we're gonna we're gonna do that uh and if i try to now compile this into i think right so we're"
1854720,1861600," already processing this object so uh supports this thing supports only one object as of right now we're"
1861600,1867680," already processing this object okay so as you can see right so it just tells you that well you're not"
1867680,1872080," supposed to do that and the object is already this one so maybe in the future we're going to actually"
1872080,1876800," support more objects why not i didn't see any problems with that but as of right now i just don't"
1876800,1882000," want to be dealing with that right i just don't want to be dealing with that okay that's cool so"
1882000,1889840," what is it a vn uh vn vn vn this is very interesting i suppose this is normals right so"
1889840,1902880," uh list of vertex normals in xyz form uh normals might not be unit vectors aha that is understandable so"
1902880,1909600," that means we should have the same amount of normals as the vertices right so let's do the"
1909600,1916480," interesting thing uh let's do the interesting thing let's literally count how many vertex normals"
1916480,1921600," we have and compare it to the amount of vertices we already have uh you know vertices in here so"
1921600,1928000," vertex count and stuff like that oh so we bring kind of quite a few stats in here this is actually"
1928000,1934080," kind of cool so i think we can even see those stats in here yeah when i'm converting like cap"
1934080,1940640," low poly right so here's the input here's the output here's how many vertices we have uh right so this is"
1940640,1946480," like a range of the vertices from the minimum to the maximum and stuff like that so this is how many faces"
1946480,1952640," we have their indices uh and uh yeah so we can do the same thing with the normals right so we can just"
1952640,1960240," as of right now count them and compare that they have the same amount as vertices 3644 vertices look at that"
1960240,1970480," look at that so how quickly does it even process that uh look at that look how quickly we process"
1971040,1978800," three thousand six hundred and forty four vertices and six thousand three hundred and twenty faces like"
1978800,1985680," it takes us like less than 100 milliseconds like look how freaking fast your computer is"
1985680,1990640," is if you just don't use languages with like huge over bloated runtimes"
1994800,2001680," it's freaking insane honestly it's insane and it's not even like i'm advertising c or anything i'm just"
2001680,2008880," like saying just use by using language without bullshit not even like doing anything special not"
2008880,2014880," doing any optimization right so i'm not a very much uh like a performance person right so i don't know how"
2014880,2020080," to do high performance optimization or anything just like don't do bullshit and you get so much"
2020080,2027680," fucking performance it's freaking insane anybody can be high performance developer in 2024 honestly like"
2027680,2032960," literally anybody even web guys they just need to switch from language to a real programming language"
2032960,2038560," that's it they don't even have to change like how they program just like right in the language that"
2038560,2041440," doesn't have bullshit runtime that's it you're gonna get faster"
2043920,2051520," so it's freaking insane um how it takes how it takes"
2051520,2055440," anyways um"
2055440,2064000," i remember there was some sort of like a meme running around on twitter some some freaking web dev"
2064000,2073600," just accidentally tried uh go and got blown away how quickly it reads files or something they just"
2073600,2078960," couldn't fucking believe right so i don't remember who that was but it's just like it was so fucking"
2078960,2087120," funny it's just like web dev discovered native language like holy that's exactly what i'm talking"
2087120,2090720," about it's just like don't fucking use bullshit languages and you're just like you get so much"
2090720,2097760," performance it it's sometimes even worth it like quite often it even worth it just don't do bullshit"
2099840,2107840," right so you can simply in 2024 there's so much fucking you can make better software but just by"
2107840,2114720," just not doing certain things not just by doing more but simply but not doing things right so"
2114720,2118080," um"
2121360,2126880," imagine world without developers it's not even about the skills okay guys we're at the point where"
2126880,2132080," it's not even about the skills just don't do bullshit it doesn't require any skills just like"
2132080,2137120," use a normal fucking language that's it just just don't use language that add too much"
2137120,2143120," fucking bullshit to the runtime uh it's yeah it's it's more about being aware right so it's just it's"
2143120,2147840," really not about the skill you can keep the skill the same it's just like being aware of what the"
2147840,2152560," fuck is going on on your computer and that's it uh so something interesting from this used"
2152560,2158400," there was a discussion on github where web dev was arguing that cpus are in megahertz and not gigahertz"
2158400,2162160," he was in disbelief that cpus came from billions of vibrations per second"
2162160,2169440," yeah it's like and it's not a really skill issue i feel like people just don't know"
2169440,2175440," people just don't fucking know what the computers are capable of it's just like somebody has to tell them"
2176160,2182400," uh but obviously those people are not listening to to guys like me for some freaking reason maybe just"
2182400,2187840," look look too crazy uh right so but somebody has to tell them right so i don't know"
2187840,2198160," and you have to spread the message like i keep talking about that those don't believe me"
2198160,2202560," right is there something maybe something wrong with the way i talk maybe maybe because of my accent"
2202560,2208720," right so because of my russian accent they think that i'm you know trying to deceive them spreading"
2208720,2217280," disinformation because of my accent everything i say sounds like a disinformation uh so maybe i"
2217280,2226160," should make a small break yeah nah let's actually first uh count the you know normals and compare them"
2226160,2235200," and stuff like that um so let me let me see um deceiving into writing better software exactly exactly exactly"
2235200,2245440," exactly um right so let me let me try um so here okay so here we have vertices faces uh let's introduce"
2245440,2255760," like a normals uh normals uh normals counts it's gonna be zero uh vn we don't really uh support that"
2255760,2270640," okay so we're going to do that and else if sv eq uh kind sv uh vn it was vn right so a normals count"
2271360,2281520," plus one so in here we're going to just print f print f normals and z you uh we're going to just"
2281520,2284960," ignore them right for now we're going to parse them a little bit later but we're going to go"
2284960,2290880," ignore them for now imagine github was written in non-bullshit language and actually worked for once"
2290880,2303120," well i mean it works fine uh 90 of the time um but yeah anyways uh let's try to just freaking build the"
2303120,2312320," tools uh well i'm in the wrong place there we go all right assets there we go so we have uh vt so what"
2312320,2318320," the fuck is vt this is interesting so texture coordinates right i already guessed that correctly"
2318320,2326480," uh already but but how many of them um so texture coordinates this will vary from"
2326480,2335520," okay so i presume this is the texture cranes per vertex right so this is per vertex and it means we're"
2335520,2342320," going to have the same amount of them as the vertices so it's kind of it can even hits that it hints us"
2342320,2347040," that this is the same amount as the vertices because they all start with v this is actually a pretty cool"
2347040,2355600," format i really like that uh right kind of kind of cool format um right so let me go ahead and just add"
2355600,2366720," all of that texture coordinates so size t texture chords count all right so vn"
2369520,2380960," else if if else if sv kind sv kind sv vt texture chords count plus one uh-huh and here we're gonna do just"
2380960,2393760," simply uh texture coordinates but that creates a huge alignment issue um texture chords count so now i have to"
2394320,2401440," to realign the realign the texts so ai people are constantly struggling with aligning ai i struggle with"
2401440,2410640," aligning text we're not the same okay we're not the same anyways uh so this is the tools let's go"
2410640,2423520," let's go assets all right a known kind of entry ass damn didn't expect that to happen so by the way"
2423520,2432080," uh where do we start f yeah so this is where it starts what the fuck is s use mtl panger"
2432080,2439280," matte ah so this is where we start using the material and stuff like that uh-huh all right all right all"
2439280,2442640," right so let's try to find what is s"
2444880,2453200," smooth shading i just clicked okay smooth shading across polygons is enabled by smoothing groups"
2453200,2459120," oh smooth shaders can be disabled as well okay so this is sort of like um"
2459120,2469280," uh it's a basically hierarchical structure right so we can have object you can have groups within object and"
2469280,2476000," you have smooth shading uh groups and stuff like that so this defines a group um"
2476000,2484080," so i guess i'm gonna be ignoring that and what is so one basically means that it's enabled and then you"
2484080,2490960," can disable all of that stuff uh all right so that's that's cool so what that means i'm gonna be ignoring"
2490960,2499120," all of that right so i'm kind of like uh kind of reverse engineering the format right so by trying"
2499120,2506000," to parse it it's kind of similar to how to you you basically reverse engineer binary formats as well"
2506000,2510480," you're just trying things until you encounter something unfamiliar then you look at something"
2510480,2516160," unfamiliar you analyze it maybe implement it maybe put a stopgap run it again encounter something in"
2516160,2522160," familiar and so on and so forth so it's basically like a reverse engineering uh thing um right so which"
2522160,2529280," is kind of fun honestly i really like doing these kind of things uh i think they're super fun um people"
2529280,2534480," who are not enthusiastic about enthusiastic about computers and programming don't like do these kind of"
2534480,2546160," things because it's boring so how do i make money out of them money when"
2546160,2554080," how does it help me to land the job at google what the is all of that nerd"
2554080,2561200," that's an average tech viewer these days by the way not you guys in the chat"
2562080,2566000," since you're here you actually appreciate the recreation programming you're actually"
2566000,2571840," enthusiastic about computer uh computers i believe in you but outside of this small bubble"
2571840,2577840," there is like a ton of these normies who absolutely hate what we're doing right now"
2577840,2582880," but they somehow trying to deceive you into uh thinking that they are really enthusiastic about"
2582880,2590000," all that but deep down in their soul they don't give a right they just want to land the job somewhere at"
2590000,2598720," google and color buttons all day that's what they want right so anyways uh it is what these and it"
2598720,2606080," isn't what it isn't it's kind of sad uh anyways thank you so much and quad the rent for uh twitch"
2606080,2613600," prime thank you thank you thank you uh i'd okay that's a very idfsk uh thank you so much for twitch"
2613600,2621200," prime uh with the message let's fucking go let's fucking go"
2621200,2628720," landing a job at google just to leave it after a few months and start youtube channel so this is why"
2628720,2638560," i left my job uh yeah that i i can imagine people literally doing that right so because why not"
2642320,2650320," because obviously you won't be able to stay very long at uh at google so but with the x googler status"
2650320,2658640," you can make a lot of money on youtube uh all right so it's how it works that's the current trend that's"
2658640,2668000," the current trend so we need some sort of like a way to separate this noise from the signal somehow"
2668000,2674880," unfortunately um all of the filters kind of working against us right so all of the you know filters and"
2674880,2681920," social media and algorithms they still clamping together all of that content with genuine uh"
2681920,2687120," programming content so it's very like we're drowning in all that so we have"
2687120,2693600," to somehow develop mechanisms of uh you know separating all of that so sub mode for instance"
2693600,2699520," right so that we put in here is one of them it's not but it's not sufficient on this one not sufficient"
2699520,2702240," so um"
2702240,2709760," anyways so what i want to do in here is just want to put a warning"
2710800,2722640," so smooth groups are not supported uh right now um ignoring them ignoring can you see that ignoring"
2722640,2731680," uh so input file path and uh this is the line number but we're not going to do anything right so"
2731680,2736880," we're just going to put a warning in here and just move on just simply move on i think the most interesting"
2736880,2744640," part is going to go with f right with the uh faces uh i don't really know how we're going to be even"
2744640,2752480," a person because faces are kind of weird honestly uh they are triples of these things it's just like"
2752480,2762320," what the hell is that i presume that maybe the first things are the indices within vertices and then these"
2762320,2767680," are indices within something else probably within the material right probably within the material"
2767680,2773520," which is this panger matte it's a panger matte material this id does not exist anywhere within"
2773520,2780080," the file right so maybe it does exist within the panger mtl yeah there we go so here is the new material"
2780080,2787200," panger matte and that material these are the parameters of the material i presume right we're not going to be"
2787200,2792400," supporting materials or anything like that right so we're not going to do it at least today maybe we're"
2792400,2797440," going to be doing that later but at least today we're not going to be supporting that yet uh so okay"
2797440,2808960," let's try to rebuild the tools um so i'm going to go in here so tools uh-huh and assets let's go unknown"
2808960,2813760," okay so use mtl another unknown parameter we're probably going to be ignoring that as well"
2814400,2820240," so by explicitly ignoring all of that we also kind of outline the things that we need to implement"
2820240,2826560," all right we also outline all of that so here is the mtl so i'm going to put something like this in here"
2826560,2835040," if maybe i'm going to put space in here usually put space between if and open the current open parent"
2835920,2849680," so can sv use uh mtl material um so use mtl is not supporting yet it's not supported yet ignoring it"
2849680,2851600," all right so"
2851600,2860240," and then i'm going to rebuild the tools let's go assets cool nice"
2861680,2869760," uh this is very cool this is actually very cool uh faces got just parsed just fine"
2869760,2875120," so the amount of normals is actually less than the amount of vertices"
2875120,2880800," which makes me think what the is going on like what the is going on with that"
2880800,2886080," and also the amount of texture coordinates is different than the amount of vertices"
2886960,2899440," i have a hypothesis that those things uh these triples vertex normal texture coordinate"
2899440,2907360," vertex normal texture that's probably what they are i think this is my hypothesis because it kind of does"
2907360,2913920," make sense right it kind of makes sense and the fact uh yeah vertex texture normal but i mean the fact"
2913920,2920080," that it's a triple of these things right so i guess that correctly and also the fact that it just um"
2920080,2927760," you know worked it's kind of sus that probably means that i already kind of handle all of that uh"
2927760,2934080," within the faces so let's actually find the code where i do all this do i do anything special about that"
2934800,2946480," um all right so i convert i basically divide this entire thing oh this one is interesting"
2946480,2954960," yeah i don't do anything about that so essentially i just look at the prefix uh we can even grab the"
2954960,2962400," prefix somewhere here we can even grab this prefix somewhere here uh so that's the prefix i just convert"
2962400,2968240," str to l to l to l and encounter some the first thing that is not that all right so i just do this"
2968240,2976160," uh all right so then i just stream all of that and then i convert to that so i kind of get stuck at"
2976160,2985440," this thing in here at this thing in here so i parse parsed faces absolutely incorrectly"
2986400,2992080," it will be kind of interesting to actually see what is going on with these faces i think it could be"
2992080,2999760," really really interesting but what's funny is that uh this is basically the last thing right so it"
2999760,3005360," basically already does everything we need we needed to do it's just like we probably need to fix the face"
3005360,3011680," parsing um right and it will be fine so let me take a look at how we build"
3012880,3020960," uh obg2c do we add any debugging from it we do in fact add some debug information which is cool"
3020960,3027040," uh let me go into the compilation mode how do we call this thing so this is how we call it right"
3027040,3034080," and i can call it separated like that very cool so here are the parameters i want to open this entire thing"
3034080,3044400," in gf2 um so maybe it makes sense for me to open it like that so i want to open it in gf2 um i want to"
3044400,3053840," open it as asynchronous right so it doesn't block emacs i want to break at the place where we handle the faces"
3054640,3064800," uh well i mean yeah so it's essentially break obg2c at 281 okay so we have any break points"
3064800,3070080," there we go so this is the break point where we're going to be breaking this shit and now i want to"
3070080,3077680," just do the conversion i just want to see how this entire thing is going to be parsing there we go so we"
3077680,3085120," stopped at here let's take a look at the line so we can we can take a look at the locals right so this"
3085120,3090800," is the local variables uh that's a lot of shit we have at the local stuff so i didn't see the line okay"
3090800,3099760," so what is line uh okay currently we're looking at 23 123 right so we're looking at exactly at that"
3099760,3110240," parameter and if we take a look at the panger obg where is the panger obg uh so where is the first ever"
3110240,3118480," app 23 123 so we're looking at here exactly in the debugger uh right in the debugger what is the vertex"
3118480,3128560," it's a mathematical point yes it is okay so in a 3d format um they usually do what they have vertices"
3128560,3135840," which are points in 3d space and it's just an array of points in 3d space and then they have faces"
3135840,3144480," which are basically triangles which are triples of indices triple of indices uh within the vertex array"
3144480,3152560," you get the point so so that that's how it usually works right they have arrays and then they have"
3152560,3158400," basically the objects that refer to certain uh certain vertices or normals or something like that"
3158400,3164000," through the indices so this is basically the kind of format we're talking about uh right so this is"
3164000,3168320," how they do that in 3d graphics if i understand correctly like i'm not the 3d graphics guy but"
3168320,3177920," i have like a surface level of understanding of the synthesis okay so we have so we have a b and c and these"
3177920,3188240," are the indices of the vertices so we might as well just put a b and c right and if i understand correctly a should be 23 b"
3188240,3198160," should be 3 c should be 11 but it's not as it like like that right now right so if i do a became 23"
3198160,3204080," right so then we update the line as you can see it points at hash and we just like update some stuff in"
3204080,3210560," here so then we do trim and it didn't work because stream only works with spaces right it only works with"
3210560,3215200," spaces so this entire thing didn't really work so then we convert b and we end up with zero"
3215200,3223120," right and then we just update this entire thing so we basically stopped at that single hash and we end up"
3223120,3228800," with only parsing the first index and ignoring the rest of them because we just don't know how to handle"
3228800,3235200," all these slashes that's basically what's going on in here um we can even literally see that so that's why"
3235200,3240000," faces are absolutely broken right now and it's pointless to even look at that we can even take a"
3240000,3246480," look at what exactly generated actually it's kind of cool probably uh so panger does see okay so here's"
3246480,3253360," the vertices vertices look more or less correct and faces they even end up minus ones not even zeros by the"
3253360,3262080," way not even zeros but minus ones for some freaking reason oh i know why i know why because this is actually"
3262080,3268480," kind of funny because in object files the indices are one based"
3268480,3275440," don't look at me like that i i didn't invent this for okay i didn't invent it"
3275440,3283200," they're one based but i want to have the format when i converted everything to c i want to just be able"
3283200,3290240," to do things like uh let me show you right so basically um just a second so i have faces i have a"
3290240,3298800," eye face i take zero and then i said okay i want to take a look at the vertex that and then vertex that"
3298800,3307680," and vertex that because so i have two options either subtract one from the indices or maybe add additional"
3307680,3313040," like zero vertex in here so i decided to just subtract one so that's why it ended up like that and it's kind"
3313040,3319680," of cool right so in the sense that it just tells you that it's an invalid vertex some sort of ew yeah"
3319680,3327440," exactly exactly what i i don't know i didn't again i didn't invent that just like i i have to work with"
3327440,3334320," it right so it's a legacy it's a legacy i'm dealing with so it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't"
3334320,3340560," my new friend is it not i think it is so let's actually confirm what the are like between the slashes"
3340560,3346000," right so the first one is the index for the vertices and what's the next one so let's take a look at the"
3346000,3355120," faces all around me are familiar faces"
3358160,3362640," so uh vertex normal indices vertex texture indices"
3362640,3374640," like uh so is it too much flash banging right now guys is it too much flash banging i can do something"
3374640,3387200," like chrome flanks and maybe dark mode enable relaunch because i think it's too much flash banging"
3388160,3397440," for this one so we have a spec in here how huge of a spec this is by the way"
3397440,3404320," maybe i should look at it at some point but i mean so far wikipedia is okay look at it look at this"
3404320,3411200," wikipedia it doesn't even show the the proper icon uh so when it vertex index matches the corresponding uh"
3411200,3416160," vertex elements of a previously defined vertex index index index index is positive then it refers to the"
3416160,3424000," offset okay so vertex texture coordinate optionally texture coordinates indices can be used to specify"
3424000,3429440," texture coordinates blah blah blah blah blah blah blah vertex normal indices okay so that's totally fine"
3429440,3437120," option and normals okay uh yeah okay this is actually kind of easy to implement i think so"
3437120,3445680," after parsing the index all right and doing this thing it is actually super easy it is actually super"
3445680,3454160," easy to then look at line data like zero but you also need to make sure that you didn't hit the end or"
3454160,3463440," anything and just if it's equal to slash okay so that means we're parsing um you know the now the virtual"
3463440,3470080," like the texture coordinates right so and after we parse them uh we can look at it again if it still"
3470080,3475120," contains the the slash so okay it's another thing that we need to parse we need to parse normals"
3475120,3485200," uh so yeah so this is usually something like this and i think i'm gonna just put it to do in here uh like"
3485200,3493120," parse format like this so for now since we're not handling all of that stuff uh we can just ignore them"
3493680,3499120," yeah we can just literally ignore these things texture normals uh the way we already ignore"
3499120,3505440," the things like that start with vt and vn because we're not using them um right so the goal of today"
3505440,3511840," is going to be at least displaying the shape not really coloring it texturing it or anything like that"
3511840,3518800," at least displaying a shape uh then i plan to texture the shape right so um it would be interesting to"
3518800,3526480," texture shape and since we have normals we can probably add some lighting to it right so we can"
3526480,3530800," light it properly right so because we know like how the light should be competing and stuff like that"
3530800,3537760," so yeah that's what i need to do in here sounds like a plan sounds like a pen okay so uh let's make a"
3537760,3544880," a small break and after the break we're gonna uh just do that um okay so let's go ahead and uh just"
3544880,3552240," continue right uh how we're gonna be approaching this entire stuff so as of right now we're gonna be"
3552240,3559760," ignoring the texture and uh the rest of the thing so where is my to do i remember oh oh okay so it's"
3559760,3570000," it's in the wrong place i see i see uh-huh uh-huh uh so here i'm just computing low and high right so i'm"
3570000,3579360," computing the range of the indices uh right so i think i'm gonna put it in here and uh so if um i"
3579360,3584720," encounter all right so if i encounter line uh data"
3584720,3596800," at zero equal to slash i suppose one of the things i want to do i want to get rid of that slash so to get"
3596800,3605520," rid of that slash i need to do plus one and also count minus one because uh line is a string view"
3605520,3613280," right so line is a string view as you can see and string view if i'm not mistaken so we're using sv in"
3613280,3622720," here so do we have sv um so it's a dev dependencies probably sv.h uh string view it's a pair it's a count and"
3622720,3629200," a point uh so i suppose uh remember there was a special function to chop a single character from the"
3629200,3636320," left uh let me see chop uh yeah okay so there's a chop yeah there we go so i can just do it like that"
3636320,3643760," uh and if you take a look at the chop left what it literally does just plus n minus n literally the thing"
3643760,3649040," i do in here it also has a bunch of checks in here uh right it also has a bunch of checks"
3649040,3658240," but that's about it uh all right so i think it's better to use this one like so um so"
3658240,3661280," it's gonna be a line"
3661280,3672480," line just simply one and what's funny is that what if we reach the end of the line i think we have to be a"
3673760,3684240," so line count greater than zero right greater than zero it has this slash we remove that single slash"
3684240,3696240," right and i suppose what we x okay let me put it this way uh i think it would be probably better"
3697600,3709280," to just chop characters while the current thing is not space right so that would be better like while"
3709280,3717200," line count is equal to zero and this thing is space not right is space not"
3717200,3723280," we're gonna be just chopping it off just like chopping it off chopping it off until we encounter the space"
3723280,3730080," we encounter the space we trim this stuff right so we parse the first number and so on and so forth"
3730080,3737440," i think that's a good idea in here generally right and we can actually do that uh like everywhere in"
3737440,3746800," here so we updated the line data right simply updated the line data funnily enough this is a kind of a broken"
3746800,3754000," thing we're doing here because we updated the line data but we didn't update the con like why did i implement"
3754000,3759840," it like that can anybody tell me why the did i implement it like that that's kind of stupid obviously"
3760560,3763200," why didn't i update the count as well"
3763200,3778800," so yeah so on top of just doing that let's stop of just doing that what i have to do is like count"
3780480,3790800," uh but i have to do it like this right so endpoint and pointer minus the data so this is how we move the forward"
3790800,3796880," right so take a look at the implementation of a stereo toll uh it's rather interesting right"
3796880,3803360," it accepts what you need to parse but it also accepts the point at the point to the end point"
3804240,3810480," so essentially if you have a string that just contains some numbers and some other bullshise"
3810480,3816800," and you have a pointer to the beginning of the string and you pass this pointer to the str2 all"
3816800,3823120," what it's going to do it's going to just go and parse the digits until it encounters something that is"
3823120,3832560," unknown right and through the end ptr through the end ptr it is going to return your pointer to that"
3832560,3838080," first character that is not a number anymore and this is how we know how much we need to chop off"
3838080,3845600," from the uh from the string so for some reason what i was doing i was just updating the data of the line"
3845600,3853040," but i wasn't updating the count of the line and that's kind of stupid that is a sign of a dummy dum-dum"
3853040,3859200," absolute sign of a dummy dum-dum but what's funny is that i can kind of figure out how much i need to chop"
3859200,3867200," off right so since this thing kind of i know where i start and i know where i end i can subtract this"
3867200,3875280," thing from this thing and get how much stuff i actually accumulated this um right so i can just take"
3875280,3882320," end ptr minus line data and then i can say okay sv chop left"
3883920,3892400," that from here that would have been more correct in here that would have been more correct in here i"
3892400,3902960," think so uh yeah so in here we parse the index we updated the lows and highs right so then uh we"
3902960,3911120," chopped how much we parsed from this entire thing and then we basically trimmed off everything that is not"
3911120,3916560," space right so the line count is greater than zero and the first thing in here is actually that might"
3916560,3922480," as well just do it like that uh we just keep chopping off one single character that's what we're doing"
3922480,3930160," and we kind of want to do this entire thing for each index in here right for each index in here so in"
3930160,3936880," here we parse the index we parse the index then we just want to repeat that so when we have only three"
3936880,3946880," indices in here uh so it's going to be that and just repeat that and that should be it right so that should"
3946880,3955200," be it so let's go ahead and try to build uh the tools let's try to build the tools uh do they build this"
3955200,3963360," seems to be building so what i want to do uh i want to uh do this thing so this is gf so let's actually"
3963360,3973120," kill it uh-huh and i want to do run uh does it still okay so i still have in the clipboard this run thingy"
3973120,3982160," which is cool i want to do a breakpoint i want to break at obg2c and where we're gonna be doing all of"
3982160,3990800," that so 281 281 break let's take a look at where we exactly braked okay that seems to be correct let's do"
3990800,4003440," the run all right so uh no input was provided really are you for real my friend um i suppose what i have to"
4003440,4017280," do in here yeah one more time okay so we are in here uh if we take a look at the line so what the line is"
4017280,4026800," pointing at the line is pointing at uh 23 123 cool so i'm interested in a b and c uh right so let's go"
4026800,4032080," through the entirety of the thing and see how it parses things okay so we parsed successfully 23 as you can"
4032080,4041440," see so 23 so the next thing uh we updated this kind of stuff so we are about to chop off this 23 from this"
4041440,4048640," line okay so we've got this thing now we have a loop that is going to be iterating and chopping off"
4048640,4057520," uh one character by one until we encounter space oh that actually that actually jumped it probably got"
4057520,4067120," optimized the way do we have any optimizations in uh so when i do obg2c i don't really enable any"
4067120,4074000," optimizations but it just jumped over the entire loop as one single thing which is i don't know"
4074000,4080000," maybe just optimize it uh somehow but whatever but that was fine but it uh cut out whatever we wanted to"
4080000,4088160," cut out okay so b is now three right everything is updated we update the three we cut out the rest of the"
4088160,4095360," stuff okay so then we do 11 and everything's fine so is it even correct from the point of view of"
4095360,4103120," like panger obg in here right so 23 3 11 okay so i think we parse this entire stuff correctly now"
4103120,4109840," right so we parse this entire stuff correctly we remove that and then we just append the faces okay"
4109840,4115120," so that's that's cool so i think we fixed this entire thing i think we'll literally fix this entire"
4115120,4122240," thing so that's pretty cool uh all right so i can do the tools and then i can do the assets"
4123040,4131120," uh all right look at that so this is how many faces we've got thousands of faces for the panger"
4131120,4137600," right so some of the faces faces a bunch of warnings in here as well info warning warning because we have"
4137600,4142800," some things that are not supported in here so we just simply ignore them all right so i'd like to take"
4142800,4154400," a look at the generated panger panger wenger uh so assets panger.c all right so here are the vertices"
4154400,4161520," they make sense it's they kind of like from minus one to one or something so here are the faces all right"
4161520,4170240," so they look fine so they look fine they also look fine very cool as you can see there was 23 3 11 but"
4170240,4178240," they turned into 22 2 10 because uh one base didn't do it okay so that's pretty cool can we turn that"
4178240,4188960," into demo already uh so how do we even build the demos so teapot uh so build assets so this is the teapot"
4188960,4198400," here is the demo uh teapot 3d uh now what if i do panger 3d so that's what we have in here so"
4198400,4204240," this is a panger 3d how do we iterated the names so in the names we just iterate the names and we just"
4204240,4212720," build vc demo right so we just build a single vc demo uh and how we build the wasm demo so we just"
4212720,4222000," provide the name of the demo and the name of the demo corresponds to name of the demo dot c in here"
4222000,4232640," okay so we need to go to the demos and find uh cap 3d so the fun thing in here is that the demos that"
4232640,4240080," are based on 3d models like this they are the same code right so if you take a look at this so"
4240080,4246960," we have two demos in here cup and yuta teapot so here's the cup and there is a teapot in here"
4246960,4253920," literally the same uh right we just include different assets we just include different"
4253920,4262560," assets so and essentially to create the panger 3d c what i have to do i have to include assets panger"
4262560,4272080," uh c right i suppose panger c and i just include the model 3d sort of template uh right so and now"
4272080,4277600," i should be able to build the demos uh right so this is build the demos do we have a panger anywhere"
4277600,4285600," and you see the panger uh it doesn't build shit unfortunately oh okay it builds them in triples"
4285600,4292240," i see so at some point it's going to be building panger uh-huh so it's building teapot so it's soon"
4292240,4297760," gonna build the panger oh look at that it builds it's building panger it's building actually three"
4297760,4306080," versions like wasn't term and sdl so interestingly uh we can already test the native version right so we"
4306080,4314160," we can test the native version so we can go into the demo panger uh sdl that was easy actually"
4316480,4324080," so there we go uh we can probably maybe scale it uh somehow"
4324080,4330080," um yeah that's that's pretty cool so this is a panger"
4330080,4340720," it doesn't support the textures and stuff like that so chat is cool yeah so that's basically 3d model"
4340720,4349120," of uh of this mode right so yeah we have panger in 3d panger the your mom banger so we don't have"
4349120,4354240," textures lighting and and everything like that but we can add support for them a little bit later"
4354240,4362800," um so what i want to do i want to maybe scale it up a little bit so let me let me see uh do i have no"
4363360,4369440," here here it is so when i'm building the assets build the assets you can actually scale things right"
4369440,4378080," as you can see there's a parameter to scale um if i just run build tools obg to see uh yeah scale the"
4378080,4385280," model and i suppose this is just a multiplier uh so that means i can just scale it in like twice uh so i'm"
4385280,4394880," gonna just do no built uh assets let's have let's do assets so we rebuild the assets and now i probably"
4394880,4400720," want to rebuild the demos but i can rebuild specific demos i think i can rebuild panger 3d yeah there we"
4400720,4411440," go so it allows me to rebuild a specific demo uh and i can now try to run that specific demo now it's"
4411440,4418720," actually lagging a little bit so i think twice as big is too much that's for sure i think twice as big"
4418720,4426000," is too much so let's try to maybe uh tune it down a little bit maybe like you know half all right so"
4426000,4431840," let's just scale it in half so we rebuilding the assets and then we're building the demo can i think i"
4431840,4440720," can run the demo after i actually do that so yeah so i probably have to yeah i have to specify the"
4441440,4447760," uh platform i'm rebuilding it for sdl and then i can say okay also run it as well yeah there we go"
4447760,4456000," so the build system is actually super powerful mostly it's actually rather powerful uh so we can"
4456000,4461360," we can do like that so now let me do it like this i'm rebuilding everything we can"
4461360,4465200," even test it in the terminal by the way we can test it in the terminal so demo"
4465840,4476480," um build demos panger 3d term run uh-huh all right so that's actually it's pretty small but i mean it's"
4476480,4482800," it's a readable you can clearly see that it's a panger uh in the terminal uh right you can clearly see all"
4482800,4490480," that damn i actually developed such a powerful infrastructure for okay this okay this library is"
4490480,4495920," cool i completely forgot why it was so cool uh right so because there's this very powerful"
4495920,4500400," infrastructure of things right i can add new things and stuff like that this is so cool"
4500400,4508240," uh so it's okay so it's basically censored it's not safe for work panger you might not like this"
4508240,4514000," but this is big panger problems exactly so let's actually uh run it in the browser uh let's see how"
4514000,4518640," it's gonna look like in the browser so i probably need to update index html and i'm pretty sure in the"
4518640,4524560," the index html it's also pretty step forward right so here is the teapot i'm pretty sure it's just you"
4524560,4536800," know uh putting it like that and so i probably want to get rid of this stuff and simply uh query replace"
4539920,4555040," query replace t pod with panger uh panger yeah i have no idea okay so i'm gonna remove that uh and then"
4555040,4560320," when i'm running the demos all right so i'm gonna be just running it like that so we have an entire"
4560320,4567920," framework for running these things okay so i can try to run it locally so python 3"
4567920,4578400," m http server 69 or 69 um so localhost let's take a look all right so this is what we have at localhost"
4578400,4583360," maybe i'm gonna actually scale it down to 100 and here is the panger running in your browser"
4587280,4592480," so that's pretty cool so here is the panger your mom's banger"
4592480,4599120," it's very cool it's very cool it's very cool it's very cool um so um"
4599120,4608720," so we need to add a description okay so the panger uh the"
4610560,4618320," mascot of uh sodding discord community uh right so"
4618320,4627440," i probably need to give the link to neo cities right so because this is the official website of panger"
4627440,4634320," uh it's it's honestly it's it's getting crazy every time i open it it's getting crazy and crazy and it"
4634320,4640400," it really it's a little bit up by the uh dark mode so i think i'm gonna do just chrome flags and i'm gonna"
4640400,4646960," disable dark mode uh right so super quick and relaunch the the browser browser"
4646960,4655520," bruv it's a browser browser uh all right so this is how it's supposed to look like and it's just kidding"
4655520,4663840," i don't remember it actually throwing that many bagels honestly uh but yeah so there's a lot of"
4663840,4669520," shit in here okay so how we're gonna be uh doing all that so panger"
4669520,4674960," i don't know like i want to give the link um"
4674960,4681600," to that okay let's put it like this so it's gonna be a hrf"
4682560,4697920," uh-huh and a so um the character character design by um so siphon alter do you want me to credit i think i"
4697920,4705200," should credit you i'm pretty sure i should credit you what is your github account what is your github account"
4706160,4716800," um um so yes okay uh it's a phone altera but i don't know how to lane layer okay so lane"
4716800,4725120," layer so that's the famous author of the panger all right so"
4727200,4736880," all right cool so that's you pog u uh so the character designed by the"
4736880,4746880," the model the model by uh so let's take a look at the author so assets"
4747840,4753840," um so there's credits in here oh yeah so i probably need to be a panger obg author"
4753840,4759520," there we go index html"
4759520,4765120," href"
4765120,4772720," ma look i'm a web developer i'm a web developer i'm doing the web"
4773520,4780720," uh so panger the mascot of sodding discord community the character designed by okay so now"
4780720,4789040," uh if i go to here i need to refresh the center i think so panger the uh mascot of sodding discord"
4789040,4795440," community occurred to them by uh line there uh-huh uh-huh it's kind of weird that it actually you know"
4795440,4800320," puts it on the on the next line but i don't really know how to make it keep it in the next line"
4801680,4811760," um so what else did i want to do because there's also source right so we also uh say the source uh and"
4811760,4824480," bsp and bsp so this is that and i'm pretty sure the source is going to be very easy to port just replace"
4825440,4831520," oh huh huh that's really funny nobody actually told me that so it's a teapot"
4831520,4835120," 3d teapot"
4835120,4847520," replace teapot uh panger boom boom all right so panger app 3d"
4850800,4857360," uh panger the mascot of sodding discord community the characters and that and yeah"
4857360,4868080," weirdly okay so everything's fine all right so what i need to do i need to do a committee committee"
4868080,4872320," right so we are committing wasm as well"
4876640,4884960," and here as well so panger also it has a zip but i don't think i'm going to be including zip right so"
4884960,4891280," we only have obg mtl png i'm committing all of that just in case because we're going to add support for"
4891280,4901680," the rest of the things a little bit later uh all right so add panger 3d demo all right and i'm going to push"
4901680,4910720," that right into the repo um okay so we did it we actually freaking did it we added like preliminary"
4910720,4917600," is that how i say that right so it's just like um you know initial panger support right so it's a very"
4917600,4923680," rough one just super quick one super hackish one uh right because the model actually supports way more"
4923680,4930160," different things that we just simply do not support uh one of the things i would like to add next is some"
4930160,4936320," sort of texturing right so we have a texture we know how to map a certain way of faces to certain"
4936320,4942640," textures we know how to even uh do the textures because we do that in here right we literally know"
4942640,4950400," that so we just need to add that capability to our infrastructure to our system uh and i think we"
4950400,4955120," can do that on one of the next streams right so we'll see how it goes i think it's going to be"
4955120,4962240," interesting uh it feels pretty good to get back to uh olivet's development it's kind of a cool"
4962240,4968240," project honestly i don't know why i was why i was hating it some time ago because i thought it's very"
4968240,4972400," simplistic there's nothing particularly interesting but i suppose the interesting part of the project is"
4972400,4978960," not in the library itself it's in the infrastructure it's the friends we made along the way that's what it is"
4978960,4985840," that's what this is the friends we made along the way uh so it's actually kind of cool and yeah so it"
4985840,4991600," definitely needs some sort of textures right because it's kind of like a third boring 3d thing it's like"
4991600,4997120," literally the same demo the third time nothing particularly special uh all right but as soon as"
4997120,5003600," we add textures it's gonna be awesome it's gonna be awesome mate all right thank you so much for all the"
5003600,5012000," subs uh resubs recommitments uh so let me take a look at everyone who uh recommitted uh i guess nobody"
5012000,5019200," recommended okay that's fine that's fine i don't get any money from the subs anyway all right i guess"
5019200,5024000," that's it for today i hope it was fun it was a chill stream nothing particularly special right we didn't do"
5024000,5030400," any slope for engagement we didn't do any slope for the views we just did a like a chill stream for the"
5030400,5037600," oh geez these kind of streams are really important sometimes very important okay that's it for the day"
5037600,5040240," thanks everyone uh love you"
