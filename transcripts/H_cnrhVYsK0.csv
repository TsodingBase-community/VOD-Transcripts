80,6000," Looks like we're live. Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreation programming session"
6000,12000," with Mr. Azuz. Let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start the stream"
12000,21440," as usual. So we're going to do red circle. Okay, can anybody tell me? Okay, I'm trying to search"
21440,29760," for an emode red underscore and there's a lot of emodes that start with red underscore but for some"
29760,37440," reason at the top it is searching chat. I mean I don't complain but who wrote the system for searching"
37440,48160," emotes? Like how is that the most... like I don't understand. It worked fine before. You can watch"
48160,55120," any of my previous streams. It worked fine before. It only recently some intern, some summer intern"
55120,58720," broke this shit and now it's just like... how is that even relevant?"
60080,66000," Anyway, so we only started the stream and we already have to deal with the modern software"
67200,73360," live on Twitch and what are we doing today on twitch.television website? That's a good question."
73360,78640," So today we're doing Raylib on web, right? So I'm going to give the link to where we're doing all of"
78640,85760," that. All right, twitch.tv/toning, https twitch.tv/toning and I'm going to ping everyone who's interested in"
85760,91760," being pinged and there we go. The stream has officially started. The stream has officially started. How's it going, everyone?"
91760,100080," So Raylib is a game library that I use for basically anything related to graphics these days when I work"
100080,108480," with C and not only C because it's a very simplistic library that is actually easy to interrupt with from"
108480,114960," any language. We even did this kind of development from assembly, right? x86-64 assembly, right? So that's"
114960,122880," how simple it is. It is possible to use this library from anywhere. But some aspect of Raylib that I never"
122880,131920," really explored was web support, right? So apparently one of the platforms that it supports is web, right?"
131920,138640," So it has a lot of examples that are also compiled for web, right? So maybe they're using web assembly or"
138640,143200," something like that. I don't really know. I never really tried that and that's the point of today's"
143200,150800," stream. I want to try the web support of Raylib. Here's an interesting thing. For the longest time,"
150800,158000," I kind of thought that to do simple games in C, right? To do simple games in C, you don't really"
158000,166160," need any library support at all because it is really, really simple, right? It is really, really simple."
166160,172720," Some time ago, I developed a simple snake game, right? I developed a simple snake game and I'm going to"
172720,178320," actually show you. I actually streamed this thing, but I couldn't make those streams entertaining enough to"
178320,183600," post them on YouTube. So I really apologize to YouTube people that you probably never see that because"
183600,189040," I kind of sucked at making it interesting to watch. But the game itself, you can find it in here,"
189040,194320," right? So for people on YouTube, I'm going to actually put it in here. So this is basically"
194320,205360," so you can see C wasm, so gene snake C wasm. Right. And the game looks like this. Right. Let me show you."
205360,212560," So this is the game, basically. So it's pretty cool. I really make like an emphasis on smooth animations and"
212560,217680," stuff like that. Right. So it's actually kind of satisfying to play. I really like that. I really like"
217680,222400," how satisfying it is to play this game. So you can try it for yourself. And another satisfying thing I"
222400,227680," actually did is the death animation. Right. So essentially, if you hit yourself, you actually"
227680,232560," shatter into pieces. Right. So it's actually kind of cool. I really like that. And this game is implemented"
232560,239040," in pure C entirely. I think I didn't press enter on my, on my chat. I copy pasted the URL, but they didn't"
239040,245920," press enter. Right. So YouTube people actually received the URL, but Twitch people, they never"
245920,250000," received it because I never pressed enter. So I'm going to go ahead and just press enter. There you go."
250000,254800," Twitch people now have the link to the source code of this entire thing. It's open source. You can do"
254800,261200," whatever you want with it, except stripping off my name from the license. Again, I'm asking nicely."
261200,268080," Do whatever you want, except stripping my name. Anyway. So, and here's the thing. I'm not using any"
268080,274240," special library support. Right. So there is a SDL in here, but this is because I'm cross-compiling"
274240,279440," this entire game between two platforms. We can even take a look maybe at the source code. I'm"
279440,285120," pretty sure I do have a source code in here. So the snake C wasn't blah, blah, blah. So let's actually"
285120,289520," take a look at it. So I have some changes. So fuck that. I'm going to fetch the latest things and I'm"
289520,297440," going to merge them and everything. Right. So merge origin must up. So essentially I have sort of like"
297440,304720," two mains. Right. So I have SDL main, which is written in C, and it also has wasm main. Right."
304720,310960," And the point of these two things is to be two separate entry points to two different platforms,"
310960,317280," to two different platforms. Right. And the game itself is actually platform agnostic. Right. So the game"
317280,325200," itself knows nothing about the platform it's executing in. So what it does, it essentially exposes a couple of"
325200,330800," things that the platform is supposed to call. Things like game you need, game resize when the"
330800,336800," window got resized and stuff like that, game render, game update and game key down. Right. And then it"
336800,341920," expects certain things from the platform. It expects the platform to provide things like fill rect,"
341920,349040," stroke rect, fill text, and so on and so forth. And the entire game is implementing using only,"
350240,359600," I repeat only this API, nothing else, only this API. So and the entirety of the game looks like this. So"
359600,364400," it's almost a thousand lines of code. Right. So essentially that's the entirety of the game. It's"
364400,370240," it's the snake using only this platform API that is implemented differently depending on the platform."
370240,374720," Right. If you compile for SDL, right, for native application, all of these things are going to be"
374720,379040," implemented like so. Right. For instance, platform fill text is going to implement it. It's going to be"
379040,385040," implemented like this. Right. So that's pretty obvious. And if we're talking about web, that's"
385040,390320," literally how all of that is implemented. So we literally have platform fill rect, platform stroke"
390320,396320," rect, and all of that is implemented using HTML canvas. Right. So the game itself doesn't really know"
396320,403440," where exactly it is executing. Right. So the only thing it knows, it actually knows this simple API."
403440,408320," And that doesn't really, again, use any special library or anything like that. We can even check"
408320,413920," that. I can just run SDL main thingy. It doesn't work because, oh, this is actually kind of funny."
413920,421920," I compiled this thing long time ago before I reinstalled my Debian. Right. So, and that executable"
421920,426720," actually comes from those times. So I suppose I need to rebuild this entire thing. I can go ahead"
426720,431440," and try to rebuild this entire thing. And I don't even have Clang anymore. That is very surprising."
431440,436800," I don't have Clang, really? Apparently I don't have Clang. Like that, that's really interesting."
436800,444720," Okay. So let's go ahead and just maybe replace Clang. Oh, this is really funny. I do need Clang"
444720,451200," because only Clang is capable of compiling WASM shit. But to be fair, I don't really need to compile"
451200,458880," WASM right now. Right. So I only need to compile the, you know, the SDL stuff. So here I can quite easily"
458880,464720," do CC and just rebuild this entire thing. And that seems to be working to some extent, but I don't"
464720,472720," really have SDL TTF. Right. So let's actually search for lib sdl2 ttf. Maybe is that underscore"
472720,479520," ttf? I don't quite remember. I think that's what it is. Maybe something like this. Yeah, there we go."
479520,485360," So ttf.dev and what we need to do, we just need to install this entire thing. Unfortunately, I think I"
485360,493040," don't have sudo. Right. So I'm not in sudoers. Yeah, I do remember that. So just a second. I'm going to do"
493040,504000," that quickly on a second screen. It is installing. So let's install sdl2 ttf. And it should be enough,"
504000,512640," hopefully. Right. So let me actually now close in that step. And we should be ready to rebuild everything"
512640,518320," in here. Are you ready? Okay, so we managed to rebuild the entire game. So now if I try to do"
518320,525040," sdl main, so this is how the game looks like, you know, using sdl. And this is the native game. Right."
525040,533920," So you probably saw this game in the browser. And I'm running the same game natively on Linux. And here is"
533920,541280," an interesting thing. That is, without using anything like Electron. Right. I would even say"
541280,549120," this is a different approach to the same problem that Electron is trying to solve. This is really"
549120,557040," freaking cool. Okay. So what Electron does? Right. So it essentially solves the problem of using the same"
557040,562880," code base for your web frontend, for your web frontend, and for a desktop application, for a native"
562880,569440," desktop application. How does it solve that problem? It actually basically packages the web browser with"
569440,575360," your desktop application. That's what it does. And it does, in fact, solve the problem. Right. Here is a"
575360,582560," completely different approach. We have a native application, native application, the logic of which"
582560,589280," is platform independent. The logic of which is platform independent. And we're just compiling that logic"
590400,596960," differently to WebAssembly if we want to run it on web or to native application. And that way we don't"
596960,604960," really ship the browser with our native application because we can effectively implement a small part of"
604960,611280," the browser that we need specifically for our application. A simple native application doesn't need"
611280,617280," the whole browser. So that means we can implement a very simple part of it, which is creating a window,"
617280,623840," creating a canvas, and that's pretty much it. So that is a very interesting... I wonder if you"
623840,632480," can actually develop this approach further and compete with Electron. That is a very cool idea."
632480,639520," That is a very cool idea. And in that case, like, you probably write your frontend in native languages,"
639520,646080," like C and C++ and stuff like that. Right. So, and then using this specific approach, you can just"
646080,651920," like ship a native application that is actually faster than the web one. Like, actually faster than the"
651920,657120," web one. Not just like, you know, work outside of the browser. You know what I mean? That is very"
657120,660960," interesting. So I think I need to think about that approach. Maybe one of the projects that are going to"
660960,667280," have like a serious actual project is going to be like this kind of framework that allows you to create"
667280,672960," these applications that work both in browsers and natively, but all of that without the Electron."
672960,681520," Right. So that's kind of a cool idea. And yeah, again, because of that, because it's really easy to do this"
681520,690160," kind of stuff, I thought that I don't even need RayLib, right, because HTML5 canvas, HTML5 canvas kind of"
690160,698320," already implements everything that you may need from a very simple 2D game. And if you want to go into the 3D,"
698320,707920," it is very easy to create, right, it is very easy to create the, you know, WebGL context, WebGL context."
708560,713760," So, but maybe RayLib actually does something different. And maybe there is a lot of convenient"
713760,719920," things for these kind of applications in RayLib. And that's exactly what I would like to explore today."
719920,728000," Right. So that's exactly what I would like to explore today. So yeah, let me switch my stuff and close this"
728000,738000," window. I compiled RayLib app as an Android app and as x86-64 native Linux app, no platform code needed."
738000,745840," Yeah, exactly. It is actually quite interesting, like how cross-platform can you be by just writing"
745840,753680," simple code to the point that you really don't need a browser to be cross-platform, right? You really"
753680,759120," don't need the browser to be cross-platform, right? You just need to know how to abstract away platform"
759120,764160," API, which is a skill of its own, right? But when you master that, it's just like, yeah,"
764160,768960," you can just abstract away only the things that you need. And that kind of makes it portable."
768960,774800," Because in case of a snake, right, in case of a snake, so if I want to port my game to a different"
774800,781840," platform to Android, I just have to implement six functions, right? That's like literally everything"
781840,787040," I have to do. I just have to implement six functions somehow for that specific platform."
787040,792800," And the rest of the game, the rest almost a thousand of lines, 845, they're going to be the"
792800,799600," same. They're going to be absolutely the same. So that's pretty cool, I think. To be fair, like I think"
799600,805440," cross-platform applications should kind of move towards that direction rather than shipping browser"
805440,810800," with the desktop. It's kind of weird. It's kind of wasteful. And that approach is actually way more"
810800,816800," cross-platform than shipping browser everywhere because this approach will work in places where"
816800,827600," the browser simply does not fit. Right? So, and here's an interesting thing. Ray Leap, like I'm following"
827600,833680," Ray Sun on Twitter and he reposted a lot of interesting things. Apparently people ported Ray Leap to"
834560,845760," Sega Dreamcast, right? Sega Dreamcast, like can you ship like an entirely standard compliant browser on a"
845760,851280," Sega Dreamcast? Like, I mean, well, you can say that it's a dead platform, but I mean, it's just like"
851280,859520," I'm just saying that, you know, it's more applicable approach to more platforms. So yeah, a lot of examples"
860240,868240," in Ray Leap they work on in web, they work on Sega Dreamcast. So that's really cool. That's how cross-platform"
868240,873840," it is. You can run it on Dreamcast, you can run it in a browser. So can you run a browser in a Dreamcast?"
873840,875680," I don't think so. Maybe you can."
879200,887440," You know what would be cool? What kind of cool technology would be? So when you're making an Electron"
887440,893760," app, you strip off part of the browser that your application doesn't need. Is that something that"
893760,900640," Electron is capable of doing, by the way? Does it have some sort of a tool that analyzes your source code in"
900640,908160," JavaScript or whatever identifies which parts of the browser you use and strips off the ones that you"
908160,913520," don't use? Is there something like that for Electron, by the way? Do we have any professional web developers"
913520,924400," in the chat? That sounds like a basic optimization. Would be surprised if it doesn't do that. I have a"
924400,932400," strong suspicion that it doesn't do that. I have a strong suspicion. You know why? I didn't never use"
932400,942080," Discord desktop myself, but I've heard reports from people that say that Discord is like, you know,"
942080,950240," the Electron version of Discord actually has dev tools, but the Discord developers do a lot of tricks"
951040,957200," to actually discourage you from opening dev tools, which means that they can't just disable it."
957200,963280," Right, they for some reason they can't just disable it, so they do a lot of different tricks to"
963280,966800," like detect that you open dev tools and automatically close it and stuff like that,"
966800,974000," so they can't disable it apparently. They need to do all of these hoops to discourage you opening dev tools"
974000,979600," because if they really didn't want you to open dev tools, they would just remove it, but they can't."
980400,987840," So, yeah, that means it probably doesn't do that. It probably doesn't do such a basic optimization."
987840,992000," But in 2024, I suppose nobody cares."
992000,997920," There is a boolean for dev tools. I don't know if that is true. Searching. Okay, so that would be"
997920,1004480," interesting. That would be interesting. Maybe they do want to have dev tools, but I mean if you're shipping"
1004480,1010240," the thing to the user and you don't want the user to use that, I don't know. I don't know."
1010400,1020000," Anyways, who cares about it, Electron? So, let's take a look at the Raylib. Let's take a look at the Raylib."
1020960,1030720," So, how do I even do that? So, I suppose we can go to Raysan and let's go to the releases. So, there are"
1030720,1039520," different releases here for different things and I suppose maybe there is a release for web specifically."
1039520,1044880," Right. So, if you take a look at the downloadable things in here. Right. So, there is a Linux. Okay,"
1044880,1049840," WebAssembly. There you go. So, there is a WebAssembly. So, let's go ahead and just download the WebAssembly thing."
1050880,1059680," So, probe. Do we have Raylib? Okay. So, let's actually create Raylib wasmprobe. Raylib wasmprobe and we're"
1059680,1064560," going to just download this entire thing and let's see how it's going to work. All right."
1069040,1075600," So, what do we have? Okay. So, it probably uses like a Clang thingy, Clang system. So,"
1075600,1082960," is that really WebAssembly? Where is the JavaScript implementation and everything? Okay. So, let's"
1082960,1090320," actually unpack all of these things. It's a little bit bizarre. Like, why is it so small? Right. So,"
1090320,1095680," how exactly does it implement that? So, if we take a look at the file, it's just an archive. Right. So,"
1095680,1101200," it's probably some stuff with the WebAssembly. So, there is including here and let's read."
1101200,1108640," Simple to use WebAssembly. Right. So, WebAssembly. There's nothing much about WebAssembly. Okay."
1108640,1115840," So, maybe what we have to use, we have to use Clang, but I don't have Clang. So, I need to install it. So,"
1115840,1124720," let me search for Clang. So, do I even have Clang on this specific system? Let me search Clang."
1125680,1129440," I'm using ST. And in ST, you cannot actually scroll."
1129440,1137440," So, this simple terminal does not implement scrolling whatsoever. If you want to scroll,"
1137440,1145200," you have to use tmux. Right. So, it is what it is, and it isn't what it isn't. Okay. So,"
1145200,1151520," there is a straight up Clang. But I mean, I already use, you know, tmux. So, it's not a big deal for me."
1152320,1158720," Okay. So, I'm going to quickly install it off screen. So, just a second. All right. Installing."
1158720,1166320," Installing. Okay. Installing Clang."
1166320,1173920," It's interesting how you are supposed to even use this thing."
1176480,1180800," how you are supposed to even use these things. I wonder if I have things like Wobbit."
1180800,1184160," So, do you guys know what is Wobbit?"
1184160,1187120," Wobbit."
1196640,1202960," West Alabama Bank and Trust. Hell yeah. Sweet home Alabama."
1202960,1206560," So, WebAssembly."
1206560,1212240," Yes. So, it's a WebAssembly binary kit."
1212240,1220240," So, and it allows you to actually disassemble like a binary WebAssembly things. So, I don't remember if I"
1220240,1225520," still have that. So, there's things like wasm to see. There's a what to wasm. Wasm to what?"
1225520,1230880," What? Wasm to what? Wasm to what?"
1230880,1237440," Wasm to what?"
1237440,1247200," All right. So, I think Clang is ready. So, let's actually create like a simple, you know, WebAssembly thing."
1248000,1252560," So, and of course, I was talking about Wobbit for a reason. So, do we have wasm?"
1252560,1258160," So, there's a wasm time. Apparently, I do have wasm time. I don't have wasm to what?"
1258160,1265040," But I'm pretty sure I can have Wobbit installed somewhere. So, let's actually search for Wobbit."
1265040,1270160," Okay. So, I do in fact have Wobbit. So, I'm going to go ahead and just install Wobbit as well."
1270160,1272800," So, yeah, of course, let's do Suda."
1275440,1282160," So, and let's install Wobbit. Wobbit, Wobbit, Wobbit. Wobbit, Wobbit."
1282160,1290960," Okay. So, that's pretty cool. So, that allows me to have things like wasm to what? Wasm to what?"
1290960,1295440," That's pretty poggers, I think. That's pretty poggers."
1296960,1305200," So, let's go ahead and just include arraylib.h. And why do you have me? Why do you have this strip?"
1305200,1313520," Okay. So, let's return nothing. And init window. I suppose, like how do you initialize windows"
1313520,1318880," specifically in Raylib? That's a very interesting question. Anyway. So, we're going to have something"
1318880,1327920," like this. And so, hello from WebAssembly. Hello from WebAssembly. And then we're going to close"
1327920,1332080," the window, right? So, we're going to close the window. So, I expect all these functions to be"
1332080,1339760," supported, to be supported on the web version, right? So, because you want to have like a universal code,"
1340880,1345680," you know, that you can just like compile to WebAssembly or something like that. So, and of course,"
1345680,1353440," we're going to do something like while a window should not close, window, yeah, while a window should not"
1353440,1360960," close, we just do begin drawing, right? So, begin drawing, then we end drawing, then we clear background"
1360960,1369360," with red. And that should be it. So, you know what? You know what? So, this is, you know,"
1369360,1377600," WebAssembly stuff. So, maybe it would make sense for me to maybe move this entire thing somewhere here,"
1377600,1386160," right? And have the second WebAssembly. That is for Linux. So, I can kind of compare them, right? So,"
1386160,1390560," I want to have both of them in here. So, first I'm going to compile the native part, and then I'm going"
1390560,1398000," to try to compile the WebAssembly part, just to compare them, right? So, please don't tell me I'm"
1398000,1404560," supposed to use mscripten to compile this. Please don't tell me, because I'm going to be hella disappointed."
1404560,1408880," I'm going to be hella disappointed. But I'm starting to kind of feel like you need to have mscripten"
1408880,1415280," to actually do this kind of thing. And it's just like a little bit disappointing, not gonna lie,"
1416080,1423280," a little bit disappointing. So, you have to sadly instructions here."
1423280,1432960," I'm not looking into that, at least for now. Not looking into that. But maybe I should look into that."
1432960,1448240," Okay, so let's take a look. Working for Web. Do for real? Dude! I demonstrate... I'm so freaking disappointed."
1449840,1455280," I demonstrated a very simple example. This is without any raylib nmscripten."
1455280,1464240," Raysan! You betrayed simplicity! You betrayed simplicity! Straight up!"
1477440,1478480," That's how mad I am!"
1478480,1487440," I actually spilled a little bit of tea on myself. That's how mad I am. Oh my god."
1487440,1497600," Anyways. So, yeah. First of all, what I want to do, let's actually make sure that this thing works on"
1497600,1506560," native. Right. So, let's make sure. I'm going to create a make file. So, let's do it like this. And I'm"
1506560,1514800," going to do clang o main main.c. Right. And let's actually go and try to compile this entirely. So, yeah."
1514800,1521280," It doesn't know where is raylib. So, let's actually tell it where is the raylib. It is located. I mean,"
1521280,1529840," specifically the include folder. Include folder. So, let's actually go here. Okay. So, that seems to be"
1529840,1538560," okey-dokey. And then I do l raylib, raylib, l m. And that should be about it. So, then it will complain that"
1538560,1548080," it can't find any of these things. Which is fine. I can forgive that. Unlike betraying simplicity."
1549440,1564960," And buying into that mscript. And anyways. So, okay. So, really. You used the so version of this thing."
1564960,1571360," Right. You literally use the so version even though there was... Is there any way for me to tell you,"
1571360,1579200," bruh, use raylib.a. So, I don't remember how you say that. I think you"
1579200,1588960," have to say something like lib or what not. Does anybody remember how to tell the compiler"
1588960,1592960," just bruh, use the... Yeah, I think that's how you do that."
1592960,1600320," Yo, I remember how to do that. Holy shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, essentially what it did,"
1600320,1608560," this mscript the so version of the library. It picked the so version, but they explicitly said use the static one."
1608560,1615360," So, it actually did that. So, that's pretty cool. So, it's kind of like a random piece of knowledge"
1615360,1619680," that I kind of like have in my language model in the brain. Right. So, all of a sudden, just like"
1620400,1627920," a period out of nowhere. So, that thing seems to be working. So, maybe we're gonna have something like"
1627920,1631680," native. Let's actually call it native. Though, the highlighting"
1632240,1639440," fucked up everything. So, maybe you can do something like this. Or maybe even, you know what? You know what?"
1639440,1647120," Nah, you have to include this thing. Emacs didn't expect that you can have colons in the command line"
1647120,1654000," arguments. Emacs just didn't expect that shit to happen at all. So, yeah, that's pretty interesting."
1654720,1662800," Anyways, so, let me try to do this kind of thing. Let me try to do this kind of thing. And there we go."
1662800,1671520," We have a native thing. And I suppose if I want to have a main web, right? So, main web. I'm gonna have"
1671520,1681600," something like this. And that is not going to be enough. Right. So, obviously, here we will have to"
1681600,1698720," redirect to WebAssembly. Right. We are redirecting to WebAssembly. WebAs. WebAs. Right. And so,"
1698720,1706000," the way you compile to WebAssembly in Clang, you have to say that the target is going to be WebAssembly."
1706000,1711840," So, build. There we go. So, we have a lot of things in here. So, for instance, yeah. So,"
1711840,1717040," we have to do target was in 32. Oh, yeah. Here's an interesting thing. Here's an interesting thing."
1717040,1723920," To compile this simple snake game to WebAssembly, I had to say no standard libraries, because standard"
1723920,1729360," libraries are not implemented for WebAssembly. They are not implemented for WebAssembly. And that's"
1729360,1735840," probably the reason why you need to have mscripten. That is probably literally the reason why you need"
1735840,1742880," to have mscripten. To implement the standard libraries that are not implemented. But there is another side to"
1742880,1752240," the story, honestly. There is another side to the story. Right. If you rely completely on RayLib interface,"
1752240,1758560," your application doesn't really need standard library, does it? Unless it's doing something"
1758560,1766080," platform-specific, like working with files and everything. But if you just want to display"
1766080,1772240," something, you don't need standard library. I didn't use standard C library to implement this."
1772240,1775680," And the entirety of the game is under 1,000 lines of code."
1775680,1785280," SQRT, well, I mean, this is a math library. This is a math library. But maybe it's a part of the standard"
1785280,1789440," library. You can argue that it's a part of the standard library. So you know how I solved that?"
1789440,1793440," Do you know how I solved the lack of math library? Right. I can show you."
1793440,1804480," I can show you. I think I just didn't use SQRT. Yeah. I think I literally didn't use SQRT. That's how I solved it."
1806720,1814560," All right. So let's actually see. Where is the game? Yeah, there we go. SQRT. Oh!"
1814560,1819280," What the fuck?"
1819280,1829600," Holy shit. This is so fucking bad. I don't remember doing that. What the fuck?"
1833680,1836400," This is so fucking bass. Like what the fuck?"
1836400,1845200," Just... Oh my god. Oh my god. We don't have SQRT on our platform."
1845200,1848640," Get out of here. Implement SQRT yourself."
1848640,1857520," Was I that much of a chat back then? I don't fucking remember actually. It's just like..."
1861440,1868160," Okay. The way I usually do that... The way I usually do that is that I would make a SQRT part of the"
1868160,1877200," platform. Right. Part of the platform and I would just call to JavaScript. Right. So it's not even"
1877200,1882080," that fast. It's probably slow, but I mean it's fast enough for this application. Right. So..."
1882080,1889280," Okay. Listen, listen. So these kind of conversations are so hypocritical. I swear to god. Right. So we're"
1889280,1894640," talking about ""Oh no! This algorithm is slow!"" And then we're using Electron for desktop applications."
1894640,1905840," Excuse me? Like... What is this even conversation? Like how is that slow if you're using Electron for"
1905840,1914800," desktops? Like this is absolutely hypocritical. Right. Wait a second. I think I even made a tweet about"
1914800,1922320," that some time ago when I was developing port. Yeah. Yeah. Like I was developing ports. It's just like..."
1922320,1929840," When I was developing ports and my target platform was directly generating x6664 assembly. Right. So that"
1929840,1936560," was my target platform. And like a lot of people told me, ""Bruh! Bruh! You have to use LLVM! Bruh! Bruh!"
1936560,1943200," Because all the optimization! Bruh! Bruh!"" And the same motherfucking people go then to their 9 to 5 job and"
1943200,1952240," program in Python. Right. They program in Python on their 9 to 5 job and then come to me and tell me, ""Bruh!"
1952240,1957120," You have to use LLVM! Because optimizations!"" So it's just like... And there's a lot of conversations"
1957120,1967760," like that. Yeah. It is slow. So what?"
1967760,1981840," Anyways. Who cares? Exactly. So the fact that Python is the most popular language on planet Earth"
1982880,1989440," kind of invalidates all of the conversation about performance, honestly. Including all of the..."
1989440,1992000," Including the ones even I started. So yeah."
1992000,2000560," Anyways. So what do we have in here? Yeah. So in case of a math library, what I want to say is"
2000560,2005680," that we can just like bind to JavaScript functions. Right. So we can literally bind to math security."
2005680,2010960," So it's not that big of a deal. And this is something that I've done before. This is something"
2010960,2018000," that I've done before. So that's totally fine. That's totally fine. So and because we need the"
2018000,2022960," standard library. Right. So we won't be able to just compile this entire thing. Right. So we literally"
2022960,2028160," won't be able to just compile this entire thing. So we can try that. Sure. Sure. We can just try that."
2028160,2033600," So here is the build sh. And when I'm going to go to make file. Right. So and then it can say"
2034320,2047040," target wasm32. By the way, wasm is probably the only 32 like platform that is out there."
2047040,2055520," Right. So maybe in embedded people still use 32 bits. But I mean, like any consumer machine is just"
2055520,2063120," 64. But wasm is still 32. And so there is a version of wasm that is 64. But I think it's still in"
2063120,2072080," development. It's still experimental. And the reason and the reason is because you can't address"
2072080,2081280," 64 bits. So so there is still arms that's 32. Okay. So and the reason is because you can't address"
2081280,2085920," 64 bits with the regular javascript numbers."
2088320,2091680," you must use big nums for that."
2091680,2103200," This is such a dumb reason. It's so fucking funny. I just like can't like when I was researching how to"
2103200,2110240," do wasm64. And I needed that because I was trying to compile Jai to to wasm and Jai supports only 64 bits"
2110240,2119280," and everything. I couldn't stop fucking laughing for the reason like it's so goddamn dumb in 2023. It was 20."
2119280,2122160," I think it was even 2021 2022 or something. Yeah."
2128800,2135920," It is what it is. It isn't what it isn't. Is it not? I think it is. Okay. So here we're gonna have like a native"
2135920,2142640," uh web. Right. So we're gonna have a native web. And I'm gonna try to compile this piece of Shaisung."
2142640,2153680," And what does it say? Uh wasm ld does not exist? Really? I don't have a wasm ld 14. So it wants to have wasm ld?"
2153680,2159520," Really? So I need to have wasm ld? Is that something I have to install separately though?"
2160240,2169760," Um, so there's a wabbit and there's some sort of other things. Because I remember it just worked."
2169760,2177840," Oh, for the snake I never really needed to link anything. Right. I never really needed to link anything."
2177840,2184720," That is not that bad of an idea, honestly, actually."
2187200,2191440," Yeah, I will consider that. I'll consider porting a mutualizer to web."
2191440,2199680," That actually may open up a lot of interesting like opportunities. Like imagine instead of like files using links to youtube"
2199680,2208640," dmca"
2208640,2215600," I'm in in the middle of siberian taiga, so"
2216480,2217120," You can't get me."
2217120,2222480," Let me start the tmix."
2222480,2224800," Let me start the tmix."
2224800,2228000," Search wasm."
2228000,2231600," Wasm wasm wasm wasm wasm wasm wasm wasm wasm wasm wasm"
2231600,2234400," BKNN"
2234400,2243200," BNIREN compiler and toolchain infrastructure for web assembly. I wonder if that's where it is located."
2243200,2243840," I want that."
2243840,2243840," I want that."
2243840,2259280," I don't know where it is like wasm wasm wasm not found after performing brew install wabbit."
2259280,2261520," Wabbit, wabbit, wabbit, wabbit."
2264640,2277280," Wabbit, wabbit, wabbit, wabbit, wabbit, wabbit."
2277920,2279520," So it's part of the llvm right?"
2284000,2296640," Wabbit, wabbit, wabbit, wabbit, wabbit, wabbit."
2297280,2300560," So installation first, I guess."
2300560,2303360," So we can just take a look at the llvm."
2303360,2305120," I wonder how for how long it's going to take."
2306640,2307760," So llvm."
2307760,2314160," Yeah, there's also a lot of things in here like llvm 14 modular compiler and toolchain technologies."
2314160,2319440," Okay, so it wants to have a llvm 14 because it was a wasm ld something something."
2319440,2325680," Okay, so let's actually install llvm 14 and so yeah, we'll probably have to do it like this."
2327280,2331120," A lot of things need to be installed first, a lot of things need to be installed first."
2331120,2344400," Huh, that is a bizarre, that is absolutely bizarre."
2344400,2348720," So I literally don't have wasm ld."
2348720,2356000," So maybe it is, I do have it on my machine, maybe, but it's somewhere else, right?"
2356000,2363840," So like people say file executable wasm ld or something, maybe."
2363840,2366320," Yeah, let's actually try to find that file."
2366320,2369520," Paths precede the expression."
2369520,2375520," Type f executable name."
2375520,2376880," Yeah, there we go."
2376880,2382320," So there's a wasm interp validate and some other things."
2386000,2391520," So let's install ld 14."
2391520,2394640," Yeah, probably so we can give it a try."
2394640,2394960," Sure."
2394960,2396480," Permission denied."
2396480,2399680," So let's see."
2399680,2402160," Search ld."
2407840,2410560," Lld lbm based linca."
2410560,2414480," So, by the way, apt search is kind of useless, don't you think?"
2414480,2419280," I think it's kind of useless because it's like it never actually shows you what you're looking for."
2419280,2421040," Like I was looking for wasm ld."
2421040,2422400," All right."
2422400,2425200," And it never maybe it showed me lld 14."
2425200,2426000," Maybe I didn't notice."
2426000,2430000," But I mean, it also likes to show a lot of things that are kind of irrelevant."
2430960,2432720," Right, so they're kind of irrelevant."
2432720,2435440," We're installing."
2435440,2443920," So wasm ld 14."
2443920,2444720," Look at that."
2444720,2445280," Thank you."
2445280,2448800," Thank you, a random viewer who actually suggested to install this thing."
2448800,2450000," I really appreciate it."
2450000,2453600," Okay, so let me see."
2453600,2455680," So I know that it's not going to work, by the way."
2455680,2457040," I know that it's not going to work."
2457040,2459760," I just want to see what kind of problems I'm going to bump into."
2459760,2462560," If I just try to do that in a very naive way."
2462560,2464320," Yeah, there we go."
2464320,2467360," Unable to find library, blah, blah, blah."
2467360,2471680," So it was also trying to find lm and some other things."
2471680,2475120," It's funny that it couldn't find this stuff, right?"
2475120,2476320," So that's kind of weird."
2476320,2477920," Not gonna lie."
2477920,2481440," So let me find file at point."
2481440,2481760," Yeah."
2485280,2487200," So isn't it that?"
2487200,2489200," Yeah, here it is."
2489200,2492000," And if I go into here, is that a lib?"
2492000,2492240," Yeah."
2492240,2495120," So what's up with that, my friend?"
2495120,2495760," What's up with that?"
2495760,2497760," Why it couldn't find anything?"
2497760,2502400," No such."
2502400,2502960," Yeah."
2502960,2504320," And also look at that."
2504320,2507600," It cannot find CRT1.0 and everything."
2507600,2514160," And as far as I know, CRT1.0 contains the actual entry point."
2514160,2517120," like it initializes runtime and stuff like that."
2517120,2518960," So yeah."
2518960,2521040," RT built-ins."
2521040,2523280," It also cannot find any of these things."
2523280,2528000," But I'm pretty sure I need to install some things for that stuff to actually work."
2528000,2528640," All right."
2528640,2532000," So I'm pretty sure I have to install that stuff to actually work."
2532000,2535280," You can search across Debian packages contained using Appetit file."
2535280,2537440," Maybe I can, but I can never remember how to use it."
2537440,2537760," Right."
2537760,2538960," Appetit file was an LD."
2538960,2541520," It's like how do I use that?"
2541520,2541840," Search."
2541840,2545120," Is it going to search?"
2545120,2546720," Okay."
2546720,2547520," So that was useful."
2547520,2547920," Thank you."
2547920,2551920," So tools and everything seems to be installed."
2551920,2553840," Right."
2553840,2556240," I wonder where we can find."
2556240,2557360," So that's actually very useful."
2557360,2557680," Thank you."
2557680,2558560," Okay."
2558560,2562960," Appetit file search."
2562960,2564800," Appetit file search."
2564800,2567280," And we're going to just do that with this."
2567280,2569200," Is it contained anywhere?"
2569200,2572320," So yeah, we have L."
2572320,2574400," So maybe we should install some of these things."
2574400,2574720," Right."
2574720,2577200," So we definitely should install the 14th one."
2577200,2578880," because that's the one that it searches for."
2578880,2580160," Yo."
2580160,2581760," That is very cool."
2581760,2582000," Okay."
2582000,2583040," So let's go ahead and do that."
2583040,2586240," So I'm going to install this library."
2586240,2592240," Maybe I should actually just have this thing open at the time."
2592240,2593680," All right."
2593680,2594720," Installing the runtime."
2594720,2596400," And it's already installed, by the way."
2596400,2598800," So it seems to be already installed."
2598800,2603200," And no, it still cannot find that."
2604720,2607200," So even though cannot open."
2607200,2608560," Yeah."
2608560,2610800," So there's a WASI lib."
2610800,2612320," Yeah."
2612320,2613920," It doesn't have any of that."
2613920,2616560," Even though we set find this thing."
2616560,2618960," And it says that it is available."
2618960,2622160," Appetit file search in here."
2622160,2623440," All right."
2623440,2624800," Appetit file search in here."
2624800,2626960," And yeah, here it is."
2626960,2628160," And I installed this thing."
2628160,2630400," I literally installed this thing."
2630400,2631600," And that didn't help."
2631600,2633760," So it still complains about all of these things."
2634320,2635200," So yeah."
2635200,2640880," Apparently, you do need mscripten to just build this entire thing."
2640880,2642320," To just build this entire thing."
2642320,2643920," Which is kind of a shame."
2643920,2644960," Which is kind of a shame."
2644960,2646000," And I do not approve that."
2646000,2652800," Because I believe it is possible to implement RayDeep way, way simpler."
2652800,2655360," The same way I implemented snake."
2655360,2660560," Like, I do believe that it is possible to do it like that."
2660560,2661120," Right."
2661120,2664640," So essentially, just implement all of these functions for WebAssembly."
2664640,2670720," So the only difference is going to be is that you would have to organize your entry point differently."
2670720,2671280," Right."
2671280,2676800," So I suppose the advantage of this approach of using inscripten and stuff like that."
2676800,2680240," You can take your entry point as it is."
2680240,2685680," You can take your entry point as it is and magically compile."
2685680,2688320," And it will just be a thing that you can run in a browser."
2688320,2689120," Right."
2689120,2689920," So, okay."
2689920,2690560," That's pretty cool."
2690560,2692560," But it adds a lot of moving parts to that."
2693840,2694240," Right."
2694240,2697520," So, and even an entry point has to be changed?"
2697520,2699920," Seriously."
2699920,2703440," Even an entry point has to be changed."
2703440,2709120," I keep getting disappointed."
2709120,2711120," I keep getting disappointed."
2711120,2711520," Okay."
2711520,2713040," Let's install mscripten."
2713040,2714320," Let's install mscripten."
2715120,2718320," So maybe we're going to follow the instructions."
2718320,2724720," First of all, I'm going to actually go and put these instructions in the description."
2724720,2724960," Right."
2724960,2726320," So that's the, that's the thing."
2726320,2727600," That's how you're supposed to do that."
2727600,2730880," Install mscripten SDK from."
2733520,2735840," I think, I think I know how to do that."
2735840,2737360," I think I've already done that before."
2737360,2741600," I'm scripting SDK."
2741600,2744400," SDK."
2744400,2750160," So, I'm going to just go Team Luke's software."
2750160,2751440," What do we have in here?"
2751440,2754320," Git clone this mother flipper in here."
2754320,2756640," So I wonder if it's going to be too much."
2756640,2759120," I could probably do something like depth one."
2759120,2761440," So let's actually not clone everything."
2762640,2764160," So we're going to do a shallow clone."
2764160,2765360," msdk."
2765360,2766800," Right."
2766800,2768800," And what's going to be the next thing?"
2768800,2772640," So it does have msdk in here."
2772640,2772880," Right."
2772880,2774320," It does have msdk in here."
2774320,2776640," Let's install latest."
2776640,2778080," Latest."
2778080,2782800," It is unpacking something, everyone."
2782800,2785120," Using Python 3 script."
2785120,2788560," Python 3 script."
2788560,2790320," Okay."
2790320,2792560," So let's actually see what else you need to do."
2793360,2795040," compile-raylib library."
2795040,2796160," Before compiling your game."
2796160,2797920," Right."
2797920,2801120," So you must recompile for HTML5."
2801120,2803120," Generating."
2803120,2805120," Well, I mean, we already have this thing."
2805120,2808000," So we probably don't need to do that."
2808000,2808960," Using makefiles."
2808960,2809920," It doesn't really matter."
2809920,2812080," Okay, bruh."
2812080,2814480," Building examples for web."
2814480,2819040," At this point, if you optionally want to compile provided examples."
2820080,2820880," Okay, finally."
2820880,2820880," Okay, finally."
2820880,2822560," Command line compilation."
2822560,2823200," So..."
2823200,2825440," MCC..."
2825440,2826880," Oh my god."
2826880,2828640," It tries to hide literally..."
2828640,2830240," Oh my god."
2830240,2830720," I see."
2830720,2839920," It's just like..."
2839920,2842080," It's one of these situations."
2842080,2845040," Bruh, just run this thing and forget about it."
2845040,2846800," Don't think how it works."
2846800,2848560," Don't think how it works."
2848560,2849200," Bruh."
2849200,2850560," Trust me."
2850560,2852240," Don't think about it."
2852240,2853360," It's one of those things."
2853360,2853760," I see."
2853760,2854880," Okay, damn it."
2854880,2859440," So..."
2859440,2860960," And step four is also important."
2860960,2862160," Change in entry point."
2862160,2862480," So..."
2862480,2865040," But they didn't provide any code."
2865040,2866640," So it was kind of weird."
2866640,2872000," Main reason to avoid use the standard loop is related to the way browsers work."
2872000,2877200," The browser needs to control the executed process and just allow single update draw execution."
2877760,2881200," So execution could be controlled and lock while required."
2881200,2884240," More details here to avoid the loop code must be slightly adapted."
2884240,2888080," So for the simple example on the code refactoring for web check."
2888080,2889680," Okay."
2889680,2892640," So..."
2892640,2894480," Yeah."
2894480,2897520," Using mscripten doesn't even make the whole process easier."
2897520,2900240," It doesn't even make the whole process easier."
2900240,2901280," In fact, it just like..."
2901280,2902560," Yeah."
2903840,2904160," Oh."
2904160,2905520," Oh, my God."
2905520,2906800," Oh, my God."
2906800,2913120," I..."
2913120,2914160," You know what I want to do?"
2914160,2915600," You know what I want to do?"
2915600,2920720," I want to implement a very simple, small demo."
2920720,2922000," Very simple, small demo."
2922000,2925760," Maybe, you know, the classical bouncing off of the edges and stuff like that."
2925760,2930400," And implement a small subset of Raylib."
2930400,2936720," A small subset of Raylib that allows this demo work in a style of snake game."
2936720,2940640," I really want to try to do that."
2940640,2942960," As a sort of like a proof of concept."
2942960,2944240," Right."
2944240,2948560," So just to demonstrate that you don't really need that much of a complicated setup."
2948560,2950560," At least for myself."
2950560,2950800," Right."
2950800,2953120," So I just want to see like where is the pitfall."
2953120,2953280," Right."
2953280,2957520," So why do you really need this much of a complicated setup?"
2957520,2962320," Because as I already demonstrated, you don't need anything."
2962320,2962480," Right."
2962480,2964080," So you only need the Clang."
2964080,2966240," You don't even need the linker, by the way."
2966240,2967440," You don't even need the linker."
2967440,2974160," So but the only problem here is that in that case, you would have to implement Raylib in JavaScript primarily."
2976080,2980080," You would have to implement Raylib in JavaScript primarily."
2980080,2983600," So."
2983600,2988240," So, okay."
2988240,2990320," So I'm actually kind of half joking."
2990320,2990560," Right."
2990560,2995200," So Raysan is a really cool developer and he does in fact value simplicity."
2995840,3003040," The problem here is that the way I implemented snake is really unconventional way of doing that."
3003040,3007840," Nobody really documented properly how to do that."
3007840,3009840," And I kind of stitched that approach together."
3009840,3011120," Right."
3011120,3015680," So it's sort of like nobody really does it this way."
3015680,3019120," And because of that, nobody really knows that it could be this simple."
3019120,3021680," Yeah, that's the problem."
3021680,3023760," Like nobody knows that it could be this simple."
3024960,3029120," So people are afraid that there is no standard library."
3029120,3029360," Right."
3029360,3031760," People are really afraid that there is no standard library."
3031760,3033280," But here's the thing."
3033280,3037360," Before being afraid of the lack of the standard library, you really need to ask yourself."
3037360,3039840," How much of the standard library do I use?"
3039840,3045040," And if the answer is none, the question is, what are you afraid of?"
3045040,3047280," Then you don't use the standard library."
3047280,3048800," Right."
3048800,3050800," Because here I don't use the standard library at all."
3054880,3058880," So it's unconventional doesn't mean it needs to be like that."
3058880,3059440," Yeah, exactly."
3059440,3067360," So I really want to see like if arraylib could be implemented like simpler and without mscripten."
3067360,3069920," But first of all, I want to make the mscripten version work."
3069920,3070240," Right."
3070240,3073840," So, but I feel like I'm going to have a little bit of a hard time doing that."
3073840,3075360," So we'll see."
3075360,3075840," We'll see."
3075840,3075840," We'll see."
3075840,3075840," We'll see."
3075840,3075840," We'll see."
3075840,3075840," We'll see."
3075840,3075840," We'll see."
3075840,3075840," We'll see."
3075840,3075840," We'll see."
3075840,3075840," We'll see."
3075840,3075840," We'll see."
3075840,3075840," We'll see."
3075840,3076720," We'll see."
3076720,3076880," We'll see."
3076880,3077600," So without."
3077600,3079360," So there's with asyncify."
3079360,3082400," There's some sort of asyncify, not asyncify."
3082400,3083680," Oh my god."
3083680,3085680," Oh my god."
3085680,3087680," Oh my god."
3087680,3089120," Shell hd."
3089120,3090400," Oh boy."
3090400,3091280," Oh boy."
3091280,3092240," Oh boy."
3092240,3094160," There's a lot of web crap."
3094160,3096160," Anyways."
3096160,3097760," So let's actually take a look at this thing."
3097760,3098080," Right."
3098080,3101360," So, um, so MCC did it, did it work?"
3101360,3101600," Right."
3101600,3109280," So I, I know that with mscripten, with mscripten, you also have to activate the latest one."
3109280,3109440," Right."
3109440,3111040," So we have to activate the latest one."
3111040,3114880," So the latest one was a successfully activated."
3114880,3118000," And as far as I know, it already kind of, uh, no, it didn't."
3118000,3121360," So this can be, so I want to do this thing."
3121360,3122560," All right."
3122560,3124800," So to bring this thing to my shell."
3125520,3128480," So that means now here I have MCC."
3128480,3129040," Right."
3129040,3130480," So it's taking some time to load up."
3130480,3132080," So that means it does exist."
3132080,3135680," And I suppose I also want to add that to my bash profile."
3135680,3139920," So every time I open a new terminal, so I do have MCC all the time."
3139920,3140160," Right."
3140160,3140800," So that makes sense."
3140800,3143200," So we installed, uh, mscripten."
3143200,3143520," Right."
3143520,3146800," So that's how easy it is."
3146800,3148240," That's how easy it is."
3148240,3151200," Just run a bunch of scripts and don't think about that dummy."
3153520,3155120," So, uh, yeah."
3155120,3156640," All right."
3156640,3158160," So that should be enough."
3158160,3159600," I think that should be enough."
3159600,3162000," Um, and, um, yeah."
3162000,3167200," Um, do, do, do, do, do."
3167200,3170000," No."
3170000,3173840," So I wonder if I still have MCC."
3173840,3180320," No, I don't have MCC because bash profile is not applicable in here."
3180320,3185440," So that literally means that for the time being, I have to start Emacs from within this shell."
3185440,3187280," Okay."
3187280,3189840," That is, that is totally fine."
3189840,3190160," Okay."
3190160,3190560," Sure."
3190560,3191600," MCC."
3191600,3192240," Yeah, there we go."
3192240,3193520," So here's MCC."
3193520,3201200," Now, uh, so probe array lib wasm probe."
3203920,3206000," So main web."
3206000,3207040," Okay."
3207040,3210800," So if the output is game dot HTML."
3210800,3214560," So I suppose that's going to be the target then."
3214560,3218880," So this is the target and dependency is going to be main dot C."
3220480,3221360," Uh, all right."
3221360,3222880," So game dot HTML."
3222880,3226640," Um, so maybe I'm going to rename this to game."
3226640,3227840," Let's actually call it game."
3227840,3229760," I kind of like the fact that it's called game."
3229760,3231360," Uh, right."
3231360,3232640," So it's going to be something like that."
3232640,3235280," And let's query replace main with game."
3235280,3237600," Boom."
3237600,3242480," So game HTML, game dot C, make it small."
3243040,3244240," Path to this thing."
3244240,3249200," Um, so it was something like, uh, array."
3249200,3250960," Can you auto complete, please?"
3250960,3252320," Please, please, please."
3252320,3253280," Auto complete, please."
3253280,3255680," Stupid Emacs."
3255680,3257920," Stupid mother flipping Emacs."
3257920,3258880," So dumb."
3258880,3259360," Okay."
3259360,3260080," Just a second."
3260080,3261280," Just a second, please."
3261280,3270400," So then we have lib and lib array lib dot A."
3270400,3270640," Right."
3270640,3271520," So that's what we had."
3272240,3272960," Uh huh."
3272960,3276400," So then we have include path."
3276400,3283040," White puts this stuff in here."
3283040,3284720," This is a such a weird command line."
3284720,3285440," Wait a second."
3285440,3289040," So why do we have a really like twice?"
3289040,3294720," This is the."
3294720,3297440," I apologize."
3301440,3302240," Use GL."
3302240,3302960," Okay."
3302960,3304960," So there's also a shell file."
3304960,3307040," It's a little bit sus."
3307040,3308080," No, I'm going to lie."
3308080,3309040," It's a little bit sus."
3309040,3311600," I feel like it should not be the thing."
3311600,3311760," Right."
3311760,3312560," So if we are."
3312560,3314160," Yeah."
3314160,3316160," So it should be just like that."
3318720,3320720," And also the order is kind of weird."
3320720,3324960," The order is a little bit weird."
3324960,3327040," You know what?"
3327040,3327360," I think."
3327360,3333440," I just like to start maybe with simply trying to compile it like that."
3333440,3333600," Right."
3333600,3337200," So there's a lot of weird command lines that it's just like don't understand."
3337200,3338640," Like why does it have to be like that?"
3338640,3340000," Let's actually start with something simple."
3340560,3343840," So no ruled a target main C because this is called game."
3343840,3344160," Right."
3344160,3344400," So."
3344400,3345920," Okay."
3345920,3348400," So and let's take a look at this stuff."
3348400,3348800," Okay."
3348800,3352480," So I really like to sort of incrementally work on this thing."
3352480,3352720," Right."
3352720,3353840," So I encounter an error."
3353840,3355440," I fix an error and so on and so forth."
3355440,3357680," It's just like kind of easy for me to process."
3357680,3359040," Right."
3359040,3362800," And I also like to understand each individual command line argument that I put in there."
3362800,3363120," Right."
3363120,3364480," It's also kind of important for me."
3364480,3365520," Right."
3365520,3371040," As you probably noticed, I don't like to copy paste these single commands and don't think about it."
3371040,3372640," Like it's not for you."
3372640,3374240," It's like you don't think about it."
3374240,3376640," Smarter people than you already thought everything out."
3376640,3379360," Don't think about it."
3379360,3381280," Sorry."
3381280,3386240," So and then we want to probably just do this kind of thing."
3386240,3386480," Right."
3386480,3388160," So we want to do this kind of thing."
3388160,3389360," And let me see."
3389360,3390880," So."
3390880,3391840," Right."
3391840,3393360," So unable to find."
3393360,3393920," Yeah, that is."
3393920,3396800," That in fact makes sense."
3396800,3397680," So that means now."
3397680,3399600," Right."
3399600,3404720," Okay."
3404720,3404960," So."
3404960,3406240," Aha."
3406240,3407200," So."
3407200,3408000," And here is the thing."
3408000,3409600," So it complains about jlfw."
3409600,3410160," Notice that."
3410160,3412960," Oh my god."
3419120,3425600," If they used the approach that I used in snake."
3425600,3430400," They could have just used webgl for the web part of the of the Raylib."
3431280,3431600," So."
3431600,3434080," Hmm."
3434080,3437200," That is really interesting."
3437200,3438720," That is really interesting."
3438720,3439360," It's just like."
3439360,3440960," Yeah."
3440960,3444400," I can see a lot of ways this entire thing could be simplified."
3444400,3447120," I see a lot of ways this thing could be simplified."
3447120,3447440," Anyway."
3447440,3450160," So I don't know what is s."
3450160,3454640," But I suppose it's just like the thing that tells you to not use jlfw."
3456080,3456640," Right."
3456640,3457040," So okay."
3457040,3458080," So it's doing things."
3458080,3459840," It is doing things."
3459840,3461120," It's doing a lot of things actually."
3461120,3465680," It's compiling."
3465680,3467680," By the way."
3467680,3468960," So."
3470480,3471040," It's done."
3471040,3474240," Apparently it is."
3474240,3475600," Apparently it is."
3475600,3476720," So."
3476720,3478320," We have game.js."
3478320,3482000," Which is."
3482000,3488880," I suppose maybe it includes the entirety of the."
3488880,3492160," How is that a web assembly."
3492160,3495840," If we have 170 kilobytes of javascript."
3497760,3498320," Maybe the."
3498320,3500560," Look at that."
3500560,3506240," The web assembly module is smaller than the javascript part."
3506240,3515040," Am I complaining too much?"
3515040,3515280," Like."
3515280,3518480," It's just like."
3518480,3520080," It's like."
3520080,3522320," This is the kind of things that really bother me."
3522320,3524160," Because I'm a software engineer."
3524160,3524400," Right."
3524400,3526320," So engineer works with systems."
3526320,3526560," Right."
3526560,3527920," So in the systems are."
3527920,3529920," Different parts that interact with each other."
3529920,3530560," With each other."
3530560,3530800," Right."
3530800,3531520," So."
3531520,3533040," And I'm looking at this."
3533040,3533920," All of these systems."
3533920,3534160," And."
3534160,3537040," Everyone tells me that."
3537040,3537920," Like."
3537920,3538960," Don't think about it."
3538960,3540400," Don't think about it."
3540400,3544800," But I can't help myself."
3544800,3546240," But notice all of that stuff."
3546240,3546880," It's just like."
3546880,3550240," Am I."
3550240,3550960," Am I weird?"
3550960,3553120," Am I weird?"
3553120,3553760," Am I weird?"
3553760,3554320," Am I weird?"
3554320,3554320," Am I weird?"
3554320,3556320," Am I weird?"
3556320,3558320," Let's open it up."
3558320,3558800," Let's open it up."
3558800,3560640," Let's open it up."
3560640,3560720," Let's open it up."
3560720,3561760," You know what's funny is that."
3561760,3562720," I'm pretty sure we."
3562720,3565920," Won't be able to open it."
3565920,3567040," It depends on how."
3567040,3567520," Exactly."
3567520,3568160," They fetch."
3568160,3568960," There was a module."
3568960,3569280," Right?"
3569280,3569760," So."
3569760,3572480," Fetching there was a module."
3572480,3573840," May require doing that."
3573840,3575520," Specifically through HTTP server."
3575520,3576720," Because a certain."
3576720,3578320," Content type needs to be set up."
3578320,3579200," Otherwise the browser."
3579200,3585920," Okay."
3585920,3588000," Web support for Raylib."
3588000,3588880," Is literally."
3588880,3590480," All the things."
3590480,3592480," I was actually afraid of."
3592480,3594160," I mean."
3594160,3594960," But I mean."
3594960,3595840," For my thing."
3595840,3596720," For the snake."
3596720,3597680," You also need the server."
3598480,3599760," I know a way."
3599760,3600800," To actually make it."
3600800,3601760," Not require server."
3601760,3602800," By the way."
3602800,3603920," You can kind of bake."
3603920,3606000," Web assembly modules."
3606000,3607280," Into JavaScript."
3607280,3608000," You can."
3608000,3608720," Basically take."
3608720,3609680," You know."
3609680,3610800," Web assembly."
3610800,3611920," Byte code."
3611920,3612480," And save it."
3612480,3613680," As JavaScript array."
3613680,3615440," So."
3615440,3617200," I think I even."
3617200,3618000," Done that before."
3618000,3619200," I think I even."
3619200,3619920," Done that before."
3619920,3620240," Right?"
3620240,3620720," So."
3620720,3621040," I think."
3621040,3621680," I think."
3621680,3622560," I even have a project."
3622560,3623040," Somewhere."
3623040,3623840," That demonstrates."
3623840,3624240," That."
3624240,3625440," You have a single."
3625440,3626480," JavaScript file."
3626480,3627840," It's a single."
3627840,3628400," JavaScript file."
3628400,3629040," But it's also."
3629040,3630240," Written in web assembly."
3630240,3631920," So."
3631920,3632800," That's kind of interesting."
3632800,3633360," But anyway."
3633360,3634320," So."
3634320,3634960," All right."
3634960,3636960," Let's go ahead."
3636960,3638160," And try to open it."
3638160,3638880," And see."
3638880,3640400," How it is going to fail."
3640400,3640800," Right?"
3640800,3641440," I just want to see."
3641440,3642000," How it is."
3642000,3643760," Oh."
3643760,3644320," So."
3644320,3648320," That's why."
3648320,3649520," It takes so much space."
3649520,3650480," Because it's."
3650480,3652000," It's powered by."
3652000,3652720," In script."
3652720,3653360," In script."
3653360,3653360," In script."
3653360,3653920," In script."
3653920,3657360," I see."
3657360,3658960," So."
3658960,3663760," That's why."
3663760,3664800," That's why."
3664800,3666160," Anyways."
3666160,3666400," So."
3666400,3667200," Python 3."
3667200,3667600," M."
3667600,3668640," HTTPS."
3668640,3668880," Yes."
3668880,3669840," HTTP."
3669840,3671440," Server 69."
3671440,3671840," Oh."
3671840,3672880," 69."
3672880,3673600," Wait a second."
3673600,3674560," I did it incorrectly."
3674560,3680160," My neighbors are."
3680160,3681760," Doing something."
3681760,3683680," Something kinky."
3683680,3686640," 69."
3686640,3687280," 69."
3687280,3691040," Because it's not index."
3691040,3691680," I understand."
3691680,3708160," Okay."
3708160,3713520," So."
3713520,3714240," I think."
3714240,3714800," Another thing."
3714800,3715680," We forgot to do."
3715680,3716400," Actually."
3716400,3716960," Is."
3716960,3720480," Yeah."
3720480,3721520," I think we need to include."
3721520,3722640," All of these things in here."
3722640,3722800," So."
3722800,3723600," Asyncify."
3723600,3725040," And."
3725040,3725600," And that stuff."
3725600,3725840," So."
3725840,3726960," Let's actually try to recompile."
3726960,3728160," Of course."
3728160,3728640," Let's do."
3728640,3729200," Minus B."
3729200,3731760," Shell file."
3731760,3733040," Was not found."
3733040,3734960," Huh."
3734960,3735760," Shell file."
3735760,3737120," I have no idea."
3737120,3738400," What the fuck is a shell file."
3738400,3738720," So."
3738720,3739920," Maybe."
3739920,3740880," Fockit."
3740880,3743200," How about."
3743200,3743920," Fockit."
3743920,3745680," All right."
3745680,3745920," So."
3745920,3746240," Let's."
3746240,3747280," Let's just forget about that."
3750000,3751600," It just works."
3751600,3753120," It just twerks."
3753120,3760800," Any twerkers in the chat?"
3760800,3763680," Twerker class."
3769120,3774240," So."
3774240,3776160," Local."
3776160,3776880," Host."
3776880,3777760," 69."
3777760,3778480," 69."
3778480,3781120," You need to edit."
3781120,3781440," Yeah."
3781440,3782400," Oh yeah."
3782400,3782720," I forgot."
3782720,3782880," Yeah."
3782880,3783280," That's right."
3783280,3783760," That's right."
3783760,3784320," It's."
3784320,3785200," It's not about."
3785200,3786240," Exception."
3786240,3786720," Thrown."
3786720,3787040," In."
3787040,3787200," In."
3787200,3787760," JavaScript."
3787760,3788960," GL."
3788960,3789360," Bind."
3789360,3789840," Texture."
3789840,3790160," Blah."
3790160,3790320," Blah."
3790320,3790640," Blah."
3790640,3790880," So."
3790880,3791200," It."
3791200,3791760," It couldn't."
3791760,3793520," Okay."
3793520,3794320," So."
3794320,3795120," Yeah."
3795120,3795600," Let's go."
3795600,3795920," And."
3795920,3796160," Just."
3796160,3796480," Update."
3796480,3797040," This entire."
3797040,3797520," Shise."
3797520,3798400," So."
3798400,3801120," Meet window."
3801120,3803280," Set FPS."
3803280,3806240," Draw."
3806240,3806720," Frame."
3806720,3807040," Wait."
3807040,3809200," Module."
3809200,3809680," Function."
3809680,3810480," Declaration."
3810480,3811040," Update."
3811040,3811280," And."
3811280,3811680," Draw."
3811680,3812080," One."
3812080,3812560," Frame."
3812560,3813120," So."
3813120,3813680," You kinda."
3813680,3829200," I see."
3829200,3829920," I see."
3829920,3831040," I'm gonna fucking cry."
3831040,3831440," Chats."
3831440,3832480," I'm gonna fucking cry."
3843120,3843680," Sure."
3843680,3844080," Sure."
3844080,3848240," That's."
3848240,3848320," That's."
3848320,3849680," That's the modern software development."
3849680,3850480," Right?"
3850480,3851920," That's the modern software development."
3851920,3854160," Sozin."
3854160,3854960," What's wrong with that?"
3854960,3857040," What's wrong with that?"
3857040,3859120," I just follow the instruction."
3859120,3859760," It just works."
3859760,3866720," What's wrong?"
3866720,3867600," What's wrong with that?"
3867600,3870880," Okay."
3870880,3871200," So."
3873680,3874640," There's nothing wrong with that."
3874640,3875200," Sozin."
3875200,3875760," Sozin."
3875760,3876320," Sozin."
3876320,3877440," You're being unreasonable, Sozin."
3877440,3878160," Sozin."
3878160,3878960," You're being unreasonable."
3878960,3883200," I'm sweeping the set main loop."
3883200,3885200," Yeah."
3885200,3886480," I think we'll be doing that."
3886480,3887200," So."
3887200,3887760," Essentially."
3887760,3893040," This is something that I had to organize myself also in Snake."
3893040,3895280," All right."
3895280,3898480," So let's try to maybe rebuild this entire thing."
3898480,3899200," And."
3899200,3899760," Let's go."
3903120,3903600," Compiling."
3903600,3905440," Compiling."
3905440,3909360," Compiling."
3909360,3915600," If you pass a Syncify flag, you don't need to update your C code."
3915600,3917840," But why chat trolling me?"
3917840,3919600," Right."
3919600,3921360," Why chat is trolling me right now?"
3921360,3923280," I don't quite understand my defrainder."
3924640,3925200," All right."
3925200,3925680," So."
3925680,3927680," Yeah."
3927680,3930480," So this shit didn't work."
3930480,3932800," Okay."
3932800,3933440," So currently."
3933440,3938080," That's really bizarre."
3938080,3940560," That is really, really bizarre."
3942080,3947760," So it's also, if we take a look at the, you know, at the console."
3947760,3948000," Right."
3948000,3949040," So we cannot read properties."
3949040,3951520," So bindTexture is something with bindTexture."
3951520,3953600," Right."
3953600,3955360," It's something with bindTexture."
3955360,3959840," So that is kind of bizarre."
3959840,3963200," So something with a Syncify."
3963200,3966000," So people say that maybe a Syncify should not be a thing."
3966000,3968240," Let's not actually pass it in there."
3968240,3969360," Maybe that will fix it."
3969360,3971520," Right."
3971520,3973440," Maybe that will fix it."
3973440,3982720," Of course, you have to wait half of an hour for these things to compile."
3982720,3986160," Nope."
3986160,3990720," I don't really know what's up with that."
3990720,3992880," So did I miss anything, by the way?"
3992880,3995920," So maybe I just, like, did something incorrectly."
3998400,3999360," So lpath."
3999360,4006880," So tell the linker that the game uses GLF3 internally and must be linked automatically."
4006880,4008080," Provides the implementation."
4008080,4008400," Okay."
4008400,4014480," All web needs a shell structure to load and run the game by default script."
4014480,4018400," It has a shell script, which can, but we can provide our own."
4018400,4020640," So we wouldn't really have to provide anything in here."
4023280,4025840," So do we compile a Raylib with mscripten?"
4025840,4030400," I'm using Raylib that is downloaded from the GitHub."
4030400,4032320," Right."
4032320,4035600," So I downloaded it from the GitHub and that's the one I'm using."
4035600,4035840," Right."
4035840,4037920," So here it is."
4037920,4040560," So this is WebAssembly and here is the thing."
4040560,4045280," So, and I kind of expect this thing to work, to just work, but it doesn't."
4045280,4047120," It actually doesn't work."
4048480,4051200," So do I have to build Raylib myself?"
4051200,4053760," I thought I could just, like, download this thing and it will just work."
4053760,4056880," So it's kind of interesting."
4056880,4057840," Like, I don't really know."
4057840,4063280," We can take a look at the move_init_window inside."
4063280,4064560," We can try, actually."
4064560,4068720," Init_window."
4070560,4073680," So maybe don't call init_window at all."
4073680,4074080," Right."
4074080,4075040," So something like that."
4075040,4076880," We can try that."
4076880,4079360," But I feel like we still need to initialize this thing."
4079360,4082480," I feel like we still need to initialize this thing."
4082480,4089600," By the way, I'm already telling you I'm not using web support from Raylib."
4089600,4091200," Like, for my purposes."
4091200,4092240," Like, I'm already telling you."
4092240,4095200," So I'm not using it if I need something."
4095200,4095440," Yeah."
4095440,4097040," So you can't use this kind of thing."
4098160,4098480," All right."
4098480,4105520," So the only hypothesis that I have is that we need to build Raylib ourselves."
4105520,4107760," That's the only hypothesis I have."
4107760,4109440," It's just, like, we need to build it ourselves."
4109440,4114720," So maybe there's some sort of a discrepancy between how it was built,"
4114720,4117120," right, and everything."
4117120,4119680," But it's just, like, yeah, it's kind of weird."
4119680,4121200," I don't think it's going to work that easily."
4121200,4122880," I don't think it's going to work."
4122880,4126000," So you know what I want to do?"
4126960,4128240," You know what I'm going to do?"
4128240,4129920," I want to make a small break."
4129920,4132320," I want to make a small break and make a cup of tea."
4132320,4138400," And after the break, I kind of want to implement my idea, my vision,"
4138400,4142640," my vision of how I would implement Raylib, right?"
4142640,4145040," So, I mean, web support for Raylib."
4145040,4147760," So I'm not going to implement, like, the entirety of Raylib, obviously, right?"
4147760,4149200," So only small subset."
4149200,4158000," But I want to see if this approach that I used in Snake is applicable to Raylib as well."
4158000,4159280," Because I feel like it is."
4159280,4162720," Like, everything is just, like, points out that, yeah, you can do it like that."
4162720,4164400," You can actually do it like that."
4164400,4170880," Because if I rhyme a game entirely using Raylib, I don't really need standard library of C."
4170880,4177360," So, and that means you can have, like, a second version of Raylib implemented entirely in JavaScript"
4178160,4180000," that just implements this interface."
4180000,4184000," And it should be much simpler to work with."
4184000,4186240," It is much simpler to work with, I'm telling you."
4186240,4189840," So, anyway, I didn't manage to make it work."
4189840,4196320," I'm pretty sure that I just have to build, really, myself with my version of mscripten."
4196320,4200720," Maybe there is some discrepancy between the versions of mscripten, I don't really know."
4200720,4205040," But I kind of, like, I kind of spent too much time on this kind of stuff."
4205040,4209280," And I want to do something interesting, you know, I want to do something interesting."
4209280,4210560," So, let's make a small break."
4210560,4211520," Let's make a cup of tea."
4211520,4217360," And we're going to go on an adventure and explore alternative approaches to implementing the,"
4217360,4219360," you know, platform-independent applications."
4219360,4221040," All right."
4221040,4224640," So, let's go ahead and try to do something cool."
4224640,4226320," Let's try to do something cool."
4226320,4230160," I'm going to go back with my think."
4230160,4230960," Right."
4230960,4234400," So, I'm actually going to leave setTargetFPS."
4234400,4239680," So, I want to have, like, the minimum example that I can play with, essentially."
4239680,4239920," Right."
4239920,4241600," So, just the minimum example."
4241600,4244160," And let me see."
4244160,4247040," So, we're not going to have anything except this."
4247040,4247280," Right."
4247280,4248800," So, this is the only thing we're going to have."
4248800,4254240," And here, I'm going to remove all of that mscripten stuff."
4254240,4257600," And I'm going to just try to rebuild the thing natively."
4257600,4261120," And if I run this thing natively, it creates the window."
4261120,4262320," So, that's actually pretty cool."
4262320,4269680," So, let me remove this wasm thing, this HTML, and this JavaScript thing."
4269680,4270000," Right."
4270000,4272240," So, we don't need any of that anymore."
4272240,4278560," And we're going to just try to compile game wasm based on game.c."
4279440,4279840," Right."
4279840,4287680," So, we're going to start with just clang and o game wasm game.c."
4287680,4292160," And I'm going to say that the target is going to be wasm32."
4292160,4293200," Right."
4293200,4296720," So, essentially, what it will do, it will just, like, try to compile the C code"
4297280,4300400," into, you know, wasm module."
4300400,4300800," Right."
4300800,4302240," Just the wasm module."
4302240,4305600," And if I try to do make game wasm."
4305600,4305840," Right."
4305840,4306720," Make game wasm."
4306720,4309440," As you can see, it doesn't know where is arraylib.h."
4309440,4311600," It doesn't know where is arraylib.h."
4311600,4313120," But that's totally fine."
4313120,4317440," So, we can actually use the headers from the Linux version."
4317440,4317680," Right."
4317680,4320000," I don't think it really matters, like, which headers we use."
4320000,4323760," because they're literally the same regardless of the platform or anything like that."
4323760,4324560," Okay."
4324560,4329600," So, as you can see, it cannot find any standard libraries or anything like that."
4329600,4331760," And that's one of the problems that we had."
4331760,4334800," To circumvent that problem, what we have to do, we have to say,"
4334800,4341600," no standard libraries, library, I think, library."
4341600,4346480," So, we can always steal some code from snake."
4346480,4347280," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
4347280,4351840," So, also, we don't have any entry."
4351840,4354000," Entry symbol not defined."
4354000,4354320," Right."
4354320,4358880," So, the reason why we don't have an entry symbol is because the entry symbol is actually not main."
4358880,4359280," Right."
4359280,4362080," So, you may say that we do have entry point, which is main."
4362080,4365200," On Linux, it is not actually main."
4365200,4366880," It is actually underscore start."
4366880,4368320," So, that's what it is."
4368320,4370800," So, you don't actually have an entry point in here."
4370800,4371360," You don't."
4371360,4372960," Right."
4372960,4375360," And essentially, what we can do,"
4376160,4377920," we have to say no entry point."
4377920,4378160," Right."
4378160,4379680," So, no entry."
4379680,4381920," I think that's what it suggested us to do."
4381920,4383120," Right."
4383120,4383920," So, let me see."
4383920,4386240," No entry to pass."
4386240,4387040," No entry to..."
4387040,4388320," Right."
4388320,4390880," So, I think we have to do that to the linker."
4390880,4391280," Right."
4391280,4394640," So, this flag is not part of the compiler."
4394640,4395840," It's part of the linker."
4395840,4397440," So, that's why we have to do something like this."
4397440,4400240," So, this is how you say that you pass the flag to the linker."
4401280,4402000," Right."
4402000,4403360," So, there we go."
4403360,4407120," So, now we have a bunch of undefined symbols."
4407120,4407360," Right."
4407360,4408880," Now we have a bunch of undefined symbols."
4408880,4415520," But, as far as I know, you can also tell clanks, like, allow undefined symbols."
4415520,4419040," Allow undefined symbols, if I'm not mistaken."
4419040,4421360," And I think it's also part of the linker."
4421360,4422160," Right."
4422960,4423520," And there we go."
4423520,4426960," We just compiled this entire example."
4426960,4429360," Without any modifications."
4429360,4431040," Without any modifications."
4431040,4431600," I repeat."
4431600,4434080," To WASM module."
4434080,4436480," That is 703 bytes."
4436480,4442320," Using the Zoysian way."
4442320,4444240," All right."
4444240,4447120," We can try to see, like, WASM to what."
4447120,4447360," Right."
4447360,4448240," So, WASM to what."
4448240,4449920," What kind of stuff do we even have in there?"
4449920,4450960," Right."
4450960,4452800," So, this is the actual WASM."
4452800,4453840," And what it says."
4453840,4459680," It expects these functions to be, you know, implemented for this module."
4459680,4462400," The module wants to have these functions."
4462400,4463840," And another thing it does."
4463840,4465760," It also exports the main."
4465760,4468000," It exports the main."
4468000,4472240," So, it does a bunch of coding here."
4472240,4472400," Right."
4472400,4474160," So, it probably organized the loop in here."
4474160,4475360," Loop."
4475360,4479600," So, as you can see, it calls to setTargetFPS."
4479600,4482000," Then, it calls to a window should close."
4482000,4485040," And as you can see, it's inside of the loop and stuff like that."
4485040,4487200," And here we have different things."
4487200,4487520," Right."
4487520,4488960," So, we have a memory."
4488960,4491120," We have a stack pointer and stuff like that."
4491120,4493040," So, and yeah."
4493040,4494240," We even have a string."
4494240,4495600," Hello from WebAssembly."
4495600,4497360," So, the only thing we need to do."
4497360,4500400," We need to load this module into the browser."
4500400,4500960," Right."
4500960,4502080," So, that's what we have to do."
4502080,4503920," We have to load this module into the browser."
4503920,4506720," And implement all of these functions, by the way."
4506720,4514320," You know what's interesting is that I feel like because we are organizing the loop ourselves."
4515040,4518560," And on each iteration of the loop we call window should close."
4518560,4530080," This is where we can do sort of like a continuation that calls to request the next frame or something like that."
4531840,4534240," That way we may try."
4534240,4536000," I do not promise that we will succeed."
4536000,4541440," But we may try to make it so you don't even have to modify this thing."
4544560,4546480," You don't even have to modify it."
4546480,4548400," But I'm not going to promise that."
4548400,4549840," I'm not sure if it's going to work."
4549840,4553120," But if we manage to do that, that would be fucking epic."
4553120,4557920," But I feel like it should be kind of possible."
4557920,4558880," You know what I'm talking about?"
4558880,4560560," I feel like it should be kind of possible."
4560560,4561840," Yeah."
4561840,4562560," It should be."
4562560,4562880," We'll see."
4562880,4563600," We'll see."
4563600,4564160," Anyways."
4564160,4566320," So, let's create a game HTML."
4566320,4566720," So, yeah."
4566720,4570720," Unfortunately, you have to generate like create your own HTML thing here."
4570720,4570880," Right."
4570880,4572000," So, that's kind of inevitable."
4572000,4573600," But I mean, it is what it is."
4573600,4576800," So, let's do doc type HTML."
4576800,4577120," Right."
4577120,4578080," So, do we have..."
4578080,4580480," Is this how we do doc type?"
4580480,4581360," It's kind of weird."
4581360,4582480," So, this is HTML."
4582480,4585280," And, yeah."
4585280,4586080," Let me revert."
4586080,4587680," I never know."
4587680,4590080," So, I just didn't recognize it properly."
4590080,4591280," So, we're going to have head."
4591280,4592640," Right."
4592640,4594800," And head, we're going to have the title."
4594800,4600480," Which says ""Hello, Raylib""."
4600480,4601440," Hello, Raylib."
4601440,4603200," And then we're going to have a body."
4604160,4605280," And this is the body."
4605280,4608560," And I suppose in here, we need to have a canvas."
4608560,4608800," Right."
4608800,4609840," So, we need to have a canvas."
4609840,4611760," And this is going to be the canvas for the game."
4611760,4612000," Right."
4612000,4612960," So, that's the canvas."
4612960,4615840," And we're also going to have a script."
4615840,4616320," All right."
4616320,4620240," So, the script that does the loading and stuff like that."
4620240,4622640," So, I suppose we're probably going to do something like SRC."
4624800,4625680," ""Raylib.js""."
4625680,4626800," ""Raylib.js""."
4626800,4627120," Right."
4627120,4629440," So, that's probably what I want to have in here."
4629440,4631040," So, it's going to be ""Raylib.js""."
4631040,4632880," So, you'll just use it like that."
4632880,4635600," Right."
4636960,4640800," So, let's try to maybe open this entire thing in a browser."
4640800,4645360," Although, we'll probably have to open it like through a server."
4645360,4645600," Right."
4645600,4646480," Because it's a WebAssembly."
4646480,4647920," WebAssembly requires your server."
4648640,4655360," So, I'm going to do the usual Python 3m HTTP server 6969."
4655360,4656240," Boom."
4656240,4658720," So, we already have that, right?"
4658720,4661600," I think I already have the server running."
4661600,4664880," So, yeah, here it is."
4664880,4665040," Okay."
4665040,4668560," So, I could probably rename this entire thing."
4668560,4670160," I'm going to say ""server""."
4670160,4670400," Right."
4670400,4671840," So, this is the server."
4671840,4672640," And we can go..."
4672640,4672880," Okay."
4672880,4673760," Let's close all of that."
4673760,4674880," It's not needed."
4675680,4677280," Let's open ""GameHTML""."
4677280,4678400," There we go."
4678400,4680880," And let's open ""DevTools""."
4680880,4685360," So, in the ""DevTools"", it couldn't load ""Raylib.js"", which is understandable."
4685360,4687760," I just want to take a look at all of these things."
4687760,4688880," So, here is the..."
4688880,4689600," It's inside..."
4689600,4691280," Wait, did I..."
4691280,4692400," What the fuck did I do?"
4692400,4693280," Why is it like that?"
4693280,4697360," So, ""GameHTML""."
4697360,4701120," Yeah."
4701120,4702080," So, maybe..."
4702080,4702960," Let's do ""Canvas""."
4704640,4705600," That was weird."
4705600,4705840," Yeah."
4705840,4707280," So, ""Canvas"" has to be a separate thing."
4707280,4708480," Script is a separate thing."
4708480,4710640," And everyone is happy."
4710640,4713760," So, a ""Canvas"" is actually rather small, like this."
4713760,4715920," We probably need to center it."
4715920,4720800," We need to center the div."
4720800,4724400," So, this is the ""Canvas""."
4724400,4727040," Right."
4727040,4728080," Let's try to center it."
4728080,4728560," Okay."
4728560,4733360," So, we need to create maybe ""GameCSS""."
4733360,4733760," Right."
4733760,4735600," So, let's do ""GameCSS""."
4735600,4737760," And how do you include CSS into HTML?"
4737760,4743280," So, ""Include CSS into HTML""."
4743280,4744400," So, something like ""Link""."
4744400,4751840," I kind of vaguely remember that it's ""Link type style sheet"" or something like that."
4751840,4754320," But I can never kind of remember that for some reason."
4755040,4756560," I can never remember that."
4756560,4760240," So, ""Link rel stylesheet href""."
4760240,4760720," Yeah."
4760720,4761440," Obviously."
4761440,4762240," Very intuitive."
4762240,4763280," Very easy to remember."
4763280,4765200," ""Stylesheet""."
4765200,4772480," ""Stylesheet"" and ""href"", which is going to be ""GameCSS""."
4772480,4772720," Right."
4772720,4773920," So, that's what we have in here."
4773920,4776400," We don't even have to do anything in here."
4776400,4776640," Okay."
4776640,4778720," So, we're going to do that in there."
4778720,4782640," So, and here's the ""GameCSS""."
4782640,4783680," And yeah."
4783680,4786160," We're ready to rock and roll."
4786160,4788080," So, the first thing we need to do."
4788080,4790320," We need to take the ID of the game."
4790320,4792400," So, we have ID as the game."
4792400,4793440," Right."
4793440,4795200," First of all, ""PositionAbsolute""."
4795200,4801840," Okay."
4801840,4807680," So, in ""PositionAbsolute"", it makes it super easy to just do this kind of thing."
4807680,4809200," So, I think stop 50%."
4809200,4810880," Right."
4810880,4812400," And then left 50%."
4812400,4812640," Right."
4812640,4813520," So, that's how we do that."
4813520,4815200," If I'm not mistaken."
4815200,4815520," Right."
4815520,4816800," So, yo."
4816800,4820080," Yo."
4820080,4821040," We're already kind of done."
4821040,4821920," You cannot see that."
4821920,4824800," But, I mean, it's kind of done."
4824800,4825120," Right."
4825120,4826400," So, yeah."
4826400,4826960," It's there."
4826960,4831200," So, we just need to move it halfway to the, you know, left top."
4831200,4834480," So, I remember it's ""CSSTransform""."
4834480,4836240," ""Transition"" something."
4836240,4836400," Right."
4836400,4839520," So, you can apply different sort of transformations to CSS."
4839520,4841360," So, CSS transitions."
4841360,4843360," Right."
4843360,4844560," So, yeah."
4844560,4847200," You can do, not ""Transition""."
4847200,4849280," ""Transform""."
4849280,4850320," ""Translate""."
4851520,4852400," ""Translate""."
4852400,4853360," ""Translate""."
4853360,4854560," ""Translate""."
4854560,4855280," ""Translate""."
4855280,4855840," ""Translate""."
4855840,4856960," ""Translate""."
4856960,4857600," ""Translate""."
4857600,4858160," ""Translate""."
4858160,4859040," ""Translate""."
4859040,4859360," Yo."
4859360,4859840," ""Translate""."
4859840,4861440," So, yeah."
4861440,4863760," Transform and you just do this kind of shit."
4863760,4865600," So, where can I copy paste it?"
4865600,4866080," Yeah."
4866080,4866800," Boy."
4866800,4867360," Yeah."
4867360,4867680," Boy."
4867680,4869120," Yeah."
4869120,4869600," Boy."
4869600,4869920," Yeah."
4869920,4870160," Boy."
4870160,4871040," Yeah."
4871040,4874640," And essentially what we do is like minus 50% on both of them."
4874640,4877680," So, minus 50% on both of them."
4878880,4880080," I centered the div."
4880080,4883920," Am I hired as a web dev?"
4883920,4885520," Am I hired as a web dev?"
4885520,4887120," I used Google, so I probably know it."
4887120,4888960," But I centered the div."
4888960,4891520," I know how to center the div, mother flippers."
4899520,4901360," You know CSS a little bit."
4901360,4901840," A little bit."
4901840,4903840," Higher defined."
4903840,4904080," Yeah."
4904080,4904400," I know."
4904400,4906560," Position absolutes."
4906560,4906880," Right."
4906880,4907760," Position absolutes."
4907760,4910240," Anyway."
4910240,4914240," So, as far as I know, there's like tons of different ways to center the element."
4914240,4916400," And it's just like, it's probably the easiest one."
4916400,4916640," Right."
4916640,4919840," It's probably the easiest one."
4919840,4924720," So, another interesting thing is that we probably want to, like Canvas, to take the entirety of the window."
4924720,4925520," Of the window."
4925520,4925680," Right."
4925680,4929360," But I mean, we can make it take the entirety of the height."
4929360,4929680," Right."
4929680,4932640," So, height 100%."
4932640,4932960," Right."
4932960,4936000," So, at least this is how I do that in snake."
4936000,4936880," Right."
4936880,4938000," So, there we go."
4938000,4941840," So, it kind of takes the entirety of this thing."
4941840,4943200," Right."
4943200,4944320," So, yeah."
4944320,4944960," So, that's pretty cool."
4944960,4947040," But it also centers it and everything."
4947040,4950080," So, I actually want to do something like this."
4950080,4951600," So, it's a little bit more of this."
4951600,4951840," Yeah."
4951840,4952160," There we go."
4952160,4954560," So, that's the, that's the canvas."
4954560,4961200," And if you change the size, it fits, it basically fits the entire like height of the canvas."
4961200,4965200," So, it's pretty convenient."
4965200,4965360," Yeah."
4965360,4966400," I think it's, I think it's fine."
4966400,4970240," It's just like, you know, five, five lines of CSS."
4970240,4972480," Can your C do that?"
4972480,4973920," I don't fucking think so."
4973920,4976880," C developers are seething and coping right now."
4976880,4977360," What the?"
4980640,4986240," The god damn C developers don't know any shit about web development."
4986240,4996640," Anyways."
4996640,4999760," I think I'm going fucking crazy."
4999760,5001920," So, Raylib."
5001920,5008080," If we go to raylib.js, so we don't even have that, raylib.js."
5009360,5014160," If I'm not mistaken, the first thing we have to do, we have to fetch game wasm."
5014160,5015600," That's the first thing we have to do."
5015600,5018400," And essentially, we can even console log this big."
5018400,5025200," Though, can I just say document on load."
5025200,5026400," Right."
5026400,5033600," I don't know what the fuck I'm doing."
5033600,5034080," I'm sorry."
5034080,5036880," Can I do shit like this?"
5036880,5040240," Or is it window unload?"
5040240,5041120," I don't remember."
5041120,5041920," Who remembers?"
5041920,5043520," Is that a window or documents?"
5043520,5045520," Who remembers this shit?"
5045520,5047120," It's a window."
5047120,5047360," Okay."
5047360,5048000," Thank you so much."
5048000,5049200," I'm not a web developer."
5049200,5049600," I'm sorry."
5049600,5051520," Like, I don't know how to do this kind of thing."
5052320,5053600," So, okay."
5053600,5054960," Module."
5054960,5056080," So, wasm."
5056080,5058240," So, we're going to await this thing."
5058240,5062720," And let's just do console log wasm."
5062720,5062960," Right."
5062960,5065920," So, let me see."
5065920,5066560," Let me see."
5066560,5067120," Boom."
5067120,5069680," Did you load it?"
5069680,5070880," Did you fucking load it?"
5070880,5071920," I think I didn't load it."
5071920,5075040," Motherflipper."
5076160,5076800," Big."
5076800,5077120," Okay."
5077120,5080400," Console log on load."
5080400,5082960," Disappointing."
5082960,5083920," Yeah."
5083920,5084880," It doesn't do shit."
5084880,5086720," Right."
5086720,5087360," Window add."
5087360,5089760," Maybe we can do that."
5089760,5093520," But you should better use window add event listener."
5093520,5096880," Okay."
5096880,5099600," I mean, how did I do that in snake?"
5099600,5100320," Let me remember."
5100320,5102880," Snake index.html."
5102880,5104160," It's actually wasm."
5104160,5105360," Yeah."
5105360,5105920," JS."
5105920,5107520," Oh."
5107520,5109520," I see."
5109520,5111040," I didn't give a shit, actually."
5111040,5113600," That may be actually even better."
5113600,5113920," Yeah."
5113920,5116800," So, WebAssembly has instantiate streaming."
5116800,5120720," So, you can just fetch this thing and instantly, like, instantiate and everything."
5120720,5122320," We can do a similar thing."
5122320,5123600," I think that's even better."
5123600,5123840," Right."
5123840,5124400," And then."
5124400,5125440," And then."
5125440,5125840," And here."
5125840,5128240," That is kind of dumb."
5128240,5128640," But, yeah."
5128640,5131440," It's document chat."
5132480,5132880," Mods."
5132880,5139360," Permavan."
5139360,5141840," Fucking permavan."
5141840,5144080," Okay."
5144080,5149280," Goddamn web developers."
5149280,5152240," Still doesn't work."
5152240,5154400," Okay."
5154400,5154720," Whatever."
5154720,5156560," I'm done with this shit."
5156560,5158880," Wait."
5158880,5159840," Did I actually."
5159840,5162720," Maybe I forgot to include this in that thing."
5162720,5163360," So."
5163360,5165360," Yeah."
5165360,5168000," I think it actually fetches everything correctly."
5168000,5168240," Right."
5168240,5170080," So, it does in fact fetch everything correctly."
5170960,5172400," assembly."
5172400,5175920," Instantiate streaming."
5175920,5177120," And we can do fetch."
5177120,5178960," We can do this fetch thingy."
5178960,5180880," Right."
5180880,5181840," Like so."
5181840,5184800," And we have to also provide the implementations."
5184800,5186160," But who cares."
5186160,5186480," All right."
5186480,5187280," So, then."
5187280,5189680," When we get the W thingy."
5190240,5191440," We're going to do console."
5191440,5192160," Log."
5192160,5197360," So, game instantiated."
5197360,5198720," Game instantiated."
5198720,5202240," And we can provide the module that got instantiated."
5202240,5202480," Right."
5203040,5204960," So, let's refresh this entire."
5204960,5205600," Scheiße."
5205600,5206080," Uncode."
5206080,5206720," WebAssembly."
5206720,5207200," Module."
5207200,5207680," Environment."
5207680,5210720," Module is not an object or a function."
5210720,5211040," Right."
5211040,5211920," So, as far as I know."
5211920,5214080," You also have to provide something like env."
5214080,5214400," Right."
5214400,5216320," So, this is where you're going to have all of the functions."
5216320,5217520," Yeah."
5217520,5218640," Import env."
5218640,5220000," Function init window."
5220000,5221200," Function."
5221200,5223920," It wants a function called init window."
5223920,5224160," Right."
5224160,5224880," So, what we have to do."
5224880,5226800," We have to do init window."
5226800,5229600," We're already implementing Raylib chat."
5230400,5232160," So, here you can do width and height."
5232160,5234080," And then title."
5234080,5236880," So, in here you can say."
5236880,5237200," Okay."
5237200,5239520," Console.log."
5239520,5241280," Width."
5241280,5242160," Init window."
5242160,5242400," Right."
5242400,5243120," Init window."
5243120,5246400," So, maybe something like."
5246400,5247920," Width."
5247920,5248320," Height."
5248320,5249520," Title."
5249520,5251200," There we go."
5251200,5253600," So, that's basically what we have in here."
5253600,5255520," So, now setTargetFPS."
5255520,5257200," Let's implement setTargetFPS."
5258240,5258880," In fact."
5258880,5260720," I remember in snake."
5260720,5262160," Maybe not even in snake."
5262160,5262400," But."
5262400,5263920," I had."
5263920,5266240," Aha."
5266240,5268480," Yeah."
5268480,5268800," I."
5268800,5270080," In olivets."
5270080,5271680," Specifically in olivets."
5271680,5272560," I do remember that."
5272560,5275280," I had a pretty cool thing."
5275280,5277280," That basically."
5277280,5280160," Automatically implements all of the necessary functions."
5280160,5281600," All of them."
5281600,5282400," Right."
5282400,5283280," And it is called."
5283280,5284320," Make environment."
5284320,5285120," So, browser run."
5285120,5285600," Oh yeah."
5285600,5286240," This one."
5286240,5287200," So, essentially."
5287200,5289840," It creates a proxy."
5289840,5290720," That provides you."
5290720,5293200," Default implementation."
5293200,5296320," For literally all of these things."
5296320,5297360," And what it does."
5297360,5297840," Just says."
5297840,5298640," Console error."
5298640,5299440," Not implemented."
5299440,5300640," Right."
5300640,5303360," So, now."
5303360,5304720," I'm going to take this entire thing."
5304720,5305920," And I'm going to actually copy."
5305920,5307520," This to Rayleigh."
5307520,5308720," Because I think it is useful."
5308720,5310000," So, that will allow you to."
5310480,5311120," Actually."
5311120,5312400," Just do the following thing."
5312400,5313840," Make environment."
5313840,5315280," And just wrap it like that."
5315280,5316000," And that's it."
5316000,5316240," Right."
5316240,5317120," So, essentially."
5317120,5318080," If one of the functions."
5318080,5318800," Are not implemented."
5318800,5319600," They're going to have."
5319600,5320800," Implementation that says."
5320800,5321760," Not implemented."
5321760,5322240," And in fact."
5322240,5322720," Because of that."
5322720,5323360," I can just like."
5323360,5324400," Remove this entire thing."
5324400,5325920," Completely."
5325920,5327120," So, that's a very cool."
5327120,5328320," piece of code."
5328320,5329120," And as you can see."
5329120,5330000," It just compiled."
5330000,5331040," And loaded successfully."
5331040,5332560," I think."
5332560,5333440," But it didn't say."
5333440,5335120," Got instantiated."
5335120,5336000," Or anything like that."
5336000,5336960," Which is kind of weird."
5336960,5337920," So."
5337920,5340720," I'm not quite sure."
5340720,5342480," So, it loaded."
5342480,5346800," That is totally sus."
5346800,5347040," Right."
5347040,5348320," So, where is the console log?"
5348320,5350480," Yeah."
5350480,5351600," There is no console log."
5351600,5354560," So, it means it's broken."
5356240,5357360," Might be broken actually."
5357360,5360320," Hello."
5360320,5363280," So, yeah."
5363280,5364560," We probably need to do catch."
5364560,5365280," So."
5365280,5368320," What's the on error?"
5368320,5369680," What's the on error thingy."
5369680,5371280," For the promise."
5371280,5372080," Who remembers that?"
5372080,5373680," Promise."
5373680,5376000," JS promise."
5376000,5377280," On error."
5377280,5379120," How will you do that?"
5379120,5379600," And then."
5379600,5381120," It's catch."
5381120,5381360," Right."
5381360,5382560," But I want a confirmation."
5382560,5383120," Right."
5383120,5384240," Chat likes to debate me."
5385120,5386640," But I need some sort of a confirmation."
5386640,5387520," No."
5387520,5387600," No."
5387600,5387760," No."
5387760,5388320," I don't."
5388320,5388880," Like."
5388880,5390080," I don't trust you."
5390080,5390320," Like."
5390320,5392080," I don't freaking trust you."
5392080,5392320," No."
5392320,5393840," I need a confirmation."
5393840,5395360," So, it is catch."
5395360,5395760," Okay."
5395760,5396480," So, now."
5396480,5396800," Now."
5396800,5398560," I'm confident."
5398560,5399520," That it is like that."
5399520,5400800," So, it's a catch error."
5400800,5401120," Okay."
5403600,5405440," So, it's going to be catch."
5405440,5410000," And this is going to be an emacs."
5410000,5411600," Use dummy dum-dum."
5411600,5413200," All right."
5413200,5418000," And we can do console log error."
5418000,5420160," Emacs."
5420160,5421280," Please stop."
5421280,5421520," Like."
5421520,5422560," I beg you."
5422560,5424080," Don't do this kind of shit anymore."
5425680,5426240," All right."
5426240,5426560," So."
5426560,5438960," Dev tool hide the console log."
5438960,5440240," Ah."
5440240,5440960," Error only."
5440960,5442640," Did I press error only?"
5442640,5442880," Where?"
5442880,5446160," How did I?"
5447760,5449520," I must be accident."
5449520,5449840," Okay."
5449840,5452960," I accidentally pressed this kind of thing."
5452960,5453920," But anyway."
5453920,5454240," All right."
5454240,5455280," So, we have a module."
5455280,5456560," And we have an instance."
5456560,5458640," And here's the most important thing."
5458640,5461920," Do we have any exported functions?"
5461920,5463040," Okay."
5463040,5465600," So, this is the functions that we're importing."
5465600,5467520," This is the function that we want to have."
5467520,5470080," But do we export any functions?"
5470080,5470640," We don't."
5470640,5472400," And that's the problem."
5472400,5472720," Right."
5472720,5473440," That's the problem."
5473440,5476560," So, let me see."
5477760,5478720," The thing we have to do."
5478720,5483280," If we go to snake wasm main."
5483280,5486240," When we compile the entire thing."
5486240,5492080," You have to export specific function."
5492080,5492320," Right."
5492320,5493200," So, export."
5493200,5495680," So, let's go ahead and do that."
5495680,5498320," Let's go ahead and export main."
5498320,5500240," I think that's going to be interesting."
5500240,5503040," Let's literally export main."
5503040,5505040," And let's literally rebuild the entire thing."
5505040,5507040," Minus b."
5507040,5507440," Okay."
5507440,5507920," That's cool."
5507920,5509040," Right."
5509040,5510080," I'm going to refresh."
5510080,5514160," And we are online forwarding."
5514160,5514480," Oh."
5514480,5515440," Service worker."
5515440,5525440," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5525440,5529920," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5529920,5530720," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5530720,5531120," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5531120,5532320," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5532320,5533120," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5533120,5534320," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5534320,5536320," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5536320,5538320," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5538320,5538320," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5538320,5539320," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5539320,5540320," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5540320,5541320," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5541320,5542320," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5542320,5543320," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5543320,5545320," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5545320,5546320," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5546320,5547320," I still have a service worker from that stream."
5547320,5557320," We can try to call that function from JavaScript."
5557320,5559320," Who said we can't do that?"
5559320,5560920," Who fucking said we can't do that?"
5560920,5561640," We can't do that."
5561640,5562600," Right."
5562600,5570120," So it's going to be, I suppose, w-exports main, I suppose."
5570120,5570360," Right."
5570360,5571640," So we just call that."
5571640,5573320," Right."
5573320,5575000," And we're going to refresh this entire thing."
5575000,5577000," I can't read the property main."
5577000,5577560," God damn it."
5577560,5577800," Okay."
5577800,5580440," So I think it's instance."
5580440,5580920," Yeah."
5580920,5581480," Instance."
5581480,5586200," Fuck."
5586200,5587880," I fucked up."
5587880,5588760," I fucked up."
5588760,5591480," Because it calls all of that shit in the loop."
5591480,5595480," But it worked."
5595480,5597560," Just a second."
5597560,5598280," Just a second."
5598280,5599000," It worked."
5599000,5601640," It worked."
5601640,5603160," Okay."
5603160,5604840," So one of the things we can do."
5605640,5608680," So we can do window should close."
5608680,5609160," Right."
5609160,5610120," Window should close."
5610120,5615240," We can say return false."
5615240,5616520," Return true."
5616520,5619320," So that will immediately make it close the window."
5619320,5620760," Right."
5620760,5623560," So that will immediately make it close the window."
5623560,5625720," So let's try to open it."
5625720,5629560," And man, it's probably going to be fucking cached."
5630360,5630600," All right."
5630600,5631800," It's probably going to be fucking cached."
5631800,5633720," So it will load the previous version."
5633720,5635320," Oh my God."
5635320,5635640," Okay."
5635640,5639880," So I'm going to go ahead and maybe load the Raylib right now."
5639880,5641800," So maybe that will update the cache."
5641800,5643560," So then later I can open."
5643560,5644360," Okay."
5644360,5645240," There we go."
5645240,5645960," Look at that shit."
5645960,5648760," It called init window."
5648760,5651320," And then set target FPS."
5651320,5652600," And then close window."
5652600,5655240," Because should close window returned false."
5665480,5667000," I still didn't disable cache."
5667000,5668280," I think I disabled the cache."
5668280,5668920," Or did I?"
5668920,5669480," I don't remember."
5669480,5671480," Oh, disable cache."
5671480,5672760," Yeah."
5672760,5675800," So I did that for the previous stream."
5675800,5677400," Anyway."
5677400,5679080," So, yeah."
5679080,5681000," Look, all of that."
5681000,5681640," Chat, chat."
5681640,5682920," Let that sink in."
5682920,5684040," Or just let that sink in."
5684040,5689240," I don't understand why people are not excited about this kind of shit as I am."
5689800,5691880," All of that without using mscripten."
5691880,5695080," I guess..."
5695080,5701640," I think the culture in software development is so goddamn broken."
5701640,5703080," Nobody even understands."
5703080,5705960," Like, why the fuck am I excited about this kind of thing?"
5705960,5710600," Because mscripten just follow the instruction on mscripten and it just works."
5710600,5711560," What's the problem?"
5711560,5716440," The simplicity of the whole thing."
5716440,5717400," Like, look at that."
5717960,5720760," Like, this is a very small script."
5720760,5723720," The WASM module is so fucking small."
5723720,5724040," Yeah."
5724040,5728040," And also, so far, I didn't experience like severe problems."
5728040,5728280," Right."
5728280,5731560," So all the problems that I encounter are part of the implementation process."
5731560,5733480," And it's just like..."
5733480,5734440," Isn't simplicity..."
5734440,5738440," Isn't it exciting when you do a simple thing and it just works?"
5738440,5740120," It's just like..."
5740120,5741960," And you don't have to troubleshoot things."
5741960,5743640," You don't have to google things around."
5743640,5744280," And it's just like..."
5744280,5746440," I think that's so fucking cool."
5747640,5757080," Isn't it cool when you don't have problems?"
5757080,5758360," That's what I don't understand."
5758360,5761640," It's like, isn't it cool when you just don't have problems?"
5761640,5763400," When things just work?"
5763400,5765400," I think that's fucking cool."
5765400,5768520," That's fucking exciting because it's so fucking rare in 2024."
5768520,5771080," It's been rare in 2023."
5771080,5772680," It's even rare in 2024."
5772680,5774600," Right."
5774600,5783160," So the question is, how can we even organize the loop?"
5783160,5783320," Okay."
5783320,5786280," So in case of an init window, it is understandable."
5786280,5787560," We can do something."
5787560,5795800," So we can, for instance, set, you know, the size of the canvas to be that size and maybe the title of the window to be that."
5795800,5797480," But that is super easy to implement."
5797480,5801880," The difficult part is, how do you organize the loop?"
5801880,5803960," How do you organize the loop?"
5803960,5809480," Because the usual way you organize the loop, you organize the loop through requesting the frame."
5810360,5811000," You know what I mean?"
5811000,5813000," You organize it through requesting the frame."
5813000,5819160," And so that's a very interesting situation."
5819160,5821240," Right."
5821240,5823560," That's the very interesting situation."
5823560,5826600," So raylib.js."
5826600,5830680," So js request next frame."
5830680,5836920," Request next frame."
5836920,5841640," Request next animation frame."
5841640,5846280," So when you provide the callback, callback, as far as you know, accepts some stuff."
5846280,5847960," It accepts the timestamp."
5847960,5848280," All right."
5848280,5851080," So you can use that to calculate delta step and everything."
5851080,5851960," Right."
5851960,5852360," So, okay."
5852360,5855080," We successfully loaded the WASM module."
5855080,5855320," Right."
5855320,5856520," So successfully loaded it."
5856520,5859800," So we do window with the request animation frame."
5862840,5867400," And what I like to do, actually, I like to have two separate functions."
5867400,5867960," First one."
5867960,5869000," Right."
5869000,5871800," So function first, which accepts the timestamp."
5871800,5875400," And it kind of initializes the previous."
5875400,5876200," All right."
5876200,5878440," So previous is undefined for now."
5878440,5879960," Right."
5879960,5881400," So this is going to be the first frame."
5881400,5884280," And previous timestamp."
5884280,5888040," And we just schedule another animation frame."
5888040,5888280," Right."
5888280,5889640," So request animation frame."
5889640,5891480," Next."
5891480,5893480," And the next already."
5893480,5895480," Right."
5895480,5895960," Next."
5895960,5899800," Takes the current timestamp and computes the delta time."
5899800,5906280," Computes the delta time based on the current timestamp and the previous one."
5906280,5909160," And saves the current timestamp and previous one."
5909160,5911480," So, and then it requests the next one."
5911480,5911880," Right."
5911880,5914680," So essentially, on the first frame, we don't really know delta time."
5914680,5915800," It's probably going to be zero."
5915800,5916920," Right."
5916920,5919400," So, but the next one, we have something new."
5919400,5923880," And this is where you probably request the next frame."
5923880,5927320," This is probably where you request the next frame."
5927320,5936680," But the function itself wants to organize its own loop."
5937640,5938840," What I'm thinking."
5938840,5939880," What I'm thinking, Chad."
5939880,5941800," What if."
5941800,5944840," When you do window should close."
5944840,5946840," When you do window should close."
5946840,5950520," We request the next frame."
5950520,5956200," We request the next frame and block."
5956200,5958920," And block."
5960360,5964120," And only then, when the next frame has been requested."
5964120,5968120," We resume the computation."
5968120,5970680," We unblock window should close."
5970680,5974600," And allow this entire thing to continue until end drawing."
5974600,5977320," Right."
5977320,5979320," And then drawing does the rest of the thing."
5979320,5982840," So we have a lot of points in here to organize something."
5982840,5984520," Right."
5984520,5986680," We have a lot of points in here to organize something."
5986680,5988760," And I wonder what kind of stuff we can do in here."
5989400,5990200," Right."
5990200,5991880," So initially."
5991880,5992280," Okay."
5992280,5993400," So this is previous."
5993400,5995080," So this is previous."
5995080,5997960," Let's."
5997960,6000360," In the window should close."
6000360,6004040," Request the next animation frame."
6004040,6005960," Where we're going to take the timestamp."
6005960,6006280," All right."
6006280,6008440," So this is where we got the timestamp."
6008440,6011800," And obviously this thing is not going to block that easily."
6011800,6012040," Right."
6012040,6017400," It is not going to block that easily."
6019400,6022280," Does the request animation frame return some sort of a promise?"
6022280,6024600," Does it return some sort of a promise that we can use?"
6024600,6030200," Or can you promissify this thing?"
6030200,6033960," Can you promissify?"
6033960,6036600," Let's Google it up."
6036600,6037960," It's very interesting actually."
6037960,6041800," So JS request."
6041800,6047640," Request animation frame as promise."
6047640,6055160," Inside the promise."
6055160,6055480," Okay."
6055480,6057320," So let me see."
6057320,6058840," Maybe Google knows a little bit there."
6058840,6062280," So but I'm starting to feel that it might not be that easy how to use."
6063000,6063320," Okay."
6063320,6065400," So maybe this discussion is actually useful."
6065400,6070760," Okay."
6070760,6071320," Okay."
6071320,6072520," Request animation."
6072520,6073960," So okay."
6073960,6075240," There is a request ID."
6075240,6077160," Which is rather interesting."
6077160,6081400," It does return request ID."
6089640,6095160," So we have a lot of different points at which we can try to do something."
6095160,6096040," Right."
6096040,6098920," So maybe we can try to do that at begin drawing."
6098920,6102120," We can try to do that at begin drawing."
6102120,6107560," Interestingly."
6107560,6112280," What if we have two loops in parallel?"
6114440,6116280," What if we have two loops in parallel?"
6116280,6122760," So essentially one loop keeps scheduling itself."
6122760,6123160," Right."
6123160,6124360," And drawing things."
6124360,6127560," And this one keeps issuing commands."
6127560,6129080," Right."
6129080,6133720," It keeps issuing commands and adds them to some sort of a queue."
6133720,6140440," To some sort of a queue that is then rendered by the rest of the things."
6141240,6141480," Right."
6141480,6143640," But I feel like if you call main."
6143640,6143960," Right."
6143960,6144840," If you call main."
6144840,6148840," It is going to kind of block everything."
6148840,6151720," I wonder if you can."
6151720,6154280," Yo."
6154280,6156600," I have a really weird idea."
6159320,6163640," What if we run the entire game."
6163640,6166760," The entire game in a worker."
6166760,6169080," In a worker."
6169080,6173160," And every time you do begin draw clear background or something like that."
6173160,6177240," We issue a command and set it to the main thread."
6177240,6179400," That actually renders things."
6184840,6185560," You know what I mean?"
6185560,6191560," It feels a little bit complicated."
6191560,6195640," And I don't really know how to do that."
6195640,6196040," All right."
6196040,6197400," So it feels a little bit complicated."
6197400,6198760," And I don't know how to do that."
6198760,6202440," So we're probably not going to do that."
6202440,6206440," But the advantage of this approach, by the way."
6206440,6208040," The advantage of that approach is that."
6209400,6212360," We may have literally the same code."
6212360,6215480," In web and in native."
6215480,6217000," Right."
6217000,6220360," In web and in native."
6220360,6222200," So but anyway."
6222200,6224360," But anyway."
6224360,6227640," So we can go with the same approach as MScripten."
6227640,6228280," Right."
6228280,6234280," So an interesting thing is that MScripten doesn't even solve the problem that we're trying to solve."
6234280,6234680," Right."
6234680,6236200," Even with MScripten."
6236200,6239240," With all of its cost of edit complexity."
6239240,6243800," You still need to do that trick of set frame handler."
6243800,6246360," You still need to do that."
6246360,6248760," It's still a thing that you must do."
6248760,6249080," Right."
6249080,6251720," Set frame handler or something like that."
6251720,6255160," Or we can go even further."
6255160,6255880," In fact."
6255880,6257640," We can go even further."
6257640,6260440," We can actually export that function."
6260440,6262840," So we can say next frame."
6262840,6263720," Right."
6263720,6265080," So this is the next frame."
6265080,6267320," And in here."
6267320,6268360," In here."
6268360,6271080," When we do the next frame."
6271080,6272600," We just do it like that."
6272600,6279000," We just do it like that."
6279000,6281240," We just do it like that."
6281240,6282680," And to the theme."
6282680,6285400," So."
6287640,6293720," We do the next window and the close one."
6293720,6301320," So I suppose we still need to have this kind of thing."
6301320,6301720," Right."
6301720,6306200," So if defined platform web."
6306200,6309960," We're going to have our own entry points."
6309960,6310360," Right."
6310360,6310600," So."
6310600,6313000," Something like."
6313000,6317800," Let's do array lib frame."
6317800,6321640," Then array lib init."
6321640,6323240," Ray lib init."
6323240,6326520," You know."
6326520,6329720," Ray lib is actually kind of related to the library."
6329720,6331080," Let's call it game frame."
6332440,6333320," Game init."
6333320,6334360," Right."
6334360,6337400," And in init."
6337400,6338840," You would do all of these things."
6338840,6340200," Right."
6340200,6340600," In init."
6340600,6342200," You would do all of these things."
6342200,6343640," Maybe we can even do it like that."
6343640,6344360," Game init."
6344360,6345400," Right."
6345400,6348200," Game frame."
6348200,6350120," Game frame."
6352520,6354120," And game."
6354120,6360200," Actually."
6360200,6360760," Wait a second."
6360760,6361160," We can."
6361160,6361880," Yeah."
6361880,6364600," That's very interesting actually."
6364600,6368440," Game."
6368440,6370520," How can we call that?"
6370520,6370840," Game."
6370840,6373400," So close."
6373400,6374200," Right."
6374200,6374840," Game close."
6375960,6376440," And."
6376440,6378680," Game close."
6378680,6385240," And if."
6385240,6391000," So."
6391000,6392680," Essentially."
6392680,6394360," We're just expert in all of these things."
6394360,6395720," Game over."
6395720,6395960," Okay."
6395960,6397640," Chat suggests game over."
6397640,6402920," Right."
6402920,6405000," So these are callbacks that are called."
6405560,6407160," By the runtime."
6407160,6409080," By the JavaScript runtime."
6409080,6412040," So that's the callbacks."
6412040,6413320," Okay."
6413320,6414840," So interestingly."
6414840,6416280," If I try to do."
6416280,6416600," Make."
6416600,6418360," Game native."
6418360,6418840," Right."
6418840,6419400," So I think."
6419400,6421000," Game native."
6421000,6422280," It's compilable."
6422280,6422440," Right."
6422440,6423880," So if you take a look at the game native."
6423880,6424680," Right."
6424680,6425640," So it's a native game."
6425640,6427240," Here is the native game."
6427240,6428760," Here's the native game."
6428760,6430200," And."
6430200,6432280," When we're compiling the."
6432280,6433480," Wasm one."
6433480,6435080," We probably have to also specify."
6435080,6436440," Platform web."
6436440,6437400," Right."
6437400,6438600," So we're doing platform web."
6438600,6439480," And."
6439480,6440600," When we're exporting."
6440600,6442200," We're not exporting main anymore."
6442200,6442440," Right."
6442440,6443400," So we don't care about main."
6443400,6444120," We do game."
6444120,6445800," You know."
6445800,6446440," In it."
6446440,6446920," Right."
6446920,6447160," So."
6447160,6450040," And we need to export all of these functions in here."
6450040,6451560," Game frame."
6451560,6453240," Frame."
6453240,6453880," Game."
6453880,6455720," Over."
6455720,6457240," Game over."
6457240,6458040," There we go."
6458040,6458760," So."
6458760,6460200," And I can rebuild everything."
6460200,6461480," Right."
6461480,6463000," And it also rebuild the wasm."
6463000,6463320," So."
6463320,6465720," If we take a look at the wasm to what."
6465720,6467080," Wasn't what."
6467080,6469320," So."
6469320,6470920," What we are exporting."
6470920,6472280," We're exporting things like."
6472280,6473800," Game init."
6473800,6474040," So."
6474040,6475400," Here is the game init."
6475400,6475720," So."
6475720,6476840," The game over."
6476840,6477080," Right."
6477080,6479000," And it should be also game frame somewhere."
6479000,6480760," Where's the game frame."
6480760,6481800," And here is the game frame."
6481800,6482760," So."
6482760,6483400," Now."
6483400,6483640," Right."
6483640,6485080," If we want to run this entire thing."
6485080,6485880," We should not run."
6485880,6487400," Game main."
6487400,6487800," Right."
6487800,6489080," The first thing we have to run."
6489080,6490440," Is."
6490440,6493640," Game init."
6493640,6493800," So."
6493800,6494920," That's the first thing we do."
6494920,6496680," Then."
6496680,6498360," We do."
6498360,6499640," Request animation frame."
6499640,6500360," And stuff like that."
6500360,6500840," And we do."
6500840,6502120," Instance."
6502120,6504040," Instance."
6504040,6506200," Exports."
6506200,6509800," Game frame."
6509800,6511320," Game frame."
6512360,6512840," And."
6512840,6513640," What's interesting is that."
6513640,6514840," We never call."
6514840,6516120," Game over."
6516120,6516760," Because."
6516760,6518520," We don't really catch that."
6518520,6518920," Yet."
6518920,6520440," But maybe we will in the future."
6520440,6522120," Maybe we will in the future."
6522120,6523480," It doesn't really matter that much."
6523480,6525080," Anyways."
6525080,6525640," So."
6525640,6526840," What do we want to do?"
6526840,6529480," We want to implement all of the functions in here."
6529480,6529720," Right."
6529720,6531160," We want to implement all of the functions."
6531160,6531320," So."
6531320,6532040," We can say that."
6532040,6534760," Window should never close."
6534760,6535000," Right."
6535000,6535160," So."
6535160,6536280," It's always going to be false."
6536280,6538520," When we do init window."
6538520,6539400," Right."
6539400,6540520," When we do init window."
6540520,6541400," What do we do?"
6541400,6541720," Chat."
6542360,6544920," Here we have width and height."
6544920,6545880," So."
6545880,6547560," Here we have width and height."
6547560,6548760," I suppose."
6548760,6549400," What we have to do."
6549400,6551080," We have to take the canvas."
6551080,6552680," We have to take the canvas."
6552680,6552840," And."
6552840,6556040," Set its width and height to that."
6556040,6556440," Right."
6556440,6556680," So."
6556680,6557560," That's what we have to do."
6557560,6558840," So."
6558840,6559400," By the way."
6559400,6560840," Let me actually put true in here."
6560840,6563240," Just in case it go into the loop."
6564200,6564520," So."
6564520,6566680," First of all."
6566680,6568360," We need to get the canvas."
6568360,6568520," So."
6568520,6569640," This is going to be canvas."
6569640,6571880," It's undefined for now."
6571880,6574200," Once the entire thing initialized."
6574200,6574360," Right."
6574360,6575640," Once the entire thing initialized."
6575640,6576680," We need to do canvas."
6576680,6578600," Document."
6578600,6580120," Get."
6580120,6581400," Element."
6581400,6583400," Element by id."
6583400,6585080," And the id is."
6585080,6587720," Game html."
6587720,6588840," Game html."
6588840,6589880," And it's game."
6589880,6590760," It's literally game."
6590760,6592360," So that's what we have in here."
6592360,6594120," And we also need to have a context."
6594120,6594920," So it's a canvas."
6594920,6596520," Get."
6596520,6597320," How do you do that?"
6597320,6598920," HTML5 canvas example."
6598920,6599320," Show me."
6599320,6599640," Please."
6599640,6604680," All right."
6604680,6605480," So."
6605480,6607080," Let me see."
6607080,6611480," Get context."
6611480,6612200," Okay."
6612200,6613000," Get context."
6613000,6614840," And the context is going to be 2D."
6614840,6620120," So that actually makes it impossible to use 3D capabilities of Raylib."
6620120,6623960," But you can actually use WebGL in the future and implement them."
6623960,6626200," You can actually then implement them."
6626200,6628760," So it's not that big of a deal in my opinion."
6628760,6629720," It's not that big of a deal."
6629720,6631240," So you have a context."
6631240,6634040," And I suppose we can put the context here as well."
6634040,6634680," In fact."
6634680,6637240," I would actually only keep the context."
6637240,6639480," Because you can get the canvas from the context."
6639480,6640680," Right."
6640680,6641960," So I can do something like this."
6641960,6644840," And the only thing we need in here is the context."
6644840,6646600," So ctx canvas."
6646600,6649400," Canvas width equal to width."
6649400,6651640," And then height equal to height."
6652680,6655640," And js set title."
6655640,6658120," Right."
6658120,6659560," Just set title."
6659560,6660200," So let's see."
6660200,6663880," How did I make a change the web page title?"
6663880,6665160," Okay."
6668840,6669400," document title."
6669400,6669880," Document title."
6669880,6677880," This is a problem, by the way."
6677880,6679640," This is a problem."
6679640,6680760," You know why?"
6680760,6683400," Because title is a pointer."
6683400,6686280," It is literally a pointer."
6686280,6688760," You need to extract that from the memory."
6688760,6690760," You need to extract that from the memory."
6690760,6692920," So that means we have to..."
6692920,6693480," Yeah, there we go."
6693480,6694520," I already have that, actually."
6696840,6697320," Okay."
6697320,6703720," So in a snake, I implemented things like string lang sister to pointer and stuff like that"
6703720,6705560," to manipulate the memory and everything."
6705560,6706440," Right."
6706440,6709080," So you can extract c strings from the memory."
6709080,6710120," So I already have that."
6710120,6711880," So this is going to be actually very useful."
6711880,6713480," All right."
6713480,6715080," So let me actually put that in here."
6715080,6717320," Cster len."
6717320,6719720," And the way you work that, you get..."
6719720,6720680," Okay."
6720680,6721960," Sister by pointer."
6721960,6724360," Oh, it automatically decodes the shit."
6724360,6724920," Okay."
6724920,6726360," So we definitely need that."
6726360,6732040," So the way you use that, you just give it the memory buffer."
6732040,6732360," Yeah."
6732360,6734360," That's how you use this shit."
6734360,6741080," So essentially, you extract the memory buffer out of the WASM module."
6741080,6745080," So which means that we need to have a WASM module available in there."
6745080,6745320," Right."
6745320,6746680," So let me see."
6746680,6749400," Maybe I can do something like WASM undefined."
6749400,6753720," And then it means in here, I can do WASM doubling."
6754600,6756760," So then we can actually have an access to all of that."
6756760,6759080," So we take WASM instance export."
6759080,6759960," We take the memory."
6759960,6761160," We take the buffer."
6761160,6764760," And we take the title by that thing."
6764760,6766200," So this is the text."
6766200,6770440," And we can right away assign document title like that."
6770440,6770680," Right."
6770680,6774360," So the main problem with like WebAssembly is that you can't really work with..."
6774360,6776760," Right."
6776760,6778520," You can't really work with strings directly."
6778520,6780760," You kind of need to extract them from the memory."
6780760,6781000," Right."
6781000,6782840," So you kind of need to extract them from the memory."
6782840,6786840," So let me..."
6786840,6787640," Let me see."
6787640,6791560," So I just want to test how it is going to work."
6791560,6792760," I have a lot of shit open."
6792760,6794440," So let's actually close all of that stuff."
6794440,6796680," Let's actually close all of that stuff."
6796680,6798840," And I'm about to refresh this entire thing."
6798840,6799960," Text pointer is not defined."
6799960,6800360," Okay."
6800360,6801640," So where did that happen?"
6801640,6803480," 65."
6803480,6805720," Are you fucking serious?"
6805720,6808360," Oh, well, I mean, that makes sense."
6808360,6810600," Text PTR."
6810600,6811000," Oh, yeah."
6811000,6813640," So it's a title."
6813640,6814600," So this is a title."
6814600,6816840," We might as well maybe call title PTR."
6816840,6818680," Just for the convenience."
6818680,6820600," All right."
6820600,6821800," So what do we have in here?"
6821800,6825160," So that kind of..."
6825160,6827240," Why do you keep working?"
6827240,6827480," Okay."
6830680,6831640," Let's kill this shit."
6831640,6835080," Window should close."
6835080,6837720," Where is the window should close?"
6837720,6838520," I said true."
6838520,6840040," Ah!"
6840040,6844120," So, yeah, we never close this thing anymore."
6844120,6844360," Yeah."
6844360,6846280," So we never call this thing anymore."
6846280,6847320," So that's totally fine."
6847320,6848280," All right."
6848280,6848600," All right."
6848600,6849640," That makes sense."
6849640,6851400," So I suppose what we want to do,"
6851400,6853720," we want to actually just like do something like this."
6853720,6854040," All right."
6854040,6857800," So game init and maybe game over."
6857800,6859000," Just call these two things."
6860520,6860760," Right."
6860760,6862680," And just in case, I'm going to rebuild everything."
6862680,6865880," Localhost 6969."
6865880,6869960," So 6969."
6869960,6873960," Yeah."
6873960,6874360," There we go."
6874360,6875640," So you can set..."
6875640,6878680," So did it work?"
6878680,6879480," I think it worked."
6880920,6881240," Yeah."
6881240,6885160," The width and height is set."
6885160,6887160," The width and height is set."
6887160,6891880," So the game HTML."
6891880,6895240," So this was hello, Raylib, by the way."
6895240,6897000," The title was hello, Raylib."
6897000,6899480," But now it is hello from WebAssembly."
6901480,6903320," And if we take a look at the game.c."
6903320,6908600," So yeah, we implemented init window."
6908600,6911240," We implemented init window."
6911240,6915160," So I'm just saying, just saying."
6915160,6917000," Okay."
6917000,6919800," So the next thing we need to do."
6919800,6920920," So what's going to be the next thing?"
6922360,6923720," Game.c."
6923720,6926520," Set target FPS."
6926520,6929080," I think we can just ignore it."
6929080,6929720," All right."
6929720,6931800," So I think we can just ignore it."
6931800,6935720," So we can say something like set target FPS."
6937880,6942200," So FPS console log."
6942200,6947640," The game wants to run at..."
6947640,6950440," Let's put it like this maybe."
6950440,6952360," Is this how we do that?"
6952360,6952920," FPS."
6952920,6954440," At FPS."
6954440,6957320," But in web,"
6957320,6962600," we gonna just ignore it."
6962600,6965640," Right."
6965640,6967080," So let me see."
6967080,6968360," Let me see if it's going to do."
6968360,6972120," An expected identifier."
6972120,6976840," So is this how we do that?"
6976840,6980280," Set target FPS."
6980280,6982520," Wait, what?"
6982520,6987000," Ah, Jesus."
6987000,6988680," So dumb."
6988680,6992040," Yeah, the game wants to run at..."
6995640,7001960," At 60 FPS, but in web, we're gonna just ignore it."
7001960,7002200," Okay."
7002200,7003560," So then it tries to close the window."
7003560,7004200," So that's fine."
7004200,7006200," All right."
7006200,7009160," So now let's do the rest of the things."
7009160,7010440," Let's do the rest of the things."
7010440,7011960," So we're not going to request the next frame."
7011960,7013240," We're going to only do one frame."
7013240,7015000," Yeah, begin drawing."
7015000,7016760," So when we begin drawing,"
7016760,7019000," I don't think we can do anything."
7019000,7022040," At least right now, we don't really need to do anything."
7023240,7026280," So, and when we end drawing, we're also not going to do anything."
7026280,7027560," End drawing."
7027560,7029240," We also don't do anything."
7029240,7030280," Right."
7030280,7031400," So they are implemented."
7031400,7032760," So, of course, comma."
7032760,7034280," Okay."
7034280,7035720," So clear background."
7035720,7037720," The only thing we need in here is a clear background."
7037720,7040040," Clear background."
7041080,7042600," And that's the interesting part."
7042600,7046040," That's now the interesting part, actually."
7046040,7049240," Because we need to set the current color."
7049240,7055480," So it's going to be ctx fill style, I suppose."
7055480,7058840," But we need to use the browser styles."
7058840,7061720," And I think we in snake already have that."
7061720,7064520," So yeah, color hex."
7064520,7069640," Yeah, I already have a code that extracts the components out of the integer"
7069640,7072920," and turns them into the browser hex code."
7072920,7074840," So you can use that in the freaking browser."
7074840,7077480," So anyway, web."
7077480,7078200," Am I right?"
7078200,7078440," Web."
7078440,7081000," So I already have that."
7081000,7084200," So that means color hex."
7084200,7087000," And this is the color."
7087000,7088040," Right."
7088040,7089000," I just put it in here."
7089000,7092360," So clear."
7092360,7093880," I think it's just a clear rect."
7093880,7097080," Or maybe we can say fill rect."
7097080,7104520," HTML5 canvas clear with color."
7104520,7106680," I don't remember how we do that."
7106680,7113960," This is kind of complicated, but it looks amazing."
7116200,7119480," And then those people have no problems with mscripten."
7119480,7120760," Have you seen mscripten?"
7120760,7123720," Have you seen mscripten?"
7123720,7127160," Okay, so you're probably trolling me."
7127160,7128200," Okay, I'm not going to say anything."
7128200,7130440," All right."
7130440,7133960," So fill style."
7133960,7136840," So you probably have to do the whole thing in here."
7136840,7138440," Okay, so that's understandable."
7138440,7139960," So fill style, fill rect."
7139960,7142920," We can do 00ctx canvas."
7144200,7150520," And we just do width, width, ctx, canvas."
7150520,7159480," All right, all right, all right."
7159480,7160840," Okay."
7160840,7162440," So that's kind of cool."
7162440,7165480," But it didn't do shit."
7165480,7168920," Because I think what we have to do..."
7170760,7173000," Yeah, so clear, clear rect."
7173000,7176040," And then I suppose we have to do the fill."
7176040,7177320," Right."
7177320,7179720," So we have to do the fill."
7179720,7181960," ctx fill."
7186520,7187400," No, it didn't work."
7187400,7192200," But why?"
7192200,7194520," Why it didn't work?"
7194520,7196840," We can try to do console.log."
7196840,7200440," So is it just rect?"
7200440,7201560," Maybe it just has to be rect."
7201560,7203400," Maybe that thing was right."
7203400,7205160," No, it wasn't."
7205160,7206840," And there's no also errors."
7206840,7209320," ctx canvas is wrong."
7209320,7209720," Really?"
7211480,7212200," No, it is not."
7212200,7218920," So it is not wrong."
7218920,7224600," So maybe I can find something in snake."
7224600,7226760," Fill rect."
7226760,7228200," So fill style, fill rect."
7228200,7231160," So that's understandable."
7231160,7232440," That's basically what was in here."
7232440,7237080," And then where do we call this entire thing?"
7238760,7239320," Well, yeah."
7239320,7240760," That's basically it, isn't it?"
7240760,7242440," That's basically it."
7242440,7244520," So..."
7244520,7246840," GameInit."
7246840,7247880," RequestAnimation."
7247880,7248520," InLoop."
7248520,7252840," GameRender."
7252840,7254120," So we just render the game."
7254120,7258440," So yeah, I didn't see any problem."
7258440,7261000," Frame."
7261000,7262200," Fill."
7262200,7264040," Rect."
7264040,7266520," So fill style, fill rect."
7266520,7267320," Yeah, that should be."
7267320,7275880," So this is a fill rect."
7275880,7288280," What am I doing wrong?"
7288280,7290120," What am I doing wrong?"
7290120,7293240," So I initialize this thing correctly."
7293240,7294520," It's something super dumb."
7295240,7302680," What's funny is that every time I'm working with the HTML canvas, I cannot get it to render anything"
7302680,7304200," first try."
7304200,7307880," And I spent some time just figuring out what is wrong."
7307880,7311240," And I keep forgetting what exactly did I do."
7311240,7315400," That's the most annoying part of this canvas."
7315400,7318760," It's just like it never really works for me first try."
7318760,7320840," I just have to mess with it a little bit."
7320840,7323880," And then I don't remember what exactly did I do."
7323880,7326520," It's just like it wants something fucking specific."
7326520,7328520," It wants something specific."
7328520,7332200," And I cannot figure out for my life what exactly does it want."
7333640,7339080," So the loop is disabled, but we are rendering at least one frame."
7339080,7339320," Right."
7339320,7340600," So I see what you mean."
7340600,7341880," I see what you mean."
7341880,7343960," But we are rendering at least one frame."
7343960,7345240," So it should not be a thing."
7345240,7346840," It should not be a problem."
7346840,7350360," So it's just so fucking annoying."
7350360,7352920," It's just like, what do you have to do in here?"
7354040,7357800," Okay, so yeah, it doesn't do anything."
7357800,7360760," So ctx fill rect."
7360760,7363080," Show me example."
7363080,7363400," Right."
7363400,7365400," So html5"
7365400,7370920," canvas rectangle."
7370920,7372120," Right."
7372120,7372840," I want to see that."
7372840,7376120," You want to see that."
7376120,7376840," Just an example."
7376840,7378360," Just a full example that works."
7378360,7380040," Begin path."
7380040,7380920," So is it?"
7380920,7383480," Fill rectangle, please."
7383480,7384040," No, no, no."
7384040,7384280," Fill."
7384280,7384600," Fill."
7384600,7387320," So which time of a canvas."
7387320,7389560," Fill rect."
7389560,7391080," Example."
7391080,7391480," Right."
7391480,7392840," Full example."
7392840,7395000," All of this stroke bullshit."
7395000,7396280," Finish stroke bullshit."
7396280,7397160," Like everything."
7397160,7399560," What exactly do you have to perform to make it work?"
7399560,7401320," Full example, please."
7401320,7401880," Full example."
7401880,7402120," Okay."
7402120,7403000," Okay."
7403000,7403240," Okay."
7403240,7403320," Okay."
7403320,7403560," Okay."
7403560,7405320," So fill style."
7405320,7406440," All right."
7406440,7408120," So maybe this is something with the color."
7408120,7409880," I don't really know."
7409880,7412200," Right."
7412200,7415640," So let's put the red in here and then we fill right."
7415640,7418760," I can even hard code all of these things."
7418760,7422040," So I know what exactly going on."
7422040,7422440," Right."
7422440,7424600," So we get element by ID."
7424600,7424840," Right."
7424840,7427880," So here's the element by ID being gotten."
7427880,7428920," Right."
7428920,7431400," So, and this is ID game."
7431400,7433240," Then I do canvas get context."
7433240,7434680," We get the context."
7434680,7435080," Okay."
7435080,7436120," We assign it."
7436120,7437240," We initialize everything."
7438120,7439240," We call the next frame."
7439240,7440760," Everything's fine."
7440760,7443000," Everything's fine."
7443000,7445720," So then we do fill style and it should just work."
7445720,7446840," Right."
7446840,7449480," I rebuild for some reason, but I didn't think it is necessary."
7449480,7451240," It works."
7451240,7451560," Okay."
7451560,7453720," So that is pretty cool."
7453720,7455000," But that is pretty epic."
7455000,7457240," What about CTX canvas width?"
7457240,7458520," Right."
7458520,7461080," CTX canvas height."
7461080,7462280," Right."
7462280,7463480," CTX canvas height."
7463480,7464840," If I refresh it now."
7464840,7466360," Right."
7466360,7467640," It seems to be working."
7467640,7469800," So maybe there's something with the color."
7469800,7471800," Maybe I'm using just a bad color."
7471800,7472040," Yeah."
7472040,7473560," I was just using that color."
7473560,7474520," That's fine."
7474520,7477160," So let's take a look at what is this freaking color."
7477160,7479080," Fill style."
7479080,7481480," Fill style."
7481480,7483400," And right."
7483400,7484600," So let me see."
7484600,7486360," So that's a weird color."
7486360,7486920," Not gonna lie."
7486920,7489960," But another weird thing in here is the alpha."
7489960,7490280," Right."
7490280,7492120," Why did you choose such an alpha?"
7492760,7497720," So this is because we actually take the alpha into account."
7497720,7500040," We actually take the alpha into account."
7500040,7501640," And the alpha in here is like that."
7501640,7504600," So maybe there is something."
7504600,7506520," So if it's red."
7506520,7508360," What if I."
7508360,7509400," Okay."
7509400,7511640," It could be this."
7511640,7514120," Not really."
7514120,7516040," Okay."
7516040,7517320," It was not really that."
7520600,7522440," Why is this such a."
7522440,7523880," Okay."
7523880,7526200," So there's something with color conversion."
7526200,7527400," At least we know that."
7527400,7528280," Which is already good."
7528280,7529720," So."
7529720,7531080," Also."
7531080,7533080," Const hex."
7533080,7533880," Right."
7533880,7534760," So color hex."
7537800,7538760," And we can do."
7538760,7538760," And we can do."
7538760,7538760," And we can do."
7538760,7538760," And we can do."
7538760,7538760," And we can do."
7538760,7538760," And we can do."
7538760,7538840," And we can do."
7538840,7538840," And we can do."
7538840,7538840," And we can do."
7538840,7538840," And we can do."
7538840,7538840," And we can do."
7538840,7538840," And we can do."
7538840,7538840," And we can do."
7538840,7538840," And we can do."
7538840,7539880," And we can do."
7539880,7539880," And we can do."
7539880,7540840," And we can do."
7540840,7540840," And we can do."
7540840,7541880," And we can do."
7541880,7542840," And we can do."
7542840,7543880," And we can do."
7543880,7544840," All right."
7544840,7545000," All right."
7545000,7545240," All right."
7545240,7549880," That is bizarre."
7549880,7550840," That is bizarre."
7550840,7551840," So."
7551840,7551840," So."
7551840,7552840," Raylib."
7552840,7553880," Where are you?"
7553880,7554840," Where are you?"
7554840,7554840," Raylib."
7554840,7555720," Motherflipper."
7555720,7558440," Now."
7558440,7559800," If I take a look."
7559800,7560680," At the Raylib."
7560680,7561320," In here."
7561320,7563240," So."
7563240,7563720," Color."
7563720,7565560," Specifically red."
7565560,7567880," Define red."
7567880,7572120," Okay."
7572120,7579000," So."
7579000,7580200," Does this thing."
7580200,7581480," Fit."
7581480,7582680," How do you pass."
7582680,7583800," Structures in."
7585720,7592440," Let's take a look."
7592440,7592840," At maybe."
7592840,7593880," The way."
7593880,7594440," We pass."
7594440,7595000," Structures."
7595000,7595720," Maybe it passes."
7595720,7596360," The structures."
7596360,7597160," Through the pointer."
7597160,7600040," In that case."
7600040,7601000," It's kind of sus."
7601000,7601560," Right."
7601560,7602200," In that case."
7602200,7602920," It's kind of sus."
7602920,7603880," And I don't really know."
7603880,7604360," How exactly."
7604360,7605320," We're going to do all that."
7605320,7605480," But."
7605480,7607640," We can try to do that."
7607640,7608200," Nonetheless."
7608200,7610120," So."
7610120,7610680," Let me take a look."
7610680,7611720," Wasm to what?"
7611720,7613480," Wasm to what?"
7613480,7614920," Clear."
7614920,7615320," Color."
7615320,7616440," Clear background."
7616440,7617400," How do you call this thing?"
7617400,7619880," Local set."
7619880,7624120," Local get nine."
7624120,7625560," It doesn't really explain."
7625560,7626200," Me much."
7626200,7629800," Doesn't really explain."
7629800,7630520," Me much."
7630520,7631480," Let me see."
7631480,7632840," Let me see."
7632840,7633400," Let me see."
7633400,7635800," If I do."
7635800,7638600," Where is the JavaScript?"
7638600,7638760," Okay."
7638760,7639960," So here is the JavaScript."
7642440,7644680," I'm going to just remove implementation."
7644680,7646760," I'm going to just remove implementation."
7646760,7651400," And I want to see what arguments do we get from this function at all."
7653400,7654600," So something with token."
7654600,7654680," So something with token."
7654680,7656280," JavaScript."
7656280,7657480," Where is the JavaScript?"
7657480,7661800," Commented out too much."
7661800,7662200," I guess."
7662200,7662600," Yeah."
7662600,7667240," So this is what we got."
7667240,7669400," This is the thing."
7669400,7670760," This is the thing."
7670760,7673080," And if I do hex."
7674520,7675800," It doesn't look like a hex."
7675800,7677000," So that's kind of the problem."
7677000,7682760," So I suppose this is a pointer in the memory."
7682760,7684440," It must be a pointer in the memory."
7684440,7685160," So okay."
7685160,7689480," Let's do the following trick."
7689480,7691560," So let's just assume that it's a pointer in the memory."
7691560,7698600," So suppose the call convention is that the structures are in the memory."
7698600,7700440," So we take the buffer."
7700440,7700680," Right."
7700680,7701480," We take the buffer."
7701480,7708440," And inside of the buffer we can try to locate something."
7708440,7709400," So the way we work."
7709400,7711720," We just take this memory."
7711720,7712040," All right."
7712040,7713000," We take this memory."
7713000,7719480," So we also need to turn it into like a view of that thing."
7719480,7720920," Yeah."
7720920,7721720," So essentially."
7721720,7723640," We take the buffer."
7723640,7725720," Like buffer of the memory."
7725720,7728440," And we take a view of that buffer in here."
7728440,7729160," Right."
7729160,7730280," We take a view on it."
7730280,7732360," So we can just use the color ptr."
7732360,7734280," And we can take four of these bytes."
7734280,7735480," Right."
7735480,7739560," And then we can try to maybe print this entire thing."
7739560,7744040," To see if it contains what I expect it will contain."
7744040,7746360," So clear background and expected identifier."
7746360,7752440," So it's just buffer."
7752440,7759320," 55 comma."
7759320,7759560," Okay."
7759560,7761720," Okay."
7764200,7765560," Does it look familiar?"
7765560,7766440," Does it look familiar?"
7766440,7776680," 2, 3, 0, 41, 55, 255."
7776680,7780840," 230, 41, 55, 255."
7780840,7785240," So it was in a memory."
7785240,7787080," So it's literally located in the memory."
7787080,7788120," Right."
7788120,7789240," Okay."
7789240,7791480," So I guess we can work with that."
7791480,7792680," I guess we can work with that."
7793400,7797560," So the only thing in here is that we'll need to..."
7797560,7802200," We'll probably need to have this as a separate function."
7802200,7803560," All right."
7803560,7804280," Function."
7804280,7808280," How to say that?"
7808280,7810920," Color hex."
7810920,7813960," Unpacked."
7813960,7815080," All right."
7815080,7817400," And in here we're going to just accept RGBA."
7818600,7821880," And we can just try to do the following thing."
7821880,7824200," All right."
7824200,7828760," We're going to reassign RGBA like so."
7828760,7833720," So it's going to be RGBA."
7833720,7837080," So we're assigned them and we just return them like that."
7837080,7841800," So then we can do color hex unpacked."
7843320,7846200," So can I, by the way, do shit like this?"
7846200,7849000," Is that something I can do in JavaScript?"
7849000,7849800," All right."
7849800,7854760," So then I can do color hex unpacked."
7854760,7856680," RGBA."
7856680,7858920," RGBA."
7860120,7862040," And let me let me see."
7862040,7871320," Okay."
7871320,7871640," Good."
7871640,7877400," So now we're going to do something like this."
7877400,7886280," Okay."
7886280,7887240," Boom."
7887240,7889880," Easy peasy lemon squeezy."
7889880,7891800," Easy peasy lemon squeezy."
7891800,7896280," Extracted mother flipping color from the memory."
7896280,7898200," From the memory."
7898200,7900760," Absolutely freaking epic."
7900760,7902680," So, okay."
7902680,7904200," That's pretty cool and all."
7904200,7906680," But this is kind of boring, right?"
7906680,7909560," So what's so special about this piece of Shaisung?"
7909560,7913800," What is so special about this piece of Shaisung?"
7913800,7916840," Let's actually implement something more substantial, right?"
7916840,7918360," Let's implement something more substantial."
7918360,7924520," You know, the classical, you know, moving bouncing off of the edges,"
7924520,7926280," triangle, rectangle, whatever."
7926280,7927560," Maybe even circle, right?"
7927560,7930760," So let's actually do circle because it's easier because I can work with..."
7930760,7935960," I don't have to think too much about edges, I suppose."
7935960,7937400," But maybe it doesn't really matter."
7937400,7938360," Okay."
7938360,7940120," So we're going to introduce position."
7940120,7941320," So vector2 position."
7941320,7945720," Position and position is going to be, let's say, at the center."
7945720,7949400," Though one of the things, one of the cool things we can do."
7950280,7955720," We can essentially, when we initialize this entire thing, we can get..."
7955720,7960600," So screen width."
7960600,7964280," We can get screen width, which is going to be an integer, right?"
7964280,7967000," So it's going to be W and H."
7967000,7970840," So we also have to implement this entire thing, right?"
7970840,7977400," And then we can initialize position half of that, and Y is going to be half of that."
7977400,7979080," So that means we'll need to implement this thing."
7979080,7981000," So we kind of initialize this entire thing."
7981000,7981880," Right."
7981880,7986760," And then we can do, you know, ball radius."
7987320,7989560," So this one could be ball position."
7989560,7993400," And this is also ball position."
7994920,8007720," So then we can have ball velocity, which is going to be, let's say, 100 and 100."
8007720,8008920," So 100 and 100."
8008920,8014280," Afterwards, after we initialized everything and stuff like that,"
8014840,8023240," we can do get frame time, then vector to scale."
8023240,8026360," We're scaling the velocity of this entire thing."
8026360,8028120," We're scaling the velocity."
8028120,8032520," And then we do vector to add to the ball position."
8032520,8034840," And we just reassign all of that to the ball position."
8034840,8035800," So we've got this thing."
8035800,8038280," Right."
8038280,8039000," So that's pretty cool."
8039000,8043240," So that will probably mean that we need to have Ray Math, which is fine."
8043240,8044040," We can have that."
8044040,8047720," So and afterwards, we need to draw the circle."
8047720,8047880," Right."
8047880,8049240," So how can we draw the circle?"
8049240,8050680," Draw circle."
8050680,8052280," Maybe V."
8052280,8053560," Do you have draw circle V?"
8053560,8057320," Draw circle V."
8057320,8058200," Right."
8058200,8060520," So we have to provide the center, which probably means that,"
8060520,8063960," yeah, you will have to read it from memory."
8063960,8065960," But we already know how to read structures from memory."
8065960,8066760," So it doesn't really matter."
8066760,8068120," Okay."
8068120,8071000," Oh, this one is going to be kind of,"
8071880,8074200," kind of sucky wacky, but that's fine."
8074200,8078360," So this is the ball position, ball position."
8078360,8082680," Then the radius, ball radius, radius,"
8082680,8086920," which is going to be like, say, 100."
8086920,8089880," And the color is going to be also red."
8089880,8097400," In terms of the clear background, I think we should just do something like get color."
8098760,8100680," Maybe, maybe I want to do something like this."
8100680,8104360," So FF, 80, 80, 80, because it's easier."
8104360,8106120," It's just easier."
8106120,8109000," Though, yeah, this one is not going to work, right?"
8109000,8110760," So this one is definitely not going to work."
8110760,8115080," So it's better to maybe do something like this."
8115880,8116440," All right."
8116440,8119480," So 20, 20, 20, 255, right?"
8119480,8120520," So maybe that will work."
8120520,8122280," Maybe we can also make it clitoral."
8122280,8124280," Okay."
8124280,8128040," So we draw on the ball and that's it, basically, right?"
8128040,8130280," So that's basically it."
8134280,8140360," So let's try to compile the native game and see if it's going to work."
8140360,8141160," Okay."
8141160,8142360," It compiles first try."
8142360,8145080," That is sus."
8145080,8147560," All right."
8147560,8149720," So, oh, okay."
8149720,8153720," Yeah, that seems to be working."
8153720,8154440," So that's cool."
8154440,8156360," So this is the native one, right?"
8156360,8157960," So this was the native one."
8158680,8161800," Now let's try to compile the web one."
8161800,8165720," Web one doesn't, it wants to have math."
8165720,8166120," Okay."
8166120,8169240," So that one kind of sucks."
8169240,8170120," Not going to lie."
8170120,8171000," It kind of sucks."
8171000,8171560," Not going to lie."
8171560,8173400," So we also need to have math."
8173400,8175960," Can we, can we just not?"
8175960,8179320," Yeah."
8179320,8180840," Okay."
8180840,8183640," So it complains about undeclared shit, right?"
8183640,8185000," It complains about undeclared shit."
8185000,8186520," We can declare it ourselves."
8186520,8186760," Okay."
8186760,8187560," Sure."
8187560,8191480," So float, floor, float, right?"
8191480,8193080," So what else do we have?"
8193080,8196760," Fubs, anything else?"
8196760,8197560," What else do we want?"
8197560,8207160," Max, max, and incompatible declaration, float."
8207160,8209000," What else?"
8209000,8213000," Security, security, f."
8213000,8217080," If we don't use any of them, it doesn't really matter, actually."
8217560,8217800," Right."
8217800,8219560," So it just needs the declarations."
8219560,8223400," A10, a10 to f."
8223400,8226680," So it's two floats."
8226680,8229880," And the last one, consf."
8229880,8233960," And I suppose, cosf."
8233960,8235480," Let's see if..."
8238040,8238360," Yeah."
8238360,8238360," Yeah."
8238360,8238360," Yeah."
8238360,8240760," There we go."
8240760,8244120," Fminf."
8244120,8244440," Okay."
8244440,8249960," Fabs."
8249960,8250920," Oh, it's..."
8250920,8252920," It's without f."
8252920,8254520," It is also..."
8254520,8257000," A."
8259080,8259400," Right."
8259400,8261640," So, wait, what?"
8261640,8265400," Incompatible declaration."
8265400,8271480," That is bizarre."
8271480,8274520," Oh, because it's supposed to accept and return double, I see."
8274520,8277720," Oh, my God."
8277720,8278520," That's a lot of them."
8279640,8280920," So, and..."
8280920,8282440," So, we only have, like, 10..."
8282440,8288120," It's not really that many of them, honestly."
8288120,8291960," So, I'm pretty sure I can just do that manually."
8291960,8294920," A, cos, f."
8294920,8297720," So, I can do that."
8297720,8300600," Okay."
8300600,8302280," So, we went through all of them."
8302280,8305160," So, these are the mathematical functions that the code wants."
8305160,8307400," But it's not going to be used everywhere."
8307400,8310520," We can even take a look at wasn't to what."
8310520,8312200," Wasn't to what?"
8312200,8313960," And what do you want?"
8313960,8314920," Yeah."
8314920,8317320," It doesn't even want any of them because we don't use any of them."
8317320,8319000," So, yeah."
8319000,8320120," That's kind of the point, right?"
8320120,8321880," So, it factored them out anyway."
8321880,8324040," So, because we don't call to them."
8324040,8326280," It's kind of..."
8326280,8329640," All of that was needed to just kind of, like, satisfy the compiler."
8329640,8331880," But it was just the easiest way to do that, honestly."
8332280,8333720," That was just the easiest way to do that."
8333720,8338600," Okay, good."
8338600,8339480," So, that's fine."
8339480,8344920," And then, this kind of stuff can be solved in the array lib header, by the way."
8344920,8346520," In array math somewhere."
8346520,8349240," We can do the check if we are in a platform web."
8349240,8351960," Just, you know, do that differently, right?"
8351960,8353160," Just do that differently."
8353160,8355000," All right."
8355000,8357240," I'm losing my voice, by the way, right now."
8357240,8362120," So, let's try to run."
8362280,8363000," This entire thing."
8363000,8368600," I'm going to open the thing."
8368600,8371160," All right."
8371160,8373240," So, it keeps calling to all of this function."
8373240,8373480," Okay."
8373480,8374520," That's actually very cool."
8374520,8378280," So, we need to get screen width and get screen height."
8378280,8381720," Also, vector to scale, vector to add."
8381720,8384520," It's kind of funny that it didn't really inline them."
8385560,8388440," So, maybe this is something that we should do."
8388440,8390600," Right."
8390600,8397720," Because we can try to enable some optimizations, like 0.3 and recompile this entire stuff."
8397720,8401080," Because if you take a look at the array math."
8401080,8407000," Array math dot h vector to add."
8407000,8409240," Right."
8409240,8410440," So, they are inlineable."
8410440,8412440," So, and this thing is inlineable."
8412440,8414440," So, it should do that, in my opinion."
8414440,8415240," Look."
8415240,8416760," It also changed the background."
8416760,8417960," It also changed the background."
8417960,8419240," Okay."
8419240,8419640," Look at that."
8419640,8421240," It doesn't call to that function anymore."
8422120,8425480," So, you don't want to implement the function."
8425480,8427160," Just enable all of the optimizations."
8427160,8428680," It doesn't call to that function anymore."
8428680,8431800," Look at that."
8431800,8433400," It doesn't call to vector to add."
8433400,8434760," Because it wasn't inlineable."
8434760,8435720," So, it just inline it."
8435720,8440040," Optimize the way."
8440040,8440840," Optimize the way."
8440840,8441080," Okay."
8441080,8442920," So, what we need to do."
8442920,8450680," We need to implement arraylib.js get screen width."
8450680,8451880," It's actually super easy."
8451880,8453800," We just return whatever we set in here."
8453800,8457080," We will just return whatever we set in here."
8457080,8457960," So, that should be fine."
8457960,8460520," Get screen width."
8460520,8463640," And we can just do return."
8463640,8466200," CTX canvas width."
8466200,8470120," I wonder if you don't have to do even return."
8470120,8472360," I'm pretty sure you don't even have to do return."
8472360,8473400," So, this is going to be height."
8473400,8476200," And this is going to be that."
8476200,8477400," All right."
8477400,8478600," So, let me see."
8478600,8479000," Okay."
8479000,8481400," Get frame time is also really interesting."
8481400,8481880," Actually."
8481880,8484920," Get frame time."
8484920,8488360," So, we kind of need to keep track of that."
8488360,8490040," Actually."
8490040,8492520," DT undefined."
8492520,8494520," So, essentially."
8497000,8498040," We're going to do it like that."
8498040,8498920," Right."
8498920,8500200," We keep track of it."
8500200,8504040," And then we just let this thing return that."
8504040,8505800," So, we return literally DT."
8505800,8507480," Right."
8507480,8508840," So, we implemented all of these things."
8508840,8512280," The only thing that is needed to be implemented in here is draw circle."
8512280,8516120," And this one is interesting because we have to read these structures from the pointers."
8516120,8517800," Right."
8517800,8519640," So, but we already know how to do that."
8519640,8520920," So, it should be fine."
8520920,8525080," Draw circle V."
8525080,8526920," Circle V."
8527800,8528120," Right."
8528120,8535080," So, essentially, I believe that web version of Raylib should be implemented in JavaScript."
8535080,8536280," Right."
8536280,8540440," Just take all of the functions in Raylib and implement them in JavaScript."
8541560,8542920," And that will work."
8542920,8545480," That will, I think, for the most part."
8545480,8551160," Like, so far, I don't really see any major roadblocks that will prevent you from doing that."
8551160,8555480," Maybe compatibility with mscripten will suffer."
8555480,8563560," And judging the current modern software development culture, that could be actually a major roadblock or whatever."
8563560,8566760," But anyway, because the developers are so fucking lazy."
8568600,8573160," So, Raylib draw circle."
8573160,8574280," So, where is the Raylib?"
8574280,8578040," Draw circle V."
8578040,8579880," So, this is a center, radius, and color."
8579880,8580120," Okay."
8580120,8586200," Raylib center, radius, color."
8586200,8587480," So, it's actually something like that."
8587480,8588760," Okay."
8588760,8590120," So, these are the pointers."
8590120,8592120," And we need to do the memory trick."
8592120,8592440," All right."
8592440,8593960," So, this is going to be the memory trick."
8595640,8598520," This one is rather interesting, I think, because we can do..."
8598520,8602920," Do we have, like, floats?"
8602920,8610120," New float32 array buffer center."
8610120,8610840," Is that a thing?"
8610840,8613000," Is that a thing?"
8613000,8614920," So, we can try to do..."
8614920,8615160," Okay."
8615160,8616760," So, this is the pointer, obviously."
8616760,8618760," All right."
8618760,8619640," Center pointer."
8619640,8628680," Color, console, log, center, center."
8628680,8631240," And in terms of the color..."
8631240,8632120," All right."
8632120,8633800," So, we can also have this thing."
8635480,8641800," And we can, I suppose, extract this thing out afterwards."
8641800,8646120," Console, uh, const, color, like this."
8646120,8650040," So, we have center and we have, um, color."
8650040,8653320," There we go."
8653320,8656520," So, um, yeah."
8656520,8657800," Let's give it a try."
8657800,8658680," Let's give it a try."
8660280,8662520," Okay, so, oh yeah."
8662520,8665800," I think this has to be actually two."
8665800,8667640," All right."
8667640,8669160," This is too much."
8669160,8672440," This is not correct, actually."
8672440,8674040," I didn't think it is correct."
8674040,8675240," This is not a float."
8675240,8677480," What is it then?"
8677480,8680200," Center ptr."
8680200,8684120," Let's take a look at it from the point of view of uint."
8684680,8687160," And let's take, like, 10 bytes out of that."
8687160,8690440," Uh, all right."
8690440,8691800," So, we can clearly see..."
8691800,8695960," Right, if we extend that to, like, a little bit more..."
8695960,8702600," Right, we can clearly see, like, a pair of four bytes."
8702600,8704200," Sometimes it's actually kind of different."
8704200,8706360," So, it's not..."
8706360,8711160," It's not consistent, if you look at it."
8711160,8713160," It's actually not consistent."
8714680,8721480," So, it's really weird."
8721480,8724280," So, what's up with that?"
8724280,8729000," It is not in the memory."
8729000,8732200," Could be..."
8732200,8733640," Could it be stored in a pointer?"
8733640,8734200," Maybe."
8734200,8736040," Let's take a look at the definition of vector2."
8736040,8741240," So, it's two floats, right?"
8741240,8741480," So..."
8744360,8746120," It's two floats, so..."
8746120,8749400," And I suppose it should be actually consistent, right?"
8749400,8751720," So, I don't understand why it would not be."
8751720,8758040," Float32."
8758040,8759640," Yeah."
8759640,8764440," They're actually pretty big."
8764440,8767640," But not that much big, no?"
8768600,8770040," Not that much big."
8770040,8774440," So, what if we let this thing to simulate for a little bit?"
8774440,8776760," Okay."
8776760,8783400," So, what if we let this thing to simulate a little bit?"
8783400,8783720," Let's do it."
8783720,8786120," So, let's c equals zero."
8786120,8793320," And if c is less than 10, we're gonna do that."
8793320,8796920," c plus plus one."
8796920,8798840," Okay."
8798840,8801880," So, we're gonna simulate a bunch of frames."
8801880,8803720," Uh-huh."
8804600,8807320," And each frame this thing is completely different."
8807320,8808920," So, it's definitely not that."
8808920,8811080," It is definitely not that."
8811080,8812680," Which is hella bizarre."
8812680,8815960," So, how does it pass floats then?"
8815960,8820360," Like, I'm actually confused."
8820360,8821960," Like, how do you pass them then?"
8821960,8827160," Does it also change them every time?"
8827160,8829080," No."
8829080,8831240," The pointer is kind of the same."
8831240,8832360," Right."
8832360,8833720," The pointer is kind of the same."
8833720,8835640," Now, let's take a look at the color."
8835640,8838040," Where is the color?"
8838040,8838920," The color is the same."
8838920,8840920," The color is read correctly."
8840920,8842040," Color is the same."
8842040,8843960," And it seems to be the color of this thing."
8843960,8848040," It's only this stuff that is really weird."
8848920,8849880," And I don't..."
8849880,8851640," Is that because of the optimizations?"
8851640,8852040," Okay."
8852040,8853880," So, we can just disable optimizations."
8853880,8856600," Because maybe optimizations break this entire shit."
8856600,8859000," Uh, maybe that's what's going on."
8859000,8860760," So, let's disable optimizations."
8860760,8865080," But in that case, we need to implement vector2 add and vector2 scale."
8865080,8866600," And stuff like that."
8866600,8867720," Right."
8867720,8870440," Which means that maybe I can do that manually."
8870440,8870840," Right."
8870840,8872120," So, let me go to the game."
8872120,8873960," And shit like that."
8873960,8876520," Right."
8876520,8879640," So, I'm not going to call to any of those things."
8879640,8881960," What I'm going to do..."
8881960,8894200," I'm going to do ball position x plus ball velocity x multiplied by get time."
8894200,8897240," So, this one is flow dt like so."
8897240,8898680," Delta time."
8899480,8900760," And it's going to be y."
8900760,8901880," Y."
8901880,8903000," All right."
8903000,8905160," And let's try to recompile this entire thing."
8905160,8907720," All right."
8907720,8910680," And I'm going to refresh this entire thing."
8910680,8912280," And it's still the same."
8912280,8914440," So, it was not because of the optimization."
8914440,8917080," It was not because of the optimization."
8918840,8921800," I just don't know how to read this entire thing then."
8921800,8932360," So, clang wasm passing structures."
8932360,8933080," Is there any..."
8933080,8937240," Is ptr multiplied by 4 in float array?"
8937240,8940040," But we're getting the point to the beginning."
8940040,8940840," It doesn't really matter."
8944600,8947560," So, we can try to maybe multiply it by 4, but..."
8947560,8951640," So, float 32 array."
8951640,8959080," Please don't tell me that the size is in bytes."
8959080,8959960," I don't believe that."
8959960,8962600," I don't believe that it's that dumb."
8965000,8965640," What's length?"
8965640,8965720," What's length?"
8965720,8967800," Definition of length, please."
8967800,8969240," Definition of length."
8969240,8981880," Bytes per element."
8981880,8985320," Really?"
8985320,8989720," Wait a second."
8989720,8992920," I really..."
8992920,8993400," Like, I mean..."
8995560,8996600," So, if it's..."
8996600,8998440," That must be 8 in that case, right?"
8998440,9001240," So, it must be 8 if it's true, if it's bytes."
9001240,9002440," Yeah, yeah."
9002440,9004040," So, it just returned me 8 bytes."
9004040,9005080," So, it's not true."
9005080,9007640," It's actually not true."
9007640,9013480," Is that different endianess?"
9013480,9018680," Is that different endianess, though?"
9024680,9031480," Float64, I don't think it is gonna matter."
9031480,9034120," Is there even such thing as float64?"
9034120,9034760," I don't think so."
9034760,9038440," Nah, it's not that."
9040280,9040920," Uint32."
9040920,9048920," So, we are interpreting it..."
9048920,9052360," It could be endianess problem."
9052360,9054120," Like, honestly."
9054120,9063000," I don't know how to read that."
9063800,9065000," I don't know why I pretend like I do."
9065000,9065160," I don't know why I pretend like I do."
9065160,9068680," So, does it accept endianess?"
9068680,9069080," I didn't..."
9069080,9071240," Byte offset."
9071240,9073480," So, buffer."
9073480,9075000," Byte offset."
9075000,9076920," And length."
9076920,9078840," All right."
9078840,9080520," So, clang wasm passing."
9080520,9081640," Okay."
9081640,9085240," Expert structure from C to wasm."
9091800,9092280," Oh my god."
9092280,9093160," So much text."
9093160,9113880," The problem is that I'm stuck and I don't understand."
9113880,9115960," Like, what else can you do in here?"
9115960,9116920," Like, eh?"
9116920,9118680," So, that's it."
9118680,9120200," Like, that's the end of the story."
9120200,9124440," That's the end of the fucking story, right?"
9124440,9125720," This is just like, eh?"
9125720,9127800," So..."
9130360,9130680," Okay."
9130680,9132040," So, what else can you do in here?"
9132040,9141480," It's such a dumb problem as well, right?"
9141480,9142680," It's like, it's..."
9142680,9147160," It works perfectly in some other places as well, right?"
9147160,9149400," So, it usually works perfectly."
9149400,9149960," It's something..."
9149960,9151720," Okay."
9151720,9154120," Let's try to just do a different function."
9155640,9156360," It's not like..."
9156360,9160760," It's like, what else can you even do?"
9160760,9161000," Right."
9161000,9162040," So, you get a pointer."
9162040,9164760," You get floats 32."
9164760,9167240," You just read them if the end is incorrect."
9167240,9168680," That should be the end of the story."
9168680,9171080," That must be the end of the story."
9171080,9173320," I don't know why I'm even wasting time on that."
9173320,9173720," It's just like..."
9173720,9179720," What kind of quirk or trick can you even expect in this situation?"
9179720,9185480," It's either some sort of weird quirk or trick, or I'm just doing that incorrectly."
9185480,9186440," Right?"
9186440,9188600," It's just like, what else can it be in here?"
9188600,9190280," Like, how else would you even do that?"
9190280,9191400," Come on!"
9191400,9194600," So dumb."
9194600,9195560," Like, I swear to God."
9195560,9195880," Anyway."
9195880,9199080," So, draw a circle then."
9199080,9200600," Let's give the draw circle a try."
9200600,9202600," Okay."
9202600,9206440," So, I don't see any other way to solve that, I suppose."
9206440,9208520," Except using that."
9209320,9212360," So, I suppose some sort of research is required in here."
9212360,9212680," Right?"
9212680,9219800," So, ball position x, ball position y."
9219800,9223960," The radius is going to be ball radius, and this one is going to be red."
9223960,9226200," So, in all of these cases, it's a little bit easier, I think."
9226200,9227080," Right?"
9227080,9230040," So, because the only pointer we're going to have in there is the color."
9230040,9231560," Right?"
9231560,9234920," So, what else do we have?"
9234920,9235960," So, I didn't recompile."
9235960,9238360," So, let's recompile."
9238920,9240280," And, okay."
9240280,9241400," So..."
9241400,9242120," So..."
9242120,9251400," Ha!"
9251400,9251560," Ha!"
9251560,9261400," Okay, that is sus."
9261400,9263640," Okay, so maybe the problem is not what I thought."
9264840,9265480," All right."
9265480,9267480," Because what do we do in here is that..."
9267480,9272120," Aha!"
9272120,9274120," So, maybe it's something else."
9274120,9275560," Right."
9275560,9277560," When we do get width, we return..."
9277560,9281880," I have a feeling, just a second,"
9281880,9286760," that when I do get width, I actually return something bogus."
9287320,9288280," That's what's probably going on."
9288280,9288440," That's what's probably going on."
9288440,9292440," City x canvas width."
9292440,9294440," Let me see."
9294440,9297400," What do you want from here?"
9297400,9303480," It's not really that bogus, honestly."
9303480,9306440," It's not really that."
9309560,9312200," So, what about delta time?"
9312200,9314360," The delta time should be fine as well."
9314360,9315880," Right."
9315880,9317160," So, we return the..."
9317160,9318360," Is that because I..."
9318360,9319560," Wait a second!"
9319560,9322120," Do I always have to do return in here?"
9328440,9329640," No, it's not necessarily."
9329640,9329880," No."
9329880,9333400," So, delta time returns..."
9333400,9334920," Fucking..."
9334920,9336760," JavaScript!"
9336760,9338120," Freaking..."
9338120,9340520," Oh, my God!"
9340520,9344360," Oh, my God!"
9344360,9349240," All right."
9349240,9349880," All right."
9349880,9350760," Calm down."
9350760,9352040," Zozin, calm down."
9353000,9358440," This freaking JavaScript always needs to find a way to fuck you up."
9358440,9361640," Freaking web!"
9361640,9363880," Like, why do they always fucking do that?"
9363880,9366440," It's like..."
9366440,9373480," They just can't solve a problem."
9373480,9379560," These motherfuckers need to introduce some gotchas to fuck you up every single fucking time."
9379560,9381160," They can't just do that."
9381160,9384040," They can't just design a normal fucking language."
9384040,9385720," A normal fucking API."
9385720,9387160," They just can't do that."
9387160,9388920," They're incapable of doing that."
9388920,9392280," Okay."
9392280,9396600," Sorry."
9396600,9405000," You copy-pasted your function and now your code is garbage."
9405000,9406040," Again!"
9406040,9408520," Put that in a phrase."
9411160,9415480," God, I love it so much."
9415480,9417160," It's such a cool phrase."
9417160,9421640," You copy-pasted a function without understanding what it does and now your code is garbage."
9421640,9422680," Again!"
9422680,9424680," Because you copy-pasted!"
9426680,9427480," So fucking good."
9427480,9432360," God bless, Linus."
9432360,9434040," Linus, please."
9434040,9435480," Please."
9435480,9437640," Don't take your pills."
9437640,9439320," Ignore your therapist."
9439320,9441080," Please don't change."
9441080,9443400," Please be yourself, Linus."
9443400,9444600," The world needs you."
9444600,9446920," The world needs you to be yourself."
9446920,9448760," Don't fucking listen to those people."
9448760,9451400," Don't fucking listen to stakeholders."
9451960,9452760," Be yourself."
9452760,9454200," Please."
9454200,9456760," I beg you, Linus."
9456760,9457400," Please."
9457400,9458920," The world needs you."
9458920,9460680," Anyway, so..."
9460680,9464120," So, this is supposed to be..."
9464120,9465320," So, this is floats, right?"
9465320,9466680," So, you know..."
9466680,9470200," Get frame time."
9470200,9473560," Yeah, it is floats and should be fine then."
9473560,9474360," That should be fine."
9474360,9475960," So, that's probably the reason."
9475960,9481400," And in that case, we don't really even need to implement anything else."
9481400,9482200," Right."
9482200,9482520," So..."
9482520,9484920," Okay."
9484920,9488280," All right."
9488280,9490120," So, this is just drawCircle."
9491960,9496920," Let me go back to the drawCircleV."
9496920,9501400," DrawCircleV."
9501400,9504520," Aha."
9504520,9508120," Well, this thing keeps changing, right?"
9508120,9509400," Which is understandable."
9509400,9514200," So, Raylib.js."
9514200,9516200," J.S."
9517720,9518040," Right."
9518040,9519400," Like, and I spend the time..."
9519400,9520120," I should have not..."
9520120,9521880," Oh, my God."
9521880,9532840," So, here's an interesting thing, Chad."
9532840,9533880," Here's an interesting thing."
9533880,9540920," Anybody who ever done any computer graphics in their entire life, even a little bit,"
9541800,9549160," knows that you operate with delta time in seconds and floats."
9549160,9555720," Like, if you worked just a little bit and you know how animations are done"
9555720,9558920," and how they're scaled with time resolution and stuff like that,"
9558920,9564200," you know time must be in seconds stored as a float."
9564200,9569800," And all of the graphics library, all of the graphics API that allow you to do things,"
9569800,9573240," like for engines and game development, they do that."
9573240,9575800," Not the fucking web!"
9575800,9577480," Not the fucking web!"
9577480,9578040," Fuck you!"
9578040,9578840," Fuck you!"
9578840,9581720," Sorry."
9581720,9586040," Sorry."
9586040,9587560," Everything's fine."
9587560,9588920," We figured it out."
9588920,9589800," We figured it out."
9589800,9595720," So, now what we can have, we can actually have X and Y, right?"
9595720,9601560," So, we can basically destructure this thing and, you know, render this entire thing."
9601560,9603160," So, how do you fill the circles, by the way?"
9603160,9605480," This is a completely separate thing."
9605480,9608920," Canvas, HTML5, fill circle."
9608920,9612120," I think you do that through arc, right?"
9612120,9614680," So, you do that through arc."
9615400,9617080," They have excuses for this for sure."
9617080,9618600," Of course, I know, right?"
9618600,9621640," So, every stupid fucking decision has an excuse."
9621640,9622600," Everybody knows that."
9622600,9624120," All right."
9624120,9626280," So, is that a full one or is that..."
9626280,9630200," So, it's 2pi, so it must be full."
9630200,9631880," All right."
9631880,9634760," So, you have to begin path and..."
9634760,9635240," Yeah, yeah."
9635240,9637800," So, that should be fine for us."
9637800,9640120," So, draw a circle."
9640120,9641800," Begin path."
9641800,9642280," Center."
9642280,9644600," So, it's an X, Y."
9644600,9646280," The radius."
9646280,9647080," Do we have the radius?"
9647080,9648200," Yeah, we do have the radius."
9648200,9649240," So, I can keep it like that."
9649240,9650120," 0, 2pi."
9650120,9651480," False."
9651480,9653000," I have no idea what the fuck is that."
9653000,9653720," So, I don't care."
9653720,9655720," The color is this."
9655720,9657400," Then, we fill this thing and that's it."
9657400,9658840," That should be it, mine."
9660440,9662600," That should be it, mine, Freunde."
9662600,9665320," Oh, fuck."
9665320,9666040," Oh, shit."
9666040,9666680," Oh, fuck."
9666680,9666920," Damn."
9666920,9667800," Okay."
9667800,9668920," So, this has to be colored."
9668920,9671720," All right."
9671720,9674440," Context is not found, of course."
9674440,9677320," CTX."
9690440,9701880," So, yeah."
9701880,9704440," So, this is..."
9704440,9708600," So, this file, 112 lines of code."
9708600,9714040," 112 lines of code is an implementation of a subset of RayLib."
9715320,9720280," enough to actually make this native example work."
9720280,9723240," So, we can actually try to finish this thing."
9723240,9725080," We can actually try to finish this thing."
9725080,9727400," I'm going to go to game C."
9727400,9731080," And what I'm going to do, I'm going to make it bounce off of the edges."
9731080,9731240," Right."
9731240,9733000," So, the usual thing that I like to do."
9733000,9734200," Right."
9734200,9736440," So, we're going to have something like float X in here."
9736440,9737480," So, this is the new X."
9737480,9741640," And if X plus ball radius..."
9741640,9747400," Actually, radius minus ball radius is less than zero."
9747400,9755560," Or X plus ball radius is greater or equal to get screen width."
9756360,9756920," Right."
9756920,9761320," So, we're actually switching up the velocity."
9761320,9761560," Right."
9761560,9764440," So, we're actually switching up the velocity."
9764440,9765960," We're multiplying it by that."
9765960,9773480," Otherwise, we are reassigning ball position X to X."
9773480,9774440," Right."
9774440,9777160," And repeating all of that to Y as well,"
9777160,9779400," which will effectively make it bounce off of the edges."
9779400,9780440," So, this is going to be Y."
9780440,9781560," Y."
9781560,9788920," This is going to be the height, the height, Y, Y, Y."
9788920,9792280," So, in the float, well, we probably also have to repeat that for Y."
9792280,9793240," So, the usual thing."
9793240,9793880," Nothing special."
9793880,9795400," I already implemented that multiple times."
9795400,9798920," You're not seeing anything particularly new."
9798920,9802440," So, we could also maybe make it a little bit faster."
9802440,9803560," Right."
9803560,9805000," We can make it a little bit faster."
9805000,9807720," So, maybe 200 things in here."
9807720,9809400," So, we're going to recompile this into, I think."
9809400,9812120," And let's go to here."
9812120,9815560," So, let's actually open this thing."
9815560,9817640," Yep."
9817640,9818680," So, this is in web."
9818680,9821160," I pressed OK."
9821160,9830600," Like, it lags so much."
9830600,9831960," I don't understand what the fuck is going on."
9831960,9832360," But anyway."
9832360,9834360," So, this is the demo."
9834360,9834680," Right."
9834680,9837240," But it also works on both of the platforms."
9837240,9837560," All right."
9837560,9840920," So, I'm literally rebuilding both of them."
9840920,9842120," It's kind of weird."
9842120,9843960," I think I should modify my make file."
9843960,9847400," So, all game wasm game native."
9847400,9848520," All right."
9848520,9850120," So, I'm rebuilding all of them."
9850120,9851640," And I can run game native."
9851640,9853160," There we go."
9853160,9860200," So, this is universal code."
9860200,9860760," Right."
9860760,9861720," The same file."
9861720,9868360," So, again, same file is compilable for web and for native."
9868360,9870120," And I'm not using Raylib native."
9870120,9875800," What I did, I just took the API of Raylib, subset of the API of Raylib."
9875800,9878040," And I implemented enough to make it work."
9878040,9881000," I'm not using mscripten at all."
9881720,9883960," And it's a way simpler setup."
9883960,9884200," Right."
9884200,9885640," It's a way simpler setup."
9885640,9885880," Right."
9885880,9889160," So, the only kind of difficult thing in here is this command line."
9889160,9893400," But I'm pretty sure you can make some sort of wrapper that is shipped with Raylib that"
9893400,9895560," just basically does this kind of stuff for you."
9896120,9896760," Right."
9896760,9899000," So, you can make it a little bit easier to setup."
9899000,9905080," But the fact that this entire thing doesn't have that many moving parts, that's what's cool about it."
9905080,9909720," That's what's cool about this kind of stuff."
9909720,9912600," Like, it doesn't have that many moving parts."
9912600,9917720," And in fact, the entirety of the game is like 1.7 kilobytes."
9917720,9920440," And the runtime of Raylib is actually in JavaScript."
9920440,9921800," Right."
9922840,9925720," So, yeah, that is actually very cool."
9925720,9928280," I think that is insanely cool."
9928280,9933240," So, we can go further and add more interesting things."
9933240,9935160," For example, we can add gravity."
9935160,9935480," Right."
9935480,9937640," So, define gravity."
9937640,9939480," Right."
9939480,9943560," So, let's make it like 1,000 or something like that."
9943560,9948280," And so, before we modify, right."
9948280,9952200," So, we're going to do ball velocity y."
9953640,9957560," We're going to add gravity multiplied by delta time."
9957560,9957800," Right."
9957800,9958840," So, we're going to just do that."
9958840,9960760," That automatically adds the gravity."
9960760,9962200," Right."
9962200,9965080," So, we need to recompile both of these things."
9965080,9965320," Right."
9965320,9966040," We're recompiling."
9966040,9967960," I'm going to refresh this entire thing."
9967960,9969320," And now, we have gravity."
9969320,9971000," So, yeah."
9971000,9975640," So, it doesn't lose any energy."
9975640,9977080," So, it's going to go like that forever."
9977080,9979960," So, yeah."
9979960,9985800," So, this is obviously not a full implementation of Raylib."
9985800,9989320," Obviously, you cannot take any Raylib example and run it like that."
9989320,9996680," But I think it's a pretty cool proof of concept of how Raylib, in my opinion, should have worked."
9999400,9999800," Right."
9999800,10002120," Again, it's my opinion."
10002120,10010760," I know that the opinion of today's software developers is that the complexity of the setup doesn't matter."
10010760,10011000," Right."
10011000,10014920," So, you can pile a lot of crap on top as much as possible."
10014920,10024600," But, if Raylib followed the spirit of simplicity that it does in PRC, I think it should be implemented like that."
10024600,10025800," Right."
10025800,10029160," Because this approach follows the spirit of Raylib."
10029160,10032440," Isn't that the spirit of Raylib?"
10032440,10034120," I think this is the spirit of Raylib."
10034120,10037800," Can you now respect the FPS settings?"
10037800,10038360," I don't know."
10038360,10039800," Probably don't."
10039800,10041160," But can mscripten?"
10043400,10049800," So, it's the question of can you set up FPS in web?"
10049800,10052040," It can't."
10052040,10052360," Okay."
10052360,10059720," Really good work."
10059720,10061720," I think Raysan is definitely going to check that."
10061720,10069240," I think it would be actually kind of cool to make some sort of like a proper official proposal to Raysan."
10070200,10074600," So, it would be kind of rude to just, you know, give him a link to this stream."
10074600,10075800," Because, I mean, it's a long stream."
10075800,10077320," He's probably not going to watch that."
10077320,10079800," It would be kind of cool to make like a proper demo."
10079800,10084520," Proper demo with like explanations and justifications and stuff like that."
10084520,10090920," And also short video of me explaining this approach and philosophy of this approach."
10090920,10094680," And suggest to maybe, you know, start working on that."
10094680,10097240," But another question is that who's going to implement that?"
10097240,10098280," Right."
10099160,10107480," I obviously technically can spend time implementing all of that and bring a Raylib to that level."
10107480,10111400," But first of all, I'm not paid for that."
10113080,10118040," Or I could do that as a content, but it's a very long project."
10118040,10122440," And if I will just keep working on that, I'm going to start losing views."
10122440,10126680," Like, it's very difficult for me to work on long projects without losing views."
10126680,10131080," So, like, it's a matter of resources, right?"
10131080,10135640," Technically, I know I have technical abilities to do that."
10135640,10136840," I know how to do that."
10137720,10139000," I just don't have resources."
10139000,10141160," Like, I literally don't have resources to do that."
10141160,10146200," So, yeah."
10146200,10150600," Try to talk with Raysan."
10150600,10151880," I think he's a very reasonable man."
10151880,10156920," I mean, I'm not begging for money, by the way."
10156920,10158280," Just want to make it clear."
10158280,10160440," I'm not begging for money."
10160440,10164200," I'm just saying that I would like to do that."
10164200,10167000," I just don't have time, right?"
10167000,10168440," I don't have resources to do that."
10168440,10169800," That's what I'm saying."
10169800,10171240," It's just like, I would like to do that."
10171240,10173240," But, I mean, how am I going to be doing that?"
10173240,10174760," I'm going to be doing that as a content?"
10174760,10179800," Well, I mean, by the nature of my content, I have to constantly switch the projects."
10179800,10181320," It's probably not going to work."
10181320,10186120," But anyway, I can make the demo."
10186120,10191400," I can make a proof of concept and send to Raysan and ask him what he thinks about that."
10191400,10195320," That's about it, right?"
10196280,10200680," ""How do you know all the different intricacies of so many different languages?"
10200680,10205320," Like, how do you know initializing variables with undefined is better than this?"""
10205320,10206360," I don't."
10206360,10209560," This is just arbitrary decision out of my ass."
10215240,10231560," I suppose when we focused out, the scheduling of the frames actually stopped."
10234120,10234680," Right."
10234680,10237720," And maybe something messed up the delta time."
10237720,10238520," That's my hypothesis."
10238520,10240840," Something probably messed up the delta time."
10240840,10253560," What's interesting is that you can even implement things like load images and everything."
10253560,10254120," Right."
10254120,10258040," Because you can do actual fetches when you load an image."
10258040,10261160," Right."
10261160,10264600," Image load or load image."
10264600,10266200," You can do an actual fetch."
10267080,10270680," And then instead of, well, you can return a structure."
10270680,10271160," Right."
10271160,10273720," Yeah."
10273720,10275160," There's a lot of things you can do."
10275160,10275400," Right."
10275400,10277320," You can do an actual fetch."
10277320,10279960," Then you can load it into the memory of Raylib."
10279960,10280360," Right."
10280360,10283080," And yeah, give that thing to you."
10283080,10283320," Right."
10283320,10290120," So, I don't really see what kind of functions you cannot implement in here."
10290120,10293560," Anything like OpenGL related can be implemented."
10293560,10295640," Like, it's a lot of work, actually."
10295640,10297880," Like, it's a lot of work, but it's doable."
10297880,10301640," And at the end of that work, I think Raylib would be a better library."
10301640,10302600," Much better library."
10302600,10306920," And it will follow its spirit of simplicity, even in the web."
10306920,10308600," Audio."
10309160,10310600," Audio, I think it's possible."
10310600,10313000," I mean, web does have audio API, I think."
10313000,10315240," I think it does have audio API."
10315240,10321080," It's just like, I suppose the main problem with this approach is that you have to throw away"
10321080,10327480," like all of the dependency of Raylib as of right now."
10327480,10327720," Right."
10327720,10329560," So, you just have to throw away literally everything."
10329560,10332680," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
10332680,10335160," So, that's the main problem."
10335160,10337720," That's probably the main setback."
10338280,10340040," And you kind of need like a separate..."
10340040,10343960," Like, it's a completely separate implementation."
10343960,10346440," Separate from everything."
10346440,10349720," And you need to even maintain that implementation separately."
10349720,10352600," So, that could be the major setback for this approach."
10357400,10361320," So, if Raylib used this, I would use Raylib for web."
10361320,10365400," Because it relies heavily only on mscripten."
10365400,10369400," I probably won't use Raylib for that."
10369400,10373160," Though, I may actually..."
10373160,10380040," For my projects, I may implement this small set of Raylib specifically to just keep them running in the browser."
10380040,10381800," That is something that I can do."
10381800,10383400," Right."
10383400,10384360," So, that could be feasible."
10384360,10386440," All right."
10386440,10388440," So, anyway, I guess that's it for today."
10388440,10390920," Thanks everyone who's watching me right now."
10390920,10391720," I really appreciate that."
10391720,10394120," I hope today's stream was educational."
10394120,10394920," Right."
10394920,10401080," So, I do rant a lot about web and new modern software."
10401080,10402920," I do rant a lot."
10402920,10404520," And people are aware of that."
10406120,10411640," But also, on the other hand, I'm making sure that I'm also solving problems."
10411640,10411880," Right."
10411880,10415080," You see, I'm ranting about mscripten."
10415080,10417560," I'm ranting about web and stuff like that."
10417560,10419400," But I also propose a better way."
10419400,10420680," Didn't I?"
10420680,10421720," And I made it work."
10421720,10422600," Right."
10422600,10425560," So, yeah."
10425560,10427640," Every time you think, oh, he's ranting a lot."
10427640,10429320," I also solve problems."
10429320,10429880," Right."
10429880,10434920," So, me ranting and complaining is part of the process."
10434920,10435560," Right."
10435560,10439160," So, I switch myself into this hypercritical mode."
10439160,10442680," So, it's easier for me to understand problems and solve them."
10442680,10443560," Right."
10443560,10445800," So, yeah."
10445800,10447240," Anyway."
10447240,10448360," That's it for today."
10448360,10449880," Thanks everyone for watching."
10449880,10455080," And I see you all on the next recreation programming session with Azusa."
