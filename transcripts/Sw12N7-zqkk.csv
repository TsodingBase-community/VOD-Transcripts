640,7280," Looks like we're live. Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session"
7280,13120," with Amista Zozin. Let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start the stream."
13120,20640," So RedCircle live on Twitch and what are we doing today on twitch.at television website?"
20640,27440," Today chat is dedosing me as a program in Rust, right? So I'm gonna give the link to where we're"
27440,33040," doing all that twitch.tv/todding and I'm gonna ping everyone who's interested in being pinged and"
33040,38960," there we go the stream has officially started. The stream has officially started. So today we're gonna"
38960,44080," continue developing for @ which is a simple chat application that we started to develop like a"
44080,50320," couple of streams ago actually. Right so you can find the the source code in the chat and for people"
50320,54720," on youtube it's going to be in the description. Hopefully it's going to be there. So on the previous"
54720,57920," stream we actually rewrote the entire thing in Rust."
57920,67280," We literally performed re-write it in Rust meme right on the stream and I believe we actually"
67280,73040," recreated the entire functionality of the chat. We can take a look at how it looks like. So essentially"
73040,78640," here you have a server right so as you can see we started the server. Then we can open up a bunch of"
78640,85120," clients right so and I'm going to split the screen like that so we're going to do telnet"
85120,95360," 20s1001 6969. This is the first client right so might as well even do something epic and use TeamUX"
95360,101840," capabilities of copy pasting things and put this thing in here and now I have two chat applications that"
101840,108160," can uh communicate with you with each other right so as you can see they can see each other messages and"
108160,113360," stuff like that so if you disconnect as you can see all of that is detected appropriately and stuff like"
113360,119200," that you can even try to de-dos that uh right so basic send a lot of meaningless and you will be"
119200,126320," automatically banned because we detect that as well uh right so we can uh take cat div u random and we"
127040,134880," we're going to redirect it to nc and 27001 6969 and as you can see uh it got automatically detected and you"
134880,141920," got banned you got banned and if you try to connect uh it will tell you that you cannot connect for like"
141920,149840," 10 minutes right so this is basically the timeout uh this is basically the timeout so uh and it seems to"
149840,156480," be working we haven't battle tested it yet uh because at the time i was not sure how to filter out the"
156480,162480," escape sequences luckily uh people on our discord server actually helped me out and suggested a"
162480,168720," pretty cool way of uh filtering out the escape sequences you can basically uh filter out all of"
168720,175360," the characters that are less than 32 right and automatically you would uh filter out all the escape"
175360,181840," sequences and you won't basically kill um you know the correct utf encoding so utf encoding is going"
181840,186400," to be preserved though you also kind of kill the new lines which are useful sometimes"
186400,192320," what we actually append new lines when we broadcast the message to everyone uh right when we broadcast"
192320,199360," the message to everyone uh so this application theoretically should work worse than the go one"
199360,203760," right so the go application is still available in the source code so there's a folder like legacy go"
203760,207840," version in case you still need it right it's going to be there it's going to be theoretically perform"
207840,216320," worse than the go version because rust uses the real threats not a lightweight green threats so as"
216320,220560," essentially it's going to create a thread per connection it's going to create a thread per"
220560,226640," connection and uh what i'm thinking maybe it's not that big of a deal right so the way you get the"
226640,236160," amount of threats you can create on uh linux right so let's actually see uh how to get the amount of"
236720,244560," the maximum threats uh limit on linux and let's actually go to google right i think it will be"
244560,251280," able to tell me uh so there is a file in here right so there is a very interesting file proxies kernel"
251280,258080," threads max right so in essentially it's a text file if you go ahead and simply cut it it tells you how"
258080,264800," many threads you can create so on my machine i can create like 60 60 000 threads right so 60 000 threads we can"
264800,270080," ssh to your mom right and it's a vps server right it's a vps server and if you take a look at how"
270080,277520," many uh threads you can perform on there it's actually two million threads and like yesterday was three"
277520,283440," million i don't really know how exactly they set it up or how it is configured but maybe this amount of"
283440,291760," threats is going to be enough for everybody maybe it is going to be enough i'm not 100 sure right i'm not"
291760,296960," any procedure but we can just go ahead and test it out with this thing so let's just go ahead and test"
296960,304720," it out uh i'm going to like i already uh git cloned the application on my server right so as you can see"
304720,311360," uh i can uh try to build it up so i already have a rust compiler and everything actually using git repo is"
311360,318640," very convenient in a sense that uh i can just push some changes and then i can ssh to the server and just pull"
318640,324320," them from from github right so those very conveniently updating everything i think that's actually pretty"
324320,330800," cool uh i think that's actually pretty cool so here is the server but to be fair i would like to actually"
330800,336000," compile this entire thing in a safe mode right so let's actually compile all that in a safe mode so we"
336000,342400," do not accidentally leak any sensitive information uh i try to screen as much as information as possible"
343040,350960," uh right and uh so let's go ahead and rebuild this entire thing so essentially do you guys remember"
350960,357040," the ip of the server do you guys remember the ip of the server so i can give you the ip if you guys"
357040,367520," forgot the ip so it's going to be actually in ssh config so i do have the ip in here the leaked ip"
367520,374000," so this is the ip the port is 69 69 right so remember that remember that i'm going to start"
374000,380160," it and try to basically connect there and type something in there so if you're going to try to"
380160,386080," type something tos unfriendly we're printing only the ascii codes of the characters so it's not going to be"
386080,392080," obviously visible on the screen so yeah people are connecting"
392080,399600," all right and we're also figuring out escape sequences right so that should be fine"
399600,406480," i'm going to try to uh do that as well i'm going to try to tell net to this thing and see what people"
406480,408800," are writing hello"
408800,413760," so"
413760,420880," all right i can see some stuff i can actually see some stuff and it seems to be performing well"
420880,422880," seems to be performing well enough"
422880,433280," uh so people are trying to what the is like uh okay so let me let me kill this entire thing uh just a"
433280,439600," second what the people are opening that in the browser yet again right so or trying to establish"
439600,444160," ssh connection you don't have to establish ssh connection or anything what the is things"
444160,451440," uh all right so god is coming in two minutes this is already like the second time i see somebody"
451440,457760," actually writing that uh right so this is already like a second time i see somebody writing that"
458560,464400," all right so some people got banned by the way some people straight up got banned so the band system"
464400,470640," automatically working and everything so everything seems to be working right so i i don't know how"
470640,474320," well it performs compared to go but i think it performs all right"
474320,478880," so um yeah"
478880,486480," okay so essentially one of the problems that i have with this entire system is that it is basically"
487280,492640," uh exposed to everyone right it's a little bit of a problem right it's a little bit of a problem"
492640,500320," so essentially i want this system to be exposed only to people that i trust uh luckily there is"
500320,506400," quite a few of such people right so there is quite a few of such people so the idea i came up with the"
506400,512000," idea i've came up with let's introduce for now at least at least for now so later we're going to have"
512000,518480," something better hopefully uh introduce uh authentication token so essentially when you"
518480,526640," start up the server the server generates a random token and you can only uh connect to the uh to the"
526640,533200," server and start chatting after you provided that secret token that uh only the trusted people know"
534080,541840," how can we uh tell that token only to trusted people uh right so i came up with the following"
541840,548160," idea we're going to do that through discord right uh on the discord discord is actually um it's readable"
548160,555840," for everyone uh but it's writable only for people who are subbed or the 90 through patreon or like manually"
555840,562000," trusted right so essentially i created the channel that only the people who have the voice on the"
562000,568560," server can see and every time we start the judo session and with every time we started the session"
568560,575440," i'm going to be posting that token that one time talking in this channel so only people who can write"
575440,580880," into the server can actually see that token and can actually connect to the server so it all that is"
580880,588080," going to be uh all of that is going to be uh over unsecured connection over the plain socket connection"
588080,594240," so it could be probably potentially spoofed but it's a temporary solution right it's a temporary solution"
594240,602000," until we introduced encryption right so uh after we um introduced this sort of token authentication"
602800,611040," right people instantly said uh time to man in the middle right so uh and of course the token can be"
611040,616800," leaked sure but we're going to generate a new token every time we start the ddos session like every time"
616800,620880," uh we start a new thing it's going to be a new token and every time i'm going to be posting it there"
620880,624960," so that's going to be basically the idea so it's not going to be a permanent token it's going to be"
624960,627600," constantly changing it's going to be constantly changing"
627600,636880," sounds good sounds gucci sounds tabangucci and in that case i will be a little bit more comfortable"
636880,643840," with sharing the full log of the chat because i know only the people who have a special role in here"
643840,649440," can write something there so we can minimize over tos and friendly messages on the screen so that will"
650000,654960," will be a little bit easier for me so i think it's a pretty good solution right more or less it's not"
654960,660880," perfect but it's more of a good solution so let's go ahead and do that let's go ahead and do that chat"
660880,668720," so do you know what that means do you know what that means we need to be able to generate random numbers in rust"
672080,682000," and here's the thing rust the standard library of rust the standard library of rust doesn't have a random"
682000,690480," number generator because you it's unsafe right so um yeah you you have to use crate like there is no other"
690480,698880," way to generate random numbers in rust except using crates and like cargo and stuff like that and i'm very"
698880,705520," much uh i call myself like a spartan software developer i like to use just like a bare compiler"
705520,710160," without package managers and stuff like that with minimal dependencies but in rust i'm kind of forced"
710160,715200," to use cargo but we're going to be using cargo nonetheless because we will need an encryption"
715200,721280," right we'll need an encryption and for the encryption luckily by the way in case of encryption in rust there"
721280,728640," is such thing as a rust tls right so it's a basically open ssh alternative it's a tls library but it's"
728640,735920," implemented 100 percent in rust 100 percent in a safe rust as far as i know there's no single unsafe"
735920,742880," keyword in there right it's fully implemented in in a safe rust um right which doesn't really mean much"
742880,748400," right because you can have unsafe like a memory safe buffer overflows but that's besides the point"
748400,754000," so uh yes so yes so yes so we're probably going to be using that and we're probably going to be"
754000,759760," um you know introducing that as a dependency we're going to be introducing that as a dependence"
759760,766640," uh so yeah so what we need to do in here we need to transform our application into"
768640,774720," uh into crate project right so into crate project so if i try to maybe one of the things i'm going"
774720,779600," to do i'm going to create the src folder right and we're going to put the server right the server in"
779600,787760," here into here so there's one problem with turning that into a crate project the the name of the project"
787760,796480," itself starts with four yikes so if you try to do cargo in it you're going to be slapped in the face right"
796480,804400," away so yeah you cannot uh this name cannot be used as a package name the name cannot start with a digit"
804400,810560," if you need the package name and to not match the directory name uh consider using name blah blah blah"
810560,821280," right so yeah that's a little bit of a problem um so one of the probably solutions that people were"
821280,828640," suggesting is to basically rename the project into hat i think i saw that in a in the youtube comments"
828640,836000," right instead of uh for at uh call it hat and the reason why we call it for it in the first place is"
836000,844880," because chat in cyrillic looks like this so and essentially you can say that age is sort of like upside down"
844880,850160," and flipped check um can you just use cyrillic"
850160,858400," it's a good question i can try uh so i literally gonna call it like that"
858400,862640," well i mean it's already inconvenient because every time like at least for me"
862640,870240," at least for me it's already super inconvenient because i have to switch between cyrillic and uh latin all the time"
871680,879120," uh and if i try to do cargo in it uh right contains non-ascii characters non-ascii create names are not"
879120,885280," supported by rust which is kind of surprising to be fair knowing the rust community i would expect them"
885280,891120," to support them at least for emojis in the names of the packages"
891120,904800," i am actually surprised why rust rust developers why don't you support uh utf8 in the in the package"
904800,912080," names right so you could have like a i don't know a joy crying emoji as a package name wouldn't that be cool"
912880,920560," or flushed as a package name i don't know such such a missed opportunity such a missed opportunity"
920560,925600," okay so this is a cargo tomal uh so one of the things right so people were suggesting to call"
925600,932480," this entire thing hat uh right so let's maybe literally rename this entire thing to hat right"
932480,937440," so let's go ahead and rename this entire thing to hat uh right and i don't want to use cyrillic again"
937440,942880," because it's not only can inconvenient for people who don't have cyrillic key uh keyboard it's"
942880,947520," inconvenient for me because i have to constantly switch the layout right so i have two layouts"
947520,953440," simultaneously uh right so now to rename i have to switch layout then type it out and switch it again"
953440,959520," which is really annoying all right so i don't want to be able to do that all the time so i think uh cargo"
959520,966960," also created let's actually remove everything that carpet created uh so and let me see so i think in"
966960,974240," yeah so it created hello world i think in src uh yeah this one so for some reason it created hello world"
974240,980800," right but i mean they're trying to be uh you know user friendly or something cargo in it right so we have a"
980800,988080," hat and hat is probably already taken um so i mean we need we need some sort of a name we need some sort"
988080,997040," of a name uh naming thing is really hard right um so so what's the name of the you know random number"
997040,1006720," generator package in rust is it just random uh i don't quite remember so i remember that rust tls itself"
1006720,1014080," it kind of depends on random right because it's a cryptographical thing uh right so it is in fact a"
1014080,1020240," cryptographical thing maybe it's somewhere in its transitive dependencies so let's actually go ahead"
1020240,1028240," and just cargo add a rust tls and see what kind of stuff we can have in there right so cargo tree so"
1028240,1033760," we have in here so you can't build the tree without downloading all of these things okay there is a get"
1033760,1041120," random i can see that um i can see that um i can see that there is a get random so is that a good package"
1041120,1047040," is that a good uh random package for for rust i don't quite i don't really know creates io"
1047040,1052960," so get random"
1057680,1066080," get random okay so a rust library for returning random data from operating system sources it is"
1066080,1072000," assumed that the system always provides high quality cryptographically secure random data ideally backed"
1072000,1077520," by hardware entropy sources this crate derives its name from linux get random function but is cross"
1077520,1085920," platform roughly supporting the same set of platforms as rust std lip uh so it's like a it's a you know"
1085920,1093280," cryptographical quality source of entropy apparently um so yeah that's pretty cool"
1093280,1099280," let's go ahead and just do cargo add get random"
1099280,1103360," get random"
1103360,1112400," uh so let me okay so something something weird is going on i need to yeah because i renamed the folder now"
1113600,1119360," so uh i have to do it like that so here is the get random uh what i'm thinking is that it probably"
1119360,1125440," makes sense to just go ahead and generate some docs right so i think it's going to be convenient"
1125440,1130880," uh we're going to be trying to study get random through the docs"
1134320,1139120," might want to check out that ring package to see all that safe 100 trust that rust taylor said it has"
1139120,1139440," itself"
1139440,1147040," it's actually very interesting maybe i should do that um so while it's installing things"
1147040,1155440," and building things ring safe fast well i mean they already say that it's safe and it's fast so why"
1155440,1159360," why would you not believe them why would you not believe them why would you not believe them so"
1159360,1163200," it had a repository right so here is the repository"
1166800,1178560," so we're gonna just search for unsafe"
1178560,1187360," are they literally calling to open ssl this vast ls literally depends on"
1187360,1194320," what why are they calling to open ssl if that's supposed to be dropping replacement of open ssl i don't"
1194320,1200320," quite understand what this is going on maybe it's something else maybe um okay"
1200320,1211840," so i see very cool i mean it's not our problem if it's if it's third party dependency right so"
1211840,1218080," third party dependencies are safe and free all the time uh so did it open the the shy set i think"
1218080,1223920," yeah i think it did that's what it did in here so where is my get random motherfucker okay"
1223920,1229680," interface to operating system random number generator so linux uses get random on different"
1229680,1236320," operating system blah blah blah but how do you use this big so there is a function called get"
1236320,1243440," random so you basically take the destination right so fill desk with random bytes from the system"
1243440,1248000," preferred random number source this function returns an error on any failure including"
1248720,1255360," partial reads we make no guarantees regarding the contents of desk on error if this is empty get random"
1255360,1260320," immediately returns success making no calls to the underlying operating system huh"
1260320,1267920," well i mean yeah you should not expect anything on there i suppose"
1270000,1276160," so blocking is possible at least during the early boot c uh module uh documentation okay that seems to be"
1276160,1282320," pretty straightforward uh i don't really see anything particularly difficult or special or anything just"
1282320,1291680," like you go ahead and use that right so just go ahead and use that so use get uh random get random"
1291680,1300240," so this is a single function and get random and maybe we're gonna just have a token so it's gonna be"
1300240,1306560," mutable token right so let's say that it's gonna be a token and how many uh things we want to put in there"
1306560,1311920," like 32 bytes talking is gonna be enough for everyone i'm pretty sure right so it's gonna be enough for"
1311920,1320800," everyone so this is gonna be 32 and let's just do get random and afterwards we can simply print uh this"
1320800,1327040," entire thing so we're gonna print it like in debug mode right we're gonna print in debug mode and just"
1327040,1337440," continue so i'm gonna do cargo build uh so not no target specified in manifest uh yeah i see what is"
1337440,1347120," going on so essentially uh what we want to do um so i plan to have several talk uh binaries in the"
1347120,1352880," project right so basically binary for server binary for client and so on and so forth uh right because of"
1352880,1358560," that i want to actually explicitly say them but i don't remember uh how to do that in cargo right so"
1358560,1366960," several binaries how you do that so let's google that so okay how to build multiple binaries in cargo"
1366960,1371120," right so i know that there is a build name and path okay so that's pretty straightforward"
1371120,1377760," so we have a name so the name is going to be server and the path is basically src server rc"
1378560,1383760," rs not rc sorry okay so we're building things we're building things"
1383760,1392800," okay love it rust experience proper rust experience"
1392800,1403840," we're not even doing anything serious yet but yeah already having fun ready having fun"
1406000,1410960," okay it doesn't fucking compile uh because this thing has to be mutable right so you want to"
1410960,1416240," actually pass it by a mutable reference right so there you go so it complains about some shit oh"
1416240,1422960," yeah because it may fail right so because it may fail we want to actually say something let's say"
1422960,1435680," something pretty mundane uh so eprintln something like this error could not generate a random access token"
1436000,1446000," right so we're also going to put it like this so this is going to be talking and we're building and"
1446000,1450560," let's try to maybe run it so i'm going to cargo around and see let's take a look at the token so"
1450560,1457680," that was a bad idea cargo run uh like this okay so we've got the token uh that's pretty cool uh so maybe"
1458240,1464160," it would be better to do it like that so is it random every time it seems to be random every time"
1464160,1469600," honestly so i think it is in fact random every time one of the things i would like to do i would"
1469600,1477200," like to actually render that token properly all right so as a string or something like that so uh let me"
1477200,1484480," let me see so how can we do that we can iterate through each individual byte and turn that byte into"
1484480,1494080," hexadecimal uh all right so is there any way to do that rust u8 uh into hex right is there easy way to"
1494080,1503600," do that base 64 that shit but that requires like another another package do i really want to install"
1503600,1510000," that i want to okay so there's a hex string and it's also separate package uh right so i just want"
1510000,1521440," to hex right honestly i want to hex uh okay so rust and up okay so you can do it like that with access"
1521440,1528000," but this is for each individual byte might maybe that is fine maybe that is fine and we're writing that"
1528000,1533360," into a string so that's actually a pretty cool idea because a string and rust is implements a"
1533360,1540000," writable interface you can write things into strings uh right so you can write things into string"
1540000,1548640," so uh let's go ahead and try to do that so uh where is my emacs too so i'm going to take token"
1548640,1554720," and i wonder if i can just do it like that so do you have to do iter i don't quite remember but it"
1554720,1562880," doesn't really matter so i'm going to print ln all right and i'm going to say x but i can put i think i can put"
1562880,1567920," x in here right i can put x in here so the reason why i'm doing it like that is because i want to see"
1567920,1573600," if it works or not right i just want okay so that seems to be working but this is a problem i want to"
1573600,1580240," actually uh you know pad that with zeros uh right i want to actually pad that with zeros"
1580240,1585360," okay so thank you so much that's precisely what i needed in here that's pretty cool"
1585360,1601760," so uh yeah we can actually see that and after that i can uh maybe i would call that something like"
1603120,1613920," maybe buffer right so this is buffer and here is the buffer but the token is going to be the separate"
1613920,1621200," string like so it's going to be the separate string like so and i can write into that token specifically"
1621200,1626960," and then i can just you know create that token i don't even have to write it in a debug mode i can just"
1626960,1635120," write it like that uh and that should be more than enough so token we take it by a reference by a"
1635120,1641920," mutable reference okay so it doesn't know that string is in implementation of right because we need to do"
1641920,1650800," that uh which is kind of surprising so fmt yeah okay so that's fine that is actually fine so what else do"
1650800,1660800," we need in here uh the name right is defined multiple times wait a second but really so that is bizarre"
1660800,1667360," method cannot be called on mute string does not satisfy satisfy trade bonds"
1668160,1679360," right right stdio so am i going crazy excuse me uh because in here they showed an example where"
1679360,1686320," you could literally just do that it's a mutable string okay okay okay so i don't see any problems"
1686320,1695920," whatsoever but it doesn't really allow us to do that super easily uh so yes yes yes yes so let me actually"
1695920,1708000," see iowa write versus fmt write rust rust people i swear to god like a conflict uh g maybe i need to read"
1708000,1715760," the output of the compiler a little bit more careful doesn't satisfy this thing uh string doesn't satisfy"
1715760,1725760," right must implement or write fmt method right so the following trait is implemented but not in a scope"
1725760,1731680," use this thing but when i add this entire thing right when i add this entire thing it complains"
1731680,1739920," that there is a previous input of training here we input it here uh uh the other right i used import"
1739920,1747440," blah blah blah blah okay so conflicting imperfect for both recursive try okay so let's see how exactly you"
1747440,1755600," resolve these kind of things so people are discussing uh at the blanket implementation for right so how do"
1755600,1765280," do you resolve this kind of problem so use use so you can use basically you can rename it but just"
1765280,1772320," because i rename it it's not going to fuck it up right so if i understand correctly it is not going to"
1772320,1778000," fuck it okay so they actually suggested that right right so i wasn't sure i didn't notice this entire thing"
1778000,1779600," so i wasn't 100 percent sure"
1779600,1787040," those people had an opportunity to fix all of the problems"
1787040,1794080," yet they managed to introduce even more problems into their language it's just fucking bizarre to me"
1794080,1799120," uh anyway so we can probably ignore this errors uh there we go"
1800640,1807760," fuck me okay so this is all we got this is the secret token and they're talking they were talking"
1807760,1815360," about is it too long it could be a little bit too long right so maybe maybe it is too long so what about"
1816800,1824080," like making it uh maybe a little bit shorter like 32 uh right so we might as well actually get rid of that"
1824080,1830720," and just like use 16 right let me just put it like that and that's the full token right so and every time"
1830720,1837440," it is different every time it is different every time but it's a temporary token so who cares"
1837920,1845440," who cares so i look how many tokens i just leaked look how many tokens i just leaked it's insane right it's"
1845440,1846160," fucking insane"
1846160,1863360," so now we need to somehow we need to somehow pass that to the server right we need to pass that to the server"
1863360,1874080," so we can essentially take the function server take the function server and pass the token there right"
1874080,1881520," so the token is going to be like this token string and uh so we're literally moving that token inside"
1881520,1890480," of the server as we start the um the threat so this is the token so if i just do it like that right and"
1890480,1898720," recompile everything seems to be fine cool so the server now is aware of the token they are aware of"
1898720,1905040," the token but we have to now introduce a state for the client we need to introduce the state of the"
1905040,1913040," client so as soon as the client is connected right we just add this client to the list of clients right"
1913040,1920160," so connections and stuff like that and we read their messages and we broadcast their messages"
1920800,1927360," so but we need to keep track of whether those clients are authenticated are authorized or not"
1927360,1933760," authorized so that's quite important i think uh right so to do that we're going to use um"
1933760,1939520," you know a modern technology modern persistent technology called a boolean right so authorized"
1942320,1951760," it's going to be either false or true uh so authorized that's pretty cool um what's interesting what's"
1951760,1952720," funny is that"
1952720,1962640," we can authorized we can authorize people on the client side"
1962640,1974560," uh that is very interesting because essentially when a client is connected when the client is connected"
1974560,1982240," we spawn a threat and call the client function right so we call the client function uh and interestingly"
1982240,1991360," enough right so we basically start by broadcasting by broadcasting the the client connected what if"
1991360,1998640," in here the first thing we'll do we'll try to read we're not going to broadcast that new connection to"
1998640,2003760," the server threat we're not broadcasting it to the server threat here right in the client we're going to"
2003760,2011200," read something uh like the stuff from the client and check whether it's a token and if it's not a"
2011200,2016320," token we're going to close that connection so the server threat never knows that there was a new"
2016320,2024800," connection whatsoever that's a very interesting thing right that way by the way that way we don't even"
2024800,2031520," have to introduce a boolean in here right because if the client not authorized if the clown no uh clown"
2031520,2039920," if the clown not authorized uh the server is never going to know uh the server cloud application"
2041200,2064320," the circus clown architecture holy shit why is this so fucking fine the circus clown architecture"
2064320,2075360," what kind of partners do you use in your application the circus clown architecture"
2075360,2079840," hmm"
2079840,2087040," uh cca yeah the tech to look for in 2024 yeah circus clown architecture"
2090320,2095520," and that's what we're doing today right circus clown architecture so we should rename this to circus"
2095520,2102240," right circus and that function to the clown so it's just like a single circus a bunch of clowns"
2102240,2105520," and it even makes sense i think it even makes sense"
2105520,2111520," clown services yeah"
2114000,2118880," uh let's go ahead and try to do that but that means the server should not know about"
2118880,2127520," luta can the server must not know about luta can uh so it's the client that is supposed to know about"
2127520,2134320," luta can right so we have to pass that again in there but since we're going to have several luta cans"
2134320,2141360," several luta cans we probably uh can't really move it right so it's not going to be string because string is"
2141360,2147600," going to move into this thing so we need to pass it by a reference um i wonder if just using this"
2147600,2156480," constant reference is okay right because we are working with a piece of memory that is going to have"
2156480,2163200," a lot of readers but nobody is going to be modifying that i think that's a reasonable thing to do like i"
2163200,2169360," don't feel like we need arc arc is kind of needed like if you want to modify that but like so"
2169360,2177360," yeah we'll see let's actually give it a try let's actually give it a try so i'm gonna just like do a"
2177360,2182560," token in here right so i'm going to talk in here and try to compile that this is going to compile uh"
2182560,2188800," right so server yeah yeah so this one is absolute you can't do that anymore uh and what do we have in"
2188800,2195840," here so token uh so we didn't use it in here so that's just a warning and in here so closure may"
2195840,2203360," outlive the current function but okay how can it outlive the current function it's a main function"
2205600,2215360," does rust in its model has an idea that uh main is not going to uh like threats are not going to"
2215360,2224480," outlive main function or how does it work right so technically no it doesn't yes so vizar knows exactly"
2224480,2231440," what i'm talking about right so it it doesn't have any okay so it's not part of the rust model of"
2231440,2237600," safety and scopes and stuff like that it's not part of that uh right so"
2237600,2246720," that is that is annoying that is annoying like oh my god"
2246720,2249200," fuck"
2249200,2256720," people are suggesting to leak it right people are suggesting to leak it but i mean"
2257440,2265760," okay i can do static right uh i can do static but that means i have to do that inside of the buffer"
2265760,2270640," oh i can't do that do static i just can't do it statically"
2270640,2284640," the string is small chat the string is small right so how long of a string this is i mean come on 32"
2285840,2295760," i'm pretty sure it's 32 like come on brother can't we copy 32 bytes in 2023"
2295760,2299520," it's it's 32 bytes guys"
2299520,2308560," right we we don't need reference counting to pass 32 bytes between the goddamn threads"
2309280,2317520," we can just do that chat come on i know you like to over engineer chat but we're passing 32 bytes to a"
2317520,2318160," different thread"
2324080,2338560," too much memory"
2338560,2346560," look at it look at it look at it keep looking at it while i'm pouring myself a cup of water"
2346560,2360080," so what do we have uh let's try to compile with big"
2360080,2367040," so let okay so it's unused uh so i'll just put it in here"
2370240,2384800," so token closure may are"
2390240,2394880," all right"
2394880,2403120," what was that get random that's right so okay we passed the token to the client right so we passed"
2403120,2409120," the token to the client and one of the things we can try to do now by the way we can try to do we can"
2409120,2418080," try to read exactly 32 bytes we can we should try to read exactly 32 bytes uh so"
2419760,2424880," is it going to include like a new line or something but we'll see uh so token"
2424880,2434320," you know what i'm thinking what if we had like uh authorize out to arise uh and we're gonna pass"
2434320,2438560," the stream in there we're gonna pass the stream in there and we're gonna pass the token in there"
2438560,2448240," uh right and yeah where where where am i because i've all of a sudden just lost like where am i uh so"
2448240,2454560," this is going to be the token and uh stuff like that so if not authorize"
2454560,2457920," just freaking return like so"
2457920,2463600," is that how we do that yeah i think i think that's how we do that so we're supposed to even do it like"
2463600,2469040," that um honestly we might even do something like authorize"
2469360,2477840," this yeah so authorize may even return uh authorize authorize i set"
2477840,2482960," uh results this thing"
2482960,2493200," so you see i can do to do so we just do authorize and if it failed we're gonna log something in there"
2493200,2495680," saying that uh we could not authorize"
2495680,2499440," stop fucking mocking me"
2499440,2507920," so and uh it will just basically short circuit the entire thing and just quit right so that's basically"
2507920,2517360," the idea in here but we also need to accept stream uh arc by the way so if i wanna this will"
2517360,2523040," effectively move this entire thing but i don't want to move it but i also don't want to clone it"
2523040,2531600," is that a thing that people do is like do people pass arcs by a reference like immutable reference"
2534400,2550400," um okay oh yeah thank you Moscow uh so yeah but we can probably do it like that sure so it makes"
2550400,2556240," sense to me i suppose and we can have a token which is just that so that's pretty cool and here i can do"
2556240,2561520," as a ref i suppose maybe it could be done automatically we'll see if it can do it automatically i don't"
2561520,2569120," really know russ right so we can do like that so okay so here we can pre-allocate some buff on"
2569120,2576640," the buffer so and the buffer is going to consist of 32 characters right so it's going to be u8 32"
2576640,2583280," and it's going to be 0 32 one of the things we want to do we want to read uh is this how you read"
2583280,2591040," let me see how you usually read yeah yeah yeah so you do stream read mutable buffer you want to keep"
2591040,2600320," it mutable that's for sure you want to keep it mutable and so let me let me see so it may also return"
2600320,2609120," an error uh it may error and in that case we want to do map error so this is error and we're gonna say"
2612000,2617920," interestingly interestingly interestingly interestingly for the login purposes we'll probably need the outer"
2617920,2630960," addr right we'll need the outer addr can we just do this thing a little bit up there right and pass the"
2630960,2639040," outer addr like this it would make sense to maybe pass it by a reference right so we don't copy it or anything"
2639040,2646720," like that uh right so here it is addr and i think it's a socket addr all of that is by reference all of"
2646720,2654160," that is by reference so in here we're going to say error uh could not read out then uh out and"
2654160,2667200," authorization authorization token from addr because of that stupid thing so maybe we also need to mark these"
2667200,2674320," things as sensitive so addr is sensitive i i renamed sensitive to sense because it was taking too much"
2674320,2680400," too many characters i was too lazy to actually type it so it's now sense so it's just it's just sent but"
2680400,2687600," maybe maybe maybe it's just easier to do it like that it's a sense does it look cool to chat tell me"
2687600,2693360," that all this looks cool right i just say this is a sensitive stuff right now makes"
2693360,2702320," you guys are very fun thank you so much i really appreciate you all uh right so we read some stuff in"
2702320,2710640," there we read some stuff in there and i suppose uh this entire thing also returns how much stuff we read"
2710640,2719920," right how much stuff we read and in here we probably need to check if n is less than 32 maybe we can even"
2719920,2726720," say buffalo um that kind of fucked it up a little bit so we didn't read enough"
2726720,2731760," or maybe somebody's trying to slow loris us"
2731760,2738240," somebody's trying to slow loris that in that case you we're gonna close the connection"
2739200,2750160," and everything so um yeah so if it's less we're gonna say um um how to say that"
2750160,2757040," um well i mean it also can return zero in case if it's like closed or broken or something like that"
2757040,2763920," uh banned at mf2 well i mean we're not in a place where we can ban that amount that's the problem"
2763920,2771040," we're not in a place where we can ban that though interestingly interestingly we could in like we can"
2771040,2775760," ban uh people on the server side but not on the client side because we don't have that structure"
2775760,2785920," uh but we could extend the message type uh in a message and we can say ban uh and just pass an ap in"
2785920,2796160," there right so what is that i think ipad yeah ipaddr right we can basically introduce a message and let"
2796160,2804480," the clients without connecting the uh the new clients just ban certain ips right away"
2804480,2813520," so we could try to do something like that but i mean i don't really want to go into that yet so it's"
2813520,2819600," one of the solutions that we can have uh what if someone mistyped you're not supposed to type it you're"
2819600,2835840," supposed to copy paste it you're supposed to copy paste all right so who types tokens excuse me who types"
2835840,2852720," these tokens smh my age anyway uh so now the rights uh so how can we say that uh didn't fully read the"
2852720,2863520," authorization uh token didn't fully read the authorization token and essentially we can press like n we can return"
2863520,2869840," and in here and in this specific case what we can do we can just shut down this thing uh all right so"
2869840,2878880," stream shut down how do we usually shut down thing i can steal some stuff from here uh all right so map"
2878880,2889600," shut down both we're shut down both read and write uh and map error error like so"
2891200,2899040," that could not uh could not uh could not shut down uh addr well i mean we can put it like this"
2899040,2907760," because of that sense iddr can you see you can see sense error there we go and in here"
2907760,2912960," well in in that case we we're still going to do that um we can just ignore it for now"
2912960,2919520," right because it doesn't really matter if we couldn't do that right so we can just like log it didn't"
2919520,2927840," fully read the authorization token only this amount of bytes it's only this amount of bytes and then we"
2927840,2935760," just return error nothing all right as soon as we've got everything right as soon as we got everything we"
2935760,2944400," can uh essentially take buffer from zero to n right so and that's basically the slice uh that we can turn"
2944400,2957200," into this thing so from utf 8 right so but can we can we do that from utf 8 where is the documentation"
2957200,2961520," where is the documentation so i don't want to close this one because i think it's useful"
2961520,2971120," so let's go ahead and do rust up doc uh super super quick rust up doc uh api"
2971120,2986000," so and uh from utf 8 can you do that str uh come on you can do that so and it returns the result right it"
2986000,2996320," returns the result oh right so um so user token it's going to be like this map error"
3000320,3018320," um um so uh token is not a valid youtube is not a valid utf 8 all right so we're going to put error"
3018320,3025280," in here and that's about it so we're going to just do it like that and afterwards what we have to do"
3025280,3033120," essentially is just compare these things user token right user token uh is equal to token right and if"
3033120,3041040," it's not right if it's not what we can do is essentially just log uh user provided invited"
3041040,3047680," token right user provided well i mean on every of these things we have to do the shutdown"
3048560,3059440," we have to do the shutdown which actually hints to a very interesting thing uh what if we move it outside"
3059440,3069440," of authorize right what if we move it outside of authorize so we can do map error uh like so error"
3069440,3075440," well i mean in that case we know that it's going to be this thing and we can just move that entire shutdown"
3076240,3083680," there literally and we don't have to do that anywhere else that's pretty cool i think so"
3083680,3092800," yeah there we go so it's going to be return that then return that and then uh user provided invited"
3092800,3102240," token uh and we just return error like so and at the end of this entire thing we just return okay like so"
3102240,3106240," so that's the entire authentication essentially right so that's the entire indication"
3106240,3111680," so not storing tokens assaulted hashes maybe it would make sense to actually do that"
3111680,3120320," right so to not leak them but i mean it's a temporary solution right so we're not even passing them over"
3120320,3130160," uh a secure connection either so we have bigger problem than you think so uh so actually salting them and"
3130160,3136640," hashing them won't solve the the fact that we're sending them over an encrypted connection so so"
3136640,3140080," why do you need to reforce it like just do man in the middle so"
3140080,3152240," um all right so this is authorization this is that uh and so here we're explaining what exactly is"
3152240,3157600," happening so here then after that we're shutting down the the entire stream do we need to do anything"
3157600,3165760," else i think that's basically fine right so that's basically fine okay um so let me let me see so is"
3165760,3172000," it built okay so let's go through the completion errors so this is an address not in the scope ah okay"
3172000,3184160," so this is the uh author addr right so this is the alpha addr uh and the buffer uh so expected but"
3184160,3192240," found okay so you want like taking the reference in here and a stream okay so apparently you need to do as a ref in here so i thought maybe it will automatically convert this into stuff but it didn't"
3192240,3207360," uh cannot borrow as mutable uh and read must be mutable right read must be mutable but can i just do it like that then"
3208960,3216560," right type differ as can i do mute ref right i cannot borrow it as mute ref"
3216560,3226240," so that's a little bit sad yeah so down there we're doing as a ref and read but we can't pass it like that"
3226240,3236240," yikes yikes yikes yikes but we can do it right that so apparently there's no other way except"
3237120,3241360," okay chat debated me yet again like listening to chat"
3241360,3251280," listening to chat am i right listening to chat jesus christ why are you guys keep actually debating"
3251280,3259600," me into that and by the way we can try the idea of passing it by this sort of reference listen yeah"
3259600,3266080," exactly like why i keep listening to the chat like i don't know because it's like a chat is like a gpt model"
3266080,3270880," like you look at the chat and the combination of characters that they put in there it kind of makes"
3270880,3277040," sense so it sounds plausible so you're thinking okay i can try that but every time you try that it's"
3277040,3280160," fucking like it's like"
3283840,3298080," uh all right so can we do as a rep uh and yeah and my idea worked and my idea worked of course i tried"
3298080,3309200," the chats idea it didn't fucking work my idea just worked of course of course why i keep listening to the"
3309200,3315040," the chat why i keep listening to the chat i don't freaking know i don't freaking know maybe because i like you guys"
3319520,3326240," anyway so um"
3326240,3326400," uh"
3326400,3328000," uh let's continue let's continue"
3328000,3330160," uh"
3330160,3336080," so are humans equivalent to sophisticated lms when in large enough quantities maybe"
3336080,3344400," probably probably probably probably to be fair yes because as far as now llms they're not"
3346160,3350240," really being intelligent in a classical sense"
3350240,3360320," what they're doing they're modeling conversation between hypothetical ai and the person except every"
3360320,3368240," time they want to model what the person should say it's forcibly substituted what with what you actually said"
3369920,3372240," right"
3372240,3378480," so essentially uh right so you have an ai message right so the whatever you generated then the human"
3378480,3382720," uh right and then it's substituted with your message"
3382720,3390000," right with your message and then this prefix is given to the language model and it continues right"
3390000,3395280," it continues writing its uh its words words words but what's interesting is that"
3396000,3401680," theoretically uh it may continue writing your message"
3401680,3409200," it may try to continue write uh your message it's just like the uh the system into which the model is"
3409200,3415920," embedded forcefully does not allow to do that and forcefully substitutes that thing with your message"
3415920,3423040," all the time right but it can continue it can model what you say it can even predict what you would say"
3423040,3427760," and this is something that you could see for example in search engines like bings or something like that"
3427760,3433600," when you have conversation with bing have you noticed that it also suggests you what you can answer to the"
3433600,3439360," model this is because it's the same model predicted what you would say and they decided to embed that"
3439360,3449840," into the ux right so it in fact uh it uh doesn't view itself as an ai it just models the conversation of two entities"
3449840,3456720," except the message of one entity is constantly substituted in fact technically it can"
3456720,3463920," model the conversation of two ais the same the same model it doesn't care it can model as many"
3463920,3470320," conversation over conversation of as many entities as as possible and in that sense when you have several"
3470320,3477040," uh like people like enough quantity of people they do act like llm because it's several entities"
3477040,3481520," constantly converse conversing with each other and i guess the answer could be yes maybe"
3483360,3494000," uh so yeah so the i suppose like chat gpt doesn't view itself as chat gpt it just models the conversation"
3494000,3497120," right so that's basically uh"
3497120,3505040," so yeah it could model the conversation of as many as you'd like with uh degrading quotes"
3507120,3517600," um so this is how at least i understand how language models works so i'm not really you know an expert"
3517600,3522800," in the field uh right but they're just modeling the conversation so it's a mathematical model of"
3522800,3528800," conversation on the internet right not only in the internet but it's well i mean it's specifically"
3528800,3535360," fine to tune in case of chat gpt it's specifically fine-tune and tweak to be um a mathematical model of the"
3535360,3545040," the conversation of you with chat gpt right as weird as it sounds llm behind chat gpt is a mathematical"
3545040,3549600," model of conversation between you and chat gpt right so"
3549600,3558080," uh yeah recursive definitions i know but i mean that's the definition that makes the most sense to me"
3558080,3565280," because uh it's not a raw language model right so they took uh and trained unsupervised language model"
3565280,3572320," like huge language model but then they fine-tuned it to act uh to work better on modeling the"
3572320,3578480," conversations between users and the chat gpt so it's just fine-tuned and refined to behave in a"
3578480,3584160," certain way right it's not a raw uh language model rolling which models like in a while they're very"
3584160,3592640," very dangerous they're they unaligned i guess they can say n-word for instance very very dangerous"
3595200,3606720," um so let's continue so uh all right so everything seems to be compiling so we need to test how this"
3606720,3613520," entire shise is going to work so you know what by the way i feel like we should say something to do to"
3613520,3622240," the user when they fucked up right uh i think uh yeah could not read authorization token so if this error has"
3622240,3629120," happened that's fine that's fine we don't care about that uh here um we can we could probably say"
3629120,3634640," something right we could probably say something in on all of these things right so we could probably say"
3634640,3640640," something on all of these things uh but we probably want to say something in here right so let's actually"
3640640,3651360," do it like that stream stream right uh maybe we can do in some something like this right ln um invalid uh token"
3651360,3653840," right invalid token"
3656560,3666400," so yes so yes so yes so so stream that's something we can easily do i have a feeling that maybe not"
3670480,3687360," uh could not send i could not notify client about invalid"
3687360,3696000," token uh we can say which client so it's specifically author addr and we can say the error you can't see"
3696000,3702480," shit you can see shit now uh right so this is gonna sense out there addr sense"
3702480,3712720," error there we go to get this thing and we don't really care if it succeeds or not uh right so we just"
3712720,3719840," like say invalid token we'll log if something went wrong just in case right and then we shut it down"
3719840,3724640," right so but we don't short circuit anything any of the execution or anything like that we just like"
3724640,3729440," fire and forget right but log just in case so you can troubleshoot that later if you want to"
3729440,3738240," uh right so send sense yeah very funny so here we're borrowing as mutable right so"
3739200,3744320," as a rep can i can i can do as a rep yeah i can yeah boy boy"
3744320,3756240," very cool yeah very cool again um so and another thing that probably would make sense"
3756240,3763200," let's actually first to write to the user right stream as a rep"
3765040,3774560," so token yeah that's a good idea right so that's a good idea um so if we yeah"
3774560,3781680," should i ignore or should we report this into i think as well"
3784080,3790000," so"
3790000,3791040," so"
3791040,3792400," so"
3792400,3793440," um"
3793440,3793600," um"
3793600,3795120," send uh token"
3795120,3796240," prompt"
3796240,3798080," to"
3798080,3800720," that because of that sense"
3800720,3803440," author addr sense"
3803440,3809440," and should we short circuit this entire thing"
3810400,3814720," maybe not uh i think i'm gonna let it fall through right i'm gonna let it fall through"
3814720,3821040," and authorization is going to just do the rest of this entire thing all right so uh let's go ahead"
3821040,3826640," and just like run this entire thing so here's the token that's pretty cool so uh yeah we connect"
3826640,3834720," it and everything so telnet uh 27001 6969 token provide the token so what we do we can actually put"
3834720,3841600," this thing in here and uh yeah so do we connect we actually connect i think we need to uh notify the"
3841600,3847360," user that they successfully authorized i think that's quite important right so um"
3847360,3854480," okay e-print uh actually print ln something like this uh info um"
3856720,3867600," authorized authorized authorized and this is a sense uh out uh author addr and we can also do writer lan"
3867600,3873120," stream as a ref um"
3873120,3876720," welcome to the club"
3876720,3879520," to the club"
3883680,3887520," welcome to the club buddy i'm sorry um so"
3887520,3891920," okay"
3891920,3907040," so yeah more to d time i forgot what it is uh the like quote of the day or message of the day yeah"
3907040,3910480," wanted you so we can have a message of the day that's for sure yeah"
3911600,3923280," um why did you rewrote it in rust uh because rust people pay more because rust people pay more so if"
3923280,3930800," you check out the today command there is a tweet so there is actual data to back it up so if you"
3930800,3938080," program a rust like literally on twitch you're gonna make more money like factually backed by the research"
3938080,3944400," backed by the data so yeah that's why you're wrong"
3944400,3953360," so okay so e-print lan uh error could not send"
3953360,3964960," uh could not send welcome message to that because of that sense sometimes i feel like maybe i'm being overly"
3964960,3972160," cautious with these logs uh but maybe not because you never know what kind of stuff could be useful"
3972160,3975120," when the shed hits the final right like you never know"
3976640,3982160," right so i'm not probably not gonna short circuit in here right so we're not gonna short circuit in"
3982160,3988960," here so we're gonna do in here um all right so whatever we have here okay so let's restart this"
3988960,3994480," entire stuff and now i'm gonna do tell nothing to that so it asks for the token i provide the token"
3994480,4002480," uh welcome to the club buddy hello uh right so and interestingly let's actually take a look at the"
4002480,4011840," situation when uh like we didn't do that correctly right so let me see so uh let's do tell net"
4011840,4018400," so connection invalid token right so you can do that invalid token"
4018400,4024800," right so invalid token and we can try to ban people on a certain thing"
4025440,4031200," all right we can try to ban people but that will require at least for the"
4031200,4040080," for the client threat to has to have its own hash table uh right so to have its own hash table that"
4040080,4048080," is going to ban people uh but yeah but yeah but yeah but yeah but yeah and what's interesting is that rate"
4048080,4056960," limited thingy is actually after the authentication right so that's what another problem that we have"
4056960,4067040," it is out after authentication i think uh rate limiting stuff rate limiting stuff should be uh actually"
4067040,4073120," before authentication it must be before authentication"
4073840,4079920," so and that means it has to be on the server threat and stuff like that so yeah that means"
4079920,4083760," we'll have to rewrite all that but i mean we already kind of have like a working thing in here"
4083760,4090800," so let's let's give it a try okay guys so what i'm gonna do i'm gonna simply go ahead and commit"
4090800,4096400," whatever we have already and we're gonna try to test that right so we're gonna share the token only to"
4096400,4104160," the uh users in the in the discord right so who have the voice and stuff like that and uh hopefully i'll be"
4104160,4114240," able to safely show the uh the thing on the on the on the stream right so okay uh let me see so"
4118320,4126960," introduce introduce simple simple out then authorization i don't remember i still don't"
4126960,4131840," remember what's the difference between authentication and authorization i think what we're doing we're"
4131840,4139680," doing authentication right so we're doing authentication authorization is checking whether you have enough"
4139680,4145600," permissions to do something right so i think that's the difference right so what we're doing here is"
4145600,4152240," authentication authorization authorization has permissions yeah authentication is who say"
4152240,4158480," you are yeah we're doing authentication actually i'm using this term incorrectly so cut them but i mean"
4158480,4165520," it's a kind of a subtle difference honestly it's a kind of a subtle difference because you can ask"
4165520,4170320," you are who you are with the sole purpose of checking the permissions right so it's kind of"
4171280,4177360," yeah it's kind of like a very you know modeled definition so that's why probably why people confuse"
4177360,4185280," it so often right so that's probably the reason so introduce a simple authorization uh via a random"
4185280,4190640," token right so this is a random token and i'm going to push that right into the repo by the way in the"
4190640,4197200," future when we introduce the client right so i'm going to push new versions of the client and the server"
4197200,4202720," into the repo so you will be able to maybe fetch the latest client and use the latest client uh to connect"
4202720,4210400," and stuff like that so um they confuse so often because it sounds the same well yeah it sounds almost"
4210400,4217040," the same and it also has like a very close meaning so it's just like it's it it's bound to be confused"
4217040,4224800," right so it's basically designed to be confused so did we already push this entire stuff uh i think i think we did"
4224800,4231920," all right so let me ssh into your mom slowly carefully as ascension into your mom"
4231920,4239040," got scared a little bit like you saw that delay you saw the delay i got really scared maybe like"
4239040,4241360," it's it's already hacked by somebody so who knows"
4243440,4250160," okay uh so let me see and i'm gonna do for at and i'm gonna fetch the latest changes"
4250160,4261760," like this it merge origin master uh it's not master it's main okay whatever uh so we have some changes ah"
4261760,4270800," okay so git checkout uh server rs right so i basically said the safe mode right so i said the safe mode so let's"
4270800,4275840," actually merge this thing okay so now what we have instead we have a full cargo application so we can"
4275840,4282560," now remove the server and we probably have to build this entire thing uh all right so yeah of course we"
4282560,4285840," also need to download all the dependencies on the on the server sure"
4285840,4296160," will also autocannon your mom or is that too much what is autocannon what is autocannon is that like a"
4296160,4301120," stress testing utility or something like that it sounds familiar but i can't remember what it is"
4301120,4307520," it's a utility for stress testing right it's a utility for stress testing bench utility oh okay so"
4307520,4316640," um all right so let me go into maybe not i think not right so why if i if we have the chat"
4318320,4325360," all right so this is going to be server rs and uh so this is going to be safe mode let me put it to true"
4325360,4333520," all right so i'm going to do cargo run and not run build we're going to build it first"
4334560,4350000," uh okay go so i need the ip i need the ip so i'm going to go to uh ssh config so this is the ip"
4351200,4362640," uh i'm going to copy paste the ip to the secret place on discord right so this is the ip uh 69 69 so"
4362640,4371680," telnet maybe i'm going to even do something like console right so this is a console uh so this is how"
4371680,4386480," how we're supposed to use this entire thing okay okay so this is going to be that and uh i suppose am i"
4386480,4395680," where am i by the way so i think i'm i'm local right so i'm currently local all right i am in fact local"
4396560,4402560," uh okay so i already moved this entire thing on to a different machine right so i already moved this"
4402560,4406720," entire thing to a different machine and i'm gonna do cargo run"
4406720,4421360," so i can already see people are connecting but the token is unknown the token has been posted in the chat"
4426560,4434000," okay all right hopefully we're not going to have anything like 2tos and friendly and stuff but yeah"
4434000,4441360," uh so what is that your mom hey hey uh it's a me"
4441360,4451200," zozin right so it's kind of interesting how many people we could have in here so what the fuck is that"
4454160,4461920," what are you doing all this right so still not banned huh that's very interesting uh all right"
4461920,4468240," so not that many people are trying to authorize anymore so we have a couple of things like"
4468240,4474000," not fully authorized message typing is annoying as far i know i know i know uh it is if in fact"
4474000,4478880," annoying but this is because we don't have like a separate client uh right we don't really have a"
4478880,4489840," separate client uh so yeah you can do you can do user too uh right so kind of cool all right so the"
4489840,4496720," conversation seems to be saying so that means the token is working so the token is working uh"
4496720,4502000," so i think it will be great to add nicknames i do agree with that right so"
4502000,4502400," so oh"
4502400,4509520," emotes what the fuck my terminal actually supports emotes"
4509520,4518960," that's pretty cool like what i'm using i'm using st right so if anyone is interested right so it's just"
4518960,4529920," from suckless uh reductive"
4529920,4537280," all right i love it okay so uh i guess this kind of tasting is a little bit more sane right so uh i"
4537280,4542720," disconnected everyone i disconnected everyone so that's pretty cool okay thank you everyone for testing"
4543680,4550240," so and now the big reveal that was the token and this information is now useless for you because"
4550240,4555520," the next time we're going to generate a new one so it doesn't matter if i just leaked it so yeah there"
4555520,4563760," we go uh so that's basically the idea right so every time we run i get this feeling and every time"
4563760,4571840," i guess i swear i could fly that that's basically how authentication works so uh so it's a new token every"
4571840,4578480," single time so how do you join the secret channels well you have to be subscribed to"
4578480,4584880," to twitch and stuff like this and stuff like that all right that's pretty cool i'm surprised that st"
4584880,4589840," supports emotes because st if you take a look at the source code of the steel let's actually see uh st"
4589840,4603840," suckless uh right so suckless i'm served but"
4603840,4606160," okay"
4614160,4618080," secretly stop can you be secretly stop can you be secretly stop uh i don't really know"
4618080,4631840," so just a second they still have this bug when i press like right click when i press right click"
4631840,4642480," so i now have to open pcmnfm which may take some time because i think they recently migrated to gtk3 and all"
4642480,4648880," the gtk3 applications are super slow for me no i think pcmn yeah yeah so they're still using gt2"
4648880,4654160," but it's like i can see that from the theme in here so i have to press this thing in here and only then"
4654160,4660560," i'll be able to finally press right thing in here there's so many freaking bugs in chromium"
4660560,4668640," right so it's the first bug is with the pop-up that i experience all the time the second bug is um losing the"
4668640,4675520," anchor position when the resizing and these are like very old bugs and it don't like nobody's"
4675520,4681360," going to fix them it's it's the same as with that old like 21 year old bug in firefox right so it's just"
4681360,4689440," like a such a uh such an obscure real minor bug that nobody gives a shit uh all right because that's"
4689440,4695200," the that's the idea anyway so let's actually download this thing so this is the st so if you've never seen"
4695200,4702080," st right so uh i'm gonna unpack it right so i already unpacked it and that's the entirety of"
4702080,4705920," the source code of st and if you want to build it uh"
4705920,4711520," that's it it's it's built the entirety of the terminal has been built"
4712400,4721280," the entirety of it so and we can take a look at its clock right so i'm supposed to put dot in here"
4721280,4731040," so it's 4 000 lines of c code i guess you can implement such terminal 4 000 lines right so if"
4731040,4736880," you don't implement all the possible like escape sequences and stuff like that right so and what's"
4736880,4743840," funny is that if you run this specific version like it looks like this uh it looks like this and there"
4743840,4748720," is no config to customize it but there is config.h"
4748720,4758640," yes so the way you customize it you modify config.h and you refucking build this entire thing"
4760720,4766400," so and then you run it again and there you go you just reconfigured it like you just increase the size"
4766400,4766880," of the phone"
4766880,4777840," so that's so cool actually i really like that so yeah and but i configured it to look like this right so it"
4777840,4783440," also has a zoom in and zoom out automatic but uh like for me i had to reconfigure it slightly different"
4783440,4790640," things so uh you can actually go to config.h right and if you just search for zoom there we go so here"
4790640,4799120," is the zoom and you literally use the x11 key codes in here for like you know shortcuts and everything"
4799120,4806240," what i did i think i did like plus and i think when i press shift it's underscore right so underscore"
4807280,4813360," something like this if i try to compile this and typing now i think it will compile right and then"
4813360,4820080," it's going to be st and now i can increase the size actually it increases kind of slowly so one"
4820080,4828640," thing i can do is instead of doing plus one and minus one i can do plus two and minus two in here and"
4828640,4834960," rebuild it again like it's kind of a convenient way of configuring this thing it's and the configuration"
4834960,4840160," itself is kind of self-explanatory right you just like look around you can assign different colors"
4840160,4845200," and shit right so and all of that is going to work so now it works a little bit better it actually"
4845200,4852080," zooms in and zooms out very quickly and that zoom in zoom out feature is crucial for me as you can see"
4852080,4855760," on the stream because that's what i do all the time because sometimes i'm going to zoom in to"
4855760,4861280," show on something right so uh yeah and it's just like yeah provides also i really like the"
4861280,4867280," responsiveness of the terminal it's fucking insane especially if you use vim right so on vim it's so"
4867280,4874800," fucking cool like you can't probably see that but i can feel it right so it's just like oh my god it's"
4874800,4884160," so i wish my emex was as responsive as vim in st holy fuck i love it so much it's so it's so cool and"
4884160,4889680," it handles calls correctly so yeah i could not recommend it more like it's it's a really cool terminal so i'm"
4889680,4895200," gonna even put it in the in the description and references and stuff like that so descriptions and"
4895200,4905920," references so st suckless um less lines less response time yeah yes we use you soon okay i'm already"
4905920,4911520," streaming for one and half an hour and uh i think i need to make a break i need to refill my cup of tea"
4912080,4919280," right refill my cup of tea cup of tea and everything and after that break we are going to continue"
4919280,4922640," developing these things while on the break i'm going to also think what we're going to do next"
4922640,4931440," right so um we'll see we'll see maybe we're gonna jump towards encrypted connection right we can take a"
4931440,4939120," look into the rust tls or i heard the creator of curl call it russells right is is that the official"
4939120,4948080," pronunciation of rust tls uh i think it's pronounced like russells or something like that uh so yeah i"
4948080,4951120," i don't think they i didn't see where they officially stayed"
4951120,4955680," don't forget to prepare keys for kgb"
4955680,4967920," anyway so let's make some break um all right so um what i want to do what's going to be the next step"
4967920,4978400," uh what's going to be the next epic step right now our authentication is inside out right so it's kind of"
4978400,4987200," weird how it works because uh first layer that we have we have authentication right out and uh hours"
4987200,4995440," right let's call it out then we have rate limit right we have rate limit and um i would even say"
4997280,5009200," ban ban uh band limit rate limit um text filtering right text filtering uh and only then the like"
5009200,5017440," broadcasting uh casting to users right broadcasting to users so this is the sort of layers of protections"
5017440,5025600," you have to go through to get to the broadcasting uh to the users right broadcasting of messages right so"
5025600,5032320," you send the message you have to get through all these sort of layers and that is kind of weird right"
5032320,5041840," especially ban limit being after the authentication right so essentially um first of all you are not"
5041840,5046400," rate limited at the stage of asking for a token"
5046400,5053680," right you're not rate limited so you can actually spam tokens and you're not going to be banned"
5054560,5061200," you're not going to be banned if you get banned uh at broadcasting the messages right if you get banned"
5061200,5067280," at broadcasting the messages it will still ask you for authentication you will be authenticated and"
5067280,5074880," only then it will tell you that you're banned so i have a feeling that the layers of protections"
5074880,5082080," layers of filters should be roughly like this right so first of all when you connect you checked that you're"
5082080,5090880," you're banned if you're banned go away you're banned a math that's it then okay uh we go into asking the"
5090880,5097520," token right um and if you start spamming random tokens and stuff like that very quickly you're rate"
5097520,5102400," limited so rate limit should still apply to the authentication as well and also we should check"
5102400,5107600," whether you didn't put any garbage in there though even if you put some garbage we'll already have that"
5107600,5113920," like a little bit in there so i feel like it has to be something like that all right so it has to be"
5113920,5120640," something like that out ban yeah so it it's weird right it shouldn't be like that i think it shouldn't"
5120640,5127600," be like that it's just like it was easy to implement it like that right now but what we need is something"
5127600,5137440," like this what we need is something like this um all right so and once you're authorized this is broadcasting"
5137440,5144800," of the messages so uh let's spend the rest of the time of the stream uh let's spend the rest of the"
5144800,5150720," time of the stream that we don't really have that much left uh on uh basically implementing that right"
5150720,5159120," taking this authentication layer and moving it like to here moving it to here so uh let me let me see"
5159120,5166720," how we can do that so we are in mutualizer right so this is not the right correct project uh right so"
5166720,5175840," so where am i it's called for at uh oh it's uh we were in i forgot that we're in him please think"
5175840,5181360," okay uh so i forgot that we're in a synthetic"
5181360,5191040," so now i'm gonna go into the server uh and essentially what i feel we have to do"
5191920,5198560," we have to get rid of this authentication authorization whatever the fuck it is uh from"
5198560,5205840," the client right as soon as the client connects we just add it to the server and that's basically it"
5205840,5211200," right so we don't do any of that stuff just like uh add it to the server so i'm gonna even remove this"
5211200,5221280," entire stuff uh though i wanna keep the whole um you know prompt thingy we're gonna be moving it somewhere"
5221280,5228560," else right so as of right now i'm gonna just like comment it out uh it's not gonna be used anymore"
5228560,5234560," right so the first thing we do when the client is connected we take its address the outer address"
5234560,5242480," then we send the fact of connection to the server threat and we continue as usual and we continue as"
5242480,5250080," usual so the client is actually very um you know lightweight thread that just like relays the messages to"
5250080,5256080," the server and the server does the rest of the stuff uh right within the server within the server"
5256080,5262800," when the client is connected this is where we're going to be doing the authentication stuff this is"
5262800,5267440," where we're going to be doing because you see the client connected the first thing we do we check if"
5267440,5276800," that mf is banned as we should you just connect are you ban mf you're bad enough get the out so that's"
5276800,5283920," precisely what we do in here uh right so we're also checking whether the the ban has been expired and not"
5283920,5290880," expired and everything's fine uh we are connected and i suppose this is where we have to perform the"
5290880,5297200," authentication this is where we have to perform authentication so that means when it has to be very much"
5297200,5308480," stateful uh right so we need to uh introduce something like author authentic uh out out right so by default"
5308480,5315600," this thing is not out right so it's going to be false and this is where we're gonna send to the client"
5315600,5322800," send to the client uh please tell me the token thank you very much so this is where we're going to put that"
5322800,5327680," right so we added the client into the list of connections so this is the list of connection now"
5327680,5332160," and this is where we're going to tell it please provide the token otherwise i'm not going to relay"
5332160,5339840," your messages to the rest of the users it's a good thing so we're finally uh you know putting the filters"
5339840,5349200," inside out so let's find the client so and we're simply gonna send that message there right so we're"
5349200,5356080," simply sending that message there uh so token so this is the stream this is the string this is more of an"
5356080,5365040," author author author right so we cloned that author and but oh yeah so we actually"
5365040,5374720," cloned the reference we cloned the arc right so that's cool okay that's pretty cool uh and uh in the"
5374720,5383600," client we need to have out uh and this is going to be boolean right so out boolean now this is the"
5383600,5390960," interesting part this is an interesting part when we receive the message from the user so we also have"
5390960,5396880," a bunch of filters first of all does that uh user even exist in the list of connection if it doesn't"
5396880,5402160," we just skip them that means it's some sort of a dead uh letter so we don't care about them anymore"
5402160,5408640," then we check the rate limits right so all of the rate limits then we check the uh the utf fade and"
5408640,5415120," stuff like that so we checked all of that and we get to the point here we got to the point here where"
5415120,5424080," we are about to relay the messages but if the current client if the author right so we even have a point"
5424080,5430960," to the author um do we have a point to the author where yeah here it is so this is the author if the author"
5430960,5437440," is not authorized instead of sending that message to everyone we should perform authentication right"
5437440,5443120," that's the moment where we have to take whatever they send and compare it to the actual talking that"
5443120,5457040," is known to the server uh so and uh this is how we can do that so author uh out right so if the author"
5457040,5465840," authorized only then we're certain sort of like sending all of that to each individual uh client in there"
5466880,5475840," but not really not really first of all we're not sending that to the author itself and also to anyone"
5475840,5481760," who's not authorized so that's kind of interesting right if you're authorized we're not broadcasting"
5481760,5487440," messages to everyone who's not authorized they cannot hear that yet they can't hear that yet"
5487440,5496240," so that's kind of important so and client out so you see what i'm doing here you see what i'm doing here"
5496240,5506320," so now if you're not authorized if you're not authorized uh we have to uh do the thing that we do in out"
5506320,5516640," rice out rice function in here so here we're kind of reading the whole thing but we have the message"
5516640,5521840," already checked already checked for us yeah we literally have the the message we can just basically"
5521840,5533760," take it and compare it uh right so that means i can do if text uh not equal like equal to the token"
5533760,5538960," we are authorized so author out"
5538960,5546400," true and that's it like do we need to do anything else we just say"
5546400,5553520," okay you're authorized now so you know the token and we have to send the message uh to to the user"
5553520,5560480," that uh welcome to the club buddy right so welcome to the club buddy so we can even say who's authorized"
5560480,5566320," so you can see we're just using the chunks of this code and stuff like that"
5566320,5571440," uh welcome to the club buddy we send all of that stuff"
5572080,5581840," and yeah if whatever you send is incorrect we can basically tell you bro and that's everything that's"
5581840,5593840," everything we can sell to you so bro um let me let me see invalid uh token right invalid token"
5595200,5604480," so we say invalid token to you after that after saying invalid token i think we need to shut down"
5604480,5611280," your string right we need to close you and we need to remove you from the list of the clients as well"
5611280,5616000," right we're essentially instantly disconnecting you instantly"
5617360,5620640," yeah let me just remove you invalid token go away"
5620640,5632400," so that's pretty cool now it's a little bit nested but uh we can factor all of that out a little bit"
5632400,5642720," later we can factor all that out a little bit later uh okay that is very pokers um so yeah let's try to"
5642720,5648480," compile that and go to the compilation errors and everything invalid token okay"
5648480,5658640," sure uh what a token brah okay can you see that can you see that i can see it's here"
5658640,5666720," uh so yeah there we go let's go to the compilation errors um this is not the compilations errors i want it"
5666720,5674320," cargo run so what are you talking about in here so we don't have a token so that's the point uh we need"
5674320,5682080," to uh accept the token in here and that makes it easier so now we don't have to copy 32 bytes on each"
5682080,5690240," individual connection the very thing everyone was like so wind up about oh my god you're copying 32 bytes"
5690240,5696160," on each individual connection what the fuck we can't afford that in 2023 we can't afford programming in"
5696160,5703040," python in 2023 but we can't afford copying 32 bytes in a very low level language we can't do that"
5703040,5714000," uh so now we don't have to do that now we don't have to uh so here's the client we don't accept the token in here we don't care"
5715040,5721200," uh and uh so we don't pass the token in here and what's funny is that we don't even have to"
5721200,5727040," clone the token we can just move it inside because it's not used anywhere else it's only used on the"
5727040,5733280," server uh yeah we only use it on the server so let's go to the compilation errors what else do we have in"
5733280,5745520," here uh so stream okay so this is not really a stream um stream is within the our author right stream is"
5745520,5755280," within the author so we have to do uh author connection instead and the next one uh author connection instead"
5755920,5764480," and the last one author uh connection shut down okay so what else do we have in here so"
5764480,5770720," token token clone we don't have to do that it's redundant what else do we have now we have"
5770720,5779200," okay leaked token by the way uh leaked token uh so let me see so we don't need this function anymore"
5781120,5788160," so we can actually build there we go okay that was actually easier than i expected that was"
5788160,5797040," really easier than i expected so now all of that is inside out so uh now the rate limits and filters"
5797040,5803680," and stuff like that are automatically applied even during authentication even during authentication right"
5803680,5808400," because we keep track of the different clients but some of the clients may be authorized some of them"
5808400,5814000," may not be authorized and during the final broadcast right so when we are about to broadcast something"
5814000,5819680," we check are you authorized okay so if you're authorized we are broadcasting all your messages"
5819680,5825360," but we're not broadcasting them to everyone we don't broadcast it to you and the people who are not"
5825360,5831200," authorized right so some of the people in the in the queue like not in the queue but in the table"
5831200,5834720," may not be authorized yet and because of that they're not going to receive anything so that's"
5834720,5840960," quite important so we take that into account as well with that into account as well so this is sort of"
5840960,5847840," like the the central hub through which everything is broadcasted then back to all the users"
5847840,5856000," so let's see if it's going to work surprisingly it compiles right so it seems to be working"
5857120,5868240," compiling stuff like that as usual as usual so let's actually cd there uh like so and let's do cargo run um"
5868240,5881440," right so this is the token uh now i'm going to try to connect uh to uh telnet um yeah telnet and 27001"
5881440,5889840," 6969 uh okay it asks for a token that's cool uh now i'm going to grab the token we can set a time out"
5889840,5898240," for how long you wait for a token we can set a time out right so essentially if you're keeping the"
5898240,5903920," connection for too long if you're trying to slow loris us we're gonna just close that connection right"
5903920,5908400," away but anyway so i'm gonna put this thing in here and welcome to the club buddy right so hello"
5909600,5914480," all right then i can just probably close the connection and everything so if i provide"
5914480,5917760," something like this uh invalid token bra"
5917760,5928240," invalid token bra right so that's basically what's going to happen and interestingly can i now cut uh"
5928240,5939120," depth you random uh to nc uh i'll have 27001 6969 what's going to happen you're banned you're banned"
5939120,5949360," straight up because you were too naughty uh right we didn't authorize you even yet uh but now you you"
5949360,5956240," can't connect right so because that uh so you don't even get to the authorization right so you don't even"
5956240,5974880," get to the authorization uh so yes people say i leaked ip you're talking about 127 001 is that one that leaked ip"
5976080,5980800," or something else"
5980800,5984640," all right so i think uh that's my happy"
5984640,5993440," uh so i think we need to commit that and push that and test that already uh so yeah that seems to be"
5993440,5998960," working i also want you to test by the way uh so i mean i already banned so let me restart this entire thing"
5998960,6010080," uh right so i'm connecting in here and then uh what i do is i authenticate myself and then i go here and i do"
6010080,6020000," tell nets uh like this and a boom so now i can send some messages in here but i'm not receiving any messages in there"
6020720,6027520," right look i'm sending and receiving messages so the server receives them but i don't get them in here"
6027520,6031440," so and that's kind of important that's kind of important so one of the things we can do now"
6032000,6039600," uh right so i can authorize myself like this and i can now start sending and now this thing actually"
6039600,6048240," works and sends the messages so okay it seems to be working as intended seems to be working as intended"
6048240,6057440," so let's go and let's close this entire thing uh so let's go so i'm going to close this stuff"
6059680,6063760," is it not epic chat is not epic i think that's pretty freaking epic"
6063760,6078560," so uh move authentication to the server thread and i'm going to push that right into the repo okay"
6078560,6085520," it's kind of cool i really like how architecture slowly evolves right so it's like layers of filters"
6085520,6089120," and stuff like that and i never developed anything like that before so it's kind of"
6089120,6093520," interesting for me as well to explore the way you can structure this entire code"
6093520,6102640," so okay so let's listen to your mom"
6102640,6107440," clown circus architecture"
6107440,6117040," hey bro i want to ask something uh out of conception what would the best full stack stack forever with the"
6117040,6123040," best performance yeah there is a new kind of architecture it's called circus clown architecture"
6123040,6128480," so you probably heard about uh surface the service server client architecture"
6128480,6136720," right service client architecture forget about that forget about that in 2023 it's a circus club"
6139600,6147280," it's when it's when you have like a one big circus full of clowns that's how architecture works that's"
6147280,6154080," basically the architecture anyway so uh let's continue so i'm gonna actually go to here and uh we are in your"
6154080,6163040," mom by the way we are in your mom so i'm gonna go and just fetch this entire thing uh that's right and"
6163040,6172480," i'm gonna merge uh merge origin main so oh yeah we still have this kind of thing so i'm gonna uh reset"
6172480,6177440," minus minus hard right so we're gonna reset it hard and i'm gonna merge that one more time so i'm gonna"
6177440,6185120," rebuild this entire thing and that was quick that was actually quick so basically all of discord"
6185120,6191680," i don't know i don't really know how exactly uh discord work internally but maybe maybe that's how it"
6191680,6198400," works who knows uh so let's go into the server uh and yeah this is the safe mode i'm gonna put true in"
6198400,6204640," here and we're gonna rebuild uh this entire thing we're gonna rebuild this entire thing i'm gonna hide"
6204640,6208880," uh this stuff i'm gonna hide this stuff"
6208880,6219760," and i'm about to start the application chat get ready right so for anyone who's curious if you have"
6219760,6224560," an access to the discord it's the secrets channel it's the secrets channel so there is"
6225120,6231120," uh a token there will be a token in there oh somebody actually suggesting to uh also build it"
6231120,6240240," with release so that's also not a bad idea i think uh so maybe build release it so that will require"
6240240,6245120," rebuilding like literally everything with it okay so you debated me into rebuilding my whole project get"
6245120,6250640," fucking chat chat how the fuck did you keep debating me"
6250640,6261440," chat literally debated me into rebuilding my entire project with release on the server"
6261440,6271680," all right so that seems to be fine um target uh i think it's release and this is a server"
6272880,6280800," all right uh i'm about to actually chat stop i i can't copy paste the token yet you guys are already"
6280800,6282480," connecting um"
6282480,6288960," huh wait a second this is sus"
6288960,6293040," uh i see people sending"
6293040,6302800," i almost had a heart attack right so i only started the thing and i already see clients send message in his"
6302880,6308160," think what the fuck how did they send messages already i'm logging outside of like authenticate"
6308160,6314480," checking for authentication and stuff like that like almost got a heart attack okay this is where it"
6314480,6322560," should be uh right so maybe we should also log if anyone is trying to authenticate right now um"
6322560,6331600," so um yeah so when somebody connected we we're just waiting all right all right so so that's fine"
6332880,6342800," um um so send message when the log is not okay so there is another thing that we don't log in here uh"
6342800,6355840," uh right there's another thing that we don't log in here so it's info um um failed authorization right so and we can do sense uh author uh author addr"
6355840,6369840," um right so let me now recompile the syntax right and i'm gonna basically push that um tweak the logging to make more sense"
6369840,6383920," so get reset hard uh right i'm gonna pitch the latest stuff like so"
6383920,6392240," so it's interesting this is how i deploy things right i push and then on the server over ssh i pull"
6392800,6407680," right right so build uh release uh git push fixes yeah exactly git push fixes uh so by the way i forgot a very"
6407680,6416560," important thing so server rs so it's going to save mode maybe i should log everything into a file"
6417440,6423200," and then what i log to std out i log just information how many people are currently"
6423200,6428640," connected or something like that because that's the information i'm really curious about so we can"
6428640,6436320," basically look this is how many people connected that many out of all of the people is waiting for"
6436320,6443040," authentication that many are already authorized and we can like update that information in real time right"
6443040,6449440," it's just like show and we can clearly see who's got in and uh stuff like that that would be actually kind"
6449440,6454720," of cool some sort of metrics we would literally see uh what's going on in there that would be useful"
6454720,6460320," um so let me rebuild this kind of thing"
6460320,6470960," uh so where is the target okay i'm starting the server holy why okay i'm restarting it again"
6473040,6477920," uh"
6477920,6480080," you mother okay"
6480080,6501280," fuck you whoever's doing that so essentially because of the logging uh i can't quickly copy paste the token"
6503040,6505040," i don't know if i'm going to copy paste it again i'm going to copy paste it again i'm going to copy paste it again"
6505040,6507040," and then i'm going to copy paste it again and i'm going to copy paste it again and i'm going to copy paste it again"
6507040,6509040," and then i'm going to copy paste it again and i'm going to copy paste it again and i'm going to copy paste it again"
6509040,6534460," I got it. I got it. I was sneaky. I was sneaky. Okay. So the thing is this. Okay. This is the new token. Okay. So yeah, people are authorizing. People are authorizing. Fuck you, whoever been doing that. Fuck you. Tricked you."
6535320,6550800," Okay. So you just have to do that like suddenly. You just have to do that suddenly. Essentially, what we probably want to do. Oh, fuck. Okay. I see. Yeah."
6555600,6572280," All right. All right. All right. All right. And here we're slowly going to the next topic, maybe for the next day. Yeah. So this is going to be the topic for the next stream."
6573380,6579520," Actually, asynchronous and probably like a single threaded architecture. So yeah."
6579520,6596900," Actually, the dust actually did. All right. So yeah, essentially we'll need to. Yeah."
6596900,6608380," Maybe we need to think about this kind of stuff, like what's going on, like limit the amount of connections from a single, from a single IP and also do like EPOL, right?"
6608380,6614880," People are suggesting pretty, pretty good things like EPOL and stuff like that. Increase your limit. I didn't think it's going to solve it."
6614880,6618380," I think it's going to solve that. It has to be solved slightly differently, but yeah."
6619260,6630480," So, yep. So we're going to, we're going to actually finish it for today. We're going to finish it for today. Thank you so much, by the way, for, for helping me to do those that, whoever you are."
6630480,6638840," I really appreciate that. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's exactly what we need. Right. So that's exactly what we need."
6638840,6648120," All right. So I'm already streaming for how, for how long I'm streaming for more than two hours. So I think that's enough for today. That is enough for today."
6649120,6665700," I guess that's it for today. Thanks everyone who's watching right now. I really appreciate it. Thank you everyone who helped to DDoS the thing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I see you all on the next recreational programming session with Amista Azuzian. I love you all."
