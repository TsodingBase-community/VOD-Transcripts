160,5600," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session with Ahu"
5600,11280," Amista Azorzin. So lately we've been developing this really weird thing, right? So I was playing"
11280,17680," with a raycasting algorithm in web, right? So essentially raycasting algorithm is basically"
17680,24960," like a 3D from 90s and 80s. Wolfenstein 3D was implemented using this kind of technique."
24960,29520," It's a very simple technique and it doesn't ever require any OpenGL or anything like that."
29520,36080," This entire thing is actually using 2D canvas, right? It is using 2D canvas. It was kind of fun,"
36080,41920," it was kind of interesting, but then I thought can we make a game out of that, right? So I kind of"
41920,48080," really want to make a game out of that, especially because I have a very old laptop, so not that many"
48080,54880," games, like I can't really play that many games in here. So and yeah, so I can just like implement"
54880,60480," a game that I would personally play, right? So to just entertain myself. And what kind of game I would"
60480,70000," like to play? I really like to play roguelike games, right? So and roguelike games with like a 3D graphic"
70000,76880," with Wolfenstein 3D sounds like kind of interesting. Also working in your browser also sounds kind of"
76880,83840," interesting and that's exactly what I'd like to attempt today. Maybe we'll see, we'll see how it goes,"
83840,88800," right? So we'll see, we'll see how it goes. So the first thing we probably need to do, we probably need"
88800,94560," to make it look like roguelike, right? So it's probably going to be sort of like a dungeons,"
94560,99920," right? So essentially you start at a particular dungeon as a dungeon master, right? Like a van."
99920,108320," So and you have like walls out of stone, maybe some chains and stuff like that. So we'll need to have"
108320,115120," some sort of like a floor and ceiling. And you go through different rooms, you collect some different"
115120,120400," items, maybe some keys, maybe some other stuff, maybe some weapons, potions and stuff like that."
120400,127680," And you find the ladder down to the next floor and then it kind of repeats itself. So you basically go"
127680,134640," constantly going down and down and down and down. And this is not Isaac by the way. Original rogue game"
134640,139920," developed for, I don't know what it's developed for, but the one that didn't even have like a GUI,"
139920,147040," it was completely text game. The original rogue game was basically like that. What's interesting"
147040,152000," is that if you download the original rogue game and try to play it, you would be fucking surprised how"
152000,161840," how it looks like basically Isaac. It is actually kind of insane. Like, so Isaac is basically the original"
161840,167920," rogue. They just extended it and added shit. Literally, by the way, they literally added shit,"
167920,172160," the literal shit. So yeah, so I was thinking about something like that."
172160,180880," Right. So but to make it look like, you know, like a dungeon, right, we need to have some sort of like"
180880,187920," assets and shit. So let's actually go into open game art and maybe grab some free assets, right? So open"
187920,193440," game art. There's also net hack, right? So but net hack is not the original rogue game."
194400,200400," Right. So rogue game. We can take a look at it. So the original rogue game is still available online."
200400,209920," It is like net hack, but it's much simpler actually. So it's from 1980. Yeah, it's pretty old. I really like"
209920,217040," how so there's like this thumbnail. The game looks nothing like that. The game looks nothing like that."
217040,220240," In fact, it looks like. Yeah. So this is how the game looks like actually."
220240,229760," This is kind of funny, right? So this is the trailer, right? This is the trailer, right? And then down there,"
230640,231600," this is the gameplay."
231600,243840," Oh, hell, you clickbait. I mean, people been clickbaiting since fucking forever. Actually,"
243840,249600," people think that all this like clickbaiting is like a new thing of the modern internet. In fact,"
249600,257120," people been doing that fucking constantly, right? So it's basically the problem of packaging, right?"
257120,263760," Okay. So essentially, like if you are, look at the supermarkets, the supermarkets,"
263760,271840," I think supermarkets represent the modern YouTube quite well. Supermarkets like a space where different"
271840,278560," brands can place themselves. And when the brands, they designed the packaging for their product,"
278560,287200," they actually keep in mind that their packaging must stand out as the customer passes by."
287200,292640," And they need to grab their attention within few milliseconds. And with these kind of limitations,"
292640,298960," with these kind of technical requirements in mind, they designed their packaging. YouTube is literally like"
298960,306160," that. It is literally a supermarket that allows you to place your products and you need to package your"
306160,311920," product. So it grabs the attention of the customer within a few milliseconds. It's literally like that."
311920,318080," The same with video games. Like it's basically the same game, right? It's a sort of like a packaging game."
318080,323600," Right. So and because of that, people have been doing that forever. Like as soon as you grab the attention,"
323600,328640," right, you kind of won already. You can put whatever the fuck you want in there. So that's the game"
328640,334560," everyone is playing. And it's not even YouTube game. It's like it's been forever. So anyway,"
334560,340240," if we take a look at this game, we can, as far as I know, there's still source code for this game"
340240,347680," available somewhere on GitHub. Right. So I wonder if we can buy it, buy it. I wonder if we can download it."
347680,354080," Okay, so we can do something like GitHub rogue game source code."
354080,368160," So original rogue game 5.4.4. I never even started. What the fuck? I never actually started. So one"
368160,374240," thing I remember about this game, by the way, is that it's not compilable as everything. Right. So it's in"
374240,380400," in compilable state. And you need to kind of fix it first to be able to actually work with it. So"
380400,387120," I'm going to give the link to the chat. If anyone in the chat is actually fucking interested. And for"
387120,394240," people who's in the description, right, I'm going to put it in YouTube. Right. So let me let me see."
394240,401040," Let me grab the source code. All right. And I'm going to just like do git clone. How many commits do"
401040,406160," we have? Do we have too many commits in here? There's there's only one commit eight years ago."
406160,411120," One commit. Okay. So we don't have to do a shallow clone. Right. So we don't really have to do a"
411120,418560," shallow clone. We can just clone this shit. All right. Cool. Okay. So we've got the source code"
418560,424880," and maybe we will need the source code. Right. So maybe we're going to grab, maybe we can steal some ideas"
424880,429840," from the original rogue game. Okay. So I'm going to configure and let's see what is going to happen."
429840,437360," So we are cross compiling. No. So we're configuring some shit. I really like how Emacs automatically like"
437360,441600," parses all of these yes and no's and stuff like that and just like displays them properly. That's"
441600,448080," actually kind of cool. I think. All right. So it generated make files. So let's actually do make. And"
448960,454720," yeah, so it just compiles all these things. One of the things I like about the implementation of this"
454720,460960," game. Right. And this is as far as an original, original rogue game that started the whole fucking"
460960,466400," genre. If you take a look at the source code, it looks like a fucking assembly. It's it's C,"
466400,472960," but it feels like an assembly. Right. So it's just basically like sequence of this like single commands."
472960,480000," Right. It's like a very old style, like old school C that feels almost like assembly. I really"
480000,486560," fucking love it. I actually really fucking love it. So, okay. So it compiles. Right. So I remember it"
486560,490720," had like problems with compiling with all of that, but in fact, it compiles. So maybe they fixed some"
490720,496640," problems in here. Anyways, so it just created a single executable. A raguye. Okay. So here's a raguye."
496640,501120," So it's a single executable. Does it depend on anything? It doesn't even depend on anything. It depends on"
501120,507440," and courses and T info and stuff like that. But I mean, that's, that's acceptable. That's in fact"
507440,514080," acceptable. So let's go into the folder and let's start the game. It, it didn't fucking start."
514080,525520," That's, that's very interesting. So yeah, maybe it's too old. It's too fucking old. What if it's"
525520,531040," because of the team use? Uh, can I just start something like, uh, oh yeah, it was because of"
531040,537040," team use apparently. Interesting. It just didn't want to start on team use. It didn't even say anything"
537040,542240," in there. Oh yeah. Here's the game. Here's basically the game. So as far as I know, we can use arrows"
542240,550160," and at is the, is the player. Right. I don't really know the controls. Uh, right. I don't really know the controls."
550160,556320," Uh, but as far as I know, yeah, you can do a question mark, uh, character you want help for."
556320,561520," Okay. So, and then you can read, uh, all of the different characters, right? So question mark prints"
561520,569440," help slash identifies an object. Right. So there is a mechanic in the, in the game that is similar to"
570000,576480," pills in, in the binding of Isaac. Right. So you, you know who played the binding of Isaac,"
576480,584000," by the way? Uh, so it has this mechanic of pills. You don't know what the pill does unless you take it."
584000,588880," So you kind of discover what, what the effect of the pill is. So there's a kind of similar mechanic"
588880,593440," in here for items, right? So for weapons and stuff like that. So if you take a weapons, you don't know"
593440,599280," its stats or anything like that. You have to identify it first. Uh, right. So, and to identify it,"
599280,605440," I think you have to have identification score. I think it's a, I think it's a mechanic from Diablo 2."
605440,610800," I think I remember this mechanic from Diablo 2 or something like that. Oh yeah. So, uh, I don't"
610800,618080," quite remember, but anyway, so, so you have different scores and stuff like that. Okay. So the star in here"
618080,627440," is gold, you found 22 gold pieces. And here we have B, if you go into the B, uh, you swing and miss the bat."
627440,635920," Okay. So B apparently is a bat, right? To attack the bat, I just go into the bat and I just swing and attack it."
635920,642080," You miss the bat. You miss the bat. You have injured the bat. And I suppose I killed it. Uh, okay. You"
642080,650240," have defeated the bat and there we go. We are alone in this room. So we have a level one gold 22 health and"
650240,656800," strength, uh, you know, arm and experience and stuff like that. So we can now go here. So the, there is a"
656800,664320," a corridor in here and it will probably go into a different room. So we have S. So S is probably some"
664320,671600," sort of a snake. Yeah, it is. It is the snake. Okay. So that's pretty cool. Uh, right. So I keep, uh,"
671600,677920," attacking the snake and I defeated it. And that's the entirety of the game. This is the original"
677920,684080," rogue. This is literally the original rogue game that created the whole fucking genre of"
684080,689120," like games, like Isaac, some other stuff, right? So the Isaac's probably the most famous one. That's why"
689120,694880," I keep referring to it. If you try to play it, you would be surprised how it is like Isaac. It's,"
694880,700560," it's actually kind of cool. So here's the item, uh, you, you scale mail, right? So that's pretty cool."
700560,708400," But if you press F, uh, I don't know, it asks me for direction. So yeah. So what's funny is that"
708400,713920," it also here has secret rooms, right? So from time to time, you can try to go"
713920,720320," against the walls and from time to time, you will actually find that walls are like,"
720320,724560," some of the walls are fake and you will go through them and you will find a secret room."
724560,731680," Uh, right. So, and it's step-based. So it's kind of like similar to Eapers and stuff like that."
731680,738720," Uh, right. So there's the E in here. Okay. So, oh, it's, it's, it's chasing me. This"
738720,744320," motherfucker is chasing me. Holy fucking shit. Anyway. So, uh, can I, can I actually quit in here?"
744320,749840," Uh, yeah. So there we go. We're actually good. So this is the original rogue. So I want to develop"
749840,755760," something like that, but with, uh, these kind of graphics, right? So let me actually show you. So then,"
757120,765280," uh, ray casting, ray casting, casting, casting, um, yeah, with this kind of graphics. So that's what I"
765280,769920," want to do. Uh, I think it's going to be kind of interesting, right? So instead of like this 2D"
769920,776080," text thingy, uh, to have this kind of stuff, right? I think that would be interesting, at least to try,"
776080,784400," at least to try. Uh, so anyway, let's go into the open game art, uh, open game art. And let me see what we"
784400,791840," could even have there. Um, to, to, okay. So, uh, we'll get some subs, by the way. I think I need to"
791840,799680," acknowledge the subs. Um, uh, so thank you so much, mateysf777 for tier 1 sequition with the message is 66"
799680,808160," months starting soon with Zozin. 66 months. Yo 69 soon, 69 soon. Uh, nullifier. Thank you so much for tier 1."
808160,812160," In Lois. Thank you so much for Twitch Prime with the message. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey to you too."
812160,816960," Uh, so Akoi here. Thank you so much for tier 1 with the message. Adobe Flash game stream web."
816960,824320," I don't know. Can you even like do Flash games on, on Linux? Is there any tools that allow you to do"
824320,828160," that? I think there was something like open source for this kind of stuff, but I'm, and I don't know."
828160,831520," I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's like the problem with the Flash"
831520,835680," games these days is that like they're not playable on the modern browsers anymore. So"
835680,843120," I don't know. I don't know. So these days the modern web is so powerful. You can have"
843120,850960," a Flash player implemented in on the web stack itself, right? So you can use probably JavaScript"
850960,857120," and maybe WebAssembly to implement an interpreter for, for the Flash things, for the Flash SVF files."
857120,861680," I forgot how they were called. And maybe there is something like that for that. Maybe there is"
861680,866080," something like that for that. Voidmanger, thank you so much for your description with the message."
866080,874560," Could you use the map from the AD game for this, for this game? Uh, I probably could, but I was thinking"
874560,882000," about a procedure generating the maps. Um, right. So the thing about the EPRS, um, is that I handcrafted the,"
882000,886080," the map, uh, and in here I just want to procedure generate this kind of stuff. For those who doesn't"
886080,890960," know what kind of game I'm talking about, like recently I implemented a game in ADA. Uh, right."
890960,898480," It's also grid based, but it's 2d1. So it's called EPRS. I'm gonna give the link, uh, to the chat and for"
898480,904080," people in the description, I'm gonna give it to YouTube. Right. So here is the game. We can take a"
904080,912800," look at it. So program EPRS, EPRS, EPRS, EPRS. Uh, and, uh, so here it is. So I can try to start this entire thing."
913360,920080," Uh, this is how the game looks like. So it's a 2d game. It even has a sound if I remember. Yeah. So it even has"
920080,927680," music and stuff like that. So this is the game I developed. Uh, right. So it's a very cool game. I really"
927680,939280," like the look and feel of the game. Uh, right. So the palette especially. Uh, so it's supposed to collect"
939280,948720," this sort of bombs, right? So then you place the bomb and that's it. So you go to like a different"
948720,955680," place in here. That's the game we're talking about. And it has a map and this map is actually handcrafted."
955680,960560," Right. So the map is completely handcrafted. Uh, right. So, and I don't really want to use the"
960560,965840," same map. Right. So it's, it's going to be completely different game, I suppose. Uh,"
965840,970640," people already, uh, trying to do Adobe flash on top of wasm with ruffle. The problem is that a"
970640,980320," spec is like 3000 pages long and underspecified. That sucks. So by the way, if you want to play this"
980320,989600," game on, uh, windows, you can download it in releases. And also I think it's available on each.io. So let"
989600,1001120," me see each.io. So here's the each page. So I compiled the executables for windows and linux. Uh, so you"
1001120,1005440," should be able to actually download this. And I think if you want to play it, it's a very small game,"
1005440,1011360," actually. It's a very small game, but it's free. Right. So, uh, I just developed it because I"
1011360,1016400," want you to try to develop the game. Um, it was super fun. I really enjoy making a game. Maybe I"
1016400,1021280," should have become a game developer or something. It's, it's actually super fun to craft these small"
1021280,1027120," universes with a set of rules and just observe the emergent behavior of this set of rules. I think"
1027120,1032160," it's kind of cool. Why you choose Ada? Why not? Right. Because I want you to try this language,"
1032160,1041760," uh, because language doesn't really matter. Um, right. Um, and I kind of enjoyed it. So it's an"
1041760,1048240," alright language. Uh, a little bit bureaucratic, a little bit enterprising, but still usable. Uh,"
1048240,1054400," because NSA suggested it. Yeah, exactly. That's literally the reason. NSA told me you must use"
1054400,1061680," Ada for everything now. Uh, you must use Ada for everything. Okay. So what we need to have in here."
1061680,1069280," So let's find some like a cobblestone textures or something, uh, cobblestone. Right. Do we have some"
1069280,1080800," cobblestone? Uh, right. So maybe, um, stone texture, stone texture. Okay. So there's some stuff in here."
1082320,1093280," So we have wall grass and your mom's ass. Oh, okay. So this doesn't really look like what I need. Uh,"
1093280,1101520," but maybe that's all right. Maybe that's all right. Um, what about, what if I put the dungeon in here,"
1101520,1112480," like a dungeon, uh, textures, dungeon textures, 3d castle? This doesn't look like it."
1112480,1128320," So there's an old wall text. Okay. Uh huh. What else do we have? So far only maybe this one is kind of"
1128880,1135120," something that could be used by us. Right. So if you look at these kinds of things, um, yeah,"
1135120,1144960," all the wall. All right. So we have a weather text CC by, uh, zip, right? Okay. I'm going to be"
1144960,1151120," downloading this thing. I'm already downloading this entire stuff. Uh, it's like a seven megabytes,"
1151120,1158800," seven megabytes of texture, uh, seven megabytes of texture. So this is the images. Honestly, uh,"
1158800,1163440," I probably going to have a lot of different assets for the game. So I would like to introduce the assets"
1163440,1169040," folder and I'm going to move the images into the assets folder. Right. So I'm going to move it like"
1169040,1181600," that. Um, so now in here, what we're need to do, I'm going to go into the downloads. So here is the thing."
1181600,1191840," I'm going to literally move it in here. Uh, and what I'm thinking is that can I just take, yeah. So here it is,"
1191840,1202000," here is this stuff credits.txt. I don't want to lose, um, the original pages of the assets that I'm"
1202000,1208640," using because, uh, I want to keep like, uh, keep the links in the credits. Right. So because of that,"
1208640,1215200," I'm trying to be like a super careful and stuff like that, uh, open game art. So this is open game art."
1215200,1220640," I'm moving that stuff in here and maybe this stuff in here as well. So let me see what's inside of this"
1220640,1226720," entire thing. Okay. So there's no zip bomb. Uh, let's actually unpack this. So what do we have in"
1226720,1231920," here? So there's a wall in here. Okay. That's pretty cool. So there's a wall. Oh, it's, it's a normal."
1231920,1240800," So we don't really need normals though. This is interesting chat. Has anyone actually tried to"
1240800,1248880," use normal maps in a ray caster? Wait, what the fuck? It's not even that hard."
1248880,1257200," Has anyone ever thought about like, I mean, the normal maps were developed like way after people"
1257200,1261360," kind of abandoned ray casting. So like never needed to do that."
1261360,1270080," This is such an interesting idea, like a user normal maps, because like with a, uh, you're probably going"
1270080,1276000," to have some sort of like a lighting, uh, and it's not that hard, right? So essentially you figured out this"
1276000,1280240," strip that you need to render, right? You figured out the strip that you need to render. You take this"
1280240,1287440," strip from the normal map, you reinterpret the colors as the normal, right? And that's how you sort of change"
1287440,1293680," the, the coloring and shit. Uh, that is a very interesting idea. So I think I'll write it down."
1293680,1297520," I'm not sure if I'm going to try to implement it, but I can try to implement it at some point."
1297520,1305120," So what, what is the Shaga? N is a normal maps. What is Shaga? Does anybody know? Does anybody recognize?"
1305120,1311440," I'm not a game developer. I don't recognize this kind of thing. Uh, so does anyone know what kind of thing it is?"
1311440,1318320," Right? Because normal maps, they do have some sort of like an iconic look, uh, right? But this thing,"
1318320,1325520," I do not recognize that. Uh, so maybe we can try to Google it up. Shaga map. Shadows something."
1325520,1346400," Okay. So it could be, um, interactive map. Uh, okay. Maybe normal maps and, uh, normal map, shadow,"
1346400,1353360," global, something, something, maybe some kind of baked occlusion map. Maybe, uh, again, I'm not a game"
1353360,1358640," developer, so I do not recognize this kind of thing. Uh, but it's kind of nice that we do have this kind"
1358640,1365120," of stuff. Uh, so this is the color wall three. This is a broken wall. Okay. That's pretty cool. So that"
1365120,1372960," may work out. So in the color four, so we can try to use this kind of stuff. We can try to use that. Okay."
1372960,1382720," So, uh, let's go and maybe, uh, try to use this kind of walls. So I'm going to go to TS."
1383760,1387840," And let's just load some of these assets. Oh, by the way, those things are not,"
1387840,1394480," are not correct anymore. So now they are located in assets, right? So it's now images and stuff like"
1394480,1398800," that. Oh, it's kind of interesting. Like recently off screen, I implemented this kind of thing. So"
1398800,1404000," if you have assets that are not loadable, they're going to be replaced by a purple block, right? So"
1404000,1410080," essentially, if I just try to open this kind of thing, uh, right now, let me actually restart. So as"
1410080,1417680," far as I know, I killed the, um, oh, this thing, yeah, this thing doesn't work anymore. Uh, yeah, I killed"
1417680,1423920," the server. So I need to kind of restart this entire stuff. So npm around watch, uh, right. So I implemented"
1423920,1428720," recently watch mod for, for the entire project. It's actually kind of cool. I can show you how it looks like."
1429680,1438640," Um, so a watch sub command actually run, runs watch.js. So, and it's a custom script that runs"
1438640,1444400," first type script in watch mode and HTP server and just keeps them simultaneously. It just runs them"
1444400,1448880," simultaneously. It's pretty convenient. So there's a little bit of a wrapper code for starting command,"
1448880,1454320," commands and stuff like that, but it's a custom, like a watch mode. Uh, right. You know how modern frameworks,"
1454320,1460000," they have some sort of like a serve watch mode, uh, right. So you just start it and it just brings up"
1460000,1464320," your entire development environment. You just open it in the browser, you modify something that"
1464320,1468320," automatically reloads and stuff like that. I can't do this kind of show myself. Look at that. I'm a,"
1468320,1474160," I'm a web developer. It's that fucking easy. You just spawn child processes and there you go. Uh, so"
1474160,1480320," not even using exactly. I'm not even using advice. You can just do all of that"
1480320,1484320," shit yourself. Like, come on. Uh, you can just do that shit yourself."
1484320,1491360," I think that's pretty cool. I think that's pretty poggers. Uh, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes."
1491360,1497760," Uh, to, to, to, to, um, no web pack. I'm not using web pack. To be fair,"
1497760,1503840," the entirety of the game is just a single JS file. So I didn't really see any point in using, uh, web packs,"
1503840,1508720," right. It's, it's literally like a single file. Um, unless I will start like separating into different"
1508720,1514880," modules. Um, I don't see any reason to introduce any packaging or anything like that. Um, yeah."
1514880,1522000," So anyways, so we've got that. Uh, if I refresh this entire, yeah, as you can see, all of them became"
1522000,1529920," purple because it couldn't load them. Right. So it literally couldn't load them. Uh, so now, uh,"
1529920,1536240," I want to try to fix this entire stuff. Right. So let's go ahead and fix all these things. So it's"
1536240,1542320," going to be assets. There we go. And I'm going to refresh this entire thing. And did it work? It"
1542320,1550320," didn't fucking work mate. I wonder why. Uh, because it's asserts. Jesus Christ, bro. Okay."
1551040,1559760," Yeah. Now we're talking. And now we're fucking talking, man. Uh, all right. Uh, so what we need"
1559760,1565600," to load in here, we need to load the wall. Uh, I'm going to go into the assets, images, open game art,"
1565600,1571760," and this thingy, Majingy. And, uh, I'm going to just do that. So this is going to be assets."
1572880,1581600," This is the sub path that we have in here. Const wall one, load image data, uh, put it in here."
1581600,1587600," And here is the wall that we're loading. So it's a synchronous call. So we have to do a wait,"
1587600,1593120," because this entire thing returns a promise. Uh, yeah, it does return the promise. And if it failed"
1593120,1598640," for whatever freaking reason, we're going to just replace it with a color purple, uh, like so. So we'll get"
1598640,1603840," a wall. So this compile, uh, it compiles without any errors, uh, right. And let's replace this"
1603840,1608720," studenpog with a wall one, like so. And let's go ahead and refresh. Okay. So"
1608720,1618160," doesn't look half as bad. What the fuck?"
1618160,1626080," What the fuck, chat? Why is this? Okay. What if we replace all of them with walls and stuff? Right."
1626080,1636560," So this is going to be, uh, wall one, uh, wall one, uh, wall one, wall one, wall one, wall one, wall one."
1636560,1648400," Yeah, let's go. Very dungeon-like. Exactly. It does fucking feel like dungeon. Holy shit, I love it. I love it so much."
1651840,1657200," So, but this is only like a four walls and stuff, right? So it's only like four of them. Uh, so let's"
1657200,1665520," actually load, um, the rest of the walls. So this is going to be wall one. So this is wall two. Uh, right."
1665520,1674480," This one is wall three. And this one is wall four. Uh, wall four. So for this one, we can just try wall two,"
1675760,1683120," wall three. And this one is going to be wall four just to see how they look like. Uh, yep. They look"
1683120,1690240," differently. All right. So this one doesn't. Okay. So this is actually kind of cool. You can add a little"
1690240,1697120," bit of a variation to the walls in here. That's for sure. You can add a little bit of a variation. Okay."
1697120,1704000," This is like a very special wall. Yeah. That is so fucking cool. So this one, yeah. So there's another"
1704000,1710080," variation. So it's two, two different walls in here. Uh, but this kind of stuff, I think it's okay"
1710080,1714560," for like a different floor. Uh, I think it's okay for a different floor."
1719440,1725760," So there's a little bit of problem in here. We can go through the walls, right? So which actually"
1725760,1732240," like breaks Raycaster. Uh, I think one of the things we should try to do is to make the walls"
1732240,1736720," impenetrable, right? Because as soon as you go into the wall, like it's, it's impossible to get it out."
1736720,1741600," Like you don't know where you are unless you're looking at the minimap. Uh, so one of the things we"
1741600,1748160," probably have to do, you have to add impenetrability, sort of speak of the, of the wall. This is so doomy."
1748160,1752320," Yeah, because we're using kind of the same technique that Doom used, which is raycasting."
1752320,1760240," So I suppose we, we don't need to load any of these things anymore, right? So we don't really"
1760240,1769520," care. We only have walls and stuff. We only have walls. Um, so, uh, let me do a committee committee."
1769520,1776000," I think, I think committee committee as of right now is going to be a good idea. Uh, in terms of assets, I'm not"
1776000,1783120," sure if I want to commit the entirety of this stuff. Uh, I probably don't want to commit the zip, right?"
1783120,1789360," So I really don't want to commit the zip. Um, but the pngs and stuff like that, I think it's going to be"
1789360,1797440," totally fine. So, and also these kind of things. All right. So they were renamed and everything. Okay."
1799040,1808160," add, uh, dungeon wall textures and stuff. Dungeon wall textures. I'm going to push that right into the"
1808160,1815600," rip-on. Make the walls impenetrable, unlike your mom. God damn it. I taught you well, chat. I taught you well."
1818000,1822080," Uh, Doom didn't use ray casting, actually. I have no idea, honestly. I never played Doom."
1822080,1831360," Believe it or not. It kind of, it kind of went past my childhood, unfortunately."
1831360,1836000," Uh, it really went past my childhood. Uh, thank you so much. D."
1837120,1841440," Jugenson, I hope I pronounced your name correctly. Thank you so much for tier one substitution. Thank you, thank you, thank you."
1841440,1853280," Uh, why? I'm sorry. Like, my first PC was Windows XP. Was on Windows XP. Like, Doom was, like, completely,"
1853280,1861680," like, an old thing at the time. So, I'm really sorry that I was born in a poor country in the third,"
1861680,1868400," like, in a poor family in a third world country. I'm really sorry about that. Should have picked a better location. Sorry."
1868400,1876400," The first PC was bad replying. Cool. Um, anyways."
1876400,1887280," Uh, what do I wanna do in here? So, we are, um, yeah. So, we need to make the walls impenetrable, honestly."
1888640,1896800," We need to make the walls impenetrable. How we are going to do that? Uh, let's open a map paint. Uh,"
1896800,1904960," let's open map paint. Technically, Russia is the second world. Uh, maybe? I don't know if I can know. Uh,"
1904960,1913920," and I'm not sure if I care. So, we have a grid, mother flippers. We have a grid. Uh, so, and essentially,"
1913920,1919680," what we can do. So, we have a position of the player. Right. We have a position of the player"
1919680,1926160," in chat. And, uh, let's actually denote the position of the player. Uh, like this. So, here's the player."
1926160,1932640," Um, so, every time we're about to update the position of the player, we can just take the position of the"
1932640,1942480," player and see if now it points at the cell that has become impenetrable. Unlike your mom! Unlike your mom!"
1942480,1951360," Right. So, this is impenetrable, uh, like this. And so, there is somewhere a place in the code where we update the position of the player. There we go."
1951360,1962480," So, here we update the position of the player, adding the velocity scale by data. We may try to do a very interesting thing. We may actually assign it to a new position. Right. So,"
1962640,1970800," this is a new position now. Uh, right. And the player position equal to new position. But we're only gonna do that."
1970800,1975760," We're only gonna do that if position does, uh, not point to impenetrable wall."
1975760,1982000," You know what I'm talking about? You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, yeah, yeah. How can we check that?"
1982000,1988400," First of all, uh, we need to check if the position is within the scene. We don't want to do out of bounds or anything like that."
1988400,1999760," By the way, can I, can I actually do some, some shit like, like this? So, if I have a node and I have, uh, an array. Right. And I try to get shit out of bounds."
1999760,2009360," So, it's undefined. But in reality, I actually have a two-dimensional array. Right. So, that means sometimes I have shit like this. Right."
2009360,2016560," So, that means sometimes I may get an empty array. Or sometimes I can get undefined. So, if I try to get, uh, yeah."
2016560,2023760," So, I get a type error. So, I literally get an exception. So, that makes it kind of difficult. Right. So, that makes it kind of difficult."
2023760,2033040," It would be kind of cool if, if it, if it's out of bounds, it always is undefined. But I mean, in that case, it's not going to really work that well."
2033040,2042880," Anyway, unless we actually store everything in a, uh, straightened up array and actually compute the indices, uh, ourselves. Right."
2042880,2049040," We can do that if we wrap the array into the its own thing. Uh, but then I don't really want to do that. Anyway."
2049920,2058080," So, here, um, I think we have a function inside, inside scene. Right. So, there's a function inside scene. Yeah, there we go."
2058080,2065920," So, this is actually a pretty cool function. So, it accepts the scene, which is an array of array of cells. Uh, might as well actually introduce a cell."
2065920,2071920," All right. So, it will probably make it a little bit easier to read. Though, null cell."
2073200,2081920," Hmm. Yeah, it's totally fine. So, it's either null or HTML image element or a color. Uh, right. So, it's basically an array of array of cells."
2081920,2088880," Uh, we check whether the point is within this entire stuff. All right. And in that case, it returns you true if it's inside of the scene."
2089760,2107520," Um, okay. So, if inside scene, uh, new position and scene, new position y, new position x."
2107520,2116720," Y comes first because first come rows. So, first rows, then the columns. And that's why y first, because y is a row."
2117760,2126080," Row, row, row, five to power. Right. And essentially, if we're inside of the new position and a scene is not equal to..."
2126080,2133680," Fucking neighbors, motherfucker. It's not equal to null. We don't want to actually assign the new position."
2133680,2140960," Right. So, but why kappa? It's a good question, actually."
2144320,2150400," I don't know. Because I kind of got used to that. Uh, because I think of the arrays, um, as"
2150400,2157840," the C arrays. Because C arrays, they are, like, located row-wise in the memory. And I kind of got used to that."
2157840,2164640," So, in modern enough.js, you can do question mark thingy. Um, it's the... Is that the LB separator? Yeah,"
2164640,2170320," this is the LB separator. If I know this. Oh, LB separator is actually like this. Yeah, that's the LB separator."
2170320,2174960," This is not an LB separator. Uh, I don't know. We can give it a try. So, let me see."
2174960,2180960," So, if I have something like this. And if I have, like, 10. And, uh, right. How do you do that?"
2180960,2186160," So, it's probably something like... Eh, okay. So, that's very interesting. So, what is it doing here?"
2186720,2194240," It expects you. So, it just first checks. Okay. So, we can try to do that. That sounds interesting."
2194240,2197840," It's a pirate LB separator. Yeah."
2197840,2207440," So, that sounds kind of interesting. So, we can try to do that."
2208480,2212960," Uh, we could try to do that. But, I already kind of done with that."
2212960,2218080," So, anyway. So, essentially, we can do something like this. We can negate that. And there we go."
2218080,2225280," So, maybe we can do, uh, apply the Morgan law. But, I mean, I think that's fine. I think that's"
2225280,2230960," fine to actually do it like that. Uh, all right. So, this is compile. And so, I think it doesn't... No,"
2230960,2236880," it doesn't compile. So, expected two arguments got one. 396. 396. So, what's up with that? Oh, yeah."
2236880,2243120," You're supposed to supply a scene. Are you okay now? You are, in fact, okay. All right. So, let's refresh"
2243120,2249440," everything. Uh, so, there is an error, apparently. So, let's take a look at the logs. Uh, I cannot read"
2249440,2260560," properties of undefined, uh, 396. 396. All right. That's kind of bizarre. Right. So, because"
2260960,2269680," I know this shed is inside. And, uh, I cannot read properties of undefined. Reading 5. Oh, okay."
2269680,2275920," I see. I see what's going on. Yeah. So, because this entire thing is fractional. So, one of the things"
2275920,2283040," we need to do, we need to actually know, um, what cell it is hitting. So, we have to do something like"
2283040,2293120," math floor, uh, right, like this. But, at the same time, we also have to actually check that we're"
2293120,2302000," within this scene with also floored new position. So, it would be kind of nice to create a separating"
2302000,2309200," position, like a new cell position. Right. So, this is just like a regular continuous position, and this is a"
2309200,2316560," new cell position, uh, which you just do something like this, in your, uh, position y, and this is just"
2316560,2326560," like a math floor. Uh, maybe, maybe, chat, we have to, we have to create a new method for floor."
2326560,2332480," We need to create a new method for floor, something like a new position. Round, no, no, no round. We"
2332480,2339120," actually have to round down always, which is floor. Uh, if we do something like floor, new position floor,"
2339120,2347280," is that a good idea? Or, we can even go much cooler. What if we implement map, like this?"
2347280,2352640," I think that sounds actually kind of cool. Right. So, you just map, and it's just like math floors,"
2352640,2360080," like both of them. And then, you can just use this shit like that. New, uh, cell position, like so."
2360080,2368240," And then we go. So, guys think. So, fly check mode. We're doing pure, uh, functional programming,"
2368240,2376000," motherfuckers. We have map. Look at that shit. So, well, we haven't implemented it yet. We're about to"
2376000,2381120," implement it. Don't worry about it. Don't fucking worry about it. We're going to implement the map."
2381120,2385920," So, in here, we're going to accept f, which is a function that accepts a number and returns you"
2385920,2391600," another number, uh, right. And we're going to just return vector 2, which is effectively just new vector."
2392240,2398960," Uh, this x applied f, f this y. How cool is that, mate?"
2398960,2405920," Fucking that, mate? Okay, I'm sorry. How do you define... Okay, so this is how you define a function."
2405920,2412800," Okay. So, fly check next error and no errors. So, we actually implemented that. Yeah, it's not really"
2412800,2420480," much. It's a functor, actually. This is a, this is a functor. It's not monoid nor monad or anything."
2420480,2429520," So, it's just a functor. Um, yeah, because we can do map and shit. Anyways, so we got that. So,"
2429520,2433440," is it working? Is it working? It compiles. It seems to be compiling. And there we go. Okay,"
2433440,2437680," so let's go. Let's see, uh, if we, uh, if it works."
2437680,2448640," Technically it works, as you can, if you, if you look at them, if you look at the minimap, uh, right."
2448640,2454720," So, if you look at the minimap, it does in fact work, but the view still kind of penetrates the wall,"
2454720,2461360," which doesn't really help with, like, this warping of this stuff. So, what's funny is that I feel like,"
2461360,2465760," yeah, the problem here is that we're treating the player as a point,"
2465760,2472160," which is not correct. I think the body, the player should have some body. It should be a little bit"
2472160,2478960," thicker, just like your... Anyway, so it should, the player should be a little bit thicker,"
2478960,2485920," so, um, it's not like a point, so it doesn't really penetrate the wall. Uh, so I think we have to"
2485920,2492800," treat it as a circle, right. So, it's probably like a, uh, like a circle, so it's from the distance of the"
2492800,2500640," wall. Uh, girth the player body. Yeah, exactly. So, he, uh, needs some padding. Yeah, exactly. It needs,"
2500640,2505200," it needs some padding. So, I wonder how we're going to implement that. Uh, I wonder how we're going to"
2505200,2514880," implement that. Just like... Oh, yeah, that, that fucking sucks, honestly. Yeah, I mean, technically"
2514880,2520160," it works, but it's just, like, the, the warping is, is not good. The warping is definitely not good,"
2520160,2525440," it's just, like, not helping at all. Uh, but, but it's, it's close. It's actually close, I think."
2525440,2533120," It's pretty close. Uh, so, one of the interesting things... So, we have a lot of these helper functions"
2533120,2539760," that kind of associated with the scenes and stuff like that, and the scene is not necessarily like a"
2539760,2548000," 2d array. I think the way we talk about the scene is not particularly great. Um,"
2548000,2556160," I think it is not particularly great. Um, right. So, maybe we need to actually refactor the scene to be"
2556160,2562320," something more interesting. So, maybe it could be a class. So, this is a scene and it actually has,"
2562320,2567920," like, an internal cells. Right. So, it's going to be cells and, let's say, it's going to be array of"
2567920,2574480," cells. Right. So, it's an array of cells. Uh, and we have a constructor and what we accept in here,"
2574480,2580240," we just accept an array of cells. But, on top of accepting the array of cells, I think we should"
2580240,2584800," accept the width and height of this thing. Right. So, it's going to be width, which is a number, and height,"
2584800,2590400," which is a number, uh, and we can store all of these things in here. Why is it still out? It's"
2590400,2594960," complaining because, uh, there's a collision between the names and stuff like that. So, it's called scene"
2594960,2603360," two, electric boogaloo. So, and also, we want to keep the width and height like this. Uh, so, now,"
2603360,2609040," I can just do something like this. So, it's going to be cells. Uh-huh. So, cells. And then, here,"
2609040,2616240," we're going to have width. Here, we're going to have height. So, the thing I want to do, by the way,"
2616240,2625920," I want to have some sort of a getter. Right. So, you do. What's up with that? So, get. So,"
2625920,2630160," that does get has some sort of, like, a special meaning in JavaScript. Does anybody know why is"
2630160,2635680," it highlighted like that? I, I'm, I don't know how to program in JavaScript. Like, I want, I just want"
2635680,2643760," to have a get. Yes. So, what does it mean? What does it mean? Uh, JavaScript get. Well, Chad,"
2643760,2654000," you're so fucking helpful. Thank you for. Classic chats. Okay. So, I'm."
2654000,2665440," Syntax binds an object property to a function that will be called when that property is."
2669360,2680880," Okay. Okay. Okay. So, it's a, ah, ah, ooh, ooh, brav, brav, brav, brav, brav. Okay."
2680880,2689440," I don't like it, but I mean, this is like, why did you take away such a freaking useful"
2689440,2696560," shit from me, bro? Such a freaking useful shit. Anyway, whatever. Okay. I can do get some. Fuck you."
2697600,2701360," So, and in here, what we're going to be doing, we're going to be accepting the coordinates,"
2701360,2705920," the points, which is like, just a vector and shit like that. And we're going to just return the cell"
2705920,2718320," so we can get a cell. Uh, git. Yeah. That's a funny one, actually. Git. Git is when you remove an"
2718320,2725600," element from, from a container. Um, it's like a property decorator in Python. Python has a property"
2725600,2732080," the decorator. Uh, honestly, I never bought into this property stuff in all these languages, so I,"
2732080,2740640," I really don't really care. Um, so if I remember correctly, I remember a properties from C sharp,"
2740640,2746640," I think. Um, yeah. So essentially you can have a property, you can have setters and getters,"
2747280,2751600," and this is just like a syntax sugar for actually calling those things. So,"
2751600,2759600," um, this is actually the syntax sugar for calling them. So anyways, anyway, we can even do something"
2759600,2766800," cool. Right. So cell or undefined. So if you're doing out of bounds, uh, you're going to do it like that."
2767600,2774640," Um, so we can also do something like contains, which accepts this thing and returns you a boolean."
2774640,2781440," Uh, it returns you a boolean. And it's effectively inside scene, right? So it's in fact effectively"
2781440,2789760," inside the scene. Um, and also a scene size is a thing that just computes the size and returns it as a"
2789760,2796800," a vector. Honestly, since we store the size like this, like it's not needed anymore. Right. So yeah,"
2796800,2803200," so it's totally fine. Okay. So let's do, uh, something like this P X and P X is less than width"
2803200,2811840," and, uh, zero less than equals P Y and P Y is less than height. And obviously all of that has to be part of"
2811840,2825120," these, these, these, so, and essentially if, um, you know, these contains P does not contain P we return"
2825120,2833920," and define it. If it does contain P what we're doing, we just do these cells P Y multiplied by height"
2833920,2842720," plus P X and we just return this kind of thing. Uh, these heights. Yeah. That's what we're doing here."
2842720,2849520," That's what we're doing. It's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. Interestingly, do I want to"
2849520,2863200," floor these things? So essentially, um, do I want to do something like this, like a V, uh, F P,"
2863200,2870720," let's call it F P. So you map it with math floor, you map it with math floor. And instead of this kind of"
2870720,2878240," thing, you just use F P F P. I think I kind of want to do that. So essentially you just have a point and"
2878240,2883600," you access the cell at that point, regardless of whether it's like a has fractional part or anything"
2883600,2890080," like that. Uh, right. So it's kind of, it's kind of cool, actually."
2892400,2897280," Uh, right. Just a second."
2897280,2909840," Yeah, that's pretty cool. So maybe the time has come to make a small break. Uh, I think the time"
2909840,2915760," has come to make a small break. I would like to make a cup of tea, honestly, but it's super hot right now."
2915760,2920800," So yeah, I probably won't be able to actually drink it. So yeah, I'm only going to pour myself"
2920800,2925600," like a little bit of water, uh, right. You know, wander around, think about the problem,"
2925600,2929680," and then we're going to continue a little bit later. Right. Let's make some break. And, um,"
2929680,2935520," all right, let's continue. So yeah, we have a scene to, in fact, maybe I'm going to get rid of this"
2935520,2943680," scene. So I want the code to break everywhere. We were using this original scene type. So instead of that"
2943680,2948480," scene type, we're going to be using this one and we'll see if it's going to be convenient or anything."
2948480,2955440," Um, so yeah, we'll already check whether something is inside of scene. So the equivalent of this"
2955440,2962480," function is this one, right? So we don't have to do that. So there's also scene size function."
2962480,2967840," It basically tries to compute the size of the scene. We don't really need that as well."
2968560,2976960," Uh, right. Because now what we can do, we can just do size and we can return a vector of these things."
2976960,2985040," So we return new vector to this width, this height. All right. So let me go through the compilation areas."
2985040,2989520," Right. So I get rid of the previous scene type. I replace it with something else. So everything is broken."
2989520,2994880," So let's do compiler system of the factory. Okay. So this one is pretty cool. Um, scene."
2994880,3004960," You have that. So the cool thing, what we can do now is that scene, um, essentially get cell C."
3006000,3014800," And funnily enough, funnily enough, funnily enough, it will return you undefined in case of this thing"
3014800,3021600," not being available, right? Because that's how this get cell works, right? First of all,"
3021600,3026880," what you have to do is probably check that it's not undefined. Um,"
3027920,3037440," I think it was actually kind of lying. So if it's, we're kind of stopping when this thing is equal to"
3037440,3047760," something, uh, or Emacs, Emacs is actually going crazy right now. I don't know. So it's inside of, um,"
3049200,3058240," so we stop when it's inside of the scene and not equal to null. Uh-huh. So what that means is"
3058240,3069360," seeing gets, uh, cell C not equal to undefined, right? So not equal to undefined and not equal to null."
3069360,3074640," Right. It's kind of interesting. Undefined means that there's no such cell."
3075200,3079760," No means that the cell exists, but it's empty. So it's kind of like we have two separate meaning"
3079760,3086560," for these two things. It's kind of funny actually. So if it's, um, right, we keep continue moving"
3086560,3091680," when it stands. All right. So that, that actually makes sense. Okay. The next error, the next error."
3091680,3098320," So here we get the, uh, scene size. Uh, so we can just do size and that's fine. Uh, all right. So we"
3098320,3108160," get the cell, uh, which is understandable. And then, so we can just do something like get cell new vector"
3108160,3118320," x, y. All right. Next error. Here we check that we're inside of the scene. Okay. This one is rather"
3118320,3132640," interesting actually because we can simply just do that. Get cell C and basically a lacking cell is"
3132640,3140800," going to be one of those things. Yeah. So this is basically what's going on here. We have to align"
3140800,3147360," everything properly. Uh-huh. Okay. This is actually way more convenient. So we get the cell. If it's"
3147360,3151760," cooler, we're going to do one thing. If it's not, we're going to do another thing. If it's snow, we"
3151760,3156800," don't draw anything. And if it's missing, we also don't do anything. Um, all right. So that's actually"
3156800,3164080," kind of cool. That's way better approach in here. So here are the scene size. Uh, I take the size of the"
3164080,3168880," scene and I scale it by the cell size. Okay. So that's also understandable. And here we can strike."
3168880,3175440," Okay. So this one is really interesting. Um, so I need to construct a scene now, right? So it's a new"
3175440,3184240," scene. Uh, and one of the things I pass in there is the cells, but the cells that we accept in here,"
3184240,3193280," it's a flat array, right? As you can see, it is a flat array. Uh, so now what I have to do in here is"
3193280,3198800," probably just do something like this. And I also need to get rid of, uh, all of these things. So I wonder"
3198800,3205920," if I can just do something like that. All right. So that gives me this kind of array. And I need"
3205920,3214560," to know how many columns I have in here. So this is the nine columns. Amount of rows is also rather"
3214560,3225040," interesting. Um, you know what? Yeah, I guess that's fine. So this is going to be, um, I really don't"
3225040,3229920," particularly like that on the sling. I really don't mind that. So width."
3229920,3243040," So this is the seven lines. So that means it's seven, nine and seven. I really don't like"
3243040,3246560," that. I have to compute this kind of shit myself."
3248240,3254640," Uh, right. I really don't fucking like that. So what I probably want to do at least for this"
3254640,3261760," specific constructor is actually go back to this kind of thing and maybe compute width and height"
3261760,3268800," in the constructor itself, and then just start store flattened out thing. Right. So just accept this kind"
3268800,3272400," of thing. And I compute width and height myself in here. You know what I'm talking about?"
3273280,3279840," You know what I'm talking about? So yeah, how we're going to be doing that, uh, is rather interesting."
3279840,3289600," So let me give it a try. Um, so essentially, uh, we can easily identify the height. It's not that big"
3289600,3294240," of a deal. It's just a cell's length. So this is the height. So then we have to compute the width,"
3294240,3300960," and width is going to be the maximum width across all of the rows. Uh, it's going to be the maximum"
3300960,3309200," width across all of the rows. So now, um, what we're going to do, we're going to actually take the"
3309200,3314000," number minimum, like it's a mean value because we're going to be computing the maximum and I'm going to be"
3314000,3320080," iterating through all of the rows. All right. So it's a row in, um, of cells, right? So I suppose this is"
3320080,3328480," how we do that. Um, so, and then what I can do in here is the, is this width math, uh, maximum between"
3328480,3336400," the width, maximum between the width and the row length, uh, length, I set emacs. There we go. So, uh,"
3336400,3344320," and that way we have width and height. So this one is rather interesting because, um, this implies that the"
3344320,3351680," rows can be of different widths, right? So, and the actual width is the maximum one. So what we effectively"
3351680,3359840," are doing, we are allowing the user, we're allowing the user new size to maybe have a little bit less"
3359840,3366560," of these things in here. And the whole thing is going to have the width of the maximum one anyway."
3367440,3374880," That's what we're doing, right? To the people in the chat, who's saying, I just use array flag, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
3374880,3381520," We are taking this kind of case into account, right? So this thing can be of different size."
3381520,3388320," If you do not pad them properly, you can't easily use array flag. Right? Right? Right?"
3389360,3395680," So, uh, we have to be really careful with this kind of shit. Um, so how are we going to be doing all of"
3395680,3401840," that? I suppose we're going to be, um, as we, since we know the, the maximum width and stuff like that,"
3401840,3406480," we're going to be iterating through the rows, uh, yet again, for the second time. Right? So we're going"
3406480,3413280," to be iterating through the rows for the second time. Uh, and, uh, we are going to just append them"
3413280,3418240," into these cells, right? So I suppose initially I can say that this thing is going to be just empty."
3418240,3422560," Um, all right. And how are we going to be appending all that stuff? That's a very interesting question."
3422560,3435680," Um, so can I, uh, do, uh, the thing, so it's not Python. So if I have something like this,"
3436720,3442800," is there any way for me, for example, I can do append or what is it called? Push,"
3442800,3448640," right? So I can push a little bit of this kind of stuff. And that gives me that, uh, and can I now"
3448640,3454880," say five, six, seven, it is not going to actually do this. Yeah. So it's, it's going to do it like that."
3454880,3460640," So we probably need to concat the whole thing. Uh, but it doesn't really matter. Uh, it doesn't really"
3460640,3468640," matter. So what we can do is just cells, um, maybe concat a row. Right. So if I understand"
3468640,3476400," practice one, two, three, uh, concat four, five, six. Okay. So that explains it. Right. And I suppose"
3476400,3482880," I also have to maybe even reassign this kind of thing. Right. So we concatenated this entire stuff."
3482880,3490400," And then, uh, we have to push the tail, sort of speak. We have to push the tail. So what's going"
3490400,3498400," to be the tail in here? Uh, the tail is effectively the width minus the row length. Right. So that's,"
3498400,3504800," that's basically the tail. Uh, and we can do something like this, right? So this is the rest of the stuff."
3505520,3512560," Uh, and we just do push, uh, null in here. And there we go. So that's basically what we're doing."
3512560,3517680," So we, we realign all of that stuff. Right. So we are realigning all of that stuff, hopefully."
3517680,3526160," Okay. So does it compile? Um, so let's actually kill the whole thing. So I removed the compilation"
3526160,3533680," of the thingy. Right. So, okay. Starting compilation and watch mode. It doesn't compile. Right. So we still"
3533680,3539040," have a bunch of things that we need to fix. So next error. So this is a scene size. Uh,"
3539040,3543600," right. So we continue doing with this kind of thing. And, uh, the next thing here in,"
3543600,3548000," so we're checking that we're in. Okay. This one is interesting. So this is what we introduced recently."
3548000,3555840," This is what we introduced recently. And, um, the way we now handle the scenes allows us to just do"
3555840,3562880," get cell new position, and we don't even have to floor this entire thing anymore because it's floored"
3562880,3570080," automatically inside of the get cell, as you can see. And, uh, if this thing is missing,"
3570080,3575120," it's going to just return undefined. And what's funny is that this allows us to replace the whole"
3575120,3584880," thing with the following stuff. If this thing is equal to null or undefined, we just continue. Right. So,"
3586240,3594480," right. We can say equal to null or, uh, undefined. So it would be, it would make sense maybe to just"
3594480,3600640," save it like that. So we do not recompute it over and over again. Uh, uh, undefined like so."
3600640,3607840," All right. So that's looks pretty cool. And, uh, no flight check hours. Everything seems to be working."
3607840,3615360," Everything seems to be working. I hope I didn't break shit. Uh, so let me now try to, um, you know,"
3615360,3623280," to open this and that stuff. So let me open the dev tools. I want to like refresh with cleaning all of"
3623280,3629120," all of the caches and shit. Right. So the, all of the caches are cleaned up and, uh, yeah, something is"
3629120,3635600," absolutely broken. Something is absolutely broken, but not really that much, honestly, not really that"
3635600,3647280," much. So let's actually see if I, uh, made any error in this scene. Um, okay. So, okay. Height is the amount of"
3647280,3655600," these things. Cool. So the width is the maximum among all of the rows, right? So we pick the minimum"
3655600,3661440," value to make sure, right? To make sure that it's going to be picked up. So we find the maximum among"
3661440,3668720," all of these things. Then we take these cells, right? We are assigning like empty array in here and we are"
3668720,3675520," iterating through the rows one more time. So then we take these cells and we're just appending all of the"
3675520,3680080," rows that we have in here into that thing. And we are reassigning it and we're padding the rest of the"
3680080,3689440," stuff with this kind of thing. So I'm not 100% sure, uh, what exactly went wrong with this kind of"
3689440,3696160," generation. Right. So it doesn't look like it, it's kind of close to what we want to do, but not really."
3696160,3702800," Right. It's, it's completely fucked up. So I don't see the problem with this. Like what's, what's"
3702800,3712240," actually the problem? Um, we, we can try to maybe debug this entire thing in a sense that when we do"
3712240,3727360," that, we could print its size. Uh, console log. This width and this height. So what's up with this kind of"
3727360,3743120," thing? Uh, what the fuck are you talking about? Okay. So, uh, all right. So what's up with this shit?"
3747120,3755680," I literally don't see a problem. I literally don't see a problem."
3757520,3768800," So that means the problem maybe somewhere with get. Uh, found it. I was right. There was no problem in the"
3768800,3777520," constructor. Pretty cool. So console. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So that explains it. Fix it. Okay. So the problem was"
3777520,3782400," within the, uh, with, uh, within the get cell perfection. Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice."
3782400,3792240," Uh, all righty. That's pretty poggers. That's pretty poggers. So yeah, we, we still kind of penetrated"
3792240,3797040," through this entire thing, but that's totally fine. So we need to add a little bit of a girthiness into"
3797040,3802480," the, into the player, uh, into the player. So before I add a little bit of a girthiness,"
3802480,3808880," I think I need to maybe do a committee committee, uh, because we just introduced like a whole new type,"
3808880,3813600," uh, for the scene, for managing the scene. And the cool thing about this type is that kind of abstracts"
3813600,3821520," away completely, uh, the way it stores the cells, right? So essentially, if we're going to store the"
3821520,3828800," cells in a more sparse way, uh, we are not going to be changing any of the code that uses the scene,"
3828800,3832000," right? So the code that uses the scene and calls to get cell,"
3832000,3836880," it doesn't really care how exactly the cell is stored. It could be stored in a very sparse way,"
3836880,3842880," right? It may be, uh, like a hash map that maps specific x and y coordinates to a particular cell"
3842880,3847840," and stuff like that. So here we're actually storing everything, but maybe if this scene is super huge,"
3847840,3852800," it's not necessarily going to be like a plain array. It could be maybe some sort of a tree or something."
3852800,3858480," Right. So we'll see, we'll see, but I don't think we're going to have such scenes, uh, because it's going"
3858480,3862880," to be probably a simple, like a browser game. So we don't really need this kind of stuff, but still."
3862880,3872400," Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe. I don't freaking know. Um, okay. So let's do a committee committee chat."
3872400,3883280," Uh, get ready for a fucking committee committee mate. Uh, so introduce, um, refactor the way, um, the way we store"
3884000,3895360," this scene. Um, um, store this scene in the, uh, in a plane array. In a plane array. I'm going to push that"
3895360,3902400," right into the repo. A little committee committee and maybe even a tiny pushy-pushy. Exactly, exactly,"
3902400,3908720," my new friend. So, uh, what we're going to have in here. So we probably need to introduce some sort of a radius"
3908720,3915120," for the player. So I feel like the radius of the player has to be less than a cell"
3915120,3925520," because I want to be able to kind of stand in this sort of like pocket in here, right? So here is the"
3925520,3930960," minimap and in this minimap there is this sort of pocket. I want to be able to stand in this kind of"
3930960,3936880," pockets and maybe, uh, like wander around within this cell, maybe look around and stuff like that."
3936880,3943200," Because of that, the radius of the body of the boundary of the boundary of the player is going"
3943200,3950480," to be less than one because the size of the cell is one. So, which makes it kind of easy to check"
3950480,3956640," whether the player is intersecting anything, right? Because if the radius of the player is less than the"
3958000,3966480," cell, it's not going to be touching more than four of the cell at once. In fact, the way we can check"
3966480,3976000," that, right? So, the way we can even check that, the way we can even check that..."
3983040,3995040," that is kind of interesting. So, maybe we could use an algorithm that checks the intersection of the"
3995040,4008320," square and... not square, but the rect. Is the player round or square? I think the player is round, but we can"
4008320,4016080," try to make it square. So, I'd make a player square rather than a circle. I feel like I want to make it"
4016080,4020560," circle. I feel like I want to make it circle, but we can try to make it square."
4020560,4027200," Um, yeah. So, I feel like square is going to make it a little bit easier to work with."
4027200,4036880," Minecraft style. So, in Minecraft, the boundary box of the player is like squares, right? So, it's basically"
4036880,4042400," a rectangle and stuff like that. We can do that. Why not? I think it's going to be actually fine."
4042400,4048560," Player size, right? So, and the player is going to be square, right? So, and we're going to use size as"
4048560,4055440," width and height as well. So, what's going to be that thing? So, let's say that it's going to be maybe"
4055440,4062800," half, right? So, and I think it has to be reflected in the minimap, right? So, when we are rendering the minimap,"
4063680,4069280," we're rendering the player in here, the position of the player. So, yeah, as you can see, we just do"
4069280,4077120," the circle of the player, right? We just do the circle of the player. But let's try to do the rectangle."
4077120,4085040," So, ctx fill erect. So, it's going to be ctx and we take the position of the player. So, this is a player"
4085040,4093200," position x minus half of the player size. So, essentially, within the boundary box of the player,"
4093200,4098640," within the boundary box of the player, the position of the player is going to be at the center, right? So,"
4098640,4103440," this is going to be at the center. So, because of that, so, when we are rendering the center, I think"
4103440,4110960," we're subtracting half of the player size from x. And in terms of y, we're also subtracting half of"
4110960,4117920," the player size. Might as well even do something like this. So, and then width and height is going to be"
4117920,4124880," player size, player size, like so. And this is how we fill the rectangle. So, and I want it to be sort of"
4124880,4132400," reflected in a mini map, right? So, okay. Do we see shit in here? We can't see shit in this mist, which is"
4132400,4141920," kind of surprising, honestly. So, maybe because it's so goddamn small. So, there is, okay, so there is a"
4141920,4151280," problem in here player size. You don't like the player size. What? What? What? What? What? Because,"
4151280,4157840," yeah, you don't do it like that. I see, I see. So, that explains it. Yeah, there we go. So, this is the"
4157840,4166160," size of the player. This is the size of the player. So, it's kind of like makes it difficult to see the"
4169280,4177600," the field of view of the player, unless we actually increase the near clipping plane to something a"
4177600,4183680," little bit bigger, maybe half. Yeah. So, let's refresh. Yeah. So, now we can kind of see that."
4183680,4186480," Yeah, there we go. So, that makes sense."
4186480,4192720," So, but I have a feeling that it would be kind of better if the player was actually kind of circle"
4195840,4203200," from the field point of view. Yeah. So, it's already starting. So, the near clipping plane has to be"
4203200,4212800," like a quarter, I think, for it to work a little bit better. It's already... Oh, yeah. I forgot to do this."
4217040,4225520," Maybe it has to be even smaller, right? It has to be within the boundary for it to work properly. I feel... Yeah, yeah, yeah."
4225520,4232480," Okay. So, we can't see the FOV of the player, because it's within the boundary of the player. So,"
4232480,4237520," and because of that, when we actually implement the collision, you know, colliding with the walls"
4237520,4242320," is going to work fine. Okay. That's kind of a funny way to do that, but I'm fine with that, sure."
4243040,4247680," It's just like, I kind of don't like that I can't see FOV in the minimap, but we can have like a fake"
4247680,4253200," clipping plane to just show the cone, if you know what I'm talking about, right? We can have a fake"
4253200,4257680," thing in there. Anyway, so what we can do..."
4257680,4268080," We can now, since the size of the player is smaller than the cell, we can just check four points and check"
4268080,4275520," if we intersect with any of the walls or anything like that. So, to be fair, maybe we could even implement"
4275520,4287200," something like sin and like is_wall p vector 2, which returns a boolean. And the way we can do that is"
4287200,4300240," essentially this get_cell p not equal to null and this get_cell. We might as well even extract it to a"
4300240,4313120," separate C in here. C not equal to undefined. Right. Something like this. Right. Is_wall, which makes it possible to do"
4313120,4325760," things like this: sin_is_wall_new_position. Yeah, we can do shit like this now. So, this is the new"
4325760,4330800," position, but within the new position we need to figure out the four points in there, right? So,"
4331840,4339280," essentially what we can do, we can do a new position and honestly player_size."
4339280,4351120," What if we treat the player_size more like mu_vector_05? Something like this, but we can't construct it."
4351120,4361200," But it's just like what I want you to do is essentially subtract, you know, mu_vector_2 player_size"
4361200,4366720," player_size half of this entire thing and it's just like not particularly convenient."
4366720,4378560," So, what I was thinking, it would be kind of cool if vector had a constructor that constructs a thing"
4378560,4387520," from a single component like this, so I can then scale it by half and then subtract."
4387520,4392320," Like, what would be a better name for this kind of constructor? So, single basically takes this thing"
4392320,4401360," and fills up both x and y with that value. I think single is, you know, okay. Maybe, okay, from scaler."
4404560,4411360," Fill. But fill is not a constructor. Fill is a modifier of an existing container, so it's not going to work."
4411360,4417200," It's not going to work. So, I think from scaler is actually a better class."
4417200,4422400," Vector2. Okay. So, because we have... Oh, we even have this kind of stuff. So, 0."
4422400,4427360," So, vector... Okay. So, I think I know how to call that scaler."
4428480,4434640," Scalar. And we're going to have a value and number. And I just return the vector to..."
4434640,4441840," All right. So, now I just return new vector, value, value, like so."
4441840,4451040," So, it was called from scaler. Scalar. Yeah. So, vector size, scale by half."
4451600,4454240," And since we have a scaler, we can actually make it shorter."
4454240,4460400," You don't need to scale anything. And then we subtract this entire thing and we have like a left"
4460400,4469360," point in that. So, now I could probably save this entire thing to something as just like a... It's"
4469360,4477520," more like a corner, if you know what I mean. So, and then we can simply like iterate all possible"
4477520,4485120," combinations. Right. So, 0, 1 and stuff like that. So, how can we even do that? So, we can have x,"
4485120,4491440," which starts at 0 and less than 2. Right. So, because I want it to be 0, 1. Right. So, in here,"
4491440,4499760," we're going to have y like this. So, and that's basically offset. I would even call it like dx,"
4500960,4509200," not even x, just dx and dy. Right. So, and the vector that I'm interested in is dx and dy."
4509200,4514080," So, in a corner, I would like to maybe add this entire thing, but at the same time, I would like to"
4514080,4522320," maybe scale this entire stuff by the player size. Right. So, I scale it by the player size and then I"
4522320,4529920," add it to the corner. And this is like one of the values that I have in there. And if sin is a wall,"
4530800,4538560," we don't want to move in there. Which implies, which implies that this entire thing has to be"
4538560,4547120," some sort of the, some sort of the function. Right. It has to be some sort of a function."
4547120,4552960," What kind of function should it be? Right. So, it's a function that accepts a new position,"
4554000,4562640," new position, which is a vector 2. So, it probably also accepts the sin. Right. It also accepts the sin."
4562640,4568880," And it returns you a boolean, which means, right, it checks whether you can go there."
4568880,4580240," Can you, can player go there? Good name, good name for a function. So, and this entire thing is going to be"
4580240,4587680," basically part of this function. Right. So, we have a new position, you have a sin and stuff like that."
4587680,4594880," If, in that specific corner, you find something that is a wall, you insert your film false, and then here"
4594880,4598240," insert your turn true. Something like this. It's like a very dumb, simple function."
4599120,4606800," And now, can player, I want to grab this entire thing. So, we figured out the new position. We"
4606800,4612480," pass the sin there, we pass the new position there, and we, if we can't go there, we assign the new"
4612480,4617680," position there. We can't go there, we don't do anything. So, that's basically what we can do. I ran"
4617680,4625040," out of floor, unfortunately. But anyway. So, let me, let me see. Does it compile? It seems to be compiling."
4625040,4631360," Everything seems to be working. Everything seems to be twerking. So, yeah. It's, it works. Look at that."
4631360,4639600," It kind of works, actually. Yeah. So, if it was like a circle, I think it would be a little bit easier,"
4639600,4647920," because you could sort of like slide around this entire stuff. Yeah. I think, I think that would be"
4647920,4654560," much easier, but this also works for now. Right. This also works. So, as you can see, I can, like,"
4654560,4661600," wander around within that pocket and do some different stuff. But it would be way better if the"
4661600,4668560," player was a circle, honestly. Just the same. I think it would be way better. Right. But we still"
4668560,4674080," have this kind of thing. We still have this kind of thing. So, that's pretty cool. That's pretty cool."
4674080,4686480," That's pretty cool. So, yeah. Let's do a committee committee. All right. Excuse me. Jesus Christ."
4688160,4702640," So, get sell, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay. Give player bounding box. Give player the bounding box."
4702640,4705520," One thing I probably want to do, actually."
4709760,4721360," Try circle boundary instead of a box. I think for a player it would be much better. I think for a"
4721360,4725600," player it would be much better, but I don't really want to spend that much time figuring out how to do,"
4725600,4729520," how to do circle and stuff like that, because we already have something that works. It doesn't really"
4729520,4736640," feel good, but we can always fix that. Right. So, let me do the following thing. So, I'm going to"
4736640,4741920," actually amend that because I didn't push anything. So, let's push that right into the repo. Okay."
4741920,4744800," That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool."
4744800,4752880," So, what else do we need? What else do we need in this entire stuff? Maybe we could try to implement"
4752880,4760320," floors and shit. Implementing floor should be pretty easy, honestly. Right. So, you just"
4761760,4768640," do what? Where is the render game? So, you render the scene. You render in the minimap. Before you render"
4768640,4775920," the scene, you can always do some interesting stuff like ""ctx.feelRect"" and you basically fill"
4775920,4781680," bottom half with some sort of a color, right? You fill the bottom half with some sort of a color."
4783280,4792000," So, and what that color is going to be? So, position is going to be x0 in terms of y. It is going to be"
4792000,4800640," half of the height. So, we take height and we take half of the height like this. In terms of width,"
4800640,4805760," it is going to be the entirety of the width. This is the entirety of the width. And in terms of the height,"
4805760,4810560," the height is going to be half of the height, right? So, it's like at the bottom pinion here. So, and then"
4810560,4818720," we can do ""ctx.feel.style"" and we can maybe make the scene, I think, a little bit more bright than the"
4818720,4826800," background. And this basically becomes the floor or the sky. Right. So, and if I refresh... Yeah, there we go."
4826800,4834480," So, that was easy. So, floor is super easy. If it's a solid color. If it is a solid color, it is super easy."
4834480,4839920," And since it's a sky, we could have actually... Actually, we could have swapped this around. So,"
4839920,4845120," the sky is a little bit more bright in that specific color. Yeah. So, that makes a little bit more sense."
4845120,4852160," That makes a little bit more sense. And maybe for this thing, we could have just used like a bluish color."
4852160,4858960," But unfortunately, talking about the specific hues is not convenient. It is not convenient"
4858960,4868160," in... Because... Yeah, in RGB, right? So, because we're talking about RGB. We probably want to do HSV"
4868160,4872800," in this specific case, right? So, that means we need to introduce some HSV. So, we have a color,"
4872800,4878560," honestly, which is RGB. It's RGBA. You know what I'm thinking? You know what I'm thinking? So,"
4878560,4887280," let's actually query replace color with RGBA. Yeah. So, that's what we're going to have. This is RGBA now."
4887280,4897680," So, then we can have HSV. Yeah. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, generally, to have it like that. But,"
4897680,4904160," I mean, it's fine, I guess. So, class HSV. So, and as far as I know,"
4905440,4911600," the style has HSV, right? So, CSS, HSV."
4911600,4919680," CSS, it's HSL. Okay. Okay. HSL. So, it's not HSV. But do you have HSV?"
4919680,4925360," Eh, it doesn't really matter, right? So, it's pretty much the same thing. There are some differences, but"
4926160,4931440," it's fine. So, there is also HSLA. So, for the alpha, so you can have transparency and stuff like that."
4931440,4937360," Yeah. That's, that's literally how we feel right now, right? Don't know."
4937360,4942560," All right. All right. All right. All right. So,"
4942560,4952800," HSLA. So, it's going to be H. And what are the parameters, right? So, they are percents or something,"
4952800,4958320," right? So, they are percents. And in case of HSLA, it's like from 0 to 1. Okay. So, that makes sense."
4958320,4963200," Though the first parameter is not percent. Look at that. It is not percent. What is it? Do they say?"
4963200,4969760," What is the hue? Hue is a degree from 0 to 360. Okay. So, that makes sense."
4969760,4973280," That makes sense. That makes sense. Okay. So, this is a number."
4974880,4984000," H, S, L, A. All right. And so, let's just create the constructors. I'm sure if I want to copy paste"
4984000,4990960," this entire stuff, but I mean, whatever. Let's just copy paste this thing. H, S, L, A."
4990960,5003360," H, can I just do some H, S, L. And there we go. So, and another thing we can have in here is probably the"
5003360,5018800," style. It's probably the style. And here is just H. So, HSLA. H, S, L, A. So, we also have floors in here."
5018800,5026160," Do we want to have floors in here? I'm not 10% sure. I'm actually not 10% sure."
5027360,5032240," Why am I, why the fuck am I doing that? Can anybody explain me why the fuck I'm having this class?"
5032240,5040160," If I could have just like, uh, render scene. Actually, render game. I could have just like,"
5040160,5042880," directly used this shit in here. Like, what the fuck is wrong with me?"
5042880,5049360," Anyway, whatever. Like, let's forget that you saw anything in here. All right. So, this is zero."
5050720,5055840," Uh, so, saturation. We're going to have like a fair amount of saturation. Like, maybe 100%."
5055840,5060160," Uh, lightness. I don't think we're going to have too much lightness. Uh, right. So, we're going to"
5060160,5066480," percent and here it's going to have one. Uh, right. So, this is red. If I remember correctly, the degrees"
5066480,5075200," of hue zero is red. So, we'll have to adjust it to be, uh, yeah. I didn't want to close this. I think,"
5075200,5081680," wait a second. Yeah. F5. Yeah. So, this is red. And what I want to do, I want to kind of maybe"
5081680,5094320," 20. So, this is, uh, yeah. So, this is greenish. Maybe 220. Uh-huh. Come on. Yeah. Something like that."
5094960,5099440," Um, so, it's, to be fair, it's a little bit too saturated. Let's actually desaturate this thing."
5099440,5107040," So, maybe 60% of the saturation. 60%. So, did it work? It doesn't feel like 60%. Maybe, maybe less."
5107040,5111920," Like, what about 20% of the saturation? Yeah. That's better. That's better. And maybe because of that,"
5111920,5115920," in terms of lightness, it has to be kind of desaturated and light. So, it's going to be like very,"
5115920,5123520," yeah. So, not that much. Maybe like 30%. I need some sort of a color picker maybe. Yeah. So,"
5123520,5129280," I want it to be sort of like grayish, like that. Disgusting. Dirty. Dirty. Dirty fucking skymate."
5129280,5133040," Dirty. Yeah. That looks much better. I think. I think that looks much better."
5133040,5140560," So, we've got some subs. Thank you so much, uh, Belysarith for gifting us up. Thank you. Thank you."
5140560,5146080," Thank you. I really appreciate that. It's a very cool, very cool gifting subs and shits of gifting subs and"
5146080,5152160," shits. Okay. So, yeah. As you can see, it's super easy if you have solid colors. But what if I want the,"
5152160,5162000," um, the floor to have a texture? Um, looks like a default skybox color. Yeah, I know. It also feels a"
5162000,5167680," little bit like more windish, if you know what I'm talking about. It kind of feels a little bit more"
5167680,5175840," windish. I don't know why, but it does. It kind of does. So anyway, um, so what if you want your floor to"
5175840,5182000," be a fucking texture mate, mate? Uh, fabulous floor. Thank you so much for, uh, for the subscription,"
5182000,5192080," for the subscription, for the subscription. Uh, so yeah. So how do you fucking do the textures and stuff?"
5192080,5198080," And what's interesting is that in the article, in the article that inspired this entire stuff,"
5198080,5204880," let's actually take a look at the article. Um, let's take a look at the article. Um,"
5204880,5212960," so yeah, this one is pretty easy. Uh, nothing particularly special. Yeah. So this is just the"
5212960,5220000," texture. So, uh, part two. Yeah. Look at that. Like, how do you achieve this kind of shit? Look at that. Cool."
5220000,5226400," Scheiße. Look at that. Cool. Scheiße. Uh, right. So maybe there are some other examples. I didn't read the"
5226400,5231280," second part, by the way, so I have no idea how you do this kind of shit. Um, but I have a couple of"
5231280,5239600," ideas on this one. I have a couple of ideas on how you do that. So essentially I feel like, I feel like"
5240560,5250160," the way you do that is similarly to, uh, ray casting, scanning vertically, but now you're scanning"
5250160,5258240," horizontally. Now you're scanning horizontally. Let me show you what I mean. So, um, so we're, I'm sorry,"
5258240,5265520," was it too loud? I hope it was not too loud. Um, so yeah, I hit the mic. I'm really sorry about it."
5266960,5276480," Uh, so. All right. All right. All right. It's okay. Okay. Thank you so much. So you have some,"
5276480,5281760," maybe I already have a grid, but I mean, it's kind of a lane grid. I don't like it. It's okay. I died."
5281760,5292800," Sure. Sure. Kappa. Uh, so when you have a player, when you have a player, you have this cone,"
5296640,5304000," you have this cone that looks like this. Uh, it looks like shit on this. So let's put it this way."
5304000,5312320," Right. So imagine that you have a separate layer that, um, keeps track of the textures of the tiles."
5312320,5320560," Right. So the texture of the tiles. So essentially now you know this sort of like vectors and stuff like"
5320560,5330080," that you can now scan the scene with these lines, right? You basically scan the scene with these lines"
5330080,5338400," and look, so as you scan the scene with this line, you take a look at the point and that specific line"
5338400,5345520," and look at that point. You are within this texture. You are within the structure. You can take the pixel of"
5345520,5355840," this thing and you can now remap all of these lines to here, right? So essentially this line that is super"
5355840,5364320," close to the player is the bottom line. The next one, this line is the next line and so on and so forth."
5364320,5368720," Like you basically scanning it like that and you're scanning them in here. And as you scan them,"
5368720,5375120," you know precisely the core of the pixel that you have to put on that specific line because it's within"
5375120,5382960," the cell within the texture. So yeah, this is basically like a scan lines. This is my hypothesis"
5382960,5388720," on how to do that. I don't know what's the correct algorithm and I didn't read the second part."
5388720,5396000," They don't even have any pictures on how to do that. Like in the previous tutorial, they just had some"
5396000,5401600," pictures that demonstrated how to do that. Here they didn't demonstrate sh*t, which is kind of sad."
5401600,5408640," But this is my first sort of like hypothesis on how to do that. And this is what I want to try."
5408640,5415040," And it might fail, right? So that's totally fine. So if I fail, I may try to read this entire thing"
5415040,5419680," just to see how it goes. But I feel like that's a reasonable way to do that. What do you guys think?"
5420400,5426000," What do you guys think? I think it's a reasonable way to do. So it's only the problem is that it depends"
5426000,5433040," on your vertical resolution, you may actually go really, really far. So you kind of need to limit"
5433040,5438320," your vertical resolution. So what's your vertical resolution? Right now we don't even have a limit"
5438320,5444560," for vertical resolution. It's just like whatever the height of the canvas, right? But now we'll have to"
5444560,5451920," introduce that so we know how far we have to go. So this is something that we need to do. Sounds"
5451920,5458560," plausible. Yeah, I do think so. I also do think so. So yeah, let's make a small break. I'm going to"
5458560,5465040," refill my water and stuff like that. And after the break, I'm going to try to implement this floor and"
5465040,5470000," ceiling algorithm. And ceiling algorithm is probably the same. It's just like you do that from opposite"
5470000,5476880," direction, right? So we just go towards the middle, right? So makes sense to me? Makes sense to me."
5476880,5487200," Anyways, right. Let's make a small break. And okay, so what we need to do, let's go ahead. Maybe we're"
5487200,5495120," going to even pretend that the entirety of the floor is covered with the same texture. I think that's a good"
5495120,5502000," idea. So let's actually see what kind of textures we can have. So here's, this is a very cool pack"
5502000,5508800," that I would like to maybe try. So for example, maybe they're too bright, honestly, for whatever we're"
5508800,5517760," trying to do in here. But maybe that's totally fine. So there's a wall, grass and your mom's ass."
5517760,5524160," Sorry. So let me let me see. So it's going to be game art."
5524160,5532000," Okay, so we're going to have credit in here. And let's actually download this entire thing."
5540400,5545840," Oh, I should have actually put 1% at the end. We can't see the progress of the fucking downloading,"
5545840,5552560," mate. We won't know when it's finished downloading. So it's 21 fucking megabyte, mate. Okay, so..."
5552560,5559120," Fuck. Okay, I'll have to try that one more time because we don't have any progress. All right. So"
5559120,5568560," show me the progress, mate. Okay, so we see some sort of progress. 20 megabytes is actually quite a decent"
5568560,5577920," size. It's quite a decent size. So, okay, so let's open it. This is not what I want."
5577920,5583680," Yeah, it's a z-bomb. Like, why are Windows users doing that? Like, why don't you have like a root folder"
5583680,5590160," in your things? Like, I don't understand. Okay, so I'm gonna just put this stuff in here and I'm gonna"
5590160,5598320," maybe move this thing in here and I'm gonna just unzip it. Okay, so that's what we got. Uh-huh."
5598320,5604560," Like, I think I know why Windows users do that because the Windows itself actually automatically"
5604560,5612880," creates a folder. Okay, so there's a dirt, grass. It's too realistic, honestly. Ooh."
5614480,5627520," Leaves. Panels. Paving. Okay, so this... Yeah, this is too bright. Planks. Okay. Snow. Stone."
5627520,5633920," Okay, I think I'm gonna take the planks. Mm-hmm. So let's grab the planks."
5636320,5646160," Let's grab the planks. So index ts. Mm-hmm. Let's load some stuff. Planks. Wait."
5646160,5660400," Load image data. Load image data. All right. And planks like so. All right. So, and we're gonna catch this stuff."
5661440,5668640," And if we couldn't load this entire stuff, so it's going to become purple. So, to test that we loaded"
5668640,5675200," it correctly, I'm gonna actually use it for walls super quick. Uh, do we have... Okay, so we do have this thing."
5675200,5684960," Let's refresh. Uh, okay. So, looks like shit, by the way. Looks like scheisse, but maybe that's fine."
5685840,5691920," Maybe that's fine. So, there's, like, there's no anti-aliasing or anything. So, it's just kind of..."
5691920,5697040," It's kind of weird overall. Yeah. So, the fact that I kind of get stuck on the corners,"
5697040,5701920," right? So, sometimes I get, like, really stuck on the corners. This is one of the reasons why I think"
5701920,5709200," the player has to be circle, right? So, you don't kind of stuck on that. Um, yeah. So, that's one"
5709200,5715920," thing we need to do. I don't like this section, honestly. I really don't like it. So, rock, uh, sand,"
5715920,5725680," stone, stone wall. Let's use stone wall, right? So, this is going to be, like, yet another sort of, like,"
5726480,5734000," stone wall in here, but it's a different one. So, it is totally fine. Okay. So, let's call it just"
5734000,5742320," floor, in that case. So, the name is sort of, like, the material independent."
5742320,5750160," Okay. Yeah, that looks like... So, yeah. Now, if the floor is this, it's going to look all right. And it's"
5750160,5754240," not going to be a final floor, because it's too bright, right? So, there's lighting on top of this thing."
5754240,5760960," So, it's just, eh, kind of meh. Kind of meh. Oh, and by the way, I just got reminded that we have"
5760960,5768800," normal maps for this thing. So, I probably need to leave a to-do about that. To-do, try normal,"
5768800,5781920," try lighting with normal maps that come with some of the assets. I think that's an interesting,"
5782960,5786880," That's an interesting thing to try, honestly. I think that's an interesting thing to try."
5786880,5794640," Because, as we already discovered at the beginning of the stream. So, some of the things they do have..."
5794640,5802560," Where? Yeah. So, they do have normal maps. So, they come with normal maps, which is kind of an interesting"
5802560,5810400," thing to use for raycaster. I don't think people use normal maps for raycasters. Like, I don't think it's"
5810400,5817200," a thing. Right. Because the normal maps were invented, like, way after people stopped doing raycasting."
5817920,5820880," So, it's kind of a funny thing to try."
5820880,5828080," There's an idea for depth, right? These are for lighting. Well, I mean, they kind of like..."
5828880,5837360," So, the normal maps, how they work. Each pixel of a normal map encodes a vector of a normal. So,"
5837360,5843520," and you can use that vector of a normal to sort of compute the lighting on the level of a pixel of"
5843520,5851440," the texture. Which kind of gives this, you know, a surface like a fake, you know, fake tessellation or"
5851440,5860720," something like that. So, I don't know. Right. I'm not really, you know, engine developers. Like,"
5860720,5868400," I don't know the terminology or how to explain that, but whatever. Okay. So, I suppose what we need to do,"
5868400,5873280," right? So, we have a screen width. We also need to introduce the screen height, right? So,"
5873280,5879040," because we're going to have a limited amount of rows that we're doing. So, let's actually go ahead"
5879040,5883920," and do that. So, we have a screen height. So, let's say the screen height is 200. Like, just because I"
5883920,5890720," introduced it, obviously, it's not going to be used. Right. So, render scene. Right. So, we have a render scene."
5890720,5903040," And so, yeah, we just use a strip height. So, and this one is rather interesting. This one is rather"
5903040,5911200," interesting. So, right now we're using height of the screen as the canvas height. So, what we have to do,"
5911200,5917760," we have to now replace it with a screen height. And it's going to fuck up the entirety of the rendering."
5917760,5926640," So, screen height. Where is the another CTX canvas height? So, this is another place. So, I suppose I"
5926640,5940320," probably have to maybe create a CTX canvas height with screen height. Right. So, yeah. So, it's kind of an"
5940320,5949680," interesting thing. So, it's definitely going to fuck up, like, everything. So, let me see. Yeah. So, it's actually"
5949680,5955920," squashed it in a really funny way. Yeah. So, it literally squashed it. So, one of the things we need"
5955920,5966000," to do now is to probably remap, is to probably remap this height to something else. So, what effectively"
5966000,5974160," I'm doing I'm just like changing the resolution and stuff. And I'm not sure if it's a generally good"
5974160,5981120," idea to do it like that. So, maybe it is not a good idea. So, in here, what I have to do now is"
5982320,5989680," I just have to remap the whole thing to the full screen. And, like, I have to do that on each file"
5989680,5996320," rect and also on each draw image. And it's kind of a pain in the ass, honestly. I really don't want to do"
5996320,6008080," that. But I have to. I kind of have to. So, in case of a strip width, where do we do this sort of mapping?"
6009040,6014480," Yeah. So, this is a... So, that makes sense. So, this is a strip width. And this is where we"
6014480,6025200," we did the whole thing. So, in here, I should have just called it strip height. But this is not a strip"
6025200,6030640," height. This is another parameter. All right. So, I don't really know how to call this parameter."
6030640,6037600," The strip height is already taken by something else in here. Right. Strip height is already taken"
6037600,6047440," by something else. But this one is maybe pixel height. Right. So, because of that, if I'm using"
6047440,6054560," this notation, this thing should be also called pixel width and pixel height. So, we're rendering"
6054560,6060480," with a, like, in a really low resolution and we're remapping everything into, like, rectangles and stuff"
6060480,6067680," like that. So, that's basically what we're doing in here. So, ctx canvas, you know, height. Right. So,"
6067680,6076160," I take the height and I should divide screen height by that. So, and I do a ceiling here, which is totally"
6076160,6082640," fine. So, I want to quickly replace strip width with pixel width, like so. Right. So, we do it like that."
6083440,6090960," That's pretty cool. Uh-huh. That's pretty cool. So, seal, it's not cell, it's a seal in here. All right."
6090960,6099360," That's pretty poggers. So, in here. So, we figured out this kind of stuff, figured out this kind of stuff. And"
6100080,6110080," we just multiply this thing by pixel height. We're just multiplying it by pixel height. And within the"
6110080,6118400," here. So, the width is one single pixel in here. And these things should also be multiplied by the pixel"
6118400,6127440," height. So, effectively what we're doing in here is rather interesting. So, we're rendering in a different"
6127440,6134160," scaling in a different mapping. Which means that we can probably use the context"
6134160,6140480," translation and scaling as we do with the rendering in a minimap. So, we don't have to do this manual"
6140480,6151200," mapping of the things. But I want to do the mapping manually anyway. So, then when I introduce the actual"
6151200,6156880," context mapping, like with translates and scales and stuff like that, I know that they didn't break anything."
6156880,6160640," Right. So, first I want to do that manually. And then I'm going to just use something else later."
6160640,6167200," Anyways. Anyways. So, I'm drawing the image, but I'm drawing the image slightly differently in here. So,"
6167200,6174640," this is the... In the draw image, the first things are the source. So, this is the source."
6174640,6182080," X, Y, width and height. And this one is the destination, right? So, this thing is"
6182080,6188560," multiplied by pixel width. This one should be multiplied by pixel height. And this one also should be"
6188560,6195440," multiplied by pixel height. So, I accidentally put a comma in here. So, that's not the difference."
6195440,6201040," Are you happy now? So, comma should be actually here. All right. So, and when I do rect in here,"
6201760,6208240," when I do rect in here, I think it should also be multiplied by pixel height. And this one should be"
6208240,6213680," also multiplied by pixel height. All right. So, do we have any errors in here? We don't have any errors in"
6213680,6226000," here. Okay. Let's go. Cool. I actually fixed everything. And the height is... Yeah. So, now we are rendering"
6226000,6235280," with a smaller height, surprisingly. Believe it or not. So, if I reduce the height to 100, is it going to change much?"
6238480,6247840," It actually doesn't change much. Probably... Yeah. Probably all of that stuff doesn't matter."
6247840,6250160," So, what if I say that this thing is like 10?"
6250160,6260160," Yeah. Let me take a look at errors. I think I know why visually it doesn't change that much."
6261120,6266400," Because of the fractional parts, right? So, the fractional part of the pixels, like, it doesn't"
6266400,6272800," really change that much. So, it just like looks fine. It kind of looks fine. One of the things to"
6272800,6277680," actually bring... Like, what I was expecting actually is a little bit of a jittering."
6277680,6283120," Right. So, but because we kind of take into account the fractional parts and stuff like that, there is no"
6283120,6289360," that much jittering. So, it's kind of fine. One of the things we can introduce that is by actually"
6289360,6297280," flooring the coordinates and stuff like that. Right. So, we can actually floor them. So, let me,"
6297280,6303760," let me try to see. So, I think I forgot to acknowledge fabulous flow. Oh, no. I actually did"
6303760,6310080," acknowledge you. So, thank you so much for the time. All right. So, let me, let me think. So, render"
6310080,6318080," this scene. Yeah. So, this is render the scene. Actually, I think it was render the scene. Yeah."
6318080,6330480," So, if I now... So, this is just drawing the image. We could just do maybe math floor. Right. So, this is a math floor."
6331120,6340960," And this one is a math floor. Uh-huh. So, I want this entire thing act like it's actually rendered"
6340960,6347040," with like a low resolution. That's what I'm trying to do, honestly. Though, I don't think it's a"
6347040,6352880," generally good idea to do it like that. So, and this is a width and height. So, in case of a width and"
6352880,6363200," height we probably want to actually do seal. Yeah. So, this is a width and height. Okay. So,"
6363200,6368240," this is just images and rectangle in here. Let's remove the rectangle. So, here's the interesting"
6368240,6375520," trick, by the way. I'm drawing a semi-transparent rectangle on top of this strip with texture to"
6375520,6381840," sort of like shade it. Right. I can't modify the shade of the of the strip of the image directly."
6381840,6389200," Right. So, I just put something on top of it. Right. So, let's not modify this thing and let me see if it is..."
6389200,6395760," Does it feel low res? It feels like nothing changes, honestly."
6395760,6405680," Kind of hard to tell. All right. Because now, if I put like 50 height, screen height is now 50."
6408080,6411440," Yeah. Now, nothing fucking changes. All right. Whatever."
6411440,6417040," So, let's get rid of that. So, doesn't... None of that matters. None of that matters."
6417040,6424400," Anyways. So, why am I doing all that? I want to have like a limited width to work with."
6424400,6429520," But I want to have a limited width to work with. So, I kind of know"
6430880,6435440," for how far I have to go. How far I have to go."
6435440,6443520," So, let me open my paint. So, this one is rather interesting."
6447120,6451840," So, let me create the grid."
6451840,6458960," So, we're still live. Yes, we're still live."
6461680,6466880," I want to try this floor thingy. I want to try to figure it out."
6466880,6472240," Because it's kind of an interesting problem, honestly. It's kind of an interesting problem."
6472240,6479440," Okay. So, here's the player. And the player has this kind of stuff."
6479440,6485280," So, as we're doing the ray tracing. So, one interesting thing is that"
6486160,6493840," the height of the strip that we're putting on the screen is actually proportional"
6493840,6498160," to the height of the screen itself. So, essentially,"
6498160,6509280," what do we do? So, strip height. We take the screen height, take the screen height, and divide it by the"
6509280,6512480," distance to the obstacle that we're fucking rendering."
6513360,6521840," So, that means if the distance of the obstacle is equal to the screen height, right, and becomes bigger,"
6521840,6528080," that means this thing becomes size of a single pixel and less than a single pixel. So, it completely"
6528080,6536240," disappears, right? So, how far you can see actually depends on the height of your screen. So, that's"
6536240,6547440," basically what it means, I think, right? So, that means if the object is too far away, further away"
6547440,6556000," than your screen, you won't be able to see it. So, that actually means that this entire stuff will disappear"
6558720,6568640," as we... yeah, if I just say that the height of the screen is like 5, this entire sheet theoretically should"
6568640,6578080," disappear after like 5. But it doesn't actually. Right, and I think it's more than 5 cells. That's for"
6578080,6584080," sure. We're further away more than 5. So, something isn't correct in here. Something is definitely not"
6584080,6591680," correct in here. And I'm not really sure why. So, if I do the height like 2. Right, so this entire stuff"
6591680,6598800," should already disappear, but it doesn't and I don't really understand. Right, so why? Because we're"
6598800,6605920," clearly dividing this kind of stuff. We're clearly dividing, but it just like doesn't work the way I would"
6605920,6613600," expect it to work. So, it's almost like this entire thing is ignored. So, let me see. Yeah. So, this is a strip"
6613600,6624720," height, right? So, and we just like... yeah. So, if this length becomes too far away... it's kind of weird."
6624720,6636000," And, yeah, does anybody have any idea why? Right, so this is the distance to the obstacle and..."
6636000,6645200," Yeah, I don't really understand why it's... what if you round it? It doesn't explain anything. This is not what I'm asking."
6645200,6660720," That is instance of RGBA. Okay, so it doesn't matter. So, instance of image element, the same thing. The same thing, absolutely the same."
6660720,6669280," So, well, canvas context is scaled, isn't it? So, you draw zero one thing and it's like 50 pixels."
6672080,6679120," Oh, probably. Maybe. So, yeah, because of the scaling. Oh, so that's what you mean about the rounding."
6679120,6684240," Right, so that's what you mean about the rounding. But I tried to round these things and it didn't help."
6684240,6690000," So, that means I need to round it again. Okay, so let's give it a try. I see what you mean. So,"
6690000,6698000," I didn't understand the thing about the rounding at first. I assume that it's a browser cache. I actually do"
6698000,6703840," control 5 every time I refresh. So, that should kill the browser cache."
6703840,6710400," So, and let's also floor these things as well, I suppose."
6710400,6723760," So, since it's scaled... Yeah, yeah. Since it is scaled... Okay, so..."
6723760,6733200," So, it doesn't help. It doesn't help. It doesn't help whatsoever."
6733200,6743200," It doesn't help whatsoever. So, that means I do not fully understand this entire thing."
6746720,6756240," too heavy. All right. Because I need to know for how far I want to go with this kind of thing. I need"
6756240,6762240," to know for how far I need to go. You know what? I'm already streaming for two and a half of an hour. I"
6762240,6768720," think I'm going to leave it for tomorrow. All right. So, I'm probably going to do that as a footnote for the session."
6769360,6776400," Right. So, it's really hot in here. When it's hot, I can't think. And I already stream for too long. So,"
6776400,6782720," I'm obviously getting tired. So, let's wrap up. Let's wrap up. Thanks everyone who's watching me right now."
6782720,6788080," I really appreciate it. Have a good one. And I see you all on the next recreation programming session with"
6788080,6790000," Amista Zozin. Love you."
6791760,6797600," This is the next day. Right. So, I slept a little bit. And so, let's continue. Let's continue. So,"
6797600,6804720," what we need to do. We need to actually finally develop proper floor and ceiling. Right. Because"
6804720,6810160," right now we have this kind of stupid skybox. But all of that is just like a rectangle and stuff like that."
6811440,6821040," So, to do that, I think I need to do a proper mapping of the of the pixels or like sort of speak. So,"
6821040,6827040," originally. So, I have a function called render scene. I was trying to do this mapping manually,"
6827040,6835280," but I think I should try to start using the translation matrices that come with the canvas rendering"
6835280,6842880," context. Right. So, in CTX, there are some methods like scale and transpose or translate or something"
6842880,6847520," like that. Yeah, there we go. So, canvas translate. So, in here, as you can see, you can rotate the whole"
6847520,6852320," thing. And it basically like applies like a matrix transformation. And it just stays like that. And"
6852320,6857440," whatever you draw is going to be automatically transformed according to these transformations and"
6857440,6863920," everything. So, here, as you can see, I'm just taking this strip width. Right. And then I keep"
6863920,6871840," multiplying this entire strip width to like literally everything. If I scaled something like this. So,"
6871840,6882000," let's actually try. If I scaled the whole thing with this value, right, with this value, but didn't scale"
6882000,6890800," the height, I would never need to even have a strip width and like ever multiply everything by strip width."
6890800,6897120," Because that scaling is going to happen automatically for me. Let's actually go through the compilation"
6897120,6902560," errors. So, let me enable the fly check mode that shows the compilation errors. So, and let's go to the"
6902560,6910720," next thing. Yeah. As you can see here, I multiply that. The next one is basically one. Right. So, I don't have to do that."
6910720,6922640," The next one don't need any more multiplication in here. This is going to be one. This is going to be another one. And this is going to be another one."
6922640,6938720," There we go. So, do we have any errors? We don't have any errors. And if I refresh everything. So, everything is broken now. Right. So, I think this is because I have to save and reset this. Yeah. So, here is the interesting thing. So, every time I call to scale, it actually scales it"
6938720,6956720," more and more and more and more. Right. So, we need to save and restore the state of the transformations like we do in a render minimap. Right. So, if you do save, what it does, it just takes all the transformations and saves them onto the stack. And then you can restore them like pop out of the stack."
6956720,6979720," So, let's give it a try. So, let's give it a try. So, I think I can do the save here. This CTX save. All right. And at the end of this entire stuff, we're going to do CTX restore. Right. So, whatever modifications we do to the context, they're going to be restored. All right. So, let's actually refresh this entire thing. And it works."
6979720,7003720," It works. So, here's an interesting thing. I just removed the entire concept of strip width. And I don't have to multiply by strip width and it just works. Right. So, I want to do another thing I want to do is to actually introduce the screen height of some sort. Screen height. And scale it vertically in a similar way."
7003720,7017720," Right. So, here's the width. So, maybe I can do something like, ooh, this one is rather interesting because the ratio of the screen is basically 16 by 9. Yeah, there it goes. So, this is a 16 by 9."
7017720,7029720," And we explicitly set the width of the canvas to be 60 by 9. So, what I'm thinking is that maybe here we could also have 60 by 9 like so and have some sort of like a screen factor."
7029720,7041720," All right. So, I intentionally want the game resolution to be smaller than the size of the canvas to create this sort of like an old school pixelated look. Right."
7041720,7049720," So, you have a size of a canvas itself, but this is not a real resolution of the game. The real resolution of the game is going to be much smaller."
7049720,7056720," So, to create it like in a sort of pixelated way. Right. You know what I'm talking about? You know what I'm talking about? I think you guys know what I'm talking about."
7056720,7066720," Right. So, here, what's going to be the factor? So, I think I could like multiply it maybe by 30. Right. I want it to be actually rather small."
7066720,7070720," Yeah, 30 is going to be fine, I think. 30 is going to be fine."
7070720,7079720," So, and in here, do I maybe need to do math floor in case I actually want to do something super small? Right."
7079720,7084720," So, if I want to do some sort of like a fractional stuff in here, but maybe I'm not going to do fractional stuff like that."
7084720,7096720," Anyways. So, yeah. So, we have this kind of stuff. And in the render scene, I want to now scale the whole thing."
7096720,7103720," Right. Height divided by screen height. This is what I want to do in here. So, I suppose it's going to fuck up."
7103720,7112720," Yeah, it fucked up everything now. And this is because in the implementation of the render scene, we use directly this thing."
7112720,7118720," So, what we have to do, we have to now replace it with the screen height. Right. So, we have to now replace it with the screen height."
7118720,7127720," So, I'm going to replace this thing with the screen height. Right. Like so. And boom. So, there's quite a few places where we do that."
7127720,7134720," So, there's quite a few places where we do that, but hopefully now. Yeah, now it is fine. Right. So, yeah."
7134720,7141720," So, we're mapping everything accordingly and it looks all right. So, if I now make the resolution much smaller. Right."
7141720,7146720," So, what is the if the factor is like 10. So, it's going to be super pixelated, I think."
7146720,7151720," Yeah, it is actually super. It works. It actually works exactly as I would expect it."
7151720,7158720," It is not quantized super well. I wouldn't say that it is quantized super well."
7158720,7168720," So, I think to make it properly quantized we have to do floor and seal on the coordinates and stuff like that."
7168720,7175720," So, in here we have x. So, x and y I think we should do something like floor. So, that's the floor."
7175720,7184720," All right. So, and in here. Math floor. So, this is x and y. Like so. So, this has to be ceiling."
7184720,7190720," Like there's no point in doing seal on one. Right. But I want to do it for the sake of documentation."
7190720,7199720," For sort of like a symmetry. Right. So, that means I seal the sizes and I floor the coordinates. Right."
7199720,7203720," You see what I'm talking about? I seal the sizes and I floor the coordinates."
7203720,7209720," There's no reason to seal one. And there's no reason to seal x because it's actually like quantized by one."
7209720,7218720," But for the sake of documentation. Right. So, to sort of demonstrate the intent. I still want to do that. Right. So, I still want to do that."
7218720,7226720," So, yeah. I already actually floored this thing in here. But this one is actually the source of the drawing."
7226720,7232720," So, the first four arguments in here are the coordinates within the image. Because it's sort of like a sprite."
7232720,7238720," And the second four coordinates are the destination. Right. So, in here we don't really do anything in here."
7238720,7248720," So, this is where we have to do floor. Right. So, this is going to be floor of this thing. And this is going to be the floor of another thing."
7248720,7255720," Right. So, math seal is going to be that. And this one is going to be math seal as well."
7255720,7264720," And we need to repeat this kind of stuff for the rectangle. So, here Emacs just hanged because probably of the LSP or something like that."
7264720,7274720," Right. So, here we're drawing an image which is a strip from the texture. And then on top of it we're rendering a semi-transparent rectangle. Right."
7274720,7286720," So, as you can see we're setting the fill style with like alpha not being equal to one. Actually less than one. And this is how we shade it. So, this is the texture and this is the shading."
7286720,7296720," Right. And the shade, the strip that shades this entire thing is actually has the same size. Right. So, it has the same size, same coordinates and stuff like that."
7296720,7306720," Right. So, maybe because of that, maybe because of that I have to maybe factor out all of these elements. That would actually make sense, believe it or not."
7306720,7315720," But here I'm actually making this strip a little bit bigger. But yeah, let's actually remove extending it so they're the same."
7315720,7323720," So, this is going to be MathFloor, like so. And this one is MathSealThat. MathSealThat."
7323720,7329720," So, yeah, actually computing this coordinate because there's the same for drawImage and the same for the fillRect."
7329720,7342720," And in fact, they're the same for this thing in here. We could just pre-compute this strip, the coordinates of this strip, and then just like use them in all of these places, hopefully."
7342720,7348720," So, do we have any problems in here? I don't think so. Yeah. Now, I feel like it is quantized."
7348720,7356720," Yeah. You can clearly kind of see that all of that shit is quantized. I should have actually done this direct scaling in the canvas yesterday."
7356720,7362720," I think I didn't do that because I was a little bit tired and I was afraid that it's not going to work properly."
7362720,7370720," Yeah. And now everything feels properly quantized with a low resolution and stuff like that. In fact, we can make the resolution even smaller."
7370720,7376720," How about five? All right. So, look at this resolution."
7376720,7383720," We can keep decreasing resolution. It's just like, yeah. It feels increasingly more and more old school."
7383720,7390720," Yeah. Look how jittery it is. The reason why it is jittery like that is because it quantized to the pixel."
7390720,7397720," Okay. So, I achieved exactly what I wanted to achieve. This is actually perfect. So, what if I make it like actually factor one?"
7397720,7403720," So, that means the height of the screen is going to be nine. Holy shit. Okay."
7403720,7418720," That is interesting, actually. Yeah. So, that's a lot. So, that means it should fully disappear when the distance from the object reaches nine or something."
7418720,7427720," Yeah. I think this is... Okay. So, I would say this is roughly nine and the whole scene in here actually disappeared."
7427720,7435720," One, two, three, four, five. Yeah. It's roughly nine. It's also diagonal. So, diagonal you need a little bit less of the things."
7435720,7453720," So, it is roughly nine. So, it works exactly as I would expect it because, right, as already said yesterday, as already said yesterday, the way we compute the strip height, we take the screen height and divide it by the distance from the player to the obstacle."
7453720,7464720," So, that means as soon as the distance from the obstacle to the player reaches the height of the screen, the object completely disappears in the horizon, according to this map."
7464720,7472720," And I was trying to create a setup where I could fucking confirm that, right? So, what if I set the height of the screen to something super small?"
7472720,7479720," Will I be able to see that effect of the object completely disappear when I actually reach this sort of distance? I actually reach that."
7479720,7489720," So, this is not a reasonable resolution, but if I set the reasonable resolution to even 100, it's kind of difficult to achieve because I'll have to wait for too long to actually go to the distance of 100."
7489720,7493720," So, you know what I'm talking about? Right. So, obviously, we're not going to play with this kind of resolution."
7493720,7504720," Right. So, but it's kind of useful to be able to set such a resolution just to test some shit. Right. Just to test the understanding of the map and stuff. Right. And obviously, we're not going to keep it like that."
7504720,7531720," So, let's actually make something like 20. Right. So, let's refresh it. Yeah, there we go. So, something like that is way better, I think. Something like that is way better. Right. And I really like that it is quantized now. In fact, maybe we can get rid of draw image and like draw the pixels ourselves with rectangles and actually sample colors from the textures and stuff like that. I don't know. So, we can actually do quite a lot of things."
7531720,7545720," So, I saw some subs, by the way. I think I saw some subs. I don't know if I acknowledge them. Thank you so much, StrapTalk for tier one subscription. And Murilla Obear, thank you so much for tier one with the message. I'm something of a programmer myself. Nice to hear that."
7545720,7560720," I'm really glad that. I'm really glad that programmers actually watch me. Because, right, I'm one of these rare streamers who actually makes programmer content for programmers. Not wannabe programmers, but for actual programmers who understand what the fuck is going on."
7564720,7583520," So, yeah. So, yeah. You know what I hate? I hate that I kind of get stuck when I'm too close to the wall. I kind of hate that."
7583720,7603720," I kind of hate that. So, maybe, like, I want to make the player to sort of slide along, right? Because it doesn't really feel good. Like, I'm already, I'm pressing forward. I'm pressing forward. And it's just like, I don't know. I don't know what the fuck is going on. So, we probably need to do something in here."
7603720,7618720," So, I have a couple of ideas. What if we… Yeah. So, essentially, we probably need to do the thing where we try different components of the new position, right? So, that's what we have to do."
7618720,7631720," So, instead of the new position and even this entire stuff. So, let's introduce something like maybe nx. Let's take the player position. So, this is the player position x and we add the velocity."
7631720,7647720," Velocity x multiplied by delta time. So, in here we can check, can player go there? So, here is the scene and then new vector nx but the old position, right? So, it's going to be player position y."
7647720,7655720," Right. And if we can go there, we update the player position to be that. So, this is my usual sort of trick."
7655720,7667720," So, and for example, if you can't go in one coordinate, like in x but can go in y, you will go in y, right? So, you will sort of like a slide around. So, you're not going to be stuck anymore, hopefully."
7667720,7673720," So, we're going to have in y. I might as well even copy paste this, I think, because it's kind of like symmetrical code anyway."
7673720,7683720," So, this is y, right? And in here we actually use the x and then ny and we are reassigning the ny like this."
7683720,7690720," So, hopefully that will make it actually slide around. So, let me see. Yeah, finally. So, I'm not stuck anymore."
7690720,7698720," Should've done that like earlier. And I don't even need, I don't even need a circle. Yeah, this feels much better."
7698720,7708720," Holy fuck. Yo, what the fuck. Yeah. I'm just hugging the wall. Just hugging the wall. Look at that. Yeah, just sliding around."
7708720,7718720," Really like that. Really fucking like that, mate. Cool, cool. So, maybe we can do committee, committee."
7718720,7726720," So, yes, yes, yes. So, I think I can actually commit this entire thing separately, right? So, yeah."
7726720,7738720," Make the player slide along the wall, right? Slide along the wall. I'm going to push that right into the repo."
7738720,7746720," So, and the next thing that we're going to do in here is probably, I don't know. So, what we introduce in here."
7746720,7756720," So, we introduce like a screen height, right? Let's put it this way. Introduce hardcoded screen height."
7756720,7763720," So, that's what we introduced in here. We introduced the hardcoded screen height."
7763720,7775720," So, the time has come to try to introduce the floor, right? At least the floor."
7775720,7782720," So, as soon as we manage to make the floor, we'll be able to also make the ceiling because the mat is going to be the same, right?"
7782720,7789720," It's just like you put it upside down and it works fine, hopefully. We'll see. We'll see."
7789720,7795720," So, interestingly, the thing that we're doing here. So, this is called renderScene."
7795720,7802720," But in reality, what we're rendering, we're actually rendering the walls, right? So, this is rendering of the walls."
7802720,7810720," Maybe because of that, maybe because of that, I want to actually rename this entire thing."
7810720,7814720," So, I'm going to do query replace, renderScene, renderWalls, right?"
7814720,7819720," Because I'm going to have a separate function for rendering the floor and rendering the ceiling."
7819720,7823720," Right, there we go. So, I also want to make it separate."
7823720,7828720," RenderScene, renderWalls."
7828720,7832720," There we go. Because you kind of have to render them in a different order, right?"
7832720,7837720," So, first you have to render floor and ceiling and only then you have to render the walls, right?"
7837720,7839720," So, because you're always going to..."
7839720,7845720," The walls are going to be effectively always in front of the floor and ceiling, effectively."
7845720,7846720," Okay."
7846720,7854720," So, let's go ahead and just straight up introduce renderFloor."
7854720,7859720," Let's find renderWalls and nearby we're going to have renderFloor."
7859720,7861720," So, this is a function renderFloor."
7861720,7867720," So, in here we obviously are going to accept the context and the player position, right?"
7867720,7870720," So, because the player position is the camera position as well."
7870720,7874720," But scene is rather interesting thing."
7874720,7881720," Scene is rather interesting thing because scene, it's only walls."
7881720,7883720," Which makes you think."
7883720,7889720," So, should scene also contain floor and ceiling information?"
7889720,7895720," Since we actually recently made scene a class, it's sort of like an abstraction nowadays."
7895720,7897720," It's sort of an abstraction."
7897720,7900720," And what's interesting is that it stores the cells."
7900720,7904720," But in fact, in reality, what it does, it stores the walls."
7904720,7908720," I feel like one thing we need to do in here, we need to rename them to walls, right?"
7908720,7910720," So, this is walls."
7910720,7914720," And in fact, let's actually find everywhere we say cell."
7914720,7916720," Right, so here is a heating cell."
7916720,7918720," Do we even use this shit anywhere?"
7918720,7919720," I think we do."
7919720,7924720," I think we need to make it part of the scene at some point."
7924720,7925720," Right, okay."
7925720,7926720," This is the cell."
7926720,7927720," Where are the others?"
7927720,7929720," So, this thing should be wall, right?"
7929720,7932720," And in here, we just have walls, right?"
7932720,7933720," And this is wall."
7933720,7936720," And now, interestingly, what I can say."
7936720,7938720," I want to introduce a floor."
7938720,7940720," And floor is going to be the texture, right?"
7940720,7944720," So, for now, I'm going to just set a single texture for the entire floor."
7944720,7945720," Right."
7945720,7947720," In the future, we're probably going to have some sort of a map."
7947720,7951720," We're going to say that maybe this style of the floor is going to have one texture."
7951720,7952720," This one is going to have another one."
7952720,7955720," But I don't want to build the data structure for this kind of thing."
7955720,7959720," It's easier for me to just say, okay, so floor is always this texture."
7959720,7960720," Right."
7960720,7962720," So, I think it's going to be easier for me to do it like that."
7962720,7966720," And the texture, obviously, we denote the textures with the HTML image element, right?"
7966720,7971720," So, because that's web, there's nothing much you can do about that."
7971720,7972720," Right."
7972720,7973720," So, here's the floor."
7973720,7975720," And this is HTML image element."
7975720,7979720," And here, we're going to just save the floor like so."
7979720,7980720," So, interesting thing."
7980720,7981720," Okay."
7981720,7984720," So, walls, we need to query replace cells with walls."
7984720,7985720," Boom."
7985720,7986720," We did that."
7986720,7987720," Can you do that?"
7987720,7988720," I don't fucking think so."
7988720,7993720," So, here is, we're checking that the point is within the scene."
7993720,7994720," So, that makes sense."
7994720,7995720," And then here, we get the cell."
7995720,7997720," In fact, we have to get the wall."
7997720,7998720," Right."
7998720,7999720," So, you can get the wall."
7999720,8000720," Right."
8000720,8003720," And you can also quickly check there when something is a wall or not."
8003720,8006720," So, this is walls and this is wall."
8006720,8010720," So, why it was so important for me to actually rename this kind of thing?"
8010720,8017720," Because now, you can probably even get a floor by a coordinate."
8017720,8018720," All right."
8018720,8021720," So, let me actually say, get floor."
8021720,8029720," And you take the coordinate and it should return you maybe HTML or something, something like that."
8029720,8030720," What's interesting is that."
8030720,8031720," Okay."
8031720,8032720," Okay."
8032720,8033720," So, here is the thing."
8033720,8039720," Technically, technically, floor can also be RGBA."
8039720,8043720," It can also be image element or it can be also new."
8043720,8044720," Right."
8044720,8046720," In case, like, there is no floor in there."
8046720,8048720," So, you can fall there or something like that."
8048720,8051720," So, this kind of thing, I don't even know."
8051720,8052720," I don't even know."
8052720,8054720," So, this is not just a wall."
8054720,8056720," This entity can be either wall."
8056720,8057720," It could be either floor."
8057720,8059720," It could be either ceiling."
8059720,8063720," So, because of that, I feel like maybe it should still call be cell."
8063720,8065720," Or maybe we should call it tile."
8065720,8069720," So, I think something like tile is a better name for this kind of thing."
8069720,8070720," Right."
8070720,8071720," So, here is the walls."
8071720,8072720," They are tiles."
8072720,8073720," And here is the floor."
8073720,8074720," It is tile."
8074720,8076720," So, that makes sense to me."
8076720,8077720," I think."
8077720,8078720," I think that makes sense to me."
8078720,8080720," So, floor here is also tile."
8080720,8082720," And you can, as you can see, tile can be null."
8082720,8085720," So, that means it can be missing and stuff like that."
8085720,8086720," So, that's actually pretty cool."
8086720,8087720," So, get wall."
8087720,8094720," You either get a tile and then you can get a floor right at that specific position."
8094720,8097720," And you can also get a tile or you can get undefined."
8097720,8098720," So, yeah."
8098720,8105720," Interestingly, we can say if you are within the scene, you're going to return something."
8105720,8107720," If you're outside of the scene, we're going to return undefined."
8107720,8110720," So, then we floor the whole thing."
8110720,8115720," And funny enough, we don't really need these coordinates."
8115720,8119720," So, we can simply just return this floor for now."
8119720,8123720," Since, like, you can only set one texture for the floor."
8123720,8125720," We're going to always return that texture."
8125720,8126720," Okay."
8126720,8128720," So, this is a little bit of refactoring that I would like to apply."
8128720,8131720," Obviously, the code that was using all the functions is now broken."
8131720,8134720," What we need to do, we need to go through the compilation errors."
8134720,8135720," Right."
8135720,8138720," So, let's go to the compilation errors."
8138720,8140720," Fly, check, next error."
8140720,8141720," Okay."
8141720,8142720," So, get cell."
8142720,8145720," Let's quickly, query replace get cells with get wall."
8145720,8146720," Because that's what it is."
8146720,8147720," Right."
8147720,8148720," So, this is a get wall."
8148720,8149720," All right."
8149720,8150720," So, next compilation error."
8150720,8151720," So, render floor."
8151720,8152720," So, render floor."
8152720,8153720," Okay."
8153720,8154720," So, this is not finished yet."
8154720,8155720," So, let's actually remove that."
8155720,8156720," What's the next thing?"
8156720,8157720," New scene."
8157720,8160720," So, it doesn't like something."
8160720,8161720," Yeah."
8161720,8162720," So, you have to specify the floor."
8162720,8165720," So, what we're going to say is set as a floor."
8165720,8166720," Let's set..."
8166720,8167720," You know what's funny?"
8167720,8172720," Is that I can always just say null."
8172720,8173720," And it will kind of work."
8173720,8176720," So, it tells that by default you don't have a floor."
8176720,8178720," But let's not do that."
8178720,8179720," Let's not do that for now."
8179720,8185720," So, let's take, for example, wall1 and say that this is going to be the floor for now."
8185720,8186720," Right."
8186720,8187720," We're going to change it in the future."
8187720,8188720," But it's going to be for now."
8188720,8189720," And, yeah."
8189720,8191720," We don't have any compilation errors anymore."
8191720,8192720," Right."
8192720,8194720," So, it's really pleasant to work with the TypeScript."
8194720,8195720," Right."
8195720,8197720," So, on top of a shitty language."
8197720,8199720," So, it really helps you to refactor things."
8199720,8200720," I think."
8200720,8202720," It really helps you to refactor things."
8202720,8203720," Okay."
8203720,8206720," So, render floor."
8206720,8207720," Render floor."
8207720,8208720," So, in here."
8208720,8209720," Yeah."
8209720,8210720," We accept the player."
8210720,8211720," And we're going to be also accepting the scene."
8211720,8214720," Because the information about the floor is contained within the scene."
8214720,8217720," So, interestingly."
8217720,8218720," Interestingly."
8218720,8221720," So, as you can see here."
8221720,8223720," When we are rendering the walls."
8223720,8227720," We're iterating from 0 to the width of the screen."
8227720,8230720," We're scanning from left to the right."
8230720,8232720," We're scanning from left to the right."
8232720,8234720," That's what we're doing."
8234720,8236720," In case of rendering the floor."
8236720,8237720," What we'll have to do."
8237720,8241720," We'll have to scan from the bottom to the top."
8241720,8243720," Actually, to the half of the screen."
8243720,8245720," So, that's what we have to do."
8245720,8248720," So, this is the kind of scanning we're going to be doing."
8248720,8249720," This is the kind of scamming."
8249720,8250720," Right?"
8250720,8252720," The scam line."
8252720,8253720," So, it's not just."
8253720,8254720," You know."
8254720,8255720," In case of a fake 3D."
8255720,8257720," It's not called scan line."
8257720,8258720," It's called scam line."
8258720,8262720," Because it's a fake 3D."
8262720,8263720," It's a fake 3D."
8263720,8263720," Right?"
8263720,8264720," You know."
8264720,8265720," Haha."
8265720,8266720," Fun."
8266720,8267720," Sorry."
8267720,8268720," Anyways."
8268720,8269720," Whatever."
8269720,8270720," So, let's implement the scam line."
8270720,8271720," Right."
8271720,8273720," And I suppose."
8273720,8274720," Though, by the way."
8274720,8275720," By the way."
8275720,8277720," I think in case of rendering the floor."
8277720,8278720," And stuff like that."
8278720,8279720," And the walls."
8279720,8281720," We also have to save the translation."
8281720,8282720," The scaling."
8282720,8283720," And everything."
8283720,8284720," Right?"
8284720,8286720," We are rendering within the same resolution."
8286720,8287720," Right?"
8287720,8288720," So, to speak."
8288720,8289720," So, yes."
8289720,8290720," Saving and scaling."
8290720,8291720," Should be done as well."
8291720,8292720," In here."
8292720,8293720," Right?"
8293720,8295720," And here is an interesting thing."
8295720,8296720," So, as you can see."
8296720,8297720," Here is a render game."
8297720,8299720," Here we are rendering fake."
8299720,8300720," Floor."
8300720,8301720," And skybox."
8301720,8303720," Which is just two rectangles."
8303720,8304720," At the top."
8304720,8305720," And the bottom."
8305720,8306720," Right?"
8306720,8307720," And in here."
8307720,8308720," We render the walls."
8308720,8309720," And then we render minimap."
8309720,8311720," So, the order of rendering of these things."
8311720,8312720," Is super important."
8312720,8314720," So, first we have to render the floor."
8314720,8315720," Right?"
8315720,8316720," Then on top of that."
8316720,8317720," We are going to render the walls."
8317720,8318720," And on top of that."
8318720,8319720," We render minimap."
8319720,8320720," Right?"
8320720,8321720," So, as you can see."
8321720,8322720," We are stacking them."
8322720,8323720," On top of each other."
8323720,8324720," So, in here."
8324720,8325720," Obviously."
8325720,8326720," I have to do CTX."
8326720,8327720," Player scene."
8327720,8328720," Right?"
8328720,8329720," So, I am passing all of this information in here."
8329720,8330720," And in the future."
8330720,8331720," By the way."
8331720,8332720," We are also going to have a ceiling."
8332720,8333720," Right?"
8333720,8334720," So, to be fair."
8334720,8335720," Rendering ceiling and floor."
8335720,8336720," Could be done in any order."
8336720,8337720," Right?"
8337720,8338720," Because they don't really overlap with each other."
8338720,8339720," So, it doesn't really matter."
8339720,8340720," But."
8340720,8341720," Floor and ceiling."
8341720,8342720," Should be rendered before walls."
8342720,8343720," Because the walls."
8343720,8344720," Floor and ceiling."
8344720,8345720," Okay."
8345720,8347720," So, what we are going to do in here."
8347720,8348720," So, this is a floor."
8348720,8350720," And what we need to do."
8350720,8354720," We need to start iterating backwards."
8354720,8355720," Sort of speak."
8355720,8359720," So, let me open the maPaint."
8359720,8360720," MaPaint."
8360720,8361720," Right?"
8361720,8362720," Uh-huh."
8362720,8363720," Uh-huh."
8363720,8364720," So, yes."
8364720,8367720," So, here is the scene."
8367720,8370720," Here is the scene."
8370720,8371720," Here is the player."
8371720,8374720," And here is FOV."
8374720,8377720," So, here are the things."
8377720,8380720," And we also have like a near clipping plane."
8380720,8383720," And this is sort of like a projection."
8383720,8386720," So, and the scan line."
8386720,8387720," The scan line."
8387720,8388720," The scan line."
8388720,8389720," Of this thing."
8389720,8394720," Is actually the bottom row of the pixels."
8394720,8398720," So, let's actually imagine something like this."
8398720,8399720," So, on the left."
8399720,8403720," We have the top down view of this scene."
8403720,8405720," So, this is like the purple one."
8405720,8407720," Is the top down view of the scene."
8407720,8408720," The green one."
8408720,8411720," Is the actual view of the scene of the player."
8411720,8413720," The actual projection."
8413720,8415720," So, this line."
8415720,8416720," Right?"
8416720,8417720," This first line."
8417720,8419720," Of the sort of projection thing in here."
8419720,8422720," Is the bottom line in here."
8422720,8425720," This is the bottom line of pixels in here."
8425720,8427720," So, what we need to do."
8427720,8428720," We need to identify this line."
8428720,8430720," And we need to start sampling it."
8430720,8432720," With the same interval."
8432720,8434720," As we have the pixels here in the width."
8434720,8436720," And as we sample these colors."
8436720,8439720," We put these scores at the bottom."
8439720,8441720," Sort of line in here."
8441720,8442720," Right?"
8442720,8443720," So, the next thing we do."
8443720,8444720," Now."
8444720,8446720," We take the next line."
8446720,8448720," Along this sort of like."
8448720,8449720," Arrays."
8449720,8451720," That denote the field of view."
8451720,8452720," Right?"
8452720,8453720," And that next line."
8453720,8455720," Is the second line in here."
8455720,8457720," Is the second line in here."
8457720,8459720," And we continue iterating this thing."
8459720,8460720," I already explained it on the previous stream."
8460720,8461720," Right?"
8461720,8462720," We continue iterating this thing."
8462720,8463720," And as you can see."
8463720,8465720," Like each row in here."
8465720,8466720," Corresponds to the next row in here."
8466720,8468720," And we keep doing that."
8468720,8469720," Until like."
8469720,8471720," Half of the screen."
8471720,8472720," Until half of the screen."
8472720,8474720," So, we're just going through all of these things."
8474720,8475720," And we're placing them."
8475720,8476720," Like this."
8476720,8477720," Right?"
8477720,8478720," So, until we go to."
8478720,8479720," To the middle."
8479720,8480720," So, the question."
8480720,8481720," The real question in here."
8481720,8482720," The real question in here."
8482720,8485720," For how long we fucking go in here."
8485720,8486720," Right?"
8486720,8487720," Like."
8487720,8488720," Where."
8488720,8489720," At which point."
8489720,8490720," In here."
8490720,8491720," We reach."
8491720,8492720," Half of the screen."
8492720,8493720," Right?"
8493720,8494720," At which point."
8494720,8495720," We reach."
8495720,8496720," Half of the screen."
8496720,8497720," So."
8497720,8499720," This will cause distortion."
8499720,8500720," I guess."
8500720,8501720," I don't feel like."
8501720,8502720," It will cause distortion."
8502720,8503720," Because for distortion."
8503720,8504720," We should actually go."
8504720,8505720," Like."
8505720,8506720," Arcs."
8506720,8507720," But even if it will go."
8507720,8507720," Like."
8507720,8508720," Create distortion."
8508720,8509720," Right?"
8509720,8511720," Let's implement the distortion."
8511720,8512720," And then fix it later."
8512720,8513720," This mindset."
8513720,8515720," That I absolutely dislike."
8515720,8516720," Is that."
8516720,8516720," Oh."
8516720,8517720," We should not do that."
8517720,8518720," Because it will cause problems."
8518720,8519720," No, no, no."
8519720,8520720," Let's fucking implement the wrong thing."
8520720,8521720," Okay?"
8521720,8525720," Don't be scared to implement wrong and incorrect thing."
8525720,8528720," Because you will have something wrong and incorrect."
8528720,8529720," But fucking working."
8530720,8531720," And then."
8531720,8532720," You can fix that."
8532720,8534720," Don't talk yourself away."
8534720,8536720," From doing shit."
8536720,8538720," Just because you can accidentally make it wrong."
8538720,8540720," Fucking fix it then later."
8540720,8541720," It's just like."
8541720,8542720," Mmm."
8542720,8544720," The thing that is."
8544720,8545720," Works incorrectly."
8545720,8547720," Is better than the thing that."
8547720,8548720," Doesn't work."
8548720,8549720," Or doesn't exist."
8549720,8550720," Uh."
8550720,8551720," Right."
8551720,8552720," Mmm."
8552720,8553720," Um."
8553720,8558720," But if you implement it wrong."
8558720,8560720," Think my professor will fail me."
8560720,8563720," Go tell your professor to go fuck themselves."
8563720,8564720," Uh."
8564720,8565720," So."
8565720,8568720," And that will get you expelled from the university."
8568720,8570720," And that will make you a better professional."
8570720,8572720," I'm joking."
8572720,8573720," By the way."
8573720,8574720," Don't take it seriously."
8574720,8577720," Right."
8577720,8578720," So."
8578720,8579720," Yeah."
8579720,8585720," But there is a part of truth to what I said."
8585720,8586720," Right."
8586720,8587720," So."
8587720,8588720," Uh."
8588720,8589720," So."
8589720,8590720," Don't."
8590720,8591720," Don't actually do that."
8591720,8592720," I'm."
8592720,8593720," Actually being ironic."
8593720,8594720," But."
8594720,8595720," Ponder upon."
8595720,8596720," Upon the things I've said."
8596720,8598720," Ponder upon the things I've said."
8598720,8599720," So."
8599720,8600720," What I'm trying to say is that."
8600720,8602720," Don't take your professor too seriously."
8602720,8603720," Right."
8603720,8604720," So."
8604720,8605720," They're professor."
8605720,8606720," For a reason."
8606720,8608720," If they're so fucking smart."
8608720,8611720," Why they're not a rock star in the industry."
8611720,8614720," And why they're just a mere professor."
8614720,8617720," theorizing about the things instead of making them."
8617720,8620720," Maybe this is because they kind of failed at."
8620720,8621720," You know."
8621720,8622720," At the industry."
8622720,8624720," And they were kind of forced to go into academia."
8624720,8625720," Like."
8625720,8626720," Think about that."
8626720,8627720," Right."
8627720,8629720," Give it a couple of minutes of thought."
8629720,8632720," And maybe don't really take whatever the fuck they're saying too seriously."
8632720,8634720," Sometimes they do say important things."
8634720,8635720," But."
8635720,8636720," Hmm."
8636720,8637720," Anyways."
8637720,8639720," Don't take it too seriously."
8639720,8640720," So."
8640720,8641720," Hmm."
8641720,8642720," Yeah."
8642720,8643720," Exactly."
8643720,8646720," Modern education is not about intelligence."
8646720,8648720," It's about alignment with the teacher professor."
8648720,8649720," Exactly."
8649720,8650720," Exactly."
8650720,8651720," It's about alignment with the system."
8651720,8652720," So that's why."
8652720,8653720," When you say."
8653720,8654720," To your professor."
8654720,8655720," Go fuck yourself."
8655720,8656720," While being."
8656720,8657720," Actually."
8657720,8658720," Excellent student."
8658720,8659720," In terms of like."
8659720,8660720," Actually finishing the quizzes."
8660720,8661720," And tests."
8661720,8662720," And stuff like that."
8662720,8663720," You will still be expelled."
8663720,8665720," Because it's not about your skills."
8665720,8666720," Or your ability."
8666720,8667720," It's about compliance."
8667720,8668720," Just because you said."
8668720,8669720," Go fuck yourself."
8669720,8670720," You're not compliant with the system."
8670720,8671720," You go fuck yourself."
8671720,8672720," Right."
8672720,8673720," So it's not about like."
8673720,8674720," What you can do."
8674720,8675720," Not about your skills or anything."
8675720,8676720," It's like."
8676720,8677720," Eh."
8677720,8678720," It's like a kind of secondary thing."
8678720,8679720," It's a secondary thing."
8679720,8680720," Uh."
8680720,8681720," So."
8681720,8682720," Anyways."
8682720,8683720," Anyways."
8683720,8684720," We kind of."
8684720,8685720," Stuck with all that."
8685720,8686720," Um."
8686720,8687720," So yeah."
8687720,8688720," We."
8688720,8691720," So for how long we're going there."
8691720,8692720," For how long we're going there."
8692720,8694720," So my hypothesis is."
8694720,8695720," Uh."
8695720,8696720," Basically."
8696720,8697720," Based on this."
8697720,8698720," Uh."
8698720,8699720," Formula."
8699720,8700720," Right."
8700720,8701720," So."
8701720,8702720," The object completely disappears."
8702720,8703720," The object completely disappears."
8703720,8704720," When."
8704720,8705720," Uh."
8705720,8706720," The distance between the object."
8706720,8707720," And the player."
8707720,8708720," Is the height."
8708720,8709720," Of the screen."
8709720,8710720," So."
8710720,8711720," Essentially."
8711720,8712720," Uh."
8712720,8713720," We have to go."
8713720,8715720," Until the height of the screen."
8715720,8716720," Right."
8716720,8717720," So we have to go."
8717720,8718720," Until the height of the screen."
8718720,8719720," So this is h."
8719720,8720720," And this is h."
8720720,8721720," So forgive my."
8721720,8722720," Uh."
8722720,8723720," Writing."
8723720,8724720," Everything."
8724720,8725720," I could use a smoother thing."
8725720,8726720," Uh."
8726720,8727720," Right."
8727720,8728720," So this is more like width."
8728720,8729720," So this is my hypothesis."
8729720,8730720," Um."
8730720,8731720," So what we're going to be doing."
8731720,8732720," We're going to be just like."
8732720,8733720," Uh."
8733720,8734720," Going."
8734720,8735720," Uh."
8735720,8736720," This."
8736720,8737720," We can even."
8737720,8739720," Do a very interesting thing."
8739720,8740720," We can take the distance."
8740720,8742720," From the projection plane."
8742720,8743720," Uh."
8743720,8744720," Add."
8744720,8745720," The height of the screen."
8745720,8747720," We can add the height of the screen."
8747720,8748720," And then."
8748720,8750720," Divide the whole distance."
8750720,8751720," By the."
8751720,8752720," Half of the height of the screen."
8752720,8753720," So basically."
8753720,8754720," Quantize it."
8754720,8755720," According to how it is quantized."
8755720,8756720," On the screen."
8756720,8757720," And now we know."
8757720,8758720," The amount of steps."
8758720,8759720," We have to make it here."
8759720,8760720," So."
8760720,8761720," I kind of like this idea."
8761720,8762720," Honestly."
8762720,8763720," I kind of like this idea."
8763720,8764720," So maybe."
8764720,8765720," It is time."
8765720,8766720," For a little bit of a."
8766720,8767720," Mini mapping."
8767720,8768720," Uh."
8768720,8769720," Right."
8769720,8770720," For a little bit of a."
8770720,8771720," Mini mapping."
8771720,8772720," Because I think."
8772720,8773720," This kind of stuff."
8773720,8774720," Should be visible."
8774720,8775720," On the mini map."
8775720,8776720," The last time."
8776720,8777720," In the first episode."
8777720,8778720," Right."
8778720,8779720," Already."
8779720,8780720," Of the things."
8780720,8781720," So."
8781720,8782720," For more episodes."
8782720,8783720," Go into the description."
8783720,8784720," There is a playlist in there."
8784720,8785720," In the first episode."
8785720,8786720," I actually."
8786720,8788720," Started with the mini map."
8788720,8789720," And it was drawing."
8789720,8790720," All of the necessary."
8790720,8791720," Sort of clues."
8791720,8792720," On the mini map."
8792720,8793720," And that was actually."
8793720,8794720," Extremely useful."
8794720,8795720," So."
8795720,8796720," In here."
8796720,8797720," I'm also."
8797720,8798720," Need to draw clues."
8798720,8799720," So I think."
8799720,8800720," I'm going to start."
8800720,8801720," Doing the stuff."
8801720,8802720," In the mini map."
8802720,8803720," As well."
8803720,8804720," So."
8804720,8805720," The problem."
8805720,8806720," With the mini map."
8806720,8807720," As of right now."
8807720,8808720," The mini map."
8808720,8809720," Is that."
8809720,8810720," I can't see."
8810720,8811720," Field of view."
8811720,8812720," Because it's."
8812720,8813720," Literally."
8813720,8814720," Inside."
8814720,8815720," Of the square."
8815720,8816720," So."
8816720,8817720," If I increase."
8817720,8818720," The near."
8818720,8819720," Clipping plane."
8819720,8820720," If I say."
8820720,8821720," That it's maybe."
8821720,8822720," Like."
8822720,8823720," One."
8823720,8824720," You'll be able."
8824720,8825720," To see."
8825720,8826720," What I'm talking about."
8826720,8827720," Something."
8827720,8828720," Is."
8828720,8829720," Fucked up."
8829720,8830720," I wonder."
8830720,8831720," What exactly."
8831720,8832720," Oof."
8832720,8835720," I can't."
8835720,8836720," Even open."
8836720,8837720," I feel."
8837720,8838720," Like."
8838720,8839720," We went."
8839720,8840720," To infinite."
8840720,8841720," Loop."
8841720,8842720," The fuck."
8842720,8843720," Wait a second."
8843720,8844720," So."
8844720,8845720," Expression."
8845720,8846720," Expect."
8846720,8847720," Okay."
8847720,8847720," So."
8847720,8848720," It's three."
8848720,8849720," Five."
8849720,8850720," Well."
8850720,8850720," Three."
8850720,8851720," Five."
8851720,8852720," Three."
8852720,8853720," Okay."
8853720,8854720," So."
8854720,8855720," Let's."
8855720,8856720," Let's not do anything."
8856720,8857720," In here."
8857720,8858720," Sorry."
8858720,8859720," Okay."
8859720,8860720," Is it."
8860720,8861720," Compilable."
8861720,8862720," Something."
8862720,8863720," Really."
8863720,8864720," Weird."
8864720,8865720," Happened."
8865720,8866720," Uh."
8866720,8867720," I."
8867720,8868720," Can't."
8868720,8868720," Even."

8869720,8869720," This."
8869720,8870720," Entire."
8870720,8870720," Thing."
8870720,8871720," What."
8871720,8872720," The."
8872720,8873720," Fuck."
8873720,8874720," Freaking."
8874720,8875720," Web."
8875720,8876720," Like."
8876720,8877720," Something."
8877720,8878720," Happened."
8878720,8879720," So."
8879720,8880720," Uh."
8880720,8881720," Yeah."
8881720,8881720," It's."
8881720,8882720," Of course."
8882720,8883720," It's not."
8883720,8884720," Just fucking."
8884720,8885720," Uh."
8885720,8886720," Exit the page."
8886720,8887720," Refresh."
8887720,8888720," The cache."
8888720,8889720," And try again."
8889720,8890720," Please."
8890720,8891720," It."
8891720,8892720," It."
8892720,8893720," Went."

8896720,8897720," And it."
8897720,8898720," Just like."
8898720,8899720," Shitted itself."
8899720,8900720," And now."
8900720,8901720," Fucking."
8901720,8902720," I hate."
8902720,8903720," Web."
8903720,8904720," I hate."
8904720,8905720," Web."
8905720,8906720," I hate."
8906720,8907720," Web."
8907720,8908720," I hate."
8908720,8909720," Web."
8909720,8910720," Because."
8910720,8911720," Fuck."
8911720,8912720," You."
8912720,8913720," It is."
8913720,8913720," So."
8913720,8914720," Annoying."
8914720,8915720," Like."
8915720,8916720," I hate."
8916720,8917720," Like."
8917720,8918720," I can't even."
8918720,8919720," Open devtools."
8919720,8920720," To invalidate the cache."
8920720,8921720," Or anything."
8921720,8922720," It's just like."
8922720,8923720," How is that even."
8923720,8924720," Like."
8924720,8925720," A real platform."
8925720,8926720," Serious platform."
8926720,8927720," For anything."
8927720,8927720," Like."
8927720,8928720," How is that even a thing."
8928720,8929720," Just."
8929720,8930720," Like."
8930720,8931720," Can you stop."
8931720,8932720," Control."
8932720,8933720," Click."
8933720,8934720," Okay."
8934720,8935720," Thank you so much."
8935720,8936720," All right."
8936720,8937720," So."
8937720,8938720," That invalidates the cache."
8938720,8939720," So."
8939720,8940720," Something is actually."
8940720,8941720," Like."
8941720,8942720," Much."
8942720,8943720," More."
8943720,8944720," Wrong."
8944720,8945720," Than this."
8945720,8946720," All right."
8946720,8947720," So."
8947720,8948720," Let me."
8948720,8949720," Maybe."
8949720,8950720," Stash."
8950720,8951720," Everything in here."
8951720,8952720," And."
8952720,8961720," All right."
8961720,8962720," Thank you very much."
8962720,8963720," Web."
8963720,8964720," So."
8964720,8965720," Let's make a small break."
8965720,8966720," Because I'm."
8966720,8967720," I need to break."
8967720,8968720," To deal with this bullshit."
8968720,8969720," Like."
8969720,8970720," It's so dumb."
8970720,8971720," Anyways."
8971720,8972720," Let's make some work."
8972720,8973720," So."
8973720,8974720," Okay."
8974720,8975720," I'm back."
8975720,8976720," We invalidated the caches."
8976720,8977720," I'm not fucking."
8977720,8978720," Closing dev tools."
8978720,8979720," Right."
8979720,8980720," So."
8980720,8981720," Because if I close the dev tools."
8981720,8982720," The invalidation of the cache."
8982720,8983720," Is going to go away."
8983720,8984720," Right."
8984720,8985720," I wonder if we can."
8985720,8986720," Maybe."
8986720,8987720," Press ctrl c."
8987720,8988720," Or maybe."
8988720,8989720," Yeah."
8989720,8991720," I want to be able to see the entirety of the."
8991720,8992720," Of the minimap."
8992720,8993720," So."
8993720,8994720," Yeah."
8994720,8995720," So here's the thing."
8995720,8996720," I can't see."
8996720,8997720," The."
8997720,8998720," FoV."
8998720,8999720," Of the player."
8999720,9002720," Because it's completely inside of the boundaries."
9002720,9003720," Of this entire thing."
9003720,9004720," Um."
9004720,9005720," What I want to do."
9005720,9006720," In."
9006720,9007720," Render minimap."
9007720,9008720," In a render minimap."
9008720,9009720," In a render minimap."
9009720,9010720," I want to actually."
9010720,9012720," Stroke rectangle."
9012720,9013720," Instead of filling it."
9013720,9014720," I wonder if I can do that."
9014720,9015720," So."
9015720,9016720," Here's the fill style."
9016720,9017720," Uh."
9017720,9018720," Yeah."
9018720,9019720," So I can try to stroke the rectangle."
9019720,9020720," So."
9020720,9021720," This is a."
9021720,9022720," Um."
9022720,9023720," Fill style."
9023720,9024720," Uh."
9024720,9025720," And this is a stroke style."
9025720,9026720," Right."
9026720,9027720," So this is going to be stroke style."
9027720,9028720," And let's just."
9028720,9029720," Uh."
9029720,9030720," Stroke the rectangle."
9030720,9031720," Right."
9031720,9032720," So let's just stroke the rectangle."
9032720,9033720," And let me."
9033720,9034720," Let me see now."
9034720,9035720," Are you."
9035720,9036720," Are you happy now?"
9036720,9037720," I can't see."
9037720,9038720," Scheisse."
9038720,9039720," So this is not."
9039720,9041720," How we want to."
9041720,9042720," Do all of that."
9042720,9043720," So I have a feeling."
9043720,9044720," That."
9044720,9045720," What we need to do."
9045720,9046720," So if."
9046720,9047720," Since we're stroking."
9047720,9048720," I need to."
9048720,9049720," Begin the path."
9049720,9050720," Right."
9050720,9051720," So it's going to be CTX."
9051720,9052720," Begin path."
9052720,9053720," Right."
9053720,9054720," Then CTX."
9054720,9055720," Stroke."
9055720,9056720," It's kind of funny that for."
9056720,9057720," Fill erect."
9057720,9059720," I never really have to do that."
9059720,9061720," But for this kind of thing."
9061720,9062720," No."
9062720,9063720," It feels."
9063720,9064720," It feels it completely."
9064720,9065720," So am I."
9065720,9066720," Am I doing something incorrectly?"
9066720,9067720," Um."
9067720,9068720," Okay."
9068720,9069720," Wait a second."
9069720,9070720," What if I."
9070720,9071720," Comment out."
9071720,9072720," This entire thing."
9072720,9073720," Uh."
9073720,9074720," What if I comment out."
9074720,9075720," This entire thing."
9075720,9076720," What the."
9076720,9077720," Is going on."
9077720,9078720," Is it cached again."
9078720,9079720," So disable cache."
9079720,9080720," Okay."
9080720,9080720," Why."
9080720,9081720," You're not."
9081720,9082720," So this is a rendering of the mini map."
9082720,9083720," This is where we render the player."
9083720,9084720," Player position and stuff like that."
9084720,9085720," What is going on."
9085720,9086720," Am I."
9086720,9087720," Going crazy."
9087720,9088720," Again."
9088720,9089720," If I change the color."
9089720,9091720," Am I modifying the wrong piece of code."
9091720,9092720," Am I modifying the wrong piece of code."
9092720,9093720," Am I modifying the wrong piece of code."
9093720,9094720," Am I modifying the wrong piece of code."
9094720,9095720," I feel like I'm modifying the wrong piece of code."
9095720,9095720," I feel like I'm modifying the wrong piece of code."
9095720,9096720," I'm not sure what the fuck is going on."
9096720,9097720," Uh."
9097720,9098720," Right."
9098720,9099720," So render mini map."
9099720,9100720," And stuff like that."
9100720,9101720," And stuff like that."
9101720,9102720," What is going on."
9102720,9103720," Am I going crazy again."
9103720,9104720," If I change the color."
9104720,9105720," To red."
9105720,9106720," Am I modifying the wrong piece of code."
9106720,9107720," Am I modifying the wrong piece of code."
9107720,9108720," Am I modifying the wrong piece of code."
9108720,9109720," Am I modifying the wrong piece of code."
9109720,9111720," Am I modifying the wrong piece of code."
9111720,9112720," Am I modifying the wrong piece of code."
9112720,9113720," Am I modifying the wrong piece of code."
9113720,9114720," I feel like I'm modifying the wrong piece of code."
9114720,9115720," I feel like I'm modifying the wrong piece of code."
9115720,9116720," I'm not sure what the fuck is going on."
9116720,9117720," Uh."
9117720,9118720," Right."
9118720,9119720," So render mini map."
9119720,9120720," Let's find the render mini map."
9120720,9121720," Okay."
9121720,9122720," What if I don't render the mini map."
9122720,9123720," Okay."
9123720,9124720," So it's using the wrong version."
9124720,9125720," It's like."
9125720,9126720," I'm."
9126720,9127720," I disable the cache."
9127720,9128720," Disable the cache."
9128720,9129720," I'm pressing control F5."
9129720,9131720," To refresh the whole thing."
9131720,9132720," Is TSC running."
9132720,9133720," TSC is running."
9133720,9134720," Okay."
9134720,9135720," I'm."
9135720,9136720," I disable the cache."
9136720,9137720," Disable the cache."
9137720,9138720," I'm pressing control F5."
9138720,9139720," To refresh the whole thing."
9139720,9140720," Is TSC running."
9140720,9141720," TSC is running."
9141720,9142720," I'm pressing control F5."
9142720,9143720," To refresh the whole thing."
9143720,9144720," Is TSC running."
9144720,9145720," TSC is running."
9145720,9146720," Okay."
9146720,9147720," Maybe."
9147720,9148720," Something."
9148720,9149720," Got invalidated."
9149720,9150720," Or something."
9150720,9151720," All right."
9151720,9152720," Control shift R in the browser."
9152720,9153720," Okay."
9153720,9154720," So."
9154720,9155720," Okay."
9155720,9156720," But control F5."
9156720,9157720," Used to work."
9157720,9158720," Actually."
9158720,9159720," Control F5."
9159720,9160720," Used to work."
9160720,9160720," Control F5."
9160720,9161720," Used to work."
9161720,9161720," Actually."
9161720,9162720," Control F5."
9162720,9163720," Used to work."
9163720,9164720," Oh."
9164720,9164720," Okay."
9164720,9165720," So."
9165720,9166720," Okay."
9166720,9167720," So."
9167720,9168720," Okay."
9168720,9169720," So."
9169720,9170720," Okay."
9170720,9171720," But control F5."
9171720,9172720," Used to work."
9172720,9173720," Actually."
9173720,9174720," Control F5."
9174720,9175720," Control F5."
9175720,9176720," Used to work."
9176720,9177720," I swear to god."
9177720,9178720," Like."
9178720,9179720," Cache is disabled."
9179720,9180720," Bruh."
9180720,9181720," Okay."
9181720,9182720," Anyways."
9182720,9183720," So."
9183720,9184720," Render Minimap."
9184720,9185720," So."
9185720,9197720," I'm trying to do a very basic fucking thing."
9197720,9200720," And it's almost fucking impossible to do that."
9200720,9201720," It's just like."
9201720,9205720," This is what I was trying to do the whole fucking time."
9205720,9207720," And it's almost impossible to get it."
9207720,9208720," Right."
9208720,9209720," So."
9209720,9210720," Essentially."
9210720,9211720," Yeah."
9211720,9212720," The key."
9212720,9214720," Which is entirely within the."
9214720,9215720," The boundary of the player."
9215720,9216720," Right."
9216720,9217720," So."
9217720,9218720," That's what I was trying to do."
9218720,9219720," So."
9219720,9222720," I feel like it was a combination of the cache of the browser."
9222720,9223720," And."
9223720,9224720," Maybe."
9224720,9225720," TSC."
9225720,9226720," Watch mod failing."
9226720,9227720," Or something like that."
9227720,9228720," It was a combination of these things."
9228720,9229720," Or maybe."
9229720,9230720," By the way."
9230720,9231720," HTTP server."
9231720,9232720," But here's an interesting thing."
9232720,9233720," So."
9233720,9234720," Um."
9234720,9235720," Oh."
9235720,9237720," I didn't disable it."
9237720,9238720," Okay."
9238720,9239720," Wait a second."
9239720,9240720," So."
9240720,9241720," I think we need to do something in here."
9241720,9242720," Node."
9242720,9243720," Bin."
9243720,9244720," HTTP server."
9244720,9245720," So."
9245720,9247720," I think it's a help."
9247720,9251720," I remember experimenting with this shit."
9251720,9252720," And I kind of."
9252720,9253720," Like."
9253720,9254720," Have a false memory of disabling the cache."
9254720,9255720," But then I didn't disable it."
9255720,9256720," Okay."
9256720,9257720," So."
9257720,9258720," Let's actually add."
9258720,9259720," To."
9259720,9260720," HTTPS server."
9260720,9261720," Right."
9261720,9262720," So."
9262720,9263720," Yeah."
9263720,9264720," Just in case."
9264720,9265720," I'm also going to disable the cache."
9265720,9266720," For HTTP server."
9266720,9267720," I think it's a."
9267720,9268720," It's a good thing to do."
9268720,9269720," Just in case."
9269720,9270720," Because you never fucking know."
9270720,9271720," All right."
9271720,9272720," All right."
9272720,9273720," All right."
9273720,9274720," So that's pretty cool."
9274720,9275720," Okay."
9275720,9276720," So."
9276720,9277720," Are you."
9277720,9278720," Are you."
9278720,9279720," You're good."
9279720,9280720," You're good."
9280720,9281720," You're good."
9281720,9282720," You're good."
9282720,9283720," All right."
9283720,9284720," So."
9284720,9285720," And now."
9285720,9286720," I want to go to here."
9286720,9287720," And."
9287720,9294720," This is going to be magenta."
9294720,9295720," Could you please."
9295720,9296720," Okay."
9296720,9297720," So."
9297720,9298720," That's."
9298720,9299720," That's working."
9299720,9300720," So."
9300720,9301720," This is magenta."
9301720,9302720," Right."
9302720,9303720," Mana magenta."
9303720,9304720," Mana magenta."
9304720,9306720," What I need to do."
9306720,9307720," I need to."
9307720,9308720," Now."
9308720,9310720," Maybe even increase the size."
9310720,9311720," Of the."
9311720,9312720," Minimap."
9312720,9313720," I think."
9313720,9314720," This is a good idea."
9314720,9314720," So."
9314720,9315720," We have a cell size."
9315720,9316720," What if I make."
9316720,9317720," This thing."
9317720,9318720," Like."
9318720,9319720," One."
9319720,9320720," Ten percent."
9320720,9321720," Of the whole thing."
9321720,9322720," So."
9322720,9323720," Yeah."
9323720,9324720," There we go."
9324720,9325720," To be fair."
9325720,9326720," Maybe."
9326720,9327720," It's kind of."
9327720,9328720," I'm doing a kind of a dangerous thing."
9328720,9329720," Because I."
9329720,9330720," Close dev tools."
9330720,9331720," But."
9331720,9331720," Since."
9331720,9332720," I can kind of guarantee."
9332720,9333720," That the cache is invalidated."
9333720,9334720," By."
9334720,9334720," Control."
9334720,9335720," Shift."
9335720,9335720," R."
9335720,9336720," Maybe."
9336720,9337720," It's totally fine."
9337720,9338720," So."
9338720,9339720," Yeah."
9339720,9340720," I want to have."
9340720,9341720," Like a bigger."
9341720,9342720," Minimap."
9342720,9343720," I want to have a bigger."
9343720,9344720," Minimap."
9344720,9345720," There we go."
9345720,9346720," So here's the bigger."
9346720,9347720," Minimap."
9347720,9348720," Because I want to be able to see things."
9348720,9349720," So now."
9349720,9350720," What I want to do."
9350720,9351720," I want to draw."
9351720,9352720," A line."
9352720,9353720," From the."
9353720,9354720," Position of the player."
9354720,9355720," To."
9355720,9356720," The."
9356720,9358720," To the far distance."
9358720,9359720," Right."
9359720,9360720," To the."
9360720,9361720," The most."
9361720,9362720," Farthest distance."
9362720,9363720," We can see."
9363720,9364720," Sort of speak."
9364720,9365720," So."
9365720,9366720," Render."
9366720,9367720," Minimap."
9367720,9368720," Let's go."
9368720,9369720," To here."
9369720,9370720," So."
9370720,9371720," This is just."
9371720,9372720," F.O.V."
9372720,9373720," But it's actually."
9373720,9374720," Very."
9374720,9375720," Super small."
9375720,9376720," We have a line."
9376720,9377720," Width."
9377720,9378720," To be fair."
9378720,9378720," Line."
9378720,9379720," Width."
9379720,9380720," Is."
9380720,9381720," A little bit."
9381720,9382720," Too thick."
9382720,9383720," For my liking."
9383720,9384720," Right."
9384720,9385720," So."
9385720,9386720," It's going to be less."
9386720,9387720," Yeah."
9387720,9388720," So now."
9388720,9389720," It is less."
9389720,9390720," Thick."
9390720,9391720," And we can see."
9391720,9392720," F.O.V."
9392720,9393720," Like a little bit."
9393720,9394720," Better."
9394720,9395720," Right."
9395720,9396720," So."
9396720,9396720," Now."
9396720,9397720," I have a line."
9397720,9398720," But I actually."
9398720,9399720," Kind of."
9399720,9399720," Have to."
9399720,9400720," Stroke."
9400720,9401720," A line."
9401720,9402720," From."
9402720,9403720," Um."
9403720,9404720," The."
9404720,9405720," Distance."
9405720,9406720," From."
9406720,9407720," The."
9407720,9407720," Far."
9407720,9408720," Clipping."
9408720,9409720," Plane."
9409720,9410720," Right."
9410720,9411720," So."
9411720,9412720," I need to."
9412720,9413720," Find."
9413720,9414720," This."
9414720,9415720," Point."
9415720,9416720," Is."
9416720,9417720," To."
9417720,9418720," To."
9418720,9418720," To."
9418720,9419720," To."
9419720,9420720," Find."
9420720,9427360," can find this point but it's inside of fov range so it's this one so you take the position uh you"
9427360,9432720," take the direction you scale it to yeah so this is basically the point so let's actually grab it"
9432720,9438640," so that's the point where we kind of start uh right so and this is not really this this is more"
9438640,9443600," like a player right so you take a player position you take the player direction you take it as an"
9443600,9449440," angle you scale it by the near clipping plane and you add it to the player's position right so you"
9449440,9459440," add it to the player position um what's interesting is that um so you found this p and funnily enough"
9459440,9469280," now so this is going to be sort of like your p1 um and you need to find a p2 so let's call it just p1"
9469280,9478080," uh p1 and p2 is going to be kind of like a similar thing it's just like from p1 you add"
9478160,9487840," the direction angle scaled by the screen height right and depending on the screen height it's just"
9487840,9494960," gonna you're gonna see further or uh nearer um so here we can even take this entire thing and sort of"
9494960,9506560," factor it out into the deer like so so now we have a deer and in here we can even draw p1 p2 so we should be"
9506560,9513200," now able to see all of that hopefully yeah that's that's what i'm talking about by the way that's what"
9513200,9523440," i'm talking about and it's actually kind of oof that is not true by the way so what's the what's the height"
9523440,9534560," height is actually kind of kind of big hmm but here is the thing here's the thing we don't have to render the"
9534560,9543600," floor up until the horizon completely because we have a far clipping plane anyway so essentially we're"
9543600,9552560," going to assume that the horizon the center of the screen is basically the height of the screen but we"
9552560,9560000," never have to actually go that far right because if the um if we're going to be inside in enclosed space"
9560000,9565760," that space is probably not going to be that huge right so you're probably never going to see the"
9565760,9573280," entire horizon i think that kind of makes sense right so um so because of that i need to use a far"
9573280,9582080," clipping plane um so and in here a far clipping plane there are basically done like so right so this is gonna be"
9582960,9586960," something like this so this is a far clipping plane uh yep"
9586960,9597840," so let's refresh this entire stuff so yeah there we go now we can see that so as you can see it's"
9597840,9603600," it's kind of funny how it's just like uh wonders around but this is like uh yeah so this is where we"
9603600,9609280," have a far clipping plane uh this is where we have a far clipping plane to be fair for for this kind of"
9609280,9615360," thing i would like to have a slightly different color maybe something like yellowish uh all right"
9615360,9620800," something something yellowish so let's let's give it a try uh yeah so i want to be able to see this kind"
9620800,9628800," of so this is yellowish uh and yeah so we're going to be just drawing it according to that uh now um i"
9628800,9640080," probably want to maybe even have um the right extend the fov right so that's what i want to do i want to"
9640080,9646640," kind of extend the fov so we can see uh in its entirety so i wonder how we're going to do all of"
9646640,9655360," that uh so we're probably going to be doing it in a similar way as we find like p1 and p2"
9655360,9664080," so i don't like the name of p1 and p2 so this is basically near right this is the near point of the"
9664080,9672640," whole thing and this is the far point of the whole thing right so that's what we have uh and in the fov"
9672640,9683040," range fov range what we're doing is that we take this uh point right and we yeah we actually have rot"
9683040,9692320," 90. okay so i even implemented like a rot 90 to to do all of that stuff uh-huh so we take a tangent"
9692320,9699200," yeah yeah i do remember this formula right we take a full v uh right we take half of that so near"
9699200,9705200," clipping plane and so on so forth but but in this specific case we'll have to use a far clipping plane"
9705200,9714720," oh this one is actually rather interesting we can uh basically parameterize that with a clipping plane"
9714720,9720800," who said we can't do that right so uh clipping plane because it's going to be actually reusable now"
9720800,9727840," for what we're trying to do now uh right so this is going to be something like this uh clipping plane"
9727840,9734800," there we go and uh now let's go through the compilation errors and stuff uh fly check next error"
9734800,9741360," so this is a near clipping plane right so that's pretty cool uh and now instead of doing this kind of stuff i"
9741360,9752080," i can do const p1 p2 player fov range far clipping plane right so now it is completely abstracted away"
9752080,9759440," from from here so which is super nice so now we are stroking from p1 to p2 in fact we can just do this"
9759440,9769520," entire thing in here right so uh we can even do it like that so this is a near one uh right so this is the near one"
9769520,9774880," one and we have a far one uh so this is not the entirety of the errors i'm pretty sure so we have"
9774880,9780960," to yeah so now here we have to have a near clipping plane uh when we're rendering the walls and everything"
9780960,9786240," uh and what's the next one so this is not really an error right it's just a warning because we don't"
9786240,9791680," use all the things okay so everything is fine in here and if i try to do that yeah now we can see"
9791680,9797920," look at that so this is sort of like the real fov that we're going to be probably using for rendering"
9797920,9806080," the uh for rendering the floors and everything so this is like a real one this is the real shit"
9806080,9809040," this is real shit"
9813280,9822400," so that's pretty cool what's interesting is that uh when i uh render minimap uh so here is this sort"
9822400,9830640," of like a wings of fov uh this is the near one and this is the far one so we can actually maybe name"
9830640,9839760," the near near near near like so near near and this one is near as well and this one is going to be far"
9839760,9847200," far far far uh maybe i'm going to just do something like this far one"
9847200,9853760," far two i want to factor them out like this"
9856000,9862320," i want to have them both right i want to have them both the reason why i want to have them both"
9862320,9873920," is because um i know uh that i need to iterate linearly from near one to far one"
9873920,9880240," that's what i need to do i need to linearly iterate from near one to far one"
9882560,9885760," so which is rather interesting so"
9885760,9900400," to be fair i don't even need to do it like that i don't even need to do it like that because what i"
9900400,9900800," can do"
9900800,9906960," is i can do that in a loop who said i can't do that in a loop"
9908880,9920240," essentially i can say okay so we're iterating starting from um plane near clipping plane so and"
9920240,9931280," then plane is less than near clipping plane plus 10 or something plus 10 or something so maybe plus plus"
9932080,9941680," plus plus plane uh plus plus plane uh plus plus plane and uh so in here what we can do now we can just do"
9941680,9951760," something like this so we just do uh plane and here i can even rename far to p all right so do we want"
9951760,9959200," to use yellow i'm not sure but let's use yellow we'll see how it goes um all right so now if i clear"
9959200,9967120," replace the center i think okay so it actually goes like 10 which is not entirely what i want"
9967120,9972880," right so it is going too far it is going too far"
9974560,9981600," um so um so what i need to do i need to figure out"
9981600,9989200," yeah so if the entirety of the screen"
9989200,9997600," right if the maximum height you can have is this screen height and this is the maximum width you can"
9997600,10009680," have you can try to figure out how many sort of pixels per uh per distance you have"
10009680,10014240," um"
10014240,10026560," it's too hot it's too hot my brain does not work my brain does not work we need to remap screen oh my god i'm"
10026560,10027280," i can't fucking dying"
10027280,10035440," i'm fucking dying okay i can't think i can't fucking think because of this stupid fucking"
10035440,10037840," heat oh my god it's just so bad"
10037840,10047360," um all right uh i'm trying to focus i i can't think like it's just like like i know what i need"
10047360,10053360," to do but i can't understand in which order i have to divide things because my brain is like jammed"
10053360,10066720," because of the heat um so yeah just a second i need to grab some more cold water just a second"
10072480,10079440," all right okay so i've got some water"
10079440,10092880," now what i'm trying to think is that this doesn't look so that means um in here"
10094720,10101600," um what what kind of steps we have to take in here what kind of steps we have to take in here"
10101600,10105440," so if this height is"
10107440,10112720," so this is is this really like the height of the whole thing"
10112720,10118160," so what's the actual height"
10118160,10126880," screen height and if i increase the height does it affect anything i don't think so because"
10128160,10140880," we're not taking into account that"
10140880,10152080," so if the screen height"
10152080,10157600," if the screen height render minimap"
10161840,10168320," if the screen height is the same as the maximum you basically the um"
10168320,10174960," the distance in there you can take half of the"
10174960,10185280," okay i see this one is really interesting this one is really interesting because uh you need to take"
10187120,10189920," half of the height and you need to divide it by"
10189920,10196800," screen height which gives you the step with which you have to go which effectively means you have"
10196800,10206160," to actually go not plus one but uh half you have to step in half for it to be a proper thing"
10206160,10213200," which makes way more sense i think yeah so finally it makes way more sense so that explains it"
10214000,10220480," uh very very nicely i think i think that explains it very very nicely um so"
10220480,10229760," yeah and after that you sample each individual thing in here accordingly so now what you can do"
10229760,10241040," is you can iterate uh something like dx right so this is dx from zero to screen uh width right from zero to"
10241040,10249840," screen width uh and this is just plus dx uh and this is plus one actually it has to be plus one uh like so"
10249840,10259440," so but the way we're going to be doing that we need to lerp from p1 to p2 uh and so this is dx"
10259440,10264320," um yeah it's going to be less in here so that's that's very important to remember"
10265200,10271440," um and the way we do that is that we take dx divided by screen width and this is how we're going"
10271440,10280240," to be inter it's interpolating so p1 lerp to p2 with this interpolator okay so water helped by the way"
10280240,10284720," okay my brain starts to actually work a little bit better like what the fuck"
10284720,10291200," okay so water like cold water helped so i just have a like a jug of water in my fridge"
10291760,10297920," uh just for this kind of situations okay so this is really cool uh fill circle uh all right all right"
10297920,10307200," uh so now we provide so we want to render this kind of position in here uh so i'm basically rendering"
10307200,10312640," sort of like a samples as we sample all these things um okay so let's give it a try i'm gonna do"
10312640,10320160," something like this and oof what the this is a huge okay so that's that's a lot of samples in here so"
10320160,10328560," we'll probably need to reduce this size let's actually make this thing like fine yeah so there's"
10328560,10333920," a little bit of a problem here because we can't really represent all of the samples in here uh and"
10333920,10342720," we'll probably need to make them very very small uh very very small i don't see where is the render"
10342720,10353440," mini map yeah let's go uh like something like this and i also want to do ctx style feel let's actually"
10353440,10358160," make them sort of like red we don't really have to render the samples i just want to be able to see them"
10358640,10363440," uh i just want to be able to see them nothing nothing particular special so they're too small"
10363440,10371600," now what about making them a little bit bigger feel style feel style let's go feel left"
10371600,10381360," okay there we go that's what i'm doing so i just reduce the resolution and this is basically uh the"
10381360,10388080," samples of the textures that we have to do to render the whole thing right so we're going to be like"
10388080,10393600," iterating through each individual sample in here and we're going to be looking at the position of"
10393600,10400240," this point within the cell right within the cell and we're going to sample the pixel out of this thing"
10400240,10404880," you see what i'm doing here right you see what i'm doing so that's what we're going to be doing"
10404880,10416080," um yeah and we're going to be drawing a rectangle in uh in this sort of like position right so this is"
10416080,10420880," what i'm trying to render in here and as you can see here's an interesting thing this is the same"
10420880,10426240," amount of samples but the closer they are the more like dense they are and as they go further further"
10426240,10431520," away the more sparse they become and this is what we're uh basically how we will achieve probably"
10431520,10445680," the perspective uh hopefully um um hopefully hopefully um interesting why are we doing it performance"
10445680,10448320," huh"
10448320,10453840," what we are trying to implement the floor"
10457360,10464880," what what perform what has performance to do with a feature we're implementing a feature right it's"
10464880,10470320," such a really weird like because we want to have a floor that's what we're doing that we're not"
10470320,10475440," talking about performance uh how can you have performance yeah exactly like i don't understand"
10475440,10479520," the question i'm sorry like i don't want to be asked i'm going to just ignore it um okay"
10482320,10489440," um we're not even talking about performance right it's like why are you implementing operating system"
10489440,10494160," for performance i'm implementing operating system what are you talking about"
10495120,10501520," um thank you so much solar altman uh for tier one subscription thank you thank you thank you and also"
10501520,10509680," so many subs recently did i miss all of them um so k rush thank you so much no good nick uh"
10509680,10512720," uh core uh corey bear thank you thank you thank you thank you"
10512720,10522560," so all right all right um we need to we need to actually start implementing this algorithm here"
10523600,10530560," uh should these lines actually be arc uh we can make them arcs but that will i feel like this will"
10530560,10538640," create a fish eye effect um so i feel like it will create a fish eye effect uh one of the ways we"
10538640,10547680," got rid of the fish eye effect in the scene in here is by essentially uh turning all of that into the"
10547680,10553120," lines into the straight lines anyways whatever uh let's go ahead and"
10553600,10561360," just put that into the render floor uh let's put that into the render floor because this is what"
10561360,10567920," we want to do so render floor we're going to do it like that so here's the render floor uh-huh and in"
10567920,10575120," here all right so we are starting essentially at the near clipping and this is only like 10 by the way"
10575680,10582080," this is only like 10. uh far clipping plane is actually bigger than that"
10582080,10589520," oh far clipping plane is straight up like 10. all right that's very interesting"
10589520,10592880," um right so the far clipping plane"
10597440,10604240," i didn't realize that the far clipping plane is actually way closer than than i thought maybe let's go"
10604240,10609840," back to this entire thing uh render mini map"
10611440,10617920," uh-huh so let's put this stuff in here because i want to kind of see what if we just use a you know"
10617920,10627600," this kind of thing is it going to make it better like closer yeah it's actually it's actually pretty"
10627600,10635520," much the same honestly it's actually pretty much the same we can even repeat uh this sort of thing for"
10635520,10643360," when it's equal right we can even repeat it for when it's equal um so but it doesn't really matter okay"
10643360,10652880," um so now i'm going to go to the render floor i'm going to render floor and we're just iterating"
10652880,10659520," starting from the near clipping plane to the far clipping plane so we get the wings of this whole thing"
10659520,10663760," we don't need to render them per se so we're iterating this entire stuff"
10664960,10676000," and uh so this is a feel and everything so we need to get the floor at that specific position"
10676000,10684560," um this one is rather interesting so this is the position i'm talking about right so this is the p"
10684560,10694640," so this is going to be const p and i take this scene and i get the floor at p i get the floor"
10694640,10702560," at p so and i get either the tile or something else or whatever so if uh we need to do this kind of"
10702560,10714640," thing so maybe i'm gonna take floor like so and for now if floor is instance of html"
10715760,10734560," uh image element blah blah blah blah blah so i need to keep track of the row uh of the thing"
10738400,10746080," so this is the p so this has to be something like can i have several of these things in here like uh"
10746080,10755840," y probably not and it doesn't really matter that much so i can probably say um near clipping plane and"
10755840,10767520," also i can have something like y um so here i actually call this thing dx i'm not sure how good of an idea this is so it's actually called just x"
10767520,10775440," x so this is just x and y we're just gonna have it like that so um what i'm thinking in here"
10775440,10785920," so this is a plane uh it's less than that thing um and what we're constantly doing we're actually incrementing y"
10785920,10797680," uh but what we need to do is more like screen height but minus one and we're going to be constantly"
10797680,10804240," decreasing to this entire thing so that's what we're effectively doing so we have uh now we have x and y and"
10804240,10811520," everything we have x and y um interestingly interestingly interestingly now we need to"
10811520,10817840," map so and this x and y is exactly x and y on the screen which is perfect right so which is exactly what"
10817840,10826640," i want probably um so now what we need to do we need to do uh ctx draw image right so this is a ctx draw image"
10826640,10834560," and in here i have to just supply floor right so my supply and floor and everything so here i should have"
10834560,10842480," the the the screen um what i have in here"
10842480,10855440," p i need to take fractional parts of the components of this thing i need to take fractional parts how can i do"
10855440,10864880," that do i have math frack uh probably not so what i probably have to do"
10864880,10872800," what i probably have to do is um maybe map this entire thing so this is going to be x and in here"
10872800,10880000," i can essentially just take x and subtract the floor of x and that's how i'm going to get the"
10880000,10885120," fraction part of the whole thing so which is going to be super useful um so"
10885120,10891120," we get the floor so right now floor doesn't really matter but in the future it will so i want this"
10891120,10896080," entire thing to be uh you know comfortable to work with so we're going to say this is the texture"
10896080,10904880," coordinates uh which is just p uh and forward like this um and now so what's going to be the source in"
10904880,10914800," here the source in here is going to be t x multiplied by floor width right so it's multiplied by four"
10914800,10920000," width and we have to do math floor of this entire stuff so we're taking a single pixel by the way"
10920000,10931360," right so then math floor uh t y floor height all right so this is x and y and width and height is"
10931360,10935360," going to be one we're taking one pixel of this entire thing and this is the source right so because"
10935360,10940080," the first thing in the draw image is a source and then the destination in terms of this destination"
10940080,10948960," which is the destination uh it's x and y literally one one yeah that that's basically what it is i think"
10948960,10952720," so we have to put a comment here um yeah that's about it"
10952720,10961360," it's gonna be interesting uh it's gonna be interesting to try so it's not going to be right to uh until the"
10961360,10966560," horizon i think it's not going to be right until the horizon uh but we don't really need that anyway"
10966560,10974480," so and by the way we can even use this distance to color things accordingly right so we can use that"
10974480,10982160," to color things accordingly uh do i have any errors in here or anything like that i think everything's"
10982160,10987920," fine i want to go into the render mini map i want to go into the render mini map and maybe get rid of"
10987920,10994800," this thing so i don't think it is needed anymore um right so maybe also remove that stuff so what's the"
10994800,11004000," size of the mini map is is the mini map too big uh okay let's refresh okay so something is happening"
11004000,11011280," which is great i really like to see that well we can't see in this music okay so let me now increase"
11011280,11018960," the resolution so resolution was around 20 so that was totally fine uh-huh all right"
11018960,11024640," so that's very interesting so this is not even near enough"
11024640,11030000," to see shit i'm actually surprised that it's not enough to see shit"
11032480,11046800," so that's kind of interesting so the far clipping plane is around 10 so"
11046800,11058080," so let me see so render mean map so we're saving everything in here uh well i mean it's uh it doesn't"
11058080,11070000," remember so render floor so i'm saving i'm scaling as usual and then i'm restoring um so it is very clear"
11070000,11076800," to me that we're just not mapping this thing correctly right so we're just like not mapping all of that"
11076800,11087280," stuff correctly it's not going too far all right so we have to step"
11087280,11098320," with much smaller steps in here that's for sure that's for sure for sure it's half of the screen height"
11099600,11105040," um yeah there's like a lot of steps in here until you can even see that"
11105040,11112640," uh i feel okay so i'm going off of the feeling but i have a feeling that it's around 25"
11112640,11120720," precisely because the actual height of these things stripe is actually like half of this stuff"
11121680,11128080," um right so it's kind of a bad thing to think about and it doesn't help whatsoever"
11128080,11136480," yeah so and there is a little bit of um fish eye effect so that means i feel like this approach that"
11136480,11142880," i'm taking is not correct at all right this is not correct at all but it kind of makes sense"
11142880,11147920," it actually makes a lot of sense to to do it like that uh right the way i explained it"
11149280,11153680," but it doesn't work because it doesn't really map it uh correctly at all"
11153680,11160640," uh it doesn't really map it correctly at all um but it makes a lot of sense right it doesn't"
11160640,11164560," i think it does it's just like um"
11164560,11171440," yeah so there's a far clipping plane but for a clipping plane"
11171440,11176880," yeah so the problem here is this step but this step is not helping either so"
11177440,11183120," oh it doesn't matter okay so that's the not right way to do that that's not right the way to do that"
11183120,11187840," so let's take a look at the tutorial then so in the tutorial in the second part they kind of explain"
11187840,11196000," it but they never really uh show any um what is it called pictures that would like demonstrate"
11196000,11202240," the gist of this idea right so they never actually showed unfortunately um so how it works"
11202240,11206400," unlike the wall textures the floor and ceiling texture are horizontal so they can't be drawn"
11206400,11212160," in the same way as the walls with vertical stripes instead they're drawn with horizontal scan lines"
11212160,11217120," we figured that out actually the perspective is similar to that of walls but 90 degrees rotated"
11217920,11224960," but unlike the walls which used exactly one texture per vertical stripe"
11224960,11232720," multiple floor textures or same one repeatedly may cross our horizontal lines understandable so this is"
11232720,11238880," exactly why i decided to do it like that drawing the ceiling happens the same way as the drawing the"
11238880,11245200," floor so only the floor explained here okay also makes sense i also already figured it out the floor casting is"
11245200,11252720," done before the walls so the first we draw the entire floor then over i also figured it out right so pixels"
11252720,11260240," as before in the next step okay in short the floor casting works as following work scan line by scan line"
11260240,11267600," for the current scan line compute the position of the floor matching the left pixel of the scan line"
11267600,11277840," and the position matching the right pixel uh okay what for the current scan line compute the position on the floor"
11277840,11283440," matching the left pixel of the scan line and the position of the matching right scan line so this"
11283440,11290320," is roughly how i was imagining that right so we are scanning from top to bottom so for each pixel in"
11290320,11301360," here for left and right one we need to figure out the position okay um i i lost where okay the position"
11301360,11308720," and position matching the right this can be computed as where the ray starting from the camera going through"
11308720,11317040," the pixels of the camera plane hits the floor this can be computed as where the ray starting from the camera"
11317040,11322560," going through the pixels of the camera plane hits the floor i don't understand the senses whatever"
11322560,11326960," the formulas and explanations for this are in the floor casting code further below"
11326960,11332720," okay i'm not really interested in the code i'm interested in the idea we can then linearly"
11332720,11339040," interpolate between the leftmost and rightmost point to get the floor coordinates matching other"
11339600,11347440," by oh pixels of the scan line this works because the floor texture is perfectly horizontal if it were slanted"
11347440,11353200," we would need to do more expensive um perspective correct texture mapping instead"
11353200,11364400," i literally did that okay so uh contributed the idea okay so yeah this is my idea i suppose"
11365520,11374880," the problem here is that um i need to literally do the same way i do"
11374880,11383680," um as they explain it right so i need to do it literally the same way as they explain it so i need"
11383680,11391440," to work the other way around right so my approach my approach the the approach that i take is that i"
11392560,11399440," figure out the points on the floor i figure out the points on the floor and then i try to figure out the"
11399440,11405600," points on the screen i think that's my mistake right so i think that's my main mistake i should go the"
11405600,11414800," other way around uh so i should start from the points on the screen and figure out the points in the space"
11415280,11418720," sort of speak right i should figure out the points in the space"
11418720,11426720," so that way should be a little bit easier right so that way should be a little bit easier"
11426720,11434560," but before i do that uh let's make a small break right so i want to refill my water again again it's super"
11434560,11440880," hot it's really difficult for me to think uh right so i need to constantly drink a cold water to actually"
11440880,11448800," be able to even think at all so let's make some break um okay i'm back so essentially what they're"
11448800,11458000," suggesting they're suggesting to actually iterate through the um each individual pixel of a rectangle"
11458000,11465200," uh all of the bottom rectangle in there so that's basically what they're suggesting uh but i'm i'm not"
11465200,11470800," sure how slow is it going to be so i'm really curious let me try to do the following thing i'm"
11470800,11475200," going to just remove this kind of stuff and i'm going to literally just iterate all these things so"
11475200,11485360," it's going to be x from zero to screen width uh like this and then i'm going to iterate let from y"
11486640,11497360," maybe screen height divided by two maybe math floor math floor while y less than a screen height"
11497360,11504480," so something like this and in here let's say that we're going to fill the rectangle so i might as well"
11504480,11511440," just do a ctx uh fill style right and we're going to fill it with something like red i just want to see"
11511440,11518000," how slow iterating each individual pixel is going to be in here uh all right so this is going to be x and"
11518000,11525600," y and uh so this is going to be one and that's about it that's about it so is it compilable it seems to"
11525600,11533760," be compilable so let's go in here uh and yeah it is super fucking slow it is super fucking slow unless maybe"
11534480,11545600," we reduce the um you know the resolution a little bit or on top of that by the way um yeah"
11545600,11554480," what we can do in here uh when i'm not streaming by the way it should be faster it should be definitely"
11554480,11562080," faster it should be definitely faster and"
11562080,11572080," maybe we can even rewrite some of the parts here in c right and work uh with the pixels directly and"
11572080,11577360," stuff like that so maybe using web assembly and everything yeah so implementing all this stuff in"
11577360,11582800," c in web assembly would be actually kind of cool i think um i think it's going to be kind of cool yeah"
11582800,11591120," so all right so this is reasonable speed right so with this kind of parameter it's slow because of"
11591120,11596480," the streaming but uh when i'm not streaming it's going to be faster plus there is a lot of room for"
11596480,11602160," performance improvement it's just the fact that i can uh you know iterate this entire like a bottom"
11602160,11612640," thing in here so that's totally fine um now render floor so i have a x and y effectively all right so i"
11612640,11621600," have x um it would be even better to maybe iterate this entire thing like so all right so iterated like"
11621600,11627120," so we're iterating it by by rows uh all right so when within a single row we are iterating it like that"
11627760,11634160," um so the the main difficult thing in here the main difficult thing in here is that how you freaking"
11634160,11643520," um map the screen coordinates how you freaking map the screen coordinates to the uh to the world"
11643520,11653200," coordinates like i don't know um so you may say in terms of the distance right so we can always just like"
11654160,11668320," map this thing accordingly uh so the further away we go the smaller this entire thing become"
11668320,11672560," the further we go the smaller this thing become"
11672560,11678720," so this is a half of the screen this the object"
11680800,11689840," becomes invisible and shrinks right into the horizon when the distance is the height of the screen"
11689840,11696480," when the distance is the height of the screen so that means um"
11696480,11702080," that means the distance"
11704400,11712240," uh like if you see the bottom thing in here if you see the bottom thing in here what's the distance"
11712240,11717920," what's the distance in here what's the distance in here that's the real question"
11717920,11723280," so if it's a half of that um this stuff"
11727040,11735440," i can't answer this question because this length this length is sort of like a percentage"
11735440,11743200," uh right because we are we're using this length"
11743200,11748400," uh so the distance is more like"
11751440,11760240," let's say let's say it's h and this is sort of like a big h the h of the whole screen if we divide"
11760240,11771120," h over h so we get the the interpolator right the interpolator and that interpolator is interpolated from"
11773280,11777040," this to this to that so that means"
11777040,11785120," this entire thing is literally like the distance of this stuff so it's more like uh"
11785120,11788800," the actual distance like i can't figure it out my brain doesn't work"
11788800,11796480," my brain doesn't work it's so close but i can't figure it out because it's too hot like i just don't come"
11796480,11808480," think bottom left and bottom right of the screen are the near clipping plane with width and infieldy thank"
11808480,11810480," you so much captain"
11810480,11815920," i can't i can't do that it's so hot"
11815920,11824880," it's too hot man it's too hot it doesn't click it doesn't click i need to"
11825760,11831600," do the render minimap i need to do the render minimap bruh i'm dying"
11831600,11836640," okay okay everything's fine we'll figure it out chat we'll figure it out"
11836640,11842800," so rent this is not render minimap i need a render wall right so we're rendering the walls okay"
11842800,11849840," so it's cool it's cool it's cool um so what is the strip high okay so that's cool this is the"
11849840,11855360," distance this is the actual distance and i don't really like the style so i"
11855920,11863920," took this style out of the tutorial my favorite style is when i take the distance and sort of like"
11865040,11875600," find uh the interpolator and then i'm interpolating this entire thing right so this gives me the"
11875600,11879120," interpolator uh and"
11879120,11887360," and what's funny is that so the the bigger the distance the bigger the distance the smaller this"
11887360,11895040," entire thing has to be so i'm kind of inverting it right so yeah so i'm and because of that it actually"
11895040,11900640," worked like this okay so that's pretty cool that's explains some shit that explains some shit"
11903360,11914240," just a sec more water more water like i can't i can't somebody kill me anyways um so"
11925920,11929520," what do we do"
11929520,11942480," the easiest thing to assume the easiest thing to assume that"
11942480,11951680," point that is in here like that is straight up there that is straight up there not really here"
11952560,11959840," but straight up there but straight up there is the height of the screen so sh well i mean we called"
11959840,11968400," it h in here so this is the easiest thing to assume so it's somewhere there it's somewhere there"
11969840,11989200," um so uh let's render four so that's the point there so that means we need to take the screen"
11989200,11998800," height so this is the maximum length right and we divide it by half"
11999840,12003760," of the screen height because it's half of the like i'm going through the same"
12003760,12008640," uh through the same idea right so through the same idea but i mean"
12008640,12015440," there's nothing much i can do in there anyway so when i'm dividing this kind of thing"
12015440,12017760," um"
12017760,12020960," so that means i"
12024240,12029440," so this is you're multiplying it by one over so that means you're multiplying it by"
12029440,12034240," two divided by this kind of thing and then"
12034240,12044480," so it's a step two per pixel so it's a step two per pixel so to speak"
12045680,12052320," um all right um all right and we already can do some of that stuff so"
12052320,12059520," and honestly"
12068880,12073280," so when we kind of go into yeah that's fine"
12073280,12076960," so"
12076960,12080640," and essentially we can"
12080640,12086240," wars what was the fov yeah fov range"
12086240,12093120," i can take fov range which is going to be"
12095200,12095840," y"
12095840,12099840," multiply by two so this is our fov range"
12099840,12104560," and if we're who has a so player is fov range so we have a const"
12104560,12111200," p1 p2 so we've got this kind of stuff fov range okay"
12111200,12117280," now you can always lerp"
12120720,12126080," p2 x over screen height and that's the point"
12126080,12135520," i feel like i need a smaller resolution uh texture for it to make sense uh we'll probably"
12135520,12138880," find something at some point so this is b"
12138880,12148160," um and then i just simply need to find a pixel within this thing so i'm going to take p"
12148160,12151360," map uh x math"
12151360,12153120," floor"
12153120,12157520," and so x minus that and this is sort of like a"
12157520,12163040," texture texture coordinating here all right so this is the texture coordinate"
12163040,12168800," and now i can try to do the following thing so i can draw"
12170080,12174400," um image right draw image the image i'm going to be drawing is"
12174400,12182720," so scene floor right so i can actually just take the scene floor and as far as i know it doesn't"
12182720,12186000," really matter uh all right so get floor"
12186000,12190880," yeah we can yeah we can do that so it's going to be tile"
12190880,12200320," so floor p all right so we do floor p and if tile is the instance of"
12201600,12208640," html this shit we draw image of the tile so it's going to be x y"
12208640,12218480," um but not really so it's more so since it's a source what we have to do we have to take tile x"
12220480,12226720," uh multiplied by tile width of course math floor like so"
12226720,12233440," can you see shit math floor ty a little bit more water"
12238000,12247520," okay tile height uh all right all right so and afterwards um so the destination destination is"
12247520,12251760," actually processed forward x y one one one okay"
12251760,12255840," so i think that might be"
12255840,12264400," that might be good though i'm not sure if the yeah yeah it has to be one one because we're sampling this"
12264400,12269760," and test that so if i did everything correctly so the performance is going to be roughly the same"
12269760,12276880," and instead we're going to have some sort of a distance we can even use the"
12276880,12284800," the distance in here for lighting and what not we can we can do that but a little bit later so"
12284800,12289440," everything compiled right so where is the compilation thing in here so let's give it a try and"
12290800,12294480," okay so i never call render floor what do i"
12294480,12305200," so get floor so it is not contained okay"
12305200,12313520," so it's completely outside okay so let's actually always return floor no matter what"
12313520,12317600," right so i suppose it just like went completely outside and something really weird happened"
12318320,12326080," uh okay so let's just do that yeah okay so and it is kind of slow and the problem here is that"
12326080,12332400," the texture is too big i think that's the main problem in here like we need a smaller textures"
12332400,12340080," we need smaller textures uh how can we make a smaller texture like maybe we can find some of the"
12340080,12346240," sections here like maybe it's like 32 by 32 or whatever so they provide some of the textures here"
12346240,12354480," so yeah these ones for instance well maybe we could use these ones uh copyright id software okay so let's"
12354480,12364240," actually use them uh wolf text uh those are 64 by 64 yeah our textures are like unreasonable honestly uh"
12364240,12375440," so let me see uh yeah i don't think it's a good idea honestly i don't think it's a good idea so uh let's actually"
12376160,12382400," uh grab those in here uh and maybe move them"
12382400,12391040," somewhere here all right so do they have okay and uh let's just unzip those things"
12392400,12396960," uh a person i would maybe rename them to wolf tech um"
12396960,12402720," barrel a blue stone eagle"
12402720,12404400," uh"
12404400,12412400," so wood i really like wood um now where is the index ts"
12413600,12421760," we have floors and stuff so const would await load image data"
12421760,12425840," assets images"
12425840,12432960," can you recognize it can't see that wolf all right"
12436240,12442400," so let's grab that put it in here uh wood png"
12442400,12447840," yeah wood png and we're gonna catch the whole thing"
12447840,12459280," rgba purple rgba purple like that okay so when i'm constructing this stuff i'm gonna put wood in here"
12461440,12465040," and hopefully that will create something more reasonable"
12465040,12468880," it didn't it didn't"
12468880,12475600," man all right that's actually very interesting like it didn't create anything reasonable"
12483600,12489840," so my main problem i can't figure out how to map screen coordinates to"
12489840,12493600," world coordinates and this tutorial is not helpful in that"
12493600,12502560," this tutorial is not helpful in that um so ray deer for leftmost ray x and rightmost x width okay"
12502560,12510800," well okay you figured out ray deer so current y position compared to the center of the screen the"
12510800,12514880," horizon okay so why uh okay so this is p"
12514880,12522080," it's not explaining the main idea this is not an explanation of the main idea so that's the problem"
12522080,12529040," it doesn't explain the main idea of the thing it's just like i implemented it and dumped it into"
12529040,12535600," in into you like no it's not explaining things um it's not a good explanation honestly"
12540080,12544720," you can use the texture with the black border and white background as a flow texture to visualized"
12544720,12546320," mapping it doesn't solve the problem"
12546320,12558160," uh all right so the problem is how do we map the screen coordinates to the world coordinates that's the"
12558160,12566080," problem adding border doesn't solve that problem okay so what do we have in here um let's just i'm"
12566080,12571680," iterating from here honestly i think i'm doing something weird in here"
12571680,12579280," yeah i think i'm straight up doing something weird so if i essentially start iterating from zero"
12579280,12588160," until the half of the screen right so i'm iterating from zero until the half of the screen"
12588960,12596720," and uh i would probably should do like dy in that specific case then uh right so in here we're just"
12596720,12606560," incrementing this kind of stuff uh so this is going to be dy um so and what i have to do i have to take"
12606560,12612960," the near clipping plane and i have to keep adding um"
12612960,12619520," yeah i have i have a feeling that i have to keep adding this kind of thing so near clipping plane"
12619520,12627520," like a half of that so this is what i keep adding in there so because it just gives you the distance but"
12627520,12634640," also i need to figure out the actual y i need to figure out the actual y uh which is basically"
12634640,12640000," like a screen height minus one minus dy and this is like the actual thing"
12640000,12646240," i think that's what we have to do roughly uh okay"
12648240,12658240," it didn't it simply creates noise"
12658240,12662800," uh it simply create noise"
12662800,12668400," and nothing else just the noise"
12668400,12672640," and it's not even"
12675040,12682160," yeah man i don't know i know like i'm doing exactly as this tutorial says"
12682160,12688080," what am i missing in this logic or what am i missing like the problem is probably with like how"
12688080,12693520," i determine the distance this is the where the problem is and i can't see that"
12693520,12701680," reverse the formula from the world to screen this is literally what we did yes did you just join i think"
12701680,12707520," you just joined okay"
12707520,12713840," i don't know i don't know man i don't know"
12713840,12717680," so"
12717680,12724160," is the mapping near far to zero screen height"
12724160,12727760," not really"
12727760,12734880," it's actually half of the half of the height"
12734880,12736400," thing is"
12736400,12741200," my brain actually blows up a little bit"
12741200,12743040," because"
12743040,12747040," i am"
12747040,12753840," because i'm thinking not in in correct terms not incorrect terms"
12755360,12762400," so we have like a super near thing right which is like a near clipping plane"
12762400,12765040," right so this is a near clipping plane"
12765040,12766640," and"
12766640,12770160," the super far thing which is basically"
12770160,12772000," screen height"
12772000,12775520," all right so that's the distance"
12776800,12785920," so to figure out the price over row of height of the pixel we have to take half of the screen"
12785920,12788160," so we're taking a half of the screen"
12788160,12799200," so this maybe multiply by five and so we have to take the far minus near so this entire sort of distance"
12799760,12806400," and divide it by by sort of that i think that's the step that we have to do"
12806400,12807680," um"
12807680,12810560," all right that's basically the step"
12810560,12814880," and maybe i can even save it as a step"
12814880,12823920," and that's the step i have to use in here so that's the feeling i have right that's the feeling i"
12823920,12826320," have but i'm not 100 sure so it could be"
12826320,12831280," yeah"
12831280,12834480," so"
12834480,12837200," yeah let's give it a try"
12837200,12843520," and i'm not sure if i'd like i'm using the right version honestly like i"
12843520,12846080," i constantly need to make sure that this is not"
12847040,12853440," but parenthesis around yeah yeah thank you thank you so much uh i need to make sure"
12853440,12862640," that there's no caching involved or anything like that nope that doesn't help"
12862640,12865440," that straight up doesn't help"
12865440,12873680," it feels like it's just sampling garbage like why is it sampling garbage it's sampling within the same"
12874800,12880960," thing which is fine okay that's totally fine but it ends up sampling garbage like"
12880960,12886560," it's just like it doesn't you can't make sense of that maybe the mapping here is not correct"
12886560,12888960," um"
12888960,12897200," why are you explaining me like i'm gonna like i should not get angry at people"
12897200,12903760," uh who just explain me instead of trying to understand the actual problem that i'm dealing with"
12904800,12905840," uh"
12905840,12914000," so there's some sort of a bug or misunderstanding of the problem and i need to understand what exactly"
12914000,12923040," isn't the clipping plane in the game coordinates in a screen height in a screen screen yes"
12923040,12932160," try to see an image that is easier to see what's happened on like color each quadrant with different"
12932160,12935920," color maybe that's a good idea so"
12935920,12944960," that's okay so let's give it a try suppose so here is that"
12944960,12949920," so this is that and then that's a new clipping plane"
12949920,12956080," so that will require changing like maybe the how the floor works and everything but that's fine"
12959120,12961600," that's not really fine so uh okay let me"
12961600,12968560," so this is fp"
12968560,12978000," and the way we can do that x plus fpy right so we can just do mod two equal to zero"
12979040,12984720," and yeah this is this is a good idea actually this is a good idea thank you so much so if"
12984720,12993440," that we can just return new rgb like is that a good idea to have new rgb every time uh yeah so"
12993440,12998320," one color one right so it's going to be rgba"
13002000,13009760," or two or two so this color one rgb a red"
13009760,13014320," uh gb bloom okay"
13014320,13019920," and uh this color one"
13024800,13027120," core two all right"
13027120,13034880," so and then when i do get floor"
13034880,13037600," get rid of that"
13037600,13040560," okay"
13040560,13047200," doesn't work ah because we never actually handled this yeah that explains it"
13048800,13062080," so else uh if tile instance instance of color rgb a actually we're going to be doing ctx"
13062080,13068800," fill erect and what we have to do is actually ctx"
13070640,13077440," fill style fill style uh we take tile uh to style yeah i think it's to style"
13077440,13082480," and we're going to be using the same sort of coordinates actually x y one one right so that's"
13082480,13086000," what we're going to do uh-huh all right"
13086000,13093600," so yeah there's a little bit of fucking working here going on that's for sure"
13093600,13099280," thank you so much for suggesting that so it's obviously not fucking correct it is so"
13099280,13104160," fucking obvious that it's not correct uh all right so i'm really happy to see that"
13104160,13110320," i'm actually really happy to see that um so yeah"
13118960,13130320," it's actually rather interesting how it is like that uh so i'm doing mapping from p1 to p2"
13130320,13138640," and i get the floor and funnily enough yeah i'm just flooring this thing"
13139760,13145760," and i get the floor um um yeah this is not fucking correct"
13145760,13151200," whatsoever we don't even need this kind of thing so it's part of that stuff"
13151200,13160720," so yeah what's the actual step what if the step is one what is the step one i didn't think it's yeah"
13162960,13176880," um so let's use only one near clipping plane as the first thing but it's always blue"
13176880,13186320," uh sometimes it's just yeah that makes sense uh and so what's funny is that now i'm saying okay this is"
13186320,13192000," going to be one thing in here this is going to be one thing in here yeah so this is one"
13192000,13200080," so and that kind of makes sense okay so that kind of makes sense maybe by the way the problem here is"
13200080,13207280," that we're kind of moving forward way too fast right so what if i like reduce the step with which we're"
13207280,13216320," moving forward uh it's going to be super super small step so what about it's about figuring out"
13216320,13226400," figuring out that step yeah it's about figuring out this specific step what if i say that it's like 25"
13230400,13240800," now we're talking yeah that's what i'm talking about so it's something about this step so if it has"
13240800,13249520," to be like kind of small it's smaller than i thought initially and you look yeah there is a fish eye effect"
13249520,13254480," right so there is some sort of a fish eye effect in here which is kind of cool"
13256560,13265040," all right so this is kind of close so that means uh yeah it is trippy actually it is super trippy"
13265040,13272160," uh now what i can do is maybe switch to to the floor so i think i'm gonna do the following thing if"
13272160,13281440," true we're gonna simply return this floor otherwise we're gonna be returning something else in here"
13284640,13291600," all right so now we should be able to see we can kind of see the floor but it's really really warped"
13291600,13297360," it's really really warped uh so if i switch to this one"
13297360,13310880," okay and i don't really understand why there is a fish eye effect honestly because"
13313680,13320160," hmm"
13320160,13325920," because it's it's basically working with like a straight lines we're working only with the"
13325920,13332960," straight lines i see what i'm talking about uh it's just only street lines so i wouldn't i"
13332960,13337600," understand fish eye effect in case of the walls because we're sort of like shooting a race in sort"
13337600,13342720," sort of like a arc it's sort of like arc but it's not"
13342720,13347040," so it's kind of interesting so maybe we can't"
13347040,13349200," um"
13349200,13358080," this straight line is shorter than the closer to the plane this straight line is shorter"
13358080,13364640," when it's closer to the this is a good point actually um this is a good point that that's probably why"
13365920,13369760," um so in the way okay so we can actually"
13369760,13375680," this is very cool because we can try to"
13379040,13387600," now do the ray like we can shoot a fan of a race we can shoot a fan of race"
13389440,13394000," and just interpolate them as we go so that's one of the things we can do effectively"
13394000,13397840," all right is that a good idea honestly i don't know"
13397840,13403760," could be it could be rather interesting but it's actually taking too much time"
13403760,13405200," so uh floor"
13405200,13411440," so the thing that kind of bothers me is that in the tutorial they say oh just like you"
13411440,13416160," interpolate the lines and stuff don't don't worry about it bro just interpolate the lines we can try"
13416160,13422080," to read the the tutorial one more time uh it would be way better honestly if they just make made a"
13422080,13429280," drawing similar to how they did in the first part so because in the first part i just figured out"
13429280,13433600," majority of the things just by looking at the drawing right so stuff like that right so"
13434400,13440320," that was very helpful um yeah that was insanely helpful things like that so and then i don't even"
13440320,13445280," have to read the the rest of this stuff on here they don't really explain much they're just like"
13445280,13448960," don't worry about it just and apply something don't worry about here's the church code"
13448960,13454880," so it's just it's even funny a little bit if you think about it so um"
13454880,13463360," okay so the forecasting works as full work scanline by scanline okay for the current scanline"
13463360,13469040," compute the position of the floor matching the left pixel of the scanline and the position of matching"
13469040,13475040," the right pixel fair enough this can be computed as uh where the ray starts from the camera"
13475040,13483280," going through the pixel of the camera plane hits the floor um this can be computed as where the ray"
13483840,13491520," starting from from the camera going through starting from the camera going through that"
13491520,13496800," pixel of the camera plane hits the phone oh okay so they're already thinking in third dimension all"
13496800,13503520," right all right all right so okay that actually could be i think um right so that's something that we could"
13503520,13506000," do i think i think i think i think i think"
13506000,13517280," so now this is like this is from this side so you can think of this like z so this is the z axis and this"
13517280,13524640," is y axis so to speak right and we're looking at the center so that means we need to think about the height"
13524640,13530800," of the player as sort of like one uh all right and depending on fov right so we're gonna be"
13530800,13538240," yeah i suppose okay so that's probably what they're doing here okay that explains that explains the whole thing"
13538240,13546160," so what do you mean he's the floor i think they mean uh that you literally have to"
13547200,13553520," do the same thing as with the walls but now 90 degrees down"
13553520,13561360," so yeah i like i thought that we're gonna only do like a 2d math right on on x and z"
13561360,13566800," but now i suppose we rotate it right and now we sort of kind of shooting down"
13566800,13570160," i okay i see what they what they do okay"
13570160,13576560," so and what they're saying essentially is that you only need to do that for"
13576560,13585280," two sides left and right then later you can just interpolate it with a single line um so yeah"
13585280,13591440," yeah that that makes sense i suppose uh but that is actually"
13591440,13600560," way more time than than i expected it's actually way more time so i don't know like it's already"
13600560,13606400," third hour do i want to do that i don't want to do that especially with such a hot weather"
13606560,13612160," i don't know probably not but i mean i i guess i learned something i guess i learned something so"
13612160,13613440," this is something that i'll have to do"
13613440,13626400," yeah all right okay so i guess uh that's it for today i'll think how to organize this episode honestly"
13626400,13633600," because it's really hot like have you noticed that when it's hot it takes me so much time to get to"
13633600,13641440," something working it's just like it's so difficult for me to think it's just like it's insane uh all"
13641440,13647360," right so it's like doing the floor and the ceiling is just like takes too much time i don't i don't"
13647360,13654400," want to like a post five hours video to youtube nobody's gonna watch that so yeah all right"
13655040,13660480," uh we'll see how we can do that uh that's it for today thanks everyone who's watching right now i"
13660480,13665760," really appreciate that have a good one and i'll see you on next recreation programming session with"
13665760,13675120," uh mr uh zozin i love you okay this is the third day and i slept a little bit yet again right and i"
13675120,13681840," thought about how we can finally draw the floor and um i came i came up with a couple of ideas so first of"
13681840,13689520," um so if you try to actually simulate the projection the 3d projection of the floor"
13689520,13698000," onto the screen right so uh we can imagine that this is the player and this is the eye of the player"
13698000,13703200," and this is the screen right so this is the screen and uh essentially this is sort of like the view"
13703200,13710560," uh the field of view in here uh and also we can think about uh this thing as a floor so this is a"
13710560,13715840," floor and we're looking um at the player from the side right we're looking at the player from the side"
13715840,13723840," uh so you can probably say that this is a you you can't see that but this is a z-axis uh and this one"
13723840,13729120," is more like y-axis right so this is why so let me actually pick a different thing in here so this is"
13729120,13737040," y-axis so if you split this screen into discrete pixels right if you're splitting it into discrete"
13737040,13742400," pixels like so you're gonna end up with something interesting i think we want to actually pick a"
13742400,13750880," you know finer interval so we can fit more pixels uh in here right so it makes sense to do that up until"
13750880,13756960," the middle point the middle point is where kind of things break uh right but if you don't do the"
13756960,13764000," middle point so let's actually start shooting rays into the floor right from the eye into the floor so"
13764000,13771360," okay so this is the first ray and this is where uh we have to sample the texture of the floor so now"
13771360,13779200," if we shoot another ray through another row of pixels uh we're gonna end up a little bit further uh like"
13779200,13785600," so we're gonna end up a little bit further uh let me actually draw it in here and now let's shoot"
13785600,13794480," another ray through uh this screen it ends up somewhere here so here another here is another sample"
13794480,13800160," and so on and so forth you can already notice something interesting chat you can already notice"
13800160,13808160," something interesting and that's something interesting is that every time i go up pixels i actually shoot"
13808160,13813600," further and further and further and further and that probably explains the situation that we had"
13813600,13819440," yesterday because i was sampling at the equal intervals right i was sampling at the equal intervals"
13819440,13825680," but if you actually try to simulate the 3d projection of the floor onto the screen you're gonna end up with"
13825680,13830320," something completely different uh right so you're gonna end up with something completely different and"
13830320,13837680," and this is sort of like the sequence that grows over time so i don't know if i can yeah so it's now even"
13837680,13843760," further i don't really know what it is it feels like something quadratic uh right but that's what you end up with"
13843760,13849200," anyway that's what you end up with anyway so that's pretty cool um if you have"
13849760,13856320," let's imagine that we're currently sampling maybe like this one like we're trying to figure out the"
13856320,13864480," position of this thing so let me actually put it like this and we kind of know the angle"
13864480,13871920," uh like specifically this angle right so we kind of know specifically this angle and this angle is more"
13871920,13875920," more like alpha angle i wonder if i can actually bring my tablet maybe with the tablet it's going"
13875920,13884000," to be a little bit easier um okay so my tablet works these days today i mean uh okay so we kind of know"
13884000,13891920," this angle and we kind of know this value right let's actually call this value a and that is the value of the"
13891920,13898880," height of the player right that's the value of the height of the player so this length like the hypotenuse"
13898880,13907440," of this entire thing is c uh and this one uh let's call it the b so by knowing a and alpha we can already"
13907440,13912960," kind of figure out c but i think more importantly for us is going to be b because it's going to be"
13912960,13919280," basically a distance from the position of the player towards the point you can't see right so towards the"
13919280,13925920," point uh right that we have to sample right towards the point that we have to sample and we already kind"
13925920,13932960," of um use that formula before but actually rotate it right so from a different plane in one of the"
13932960,13941280," previous uh episodes of ray casting so essentially if you take a tan uh like tangent of the uh of alpha"
13941280,13945840," i wonder if i can actually have a little bit better uh handwriting yeah thank you so much for"
13945840,13951600," improving my handwriting so tangent of alpha what effectively you're getting you're getting the"
13951600,13957760," uh opposing side of the triangle divided by the adjacent one so opposing one is going to be b"
13957760,13965600," over a uh right so you have b over a so since you know a you can actually quite easily multiply this"
13965600,13973040," thing by a right both of the sides you multiply them by a uh the the a cancels out and you end up with"
13973040,13979920," just b so this is how you find b so as soon as you know this alpha angle you can quite easily find uh"
13979920,13986720," b and that's the distance and since you know this point you can already finally sample the precise"
13986720,13994560," texture on the floor so sounds easy enough sounds easy enough but it's not that easy right so this"
13994560,14003200," triangle is actually not as two-dimensional as you would think it's actually in 3d you need to take a"
14003200,14009440," look at this entire thing now from the from the top right you need to look at it from the top"
14009440,14016800," so let's go ahead and do that uh so this is now the screen right so this is now the screen"
14017520,14025600," uh and this is where the i is uh right and uh this is field of view it doesn't really matter what exactly"
14025600,14038000," it is and um maybe i can show the coordinates right so if this was z right now z kind of goes towards in"
14038000,14046880," here right so z goes there and this one so if this was y this is more like x right so this is more like x"
14046880,14055520," so this specific triangle so you look forward you look forward and that specific triangle is actually"
14056400,14066560," not here it is not here it is slightly at the angle in fact it is right on the edge of the field of view"
14066560,14072480," so maybe i'm going to actually make it a little bit uh you know thicker so you can see that so this exact"
14072480,14078960," triangle is at some sort of angle uh and we can call that angle something like for example better but"
14078960,14085520," we don't really care what it is honestly we don't really care what it is so the way we kind of"
14085520,14091840," sample this entire stuff is rather interesting right so we can imagine that we have a screen"
14091840,14095040," right we can imagine that we have a screen"
14095040,14102720," like so and we're sort of looking so this is the eye and we're looking at the screen like right at the"
14102720,14114640," screen and uh yeah here we're just iterating pixels of the like a lower bottom and the these points"
14114640,14120640," in here are one of these pixels so we're constantly sort of like shooting rays to all of these pixels"
14120640,14127440," right and in here as you can see this specific triangle is going to be at an angle but at that"
14127440,14138800," angle we can kind of figure out only let's say this length right we can kind of figure out this length"
14139360,14145680," so since it's on c we can say that this length is something like c prime right so it's shorter than an"
14145680,14155200," actual c and since we here we can also kind of figure out sort of like this distance right this distance and"
14155200,14163760," more like this distance yeah uh so we can say that this one is uh a prime and this is going to be b prime"
14163760,14169440," we can only figure out sort of this triangle uh right you see what i'm talking about so i'm talking"
14169440,14179120," about so but what's funny is that uh from this kind of thing from this kind of thing you see that b"
14179120,14188320," prime over alpha prime is equal to the tangent to the tangent of alpha right so if you take these two"
14188320,14193040," things you divide by another you get a tangent of alpha but tangent of alpha is also equal to"
14193040,14202560," bigger b divided by bigger a so that means you can essentially now take b prime over a prime and"
14202560,14212320," multiply it by the bigger a and you get exactly that b right so and that's basically the formula"
14212320,14222240," that we have to use to find this sort of distance that we have in here right this exact distance and"
14222240,14229200," then knowing the direction we can actually shoot the vector in that specific direction until we reach the"
14229200,14234800," point on the floor and once we have the point on the floor we can sample it if it's a texture we can take"
14234800,14240080," the color of the texture if it's just the color we can color it in a specific way and we can finally"
14240080,14249920," color this specific pixel right so what is interesting is that uh this formula is extremely simple"
14249920,14256480," uh but the justification for this formula right you have to like really think in 3d right you really need"
14256480,14263600," to think in 3d uh right so but hopefully that that makes sense um so we'll see how we can implement"
14263600,14267440," that but i think it's kind of interesting right so it's a little bit of trigonometry but you really have"
14267440,14276160," to think about it in 3d space and the tutorial that we're constantly working with um how do you get alpha"
14276160,14283840," prime well you are no you know your position in here you know the coordinates of the pixel that you are"
14283840,14290000," shooting the ray into so you have two points of the vector you you define the distance between"
14290000,14297680," these two points and here is your alpha prime so no not alpha but a prime uh so does it make sense"
14297680,14304240," because because that's what it is right so because you trust like you know the coordinates the 3d"
14304240,14309040," coordinates of this thing you know the 3d coordinates of this thing how can you find the distance between"
14309040,14314720," them you just like you know the category and uh theorem right so you just sum of squares and square"
14314720,14321600," root and you you got it so and then you can quite easily get the rest well i mean so it's actually alpha"
14321600,14326400," prime but like i mean you know all of these points just do the math right how do you explain that"
14327440,14330640," uh right so there's like not that many unknown things in here"
14330640,14341680," all right so that's basically the idea i haven't tried this idea so i just"
14341680,14348640," came up with this math uh right before the stream on the paper uh right so i don't know if this is the"
14348640,14352960," right solution to do things um i don't know if it's the right solution to do things"
14352960,14361600," so but this one is actually kind of complicated it's a little bit complicated but if we manage to"
14361600,14367200," figure it out i think it's going to be kind of poggers so the another question that i have in here"
14367200,14375600," what is the height of the player right so we have this value but what is exactly the height of the player"
14376880,14384960," so considering that we determine the height of the wall based on the distance right and we essentially"
14384960,14393440," say that distance to the wall is divided by the height of the screen we can literally say that the height"
14393440,14399360," of the player is half of the height of the screen right that's what it is like the height of the player"
14399360,14404160," is half of the height of the screen uh yeah so half of half of the height of the screen so this is kind"
14404160,14410160," of obvious that's what it is so yeah i think i think we basically have everything i think we have"
14410160,14415920," everything so we should probably try uh actually recording that oh let's go ahead and do that minor"
14415920,14432240," okay so uh where is the rendering of the game rendering of the game so let me see let me see so"
14432240,14439040," this is a render game render walls render mini map uh okay cool so we need to have a render floor"
14440000,14447200," so ctx player scene all right so and again i have no idea if it will work i don't know if whatever"
14447200,14452480," solution i just described in here is the right solution uh right so this is kind of the solution"
14452480,14459440," that was insinuated by the tutorial but the tutorial is so up to us i can't understand it so i don't know"
14459440,14464880," for sure if it is the right solution right so it's going to be a surprise maybe today's stream is going to be"
14464880,14470560," yet another failure but i mean there is no failures uh because we're just gathering information on the"
14470560,14477440," previous stream we actually uh did a first attempt uh right the first attempt and we learned that this"
14477440,14482000," is not the correct way to do that so which was actually kind of cool so we gathered some information"
14482000,14485440," uh so okay so here's the render the floor"
14487200,14489040," this is so cool imagine it being wrong"
14489040,14496320," get damn it thank you thank you for the motivation thank you for the motivation today"
14496320,14499920," anyways uh yep yep yep yep"
14499920,14508880," so what we need to do uh we need to just like start iterating the um the pixels right so we need to start"
14508880,14518480," iterating the pixels for uh let x um equal to uh standard for zero so um i think i'm going to be"
14518480,14524240," iterating the rows first right so we're going to be iterating the rows and what's interesting is that"
14524240,14530640," we don't really need to do this math for each individual pixel we only need to do that for these"
14530640,14537840," sort of pairs of pixels on the side because then as soon as we find where they hit the floor as soon as"
14537840,14544640," we find where the heat of the floor we can in a in a space just linearly interpolate from first point"
14544640,14552080," to the second point so that's pretty much it um and interestingly maybe we can even do that for"
14552080,14560480," literally just one point so we can figure out the distance from like the position of the player so this"
14560480,14565360," is sort of the position of the player to that point and then we can replicate the same distance to the"
14565360,14569520," right point and then just linearly interpolate from one to another so we don't even need to do that"
14569520,14577360," for two ends we just need to do that from one end and we can kind of mirror it uh so this is actually"
14577360,14587760," kind of cool we can actually kind of mirror it um so yeah okay so let me see because of that we're going"
14587760,14595680," going to be iterating the rows right so it's going to be a row wise situation so from zero to uh i don't"
14595680,14601360," know so it's not going to be probably from zero but more like from the half of the screen uh divided by"
14601360,14605360," two but we don't really want to go into the middle point if you know what i'm talking about so i probably"
14605360,14612160," want to do something like plus one just in case um right so and in here is going to be screen height"
14612160,14618960," plus plus y so there we go we've got these kind of things and yeah there we go so what's the 3d"
14618960,14628240," position of the player so we know the player position here and it's x and y but it's x and y on the plane of"
14628240,14638000," the scene oh this is really interesting i said that z goes in here but in the game engine z is actually"
14638000,14644000," upwards right i didn't think about that so i was thinking about z in terms of like open gl coordinates"
14644000,14651520," right because of that like x and y coordinates in the player position in here are actually like x is"
14651520,14659520," the sideways and y is forward and z is actually upwards uh right so yeah so we know the position"
14659520,14666080," and the z right so we can even maybe destructurize this entire thing so i'm going to say px the player"
14666080,14673760," x is the player position x py of the player is going to be uh player position y and pz is going to be"
14673760,14679840," half of the screen right so like this because we're looking right at the center uh we're looking right in"
14679840,14686560," the center so this is like sort of like a 3d coordinates of the eyes of the player right"
14686560,14693920," i think that makes sense because this kind of thing will uh will be useful to find the distance from the"
14693920,14700800," eye to the pixel that we're talking about right distance from the eye to the pixel right so this is"
14700800,14704960," the half of the screen you can literally see this is a half of the screen here's my eye and i find the"
14704960,14709760," distance from my eye to the to one of the pixels on the screen look at the camera look at the camera"
14710240,14716800," right so imagine that the camera is actually like this is the bottom can i actually line it right"
14716800,14722960," so this is the bottom right and we're sort of looking at the at the triangle at the bottom so here's my eye"
14722960,14729120," and the final distance from the eye to one of the pixels on your screen right so i'm looking at one of"
14729120,14737840," the pixels on the screen anyways whatever um so what do we have in here so what's the coordinates of that"
14737840,14744240," pixel that's the real question honestly what's the coordinates of the pixel so it's more like um yeah"
14744240,14753280," third eye yeah this is the third eye so it's more like a x uh so we can say this is a screen y uh this"
14753280,14762560," is a screen screen y um this is the row and the actual screen x is going to be zero so it's basically the"
14762560,14774160," leftmost pixel in there so it's it's that one it's that one but how can we find the um pixel on the screen"
14774160,14783680," that's the real question in here so this is the this is 2d coordinates on the screen"
14784320,14793120," but then if we put that screen into the 3d space what's the 3d coordinates of the pixel in that 3d space"
14793120,14801680," what's what's that that's the real question in here and in fact maybe we can easily figure that out"
14801680,14806960," because we kind of know the you know"
14808880,14816560," the um how to say that where the screen is located within the space right so in the player"
14816560,14823280," we have a fov range right so here's the fov range and it gives you two points in here which are rather"
14823280,14831280," interesting so it gives you p1 and p2 uh all right so it's a very important and interesting function"
14831280,14837120," honestly so let me show you what it means so imagine that we're looking at the player top uh you know from"
14837120,14840240," the top so we're looking at the player from the top so we're looking at the player from the top and the"
14840240,14850640," player has a certain sort of fov right this screen is in here this screen is in here and this point is"
14850640,14864000," called p1 and this one is called p2 like this so and this is the screen in the 3d space and these two"
14864000,14868880," points are 2d points they just show you the the range of like where this screen is located in the"
14868880,14875120," 3d space so and if you have a player you can just click okay so what is your fov range right fov"
14875120,14883760," ranges it's basically from p1 to p2 so which is kind of cool so that means that uh since sx is equal to"
14883760,14893200," zero right so it's basically p1 so that thing in terms of like uh this 3d space is located at"
14894000,14907440," p1 so we can easily say uh right we can easily say that sx is p1x and sy uh is p1y so that means this"
14907440,14917280," one again has to be z right it all that is has to be z right so and since the height of the player the"
14917280,14924960," height of the screen is the height of the screen we can just use that as this"
14924960,14942320," chat that is very interesting we view the coordinates of the screen as with y going down"
14943520,14953600," but the z in the game space actually goes up so that means in here to get the actual sort of z"
14953600,14959840," so let me actually call it something like like z so s z is going to be the opposite one so it's going"
14959840,14969280," to be something like a screen height minus z also minus one or something okay i think i figured all of"
14969280,14976320," these things out i think i did so this is the 3d coordinates of the player of the player's eye"
14976320,14982320," these are 3d coordinates of the pixel that we're currently looking at"
14984000,14988880," do you understand what the fuck is going on do you understand what the fuck is going on"
14988880,14996720," so yeah uh so that means i can now do the following shit i can do uh like maybe dx um right so dx is"
14996720,15003280," going to be s x minus px all right and let's actually repeat that for y so x y boom and then"
15003280,15010800," i'm going to replace a y with z boom so we have dx dy dz so then we can take squares of all these"
15010800,15016400," motherfuckers we're taking the squares of all these motherfuckers and we are uh taking a square root"
15016400,15027360," math square root and you know what we just found you know what we just found we found uh c prime"
15027360,15035120," that's what we just found like literally so here is the 3d coordinate of the eye the 3d coordinate of the"
15035120,15040880," pixel but we only found it for like the left side but it doesn't really matter because like"
15040880,15049760," once we find find b once we find b you can use it at the length for sort of this side for this"
15049760,15054720," direction so you can mirror this entire thing so you can simply mirror this entire stuff so it doesn't"
15054720,15060480," really matter uh so yeah that's pretty cool so this is c prime so i'm gonna call it cp"
15061760,15071280," it it stands for c prime okay uh all right so cp and uh what is uh do we even need cp"
15071280,15077600," i don't think we need cp honestly yeah because we're using b prime and a prime so we don't need that"
15077600,15082560," since we don't need that like i probably don't need to even compute dx dy dz"
15082560,15092960," right so fuck that so but what is effectively a prime so we're gonna say ap so what is ap ap"
15092960,15103440," is basically uh sz right so it's it's basically sz so this is that uh because it's sort of like"
15105120,15117600," um it's not really a length right so it's more like sz minus um player z right so so this since"
15117600,15124640," it's a z coordinate so we take the biggest one ah it actually goes up so that means it has to be the"
15124640,15128960," player one minus sz but it doesn't matter you can always do absolute but i think the player one is"
15128960,15135760," going to be that anyway so this is the length that we have in here so b is rather interesting b is the"
15135760,15144720," one that is going to be slightly like rotated so that means we actually still need to uh do the um"
15144720,15147520," you know pythagorean theorem"
15150480,15157360," but slightly differently we can actually do that on the um into d rather than 3d we don't have to do"
15157360,15169680," that in 3d we can just do that into d um so how can we do that so this is busy so we can do px py"
15169680,15179280," right so this is basically px py i can just take the new vector px py and i don't even have to do that"
15179280,15184320," because new uh vector to px py is just a player position right it's just a player position so this"
15184320,15190880," is the first one and the second one that i kind of need to subtract from actually i need to subtract"
15190880,15198880," that thing from from the thing that i'm going to just say um it's the screen i suppose it's a screen"
15198880,15208080," x and screen y right so it's a new vector sx and sy which we don't even need because it's just p1 as you"
15208080,15217120," can see so sx and sy is just like p uh p1 right so we are subtracting uh p1 from this one and uh that"
15217120,15224480," gives us the length right so this is the length and that's a that is basically a b right that is basically"
15224480,15236880," a b pretty cool so uh not a b but bp right so it's a b prime so now the formula is b prime over a prime"
15236880,15246080," b prime multiplied by actual a which is the height of the player right so which is pz"
15246080,15252480," and that gives us the like the length the actual b"
15252480,15256560," and that's it honestly"
15259360,15268960," so we basically found the length what we need to do what we need to do we need to take uh p1 uh"
15268960,15277520," subtract player position subtract player position normalize it right so it's just one and scale it"
15277520,15286080," to b and we found the first sort of flag uh from which we have to start interpolating so i don't really"
15286080,15292080," know how to call this kind of thing so but i'm gonna call it uh i'm gonna call it like t1 right so this is"
15292080,15298400," gonna be t1 and the second one is gonna be t2 but it's basically the same but from p2 to player position"
15298400,15308960," and we scale it by b there we go so now now now now we are iterating uh x right so we are iterating x from"
15308960,15319120," zero to screen width right from zero to screen width uh something like this and we are interpolating t so"
15319120,15331200," so basically t1 lerp into t2 with x over screen widths there we go t is the coordinate on the floor"
15331200,15337520," this is the most important thing in here it is the coordinate on the floor"
15337520,15345920," this is actually kind of cool believe it or not this is actually kind of cool so i think"
15345920,15354480," that's the whole formula in here that's the whole formula uh so yes yes yes we don't really need s x in"
15354480,15365280," here right so this is that uh and c z is basically an inversion uh of this entire stuff so it's really"
15365280,15372320," easy to lose yourself with this within these computations but i mean yeah that's that's ray casting for you"
15372320,15377440," that's essentially ray casting so anyway uh what are we going to be doing in here uh we need to"
15377440,15384800," basically get this in and get the floor uh at t right so we're getting the floor at t"
15384800,15390960," and it gives us the color as of right now so if i understand correctly right so it gives us the color"
15390960,15398880," so this is going to be basically uh the tile right so this is the tile and if tile is instance of"
15399920,15405440," if the tile is instance of rgba uh something like this um"
15405440,15420720," so rgba um now we don't even yeah we don't really even need to look into the coordinates right so we"
15420720,15425040," only need specific coordinates if we want to do the texture sampling right so we don't support texture"
15425040,15431440," right now so it's totally fine so we can just use t as a color now we need to figure out the"
15431440,15440880," position of the pixel on the screen right so um let me see so we already know x which is totally fine"
15440880,15447680," z we can use z as y right so because the actual z within the space is inverted or like stuff like that"
15448320,15454880," since it's inverted i think i'm going to call it y right so this is going to be just y uh right and"
15454880,15464000," because of that this is why okay cool uh huh so it's going to be draw uh maybe ctx feel erect"
15464000,15471600," so this is going to be feel erect and uh how are we going to be doing all of that so we need to scale this"
15471600,15478640," entire stuff to this screen scale right we need to scale it to the screen scale so let's actually"
15478640,15484800," put this thing in here and at the end of this entire thing we're going to do ctx restore right"
15484800,15490800," so we're going to be doing ctx restore so afterwards uh what do we do so"
15492400,15503040," we have to do x y right so this is x y and one one but on top of that we have to set feel uh feel style"
15503040,15513680," is it feel style why are you hanging okay so tile uh to style all right i think i got it"
15513680,15517680," i think i got the funniest thing in here is that we you don't need that stuff as well"
15518400,15520640," all right so you don't really need that stuff as well"
15520640,15530160," okay okay okay okay okay so this is vp then you do that um all right so that's pretty cool"
15530160,15539040," so what's the size of the whole thing so it's probably 20 okay so it compiles right so it seems"
15539040,15546000," to be compiling so i just what i did is just like translated this entire like math to code right so i"
15546000,15549520," don't know i don't know if it's going to work so maybe it's it's actually like a bad idea to do it"
15549520,15559440," like that uh all right that's very interesting it's doing something but it's actually super uh oh"
15559440,15563040," it's super slow but it's it's something"
15563040,15570160," huh all right that's very interesting"
15573280,15580720," it kind of works but i think there is a little bit of the problem in here uh so first of all let me"
15580720,15587840," maybe reduce the size of the screen right so because i think the size is first try almost first try but"
15587840,15592400," it doesn't work exactly as i want but the perspective seems to be correct the perspective seems to be"
15592400,15595520," correct uh right okay so"
15595520,15605520," yeah so it doesn't feel okay so it feels static but in terms of rotation it looks it looks correct"
15605520,15613200," right something wrong with how we sample this entire so let's actually do render floor and let's see what"
15613200,15620400," is going on here so it seems to be like standing which is kind of bizarre to me all right so the it doesn't change the position"
15620400,15627840," um oh i see what is going on i see i see i see we have to be adding then player position yeah so player"
15627840,15634320," position uh position add right so this is a player position add and this is a player position"
15634320,15641440," add maybe you can get rid of the like player position adding or something but i mean that's totally fine"
15642320,15652960," so are you recompilable okay so that seems to be fine okay yeah yeah yeah so that feels out of sync with"
15652960,15661600," actual walls as you can see that is it it is correct don't get me wrong but it's completely out of sync"
15661600,15669440," with uh with whatever we have in here all right you see what i'm talking about uh but i mean it's already"
15669440,15673920," better than we had before than whatever we had before that's already much better like it feels"
15673920,15679440," like a legit thing now uh also yeah i didn't do anything with the middle line i wonder if i"
15679440,15686000," what if i just include the middle line will it work uh it's moving against you yeah it's kind of weird"
15686000,15689360," well i mean no it's it's actually moving correctly i think"
15692720,15700080," yeah so essentially if you take the walls and you disable the walls if you simply disable the walls"
15700080,15713280," uh it looks all right right so it's just like the um the cells don't match the actual walls the end"
15713280,15718880," simulator yeah that's probably what it is uh the cells don't match the actual walls and i kind of wonder"
15718880,15724960," why is that because of the height of the player uh right is that because of the height of the player"
15724960,15729440," i don't really know so what if i say that the height of the player is actually screen screen high but i"
15729440,15736240," mean it's not based on anything uh right it's based on just like a feel no it's actually not okay"
15736240,15746480," so but what if i divide it by four no it has to be half it has to be half right okay so i don't really"
15746480,15753520," know like what exactly is going on here and why is it like that uh but let me let me actually see i don't"
15753520,15761520," think there's there are any problems in here in the get floor situation right because we just floor the"
15762320,15767680," the particular point right so we we hit the floor with the particular point uh and we just floor it"
15767680,15773360," and that means we effectively get the coordinates of this entire thing uh right and then we just sum up"
15773360,15778240," x and y and depending on whether it's even or odd we just give you the color and that's about it"
15778240,15788240," so why um the walls themselves would not uh fit the tile map the floor is matching the tiling in the"
15788240,15795920," minimap the floor is you think it is matching the tiling in the minimap is it i don't i don't actually"
15795920,15805760," think so i don't actually think so so the oh you mean the walls actually match in the minimap but the floor"
15805760,15814320," doesn't match the minimap so there is a clear discrepancy in here and i wish i knew why i really wish i knew"
15814320,15820400," why so let me maybe think a little bit about that"
15820400,15828960," ah we're just iterating it doesn't look like it matches minimap but the floor tiles are bigger um"
15833600,15840960," hmm maybe it's the wall that don't match the minimap"
15840960,15850800," maybe that's the problem no it actually doesn't look like like that um is it of half a cell um"
15854000,15857200," i honestly don't know i honestly don't know"
15857200,15866160," there's like minus is missing somewhere all right so let's maybe make a small break we're already having"
15866160,15871200," a like a better progress today right so this is already better than what whatever we had yesterday"
15871200,15878000," uh so yeah they just like so big on this line i don't think they have to be this big"
15879280,15885760," um that is true the red blue squares should be size of the wall yeah so they should be a size of the"
15885760,15894400," wall they feel too big they do in fact feel too big and i don't really know why right so like what's"
15894400,15904000," up with them being this fucking huge uh yeah it's sort of like a double the size all right anyway so let's"
15904000,15907600," let's make a small break and after the break we're gonna uh try to figure out so i need to"
15907600,15913840," pour myself a little bit more water okay so one idea that i had uh is that"
15913840,15919440," when we are rendering the walls we also added a little bit like a anti-fish eye"
15919440,15927360," hack and i feel like that maybe that anti-fish eye hack actually sort of makes the um"
15928320,15934960," the floor and the wall be incompatible right so to confirm or deny that i think what we should do"
15934960,15940960," we should bring that hack back so the way we do that uh so this is the distance that we're talking"
15940960,15952000," about uh and this is the distance from the obstacle to the projection plane from the obstacle to the"
15952000,15958000," projection plane but not uh to the eye of the player so what we have to do uh we have to do"
15958000,15964000," the full living thing oh my god so i need to take the point where we hit the obstacle and i have to"
15964000,15969760," subtract that from the player position and i have to take the length of this entire thing and that should"
15969760,15975760," bring back the fish eye effect hopefully so there's a compiler seems to be compiling so i'm going to go back"
15975760,15984640," into the into this thing and let me actually refresh and no fish eye effect what the where is the oh okay"
15984640,15990160," oh this is so cool i brought back the fish eye effect so you you can clearly see that there is"
15990160,15998080," a little bit of a fish eye effect you can clearly see that but the the floor is not matching still"
15998080,16004880," the floor is not matching still so at least this is something so is it clear that there is a fish eye"
16004880,16011120," effect i think we can actually go maybe around here yeah you can clearly see the fish eye effect though"
16011120,16016240," it's not really that big of a fish eye effect i don't know why i was trying to get rid of that"
16016240,16024080," yeah it actually kind of looks cool honestly it kind of looks cool huh i really like that look at that"
16029040,16034800," yeah floor move fast yeah i know that i know that so i brought back the fish eye effect specifically"
16034800,16040560," just to see that we can get rid of the floor for now just to see how cool it looks without the floor"
16040560,16043840," yeah there we go it actually works faster"
16043840,16053600," yo why did i get rid of that it actually looks super cool i mean it's okay it's a little bit nauseating"
16054240,16061680," uh yeah so if it were like a long corridor i think i would start vomiting by looking at it for too long"
16061680,16069360," right it's not a particularly great idea so uh where's the render the walls uh okay let's bring back this"
16069360,16081760," stuff okay yeah one more time yeah much better no fish eye effect no fish eye effect pretty poggers minor for in the"
16082240,16089120," so you can see the limits of the cube thanks to the textures before the plane course it was"
16089120,16095840," far worse honestly true i think maybe that's the case actually here maybe that's the case"
16095840,16101040," render floor let's bring back rendering of the floor and the rendering of the floor"
16101040,16107600," does something a weird so rendering of the floor is just like yeah"
16109760,16116240," what maybe it just goes too far wait a second"
16116240,16122240," when i"
16122240,16126720," in all honesty"
16126720,16136640," the i never actually took into account the like a near clipping plane but i never had to because i have"
16137280,16142160," just this uh this point in here right i just have this point in here"
16142160,16144320," uh also"
16144320,16151040," what if i interpolate them in a different order maybe that's the problem no i don't think so i'm already"
16151040,16155920," guessing this point like if you start guessing that's a that's a bad sign right so you should not"
16155920,16166800," be doing that guessing is kind of mad honestly um okay so yeah we have p1 and this is the player position"
16166800,16176560," player position um all right so bp uh so we take p1 we subtract player position"
16176560,16184960," and we take the length of this entire stuff and that's basically that b in here that we got right so"
16184960,16192400," so that's basically that b in here uh okay and what is a a a is"
16192400,16202720," s z so i think maybe something with s z honestly"
16202720,16212000," because we're doing the y and coordinates why i go from zero to height but the z in our case goes from like"
16212000,16219360," zero in here to the height so we kind of like invert this entire thing right so and that's why this is"
16219360,16221760," the size z coordinate and"
16225200,16233360," the a is the this thing minus this thing which is obviously going to be smaller um so make a long"
16233360,16238240," corridor in in the invisible portal at the end we haven't finished making an engine"
16244240,16251680," so i feel like there is a problem with a somewhere that's what i feel that's what i feel about this"
16251680,16258240," entire stuff there's a problem with a um i don't see any problems in here so this is x and y everything"
16258240,16267680," should be fine uh we go from here to here and yeah okay so the only potential problem is somewhere here"
16268800,16276560," the only potential problem is somewhere here so let me let me see"
16276560,16284880," so if i'm iterating so it's going to be half if it becomes bigger bigger"
16288320,16295120," no i don't see any problems man i don't even know how to debug this"
16295120,16302640," console log yeah maybe we should start doing console log uh on top of that maybe i can"
16302640,16315040," maybe i can try to just debug that uh like literally in the console right so let's actually have some sort of"
16315040,16324080," like a test ts right where i'm going to simply move uh the screen width and height right so this is a screen"
16324080,16331440," width and height uh right so do we have test does it automatically so it's already compiled test so i can"
16331440,16343680," try to do console log uh screen width screen height screen width screen height and then i can do node test"
16343680,16358080," j s okay so that makes sense so in here when i do render floor render floor um i can start iterating y"
16358080,16365920," right so we're basically iterating y and let's just do console log uh y just to see like in terms of why"
16365920,16371440," of the screen right so where are we iterating the whole thing uh right so i'm going to try to run it yeah"
16372240,16379520," so starting from 45 up until 89 and the height of the screen is that so looks good to me honestly i"
16379520,16383520," don't see any problems in here so this is width uh and this is height"
16383520,16394320," and everything is all right so let me try to do that okay so that's pretty cool so then uh what i do i"
16394320,16401360," actually transform that into z and z is actually starts from the bottom as zero and goes up right"
16401360,16409360," so if i do s z uh right so yeah and it's all i mean we're iterating it from the bigger one but it doesn't"
16409360,16418240," really matter right so just what's important is that for yeah for that one it's it's just that uh so for the"
16418240,16425920," player then we take the p z which is the z position of the player right so this is a z position of the"
16425920,16435840," player uh-huh and a is the difference between these two things right so and we can do ap uh right so"
16435840,16443200," and it ends up being basically the same right it doesn't matter or maybe wait a second maybe it didn't"
16443200,16450480," recompile yeah it didn't recompile properly so it's just like initial like difference of a right it's"
16450480,16460800," it's this thing it's this one right it's this one so and then we do uh bp which is the"
16460800,16463680," yeah"
16473200,16481280," so what's funny is that that just means that we never have to"
16481280,16489040," yeah we never have to recompute it in here so we can kind of pre-compute this entire thing"
16489040,16496080," if this is like how we do that we can just recompute this thing uh right then we divide bp"
16497760,16505520," b by p so it's an opposing one and this is a tangent so then we can multiply it by"
16505520,16513840," pz which is the whole thing which will extend it and give us uh the bigger b"
16513840,16518000," by which we can now scale the rest of this stuff"
16519680,16522720," um i don't see the problem"
16522720,16531280," so i debugged some something similarly annoying to debug by rendering the numerical values"
16531280,16538160," on the screen itself rather than console logging or similar uh sure but i mean even as a console"
16538160,16544880," logs these things they don't really explain to me what the f is going on so yeah so the wall seems to be"
16544880,16552160," like half of that but i probably need to divide something by half but what exactly like i don't"
16552160,16558080," fucking know what exactly i have to divide in it but by half it doesn't doesn't make any sense um"
16558080,16570400," so far like it feels like a like i made a mistake somewhere but i double checked everything and i don't see"
16570400,16578720," a mistake anywhere uh should it be bp multiplied by cosine of beta why"
16578720,16587760," why should it be multiplied by cosine of this is a good okay so you caught my attention actually this"
16587760,16590400," is something interesting uh right"
16593040,16595360," why should it be multiplied because"
16595360,16603520," we just need its length we know the height of it and the height is here and the better is just like"
16603520,16611120," it doesn't really matter honestly like it doesn't be is the floor supposed to move yes"
16611120,16618800," why does it be does it have to be cosine of beta it doesn't make sense"
16619440,16625360," i can multiply it by the cosine of beta and cosine of beta by the way is half of the fov"
16625360,16631520," cosine of beta fov half of that but i don't think it's going to solve anything"
16631520,16640880," uh wait nothing changed did it recompile okay so something about the test"
16642720,16657200," index oh just a second so fly check what what's that cannot re ah it's because of the test okay so let"
16657200,16660800," me let me remove this and test that refy now okay"
16663280,16669760," yeah it doesn't doesn't change anything so it doesn't really change anything"
16669760,16679360," so do you have a redefinition um okay so everything's fine render floor"
16679360,16688080," no i don't think it has to be that i don't think it has to be that"
16688720,16691520," what am i missing what am i missing in this thing"
16691520,16701680," can you make the player higher when rendering the floor it feels like you're closer to the floor than"
16701680,16707920," the render this is a cool idea okay so what if the player height is actually it's the full screen height"
16709520,16714400," what if it's dead what if it's actually that"
16714400,16719120," i think this could be it your uh"
16719120,16724720," uh your illustration assumes the screen is touching the floor"
16724720,16732560," yeah so you mean something like this"
16732560,16738320," so so what it assumes that it's touching the screen is it something bad to touch the screen i don't"
16738320,16742720," understand the implication of that phrase what what's up with that phrase okay it is touching the floor so"
16742720,16749600," what um easiest way to okay whatever um so"
16749600,16760320," but because like it just makes sense that this is the height i feel like if i'm going to be making the"
16760320,16765600," player higher if i'm going to be making the player higher that means i have to redo all the competitions"
16765600,16766000," in here"
16766000,16775840," i think p1 sub position is always particular to the camera not pointing down the i know that's the point"
16775840,16782800," that's kind of the point because that thing is b so yeah that thing is like here"
16784320,16790080," we computed this length and that's why it has been particular because we that's what we want that's"
16790080,16790640," what we want"
16790640,16791920," um"
16791920,16815600," what's interesting is that the logic is correct the logic is fully correct otherwise we wouldn't see a"
16815600,16820800," correct floor the floor is correct that's the thing the floor is fully correct"
16820800,16827280," it's just it doesn't match the thing so something with the scaling uh doesn't work"
16827280,16831040," uh so ap multiplied by two that's an interesting idea"
16831040,16835680," we can give it a try okay so let's multiply by two"
16837760,16843760," so did it recompile i don't know if it's like i hate web uh-huh what about have"
16843760,16846880," all right so"
16846880,16856960," did it recompile i don't know if it to be compiled or not okay so none of that helped uh okay so doesn't"
16856960,16859440," why"
16866880,16872960," did it recompile or not or is it cached again man i i hate web"
16872960,16881200," so did you cache like i'm doing ctrl shift r ctrl shift like"
16881200,16886720," fucking uncache already dude oh my god"
16886720,16891440," i also changed the okay so"
16894240,16900000," how people like try like enjoy programming in this platform like i don't understand because you can"
16900000,16904400," never fucking know you can never fucking know um"
16904400,16912400," so everything is yeah everything is correct in here but i mean"
16912400,16922640," i genuinely don't see the problem i genuinely what about what if i do p2 in here i don't think it's there"
16923360,16929600," uh i know that i can disable the cache in the console it doesn't work if the console is not"
16929600,16937440," opened that's the dumbest thing about web tools is that for the cache to be disabled dev consoles has"
16937440,16942880," to be opened as soon as you close them that tick that you put in there stops working and you do have"
16942880,16948720," have to do ctrl shift r and shit like that"
16948720,16953760," like like like i don't understand like people who suggest oh you can actually disable it in dev console"
16953760,16959440," do you guys know how dev console work like people who suggest that do you guys know how it works"
16959440,16965600," uh okay it's just like don't understand why you're suggesting them"
16968960,16971920," um all right"
16971920,16983200," so if it's something about fov"
16989920,16996160," and do you know what what if i try to do that on the level of a mini map let's go into the mini map i think i've got an idea like so the problem with this kind of stuff is that"
16996160,17006400," so the problem with this kind of stuff is that"
17006400,17008320," how do i even fucking debug"
17008320,17008320," right"
17008320,17010240," so the problem with this kind of stuff is that"
17010240,17021680," how do i even fucking debug"
17021680,17022400," right"
17022400,17024720," because"
17024720,17027920," i don't see a flaw in the logic"
17027920,17032560," right so because there's two layers in here there's first mathematical logic in here"
17032560,17034240," and there is a second layer"
17035120,17036000," you know"
17036000,17037200," implementation of logic"
17037200,17040240," i checked the mathematical logic"
17040240,17041600," i don't see any flows"
17041600,17042080," okay"
17042080,17043760," i checked the implementation logic"
17043760,17044640," i don't see any flow"
17044640,17045520," okay now what"
17045520,17050880," right so like how do you even fucking debug that because like"
17050880,17052080," you debug that that"
17052080,17055840," when you know that for example logic is correct"
17055840,17057760," but the program is doing something incorrect"
17057760,17060320," and you can work out the discrepancy in here"
17060960,17065920," right so but i didn't see flows in the logic right so it's just like everything should be correct"
17065920,17072320," um right so it's it's kind of bizarre one thing we can try to do one thing we can try to do we can"
17072320,17076160," try to uh render all that stuff on the level of a mini map"
17076160,17084480," right so just to see if it kind of like uh works out the way that we expect it to work out or something"
17085360,17088960," uh okay so the mini map is is a little bit bigger now so which is good"
17088960,17096320," um okay so let's go into the floor maybe the render floor and"
17096320,17101600," yeah let's go uh so render mini map"
17101600,17110160," okay so rendering the mini map so this is a player magenta and the shot like that okay that's cool"
17111760,17117440," um okay so maybe i can try to do something like this"
17117440,17131040," uh-huh so as we are rendering this entire stuff so what we can do is just fill a circle fill"
17131040,17141040," circle ctx in here um so when i'm filling the circle i'm actually using t as a center and the other thing"
17141040,17145920," is that we specify the radius so let's actually say that this is going to be the radius maybe it has"
17145920,17153440," to be something like super small so and maybe we're going to be doing only like the first iteration"
17153440,17164960," uh right can i have two lets in here so if i can say let i zero i can't even have several lets in here"
17164960,17177840," because it's okay apparently i can so let's say two uh plus plus i uh i said i comma comma i actually am"
17177840,17182320," all right so okay you can actually do it so you're telling me that i can do like that"
17182320,17190400," okay i didn't know that all right i'll know that um that's pretty cool so we have only one row right so we"
17190400,17199600," have only one row and let's see if we can now do something about that okay so this is actually two"
17199600,17207920," many rows uh-huh all right so we can kind of see all of these things so this is how they go"
17209760,17217360," uh-huh that explains it that's a little bit too far honestly right that's a little bit too far"
17219760,17221680," hmm and if we"
17221680,17227680," yeah honestly that's like really far"
17227680,17236560," what's up with that so if i change the fov to a little bit narrower how is it going to change this"
17236560,17237200," entire thing"
17238560,17248160," uh-huh so if i change the near clipping plane to like five to half because i want to be able to see"
17248160,17255760," uh are you are you working on it all right oh i feel like i didn't properly compile shit"
17257600,17266160," yeah god damn it"
17266160,17274960," so if we is have it's going too far it is going too far"
17277600,17279440," hmm it is going too far"
17279440,17293680," so we can already clearly see that we can already clearly see that so render mini map"
17302640,17308400," i still think the p1 and p sub should be different you are not this is not a helpful message you're"
17308400,17314240," just distracting me to tell me a non-helpful message please stop doing that uh don't abuse my"
17314240,17321520," my trust to you just to tell me just like some useless message don't do that please um all right"
17321520,17329920," okay now i need to recollect my thought again now i need to recollect myself again because"
17329920,17341360," a good knocked off by useless marriage um okay so"
17341360,17346080," yeah"
17346080,17358080," if we understand this kind of stuff correctly so we have these two things we have a and b if we divide b"
17358800,17366240," by a that is b is an opposing to the angle right so it is opposing to the angle divided by a which is"
17366240,17373680," adjacent right so in the tangent of that is uh alpha the tangent is going to be a relationship between"
17373680,17382400," a bigger b right between a bigger b uh and that thing so yeah"
17387520,17392560," i feel like it just scaled up too much"
17392560,17403520," what if we kind of assume that the height of the i have a strange idea on this way"
17403520,17408720," the height of the player the height of the player is"
17408720,17410800," half"
17412480,17420800," or zero five so this is the height of the player and when we're doing z all right so okay we're doing"
17420800,17426000," this kind of stuff but then we're just dividing by dividing that by screen height"
17426000,17432080," we're just dividing it by screen height so what if the the size of the screen is just like literally"
17432080,17441040," one right so and the size of the player is like half is it going to do anything maybe maybe it's maybe it's wrong to to think it this way"
17441040,17447440," uh but i don't fucking know um did it recompile does it do anything"
17447440,17456000," it still goes too far like i do i didn't fucking know did it recompile"
17456000,17460240," uh all right so i need to dock out the the thing"
17461760,17465680," uh please so yeah separate window"
17465680,17469360," so"
17469360,17476560," it didn't really change anything so that's that's fine it didn't really change anything"
17481440,17486880," so it still goes too goddamn far"
17486880,17495120," it still goes too goddamn far"
17495120,17502640," why would it be damn what's the problem here like what's the fucking problem here like"
17503440,17505680," all right so i can clearly see um"
17505680,17516800," i can clearly see that it just goes too far that means maybe this kind of thing is just like too big"
17516800,17523280," maybe that's what's going on uh it still goes too far like i don't know if it really like i'm refreshing it"
17523280,17529680," correctly so what screen row i'm not showing any screen rows on the new map though wait wait wait"
17529680,17535520," you you're good okay so i see what you mean i see what you mean let's actually yeah you're right"
17535520,17542400," right right right right right i see i see i see i see i see uh okay so that's a good point it's a good point"
17542400,17547680," all right"
17547680,17564560," i think there is a potential in here okay um so let's"
17565840,17572960," can i disable this code by just doing false i think i can now i'm going to bring that code back"
17572960,17579120," into the render floor if it works it's going to be kind of bad because i have no idea why it works"
17579120,17582720," so this is going to be this"
17588320,17595600," so now we are basically assuming that the size of the screen is kind of like one"
17595600,17604960," so tile and we need to do a scene get floor t"
17604960,17609520," we're going to work we're going to so this has to be tile yeah of course"
17612560,17618480," okay so there's a compiler seems to be compiling so i want to take the render minimap"
17618480,17622000," and let's move it to like 30"
17622000,17631440," i wonder does devtool caching work like disabling caching work if devtool is out of the focus"
17633120,17638960," i wonder if it does uh"
17638960,17642720," okay i disabled the render in the floor okay"
17642720,17644720," uh"
17644720,17648800," nah it doesn't work"
17657040,17658400," it's still too big"
17658400,17665920," what am i missing it's something super dumb like i swear to god because like um"
17665920,17673360," can you parenthesis i don't think it matters honestly because uh usually this kind of operations"
17673360,17678160," like division and multiplication they uh they evaluated from left to right um"
17679520,17681600," so somebody suggests to"
17681600,17688480," to do this kind of thing so to do the other way around i don't think that's how it works"
17688480,17690640," yeah it doesn't matter"
17690640,17700960," so i have to make some improvements mine is also slow of fact so it seems to be performed way better"
17700960,17705120," because i have a like a lower resolution actually intentionally did a lower resolution"
17708240,17712160," here we try this uh square screen theory okay so let's give it a try"
17712160,17715360," so i'm gonna actually do nine by nine"
17715360,17717360," right"
17717360,17729360," well i mean okay so there is it like two layers to that there is an actual shape of the canvas element"
17729360,17734800," right the actual shape of the canvas element and the resolution of rendering right so they are not"
17734800,17739920," necessarily matching let's let's put it this way they're not necessarily matching"
17739920,17747040," uh right so square screen doesn't work what else does anybody have any other ideas"
17747040,17749440," um right so"
17749440,17757840," so there was an idea with something player sub x and somebody said that okay you have to do something"
17757840,17764000," different here but what exactly what exactly different i have to do here it's not helpful so"
17764000,17769360," should i not normalize it uh i don't know it's not it's not particularly helpful to say that oh you"
17769360,17777120," should do something different what exactly what exactly different i have to do here um so i don't actually think so"
17778960,17782960," maybe okay so maybe okay so what if i well i mean"
17782960,17795120," uh ap2 but didn't i already try ap2 people do do you watch the stream do you watch the stream didn't i"
17795120,17801600," already try ap2 it literally didn't help unless i just don't refresh it properly"
17803200,17808640," uh try multiply but like i literally just tried what are you guys talking about there we go this is"
17808640,17810400," multiplied by two so"
17821520,17829760," so i just multiplied by two so you said i just did whatever you suggested so all right i like"
17829760,17841520," why would it not work okay so let's try to see maybe tutorial yet again uh so the the problem with"
17841520,17846560," this tutorial maybe you're missing minus one somewhere since the floor is moving the wrong way"
17846560,17849760," how is it moving the wrong way it just moves faster"
17849760,17858000," no how is it removing like no it's not moving wrong way what are you talking about am i missing something"
17858000,17863840," um if i remove the walls and if you just look at that without the walls"
17863840,17871760," that looks correct to me like where where do you say that the wall the floor is moving incorrectly"
17874320,17876560," like it looks correct to me if you just remove the walls"
17876560,17885600," it's just like it's fine it's just the walls are like not matching uh right it's just like not"
17885600,17897440," matching optical illusion yeah maybe uh is it is it already man like i enabled the walls please recompile"
17901920,17903520," it's where to get web technologies"
17903520,17910560," your point of view is too close to the wall somehow maybe maybe that's what's going on"
17910560,17921120," oh man i hate this so this is a screen height the half of the screen height this thing is that"
17921120,17931200," i'm so disappointed it's i'm so close i'm so close and i don't understand why it is not working"
17931200,17934480," i don't understand why it is not working"
17934480,17937200," it's just like"
17937200,17941520," what if the screen's no it's not"
17941520,17954400," bp ap mbp ap what is wrong with this by the way having diff tools here doesn't work it's not helpful"
17956080,17964400," oh yeah let's go oh yeah let's go oh yeah"
17964400,17969120," uh so what if it's what if it's half of the pz"
17969120,17973040," are you"
17975680,17983680," okay okay so we're obviously kind of extending this thing all right so this one uh the more we"
17983680,17986000," multiply this thing okay"
17986000,17993040," all right so the uh what if i just do that"
17995200,18000480," what if i do four"
18000480,18007520," what if i do eight"
18007520,18018800," this pz is not big enough apparently"
18023120,18035600," and what is pz it's the distance"
18044880,18055760," it is not big enough apparently"
18055760,18057760," it is not big enough apparently"
18057760,18057760," um"
18057760,18065760," um"
18065760,18077280," interesting"
18077280,18081760," interesting this is actually interesting so"
18081760,18089360," that means this i was right this value is not correct it is just like not correct at all"
18091280,18091840," um"
18091840,18098720," fascinating right so we we found the tangent like the tangent of this thing and then"
18098720,18104080," we can kind of try to extend this entire stuff so"
18104080,18107760," i don't really know i don't really know"
18107760,18117440," so obviously i want to try to go through this logic one more time"
18119040,18122000," i'm going to try to go through this logic one more time"
18122000,18123680," uh like so"
18123680,18126240," right and"
18126240,18131200," all right so we have this sort of like distance"
18131200,18132320," right and"
18132320,18134640," we're trying to"
18134640,18137920," find some sort of a point in here right sure"
18137920,18141200," we're trying to find some sort of point in here"
18141760,18146400," this is alpha right so this is a which is the full height"
18146400,18149200," this is the full c and"
18149200,18155760," actually this is c and this is b b is like the full length in here up until this point and this point"
18155760,18157040," is what we're interested in"
18157040,18160880," right so this point is what we're interested in"
18161680,18169840," so and the tangent tangent tangent of alpha is the opposing one which is b over a right so that that"
18169840,18172240," makes sense that nobody will disagree with that"
18172240,18179520," but then if we take a look from the side we take a look at that from the side"
18184560,18190480," so take a look at that from the side we're usually like grabbing one of these sides in here and this"
18190480,18197200," side is p1 right so this side is p1 and this side is p2 so the distance from the player's position"
18197200,18201600," right so pp player's position and p1 is actually"
18203040,18212880," um this thing right you can say that it's a b prime so this distance in here uh can i just do that"
18212880,18222000," like this this distance in here is a b prime so p1 and pp right it's that distance in here"
18222000,18228480," pretty cool so a prime which is like a smaller you can actually kind of compute that very easily"
18228480,18234640," it's just like depends on the current distance in here right so it's just like pz"
18234640,18249520," um so and now if i do b prime over a prime i get tangent of this thing"
18249520,18255440," and essentially now i need to somehow multiply that by the full"
18257360,18263600," height in here by the full height in here and this is a and we decided the height is"
18263600,18273680," half of the screen but maybe what if it's a full screen well i mean we tried two that didn't help"
18273680,18279840," right so if i just do screen height that is not going to work yeah that is not going to work so"
18279840,18284720," what about two screen it's two screens it's two screens also doesn't work"
18284720,18295040," so yeah it has to be something like like around 10. it has to be like around 10"
18303600,18310800," and even then it is not fully correct wait it is kind of yeah so it's not aligned with the edges and"
18310800,18323200," it's not going to work so yeah so 10 is literally just aligned"
18323200,18328320," it is fully aligned actually perfectly why is it why is it 10"
18333760,18339680," can anybody explain me why is it 10"
18339680,18344400," far clipping plane uh far clipping plane"
18346160,18352480," is not really used that much anywhere if i change the far clipping plane to 12"
18352480,18359200," it is not changing anything yeah it's not it has nothing to do with the far clipping plane"
18360720,18367440," um so all right so we figured it out"
18367440,18372800," um screen factor is 10"
18372800,18379920," oh shit wait a fucking second screen factor"
18387200,18389520," and now screen factor is 20"
18389520,18399840," no but now look screen factor"
18399840,18413200," why 10 where is the fucking it's not a screen factor i just changed it"
18414400,18416960," where's the screen factor like 10 coming from"
18416960,18422560," far clipping plane doesn't matter i can put 20 in here"
18422560,18428480," one over near clipping maybe okay okay okay just a second"
18428480,18433280," right so i just want to put the resolution where it's bearable at least"
18433280,18436720," so i changed the uh clipping plane to to this"
18436720,18440800," uh did it actually refresh"
18442480,18445360," uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh okay so"
18445360,18452880," well i mean we probably can just define"
18452880,18458560," all right can anybody explain you why"
18458560,18469680," why do you have to divide this thing by the near clipping plane"
18472080,18480640," you cast to the plane not the screen maybe"
18480640,18487680," i mean we got it we got it i don't understand why"
18487680,18490880," like why do we divide it by this"
18490880,18498400," so that means like that means i don't understand but i'm glad that we figured it out nonetheless"
18499360,18505920," um normalizing that's why you divide by one valer i don't know what is a valer value i mean"
18505920,18511200," uh i don't know what's available it has something to do with the normalization yeah"
18511200,18515920," uh it has something to do with the normalization but that is"
18515920,18526400," it is bizarre anyway so just a second um can i now accept the floor value somewhere here so we're gonna"
18526400,18535200," just accept floor as the html image element um so and this is going to be the floor"
18536480,18553040," floor floor okay okay new new scene and this is going to be wall one all right so"
18553040,18561040," so uh yeah yeah okay so what you don't like in here"
18561040,18567360," this thing has to be html image elements all right so and"
18570320,18578080," it's not a sign but the parameter to html and uh well i mean whatever dude whatever so this has to"
18578080,18587120," be tiled then and this thing has to be tiled sure whatever and then in get floor we just always return"
18588000,18600160," this floor uh-huh so next fly check next ever okay next one next one so we don't even need this"
18600160,18608160," shit anymore i mean this one is not a thing anymore uh fly check next can i just ignore it somehow"
18608960,18627680," anyways um so render floor render floor um else um if tile instance of html image blah blah blah draw image"
18627680,18636480," we're drawing the tile right we're drawing the tile and then uh so what do we have in here x and y"
18638000,18645360," but it's actually yeah so we have to take the t and we have to floor it so this is going to be"
18645360,18652080," map math floor right so we do map math floor so it's called c or whatever doesn't matter"
18652080,18663280," cx multiplied by tile width cy multiplied by tile height we probably want to floor all of them math floor like so"
18664320,18672480," and then um is b prime is just one over clipping plane i don't know i don't think so actually"
18672480,18676080," though"
18676080,18678720," could be"
18678720,18684960," so clipping plane is just like a distance but at the same time"
18684960,18690240," i don't know i don't know what is going on honestly like i i'm trying to comprehend like what the"
18690240,18696400," what the fuck is going on but i can't because i'm too dumb for this shit okay so uh so this is the source"
18696400,18703280," and the destination is uh x y one one one yeah that's what i have"
18703280,18711200," uh x one y one one okay so does it compile it seems to be compiling so let's take a look at it"
18714080,18722880," okay bruh bruh bruh so it's not so when i do this thing i return like did it recompile or"
18722880,18729440," um i haven't like a cached phantom version yet again bruh"
18731360,18740000," please some cash please why don't you just return i don't fucking know is it like not rendering"
18740000,18741200," anything or am i"
18741200,18749840," okay so if i just return core color one are you going to be working"
18749840,18757200," yes you are working but then i return your floor are you working you are not working you don't want to"
18757200,18763360," use the floor so uh i pass the floor to okay new scene"
18763360,18770720," so i just do that do i not initialize the floor by the way no i do initialize the floor"
18770720,18782160," so instance of html image element right so it's it's html image elements um yeah and i just draw"
18784880,18792240," am i am i am i going crazy i feel like i'm going crazy so um first four parameters"
18792240,18795920," is the source on the image so here's the source on the image and then the destination"
18795920,18801520," and that should work um where did i make a mistake"
18808480,18810880," is it is it why don't you work bruh"
18810880,18815200," oh"
18815200,18820480," what the is going on honestly"
18820480,18835120," so get floor okay so it's good well i mean it should always return you the tile no matter what"
18835120,18837920," all right so just return the tile no matter what we pass the tile"
18837920,18845280," bruh like do i have to refresh everything completely like"
18845280,18849520," bruh what the"
18849520,18856320," okay maybe there is an error in the console like i don't see any error in here"
18857760,18866080," eastern egg from the engine where is the error where is the error like i literally don't see it"
18866080,18872640," it's it's the worst thing ever honestly because okay so here's that i pass the wall"
18872640,18878480," um maybe take just a fraction yeah probably probably something with the fractional part just a second"
18878480,18890800," i don't think a render floor um see no this is the ah for fucks okay um i'm already tired as you can see"
18890800,18896960," uh fractional part yeah so that that explains it explain okay"
18901280,18909200," well that kind of works so the um you probably want to actually load something like wood uh and we did"
18909200,18918240," have wood in assets uh we did have wood in assets and uh wolf tax by the way it's not very open game"
18918240,18930800," uh but whatever so we have mossy uh wood yeah assets uh let's put it this way uh what's that"
18930800,18936480," so it's gonna be const wood await"
18937280,18946320," load image data okay uh wood png and of course catch"
18946320,18959600," rgba purple something like this so this is wood uh and there we go please refresh please refresh"
18959600,18966400," motherfucker did i put the wood in here no i didn't okay all right so that seems to be"
18967280,18979600," okay no that's all right that's all right okay it's so fucking slow bruh"
18979600,18985920," yeah you know this is also because i'm streaming and shit"
18985920,18994400," all right so we can reduce the resolution of course let's actually say the factor is five"
18996400,19002720," the factor is five so it's much better now so but there's a little bit of a floor"
19002720,19011040," uh-huh and yeah we're kind of working we're kind of working so what if we increase the flv"
19011040,19017200," uh what if the flv is going to be much bigger uh 75"
19017920,19031920," that is yeah that was bad so let's not do that ever again um for clipping plane oh by the way so i"
19031920,19033600," actually need to bring it a little bit closer"
19035840,19040640," yeah yeah so and screen factor"
19040640,19049280," yeah screen factor please okay yeah for the textures it's a little bit too slow"
19049280,19059120," right for the textures it's a bit too slow so yeah but we figured it out we figured it out so let's go"
19059120,19061680," back to the get floor uh"
19061680,19073280," uh right when it was something different right so const t p map math floor right math math floor tx plus t y"
19073280,19078560," right so this is going to be uh mod equal zero"
19080000,19088400," all right all right and this is going to be color one and quarter that's what we're going to do refresh"
19088400,19095600," so with the colors it's a little bit easier all right with the textures it's a little bit harder"
19096560,19104640," um do we figure out why 10 because it's a a near clipping plane it's a inverse of a near clipping"
19104640,19110320," plane i still haven't figured out why exactly we have to do that uh but it is what it is it's actually"
19110320,19124240," kind of interesting near clipping plane um so yeah that is interesting on this line that is really"
19124240,19126000," interesting that we have to do like that"
19126000,19129840," yeah"
19129840,19135760," so if we arrange scales by near clipping plane that doesn't tell me anything"
19135760,19143280," it's baked in a favor range nothing of that tells me anything i need to understand the the"
19143280,19147440," logic of this entire stuff i need to go to the formulas like carefully and then i can say that i"
19147440,19153120," understand that um but it's kind of cool that we figured it out finally we have floor"
19154240,19166160," um so and yeah so it's obviously slow but that's fine we can make it faster later right and we can"
19166160,19171280," try to figure out different ways to make it faster like i think the easiest way would be to just like"
19171280,19175600," rewrite it and see and work on the level of individual pixels because right now we're doing something"
19175600,19179360," super stupid like for example drop image"
19179360,19189280," so yeah this is the stupidest thing i've ever like written because here we're just like cutting out a"
19189280,19195920," single pixel out of the image like we're using this image as a sprite just to put a single pixel this is"
19195920,19202560," like honestly dumb all of that should be done like on a level of like like a low level and shuffling"
19202560,19208560," bits and bytes and stuff like that and it should generate like a pixel map that then should be like"
19208560,19214080," swapped onto like blitzed onto the onto the canvas that's the right way to do that to make it fast"
19214080,19220880," so and maybe in one of the future episodes we're going to be actually rewriting this entire thing in c"
19221760,19225520," right so maybe we're going to be doing we're going to be rewriting all that stuff and see"
19225520,19231600," so for now by the way maybe i'm going to change the colors a little bit let me make them"
19231600,19237680," a little bit palatable right so what's the color of the bottom i think it's like"
19237680,19246880," something like 80 80 80 right and this one is let's say is going to be uh 30 30 30 something like that"
19246880,19254960," right so it's actually refresh and that was not enough apparently so what if i'm okay so what you"
19254960,19269760," don't like oh okay uh what's the what's the 80 by that's like uh yeah i'm doing so 24 okay uh new rgb"
19269760,19280160," though this one is yeah it's in terms of from zero to one so we have to do this stupid 0 94 0 94"
19280160,19290640," 0 0 94 and this is just one uh all right and this one is going to be what uh so what is it called"
19290640,19305440," so it was 30 so it's going to be 18 yeah uh okay so that's much better uh so yeah i don't want to keep"
19305440,19311440," it um you know red and blue because it's too harsh right i just want to keep it like that"
19313520,19318960," all right so until we actually make it faster so with the colors it works fast as you can see with"
19318960,19325280," colors it works fast uh as soon as you introduce texture it's become slower right so until i make"
19325280,19333760," this entire thing faster i don't think it makes sense to uh to keep textures anyways uh no so here we're"
19333760,19342720," doing wood stuff let me get rid of the wood maybe i'm gonna get rid of the scene completely here"
19343520,19348320," i mean the floor yeah that's what i was trying to say"
19348320,19357280," so no floor in here and where is the wooden here okay so everything seems to be compiling"
19357280,19367360," all right everything seems to be that so floor cannot be what was the line 97 97 yeah is everything okay"
19368640,19373600," uh 95 95 all right everything seems to be okay"
19373600,19386400," so there was some if false i think i removed the if false parts so this is that this is that"
19387920,19394560," uh yeah i just renamed it for for whatever reason okay"
19394560,19403200," cool implement rudimentary floor rendering"
19403200,19417760," okay so it took me three days to do that all right um and i still do not fully"
19417760,19422080," understand how i did that exactly right i still don't understand that part of"
19422080,19427760," near clipping plane like dividing by near clipping plane but i'm glad that i have at least something"
19427760,19435200," working so that means we can actually start iterating from here uh i mean to be first 30 meters for ceiling"
19435200,19441280," let's go um ceiling is basically that you just like put it upside down right so it's it's literally the"
19441280,19447920," the same thing um so it shouldn't be that hard famous last words right so"
19447920,19452960," shouldn't be that hard so but i mean whatever um"
19452960,19461760," yeah i can try to do that it's it should be literally the same thing honestly i mean why is"
19461760,19468720," it not just rendering floor just take the same and call it rendering ceiling and just iterate"
19468720,19475920," it differently okay so ceiling um all right so now we're iterating from half up until that but now"
19475920,19483280," we're iterating from zero uh up until uh half of that so that's what we do now aren't we"
19484560,19490080," i'm pretty sure that's what we're doing now and uh essentially instead of get floor let's get ceiling"
19490080,19494640," get ceiling um"
19497200,19504240," okay i mean i mean it's it's not available get floor uh okay so"
19504240,19507200," ceiling"
19507200,19514400," okay so we can actually call this um you know clear place color"
19514400,19521840," floor one i said floor one oh no sorry i'm a little bit tired already"
19524320,19531120," and this one is going to be essentially color two color two all right so floor two"
19531120,19535760," and let's introduce like a ceiling colors silly colors"
19535760,19547600," ceiling ceiling colors so this one is going to be a ceiling um rgba red let's actually make it bright"
19548560,19556800," ceiling one one so we can actually instantly seal on that uh rgba blue let it go so that's what we have"
19556800,19567360," you yeah a ceiling too okay uh-huh uh-huh so in here as to the floor we're doing uh ceiling"
19569200,19582000," so get ceiling uh get ceiling all right so yeah why is it not that okay so this kind of stuff like"
19582000,19587840," differences could okay okay i see why this could be a problem i see why this could be a problem"
19587840,19593360," but not that much honestly you just do um"
19596560,19604080," okay okay okay so let's give it a try and see how it fails uh render floor uh and render ceiling"
19604080,19607840," okay let's do"
19607840,19622000," uh something crashed apparently uh render ceiling is not defined really okay so i think yes i think it's not"
19622000,19625680," it's not going to just work and it's not going to just work and it just worked"
19625680,19634640," that's a very sus sky but i mean it's just like moving in a different direction yeah that's"
19634640,19635360," understandable"
19635360,19645440," so we can actually disable floor right so and maybe even it actually looks kind of cool honestly it kind"
19645440,19646000," kind of looks cool"
19646000,19655680," so i'm moving yeah so if we enable both of them if we enable both of them"
19660000,19662320," yeah they're moving in the opposite direction"
19662320,19672240," walls i need the walls damn that actually kind of looks cool"
19672240,19681360," okay another three days to implement the the floor yes i agree with that"
19682960,19691120," another three days to implement the floor um so what if we um"
19691120,19702640," i don't know just invert the whole thing um right so if i just do render ceiling"
19705440,19714000," so we'll just do that but uh uh let's just invert the coordinates so this is that"
19714000,19717760," uh so this is one"
19717760,19721520," so here is this"
19725520,19735200," first time"
19735200,19744080," first try first try first try first try haters gonna hate haters gonna hate"
19744080,19747600," yeah bro"
19749520,19753280," that was easier than expected it's it's literally floor but you just like inverted"
19753280,19757920," um so it's literally floor but you just inverted"
19757920,19767600," okay so now we have a ceiling so now we can even like do things like we can have scenes like inside"
19767600,19777760," of the dungeon or something uh which is kind of cool right i really like that all right um so"
19779520,19794800," that's pretty cool okay so maybe eventually this thing will turn into like a web game and that's kind"
19794800,19801920," of my goal right so i want you to make a game out of this entire thing that's pretty cool"
19801920,19807760," so maybe eventually this thing will turn into like a web game and that's kind of my goal right so i want"
19807760,19813680," you to make a game out of this entire thing uh right so and we already have like a rudimentary engine"
19813680,19819840," i would really like to improve its performance because right now performance is uh right now the"
19819840,19826160," performance is okay so what's going to be the next plans uh i think i'm going to take the the past three"
19826160,19831120," days and i'm going to try to edit them a little bit and can continue into a single episode that i'm"
19831120,19835920," going to upload it to youtube it's going to be a huge episode but i kind of want to tell the whole story"
19835920,19842000," because i think the story of figuring out how to render floor and ceiling is kind of interesting"
19842000,19846080," even though it's kind of long because if you go through all of these three days there was a lot of"
19846080,19851840," interesting things here right so we tried different hypotheses and stuff like that so i think it's worth"
19851840,19857840," like preserving the entire the entire story of this of implementing this feature what's funny is that is"
19858480,19863280," um like i don't even fully understand this implementation again i still don't understand"
19863280,19868640," division by a near clipping plane this is something that i'll have to sit down and figure out"
19868640,19872320," by my own right so maybe in the next episode i'm going to explain how to do that"
19873040,19880640," uh so uh but your cpu will always be hot while you play this game it my cpu is always hot even if i'm"
19880640,19887120," not playing this game that's the thing so i close this game and my cpu is still at 100 this is because i'm"
19887120,19893440," also streaming so i have a very old laptop uh right where from which i'm also streaming and i'm doing this"
19893440,19900400," kind of stuff uh actually the game when i'm not streaming works way faster like magnitudes actually faster so"
19900400,19906800," whatever the performance i have in here is not even representable of the game um so yeah so which is kind"
19906800,19911760," of useful for developing like um you know high performance applications right because you're kind of"
19911760,19919600," forced to write them you know fast um so and after we rewrite this entire thing in c i think it's going to be"
19919600,19928000," even faster right so uh my plan is to actually just like take the olive c approach uh let's take a look at it"
19929840,19939120," uh this one so here is the 3d but this is the 3d that we render pixel by pixel in web assembly so and"
19939120,19944480," also this stuff so you can actually find it here it's not webgl or anything and it's when i'm also"
19944480,19952160," streaming right so i'm super proud of this uh this thing actually um i'm super proud of these things"
19952160,19957760," and i'm pretty sure we can actually rewrite that engine in a similar style right but that's going to be"
19957760,19965280," already the um the next episode all right that's it for today thanks everyone who's watching right"
19965280,19970560," now i really appreciate it have a good one and see you on the next recreation programming session"
19970560,19979680," all right this is the footnote of the session and i think i figured out why we have to divide the whole"
19979680,19985840," thing by uh nearest clipping plane so let's take a look at the uh way we render the walls to render the"
19985840,19991920," walls we have a pretty interesting method of player which is called fov range which returns you two points"
19991920,19999760," p1 and p2 as you can see so what those points mean uh okay let's this thing be a position of the player p"
19999760,20005040," so on top of the position player also has the direction uh where it's looking currently right"
20005040,20013280," so and how we calculate p1 and p2 p1 and p2 are essentially the wings of flb cone right field of"
20013280,20021440," view cone so we basically move this vector forward towards the distance of uh nearest clipping plane"
20021440,20028400," right so you can kind of say that this is npc nearest clipping plane so and then we render this nearest"
20028400,20036960," clipping plane and we extend these two things in here uh and this one is p1 and this one is p2 pretty"
20036960,20043680," simple right and then uh we interpolate from p1 to p2 and we're basically shooting rates and just sitting"
20043680,20049920," where they're uh and just seeing where they hit and if they hit something we render the uh the pixels"
20049920,20057600," accordingly and stuff like that so to render floor we actually have to look at the uh the entire fov cone"
20057600,20065600," from the side so let's quickly do that so uh here is p right so and p is at the level of the height"
20065600,20070800," of the player and stuff like that and here's the projection plane also known as a near scoping plane"
20070800,20075040," we're using these two terms interchangeably doesn't really matter so essentially let's imagine that"
20075040,20081200," we want to render this specific pixel to render this specific pixel uh what we have to do"
20081200,20086800," we have to shoot array from the position of the player from the position of the eyes of the player"
20086800,20093680," through that pixel towards the floor and see uh where it hits the floor and as soon as we hit"
20093680,20098240," it hits the floor we know the coordinates of the tile from which we can figure out the color of the"
20098240,20104640," pixel and so on and so forth right so let's actually denote the sides of this sort of triangle that we"
20104640,20111040," have on here so a b and hypotenuse is the c so we know a right because that's the height of the player"
20111040,20117760," that's pretty simple and we need to know b but we don't really know it so but what we can know we can"
20117760,20124320," actually know a smaller b which is like a distance from the player towards the screen and let's call"
20124320,20130960," it something like b prime and we can also know sort of like a smaller version of a which is a prime so by"
20130960,20138880," dividing b uh by a prime we kind of find the tangent of this alpha which enables us to scale this smaller"
20138880,20146720," triangle to a bigger one by multiplying by full a right so this sort of like a fraction allows us to"
20146720,20152080," scale this smaller triangle to a bigger one and that's how we find the full b and that's how we find"
20152080,20158000," where to look for the pixels and stuff like that so b prime is essentially the distance from p to p1"
20158000,20163920," uh nothing particularly special so there's something interesting about how we compute fov cone when we're"
20163920,20173520," looking top down so the angle of fov does not care about this specific distance so essentially if we put"
20173520,20181200," uh the projection plane a little bit further uh this angle will stay the same because we just extend"
20181200,20191840," these swings of fov cone and now this is p1 and p2 so nothing really changed but if you put the um"
20191840,20198480," clipping plane further while looking from the side while rendering the floor look what is going to happen"
20198480,20204480," let's imagine that now the clipping plane is a little bit further and uh so the pixel that we're trying to"
20204480,20210480," render is actually located in here so if you shoot array from that pixel you're looking at a completely"
20210480,20217120," different pixel on the floor and in fact you are working with a completely different small rectangle"
20217120,20223440," so and look at that you extended the size of b prime but the size of a prime stayed the same"
20224880,20232560," so to accommodate for the change of b prime you also need to change a prime or essentially"
20232560,20239920," multiplied by the same amount b prime is extended which is nearest clipping plane uh nearest clipping"
20239920,20248560," plane ncp i call it npc so it's supposed to be ncp brain damage from the memes i'm sorry uh so and"
20248560,20256400," essentially what we were doing we're not dividing by ncp we were extending the size of a prime uh"
20256400,20263200," proportionally to the change of the size of b prime that's what we were doing so i think that's how it"
20263200,20269120," works essentially like at the time i was working out the math it was not obvious to me but once i tried"
20269120,20277360," to implement that i figured out right so around and you'll find out so yeah uh i hope this entire"
20277360,20282560," three-day session was interesting um so i don't know how many people this kind of stuff is interesting"
20282560,20288160," but if you watched until this point thank you for being interested in this kind of nerdy so yeah i"
20288160,20294240," really appreciate you uh so yeah thanks everyone for watching and i see you on the next recreational"
20294240,20299040," programming session with mr azuzin i love you"
