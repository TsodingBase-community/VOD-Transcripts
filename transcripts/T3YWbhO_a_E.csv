160,5600," hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session with a mr"
5600,11280," azuzin so uh we're going to continue working on panim which is a programming animation engine that"
11280,16080," allows you to develop this kind of animation so look at that is it not poggers that's pretty"
16080,20960," freaking poggers i think right so i'm going to be using that for making a video and stuff like that"
20960,27920," so uh but but but but uh so i working was working on this animation it's actually pretty cool"
27920,34560," animation i'm super proud of it but there is a little bit of a problem uh with this specific"
34560,39760," uh like with how this specific animation work so essentially what i'm trying to do i'm trying to"
39760,45360," simulate how a turing machine sort of like executes its instructions and stuff like that like how it"
45360,50720," executes them right as you can see like every time it performs one of these actions right so because"
50720,58560," here we have like what you have to do if you are in a state ink and reading this symbol right so let's"
58560,66160," actually start over uh right so there we go so as you can see you are in a state ink and here is a state"
66160,72960," ink and you're reading one and here is one what you have to do you have to write zero move to the right"
72960,78560," and switch to the state ink and since you are still in the state ink it's not going to switch anything so"
78560,84000," essentially what i want to do every time it performs one of these side effects i want them"
84000,90000," to sort of pop up right so to indicate that i'm performing them and i want to perform them simultaneously"
90000,96000," as i perform them actually so let's actually slow down the entire animation a little bit so as you can"
96000,103360," see it starts to uh sort of enlarge and also it starts to do this kind of thing simultaneously with like"
103360,110080," as i switch the whole thing right look at that so look at both of these things right and then as you"
110080,116080," can see it starts to move to the right and as it moves to the right i enlarge this thing right so and"
116080,123680," then it switches this thing again and then moves to the right and so on and so forth right so until it"
123680,129760," reaches the situation when it's ink zero in that case as you can see we switch to this sort of state"
129760,138560," or we switch to one we then move to the left and we are switching to the whole state right so we're"
138560,143040," switching to the whole state as you can see here is the whole state and this is where the problem is"
143040,150240," it kind of looks derpy doesn't it right so when these things playing and changing and these things so"
150240,157680," popping up they feel a little bit out of sync they kind of feel a little bit out of sync so let's actually"
157680,161360," play it one more time and you will see what i mean here look at that"
161360,169200," especially when we switch to the whole right it kind of feels a little bit weird so they're sort"
169200,179520," of like out of sync so essentially um what i want to do uh i want maybe to when i switch this state"
180080,189200," to also enlarge this thing to the size of this thing so then when they settle back to the original size"
189200,197280," they do that simultaneously they do that simultaneously so and what's interesting is that to do this kind of"
197280,203680," animations i'm using different interpolation functions right i'm using different interpolation functions and"
203680,210720," stuff like that so let's actually go to my paint and i'm going to demonstrate what i mean right um so"
210720,215840," okay my paint is starting so maybe i should actually stop running because it's a little bit heavy on"
215840,220640," resources sometimes when especially when i have a lot of things so let's actually look at the uh"
220640,228080," coordinate axis right so we have some sort of a coordinate axis like this and i have the x t so we're"
228080,234720," going to denote that as a time and then we have a function f of t so i usually usually consider the"
234720,243120," function from zero to one right from zero to one uh right so if you take a look at uh maybe a function"
243120,251040," that looks like this f of uh t uh equal to t right so this is basically an id and it looks like this sort of"
251040,261920," line um right so essentially if i use this function to animate uh like transitions of for example moving"
261920,269840," of one object to another one it will look kind of robotic right it will look kind of robotic so uh instead"
269840,277840," what i do instead i actually use a slightly different function uh i use smooth step that i think i think it"
277840,285200," roughly looks like this right so not exactly but roughly actually let's actually use smoothing"
285200,293840," uh in my paint yeah there we go almost right it's something like this right so as you can see it starts"
293840,300960," up slow then in the middle it ramps up and then it slows down again right it slows down again and it"
300960,307280," creates this sort of like a cool effect when there are transitions and stuff like that so we also had"
307280,314560," sign step so smooth step is actually if i'm not mistaken so let's actually do so this is a smooth step"
314560,325840," uh it's too too long to type smooth smooth step right so it takes t and its formula it's hardcoded"
325840,332320," somewhere in the source code let me actually see if i switch to the correct layout um right so we have"
332320,342560," a smooth step it's it's three multiplied by t squared right uh three multiplied by t squared minus two t cube"
342560,351760," that's what it is i also have a sine step right which basically takes uh a part of the sine wave that looks"
351760,357520," like this like a half of the sine wave as well uh right and stuff like that so this is basically different"
357520,363120," functions that i used to make the animation smoother and stuff like that but to synchronize"
363120,371760," this sort of like uh motions to to make more complex things uh i need a function that roughly"
371760,382240," looks like this right so essentially i need to sort of go uh yeah maybe i'm gonna go like this then i have to"
382240,390560," overshoot a little bit in here right so overshoot a little bit in here and then maybe go back right so"
390560,396720," because the symbols in the table they're slightly smaller than the symbols on the tape so to synchronize"
396720,402960," them in sort of the size and then settle down into sort of like the same size i need to look over shoot"
402960,410400," over one a little bit and how do i even define this kind of this kind of function and on top of that okay"
410400,416560," so that's a really funny function but i also want to be able to define arbitrary functions in here like"
416560,423360," you know like in the vector editor right like in a vector editor and this is where"
424160,430480," i think the time has come to introduce bezier curves are you guys familiar with bezier curves"
430480,439280," uh let's take a look at them uh i think my app okay so my mouse almost dead so here are the things"
439280,449200," so essentially um bezier curves you probably saw bezier curves in uh vector editors right as already"
449200,453600," dimensions so i've already have that in description so let's take a look at inkscape right so let's open"
453600,459280," up the inkscape so some people do know them pretty well that's actually cool that's actually cool so"
459280,463200," let's actually create a new document let's actually create a new document"
466640,475280," um yes why is it bright again every time i open this thing it's always bright even though i explicitly"
475280,482880," say bra don't make it so bright uh right so this is going to be the desk yeah that that's what i'm"
482880,489520," freaking talking about and this one uh yeah let's actually make it maybe something like this i wonder"
489520,496720," if i can save this entire thing probably not right uh so anyways so essentially you can uh create this"
496720,503280," kind of thing right so which is the basically simple stroke let's make the stroke a little bit thicker"
503280,509360," so we can at least see it and let's make it white right so again so we can at least see it"
509360,518480," so and what these kind of things allow you to do it allows you to have this sort of like handles"
518480,526480," right that you can control and have smooth curves like this right so it would be kind of cool if"
526480,532960," this was like basically uh how i have this axis right so this is basically t and this is basically"
532960,539360," f of t and i could like control how exactly those things look like right so for instance i could do"
539360,546000," exactly the shape of the function that i want that would have been cool right infinite smoothness yeah"
546000,550320," actually i think they are infinitely smooth essentially right so because it's a mathematical"
550320,556000," curve right so it basically depends on the resolution that you're rendering it with right"
556000,561120," if you're going to be rendering it right you you have to kind of pick this step pick the resolution"
561120,566800," uh right and then you can just smooth it so and with definitely infinite resolution is going to have be"
566800,575360," like infinitely um infinitely smooth so how can you even uh render this kind of uh this kind of bizarre"
575360,581840," curve right so there are some animations on the internet that actually tell you how to do that"
581840,587760," there is a lot of as you can see formulas scary mathematical formulas but this is because it's wikipedia"
587760,595360," right this is because it's wikipedia honestly throughout my career and like i noticed that"
595360,602720," a lot of mathematical and programming ideas are actually very fucking simple they're actually like"
602720,608480," i haven't like seen like a mathematical idea that you couldn't just easily understand if you spend some"
608480,615600," time and a lot of this is literally gatekeeping bullshit like majority of them and then the more"
615600,620400," i do this kind of stuff the more i'm getting convinced that yeah that's basically literally"
620400,627040," people trying to gate keep like and it's kind of like difficult to now convince me otherwise because"
627040,633600," i've seen it so many freaking times people just use that as a means to yeah so this is basically a good"
633600,638640," example on how they're rendered essentially right so this is a very good example but as far as now this"
638640,645920," is a quadratic bezier curve right so essentially you have two lines right and you interpolating between"
645920,650880," these two lines right and then you interpolate between the third line this is a cubic one and this"
650880,658000," is probably the one that we will need right so the more the main sort of like operation to that we will need"
658000,668000," to render um uh the bezier curve is going to be lerp or a linear interpolation uh right so let me actually"
668000,674240," pick maybe some sort of a bluish color and this is a very important operation honestly i think this is"
674240,682720," like an extremely important operation it accepts three parameters a b and c and t usually usually you"
682720,689120," like between zero like between zero and one right so that's what it is it can actually go over uh zero and"
689120,695760," one so but like usually you want it to be like between zero and one and so what it does it basically"
695760,705280," interpolates between a and b right so essentially you can think about it this way the closer t to zero"
706160,714000," the closer the result of lerp is going to be to a the closer t to one the closer the result of the"
714000,724240," lerp is going to be to b right so a corresponds to zero b corresponds to one right so and of course"
724240,731360," you can uh go under zero and over one and in that case the result is going to be under a and over b but"
731360,737200," usually this is not really what you want right usually this is not what you want so since it's"
737200,741600," basically interpolating between these two ways the implementation is going to be basically you need"
741600,747200," to take the distance between a and b so you're going to take b a so this is the distance and you multiply"
747200,753440," it by t so that means that sort of length is going to be interpolating from zero to the full distance"
753440,758720," as t goes from zero to one and then you're just upset by a so this is the entirety of the operation"
759440,765440," right this is the entirety of the operation so in here i'm using a b as scalars but they can be vectors"
765440,772480," they could be points in the space right so this could be a and b right so and essentially if t is"
772480,777920," going to be zero that means we're talking about this point if it's one we're talking about this point if"
777920,789120," it's half you you will find this point right so this is basically lerp a b 0.5"
789120,796080," you get the point right so the closer you are to zero the closer you're going to be to a the closer"
796080,802080," you are to one the closer you're going to be to b that's the entire to learn that's the entire to learn"
802080,814320," so now if you take three points right a b and c and you connect them like this"
814320,824400," right you connect them like this so you have two lines in here so now you have t and let's imagine that"
824400,834320," you start modifying iterating over that t from zero to one with some certain step with some certain"
834320,840720," step right essentially uh right so maybe zero zero point one zero point two and so on and so forth it"
840720,847840," doesn't really matter you're iterating from uh from zero to one so then let's imagine that t is somewhere"
847840,856080," in the middle you take a lerp between a and b right and you find the point this is another point then you"
856080,863280," take the point between b and c for that current t and this is the second point right then you connect"
863280,872720," these two points and you get the third line then you take do a lerp between this point and this point"
872720,883600," with the same t and you get the point on bezier curve for that specific t right and this is what's"
883600,890880," happening in that animations on the internet that you can see in here so the more lines you have the more"
890880,898720," lines you have well this is the quadratic one right if you do this nested lerping you see we have a hati"
898720,904960," and stuff like that if you do this nest in lerping you're gonna end up with a smooth curve you're gonna"
904960,911520," end up with a smooth curve so the more points you have you can do that with like for example uh four"
911520,918160," points like this in here right the more sort of control over the curve you have the more control over"
918160,926800," the curve you have so usually the uh bizarre curves that we use in the vector software they are cubic"
926800,934800," ones so essentially you have four points uh here is the one first point here is the uh second point"
934800,942240," the third point and the fourth point so usually we don't draw the line between this point in this point"
943120,948480," right but it's kind of there there is kind of like this um another line in here but we don't draw it"
948480,954160," we just draw these things as these sort of handles that you can move around right so in under the hood"
954160,960080," inkscape is doing that algorithm maybe not that algorithm maybe something more smarter but in in the"
960080,969360," essence it's doing that right in the essence it's doing that so essentially uh what i want to do i want to"
969360,979120," implement the system that allows me to use busy curves busy curves for uh for the animations right so"
979120,987680," essentially uh we have a task system which defines small predefined amount of work right for example we"
987680,995680," have things like move scalar uh right so move scalar so for the move scalar you provide the pointer for the"
995680,1002560," scalar for the number for the value that you want to move from one uh position to another uh right you"
1002560,1010560," provide the target where you want to move that current value you provide duration like in for how long"
1010560,1016560," you're going to be moving from its current position to the target right and then you provide interpolation"
1016560,1023200," function then you provide interpolation function right so in essentially interpolation function what is it"
1023200,1027760," it's uh it's a enumeration uh which tells what kind of interpolation function you can use a sin step"
1027760,1034240," smooth step i also have sin pulse which goes back to to zero right it goes from zero to one and then back so"
1034240,1040480," you can do sort of pulses like that um right which can we need some time for for for these kinds of things"
1040480,1047040," so essentially i want to modify this entire thing to accept a busy a custom busy curve"
1047840,1056160," a custom busy curve right but busy curve actually has a lot of freedom but we need specifically a"
1056160,1064240," busy curve which defines a function from zero to one right it must define a function from zero to one"
1064240,1071760," so because of that there will be a little bit of a limitation on how we represent that busy a curve"
1071760,1078160," that is going to be used in the animations right so for instance uh we're going to be moving from zero to"
1078160,1086960," one so that means the first and the last point that define the busy curve uh is going to be snapped to the"
1086960,1093600," left side and the right one is going to be snapped to to the right side to one right we should be probably"
1093600,1101680," able to modify their y position right so move up and down but generally i don't want these control points"
1101680,1107360," to move left and right right because that doesn't make any sense i want like a function that is defined"
1107360,1115600," from zero to one preferably so because of that uh we kind of like don't want to move these things around"
1116480,1123600," so and then you also have to specify two other control points in here right so which is going to"
1123600,1129040," be obviously connected like that and then uh they're going to be interpolated like that right like so and"
1129040,1133520," then created the the actual curve and stuff like that right so there's probably also going to be some"
1133520,1143440," limitations on where we put those things maybe uh the how to say that the x the x of that point should"
1143440,1151920," always be less or equal to the x of that one uh or something like that um so yeah we'll need to think"
1151920,1156480," about that but maybe generally we want to provide just like four points to define this kind of thing"
1156480,1163920," um right and just use that for animation but here is an interesting thing this entire"
1164560,1175440," scheisse uh right this entire scheisse is um not convenient to edit right so this entire scheisse is"
1175440,1181200," not convenient to edit because uh like am i am i going to be modifying the points like directly"
1181200,1185920," uh right like in the code like numbers and stuff like that it would be kind of nice to have some sort"
1185920,1192960," of editors that looks like inkscape where i could just drag around just like jerk off these little red things"
1192960,1198560," uh to to my liking you know what i'm talking about i wanted to like jerk off these things like and then"
1198560,1205520," adjust and stuff like that so we need some sort of a freaking editor for this stuff and yeah that's"
1205520,1214240," going to be the point of today's stream let's freaking implement an editor for the freaking busier curves so"
1214240,1223680," we can use them in animation the park isn't that fucking cool mate it's not fucking cool right so yeah"
1223680,1228240," that's basically the the topic for today's stream we're going to be implementing this kind of thing"
1228240,1235520," and the editor will generate the basically the parameters of the busier curve that you will be able"
1235520,1242000," to then use uh in the functions you you'll be able to copy paste those things into uh into your code and"
1242000,1247840," stuff like that right so the idea is going to be maybe the busier curve editor is going to be"
1247840,1254800," one of the panim animations because the panim animations can interact right so it's usually"
1254800,1263280," like kind of discouraged but they can use uh right so they can use the input methods of raylib we can"
1263280,1271440," utilize that we can implement the busy curve editor as the panim animation and then we can ask that"
1271440,1281440," animation copy the busy curve parameters to the clipboard so then you can control v into your"
1281440,1288800," animation isn't that cool right so you're like adjusting this kind of stuff uh right and maybe"
1288800,1295440," busy curve parameters are going to be like array of floats right so um you know the actual busy thing is"
1295440,1302240," going to be basically like a float you know ps or whatever right and then you're going to do uh"
1302240,1308400," basically there's there's going to be a special button uh which you click and it copy paste into"
1308400,1315840," your clipboard things like uh like this uh 13 14 blah blah blah blah blah blah all of the parameters and"
1315840,1323840," also it formats it as a c code right so it not just gives you parameters in a clipboard it formats it as"
1323840,1331040," a c code that you can then control v right into your animation code so it just like generates c codes and"
1331040,1338720," puts it into the clipboard so you can copy paste it into your into your stuff how about that isn't that epic"
1338720,1352480," ux this is literally god ux the god ux 2 that generates c code puts that c code into your clipboard so you can"
1352480,1359520," copy paste it into into into into your project this is literally god ux this is this will"
1359520,1362400," revolutionize software development i'm fucking"
1362400,1372560," anyways uh maybe we could i don't know it would be kind of cool to have some sort of like a text"
1372560,1380400," editor extension that uh detects these kind of things oh this is a definition of bezier curve"
1380400,1386800," you click on that definition it creates a separate program where it opens up the bezier curve editor"
1386800,1392400," with these parameters you can edit them then you close it and it saves it back into this kind of"
1392400,1397680," parameters but we're probably not going to go into that but that's kind of cool idea right so in the"
1397680,1403520," code like directly uh you just click on the array oh it's a bezier curve let's edit that as a busy"
1403520,1410000," curve like temple os right you know so you can have a code and in the code itself you can also have"
1410000,1415520," sprites like built into the source code of the program and you can like draw them directly and"
1415520,1420960," shut like that isn't that fucking bogus my new friend holy shit cheers for that"
1420960,1429680," so yeah i'm too excited for this kind of i'm sorry so yeah that's basically what i wanted to do"
1429680,1434800," today right so i wanted to implement like a simple bezier curve editor and i think i already did this kind of"
1434800,1440080," shit before in one of my previous projects but i don't know where it is so it's probably somewhere"
1440080,1448000," on github uh so yeah anyway let's close all the shit and maybe start maybe a fort haha let's do fort"
1448880,1457360," uh so let's go i'm gonna try to rebuild uh okay everything is already rebuilt so i have a template"
1457360,1466880," animation template.c uh so and i'm pretty sure it's already built if i do build leap template uh and"
1466880,1472080," run this entire thing i'm not supposed to actually put in presenting here there we go so here is the template"
1472720,1477280," so what we probably want to do we probably want to copy paste this entire thing and let's actually call"
1477280,1487440," it bezier bezier.c all right so i'm going to open knob.c and i'm going to include bezier into the build"
1487440,1494080," uh bezier uh like so so let's actually do something like it doesn't oh okay bezier"
1494080,1507280," all right so uh let's go so this is going to be no and uh build panin build lip bezier"
1507280,1512320," there we go so panin template so i'm going to open the bezier"
1512880,1518960," uh bezier and let's change it to maybe uh bezier"
1518960,1524720," can i actually put like a ampersand in here or something not ampersand but you know"
1524720,1528480," diacritics and stuff like that are they called diacritic in french language i don't really know"
1528480,1532880," right so but this is this kind of things accents sort of like accents is it going to"
1537680,1544240," um thank you rayson very cool i'm pretty sure there is a way to enable that all right so yeah"
1544240,1550480," yeah you you have to do draw code points yeah you probably have to do draw code points uh right so i"
1550480,1557680," don't really care about it right now so okay um let's maybe get rid of all of that and uh we probably"
1557680,1563360," want to actually start with creating a camera right so let's actually start with creating a camera"
1563360,1569200," uh because with the camera it's a little bit easier to center things around uh because of that you know"
1569200,1576160," what uh let's bring this stuff back right so i'm going to create a camera 2d uh camera we're going"
1576160,1583040," to zero initialize this entire stuff and we're probably going to begin mode 2d right begin mode 2d"
1583040,1591920," camera uh like so uh let's maybe even wrap everything into the scope so we can indent this entire shit uh"
1591920,1598480," like so like so if i try to rebuild this entire thing and reload it we can't see shit in this mist"
1598480,1605680," and you know why because uh the zoom in the camera camera actually has the zoom it must be one otherwise"
1605680,1610000," it's going to be zero so it's going to be like actually infinitely small right and you won't be able to"
1610000,1616240," see shit uh there we go and now we can see all of that right so it points at the center right so that"
1616240,1622000," means this is zero zero and it points precisely at the center but not really actually because we're"
1622000,1628240," aligning this entire thing a little bit right so we do like a position alignment and stuff like that"
1628240,1634560," honestly we should probably not do any position alignment right so otherwise we won't be able to see"
1634560,1640080," if the camera is working correctly maybe i should include the camera into into the template right"
1640080,1649360," because it automatically makes everything easier yeah there we go so we need to now um center or upset"
1649360,1656560," this entire thing by the half of the screen size sort of speak so and i think in tm we already kind of"
1656560,1662720," have this kind of stuff yeah there we go uh so we have upset and upset is basically half of the screen"
1662720,1668560," width and half of the screen height okay so let's actually put this kind of stuff and uh rebuild this"
1668560,1673520," entire thing so it doesn't like the comma and stuff like that so let's actually do like that and it's"
1673520,1677920," kind of aligned but the whole thing in here is not aligned but it doesn't really matter we don't care"
1677920,1687760," about that uh okay good so yesu yesu yesu so now we have to actually render something right so we have"
1687760,1693840," to render the axis uh so to render the axis we probably have to use the draw line thing here right"
1693840,1701920," so some sort of a draw line thing um so where do we have a draw line let's go into ray deep and let's find"
1701920,1710480," the function draw uh line yeah so i want to be able to specify the thickness right i think specifying"
1710480,1716960," being able to specify the thickness is actually very beneficial for us um right so the thickness"
1716960,1725120," let's say uh like axis thickness right so axis thickness and for now it's going to be defined as"
1725120,1729280," this i'm going to move it to pre-process soon right so but for now it's going to be something like this"
1729280,1734320," so it's going to be five maybe uh five pixels right so then we're going to have a color which"
1734320,1740320," is axis color and what's going to be that color i want to kind of use blue for now right so this is"
1740320,1747920," going to be blue uh axis color there we go so we have to specify the position so let's say that the"
1747920,1755440," start position start position is going to be zero zero right so this is going to be zero zero uh we're starting"
1755440,1764240," at zero and the end position is going to be probably um so it's going to go up right let's define first"
1764240,1770560," y axis so that means this is going to be zero and this is going to be sort of like the length we need"
1770560,1779040," to specify something like axis length and let's define it like this axis length is going to be let's say maybe"
1779840,1785520," 100 right so we can always adjust this entire stuff we can always adjust this entire stuff so this is"
1785520,1791360," going to be essentially start position and this is going to be the start end right end position"
1791360,1798720," uh right so this is the end position so let's go ahead recompile this entire stuff and see if it works"
1798720,1807120," look at that so it goes down apparently i see so let's make it negative i suppose right so"
1807120,1814320," there we go it goes up but it's too small let's actually make it like maybe 500"
1814320,1820880," or something like that it's too no it's not too much actually look at that yeah it's fine that's that's"
1820880,1830080," fine right so and now we can actually draw the second one we can probably inline all of this stuff"
1830080,1835840," with a little bit of a clitoral if you know what i'm talking about you can always just you know inline"
1835840,1843680," that with a clitoral uh so let's put it like that so it's a single statement working with a single"
1843680,1850000," statement i think is a little bit easier than just three statements uh right so we have to put"
1850000,1856160," parentheses in here to indicate that this is in fact a clitoral okay so that is in fact a clitoral so now"
1856160,1862480," i can create a second statement and in here i can just move the axis length to the right"
1862480,1869280," uh and there you go right so we have the second axis like this right that's what we have"
1870240,1877360," all right so um it would be kind of nice to actually align uh this looks like by the way"
1877360,1882080," like what the is this absolutely disgusting so i think we have to maybe"
1882080,1890560," in terms of like x and y we have to subtract like half of the half of the height or something"
1890560,1896720," we'll see we'll see let's just keep it as it is let's just keep it as this so i want to align the view"
1896720,1901600," at the center of this thing i want to align the view at the center of this thing because of that i think"
1901600,1911520," we have to specify the offset plus the axis length and half of the axis length uh right and plus this"
1911520,1916000," so that means these parameters should be visible for the camera definition right so we're actually"
1916000,1922640," promoting them in here uh right so now if i go here it's actually went a little bit um you know"
1923360,1929200," sideways so let's actually try to subtract this entire thing uh okay so this thing seems to be"
1929200,1936240," centered properly but what about the uh the y axis right so is it fine now the the previously it was"
1936240,1940400," actually better previously it was actually better so now we have something like this and it's kind of"
1940400,1946080," roughly aligned and it stays aligned as we resize this entire thing so that's totally fine i'm kind of"
1946080,1951040," fine with this entire thing uh let's actually get rid of the bezier curve text right so i don't think it's"
1951040,1957120," useful anymore uh right so it's only distracting i was using that as just sort of like a it's sec faulted"
1957120,1964080," motherfuckers sec faulted that's why you should throw them in the rules okay so"
1964080,1973680," uh right so this is basically the axis that we have in here right uh that's pretty cool it's pretty cool"
1973680,1980800," that's pretty cool uh so now uh what we need to do we need to define the handlers right so the handlers"
1980800,1987680," that we're gonna put in there uh right so let me see what we can do in here so i suppose we're gonna"
1987680,1996800," just draw a circle uh right draw a circle uh draw a circle uh uh draw a circle so we probably want to use"
1996800,2003760," draw circle v so we can specify center as a vector and then the radius and the color and stuff like"
2003760,2010160," that okay so that's cool so that's the one i want to use so the center is gonna be let's put it at zero"
2010160,2016640," zero right so because we're just experimenting and stuff like that um so let's call these things nodes"
2016640,2023520," right so this is gonna be node and we're gonna say this is a node radius uh reduce okay and then"
2023520,2031200," we're gonna also have a node color node color so let's just like render them and see uh if we can see"
2031200,2038640," them so node radius is going to be let's say 50 right we can always adjust all of that stuff so the color"
2038640,2047600," uh node color is going to be something like red uh all right there we go what the is going emacs"
2047600,2054800," emacs is just like having a stroke or something and you know uh all right that's too too big honestly"
2054800,2060080," that's a little bit too big so let's make the radius a little bit smaller then we'll have our 25"
2060080,2069600," half as small looks all right i suppose uh maybe um maybe 15 what about 15 i think 15 is all right"
2069600,2076960," yeah that's fine that is that is totally fine that's pretty cool i really like that so that's fine uh"
2076960,2083120," right so we're probably gonna have more of them right so another one we could probably put something like"
2083120,2089840," uh so in terms of x is going to be axis length uh the full axis length and then minus axis length uh"
2089840,2095600," for y so the second one is going to be on that side right so this is the second one and we should"
2095600,2099920," be able to kind of control them if you know what i'm talking about we should be able to control them"
2099920,2107280," so to be able to control them we need to know whether we hovering over them so we can just grab them"
2107280,2115920," grab them and just drag them around and like that so we should be able to do this kind of stuff uh right"
2115920,2123280," so we could use we could check whether the mouse position right so we need to uh we need to get the"
2123280,2132800," mouse position get mouse position all right uh so we can take the mouse position so this is going to be"
2132800,2142000," vector 2 positive yeah let's call it mouse right so and as far as we have a bunch of functions that check the collision"
2142000,2148000," right so call light collision or something something something check collision"
2148000,2157360," yeah point circle check collision point circle so this one is very useful this one is very freaking useful"
2157360,2171760," okay so essentially we can just take this entire stuff and maybe maybe we can like put it into a separate sort of thing in here so we can factor out this"
2171760,2178960," center and the reason why i put it into a separate uh separate scope is because i want to have a similar"
2178960,2189280," variable called the center uh center in a for a different thing in here too right so and once you have this"
2189280,2197200," center you can quite easily check whether the mouse at that specific center at that specific radius"
2197760,2206480," intersects right whether it intersects or not and if it intersects we probably want to actually draw this"
2206480,2214480," entire thing with a different color right node uh you know hover color let's call it hover color and if"
2214480,2226480," it's not hovered we're gonna just draw it as color right so the hover color let's maybe make it yellow or something like that the color of the piece uh right so this is going to be the color of the piece yellow one"
2226480,2233520," uh right and uh yeah so we're going to just leave it as this so this is the first point essentially"
2233520,2240240," and this is not going to work that easily as you can see because we are having the screen coordinates"
2240240,2248000," right so these are the screen coordinates mouse is in screen coordinates but the entire thing is in the world"
2248000,2254320," coordinates so what we need to do we need to take the mouse position and somehow map it into the"
2254320,2262000," into the world coordinates right as far as i know radio does in fact has uh have uh something like that i"
2262000,2267200," don't quite remember so let's actually find all the functions that accept the camera or something like that"
2267200,2276320," um right so i think it's near begin mode 2d then the camera 2d uh i don't know get camera matrix we can take"
2276320,2285840," a matrix oh okay so get screen to world 2d so get the world space position for 2d camera screen space"
2285840,2291680," position so this is probably what we want actually uh believe it or not this is probably what we want so we"
2291680,2298720," can go ahead and just do the conversion uh so we take the position of the mouse right and we take the"
2298720,2304480," camera and we convert this entire stuff to the world coordinate so that's probably what we want in here"
2304480,2307680," that's probably what we want all right so now if i do"
2307680,2316800," we can detect whether we hovering over so that means we can drug it"
2316800,2324800," all right i'm sorry i'm a professional streamer"
2324800,2330560," all right so i'm supposed to do this kind of shot otherwise the stream is not engaging okay uh all right"
2333840,2339600," can your react do that can you react dude i don't think so"
2339600,2350400," you can't do this kind of in react without the use effect you you literally can't do that it's"
2350400,2355200," impossible here easy easy easy anyways"
2358000,2367600," so let's continue um and uh yeah so essentially we kind of need to store uh these things somewhere"
2367600,2374800," right so okay like i can check that like covers over this entire stuff and everything but um i need to"
2374800,2380640," probably store this entire thing as some sort of a state right i need to store this some sort of a state"
2380640,2389280," so we probably want to take all of these centers and factor them out into uh sort of like array of nodes"
2389280,2397360," if you know what i'm talking about the array of nodes uh so it's going to vector two uh nodes uh and"
2397360,2401920," we're going to have four of them like for now we're going to have two of them uh all right we don't even"
2401920,2406160," have to specify because this thing is going to automatically do that for us i also want to make it"
2406160,2411520," static i'm not sure if it's a good idea right so because the the plugins are not really reacting well"
2411520,2420000," for like with static right reacting um so uh what we need to do we need to take all of these values"
2420000,2424640," and kind of move them in here right so we're kind of moving them in here including this one"
2425520,2433200," uh right so yes yes yes i also want to be able to actually have the amount of these nodes so we're"
2433200,2438880," going to do something like uh maybe nodes count which is going to be equal to knob do we even include"
2438880,2450160," enough i think we do include move excuse me uh all right um so we we we don't include knob okay so the"
2450160,2454560," compiler will tell me that something doesn't right it doesn't really matter so in here what we want to do"
2454560,2459840," actually uh we want to iterate through all of the nodes right so i'm going to be iterating from zero"
2459840,2466880," to nodes uh nodes count right so nodes count did i call it nodes count i don't remember uh yeah i call"
2466880,2475760," it nodes count so in the center is in fact one of the nodes right so nodes i uh yep that's that's the center"
2475760,2483360," and then here it's going to be nodes i so now i can completely redo all of that and now this entire shed is"
2483360,2489600," supposed to work for both of those things so it doesn't like axis length because it's a variable"
2489600,2492560," and you can't because it's a fucking"
2492560,2503520," and that's why people use pre-processors in c even though it would be convenient to actually you know use"
2503520,2510000," constants and stuff we could try to make them constants okay can i make them constants but it's not going to help"
2510000,2517120," anybody yeah so implicit oh implicit okay so that worked actually wait a second that worked all of a"
2517120,2524000," sudden if i make them constants it actually what the is this is this c plus plus"
2524000,2532000," or something but but anyway so we need to include knob.h for a di append or for uh like why did it work"
2535840,2542960," so you can define a local non-static constant variable local non-static constant variable"
2542960,2546320," and then use that variable in the definition of a static array"
2548000,2555200," because it's known at compile cool but why then i can't do shit like that uh where i have something"
2555200,2557440," like two and then i do xn"
2559840,2565040," it's known at compile time why why why the fuck i can't do that then"
2565040,2574480," gc this is a good point gcc extensions yeah it's pedantic time"
2574480,2581040," pedantic time all right um so where are all of these things so let's actually do"
2581920,2589440," uh all right uh and let's actually do knob but we actually do force right so it's going to rebuild"
2589440,2602560," everything in here all right so it will take some time to rebuild all this thing"
2602560,2606000," got him"
2606000,2611520," fucking got him oh okay so it actually oh all right"
2612960,2618640," c plus plus only available well i mean ah it's it's because of c plus plus fuck c plus plus all"
2618640,2623600," right so there's a little bit of c plus plus building in here uh fuck this i don't care right"
2623600,2631120," so let's actually only build c um right so it's just complaining about like me using c stuff in c plus"
2631120,2637120," plus so what is it it doesn't like something about x macros it really doesn't like uh so see for a bit"
2637840,2644080," okay okay so that's fine this is fine right because we're assigning like we're casting function pointers"
2644080,2647840," on the platform where it's fine right so this kind of stuff is fine"
2647840,2654400," um we might as well so it's it's it's pedantic right so you can't really even disable that"
2654400,2665520," no even pedantic doesn't complain about this kind of stuff right where is the bezier"
2667120,2673120," right even pedantic is totally fine with you having local const variable"
2673120,2677200," and using it in the definition of the static array"
2677200,2687840," how are we supposed to do that with isoc then you don't as far as you know you mean the the casting"
2687840,2693360," of function pointer to void star you're not supposed to it's not standard c this is this is not standard c"
2695680,2702560," so because it's a very platform specific feature it's a very platform specific feature because"
2702560,2710800," depending on the platform there are platforms where size of the data pointer and function pointer are"
2710800,2718240," different because functions uh the codes are stored in a completely different place or sometimes even"
2718240,2724000," a good example of the web assembly is in web assembly right a good example of the top of my head is web assembly"
2724000,2734480," in web assembly you have a data you have a memory but the code is not stored in the memory of web assembly"
2734480,2742240," code is located in some weird place that is not actually addressable for security reasons i suppose right"
2742240,2748480," right so the code and data they are in two completely different places and in web assembly you can't just"
2748480,2753440," take a pointer to some code and modify it like you do in x86 64 and because of that"
2754480,2762640," the how you do function pointers in x86 64 it's not possible in web assembly the way they do function"
2762640,2771360," pointers in web assembly they have so-called tables right so if you have a function and to which you want"
2771360,2779440," to take a function pointer the c compiler clang will automatically create that function in a function table"
2779440,2790160," so then you can call that function by its index on web assembly in web assembly function pointer is an index"
2790160,2797440," in the table right so because of these kind of things right so where you have platforms where"
2797440,2805280," function may not be in the memory the isoc the standard c simply prohibits you to convert between data"
2805280,2812640," pointers and function pointers but we know 100 that we are on x86 64 because of that it's fine right i"
2812640,2819200," don't really plan to run this thing on web assembly for instance um so yeah that's basically how it works"
2819200,2826720," what you what if you explicitly cast um i think it's going to be like on web assembly right so if i take"
2826720,2832320," the data pointer and explicitly cast it to a function pointer and like just force the compiler to do that"
2832320,2837680," i suppose it will take the value of the like the address and will interpret it as the index in the"
2837680,2844720," table but usually table contains like few dozens of the functions so it's basically will try to access"
2844720,2851360," the table out of bounds and it will probably crash so that's how i predict what was going to happen if"
2851360,2857120," you try to do this kind of stuff so it's probably not going to good right it's not going to be good"
2860240,2867280," so that's my hypothesis that's my hypothesis anyways so yeah so apparently you can do that"
2867280,2874560," but you can't do uh the stuff where you define constant and and when then define the array out of"
2874560,2879360," that so you can't do that bizarre absolutely bizarre c is bizarre"
2879360,2887440," more in terms of if gcc will let you yeah maybe it won't even let you but i mean we could try to check"
2887440,2894000," that but i mean that's too much of a tangent unfortunately too much of a tangent uh anyways"
2894000,2899520," so let me uh let me try to recompile this and i think i'm gonna actually get rid of the pedantic"
2900320,2907920," uh right so because it's kind of staying in my way right let's rebuild the entire thing"
2907920,2927680," okay george busy okay uh so um let me let me take a look at this entire chat so uh now this entire stuff"
2927680,2932240," works literally works literally anywhere actually look at that right so it works for both of them"
2932240,2943840," and the question is how can we start dragging those things uh not drug dragging i'm i'm dragging my point"
2943840,2952560," all right so um i suppose maybe we're gonna keep the index of the like i mean english is not my first language"
2952560,2960160," okay okay like you guys have way too many vowels like like like ee and all the different and all of a"
2960160,2964960," sudden they're changing the meaning of the word right so why do you have to distinguish between drag"
2964960,2973520," and drug it sounds the same for me right so what's that i can't even hear the difference of drag drug"
2975440,2986240," yeah so it's kind of similar with the russian sound uh right e e and do you know like do you"
2986240,3000320," hear the difference between these two sounds e e e e e e e e e e a lot of people actually say that"
3000320,3005040," they can't really hear like english speakers specifically can't really hear as opposed okay"
3005040,3012960," polls that that's a little bit cheating right so being polish is cheating okay being polish is cheating"
3012960,3021680," oh so in german it's also kind of similar i see yeah okay in hungarian as well the spanish okay so"
3021680,3025520," people can hear that it's probably i suppose it's only english speakers can't hear it english"
3025520,3034000," has e and e it's the difference between sheet and ships uh not really i don't know maybe"
3034640,3044400," um in russian when do you say ah or oh it's a it's the classical reduction of o's things right so"
3044400,3052640," essentially the o's that are not under the stress that they reduce to ah and quite often into schwa"
3052640,3060640," right so schwa is basically some sort of uncomprehensible vowel sound right that's the"
3060640,3066640," definition of schwa right so incomprehensible vowel it's some sort of vowel there it's it's difficult"
3066640,3075280," to understand what the fuck it is there but it's schwa right uh right so it's it's basically you have"
3075280,3082880," all it's not under stress so it's reduced to ah or just schwa especially if you speak quickly"
3082880,3102160," okay so uh it's why russian say production instead of production yeah exactly exactly exactly exactly"
3102160,3108560," i actually explained it it's kind of like it's on the level of reflex right so it's so good used to that"
3108560,3115520," that that's like it's just like we transfer that to to other languages that we speak um all right"
3115520,3126480," so what we do in here i need to keep track of the um of the currently dragging dragging uh node right so"
3126480,3133520," dragged node so i suppose i'm going to be using integers so i have an opportunity to actually say"
3133520,3141120," that i'm not dragging anything by putting minus one in there right so essentially now"
3141120,3154800," if i'm yeah so if uh dragged node is greater or equal than zero what we want to do in here is actually"
3154800,3163200," take that node it's kind of kind of important that this specific node as well is less than the nodes count"
3163520,3169440," right so less than nodes count we can even maybe swap this kind of stuff around so it looks like a"
3169440,3176960," range in here right but the problem is here is that this is integer and this is size t and that effectively"
3176960,3182240," means that we have uh unsigned comparison with the same thing but i don't think it's that big of a"
3182240,3188000," yeah comparison of integer expression of a different sinus right so after checking that this thing is greater"
3188000,3193840," than zero we know that it's not negative right so that means it's safe to convert it to unsigned one"
3193840,3198720," and it's not gonna like underflow or overflow or anything like that so it's super safe to actually"
3198720,3204560," do something like this because we know it's positive after checking this specific thing so right so we need"
3204560,3210480," to do that because this is c it's not rust it's not gonna at runtime check like out of bouncing this and"
3210480,3218000," stuff like that uh right so we're gonna do nodes dragged node and we're gonna just assign the mouse"
3218000,3224400," position to that specific node if we're currently dragging that thing dragging that thing all right so"
3224400,3233280," essentially now so if um if we have any certain thing we're going to draw it one way or another"
3234400,3243120," right so that's totally fine so another thing we probably want to do if we're currently uh not dragging"
3243120,3256080," right but uh-huh we are hovering over certain thing and pressing so that means we have to do that in a loop"
3256080,3265040," right so uh so like the coloring kind of makes it a little bit difficult i think the coloring kind of"
3265040,3273360," makes it a little difficult so i think i'm going to actually extract this kind of stuff to here right"
3273360,3284560," and maybe even do something like that if hover do that uh otherwise do that like so and then get rid of"
3284560,3292480," the entire condition in here right so that's i think a little bit better right if we're currently dragging"
3292480,3301680," something right so if this entire thing is dragged we probably don't do anything otherwise if it's not"
3301680,3314800," dragged and we hover and is mouse uh there was something like mouse pressed i think so we need to find"
3314800,3323600," mouse button yeah so there is a mouse it's kind of interesting right i suppose people often confused"
3323600,3331360," mouse left button and mouse button left so both of them are fine right so both of them are fine"
3331360,3340720," uh so let me now see if we hover and mouse button is pressed we can quite easily say that the"
3340720,3348480," dragged node is um essentially it's going to be the index right so the drag node is going to be"
3348480,3354320," essentially the index and in fact like we don't really do anything if we are currently dragging as"
3354320,3359600," of right now so we might as well just do something like this i could have applied demorgan law but i don't"
3359600,3367840," want to do that right so honestly um so we might as well even do something like dragging and just put it"
3367840,3377680," like that and just if dragging we're updating the drag node like this so then later we can just do uh dragging"
3378240,3388480," dragging so it's kind of important to check that the drag node also doesn't go over the nodes count so"
3388480,3394160," you don't have out of bounds access or stuff like that so yeah we can do these kind of things so we can"
3394160,3400800," do this kind of things does it compile all right let's go so what do we have in here can we uh oh okay"
3401600,3408960," i think i think i need it all right so i suppose i suppose i suppose we have to do is mouse button"
3408960,3413280," uh pressed all right is mouse button"
3413280,3425520," down right so if you're not dragging and you hover and is mouse button down we actually do that uh if you"
3425520,3431680," are dragging right so we kind of still have to do this kind of stuff and is mouse"
3431680,3437680," yeah i think we need to do that mouse button pressed"
3437680,3444000," and if we're dragging and mouse button released specifically mouse button left"
3444000,3449600," mouse button left we have to set dragged node to minus one"
3450400,3456080," there we go so that's probably what we have to do is it going to work let's find out let's find out"
3456080,3468880," okay uh doesn't work it doesn't work cool all right so if not dragging we're hovering and mouse button"
3468880,3475920," pressed so i should become drag node so on the next iteration we should be setting did i make a"
3475920,3480160," fucky wacky or oopsie doopsie somewhere i don't know where did i make a fucky wacky"
3480160,3488240," set dragging maybe it's it's already set"
3488240,3493840," um so dragged node we just set in drag node"
3493840,3498480," i don't know mate i don't know"
3499840,3508000," so okay so initially dragged node right it's minus one it is minus one so that means"
3508000,3514640," this thing is going to be false right so maybe it does make to debug it makes sense to debug so i can"
3514640,3521040," just step through this analogy but i can kind of step step through manually i think right so this is going"
3521040,3526560," to be false so this is going to fall through okay so that's fine so we're checking that we're hovering"
3526560,3532960," this entire stuff right so we're drawing everything accordingly if we are not dragging so we're not"
3532960,3540800," dragging we're hovering and the mouse button was pressed the left button specifically i oh i know what is going on"
3540800,3551040," all right because it's reset on h duration that explains it that actually explains it okay"
3551920,3559120," uh right so still doesn't work okay well i'm gonna try to to restart this and that stuff so i'm"
3559120,3566480," rebuilding everything um okay so all right now it works i i just need to to actually restart the"
3566480,3570160," whole thing okay so that works first try"
3579040,3584720," all right all right so i and now by the way i can have many of them honestly i can actually have many"
3584720,3592480," of them um to be fair like this kind of static stuff uh would be way better if it was part of the"
3592480,3599680," plugging state itself uh so then i could have many of them all right so we can maybe even introduce"
3599680,3608080," something like type def struct uh nodes all right and in here this is going to be just a vector items"
3608080,3614400," uh right so then we're going to say size count and then capacity and so on and so forth so then later"
3614400,3621280," i can say nodes right there we go so we have nodes in here so when i um loading assets and stuff like"
3621280,3632480," plugin reset um i suppose plugin reset is essentially um taking the nodes setting them to zero and basically"
3632480,3641280," re-appending them back right so we can do knob di append uh right so p nodes and let's maybe actually"
3641280,3647200," put all these things in there so that means i need to be able to uh to access all of these parameters now so"
3647200,3654080," the time has finally come uh to make them uh pre-processed things in here unfortunately"
3654080,3661040," i wish i didn't have to do that but it's just c right so there's no way around that unfortunately chat"
3661040,3668560," unfortunately it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't is it not i think it is the missile knows"
3668560,3674720," where it is because it knows where it isn't right so the usual stuff um so maybe i have to do it like"
3674720,3681440," that actually so we have items capacity the plugin reset uh what kind of stuff do we even set in there"
3681440,3687520," that's a good question so we set these things zero and minus axis length uh right so let's actually put"
3687520,3694880," them in here maybe i'm gonna use a little bit of emacs magic yet again knob da append uh right so this one"
3694880,3702800," is going to be vector2 uh we are pushing all of that stuff into nodes like so it would be also better to wrap"
3702800,3709120," it's around like that there we go so that makes it a little bit more dynamic so that kind of gets rid of"
3709120,3717920," this entire stuff and we also need to keep drugged node in here as well uh and what the"
3717920,3722480," was that why do you copy everything in here i only copied drag node i suppose it's kind of appended all"
3722480,3730160," of that stuff in there so in the minus one also has to be in here i suppose dragged node minus one"
3730160,3734720," dragged node minus one okay so we move this stuff around so that means the entire share doesn't"
3734720,3741760," compile let's go to the compilationers what are you asking me about just just recompile okay freaking"
3741760,3750640," change it jesus christ brother all right so uh okay nodes uh-huh okay okay all right so dragged node all right"
3750640,3757440," so now it is accessed through the p right so it's accessed through the p what else do we have in here"
3757440,3765760," nodes count nodes count is this thing uh nodes account let's actually query replace all the nodes count with"
3765760,3776640," basically p nodes dot and that's about it so that it was only one in here so uh this one is items uh another one yeah drag node"
3776640,3783440," so yeah so once you have like a statically typed compiled language it's super easy to refactor"
3783440,3789360," things without even any ade and any lsp and shit like that you just follow the compilation errors"
3789360,3793840," and then it just works isn't that beautiful i think it's pretty freaking beautiful it's a general approach"
3793840,3800880," general approach are always good in my opinion my new friend all right so that seems to be working that seems to be twerking"
3801520,3805680," all right all right so that's segmentation faulted but that's fine it's kind of expected because we changed"
3805680,3816480," the schema of the whole thing right uh okay so i wonder now so what we can do we can go to the plug reset"
3816480,3822720," and then we can say okay i want to add something like in between these things right so this one is going"
3822720,3830400," to be uh half of this stuff and this thing is also going to be sort of half uh of that stuff maybe minus"
3830400,3837840," zero five right something like this right then i'm gonna uh hot reload and then restart now we have three"
3837840,3843600," points and we can have as many points as we want actually as many points as we want honestly uh right"
3843600,3851840," we can add another fourth one uh which is like 75 percent uh or something like that uh right so now"
3851840,3856000," we have four points in here so as you can see we're probably not going to have more than four points"
3856000,3862720," because that's everything we need for the busier curve um right so and we also kind of want to limit"
3862720,3869600," the position of the curve um to be inside of the rectangle right so that's one of the things we probably"
3869600,3875040," want to do so as we move this entire stuff right as we move this entire stuff let me actually take this"
3875040,3884880," uh node right i want to do something like this because this is a very huge expression i don't want"
3884880,3890320," to be writing it over and over again right so i've got this thing then i'm setting the mouse to this"
3890320,3897040," expression and now what i want to do i want to kind of like clamp the x between zero and one so does"
3897040,3904080," ray deep have anything like clamp at least in math so do you have clamp it does have clamp"
3904080,3914640," it does have clamp look at that isn't a power smile for you so does it have like a clamp that is uh you"
3914640,3922240," know accepts the point or some like that um where is the math so clamp all right"
3923680,3930880," yeah so there's a very convenient paradigm with clamp is basically you do clamp i think i saw that in j"
3930880,3937360," right so i think i saw that in j right so you do something like that and basically like modifies it"
3937360,3943120," right so without that you kind of have to do this kind of shirt which is fine okay it's fine but it's"
3943120,3947360," like with the point it's a little bit more convenient i think right it's just like you don't have to do the"
3947360,3954160," assignment um so it's more like comparative and shit like that uh anyway so it's fine it's fine it's fine"
3954160,3960800," it doesn't even fucking compile me because it's what it's it's actually vector two right it's actually"
3960800,3969760," vector two okay fine all right so now can i oh it's actually not one it's zero and"
3969760,3977120," axis length yeah so we'll also we'll have to like map the ranges from zero to axis length to zero to one"
3977120,3982880," right axis length uh all right so let's actually do something like this and let me see"
3982880,3986480," uh-huh let's kind of wait"
3989440,3994160," why does it go outside that doesn't make any fucking sense wait um"
3994160,4006400," nope am i an idiot am i actually needed so did i yeah so probably negative yeah you're right you're"
4006400,4015840," probably negative all right why does it clamp it okay so it clamps it like that but oh that probably"
4015840,4021040," you have to swap them around as well because the negative is less than zero freaking the"
4021040,4030320," coordinate systems i swear to god uh finally and they are clamped within that rectangle they're clamped"
4030320,4036160," within this rectangle this is actually beautiful uh this is absolutely beautiful and yeah so this thing"
4036160,4044720," for this specific thing i think it should be clamped uh like for like in here it should not go left or"
4044720,4049920," right or anything like that the same thing for this one and for these two i think they should not go"
4049920,4057520," over each other right so they should not go over each other um so yes so that's basically the idea"
4057520,4064880," all right so but i'm already streaming for one hour right i ran out of tea i think i want to make"
4064880,4069760," a small break i think i want to make a small break i want to refill my cup of tea and after the small break"
4069760,4077120," we're going to continue working on this busy curve editor so sounds good sounds good let's go all right"
4077120,4087360," so let's go ahead and maybe limit the amount of notes right um maybe it was a bad idea to actually"
4087360,4094800," introduce these kind of nodes things right so i don't really want to have um like infinite amount of notes i"
4094800,4100480," want to have like exactly four of them uh so let's go ahead and just like do something like this uh so"
4100480,4106400," let's go back in here so but it would be kind of nice to maybe count nodes four in here so i can easily"
4106400,4112000," just uh iterate through them when it's needed but generally i know precisely how many nodes"
4112560,4117440," uh i i'm gonna have and they even they're gonna be even clamped differently that's the thing they're"
4117440,4126160," gonna be even clamped differently um so now uh let me jesus christ bro uh so in in here what we do"
4126160,4138240," um i suppose we can just hard code all these things right so can i just go ahead and say p nodes and this is"
4138240,4145600," going to be zero one two three blah blah blah blah and this is that and then this is that so one"
4145600,4153840," two three all right so now uh let's go to the rest of these things uh okay so there's extra"
4153840,4161760," parentheses that it didn't like that is fine that is totally fine so we have p nodes count uh i want"
4161760,4167440," to grab this thing and i'm going to create replace that with account nodes uh there's only two of them"
4167440,4175440," that's fine what's the next one uh when we're accessing this thing i'm going to create replace it with just"
4175440,4185440," nodes and that seems to be working that seems to be twerking so let's actually go and start"
4185440,4192080," and yeah it's still working it is still twerking so that's cool that's cool that's cool so one of the"
4192080,4202640," things i want to do actually i want to connect the first and second node right together and uh third and"
4202640,4207760," fourth so then they will create these two handlers that you can move around and stuff like that similar"
4207760,4214240," to inkscape right uh let me now see how we're going to be approaching all that stuff so we need to draw"
4214240,4222560," another line essentially draw line uh and we're going to be drawing p nodes zero so this is the start"
4222560,4232240," and the end is going to be one um so the thickness maybe how can we call that so we can call it handle"
4232240,4239680," and this is going to be handle thickness and handle color so i'm not really sure how exactly what's going"
4239680,4245360," to be the color in here so we can make it maybe maybe green or something like that i'm freaking out"
4245360,4252880," we'll see we'll see and then we're going to be connecting um so zero one two three right so we're"
4252880,4260720," going to be connecting these things uh all right so the thickness is going to be maybe uh around the same"
4260720,4269920," as the axis thickness uh maybe maybe half of that how about half of that so handle color uh maybe um"
4269920,4275440," let's put it also as yellow all that can be adjusted right so don't really want to spend too much time"
4275440,4280800," on yeah there we go so that's that's what they are that's how they look like now uh right these two"
4280800,4287920," things so yeah that's pretty cool uh by the way i just recently remembered"
4287920,4294240," uh ray leap has support for bezier curves i can actually render them"
4294240,4297680," yo"
4297680,4303440," draw segment cubic bezier curve in and out in the play but why does it accept"
4304240,4312480," wait how do i why does it accept only two points in here uh draw segment cubic bezier curve in out"
4312480,4313440," interpolation"
4313440,4322240," so i would expect to have like at least four points so if it's a cubic bezier curve"
4324160,4330880," okay let's actually try to do that like how it will be kind of actually super convenient uh because"
4330880,4336080," then i would wouldn't have to actually draw it myself uh so let's actually put it between these two things"
4336080,4346080," uh uh right so okay oh it's you can't control it at all that's that's lame that's lame"
4347360,4354720," yeah so it's kind of useful for for diagrams and all right so it's it's very useful for diagrams but"
4354720,4361920," for for what we're trying to do it's not particularly useful right so it's like you can't uh you can't"
4361920,4367520," adjust it and stuff like that okay so that's fine that's totally fine so it's very limited in that regard"
4367520,4376880," all right but um yeah whatever um okay so now what we want to do we want to probably try to go ahead"
4377360,4384480," and just like render the bezier curve that is defined by these four points right so we can"
4384480,4393920," do the whole nested lurping thing but if you take all of this nested lurping and basically turn it into"
4393920,4400560," into a formula that depends on just t um you can actually end up with a very nice formula that doesn't"
4400560,4405440," require like constant lurping and stuff like that so you end up with a cubic equation or something"
4405440,4413440," so i think it was even described in that wikipedia article we can just yoink that uh formula and just"
4413440,4421760," use it to sort of sample the uh bezier curve uh and uh yeah just render it uh so linear quadratic"
4421760,4430000," where is the cubic yeah here it is essentially so that's that's literally the formula right so p0 p1 p2 p3"
4430000,4437280," are the points and then t is basically the t parameter from zero to one so and you basically"
4437280,4442960," sample uh from zero to one with a certain resolution and you just plug into that formula"
4442960,4448160," and it will just give you the bezier curve right so let's just go ahead and do that so i think it's"
4448160,4454240," going to be interesting um so let's maybe do the following thing i'm going to introduce something"
4454240,4459600," like a res which is going to be resolution so let's uh like in how many parts we can define"
4459600,4467920," one let's divide it into 10 of 100 of them i want to be like 30 right so we don't really want to draw"
4467920,4472560," too many points right so because it's probably going to be very uh very long oh there's a spline"
4472560,4482000," bezier quadratic okay so that's actually pretty cool uh spline bezier oh this is actually good"
4482000,4486640," okay so that's actually pretty cool so that means we won't have to do that uh all right so let's go"
4486640,4496480," ahead and do that uh so that's that's super convenient thank you uh-huh so um yeah let me let me do"
4496480,4501840," so can i it can even specify the thickness that's actually super cool um no let's actually do that"
4501840,4506800," ourselves let's actually do that ourselves and then we can try the uh the ray leap thing right so"
4506800,4512880," because i i want it to be a little bit educational for myself right so let's do the resolution uh right"
4512880,4522160," so the resolution is going to be like around 30 and let's iterate from uh zero to 30 all right so plus"
4522160,4530640," plus i so and the t is going to be basically and actually this has to be resolution so i converted to float"
4530640,4536000," divided by resolution so it's never gonna be really one uh which is fine so we're kind of skipping one"
4536000,4545920," so whatever um so let's take this that formula right so the first thing is one minus t and we have to"
4545920,4555120," take uh a cube of that right so this is the cube um which is fine so maybe because of that we want to have"
4555120,4562160," like an inverse of t right so which will make it a little bit easier to work with right so this is inverse"
4562160,4571200," of t uh multiplied by the first point right so this is going to be node zero um yeah so it's a little bit"
4571200,4583120," too much but essentially what we probably want to do is vector 2 scale right and we're scaling this first"
4583120,4592480," point with this thing with the cube of uh inverse square uh inverse inverse t so then we have uh three"
4592480,4599680," multiplied so let me split the screen and maybe put this entire thing somewhere here so i have the formula"
4599680,4606400," uh uh in front of uh in front of my eyes uh right so i'm trying to reduce the size of the page but it's"
4606400,4614080," taking too long for some reason i don't really want to know why uh okay so where is the cubic"
4614080,4626880," biser curve all right so this is three uh three q a square of inverse t and then just t and what we're"
4626880,4635600," scaling in here we are scaling the node one there we go so this is the second component here then we have"
4635600,4650800," 3 multiplied by inverse t but then square of just t and here we're scaling uh the second one right and the"
4650800,4661840," last point is just the cube of t and we are scaling the last one in here right so you can kind of derive that"
4661840,4667760," formula by basically inlining all of the lerps and stuff like that right so we can just like inline them"
4667760,4675520," so and in here we have plus plus and minus right so this is plus this is plus this is minus and that's"
4675520,4685440," basically the final point so but you can't just add vectors together in um in c so what we have to do in"
4685440,4696640," here right so let's actually put it as b so this is the first point then we do vector add b so this is"
4696640,4709440," the second point like so uh right and we have to reassign the b then we add again this point and then"
4709440,4720880," this time we subtract this point right unfortunately you can't really overload the operators in c so"
4720880,4726720," because of that we have to do this kind of but it's i think it's like readable to some extent i think i"
4726720,4732880," think it's fine uh right i think it's fine it would be kind of nice to maybe realign some things so they"
4732880,4738480," look like more or less nice so we can see what the is going yeah if you align things like"
4738480,4745600," that i think it's fine um right so this is the first thing right so then we add this thing sequentially"
4745600,4750560," and we subtract the last one so and this is where we kind of want to draw like a point like a sample"
4751440,4760800," so i hope i hope i didn't make any any mistake in the formula right um so draw circle v draw circle v"
4760800,4770640," and we have to specify the center we have to specify the radius uh so busy sample radius right and then"
4770640,4777520," busy sample color right so we have to define those things let's go ahead and maybe define them somewhere"
4778640,4788560," uh right so define busy sample radius so what other radius radii we have uh so the smallest one is 15"
4788560,4797280," so i suppose uh right so this one could be just five right and this one could be yellow yet again"
4797280,4803040," all right so i really like to use too many different colors all right so what do we have in here uh it's"
4803040,4810160," actually called nodes right so let's quickly fix all of that so this is nodes uh what else do we have in"
4810160,4818560," here and that seems to be fine uh and that went somewhere okay so that's actually kind of funny why did"
4818560,4825840," it went completely haywire um yeah but that's that's kind of cool already so"
4827920,4838720," huh so maybe i fucked up something somewhere in in the formula that's definitely up in the formula"
4838720,4846960," uh i wish the website was not this slow i'm trying to reset its size but it's just like why wikipedia"
4846960,4852880," lagging can anybody tell me why wikipedia is fucking lagging all of a sudden add instead of subtract but they"
4852880,4860560," were subtracting earned they uh am i am i tripping yeah i think i'm true yeah okay so i saw minuses"
4860560,4867920," somewhere and i just thought that it's plus okay so that makes sense all right uh so let's get rid of"
4867920,4876320," that so i'm sorry for the fuck you wacky situation uh-huh all right so that's fine so this is bezier curve"
4876320,4883840," so this is how easy it is to draw bezier curve right so and that's roughly what i wanted to do honestly"
4883840,4891040," disallowing them to go over one was a bad idea because i want them to overshoot a little bit yeah"
4891040,4898720," so being able to overshoot is kind of important honestly right let's get rid of that um clamping"
4899680,4910240," let's get rid of the clampage uh right so the first two nodes they do need the clampage"
4910240,4916080," yeah so because this is the function i want not the function i deserve but very but the function i want"
4916080,4924400," roughly so and i also want to be able to maybe adjust the zoom uh right so if i do the zoom and i make it a"
4924400,4929520," little bit smaller so maybe it should be adjustable through a wheel but this is something that can be"
4929520,4938560," changed right so there we go uh look at that so yeah so that's basically the function that i want to have"
4938560,4945680," in here it's pretty cool uh right scroll wheel yeah"
4948800,4955920," and so it would be kind of nice to know the actual parameters of these points right so the"
4955920,4961280," actual parameters so maybe one of the things we want to do in here we want to draw them somewhere"
4961280,4973120," uh let's go ahead and draw them we already have a font uh right so draw text xc so raylib draw text xc"
4977920,4989200," so we already have the font uh and here we can use text format and we can just i wonder how i can"
4989200,4994720," actually approach all that stuff i need some sort of a buffer because i want to"
4994720,5003840," um render some c code right effectively i want to render some c code so maybe i'm going to introduce"
5003840,5010560," the string buffer i know that knob uh has string yeah it has a knob string builder look at that look"
5010560,5015520," at that look at that look at that so uh let's actually introduce that so it's going to be sb"
5015520,5022880," and uh on every frame what we're doing with this thing we're actually cleaning it up actually we can"
5022880,5028400," clean it up right before uh trying to use that right so this is going to be like this"
5029120,5034160," so and in here and in here um what i'm thinking is that"
5034160,5038080," oof oof oof oof oof"
5038080,5046880," that's pain but maybe not maybe we can actually use the text format in here text format is actually useful"
5046880,5056800," for this kind of stuff um wait we have a limited amount of nodes all right and we don't plan to change"
5056800,5063520," it so that means i can literally just do some stupid shit like this where i yeah i can just do it like"
5063520,5071600," that and yeah so that's that's that's actually way easier it's actually way easier i really don't plan"
5071600,5083920," to to change the amount of nodes at least for now so nodes a zero x and uh right so nodes y let's not"
5083920,5092720," overthink these things right so one two three and this one's gonna be one two three so we got the text"
5092720,5102880," format so this is the label uh const char const char label um i wonder if we can just do something like"
5102880,5111200," that okay that's cool uh so this is the label uh position let's say that the position is going to be just"
5111200,5119920," just zero uh i think we already have a font size i don't want to have any uh spacing any color the"
5119920,5126640," tint is going to be white for now all right so let's actually see what do we have in here all right that's"
5126640,5134480," a that's a crappy phone holy shit why is this so freaking crappy can i reload"
5137120,5144960," so first of all let's use a little bit of emacs magic and make the numbers a bit smaller uh maybe"
5144960,5153040," it's going to be just like two two digits after the dot that's a bit better honestly that's a bit better"
5153040,5160800," so yeah so that's the basically the parameters that we have we can see them but yeah i think it has"
5160800,5169200," something to do with how we handle the font right so when i do i even reload the assets i don't even"
5169200,5175920," reload the assets at all yeah and load the assets and then load the assets and where is the function"
5175920,5181280," that loads the assets okay so one of the things i like to do i like to generate mip maps for the fonts"
5181920,5192800," so let me do um so fonts equal ah so generate meet maps for the fonts and also set the filter bilinear"
5192800,5199360," right so that usually improves the quality of the uh of the font generally uh yeah that that's much"
5199360,5207520," better look at that look at that so that's much better we can work with this shit we can actually work with the"
5207520,5218480," shit we can use io zevka or yo zevka how is it called uh so let me change it um so are your assets fonts"
5218480,5229120," uh regular right so i think io zevka is like works better here i think i think it just works a little bit"
5229120,5235840," better yeah so it could be a little bit smaller honestly could be a little bit smaller"
5237520,5244240," the text format has its own internal static buffer yeah so it actually has like four of them or"
5244240,5252480," something right so you can basically use up to four text formats simultaneously right so it's kind of it's"
5252480,5257600," kind of cool so font size let's actually reduce the font size a little bit uh so i think it's going to be"
5257600,5267840," maybe maybe 32 all right so yeah there we go so it would be kind of maybe nice to right we can change"
5267840,5276320," this kind of stuff right and that changes i want to see them in terms of actually mapped from zero to one"
5276320,5284240," honestly it's not that hard to do actually so we just have to divide all of these things by"
5285840,5296720," by axis length uh just divide them by axis length all right so divide axis length"
5296720,5301680," and that one as well"
5301680,5309040," what the is going on excuse me"
5314160,5316560," static redeclaration new region following"
5316560,5322560," am i going crazy what just happened"
5322560,5325120," i think"
5325120,5326960," brah"
5326960,5332640," axis length something the definition of axis length"
5332640,5340560," fucked up so freaking dramatically wait what what the excuse me"
5340560,5351200," what did they what did they what did they do like what did oh my god like i put some some garbage"
5351200,5352560," something like oh my god"
5352560,5358240," like i know what is going on i like i know what is going on it's probably"
5358240,5366640," it's the stupid c can't properly report an error or something like that it's just like it's so"
5368480,5370880," freaking common"
5370880,5371280," uh"
5371280,5380960," did i accidentally i think i said yeah i accidentally removed this thing that's that's probably what"
5380960,5384800," happened oh it's so dumb like it happens so"
5384800,5388400," fucking often it's happened so fucking often it's insane"
5388400,5396080," uh all right so and it's just like you you forget to close one curly brace and it just explodes with"
5396080,5401600," bullshit like absolute fucking bullshit it's like oh some some definition on study"
5401600,5405760," fucking tell me that i forgot to close the curly brace bro"
5405760,5407680," so fucking bad"
5407680,5413120," maybe it's hard to actually report that to be fair gcc developers put a lot of effort into"
5413120,5414160," properly reporting stuff"
5417120,5423840," but anyway um so what i want to do i want to kind of align this entire thing a little bit better so i"
5423840,5430560," want you to center it um but to center this entire stuff we actually need to know its size so we need"
5430560,5437120," to do some measure text right so there's a measure text xc where we do font label"
5437120,5445360," and uh the font size and the spacing right so here we can have uh vector two"
5445360,5450960," vector two i said label uh size right so we've got a label size"
5452080,5458240," uh and by the way i completely forgot that i'm also supposed to actually uh divided by axis length"
5458240,5467200," okay axis length and that one as well axis length"
5467200,5476080," right so let me see let me see yeah there we go so this is what i want you to see so this is how we're"
5476080,5483440," going to be defining actual um you know busy curves for our functions and stuff like that right so that's"
5483440,5485920," the actual definition in here right"
5485920,5497360," honestly i think these handles should be stuck to these handles if you know what i mean but that's"
5497360,5502080," besides the point honestly right so that could be fixed a little bit later because in inkscape"
5502080,5507600," when you move this thing around it actually moves this thing along right it moves this thing along"
5507600,5512720," which which kind of makes sense right so but but for now it's it's fine it's fine uh anyways um"
5512720,5519760," so now uh we have label size that's what i wanted uh so we also need to have some sort of"
5519760,5526160," like a label position uh label position so when the label position is going to be"
5527120,5536080," initially zero right it's going to be initially zero like so so but then we take the label position x"
5536080,5547200," and we add uh actually add the axis length like half of the axis length all right so that's what we want to"
5547200,5553760," do uh huh uh i don't know what the has happened but it doesn't"
5555200,5563200," automatically reload this is because i didn't use that position that i just crafted in here"
5563200,5571520," i didn't use that position this is a label position there we go all right so that put it in here"
5571520,5584480," so now i can subtract half of the label size label size x half of that all right so now it is more or less"
5584480,5593600," centered uh but i would also like to take y and maybe subtract the whole axis length so it is on top"
5593600,5601520," all right it is on top and it would be also nice to have some sort of a padding all right label padding"
5601520,5608000," all right so let's define label padding label padding so it's going to be maybe 100 or something"
5608000,5618960," uh subtracting um subtracting didn't work so i yeah so since i'm subtracting this thing i have to actually"
5618960,5627360," kind of add it in here that makes sense um sure there we go so finally i have this kind of thing so"
5628000,5640400," that's the sort of value of the um of the bezier curve of the bezier curve so another thing i want"
5640400,5652960," to be able to do uh when i press something when i press something but i need to pick a key um so let me let me see"
5652960,5663920," um if uh why did you align it like that if is key pressed key c"
5665840,5676880," okay okay all right all right so ray lip uh clipboard set clipboard"
5683760,5701200," all right so uh what i can do now is maybe modify the this kind of stuff uh right and then copy paste this"
5701200,5711440," stuff into the clipboard so then i can use that in uh in the things right so like that's it that's literally"
5711440,5716400," what i wanted to achieve like because i needed a function that looks like this roughly i just"
5716400,5720480," defined it and i copy pasted it so now i need to plug it into my animation"
5720480,5724880," all right i need to plug it into my animation so let's actually try to do that"
5724880,5734560," uh so yesu yesu yesu i'm gonna put it in here um how that function is going to look like uh right so"
5734560,5740720," let's actually call it bezier all right so and it's going to accept the t right which is understandable"
5741200,5750240," and it also probably will accept the nodes right so it will accept the nodes um right and let's say"
5750240,5755920," that the nodes is going to be four i know that it degrades to a pointer no need to tell me that thank"
5755920,5763360," you very much uh right and i suppose we can just like use the same formula that we did in here when we"
5763360,5772160," were rendering this entire stuff right so uh let me see um all right"
5772160,5784880," so and it is an inverse of t there we go and then we can just remove a return b so this is literally the"
5784880,5792080," the same formula we might as well actually use yeah we can use literally the same formula in here if"
5792080,5799840," yeah well why not right so busy uh busy we can even inline the whole we are inlining"
5799840,5811280," the whole and we do nodes and that's basically it right might as well okay all right all right all right"
5811280,5818800," so this is literally the same formula so to speak right and this is also the formula that gonna that"
5818800,5822320," is going to be used in animation right"
5831440,5835280," all right all right that's pretty cool so let's actually try to oh okay so i forgot a very important"
5835280,5841440," thing in here uh p just remove this the whole thing right so because uh it's parameterized by the"
5841440,5846640," nodes now uh so we have in here so return ah"
5849600,5856720," yeah yeah this one is a little bit painful because that's not how it works uh that's not"
5856720,5863040," how it works but we can actually return vector two okay so let's actually make it return vector two"
5863040,5869280," but in our case we're going to be using it as a time function we have to only take y right and this is"
5869280,5876160," why we must keep these things at zero zero right so that's why we have to keep them at zero zero otherwise"
5876160,5884000," it's not going to work right so this thing has to be zero so what's funny is that x of this parameter"
5884000,5890240," is not needed and x of this parameter also not needed we only care about their y's because their"
5890240,5897440," x's are snapped to zero and one anyway though not necessarily honestly uh what if we want to define"
5897440,5903840," shit like that right so what if something like that is also yeah i can see that so the only situations"
5903840,5911360," that we want to kind of forbid is this one right when a single uh right thing is sort of like goals"
5911360,5917200," maybe it's also fine honestly why am i putting all of these restrictions right so if this is the function"
5917200,5922080," that i want to have like let me just have that function like who the are you to tell me so"
5922080,5927840," yeah i didn't see any problems with that right so just like just allow this stuff just allow this stuff"
5928560,5935600," by the way i wonder if i can now do an opposite operation where i can uh control v"
5935600,5940960," into like an array into this thing and it will reset the nodes like that"
5940960,5945040," that sounds like a very interesting idea honestly"
5947680,5953600," but if like i have to like i have to can i scan f this mother flick the flipper"
5953600,5962880," okay can it can you just scan if it wait a second if is key uh pressed"
5962880,5969680," key v so it's get right so get clipboard"
5971760,5985200," oh my god okay so get clipboard uh so scan f um s why everything's so slow"
5989520,5994560," so string uh can i literally do that"
5994560,5998640," name"
5998640,6014240," so in scanf they they are supposed to be pointers right so i haven't used scanf for quite some time"
6014240,6024000," actually uh right so how do you scanf do you pass the pointers to scanf right if you want to modify"
6024000,6030480," the things chat i need your help for one time do you do like that yeah it's point to thank you thank"
6030480,6036560," you so much all right so now that means i have to go through all of these things"
6040000,6049760," and just oh fuck shit damn bro bro bro okay so it's fine chat everyone calm down everyone calm down"
6049760,6061600," come everyone come down all right so multiply axis length uh all right so can i just okay so i probably"
6061600,6069440," can do something like that uh all right so this is basically what i want"
6070480,6076640," all right all right all right so let's reload this entire stuff now uh it's probably gonna crash"
6076640,6081120," i'm pretty sure it's going to crash but i'm gonna copy paste this stuff like that and"
6081120,6091280," oh fuck oh oh my oh my god ah x kill x kill fast all right so"
6093280,6101680," uh it's not even dead jesus bruv okay kill this kill this okay so it's it's dead all right all right"
6101680,6112160," it's fine okay um so now uh let's not do that that it's kind of a cool idea but i just don't"
6112160,6117760," want to spend time like figuring out how to do all that it doesn't matter uh all right so now what i want"
6117760,6126960," to do i want to somehow tell my animation framework bruh use bezier code use bezier code"
6126960,6136880," how can i do that how can i do that and i want to be able to do that on a scaler"
6136880,6142240," right so first of all let me grab this and move it into the function with interpolator so i have a special"
6142240,6147760," module with interpolators and shit and this is what i wanted uh like to have it right so this is going"
6147760,6152880," to be static in line right so it's going to be shared between different things and stuff like that right"
6152880,6158960," so this is this is what it is by the way this is not just bizarre it's a cubic bizarre right so it's a"
6158960,6164880," cubic one and uh it's indicated by the fact that we accept four of these things right so it's a cubic"
6164880,6171520," busy so the only problem that i have in here is that we don't import array math right so let's actually"
6171520,6181760," try to import ray math and see how bad it's all going to be so it's a cubic cubic uh it doesn't have it"
6181760,6189040," because we have to actually import interpolator i think it's there's multiple of them okay there we go"
6189040,6197200," that's cool it's kind of a default reads from stdin didn't i use ah i thought i did s scanner i thought"
6197200,6203360," i thought i did s scanner did i forgot extra s i think i forgot extra s i already removed the code i'm"
6203360,6211040," sorry i'll try to do that next time uh right so sorry about that sorry sorry sorry uh yeah okay god"
6211040,6221280," damn it all right so i'm gonna do uh so uh isu isu isu i'm gonna sneeze by the way chat get ready"
6221280,6234080," do you wait it uh so um how we're gonna be approaching all of that so i want to go into the tm.c um and um what"
6234080,6246320," we want to have actually i probably want to copy paste uh move back to data right so i'm gonna"
6246320,6255440," literally copy paste that where is the place where i define custom yeah here they are so here we are move"
6255440,6263840," back to busy right so and what we're going to be doing here instead of using interp"
6263840,6273600," func we're going to be using actually a bunch of nodes for nodes uh like this um so yeah i don't"
6273600,6279680," really know how to incorporate that into the system of interpolation function they already have right"
6279680,6285520," because of that i'm going to have a separate sort of like a data thing uh okay that's very cool uh now i"
6285520,6296880," need to have something like um move vector to uh emacs shut the fuck up emac busy update uh so in here we're"
6296880,6306240," going to be accepting the data and also the environment so let me maybe copy paste the implementation so it's"
6306240,6315280," going to be task c move back to update where is the implementation okay so there is an internal weight"
6315280,6322080," uh wait uh wait task right so this thing kind of inherits the weight task so because of that it just"
6322080,6328160," has an internal thing in here so if it's already done we also declare that task done so this is"
6328160,6335680," basically a call to a super class right it's a call to a super class so if the task has not started"
6336240,6343680," all right we initializing everything in here we initializing then we are updating the internal task"
6343680,6351840," we are updating the internal task uh right and then if the the target like the thing that we want to"
6351840,6360400," modify is set we're lurping from the start to the target using this interpolation function but here is the catch"
6360640,6368240," right here is the catch now we have to use a cubic bezier interpolator we provide the interpolator here"
6368240,6375360," and as a bezier definition we are using data nodes maybe i should call it bezier right so i think it would"
6375360,6382560," be better to call it bezier instead right so that's how we're going to be doing all that that's literally"
6382560,6386880," how we're going to be doing that but here is the thing this motherfucker returns your vector"
6386880,6396560," so what we have to do we have to use y right so i think i think that makes sense in that particular"
6396560,6402560," regard we would just use y uh and that thing would interpolate everything properly and then we just return"
6402560,6410560," finish so there we go so here is the um implementation of this class that uses bezier curve"
6410560,6418400," for interpolations right so that's what it does so we defined the uh the data of the class right and we"
6418400,6424400," define the update method now we have to do the constructor right so let's actually do the constructor"
6424400,6430000," we need to construct this entire thing uh all right so we need to create a function that returns this data"
6430000,6436320," let's actually call it just the name of the class right so and in here i suppose it has to"
6437280,6444960," uh accept all of the stuff that the move uh yeah so it have to accept the value that we're modifying"
6444960,6450720," it has to may i actually move my camera a little bit down so you can see so we have to accept the"
6450720,6455120," value the target the duration and here we accept interpolation function but we're going to be accepting"
6455120,6462800," bezier right so let me grab that so we're going to have that and then we're going to say vector two ah"
6463840,6468240," bezier so there's going to be four of them and what we're going to be doing in here we're going to just"
6468240,6474320," return this kind of thing like so uh so what we have to initialize in here so"
6474320,6485440," yeah so this is basically the things we're doing we are calling to a constructor of the super class"
6485440,6490640," providing the duration then we set the value and the target and here we have to provide and this is very"
6490640,6496720," interesting point so i don't think it's not going to work like that right so we literally have to do"
6496720,6505040," mem copy right i think that's what we'll have to do so let me quickly do something like this"
6505040,6512160," right so it's going to be data we're not going to do that but what we're going to do is uh we're going"
6512160,6516480," to take the data we're going to use bezier so this is the destination the source is this one"
6517280,6524160," and then we're going to say the size is the size of this whole thing right and then we return the data"
6524160,6528720," uh jeffrey bezier former ceo"
6528720,6535040," that's written all right so we created the constructor of the data but the data of the"
6535040,6541680," class is not useful we need to wrap it into a task that is allocated in the arena somewhere there"
6542240,6550000," that's what we have to do so um what i'm going to do i'm going to create move vector to it's actually"
6550000,6559680," task move uh vector to bezier all right so it's going to accept all of these things in here as usual"
6559680,6567120," as usual but it's going to return the task instead and on top of that it's also going to accept arena"
6567840,6572480," where it's going to allocate all of that right so what we're going to do is we're going to just"
6572480,6583680," construct this data as usual uh right so it's going to be data uh and we just do stuff like that value"
6583680,6592320," target duration bezier right and we need to return the task so the first thing we have to provide in"
6592320,6600000," the task is the tag we don't have a tag for that stuff yet right so task move back to vector to"
6600000,6605680," bezier tag we'll have to register that thing and then the data right so we're going to do we're going"
6605680,6611360," to actually take that data that we constructed in here and we're going to actually move it into arena"
6611360,6617840," so memdup data actually arena pointed to the data and then the size of the data so that will allocate"
6617840,6623040," enough uh memory in the arena we're going to move the entire data into there and then we just return"
6623040,6628080," this entire task so we now have a task and stuff like that we try to build this entire"
6628080,6636400," mem copy is not found uh so this is not a pointer i see i see oh yeah but why is this not a pointer what"
6636400,6641680," the is this it's supposed to be a pointer bro bro bro i see i did a"
6641680,6649440," walkie walkie my friend okay so what else do we have in here mem copy uh expected okay so semicolon"
6649440,6654880," that's fine what else do we have in here we don't have this tag we don't have this tag so we need to"
6654880,6660960," actually allocate this tag in here and uh let's actually find the tag so this is where we are"
6660960,6668560," registering all of these mother flippers like so task vtable register right and this is going to be task"
6668560,6677680," funks and what we're doing here is just update uh move uh scalar uh what was the move vector to"
6677680,6686240," uh bz update right so that's basically what we're doing here right so this is that one and we just do"
6686240,6692080," it like that so that's basically it cool finally we created a class"
6694240,6703520," uh so we created a class what uh we need to do now we need to use that thing somewhere"
6703520,6710640," right we need to use that thing somewhere i want to use it when we highlight the uh you know the symbols"
6710640,6718560," right so let's actually go back into uh the uh turing machine animation right so this is going to build"
6718560,6726800," leap tm uh like so um i actually have to do it like that probably uh-huh boom all right so let's take a"
6726800,6732720," look at all that stuff uh-huh so as you can see they're like these things sort of bump up right you"
6732720,6738880," can see them right so you can see them bumping up so i want them to overshoot a little bit and then go"
6738880,6744960," back so that's what i want to do so their interpolators that is responsible for their size"
6744960,6751760," right uh is called i think bump yeah there we go so we have a rule which is an array of symbols and"
6751760,6758960," they have corresponding bumps uh where do we use bumps in here so here they are so for the bumps what"
6758960,6767120," we're doing we are essentially yeah so we're just interpolating them like that so which is understandable"
6767760,6774080," uh so we actually use them in so many different places so what i'm thinking is that maybe it would"
6774080,6781520," be nice to factor them out somehow uh but maybe not uh what we can do we can do a little bit of this"
6781520,6789120," kind of stuff move uh oh i just realized that i'm a wacky wacky idiot"
6792320,6799360," damn so this should not be vector 2 this this is supposed to be scalar all right that's very easy"
6799360,6806560," to fix honestly right uh so it's going to be just a mechanical substitution of like vector 2 and scalar"
6806560,6812560," all right it's fine everything's fine chat calm down everyone calm down so this is just vector 2"
6812560,6818480," uh scalar right so it's going to be just like that and we just mechanically substitute this okay"
6819040,6825120," okay don't tell anybody don't freaking tell anybody that i did such a wacky wacky"
6825120,6832480," don't tell anybody okay so it's not a vector it's actually scalar uh right so i also want to"
6832480,6840400," quickly replace vector 2 to float essentially yeah this one is weird i'm gonna skip it for now so this is"
6840400,6848000," just floats not the bezier all right so the bezier has to stay vector 2 actually believe it or not it has"
6848000,6856800," to stay vector 2. uh right and this one has to be just a lerp all right so let's actually see uh and"
6856800,6863360," if we rebuild this entire stuff is it going to okay so there's some stuff in here um cubic bezier"
6863360,6874000," is not compatible but yeah so this has to be vector 2 that's understandable what else do we have in here okay"
6874000,6882800," so let me find the tags so this one has to be uh scalar all right and there's the last one that"
6882800,6891600," is not compatible scalar uh and this one is also scalar all right looks good look gucci looks"
6891600,6897440," fucking tamaguchi okay cool so let's find the bumps let's find the bumps so what i want to do is move"
6897440,6904560," scalar bezier all right and we want to in terms of bezier we want to define it somewhere here so this is"
6904560,6913920," going to be vector bezier 4 and uh let me find the definition of that curve that we created right so"
6913920,6920800," we created a tool and here is the curve right and that's the curve we want to use honestly right so that's"
6920800,6927040," the curve we want to use uh we're going to just put bezier in here so let's see if this entire thing"
6927040,6932480," is going to compile uh it doesn't fucking compile because why so yeah so we have to get rid of the"
6932480,6939840," function pulse all right i wonder if we can use a little bit of um emacs magic if you know what i'm"
6939840,6946640," talking about to sort of update all of these things in here so every time we sort of yeah so these things"
6946640,6955600," are basically the same uh right so that means i can just go like that and use bezier then go on the"
6955600,6962720," other side then go a little bit in here and then replace ellipse everything with bezier so now for all"
6962720,6969360," of the bumps if we take a look at them uh right so bump if we iterate through all of them they're using"
6969360,6978560," the bezier curve shit uh yep so that's pretty cool hopefully that will actually work all right i'm gonna"
6978560,6988640," refresh and let's see uh-huh update okay so let's slow down"
6997840,6998960," all right all right so something"
6998960,7003600," what the fuck"
7003600,7010240," what the fuck is going on"
7010240,7019600," i love it"
7028560,7031440," epic epic epic epic epic all right"
7031440,7036320," we implemented bezier curves thanks everyone for watching"
7036320,7042880," so yeah that's kind of interesting that's kind of interesting"
7047680,7051920," way the fuck what the fuck what the fuck is this why is this minus one"
7051920,7060880," freaking"
7060880,7068400," all right so the the why shit let's fucking why shit"
7069840,7073680," um yeah coordinate system coordinate system"
7073680,7082240," me in the ass yet again why they keep me in the ass yet again bruh bruh bruh bruh"
7082240,7092480," okay let's let's try to construct a different curve yet again okay so we uh we have bezier right so let's go"
7093920,7100880," um um so we kind of want this kind of thing and another thing that over shoots that's what we want"
7100880,7109120," roughly uh not that much but i mean kind of uh yeah a little bit overshoots"
7109120,7116400," so and obviously this shit is not correct uh right so um this is the second one"
7117120,7124400," and it has like a minus so maybe what we have to do is just get rid of the negative i suppose"
7124400,7131760," yeah so just like invert the negative so i think it's easy to fix relatively uh just"
7131760,7139920," invert the negative and that's gonna be it i think yeah maybe that will fix it we'll see we'll see"
7140960,7145680," um so be zero um where is"
7145680,7153920," task yeah so here it is we don't even have to do it like that all right let's get rid of the minus"
7153920,7164800," let's get rid of the minus because yeah so in if i yeah so it's it's basically their equivalent in that"
7164800,7175760," okay so let's reveal everything and let's take a look at the uh turn machine all right let me have"
7175760,7190960," finally enough there's something like why does it doesn't really go all the way through like what's up with"
7190960,7197760," that i don't get it like why doesn't go all the way through it's it's kind of did the thing okay"
7197760,7201360," so but it doesn't go all the way through"
7201360,7208080," so i kind of expected to"
7208080,7211760," actually do that but it didn't do that"
7211760,7214720," so let's see"
7218240,7222000," all right all right it just it keeps growing and it even went a little bit down"
7222000,7228160," right it even went a little bit down but then it didn't fully finish so there's something"
7228160,7237200," um wrong about maybe we have to detect that we're finished and we have to set it to one or something"
7237200,7243520," um yeah so let's find where we do the update"
7245440,7250560," yeah i suppose when we are finished right so we updated this entire stuff"
7250560,7257680," we take the t and is that t even"
7257680,7266560," well let's do the following thing uh that and if finished"
7269040,7279120," if finished can we just like simply set this entire stuff to literally like one right so if we reach"
7279120,7285360," the finished state just hard code it to one it's it's kind of a hack but i mean maybe it will help"
7285360,7294640," uh maybe it will help it we'll see we'll see uh all right so we're lurping from that to that and we're"
7295680,7303280," using one right so that should work i think right so that i think should work uh okay okay"
7303280,7308400," no it doesn't do"
7308400,7320560," why that is bizarre honestly uh because the same sort of like a function it's supposed to do that"
7321120,7328480," all right so let's explore that function then be zero and what's wrong with it uh what's wrong with that"
7328480,7337520," specific function uh we may wanna do some sort of like a bezier test see uh bizarre curve yeah exactly"
7338320,7343040," so let's include maybe ray math ray math and stuff like that"
7343040,7351520," and so this is this and let's just return brazil curve"
7351520,7360400," uh okay so yeah what i want to do is essentially just go from zero to"
7361280,7368240," 13 right so maybe we can actually say that this is a resolution 13. uh i just want to see how it looks"
7368240,7374880," like all right i just want to see how it looks like so then i have like a float to uh float i"
7374880,7381600," divided by res and then we can so we want to also interpolate us and that includes ray math as well"
7382320,7397600," uh we can do f um f all right and uh yeah so this is t uh cubic bezier uh we provide the t and the bezier"
7397600,7406720," all right so that's cool so we also want to put the new line here um so we probably have to do some some"
7406720,7415360," shits with the path because i can't just build bezier test bezier test c because it doesn't see"
7415360,7424880," interpolators right so um we can do src right so and ray math we can do ray uh leap emacs please"
7424880,7433280," auto complete stuff for me input all right let's go so what do you want from me asserts okay so include"
7433280,7439920," the cert well i mean we probably want to include the certs in the interpolators themselves okay and"
7439920,7449440," then here we want to do stdio so please okay um so that means we have to link oh my god okay so can i"
7449440,7456880," add that to knob or something is that is there any easy way for for me to edit with knob uh i can probably"
7456880,7463360," build a build nxz uh all right so yeah i think i can build an exe very easily so let's let's quickly do"
7463360,7476320," that um so build bezier test nsrc actually not nsrc but somewhere here bezier test c that should be enough"
7476320,7482880," i think all right apparently i have all of the necessary machinery to build all of that stuff interpolator"
7482880,7497120," to see um so it doesn't include um build exe we may want to actually include uh-huh i see what's going"
7497120,7508800," on um so maybe what we want to do in here is just include src into the include path i think that might"
7508800,7515680," work work for us okay so that's cool and in here what we're using we're using y all right so that's also"
7515680,7525280," very cool all right so uh let me now try to run all of that stuff so bezier test okay"
7528160,7540480," so that's uh i think i know what the fuck because bump freaking bump it's it's it's a problem with my"
7540480,7549840," setup bump is an additional size so because of that because of that it has to go back to zero so that's"
7549840,7557760," i'm just being immediate everything works as intended everything works as intended but yeah so this is how the"
7558640,7564160," uh the bezier curve goes right so it goes back to one so everything's fine everything's fine chat"
7564160,7571680," everything's fine so let's go back to the bezier curve uh application uh right so let me try to maybe run it"
7572240,7585520," um so leap bezier busy all right so i think i want to clamp the first and the last node as i see bezier"
7585520,7594640," let's find the first and the last node so if you're dragging around um after dragging like always after"
7594640,7603760," dragging what i want to do i want to take the uh last node so the first node nodes"
7610800,7619920," i need an easy way to just set yeah maybe it doesn't matter whatever so this is what i roughly want"
7619920,7629680," this is what i roughly want and then yeah i need to actually zoom out a little bit"
7633360,7637280," where is the zoom can i put half of this thing"
7637280,7643360," uh-huh yeah there we go that's what i want"
7643360,7654160," isn't that cool how i can just zoom out like that i think that's pretty cool uh right and like i don't"
7654160,7658400," have a zoom out functionality in my application but i can just like hot reload the thing"
7658400,7667520," all right so if i take this thing um i need to get rid of all the minuses"
7667520,7674480," uh right so this is the minus this is another minus and this one probably has to be just zero"
7674480,7681040," right so in terms of like y it is zero in terms of x i would actually set it to one right so i can"
7681040,7686000," always adjust this kind of things manually and this is our new curve right this is our new curve"
7686000,7697600," um yeah but to be fair yeah i actually wanted to use curve not on the bumps but on the cell switches"
7697600,7702880," okay so that's i already tired right right so already the stream for almost three hours and i'm"
7702880,7708480," starting to confuse things so please forgive me so we still need the previous one we still need to use"
7708480,7715600," the previous one but we need to apply it on the um only cell switches right so what that's what we"
7715600,7719520," have to do in here we have to apply it on the cell switches so that explains it actually"
7719520,7727360," all right so let's take a look at the uh tm so let's get maybe get rid of the"
7729360,7733920," of the bezier curves in all of the bezier curves in all of these places right so we don't really need them"
7733920,7743840," in here honestly so i can probably select all of that stuff uh yeah there we go so there's a watermark"
7743840,7749840," that's fine um so i want to use this bezier curve in"
7749840,7759280," right head that's where i want to use it okay so let's find the definition of right head"
7759280,7771280," right head where is the constructor okay so when we are writing the head we're using weight data okay that's"
7771280,7779920," very interesting actually uh we are using okay so we are actually doing all this stuff directly so that"
7779920,7786640," means i can kind of do a little bit of a trick in here so i can do bezier and just do it like that"
7786640,7792080," all right so that actually makes it super easy to just start using it in uh in right head"
7793520,7800720," okay so cubic bezier cubic bezier and what else do we have in here so what you don't like it's because"
7800720,7809120," it's a vector okay so let's take y um all right so let's close this thing man this is kind of makes"
7809120,7813840," panim some sort of a platform because the animations could be like separate applications that are useful"
7813840,7821600," for different cases what if we allow panim run several animations at once and basically switch between them"
7823600,7828480," so that would be kind of cool so i'm working on one animation i loaded up the bezier curve editor"
7828480,7835040," i switched to it quickly updated my bezier curve switch it back to my animation and maybe i can have like"
7835040,7839200," several of them maybe even like a list so the the whole thing becomes sort of sort of like a supervisor"
7839200,7846960," for these applications and stuff like that that is so cool um can you make panim a code editor that"
7846960,7853760," will be also kind of interesting right so yo this like this turns into like a platform and what the"
7853760,7861360," so the system that loads elf files panim is now yeah it's an operating system"
7861360,7867760," right i turned my animation framework into operating operating you guys asked me to develop an operating"
7867760,7873840," system there you go here's the operating system there you go operating system isn't it cool i think that's"
7873840,7880240," pretty freaking cool anyways uh so i i wonder how is exactly is it going to go um"
7880240,7889840," uh yesu yesu yesu kawaii freaking this i am afraid that if i overshoot this switching of the cell"
7889840,7895200," okay so cell i have a notion of the cell listen listen chat this is actually very important so this"
7895200,7903680," should we shut my fuck up cell you you saw how when the cell switches it switches from one symbol to"
7903680,7909600," another this is the structure that does that you have symbol a and symbol b and t basically interpolates"
7909600,7916320," from one symbol to another one symbol a symbol b right so if t is equal to zero a symbol a is displayed"
7916320,7922240," if t equal to one symbol b is displayed and it does this uh pretty cool interpolation between them"
7922800,7930400," i have a feeling that if t becomes greater than one um symbol a may start actually inverting itself so it's"
7930400,7932160," going to look like shit so"
7932160,7941600," let's see i'm just i'm just warning you that it might look like shit right just warning just a friendly"
7941600,7947680," reminder that this shit may look like shit uh okay so let's see all right so let's slow down"
7947680,7961200," that looked fine noticed how it does overshooting and then brings back look so i'm gonna slow down"
7961200,7970960," the time look it grows bigger and then goes back all right so it reduces okay so it switches the state and"
7970960,7976560," shit like that right whatever right it goes into that then it overshoots a little bit and then goes back"
7976560,7982560," we achieved that through a custom bezier curve"
7982560,7987520," we achieved that through a custom bezier curve"
7987520,7994400," right so i don't i don't know if it actually made the animation look a little bit better so let's actually see it at full speed"
7995520,8007040," it looks a little bit better but now i have more control well no i didn't use a bezier curve for"
8007040,8012080," switching the state i think uh all right so let me see how i'm switching the state"
8013040,8019680," so there's a plug uh plug reset not really plug reset but uh let me see let me see so yeah this is"
8019680,8026720," and i'm i'm just writing yeah so there is a task right cell so there's a more generic task to do this"
8026720,8033840," kind of shit okay so right seller yeah okay let's copy paste a little bit more uh more copy pasting chat"
8033840,8038640," more copy pasting uh where is that um"
8038640,8046720," so right had updates uh here it is"
8046720,8056240," uh-huh i got you mother flip i got you got you hyper all right so this is what we can do now so i think"
8056240,8064240," hopefully it will actually start doing some cool shy so what the is this okay uh it's actually data"
8064240,8071440," cell i suppose yeah it's a data cell but data cell is confirmed we don't even check whether the data"
8071440,8078080," cell is available or no maybe we should but whatever uh-huh okay so that's that's fine"
8079920,8084400," uh data cell all right let's go"
8084400,8093920," so it's needed for this state right so we used um the overshooting for the"
8093920,8097120," for the cell uh but we also need to use it in here as well"
8097120,8103920," okay so this is the most interesting part so let's actually see that in slow motion"
8109920,8116560," uh they kind of synchronized a little bit of a tweaking required for uh them to be you didn't see"
8116560,8123680," shit by the way i just realized yeah so i'm trying to synchronize these two uh holes right so let me try"
8123680,8126800," to do that one more time um okay"
8137040,8141520," yeah so i was trying to synchronize two holes to sort of land down at the same time"
8141520,8146800," that's what i was trying to do and i think i'm kind of there uh maybe i should use a custom curve"
8146800,8153680," for the hold as well yeah it's kind of close it looks better but a little bit of it we can still"
8153680,8161920," require a little bit of a tweaking so it's probably very obvious that they kind of out of sync in a slow"
8161920,8170880," motion let's do the slow motion uh-huh so this is that uh-huh and let's go"
8170880,8180000," yeah you could see that there was a little bit out of sync but maybe it's when it's fast it's kind of"
8180000,8188080," fine probably yeah so but at least now i have a mechanism that allows me to edit those bezier curves"
8188800,8194880," uh all right so and i have more control over how i play all of these animations and stuff like that"
8194880,8200720," so i probably need to bring this zoom much a little bit closer right so where is the zoom so it's actually"
8200720,8206880," makes something like eight uh right so and it's a little bit closer so this is what we developed on"
8206880,8212480," today's stream right so we have a custom bezier curve uh editor and stuff like that that we can use in"
8212480,8217440," animations i'm going to polish it up right so there's some things that i would like to add to this entire"
8217440,8224960," stuff all right but overall i think it works fine i think it works fine for now so uh thank you so"
8224960,8231040," much julian9601 thank you thank you thank you all right so today was a pretty cool stream i think"
8231040,8235840," thanks everyone who's watching right now i really appreciate that have a good one and see you all on"
8235840,8239760," the next recreation programming session with a mr zozin i love you all"
8239760,8240320," Mwah."
