0,6400," guys guys language keeps improving as you use it it's it's just like right in front of your eyes"
6400,11040," magically becoming better and better and better you don't even have to wait for releases or"
11040,16480," anything it's amazing can your zig do that can your audience do that i don't think so"
16480,22000," can you see do that but the c can't even finally finalize the embed thingy they still don't have"
22000,25680," it finally maybe they already have it finalized but i don't really know but i mean it's so slow"
25680,33760," this thing right in front of us getting better all right chat chat chat chat chat chat do you"
33760,42320," remember this little thing uh the panim my attempt at implementing my name but in c and it went quite"
42320,48880," successfully right so i just didn't have motivation to uh to sort of like make a video out of that but"
48880,54800," maybe at some point i'm going to resume my work on that so panim is essentially i consist of just a"
54800,62320," single executable right and a bunch of dll's and each animation is a dll sort of like a plugin that"
62320,67680," you run with the executable that is an engine uh right so if you build this entire thing you're going"
67680,72880," to end up with something like this right so in a project in the project we have the executable the"
72880,79440," engine itself and a bunch of so's right so i only developed it for linux potentially it may work on"
79440,84800," windows but i never really tested it there uh i don't remember if i use anything linux specific well"
84800,89600," i mean i do use linux specific dll stuff right so but i mean it's equivalent to something that you can"
89600,95200," find in twin api anyway so it shouldn't be that big of an issue to port that to windows right and the way"
95200,102960," you actually work with that is essentially you run panim right and it expects you to provide the dll or so"
102960,108800," so so and uh the animation we can provide in here is uh for example something like this so here is the"
108800,114320," turing machine the animation for a turing machine so it looks like this right and it even has sounds"
114320,121440," look at that it even has cells and it's all procedurally generated it is all procedure generated i"
121440,127680," can actually stop this entire thing i can speed up and or slow down uh there's some other things"
127680,134240," look at that i think it's adaptable even to to some extent well i mean yeah not really uh right and i"
134240,139440," think there is some ways to generate videos out of that so i don't remember all of the keys i should"
139440,147600," have implemented something that actually shows all of the keys um so yeah i think i think it's something"
147600,155840," like render maybe it's the key just r but it's kind of hard to tell yeah there we go so uh rendering"
155840,164960," so if we're currently rendering with not rendering uh yeah so it's essentially r if you press r it will"
164960,170800," start actually rendering a video uh right and it will render it using i'm pretty sure yeah it's just"
170800,176080," using ff impact so it's just like piping all of that stuff into ff impact uh i don't know how long it's"
176080,181760," going to do that it's doing it relatively slowly probably because the the frames are generated really"
181760,186640," slowly so essentially what we do we just render this entire thing into the into the frame buffer"
186640,191680," right and then uh just pipe in all of the frames into ff impact and it's already done uh right so"
191680,198160," here's the video and then you can use that video in the video editor right so it's it's mp4 uh right so"
198160,204240," it doesn't include the sounds apparently maybe maybe i forgot to enable that but anyways so it also"
204240,211040," supposed to include the sounds right and the thing is uh on one of the previous stream i think it was"
211040,218160," like literally the last stream the literally the previous stream uh we were working on futures in c3"
218160,227600," right so it's already on youtube as far as i know uh so sodding daily futures uh right so it's it's this one"
227600,234640," it's it's this video um right and we implemented it quite successfully so the uh abstractions and the"
234640,241840," features of c3 make it relatively easy to implement your own futures and funny things i already oh yeah"
241840,250480," so here it is uh futures in c3 video right so and here is by the way the um you know the source code of the"
250480,256160," futures we will need it actually in here we'll need it in here so the way we implemented the um"
256160,265280," the animation we actually implemented something resembling futures but in pure c right because"
265280,270080," this is a rather complicated animation if you look at that right it's a rather complicated mission"
270080,276880," there's a lot of things in here going on uh right and a lot of things that are parallel and stuff like that"
276880,281760," and some of the things that are similar to each other and the way we implemented that we introduced"
281760,289680," the notion of a task right and a task is something that you have to pull on each frame"
289680,299120," so and essentially you can have several tasks in parallel uh right for example just right now these"
299120,306240," things started to uh like have an effect and this thing went up these are two separate tasks that"
306240,313280," that are pulled simultaneously and animated simultaneously right so and this is how the"
313280,319360," entire animation is composed it's composed out of these tasks that act like futures that we implemented"
319360,326720," on the previous stream so uh which led me to an idea can i just use c3 because doing futures like"
326720,331840," that in pure c it's kind of a pain in the in the ass right i remember that being pain in the ass"
332960,342080," um so let me find some tasks uh yeah there we go here's the some task right so and essentially you"
342080,347360," have tasks like right head move head which is the head of the turing machine and stuff like that you"
347360,352000," you can combine them sequentially and stuff like that and you just like combine this ast and it's kind of"
352000,358000," painful in all honesty it's kind of painful um and this is because you can't really implement"
358000,364080," proper future in c syntactically at least it's kind of difficult so i thought maybe i can just do"
364080,370960," that in c3 and see if it's comfortable or not luckily since the animations are basically dll's you"
370960,376000," can implement animations in whatever language you want right you can implement them in whatever you"
376000,382800," want whatever language allows you to create a dll with a c call convention you can just use that right"
382800,390400," so essentially c is a lingua franca of programming world everything is c whether you like it or not"
390400,398320," underneath everything is just c right so c is the programming language of planet earth"
400240,403840," and i'm not trying to diss anyone or whatever it's just like i'm stating facts"
403840,411040," this is just a fact right if if the fact defends you sorry so c is the programming language of planet"
411040,416400," earth it's too late to change anything so and because of that i think we even had some of the"
416400,422240," animations written in c plus plus didn't we i don't remember actually i think at some point we tried to"
422240,426960," do that but i don't remember if i actually committed any of it oh yeah there we go so we have a"
426960,433520," yeah so we even implemented sort of like tasks in c plus plus there we go and they're also pollable look"
433520,438400," at that so here is the update with the environment and stuff like that there you go there you go"
438400,443200," and it's actually a little bit more comfortable in c plus plus i think"
444160,451440," yeah the way you construct them uh is here is your sort of like a um you know tasks and you combine"
451440,455920," them sequentially and they do different things in here right they just do different things so this"
455920,461600," is in c plus plus and then it's compiled to to dll and everything we can even try to to run this kind"
461600,471440," of stuff so uh i think it's just libprobe uh there we go oh yeah okay oh i i accidentally rendered it"
471440,476400," i don't remember how to restart it so does anybody remember how to restart it but yeah there we go so"
476400,480560," you can implement this kind of stuff in in c plus plus so you need this sort of like a native language"
480560,487920," that can compile to dll and can also work with the radio so which means c3 could be uh potentially a good"
487920,494640," candidate so the only problem i think i remember from the c plus plus is that it was it was not"
494640,502400," possible to hot reload uh virtual methods because remember why because remember why so like this thing"
502400,509600," has virtual methods that's for sure and uh you can't just hot reload the dll dll is also supposed to"
509600,519920," store the state of the animation right and um essentially um the objects i think they stored"
519920,528480," like a pointers within the virtual table and the virtual table was within um within the dll and if"
528480,535360," you reload the dll the virtual table sort of point has become invalid right so and because of that you"
535360,542560," you couldn't hold to reload the c plus plus as far as i know c3 interfaces and dynamic methods are also"
542560,549600," kind of implemented like uh you know virtual tables and the question is will c3 actually survive the hot"
549600,555760," reloading of panim see if i remember correctly it was long time ago i think c plus plus couldn't survive"
555760,562160," that but c3 i don't know how exactly it is implemented maybe it can so the only way as far as i can understand to"
562160,570800," survive uh hot reload is to be able to patch up the virtual uh the virtual table right so and you can't"
570800,576640," do that in c plus plus because the exact implementation of the virtual table is sort of like a implementation"
576640,581280," specific right so you it's it's not standardized the the compilers can do whatever the they want"
581920,591520," and uh so does c3 have any access to its virtual table or whatever mechanism it is using that's a"
591520,598960," good question that i would like to maybe answer try to answer today so sounds good sounds gucci sounds"
598960,604640," tamaguchi let's go so the question is how the do you create a dll in c3 i have no idea"
604640,611440," right so i think this is the first thing that we're going to try to do c3 uh so dll right so let's"
611440,616800," actually go ahead so if i create like hello world uh right we're going to start with the hello world just"
616800,621920," to check that the latest version of the compiler that we pulled recently still works it still twerks"
621920,630960," and all the jazz uh print a fan uh print a fan and i'm gonna say hello world right and uh i didn't"
630960,638080," really have to return anything c3c compile run main c3 there we go and the question is how the"
638080,645600," fuck do you even generate a dll do you have anything about that in the help for instance"
645600,651120," so something about the library okay so you can any lib um right so"
651120,659280," so there is a lib name i suppose what we have to do uh-huh so library"
659280,665280," it's a link with the library uh-huh"
665280,675200," so maybe shared um initialize a new library structure"
676320,681040," so you can actually maybe create the project i don't like this init command chat"
681040,690080," i really don't like this init command so you just do init and test right and it generates you a huge"
690080,695600," slope of a template project that includes literally everything everything that this entire thing"
695600,704320," supports and it's just like ew brother ew like it can be potentially probably very simple and very like"
704320,709440," you know tidy and neat and stuff like that but it's just like i don't know what i can remove from here"
709440,714480," like why the fuck do you give me everything it's just like no this is just like scary look at this like"
714480,720240," get away from me like i don't want to even look into that so and i suppose"
721760,728720," yeah so you can build libraries right so but you have to do that through their slope of"
728720,730320," seriously"
730320,738160," what the fuck like i don't need i'm not gonna be compiling for freebsd i'm not gonna be compiling for"
738160,743200," risk 5 like why do you give me all of that like this is not a good way to introduce users to your build"
743200,750240," system like this is not a good way to introduce that right so you just don't dump everything on"
750240,757280," the user who doesn't know how to use your build you just don't do that you have to introduce that"
757280,763040," incrementally slowly right it's just like it doesn't make me want to use that right i just want to build"
763040,769760," the library bro like i'm not gonna be playing it like mac os a arch are you serious scripts you need"
769760,776400," some script it just like it looks like a slope it's it's it's not a good look like i'm pretty sure"
776400,782400," uh learner actually values simplicity as much as i do like i know that he's a great software engineer"
782400,787200," with a lot of experience like i understand how he views that but it's just like another great way to"
787200,792080," introduce the user to to your build system and i'm pretty sure it's it's very simple but it's"
792080,797280," just like i don't see that just show me the simplicity or so far i just see a slope dumped"
797280,806000," onto me it's just nah nah nah nah get away from me um right so and because of that i just like"
806000,814080," try to move away to compile right so maybe we can i was using compile run maybe maybe just compile"
814080,821920," right maybe just compile and right away i don't see how to create the library right so"
821920,831120," you can compile but maybe you can do something like okay c minus c right it's not mine c okay library"
831120,840240," oh i see okay okay okay compile files without the project into a dynamic perfect perfect this is what"
840240,849920," i'm talking about this is what i'm talking about dynamic lib main c3 okay fail to find c runtime at link time"
851120,861120," okay okay okay how when was the last time anybody tried this command by the way"
861120,867680," when was the last time anybody tried this come does anybody use this command ever"
868320,880320," uh so main dot a okay okay okay okay so let's try one more time but with a passion"
880320,890080," just a simple hello world simply doesn't work and it doesn't even explain to you how like what exactly you"
890080,898960," did wrong it tells you i i couldn't link anything sorry so it wants a c runtime okay let's link with c"
898960,905840," this is not how we link with c okay so a link with the library provided okay so maybe the the thing i have"
905840,916800," to do in here is just like a c um i have no idea something is broken in this specific part of the compiler and i suspect"
916800,923440," you do not that many people using it so i suppose all the people just uh compiling executables and stuff"
923440,924480," like that is just like"
924480,934320," uh zlc maybe maybe this is what we have to do in here and it didn't help okay something apparently broken"
934320,942960," all right so but we are engineers we're not afraid of that uh dynamic libraries do you have anything"
943680,947840," library packaging okay so library packaging how it works"
947840,956160," so this is mac os i'm not a mac os user i'm sorry i don't care"
956160,968320," i'm sure it is simple i'm sure it is simple but i see i think c3 just fall into the same trap of as swift"
968960,978400," right instead of showing off its simplicity and being proud of it like loud and proud of"
978400,985680," simplicity here you go this is how you make a dll with a single command they go this oh here's everything"
985680,995200," that this can think do figure it out figure it out yourself like bro bro bro bro bro don't make me so"
995200,1003120," disappointed don't make me so disappointed uh um so anyway"
1003120,1008720," how can we approach that like i don't even know what is going on and what exactly doesn't want what"
1008720,1015920," that exactly doesn't even mean so what if i just get rid of the io io like i'm getting rid of the io"
1015920,1024080," completely right i'm removing everything uh related to just o right so uh okay so it also generates a"
1024080,1030000," bunch of c i suppose maybe to use a c as the a sort of like a backend or something and if i try to just"
1030000,1039360," make a dll okay still didn't work okay oh boy uh so do i have to"
1040880,1046480," no standard library no there was something about like a no libc do you guys remember"
1046480,1050400," do do you guys remember like libc"
1050400,1058480," oh okay so what if i just say bro do not link with libc right do not link with libc"
1058480,1067600," no uh c3 uh unable to find library how does that make any sense so there is an issue where you can see"
1067600,1074880," some of the available commands regarding crt std issue so it's not even fixed yet i didn't expect"
1074880,1079680," to encounter some unfixed compiler bug just work doing a simple thing"
1079680,1088320," okay so i'm trying to build a dynamic library from c3 just as we are trying to do that and then link it"
1088320,1093680," with c3 executable the executable is compiled and linked successfully but hangs in the indefinitely"
1093680,1102960," this is not our case right so this is not our case uh okay so this is just a compiler uh links here"
1102960,1112720," like how am i supposed to know this thing um crt dear why can't i just do dynamic lib and just"
1112720,1117760," fucking build it without knowing any of this flag or anything like that i'm not using any special"
1117760,1124240," environment like wasm or anything like that why can't i just dynamic lib and just get the dynamic link"
1124240,1131520," i don't understand this is a bug use it this is a usability bug this is a usability bug how are you"
1131520,1141680," supposed to replace c if you just like what the excuse me um bro bro bro this has to be fixed asap"
1141680,1150480," this has to be fixed asap this is a like unacceptable anyways um so if i try to build c3 so let's take a look"
1150480,1161040," at what this thing does uh crt win 30 linux 30 set the directory to set bro like i mean it's it's the"
1161040,1168960," same literally everywhere it's the same user lib are you serious like bro this is your job to know that"
1168960,1176720," not mine why do you force that on the user this is not my job to do all of this like seriously why"
1176720,1183520," the fuck do i need a compiler if this is the stuff i have to do this is like seriously"
1183520,1192480," anyway i'm sorry i'm just like i'm so outraged right now like why the"
1192480,1201920," fuck do i have to even do that are you compiler or what are you just what the fuck uh no files yeah okay"
1206720,1218880," i mean if you claim to support linux you should know that on 99.99 of the linuxes this is where you"
1218880,1225040," find the fucking libraries this is just like a standard at this point just how to code that"
1225040,1232000," don't remove these flags or anything like that just let it customize and stuff but put it as a default value"
1232000,1239440," or something at least have a little bit of respect to the user like what the this is just like outrage"
1239440,1245360," i'm sorry"
1245360,1258400," it's not even that difficult to fix if this is everything it takes to create a dll"
1259040,1267760," on linux if def underscore underscore linux underscore underscore set default linux srt user lib"
1267760,1271680," right don't remove the flag just have a default"
1271680,1278160," anyways sorry"
1280160,1290320," um so it created a bunch of things in here so um all right so if i create something something like"
1290320,1297120," this okay okay so and it also creates h which is rather interesting right so i suppose it creates this"
1297120,1306400," header for you to uh to call this sort of like a um you know library from c this is actually rather"
1306400,1311760," interesting so um let's actually do the following thing uh let's do the phone thing how can we call"
1311760,1315920," our library so let's call it something like test right so this is going to be test library and it's"
1315920,1323600," going to have some some things for example let's call it add int x and int y and we're going to just return"
1323600,1330960," x plus y and then we're going to have something like sub uh right so it's going to be sub and this is going"
1330960,1334560," going to just basically subtract them nothing particularly special so in the first as far as i"
1334560,1341920," know you do extern uh and you just say maybe it's enough to just say that those things are external"
1341920,1348560," right so let's do external uh excuse me and this is going to be test and this is going to be libtest"
1349120,1357440," uh all right so what i have in here um external function ah i see so can i just have something"
1357440,1369280," like this and not provide any any stuff in here uh all right so something like this right so that means"
1369280,1376320," i have to provide the the name of the of the function so i was hoping that maybe it will just pick up this"
1376320,1382000," name and use that as the symbol but no you you literally have to provide it not that big of a deal"
1382000,1387840," not that big of a deal so this one is going to be add and there we go so uh and it created i really"
1387840,1396480," like this thing i really like that it generates the header uh but i think it's kind of flawed"
1396480,1404320," why didn't it generate the the external functions can anybody explain to me like why it didn't generate"
1404320,1411600," is it supposed to generate uh external functions um or or it doesn't just like give you these sort of"
1411600,1420000," like types in case you like i'm not even sure i'm not even sure it's kind of bizarre to me so if i take"
1420000,1427600," a look at an em in here so do i have things like add um it's kind of difficult to find right so because the word"
1427600,1441280," add so let's call it test add test sub right test add test sub uh huh all right so and then if i go here"
1441280,1449920," uh write test uh right test it's not even available there uh external export probably this is probably"
1449920,1459040," what i had to do um experts is that how you do that not external okay so that seems to be working"
1460640,1466400," oh finally and and now generate okay i really like this idea honestly i really like this idea of"
1466400,1473600," generating like headers for c uh right to just like basically describe the the interface of dll i think"
1473600,1479040," it's kind of cool i think it's kind of cool uh right so now that means we should be able to just like"
1479040,1485520," use this library in here uh right so it's actually a really big library like i suppose it includes the"
1485520,1490720," entirety of the c3 runtime and stuff like that and if i take a look at this stuff also here they are"
1490720,1496720," here are all these things in here so that makes sense so that's pretty cool that is a pretty a pretty"
1496720,1501200," cool so let's actually try to create a c thingy right and in here"
1501200,1512000," we are going to include this thing uh we're going to include this thing and in here we're going to just"
1512000,1521840," like do print fd test add 34 35 right i'm going to try to build this entire thing main dot c and we're"
1521840,1530240," going to link with test so it's not so you have to search for this thing in here uh okay so and we"
1530240,1538240," created main and we just ah it couldn't find that right so because we have to search for ld library path"
1538800,1545760," ld library path like so and it worked right so you can see it's 69 and we successfully called c3 code"
1545760,1555280," from c all of that is so freaking cool but that usability bug where you forced to do that linux crt flag"
1555280,1564320," this is it really hurts the promotion of c3 right imagine how cool of a demo this was if this entire thing"
1564320,1572640," was just as intuitive as just dynamically compile that and you get so and a header file you include"
1572640,1579040," header file in c link with the library and it just works without any linux like just think how cool that"
1579040,1579440," would be"
1583440,1589200," zeke and audion would be in shambles like like holy fucking shit i just compiled it without any"
1589200,1591600," bullshit without any flags and it just"
1591600,1599360," and it's so simple to achieve that it is such an easy fix like a low effort fix"
1599360,1602480," but the impact the impact is just like holy"
1602480,1607680," holy fucking shit it's just like you show that in demo and all of the vcs are throwing money at you"
1607680,1609600," like holy fuck holy fuck"
1609600,1617920," usability usability"
1622640,1628320," okay i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm a little bit emotional uh when i see this kind of stuff it's just like"
1628320,1635040," angry with me uh anyways so we can just create like dll and stuff time to get rich mr zozin yeah"
1635040,1642960," exactly exactly exactly eggs poking actually all right so uh i'm really glad that it's super easy to"
1644960,1651600," to create dll and stuff so i suppose the time has come to actually create a simple animation in panim"
1651600,1657280," because on top of panim uh right so it's a little bit more complicated because you also have to link"
1657280,1666400," you also have to link with uh ray leap right so the whole architecture of panim looks roughly like this"
1666400,1674000," right so this is going to be panim and that panim thingy is going to be a square right so and by square"
1674000,1686320," i usually mean executable right and uh you have raylib raylib which is a so file and it's going to be"
1686320,1693440," ellipse and that means it's a dll right and uh panim just uses this dll it calls it like that"
1693440,1702480," then you have your animation right so lib not lim but lib anim which is also so"
1704000,1710320," the dll and it's loaded dynamically into into the engine so engine uses both"
1710320,1718640," uh your animation and raylib as so dynamically this is very important but on top of that on top of that"
1718640,1727040," your animation as well uses the same raylib that's how it works so essentially panim organizes a loop"
1727840,1733920," event loop that constantly does begin drawing and drawing and between begin drawing and end drawing"
1733920,1742560," it calls your function update update from update frame which uses the same raylib the same raylib to draw"
1742560,1751120," that frame so essentially the engine and your animation using the shared state of raylib to do all of the"
1751120,1758560," drawing so that's how it works so what we have to do in c3 we have to create the nso file and we have to"
1758560,1764720," also link with the dynamic raylib so to organize this sort of like architecture does that make sense i hope"
1764720,1770320," that makes sense and what this allows you to do it allows you to hot reload your animation right so for"
1770320,1778400," example um you updated it and recompile it you ask panim engine please reload this entire thing it unloads"
1778400,1785360," your thing then loads a new one right in and continues without stopping so that's how entire thing works"
1785360,1789520," you know the classical hot reloading thing nothing particularly special so now what we need to do we"
1789520,1794640," need to write this thing in c3 somehow right so let's go ahead and do that"
1797600,1807440," so now we know at least how to do that so studying panim uh all right so panim is using knob for"
1807440,1815360," building right and here we have a bunch of things okay so this is how we build the um the plugins right"
1815360,1819760," so we have c plugins and we have a separate thing that builds c plus plus plugins and i suppose what we"
1819760,1827360," need to do in here we need to do something like a build plug c3 right so force what the is"
1827360,1836480," force force is that a flag ah i think that's kind of funny so knob has minus like this specific"
1836480,1842480," instance of knob has minus f flag which forces rebuild because these things they check whether"
1842480,1847760," it needs rebuild or not but sometimes you want to force rebuild all over all of them and we'll actually"
1847760,1853120," do that through this sort of flag that is passed around that's kind of funny so because if i try to just"
1853120,1860400," do knob uh like so right so then i can do minus f and it rebuilds all of them right so yeah they"
1860400,1864800," take a little bit of a time to rebuild that's probably why i don't rebuild them every time"
1864800,1870080," right so that that makes sense anyway so let's actually maybe create a similar thing"
1870080,1879200," so src dir we're in the source we're going to have how should i call that um i don't know so let's call it"
1879200,1884560," probe 2 and it's going to be c3 right so because for c plus plus we call it just probe this one is"
1884560,1895360," probe 2 c3 right so and then build dir uh we're going to have a lib probe 2 so and uh then if it"
1895360,1900560," didn't succeed with it we just return uh you know three in here so i suppose what we're going to do in"
1900560,1912320," here we're going to just like copy paste existing function uh right so build plug plug c3 and here is"
1912320,1918720," the signature the the force flag that rebuilds everything the command uh command is just like a"
1918720,1924080," dynamic array of the arguments of the command line and stuff like that the path to the source code and"
1924080,1929520," the output the path to the output so that's what it is so here's how we're checking that something"
1929520,1936480," needs to rebuild so we have a function and knob uh that given output and input it answers to you"
1936480,1940880," whether it needs to be rebuilt or not right so the way it does that it just compares the modification"
1940880,1946800," dates nothing particularly special right and it returns you three three values it can be zero it"
1946800,1951440," could be one it can be minus one in case of minus one an error has happened in that case you just"
1951440,1956320," have to return with false because the error will be logged automatically by this function anyway you"
1956320,1960880," don't have to say anything you just have to say you have to just return out of that nothing particularly"
1960880,1968320," special so and then if somebody defined force you rebuild anyway regardless of this what this thing"
1968320,1973920," does right so that's how we do that you see very simple and straightforward stuff very simple and"
1973920,1980800," straightforward stuff oh here we are cleaning up some stuff right so we can assume that cmd maybe"
1981440,1987760," not empty not empty yeah that's kind of funny right so we don't really have to do that anymore because"
1987760,1996960," recently in knob cmd we introduced a very cool function uh which is basically like this cmd run i think and"
1996960,2004960," it's called and reset uh right and reset and it actually accepts cmd by a pointer and resets uh its value"
2004960,2010880," cleans up so you can reuse it uh yet again uh you know successfully so i think this code is rather old"
2010880,2017440," it was written before i introduced this run and reset pattern into knob and by the way one of the"
2017440,2022800," reasons why i introduced this run and reset pattern is because i was kept doing this kind of where i had"
2022800,2029600," to make sure okay the count of the cmd is zero all the time well i mean you always want to reuse it after"
2029600,2035680," you run it so that's why we have run and reset uh so i think it's it's much a better pattern in my opinion"
2035680,2040960," so in here i'm going to just like reset it just in case because the rest of the code kind of assumes that"
2040960,2048480," it can be not empty right so just like let's reset it just in case and in here let's start creating the uh"
2048480,2055440," command line you know command line arguments right so here we're going to have c3c so then we're going"
2055440,2066480," to do dynamic lib and we have to do this linux crt right and it's just user lib like this like user lib"
2066480,2075520," for the output for the output we're going to use the output path and for the input we're going to use a"
2075520,2079760," source path right so that's basically what we have in here so it doesn't really have to be like this"
2079760,2087280," and after that i think that's it right so on top of this i think we have to link with the array lib"
2087280,2094480," right we kind of have to link with the array we already have some code that adds flags for linking"
2094480,2100480," with the rally but it's only for c because of that i think i need to actually call it something like c"
2101600,2107200," right so because these flags are not suitable for specifically c3 right i think it does make"
2107200,2113280," sense so but anyway let's actually try to compile this entire thing and see how miserably is going"
2113280,2119040," to fail and just go through the compilation errors right so yeah it doesn't have libs so it has to be"
2119040,2127760," libc anything else another libc situation another libc situation there we go so and"
2127760,2140080," something went wrong and i don't know exactly what this is probably because i forgot to return"
2142240,2147440," that nob that i successfully did this thing so and furthermore i didn't even run the command right so i"
2147440,2156960," should have done smd run sync and reset all right so this is going to be cmd if not that uh return false"
2156960,2163360," right so that's how we're going to be doing all that if i try to rebuild that oh i'm using old knob"
2164000,2169520," this is such an old project like i should have expected that right so the new features of knob they"
2169520,2178880," are not even there yet so this is one of the cool things about um about knob right is that it kind of"
2178880,2185920," never decays well i mean you just saw it decay a little bit but it doesn't decay in a different sense"
2186640,2193120," in the sense that if you're using uh something like cmake and or auto tools to build your project"
2193120,2201120," over time if you don't update the configuration of your project and stuff like that the newer cmake and"
2201120,2209760," newer auto tools will not be able to build your project here if you're using knob you actually use"
2209760,2216480," the older version of knob you actually can commit the older version of knob into the source code"
2217280,2223600," so that means it doesn't matter for how long your source code ferments you're always using the"
2223600,2231360," relevant version of your build tool because build tool tool is part of your source code this is actually"
2231360,2239840," something that a lot of um build tool developers really really neglect it doesn't yeah it doesn't"
2239840,2248480," bitwrote in that sense it bitwrote in different sense but it doesn't bitwrote in that sense uh right so it"
2248480,2255120," it just simply uses all the version of knob right it just use all the inversion of knob that only depends on"
2255120,2264320," postex api so it bitwrote as fast as postex api and postex api by the way bitwrote very very slowly"
2264320,2272320," because it's standardized and a lot of very powerful entities all around the world depend on postex being"
2272320,2280240," stable and by very powerful entities i mean corporations governments and those entities are"
2280240,2287840," not a fucking joke they are putting a lot of their influence a lot of their money into maintaining this"
2287840,2299840," api being stable if you depend on for example web apis only the web corporations like google use their"
2299840,2306880," influence and money to keep them uh to keep them stable but the influence and money of google are pretty"
2306880,2314480," shaky because more powerful entities like government can always fuck up google at any time which they are"
2314480,2325600," currently doing antitrust situation right so um but nobody stays above the governments right so if the"
2325600,2331120," government maintains a certain api stable you can be pretty damn fucking sure that it's gonna stable"
2332000,2339120," if google maintains some api stable well maybe it will survive for like 10 years for 20 years max"
2339120,2346880," but then google is gonna be ripped apart chrome is gonna be ripped apart from google everything is gonna"
2346880,2352240," fall apart and everything it's like nobody knows what's gonna happen postex is pretty good we got"
2352240,2361040," fucking damn stable um you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about so yeah"
2361040,2361920," fuck google by the way"
2361920,2372320," only god stays above the government imagine an api maintained by god"
2377440,2382960," i think i think i know the answer we should write for temple os we should write for temple os we should write"
2382960,2386560," for temple os its api maintained by god himself"
2386560,2399120," even the governments can do anything to temple os like it's just like it's the god himself maintains this api"
2400720,2407840," i'm telling you anyways so let's go ahead and update number uh so um if you want to actually use not for"
2407840,2415040," yourself which i don't i don't know if i recommend but i mean it's kind of a very special thing right so"
2415040,2420080," for for a special mindset i would say so but i'm going to put that in the description just in case"
2420080,2425760," if you want to play with it right so here is another thing right it's kind of like yeah um"
2427040,2432480," so you need to be like a simplicity junkie like like i am if you want to use knob but it's pretty"
2432480,2438400," usable it's pretty usable nonetheless uh so not dot h so let's actually download this mother flipper"
2438400,2447840," uh let's do a row let's row dog knob and i'm gonna just like literally w get it uh i think i have to do"
2447840,2456160," that in src i'm pretty sure about that boom so let's see how many changes were up okay so w get does"
2456160,2462480," not replace things look at the difference so this is old knob this is the new knob"
2462480,2472640," the bloat the blow is creeping the bloat is literally creeping so if i do that and we can"
2472640,2480240," even take a look at how many changes were made uh since then uh yep that's a lot of changes but it"
2480240,2485120," should be kind of backward compatible i don't think i'd introduce anything like super backward incompatible so"
2485120,2491040," i'm pretty sure it is going to just work if i try to do something like that and it kind of did in"
2491040,2497840," fact work right so it kind of did in fact work uh but the compilation has failed uh of c3 right"
2497840,2505600," because we didn't have the file knob2 c3 uh prop2 not knob2 right so we can do something like touch"
2505600,2513920," uh we can touch this file we can rebuild yeah there we go so it still works you see so the size of the knob"
2513920,2519440," the knob increased twice but it's still backward compatible i just copy it to the older project"
2519440,2525360," and it just works so but now it also has additional features we're trying to kind of maintain it backward"
2525360,2533760," compatible to some extent as much as we can uh right so as much as we can so uh as so as so did it create a"
2533760,2547600," what kind of windows brain worm is that excuse me"
2558640,2565360," needless to say that c3 is kind of rough around the abuse the general direction is kind of correct"
2565360,2573840," but sometimes some of the like very specific small little thing is it's just like why is it like that"
2573840,2579200," but again as already said probably not very many people are using this language right so that's why"
2579200,2589200," not not not that many people bump into those things uh so yeah okay so that means we should not put a saw in"
2589200,2597120," there which by the way i just realized that it could be could be actually based just a second it could be"
2597120,2607200," actually based right because that means on different platforms it's going to pick a different extension"
2607200,2615040," so you don't have to if definitely okay this is actually based jai does that okay okay this is actually"
2615040,2621120," based it's just like me being dummy okay okay so i i take everything i said back so uh this is based"
2621120,2628720," actually this is based all right i agree with that okay okay sure fair fair enough fair enough uh so let's"
2628720,2641600," actually build everything let's actually build everything uh okay all right so yeah it looks like it is"
2641600,2647840," working it looks like and there we go so it also built header in here um it would be interesting"
2648960,2654320," now so i was thinking maybe i should i want to put the header somewhere else but i think it's fine"
2654320,2661360," the header being here but i don't really plan for that hair to to be used anywhere because the c already"
2661360,2667680," knows how to interact with these plugins because we already have a header for them so here's the header"
2667680,2675920," this one and that means we need to implement all of these functions in c3 to be able to load these things"
2675920,2683280," so we can even go ahead and try to already load the plugin we created in c3 into panem and see how"
2683280,2693280," miserably it's going to fail so let's do build panem and build uh libprobe as so there we go and define"
2693280,2698000," simple main why the were you trying to load main"
2698000,2706240," what"
2706240,2711360," all right so main"
2714960,2721680," whatever who said that who said main is that panem who said main why were you trying to load me"
2721680,2735920," um okay that's bizarre so let me take a look at what we have in here wait it could be actually bug in panem"
2736720,2744720," um load symbol so reload lib plug uh-huh"
2744720,2751120," right and it i it doesn't have anything hard coded here is the thing it doesn't have anything"
2751120,2756480," how about it what it does it just like opens it up and it iterates through all of the known plugins and"
2756480,2766000," just like dl sims them and then just like asks dl error so new backdoor just dropped maybe it is a"
2766000,2772720," backdrop of some sort who knows uh plug.h and yeah so that's the only thing that we are trying to to"
2772720,2778480," load over anything so and also we accept the environment by a value get damn it"
2779520,2785680," so i don't think it's a very good idea right especially for interrupt especially for interrupt"
2785680,2789840," okay so before i define all of these things what if i go ahead and"
2789840,2802080," just literally create main right so main and i'm going to export this main like so right so and then"
2802080,2806800," just not going to do anything because i wonder if you want to load the main function let's just"
2806800,2811920," let you load the main function and see what happens right if that's what you want right so"
2811920,2822160," okay that's very interesting so now it wants a plug init and before it's the c runtime looking for main"
2822160,2829040," that's a funny hypothesis that could be a case"
2832240,2843360," that means that this error will happen if i just do dl open of that is so i need to i need to test that"
2843360,2850880," like this is a mystery like this is enigma i want to investigate that like what the is going on in here"
2850880,2857520," i think it works by creating dll is so file oh you guys talking among each other i'm sorry yeah yeah so"
2857520,2865200," that's something directed to me um uh so because it links with c ah it also links with crt and shits"
2865200,2875040," it's freaking fascinating anyway so let's just literally try to load dl open that file uh in c"
2875040,2882800," and see what happened right so how do you do uh man dl open right so mendl open and let's just put it in"
2882800,2888880," here so we also have to put some flags in there and i think it's something or yeah so it's whether"
2888880,2897120," you want to load them now or later and this could be the key to our struggles so there's two flags in"
2897120,2904800," here which is lazy uh resolve symbols only as the code that reference them is executed and now resolve the"
2904800,2912480," symbols as like all of them as soon as possible maybe yeah so maybe you need to put lazy so it"
2912480,2920080," doesn't try to eagerly resolve main or something like that i think we're learning something i think"
2920080,2924480," think we're on the right track to learn something new in here i really like that i really like when"
2924480,2929760," you discover some like that and you just actually learn something cool uh all right so this is going to be"
2929760,2938160," just build and then lib probe to electric boogaloo all right so in here we have lib and if lib is equal to"
2938160,2945680," null all right we're going to do something like uh std error std error error uh let's actually do something"
2945680,2957600," like a file path const chart file path like so we don't even need that right so could not load s s and so"
2957600,2965760," here is file path dl error like this and we just return one otherwise we just do print f uh okay"
2965760,2973920," maybe even print the whole thing maybe even call it in for for the consistency um yeah and in here we can"
2973920,2984240," put a new line file path new line let's fucking go so cco test test c and let's do test so it didn't work"
2984240,2994240," because you also have to include this thingy in here let's fucking go boom it loaded successfully"
2994240,3005920," this is because main was present there so now if i go to here and remove the main and recompile the whole"
3005920,3012080," thing uh not really like that but just you know knob recompile and then"
3012080,3016480," look at that"
3016480,3026800," fascinating"
3026800,3037520," dll open expect you to have main and if you compile dll with c without main it will still add that fucking main"
3040720,3051760," does it call this freaking main so probe two uh i'm gonna do a fan void main expert"
3051760,3053680," main"
3053680,3057280," import stdio"
3057280,3061440," print fn"
3061440,3072080," uh hello from c3 like so so let's do and this is not really what i wanted i went to just a knob"
3072080,3076400," uh-huh so i forgot the semicolon the proper center"
3078000,3080960," uh could not be found did you spell print"
3080960,3084240," uh-huh"
3084240,3095360," didn't print anything though it didn't actually call it it just loaded it it simply loaded it"
3095360,3102240," so now um yeah i was hoping that maybe it will like literally call it but it didn't"
3103040,3106880," so because maybe it's like expect initialization or something like that"
3106880,3110720," right so because in elf there is sort of like a init function that like and"
3110720,3118080," in me and fini i thought it's somehow related to that um so because it probably has underscore start"
3118080,3123520," and the neat code but nothing calls the code yeah so here's the another interesting thing that we can"
3123520,3129760," try so i'm going to not export this entire thing right i'm going to just like do it like that which"
3129760,3134080," will probably mean that it's going to get optimized out but it didn't get optimized out so okay"
3134080,3141120," all right so it doesn't exist anymore and now in test i'm actually using lazy"
3141120,3150160," even if you use lazy it's still gonna try to load this because it actively tries to do that so"
3150160,3158800," the dl open really wants main it really wants main so and another interesting thing okay so let's"
3158800,3163280," take a look at things that are written in c so this thing is written in c if i take a look at the"
3163280,3169360," external symbols does it have main it doesn't even have main it doesn't even have main"
3169360,3180480," i think crt0 wants main the the one that you actually link with c3 c3 has a special need and"
3180480,3192320," stuff it's pretty cool so that means you're telling me that c3 potentially generates some code that also"
3192320,3198960," wants to dynamically load main or something is that what's going on"
3202720,3211920," and it doesn't even call it it's probably an accident maybe we discovered uh the start in 31 once"
3211920,3216480," main in c3 links with underscore star uh-huh"
3216480,3225360," can you compile this stuff without well i mean maybe it should have actually linked with a different thing"
3229200,3236000," and let's go start in so it wants main and c3 links so what's the solution in here so whose bug is this"
3236000,3243520," chat whose bug is this is that our bug or is that c3 bug i have a feeling that it's a c3 bug so they"
3243520,3251600," may be linked with the wrong crt thingy they might have actually linked with the wrong crt so when you're"
3251600,3259840," creating dll's with like with which crt do you have to link do you have to link with crt at all um should"
3259840,3274720," not link with crt okay so the question is c3 uh dynamic lib help so crt win 30 uh say the territory to use for"
3274720,3283440," finding 30 to begin and related can i just say no crt so there's an um lip c thingy but i don't want to"
3283440,3294080," do lip c thingy um maybe we're holding it wrong kind of bug due to that atrocious command line no entry bro"
3295920,3307760," no entry no"
3307760,3321920," okay one more time all right so we have this kind of situation now i'm going to to here"
3325920,3333280," no no it didn't help"
3333280,3336240," it didn't help"
3336240,3343440," so no entry didn't help um so"
3343440,3349920," yeah it needs the c runtime"
3354400,3358080," so don't link crt when using no entry maybe"
3358080,3361200," all right"
3361200,3374880," so let me go to third party here uh can i just grab the crt one uh well i can already see some interesting"
3374880,3383360," stuff uh so oh uh so what do we have in here so this is just a build how can i like exclude deer build"
3384000,3390160," yeah there we go uh yeah there we go uh so this is that set the director to use"
3390160,3399120," crt related stuff okay so find lib like a free bsd that's understandable linux crt"
3399120,3406480," okay so there's also this thing uh this one is kind of weird linker setup linux"
3407760,3415680," so crt one uh so crt one uh scrt position independent and stuff like that"
3415680,3421920," yeah there should be something done with the linker but i don't really want to mess with that right now"
3421920,3429040," i really don't want to mess with that right now no std leap also we have we have a lot of stuff right here"
3430080,3438240," uh uh user lead by the way user lib"
3438240,3448080," anyways um i guess one could pass the path to an empty crt one zero but like who does that"
3448080,3455120," well yes i was thinking maybe i can hack the compiler to um to do something about that"
3455920,3457920," but it's not really that important"
3457920,3475280," all right we're back uh internet went down again get used to that it's going to happen every single"
3475280,3477920," stream at this point so whatever so"
3479120,3485680," we already have a way to reproduce that i think i think we already have a way to reproduce that what"
3485680,3492800," we can do so to not forget we can just report an issue right now i think that's going to be a good"
3492800,3497600," idea chat i think that's going to be a good idea let's actually report it as an issue uh so"
3498480,3509760," yeah so probe uh c3 c3 dll bug uh it's actually really easy to to reproduce right so this is going"
3509760,3517280," to be lib uh c3 and um it's going to be literally empty i think uh it's going to be literally empty and"
3517280,3523600," then here uh we have a load c right so here is just a load c and i think i'm going to"
3525040,3530000," uh do something like this i'm going to just literally copy paste the whole thing in here"
3530000,3542640," uh-huh and so here we're going to just do lib so just lib so uh-huh uh-huh file path dl error and"
3542640,3549280," it's kind of important to i think to do that on linux all right so the way we reproduce that is run sh"
3550240,3573280," bnsh um so c3c compile run um compile run dynamic i'm sorry dynamic lib uh linux crt user lib um o lib libc3"
3573280,3579440," right so let's actually enable maybe tracing for now uh-huh so let's make this thing executable"
3580240,3587280," and uh yeah it created the thing it created the thing uh and on top of that what we have to do"
3587280,3595920," uh we have to also compile this kind of stuff so load load dot c uh-huh so if i try to do that it"
3595920,3605920," seems to be working so if i do load uh could not open because we have to do that from here"
3607120,3616800," and let's do run sh like this yeah so that's pretty cool so that's the reproduction um"
3620640,3636000," uh so uh let's go to c3 length c3c uh and let's try to uh do this kind of stuff okay so what exactly does"
3636000,3647680," it say what exactly does it say um and define symbol main and define symbol main uh when trying to"
3649040,3663760," dll open and so file compiled from c3 uh on linux right so that's what we're trying to do to do so let's"
3663760,3677040," start with this kind of thing uh excuse me lipsy oh it's empty okay how can i do this kind of thing so we can do"
3677040,3689360," something like this so c3 uh maybe i'm gonna just do c3 so leap c3 and file lipsy three"
3689360,3699440," i don't really know maybe it makes sense to uh maybe pack it up right maybe pack it up uh so let's remove"
3699440,3705520," this kind of stuff and maybe move this kind of stuff and maybe this kind of stuff right but i mean it's"
3705520,3712320," actually super small right let's let's actually try to do that for a file uh literally"
3714320,3721200," an empty file and empty file right we have three files"
3721200,3728560," uh libc then uh c file load c"
3728560,3734880," uh right something like this"
3736720,3751040," uh run sh uh run sh let's also put load um um"
3751040,3761040," um"
3761040,3781680," uh when we run uh run the search when we do dash run the search we get the following error"
3783600,3787920," console uh and let me try to do something like that"
3787920,3792000," uh-huh"
3792000,3809280," which is not something you would expect in this kind of uh situation"
3810240,3817120," because uh we are uh talking about dynamic libraries"
3817120,3824000," what main has anything to do with that"
3824000,3836720," we suspect it has something to do with c3 linking the um the dynamic library library with"
3837520,3850240," crt10 which um wants to have a main function or something like that"
3850240,3865360," in any case this really feels like a bug okay so so do something like my environment my environment"
3867360,3869760," uh-huh something like this console"
3869760,3874160," uh so c3c version"
3874160,3879440," so this is basically what we have"
3879440,3885440," so and maybe yeah"
3885440,3889920," neo fetch i also want to give new fetch"
3897200,3906000," uh oh god um so i didn't properly"
3906000,3927040," uh oh god did it work uh oh god um so i didn't properly"
3927040,3929600," did the thing but i don't know"
3929600,3938720," yeah so it doesn't have enough spaces because those spaces are"
3938720,3944320," uh yeah i see i see those spaces are not proper spaces that's a bit annoying"
3944320,3950640," uh let me quickly try to fix that we can try to fix that by doing something like"
3951680,3960000," this where we grab that space where we grab that space and i suppose specifically in here"
3960000,3962880," we quickly replace the regular space with that space"
3962880,3968400," all right and because of that this thing i believe"
3968400,3973920," um is gonna i apologize this is so stupid"
3974880,3978800," i'm too lazy to kind of fix it properly"
3978800,3985600," so yeah uh we're gonna we're gonna do it like that"
3985600,3988880," uh does it look good does it look it doesn't look even good"
3988880,3991760," something about yeah"
3994480,4001120," i don't know let's not do that um we already kind of mentioned that we're on linux so it's"
4001120,4006720," specifically linux thing um all right so let's not be close this time"
4009200,4016080," right i think it's good enough uh so let's submit an issue"
4016080,4023840," you removed spaces just now whatever um okay it doesn't matter"
4023840,4031280," so we reported this kind of bug and let's go ahead and continue doing things as you can see the"
4031280,4036960," and the language is not finished the language is not finished right because again uh not not that many"
4036960,4042000," people using it in all of these like different use cases and stuff like that you really need to"
4042000,4046240," like actively use it to catch all of that and also you need to report this kind of thing so"
4046240,4051680," the developers know that something is weird going on right so something is weird going on"
4052560,4064080," uh yep so anyways so let's go ahead and do the panine thingy do the panine thingy um so we're gonna just"
4064080,4076800," basically always create this main function right so um edit uh because of and i can now refer to this"
4076800,4081280," thing okay so reporting box is actually kind of useful thing because now"
4081840,4087120," um like i can put it in here and explain why this function even exists in here"
4087120,4090080," rena says generate o and do linking with gcc"
4090080,4095360," did you answer in here uh or"
4095360,4102480," uh but he says to do that as a proper final solution or as a workaround"
4102480,4107760," what is that is that a proper solution or is that a workaround if that's a workaround"
4107760,4111120," i can just create main function so this is also a valid workaround"
4111120,4117600," uh right so it's not a critical bug it's just like it feels like a bug uh but it's not critical one you"
4117600,4120400," can do a workaround you can link it so it's also a valid workaround uh right so it's it's not a critical bug it's just like it feels like a bug uh but it's not critical one you can do a workaround you can link it so"
4120400,4129680," so you can just create it so you can just create it so you can just create the main function so that's"
4129680,4129680," so that's also valid workaround uh right so it's it's not a critical bug it's just like it feels like a bug uh but it's not critical one you can do a workaround you can link it so like you suggested or you can just create this function i didn't think it's that big of a deal um so but maybe i'm gonna keep this work around uh like in mind"
4129680,4141680," just in case this one doesn't work for whatever reason right just because this one doesn't work for whatever reason right just because it compiles right now doesn't mean it's gonna stop working at some point right so"
4141680,4155680," it doesn't mean it doesn't mean that it's gonna stop working at some point right so it means it doesn't mean that it's gonna stop working at some point it may stop working at some point so anyways um i guess we can finally continue i guess we can finally continue"
4155680,4169680," you see discovering box release it's gonna stop working at some point yeah so it doesn't mean that it's gonna stop working at some point it may stop working at some point so anyways um i guess we can finally continue i guess we can finally continue"
4169680,4179600," you see discovering box reporting box and stuff like that um okay so let me let me see so now what i have to do i have to create"
4179600,4191120," the the rest of the things right so let's do knob uh let's do knob and let's do build panim build lib prob uh to so"
4191120,4199440," right so it wants plug in it let's go ahead and just create this thing uh plug in it as far as i know it has to have"
4199680,4207280," a very specific signature as well plug plug in it there we go so it has to have a very specific"
4207280,4213840," signature what what's that signature is going to be um actually it's nothing it doesn't have any specific"
4213840,4221760," signature i forgot about it anyways uh right so let's go ahead and just rebuild the whole thing like so"
4222400,4230160," uh so pre-reload we might as well actually copy paste all of these functions in here right and just create"
4230160,4238400," them uh right i think it's going to be fine so boom boom boom i want you in my room so also delete training"
4238400,4250000," white spaces okay so uh what the f just happened all right so let's go and this is going to be"
4250000,4259920," so all these things are return values if i'm not mistaken right which is a bit annoying which is a bit"
4259920,4267360," annoying because i can't easily move this thing to here right so because emacs doesn't allow me to select"
4267360,4278640," it properly but anyway this one um does return just void like so and in here we can just do something"
4278640,4285520," like that and in here we can just do something like that so in case of this stuff we don't have to do any"
4285520,4292800," of that stuff an environment it's a structure if i'm not mistaken right so we're passing this kind of"
4292800,4301520," thing by structure let's not pass anything in here so anyway uh let's quickly define all these functions"
4301520,4312400," so this is going to be fn uh-huh like this and i'm going to just click paste that stuff x export like so"
4314000,4324480," yes please boom boom so we've got the folk teams we've got the folk teams if i try to build them"
4324480,4332240," so something is not working missing return okay so we can right away return true so the engine will"
4332240,4339680," let's actually not let's actually put false right so because it will constantly think that it's rendering"
4339680,4347520," things uh right so this is basically the functions the engines expect the dll to export right so that's"
4347520,4356640," basically what it expects to to to see uh right so and if i try to do it now okay so missing return in"
4356640,4362640," reload uh reload was supposed to return something let's just return new in this specific case"
4364000,4371120," and it worked so that's pretty cool uh it works it didn't do anything right so because we didn't"
4371120,4377440," implement anything um but it did some things right so it did something which is cool just cool i really"
4377440,4387200," like that okay uh so essentially um plugin it is going to be called once by the engine so you initialize all"
4387200,4393760," the stuff that you want to initialize uh let's go ahead and do that so maybe we can just print something"
4393760,4401760," print fn um so let's put this kind of thing in here and in here we're going to say something like uh"
4402400,4413040," hello from c3 animation plugin like so look at that accidentally aligned accidentally aligned so now if"
4413040,4419120," i try to do something like that right i'm going to close that there we go so this is the time at which"
4419120,4426880," the c3 animation plugin has been loaded so yeah that's pretty cool again if you can create like a dll"
4426880,4432720," that exports this function you can work with this engine right so it's sort of like it's it's rather"
4432720,4440480," language agnostic the only languages it can't work with is a toy scripting language right so because the"
4440480,4449040," scripting languages usually can't create a dll by themselves but actually you can if you want to do"
4449040,4454800," like animations in a toy scripting language you can take an interpreter of the toy scripting language"
4455360,4460960," be that python javascript or law like any of these toy scripting languages you can take its interpreter"
4460960,4466320," compile it yeah exactly the spirit man actually got the idea compile it down to the dll"
4466320,4474080," also provide bindings for raylib and then not only you'll be able to use your toy scripting language in"
4474080,4482480," a serious engine for animations but you can reuse the same dll for different kind of scripts so it becomes a"
4482480,4488640," plugin for several uh you know animations written in different toy scripting languages so you can do"
4488640,4494640," something like that maybe we can do that by the way we can write a single single plugin for lua"
4494640,4503440," that sounds like a cool topic for another stream holy shit that's a cool idea i should try to do that i"
4503440,4510880," should try to do that so and then you can have several layers of hot reloading you can hot reload the dll of the"
4510880,4517440," animation and the dll of the animation that is interpreter of lure can hot reload the lure scripts"
4517440,4523840," so you can have several layers of these things that sounds really cool yeah and what's funny is that"
4523840,4532720," uh it doesn't mean that you don't support native plugins right so you can use both you can do serious"
4532720,4539200," languages languages that statically typed and compiled to real machine code or you can do toy scripting"
4539200,4544640," languages or like which are working with a single plugin which is written in a serious programming"
4544640,4554400," language uh yeah lou actually would work great so yeah that sounds like a cool idea we're gonna do that"
4554400,4560240," we're gonna do that chat but not today not today so people keep asking me zozin how do you get ideas for your"
4560240,4566800," stream they get born right on the stream right uh out of my mind wound"
4566800,4579920," anyway let's continue so uh we uh we need to accept structures actually right because one of the things"
4579920,4588800," we do here uh is when you call plug updates when you call plug update so here is the blog plug the page"
4588800,4597520," plug update accepts environments environment as an argument it's an environment of the engine"
4597520,4606640," and what is environment you may ask it's a structure that looks roughly like this so it's um it has delta time"
4606640,4613120," screen width screen height and whether you are currently rendering the video or not right because"
4613120,4619600," you the the engine operates in two modes the mode of preview right so when you're interacting in the"
4619600,4626240," window and stuff like that and the mode when it renders the final mp4 video right and in that mode it"
4626240,4633600," keeps still running your plugin but it uses your plugin for generating frames to feed into ffm pack so an"
4633600,4641040," animation may know and act differently depending on whether you are in a rendering mode or not in a"
4641040,4648720," rendering mode the reason being is that maybe the animations are written in native languages so that"
4648720,4655360," means they can do whatever they want for example talk to the network technically you can do that it's kind"
4655360,4660400," of dumb but but technically you can do that it's an arbitrary code you can do whatever the you want"
4660400,4668720," but the animations when you render a video during rendering the frames trying to access network or doing"
4668720,4674640," some weird stuff might not be what you want when rendering the final video so to let the animation"
4674640,4680160," distinguish okay we're interacting with the user and in that case we can do something to make the user"
4680160,4684560," comfortable or some some stuff like that maybe additional inputs or whatnot but when we're"
4684560,4689200," rendering that doesn't make sense so when because of that you have additional flag where you can check"
4689200,4694240," okay so we're in a rendering mode not in rendering mode and so on and so forth makes sense i think it"
4694240,4700880," makes sense right so because the plugins can actually provide bigger capability than uh just the engine"
4700880,4704560," they can handle additional inputs because they work with the radio directly"
4705520,4711520," so and sometimes like when you render in the final video you don't need those capabilities in fact they"
4711520,4716800," may prevent you from rendering the final video that you want to use in your in your video in your youtube"
4716800,4724080," video or something like that right so this flag is actually kind of important and play sound is uh an"
4724080,4731280," abstract method right precisely for the same reason as we have a rendering because we can be in two different modes"
4731280,4736320," right if you are in a preview mode when you play a sound it's going to be played through your dynamics"
4736320,4744160," or through headphones or whatever but when you are rendering play sound will be sending that signal to"
4744160,4750400," ffm pack so again a little bit of a dispatching a little bit of a polymorphism uh right so depending"
4750400,4754160," on the mode it's going to just do different things it's going to reroute the sound to different places"
4754160,4759840," so that's basically the environment right the environment tells you where you are rendering environment"
4759840,4765440," not rendering environment and stuff like that and the screen width again all right so the renderer may"
4765440,4772320," just set a very specific resolution and you have to uh do that within that resolution so i suppose one"
4772320,4778000," thing we can do in here for specifically c3 is just put this thing in here uh like that"
4778000,4788720," i just put this thing in here like that and uh so sound wave you know what you know what you know we're"
4788720,4794320," not going to be calling play sound and i don't want to be i don't want to spend time figuring out uh"
4794320,4800480," like how to define sound from raylib and wave from raylib so the thing i can do in here is just"
4800480,4811600," uh you know depth play sound funk which is going to be just a funk that simply returns void and doesn't"
4811600,4819760," accept anything and in here we can say play sound funk play sound there we go and we're not going"
4819760,4824080," to be calling it right now right so we're going to just acknowledge that this is a pointer to the"
4824080,4829200," function we're not going to be calling it right so because you need to sort of like a provide a correct"
4829200,4841600," signature right so to do uh signature to play off play sound funk is incorrect is incorrect uh big to save"
4841600,4850240," time uh right so that's basically what we have here and uh so now plug update uh we're gonna accept the"
4850240,4856640," environment in here so in an environment we have delta time screen width screen height and so on and so forth"
4857680,4866880," so uh yes yes yes and funny enough funny enough now if i do update i might even print something on"
4866880,4874160," each individual frame right so c3 animation frame and let's print delta time in here so this is going"
4874160,4883600," to be fn uh environment delta time delta time so let's go uh let's try to run this entire thing doesn't"
4883600,4893120," compile because the semicolon uh because semicolon boom okay so and it was as you can see it was"
4893120,4901360," successfully run and telling you correct delta time expect in except the first one so with the first one"
4901360,4906800," something was wrong but we get delta time from ray leap so it's a ray leap who actually reported in correct"
4906800,4912880," that time i think uh all right so it's just like when you're rendering the first uh frame you don't"
4912880,4918640," know what is the correct that okay so the the last thing we need to do is just link with the ray leap"
4918640,4925120," and we're a gucci we're fucking tamaguchi we can do um so all right so let me acknowledge the subs people"
4925120,4932960," been subscribing and i didn't notice that so um dm1 thank you so much for doing with the message c3 says no to dll you can too"
4932960,4938720," yeah so i code bad thank you so much for gifting the subs void manager thank you so much for everyone"
4938720,4943280," with the message two years already thank you for letting me participate in all these speed runs with"
4943280,4948400," all the joy and the frustration that comes with it you're awesome even when uh becoming really"
4948400,4953760," irritated with the chat so yeah thank you thank you so much for the warm words uh health you on thank you"
4953760,4958800," so much for tier one uh thank you thank you thank you all right so let's actually try to link this"
4958800,4968160," mother flipper with uh ray leap um so there is this thing in c3 i think it's a vendor um i think it's"
4968160,4977360," a vendor and in the vendor maybe i can steal some uh ray leap oh there's a two separate things now for"
4977360,4983040," ready uh and which one do we use i think we are still using ray leap 5 or i'm pretty sure we're still"
4983040,4988640," using ready five and i'm thinking maybe i can just like use this thing uh module ray leap five"
4988640,5000480," oh my god was it was it done recently or something wait wait is it recent so when was it done i didn't see"
5002720,5007840," four months ago four months ago okay so okay so it's it's understandable"
5007840,5016720," so ray leap five um i suppose i'm gonna just steal this thing right so this is something that i was"
5016720,5023840," talking about right like having like a ray leap uh prefix would be nice um so i wonder if i can just like"
5023840,5032800," do it do it like that and just put it put it in here wget uh and yeah let's just download this stuff"
5032800,5040080," i did i download html no i didn't do some sometimes forget to press row and it downloads the entire html"
5040080,5049840," which is annoying but anyway so in uh probe two we want to import ray leap ray leap five"
5050720,5058720," rl ray leap five rl and uh let's just try to do that and it can't compile that because we need to specify"
5058720,5064240," that thing um so how are we going to be specified so this is the source we might"
5064240,5074080," basically just do something like that build uh src what was the source folder i forgot ah it's a src"
5074080,5086720," dear src dear uh slash ray leap c3i okay now will you please work okay that's very cool"
5086720,5096000," what's funny i didn't even have to link anything because ray leap is already automatically loaded"
5097440,5106080," by the engine so yeah it's already automatically loaded by the engine so that means i can just do that"
5106080,5117440," really rl draw right okay so let me actually open uh draw rectangle okay"
5119840,5128320," so that means i can i don't know position zero position that 100 100 do you have something like red"
5128320,5132240," uh right so it has to be rl red"
5134720,5136880," rl draw rectangle"
5136880,5148720," there's two of them"
5161120,5162160," another one for me"
5162160,5175120," what if i upset this thing"
5185760,5191680," maybe there's something in here um that there's this is just like a"
5191680,5199440," declarations right double the phone exactly this is just declaration and"
5199440,5202880," so"
5202880,5213840," there's nothing in here that may potentially link with another ray leap library or something like that"
5213840,5220080," i have a hypothesis that maybe i have to link my dll with that ray leap or something like that"
5220080,5229280," right so let me take a look at the knob.c and how we create plugin c right so"
5229280,5240960," we do position independent code right so we also don't allow undefined and stuff like that maybe this is"
5240960,5246400," this is something that we also have to do p ic uh and also we have a leaps c"
5246400,5254960," leaps c function that okay so this one is rather interesting uh so this is something that we probably have to pass to the"
5254960,5258640," to the compilers and stuff so"
5258640,5260000," yeah"
5262640,5268640," but i'm not 100% sure so let's try to add this one to c3 maybe that one is gonna actually"
5268640,5275440," do something but it has to be more like z in here right it has to be more like z"
5275440,5277040," uh"
5277040,5285440," so let me see let me see so what is it talking what is it talking about it didn't like"
5287280,5294080," so minus z is not cannot process the unknown option zr path so minus z"
5294080,5297600," send argument as a parameter to the linker"
5297600,5307120," but i mean that's exactly what this does because this is kind of similar to uh w l is that which ones"
5310400,5316240," know because w l is how you send the linker to to z"
5316240,5320560," that's kind of that's kind of a weird thing"
5320560,5326080," so is display cleared"
5328560,5332400," okay so um what we need to do"
5332400,5343600," we can try this thing uh with maybe compiling to all first and then using the linker because maybe"
5343600,5350160," something is up during linking ready right something is up during linking the relative i feel like it is"
5350160,5351520," um"
5351520,5353600," right"
5353600,5355760," i think that it is"
5356320,5359440," but i think i want to make a small break right so i need to refill my cup of tea"
5359440,5364480," and after the small break we're going to continue investigating and trying to figure out what exactly"
5364480,5367520," is with this thing"
5367520,5372400," as you can see i need some tea let's make some break and"
5372400,5378240," we're back so and we just realized that it was in fact because i was not clearing"
5378240,5385280," the background right my other plugins actually cleaned the background so let's go ahead and do that"
5386080,5393040," uh yeah where is my plugin so prop two and i suppose what i have to do in here is a clear"
5393040,5396800," background and what does it accept by the way chat"
5396800,5408960," clear background it accepts the color and i suppose color is a structure understandable uh the thing i can do"
5408960,5415680," what i'm doing here i think i think i can do something like 80 80 80 80 uh ff"
5415680,5423360," all right so now let's try to run that and there we go a single rectangle so it doesn't really"
5423360,5435760," yeah it just puts it at zero oh because i have set it right so let's actually try to center this thing i think it's going to be uh kind of interesting so we're going to start with maybe x"
5435760,5441680," maybe i'm going to even start with the flows so essentially in terms of width it's going to start"
5441680,5449200," at the half of the screen width half of the screen width and we need to know the width or the size of"
5449200,5455280," the rectangle so let's actually introduce something like uh uh maybe size right so it's going to be size 100"
5455280,5463840," like so uh we offset it by this half of the screen and then we subtract half of the size like so so the"
5463840,5470960," same thing we do with y uh the same thing we do with y but with height so and in here we just use this x and y"
5470960,5479760," and here we just use size like so and it is going to actually center it hopefully but you have to explicitly cast it to an integer"
5480720,5487680," uh honestly if i can write animations using c3 it's going to be more comfortable than using c"
5487680,5492000," i don't go so it's centered look at that look at that beauty look at that beach"
5496400,5507200," that's pretty cool i think we can now maybe implement some simple animation uh that you can render right"
5507200,5517760," into mp4 or stuff like that so let's try to render maybe um circle so draw circle i want to something like"
5517760,5527200," this so i want to implement like a circle that rotates around the center of the screen uh using a"
5527200,5533360," sign right and it just does one cycle and that's going to be the end of the animation so it basically"
5533360,5540160," smoothly loops seamlessly loops right and then we're going to render mp4 out of that and see how it works"
5540160,5545120," so this is the center and the center is going to be actually located somewhere here i suppose but"
5545920,5554400," i suppose we need to have a radius uh radius of the of the animation so i need to i need to come up with"
5554400,5561360," good names for for the things right so essentially we're going to have a center right so this is a"
5561360,5570080," center do i have an ability to draw scheisse do i yeah there we go so this is the center then we have a"
5570080,5578560," circle right that is just going around that center how do i call this thing i think i'm going to call it distance"
5578560,5584400," see i just self prop orbit okay that's another good name thank you so much so so this is orbit"
5584400,5590560," and let's say that is going to be like a 500 or something or maybe we can even do something cool by"
5590560,5596080," making it uh making it relative to width which is going to be essentially half of the width why not"
5596080,5607120," that's a good thing so in the center um so cx and cy is going to be like this uh orbit but since it's a"
5607120,5613040," radius essentially we don't have to divide it by two right it's something like that so this is the center"
5613040,5618640," this is the center well i mean it's just that then right so because it's just a center and then we can"
5618640,5629360," have a radius uh of the circle uh radius which is going to be i don't know maybe 10th uh 10th of this"
5629360,5637040," entire thing this is something that i actually kind of stole from jonathan blow uh right when he does ui"
5637040,5644800," interfaces and stuff like that he always defines his parameters as fractions of the screen width or"
5644800,5651520," height or some other stuff and i think it's fucking cool right so it's sort of like you have this"
5651520,5658000," independent measure units right and you kind of even explicitly writing them right so it's a tenth of"
5658000,5663600," the width of the screen this is a half of the width of the screen right and it feels like working"
5663600,5670880," with css almost but it's actually directly in the code all right it's not a tenth hundreds i'm sorry"
5670880,5680960," i i i don't have education so uh i don't know math all right so whatever so let's do cx"
5680960,5688000," it doesn't matter if you know math or not computer doesn't give a about your knowledge"
5688000,5693440," the program either works or it doesn't work that's it that's the only merit you can say"
5693920,5699520," whatever stupid shit you want right that's why i like programming by the way this is why i like"
5699520,5705840," programming you can be as dumb as you want you can say as dumb of the shit incorrect mathematically"
5705840,5711440," correct that's what doesn't matter you wrote some code it works you're right you're a good programmer"
5711440,5717840," what you say doesn't matter mathematicians are molding mathematicians are molding"
5718560,5725760," the code works code goes no one's talking about you know what i'm talking about so here's the regis"
5725760,5734800," and uh here we're gonna just do a rel red so that's what i'm doing and so when i draw the circle it"
5734800,5745200," wants to be this thingy maybe i can do v so then i can do something like that i think i can so and it's just"
5745200,5752640," just just where is the v yeah yeah so that seems to be good uh the best motivational code exactly exactly"
5752640,5767040," exactly right all right all right okay that looks like shit but this is just the center right so we also"
5767040,5774240," need to keep track of the current sort of like angle or not even angle but for how long the"
5774240,5780720," animation has been going that's a very interesting thing and because of that we need to manage our"
5780720,5786720," state right let's introduce the notion of the state so here is the state"
5786720,5796800," here i suppose we're gonna have like a global time global time like so and the way you're supposed to"
5796800,5805840," manage the state in panim by the way you're supposed to have a global variable uh right which points at new"
5805840,5812800," right so and then when you are initialized you're supposed to allocate that global state right so you"
5812800,5821040," do new state like this that's what you do you just allocate a new thing why is it like that why is it"
5821040,5828320," like that this is needed so you can reload the shit so when the engine is about to reload your animation"
5828320,5836560," you're supposed to return your state like this so then the engine is going to remember your state i can"
5836560,5846640," even show you that by the way uh right reload like this you press h we call the plugins pre reload and we"
5846640,5855920," take your state we reload the plugin retaining the pointer to the state and then we put that state of the"
5855920,5861600," the previous plugin back into the new plugin so essentially what you have to do in the post reload"
5861600,5870160," you have to take that old state and assign it as this state that way you do not lose a state"
5870160,5872080," between reloads of the plugin"
5872080,5882880," smart isn't it right so when you initialized you allocate some memory when it's time to reload you give"
5882880,5888560," it away to the engine engine saves that engine saves that pointer reloading the plugin give it to the"
5888560,5894800," new version of the plugin so obviously it doesn't allow you to modify the schema of the structure"
5894800,5898720," right it's kind of difficult to do but if you don't modify the scheme of the structure and only"
5898720,5904240," modify the logic of the animation it works fine actually so especially useful when you're tweaking"
5904240,5909440," parameters right so maybe we're going to be tweaking some things in here and hot reloading should be"
5909440,5915360," fine so anyways uh so that's basically what we're doing here so now we have a state and now we can"
5915360,5919920," store global time in that state and essentially we're gonna we're gonna be updating the global time"
5919920,5928800," so global time uh actually state global time we take uh environment and we just add the data time to"
5928800,5936880," here so we kind of need to know for how long we want to play our animation right so for how long a single"
5936880,5944720," cycle is going to go a single cycle is going to go well learner is already working on fixing you she"
5944720,5951360," learner is absolutely great he's one of the best developers i actually actually know right so some i"
5951360,5959840," think somebody asked me who are my favorite developers and i said jonathan blow uh george hotz learner is"
5959840,5967280," another my one of my favorite developers right so he's so devoted to this project right so he understands"
5967280,5973120," that there is some shortcomings to the project and he's eager to actually fix them and this is something"
5973120,5978320," that i deeply respect this is something that i absolutely respect to be fair this is not a critical"
5978320,5986400," issue right he didn't have to work on it right now right because we we have a workaround uh so and i feel a"
5986400,5993280," a little bit bad right so maybe i just put it to put him on the spot i'm sorry learn i didn't mean to"
5993280,5998480," i was just doing recreational programming session you don't have to fix it right away we have a work"
5998480,6003120," around so you can take your time so i really apologize for that"
6003120,6014320," uh didn't mean to put anybody's on the spot but yeah sometimes it happens anyways so we need to figure"
6014320,6021280," out um for how long we want to play our animation right so let's just say um not really animation but the"
6021280,6028400," cycle a single cycle animation right so let's say uh cycle duration and it's going to be in seconds"
6028400,6035760," let's say that the is going to last last for one second right so now with the global time we know how"
6035760,6042240," much time has passed since the beginning of the animation right uh and by the way when we reset the"
6042240,6047200," animation i suppose one of the things we want to do we want to also reset the global time right so the"
6047200,6056960," animation is actually resetting here um so and if we divide it by a single cycle we get an interpolator"
6056960,6065520," which goes from zero to one right which goes from zero to one and then we can convert this thing to an"
6065520,6075360," angle uh from two pi from zero to two pi and this is like the full cycle essentially um is that a good"
6075360,6081040," idea i think it is a good idea right so this is the angle and now from that angle we have to generate"
6081040,6088720," the actual position of the of the circle right so we have cx uh and we need to do something like px"
6089280,6101760," from cx we add math sine math sine angle multiplied by orbit uh orbit and this one it's not sine actually"
6101760,6113360," it's a cosine y sine y orbit so it's a px and py this is px and this is py and this is what gives us the"
6113360,6120720," thing that we want all right so it doesn't compile because why there's no field global time which is"
6120720,6130160," globality time okay uh all right anything else aside we probably need to import math uh is this std"
6130160,6135520," math is this std math i think it is and for the pi i think it's something like this"
6137200,6147120," oh that's pretty cool now chat are you thinking what i'm thinking are you thinking what i'm thinking"
6147120,6156240," so let's actually increase the radius of the circle i'm gonna recompile this thing all right so i probably"
6156240,6163920," have to do that slightly differently i have to run this entire thing uh as this as a sort of like a"
6163920,6173680," asynchronous thing so then later i can just rebuild the whole thing and hot reload it so let's increase"
6173680,6179600," like maybe increase the duration let's say that it should take two seconds to do this thing so it's"
6179600,6187440," it's rotating a little bit slower maybe even three seconds uh right and let's go to the orbit and"
6188800,6194880," actually say that the orbit is going to be quarter of this whole thing so we get something like that"
6194880,6204160," then uh in here we can even now modify the color we can do something like green uh right like this"
6204160,6212240," so and yeah this is what i'm talking about right so this is hot reloading capability is provided by the"
6212240,6217760," engine all right so it's provided by the engine itself which is rather cool i think"
6217760,6229600," pretty cool pretty cool pretty cool so yeah c3 is not a toy scripting language it's a serious uh"
6229600,6236000," statically typed native language and our engine is designed to work with this kind of languages"
6236000,6241280," that's why it just works right so if you can create a dll in your language you can use your language with"
6241280,6246000," this engine why are you not lying on the bat is not the new meta"
6246000,6253760," i need to think about my setup right if i want to actually stream from from from the bed"
6253760,6260960," i don't know what i'm talking about the bad stream soon maybe i don't know uh so radius let's actually"
6260960,6267920," increase the radius even more oh i didn't mean to to render it actually because it never finishes by the"
6267920,6275200," way i didn't create a finished you know condition so it would render indefinitely so you have to be"
6275200,6282480," careful we can create it though so essentially it's literally kind of the same thing right you need to"
6282480,6288320," know the interpolator and it's basically finished when the interpolator is greater or equal to one so that's"
6288320,6294720," going to be our finished condition right so we can put reload and now we can render the whole thing"
6294720,6301520," right so hopefully it's gonna yeah so it finished rendering and uh we literally just created a video"
6301520,6310240," uh with this thing right so i intentionally made it uh loop and as you can see it's looping and it's"
6310240,6317200," actual video so it's mp4 right so this is basically panium right it allows you to write these plugins"
6317200,6324160," that allow you to make procedural animations like that and then it can render it to uh to mp4 files"
6324160,6329520," and stuff like that so i created this system in case in the future i want to make you know visualized"
6329520,6336880," videos and stuff like that uh so right and i can show you my coolest animation that i made with panium"
6336880,6348480," right so it's it's it's made with panium in the style that i just showed you"
6348480,6361120," right so it's literally programmed in but in c not in c3 uh right so it's just basically turing machine"
6362000,6368960," small turing machine it's pretty cool i think it's pretty cool and you can restart it you can even stop"
6368960,6376160," it and you can actually slow down so we have delta time multiplier so as you can see it now going slower"
6376160,6382800," so you can debug your animations if you want to you can see exactly how they're played uh and stuff like"
6382800,6389360," like that so yeah and you have to be a little bit of an artist as well right to to pull that out but"
6389360,6397920," um well i mean it's an old it's an old animation so it still has expert content you can follow me there"
6397920,6414480," if you want to right but it's a shithole of a platform unfortunately so so the thing is i already"
6414480,6423600," spent two hours working on this entire thing and i can conclude that c3 is suitable for writing animations"
6423600,6431280," for engine where we use c i should replace it with blue sky uh i don't really like blue skies links"
6431280,6435680," you know what i'm talking about what the is this link can anybody tell me"
6435680,6447120," is that like can i use this as a domain does it create domain like that oh it does holy"
6447120,6455360," shit okay so it actually created i didn't know that and okay and that's why yeah so as far as"
6455360,6460720," you know one of the features of blue blue sky is that you can have custom domains right so you can"
6460720,6466080," verify i don't really know how to do that but uh you can verify them so that means you can create like a"
6466080,6471600," another layer of domain of your personal website right so if i had something like a sodium"
6472800,6481520," i don't know something sodium.com right i could say b sky verify that as a domain and on my server i"
6481520,6488720," could redirect to my blue sky or something like that is that how it's done is that how verification is done"
6488720,6496000," uh yeah ping right that's kind of interesting okay i really kind of like this system so i can probably"
6496960,6506320," replace uh replace uh dot com unfortunately there is a lot of like useful info on x.com you know there"
6506320,6512000," is also trash as well i don't know so and it doesn't do anything to moderate that because it's all freedom"
6512000,6521840," of speech freedom of trash i suppose but anyway uh so where is the tm uh x.com all right so i'm gonna put"
6521840,6535440," that thing here so and this is the lib tm right now it's using sodium blue sky or what not"
6535440,6541360," crt one o in the chat"
6543920,6556640," uh no there's control o but not crt one o oh it's a i mean come on it's not that uh so"
6556640,6567040," it's cool and all right so c3 is usable in this regards but something that c plus plus cannot survive"
6567040,6576960," is hot reloading the um um you know the virtual functions and this is something something that is"
6576960,6583760," difficult to pull off honestly this is something that is difficult to pull off uh we can now maybe"
6583760,6589840," introduce some tasks we can go ahead and actually try to use the futures that we developed on the previous"
6589840,6596800," stream right so let's let's go ahead and try to do that three c three foot uh right so here they are"
6596800,6600880," people already submitted the request it's not finished yet guys it's not even finished yet"
6600880,6608000," uh right so we have this interface uh and we can define our custom futures and what not so let me"
6608000,6619360," download it raw just like i do you do i do your mama oh i'm sorry so let's download this thing in here"
6620080,6632480," and knob dot c so i suppose what i want to do in here is c3 foot c3 it's actually just futures right so"
6632480,6642400," futures like this okay and uh if i try to simply rebuild uh-huh it doesn't like what i'm doing in here"
6643520,6650960," um because it's just um because it's just a future okay sure sure there we go so that seems to be working"
6650960,6662480," that seems to be working so that means in uh probe two i can now import future as well and use this future"
6662480,6671680," thingy so what kind of things we can actually uh implement in there what kind of things we can actually"
6671680,6678880," implement in there let's implement an interpolator task right some sort of interpolated task uh this"
6678880,6686400," is going to be struct and it's going to be um lerp right some sort of like a linear interpolator"
6686400,6695760," this is a linear interpolator and um it is going to store its current state right it is storing current"
6695760,6704960," state or maybe a pointer of the value of some sort of a value that is currently uh you know interpolating"
6704960,6710960," right so this is what it's doing learn already fixed the bug i'm actually really curious how exactly he"
6710960,6717920," fixed it so let's let's go let's actually see so maybe we can even confirm that it's fixed as well"
6717920,6726720," uh okay let's go ahead and verify it sure um so fix problem with 31 was linked so there were several"
6726720,6733600," actual fixes i'm really curious how exactly he did that so fix problem with 30 was linked for dynamic"
6733600,6742240," libraries on linux and bsd ah so so we didn't even distinguish whether we were building like a dynamic"
6742240,6748480," libraries or not dynamic libraries in case of a dynamic library we just don't include it okay so"
6748480,6756000," that's sort of like a first approach that he took then there were some modifications i suppose okay this"
6756000,6765120," he was probably fixing some of the um tests in here so another uh commit kind of similar so he's probably"
6765120,6772560," fixing tests and everything uh right nothing but okay so the main idea is probably just simply"
6772560,6780560," don't oh and he also found some bugs with macros right so because they are they're not oh this is a"
6780560,6788960," such a nasty bug damn do you guys see do you guys see that right you have several statements like that"
6790160,6797120," and it was not wrapped into the do while do you guys know why it is bad do you guys know why it is bad"
6797120,6804320," so i'm going to show you so essentially if you have something like a foo and it has like f g"
6804320,6810160," and you just call foo you expel both expect both of them to work but now imagine this"
6810160,6815680," or even like like this or some sort of a condition"
6817840,6826160," imagine what can happen so this is why when you write in macros uh in c if they have to do several"
6826160,6832160," statements you wrap them in additional scope thingy preferably do while so you can do things like that"
6832160,6840880," uh why do while instead of just blog look if you just put the blog in here look in here uh it may work"
6841680,6849360," for a while i think right so you're gonna have additional semicolon in here but then if you have"
6849360,6858880," something like full else you may not have a semicolon here so let me actually show you all right so i think"
6858880,6864720," it would be best to demonstrate that because it's a very common question so let's create a couple of"
6864720,6875120," functions in here so this is going to be uh print f right f and uh so g right g"
6875120,6880080," all right so we don't really need to run it we just need to compile it"
6880080,6889120," but i mean running it would be nice because we'll be able to then see how it is working so if i just do"
6889120,6894720," main main.c and then run the whole thing let's go to combustion errors it just worked all right so but"
6894720,6900880," it would be nice to have new lines in here right it would be nice to have a line in here so let's take"
6900880,6907520," a look at the original blog so we have this then you want to disable the whole thing you want to disable"
6907520,6915600," the whole thing uh right and you probably need to have boolean that's fine yeah but you didn't disable"
6915600,6922240," only foo got disabled now the first logical thing okay let's wrap it in scopes"
6932240,6940080," wrap it in scopes everything's fine but now what if i try to put else in here when i try to do something"
6940080,6940320," else"
6940320,6953040," you can't have semicolon between curly brace and else you can't do this kind of thing"
6956240,6963680," you can't so because this entire thing is not like a proper statement or anything so the easiest way"
6963680,6974320," to fix that is to do do while zero and only then it works that's why it's stupid i understand that"
6974320,6975840," it's kind of stupid uh"
6975840,6982240," and the problem is that it's so obscure"
6983200,6989440," and it's so unobvious that i have to answer this question every single stream where i encounter that"
6989440,6996080," i wish it was more obvious why it is like that but i mean it is what it is anyways so let's go ahead"
6996080,7003360," and try to verify this entire stuff so i'm going to go to c3 and just fetch the latest thing uh all right"
7003360,7018080," and let's rebuild it with 10 threads okay so the only modifications were in build options linker and"
7018080,7024720," compiler so that means we actually fetch the latest thing all right so let's install the whole thing now"
7024720,7032800," let's try to reproduce the problem that we had uh so i need to download all of these files that i had in"
7032800,7040160," here uh right so obviously i had empty oh i already have it i think in here so it's a here it is here it"
7040160,7046080," is okay so i can remove all of this stuff uh right so and"
7048800,7054400," it works fine it works just fine we can now go uh into c3c"
7054400,7065360," uh look into the previous commit right so because as you can see there were several of them uh maybe"
7065360,7072240," maybe even here right so here is the one so this is one fix this is another one we're going back in time"
7072960,7076240," rebuilding the previous version rebuilding the previous version"
7076240,7083040," uh install it"
7083040,7094640," go into the bug running the bug bug is there very easy to reproduce very easy to verify uh let's go back"
7098240,7099360," let's go to the master"
7099360,7104560," all right so make g10"
7104560,7112720," and after that make install we just need to wait until it links everything bug"
7112720,7118320," everything works c3c"
7127120,7129520," so uh works on"
7129520,7140800," thank you so much for fixing it so quickly"
7140800,7149520," uh can we do yeah so let's close with comments all right so that's pretty cool"
7149520,7156000," prove that prove that c3 is going is going somewhere"
7156560,7158160," it's going to take over the world"
7158160,7164080," zig and odin are in shambles i'm fucking telling you"
7164080,7166080," zig and odin are in shambles thank you thank you so much"
7166080,7171200," all right so uh that's pretty cool that's pretty cool so we have a working thingy in here"
7171200,7178160," uh try without specifying linux crt uh that's a good question actually but i mean"
7178160,7186320," that is already different bug in my opinion that is already kind of a different bug but uh we can try to"
7186320,7199680," do that as well so run it looks fine thank you guys guys language keeps improving as you use it"
7199680,7205120," like literally in front of your eyes it's getting better and but you can see that"
7206720,7211280," it's it's it's just like right in front of your eyes it's just like it's magically becoming better and"
7211280,7216720," better and better you don't even have to wait for releases or anything it's amazing i'm telling you"
7216720,7223120," can your zig do that can your odin do that i don't think so can you see do that"
7223120,7229120," but the fucking c can't even finally finalize the embed thingy they still don't have it finally"
7229120,7233360," maybe they still have it already have it finalized but i don't really know but i mean it's so slow"
7233360,7236240," this thing right in front of us getting better"
7236240,7244960," thank you so much it's amazing actually it's amazing self-learning language exactly exactly"
7247520,7258320," uh what language are working i don't really work on any language but i'm working with c3 right so"
7258320,7263600," there's a c3 programming language and we're just using that so we're just exploring this language we're"
7263600,7272800," testing it uh right so i'm essentially like a unpaid qa for c3 i'm just like doing random"
7272800,7278320," with this language discovering new bugs right so and potentially reporting them there was a discussion"
7278320,7286960," in the c3 discord about how enums should work yeah so enums in c3 is a really painful topic for me"
7287840,7295920," because i understand what um the designer was going for i understand and it's a good thing right because"
7295920,7303680," um you really want to associate enums with elements of certain array and i suppose the"
7303680,7312080," the intent was kind of formalized exactly that but it just like turned out really weird and maybe i just"
7312080,7319600," didn't get used to that but it evokes so many emotions in me i don't i don't really know so"
7319600,7327760," because it's a very common thing actually that you have an enum uh right and then you kind of have a"
7327760,7334400," bunch of arrays a bunch of tables that associate the elements of the enum like in c it's usually like"
7334400,7342880," that like count foos right you have a bunch of tables table one count foos and they are of different"
7342880,7350560," types right they are of different types and so on and so forth some of them even maybe even structures"
7350560,7357440," some sort of a structure right and you have all these tables and you're constantly looking up uh different"
7357440,7366240," things so foo uh like one foo two foo three and so on and so forth and you're constantly looking up certain"
7366240,7378160," things like that right i understand the intent but um strictly attaching all of these tables to definition of"
7378160,7386400," enumeration means that you can't comfortably have more tables potentially defined outside of the library"
7386400,7393280," where enum is defined you see what i'm talking about like i understand the intent but the way"
7393280,7399840," syntactically and semantically it is implemented first of all it is confusing second of all it's kind of"
7399840,7410080," restrictive so it's just like i understand but the way it's done it's kind of i don't know"
7410080,7419120," it's it's difficult right so because if i'm trying to criticize this feature i'm sort of criticizing the"
7419120,7425600," idea of associating enums with tables but i'm really not i just not fun of how exactly it's implemented"
7426240,7431040," i think actually moving the associated areas into the enum is a good idea because you can assert that"
7431040,7438400," the enums is continuous but having well okay that's a good point but having uh separate stuff c like would"
7438400,7445040," be good yeah i see i see what you mean it's it's this famous problem that enums can be sort of like a"
7445040,7452560," you know with holes right so because you can all of a sudden somewhere here you say okay this is 10 now"
7453200,7460080," right and so here was zero one and suddenly 10 so the count is actually not three but it's like"
7460080,7466560," 12 all of a sudden right so uh there's a num in on flags in a number right oh there is also"
7466560,7476480," oh in jay in jay there is a num flags in the number array or where i'm actually really curious is that a giant"
7476480,7488320," what i think um so modules uh i'm saying just like oh the idea yeah huh but yeah i i don't know i don't"
7488320,7498400," know i don't know so okay but it's not super critical right so it's not like it restricts you from doing"
7498400,7506320," anything because you're just not forced to use that right so essentially what you can do is that"
7506320,7514240," you can just define in the num uh right i don't remember how you specify the underlying type so"
7514240,7520000," something like that probably right and you can just like use it yourself right you can just use it"
7520000,7525120," this up let's thumb up uh or something for learner okay let me see let me see so what's what's up with"
7525120,7528480," that what's what's that um"
7531920,7536000," oh yeah yeah let's let's give you some that that's true thank you thank you so much"
7536000,7551360," he's doing god's work he's doing god's work all right so let's go let's a go um so what i was doing"
7551360,7560480," i wanted to see uh if c3 survives the hot reloading also with dynamic uh with virtual table"
7561120,7567200," i would suspect that it doesn't right so because making this survive is actually a lot of work uh"
7567200,7572400," right and i doubt that any language designer actually will put that work c++ doesn't give a"
7572400,7581760," shit right so when um so yeah let's see i just want to try that nonetheless because it's a very specific"
7581760,7591040," case uh that is not the case for a lot of people all right but i wonder does c3 even"
7591040,7598640," allow you to do anything with its virtual table even if it is virtual table or is it something else"
7598640,7605120," does it allow you to just like inspect it or patch it up or some stuff like that because if it does this"
7605120,7610720," is a game changer honestly that's already way better than c++ because in c++ you just have a virtual table"
7610720,7614800," you don't know what it is but it's just there and you can't do anything with it right if you if you're"
7614800,7621120," doing some low level hackery low level platform specific hackery good luck just straight of good"
7621120,7626720," luck uh and different compilers on the same platform may generate completely different code for virtual"
7626720,7633360," tables so it's not formalized in any way it's all hidden from you you're too dummy to know all of that"
7633360,7639920," you too dummy to know all that i hope to load my game code but the entire state is on the exe why"
7639920,7646000," would you want to keep the state of the dll and so because the engine and dll is separated right the"
7646000,7650960," engine is obstructed away from specific animations because we want to have just an engine and then"
7651520,7658320," the animations right uh right so and we also have to reload in the code and stuff like that so anyways"
7658320,7660800," you exe"
7660800,7671040," so uh what we want to do in here right so let's go into the prop two um so this is the lerp and we are"
7671040,7679920," going to towards the goal right so that's the goal value uh we're usually going with a certain speed"
7680560,7690720," all right so i didn't even know right so this is the sort of place that we're modifying all right"
7690720,7697680," this is a sort of the place that we're modifying then this is from a to b we're going from a to b"
7697680,7706560," t is the current value right t is the current value and the question is uh for how long we're going"
7707280,7715280," so duration yes so that's basically what we're doing here and this is a future right so by itself this"
7715280,7725360," entire thing is a future so what i'm thinking now is that we need to create the method so let's actually"
7725360,7732160," let the compiler tell me what i have to create in here uh right so let's go so future is not fully"
7732160,7738800," implemented that's oh yeah so it's it's already telling me so it needs a poll uh methods if you take"
7738800,7746000," a look at this thing so it's a poll um that's kind of the thing we need in here uh probe two"
7750000,7767920," so any in c3 is equivalent to void star but on top of being void star it also uh stores a tag of the"
7767920,7774880," type it is currently containing so the type of this thing is known at runtime actually it is known at"
7774880,7780560," runtime this is actually a very cool type i think jai also has any which is kind of similar right it's a"
7780560,7785840," pointer plus a tag of the type and it's generated automatically by the compiler so you can sort of"
7785840,7792320," like inspect what kind of type it is right so it's very useful honestly it's very useful and uh the way"
7792320,7800480," we can do that we can have we can store the lerp uh somewhere in here right so here is the our animation"
7800480,7813200," that we're currently playing in here um and we can as we update as we update things uh in here like this"
7813200,7824480," uh we can take the animation and we can pull it but then paul needs a data and as the data we can just"
7824480,7829200," provide a pointer to the environment alex over things thank you so much for your answer question"
7829200,7835680," thank you thank you right so this is basically what we're doing um yeah so we just keep pulling it we"
7835680,7847440," just keep pulling it uh and the lerp itself right as it pulls what are we doing here we need to update"
7847440,7853920," it's sort of it's sort of like a place right um so what we're going to be doing in here we're just going"
7853920,7861840," to be doing um self b minus self a right we are multiplying it by t"
7861840,7867360," and that's basically the value that's basically the value"
7871920,7879520," it's not particularly great it's not particularly great in the sense that t is normalized t is normalized"
7879520,7887520," but we kind of need to um transform it into seconds right so because we have a specific direction"
7887520,7897760," uh duration so transform it to seconds we need to i suppose multiply it by the duration right so here's the"
7897760,7901840," duration uh right and that's now transformed into seconds uh right and that's now transformed into"
7901840,7910240," seconds then we need to take data so this one is an environment right so in environment we have"
7910240,7916880," delta time and we're adding the seconds of the delta time to this thing right so and then we need to"
7916880,7925360," normalize it back by dividing it by duration and that gives us the new t so to speak so that gives us the"
7925360,7935600," the new t that's how we are updating it um so interestingly enough if uh self t"
7935600,7945760," self t is greater or equal to one we need to stop the animation unfortunately the animation is not"
7945760,7950320," stopped well yeah"
7953040,7959360," since this thing is not returning anything it is not returning anything we have to"
7959360,7968400," can i just like return true is that possible for me to return true like that right because it's any"
7968400,7976720," but any is a pointer right but i can simply allocate this thing uh on the temporary memory so let's just"
7976720,7982800," try to return true and see what the compiler will tell us okay so anyway after we updated this time"
7983040,7992000," after we update this time uh i'm going to do self b minus self a and i'm going to just multiply it by self t"
7992000,7996800," and that's the new value that we have to put into the place"
7996800,8006960," like this right so we are updating this place and after that depending on whether we're done or not we must return"
8006960,8016160," seven different things we might uh either return true or new because it's not finished yet so yeah"
8016160,8024640," um any is used to indicate whether the the future is finished or not right if it's new it's not finished"
8024640,8030080," if it has something it's finished but when the future doesn't return anything if it doesn't return anything"
8030880,8034240," like it's unclear what exactly do we return to indicate that it's finished"
8034240,8042000," something that is not new but what exactly um so can i just return like one in that case"
8042000,8046800," uh we need to see let's actually try to compile and see what is going to tell"
8046800,8055040," so return into any you can't convert into any um so i want to see how exactly do you do that so"
8057200,8066240," any any any are you okay are you okay are you okay any any cast okay optionally cast um"
8066240,8076880," any to int all right so there is a returns an option value of type if the any value loosely"
8078000,8089120," yeah can i just like man i don't know i can always just like a tclone null so essentially the clone will"
8089120,8097920," allocate uh a pointer in a temporary memory and put null in there so this thing is basically a pointer but"
8097920,8104560," it's a pointer that points to a new pointer something like that it's kind of stupid but i mean it might work"
8104560,8110320," right so it's kind of like a downside of the current future library uh right so and in here obviously"
8110320,8120560," this one has to be self t return self that's not a bad idea yeah so let's return self i suppose"
8120560,8127120," as an indicator yeah that's not bad i think thank you thank you so much"
8127840,8138240," right so now we have to switch env uh right and if the case is environment we just do that"
8138240,8145440," uh right otherwise we can say this is unreachable"
8145440,8153280," something like that because we expect specifically environment in here so what does it want in here"
8153280,8158400," a new poll okay so it can fail oh this one is interesting so this can fail"
8158400,8163120," but we don't fail we know that we don't fail so we're gonna actually enrap it"
8163120,8172720," um oh you can also do these kind of things right and it's not like we are going to dereference that pointer or anything"
8172720,8180720," uh we just need to have something that is not null uh right so that's yeah okay so that that seems to be like a working strategy i suppose"
8181520,8187840," right so this is like a really bad part of this interface which i'm not a huge fan of but i mean"
8187840,8194320," it is what it is so anyways um so we need a like kind of a way to construct a thing"
8194320,8197360," so how we're going to be constructing so let's create the maybe"
8197360,8201280," macro maybe function should be enough so this is going to be the future"
8202080,8209840," uh right so uh right so lerp uh let's call it lerp and it's going to accept things like a"
8209840,8218400," b and duration right so you want to move thing from one place to another one right so that's what you want to do"
8218400,8228000," so and what we're going to be doing we're going to be constructing a future out of that right so this is going to be a"
8230080,8239440," be duration and you also have to specify the place like because we're setting that place in here"
8239440,8246400," so this is going to be place place like so um all right so is it going to work and we forgot the"
8246400,8252320," semicolon that's fine that is totally fine and this is not future this is lerp"
8253040,8259280," right there we go that seems to be working i really like this clone idea where you can just take a value"
8259280,8265200," and put it onto an allocator or heap or anything and just instantly get a point of that i think rust"
8265200,8271520," has something similar uh but i really like it just makes it easier right so um yeah i really like it"
8272960,8278880," so anyways uh so anyways uh here we're just doing poll um right we're just doing poll"
8278880,8284800," and i suppose we can just use the value of the t in here"
8284800,8293280," so let's in a state where is the state we're going to have this thing which is going to be t"
8294560,8299920," right and in plugin init we are creating"
8299920,8309760," anim right so the current anim and we do lerp we take a pointer to the state of t right so it's appointed"
8309760,8319600," to the state of t and we're modifying it from zero to i don't know to one during so there was a duration"
8319600,8324240," right so cycle duration during the cycle duration so that's what we're creating in here"
8324240,8328400," um that's what we're creating here so we're derping"
8328400,8335920," this specific value from zero to one during the cycle duration so that's what we're doing essentially"
8335920,8343440," okay all right and now instead of using t this t what we're going to be doing we're going to be using"
8343440,8352960," state t like this right and that state c is animated by this thing you see it's animated by this thing"
8352960,8360240," so now uh if i try to rebuild everything is rebuilding so now if i try to run uh this entire stuff it is"
8360240,8364400," animated and it's finished a single cycle"
8366560,8374800," so it is it finished a single cycle here's an interesting thing uh we can do a different kind"
8374800,8384800," of lerp so plug in it so what if we now lerp from one to zero right what if we look from one to zero"
8384800,8389920," it's going to be moving probably in a different direction now it is moving in a different direction"
8391040,8398880," and it stops and by the way we can even do something interesting in here um the way we checked whether"
8398880,8408560," it's finished or not yeah it's finished when this animation is finished um and that means we have to"
8408560,8413040," do something like that finished um"
8416640,8427200," not equal to no action"
8427200,8440640," what a goofy language um and i'm saying that without any bad intent right i'm saying that without any bad"
8440640,8443600," intent it's goofy it's goofy in a good way"
8446480,8452080," uh anyways so if it's not finished yeah so as soon as it's finished it returned that and that"
8452080,8462560," finished could be part of the state right so struct state uh finished and when we check in whether it's"
8462560,8470800," finished we just returned finished and when you reset uh we do state finished false so that's how we're"
8470800,8478400," going to be doing that and when we reset by the way uh we also have to reset this kind of thing i suppose"
8478400,8486720," so that's how we reset things honestly since we are doing the futures and stuff like that i think global"
8486720,8494960," time is not needed anymore right so let's go to the compilation errors uh so error so it's a 78 no need to do that"
8495680,8501040," and 95 no need to do that as well right so when we're doing that we're leaking a little bit of a"
8501040,8508560," memory in the temporary allocator but who cares uh right so we have a lot of memory we have 16 gigabytes"
8508560,8511920," just buy more ram stop being poor um anyways"
8513840,8520880," what i wanted actually i wanted to have another future which is sort of like a sequential future"
8520880,8527200," which is sort of like a sequential future let's implement that so it takes several futures and just"
8527200,8535600," sequentially execute them um that's what i want so let's have struct sec and in here we're going to have"
8536240,8544080," essentially a bunch of futures right so futures and also maybe an index which one we're currently working"
8544080,8551120," with right which one we're currently working with uh and yeah so where is the poll i'm gonna grab this"
8551120,8563120," thing so this is a sec and if the index is greater than the futures len that's instantly it's finished"
8563120,8571600," right so we can return itself uh if it's not finished uh what we do we just take the current feature in here"
8571600,8579680," so here's the current feature and we pull it with this environment we just pull it and if this thing"
8579680,8587200," uh has returned something right so we probably want to do something like that and if it returns something"
8587840,8600480," we essentially increment this thing uh and after that um after that we have to"
8600480,8606720," check this thing one more time right we have to check this thing one more time"
8606720,8615600," and otherwise return no right so did we ran out of futures it's done we didn't we pull the current one"
8615600,8622080," if the current one is done we increment the index did we ran out of the features this time uh we didn't"
8622080,8627360," okay this is not finished so that's basically what it is right that's basically what it is and in here"
8627360,8633760," we're going to create the constructor uh all right so it's going to be future uh just sec uh and it's going"
8633760,8640720," so we're going to accept basically futures in here just a bunch of futures uh and we can simply return"
8640720,8652160," tclone um sec futures futures futures this is several of them futures like this"
8654480,8666960," is it compiles for the semicolon what do we want uh futures because this is self forgot about the self"
8666960,8675680," something to do using would be kind of great i think something to do using so tclone"
8677440,8688400," uh so where's the tclone cannot toxicity because it's not implemented so this is future all right"
8688400,8696000," cool uh so we have a sequence why do we need that why do we need that because now when we do init"
8696960,8704400," what we can do what we can do actually is sequence i wonder if we can do something like this so"
8709120,8718080," you go from zero to one and from one to zero but this time twice as fast so it's going to be"
8718080,8722400," or maybe like four times as fast"
8722400,8731280," so that's pretty cool so we have combinations of these asynchronous tasks that's what we have in here"
8731280,8738480," a combination of these asynchronous tasks uh all right so if i try to run this entire thing and it out of"
8738480,8746880," bounce nice one uh i think i know what exactly happened it's something with a sec poll yeah"
8746880,8752640," well at least this is actually kind of great it tells us where exactly we did the fokey walking"
8752640,8760240," so it was a 53 okay that's that's pretty cool um so what does it say exactly source unavailable"
8760240,8766800," something something no zero in it maybe i don't freaking know but i think um"
8767600,8773280," self parameter like self and python yeah i guess but you can actually code whatever you want"
8773280,8779840," um so i can call it your mom for instance"
8779840,8784640," and it's going to work"
8788720,8795360," can you python do that i don't fucking think so you can just code web"
8795360,8802080," uh so self index in the cons uh cons what what the fuck is cons"
8802080,8810720," anyways so i don't think it is out of bounds because i would expect the sec"
8812480,8818000," um to be um to be like this thing should zero initialize it i think this thing should zero initialize"
8818000,8827200," it my hypothesis by the way my hypothesis is that the futures themselves are not uh correct"
8829360,8840640," so when you do plug unit where this array is defined it's a temporary uh array it exists only for the uh"
8840640,8846960," for this specific uh statement that's probably why but at the same time like i don't know"
8846960,8851920," is this how you do that again it's a temporary array that's kind of the problem"
8852480,8863040," so how long does it exist i don't know it's kind of bizarre one thing you can do is to just have a list"
8863040,8868080," but it's done can i tick on it uh as well"
8870400,8878480," um something something something like that and that this can be um can only have constant elements"
8878480,8886080," untyped list untyped list untyped list okay so what if i do it's a future uh yeah so it's just a slice"
8886080,8894480," uh and now it's a pointer and i want to dereference that point okay so what if i dereference that one"
8895360,8905680," yeah so i feel like that's the thing is that it's uh it was not located anywhere right so and i feel"
8905680,8912160," like i also have to do something like this uh conversion from array"
8912160,8922480," yeah that's the thing so by putting star in here i mean that this is array of the size of the amount"
8922480,8928080," of elements this is how i understand it at least right so that means it will take and allocate"
8928080,8935520," enough memory for this entire array and it will turn us a pointer to the type of future two array so"
8935520,8941120," basically star means that the exact number here is going to be taken automatically by the compiler"
8941120,8949920," right and since it's a pointer to this specific array it can be automatically casted to uh any or a"
8949920,8955840," pointer of the interface or anything like that or a slice right so in case of sec it accepts a slice"
8955840,8961680," pointer to an array can be automatically casted to slice that's why it worked if i understand c3"
8961680,8968240," correctly this could work if i understand c correctly because i don't know all the nuances but i think"
8968240,8974080," it makes sense i think this entire stuff makes sense actually that's pretty cool that's pretty cool"
8974960,8978480," anyways uh right so let's try to run that and i was right"
8978480,8987920," and it it crashed anyway right so it crashed anyway but that's already a different problem"
8987920,8993760," that's already a different problem so it's 54 but it worked so that means i understood the problem"
8993760,9006080," correctly uh right so prob 254 uh huh just equals so but that's already a different problem again we"
9006080,9012720," might as well actually combine those things together look at that look at this nice code look at this nice"
9012720,9023360," mother flipping code uh so yeah we can introduce some shit in here like sec finished"
9023360,9032480," your mom uh and basically just move this entire thing there all right"
9035200,9041200," and that will enable us to um your mom"
9041200,9051360," if your mom finished return your mom you see it's that it's that easy if your mom finished"
9051360,9055920," return your mom all right look at that look at that chat look at that chat"
9059440,9067120," absolutely absolutely epic render this render this it's done looking at the mp4"
9067120,9073200," uh this is mp4 and just like it didn't finish"
9073200,9081920," i know why because we didn't do that in a reset so we have a duplicate code we have a little bit of a"
9081920,9091200," duplicate code chat plug in it so uh we can do something like uh i don't know what reset uh anim"
9091200,9098720," right where we do this kind of thing uh all right so we reset a new and this is where we can actually"
9098720,9108880," clean up the um the animation and stuff right but in any case so here is the reset a new and in here we"
9108880,9117200," also do a reset a new right it will just reconstruct the tree of the tasks one more time"
9117200,9125840," all right reset a new so it's it's a sequential thing and again i can actually like add more things in"
9125840,9133040," here right so now i can combine these tasks together right so that's what i can do i can combine"
9133040,9141920," them together uh now it's very easy for me to add another uh another you know circle moving around"
9141920,9149360," and stuff like that right so it should be super easy uh okay so if i try to run that seems to be working"
9149360,9156080," and goes back i do reset so and i feel like if you do reset you have to clean up the temporary allocator"
9156080,9162160," completely right you have to clean it up because like all of that stuff is not needed anymore right"
9162160,9165440," so you can actually quite safely like remove all of that stuff"
9165440,9175360," okay makes sense to me so now let's try to add another circle in there let's try to add another"
9175360,9182400," circle in there so we have in the state uh where is the state struct state we have t"
9183840,9188640," and this is the state of the animation of one circle let's actually introduce something like t1"
9188640,9194080," and t2 right and those are going to be the uh so the state of the animations of"
9194080,9198640," two separate circles right so let's go to the compilation errors let's go to the compilation errors"
9198640,9204960," and obviously uh we renamed something so it's not going to work so that means here we are modifying"
9204960,9212240," this thing we want to do a similar thing for the second one also sequentially right"
9213200,9219920," but we don't have a second root task we have to play these two things in parallel"
9219920,9229040," like so so we need to create uh we need to create a thing that allows us to play those things in"
9229040,9236560," parallel excuse me oh my god all right and it's also going to be a future that doesn't pull them"
9236560,9240960," sequentially but it pulls them simultaneously all at once"
9240960,9248720," you see you see what i'm talking about right so something like that and um i suppose it's kind of"
9248720,9254800," similar in terms of like how we allocate memory for it we just do t clone and doing that t clone thingy"
9254800,9261360," is kind of tedious so i think we'll have to kind of somehow tuck it behind the the constructors and stuff"
9261360,9270880," like that right so but anyways uh any case let's go to the struct sec uh and let's introduce parallel sec"
9273360,9281680," so um well and we don't need an index in here because we're going to be actually going through all of"
9281680,9295680," them uh so let's take the poll uh-huh so this is parallel and we don't need that so what we do"
9296320,9302960," we just iterate each individual feature future your mom futures"
9302960,9310880," so we're going to take it by a pointer like so and we just pull them all right so future poll"
9310880,9319760," with an environment so and it may fail obviously and then if it is not finished right if it's equal to no"
9320960,9325920," we should probably have some sort of a variable called finished which is initially true but as"
9325920,9331040," soon as you encounter one future that is not finished you say okay this is not finished and"
9331040,9336480," that's what that's what you return right so that's how you run them in parallel your mom variable i mean"
9336480,9341760," it's basically self right it's this or self or something like that i called it your mom just to"
9341760,9347280," demonstrate that you can call it anything right so somebody asked it in the chat so and now i keep"
9347280,9354960," demonstrating because they said oh it's like python for me the syntax is the language i don't separate"
9354960,9361440," syntax and semantic so to help out these kind of people i'm now calling self your mom right so in"
9361440,9369760," some places we actually use self uh like in here but in here we use your mom so so and yeah we have to"
9369760,9380240," return null right if uh finished return your mom otherwise return null something like that all right"
9380240,9384560," so that's what we're doing here in the front that's what we're doing anyway so now we have to create a"
9384560,9393200," constructor uh right and it's it's similar right it's kind of similar uh so let's fucking go"
9394320,9405520," uh parallel so futures and stuff like that so state t uh 137 that's what i'm talking about so um let's"
9405520,9411040," actually factor out this entire stuff into separate function because we're going to be drawing several"
9411040,9422000," circles let's create a function something like orbit circle where we're going to be actually putting all"
9422000,9430160," all of that stuff so i think clearing the background has to be the first thing then t should be a"
9430160,9438320," parameter t must be a parameter like this and let's move this entire stuff in here so we're orbiting the"
9438320,9447280," circle something like that so here is t and we also apparently need to uh need an environment so that's totally fine um"
9447280,9458480," um yep so orbit circle environment state t1 and then we're going to have state t2 i also want to be able"
9458480,9465920," to customize the orbit and the radius right so because of that i'm going to take it away all right and i'm"
9465920,9474400," going to put them in here and so this becomes uh radius and orbit and we're going to accept them as a parameters"
9474400,9480960," float uh float uh radius radius radius and orbit"
9480960,9485840," and i think another thing i also want to customize is the color"
9485840,9492640," uh right i want to have different colors for those things so this is the color color put it like that"
9492640,9499200," and this becomes a color so then later i can actually assign different parameters for those things"
9500320,9508480," so radius for a second uh circle is going to be i think smaller let's actually say it's two"
9508480,9513920," orbit is going to be kind of closer i think it's going to be like 10 and it's going to be random"
9513920,9516880," right so it's going to be red like this"
9520880,9526400," okay so in here i think that's about it that's about it so let's try to compile this entire thing"
9526400,9532880," it doesn't like something in here because i forgot to define the color okay so that's what we have in"
9532880,9539440," here uh what else do we have in here expected three arguments in here three more arguments didn't i provide"
9539440,9549200," okay yeah so i have to do radius orbit color like this all right that's cool uh and when we do"
9549200,9554880," reset anim so that's what we're doing we're running these two things in um"
9554880,9563280," yeah in parallel the thing i want to do with the second one is that i want to run from zero to one"
9563920,9572000," twice as long as the duration or maybe actually for as long as this thing so i'm going to sum up"
9572000,9580000," this thing and this thing so the second one is going to be slower and closer to the center right and"
9580000,9585360," these two things is going to go for as long as this entire full cycle of the second circle and all of"
9585360,9590720," that has to happen simultaneously right all of that has to happen simultaneously okay so let's go"
9590720,9595280," and it does nothing so the second is not drawn at all"
9595280,9601280," did we use parallel i think i know what is going on"
9601280,9613920," yeah copy pasting be careful when when you copy paste right so now it should happen in parallel"
9615360,9620720," the second one is going to be able to do what is going on in parallel so i'm going to be able to"
9620720,9621920," see the next one is going on in parallel so the second one is going on in parallel so i'm going to"
9621920,9623920," see the next one is going on in parallel so i'm going to see the next one is going on in parallel"
9623920,9627440," so that's actually actually kind of cool"
9627440,9634320," so you can combine them together and it's just like and then you can you can render it if you want to"
9634320,9642880," so let's make a video out of that mp4 video uh all right so and let's just open it up and this is a video mp4 by the way mp4"
9642880,9652560," really mp4 very cool and again so this engine didn't didn't know what language the plugins will be written"
9652560,9654560," uh right"
9654560,9670160," is that a mother flippin c4 joke oh 14 times c4 jokes maxing c4"
9670160,9682640," we need to get to 100 it's it's a very creative joke it's a very correct this joke is a blast holy"
9682640,9696640," c4 maxing um so anyways this joke is a blast bro telling me so the real thing in here"
9697760,9705360," we we can even actually make uh like a forever um future that resets the future"
9705360,9713200," constantly as it's finished it resets it but we don't have a reset in the interface of the future"
9713200,9719840," so it may not work that easily but anyways uh we can actually reset uh you know manually i think"
9722000,9727520," if we do something like that right so i have yeah i can just press q every time it leaks a little bit"
9727520,9731920," of a memory but this is because we don't clean the temporary locator but it's not that big of a deal"
9731920,9737360," on this thing this is a really cool animation i really like it"
9740960,9748800," so uh let me try to do hot reloading right let me try to do hot reloading will the hot reloading work"
9748800,9755520," right because this is something that c plus plus can't do and i honestly expect the c3 can't do that"
9755520,9762160," either right because it's just generally too difficult to do it like that so for instance i want to change the"
9762160,9768880," color i want the green one to be blue right so what i do is i recompile this entity and i want to reload it"
9768880,9775120," and it crashed right so that's understandable yeah it's a yeah yeah that's cool that's cool that's cool"
9775120,9784160," so the reason why right is that um i think it depends on how virtual tables are implemented in there"
9784720,9791040," it's just like very much depends on how virtual tables are implemented um and we have in a state"
9791040,9797920," right in the state we have this future which is a sort of like a typed pointer"
9797920,9804720," right and somewhere there it probably generates a virtual table and within this pointer it also stores"
9804720,9812000," yeah it also stores the pointer to the virtual table but since we reloaded the whole thing"
9812000,9819360," we reloaded the whole thing the pointer to the virtual table is now invalid so you try to de-reference"
9819360,9825520," that pointer to the virtual table and you you get nothing right so because as as you reloaded the"
9825520,9830080," virtual table just moving around in the memory you can't really find it anymore so and it's the same"
9830080,9837760," with c++ c++ can't hot reload that either um and in c++ we were theorizing how would you even do that"
9837760,9844880," uh like you you probably need to patch something within the virtual table and the virtual table"
9844880,9854080," itself in c3 probably not even exposed or anything like that so i don't even know how to fix that in c3"
9854080,9862160," so in c in prc how we do that is that instead of these virtual methods we actually use enumerations"
9862880,9870400," we actually use enumerations and uh a specific function that you need to call specific polymorphia"
9870400,9877440," function is actually indexed within that table so when the uh plugin gets reloaded the index within"
9877440,9883840," that table stays valid even though the table itself moves in the memory so we solve that by actually"
9883840,9889920," exposing this virtual table that we coded manually to the programmer so they can patch it up or not even"
9889920,9895520," patch it up but just like refer to the elements of that table as an index so that's one thing way to"
9895520,9900800," do that and like i don't expect languages to actually provide this kind of functionality"
9900800,9905120," because nobody really does that but if there were languages that do that that would be actually kind"
9905120,9912000," of cool right does anybody know do we have like a professional c3 developers is there any api that"
9912000,9918320," exposes the the virtual table that c3 uses or maybe it's on the virtual table but something like"
9918320,9923440," can i have an access to this like to the exact implementation of these dynamic methods and"
9923440,9931200," stuff like that or is it all obscure and hidden from the programmer um because i feel like if c3"
9931200,9936240," actually allow you to do this kind of stuff it would be extremely useful um but i don't know"
9937120,9944880," so there's some reflection i remember ask gpt yeah sure"
9944880,9951760," c3 allows both compile time and runtime reflection during compile time the type information may be"
9951760,9957520," directly used as compile time constant the same data is then available dynamically at one time okay"
9958640,9968080," compile time properties uh so we have a line of associated element x x x x name of uh members of members"
9968080,9974720," of is a rather interesting parent of params size of values okay"
9974720,9987520," inner so the return the type id of an inner type ah so things like array bit struct kind of kind of"
9988640,9995040," uh members of all available for bit structs okay names of returns the names oh this one is cool"
9995040,9997360," this one is cool actually plans of"
9997360,10004480," uh our parameters so you can have oh this one is cool actually so you can"
10004480,10012720," that's it that's a very cool level of a reflection and it's compile time as well so i can do that at"
10012720,10017760," runtime and compile time right the compile time i can just like take the type of the first argument of"
10017760,10028640," what a base language on this thing what a base language um yeah compile time function"
10028640,10037840," but nothing about dynamic i suppose all right so yeah the word dynamic on the like you know occurs only in"
10037840,10047600," here um yeah it's pretty cool so my verdict uh my verdict uh i you definitely can"
10047600,10057600," use c3 instead of c plus plus but instead of c right in c we had to implement our own sort of virtual table"
10057600,10067600," right and until you can kind of like control the way the dynamic is done i don't think it can really"
10067600,10075040," replace c right i think there should be standardized way to modify the the virtual table stuff the internal"
10075040,10082560," representation of the virtual table and whatnot but again not many languages do that at all so i don't"
10082560,10082720," know"
10082720,10087040," so i don't know i don't know all right"
10087040,10094240," it's useful it's useful so i suppose all the c3 developers kind of left the chat so"
10094240,10099280," nobody really knows if you can have an access to that internal virtual table of c3 or not"
10100000,10106560," so yeah we'll see i'll try to explore that and maybe maybe if i find something interesting i'll do"
10106560,10112560," a separate video on that uh to be fair surely you could also implement your own v tables in c3 or c plus"
10112560,10120560," plus if you wish i guess i guess in that sense you can say that it both c3 and c plus plus are kind of like c"
10121360,10129520," in in that regard but yeah but i just wish if they exposed how the internally worked"
10129520,10136960," the error message pointed to internal code files oh i didn't notice that so let's actually take a look"
10136960,10143440," look at that so they still have it or do i have to reproduce that now i have to reproduce that okay"
10143440,10152240," so let's see um so this is noba oh i probably have it somewhere here yeah okay so"
10157200,10162960," it's a built-in it's a built-in ah it's not really internal ones they are not internal these are standard"
10162960,10170320," library this is just standard library so it's the point to print backstrace to the point to the code"
10170320,10174960," that actually generated this i think structs file system file"
10174960,10185120," struct what or go out yeah i didn't read your previous message i'll go to the linux way and make"
10185120,10191600," your own v tables okay okay i see it so i only saw this struct file system type message and didn't"
10191600,10198080," see the previous one anyway i guess that was fun uh i guess that was fun uh so thank you so much for"
10198080,10203360," all the subscriptions added server six thank you thank you thank you have a good one and i see you all for"
10203360,10211040," in the next recreation program session with ahu and mr azuzin all right love you"
