959940,989920," Thank you."
989940,1019920," Thank you."
1019940,1049920," Thank you."
1049940,1079920," What's going on here."
1079940,1109920," Thank you."
1109940,1139920," Thank you."
1139940,1169920," Thank you."
1169940,1199920," Some of them."
1199940,1229920," Thank you."
1229940,1259920," Thank you."
1259940,1289920," Thank you."
1289940,1319920," Thank you."
1319940,1349920," Thank you."
1349940,1379920," Thank you."
1379940,1409920," Thank you."
1409920,1439900," Thank you."
1439900,1447440," under all their states. Even if the action they choose to do is pepega. Makes sense. In my testing,"
1447440,1452660," this made pepega-ness of the agents drop a lot faster, but there's no way to test it empirically,"
1452660,1463360," so with the same config. All right, that's very interesting. So there's also a comment here,"
1464160,1470880," and here is the code. So we're generating trees. There should be a gene for every combination of"
1470880,1474240," states in the environment. So we're iterating through all the states, we're iterating through"
1474240,1486280," all the environments, and yeah, I see what you're doing here. And then we're just filling them up."
1486280,1493160," Okay. Then we are removing this thing. All right, we're removing this thing."
1493160,1499320," Mate engine. As long as we copy all the genes in order, the invariant of state plus."
1499320,1510600," This is interesting. So we iterate through all of the genes, and then we take the parents. Oh, okay,"
1510600,1516680," I see. So we basically iterate through all of the genes, and we alternate between the parents with"
1516680,1529160," the probability of 50%. Yeah. All right. So then we mutate the agents. Instead of completely mangling"
1529160,1534280," the genes, just change some characteristics. Since the condition is that we ensure every combination of"
1534280,1538600," states in the environment has a gene, the only thing we can mutate is action and the next state."
1540600,1549320," Okay, that's actually a pretty cool idea. Yeah. So then we also remove states count and genes count,"
1549320,1556840," because they become kind of obsolete. All right, that's a very interesting idea. But I think we need"
1556840,1566680," a way to actually confirm that they start to converge a little bit faster. Right. We need some way to"
1567960,1575640," verify that. So what I'm thinking, maybe we can collect some information, right? Let's actually"
1575640,1584920," simulate, let's actually train them for, I don't know, maybe like 40 generations collect their the time,"
1584920,1592520," maybe plot it, right? Maybe plot it and see at which point the curve actually flattens,"
1592520,1598760," right? Because at some point it will start flattening. Right. Then we're going to do the same,"
1598760,1606600," but for the Zhiyang solution, and then we can compare two plots and see if Zhiyang's solution actually"
1606600,1613240," flattens a little bit faster. So what do you guys think? I think it's a pretty cool idea. Okay, so I'm"
1613240,1617720," going to do the following thing. I'm going to do a training. All right. And let's actually do it for 40"
1617720,1625480," solutions. I think 40 is enough, maybe even 50. Right. So we need like a pretty good amount of data to"
1625480,1633640," sort of confirm that, I think. So and then I'm going to do the output dot bin. And I'm going to redirect"
1633640,1644840," all of that to a separate file. Origin, origin time txt. There we go."
1644840,1655720," So yeah, who knows what does t mean? Does anybody use this command? It's actually a pretty useful"
1655720,1663080," command. So essentially, if you pipe your output to the t command with a file name, it will say everything"
1663080,1669800," to that file. But on top of that, it will also redirect the output to the to the standard output."
1669800,1676200," So you essentially seeing what is printed, but simultaneously the same thing is saved to the file"
1676200,1681960," as well, which is actually convenient. So you want to save the logs. But on top of that, you want to"
1681960,1689720," see them how they how they go. It's actually pretty convenient. All right, maybe while we're waiting for"
1690920,1695640," for different generations for 50 generations, maybe somebody has any questions."
1697640,1704360," I forgot that thing existed. Yeah, it's actually pretty useful thing. It's actually extremely useful thing."
1704360,1713400," T is like in canteen in continent. I don't know what that more means. Yeah, it's basically redirection,"
1713400,1718360," but it's a redirection to two places simultaneously. You redirect to file and output simultaneously."
1718360,1727080," So you sort of split the output. You're more like splitting it."
1727080,1745480," So I wonder, like Zhe Yang's approach is actually slightly different."
1745480,1753800," It's actually like a different approach to doing all of that. And I wonder if we want to like preserve the"
1753800,1759720," original approach and switch between Zhe Yang's approach and original one. I'm not sure. If Zhe Yang's approach"
1759720,1768520," is going to be way better, maybe we're going to just stick with it. I think it would make sense."
1772520,1779240," Yeah, that's basically what it means. That's actually a pretty good description, but it's a description in Haskell."
1779240,1795160," I wonder if the Haskell even has such function."
1795160,1808680," Would you look at that?"
1808680,1810840," It literally does."
1810840,1824360," It's a little bit more complex than your implementation, but I think it's pretty close."
1824360,1829720," We're almost there, by the way, we're waiting for 50 generations."
1829720,1834760," So after 50 generations, I think it's going to be OK."
1834760,1839640," Haskell is patting. Yeah."
1839640,1844120," At some point we even had like six seconds. My God."
1845480,1848840," And but we lost that generation. That was the best generations."
1848840,1851800," These were the good days of this world."
1851800,1857080," And since then, it's only degradation. It's only pure degradation."
1857080,1859240," This was the best generation of our time."
1861720,1874120," So if you want to know how 50th generation looks like, let's take a look at it."
1874120,1876360," So it's going to be output bin and this is how it looks like."
1877800,1881240," So all of them are actually bundling together."
1881240,1885480," All of them mooring, all of them doing things and stuff like that."
1889800,1892920," And they're actually dying out a little bit smoother."
1892920,1895640," Yeah."
1895640,1897560," All right."
1897560,1900120," So let's actually go to the output."
1900120,1901880," This is not what I want."
1901880,1903480," Something time."
1904280,1904840," Right."
1904840,1908920," And I think I want to like remove the generation thingy here."
1908920,1911800," Because I think it's kind of pointless."
1911800,1918360," So we're going to do query or replace rejects generation."
1918360,1921560," So a bunch of numbers."
1921560,1923400," So I suppose it's going to be zero to nine."
1923400,1927560," This dot, dot, dot."
1927560,1930120," Space."
1930120,1932680," And essentially what I want to do, I want to remove all of that shit."
1932680,1933560," There we go."
1933560,1935080," And also I want to remove as."
1935080,1936760," There we go."
1936760,1938920," So now we have the timing."
1938920,1944120," And I wonder how easy it is would be to plot that using gnuplot."
1944120,1949400," I use gnuplot quite rarely."
1949400,1955640," So every time I need to use it, I forget how to use it."
1955640,1961800," Plot CSV file or something."
1961800,1966280," So plotting using a CSV file."
1966280,1966600," All right."
1966600,1972200," So we can do."
1972200,1974520," So using."
1974520,1976600," All right."
1976600,1978600," So can I just plot it?"
1978600,1979320," So can I do gnuplot?"
1979320,1979880," Gnuplot."
1979880,1983080," It takes some time."
1983080,1983320," Okay."
1983320,1985080," So it took some time to load everything up."
1985080,1986760," And can I just plot."
1986760,1988040," What was that?"
1988040,1990680," Origin time."
1990680,1994360," Origin time CSV."
1994360,1997000," And it did a thing."
1997000,1997800," Would you look at that?"
1997800,2004840," So I suppose this is around where it converged, right?"
2004840,2009160," So this is roughly where it started to converge in terms of time."
2010680,2013320," So, but I would like to have like a different style."
2013320,2014120," Gnuplot."
2014120,2017800," Lines."
2017800,2019320," Style."
2019320,2023160," Set style line."
2023160,2023480," Okay."
2023480,2030200," Set style line."
2032200,2042840," I just want to connect them together."
2042840,2043880," That's what I want to do."
2043880,2045000," I just want to connect them together."
2045000,2049000," I should be able to do a set style line."
2050680,2052440," I don't understand."
2052440,2053800," I need an actual example."
2053800,2057320," Set style line."
2057320,2058680," 10."
2058680,2059560," Light time 1."
2059560,2061480," All right."
2061480,2062280," Can I?"
2062280,2062600," Okay."
2062600,2064600," So I think I'm going to try this thing."
2064600,2066760," Plot with lines."
2066760,2067080," Okay."
2067080,2069320," Oh, shit."
2069320,2070440," Thank you so much, Rodney."
2070440,2071960," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
2071960,2072440," All right."
2072440,2077560," Because like what's funny is that after some time, I'm going to forget how to do that."
2080680,2083400," So yeah, this is around where it converges."
2083400,2087320," So it starts here, then it starts improving, improving, and it doesn't improve anymore."
2087320,2088200," Right."
2088200,2091000," And it actually reaches its like peak."
2091000,2093480," Well, this is like a fluctuation."
2093480,2094520," So I don't consider that."
2094520,2095880," It's just, you know, an anomaly."
2095880,2099720," But yeah, it converges around like 15."
2099720,2102600," 15."
2102600,2106840," We may try to do another run of 50 generations."
2110120,2113720," Maybe less because we know roughly where it starts to converge."
2113720,2116280," Maybe we can do 25 like next time."
2116280,2120520," I just want to do a couple of runs just to confirm that."
2120520,2126200," You know, they converge around like the same amount of generations."
2126200,2127000," Right."
2127000,2130680," So this one is going to be origin"
2130680,2134520," 01 50."
2134520,2136600," Yeah."
2137400,2140040," So basically, this is this was the 50 generations."
2140040,2143400," And let's quit all of that stuff."
2143400,2145640," And let's do another training."
2145640,2148520," So this this time is going to 25."
2148520,2149560," There's going to be 25."
2149560,2153000," And this one is going to be origin"
2153000,2155240," 25 02."
2155240,2156600," CSP."
2156600,2158280," There we go."
2158280,2160840," So this time is going to be a little bit faster."
2160840,2163080," We're doing data science, boys and girls."
2163080,2165000," We're doing actual data science."
2165000,2166760," I feel so smart."
2166760,2167320," My God."
2167320,2174120," Isn't what successful people do these days?"
2174120,2177960," They do data science instead of that boomer programming."
2177960,2178440," Come on."
2178440,2180280," Who's doing programming in 2020?"
2184440,2186200," Add data science to the title."
2186200,2191400," I don't know."
2191400,2193240," I don't know how to fit it there."
2193240,2196680," Because there's only so much I can add to the title without cramming it."
2196680,2201400," So yeah, that would be pretty cool."
2201400,2202760," But no, I'm not going to add it."
2202760,2203000," Sorry."
2203000,2205000," What do you do?"
2205000,2206840," I'm doing a genetic programming."
2206840,2210280," So I would really recommend you to check out our project."
2210280,2210600," Right."
2210600,2213320," And also a playlist for previous parts that we did."
2213320,2216680," Where we did genetic programming."
2216680,2219880," So yeah, essentially."
2219880,2223160," Yeah, that's what we're doing."
2223160,2227480," You're not doing it in Rust."
2227480,2229080," So it's not really data science."
2229080,2231880," I thought you're supposed to do data science in Python."
2231880,2234120," Not really Rust."
2234120,2235080," So yeah."
2235080,2238840," I do agree that I'm not doing data science."
2238840,2240920," But this is not because I'm not doing it in Rust."
2240920,2243400," This is because I'm not doing it in Python."
2243400,2244200," Or R."
2244200,2244440," Yes."
2244440,2244760," Yes."
2244760,2245000," R."
2245000,2248680," Another data science thingy."
2248680,2255560," R stands for Rust."
2255560,2256040," Okay."
2256040,2256680," I didn't know that."
2256680,2257320," Thank you so much."
2257320,2258920," All right."
2258920,2261480," So and let's remove some..."
2261480,2263160," Let's clean up the data."
2264440,2265400," Boys and girls."
2265400,2267560," We're cleaning up the data."
2267560,2268920," So I do query replace."
2268920,2270280," Right."
2270280,2271800," And I remove these things."
2271800,2272120," Right."
2272120,2275160," And then I query replace as with nothing."
2275160,2276360," And I cleaned up the data."
2276360,2278280," I feel so fucking professional."
2278280,2279000," Oh my God."
2280280,2281560," I just cleaned up the data."
2281560,2283000," Nice."
2283000,2285080," A bunch of regular expression."
2285080,2286680," And you're a fucking data science."
2286680,2288280," My God."
2288280,2289800," I'll be fucking livable."
2289800,2290600," So plot."
2290600,2292360," Is it just..."
2292360,2293560," I forgot how to plot."
2293560,2294040," Oh fuck."
2295000,2295240," Yeah."
2295240,2296520," You just do file."
2296520,2296840," All right."
2296840,2302200," File 2502."
2302200,2303320," CSV with lines."
2303320,2306920," And it converges around 15."
2306920,2310600," Do you get Tunekeeper?"
2310600,2310920," No."
2310920,2312120," Unfortunately."
2312120,2313640," I'm not a real data scientist."
2313640,2317000," I'm actually, you know, an imposter."
2317000,2317720," Right."
2317720,2320440," So the second run also converged around 15."
2320440,2321640," So yeah."
2321640,2328920," And I think, just to be sure, I want to run another run."
2328920,2329640," So."
2329640,2332600," And then we're going to take Zhiyang's solution."
2332600,2335720," And do the same thing."
2335720,2336600," Right."
2336600,2338600," I'm going to do the same thing."
2338600,2340600," And see if it converges a little bit faster."
2340600,2344840," Sonny kind of says not going to lie, imposter."
2344840,2345080," Yeah."
2345080,2346120," Sorry."
2347720,2350040," What's up, Kolumbietko?"
2350040,2350920," Welcome to the stream."
2350920,2351480," How are you doing?"
2351480,2357880," Ploding it from zero."
2357880,2358440," I don't know."
2358440,2359160," I'm sorry."
2359160,2362520," I just gave my data to the Gnu plot and it plotted it."
2362520,2375720," Fake data scientist."
2376760,2377400," You got me."
2377400,2379880," You got me."
2379880,2381320," I'm not a real data scientist."
2381320,2388200," Can you say ""Ayaya""?"
2388200,2388760," No."
2388760,2389960," I'm not going to say ""Ayaya""."
2389960,2395560," Giving data to Gnu."
2395560,2395800," Yeah."
2395800,2397640," It's kind of dangerous to give data to Gnu."
2397640,2400120," But sometimes you have to do that."
2402120,2406280," You can plot multiple files by doing plot file with lines, second file with lines."
2406280,2407800," Oh, this is actually a pretty cool idea."
2407800,2408120," Thank you."
2408120,2411240," Will they color them slightly differently?"
2413560,2414120," Maybe not."
2414120,2414120," Maybe not."
2414120,2417000," Maybe you can also assign the colors."
2417000,2417480," Thank you."
2417480,2418440," I'm going to try that."
2418440,2419240," I'm going to try it out."
2419240,2427400," So, Gnu plot, plot, origin 25, zero."
2427400,2428520," Was it zero three?"
2429880,2430280," Okay."
2430280,2433160," So, this is a zero three and we need to clean it up."
2433160,2434680," We need to clean the data."
2434680,2435000," Right?"
2435000,2436520," We need to clean the data."
2436520,2440600," And then I'm going to click ""replace s"" with that."
2440600,2441560," And there we go."
2441560,2445960," So, 2503 csv with the lines."
2445960,2447480," All right."
2447480,2450520," And it's kind of strange."
2450520,2453160," Like, this time it didn't really start conversion properly."
2453160,2456440," Like, it went even further."
2456440,2463640," But maybe, yeah, maybe it converged like around here and the rest of this thing is anomaly."
2463640,2464920," Like, we need more data here."
2464920,2470920," But I'm going to just assume that, yeah, that's basically what is going on here."
2470920,2473240," And I like how all of them start with this thing."
2473240,2476760," They go down and only then they go up after some time."
2476760,2477960," That's actually very interesting."
2477960,2479240," Okay."
2479240,2482920," Let's actually try to render several files."
2482920,2485240," You can plot multiple files by doing plot with file."
2485240,2485560," Okay."
2485560,2486440," I have to put comma."
2486440,2487720," All right."
2487720,2491320," So, I'm going to start with 50."
2493880,2500680," 50.01, then origin 25.02 with lines."
2500680,2505640," Origin 25.03 csv with lines."
2505640,2506840," All right."
2506840,2508840," Oh, it even colors them differently."
2508840,2509000," Okay."
2509000,2509720," Would you look at that?"
2509720,2512680," So, there were three runs."
2512680,2517560," And yeah, overall, they usually converge like around like this range."
2517560,2519640," Like 15.20."
2519640,2522920," And yeah, it actually makes sense."
2523880,2525000," It actually makes sense."
2525000,2526040," Cool."
2526040,2530840," Happy Friday the 13th."
2530840,2531080," Yeah."
2531080,2537800," Happy Friday the 13th indeed."
2537800,2539400," All right."
2539400,2541000," So, that was actually pretty cool."
2541000,2542360," That was actually pretty educational."
2543400,2547160," so, I think we need to do more plots in the future."
2547160,2548120," Here, Hudson plots."
2548120,2549800," Sorry."
2549800,2556200," And let's actually switch to Jiang's solution and see how fast his solution converges."
2557640,2557960," Okay."
2557960,2568920," Actually, epic data science."
2568920,2569720," Yes, exactly."
2573800,2578120," and add remote name Jiang."
2578120,2580920," Okay."
2580920,2581320," All right."
2581320,2583560," So, and we're fetching his solutions."
2583560,2586120," Better genes."
2586120,2588360," Nice one."
2588360,2589080," Thank you so much."
2589080,2591400," Better genes indeed."
2592520,2595320," So, let's actually try to below that."
2595320,2600840," And I want to run the simulation just in case."
2600840,2602040," So, here's the simulation."
2602040,2604360," All right."
2604360,2606040," So, this is actually pretty cool."
2607400,2611240," And in the first generation, they're already doing something interesting."
2611240,2612040," Would you look at that?"
2612040,2620040," To be fair, Jiang's solution already produces better first generation than mine."
2620040,2623080," So, that's actually kind of cool."
2623080,2624920," So, this is just the first generation."
2624920,2625480," All right."
2625480,2629240," So, let's take a look at the 10th generation."
2629240,2629560," Right."
2629560,2631720," Just how a 10th generation behaves."
2631720,2633880," So, we're going to do train."
2635240,2637880," 10 output bin."
2637880,2640200," We're not going to collect any time in data yet."
2640200,2643960," Just the."
2643960,2651560," Interesting."
2651560,2655480," All right."
2655480,2656680," So, the 10th generation."
2656680,2661960," So, simulate output bin."
2661960,2663480," So, this is the 10th generation."
2664200,2665240," And they all are moving."
2665240,2666440," They're all doing things."
2666440,2668520," Which is cool."
2668520,2675000," All right."
2675000,2679560," So."
2679560,2682120," Oh."
2682120,2685880," You actually clicked that."
2685880,2686280," Thank you."
2686280,2687000," Thank you so much."
2687000,2688040," Send that to here."
2688040,2688680," Hudson plots."
2688680,2691640," All right."
2692840,2697240," So, I think we're ready to do the actual data science now."
2697240,2698760," How about that?"
2698760,2701080," I kind of like the Jiang solution."
2701080,2707160," I think like trying to generate all of the possible combinations of states and environments."
2707160,2708280," It's a pretty cool idea."
2708280,2713560," Because it makes them less likely to stuck doing nothing."
2713560,2713880," Right."
2713880,2718600," Because they cover all of the possible situations and combinations."
2718600,2719480," So, I think it's pretty good."
2720040,2720360," All right."
2720360,2721960," So, we're going to start with maybe."
2721960,2725400," Let's actually go with 50."
2725400,2727000," Just in case."
2727000,2728600," Just to see how it goes."
2728600,2729640," And we're going to do tea."
2729640,2731720," Zhiyang."
2731720,2733240," 50."
2733240,2733960," 01."
2733960,2734920," CS3."
2734920,2735480," There we go."
2735480,2736920," And."
2736920,2737640," Not tea."
2737640,2738360," Oh my god."
2738360,2739400," Why am I so."
2739400,2740920," I think I just need a cup of tea."
2740920,2752520," That's probably why."
2752520,2753000," Alias."
2753000,2753400," TT."
2753400,2753800," Yeah."
2753800,2756920," Now."
2756920,2757160," Well."
2757160,2757400," I mean."
2757400,2759720," I have to stop the training to do the alias."
2759720,2761240," So, I cannot do that right now."
2761240,2761560," Sorry."
2762200,2764680," I can do that in a different terminal."
2764680,2765560," Sure."
2765560,2766040," Alias."
2766040,2768360," Alias."
2768360,2769480," TT."
2769480,2770520," But."
2770520,2772360," It's not going to be available in that terminal."
2772360,2773960," Where I'm currently running this thing."
2773960,2774280," And."
2774280,2775240," Yeah."
2775240,2776040," I have to kill it."
2776040,2778120," Control Z."
2778120,2779560," Wait."
2779560,2781000," Will Control Z actually work?"
2781000,2782120," But."
2782120,2784040," I'm not sure if it's going to affect the results."
2784040,2785480," So."
2785480,2786200," I'm."
2786200,2786760," I'm not sure."
2786760,2787240," I'm sorry."
2787240,2791160," Zhang's solution sucks."
2791160,2792200," I don't know."
2792200,2793960," Maybe he optimized the code."
2793960,2794200," And."
2794200,2797720," Not even two seconds."
2797720,2807160," It doesn't even reach the two seconds."
2807160,2807560," But."
2807560,2809800," He didn't change the simulation code."
2809800,2812920," He didn't really change the simulation code."
2815320,2827400," Maybe it reduced the number of calculations."
2827400,2831560," We're only timing the simulation actually."
2831560,2833960," So."
2833960,2835880," If you take a look at how we do that."
2835880,2837480," Trainer."
2837480,2841560," So."
2841560,2843240," The only thing we're timing here."
2843240,2843880," Is."
2843880,2845080," Stepping through."
2845080,2845960," The game."
2845960,2847080," We're not timing."
2847080,2847560," Timing."
2847560,2848840," Making next generation."
2848840,2851400," Uh."
2851400,2852040," We're not timing."
2852040,2853000," Next generation."
2853000,2857320," Okay."
2857320,2857880," So."
2857880,2858280," Um."
2858280,2859480," Let me see."
2859480,2863080," Not the absolute times."
2863080,2863960," This is why we'll."
2863960,2864600," Need to make."
2864600,2864840," Like."
2864840,2865320," Several."
2866360,2866840," Several."
2866840,2868200," Runs."
2868200,2870840," Boom."
2870840,2875080," Okay."
2875080,2876040," So."
2876040,2876760," Gnu plot."
2876760,2879720," Plot."
2879720,2882200," Zhiyang."
2882200,2883400," 50."
2883400,2883720," Zero."
2883720,2884040," One."
2884040,2884840," CSV."
2884840,2885720," With the lines."
2885720,2887000," All right."
2887000,2889560," That's kind of interesting."
2889560,2891480," This is 50 generations by the way."
2891480,2893640," This is 50 generations."
2893640,2897000," Huh."
2897000,2902760," So."
2902760,2905160," And it starts to degrade over time."
2905160,2908120," Huh."
2908120,2910120," All right."
2910120,2911960," Let's actually do a couple of more runs."
2911960,2912520," Uh."
2912520,2915640," So."
2915640,2916360," Maybe this time."
2916360,2917480," I'm going to have less."
2917480,2917800," So."
2917800,2918840," It takes less time."
2918840,2919000," So."
2919000,2920680," This one is going to be 30.02."
2925560,2926840," It does have some."
2926840,2927560," Same deep."
2927560,2927960," At the."
2927960,2928360," Five."
2928360,2928920," Five."
2928920,2929640," Generations."
2929640,2929960," Yeah."
2929960,2949640," It's kind of hard to know."
2949640,2951000," Like."
2951000,2952680," I think we'll need more parameters."
2954600,2954840," Uh."
2954840,2958360," Maybe plot both Euros and GX results."
2958360,2959240," And see the difference."
2959240,2959480," Yeah."
2959480,2959640," Yeah."
2959640,2960600," I'm going to do that."
2960600,2963240," After I did three Zhiyang's runs."
2963240,2964120," So."
2964120,2965560," This is definitely what I'm going to do."
2965560,2971720," I think time is not really reliable."
2971720,2972040," Um."
2972040,2974360," Is not really reliable."
2974360,2977560," How to say that."
2977560,2980920," Reliable measure of quality."
2980920,2982680," Of the generation."
2984280,2985320," We need more things."
2985320,2987160," Like how many things they ate."
2987160,2988440," And how many attacks."
2988440,2989160," They performed."
2989160,2990360," And stuff like that."
2990360,2990520," So."
2990520,2991320," This is something."
2991320,2992760," Uh."
2992760,2994040," Something that we'll have to implement."
2994040,2995000," At some point."
2995000,2995560," All right."
2995560,2996120," So."
2996120,2996760," Uh."
2996760,2997480," Gnu plot."
2998920,2999240," So."
2999240,2999720," So plot."
2999720,3000520," Uh."
3000520,3003000," Zhiyang."
3003000,3004760," Thirty."
3004760,3007320," Zero two csv with lines."
3007320,3008200," Oh."
3008200,3008520," I."
3008520,3008840," Of course."
3008840,3009880," I forgot to clean it up."
3009880,3011080," Of course."
3011080,3012680," I forgot to clean up the data."
3012680,3014360," As an epic data engineer."
3014360,3014920," Um."
3014920,3016360," Okay."
3016360,3017400," So I'm going to remove that."
3017400,3020360," Uh huh."
3020360,3024840," I don't know why I quit Gnu plot."
3024840,3026120," I think it was absolutely dumb."
3026120,3026920," But."
3026920,3030760," Interesting."
3030760,3032600," That was."
3032600,3034120," It's kind of strange."
3034120,3034760," Like it."
3034760,3036040," Stagnated at this point."
3036040,3036760," And then."
3036760,3037480," It jumped."
3037480,3039240," Like there was some sort of."
3039240,3039960," Like a."
3039960,3040600," Revolution."
3040600,3042920," So some sort of combination of genes."
3042920,3043960," Was found."
3043960,3045240," And it carried along."
3045240,3046600," And stuff like that."
3046600,3047400," So."
3047400,3049000," That was interesting."
3049000,3051720," All right."
3051720,3052600," So."
3052600,3053720," And let's do the last one."
3053720,3055320," You should probably have distribution graph."
3055320,3057480," For how long all of them survived."
3057480,3058280," Yes."
3058280,3059320," That's exactly what I said."
3059320,3060200," By the way."
3060200,3060600," But."
3060600,3062440," It's not as easy to implement."
3062440,3063880," As just run this thing."
3063880,3064600," And."
3064600,3065960," Plot time with the Gnu plot."
3065960,3066520," Because that means."
3066520,3067560," I have to go to the code."
3067560,3069800," Make some modifications."
3069800,3071880," Prepare the entire."
3071880,3072520," Like pipeline."
3072520,3073480," And stuff like that."
3073480,3074680," What I want to do right now."
3074680,3075480," I want to quickly."
3075480,3076200," Just check."
3076200,3077240," And compare."
3077240,3077800," Somehow."
3077800,3078760," All right."
3078760,3079720," So."
3079720,3080520," I do realize."
3080520,3081560," That I need to do."
3081560,3082600," Like a better job."
3082600,3084040," At comparing these two solutions."
3084040,3084600," But right now."
3084600,3086040," I just don't have enough tools."
3086040,3087400," To do that."
3087400,3087960," So."
3087960,3089240," I really apologize for that."
3089240,3089960," So."
3089960,3091320," I just want to quickly compare."
3091320,3091960," And just see."
3091960,3092360," What's."
3092360,3092840," What's."
3092840,3093400," The difference."
3093640,3108760," Modifying codes for developers."
3108760,3109640," Were data scientists."
3109640,3110040," Exactly."
3110040,3127960," You have to write a paper in latif."
3127960,3129240," To be true data scientist."
3129240,3129640," Studying."
3129640,3131160," I actually did write in latif."
3131160,3133480," My final thesis at uni."
3133480,3135160," So."
3135160,3135560," Am I."
3135560,3136840," A scientist now?"
3136840,3138680," Probably."
3138680,3139640," I don't know."
3139640,3141080," So."
3141080,3141800," GNU plot."
3142840,3143160," And."
3143160,3144120," And we're going to do."
3144120,3144680," Plot."
3144680,3146040," Zhe."
3146040,3146440," Yang."
3146440,3149320," 30."

3150200,3151080," CSV."
3151080,3151880," With lines."
3151880,3152680," Right."
3152680,3153560," And."
3153560,3155400," I forgot to clean it up yet again."
3155400,3156760," 0."
3156760,3157160," 3."
3157160,3158520," Replace."
3158520,3159160," This thing."
3159160,3160280," We ruin it."
3160280,3161080," We replace."
3161080,3161440," S."
3161440,3161880," Nothing."
3161880,3162680," There we go."
3162680,3163660," One more time."
3163660,3164860," And there you go."
3164860,3165500," So."
3165500,3166140," Actually."
3166140,3167180," Yang's a little bit."
3167180,3169420," More inconsistent."
3169420,3171340," Than mine."
3171340,3173100," But that's okay."
3173100,3173900," Okay."
3173900,3174700," Let's actually compare."
3174700,3175900," All of the Yang's solution."
3175900,3176380," Right."
3176380,3177020," There's going to be."
3177020,3177420," One."
3177420,3178540," Then."
3178540,3178700," Uh."
3178700,3180060," Zhiyang."
3180060,3181100," 30."
3181100,3181580," Zero."
3181580,3181980," Two."
3181980,3182780," CSV."
3182780,3183900," With lines."
3183900,3184940," And."
3184940,3185500," Uh."
3185500,3186220," Zhiyang."
3186220,3186780," 30."
3186780,3187180," Zero."
3187180,3187580," Three."
3187580,3188780," CSV."
3188780,3189420," With lines."
3189420,3191240," Maybe just write a simple shell script."
3191240,3192080," To clean the data."
3192080,3192780," Uh."
3192780,3194100," I actually already did."
3194100,3194820," All of the runs."
3195500,3196140," Of Zhiyang."
3196140,3196320," So."
3196320,3199340," Um."
3199340,3203200," So."
3203200,3204440," This is all of the runs."
3204440,3205140," Of Zhiyang."
3205140,3210060," Um."
3210060,3211840," And it's actually."
3211840,3213940," Behaves pretty much the same."
3213940,3215260," Like a round of 50."
3215260,3216500," 15 generations."
3216500,3218540," I didn't think it actually."
3218540,3219340," Improves anything."
3219340,3220700," So."
3220700,3221120," Just."
3221120,3222600," Yeah."
3222600,3225180," Uh."
3225500,3225940," Um."
3225940,3227320," All right."
3227320,3227780," I think."
3227780,3229540," It converges at the same rate."
3229540,3231420," Is that what I'm trying to say here."
3231420,3233080," It just converges at the same rate."
3233080,3234480," Uh."
3234480,3235080," But now."
3235080,3236040," We can compare."
3236040,3236740," Uh."
3236740,3237360," We can compare."
3237360,3238360," First."
3238360,3239140," Zhiyang's."
3239140,3239580," Uh."
3239580,3239940," Uh."
3239940,3240020," Uh."
3240020,3240620," Uh."
3240620,3240840," Like."
3240840,3241220," Run."
3241220,3242600," And the original."
3242600,3243100," Uh."
3243100,3243440," Run."
3243440,3245520," Uh."
3245520,3246440," Zero."
3246440,3246680," One."
3246680,3247240," CSV."
3247240,3248440," With lines."
3250600,3251000," So."
3251000,3255860," This is original."
3255860,3257540," This is original."
3257540,3259660," And this is Zhiyang's."
3259660,3261000," But this is actually time."
3261000,3262980," This is actually time."
3262980,3264960," And what does time."
3264960,3266300," Tell us about."
3266300,3269160," What does time tell us about."
3269160,3271740," We're timing."
3271740,3273280," Only simulation."
3273280,3274880," We're timing."
3274880,3275640," Only simulation."
3275820,3276360," We don't time."
3276360,3278000," Generating new generation."
3278000,3278920," And stuff like that."
3278920,3280240," We're just timing that."
3280240,3281100," And the question is."
3281100,3282440," Did Zhiyang."
3282440,3283160," Uh."
3283160,3283980," Imp."
3283980,3284300," Uh."
3284300,3284540," Like."
3284540,3285060," Um."
3285060,3286460," Modify."
3286460,3287580," Simulation."
3287580,3289000," He modified git ignore."
3289000,3290660," He modified the game."
3290660,3291780," Uh."
3291780,3292460," Within the game."
3292460,3293760," It's generate new genes."
3293760,3295100," Right."
3295100,3297180," Mate agents."
3297180,3298540," Is not related to simulations."
3298540,3299440," Mutate agents."
3299440,3300700," Is not related to simulation."
3300700,3302020," Um."
3302020,3304520," He did not."
3304520,3305340," Modify."
3305560,3306040," Anything."
3306040,3306960," Uh."
3306960,3308500," Related to simulation."
3308500,3309080," So."
3309080,3309860," That means."
3309860,3310860," Um."
3310860,3311820," The times."
3311820,3313340," Between my solution."
3313340,3314240," And Zhiyang's solutions."
3314240,3315080," Are comparable."
3315080,3315840," Because with time."
3315840,3316600," Only simulation."
3316600,3317680," So."
3317680,3318400," Yeah."
3318400,3322340," Aren't steps more reliable than time."
3322340,3323080," They are."
3323080,3323620," But that means."
3323620,3324980," I will have to start over again."
3324980,3326480," Um."
3326480,3328540," Okay."
3328540,3329200," Let's actually."
3329200,3330100," Count the steps."
3330100,3330760," I think it will be."
3330760,3331680," A little bit more fair."
3331680,3332940," I think it would be."
3332940,3333700," A little bit more fair."
3333700,3335060," Um."
3335300,3342180," All right."
3342180,3343020," Um."
3343020,3344000," More data science."
3344000,3344360," Yes."
3344360,3345400," Um."
3345400,3347240," So."
3347240,3347860," Uh."
3347860,3348740," We're gonna have data."
3348740,3350220," So."
3350220,3351140," This is a time."
3351140,3351720," Right."
3351780,3353640," So I'm gonna save all of this data."
3353640,3355080," Here."
3355080,3356960," Uh."
3356960,3358740," And we're gonna actually compare them."
3358740,3359340," Uh."
3359340,3359920," By."
3359920,3360860," Uh."
3360860,3361560," Amount of steps."
3361560,3363400," I think generally it's a little bit better."
3363400,3366000," Uh."
3366000,3368080," We're gonna compare them by amount of steps."
3368080,3368800," Um."
3368800,3371440," So we'll have to go to the trainer."
3371440,3372860," To the trainer."
3372860,3375800," And how do we even count amount of steps."
3377080,3377520," Uh."
3377520,3378040," All right."
3378040,3378080," All right."
3378080,3380080," Um."
3380080,3382280," So this is how we're gonna do that."
3382280,3382960," Flash."
3382960,3385340," Um."
3385340,3388560," His programming cuts his paycheck immediately."
3388560,3389620," Actually programming."
3389620,3390120," Yeah."
3390120,3390300," Yeah."
3390300,3390420," Yeah."
3390420,3392740," So I'm not supposed to program."
3392740,3394600," I'm supposed to do data science."
3395280,3396200," Um."
3396200,3398160," Steps."
3398160,3400700," Mm-hmm."
3400700,3403360," Um."
3403360,3405900," Steps plus one."
3405900,3407200," I mean."
3407200,3409400," I might have actually just used while."
3409400,3409980," Why am I."
3409980,3410260," Like."
3410260,3412560," What's the difference between for loop and while loop?"
3412560,3413940," It's the same shit anyway."
3413940,3416320," It's just a syntax sugar."
3416320,3417640," Uh."
3417640,3418320," All right."
3418320,3418760," So."
3418760,3419240," And then."
3419240,3421660," We can just print the amount of steps."
3421660,3422780," We've got here."
3422780,3424160," Uh."
3424160,3424400," Yep."
3424920,3429780," And that's the patch that we want to apply."
3429780,3432460," For loops are bloat."
3432460,3432820," Yeah."
3432820,3433900," That's true."
3433900,3435940," Uh."
3435940,3436840," Two."
3436840,3437200," Two."
3437200,3437260," Two."
3437260,3437560," Two."
3437560,3440740," So."
3440740,3441340," Where am I?"
3441340,3442400," Am I on the original solution?"
3442400,3442780," Yes."
3442780,3443220," I am."
3443220,3445100," So here's the patch."
3445100,3447060," I probably want to save it at some point."
3447060,3448500," Um."
3448500,3450700," Mm-hmm."
3450700,3454100," So let me rebuild everything."
3454560,3457780," And if I try to train."
3457780,3459280," GP train."
3459280,3461500," 10 generations."
3461500,3462860," Output bin."
3462860,3466620," Wait a second."
3466620,3467240," It didn't."
3467240,3468460," Uh."
3468460,3469240," It didn't work."
3469240,3471740," Because I'm supposed to not print that."
3471740,3472720," Uh."
3472720,3473020," Yes."
3473020,3474520," I'm supposed to not print that."
3474520,3475020," Right."
3475080,3476100," I want to print only numbers."
3476100,3478120," So it's a little bit easier to plot later."
3478120,3478620," Yes."
3478620,3479420," That's quite important."
3479420,3480940," Uh."
3480940,3481960," That is quite important."
3481960,3485640," So let me take a look."
3488140,3488580," Um."
3488580,3488640," Um."
3488640,3492040," Um."
3492040,3504540," Um."
3504540,3505040," Um."
3505040,3505480," Okay."
3505480,3506560," So that's actually pretty cool."
3511980,3512580," Nicer."
3512580,3513220," Uh."
3513220,3514340," Fairness."
3514340,3515020," So yeah."
3515020,3516000," Now we have in fairness."
3516000,3517040," But unfortunately."
3517040,3518520," It would be kind of cool."
3518520,3518960," To."
3518960,3520260," Actually."
3520260,3522100," You know."
3522100,3522740," Show."
3524300,3525580," Like some information."
3525580,3526540," For."
3526540,3527300," For."
3527300,3527880," For the viewers."
3527880,3528280," Because."
3528280,3528660," Uh."
3528660,3529720," When I'm gonna sit here."
3529720,3531000," Waiting for these numbers."
3531000,3532200," It's not clear for the viewers."
3532200,3533120," What the fuck is going on."
3533120,3535000," So we have a pretty cool idea chat."
3535000,3536540," So I'm gonna do the following thing."
3536540,3536960," I'm gonna."
3536960,3538240," Do it like that."
3538240,3539440," STD error."
3539440,3540920," Generating this thing."
3540920,3541700," And I'm gonna flash."
3541700,3542640," STD error."
3542640,3543540," Like this."
3543540,3544620," Uh."
3544620,3545700," Then I print."
3545700,3546900," The amount of steps."
3546900,3548080," Uh."
3548080,3548800," Like this."
3548800,3550500," Yeah."
3550500,3554200," Uh."
3554300,3555160," The longer programs."
3555160,3556540," The more content sorting has."
3556540,3556840," Well."
3556840,3557100," I mean."
3557100,3557920," Content is something."
3557920,3558760," People want to watch."
3558760,3559020," If."
3559020,3559360," Uh."
3559360,3560260," There's nothing to watch."
3560260,3561260," People not gonna watch that."
3561260,3562380," So it's not really a content."
3562380,3563780," Uh."
3563780,3564740," Right."
3564740,3568940," Save to the file."
3568940,3570520," Both time and steps."
3570520,3571600," Uh."
3571600,3575440," I'm trying to minimize."
3575440,3576920," Myself work."
3576920,3577620," You're suggesting."
3577620,3579260," For me to do more work."
3579260,3580300," For cleaning up the data."
3580300,3581480," I don't know why you're doing that."
3581480,3582300," Maybe you hate me."
3582300,3583420," Uh."
3583420,3584060," But yeah."
3584300,3585060," So essentially."
3585060,3586400," If I do something like T."
3586400,3587280," Um."
3587280,3589180," Origin 10."
3589180,3590300," Uh."
3590300,3590620," Zero."
3590620,3590840," One."
3590840,3591380," CSB."
3591380,3592220," Uh."
3592220,3592560," Right."
3592560,3595680," Okay."
3595680,3596600," This shit didn't work."
3596600,3597840," So that means I'll have to."
3597840,3599800," Um."
3599800,3602800," I have to do it like that."
3602800,3604840," All right."
3604840,3605200," Whatever."
3605200,3605780," So."
3605780,3606540," Um."
3606540,3608200," Let's actually start it like this."
3608200,3610020," So we're gonna have 30 generations."
3610020,3610960," This is 30."
3611360,3611760," And."
3611760,3612460," Um."
3612460,3614280," Yeah."
3614280,3614840," There we go."
3614840,3617900," We'll have to do it."
3617900,3618340," Uh."
3618340,3619200," Do it three times."
3619200,3624180," Uh."
3624180,3627420," Excuse me."
3635420,3647100," What."
3647100,3647920," What did I do?"
3647920,3649160," I just do."
3649160,3649960," Print F."
3649960,3651680," LD steps."
3651680,3654320," I don't see any steps now."
3654320,3656960," You removed the flash."
3658100,3658560," Well."
3658560,3659040," Cool."
3659040,3663360," But it has a new line."
3663360,3664760," It has a new line."
3664760,3667480," New line usually triggers flash."
3667480,3669960," So."
3669960,3672960," Yeah."
3672960,3673420," Exactly."
3673420,3674160," So it's weird."
3674160,3680280," We don't print generation."
3680280,3681180," What are you guys talking about?"
3681180,3681620," Oh my god."
3683620,3696140," I'm going to start over."
3696140,3696160," I'm going to start over."
3696160,3701080," Mm-hmm."
3713080,3715640," I don't know what I did."
3715640,3717680," But I'm just starting over."
3717680,3719780," You probably noticed."
3719780,3722360," Noticed my fault."
3722360,3723240," But I cannot see it."
3723240,3725040," I literally cannot see it."
3725040,3726980," Uh."
3742540,3761520," Flush doesn't help."
3761520,3762300," By the way."
3772160,3776060," It's something super stupid."
3776060,3782340," I fucking hate software development."
3782340,3788320," Okay."
3788320,3791680," If I T it now to origin 30."
3791680,3793940," Zero one CSV."
3793940,3799120," What did I fucking do?"
3799120,3800900," It didn't work with flash."
3800900,3802620," It didn't work without flash."
3802620,3805320," And now it's all of a sudden fucking working."
3805320,3805840," Whoa."
3805840,3811040," All right."
3811040,3812340," Okay."
3812340,3814540," Let's just start it."
3814540,3815420," Let's just start it."
3815420,3819080," Okay."
3819080,3820500," First round."
3820500,3821940," Original solution."
3821940,3822960," First round."
3822960,3823000," First round."
3826960,3836240," Is it even improving?"
3836240,3836240," Is it even improving?"
3836240,3838680," Are you improving, son?"
3838680,3840420," It is improving."
3840420,3842740," So as you can see, there's more steps over time."
3845740,3855020," I'm going to be an artist."
3855020,3855600," I'm going to be an artist."
3855600,3855920," Yeah."
3855920,3860120," God damn software development."
3860120,3867960," I'm going to be an artist."
3867960,3867960," I'm going to be an artist."
3867960,3867960," I'm going to be an artist."
3867960,3868660," I'm going to be an artist."
3868660,3869220," I'm going to be an artist."
3869220,3869920," I'm going to be an artist."
3869920,3870620," I'm going to be an artist."
3870620,3870960," I'm going to be an artist."
3870960,3878360," It didn't even improve that much."
3878360,3879460," Like it just."
3879460,3881600," The original was 26."
3881600,3883320," And we improved it."
3883320,3886540," Like we added like additional six steps."
3886540,3888560," Essentially."
3888560,3894760," Four to six steps."
3894760,3897800," But it's around 30 anyway."
3897800,3899600," It's actually around 30."
3900240,3900820," Van."
3900820,3903620," My name is Van."
3903620,3905000," And I'm an artist."
3905000,3909820," Performance artist."
3909820,3913580," I measure performance of my applications."
3913580,3917800," That's why they call me a performance artist."
3917800,3918280," I'm here, right?"
3918280,3919940," It's funny."
3919940,3920660," Funny joke."
3920660,3922360," The stages of development."
3922360,3923140," Nothing works."
3923140,3923800," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
3923800,3924180," Classic."
3929520,3934320," All righty."
3934320,3935540," So, second run."
3935540,3938340," We're not going to plot it yet."
3938340,3938780," Right?"
3938780,3941040," We're not going to have it and plot it yet."
3941040,3946980," I hate myself for unironically laughing at this."
3946980,3947840," Oh, yeah."
3947840,3954240," You mean the performance artist joke?"
3954900,3955900," Oh, I see."
3955900,3960620," Oh, by the way."
3960620,3963340," Van this day is streaming on Twitch as far as I know."
3963340,3964160," Yeah."
3964160,3965680," He's a Twitch streamer now."
3968020,3968800," It's pretty cool."
3968800,3974960," I don't really know what he's doing on Twitch."
3974960,3983120," I mean, considering his background, there's not that much of his experience he can apply here."
3984240,3985340," But he's doing something."
3985340,3991920," Progress is not that good."
3991920,3995100," Just six steps longer than initial values on first step."
3995100,3995920," Thank you so much."
3995920,3996700," I didn't notice."
3996700,3997700," Thank you, Tabco Wild."
3997700,3999760," It is, in fact, very sad."
4001260,4004800," I wish I didn't know that, but since you told me, now I'm sad."
4004800,4006360," Why did you tell me that?"
4006360,4008600," Why did you tell me?"
4008600,4010440," Now I'm sad."
4010440,4013240," You know that I cannot read numbers."
4027060,4029380," We're gonna improve it today, old man, okay?"
4029380,4030420," We're gonna improve it."
4030420,4034640," I have a couple of ideas on how to make it faster."
4034640,4042140," I mean, to be fair, since we're not relying on time anymore, we could've actually enabled optimization."
4042140,4046540," Yeah, I suppose."
4046540,4047740," We could've."
4047740,4048340," Could've done."
4048340,4051460," If only I had mesh shaders, exactly."
4051460,4052640," Oh, right."
4052640,4053320," The third one."
4053320,4054060," Oh, yeah."
4054060,4055060," Oh, yeah."
4055060,4056060," Oh, yeah."
4056060,4063280," I'm on Big Sur now."
4063280,4065500," MacOS dance game."
4065500,4079600," Hello, AliFoxRivals."
4079600,4080680," Welcome to the stream."
4085060,4087820," Maybe other solution runs faster because less genes."
4087820,4089180," Maybe."
4089180,4095260," Again, the same number of steps."
4095260,4096760," Am I that pepega?"
4096760,4101160," Well, the same number of steps is expected."
4101160,4103220," So, I don't know what you expected."
4103220,4106280," But that's..."
4106280,4108680," Like, I see what pretty much I expected, personally."
4109080,4110320," I have no idea what you expected."
4110320,4110900," I'm sorry."
4110900,4132540," Always even number of steps."
4132700,4133660," Yeah, it's kind of sus."
4133660,4133660," Yeah, it's kind of sus."
4133660,4143760," Jiang reduced number of genes from 142 to 28."
4143760,4144980," Mm-hmm."
4144980,4146380," Interesting."
4146380,4150880," All right."
4158560,4159680," We're almost there, by the way."
4159680,4159720," We're almost there, by the way."
4159720,4160840," We're almost there."
4160840,4169180," All right."
4169180,4171420," So, we collected the initial data."
4171420,4173480," And I'm going to go to GNU plot."
4173480,4175360," Plot"
4175360,4195180," Let's see how it's going to go."
4195180,4197080," Oh!"
4197080,4198800," That's what you were talking about."
4203800,4207080," Yeah, I couldn't understand what you're trying to tell me, but, yeah."
4207080,4212620," Oh!"
4212620,4213800," Yeah."
4213800,4215160," That's really strange."
4215160,4216020," What the fuck?"
4216020,4231900," That is really sus."
4231900,4233240," I'm not going to lie."
4233800,4235260," I'm not going to lie."
4235260,4236160," Uh, okay."
4236160,4243720," Because I know for sure that I update the seed."
4243720,4244620," Right."
4244620,4245640," If I go to..."
4245640,4247000," Ah!"
4247000,4251040," It explains everything."
4251040,4251980," Look at that."
4251980,4257200," We're just using the same seed."
4257200,4259480," There's no point in even trying..."
4259480,4259960," Oh my god."
4259960,4259960," Oh my god."
4259960,4260720," I'm so dumb."
4260720,4264220," It's using the same seed."
4264220,4264780," For..."
4268780,4278000," Another three rounds, boys and girls."
4278000,4279840," Another three rounds."
4279840,4281180," Are you ready?"
4281180,4287120," Are you ready for another three rounds?"
4287120,4288260," I'm fucking ready."
4288260,4289900," I'm fucking ready, mate."
4291760,4292140," Uh..."
4292140,4292500," Okay."
4292500,4294300," So..."
4294300,4294940," Uh..."
4294940,4296720," Let's run it."
4296720,4302060," Please O2."
4302060,4302580," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
4302580,4303400," I think it's a good idea."
4303400,4305360," Maybe even O3."
4305360,4310300," Because since we don't rely on time anymore, we can actually optimize it a little bit better."
4313220,4313720," Um..."
4313720,4313720," Um..."
4313720,4314220," Um..."
4314220,4318220," Um..."
4318220,4318900," Okay."
4318900,4318900," Okay."
4318900,4340100," Mm-hmm."
4340100,4342540," Is it faster though?"
4342540,4344080," I think it's a little bit faster."
4344080,4348060," That speed though."
4348060,4348700," Exactly."
4348700,4351020," Super fast."
4351020,4352440," Super fast."
4372540,4380080," Let's see."
4380080,4381000," Yes, it is C."
4381000,4382080," We're doing..."
4382080,4382080," We're doing..."
4382080,4412060," Thank you."
4412080,4422840," Refresh your page, refresh your page, refresh your page, refresh your page, refresh your page, refresh your page."
4422840,4425520," Hello, welcome back."
4425520,4428780," I have no idea what happened, but something horrible happened."
4428780,4430600," My internet just went down."
4430600,4431900," I'm really sorry about that."
4431900,4433840," Yeah."
4433840,4438880," So, but at least I was doing runs while I was offline."
4441760,4443120," Welcome, welcome back."
4443120,4447900," So, yep."
4447900,4460500," So, the last run."
4460500,4461820," So, we're going to have three runs."
4462480,4467620," And then we're going to just see how it goes."
4467620,4471380," I refreshed and got an ad."
4471380,4473080," That was intentional."
4473080,4479980," So, you thought I told you to refresh the page so you will reduce the delay?"
4480440,4482540," No, I was just wanting you to get an ad."
4484540,4487160," Alright."
4487160,4494420," So, origin 30.01 CSV with lines."
4494420,4496560," Lines."
4496560,4502000," Origin 30.02 CSV with lines."
4502000,4507880," And origin 30.03 CSV with lines."
4507880,4509960," All right."
4509960,4514400," So, so, yeah."
4514400,4515380," They converge."
4515380,4520640," They actually converge around, like, six, seven generations."
4520640,4526180," That's the, that's around the place they converge, I would say."
4527300,4530100," So, at some point we, we even had 38 of them."
4530100,4530780," But, yeah."
4530780,4532940," Anyway."
4532940,4534920," So, we have a pretty useful patch."
4534920,4539220," We have a pretty useful patch that we want to apply to Xiang's solution as well."
4539220,4539980," Right."
4539980,4541440," So, I'm going to go ahead and stash it."
4541440,4543800," And switch to Xiang's solution."
4543800,4546260," And I'm going to unstash that."
4546260,4547260," Right."
4548880,4550260," So, it was unstashed."
4550260,4552640," So, it was also going to be applied to Xiang's solution."
4552640,4554240," And we're going to rebuild everything."
4554240,4557900," All right."
4557900,4564540," So, let's start."
4564540,4566080," So, Xiang."
4566080,4575660," Maybe average out the data."
4575660,4577280," I don't know."
4577280,4577680," Maybe."
4578880,4585860," I see where you got your name."
4585860,4586800," Check out the FAQ."
4586800,4593980," Check out the project comments."
4593980,4604780," Well, what can I say?"
4608780,4618280," It's evolving just backwards."
4618280,4619960," Yeah."
4619960,4627500," So, this is the second run."
4627500,4631240," It actually goes, like, becomes worse over time."
4631240,4632440," It doesn't stabilize."
4634960,4640300," It does not stabilize, unfortunately."
4640300,4640440," It does not stabilize, unfortunately."
4662840,4664100," It will be also pretty good if..."
4664100,4665180," It will be also pretty good if..."
4665180,4668180," It will be also pretty good if..."
4668180,4670320," The amount of steps in the simulation."
4670320,4672660," Until everyone is dead."
4672660,4674660," It will be also pretty good if..."
4674660,4675760," The amount of steps in the simulation."
4675760,4676600," Until everyone is dead."
4676600,4677860," So, let's do..."
4677860,4678140," All right."
4678140,4679780," So, let's do..."
4679780,4680360," I'm going to plot now."
4680360,4682560," Plot."
4682560,4684940," Zhe Yang 30..."
4684940,4688200," 30.01 CSV with lines."
4688200,4695200," Zhe Yang 30.02 CSV with lines."
4695200,4699260," Zhe Yang 30.02 CSV with lines."
4699260,4725180," 30.03 csv with lines all right oh no no no no no no no all right so that is interesting"
4725900,4734860," um so let's actually compare uh my original solution right origin 30.01 csv with the giants one"
4734860,4743020," uh with the giants one uh all right so uh okay so"
4743020,4748540," the purple one is my original this is the giants one"
4752540,4769900," so i don't know um i don't know um i guess uh maybe we should uh make some sort of a report"
4769900,4774540," is it possible to save you can export uh to image right you can export the image"
4774540,4785420," or maybe it seems worse but it's due to higher competition among agents better agents maybe i"
4785420,4795340," don't know so uh let me see uh i'm not gonna close the pull request yet uh i'm gonna just actually"
4795340,4803980," provide a response with whatever we found and i also want to take a look at the um uh at the result of the"
4803980,4818540," jayang's uh generation"
4818540,4829820," what's up jang welcome welcome to the stream we're actually looking at your solution and we're trying"
4829820,4838140," to see if it's better or not uh and i'm about to write a response to you um i'm not sure if i want"
4838140,4843500," to merge it unfortunately so i'm gonna just provide the response with whatever we found"
4843500,4850300," and um then we can discuss that in the comments i suppose we can discuss that in the comments"
4850860,4860380," so here's the first image that we'll need to have um so uh plot origin 30 0 1 csv i wonder if i can"
4860380,4872060," copy paste things here um let me do it like that plot uh origin 30 0 1 csv csv with lines"
4872060,4877980," uh by the way thank you so much for submitting this uh pull request it was actually super interesting to"
4878940,4885100," to explore uh because we did like an actual data science and stuff"
4885100,4899260," um all right so here is my solution uh right it converges around this time and it stays more or"
4899260,4908300," less stable over time so this is actually three runs so let's actually save that uh to something like origin"
4909180,4918780," png uh origin png so that was saved so now this the music is so loud jesus christ"
4918780,4925100," at least for me like i'm sure if it's for everyone but it's just so loud for me"
4926060,4937820," uh query replace query replace query replace origin xi yang right so uh emacs now this is your solution"
4937820,4944780," so it's three rounds of your solution and this is amount of steps by the way amount of steps it took"
4944780,4955420," before uh everyone uh everyone died so it converges just but just backwards um yeah so this is uh your"
4955420,4966780," solution um g and png you can also do something like plot zero file with lines to make sure that we always"
4966780,4976140," have zero value on the graph uh all right so but i already saved the so i have to start over again"
4976140,4984620," apparently uh thank you thank you so much um so let's give it a try um do i have to do that in front of"
4984620,4991500," which file uh let's see uh let's see uh let's see it didn't work um"
4991500,4999980," it didn't work i'm sorry so i put this thing here maybe i did something wrong"
4999980,5008140," uh but yeah i'm really sorry i'm really sorry uh but i already have the uh the changes"
5009340,5015740," so but i hope at least it's readable uh origin so here's the origin here's the"
5015740,5021500," xi yang and now we need to compare them together now we need to compare them together"
5021500,5038940," so uh something like this let's just plot them so purple is my solution uh green is xi yang's solution"
5039580,5046780," so this is the amount of steps again in generation over 30 generations uh all right so and they're"
5046780,5061900," going to export that to the image so yeah i'm not sure but we're not really we don't really know"
5061900,5067100," what these numbers tell us we don't really know what this time was tells us as somebody said in the chat"
5067100,5076140," maybe the competition is so high uh that uh in jiang solution they just kill each other way way faster"
5076140,5081100," right so uh it just depends on how we measure the quality um"
5081100,5092460," so yeah we can take a look at the uh at the simulation simulator of the latest giant generation"
5093260,5101100," right and do they kill each other do they really kill each other i think they don't really some of"
5101100,5110700," the bundle together uh but a lot of them die just out of the hunger while they're moving"
5110700,5114700," so i don't think this is because of the higher competition there's something"
5116620,5121740," something weird going on something weird going on so um"
5121740,5132220," so let's actually also uh write the comments um"
5134380,5139180," uh i did a little bit of tests"
5139180,5148620," it's pretty much a black box lmao gp is hard yes it is hard it's just it depends on how you ask the"
5148620,5155020," question right so the kind of results you will get depends on what exactly you want to know right so i"
5155020,5162060," want to live longer do we want to have more interesting behavior how do you define a more"
5162060,5167500," interesting behavior how do you measure you can measure it if you define it maybe like it's just"
5168860,5174220," i don't know what what do we want like it's and that's why i i wouldn't say like you lost some some"
5174220,5179340," of the people in the chat say you lost you didn't lose in my opinion because it just depends on how"
5179340,5185900," we we define things there's there's no absolute here in my opinion um so but for now specifically for"
5185900,5199340," now i would like to optimize for longer living to be fair so for more steps in the simulation so i'm"
5199340,5204700," gonna actually put all of the all like everything we found uh into the comments i'm not gonna close"
5204700,5210060," anything um maybe you want to run your own experiments and stuff like that maybe you know"
5210060,5215580," so one of the things we probably want to do maybe we want to simplify making this kind of"
5215580,5224300," graphs that would be actually kind of cool right for example if the the trainer actually spit out"
5224300,5230940," uh like the data that you can plug into gnu plot super easily and just see like what's going on there"
5230940,5241980," so yeah i did a little bit of tests um i measured um plotting graphs with sdl i could do that but i mean"
5241980,5253980," it's kind of like outside of the scope of what we're doing um measured amount of uh steps um amount of steps"
5253980,5262060," in each amount of steps before everyone is dead"
5263740,5285340," um in each generation um during uh during three gp trainer gp trainer runs here are some graphs"
5285900,5295740," here are some graphs uh original uh behavior so uh here we're gonna have like a origin png"
5295740,5297260," uh"
5297260,5302700," yeah your modifications modifications"
5304460,5317100," uh uh here are some graphs uh here are some graphs um x is uh generation generation number y is uh"
5317100,5325580," amount of amount of these steps right amount of the steps original you guys share me here um"
5326140,5337980," uh origin png uh compare uh comparison so uh origin"
5337980,5343660," png okay so this is going to be the comment um"
5345420,5364380," uh um um it's kind of hard to tell uh what is better um because it depends on what we are trying to"
5364380,5373020," optimize optimize optimize here but to be honest"
5374540,5387100," right now right now right now i kind of want to optimize the amount the amount of steps uh in"
5387100,5392780," the run all right um"
5392780,5402220," so um i don't know what to make of it um"
5404540,5407740," um all right so let's actually put it here"
5407740,5419260," uh so this is origin png and i'm going to use a little bit of drag and drop magic right now"
5419260,5425260," uh because i think for these kind of situations drag and drop is actually super convenient like in my"
5425260,5433980," opinion like i'm not a big fan of using mouse and shit but drag and drop is super convenient"
5433980,5442140," sometimes not gonna lie i3 what the fuck is going on a trick why can't you just tell me to split my"
5442140,5449500," screen in half so i can just drag and drop some shit i don't know why it is so difficult but it is"
5449500,5456700," for some reason that difficult okay so where is my comment i remember that i was trying to make a comment"
5456700,5464780," happen somewhere and this is not here uh is this here this is not here either did i close the window"
5464780,5467500," did i straight up close the window what the fuck is going on"
5467500,5475100," i feel like i closed closed the window i don't know oh here it is okay okay i'm gonna get all right"
5475100,5480380," so here we're supposed to have origin png and i can drag and drop it here so it will embed it there"
5481020,5493020," so there we go so this was embedded um all right so um all right so your behavior um"
5497180,5505900," oh shit so this is how it's gonna look like um and then the comparison"
5505900,5509420," um"
5509420,5518540," all right uh so i'm not gonna merge it"
5519340,5527980," uh at this moment uh at this moment really sorry really sorry um"
5527980,5537740," so i don't know"
5541420,5553500," feel free to close this pr if you don't plan uh to do any uh future experiments"
5553500,5559500," uh so i i guess i'm researching but um"
5559500,5567500," right now i kind of want want like more steps and it doesn't really work out um but yeah"
5568620,5579100," um okay so this is how we're gonna do that uh thank you so much for your contribution"
5579100,5580780," uh"
5580780,5592060," i feel so bad because i actually like asked you if you want to contribute that right and"
5592860,5595100," now i'm telling you that i'm not gonna merge it"
5595100,5604620," why am i such a bad person i don't know um all right so"
5604620,5611660," uh thank you thank you though for spending your time on that uh it was actually super interesting uh"
5611660,5618220," like exploring all of that making a couple of runs and see the differences between the uh between the"
5618220,5626380," solutions um so but yeah thank you so much it was it was super interesting it was educational as well by"
5626380,5633180," the way so i wouldn't say it was a waste of time it was really educational and yeah at least i remembered"
5633180,5635980," how to use gnu plot um"
5638220,5642700," will be fine he will be fine he's dealing with java developers every day yeah"
5642700,5651740," thank you so much um cool that was interesting um"
5651740,5662380," so um i guess i can say that we're done with this pull request and we have another pull request"
5665820,5673420," did you click comment i think i did yeah i did i did i did click comment so maybe you need to refresh the"
5673420,5675980," page um yeah"
5675980,5687980," i really like how they don't start with zero which makes them confusing a little bit um but yeah"
5693100,5700780," so uh all right so this one's done so um here's the second pull request that was suggested by somebody"
5700780,5710140," else so let's take a look at that um partial implementation of life update and logging of stats"
5710140,5712860," all right so uh"
5712860,5722860," average longest shortest life amount of food eaten other variables from uh yeah from this issue a bit"
5722860,5728220," more difficult it's more difficult together also i included a gnu plot script what why didn't i look"
5728220,5731420," at that pull request first we should have actually looked at that first"
5731420,5740540," ah i mean more content of course more more content i forgot about that"
5740540,5752300," yeah all right so let's take a look uh gp logging dot c oh oh oh oh my god"
5752620,5766940," uh average lifetime log header log generation uh all right so and this is like a separate module right"
5766940,5774460," logging is a separate module i see so and in the trainer we just do log generation"
5775260,5785180," and oh oh oh my god oh my goodness um okay um let's actually fetch it and see how it performs i should"
5785180,5792300," have actually looked into that first it would simplify gathering uh all of this data uh yeah"
5792300,5797340," do i want to remove all of that i kind of don't want to remove all of that so i'm gonna actually put"
5797340,5805500," that into the data so uh thank you for the red arcania uh okay so let's actually remove all of that stuff"
5805500,5815020," here and yeah ah it's all mashed together now probably yeah okay so this data is useless now"
5816060,5829500," um might as well actually um all right better genes so uh let's take a look at that stuff"
5833900,5842540," gp gp gp gp gp today is a pull request day nice nice nice nice nice nice by the way uh after we merge"
5842540,5849820," this pull request you can probably use these changes young for uh like maybe exploring your solutions and"
5849820,5856860," your approaches and improving your solution if you want of course uh so yeah we'll see how it goes"
5857660,5877900," um um so add um so i'm gonna take this thing all right git remote at uh so and the branch they're using i"
5877900,5887500," suppose is stats uh suppose is stats and there we go so"
5887500,5903020," here are the stats so what i wanted to do i wanted to build everything and see how it goes"
5903020,5917180," so and let's do gp uh trainer uh let's do like 10 generations um"
5917660,5923660," oh yeah we're not uh we're not uh having any any optimizations now i'm not having any optimizations"
5923660,5931020," because i removed all of that did i yes i did uh all three and let's do a little of that all of that"
5931020,5933820," with all three there we go there we go"
5939260,5947660," gp trainer uh 10 output"
5947660,5951820," the fuck i didn't know that that is possible"
5951820,5957660," the fuck is this magic"
5960860,5962540," wait wait wait wait really"
5962540,5966300," that's cool"
5966300,5971740," so generations okay average lifetime"
5971740,5981580," huh they actually it's actually decreasing so uh max lifetime increasing minimum lifetime"
5981580,5986540," food eaten they actually eat more food over time that's actually super cool oh my god"
5987100,5990780," what if we actually do like 30 generations"
5990780,5998140," all right so um it's funny how average lifetime is in is decreasing"
6001340,6011660," but they're eating more food for sure they're eating more food"
6011660,6019340," i'm impressed actually what the fuck this is so cool"
6021020,6026460," um"
6026460,6027260," minimum lifetime"
6027260,6033340," yeah and so that will enable us with adding more different stats at some point"
6033340,6041820," um"
6041820,6043660," okay"
6043660,6054220," it's funny how average lifetime decreasing for some reason right like it's not decreasing it's actually"
6054220,6063100," more or less like stable yeah but they do optimize uh food consumption uh at some point so how many"
6063340,6067740," yeah we did 30 and this is the results so minimum lifetime maximum lifetime"
6067740,6071900," average lifetime maximum and food eating and stuff like that"
6071900,6079660," uh all right so i really like that i wonder how exactly that is achieved"
6079660,6085180," so you call log generations right"
6088060,6093820," so you also run gnu plot as an external uh command right so"
6093820,6098780," fang chi gifted a tier one sub to john"
6098780,6103740," thank you thank you so much for gifting us up and supporting the channel and john"
6103740,6107580," welcome to our epic data science club"
6108380,6112940," you're in during right in the epic data science you you passed the initiation"
6112940,6117500," by uh passing a pretty cool uh pretty cool uh changes"
6117500,6119500," gnuplot minus p"
6119500,6129100," so basically it live updates or something"
6129100,6134620," look at there like i don't understand how it life updates or"
6136860,6143420," um"
6143420,6152780," so it does it watch the file does it watch the file watch no"
6152780,6158140," so you run like i don't know how to use gnuplot so i've no idea how it happens so"
6158140,6164700," uh persists uh let's window survive after main gnuplot program exits"
6165420,6168300," so okay it watches the uh the file modifications"
6168300,6173340," it reads the data from the log file but what's the command that you used what's the flag that"
6173340,6176460," you used to make it do it or does it do that automatically by default"
6176460,6182380," uh that's what i'm trying to find i do understand that it probably watches the file"
6182380,6187900," uh but do you have to do anything special to make it do that or does it do that automatically"
6188380,6192220," i just don't know i just don't understand that so flag command uh something"
6192220,6199660," it's not pipes yeah apparently it's not pipes i think"
6199660,6209980," i just gave the gnuplot the file name oh okay so that means it does that automatically"
6210860,6217180," okay interesting i didn't know that gnuplot does that but i guess it makes sense right because uh"
6217180,6222780," quite often you want to have a program that just you know appends the data to to the file and you"
6222780,6230620," want to see it dated life so yeah uh cool uh there's also look at that"
6230620,6240060," uh are you planning to make a stream on weekend check out our schedule page also check out fiq check"
6240060,6249260," out project because you're obviously new here welcome to the stream and to the channel um all right so let's uh go"
6251260,6255900," um nice i'm gonna merge this one um"
6255900,6265660," so i'm not gonna close the uh the issue yet because maybe in the future we're gonna add more parameters"
6265660,6274060," there we're gonna add more parameters there and uh yeah that is very very interesting okay"
6275580,6283980," uh looks good to me thumbs up thank you for your contribution"
6283980,6291260," it kind of makes it depend on glue plot i'm not gonna lie but i don't know"
6291260,6299980," uh implementing our own plotter is kind of outside of the scope of the project so it probably will take too"
6299980,6308780," much time so i'm not gonna do that so um what if i don't have a gnu plot so that's an interesting"
6308780,6316540," question will it work so uh what if i do a petit perch uh perch plot"
6318220,6321820," so i'm gonna remove it is it gonna crash is it gonna crash"
6321820,6332620," so i also updated recently so i probably need to remove old linux headers we'll see"
6332620,6340060," um um um"

6419500,6423100," yes i'm removing linux kernel because who uses linux in 2020"
6423100,6429980," that was a mistake i i didn't expect that it's gonna do this kind of on the stream"
6429980,6432380," um"
6432380,6437820," oh wait a second"
6437820,6448860," oh okay so it's it's a different current it's an old kernel okay everyone come down it's an old kernel"
6449500,6455500," oh okay so yeah rest in peace network davers so i think it's it's yeah"
6455500,6458620," f in"
6458620,6460300," and"
6460300,6463260," why am i doing that like"
6463260,6468460," couldn't and and i'm actually afraid to do control c right now believe it or not like"
6469020,6470780," so it's"
6470780,6471980," so it's obviously doing something very important"
6471980,6476300," oh yeah i also have a windows on this machine yes"
6476300,6483340," yes i do have a windows on this machine i i completely forgot about that by the way"
6483980,6486860," oh god damn it exposed"
6486860,6491740," anyway i can expose but i don't use it like ever"
6491740,6492780," um"
6492780,6495500," so trust me"
6495500,6497660," um i don't use it"
6497660,6499900," i don't use it"
6499900,6501340," i swear"
6505020,6510860," all right so i think we're done with the pull request and the time has come for an actual"
6510860,6516460," software development so uh we i want to improve the entity lookup"
6516460,6527100," why are you using windows uh because i work as a freelancer sometimes and sometimes some some"
6527100,6529260," clients want to do some on windows"
6529260,6534140," i don't know it's just you know"
6534140,6537740," this kind of stuff no"
6537740,6539900," all right"
6539900,6549020," snappy gamer i game on linux these days to be fine"
6551580,6555180," all right so uh we are ready"
6555180,6559660," playing games i don't have time for it"
6559660,6570940," do you know win32 api i know it exists"
6570940,6577100," uh so yeah let's make it let's make a small break"
6580780,6586140," so small break three minutes i think three minutes should be okay"
6586140,6609100," all right let's make this let's make a small break and you guys have fun"

6815500,6815500," uh"
6815500,6832780," uh"
6832780,6832780," uh"
6832780,6832780," uh"
6832780,6850060," uh"
6850060,6855260," we find the matching coordinates we return uh this as a result of a query so which is"
6855260,6856220," also not optimal"
6856220,6858540," uh"
6858540,6865340," so i was thinking of the ways to improve it and i think there is like a super easy way to make it all of one"
6865340,6872540," instead of linear it's when you're looking up entities yes exactly exactly uh you're 100"
6872540,6873260," right"
6873260,6876460," so and this is what we're gonna try to speed up"
6876460,6877340," uh"
6877340,6883980," so where exactly we're doing where exactly we're doing um i think we're doing that in a step game"
6883980,6885660," right"
6885660,6891100," so um i think we even have like a category like whole category of functions"
6891100,6893100," that um"
6893100,6895500," do that for us"
6895500,6898060," so um"
6898060,6898940," yeah"
6898940,6899260," uh"
6899260,6904380," food in front of the agent agent in front of the agent wall in front of the agent and uh"
6904380,6910940," environment in front of the agent so this sort of like four functions uh perform the actual"
6910940,6918860," entity lookup um right so this kind of functions basically uh you ask is there a food in"
6918860,6925100," front of me and if it returns you a pointer that is not null that means there is here is the"
6925100,6933340," food and if it returns no um that means um there is no food there so you can try to do something else"
6933340,6938540," uh so um what would be"
6942380,6944060," i spill water all over myself"
6944060,6955900," the easiest way to optimize that um so right now in the game as i already said we have like array of"
6955900,6964380," foods array of walls and array of agents all right so what i'm thinking is that we can create some sort of"
6964380,6974860," like um map the fastest way uh the fastest way would be uh to have something like int uh foods map"
6974860,6978860," which has the size board width"
6978860,6981900," board width by board height"
6981900,6985660," you see where i'm going with that you see where i'm going with that"
6986460,6995900," so um essentially it will let you check whether there is a foot at x y coordinate in o of one"
6995900,7003500," it takes a little bit of memory right it actually consumes like relatively a big amount of memory but"
7003500,7011260," luckily we're living in 2020 and as you know in 2020 memory is cheap"
7012140,7017340," so i think i'm gonna go with that solution because it's super easy to implement by just consuming more"
7017340,7021580," memory and it's gonna be super fast because you just look up and there you go you don't need to"
7021580,7029580," implement any sophisticated data structures no hash maps no like black red trees nor any of this stuff"
7029580,7037260," it's just an array it's just a simple array i would even say it's a perfect hash map it's a perfect"
7037260,7044540," hashing because for each of the key we can actually perfectly map it to uh to a single uh cell without"
7044540,7055100," any collision yeah see what i'm talking about uh so yeah this is going to be an attempt uh and i suppose"
7055100,7065500," we still want to um to have foods array we still want to have it because food can be eaten or yeah"
7067260,7075260," we usually consume the food by marking it uh to be not eaten but to be fair with this kind of array"
7075260,7081340," if there is a food there we can just have one if there is no zero so"
7081340,7091420," let's just start working on that and we'll see how it goes so um yeah first i want to do a simple control"
7091420,7100140," run of how fast all of that goes so we're gonna do a simple training right uh gp trainer um yeah let's"
7100140,7106460," actually recompile everything from scratch just to be sure uh and also maybe create a separate branch"
7106460,7117020," the branch is going to be two there we go uh gp simulator a simulator and uh let's let's do a 30 runs"
7117020,7121740," like let's do 30 runs um to the output uh pin"
7121740,7135260," wait what oh trainer i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry"
7140540,7147980," so essentially what we're looking for here are the times right but it actually keeps stealing our"
7147980,7158060," focus i cannot keep them together i can do them like that though so so overall like it usually takes two"
7158060,7163900," seconds"
7163900,7177740," and by the way keep in mind that i don't have gnu plot installed on my machine"
7178780,7185500," according to uh apt package manager just just has a"
7185500,7203260," so this seems to be like a pretty good uh control run i gotta say"
7204940,7213020," um ppt package manager yeah exactly all right i think we got the idea maybe i think we got the idea"
7213020,7224780," so i i just need to save uh this stuff um yeah control control time txt so here's the control time i'm"
7224780,7233580," gonna copy paste this stuff here uh and i'm gonna just remove this kind of stuff so um there we go so this"
7233580,7240220," is the control timing um one of the things we're gonna do is uh"
7240220,7245900," increase the optimization level that will speed it up of course"
7245900,7254220," and uh on top of that uh we're gonna start working towards uh improving the lookup times"
7258940,7268780," so see game h so instead of this kind of stuff what we're gonna have is uh something like this so here's"
7268780,7275260," the foot um yeah foot is gonna be essentially integer um"
7275260,7287180," i wonder oh it's gonna be very very bad boots because um the typing of c is a little bit weaker than in c plus"
7287180,7291900," plus plus so doing something like that may not necessarily trigger compilation errors in all of"
7291900,7298940," the places that are necessary so i might as well actually rename the field so it will fail everywhere"
7298940,7305340," where uh we use this thing sorry about the warning it happens during the first time it reads the file"
7305340,7310380," it's okay we can fix that later don't worry about it um all right so let's actually go through the"
7310380,7319020," compilation errors and see what we have here so the first thing fails somewhere here uh unknown type foot"
7319020,7324620," uh really i didn't remove the type foot though did i"
7324620,7334460," did i already remove it i think i forgot yeah i forgot that removed it okay that makes sense uh so and i"
7334460,7343420," suppose here we might return just int so you can uh essentially set it to null if you want to if you"
7343420,7346700," want to consume it so this is one of the things you can do"
7346700,7357420," uh so what we do here is cell empty so we have coordinates right and you check"
7358860,7370620," um whether you have something there so and by the way this entire loop can be now replaced with um game foods"
7371980,7380060," um to be fair can i like have a better array can i have two-dimensional right i think i should have a"
7380060,7388060," two-dimensional right it would be way better uh yeah because uh then i won't have to do this you know"
7388060,7397740," mathematics gymnastics stuff uh yeah yeah so i can replace this entire array with just simple if um"
7400460,7407180," game foods position how do we store them is it"
7407180,7418700," yeah i think it makes sense to store them row wise so that means here we're gonna have height and here"
7418700,7423660," we're gonna have width so we're gonna store them row wise yeah because that's how we usually get stored"
7424220,7432540," so if we if we have any food we return zero so we just removed a loop and replace it with a single"
7432540,7434460," single uh array lookup"
7434460,7441260," just a single array look up and we're gonna probably do that for each individual loop here so"
7441260,7447260," it's probably gonna speed up uh this kind of stuff dramatically hopefully um so yeah let's let's go"
7447260,7453020," through through the rest of the stuff it's actually fool's underscore um all right so here's another"
7453020,7463900," thing we're initializing the the game so uh what we're doing here we're taking a random empty coordinate"
7463900,7469580," on the board right so it's a random empty coordinate to the board i think we need to save it somewhere so"
7469580,7478300," so it's a chord pause and now instead of initializing it like that we have to do pause y pause x equal one"
7478300,7487420," right so we're just indicating that there is a food there so yeah cool uh foods underscore i keep forgetting"
7487420,7493820," that it's foods underscore instead of just foods uh okay and here we have this kind of thing all right"
7493820,7499500," uh we take a coordinate in front of the agent"
7499500,7503740," uh and"
7503740,7515260," so that's coordinate in front of the agents also wrap it around i don't remember it does wrap it around perfect"
7516140,7529900," uh perfect perfect perfect perfect so now if uh game foods underscore uh in front y in front x"
7529900,7538060," we want to return a pointer to that foot right so then you can modify that cell if you want to"
7539420,7549580," and again we removed a loop with an if is food count used in the loop the same as width and height uh what"
7549580,7558700," i don't understand your question i'm sorry uh i really apologize i'm i think i'm dumb i just don't"
7558700,7565180," understand your question uh okay so what do we have here a food in front of the agent okay so this one has to"
7565180,7576140," be int uh if food not that uh we had a loop where you assigned one to food in loop cool"
7576140,7581740," uh thank you for letting me know that i had such loop"
7583580,7595900," no so uh if i say eaten so that means i have to do zero uh cool another one next generation"
7595900,7603420," fruit"
7607420,7613180," so okay so okay so what i can do here what i'm thinking to do here is mem copy"
7613180,7626380," uh so the destination is the next game foods underscore the source is a previous uh game foods underscore and"
7626380,7637180," the size uh size of um i suppose this foods i don't remember how it works on uh multi-dimensional race i"
7637180,7643900," think it should work okay i think it should work properly does anybody remember um i need to double"
7643900,7651580," check so if i have something like access uh five by five right and then i'm gonna"
7651580,7659900," i'm gonna do something like this and i'm also gonna include stdio and std lib"
7666940,7673420," just a second boys and girls all right seems good and then i want to just print uh f"
7673420,7680780," uh ld size of access and uh we're gonna just do gcc and let's see"
7680780,7693020," uh yep and it's actually hundred see it's actually hundred uh and we know that"
7694940,7700540," the size of ind is four multiplied by five multiplied by five 100 so it does actually return"
7700540,7706300," you like a size of an array in bytes cool so here we can do the following thing i think"
7706300,7712540," cool uh uh now let's take a look at the rest of the compilation errors"
7712540,7719900," uh do we have any other compilation errors okay so if we do have food"
7721260,7724140," okay so we're iterating through everything here"
7724140,7734060," all right the rendering could be a little bit slower"
7734060,7740940," but i don't think that it's going to be that much slower especially after we optimize all of the entities"
7740940,7748380," here it's going to be just a single uh single nested loop uh thrash five welcome to the stream how are you doing"
7748380,7755260," what's up function how are you doing board uh height plus plus wine"
7760860,7767580," what do you all right have you exercised it's very important to exercise it's very fucking important"
7767580,7770220," all right if the game"
7770220,7778460," foods of course underscore y x exercised"
7778460,7779900," nice one"
7782780,7786700," i'm going in an hour okay good luck enjoy your exercises"
7786700,7793580," i'm sure if it's actually easy to enjoy them but you gotta try them"
7793580,7798140," um all right so let's remove this kind of thing"
7798140,7805020," uh and uh yeah so rendering became a little bit slower because we have to iterate through all of these"
7805020,7809180," this mother flippers um but yeah so maybe"
7809180,7816860," okay so when we have this kind of situation and we have a different style here because i have not"
7816860,7820300," set up uh continuous integration so yeah"
7820300,7825420," uh all right so what we're iterating here log generations"
7832140,7833980," oh okay"
7833980,7839180," so food eaten"
7839180,7849420," i guess what we can do here is um calculate how much food we have on the board and subtract"
7849420,7857420," from food count and that's going to be food eaten essentially um right so let me give it a try so it's"
7857420,7863100," going to be food count uh like this and but we'll have to iterate through uh through the entire"
7863100,7869740," through the entire board once again uh board height so this is a board height"
7869740,7881740," then it's going to be uh x board width uh plus plus x if we have foods underscore"
7882860,7893340," y x that means we have a foot so we're going to do food count plus plus plus and food eaten is essentially"
7893340,7904620," uh food count like a big food count minus food count uh let's actually rename this thing because it's kind of"
7904620,7911180," weird that it collides with the constant food remaining right so this is a food remain this is"
7911180,7917900," uh how much food we had at the beginning and this is the remaining food um yeah i think it's i think it's"
7917900,7934300," can't we can't we can't we can't we do something like this"
7945500,7956300," so essentially we have that uh is there any difference in using x plus plus instead of plus plus x in loops"
7956300,7966860," uh of course check out c programming language book yes it's actually explained uh in in this book"
7967900,7973660," uh green berlin yeah it's actually pretty cool book i really recommend it and uh that question is answered"
7973660,7982460," there you're welcome uh now do the agents eat feet what the hell is this kind of question um"
7982460,7986780," um so we have that"
7986780,7993100," so yeah i think it's going to be correct i think it's going to be correct"
7994300,7998700," all right uh food count foods count i think"
7998700,8004780," okay seems good seems good all right um"
8004780,8012380," cool i want to go through the changes that i've made uh just to make sure that i didn't do any"
8012380,8019180," wacky wacky especially with the coordinates because uh we do like a row wise so that means first it has to"
8019180,8028540," be x uh y that's exactly what i want why i want to go through and check so y x uh so y x and what we're"
8028540,8036140," doing here we're generating the new food and that's why we set it to one okay cool um so this is y x and"
8036140,8042140," then we return the pointer to this so this is that and when it's it and we actually make it to zero then we mem"
8042140,8049020," copy this is destination this is that uh this is a height and width and there we go"
8049020,8053820," uh all right all right and"
8053820,8056540," to the two"
8056540,8066940," y x y x okay that's actually pretty cool um and i think it should now go a little bit faster we may try to do a"
8066940,8075020," simulation just to see if it uh you know works exactly as we expect um like you know a simple sanity"
8075020,8081900," check very simple sanity check and it seems to be working because they are eating the food i think"
8081900,8092060," maybe all right so and uh i'm gonna start training on 30 maybe 20 generations uh to the output bin"
8092700,8097580," right and uh all right"
8097580,8109820," do you see the speed we enabled optimizations and we also uh speed up the uh the entity lookup"
8109820,8117500," but there's something wrong with the food no it's a generation yeah yeah food eaten actually behaves the"
8117500,8125260," same as we expected uh to be fair it's not really fair right so i think we need to disable optimizations"
8125260,8132060," so to be a little bit more fair for this particular situation uh yeah we're using new plot it was"
8132060,8140620," actually uh contributed by uh john he basically made that when you start training it starts up"
8140620,8147820," gnu plot pointing at files uh where there's locks or something like that and it uh updates like in real"
8147820,8155660," time so that's actually super cool uh all right so i'm gonna do a full rebuild without any optimizations"
8155660,8161020," and we can take a look at how fast it is now uh so i think it's going to be a little bit more fair"
8163500,8175180," yeah it's still relatively slow but it's a little bit faster now i think it's a little bit faster"
8176940,8185020," is the plotting script in the repo yes here's the stats plot uh stats plot or something and also"
8185020,8193020," there's some scripts there okay i can't predict it um but yeah so i do feel like it's a little bit"
8193020,8217180," faster all right so this is the 20th generation um and let's take a look at the uh output bin"
8223020,8239580," okay okay that's really strange"
8239580,8250780," uh that is very very strange and i think i know why oh boy because we don't have original information"
8250780,8255820," about the foot position god damn it we just don't have that original information"
8255820,8265500," so um what do you use for mod slash prefix key in team ux"
8265500,8275980," i don't understand the question so um yeah we lose original information about like information about"
8275980,8283740," the original position of the foot which is kind of sad but maybe that's okay um"
8283740,8294060," maybe that's okay we can just store it there to be fair can we just start there i think we could just"
8294060,8306460," start there yeah um so because i want to like retain the original behavior"
8306460,8316380," uh what keys what i don't know i don't know what are you talking about i control x probably"
8317100,8321660," um why is it does it matter why does it matter why does it matter i don't understand all right so what's"
8321660,8325500," what matters right now is that we're losing the original uh coordinates um"
8325500,8330460," we're losing the original coordinates and this is a problem this is a real problem"
8331020,8339100," um so before i'm gonna go there so i might as well actually just you know keep uh origin food like"
8339100,8346940," this and then we're gonna have a food count right uh so we have like a food positions and uh their"
8346940,8353740," original positions so we can easily recover them um yeah but before we go into that i'm gonna just"
8353740,8363580," quickly rename this thing uh like this uh and go to the compilation errors so clear place"
8363580,8377340," um oh cat damn it okay thank you emacs very cool that was super cool thank you so much uh all right so"
8381900,8386140," yeah uh nice"
8386140,8392140," uh all right cool um now"
8392140,8398540," so let's do a committee committee"
8398540,8411660," improve food uh look up from o of n to o of one how about that"
8411900,8419420," mm-hmm isn't that epic food look up from o of one to o of n to o of one"
8419420,8426140," that's actually pretty epic so but in fact i intentionally made it super slow"
8426140,8432700," so i can then later easily change it to o of one and brag about it how about that"
8435180,8441420," uh all right let's push that right into the ripon optimization has been achieved"
8441420,8449740," um"
8449740,8454300," we aren't your manager you don't need to do that"
8457660,8465180," it's not really how streaming works i'm actually joking the reason why in i implemented slow solution"
8465180,8469100," in the first place is because it was just faster right because i was prototyping"
8470620,8475260," um so i was just prototyping so that was the actual reasoning behind that"
8475260,8479260," uh"
8479260,8486780," so but the problem with uh speeding it up is that it doesn't work correctly anymore"
8486780,8490780," look look we're losing information about the food so we don't have any food"
8491340,8495260," anymore like we just lost the food straight up"
8495260,8505740," implemented slow solution because it was faster to implement yes yes i implemented slow solution"
8505740,8507420," because it was faster to implement"
8507420,8515020," you're very funny you're christian thank you so much all right so let's let's remove that"
8518620,8525660," uh"
8525660,8530300," cool"
8530300,8534780," uh so here's the foods"
8534780,8547980," um i need to introduce cord um i don't know how to call it foods uh origin i think this is how we're"
8547980,8553980," going to call it and this is going to be array foods count so this is a foods uh like food origin stuff"
8553980,8564140," um and uh we need to go into two functions init game and make next generation so in the need game"
8564140,8572300," uh we're gonna store the uh positions we're generating to that array right"
8573580,8581020," and uh in the make next generation we're gonna simply recover uh the original positions so this is how"
8581020,8589900," we're gonna go about it so in it uh let's go to the game c uh in it game uh where is in game and when"
8589900,8596060," i'm generating a new food so okay this is where i'm generating a new food and essentially i do foods"
8596060,8607420," origin uh i equal pause i might as well well i mean okay i see yeah so i'm marking food existing here"
8607420,8613900," but i also actually saving it uh in a backup right so it's a foods backup all right and when i'm making"
8613900,8620220," a new generation i'm making the next generation uh i'm not just copying this thing right now but i"
8620220,8627500," do plan to copy foods uh origin so i'm copying the foods origin and then what i need to do i need to"
8627500,8636620," iterate through uh all of the foods foods count uh so next game"
8638700,8649420," so i can do something like court pause next game foods origin i and then next game foods"
8649420,8658940," pause y uh pause x is gonna be one something like this so yeah basically we restore the original"
8658940,8663260," positions of the food it's kind of a hack but it kind of gets the job done i think"
8664940,8673100," so sorting equals gerald i've no idea what the you're talking about but i agree with you so um yeah"
8673100,8683980," it seems to be compiling it seems to be compiling and let's actually run for a couple of simulations now"
8683980,8694460," so uh actually a couple of generations so trainer uh output pin and let's see if it works more or less you"
8694460,8702060," know believable"
8702060,8710060," so how everyone is doing"
8710060,8718540," the plots are so cool yeah they're pretty cool thank you john"
8723500,8731100," so this is just a sanity check just to see that after uh plot c uh just to see that after all"
8731100,8737660," of all of our changes uh we didn't break anything significant welcome back our man hello hello"
8737660,8739900," we're just speeding up the code"
8739900,8743100," we've almost done"
8749900,8753180," so did they actually run for 30 generations so did they actually run for 30 generations i think so i think"
8753180,8757500," it's 30 generations"
8757500,8765100," max lifetime is going for the max lifetime increasing we're actually pretty cool if the average lifetime"
8765100,8765100," increased as well"
8765100,8765100," and we're actually pretty cool if the average lifetime increased as well"
8765100,8765900," and we're actually pretty cool if the average lifetime increased as well"
8765900,8770060," and we're actually pretty cool if the average lifetime increased as well"
8770060,8787100," uh um um all right uh now uh gp simulator uh output bin and it seems to be okay the food is there"
8788540,8796860," the uh entities are moving they're doing things uh some of them are fighting some of them are looking for the"
8796860,8806300," food the food consumption is actually yeah it's not as big as it says but yeah"
8808300,8816060," something strange all right so i think uh i think we fixed everything um"
8816060,8829740," um save and restore original original food position there we go i'm gonna push that right to the reaper"
8831180,8838780," uh so so so the idea now is to the absolutely the same shed but uh for walls and agents themselves"
8838780,8846620," right so we did for the food we replaced linear array with all of one look up in the two-dimensional array"
8846620,8854620," uh so i think for walls is going to be super easy uh because we don't need to restore uh the walls"
8854620,8858860," because they are not consumable so we can just simply copy walls from previous generation to the"
8858860,8864300," new generation and it's going to work fine so the only thing we need to do here is just that just"
8864300,8872780," make it to them two-dimensional array and uh yeah we'll see how it goes right so and we don't even"
8872780,8879180," have oh we do have the the type for the walls yeah here's the type for the walls um so it consumes"
8879180,8882780," a little bit more memory but it gives us more speed hopefully"
8886620,8891260," there's no holy war everyone knows that sam is the best editor i do agree with you this is why i'm"
8891260,8896860," using it right now uh all right so we need to replace this thing with integer um"
8896860,8904300," and uh so what do we have here oh yeah so it's cell empty so we can replace the whole"
8904300,8909500," loop here with a similar condition just a single similar condition if"
8910620,8923740," uh game walls uh pause y pause x that means the cell is not empty that's it and we replaced this loop"
8923740,8928860," with just a single condition with a single of one lookup about that"
8928860,8936220," all right so we're going to continue now we are generating yeah we're generating new walls"
8937020,8943260," so uh i'm going to do it like that so it's going to be called pause there we go uh and now"
8943260,8950540," it's going to be pause y pause x and just one there we go super simple"
8950540,8955260," uh next one and it didn't work because this has to be underscore sure"
8957100,8970540," uh so this has to be integer now uh we have in front and if um if game walls underscore in front y"
8970540,8980460," in front x we're gonna return a pointer to this thing uh which is kind of dumb but that's okay"
8982780,8990540," it should speed things up anyway it should speed speed up things anyway uh all right so this one is int"
8990540,9005580," uh-huh and wait a second uh okay damn it wall in front of yeah i want to see who's using this function"
9006620,9015020," all right so then if we have a wall if it's no okay that makes sense that makes sense all right so the"
9015020,9024940," rest of the stuff uh the next of the game so and here i'm pretty sure we can simply uh copy one walls"
9024940,9029500," from uh from previous generation to the new generation so it's going to be mem copy um"
9031820,9040780," so next game walls underscore previous game walls underscore and it's going to be just size of uh"
9040780,9046140," previous game on this course so we can remove this uh entire right now um"
9046140,9052060," so what do we have here so in here it's actually kind of cool"
9052060,9056940," so yeah"
9061180,9071420," i can do it like that game walls y x if you have any walls here you just draw them here like this"
9071420,9080060," and i can remove this loop now so now we have a single loop that iterates through all of the"
9080060,9087980," uh cells and uh checks what kind of entity is there and uh just renders that entity accordingly"
9088940,9096060," that's right so uh yeah it's underscore of course because i uh renamed it uh"
9096060,9101260," for this one i think we can just do it like that so it's going to be x and y"
9101260,9109660," is it working now it seems to be working it seems to be twerking cool so i want to rebuild it one more"
9109660,9115180," time just in case and we can see if it actually uh runs faster so let's actually do a training"
9115740,9118140," uh and let's take a look at the speeds"
9118140,9126220," speeds don't seem to be that i think they do look a little bit faster"
9128540,9138700," no optimizations under two seconds"
9138700,9153020," well i mean it it grows over time but um yeah average lime life actually drops but then you know uh"
9153020,9165900," stabilize this over time did you read all three no i didn't add all three yet"
9174540,9178940," why does it say that all of the food is eaten i did i up somewhere badly"
9178940,9191500," okay i wonder where exactly i up but overall i think it's it's actually faster i think it's"
9191500,9196300," actually faster"
9196300,9208060," so and uh let's do a trainer let's actually do the simulation simulation uh i'll put bean yeah"
9208060,9210860," and this is the simulation"
9213340,9218780," like they don't like they don't even eat that much food i mean come on"
9218780,9235900," okay so uh let's continue let's continue um"
9238860,9247260," um so what was the was the original commit message that i put improve uh food lookup okay so this is one"
9247260,9248860," thing here um"
9248860,9258940," improve wall lookup from linear to o of one i'm gonna push that with the repo"
9260700,9273740," so we improved lookup uh for foods and walls for foods and walls and i think we can do a similar"
9273740,9279180," thing for uh the agents as well we can do a similar thing for the agents as well"
9280540,9284300," oh boy um as funny is that when we are"
9284300,9294300," hmm wait a second when we're doing the next generation how do we generate new one do we generate"
9294300,9299100," them in the original in their original states we don't really generate them in the in their"
9299100,9305100," original states we actually generate a completely new thing so maybe because of that we don't need to"
9305100,9312140," do this kind of yeah so make generation so"
9312140,9319900," we actually generate completely new oh like that means we don't need to store"
9319900,9324540," the foods position we can just regenerate them it's so dumb"
9329100,9342220," yeah it's so dumb so um just used python for what what do you mean i don't understand uh what should"
9342220,9354700," i use python for um so i think i want to remove the uh the thing"
9354700,9366300," uh the backup of the food positions because we don't back up the agents positions right um just use rust we"
9366300,9372140," program in rust every tuesday actually and uh we're developing ui framework and about you haven't"
9372140,9379980," watched me for quite some time so we're programming in rust quite often um yeah so i want to get removed"
9379980,9386060," this thing i think it's kind of pointless um but now before i do that i uh need to rename this thing"
9386060,9394780," this is a vast channel now i suppose uh walls underscore walls yeah"
9397980,9399660," and of course i did a fucker wacky wacky here"
9399660,9402460," uh yep"
9402460,9411580," yep cop yep cop yep cop yep cop all right"
9411580,9420620," guys are you coffee drinkers no i'm vodka drinker who drinks coffee in russia"
9420620,9422780," fucking cringe um"
9422780,9430220," any other tips for keeping energy and focus during programming session vodka just drink more vodka"
9430220,9436540," all right"
9436540,9443260," um so um so let's rename this thing"
9445340,9452540," uh walls underscore to just walls uh what's gonna be next what's gonna be next"
9452540,9454300," um"
9454300,9458140," yeah removing this stupid ass"
9458140,9463180," backup positions let's go ahead and do that all right"
9463180,9467020," so when we're generating you think we don't need to back it up"
9467020,9474380," fuck that and here i don't need to copy anything but i do need to uh go through all of these things"
9474380,9478540," yeah i can just take a random empty coordinate on the board"
9478540,9484700," uh just take a random empty coordinate on the board and just generate this shit there we go"
9486700,9493260," uh and i think it's gonna be uh very interesting i think it's gonna be very interesting and i think it worked"
9493260,9496860," um so on top of that um"
9496860,9504220," i think i want to do a similar thing for the walls we're gonna generate new walls uh every time"
9504220,9507420," yeah we're gonna generate new walls every time"
9508620,9516220," so uh so this is the next game i'm iterating through walls through all of the available walls"
9516220,9524140," so here's the random position on the board of the next game and here's the walls uh and there we go"
9524140,9530300," let's rebuild all of that so and i want to do a simple control test just to see if we didn't do any"
9530300,9538540," if i keep what the fuck is this shit well apparently we did a fucky wacky what the fuck is that"
9538540,9554140," oh shit um excuse me uh if i actually stash that and um okay this is why i do control tests uh"
9554140,9562620," because sometimes you do a fucky wacky is inevitable quite often so that means i introduced some changes"
9562620,9569260," that did that okay so this is without the changes and then i go back to my changes i'm gonna pop them"
9569260,9577500," out and try to recompile that one more time and i'm gonna try to run it and there we go i in fact"
9578380,9585900," did a quite obvious fucky wacky all right so we removed that so there's nothing wrong here so"
9585900,9593420," there's absolutely nothing wrong here so we just don't save this shit anymore um so food's origin"
9593420,9598780," essentially what we do here we just try to find an empty coordinator on the next game board and that's it"
9599500,9607740," um"
9607740,9612380," i've just seen problems"
9612380,9625340," i know why this is because i'm reading from an old binary file that has a completely different format"
9625340,9630540," because we changed the schema of the game so the binary format is completely different and it actually"
9630540,9638940," read it incorrectly um commit every thunk and use bit bisect yeah that's probably what i would do if i"
9638940,9644380," couldn't find the problem but i found the problem i actually run uh with a binary file and this binary"
9644380,9651580," file is just too old right it contains uh data in completely wrong schema and it basically what it does"
9651580,9659260," it displays the memory garbage at this point uh no retro compatibility yeah this is because these dumps are"
9659260,9667500," you know recreatable very easily so um and these are literally memory dumps actually so we just dump the"
9667500,9673020," memory like the whole game state so it's just easier to do it like that and see um yeah"
9673020,9680220," so um i think there's no particularly error here so the only thing we need to do we need to do gp trainer"
9681020,9688300," uh 20 and we're gonna output it to the output binary and if after that it's gonna work that means"
9688300,9689020," everything's okay"
9689020,9694380," you can't import them on big engine exactly"
9694380,9701660," write a tool to convert old format to the new one uh it's kind of outside outside of the scope of what"
9701660,9711740," what i'm doing i'm doing i'm sorry um now how am i gonna do genetic programming on my ibm mainframe"
9711740,9720780," you just don't use dumps that were made on other machines so that's simple actually uh but on top of"
9720780,9725740," that okay we also have a issue uh we also have an issue"
9725740,9733420," the proper format for saving loading game states the only reason why i'm using memory dumps right"
9733420,9738300," now is that because we don't have a proper format and developing the proper format is actually takes time"
9738300,9745100," so it was just easier to for me to take like the memory and dump it to the file system because i needed"
9745100,9751820," to transfer memory from one utility to another one and it was just the easy solution come on i mean it's"
9751820,9759420," quite common it's quite common of a solution um and those dumps don't really live that long anyway so"
9759420,9763580," whatever i suppose um all right"
9763580,9768860," cool"
9768860,9771740," um"
9771740,9776940," regenerate uh regenerate"
9776940,9788380," uh walls and foots on each generation from scratch i'm gonna push that right into the rhythm"
9789660,9794620," pushy pushy and committee committee that's right"
9794620,9801500," they're going to paralyze all the stuff using p thread or something another"
9801500,9813820," no i'm not going to do that i think it's a kind of strange idea i'm not going to use that"
9814700,9819660," thank you for asking though um i do not have any plans to paralyze this kind of stuff"
9819660,9822700," um no"
9822700,9827980," is everyone dead i really like this function"
9837260,9838860," yes yes um"
9838860,9845500," now game that h and"
9845500,9852940," so we're gonna do the same thing"
9852940,9857100," uh"
9857100,9863180," same thing for agents but for agents is going to be slightly different"
9864540,9869740," for agents is going to be slightly different because uh they actually have their own state"
9869740,9872380," they actually have their whole like state and stuff"
9872380,9881180," so they also contain position"
9881180,9886620," so i think we're gonna have something like agent"
9889260,9889820," and then"
9889820,9891900," and then int"
9891900,9893020," agent"
9893020,9894460," map"
9894460,9896300," board height"
9896300,9897820," and board width"
9897820,9900380," right board height and board width"
9900380,9901500," so and"
9901500,9903500," if it's zero"
9903500,9908220," oh we may have agents with the with the index zero"
9908220,9910940," if it's minus one that means there is no agent there"
9910940,9916060," if it's the index of the agent we'll have to look up that agent in this map"
9916700,9919260," uh yeah in in this array"
9919260,9922940," so and uh we don't really need coordinates here do we"
9922940,9926220," i'm not really sure if we need coordinates here so"
9926220,9928540," we'll see maybe we do need them"
9928540,9933900," but yeah so that should actually speed up looking up agents because now"
9933900,9935900," you can just uh look into that map"
9939900,9940460," um"
9940460,9945820," and i think it would be also pretty cool to rename these things to map as well"
9945820,9951100," right so you sort of have maps that indicate that we have something there"
9951100,9953100," uh"
9953100,9960620," now uh what i want to do here i want to just recompile everything and just go through the compilation stuff"
9962220,9968460," so okay it's cell empty i still cannot decide if i want"
9968460,9974620," how i'm gonna even do that how i'm going to do that"
9974620,9982300," so is zero in the cell of the agent maps will represent the empty cell"
9983260,9989820," because that will be natural because we mem set to zero the whole game and that's supposed to be a valid state"
9989820,9991500," so maybe"
9991500,9999020," yeah maybe if it's not zero it represents the agent with the index minus one of it"
10000300,10002620," so that's probably what we'll have to do here"
10002620,10006700," that's probably what we'll have to do here"
10006700,10016620," do you see what i'm talking about you see what i'm talking about because i'm planning to use like a"
10016620,10018780," value of the cell as an index"
10018780,10026540," um all right so i think i think it should be pretty straightforward so uh game agents"
10027580,10030540," uh cause y cause x"
10030540,10034060," right and then return zero so and look"
10034060,10034940," now"
10034940,10036860," this function"
10036860,10043580," actually performs three checks that are all of one and this is like the whole function is all of one"
10043580,10047660," like to check whether a cell is empty it's just that"
10047660,10054940," um it's pretty straightforward so and this one has to be agents map i suppose this is a foods map"
10056060,10059580," and this is a walls map speed is key yeah"
10059580,10066780," because before we we had like three four loops here now it's just four ifs and we just check"
10066780,10072060," three arrays right uh for different kinds of entities right it's just three arrays for different kinds"
10072060,10079260," of entities um we might as well actually have like a single array that contains an environment"
10081180,10085260," still not branchless though um maybe we can do something like"
10085260,10095420," like this or this or this we'll see maybe uh maybe you can make it by branches it feels like"
10095420,10099580," you can make it branches if you think about it um"
10099580,10111900," so to make it branches it has to be not that and not that and not that i think yeah"
10113820,10129100," so uh game agents map pose y pose x not that and not foods and"
10131900,10132700," not walls"
10132700,10140060," yeah so would that be branchless i think i think it would"
10140060,10147740," they actually generate jump ah okay so we can probably use these things then"
10149500,10154860," yeah so how about that so"
10154860,10160060," what do you think"
10160060,10166300," would that be branchless"
10170540,10174860," yeah memory access could be slower yeah i agree uh"
10174860,10185420," so we'll see because they are located like in different like arrays and if they are like don't"
10185420,10192060," fit all of them don't fit into the single cache it could be actually quite bad uh look because they're"
10192060,10197020," located like near to each other in the memory but all of them may not necessarily fit into the cache if"
10197020,10199580," they're too big right so"
10199580,10212300," we'll see"
10212300,10219500," maybe we can make them parallel arrays or something uh or maybe again um we can"
10219500,10224860," basically have a single map where we can have an environment but then i couldn't use"
10225420,10229820," the id of the agent there um which i want sometimes so"
10229820,10238780," i don't know we'll see so um it's a completely different way of optimizing things"
10238780,10248940," store them on gpu with cuda we have an issue for that uh but actually it's more about opencl right"
10248940,10257500," so i do plan to check out opencl at some point um can you have like a raising opencl i think opencl is"
10257500,10262780," just like very similar to cool day is it not i think it should be because they're sort of like"
10262780,10265660," competitive competitive competitive technologies"
10265660,10279500," so what do we have here so we do that then we generate all of the chromosomes of these things"
10279500,10281500," like this"
10281500,10290380," uh all right and then like this and then we have to put that to the map so this one is going to be game"
10291260,10297740," agents map so and this is the position okay so let me actually put that position somewhere here so it's"
10297740,10306140," going to record position um all right this is the position and then we do it like that pause y"
10306140,10313020," pause x and it's going to be actually the id but it's not going to be just i"
10313740,10320220," because zero is a valid index for the agent so we're going to make a convention that the index that"
10320220,10330140," is stored in the agent map is i plus one it's i plus one because uh zero indicates uh no agent right"
10330140,10339980," so zero indicates no agent so that means it's i plus one okay cool uh now what do we have here so"
10339980,10347740," foods this thing is a food food's map and this is a wall's map uh what's next here's the agents okay"
10347740,10350700," cool"
10350700,10357020," agents health seems okay"
10357020,10366620," all right wait a second so agent in front of agent yeah okay this is actually pretty cool so this is"
10366620,10379820," where we can make an optimization actually uh so now if game agents game agents uh uh map"
10379820,10389180," in front y and in front x if you have energy agent and that particular cell what you can do now"
10389980,10401420," um you can do something like this right since this thing is agent index plus one you have to do"
10401420,10404380," minus one here and you have an index um"
10404380,10414300," right and then what you have to do you have to also check that"
10415580,10422700," oh so we don't really need to yeah we will now have a way to indicate that agents are dead but i'm gonna"
10422700,10428620," still keep it like that so um yeah and if"
10428620,10437100," the house of that agent right the house of that agent is greater than zero um"
10439100,10450380," yeah we have to return that agent yeah so this is in front index this is in front index look at that"
10450380,10457980," chat yeah so now we've removed that for loop now we have two checks so we check if we have something"
10457980,10464540," here so we retrieve the index of that uh engine then we check that it's dead and we then return it and i think"
10464540,10472060," when the agent dies uh when the agent dies uh we can simply remove it from the agent's map and that will"
10472060,10484700," enable us with removing uh this particular check uh so when the agent dies uh just um remove it from the"
10485740,10497820," agent's map so you don't need uh okay so this is going to be in the body so you don't need to"
10497820,10508780," check its health uh health in agent in front of agent agent in front of agent function so this is going to be"
10508780,10515820," the to do uh this is going to be the to do so let's recompile everything one more time so this one has"
10515820,10523820," to be underscore uh all right cool wall in front of agents uh so this one has to be underscore this one"
10523820,10533980," is going to be map all right everything is correct here uh-huh uh-huh so this one is also pretty correct"
10536300,10542620," um so and here is the interesting part i suppose"
10542620,10550540," uh-huh all right this is not that interesting of a part because i didn't see any changes that needs"
10550540,10557020," to be done here uh upper 420 welcome to the stream really glad to see you hello hello up how are you"
10557020,10565420," doing how are we doing buddy is everything's okay um"
10565420,10568860," so this is a step agent"
10568860,10577820," i crashed my pc twice today trying to benchmark a program nice uh"
10580060,10586940," cool i don't know why that would be nice but that means that was a pretty hardcore benchmark"
10586940,10590700," ran out of ram well just download more ram i suppose"
10590700,10595020," oh yeah so maybe you should have just increased the swap"
10595020,10603500," no swap oh that's actually kind of dangerous living on the edge"
10607340,10613100," how much swap does dennis have in on his machines like it's like 80 gigabytes of swap"
10613100,10618780," and he and he keeps saying that it's justified because he's sometimes run software that"
10618780,10620140," needs that much of memory"
10620140,10627740," swap saved multiple times yeah same swap is super important in my opinion"
10632220,10635660," okay when you step in an engine did we go into stepping an engine yet"
10635660,10642940," oh okay stepping an edge agent is actually yeah it's also supposed to modify"
10642940,10647500," oh all right"
10647500,10656060," it's also supposed to modify the map but it doesn't modify the map unfortunately"
10657740,10661900," um"
10661900,10669740," i thought it was in video uh in video driver at first but after it happened twice i realized maybe i was"
10669740,10678700," running out of ram yeah uh how are we gonna do that i suppose the easiest way to do here would be"
10678700,10684220," to just accept the game uh right to accept the game"
10686220,10692540," and uh the agent index and actually you know update"
10692540,10700300," this stuff and uh then update the uh the agent map as well i'm not sure how it's gonna go"
10700300,10707580," uh but maybe i want to do that after i finished with the refactoring so um yeah"
10708780,10713180," step agent should uh update agent map"
10713180,10720940," the jvn doesn't have a lot of memory errors so i had sick faults while"
10720940,10725020," starting the program and it costed way too much time to debug that"
10725020,10726540," uh"
10729260,10735020," yeah it's true dude did they say dude i got them thank you thank you so much"
10735020,10736620," too"
10736620,10748060," all right so agents we're just turning them left and right and stuff like that"
10749660,10751900," and stuff like that agents underscore"
10751900,10754860," agents"
10754860,10762860," it handles out of memory for user programs but not for internal stuff it's kind of interesting why"
10762860,10770380," well it's additional like branching and stuff and jvm is trying to be as fast as possible"
10770380,10774220," i suppose maybe to think about it"
10774220,10782140," i don't know i i don't know other reasoning this this one seems like pretty logical to me"
10783820,10787580," uh there's a program you use a pre-allocated bum allocator ah okay"
10787580,10792940," hello sofian69 nice"
10792940,10800620," i i like bum better so i think i think we should actually come up with a bum allocator"
10800620,10807500," yes you know there are linear allocators and there is there is a bum allocator the one that is used by jvm"
10809020,10813820," it sounds like something that uh jvm would use it would use a bum allocator"
10813820,10816780," uh so"
10816780,10821980," so and uh agent wait a second"
10821980,10825100," uh oh"
10825100,10847100," okay i think i'm not gonna actually uh do linear lookup for agents right now because it's too much of a work"
10847900,10849900," um so um"
10849900,10857820," yeah i think i'm gonna create a separate to do for that it's just gonna be separate to do um"
10857820,10861980," so gp game dot h"
10861980,10872620," implement uh o of one look up for agents i think this is not the right place for this thing"
10873580,10877020," so agent in front of agents so this is the right place for this thing"
10877020,10882540," uh this is the right place for this thing"
10882540,10890540," okay so let's actually compare the performance so i don't have any optimizations enabled right so"
10890540,10898220," there's no optimizations enabled here and i'm running 20 generations okay okay so uh there we go"
10903580,10908060," um"
10908060,10914300," no optimization by the way no oh three or something or something like that nothing special"
10914300,10925820," so and it's like around like 1.5 under two seconds right so it's under two seconds and uh"
10926540,10928140," this is how it was before"
10928140,10931820," oh did i do clean"
10931820,10939820," i removed the control time because i did bleed clean fdx"
10939820,10950220," all right so we'll have to do it again then uh control txt i'm gonna do that out of the uh out of the folder"
10952300,10955660," uh all right so now uh"
10955660,10965100," so i'm gonna do something like uh um additional work"
10965100,10972220," all right so um yeah let me push that right into the return"
10977900,10984620," so and i'm gonna go to the master and uh i'm gonna rebuild everything so i'm gonna go to the place"
10984620,10988460," before any optimizations right so we don't have any optimizations here right now"
10988460,10993020," um so i'm gonna run it right now and"
10993020,11003980," yeah the first generation to simulate already takes like three seconds so this this is the time before any"
11003980,11005420," asymptotic optimizations"
11005420,11008380," right so this is the time"
11008380,11011740," without any asymptotic optimizations"
11011740,11017980," uh this is okay so i'll have to i have to actually kill it so it's two seconds or something"
11017980,11024380," uh but this is the time after asymptotic optimization so it's actually improved like quite well"
11024380,11026140," so um"
11026140,11033820," you see isn't it cool so this is the time before uh our manual optimizations this is uh time after"
11033980,11040380," our manual optimizations and we didn't enable any o3s yet yeah so and we're gonna actually enable"
11040380,11040860," o3"
11040860,11053340," so now let's go uh gp make a file"
11059020,11060780," so it's gonna be something like this"
11060780,11070620," make it even faster sorting sure this is exactly what i'm gonna do now don't worry about it"
11070620,11072940," uh like this"
11072940,11080300," uh so we're gonna enable o3 for even faster experience"
11085900,11087900," uh all right"
11087900,11095740," so this is the time with uh manual asymptotic optimizations plus o3"
11095740,11102780," half of a second a single generation half of a second"
11111340,11114940," almost three times yes it's only three times uh no improvement"
11114940,11123020," it's actually pretty cool and we don't use any like open mp or anything like that and also i"
11123020,11129500," need to uh implement all of one look up for agents like all of one look up for agents"
11130380,11135100," um so yeah all right so"
11135100,11143020," enable o3 i'm gonna push that right into the repo so we're about to create the pull request i'm not"
11143020,11149980," sure if it makes sense to create the pull request we don't have any ci um but yeah let's see"
11155660,11161900," so speed up and it's gonna close the issue too"
11161900,11166860," push straight into the master"
11166860,11172540," i didn't force push why are you incrementing the counter i didn't force push okay"
11172540,11180700," i didn't force push so this is how many changes we did and uh that's pretty fast i gotta say"
11181420,11187580," um force push straight into the master that's a good idea thank you for suggesting that i really"
11187580,11194940," appreciate that so i'm thinking how we're gonna look up agents properties too many exchanges oh my god"
11194940,11204860," uh anyway i also wanted to check uh simulation output being yeah okay so this is how it looks like"
11205820,11211660," and we can actually probably like make hundred generations super quick"
11211660,11219500," chat look look at that conga line look at that conga line just just look at them look at them"
11219500,11221820," they're moving in the conga line"
11221820,11233500," they actually killed each other after some time uh yeah human centipede my favorite movie all right so uh"
11233980,11239660," training uh let's actually do 100 uh 100 iterations and see how fast it's gonna do that"
11239660,11247340," oh sh*t gnuplot is i i hate this gnuplot to be fair like what the f*ck"
11247340,11256140," uh uh luis manfroney oh oh thank you thank you so much for two months"
11256140,11262620," of tier one subscription and thank you thank you thank you and welcome to our epic uh genetic programming club"
11262620,11270060," you are now a two-time champion of the channel somebody kill me all right so uh let's let's go"
11270060,11275900," ahead and try to do that one more time yeah so it's gonna be 100 generations and i wonder how much time"
11275900,11282140," wait a second for for like a proper thing what we need to do uh we need to uh actually time it"
11284540,11295980," uh yeah there we go so we're timing it now and i wonder if it's gonna you know uh actually improve our time"
11301500,11307980," thank you thank you thank you i really appreciate it because that was embarrassing so after that i don't know"
11307980,11309740," um"
11317420,11325260," to be fair like something is improving the average lifetime does not improve right so it but the max"
11325260,11334380," slowly growing maybe uh kill studying with kindness thank you you're very kind we're already at 69"
11334380,11341900," generation look at that time this is actually amazing like it trains so fast um maybe i can just"
11341900,11347260," make a million overnight uh but it doesn't make any sense because it converts pretty much it's kind of"
11347260,11352780," pointless to do any training at this point because it's pretty much converged uh especially in terms"
11352780,11359260," of the max lifetime like look at that max lifetime it's just yeah that's it there's nothing much we can"
11359260,11367100," do and uh to to train like 100 generations it took one minute when i'm streaming when i'm streaming when"
11367100,11372460," i'm not streaming it's probably going to be like a half of a minute uh yeah so that's actually pretty"
11372460,11380460," cool uh food eat and it's pretty much max out yeah so if it maxes out uh it it's pointless to do"
11380460,11389900," anything else it just stays at the same level uh so simulator uh output output bin and this is the"
11389900,11396060," hans's generation this is straight up hundreds generation and they're just trying to kill each other"
11396060,11404460," that's what they're doing essentially um all right some of them even survived survived a little bit"
11404460,11415100," longer um try on a smaller grid um maybe turn off stream please we want to know how fast it is if you"
11415100,11424540," aren't streaming sure i'm gonna do it right now don't worry about it so you know what's cool about this build"
11424540,11434060," i can make the board 10 by 10 and it's not going to compile too many entities can't fit all of them on"
11434060,11442460," the board so yeah so we actually have a compile time check that the amount of entities you're trying"
11442460,11450940," to generate is not going to fit there so we have 100 uh slots so that means i can say uh i'm gonna generate"
11450940,11458780," like 50 agents right this is gonna be 50 agents uh maybe foods are gonna be like 10 and wall maybe walls"
11458780,11466940," is gonna be 10 but uh then we're gonna have 25 of these things uh all right seems to be working seems"
11466940,11473500," to be twerking and we're gonna do gp simulator uh this is how it looks like now it's pretty cramped i can"
11473500,11478220," i'm gonna say maybe we have to do like less agents uh let's actually make 25 of them"
11478220,11487180," let's make 25 of the agents uh yeah so they they have no idea what to do to be fair"
11487180,11489820," they literally have no idea what to do"
11492220,11499500," and actually i think it's gonna converge very slowly because there's not that many agents for uh"
11499500,11506940," rng to kick in properly so it probably will take a lot of generations and to to produce something"
11506940,11512060," something interesting so we're gonna we're gonna try it for 100 generations and see if it's even"
11512060,11517740," converges to anything uh excuse me"
11517740,11523500," did it actually finish them or something what the is going on"
11523500,11532700," i don't know what happened it did sick fault wait a second it's sick faulted what the how did"
11532700,11539180," this sick fault oh all right uh that's very interesting i didn't expect the sick fault so"
11539180,11548940," thank you for suggesting that no borrachecker exactly uh 100 output bin so where exactly it's sick faulted"
11548940,11552700," uh assert unreachable"
11555340,11559340," that is really strange okay one more time"
11559340,11566540," all right it doesn't produce a sec fault a game c"
11566540,11571660," where does it suck for 296"
11571660,11582460," so essentially action that is somebody trying to put here"
11584060,11586860," um"
11586860,11594380," it's actually pretty good that i put in uh put"
11594380,11600620," an assert here so there's it means there's uh it means there's a memory corruption here"
11600620,11606620," who's corrupting the memory who's corrupting the memory i wonder"
11609180,11618220," uh to to the tune okay execute action so it's happening in execute action so main step game execute action"
11618220,11626780," uh gp trainer all right and execute action"
11631020,11653740," also by the way it's kind of strange that um i forgot to remove that thing"
11656380,11658060," uh i forgot to remove underscore"
11658060,11661740," wait a second"
11661740,11670380," no i didn't okay everything's okay"
11678380,11685580," how does that execute execute action where do we use that"
11693900,11707420," i have an idea i have an interesting idea"
11707420,11708780," um"
11708780,11722780," um um"
11722780,11727580," um"
11727580,11747820," fair enough fair enough"
11747820,11749900," fair enough"
11749900,11754780," okay"
11754780,11758060," okay uh gdb one more time"
11758060,11764780," um run 100 output it doesn't really sec fault in"
11766220,11769900," yeah it does not sec fault um"
11769900,11773980," in debugger"
11781180,11794380," it basically corrupts the memory at some point i just don't understand why how"
11794380,11797820," simulator"
11797820,11803420," okay it also sec faults here which is actually nice"
11803420,11809100," so uh something with the next generation what are we doing with the next generation though"
11810460,11811500," uh let me see"
11811500,11827580," um"
11827580,11829740," game next generation so next generation is doing something very very"
11829740,11830220," fucking"
11830220,11838540," all right so um for the next game i'm just okay so we first of all we clean up the next game completely"
11839180,11842700," so then we're generating new foods we're generating new walls"
11842700,11843980," um"
11843980,11848860," so then we made agents together mutate them"
11848860,11857260," i don't see any problems we don't use mem copy anywhere here so it's not a problem"
11857260,11860220," it's not a problem"
11864380,11865580," it's a random direction"
11865580,11865660," it's a random direction"
11865660,11871580," it's a random direction there's something wrong with the next generation"
11871580,11877980," let me try to reproduce that i wish i could do just gdb and just run it and"
11877980,11883580," it is not reproducible in the debugger"
11884860,11888220," then if i try to do that thing in gp simulator"
11888220,11890940," it is it's sec false"
11890940,11896860," wall grind i am afraid that wall grind may uh"
11896860,11900220," show a lot of that is not related to"
11900220,11905100," to the application itself and a lot of related to"
11907260,11911820," to sdl because sdl actually leaks the memory as like like crazy"
11914540,11920060," uh when you said i it sounded like you want to say oh yeah yeah that's exactly what i wanted to say"
11920060,11920780," thank you man"
11920780,11926060," so sdl makes wall grind unusable by the way it's just annoying"
11926540,11930620," um um so uh let me let me give it a try"
11930620,11937100," uh maybe okay gp trainer does not link with sdl so it doesn't matter all right um"
11937100,11947020," but we okay we we link with this deal but we don't do that okay so we don't we don't run it uh gp"
11947020,11958460," trainer 100 um output bin i just forgot what i wanted to zap i'm sorry that was my reaction uh all right"
11958460,11970540," okay so invalid uh read of size 16 mate agents okay that makes sense mate agents"
11972140,11980300," uh uh 373 so why would that be an invalid"
11980300,11993980," uh read of size 16. address is not stacked maloct or recently freed"
11993980,11998540," okay"
12002140,12011020," is that optimizations"
12011020,12011580," is it optimizations"
12011580,12012780," wait a second"
12012780,12023740," oh no it is not optimizations"
12023740,12031980," all right so which is actually good because i don't want to lose this optimization"
12032140,12036060," what did i do"
12036060,12042300," this is why you should program in python am i right"
12046300,12052540," file run let program crash on gdb exe core uh i don't want to do that for some reason"
12052540,12057580," sorry sorry i don't want to do that"
12057580,12058540," um"
12058540,12061500," oh green okay"
12064780,12072140," um for this terminating with default action of signal 11 6 seg"
12072140,12074860," why okay"
12074860,12077740," make next generation"
12077740,12080780," trainer"
12080780,12083740," make next generation"
12085260,12085740," games"
12085740,12085820," games"
12085820,12088700," there's two of them"
12088700,12099500," does it go outside"
12099500,12101900," somehow"
12101900,12105740," uh"
12108620,12109260," um"
12109260,12113340," that would be a kind of an interesting explanation actually"
12113340,12125420," no is they just flip-flop i suppose"
12125420,12129340," they're supposed to flip-flop"
12132620,12133340," hmm"
12133340,12143260," so something with the size but what's funny is that it's not reproducible on bigger boards that's what makes"
12143260,12143980," it funny"
12143980,12157260," selection pool"
12157260,12163180," selection pool"
12163180,12164540," is big"
12164540,12169100," is bigger than agent count oh my god"
12169740,12170460," i found it"
12170460,12175020," selection pool is bigger than aging count genetic programming"
12175020,12181900," thank you so much for 23 months of tier one subscription"
12181900,12183580," thank you thank you thank you and welcome"
12183580,12187180," to our uh genetic programming club welcome back"
12187180,12190940," god damn it i lost 20 viewers to that"
12190940,12192300," god damn it okay"
12192300,12196780," so the the problem here is that we just take first"
12196780,12202700," and agents to mate and apparently the selection pool turned out to be bigger than"
12202700,12205340," amount of agents we have at all"
12205340,12206540," so"
12206540,12210540," it would have would have not happened if i did a simple thing"
12210540,12217340," if i just asserted that selection pool is less or equal than agents count"
12217340,12220220," and if i add this thing here um"
12220220,12223900," selection pool"
12223900,12226780," uh is bigger"
12226780,12232780," is bigger than amount of agents we have"
12232780,12235980," right so if i add this simple check"
12235980,12238540," this is not gonna simply compile"
12239900,12241820," uh wait what the"
12241820,12246700," expected declaration what the"
12246700,12247660," fuck do you want from me"
12247660,12251740," well"
12251740,12258460," expected declaration for dot dot dot oh static"
12258460,12264700," all right yeah there we go so selection pool is too big"
12265740,12269740," so that means we can just choose it like yeah i just forgot to add"
12269740,12273980," uh the the proper check for all of that and now"
12273980,12278460," if i try to uh train for on how the generations"
12278460,12283260," this is how fast it gets so this is 100 generation we can time that"
12283260,12287660," and now we can go probably for thousands of generations maybe for"
12289660,12295900," for two thousands of generations maybe even three thousands uh because it's so small"
12295900,12300540," right we can probably do that uh what's interesting is that"
12300540,12305020," gp simulation i wonder if they improved over time"
12305020,12312380," so this is going to be the output pin and let's see well"
12314940,12316300," they ate all of the food"
12316300,12321980," they ate all of the food at least and then they died"
12321980,12326780," so that was actually pretty cool because this is the first generation"
12326780,12328060," this was the first generation"
12328060,12339660," so but yeah so what about like uh 100 000 of the generations"
12344620,12345900," one wiggly boy"
12345900,12350780," so this is half of the generations"
12350780,12354220," like there is not enough like data"
12354220,12355900," to um"
12355900,12362220," memory what's wrong with memory we have we use a fixed amount of memory by the way"
12362220,12363980," um"
12368300,12369820," japan simulator gps simulator gp"
12369820,12375340," so this is 100 thousands generation"
12375340,12385580," it's kind of cool that they eat the whole food they ate everything"
12385580,12393420," so yeah it's very cool you want is a smaller board here you go here's a small board for you"
12394220,12401180," so uh yeah we can try to enable the training here so we don't need that stuff anymore"
12401180,12407980," uh but and i also need to add this check this check is super important because without this check you can"
12407980,12409980," quite easily sec fold yourself"
12411100,12418300," uh all right so um check um very important"
12418300,12424940," check that selection pool is less or equal than agents count there we go"
12424940,12429900," uh and i'm gonna remove these parameters because they're not really that important"
12430620,12434620," uh so uh maybe i need to amend that uh"
12434620,12441020," uh whatever i'm gonna did they already merge my pull request speed up entity look up"
12449500,12455580," all right let's push that into the return how about regenerate some amount of food on each step why"
12455580,12465500," i mean the code is open source uh you can just grab the code and add it yourself if you want to"
12465500,12470940," if you want to that much i'm totally okay with that it's under mit so that means you can do whatever"
12470940,12479500," you want with it uh all right so yeah thank you free food by the way for suggesting to uh check on the"
12479500,12484460," smaller boards because otherwise i wouldn't be able to find that bug and that was actually a pretty"
12484460,12493900," important bug yeah so we want to keep uh all of the invariants clean all right uh"
12494700,12501820," two two two two two and let's delete branch did it show couldn't delete branch for a second what the"
12501820,12509260," fuck fucking web shit um um classic classic web shit"
12509260,12522380," all right master let's remove that all right uh what else do we have boys and girls what else do we have um"
12524700,12533580," to the turn i'm gonna go to the project we're gonna go to the project excuse me and i'm gonna"
12533580,12541820," declare this thing done uh yep so in the mechanism so the next issue that i wanted to work on is the"
12541820,12549100," mechanism for pausing and reviews uh resuming the training so essentially right now if you try uh start"
12549100,12558620," the training you cannot stop it and check the current generation you can simply do that uh because uh it"
12558620,12569100," only dumps the result when it's uh done training right so it only then dumps the result uh so let me do a make"
12572060,12588780," um gp simulator and uh let's say 100 and output pin uh trainer there we go so um this is really"
12588780,12596540," inconvenient um it's kind of cool but also kind of inconvenient um maybe there should be some sort of a"
12596540,12603820," flag that enables gnu plot yes there should be some sort of a flag right that so by default there is no"
12603820,12608860," gnu plot but if you provide the flag it will show you gnu plot because sometimes i don't want to look"
12608860,12617260," at it yet i just testing things and this is kind of annoying so yeah and right now my point is i cannot"
12617260,12622620," control c and look at the current generation and i can't consider at all because gnu plot actually steals"
12622620,12627740," the focus completely so yeah we need a way to disable gnu plot completely it's kind of annoying it's"
12627740,12643500," unusable um all right so um let me put a note here um put uh gnu plot functionality of a gp trainer"
12644220,12650940," under a flag right under a flag right under a flag uh so yeah"
12650940,12659020," cool now um i really want to make a small break boys and girls i really want to make a small break"
12659020,12666300," uh a small break uh three minutes and after three minutes we're gonna work a little bit on that"
12672940,12686780," so um all right let's make a small break and you guys have fun"
12701660,12715500," so um"
12715500,12729500," so"
12729500,12743340," so"
12743340,12743340," so"
12743340,12745340," so"
12745340,12749340," so"
12749340,12753340," so"
12753340,12767180," so"
12767180,12769180," so"
12769180,12773180," so"
12773180,12773180," so"
12773180,12777180," so"
12777180,12779180," so"
12779180,12805020," so"
12805020,12830860," so"
12830860,12844700," uh"
12844700,12844700," so"
12844700,12844700," yo"
12844700,12844700," what's up"
12844700,12846700," what's up"
12846700,12846700," what's up dank people how's it going"
12846700,12848700," how's it going"
12848700,12854700," um all right so what we're going to do here i really want to fix that thing like uh i want"
12854700,12859340," new plot stuff to be disabled by default and only enabled by a flag"
12859340,12866540," yeah because it it steals the output it's kind of annoying but sometimes it's kind of interesting"
12866540,12871580," to look at the statistics so this is why i want to uh just work on it right now and we're going to"
12871580,12878540," simply put it under the uh under the flag shouldn't be that difficult so uh it's it's a trainer let's"
12878540,12885660," let's take a look at the trainer uh yeah so what we're doing here is this is the usage generation count"
12885660,12888620," uh output bin um"
12888620,12895820," to be fair we can make like a generation count uh like where you default to something and output"
12895820,12900380," bin also default to something and we can have like flags um"
12900380,12910140," something like uh options and uh then we're going to have different kinds of options uh the first"
12910140,12927740," option is going to be um generations generations um or g number right um amount of generations"
12929580,12930700," amount of generations"
12930700,12945820," default is 69 there we go uh then we're going to have output or simply oh uh file path you can put it"
12945820,12958780," like that uh output output uh file path default output pin there we go and"
12958780,12963500," and then we're gonna have a special flag called gnu plot"
12963500,12976540," enable epic gnu plot reporting requires gnu plot"
12976540,12984620," yeah so this is going to be the thing um"
12986860,12991820," cool cool so now uh i'm gonna move the generation count here"
12991820,12998860," and uh generations count and it has to be a 69 by default then we're also going to have const char"
12998860,13003100," output file path and by default is also going to be output dot pin"
13003100,13006620," uh all right i'm going to organize the loop that parses the flags"
13006620,13014140," or maybe not yeah because i don't have a gnu plot installed in my machine by the way so that means it doesn't"
13014140,13014940," require gnu plot"
13014940,13019180," i don't know"
13019180,13024300," um so yeah"
13024300,13037500," and essentially how we're gonna work uh with all of that um how we're gonna work with all of that"
13040620,13048060," while uh rgc uh greater than zero we're gonna do the following thing we're gonna do uh shift"
13048060,13056940," rgc rgv and uh we're gonna get the flag so here's the flag it's a const char flag"
13057900,13065420," uh and we're gonna simply do the following thing if strcmp flag"
13065420,13074460," uh generations you know what let's actually you know all of these you know big flags let's actually"
13074460,13081740," leave only small flags uh and this one is gonna be gp we're gonna plot uh because i don't want to type"
13081740,13088780," this uh type this out who uses big flags anyway um yeah"
13088780,13099020," i mean d uses a lot of like dynamic automatically stretchable arrays so i'm i would assume that's"
13099020,13105100," kind of difficult to buffer overflow there uh but i mean probably i don't know it depends on how"
13105100,13115820," how we program in d so uh yeah if it's equal to zero that means um if uh rgc equal to zero"
13115820,13126940," uh we'll have to do usage and then fprintf um usage std error by the way st error error"
13128380,13140220," uh no value provided for flag uh for flag s uh and we know the value of the flag there we go so if the"
13140220,13149660," value was provided uh we're gonna assign generations count equal a to i uh yeah we'll have to do something"
13149660,13161420," like const char where you shift or just see there we go okay so we handled the first flag so this is minus"
13161420,13177660," g flag uh cool otherwise stir cmp flag o equals zero um so we also wanna do a very similar thing here but"
13177660,13180620," instead we're also gonna set output file path"
13180620,13188940," to the value uh and the last one we want to check gp uh so we're gonna some do something like this use"
13188940,13197260," like gnu plot right it's gonna be automatically by default zero uh but if you provide this flag uh it will"
13197260,13208700," become true um so strcmp flag"
13208700,13212700," zero"
13212700,13218940," hello nutrix live welcome to the stream"
13221020,13225500," um okay so in this case we don't even have to get that value so i can just set"
13225500,13232780," uh gnu plot to one there we go so this this is the whole like flag parsing situation um this is the"
13232780,13238140," whole flag parsing situation and we can remove this part it's not needed anymore uh"
13240220,13246540," we can remove this part and then we're opening that log and apparently yeah so"
13246540,13255340," it does generate this log so what i'm gonna do here is ignore that log so we have to do log"
13258620,13265180," the problem the problem is only the log live update function i don't know gnu plot i'm sorry um"
13265180,13268380," okay"
13275820,13276940," so if"
13276940,13284860," gnu plot we're gonna initialize that log and stuff like that"
13284860,13294300," all right so we'll have to do"
13294300,13302220," you forgot about the break oh yeah thank you thank you so much thank you thank you thank you"
13302220,13309980," um"
13309980,13322060," okay okay okay okay uh and i think we'll have to do it like that so by default is going to be a"
13322060,13330060," null pointer all right then it's going to be like this if gnu plot"
13331900,13337900," like this like this um we'll open the log log header"
13337900,13348860," log generation"
13348860,13357020," where do we start the gnu plot by the way so it's actually logging"
13358620,13365980," um what so log header yeah okay log header is you wouldn't kind of expect"
13365980,13376780," the like starting gnu plot in the log header to be fair like why does it start"
13376780,13381580," because log generation doesn't start anything i would expect all this function to just"
13382540,13386700," um look something um look something so it's kind of weird but"
13386700,13389180," okay"
13389180,13391660," uh"
13391660,13396060," yeah i should have actually reviewed that a little bit better"
13396060,13399100," all right i'm gonna refactor it anyway at some point"
13399100,13408460," all right so uh flash outlook generation log life update okay so this is another thing that we"
13408460,13409180," will want to do here"
13409180,13419900," so that's why you should be super careful and don't get too excited"
13422220,13434620," uh okay so this is essentially initialization this is actual logging and this is de-initialization okay i"
13434620,13442780," think it makes sense all right so does it compile um does it compile it seems to be compiling them"
13443740,13446620," okay okay a gp trainer um let's actually try to run it"
13446620,13452540," it actually runs it and it's doing things right and if i try to do gp"
13452540,13460460," uh no value provided for flag yes okay so and also i forgot a very important thing here"
13460460,13465100," i also forgot a very important thing um"
13466380,13474940," okay so and i don't have to do this that's for sure because it's just a flag it doesn't have a parameter"
13474940,13485420," i don't with your blog game check out the schedule check out if iq check out everything you are new"
13486460,13494220," you have no idea what is going on all right so if i try to do this kind of thing it actually shows me"
13494220,13501180," this kind of stuff all right that's cool uh so but if i do that without this thing it doesn't do"
13501180,13507420," the gnu plot so i can uh you know have uh gnu plot on demand"
13507420,13514620," uh you do have ma well i mean i answered the question um so"
13522220,13532300," to to to to to to to to we need to help yes we need help uh"
13532300,13542700," so this is going to be something like uh print uh this help"
13542700,13551740," uh print this help and we're going to have a similar situation here uh else if strcmp"
13551740,13552380," you flag"
13552380,13562940," uh we essentially do um usage std out and then we exit with zero"
13562940,13568540," so at any point uh you can do a gp trainer"
13568540,13575340," and it didn't work because i didn't recompile it oh and also i think we also need to print um"
13576460,13578620," you know the following thing usage std error"
13578620,13581420," that print f std error"
13581420,13589100," unknown flag is provided like that unknown flag flag"
13589980,13596380," um okay unknown flag and then exit with one so if you try to provide something that is unknown"
13596380,13599100," uh you're gonna get spanked"
13599100,13608300," very very hard look at that unknown flag this thing so and then you can do h and it prints me this thing and"
13608300,13621820," then i'm gonna do uh gp i suppose and that gives me a gp cool nice nice nice nice nice so this is my changes so now"
13622780,13628380," uh yeah that's pretty cool"
13628380,13637020," uh"
13637020,13648140," let's do a committee committee and why this is not get ignored because it's not log it's that it's that log"
13649500,13659660," look it's it's that log"
13659660,13662060," sorry"
13662060,13666060," all right"
13666060,13672940," let's continue"
13674700,13677420," did it actually getting okay so it actually get ignored it"
13677420,13683980," uh cool i think i need to create a separate branch and uh who cares"
13683980,13696220," uh put gnu plot functionality of a gp trainer uh under a flag"
13696220,13700620," that's basically what we're gonna have here i'm gonna push that right into the repo"
13703900,13719340," no mod found yeah i'm a trash developer i'm sorry i'm a trash developer"
13719340,13728460," uh don't get me wrong but why are you not using get opt uv because i already asked for that like a"
13728460,13733100," couple of seconds ago i'm a trash developer so uh yep"
13733100,13748300," pause and resume uh mechanisms for gp trainer okay so let's give it a try so essentially what we want"
13748300,13757340," to do here we want to be able to uh catch control c uh catch control c and if we're catching control c we"
13757340,13766620," want to actually dump the current state uh how can i deploy your trash on my awsk it's uh kates is"
13766620,13771740," that what's called kates cluster uh i don't know i never use them so"
13783660,13790540," so let's actually quickly implement that i suppose uh i just pulled buzzwords out of my ass don't don't"
13790540,13800060," worry oh i see that makes sense so does anybody remember how to can uh handle control c i remember"
13800060,13804300," you should not supposed to use signal because it's not portable or something because that's what he was"
13804300,13813900," impulse told me uh yeah for to be i don't remember okay so maybe that's what we have to do so we assign a"
13813900,13817660," signal we're going to put a sig in there and this is going to be our signal handler"
13817660,13827580," so let's give it a try i have a cool idea chat i have a cool idea i'm gonna go to uh gp trainer this is"
13827580,13828780," okay so it's going to be four"
13828780,13838300," uh you use some package from creator i think it's called control c i think it's control c it was it was"
13838300,13850860," yeah this one i wonder if there is control z though"
13850860,13859500," uh control z now there's no control z on the control c that's the only key combination you can handle i'm"
13859500,13862300," sorry we didn't implement other key combinations"
13862300,13868300," anyway so"
13868300,13881740," man signal"
13885020,13888300," so that's what we have to call so this is signal handler is just that"
13888300,13897420," um so we're gonna literally call it control c because why not uh and it accepts uh integer that"
13897420,13903580," we probably won't ignore uh maybe it's signum and you know what we're going to print when"
13903580,13908460," like user pre uh presses control c we're going to print debate it"
13909420,13918940," i'm going to debate it then we're going to set signal sig int uh control c there we go and i think"
13918940,13923740," we also need to import this kind of stuff so this doesn't work on windows anymore by the way"
13923740,13931740," with this simple change it doesn't work on windows nice i love it"
13935420,13937420," imagine using printfnc yeah i know"
13937420,13942940," oh wait it worked"
13942940,13951820," it worked the second time what the why did it work the second time does anybody know"
13961420,13966380," that's very interesting"
13966380,13973500," maybe we don't really need to you need to call signal again in the handler i think so it's it's"
13973500,13981900," consumable so because the signal handler returns so what"
13984300,13984860," uh"
13984860,13992620," a lot of functions return you have to do exit syscall yourself to exit"
13992620,13995660," but it does exit"
13995660,14006860," it exits so the question is not like i don't understand i'm sorry i think i i'm done but"
14007500,14008300," let's give it a try"
14008300,14018460," all right it is consumable why is it consumable"
14018460,14026780," why is it consumable"
14031820,14038700," that's very strange"
14038700,14045980," yeah here's a plus my goal was not to exit and control c by the way my goal was not to exit"
14045980,14051340," imagine if a gdb couldn't consume sig int"
14056700,14061820," it's too much brain but i don't understand could you please give like a more explicit example i'm"
14061820,14069420," really sorry i'm streaming and my like you need to say this thing directly to me if i need to make"
14069420,14074460," like a lot of logical steps i don't understand it wouldn't be able to break the program why"
14078780,14084300," um i'm really apologize for being done but that's just the consequence of me streaming so uh anyway"
14084300,14089340," ah all right so"
14089340,14092540," um okay cool"
14092540,14099900," so what i wanted to do here is uh"
14104060,14106780," yeah but i don't want to exit so yeah so"
14106780,14114060," my question was not about why it doesn't exit my question was why it's consumable so it's but i"
14114060,14114780," understand now"
14114780,14122060," to be fair i'm already streaming for four hours and i'm extremely tired"
14122060,14130140," so um yeah probably gonna wrap up uh and the problem here i don't know what to do with this series"
14130780,14136940," because uh there's still a lot of interesting things that i want to do"
14136940,14142940," uh but do i want to turn it into like a project that i want to work every week or something"
14142940,14145740," i kind of already explored genetic programming"
14145740,14154620," i kind of originally okay i see uh i can explore genetic programming so the rest of the stuff that i"
14154620,14160540," want to do for this project is just speed it up uh and maybe try other things but i got the gist of"
14160540,14167020," genetics so i pretty much got everything i wanted out of this project so i am not sure what to do with"
14167020,14176780," it so yeah that was very interesting um am i going to turn it into like a continuous project"
14176780,14182780," it was pretty epic mini series though yeah it was actually pretty cool i really enjoyed it um"
14184380,14191340," it would be interesting to use it as an opportunity to learn open cl and open mp i mean learn open mp i"
14191340,14195180," used open mp but i used it like seven years ago so"
14195180,14203660," it's kind of funny that i've been programming for so long i have technologies that i have to relearn"
14203660,14208380," because i use them i use them successfully in commercial project and then i didn't use"
14208380,14214700," them for a long time and i don't remember how to use them so i have to relearn them so uh programming"
14214700,14219260," is infinite learning for me not because there's so many technologies but because i have to constantly"
14219260,14225740," relearn them because i keep forgetting them i tried too much yet so it's kind of funny"
14227260,14235260," uh yeah so maybe on one of the uh when i will need an opportunity to learn open cl"
14235260,14242140," or relearn open mp i may get back to this project at some point um"
14245260,14251580," i really enjoy the examples of genesis program where you have agents that try to accomplish"
14251580,14258060," something like pathfinding to a goal it's actually interesting is it bug free depends on the definition"
14258060,14267260," of a bug um if you define bug as unexpected behavior so far i didn't really find any unexpected behaviors"
14268860,14275740," um so all right i guess that's it for today boys and girls uh i guess this is going to be the last"
14275740,14280300," episode in this series maybe at some point we're going to get back to it so i'm going to just keep"
14280300,14287820," this project in mind as we move forward and yeah and i see you guess when i see you guess when i'm"
14287820,14294700," gonna see you all tomorrow tomorrow we're gonna do an epic c plus plus game development how about that"
14295820,14302380," an epic c plus plus game development uh so also check out our schedule page for more information"
14302380,14309100," on different projects we're working on also check out our discord yes check out our discord check out"
14309100,14317420," our what's youtube channel where we archive these words from twitch on the next day uh so you can watch"
14317420,14324700," them on youtube because they're uh pretty convenient to watch there and i guess that's it i guess that's it"
14324700,14331100," today was a very interesting stream i really enjoyed it thanks everyone thanks everyone and i see you all"
14331100,14334140," tomorrow love you"
