600000,629980," Thank you."
629980,659960," Thank you."
659960,689940," Thank you."
689960,719940," That will be a pretty good topic to stream."
719940,749920," Thank you."
749940,779920," In the form of a scientific paper."
779940,809920," Thank you."
809940,839920," Thank you."
839920,869900," Thank you."
869920,899900," So, what I was saying, so we're going to implement this library today on the stream."
899900,929880," Because nobody is going to do it, because nobody is going to show you."
929880,959860," Thank you."
959860,989840," I don't know."
989840,1019820," And we're going to do it, but we're going to do it, but we're going to do it."
1019820,1049800," I think we're going to do it, but we're going to do it."
1049800,1079780," We're going to do it, we're going to do it, but we're going to do it."
1079780,1109760," We're going to do it, but we're going to do it."
1109760,1118680," Today we are developing a super fast lightweight in the camel called Parcum."
1118680,1123160," Become Parcumer today."
1123160,1127580," So check the source code."
1127580,1131300," HTTPS GitHub.com."
1131300,1133520," It says in Parcum."
1133520,1135280," All right."
1135280,1136580," Become Parcum."
1137840,1149400," So maybe it also makes sense to put that in the title."
1149400,1151220," So I'm going to update the title."
1151220,1153420," Super quick."
1153420,1157240," So there we go."
1157240,1158280," All right."
1158280,1160580," So what's going to be the next step?"
1160580,1163360," The next step is going to be actually cloning this entire stuff."
1165920,1167920," And starting developing this thing."
1167920,1173500," All right."
1173500,1174280," Parcum."
1174280,1179300," I suppose this library is..."
1179300,1181740," I suppose this library is better because it doesn't exist."
1181740,1182980," Yeah, exactly."
1182980,1184500," That's exactly why it's so fast."
1184500,1186620," All right."
1186660,1189420," So I'm going to create an SSC folder."
1189420,1195020," And I think I'm going to also start Emacs from within the development environment."
1195020,1197160," But first we need to set up the development environment."
1197160,1198560," There's such thing called opam."
1198560,1200660," I'm not sure if I already showed that."
1200660,1207940," But opam is essentially a package manager and also a compiler version manager."
1208620,1211120," Parcum community library from scratch very epic."
1211120,1211960," Yes, it is."
1211960,1214980," So, you know, camel as well."
1214980,1217420," So camel is a pretty epic language."
1217420,1220840," I kind of like a camel a little bit more than Haskell."
1220840,1222620," I also like programming Haskell."
1222620,1226080," But I like a camel a little bit more because it's a little bit more programmatic."
1226080,1227660," Pokecam."
1228040,1231780," So I'm using opam, which is..."
1231780,1237120," You can think of an opam like a combination of npm and nvm, right?"
1237120,1243200," In JavaScript world, npm is a package manager and nvm is like a node version manager."
1243200,1248020," So basically in a camel world, we have a single tool for both of these things."
1248020,1253300," So and it can manage several versions of the compiler."
1254020,1260720," And, for example, if you want to set up the environment where a specific version of OCaml is available for you,"
1260720,1262640," you have to do opam environment."
1262640,1269500," And it gives you like a bash script that sets up environment variables and stuff like that."
1269500,1274500," And you just essentially take it and evaluate it in your environment."
1274500,1275460," And there you go."
1275460,1282080," If you take a look at the OCaml compiler, it's pointing to something that is installed in my home folder."
1282800,1285360," So you don't really have to do that manually."
1285360,1288300," You can just put that into your bash.rc."
1288300,1298160," But I prefer to do that manually just to stay aware of how environment is set up and where the executables come from."
1298160,1301420," I'm not sure if it makes sense, but for some reason, it's really important for me."
1301420,1303540," Otherwise, I forget how my system works."
1303540,1306540," So for me, it's really important to be aware of such small things."
1307180,1311900," And that's one of the reasons why I don't use Rust app for setting up Rust versions."
1311900,1315500," I just like to install them myself because I always need to be aware of the environment."
1315500,1317220," Otherwise, I forget how things work."
1317220,1318660," It's really weird."
1318660,1320220," I'm sorry, but I'm a weird individual."
1320220,1321440," Anyway."
1322620,1324900," So let's start Emacs."
1324900,1330260," And let's create parkoom.ml."
1330260,1331140," And there we go."
1331140,1336960," Here is the fresh canvas, like a blank canvas where we can do anything."
1337800,1342800," So this is where we're going to start painting our beautiful, beautiful library."
1342800,1345740," Alias, nixshell."
1345740,1346140," Yes."
1346140,1348580," So basically, I do remember that."
1348580,1351140," ML is as in machine learning."
1351140,1352960," No, ML is like in HTML."
1352960,1353900," Yes."
1353900,1358720," Hello, DROKAM87."
1358720,1362960," And HTML stands for hypertext machine learning."
1363800,1371560," So maybe we should actually put something in readme, parser commutator library."
1371560,1375380," I think I'm going to actually put whatever we have here."
1375380,1379420," Super fast and let's play it, parser commutator in the camel."
1379420,1381880," This is going to be the actual description."
1381880,1385460," I'm not sure if it copy pasted it properly."
1385460,1387260," So let me try to do that one more time there."
1387260,1387900," But go."
1390800,1393640," No dependencies, no dependencies."
1393640,1405680," You can just copy, paste, copy, paste it to your project, project and use it."
1405680,1407560," That's how lightweight I want it to be."
1407560,1408480," Right."
1408480,1413220," So no package managers, no dependencies or anything like that."
1413220,1415000," You just have a single file of the library."
1415000,1417300," Just copy, paste it to your project and just fucking use it."
1417340,1418860," And you have parser commutators."
1418860,1420080," Very fucking epic."
1420080,1423140," So yeah, that's going to be the final."
1423140,1428500," Needs more buzzwords, to be honest."
1428500,1429980," I don't know."
1429980,1430940," I think it's okay."
1430940,1432360," To be fair."
1432360,1436560," If you have any suggestions on more buzzwords, you can submit a podcast, I suppose."
1438500,1439160," Hello, Xiang."
1439160,1439920," Welcome to the stream."
1439920,1441800," Did you click that?"
1441800,1444500," Hello, hello."
1444500,1447460," Welcome to the stream."
1447460,1448300," Welcome, welcome, welcome."
1448300,1451380," So my git fucking broke."
1451380,1453920," I don't understand why."
1453920,1455120," Okay, let me just start emacs."
1455120,1456840," Let me just start emacs."
1459040,1460580," You need to add monos to the redmi."
1460580,1463380," Supervised parser combinator library."
1463380,1465740," Let's actually put monadic."
1465740,1467420," Monadic parser combinator library."
1467420,1469000," Yes, I did."
1469000,1470840," I'm really glad that you liked it."
1470840,1475200," All right."
1475200,1480300," So add more details to the redmi."
1480300,1483320," Let's push that right into the repo."
1484320,1489440," Will there be a whitepaper?"
1489440,1495120," I don't really plan to write any whitepaper, because there's already whitepaper on monadic parser combinators."
1495120,1498500," So you can just read this one, right?"
1498500,1502220," Let me just copy-paste it."
1502220,1508860," And also, you can watch my video on JSON parsing in Haskell, where I also reinvented monadic parser combinators."
1508860,1510340," So, yeah."
1510340,1513080," I might as well actually add this thing to the references."
1513080,1514080," Yeah."
1514320,1516180," So, we're going to have a section of references."
1516180,1517320," References."
1517320,1518480," And this is going to be one of them."
1518480,1519240," Here we go."
1519240,1528600," Add references to redmi."
1528600,1531000," I'm going to push that right into the repo."
1531000,1533320," Now."
1533320,1537220," By the way, Xiang, I'm automatically using main."
1538600,1539840," Because I think, yeah."
1539840,1543320," Git automatically just, you know, forced me to use this branch."
1543320,1544900," And I'm actually okay with that, to be fair."
1544900,1546420," Like, I don't really care about it too much."
1546420,1548340," So, par-cum."
1548340,1550400," Did I?"
1550400,1552100," I think I didn't create a file."
1552100,1553280," I don't know how that happened."
1553280,1554020," But there we go."
1554020,1555020," Par-cum.ml."
1555880,1558720," So, what is a parser combinator?"
1558720,1562740," Well, let's think about what is a parser, right?"
1562740,1570220," It's a function that accepts some sort of input and returns something that it parses, right?"
1570260,1573100," You want to parse an integer, right?"
1573100,1575140," So, you're going to have a function."
1575140,1577500," By the way, there is such a thing called utop."
1577500,1581000," It's kind of similar to GHCI for Haskell, but it's for a camel."
1581000,1587440," And it's actually way more epic than GHCI because it has a lot of pretty colors and ASCII art and stuff like that."
1587440,1591600," And it auto-completes things, right?"
1591600,1593020," And you can also check stuff here."
1593020,1596220," By the way, it's going to be mostly looking at 75 out of that."
1596220,1597260," Okay, I believe in you, Xiang."
1597260,1597900," You can do that."
1597980,1602960," You can get all of the 11 of them and you will pass exam, you know, with a straight A's."
1602960,1603940," So, I believe in you."
1603940,1605520," Okay."
1605520,1612940," So, we're going to use utop for, you know, experimenting with the camel stuff and stuff like that."
1612940,1614460," Okay."
1614460,1617460," So, for example, you have a function int of a string."
1617460,1619280," And this is a pretty straightforward function."
1619280,1623940," It just takes a string, which is an input, and returns you an integer, right?"
1624620,1629840," But, again, so, your parsing process may fail, right?"
1629840,1631860," Your parsing process may fail."
1631860,1634620," And in case of it, int of string, right?"
1634620,1638100," And so, if you have something like 69, it will work correctly."
1638100,1643240," But if you have something like parkum, it's going to throw an exception."
1643480,1645580," So, in our case, we don't really want to throw an exception."
1645580,1649440," We want to kind of, like, fail a little bit more gracefully."
1649440,1653340," So, because of that, we're going to return a result, right?"
1655100,1656920," So, we're going to return a result."
1656920,1662340," And result is a special type in a camel, if I remember correctly."
1662340,1667380," It's kind of similar to result in, what is this called?"
1667380,1668640," What is this zoomer language called?"
1668640,1669000," Rust."
1669000,1671320," Yes, I forgot about the name of that zoomer language."
1671320,1675180," So, a camel result."
1675180,1676520," Let's find out."
1678700,1680860," I keep forgetting about zoomer languages, I'm sorry."
1680860,1684960," So, it even looks like a, you know, type from a camel."
1684960,1688740," So, it has a version of a K, which returns a value, and version of error."
1688740,1690980," So, this is what we're going to be using here."
1690980,1693860," So, a parser is essentially a function from the input"
1693860,1698440," and a result that may either return what you expected."
1698440,1700480," This is, by the way, a polymorphic parameter."
1700480,1702800," Or, it may return an error."
1702800,1705660," But, that is not it, actually."
1705660,1707180," If you think about that."
1707180,1712180," What if you want to parse, like, a sequence of numbers?"
1712180,1713260," Right."
1713260,1716380," So, you have, like, ten numbers as a string."
1716380,1718140," Something like this."
1718140,1719300," One, two, three, four, five."
1719300,1721900," And, you need a function that, you know,"
1721900,1724780," you have a function that parses only one number."
1724780,1727680," And, you want to use that function continuously"
1727680,1729280," to parse all of these numbers."
1729840,1734040," So, that means, this particular function"
1734040,1737500," should return not only the result,"
1737500,1738960," but also,"
1738960,1741900," but also,"
1741900,1743980," the rest of the input."
1743980,1747240," So, essentially, it consumes a little bit of input,"
1747240,1749640," then, returns you either an error"
1749640,1752660," or a result plus the rest of the input."
1753040,1756820," So, you can then reuse the same function"
1756820,1758320," to parse more and more and more."
1758320,1759620," So, as you can see,"
1759620,1761240," the more you think about"
1761240,1763820," what is a function that parses an input,"
1763820,1765600," the more complex it becomes."
1765600,1766380," Right."
1766380,1767860," So, it becomes more and more complex."
1767860,1770040," You add more and more features into this function."
1770040,1771840," And, it becomes kind of difficult"
1771840,1773360," to compose these functions together."
1773360,1774080," Right."
1774240,1775100," So, for example,"
1775100,1776880," like, how can I call this function"
1776880,1778480," continuously parsing numbers?"
1778480,1780520," Well, you'll have to constantly check for errors."
1780520,1781760," You will have to constantly, like,"
1781760,1783840," keep track of the rest of the input"
1783840,1784840," and so on and so forth."
1784840,1785880," It's kind of,"
1785880,1787920," it's kind of frustrating."
1787920,1790920," And, this is where the parser combinations come in."
1790920,1791900," So, essentially,"
1791900,1797460," they take this entire syntactic noise"
1797460,1800040," and shove it under a single abstraction."
1800040,1802580," So, now, we're going to call this entire thing a parser."
1802920,1804560," So, and this is going to be a structure."
1804560,1807140," And, we're going to keep this function"
1807140,1808500," inside of this structure."
1808500,1809020," There you go."
1809020,1812060," So, a parser is just something"
1812060,1813640," that wraps around this function."
1813640,1814620," Right."
1814620,1818040," So, and every time you come up with a new parser,"
1818040,1820700," you will be able to compose them together"
1820700,1821680," with different operations"
1821680,1823800," that automatically resolve all of the problems."
1823800,1825540," They automatically take care about errors."
1825540,1827280," They automatically take care about"
1827280,1828400," keeping track of the input"
1828400,1829480," and so on and so forth."
1829480,1831700," So, this is basically what parser communities are."
1832060,1833860," This is like the simplest definition"
1833860,1834780," of a parser community."
1834780,1835360," Make sense?"
1835360,1838440," Probably makes sense."
1838440,1839400," And, for more information,"
1839400,1841060," you can also read the paper"
1841060,1843480," or watch my, you know,"
1843480,1845020," JSON video and stuff like that."
1845020,1846480," So, and we're going to just"
1846480,1848080," implement a bunch of operations"
1848080,1849120," for this particular,"
1849120,1850980," for this particular type."
1850980,1853800," So, the thing here is that"
1853800,1855320," we have two things"
1855320,1856680," that are not particularly defined."
1856800,1858320," we have input and error."
1858320,1861340," So, we may try to say"
1861340,1863060," that input is just a string."
1863060,1867280," A camel's like husky with cheese."
1867280,1868700," Yeah, it kind of feels like it."
1868700,1870180," But it's actually kind of great"
1870180,1872840," because it makes it extremely pragmatic."
1872840,1874400," Because sometimes,"
1874400,1876680," like, it's kind of difficult"
1876680,1877980," and not practical"
1877980,1879400," to make everything pure."
1880040,1882040," and for some simple task,"
1882040,1882860," you just want to, like,"
1882860,1884500," write a couple of nested for loops."
1884500,1886120," And a camel just allows you to do that."
1886120,1887200," It's just, you know,"
1887200,1888240," you want to write it, like,"
1888240,1889040," a nested for loop,"
1889040,1890420," just go ahead and write it."
1890420,1892260," So, nobody's going to notice that."
1892260,1894620," So, and it fits perfectly"
1894620,1895480," into the whole, like,"
1895480,1896960," syntactical and semantical model"
1896960,1897420," of a camel."
1897420,1898220," It's just fucking beautiful."
1898220,1898920," I love it."
1900700,1916180," Well, we have a command for voidf,"
1916180,1917500," if you guys forgot."
1917500,1919380," So."
1919380,1924140," So, but I don't really like this thing"
1924140,1925660," because I also want to keep track"
1925660,1926560," of the position"
1926560,1929180," of how much we parsed, right?"
1929240,1931220," because if the error happens,"
1931220,1932260," I want to know"
1932260,1933620," where exactly it happens"
1933620,1934940," and if we stopped parsing,"
1934940,1935860," I want to know"
1935860,1937460," where exactly we stopped parsing."
1937460,1938860," So, basically,"
1938860,1940980," I want to make an input a wrapper."
1940980,1942400," So, it's going to have"
1942400,1944140," a string as a text,"
1944140,1945400," but on top of that,"
1945400,1946120," it also has,"
1946120,1947200," it's going to have a position"
1947200,1947840," as an integer."
1947840,1948940," All right."
1948940,1950640," So, and if you're going to do"
1950640,1951760," any operations on an input,"
1951760,1952680," you have to keep track"
1952680,1953360," of this position"
1953360,1955260," and then you can use this position"
1955260,1957660," to locate where exactly you are."
1958940,1959280," Okay."
1959280,1962840," So, let's also define"
1962840,1964700," an error, error type."
1964700,1968100," So, an error is going to have"
1968100,1968720," a description"
1968720,1970660," saying what exactly has happened"
1970660,1972220," and also a position"
1972220,1973540," where exactly that happened."
1973540,1974140," And there you go."
1974140,1976060," So, we have like two important things,"
1976060,1977340," input, an error"
1977340,1978300," and a parser"
1978300,1979300," that uses both of them."
1979300,1981560," So, on top of that,"
1981560,1983020," I think it would be kind of cool"
1983020,1983880," to have a function"
1983880,1984900," that would let you"
1984900,1986140," make an input"
1986140,1987360," out of any string"
1987360,1988800," so you would accept"
1988800,1989380," a string"
1989380,1991380," and you will get an input"
1991380,1992420," so you don't have to"
1992420,1993200," like use"
1993200,1994480," a lot of syntactical noise."
1994480,1996380," Just something like this."
1996380,1997080," S"
1997080,1997780," and position"
1997780,1998860," is going to be initially"
1998860,2000080," I think you have to do"
2000080,2000620," like equal"
2000620,2001660," if I remember correctly"
2001660,2002480," and also have to do"
2002480,2002960," semicolon."
2002960,2004140," There we go."
2004140,2005480," So, if you have a string,"
2005480,2006040," you will be able"
2006040,2006920," to easily turn it"
2006920,2007540," into an input"
2007540,2008240," and then pipe it"
2008240,2009020," into the parser."
2009020,2010520," So, something like that."
2010520,2012900," Alright."
2012900,2016160," So, that's the two important things"
2016160,2017080," I want to have"
2017080,2017960," I suppose."
2017960,2021420," Should error position"
2021420,2022520," be int int"
2022520,2024580," for line and call?"
2024580,2026280," I don't think so."
2026280,2027480," I think I want to actually"
2027480,2029240," keep track of the position"
2029240,2030080," in absolute"
2030080,2032400," like in characters"
2032400,2033940," because then later"
2033940,2034900," you can convert it"
2034900,2037200," to lines and columns yourself."
2037200,2037820," Right."
2037820,2038540," Maybe you don't want"
2038540,2040200," to use lines and columns."
2040200,2041400," Maybe you want to"
2041400,2042700," somehow address them"
2042700,2043260," differently."
2043260,2044540," So, we're going to"
2044540,2045880," store the position"
2045880,2046580," universally."
2046580,2047740," It's the character."
2047740,2048640," And then we're going"
2048640,2049500," to have separate function"
2049500,2050780," that can turn it"
2050780,2051580," into line and column"
2051580,2052460," based on the input."
2052460,2053660," Does it make sense?"
2053660,2059520," So, is the void"
2059520,2060640," of command a counter?"
2060640,2061420," Yes, it is a counter."
2064900,2067000," Hello, should run."
2067000,2067680," Welcome to a stream."
2067680,2072660," So, I think it would"
2072660,2073640," make sense to"
2073640,2076240," also have an example"
2076240,2078980," that uses this library"
2078980,2081200," somehow."
2081200,2082620," Otherwise, it doesn't"
2082620,2083540," really make much sense."
2083540,2084260," So, we need to come up"
2084260,2084720," with something"
2084720,2087000," that will parse"
2087000,2089520," things with this"
2089520,2090500," parser combinator library."
2091220,2093680," So, let me create"
2093680,2094860," something like examples."
2094860,2096300," So, in examples,"
2096300,2098100," let's create"
2098100,2099000," config parser."
2099000,2099440," Right."
2099440,2099960," So, it's going to be"
2099960,2100520," config.ml."
2100520,2102800," And we're going to"
2102800,2103760," try to parse"
2103760,2105540," a particular config"
2105540,2105940," format."
2105940,2107920," So,"
2107920,2110140," test,"
2110140,2111580," test.conf."
2111580,2113440," So, it's going to be"
2113440,2114160," very, like,"
2114160,2115800," a common config format."
2116640,2117220," essentially,"
2117220,2117860," it's going to have"
2117860,2118260," comments."
2118260,2120280," Comments like this."
2120280,2121820," Then, it's going to have"
2121820,2123600," a key value"
2123600,2124840," like this"
2124840,2125520," and comments"
2125520,2126540," like this."
2126540,2128260," So, this is going to be"
2128260,2129340," comment 2."
2129340,2131260," 1, 2."
2131260,2133800," Then, it's going to have"
2133800,2134920," also empty lines"
2134920,2136760," and also, it's going to be"
2136760,2137340," like this."
2137340,2138320," Value 2."
2138320,2139700," Yeah."
2139700,2141420," So, and then"
2141420,2142780," 3,"
2142780,2145660," 4."
2146640,2147980," There we go."
2147980,2150720," So, we need to implement"
2150720,2151620," like an example"
2151620,2153020," that parses something"
2153020,2153760," like this"
2153760,2154740," using the"
2154740,2156160," parser"
2156160,2156940," combinatus library."
2156940,2159480," So, how are we"
2159480,2160120," going to do that?"
2160120,2161500," So, we're going to"
2161500,2162680," define a config"
2162680,2163720," ram."
2163720,2165080," Maybe we're going to"
2165080,2167500," oh, it already"
2167500,2168580," has a word"
2168580,2169520," parser for it."
2169520,2170660," That's really strange."
2170660,2172020," Huh."
2172020,2173040," I'm going to ignore that."
2173040,2175160," So, this thing"
2175160,2175820," is going to be"
2175820,2176880," par"
2176880,2179360," parcum"
2179360,2180380," parser."
2180380,2181740," It's kind of"
2181740,2182440," it's kind of strange."
2182440,2183360," Like in parcum"
2183360,2183880," parser"
2183880,2184880," it is not highlighted."
2184880,2186560," Yeah, it is not highlighted"
2186560,2187480," because it's a type."
2187480,2190540," How about parsing"
2190540,2191160," .ini?"
2191160,2192040," It shouldn't be"
2192040,2192980," way harder than"
2192980,2193740," current format."
2193740,2194480," We can try to do"
2194480,2195300," .ini."
2195300,2195980," Why not?"
2195980,2198520," So,"
2198900,2200940," So, this is going to be"
2200940,2201180," .ini."
2201180,2208620," So, I don't really know"
2208620,2209760," what .ini is capable of."
2209760,2210600," Does it have comments"
2210600,2211580," or anything like that?"
2212440,2213460," So, we can have"
2213460,2214660," section 1"
2214660,2216680," key 1 to 3"
2216680,2223900," section 2"
2223900,2227200," key 1 to 3"
2227200,2228880," Does it have spaces"
2228880,2229700," between these things?"
2229700,2230320," We're going to assume"
2230320,2231240," that it does have spaces"
2231240,2231540," whatever."
2231540,2231920," Whatever I'm all."
2231920,2237920," Comments are starting."
2237920,2238940," Okay, so that would be"
2238940,2239600," actually pretty cool."
2239600,2242840," But maybe I do have"
2242840,2243200," .ini."
2243380,2244240," I don't have a new mod"
2244240,2244700," unfortunately."
2244700,2247180," So, comment 1"
2247180,2248900," and then we're going to"
2248900,2249840," have something like"
2249840,2250620," comment 2"
2250620,2252400," All right."
2252400,2253320," So, this is going to be"
2253320,2253920," just a test"
2253920,2255140," to have something"
2255140,2256820," to test the library on."
2256820,2259160," And instead of"
2259160,2259720," config"
2259720,2261940," instead of config"
2261940,2264780," we're going to have"
2264780,2265900," .ini.ml"
2265900,2268180," It's going to be"
2268180,2268480," .ini"
2268480,2270580," It's going to be"
2270580,2271100," .com"
2271100,2272060," parser"
2272060,2273700," and"
2273700,2275620," let's see how"
2275620,2276200," we're going to do that."
2276200,2276820," So, right now"
2276820,2277460," it's not implemented"
2277460,2278040," so it's going to be"
2278040,2278860," just fail with"
2278860,2281280," fail with"
2281280,2281900," to do"
2281900,2283760," something like this."
2283760,2287840," Unfortunately"
2287840,2289840," I need to learn"
2289840,2290480," how to read"
2290480,2291240," the whole file"
2291240,2291860," in a camel."
2291860,2296520," As far as I can remember"
2296520,2297440," there is no"
2297440,2298660," like a separate"
2298660,2299340," function that"
2299340,2300620," reads the whole file"
2300620,2301140," in a camel."
2302060,2302320," All right."
2302320,2302980," You have to implement"
2302980,2303420," it yourself."
2303420,2305380," So, read"
2305380,2306140," whole file"
2306140,2307400," you have to provide"
2307400,2308220," the file path"
2308220,2309420," it's going to be"
2309420,2309680," a string"
2309680,2310320," and it will return"
2310320,2310940," you like the whole"
2310940,2311260," string."
2311260,2312180," So, we're going to"
2312180,2312740," implement it a little"
2312740,2313100," bit later."
2313100,2314200," All right."
2314200,2317120," So, and"
2317120,2317760," we're going to run"
2317760,2318200," the test."
2318200,2320120," So, we read"
2320120,2321160," maybe I'm going to do"
2321160,2321820," something like this"
2321820,2322260," any"
2322260,2324740," what is it"
2324740,2326140," it is a test"
2326140,2326760," in you"
2326760,2327880," it is test"
2327880,2328200," in you"
2328200,2329520," we then"
2329520,2331100," read the whole"
2331100,2331600," file"
2331600,2332780," then"
2332780,2333640," park"
2333640,2336500," read the whole"
2336500,2336880," file"
2336880,2337440," and"
2337440,2338660," we make"
2338660,2339400," an input"
2339400,2340100," out of it"
2340100,2340540," right"
2340540,2341180," we make an input"
2341180,2341680," out of it"
2341680,2342560," then we take"
2342560,2343160," any new"
2343160,2344020," parser combinator"
2344020,2344920," and we're running"
2344920,2346020," it on this"
2346020,2346820," entire thing."
2347540,2347720," right"
2347720,2348460," and that"
2348460,2349700," should give us"
2349700,2351700," the parsed"
2351700,2352440," result of a new"
2352440,2352800," yeah"
2352800,2354240," but how are we"
2354240,2354840," going to even do"
2354840,2355260," all of that"
2355260,2355780," I think we need"
2355780,2356380," separate types"
2356380,2357000," for sections"
2357000,2357720," so we're going to"
2357720,2358320," have a section"
2358320,2359560," and each"
2359560,2360560," individual section"
2360560,2363960," is essentially"
2363960,2365740," a list"
2365740,2366940," a list"
2366940,2367700," of payers"
2367700,2368180," so we're going"
2368180,2368420," to have"
2368420,2368800," payer"
2368800,2371160," what's up"
2371160,2371600," copper case"
2371600,2371720," it"
2371720,2371960," hello"
2371960,2372460," 85"
2372460,2373000," welcome"
2373000,2373300," welcome"
2373300,2373640," welcome"
2373640,2374400," and the"
2374400,2374700," payer"
2374700,2375940," is essentially"
2375940,2377860," key and value"
2377860,2378500," right"
2378500,2379480," key and value"
2379480,2381560," key is a string"
2381560,2382380," and value"
2382380,2383460," also a string"
2383460,2384960," not"
2384960,2385860," why can't I"
2385860,2386660," can't I tap"
2386660,2388180," payer"
2388180,2389700," yeah there we go"
2389700,2390620," so this is basically"
2390620,2391740," the whole model here"
2391740,2392540," so"
2392540,2393900," you have a section"
2393900,2394840," section is a list"
2394840,2395340," of payers"
2395340,2395700," payer"
2395700,2397220," is a key value"
2397220,2398000," key is a string"
2398000,2398760," value is a string"
2398760,2399520," all right"
2399520,2400520," so and"
2400520,2401320," when we're making"
2401320,2402140," a parser combinator"
2402140,2402860," by the way"
2402860,2404020," I think I made a"
2404020,2404840," mistake"
2404840,2405820," so as you can"
2405820,2406940," see it uses"
2406940,2407980," polymorphic parameter"
2407980,2408820," but I never"
2408820,2409860," actually parameterized"
2409860,2410480," this type here"
2410480,2410980," so it actually"
2410980,2411600," has to be something"
2411600,2412020," like this"
2412020,2413260," so that means"
2413260,2414040," what you will"
2414040,2414580," have to do"
2414580,2415120," in me"
2415120,2416580," is essentially"
2416580,2419660," a list"
2419660,2420700," of sections"
2420700,2421380," so we have a"
2421380,2422080," section and list"
2422080,2422300," of it"
2422300,2422840," and you have a"
2422840,2423280," parser"
2423280,2424220," that returns"
2424220,2425400," a list of sections"
2425400,2426400," that's what it does"
2426400,2427660," right"
2427660,2428620," it returns a list"
2428620,2429220," of sections"
2429220,2431860," cool"
2431860,2435200," what's a parser"
2435200,2435600," combinator"
2435600,2436160," you"
2436160,2437960," can read"
2437960,2439020," a white paper"
2439020,2439920," about that"
2439920,2441080," so it's"
2441080,2442860," it's described"
2442860,2443200," here"
2443200,2444220," and on top"
2444220,2444560," of that"
2444560,2445240," you can watch"
2445240,2445800," my video"
2445800,2446940," about json parsing"
2446940,2447440," in haskell"
2447440,2448460," where I actually"
2448460,2449040," implemented"
2449040,2450640," monadic parser"
2450640,2451040," combinators"
2451040,2451600," in haskell"
2451600,2452220," from scratch"
2452220,2453500," so yeah"
2453500,2455040," so to get"
2455040,2455700," into the topic"
2455700,2456400," I would recommend"
2456400,2457260," these two things"
2457260,2458040," this paper"
2458040,2459560," and this video"
2459560,2460760," so yeah"
2460760,2461840," essentially"
2461840,2463000," parser combinators"
2463000,2464560," is like small parsers"
2464560,2465740," that are responsible"
2465740,2466560," for parsing"
2466560,2467580," small things"
2467580,2468940," and then you can"
2468940,2469640," combine them"
2469640,2470120," to parse"
2470120,2471000," bigger things"
2471000,2471940," right"
2471940,2473520," so for example"
2473520,2474340," you have a parser"
2474340,2475780," that parses"
2475780,2476300," numbers"
2476300,2477520," and you can"
2477520,2478380," have a parser"
2478380,2479020," that parses"
2479020,2479440," lists"
2479440,2480680," and you can"
2480680,2481320," combine them"
2481320,2481900," together with"
2481900,2482680," special operators"
2482680,2483280," and you can get"
2483280,2483640," a parser"
2483640,2484260," that parses"
2484260,2485520," a list"
2485520,2486120," of integers"
2486120,2487860," so yeah"
2487860,2488220," you have"
2488220,2488620," like a lot"
2488620,2489340," of small parses"
2489340,2489880," and you combine"
2489880,2490120," them"
2490120,2491020," making a bigger"
2491020,2491480," and bigger"
2491480,2492000," parser"
2492000,2492940," so"
2492940,2494440," like power"
2494440,2494680," ranges"
2494680,2495060," exactly"
2495060,2495520," that's a pretty"
2495520,2496060," good analogy"
2496060,2496480," thank you"
2496480,2496740," jeng"
2496740,2497160," yes"
2497160,2497480," yes"
2497480,2504600," and that's"
2504600,2504920," what we're"
2504920,2505480," developing today"
2505480,2505840," in the camel"
2505840,2511640," all right"
2511640,2512260," so"
2512260,2514580," but this"
2514580,2517320," just returns"
2517320,2518120," a result"
2518120,2519380," so which is"
2519380,2520280," not enough"
2520280,2521280," which is not"
2521280,2521500," enough"
2521500,2522380," we will actually"
2522380,2523000," have to"
2523000,2526000," test it out"
2526000,2527800," so"
2527800,2529080," as you can"
2529080,2529580," remember"
2529580,2530200," probably"
2530200,2532420," if you run"
2532420,2532800," a parser"
2532800,2533180," combinator"
2533180,2535440," it returns"
2535440,2536580," the result"
2536580,2537420," right"
2537420,2538080," the result"
2538080,2538380," it doesn't"
2538380,2538820," return you"
2538820,2539560," the value"
2539560,2540140," right away"
2540140,2540500," it just"
2540500,2540920," returns you"
2540920,2541320," the result"
2541320,2542300," so the thing"
2542300,2542660," you have to"
2542660,2542760," do"
2542760,2543160," you have to"
2543160,2543780," match it"
2543780,2544380," and see"
2544380,2544740," if it's"
2544740,2545140," successful"
2545140,2545520," or not"
2545520,2545900," so"
2545900,2546700," you see"
2546700,2547280," we read"
2547280,2547520," the whole"
2547520,2547780," file"
2547780,2548620," we turn it"
2548620,2549020," into input"
2549020,2549480," and then"
2549480,2550060," we pass"
2550060,2550500," it into"
2550500,2551220," the parser"
2551220,2551600," combinator"
2551600,2552160," and we get"
2552160,2552480," some sort"
2552480,2552840," of result"
2552840,2553160," and now"
2553160,2553380," we need"
2553380,2553680," to find"
2553680,2553860," out"
2553860,2554040," whether"
2554040,2554380," it was"
2554380,2554840," successful"
2554840,2555440," or not"
2555440,2556380," if it was"
2556380,2556820," successful"
2556820,2557520," it returned"
2557520,2557960," okay"
2557960,2559380," and as far"
2559380,2559740," as you know"
2559740,2560320," in case of"
2560320,2560600," okay"
2560600,2561400," we're gonna"
2561400,2561900," have like"
2561900,2562400," the rest"
2562400,2562900," of the input"
2562900,2563680," somewhere here"
2563680,2564640," which I don't"
2564640,2565320," really care about"
2565320,2565840," and then"
2565840,2566120," we're gonna"
2566120,2566840," have sections"
2566840,2567720," somewhere here"
2567720,2569000," and we'll"
2569000,2569540," have to"
2569540,2570520," print those"
2570520,2571000," sections"
2571000,2572440," to do"
2572440,2574100," print parsed"
2574100,2574780," sections"
2574780,2576980," so in case"
2576980,2577840," of some"
2577840,2578280," sort of an"
2578280,2578600," error"
2578600,2579080," right"
2579080,2579460," some sort"
2579460,2579680," of an"
2579680,2579900," error"
2579900,2580420," we will"
2580420,2580840," get"
2580840,2583600," this error"
2583600,2584140," description"
2584140,2584560," thing"
2584840,2585520," this error"
2585520,2585920," description"
2585920,2586260," thing"
2586260,2588200," so I'm"
2588200,2588480," gonna put"
2588480,2588760," it like"
2588760,2589020," that"
2589020,2589460," and then"
2589460,2589760," we need"
2589760,2590220," to actually"
2590220,2590760," print"
2590760,2591480," that error"
2591480,2592000," somehow"
2592000,2593060," so the"
2593060,2593460," question is"
2593460,2593840," gonna be"
2593840,2594380," how"
2594380,2596200," so I'm"
2596200,2596420," thinking"
2596420,2597680," maybe"
2597680,2602260," yeah"
2602260,2602640," maybe we"
2602640,2602920," can just"
2602920,2603240," print it"
2603240,2603420," like"
2603420,2604060," so"
2604060,2605020," so it's"
2605020,2605480," gonna be"
2605480,2606520," printf"
2606520,2608140," printf"
2608140,2611600," so could"
2611600,2612580," error"
2612580,2613920," happened"
2613920,2614820," at"
2614820,2614840," at"
2614840,2615460," d"
2615460,2616560," and then"
2616560,2616960," we can"
2616960,2617280," print"
2617280,2617520," the"
2617520,2617860," description"
2617860,2618080," of"
2618080,2618240," that"
2618240,2618500," error"
2618500,2618800," so"
2618800,2619120," we"
2619120,2619280," know"
2619280,2619420," the"
2619420,2619800," position"
2619800,2620120," where"
2620120,2620560," exactly"
2620560,2620720," it"
2620720,2621000," happened"
2621000,2621860," right"
2621860,2622220," we know"
2622220,2622580," exact"
2622580,2623060," position"
2623060,2623700," so we put"
2623700,2624120," the position"
2624120,2624720," and we also"
2624720,2625060," have"
2625060,2626040," the exact"
2626040,2626640," description"
2626640,2627220," of what"
2627220,2627640," happened"
2627640,2627900," there"
2627900,2629460," so it's not"
2629460,2629900," really description"
2629900,2630240," it's just"
2630240,2630540," desk"
2630540,2631200," so this is how"
2631200,2631440," we're gonna"
2631440,2632000," print the error"
2632000,2632520," for now"
2632520,2634680," so and"
2634680,2637340," hello"
2637340,2637780," chromosome"
2637780,2638280," drift"
2638280,2638860," welcome to"
2638860,2639100," the stream"
2639100,2639740," if you make"
2639740,2640400," section a pair"
2640400,2641060," of key pair"
2641060,2641680," list you can"
2641680,2642360," have nested"
2642360,2642800," sections"
2642800,2643440," and have"
2643440,2644600," sections"
2644600,2646100," as well"
2646100,2647800," I don't know"
2647800,2648560," we're just"
2648560,2649340," testing a"
2649340,2650280," parsing library"
2650280,2650780," combinator"
2650780,2651480," like a"
2651480,2652080," parsing community"
2652080,2652460," library"
2652460,2653100," I don't know"
2653100,2653860," it doesn't matter"
2653860,2654360," in my opinion"
2654360,2656720," so we just"
2656720,2657320," need something"
2657320,2657820," whatever"
2657820,2661240," I might as well"
2661240,2661920," actually just"
2661920,2662660," use json"
2662660,2663380," or something"
2663380,2663660," else"
2663660,2664180," xml"
2664180,2665640," don't care"
2665640,2666900," so this is"
2666900,2667460," the format"
2667460,2667980," is not the"
2667980,2668600," focus of"
2668600,2668940," what I'm"
2668940,2669300," doing right"
2669300,2669500," now"
2669500,2671100," the library"
2671100,2671780," is the"
2671780,2672240," focus of"
2672240,2672480," what I'm"
2672480,2672720," doing"
2672720,2673500," library is"
2673500,2673980," more important"
2673980,2675440," so and"
2675440,2676340," what I need"
2676340,2676580," to do"
2676580,2676960," I need to"
2676960,2677400," print all"
2677400,2677760," of that"
2677760,2678900," so maybe"
2678900,2679140," I can"
2679140,2679560," just do"
2679560,2679960," print"
2679960,2680580," sections"
2680580,2683560," and we'll"
2683560,2683920," just have"
2683920,2684320," to implement"
2684320,2684640," this"
2684640,2686700," function"
2686700,2687260," somehow"
2687260,2689220," so print"
2689220,2689760," sections"
2689760,2690680," and"
2690680,2691640," let"
2691640,2692300," print"
2692300,2697800," let"
2697800,2698360," print"
2698360,2699360," sections"
2699360,2700700," what is"
2700700,2701240," a parser"
2701240,2702160," you can"
2702160,2702500," google it"
2702500,2702740," up"
2702740,2704880," check out"
2704880,2705540," like"
2705540,2706100," parser"
2706100,2708100," parser"
2708100,2713140," is"
2713140,2713480," something"
2713480,2713500," something"
2713500,2713740," that"
2713740,2714280," parses"
2714280,2714860," right"
2714860,2715880," parsing"
2715880,2716320," syntax"
2716320,2716800," analysis"
2716800,2716980," of"
2716980,2717300," syntactic"
2717300,2717620," analysis"
2717620,2718020," the process"
2718020,2718200," of"
2718200,2718520," analyzing"
2718520,2718900," string"
2718900,2719080," and"
2719080,2719400," symbols"
2719400,2719720," either"
2719720,2719900," in"
2719900,2720120," natural"
2720120,2720400," language"
2720400,2720680," computer"
2720680,2720940," language"
2720940,2721260," or data"
2721260,2721700," structure"
2721700,2722540," conforming"
2722540,2722800," rules"
2722800,2722920," of"
2722920,2723140," formal"
2723140,2723440," grammar"
2723440,2723940," so this"
2723940,2724360," is a"
2724360,2725080," parser"
2725080,2725820," is a thing"
2725820,2726500," or an"
2726500,2726780," object"
2726780,2726780," or an object"
2726780,2727500," that performs"
2727500,2728020," parsing"
2728020,2728560," and parsing"
2728560,2729080," is this"
2729080,2729980," so"
2729980,2730700," yeah"
2730700,2732400," hope that"
2732400,2732880," makes sense"
2732880,2734940," print"
2734940,2735720," sections"
2735720,2736480," and"
2736480,2736920," we're gonna"
2736920,2737260," accept"
2737260,2737700," sections"
2737700,2737960," here"
2737960,2738560," and"
2738560,2739500," it's gonna"
2739500,2740160," be a list"
2740160,2740740," of the"
2740740,2741180," sections"
2741180,2741680," that we're"
2741680,2742040," parsing"
2742040,2742580," of course"
2742580,2743880," we're gonna do"
2743880,2745100," fail with"
2745100,2745800," to do"
2745800,2753340," so"
2753340,2754140," now we need"
2754140,2754540," to read"
2754540,2754880," the whole"
2754880,2755260," file"
2755260,2755640," and this"
2755640,2756100," is where"
2756100,2756480," we're gonna"
2756480,2757160," start having"
2757160,2758760," a little bit"
2758760,2759280," of problems"
2759280,2759880," right"
2759880,2760440," so we'll have"
2760440,2760940," to figure out"
2760940,2761340," how to do"
2761340,2761580," that"
2761580,2762640," so but"
2762640,2763060," before we"
2763060,2763940," do all"
2763940,2764300," of that"
2764300,2764640," I think"
2764640,2764880," I need"
2764880,2765800," to try"
2765800,2766280," to build"
2766280,2766740," everything"
2766740,2767680," I need"
2767680,2767920," to try"
2767920,2768260," to build"
2768260,2768640," everything"
2768640,2771600," all right"
2771600,2772060," let's try"
2772060,2772900," to build"
2772900,2773520," any"
2773520,2774560," example"
2774560,2775540," so any"
2775540,2776020," example"
2776020,2776740," depends"
2776740,2777840," on"
2777840,2782500," any"
2782500,2782980," ml"
2782980,2783720," right"
2783720,2784340," and it"
2784340,2785160," also depends"
2785160,2785940," on the"
2785940,2786380," library"
2786380,2786840," itself"
2786840,2787160," here"
2787160,2787660," so"
2787660,2788120," yeah"
2788120,2789140," so"
2789140,2789980," src"
2789980,2790480," bar"
2790480,2791120," comb"
2791120,2792280," dot ml"
2792280,2793580," there we go"
2793580,2795980," so"
2795980,2796580," and"
2796580,2797420," we'll have"
2797420,2798100," to use"
2798100,2800640," we'll have"
2800640,2800920," to use"
2800920,2801280," a camel"
2801280,2801860," find"
2801860,2803240," a camel"
2803240,2803540," find"
2803540,2803880," to build"
2803880,2804200," all that"
2804200,2804520," a camel"
2804520,2804960," a camel"
2804960,2805300," find"
2805300,2805740," is like"
2805740,2806180," a package"
2806180,2806660," config"
2806660,2807920," but for"
2807920,2808440," a camel"
2808440,2809020," that's"
2809020,2809260," what it"
2809260,2809900," is"
2809900,2810700," not using"
2810700,2811100," cbt"
2811100,2812020," cbt"
2812020,2812460," was just"
2812460,2812760," a shit"
2812760,2813020," post"
2813020,2813400," I'm sorry"
2813400,2817540," I mean"
2817540,2818020," why would you"
2818020,2818420," want to use"
2818420,2818540," it"
2818540,2818940," it's just"
2818940,2819980," I just"
2819980,2820300," wanted to"
2820300,2820700," see how"
2820700,2821300," you can use"
2821300,2821780," topological"
2821780,2822200," sort"
2822200,2822620," in"
2822620,2823460," in real"
2823460,2823740," world"
2823740,2824120," and that's"
2824120,2825200," it"
2825200,2831260," so"
2831260,2831540," okay"
2831540,2835240," we're"
2835240,2835320," gonna"
2835320,2835620," try"
2835620,2835980," to"
2835980,2837100," build"
2837100,2838500," natively"
2838500,2843760," a camel"
2843760,2843780," a camel"
2843780,2844400," find"
2844400,2847000," a camel"
2847000,2847420," opt"
2847420,2848620," so if"
2848620,2848960," I remember"
2848960,2849380," correctly"
2849380,2849880," I have to"
2849880,2850320," do like"
2850320,2850820," packages"
2850820,2851580," or just"
2851580,2852000," a single"
2852000,2852400," package"
2852400,2853560," I don't"
2853560,2853900," even need"
2853900,2854280," to link"
2854280,2854740," with any"
2854740,2855100," packages"
2855100,2855580," I think"
2855580,2855880," at this"
2855880,2856240," point"
2856240,2857820," yeah"
2857820,2859040," I can"
2859040,2859320," just do"
2859320,2859520," something"
2859520,2859780," like"
2859780,2860140," oh"
2860140,2861300," in"
2861300,2861560," me"
2861560,2862380," and"
2862380,2862780," then"
2862780,2863180," I can"
2863180,2863540," use"
2863540,2863940," these"
2863940,2864380," things"
2864380,2864680," to"
2864680,2864980," build"
2864980,2865240," all of"
2865240,2865380," that"
2865380,2865720," I wonder"
2865720,2866080," if it's"
2866080,2866580," gonna work"
2866580,2866840," let's"
2866840,2867080," actually"
2867080,2867720," find out"
2867720,2869220," let's"
2869220,2869480," actually"
2869480,2869780," quickly"
2869780,2870380," find out"
2870380,2870960," and"
2870960,2871620," it"
2871620,2872060," didn't"
2872060,2872520," work"
2872520,2873920," for some"
2873920,2874240," reason"
2874240,2875080," and I"
2875080,2875260," wonder"
2875260,2875700," why"
2875700,2881460," unbound"
2881460,2882060," module"
2882060,2883000," parkum"
2883000,2884240," ha"
2884240,2885700," so"
2885700,2886500," yeah"
2886500,2886860," this is"
2886860,2887020," where"
2887020,2887480," we're gonna"
2887480,2887940," start having"
2887940,2888300," the problem"
2888300,2888520," like"
2888520,2888760," I"
2888760,2889340," absolutely"
2889340,2891320," cannot"
2891320,2891860," comprehend"
2891860,2892160," a camel"
2892160,2892500," find"
2892500,2892940," because"
2892940,2893920," it just"
2893920,2894700," works"
2894700,2895140," differently"
2895140,2895580," depending"
2895580,2895940," on the"
2895940,2896420," combination"
2896420,2897160," of flags"
2897160,2897460," you can"
2897460,2897820," use the"
2897820,2898000," same"
2898000,2898360," flags"
2898360,2898680," you put"
2898680,2898820," them"
2898820,2898940," in"
2898940,2899140," different"
2899140,2899620," combination"
2899620,2899900," and"
2899900,2900220," sometimes"
2900220,2900400," it"
2900400,2900640," works"
2900640,2900980," sometimes"
2900980,2901180," it"
2901180,2902040," doesn't"
2902040,2902540," so"
2902540,2902920," it's"
2902920,2903180," just"
2903180,2904200," so"
2904200,2904640," bizarre"
2904640,2905580," to me"
2905580,2906000," uh"
2906000,2906480," feng qi"
2906480,2906720," hello"
2906720,2907120," feng qi"
2907120,2907360," welcome"
2907360,2907700," welcome"
2907700,2908020," welcome"
2908020,2908340," today"
2908340,2908760," we're"
2908760,2909520," doing"
2909520,2910480," a camel"
2910480,2911680," um"
2911680,2912140," all right"
2912140,2913620," example"
2913620,2914060," I need"
2914060,2914400," example"
2914400,2914820," of a camel"
2914820,2915200," find"
2915200,2917000," I need"
2917000,2917380," example"
2917380,2917840," of a camel"
2917840,2918300," find"
2918300,2918760," yeah"
2918760,2922240," so"
2922240,2922640," show me"
2922640,2922900," how to"
2922900,2923280," use a camel"
2923280,2923660," find"
2923660,2924360," internet"
2924360,2925120," show me"
2925120,2925440," how to"
2925440,2925860," use a camel"
2925860,2926200," find"
2926200,2927720," so"
2927720,2928400," yeah"
2928400,2928960," I was"
2928960,2929680," right"
2929680,2930320," so"
2930320,2930760," opt"
2930760,2932200," and it"
2932200,2932520," should just"
2932520,2932860," work"
2932860,2933480," it"
2933480,2934200," should just"
2934200,2934540," work"
2934540,2937440," but it"
2937440,2937800," doesn't"
2937800,2941060," compiling a camel"
2941060,2941440," is a real"
2941440,2941720," change"
2941720,2942340," exactly"
2942340,2943380," you get"
2943380,2943620," it"
2943620,2944760," you actually"
2944760,2945460," get it"
2945460,2950800," maybe it"
2950800,2951560," has something"
2951560,2952060," to do"
2952060,2952580," we can try"
2952580,2953300," to rename"
2953300,2954640," the parser"
2954640,2955580," to just"
2955580,2955900," T"
2955900,2958220," and here"
2958220,2961640," maybe"
2961640,2965280," yeah"
2965280,2965640," I think"
2965640,2966080," I know"
2966080,2966900," I think"
2966900,2967160," I know"
2967160,2967500," what's the"
2967500,2967760," problem"
2967760,2968080," here"
2968080,2970020," so"
2970020,2970900," let me"
2970900,2971320," try"
2971320,2971900," something"
2971900,2975120," let me"
2975120,2975300," try"
2975300,2975680," something"
2975680,2976100," we can"
2976100,2977060," can I"
2977060,2977420," do a"
2977420,2977640," camel"
2977640,2978180," find"
2978180,2979260," right"
2979260,2979780," and"
2979780,2981120," a camel"
2981120,2981540," opt"
2981540,2983040," and"
2983040,2983260," with"
2983260,2983700," help"
2983700,2984120," what"
2984120,2984340," kind"
2984340,2984460," of"
2984460,2984860," parameters"
2984860,2985220," can I"
2985220,2985440," have"
2985440,2985760," there"
2985760,2986900," can I"
2986900,2987160," have"
2987160,2987900," minus"
2987900,2988200," I"
2988200,2988500," okay"
2988500,2988800," so"
2988800,2989020," I"
2989020,2989780," think"
2989780,2990060," I need"
2990060,2990500," to set"
2990500,2990680," up"
2990680,2991000," minus"
2991000,2991280," I"
2991280,2991900," appropriately"
2991900,2992460," so"
2992460,2992560," it's"
2992560,2992660," going"
2992660,2992760," to"
2992760,2993040," minus"
2993040,2993400," I"
2993400,2993780," you can"
2993780,2994100," search"
2994100,2994300," in"
2994300,2994860," SRC"
2994860,2995080," and"
2995080,2995360," minus"
2995360,2995620," I"
2995620,2995900," you can"
2995900,2996140," search"
2996140,2996260," in"
2996260,2996660," examples"
2996660,2996920," I"
3011540,3015540," so"
3015540,3016060," we"
3016060,3016280," managed"
3016280,3016440," to"
3016440,3016580," build"
3016580,3016720," all"
3016720,3017000," that"
3017000,3019260," so"
3019260,3019720," everything"
3019720,3020440," compiles"
3020440,3021520," thank you"
3021520,3021820," thank you"
3021820,3022100," so much"
3022100,3022500," thank you"
3022500,3022720," thank you"
3022720,3022980," everyone"
3022980,3025060," okay"
3025060,3026260," so"
3026260,3026920," we have"
3026920,3027380," an example"
3027380,3027660," that"
3027660,3028160," compiles"
3028160,3029380," I think"
3029380,3029540," it's"
3029540,3029740," going to"
3029740,3030120," crash"
3030120,3030780," right"
3030780,3033480," so"
3033480,3033920," print"
3033920,3034800," sections"
3034800,3035560," is not"
3035560,3036260," implemented"
3036260,3037120," right"
3037120,3037480," this"
3037480,3037740," one"
3037740,3038060," is"
3038060,3039000," in"
3039000,3042200," parser"
3042200,3043480," combinator"
3043480,3044220," is not"
3044220,3044800," implemented"
3044800,3046600," and"
3046600,3049020," read"
3049020,3049500," whole"
3049500,3050060," file"
3050060,3050880," read whole"
3050880,3051200," file"
3051200,3051720," is not"
3051720,3052240," implemented"
3052240,3053880," right"
3053880,3054880," there we go"
3054880,3056540," and if I try"
3056540,3057040," to run this"
3057040,3057540," and I think"
3057540,3057980," it will tell"
3057980,3058540," me that"
3058540,3060100," any parser"
3060100,3060640," comment is not"
3060640,3061020," implemented"
3061020,3061320," okay"
3061320,3062000," makes sense"
3062000,3062520," makes sense"
3062520,3063920," okay"
3063920,3066440," but I think"
3066440,3066800," we're going to"
3066800,3067380," start with"
3067380,3068420," reading the"
3068420,3069500," whole file"
3069500,3070520," so I think"
3070520,3070860," it's going to"
3070860,3071160," be a very"
3071160,3071420," useful"
3071420,3071900," function"
3071900,3073680," OCaml"
3073680,3074380," read whole"
3074380,3074700," file"
3074700,3075580," I remember"
3075580,3076400," that I saw"
3076400,3077220," some of the"
3077220,3077760," examples on"
3077760,3078080," the internet"
3078080,3078500," that I could"
3078500,3079040," just steal"
3079040,3080740," and"
3080740,3082260," yep"
3082260,3083240," we can"
3083240,3083980," yeah"
3083980,3084420," this is the"
3084420,3084700," example"
3084700,3085280," I saw"
3085280,3086180," so essentially"
3086180,3086840," you open a"
3086840,3087200," file"
3087200,3088440," like as a"
3088440,3088840," channel"
3088840,3090580," then you"
3090580,3091080," read"
3091080,3093200," into a"
3093200,3093900," string of"
3093900,3094540," the size"
3094540,3094860," of the"
3094860,3095180," channel"
3095180,3095500," you can"
3095500,3095760," actually"
3095760,3096320," take the"
3096320,3096880," size of"
3096880,3097340," the channel"
3097340,3098520," and then"
3098520,3098880," you can"
3098880,3099780," really"
3099780,3100660," input"
3100660,3101100," string"
3101100,3101840," so there's"
3101840,3102140," there's"
3102140,3102460," actually"
3102460,3103080," function"
3103080,3103840," input"
3103840,3104200," string"
3104200,3104560," and"
3104560,3104960," really"
3104960,3105340," input"
3105340,3105720," string"
3105720,3106200," I think"
3106200,3106400," let's"
3106400,3106580," actually"
3106580,3108120," find out"
3108120,3116060," so there's"
3116060,3116540," input"
3116540,3117160," string"
3117160,3117980," yeah"
3117980,3118180," yeah"
3118180,3119080," yeah"
3119080,3120080," really"
3120080,3122300," really"
3122300,3122560," input"
3122560,3122960," string"
3122960,3129120," really"
3129120,3129400," really"
3129400,3129800," yeah"
3129800,3130120," really"
3130120,3130380," really"
3130380,3130640," input"
3130640,3130940," string"
3130940,3131160," yeah"
3131160,3131480," fucking"
3131480,3131920," classic"
3131920,3132320," isn't"
3132320,3132500," not"
3132500,3133500," I think"
3133500,3133740," it's a"
3133740,3133960," fucking"
3133960,3134360," classic"
3134360,3134860," all right"
3134860,3135360," so"
3135360,3136560," how are we"
3136560,3136700," going to"
3136700,3136940," implement"
3136940,3137240," all of"
3137240,3137420," that"
3137420,3140320," so we"
3140320,3140620," have to"
3140620,3141060," open"
3141060,3143000," input"
3143000,3143480," channel"
3143480,3143880," for this"
3143880,3144200," particular"
3144200,3144880," file path"
3144880,3146460," so here's"
3146460,3147100," our channel"
3147100,3148180," then we"
3148180,3148660," can take"
3148660,3149560," the size"
3149560,3150020," of this"
3150020,3150400," channel"
3150400,3150920," right"
3150920,3151460," so it's"
3151460,3151840," basically"
3151840,3152200," in"
3152200,3152840," channel"
3152840,3153480," length"
3153480,3155260," channel"
3155260,3155720," length"
3155720,3156360," if you're"
3156360,3156760," opening the"
3156760,3157300," file usually"
3157300,3157780," you can"
3157780,3158720," relatively"
3158720,3159360," easy get"
3159360,3159840," the whole"
3159840,3160480," size of"
3160480,3160960," the channel"
3160960,3161800," and then"
3161800,3162120," you can"
3162120,3162680," really"
3162680,3164060," really"
3164060,3164580," read"
3164580,3165740," really"
3165740,3166240," input"
3166240,3167520," string"
3167520,3168100," this entire"
3168100,3168540," thing"
3168540,3169240," right"
3169240,3169640," you provide"
3169640,3170360," ch and you provide"
3170360,3170840," the size"
3170840,3171820," and"
3171820,3172920," it's quite"
3172920,3173460," important to"
3173460,3174060," actually"
3174060,3175260," first"
3175260,3176220," close"
3176220,3177780," the opened"
3177780,3178100," file"
3178100,3178740," close that"
3178740,3179040," channel"
3179040,3179680," and then"
3179680,3180140," return"
3180140,3181020," what you"
3181020,3181900," read"
3181900,3182880," but pretty much"
3182880,3183540," this is pretty much"
3183540,3183900," it"
3183900,3185640," this is pretty much"
3185640,3186300," this is pretty much"
3186300,3187000," the function that"
3187000,3187660," reads the whole"
3187660,3188040," file"
3188040,3188900," let's see if"
3188900,3189540," all of that"
3189540,3190040," compiles"
3190040,3190740," let's see if"
3190740,3191060," all of that"
3191060,3191400," compiles"
3191400,3191980," it seems to be"
3191980,3192380," compiling"
3192380,3193780," quite nicely"
3193780,3194440," i wonder"
3194440,3195560," if i can"
3195560,3196300," test this"
3196300,3196760," function"
3196760,3197540," in my"
3197540,3199660," in my"
3199660,3199960," ripple"
3199960,3201180," i'm not sure"
3201180,3201780," if i can"
3201780,3203980," because i think"
3203980,3204640," to load"
3204640,3205340," it up"
3205340,3207060," maybe i can"
3207060,3207440," just do"
3207440,3207860," use"
3207860,3209000," examples"
3209000,3211120," in ml"
3211120,3212960," okay"
3212960,3213660," so"
3213660,3214100," yeah"
3214100,3214600," you can"
3214600,3215100," just easily"
3215100,3215560," do that"
3215560,3216060," unfortunately"
3216060,3217380," so"
3217380,3218000," you'll have"
3218000,3218540," to load"
3218540,3220400," recursively"
3220400,3221020," this entire"
3221020,3221320," thing"
3221320,3221700," and can"
3221700,3221920," you"
3221920,3222280," use"
3222280,3222980," recursively"
3222980,3224720," yeah"
3224720,3225020," you"
3225020,3225360," cannot"
3225360,3225720," okay"
3225720,3226640," so"
3226640,3227360," we"
3227360,3227860," compiled"
3227860,3228140," this"
3228140,3228440," entire"
3228440,3228800," thing"
3228800,3229120," with the"
3229120,3229360," by"
3229360,3229920," like"
3229920,3230300," with the"
3230300,3230540," native"
3230540,3230940," code"
3230940,3231300," but we"
3231300,3231540," need to"
3231540,3231900," compile it"
3231900,3232100," with a"
3232100,3232300," byte"
3232300,3232600," code"
3232600,3244560," it's"
3244560,3244880," it's"
3244880,3245260," professional"
3245260,3245660," php"
3245660,3245880," death"
3245880,3246220," for two"
3246220,3246540," months"
3246540,3246960," nice"
3246960,3248060," how did"
3248060,3248320," you like"
3248320,3261420," yep"
3261420,3263560," yeah i want to"
3263560,3264000," test it out"
3264000,3264460," that's what i"
3264460,3264920," wanted to do"
3264920,3265620," i wanted to"
3265620,3266120," test it out"
3266120,3269780," but to do"
3269780,3270660," that i need to"
3270660,3271420," recompile this"
3271420,3271740," entire"
3271740,3272720," in a byte"
3272720,3273040," code"
3273040,3273860," so it's going"
3273860,3274180," to be very"
3274180,3274520," similar"
3274520,3277880," it was just"
3277880,3279480," laravel and i"
3279480,3280020," knew jungle"
3280020,3280580," which is pretty"
3280580,3280900," similar"
3280900,3281320," oh okay"
3281320,3281740," not"
3281740,3283100," i see"
3283100,3284380," that makes"
3284380,3284600," sense"
3284600,3286220," all right"
3286220,3286680," so it's going"
3286680,3287020," to be very"
3287020,3287340," similar"
3287340,3287660," build"
3287660,3288500," but"
3288500,3290200," instead of"
3290200,3290580," this shit"
3290580,3291280," we're going"
3291280,3291860," to use"
3291860,3292380," a c"
3292380,3294040," so i might"
3294040,3294280," as well"
3294280,3294860," actually add"
3294860,3295300," a phony"
3295300,3295940," target that"
3295940,3296500," builds both"
3296500,3296880," of them"
3296880,3297800," which is"
3297800,3298040," going to be"
3298040,3298400," convenient"
3298400,3299420," build both"
3299420,3299720," of them"
3299720,3300820," and this"
3300820,3301420," one is"
3301420,3301980," of course"
3301980,3304340," phony"
3304340,3307460," camel"
3307460,3307920," compiles to"
3307920,3308220," bytecode"
3308220,3308460," yeah"
3308460,3309140," so it"
3309140,3309560," basically"
3309560,3310840," yeah"
3310840,3311700," it can"
3311700,3312300," compile to"
3312300,3313040," its own"
3313040,3313840," bytecode"
3313840,3314580," of its"
3314580,3314980," own"
3314980,3315380," virtual"
3315380,3315760," machine"
3315760,3316760," or"
3316760,3317280," it can"
3317280,3317620," compile"
3317620,3318460," natively"
3318460,3319160," both of"
3319160,3319440," them"
3319440,3320120," so which"
3320120,3320360," one do"
3320360,3320660," you prefer"
3320660,3322240," i'm gonna"
3322240,3322700," even show"
3322700,3322860," you"
3322860,3323680," i'm gonna"
3323680,3324060," even show"
3324060,3324160," you"
3324160,3324340," i think"
3324340,3324620," i already"
3324620,3325000," show that"
3325000,3325280," at some"
3325280,3325520," point"
3325520,3325780," but"
3325780,3326360," yeah"
3326360,3327480," so let"
3327480,3327580," me"
3327580,3327940," let me"
3327940,3328180," do"
3328180,3328500," like"
3328500,3328860," all"
3328860,3330120," oh"
3330120,3330480," shit"
3330480,3330980," it actually"
3330980,3331600," was very"
3331600,3331900," bad"
3331900,3332300," because"
3332300,3333080," i need"
3333080,3333340," to"
3333340,3334640," do"
3334640,3335020," something"
3335020,3335420," like"
3335420,3335920," init"
3335920,3336420," here"
3336420,3337020," and then"
3337020,3337520," bytes"
3337520,3338520," then i'm gonna"
3338520,3339080," recompile one"
3339080,3339380," more time"
3339380,3340260," so"
3340260,3341160," yeah"
3341160,3342180," so i just"
3342180,3342520," created"
3342520,3343100," like two"
3343100,3343580," files"
3343580,3344140," and as you"
3344140,3344440," can see"
3344440,3345220," the bytecode"
3345220,3345500," one"
3345500,3345980," is way"
3345980,3346400," smaller"
3346400,3346760," than"
3346760,3347420," native"
3347420,3347640," one"
3347640,3347960," this is"
3347960,3348300," the native"
3348300,3348600," one"
3348600,3349260," and this"
3349260,3349380," is"
3349380,3349740," bytecode"
3349740,3350020," one"
3350020,3350660," if we"
3350660,3351620," if we inspect"
3351620,3352000," the native"
3352000,3352540," one it will"
3352540,3353080," tell us that"
3353080,3353460," it's a"
3353460,3354360," elf 64-bit"
3354360,3354960," executable"
3354960,3355820," and it's"
3355820,3356300," pretty lightweight"
3356300,3357100," it doesn't depend"
3357100,3357780," on much"
3357780,3358380," except"
3358380,3359300," libc and stuff"
3359300,3359620," like that"
3359620,3360220," nothing special"
3360220,3361080," but if i take a look"
3361080,3361340," at the"
3361340,3361980," init bytes"
3361980,3364360," it will tell us"
3364360,3364980," that it's"
3364980,3366600," a camel run script"
3366600,3367280," executable"
3367280,3368320," binary data"
3368320,3369240," and this one is"
3369240,3369720," actually very"
3369720,3370060," interesting"
3370060,3370800," it's literally"
3370800,3371920," a binary file"
3371920,3372800," except"
3372800,3373740," at the top"
3373740,3374640," it has a"
3374640,3375200," shebang"
3375200,3375920," for the"
3375920,3376360," interpreter"
3376360,3376840," of that"
3376840,3377380," bytecode"
3377380,3378440," so that's"
3378440,3378920," basically"
3378920,3379640," a camel"
3379640,3380240," compiled"
3380240,3380980," into its"
3380980,3381240," own"
3381240,3381820," bytecode"
3381820,3388680," and i"
3388680,3389280," especially like"
3389280,3389760," the absolute"
3389760,3390340," path here"
3390340,3393040," yes it does"
3393040,3393540," have hot"
3393540,3394080," reloading"
3394080,3394580," and debugging"
3394580,3394980," and that's"
3394980,3395240," why i'm"
3395240,3395740," compiling it"
3395740,3396240," with bytecode"
3396240,3396720," so i can"
3396720,3397060," use"
3397060,3398420," utop"
3398420,3401240," utop"
3401240,3402080," to load"
3402080,3402960," the module"
3402960,3403580," so now i"
3403580,3403980," should be able"
3403980,3404500," to do something"
3404500,3404840," like"
3404840,3406220," src"
3406220,3408360," parcum"
3408360,3408800," by the way"
3408800,3409120," parcum"
3409120,3409560," is the name"
3409560,3410120," of the library"
3410120,3410660," of parser"
3410660,3411140," combinators"
3411140,3412060," and i can just"
3412060,3412520," load it up"
3412520,3413260," and i have"
3413260,3413840," this module"
3413840,3414240," here"
3414240,3416480," probably"
3416480,3417640," i don't know"
3417640,3418100," where it is"
3418100,3418680," but it's supposed"
3418680,3419160," to be somewhere"
3419160,3419520," here"
3419520,3422960," but yeah"
3422960,3423480," something"
3423480,3424560," went wrong"
3424560,3425940," cumerlib"
3425940,3426560," yeah exactly"
3426560,3427420," parser"
3427420,3428900," unbound"
3428900,3429240," module"
3429240,3429780," parcum"
3429780,3430840," something is"
3430840,3431380," weird going"
3431380,3431640," on"
3431640,3432440," so it shouldn't"
3432440,3433000," be like that"
3433000,3433980," but okay"
3433980,3438360," we'll see"
3438360,3441560," but yeah"
3441560,3441820," it should"
3441820,3442820," actually work"
3442820,3443720," but it doesn't"
3443720,3444320," for some reason"
3444320,3446700," maybe we can"
3446700,3447340," try to"
3447340,3447940," build"
3447940,3448520," like"
3448520,3449100," remove"
3449100,3449640," everything"
3449640,3450020," here"
3450020,3451180," and maybe"
3451180,3452020," also remove"
3452020,3453660," stuff that"
3453660,3454240," was generated"
3454240,3454920," by examples"
3454920,3455380," and whatnot"
3455380,3457700," and i'm"
3457700,3458100," gonna only"
3458100,3458500," build"
3458500,3459060," init"
3459060,3459860," bytes"
3459860,3460340," maybe"
3460340,3460600," they"
3460600,3461000," interfere"
3461000,3461220," with"
3461220,3461380," each"
3461380,3461640," other"
3461640,3463080," and if i restart"
3463080,3463820," this entire stuff"
3463820,3464380," i'm gonna try"
3464380,3465020," to load"
3465020,3466640," src"
3466640,3468120," parcum"
3468120,3468160," parcum"
3468160,3469340," cmo"
3469340,3470720," parcum"
3470720,3471540," and still"
3471540,3472100," doesn't work"
3472100,3472520," that's very"
3472520,3472960," strange"
3472960,3474000," hmm"
3474000,3477180," maybe this"
3477180,3477440," is"
3477440,3478800," no"
3478800,3479840," everything seems"
3479840,3480340," to be okay"
3480340,3481020," it's just"
3481020,3483320," it's used"
3483320,3484040," it worked"
3484040,3484540," before"
3484540,3486200," but it doesn't"
3486200,3487040," work anymore"
3487040,3489760," utop"
3489760,3491060," load"
3491060,3492900," parcum"
3492900,3493500," cmo"
3493500,3494700," oh now"
3494700,3495180," it works"
3495180,3496000," is this"
3496000,3496200," big"
3496200,3498620," okay"
3498620,3499560," so i can"
3499560,3500020," also now"
3500020,3500560," make input"
3500560,3501060," if i have"
3501060,3501480," some sort"
3501480,3501920," of a"
3501920,3502560," string"
3502560,3502960," i can"
3502960,3503340," type it"
3503340,3503760," into the"
3503760,3504240," make input"
3504240,3504600," and it"
3504600,3504800," will"
3504800,3505460," turn it"
3505460,3505820," into an"
3505820,3506040," input"
3506040,3506440," and stuff"
3506440,3506820," like that"
3506820,3507180," so"
3507180,3507580," yeah"
3507580,3507860," it's"
3507860,3508020," pretty"
3508020,3508260," it's"
3508260,3508380," pretty"
3508380,3508580," cool"
3508580,3510140," so"
3510140,3511540," i can"
3511540,3511860," have"
3511860,3512280," dynamic"
3512280,3512980," reloading"
3512980,3513380," and whatnot"
3513380,3513820," but if"
3513820,3514120," i need"
3514120,3514640," speed"
3514640,3515420," at any"
3515420,3515680," point"
3515680,3516020," i can"
3516020,3516220," just"
3516220,3516600," compile"
3516600,3516780," it"

3704800,3705000," the"
3705000,3705380," function"

3710380,3710780," I can"
3710780,3711060," know"
3711060,3711780," so"

3713760,3714140," probably"
3714140,3714540," just"
3714540,3716380," comment"
3716380,3716560," it"
3716560,3716780," out"

3717040,3717320," it's"
3717320,3717780," executed"
3717780,3718280," like"

3718940,3719120," you"

3720300,3720480," you"

3721700,3722000," maybe"

3725000,3725420," yeah"
3725420,3725540," I"
3725540,3725700," have"

3731440,3732020," finally"
3732020,3733320," but"
3733320,3733840," that"
3733840,3734240," doesn't"
3734240,3734580," work"
3734580,3737980," you"
3737980,3738100," know"

3738300,3738680," whatever"
3738680,3738960," I"
3738960,3739300," just"
3739300,3739500," wanted"

3739880,3740080," this"

3741660,3741960," ripple"

3746920,3747220," about"
3747220,3747380," it"
3747380,3747580," like"
3747580,3747720," it"
3747720,3747980," just"
3747980,3748720," doesn't"
3748720,3748900," make"
3748900,3749000," it"
3749000,3749200," easier"
3749200,3749400," yeah"
3749400,3749820," exactly"
3749820,3749980," I"
3749980,3750120," need"
3750120,3750360," something"
3750360,3750580," like"
3750580,3750760," that"

3750900,3751100," for"
3751100,3751500," camel"
3751500,3752380," yes"
3752380,3755420," I"
3755420,3755720," wonder"
3755720,3755960," if"
3755960,3756180," it's"
3756180,3756580," possible"
3756580,3756980," to"
3756980,3757580," have"
3757580,3757900," something"
3757900,3758140," like"
3758140,3758400," that"
3758400,3758680," I'm"
3758680,3758820," not"
3758820,3759040," quite"
3759040,3759360," sure"
3759360,3762840," you"
3762840,3763000," was"
3763000,3763240," writing"
3763240,3763680," int"
3763680,3764120," ah"
3764120,3764380," okay"
3764380,3764700," thank"
3764700,3764820," you"
3764820,3765100," thank"
3765100,3765200," you"
3765200,3765340," so"
3765340,3765580," much"
3765580,3766900," so"
3766900,3768580," read"
3768580,3769060," whole"
3769060,3769500," file"
3769500,3769780," okay"
3769780,3770040," thank"
3770040,3770180," you"
3770180,3770580," I'm"
3770580,3770680," an"
3770680,3770880," idiot"
3770880,3771380," apparently"
3771380,3773060," so"
3773060,3773420," can"
3773420,3773700," I have"
3773700,3773860," like"
3773860,3774360," examples"
3774360,3775260," test"
3775260,3776000," in"
3776000,3778800," finally"
3778800,3780420," we managed"
3780420,3781080," to test"
3781080,3781880," the function"
3781880,3782260," that I"
3782260,3782600," wrote"
3782600,3783080," why"
3783080,3783520," it is"
3783520,3783800," so"
3783800,3784340," difficult"
3784340,3784960," I"
3784960,3785140," have"
3785140,3785380," no"
3785380,3785780," idea"
3785780,3786420," I"
3786420,3786560," have"
3786560,3786760," no"
3786760,3787060," idea"
3787060,3787480," why"
3787480,3787700," it"
3787700,3787880," is"
3787880,3788120," so"
3788120,3788460," fucking"
3788460,3789000," difficult"
3789000,3796620," so"
3796620,3796840," but"
3796840,3796960," it"
3796960,3797120," is"
3797120,3797360," fucking"
3797360,3797740," difficult"
3797740,3798120," apparently"
3798120,3799780," anyways"
3799780,3803320," cool"
3803320,3804900," so"
3804900,3805940," we have"
3805940,3806320," that"
3806320,3806980," and also"
3806980,3808680," we want to be able to print sections"
3808680,3809320," so"
3809320,3810680," I suppose"
3810680,3813880," we need a function that prints a single section"
3813880,3815200," a single one"
3815200,3816300," it takes a section"
3816300,3818820," maybe sec"
3818820,3820100," section"
3820100,3821120," and just prints it"
3821120,3823060," and essentially what we can do"
3823060,3824660," we can take all the sections here"
3824660,3825480," sections"
3825480,3827640," iterate them"
3827640,3828900," with print section"
3828900,3829520," there we go"
3829520,3830320," simple as that"
3830320,3832220," how would you print a single section"
3832220,3832680," well"
3832680,3836820," I just realized that the section is not"
3836820,3838300," a list"
3838300,3839280," of pairs"
3839280,3840900," it's actually a title"
3840900,3842040," or the name"
3842040,3843040," it also has the name"
3843040,3843760," alright"
3843760,3844800," so it has a name"
3844800,3846960," and it also has"
3846960,3847440," pairs"
3847440,3848260," right"
3848260,3849680," so this is how it's gonna go"
3849680,3852060," it has a name"
3852060,3853560," and it also has the pairs"
3853560,3855260," right"
3855260,3856140," so"
3856140,3859360," how are we gonna print all of that"
3859360,3860620," how are we gonna print all of that"
3860620,3861060," that's a good"
3861060,3861860," cool function"
3861860,3862580," unfortunately"
3862580,3864840," you cannot easily just serialize types"
3864840,3865480," in a camel"
3865480,3867120," so"
3867120,3868240," you have to"
3868240,3868560," you know"
3868560,3869720," write printers yourself"
3869720,3873460," do you have a functional programming primer"
3873460,3874280," I have no idea"
3874280,3876000," what the hell are you talking about"
3876000,3877360," thank you for asking the question"
3877360,3878500," so"
3878500,3880620," okay"
3880620,3881500," can I do that"
3881500,3881840," actually"
3881840,3883420," print any type"
3883420,3886780," how do I print one"
3886780,3888000," any type"
3888000,3888000," any type"
3888000,3888440," yeah"
3888440,3896760," okay"
3896760,3902620," ppx deriving show"
3902620,3904720," you may use ppx deriving show"
3904720,3906500," plugin for ppx deriving"
3906500,3908060," so is that something"
3908060,3908720," that we can have"
3908720,3909040," actually"
3909040,3909920," I cannot find"
3909920,3911240," list"
3911240,3912920," and"
3912920,3913680," maybe"
3913680,3915280," deriving"
3915280,3916320," no"
3916320,3917820," it's a third party dependencies"
3917820,3921160," primary like a beginner guide"
3921160,3922500," no I don't have anything of them"
3922500,3922760," sorry"
3922760,3925020," you may want to check out my youtube channel"
3925020,3926380," or my haskell rank series"
3926380,3929160," but I'm not sure how beginner friendly they are"
3929160,3931120," okay"
3931120,3931980," so there's nothing"
3931980,3933020," for that"
3933020,3934020," so we have to do that"
3934020,3934800," ourselves"
3934800,3937840," so that's what we'll have to do"
3937840,3939260," we'll have to define it like this"
3939260,3941000," and we're gonna have a name"
3941000,3943180," which is s"
3943180,3945540," and then we're gonna have pairs"
3945540,3952800," which I'm not even sure"
3952800,3955700," a good idea in general"
3955700,3956860," but we'll see"
3956860,3957460," we'll see"
3957460,3961800," I don't want to print them"
3961800,3963760," in exactly the same format"
3963760,3965260," because it's gonna be unclear"
3965260,3967360," if we manage to parse them or not"
3967360,3970440," it's gonna be clear"
3970440,3971080," okay"
3971080,3972360," so maybe I can do something like"
3972360,3973660," show sections"
3973660,3974160," right"
3974160,3975080," show sections"
3975080,3977100," and we're gonna return string instead"
3977100,3978740," so I will be able to do it"
3978740,3979840," I will be able to map"
3979840,3981960," show a single section"
3981960,3983300," and then we'll be able to"
3983300,3984340," concatenate all of that"
3984340,3986840," so if we have like"
3986840,3988040," several sections"
3988040,3990560," we can try to concatenate them"
3990560,3991200," all of them"
3991200,3993140," maybe"
3993140,3995420," concat"
3995420,3996040," with"
3996040,3997440," this thing"
3997440,3999260," and then maybe"
3999260,4000800," wrap it around"
4000800,4002480," sprint f"
4002480,4003220," with"
4003220,4004800," something like this"
4004800,4005800," hello cozy white bear"
4005800,4006140," welcome"
4006140,4006920," welcome to the string"
4006920,4008320," all right"
4008320,4008920," so"
4008920,4009700," yeah"
4009700,4010500," we're gonna actually"
4010500,4012340," go the show sections route"
4012340,4013940," and because of that"
4013940,4015640," we're gonna do the following thing"
4015640,4016800," we're gonna take the sections"
4016800,4017820," we're gonna"
4017820,4019080," show"
4019080,4019940," sections"
4019940,4020700," and only then"
4020700,4021640," we're gonna just print"
4021640,4022800," and line thingy"
4022800,4024720," we're gonna do"
4024720,4026180," print and line thingy"
4026180,4027460," we'll see how it goes"
4027460,4029360," all right"
4029360,4029960," so"
4029960,4031920," this is gonna be"
4031920,4032720," show section"
4032720,4033260," all right"
4033260,4034200," and if you're showing a section"
4034200,4035260," you're showing it's a name"
4035260,4036020," and you're showing"
4036020,4037520," the pairs"
4037520,4039060," so it's gonna be like this"
4039060,4041600," sec name"
4041600,4042920," and also"
4042920,4043860," show"
4043860,4045060," pairs"
4045060,4046340," show pairs"
4046340,4051760," show pairs"
4051760,4053240," sec pairs"
4053240,4054960," there we go"
4054960,4055980," so this is gonna be"
4055980,4057380," our thing here"
4057380,4058600," but I have to use"
4058600,4059720," sprint f"
4059720,4061500," so it returns a string"
4061500,4063000," there we go"
4063000,4065020," and then I have to implement"
4065020,4066020," show pairs"
4066020,4069160," and it takes"
4069160,4070680," list of pairs"
4070680,4072320," and returns a string"
4072320,4074240," and it's essentially"
4074240,4075280," similar to"
4075280,4077980," share sections"
4077980,4081880," list map"
4081880,4083340," show a single pair"
4083340,4086280," concatenate"
4086280,4089680," I feel like we can"
4089680,4090760," implement like a library"
4090760,4092040," for showing types"
4092040,4092640," and whatnot"
4092640,4094120," that would be actually"
4094120,4094620," pretty cool"
4094620,4097800," our own one"
4097800,4099060," maybe"
4099060,4100260," hello"
4100260,4101280," jv cut"
4101280,4101600," welcome"
4101600,4103000," with welcome"
4103000,4107280," so"
4107280,4109140," print f"
4109140,4110280," s print f"
4110280,4113240," cool"
4113240,4115580," and"
4115580,4116420," we need to implement"
4116420,4117040," the last one"
4117040,4118200," show pair"
4118200,4121640," I'll look at that"
4121640,4122100," link"
4122100,4123640," look at that link"
4123640,4124880," it uses third party"
4124880,4125460," dependencies"
4125460,4126480," so it's a bloat"
4126480,4127280," we're not gonna use it"
4127280,4127720," I'm sorry"
4127720,4128740," I'm sorry"
4128740,4129860," I already said at the beginning"
4129860,4130280," of the stream"
4130280,4131360," we're not using any"
4131360,4132440," over bloated shit"
4132440,4134000," we only depend"
4134000,4135080," on the distribution"
4135080,4135760," of a camel"
4135760,4137320," because all of this shit"
4137320,4138460," is fucking over bloated"
4138460,4139580," they ruin the software"
4139580,4140040," industry"
4140040,4140440," no"
4140440,4141320," fuck that"
4141320,4142000," we implemented"
4142000,4142760," everything ourselves"
4142760,4143320," okay"
4143320,4144520," so"
4144520,4146060," the next thing"
4146060,4146760," so the pair"
4146760,4147740," is just that"
4147740,4148920," and it's gonna be"
4148920,4149720," print f"
4149720,4150600," s print f"
4150600,4152520," it's gonna be s"
4152520,4153100," and s"
4153100,4154300," and it's gonna be p"
4154300,4156620," wait a second"
4156620,4157880," pair is actually"
4157880,4158500," like this"
4158500,4159320," so I can do something"
4159320,4160080," like key value"
4160080,4161960," key value"
4161960,4173000," bloat has been"
4173000,4174180," fucking banned"
4174180,4177240," bloat has been"
4177240,4177880," fucking banned"
4177880,4179940," cheers"
4179940,4181000," let's celebrate"
4181000,4181720," the ban"
4181720,4182400," of the bloat"
4182400,4187540," all right"
4187540,4187980," seems good"
4187980,4190700," I wonder if this shit"
4190700,4191220," even compiles"
4191220,4192180," like the majority"
4192180,4192820," of the code here"
4192820,4193700," is just printing"
4193700,4194400," this thing"
4194400,4195500," Jesus Christ"
4195500,4198220," anyway"
4198220,4199140," so"
4199140,4200560," it doesn't even"
4200560,4200920," compile"
4200920,4201460," because"
4201460,4202480," yeah"
4202480,4203420," it has to be"
4203420,4203900," like this"
4203900,4204840," and show"
4204840,4205780," section"
4205780,4207720," several of them"
4207720,4208700," there we go"
4208700,4209080," cool"
4209080,4212040," yeah"
4212040,4212580," everything seems"
4212580,4213180," to be compiling"
4213180,4213780," so the only"
4213780,4214040," so the only thing"
4214040,4214440," we need to"
4214440,4215420," implement here"
4215420,4215980," right"
4215980,4216280," in"
4216280,4217660," is"
4217660,4219340," essentially"
4219340,4226280," is"
4226280,4226780," essentially"
4226780,4227260," the parser"
4227260,4227680," combinator"
4227680,4228300," right"
4228300,4229400," so for now"
4229400,4229760," maybe"
4229760,4231900," I'm gonna do the following thing"
4231900,4233000," I'm gonna remove the comments"
4233000,4233920," I don't think"
4233920,4234740," right now"
4234740,4235880," implementing comments"
4235880,4236180," is"
4236180,4237420," easy"
4237420,4240860," we're gonna try to implement"
4240860,4245840," we're gonna try to implement"
4245840,4246780," only this syntax"
4246780,4250040," all right"
4250040,4251660," so everything seems to be compiling"
4251660,4252280," and"
4252280,4253780," maybe I should accept"
4253780,4254600," this thing"
4254600,4255780," in the input"
4255780,4257000," in the"
4257000,4258800," command line arguments"
4258800,4259780," we'll see about that"
4259780,4262700," but for now"
4262700,4265140," I should be able to do something like this"
4265140,4267920," yeah"
4267920,4271580," so error happened at zero"
4271580,4273100," not implemented yet"
4273100,4273940," and"
4273940,4275300," I forgot a new line"
4275300,4278140," so yeah"
4278140,4279580," parser combinator is not implemented"
4279580,4280420," error happened at"
4280420,4281740," zero"
4281740,4282740," not implemented yet"
4282740,4283880," so"
4283880,4285120," the most"
4285120,4286380," the two most important"
4286380,4287360," operations"
4287360,4288000," in"
4288000,4289100," parser combinator"
4289100,4289680," are"
4289680,4291920," map"
4291920,4292860," and"
4292860,4293440," bind"
4293440,4294080," and"
4294080,4295040," we're gonna implement them"
4295040,4295360," after"
4295360,4297020," we commit everything"
4297020,4299660," so"
4299660,4301540," let me try to do something"
4301540,4301780," like"
4301780,4302520," gitignore"
4302520,4304700," it's gonna be"
4304700,4305660," we're also gonna ignore"
4305660,4307580," oh"
4307580,4311420," so"
4311420,4312440," there is"
4312440,4313260," a convention"
4313260,4314180," in a camel"
4314180,4315660," for different kinds"
4315660,4316800," of executable files"
4316800,4318060," so"
4318060,4319320," they usually use"
4319320,4320380," .byte"
4320380,4321220," and .native"
4321220,4322380," maybe we should use"
4322380,4322960," the same"
4322960,4324680," convention"
4324680,4326200," so this is"
4326200,4327020," automatically generated"
4327020,4327540," gitignore"
4327540,4328180," by the way"
4328180,4330340," by github"
4330340,4331260," so I just said"
4331260,4332060," that I'm using the camel"
4332060,4333180," and this is what it generated"
4333180,4333560," so"
4333560,4335160," I think it sounds reasonable"
4335160,4336300," why not"
4336300,4337740," so I can just do"
4337740,4338360," native"
4338360,4340780," and this one"
4340780,4341880," is gonna become native"
4341880,4343500," and this one"
4343500,4344060," is gonna become"
4344060,4344560," byte"
4344560,4345560," right"
4345560,4346360," there we go"
4346360,4347160," and"
4347160,4348100," we're gonna build"
4348100,4348920," all of them here"
4348920,4349540," native"
4349540,4350300," byte"
4350300,4352420," let's remove"
4352420,4352840," all of these"
4352840,4353480," executables"
4353480,4354820," and if I try to build"
4354820,4355640," this entire thing"
4355640,4357360," it builds all of them"
4357360,4358220," and all of that"
4358220,4358680," is already"
4358680,4359920," automatically ignored"
4359920,4360400," for us"
4360400,4361000," we don't have to"
4361000,4362000," even worry about it"
4362000,4362800," nice"
4362800,4364000," all right"
4364000,4368160," all right"
4368160,4371940," okay"
4371940,4372700," so what does"
4372700,4373300," this commit"
4373300,4374460," I'm gonna say"
4374460,4375200," ready"
4375200,4375880," set"
4375880,4376460," go"
4376460,4377160," there we go"
4377160,4377780," I'm gonna push that"
4377780,4378480," right into the repo"
4378480,4380500," and the source code"
4380500,4381200," is already available"
4381200,4381740," by the way"
4381740,4385200," so the source code"
4385200,4385760," is already"
4385760,4386740," available"
4386740,4388000," and you can check it out"
4388000,4388200," here"
4388200,4389080," so I'm gonna push"
4389080,4390420," push there"
4390420,4391420," as I actually"
4391420,4392100," implement things"
4392100,4408820," oh shit"
4408820,4411960," which is so"
4411960,4412820," bad"
4412820,4413520," okay"
4413520,4416580," now let's continue"
4416580,4417340," as I already said"
4417340,4418120," the most two"
4418120,4419120," important operations"
4419120,4420120," of parser"
4420120,4420540," combinator"
4420540,4421960," are"
4421960,4424020," map"
4424020,4424900," and bind"
4424900,4426500," so"
4426500,4426940," yeah"
4426940,4427780," oh hello"
4427780,4428360," welcome"
4428360,4429380," welcome to this channel"
4429380,4430620," so"
4430620,4431880," map and bind"
4431880,4433600," so map"
4433600,4435220," is essentially"
4435220,4436680," takes a function"
4436680,4437460," parkour"
4437460,4437860," yes"
4437860,4439200," it's a parser"
4439200,4439660," combinator"
4439660,4440660," of monads"
4440660,4441500," yes"
4441500,4442320," that's what it stands"
4442320,4442580," for"
4442580,4443140," parkour"
4443140,4444520," so function"
4444520,4445520," from a to b"
4445520,4447660," and also"
4447660,4449000," a parser"
4449000,4449980," that"
4449980,4451180," parses a"
4451180,4452080," and if it turns"
4452080,4452560," a parser"
4452560,4453420," that parses b"
4453420,4454460," so essentially"
4454460,4457000," it applies"
4457000,4457980," this function"
4457980,4458920," to the internal"
4458920,4459980," value of parser"
4459980,4461500," to be fair"
4461500,4462840," I'm not really sure"
4462840,4464080," how good of a"
4464080,4465420," name parser"
4465420,4465820," is"
4465820,4466460," sure"
4466460,4467560," I mean that's what it says"
4467560,4468580," in the repo itself"
4468580,4469960," I mean"
4469960,4471180," repo won't lie"
4471180,4472260," yeah"
4472260,4472780," it's a parser"
4472780,4473220," combinator"
4473220,4474340," of monads"
4474340,4475600," so"
4475600,4475940," yeah"
4475940,4476340," that's what"
4476340,4476780," it stands"
4476780,4477200," for"
4477200,4482120," there we go"
4482120,4485000," now"
4485000,4486420," yeah"
4486420,4487780," so what does"
4487780,4488500," parser mean"
4488500,4489020," on the camel"
4489020,4489740," parser"
4489740,4490320," keyword"
4490320,4490900," it's like"
4490900,4491420," the keyword"
4491420,4492060," I never heard"
4492060,4492340," of that"
4492340,4492740," keyword"
4492740,4493180," maybe"
4493180,4494960," maybe they already"
4494960,4495600," have something"
4495600,4496060," for that"
4496060,4497040," lexer"
4497040,4497700," and parser"
4497700,4498280," generators"
4498280,4501980," I see"
4501980,4505540," is that"
4505540,4505780," what they"
4505780,4506540," used it for"
4506540,4508860," keyword"
4508860,4510480," maybe that's"
4510480,4510700," what they"
4510700,4511220," used it for"
4511220,4512020," how can I"
4512020,4512760," create a timer"
4512760,4513580," for an image"
4513580,4514360," to appear"
4514360,4516500," you just"
4516500,4516880," created"
4516880,4517520," I suppose"
4517520,4521580," okay"
4521580,4523820," so I'm"
4523820,4524200," going to rename"
4524200,4524780," it to par"
4524780,4526120," for now"
4526120,4528580," yeah"
4528580,4529040," let's call it"

4856320,4856960," a parkum"
4856960,4857640," and i"

4859540,4860360," 69"
4860360,4862560," yeah"
4862560,4862920," there we"
4862920,4863060," go"
4863060,4863720," and that"
4863720,4864180," gives me"
4864180,4864680," a parser"

4865140,4865460," returns"
4865460,4865980," 69"
4865980,4867460," so then"
4867460,4867940," i can"

4868160,4868920," parkum"
4868920,4869620," map"

4874740,4875120," a parser"
4875120,4875480," that will"
4875480,4875880," return"
4875880,4876480," let's"
4876480,4876820," actually do"
4876820,4877040," it like"
4877040,4877240," that"
4877240,4877500," so it's"
4877500,4877640," going to"
4877640,4877740," be"
4877740,4878240," 68"
4878240,4878680," and then"
4878680,4878820," we"
4878820,4879120," increment"
4879120,4879280," it"

4879540,4879900," return"
4879900,4880740," 69"
4880740,4882380," so we"

4882780,4883360," this parser"
4883360,4883800," combinator"
4883800,4884940," and then"
4884940,4885500," we can have"
4885500,4885840," some sort"
4885840,4886320," of an input"
4886320,4887000," right"
4887000,4887400," input"
4887400,4889580," that we"

4889900,4890320," turn"
4890320,4891160," into input"
4891160,4891580," so we"
4891580,4891800," have to"

4891940,4892160," make"
4892160,4892540," input"
4892540,4893700," and then"
4893700,4893900," we're"
4893900,4894060," going to"
4894060,4894420," pipe it"
4894420,4894920," into that"
4894920,4895300," parser"
4895300,4895740," combinator"
4895740,4896740," and as"

4897900,4898160," us"
4898160,4898800," 69"
4898800,4899580," so"
4899580,4900240," everything"

6033700,6034120," around"
6034120,6035060," so it's"
6035060,6035380," gonna be"
6035380,6035760," error"
6035760,6036800," yeah"
6036800,6037400," I think"
6037400,6037700," it's a little"
6037700,6038060," bit there"
6038060,6038840," yeah"
6038840,6039940," so in"

6044120,6044420," pretty"
6044420,6044720," pretty"
6044720,6045000," cool"

6266260,6266820," instead"
6266820,6267300," it's"
6267300,6267400," going"

6293600,6303820," by the"
6303820,6303980," way"
6303980,6304460," i think"
6304460,6304660," i would"
6304660,6305100," implement"
6305100,6305320," it"
6305320,6305740," more"

6306380,6306800," parser"
6306800,6307220," combinators"
6307220,6308480," because"
6308480,6309700," they have"
6309700,6310060," more"

6311020,6311280," and"
6311280,6311540," stuff"
6311540,6312700," which"
6312700,6313060," my"
6313060,6313400," parser"
6313400,6313720," communities"
6313720,6314020," don't"
6314020,6314220," really"
6314220,6314540," have"
6314540,6317540," so"
6317540,6317840," let me"
6317840,6318140," take a"
6318140,6318260," look"
6318260,6318400," you"
6318400,6318660," also"
6318660,6319160," you"
6319160,6319440," probably"
6319440,6319760," also"
6319760,6320400," parameterize"
6320400,6320620," some"
6320620,6320780," of"
6320780,6320900," the"
6320900,6321080," like"
6321080,6321620," monos"
6321620,6321800," that"
6321800,6321980," can"
6321980,6322120," be"
6322120,6322340," rub"
6322340,6322680," there"
6322680,6324500," yeah"
6324500,6324820," so"
6324820,6325120," you"
6325120,6325460," try"
6325460,6325640," to"
6325640,6325880," implement"
6325880,6326080," like"
6326080,6326400," as"
6326400,6326820," like"
6326820,6327020," as"
6327020,6327540," flexible"
6327540,6327960," over"
6327960,6328380," parsers"
6328380,6328540," as"
6328540,6328940," possible"
6328940,6331920," so"
6331920,6332480," i'm not"
6332480,6333040," very sure"
6333040,6333440," if we're"
6333440,6333620," going to"
6333620,6334140," go that"
6334140,6334480," route"
6334480,6334940," i'm going to"
6334940,6335200," implement"
6335200,6335540," like a"
6335540,6335740," very"
6335740,6336240," specific"
6336240,6336500," like"
6336500,6336700," very"
6336700,6337020," small"
6337020,6337380," parser"
6337380,6337660," community"
6337660,6338080," library"
6338080,6338520," i'm not"
6338520,6338720," going to"
6338720,6339020," try to"
6339020,6339200," make"
6352120,6352420," disaster"
6352420,6352620," yeah"
6352620,6352740," yeah"
6352740,6352820," yeah"
6352820,6352820," yeah"
6352820,6353140," i think"
6353140,6353440," maybe"
6353440,6353760," rust"
6353760,6353920," is"
6353920,6354080," not"
6354080,6354300," really"
6354300,6354780," designed"
6354780,6354980," for"
6354980,6355140," this"
6355140,6355340," kind"
6355340,6355460," of"
6355460,6355720," stuff"
6355720,6362100," all right"
6362100,6363060," so let's"
6363060,6363540," implement all"
6363540,6363760," of that"
6363760,6364280," so essentially"
6364280,6364700," what we need"
6364700,6364880," to do"
6364880,6365120," we need"
6365120,6365580," to chain"
6365580,6366040," these two"
6366040,6366400," parsers"
6366400,6366740," together"
6366740,6367400," and throw"
6367400,6367680," away"
6367680,6368140," the left"
6368140,6368500," value"
6368500,6368740," of the"
6368740,6369100," parser"
6369100,6369340," it's"
6369340,6369860," as simple"
6369860,6370300," as that"
6370300,6370640," nothing"
6370640,6371140," special"
6371140,6373540," so let"
6373540,6373920," me try"
6373920,6375000," so we're"
6375000,6375400," creating a"
6375400,6375900," new parser"
6375900,6377540," that takes"
6377540,6377940," an input"
6377940,6378560," right"
6378560,6379680," and then"
6379680,6381140," we feed"
6381140,6381800," that input"
6381800,6382740," into the"
6382740,6383480," first parser"
6383480,6384020," right"
6384020,6384960," and then we're"
6384960,6385520," checking whether"
6385520,6386180," that succeeded"
6386180,6386700," or not"
6386700,6388700," oh"
6388700,6389260," congratulations"
6389260,6390200," you're"
6390200,6391740," getting"
6391740,6392360," closer to"
6392360,6392660," closer"
6392660,6393260," and closer"
6393260,6393920," to 11"
6393920,6395000," nice"
6395000,6398220," all right"
6398220,6398900," so this is"
6398900,6399420," a keg"
6399420,6400100," and a keg"
6400100,6400760," can return"
6400760,6401180," the next"
6401180,6401560," input"
6401560,6402800," and the"
6402800,6403140," value"
6403140,6403920," that we need"
6403920,6404240," to throw"
6404240,6404560," away"
6404560,6405320," so essentially"
6405320,6405780," i can just"
6405780,6406380," do underscore"
6406380,6407160," here and forget"
6407160,6407580," about it"
6407580,6408180," and just take"
6408180,6408600," the second"
6408600,6409120," parser"
6409120,6409920," and run"
6409920,6410500," that parser"
6410500,6410940," on the"
6410940,6411380," input"
6411380,6411860," and there"
6411860,6412180," you go"
6412180,6412680," i pretty"
6412680,6413680," much implemented"
6413680,6414000," it"
6414000,6415380," so except"
6415380,6416100," i also need"
6416100,6416640," to"
6416640,6418760," check the"
6418760,6419360," error case"
6419360,6419840," and in case"
6419840,6420340," of an error"
6420340,6421100," i just return"
6421100,6421580," the error"
6421580,6422780," nothing special"
6422780,6423620," there we go"
6423620,6424540," that's the entire"
6424540,6425040," implementation"
6425040,6425740," of this operation"
6425740,6426620," you just chain"
6426620,6427280," two parsers"
6427280,6427640," together"
6427640,6428500," and you throw"
6428500,6429140," away the value"
6429140,6429600," of the left"
6429600,6429840," one"
6429840,6430740," super simple"
6430760,6432840," let's"
6432840,6433360," let's see"
6433360,6433900," let's see"
6433900,6434180," let's see"
6434180,6435020," for example"
6435020,6435660," why would you"
6435660,6436120," even need"
6436120,6436640," something like"
6436640,6436920," that"
6436920,6438220," imagine that"
6438220,6438460," you have"
6438460,6438840," an input"
6438840,6439840," like space"
6439840,6440820," and some"
6440820,6441220," word"
6441220,6442240," and you want"
6442240,6443300," to parse"
6443300,6444000," that word"
6444000,6444740," ignoring that"
6444740,6445560," specific space"
6445560,6447140," well you can"
6447140,6447860," easily do that"
6447860,6449080," so let's"
6449080,6450160," turn it into"
6450160,6451520," an input"
6451520,6452500," so make input"
6452500,6453780," and then we're"
6453780,6454140," going to pipe"
6454140,6454580," all of that"
6454580,6455080," in a very"
6455080,6455620," interesting"
6455620,6456180," parser"
6456180,6456440," committee"
6456440,6456760," it's going"
6456760,6456760," it's going"
6456760,6456940," to be"
6456940,6457480," parcum"
6457480,6459820," you know"
6459820,6460120," what"
6460120,6460820," let's do"
6460820,6461280," open"
6461280,6461900," parcum"
6461900,6463160," and that"
6463160,6463760," will import"
6463760,6464400," all of the"
6464400,6464740," symbols"
6464740,6465240," from that"
6465240,6465520," module"
6465520,6466320," into our"
6466320,6467000," current scope"
6467000,6467400," so we don't"
6467400,6467680," have to"
6467680,6467960," prefix"
6467960,6468320," anything"
6468320,6468780," so i can"
6468780,6469160," do something"
6469160,6469460," like"
6469460,6470340," space"
6470340,6470840," word"
6470840,6472040," and then i"
6472040,6472340," can do"
6472340,6473040," something like"
6473040,6474140," make input"
6474140,6475560," and then i can"
6475560,6476480," pipe it into a"
6476480,6477180," parser combinator"
6477180,6478040," and what we're"
6478040,6478340," going to have"
6478340,6478600," we're going to"
6478600,6479360," have prefix"
6479360,6480900," space"
6480900,6481720," so it will"
6481720,6482520," parse this"
6482520,6483360," specific space"
6483360,6485160," and i'm going to"
6485160,6485780," have prefix"
6485780,6486420," word"
6486420,6487960," and then i'm"
6487960,6488360," going to say"
6488360,6489240," ignore the"
6489240,6489800," left one"
6489800,6490740," chain them"
6490740,6491200," together"
6491200,6492260," but ignore"
6492260,6493080," the left one"
6493080,6494180," and return me"
6494180,6494720," the value of"
6494720,6495280," the right one"
6495280,6495740," and this is"
6495740,6496120," what's going to"
6496120,6496360," happen"
6496360,6497960," if you you"
6497960,6498480," know press"
6498480,6499100," enter correctly"
6499100,6500500," and also don't"
6500500,6501260," forget to put"
6501260,6502140," double semicolon"
6502140,6503780," it will say"
6503780,6504400," reference to"
6504400,6504880," undefined"
6504880,6505360," global"
6505360,6506020," parcum"
6506020,6506880," thank you very"
6506880,6507160," much"
6507160,6507900," i'm super"
6507900,6508480," fucking happy"
6508480,6515120," okay so"
6515120,6519540," abidb"
6519540,6521760," no no"
6521760,6522240," no no"
6522240,6522660," no"
6522660,6525280," this operator"
6525280,6526200," by the way"
6526200,6526780," this"
6526780,6528040," you can see"
6528040,6528300," that"
6528300,6530320," this operator"
6530320,6531560," in our case"
6531560,6532300," specifically"
6532300,6533260," actually takes"
6533260,6534200," two parsers"
6534200,6534980," oh wait a"
6534980,6535280," second"
6535280,6536360," yeah it takes"
6536360,6537040," two parsers"
6537040,6543180," yeah so"
6543180,6544040," an id is not"
6544040,6544400," really a"
6544400,6544880," parser"
6544880,6548000," this id is not"
6548000,6548720," really a parser"
6548720,6552260," it's kind of"
6552260,6552680," complicated"
6552680,6553100," in"
6553100,6554620," originally in"
6554620,6555060," Haskell"
6555060,6556100," um"
6556100,6558620," this operator"
6558620,6559340," works"
6559340,6560900," um"
6560900,6564640," it takes"
6564640,6565260," a function"
6565260,6565940," inside of"
6565940,6566360," the left"
6566360,6566880," parser"
6566880,6567480," and applies"
6567480,6568020," it to the"
6568020,6568780," value inside"
6568780,6569460," of the right"
6569460,6569920," parser"
6569920,6570320," that's what"
6570320,6570820," it does"
6570820,6571900," and the"
6571900,6572480," reason why"
6572480,6573440," they did it"
6573440,6573800," like that"
6573800,6574340," so you can"
6574340,6575440," do the"
6575440,6576120," following thing"
6576120,6577040," right"
6577040,6577620," you can"
6577620,6577920," have"
6577920,6578480," parser"
6578480,6578880," one"
6578880,6580380," parser"
6580380,6580820," two"
6580820,6581740," parser"
6581740,6582180," three"
6582180,6583020," and so"
6583020,6583420," on and so"
6583420,6583660," forth"
6583660,6584180," and i didn't"
6584180,6584780," want to go"
6584780,6585440," that route"
6585440,6586620," uh because"
6586620,6587240," that means i"
6587240,6587880," need to implement"
6587880,6589340," like a functor"
6589340,6590300," and applicative"
6590300,6590900," interfaces"
6590900,6591800," and that's"
6591800,6592380," kind of tedious"
6592380,6593060," like it's a lot"
6593060,6593720," of like additional"
6593720,6594140," code"
6594140,6595340," so what i decided"
6595340,6595880," is that i'm"
6595880,6596560," gonna make a"
6596560,6597240," close approximation"
6597240,6598220," and i make"
6598220,6599080," this operation"
6599080,6600240," just chain"
6600240,6601700," two parsers"
6601700,6602720," in sequence"
6602720,6603580," and return"
6603580,6604280," both of the"
6604280,6604680," values"
6604680,6605520," what's funny"
6605520,6606040," is that if"
6606040,6606300," you're gonna"
6606300,6607120," chain several"
6607120,6607660," of them"
6607660,6608560," uh you're"
6608560,6608920," gonna end"
6608920,6609560," up with"
6609560,6610180," um"
6610180,6611760," with a"
6611760,6612160," tuple"
6612160,6613200," of uh"
6613200,6613760," results"
6613760,6614500," that look"
6614500,6615080," like this"
6615080,6616100," right"
6616100,6617820," right"
6617820,6618300," and the more"
6618300,6618960," parsers you"
6618960,6619440," chain"
6619440,6620620," in our"
6620620,6621160," library"
6621160,6621980," the more"
6621980,6622480," like nasty"
6622480,6623140," tuples you're"
6623140,6623520," gonna get"
6623520,6624040," does it"
6624040,6624560," make sense"
6624560,6625340," uh so"
6625340,6625860," it's basically"
6625860,6626820," uh i was"
6626820,6627260," trying to"
6627260,6627820," emulate what"
6627820,6628120," we have"
6628120,6628660," in haskell"
6628660,6629520," but it's"
6629520,6629840," like a"
6629840,6630300," close"
6630300,6630880," approximation"
6630880,6631420," to what"
6631420,6631700," we have"
6631700,6632100," in haskell"
6632100,6632940," because in"
6632940,6633340," case of a"
6633340,6633840," haskell you"
6633840,6634200," would just"
6634200,6634660," put a"
6634660,6635380," function here"
6635380,6636060," that accepts"
6636060,6637020," four arguments"
6637020,6637500," and you"
6637500,6638020," won't have"
6638020,6638500," like a"
6638500,6639120," nested"
6639120,6640040," things here"
6640040,6641300," right so"
6641300,6642260," it's sort"
6642260,6642620," of like a"
6642620,6643140," compromise"
6643140,6644240," that i have"
6644240,6644660," to make"
6644660,6645800," uh"
6645800,6646920," yeah"
6646920,6650840," how does"
6650840,6651180," haskell"
6651180,6651720," flatten it"
6651720,6652080," um"
6652080,6652420," okay"
6652420,6653740," so haskell"
6653740,6654220," flattened it"
6654220,6654560," the following"
6654560,6654900," way"
6654900,6655580," if you take"
6655580,6655820," a look"
6655820,6656140," at the"
6656140,6657680," um"
6657680,6659240," we need"
6659240,6659480," to wait"
6659480,6659700," a little"
6659700,6659900," bit"
6659900,6660780," because"
6660780,6661680," uh"
6661680,6662080," potato"
6662080,6663580," my potato"
6663580,6665940," uh"
6665940,6666280," all right"
6666280,6666680," so we"
6666680,6666960," take a look"
6666960,6667160," at the"
6667160,6667520," operation"
6667520,6668200," in haskell"
6668200,6669180," it's very"
6669180,6669480," interesting"
6669480,6669820," one"
6669820,6670480," it takes"
6670480,6670700," an"
6670700,6671140," applicative"
6671140,6671540," with a"
6671540,6671920," function"
6671920,6672280," on the"
6672280,6672480," left"
6672480,6673360," and"
6673360,6674000," applicative"
6674000,6674540," with a"
6674540,6674800," value"
6674800,6675140," on the"
6675140,6675320," right"
6675320,6676460," so"
6676460,6676880," if you"
6676880,6677180," have"
6677180,6677760," something"
6677760,6678180," like"
6678180,6679080," uh"
6679080,6680000," this"
6680000,6680660," you have"
6680660,6680860," like"
6680860,6681440," two"
6681440,6681980," applicative"
6681980,6682780," let's pretend"
6682780,6683160," that these"
6683160,6683300," two"
6683300,6683760," applicative"
6683760,6684020," are"
6684020,6684540," parsers"
6684540,6685760," right"
6685760,6686880," and to"
6686880,6687760," flatten it"
6687760,6688020," out"
6688020,6688560," you have"
6688560,6688720," to"
6688720,6689200," apply"
6689200,6689960," like"
6689960,6690440," function"
6690440,6690700," like"
6690700,6691020," this"
6691020,6692020," right"
6692020,6693280," so if"
6693280,6693680," you have"
6693680,6694320," more"
6694320,6695360," values"
6695360,6695740," here"
6695740,6696460," just"
6696460,6697040," seven"
6697040,6697760," what"
6697760,6697980," you'll"
6697980,6698180," have"
6698180,6698340," to"
6698340,6698520," do"
6698520,6698780," on"
6698780,6698980," the"
6698980,6699420," right"
6699420,6699960," is"
6699960,6700140," to"
6700140,6700360," have"
6700360,6700520," a"

6700940,6701260," of"
6701260,6701640," three"
6701640,6702300," arguments"

6703640,6703840," them"
6703840,6704100," up"
6704100,6704500," like"
6704500,6704840," that"
6704840,6706500," right"
6706500,6706840," like"
6706840,6707200," every"
6707200,6707720," time"
6707720,6709040," you"
6709040,6709340," add"

6709620,6710000," new"
6710000,6711680," container"
6711680,6712140," here"
6712140,6712820," you have"

6716660,6717060," this"

6719980,6721000," that's"
6721000,6721120," how"
6721120,6721260," it"

6738580,6739620," okay"
6739620,6740060," so I"

7032080,7033420," cool"
7033420,7035520," now"
7035520,7036040," let me"
7036040,7036540," oh by"
7036540,7036760," the way"
7036760,7037120," this is"
7037120,7037260," a"
7037260,7037560," const"
7037560,7038660," this is"

7039100,7039400," const"
7039400,7040600," so"
7040600,7041340," if I"
7041340,7041520," had"
7041520,7041920," const"
7041920,7042700," I could"
7042700,7042820," have"
7042820,7043080," just"
7043080,7044340," done"
7044340,7044640," something"
7044640,7044900," like"
7044900,7045720," const"
7045720,7048060," and I"
7048060,7048320," think I"
7048320,7048600," should be"
7048600,7048880," able to"
7048880,7049260," do that"
7049260,7049680," if I"
7049680,7049960," take a"
7049960,7050140," look at"
7050140,7050240," the"

7053060,7055560," of"
7055560,7056220," kakaml"
7056220,7057980," I think"
7057980,7058320," it has"
7058320,7058900," a module"
7058900,7059540," for"
7059540,7060160," functional"
7060160,7060640," shit"
7060640,7061320," yes"
7061320,7061580," I do"
7061580,7061880," remember"
7061880,7062180," that"
7062180,7062900," oh"
7062900,7063160," there we"
7063160,7063340," go"
7063340,7065300," oh"
7065300,7065680," there we"
7065680,7065860," go"
7065860,7066400," so"
7066400,7066820," yeah"
7066820,7067720," basically"
7067720,7068040," you have"
7068040,7068280," to do"
7068280,7068480," something"
7068480,7068680," like"
7068680,7068920," fun"
7068920,7069320," const"
7069320,7069720," there we"
7069720,7070500," go"
7070500,7071700," const"
7071700,7072040," versus"
7072040,7072360," id"
7072360,7073160," so"
7073160,7074120," they're"
7074120,7075560," they're"
7075560,7075740," not"
7075740,7076200," comparable"
7076200,7076540," they're"
7076540,7076940," different"
7076940,7077380," operations"
7077380,7077740," like"
7077740,7077980," it's"
7077980,7078220," like"
7078220,7079000," multiplication"
7079000,7079740," versus"
7079740,7080820," sum"
7080820,7083720," it's"
7083720,7083920," two"
7083920,7084200," different"
7084200,7084560," things"
7084560,7084920," like"
7084920,7085220," how"
7085220,7085800," we"
7085800,7085960," can"
7085960,7086220," compare"
7086220,7086400," them"
7086400,7086560," like"
7086560,7086720," that"
7086720,7088820," so"
7088820,7095380," all right"
7095380,7096080," let's actually"
7096080,7096360," see"
7096360,7098540," if it does"
7098540,7098900," compile"
7098900,7099780," oh shit"
7099780,7100120," it doesn't"
7100120,7100380," work"
7100380,7104440," oh"
7104440,7107280," so"
7107280,7107540," this"
7107540,7107800," thing"
7107800,7108180," returns"
7108180,7108340," a"
7108340,7108660," pass"
7108660,7109600," no"
7109600,7109820," it"
7109820,7110840," returns"
7110840,7111020," the"
7111020,7111520," results"
7111520,7114100," yeah"
7114100,7114340," so"
7114340,7114480," that"
7114480,7114620," means"
7114620,7114780," we'll"
7114780,7114960," have"
7114960,7115180," to do"
7115180,7115380," something"
7115380,7115580," like"
7115580,7116080," result"
7116080,7116440," map"
7116440,7117020," I see"
7117020,7117500," does"
7117500,7117760," does"
7117760,7118060," work"
7118060,7118480," okay"
7118480,7119040," damn"
7119040,7119280," it"
7119280,7122740," oh"
7122740,7123240," shit"
7123240,7126480," all right"
7126480,7131620," well"
7131620,7132040," it should"
7132040,7132420," work"
7132420,7133000," I suppose"
7133000,7134600," so"
7134600,7135220," you have"
7135220,7136140," map"
7136140,7136880," like"
7136880,7137280," you have"
7137280,7137780," run"
7137780,7138560," you run"
7138560,7138840," it on"
7138840,7139360," an input"
7139360,7139700," and you"
7139700,7139880," get"
7139880,7140680," the result"
7140680,7142320," and you"
7142320,7142820," map it"
7142820,7143340," with this"
7143340,7143800," value"
7143800,7147640," what are"
7147640,7148020," these prime"
7148020,7148420," characters"
7148420,7148980," it's the"
7148980,7149620," same as"
7149620,7150200," in math"
7150200,7151520," have you"
7151520,7151920," noticed"
7151920,7154200," that in"
7154200,7154600," math you"
7154600,7155000," can have"
7155000,7155400," x"
7155400,7155780," you can"
7155780,7156320," have x"
7156320,7156740," prime"
7156740,7157380," or prime"
7157380,7157720," prime"
7157720,7158580," it's the"
7158580,7159100," same thing"
7159100,7159960," they don't"
7159960,7160280," really mean"
7160280,7160660," anything"
7160660,7167880," the result"
7167880,7168320," expression"
7168320,7168920," has type"
7168920,7169400," error"
7169400,7172160," yeah"
7172160,7179320," result"
7179320,7179920," input"
7179920,7183020," yes"
7183020,7184440," so we"
7184440,7184760," have to"
7184760,7185060," be a"
7185060,7185380," little bit"
7185380,7185840," careful"
7185840,7186260," with this"
7186260,7186520," kind of"
7186520,7186700," stuff"
7186700,7186900," okay"
7186900,7187200," so we"
7187200,7187380," cannot"
7187380,7187600," easily"
7187600,7187880," do"
7187880,7188080," that"
7188080,7188460," because"
7188460,7189520," yeah"
7189520,7191260," you'd"
7191260,7191540," have to"
7191540,7191680," do"
7191680,7192180," input"
7192180,7193720," this"
7193720,7194200," and you"
7194200,7194320," will"
7194320,7194600," have to"
7194600,7194940," replace"
7194940,7195100," it"
7195100,7195300," like"
7195300,7195740," this"
7195740,7199020," input"
7199020,7199560," x"
7199560,7199780," I"
7199780,7200000," think"
7200000,7200260," that"
7200260,7200460," will"
7200460,7200840," work"
7200840,7201240," and it"
7201240,7201520," does"
7201520,7202060," in fact"
7202060,7202400," work"
7202400,7202720," would you"
7202720,7203020," look at"
7203020,7203260," that"
7203260,7203620," oh my"
7203620,7204040," god"
7204040,7206340," so let's"
7206340,7206600," actually"
7206600,7207220," reload that"

7209280,7209960," open this"
7209960,7210620," shite"
7210620,7211840," and now"
7211840,7212360," let's take a"
7212360,7212720," look at this"
7212720,7213060," example"
7213060,7213700," okay so I"
7213700,7214020," have a"
7214020,7214700," hello world"
7214700,7215220," string"

7220360,7220760," the left"
7220760,7221020," one"

7222200,7223480," is"
7223480,7224160," world"

7235000,7235340," go to"
7235340,7235480," the"

7253600,7253780," just"
7253780,7254060," do"
7254060,7255020," like"
7255020,7255360," this"

7604560,7604900," I'm doing"
7604900,7605340," right now"
7605340,7605700," here"
7605700,7606120," if you"
7606120,7606380," want to"
7606380,7606740," of course"
7606740,7608300," if you"
7608300,7609080," want to"
7609080,7615380," so I"
7615380,7615740," think"
7615740,7616820," on top"
7616820,7617100," of the"
7617100,7617620," prefix"
7617620,7620000," we"
7620000,7620260," actually"
7620260,7620520," have"
7620520,7621300," already"
7621300,7621820," pretty much"
7621820,7622460," like sufficient"
7622460,7623060," amount of"
7623060,7623540," combinators"
7623540,7623960," you can"
7623960,7624720," map and"
7624720,7625420," bind and"
7625420,7625680," you can"
7625680,7626140," sequentially"
7626140,7626660," combine"
7626660,7627140," all of"
7627140,7627300," them"
7627300,7628780," the only"

7629500,7630080," actually"
7630080,7630560," is"
7630560,7631240," alternative"
7631240,7632160," right"
7632160,7632660," so"
7632660,7633060," essentially"
7633060,7633420," I want"
7633420,7633680," to have"
7633680,7633920," two"

7634440,7635580," p1"

7637060,7637300," want"
7637300,7638500," basically"
7638500,7639360," check them"
7639360,7639960," sequentially"
7639960,7641260," if the"
7641260,7641700," first one"
7641700,7642100," fails"

7642840,7643100," second"
7643100,7643420," one"
7643420,7644300," and so"
7644300,7644580," on and"
7644580,7644960," so forth"
7644960,7645660," you see"
7645660,7645840," what I'm"
7645840,7646000," talking"
7646000,7646320," about"
7646320,7647800," yeah"
7647800,7648320," so let's"
7648320,7648540," actually"
7648540,7648900," implement"
7648900,7649560," like a"

7650880,7651260," combinator"
7651260,7652520," so"
7652520,7655100," so it's"
7655100,7655320," going to"
7655320,7655660," take"
7655660,7656460," parsers"
7656460,7657260," like this"
7657260,7658140," p2"
7658140,7660320," big"
7660320,7660760," parser"
7660760,7661840," and it"
7661840,7662000," will"
7662000,7662200," it's"
7662200,7662440," actually"
7662440,7663080," they have"
7663080,7663340," to have"
7663340,7663660," the same"

7665340,7665600," type"
7665600,7665920," otherwise"
7665920,7666640," it doesn't"
7666640,7666940," work"
7666940,7668160," so"
7668160,7669020," and it's"
7669020,7669200," going to"
7669200,7669820," be like"
7669820,7670300," this"

7672820,7673220," yes"
7673220,7673540," they"
7673540,7673920," actually"
7673920,7674360," stole"

8032680,8032980," developing"
8032980,8033260," today"
8033260,8033720," is called"
8033720,8034240," Parcum"
8034240,8035080," so"
8035080,8035300," it's a"

8038800,8040220," Parcum"
8040220,8043300," okay"
8043300,8044380," so"
8044380,8045740," now"
8045740,8046140," let's"
8046140,8046520," continue"
8046520,8049520," so"

8050000,8050900," autoparsec"
8050900,8051940," so"
8051940,8052480," autoparsec"
8052480,8052740," is"
8052740,8053280," simpler"

8054320,8054760," correctly"

8057860,8058140," so"
8058140,8058480," that's"
8058480,8058680," a little"
8058680,8058800," bit"
8058800,8059060," better"
8059060,8059540," so"
8059540,8059660," it"
8059660,8059840," also"

8061140,8061320," like"
8061320,8061640," that"
8061640,8063340," okay"
8063340,8064620," cool"
8064620,8065460," simple"
8065460,8067460," I approve"
8067460,8068680," but we're"
8068680,8068980," still gonna"

8069580,8079980," so"
8079980,8080500," now"
8080500,8081420," I'm gonna"
8081420,8082020," do that"

8104880,8106660," yep"
8106660,8107940," so it's"
8107940,8108180," gonna be"

8157600,8158340," what's"
8158340,8158820," yeah"
8158820,8159180," maybe"
8159180,8160080," something"
8160080,8160340," there"
8160340,8160620," s"

8163580,8164160," s"
8164160,8168540," yeah"
8168540,8170600," so"
8170600,8170940," what do"
8170940,8171200," you guys"
8171200,8171660," prefer"
8171660,8172440," s"
8172440,8172920," or"
8172920,8173500," s"
8173500,8176560," the"
8176560,8177000," choice"
8177000,8177260," is"
8177260,8177760," yours"

8180160,8180920," error"
8180920,8182700," text"
8182700,8183900," all right"
8183900,8184500," so this"
8184500,8184780," is gonna"
8184780,8185060," be like"
8185060,8185420," this"
8185420,8186420," and that's"
8186420,8187040," pretty horrible"
8187040,8187480," not gonna"
8187480,8187780," lie"
8187780,8188880," maybe because"
8188880,8189160," if I go"
8189160,8189740," the semicolon"
8189740,8190100," here"
8190100,8192000," why are"
8192000,8192320," you doing"
8192320,8192740," that to"
8192740,8192920," me"
8192920,8193220," like"
8193220,8193400," could"
8193400,8193520," you"
8193520,8193840," just"
8193840,8195260," emax"
8195260,8195820," is"
8195820,8196480," so"
8196480,8197040," be"
8197040,8197380," bigger"
8197380,8199160," emax"
8199160,8199500," is"
8199500,8199840," be"
8199840,8200140," bigger"
8200140,8202900," so also"
8202900,8203160," let me"
8203160,8203420," take a"
8203420,8203540," look"
8203540,8204100," expect"
8204100,8204460," it"
8204460,8206340," so"
8206340,8208720," ah"
8208720,8209700," like this"
8209700,8210740," so this"
8210740,8211120," is basically"
8211120,8211400," what we're"
8211400,8211700," gonna have"
8211700,8211940," here"
8211940,8213020," and"
8213020,8214040," it's"
8214040,8214260," actually"
8214260,8214460," not"
8214460,8214720," text"
8214720,8214920," it's"
8214920,8215120," actually"
8215120,8215660," description"
8215660,8216640," right"
8216640,8218940," so"
8218940,8219740," the"
8219740,8219960," reason"
8219960,8220140," why"
8220140,8220240," I'm"
8220240,8220400," doing"
8220400,8220520," it"

8220640,8220840," that"
8220840,8221120," you're"
8221120,8221160," gonna"
8221160,8221360," see"
8221360,8221620," soon"
8221620,8222360," let's"
8222360,8222600," actually"
8222600,8222840," load"
8222840,8223200," everything"
8223200,8223840," and"
8223840,8224380," open"
8224380,8225260," like"
8225260,8225600," this"
8225600,8226120," and"
8226120,8226760," yeah"
8226760,8227600," so"
8227600,8229040," hello"
8229040,8230140," seems"
8230140,8230400," good"

8247120,8247880," and"
8247880,8248320," then"
8248320,8248600," we can"
8248600,8248780," do"
8248780,8249040," something"
8249740,8250040," it's"

8321620,8321840," actually"

8327400,8327520," the"
8327520,8327840," possible"
8328120,8328420," here"
8328420,8328600," like"
8328600,8328700," I"
8328700,8328900," really"
8328900,8329060," want"

8329160,8329320," see"

8332120,8332640," so"
8332640,8332820," this"
8332820,8332940," is"
8332940,8333060," what"
8333060,8333160," they"
8333160,8333280," want"
8333280,8333360," to"
8333360,8333580," see"
8333580,8336880," so"
8336880,8338280," far"
8338280,8338540," like"
8338540,8338820," this"
8338820,8338960," is"
8338960,8339220," probably"
8339220,8339540," a"
8339540,8339740," good"
8339740,8340160," choice"
8340160,8340380," but"
8340380,8340520," then"
8340520,8340720," later"
8340720,8340900," we'll"
8340900,8341060," have"
8341060,8341180," to"
8341180,8341340," do"
8341340,8341580," something"
8341580,8341840," about"
8341840,8342060," it"
8342060,8343100," all"
8343100,8343260," right"
8343260,8343860," so"
8343860,8344740," let's"
8344740,8345140," recompile"
8345140,8345580," everything"
8345580,8347220," making"
8347220,8347460," good"
8347460,8347680," error"
8347680,8348160," messages"
8348160,8348480," seems"
8348480,8348720," hard"
8348720,8348900," of"
8348900,8349220," course"
8349220,8350700," of"
8350700,8350900," course"
8350900,8351060," it"
8351060,8351200," is"
8351200,8351520," hard"
8351520,8355940," that's"
8355940,8356120," no"
8356120,8356560," that's"
8356560,8356700," why"
8356700,8357000," nobody"
8357000,8357300," does"
8357300,8357520," that"
8357520,8359320," all"
8359320,8359520," right"
8359520,8360740," so"
8360740,8361880," implement"
8361880,8363640," alternative"
8363640,8366420," parser"
8366420,8367780," combinator"
8367780,8369280," all right"
8369280,8370920," so I'm going to push that right into the repo"
8370920,8374380," and I think we need to implement the last one"
8374380,8376980," the last important parser"
8376980,8381860," before we can actually try to apply this library to"
8381860,8384380," like to production or something"
8384380,8387680," so we already implemented a lot of stuff here"
8387680,8390440," so but it's like one-handed lines of code"
8390440,8399020," I failed once typing to implement parser committers on camp because its type system was to prepare to understand my way to dank types"
8399020,8400520," I see"
8400520,8403940," that's why I actually keep the whole parser committers on the parser committers simple here"
8403940,8405600," so they just have input"
8405600,8409400," error and the result of the parsing"
8409400,8410060," and that's it"
8410060,8413020," so I'm not trying to make it super flexible or anything"
8413020,8414040," it's just super simple"
8414040,8426180," so I need something like prefix"
8426180,8428560," I need something like prefix"
8428560,8432740," something like prefix"
8432740,8440220," but it should take instead of string a function from character to boolean"
8440220,8443640," we call such functions predicates"
8443640,8447040," we call such functions predicates"
8447040,8448900," and it should return a string parser"
8448900,8452720," so essentially it basically parses character until this predicate is true"
8452720,8456060," and then it stops and returns what it parsed"
8456060,8457840," so it's based on the predicate"
8457840,8461980," so that's a good name for a function by the way"
8461980,8463320," but I don't know how to call it yet"
8463320,8463820," I'm sorry"
8463820,8467340," maybe something like parse while"
8467340,8470700," yeah"
8470700,8472000," could be"
8472000,8474060," parse while"
8474060,8476540," yeah"
8476540,8477960," parse while"
8477960,8478560," why not"
8478560,8489520," yeah the variable that gets set when a collision happens XD"
8489520,8492300," this is like a real variable in one of my games"
8492300,8493260," like it's a real name"
8493260,8494060," that's there"
8494060,8497620," so yeah"
8497620,8501440," now how are we going to do all of that"
8501440,8503500," so here's the parser"
8503500,8504580," so it accepts an input"
8504580,8507140," and what we're going to do here"
8507140,8507800," is"
8507800,8509480," use"
8509480,8512480," as fast of a code as possible"
8512480,8512980," right"
8512980,8514100," so because"
8514100,8514820," like"
8514820,8516760," trying to find a prefix"
8516760,8518440," while predicates is true"
8518440,8521060," is pretty much an imperative problem"
8521060,8523640," so why not just go ahead"
8523640,8525400," and solve it imperatively"
8525400,8528440," so we can have a mutable variable called i"
8528440,8530600," that contains the index"
8530600,8534460," and while"
8534460,8537280," string get"
8537280,8540500," input text i"
8540500,8544720," this thing is true"
8544720,8546140," while this entire thing is true"
8546140,8551540," we increment i"
8551540,8553760," here's an interesting thing"
8553760,8555040," so yeah by the way"
8555040,8556700," in a camel you can have a mutable variables"
8556700,8557920," so they're called references"
8557920,8559940," it creates like a mutable cell"
8559940,8562720," so you can mutate it"
8562720,8565340," and there's a special function called incur"
8565340,8567580," which takes"
8567580,8570120," integer inside of a reference"
8570120,8571400," and increments it"
8571400,8573520," so you can define something like this"
8573520,8574400," it's going to be ref zero"
8574400,8575700," right"
8575700,8577380," so if you take a look at x"
8577380,8579240," it doesn't make much sense"
8579240,8581000," you have to actually dereference it like that"
8581000,8582640," so you dereference with"
8582640,8584640," like a bang in front of the variable"
8584640,8586340," so if you do incur x"
8586340,8588720," and if you take a look at it"
8588720,8590560," so it becomes one"
8590560,8591200," so"
8591200,8592300," yeah"
8592300,8598400," so as somebody actually mentioned in"
8598400,8599340," in the chat"
8599340,8602080," a camel is basically has killed with cheats"
8602080,8602860," so"
8602860,8604980," you can have immutable variables"
8604980,8605800," like right away"
8605800,8607400," and you can have while loops"
8607400,8608380," so"
8608380,8609020," yeah"
8609020,8610300," and on top of that"
8610300,8613120," i think we also need to add like additional condition here"
8613120,8614660," also"
8614660,8618700," and"
8618700,8621880," i is less than n"
8621880,8622820," where n"
8622820,8625120," is the size of the input"
8625120,8626060," so it's going to be"
8626060,8627740," a string length"
8627740,8629920," input text in"
8629920,8630600," there we go"
8630600,8631460," something like this"
8631460,8631900," you see"
8631900,8632320," you see"
8632320,8634960," so when we keep incrementing this i"
8634960,8636200," until the predicate is true"
8636200,8637340," and after we're done"
8637340,8638820," and we do all of that"
8638820,8639780," in a while loop"
8639780,8641640," without any recursive calls"
8641640,8642680," without anything"
8642680,8643800," you just want to do a loop"
8643800,8644960," you just fucking do a loop"
8644960,8645740," seriously"
8645740,8646860," that's how cool it is"
8646860,8651120," so a camel is basically python 5"
8651120,8651480," yes"
8651480,8653200," that's basically what it is"
8653200,8654820," so"
8654820,8656820," and as i also said"
8656820,8657900," a camel is a language"
8657900,8659840," that syntactically pretends"
8659840,8661220," to be a functional one"
8661220,8661940," but in reality"
8661940,8663000," it's just straight up python"
8663000,8664040," but it's a python"
8664040,8665140," with a static typing"
8665140,8666000," and"
8666000,8668580," that compiles to native code"
8668580,8669860," can you python do that"
8669860,8672140," can you python do that"
8672140,8672980," i don't think so"
8672980,8674740," and this shit is way faster than python"
8674740,8675280," trust me"
8675280,8677300," so"
8677300,8680420," so i"
8680420,8681500," at this point"
8681500,8682820," should point at something"
8682820,8683940," that"
8683940,8686620," fingers so close"
8686620,8687300," i can't damn it"
8687300,8688080," i didn't notice that"
8688080,8690720," was it too close"
8690720,8691200," was it"
8691200,8692040," yeah it was too close"
8692040,8694000," i wasn't looking on my abs"
8694000,8694620," when i did that"
8694620,8694860," so"
8694860,8696860," right"
8696860,8697980," so what we're gonna do here"
8697980,8699280," we'll have to take a substring"
8699280,8700000," actually we're gonna do"
8700000,8700740," input sub"
8700740,8702260," input"
8702260,8703640," sub"
8703640,8705580," starting from i"
8705580,8706220," no"
8706220,8707340," we're gonna start from zero"
8707340,8708180," then"
8708180,8709800," this is how much"
8709800,8710460," we're gonna take"
8710460,8711980," and we're gonna apply that"
8711980,8712960," to the input"
8712960,8714100," right"
8714100,8716360," but that's only gonna give us"
8716360,8717020," the prefix"
8717020,8718420," that we're supposed to return"
8718420,8719040," right"
8719040,8722540," that's only gonna give us"
8722540,8722960," the prefix"
8722960,8724380," that we're supposed to return"
8724380,8728720," all right"
8728720,8732020," maybe because of that"
8732020,8732760," we want to do something"
8732760,8733440," like string"
8733440,8734020," sub"
8734020,8735520," and we want to apply that"
8735520,8736460," to the input text"
8736460,8737280," because that's"
8737280,8737940," that's the prefix"
8737940,8739160," that we're returning"
8739160,8741680," that's the prefix"
8741680,8742400," we are returning"
8742400,8745900," a camel module"
8745900,8746360," sql"
8746360,8747480," ppego type classes"
8747480,8748480," sort of"
8748480,8749320," i mean"
8749320,8751160," you can replace type classes"
8751160,8752700," with a camel modules"
8752700,8753040," so"
8753040,8754420," they do their job"
8754420,8756080," that's for sure"
8756080,8758740," what is"
8758740,8760360," exclamation wide part"
8760360,8761100," so"
8761100,8762080," i"
8762080,8763580," is a reference"
8763580,8765500," this is dereferencing"
8765500,8766080," the referencing"
8766080,8767520," and getting the zero"
8767520,8769040," the value inside of"
8769040,8769280," reference"
8769280,8769860," it's not zero"
8769860,8770560," because we're"
8770560,8771380," incriminating it"
8771380,8773120," yes"
8773120,8774120," i told you"
8774120,8774940," it's an imperative"
8774940,8775600," language"
8775600,8776780," it's a straight up"
8776780,8777700," imperative language"
8777700,8778480," seriously"
8778480,8786180," yeah"
8786180,8786720," pointers"
8786720,8791660," all right"
8791660,8793140," so"
8793140,8795700," this is what we have"
8795700,8795980," here"
8795980,8797040," and i have to also"
8797040,8797960," parse the rest of the"
8797960,8798220," input"
8798220,8799220," input sub"
8799220,8799220," input sub"
8799220,8804840," it's actually"
8804840,8805920," something like this"
8805920,8806980," we're starting"
8806980,8808340," from this"
8808340,8810000," and i need to take"
8810000,8810940," n minus"
8810940,8811760," this"
8811760,8812960," values"
8812960,8815640," n minus"
8815640,8816500," this values"
8816500,8817200," and"
8817200,8818920," i'll have to"
8818920,8819560," provide the input"
8819560,8819820," here"
8819820,8820500," so this is going to"
8820500,8821120," be the rest of the"
8821120,8821420," input"
8821420,8824460," and"
8824460,8825280," let's see if this"
8825280,8825660," compiles"
8825660,8826640," it doesn't compile"
8826640,8827360," because"
8827360,8828820," yeah i have to"
8828820,8829400," dereference it"
8829400,8829960," all the time"
8829960,8830940," now it compiles"
8830940,8831820," so this entire thing"
8831820,8832120," compiles"
8832120,8833260," so just"
8833260,8834180," essentially"
8834180,8835260," you have a string"
8835260,8836300," right"
8836300,8837400," one two three"
8837400,8837800," four"
8837800,8838400," hello"
8838400,8839260," and you have a"
8839260,8840080," predicate something like"
8840080,8840500," is digit"
8840500,8841960," so what this code does"
8841960,8843720," it goes from left to right"
8843720,8844220," checking"
8844220,8845820," is this predicate true"
8845820,8846620," for that character"
8846620,8847960," is this predicate true"
8847960,8848520," for that one"
8848520,8848940," is it true"
8848940,8849520," for that one"
8849520,8850320," so on and so forth"
8850320,8850920," and it stops"
8850920,8851500," when it finds"
8851500,8852780," the character"
8852780,8854180," where this predicate"
8854180,8854760," is not true"
8854760,8856120," and just splits"
8856120,8857400," like this"
8857400,8858440," and wraps all of that"
8858440,8859300," into a parser"
8859300,8860080," so"
8860080,8861020," and yeah"
8861020,8861800," i just implement it"
8861800,8862620," in the most imperative"
8862620,8863300," way possible"
8863300,8863820," it's just while"
8863820,8864500," why not"
8864500,8867340," want to do while loop"
8867340,8868300," you can do that"
8868300,8870700," so"
8870700,8873520," we could probably"
8873520,8874640," simplify that a little bit"
8874640,8874840," but"
8874840,8876580," anyways"
8876580,8878140," everything seems to be"
8878140,8878520," compiling"
8878520,8878920," and"
8878920,8879680," let me see"
8879680,8880380," do we even have"
8880380,8881460," like such predicates"
8881460,8882580," is there something like"
8882580,8883540," char"
8883540,8885240," digit"
8885240,8889080," uppercase"
8889080,8891440," is there anything there"
8891440,8894660," well"
8894660,8895540," we can implement it"
8895540,8895980," ourself"
8895980,8897820," so"
8897820,8898420," ref is just"
8898420,8898880," c++"
8898880,8899480," new"
8899480,8901240," well"
8901240,8901760," c++"
8901760,8902020," new"
8902020,8902680," also calls a"
8902680,8903160," constructor"
8903160,8904300," I think"
8904300,8906300," char uppercase"
8906300,8907040," char uppercase"
8907040,8907760," converts to"
8907760,8908280," lowercase"
8908280,8909000," I need a predicate"
8909000,8914140," I like optional"
8914140,8914920," function programming"
8914920,8915680," just let me do"
8915680,8916140," a loop"
8916140,8916640," if I want"
8916640,8916820," yeah"
8916820,8917560," well speaking of"
8917560,8918180," we also need to"
8918180,8918980," implement optional"
8918980,8920520," we need to implement"
8920520,8921080," optional"
8921080,8923080," that takes a predicate"
8923080,8925500," a"
8925500,8926700," parser"
8926700,8928080," it's not a predicate"
8928080,8928440," parser"
8928440,8929080," it takes a parser"
8929080,8929580," and returns"
8929580,8931480," a parser"
8931480,8932520," that"
8932520,8933440," optionally"
8933440,8933980," contains"
8933980,8934880," this value"
8934880,8936800," fail with"
8936800,8937280," so"
8937280,8938300," essentially"
8938300,8939100," we allow"
8939100,8940600," that value"
8940600,8941320," to be missing"
8941320,8941900," right"
8941900,8942820," so that's what we do"
8942820,8944140," to do"
8944140,8945440," optional"
8945440,8946600," parser"
8946600,8947440," is not"
8947440,8948020," implemented"
8948020,8949960," there we go"
8949960,8953280," optional parser"
8953280,8954160," is not implemented"
8954160,8968880," you can define"
8968880,8969780," is alpha"
8969780,8971360," I can define"
8971360,8971960," a lot of things"
8971960,8972740," the question is not"
8972740,8973560," whether I can define"
8973560,8973900," something"
8973900,8974320," or"
8974320,8975460," the question is"
8975460,8975980," whether do I"
8975980,8976640," already have"
8976640,8977020," something"
8977020,8978280," that I can use"
8978280,8979180," so that's what"
8979180,8980200," the question we have"
8980200,8981220," okay let's actually"
8981220,8982180," define is digit"
8982180,8983460," is digit"
8983460,8985940," and"
8985940,8986920," can I compare"
8986920,8987600," characters"
8987600,8988460," so for example"
8988460,8989120," can I do something"
8989120,8989480," like"
8989480,8990660," one"
8990660,8992060," I can"
8992060,8993000," so and then"
8993000,8993720," if I do something"
8993720,8994480," like six"
8994480,8995860," so that's actually"
8995860,8996340," pretty cool"
8996340,8997400," and"
8997400,9000700," you can use"
9000700,9001200," match"
9001200,9006720," thank you"
9006720,9009260," is digit"
9009260,9010440," x"
9010440,9011240," and"
9011240,9013140," we're gonna"
9013140,9013580," check"
9013580,9015460," that this thing"
9015460,9016800," less or equal"
9016800,9018000," and"
9018000,9018780," this"
9018780,9019880," is less or equal"
9019880,9020540," than nine"
9020540,9021440," right"
9021440,9022120," and we can easily"
9022120,9022680," check whether"
9022680,9023640," something is a digit"
9023640,9024600," like this"
9024600,9025600," is this a digit"
9025600,9026900," ah shit"
9026900,9028560," it is a digit"
9028560,9029800," is this a digit"
9029800,9030780," it is not a digit"
9030780,9031140," you see"
9031140,9031980," as simple as that"
9031980,9032760," now"
9032760,9033740," I'm gonna have an input"
9033740,9034600," one two three"
9034600,9035600," for hello"
9035600,9036840," and then I'm gonna"
9036840,9037640," turn it into"
9037640,9039520," an input"
9039520,9040800," and then"
9040800,9041360," I'm gonna"
9041360,9042160," have something"
9042160,9042800," like parse"
9042800,9043900," oh shit"
9043900,9044620," I didn't recompile"
9044620,9045020," anything"
9045020,9045820," god damn it"
9045820,9046660," alright"
9046660,9047520," so"
9047520,9048380," load"
9048380,9050340," open"
9050340,9053760," one two three"
9053760,9054020," one two three four"
9054020,9054520," hello"
9054520,9056640," make"
9056640,9057500," input"
9057500,9060140," parse"
9060140,9060940," while"
9060940,9063300," and"
9063300,9068080," oh boy"
9068080,9068560," oh boy"
9068560,9071280," oh boy"
9071280,9071660," oh boy"
9071660,9072720," where is my"
9072720,9073120," soy"
9073120,9075660," there we go"
9075660,9077420," is digit"
9077420,9077420," is digit"
9077420,9080620," run"
9080620,9082860," there we go"
9082860,9084620," so here's the input"
9084620,9085840," we're parsing"
9085840,9086700," while is digit"
9086700,9088380," so what we got here"
9088380,9089880," is one two three four"
9089880,9090960," hello"
9090960,9093540," so"
9093540,9094940," we can even do"
9094940,9095840," like a combinators"
9095840,9097180," so in something like"
9097180,9097680," prefix"
9097680,9098700," hello"
9098700,9101660," so we basically split"
9101660,9102780," one two three four"
9102780,9103500," and hello"
9103500,9103980," apart"
9103980,9104960," and I can even"
9104960,9106040," add more digits"
9106040,9106360," here"
9106360,9107480," and it will"
9107480,9108640," properly parse them"
9108640,9110440," and split them apart"
9110440,9112200," so and I can combine"
9112200,9113580," them as much as I want"
9113580,9116160," so it's very cool"
9116160,9125680," so"
9125680,9128280," I think we're ready"
9128280,9129420," to do a committee"
9129420,9130340," committee for this thing"
9130340,9132820," and that algorithm"
9132820,9133500," by the way"
9133500,9135440," for parse while"
9135440,9136560," is extremely fast"
9136560,9138160," because I'm pretty sure"
9138160,9139800," at the assembly level"
9139800,9140740," it will turn into"
9140740,9142040," just like a regular loop"
9142040,9143320," with just a label"
9143320,9144640," and jump to label"
9144640,9145420," it's not going to be"
9145420,9145860," like some"
9145860,9146180," you know"
9146180,9146680," fancy"
9146680,9148580," trampolines"
9148580,9151220," or tail recursion calls"
9151220,9152660," with reusing frames"
9152660,9153320," and shit like that"
9153320,9153780," no it's just"
9153780,9154380," an imperative"
9154380,9155260," fucking code"
9155260,9156200," that compiles down"
9156200,9157380," to a very efficient"
9157380,9157780," assembly"
9157780,9158720," and it's wrapped"
9158720,9159560," into a functional"
9159560,9160040," programming"
9160040,9161420," like objects"
9161420,9162980," that's combinable"
9162980,9163620," with functional"
9163620,9164420," programming operations"
9164420,9165680," so if you want to"
9165680,9166440," do something fast"
9166440,9167260," you can just do"
9167260,9167860," something fast"
9167860,9168920," it's cool"
9168920,9170720," don't worry about it"
9170720,9171720," that's what I like"
9171720,9172280," about the camel"
9172280,9173560," at any point"
9173560,9174160," you can just say"
9174160,9174640," fuck it"
9174640,9175160," and program"
9175160,9175820," like in C"
9175820,9176480," or whatever"
9176480,9179100," but no use recursion"
9179100,9180480," I could probably"
9180480,9181160," I wonder how it"
9181160,9181600," optimizes"
9181600,9182520," like a recursive tail"
9182520,9182840," calls"
9182840,9183460," does it also"
9183460,9183980," optimize them"
9183980,9184360," down to"
9184360,9184720," like"
9184720,9185500," you know"
9185500,9186020," like a regular"
9186020,9186300," loop"
9186300,9186780," probably"
9186780,9188460," disassemble it"
9188460,9189420," alright"
9189420,9190580," so I think"
9190580,9192820," godbolt supports"
9192820,9193300," a camel"
9193300,9193980," we can take a look"
9193980,9194660," at what it generates"
9194660,9195480," when you have a loop"
9195480,9196080," like that"
9196080,9197660," so let me quickly"
9197660,9198300," write one"
9198300,9199200," it's gonna be"
9199200,9199880," tooregmod"
9199880,9200920," and"
9200920,9202960," so if I do"
9202960,9203560," something like"
9203560,9203940," i"
9203940,9205660," ref 0"
9205660,9206740," and then"
9206740,9207360," while"
9207360,9208940," i is less"
9208940,9209880," than 100"
9209880,9211020," then I'm gonna do"
9211020,9212480," incur i"
9212480,9213640," right"
9213640,9214300," and then I'm gonna"
9214300,9214840," print"
9214840,9215860," let's not print"
9215860,9216200," anything"
9216200,9216960," because it may"
9216960,9217560," actually ruin"
9217560,9218000," assembly"
9218000,9220200," and done"
9220200,9222220," so I wonder"
9222220,9222880," if it's gonna"
9222880,9223760," compile down"
9223760,9224320," to something"
9224320,9226240," so"
9226240,9227660," kakamel"
9227660,9228700," here's the kakamel"
9228700,9231900," and"
9231900,9233900," actually it doesn't"
9233900,9234760," have that much"
9234760,9235360," of a code"
9235360,9237920," alright"
9237920,9238760," let's actually print"
9238760,9239340," something because"
9239340,9240300," I think it optimized"
9240300,9241440," everything away"
9241440,9242480," and the line"
9242480,9245280," oh I have an idea"
9245280,9247100," so we're gonna do"
9247100,9247800," something like"
9247800,9249320," string of"
9249320,9249820," int"
9249820,9251320," print"
9251320,9252120," and line"
9252120,9253000," so let's see"
9253000,9253680," how it's gonna go"
9253680,9255560," will that be"
9255560,9256600," super efficient"
9256600,9258360," alright"
9258360,9261560," where is the"
9261560,9262560," loops"
9262560,9264680," did you see"
9264680,9265120," roots"
9265120,9270920," we can see"
9270920,9271700," the start"
9271700,9273360," so let me find"
9273360,9274440," the print"
9274440,9275660," and the line"
9275660,9276620," so here's the"
9276620,9277100," print and line"
9277100,9277580," this is where"
9277580,9278160," we call it"
9278160,9279220," yeah so this is"
9279220,9279800," with sequential"
9279800,9280560," we call a"
9280560,9281240," string of int"
9281240,9281700," and then"
9281700,9282800," like this"
9282800,9283740," and then"
9283740,9284260," we jump"
9284260,9285160," back to"
9285160,9286080," 103"
9286080,9287940," oh here's"
9287940,9288160," loop"
9288160,9289460," this is literally"
9289460,9290200," the whole loop"
9290200,9291120," right"
9291120,9292680," seriously"
9292680,9295320," oh shit"
9295320,9295740," it uses"
9295740,9296400," registers"
9296400,9299920," it literally"
9299920,9299920," it literally"
9299920,9300800," uses registers"
9300800,9301400," for this shit"
9301400,9301920," it doesn't even"
9301920,9302500," use memory"
9302500,9303320," like it's just"
9303320,9303920," like actually"
9303920,9304540," compiled down"
9304540,9305280," to very efficient"
9305280,9305620," fucking"
9305620,9306000," assembly"
9306000,9307760," look at that"
9307760,9308100," loop"
9308100,9308980," seriously"
9308980,9311200," okay it checks"
9311200,9311760," the condition"
9311760,9312480," and then this is"
9312480,9313040," out of the"
9313040,9313480," condition"
9313480,9314700," and that it"
9314700,9315100," adds"
9315100,9315840," yeah this is"
9315840,9316340," actually very"
9316340,9316620," cool"
9316620,9318060," so"
9318060,9319840," and on top of"
9319840,9320460," that you can"
9320460,9321640," then wrap it"
9321640,9322100," into pure"
9322100,9322600," functional"
9322600,9323000," code"
9323000,9324040," so"
9324040,9329560," yeah but"
9329560,9330160," Okaml also"
9330160,9331060," has its own"
9331060,9331360," bullshit"
9331360,9331980," especially when"
9331980,9332420," it comes to"
9332420,9332940," infrastructure"
9332940,9333480," and stuff like"
9333480,9333900," that you know"
9333900,9334420," remember how"
9334420,9334940," many like"
9334940,9336160," different file"
9336160,9336660," types it"
9336660,9336960," has"
9336960,9337700," like"
9337700,9338840," ml"
9338840,9339760," mli"
9339760,9341260," cmo"
9341260,9342780," cmi"
9342780,9343800," cmx"
9343800,9344860," cmxa"
9344860,9345860," cma"
9345860,9350700," why does"
9350700,9351060," it add"
9351060,9351400," 2"
9351400,9352140," if it"
9352140,9352820," increments"
9352820,9353340," that's a"
9353340,9353940," good question"
9353940,9355580," I have no"
9355580,9355900," idea"
9355900,9362180," well is it"
9362180,9362580," really a"
9362580,9362860," value"
9362860,9363840," yes it is"
9363840,9364180," value"
9364180,9367080," now write"
9367080,9367940," a recursive"
9367940,9368480," version for"
9368480,9368860," comparison"
9368860,9369360," I'm too"
9369360,9369820," lazy I'm"
9369820,9370100," sorry"
9370100,9371660," but yeah"
9371660,9374300," it's kind of"
9374300,9374740," is it really"
9374740,9375620," 2 or is it"
9375620,9376280," referring to"
9376280,9376700," some"
9376700,9377700," address or"
9377700,9378100," something"
9378100,9382960," ok"
9382960,9384500," alright"
9384500,9385240," let's continue"
9385240,9391040," so"
9391040,9392080," implement"
9392080,9398380," yeah it's"
9398380,9398840," doing something"
9398840,9399220," weird"
9399220,9399940," but"
9399940,9401200," yeah"
9401200,9406900," maybe it's"
9406900,9407060," good"
9407060,9407300," bold"
9407300,9407540," that"
9407540,9407720," it's"
9407720,9407900," doing"
9407900,9408240," something"
9408240,9408500," weird"
9408500,9408980," who knows"
9408980,9413280," parcum"
9413280,9414760," ml"
9414760,9416420," so we need to"
9416420,9416820," implement an"
9416820,9417400," optional by the"
9417400,9417640," way"
9417640,9418260," we need to"
9418260,9418660," implement an"
9418660,9418900," option"
9418900,9419620," so basically"
9419620,9420420," if the"
9420420,9420820," parser"
9420820,9421020," the"
9421020,9421480," underline"
9421480,9421920," parser"
9421920,9422360," fails"
9422360,9423480," it shouldn't"
9423480,9423880," fail"
9423880,9424320," it should"
9424320,9424560," just"
9424560,9425320," return an"
9425320,9425660," optional"
9425660,9426120," thing"
9426120,9428460," yeah"
9428460,9431480," so this"
9431480,9431700," is how"
9431700,9431980," we're gonna"
9431980,9432540," do that"
9432540,9433740," run"
9433740,9434880," fun"
9434880,9435500," input"
9435500,9438100," so and"
9438100,9438700," match"
9438700,9439420," p1"
9439420,9440340," run"
9440340,9440820," input"
9440820,9441860," with"
9441860,9442740," so if"
9442740,9442900," it's"
9442900,9443420," successful"
9443420,9444140," right"
9444140,9444520," if it's"
9444520,9444960," successful"
9444960,9448680," I think"
9448680,9448960," we can"
9448960,9449160," just"
9449160,9449660," return"
9449660,9451260," the"
9451260,9451560," result"
9451560,9451820," then"
9451820,9453240," right"
9453240,9454700," if it's"
9454700,9454900," not"
9454900,9455500," successful"
9455500,9457260," did you"
9457260,9457680," implement"
9457680,9458200," attempt"
9458200,9458680," what is"
9458680,9459000," attempt"
9459000,9459220," I have"
9459220,9459480," no idea"
9459480,9459740," what the"
9459740,9459900," fuck"
9459900,9460020," is"
9460020,9460280," attempt"
9460280,9460500," I'm"
9460500,9460700," sorry"
9460700,9463320," so this"
9463320,9463600," is an"
9463600,9463860," error"
9463860,9464720," we can"
9464720,9465060," just"
9465060,9465400," ignore"
9465400,9465660," that"
9465660,9466000," error"
9466000,9467660," we can"
9467660,9467820," just"
9467820,9468040," ignore"
9468040,9468260," that"
9468260,9468540," error"
9468540,9469200," and we"
9469200,9469320," can"
9469320,9469660," return"
9469660,9470240," okay"
9470240,9471280," but we're"
9471280,9471440," gonna"
9471440,9472120," use"
9472120,9472340," the"
9472340,9472600," rest"
9472600,9472720," of"
9472720,9472820," the"
9472820,9473060," input"
9473060,9473300," as"
9473300,9473660," this"
9473660,9474420," and"
9474420,9475060," return"
9475060,9475340," just"
9475340,9475660," none"
9475660,9476240," okay"
9476240,9476520," so we"
9476520,9476760," have to"
9476760,9477080," actually"
9477080,9477480," be a"
9477480,9477580," little"
9477580,9477720," bit"
9477720,9478000," careful"
9478000,9478540," so this"
9478540,9478780," is the"
9478780,9478980," rest"
9478980,9479200," of the"
9479200,9479520," input"
9479520,9481760," so and"
9481760,9482240," this is"
9482240,9482560," the"
9482560,9483260," value"
9483260,9484040," so we'll"
9484040,9484320," have to"
9484320,9484620," wrap it"
9484620,9485560," like this"
9485560,9486760," some"
9486760,9487140," x"
9487140,9488620," so this"
9488620,9488900," has to"
9488900,9489120," be like"
9489120,9489480," this"
9489480,9493960," cool"
9493960,9494900," so this"
9494900,9495280," is an"
9495280,9495500," option"
9495500,9495860," one"
9495860,9504060," this"
9504060,9504460," is just"
9504460,9504480," just"

9504700,9505060," optional"
9505060,9505360," type"
9505360,9505520," so"
9505520,9505860," essentially"
9505860,9506180," if it"
9506180,9506520," fails"
9506520,9506740," it's"
9506740,9506880," not"
9506880,9507000," going"
9507000,9507100," to"
9507100,9507260," really"
9507260,9507600," fail"
9507600,9507760," the"
9507760,9507940," whole"
9507940,9508380," parsing"
9508380,9508660," it's"
9508660,9508800," going"
9508800,9508880," to"
9508880,9509100," just"

9511280,9512480," handle"
9512480,9512740," that"
9512740,9512960," if"
9512960,9513020," you"
9513020,9513180," want"

9515360,9515640," it's"
9515640,9515880," just"

9693600,9693800," right"
9693800,9694880," boys and girls"
9694880,9696020," let's make a small break"

9697200,9700640," oh"
9700640,9700980," shit"
9700980,9701440," yeah"
9701440,9703060," all right"
9703060,9703440," that's"
9703440,9703800," interesting"
9703800,9706420," okay"
9706420,9708000," have"
9708000,9708200," fun"

9730800,9760780," Thank you."
9760800,9790780," Thank you."
9790800,9820780," Thank you."
9820800,9824620," That was poggers. Hello. Welcome, everyone."
9824620,9829560," So, we need to implement menu."
9829560,9831320," We need to implement menu."
9831320,9834480," So, how can we implement that?"
9834480,9838500," Essentially, we need to apply this parser to the input as long as we can."
9838500,9840040," Right. As long as we can."
9840040,9841200," That's pretty simple."
9842960,9844520," So, here's the input."
9844520,9853740," And again, I'm probably going to use a very imperative code."
9860280,9862140," So, we want to have like..."
9862140,9862740," Oh, my God."
9862740,9865580," RT1337."
9865580,9872620," Thank you so much for eight months of Twitch Prime subscription."
9872620,9873120," Thank you."
9873120,9873400," Thank you."
9873400,9873740," Thank you."
9873740,9876040," And welcome back to our kick comrade club."
9876040,9876920," That's right."
9876920,9877860," Thank you."
9877860,9878100," Thank you."
9878100,9878280," Thank you."
9879140,9888180," So, we're going to accumulate the result of the parser application to our special cell."
9888180,9889840," And it's going to be a list."
9889840,9892720," We're going to just append those things to the list as we go."
9894420,9898560," And this one is interesting."
9898560,9902260," So, I don't know."
9902260,9909960," Maybe this one would be easier with tail recursion."
9909960,9913020," I think it would be a little bit easier with the tail recursion."
9913020,9915640," Because I can just do something like a rec loop."
9915640,9917680," And I'm going to accept the input here."
9917680,9921200," The complete concubines."
9921200,9921760," Cut tail."
9921760,9923960," All right."
9924420,9927860," So, wait a second."
9927860,9930540," Fail with to do."
9930540,9931600," All right."
9931600,9934560," So, and we're going to do loop on the input."
9934560,9935340," Cool."
9935340,9940980," So, what this thing can return is maybe the rest of the input."
9940980,9941980," That could be it."
9941980,9943360," All right."
9943360,9949020," And what we do here, we do p run on that input prime."
9949020,9952740," Let's actually not call it input prime because then we're going to get another input prime."
9953900,9954340," Right."
9954340,9959160," So, we're going to match it with tail recursion."
9959160,9959940," Yeah."
9959940,9963820," So, sometimes it's just a little bit more convenient to do things tail recursively."
9963820,9965740," Sometimes it's more convenient to do imperatively."
9965740,9967420," And you can just switch between the styles."
9967420,9970480," So, you can even use object-oriented style here."
9970480,9971400," But I never used it."
9971460,9973720," I don't think it's that great here."
9973720,9974800," But anyway."
9974800,9976060," So, we can have a keg."
9976060,9977560," Here's the input prime."
9977560,9979940," And we also get got a value."
9979940,9987760," So, what we have to, what we're going to do here is we're going to push that value into the result."
9987760,9988700," Right."
9989580,9991640," So, here's the very interesting syntax."
9991640,9993200," I'm going to explain it a little bit later."
9993200,9994080," But, yeah."
9995200,10000240," So, as I already mentioned, bang, dereferences the reference."
10000240,10007120," But if you want to replace a value inside of a reference, you have to use this kind of assignment operator."
10007120,10008180," Right."
10008360,10012860," So, basically, on the left side, this operator expects a reference."
10012860,10016800," And what it does, it replaces the value inside of a reference with this value."
10016800,10022060," So, this is how you can append a new value to a list, like an immutable variable."
10022060,10023100," All right."
10023100,10028720," In the case of an error, I suppose we have to ignore that error, which is not particularly great."
10028720,10029240," But anyway."
10029240,10033820," And we have to return the rest of the input like this."
10033820,10036060," And here we have to return the input."
10036060,10045780," So, loop itself, when it's done looping around, when it's done looping around, will return the rest of the input."
10045780,10047080," That's what it will do."
10047080,10049960," So, yep."
10049960,10051000," Right."
10051000,10053380," And the result is going to be contained somewhere here."
10053380,10063420," So, essentially, we'll have to return input prime and then result like this."
10063420,10064120," So, there we go."
10064120,10065880," We implemented many parts of combinator."
10066060,10071540," So, which basically applies the parser as long as it can until it encounters an error."
10071540,10073940," And then it returns the list of what it managed to parse."
10073940,10075020," Right."
10075020,10078560," So, let's try to test all of that."
10078560,10079460," Let's see if it compiles."
10079460,10081040," It, in fact, compiles."
10081040,10083620," And let's rerun all of this stuff."
10083620,10084680," And let's reload everything."
10086280,10089260," And also open this parkoon thingy."
10089260,10097720," So, what I'm thinking about, boys and girls, what I'm thinking about, let's create a parser combinator that parses a list of digits."
10097720,10098220," Right."
10099900,10101100," Do we have repeat operator?"
10101100,10102020," No."
10102020,10103140," I don't know how to implement it."
10103140,10103460," I'm sorry."
10103460,10106740," So, let's implement, like, digits."
10106740,10110960," And it's going to be basically parse while is digit."
10110960,10113000," And again, I don't have this digit, apparently."
10113000,10113480," Yeah, yeah."
10113480,10114740," So, I have to implement it yet again."
10114740,10117480," Is digit."
10119760,10120380," There we go."
10120380,10127700," So, luckily, you top, like, stores the previous history, which is quite convenient."
10127700,10130200," So, then I'm going to implement digits."
10130200,10131140," And there you go."
10131140,10132980," We have a parser combinator that parses digits."
10132980,10138140," So, essentially, if I do something like this, I can make an input out of it."
10138140,10143740," And then I can just do digits run."
10143740,10147820," And index out of bounds."
10149200,10150140," Oh, shit."
10150140,10153680," Index out of bounds."
10153680,10155440," I think I did a fucky-wacky."
10155440,10156340," Straight up."
10156340,10159740," Oh, I know what is going on."
10159740,10161320," I know what is going on."
10161320,10165780," So, it's not going to be a fucky-wacky if I have something here."
10165780,10166340," Yeah."
10166340,10170580," So, basically, it doesn't calculate this stuff correctly, unfortunately."
10170580,10173120," Nice."
10173120,10178600," So, this is a bug that we'll need to fix."
10178600,10180260," But, anyway, I can just do it like that."
10180260,10183180," No, we'll have to fix it, actually."
10183180,10185980," So, let's go and fix it."
10185980,10198280," So, the problem is that when you have an input that is fully consumed by parse while, it hits the end of the string and throws an exception."
10198280,10200360," Because it's not a valid, like, index or whatnot."
10200360,10202740," So, we need to do something about that."
10202740,10206220," So, let's go to parse while and try to fix that."
10206220,10206980," So, what's going on?"
10207660,10212640," So, essentially, in that case, i is going to be equal to n."
10212640,10213280," Right."
10213280,10215160," In that case, i is going to be equal to n."
10217360,10219020," And what we're doing..."
10219020,10223380," That one is very interesting."
10223740,10225660," So, if you have a string."
10225660,10227560," One, two, three, four, five."
10227560,10229660," And you string sub."
10232900,10234880," And it's going to be equal to five."
10234880,10235460," Right."
10235460,10237280," So, here, this is going to be equal to five."
10237280,10238200," And I'm going to do zero."
10238200,10241380," It produces a correct value."
10241380,10242140," So, wait a second."
10242140,10243620," It does produce a correct value."
10243620,10245360," Which is kind of interesting."
10245360,10246280," Can it do..."
10246280,10246540," Yeah."
10246540,10247900," It goes a little bit further."
10249900,10255960," So, why would it fail like that?"
10255960,10257440," Maybe it fails..."
10257440,10257700," Oh."
10257700,10260360," So, what if i swap them around?"
10260360,10262740," So, if this is going to be five..."
10262740,10263920," It still works."
10263920,10266600," So, if it consumes all of them, it shouldn't be a problem."
10266600,10268080," Wilkins."
10268080,10270480," Hello, comrades."
10270480,10271500," Thank you."
10271500,10275180," Thank you so much for nine months of a Twitch Prime subscription."
10275180,10276340," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
10276340,10279540," And welcome to our epic KComrade Club."
10279900,10282200," So, yeah."
10282200,10283480," Money rate."
10283480,10284000," Yes."
10284000,10288740," But it didn't work, except..."
10288740,10288960," Yeah."
10288960,10290300," I know that."
10290300,10292540," So, that's why I'm trying to find a problem here."
10292540,10302500," I know what's going on."
10302500,10306020," I think none of these things throw an error."
10306020,10308740," I think the error is thrown by this expression."
10308740,10309400," And you know why?"
10309900,10315500," This is why."
10315500,10321020," Got Scooter, by the way."
10321020,10325780," No, it's not Pepega or Camel."
10325780,10327960," It's a Pepega Sodin."
10327960,10328500," It's a Pepega or Camel."
10328500,10341240," So, let's give it a try."
10341240,10342240," Let's see if it's going to work now."
10342240,10345480," So, we're going to make an input and we're going to do parse."
10346120,10348040," Again, I need to do isDigits."
10348040,10349620," Yeah, there we go."
10349620,10355540," Parse while isDigit."
10355540,10358460," And I have to actually run it."
10358460,10359960," Okay."
10359960,10361340," It managed to parse the number."
10361340,10362300," Everything's okay."
10362900,10365780," So, but if I remove A, it still parses a number."
10365780,10366100," Okay."
10366100,10366980," That's perfect."
10366980,10368580," That is absolutely perfect."
10368580,10369820," Cool, cool, cool."
10369820,10371580," So, we can fix the bug."
10375540,10378820," Oh, I didn't even commit a parse while."
10378820,10384300," So, that means I can actually sneak my fix here."
10385560,10386180," Thank you."
10386180,10386640," Thank you."
10386640,10387840," Thank you for the points."
10387840,10388340," Thank you."
10388340,10392860," Oh, I'm Pepega with points."
10392860,10394180," God damn it."
10394180,10395140," I got GBTT again."
10395140,10396200," All right."
10396200,10399020," So, what do I want to do here?"
10399020,10400020," What the hell is going on?"
10400020,10401900," Ah."
10401900,10403460," So, implement."
10403460,10406540," I don't need to append a null character."
10406540,10406960," Yes."
10406960,10414240," Implement parse while combinator."
10415040,10417140," I'm going to push that right into the repo."
10417140,10419560," Okay."
10419560,10423200," So, then we need to test."
10423200,10423560," Yeah."
10423560,10426620," So, let's actually come up with a very interesting parse accumulator."
10426620,10427700," So, we're going to have digits."
10427700,10431180," Digits."
10431180,10436960," Digits."
10436960,10439020," Where is the definition?"
10439020,10439640," Yeah, there we go."
10439640,10440780," Here's the definition of digits."
10440780,10442940," It's basically parse while is digit."
10442940,10443640," Makes sense."
10444300,10449200," So, now let's implement something like numbers."
10449200,10450920," And what is it going to be?"
10450920,10451800," What is it going to be?"
10451800,10454380," So, first, we have digits."
10454380,10455360," Right."
10455360,10464820," Then, we combine sequentially with many spaces."
10467460,10468200," digits."
10468200,10469680," There we go."
10469680,10471280," Here's a very interesting thing."
10471280,10476460," So, first, we have some sort of a number."
10476460,10480720," And then, many other digits separated by the space."
10480720,10484720," And that should return us the list of numbers."
10485200,10488940," So, furthermore, this entire thing may..."
10488940,10491820," It returns, actually, a pair."
10491820,10494960," I can't even show you what exactly it returns."
10495780,10500520," So, it has a type of a pair string and string list."
10500520,10503000," So, it returns a head and a tail."
10503000,10509520," So, what you'll have to do here is probably connect them together somehow."
10509520,10512900," So, you can have something like X and X's."
10512900,10516020," And essentially, you can just do like this."
10516840,10520700," And then, you just have like a list of these strings."
10520700,10527100," And furthermore, you can do something cool and map all of that."
10527100,10534060," So, we can take all of these values and map them, list map, to int of a string."
10534060,10535020," Like this."
10535020,10538760," And you will get like a parser that like returns you numbers."
10539400,10542340," So, essentially, if you have something like one, two, three."
10542340,10543900," One, two, three."
10543900,10546880," And you pipe it into like make input."
10546880,10548880," Oh, wait a second."
10548880,10550340," Yeah, okay."
10550340,10551440," So, it's not going to work properly."
10551440,10557220," But if you pipe it into numbers run, you get a list of numbers."
10557220,10559400," But they are reversed order because I'm Bebeko."
10559400,10561040," But it tried."
10561040,10563460," It actually tried to do that."
10563460,10567120," So, the thing we need to do when we parse the menu."
10567560,10569780," We have to actually reverse the result."
10569780,10571860," So, the result has to be reversed."
10571860,10574080," So, let's actually try that one more time."
10574080,10576000," Yeah."
10576000,10581200," So, it's going to be load open is digits."
10581200,10589820," Can I do something like let is digits?"
10589820,10590520," There we go."
10590520,10592820," Then, we define let digits."
10592820,10593960," There we go."
10593960,10596260," Then, I define numbers."
10597560,10598420," Let numbers."
10598420,10600120," Here they are."
10600120,10603560," And now, I can try to do something like this."
10603560,10604140," Yeah, there we go."
10604140,10606300," So, this should work now properly."
10606300,10607200," There we go."
10607200,10609760," So, we had a string one, two, three, four, five."
10609760,10613420," And we turned it into an actual string from one, two, three, four, five."
10613420,10619700," And we did that with this combination of parsers."
10620120,10620380," Right."
10620380,10622180," We did that with this combination of parsers."
10622180,10626260," And that's exactly what we were trying to achieve."
10626260,10627300," Right."
10627300,10629340," So, first, you have digits."
10629340,10635280," Then, you have many of these sequences."
10635280,10636980," Basically, space and other digits."
10636980,10638720," And then, we transform all of them."
10638720,10639780," We just combine everything."
10639780,10641300," And we turn everything into integers."
10641500,10651420," So, this is already actually a functioning, a functioning parser community library that you can probably use in production to parse things."
10651420,10660080," So, let's see what we can do about it."
10660080,10662720," Functional library."
10662720,10664600," Very funny."
10664600,10666560," So, let's do different committees."
10669560,10670900," So, here's the first thing."
10670900,10676900," Implement optional parser combinator."
10676900,10680220," What if more than was space between that?"
10680220,10681020," That means it will fail."
10681020,10687580," Implement menu parser combinator."
10687580,10692100," Let's push that right into the repo."
10692100,10694520," Okay."
10694520,10696580," So, yeah."
10696580,10698580," The library is pretty much production ready."
10698580,10699280," Believe it or not."
10699360,10702240," Like, it took 137 lines of code."
10702240,10705720," And this is an actually useful parser combinator library."
10705720,10706280," Like, seriously."
10706280,10707320," Like, it has everything."
10707320,10708560," You don't really need that much."
10708560,10712500," We don't really need that much."
10712500,10713620," It's a super simple one."
10713620,10718280," And now, let's try to implement, like, a new parser using this library."
10718280,10720120," This is exactly what we started with."
10720120,10722660," How can we implement a new parser?"
10724260,10725460," To, to, to, to, to, to, to, to."
10725460,10725460," To, to, to."
10725460,10728860," Any parser."
10728860,10734640," All right."
10734640,10741880," Any parser is supposed to return a list of sections."
10741880,10743600," A list of sections."
10746100,10747920," And it only took two hours."
10747920,10748220," Yeah."
10748220,10751920," So, I think people overcomplicate parser community libraries."
10751920,10753980," You don't really need much."
10753980,10756520," You just need, you know, recursive descent functions."
10756520,10758840," And you just need a way to glue them together."
10758840,10759580," And that's it."
10760460,10761540," So, yeah."
10761540,10766120," So, I think we're going to start with..."
10766120,10767700," Oh."
10767700,10771360," Yeah."
10771360,10772800," This stuff is complicated."
10772800,10782780," Looks good parser community is impressed."
10782780,10785000," I don't know."
10785000,10787360," Maybe your parser community is more flexible."
10788280,10792100," Are you going to implement subby like the one from the JSON video?"
10792100,10793580," We can try to do that."
10793580,10794960," Sure."
10794960,10796800," I don't remember exactly what it does."
10796800,10802620," So, it accepts a separator and the parsers and just..."
10802620,10802760," Yeah."
10802760,10804500," We can try to do something like that."
10804500,10808240," But I'm not sure if it's going to be particularly useful for our case."
10808240,10812260," Sure, it's going to be particularly useful for our case."
10812260,10815260," Any..."
10815260,10819380," Is a knee that useful to parse?"
10819380,10831480," So, what's funny..."
10831480,10835680," A knee is kind of like a line-based."
10836100,10841580," So, I'm not sure if parsing something like that in the knee is easy."
10841580,10845300," Well, we can try."
10845300,10847680," So, we can try to implement like a very..."
10847680,10848980," Like very simple things."
10848980,10854980," I'm going to do it like this."
10855220,10856760," So, we have sections and whatnot."
10856760,10860080," I'm going to keep it..."
10860080,10860760," Read the whole file."
10860760,10862500," I'm going to temporarily remove this thing."
10862500,10864780," We'll see how it goes."
10867520,10868740," So, section..."
10868740,10871320," Section name."
10871320,10871920," Right."
10871920,10872740," A section name..."
10872740,10879740," Is expected to be..."
10879740,10885560," It's a parser that returns a string."
10885560,10887740," Parcum parser."
10888900,10890780," So, how can we implement such parsers?"
10890780,10892280," So, essentially..."
10892280,10895740," I'm going to do let open parcum..."
10895740,10897760," Parcum in."
10897760,10902520," So, basically, it imports everything from that module into the scope of this function."
10902520,10907020," But not to the scope of outside function."
10907020,10915960," So, we expect a prefix of this thing."
10915960,10919800," And then, we don't want this prefix at all."
10919800,10921840," This prefix is not part of the name."
10921840,10923740," So, that means we're going to ignore it."
10923740,10927520," And then, we do parse while..."
10927520,10931400," This thing is not equal to this thing."
10931800,10934600," And then, prefix this thing."
10934600,10935760," So, there we go."
10935760,10938400," We have a parser community that parses..."
10938400,10943920," That parses this particular title."
10943920,10945840," So, we can try to build it."
10945840,10948200," And see how it works."
10948200,10950740," Any parcumers in the chat?"
10950740,10951640," Yeah, it's me."
10951640,10952600," I'm a parcumer."
10952600,10955340," Okay."
10955340,10955920," Utop."
10955920,10957840," And also, we need to include examples."
10957840,10959700," So, we're going to include everything."
10959700,10961080," And I'm going to load..."
10961080,10963340," Not on the parcum."
10963340,10965040," I want to load recursively."
10965040,10967680," Any..."
10967680,10969080," Yeah, any CMO."
10969080,10971740," And everything seems to be loaded correctly."
10971740,10973340," And in any..."
10973340,10974420," What we have..."
10974420,10975920," We have section name."
10975920,10976680," Right."
10976680,10978200," So, we have a section name."
10978200,10979760," And if we take a look at it..."
10979760,10981520," It's a parser that returns a string."
10981520,10983100," So, what do we have here?"
10983100,10984060," We can have hello."
10984060,10985780," We're going to have hello."
10988300,10992420," And I also want to open parcum."
10992420,10994740," We're going to have hello."
10994740,10996180," We're going to turn it into an input."
10996180,10999560," And then it's going to be any..."
10999560,11000560," Section..."
11000560,11003480," Section name."
11003480,11005060," So, here's the section name."
11005060,11005920," We run this thing."
11005920,11007140," And..."
11007140,11007780," Yeah."
11007780,11008780," It managed to parse it."
11008840,11010200," So, the input was that."
11010200,11011720," And it turned it into hello."
11011720,11013060," Everything looks okay."
11013060,11015100," So, if I add some..."
11015100,11015620," Like, world."
11015620,11017420," It still works."
11017420,11020060," So, it actually extracts this thing out of this..."
11020060,11020680," You know..."
11020680,11021500," Out of this brackets."
11021740,11024080," So we have a section name."
11024080,11029080," Now, we probably want to have something like payer."
11029080,11032620," We already have a payer, what's called payer parser."
11032620,11036220," So a payer parser will return you literally a payer."
11036220,11046460," All right, so how is gonna be?"
11046460,11051320," So essentially, we're gonna make an assumption that,"
11051740,11058580," the keys, the keys are alphanumeric, right?"
11058580,11059900," They're gonna be alphanumeric."
11059900,11067060," So, and also they can start with white spaces, right?"
11067060,11071120," So we probably wanna implement something like white spaces,"
11071120,11072400," right?"
11072400,11075320," Or white spaces, something like this."
11075320,11080080," So it's a parser that removes all of the white spaces."
11081300,11082760," So how does it do it?"
11082760,11088520," Well, it just parses while it is a white space, right?"
11088520,11091460," Parse while is space."
11091460,11094660," And I'm not even sure if we have something like that."
11094660,11096540," Space, no."
11096540,11097940," Nah, we don't have anything like that."
11097940,11103260," We can do something like fun x equal to space."
11103260,11105760," So this entire thing will parse while white spaces."
11105760,11106720," So, okay."
11106720,11108900," The payer can start with this."
11108900,11110480," We wanna ignore it."
11110480,11115100," And of course, we're gonna do it like that."
11115100,11119880," So, then we're gonna have like a payer name, I suppose."
11119880,11127680," Maybe key parser."
11127680,11130260," We wanna preserve it though."
11130260,11131720," We do wanna preserve it."
11131720,11136620," But then you can have white spaces here, right?"
11136660,11154880," You can have white spaces here, then you may have a prefix equal, you may have prefix equal, then you may have white spaces,"
11154940,11164500," And then you may have like a value parser, but I'm not sure how to come by this."
11164500,11166580," So, it's probably gonna be something like this."
11166580,11180940," Okay, I have an idea."
11180940,11183140," So, I will probably have to do it like this."
11183140,11186620," Right, so, it's gonna be like that."
11186620,11190740," Right, so, this is the first part."
11190740,11193620," And then we'll have to combine it like this."
11193620,11195140," And this is gonna be the second part."
11195140,11196820," Yeah, there we go."
11196820,11203380," So, we have white spaces, key, then more white spaces, then prefix."
11203380,11205860," And as you can see, they all point towards the key parser."
11205860,11208260," So, that means any of these values are gonna be thrown away."
11208260,11212900," Then we sequentially combine it with this, where any spaces are gonna be thrown away."
11212900,11216180," And with the value power, we might as well, actually,"
11216180,11221300," maybe put white spaces here to get rid of them from here."
11221300,11222340," Right."
11222740,11224820," Chat, why are you dead?"
11224820,11227380," Why did you become dead all of a sudden?"
11227380,11228180," Is everything okay?"
11228180,11232740," We're just trying to make a simple parser."
11232740,11237780," We're a noter."
11237780,11244020," And I wonder how well that will work."
11244020,11249380," So, let's have a key parser."
11249380,11253620," And let's say that it's anything that is not a space."
11254420,11254820," Right."
11254820,11254820," Right."
11254820,11256580," So, let's say that it's a parse while"
11256580,11261380," x, not a space."
11261380,11265860," And not an equals."
11265860,11269860," Then we can have value parser."
11273940,11274980," The same one, actually."
11274980,11280740," We might as well have something like name then."
11280740,11282100," And this is gonna be this."
11282100,11285460," Name."
11287620,11288580," This is another name."
11288580,11292340," And that will result in just two pairs."
11292340,11295380," It will just result in two pairs."
11303220,11304100," How I'm programmed."
11304100,11304500," What?"
11304500,11305220," I don't understand."
11305220,11306100," Is it a question to me?"
11306100,11306740," I don't understand."
11306740,11307060," I'm sorry."
11307060,11308740," Pair is just that."
11308740,11308980," Okay."
11308980,11309780," So, that should work."
11316900,11319300," Did you bypass check by using /me?"
11319300,11320180," Apparently."
11320180,11321060," Apparently it works."
11321060,11324100," Interesting."
11324100,11334500," Hacked."
11334500,11335540," Actual hacker."
11335540,11336260," Would you look at that?"
11336260,11342580," So, this is gonna be the pair parser."
11342580,11343940," This is gonna be the pair parser."
11343940,11346500," So, maybe I wanna make a cup of tea."
11347700,11348900," Before we check all of that."
11348900,11350740," Let me make a cup of tea."
11350740,11355940," Maybe I'm gonna test it first."
11355940,11360020," If it's a no prepense zero."
11360020,11363620," Will you fix it?"
11363620,11363940," Maybe."
11363940,11367860," I mean, at any point I can just ban people who abuse that."
11367860,11374020," Okay."
11376900,11378980," I'm gonna sneeze."
11378980,11389380," Load."
11389380,11392020," Recarcer with this thing."
11392020,11393620," And then we're gonna open parkum."
11393620,11395380," Any."
11395380,11397460," What I'm looking for?"
11397460,11399220," I'm looking for a pair parser."
11399220,11404180," And what we're gonna have here is hello equal world."
11404180,11408500," And we can also put like arbitrary amount of spaces here."
11409540,11411380," We can turn that into an input."
11411380,11412740," Make input."
11412740,11415780," We can turn that into an input."
11415780,11420500," And we're gonna run the pair parser on it."
11420500,11422260," And we got a pair hello world."
11422260,11424100," So, this was the input."
11424100,11426660," It's going to review."
11426660,11429140," If you never use them."
11430020,11430980," I do actually."
11430980,11431620," I do read them."
11431620,11432980," I just have so many of them."
11432980,11435700," That I cannot respond to all of them."
11435700,11436180," But yeah."
11436180,11438020," I managed to parse the pair."
11438020,11441220," And I can try to remove something."
11441220,11442740," Introduce like syntactical error."
11442740,11443460," And it will say."
11443460,11446420," Expected equals at position 10."
11446420,11448260," Like seriously."
11448260,11449060," That of the cells."
11449060,11450180," If you remove equals."
11450180,11452500," Expected this at position 10."
11452980,11454420," And yeah."
11454420,11455780," Then it works."
11455780,11459860," So, yeah."
11459860,11461860," Now we are capable of parsing pairs."
11461860,11462660," And shit like that."
11462660,11465620," Which is pretty cool."
11465620,11472100," So, we'll see how it goes."
11472100,11473300," We'll see how it goes."
11473300,11477940," The problem is that we also have."
11477940,11480020," Can have like empty lines."
11480020,11482260," And it's not particularly great."
11482980,11486260," So, I don't know how."
11486260,11487860," We can handle empty lines here."
11487860,11491060," This parser is expecting too much."
11491060,11491460," No."
11491460,11493300," It expects like actually."
11493300,11495140," Exactly enough."
11495140,11502740," So, we can try to do the one."
11502740,11503860," Without new lines."
11503860,11505220," This one is not particularly easy."
11505220,11506580," To parse with parser commuters."
11506580,11507300," But we can try."
11513860,11514420," All right."
11514420,11517380," So, maybe we can try to do a section parser."
11517380,11519620," A section parser."
11519620,11521140," And it will return a section."
11521140,11526420," It will return a section."
11529220,11530980," Oh, this one is going to be actually very interesting."
11530980,11531940," So, I think we can."
11531940,11533860," We can do something about that."
11533860,11535300," Part from parser."
11535300,11538420," Essentially."
11538420,11539220," A section."
11539220,11541460," Is a section name."
11541460,11543380," Section name."
11543380,11545540," And many."
11545540,11547300," Pairs."
11548500,11549380," That's what they are."
11549380,11550420," It's just a section."
11550420,11550900," Name."
11550900,11551460," And many."
11551460,11552260," Pairs."
11552260,11553540," How about that?"
11553540,11554740," That's pretty straightforward."
11554740,11557860," And after that."
11557860,11558420," What we can do."
11558420,11559860," We can just map all of that."
11559860,11561860," So, it's a parser comm."
11561860,11564420," We can actually do some open parser comm in."
11564420,11566900," Just map."
11566900,11568020," And here we're going to have."
11568020,11570260," Name."
11570260,11572180," And pairs."
11574340,11576660," And I can just turn it into the section."
11576660,11578580," Because section is a special time."
11578580,11579540," The type."
11579540,11580740," So, it's going to be a name."
11580740,11582500," And then."
11582500,11583300," List of pairs."
11583300,11591300," Cool."
11591300,11592500," And that's it actually."
11592500,11595060," So, now we know how to parse a single section."
11595060,11598420," And we can say that the .ini file."
11598420,11599300," Let .ini."
11599300,11600340," Okay, I already removed it."
11600340,11603060," So, .ini parser."
11603060,11603860," .ini parser."
11604340,11607140," section list."
11607140,11609140," Parcum parser."
11609140,11612340," Is essentially just many sections."
11612340,11615700," Just many sections."
11615700,11617860," All right."
11617860,11619460," So, there we go."
11619460,11621780," So, this is how we just combine all of them together."
11621780,11624260," Making more and more powerful parsers."
11624260,11626820," And, yep."
11626820,11629540," And that didn't work for some reason."
11629540,11632180," Unbound name constructor."
11632180,11633460," Let's code S then."
11633460,11635300," S."
11635300,11637860," And this one is going to be PS."
11637860,11640180," This one is going to be PS."
11640180,11640740," Oh, yeah."
11640740,11641300," I'm sorry."
11641300,11642260," It has to be equal."
11642260,11643620," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
11643620,11644500," It has to be equal."
11646180,11647780," Why .ini and not Toml?"
11647780,11648980," I don't know."
11648980,11652820," So, somebody suggested at the beginning of the stream to use .ini."
11652820,11654340," And now we're sticking with .ini."
11654340,11656020," So, sorry."
11656020,11659860," If somebody suggested .ini at the beginning of the stream, we could parse ."
11659860,11661300," But this is just an example."
11661860,11666260," Just to see how we can apply this, you know, library."
11666260,11668580," Yeah."
11668580,11671780," By the way, I want to do a following thing."
11671780,11673940," I think we don't need show."
11673940,11676180," Because we're going to do that in Ripple anyway."
11676180,11677060," Right?"
11677700,11681220," So, and I want to replace some of this thing with like underscore T."
11681220,11684260," Underscore T."
11684260,11685380," Underscore Payer."
11685380,11686100," This is a section."
11686100,11689540," And the reason why I want to have like underscore T there is because I want to"
11690260,11693300," have like a proper names for these things."
11693300,11699380," Like section name, white space, Payer, section, .ini."
11699380,11700900," You see?"
11700900,11704980," So, now it looks like a grammar of some sort here."
11704980,11708580," And we do use open Parcum like everywhere."
11708580,11712340," Maybe it makes sense to just open Parcum like at the top."
11712340,11713620," So, we don't waste much time."
11713620,11715940," And yeah."
11715940,11719940," So, just remove all of that here."
11721220,11721540," Yeah."
11721540,11723780," So, yeah."
11723780,11724420," Looks cool."
11724420,11724820," Looks cool."
11724820,11726580," So, is it going to compile?"
11726580,11727460," Yeah."
11727460,11729380," It has to be underscore T underscore value."
11729380,11734260," So, Payer underscore T."
11734260,11734500," Sure."
11734500,11736340," Underscore T."
11736340,11741940," Notice how it fails at the first error."
11741940,11745700," It doesn't try to continue like compiling if it encountered an error."
11745700,11748820," It just shows you the first relevant error, which is so beautiful."
11749380,11752740," Like I think all compilers should do that."
11752740,11756260," Right, section."
11756260,11757620," There we go."
11757620,11760660," So, any is just many section."
11760660,11764340," Section is a section name and many pairs."
11764340,11772740," Payer is just a name and a name separated by equals with white spaces between them."
11773300,11778020," And name is just something that is not space or equals."
11778020,11780740," And white spaces is just something that is white space."
11780740,11782020," And section name is that."
11782020,11782580," And yeah."
11782580,11783940," This is the whole grammar pretty much."
11784580,11787460," So, let's actually test how all of that works."
11787460,11790180," So, I have a test file somewhere there."
11792260,11794500," So, we don't handle like empty lines and whatnot."
11794500,11795220," Right."
11795220,11796340," We don't handle empty lines."
11796340,11801140," So, let's reopen this thing."
11801140,11803780," And I'm going to load this stuff like this."
11803780,11804580," And then open."
11804580,11806820," Actually, I need to."
11806820,11807860," Do I need to open Park Room?"
11807860,11808020," Yeah."
11808020,11809060," I need to open Park Room."
11809060,11810260," Any."
11811220,11812260," So, we're going to have here."
11812260,11814580," We'll need to read a whole file."
11814580,11816100," We're going to read examples."
11816100,11820980," Examples."
11820980,11822100," Test."
11822100,11823300," Any."
11823300,11826100," And we're going to try to read the whole file."
11826100,11826260," Okay."
11826260,11827620," We managed to read the whole file."
11827620,11829220," Then we're going to turn it into the input."
11829220,11831140," Making this an input."
11831140,11831380," Okay."
11831380,11832900," This is the whole input."
11832900,11834580," And I'm going to do any."
11834580,11835940," Any run."
11835940,11837700," And I managed to parse the any file."
11837700,11839380," Wait."
11841220,11842820," That is very Pepega, by the way."
11842820,11844180," But yeah."
11844180,11848900," So, I guess white spaces should also include new lines."
11848900,11856100," Okay."
11856100,11857140," That's not that big of a deal."
11857140,11864180," Equal or x equal new."
11864180,11865140," All right."
11865140,11869620," So, let's just try to reload that."
11870820,11871860," Then open."
11871860,11872820," Yeah."
11872820,11874340," So."
11874340,11875940," And let's go back in the history."
11875940,11876260," And."
11876260,11880340," Still didn't work for some reason."
11880340,11882340," Anki Doodle."
11882340,11884180," Is gifting one to a sub to Tony Community."
11884180,11886100," Thank you so much for supporting the channel."
11886100,11888260," And VRax."
11888260,11889460," Welcome."
11889460,11890100," To our epic."
11890100,11892100," What are we?"
11892100,11893300," What are we today?"
11893300,11894340," Parsley Community Club."
11894340,11894740," That's right."
11895780,11897220," So, this one is interesting."
11897220,11898820," So, maybe."
11898820,11901620," We should do that slightly differently."
11901620,11920020," So, it would be a little bit easier if we could split that by lines."
11920020,11922420," And actually use parser communities for lines."
11922420,11925940," But I don't think we can do it right now."
11925940,11934580," So, I think we could expand our parser community library to have customizable inputs."
11934580,11937220," Or inputs could be not necessarily strings."
11937220,11940740," But sequences of any things."
11940740,11941220," Right."
11941220,11941460," So."
11941460,11948260," I think you need a double assess at the end of the value."
11948260,11948740," Probably."
11949780,11950980," Let's do that."
11950980,11954580," WSS at the end of the value."
11954580,11957460," All right."
11957460,11959940," So, that sounds like a good idea."
11959940,11962180," So, that should actually work."
11962180,11965460," Load."
11965460,11966500," Open."
11966500,11968660," And let's go back."
11968660,11971060," And it didn't work."
11971060,11971620," What the fuck?"
11971620,11975220," Hmm."
11975220,11977220," Ah."
11978260,11978820," All right."
11978820,11979860," So, you know what we can do?"
11979860,11982740," We can introduce is space."
11982740,11985060," So, this is going to be just that."
11985060,11990980," And then we're going to put this thing here."
11990980,11992260," So, this is is space."
11992260,11994020," And WSS is that."
11994020,11996260," Is space."
11996260,11997700," The next time."
12003140,12004740," Is space not."
12004740,12004740," Is space not."
12004740,12006660," Like this."
12006660,12011060," Uh huh."
12011060,12012980," Oh."
12012980,12015540," I think because this is used as dereferencing."
12015540,12016740," You have to use not here."
12016740,12016900," Yeah."
12016900,12017620," I remember that."
12017620,12018900," Uh."
12018900,12019140," Yeah."
12019140,12019380," Yeah."
12019380,12019460," Yeah."
12019460,12020580," So, that should work now."
12020580,12021060," Hopefully."
12021060,12021460," I don't know."
12021460,12021780," We'll see."
12021780,12023940," So, uh."
12023940,12024180," Yep."
12025220,12026100," And would you look at that."
12026100,12028500," Isn't that epic?"
12028500,12029220," Isn't that epic?"
12029220,12030180," I think it's pretty epic."
12030180,12033940," I think it's pretty goddamn epic."
12036580,12038340," So, and uh."
12038340,12039620," We parsed."
12039620,12040100," This thing."
12040100,12043700," I think it will also support empty lines."
12043700,12044580," If you think about."
12044580,12044900," Yeah."
12044900,12045620," It will."
12045620,12046100," If you."
12046100,12047060," If you think about that."
12047060,12047860," It will support."
12047860,12048020," Yeah."
12048020,12049300," It also support empty lines."
12049300,12051140," So, that's super cool."
12051140,12052500," Huh."
12052500,12055300," Yep."
12055300,12059860," But this is not the best way of parsing these kind of things."
12059860,12060340," I would say."
12060340,12061380," But."
12061380,12064020," Sort of an okay-ish way of doing that."
12065940,12066900," Accidental feature."
12066900,12067140," Yeah."
12067140,12069620," So, a better way of parsing that."
12069620,12071540," Would be first splitting that into."
12071540,12073140," Lines."
12073140,12074660," And parsing them line by lines."
12074660,12078980," Parsing them line by lines."
12078980,12086740," And tokens."
12086740,12087060," Ah."
12087060,12087780," Maybe tokens."
12087780,12090100," I think tokens would be overkill for this situation."
12090100,12091380," I think lines would be okay."
12091380,12092900," But."
12092900,12095780," That will require a customizable input."
12095940,12100100," That will require a customizable input."
12100100,12107940," All right."
12107940,12110580," So, let's do a committee committee for what we already have here."
12110580,12116260," All right."
12117540,12119780," I'm not really sure if I want to go into the comments."
12119780,12122340," Right now at least."
12122340,12127620," Implement a simple any parser using the library."
12127620,12128980," All right."
12128980,12130420," Let's push that right into the repo."
12134020,12134820," So, yeah."
12134820,12134820," So, yeah."
12134820,12135860," That's actually pretty cool."
12135860,12158100," So, how a comment would look like."
12158820,12159380," By the way."
12159380,12159380," By the way."
12159380,12162020," How a comment would look like."
12162020,12163620," Let's actually think about it."
12163620,12164980," Maybe we can introduce comments."
12164980,12166260," Comment."
12166260,12168740," It's actually very interesting."
12168740,12170260," So, string."
12170260,12171620," Parcum."
12171620,12173140," Parcum."
12173140,12174260," Passa."
12174260,12175780," And."
12175780,12177620," So, what's that?"
12177620,12179300," So, the first thing."
12179300,12182100," It starts with the prefix dot."
12182100,12185140," And we want to ignore it."
12185140,12186820," So, that's why we're combining it like that."
12186820,12190260," So, then we parse while."
12190260,12191860," Parse while."
12191860,12198100," The x is not end of the file."
12198100,12201300," So, that's the comments."
12201300,12205940," Did I do void?"
12205940,12206900," God damn it."
12208020,12208500," Um."
12208500,12212580," And where can we put the comments?"
12212580,12214260," That's a very interesting question."
12214260,12221540," Because we first start with the section."
12221540,12224660," Section may start with a comment."
12224660,12233620," Yeah."
12237620,12239540," You start parsing section."
12239540,12241540," And it just doesn't work."
12241540,12246900," If you wrap a comment in optional."
12246900,12248420," Oh yeah."
12248420,12249860," You also have to wrap it in optional."
12249860,12250340," Of course."
12263460,12264740," If you wrap comment is optional."
12264740,12265780," You can put it as."
12265780,12267060," Or."
12267060,12267540," Payer."
12267540,12270260," And at the end of the pair as well."
12270260,12274820," All right."
12274820,12277380," But the problem is that."
12277380,12279220," Comment will return a string."
12279220,12280340," They have different types."
12280340,12282340," They have to have the same types."
12282340,12283460," For it to be like that."
12283460,12285780," Maybe."
12288740,12289860," I don't want to go with that."
12289860,12291300," It's actually kind of complicated."
12291300,12293380," My brain doesn't work anymore."
12293380,12294340," So."
12294340,12298020," I think parsing committers are just not the right way of parsing this kind of thing."
12298020,12301220," But I just used like ""ini"" as an example anyway."
12302100,12302340," So."
12302340,12307060," Maybe I want to also provide some examples to test this kind of stuff."
12307060,12309140," Yeah."
12309140,12310580," We already have this input."
12313780,12315700," Hello Father Staffel."
12315700,12316500," Welcome to the stream."
12316500,12318420," All right."
12318420,12318900," So."
12318900,12320020," We need to have like."
12320020,12320980," Input."
12320980,12324900," So."
12324900,12326100," The input is going to be."
12326100,12328660," How do you access command line arguments in."
12328660,12329300," In the camel."
12329300,12332580," Command line arguments."
12332580,12333220," Let's find out."
12333220,12335540," Jason has no comments."
12335540,12335860," Yeah."
12339540,12340340," RGV."
12340340,12340580," Okay."
12340580,12342340," So it's SysRGV."
12342340,12342820," All right."
12342820,12343940," SysRGV."
12343940,12345860," There we go."
12345860,12346340," Looks good."
12346340,12348820," So what we'll have to do."
12348820,12349620," We'll have to match."
12349620,12354420," SysRGV with."
12354420,12356500," And."
12356500,12358500," Then we're going to have a program."
12358500,12359620," Name."
12359620,12360500," That we're going to ignore."
12360500,12361540," And."
12361540,12364180," File name."
12364180,12364420," Right."
12364420,12366820," File with."
12366820,12368340," To do."
12370500,12371060," All right."
12371060,12371460," And."
12371460,12372500," If it's something else."
12372500,12373940," We have to actually fail."
12373940,12375220," Saying that."
12375220,12376580," Expected."
12376580,12378500," File path."
12378500,12379220," To an."
12379220,12381220," Expected path."
12381220,12382500," To an."
12382500,12383460," Any file."
12383460,12384500," That's what we expect here."
12384500,12386740," So now."
12386740,12388100," I'm going to take a file name."
12388100,12390660," I called it file path though."
12390660,12390900," So."
12390900,12392500," Let's call it like that."
12392500,12395060," Read."
12395060,12395780," Whole file."
12395780,12397780," Make an input out of it."
12397780,12399380," Make an input out of it."
12400500,12401460," And then."
12401460,12405540," Any run."
12405540,12406660," Right."
12406660,12407780," We do a new run."
12407780,12409140," And."
12409140,12411220," This thing returns the result."
12411220,12411540," Right."
12411540,12412500," You get the results."
12412500,12412900," And."
12412900,12414660," We'll have to parse it appropriately."
12414660,12416180," Because it could be a failure."
12416180,12418100," So."
12418100,12419540," If it's an okay."
12419540,12422260," Here is."
12422260,12424660," Sections."
12424660,12425700," So we got sections."
12428900,12429940," And in case of an error."
12429940,12431940," We have to print."
12431940,12432980," An appropriate error."
12432980,12436500," So let's print something like this."
12436500,12437300," Printf."
12437300,12438740," Error."
12438740,12440340," During."
12440340,12441140," Parsing."
12441140,12441540," At."
12441540,12442420," Position."
12442420,12442660," D."
12442660,12443940," S."
12443940,12444260," S."
12444260,12447540," God damn it."
12447540,12450740," So."
12450740,12451300," Error."
12451300,12452660," Description."
12452660,12453940," There we go."
12453940,12455540," Okay."
12455540,12455780," So."
12455780,12456660," And we need to print."
12456660,12457300," The sections."
12457300,12457780," Yet again."
12457780,12458260," So I'm."
12458260,12459220," Getting back to."
12459220,12460100," What I had before."
12460100,12464020," So."
12464020,12467060," There's no way."
12467060,12467860," To just print."
12467860,12468580," That thing."
12468580,12469540," In a camel."
12469540,12470500," There's no way."
12470500,12471540," To just print a type."
12471540,12472660," Or make the type."
12472660,12473140," Showable."
12473140,12473460," So."
12473460,12473740," Which."
12473740,12474940," Which makes it kind of sad."
12474940,12475220," But."
12475220,12477080," It is what it is."
12477080,12478280," Error."
12478280,12478460," By the way."
12478460,12478680," Siding."
12478680,12479100," I know."
12479100,12479920," It's a bit of topic."
12479920,12480540," But I think."
12480540,12481400," You could optimize."
12481400,12481960," The parser."
12481960,12482520," By removing."
12482520,12483180," Prefix."
12483180,12484140," From the section."
12484140,12484780," And replace it."
12484780,12485640," With something like."
12485640,12488180," Maybe."
12488180,12489820," Error."
12489820,12491740," Like."
12491740,12493020," Any single character."
12493020,12493840," Is that what you mean?"
12493840,12495260," Any single character."
12495260,12497220," Or."
12497220,12498020," I."
12498020,12499100," Not really sure."
12499100,12499840," How it's."
12499840,12500260," Okay."
12501540,12502860," Any single character."
12502860,12507340," Ah."
12507340,12508080," I see what you mean."
12508080,12511260," Ah."
12511260,12512680," Because."
12512680,12513260," Yeah."
12513260,12513780," Because I."
12513780,12514360," Compare."
12514360,12515160," With a single."
12515160,12516080," Thing here."
12516080,12516760," Like twice."
12516760,12518720," Error."
12518720,12519100," Maybe."
12519100,12520320," It's an interesting idea."
12520320,12522460," Error."
12522460,12524140," Yeah."
12524140,12524840," I see what you mean."
12524840,12525640," It's kind of fun."
12525640,12527820," Error."
12527820,12529980," And how would you."
12529980,12530580," Implement like."
12530680,12531980," Any single character."
12531980,12533120," Let's actually think about it."
12533120,12533420," Any."
12533420,12543040," SRC."
12543040,12544180," Parcum."
12544180,12545500," Any."
12545500,12547660," Any char."
12547660,12548900," Let's actually call it like that."
12548900,12550480," And it's a parser."
12550480,12551540," That returns you."
12551540,12552560," A single character."
12552560,12553140," That's."
12553140,12554140," That's literally what it does."
12556140,12556640," So."
12556640,12556640," So."
12556640,12557640," And."
12557640,12560980," Here's the sink."
12560980,12562580," It's an interesting thing."
12562580,12564260," If."
12564260,12566020," The length."
12566020,12567480," Of the input."
12567480,12571520," Is equal to zero."
12571520,12573240," This is straight up failure."
12573240,12575880," This is straight up failure."
12575880,12576800," So it's going to be error."
12576800,12578500," Position."
12578500,12580240," At position of the input."
12580480,12581220," And the description."
12581220,12583180," Description."
12583180,12585420," Expected."
12585420,12587680," Expected."
12587680,12588600," Any."
12588600,12589480," Char."
12589480,12591320," Character."
12591320,12592580," Hmm."
12592580,12593920," That's very interesting."
12593920,12596200," Otherwise."
12596560,12597280," We should."
12597280,12598460," Return that character."
12598460,12599020," Right."
12599020,12601120," So."
12601120,12601720," And."
12601720,12602840," How are we going to do that?"
12602840,12605020," Might as well actually save that thing."
12605020,12605240," So."
12605240,12605600," N."
12605600,12606700," Is going to be this."
12606700,12609320," What are you doing?"
12609320,12610020," I'm."
12610020,12611920," Developing this thing."
12614640,12615420," All right."
12615420,12620920," So."
12620920,12621700," And."
12621700,12624700," The output."
12624700,12625360," Is going to be."
12625360,12625780," String."
12625780,12626240," Get."
12626240,12626940," Zero."
12626940,12628400," Input."
12628400,12629200," Text."
12629200,12632540," And the rest of the input."
12632540,12633020," Is going to be."
12633020,12633480," Sub."
12633480,12636360," One."
12636360,12638420," N minus one."
12638420,12639680," N minus one."
12639680,12641140," Input."
12643140,12644720," I think something like this."
12644720,12645820," This is how any."
12645820,12646360," Char."
12646360,12647180," Would look like."
12647180,12648540," Um."
12648540,12651240," Yeah."
12651240,12652900," But you still do a comparison."
12652900,12653360," So."
12653360,12655720," The point would be."
12655720,12657440," To get rid of the additional comparison."
12657440,12658540," With this bracket."
12658540,12659340," In the prefix."
12659340,12661000," But you still do a comparison."
12661000,12662040," Uh."
12662040,12664760," By checking whether the string is empty or not."
12664760,12666820," You still do that."
12666820,12668680," But at the same time."
12668680,12670240," Maybe we shouldn't try to do that."
12670240,12670760," Because."
12670760,12671900," Essentially."
12671900,12672620," What we can do."
12673080,12674700," We can just try to return that."
12674700,12675540," And."
12675540,12676060," Uh."
12676060,12677260," If the string is empty."
12677260,12678180," That will."
12678180,12679260," Uh."
12679260,12680240," That will."
12680240,12680680," Uh."
12680680,12681660," Throw an exception."
12681660,12683220," And we can just call that exception."
12683220,12684860," Catch this exception here."
12684860,12686020," So."
12686020,12688160," Invalid arguments."
12688160,12690080," So."
12690080,12693880," And what's funny."
12693880,12695140," This is genuinely."
12695140,12696100," Could be faster."
12696100,12698920," This is genuinely."
12698920,12699620," Could be faster."
12699620,12699980," Because."
12699980,12701280," If it doesn't fail."
12701460,12702460," It's never gonna."
12702460,12703560," It's never gonna even do any."
12703560,12703920," Like."
12703920,12705240," Unwinding or anything."
12705240,12705880," It's straight up."
12705880,12706740," Just returning that."
12706740,12707000," So."
12707000,12708060," That could be faster."
12708060,12708640," But I mean."
12708640,12710580," You always need to check this kind of stuff."
12710580,12711760," Whether it's actually faster."
12711760,12712240," Just."
12712240,12712720," Or."
12712720,12713860," We just imagine that."
12713860,12715200," Because yeah."
12715200,12715880," So."
12715880,12718040," Uh."
12718040,12719400," So."
12719400,12719720," That's."
12719720,12719940," That's."
12719940,12720420," That's funny."
12720420,12720900," I see."
12720900,12721580," Okay."
12721580,12722160," Thank you."
12722160,12723300," Thank you for suggesting that."
12723300,12724280," All right."
12724280,12725640," So this one is not a fun."
12725640,12726280," It's a run."
12726280,12728040," No fun is allowed here."
12728040,12729020," Uh."
12729020,12729440," And."
12729440,12730620," Oh yeah."
12730620,12730960," And."
12730960,12731640," Yeah."
12731640,12732600," And."
12732600,12734580," It's gonna be a string."
12734580,12735580," Length."
12735580,12737020," Uh."
12737020,12738540," Input text."
12738540,12740620," Text."
12740620,12741980," Uh huh."
12741980,12743800," And."
12743800,12744480," Um."
12744480,12747660," Yeah."
12747660,12748880," We have to swap it around."
12748880,12751460," Uh huh."
12751800,12752160," All right."
12752160,12753340," So now it complains about that."
12753340,12753600," That's."
12753600,12754780," That's a very interesting parser."
12754780,12755200," Okay."
12755200,12755860," Thank you."
12755860,12756920," We'll test it out."
12756920,12758040," Uh."
12758040,12759180," We'll test it out."
12759180,12760480," But now I need to print."
12760480,12761480," The output."
12761480,12762020," The."
12762020,12763180," The result."
12763180,12763600," And."
12763600,12765680," There's no really good way for me to do that."
12765680,12766500," So I can show."
12766500,12767560," Uh."
12767560,12768280," Sections."
12768280,12769760," And what not."
12769760,12772580," I'll have to implement all of that shit yet again."
12772580,12772920," So."
12772920,12773900," Just give me a second."
12773900,12775400," Sections."
12775400,12776920," It's a single section of list."
12776920,12778100," And it will return a string."
12778100,12779860," And."
12779860,12780420," Uh."
12780420,12781300," What I'm doing here."
12781300,12781760," I'm just."
12781800,12782940," Taking sections."
12782940,12785580," And mapping it with."
12785580,12786120," Show."
12786120,12787260," A single section."
12787260,12788940," Then I'm."
12788940,12791260," Concatenating that."
12791260,12792540," String concat."
12792540,12794620," With."
12794620,12795480," These things."
12795480,12796340," Right."
12796340,12797420," And then printf."
12797420,12798460," Sprintf."
12798460,12801180," Uh huh."
12801180,12803380," S."
12803380,12804260," And that's."
12804260,12805600," It's."
12805600,12806420," Deriving show."
12806420,12806720," Yeah."
12806720,12808280," But you can't do that in a camel."
12808280,12810040," Without additional third party dependencies."
12811420,12811860," Um."
12811860,12812760," Unfortunately."
12812760,12814280," So."
12814280,12815780," I'll have to do that myself."
12815780,12817800," Ah."
12817800,12820460," I wish I could just do."
12820460,12821080," Derive show."
12821080,12821280," But."
12821280,12822580," Nah."
12822580,12824440," Uh."
12824440,12825040," Printf."
12825040,12825500," S."
12825500,12826000," Uh."
12826000,12826860," Printf."
12826860,12827200," S."
12827200,12827800," Printf."
12827800,12827880," Printf."
12827880,12829400," So."
12829400,12830080," Uh."
12830080,12830720," Name."
12830720,12831740," Is equal."
12831740,12832980," S."
12832980,12834280," Pairs."
12834280,12836500," Equal."
12836500,12837240," S."
12838700,12839420," Oh sorry."
12839420,12841440," Uh."
12841440,12841940," As you."
12841940,12843000," As can you see."
12843000,12844740," I'm not a Haskeg developer."
12844740,12846300," Uh."
12846300,12848400," Uh."
12848400,12848580," Oh."
12848580,12849200," I see what you mean."
12849200,12849700," Section."
12849700,12850860," Name."
12850860,12851880," And then."
12851880,12853300," Show pairs."
12853300,12855600," Section pairs."
12855600,12857020," All right."
12857080,12858000," So we're gonna actually."
12858000,12859120," Do it like that."
12859120,12860080," Hopefully."
12860080,12861040," It's gonna."
12861040,12862380," Work out."
12862380,12863760," Uh."
12863760,12864860," Show pairs."
12864860,12868120," Pairs."
12868120,12869040," Show pairs."
12869040,12869440," Um."
12869440,12872540," Pair."
12872540,12873360," List."
12873360,12874480," I think I need tea."
12874480,12875540," I need tea."
12875540,12876840," But I."
12877220,12878700," I want to finish this."
12878700,12886020," Pairs."
12886020,12887760," List."
12887760,12888220," Map."
12888220,12888940," Show."
12888940,12889880," Pair."
12889880,12890600," We're almost there."
12890600,12891100," By the way."
12891100,12892960," Uh."
12892960,12893680," String."
12893680,12894580," Concert."
12894580,12895560," This."
12895560,12897400," Printf."
12897400,12898320," Sprintf."
12898320,12901700," Uh."
12901700,12901720," Uh."
12901720,12904040," Shit."
12904040,12906180," Single pair."
12906980,12908320," I think it could be something like."
12908320,12909300," Key and value."
12909300,12927200," You think I don't know that."
12927200,12930100," Uh."
12936740,12945060," All right."
12945060,12947560," This pattern match."
12947560,12948980," Matches the value of list."
12948980,12949360," Oh yeah."
12949360,12949580," Yeah."
12949580,12950940," So it has to be like this."
12950940,12952820," Uh-huh."
12952820,12954240," Uh."
12961540,12962020," Ah."
12962020,12962520," Okay."
12962520,12962520," Um."
12962520,12965740," Can I do array to list?"
12965740,12967920," Okay."
12967920,12968200," Okay."
12968200,12968740," It worked."
12968740,12970600," And it also complains that there is."
12970600,12971360," Like it's not."
12971360,12973060," Uh."
12973060,12973660," Expected."
12973660,12977360," This match is unused."
12977360,12981700," What do you want from me?"
12984500,12985100," Um."
12985100,12985100," Um."
12985100,12985180," Um."
12985180,12986840," All right."
12986840,12987140," Whatever."
12987140,12990180," I don't know what it wants from me to be fair."
12990180,12990540," Like."
12990540,12991200," Um."
12991200,12994360," So I check whether it has this shape."
12994360,12995920," And if it doesn't."
12995920,12996560," Um."
12996560,12998640," I just don't care."
12998640,12999160," Like but."
12999160,13001740," Um."
13007740,13009380," This match case is unused."
13009380,13012700," Okay."
13012700,13013800," Oh."
13013800,13015440," Maybe it has something to do with this."
13015440,13016180," Uh."
13016180,13017340," Is that what you want?"
13017340,13019600," Uh."
13019600,13020100," Uh."
13020100,13021140," Yeah."
13021140,13021460," Okay."
13021460,13022060," It wanted this."
13022060,13023000," Okay."
13023000,13023560," I'm on the right."
13023560,13024900," Oh my god."
13024900,13025460," Okay."
13025460,13025680," Cool."
13025680,13027540," Uh."
13027540,13027900," So."
13027900,13029040," And when we have sections."
13029040,13029340," Right."
13029380,13030400," We're going to do sections."
13030400,13032560," Show sections."
13032560,13035200," And we're just going to print and align them."
13035200,13036240," Jesus Christ."
13036240,13037000," Thank you, Cameron."
13037000,13040580," I should also implement my own like show library."
13040580,13041980," Uh."
13041980,13043720," That serializes the type and whatnot."
13043720,13045120," The types and whatnot."
13045120,13046160," So."
13046160,13046720," Uh."
13046720,13047260," Ine."
13047260,13048780," Byte."
13048780,13052100," So expected path to an input file."
13052100,13054040," So then we can do something like example."
13054040,13054980," Ine."
13054980,13056120," Uh."
13056120,13056700," Test."
13056700,13057380," Ine."
13057380,13058440," And there we go."
13058500,13059600," We got what we expected."
13059600,13060120," There we go."
13060120,13062620," So I had to implement this kind of stuff myself actually."
13062620,13064180," Which is fucking ridiculous."
13064180,13064500," But."
13064500,13066300," Yeah."
13066300,13067020," So."
13067020,13068480," I got it."
13068480,13069800," Actually got it."
13069800,13070620," Cool."
13070620,13073700," So now I should be able to add that to the."
13073700,13074060," Uh."
13074060,13074800," To the quick start."
13074800,13076400," Um."
13076400,13079580," Thank you."
13079580,13080320," Thank you so much."
13080320,13081420," Quick start."
13081420,13082780," Uh."
13082780,13083840," Yeah."
13083840,13084980," It's going to be make."
13084980,13086020," Then."
13086020,13086500," Uh."
13086500,13087060," Ine."
13087060,13088100," Uh."
13088100,13088660," Native."
13088660,13090540," Examples."
13090540,13091560," Examples."
13091560,13092380," Is it examples?"
13092380,13093660," Uh."
13093660,13094160," Test."
13094160,13095080," Ine."
13095080,13098140," So this is basically why I was trying to do all of that."
13098140,13099080," Because I want something."
13099080,13100340," Uh."
13100340,13102880," That people can reproduce on their machines."
13102880,13104280," And it does work."
13104280,13104820," Okay."
13104820,13105580," Now."
13105580,13106240," Um."
13106240,13107680," Um."
13107680,13109680," Uh."
13112720,13113260," Okay."
13113260,13113320," Okay."
13113320,13115640," Document."
13115640,13116640," Reproducible."
13116640,13117800," Example."
13117800,13119000," Example."
13119000,13123060," I'm going to push that right into the repo."
13124520,13125780," And let's take a look at this."
13125780,13126620," Any char."
13126620,13128720," Will that break."
13128720,13129900," Uh."
13129900,13130580," The parsing."
13130580,13131980," So."
13131980,13132520," Uh."
13132520,13134060," If we take a look at the any ml."
13134060,13134720," And."
13134720,13135420," Uh."
13135420,13136600," Sections and whatnot."
13137220,13139720," So we can say any single char."
13139720,13140520," Right."
13140520,13141840," So any single char."
13141840,13143000," And."
13143000,13143400," Uh."
13143400,13144160," If we rebuild it."
13144160,13144940," And if we run it."
13144940,13146300," It doesn't break the parsing."
13146300,13147080," So."
13147080,13147520," Yeah."
13148480,13150900," And it is potentially faster."
13150900,13153520," But it's kind of difficult to verify that."
13153520,13154940," Whether it's actually faster."
13154940,13155840," Right."
13155840,13158040," But theoretically it could be."
13158040,13158780," Because it."
13158780,13160760," Like it doesn't compare anything."
13160760,13162140," It just takes the substring."
13162140,13162840," And that's it."
13162840,13163860," Right."
13163860,13165800," So."
13165800,13166180," Yeah."
13166180,13167940," So."
13167940,13168720," And."
13168720,13169240," Uh."
13169240,13171280," I'm going to commit this any char parser."
13171280,13175900," Implement any char parser."
13175900,13177380," There we go."
13177380,13178460," We're going to push that right into the repo."
13178480,13178860," The repo."
13178860,13179380," So."
13179380,13179760," Yeah."
13179760,13182700," You can find the source code of the thing that we developed today here."
13182700,13183540," In the chat."
13183540,13184700," Uh."
13184700,13186600," I actually developed it for myself."
13186600,13188000," Because I need it for one of my."
13188000,13189260," For one of my projects."
13189260,13192020," And it's going quite well so far."
13192020,13192780," So."
13192780,13193540," Yeah."
13193540,13196140," It's a parser combinator."
13196140,13197640," And the library."
13197640,13199700," The size of the library is actually very small."
13199700,13200920," Uh."
13200920,13204760," 147 lines of code."
13204760,13205540," Right."
13205540,13207240," Parser combinator library."
13207840,13209040," With monadic operations."
13209040,13210980," Combiners and stuff like that."
13210980,13211900," And it's quite cool."
13211900,13212940," So."
13212940,13213700," That was actually."
13213700,13215260," Pretty interesting stream."
13215260,13216820," But unfortunately."
13216820,13217580," Boys and girls."
13217580,13219320," It is time for me to go."
13220160,13220920," Thanks everyone."
13220920,13222460," Who's watching me right now."
13222460,13223760," I really appreciate that."
13223760,13225180," Have a good one."
13225180,13225980," And I see you."
13225980,13226860," Guess when."
13226860,13227960," Guess when."
13227960,13228680," I'm going to see you all."
13228680,13230260," I'm going to see you all tomorrow."
13230260,13231000," Because tomorrow."
13231000,13232020," According to the schedule."
