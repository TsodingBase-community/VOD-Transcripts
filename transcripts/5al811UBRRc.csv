80,5040," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session with Amista"
5040,10400," Zozin. So we continue working on Raycaster and TypeScript and this is our result that we developed"
10400,17680," in the previous session. It looks kind of cool. I really like it actually. But it's obviously"
17680,25280," lacking compared to what we saw in the tutorial, in the article in here, which inspired the whole"
25280,30160," thing. I'm gonna copy paste it in the chat for people online and obviously I'm probably gonna"
30160,36160," put that in the description as well. Right, so here they have screenshots from Wolfenstein 3D"
36160,42560," and also somewhere down there they also had textures and stuff like that. So today I would"
42560,48880," like to actually work on adding textures to the walls. I think it should be really easy."
49840,57280," uh famous last words right. So honestly I thought the same thing about um about raycasting in general"
57280,62240," and it got burned really really hard uh so it turned out to be way harder than I thought."
62240,68880," But I still feel like uh just adding textures should be still kind of easier right. So I can explain you"
68880,76320," why right. Because you can you can just use the standard texture technique right. So essentially if"
76320,83440," you're doing uh OpenGL or in and GLSL right so the shaders and stuff like that you have a texture in"
83440,91200," the memory right. So and usually you have so-called UV coordinates right. So you have U and V but I don't"
91200,96080," remember if V actually goes down or up but maybe it doesn't even matter right. So you have some sort of"
96080,102480," UV coordinates and they are normalized coordinates. So that means they start at one and this at zero and this"
102480,109280," is one and this is one right. So and essentially if you have some sort of a point on some surface the"
109280,116720," only thing you have to do is to normalize it to zero one and then pick a pixel out of the texture and then"
116720,124320," color uh that pixel on that surface that you want to you know map the texture to according to that right."
124320,129920," So and essentially um if we have some sort of obstacle in here right so this is basically the"
129920,136400," block we are looking uh top down at the block and we have a player and the player looking at the block"
136400,144000," and through this sort of ray we kind of know where exactly um the ray hits this entire thing."
144000,149920," So and what's funny is that I just realized that the cells are already normalized. They're already"
149920,156320," normalized that their size is one so that means we already kind of know the value from zero to one"
156320,163440," uh which column of the uh of the texture that we have to pick. Like this thing literally just tells me"
163440,169600," right away which column of the texture in here I have to pick and this is the thing that I have to draw"
169600,175520," instead of this stripe right. So because we are actually rendering things in in terms of stripes uh and"
175520,180960," the stripes actually have a pretty low resolution in here you can even kind of see them so let me"
180960,186320," uh wiggle around yeah you can clearly see how low of resolution I have in here right so this low"
186320,194480," resolution stripes I think even in the source code. If we go somewhere here in array caster index.ts"
194480,201360," index.ts I have a screen width so yeah so the width of the screen is 300 right so it's quantized like that."
201360,207920," So the actual resolution I think is 800 right so but I quantized it uh by by 300 divided basically."
207920,214800," So and because of this sort of logic right so that I laid down in front of you right now so I feel like"
214800,220480," mapping um you know texture should be easy right but you never know what kind of problems you're gonna"
220480,226480," encounter along the way right. So texturing the uh walls is going to be one of the objectives for today."
226480,232240," Another objective I would like to do is maybe fix the fucking controls because right now you're using"
232240,241360," WASD right so and to rotate I use A and D and this is like really really quantized and I can only make"
241360,245920," one steps and stuff like that. This is fucking annoying like how am I supposed to even play this"
245920,253680," kind of game so this is this sucks. The controls in camera fucking suck. What's interesting is that you"
253680,259040," you can actually test it out for for yourself right it is deployed on github pages it doesn't have any"
259040,264880," backend or anything like that uh just go to here and for people uh on youtube of course I'm going to put"
264880,270960," that in the description as well uh right so it's going to be somewhere here uh so if you're interested"
270960,279520," so it's basically WASD uh so another kind of problem that I have in here is that the array actually when it goes out of the"
279520,286480," bounds right as you can see minimap uh denotes the bounds right if you go out of bounds uh the entire"
286480,295120," scene kind of disappears and this is because of how our ray caster works uh so essentially uh if the ray"
295120,301680," for whatever freaking reason goes outside of this bounds it stop it stops the whole process right it"
301680,308880," basically stops the whole process which is kind of meh right i think uh i think we should allow uh seeing"
308880,313920," these objects even if you're completely outside of the boundary right so because it's kind of"
313920,320160," doesn't make any fucking sense right so we can denote this area as the area where you can place walls"
320160,324960," right and outside of this area you simply can't place walls but it doesn't mean that you can't be there"
325520,331600," right so why can't you be there i think you should be able to do to be there so the way we can do that"
331600,341200," um well we can basically disable you going there right uh or uh we can essentially modify our process"
341200,347680," so here we render a single frame so render a game uh so as we render a game we are rendering a scene and as"
347680,355200," we are rendering a scene we are casting a ray right so we have a special function called cast ray uh we"
355200,363040," are providing the scene right so and a scene is essentially an array of arrays of strings or nulls"
363040,370080," null denotes an empty wall and string denotes basically the color uh right so it accepts the player position"
370080,377360," and it also accepts basically where you have to go right so the array essentially and where are you going"
377920,384080," okay so let's actually go here um right and this is very interesting thing right so as you can see"
384080,392880," as we're casting the array we are doing all of that stuff in the in the loop in an infinite loop right"
392880,402240," so we are checking whether the array which is denoted by two points hitting a particular cell if it is"
402240,408400," hitting a particular cell we're checking that whether that cell is inside of the scene if it's not inside"
408400,415040," of the seal we stop the ray casting process if it's inside we stop it only when we find something on this"
415040,424800," scene uh right so what i'm thinking is that maybe we can basically change it like this right so if you are"
424800,434320," in a scene and uh this thing is not equal to null only then break so that means if the ray goes outside"
434320,440080," of the boundary of the of the scene it will continue going there but then i feel like we need to limit"
440080,446400," for how long you can actually go anywhere right so maybe we can have something like a limit right so it's"
446400,453520," going to be limit uh and we can say that you are allowed to only do 10 steps or something like that"
453520,459520," so let's actually limit this thing to 10 steps uh maybe we can even limit all of that stuff to"
459520,467600," a length right so to a particular length uh but as we casting the rate so you see what we're doing we"
467600,473760," have a special function which uh does a race step right so you we provide the ray and it gives us the next"
473760,480800," step so that we're kind of losing the beginning of the of the ray right so let me actually show how uh"
480800,490880," exactly we're doing all this um so i don't have a tablet so here's one point here's the second point"
490880,499040," uh i can denote this as one two so we have a procedure that given two points finds the next one right so"
499040,506880," finds the next one and this is the third point and uh right so we only keep the last two points in this"
506880,513440," entire process so one of the things we need to do we need to probably save the very first point at the"
513440,521280," beginning of the ray casting process maybe something like start right p1 and in here uh we probably should"
521280,537760," continue while the distance start to uh distance to um i don't even know to p1 is less than far clipping plane"
537760,547200," something like that you know what i'm talking about right so while the distance uh from start to p1 uh is less than"
547200,553600," this sort of limitation we continue doing that and we stop when uh we're inside of the scene and we find"
553600,558160," something that is not new so that seems to be reasonable so let me actually enable the fly check"
558160,565520," next error uh right so fly check mode which like always shows the errors and let's go ahead and maybe"
565520,571600," enable the watch mode do i have a watch command yeah i do have a watch command so that means i should be able"
571600,576640," to just go in here right so should be able to just go in here maybe i'm gonna start team yux and i'm gonna"
576640,584240," say npm run watch uh there we go so i have a watch mode so it keeps recompiling the the typescript"
584240,590000," every time i modify something right so because that's how it goes in web development watch mods and"
590000,595920," shit um it doesn't really serve anything because the the whole thing doesn't really require any backend"
595920,599120," but maybe in the future we're going to create something that is going to"
599760,605520," go into the watch mode and also serve uh you know like a web server or something like that"
605520,610000," when we need the backend maybe we can make it like a multiplayer game i don't know"
610000,621120," so anyway let's refresh this entire thing so now uh if i try yeah there we go so as you can see yeah"
623360,628400," that's kind of interesting that's kind of interesting so now i can actually go far away"
628400,633040," and it doesn't it's not it doesn't even slow down the whole thing that much right so it doesn't really"
633040,639840," slow down the whole thing that much so i can just go around the whole thing and go really really far away"
641520,655840," so interestingly we really the actual mapping of the distance to the strip to its height on the screen"
655840,663200," is really dependent on the height of the of the screen itself right so if we take a look at how we do all of"
663200,672240," that so um so ray cast it's not it's actually cast three and i think it's a render game there we go uh"
672240,678960," render scene it was called render scene so essentially in here uh what do we do the strip height"
678960,687120," is the height of the screen height of the canvas divided by the distance from the player to the wall"
688000,696320," right non-euclidean one right so but anyway so what that means that this thing is a fundamental the"
696320,703760," height of the screen is kind of a fundamental far clipping plane right so it is the fundamental for"
703760,712400," clipping plane what i'm thinking is that maybe we should pass it to cast array to stop the process right"
712400,721120," so how can we even do that uh maybe we can accept the canvas uh canvas rendering context right uh what"
721120,726720," emacs why did you okay so everything's defined so and instead of this kind of thing here we can say"
726720,735360," city x uh canvas canvas height something like this right so and uh let's go to the next compilation"
735360,741840," error so this is the next error so here here i have to pass city x and uh no more errors no errors in"
741840,750880," here okay let's refresh the whole thing and now if i just go away i can now go away as far as i actually"
750880,759520," i feel like it kind of it kind of slows it down now it really fucking slows it down"
759520,766720," yeah actually using the height of the screen as the limitation of this thing is a bad idea honestly"
768240,773600," right because as you go further away it really slows it down surprisingly it really"
773600,781200," fucking slows it down uh so let's not do that let's not fucking do that um okay so but but i mean it's"
781200,784960," kind of it's kind of good that i decided to experiment with that right so because like how else would they"
784960,791040," fucking know that uh right so let's not pass this entire shit in here and uh we're gonna have a far"
791040,797360," clipping plane uh far clipping plane was it is it equal to it's equal to 10 i think it's reasonable"
797360,804960," uh i think it is in fact reasonable honestly like i'm using distance 2 all the time and distance 2"
804960,811280," actually uses length which is which uses a square root and stuff like that but who said we can't have"
811280,818320," like a square distance 2. so the thing about square distance is that uh sqr distance 2. so it's going"
818320,826240," to be that vector 2 and this is the number uh right and essentially that sub this and we're going to use"
826240,835520," a square length and the square length is something that doesn't use the square root where is the length"
835520,841760," where is just a regular length yeah here it is so you can just say square length square length is"
841760,849920," just this but without the square root right but then you may ask isn't it incorrect uh isn't it"
849920,856560," incorrect yeah it is true uh but the thing you have to do now what you use a square distance but now you"
856560,863120," do not compare it to actual distance that you expect you now compare it to square of that distance"
864320,869120," and this is how it works out right so it's literally the same thing now right it's literally"
869120,875280," the same thing but it doesn't use square root which is relatively expensive preparation right it's a"
875280,881600," relatively expensive expensive operation that we'll have to do on each frame basically and maybe we can"
881600,886400," replace this kind of shit in all of the places where we use distance too like who like who said we"
886400,892160," can't do that uh right maybe that will speed it up uh but anyway uh so let me let me actually see so"
892160,900080," it's talking about some some so two to nine uh let me see so here i'm just passing passing some stuff"
900080,907360," that doesn't exist anymore and everything seems to be nice okay so does it work um yeah so now it cuts"
907360,911920," off everything and everything is super nice and it's actually really really fast and stuff like that"
913120,918240," um yes so yes so let me actually find all the places where we do distance too because i'm really"
918240,923760," curious if we can replace yeah i feel like here we can also definitely replace the distance too because"
923760,929200," we're doing only just comparisons we don't really need the actual distance we can just use the regular"
929200,937040," like like square distance uh okay distance two uh and that's it we don't use distance anywhere like we can"
937040,943840," just use the square distance why didn't i think about that i think i think that's uh that's pretty cool"
943840,949600," so people talking about equals equals equal six well did they use you know equals incorrectly or ah it's"
949600,956320," just like chat i'm talking about something i think i think i saw something no it's fine maybe i should"
956320,962240," actually install some sort of a linta yeah this one this one actually yeah this one is important"
963280,968000," it's quite still expensive i feel like it is still relatively expensive especially if we're"
968000,974160," talking about like games video games um i don't think outside of video games it is expensive but when"
974160,980480," you're calling it 60 times per second um and like not even 60 times per second but 60 times per seconds"
980480,987040," multiplied by some factor i feel i feel like it can add up i feel like it can end up but my puppy i don't know"
989600,996800," um but i mean like obviously you can just get rid of it and replace it with just multiplication and"
996800,1004640," addition just multiplication and addition was super cheap even like decades ago with many many decades ago"
1004640,1012240," like you why wouldn't it uh super cheap right now i don't know maybe maybe it's kind of dumb worrying"
1012240,1017040," about this kind of stuff but i i think it's nice i think it's nice it's kind of like a testimony to this"
1017040,1022080," approach um right because this approach was developed when there was no really that much"
1022080,1028320," hardware acceleration and it's sort of like a hack and it's like a good testimony like it's a good"
1028320,1033440," demonstration that yeah you can implement this approach without any like a fancy mathematical"
1033440,1039680," uh operations or anything like that right so we still use things like a sine and cosine uh right so from"
1039680,1045280," angle but in here i think i think i can i think i can also get rid of signs of consigns at some point"
1045280,1055120," but anyway anyway i digress so we'll get some stuff in here and uh what did i do so let's do a committee"
1055120,1065200," committee chat let's do a committee committee uh right allow the array to go outside of scene right i'm gonna"
1065200,1073120," push that uh right into the repo push that right into the repo uh we got some subs thank you so much"
1073120,1077600," nicolas danielion thank you so much for tier one with the message i saw you"
1077600,1084240," i don't know what that means but uh uh good good for you i guess"
1085200,1090880," a hector hsc thank you so much for 100 bits thank you thank you thank you um right"
1090880,1099040," uh i i've sped up uh stuff on actual recent hardware by removing square root"
1099040,1101840," oh okay so that that means this technique is still relevant"
1101840,1107680," like pre-compete sine cosine demos like a true low level coder yeah"
1108240,1117280," i think i i think i did that um off screen just like just for fun but i forgot how to do that so"
1117280,1122640," maybe like doing like a cycle sine cosine tables per computation would be interesting in the stream"
1122640,1129280," we'll see we'll see definitely still irrelevant i'm doing some stuff on the play date uh console and"
1129280,1135680," you have to be careful there interesting yeah i've never developed anything for like old consoles and"
1135680,1142640," stuff like that right on twitter uh pikuma account actually constantly teases me with his courses on"
1142640,1148560," like playstation one uh development for the games and for ness and stuff like that and like i never"
1148560,1153520," actually honestly never had any of this kind of stuff when i was a child and i never developed anything"
1153520,1157600," like that for this stuff but it sounds so fascinating i want to try it one day"
1159040,1168560," uh right so i really like the platforms that limit you in terms of what you can do because the limitation"
1168560,1178080," is what uh you know encourages creativity so to speak um right but anyway but anyway anyway so what i"
1178080,1184400," want to do i actually want to fix the way we control the character so right now the character is very"
1184400,1190160," discrete as you can see and we don't even play a proper animation right so let me actually show what"
1190160,1196800," is going on in here so we have a listener we uh have an event listener and when you press uh a particular"
1196800,1203120," key key down uh what we do we modify the state of the game and we just re-render the entire game and"
1203120,1208960," that's it we're not playing animation we're not updating updating um 60 times per second or anything like"
1208960,1215120," that uh so i think this is one of the things i want to fix first right so i don't remember how to do that"
1215120,1220800," so i think it's a window request uh animation frame okay so i do remember this kind of stuff"
1220800,1227760," right so and essentially this is like a set time out but for actual you know interactive applications"
1227760,1236320," right so it accepts frame request callback which is just um a function right which accepts the time which"
1236320,1242560," is a dom how rest time step um which is just a number but i don't remember what it is so we can"
1242560,1252160," actually take a look at the uh documentation for the syntax tab um dedicated worker okay dedicated worker"
1252160,1260320," global scope all right anyway uh where is the time warning be sure always to use the first argument or"
1260320,1264080," some other methods for getting the current time to calculate how much the animation will progress"
1264640,1271360," in the frame otherwise the animation will run faster on higher refresh rate screens okay uh makes sense"
1271360,1278880," makes sense i remember remember there was a gotcha um in terms of the um measure units of this thing"
1278880,1283920," so the callback function is passed a single argument a dome higher rest time step indicated the end"
1283920,1288960," of time frame rendering based on the number of milliseconds since the time origin yeah so it's"
1288960,1295120," not in seconds it's in milliseconds you have to convert it into fractional seconds yourself right so"
1295120,1302560," freaking web i i don't freaking know um so let's do this thing so this is going to be basically"
1302560,1309920," timestamp uh all right so and let's put it like this and um we also need to keep track of that like a"
1309920,1314240," previous timestamp right so previous timestamp right so previous timestamp is going to be undefined initially"
1314240,1324080," um and what i'm thinking is that uh what we're gonna do we're gonna just assign uh brief timestamp"
1324080,1333680," uh to the current timestamp and we're gonna request the next sort of frame uh request animation"
1334560,1342080," request animation frame i'm gonna say frame uh and the frame is going to be essentially a function"
1342080,1348400," maybe i'm gonna actually define a function like this so this is a frame uh and this is the timestamp"
1348400,1359760," like so and within this thing uh we are effectively um implicit any so it has to be a number yeah there we go"
1360320,1365360," so and afterwards uh obviously we will have to render the game and stuff like that"
1365360,1373280," so afterwards we have to do i guess it's fine so we're requesting the first animation frame in which"
1373280,1379200," we're getting the previous timestamp right so but we're not doing any framing here and then we are"
1379200,1384240," actually requesting the next frame and so on and so forth okay that's cool so it can't really get the"
1384240,1391680," ctx is not accessible um i suppose this is because you you have to use the fat arrow thing here right"
1391680,1398160," don't you i think that's the way to yeah i i think i remember so there is a semantical difference between"
1398160,1404000," the fat arrow lambdas and like functions and stuff like that so to get an access to like a local scope"
1404000,1408960," in here where ctx is defined you have to use a fat arrow uh what's funny is that what if i just do"
1408960,1414640," something like this is going to have problem no it's certainly fine okay it still can access this"
1414640,1419520," thing it's only when you do something like this it's when you can't capture ctx"
1427600,1435920," i like i i kind of i kind of tired ranting about javascript so but honestly uh to be fair closures"
1435920,1442960," uh in languages like c plus plus and rust are even more anal than this right because they are low level"
1442960,1450240," system languages where um you really have to be very precise about how things are accessed in the memory"
1450240,1456720," and the code and stuff like that so the stuff in the in the rust and c++ is even more anal okay whatever"
1456720,1462400," but at the same time this is a scripting dynamic language like how does that thing have any excuses"
1462400,1467360," i don't freaking know my favorite rst closes yeah the black ones"
1467360,1476720," so anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway what we're going to be doing in here what we're going to be"
1476720,1483600," doing here is um just re-rendering the whole thing right so it's just like a render the whole game um"
1484800,1490880," so here we just do that we clean the whole screen uh and so on and so forth right so that's pretty"
1490880,1496640," cool uh times oh yeah this one is very important uh right so what we have to do here we have to have"
1496640,1503840," delta time right so now we have a delta time um and a delta time is simply uh the current time stamp"
1503840,1508080," minus the previous time stamp but you have to remember it's in milliseconds you have to convert it"
1508080,1512640," into seconds right so we have to divide it by 1000. so and this is the delta time and i can't"
1512640,1519200," uh access this thing because it's okay so it's supposed to be either number or undefined right"
1519200,1524560," so what's up with that what's what's up with uh possibly undefined"
1528640,1537120," um okay so i have an idea what if i just say zero you got him fucking got him uh right so because"
1537120,1544400," we need to have like this extra frame to figure out the first time stamp so then we can continue"
1544400,1549760," computing the delta time right so and assigning it undefined is not going to work because that actually"
1549760,1556960," prompts us to constantly check whether it's undefined even though this code is kind of this code is kind of"
1556960,1563520," correct if you define the type like this the code is kind of correct if you think about it it's just"
1563520,1569680," the typescript kind of complains about it i think i'm starting there is a strong parallel between rust and"
1569680,1577760," time and typescript honestly right that script likes to reject valid javascript code anyway whatever it"
1577760,1586400," doesn't really doesn't really matter um so we get this kind of thing uh so yeah now we have an animation"
1586400,1593280," and if i just refresh whatever we have in here uh it's not going to change at all right so nothing"
1593280,1600320," changed as you can see nothing changed and this is because of how we control things uh so what we need"
1600320,1608400," to do i think what we need to do now is to basically introduce the direction vector right and not really"
1608400,1614560," direction vector but maybe a velocity vector or maybe some sort of indication that we're moving forwards"
1614560,1621040," right so we're moving forward maybe i'm going to have something like let moving forward and this is going"
1621040,1628800," to be basically initially false right so we're moving forward and so i feel like i need to get rid of all of"
1628800,1641360," these things um and if you press down key uh w we're going to say okay moving forward is true that's it"
1641360,1648960," so now i feel like i need to duplicate this entire thing and for the case when the key is up we're"
1648960,1656720," going to say that we are moving forward false so um and we're going to be passing that information into"
1656720,1665760," here all right so that means if moving forward if moving forward set moving forward modably"
1665760,1670480," what we're going to be doing we're going to be updating the position of the player right how we're"
1670480,1675440," going to be doing all that so we're going to take the position and we're going to add a certain thing"
1675440,1681120," so we need to have some sort of a velocity so we need to take the direction of the player and we need to"
1681120,1687520," construct a vector from an angle right because the direction is an angle okay so then we're going to"
1687520,1696800," scale it by the player velocity right so player maybe speed violence momentum divorce so okay so"
1696800,1702800," this is going to be speed and what's going to be the speed let's say one cell per second right so this is"
1702800,1711200," going to be one cell per second um so we scaled it like that and then we're gonna scale it by the delta"
1711200,1716240," time to be fair we can just multiply speed by the delta time and that kind of like compresses this"
1716240,1722480," entire thing so and then we can add it to the player position and that's the new uh player position like so"
1722480,1730080," maybe we can reassign all that stuff like this so is everything gucci is everything tamaguchi um honestly"
1730080,1743120," maybe um it would be better to have something like const player velocity velocity uh and in here"
1743120,1747200," so like basically i want to have separation like player position and player velocity"
1747200,1752080," so delta time and this is player velocity"
1752080,1759440," so you can see it looks nice you have player position player velocity scale by delta time and then reassign it"
1759440,1766160," and there you go you have a very good thing i think i think i do think so i do in fact think so"
1766160,1772080," and afterwards uh you render the state of the game right so you updated the game you render the state"
1772080,1777120," of the game and then you request the next animation frame all right so now if i refresh the whole thing"
1777120,1782080," okay"
1785040,1791680," uh so that was interesting so maybe we have to reduce the player speed what about like a quarter of the"
1791680,1799840," um of the of the thing right quarter of the yeah there we go so that looked nicer so what about a 10"
1799840,1803120," percent of the cell yeah"
1808960,1817440," okay okay so it's it's much smoother that's what i would say it's much smoother anyways uh so the next"
1817440,1824240," thing we need to do we probably need to introduce a thing like moving backwards uh moving uh backwards"
1824240,1830240," backwards it's also false so we're going to be assigning here so i suppose it's going to be s"
1831200,1835120," so backward so backward so this is s"
1835120,1847200," backward cool what i'm thinking chats what i'm thinking i feel like we have to create a player"
1847200,1855120," velocity which is going to be essentially zero uh do we have a vector to zero i do not fucking remember"
1856160,1863760," i do have it look at that apparently perfect so and if we are moving forward if we are moving"
1863760,1869200," forward what we're going to be doing we're going to be adding a thing to the velocity right so we take"
1869200,1877520," the player direction uh vector to from angle right so and we obviously scale it by the player uh speed"
1878880,1884400," and we just add this entire thing to the player velocity right so just add the the entire shed and"
1884400,1892000," reassign it like so now uh so it's it must be reassignable so it has to be like of course of course"
1892000,1902720," of course cool uh so now if moving backwards moving backwards we're adding this entire thing actually"
1902720,1911520," honestly honestly we can simply subtract it the same thing just subtracting the same thing just subtracting"
1911520,1918160," pretty cool pretty cool so now this allows us going backwards go"
1918160,1926800," we're almost there chat we're almost there we're almost there uh yeah moving backwards"
1928080,1933120," oh yeah so just like copy paste it a little bit i copy paste it that's fine we're not developing"
1933120,1940000," software for nuclear reactor okay it's fine to make mistakes if you're just farting around"
1940000,1946080," don't get to wind up about it don't get to wind up about the lack of the tests or anything like that"
1946080,1955600," again we're not developing software for nuclear reactor yet so uh anyway we can move backward forward"
1955600,1962480," backward backward and so on and so forth uh it feels like it feels too why is it so fast i have no idea"
1962480,1969440," why is it so fast but anyway so this is a player speed but maybe uh let me actually make it"
1969440,1974400," it's does it speed up or something"
1974400,1982640," no it doesn't feel like it's speed up yeah uh so let's make it sort of like this"
1985280,1988800," uh maybe something like one was fine looking here"
1988800,2002880," it's fine okay um so now what i want to do um we want to introduce other things"
2002880,2008480," uh it's accelerate is it accelerate i don't feel like it's accelerating if you look at the look at the"
2008480,2014400," minimap look at the minimap uh in the minimap it is not accelerating it is not accelerating it is not"
2014400,2019440," accelerating it's it is probably because of the perspective it feels like it's accelerated but"
2019440,2023600," in reality i feel like it is not uh right anyway"
2023600,2035200," so uh turning uh left and turning right so we're probably going to be introducing like an angular"
2035200,2041360," velocity or something like that i wonder if i can you know compress this entire stuff a little bit"
2042160,2047360," like so so it looks a little bit better hopefully uh right like so"
2047360,2056320," um a little bit better so we're going to be compressing this entire so now"
2056320,2067440," if i do key a i'm turning left because a is left right so that makes sense that i'm turning left and if"
2067440,2077680," a kd i'm turning right so the same thing is here when i you know unpress the whole thing but instead"
2077680,2083920," of true it's going to be false look at that so it is false now so here's the velocity and"
2083920,2092640," we need to have like an angular velocity somehow angular velocity uh which initially is going to be zero"
2092640,2097600," um right um right but depending on whether we're turning left or turning right or whatever"
2097600,2105760," uh we are going to be modifying it similarly to how we're modifying the player velocity so it would be"
2105760,2110320," it would make sense to actually call it player angular velocity right but it's too long so instead i'm going to"
2110320,2120880," rename player velocity to just velocity i think that's much better so uh here now turning left right so i'm"
2120880,2125280," turning left why did i call it like with a snake case like i keep forgetting like what kind of case i need"
2125280,2134640," to have in here uh so now angular velocity plus uh let me let me see"
2134640,2145200," all right so we are adding so what's going to be the velocity let's say it is going to be"
2145200,2157440," maybe maybe math pie like um 10 percent of the pie just the 10 percent of the pie uh and here i'll"
2157440,2162240," probably have to actually switch the the signs i'll probably have to switch the signs because i like i"
2162240,2166480," don't know which one is left and which one is right so the only way i can figure it out is to actually"
2166480,2173920," experiment but that's fine that's totally fine uh okay so let me let me see so we're gonna have player"
2173920,2181600," direction is essentially player direction plus angular velocity multiplied by delta time"
2181600,2187840," right and the delta time we divided by thousand right so that should be fine chat"
2187840,2192560," i know why it felt like it's accelerating"
2196480,2206720," okay like why random coming right why web doesn't just have a like a one function okay i'm an"
2206720,2212960," interactive application here is my function and give me constantly give me delta time so i don't have"
2212960,2215600," to do this kind of bullshit like it's just like"
2219200,2220320," cat cat fucking damn it"
2220320,2228800," cat fucking damn it web fucking web mate fucking web"
2228800,2246720," it it almost feels like the web um you know standardization committee whatever the fuck it is"
2247280,2256400," they're intentionally making things up to create a market for solutions for third-party solutions"
2256400,2265200," it's like honestly a lot of like frameworks that people are making they could go out of business"
2265200,2269120," if we just like standardize some things in the browser right it's just like"
2271680,2278400," i don't fucking know do the create like framework creators pay to w3c for them to like make shit"
2278400,2283360," fucked up so they they can fix it in their npm package or something like is that what's going on"
2283360,2287120," are the guys colluding with each other like what the fuck is going why it is like that"
2287120,2290160," so yeah creating more jobs it's"
2290160,2296800," it's so bizarre to me like i don't understand just fix the problems for fuck's sake"
2298480,2301920," anyways uh anyways anyways anyways anyways i'm sorry i'm sorry"
2301920,2311120," zozin is renting again i'm rotating and by the way uh shit's fucked up so it's actually the other way"
2311120,2316640," around right so it's actually the other way around and i think it should be a little bit faster so"
2316640,2324320," it's actually doing 90 degrees uh look at the left look at the right and uh yeah we also need to update"
2324320,2334480," the velocity uh so this is a now half of that yeah so that makes sense now"
2334480,2337040," yeah"
2337040,2350720," that's that is sus that is sus honestly i don't really know why it is like that maybe because of the near"
2350720,2358000," clipping plane i think the near clipping plate has to be way smaller so we don't see such bugs"
2358000,2361040," yeah i fixed it"
2361040,2367040," i fix it"
2367040,2371200," i fix it"
2374720,2382800," i fix it okay so that's pretty cool i wonder if we can like make um so sort of like a labyrinth"
2382800,2390320," and go through the labyrinth uh so and if honestly i think the rotation has to be"
2390320,2395760," even like slightly faster what about the whole pie what do we give it like a whole pie"
2397200,2398480," maybe it's too fast but"
2398480,2406240," yeah let's go we're going through this entire choice"
2406240,2414800," yeah that's pretty cool so we kind of figure that maybe maybe we have to like use a mouth or something"
2414800,2424560," mouse or something uh you see yes okay so what did we do in here so we"
2426000,2428400," mm-hmm"
2428400,2431040," let's say make the controls"
2431040,2436480," smooth with that make the control smooth and i'm going to push that right into the rhythm"
2436480,2443520," uh right into the rhythm all right so i'll register for an hour and um i would like to maybe"
2443520,2448960," make a small break and make a cup of tea and after the break we're gonna try to tackle the uh"
2448960,2454960," the next problem that we have in here is which is the lack of the textures right so it's kind of"
2454960,2461360," boring to look at just colors they're not even shaded shaded correctly honestly right so maybe"
2461360,2465520," this is something else we have to do it's kind of boring to look at these just solid colors i think we"
2465520,2472320," need to introduce textures and yeah so let's make some break and um okay so uh let's go ahead and maybe"
2472320,2476800," add shading to this entire size so i think i think this is what i want to do because right now without"
2476800,2483120," even shade without any shading it's kind of boring in my opinion just saying just saying just saying and"
2483120,2492560," to be fair adding shading is rather simple task right so just um just color think"
2492560,2502560," stripe different or maybe shade the stripe um if it's too far away honestly we can already kind of use"
2502560,2510480," the um stripe length where is the stripe length uh height it's not length it's a height yeah we can"
2510480,2520320," already use stripe height like this uh-huh so in essentially so this is the distance if the distance"
2520320,2528480," is bigger and stuff like that but um so this is a stripe height i might actually use a stripe height to"
2528480,2537040," sort of dim this thing away the problem here is that the color in here is represented as a string"
2537040,2546720," right so look at that color is a string or null so it's basically sort of like a style um so i need"
2546720,2554640," to somehow extract the components of the core and modify the color does javascript have like anything"
2554640,2563840," to modify colors and stuff like that does anybody know or you literally have to have the um like a"
2563840,2574800," separate package for this kind of so does anybody have answer like omg uh so what what's that answer"
2574800,2581680," like how do i interpret that so is there anything standard within you have to parse the color yourself"
2581680,2589440," um so encoded as a tuple bra so yeah i probably have to introduce something like um"
2590720,2595280," maybe like a class and this is going to be color all right and in here we're going to have rgb"
2595280,2604160," number g b a right and i'm going to actually maybe treat them as normalized right so i'm going"
2604160,2610160," to be treating them and then by the way i don't know can you just have things like this you can't"
2610160,2618000," really you like you can't do that well i mean that kind of violates the principle of typescript that"
2618000,2622800," you can just like remove some things and it's going to be javascript so you can't do this kind of in"
2622800,2628880," javascript so that kind of makes sense okay sure fine fine uh so we're going to have a constructor"
2628880,2637600," constructor rgba so and all of these things are going to be basically numbers and this one is going"
2637600,2642800," to be a number and in here i'm going to just take this entire thing and i'm going to use a little bit of a"
2642800,2659120," emacs magic emacs magic emacs magic emacs magic so fucking sorry uh can you just do something like um"
2659120,2672640," um to maybe string or something like that by the way uh this format what are the ranges of rgb and a"
2672800,2681200," does anybody remember because i remember having like a trouble with properly using this kind of thing"
2681200,2690080," and um 0 to 255 yeah yeah yeah but for a i remember that a was kind of an exception"
2690800,2696800," yeah this is what i remember rgb 0 to 50. can anybody tell me why"
2696800,2707600," i'm gonna start ranting about web again like i'm gonna start why"
2707600,2712000," web why can't you be normal like"
2715440,2723280," delta time in milliseconds instead of the fractional seconds this shit can you be just"
2723280,2727200," fucking normal you can tell why okay tell me please"
2727200,2734800," uh the web does a little trolling yeah so"
2734800,2743360," the web does a little trolling uh so anyway so what i want to do in here is just like maybe return this kind"
2743360,2748320," of shot like that so it's gonna be a gba and here we're gonna just do a little bit of this kind of stuff"
2748320,2759680," uh so and obviously here is going to be just this a uh right so imagine actually uh creating like a"
2759680,2768960," variable called nuts and then somewhere in the body you can say these nuts oh i'm sorry anyways so in"
2771680,2777120," in here uh what we're gonna do we're gonna do this r and i suppose since it's normalized we need to"
2777120,2782880," multiply it by 255 right so we're gonna multiply it by 255 but it could be fractional so we have to do"
2782880,2791680," something like a math floor uh like so and there we go so uh does it look good does it look gucci does"
2791680,2797840," it look at tamaguchi i don't fucking know mate i don't fucking know it looks horrible looks horrible"
2797840,2807440," can i you know do something like this i want to split this shit uh into like several things like so"
2807440,2817440," uh so now this one is gonna be something like that uh so then later i can probably maybe put it like that"
2818400,2824800," so this is the closing thing and i can put it like that boom and this is another closing thing and i'm"
2824800,2827440," gonna put it like that uh boom"
2827440,2834480," does it look gucci i think it looks tamaguchi maybe you can even put it like that"
2836720,2846960," why can't alpha b integer 2 i have no idea honestly like listen test stuff like i freaking know how it"
2846960,2855120," works uh i want to um maybe test the whole thing uh so let me refresh this entire stuff i'm gonna go to"
2855120,2864880," the dev tools uh and i wonder if i can just simply create new color yeah i can create new color so here"
2864880,2872480," i can do um you know one zero zero one right and we automatically created the color so this is c and then"
2872480,2878560," i can do two string uh yeah and this is what we got so it seems to be all right and then i can just like"
2878560,2884960," pass that to different places and everything that's pretty cool that's pretty cool so and"
2884960,2891360," now if i have a scene i can now say that scene is an array of array but it's actually colors not the"
2891360,2896480," strings so i'm gonna go through the compilation errors in here so instead of like a field style i have"
2896480,2904480," to do something like to string and the next compilation error is uh to string maybe we should call it to style"
2904480,2915520," yeah um maybe we should call it to style so to string uh and let's square replace to string to style"
2915520,2920080," i think i like it a little bit better because i'm gonna be calling it explicitly anyway uh right"
2920080,2926320," so this is a scene uh size scene uh i see what's going on in here i see what's going on"
2927280,2934320," uh so honestly that kind of crazy situation what if i want to like use standard calls and sheds"
2934320,2942160," i want to be able to just use standard calls and shit um i have an idea what if i uh just do a little"
2942160,2950080," bit of stuff like this right i'm gonna say color and let's create like a custom constructors for all"
2950080,2956320," of these colors in here you know you know what i'm talking about you know red green blue yellow"
2956320,2964480," purple cyan all right so we can just go ahead and fork and do that so red uh is gonna be a static one of"
2964480,2972560," course it's gonna be color and we just return new color one zero zero one right and we can just repeat"
2972560,2981280," that for green and blue like so so this is blue"
2981280,2989600," so who remembers yellow who remembers yellow is it red green is that yellow"
2991680,3000320," chat chat chat chat chat chat chat yeah red green so purple is i remember red blue"
3000320,3015840," purple red blue and cyan uh cyan i think green yeah yeah i think that's what it is right so i think i"
3015840,3022560," didn't fuck it up all right so no errors no compilation errors i'm gonna refresh oof okay"
3022560,3031040," uh all right so that's well i mean at least it correctly identified some shits uh so correctly"
3031040,3036480," identified some shit so if i take a look at this scene uh i don't really have a scene globally anywhere"
3036480,3043280," so if i take a look at this where is the scene uh i can take this scene and maybe i'm gonna move it"
3043280,3051200," somewhere here like so all right and if i refresh this entire stuff so we have scene"
3051200,3058640," uh-huh and then some of the places of this scene right so we have colors and for some of the colors we"
3058640,3067840," have this kind of stuff we have this kind of stuff uh-huh so and then yeah if i just do"
3067840,3081600," maybe something like zero two scene uh zero and scene two and then two style does it give me"
3082880,3091200," yeah that is not correct even though this thing have rgb but when i convert it to style"
3091200,3100240," it all ends up being zero so two style is incorrect uh-huh i see why that is understandable copy pasting"
3100240,3109440," there we go uh so i think i think it works i think everything working yes so yes so we figured"
3109440,3121360," everything out pretty cool so which allows me to now uh modify the brightness honestly i kind of want to"
3121360,3129360," use a similar trick that is used a similar sort of like a design api design that is used by radi uh to"
3129360,3135200," have some sort of a method like a brightness brightness which accepts like a value parameter uh right and"
3135200,3141840," returns a completely new color and stuff like that so um but we need to know how exactly raylib does all"
3141840,3146160," of that so i'm going to go into the mutualizer where i have the source code of raylib and let's actually"
3146160,3153360," go inside of this entire thing uh and go into the raylib.h so there was a color brightness if i'm not"
3153360,3160960," mistaken right so it has a factor i think it's a good name so let's call it a factor so this is the factor"
3160960,3168320," okay uh it accepts the color and the factor so the brightness um correction brightness factor goes from"
3168320,3174960," minus one to one that is good all right so let's do a gripping a little bit about gripping uh grab rn"
3174960,3181440," so where is the implementation uh so there's okay so this is the one that we're interested in uh-huh so"
3181440,3186880," we clamp in the factor okay that's cool so then we're taking uh this kind of stuff if this thing"
3188000,3196640," is less than zero right if it's less than zero we're actually adding one effectively like inverting"
3196640,3204320," this entire thing and then we're multiplying it by factor uh otherwise if it's that or okay so that's a"
3204320,3210880," very interesting way of doing that so we're effectively just scaling like the entire thing okay"
3212560,3220960," we are effectively scaling so if it's negative we're scaling it down that's a very interesting way to do that also"
3220960,3225600," okay"
3225600,3236560," so do we clamp them afterwards uh we don't even have to clamp them all honestly right so because of the"
3236560,3240880," they're bigger than that they're gonna oversaturate they're gonna oversaturate"
3240880,3250160," to be fair i think if this is how you control the brightness we might as well just"
3250160,3262320," um i don't know i want to have like a thing that yeah let's just like do a multiplication um so i'm"
3262320,3270560," gonna have my own factor not not the same as in is in raylib um so essentially which is gonna do new"
3270560,3280480," color this r this g this b and this a but these first three things are gonna be multiplied by that"
3280480,3287040," specific factor and we're gonna just return it like that so and whoever calls this function is gonna be"
3287520,3293920," aware of how this works so it basically scales the rgb right it doesn't touch a"
3293920,3300240," it only scales rgb so this is what it's gonna be doing and i'm gonna call it brightness because i mean"
3300240,3306880," like i don't really know how to call it else so uh when we are rendering the game where we are rendering"
3306880,3311600," the game by the way how many times we render the game uh so there should be only one yeah so that's"
3311600,3318080," correct we'll only render it once so then we're rendering the scene and uh in the scene we just"
3318080,3323760," have a strip height and the cool thing about the strip height is that you can always just divide it"
3323760,3330800," by this thing right so you just divide it by this thing um and that is basically the factor but by which"
3330800,3338560," you have to sort of adjust the brightness what's funny is that if you substitute uh this entire thing like"
3338560,3347360," a strip height with its value you will notice that you kind of cancel out this and this and what you"
3347360,3354000," end up with is just like one over the distance of the between the player and the wall right so that's"
3354000,3359040," the value by which you have to adjust the color so and effectively what we can do we can just say brightness"
3360000,3370240," like this so i wonder if it's going to work um so but yeah anyways let's give it a try um and it work"
3370240,3379600," that's pretty cool that is pretty cool and i wonder if yeah so if you super close"
3381760,3389840," that it that looks nice honestly does it look nice uh right it's like a fog it's more like a fog"
3389840,3397600," but i'm not sure how how good it is i'm gonna leave it as it is i think i think it's pretty cool"
3397600,3400480," i think it's pretty cool yeah boy"
3406720,3414000," okay so let's do committee committee and maybe even a push a push i think there was a name for this"
3414000,3421920," kind of thing like a phone lighting no phone is not that uh phone lighting so let me see i forgot the"
3421920,3429280," name uh you can do sigmoidy stuff maybe maybe i could do some money stuff phone reflection model yeah i"
3429280,3437520," don't think it's a phone ring lighting maybe it is really lighting because yeah so it's more like a"
3437520,3448160," diffuse it looks like this maybe yeah it's definitely not phone by the way this looks like a solid"
3448160,3455280," streaming topic i i swear to god why i never actually explored it i think i tried to explore that uh in a"
3455280,3460320," like a past long time ago before i was actually like you know archiving my streams and stuff like that"
3460320,3467600," damn i should do a stream on that i should do a stream like write some shaders that do the"
3467600,3473760," like a phone reflection model and stuff like that yo yo"
3473760,3482160," yeah so but uh i looked into that stuff long but it was a really long time ago like it's it's before the"
3482160,3487520," sodding daily channel where i was archiving all of my streams and stuff like that um right so because"
3487520,3492320," of that a lot of stuff lost i actually throughout my streaming career i looked into a lot of things"
3492320,3502720," but a lot of them just like straight up lost unfortunately um right simple lighting based on"
3502720,3512960," distance all right and i'm gonna push that right into the repo right into the repo just a second"
3512960,3526000," all right so let's go ahead and continue so now we need to um add the textures to our entire renderer"
3526000,3532800," right so and in here it's kind of interesting oh this one is interesting so in here they're doing"
3532800,3540240," like a cell shading or something or don't they uh let me find let me find yeah yeah so this is sort of"
3540240,3545680," like a cell shade they're probably using normals or something like that uh that's a pretty cool idea"
3545680,3554720," honestly it's just because you have you can just like a straight up use angle uh between like the"
3554720,3564320," direction of the player and like a normal of the of the thing to sort of decide uh how bright or dark"
3564320,3571920," the whole uh surface has to be right so but i don't like i don't really know how to implement it"
3571920,3576240," like off the top of my head like right away i have to do a little bit of math and maybe i'm"
3576240,3579360," going to do that a little bit later because now i want to kind of work on texturing"
3579360,3588240," a second screenshot looks like my tablet 3d yeah i mean which one there's a lot of screenshots in here"
3588240,3593280," uh oh you mean the one where things are warped just a second let me yeah this one"
3594480,3598720," here's an example of what happens if the camera plane isn't perpendicular to the direction vector"
3598720,3602560," the world appears skewed yeah that's that's very interesting"
3602560,3613360," those jaggers are killing me hopefully we can add some aa at some point uh maybe uh so"
3613360,3622320," you mean let me actually find this ones um we can probably increase the resolution"
3623600,3625760," so let's actually increase it twice"
3625760,3635200," it feels like a little bit yeah so there's still a little bit of a of this stuff um but yeah you know"
3635200,3641840," what we can do so right now the way we do that we actually feel rectangles um a render scene"
3641840,3647040," what we literally do feel erect on each stripe"
3648160,3655920," what i was thinking to do is to maybe render everything into image data somehow right um pixel"
3655920,3660800," by pixel right like maybe into the byte array sort of speak then construct image data out of the byte"
3660800,3670880," array um and then like use that image data like a slap it onto the canvas and let the canvas do the scaling"
3670880,3677120," and the aliasing and stuff like that so this is what i was thinking um at some point but but to be fair one"
3677120,3683280," of the other ideas that i had for this raycaster is to maybe then port it from canvas to diffs"
3683280,3689280," imagine like implementing raycaster that renders all these things with diffs right because it's it's just"
3689280,3693920," stripes right so they're just stripes right so they're just stripes so you can actually do the stripes with"
3693920,3699200," dims just for fun right so that would be actually kind of fun"
3702160,3708720," um so anyway uh we need to load some images so let me actually see what kind of images we can have in"
3708720,3718240," here um so let's do maybe it's sorting pog it's not really sorting pog it's sorting pog uh so let me"
3718240,3725360," actually copy paste this entire thing so it's a sorting a pooger a poogie a woogie uh so i'm gonna create"
3725360,3733600," in images and in here i'm gonna just download my sodium pog um so okay so i probably have to rename"
3733600,3742800," it to sodium pog png all right how do i load this entire into into the web i suppose i have to do"
3742800,3755040," something like uh index html all right and maybe simply image uh src i think i vaguely remember how"
3755040,3765360," to do that right so i can just do it like that images uh sorting png sorting pog png like so"
3765360,3770880," right and then in this specific place in this specific game"
3770880,3779840," okay so i enabled the um you know the color inversion the color inversion specifically because"
3779840,3784720," of this article uh because it didn't have any style so it was too bright"
3784720,3790400," i wonder if this color inversion thingy is going to actually affect uh this entire stuff"
3790400,3797920," uh right so i wonder if it's going to affect this entire stuff so i wonder if i can do like a style"
3797920,3806080," uh display none right because i don't really want to uh display that at all so it's going to keep"
3806080,3815600," it in the memory hopefully uh and then i'm going to go into the in here um so maybe we need to have"
3815600,3822080," something like this certain pog so and if i go to here"
3827520,3834000," certain pog do i have it okay so that's cool can you have image data or"
3834000,3843920," yeah get uh i don't know how easily i can do with that but anyway so this is the like an image tag"
3845600,3855600," um this is like an image tag what i thinking that somewhere in the libdom ts uh stuff like that right"
3855600,3866640," libdom ts stuff like that we probably um have a definition of a class for the image tag so let me"
3866640,3871920," actually maybe go there i want to just like go here so this is the entirety of this thing so do you have"
3871920,3878720," an image uh maybe html image yeah this is what i was talking about uh provide the special properties"
3878720,3884960," and methods for manipulating images and stuff like that so does it inherit anything so just in here is"
3884960,3890320," the html element so it's not particularly that interesting uh so you can check whether it's complete"
3890320,3895120," which is whether the object is fully loaded right so maybe that's going to be important for us uh so"
3895120,3905520," we can have height and stuff like that so uh loading uh name natural height sizes src not that interesting"
3905520,3914320," decode um so i don't really know what the fuck is a decode uh and so on and so forth all right so i"
3914320,3921440," don't really see anything particularly useful for the just tag uh i also remember that there was just"
3921440,3934320," like an image thing somewhere image um so canvas draw image uh so you can draw images to canvas image source"
3934320,3944320," html html image bitmap uh video element image bitmap so this is a height width"
3944320,3951760," i remember there was like an image data yeah so here is the image data canvas image data"
3951760,3957920," so you can create canvas image data but can you create it"
3961600,3971280," all right so let's actually google up let's actually google up um so javascript get image data"
3971280,3978320," yeah get image data somehow so let's actually go to google uh i remember doing it once so yeah you can"
3978320,3988000," get the image data from the canvas uh but can you just get an image data of an image so here is the image data"
3988720,3994240," uh represents uh represents the underlined pixel data of the area for canvas uh so this is the data"
3994240,4004240," which is a clamped array which is okay so that's totally fine uh image data for from your okay so people"
4004240,4008720," google that get image data url in javascript okay"
4016720,4030160," so you can create oh yes this is a canvas oh i i vaguely remember i vaguely remember that you have to do"
4030160,4040000," something something like that so file encoder my image draw image to you oh my god yeah so"
4042240,4047760," load the image new image so there was a class image right so i see in the chat somebody saying there's"
4047760,4057920," some sort of a class image new image uh all right so okay all right all right right so you you then create"
4057920,4068720," image uh this kind of thing you do src but then to get the data of the out of this thing i have to draw it"
4068720,4075680," on the canvas do you understand correctly that i have to draw it on the canvas i think i vaguely"
4075680,4080320," starting to remember that i think i vaguely started to remember that you literally have to draw it on a"
4080320,4088720," separate canvas uh image and load then get the data okay so let me let me see"
4091280,4102160," so html image element right so on load uh but i don't really see"
4102160,4112160," yes so the image itself doesn't have uh yes you struggled with this in the past and determined that"
4112160,4126560," you need a canvas i was surprised to learn that as well where did i do that does anybody remember"
4126560,4138320," what was the project what was the project where i did all of that um something about yeah like"
4139920,4148480," let's actually go to the past blast to the past uh so ray casting so we probably need to go to all of"
4148480,4160320," them emote gem maybe maybe it was a no gem so let's actually see but maybe not uh so for this"
4160320,4162320," who doesn't know emo jam is this thing"
4162320,4174720," right emote gem i think in in case of emo jam you i could just like use image right i could just use"
4174720,4181920," image to bind the image into the jl cell texture and that worked fine i didn't need to have the"
4182480,4189120," individual pixels right in in in in the javascript itself right uh it's just like a webgl makes it"
4189120,4194800," super easy to just bind it to the texture and jlsl and in the shader you can already do whatever you"
4194800,4203840," want game of life and js yes i think you just remember yeah so i think it was something about um"
4205120,4214960," automata right in typescript specifically um so let me see can i actually have a search where i can"
4214960,4226000," specify the language okay so delay oh my god this is so slow typescript oh oh my god that is the slowest"
4226000,4233360," shit okay okay autocell yeah yeah thank you so much thank you so much thank you so much uh autocell autocell"
4233360,4245760," and autocell uh if i remember correctly brother github is insanely slow and i'm gonna keep writing again"
4245760,4254560," i'm sorry it's just like this is a glorified file manager it has no business being this fucking slow"
4255600,4264800," we had file managers in 90s like bra even remote ones it's a glorified remote file manager"
4264800,4273680," um that's just like i don't know so this is basically autocell it was trying to derive like a"
4273680,4281280," you know cellular automata cellular automata based on the image right it was just like"
4282000,4286640," um getting some statistics like with the surrounding neighbors and stuff like that it was kind of a"
4286640,4289680," weird experiment so i didn't really know it was particularly successful but"
4289680,4294720," we did some interesting stuff in here uh right we did some interesting stuff so stb images"
4294720,4304080," we even did that uh i think one of the oh yeah one of the things i did in here is"
4305680,4314880," i just loaded the image as a blob i just loaded the image as a blob i think and yeah okay so html canvas"
4314880,4317520," html image"
4320960,4329920," so just a second image yeah i think what i did in here i used the stb image directly"
4329920,4334720," i just remembered i i just remembered"
4337120,4347120," uh so so essentially what i did i just loaded the image as a blob i loaded the image as a blob and then"
4347120,4354400," uh i just did that so people you you keep spamming this thing like use images like is this even relevant"
4354400,4358160," to what i want using what i want using images guided images to draw"
4358160,4362640," bro you do"
4362640,4372800," i i i don't want to accidentally insult person it's just like"
4382800,4390080," moving calm down this person is just clueless but yeah they just want to help they don't understand"
4390080,4398960," what you're trying to do they're just clueless don't get mad at them okay everything's fine every"
4398960,4400960," everything's fucking fine"
4400960,4406720," anyways"
4410080,4416320," um simple line graph um simple line graph"
4416320,4426400," okay so um"
4426400,4434240," uh no but now there's no reason to ban this person we're trying to be a you know acceptable we're trying"
4434240,4440000," to be in like understanding we're not trying to lash on people just for not fucking understanding what"
4440000,4445680," the fuck is going on the screen we're we're just trying to be nice we're trying to bring positive"
4445680,4450320," vibes into the industry you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about that's that's"
4450320,4456880," totally fine that's totally fine anyways uh so one of the things we probably want to do uh is um"
4456880,4463840," um let me maybe put that in the description somewhere here so this is basically auto sell"
4463840,4470960," what we did the whole like series on the center i think um it's there framing an image it is there but"
4470960,4477360," i mean i didn't see anything like it's just like where is the framing an image"
4481120,4501280," where is the manipulation of pixels and i don't see where is the manipulation of pixels and i don't see"
4501840,4506720," where is the manipulation of pixels uh get that i didn't see manipulation of pixels"
4506720,4516240," all right so get another troll okay uh i think that image could be used there is a slice method where"
4516240,4522880," you can specify what parts of cut this is actually interesting idea movie max uh this is actually an"
4522880,4529760," interesting idea but to be fair i also want to be able to control the brightness of the of this stripe"
4529760,4536320," strip yeah strip uh because we we have lighting and stuff like that right so"
4536320,4544800," we have lighting and stuff like that so anyways so uh let me let me close the chat it's just like"
4548240,4550560," let me try to think"
4550560,4563920," because like i i remember i already explored that but it's still very difficult for me to comprehend that"
4563920,4571920," it's like i just can't don't want to accept the fact that yes that's like that's how you get the"
4571920,4576560," pixels of the image in javascript it's just like it's so painful for me to comprehend that"
4577200,4582880," i just like i don't want to do though all right all right those didn't come down those didn't come"
4582880,4589680," down everything's fine uh yeah yeah so you you really have to create an actual small canvases and"
4589680,4597840," shit like you really have to fucking do it um okay so i wonder if i can do that entirely in devtools"
4597840,4604560," so i can experiment and stuff like that um so where is my thinking okay new image"
4606240,4617360," so if i just create an image image um cool so image src and i'm gonna say okay uh images"
4617360,4621120," sodin poll sodin pog png"
4621120,4629600," all right so here's the image and can i just see the image itself in here so if i"
4630800,4638080," oh okay it doesn't really display it per se um"
4638080,4648480," does that mean i can like literally put anything in here and it will oh okay okay so"
4648480,4655280," so if something is incorrect it would like literally tell me okay can i create a new canvas"
4656480,4666320," uh right so uh right so document uh create uh element and i'm gonna create a canvas"
4666320,4675840," right i'm creating a canvas and that's my secret uh canvas canvas so this is my secret canvas"
4676560,4683920," okay cool so in the secret canvas uh canvas can i just set width to image"
4683920,4691040," width let's actually see what's the width of the image what's the width of the image okay so that is"
4691040,4698080," correct by the way and this is also correct so that's pretty cool uh so secret canvas secret canvas i"
4698080,4704880," didn't want to do that i'm gonna set it's width to image width and i'm gonna set its height to image height"
4704880,4707680," to image height"
4707680,4710480," all right"
4710480,4711520," cool"
4711520,4719280," uh and the secret canvas i suppose i have to get the context right because otherwise i can't really draw"
4719280,4728240," anything there right so i kind of have to do that so and in here i can say secret uh ctx so we've got a"
4728240,4740960," secret uh secret ctx so here um this is not how we spell it secret ctx draw image"
4742000,4752000," and what do we have to specify i have to specify the image zero zero okay secret ctx"
4752000,4757520," um get image data"
4757520,4762080," const image data"
4766080,4788720," uh so zero zero um image width image height"
4788720,4790720," uh"
4790720,4796720," uh"
4796720,4797200," don't"
4797200,4803120," we're trying to bring positive vibes into the industry"
4803120,4807360," even if even if people who design this entire shed are dumb"
4807360,4810160," we are accepting them for the way they are"
4810160,4815040," because they probably had good intentions when they designed all that stuff"
4816320,4819120," they also probably got paid shit ton of money"
4819120,4823600," and i'm eating rice every day every day"
4823600,4832320," i still accept them for the way they are i i forgive them we should learn forgiveness you know"
4832320,4838960," we should learn forgiveness they were they were probably thinking about security"
4838960,4844080," right so the the safetyness the safetyness of the internet and stuff like that they they"
4844080,4848240," probably have good intentions so yeah"
4848240,4854640," anyways uh let's go ahead and bring the http sir"
4854640,4860960," so anyway"
4868720,4875440," uh you're so wise i know i know i forgive all of the stupid morons who made decisions who make my"
4875440,4878720," life miserable it's fine i forgive all of them"
4878720,4883360," so uh anyways"
4887840,4894240," so what we can do i suppose we can just like run python or something like python three uh since i"
4894240,4898240," kind of understand what the is needed to be here so i can probably even"
4898240,4905680," just to retype this entire stuff so in the actual typescript so i already basically figured"
4905680,4910800," it out right so the only thing that stopped me is course right so i might as well actually start"
4910800,4917280," typing it in here so let's do new image right so and this is my new image"
4919920,4925440," uh you know what we probably have to do like some async choice so uh let's go ahead"
4925440,4929920," i mean it's totally fine right i still figure it out right so the fact that"
4929920,4934640," and i encountered course right it doesn't really stop me for it"
4934640,4938560," yeah so i still gathered enough information um"
4939280,4948080," load image data so here we have um url which is going to be a string um and we're gonna have an image"
4948080,4955120," data in here right so this is something like that um and so i just create an image"
4955120,4960000," const image uh like this and this is image src"
4961280,4976960," um um so image src uh and this is url i suppose now the thing we have to do um is image on load"
4976960,4983200," right so we have to do something like image on load and in the image on load we have like a global event"
4983200,4990960," and stuff like that um and yeah i understand that like i have to probably promosify this entire thing"
4990960,4998160," yeah i think time uh i think time so maybe i'm gonna google that uh javascript a load image async"
4998160,5004400," so let me see how to do that so sync away in image loading yeah so what's the what's the"
5004400,5011120," right way to do that uh 2024 developer survey is here and we would like to hear from you"
5012320,5019840," oh do i have to have like a account for to do that i don't have an account so hello thank you for"
5019840,5025280," taking the 2024 stack overflow developer survey the longest running survey of software developers and"
5025280,5033680," anyone else who codes on earth that's not very inclusive excuse me did you think about people on"
5033680,5041920," marts or in a space they probably also code disgusting anyway there are seven there are seven"
5041920,5046960," sections in in the survey the second third and fourth the section will appear in a random order"
5046960,5055440," uh basic information blah blah blah okay so let's go uh you consent to providing your information to"
5055440,5062560," help us stay privacy compliant okay your participation uh"
5065920,5072080," thank you for participating you're welcome uh cool so we took the developer survey stack overflow"
5072080,5077840," developer survey so hopefully the information i provided to them actually helps to to improve the"
5077840,5086640," service anyways so um yeah how do you do that that's that's very interesting um new promise result ah"
5086640,5095360," that makes sense actually that makes sense yo that's that's pretty cool so we can promosify i'm gonna keep"
5095360,5105680," it open in here i i'll i'll do that a little bit later so um now um so image in the image i probably have to"
5105680,5114320," also create a canvas right so this is going to be a new html canvas element like so and in a canvas"
5114320,5122960," we're going to set the width to image width set the height to image height and then uh what we're going"
5122960,5132640," to do we're going to actually draw yeah we need to take the context as well so uh city x um canvas get context"
5133440,5143360," 2d all right so in here we're going to draw an image 0 0 and show me the uh so you provide"
5143360,5152160," the image just the image and we can do zero zero all right so what's up with this so this thing can be"
5152160,5159360," well i mean technically okay so it may return no yeah i do realize that but i mean so what kind of browser"
5159360,5171760," does not support the 2d canvas in 2024 excuse me excuse me uh right so city x equal null uh we just do"
5171760,5183920," throw new error what kind of browser in 2024 does not support 2d canvas"
5185520,5189680," brah that's that's everything i have to say in here runs it's like"
5189680,5195040," brah are you still using me six"
5195040,5207440," anyways um links maybe links but i mean um links is probably gonna fail at the very beginning in here"
5207440,5217520," already um so anyways um what do we have why does it complain by the way so image uh an object which"
5217520,5228000," is possibly null for real are you telling me this thing may return null do i have to specify no"
5229440,5234960," uh i don't know what the fuck you're talking about it's not accessible of the type event so you want me to"
5234960,5243280," uh-huh it implicitly has type any uh yeah i don't freaking know what it's talking about but what we can"
5243280,5249920," figure it out a little bit there okay so and essentially in here um i can finally get"
5249920,5256640," image data all right so and when i get image data i have to specify the full size in here which is"
5256640,5263200," understandable so image width and image uh what kind of constructor returns no yeah i know right"
5263200,5270800," but and i don't even see that it really returns null uh so if we're looking at this kind of stuff right"
5270800,5281440," it doesn't return no like for real so i don't see it at least uh so here is something there's a image an"
5281440,5292640," object which is possibly null um yeah anyway so now what we want to do is probably promissify the whole"
5292640,5298320," thing all right so we're probably going to return new promise so if we're going to be doing async right"
5298320,5306720," so this is going to be async function um honestly yeah so now we have to make everything async um"
5308320,5313760," now we have to make everything i think a mode is a property ah yeah i'm sorry i'm gonna do okay okay"
5313760,5319680," uh yeah it's just like doing stupid stuff stupid fucking mistakes man i know"
5319680,5328560," here we accept the function that does resolve uh reject right so resolve reject and in here we just do"
5328560,5336880," this stuff this stuff this stuff like that uh right so unload once we get everything right once we got"
5336880,5339920," everything right so uh-huh"
5342240,5352160," we are resolving this entire thing so just like uh resolve like this cool is that how it's going yeah"
5352160,5366640," on error reject image on error reject so that's cool so and in here um i don't freaking know"
5368240,5377040," so i suppose i think sucks yeah i think sucks indeed we might as well just return the promise uh like"
5377040,5382080," this we can just return the promise and that seems to be working that seems to be compiling doesn't like"
5382080,5392320," this thing uh expect it uh i see that's totally fine so maybe now i can just try to do a sync and you're"
5392320,5399040," gonna be fine uh so it says something uh the return time of a sync function or method must be"
5399040,5407520," global promise type did you mean the problem yeah i did okay so it's kind of like you you're forced to"
5407520,5417040," have it as a promise oh so all right so i think i figured it out isn't it cool isn't it cool i think it's"
5417040,5425600," pretty freaking cool so yeah so on each image load we're like um creating like an entire html element"
5425600,5432320," and the canvas and 2d canvas and stuff like that and hopefully uh once we're finished all of that it's"
5432320,5437600," not going to stick around in the memory and it's going to be cleaned up and stuff will it be cleaned up and"
5437600,5445600," stuff right so this kind of setup is this kind of setup like you know safe right for from the memory"
5445600,5452480," consumption point of view because maybe some of the uh you know callbacks are going to keep pointers to"
5452480,5457760," the objects so they're never going to be garbage collected you can refine sync keyword uh as it is a"
5457760,5468320," sugar for a new promise ah okay it's even a sugar that's pretty funny uh but i want to keep it anyway"
5468320,5469360," i want to keep it anyway"
5469360,5477200," uh so whatever um so we have this kind of thing so one thing i want to do now"
5477200,5483360," is probably refresh the thing that we have in here all right so where is my"
5484240,5491200," array casting so there we go so now we have a function load image data um come on come on"
5491200,5500880," brav brav brav brav brav load image data uh-huh let's go so and here we're gonna just have images"
5500880,5513840," sodium png sodium pog png not pnmg yeah illegal constructor on load okay so that's kind of cool"
5514480,5522880," uh illegal uh illegal constructor uh i'm an idiot so yeah so it has to be document create elements"
5522880,5532000," canvas all right are we fine so there's no errors in here and i'm going to refresh this entire thing"
5532000,5542080," load can i just do one of my previous things yes of course of course course of course course of course"
5542080,5556800," uh python 3 m http uh simple uh 69 or 69 um was it simple http um http server"
5556800,5569920," yeah i figured it out so now i can do localhost 69 or 69 oh would you look at that so for offline game i"
5569920,5578160," i need to have an http server thank you so much uh w3c really appreciate that uh really fucking"
5578160,5586240," appreciate that uh image data so we have this kind of thing a boom pending"
5586240,5598240," uh all right so can i just have yeah so probably want to do something like then uh data"
5599920,5609440," where is my cursor okay okay so it's it's probably it's too faint um console log data"
5609440,5622080," okay look at that we've got a literal pixels we've got all literal pixels how about that you"
5622080,5629920," int8 clumped uh clumped uh array and that is insane mindy fruit dude this is fucking insane"
5629920,5639520," uh pixels for real yeah we got pixels we hacked the system we hacked the system and got the pixels"
5639520,5648480," am i a real web developer now can anybody uh you know validate me i think i'm a real web developer now"
5648480,5651360," right i fixed the course problem and i got the pixels"
5651360,5656400," image reader loader"
5656400,5661600," as a professional web dev yes you are thank you thank you so much thank you"
5661600,5667280," anyways anyways anyways anyways so let's actually close this entire stuff so i i want to kind of make"
5667280,5673600," a small break right so after this web tree i really need to refill my cup of tea"
5674480,5682320," and uh after i refill the cup of tea we're gonna try to mess with the pixels all right okay so let's"
5682320,5689120," continue doing this entire stuff so essentially um what i need to do i need to update the definition"
5689120,5698400," of a scene i think uh right so now the definition of a scene um so scene it has to be something like a"
5699120,5705280," type scene right so as you can see here it's either color or null or here i want to have actually like"
5705280,5711440," texture or image data right so i think it has to be something like image data uh but i'm not really sure"
5711440,5716240," load image data so you return an image data and image data is just okay so that's actually perfect"
5716240,5723600," uh right so scene is either color or image data or null so we're gonna support both right i think i think"
5723600,5728160," we're gonna support both i'm gonna go to the compilation errors now and we even have compilation"
5728160,5735920," errors so that's kind of interesting so fly check mode it's like uh it was disabled so fly check next"
5735920,5742480," error there you go so this one is rather interesting because now we have to dispatch upon several things so"
5742480,5749200," it's either color or uh texture or like image data or null so in here i would actually say it's something like"
5749200,5758960," excel right so does javascript has something like instance of uh instant it literally has instance of"
5758960,5765920," is this java or something i i literally guessed it because i used to be a java programmer so it"
5765920,5774240," let me see this like see right so because i programmed in java in the past i kind of like"
5774240,5784000," know how it goes i didn't really expect that it's holy that's javascript okay i see i see uh right so"
5784000,5790400," instance of tests to see if the prototype property of the constructor appears anywhere in a oh and it's"
5790400,5797760," also prototype based in here oh my god my god okay i see how it goes i see how it goes"
5799360,5806480," all right so it's fine it's fine it's fine um so this is going to be cell uh all right so and essentially"
5806480,5814080," here the main complaint of this entire thing is that it's um yeah it could be either color or it could be"
5814080,5822000," either yeah so property to style does not yeah so either core or image so none of them have any of that"
5823120,5835600," so now um interestingly can you do something like this cell instance of color"
5835600,5847040," and it automatically like casts it into okay this is like a kotlin yeah kotlin not kotlin kotlin um right"
5847600,5859600," otherwise if cell instance of uh image data all right so image data kotlin what we have to do uh this"
5859600,5867280," one is rather interesting actually so oh this is a rendering of the mini map this is rendering of the"
5867280,5874160," mini map so this is actually kind of cool so we can actually do something like image uh maybe draw image"
5874160,5880000," right right so can you draw image you have to provide the canvas image source and what is a canvas image"
5880000,5894240," source uh no image data though so you can do image bitmap or and this is so bizarre why can't you just have"
5894240,5903920," image data in here right can i just say okay draw cell uh all right at that specific place"
5904160,5914560," or something like that just draw it just draw it and in here by the way so it's um you can specify"
5914560,5921840," the size and size in here is just one one uh just pass the image element directly in here but i don't have"
5921840,5929600," an image element that's the problem that's the problem so when i load the image when i load an image"
5930640,5937280," i do have an image element then i need to"
5937280,5946480," i need to pull it on a canvas so i can get its pixels and then i just return the pixel and i lose the image"
5946480,5956320," element so that means i need to have both image and the fucking image element right so if i want to do that"
5958720,5964800," i need to have both and it's really bizarre uh that i can't just do it i think okay so i think"
5964800,5969600," there was it was something like okay put image data"
5969600,5976880," thank god so you can just put image data into into this thing so"
5976880,5981280," all right all right so i think i think we're safe i think we're safe um"
5983920,5988240," and to do the two so what is a dirty x and dirty y"
5988240,5994400," i swear to god web people what the hell is going on with you"
5994400,6005360," why there's no sloppy x along with dirty x like why you're making up like stop making up"
6011440,6015520," like a charm x a strange x this is like"
6015520,6023600," dx dy but funny exactly so horizontal position x of the top level corner from which the image data will"
6023600,6033680," be extracted defaults to zero ah so horizontal which image in a destination canvas uh position of the top"
6033680,6042000," left corner from which image data will be extracted why do you call it dirty it's just src"
6042000,6054640," this is just src are you okay my friend yeah so why is like okay so this is destination and this is"
6054640,6062560," source so anywhere in like in any graphics library in any graphics framework this is destination coordinates and"
6062560,6063920," this is source coordinates"
6063920,6077760," i i forgive those people let's not get mad at them they just they just needed to feed their children"
6077760,6084560," so that's why they created job security for themselves right so i'm okay with people making money"
6087760,6090000," okay um"
6090000,6100400," so but what's interesting is that why can't i specify the destination size right so if i want to kind of"
6100400,6105680," like squish it and stuff like that why can't i do that that's that's pretty sad bro that's pretty sad"
6105680,6111120," bruv um so holy the fuck am i working"
6111120,6125040," uh okay um so anyway um i can i'm gonna try to to just do that so put image data so and this is going to be cell x y"
6125840,6130080," um and yeah i suppose it automatically defaults"
6130080,6136560," to the actual size right so and width defaults to the size of the so i don't even have to provide"
6136560,6141440," any of that stuff so i can just do it like that but then on top of that i would like to uh you know"
6141440,6148480," kind of resize it but the only way i suppose to decide for me is to do the translations and stuff like that"
6148480,6155040," so let's just let it be in here uh and we'll see how it will go okay so the next error uh the next"
6155040,6160800," error what we have in here so fly check next error so here is the brightness oh this makes sense on the"
6160800,6169600," if uh right so if it's a caller so we have to do something like cell uh cell uh instance of and one"
6169600,6175360," of the things i forgot to check and i all really wanted to check that so let me open this stuff up"
6175360,6182320," and let me open the dev tools the the the dev tools dev tools the the dev tools dev tools"
6182320,6194000," so for instance if i have something like null and i do instance of uh of class of uh color i suppose"
6194000,6199280," so it returns always false right so no always will return false on no matter what okay that's"
6199280,6208480," perfect so now what we're going to do so this is a puller right so and uh let's go uh and in here i"
6208480,6215280," don't really know what to do so maybe i'm going to just do throw new error uh right rendering of the"
6215280,6222480," textures is not implemented right so it's going to throw an exception hopefully so this is just a cell"
6222480,6228720," in case of a cell it just does that all right so that's pretty cool next error please i suppose we actually"
6228720,6233120," went through all the errors in here that's pretty cool uh honestly what we have to do in here is just"
6233120,6240160," like a cell instance of uh image data right so that's what we have let me find the uh the place"
6240160,6245760," yeah so this is the image data we have in here okay so i'm gonna sneeze by the way get ready chat"
6248240,6256400," it's a false alarm uh it's a false alarm um all right so everything seems to be fine and that's cool"
6256400,6266720," so let me now uh bring this thing in here so the scene goes um inside right so this is the scene"
6266720,6273600," that's pretty cool so the next thing we do we need to load sodium pog right so i'm going to say it's"
6273600,6282000," sodium pog and in here we're going to say load image data load image data and we just say images"
6282000,6288000," sodium pog png let it go but we have to do a little bit of an interesting thing in here so"
6288000,6294640," um let's replace blue with sodium pog so we're placing blue with sodium pog and"
6294640,6300320," surprisingly that just worked and does it yeah so it does have problems right but it doesn't complain about"
6300320,6306720," them surprisingly um so we can make it complain a little bit earlier if we just do something like"
6306720,6312720," this yeah there we go so it complains now about that and it says that uh it's a promise image data"
6312720,6318560," so we probably need to do a sync a weight in here right to sort of unwrap this entire thing but you"
6318560,6325920," can't do unweight in uh in not a sync function so expressions are only allowed within async functions"
6325920,6330720," and the top level of modules so i suppose one of the things we can do here is just say it's a sync"
6330720,6339280," and is that enough is that enough i think that should be enough right so can i do that stuff now okay"
6339280,6345120," that's perfect uh-huh i'm surprised this was enough like i thought i will have to"
6346000,6349440," yeah rendering of the textures is not implemented so 281 boom"
6349440,6357840," got it we actually reached that specific place we actually reached that specific place"
6357840,6366480," i'm surprised this was enough so in a top level of the in the top scope right in the global scope of"
6366480,6372720," javascript i can just take a sync function and just call it is that a thing i thought i thought it was"
6372720,6376240," illegal but apparently i can just have a sync function and just call it and it just works as"
6376240,6381520," expected yeah you can do that okay so i thought i would have to do something like document on load"
6381520,6385600," uh like document on load or something like that like okay"
6385600,6390240," um since relatively recently okay interesting"
6390240,6399920," okay all right all right i'm just not familiar like with the async model of javascript but i worked"
6399920,6408720," with the sync code in other languages um so anyways that's pretty cool it's funny how it managed to"
6408720,6415520," render some of the things right so it rendered these things and then it reached the textured one and it"
6415520,6422720," completely failed uh right that's actually kind of funny oh and by the way it didn't render the"
6422720,6430800," mini map let's actually go ahead and find the render game and in the rendering of the game let's disable"
6430800,6433040," rendering of the scene because i want to see the mini map"
6433040,6439920," honestly this is the funniest i've ever seen like what the is that"
6442320,6456640," uh what's funny is that i don't render the game so i can just like do this kind of stuff right look at"
6456640,6461920," that i can just move around uh i can also maybe in terms of like a mini map when i'm rendering the mini"
6461920,6471280," map i can increase the size of the cell right so i can just say okay zero uh let's say one i think that's"
6471280,6480560," a good one so uh how about five yeah something like that so the thing about them"
6480560,6489360," i think about that is that it doesn't even modify"
6489360,6493840," it's not affected by translations and scales"
6496240,6500080," it's not even affected by translation this is kind of bizarre isn't it i think it is"
6500080,6507760," so what's up with that so that means you like when you do put image data i want to read documentation"
6507760,6514640," about this function because i would expect this function to respect i suppose it just like"
6514640,6523760," substitutes the the internal image out of that can you construct an image out of the image data"
6525120,6529520," right so that's that's the real question i have so if i do ctx draw image"
6529520,6538480," and you have canvas image source you have canvas image source can you construct"
6538480,6544240," image bitmap out of this thing so image bitmap"
6549920,6554960," so it's just an interface image bitmap is just an interface but can you construct it so we have off"
6554960,6555840," screen canvas"
6555840,6561280," so it's an interface"
6561280,6565520," off screen canvas"
6565520,6568480," you know i'm thinking"
6568480,6572880," what if instead of image data i just use off screen canvas"
6573440,6580480," uh all right so all right all right how is that different from just canvas"
6580480,6585120," so you can just do on new off screen canvas okay"
6585120,6593120," okay bitmap renderer so again you can get the context or something"
6593120,6600320," um off screen canvas get okay you know what i think that's what they have to do i think"
6601600,6607440," event targeted it does event target what i have to do load image data"
6607440,6615200," i have to return off screen canvas you know why because in the off screen canvas if i understand"
6615200,6620960," correctly i should be able to get uh to get data right so because it's"
6625120,6628800," um so i can have off screen canvas rendering context to d"
6628800,6634960," and that's where i can get yeah i suppose this is what i have to return"
6634960,6640080," because inside of this thing i suppose i also will be able to"
6640080,6647680," to get some other things so and it's a canvas"
6649760,6653200," rendering so is it even yeah i think i think i should be able to do that"
6653200,6661520," there is a global create image bitmap uh create image bitmap i don't know how it's gonna help me"
6661520,6669520," uh create image bitmap image bitmap source what is image canvas image oh okay oh thank you so much"
6669520,6676160," this is okay so this is okay so this is much better than than whatever i was doing all right so image data"
6676160,6677680," thank you so much"
6680720,6694880," so now um so instance of so draw image um create image bitmap and we just provide a cell"
6694880,6699920," maybe we can just preemptively create it so inside of the image"
6700800,6708560," yeah so it's it's kind of um maybe it's too much to create it on each sort of frame maybe it is too"
6708560,6714400," much to create it in frame but i'm not 100 sure but anyway so x y one one so that should probably"
6714400,6723360," be fine so it complains about something uh no over no overload expects but overload so what's what's up with"
6723360,6736160," what's up with that um i don't see and oh yeah okay well it's a sync are you fucking sir no"
6743760,6751360," okay"
6751360,6761040," so i feel like i'm playing tetris honestly i feel like i'm playing charges with with this entire thing"
6761040,6767840," and it's just like it's it's kind of annoying it is kind of annoying options options is not going to"
6767840,6774320," improve anything uh it's like it's says that it's exactly a sync"
6774320,6782000," okay so you know what i'm thinking i'm going to maybe just say"
6782000,6786080," fuck that and i'm gonna render this entire thing like with the circle"
6786080,6790240," i do have a field circle right so this is a field circle"
6791200,6798720," and when i'm filling the circle i'm going to say so we have a center in here the center is located at"
6798720,6809360," vector x y all right and we probably want to add you know half so it is in the center right and the"
6809360,6817920," radius is going to be just half if i understand correctly right so this is that and that's about it"
6817920,6824640," so essentially so we're also going to have ctx fill style and the style is going to be let's say red"
6824640,6829280," so we're going to denote the textures with the circle uh right and we're going to figure out how"
6829280,6832800," to put the actual image in there a little bit later right so i don't want to actually do that"
6832800,6839920," uh right so let me let me see let me see let me see so where are we"
6839920,6844400," because it's not really that important it's just like it's literally a waste of time"
6844880,6849440," uh yeah so okay so as you can see it demonstrates that it's sort of like a texture"
6849440,6857120," sort of like a texture so render mini map render mini map when i'm rendering the mini map let's actually"
6857120,6865040," reduce it down to just that uh did it compile what what's going on why is it okay okay so it recompiled"
6865600,6875680," let's enable rendering the scene uh all right so now it it's dead uh and we can go here so here is the"
6875680,6886240," where's the other instance of yeah here it is um interestingly interestingly interestingly so if it's a cell"
6887840,6890400," we already we already kind of we already kind of can"
6890400,6901440," so we'll need this kind of stuff pretty much everywhere but i'm not sure i think i'm gonna just"
6901440,6910720," copy it for now right so i'm copying it for now uh and p is a rather interesting thing right because it"
6910720,6921600," represents the point that hit uh that hit the cell right that hits the cell so and c actually represents"
6921600,6930720," the thing that yeah c actually represents the that point in there so let me actually see what we have in"
6930720,6944960," here so we have the um you know the wall the cube we know this point this is c we know this point and this"
6944960,6956000," is p we need to figure out we need to figure out where it is where it actually is on which side sort of speak"
6957760,6970480," on which side sort of speak um what's interesting is that um difference if we do the difference between"
6970480,6975360," them so i probably we don't even need this kind of stuff maybe i'm i haven't decided yet but whatever"
6975360,6983760," we need that to figure out the strip height so that's totally fine so if i take p and i subtract c from"
6983760,6990560," that i subtract c from that uh if everything is done correctly if everything is done correctly"
6990560,6998880," one of the components of p is going to be equal to one one of them is going to be equal to one the other"
6998880,7004960," one is going to be the thing that we're interested in right we just need to ignore the one that is equal"
7004960,7011520," one all right the one that is equal to one all right the one that is equal to one uh so let me do something"
7011520,7019200," like this maybe we can even have a function that figures out that for us but maybe not whatever"
7019920,7031440," so we have t and if tx is equal to one uh we're interested in actually ty otherwise uh"
7031440,7040000," otherwise we're interested in tx right so we can kind of turn that into this ternary operator"
7040640,7051360," into this ternary operator and this is effectively um the x coordinate of the strip of the image that"
7051360,7065440," we have to take um so yeah um maybe we can even take like a difference between them right so"
7067440,7076880," minus yeah so it's sort of like a minus one and math abs and this thing is less than epsilon right"
7076880,7083120," because it's a floating point and stuff like that uh right and then we can say that this is like a u"
7083120,7093360," coordinate right and now uh what we have to do we have to multiply u by the width of the image data"
7093360,7100160," and that gives us the column within the image data that we have to render now like this strip sort of"
7100160,7105680," speak this strip so to speak interestingly"
7105680,7108640," interestingly"
7108640,7112160," if it was"
7112160,7121280," so i'm thinking about the idea that movimax actually suggested where i could just use it as a"
7123360,7134160," how is it called um as a atlas right so because i think ctx like literally allows you to draw an image"
7134160,7140800," right and you can specify the source image yeah so you can specify source destination and so on and so"
7140800,7147200," forth you can specify source destination and stuff like that and maybe this is what i have to do"
7148000,7155360," maybe this is what i have to do in here essentially uh so and since i can just do that i can just use"
7155360,7162240," um our my image data as a sprite i don't really need an image data i don't really need the bytes"
7162240,7167280," you know what i'm talking about chat you know what i'm talking about like we don't need bytes"
7168720,7173840," we don't really need bytes but we still need to do this kind of shit asynchronously"
7173840,7178960," uh right because that's the only way to load that image right um so"
7178960,7185200," maybe what we have to do here is just like return an image"
7189520,7196480," so this is image it's a html can i so html image"
7196480,7207280," elements right because when you're drawing an instance instance of ctx"
7207280,7215760," draw image ctx draw image canvas image source can be"
7218400,7225760," image bitmap html canvas element so it has to be html canvas elements the other html canvas element"
7225760,7230960," uh we don't need bytes where we're going exactly we don't really need bytes"
7230960,7236320," i'm just thinking what's going to be the best uh actually representation here so you have image"
7236320,7241840," bitmap image bitmap sounds like actually kind of cool because you also have create image bitmap"
7241840,7245040," right image bitmap"
7247440,7255920," let me see so and you have image bitmap source and image bitmap sources uh canvas image source which"
7255920,7256320," could be"
7256320,7266240," html canvas element so yeah all right so i think we can so we can we can figure out i have like i can't"
7266240,7273840," decide which image source do i want uh which image source do i want um so if i just say that"
7275600,7278000," like i can just return canvas maybe"
7278000,7291920," html canvas element right so here is that and because of that um i can simply return"
7291920,7301040," the canvas itself all right so let's go to the rest of the compilation errors uh next error uh strip is"
7301040,7308800," never used to whatever it doesn't really matter uh this one um the definition of the scene so scene now"
7308800,7318560," is not image data but html canvas elements all right the next error next error so that's it right so"
7318560,7325840," there's no errors anymore so everything's fine here okay that's cool uh so what that means what that means"
7325840,7332720," um you can use html image element directly i don't see it honestly where"
7332720,7335600," html image"
7335600,7342960," yeah so canvas image source does not include in html element yeah i see what you say what you're saying"
7345040,7351360," like the typings like the typings don't actually say that that's what's weird about all that"
7351360,7356960," you know what i'm thinking about like maybe one of those are like actually inherit"
7356960,7366800," oh for fuck's sake like i since it's not an image element my brain literally skipped oh my god"
7368400,7374240," like why are you like why are you dude why do you even need this type"
7374240,7380240," what is wrong with p with web people okay"
7380240,7385360," like"
7398400,7407440," what's wrong with p with p we promote positive vibes everything's fine"
7407440,7413600," drugs yeah"
7413600,7419920," anyway"
7423840,7427920," that simplifies everything um okay so"
7427920,7436080," okay let's go through the compilation errors uh next one"
7436080,7442400," so this one so that means i don't even have to like i don't even need any of these shits"
7451600,7458800," now what's interesting is that can i just say uh on load resolver is that something i can say"
7458800,7469520," uh yeah and it says something that you can't really yeah so it would be better to actually do"
7469520,7477360," that properly okay okay that's fine okay might as well even do something like this sure are you happy"
7477360,7485600," now you seem to be happy cool uh so next compilation error uh next compilation error next one okay so"
7485600,7493680," it's starting pog and this is the definition of the scene uh html image elements image element cool"
7493680,7498480," next compilation error next okay so that's cool everything's fine"
7498480,7506560," finally we nailed it down we nailed it down cool so now what i can say i can actually provide the cell as"
7506560,7513040," as it is in here uh and we're simply like filling up all of these things so this is"
7513040,7521440," basically the source and the destination and the stuff like that right so the first four and four"
7521440,7528880," parameters here is this one and this is the destiny oh this one is interesting right so because"
7530560,7536320," the first one the first one our source and the destinations are the second uh you know fourth of"
7536320,7542240," them so but we can do the following thing all right so we can just place this thing in here"
7542240,7549680," and we can just say that this is the cell okay cool um then what we're doing we're gonna say that"
7551440,7560160," the source the source the source the source um interestingly so this is the y"
7560160,7571440," so in terms of x it's a y multiplied by cell width right so that's that uh and this is x uh in terms of"
7572160,7577760," why it's going to be zero right because this is the square so we picked x we just picked x and we"
7577760,7584720," picked y which is zero which is fine which is going to be one but the height is going to be the full"
7584720,7595520," height of this entire thing and it compiles all right that is very interesting i think uh let me open the"
7595520,7604880," documentation for this and test of let me open the documentation and see uh right so the different yeah"
7604880,7610800," so there's this thing a coordinate on the top left corner of the sub rectangle of this source yeah"
7610800,7617680," so this is the source first as the source and then blah blah blah blah blah blah blah okay so that"
7617680,7622960," should be it by the way chat that should be it so if we did everything correctly so it should"
7623760,7632880," just work hopefully we'll see we'll see and it didn't work funnily enough funnily enough i know"
7632880,7640320," like it literally just doesn't render that that's funny um okay so let me take a look at the maybe error"
7640320,7651120," uh so but the instance of needs to be updated uh since it will not match the image element yeah yeah you're"
7651120,7660320," right instance of man why why typescript doesn't warn about this kind of is there"
7660320,7667440," any like tagged unions in typescript this is a like a huge you know gotcha in here"
7667440,7673200," so is there any proper tagged unit in typescript tagged unions"
7675360,7680640," how do you do them in general tagged union types in typescript there should be something"
7680640,7690800," uh okay so there is this thing uh cash kind i see and then okay"
7690800,7701440," move i see i see what you mean i see how you can do that all right so you you literally like to create"
7701440,7706240," the tag and stuff but but that means like i have to do a lot of like a paperwork in a sense that i have"
7706240,7712000," to define all of these interfaces first right so define all these interfaces then i have to move all"
7712000,7716800," of these things into their fields and stuff like that it's just like it's too much work kind of i could do"
7716800,7721840," that but not right now uh right is there any other model redux"
7723280,7728640," uh right but i i get the idea i get the idea how to do that it's it's a pretty interesting idea so i'm"
7728640,7734400," going to actually credit the person who who suggested it um yeah all right"
7736240,7746400," so let's see uh html uh image elements and what's the next one uh html yeah because it's a very error"
7746400,7752960," prone so we probably don't want to do this kind of model that's for sure uh we probably don't want to"
7752960,7757920," do this kind of model uh it's just like something that like i came out with at the top of my head"
7758640,7763120," uh anyways so everything seems to be compelling so now let's refresh"
7763120,7767680," oof oof and it's it's dead it seems to be dead"
7767680,7771040," did it crash okay"
7771040,7779280," okay i forgot to remove throw exception so i forgot to remove through accession but"
7780800,7787920," it already kind of like drew one sprite which is already very promising so it's it's a really good"
7787920,7789760," one uh so"
7789760,7798080," not bad not bad at all so we have textures and stuff so we have so simple"
7798080,7809200," yeah we did it so you know what's funny is that now uh we can actually fix this thing i feel like"
7809760,7817440," because we can do ctx draw image and uh we can just like literally draw that image right i feel like"
7817440,7825440," right so we can do cell zero zero actually not zero zero x y one one as you would do like anywhere"
7825440,7831360," so the compile it seems to be compiling and here as you can see even in the minimap we have the texture"
7831360,7838880," and that texture is rendered in here right so all of that stuff is rendered in here so that's actually"
7838880,7844240," super cool we can actually in uh like add more different modes in here so let's go ahead and do"
7844240,7851120," that so we probably need uh this thing so i'm going to copy paste it uh let's go into the images"
7851120,7861600," so how many of them do we need so um let's download that what's that so uh certain flush right"
7862160,7874080," certain flushed png uh so maybe i'm gonna bring the chats like two here uh so i can do stuff like that"
7874080,7880880," so then i can just like you know work with all of that more conveniently"
7881760,7889680," okay so okay so we have certain pog and another thing we need to do is certain flushed uh right so"
7889680,7899520," this is gonna be flushed uh and the second thing we're gonna put in here is sodium uh sodium flushed"
7899520,7907680," there we go so does it compile it seems to be compiling okay so now we have that uh we have both sodium pog and"
7907680,7914560," sodium flushed so what other things we need to okay zezin of course of cares of course copy where is the"
7914560,7924240," uh copy three uh so this is images um sodium zezin png boom"
7927040,7936080," and let's just add it in here and let's just add it in here flushed uh zezin and sodium is this"
7936080,7944720," uh compile it seems to be compiling and yeah we have so it's in zezin sodium flushed and pog"
7944720,7950400," uh so what else do we have in here at sodium gasm okay so let's actually add sodium gasm as well"
7951280,7963840," uh huh w get so is that images it's not images that we get uh sodium gasm png like so maybe we should"
7963840,7971040," add other emotes like not only sodium emotes um okay so this was that's kind of weird"
7972960,7976640," so i don't know yeah so this is weird"
7976640,7980880," uh sodium gasm png"
7980880,7990240," uh tf right okay so maybe we can do tf as well uh okay so i'm gonna download that then we get"
7990240,8000320," o tf png let's download that um so sodium gasm tf cool"
8002960,8012560," uh let's actually do something like this so it's gonna be gasm uh and i'm gonna move it you know"
8012560,8019520," i'm gonna put gasm maybe somewhere here so doing gasm uh and the tf is going to be somewhere here so"
8019520,8030800," this is going to be tf uh tf all right oh it's actually kind of funny so it works in a really funny"
8030800,8040480," way with um with transparency of those things so but overall it's kind of doing things oh my god"
8040480,8046720," oof all right i'm glad we actually tried to look into that it only works with like axes and shits"
8046720,8054640," it only works with axes and shits okay that's funny and like i can i i see what is going on in here"
8054640,8062080," right let's see what's going on we need to fix that uh it's just like depends on like different uh sides and everything"
8062080,8066800," tf is not even visible well tf"
8066800,8073120," it's really freaking funny yeah tf is visible right in here"
8073120,8081440," i think it is visible uh i i can imagine how the thumbnail of the stream looks like right now i think i think it's kind of cool"
8082800,8090400," so i think it is impacting cool um yeah so let's try to figure out what exactly is going on there"
8090400,8097520," uh right because we found a bug we found a bug and i think i kind of know what's up with that i think i"
8097520,8104240," kind of know what's up with that um so i think i also forgot to mention uh chris pocket thank you so much"
8104240,8112480," for twitch prime thank you thank you thank you we appreciate it um implementing 3d twitch chats and now"
8112480,8118960," not really i'm not really implementing that but maybe i don't know we'll see we'll see um okay"
8118960,8121600," draw image"
8125360,8133840," so i see what is going on so you have x we just check whether x is equal to 1 or not right if"
8133840,8141440," something is equal to 1 we're taking one thing if if not we're taking the other thing so in here i feel"
8141440,8147520," like what we have to do is maybe take the opposite of this thing so let me i'm already guessing like i'm"
8147520,8155360," literally guessing which is probably not a particularly great idea to do but yeah that was that was a bad"
8155360,8166080," idea so it's something about the the axis though interestingly interestingly we can see all of these"
8166080,8172880," sides of this one uh let's actually isolate one object in here so like where we can see it properly"
8173520,8179360," uh i'm gonna put sodium pog maybe somewhere like around here because i want to like have an isolated"
8179360,8186560," object uh um like around which i can go right so that's what i want to have uh all right so where"
8186560,8192880," is the sodium pog okay so here is the sodium pog and then in here so that works fine so this is probably"
8192880,8202000," like uh this is this is y coordinate right so this is y coordinate we're talking about and this is x coordinate"
8202640,8208480," and this is only one so it's only one side that is up right it's only one side that is up right it's"
8208480,8214560," only one side that is up so depending on the side we probably have to just like do slightly differently"
8214560,8222960," um so you fix something uh i i think so uh let me let me find where was that thing"
8222960,8231760," let me find where was that thing um i forgot instance"
8231760,8239600," instance of so it's an instance of so it's an instance of if i remove this thing if i remove this thing"
8239600,8246240," so what is going to happen does it break in some of the other places yeah"
8246240,8252320," aha it just switches around so it's only one side that is kind of fucked up"
8253200,8259360," it's only one side that is kind of fucked up um so"
8259360,8270320," yeah i don't really know how like what's up with this side so i know for sure that we have this thing"
8270320,8279040," right so that should work okay so if we're talking about this thing we have x equal to one and this one is"
8279040,8290560," equal to okay so what if i have this thing one of them is equal to zero i see okay okay so it's either one of them equal okay"
8292720,8295920," um let me let me let me think"
8295920,8298560," or"
8298560,8306480," uh this entirety of the thing is straight up equal to just zero how can i"
8306480,8311600," work around that it's not really negative values it's not really negative values it's not that"
8312160,8323120," so one of them is just snapped to zero or it's equal to one so there's like two cases in here um"
8326480,8336000," so basically tx is straight up equal to zero or tx is straight up equal to one"
8336000,8339360," or very close to one"
8339360,8347040," so maybe we can even do something like this so it's kind of a weird hack but i mean it's it's going to be"
8347040,8357920," fine uh trust me so i can do math abs uh is less than epsilon right so you have this kind of situation"
8357920,8360800," and ty"
8360800,8371760," ty is greater than zero so in that specific case in that specific case you want to assign u to ty"
8374000,8377360," otherwise you want to assign u to two x"
8377360,8385280," and initially your u is going to be equal to zero something like it's kind of a dumb hack and i will"
8385280,8391200," think how to make it a little bit better uh but it may actually fix for now"
8391200,8399440," yeah okay so all the sides are fixed yeah all the sides are fixed okay that's cool so"
8401280,8407360," yeah it's it's definitely a weird hack but i think it's fine i will think how to do better i don't"
8407360,8408160," think how to do better"
8408160,8416400," yeah and so and one of them is just colors so we support both uh textured walls and the colors"
8416400,8420880," all right so let me do a committee committee and maybe even pushy pushy"
8422160,8430400," um so let's quickly do that add support uh for textured let's actually say textured"
8430400,8439920," walls that's it and i'm going to push that right into the repo all right so um that was cool that was"
8439920,8446320," cool i guess that's it for today thanks everyone who's watching me right now i really appreciate that"
8446320,8452880," have a good one and i see you all on the next recreation programming session with ahu and mr azuz and i love you"
