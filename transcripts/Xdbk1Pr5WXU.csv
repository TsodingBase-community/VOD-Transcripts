880,7920," Looks like we're live. Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreation programming session."
7920,14320," How about it? Let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start the stream as"
14320,22480," usual. As usual. Hello, hello everyone. Welcome, welcome, welcome. So, Red Circle live on Twitch."
22480,29760," And what are we doing today on Twitch.tv website? Today we're doing music visualizing. That's"
29760,34480," right. So, I'm going to give the link to where we're doing all that. It's twitch.tv/starting and"
34480,38480," I'm going to ping everyone who's interested in being pinged. There we go. The stream has officially"
38480,44240," started. The stream has officially started. So, what I wanted to do today, I wanted to implement"
44240,51120," something that I've been wanting to implement for quite some time. But I didn't really have time,"
51120,57600," not a motivation to do that. Right. Hello, hello everyone. Welcome, welcome, welcome. So, essentially,"
57600,66320," what I wanted to implement today is a music visualizer. Right. So, an example of sort of like an equalizer"
66320,70880," music visualizer you can actually find in today command. Right. So, if you issue today command,"
70880,78560," there is a very old monster cat song. Right. So, this is basically what popped up in my head"
79680,86400," the first. Right. So, it's a very old song. Like, holy shit, it's nine years old. Right. So, something"
86400,92720," like this. Right. So, monster cat used to have like these kind of visualizations. And essentially,"
92720,99680," what they do in here, I think, is that they basically take the wave of the song and they split it into the"
99680,104640," frequencies and they just visualize the frequencies. Because that's like the most obvious thing you could do in"
104640,111840," here. And so, I wanted to try to do that. And that should give me an opportunity to actually, you know,"
111840,119680," explore Fourier transforms and stuff like that. So, I think that would be rather interesting. So, that's"
119680,128560," basically what we're going to be doing today. And so, essentially, let me let me take a look at the"
128560,140480," syntax. I think, yeah. I decided to call the project for music visualizer, Musualizer. I don't know."
140480,147920," This is just like whatever. Whatever. So, and I've got the permission from a very cool cheap tune artist"
148480,157360," by the name Null to use their songs for our experiments. Right. So, you can find all of the"
157360,164000," links to their socials and stuff like that by using the song comments. So, check them out. So,"
164000,170000," they're very cool cheap tune artists. For those who doesn't know, cheap tune is this kind of music that"
170000,177360," plays when you crack software with Cajuns. Right. So, if you were never familiar with the cheap tune, that's"
177360,184880," basically the easiest way to explain what it is. Right. So, we can actually maybe listen to one of"
184880,189840," the songs while we are going to be doing all of that. So, I wonder if I can just do DLC."
189840,198080," So, yeah, there we go. So, I need to make sure that it's not going to be super loud. So, this is one of their"
198080,205600," latest songs, I suppose. So, this is basically how it sounds. So, let me adjust the sound for myself."
205600,219200," So, and this is what we're going to be using for our experiments. So, let's actually get started,"
219200,224720," I suppose. I hope it's not too loud. Right. Let me see how we're going to do that. How we're going to"
224720,228560," organize all of that. So, essentially, what we're going to be using, we're going to be doing all of"
228560,236080," that in C, right? So, we're going to be using C programming language and for visualization, of course,"
236080,241840," and for working with the sound as well, by the way, we're going to be using Rayleap. So, let me actually"
241840,249360," show you. So, Rayleap is the library for making games and one of the things you want to be able"
249360,254320," to do with games is play sounds, right? So, you want to be able to play like different effects,"
254320,261200," different cues and also background sound. And because of that, Rayleap also capable of working with sound."
261200,266480," And this is what we're going to be exploiting today as well. Right. So, let me actually put that in"
266480,274640," description. So, this is Rayleap. Rayleap thingy. Ah, why didn't I actually..."
274640,286160," So, let's start working on Musializer, sponsored by Rayleap. Right. I'm actually not sponsored by"
286160,293040," Rayleap at all. That's how good of the library this is. Right. So, I'm very notorious for not using"
293040,299600," third-party dependencies. And I'm really skeptical of other people's libraries, like very, very much."
299600,306480," I rather prefer to implement my own thing. Imagine library being this good that I use it literally"
306480,313600," for everything. A person like me uses it for like everything. That says something about the quality of"
313600,325280," this library. So, yeah. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. Okay. So, let's actually start with the"
325280,335840," Hello World project. So, let's just like, you know, organize stuff. And let me try to do the usual thing."
337120,345600," And let's do the Hello World. All this entire stuff. Right. And I think it would make sense to"
345600,355280," maybe create a build script for this entire stuff. Ah! Man, like listening to chiptune right now kind of"
355280,361840," reminds me of old streams. Right. On my old streams, instead of like a lo-fi, I used to listen to like a"
361840,367200," random chiptune playlist. Ah! Then at some point, I stopped doing that. Right. Because I thought that"
367200,372320," maybe lo-fi is a little bit more calm and stuff like that. But it just kind of brings back those times."
372320,376720," I don't know how many people from those times we have in here. But I mean, you know what I'm talking"
376720,386400," about. Right. It's the old Zozin streams. Ah! So. Musualizer. Right. So, this is the... It's probably not the best name."
386400,393040," Right. Because like, how do you even spell this kind of thing? Musualizer. And we're gonna supply this"
393040,401120," entire thing in here. And I guess that's it. So, maybe we're gonna have some C flags. Right. For the C flags,"
401120,409840," I'd like to put maybe w all, w extra. And do we need anything else? Maybe not. Like, I don't think so."
409840,420960," At least right now. At least right now. And let's make this executable. And if I build this entire stuff,"
420960,426160," it should be building now. So, it's taking some time for some reason. Because maybe it's just like"
426160,434000," warming up some caches, you know. Warming up some caches. And let me try to start the Musualizer. As you"
434000,441360," can see, it says ""hello world"". Right. Okay. So, let's go ahead and turn this into ArrayLib application."
441360,450320," So, it's gonna be ArrayLib.h. And I suppose for now, we're not gonna try to create a window. We're gonna"
450320,458480," try to load up the sound. As far as I know, the first thing you have to do with ArrayLib to actually play the"
458480,467760," sound, is init audio device. Right. So, it's a separate sort of like subsystem in ArrayLib that"
467760,473360," you have to initialize. It's a separate subsystem. So, we're gonna do it like that. And after that,"
473360,477680," let's take a look at what we can have. So, as far as I know, you have sounds. You have a notion of the"
477680,482240," sound. So, you should also have something like load sound. There we go. So, you can literally load the"
482240,489440," sound from a file. Okay. So, this is going to be something like sound. So, what we're going to be"
489440,499200," loading in here. So, let's actually load up a different song in here. So, load the sound and"
499200,505520," yeah, let's actually go ahead and just try to build this entire stuff and run it. Okay. So,"
505520,515280," we have to set up the cflags and stuff like that. So, this is going to package config cflags array lib."
515280,523440," There we go. And that also requires the libraries and stuff like that. Right. So, let me see. So,"
523440,529760," this is going to be libs. And yeah, of course, we don't really have a, you know,"
529760,540880," development environment setup for this entire stuff. I run VLC from Emacs and I closed Emacs and"
540880,548720," that also killed VLC. So, that created a very awkward silence. Really sorry about that. Just a"
548720,554800," second. I'm going to bring it back. Don't worry about it. I wonder if, how can I, how can I reorganize"
554800,562800," all this? Maybe with PCM and FM, which is the file manager. So, program, mutualizer. Can I just like"
562800,572560," select all of these things and just make them? That's kind of difficult to do. Right. Where is the..."
572560,581600," Yeah. So, here is this stuff. Yeah. So, let's listen to something else. Yeah, finally."
582480,588960," Imagine using GUI applications in 2023. In 2023, the year of Linux on desktop."
588960,595520," All right. So, let's do tmix. And I'm going to go to mutualizer."
595520,604480," And let me set up the development environment for Ray Weapon here. So, and there we go."
607200,612080," You never used GUI before. I mean, I used browser. Isn't browser basically a GUI?"
612080,614720," Isn't it? I think it is."
614720,622720," All right. So, let's go ahead and do that. So, if I try to build this entire stuff. Okay. So,"
622720,629920," yeah. It seems to be working, but it cannot find all of these things, which is kind of weird."
629920,632800," This is because I made a mistake. So, this is supposed to be loops."
632800,638080," And yeah. So, now it complains about some other things."
639520,647760," And those things are basically, I think, glfw, right? So, lglfw. So, that's the first thing."
647760,657200," Also, we need math. We definitely need math. And ldl, apparently. So, that's another library that we need."
659280,669520," And pthreads. Okay. So, we managed to actually do everything. So, excuse me. So, we can try to run it,"
669520,675040," but I would like to print some information about the file that we just loaded. But I think it's not"
675040,682080," particularly necessary because RayLib is going to print this stuff for us anyway. So, let's actually do"
682880,699280," visualizer. Okay. Oh, data form. I thought RayLib supported flag, didn't it? I'm pretty sure it's"
699280,706400," a project flag. So, wait a second. That's kind of weird. So, RayLib, if I take a look at the source code"
706400,716160," of RayLib. So, what do we have in here? So, there was our audio load sound. So, here's the function"
716160,725760," that loads the sound. We load the wave from a file. So, let me see load wave. And the first thing we do,"
725760,731680," we load the data from the file and then we parse it with load wave from memory. And yeah. So, here we go."
731680,739040," So, it basically checks different extensions of files. So, wave, OGG, MP3 core. It supports..."
739040,747840," Is that the thing like a quite okay audio? It's like quite okay picture. What is this?"
747840,757840," It's sort of like a meme. Not really. A queen of audio. Oh, no. I was thinking about a different thing."
758880,766880," Remember how one post got viral everywhere about sort of like a custom picture format?"
766880,775440," That is super simple, but yet it's as efficient as a PNG or something like that. So, and yeah. I think"
775440,778640," it was something like that before audio, but maybe it's something else. I don't know."
779680,790400," Second search. So, did I miss it? Just a second. Okay. Anyways. So, flag. There we go. So, there is a flag."
790400,799280," But it only works if this thing is defined. Is this thing even defined? Can we just like grab..."
801680,815920," Oh. This is so funny. Excuse me. Fuck flag in particular. Like, everything is in it. Fuck flag."
815920,829120," Fuck that format. Why? So, can we blame this thing? Like, why did they disable that? That's so weird."
829760,837920," Um. So, show commits. Huh? Doesn't really show that. Maybe there's some sort of a bug with flag."
837920,849520," Uh. Ha. It's stuck. Yeah. Okay. Maybe there's some sort of a bug. So, they basically like disabled or"
849520,856880," something. Um. So, probably one of the things we can do is just convert all of this thing to OGG."
857840,864560," I hope Null will forgive us for that. Because I'm not really an expert on formats. As far as I know,"
864560,871440," flag is a lossless format. So, it probably has the best quality. If I convert flag to OGG,"
871440,880000," does it make it worse in terms of like a sound quality? Um. Right. Probably it does. I hope Null is"
880000,887200," going to forgive us for that. Let's actually quickly do that. Um. Let me. So, what was that?"
887200,893760," The tower of dreams. So, let's do convert. Uh. The tower of dreams. So, I think. I think we can use"
893760,904160," SFM pack. Uh. Right. So, this is the tower of dreams. And uh. Let's just do OGG. Right. So, is it going to work?"
906080,913680," Uh huh. Uh huh. So, it's doing something. So, it's actually. Yeah. It's 42 megabytes."
913680,917520," So, it's going to. It's going to take some time. All right."
917520,924640," Actually. Yeah. It's actually smaller. Which indicates that it's probably compressed. So,"
924640,930160," which is probably. It's uh. It means that. It's uh. It's uh. It's worse quality."
930160,939680," Okay. Uh. According to music nerds. It uh. It would flag is lossless. Uh. Wave OGG. Uh."
939680,945680," Ideal losing. Okay. So, that makes sense. But um. We can't load flag. Right. But maybe this is"
945680,951760," something that could be fixed like in the future releases or something like that. Uh. Yeah. 42 megabytes."
951760,957840," That means it's a very high quality. It's a. It's a very high quality. Like it has a lot of samples."
957840,964400," Uh. So, yeah. So, that's the sign of quality. Uh. We've got some subs. Uh. Thank you so much"
964400,970320," everyone who uh. Who subscribed. Thank you so much. I love WC. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello."
970320,974960," Hello. Lemtopia. Thank you so much for Twitch Prime. And Featalyzer. Thank you so much for tier one. Very"
974960,980160," epic zozy stream. Thank you for gifting all the money to Jeffrey Bezos. I don't get any of that."
980160,991120," But I really appreciate the the gesture nonetheless. Uh. All right. So, let's try to uh. Run this"
991120,999520," entire thing. So, I need to update flag to OGG. All right. So, this is a flag to OGG. And uh. Let's build one"
999520,1008160," more time. And. Musializer. Okay. So, it's taking some time. Oh. File loaded successfully. That's very"
1008160,1014640," interesting. It's it's kind of interesting how much time it actually took to load it up. So, it's probably"
1014640,1030800," processing it or something. Okay. So, uh. Let's go ahead and uh. Do that. Uh. Let's try to play uh. The"
1030800,1041280," the thing. Include ray beep uh. Play sound. So, as far as I know, it's as simple as just this."
1041280,1049760," Right. You just play the sound. But I'm not sure if it's going to work without any uh event loop."
1049760,1057040," Right. Because after you said play, is it going to block? But if it blocks, how does it work out in case"
1057040,1062480," of a game? Right. Because in a game, you have event loop and stuff like that. So, you you can't block."
1062480,1066240," So, but if it doesn't block, we're going to exit immediately. So, it's not going to play. So,"
1066240,1071840," there should be some sort of event loop. I suppose. Uh. Right. In any case, uh. Let's actually try to"
1071840,1077040," rebuild this entire thing. And I'm going to pause the music from here. Right. Because we're going to be,"
1077040,1082720," we want to be able to listen whether we manage to load the sound or not. Um. Right. So,"
1082720,1092240," let's do mutualizer. And it's loading things up. Um. And it didn't play anything. It literally didn't"
1092240,1100160," play anything. Great job. So, I wonder if we can do sleep one second. Will it play something?"
1107120,1114560," I don't think it played anything. The sound of silence. Yeah. I'm sorry. Um. So, we can try to"
1114560,1123680," maybe organize some sort of event loop. Um. Hmm. Wait a second. I didn't rebuild it with sleep."
1123680,1127200," Okay. So, I should actually rebuild the end run simultaneously."
1127200,1140000," That's cool. So, which is funny because sleep blocks the current thread."
1140000,1145840," Sleep blocks the current thread, which means there's a separate audio thread."
1153680,1158320," So, there is a separate audio thread."
1158320,1168880," But yeah. So, essentially you need to sleep for the duration of the entire song. And how can we know the"
1168880,1175760," duration of the entire song? That's a very interesting question. Uh. Can we, can we get some stuff? Uh, probably."
1176880,1183680," Uh. So, there is a music. Um. So, maybe we have to actually handle this kind of stuff with music."
1183680,1193520," Uh. Wave sound. What's the difference between wave and music management? That's pretty interesting."
1193520,1202240," That's really interesting. So, I would like to maybe try to explore that. So, let's try to explore that a"
1202240,1209440," little bit. So, I'm gonna go into the source code of the Raylip. Uh. And maybe, maybe we can take a look"
1209440,1215200," at some of the examples, right? So, let's actually take a look. Uh. So, I suppose maybe my hypothesis."
1215200,1224160," Uh. My hypothesis is that sound is for like short sound effects. When you like jump or uh, you know,"
1224160,1229840," shoot. Because it's, it's a game library, right? And music for sort of like a long background music."
1230480,1236640," Or something like that. And maybe because of that, these are different entities?"
1236640,1242560," That's actually makes sense. Like, you notice how much time it takes to load a sound?"
1242560,1250400," What if the music actually doesn't load the entire music into the memory, but sort of streams it from the"
1250400,1257200," file? Uh. Right. So, and that's why there's such a huge difference, right? Because sounds usually short and"
1257200,1264080," small. So, it loads everything, uh, everything up. But music is just like it streams it from the file."
1264080,1268640," Um. So, let's actually give it a try. I'm, I'm, I'm really curious. Uh. What if I just replace"
1268640,1277760," sound with music? Right? So, in Raylip, uh. So, and the music even loaded with music stream. Okay. So,"
1277760,1285360," that's one is interesting. Uh. Music stream. Uh. So, let's use the music. Uh. This one is the music."
1285360,1291520," Let's not try to load anything or, I mean, to play anything. Just like see. It's actually instantaneous."
1291520,1300640," Look how fast it is. Uh. So, this has to be something like this. Yeah. And if I replace it with sound."
1301280,1310000," Uh. Sound. Maybe I'm gonna just like comment it out like so. So, this is gonna be sound. Sound."
1310000,1320800," Music. Sound. It. Look how much time it takes. To load up. So, that's probably the difference."
1320800,1324160," Right. And for long lasting things, you want to probably use music."
1326000,1331920," Okay. That's cool. So, uh. I'll, I'll note that. Uh. I'll note that. And how do I play this thing?"
1331920,1338400," Play music stream. Uh. All right. So, it's probably something like this."
1338400,1348800," Uh. But we probably have to also do sleep. Um. All right. So, uh. Let's actually"
1350240,1361440," pause. And let's just run it. And it didn't do scheiße. Didn't do scheiße. Didn't play shit."
1361440,1374080," Wait a second. If it doesn't load everything from the file system, maybe we have to sort of pull it"
1374080,1381280," somehow. Um. Let me try to find some examples in the Rayleaf itself. Let me try to find some examples."
1381280,1387600," It's actually rather interesting. So, if I do grab play music stream. So, there are some examples."
1387600,1392240," Okay. So, this is like literally how you use music. Okay. Uh. Oh."
1392240,1401600," Yeah. You essentially need to have an event loop. And you need to pull the music in the event loop."
1401600,1405280," Because it's not, um, completely loaded into the, in the memory."
1405280,1411040," That's why it just loads up so freaking quickly. Right. Because it's just like open the file. But"
1411040,1415680," it doesn't read anything in sort of pull. But by the way, I'm pulling all of that, uh, out of my ass."
1415680,1419920," Right. I don't really know how exactly this entire system works. But this is sort of like"
1419920,1426480," the explanation my brain hallucinated for this kind of API. Um. Right. So, I don't know."
1427760,1435920," Um. So, maybe music is mainstream. Three is main thread. Uh. Maybe. Maybe this. Uh. I don't really"
1435920,1444080," know. Um. Okay. So, let's actually, you know, organize. Uh. Let's actually organize the event loop."
1444080,1449680," And maybe even open the file. Open a window, rather. Right. So, I think, I think it would make sense to"
1449680,1458000," actually open the window. Um. So, init window. Let's do something like this. Mutualizer."
1458000,1465600," So, this is a mutualizer. And it's also set target FPS to 60. There we go. Uh. After that,"
1467280,1474720," we need to organize the event loop. While window should close. Actually, while it should not close."
1474720,1481920," We have to update music stream. So, we're going to be updating the music stream. And then, we're going"
1481920,1488880," to begin drawing. So, this is, by the way, very important in Raylib applications. Because the events"
1488880,1495760," are polled. The input events, the user events are polled in the begin drawing. So, if you don't do that,"
1495760,1501760," it starts to actually lag a lot. So, we experience that on some of the streams with Raylib. So, let's do"
1501760,1506960," clear background. And let's actually put something very bright. So, we can see that this is that everything"
1506960,1517280," is working. And let's um. Maybe give it a try. So, let's give it a try. Where is the thingy. Okay. So."
1517280,1523760," And it starts to play things instantaneously."
1525760,1528880," It's actually very cool."
1528880,1540000," So, we just created an audio player. Right. If you always wanted to create your replacement for"
1540000,1543120," VLC, this is how you do that with Raylib."
1547200,1554000," So, essentially, how many lines of code do you need? This is how many lines of code you need. You only need 23"
1554000,1562720," lines of code to replace your favorite music player. But to be fair, who uses local native music players"
1562720,1576560," in 2023, in the age of YouTube? SoundCloud, Spotify. Who uses all of that shit? Nobody uses that."
1576560,1583360," Oh, some people use that already. But it's a Twitch chat. So, that means they're lying. I don't believe them."
1584080,1594960," But maybe a lot of people actually use that stuff in here. Because"
1594960,1603120," yeah, this is like a Linux low-level c-stream. Of course, everyone basically rips off the YouTube and"
1603120,1607840," listen locally without all of this tracking and stuff like that. Well, yeah, of course."
1607840,1612560," So, yeah. Because that's kind of the people we have in here. So, that makes sense."
1612560,1622480," All right. So, but the question is: we have a window on which we can draw Scheisse."
1622480,1632240," And we can play the sound. Can we have an access to, like, the currently played wave?"
1633600,1638720," Right. The currently played wave. Is that something that we can do? That would have been kind of"
1638720,1645040," interesting. Because I know, like, in SDL there is a very cool thing. There is a very cool thing where"
1645040,1653600," you can set up a callback for what's currently played. You can set up a callback and essentially"
1653600,1659360," in that callback you're getting the buffer and you can do some stuff with it. You can maybe apply some"
1659360,1666880," effects on that buffer or you can render that buffer somewhere. So, and if we manage to get,"
1666880,1673200," like, chunks of the wave of the sound, we'll be able to do that, this kind of visualizations."
1673200,1683840," Okay. In high school, they banned us from YouTube in the computer lab. So, I wrote my own audio player"
1683840,1690560," out of spite and listened to music on my flash drive. My teacher defended me to the principal because I"
1690560,1698560," made it and it was a coding class kick. That's a good... You got a good teacher. My God. That's a very"
1698560,1703040," good teacher. Like, they understand. They actually understand that this is impressive because some of"
1703040,1709040," the teachers may not even, like, comprehend that what she did is actually impressive. And you deserve"
1709040,1714480," credit for that. So, and that's the most soul-crushing thing, in my opinion, because I've had a lot of"
1714480,1720000," a lot of teachers like that. So, you are extremely lucky. So, it's actually pretty cool."
1720000,1725280," Base teacher, yeah."
1725280,1733840," Because I really, like, had a lot of teachers, especially in uni, where I would code something"
1733840,1738800," fucking impressive, like, in Haskell. And they would be completely oblivious to that,"
1738800,1743520," because they couldn't even comprehend what I just did. And there would be something like,"
1743520,1748720," ""Don't waste my time with this bullshit. Like, go away."" It's just like... Like, you spend so much time"
1748720,1754640," and, like, pour so much soul into this thing, and they can't even understand what the fuck you just did."
1755520,1763200," They just just count. Right? Maybe they can, but they don't care, or something. It's just like... Anyway."
1763200,1770000," Truly Sadgy. Truly, truly Sadgy."
1770000,1773840," Absolutely Sadgy."
1773840,1783520," Okay. So, let me see. So, let's take a look at the API and stuff like that. What can we have in here?"
1785360,1792160," So, resume music... We can actually pause and resume the music. That's pretty cool."
1792160,1802720," Can we do some stuff like... If is key pressed key... Let's say space."
1802720,1810080," So, can we toggle this stuff? We can't do it. Oh, you can only pause and resume."
1811120,1815920," But how do I know if something plain... Oh, okay. So, you have is music stream playing."
1815920,1823280," So, essentially, if is music stream playing... So, this is music."
1823280,1827120," Right. So, if the music stream playing..."
1829440,1835760," We just pause the music stream... The music stream music."
1835760,1841440," And otherwise... Resume..."
1841440,1846080," Music stream. Okay. So, that should actually kind of work."
1846080,1849520," Let's pause this stuff."
1851680,1869280," Anyway. Is it not ""pogers""? Is it not ""pogers""? I think it's pretty ""pogers""."
1869280,1872160," Okay. So, what do we have..."
1874000,1876720," So, we can do this kind of stuff. But the question is..."
1876720,1880800," How can we get the chunks?"
1880800,1882800," So, we can update audio..."
1882800,1885600," Uh... I can't see Scheisse. I can't see Scheisse."
1885600,1889760," Set audio stream callback."
1889760,1894480," Huh. This one is interesting."
1894480,1902800," Okay. So, it's a little bit too loud for me."
1903680,1904560," I wonder if I can..."
1904560,1907200," I wonder if I can control the volume."
1907200,1909440," Is there something like ""volume""?"
1909440,1912000," There's literally ""volume""."
1912000,1913440," Can I make it like half of that?"
1913440,1916720," Because I think it's too loud on my side."
1916720,1918720," I can control it for you in OBS."
1918720,1921440," But for me, it's just like too loud in my headphones."
1921440,1922720," Can I make like half of it?"
1922720,1924880," Right. So, because it..."
1924880,1927600," Does it accept things from 0 to 1?"
1927600,1929360," Yeah, it should be accepting from 0 to 1."
1929360,1930400," So, let's give it a try."
1930400,1933200," That's much better, in my opinion."
1934640,1935680," Yeah, that's much better."
1935680,1939440," So, we can even maybe create some sort of like a UI control."
1939440,1943200," Where we can control the sounds and stuff like that."
1943200,1945280," So, it's actually very easy to do so."
1945280,1947280," Yeah."
1947280,1952400," And while it's playing, I can do some stuff, actually."
1952400,1957520," Okay. So, you can set the callback, apparently."
1957520,1960800," So, let me see."
1960800,1962240," Let me take a look at some of the examples."
1962240,1964320," How are you supposed to use this entire thing?"
1964320,1968960," So, this is examples and grep."
1968960,1972240," Oh, shit."
1972240,1973920," Okay."
1973920,1975520," That killed something."
1975520,1977440," RowStream."
1977440,1979040," RowStream."
1982000,1982960," So, audio input callback."
1982960,1983920," Audio input callback."
1983920,1987120," Huh."
1987120,1994640," Oh, this is for generating the sound?"
1994640,1995840," Yeah, okay."
1995840,1996240," I see."
1996240,2000640," So, this is not for getting what is currently playing."
2000640,2001840," It's for generating."
2001840,2002960," Right?"
2002960,2010800," Because essentially, you accept the buffer and then we pawn it into this kind of thing and then we just generate some sort of a sound."
2011360,2014240," So, it's for generating the sounds, which is actually kind of cool."
2014240,2018640," So, that means we will be able to maybe implement synthesizer in the future."
2018640,2020080," That would have been actually kind of cool."
2020080,2022080," Implementing the synthesizer."
2022640,2024800," So, we got some subs."
2024800,2025680," Thank you so much."
2025680,2026880," Ileonte."
2026880,2027200," Thank you."
2027200,2027440," Thank you."
2027440,2027680," Thank you."
2027680,2027680," Thank you."
2027680,2029120," With the message SodinPog."
2029120,2030080," SodinPog."
2030080,2030800," Indeed."
2030800,2031200," Thank you."
2031200,2031520," Thank you."
2031520,2031760," Thank you."
2031760,2031840," Thank you."
2031840,2033840," All right."
2035200,2036640," So, that's pretty poggers."
2036640,2045360," So, what's interesting is that so audio callback, it accepts the buffer and frames."
2045360,2047040," So, that's the only thing it accepts."
2047040,2050000," And the buffer, I suppose, are the samples, right?"
2050000,2052640," Or maybe frames."
2052640,2056000," I don't really know what is a frames, but anyway."
2056000,2058320," So, there's also..."
2058320,2066080," So, the thing is, audio callback is used for something that is called string processor."
2066080,2069120," Attach audio stream processor to the string."
2069120,2072480," And what is an audio stream processor?"
2072480,2074640," So, it accepts the same callback."
2074640,2077840," Maybe that's what we can use for rendering this thing."
2077840,2079120," Maybe that's what we can use."
2079120,2081760," You know what I mean?"
2081760,2084400," That could be the winner."
2084400,2086240," That could be the winner."
2086240,2088080," All right."
2088080,2090960," So, let me see."
2090960,2095680," So, this is going to be software, arraylib, examples."
2095680,2097360," And let me actually find..."
2097360,2099120," All right."
2099120,2099520," All right."
2099520,2101200," So, okay."
2101200,2104720," So, you can apply some effects like delay, LPF."
2104720,2106720," I don't really know what is the LPF, but okay."
2106720,2115120," So, you literally attach a callback to the stream, to the music stream."
2115120,2116000," And what is this thing?"
2116000,2116960," Okay."
2116960,2119120," So, it's probably defined somewhere here."
2119120,2120640," So, audio effects."
2120640,2125280," So, you take the buffer and you essentially modify the buffer, I see."
2125280,2125680," Let's see."
2125680,2127280," Okay."
2127280,2128720," So, that's very interesting."
2128720,2130320," So, you literally modify the buffer."
2130320,2134400," But in our case, I don't think we need to modify the buffer."
2134400,2136080," Oh, low-pass filter."
2136080,2136400," Yeah, yeah."
2136400,2136960," Thank you so much."
2136960,2138400," Like, I see, I see, I see."
2138400,2140800," Only bass goes through."
2140800,2141360," I see, I see."
2141360,2146400," I just didn't know how this thing is translated, because I'm not really an audio person."
2146960,2147920," Right."
2147920,2150320," So, I didn't instantly recognize what it is."
2150320,2154640," All right."
2154640,2158320," So, you can basically attach some sort of a callback."
2158320,2165920," And I suppose you will be receiving the frames or the chunks that are supposed to be played or something."
2165920,2168080," You can modify them, but you don't have to."
2168800,2172160," We can try to render them and see how it goes."
2174080,2179520," To be fair, is there any way in Ray Leap to get, like, how much we already played?"
2179520,2182080," So..."
2182080,2184800," Okay, I see."
2184800,2186560," So, get music time played."
2187440,2188720," And it returns in seconds."
2188720,2191840," Which is rather interesting."
2191840,2197920," Because we can essentially just pre-load the entire wave."
2197920,2199520," Right."
2199520,2203200," We can pre-load the entire wave and pre-process it."
2203200,2208480," And then, basically, as the music is playing, we can get the time."
2208480,2212320," And by the time, we know in our pre-process data where this stuff is located."
2212320,2214320," So, yeah."
2214320,2215680," We can do this kind of stuff."
2215680,2216400," It's kind of interesting."
2216400,2220800," But maybe it would be easier to do that through the stream processor and whatnot."
2220800,2224240," So, let me give it a try."
2224240,2228000," So, I want to try the pre-processer."
2228000,2230480," So, attach."
2230480,2232240," So, this has to be a stream."
2232240,2234880," And I think stream is part of the music."
2234880,2237040," Yeah, it's part of the music."
2237040,2241200," So, you attach a processor to the music stream like so."
2241200,2243840," So, then you have an audio callback."
2243840,2247520," And the audio callback is something like this."
2247520,2249280," Right."
2249280,2250800," So, let's actually call it a callback."
2250800,2256000," I suppose it doesn't return anything but accepts the data."
2256000,2259680," We're not going to be just using any data in here."
2259680,2261680," We're going to be doing frames."
2261680,2266400," Though, it probably would make sense to just print the frames."
2266400,2269280," I suppose frames are the samples."
2269280,2271360," They're essentially the samples."
2273600,2273920," Right."
2273920,2275120," So, let's do callback."
2275120,2280800," Callback frames equal to u."
2280800,2282800," And we just do frames."
2282800,2289280," And so, let's just simply attach callback."
2290560,2292000," So, we're attaching the callback."
2292000,2293120," And that should be it."
2293120,2297280," Let me try to simply build the entire thing."
2297280,2298320," Okay."
2298320,2299360," So, it seems to be building."
2299360,2301120," All right."
2301120,2306240," So, I want to try it now to run this entire thing."
2306240,2309280," Okay."
2310880,2317600," Yo, that's a very low amount of frames, chat."
2317600,2320480," That's an extremely low amount of frames."
2320480,2325600," So, to render the equalizer and stuff like that."
2325600,2328720," I was thinking that maybe we're going to be using FFT."
2329760,2333600," But since this is such a low amount of frames, maybe we can just use DFT then."
2333600,2334720," Right."
2334720,2337920," Without, you know, a fast part."
2337920,2344720," Because DFT is just like a less performant algorithm than FFT."
2344720,2346640," It's more like a general algorithm."
2346640,2347200," Right."
2347200,2350560," So, in a naive DFT algorithm is usually n squared."
2350560,2351200," Right."
2351200,2354560," But FFT is n log n."
2354560,2354800," Right."
2354800,2356560," And implementing FFT."
2356560,2358320," I don't know."
2358320,2364000," I can't really implement FFT by heart because I don't fully understand it."
2364000,2373280," So, it uses the property of, basically, of periodic complex numbers or something like that."
2373280,2376560," It uses mathematical properties that I do not fully understand."
2376560,2380720," But DFT, I think I can implement it by heart."
2380720,2382400," Like, I do understand it."
2382400,2384640," Especially after watching the Veritasium video."
2384640,2388160," Like, have you guys watched the Veritasium video on FFT?"
2388640,2390080," It's actually a very cool video."
2390080,2394000," Like, I really recommend you to watch it to understand what FFTs are, like, all about."
2394000,2396800," Or, like, generally Fourier transforms."
2396800,2397840," Yeah."
2397840,2401600," So, remember, a remarkable story behind the most important algorithm of all time."
2401600,2406320," So, I really recommend to watch this video if you're interested in Fourier transforms."
2408000,2408880," All right."
2408880,2409120," All right."
2409120,2409120," All right."
2409120,2412960," So, let me see."
2412960,2413600," Let me see."
2413600,2415920," So, this is the description."
2415920,2422880," The Veritasium video on FFT."
2425600,2425920," Okay."
2425920,2432800," So, let me, let me think, let me think."
2432800,2438720," So, and since we have such a small amount of frames, we can actually do squares."
2438720,2442640," So, it's around, like, 588 or something like that."
2442640,2447680," So, and if you take a square of that, 588, it's still too much."
2447680,2454560," For, like, each frame, each single frame, it's kind of, it's kind of too much."
2454560,2456800," So, it would be better to use FFT anyway."
2456800,2461280," But keep in mind that I still can't, like, understand FFT by heart."
2461280,2464960," So, we're probably going to be just, like, stealing that algorithm from somewhere."
2464960,2468640," But I can try to explain whatever I understand about FFTs."
2468640,2470560," So, I understand a little bit."
2470560,2471520," I understand a little bit."
2471520,2475040," Something I think I will be able to explain."
2475040,2476400," Okay."
2476400,2484320," So, let me, let me try to find, I can try to think."
2484320,2490000," So, what we want to do, we want to actually render this buffer data."
2490000,2490240," Right."
2490240,2491760," We want to render this buffer data."
2491760,2495840," But the question is, like, what is the frames?"
2495840,2498800," And how is that different from samples?"
2498800,2506960," So, one of the things I want to do, I want to get the information about the format of this,"
2506960,2509600," of this file."
2509600,2509840," Right."
2509840,2511840," So, what's the size of the sample?"
2511840,2514000," How many channels does it have?"
2514000,2515120," And so on and so forth."
2515120,2516800," Right."
2516800,2518240," So, I want to do this kind of stuff."
2519120,2521520," So, let me go to RayLib."
2521520,2524240," And let me find the music."
2524240,2529200," So, we do have frame count, total number of frames, considering channels."
2529200,2535680," So, what's the difference between samples and frames in music?"
2535680,2537360," Does anybody know?"
2537360,2542320," Sound samples versus frames."
2542320,2543600," I'm going to Google, of course."
2543600,2548320," Difference between frames and samples in waveform."
2548320,2548560," Yeah."
2548560,2553360," Like, frames, samples."
2553360,2557120," A sample is the smallest usable quantum of digital audio."
2557120,2561280," The term ""frame"" isn't formally defined in pure audio terms."
2561280,2562240," In pure audio terms."
2562240,2566480," But it's often used in relation to video that may accompany the audio track."
2566480,2567680," But we don't have any video."
2567680,2570640," I have a feeling that..."
2570640,2572560," Okay."
2572560,2576000," So, my intuition, which might be wrong, actually, is that..."
2576000,2580320," So, if you have two channels, you have pairs of samples."
2580320,2584160," And maybe ""frame"" is basically a pair of samples."
2584160,2584400," Right."
2584400,2585120," Includes channels."
2585120,2586960," And this is basically what they say in here."
2586960,2589360," In the comments."
2589360,2591120," But I want some sort of a confirmation."
2591120,2591680," Like, right."
2591680,2592400," So, it's just like..."
2592400,2596000," Difference between audio sample and frame."
2596000,2596960," A sample is a value."
2596960,2597920," Is a set of values."
2597920,2600080," Multi-channel is a value."
2600080,2601360," Or a set of values."
2601360,2603680," Or single frame vector."
2603680,2605200," This is bad."
2605200,2614800," I'm going to just assume that ""frame"" is just like a pairs of samples."
2614800,2616000," If you have two channels, right?"
2616000,2618720," So, it's just like a group of samples."
2618720,2620560," But that's what it is."
2620560,2620960," I don't know."
2620960,2622000," It's just like kind of weird."
2622000,2624560," So, we can have a amount of frames."
2624560,2626880," So, let's actually print this information."
2626880,2633440," Let's do something like ""music frame count""."
2633440,2636960," And ""frame"" is actually unsigned thinking."
2636960,2641280," ""music frame count""."
2641280,2648960," And maybe the rest of the stuff we can find in audio stream."
2648960,2650480," Okay, so we have a sample rate."
2650480,2652400," Samples per second."
2652400,2656960," But then..."
2656960,2662400," Does it include the channels or..."
2662400,2663040," Oh my god."
2663040,2664480," This is so confusing!"
2664480,2675360," That means I have to divide it by two and that's going to be frames per second."
2675360,2676160," And that's going to be frames per second."
2676160,2677680," Is that what it's going to be?"
2681920,2683120," What the fuck?"
2683120,2683920," Why does it have to be..."
2683920,2688160," Why there's no consistent terminology?"
2688160,2692240," That's so bad!"
2692240,2692400," Like..."
2692400,2693520," Okay."
2693520,2694720," I need to calm down."
2694720,2695600," I'm getting angry."
2696480,2697680," Let's programmers again."
2697680,2698720," Okay."
2698720,2698960," Okay."
2698960,2699360," Whatever."
2699360,2700480," So..."
2700480,2701840," It's just like..."
2701840,2702880," Come on."
2702880,2705680," Can you just agree on the terminology or something?"
2705680,2709680," It's just like it's not helpful."
2709680,2712080," All right."
2712080,2714000," So the music stream."
2714000,2715680," And..."
2715680,2718480," Maybe I can do something like this."
2718480,2720800," Print app."
2720800,2723600," And it's going to be you."
2723600,2725920," And let's just put it in here."
2725920,2729600," And I just want to see the stuff."
2729600,2732560," So let's remove the login for the callback."
2733520,2734240," All right."
2734240,2736400," So it didn't recompile anything."
2736400,2740560," So music, music, mutualizer."
2740560,2741360," All right."
2741360,2745120," So we've got 48,000 samples per second, which is like the classic."
2745120,2748080," Sample size 16 and amount of channels of two."
2748080,2748640," All right."
2748640,2754000," So I'm not sure if the original amount of channel was two, but maybe this is due to conversion."
2754000,2757120," Maybe the conversion did this thing."
2763520,2766640," So, okay."
2766640,2769200," If we accept..."
2769200,2774320," So sample size is 16 bits."
2774320,2777040," So that means a single frame has to be 32 bits."
2777040,2781440," And I wonder..."
2781440,2785360," Is it going to be float or what kind of..."
2785360,2788480," Is it integer or is it float?"
2791760,2794160," So that's a very interesting question."
2794160,2797760," So when we're loading..."
2797760,2803600," Our audio..."
2803600,2806000," Wait a second."
2806000,2808000," So there's audio raw thingy."
2808000,2810560," And they're using short."
2810560,2814480," But this is for raw audio."
2814480,2819520," So let me see how they create audio stream."
2820800,2822320," Sample 16 bit short."
2822320,2824640," Well, I mean, float..."
2824640,2825200," There could..."
2825200,2828080," There's no such thing as 16 float, at least for audio."
2828080,2832000," I mean, I know that this float 16, but it's usually used for AI and stuff like that."
2832000,2833120," Right."
2833120,2833920," So, but here..."
2833920,2836960," It's not really a thing."
2836960,2846000," So maybe since it's 16, I can safely just do this thing."
2849760,2851520," You in 16 T."
2851520,2852560," So this is the pointer."
2852560,2858560," All right."
2858560,2861120," And then you in 16 T."
2861120,2863040," Let's say frames."
2863040,2864080," So this is going to be frames."
2864080,2865280," And this is buffer data."
2865280,2867040," Since buffer data is a void star."
2867040,2868880," So we don't really even need that stuff."
2868880,2874880," For some reason, I'm really lagging when I'm..."
2874880,2877680," Yeah, Emacs is actually lagging when this..."
2877680,2879600," The ready thing is playing."
2879600,2880480," I don't really know why."
2880480,2882800," But it's just like, kind of weird."
2882800,2885360," It's a little bit weird."
2887760,2901360," And what we can do in here..."
2901360,2902400," So..."
2902400,2904480," So people say that they have to use in 16."
2904480,2907760," Maybe you're right, because it's a short."
2907760,2909200," Short is actually inside."
2909200,2910320," So it's actually inside."
2911680,2912800," All right."
2912800,2916160," So, but how are we going to be rendering this entire stuff?"
2916160,2919680," Because if you want to render the thing..."
2919680,2922160," If you want to render the things..."
2922160,2926240," You can only do that between begin drawing and end drawing."
2926240,2930240," And I actually doubt that callback is drawn..."
2930240,2934240," Is called between begin drawing and end drawing."
2934240,2936400," I actually doubt that."
2936400,2938240," So one of the things we probably have to do..."
2938240,2940720," We have to have maybe like a global frames..."
2940720,2942560," Of some sort."
2942560,2944480," Like a global variable."
2944480,2948320," So in a callback, we're going to be copying this thing in a global variable."
2948320,2952400," And then when we reach the rendering..."
2952400,2954240," When we reach the rendering stuff..."
2954240,2956720," We're going to basically take that global thing..."
2956720,2958080," And we're going to put it on the screen."
2958080,2959440," You know what I mean?"
2959440,2962640," This is probably what we need to do."
2962640,2964560," But the problem here is that the frames..."
2964560,2966960," They can have varying sizes."
2966960,2969600," They can have varying sizes."
2969600,2974240," So that means we have to like do a little bit of a memory management."
2974240,2974960," If you know what I mean?"
2974960,2978080," So yeah."
2978080,2979760," Let's actually introduce the following thing."
2979760,2981040," So this is going to be 16."
2982720,2984640," And this is like a huge problem."
2984640,2986480," Is it going to be called in a separate thread?"
2986480,2988960," If it's a sound..."
2988960,2990720," Like in there's..."
2990720,2993120," It's not really particularly that well documented."
2993120,2994480," So it could be actually kind of..."
2994480,2996640," Kind of dangerous to do this kind of thing."
2996640,2997520," But anyway."
2997520,2999440," So I'm going to do null."
2999440,3002240," And let's introduce something like capacity."
3002240,3002560," Right."
3002560,3003920," So this is going to be capacity."
3003920,3005360," How much we already allocated."
3005360,3007520," So essentially my idea is that I'm going to be allocating that..."
3008240,3013200," On a heap."
3013200,3016560," But another thing would be to just maybe pre-allocate..."
3016560,3019280," Limited amount of frames in here."
3019280,3020560," Right."
3020560,3022320," So limited amount of frames in here."
3022320,3026960," And basically if you have more just ignore the rest."
3026960,3028080," Yeah."
3028080,3029040," Simply ignore the rest."
3029040,3030480," That could be one of these things."
3030480,3031360," So..."
3031360,3033520," And I need to give this thing a name."
3034080,3037040," So I don't really know how to go with like a global frames."
3037040,3041200," And then we can have global frames count."
3041200,3043040," Global frames count."
3043040,3047360," So that's basically what we can have in here."
3047360,3053680," And that's very, very interesting."
3060320,3060640," Okay."
3060640,3063440," So yeah."
3063440,3065120," We just need to copy this entire thing."
3065120,3066560," Mem copy."
3066560,3070720," So the target is a global frame."
3070720,3073280," The source is buffer data."
3073280,3075840," And how much do we want to copy actually?"
3075840,3077280," So we have to copy frames."
3077280,3081600," But interestingly enough, frames is a pair of those things."
3082160,3083920," So that means we have to copy..."
3083920,3089280," Int 16 T."
3089280,3090240," Right."
3090240,3091200," Int 16 T."
3091200,3093760," But multiplied by 2."
3093760,3095520," Right."
3095520,3098320," So frames multiplied by 2."
3098320,3100800," So this is how many int 16."
3100800,3105760," So this is how many shorts we need to copy into this sort of like a global frames."
3105760,3109200," So that makes sense."
3109920,3110560," I think."
3110560,3115520," And then we can save the amount of frames that we got in here."
3115520,3117440," But that's kind of dangerous."
3117440,3117680," Right."
3117680,3118720," So that's kind of dangerous."
3118720,3126880," Because essentially this thing can be bigger than whatever capacity we have in there."
3126880,3129200," So let me introduce a macro."
3129200,3131360," Something like array length."
3131360,3133760," The classical macro that I use everywhere."
3133760,3138240," And just do size of axis divided size of axis zero."
3138240,3140480," So that gives me the size of this array."
3140480,3142000," And essentially I can say."
3142000,3151680," If frames is for whatever reason bigger than array length of global frames."
3151680,3157840," It's going to be reassigned to this entire thing."
3157840,3159520," I'm going to reassign like this."
3159520,3164240," So it's never going to copy more than whatever we supposed to have in here."
3164240,3169920," But that is also not particularly true."
3169920,3177360," So that means we have to actually divide it by 2."
3179200,3181680," Frames and samples are confusing."
3181680,3188000," And I wouldn't be surprised that in the sound related software."
3188000,3192400," There is an enormous amount of vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows."
3194320,3195920," Because this is confusing."
3195920,3198800," This is straight up confusing."
3198800,3202320," Like frames, samples, and it's all so inconsistent."
3202320,3205040," And it's so not like really well defined."
3205040,3206720," It's just..."
3206720,3207520," Is that a thing?"
3207520,3211680," Is that a thing that in the sound related software there is a lot of buffer overflows?"
3211680,3212880," Because of this kind of shit."
3212880,3215280," I can see that being a thing actually."
3215280,3218240," I literally can see that being a thing."
3218240,3219680," Because that's fucking confusing."
3219680,3225120," So this is not frames."
3225120,3228000," So that's one of the things we have to realize."
3228000,3230480," This is not frames."
3230480,3236240," Maybe to make it a little bit easier for myself."
3236240,3240480," I'm going to store frames as 32."
3240480,3242800," Because it's pairs like left and right."
3242800,3244640," On top of that."
3245440,3246080," I think."
3246080,3248080," I'm going to say."
3248080,3249280," Yeah."
3249280,3252240," I'm going to actually hard code certain things."
3252240,3253760," After we loaded the music."
3253760,3254960," I'm going to just assert."
3254960,3258240," We only work with the music of a sample size 16."
3258240,3259600," At least for now."
3259600,3262240," In the future maybe we're going to make it more flexible."
3262240,3262960," With the channel."
3262960,3265360," Equal to 2."
3265360,3268000," And sample rate."
3268000,3268400," I don't know."
3268400,3270560," I don't really care about the sample rate right now."
3270560,3272320," So I don't think it's that important."
3272320,3274240," Right."
3274240,3274560," So."
3274560,3276000," And since we had coded all of that."
3276000,3278080," This is a single sample."
3278080,3278320," Right."
3278320,3280960," So it sort of like denotes the slot."
3280960,3282560," Into which I'm actually."
3282560,3282880," You know."
3282880,3284000," Saving all this kind of stuff."
3284000,3285440," And in here."
3285440,3287040," We don't have to do 2."
3287040,3288240," This is going to be 32."
3288240,3290640," And I don't have to think about this kind of stuff."
3290640,3293360," So I know that the single frame is 32 bits."
3293360,3294880," And I just like work with that."
3294880,3295920," Right."
3295920,3298240," And this is the amount of frames I have in here."
3298240,3299920," And everyone is happy."
3299920,3302480," And this entire thing doesn't even have to be nulled."
3302480,3303840," Right."
3303840,3305200," I just like do it like that."
3305200,3305760," There we go."
3305760,3308080," So after that."
3308080,3309360," Let's actually make it black."
3309360,3311680," Or maybe I'm going to use a little bit of a clitoral."
3312640,3316240," And use my usual background in here."
3316240,3318240," Not black background."
3318240,3320320," But sort of like a grayish background."
3320320,3322400," Like so."
3322400,3324800," And the thing I need to implement in here."
3324800,3326720," I just need to render."
3328320,3328960," The frames."
3328960,3331280," I just need to render the frames."
3331280,3334240," Okay."
3334240,3336880," So how are we going to be rendering the frames?"
3336880,3342000," So essentially I can iterate through each individual frame."
3342000,3342960," Right."
3342960,3344160," So it's just basically."
3344160,3349280," Less global frames count."
3349280,3351360," I'm iterating through the frames."
3351360,3353680," I'm just iterating through the frames."
3354560,3356480," And we can maybe."
3356480,3358560," Render."
3358560,3361520," A rectangle."
3361520,3362720," Of that frame."
3362720,3364160," Rectangle."
3364160,3366320," So."
3366320,3369520," Essentially we're going to render it on the screen."
3369520,3370320," Right."
3370320,3371680," We're going to render it on the screen."
3371680,3375680," So that means we need to split the screen into."
3375680,3377680," So I probably need to."
3377680,3379120," Just draw with my paint."
3379120,3380080," What I mean."
3380080,3380400," Right."
3380400,3381840," I just need to draw with my paint."
3381840,3382400," What I mean."
3383520,3386080," What exactly do I want to render in here."
3386080,3388640," So you have the."
3388640,3390880," Window."
3390880,3391040," Right."
3391040,3391920," You have the window."
3391920,3398000," And we've got a bunch of frames from the previous callback."
3398000,3400640," We've got a bunch of frames."
3400640,3401680," So essentially we."
3401680,3403440," Divide the width."
3403440,3405520," Of the."
3405520,3406960," Window."
3406960,3408640," By that amount of samples."
3408640,3409200," And we're going to."
3409200,3411680," Strike a line through the middle."
3411680,3413360," And essentially for each sample."
3413360,3414560," If it's a positive sample."
3414560,3416320," We're going to draw a rectangle."
3416320,3417920," Above."
3417920,3418880," The."
3418880,3420720," The middle line."
3420720,3421520," And if it's negative."
3421520,3423840," We're going to draw the rectangle below."
3423840,3425920," And that sort of will create the wave."
3425920,3426160," Right."
3426160,3427840," So right now we are not trying to do."
3427840,3429440," FFT or anything like that."
3429440,3431120," We're just trying to render the wave."
3431120,3432640," That we've got from the file."
3432640,3434240," Right."
3434240,3437520," So because we need to."
3437520,3438000," Uh."
3438000,3439120," Just have something."
3439120,3440240," Something on the screen."
3440240,3440560," Right."
3440560,3440800," Right."
3440800,3441120," First."
3441120,3444160," So we're trying to get all the elements down."
3444160,3445200," Uh."
3445200,3446160," And then we'll see."
3446160,3447280," How we can."
3447280,3448480," Make it a little bit more interesting."
3448480,3450480," So we need to get the."
3450480,3450960," Width."
3450960,3451680," Of the screen."
3451680,3452880," So if I remember correctly."
3452880,3454080," It's get render width."
3454080,3456240," And let's divide this entire stuff."
3456240,3457280," By the global frames."
3457280,3458960," But both of these things are integers."
3458960,3460080," Uh."
3460080,3461600," Both of these things are integers."
3461600,3463920," So we probably need to convert them to floats."
3463920,3465120," Uh."
3465120,3467440," We need to convert them to floats."
3467440,3470240," So we have sub pixel precision."
3470240,3472480," Sub pixel precision."
3472480,3473680," So we're going to do float."
3473680,3474720," And that should be enough."
3474720,3477280," So that will automatically convert this thing into float as well."
3477280,3479680," And let's call this something."
3479680,3480160," I don't know."
3480160,3482080," Like a cell width."
3482080,3482320," Right."
3482320,3482880," So there we go."
3482880,3484320," So this is a cell width."
3484320,3486560," And we know precise width in here."
3486560,3487520," So here we have."
3487520,3488800," Uh."
3488800,3491280," Double channel."
3491280,3491520," Right."
3491520,3492800," So we have a double channel."
3492800,3495120," So."
3495120,3496640," What I think I'm going to be doing."
3496640,3498000," I'm going to be essentially."
3498000,3499920," Taking ith."
3499920,3501200," Frame."
3501200,3504320," I'm going to take a pointer to the ith frame."
3504320,3508560," And I'm going to pawn it to the pointer to int 16t."
3508560,3509360," Right."
3509360,3511600," And I'm going to just dereference it."
3511600,3514320," So essentially it's going to pick one of the channels."
3514320,3515520," Right."
3515520,3517440," Is the null play."
3517440,3517840," Yeah."
3517840,3518880," It's null actually."
3518880,3521920," So check out his socials and stuff like that."
3521920,3525120," So I've got permission to actually listen to his songs."
3525120,3527840," So I'm not violating any copyrights."
3527840,3528240," I hope."
3528240,3530320," Right."
3530320,3532320," So anyway."
3532320,3534800," And 16."
3534800,3536640," So let's get the sample."
3536640,3536880," Right."
3536880,3537920," So this is the sample."
3538400,3540880," And that's a very interesting question."
3540880,3542640," Lost income."
3542640,3550320," I mean he can just claim the the YouTube video and Twitch world if he wants to."
3560080,3560640," All right."
3560640,3560640," All right."
3560640,3562720," So."
3562720,3567360," Line 15 frames squared."
3567360,3571040," Oh."
3571040,3572080," Okay."
3572080,3572480," Thank you."
3572480,3574240," Thank you so much."
3574240,3575680," All right."
3577680,3579360," So we've got the sample."
3579360,3581360," And how are we going to render the syntax thing?"
3581360,3584240," I would like to maybe print the sample somehow."
3584240,3587680," Yeah."
3587680,3588000," You know."
3588720,3592400," I'm going to go ahead and just print the samples on the screen."
3592400,3595200," Because I want to be able to see like what they are."
3595200,3597040," All right."
3597040,3598240," So how they look like."
3598240,3601920," And after I print them I'm going to exit out of this entire application."
3601920,3603440," All right."
3603440,3609760," Though we may not necessarily even have anything there."
3609760,3611040," So that's the problem."
3611040,3616800," So I'm going to exit if global frames count is greater than zero."
3616800,3620720," So that means the callback was called at least once."
3620720,3621520," Right."
3621520,3622880," Because at the beginning it's zero."
3622880,3624080," So."
3624080,3626480," And that might be the true when we only start the application."
3626480,3626720," Okay."
3626720,3627920," So let's actually give it a try."
3627920,3631680," So you int requires std int."
3631680,3633920," Requires std int."
3633920,3636640," Mem copy requires a string."
3636640,3639360," Mem copy requires a string."
3639360,3642160," So what else do we have in here?"
3642160,3643520," So this is frames."
3643520,3645680," What else do we have in here?"
3645680,3648000," Assert wants assert in here."
3648000,3654000," So channel set probably."
3654000,3656400," Oh yeah."
3656400,3656720," Okay."
3656720,3657680," So that kind of work."
3657680,3663200," So let me put a new line in here."
3663200,3667200," Okay."
3667200,3669280," So there's implicit thing."
3669280,3671440," So maybe we need std loop."
3671440,3673200," All right."
3673200,3679680," So the first batch of things we've got is rather bizarre because it's all zeros."
3679680,3684640," Which I do not particularly understand."
3684640,3691600," I wonder if this is because at the beginning literally we have a little bit of a silence."
3693760,3696400," one way we can try to confirm that."
3696400,3700960," Maybe we don't do that."
3700960,3705360," And we'll just do the space in here."
3705360,3707920," And just like new line."
3710800,3713840," So let me now recompile the syntax."
3713840,3715600," Okay."
3715600,3716320," It recompiles."
3716320,3718960," And let me just try to run."
3718960,3721520," Okay."
3721520,3723920," That looks believable."
3723920,3724800," Believe it or not."
3727680,3728080," Right."
3728080,3730800," So these kind of samples they do look believable."
3730800,3731680," Some of them negative."
3731680,3732560," Some of them positive."
3732560,3734080," And stuff like that."
3734080,3735040," That's actually very cool."
3735040,3736320," All right."
3736320,3738080," So I think we got the samples."
3738080,3738320," Right."
3738320,3741040," So we can try to use them."
3741040,3742640," All right."
3742640,3745600," So I'm going to try to literally render them now."
3747280,3748160," The question is."
3748160,3752080," Do we have like an int, 16, min, and max?"
3752080,3753280," I think we do have it."
3753280,3754960," Right."
3754960,3757280," So I need to draw a rectangle."
3757280,3759360," RayLip."
3759360,3761520," Draw a rectangle."
3761520,3765840," That should be pretty straightforward."
3765840,3768400," According to my calculations."
3768400,3769920," We're going to be using red color."
3771040,3774320," Position is going to be starting from zero."
3774320,3777360," So I multiply by cell width."
3777360,3777760," Right."
3777760,3781120," So this is position of X."
3781120,3784480," But then we need to decide the position of Y."
3784480,3786640," With actually is super straightforward."
3786640,3787760," It's a cell width."
3787760,3788960," It's nothing particularly special."
3788960,3790960," Right."
3790960,3791280," Y."
3791280,3796720," It has to start from the middle of the screen."
3796720,3798640," So we take the height and divide it by 2."
3798640,3800080," So this is from the middle of the screen."
3801520,3805280," So if the thing is positive, the thing is positive."
3805280,3807200," It has to actually go up."
3807200,3809680," It has to actually go up."
3809680,3815920," So for now, I think I'm going to render only positive things."
3815920,3823360," No, this is so bizarre."
3823360,3826960," Is there any like easy way for me to do that?"
3831360,3831680," All right."
3831680,3836880," So drawing a rectangle is a little bit painful because it accepts position and size."
3836880,3838560," What if they..."
3838560,3840080," Can I use negative size?"
3840080,3845600," Or does it have to be positive size?"
3850640,3854880," So that's kind of a mystery for me."
3854880,3855680," Uh, right."
3855680,3856240," So whatever."
3856240,3860720," Maybe for now."
3860720,3864000," Yeah."
3864000,3866960," Because it's like mathematically not particularly convenient."
3868000,3869360," But we can try to do that."
3869360,3870960," So minus..."
3870960,3873360," What's going to be the height?"
3873360,3877120," It has to be height."
3877120,3878240," Half of the height again."
3878240,3889520," But multiplied by the proportion of the actual value of the sample and the minimum."
3889520,3892320," So we need to perform like several mappings, right?"
3892320,3893840," We need to perform several mappings."
3893840,3896640," So the value of the sample, right?"
3896640,3900000," Essentially."
3900000,3904560," You have the value of the single sample."
3904560,3907760," And you guys know what is a sample?"
3907760,3915680," So essentially, digitally, the sound is stored as a sequence of numbers."
3915680,3919200," And those numbers actually represent the sound wave, right?"
3919200,3920800," They actually represent the sound wave."
3920800,3926320," So you literally have value that if you plot them, they look like this."
3926320,3928480," Like they literally look like a sound wave."
3928480,3930560," Right."
3930560,3933760," And each of these values is called samples."
3933760,3938480," And this is what I'm trying to draw."
3938480,3944960," So, and essentially, according to our format, their maximum value is going to be"
3946640,3950160," int 16 max."
3950160,3951440," Right."
3951440,3953040," So this is the maximum value."
3953040,3958400," And their minimum is going to be int 16 min."
3958400,3966880," So what I want to do, I want to normalize these values, right?"
3966880,3968800," So I want to normalize these values."
3968800,3970320," So this is sample essentially."
3973920,3974960," Essentially, what does it mean?"
3974960,3980960," I want their values not to be from zero to maximum, but I want them to be from zero to"
3980960,3986480," one or from zero to minus one, depending on whether they're positive or negative."
3986480,3988000," Why that is useful?"
3988000,3994960," That is useful because then I'll be able to map it to the screen."
3994960,3998480," So here you have a screen and here you have the middle of the screen."
3998480,4005760," So since I mapped the sample from zero to maximum to zero to one, I can basically multiply it by half"
4005760,4008640," of the height and get position somewhere here."
4008640,4014640," So I can remap it from a range, from its original range to the range of the screen."
4014640,4015920," Right."
4015920,4020480," So, and that makes it super easy to actually render all that."
4020480,4022720," So we need some sort of a normalization."
4022720,4024320," So how can we normalize that?"
4024320,4028080," Well, if it's positive, we can just take the sample, right?"
4028080,4032000," Cast it to float."
4032000,4032240," Right."
4032240,4034560," So F32 or whatever, right?"
4034560,4040000," And divide by the maximum value and 16 max."
4040000,4041520," So that's how we can normalize it."
4041520,4046720," And we can just now multiply that value by some sort of a height that we want to map it to."
4048240,4048640," Right."
4048640,4051280," But I don't know what's going to be actually easier."
4051280,4062560," So there should be some sort of like a quick way to map all of that stuff."
4062560,4070400," So let me maybe factor out things like width of the screen, width of the screen and height of the screen."
4070400,4070800," Right."
4070800,4077760," So this can be width, get render width and edge, get render height."
4077760,4081520," So, and we're going to just do it like this."
4081520,4084160," This is the height."
4084160,4086560," Right."
4086560,4087520," Okay."
4087520,4088480," So we'll get the sample."
4090080,4100720," If the sample is positive, we can just do sample float divided by int 16 max."
4100720,4101760," But if it's negative,"
4101760,4105840," we have to divide it by..."
4105840,4111120," Maybe we can just keep it as max actually, because it's like nature will..."
4112160,4121200," even though int max negative is not particularly equal to int minimum."
4121200,4124320," I don't think it's that much of a problem."
4124320,4128240," It's just like all by one, but is it really that important?"
4128240,4131600," So I think just doing that should be enough."
4131600,4136480," If it will create any problems, we will fix them."
4136480,4139040," If it doesn't create any problems, we're not going to do anything."
4139040,4140000," So it doesn't really matter."
4140720,4145360," So what's important here is just to have some sort of like interpolator,"
4145360,4146480," some sort of interpolator."
4146480,4147840," Okay."
4147840,4149360," So that's pretty cool."
4149360,4150640," So we have width."
4150640,4154080," So this is the position and this is that."
4154080,4157680," So then we specify cell width."
4157680,4162560," And in here, this is basically the height that we want to have in here."
4162560,4163760," Right."
4163760,4166000," So, and now we need to..."
4166000,4170160," This works only for the positive samples, right?"
4170160,4172560," So this is sample greater than zero."
4172560,4176160," Otherwise we have to do something else."
4176160,4181760," And since we're already kind of distinguish between positive and negative samples,"
4181760,4184000," maybe it makes sense to just do that."
4184000,4186000," Anyway."
4186000,4187120," Right."
4187120,4188960," So that's going to be fine."
4189520,4191280," So in terms of x is going to be that."
4191280,4200640," So in terms of y, this time, by the way, it is going to be, yeah, it's going to be zero."
4200640,4203600," Which is going to be that."
4203600,4204240," But the height..."
4204240,4211600," Yeah, it would be actually better to keep it like this."
4211600,4215520," So since sample is negative, this thing is also negative."
4215520,4217200," We divide one by another."
4217200,4219040," It is going to become positive."
4219040,4223040," So that theoretically should just work out."
4223040,4224160," I think."
4224160,4225600," I think that is it."
4225600,4227760," I think this is literally it."
4227760,4231920," So let's try to compile this entire thing and see if it's working."
4232480,4238560," Alright, so let's actually pause the music that we've been playing in here."
4238560,4241520," And see if we manage to..."
4241520,4245760," That is very funny."
4245760,4249360," It's also printing something."
4249360,4251200," Yeah, so it's printing new line in here."
4251200,4252880," Okay."
4252880,4256800," That was really strange."
4256800,4257440," But anyway."
4257440,4260320," So this doesn't have to be easy."
4260320,4261920," It has to be half of the height."
4262480,4265520," Does it look like a sound wave?"
4265520,4275360," Maybe."
4275360,4282400," Kind of, yeah."
4282400,4284640," It kind of looks like a sound wave at the same time."
4289120,4291360," So, yeah."
4291360,4296720," Maybe we have to look at the bigger period of time."
4307040,4311600," So samples are interleaved, but it's two channels, right?"
4311600,4316800," I'm just taking one sample of another."
4316800,4320320," And stereo samples are next to each other."
4320320,4322480," And this is why I'm taking one of the channels."
4325760,4327680," So this is why I'm taking one of the channels."
4327680,4330640," And as far as I know, the original thing was mono anyway."
4330640,4333920," So the channels are duplicated basically."
4333920,4337680," The channels are basically duplicated anyway."
4343840,4345840," So maybe it's just like too much."
4345840,4355200," Maybe it would make sense to, you know, basically append more."
4355200,4361920," Basically append more."
4361920,4366560," But shouldn't you then increment by two?"
4366560,4372400," I specifically changed frames to 32 bits so I don't have to increment by two."
4372400,4373840," I specifically said that."
4373840,4376560," Specifically said that."
4376560,4378880," All right."
4378880,4382240," So what I'm doing is that I'm storing the frames."
4382240,4385120," Right, I'm copying the frames in here."
4386800,4388800," And then I'm iterating the frames."
4388800,4389920," I'm just iterating the frames."
4389920,4392160," But I'm only taking one channel of the frame."
4392160,4395440," I'm taking only one channel of the frame."
4395440,4396960," I know that they're interleaved."
4396960,4398640," My code takes that into account."
4398640,4403120," Right, so my code literally takes that into account."
4403120,4410800," So this could be because it's a very short period of time."
4410800,4412320," Right, so it's too short."
4412320,4414800," It's really difficult to see anything useful there."
4415600,4416960," How can we make it bigger?"
4416960,4418960," So we can introduce..."
4418960,4423920," Yeah, maybe half of the..."
4423920,4424480," What would be..."
4424480,4428240," For example, 100 milliseconds."
4428240,4431120," We know that we have this amount of samples per second."
4431120,4432400," 48,000."
4432400,4434400," Right, we can take 100."
4434400,4438800," And this is basically 100 milliseconds."
4438800,4440960," Right, so this is 100 milliseconds."
4440960,4443120," So we can just do something like this."
4443120,4448560," And we can basically keep accumulating the frames."
4448560,4450320," We can keep accumulating the frames."
4450320,4460000," Interestingly enough, one of the things we can do is basically shift the frames."
4460000,4463360," That's a very interesting idea."
4464560,4469040," Yeah, so essentially, as soon as the chunk comes in..."
4469040,4470960," Right, so I can even draw what I want."
4470960,4477840," So we have some sort of a buffer."
4477840,4481840," And it's initially empty."
4481840,4485600," And you just keep track of this thing in here."
4485600,4487600," You just keep track of this thing in here."
4487600,4488560," You get some..."
4488560,4490000," A little bit of a data."
4490000,4492640," You just append this data in here."
4492640,4494720," And you increment this pointer in here."
4494720,4498640," And you do that several times until we fill up the whole buffer."
4500000,4501760," And then, as you get more data..."
4501760,4508160," Right, so you basically shift this entire thing to here."
4508160,4510560," And append that data at the beginning."
4510560,4512160," Right, so sort of a ring buffer."
4512160,4513920," Yes, sort of like a ring buffer."
4513920,4519040," And we can just maintain this thing."
4521520,4522960," We've got some gifted subs."
4522960,4528000," Thank you so much, map9n, for two gifted subs."
4528000,4528880," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
4528880,4530160," I really appreciate it."
4530160,4530880," It's very cool."
4530880,4533760," All righty, all righty, all righty."
4533760,4535840," So how are we going to be doing all of that?"
4535840,4538720," So we need to keep track of the capacity and stuff like this."
4538720,4544720," So I feel like there's too many"
4547120,4549840," coordinate cases for this thing."
4549840,4557600," How can we handle all of them?"
4557600,4559680," So the first coordinate case is when"
4559680,4566240," arraylen global frames."
4566240,4569440," So this is basically the capacity of the array."
4569440,4574320," Plus actually minus global frame count."
4574320,4576720," If we take the capacity and we subtract"
4576720,4577280," this thing."
4577280,4578960," Right."
4578960,4583280," And if this thing is bigger than the amount of frames"
4583280,4584800," we're trying to put in there."
4584800,4588240," So that means this amount of frames will just simply fit in there."
4588240,4591520," And we can just simply append that thing there."
4591520,4591760," Right."
4591760,4593040," So we just need to append there."
4593040,4596880," So it means we're going to be copying this thing at the end."
4596880,4598880," So by the way, this is sort of old code."
4598880,4599920," Let me outline it."
4599920,4604080," So global frames plus this thing."
4605280,4605600," Right."
4605600,4607680," We're copying these frames."
4607680,4612480," And then we just add global frames to here."
4612480,4615120," And we can return out of that."
4615120,4616000," Maybe not return."
4616000,4619200," Let's just check the next condition."
4619760,4628880," So the next condition is going to be is when it's not, when it's actually equal."
4628880,4637360," So when it's equal, maybe when it's equal, it's also fine."
4637360,4637680," Right."
4637680,4644000," I want to kind of put it the other way around because it's easier for my brain to think about"
4644000,4645120," that stuff stuff."
4645120,4645920," Right."
4645920,4648080," So this is the remaining amount of space."
4648080,4652480," We can feed that chunk into that remaining amount of space."
4653280,4655760," We're copying in there and we just like append it like that."
4655760,4664480," So the next situation, frames overflow."
4664480,4673920," But what if the frames that we try to push in there are actually bigger than the capacity?"
4673920,4682400," So I think the rest of the stuff is going to be frames being less or equal than the capacity at all."
4682400,4685520," Right, than the capacity at all."
4687760,4693360," And this one is when you're trying to push even bigger whatever you have than in here."
4693360,4694320," Right."
4694320,4695680," I think that that makes sense."
4695680,4698160," Okay."
4698160,4701040," So the first thing you need to do, you need to mem move."
4701040,4704320," You need to like upset a little bit of the stuff."
4712080,4713280," Yeah, I have to do that."
4713280,4714560," I think so much."
4714560,4714960," Whatever."
4714960,4718320," It's not going to change anything much."
4718320,4725920," So the destination and SRC."
4725920,4726960," Okay."
4726960,4732720," So the destination is going to be global frames."
4732720,4733040," Right."
4733040,4737520," So we're copying from here to here."
4737520,4740480," So that means the destination is the beginning of the buffer."
4740480,4742240," The destination at the beginning of the buffer."
4742240,4746080," But what's the source?"
4746080,4749120," So we need to push this kind of thing in here."
4749120,4752320," So it's basically the size of the frames."
4752320,4754400," Yeah, that actually makes sense."
4754400,4765200," So source is going to be global frames plus size you insert it to T."
4765200,4766320," Multiply the frames."
4766320,4769040," And how many we want to copy?"
4769680,4772000," We want to literally copy this amount of things."
4772000,4774480," Right."
4774480,4779120," So this is the source and there we go."
4779120,4785680," So, oh, actually, no."
4785680,4793920," We need to copy the capacity minus the frames."
4793920,4808880," I would like to maybe save capacity somewhere because copy pasting this thing everywhere is just like too tedious."
4808880,4810720," So I'm going to just do it like that."
4811600,4814720," It's too much capacity."
4814720,4819040," So, yeah, this is the count."
4819040,4821040," This is capacity."
4821040,4824080," Might as well also say, well, I mean, I'm modifying the count."
4824080,4827280," So it's not particularly great to do like that."
4828080,4828720," All right."
4828720,4831840," So frames plus net capacity minus frames."
4831840,4832080," Okay."
4832080,4833680," So this is just a single mem move."
4833680,4836000," But now we need to copy this stuff."
4836000,4838960," So mem copy."
4841840,4845360," We're going to be starting at frames."
4845360,4852720," But essentially what we need to do, we need to, since we move this thing in here, we need to find the end."
4853520,4853840," Right."
4853840,4859840," So essentially it became something, something like this."
4859840,4860800," Right."
4860800,4862560," So we have a little bit of space left."
4862560,4864320," Right."
4864320,4865600," So there's some stuff in here."
4865600,4870880," So that means it begins at here and it ends in here."
4875280,4885760," So I suppose it's more of a, oh, by the way, I didn't have to decide."
4885760,4896400," Freaking C, you have confusion between bytes and elements in a single function call."
4898560,4905440," I swear to God, like CIA designed this API to introduce buffer overflows in C programs."
4905440,4909520," It's like, dude."
4909520,4911760," Holy fuck."
4911760,4918880," In a single API call, you already create confusion between bytes and freaking elements."
4918880,4920320," My God."
4920320,4922480," It's just like, dude."
4922480,4924720," All right."
4924720,4928080," So in here, what we have to do is just like this thing."
4928080,4935040," So this is where we, yeah, so this is where we're copying."
4935040,4938240," And the source is the buffer data."
4938240,4940720," And we're copying this kind of thing."
4940720,4945600," And yeah, that's basically it."
4945600,4951280," So, and the global frame stays the same."
4951280,4953840," The global frame stays the same, essentially."
4954640,4958960," And the last situation is when everything's full, right?"
4958960,4959840," Everything's full."
4959840,4964400," And you can't really do stuff."
4964400,4968000," So frames is less than capacity."
4972960,4979440," So the last thing is the chunk is just fundamentally bigger than the capacity."
4979440,4981520," The chunk is just fundamentally bigger than the capacity."
4981520,4983200," In that case, we can simply copy."
4983200,4990800," The destination is going to be global frames."
4991760,4994960," The source is going to be buffer data."
4994960,4998720," Yeah, we can just copy whatever."
4998720,4999760," It doesn't really matter."
5002000,5005680," So essentially what I want to copy, right?"
5005680,5013200," So if you have this buffer, but you're trying to push a chunk that is way bigger than that,"
5013200,5018720," what I was thinking is that I'm going to just take this part and only push it in here."
5018720,5023440," But I just not feeling like computing the size of this thing."
5023440,5026960," I just don't feel like computing the size of this thing."
5026960,5034400," So I'm simply going to push the beginning of this buffer because it's just fucking easy, right?"
5034400,5036960," It's just like, I don't want to do that."
5036960,5037920," It's just like, no."
5040480,5048720," ""Size of uin32"" and I'm pushing the entire capacity in there."
5048720,5055840," And then I'm taking the global frames count and I'm assigning the capacity to this entire thing."
5055840,5059760," I hope I didn't make any freaking mistakes, man."
5059760,5061360," So all of that stuff is not needed."
5061360,5063040," All of that stuff is not needed."
5063040,5069200," So let me double check the code because it's kind of a finicky code."
5070480,5071600," So we have a capacity."
5071600,5077680," The amount of frames is less than the remaining stuff, the remaining amount of things."
5077680,5080560," How often do we refer to this thing?"
5080560,5085200," Okay, so the remaining amount of stuff."
5085200,5090480," So we put this stuff at the end, we just append this thing in there and we increment."
5090480,5091520," Okay, so that's correct."
5091520,5098560," So otherwise we ran out of capacity, but the capacity of the whole thing is fine."
5100480,5103760," And the capacity of this whole thing is fine."
5103760,5111520," So I'm moving to this small chunk."
5111520,5117920," And the sort of like a minus capacity in there."
5117920,5121360," Okay, so I think that should be fine."
5121360,5125280," So I don't see any significant errors in there."
5125280,5131120," And here global frames count is going to stay the same, so it doesn't need to be modified."
5131120,5133120," All right, so we increased the window."
5133120,5135920," Maybe that will create something new, something interesting."
5135920,5136480," So let's go."
5136480,5138400," And it doesn't work."
5138400,5139040," That's very cool."
5139040,5141120," It doesn't display anything."
5141120,5142720," And I wonder why."
5142720,5143440," I wonder why."
5143440,5150640," Is that because it's too big?"
5151760,5153280," That could be the case, actually."
5153280,5160320," In that case, in that case, we can just set the width always to one."
5160320,5163520," Right, so the width is so small, we can't see shit in this mist."
5163520,5165120," So that's basically the problem."
5165120,5171680," So I think it still makes sense to use it to navigate x."
5171680,5176880," But for width, we need to put one in here to be able to just at least see something."
5178160,5180720," Yeah, and it's noise."
5180720,5181600," It's still noise."
5181600,5189440," So we can't."
5189440,5202160," All right, so and if we keep increasing that window to two."
5204160,5211360," So bitrate is actually killed by this thing."
5211360,5212800," All right."
5212800,5216000," Okay, so I think I need to make a small break."
5216000,5218560," Like this is the answer I need to question."
5218560,5222160," Is this how it literally looks like?"
5222160,5224240," Is this how the sound wave looks like?"
5224240,5226400," Or did I make any mistake in here?"
5227440,5234000," And I won't be able to continue until I answer that question, right?"
5234000,5237840," Because maybe that's how literally out will look like if you just implement it like that."
5237840,5241520," Right, so I don't really know."
5241520,5244000," Anyway, so I think we need to make a small break."
5244000,5246080," And after the break we're going to continue working on that."
5246080,5247760," I need to refill my water and stuff like that."
5247760,5255280," So we spent some time trying to figure out what the hell is going on."
5255280,5259120," And essentially what we have in here."
5260000,5265440," We have a stream of samples, right?"
5265440,5267360," So and we have two channels, right?"
5267360,5271520," So essentially we have sequence of 16-bit samples like so."
5271520,5274480," And the channels are interleaved."
5274480,5278400," So the first sample is the left ear and the next one is the right."
5278400,5280240," But I don't remember exactly the order."
5280240,5281200," So that might be wrong."
5281200,5282800," It doesn't really matter."
5282800,5286480," So and essentially what I assumed, right?"
5286480,5295040," So what I assumed, we can even try to essentially like run this entire thing and see how it goes."
5295040,5296880," Yeah, let it go."
5296880,5299840," So as you can see sample size is 16-bit."
5299840,5307120," So and what I expected is that in the callback when we receive the frames,"
5308320,5314240," when we receive the frames, we would actually receive the frames in that specific format."
5314240,5320720," So we spend enormous, enormous amount of time like trying to figure out what is going on there."
5320720,5323760," But apparently this is not the case."
5323760,5328880," We do not receive these frames in the format that we loaded from the file."
5328880,5333760," They are normalized to floats internally."
5333760,5337680," Samples internally stored as floats."
5337680,5340560," And the only way for us to know that is to actually go,"
5340560,5344000," yeah, is actually like read the examples."
5344000,5347120," So, yeah."
5347120,5351520," I wish it was maybe documented somewhere in"
5351520,5355840," in the Rayleap itself, in the header, right?"
5355840,5357600," So because header is basically the"
5357600,5361280," the entry point of this entire thing, right?"
5361280,5367280," So if we take a look at the callback, so this is audio callback."
5367280,5368240," Yeah, there we go."
5368240,5371920," So this is where we attach the stream processor and stuff like that."
5373200,5379040," So I wish there was like a couple of comments in here just giving you like the rough idea,"
5379040,5384880," like what the callback can receive, but unfortunately there is none in here."
5384880,5387520," So it's kind of very easy to make a mistake."
5387520,5396080," So essentially what I did is I grouped the pair of 16-bit samples into one single sort of 32-bit frame,"
5396080,5397680," but it's not the case, right?"
5397680,5403920," So what we probably want to do instead, we want to introduce like a pair of floats."
5403920,5406720," I'm going to actually wrap them in a structure, right?"
5406720,5408800," So this is going to be left and this is going to be right."
5408800,5411840," And we're going to put those frames in here like that."
5412880,5415920," So let me quickly replace this entire stuff."
5415920,5419120," So this is going to be the frame, right?"
5419120,5423200," So this is going to be the frame and as we iterate the frames,"
5423200,5430160," we're going to just basically treat this as a sample, right?"
5430160,5433280," So this is going to be the sample itself is going to be interpolated."
5433280,5438320," And we're going to only pick that one channel because it is a mono anyway."
5438320,5440960," Yeah, it was converted from mono into stereo."
5440960,5442480," All right."
5442480,5445360," And that is basically it, I suppose."
5445360,5449520," And if we try to rebuild this entire stuff one more time."
5449520,5454240," Let me try to see and I'm going to..."
5454240,5454640," There we go."
5454640,5459280," And that looks correct, doesn't it?"
5459280,5462480," That in fact looks correct."
5468320,5469680," So yeah, that took some time."
5469680,5472960," That took a lot of mental health for me."
5472960,5475200," But we managed to figure out."
5475200,5477520," We managed to figure out."
5477520,5486560," Anyways, so now what we want to do, what we want to do shot."
5486560,5494560," We probably want to do, take the wave and split it into frequencies."
5495600,5497600," We want to split it into frequencies."
5497600,5501440," But it's kind of like a difficult thing to do."
5501440,5504720," It's kind of a difficult thing to do."
5504720,5509360," Because as soon as you mix them up, like how do you unmix them?"
5509360,5514400," It's a very interesting question."
5514400,5517600," So you usually do a Fourier transform."
5517600,5520640," You usually do Fourier transform."
5520640,5526800," And as already mentioned, you may want to watch this Veritasium video on FFT."
5526800,5528800," It actually explains it really, really well."
5528800,5531200," It explains it really, really well."
5531200,5536080," So let's actually try to create maybe a separate project"
5536080,5540960," for like experimenting with FFT and try to understand how we can even do that."
5542880,5544560," So let's go."
5544560,5548640," So this is going to be something like this."
5548640,5557120," And so let's maybe say that we're going to have n samples, right?"
5557120,5559840," Usually people do like eight samples or something like that."
5560640,5567200," And yeah, let's create maybe an input buffer, right?"
5567200,5574160," And let's, you know, iterate through all of the samples."
5574160,5577520," Let's iterate through all of the samples like so."
5577520,5584240," And try to populate this entire thing with, you know, with the samples of a certain wave."
5585440,5588240," So we're going to iterate through all of these things."
5588240,5591280," And so what kind of frequency we can put in there?"
5591280,5594080," We can put like one hertz, right?"
5594080,5595760," So let's actually put one hertz."
5595760,5597360," To do that, I'm going to do the following thing."
5597360,5602720," I'm going to create T and T is going to be from zero to one, right?"
5602720,5608560," So we can say that this chunk of samples, this sequence of samples is just like one,"
5608560,5612720," you know, one period of a sine wave, right?"
5612720,5614720," So this is going to be one period of sine wave."
5614720,5616720," So it's going to be from zero to one."
5616720,5623600," So and just take I divided by n and that gives us the value from zero to one,"
5623600,5625040," actually less than one, right?"
5625040,5626400," So less than one."
5626400,5628320," So then we're going to do sine T."
5628320,5631280," And that doesn't give us one period."
5631280,5634080," It doesn't give us one hertz, right?"
5634080,5637760," Because one hertz is going to be from zero to two pi."
5637760,5640400," So what we need to do, we need to do two pi."
5641520,5645520," So we can use a trick that I learned from Fortran."
5645520,5650400," Essentially, if you want to create a pi with the exact precision, you can do a 10,"
5650400,5653120," one, one multiplied by four."
5653120,5655120," Right?"
5655120,5662160," So essentially, yeah, one, one is a vector with 45 degrees, right?"
5662160,5668160," One vector with 45 degrees and you just multiply it by four and you get a pi."
5668800,5670560," So, and you get like a very precise pi."
5670560,5672560," We can even confirm that if you want to, right?"
5672560,5674960," So we can say this can be f and this can be pi."
5674960,5678160," And I'm going to include stdio."
5678160,5679120," I'm going to include math."
5679120,5684400," And let me do clang o f of t f of t c."
5684400,5686080," Right."
5686080,5688880," And that this has to be a 10 tooth."
5688880,5691120," There we go."
5691120,5695040," So, but on top of that, we also need to link this entire stuff with math."
5695600,5697200," And this is going to be f of t."
5697200,5697760," There we go."
5697760,5700160," So this is rather precise pi."
5700160,5704480," And why it is useful like that is because like you can have pi of any precision."
5704480,5708080," At least that's what Fortran taught me."
5709120,5709440," Right."
5709440,5712640," So in that case, you probably want to do lf."
5712640,5717680," But it doesn't give you more after the period."
5717680,5719200," So what if we put 9 in here?"
5719200,5721360," Look at that precise pi."
5721360,5723840," Is that a precise pi?"
5723840,5727760," I don't remember the digits of pi, but I mean, that's probably very precise pi."
5727760,5730000," Probably not."
5730000,5730880," I don't know."
5730880,5731360," But anyway."
5731360,5734160," So this is going to be float."
5734160,5736000," And we're going to be doing f."
5736000,5738800," So we've got some stuff in here."
5738800,5740720," We've got some stuff in here."
5740720,5744480," So let's actually print the values of those things."
5744480,5745680," Right."
5745680,5746720," So let me see."
5746720,5748400," It's going to be n plus plus i."
5748400,5752800," And f."
5756080,5756720," Got nothing."
5756720,5759440," Because we didn't provide anything in here."
5759440,5761280," There we go."
5761280,5765360," So if any single period doesn't look like a single period."
5765360,5768160," Doesn't particularly look like a single period."
5768160,5772400," Which is really strange."
5772400,5772960," Like why?"
5772960,5775360," Because it goes."
5775360,5777040," It looks like."
5777040,5780000," Yeah, it's almost there."
5780000,5780240," Right."
5780240,5783680," So if we actually include n."
5785120,5785360," Right."
5785360,5786640," If we actually include n."
5786640,5791840," So let's put it like this."
5791840,5809840," Yeah, that's what I wanted to think."
5809840,5810000," Yeah."
5810000,5814320," So essentially since we don't get to the n."
5814880,5815680," precisely."
5815680,5818640," It doesn't really become zero."
5818640,5820160," But it's actually getting there."
5820160,5820480," Right."
5820480,5820720," Okay."
5820720,5822720," So that's like a single."
5822720,5823520," Single hertz."
5823520,5824720," Single thing."
5824720,5827280," So I think that makes sense."
5827280,5828320," It's a single period."
5828320,5831040," All right."
5831040,5834720," So we can try to mix up more frequencies than there."
5834720,5838640," So we can, for instance, add a frequency of."
5840160,5840800," Three hertz."
5840800,5841200," Three hertz."
5841200,5841520," Right."
5841520,5843600," So three periods within a single thing."
5843600,5848160," And how can we sort of uncompress that information?"
5848160,5854880," How can we uncompress that information?"
5854880,5856080," That's a very interesting question."
5856080,5858320," So if you watch that veritasium video."
5858320,5860640," If you watch that veritasium video."
5860640,5868880," You will learn that if you take your samples and multiply them by a wave of a certain frequency."
5870080,5870400," Right."
5870400,5873680," So let's actually."
5873680,5874400," Let's actually see."
5874400,5876400," So in the veritasium video."
5876400,5880880," It's actually demonstrated really well with visualizations and stuff like that."
5882800,5887920," So essentially let's assume that you have some sort of like a wave like this."
5887920,5893760," And you basically take a wave of a certain frequency."
5893760,5900000," And just for each sample, for each sample, you multiply the samples together."
5900000,5903520," What you're going to end up with is another wave."
5903520,5906880," It is another wave."
5908560,5908880," Right."
5908880,5913440," And if this specific frequency is part of your signal."
5913440,5919520," You're going to end up with a wave that has a positive area under the curve."
5919520,5923840," So that's the property we're taking advantage of."
5923840,5925440," If it's not part of your signal."
5925440,5926880," If it is not part of the signal."
5926880,5928960," It's going to have some parts below zero."
5928960,5929200," Right."
5929200,5932080," But if it is part of your signal, it's going to be actually above."
5932080,5938160," So the sum of the products of a sample and that wave is going to be positive."
5938560,5942000," And the sum, basically the area itself."
5942000,5946160," The bigger the area, the bigger the amplitude of that specific frequency in there."
5946160,5947680," Right."
5947680,5950080," So the bigger the frequency."
5950080,5951200," But here's the interesting thing."
5951200,5957600," If the signal is shifted, it's not going to work."
5957600,5957840," Right."
5957840,5961840," Because maybe your frequency was not actually sine."
5961840,5963440," It was actually cosine."
5963440,5968000," So because of that, you have to multiply both by sine and cosine simultaneously."
5968000,5971600," You have to keep track of sines and cosine frequencies simultaneously."
5971600,5974000," That's one of the things you'll have to do."
5974000,5977280," But for now, we only have sines."
5977280,5979760," So we can try to do that."
5979760,5983200," So and how we're going to be storing the frequencies."
5983200,5983680," Right."
5983680,5985360," So how are we going to be storing the frequencies?"
5985360,5990480," We're going to be storing the frequencies in the array of the same size as we have the input."
5990480,5995600," So essentially, the first element and the output is going to be zero hertz."
5995600,5999600," The element one is going to be one hertz."
5999600,6001200," So the element two is going to be two hertz."
6001200,6004400," The element three is going to be three hertz and so on and so forth."
6004400,6011840," So effectively, you can't measure the frequencies higher than n hertz anyway."
6011840,6017520," Because the frequencies that are higher than n hertz are actually sub-samples."
6017520,6018560," Right."
6018560,6021440," So they're going to be between the samples somewhere here."
6021440,6022880," They're like impossible to measure."
6022880,6027280," And that's why you can't have more than n elements in the output of FFT."
6027280,6029520," Does it make sense?"
6029520,6031440," Does it make sense?"
6031440,6037600," Because essentially, like imagine you have three samples in the data."
6037600,6039600," Like you can..."
6039600,6041280," Actually, this is four."
6041280,6044720," You can measure the frequency of like four."
6044720,6048080," So wave basically repeating itself four times."
6048080,6051200," But more than four, you can't see that because the wave basically"
6051200,6054240," has a lot of information just between the samples."
6054240,6057360," You see, like you have a very high frequency."
6057360,6060400," But since you have like a small amount of samples,"
6060400,6063600," you literally can't see that you don't have enough resolution."
6063600,6069840," And because of that, if you have n samples, you can only measure n frequencies."
6069840,6072240," Starting from zero up to n hertz."
6072240,6074400," Does it make sense?"
6074400,6076560," Hopefully that makes sense."
6076560,6081840," So anyway."
6081840,6083120," So what that means?"
6083120,6084960," What that means?"
6084960,6088800," We need to iterate all of the frequencies that we need to measure."
6088800,6091760," We need to iterate all of the frequencies that we need to measure."
6091760,6094560," So we're going to actually denote these frequencies as F."
6094560,6097040," So we're going to be iterating it like this."
6098080,6100560," So the next thing."
6100560,6106560," We're going to be in out F, we're going to be accumulating the sums."
6106560,6109120," We're going to be accumulating actually products."
6109120,6110560," Right."
6110560,6112320," So we're going to be iterating through the samples."
6112320,6115520," We're iterating through the samples."
6117680,6123920," And of course, we're going to be taking t, which is the value from zero to one."
6123920,6124240," Right."
6124240,6125040," From zero to one."
6125040,6130320," And we're taking the ith sample and we multiply it by the sine."
6130320,6131680," Two pi."
6131680,6136160," Two pi multiplied by t multiplied by frequency."
6136160,6137760," Right."
6137760,6142160," So that F actually specifies the frequency of the sine wave."
6142160,6144720," This is the frequency of the sine wave."
6144720,6147600," Essentially, it would be better to actually write it like this."
6147600,6150400," Because one period of a sine wave is two pi."
6150400,6155040," If F is two, it's going to be four pi."
6155040,6156720," So that means two periods."
6156720,6158480," Three F is three periods."
6158480,6160400," One period is one hertz."
6160400,6163360," So we're iterating from zero to n hertz."
6163360,6163600," Right."
6163600,6167280," So we're just iterating through all of the like hertz in here."
6167280,6169280," And one hertz, it's one period."
6169280,6170560," One period is two pi."
6170560,6173600," So we're multiplying those things like this."
6173600,6177040," And we're adding them to the final frequency."
6177040,6184080," And as I already said, if out F is positive, that means that frequency is present."
6184080,6186880," It is present in the input."
6186880,6189040," Right."
6189040,6191120," And if it's zero, it's probably not present."
6191120,6194800," And the value of this thing tells you the amplitude."
6194800,6197680," How much of that frequency is present in there."
6197680,6199600," How much of that frequency is present in there."
6199600,6201120," All right."
6201120,6209040," So here, by the way, we are mixing up one hertz and three hertz frequencies."
6209920,6211520," So this is what we're mixing up."
6211520,6214240," One hertz frequency, three hertz frequency."
6214240,6216880," And here we're unmixing them."
6216880,6218560," Unmixing them."
6218560,6222720," So now let's actually try to print them in unmixed form."
6222720,6222880," Right."
6222880,6225600," So I'm iterating through all of the frequencies."
6225600,6228800," Maybe it would be better to actually use F in here to indicate that."
6228800,6229680," So this is F."
6230400,6235760," And what I'm going to be printing, I'm going to be printing the F itself."
6235760,6240960," And for that specific frequency, I'm going to be printing the value, the output."
6240960,6243360," So let me see."
6243360,6248400," So let's actually print two digits after the period."
6248400,6250160," And it's going to be out F."
6250160,6253120," So, okay."
6253120,6257600," Look at that carefully, my dear."
6257600,6260880," One, three."
6260880,6270000," One, three."
6271520,6273280," Let's change three to two."
6273280,6279520," One, two."
6279520,6287280," So, we mixed different frequencies and we just unmixed them."
6287280,6289680," Right."
6289680,6297520," And we know that this frequency is present in the signal because its value here is positive."
6298960,6301440," This is Fourier transform."
6301440,6304640," Have you heard that scary word before?"
6304640,6307200," Have you heard that scary word before?"
6307200,6310240," Well, that's basically what it means."
6310240,6311840," There's also this thing in here."
6311840,6312080," Right."
6312080,6312720," So negative."
6312720,6315200," So this sort of like a mirror in each other in this case."
6326560,6328400," But here's the interesting thing."
6328400,6336960," If you replace sine with cosine, you can't see shit in this mist."
6336960,6341040," You can't see scheiße in this mist."
6353920,6358000," So the way you handle that, you actually handle both of them."
6358000,6359680," You keep track of both of them."
6359680,6364480," So you do something like sine and you do something like cosine."
6364480,6368640," That's what you have to do, meine Freunde."
6368640,6370480," So this has to be like this."
6370480,6372640," And so the first one is sine."
6372640,6374960," The second one is cosine."
6376960,6380560," And so here we can actually print both of them."
6380560,6380880," Right."
6380880,6381360," To f."
6381360,6384560," So this is sine."
6384560,6387840," And this is cosine."
6387840,6390240," There we go."
6390240,6397280," And yeah, I forgot to change this thing to cosine."
6397280,6399120," Super quick."
6399120,6400080," There we go."
6400080,6401920," So we keep track of both of them."
6401920,6402080," Right."
6402080,6403120," We keep track of both of them."
6403120,6407120," So and if at any point."
6407120,6408080," So we can even say."
6408080,6408640," All right."
6408640,6410160," So one hertz is going to be cosine."
6410160,6412560," And two hertz is going to be sine."
6412560,6415120," And all of that is going to be present."
6415120,6417360," Like in both of these things."
6417360,6417520," Right."
6417520,6419920," So we're keeping track of these things simultaneously."
6419920,6426000," There is another cool trick to keep track of sines and cosines simultaneously."
6426000,6428000," And I think chat already got that trick."
6428000,6435520," So who knows the trick that you can use to keep track of sines and cosines simultaneously."
6435520,6438480," Can anybody repeat that?"
6438480,6442480," So complex numbers."
6442480,6444080," Complex numbers."
6444080,6446800," Specifically the Euler's formula."
6446800,6448720," Euler's formula."
6449920,6454320," Euler's formula."
6454320,6459200," Look at that choice."
6459200,6461440," So essentially."
6461440,6465280," You have cosine and sine."
6465280,6470160," And if you represent them as the values of a complex number."
6470160,6471600," Through the Euler's formula."
6471600,6476480," You essentially keep track of all of them simultaneously."
6478400,6478640," Right."
6478640,6483680," And I'm going to actually put that in the description."
6483680,6486320," So this is the Euler's formula."
6486320,6489680," Or the Euler's formula."
6489680,6496000," So it's an Euler's formula."
6496000,6498800," Which is kind of cool."
6499600,6500480," So essentially."
6500480,6501680," As you can see."
6501680,6502400," Look at that."
6502400,6503440," So we have X."
6503440,6510560," And X is essentially the frequency."
6510560,6513680," It's that value that we put in sine and cosine."
6513680,6515520," So this is the X."
6515520,6516720," Right."
6516720,6520000," So that means instead of keeping track of these two pairs."
6521040,6523920," We can actually have a single complex number."
6523920,6525680," So as far as I know."
6525680,6528320," C does have complex numbers."
6528320,6529520," C complex numbers."
6529520,6537360," Yeah."
6537360,6538080," Complex number."
6538080,6538800," Arithmetics."
6538800,6540560," Let's take a look at that."
6540560,6542080," Complex number."
6542080,6542800," Arithmetics."
6544160,6546080," Yes, yes, yes, yes."
6546080,6547280," So essentially you can like."
6547280,6549360," It's a parameterized type."
6549360,6549600," Right."
6549600,6551040," You can say double complex."
6551040,6552560," Or float complex."
6552560,6553520," Or whatever."
6553520,6555440," And we also need to include complex.h."
6556480,6557760," So let me quickly do that."
6557760,6560000," Complex."
6560000,6564160," And we're going to say that we have complex."
6564160,6567440," So first comes the floats."
6567440,6569120," So this is going to be that."
6569120,6571600," Now."
6571600,6578320," So luckily you can just assign real numbers to complex ones."
6578320,6580720," And they're going to be automatically converted to complex ones."
6580720,6580880," Right."
6580880,6581920," So that's totally fine."
6581920,6583600," So and in here."
6584640,6588880," Instead of writing like sine, cosine, blah, blah, blah."
6588880,6589920," What we can do."
6589920,6591840," We can use the Euler's formula."
6591840,6593040," Which says that."
6593040,6594880," E to the power of this thing."
6594880,6598320," Is going to be the sum of cosine and sine simultaneously."
6598320,6598480," Right."
6598480,6599920," So that means we can do."
6599920,6601040," Caxp."
6601040,6602240," Which is the function."
6602240,6603280," For complex numbers."
6603280,6604960," For rising a complex number to."
6604960,6606160," Natural."
6606160,6607520," Thingy."
6607520,6607680," Right."
6607680,6609040," So."
6609040,6609840," Cxp."
6609840,6611840," Computes the complex base."
6611840,6612720," E exponential."
6612720,6613360," Right."
6613360,6614160," So it's basically."
6614160,6616560," Like this."
6616560,6620240," So we put this thing in here."
6620240,6623200," And that thing becomes simultaneously."
6623200,6625120," Sine and cosine."
6625120,6626400," But on top of that."
6626400,6628720," We also have to multiply it by imaginary number."
6628720,6629440," To actually."
6629440,6632160," Be compliant with the Euler formula."
6632160,6633280," Because in the Euler's formula."
6633280,6634400," You put i in here."
6634400,6636320," So you have to put additional i in here."
6636880,6639200," And that is it."
6639200,6641120," So we multiply it with the input."
6641120,6641760," Like so."
6641760,6643040," And the output is going to be."
6643040,6644800," Like this."
6644800,6647120," So this is one of the tricks that you can do in here."
6647120,6650560," And you probably may want to use complex numbers in here."
6650560,6652160," Because different libraries."
6652160,6657600," Maybe have some sort of like a more optimal implementation for complex numbers."
6657600,6658800," Maybe it's going to be faster."
6658800,6659680," But I don't really know."
6659680,6666240," The fact that a lot of languages have built-in support for complex numbers."
6666240,6668320," Like in C and in Fortran."
6668320,6669200," Especially in Fortran."
6669200,6671280," There is a built-in support for complex numbers."
6671280,6674880," Kind of suggest that the compilers probably do something special for them."
6675760,6677440," But this is just like my hypothesis."
6677440,6677680," Right?"
6677680,6678480," So maybe they don't."
6678480,6680080," Maybe you can implement it from scratch."
6680080,6681200," And it's going to be the same performance."
6681200,6681920," But who knows?"
6681920,6683840," So anyway."
6683840,6685840," So you can just do that like this."
6685840,6689040," And this is complex numbers."
6689040,6693360," And to print real and imaginary parts."
6693360,6695120," So in real part, we're going to have cosine."
6695120,6697520," In the imaginary part, we're going to have sine."
6697520,6698720," So we're going to just take this."
6698720,6700240," And we're going to say C real."
6700240,6701680," Right?"
6701680,6702880," So this is the C real."
6702880,6705200," And this is a C emag."
6705760,6706160," Right?"
6706160,6706960," Imagine it part."
6706960,6710080," And let's actually try to run this entire thing."
6710080,6711920," And let's go here."
6711920,6713280," And there we go."
6713280,6717520," So it keeps track of all of them simultaneously."
6717520,6720640," It keeps track of all of them simultaneously."
6720640,6726720," So the problem with this algorithm is that it's square."
6726720,6733440," So we have in our original music thingy."
6734320,6736080," And our original music thingy."
6736080,6738240," So it's main.c"
6738240,6740800," This amount of samples."
6740800,6742160," That's actually a lot of samples."
6742160,6742880," I'm not going to lie."
6742880,6744720," That's a lot of samples."
6747360,6749520," So if you square."
6749520,6749520," So if you square."
6749520,6752480," This is how many iterations."
6752480,6757040," How many complex multiplications you have to do per frame."
6757040,6760960," Per frame."
6760960,6763120," 60 frames per second."
6763120,6774480," It's not really going to work well."
6774480,6778880," So this kind of like a four-year transform is actually like it kind of sucks."
6778880,6780720," It kind of fucking sucks."
6781600,6782720," So what we can do about it."
6782720,6788080," So if you watch Veritasfilm video."
6788080,6790080," There is a very interesting trick."
6790080,6794000," That is based on a very interesting observation."
6794000,6794800," I would say."
6794800,6796720," Very interesting observation."
6797120,6797360," Okay."
6797360,6799920," So let's actually take this entire thing and comment it out."
6799920,6802000," Let's comment out everything in here."
6802000,6804960," So let's iterate through the frequencies."
6804960,6806800," Let's iterate through the frequencies."
6806800,6810000," Let's actually print the frequencies like so."
6811760,6812720," So it's going to go like this."
6812720,6817360," And let's iterate through available samples."
6817360,6827200," And the way we're going to do all of that."
6827200,6829600," So I'm going to just print this stuff like this."
6829600,6832080," So maybe I'm going to remove space from here and put it in here."
6832080,6833040," So this is going to be f."
6833040,6837360," sinf 2 pi t 2."
6837360,6840880," And let's put this thing in here."
6840880,6842080," And then it's going to print that."
6842080,6843440," n."
6843440,6846880," So let's basically print all of the values of the sign."
6846880,6848800," For all of the frequencies that we care about."
6848800,6853040," Okay."
6853040,6856480," So let's actually also limit the amount of things."
6856480,6856800," Yeah."
6856800,6857200," There we go."
6857200,6861040," So this doesn't really look particularly great."
6861040,6862800," There we go."
6862800,6864080," So that looks all right."
6864080,6868240," And maybe I would even put like something like 5 in here."
6868240,6869760," Yeah."
6869760,6870160," There we go."
6870880,6878800," So this particular thing kind of sucks."
6878800,6882000," What if we had more frequencies like 16?"
6882000,6882880," Yeah."
6882880,6883680," That's a little bit better."
6883680,6887840," Do you notice anything particularly interesting in here?"
6887840,6888960," Chat."
6888960,6892000," Do you notice anything particularly interesting?"
6892560,6897120," Like for example, we can take this value and try to search for this value."
6897120,6902480," It kind of repeats."
6902480,6904400," Don't they?"
6904400,6906640," It can repeat."
6908080,6912800," In fact, a lot of them repeats."
6912800,6914000," Like what the fuck?"
6914000,6914080," What the fuck?"
6914080,6923440," Yeah."
6923440,6924800," And it's very much symmetric."
6924800,6926880," It is very much symmetric."
6927600,6935520," So, and this is basically the observation that an algorithm called FFT, Fast Fourier Transform, uses."
6935520,6936720," Right."
6936720,6939040," It exploits this symmetry."
6939040,6941040," It literally exploits."
6941040,6945440," Because you really don't have to multiply by all of the values."
6945440,6954240," You can actually cut down the amount of computations in half."
6954240,6957840," You can cut down the amount of computations in half."
6958400,6962240," So, the way you do that is kind of interesting, actually."
6962240,6963040," It is kind of interesting."
6963040,6976400," You want to consider odd and even frequencies."
6976400,6978720," Let's consider only the even frequencies."
6978720,6982480," Actually, not even frequencies, but even samples, right?"
6982480,6987120," It's really important to distinguish samples and frequencies, right?"
6987120,6989520," So, as an input, we get samples."
6989520,6991920," And as an output, we get frequencies."
6991920,6995760," And the fun thing is that you can convert back, right?"
6995760,6999520," If you know frequencies, you can quite easily just like do this."
6999520,7001360," Right."
7001360,7002160," Why not?"
7002160,7003440," So, that's actually possible."
7003440,7006800," But anyway, let's consider the even samples, right?"
7006800,7008160," Let's consider the even samples."
7008160,7012720," So, it's going to be S, I plus 2, right?"
7012720,7015200," And I'm going to print this thing like that."
7016960,7023440," So, for the frequency, let's actually consider the even samples for the frequency 1, right?"
7023440,7024480," For the frequency 1."
7024480,7027600," And let's print them like this."
7027600,7033920," So, this is going to be sinf, 2 pi, t, and the frequency f."
7035600,7038080," So, let's try to run this entire thing."
7038080,7042240," So, we also have to compute the t, otherwise it's not going to work."
7042240,7043600," Right."
7043600,7046400," So, we probably don't want to do any of these things."
7049920,7051520," So, here are the samples."
7051520,7057280," I would love to, I would love to maybe limit their size because they're too big."
7057280,7058080," They're kind of too big."
7058080,7059920," And on top of that,"
7059920,7064880," let's maybe print the frequency for which we're rendering all that."
7064880,7067280," 0, 2, zoom."
7067280,7068800," So, this is going to be that."
7069520,7071440," This space shouldn't go there."
7071440,7072000," There we go."
7072000,7075760," So, this is the frequency 1, the 1 hertz."
7075760,7080720," And that's basically the even samples, even samples for that specific frequency."
7082240,7089600," So, now, let's actually consider a different frequency, a different frequency on the second half."
7089600,7090080," Right."
7090080,7095840," So, essentially, if we have 16 frequencies, so let's actually put them like this."
7095840,7101520," So, this is sort of like 4 frequencies."
7101520,7103360," Oh, my God."
7103360,7104000," It's painful."
7104000,7104640," It's painful."
7104640,7110240," So, this is 8 and this is 16."
7110240,7114720," So, in fact, what we do, we kind of split the frequencies in half."
7114720,7115200," Right."
7115200,7122240," So, we split the samples in odd and even and frequencies in the left half and in the right half."
7122240,7126800," So, right now, we're looking at the frequency 1, which is located here."
7126800,7129360," We're not looking at zeros 1 because it's not particularly interesting."
7129360,7131120," We're looking at 1."
7131120,7132240," Right."
7132240,7135520," And the samples for that specific frequency is this."
7135520,7139520," So, now, let's actually take at this frequency."
7140480,7140800," Right."
7140800,7141920," At this one."
7141920,7148320," So, we can find that frequency by actually adding half of the samples or half of the frequencies."
7148320,7148720," Right."
7148720,7152880," So, n is amount of samples and amount of frequencies."
7152880,7154080," How many samples we have."
7154080,7156960," This is how many frequencies we can measure effectively."
7156960,7157200," Right."
7157200,7158720," That's quite important to remember."
7158720,7170080," And if we try now to print the samples for that specific frequency, we may notice something interesting."
7170080,7172240," They're the same."
7174240,7182480," For the even samples, the first half of the frequencies is the same as the second half of the frequencies."
7182480,7184000," Right."
7184880,7193920," For all of the even samples, even, specifically only even ones, these frequencies, these values are going to be the same as this one."
7193920,7198240," So, but it's not particularly the case for odd ones."
7198240,7198480," Right."
7198480,7200800," So, if we do the odd ones, right, we start with one."
7200800,7202320," That will effectively give us the odd ones."
7202320,7204320," They're not particularly the same."
7205680,7207680," But they're actually negative of each other."
7207680,7213840," So, on the left half, whatever the value you have, on the right half is going to be just negative of this."
7213840,7217920," But they are still kind of, by absolute value, they're kind of still the same."
7217920,7219760," They're kind of still the same."
7219760,7227040," Which means that we can cut the amount of all of the computations in half."
7227040,7229040," Right."
7229040,7232560," By iterating only the first half of the frequency."
7233200,7237760," Because then, we can derive the second half of the frequencies from that."
7237760,7242480," So, we can literally split this stuff in half."
7242480,7245280," So, let's actually give it a try."
7245280,7246720," Let's try to do that specifically."
7246720,7251360," So, the algorithm here we have is like iterates all of the frequencies."
7251360,7252800," We're iterating all of the frequencies."
7252800,7257760," And in here, we're going to be iterating only half of the frequencies."
7258960,7260560," So, this is going to be f."
7260560,7263600," We're starting from zero and half of that."
7263600,7265200," So, there we go."
7265200,7269520," And we are starting iteration"
7269520,7272720," like this."
7272720,7277280," So, we set this thing to zero."
7278160,7283440," And I think we're going to set f on the other half to zero as well."
7283440,7288960," So, we're computing left half of the frequencies and right half of the frequencies simultaneously."
7288960,7290160," Right."
7290160,7292480," So, here we are considering even indices."
7292480,7293360," Right."
7293360,7294640," We're considering even indices."
7294640,7303760," And then, we take c exponent i and we just do out f plus."
7303760,7305040," Right."
7305040,7305840," Out f plus."
7305840,7311200," And since out f plus n2 is the same."
7311760,7312080," Right."
7312080,7313760," It's the same."
7313760,7314720," We can just..."
7314720,7318160," Yeah, we have to multiply it by the input in here."
7318160,7318400," Right."
7318400,7323440," We can just say this is equal to that."
7323440,7327200," Yes, yes, yes."
7327200,7334400," Actually, you know what we can do?"
7334400,7337760," We can put this thing like this."
7337760,7342400," So, first one is float, complex."
7342400,7343920," So, this is some sort of a value."
7343920,7348320," And we add this thing and this thing simultaneously."
7348320,7354320," So, we don't do this exact computation, which is rather have a computation twice."
7354320,7355520," We only do it once."
7355520,7358560," But this is only for even ones."
7358560,7358800," Right."
7358800,7363680," As for odd, we know that this value has to be negative for the second half."
7363680,7364000," Right."
7364000,7365840," It has to be negative for the second half."
7365840,7368560," So, this is going to be odd."
7368560,7371040," And we start computations like this."
7371040,7374480," And we just subtract the second half."
7374480,7376000," And there you go."
7376000,7379120," So, this is equivalent to the algorithm below."
7379120,7380720," Right."
7380720,7384400," So, this is this algorithm that iterates all of the frequencies."
7384400,7387200," This one iterates only half of the frequencies."
7387200,7392880," Exploiting this symmetry where essentially even samples"
7392960,7398160," are equal for the left half of the frequencies and the right half of the frequencies."
7398160,7399200," Right."
7399200,7403360," So, we can see if that actually changes anything."
7403360,7406000," So, I'm going to comment out the original thing in here."
7406640,7407360," Right."
7407360,7411840," And this is sort of like a sped up fourier transform."
7411840,7412000," Right."
7412000,7414400," So, this is an original slow fourier transform."
7414400,7417360," And this one is a little bit sped up because we don't iterate."
7419360,7421040," We don't iterate all of the frequencies."
7421040,7423360," We iterate only half of the frequencies."
7423360,7425760," We iterate only half of the frequencies."
7425760,7427920," So, and let's actually see."
7427920,7428960," Does it change anything?"
7428960,7434240," It kind of worked, I think, to some extent."
7435920,7436560," No, we didn't."
7436560,7437600," Right."
7437600,7441680," Yeah, so it's plus two."
7441680,7444960," Or did it?"
7444960,7445840," I think it did."
7445840,7446480," Wait, wait a second."
7446480,7447920," It did."
7447920,7450880," So, the frequencies that we mixed up were one and two."
7450880,7454640," One and two."
7454640,7455280," It worked."
7455280,7457040," What the fuck?"
7458000,7460320," So, but this time we actually take more samples."
7460320,7462640," We can reduce the amount of samples to the original one."
7462640,7463200," Yeah, there we go."
7463200,7464800," So, that's why I was confused."
7464800,7467840," Because I did the original on the small amount of samples."
7467840,7468160," Right."
7468160,7468880," We scaled it up."
7468880,7469600," It became too big."
7469600,7470560," Right."
7470560,7471600," So, this is what we had."
7471600,7474320," And let's actually do the following thing."
7474320,7477360," I'm going to do something like this."
7477360,7480960," I'm going to comment this thing out using the c super comment."
7480960,7482560," So, this is a c super comment."
7482560,7486080," So, this is going to be something like this."
7486080,7488160," And let's use original and compare."
7488160,7489520," Is it like a regional one?"
7489520,7492000," It is kind of like a regional one."
7492000,7493440," I think it returns the same values."
7493440,7499200," Yeah, so the signs of numbers here are a little bit different."
7499200,7501840," But this is because the method of computing this stuff is different."
7501840,7506480," But like the values themselves are really close to what we expect."
7506480,7508240," So, we cut the amount of computations in two."
7508240,7512800," But you may argue that that doesn't really change anything."
7513760,7515840," The asymptotic is still square."
7515840,7517520," Like you just like cut it in half."
7517520,7524400," But apparently, this symmetry repeats itself."
7524400,7530160," This symmetry repeats itself on these split indices as well."
7530720,7535920," If you just take these even indices and try to do FFT on them."
7535920,7539600," Again, that symmetry will still repeat."
7539600,7542880," That symmetry will still repeat."
7542880,7547600," And if you do FFT on the odd indices, that symmetry will still repeat."
7547600,7555200," And since you do FFT, you can also split them even more on even and odd."
7555200,7557760," And those things are more on even and odd."
7557760,7567120," Thus, you are basically implementing divide and conquer algorithm, which turns this entire thing into n log n."
7567120,7569760," Does it make sense?"
7575680,7587120," So, yeah."
7587120,7588320," That's essentially the trick."
7588320,7594800," But the problem is that I do not fully understand this algorithm."
7596160,7600240," It may look like I just explained you the entire algorithm."
7600240,7602960," I do not fully understand it."
7602960,7605680," Because I don't..."
7605680,7611360," Like this pattern, this repetition pattern doesn't click in my head."
7611360,7612320," Right."
7612320,7614560," I can explain you this kind of thing."
7614560,7622800," But then I can't really synthesize the actual final algorithm out of these sort of logical steps."
7623440,7624400," I just can't do that."
7624400,7627440," I can explain you FFT up until this point."
7627440,7635840," But after that point, my brain just doesn't have enough information or mental model to do this kind of thing."
7635840,7645520," So, because of that, we're going to actually steal the actual implementations of FFT from the internet."
7645520,7650400," Because I'm capable of explaining to you the FFT up until this point."
7650400,7652160," That's everything I know about FFT."
7652160,7653680," I cannot go any further."
7653680,7656000," But that's it."
7656000,7656800," Right."
7656800,7663520," Maybe at some point in my career, I will understand it enough that I'll walk you through the entire logic"
7663520,7665440," and implement everything line by line."
7665440,7669040," But right now, only up until this point."
7669040,7672320," Probably up until this point."
7672320,7678800," So, let's actually find, I think, Rosetta code had an FFT implementation."
7678800,7679920," We can steal some of them."
7679920,7681840," Right."
7681840,7682880," Fast Fourier transform."
7682880,7683520," Yeah."
7683520,7689440," So, there's some implementation in C, but I tried to copy-paste it."
7689440,7690480," It didn't really work for me."
7690480,7691600," It actually sec-faulted."
7692720,7695040," So, I don't think we can trust this one."
7695040,7697200," I don't think we can trust this one."
7697200,7700080," We can try to pick a different one."
7700080,7702240," For example, like a Python."
7702240,7702480," Yeah."
7702480,7705680," And in Python, you can actually clearly see what's going on in here."
7705680,7709600," So, ah, goddammit, it actually went wild."
7709600,7711440," All right."
7711440,7712560," So, here's the FFT."
7712560,7714320," We accept samples in here."
7714960,7716560," And that's an interesting thing."
7716560,7718000," We take a length of the samples."
7718000,7721440," And if it's less or equal than one, we just return out of this recursion."
7721440,7722800," So, this is kind of interesting."
7722800,7729840," If you have one sample, the Fourier transform of one sample is going to be that sample."
7729840,7732320," That specific sample."
7732320,7733280," Right."
7733280,7735600," Because, yeah."
7735600,7738720," Essentially, what you're going to have, what you're going to have,"
7738720,7740720," you're going to have one frequency."
7740720,7743200," And that frequency is going to be zero."
7744080,7746480," Which means that this entire thing is going to be one."
7746480,7748080," Right."
7748080,7752160," So, if you take e to the power of zero, you're going to get one."
7752160,7755520," So, you get back the original sample."
7755520,7760800," So, Fourier transform of one sample is that sample itself."
7760800,7760960," Right."
7760960,7762720," It's sort of an identity of that thing."
7762720,7763760," So, it makes sense."
7763760,7769600," So, the next thing we do, we split into even indices and into the odd indices."
7769600,7771360," It's pretty straightforward."
7771360,7774960," Like here, we're using Python slice syntax."
7774960,7777680," And here, we supply stride."
7777680,7779120," So, we supply stride."
7779120,7783040," And as you can see, we do FFT on the even ones and the odd ones."
7783040,7784480," So, yeah."
7784480,7785120," That's what we do."
7786000,7786320," Okay."
7786320,7791120," And we get basically the frequencies of even ones and the odd ones."
7791120,7794560," But these actually frequencies split in half."
7794560,7794800," Right."
7794800,7796320," So, this is half of the frequencies."
7796320,7800800," And to compute the final frequencies, we iterate through all of the odd ones."
7800800,7801040," Right."
7801040,7802880," We iterate through all of the odd ones."
7802880,7806080," And we multiply them by minus two."
7806080,7807200," Right."
7807200,7813280," So, what I noticed about a lot of FFT implementations online is that they always put minus in here."
7813280,7816000," Right."
7816000,7817520," They always put minus in here."
7817520,7824240," Well, in all of my logical conclusions, I didn't see any negative thing in here."
7824240,7827920," But all of the things online, they always put this minus in here."
7827920,7829040," Does anybody know why?"
7829040,7831600," Is that something important?"
7831600,7833600," Or is this just a convention?"
7833600,7838640," Is this just a convention?"
7838640,7839680," I don't really know."
7839680,7840720," But anyway."
7840720,7844080," So, we take the odd ones and we multiply this like that."
7844080,7847600," Interestingly, we only multiply it by t."
7847600,7848640," Right."
7848640,7849840," We only multiply it by t."
7849840,7852640," K over n is basically t."
7852640,7855920," Because if you take a look, we iterate them from 0 to n."
7855920,7858480," And t is i over n."
7858480,7860160," So, it's a value from 0 to 1."
7860160,7864960," So, in here, we iterate from k to half of the n, though, half of the n."
7864960,7869280," And we divide it by n, essentially."
7869280,7869520," Right."
7869520,7870960," So, that's basically what we have."
7870960,7875680," So, I think it's convention."
7875680,7879280," The f of t is sine and the reverse f of t is mine."
7879280,7879840," Okay."
7879840,7880400," That makes sense."
7880400,7882640," So, it doesn't really matter, right, in that specific case."
7882640,7883520," It's more of a convention."
7883520,7888720," Since, like, the complex numbers are like circular entities,"
7888720,7890560," I would expect it's just like..."
7890560,7893280," It's probably rotating in a different direction, basically."
7893280,7895360," But it's ultimately the same, right?"
7895360,7897440," So, anyway."
7897440,7903360," So, we sort of, like, multiply the odd things by whatever we have in here."
7903360,7904640," Excluding frequencies, right?"
7904640,7907920," So, I also multiply by a specific frequency in here."
7907920,7909040," They kind of emit that."
7909040,7911200," They can emit that."
7911200,7918560," And then, the final thing is a concatenation of even plus this t and minus this t."
7918560,7920320," So, yeah."
7920320,7924480," I understand in f of t literally, like, everything."
7924480,7927200," Like, I understood this logic to you."
7927200,7929040," I understand everything here."
7929040,7933840," But I don't understand these specific three lines."
7933840,7936960," These specific three lines make no sense to me."
7936960,7941600," And this is because I do not know underlying math behind this kind of thing."
7941600,7944880," I don't know how you come to this specific conclusion."
7944880,7948880," I do know that it's based on this symmetry that I showed you."
7948880,7951840," Right."
7951840,7955040," But why exactly this thing?"
7955040,7957440," I have no idea."
7958080,7959520," I literally have no idea."
7959520,7966320," All right."
7966320,7970160," So, and this is probably what we want to implement instead."
7970160,7974480," Because using f of t in our case is going to be very important."
7975280,7976640," We're going to be there for it."
7976640,7981440," So, start, end, frequency."
7981440,7982000," No!"
7982000,7984640," The third parameter in here is the step."
7984640,7986560," With which step you're taking elements."
7986560,7993600," Is there a slow Fourier transform to compare it to?"
7993600,7994240," Yes."
7994240,7994720," Here it is."
7994720,7996960," This is the slow Fourier transform."
7996960,7999920," I don't know if it makes sense to compare them."
7999920,8003280," So, one is n squared, another one n log n."
8004880,8008560," So, it's actually like, you know, pretty, pretty significant speed up."
8008560,8013840," All righty."
8013840,8016160," So, let's try to maybe implement that."
8016160,8019200," So, maybe I'm going to go ahead and first implement d of t."
8019200,8026800," And in here, we're going to accept in n and complex out."
8026800,8030080," So, what I want to do, I want to just like, well, in here,"
8030080,8032160," I think we're going to be just accepting this kind of stuff."
8032720,8036400," And I just want to factor out the original thing in here."
8036400,8038160," I just want to factor out."
8038160,8041040," Yep."
8041040,8041920," So, that's cool."
8041920,8042880," So, we factor it out."
8042880,8047120," And let's try to implement fft."
8047120,8052240," So, fft is probably going to have this similar signature."
8054800,8055200," Okay."
8055200,8059360," And let me, let me see."
8059360,8062880," So, the thing is, the thing is,"
8062880,8067040," can we easily"
8067040,8074880," just do that?"
8080000,8090800," I think we could probably, basically, collect all of the even and odd things."
8090800,8094960," Do we?"
8094960,8096480," We don't even need samples in here."
8096480,8097920," That's actually kind of cool."
8097920,8099920," We can shuffle around input."
8100640,8105600," So, all of the odd things are first and all of the even are second."
8105600,8109440," And then we can split, we can slice that array and pass it further."
8109440,8112480," That is very cool, I think."
8112480,8116160," That is actually very freaking cool."
8117120,8120400," So, let me, let me try to do that."
8120400,8126160," So, essentially, we have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6."
8126160,8128080," Here's the interesting thing."
8128080,8129520," This is one of the things to remember."
8129520,8135040," Since this algorithm works on constantly splitting by two,"
8136640,8140160," the input, the amount of samples always has to be power of two."
8140160,8146640," Because we want to be able to split perfectly in two on each individual iteration."
8146640,8148240," So, this is one of the important things."
8148240,8151840," And this is sort of like, as far as you know, one of the limitations of FFT."
8151840,8153760," DFT doesn't really have that limitation."
8153760,8154000," Right?"
8154000,8156240," It doesn't really care how many samples you give it."
8156240,8157520," It's just like iterates for all of them."
8157520,8158240," It's fine."
8158240,8161200," But for FFT to work, I think you must have"
8161200,8163920," power of two size of samples."
8164800,8166960," Does anybody know if I'm wrong?"
8166960,8170560," So, is there like FFTs that doesn't require that?"
8170560,8177840," Maybe they have some special cases for like handling the odd amount of samples."
8177840,8178880," But I don't really see that."
8178880,8183040," I think it heavily relies on having, on being able to split them in half"
8183040,8185760," for them to be even on each step."
8185760,8186800," Yeah, it must be power of two."
8186800,8187040," Okay."
8187040,8189600," So, I think it's like very crucial."
8189600,8193920," And this is basically the cost you pay for the speed."
8194560,8195200," Right?"
8195200,8196400," Because in DFT, it's slow."
8196400,8198160," But you can do that with any amount of samples."
8198160,8198400," Right?"
8198400,8200800," You can put seven samples in there and it will be fine."
8200800,8206640," Okay."
8206640,8209360," So, yeah."
8209360,8212960," Now, let's go ahead and do that."
8212960,8217840," So, how can we like keep all of the events in one place?"
8219760,8223200," So, essentially, I can basically iterate."
8223200,8228000," All right."
8228000,8232960," So, chat suggests to use the stride instead, which is rather an interesting idea."
8232960,8234880," So, let's give it a try."
8234880,8236800," Right."
8236800,8238560," So, this is basically a stride."
8239600,8242160," And it's kind of what we do in Python version anyway."
8242160,8243440," Right?"
8243440,8244160," Don't we?"
8244160,8244880," I think we do."
8244880,8245920," Kind of."
8245920,8249440," And essentially, right."
8249440,8250640," So, we want to do FFT."
8250640,8252880," Right."
8252880,8265280," We supply N and we provide like, yeah, we provide this stride plus one, I suppose."
8265280,8265440," Right?"
8265440,8270400," Because initially, when we call to FFT, we're going to provide stride one."
8271120,8271600," Out."
8271600,8273040," And that's what we're going to do."
8273040,8274160," We're going to provide stride one."
8274160,8277200," So, then we do FFT stride."
8277200,8278320," And Out."
8278320,8282000," I suppose Out is going to be the original thing."
8282000,8284320," But N is going to be divided by two."
8284320,8284560," Right?"
8284560,8286960," Because we have less elements in there."
8286960,8288560," So, and this is going to be odd."
8288560,8289520," Right?"
8289520,8290560," So, this is odd."
8290560,8293680," Yeah."
8293680,8294320," It's actually even."
8294320,8295200," I'm sorry."
8295200,8296400," It's actually even."
8296400,8298960," We can even do something like float even in."
8298960,8300640," Right?"
8300640,8301760," So, it's going to be a pointer."
8301760,8304240," And that's how we compute this entire thing."
8304240,8308560," And then we, if we want to compute odd, we just do plus one."
8308560,8311760," We just do plus one."
8311760,8316160," Though, by the way, in terms of stride, I think the stride has to be actually multiplied by two."
8316160,8317680," Right?"
8317680,8319440," I think it has to be multiplied by two."
8319440,8324800," And this one has to be not just plus one, but actually plus one stride."
8326080,8326560," Yo."
8326560,8328960," All right."
8328960,8332240," So, this one is going to be multiplied by two."
8332240,8336160," And after that, this is odd."
8336160,8340560," So, accessing this thing with a stride is a little bit more difficult because we have to,"
8340560,8344240," yeah, we have to multiply index by stride all the times."
8344240,8344480," Right?"
8344480,8347760," So, this is kind of, kind of difficult."
8347760,8352320," So, all right."
8354880,8359440," We have to, we still need additional memory somewhere."
8359440,8367280," We still need additional memory somewhere."
8367280,8369520," So, let me, let me think how we can do that."
8369520,8373360," And by the way, out has to be plus m2."
8373360,8376880," Right, because we're saving into, into the opposite things."
8376880,8379040," All right."
8379040,8388880," So, all are going to be the same effectively, don't they?"
8388880,8392960," All they're going to be the same."
8393520,8397360," This is like, can we do that without an additional memory?"
8397360,8399200," Can we do that without an additional memory?"
8399200,8403440," I feel like it's kind of hard to do that without an additional memory."
8405360,8410320," Because after we are done with odds, right?"
8410320,8414720," We have to iterate with halves."
8414720,8417200," We have to iterate halves."
8417200,8418400," So, this is going to be size t."
8418400,8422000," And n, 2."
8422000,8426640," And we have to take, so let me actually do something like this."
8426640,8428480," Oh my god."
8428480,8434160," I really hate when interfaces start, like, adapting like that."
8434160,8434880," It's so annoying."
8434880,8435120," Okay."
8438720,8440720," So, we take the odd."
8440720,8441600," And odd."
8441600,8442320," Let's use k."
8442320,8444640," So, it's the same, right?"
8444640,8445600," Let's use k."
8445600,8446960," So, it's the same k."
8446960,8448160," Multiply by stride."
8448160,8449840," All right."
8449840,8450960," So, this is what we have."
8450960,8452240," So, multiply by stride."
8452240,8456320," And we have to do cxp."
8456320,8460320," 2 multiplied by i, pi."
8460320,8464720," And k divided by n."
8464720,8468080," But here, we have to actually do float."
8468080,8472080," So, I would like to maybe switch it out to t."
8472080,8473040," All right."
8473040,8475200," Yeah, I would like to switch it out to t."
8475200,8481920," And this is going to be float t."
8481920,8484640," There we go."
8484640,8485840," So, but we need to..."
8485840,8494000," That one is interesting."
8497520,8498880," We kind of need to save that."
8498880,8503040," But we don't really have to."
8503040,8506000," Like, it's only Python that uses intermediate thing."
8506000,8511360," We can save that stuff into intermediate variable."
8511360,8513840," Like so."
8513840,8516480," All right."
8518560,8520880," And then we're iterating evens."
8520880,8522800," With..."
8522800,8523040," Yeah."
8523040,8525120," So, we are iterating them with the same k."
8525120,8526320," Right."
8526320,8528000," We're iterating them with the same k."
8528000,8528800," So, we can do..."
8532400,8533440," So, the out..."
8533440,8533440," So, the out..."
8533440,8539840," K is equal to even."
8539840,8543360," K is tried."
8551360,8555680," So, interestingly enough is that we have..."
8555680,8558720," In out, we have first have events."
8558720,8563040," And the second have odds."
8563040,8566640," But now, we have to combine them in a certain way."
8567440,8573760," Minus odd exponents."
8573760,8576800," Minus odd exponents."
8576800,8578480," And this one has to be e."
8578480,8582400," Plus odd exponents."
8584880,8585280," uh-huh."
8585280,8593120," So, that means that out k plus n2."
8593120,8596240," So, this is the value."
8596240,8603040," So, that means we can essentially sort of like swap n out."
8603040,8605280," All right."
8605280,8607040," So, this is what we originally have."
8607040,8609920," This is what we originally have."
8609920,8615760," We can take O on each iteration."
8615760,8618160," We're iterating these things by pairs."
8618160,8619840," We're iterating these things by pairs."
8619840,8622880," And essentially, we can compute V."
8622880,8626480," O of x."
8626480,8628480," And after that..."
8628480,8631840," After that, we can take E."
8634880,8635280," Uh-huh."
8635280,8637760," But we also need to save that E."
8637760,8638880," Right."
8638880,8640320," We can compute this thing."
8640320,8643440," And then, we can take E."
8643440,8646080," Which is original thing in here."
8646080,8648640," And..."
8648640,8651280," Original thing in here."
8651280,8654000," And essentially..."
8654000,8656880," K is gonna be..."
8656880,8659600," Plus..."
8659600,8662800," Maybe even..."
8664880,8665440," B..."
8665440,8669680," So, there's no stride in here."
8669680,8672320," E..."
8672320,8675440," Plus..."
8675440,8675600," B."
8675600,8682080," I got it."
8682080,8685600," So, we end up with pretty..."
8685600,8687760," complicated situation."
8687760,8689360," Right."
8690960,8692080," We have this thing."
8692080,8693040," We have this thing."
8693040,8695120," And then, we have to end up with the arrays."
8695120,8697520," Where each element here is..."
8697520,8697920," Plus..."
8697920,8699680," O of x."
8699680,8701360," And this one is..."
8701360,8702960," Minus..."
8702960,8703840," O of x."
8703840,8706160," And we can only iterate them by pairs."
8706160,8708560," So, we have to do that very carefully."
8708560,8709680," So, not to lose..."
8709680,8711680," Any of the information."
8711680,8713120," So, we're just doing this thing."
8713120,8714960," So, we take O and we compute that..."
8716000,8716880," Specific value."
8716880,8720880," But then, we also remember the previous value in here."
8720880,8722880," And then, we just reassign this stuff like that."
8722880,8726080," Yes."
8726080,8726720," I think..."
8726720,8729520," Because we're doing everything in place."
8729520,8732720," We're doing everything in place."
8732720,8739360," So, and maybe that is going to actually create what we want."
8740400,8742000," Is it going to create what we want?"
8742000,8743840," I don't know."
8743840,8745120," Let's find out."
8745120,8749440," So, we have some choice."
8749440,8751200," We have some choice."
8751200,8754960," So, we're going to start..."
8754960,8756320," First use DFT."
8756320,8758000," We're going to first use DFT."
8761520,8768400," So, this is N."
8768400,8772480," Let's see if it's going to come up with the right thing."
8772480,8774000," So, stride..."
8774000,8776800," Multiply by two."
8776800,8778640," They're supposed to be multiply by two."
8778640,8782720," Though, to be fair, these things are useless, right?"
8782720,8783760," So, we're not going to be using them."
8783760,8786400," Because we know that the output is in the first..."
8786400,8789600," Events are in the first half of the output."
8789600,8791040," An odd R in the second half."
8791040,8797040," It's like a merge sort."
8797040,8800400," It's like a freaking merge sort."
8800400,8804400," And the only thing here we don't take into account is when N is"
8804400,8810320," less or equal than 1."
8810320,8812720," To be fair, it should not be less than 1, right?"
8812720,8820400," So, we can always say that assert N equal greater than 0."
8820400,8823520," If N equal to 1."
8823520,8829360," One of the things, by the way, we have to do in here is out 0 equal N 0."
8829360,8830160," So, that's important."
8830160,8832480," So, we have to copy that thing."
8832480,8833760," And after that, it's just returned."
8833760,8839440," Yo, this mother flipper is surprisingly simple."
8839440,8841600," It's as simple as this thing."
8841600,8847840," We don't even use the stride."
8847840,8848800," How does it work out?"
8848800,8849360," Wait a second."
8854720,8856560," The only reason it works..."
8856560,8860240," We barely use stride within the computation..."
8860240,8863680," This is so cool."
8863680,8866400," We barely use stride within the computation of the indices."
8866400,8869280," It's only needed to do this quick offsets."
8869280,8873280," And the actual setting of the values is happening in here."
8873280,8885920," What the fuck, dude?"
8885920,8886640," Okay, anyway."
8886640,8888080," So, let's actually test DFT."
8888080,8890800," So, assert or whatever."
8890800,8893680," Let's introduce that."
8893680,8896160," So, that looks reasonable to me, right?"
8896160,8897120," So, that looks reasonable."
8897120,8900640," This is precisely the frequency that we actually put in there."
8900640,8901520," It's one and two."
8901520,8903360," One and two."
8903360,8907920," One is cosine and two is sinus."
8907920,8910240," Cosinus and sinus."
8910240,8911200," I'm going to call them like that."
8911200,8915040," None of that."
8915040,8919040," Sine, cosine, sinus and cosinus."
8919040,8922800," All right."
8922800,8924400," So, anyway."
8927120,8931600," So, FFT."
8931600,8933440," Okay."
8933440,8935440," So, you have to provide the stride."
8935440,8937120," And the stride is going to be one."
8937120,8937760," All right."
8937760,8938800," The stride is going to be one."
8938800,8947680," Did I just become the master of FFT?"
8947680,8950000," FFT is nuts?"
8952000,8952640," FFT you."
8952640,8958000," Anyways."
8958000,8963600," Why is this so fucking simple?"
8963600,8965280," Okay."
8965280,8968080," Can I mix up more frequencies, please?"
8968080,8969920," Can I mix up a little bit more frequencies?"
8969920,8972560," So, how about some cosine?"
8972560,8973760," Yeah, but this time it's three."
8973760,8976400," So, it's going to be F."
8976400,8979600," And..."
8979600,8982160," Yeah, it kind of worked out."
8982160,8985360," We can even do like 16."
8985360,8987440," Oh, yeah."
8987440,8991760," And we can even do 64."
8991760,8996320," Yes, yes, yes, yes."
8996320,8997360," So, it still works out."
8997360,8999680," Surprisingly..."
8999680,9003920," Surprisingly, it works out."
9003920,9012640," These words are directly taken from Latin."
9012640,9013200," Yes."
9013200,9015360," Sine, cosine, sinus, cosinus."
9015360,9017280," It's just like Latin."
9017280,9020560," It's just like different people say it with different accents."
9021280,9023520," They all say it with their local accents."
9023520,9029440," So, everyone speaks Latin anyway."
9029440,9030240," It's just like..."
9030240,9031680," All of the languages are Latin."
9031680,9034080," But with different accents."
9034080,9041920," Alrighty."
9041920,9045440," So, we can try to compare the performance of this thing."
9045440,9049440," At which point the performance becomes unfucking bearable."
9049440,9054320," So, if I try to use 1024."
9054320,9056960," That's how fast FFT goes."
9056960,9063120," This is how fast it cranks that soldier boy."
9063120,9069200," So, but if we do DFT on..."
9069200,9072640," This doesn't even work."
9072640,9074240," So, let's actually copy paste this stuff."
9074240,9077520," So, this one is in the DFT."
9080240,9081360," Look at that choice."
9081360,9082640," Look at that choice."
9082640,9085120," What about 248?"
9085120,9089280," So, almost a second."
9089280,9093440," What about this?"
9093440,9096240," This is your DFT."
9096240,9098640," This is DFT."
9102720,9104320," This is FFT."
9104320,9107120," This is FFT."
9107120,9110880," This is DFT."
9110880,9114960," So, that's the difference between them."
9114960,9117840," Like this, that's how bad it is, right?"
9117840,9120400," So, naive approach is really, really bad."
9120400,9122960," So, we can multiply it by two even more."
9123440,9125040," So, if we take a look at this thing."
9125040,9126080," So, it's gonna..."
9126080,9127840," It's basically quadratic, right?"
9127840,9128960," So, it's N squared."
9128960,9131040," It is N squared."
9131040,9136000," So, eight seconds."
9136000,9138640," F of T."
9145920,9152320," So, that's basically how many repetitions there are in multiplying the sine waves."
9152320,9154080," Right?"
9154080,9156320," So, we were multiplying sine and cosine wave."
9156320,9159200," But in that process, there is a shit ton of repetition."
9159200,9161520," That's how many repetitions there is there."
9161520,9163360," So, if we just don't do..."
9163360,9165200," Don't repeat these computations."
9165200,9166400," We cut it down."
9166400,9167520," So, fucking..."
9167520,9170160," It's insane how significantly we cut it down."
9170160,9174960," I really recommend you to watch that very interesting video that I provided in there."
9174960,9175200," Right?"
9175200,9181520," Because they even give you historical context of this algorithm."
9181520,9182080," Right?"
9182080,9189040," Because if this algorithm would have been discovered earlier, a little bit earlier,"
9189040,9194160," maybe we wouldn't have as many nukes in the world as we have right now."
9194160,9195840," Right?"
9196400,9203520," Because that algorithm was important for essentially detecting underground nuclear explosions."
9203520,9203760," Right?"
9203760,9206240," Because you can have a seismometer."
9206240,9206640," Right?"
9206640,9209600," You can have a seismometer that just measures the frequencies."
9209600,9215360," And you can detect, you know, underground nukes by decomposing the frequencies"
9215360,9218640," and looking for specific frequencies of that detonation."
9218640,9224320," So, and being able to quickly do that and process a lot of data was very crucial of detecting all of that."
9225280,9229120," But unfortunately, it was discovered, you know, quick enough."
9229120,9230960," It was discovered by Gauss, but no."
9230960,9232960," Yeah, but then forgotten and rediscovered."
9232960,9233200," Yeah."
9233200,9240720," Maybe we would not have this network latency exactly."
9240720,9243600," So, it's actually kind of cool."
9243600,9246400," The historical context of this algorithm is actually really cool."
9250640,9251360," So, yeah."
9251360,9253280," So, here we have FFT."
9253280,9257680," So, people wanted to use that for detecting nukes."
9257680,9262640," We're going to be using that for essentially visualizing some use-acc."
9262640,9264400," Right?"
9264400,9266800," We're going to be using that for visualizing some use-acc."
9266800,9272080," So, interestingly enough, how, like, the only thing we care about is the amplitude."
9272880,9273360," Right."
9273360,9276000," So, what we can do in case of an amplitude?"
9276000,9278720," We can do some stupid shit."
9278720,9282880," We can just take a real and imaginary part and just take a maximum between them."
9282880,9283680," Right?"
9283680,9286720," Just take a maximum between them."
9286720,9299360," How does, what does the current visualizer work?"
9299360,9300400," I mean..."
9300400,9306640," So, it just displays the current wave."
9306640,9307920," It just displays the samples."
9310000,9321680," Anyways, so, let's go ahead and try to port this sort of stuff to our visualizer."
9321680,9322320," Right."
9322320,9324320," Let's see if we can do anything useful in there."
9324320,9328320," Let us see."
9328320,9329760," Let us see."
9329760,9334800," So, here is the implementation that we're going to be using here."
9338000,9340640," So, we need something like complex."
9340640,9346320," So, these are the samples."
9346320,9354800," Interestingly, maybe we need to introduce something else in here."
9354800,9360400," So, let's say we're going to call it frex."
9360400,9362800," So, and we want to have..."
9362800,9365040," Maybe one had it in..."
9365040,9366160," Maybe 64, right?"
9366160,9367680," So, let's not have too many of them."
9367680,9369520," Let's not have too many of them."
9369520,9371200," Let's have like 64 of these things."
9371200,9374240," And we're going to have just a float."
9374240,9375840," Right."
9375840,9378160," And it doesn't really matter."
9378160,9382160," So, the way we're going to handle all of this choice,"
9382160,9385360," the way we're going to handle all of this choice is essentially"
9386800,9395520," So, we're going to see if frames is greater or equal than the array length of the frequencies."
9395520,9399680," So, we might as well..."
9399680,9409600," Actually, let's just literally have complex out and inputs 64."
9410320,9411840," So, I'm going to do a very stupid thing."
9411840,9414000," So, we've got some frames in here, right?"
9414000,9414960," So, we've got some frames."
9414960,9422800," And maybe what we're going to do is just..."
9426560,9427440," Maybe even in..."
9427440,9428400," Maybe even in..."
9428400,9429280," You know what?"
9429280,9430400," I'm going to have n."
9430400,9434720," Let's find n 64."
9434720,9436320," And this is n."
9436320,9444160," So, and then frames is going to be equal exactly to n."
9444160,9448000," And we're going to iterate through all of these things."
9448000,9450480," We're going to be iterating through all of these things."
9451360,9453760," Do I still have that frame thingy?"
9453760,9457280," I think I should actually bring it back because I think it was useful."
9457280,9460640," Left, right."
9460640,9464080," Left, right."
9464080,9469600," Frames."
9469600,9473280," Know what?"
9474160,9483840," I think if frames is less than n, we're going to just exit."
9483840,9485440," We're going to ignore this kind of frame."
9485440,9489360," We're going to ignore this kind of frame."
9489360,9493360," So, and then what we're going to do?"
9493360,9496400," Maybe we're going to say frames"
9498720,9499680," buffer data."
9499680,9502480," Frames i."
9502480,9503440," Left."
9503440,9505920," We're going to take only left ear in here."
9505920,9506160," Right."
9506160,9507760," We're going to only take left ear."
9507760,9510000," And we just put it in here."
9510000,9514000," And then we instantly do FFT on this entire thing."
9514000,9516320," Right."
9516320,9520000," We instantly do an FFT on this entire stuff."
9520000,9521600," So, this is input."
9521600,9523760," Stride is going to be 1."
9523760,9525360," This is output."
9525920,9528320," And n is just n."
9528320,9529120," There we go."
9529120,9530720," So, we receive some data."
9530720,9533360," We just FFT on that thing."
9533360,9533600," Right."
9533600,9535920," So, maybe we can even have 128."
9535920,9536800," It doesn't really matter."
9536800,9537840," So, I think it's..."
9537840,9541040," I think even 256 would be enough."
9541040,9543600," We're going to cut off some of the stuff."
9543600,9544880," So, we're going to just ignore that."
9544880,9546080," Right."
9546080,9548000," We're going to quickly do FFT on this thing."
9548000,9549520," And we're good to go."
9549520,9553280," The only thing we need to do now is visualize this entire stuff."
9554960,9560720," So, but one of the things it would be nice to have, I think, is to have a maximum amplitude."
9560720,9562160," Right."
9562160,9565680," So, let me try to run this FFT thing."
9565680,9569120," Oh, it's a slow version right now."
9569120,9572400," So, let's actually switch back to the fast version because I kind of want to see it."
9573280,9575760," So, can we have like a very negative thing?"
9575760,9578160," Very negative amplitude."
9578160,9579600," I think we should be able to have that."
9579600,9581760," 32."
9581760,9586480," Of course, we want to rebuild this kind of stuff."
9586480,9588720," Yeah."
9588720,9593600," So, sometimes a thing is negative."
9593600,9596240," Sometimes the thing is very much negative."
9597360,9599280," And it's when there is like a cosine."
9599280,9604640," Is there any easy way to get the amplitude out of the complex number?"
9604640,9604880," Right."
9604880,9609120," So, if we take the Euler's formula."
9609120,9611200," If we take the Euler formula."
9611200,9613520," So, I X."
9613520,9616160," Cosine."
9616160,9616800," Cosine."
9616800,9617440," So, let me find."
9617440,9621120," Cosine X."
9621120,9625440," Plus I."
9625440,9627520," Sine X."
9627520,9629120," And these are like the values."
9629120,9629360," Right."
9629360,9630640," So, these are the values."
9630640,9633200," Absolute value."
9633200,9634400," But I wanted to go down."
9634400,9636560," I mean, we can do that."
9636560,9637120," I suppose."
9637120,9637520," Whatever."
9637520,9638320," Whatever."
9638320,9639520," We can do that."
9639520,9640640," So, let's do it max."
9640640,9644080," Let's do the max."
9644080,9648400," And essentially, after we did the FFT."
9648400,9652560," We're going to iterate this entire thing."
9652560,9656880," And we're going to get the value."
9656880,9657920," Which is basically."
9657920,9671360," So, it's kind of like X."
9671360,9674720," Maybe something like this."
9674720,9678960," Imaginary."
9679840,9680240," And."
9680240,9689040," If."
9689040,9693360," Let's call it max_amp."
9693360,9697760," If max_amp."
9697760,9707680," Max_amp is less than C."
9707680,9710080," And max_amp equals C."
9710080,9714320," I might as well actually reuse C twice."
9714320,9716400," There we go."
9716400,9725920," So, this is the max_amplitude."
9725920,9728000," And we're going to use that as a sort of like a reference."
9728000,9731280," Reference point here."
9731280,9735920," So, after that, we're going to be iterating through all of these things."
9735920,9738800," So, zero less M plus plus I."
9738800,9741840," And."
9741840,9745200," Essentially."
9745200,9747520," We know that it's always positive."
9747520,9747760," Right?"
9747760,9750800," So, we're going to just keep it in there."
9750800,9754000," We know that it's always positive."
9754800,9756640," So, and we need to do T."
9756640,9758640," And T is effectively."
9758640,9761680," That value."
9770480,9771120," We know what."
9771120,9772880," We know what."
9772880,9780640," I want to have some sort of a function that accepts the float complex."
9784240,9785840," And just gives me this choice."
9785840,9787360," So, you know what I mean?"
9787360,9791280," I kind of won't be able to do that."
9791280,9794320," So, float A."
9794320,9798080," Float B."
9800000,9805440," If A less than B return B."
9805440,9807760," Either way, return A."
9807760,9809040," Right?"
9809040,9810800," So, I want to have something like this."
9810800,9812240," But I don't know how to."
9812240,9813280," It's called amp."
9813280,9814560," Yeah, I think that's a good one."
9814560,9815280," Amplitude."
9816160,9824560," And essentially, I can just do amp of out I."
9824560,9832560," And if this one is bigger, I'll just do it like that."
9832560,9832880," All right."
9832880,9833360," So, finally."
9833360,9834960," I think I found what I want."
9834960,9835840," So, this is amp."
9835840,9838560," And we're good to go."
9842960,9848400," So, after that, I can take amp of the out I."
9848400,9850640," And divide it by max amp."
9850640,9851200," And that's all."
9851200,9854160," That's it."
9854160,9854960," That's it."
9854960,9855600," That's it."
9855600,9856720," So."
9856720,9860000," Okay."
9860000,9860480," That's cool."
9860480,9864000," So, let me try to do that."
9864000,9865200," Let me try to reveal that."
9865200,9867200," And let's go to this thing."
9867200,9868160," So, we don't have a pie."
9868160,9869440," We have a pie."
9869440,9870560," Let's actually have some pie."
9872320,9873440," So, f of t."
9873440,9879600," And this is a global pie."
9879600,9883360," I'm just going to put it in here."
9883360,9888240," So, we need to have a math library."
9888240,9889680," We need to have a math library."
9889680,9891520," So, out."
9891520,9893200," Oh, yeah."
9893200,9895520," This has to be just the complex number."
9895520,9897840," What else do we have in here?"
9897840,9898800," Fabs."
9898800,9905200," Oh, it's absf."
9905200,9906400," Is that which one?"
9906400,9907440," What?"
9907440,9916720," How is that argument of type double?"
9916720,9918240," Because the complete..."
9918240,9919520," What?"
9922720,9922960," What?"
9922960,9924080," Do?"
9924080,9925040," What?"
9925040,9927440," This is a flow..."
9927440,9932080," Or do I not know how to use the complex numbers?"
9932080,9933520," I think I don't."
9933520,9935440," See in my..."
9935440,9935680," Yeah."
9935680,9937520," I do not know how to use them, apparently."
9937520,9939600," Okay."
9942400,9942960," Now I know."
9942960,9945760," So, frame."
9945760,9947680," So, it should be working."
9947680,9949680," So, redefinition of frame."
9949680,9950960," So, do we already have frames?"
9950960,9952640," Where do we have frames?"
9952640,9953520," I didn't see frames."
9953520,9956080," Ah, shit."
9956080,9956400," Okay."
9958320,9959040," Fabs."
9959040,9964400," So, we take fs left."
9964400,9966160," All right."
9966160,9966960," We're almost there."
9966960,9970480," Cell width is divided by n."
9970480,9977120," Okay."
9977120,9978240," So, that's something."
9979600,9980640," So, yeah."
9980640,9985760," We're doing FFT on every chunk we receive from this thing."
9985760,9987760," On every chunk we receive from this thing."
9987760,9988000," Okay."
9988000,9990880," We can't see Scheisse in this mist."
9990880,9993120," Surprisingly."
9993120,9996640," That's very surprising, actually."
9996640,10000720," Okay."
10000720,10004160," Very, very okay, girl."
10004160,10007920," So, why the fuck would it be like that?"
10009520,10010480," Flash of red."
10010480,10012320," I didn't see anything."
10012320,10019520," So, that is very not poggers, in my opinion."
10019520,10022160," So, this is zero."
10022160,10027280," This is zero."
10027280,10034000," We should have at least something, I think."
10037200,10038480," We should have at least something."
10038480,10041120," But we literally have nothing."
10041120,10058880," So, what if I just use this thing?"
10058880,10066640," We need to rebuild this attack, I think."
10066640,10077600," We need to rebuild this attack, I think."
10077600,10081920," We need to rebuild this attack, I think."
10081920,10091360," Why it didn't work the way I expected it to work."
10091360,10095520," Why it didn't work the way I expected it to work."
10095520,10100880," Why it didn't work the way I expected it to work."
10100880,10102880," Why it didn't work the way I expected it to work."
10102880,10121840," So, because max amp, right, I am just looking for maximum."
10126640,10138240," I would expect it to work the way I expected it to work."
10138240,10139520," I would expect it to work the way I expected it to work."
10139520,10140480," I would expect it to work the way I expected it to work."
10140480,10142720," I would expect it to work the way I expected it to work."
10142720,10143920," I would expect it to work the way I expected it to work."
10143920,10145040," I would expect it to work the way I expected it to work."
10145040,10151440," So, and we can continue working on that further, right?"
10151440,10154880," Maybe we can attach more other things there."
10154880,10159920," Because you can take this value and you can actually animate however you want."
10159920,10173600," Maybe you can have some sort of scene and elements of the scene react only to specific frequencies."
10173600,10184880," But the frequencies are completely wrong."
10184880,10188160," Maybe, but they look cool."
10189920,10194800," So, people are suggesting a lot of things."
10194800,10199520," But you guys don't realize, I don't understand why this thing doesn't work."
10199520,10204560," So, oh."
10204560,10207680," Oh, I know why."
10207680,10209840," All right, that makes sense now."
10218560,10222000," So, essentially the problem was that I set the cell to one."
10222000,10223280," So, now at least I understand."
10223280,10225680," Right, because it's one."
10225680,10228800," And now we can see some stuff."
10228800,10233600," So, that's cool."
10233600,10234640," That's cool."
10243200,10243760," Hmm."
10243760,10243760," Hmm."
10243760,10253680," They're also probably wrong because we cut a lot of information."
10253680,10260400," It is mirrored currently."
10260400,10261200," Well, yeah."
10261200,10264960," Because I think that's how FFT works."
10266240,10269120," Because there's like redundant information only on the right part."
10269120,10271840," So, I think you can just cut it in half."
10271840,10279520," If by wrong you mean that this thing should not be here, then yes, I guess."
10279520,10281120," It's not particularly useful for me."
10281120,10287360," So, by wrong you mean that there is duplication on the right side."
10288080,10290000," So, is that what you mean?"
10290000,10295440," Don't you FFT shift it?"
10295440,10296720," I don't know what is FFT shift."
10296720,10302160," What I know is that I can slap FFT on this thing and get some frequencies."
10302160,10303840," And that's what I did."
10312000,10313440," So, that's actually very cool."
10313440,10320800," So, the input data is only real."
10320800,10324000," If you had imaginary data as well, it would not be symmetrical."
10324000,10324960," That's an interesting thing."
10324960,10327840," How can we set..."
10327840,10330080," We can actually pretty easily set that."
10330080,10336240," I suppose we can just do..."
10336240,10338720," Like if we duplicate it."
10338720,10340640," Literally."
10342000,10345600," Something like this, right?"
10345600,10347440," Let's give it a try."
10347440,10350080," No."
10350080,10352160," That's probably not what you meant anyway."
10352160,10353520," But did I..."
10353520,10355040," I built."
10355040,10355920," Yeah, I did."
10355920,10356400," I built."
10356400,10363600," Though it does produce something."
10363600,10366720," It's kind of weird actually."
10372000,10373280," It's kind of weird."
10373280,10373760," It's kind of weird."
10373760,10374320," All right."
10374320,10383680," All right."
10383680,10386560," That's it for today."
10386560,10389120," Thanks everyone who's watching me right now."
10389120,10390640," I really appreciate that."
10390640,10392080," Have a good one."
10392080,10396160," And I see you all on the next recreational programming session."
10396160,10397200," Love you."
10397200,10398380," Mwah!"
10427200,10427700," you"
