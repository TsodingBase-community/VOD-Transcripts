0,11640," all right we're alive hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session"
11640,17220," so let's make a little bit of an announcement as usual and officially start the stream"
17220,27000," so it's going to be a red circle live on twitch right and what are we doing today"
27000,33680," we are implementing a ripple effect using openGL shaders that's right I've never done that before"
33680,39820," so it's probably going to go really horrible um so but I wanted to try that for quite some time"
39820,45820," already and I recently I stumbled upon a very simple article that actually explains it really"
45820,52520," well uh right it's just like a single formula and I just wanted to apply that formula and play with it"
52520,59400," on the stream so that's effectively what we're doing today so yeah that's basically the topic of"
59400,63920," today's stream so the article that I'm talking about is this one so I just like accidentally"
63920,69360," stumbled upon it and I thought that would be kind of cool topic for for today's stream right so I just"
69360,77140," like look at it and like saw how simple it is and uh thought I'm gonna just start the stream so this is"
77140,83680," going to be an exploration just a chill exploration stream so and effectively if you want to have uh like"
83680,90240," some sort of a ripple effect on um in like using openGL shaders on maybe webGL shaders webGL is basically"
90240,97360," openGL anyway it's just like a bindings uh like web bindings to openGL you just have to evaluate some"
97360,104020," uh so-called sombrero function uh which looks like sombrero I suppose yeah there we go so you're evaluating"
104020,110080," this sombrero function using the heights of this function to offset a texture to which you're applying"
110080,117860," the effect and you're gonna get the effect so yeah and I'm gonna be using my usual openGL template that I usually"
117860,125180," like develop on the streams uh so we can find it in here so I think I'm gonna copy paste this uh article in the chat"
125180,133460," for anyone uh who's uh who's uh who's watching right now all right so and maybe I'm going to actually do"
133460,142860," something like um you know I need to update my my project right so update cmd project um or"
142860,153740," one sender so I'm just gonna update the command uh so let me let me see so here is the project um"
153740,160740," so I'm making um a ripple effect using openGL shaders and I'm going to also attach this article"
160740,167560," in here so that's basically how I'm going to be uh operating today and for anyone who's watching the"
167560,172220," new job you can find that in the description and uh regarding the openGL template you can find the"
172220,179040," openGL template in here and I'm going to also put it in the description as well openGL template all right"
179040,184940," so uh yeah so it's kind of convoluted template I created it for myself keep that in mind if you"
184940,191220," decide for whatever reason to reuse it I don't think this template is reusable by anyone except me because"
191220,197400," I created it for myself but so I decided to share it anyway because why not there's no secrets in there"
197400,204200," so but just bear in mind that I did not put any sort of for usability into that template for anyone else"
204200,209700," except myself right so just keep that in mind if you decide to use it I suppose like I believe that"
209700,215120," everyone should create their own openGL template for their needs for their like style of development"
215120,222020," I didn't think there is like a like a single one size fits all uh except maybe in that case if if you"
222020,227540," come up with openGL template that like one size fits all you basically call it an engine right an"
227540,235100," engine is essentially an openGL template actually GPU API template that uh tries to fit as many uh use cases"
235100,240640," as possible right so but this is not what we're doing today we're have like very specific use cases and"
240640,247180," that's why I just keep it very simple very small and pretty much only for myself okay so I think I"
247180,255000," made some uh changes to the openGL templates so let me let me quickly find it uh on my machine it should"
255000,262360," be located somewhere here so openGL template there we go do we have any changes in here I think I have a"
262360,268240," separate branch for frame buffers and stuff like that so on one of the streams I've developing like a post"
268240,273660," processing essentially rendering the whole scene into a texture and then re-rendering that texture again"
273660,279620," so I can apply specific effects on that texture which could be useful today by the way we might as"
279620,286960," well actually apply uh ripple effect not just like to a single thing but to an entire screen like imagine"
286960,292760," a scene with moving object and on top of that a ripple effect that will be actually kind of cool to to"
292760,298360," explore so anyway um so did I fetch the everything I think I already did so I should have just like"
298360,304740," merged yeah so let's actually merge origin master uh so there's a couple of things in here that's"
304740,311340," there's a lot of things in here so yeah I haven't updated in a while but anyway so let's remove all of"
311340,315660," these branches in here that are not needed anymore and there's also this remote branch I think I also want"
315660,321720," remove it if it exists remotely I didn't know if it still exists there but yeah anyway I fetched with"
321720,326980," prune so that means if the branch was deleted the fetch would delete it as well locally but it didn't"
326980,332500," so that means it still exists um all right so let's try to rebuild everything so this is going to build"
332500,340400," posix um okay so the template is rebuilding hopefully okay and then we can try to run the template so this is"
340400,346280," how the template looks like it just like loads a texture from the uh from the file and just applies"
346280,351820," some sort of effects and whatnot there's nothing special it's just a template so I can grab it and"
351820,358300," start working with OpenGL without like re-implementing shit ton of like um you know boilerplate um you know"
358300,365700," every time so I'm going to put it in the corner so it doesn't you know uh doesn't bother anyone uh and"
365700,371400," we can start like changing things for instance we can try to change the texture that we're using right"
371400,377480," now uh so let's see what what kind of textures do we have we have sleeping texture I don't think a"
377480,384220," specific texture matters uh per se right so I'm gonna just keep the the regular texture in here so yeah"
384220,394480," hello hello everyone how are you guys doing so um yesu yesu yesu"
394480,406280," okay so let me see uh essentially what you have to do you have to evaluate this function which is"
406280,412600," basically some bearer function it's a sine of x over x uh but you have to do that into d"
412600,420620," uh right so below is a graph of a sine function following by a sink function uh right so let's take"
420620,427220," look so here is the sink function some bearer function so extending this to 2d we have uh r"
427220,435860," I suppose this is sort of like a radius uh so of x and y and z if we consider z sort of like a height"
435860,444860," is essentially oh okay oh I see what's going on so yeah to extend it to 2d we basically take 2d"
444860,452660," coordinates and we uh use it as a radius from a center where this entire thing uh happens okay"
452660,458000," that's actually very cool okay okay so that makes sense as you can see so r and then z is just that"
458000,464940," and then when you plot it you have this sort of like a pulse um to turn it into a ripple-like look"
464940,471120," in effect we just need to scale down the height of the function and animate it by adding time into this"
471120,476960," scene uh into the sign term to generate repeating pulses and we have like a simple shader in here"
476960,484680," uh which is super super nice all right so what we do here uh we take the coordinates of the pixel"
484680,490760," of the of the texture that we currently use to the rendering and then we divide it by resolution and"
490760,497960," essentially that maps the uh x and y uh coordinates of the texture from the screen coordinates i suppose uh"
497960,507400," zero uh zero uh 1920 to 1080 to just minus one one minus one one right so basically you have coordinates"
507400,515400," for minus one uh minus one and one minus one and one uh okay and then um we get the length of this"
515400,522360," sort of vector essentially so maybe i can even draw that uh just a second just a second"
522360,535800," maybe i just like need to draw all of that i'm doing that for the first time by the way so i like"
535800,540520," i literally stumbled upon this article and i decided that i'm not gonna go any further i'm just gonna"
540520,546520," stream how i look into that so just my first impression also i'm not a computer graphics uh person"
546520,553320," like i'm only learning right so uh this this stuff is kind of new for me right i know that there's"
553320,559080," like people like game engine people out there who's looking at my streams and thinking that i'm"
559080,564360," i'm an idiot which is true actually but it's just like uh you know all of that is uh for the first time"
564360,572360," for me uh all of that is the first time for me um so okay so essentially we have uh coordinates that"
572360,579240," start from here so this is zero suppose x and y uh and this is like probably is going to be full hd"
579240,588200," right to some extent uh 1080 right and then what we're doing we're just translating all of that into"
588200,594760," i think these coordinates right so this coordinate system because it's easier to apply mathematical"
594760,600120," function to that specific coordinate system so this is going to be one and this is going to be minus one"
600120,607960," this is going to be one and this is going to be minus one all right so after that uh right we node a"
607960,613080," particular point and we take the length of that point right in these specific coordinates and this is going"
613080,625880," to be our r uh right so this is c length and after that i suppose uh we're essentially just using it like"
625880,634600," yeah so we put it into cosine this time right and uh also offset it with uh with the time right we also"
634600,644040," have set it with the time and we multiply it by the position divided by uh length which i do not fully"
644040,654360," understand why we would do that but okay um right so the cosine will give us value from minus one to one"
654360,659640," right it will give us value from minus one to one uh and maybe this is not what we want maybe it's too"
659640,669400," much so we kind of like scale it down a little bit so this is the uh the actual position um i suppose"
669400,677400," this is normalization yeah this is normalization so this is sort of like a normalized vector um oh i see"
678680,685640," oh i see i see i see i see i see i see right so this is the height of the function right so this is"
685640,693480," the height of the specific functions uh somewhere here and uh then we take a normal vector vector in"
693480,703720," that direction of size one and we multiply it by that height making some sort of an offset and we apply that"
703720,711080," of set to the uh to the texture coordinate right to the texture coordinate and then we're just getting"
711080,717000," that texture and we use the color of this entire thing if that makes any sense does that make any sense"
718440,729000," um does anyone have any questions about what we're doing right now is is everything fine uh because"
729000,735080," everyone seems to be dead right now i'm not really sure why is that because it's like a boring for nerds"
735960,744280," uh so i guess that's that's true but that's the stream for you anyway so uh let's go ahead and just"
744280,749320," uh maybe look at some stuff so do i want to create like a separate shader for this entire thing so there"
749320,757480," is a shader that applies uh sort of uh just this ramboish effect maybe i want to kind of like replace"
757480,763960," it with uh with the ripple all right so it's going to be a ripple frag uh here's the ripple frag and"
763960,771640," i'm going to go into the renderer and use the uh ripple effect in here right so this is the ripple effect"
771640,776200," and i'm going to just refresh everything so everything seems to be fine and i'm going to go into the ripple"
778200,793320," right okay so um let me maybe copy paste this entire thing i don't really want to copy paste it but i"
793320,800680," can copy paste it in a separate uh in a separate branch uh not branch but window right so it's going"
800680,810200," to be glsl mode and we're going to put it like this um so we've got a sub azura akumori thank you so much"
810200,816280," for four months of twitch from subscription uh thank you thank you thank you and welcome back to our epic"
816280,825560," open jail club how about that uh thank you thank you thank you um all right so let me let me see so right"
825560,830600," now if i just remove this rainbowish effect right so as you can see there is just like a regular"
830600,837400," texture without any rainbowish effect uh the next thing i need to do i need to take the uh frag coordinates"
837400,845720," right x y and then resolution and that will give me the sort of uv coordinates and i don't think i need"
845720,853000," this stuff if you know what i mean right because i already have uv coordinates right i can just like"
853000,859560," directly use uv uh but what's interesting about that is that i still will need to convert them to the minus"
859560,865880," one one one two normalized device coordinates right so it's going to be something like this all right"
865880,872360," and we're going to call this uh c pause right so we're going to follow the conventions established in"
872360,881400," that file okay everything's fine uh in which language this this is jlsl um so i also use c"
883160,888200," um i don't know it's just like is the language really important apparently language is really"
888200,895400," important for people i'm going to put c in the title um okay i don't know why language is so freaking"
895400,899960," important for people but like it you can do that in any language right there's so many bindings in open"
899960,908920," gl it's like the language is not the point uh anyway whatever uh so here is the c pose and uh then we"
908920,916760," need to compute the length of that vector right so this is going to be c length uh right length c pose"
916760,925160," right so everything's fine uh and uh what we're doing in here so this is another uv coordinates"
926040,933160," uh maybe maybe i'm going to just try to do this thing directly right i'm going to try to do it"
933160,943560," directly uh this is going to be uv right this is uv and i'm going to add uh cosine of c length"
944120,952360," right so you see they just uh defined a lot of um you know special coefficients coefficients in here"
952360,958120," right uh but i suppose they like tweak them manually uh right i want to just like do like a"
958120,963960," very dumb thing where i just like apply this stuff and see how bad the entire effect looks like maybe"
963960,969240," it's going to look horrible maybe not uh i don't know so and maybe we'll have to apply these coefficients"
969240,977320," in there so i just want to understand the purpose of these coefficients coefficients i hope i pronounced"
977320,983880," them correctly i'm not sure if i do all right so let me put this stuff in here and let's see how horrible"
983880,989800," it's going to look like uh that's very interesting actually that is very very interesting"
993320,999400," so i suppose we'll still have to multiply it by some sort of normalized factor so it's like yeah"
999400,1008840," it looks really funny actually uh it looks really funny but yeah um so uh to to to"
1008840,1016440," i'm thinking i'm thinking i'm thinking i'm thinking do i just want to go ahead and do c pose"
1017160,1025560," uh see length right and just like multiply it by that and that should probably give me and it didn't"
1025560,1030920," give me anything at all and but but it compiled actually successfully that's what's interesting about"
1030920,1041160," that uh so i'm not sure what's up with uv coordinates what's up with uv coordinates do i want to do uv"
1041160,1048040," coordinates like this or because i pass my own uv coordinates that's the that's the thing i pass my"
1048040,1055080," own one um and i don't really want to recalculate those things um yet again but but i can try to do"
1055080,1062760," that why not so gl frag coordinate xy divided by resolution xy do you even have a resolution yes i do"
1063640,1072920," um all right so and in here i'll have to do it like that all right so let me try to do that no it's"
1072920,1080760," it's still like that it is in fact still like that and uh i can try to maybe start like subtracting time"
1080760,1090040," uh just to see how it's oh oh i see that is so cool so it's just like it didn't okay"
1093640,1105320," it's not like necessarily like a ripple effect all right it's just like but it's kind of rippleish"
1105320,1116200," kind of all right uh okay so that's that's pretty cool so and i suppose to like make it look all right"
1116200,1121480," you need all of these uh coordinates and and by the way since i know what was the problem can i just like"
1121480,1128520," go ahead and uh replace this uv with my own uv's uh apparently i can okay so i can just like use the"
1128520,1135720," the regular uvs in here so it doesn't really change that much cool uh so now um i'm gonna multiply by"
1135720,1141400," these coefficients that they suggest to use uh i'm not really sure if they're super important but they"
1141400,1147320," will change something okay so they are in fact changing something and then we're gonna just shrink"
1147320,1150920," this stuff a little bit and there we go we have a ripple effect"
1150920,1161000," that is very cool so i wanna like actually put this thing upside down a little bit right"
1161000,1175480," uh so vec2 tex uh uv right so this is basically tex uv and then uh i'm gonna do back to tex uvx tex uh uv"
1175480,1187080," uh uv y um so uh minus one so it's just gonna be upside down there we go so that's very cool"
1187080,1193720," i really like that look at that"
1199400,1207640," yeah yeah i suppose you can actually do like all sorts of kind of different warps uh by just like"
1207640,1218600," offsetting the uh yeah but by basically offsetting the the pixels of the texture by a height of a"
1218600,1225640," certain function um by height of a certain function and uh in this case we're just like applying the"
1225640,1231800," sombrero function right so this is the sombrero function um right and the higher the function"
1231800,1239960," in a particular point the like more we offset uh right the more we have set from the center right and"
1239960,1245720," that what creates this sort of like effect i wonder what are the interesting functions we can try to apply"
1247160,1249720," uh right uh what kind of interesting other functions"
1249720,1256520," so as far as i know we can like just take a look at the wikipedia and and just see"
1256520,1266520," um right i wonder if i can uh actually move my stuff in here right so i'm gonna move all of that stuff in"
1266520,1276840," here uh right uh well it kind of worked right because i want to be able to just keep that in uh"
1276840,1284360," you know in a view uh and then just like go around in here uh so just a second so here is a sombrero"
1284360,1298200," function right so sombrero function is there anything any other interesting uh functions that we can have"
1298200,1308600," a sync uh sync function to do to do to do to it'll be nice to like have like a catalog of different 2d"
1308600,1327640," functions that we can apply interestingly enough"
1327640,1337800," is this really oh this is not a normalized function they they make it look like uh"
1337800,1341720," we're normalizing this vector in fact we're not normalizing this vector"
1341720,1349240," we're just like applying the function cosine of c length divided by c length so that's basically"
1349240,1353320," what we're doing in here okay uh that is that is totally fine"
1353320,1366200," okay so we are applying this um sort of effect only um on the main scene only on the quad in the main scene"
1367000,1371800," uh in fact in this particular template we have two uh sort of stage like"
1371800,1377560," two phases of rendering first we render the scene with all of the polygons right now there's only two"
1377560,1383240," triangles in here right with all of the polygons we render all of that into the texture and then"
1383240,1388600," we are rendering that texture again on the bigger quad and we do that so we can apply more different"
1388600,1394760," effects in in the post-processing of this scene right so right now this is not done in the post-processing i"
1394760,1400360," would like to have like a lot of like different objects moving around and then globally apply this"
1400360,1406520," uh rippling effect there i think that will be interesting um i think that would be interesting"
1406520,1413160," so let's actually go ahead and try to do that first we need to actually see that we have uh you know"
1413960,1419880," something something something on the scene so let me make this entire thing a little bit smaller i'm"
1419880,1426040," gonna go into the main function and i need to find the quad that we're applying here so here's the quad"
1426040,1432280," and we always supply the quad of the entire size of the screen which is probably not what we want to do"
1432280,1438760," so let me apply the quad uh at the position of the mouse right so this is going to be something like"
1438760,1447400," that so x position and uh y position right and then uh we're gonna do something like this so let's say"
1447400,1451720," that the size of the quad is going to be 100. unfortunately i will have to restart the whole"
1451720,1459560," application because i can't hold to reload the c code and that didn't really work uh surprisingly at all"
1459560,1470680," uh so that is kind of sus not gonna lie um so why it didn't work uh this is because i didn't actually"
1470680,1475640," rebuild anything all right so this is going to be built posix and let's restart the entire thing"
1475640,1483320," and as you can see this entire thing is actually way smaller and it's actually following my um my cursor"
1485640,1492040," so it is in fact following my cursor that's actually interesting uh so that actually kind of confirms"
1492040,1499320," that the entire effect is not applied like globally to the entire scene so maybe it would be nice to"
1499320,1509000," uh i don't know um make this thing follow uh but not like being attached to the mouse so essentially like"
1509000,1520840," fall slowly um right fall slowly um so this is going to be something like that uh so we're going to have"
1520840,1528760," a position uh of the of the of the texture so this is the position of the texture and that's what we're"
1528760,1537160," going to use in here so this is going to be x and y and we're going to have like a velocity of the texture"
1537160,1542120," right so this is going to be something like this so position and the velocity of the texture"
1542120,1547320," on each step so this is where we compute everything on each step i'm going to be"
1547320,1552120," essentially applying uh the velocity of this entire thing multiplied by delta time"
1552120,1560680," right so multiply by data time this one is just x and y uh all right and then i think i will have to"
1560680,1567320," constantly recalculate the velocity depending on the distance of the current position from the mouse or"
1567320,1576200," something like that right so this is what we can do um x position minus x right so and let's say that"
1576200,1580760," this is going to be the velocity so it would be also nice to maybe multiply it by some sort of a factor"
1581640,1584920," at some point but it can be done later okay"
1584920,1593480," all right so as you can see it is following the uh the mouse right so and it's funny that it's funny how"
1593480,1601480," like the um further away it is the faster it is following so i think that's that's pretty cool uh we"
1601480,1608120," can make it actually follow um you know a bit faster so twice as much right so i can follow twice as much"
1608120,1610520," so"
1610520,1614040," it's actually pretty cool"
1614040,1624360," uh we can probably make it some sort of like a con constant uh right so basically uh follow"
1627320,1634680," follow scale right some sort of follow scale and maybe we can put it into the configuration file that"
1634680,1638360," will be actually kind of interesting can we put that in a configuration file i think we should be able"
1638360,1646440," to so in a configuration file uh like render.conf we have like different um configuration variables like"
1646440,1651640," shaders like vertex and fragment shaders the texture that we're currently using and we might as well just"
1651640,1658040," like introduce the uh the follow scale right so how quickly you're you're following so in here we're"
1658040,1665320," going to just have two or maybe something else uh reload uh render.conf all right so we are reloading"
1665320,1672440," render.conf and somewhere here we can just do something like uh if we encountered if we encountered something"
1672440,1680520," like as we equal key uh like follow scale right if we encounter that uh we're probably going to use"
1680520,1688840," something like str2f right is that a function that we can have str2f uh all right so here is the function"
1688840,1695960," so and i'll have to provide the uh value data and here i can just put no it doesn't really matter"
1695960,1704680," follow scale right so this is the foil scale and then uh i can put like a follow scale somewhere here"
1704680,1712440," float float for low scale and it's going to be essentially initially like zero and here maybe"
1712440,1719240," i'm going to also make it static uh right so it's going to be i uh and there we go so every time i"
1719240,1725320," want to change that uh that scale i won't have to um essentially reload the entire application i'll only"
1725320,1731560," have to like change the configuration file so it says that it's unused which is rather strange um yeah because"
1731560,1739800," i need it i see so that's pretty cool uh let me maybe experiment with this entire thing so i'm going"
1739800,1747560," to make it a little bit uh bigger so and i'm going to go to the render uh right and in here i can just"
1747560,1753400," change it to zero five and now this thing is going to be following it very very slowly as you can see it"
1753400,1759320," is following uh very very slowly but at any point i can say okay so the coefficient is going to be five so"
1759320,1764920," it's going to follow it super super fast so as you can see i can now adjust this parameter uh like just"
1764920,1774440," just like that uh should be relatively easy so i think five is all right maybe right maybe it is all right"
1774440,1783560," uh it will be kind of nice to have more objects in here like as i apply more effects uh if you know what i mean"
1783560,1790600," right uh so maybe we're gonna have a second object that follows that this first object uh but we don't"
1790600,1796520," want to like follow it the same way as it follows the mouse because they basically gonna snap to the same"
1796520,1802920," uh exact position so maybe they're gonna try to stay like a certain distance from each other right so if"
1802920,1807960," there is a second object somewhere in a different place it's gonna follow that first object but only up"
1807960,1814360," until it uh you know reaches a certain like distance towards that object if that makes any sense"
1814360,1817960," all right so we can try to do something like that that makes sense"
1831480,1837400," all righty so uh we've got some subs i'm really sorry that i missed them uh ampersands are cool uh"
1837400,1842280," thank you so much for a tier one subscription your first subscription by the way and welcome to our epic"
1842280,1847960," open gl club about that that's right we're doing open gl on this channel did you know that"
1847960,1855160," did you freaking know that uh also maybe i would like to have this size of the objects also in the"
1855160,1861560," configuration file uh i accidentally closed the chat by the way which is probably a good thing but not"
1861560,1870360," right now right so um okay so let's say something like uh object size right so and right now the object"
1870360,1880200," size is 100 uh all right so if i find 100 i can say something like object uh size object size follow"
1881160,1893320," scale static float or object size 100 and uh somewhere here we're going to have object size the same way"
1893320,1899560," there we go should be fine okay"
1899560,1909160," so and now i can just experiment with the object size uh there we go so it could be small it could be even"
1909160,1914440," smaller right so it could be something like that so this is a very small object or it could be super big"
1914440,1920520," like thousand of those things and it's going to be like right into your face uh right so let's take a"
1920520,1927000," look so this is this is how big it is right now right and all that is like now controllable in here which"
1927000,1934200," is fine so i think around 50 uh was a pretty good size for this object uh if it's so small i would like to"
1934200,1940920," also like move a little bit faster like around seven uh right so i think i think it looks actually very"
1940920,1950360," nice i think it looks pretty pretty nice so all of those things are now configurable we can uh we can"
1950360,1956200," play with them but maybe for now while i'm like you know doing some other stuff i'm going to just do"
1957080,1961880," something like this right so let's just let it sit in here uh while i'm doing the other thing"
1961880,1972280," so uh we're starting to have uh more objects how can we add the second object right uh the second"
1972280,1982040," object that is like keeps moving uh that keeps moving uh all right so this is x y and dx dy so maybe it"
1982040,1988920," makes sense to actually abstract out these four uh floats into some sort of a structure and call it"
1988920,1995000," an object uh of some sort but i i don't know uh how are we gonna call that uh we can call just a face"
1995000,2002920," because this is basically a face right the face that is just like keep following you uh right so let me see"
2003640,2016200," uh so this is going to be type def struct uh face this is the face and um float x y dx dy"
2016200,2021960," and what other things we need to have in here i suppose we need to be able to render"
2021960,2027720," uh that face on the screen so we need to have something like face render and it will accept the"
2027720,2034040," current like renderer with which we are rendering things and uh the pointer to the face right and"
2034040,2042920," it should be as simple as pushing the quad um so i forgot how to yeah there we go"
2042920,2054040," so in here we'll just do face x uh face y so we also pass the core but i don't think"
2054040,2061320," it's if it matters that much uh right though i don't like the name face let's actually do a code"
2061320,2076280," object uh right object render object object object object object right x and y so and another thing we"
2076280,2081560," need to be able to do we need to be able to update it uh each frame right with the delta time so it's going"
2081560,2094680," to be object update object object object float delta time so and in here i'm gonna just move the uh this"
2094680,2105640," thing right though i'm not sure if that's how i'm gonna do that i'm really not sure so i think for now"
2105640,2112040," i'm gonna just move that stuff in here like uh you know delta time moving the data time there we go"
2112040,2122600," now in here we're gonna have like a main object so this is object and this is main object and in here"
2122600,2132760," i'm gonna just zero initialize everything so it starts at zero then i'm just doing object render i provide"
2132760,2138520," the renderer and main object that is following the cursor and then in here um"
2138520,2150200," oh boy uh oh boy oh boy where is my site so i'll have to do something like object update"
2150200,2159160," so this is the main object and i have to provide the delta time right so but in here i'm basically"
2159160,2166360," computing the new velocity for the for the object that i'm following so i think maybe object update"
2166360,2173640," should also accept the target x and target y so then it would make it easier to chain the second"
2173640,2180360," object into the equation if that makes any sense right so that's probably we should try to do so i'm"
2180360,2187080," gonna go to object update and accept uh target x and target y right"
2187080,2201000," float target y um and in here i'm going to just grab the entire thing right move it in here uh and"
2201560,2211960," instead of x and y we're gonna have target x right so this is gonna be target x follow scale um so it"
2211960,2216680," should be probably called follow speed but doesn't matter um so in here i'll also have the prefix all"
2216680,2223960," of this stuff with like uh object um you know what i think i want to call it obg so i don't type too much"
2223960,2231160," right so i think object is like literally too much to type uh object that then another thing here is"
2231160,2239240," object that and this is another thing which is object that there we go can i recompile the entire stuff"
2239240,2245000," is it recompilable uh so okay let's take a look at the compilation error so like i literally renamed it to"
2245000,2253160," object i'm sorry uh i think i'm gonna need it uh so all right so and the following here is going to be"
2253160,2262760," x pose and y pose um all right x pose and y pose and everything seems to be okay all right that's fine"
2262760,2271640," cool cool cool cool cool so now we need to have the secondary object right uh so second object which is also"
2271640,2279560," going to be like like this um second object and i want to render the second object like this so this"
2279560,2289240," is a main one this is the second one and in here we are effectively updating the second object the delta"
2289240,2296600," time but we're following the main object right we're following the main object but to follow the main object"
2296600,2301480," we don't really want to follow the exact position of the main object if we try to do something like"
2301480,2309000," that so x uh they're just basically gonna snap uh together in in fact uh they already stay in the"
2309000,2317480," same position so it is kind of well there will be some sort of delay i think between them i think"
2317480,2323160," there will be some sort of a delay uh between them right so let's actually see let's actually confirm"
2323160,2329400," but at some point they're gonna like snap into the same position yeah yeah okay oh that's pretty cool"
2330120,2331800," look at that look at that look at them go"
2331800,2336680," it's pretty cool"
2336680,2345960," so and uh we can probably just like change the the size of those things like i originally wanted them to"
2345960,2359080," be 50 uh right so now uh yeah that's pretty cool so maybe maybe it's fine right so since there's still delay"
2359080,2365800," between them you see there's still delay between them and that's kind of fine all right that is kind of"
2365800,2371800," fine that there is a still delay between them so uh we can try to add the third object right we can try to"
2371800,2380840," add the third object um so this is going to be the third object and here is the third one and then we're"
2380840,2387720," going to be chaining the third object into the second one right so third object and this one is going to"
2387720,2396520," be the second one right and there we go so let me see is it going to recompile so there's three of them"
2396520,2401240," so we want to actually have like arbitrary amount of objects in here so i want to have some sort of like"
2401240,2407960," n that controls the amount of objects and actually chain them automatically if that makes any sense"
2407960,2411160," uh right so let's actually make them maybe a little bit bigger"
2412360,2422600," uh yeah so they are a little bit bigger now cool that looks so cool i really like that uh look at them go"
2427080,2442600," okay okay so uh let me let me see let me see i wonder what we can do in here um we can actually make it"
2442600,2450840," follow not the mouse for now but some sort of like a procedurally generated point right so let's actually"
2450840,2459080," make it follow something like sine uh of time sine of the current time and the cosine of the current"
2459080,2465560," time uh but the coordinates are screen coordinates so it's going to be kind of kind of lame if you know"
2465560,2479080," what i mean so i can multiply that by some sort of a radius uh all right radius uh radius and the radius"
2479080,2485400," in fact is going to be something maybe 100 right so and it's probably going to follow in the uh bottom"
2485400,2489960," left corner right but we want to do that in the center so that means we'll have to do a little bit of a"
2489960,2498600," translation for that one uh right oh no this they're already in the center that's actually pog that is"
2498600,2504040," actually super pog so i'm going to increase the radius to like 500 and i'm also going to increase the"
2504040,2513080," speed uh right so let's call it something like speed i think right float speed and maybe it's going to be"
2513080,2522440," around uh around something like this right yeah so now they're just like i like without me so they're"
2522440,2530280," just like moving around uh i'm not touching anything they're just like rotating hypnotizing you uh basically"
2530280,2537160," hypnotizing you um and what's funny is that we can now move these things into the uh into this into the"
2537160,2546760," the configuration as well right so we can call it like rotate um radius and rotate speed uh"
2546760,2556360," right so this is going to be a rotate speed and uh rotate radius and i'm gonna move that to the"
2556360,2563800," configuration in here a runtime configuration um right might as well just like take the entire thing"
2565400,2573880," uh rotate radius uh rotate radius and now uh float follow scale this one is going to be static float"
2573880,2583400," so rotate radius and it should be super easy to just add uh all this stuff in here so we can control it"
2583400,2593000," rotate radius and now rotate speed right this is rotate speed"
2595400,2603480," uh okay so that means i can put this stuff in here and for example now i can just see uh radius let's"
2603480,2611720," actually cut it in half right so i cut it in half now it looks like this what's interesting is it kind of"
2611720,2619320," goes to the new radius slowly right if i change it back to 1000 it's not gonna jump anywhere right it's just"
2619320,2628520," like slowly goes back that's so cool right oh that is so cool i like that oh my god so wait a second"
2628520,2636200," uh can i do something like that right so this is gonna be 5000 all right and i might as well call that"
2636200,2655320," uh and then uh around like 10. so cool uh we can make him maybe make it a little bit slower uh but it could be"
2655320,2664680," maybe around 10 i suppose right so with such a radius it's actually like not clear what exactly"
2664680,2677000," we're doing in here uh right maybe five and of course we can uh reduce the object size yeah so they're"
2677000,2688280," smaller they're a little bit smaller uh so that's pretty pogo that's pretty pogo so that's a pretty"
2688280,2691560," cool system right so you can just like dynamically reload all these things"
2691560,2700280," and to do so uh let me put this stuff somewhere here"
2702680,2707640," right let's just keep it in here uh while i'm working on the rest of the stuff because"
2707640,2713240," what i want to do right now i want to actually have several uh like basically variable amount of such"
2713240,2724280," objects right uh variable amount of such objects um to two so maybe follow scale is going to be like five"
2726840,2729080," and rotation speed maybe two"
2729080,2737640," so i don't want it to be like super annoying uh follow scale maybe like"
2737640,2743160," yes oh yeah yeah look at that that is way better now"
2743160,2748440," so i'm gonna just keep it like that"
2753640,2754920," what an absurd program"
2754920,2763720," it's not a program well i mean it's program by some definition uh so"
2763720,2780920," all right"
2784440,2788120," calling this a program is the same as calling a sketch a painting"
2788120,2796760," um all right let me now have an array of those things right so obviously we want to have an array"
2796760,2804280," of objects um so let's define something like uh objects uh capacity and how many of them do we want"
2804280,2809640," to have uh let's say we're gonna just pre-allocate like thousand of objects uh so we're gonna have an object"
2809640,2817240," and here is objects objects camp uh and how many of them do i want to have in here so i'm gonna say"
2817240,2824920," objects uh as z initially it's going to be zero but uh what we can do we can probably"
2828120,2835080," we can probably bind the amount of objects to um to the configuration right you know what i mean"
2835080,2841880," right so then i can change that uh from the configuration which is actually kind of cool"
2841880,2849000," right so that means i'll have to put that somewhere where we reload the configuration so this is going to"
2849000,2856360," be uh follow scale um so this is the render config uh let me put it somewhere here so that means that the"
2856360,2865880," definition of the object also has to be somewhere there right um which is fine i guess"
2868520,2888360," this is c um follow scale um so how should i call that object count maybe objects count so that's what"
2888360,2895960," we're gonna have and in here if i encounter something like this this is going to be objects count objects"
2895960,2907560," count uh and instead of str2f we have to use str2 i don't even know how is that called str2d not i"
2907560,2914280," str2i i think it's it's signed"
2914280,2922680," um str2u i think that's what i was thinking about this is the thing i was thinking about str2u"
2923400,2929960," and convert string to you and max ah ld i think that's what it's called the standard one is called"
2929960,2944520," str2l d right that's the standard one supposed to be no no ld man str2l yeah"
2947240,2958360," uh 2ll maybe yes that's what i wanted i think that's what i wanted i'm pretty sure uh no i'm"
2958360,2968360," gonna do what uh str so this is equal and here i'm gonna take the value data the end pointer i don't"
2968360,2973880," care about this so i'm gonna put moon here and for the base obviously we're gonna use 10 right obviously"
2973880,2983320," we're gonna use 10 another interesting thing is that um we need to uh check if it didn't overflow so"
2983320,2991080," essentially i can check if objects count is greater than objects uh capacity right so i think i will have"
2991080,2999560," to cap it to the object capacity so i think that's the easiest thing to do in here uh right uh and we"
2999560,3009320," might as well even print something on the screen right so s d ld so this is the the position within"
3009320,3018680," these uh within the configuration uh warning uh objects count overflow right objects count overflow"
3018680,3024760," and the position of this thing is somewhere here so we're just doing that so we cannot accidentally"
3024760,3034680," set a huge value and buffer overflow right uh we don't want to buffer overflow especially in c code right"
3034680,3043480," am i right arise developers am i right you don't want to buffer overflow uh okay so object size object"
3043480,3049960," size we don't have an object size so that means i'll have to define all of that before the configuration"
3049960,3058520," in here uh all right so i'll have to do it like that and uh all right so we have three of them okay"
3058520,3064440," that's fine this is because i didn't even um you know write roll the code that actually chains all"
3064440,3071320," these things together so let me go to the render render config and let's say that objects count is"
3071320,3079960," going to be for now three so we literally have three object counts um all right so this is three and this is"
3079960,3086600," fine okay now when i'm rendering all the objects we're not going to have even like main second third like"
3086600,3095880," it doesn't matter right we have several objects now so size t i less than uh objects count right plus plus i"
3095880,3104040," and we are rendering each an individual object in here so uh render r uh objects i right so that's what"
3104040,3111560," we're doing in here so i'm rendering all the available objects in here and uh then when i'm chaining things"
3111560,3117800," together i need to probably use the zeros object as the main object and then chain together the rest of the"
3117800,3122760," stuff so but i can't do that if i don't have enough objects so i'll probably have to check for something like"
3122760,3128600," objects count has to be greater than zero so we're going to be updating the objects only when they're greater than zero"
3129320,3137880," right so and now uh what i'm going to do i'm going to do object update object objects uh zero right"
3137880,3147400," delta time and i'm going to be using this follow point right so this is basically follow point"
3147400,3156360," and i'm going to just put it in here right so after that i need to start uh iterating through the rest of the"
3156360,3162680," objects we have right so it's going to be size i um probably starting from one because we already"
3162680,3168520," updated the object zero right so we already updated updated the object zero and we need to um you know"
3168520,3177240," work on the rest of them uh so this one is going to be objects count uh plus plus i and uh all right"
3177240,3184520," so this one is going to be essentially object one object i we're updating object i and we're making it"
3184520,3192600," follow the object i minus one position right so the next object follows uh the position of the previous"
3192600,3202200," one right so hopefully that will work uh so this is just object uh this is several of them uh right this"
3202200,3208760," is just several of them and uh we're gonna have several okay so we have three of them so now i can"
3208760,3216920," uh go ahead and put four in here and we have four of them we literally have four of them it's kind of"
3216920,3222920," difficult to see them so i think we need to uh increase the radius so let's actually do 500 uh so"
3222920,3228040," now we have a little bit of a radius so as you can see they're they're doing this uh little dance maybe"
3228040,3232680," they should follow each other a little bit faster right so now they're following each other a little bit"
3232680,3240680," faster what about adding the fifth object uh so here is the fifth object uh so now we can uh add up to i"
3240680,3247960," suppose 1000 we can try to add 100 and that's a lot of objects in here that's 100 objects and they're"
3247960,3259640," swirling around so 100 objects so we can make them just follow a tiny bit faster so they like detach from each"
3259640,3266200," other like a little bit so then unswirl if that makes any sense but yeah uh at any point i can"
3266200,3271880," just say okay let's have 10 of them so let's cut out the rest of them so this is going to be like five"
3271880,3279480," uh right around like five should be fine and uh yeah there we go though uh if we're gonna have"
3279480,3287240," a round of 100 of them right so this is 100 of them it would make sense to make them a little bit smaller"
3287880,3291560," right so yeah if we're gonna have a lot of them it makes sense to make them a little bit smaller"
3291560,3300520," um right so but that is only if we're following this like uh procedurally generated thing what if we"
3300520,3307000," bind it back into a mouse right so we can try to do that i'm gonna just close this entire thing"
3308200,3316360," uh so here i suppose it makes sense to maybe extract all of that thing to something like"
3316360,3325320," uh float follow x so we're following this thing um though i'm not even sure why why i'm using"
3325320,3333640," sine for x i i think historically x is cosine isn't it i think it is i think i confused them a little bit"
3333640,3342360," but that's fine i'm not a mathematician that's totally fine uh it works out anyway it works out"
3342360,3354280," anyway follow y right okay so and in here i just can command it out and then use uh x pose and x y so"
3354280,3363160," that way this entire like sort of uh fiesta is going to be following my mouse uh hopefully right there we go"
3363160,3369960," look at that they're following my mouse so they should be actually i think following a little bit faster"
3370520,3380280," so let's make it like 10 so um yeah 100 is too much so let's do 10"
3380280,3395560," so yeah that's pretty cool though we can make it even cooler what if we don't make it follow just the"
3395560,3402600," mouse but make it follow point that is rotating around our mouse so we made it rotate around the"
3402600,3410440," center but what if we made it rotate around the mouse a little bit right and we can use the same radius"
3410440,3417240," as before so we can combine both of these things so this one is going to be just essentially uh you know"
3417240,3426040," something like this uh okay so this is going to be plus and i can just like do it like that uh let's"
3426040,3433240," restart the entire thing and let me see so it is rotating around the mouse but the radius is too huge"
3433240,3438920," like it's rotating around a very huge radius so let's go back into the configuration and say that"
3438920,3444360," the radius is going to be 100 right so and they're following the mouse but they're rotating around the mouse"
3445400,3452840," right so it's very cool i really like that"
3452840,3468440," all right so uh and uh rotation speed we can also speed up the rotation speed right so they can rotate a"
3468440,3478840," bit faster uh right and we can have like more of them uh 20 so here are the rest of the objects"
3478840,3491160," okay this is so fun like i i don't know why but but isn't it fun that's the joy of programming by the"
3491160,3496600," way that's literally recreational programming people ask me all the time so why are you doing this why are you"
3496600,3502520," doing that what's the benefit are you gonna make money out of that like isn't that just fun isn't"
3502520,3510040," just farting around with computers freaking fun like i think people are forgetting how fun it is it's just"
3510040,3515320," like annoying seriously this is fun this is fun this is so fucking fun"
3515320,3526120," anyway so i'm sorry it's a little bit frustrating uh so object size and let's make it like 50 or something"
3529400,3534200," uh so rotation radius can you just make it like 300"
3534200,3548520," okay so the reason why i was doing all of that is because i wanted to have like some sort of moving"
3548520,3556920," object on a scene uh and when i switch the like because originally what we created right uh what"
3556920,3562680," we originally created so maybe i should stop like everything that's going on so i'm making everything"
3562680,3568680," super slow right so this is going to be around like one and then i'm going to make the uh textures really"
3568680,3578680," big um so that's not what i wanted all right so i wanted to make the size of the object like around 300"
3578680,3585880," maybe so as you can see originally what we did we applied the uh ripple effect on the texture"
3585880,3590600," right that's what we did but the ripple effect applied to each an individual object"
3590600,3597080," so what i want to do uh right i want to have some sort of like a dynamic scene and i want to apply a ripple"
3597080,3603880," effect in the post processing on the entire scene right you see so basically i want to detach that"
3603880,3609960," effect from specific objects and i want to apply that effect to like literally everything and moving"
3609960,3615160," objects are going to help like to have a point of reference to actually see what's going on"
3615160,3624760," uh to actually see what's going on right so that is uh that is going to be interesting um all right so"
3624760,3634440," let me move this stuff away i really like how it looks like uh okay so so maybe i'm gonna yeah the"
3634440,3640920," radius is kind of too big so let's actually make the radius 500 because otherwise it's not really"
3640920,3646440," visible what's going on uh oh this is object size uh"
3647880,3652760," right so let's keep object size like that and the radius has to be maybe it's fine"
3652760,3664680," okay it is fine um cool um just a sec just a sec just a sec all right"
3664680,3672680," so we have a shader in the post processing right we have a shader in the post processing and that shader in"
3672680,3678040," the post processing is responsible for actually uh creating the flash bang effect when i reload"
3678040,3685880," everything you see so every time i reload something it like creates this like flash bang effect uh and"
3685880,3693800," for instance if i made some sort of a mistake inside of the shader uh for instance in a ripple frag right"
3693800,3701560," so in a ripple frag uh if i get like semicolon it will uh flash with the red uh then i can reload it again"
3701560,3707960," and it will flash with green so this is entirely the purpose of this uh sort of like a post processing shader"
3707960,3714040," but i think it's kind of useless right i don't think it's that particularly useful i think i want to repurpose"
3714040,3723320," that post processing shader to actually apply the ripple effect instead that's what i want to do uh"
3723320,3730760," let me see how i can do that so i'm gonna literally go though i can't hold to reload the post processing"
3730760,3736600," shaders so i'll have to probably restart the whole application but that's fine um so we have a flash"
3736600,3742040," fragment right and this is what we're doing here so t is responsible for the current value of the flash"
3742600,3750280," um so that is fine um so where is my ripple so ripple frag"
3750280,3761480," so what i'm thinking is that i'm going to disable this entire thing right i'm going to disable just"
3761480,3767960," this entire thing and uh just apply this stuff like that so as you can see there's no ripple effect on"
3767960,3776360," individual textures anymore right as you can see there's just no ripple effect so there's too many objects"
3776360,3782280," let's actually make three of them or something um yeah cool"
3782280,3797160," um and i want to now go back to here right so i do have uv coordinates that's fine uh that is totally fine"
3797960,3808600," but i don't have the time in here uh uniform uniform um let's call it float time and when i'm"
3808600,3819320," synchronizing the uniforms for the flash flash sync uniforms right i think i also want to have a uniform"
3819320,3826360," uh responsible for the time so here is the texture uniform color uniform and the t uniform let's introduce"
3826360,3836840," gle int uh time uniform right time uniform uh t uniform okay so this one is going to be just time uniform"
3836840,3847320," uh-huh uh t uniform this is the only place where we update it right so flash sync um"
3848600,3856200," uniforms gl uniform one f uh uniforms is basically global variables that are visible to the shaders"
3856200,3862440," and shaders are programs that you run on your gpu right so just for for for anyone who just joined"
3862440,3866920," and doesn't understand what is opengl shaders and stuff like that right shaders are programs that run"
3866920,3874040," on your gpu right and uniforms are just like global variables that are visible to the to the shaders um"
3874040,3880360," right so and basically what i'm trying to do i'm trying to pass the current time to the shader so it"
3880360,3885560," can use that time to animate to uh create the animated ripple effect so that's essentially what's"
3885560,3892280," going on uh all right and the next thing we're gonna do is a time uniform right so i'm setting time"
3892280,3899400," uniform to the current time and i think the current time is currently like global variable literally so yeah"
3899400,3904600," i don't have to pass it anywhere so that's fine uh okay so let me let me see"
3904600,3919080," okay good so that's cool um that is very very interesting but i'm not sure if it's actually working"
3919080,3926520," i think in the post processing shader yeah okay so everything seems to be working uh if i try to"
3926520,3933720," do something like this it should not compile it should not start because yeah the the post processing"
3933720,3940920," shader does not compile as well it does not compile as well okay so that's cool uh now in the post processing"
3940920,3948120," i'm just gonna apply uh text uv all right i think it's gonna make everything upside down essentially"
3948120,3957720," right so and as you can see the ripple effect applied to the whole scene right so we can actually"
3957720,3963880," make uh more things on the scene so first of all let's make uh the objects a little bit smaller like 100"
3963880,3971400," and let's make uh 20 of them and let's make them move a little bit faster right so yeah as you can see"
3971400,3979960," now the ripple effect applied to the whole scene uh that's actually super cool all right so not an"
3979960,3986840," individual texture but uh the whole scene um yeah and this is because we have like a post processing uh"
3986840,3993000," like pipeline in here uh some sort of post processing pipeline um"
3993000,4003880," and it's achieved by rendering the whole scene into a texture and then rendering that texture with"
4003880,4010280," additional shader right so we have two shaders the first shader that just renders the uh original face"
4010280,4015320," and the second shader that is renders the ripple effect and what's funny is that we also have"
4016200,4023240," uh we use a ripple shader in here but if we use the original shader here uh it also applies like a"
4023240,4028760," rainbow effect on each individual thing in here so that's cool there's so many layers of effect in"
4028760,4036360," here look at that this is the beauty of open gel by the way right so you if you master it like i'm by"
4036360,4041720," no means actually mastered open gel but once you understand it you can layer effects upon each other"
4041720,4048360," like that so there's a separate effect of like uh that is applied on each individual object and then"
4048360,4052120," like a global effect and whatnot and that's what we have in here that's so cool"
4052120,4059640," uh right and it follows your mouse as well holy shit that is so cool"
4064600,4070440," we're gonna use like other textures by the way believe it or not uh right so let's actually put"
4070440,4078520," this stuff in here uh right and i wonder it kind of it kind of does not allow me to properly do all of"
4078520,4088600," that so okay um let me grab a poggers emote right so we're gonna have a poggers emote i'm gonna put it"
4088600,4097480," into the assets all right so i'm literally downloading it uh poggers i suppose it is png right it is png"
4097480,4104840," hopefully uh why does it take so much time to download a goddamn emote i don't know why"
4104840,4112200," uh so copy uh-huh so that's probably why because it was downloading maybe some sort of a"
4113160,4118040," uh some sort of a thing and if i take a look at the file of this entire stuff it is a png"
4118040,4126840," so this is a poggers png uh right so then i can go into the renderer and here i can use the poggers"
4126840,4135640," png boom and it didn't work surprisingly okay uh so what's the compilation error poggers png does not"
4135640,4142600," exist uh it's it's a single pogger sure so this is poggers isn't that poggers i think it's pretty"
4142600,4152600," fucking poggers so yeah that is very very poggers that is as poggers as you can get uh so maybe we're"
4152600,4163480," gonna have like um radius like 500 so that is very poggers uh follow scale like around like 10"
4164200,4169320," oh"
4169320,4179000," all right so that's pretty cool what the fuck am i doing with my life anyway uh"
4179000,4187480," many poggers yes that that's as many poggers as you can get um so the radius is gonna be 300 let's say"
4189720,4203320," and what's you know what's funny you can at any point stop the whole process i think i think well"
4203320,4207320," you can't do that anymore oh i think i broke something"
4210840,4222200," uh i know all right so our like a game update code does not care about the pose state that is very"
4222200,4233960," important by the way uh so object update so essentially only when we're not in the pose state"
4233960,4241320," right because i also have a global pose state uh right so we have stuff like this and and that stops"
4241320,4250360," everything and then you can actually step through the entire thing if you have any sort of bugs uh"
4250360,4255080," right you can just step through the time and that allows you to do that if you want to debug something"
4255080,4264120," right so you just want to see something in here so that's a very very cool you can go back in time as"
4264120,4272200," well though again game code like when you update the object doesn't really care about the the stepping back"
4272200,4279560," unfortunately right so because it's stateful it's it is very very stateful but the animations that are not"
4279560,4289800," stateful like ripple animation uh they're actually fine so all righty all righty all righty all righty"
4289800,4297720," all righty you know what we would would be even cooler if we had like a single object and uh right when"
4297720,4306600," it moves it would leave the uh sort of ripples uh if that makes any sense right trail of ripples"
4306600,4312840," so we want to have like a several ripples then so how can we have several ripples"
4312840,4319000," uh i can have two ripples right essentially i can just like have two points"
4319000,4327320," uh of the of the sources of the of the ripple effect right uh but what if i want to have n of them"
4327720,4334840," what if i want to have n of them i suppose one way to achieve that is to actually"
4334840,4344520," have quad that sort of applies the ripple effect on everything that's behind it right and basically"
4344520,4350040," spawn that quads and yeah so that's probably how you would do that essentially"
4351160,4359240," right and you would probably create such quads in the post-processing here it's probably yeah you'll"
4359240,4363480," probably create them in the post-processing so in the post-processing uh you would have"
4363480,4370520," like a quad that renders the whole scene and then additional quads that render small subscenes with"
4370520,4376120," the ripple effect and you can have like a trail of them if that makes any sense does that make any sense"
4376120,4387080," probably uh so yes we used to uh and i can also go back into into this thing right so we're gonna have"
4387080,4395320," like a zozin uh zozin zozin let's let's actually make it a little bit bigger"
4395320,4404680," that makes very sense and by the way just for a record like i'm doing all of that for the first time"
4404680,4410680," my like maybe there is a better way of doing all of that stuff right so maybe there is a way better"
4410680,4416520," way of doing that uh but i've never done anything like that before so and that's actually pretty cool"
4416520,4422520," and like i'm surprised how simple the entire math is right you just like apply this sombrero function"
4422520,4427320," uh right for for anyone who just joined so this is basically how you do this ripple effect so it's a"
4427320,4433560," very simple article uh right so this is the entire function and you just like code that function into the"
4433560,4440040," fragment shader and you get this this is so cool i love that uh i didn't expect that it's gonna be so"
4440040,4446760," fucking simple and maybe you can again reiterate on that idea and uh just basically have more"
4446760,4453480," functions more different interesting functions that do uh different interesting things so you see you soon"
4453480,4460600," um kawaii freaking this um all right so maybe i'm gonna make a small break and after the break uh after"
4460600,4467320," i made a cup of tea we're gonna try to maybe create like multiple individual ripples right so i think that"
4467320,4476840," would be actually kind of cool um so yeah um all right so what i wanted to have uh i wanted to have uh"
4477480,4483400," basically several uh ripples right now as you can see we have sort of like a single ripple that starts"
4483400,4490280," from the center but the question is how can we have several of them right and uh i suppose i was"
4490280,4499240," already said we need to have like quads uh that you know form um that basically spawn the separate uh ripple"
4499240,4505640," effects there uh but it's gonna be it's gonna be kind of difficult to achieve because essentially what"
4505640,4512520," we'll need we'll need at least three shader programs the first shader program is the one that renders the"
4512520,4521080," objects and like rainbowish things the second shader program like uh does post processing right uh basically"
4521080,4527800," renders the uh this scene that we already rendered into a texture and then the third shader is going"
4527800,4533800," to be applying ripple effects into the post processing in different places and stuff like"
4533800,4539080," that so this is actually rather complicated i'm not sure i'll be able to do that within like a single stream"
4539080,4546600," uh so because it's rather complicated not gonna lie and we'll probably need like a separate"
4546600,4556440," sort of for renderer sort of speak right so uh let me see we have uh all of that stuff in the flash"
4556440,4566200," all right so this is going to be assets uh shader flash frag uh might as well actually just like bring back"
4566200,4573160," the um the program right and just keep it in the background for people who just join to see what"
4573160,4579160," exactly what exactly we're doing in here so maybe it's interesting for somebody uh right so it's going"
4579160,4585320," to be in the background doing its own thing uh maybe though we're going to try to make it a little bit"
4585320,4595320," slower right so it's going to be something like that all right um something like that"
4598520,4611880," though in the flash right uh shader flash shader flash uh actually flash frag right so here is the friend"
4611880,4623160," i'll have to do something different right i'll have to do something different so for now i would like to maybe"
4623160,4633160," disable the center i think but maybe not um so i have an idea so i already have a something called a renderer"
4633160,4640760," right so and the renderer contains all of the um you know vertices on all of the triangles that we're"
4640760,4649000," trying to render what if we create this second one right what if we had a second one uh"
4650360,4657800," for specifically ripple effects that would be kind of interesting so this we have a global renderer in"
4657800,4666040," here and uh here we can have uh another renderer right so this is the second renderer but that renderer is"
4666040,4674760," oh boy uh how can i call that this is the ripple renderer right so we can call it ripple renderer"
4676360,4683240," so this is the second one uh we have a global renderer and where do we initialize it so we're"
4683240,4691160," initializing it in here um and when i initialize the global renderer i create a new vao uh right i"
4691160,4702840," create new vao i create new objects um and stuff like that right uh-huh so which is totally fine which is"
4702840,4707640," totally fine um which is probably something that i might want to do"
4707640,4715400," and then we do reload look at that and when we're reloading the um"
4715400,4724200," this thing i suppose we're reloading very specific shaders where do we get the oh here it is so it's a vert"
4724200,4731880," path and frag path and frag path and we get those things from the uh configuration file um okay so that"
4731880,4739800," makes it a little bit complicated but that's fine that's fine i would rather prefer like have them from"
4739800,4745080," uh from the parameters right so i think it will be way better if they were parameters"
4745080,4753880," so let me do something like float vert path and float uh frag path um so i might as well"
4753880,4758520," so all of that is going to kill the current program so i'm going to do the following thing i'm going to"
4758520,4765880," rename uh this thing to ripple uh all right and i'm going to just run the ripple in the background like"
4765880,4771000," that uh hopefully that's not going to cause any problem because i'm definitely going to be rebuilding"
4771000,4775880," the entire stuff and doing something and that that's going to kill whatever we have in the background and"
4775880,4783320," we don't want to do that uh okay so here i do load shaders uh incompatible it's not float what the"
4783320,4792920," fuck am i doing it has to be const uh const char right so it has to be const char okay so what what"
4792920,4797800," is the other thing is the other thing and when i'm reloading this entire thing i also probably want to"
4797800,4808440," accept the path is from here uh too so that way i can actually customize um customize which uh a"
4808440,4815640," renderer uses which shaders i think that makes sense uh so this is a vert path and this is a frag path"
4816280,4823960," so apparently we've got some subs just a second um uh thank you so much nerd x uh i hope i pronounced"
4823960,4830120," you know correctly thank you so much for gifting one tier sub to an mignon uh i hope i announced your"
4830120,4835080," nickname correctly as well thank you thank you thank you um all right thank you for for the support"
4835080,4844440," um okay so i'm gonna pass it in here and now uh it is going to ask me uh what exactly i want in here"
4844440,4852440," so i'm reloading the global renderer and here i'm going to just use vert path and frag path uh vert path"
4852440,4862600," and frag path uh all right so when when i reload in this entire thing uh i also want to use vert path"
4862600,4872440," and frag path all right okay so we have a ripple renderer and um i suppose what we want to do we want"
4872440,4879160," to also initialize it so it's going to be our init uh ripple renderer right so we initialize in ripple"
4879160,4884840," renderer and we're reloading the ripple renderer as well for the vertex shader uh we're going to be using"
4884840,4894440," the main vertex uh right so i think main it just contains everything like uh yeah it's basically the"
4894440,4900760," same one right it's essentially the same one uh and for the fragment for the fragment we're going to be"
4900760,4912120," using the ripple one right i'm going to be literally using the ripple one main.c uh ripple frag ripple frag"
4912120,4925960," okay so let me see if this entire thing compiles and here is an interesting question will this entire thing"
4925960,4932280," still work uh it still work uh it still works surprisingly uh okay that's very cool"
4932280,4944840," uh so now i have sort of like two separate renderers uh i can try to maybe do something like this"
4946280,4957400," um um maybe restart everything like that uh huh so it should complain that there is no such thing in"
4957400,4965400," there and that's fine uh right that is totally fine uh okay so this is gonna be divert"
4966200,4980440," mm-hmm so here we're rendering the scene into the frame buffer right we're rendering the scene into the"
4980440,4991320," frame buffer then i'm rendering the whole the whole texture right the whole pre-process texture and on top of"
4991320,5002600," that i suppose now uh i want to render the additional thing right so i want to um i suppose just clean or"
5002600,5010360," clear right the same way i clear the um the global shader i'm going to be cleaning the ripple shader"
5010920,5017960," uh ripple ripple ripple renderer then i need to synchronize the uniforms i might as well just like"
5017960,5025080," steal the whole thing from here uh so but instead of the global one i'm going to be using the ripple renderer"
5025080,5033240," and uh also i'm going to be synchronizing the buffers all right i'm synchronizing the buffers"
5036040,5046760," repo renderer and then i'm just rendering the whole thing i'm just rendering the whole thing okay so and"
5046760,5053480," between these two things right between synchronizing the uniforms and synchronizing buffers i should be able"
5053480,5060520," to simply put some um some things in there right"
5061560,5071240," to put the quads and those squads are supposed to use the they're supposed to use"
5071240,5081400," the texture of the scene to produce the effect that is very interesting so i didn't know how to explain"
5081400,5087240," that i don't know how to explain that so i can try to draw that right so let's actually try to draw that"
5087240,5094680," maybe it's going to make a little bit more sense so we have the uh screen right so and we're rendering"
5094680,5102040," the scene right and the scene consists of the uh several squares in here right so we have them like"
5102040,5109880," this so we're not rendering that scene into the screen we're rendering it into the texture so this"
5109880,5116840," entire screen is in within the texture then we're taking that texture and only then rendering this entire"
5116840,5125000," texture and this is needed so i can post process the the entire scene and have like a global ripple effect"
5125000,5131480," so that's how i achieve this global ripple effect through post processing so if i want to have localized"
5131480,5139640," um localized ripple effects i'll have to in the post processing phase uh use quads"
5140520,5149080," that use the texture of the scene to sort of like localize it in here and warp specific sub region of"
5149080,5155640," that scene so that's how i have to achieve that right first i need to render this scene into a texture"
5155640,5162680," then render the texture itself and then on top of that texture i have to put the quads that use sub texture"
5162680,5167720," and warp that and warp that specific sub texture to create like localized effects of warpness does that"
5167720,5175960," make any sense right so there's like three steps in here draw the scene then put the texture and then"
5176760,5186040," on top of that texture like puts the uh the warp effect"
5186040,5202200," all righty so that's pretty pogue i will never be able to do that um okay so i want to put some sort of uh"
5202680,5209800," yeah let's just let's just put a single quad in there uh this one is going to be our uh quad cr r quad"
5209800,5220920," cr cr stands for center radius right uh-huh so and i'm gonna probably just use the uh the position"
5220920,5229480," zero zero right so this is the position zero zero uh-huh and we're gonna use the object size so the"
5230200,5239640," localized warp effect is going to be is going to have the size of the um inside the logic um so now"
5239640,5247960," let me maybe try to do the following thing when i reload everything so when i press f5 right when i"
5247960,5256920," press f5 i'm reloading uh the configuration right and then i'm reloading the config itself right so here i'm"
5256920,5264200," reloading the config itself uh and another thing i probably have to do here is this so i'm reloading"
5264200,5271960," this one and then i also want to reload the ripple one right i want to reload the ripple one"
5271960,5273160," um"
5273160,5279800," ripple renderer and in here we're going to be using what"
5279800,5289400," yeah so that's the that's the stuff"
5289400,5298440," cool so we're we're loading the global renderer then we are reloading the ripple renderer"
5298440,5304280," and uh that should be it okay so another thing i want to do in the flash"
5305960,5312440," stuff i want to disable completely disable the ripple effect i'm going to be disabling the ripple effect"
5312440,5316600," uh right because now it's not going to be there it's going to be on a different level completely"
5316600,5327000," uh so and let me take that stuff and just uh oh there we go so let's fix all the compilation errors"
5327000,5334040," and what do we have in here okay that's cool we don't have a ripple effect anymore but we don't have"
5334040,5344200," anything localized either which is rather interesting all right the question is why why did we have"
5344920,5352200," anything localized anything localized probably because uh we'll have to when we synchronize"
5352200,5360920," when we synchronize the uniforms of a particular renderer right we do not take into account the"
5360920,5370680," texture of that specific renderer uh-huh actually texture unit right so actually texture unit so in the"
5370680,5379000," shaders like uh main frag we just have attack right we just have attack so but we never actually"
5379000,5387480," explicitly set it anywhere so i think i need to go to the uniforms and do something like uh tech uniform"
5387480,5389880," so i think we're going to take a look for the renderer right"
5389880,5404760," okay so this uh let me take a look at this thing this is going to be four uh-huh tech uh tech all right"
5404760,5416520," and another one is four and when i'm updating this thing it's a tech uniform uh and here we have a tech unit"
5417080,5429160," i think this this is how i'm going to call it so glu int tech tech right like a later in tech uh so this"
5429160,5438120," one is going to be one f okay so and when i'm doing that so for that one uh i think for the main renderer"
5438120,5443080," the uh the unit is going to be zero right so that's the unit and for the second one the unit is going to be"
5443080,5453000," actually one right uh the unit is actually one and did it create the um okay so there is some stuff in"
5453000,5459880," here okay that's fine that's actually good that we have something uh fail to read main word no such okay"
5459880,5467160," so i see i see what's going on so it's uh throwing errors and shit so this one is supposed to be shaders"
5468440,5475320," uh shaders and let me find the second main word and this one is supposed to be shaders uh shaders that"
5475320,5481160," explains what's going on in there that actually explains everything okay so do we still have"
5481160,5489960," this stuff shading all over the place um uh is the sampler not for oh okay i see i'm sorry oh i'm sorry"
5489960,5501960," so it has to be i uh and suppose the unit maybe has to be as well like the gl int not glu int uh gl uniform"
5501960,5510440," one i when you set it like one i do you accept int or or something else you accept ints so because of that"
5510440,5517880," we want to accept ints in here too all right so do we have anything else in here okay so it's still shading"
5517880,5529480," all over the place uh has one component not too excuse me am i an idiot"
5529480,5539720," so we got a sub by the way i need to address it just a second uh so any uwu or war thank you so much for"
5539720,5544840," twitch crimes subscription okay thank you thank you and welcome to our epic open gl club that is right"
5544840,5552600," that is right thank you thank you thank you so gl uniform to tech um i don't really know i'm not really"
5552600,5562520," sure that i'm using uh two in there i'm pretty sure i don't so that's kind of ridiculous in my opinion"
5562520,5572200," so if i disable that uh is it going to be doing that crazy stuff okay so let me"
5574360,5578520," let me find um"
5578520,5585000," so am i rebuilding yes i am rebuilding so why would it do that"
5585000,5589400," so in how many places i do that"
5589400,5595400," tech uniform uniform color"
5595400,5599400," flash sync um"
5604360,5611320," oh i think oh oh oh oh oh oh i see i see i see i think i know what's going on i have to rebind the"
5611320,5618440," program yes i completely forgot to do that uh right so it's open gl uh letting me know about itself"
5618440,5623720," right so we have to bind this program then you'll be able to do that then we bind this program for the"
5623720,5631560," flash and i completely forgot that after that i have to do what i have to like use the uh ripple renderer"
5631560,5637640," program right so that one so then we have to clean everything then only then synchronize the uniforms"
5637640,5640760," and yeah i completely forgot that i have to do it like that"
5640760,5647400," uh okay so it at least it is not shedding all over the place which is already good"
5648040,5658600," it doesn't have the localized thingy though right uh it doesn't have a localized thingy though yet"
5660360,5667400," which is fine um ripple renderer and i'm just trying to render all these things"
5667400,5680760," okay so we're getting there i think i think we're getting there uh so this is a ripple"
5685160,5690520," maybe this is because i disabled the synchronization of the textures no i didn't actually the synchronization"
5690520,5700440," of the textures is fine um so there's something something wrong something definitely wrong uh is"
5700440,5709640," that because i'm using okay so here i can use zero and i can try to use zero and that should give me"
5710760,5720280," something something so what if i use object that is actually smaller right because i want to see some"
5720280,5729560," something right i want to see some effects but i don't see any effects um which is sad so we're using"
5730120,5738840," this thing right we're using this thing oh also i probably have to also re-bind the vao the current vao"
5738840,5748120," okay so yeah uh that's probably what we have to do gl uh bind uh vertex"
5748120,5757720," bind vertex array vertex array this one is going to be vi oh that's probably what i have to do of course"
5757720,5766280," uh i forgot to do a lot of things actually um so and here i'll have to bind the ripple renderer one"
5766280,5777480," uh okay so will that will that produce anything i wonder i wonder okay so at least we we don't see"
5777480,5786040," anything anymore that's nice uh that's super nice but if i just keep it like that uh just keep playing that"
5786040,5815640," okay so i think i completely broke the intestine um um um oh boy uh so i don't really know why it doesn't work"
5815640,5824280," work so if i don't bind any vaos it is working fine probably because it's using the vao that is bind by"
5824280,5832680," the second initialization right so if i do uh our init we bind that one so that's the one that is used for"
5832680,5841160," whatever reason uh which is not what we want which is not entirely what we want"
5843800,5850440," um"
5850440,5852600," so use that program"
5852600,5858360," so if i do it like that"
5858360,5864120," okay so it is using the wrong one"
5864120,5869800," it is always using the wrong one but if i always bind that one"
5871160,5871960," is it gonna work"
5871960,5874360," is it gonna work no it doesn't work"
5874360,5877800," um"
5877800,5879240," interesting"
5879240,5885480," interesting interesting interesting interesting so vao"
5885480,5888600," why would it be like that"
5891320,5896600," um um"
5896600,5902120," do i also have to bind vbo then i probably have to also bind vbo"
5902120,5906040," uh r let's let me take a look"
5906040,5913800," so because i'm not an opengl developer so sometimes i may not know some like crucial things so i really"
5913800,5923080," apologize for that uh okay so i never bind that but i always bind this thing so hopefully that is"
5923080,5927560," yeah okay so that makes sense that makes all of a sense thank you thank you thank you that is very"
5927560,5934520," very cool all right i think i'm getting into something uh gl bind um buffer all right all right"
5934520,5939160," all right all right all right that's very very cool uh so we might be getting somewhere"
5939160,5948120," ripple renderer oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy hopefully okay"
5950360,5959720," still doesn't do much still doesn't do though i can try to um in the ripple fragment thingy"
5959720,5967000," just always set the color to something like very very red right so we can instantly see that the"
5967000,5973720," uh shader is working at least right because that's what we want to see we want to see the shader working"
5974440,5982920," uh this for now can we see anything okay we can't see anything so that means like it doesn't really draw"
5982920,5988920," at all uh doesn't really draw at all"
5988920,5998040," so i would expect it to have like object size but maybe not um"
6001480,6008680," okay i see what's going on i caught it caught it copy paste copy paste code actually ruined everything"
6008680,6020440," okay oh here is the red in the post processing yes that is very very cool so this is additional quad"
6020440,6027480," in the post processing which is like sets us to the uh to the success this entire thing sets us to the huge"
6027480,6037240," huge success uh my god okay so now we can have this like thing that is bigger uh right and now if i go"
6037240,6042520," into this fragment shader and i'm start using the texture that we're supposed to be using we're gonna"
6042520,6048520," see a very strange result we're supposed to be seeing a very strange result because the current"
6048520,6055320," texture that we're using is the texture into which we're rendering the whole scene if everything is set up"
6055320,6063240," correctly in that red quad we should be seeing the whole scene squashed and stretched to fit into that"
6063240,6070760," quad if we did everything correctly we should see that right you see what i mean right let's take a look"
6077960,6085400," it is it is not correct but it is something it is using texture it is definitely using the texture but"
6085400,6091320," it's using the wrong texture it is not using the texture of the scene it is using the texture of a"
6091320,6098600," single object so at least we know where is the bug right so you see because this is the texture of the"
6098600,6105000," the object but there is no effect uh rainbow effect on the object so it's the only thing that doesn't have"
6105000,6114200," the rainbow effect uh so yeah let me see uh how we can fix that so basically have to set the proper"
6114200,6121480," uh texture oh yeah so essentially i said the texture you need to zero which is the wrong texture so we have to"
6121480,6133560," set it to one all right so now you can see that do you see the whole scene squashed to fit into that"
6133560,6136360," thingy that's what i was talking about"
6136360,6143960," right so that's basically what's going on so in the post processing we do have"
6145480,6156120," the whole scene right that's actually pretty funny so yeah that's actually really cool um"
6156120,6163640," so we render the scene into the texture and then we're using that texture"
6163640,6172760," okay cool uh so let me see what we can do about that so i can now even apply"
6173720,6179800," the ripple effect right so i'm actually like uh putting it upside down i think i need to like put"
6179800,6186120," it like this uh so it doesn't go upside down right so it's it's actually correct now as you can see so"
6186120,6194600," it is correct but it's mirroring itself essentially um now what i want to do i want to just go ahead"
6194600,6202360," and apply the ripple effect right the ripple effect in the post processing in that localized space"
6203560,6207160," right so as you can see yeah this is basically what we have right now"
6207160,6216200," we have a ripple effect in that localized space but this is the problem right um we're using the whole"
6216200,6223720," texture we're not supposed to be using the whole texture in that specific place we're supposed to be"
6223720,6235560," finding the the subtexture we're supposed to be finding that's the subtexture for this thing uh all right"
6235560,6246200," and that is something that probably has to be done in where in the vertex shader right so the vertex shaders"
6246200,6249480," should give us the correct sort of like coordinates and whatnot"
6249480,6255240," mm-hmm that is very interesting"
6255240,6262440," all right so that's actually very very cool"
6262440,6271000," uh let me uh go to the render config what i want to do i want to reduce the amount of objects so let's"
6271000,6276040," actually say that we're going to have three of them all right because i want to i want to be able to"
6276040,6283960," see the scene after post processing right so yeah that's what we have the scene after post processing"
6283960,6289160," it's actually very cool i'm actually learning a lot"
6289720,6294120," hmm i've never done this kind of stuff before but yeah"
6294120,6305000," it's so cool anyway so maybe i'm gonna actually keep this thing in here while i'm you know doing stuff"
6305000,6314040," go go back go back in here all right so"
6319240,6330040," um so what i wanted to do what i wanted to do what i wanted to do i wanted to uh go to the main vert and"
6330040,6336680," i didn't think i want to mess with the main vert i didn't think so right so we probably need to create"
6336680,6346600," something like a uh ripple uh vert right so i'm gonna copy paste this thing uh into repo vert and it's"
6346600,6357560," going to be just a copy for now uh but then i can do the following thing uh main vert uh repo vert and"
6357560,6365480," another one uh repo vert so let me close that and let me restart this entire thing hopefully that will"
6365480,6373800," uh work properly and now i'm going to go into the into the other thing so i want to check if the hot"
6373800,6379880," reloading actually works does it still work so if i do something like this uh there we go so it's working"
6379880,6386360," so i managed to disable the uh ripple effect and i enabled it back right everything should be okay"
6387080,6398360," so and in a ripple vert essentially we have the vert position vert uh like very ub oh this one is interesting okay"
6403480,6407320," we set very uv like this right"
6407320,6413720," so that means"
6413720,6425320," we probably want to do that on cpu we probably want to set the uv coordinates for this quad on the cpu"
6426440,6435800," i think i think i think that's what we want to do okay so let me find a quad cr um right and when"
6435800,6442760," we set in the quads okay so here we're just like literally hot coding the uv coordinates that's literally"
6442760,6450760," what we do we heard coding the uv coordinates maybe this is not something that we want to do right that's for"
6450760,6454760," i think that's for sure and that's for sure for sure"
6454760,6472120," so we'll have to do some other stuff"
6472520,6492200," okay so i kind of want to like create this second uh this second function that computes the uv coordinates slightly differently"
6492200,6500520," so here we set the uv coordinates like like to zero one uh manually but now we need to be able to set them"
6500520,6504520," based on the current resolution on the current resolution plus"
6504520,6512840," but we kind of know the current resolution in the vertex shader right so we can do that yeah"
6512840,6518200," we do have a resolution so that should be fine so uv kind of becomes useless if you think about that"
6518200,6527800," well i mean it's not that useless um you kind of know how to offset things all right if that makes any sense"
6528840,6534760," you kind of know how to set thing but maybe not anyway so uh we have the position"
6534760,6545320," and then we are mapping that thing to the screen we're mapping that thing to the screen"
6545320,6553800," uh right so but the screen coordinates are actually very interesting the screen coordinates are very very"
6553800,6561400," interesting uh right so this one is going to be half of the width right so this is minus half of the width"
6561400,6570600," uh this is half of the height and this is minus half of the height right okay cool and"
6570600,6577240," right so first thing i want to do first thing i want to do i want to kind of"
6580600,6590840," map it from zero to this and this from zero to this and this and how can i do that how can i do that"
6590840,6597560," i suppose i can add half of the width and half of the height right so i can always add it so if i have"
6597560,6603800," some sort of some sort of a position i just add uh half of the resolution right so and that way i now have"
6603800,6613400," this thing and this thing so after that uh i can basically divide it by resolution"
6613400,6621960," right so because that point to get sort of like uv coordinates for that specific point what i have to do"
6621960,6628040," is just like divide it by width and divide it by height which creates a really strange situation right"
6628040,6633080," so i divide it by resolution like this and i divide this by resolution like this and this is sort of like"
6633080,6639480," becomes like that uh right and essentially what i have to do i just have to take my original point and"
6639480,6652840," divided by two resolutions right no no no no no i'm gonna use uh by a resolution and add uh half"
6652840,6660360," right and add half and that way okay so that that makes sense i suppose or does it"
6664920,6671560," does it make sense doesn't make sense probably probably does make sense so uh okay so where are"
6671560,6680520," my things so here they are so now i'm going to be changing the uv coordinates to fit that so here i'm"
6680520,6687560," just passing uv coordinates but it doesn't matter so what i need to do in here is just to take my uh verb"
6687560,6703480," position right uh verb position divided by resolution divided by resolution and add half right and i did it"
6703480,6716520," i have a localized warp effect look at that isn't that cool i have a localized square"
6717640,6723560," this is what i was talking about yeah there is a single localized square but unfortunately it is too"
6723560,6729480," obvious that it is a square right this is what i was trying to achieve the whole time this is so cool"
6729480,6733400," uh it would be kind of cool if we could"
6733400,6743320," i don't know like make this warp effect to not reach the edges if that makes any sense"
6744040,6750360," can you not make it reach the edges so because so it's not obvious that it is a square because it's"
6750360,6760920," too fucking obvious um all right so we can go to uh to the ripple right so i i didn't like i i didn't"
6760920,6766360," even expect to actually manage to do that on the stream this is so cool i really like that uh okay so"
6766360,6773800," let me let me let me go to the ripple frag and uh in here what we can do so we're sort of like using"
6773800,6781720," this as a radius all right but maybe we can for now put like a hack and if this thing doesn't fit a"
6781720,6789320," certain condition just like don't use anything oh boy all right so"
6789320,6798040," i need to probably take a look at this stuff"
6802520,6806040," so suppose this thing keeps rippling more and more"
6806040,6812760," and the radius"
6812760,6823080," so the bigger the radius the closer i want this thing to be to zero"
6825000,6826440," that's what i want to have"
6826440,6837400," right so if we had some sort of like um big radius so i suppose the radius in here is going"
6837400,6846360," to be from zero to one um right and i can do something like c length uh and basically divide it"
6846360,6855880," by half right divided by half right divided by half and then i can probably mix uh between"
6855880,6871800," this original value right this original value and zero based on that so sort of like smooth it out"
6871800,6879080," towards um towards the edges like uh yeah i'm not sure if it's gonna work it's just like i'm"
6879080,6885000," pulling out out of my ass uh but maybe maybe it will kind of"
6885000,6890680," smooth out the edges you still kind of see the edges"
6890680,6894280," uh"
6897800,6910040," so if i make 25"
6910040,6919720," nah i'll need to think how to do that i'll need to think how to um yeah"
6919720,6927080," how to make it like more rounded unfortunately i'm streaming for uh like for two hours already right"
6927080,6933560," so i'm not thinking straight so i'm gonna leave it as a homework for for the viewers how would you"
6933560,6938840," solve this problem how would you make uh the edges of that square not visible or maybe you would go"
6938840,6944360," with a completely different approach maybe you're not gonna go with like a post-processing quad maybe"
6944360,6949080," you're gonna do that entirely in the fragment shader or something like that but the the goal is to have"
6949080,6956040," arbitrary amount of this ripple effects if you know what that what i mean right so i could probably go on"
6956040,6962360," more but again when i'm streaming for more than two now two hours like my brain uh you know is starting"
6962360,6969560," to shut down so i can't think properly so yeah i guess i'm gonna call it a day uh that's it for today"
6969560,6975320," thanks uh everyone who's uh watching right now i really appreciate it uh i'm probably gonna i don't"
6975320,6981320," know if i want to upload this source code somewhere right because it's a basically like a scratch code"
6981960,6987160," uh right i'm not sure if it's gonna be useful for anyone i suppose the most useful thing is this"
6987160,6993640," article which actually like gives you the description of this um you know ripple effect"
6996360,7001640," so when i recommend to check it out so if you're watching on a twitch i'm gonna post it in in the"
7001640,7005400," chat right so here it is and if you're watching on youtube i'm gonna post it in the description"
7005400,7013400," uh so let's actually you know put like a huge quad uh on the entire screen just to get the you know"
7013400,7021080," the final application working for now uh so let me see let me see where is the stuff"
7022280,7030600," so this is the object size but instead of object size i'm gonna just set uh maybe width and height"
7030600,7035080," maybe half of the of those things right so this is gonna be half of those things"
7035080,7044600," so let's restart the whole thing uh it has to be just a single one and yeah that's what we managed to do"
7044600,7055800," today right so we explored the ripple effect that's very cool all right does anyone have any questions maybe"
7057720,7064120," does anyone have any questions um so let me let me change something here"
7064120,7076440," um target target um where is my target target x um so somewhere though yeah follow uh let's actually"
7076440,7087400," remove uh this thing from here um all right does anyone have any questions people people people people"
7087400,7108280," do you have a repo a repo for what uh i do have a repo for opengl template that i've been using but"
7108280,7114360," i'm not sure if i'm gonna make it a part of the opengl repo uh i suppose i can upload the code of this"
7114360,7119800," thing uh after the stream uh after the stream so i recommend to check out my what's channel uh right"
7119800,7124920," so where i upload the recordings of the stream so and the repo is going to be in the description"
7124920,7134280," did you try to render the square as a circle aka just discard any pixels far from the center of the"
7134280,7139560," square i think it will make it super obvious that it's a circle right so you would see the edges of the"
7139560,7149880," circle what i want to do i want the um edges of the ripple effects to like smoothly fade out without"
7149880,7155320," creating any ridges or like any visible ridges so that's what i'm trying to achieve i could try to do"
7155320,7160440," that but i'm already tired right so so i can try to think about that tomorrow already"
7162920,7166760," so maybe there are some tricks to to do that maybe some cool tricks"
7166760,7176680," all right i guess that's it for the day thanks everyone who is watching right now i hope this"
7176680,7181080," session was entertaining and interesting right so because like i think i learned a lot"
7181720,7187560," um hope you did too and i see you all on the next session i love you"
