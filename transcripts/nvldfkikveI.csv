34960,43600," topic today we're doing a very special topic uh thank you so much uh copper case it for 27 months"
43600,47680," of tier one subscription thank you thank you thank you and welcome to our epic temple os club"
48400,54240," welcome to our epic temple so uh today we're doing advent of code 2021 i forgot to actually"
54240,59920," mention it's 2021 in temple os that's what we're doing uh what it's all about i'm gonna get into"
59920,65520," that a little bit later uh twitch.tv/todding and i'm gonna ping everyone who's interested in being"
65520,72160," pinged somebody sneakily called themselves pingly um and now i want to ping them right but i'm not"
72160,75680," gonna ping them all right so the stream has officially started"
75680,84080," the stream has officially started and uh yeah so today we're starting advent of code and for those"
84080,91440," who doesn't know advent of code is an annual event where um basically through like starting from december"
91440,100240," 1st up until december 25th uh you're given one problem to solve right every day and it's like basically"
100240,106320," the advent calendar right so i don't know anything about advent calendar uh because i'm coming from"
106320,113520," the orthodox world not from the catholic one so uh i actually like before i learned english and actually"
113520,121200," started to do advent of code i never heard of such concept as advent calendar at all in my entire life uh"
121760,128640," yeah so uh so just something to uh to be aware of right so i'm coming from a completely different uh"
128640,134240," cultural world where this uh is not a thing right so i was actually quite surprised that it's a thing"
134240,141120," in uh in central europe in u.s uh probably in canada i don't know where where it is but in from the world"
141120,146160," where i'm coming from this is not a thing so i just don't know it's it's basically like a advent calendar"
146160,154880," and uh yeah so we already did this thing last year and uh the challenge of the last year was that"
154880,160240," uh i have to use a different language for each individual problem right uh so let's actually start"
160240,169600," uh to um you know keep track of the description configs 21 says whoop whoop whoop whoop indeed"
169600,172880," thank you so much for two months of tier one subscription thank you thank you thank you and"
172880,178960," welcome to our epic temple uh that's right uh so uh let's actually start keeping track of the"
178960,184640," description so i have a description file from a uh previous stream so i think i'm gonna actually comment"
184640,190320," it out so the stream was about uh i think it was a port where we removed overloading right so i'm"
190320,195200," gonna actually mark it like this and i'm gonna open the new description file uh description id this"
195200,201840," is a reference and uh in the reference i'm gonna give the link to advent of code check it out advent of"
201840,209120," code uh there we go so check it out i'm gonna actually put that in the chat for everyone who's"
209120,213200," watching live and for people who's watching on youtube you're gonna find this thing in the description of"
213200,219280," course uh all right so as i already said in the previous year the challenge was to use a different"
219280,226080," language for each individual day so and i put all of the solutions in this repo you can find it in the"
226080,236560," description as well uh solutions solutions for advent of code 2020 you can find it in here and i'm gonna"
236560,242880," copy that in the uh in the chat as well for anyone who's interested so the challenge of today's year as"
242880,248080," already mentioned in the previous in the announcement right is going to be solving all of the problems in"
248080,254240," holy sea inside of the temple os uh for those who never heard about temple os it's a very special"
254240,260080," operating system it's a very interesting operating system it's not like um it's not like a distribution"
260080,265360," of linux or anything like that it's an operating system that is written from scratch by a very famous"
265360,272000," person uh terry davis uh right so you can find it in here and uh of course i'm gonna put that in the"
272000,277920," description temple or ads so here it is and for anyone who's watching live i'm gonna copy that in"
277920,285040," the chat so here it is here is the uh here is the link so uh one of the things uh about the author of that"
285040,291520," operating system is that he suffered through his entire life i'm not sure if the entire life but like"
292080,298960," maybe half of his life uh from psychopharynia so uh if you want to donate to me this month while"
298960,305200," i'm doing advent of code consider actually donating to the charities down below in here instead right"
305200,311440," so there's a couple of charities put in here that do research on uh how they say so let me actually call"
311440,316400," them uh organization working on needs to pain and suffering caused by mental illnesses so consider"
316400,322560," donating there instead of me this month um all right so and essentially this entire operating system is"
322560,330000," basically like a commodore 64 but for a modern computer right so that's basically what it is and"
330000,337680," what's interesting is that it has a built-in c compiler uh that uh you know compiles uh your code"
337680,343680," just in time and you can use that c compiler as the shell scripting language of the operating system and"
343680,350240," the whole operating system is built on top of that shell language and that language is called holy c uh"
350240,357200," it's a very interesting concept it's pretty cool and uh it's designed for like modern 64 x86 64 computers"
357200,364960," uh right so um richie1309 thank you so much for twitch prime subscription thank you thank you thank you and"
364960,369680," welcome to our epic temple um cheers by the way"
369680,380000," just in time and ahead of time i see just ahead of time okay oh my god this is such a cool idea like"
380000,386000," develop just ahead of time compiler yeah that's actually a pretty cool idea so and uh the whole operating"
386000,393680," system is just like like a single iso file and what we're gonna do on today's stream um since usually the"
393680,398960," first problem of advent of code is like very very simple it's just like to warm you up it's some"
398960,405520," sort of like hello world uh i'm not probably gonna spend too much time on solving it so and because of"
405520,411600," that i decided to spend the first string setting up the development environment right so we're gonna"
411600,417440," start from scratch we're gonna download iso file of temple os we're gonna set up qema virtual machine"
417440,423040," we're gonna install uh the temple os there we're gonna go through the tour the temple os by the way"
423040,430000," comes with its own tutorial there's a built-in tutorial thank you david terry davis for building"
430000,434880," that this entire thing so you can go to the tutorial and learn the basics of the parenting system so we're"
434880,439360," gonna do that on the stream and once we learn the basics of the operating system how to write programs"
439360,444720," we're gonna try to solve the first problem so that's basically the plan of today's stream it's basically the"
444720,451520," plan uh okay thank you so much everyone who subscribed d fra thank you so much for which crime and"
451520,458480," not another not a lift one five one thank you so much for uh tier three two months of tier three thank"
458480,472320," you so much um all right so uh let me uh let me see okay uh let's go um to do two so i'm gonna go in here"
472320,478320," and i think i already prepared everything i think i already downloaded the iso you can download that iso"
478320,484800," like by pressing this button and i already prepared everything so in the folder aoc 2021"
484800,497760," god damn it so i forgot that i installed sl uh so do you guys know what is a cell have you guys heard"
497760,507680," about it so there's a pretty funny uh pretty funny command called sl uh which stands for steam locomotive"
507680,513360," locomotive i don't know how to pronounce that word but essentially it's a joke command in case you"
513360,520320," misspell ls right so you install it on your machine and every time you misspell ls you have to wait until"
520320,525360," the train passes by through your entire screen and what's funny is that you you you cannot cancel it if"
525360,529680," you press ctrl c it actually blocks ctrl c there's literally nothing you can do about it you have to"
529680,534640," wait uh until the end of the thing i keep forgetting that i installed this entire thing"
534640,540480," uh all right so we have a temple os a thingy and also i have a custom installation of qemo"
540480,545600," because the quma that comes with debian is actually kind of buggy to be fair like i have"
545600,550080," always have a lot of problems with qema that comes with debian so i usually just build"
550080,554880," my own quma from scratch and install it in the home folder uh right so we're going to use the"
554880,560800," qms 6.1 i think it's like the latest table or something like that and let's actually go ahead"
560800,569680," and try to run uh the um the iso let me actually start with the tmux or something uh god damn it"
569680,579760," why is that a theme of today's stream i didn't really understand anyway uh so uh yeah i accidentally copy"
579760,584560," pasted what i actually selected so i selected the documentation of the cell and then"
584560,588480," pressed like a button that is responsible for copy pasting or something like that holy"
588480,595200," shit uh anyway so i don't mean to do that i'm not doing that intentionally by the way i think"
595200,600720," i'm a little bit nervous right now uh because it's like you know the first the first event of code"
600720,607920," uh qima x system x86 64 as far as i know you just use cd wrong command and you just say temple"
607920,614960," as uh temple as iso and that should just start the thing oh okay so this one is interesting requires uh"
614960,621680," half of a gig of the megabyte of ram so i don't remember how you allocate that i think uh let me"
621680,636640," actually see uh so it's gonna be help uh and can i do ram uh to to to ram disk uh so memory uh uh qima"
636640,645680," ram how do you do ram because i don't remember uh minus m okay so i'm gonna do minus m uh in here so cd"
645680,655200," rom minus m 512. uh okay looks like it's okay now it's loading compiler uh can i actually zoom in"
655200,660720," so i can actually zoom in this thing a little bit but can i just make it uh fit okay so i can actually"
660720,667120," make it fit so it's loading a little bit slower but maybe this is because i need to set up the uh kvm"
667120,675600," thingy so let me quickly do that uh so just a second so we need to enable i think uh qemo kvm"
676640,687280," right uh to to how do i enable kvm uh literally enable kvm okay so for this one there's no kvm is"
687280,692320," just basically virtualization uh or something like that it's just like uses the kernel virtualization"
692320,699440," thingy uh enable kvm so maybe it's gonna run a little bit faster now uh and i have to do this thing"
700400,705920," uh zoom to fit every time so i think it loads a little bit faster okay so uh right after of the"
705920,711280," bat it suggests you to install this entire thing on the hard drive but the problem here is that we don't"
711280,718320," have a hard drive uh right so and it also suggests you to take a tour uh walrus for walrus world thank"
718320,723120," you so much for 12 months of tier one subscription thank you thank you thank you and welcome to our"
723120,731360," epic temple um cheers by the way so yeah it comes with like this tutorial and there's a lot of like"
731360,736320," sections in here like the help system how to use the help system the basics editing and running"
736320,740800," programs i think we're going to be interested in the part three because that's literally what i want"
740800,746640," from temple os this month i want to editing and running programs i'm not sure if i am that interested"
746640,752240," in the rest of the things but we will actually see uh we'll actually see so for now i think i need to"
752240,757920," create the hard drive right so where we're going to be installing things and if i remember correctly"
757920,766560," you can create the hard drive um you can create the hard drive by using qima uh image yeah there we go"
766560,777360," so you can use qima image uh let me see and how do you even use this entire thing qima image uh qima image"
777360,782480," so there is a create sub command you provide the file and you provide the size that's actually pretty"
782480,791760," cool okay so let's do um qima image and i'm gonna create uh i'm gonna create aoc 2021 and uh as far as i"
791760,797680," know it's usually called just imagery and i'm gonna say 112 megabytes uh right there we go it created"
797680,802560," an image of the size of 112 bytes i actually need megabytes does it support like multipliers"
802560,808880," or something like that it does support multipliers okay that's cool um so if i remember correctly"
808880,818560," uh if i remember correctly to enable actually this is not particularly convenient uh because the camera"
818560,825280," the camera actually kind of hides everything so it does not allow me to uh easily um you know you"
825280,829920," know zoom in and stuff like that but basically type this command so it's not particularly convenient"
829920,842160," so 112 and um so i think it was hda right it was hda or something like that aoc uh 2021 and there we go"
842960,851040," uh okay so it's loading compiler okay so it's kind of annoying that i have to do this uh zoom to fit"
851040,857200," yeah i wonder if there is like a flag that always enables it or some sort of like a um you know option"
857200,863440," in the configuration let's actually install this thing are you installing inside of vm where qima virtual"
863440,869840," box or similar virtual machine yes i am i'm doing that it's normal for this freeze for this to freeze for a"
869840,878480," moment or two okay let's actually do that uh okay so i hope it found the hard drive i hope it did"
878480,888400," um is there any benefits using qima or virtual box in linux i have no idea actually i know nothing about"
888400,895200," virtual machines uh but i just personally like qima for its simplicity virtual boxes just like looks very"
895200,900320," over complicated i like qima that it's just a single command that should just run and it just works"
900320,906240," and creates like a very very minimalistic window and that's it uh virtual box is just like it has"
906240,910320," too many buttons too many options and just like really overwhelming for me so"
910320,917280," so right now we're installing uh temple wise so everyone what's up hi"
919920,928640," really let's see um to two to two so i suppose it's just like doing so the like terry said that"
928640,935440," it can freeze for a while so we should not be scared if it freezes or you know stuff like that hello hello"
935440,948880," okay so it's copying files that's what real installation should be just copying files from one uh you know"
948880,951600," device to another one that's basically the installation"
951600,963280," i'm drinking earl gay today by the way"
963280,973680," streaming is pixelized uh this is probably because there's a lot of moving things uh in here so if i"
973680,978640," switch to a different window we should not be pixelized but then we won't be able to see what's"
978640,983040," going on we want to be able to see uh the progress of the installation so it's quite important"
983040,989040," i could do gifted a tier one sub to ceremony thank you thank you so much for uh gifting to one sub and"
989040,994720," ceremony welcome to our epic temple os club yeah right"
1000480,1006160," all righty so is it bad that it's like a red or something like that"
1006160,1012800," um i hope we didn't run out of space or something so hopefully it's fine"
1012800,1025920," anonymous user is gifting 501 subs to certain community thank you so much for gifting 501 subs and"
1025920,1030800," everyone who's got this up uh welcome to our epic 30 community um"
1030800,1038400," so i was gonna do to do to do to do to do for a while like at least like five times"
1039840,1053120," so get ready for that"
1061120,1070480," um 30 fps by the way console friendly it is in fact uh 30 fps i wonder if you can you can get"
1070480,1073520," it higher but maybe it's capped at 30 fps who knows"
1073520,1079520," what language are you going to use inside temple os there's only one"
1079520,1083200," an only language i've uh allowed inside of temple os"
1083200,1092880," okay so it says reboot now uh let's go ahead and reboot so it suggests to load i think it installed it"
1092880,1099600," in into drive c so we're going to select drive c and uh i think yeah so when it says uncompressed"
1099600,1106240," uncompressed dictionary i think it means that um it means we installed everything correctly and anonymous"
1106240,1111120," it's gifting another five tier one subs thank you so much uh thank you thank you thank you um and"
1111120,1113840," everyone who's got this up welcome to our epic community"
1113840,1126960," all right"
1133040,1140960," all right so there is another 10 uh 10 gifted subs again from the anonymous thank you so much for"
1140960,1145760," gifting the subs i really really appreciate that uh so what we're doing right now we're just"
1145760,1152480," uncompressing the dictionary whatever that's supposed to mean so yeah just uncompressing the dictionary"
1159680,1163200," i'm gonna pour another cup of tea while we're waiting for uncompressing dictionary"
1163200,1171040," and uh i don't know we're gonna try to maybe take a tour i kind of roughly remember how to use temple"
1171040,1180000," os because i already did a stream on temple os uh i think a year ago or two and i roughly remember how"
1180000,1186960," to use it roughly so it's interesting whether my knowledge is enough to actually do that uh to actually"
1186960,1191600," you know write a program or something like that but maybe not maybe i should not take a chance and"
1191600,1196880," just go through the tutorial just to get the gist of how to use the editor and some other stuff"
1196880,1204160," so i think it's a good idea it's gonna be good idea okay so you can edit existing stuff and it asks"
1204160,1210400," you for a tour all right so i have an idea let me actually try to run this entire thing but without"
1210400,1216880," the cd-rom to confirm that uh you know we installed this entire thing correctly so i'm removing the cd-rom"
1216880,1225200," and i'm gonna just do that uh all right so it asks for this uh zoom to fit and uh i'm gonna just do that"
1225200,1230160," all right so it's loading compiler and uh there we go so it actually loads pretty much instantaneously"
1230160,1236880," update and compress the dictionary and whatnot uh and cross 24x thank you so much for gifting another"
1236880,1241280," subs thank you for gifted stuff i think it's like five subs thank you thank you thank you i really"
1241280,1250400," appreciate that so uh there is a lot of com uh like flags in here right as you can see so i'm thinking so"
1250400,1256960," maybe i should actually create some sort of a script uh to help me out to run this entire stuff so let's go"
1256960,1263600," ahead and do that i'm gonna do run dot sh and in here i'm gonna just like write a shell script uh"
1263600,1269760," right so i'm gonna copy paste this entire thing in here and also enable the tracing and the errors right"
1269760,1276800," so then i'm gonna do i'm gonna make it executable and now if i run this entire thing it just like does"
1276800,1286080," that and that's pretty convenient so i wonder um if i can just make it zoom to fit uh like right away um let"
1286080,1290880," me let me let me try to do that so i'm gonna copy paste this entire thing and i'm gonna try to do"
1290880,1301360," uh help uh right so this is gonna be help uh and can i do zoom uh um yeah"
1304720,1315520," qima zoom to fit right uh remember remember zoom to fit uh graphical screen does not fit in the"
1315520,1322720," screams that fit doesn't work with display uh gtk or something like that uh so there is a full screen"
1322720,1334480," option uh right so and it kind of corresponds to um to this one right so if i try to do"
1334720,1339840," like a full screen is it called full screen or is it looks like it's called full screen right"
1339840,1345520," if i do full screen it starts at full screen so this is a thing right so you can basically provide"
1345520,1353200," these options through the command line i wonder if i can do something like zoom to fit and it's not a"
1353200,1360800," thing zoom fit it's not a thing full screen is a thing but zoom to fit is not a thing um right"
1360800,1372720," that's actually kind of sad okay zoom to fit uh option um zoom to fit uh gtk uh zoom to fit default"
1372720,1380880," it's also suggest default uh to gtk options i wish there was like a list of all of the options but"
1380880,1390560," looks like uh it doesn't print everything right so full screen yeah uh full screen toggle full screen"
1390560,1396400," yeah i just like wish like give me the full list so i can just basically control effort and find what i"
1396400,1403520," want but it looks like it doesn't give me everything unfortunately uh right so they're talking about"
1403520,1409200," zoom to fit right so we're getting into the source code it's it's always a good sign when you're trying"
1409200,1415680," to find a user level feature and the only thing you can find is the development patches and diff it is"
1415680,1427200," always a good sign trust me it is very good sign uh so so zoom to fit uh it is an option grump a grab on hover um"
1427200,1436640," it doesn't really tell me how to enable that option though uh it doesn't really tell me uh"
1437520,1449520," zoom to fit uh command line maybe a command line uh to to command line uh change look"
1449520,1458800," display okay minus display jtk zoom to feed on and off holy that is so obvious that was so obvious"
1458800,1464560," thank you so much uh qmo developers very cool i really appreciate that and i didn't even find it like"
1464560,1468800," yeah it's somewhere in the changelogs uh all right so this is going to be something like own"
1468800,1476160," uh temple os is more intuitive than this yes thank you so much and uh yeah"
1476160,1483360," imagine that imagine the freaking temple os being well obviously it's more intuitive obviously"
1483360,1488400," it's created by the best programmer on planet earth obviously it's more intuitive like"
1488400,1495120," why would i even question that i'm sorry uh all right so let's do a run dot sh and uh let's add"
1495120,1502800," this option in here because i don't want to do that all the time uh 64 uh and can i just include that"
1502800,1510480," okay so this one has to be just on uh there we go right if i run that uh it's perfect so now we can do"
1510480,1518400," see as far as i know i remember wait a second i remember that you can even do boot right uh boot"
1518400,1526000," and you can say see this is something that i roughly remember uh no it you can't do that whatever uh cool"
1526000,1542800," so uh all right so what i'm interested in is editing and running programs right so uh this is what we"
1542800,1549840," need and my my camera actually you know covers uh covers everything so let's actually move my camera"
1549840,1556800," so behind my camera like i can't see behind the camera either right because behind the camera i have"
1556800,1565040," um a terminal right so i specifically put some something behind the camera so uh it forces me to"
1565040,1572320," organize my windows so you can see everything so it's kind of like intentionally uh right so it's a"
1572320,1578320," five head move to actually force me to organize everything so you can see everything all right"
1578320,1584800," so we're starting the tour now we're going to demonstrate how to work uh with programs we'll"
1584800,1591520," change to the uh slash demo slash games directory note that directories are specified with the forward"
1591520,1598480," slash not the backslash drives can be specified uh in a cd command and the boot drive is specified"
1598480,1604320," with colon colon uh malloc zone thank you so much for tier one subscription thank you thank you thank you"
1604320,1611120," and welcome to our epic temple club all right so uh uh enter to complete the command okay so the command"
1611120,1617280," here is cd and as far as i know each command in temple os is essentially like a c function right so"
1617280,1622960," we're actually calling to a c function we cd to this directory and then we uh print the files within that"
1622960,1631280," victory and that didn't work uh nice one and the reason why it didn't work is probably because i put"
1631280,1637200," the cursor at the beginning of the uh of the command like accidentally and if i press enter in here it"
1637200,1642160," it doesn't actually enter this entire thing and that broke that soft locked the entire tutorial"
1642160,1651520," uh just in case just in case i probably want to actually restart everything so let's actually restart"
1651520,1659600," just in case because who knows so uh all right so let's take a tour one more time and uh the editing and"
1659600,1670000," running of the program this is not the thing i wanted this is so annoying one more time take the tour uh take"
1670000,1676560," the tour and okay so it's kind of difficult because i need to first click to grab the mouse and i don't"
1676560,1682800," want to accidentally double click because it will start a wrong tutorial okay editing and running programs"
1682800,1688320," we started the uh the right tutorial don't press anything don't touch anything if you accidentally put a"
1688320,1695680," cursor here that breaks the tutorial okay press enter finally it worked cool now we're going to edit the"
1695680,1702080," file normally you will probably left click on the directory listing to edit a file but we're going to"
1702080,1708400," type it on the command line so i can't see in this mess but i think i can just do that and as you can see"
1708400,1713440," it suggests me to edit this specific file i'm opening this specific file and this is how it looks like"
1714240,1719840," all right so i can't see this stuff so i have to keep moving it around this is a first person shooter"
1719840,1726080," there is no main function in templeos programs any program program statements outside functions get"
1726080,1732800," executed when you uh include them at the command line uh the castle frankenstein statement at the bottom"
1732800,1740880," will run the program when the in when we include it okay that's cool uh press shift escape to abort the"
1740880,1747680," editor shift escape we aborted the editor okay now we're on the uh castle frankenstein hc uh program"
1747680,1752800," okay so this is how i can run it i can just include the entire file and there we go we have a we have a"
1752800,1760160," game running so this is the game uh move around with the cursor keys and press okay so i can move around and"
1760160,1767440," and stuff like that right so it's a 3d game it's a very uh triple a game i'm not gonna lie uh okay so"
1767440,1773040," then i can do shift escape so i notice the pattern in here so every time you want to quit something"
1773040,1778880," right you have to shift escape this entire thing right so okay uh the program is still in the memory"
1778880,1784400," and we can start it by typing custom frankenstein okay so basically it included the file it uh compiled"
1784400,1789840," everything and we now can use the functions from that program so i can run it again and i can uh quit"
1789840,1797760," it again okay so i can type a bunch of things uh and here i don't really care about them i suppose so i'm"
1797760,1806720," gonna press ok uh so now i can edit uh okay press f5 in the editor to run the file uh being edited this is"
1806720,1815280," something that i actually need right so f5 so this is what yeah there we go uh then press to kill the"
1815280,1822480," task and then can do shift escape to abort the application and ctrl alt x to kill the task okay"
1822480,1828480," so it still is still have task running uh that's pretty cool so this is probably one of the things"
1828480,1833840," like main things that we need we need to be able to cd between the directories and we need to be able to"
1833840,1840720," edit files and run the files right so i'm not sure if i need anything else from this tutorial right so i"
1840720,1848320," can now uh create programs and i can now just run them and quit so maybe that's that's enough uh to"
1848320,1855440," abort the editor okay explore the demo index you'll find on the menu it's arranged by difficulty hit space"
1855440,1863120," on the demo uh okay so i guess that's it right so that is basically it i can barely see the uh the"
1863120,1868560," crossing here so i'm gonna just close it and uh off we go so now we know how to do this kind of"
1868560,1875600," shit i'm in the home folder right uh so i want to create the i want to create the folder so i remember"
1875600,1881520," that i had like an auto completion thing yet let me actually restart the operating system when a doubt just"
1881520,1886560," just restart the whole thing uh because i do remember that i had auto completion uh somewhere"
1886560,1892320," here so let's not take a tour yeah there we go so this is the auto completion uh let me actually move my"
1892320,1900320," my thing down there right somewhere here so you can you can see everything and i'm gonna just move this"
1900320,1905520," into that stuff here because it's not particularly convenient that it's up there so i'm not kind of not"
1905520,1917600," used to that uh all right so can i create a folder make dear uh right uh so it's gonna be aoc 2021 uh and"
1917600,1925600," there we go uh so the apparently there is no such thing as make dear or something like that make dear"
1925600,1934240," okay so uh temple os i wonder if the google is gonna be useful this kind of stuff um make folder how do you"
1934240,1940480," make a folder uh how to make a directory or file and there's a whole subreddit there's an official"
1940480,1948720," subreddit for temple os do you make of course thank you terry very cool in all of the operating system"
1948720,1953280," including windows and unix it's make dear but of course here it's dear make because well i mean"
1953280,1962960," why would they question divine intellect uh dear make uh okay aoc uh 2021 uh all right and there we go"
1962960,1970800," so we can now cd to aoc uh 2021 uh and we're there so can i just do that and there we go we have"
1970800,1976480," everything so the next thing i want to do i want to create a simple hello world i suppose uh so i'm"
1976480,1984960," gonna do ed and i'm gonna say hello and if i remember correctly the extension for the uh holy c is hc"
1984960,1991520," so i'm gonna just use that and there we go we are in the text editor so i have no idea how to program it but"
1991520,1999440," roughly from some clips uh that are probably monica tos um right i remember that you have to do hello"
1999440,2006480," world like this you can just put hello world like a string and that will just work right uh right so and"
2006480,2010720," i can do something like f5 and there we go we have a hello world would you look at that that's actually"
2010720,2019600," super cool uh and then can i do shift escape cool so we wrote hello world would you look at that so"
2019600,2026800," how much time did it take us to actually go from like zero to hello world uh right so it took us half"
2026800,2033760," of an hour half of an hour like think about the usability of the operating system right well i mean"
2033760,2038720," i used the separating system before but it was like more than one year ago so i forgot everything"
2038720,2046560," uh right and now think about like how difficult it is to get into the linux right so how much time you"
2046560,2051680," have to spend to actually set up everything here i just installed this and think this thing and in half"
2051680,2059840," of an hour i have hello world easy freaking easy"
2059840,2067920," so let's try to actually do other things can i like have a loop"
2067920,2075520," for by the way can you see the like the programs that i'm typing because the the font is actually very"
2075520,2083440," small it's a font for ants and i'm not sure if i can increase it uh i wonder if i can uh so let me see"
2083440,2094480," can i just zoom in um um i don't think so no i don't think so no it's it's basically it but it's"
2094480,2102880," probably because it's uh yeah zoom to fit it's not even oh my god this is so bad right so it was not"
2102880,2109200," even checked in here i set this option outside of the ui and in the ui it was not even set even though"
2109200,2118720," logically in the program it was set anyway so uh can i just do like a classical thing like in c where i"
2118720,2127760," just iterate like 10 times um right and just print hello world 10 times uh i wonder if i can just do it"
2127760,2136240," like that uh okay so it's gonna be f5 and something went wrong something went horribly wrong let's see"
2136240,2138880," undefined identifier at i"
2138880,2147360," oh boy oh yeah you you don't have int or something like that uh i don't remember the types of temple of"
2147360,2153440," holy sea holy sea types let's take a look at types language is the analysis of holy sea"
2155040,2161200," there is an example of holy sea on rosetta code would you look at that the uh all right so"
2161200,2168800," holy sea uh okay so 100 doors i suppose it does have loops there so we can steal some stuff from this"
2168800,2179600," example uh let me oh my god why does it take so much time modern web modern web is unbearable like"
2181440,2193360," okay um so pages in the category hello c um not hello c holy c okay uh this is a really bad website holy"
2193360,2204640," uh all right so hello hello c holy c why do you keep saying this hello c all right okay so yeah you you have"
2204640,2213840," this like u8 i8 i64 or something like that and i think you cannot define them inside of four right"
2213840,2219040," i think you cannot define them inside of four but i'm not sure uh okay so i'm gonna try to use something"
2219040,2226400," like uh i64 and i'm gonna try to run the program and it still doesn't run so probably have to define"
2226400,2232000," uh the variable outside because i don't quite remember like uh again i used it very long time ago"
2232000,2237520," uh and there we go so we have a repeating hello world how about that how about that so maybe we"
2237520,2243200," can try to develop something more complicated like a fibonacci sequence and whatnot uh let's define two"
2243200,2247520," variables the first one is going to be zero the first fibonacci number and the second one is going to be"
2247520,2258800," one the second one and uh let's say that um while the first one is less than how much how how much we"
2258800,2268400," want to put there uh maybe one million uh one two three one two three right um we're gonna print that a"
2268400,2275600," so i'm gonna assume that this printing method where you just like um how to say that put a string as a"
2275600,2282080," statement and it just prints it it i would assume that it works like a printf right so uh i'm gonna just do"
2282080,2289840," d right and then maybe a new line in here uh and then uh just semicolon or something uh i wonder if"
2289840,2299600," i can just have i 64 c where i would do a plus b right so this is a plus b and then b will be equal to a"
2300240,2306560," uh right so i think i think it has to be this the other way around equal to b and b is going to be"
2306560,2312960," equal to c there we go and i wonder how can they remove uh like a whole line uh apparently i can't"
2312960,2317920," just remove the whole line so i will probably have to like learn how to use this text editor like off"
2317920,2325040," screen or something but i hope this is the code that will work so let's actually try to run it and it"
2325040,2330160," didn't like that uh because i forgot to actually provide the thing that i need to uh to run so let's"
2330160,2338560," actually put a in here can i run it and it kind of worked uh but yeah it didn't at the same time uh"
2338560,2344320," because i have no idea what the hell has happened right so i wonder what the has happened"
2344320,2348320," it only prints one and it loops forever"
2349840,2357360," oh boy uh so here's the zero here's the one uh here we do that until this thing is less than one"
2357360,2365680," million right then i try to print this thing uh all right and then c is equal a plus b which is going"
2365680,2374000," to be one right it's going to be one uh then i assign a to b to a which will make a one uh and then i"
2374000,2379760," said b to c which is going to be one so then on the next iteration it should be fine uh right so it's kind"
2379760,2386560," of weird so i'm thinking maybe i should actually define uh this thing somewhere here right so maybe"
2386560,2389440," i have to pre-define this entire stuff now it works"
2389440,2396640," oh my god we're off to a great start"
2396640,2406800," so if i define this variable in here this doesn't work for whatever freaking reason i have no idea why"
2407520,2411760," right so maybe it doesn't support like a scope defined variables or something like that that's"
2411760,2422560," fine but why does it compile then right and if i put this thing in here i64c uh it works i mean that's"
2422560,2427920," fine i can just define all of my variables at the top of the program and just use that like i just it's"
2427920,2435360," simply unclear why it wouldn't work uh right so i mean i'm not going to question the divine intellect right so"
2435360,2441200," it's definitely not a bug it is definitely not a bug it's probably a feature and there's probably a good"
2441200,2446000," divine reason behind that feature we just don't know that yet because we don't have a divine intellect"
2446640,2459280," uh all right so yeah"
2459280,2469280," uh 0007 that's fast this is probably because i'm we're using kvm right and i would presume that through kvm"
2469280,2475760," it's going to be like running on a native speed maybe i'm not really sure but yeah"
2475760,2480800," so we enabled kvm for for qvm so it should actually run pretty fast"
2480800,2488560," so that's pretty cool uh okay so i'm i'm super happy with what i see in here uh so maybe we should"
2488560,2496160," attempt to solve uh advent of code problem day one uh so i i suppose we have everything because we can"
2496160,2501840," just run things so should we try it should we just go ahead and try a problem uh let's go ahead and do"
2501840,2510960," that that okay uh so here is the first problem i've never seen i've never read that problem before so i'm"
2510960,2515200," opening this problem for the first time i probably should log in with my like github account or something"
2515760,2522080," so this is going to be my first impression first row and edited impression of the problem so is it"
2522080,2525840," going to be difficult is it going to be hard i don't know but since it's the first problem it's"
2525840,2530000," supposed to be relatively easy right so you know they're not going to start with something super"
2530000,2539200," difficult uh hopefully i don't freaking know uh we'll see uh so day one sonar sweep you're minding your"
2539200,2546560," own business on a ship at sea when the overboard alarm goes off you rush to see if you can help"
2546560,2553760," apparently one of the elves tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh keys flying into the ocean so before"
2553760,2561360," you know it you're inside a submarine the elves keep ready for a situation like this uh okay it's covered"
2561360,2568720," in christmas lights uh because of course it is and it even has an experimental antenna that should be able"
2568720,2576960," to track the keys if you can boost its signal strength high enough there is a little matter that indicates"
2576960,2585680," that uh the antenna signal strength by this uh by displaying zero five stars okay uh oh okay so"
2585680,2593440," every time you solve a problem the the strength is increasing so it's okay uh you're in your instincts"
2593440,2599280," tell you that in order to save christmas you will need to get all 50 stars by december 25th"
2600000,2605760," collect stars by solving puzzles two puzzles will be made available on each day in the advent calendar"
2605760,2611120," the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first each puzzle grants one star good luck"
2611120,2619280," uh so as the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean it automatically performs a sonar sweep"
2619280,2625520," of the nearby sea floor on a small screen the solar sweep report your puzzle input appears"
2626400,2632800," okay on a small screen the sonos will report your puzzle input appears each line is a measurement of"
2632800,2639280," the sea floor depth as the sweep oh shit we'll have to put a file into the temple os i forgot about"
2639280,2647120," that so the the input is probably going to be huge so we won't be able to just like oh fuck shit fuck damn"
2649760,2659280," uh all right um each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further"
2659280,2665760," away from the submarine for example suppose you had the following report right so we have this kind of"
2665760,2672720," shit uh this report indicates that scanning outwards for the submarine the sun or sweep found depth uh"
2673680,2679840," basically this depth right so it scans um outwards okay and so on the first order of the business is"
2679840,2685680," to figure out how quickly the depth increases just so you know what you're dealing with you never know"
2685680,2693440," if the keys will get carried into uh deeper water by an ocean current or a fish or something to do this"
2693440,2699440," count the number of times uh a depth uh measurement increased from the previous measurement this is"
2699440,2704720," actually pretty straightforward there is no measurement before the first measurement uh and in the example"
2704720,2709840," above the changes are the following okay so this increased increased decreased okay in this example"
2709840,2713680," there are seven measurements that are larger than the previous measurement how many measurements are larger"
2713680,2717440," than the previous measurements this is actually pretty straightforward but if i take a look at the"
2717440,2724640," input it's probably freaking huge uh right so i won't be able to just type it in into my into my thingy so"
2724640,2732320," i'll have to i have to find a way to maybe mount the current hard drive and just like do something do"
2732320,2742960," something with that so yeah i will have to figure it out it would be kind of cool if i could just download"
2742960,2750960," that but we don't have any uh internet access on the temple os unfortunately and i also have no idea how"
2750960,2755840," how to read files from the temple os but again so today's stream is just basically learning and setting"
2755840,2762160," up the development environment so that should be fine that should be fine uh okay so i'm gonna quickly"
2762160,2768320," close temple os and i'm gonna basically grab my file uh where is the where is this entire thing okay"
2768320,2772640," so let me actually bring it back in here and i'm gonna get my puzzle input"
2773360,2791840," so uh let me see so this is gonna be input txt right and i wonder where i wanna i'm gonna use ed"
2791840,2797920," because it's a little bit easier to do it this way uh right so then i just do that and uh then i save this"
2797920,2807440," this entire thing and then i just quit so input txt input txt so there we go cool uh vincent uh vincent"
2807440,2812400," hawkes thank you so much for tier one subscription thank you thank you thank you and welcome to our epic"
2812400,2818320," temple os club all right so the real question is uh can you just like take this piece of and mount"
2818960,2828400," uh that's the real question uh so it is a dos mbr boot sector partition so maybe we can just mount that"
2828400,2838320," thing can i go ahead and mount it all right so we create mnt and mount uh aoc 2021 mnt uh and uh"
2838320,2843440," do i have to do suda because i'm mounting it on a user space right so maybe i can do that without the"
2843440,2851760," so the only rule can do that okay so cool uh so uh okay so it says some bullshit that i cannot see"
2851760,2858320," wrong fs type bad option bad super block on def loop zero missing code page or help program or other"
2858320,2866960," errors so everything's bad what an error message holy everything's wrong everything's wrong everything's"
2866960,2875520," bad no you cannot do that no no bad bad error error holy that's very intense error uh okay so"
2875520,2885680," um temple uh temple os qima row image i think we're using qima row image"
2885680,2893600," uh so and uh like mount maybe linux mount right linux mount we'll see"
2895200,2904080," uh so mounting row or q cow uh q image but we don't have a q cow i think i didn't create"
2904080,2909200," uh specifically q cow right so maybe we'll have to create a q cow"
2909200,2919440," we'll see we'll see uh support center hpe.com that doesn't even load very cool very very cool"
2922320,2932640," go away uh next one how to mount a qima virtual disk image okay uh so let's say you discover critical"
2932640,2938960," business data in a legacy dos spreadsheet file and excel can't read the file if the legacy program"
2938960,2945200," originally run on dos you might boot a copy of free dos and install the legacy program there to extract"
2945200,2950560," the uh or export the uh or export the data or to a common file format like a comma separated csv file"
2950560,2956480," you can follow our instructions to install and boot free dos using quma virtual machine okay"
2956480,2962640," you can mount a quma disk image using two basic methods using an offset to mount the image directly"
2962640,2967360," or using the uh lib guest lib guest fs tool package"
2969760,2978080," that sounds interesting so uh using an offset linux linux can mount qema's raw image uh disk image"
2978080,2984400," raw disk image format assuming it knows where to find the start of the c drive this is very interesting"
2984400,2991360," partition on the virtual disk virtual disk can contain multiple partitions but for most legacy operating"
2991360,2997600," system installations like dos you probably only have one partition this is the c drive let's look at the"
2997600,3003120," output from the linux f disk command using the minus l option uh using the minus l option uh using the minus l"
3003120,3010560," option will list uh the partitions on the virtual disk okay so let's give it a try i suppose it's going"
3010560,3019600," to be f disk f disk minus l aoc and it doesn't autocomplete why it doesn't autocomplete because i don't"
3019600,3026240," have a f disk okay i have no idea i think like it should be available on all of the installations and"
3027920,3033840," it's already installed thank you debian very cool and i know exactly what the f is going on"
3033840,3041920," right because it's available in sbin because it's supposed to be like the administrator level tool"
3041920,3048800," right so and it's put in sbin and it's only available when you do uh suda but outside of suda it doesn't"
3048800,3055200," work and it's actually a very common theme in debian right i encountered a lot of problems because of this"
3055200,3062960," debian mentality and i've even seen a lot of like workarounds in like applications uh because of that"
3062960,3069680," mentality like it's a really weird decision but this is debon for you for whatever freaking reason so yeah"
3069680,3075680," so we have to do it like that i suppose can you can just do that uh and it still doesn't autocomplete"
3075680,3081120," properly but at least it works like f disk doesn't have to be run at suda right so what if i have like a"
3081120,3088800," user level image that i want to run it on so yeah you have to do that explicitly um all right so what"
3088800,3098480," do we have in here um i wonder what is an offset though uh so here is uh some partition i suppose maybe"
3098480,3111040," this is the offset uh right so this could be the offset 63 uh okay uh cool here the c drive is the"
3111040,3118320," first and only partition on the on the virtual drive listed as image image one to determine the offset of"
3118320,3125440," the c drive you need to know the starting sector of that partition the output from f disk shows this as 63."
3125440,3132720," it's also 63 in our case maybe that's the offset okay so calculate the offset you also uh you also"
3132720,3140160," need to know the sector size the virtual disk image has sectors of uh 112 bytes right so do we what do we"
3140160,3148960," know what the sector size um i'm not really sure so i suppose maybe uh yeah so sectors it's also it's it's"
3148960,3154000," the same essentially it's the same numbers actually you calculate the offset uh as the protocol the offset and"
3154000,3160640," sector and there we go you have this thing um okay use the offset value to mount the virtual disk so i"
3160640,3166400," suppose we can just literally use the same thing at least try uh and see how it goes so we need to"
3166400,3174480," create a folder tmp dos and then mount loop offset uh blah blah blah tmp dos and then ls sounds doable"
3174480,3181040," sounds doable maybe we'll be able to do that okay so can i just like uh i already have mnt uh mount"
3181760,3189440," uh to do loop uh to do all loop offset right i'm gonna literally use the same offset uh we actually"
3189440,3196000," had two partitions in here as you can see uh but i'm gonna just ignore that one and maybe try to mount"
3196000,3203920," that one later right so if the first one doesn't work we can try to mount that one uh so because in"
3203920,3209760," in case of this one i don't have to do any work at all so should be fine uh and uh then what i need to"
3209760,3216800," do aoc and uh mnt right so i'm mounting it to mnt and of course you have to be uh root and it worked"
3218000,3223680," it didn't even complain what a"
3223680,3229120," holy holy i mounted i actually mounted"
3229120,3237520," this just worked so yeah so if you're interested in how to do that i'm going to put that in description i"
3237520,3247520," suppose right so i have to put that in references okay uh how to mount the uh temple os uh disco i"
3247520,3253360," suppose right so yeah that was actually pretty useful and it doesn't didn't even require to do anything"
3253360,3259600," uh so that's pretty pug for everyone who's interested so this is a good tutorial right this is a good"
3259600,3267440," tutorial uh okay so let me see it has root access right so i'm not sure if we'll be able to just edit"
3267440,3275200," it manually but we'll see uh okay so here's the home and we have aoc uh aoc can i just create something"
3275200,3282800," like uh hello mom uh i cannot do that right so if i do sue the hello mom i managed to create hello mom"
3282800,3289440," and the real question here is when i go and um you know run the temple os i suppose i will have to"
3289440,3296160," to maybe unmount it first right uh so let's actually do it like this run dot sh and i'm gonna"
3296160,3301920," try to run it will it work that's the real question it kind of worked but i'm kind of scared"
3301920,3309280," to actually modify it can i like have it mounted and modified it from the virtual machine simultaneously"
3309280,3315760," that's the real question here so will it break a lot of shit because so far qema doesn't complain"
3315760,3321600," so everything seems to be fine so let's give it a try so here is the deer maybe i have to put this"
3321600,3326720," thing i'm gonna go into aoc and by the way the cool thing about temple os is that i can just click on the"
3326720,3332480," folders right i don't have to use the con and here we go we have a hello mom uh would you look at that"
3332480,3340400," uh just a second i need to ah oh boy uh okay so and then i have to do it like that there we go so we have a"
3340400,3349200," hello mom so let's actually try to edit hello mom uh not a text file that is very interesting i cannot"
3349200,3354400," just like edit it for whatever freaking reason maybe this is because it doesn't have an extension"
3354400,3360000," huh that could be the case okay so let me let me see what we can do about that"
3361280,3372880," uh so home aoc aoc 2021 and i'm gonna try to move hello mom to hello mom txt i'm gonna use the capital"
3372880,3378960," letters just in case uh right we're gonna do suda and i'm gonna go back uh and i'm gonna try to run that"
3378960,3387200," maybe it just wants a specific extension uh all right so let's do it like this and i'm gonna do a"
3387200,3399360," deer aoc aoc uh okay so it still has hello mom and can i click on that thing it still says not a text file"
3399360,3407360," which is a shame i think uh which is kind of oh it still opened it it just like threw a warning"
3408480,3417680," but it's still open it okay uh so now i'm gonna try to do the following thing i'm gonna say hello from"
3417680,3425040," god's temple right hello from god's temple how do you save everything uh i forgot how you save files in"
3425040,3435600," the text editor temple os editor save file every very brief okay uh"
3438000,3445920," uh save save changes control c okay so we can just do control c i suppose all right did it save it"
3445920,3452560," hopefully so if i try to open it one more time will it be there uh not the text file okay and it's still"
3452560,3457280," there okay everything seems to be fine now i'm going to close this entire thing and i'm going to go into"
3457280,3465680," mnt uh all right so home advent of code and i'm going to do cut hello txt there is nothing there"
3465680,3473520," so we didn't actually save anything didn't actually save anything which is kind of such maybe uh this"
3473520,3481440," is because uh we have to unmount at first right so to make the changes visible i have a feeling that we"
3481440,3492800," have to unmount at first right uh all right so let's do you mount mnt uh huh okay cool so if i take a look at mnt"
3492800,3497040," right now so it's completely unmounted and let's run this into i think one more time"
3497040,3509920," uh to do to control scene uh control s not c i'm russian uh in russian language c is a s letter and"
3509920,3515680," my brain actually confuses them i press control s don't worry about it uh i just said as control c"
3517120,3525360," anyway so uh yeah russians confuse these letters all the time don't worry about it so but i press the"
3525360,3532800," right one i do remember that okay so here's the hello txt and okay now it is working uh hello world and i'm"
3532800,3540640," gonna press ctrl s i'm pressing ctrl s hopefully right and if i try to open it one more time"
3540640,3548800," it is there okay pressing ctrl s uh and uh now i'm gonna do it like this okay so i need to mount it one"
3548800,3559280," more time uh probably want to actually save this command uh somewhere right so i do i want to save sudo as well"
3560160,3567680," yeah i'm gonna save sudo as well uh let's create mount sh right so mount s this is not what i wanted"
3567680,3578560," to copy actually uh all right so uh i wanted to copy this thing uh and bin sh set xe all right cool"
3579120,3586080," oh it would be also kind of cool to uh to have a script that also installs and creates this image"
3586080,3590800," right so we have a script that installs and create the image we're gonna have a script that runs the"
3590800,3596320," machine and we have a script that mounts the hard drive so we can put something in there and i might"
3596320,3603040," as well actually share all of these scripts uh you know public in github or github or whatever right so"
3603040,3608800," yeah i think yeah so we have something to share today that's actually pretty cool uh all right"
3608800,3618800," uh ch mod plus mount mount sh right and i'm gonna just try to do mount and it's mounted the thing um"
3618800,3628560," right and i'm gonna go into the mount uh so home uh aoc aoc hello mom and if i take a look at hello mom"
3628560,3635200," there we go hello world and at the end we have e whatever is that supposed to mean it's maybe some"
3635200,3643680," sort of like a special ending for uh for temple us i don't know so no end lines though it's kind of weird"
3643680,3649760," add unmount mnt on start that's actually a good idea"
3655040,3662960," forcing um all right so at least we can exchange information between the uh between the virtual"
3662960,3670800," machines and stuff like that okay so i'm gonna try to copy um input right where is the input do i have"
3670800,3680000," the input um so here is the input and i'm gonna copy it in here right so it's gonna be suda and we've got"
3680000,3690880," the we've got the input all right"
3690880,3700240," and you mount uh mnt but i'm gonna do you mount automatically maybe a little bit later"
3700240,3705840," okay so if i do ls uh mnt right so we'll get that and if i'm gonna try to run this thing"
3706480,3715440," and let's go ahead and do that all right take a tour no uh i'm gonna cd i'm gonna just do that i'm"
3715440,3724160," gonna use the mouse we're in 2021 uh and if i try to edit the input txt uh what we're gonna have in"
3724160,3732080," here not a text file are you sure about that buddy okay so here's the input from the website so we got the"
3732080,3739600," input from the website into the into the system that's pretty cool i wonder if i can uh rename"
3739600,3746240," the entire thing so there should be some sort of a command that called that is called m v or maybe move"
3746240,3754320," okay there is a move command so and let me see uh it takes a move file from one location to another uh or"
3754320,3761360," rename uh that's actually a pretty cool implementation look at that look at that it just copies and delete the previous one"
3762080,3772080," so though on operating systems like linux moving is faster than copying because i presume because"
3772080,3778160," of the file system right the only thing it changes is just changes the inode information right and that's"
3778160,3784320," why moving is usually like instantaneous within the single file system but here if you have a huge file"
3784960,3789280," to move file from one location to another one it's it's gonna literally copied by by byte"
3789280,3794880," but i'm not sure it depends on how copy is implemented it's actually a very interesting question"
3794880,3804160," so and if i do copy right so here's the copy i can try to look into the copy all right and copy is uh all right"
3805760,3812720," so yeah it copies stuff it copies chunks and stuff like that i suppose right copy file if the name ends"
3812720,3819760," uh in z it will be stored compressed if not dot z it will be stored uncompressed um i really like how"
3819760,3826800," self-explorable temple os is right i have a command i cannot only look up the documentation of the command i"
3826800,3834480," can see the implementation of the command how cool is that it's like it's almost like using emacs it's like"
3834480,3842000," if emacs was an actual operating system like an actual kernel and instead of uh elisp you had a"
3842000,3847280," holy c that's actually so cool i really like the self-explored systems right where you can just like"
3847280,3851040," take take it apart and see how it works and stuff like that it's really really cool"
3851760,3859440," um all right so uh what i want you to do i want you to actually move uh inputs um right"
3859440,3870480," so this is move uh input txt and i just wanted to move it to uh input txt capital thingy right so if i"
3870480,3877520," take take a look at this now right uh i should be able to just open it and it doesn't complain about"
3877520,3884720," not being text okay that is very cool um so the next thing i want to do i want to be able to"
3884720,3890560," like open a file and read from file the question is how do you do that in holy c this is something that"
3890560,3900000," we'll have to learn um so terry was a great guy his mental condition got to him yeah so it's actually"
3900000,3906080," really really freaking sad he's a genius but yeah so and again i just i just want to mention if you"
3906080,3913520," consider if you're thinking to donate me to support me this month instead of donating to me consider"
3913520,3919920," supporting the charities that are listed in the templeos website uh right so if you go to the to the"
3919920,3925680," official website of templeos at the bottom of the templeos um right there is a couple of charities in"
3925680,3934800," here so i really recommend to donate there instead um all right so let me see so uh luckily there is a lot of"
3934800,3939200," information out there there is like a community around the separating system so we can try to google"
3939200,3948480," up how to read file uh holy c read file can we find any useful information on that uh x86 64"
3948480,3954800," linux assembly reading files uh the language bars test holy c is set up i'd love to see who is supported to"
3954800,3966160," linux function product uh complete uh conquer dance uh holy holy scriptures okay so that's that's kind"
3966160,3973920," of it's kind of interesting uh all right so let me let me think so some of the things we can do actually"
3973920,3983200," we can try to guess how the functions are called right so i suppose maybe the function is called open uh right"
3983200,3996080," open file or maybe file uh open right uh no they're not called like that uh so there's a file there's a file"
3996080,4007360," write and file read right but i suppose they accept oh that's actually super cool read the whole file from disk"
4009200,4015280," this is not bad this is not bad maybe that's what i need so it just allows me to read the whole file"
4015280,4020800," from from disk and returns it as a string and the question is does it is it null terminated or something"
4020800,4027920," like that um yeah we can just do that and we can just parse it myself um that'll be actually kind of cool"
4029680,4034080," so"
4034080,4040240," so file right file read so yeah"
4040240,4051520," let me see uh is there any functions for working with strings string uh str str str len estera copy strcmp"
4052080,4059840," uh strchr maybe something like str chr there's no such thing so maybe some of these string uh functions"
4059840,4067520," i'll have to like actually write myself but anyway so uh let's go ahead and uh create a file day one"
4067520,4076720," right so ed day zero one hc uh right i'm gonna open the first day and uh one of the things i want to try to"
4076720,4083840," do i want to do i want to maybe um file uh read right i'm reading the file and the file that i want"
4083840,4090080," to read i want to read uh input txt right so this is the input txt file i suppose it doesn't accept"
4090080,4100000," anything else uh right uh everything else here is optional uh so we have size in here uh oh it will"
4100000,4105840," return you the size of the okay this is something that we actually want right so you can read the file"
4105840,4112000," and it will also return you the size of that file uh jag fellow i hope i'm pronouncing the nickname"
4112000,4115920," correctly thank you so much for twitch prime television thank you thank you thank you and welcome to our epic"
4115920,4124320," temple club uh so here somebody on on youtube asked me a very good question how many epic clubs do"
4124320,4134800," i have i have a lot of them actually uh so all right uh let me let me see what we've got uh so i'm definitely gonna"
4134800,4139440," spend some time getting used to this operating system off screen right so i'm gonna maybe"
4139440,4144480," go through more tutorials and stuff like that uh because i want to get comfortable because i'm gonna"
4144480,4150000," be developing in it for the entire month so it's not particularly convenient so it will return the size"
4150000,4158480," it will turn the attributes and stuff like that uh okay so size is i64 right i64 size we're gonna put it in"
4158480,4166400," here so and i'm gonna provide it in here so here's the size and we're gonna print something like uh size"
4166400,4176080," of input txt input txt is uh i suppose i can just put d in here and i hope it will just work but i'm not"
4176080,4185600," 100% sure so let's actually do f5 and it couldn't do that file not found input txt okay so it couldn't"
4185600,4193360," find that file for whatever reason even though it's right there so maybe i have to put like a dot slash or"
4193360,4199840," a dot slash or something to be able to actually read this entire thing uh wait a second wait so just"
4199840,4214080," ah uh deer like this so this is a day one uh day one uh and let me try so i suppose it is very important to do"
4214080,4226400," something like this okay file not found uh so is it backslashes i think it's forward slashes right um so"
4226400,4234240," add whole path i do i really have to is there like a relative path in there in there um so it's kind of i"
4234240,4245360," i can try i mean sure c slash uh home uh right so but i'm not sure uh control s and i'm gonna do it"
4245360,4253600," like that so home oh it is running in yeah i see i see what's going on that's really weird why would it"
4253600,4262720," why would it run in home though um i mean i can just copy the input txt to home"
4263840,4270720," uh right so can i just do something like this uh okay so would copy it in there and if i do deer"
4270720,4282080," like this uh we do have the txt file in there if i open it like that and if i do f5 it actually worked"
4282080,4289920," uh so when it says uh the input of txt is this and then i forgot to put uh a new line in there so i"
4289920,4295680," think i have to put a new line in here so i do this uh size of this thing is basically nine kilobytes so"
4295680,4300880," it managed to read the whole thing uh thank you so much mcq8 for tier one subscription thank you thank"
4300880,4307120," you thank you thank you uh what i'm thinking is that like is there like a built-in features built-in"
4307120,4312880," things for parsing files or do i have to implement everything myself uh i don't mind implementing"
4312880,4320880," everything myself but it would be kind of cool if there was something uh so i can try to uh see scan"
4320880,4329120," f scan uh so there's a scan character scan key or some stuff like that so it's not what i think it is"
4329760,4340400," uh right bars uh so there's the str okay the cool thing here is that we can try to go into these"
4340400,4348000," functions and it will lead us to a file uh right so this it's a part of the kernel um it will lead us"
4348000,4359760," to a file that contains other related functions uh so we have str len uh uh string length and i suppose"
4359760,4370480," it's like null terminated so it's not what i think it is um so read the ports uh so there's a swap"
4371760,4376560," uh maximum and stuff like that so there's a lot of like useful functions and whatnot"
4376560,4383760," so one of this okay i can parse it myself but i need a function that converts a string to an integer"
4383760,4397280," can i do a to i uh a to uh maybe s to i so i just don't know how terry would call that str to uh okay"
4397280,4404960," so i'm gonna just assume that it just doesn't exist so all right uh str to okay thank you thank you so"
4404960,4413520," much str uh to i64 okay that's actually perfect so and the question is what does it accept uh it accept"
4413520,4424000," probably no terminates think oh it acts okay it acts like str2d uh right so it even has an end pointer and"
4424000,4430240," what not all right so i i do know what the fuck is going on in here this is actually super convenient"
4430240,4439360," so we can try to use that right so we we read the whole file into the buffer right then uh we can just"
4439360,4445520," use this function to constantly read the next uh the next number right we constantly read the next number"
4445520,4452720," and uh we advance until we reach the end or something like that so yep i think that's a good idea"
4452720,4458480," uh though it's kind of sad that file read doesn't put like a new line at the end but"
4458480,4468400," all right so you know what i think i want to make a small break because i've been programming for i've been"
4468400,4472880," setting this entire thing up for how much for for an entire hour so let's actually make a small break"
4472880,4477680," and after the break we're going to try to parse that file and once we manage to parse that file we"
4477680,4482960," will try to solve the problem right so the only thing we need to do we need to get that data into the"
4482960,4489840," holy scene what am i drinking i'm drinking earl a gay tea uh okay let's make a small break and"
4490880,4498480," right so let's go ahead and try to parse the entire file and see how it goes uh so file read will return"
4498480,4505120," the string i suppose this string is written like this can i just extend the entire i can actually do"
4505120,4514320," that that's actually pretty cool uh so this is going to be str right so here is the str uh and i wish i"
4514320,4522240," could just like um delete the lines somehow but i don't remember so there was like a cheat sheet for"
4522240,4533280," the editor somewhere uh so this is how you do that cheat sheet uh to to to to uh temple as editor uh cheat"
4533280,4544160," sheet any cheaters in the chat forcing cd uh all right so i don't know i don't know maybe"
4544160,4548080," maybe i'll just have to go through the tutorial one more time but i don't want to spend time on that"
4548080,4560720," um all right so i suppose uh str to i64 right so it accepts also end pointer and we need to keep doing"
4560720,4567680," this thing until we reach the end of this entire stuff all right until we reach the end of this entire"
4567680,4572160," stuff but that is really tricky uh that is really tricky"
4574000,4583280," so how does it determine the end uh right so while true uh if we encounter that that and that"
4583280,4593280," so i just want to see if it tries to identify like uh zero or null terminator of some sort"
4593280,4594320," uh"
4594320,4601440," a continue so it's one of those i don't see the null terminator though"
4602720,4610000," uh white spaces okay it removes the white spaces and whatnot so it's going to be minus"
4610000,4617280," this and zero and if it's something else you do that uh if radix that"
4617280,4630080," oh maybe it doesn't even need to do the zero thing it doesn't even need to do that because it stops and at any"
4630080,4635120," non-digit or something that doesn't fit into the definition of the number it doesn't even need to"
4635120,4640240," check for the null termination okay that makes sense i don't know why i brain farted so much in this"
4640240,4644720," uh so an anonymous user gifted a tier one sub to terry a davis temple"
4644720,4652640," thank you so much an anonymous user for gifting a sub to terry a davis as far as i know it's an account that"
4652640,4659840," actually like streams the archive of terry uh developing temple os right i think so yeah"
4659840,4667120," thank you so much for for gifting itself uh right i i think it's an official one even or something depends"
4667120,4671600," on the definition of official in that particular case so yeah thank you thank you so much"
4673200,4680720," uh all right so and i suppose the input txt actually also ends with the new line hopefully right it should"
4680720,4687760," end with the new line and that is how we're gonna know that uh we reach the end right so um all right"
4688800,4700480," um that makes sense it kind of makes sense uh so i 64 so we provide the str then i provide the radix and"
4700480,4707680," then i need to provide the pointer to the ends right so we need to keep track uh of the end uh u8 this is"
4707680,4714320," the end and that's the pointer to the end so end seems to be a keyword so maybe i'm not allowed to"
4714320,4719920," use that as just in case i'm going to put end p in here uh and i'm going to use end p in here so"
4719920,4729040," i'm not going to initialize this thing okay cool so str uh is going to do that and now i need to establish"
4729040,4737520," uh i need to establish the um the loop right up until what point i'm going to loop that is very"
4737520,4747920," very very interesting question up until what point uh because um so we sort of like advance this thing"
4747920,4757120," uh endpoint becomes a new stuff so we can do something like while size is greater than zero"
4757120,4765360," right while size is greater than zero uh we're gonna try to do that and i'm gonna just assign it to x and x is"
4765360,4772480," i64 right so this is basically the x um right and then uh and"
4772480,4782080," we can take the end p and subtract the string and that essentially gives us how much of the characters"
4782080,4790640," how many characters we consumed which we can quite easily subtract from the size right so yeah and that's"
4790640,4799680," how we update the loop and hopefully that will work maybe uh so there will be some problems uh with like"
4799680,4807760," and um the the new lines and stuff like that but maybe we can just adjust this condition maybe up until"
4807760,4816560," uh size is greater than one uh if it becomes one we know that only one new line left so yeah maybe that's going to be the case"
4816560,4822880," so and on each thing uh i'm going to just print that number right so i'm going to just do uh"
4822880,4831440," d new line x and hopefully this is a sufficient uh sufficient program to actually parse everything"
4831440,4838880," so let's try to run this thing and it didn't work and well at least it parsed the first character right it"
4838880,4846240," parsed the first character uh and uh let me see what we can do about that i forgot to assign end pointer"
4846240,4854160," to the str so as the end pointer is the new str str equal and p so and this is how we're gonna actually"
4854160,4861600," do this entire thing and we parsed all the numbers i suppose so uh some of them became like zero or"
4861600,4867440," something right you see i think this is precisely the problem i was talking about right it's the problem"
4867440,4873920," of the last uh character so i think we can try to solve that by basically uh rising it to one and if i"
4873920,4880160," try to run it one more time there we go we don't have any extra characters so the last one was 83 41."
4880160,4885920," let me actually confirm that it's 83 41. okay so that's fine uh i think we managed to parse all of"
4885920,4891120," the characters believe it or not that was actually pretty easy uh and it's kind of cool that they can"
4891120,4896560," just read the whole file into the memory and that's it i wonder if i have to free this entire thing um"
4896560,4904560," because maybe every time i run this program it leaks a little bit of memory but uh we're in 2021"
4904560,4913520," just buy more ram okay let it leak let it leak let it leak oh let it leak"
4913520,4925920," memory costs nothing let it leak okay so i think uh according to the definition of the problem we don't"
4925920,4934720," even have to um store that array right so we can just like store the previous value right we just need"
4934720,4939200," to store the previous value and we need to count how many times like uh this thing increased"
4939200,4948640," uh to do to um all righty let's go ahead and do that i'm a little bit nervous i'm a little bit nervous"
4949760,4955520," i can actually take a look at the implementation of file reads maybe uh there's something uh said there"
4955520,4966720," uh about uh memory stuff uh so this window is really annoying and i have a constant urge to close it"
4966720,4972480," but at the same time it is extremely useful because it shows auto completion and i'm just afraid that if i"
4972480,4980720," close it i won't know how to bring it back so it is really really scary like i hate this window but at"
4980720,4986000," the same time it provides the useful information so i'm just going to keep it in here and just like suffer"
4986000,4995680," uh so i hate it anyway so does it allocate any memory all right so it uses like free free um"
4998240,5005840," so if there is a function free okay here is the malloc here is the malloc uh-huh so this is the res"
5005840,5014240," and what it returns uh it returns the res which it actually malloced uh defense subscribe with uh tier"
5014240,5020720," one subscription for 15 months thank you thank you so much and welcome to epic temple us club okay so it"
5020720,5028080," uses malloc right it uses malloc uh and uh malloc just allocates some stuff right and then you have to"
5028080,5034240," free it so according to my understanding according to my limited understanding uh we probably have to"
5034240,5041680," do free str but the problem here is that we lost str right we kind of lost it so i think i'm going to"
5041680,5048640," actually create like a separate variable this is going to be start um okay maybe i'm going to call it begin"
5048640,5057920," instead begin okay so that's fine and then i'm going to just assign you str to begin and then i'm going to do the parsing"
5057920,5063840," right so i'm doing the parsing and then i'm going to free free the begin right okay so that way we're"
5063840,5069360," not going to leak any precious memory to be fair i just realized that we are in a virtual machine"
5069360,5073680," right we are in virtual machine that means we probably want to free the memory right"
5073680,5082080," alt w will open out a complete window okay so thank you thank you so much uh so if i try to do the uh"
5083280,5090400," gebaited by the chat uh and it didn't do anything it it doesn't open the autocomplete window you"
5090400,5100240," literally just debated me i should not listen to the chat chat gebaited yet again um it doesn't bring it"
5100240,5107200," back it doesn't bring it back anyway so you know what you have to do in this particular case"
5108080,5111680," you know what you have to do in this particular case you reset the whole operating system"
5111680,5120320," never listening to chat ever again uh that's for sure so let's not take the tour uh and uh let me"
5120320,5130960," take a look uh this thing and aoc aoc aoc day one we didn't lose uh anything so i'm gonna f5 and"
5130960,5136480," everything's fine at least nothing crashed well to be fair if something crashes within temple os your"
5136480,5143440," entire operating system crashes so you wouldn't know right so that's that's fine uh okay so we need to"
5143440,5150160," probably define some sort of a counter right so this is going to be the answer uh right so this is the"
5150160,5161600," answer and i really don't like that ants is already taken uh 0x grant 27 um gifted donated i suppose 100"
5161600,5165840," bits thank you so much for 100 bits i really appreciate that so this is the answer and this"
5165840,5173920," is initially going to be zero uh also what i want to do i want to store a previous value right we're going"
5173920,5178640," to have uh is 64 and we're going to store the previous one but here's an interesting thing at"
5178640,5184320," first we don't have a previous value so i think we're going to indicate the lack of a previous"
5184320,5188880," value as minus one so this is going to be like a negative saying that there is no previous value or"
5188880,5193520," anything like that uh okay so in here instead of printing this entire thing what we're going to do"
5194400,5204240," uh what we're going to do if previous is greater or equal than zero and x um okay so x is greater uh than"
5204240,5212160," the previous right then we're going to uh take the answer and increment that answer right and after"
5212160,5219440," that uh after that i'm gonna assign uh x to the previous right so i parse this entire thing uh then i"
5219440,5225360," basically analyzed it and then i advanced the the rest of the stuff so after that uh i should be able"
5225360,5233680," to print the answer so let's go it's going to be zero d and uh answer uh there we go if i try to run"
5233680,5243440," this entire thing it's 1581 is that a correct answer is that a correct answer i don't know i have no idea 1581"
5246080,5251040," first try mother flipper how about that freaking first try"
5251040,5264400," cool uh so yeah we actually did it i didn't expect that holy that's cool so let's take a look at the"
5264400,5274160," part two um part two electric boogaloo oh boy this already sounds like fun uh considering every single"
5274160,5280480," measurement isn't as useful as you expected there is just too much noise in the data instead consider"
5280480,5290960," the sums of a three measurement sliding window again considering the above example a a b a b c a b c d"
5290960,5298960," and uh okay so it also like rolls around or something um so three measurement window okay"
5298960,5305040," start by comparing uh the first and second three measurement window"
5305040,5313120," oh start by comparing the first and second three measurement window the measurement in the first"
5313120,5326160," window are marked a uh 20 28 their sum is 607 the second window is 20 28 20 uh huh the sum of the"
5326160,5331200," measurement in the second one is larger than the sum of the first so the first comparison increased"
5331200,5337200," your goal now is to count the number of times the sum of the measurements in this sliding window"
5337200,5346480," increases from the previous sum so compare a with b then compare b with c then c with d and so on"
5346480,5352000," stop when there aren't enough measurements left to create a new three measurement window so basically we have a"
5352000,5360080," rolling window of three elements and we just like go and see if something increases or not uh the sum of"
5360080,5365840," each measurement uh window is as full okay in the example the five sums uh that are larger than the"
5365840,5371520," previous sum blah blah blah how many sums are larger than the previous sum looks reasonable"
5371520,5381920," reasonable"
5381920,5384720," so 19"
5384720,5388000," then 20 28 10"
5388000,5398160," so i i do understand what this text is saying i do understand it i don't understand this graphics the"
5398160,5410560," the fuck is going on in here like seriously like yeah what okay uh a b uh a b c so how does that"
5410560,5418880," correspond to whatever is written in here um all right and then this basically remove that and all right"
5420640,5430240," a c like why is it written in such a weird way so what this is so weird like i like it doesn't even"
5430240,5438160," explain this explains it but this is doesn't it doesn't make any sense um it shows the position of each"
5438160,5445040," window it shows the position of each window where position where"
5447280,5451760," it's bizarre this is the most bizarre graphic i've ever seen okay so anyway let's actually try to call"
5451760,5459680," that uh all right so what do we have in here i suppose we need to do the same process right so but"
5459680,5463840," we have to just have a different thing in here so what i'm thinking is that i'm going to wrap this"
5463840,5471680," entire stuff into uh its own function uh u0 and this is going to be basically part one uh right so i'm"
5471680,5478720," going to just rub this entire thing into part one uh huh there we go uh and i'm not going to actually"
5478720,5489120," call this part one um right if i try to run this thing uh it doesn't do anything that's cool uh but"
5489120,5494880," if i do part one like so i don't even have to provide the parenthesis right so it it prints the answer in"
5494880,5502080," here uh might as well actually maybe do something like uh part one and just print it like that and"
5502080,5508240," does it work yes it does in fact work so now i should be able to do something like this uh comment it out"
5508240,5519520," and do part two electric boogaloo uh you zero uh part two right i'm gonna do it like that so i"
5519520,5522560," literally need the same process pretty much um"
5529680,5538640," so uh now uh can i just copy paste this entire thing uh i should be able to so the reason why"
5538640,5543280," my code looks like is not because i'm a bad programmer i mean i'm a bad programmer but that's"
5543280,5547520," not the reason uh the reason is because i don't know how to use this text editor i wish there was"
5547520,5553280," like a way to auto indent everything but i don't want to go for each individual line so that's why i just"
5553280,5559120," don't indent this entire thing uh i'm gonna try to press ctrl c and then ctrl v and it copy-paste the whole"
5559120,5564560," thing okay that's actually pretty cool so uh all right so we have something like previous in here"
5564560,5566720," and so on and so forth"
5566720,5580320," so maybe we want to kind of like a predefined window right so when we're starting with this thing right"
5580320,5587280," when we're starting with this thing we need to do like um three iterations to build up the window"
5587280,5595040," if you know what i'm talking about right uh so that's what we need to do that's what we need to"
5595040,5602880," do oh by the way can i just do like this where i press ctrl x and then uh just put it like that okay"
5602880,5609520," so i can move lines around that is that is actually pretty convenient so i really like that uh so here"
5610960,5616560," we have we basically take the next value and we update the state and here we evaluate the value"
5616560,5625280," so essentially what i want to do i want to predefine the rolling sum window right so i'm going to define"
5625840,5633280," the following variable i64 sum and initially it's going to be zero uh right might as well just put it"
5633280,5639600," somewhere here okay so once i discovered how to move lines around it actually became way more simpler to"
5639600,5647600," work with like holy right because quite often when i work uh when i edit in vim or emacs uh i think in"
5647600,5652640," terms of moving lines around rather than characters and i really really miss that feature so now"
5652640,5657600," what i do is essentially i just select a particular section i just ctrl x and ctrl v"
5657600,5661840," so like in the classical editor it almost works like a classical editor which is really convenient"
5661840,5668320," uh all right so what i want to do i want to perform like three iterations uh right i want to"
5668320,5679040," perform three iterations but the question is how can i easily do that i need to allocate another variable"
5679040,5690160," something like i64 i zero and for i equal zero less than three plus plus i i essentially need to repeat"
5690960,5701760," this thing and add the result to the um to the sum right so that's what i need to do in here uh so here"
5701760,5709600," is the x and uh i'm just going to be adding this thing to the sum there we go okay that's cool"
5709600,5714960," that is very very cool"
5718000,5724320," so we don't really need i after that but that's fine so here we continue we read the next x and now"
5724320,5729760," i need to essentially um come up with the"
5729760,5736480," with the next sum right so i need a variable for the next sum"
5739200,5748480," so i64 next sum right so this is the next sum uh and next sum"
5748480,5758880," is essentially the current sum minus the previous value basically by previous value i'm gonna uh i'm"
5758880,5765760," gonna call the element at the beginning of the window right so the beginning of the window and i'm gonna add"
5765760,5775520," x so that acts like the next uh you know the next sum in here and that acts like the next sum and in here"
5775520,5784560," now uh if uh fabulous floor yes it is thank you so much for two months of twitch prime solution thank"
5784560,5790960," you thank you thank you and welcome to epic divine club uh all right so what we're gonna do so this is"
5790960,5800320," is gonna be if the next sum if the next sum is greater oh this is not particularly convenient right"
5800320,5805520," so maybe i have to actually keep track of all the three elements all right"
5805520,5818000," um didn't consider that so maybe yeah i was hoping that i can just yeah i need to keep track of all of the"
5818000,5823920," three elements unfortunately all right let's go ahead and do that i mean it's just not that difficult to"
5823920,5832640," do uh right so we can have something like a b c and d for the next like fourth element if you know what"
5832640,5838880," i'm talking about right so and in here uh i'm gonna just have i'm gonna repeat the same code three times"
5839680,5847280," uh right uh right i'm gonna repeat the same code three times so first for the uh a right we don't"
5847280,5853680," really need this thing anymore right uh so i wonder if i can just like do something like this"
5853680,5862960," cool so this is gonna be first for the a then we're gonna have b uh then"
5863680,5873760," oh what the has happened okay then c and we don't not gonna do any d right we're not gonna do any d"
5873760,5879760," so and in here uh when i search for the next one i'm gonna just assign it to d"
5879760,5888880," and the current sum is going to be a b c and the next one is going to be b c d right so uh and essentially"
5888880,5897920," uh i can actually quite easily check all of them uh so if the next sum b plus c plus d right uh b"
5897920,5906240," plus c plus d is greater than a plus uh b plus c i increase the answer right and then i basically uh"
5906240,5916400," you know reassign everything uh accordingly so a becomes b b uh becomes c and c becomes d"
5916400,5923440," right so this is the simplest code i can come up with actually so and then we don't really need x"
5923440,5929760," anymore uh right so here is the size of the whole thing uh then the the parsing state then the answer"
5929760,5933920," we don't even need previous right we don't keep track of the previous we don't need these things"
5933920,5939760," the only things we need is a b c d right so and that's basically the rolling window in here"
5941440,5942480," um"
5942480,5950960," and then we increment the answer and this one is going to be just basically part two"
5950960,5956960," and i wonder if it's going to work i'm actually a little bit concerned whether it's going to work"
5956960,5965440," maybe i want to test that on the um on the sample data right let's actually try to compile this entire"
5965440,5971920," thing and it kind of worked it printed 16 18 but i'm not sure if that's the correct answer"
5971920,5977600," i'm really not sure if that's the correct answer i would rather test that on the sample data uh so"
5977600,5984160," let's actually take the sample data and in this case we have like five uh right so uh let's go ahead and"
5984160,5990240," just quit the operating system right uh super quick and uh i'm gonna mount this entire stuff right"
5990240,6000000," i'm gonna mount it and i'm gonna go inside gotcha hyper so this is home uh here's the input and i'm"
6000000,6009840," gonna do ed i probably want to do a pseudo right so ed sample txt uh right so and what i'm gonna put in there"
6011200,6018400," oh boy i probably have to prepare this data first so let me copy paste that to uh to my trusty emacs"
6018400,6026880," uh there we go i'm gonna remove that and here we have a new line right so i'm copy pasting"
6026880,6039600," fuck uh one more time one more time and then i press this and then i save this entire thing and then"
6039600,6047520," quit this entire thing so and in sample txt i have everything in here and i hope i do have the last"
6047520,6052800," new line in here okay so i do have last new line it's kind of important to have this uh have this uh"
6052800,6063280," last new line for the parsing right okay so uh let me now unmount uh you mount uh you mount mnt"
6064080,6070640," uh uh sudo uh there we go so everything seems to be okay ls mnt and i'm gonna run the uh data operating"
6070640,6082320," system okay okay uh so uh let me see do we have the sample thingy so here is the sample and if i take a"
6082320,6088160," look inside of it here is the data right that's the data from the website so it's really actually kind of"
6088160,6092640," cool that i can exchange the data between the host operating system and the guest one i really like"
6092640,6101360," that uh okay so let's go into aoc 2021 and day one uh okay so i'm going to extend the window"
6101360,6110400," uh all right so sample sample i'm going to press f5 so there is a five of them and"
6112080,6118960," according to the official data it's a five sums okay on the sample data in fact it works everything"
6118960,6124240," works on the sample data the question is where does it really work correctly on the actual input data"
6124240,6131040," right on the actual input data it's 1618 so let's try to submit that right i have no reason to not"
6131040,6134640," believe that this could be the case let's put 1618"
6136800,6146400," we solve the first day in temple s from scratch let's go all right so yeah we did uh so"
6146400,6152480," i really need to spend some time actually learning the operating system and learning the editor"
6152480,6159520," because that was difficult that was painful right so i also need to learn how to search for different"
6159520,6164000," examples and stuff like that i'm going to spend some time uh off screen like going through these"
6164000,6169440," tutorials and stuff like that because it's probably not that interesting to watch right and then maybe"
6169440,6176880," the next day the next day we uh the entire process is going to be more uh like more efficient and"
6176880,6184320," whatnot so i also want to publish all of these scripts uh you know um to the git lab or something"
6184320,6189120," but i need to think how i want to organize them right so i want a script that installs everything and"
6189120,6193840," prepares everything we have script that runs everything and also scripts that mounts everything"
6193840,6198560," so uh yeah i'm gonna put the link to the source code in the description but the source code is not"
6198560,6204720," prepared yet right source code uh and i'm gonna put tbd in here just to remind myself that i need to do"
6204720,6212480," that uh all right so that was pretty big not gonna lie and we already spent like almost two hours doing"
6212480,6218640," that so we're pretty on time right so because i usually to uh do two hours stream all right i guess"
6218640,6223280," that's it for today that was actually very cool thanks everyone who's watching me right now i really"
6223280,6228400," appreciate that thank you for all of the subscriptions and donations and stuff like that i especially"
6228400,6235280," appreciate that and i see you all the next time i'm not sure if i'm gonna stream every uh every"
6235280,6240640," day so maybe some of the days i'm gonna do uh off screen because sometimes i need a time off from"
6240640,6245520," streaming because it's actually kind of intensive so maybe the next day maybe tomorrow i'm not gonna"
6245520,6250960," stream and tomorrow's day is gonna be basically offline i'm gonna just record myself doing that and then"
6250960,6257680," publish it on youtube uh right so if you're watching it live um here's the uh youtube channel where i"
6257680,6262960," publish uh all of my recordings so sometimes i do offline sessions where i don't stream i just record"
6262960,6268960," like offline so maybe the second day is gonna be that uh all right so thanks everyone for watching and"
6268960,6274800," let's maybe rate somebody is anyone doing advent of code right now on the science it's not a science and"
6274800,6281520," technology it's a software development section of twitch uh alrighty thanks everyone that was actually"
6281520,6290960," super fun i really enjoyed that holy shit mine got okay kraut so let's wait uh maybe i should stop the"
6290960,6298400," temple as maybe it actually hogs the entire machine so provod uh provod is streaming so is he streaming like"
6298400,6305440," some software development i'm okay he's doing like a vulcan ray tracing okay so provod is actually very"
6305440,6311840," cool uh computer graphics developer computer graphics hacker and what he's currently doing he is actually"
6311840,6321360," adding ray tracing support for an open source half-life one engine using vulcan okay so that's how cool he is"
6322080,6328640," so we're gonna rate him uh so i'm gonna do rate provod he usually streams in russian but he also speaks"
6328640,6335360," english so uh if he speaks in that weird click on language just ask him to please speak english and he"
6335360,6342320," will answer you in english uh all right so um let's uh let's start the rate get ready for the rate boys and"
6342320,6354960," girls get ready for the rate and i see you all and next time love you"
