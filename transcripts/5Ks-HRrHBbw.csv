779880,809860," I don't know."
809860,839840," The next state is, the next state is generated on the next state is generated on the previous state."
839840,869820," Let me see."
869840,899820," But yeah, so this is what we do."
899820,929800," of control."
929800,959780," So, I don't think it's a good idea."

7885160,7885160,", so, okay."
7885160,7892160," Nice criteria for old software, right? So it's available on Debian that means it's pretty old."
7892160,7909160," Okay, so can we run it? Okay, nice. So..."
7913160,7919160," It works for good software, by the way."
7919160,7926360," Wow, wait a second. This is such a good software. I just run it and it did exactly what I expected."
7926360,7931320," Even though I heard it can simulate all sorts of cellular automata with different rules."
7931320,7941160," You can specify your own rules and shit like that. But I just opened it and it by default did a game of life."
7941160,7950160," And it worked exactly as I would expect. This is so rare when a software shows right of the bat reasonable defaults."
7950160,7955160," Well, what is going on? Encoding? It's probably because of the grid. I'm sorry."
7955160,7958160," So, can you open pattern?"
7958160,7965160," Okay, so yeah. So it can open leaf files. This is actually pretty cool."
7968160,7972160," This is actually pretty cool. So we can open the leaf files."
7972160,7974160," So let me go here."
7974160,7976160," And I'm going to go to the programming."
7976160,7977160," And this is studying."
7977160,7980160," And we need to open a automata."
7980160,7982160," Where is the automata?"
7982160,7983160," Here is the automata."
7983160,7985160," And we can open some of these things."
7985160,7987160," So which one should we open?"
7987160,7989160," I want to take a look at the rakes."
7989160,7992160," Do you want to save? No."
7992160,7994160," Okay, so here's a bunch of things."
7994160,7996160," Can we..."
7996160,7999160," So, is that a single?"
7999160,8000160," Oh, that's..."
8000160,8001160," Holy shit, this is so cool."
8001160,8003160," And it's so fast, by the way."
8003160,8006160," Can you see that?"
8006160,8009160," Holy shit, this is so cool."
8010160,8011160," And it's..."
8011160,8012160," Yeah, how is it so fast?"
8012160,8014160," I can actually move around."
8014160,8016160," Yeah."
8016160,8019160," So yeah, this is the seeds."
8019160,8021160," And it's a rake."
8021160,8023160," It just throws them around."
8023160,8027160," This is so cool."
8027160,8029160," And the software is so intuitive."
8029160,8032160," If you know how to work with several automata."
8032160,8033160," Seriously."
8033160,8036160," Here's how to get what I'm doing."
8036160,8037160," So you need a goalie."
8037160,8039160," Alright."
8040160,8041160," I guess it's cross-platform."
8041160,8043160," I don't know if it works on Windows."
8043160,8046160," It must be working on Windows."
8046160,8050160," Yeah, maybe there is a distribution for Windows."
8050160,8057160," Is it moving?"
8057160,8059160," I think they're all coming down."
8059160,8061160," So I'm standing still."
8061160,8065160," Yeah, so this is the..."
8065160,8067160," The screen is the point of reference."
8067160,8068160," The screen is the point of reference."
8068160,8071160," So they're both moving up and down."
8071160,8073160," So the main spaceship moves up."
8073160,8075160," And the trail moves down."
8075160,8078160," So you need goalie."
8078160,8080160," And in the page seeds."
8080160,8082160," In the page seeds."
8082160,8084160," Right."
8084160,8086160," You go down and you get the collection of seed patterns."
8086160,8089160," So we can try to open something."
8089160,8091160," Something else."
8091160,8092160," So rake path."
8092160,8093160," Alright."
8093160,8094160," So let's take a look at this rake path."
8094160,8095160," So let's take a look at this rake path."
8107160,8108160," That's so cool."
8108160,8108160," That's so cool."
8108160,8119160," But we're looking not into the build patterns."
8119160,8124160," We're looking into the ones provided for the seeds game."
8124160,8126160," For the seeds game."
8126160,8128160," That's pretty dang."
8128160,8130160," Goalie is pretty cool."
8130160,8131160," How do you come up with the sponsorships?"
8131160,8131160," I don't know."
8131160,8132160," So I guess you need to ask Brian Silverman."
8132160,8133160," Who actually did that."
8133160,8134160," Apparently there is this guy."
8134160,8135160," Who is a huge enthusiast in cellular automata."
8135160,8137160," And he came up with all sorts of different interesting rules."
8137160,8139160," And different patterns in those rules."
8139160,8140160," And apparently he contributed a lot into the cellular automata thing."
8140160,8141160," He's a Canadian computer scientist."
8141160,8142160," And creator of many programming environments for children."
8142160,8143160," And researcher in cellular automata."
8143160,8144160," Yeah."
8144160,8145160," Interesting."
8145160,8146160," Hmm."
8146160,8146160," Cool."
8146160,8147160," Hmm."
8147160,8147160," Cool."
8147160,8148160," Because everything is in cellular automata."
8148160,8148160," And he's a computer scientist."
8148160,8149160," And he's a computer scientist."
8149160,8150160," And he's a computer scientist."
8150160,8151160," He's a computer scientist."
8151160,8152160," And creator of many programming environments for children."
8152160,8153160," And researcher in cellular automata."
8153160,8154160," Yeah."
8154160,8155160," Interesting."
8155160,8156160," Hmm."
8156160,8157160," Cool."
8157160,8158160," Because everything is in cellular automata."
8158160,8159160," And he's in cellular automata."
8159160,8160160," And he's in cellular automata."
8160160,8161160," And he's in cellular automata."
8161160,8162160," And he's in cellular automata."
8162160,8163160," And he's in cellular automata."
8163160,8164160," And he's in cellular automata."
8164160,8165160," And he's in cellular automata."
8165160,8166160," And he's in cellular automata."
8166160,8167160," And he's in cellular automata."
8167160,8168160," And he's in cellular automata."
8168160,8169160," And he's in cellular automata."
8169160,8170160," And he's in cellular automata."
8170160,8171160," Hmm."
8171160,8176160," Cool."
8176160,8179160," Because every time I Google something about cellular automata."
8179160,8180160," Like, his name pops up."
8180160,8184160," So, he's like a really huge enthusiast in cellular automata."
8184160,8185160," All right."
8185160,8187160," So, this was Sid."
8187160,8192160," And another pattern that he came up with is Brian's brain."
8192160,8195160," Which is slightly different."
8195160,8198160," So, the special thing about this pattern is that."
8198160,8201160," This cell can be in three states."
8201160,8203160," Unlike in Game of Life or Seeds."
8203160,8206160," Where you can have only alive or dead cell."
8206160,8210160," Here you have alive, dying and dead."
8210160,8215160," So, you have like a gradient of, you know, of this state."
8215160,8217160," Not really gradient."
8217160,8219160," But you have more states, essentially."
8219160,8220160," That's what I'm trying to say."
8220160,8222160," I wonder if there is like..."
8222160,8225160," I know that there are continuous cellular automata."
8225160,8226160," Right?"
8226160,8228160," So, that are not on the grid."
8228160,8231160," But rather, the cells are floating point."
8231160,8233160," Floating point coordinates."
8233160,8235160," Have floating point coordinates."
8235160,8236160," And you..."
8236160,8241160," Because of that, you get very smooth, roundy gliders."
8241160,8242160," That move around."
8242160,8244160," And they look like literal cells."
8244160,8245160," I don't know if I actually show that."
8245160,8247160," So, let me show you."
8247160,8251160," I wonder if they also have continuous state."
8251160,8252160," So..."
8252160,8255160," I know that they have continuous position."
8255160,8257160," But do they have continuous state?"
8257160,8258160," That's a good question."
8258160,8259160," So..."
8259160,8262160," Continuous game of life."
8262160,8265160," I'm not sure if I will be able to find something."
8265160,8266160," Oh, yeah."
8266160,8267160," Smooth life."
8267160,8268160," This one."
8268160,8269160," So, it looks like this."
8269160,8271160," So, this is essentially like cellular automata."
8271160,8272160," Automaton, rather."
8272160,8286160," But it's continuous instead of discrete one."
8286160,8291160," So, I suppose they have continuous position and continuous state."
8291160,8292160," And these gliders, like..."
8292160,8294160," They do look like cells."
8294160,8295160," Uh..."
8295160,8304160," Yeah, it looks pretty trippy."
8304160,8308160," Uh..."
8308160,8310160," So, maybe we can implement that at some point as well."
8310160,8311160," I don't know."
8311160,8312160," Uh..."
8312160,8313160," We'll see."
8313160,8314160," We'll see."
8314160,8315160," But that's..."
8315160,8316160," That's pretty cool."
8316160,8317160," Uh..."
8317160,8318160," Alrighty."
8318160,8319160," Uh..."
8319160,8320160," So..."
8320160,8321160," I'm gonna remove it for now."
8321160,8322160," Um..."
8322160,8326160," So, you know what?"
8326160,8327160," Um..."
8327160,8330160," When we run game of life, right?"
8330160,8332160," When we run game of life."
8332160,8333160," Uh..."
8333160,8336160," We have a bunch of gliders in here."
8336160,8338160," So, maybe for the seeds."
8338160,8341160," We also need to create a bunch of gliders that move around."
8341160,8342160," Uh..."
8342160,8343160," When you by default enable it."
8343160,8344160," I think..."
8344160,8346160," I think it's a good idea generally."
8346160,8347160," Um..."
8347160,8348160," Yeah."
8348160,8349160," By the way."
8349160,8350160," If I re..."
8350160,8351160," Uh..."
8351160,8352160," Rebuild everything."
8352160,8353160," If I rebuild everything."
8353160,8354160," Without changing anything."
8354160,8356160," And rerun game of life."
8356160,8359160," Game of life automatically has this pose symbol."
8359160,8361160," Because it's part of the framework."
8361160,8362160," Yeah."
8362160,8365160," Alright."
8365160,8368160," Uh..."
8368160,8370160," Let me remove that."
8370160,8371160," Um..."
8371160,8372160," Okay."
8372160,8373160," Um..."
8373160,8373160," Uh..."
8373160,8374160," Uh..."
8374160,8375160," Uh..."
8375160,8376160," Seeds."
8376160,8377160," Um..."
8377160,8378160," Uh..."
8378160,8379160," Uh..."
8379160,8380160," Uh..."
8380160,8381160," Um..."
8381160,8382160," Uh..."
8382160,8383160," Uh..."
8383160,8384160," Bolt membrane."
8384160,8385160," No."
8385160,8386160," I never heard of it."
8386160,8387160," Uh..."
8387160,8388160," So..."
8388160,8389160," Add."
8389160,8390160," Put."
8390160,8391160," Glider."
8391160,8392160," Add."
8392160,8393160," Uh..."
8393160,8394160," It's going to do board."
8394160,8395160," Uh..."
8395160,8397160," And provide the role and column."
8397160,8400160," Role and column."
8400160,8401160," So..."
8401160,8402160," Uh..."
8402160,8403160," So what kind of..."
8403160,8405160," What kind of..."
8405160,8405160," Uh..."
8405160,8406160," Glider I want to have there."
8406160,8407160," What kind of grinder I want to have."
8407160,8408160," Uh..."
8408160,8409160," Uh..."
8409160,8412160," So..."
8412160,8414160," The simplest one looks like this."
8414160,8415160," Right."
8415160,8417160," The simplest one looks like this."
8417160,8420160," And what's interesting about this specific glider."
8420160,8421160," It works."
8421160,8423160," At any direction."
8423160,8426160," You can point it at any direction."
8426160,8428160," And it will move in that direction."
8428160,8429160," So that's cool."
8429160,8430160," That's what's cool about it."
8430160,8432160," And..."
8432160,8433160," Oh!"
8433160,8434160," And the simple oscillator."
8434160,8437160," So this simple oscillator looks like this."
8437160,8438160," Huh."
8439160,8440160," That's so cool."
8440160,8442160," And then we can actually put some stuff in here."
8442160,8443160," And..."
8443160,8445160," And that will explode in chaos."
8445160,8449160," That's so funny."
8449160,8451160," Look at that."
8451160,8452160," You have like a simple glider."
8452160,8453160," Right."
8453160,8455160," Uh..."
8455160,8456160," Just an oscillator."
8460160,8461160," Oh..."
8461160,8461160," Holy shit."
8461160,8462160," This..."
8462160,8463160," Uh..."
8463160,8464160," Uh..."
8464160,8465160," Uh..."
8465160,8466160," Uh..."
8466160,8467160," Uh..."
8467160,8467160," Uh..."
8467160,8468160," Uh..."
8468160,8468160," Uh..."
8468160,8469160," Uh..."
8469160,8469160," Uh..."
8469160,8470160," Uh..."
8470160,8471160," Uh..."
8471160,8471160," Uh..."
8471160,8472160," Uh..."
8472160,8473160," Uh..."
8473160,8473160," Uh..."
8473160,8474160," Uh..."
8474160,8475160," Uh..."
8475160,8475160," Uh..."
8475160,8475160," Uh..."
8475160,8476160," Uh..."
8476160,8477160," Uh..."
8477160,8477160," Uh..."
8477160,8477160," Uh..."
8477160,8478160," Uh..."
8478160,8479160," Uh..."
8479160,8480160," Uh..."
8480160,8481160," Uh..."
8481160,8481160," Uh..."
8481160,8482160," To be fair, we wanna actually..."
8482160,8483160," Uh..."
8483160,8484160," Uh..."
8484160,8485160," Uh..."
8485160,8486160," Uh..."
8486160,8487160," Uh..."
8487160,8488160," Uh..."
8488160,8489160," Uh..."
8489160,8491160," It's probably not even called the glider, but..."
8491160,8492160," Yeah."
8492160,8493160," Uh..."
8493160,8494160," So, to put..."
8494160,8497160," It in a particular direction, that means we'll have to rotate and stuff."
8497160,8498160," But, uh..."
8498160,8499160," I don't wanna do that."
8499160,8500160," So, uh..."
8500160,8501160," Uh..."
8501160,8502160," Let me have a cell."
8502160,8503160," And we're gonna have a glider."
8503160,8505160," And the glider is gonna be..."
8505160,8506160," Right."
8506160,8508160," So, it's gonna be something like..."
8508160,8509160," This."
8509160,8510160," Right."
8510160,8511160," It's gonna be this."
8511160,8512160," Uh..."
8512160,8513160," This."
8513160,8514160," And, uh..."
8514160,8515160," This."
8515160,8518160," Means its size is four by two."
8518160,8519160," Right."
8519160,8520160," You have four rows."
8520160,8521160," And, uh..."
8521160,8522160," Two columns."
8522160,8523160," Right."
8523160,8525160," Four rows and two columns."
8525160,8529160," And let me quickly populate that."
8529160,8530160," So, it's gonna be..."
8530160,8531160," Uh..."
8531160,8532160," On..."
8532160,8533160," And off."
8533160,8534160," On and off."
8534160,8537160," One, two, three, four."
8537160,8538160," And..."
8538160,8539160," Boom."
8539160,8540160," Boom."
8540160,8541160," There we go."
8541160,8542160," I just did..."
8542160,8544160," I just encoded this pattern."
8544160,8545160," Uh..."
8545160,8547160," It was kinda easy."
8547160,8548160," Uh..."
8548160,8550160," We can also put it in a static memory."
8550160,8555160," Um..."
8555160,8558160," So, now I'm gonna be iterating through all of this stuff."
8558160,8559160," Uh..."
8559160,8560160," D row."
8560160,8561160," Zero."
8561160,8562160," Zero."
8562160,8563160," Zero."
8563160,8564160," Um..."
8564160,8565160," Less than four."
8565160,8566160," Then four."
8566160,8567160," Int."
8567160,8568160," D column."
8568160,8569160," D column."
8569160,8570160," And then D column."
8570160,8571160," Less than two."
8571160,8572160," Plus plus D column."
8572160,8573160," Uh..."
8573160,8574160," All right."
8574160,8574160," And..."
8574160,8575160," Initial values in here."
8575160,8576160," I think it should be called row zero and column zero."
8576160,8577160," Right."
8577160,8578160," Because they're just offsets."
8578160,8579160," And..."
8579160,8580160," We're gonna have row."
8580160,8581160," Uh..."
8581160,8582160," Which is an integer."
8582160,8583160," Uh..."
8583160,8584160," Row zero."
8584160,8585160," Row zero."
8585160,8586160," Plus D row."
8586160,8587160," And we're gonna wrap it around."
8587160,8588160," Uh..."
8588160,8589160," Horizontally."
8589160,8590160," And this entire thing should be wrapped around."
8590160,8591160," Uh..."
8591160,8592160," Vertically."
8592160,8593160," There we go."
8593160,8594160," And then we take the board."
8594160,8595160," Cells."
8595160,8596160," Row and column."
8596160,8597160," And..."
8597160,8598160," Uh..."
8598160,8599160," We set it to glider."
8599160,8600160," Um..."
8600160,8601160," Uh..."
8601160,8602160," D row."
8602160,8603160," D column."
8603160,8604160," Like this."
8604160,8606160," So essentially we're just copying this pattern."
8606160,8608160," Like we're slapping the pattern onto the board."
8608160,8609160," And..."
8609160,8610160," Uh..."
8610160,8611160," We're just copying this pattern."
8611160,8613160," Like we're slapping the pattern onto the board."
8613160,8614160," Uh..."
8614160,8615160," Uh..."
8615160,8616160," D row."
8616160,8617160," D column."
8617160,8618160," Like this."
8618160,8620160," So essentially we're just copying this pattern."
8620160,8622160," Like we're slapping the pattern onto the board."
8622160,8623160," Right."
8623160,8624160," Okay."
8624160,8627160," So now I can actually slap a bunch of them."
8627160,8628160," Uh..."
8628160,8630160," So how many of them I wanna put there?"
8630160,8631160," Uh..."
8631160,8632160," I wanna put..."
8632160,8633160," Oh my god."
8633160,8634160," Let's say five."
8634160,8637160," No plus plus I."
8637160,8638160," Uh..."
8638160,8639160," Put glider at."
8639160,8641160," I provide the board FG."
8641160,8642160," And..."
8642160,8643160," So..."
8643160,8644160," In terms of why."
8644160,8647160," I'm gonna keep it on the same level I suppose."
8647160,8648160," Might as well actually..."
8648160,8649160," Yeah."
8649160,8651160," I might as well actually do something like this."
8651160,8652160," Um..."
8652160,8656160," Multiply by..."
8656160,8657160," Two."
8657160,8658160," Maybe..."
8658160,8659160," Maybe three."
8659160,8660160," Yeah."
8660160,8661160," Multiply by three."
8661160,8662160," I think it's gonna create a pretty interesting pattern."
8662160,8663160," Uh..."
8663160,8664160," And..."
8664160,8665160," I forgot to..."
8665160,8666160," I forgot to rebuild."
8666160,8667160," Is it gonna work now?"
8667160,8668160," And..."
8668160,8669160," It kinda did."
8669160,8670160," But I think it was..."
8670160,8671160," Uh..."
8671160,8672160," Uh..."
8672160,8672160," I think I need..."
8672160,8673160," Uh..."
8673160,8674160," Four instead of three."
8674160,8675160," I think I need..."
8675160,8676160," Four instead of three."
8676160,8677160," I think I need four instead of three."
8677160,8678160," Uh..."
8678160,8679160," And there we go."
8679160,8680160," So..."
8680160,8681160," That's pretty cool."
8681160,8682160," Um..."
8682160,8682160," I also wanna be able to rotate them and what not."
8682160,8683160," Uh..."
8683160,8684160," Uh..."
8684160,8685160," Uh..."
8685160,8686160," Uh..."
8686160,8687160," Uh..."
8687160,8688160," Uh..."
8688160,8689160," Uh..."
8689160,8689160," Uh..."
8689160,8690160," Uh..."
8690160,8691160," Uh..."
8691160,8705160," I also want to be able to rotate them and whatnot. So let's say that I want to have like 10 of them."
8705160,8725160," But to rotate them, right, to rotate them, I basically have to transpose them and whatnot."
8725160,8728160," But yeah, maybe for now I'm just going to keep it like this."
8728160,8734160," So random row, random board, let's not put a random board in here."
8734160,8741160," All right, let's commit whatever we have."
8741160,8753160," Put a bunch of gliders into initial seeds state."
8753160,8758160," Okay, that's pretty cool. And again, I'm going to declare the seeds done."
8758160,8763160," We explored the seeds a little bit. We implemented it and it looks pretty cool."
8763160,8768160," All right, I'm going to push that right into the repo."
8768160,8772160," Again, you can find all the source code in here, so I'm pushing it live."
8772160,8779160," So it should be available for everyone. Now, what we can do?"
8779160,8785160," What we can do? We should implement Brian's brain. But I want to do that after I make a cup of tea."
8785160,8787160," Does anyone have any questions while I'm making a cup of tea?"
8787160,8793160," Do one like DVD logo that never hits the corner. I don't know how to do that."
8793160,8805160," Yeah, so the problem with these streams, with cellar automata streams is because it really hurts the encoding, right?"
8805160,8808160," Because it's a lot of moving things. It probably hurts the encoding right now."
8808160,8822160," So the tea that I'm drinking right now is Earl Grey. It's definitely Earl Grey."
8822160,8827160," Does anyone have any questions? Maybe? Or everyone is just busy doing their own thing?"
8827160,8831160," Is this much harder to do in something like Haskell?"
8831160,8836160," Depends on your experience, I suppose."
8836160,8846160," I can wrap my head around how you do that."
8846160,8857160," Actually, translating imperative code in Haskell is a relatively easy thing to do."
8857160,8865160," Essentially, in any imperative program, you have an implicit state that you modify all the time."
8865160,8875160," So, let me see. So, you have a program."
8875160,8880160," Yeah, you have a particular state that is comprised of two variables."
8880160,8882160," And throughout your program, what you do?"
8882160,8890160," You modify that state by adding new things, then subtracting some things, and so on and so forth."
8890160,8897160," So, you basically, here is your state, and here are modifications of those states, right?"
8897160,8904160," So, essentially, to program something like that in a functional way, in a purely functional declarative way,"
8904160,8909160," instead of having state like that, you would have it as a value, right?"
8909160,8924160," So, you would define something like data state, which is state something like state x, which is an integer, and so on and so forth."
8924160,8930160," And then you're going to have a function like f1 that takes a state and returns you a new state."
8930160,8937160," And within that function, you take that state, you extract x out of that state, right?"
8937160,8944160," Then you add 10 to it, and then you save it back into the original state like this."
8944160,8945160," And there you go."
8945160,8949160," You just encode it as a function, this line of code."
8949160,8954160," Right, so this could be f1."
8954160,8960160," Then you can have f2, which does kind of a similar thing, right?"
8960160,8964160," Kind of a similar thing, but instead of modifying x, it modifies y, right?"
8964160,8970160," So, in that case, it subtracts 20 from y."
8970160,8971160," And there we go."
8971160,8972160," You have the original state."
8972160,8976160," So, your original state is going to be something like 20, 30, right?"
8976160,8984160," And that means your default state is going to be state 20, 30."
8984160,8989160," And then you take the default state, you apply f1, you apply f2,"
8989160,8998160," and essentially you encode it the same thing in a declarative, purely functional way as in C here."
8998160,9006160," This is like a very rough example, but that's pretty much what it means, right?"
9006160,9014160," You basically need to learn how to identify those states that are implicitly there in imperative programs,"
9014160,9018160," and you just have to write those states explicitly."
9018160,9020160," That's it."
9020160,9021160," Seriously."
9021160,9023160," It's just, that's it."
9023160,9029160," So, the actual difference between imperative code and functional code is that the state is just explicit."
9029160,9036160," And that's why I lost interest in Haskell recently, because..."
9036160,9038160," Yeah, I get it."
9038160,9041160," Is there something else here?"
9041160,9043160," So, yeah."
9043160,9046160," Instead of modifying state, you create a new one."
9046160,9048160," Yeah, I guess, essentially."
9048160,9060160," But in case of Haskell, it may not copy the whole state, because you also may have like a persistent data structure that actually don't have copies of the structures."
9060160,9067160," Essentially, the next state of the structure is the previous state plus modifications that you need to get the new state."
9067160,9072160," So, it's usually sometimes like can be stored more efficiently than just copying around."
9072160,9074160," So, yeah."
9074160,9076160," That's it."
9076160,9077160," That's it."
9077160,9078160," That's it."
9078160,9079160," That's it."
9079160,9086160," And what's interesting is that you can have different abstractions on top of that."
9086160,9091160," So, you can turn this into a state transformers, right?"
9091160,9096160," So, this particular function is essentially a state transformer, right?"
9096160,9100160," So, it takes one state and transforms it into another."
9100160,9107160," And what's interesting is that you can actually demonstrate that such function that takes one state and returns another one is a monad."
9107160,9120160," So, that means you can compose these state transformers in a very monadic way and can even have like a do notation that will make your Haskell code, which looks like this, look like that."
9120160,9123160," So, I tell that over and over again."
9123160,9125160," So, what you do in Haskell?"
9125160,9127160," What you do to program in Haskell?"
9127160,9132160," You first re-implement C and then you program in C."
9132160,9135160," And this is not a joke, seriously."
9135160,9140160," So, to do anything useful in Haskell, first you need to reinvent imperative language."
9140160,9147160," And only then, once you have imperative language reinvented in the functional one, you can do something useful in it."
9147160,9149160," So, yeah."
9149160,9152160," That's pretty much the gist of pure functional programming."
9152160,9153160," That's, yeah."
9153160,9154160," That's it."
9154160,9155160," Seriously."
9157160,9158160," Anyway."
9158160,9160160," So, what I wanted to do, I wanted to actually make a cup of tea."
9160160,9161160," Yeah, yeah."
9161160,9175160," I'm not saying that Haskell is bad or functional approach is bad."
9175160,9185160," I'm just saying that after you sort of cracked this sort of idea and you build in your head isomorphism between imperative programming and functional programming,"
9185160,9188160," it doesn't really sound as exciting anymore, right?"
9188160,9189160," Yeah."
9189160,9192160," It's just the same thing but from a different angle."
9192160,9193160," Yeah."
9193160,9198160," So, once you realize that, it's kind of like, yeah, it's just another way of programming the same thing."
9198160,9199160," All right."
9199160,9200160," So, let's make a small break."
9200160,9201160," So, it's going to be..."
9201160,9206160," I think I'm not going to make a small break because I'm going to quickly go to the kitchen, turn on the kettle and I'm going to be back."
9206160,9207160," So, let's make a small break."
9207160,9208160," So, let's make a small break."
9208160,9209160," So, let's make a small break."
9209160,9210160," So, let's make a small break."
9210160,9211160," So, let's make a small break."
9211160,9212160," So, let's make a small break."
9212160,9213160," So, let's make a small break."
9213160,9214160," So, let's make a small break."
9214160,9215160," So, let's make a small break."
9215160,9216160," So, let's make a small break."
9216160,9217160," So, let's make a small break."
9217160,9218160," So, let's make a small break."
9218160,9219160," So, let's make a small break."
9219160,9220160," So, let's make a small break."
9220160,9221160," So, let's make a small break."
9221160,9222160," So, let's make a small break."
9222160,9223160," So, let's make a small break."
9223160,9224160," So, let's make a small break."
9224160,9225160," So, let's make a small break."
9225160,9243160," Well, it's actually not the whole truth."
9243160,9250160," I didn't tell you the whole truth about Haskell and imperative programming and stuff like that."
9250160,9252160," There is more to that."
9252160,9258160," There are different techniques that exploit the laziness of Haskell."
9258160,9264160," And basically, one of the technique is to, instead of modify the state like that, right?"
9264160,9270160," So, basically, you have initial state, you have a bunch of functions that transform the state and you compose this function."
9270160,9282160," There's another approach to the same idea is to create an infinite data structure that consists of all of the possible states."
9282160,9283160," Right?"
9283160,9288160," In Haskell, you can have an infinite data structure that is computed as you iterate through that data structure."
9288160,9289160," Right?"
9289160,9294160," And essentially, you can generate something like an infinite list of states."
9294160,9296160," Each state depends on the previous one."
9296160,9300160," And once you iterate the state, you sort of modify the state and move along."
9300160,9301160," And move along."
9301160,9304160," It's kind of like a different, completely different approach to that."
9304160,9307160," And it's even more difficult to understand than this."
9307160,9311160," But to be fair, it's yet another angle."
9311160,9312160," It's just the third angle."
9312160,9313160," Right?"
9313160,9315160," So, the first angle is imperative programming."
9315160,9318160," The second angle is function composition."
9318160,9324160," And the third angle is basically infinite data structures consisting of the trail of the states."
9324160,9328160," But they still pretty much describe the same thing."
9328160,9331160," None of them are more superior than in other ones."
9331160,9334160," They are just different angles on the same thing."
9334160,9337160," It's like, you know, Turing machine and lambda calculus."
9337160,9339160," Both of them Turing complete."
9339160,9341160," Both of them computational models."
9341160,9344160," It's just different angles at computational models pretty much."
9344160,9345160," So..."
9367160,9394160," That chatter demonstrates that sodding is one of Twitch's more genuine streamers."
9394160,9395160," What are you talking about?"
9395160,9396160," I like that all the time."
9396160,9401160," Uh..."
9401160,9402160," So..."
9402160,9403160," Okay."
9403160,9406160," Uh..."
9406160,9408160," So, we need to implement the brine brain."
9408160,9409160," Right?"
9409160,9410160," Uh..."
9410160,9411160," Let's implement brine brain."
9411160,9416160," And once I implement brine brain, I'm pretty sure I will be able to extract a lot of duplicate code."
9416160,9417160," Uh..."
9417160,9419160," But I'm not 100% sure about that."
9419160,9420160," So..."
9420160,9422160," So, how should we code?"
9422160,9423160," Uh..."
9423160,9424160," Brian's brain."
9424160,9425160," Brian's brain."
9425160,9426160," Oh..."
9426160,9430160," Yeah, I..."
9430160,9431160," God damn it."
9431160,9432160," I keep misspelling it."
9432160,9436160," So, Brian as a name is I-A."
9436160,9438160," And A-I is brain."
9438160,9439160," Brian's..."
9439160,9440160," Oh my god."
9440160,9441160," This messes up..."
9441160,9443160," This name actually messes with my brain."
9443160,9445160," Since I'm not an English speaker, so..."
9445160,9446160," It's just..."
9446160,9449160," I never thought that it's just, you know, swapped two characters."
9449160,9450160," Uh..."
9450160,9452160," That's really strange."
9452160,9453160," Okay."
9453160,9454160," Uh..."
9454160,9455160," Uh..."
9455160,9456160," Brian's..."
9456160,9457160," Brain."
9457160,9458160," There we go."
9458160,9459160," Mmm..."
9459160,9460160," Ban English."
9460160,9461160," Eh..."
9461160,9462160," I don't know."
9462160,9481160," I could start speaking Russian, but to be fair, my knowledge of Russian grammar is even worse than knowledge of English grammar."
9481160,9482160," So..."
9482160,9485160," To be fair, Russian grammar is even more complicated."
9485160,9487160," So, I still don't know."
9487160,9489160," It also has shit ton of exceptions."
9489160,9490160," Um..."
9490160,9491160," And stuff like that, so..."
9491160,9492160," Uh..."
9492160,9493160," Brian's brain generator factory."
9493160,9494160," I see."
9494160,9495160," Add Brian's brain to something."
9495160,9496160," Mmm..."
9496160,9497160," Why?"
9497160,9498160," Why would I do something like that?"
9498160,9499160," I can speak Japanese."
9499160,9500160," Cool."
9500160,9501160," Is it your native language?"
9501160,9502160," Or..."
9502160,9503160," No."
9503160,9504160," I can speak Japanese?"
9504160,9505160," No."
9505160,9506160," I can speak Japanese."
9506160,9507160," Cool."
9507160,9508160," Is it your native language?"
9508160,9509160," Oh..."
9509160,9510160," Why?"
9510160,9513160," Why would I do something like that?"
9513160,9514160," I can speak Japanese."
9514160,9515160," Cool."
9515160,9517160," Is it your native language?"
9517160,9518160," Oh..."
9518160,9519160," No."
9519160,9520160," I can speak Japanese."
9520160,9521160," Or..."
9521160,9523160," Is it your second language?"
9523160,9524160," Uh..."
9524160,9525160," You should check out the powder toy."
9525160,9527160," I checked it out a long time ago."
9527160,9534160," Powder toy is actually a very old thing, isn't it?"
9534160,9535160," Right?"
9535160,9536160," I think..."
9536160,9538160," Yeah."
9538160,9547160," I think I checked it out when I was second year in university and I graduated from university eight years ago."
9549160,9550160," Okay."
9550160,9553160," So, in university I was five years, I graduated eight years."
9553160,9554160," So, I was second..."
9554160,9555160," So, three..."
9555160,9556160," Yeah."
9556160,9557160," I checked it out eleven years ago."
9557160,9558160," So..."
9558160,9559160," Does it count?"
9559160,9560160," So..."
9560160,9563160," Or..."
9563160,9564160," Did it change over eleven years?"
9564160,9565160," No."
9565160,9566160," It's my second language."
9566160,9567160," English is my native."
9567160,9568160," Uh..."
9568160,9569160," I can't somewhat relate like that."
9569160,9570160," Oh, yeah."
9570160,9573160," The reason why I'm asking is that there's a really strange thing."
9573160,9578160," Like, I don't see any Japanese people online for some reason."
9578160,9579160," Right?"
9579160,9582160," I stream almost every day and we have people from around the world."
9582160,9583160," Right?"
9583160,9586160," And I don't see any Japanese people for some reason."
9586160,9588160," And even outside of Twitch."
9588160,9589160," Yeah."
9589160,9590160," They keep to themselves."
9590160,9596160," I also don't see many Chinese people, especially the ones who live in China specifically."
9596160,9597160," And I know the reason."
9597160,9598160," Right?"
9598160,9599160," Uh..."
9599160,9600160," So, because they're like..."
9600160,9601160," Their internet is closed."
9601160,9602160," But we do..."
9602160,9606160," I do see occasionally Chinese people who are outside of China."
9606160,9611160," Like, for example, who migrated to Europe or to the US."
9611160,9612160," So..."
9612160,9619160," But as far as I know, there is no technical, like, limitations for Japanese people to chat in English online."
9619160,9622160," So, it must be some sort of a cultural thing."
9622160,9627160," It must be some sort of cultural thing that they just isolate themselves intentionally."
9627160,9632160," Without the government forcing them or whatever."
9632160,9633160," Uh..."
9633160,9634160," Do you have a master's degree?"
9634160,9636160," No, I don't have a master's degree."
9636160,9637160," Fortunately."
9637160,9639160," Or maybe fortunately, I don't know."
9639160,9642160," Uh..."
9642160,9644160," Are there some French people here?"
9644160,9647160," I don't know if there are any French people right now here."
9647160,9648160," But, uh..."
9648160,9649160," Yeah, definitely."
9649160,9652160," We definitely had French people in the audience."
9652160,9653160," They just don't like it."
9653160,9656160," It's actually mostly because they don't speak English."
9656160,9657160," But, I mean, what's..."
9657160,9660160," It's not really a good reason."
9660160,9661160," Right?"
9661160,9662160," Because..."
9662160,9666160," They don't speak English because they didn't learn English."
9666160,9668160," So, and the question is why they didn't learn English."
9668160,9670160," Because they didn't feel the need to do so."
9670160,9671160," Right?"
9671160,9676160," For example, recently we had a lot of, like, more and more Russian people online."
9676160,9682160," And the majority of Russian people who you can see online in speaking English are the new generation."
9682160,9683160," Uh..."
9683160,9687160," That is completely separate from the previous generation who lived in Soviet Union."
9687160,9690160," People who lived in Soviet Union, who were raised in Soviet Union."
9690160,9694160," They are actually culturally closed and they don't want to learn anything new."
9694160,9697160," And they don't want to communicate with the outside of the world."
9697160,9698160," Right?"
9698160,9702160," But the new generation of Russians, they are really open to communicate with the rest of the world."
9702160,9704160," And they usually speak English."
9704160,9708160," And the majority of them speak English even better than me, which is kind of interesting."
9708160,9713160," ""There are Japanese streams on Twitch, but only in Japanese, never English."""
9713160,9714160," Oh, okay."
9714160,9718160," So that actually confirms my theory that they're just culturally closed."
9718160,9721160," ""Never try a self-hosted streaming site?"""
9721160,9723160," No, I never try that."
9723160,9724160," Um..."
9724160,9727160," I speak English because we feel separate."
9727160,9729160," Um..."
9729160,9731160," All right."
9731160,9732160," Um..."
9732160,9743160," Cheers, by the way."
9743160,9745160," They don't language in school."
9745160,9746160," Uh..."
9746160,9749160," Yeah, but the problem is that they never actually get proficient in it."
9749160,9755160," Culturally, they're not comfortable doing things they're not good at, which puts them in a negative feedback loop."
9755160,9757160," Oh, that's actually very interesting."
9757160,9758160," Huh."
9758160,9761160," All right, that makes sense."
9761160,9764160," Um..."
9764160,9765160," All right."
9765160,9769160," So let's read about Brian's brain."
9769160,9776160," There's a cellular automaton devised by Brian Sullivan, which is very similar to his SIDS rule that we implemented just recently."
9776160,9786160," ""Brian's brain consists of infinite two-dimensional grid of cells, but unlike SIDS, each cell may be in one of three states:"
9786160,9788160," on, dying or off."
9788160,9791160," Each cell is considered to have eight neighbors."
9791160,9792160," Uh..."
9792160,9793160," The Moore neighborhood..."""
9793160,9794160," Oh."
9794160,9796160," It even has a name for that."
9796160,9797160," Oh."
9797160,9798160," Okay."
9798160,9800160," I didn't know that this has a name."
9800160,9801160," Uh..."
9801160,9802160," What is it?"
9802160,9803160," Automaton."
9803160,9804160," Uh..."
9804160,9805160," You can google that."
9805160,9806160," Uh..."
9806160,9807160," Automaton."
9807160,9808160," Automaton."
9808160,9809160," Let me google that for you."
9809160,9816160," ""A moving mechanical device made in imitation of a human being."""
9816160,9822160," But that's not a really good definition because we are talking about a cellular, uh, cellular automaton."
9822160,9823160," Yeah."
9823160,9824160," So..."
9824160,9825160," Like, why?"
9825160,9826160," Google."
9826160,9827160," Why?"
9827160,9828160," Just why?"
9828160,9829160," Why?"
9829160,9830160," Why?"
9830160,9831160," Just why?"
9831160,9833160," Why do you do that?"
9833160,9834160," Who?"
9834160,9835160," Who at Google came up with that horrible, horrible idea of screwing up with my URLs?"
9835160,9836160," Who came up with it?"
9836160,9837160," I want to see that person."
9837160,9840160," And I want to personally tell them, looking in their eyes, you're fired."
9840160,9848160," I know that it doesn't change anything and you're probably not going to be fired, but I want to just tell them right in their eyes."
9848160,9849160," I'm sorry."
9849160,9850160," I'm sorry."
9850160,9851160," This just makes me mad."
9851160,9852160," Like, why?"
9852160,9853160," Just why?"
9853160,9854160," Who did this?"
9854160,9855160," Moth?"
9855160,9856160," Moth?"
9856160,9857160," Moth?"
9857160,9858160," Bam!"
9858160,9859160," Perman."
9859160,9860160," Okay, so..."
9860160,9861160," This is this."
9861160,9861160," This is this."
9861160,9862160," This is the thing."
9862160,9863160," Amp."
9863160,9864160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9864160,9865160," I really don't like this idea."
9865160,9866160," Okay."
9866160,9867160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9867160,9869160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9869160,9870160," But..."
9870160,9871160," I really don't like this idea."
9871160,9872160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9872160,9873160," But..."
9873160,9874160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9874160,9876160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9876160,9877160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9877160,9878160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9878160,9879160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9879160,9880160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9880160,9881160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9881160,9882160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9882160,9883160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9883160,9884160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9884160,9885160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9885160,9886160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9886160,9887160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9887160,9888160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9888160,9889160," I really don't like this idea."
9889160,9890160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9890160,9891160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9891160,9892160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9892160,9893160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9893160,9894160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9894160,9895160," I don't even know what is Amp to be fair."
9910160,9912160," Okay, that implies eight neighbors."
9912160,9920160," Okay, that's pretty cool."
9920160,9933160," Okay, so as in seats and in each time time step a cell turns on if it has if it was over but had exactly two neighbors that were on just like the birth rule for seats."
9933160,9939160," All seats that were on go into dying state which is not counted as on."
9939160,9944160," cell in the eight neighborhood and prevent any cell from being born there."
9944160,9946160," Cells that were on the dying state."
9946160,9953160," Okay, so it's literally the seeds but the cells die longer."
9953160,9960160," Oh no, more obscure shit for next year advent of code."
9960160,9965160," Excuse me, did I miss anything?"
9965160,9967160," Oh, you mean..."
9967160,9968160," Ah, I see what you mean."
9968160,9973160," You're referring to me saying that now I can just say Moore's neighborhood and without explaining shit."
9973160,9974160," Yeah."
9974160,9978160," Do these always have the same pattern?"
9978160,9980160," I mean, which ones?"
9980160,9981160," No."
9981160,9983160," Please read more about cell automatons."
9986160,9991160," Okay, so it's literally the same thing, it's just the rules are kind of different."
9991160,10000160," So what I'm thinking, how can we abstract all of that stuff away?"
10002160,10005160," Is there any way for us to abstract it away?"
10005160,10015160," So we can have a single definition of the board across all of these examples, right?"
10015160,10026160," Do the cellar automata have like, like brains, Brian's brain, seed, game of life."
10026160,10028160," Do they have like a name of a class?"
10028160,10033160," They do belong to the same class, same family."
10034160,10038160," So like, like, cellular automaton."
10038160,10044160," A cellular automaton is like, like in the sense of being similar to Conway's game of life."
10044160,10047160," If it meets the following criteria, the array of cells automatically has two dimensions."
10047160,10052160," Each cell automatically has two states convention."
10052160,10057160," So that means that Brian's brain is not really like, like."
10057160,10061160," So what if it has more states?"
10061160,10064160," Like, like."
10064160,10066160," Like, like and subscribe, subscribe."
10066160,10070160," Oh, sorry."
10070160,10075160," Notation for rules."
10077160,10082160," Brian's brain."
10082160,10086160," But Brian's brain, that actually doesn't meet that criteria, right?"
10086160,10088160," Because it has three states."
10088160,10092160," In each time step of the automation, the new state of the cell can be expressed as a function of two."
10092160,10097160," It's common to refer to it."
10097160,10100160," Many different terms are used to describe this class."
10100160,10102160," It is common to refer to a life family."
10102160,10106160," Okay, so I'm going to call them life family because it makes more sense in my opinion."
10107160,10115160," So essentially, I want to take the common code between game of life and seeds."
10115160,10117160," And extract it to a header called, like, life."
10117160,10119160," You convince them."
10119160,10121160," I convince you to do what?"
10121160,10122160," Oh, subscribe."
10122160,10122160," Thank you."
10122160,10125160," Thank you so much for two months of tier one subscription."
10125160,10126160," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
10126160,10128160," And welcome to our..."
10128160,10130160," Oh, subscribe."
10130160,10131160," Oh my God."
10131160,10136160," I'm sorry if I'm saying something stupid because my brain switches context way too fast."
10136160,10137160," Right?"
10137160,10139160," So I already forgot that I was talking about..."
10139160,10141160," That I made a joke like, like, subscribe, subscribe."
10141160,10143160," I was thinking about, like, next..."
10143160,10144160," Next thing that I'm going to do."
10144160,10147160," And I completely throw away this context."
10147160,10148160," So I'm really sorry."
10148160,10150160," But thank you so much for two months of tier one subscription."
10150160,10151160," All right."
10151160,10157160," So what I want to do, I want to actually extract all of that into, like, reusable code."
10157160,10159160," We've got Superina."
10159160,10160160," Oh my God."
10160160,10162160," Thank you so much for Twitch Prime subscription."
10162160,10163160," Your first subscription, by the way."
10163160,10166160," And welcome to our epic A-Tomato Club."
10166160,10169160," All right."
10169160,10170160," So let me..."
10170160,10171160," Let me see."
10171160,10172160," So..."
10172160,10175160," And obviously rule 1-1-0 does not belong to that family."
10175160,10177160," So it's not going to reuse this kind of thing."
10178160,10179160," So..."
10179160,10180160," Okay."
10180160,10184160," So what I'm thinking now..."
10184160,10185160," Is..."
10185160,10193160," We're probably going to have this board definition, but we're not going to have a cell definition."
10193160,10196160," Because different cells may have different states and whatnot."
10196160,10197160," Yeah."
10197160,10202160," And we also can have different ways of computing neighbors."
10202160,10203160," And..."
10203160,10204160," Yeah."
10204160,10205160," All right."
10205160,10207160," Let's do live.h."
10207160,10212160," So it's going to be if and def live.h."
10212160,10214160," Define live.h."
10214160,10219160," And it's going to be end if live.h."
10219160,10222160," So..."
10222160,10225160," Here we keep..."
10225160,10227160," The common..."
10227160,10230160," Code for all of the..."
10230160,10233160," Cellular Automata..."
10233160,10234160," Automata..."
10234160,10237160," From the..."
10237160,10239160," Game of..."
10239160,10241160," Game of Life..."
10241160,10243160," Family..."
10243160,10244160," Family..."
10244160,10248160," So I also want to actually split..."
10248160,10250160," This thing like that."
10250160,10253160," And maybe give a link to..."
10253160,10254160," This article."
10254160,10255160," Right?"
10255160,10256160," To this article."
10256160,10257160," But I'm not even sure if..."
10257160,10259160," A link to this article is a good idea."
10259160,10260160," But I just want to..."
10260160,10261160," You know, mention why..."
10261160,10264160," We have this header at all."
10264160,10265160," All right."
10265160,10266160," And we're going to have a..."
10266160,10268160," Just a board definition."
10268160,10270160," It's going to be just a board."
10270160,10273160," And the thing about this board is that..."
10275160,10277160," We have a cells."
10277160,10279160," And the amount of cells depends on rows and columns."
10279160,10280160," Okay."
10280160,10286160," And one of the things we need to have here..."
10286160,10288160," Is an ability to calculate neighbors."
10288160,10289160," Right?"
10289160,10291160," As you can see, I don't have a type for this cell."
10291160,10294160," Because you may have different kinds of cells here."
10294160,10296160," Board neighbors."
10296160,10297160," So..."
10297160,10300160," Where is the seed?"
10300160,10302160," Where is the seed?"
10302160,10303160," Neighbors."
10303160,10304160," Neighbors."
10304160,10305160," Okay."
10305160,10308160," I'm going to put this thing here."
10308160,10314160," And essentially, we're going to abstract that thing slightly away."
10314160,10318160," We're going to also provide the value of the cell."
10318160,10320160," Which cell we are trying to count."
10320160,10321160," So..."
10321160,10324160," And we're checking if cells equal to cell."
10324160,10325160," You see?"
10325160,10326160," And there we go."
10326160,10327160," We abstracted that away."
10327160,10335160," And now this function is actually reusable among all of the lifelike automata."
10335160,10337160," I don't know how to say that."
10337160,10338160," Sorry."
10338160,10340160," So, next board."
10340160,10342160," Next board is very interesting."
10342160,10353160," I think next board should be more abstract."
10353160,10356160," It should probably accept the rule."
10356160,10357160," Right?"
10357160,10361160," It should probably accept the function that applies the rule."
10361160,10365160," But the question is how we can even do that."
10365160,10366160," So..."
10366160,10367160," Alright."
10367160,10369160," So, let me grab this thing."
10369160,10374160," So, next board takes the previous one and the next one."
10374160,10376160," And then it should take..."
10376160,10382160," Something like a rule."
10382160,10384160," And what this entire thing will accept..."
10384160,10385160," Right?"
10385160,10388160," It will accept a row."
10388160,10393160," Definitely the current row and the current column."
10393160,10398160," And it probably should accept previous and the next board as well."
10398160,10401160," So, it can compute neighbors and whatnot."
10401160,10404160," So, maybe I'm going to put it like that."
10404160,10406160," So, it's going to be a pretty big function."
10406160,10409160," And essentially, how are we going to apply it?"
10409160,10411160," We're going to apply it the following way."
10411160,10412160," We're going to call it rule."
10412160,10415160," Previous next row column."
10415160,10419160," And then we're going to just apply it like this."
10419160,10420160," Boom."
10420160,10423160," And we're going to collapse this entire thing."
10423160,10426160," So, you will have to implement that yourself."
10426160,10427160," Right?"
10427160,10428160," You implement the function rule."
10428160,10429160," You put it there."
10429160,10432160," And it automatically calculates all of that for you."
10432160,10436160," So, we don't really have a cell as a type."
10436160,10446160," But maybe we can at least introduce type def for the cell like this."
10446160,10448160," I'm not sure how good of an idea that is."
10448160,10450160," But I think it's going to be a good idea."
10450160,10454160," Because at least it documents what we are expecting here."
10454160,10455160," Yeah."
10455160,10458160," At least it doesn't really add any type safety."
10458160,10460160," But at least it documents things."
10460160,10461160," Right."
10461160,10462160," And then here."
10462160,10464160," We might as well put it like that."
10464160,10467160," All right."
10467160,10468160," So, this is the next board."
10468160,10469160," This is the neighbors."
10469160,10472160," You can easily reuse all of that for your stuff."
10472160,10474160," Do we need to have anything else?"
10474160,10475160," So, yeah."
10475160,10477160," Render board."
10477160,10479160," It's pretty straightforward."
10479160,10481160," Do we need anything else?"
10481160,10482160," Random."
10482160,10484160," We can try to implement something like random board."
10484160,10485160," But for the random board."
10485160,10488160," You will have to provide the amount of cells you have."
10488160,10489160," Right."
10489160,10490160," So, yeah."
10490160,10491160," This is a random board."
10491160,10492160," You iterate through all of that."
10492160,10496160," And you can have something like."
10496160,10498160," How is it called?"
10498160,10499160," Cell."
10499160,10502160," Count."
10502160,10503160," Cell states."
10503160,10504160," Maybe."
10504160,10505160," Cell states."
10505160,10506160," Cell states."
10506160,10509160," You have to provide something like this."
10509160,10511160," And yeah."
10511160,10512160," Here it is."
10512160,10516160," I think this is the whole thing that we want to abstract away."
10516160,10519160," I don't think we have anything else in here."
10519160,10522160," And obviously this header depends on everything we have in tomato."
10522160,10523160," Right."
10523160,10525160," It depends at least at rows and columns."
10525160,10529160," And I think I can quickly now abstract things away."
10529160,10530160," All right."
10530160,10532160," So, I'm going to just recompile everything."
10532160,10535160," I don't really want to do it like that."
10535160,10536160," All right."
10536160,10537160," Let's start with the game of life."
10537160,10538160," Let's start with the game of life."
10538160,10539160," Let's start with the game of life."
10539160,10548160," And we're probably going to introduce things like dead and alive."
10548160,10549160," Right."
10549160,10551160," We don't need cell in here."
10551160,10555160," And we definitely don't need the board definition anymore."
10555160,10558160," We definitely need a render board."
10558160,10561160," But random board is not needed anymore."
10561160,10565160," Neighbors also not need it anymore."
10565160,10567160," And we definitely don't need the next board."
10567160,10572160," But what we need is a goal rule."
10572160,10573160," Goal rule."
10573160,10576160," Which accepts previous and the next board."
10576160,10580160," Actually, it should accept previous and the next board by const."
10580160,10583160," Because it's not going to modify it."
10583160,10586160," It's not going to modify it."
10586160,10596160," So, it's going to be just const."
10596160,10601160," And also, we accept a row and column."
10601160,10602160," Right."
10602160,10605160," So, and we can extract this entire thing."
10605160,10609160," Like this."
10609160,10610160," To be fair."
10610160,10611160," Wait a second."
10611160,10612160," You don't need next."
10612160,10614160," You definitely don't need next."
10614160,10617160," So, we can just actually never provide it."
10617160,10618160," Yeah."
10618160,10619160," So, rule."
10619160,10621160," You take previous and row and column."
10621160,10623160," And you don't even have to do that."
10623160,10625160," Like, it's simpler than that."
10625160,10627160," Okay."
10627160,10629160," So, then we count the neighbors for the previous one."
10629160,10631160," Then we check everything."
10631160,10636160," And here, we essentially just return things like that."
10638160,10641160," Here, we return it like that."
10641160,10643160," We might as well actually get rid of the brakes."
10643160,10646160," Because return automatically acts like a brake."
10646160,10648160," So, you don't need that."
10648160,10651160," And you don't need a next board."
10653160,10656160," Put glider at is definitely needed in here."
10656160,10657160," Okay."
10657160,10661160," So, that simplified implementation of this thing dramatically."
10661160,10666160," Because the only thing we had to implement is render board."
10666160,10667160," The rule."
10667160,10669160," And also, how to put a glider and whatnot."
10669160,10670160," Right."
10670160,10671160," So, we don't need to do that."
10671160,10671160," We don't need to do that."
10671160,10671160," We don't need to do that."
10671160,10672160," We don't need to do that."
10672160,10673160," We don't need to do that."
10673160,10674160," We don't need to do that."
10674160,10675160," We don't need to do that."
10675160,10676160," We don't need to do that."
10676160,10677160," We don't need to do that."
10677160,10678160," We don't need to do that."
10678160,10679160," We don't need to do that."
10679160,10680160," We don't need to do that."
10680160,10681160," We don't need to do that."
10681160,10682160," We don't need to do that."
10682160,10683160," We don't need to do that."
10683160,10684160," We don't need to do that."
10684160,10685160," We don't need to do that."
10685160,10686160," We don't need to do that."
10686160,10687160," We don't need to do that."
10687160,10688160," We don't need to do that."
10688160,10689160," We don't need to do that."
10689160,10692160," So, let's try to recompile this into, I think."
10692160,10694160," And it's going to fail, obviously."
10694160,10699160," Field omitted."
10699160,10703160," Oh, yeah, because I actually forgot to make it one."
10703160,10704160," All right."
10704160,10706160," So, unknown board."
10706160,10710160," Let's include live.h."
10710160,10711160," Let's include live.h."
10711160,10713160," Do we have anything else here?"
10713160,10714160," Okay."
10714160,10716160," So, and now I don't even."
10716160,10719160," So, in the next board, I don't have to provide the next."
10719160,10722160," because it's my job to handle the next."
10722160,10724160," Too few arguments."
10724160,10726160," Oh, you have to provide which one you're counting."
10726160,10729160," We're counting alive cells."
10729160,10730160," Uh-huh."
10730160,10735160," And return with value function return void."
10735160,10736160," Uh-huh."
10736160,10739160," So, that means I have to return cell in here."
10739160,10740160," Uh-huh."
10740160,10741160," Uh-huh."
10741160,10746160," And now, when I calculate the next board, I have to provide the goal rule."
10746160,10747160," Yes."
10747160,10748160," Yes."
10748160,10750160," I'm just providing the goal rule."
10750160,10751160," Man, that's it."
10751160,10752160," That's actually pretty cool."
10752160,10754160," You know what I'm thinking about?"
10754160,10759160," Since all of this Game of Life's game will have pretty much the same loop."
10759160,10761160," Might as well all subtract it away."
10761160,10777160," Because the only thing they need is essentially a function to initialize your board, the rule, and to render your board."
10777160,10778160," You know what?"
10778160,10779160," Why not?"
10779160,10780160," Why not?"
10780160,10781160," Why not?"
10781160,10782160," Uh..."
10782160,10783160," Yeah."
10783160,10786160," So, we can abstract that shit away as well."
10786160,10787160," Huh."
10787160,10788160," And..."
10788160,10789160," Oh, shit."
10789160,10790160," That's gonna be cool."
10790160,10791160," That's..."
10791160,10791160," That's gonna be cool."
10791160,10792160," Hmm."
10792160,10793160," Okay."
10793160,10794160," Uh..."
10794160,10795160," To..."
10795160,10796160," To the two..."
10796160,10797160," Mm-hmm."
10797160,10798160," Uh..."
10798160,10811160," So, essentially, it's gonna be the following function, right?"
10811160,10812160," Uh..."
10812160,10813160," Something like..."
10813160,10815160," Life..."
10815160,10816160," Uh..."
10816160,10817160," Event..."
10817160,10819160," Event loop."
10819160,10824160," And it will accept, I guess, three main..."
10824160,10825160," Yeah."
10825160,10827160," It will accept three main functions."
10827160,10831160," It will accept, uh, init board, right?"
10831160,10832160," Uh..."
10832160,10833160," Which doesn't do anything."
10833160,10837160," It's just gonna be init board, which accepts your board."
10837160,10838160," Right?"
10838160,10840160," So, it does that."
10840160,10841160," Uh..."
10841160,10842160," The next thing it accepts."
10842160,10843160," It accepts the rule."
10843160,10844160," Uh..."
10844160,10847160," So, and the rule is basically already defined here."
10847160,10849160," So, this is the rule."
10849160,10850160," That is gonna be used."
10850160,10851160," That's gonna be used."
10851160,10852160," Uh..."
10852160,10853160," And..."
10853160,10856160," It also will accept render board."
10856160,10857160," Uh..."
10857160,10858160," So, it's gonna be something like..."
10858160,10859160," Uh..."
10859160,10860160," Render board."
10860160,10862160," Which accepts constant board."
10862160,10864160," And I guess that's it."
10864160,10865160," Yeah."
10865160,10866160," It doesn't accept anything else."
10866160,10868160," So, you only need to implement this kind of stuff."
10868160,10869160," Uh..."
10869160,10870160," Uh..."
10870160,10871160," There we go."
10871160,10873160," And we might as well also..."
10873160,10874160," Yeah."
10874160,10875160," Have an integer here."
10875160,10877160," Which we can use then later."
10877160,10879160," So, the idea is the following."
10879160,10880160," So, I don't have init board."
10880160,10881160," Let me introduce it."
10881160,10884160," So, it's gonna be init board."
10884160,10885160," Board."
10885160,10886160," Board."
10886160,10887160," Board."
10887160,10888160," Right."
10888160,10891160," And in there, I'm gonna actually put this thing."
10891160,10892160," Right."
10892160,10893160," So, here's that."
10893160,10897160," And I can just quickly replace this entire thing."
10897160,10898160," Like this."
10898160,10902160," Here's how we initialize everything."
10902160,10903160," Then I take..."
10903160,10904160," This entire stuff."
10904160,10905160," Uh..."
10905160,10906160," To..."
10906160,10907160," To..."
10907160,10908160," To..."
10908160,10909160," To..."
10909160,10910160," To..."
10910160,10911160," To..."
10911160,10912160," To..."
10912160,10913160," Uh..."
10913160,10914160," Mm-mm-mm-mm..."
10914160,10915160," Why emacs over vim?"
10915160,10916160," This is vim."
10916160,10917160," I don't know what you're talking about."
10917160,10918160," Look."
10918160,10920160," In the title it says vim."
10920160,10921160," So..."
10921160,10922160," It's really a strange question."
10922160,10923160," I don't understand your question."
10923160,10924160," Sorry."
10924160,10925160," It's vim."
10925160,10926160," It's literally vim."
10926160,10927160," Uh..."
10927160,10928160," All right."
10928160,10929160," So, next thing we're gonna do."
10929160,10930160," Uh..."
10930160,10931160," Is gonna be init."
10931160,10932160," Uh..."
10932160,10933160," How do you zoom zoom?"
10933160,10934160," Uh..."
10934160,10935160," I'm using a special application."
10935160,10936160," This one."
10936160,10937160," Uh..."
10937160,10938160," Board."
10938160,10939160," And, um..."
10939160,10940160," We do board fg."
10940160,10941160," Like this."
10941160,10942160," So, we initialize everything."
10942160,10943160," Uh..."
10943160,10944160," And, um..."
10944160,10945160," We do board fg."
10945160,10946160," Like this."
10946160,10947160," So, we initialize everything."
10947160,10948160," Here."
10948160,10950160," And then we have to do this thing here."
10950160,10951160," Uh..."
10951160,10953160," Then we calculate the next board."
10953160,10956160," But we use the rule that is supplied by the user."
10956160,10957160," Right?"
10957160,10958160," And then we render the board."
10958160,10959160," Yeah."
10959160,10960160," We use render the board."
10960160,10963160," And that's pretty much it."
10963160,10967160," And essentially, I can replace this entire stuff with just a function."
10967160,10968160," Life."
10968160,10969160," Event."
10969160,10970160," Loop."
10970160,10971160," Init."
10971160,10972160," Board."
10972160,10973160," Then."
10973160,10974160," Goal."
10974160,10975160," Rule."
10975160,10976160," Then."
10976160,10976160," Render."
10976160,10977160," Board."
10977160,10978160," I can move this entire stuff."
10978160,10979160," Right?"
10979160,10980160," I can move this entire..."
10980160,10983160," I'm not sure what would be the best way to actually do that."
10983160,10986160," I might as well move it here."
10986160,10989160," So, we're gonna have, like, a bunch of these things in here."
10989160,10990160," Uh..."
10990160,10991160," And..."
10991160,10994160," Can I move it to life now?"
10994160,10995160," Yeah."
10995160,10996160," That's pretty cool."
10996160,10997160," Good."
10997160,10998160," Yeah."
10998160,10999160," That's pretty cool."
10999160,11003160," So, now, the entire game of life implementation consists of just how you render the board."
11003160,11005160," Then, the game of life rule."
11005160,11008160," And then, initialization and whatnot."
11008160,11011160," With the initialization, we actually do everything here."
11011160,11013160," And this is the main event loop."
11013160,11021160," And this can be reused across all of the life-like, uh, cellular automata."
11021160,11025160," So, I think that's pretty cool."
11025160,11027160," So, let's see if it compiles."
11027160,11028160," Probably not."
11028160,11030160," But we can always fix that."
11030160,11032160," It compiles first try."
11032160,11033160," What the fuck?"
11033160,11035160," Got cool, by the way."
11035160,11036160," Uh..."
11036160,11037160," So, yeah."
11037160,11038160," Seems to be working."
11038160,11039160," Still working."
11039160,11040160," Cool."
11040160,11042160," Uh..."
11042160,11043160," Now."
11043160,11046160," So, let's do a committee committee."
11046160,11047160," Uh..."
11047160,11061160," Introduce framework for life-like cellular automata."
11061160,11062160," Uh..."
11062160,11064160," I hope I actually spelled it correctly."
11064160,11065160," I think I did."
11065160,11066160," So, I'm going to push that right into the repo."
11066160,11071160," And I'm going to rewrite seeds in terms that think as well."
11071160,11077160," So, uh, what we have to do now, we just need to include, uh, live.h in here."
11077160,11081160," And instead of having this thing, uh, we can define it like that."
11081160,11082160," It's going to be define."
11082160,11085160," And we're going to just remove it like that."
11085160,11086160," And there we go."
11086160,11087160," We have off and on."
11087160,11088160," Uh..."
11088160,11090160," We don't need this definition."
11090160,11092160," We don't need this function."
11092160,11093160," We don't need this function."
11093160,11094160," We don't need this function."
11094160,11098160," Well, we still do need it because we need to, uh, have a rule here."
11098160,11100160," Uh, let's actually, uh, create a rule."
11100160,11101160," So, it's going to be sell."
11101160,11103160," Uh, let's call it seeds rule."
11103160,11110160," Uh, it, uh, accepts the previous state of the board and, uh, roll and column."
11110160,11115160," And, uh, first thing it does, essentially it computes the neighbors."
11115160,11116160," It computes the neighbors."
11116160,11122160," And then, uh, in this particular case, we return on or off."
11122160,11123160," There we go."
11123160,11124160," There we go."
11124160,11125160," That's the whole thing."
11125160,11126160," But we still don't need next board."
11126160,11128160," We do need the render board."
11128160,11130160," Uh, we don't need the random board."
11130160,11131160," That's for sure."
11131160,11133160," Because I'm pretty sure I extracted that."
11133160,11135160," Uh, yeah, I do have it here."
11135160,11136160," So, I don't need that."
11136160,11138160," I definitely don't need that."
11138160,11139160," Uh, seeds event."
11139160,11140160," Okay."
11140160,11141160," This one is interesting."
11141160,11142160," Seeds event callback."
11142160,11160160," The thing about that stuff is, yeah, we can probably make it available on, hmm."
11160160,11165160," This one is complicated because, uh, we need to be, we need to know."
11165160,11171160," Uh, we need to know how many of the cells you can have."
11171160,11181160," Um, maybe we can remove that for now."
11181160,11186160," Uh, so, put glider at, it's one of the, okay."
11186160,11189160," So, put glider at could be actually abstracted away."
11189160,11192160," Uh, I think it could be abstracted away."
11192160,11200160," Basically, put a figure at, um, but apart from that, um, we can do something like this."
11200160,11201160," Um, we can do something like this."
11201160,11202160," Init."
11202160,11203160," Board."
11203160,11204160," Board."
11204160,11205160," Board."
11205160,11206160," Board."
11206160,11209160," And I'm gonna actually copy paste this thing here."
11209160,11213160," And we're just using the board in here."
11213160,11214160," Right."
11214160,11216160," And I think that is it."
11216160,11219160," So, essentially I can now do the phone thing."
11219160,11221160," Life event loop."
11221160,11226160," So, first we emit the board."
11226160,11227160," Then we render the board."
11227160,11229160," Actually, see the rule."
11229160,11234160," Uh, and the last one was the render the board."
11234160,11235160," And there you go."
11235160,11236160," Okay."
11236160,11238160," That organized the event loop for you."
11238160,11241160," Uh, but we still need to do something with this specific thing."
11241160,11243160," And that can be some sure what."
11243160,11244160," Okay."
11244160,11245160," Make minus being."
11245160,11246160," Okay."
11246160,11251160," And do the compile because we don't have the board neighbors."
11251160,11252160," Oh yeah."
11252160,11253160," Board neighbors."
11253160,11254160," Oh yeah."
11254160,11255160," Board neighbors."
11255160,11257160," Accepts what these cells were counting."
11257160,11259160," We're counting, accounting on cells."
11259160,11260160," Right."
11260160,11261160," We're counting on cells."
11261160,11262160," Cool."
11262160,11263160," Okay."
11263160,11267160," And, um, I still need to integrate that into the whole framework."
11267160,11283160," But the problem is that it needs to know, it needs to know how many of the cells we have."
11283160,11288160," Uh, so we need to pass that information to the framework somehow."
11288160,11296160," Well, we can probably pass it here."
11296160,11297160," Right."
11297160,11302160," So we have init board, uh, seed rule, and render board."
11302160,11305160," And I can then say, uh, I have two states of the board."
11305160,11306160," Right."
11306160,11309160," I have two states of the board."
11309160,11311160," Uh, hmm."
11311160,11315160," So, I don't know."
11315160,11317160," That's a good thing."
11317160,11318160," Okay."
11318160,11324160," Or maybe we're going to just assume that, uh, you can only draw between zero and two, which"
11324160,11327160," is kind of a strange assumption, but okay."
11327160,11330160," Um, maybe it's going to be okay for now."
11330160,11337160," Uh, life event loop seeds event call back."
11337160,11345160," Um, hello land words camera."
11345160,11347140," I hope I pronounced your nickname correctly."
11347160,11348160," Um, life event call back."
11348160,11351160," Um, life event call back."
11351160,11354160," Uh, so here is an interesting thing."
11354160,11360160," Um, uh, to do."
11360160,11378160," Um, life event call back assumes that there is only two, uh, there's only two kinds of cells."
11378160,11379160," It's zero and one."
11379160,11383160," Um, which is probably pretty good convention."
11383160,11385160," Um, which is probably pretty good convention."
11385160,11388160," I think this is basically the convention that you have to follow."
11388160,11394160," Uh, if you want to use this framework for the life, for the life thing."
11394160,11395160," Yeah."
11395160,11396160," Right."
11396160,11397160," Uh, if you want to use this framework for the life event."
11397160,11397160," Uh, if you want to use this framework for the life event."
11397160,11398160," Uh, if you want to use this framework for the life event."
11398160,11399160," Uh, if you want to use this framework for the life event."
11399160,11400160," Uh, if you want to use this framework for the life event."
11400160,11401160," Uh, if you want to use this framework for the life event."
11401160,11402160," Okay."
11402160,11404160," So what we have here."
11404160,11408160," Uh, oh, oh, okay."
11408160,11415160," So that means we have to make this board available globally."
11415160,11416160," Yeah."
11416160,11421160," We need to make it globally available, which is, I mean, that's what we do anyway."
11421160,11422160," Uh, yep."
11422160,11429160," So if I try to run seats, uh, this seems to be working and I can also modify all of that."
11429160,11436160," And, uh, I can also put a bunch of oscillators and when they hit the oscillators, they will"
11436160,11437160," become a chaos."
11437160,11439160," It will turn into a chaos."
11439160,11440160," Okay."
11440160,11441160," That makes sense."
11441160,11443160," So I didn't really break things too much."
11443160,11444160," And what's interesting."
11444160,11448160," The side effect of all of that is that now you can also edit game of life, which you couldn't"
11448160,11449160," do before."
11449160,11450160," Right."
11450160,11452160," Because we're using reusing the same framework."
11452160,11453160," Right."
11453160,11457160," So, and it can stop and it can draw some things in here for the game of life."
11457160,11458160," And that will work automatically."
11458160,11460160," And we're using the same framework."
11460160,11463160," It's kind of interesting how we have several layers of frameworks."
11463160,11469160," So first we have a tomato framework, which just gives you a basic event loop and basic drawing"
11469160,11470160," functionality."
11470160,11475160," On top of that, we build another framework, which is a live framework, which gives the ability"
11475160,11478160," to, uh, write life, like several automata."
11478160,11479160," So you see what I did here."
11479160,11481160," So here are two frameworks."
11481160,11484160," Um, first one, automata and the life."
11484160,11485160," So that's pretty cool."
11485160,11489160," Uh, how do I exit?"
11489160,11490160," You press Q."
11490160,11492160," Uh, you have to press Q."
11492160,11493160," Did it work for you?"
11493160,11510160," Uh, did I, did I not document ads?"
11510160,11516160," This one is on you."
11516160,11522160," There is literally huge control stable that documents everything."
11522160,11523160," You didn't read it."
11523160,11524160," This one is on you."
11524160,11526160," I don't even feel bad about you."
11526160,11527160," You deserve that."
11527160,11529160," You literally deserve that."
11529160,11530160," All right."
11530160,11539160," So, um, I was like, I thought for a second that I forgot to document that."
11539160,11540160," No, I do come into that."
11540160,11541160," Okay."
11541160,11542160," Everything's okay."
11542160,11547160," Uh, already."
11547160,11552160," And though you managed to build."
11552160,11553160," Wait a second."
11553160,11555160," You actually downloaded the new compiler."
11555160,11556160," Right."
11556160,11557160," And you build it yourself."
11557160,11559160," That's actually pretty cool."
11559160,11564160," So it actually puts away a lot of people when they see this program, they want to use this"
11564160,11566160," program, but the fact that you have to build it yourself."
11566160,11568160," Uh, oh, you're using Arch."
11568160,11569160," I see."
11569160,11571160," So, I mean, it's probably easier in Arch."
11571160,11576160," Um, and also, yeah, you can only use it on Linux."
11576160,11582160," Unfortunately, it literally doesn't work on Linux because it uses very specific Linux functionality,"
11582160,11584160," uh, which is not available on Windows."
11584160,11591160," But on Windows, you have a lot of other similar things that are probably better."
11591160,11593160," Uh, all right."
11593160,11598160," So, so now we have that."
11598160,11599160," Okay."
11599160,11612160," Rewrite seats using the live framework."
11612160,11616160," I'm not sure if I'm doing a good job."
11616160,11618160," Uh, Windows has a building magnifying thing."
11618160,11619160," Okay."
11619160,11625160," So, but is it as good as Boomer that can do things like that?"
11625160,11627160," And wow, wow, wow, wow."
11627160,11628160," Probably."
11628160,11629160," I don't know."
11629160,11631160," I haven't used Windows for quite some time already."
11631160,11632160," Maybe it's better."
11632160,11633160," Okay."
11633160,11635160," So, we're going to have a Brian's brain."
11635160,11636160," Uh, does it already?"
11636160,11638160," It doesn't really build automatically."
11638160,11639160," Brian's brain."
11639160,11640160," Okay."
11640160,11641160," Let's try to do that."
11641160,11642160," Doesn't have the flashlight feature."
11642160,11643160," Hmm."
11643160,11644160," Too bad."
11644160,11645160," Too bad."
11645160,11646160," Too bad."
11646160,11647160," Hmm."
11647160,11648160," So, yeah, there we go."
11648160,11649160," We have a Brian's brain."
11649160,11656160," So, the, the thing we need to do now, uh, we need to include a tomato and the life."
11656160,11676160," So, essentially I'm going to define the following states of the cells."
11676160,11677160," Off is going to be zero."
11677160,11679160," On is going to be one."
11679160,11682160," And, uh, dying is going to be two."
11682160,11683160," Right."
11683160,11690160," So, and the reason why I'm defining them like that is because the convention is zero is"
11690160,11691160," dead."
11691160,11693160," One, uh, is on."
11693160,11694160," Right."
11694160,11698160," And, uh, all of the controls are built between, like, around these conventions."
11698160,11700160," That's why I have to do it like that."
11700160,11703160," Um, but it does have TTS."
11703160,11706160," Does Boomer have TTS?"
11706160,11709160," No, it doesn't."
11709160,11712160," Um, it doesn't have to, unfortunately."
11712160,11713160," All right."
11713160,11715160," So let me see."
11715160,11722160," Um, oh, by the way, I need to be able to actually ignore all of these things."
11722160,11723160," Yeah."
11723160,11727160," So essentially, if you need board is not available."
11727160,11728160," Okay."
11728160,11729160," Sure."
11729160,11730160," Sure."
11730160,11731160," Sure."
11731160,11732160," Sure."
11732160,11733160," Sure."
11733160,11737160," Uh, life event call back."
11737160,11738160," So rule."
11738160,11739160," Uh huh."
11739160,11740160," Render board."
11740160,11741160," Uh huh."
11741160,11742160," Render board."
11742160,11743160," Uh huh."
11743160,11744160," Render board."
11744160,11745160," Uh huh."
11745160,11746160," Next board."
11746160,11747160," Okay."
11747160,11748160," This one is interesting, actually."
11748160,11749160," Hmm."
11749160,11750160," If there's no rule, we should probably do nothing."
11750160,11751160," If rule."
11751160,11752160," Yeah."
11752160,11765160," So essentially, the reason why I'm doing all of that is that because I want to use this function"
11765160,11772160," I want to provide nuls for all of them and I want this stuff to work."
11772160,11773160," Hello Drucker."
11773160,11774160," Look."
11774160,11777160," Imagine get a bit of data that don't work on windows."
11777160,11779160," Imagine using windows."
11779160,11780160," Uh huh."
11780160,11781160," Uh huh."
11781160,11782160," Got it."
11782160,11783160," Got it."
11783160,11784160," Got it."
11784160,11785160," Got it."
11785160,11786160," Um."
11786160,11787160," Alright."
11787160,11788160," So what do we get?"
11788160,11789160," Um."
11789160,11794160," So this one is gonna be, uh, null for now."
11794160,11795160," Hmm."
11795160,11799160," I'm using debian stable."
11799160,11800160," Uh."
11800160,11804160," I'm curious which branch works better on desktop PC."
11804160,11805160," I have no idea."
11805160,11806160," Uh."
11806160,11807160," So here's my approach."
11807160,11808160," Right."
11808160,11810160," I'm just using debian stable."
11810160,11817160," So, and every time I need a fresh software, I literally build myself from scratch."
11817160,11818160," Uh."
11818160,11820160," Outside of the package manager."
11820160,11829160," And I just install it at, um, slash user slash, uh, local."
11829160,11830160," I think, I think, yeah."
11830160,11832160," So basically I installed there."
11832160,11833160," Um."
11833160,11834160," So yeah."
11834160,11835160," Hmm."
11835160,11836160," Um."
11836160,11842160," So I used a lot of different distros and I kind of got tired of, you know, different pros"
11842160,11844160," and cons of the distros."
11844160,11850160," So I just settled on one distro that just gives me an environment, some sort of environment."
11850160,11856160," And I just adapt this environment to my needs myself without relying too much on repos, uh,"
11856160,11857160," and stuff like that."
11857160,11860160," So if, if, if the software that I need is available in repos."
11860160,11861160," Cool."
11861160,11862160," I'm going to use it."
11862160,11865160," Uh, but quite often in case of a debian stable, it doesn't."
11865160,11866160," So I just build myself."
11866160,11867160," It's just easy."
11867160,11868160," Pretty much use debian like slackware."
11868160,11868160," Um, yeah."
11868160,11881160," And I don't really care about specific distro."
11881160,11884160," I just need a kernel, Linux kernel and shell."
11884160,11887160," And then I can just build everything myself."
11887160,11891160," Um, alrighty."
11891160,11894160," So we're not going to initialize."
11894160,11895160," We need to come up with the rule."
11895160,11896160," Okay."
11896160,11901160," So, um, so I'm going to call this thing PB."
11901160,11903160," So it's going to stay for Brian's brain."
11903160,11906160," Um, I'm sorry, by the way."
11906160,11907160," Thank you."
11907160,11909160," Thank you for telling us that you're using Arch."
11909160,11910160," I really appreciate it."
11910160,11913160," Uh, classic, classic Amirat."
11913160,11915160," Um, alright."
11915160,11922160," Uh, I have found debian to be quite nice in terms of the software provided in the core."
11922160,11923160," Hmm."
11923160,11925160," Hmm, probably."
11925160,11930160," So, oh, by the way, rule is supposed to return a cell."
11930160,11933160," Yeah, I think I did a fucky walky in here."
11934160,11935160," Okay."
11935160,11939160," So, uh, what's the rules of the Brian's brain?"
11939160,11940160," Brian's brain."
11940160,11942160," Where is my Brian's brain?"
11942160,11943160," Here it is."
11943160,11944160," Here's the Brian's brain."
11944160,11950160," Um, so all the cells that were on go into dying."
11950160,11952160," Alright."
11952160,11956160," So, uh, probably need to compute the neighbors first."
11956160,11959160," const int and bors."
11959160,11964160," Um, it's going to be board, board neighbors."
11964160,11969160," Uh, previous row column and I'm counting actually on."
11969160,11970160," Right."
11970160,11983160," If the cell row, uh, column, uh, equal to, equal to off."
11983160,11984160," Right."
11984160,11988160," If it's equal to off, uh, it becomes on."
11988160,11990160," If it has exactly two neighbors, right?"
11990160,11995160," Uh, all cells that were on."
11995160,11998160," Two neighbors become on."
11998160,11999160," Okay."
11999160,12005160," So, um, return neighbors equal to, it becomes on."
12005160,12007160," Otherwise it stays off."
12007160,12008160," Right."
12008160,12012160," Uh, if this thing, I might as well actually do a switch here."
12012160,12015160," I think switch would work a little bit better for this particular case."
12015160,12016160," I think."
12016160,12019160," I think switch is actually good."
12019160,12021160," So, case off."
12021160,12022160," Nice."
12022160,12027160," Case on, uh, always return dying."
12027160,12029160," Uh, case dying."
12029160,12031160," Always return off."
12031160,12032160," Uh, yep."
12032160,12033160," There we go."
12033160,12035160," So that's pretty much the rules of Brian's brain."
12035160,12036160," Pretty much the rules."
12036160,12037160," Uh, yeah."
12037160,12038160," We're going to put a BB, BB rule in here."
12038160,12039160," So, and another thing we need to implement."
12039160,12040160," We need to implement a render board."
12040160,12041160," Render board."
12041160,12042160," So it's going to take a board."
12042160,12043160," And, uh, we just need to render it."
12043160,12044160," Um, all right."
12044160,12045160," Yeah."
12045160,12046160," Um, all right."
12046160,12047160," Yeah."
12047160,12048160," Um, all right."
12048160,12049160," Yeah."
12049160,12051160," So, um, let's put a BB, BB rule in here."
12051160,12052160," So, and another thing we need to implement."
12052160,12053160," We need to implement a render board."
12053160,12054160," Render board."
12054160,12056160," So it's going to take a board and, uh, we just need to render it."
12056160,12057160," To render it."
12057160,12058160," I already watched it."
12058160,12059160," Read my message."
12059160,12060160," Baby rule."
12060160,12061160," Yeah."
12061160,12062160," Um, all right."
12062160,12063160," So, um."
12063160,12064160," Okay."
12064160,12065160," So it's going to be a row."
12065160,12066160," Zero row less than rows."
12066160,12067160," Plus plus row."
12067160,12069160," I might as well actually do something like column."
12069160,12070160," Column less than columns."
12070160,12071160," Plus plus row."
12071160,12073160," I might as well actually do something like column."
12073160,12074160," Column less than columns."
12074160,12075160," Plus plus row."
12075160,12076160," I might as well actually do something like column."
12076160,12077160," Column less than columns."
12077160,12078160," Plus plus row."
12078160,12079160," I might as well actually do something like column."
12079160,12080160," Column less than columns."
12080160,12081160," Plus plus row."
12081160,12082160," I might as well actually do something like column."
12082160,12083160," Column less than columns."
12083160,12084160," Column less than columns."
12084160,12085160," Column less than columns."
12085160,12087160," Plus plus column."
12087160,12090160," And, uh, the way we're going to do all of that."
12090160,12091160," Okay."
12091160,12094160," So we need a mapping between different states of the cell."
12094160,12095160," Right."
12095160,12098160," So, uh, it's going to be uint32."
12098160,12099160," Cell color."
12099160,12101160," And we're going to have three of them."
12101160,12103160," We're going to have three of them."
12103160,12108160," So off is going to be, uh, background."
12108160,12113160," Uh, yes."
12113160,12116160," Yeah, but PTTB is like, um, okay."
12116160,12118160," On is going to be foreground."
12118160,12119160," And we're going to have three of them."
12119160,12120160," And we're going to have three of them."
12120160,12121160," And we're going to have three of them."
12121160,12122160," And we're going to have three of them."
12122160,12123160," And we're going to have three of them."
12123160,12124160," And we're going to have three of them."
12124160,12125160," And we're going to have three of them."
12125160,12126160," And we're going to have three of them."
12126160,12127160," And we're going to have three of them."
12127160,12128160," And we're going to have four of them."
12128160,12129160," And we're going to have three of them."
12129160,12130160," And we're going to have three of them."
12130160,12131160," And we're going to have three of them."
12131160,12132160," And we're going to have three of them."

12174160,12198160," And we're going to have three of them."
12198160,12200160," This one is on Twitch."
12200160,12203160," My internet was absolutely fine."
12203160,12205160," My internet was absolutely fine."
12205160,12206160," It didn't even reconnect."
12206160,12211160," I just saw like insane amount of apps instantly."
12211160,12213160," And no reconnection has happened."
12213160,12216160," So this one is literally on Twitch."
12216160,12217160," Oh, thank you."
12217160,12218160," Thank you."
12218160,12219160," Thank you."
12219160,12220160," All right."
12220160,12221160," Yeah."
12221160,12223160," This one is on Twitch."
12223160,12224160," I don't know what's going on."
12224160,12226160," They probably broke something recently."
12226160,12229160," All right."
12229160,12232160," So does it compile?"
12232160,12233160," Okay."
12233160,12242160," So the control reaches and we can put some sort of assert here."
12242160,12247160," I might as well actually put it into the default one."
12247160,12248160," Right."
12248160,12257160," So it's going to be assert false BB rule unreachable."
12257160,12258160," Something like that."
12258160,12260160," And assumes."
12260160,12263160," Well, it's not a bad name for this thing either."
12263160,12264160," Okay."
12264160,12264160," So we don't have assert."
12264160,12264160," I need to include that here."
12264160,12264160," Might as well actually just build."
12264160,12278160," I don't like how huge this name is."
12278160,12279160," I'm going to call BB."
12279160,12280160," Emacs."
12280160,12281160," Emacs."
12281160,12282160," Emacs."
12282160,12283160," Brian's brain."
12283160,12284160," Uh huh."
12284160,12285160," So this is BB."
12285160,12285160," Okay."
12285160,12285160," I should probably only build BB."
12285160,12286160," Okay."
12286160,12287160," So here's BB."
12287160,12288160," And I'm going to pause it."
12288160,12289160," And I cannot set anything in here."
12289160,12290160," Okay."
12290160,12291160," That it didn't work at all."
12291160,12291160," Oh, this is because it's a bad name."
12291160,12292160," Yeah."
12292160,12293160," Yeah."
12293160,12293160," It didn't work at all."
12293160,12294160," Oh, this is because it's not a bad name."
12294160,12295160," It's not a bad name."
12295160,12296160," It's not a bad name."
12296160,12297160," It's not a bad name."
12297160,12298160," Okay."
12298160,12299160," So here's BB."
12299160,12316160," And I'm going to pause it and I cannot set anything in here."
12316160,12317160," Okay."
12317160,12319160," It didn't work at all."
12319160,12323160," Oh, this is because I didn't set the render board."
12323160,12324160," Okay."
12324160,12325160," Render board."
12325160,12327160," So let's actually set the render board."
12327160,12331160," We'll go to pause and still doesn't up because I didn't rebuild."
12331160,12332160," Of course."
12332160,12333160," Sure."
12333160,12336160," Uh huh."
12336160,12343160," So now we can set these things and let's see what's going to happen."
12343160,12349160," So essentially the pink ones are alive and the blue ones are dying."
12349160,12355160," So, and we can, we can only add the pink ones, but that creates a pretty interesting pattern,"
12355160,12359160," which also dies out, which also dies out."
12359160,12368160," Uh, and it creates a lot of, uh, a lot of, that's, that's actually super cool."
12368160,12369160," Holy shit."
12369160,12370160," Wait a second."
12370160,12376160," If you go, if you make them in diagonal, that is so cool."
12376160,12377160," That is so cool."
12377160,12378160," Let me show you."
12378160,12381160," I'm not sure if how visible it is."
12381160,12389160," I'm not sure how visible it is, but, um, essentially, uh, rows, let's make them 10 by 10, right?"
12389160,12393160," We're going to make them 10 by 10 and I'm going to slow down the whole thing."
12393160,12396160," And we're going to see what's going to happen."
12396160,12397160," Right."
12397160,12398160," So, okay."
12398160,12409160," So if I make them like this, this is so cool."
12409160,12421160," Uh, uh, so if we make it, so if you make it super fast, actually, uh, yeah."
12421160,12424160," Yeah."
12424160,12427160," What if I make it like that?"
12427160,12430160," It's, it's, it's cool how it just fades away or something."
12430160,12433160," Uh, but how can you make like a stable pattern?"
12433160,12437160," Um, that is so cool."
12437160,12438160," Um, all right."
12438160,12443160," So maybe we can use a random, um, random board."
12443160,12448160," So this is a pretty interesting, uh, pretty interesting rule."
12448160,12449160," I would say."
12449160,12450160," I would say."
12450160,12455160," Uh, uh, uh, uh."
12464160,12465160," What are the cellular automata rules?"
12465160,12469160," Uh, we are currently exploring, uh, Brian's brain."
12469160,12478160," Uh, so, um, so this is what we're currently exploring."
12478160,12480160," I, I cannot even type, unfortunately."
12480160,12485160," Can somebody please issue the project command, uh, where we have links to all of these cellular"
12485160,12486160," automata."
12486160,12488160," Um, thank you."
12488160,12489160," Thank you."
12489160,12490160," Thank you so much."
12490160,12491160," Thank you."
12491160,12493160," So you can find all the links there, right?"
12493160,12495160," You can find all the links there."
12495160,12496160," Um, cool."
12496160,12502160," So what I need to do here, I need to be able to initialize the center."
12502160,12503160," I think."
12503160,12507160," Uh, so I, we do have a random board."
12507160,12511160," I wish she had partial application."
12511160,12515160," Uh, I wish she had partial application."
12515160,12518160," Uh, but unfortunately it just doesn't really work that way."
12518160,12522160," Um, okay."
12522160,12524160," So cell state."
12524160,12529160," And, um, it's not the automation."
12529160,12530160," It's automaton."
12530160,12531160," It's automated."
12531160,12532160," Yes."
12532160,12536160," Uh, it's board, board, board."
12536160,12539160," And we're going to just put it like that."
12539160,12541160," And I'm going to first."
12541160,12542160," Yeah."
12542160,12545160," So you see what I have to do here."
12545160,12552160," Look, I'm passing in need board."
12552160,12559160," I need board as a function that calls another function and defines one value."
12559160,12560160," Why?"
12560160,12563160," I wanted to do a partial application."
12563160,12567160," Where is my bake?"
12567160,12569160," How do you do bake in Jaya?"
12569160,12570160," I don't remember."
12570160,12571160," I don't remember."
12571160,12574160," So I think it's something like, uh, in need board."
12574160,12575160," I think you can even do it like that."
12575160,12581160," So bake, um, random, random board."
12581160,12582160," Right."
12582160,12586160," And you can probably, I don't remember if this is how we do that, but."
12586160,12589160," So yeah, it will generate like a new function or something."
12589160,12592160," Unfortunately, this is not Jaya."
12592160,12593160," Uh, bake."
12593160,12596160," It's a partial application in Jaya, but I don't remember how to use it."
12596160,12597160," Unfortunately."
12597160,12598160," Oh shit."
12598160,12602160," Holy fuck."
12602160,12603160," This is so cool."
12604160,12605160," Oh shit."
12605160,12605160," That is way better than seeds."
12605160,12606160," Seeds just very chaotic."
12606160,12607160," It is very chaotic."
12607160,12608160," This one."
12608160,12609160," Like it has structures."
12609160,12610160," Holy fuck."
12610160,12611160," This is so cool."
12611160,12612160," Oh my God."
12612160,12619840," than seeds seeds just very chaotic it is very chaotic this one like it has structures holy"
12619840,12627520," this is so cool oh my god i love it it actually creates a very beautiful structures and"
12627520,12634080," oh i wonder if it's gonna die out at some point probably gonna die out oh no"
12634080,12638960," and it actually creates more interesting stuff than game of life"
12641360,12652000," nice i like how copy gets when he makes something shiny yeah i guess i'm a huge child"
12652000,12666640," really cool saying thanks for making it for us you're welcome"
12669280,12672640," that's so cool you can post it at any point"
12672640,12676800," i wish i could explore more"
12676800,12680320," but i feel a little bit tired"
12680320,12690560," so yeah i think it's time for me to go boys and girls i've been streaming like for five hours several"
12690560,12696240," days already and it's kind of difficult for me to maintain this space look at that look at that"
12696240,12704000," look at that diamond holy so yeah i guess i'm gonna finish the stream here i'm really sorry that i"
12704000,12710480," didn't manage to find any time to explore the gas thingy or other things maybe we're going to explore"
12710480,12719680," them um more in the future i know we can make another another you know several automata stream tomorrow why"
12719680,12726320," not sounds like a pretty cool idea since we have like a whole list of these things uh we can might"
12726320,12731840," as well just go through them so yeah let's actually make another one of the streams tomorrow all right"
12731840,12736240," so uh tomorrow we're going to continue like developing more of these automata's automata's"
12736240,12741920," yeah that's it for today thanks everyone who's watching right now i really appreciate it have a good"
12741920,12747120," one see you tomorrow we're going to continue doing this thing i've made this made the decision uh check"
12747120,12752720," out our schedule which is completely irrelevant because i stopped following it uh check out uh the"
12752720,12757520," source code of this thing thing by the way check out the source code of this thing uh so it's a way up"
12757520,12763520," god damn it okay so i don't have a ability to send messages let me restart my chat arena let me"
12763520,12773840," restart my chat just a second so yeah yeah you can find the source code in here uh schedule it's dying"
12773840,12783600," it's dying oh no uh check out the votes channel uh we upload the um the votes there and check out our"
12783600,12788320," discord server for offline discussion with the community yeah i'm gonna commit it let me actually"
12788320,12795760," commit it right now uh so i don't forget to do that so i'm gonna git ignore uh bb and it's also gonna be"
12795760,12811120," read me so uh like this and implement brian's brain and i'm gonna push that right into the repo um"
12813200,12822240," so should be available now and yeah that's it for today that's it for the boys and girls and i see you"
12822240,12835200," all uh tomorrow love you"
