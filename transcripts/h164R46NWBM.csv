0,6640," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session with Amista Azozun."
6640,12160," Today we're looking at a very interesting thing actually, it is called M4."
12160,15880," So it's a macro language, not the thing you thought."
15880,21360," Right, it's a general purpose macro processor included in most Unix-like operating systems."
21360,25700," And maybe you never actually heard about this thing, and maybe you did, right."
25700,29300," If you're a hardcore Linux nerd, you probably know what it is."
29720,31580," And if you don't, you probably don't, right."
31580,33780," It's kind of like a very interesting niche thing."
33780,40660," But essentially, it's something that the C preprocessor is kind of modeled after."
40660,46400," Right, imagine a slightly more, maybe not even slightly, but on steroids,"
46400,51940," C preprocessor that is not bound to C itself, but you can use on its own."
51940,53260," Imagine that."
53260,56120," This is M4, right."
56240,63140," It's basically a more powerful C preprocessor that is not a part of C, and you can just use it on its own."
63140,65300," And it has a slightly different syntax."
65300,70620," It doesn't require hashes and stuff like that, but you can just define a variable, as you can see."
70620,72420," So here we are defining a variable."
72420,76420," And then you can just use this variable throughout the code, right."
76420,86780," So it's not really used very much in many places, but it has a few niches."
86780,92020," It has a few niches where it is actively used, specifically in auto-tune."
92020,93680," Yeah, people know, people know."
93680,103280," So it's kind of like not really used very much anymore, but it kind of settled in these very specific niches that it's just like used very, very fucking actively."
103280,108180," And outside of these niches, it kind of died out, and nobody really cares about it anymore."
108180,116920," Right, if you want to use auto-tools, and auto-tools is basically the generator of building scripts, of generator of building scripts, of generator of building scripts."
116920,119760," It's the kind of CMake-style thingy, right."
119760,123860," So this is the CMake before we had CMake, essentially, right."
123860,132640," And to generate scripts that generate scripts that generate scripts, this is a very good place where you can use M4, actually, right."
132640,134300," So because it makes it a little bit easier."
134300,139580," Right, so what I want you to do, I want you to actually not only look into it, right."
139580,146500," I would like to, yeah, there was a very weird idea that we had on Discord."
146920,153340," Is that I would review this weird language, and also try to do a Rayleap speedrun on it."
153340,161820," Maybe not speedrun, but can I try to use Rayleap from this weird language, right."
161820,166280," So because Rayleap is so goddamn fucking cross-platform, you can use Rayleap from anything."
166280,168220," Okay, can you use it in M4?"
168220,172100," So, yeah."
172520,180060," But what's interesting is that I don't think you can on its own, but M4 is open source."
183740,193780," So that means, theoretically, you can maybe add some commands that, you know, call some Rayleap functions."
193780,197720," Because at least I think, at least GNU M4 is written in C."
197720,204680," And since it's written in C, that means potentially, potentially I can link it with Rayleap, right."
204840,207580," So, and yeah, so that may work."
207580,210500," So, does that sound interesting?"
210500,223460," So, that gives us an opportunity to look at an old, interesting macro language, explore its source code, modify it, and then try to extend it."
223460,225820," So, I think that sounds interesting, right."
225820,227480," So, let's go ahead and do that."
227560,233880," So, and it's also a good exercise in working with somebody else's source code, right."
233880,237220," It's kind of similar to what we did with memcached video."
237220,238700," Do you guys remember that?"
238700,242080," I think, so let me actually go to YouTube."
242080,245560," If YouTube even opens, because it's kind of banned in Russia, right."
245560,247480," So, well, it's not banned, it's slowed down."
247480,250260," So, quite often I can't even open it."
250260,251840," As you can see, it doesn't even open."
252500,259160," Right, so, but one of the things I can do actually is maybe, I just put a todo for myself, right."
259160,264600," So, to be done, link to memcached video, right."
264600,271080," So, and it's basically the video, the stream where we explore the source code of memcached and we're extending it and stuff like that."
271080,275160," And before, M4 requires a very specific autotools version to build."
275160,278900," That would be funny, right."
278900,280140," That would be funny if that happens."
280140,283760," But, I mean, it is what it is and it isn't what it is and this is a live stream."
283760,285240," Anything can happen in here."
285240,286700," Literally anything can happen."
286700,288240," So, let's go."
288240,293020," So, let's maybe start with taking a look at M4 itself."
293020,295000," Let's not try to extend it."
295000,297540," Let's try to learn it because I don't fucking know it, right."
297540,304120," So, I'm about to extend something that I don't know how to fucking use because I usually don't do any autotools, right."
304120,305200," So, I usually work with CMA."
305200,308040," So, we don't even have M4."
308840,309980," That's a great start."
309980,311320," That's a great start."
311320,315260," How are you supposed to try to modify something that you don't even have in store?"
315260,316380," Right."
316380,318040," So, here is my root console."
318040,319440," Can I do XPS query?"
319440,321040," Query."
321040,321520," R."
321520,322700," Jesus."
322700,323120," R."
323120,323640," S."
323640,325740," M4."
325740,326560," Do we have M4?"
326560,327100," Yeah."
327100,327980," We do have M4."
327980,328240," Okay."
328240,329520," So, let's actually do install."
329520,331840," And hopefully, that will install that shit."
333200,333600," Okay."
333600,336540," So, now we do, in fact, have M4."
336540,339700," It doesn't do anything."
339700,343360," I suppose it probably reads the standard input."
343360,345060," That's probably what happens."
345060,352400," Usually, when you start some Unix programs and they don't do anything and they feel like they hang, they are looking for some input."
352760,355120," Maybe it is actually looking for some of the commands."
355120,357460," Can I just put this thing?"
357460,358400," Oh, yeah."
358400,359660," I was just copy-pasting it in here."
359660,360100," There we go."
360100,361520," So, I copy-pasted this thing in here."
361520,363760," And then I can do H2 count."
363760,364180," Right."
364180,365240," So, I input that."
366020,366280," Okay."
366280,370140," So, it can actually not only work as the C preprocessor."
370140,371760," It can actually stream."
371760,374400," That's actually kind of cool."
374400,378420," So, you can even, like, send this thing over the network."
378420,383680," And it will just render the document as it receives the M4 script."
383680,385240," This is kind of cool, actually."
385240,387800," This is kind of cool."
387800,389260," All right."
389260,390880," So, we have that."
391460,397200," But I wonder if I put some of that stuff to, you know, to a file."
397200,398380," How do you work with that?"
398380,401220," So, M4, it does, in fact, accept the file."
401220,401520," Right."
401520,402880," So, it does, in fact, accept the file."
402880,406800," So, maybe we can actually just create some sort of a thing in here."
406800,407820," So, it's going to be a program."
407820,410000," So, prob."
410000,410620," Right."
410620,411940," So, we're probing some stuff in here."
411940,412740," So, this is garbage."
412740,413900," I want to actually remove that."
413900,415520," Right."
415520,417200," So, we don't care about it."
417200,418600," M4."
419440,423060," And in here, as far as I know, you literally use M4."
423060,423580," Yeah."
423580,425500," You literally use M4 extension."
425500,431440," So, an Emacs, being an old S editor, it does have a highlight for old S macrosystem."
431440,433540," So, it all makes sense."
433540,435080," So, let's actually define something."
435080,435660," Right."
435660,436440," Can we define..."
436440,438640," Yeah."
438640,440740," So, we can define nice."
440740,443700," And nice is going to be 69."
443700,444220," Right."
444220,446400," And then you say, put nice in here."
446400,446980," Right."
446980,448920," So, we'll do M4 main M4."
448920,450280," And there we go."
450280,452000," So, that actually creates all of that."
452000,454560," It also created a bunch of new lines in here."
454560,455720," Look at that."
455720,457960," So, it created a bunch of new lines."
457960,462100," And I suppose these new lines correspond to these lines."
462100,466960," Because it kind of, I guess, interprets this entire thing literally."
466960,468160," Literally."
469300,471060," So, and I remember there was..."
471060,471240," Yeah."
471240,472900," So, there is a thing called DNL."
472900,476740," DNL macro causes M4 to discard the rest of the line."
476740,482120," Thus, preventing unwanted blank lines from appearing in the output."
482120,488120," It's a classical case of a software doing some stupid fucking default shit."
488120,490300," And you have to explicitly disable..."
492760,497080," Old software do be like that."
497080,497420," Right."
497420,501040," So, old software usually have some stupid defaults."
501040,505060," And usually, you have to disable those defaults explicitly."
505060,510540," That's a very good sign of old software from the times where people didn't really care much about UX."
510540,512300," Right."
512440,514380," So, it's just like, whatever."
514380,519120," I suppose the thing we can do in here, we can put DNL and DNL in here."
519120,519780," Oh, look at that."
519780,522160," The moon actually highlights it as a comment."
522160,523060," Right."
523060,524600," So, I can just put it in here."
524600,527160," And if I try to do something else, it doesn't include all of this line."
527160,535000," So, if you don't want a certain command to create an empty line, right, just put this thing in here."
535640,542140," Man, it kind of reminds me of the joke that I did about WinAPI."
542140,546300," Because WinAPI is also old shit API, old ass shit API."
546300,554800," And it also suffers from the same shitty default that nobody gives a fuck about that you have to explicitly disable."
554800,556280," Otherwise, it's going to fuck you up."
556280,558720," It suffers from the same kind of syndrome."
558720,565340," And I remember, like, joking on the Twitter, but I can't find the tweet exactly that."
565340,569700," The way you have to use Windows API, you have to do, like, file open."
569700,570620," Right."
570620,573360," So, the file name, read mode."
573360,580060," And then you have to say, okay, don't nuke my house."
580060,580480," Right."
580480,585140," So, and if you forget to put this mask in here, well, it's going to nuke your house."
585140,589700," That's right, because, like, obviously, file open nukes your house by default."
589700,592040," Obviously, you have to disable it."
592040,593380," Like, you dummy dumbed it."
593380,594900," You didn't read documentation?"
594900,596620," Like, why did you try to read documentation?"
596620,599520," Like, obviously, it fucking nukes your house."
599520,601900," Obviously, it fucking does."
601900,603400," You have to disable that."
603400,604040," Right."
604040,605280," It's all on you."
605280,606160," It's all."
606160,607520," We don't suck at UX."
607520,608960," Excuse me."
608960,610280," We put that into documentation."
610280,612340," You just didn't read it."
612340,613800," So, it's all on you."
615140,618060," It kind of reminds me of that."
618060,621600," And WinAPI is, like, is, like, that, like, everywhere."
621600,623300," Right."
623300,624940," Don't close randomly, exactly."
624940,628760," Anyways."
628760,631780," So, this is the thing we have."
631780,634840," And there's, like, a lot of different macros in here."
634840,637100," So, you can do defines and stuff like that."
637100,640380," But as far as I know, you can also do recursion, don't you?"
641080,642300," That would be actually kind of interesting."
642300,643440," So, M4 manual."
643440,645020," Oh, my God."
645020,645460," No, no."
645460,646420," I'm blind."
646420,647320," Well, fuck's sake."
647320,650040," So, I don't know."
650040,653480," Is there maybe..."
653480,655460," Like, I guess we have to suffer through that."
655460,655800," Right."
655800,656840," So, I guess we have to suffer."
658300,663700," So, invoking in 4, how to invoke macros, how to define new macros is there."
663700,664460," I'm interested."
664460,665200," Wait, wait."
665200,666560," There's an if-else."
666560,668540," If-else."
668540,671180," So, there was an if-else."
671820,672840," So, if-def."
672840,674260," Uh-huh, uh-huh."
674260,679560," So, you can define who is defined and then define and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
679560,683900," So, I don't really want to install Dark Reader, honestly."
683900,687600," I could install it, but it just makes everything freaking slow."
687600,690180," And didn't I install it already at some point?"
690180,691520," I don't freaking remember."
691520,693180," I don't freaking remember."
693180,694240," Let's install Dark Reader."
696580,697280," Debit card."
697280,697660," Pay."
697660,699720," But, I mean, I just want to install it."
699720,701860," Add to Firefox."
701860,703280," All right."
703280,704700," Add it already."
704700,705240," Jesus."
705240,705960," Okay."
705960,706520," Go away."
706520,707380," All right."
707380,708160," So, we got that."
708160,710420," So, was edited."
710420,710960," Go away."
710960,711360," Thank you."
711360,711920," Thank you so much."
711920,712680," I really appreciate that."
712680,715900," So, what I'm interested in is recursion."
715900,716960," Okay."
716960,718500," Conditional loops and recursion."
718500,725180," So, macros expanding to plain text, perhaps, with arguments, are not quite enough."
725280,730640," We would like to have macros expand to different things based on decision taken at runtime."
730640,733500," For that, we'll need some kind of conditionals."
733500,734080," Oh, okay."
734080,734880," That makes sense."
734880,738120," Like, recursion by itself is kind of useless, right?"
738120,740100," So, unless you can stop it, right?"
740100,743560," So, the recursion that doesn't stop, like, you can't do anything useful with that."
743560,745060," All right."
745060,746440," So, okay."
746440,748160," So, you do div dev."
748160,752840," You can check that a certain variable is defined, right?"
752920,755280," So, as defined, then you can print something upon that."
755280,757860," So, construct a multi-branch."
757860,759300," You can do if-else."
759300,762880," You can chain if-else, which is understandable."
762880,765020," But I'm interested in recursion specifically."
765020,765300," Okay."
765300,765780," Recursion."
765780,768300," There's no direct support for loops."
768300,771180," For loops."
771180,771960," Ah-ha-ha!"
771960,772780," In M4."
772780,774080," But macros can be recursive."
774080,780080," There's no limit on the number of recursion levels other than those enforced by your hardware and operating system."
789260,791600," That's a very good way to say that."
791600,793080," I fucking love it."
793080,794140," Ah-ha-ha!"
794140,796780," Ah-ha-ha!"
796780,798240," Based!"
798240,799740," Truly fucking based."
799740,803760," Loops can be programmed using recursion and the conditionals described previously."
803760,812640," There is a built-in macro Shift, which can, among other things, be used for iterating through the actual arguments to a macro."
813580,814860," That is kind of based."
814860,820700," So, Shift, take any number of argument and expand it to all its arguments except arg1."
820700,823740," Holy fucking scheisse, my dear friend."
823740,825980," So, yeah, essentially you have..."
825980,827740," That is fucking cool."
827740,828900," I really like that."
828900,832220," So, an example of this could be use a reverse macro."
832220,833940," Damn."
833940,835200," So, okay."
835200,837260," You do if-else."
837260,839660," Ooh!"
839660,842040," This is so fucking cool."
842880,851480," Have you noticed, my nefronde, that you define the name of the macros with backtick and straight tick?"
851480,853980," Have you noticed that?"
853980,860180," Do you know why it is not just double, like, two backticks or just like this, like that?"
860180,867380," This is to denote the beginning of the quote and the end of the quote."
867820,872720," And as soon as you know the beginning of the quote and the end of the quote, you can do nesting."
872720,874480," We already..."
874480,875500," Fuck!"
875500,878320," Dude, we talked about it in Russian."
878320,881080," In my Russian language stream."
881080,882560," Russian programming language stream."
882560,884400," We didn't talk about it in English."
884400,884840," Damn."
884840,888240," Like, I'm referring to something that majority of my audience doesn't even know."
888760,889040," Right."
889040,890180," But, okay."
890180,896360," So, I did an April Fool stream, which I did entirely in Russian."
896360,901040," And I talked about my programming language, my Russian programming language that I developed."
901040,903840," So, I can actually give you the link about this language."
904640,910540," So, it's called good, I think, good practice language, I think."
910540,911580," I think that's what it's called."
911580,916300," Good practice..."
916300,917380," How is..."
917380,918360," My God."
918360,919140," How do you spell it?"
919140,920420," Good learning language."
920420,921840," Was it good learning language?"
921840,923320," Good training language."
923320,925560," Good training."
925560,925940," Yeah."
926040,927760," So, it's a good training language."
927760,928720," There you go."
928720,933320," So, and the cool thing about this language, it's not a, you know, aha, April Fool's language."
933320,937440," I just replaced some keywords in C++ with defines."
937440,938940," Now, it's a different language."
938940,940000," Ha, ha, ha, ha."
940000,941100," No, it's not that."
941100,942080," Wait, wait, wait."
942080,944460," Like, who the fuck do you think I am?"
944460,948080," Who the fuck do you think I am?"
948080,955600," This is a full-fledged real language developed from ground up, from scratch, without even LLVM."
956040,960300," It's a proper programming language that compiles down to fast assembly."
960300,961060," Right."
961060,964540," And it actually looks like, like this."
964540,965340," Right."
965340,968100," And it's not a pre-processor trick."
968100,974980," It's a real fucking programming language that analyzes this intention and compiles down to x86-64 assembly."
974980,978380," I want to get this clear, as clear as possible."
978380,980380," Because people like to mistreat it."
980380,982480," Oh, it's just an LP Fool's, a bunch of defines."
982480,983560," Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
983560,984340," Fuck you."
984340,985960," Who the fuck do you think I am?"
986000,986820," This is a proper language."
986820,989560," So, anyway, let's put that out of the way."
989560,991960," So, I did the stream about this language."
991960,994280," And it was entirely in Russian for the joke."
994280,1003500," And the interesting thing about this language is that it has very special string literals."
1003500,1003860," Right."
1003860,1006200," It has a very special string literals."
1007000,1014280," And the string literals use the quotes, use not really the English quotes, right, these, like, double quotes."
1014280,1022280," But it uses the French quote, but it uses the French quote, which are like Anglo quotes, linked to a good training language string."
1024080,1024540," Right."
1024540,1028920," So, where was my thingy, my thingy, my jingy, my name for."
1028920,1029340," Right."
1029440,1032100," So, the quote, the quotes are actually like this."
1032100,1032960," Oh, I can't type that."
1032960,1034220," I don't have a compose key."
1034220,1034580," But, yeah."
1034580,1036060," So, they usually look like this."
1036060,1037260," Right."
1037400,1047180," And because the opening quote and closing quote are different, you can actually, you know, nest them."
1047180,1047800," Thank you so much."
1047800,1049360," So, Chad actually gave me the quotes."
1049360,1049560," Yeah."
1049560,1050780," So, this is how they look like."
1050780,1052300," So, this is how they look like."
1052300,1059300," So, that means you can actually have nested quotes and you don't even have to escape them."
1059300,1063180," Like, seriously, you don't even have to escape them."
1063180,1073760," I don't know why this is not a thing in a mainstream programming languages where string literals are defined with quotes that are actually different for the beginning and for the end."
1073760,1082500," Because that enables a very natural nesting of the symbols without requiring any escaping or anything like that."
1082500,1085340," That would be kind of cool."
1085340,1089220," Cosmerica."
1089220,1092240," Well, I mean, here is M4 developed by Americans."
1092240,1095160," And it uses different symbols for the beginning of the end."
1095160,1098480," It has nothing to do with nationality of the authors."
1098480,1101480," It has nothing to do with that."
1101480,1102180," Right."
1102180,1103040," Because here is M4."
1103040,1104440," It does the right thing."
1104440,1105660," It's developed by Americans."
1105660,1108340," Go figure."
1108340,1108960," Am I right?"
1108960,1110840," So, yeah."
1110840,1112220," I think it should be a thing."
1112220,1112720," Right."
1112720,1116420," Even in a modern programming language where, like, strings are actually defined like that."
1116420,1118480," It's just like nobody really thinks about it too much."
1118480,1124100," But, again, and the cool thing is that, the cool thing is that you can nest them."
1124100,1126400," And there you go."
1126400,1129660," You can have nested commands like this."
1129660,1130580," Right."
1130580,1132020," So, you define reverse."
1132020,1138700," And then the body of the reverse also includes some of these, you know, quotes in here."
1138700,1148080," But, again, since beginning and end is different, you can nest them and you don't fall into this backslash escaping hell."
1148080,1150020," Like you usually do in Bash."
1150020,1151860," Right."
1151860,1158300," When you do in, like, when you work with Bash, quite often you are deep down in this escaping hell."
1158300,1159260," Right."
1159260,1164640," Here, because of how you, you know, quote things, you don't fall into that."
1164640,1166300," Isn't that fucking cool?"
1167380,1168800," I think it's freaking cool."
1168800,1170920," So, yeah."
1170920,1172900," We need more, more languages like that, I think."
1172900,1178420," All right."
1178420,1183680," So, here is a reverse macro."
1183680,1184260," Right."
1184260,1186340," So, we have a reverse."
1186340,1191200," And, interestingly, you just have if else."
1191400,1194160," And, I don't understand what the fuck this macro actually does."
1194160,1195840," Why is it defined like that?"
1195840,1196580," This is so bizarre."
1196580,1197240," Wait a second."
1197240,1197900," Okay."
1197900,1200400," So, we accept that."
1200400,1201340," All right."
1201340,1202540," And, if else."
1202540,1206800," All right."
1206800,1208360," That's very interesting."
1209960,1210980," And, then, you just shift."
1210980,1217660," It probably has something to do with the meaning of this stuff."
1217660,1223240," So, the meaning of this stuff is kind of a special."
1223240,1223960," Right."
1223960,1225120," So, you do reverse."
1225120,1228080," We can even try this entire thing."
1228300,1228420," Okay."
1228420,1230260," So, if I try to run this entire thing."
1230260,1230720," Okay."
1230720,1231800," At least it terminates."
1231800,1236140," And, then, I can do reverse full."
1236140,1236820," Right."
1236820,1237860," So, something like this."
1237860,1239140," It just returns full."
1239600,1241340," And, then, we can do bar."
1241340,1242660," Okay."
1242660,1244560," And, it actually reverses all these things."
1244560,1246620," It also included the comma."
1246620,1247120," Look at that."
1247120,1249180," It also included the comma."
1249180,1250600," Which is rather interesting."
1250600,1253980," So, and, this is buzz."
1253980,1255060," Okay."
1255060,1255920," Buzz bar full."
1255920,1257300," Okay."
1257300,1257920," That's pretty cool."
1257920,1260360," So, the thing I have in here."
1260360,1261560," The questions I have in here."
1261560,1263660," Is, what is the hash thing in here?"
1265420,1268180," And, why there is no one argument."
1268180,1269960," Like, in here."
1269960,1271000," Specifically."
1271000,1276320," I guess it treats the commas as least separators."
1276320,1277460," Yeah."
1277460,1278820," Actually, this is a good idea."
1278820,1280420," Like, use something like this."
1280420,1281860," Right."
1281860,1286240," So, I think maybe some languages optionally should support this way of defining string literals."
1286240,1287740," That would be actually kind of cool."
1287740,1288180," I think."
1288180,1292900," So, if the length equal to zero."
1292900,1293680," Okay."
1293680,1295380," So, this is the length of the argument."
1296060,1298280," And, this is comparison to zero, I suppose."
1298280,1300480," So, yeah."
1300480,1304740," I think there was something about if-else somewhere there."
1304740,1305620," Right."
1305620,1306980," So, here is if-else."
1306980,1308940," Oh."
1308940,1310960," String one."
1310960,1311920," String two."
1311920,1313000," Equal."
1313000,1314720," Okay."
1314720,1317200," So, it's basically what happens when it's equal."
1317200,1320380," The other condition, if-else, is which is more powerful."
1320380,1326140," Can be used as a way to introduce a long comment as if-else construct or as multi-branch, blah, blah, blah."
1326140,1328940," Used with only one argument."
1328940,1330660," Simply discards."
1330660,1332260," If-called with three arguments."
1332260,1334020," If-else expand into equal."
1334840,1335200," Okay."
1335200,1340900," So, I suppose it sequentially checks all of these things."
1340900,1341580," Right."
1341580,1343440," So, it checks string one, string two equal."
1343440,1344560," That means equal one."
1344560,1348000," If it's not, it checks a string three, string four."
1348000,1349300," If it's equal, blah, blah, blah."
1349300,1350580," And so on and so forth."
1350580,1351160," Right."
1351200,1352720," That actually makes sense, I think."
1352720,1353840," Right."
1353840,1361140," So, if this thing is, if the amount of arguments for the reverse is equal to zero, you expand to nothing."
1361140,1365380," If it's equal to one, you expand to the first argument."
1365380,1369520," If it's two, you continue recursive call."
1369520,1371940," That is actually, that makes sense."
1371940,1372320," Right."
1372540,1375060," So, we can even try to define something like foo."
1375060,1379100," And in here, we're going to actually expand to the amount of arguments."
1379100,1382560," So, if I call foo, it exp-end of the file string."
1382560,1386320," That is kind of weird, but I mean, okay."
1386320,1387800," Right."
1387800,1389180," Can I do dnl in here?"
1389180,1391540," End of the file string."
1391540,1393760," I didn't actually expect that."
1393760,1395220," So, I suppose this is..."
1395220,1395640," Ah!"
1395640,1396420," Okay."
1396420,1397140," Okay."
1397140,1397360," Okay."
1397360,1398260," Everything's fine."
1398260,1401640," So, maybe what I have to do, I have to do something like this."
1402540,1406040," So, do I have to do something like this?"
1406040,1408120," Why does it work?"
1408120,1410040," Oh, it's awesome."
1410040,1411120," Okay."
1411120,1415120," Who designed compilation errors for this language?"
1415120,1417780," Who designed this language?"
1417780,1420440," Who fucking designed this language, mate?"
1420440,1423520," Get fucking damned."
1423520,1426080," So, Brian Caring..."
1426080,1427240," Oh, oh, oh, oh."
1427240,1430040," Brian..."
1430040,1431440," Oh."
1432540,1436120," The creators of Unix and C."
1436120,1441980," Okay."
1441980,1443200," It's a very good..."
1443200,1445880," The error messages are so fucking great."
1445880,1447180," Like, I really like it."
1447180,1448820," This is a very cool language."
1448820,1452960," Anyways."
1452960,1453960," But yeah."
1453960,1456540," So, it would be actually better to have, like..."
1456540,1458540," You know, more..."
1458540,1460020," Descriptive error messages."
1460160,1461180," But I mean..."
1461180,1463200," Like, right now, it is developed by GNU."
1463200,1465620," And I don't think you can expect that from them."
1465620,1466340," But anyway."
1466340,1467980," So, let's try to go like this."
1467980,1469440," Oh!"
1472080,1475420," This is considered to be one argument."
1475420,1477540," But if you..."
1477540,1487060," What if I provide something like this?"
1487060,1489000," It is still one."
1489000,1491200," No argument is still one."
1491200,1496260," But if I provide something like this, it is two."
1498560,1499120," Fascinating."
1499120,1500360," I'm not gonna lie."
1500360,1502600," So, can we just say..."
1502600,1502740," Okay."
1502740,1504600," Replace it with your first argument."
1504600,1507640," Right."
1507640,1510140," We don't have any..."
1510140,1510680," Oh, well, I mean..."
1510680,1512900," We have to actually say something like..."
1512900,1513380," Well, no."
1513380,1516020," You have to..."
1516020,1518420," Aha."
1520420,1521120," All right."
1521120,1521780," Very interesting."
1521780,1522980," So, this is gonna be full."
1522980,1526060," And if I just call it like that..."
1526060,1528560," If I just call it like that..."
1528560,1535440," But it's still considered to be one argument, whether you want it or not."
1535440,1537620," But that argument is empty."
1539440,1540480," Oh, my God."
1540480,1544920," So, it is going to give me more..."
1544920,1546580," Oh, my God."
1546580,1548760," It is an empty argument."
1548760,1554880," Okay."
1554880,1557460," So, it's that kind of language."
1559960,1560960," Oof."
1560960,1568140," Beats."
1568140,1571780," Okay."
1571780,1573000," Okay."
1573000,1575100," String interpolation."
1575100,1576180," Not oof."
1576180,1576600," Foo."
1576600,1577280," Yeah."
1577280,1578180," Sorry."
1578180,1583980," But at least now I kind of understand what the fuck is going on here, which is cool, I suppose."
1584340,1588520," So, I understand how this reverse macro works, which is nice."
1588520,1591140," And I also want to sneeze just super quick."
1591140,1592220," Just a second."
1592220,1594480," Pause alarm."
1594480,1596000," Gebait."
1596000,1597240," I gebaited you all."
1597240,1597940," I'm not gonna sneeze."
1597940,1599420," Okay."
1599420,1601520," What are the interesting things we can do in here?"
1601520,1602520," I wonder..."
1602520,1607220," Can you have like a steady loop?"
1607220,1614060," Can you have a steady loop which just doesn't overflow?"
1614340,1614860," Or anything?"
1614860,1617960," That would have been kind of interesting."
1617960,1621900," So, tail recursive in some sense."
1621900,1623780," While true."
1623780,1626000," Well, I mean, there is no while loops in here."
1626000,1627900," There is no loops in this language."
1627900,1628360," Right."
1628360,1629980," So, let me see."
1629980,1633040," So, tail recursive."
1633040,1633900," Tail call."
1633900,1635360," Maybe tail call."
1635360,1636000," Okay."
1636000,1638780," There is no tail call optimizations or anything like that."
1638780,1641760," So, okay."
1643060,1644340," So, we need to..."
1644340,1646200," Like, I kind of understand the idea of this language."
1646200,1646540," Right."
1646540,1656080," So, the thing we need to do now, probably, we need to introduce a ray leap into this language."
1656080,1656600," Somehow."
1656600,1657800," Right."
1657800,1658900," We can call..."
1658900,1666960," We can basically imagine that all of these macros, they are basically function calls."
1667660,1674220," Can we take the source code of M4 and add more built-in macros like that?"
1674220,1675840," More of them."
1675840,1679760," So, and essentially introduce shit like init window."
1679760,1681300," Right."
1681300,1685340," And in here, we would say something like 800 by 600."
1685340,1688880," And here, we're going to have something like hello from M4."
1688880,1689440," Right."
1689500,1690900," So, this is going to be the first thing."
1690900,1692180," Right."
1692180,1696020," So, and then we can introduce some sort of a loop."
1696020,1696700," Right."
1696700,1699760," So, we can do a loop within the loop."
1699760,1701780," Let me comment out this entire thing."
1701780,1702200," Right."
1702200,1703420," So, this is going to be dnl."
1703420,1707840," Define loop."
1708920,1713880," So, and essentially in here, we're going to do something like this."
1713880,1719440," If else, window should close."
1719440,1724980," Window should close is 1."
1724980,1728760," By the way, I have to be really careful with this thing."
1728760,1735240," Is there something to prevent me from making a mistake with this code?"
1735240,1736360," That would be actually kind of cool."
1736980,1742220," But anyway, so, if this thing should not close, right."
1742220,1748820," If this thing should not close, we probably have to expand it to more calls."
1748820,1749580," Right."
1749580,1753420," Specifically, something like begin drawing."
1753420,1753880," Right."
1753880,1756400," So, begin drawing and end drawing."
1756400,1758980," And that's about it."
1758980,1759760," Right."
1759760,1763500," And after that, we should just call loop."
1763500,1765440," Yeah."
1765440,1766060," Makes sense."
1766980,1768800," So, something like that."
1768800,1770720," Maybe we can even do something like this."
1770720,1772220," Like, window should close."
1772220,1773040," Right."
1773040,1779740," So, essentially, modify the source code of M4 and make all of these things like built-in macros."
1779740,1780920," Built-in things."
1780920,1783640," Yeah."
1783640,1784820," That sounds interesting, actually."
1784820,1785580," Yeah."
1786720,1788240," So, maybe we should give it a try."
1788240,1790540," Want that easily overflow?"
1790540,1791200," It may."
1791200,1792840," It may actually easily overflow."
1792840,1796140," And this is why I was specifically looking for tail call optimization."
1796140,1796580," Right."
1796580,1798960," And I couldn't find any information."
1798960,1803480," So, that means we'll have to overflow in this specific case."
1803700,1805680," But, I mean, hey, it doesn't have any limitations."
1805680,1806100," Right."
1806100,1814200," So, it allows you to just do that as long as your hardware and software actually, you know, supports that."
1814200,1816740," You should add external command."
1816740,1817780," It's too much work."
1817880,1821260," It's just easier to simply hard-code these things in the source code."
1821260,1822880," Right."
1822880,1825160," So, it's just like it's easier to hard-code this entire stuff."
1825160,1829400," So, in here, we can do something like close window like this."
1829400,1830880," Maybe we don't even have to do it like that."
1830880,1832100," All right."
1832100,1839820," So, let's actually find the source code for this entire stuff and see if we can even build that or modify that or anything."
1839820,1842020," So, GNU M4."
1842020,1842660," Right."
1842660,1845240," So, where is the official website for GNU M4?"
1845240,1847540," So, here is the GNU M4 website."
1848640,1849160," Right."
1849160,1850460," Downloading M4."
1850460,1853380," So, we have that."
1853380,1858540," The latest tablet version is 1.4.19 and can be found at FTP."
1858540,1865360," It's kind of interesting how all of the FTP servers these days provide HTTP protocol and it's not actually FTP protocol."
1865360,1866580," Right."
1866580,1870380," Does anybody actually use FTP protocol on the internet?"
1870380,1872420," Right."
1872420,1873660," I don't think anybody used that."
1873660,1876040," Like, it's just HTTP replaced it completely."
1876560,1881360," So, let me copy the source code of this entire thing and we're going to try to build it actually."
1881360,1883320," Okay."
1883320,1886080," So, I'm going to do just WGET."
1886080,1888740," WGET and C."
1892320,1893660," So, boom."
1893660,1896620," I don't have an XZ."
1896620,1898280," Really?"
1898280,1900180," That's actually kind of interesting."
1900180,1903620," XBPS query."
1903620,1906240," RS on XZ."
1906240,1907140," Is that a thing?"
1907140,1908220," XZ?"
1908220,1909980," Yeah."
1909980,1910620," So, okay."
1910620,1913220," XBPS install XZ."
1913220,1914640," Let's actually go ahead and install."
1916360,1917060," All right."
1917060,1919020," So, maybe now we should be able to..."
1919020,1919300," There we go."
1919300,1920540," We actually unpacked it."
1920540,1922540," Do we have configure?"
1922540,1923400," Okay."
1923400,1924760," So, here's the configure script."
1924760,1927460," Let's just go ahead and run it."
1927460,1929480," Hoping that it will do something."
1929480,1932740," That's a lot of checks, actually, for just a simple text transformer."
1934740,1935420," But, yeah."
1935420,1937540," A lot of yeses."
1937540,1938940," Some noes."
1938940,1941200," But I don't think they are too critical."
1941200,1942100," Right."
1942100,1943020," So, majority..."
1943020,1945740," Oh, it even checks individual POSIX functions."
1945740,1950180," It just, like, literally checks how it is POSIX compliant."
1950180,1951800," My environment, specifically."
1951800,1953460," Okay."
1953460,1956420," So, can I build this entire thing with five threads?"
1956420,1959780," It's a five threads building of M4."
1959780,1962060," And we managed to build that."
1962480,1966440," Do we have a file that is executable?"
1966440,1967920," Here we go."
1967920,1969640," Here is an executable file."
1969640,1972000," And it does the thing."
1972000,1975300," So, I can probably run things with that file."
1975300,1975560," Okay."
1975560,1977360," So, we managed to produce an executable."
1977360,1978040," That's pretty cool."
1978040,1981860," One thing we want to find."
1981860,1986040," We want to find a place where we define all of these..."
1986040,1989240," All of the new commands and stuff like that."
1989240,1989480," Right."
1989480,1991080," So, I'm interested in that specific place."
1991200,1995820," Let's make grep, for instance, for string literal."
1995820,1996400," Right."
1996400,1996800," Okay."
1996800,1998060," So, here is an interesting thing."
1998060,2000980," If else is a name that kind of stands out."
2000980,2003060," It's probably going to stand out within the source code."
2003060,2007980," And there's probably string literal that is literally if else somewhere."
2007980,2008480," Right."
2008540,2014180," So, because as you parse a language, they probably have like a switch case or maybe some sort of a table."
2014180,2019380," And in that table, in that table, you have all of these names and stuff like that."
2019380,2020340," So, let's actually grab it."
2020340,2021300," And here it is."
2021300,2022220," We instantly found it."
2022220,2022400," Okay."
2022400,2022880," So, that's cool."
2022880,2025200," So, this is where..."
2025200,2025880," That is..."
2025880,2026020," Okay."
2026020,2030420," So, that's very easy to actually extend."
2032040,2039600," So, let's go ahead and maybe not add, but let's actually see how this entire stuff is implemented."
2039600,2040440," So, there is a..."
2040440,2048100," This is a kind of cool place to learn about all of the commands of M4 instead of reading that stinky manual."
2048100,2049200," Honestly."
2049200,2051080," That's kind of cool."
2051080,2052180," So, you have a val."
2052180,2054400," So, okay."
2054400,2056140," What is M4 eval?"
2056140,2057160," Here it is."
2057160,2057440," Okay."
2057440,2059560," So, you have ob stat."
2059560,2060220," Okay."
2060220,2060800," OBS."
2060800,2063440," Then you have a bunch of..."
2063440,2066740," Why is this so fucking straightforward?"
2066740,2067680," Can anybody tell me?"
2068900,2070660," And this is a GNU software."
2070660,2073900," Why is it just..."
2073900,2075000," All right."
2075000,2076720," So, and..."
2076720,2077540," Yeah, that's pretty cool."
2077540,2082340," So, this section contains the top-level code for the eval built-in."
2082340,2086000," The actual work is done in the function evaluate, which lives in eval C."
2086000,2086680," Right."
2086680,2088540," So, that means this thing does evaluate."
2088540,2089940," Yeah."
2089940,2097360," So, it's a classical scripting language situation where on the edge, on the border"
2097360,2103580," between the scripting language world and actual native runtime world, you have to do a little"
2103580,2107940," bit of a preparation, a little bit of a bureaucracy before actually doing any job."
2107940,2108220," Right."
2108220,2111100," So, because you need to pass arguments, you need to prepare things and stuff like that."
2111100,2113000," It's a freaking classical situation."
2113520,2115140," Kind of like a..."
2115140,2121680," Like I recently was working a lot with WebAssembly because I'm currently rewriting my game from"
2121680,2123060," TypeScript to C3."
2123060,2123520," Right."
2123520,2130460," So, and because of that, like I'm moving a lot of code from TypeScript to C3 to WebAssembly."
2130740,2135900," And I got to tell you, there is like a lot of friction on the border between the JavaScript"
2135900,2138360," world and WebAssembly."
2138360,2141000," What is this control L?"
2141000,2143700," It's a sign for the new page."
2143700,2148660," If you try to print it on the printer, when the printer encounters this thing, it will start"
2148660,2149200," a new page."
2149200,2151020," That's what it is actually."
2151020,2151920," It's a new page."
2153460,2154120," So, yeah."
2154120,2161100," So, I suppose like maybe it's also when you try to display like with, I don't know, when"
2161100,2163620," you convert it to PDF, it's also going to go on the next page."
2163620,2166640," RMS likes to control L things."
2166640,2167380," Maybe."
2167380,2168620," All right."
2168620,2170120," I didn't really see that."
2170120,2170400," Yeah."
2170400,2176320," So, oh, they split it sections of code into interesting."
2176320,2178240," Oh, that's actually super cool."
2178240,2179880," Excuse me."
2179880,2183420," And they have a little bit of documentation in here."
2183460,2185520," It's kind of funny."
2185520,2187220," That is actually kind of funny."
2187220,2188380," Okay."
2188380,2191260," So, definitely."
2191260,2192720," So, yeah."
2192720,2197340," And I was moving some code from TypeScript to WebAssembly."
2197340,2200580," And there's a lot of friction between these two worlds."
2200580,2207160," This is because they kind of have fundamentally different memory models even, right?"
2207160,2215120," So, because you have JavaScript objects and you can't easily pass a JavaScript object into WebAssembly."
2215120,2218820," You need to do some serialization and, you know, stuff like that."
2218820,2220120," And it's just like, it's very annoying."
2221120,2227320," And it's kind of like, it could be solved with additional frameworks."
2227320,2234080," But why was it designed so poorly in the first place that you need additional frameworks to fix it up?"
2234080,2236380," This is the thing about freaking web standards."
2236560,2238920," I swear to God, they do this shit intentionally."
2238920,2246860," Every time they introduce a new thing in the WebStandard, they make it, they always make it half-assed."
2246860,2252360," So, you have to develop a framework on top of it to fix it."
2253420,2257780," It's almost like these motherfuckers are colluding with the creators of frameworks."
2257780,2261320," So, then they create these additional jobs."
2261320,2263960," They can never fucking just solve the problem."
2263960,2267060," No, they're going to make a half-assed mechanism."
2267060,2270800," So, you have to create some sort of a fucking framework."
2270800,2272140," Like, why the fuck they do that?"
2272140,2275540," This literally feels like they're colluding with people who are going to be developing this framework."
2275540,2277500," Or maybe they are the same people."
2278160,2282300," Right, maybe this is the same people who are just, like, creating the standards."
2282300,2286180," But then they go to open source projects and developing these frameworks."
2286180,2287780," Maybe it's literally the same people."
2287780,2288780," I have no fucking idea."
2288780,2290140," Somebody need to investigate that."
2290140,2292880," But it's fucking sus, I'm telling you."
2292880,2294120," It's fucking sus."
2294120,2296880," Big React hold a lot of influence."
2296880,2297480," Yeah, exactly."
2297480,2305660," Excuse me."
2306040,2308720," So, let's try to introduce something in here."
2308720,2312540," I'm interested what is built-in."
2312540,2313400," All right."
2313400,2314060," So, can I jump?"
2314060,2316260," I can't even fucking jump there, mate."
2316260,2318080," Can't fucking even jump there."
2318080,2318380," Can I?"
2318380,2319600," Do I have e-tag?"
2319600,2321680," So, e-tag."
2321680,2323060," I do have e-tags."
2323060,2332340," So, let's find files in SRC with the name that is either C or H."
2332340,2333560," Can we find all these motherfuckers?"
2333560,2334120," We can't."
2334120,2335140," There's not that many of them."
2335680,2338320," Actually, this is a rather small thing."
2338320,2340880," If I cut this entire thing."
2340880,2342540," So, here is the entirety of the source code."
2342540,2345160," And how many lines of C code we have?"
2345160,2350520," Eight, almost 9,000 lines of code for just a text transformer."
2350520,2351100," But, I mean."
2351100,2353800," So, yeah."
2353800,2355740," I mean, I guess it's reasonable."
2355920,2356920," It's also very old."
2356920,2367500," So, it probably has a lot of like historical craft and to, you know, maintain some weirdness and quirks of original versions of M4 or something like that."
2367500,2368800," So, that's kind of understandable for this thing."
2368800,2369820," So, that's kind of understandable for this thing to be picked."
2369820,2371520," That is kind of understandable."
2371820,2372720," So, anyway."
2372720,2378100," What I was trying to do, I was trying to just obtain the list of those things and I just want to feed them into etags."
2378100,2378860," Right."
2378920,2380420," So, I have a tags file."
2380420,2382400," Here's the tags file."
2382400,2384180," So, then I can do some stuff."
2384180,2385560," So, here's the built-ins."
2385560,2387820," And I want to be able to do the following thing."
2387820,2390880," Essentially, jump to the definition of built-in."
2391360,2392880," And it has a name, right?"
2392880,2393980," So, in some build fields."
2393980,2399680," So, whether it's a GNU extension, Grok's macro args, and blind if no arguments."
2399680,2405960," And then it pointed to the built-in function, which is function that accepts op stack."
2405960,2407880," I have no idea what the fuck is that."
2407880,2414580," But, I suppose it's some sort of like maybe context where maybe it's literally stack, the call stack of the whole thing."
2414580,2419740," Then the amount of arguments you have and the arguments themselves, which are talking data."
2419880,2421380," Okay, so, that's actually really reasonable."
2421380,2425800," So, yeah, I don't know."
2425800,2427700," So, some of these things are GNU extensions."
2427700,2428720," Some of them are not."
2428720,2433140," I suppose we're going to assume that they're all false."
2433140,2433780," Right."
2433780,2436560," So, because the standard thing in here, they're all false."
2436560,2437820," Okay."
2437820,2442420," So, let's go ahead and try to maybe introduce your mom."
2442420,2443340," Right."
2443340,2446700," So, this is going to be M4, your mom."
2447980,2450360," So, M4, DNL."
2450360,2453060," I'm going to literally grab this entire thing."
2453060,2461560," I'm not going to follow this nice convention of like defining new pages and having these sort of boxes in there."
2461560,2462420," Maybe I could."
2462420,2462760," Okay."
2462760,2463200," Okay."
2463200,2463520," Okay."
2463520,2463740," Listen."
2463740,2464520," Maybe I could."
2465600,2471120," So, we can just copy paste this entire new page in here and I can take this entire thing in here."
2471120,2472460," Right."
2472820,2485300," So, we can say built-in M4 macro designed specifically for your mom."
2485300,2485920," Right."
2485920,2487200," So, it's actually a line."
2487200,2488420," This entire thing."
2488420,2489560," So, it's a macro."
2489560,2491880," It's specifically designed for your mom."
2491880,2493940," M4."
2493940,2501600," So, it's a built-in attribute M4 DNL."
2501600,2501960," Right."
2501960,2503660," So, let's go back."
2503660,2505640," Let's put it in here."
2505760,2507300," So, this is your mom."
2507300,2508900," Maybe."
2508900,2509640," Ooh."
2509640,2510660," Look at that."
2510660,2512740," What is this macro?"
2512740,2513660," Maybe used."
2513660,2515500," That's really funny."
2515500,2516320," Yeah."
2516320,2516940," Okay."
2517000,2521120," So, it's maybe to sort of like suppress warnings or something like that."
2521120,2522540," All right."
2522540,2527440," So, at DNL, I'm looking for..."
2527440,2528440," I don't even know."
2528440,2531140," How can I issue some stuff?"
2531140,2537540," One of the things I can do, I can essentially just print something."
2537540,2540980," Your mom is a nice lady."
2540980,2543160," Something like that."
2543680,2548040," But I also want to actually embed that thing into the stream output."
2548040,2550100," You know what I'm talking about?"
2550100,2550660," Right."
2550660,2552620," I don't really know how to do that yet."
2552620,2554400," I don't really know how to do that yet."
2554400,2555300," But I'm going to try."
2555300,2556900," All right."
2556900,2559840," So, can I just rebuild this entire thing and see if it's going to work?"
2559840,2560060," Okay."
2560060,2561380," So, M4."
2561380,2564380," No, I'm declared here, but not a function."
2564380,2565960," Huh."
2565960,2567900," But I..."
2567900,2570680," Oh, I never forward declared this entire thing."
2570680,2572060," Is it for..."
2572060,2573100," Okay."
2573680,2577700," And they have a special macro to forward declare this entire stuff?"
2577700,2579100," And it's..."
2579100,2580960," Why do you need a macro for that?"
2580960,2584740," Okay."
2584740,2585760," I mean, fine."
2585760,2588020," But this is kind of a weird macro."
2588020,2591460," So..."
2591460,2593060," Okay."
2593060,2593420," Sure."
2594800,2595520," All right."
2595520,2599120," So, we introduced a new built-in into M4."
2599120,2601060," That was actually kind of easy."
2601060,2608140," Honestly, this could be a very cool interview question similar to memcached interview question."
2608140,2612460," Introduce a new built-in into M4."
2613200,2613700," All right."
2613700,2618520," So, just to test how quickly you can navigate the foreign code base."
2618520,2618780," Right."
2618780,2620580," So, the code base you've never seen before."
2620580,2623480," And how quickly you can extend it and stuff like that."
2623480,2624680," I think it's pretty good."
2628720,2631280," So, let's go ahead and maybe tense this kind of stuff."
2631280,2633340," So, I'm going to create your mom M4."
2633340,2634780," All right."
2634780,2637200," So, and I'm going to just like do your mom."
2637200,2638800," I'm going to call your mom."
2638800,2640480," Calling your mom, by the way."
2640480,2641820," Calling your mom."
2641820,2643220," Calling, calling your mom."
2643220,2645340," Your mom is a nice lady."
2645340,2646700," There you go."
2647120,2653580," We extended GNU M4 and added your mom built-in function first."
2653580,2659680," Isn't that fucking poggers, my lady?"
2659680,2662080," That is freaking fucking poggers."
2662080,2664180," So, yeah."
2664180,2667000," I'm qualified to actually maintain M4, I suppose."
2667000,2668680," Because it's relatively easy."
2668680,2669440," It's very straightforward."
2669440,2671220," But I'm kind of curious."
2671220,2676880," How do you like actually like issue tokens, right?"
2676880,2679100," Because it just printed it to the standard output."
2679100,2680940," But is that sufficient even?"
2680940,2682240," Like I don't freaking know."
2682240,2686260," So, is there any functions that can do some things?"
2686260,2689300," Oh, incur."
2689300,2691780," Inker, incur, incur."
2691780,2693240," What the fuck is the incur function?"
2693240,2694660," So, does it increment the value?"
2694660,2696520," Right."
2696520,2700280," Oh, you can have numeric arguments."
2700280,2703580," Wait a freaking second."
2703580,2706560," You can have numeric arguments."
2706640,2709300," So, that means I can do something like..."
2709300,2710340," Okay."
2710340,2711640," Can I do inc..."
2711640,2712500," Incurs?"
2712500,2712940," Okay."
2712940,2714780," So, it even highlights that 68."
2714780,2717560," And if I try to do..."
2717560,2718040," Okay."
2718040,2719640," That is very freaking nice."
2719640,2720240," So, you..."
2720240,2722060," You can have counters."
2722060,2724140," Bravo."
2724140,2728300," You can have counters in this shit."
2728300,2731300," Is M4 Turing complete?"
2731300,2731720," Yes."
2731860,2733720," As far as now, it is in fact Turing complete."
2733720,2737860," Then we can have for loops."
2737860,2740060," We can have loops with counters."
2740060,2741600," That's what we can have."
2743860,2747560," So, let me see what else can we do."
2747560,2748100," So, okay."
2748100,2750500," So, we increment ship out."
2750500,2753620," Oh, ship out."
2753620,2755520," Ship out."
2755520,2757240," It's funny."
2760240,2765040," So, I suppose this thing ships out the token or something like that."
2765040,2766440," Shit out."
2766440,2767440," Wait."
2767440,2770120," Why isn't it called shut out?"
2770120,2773100," Obstack."
2773100,2777480," Oh, Obstack is probably like where you put things."
2777480,2779440," Damn, brother."
2780320,2780540," Okay."
2780540,2782320," So, you shut out..."
2782320,2785600," Objects."
2785600,2785860," Okay."
2785860,2787080," So, it's an object stack."
2787080,2787440," I see."
2787440,2787680," I see."
2787680,2787940," I see."
2787940,2791240," Shit out."
2791240,2796680," Shit out an integer."
2796680,2797940," So, and it's actually pretty straightforward."
2797940,2799480," You just do N to A."
2799480,2804060," But where does it allocate that?"
2804060,2805260," What the fuck is N to A?"
2805260,2805520," Okay."
2805520,2806680," So, it's a local one."
2806680,2809520," No fucking way."
2809940,2814280," Don't freaking tell me you return S to R."
2814280,2815900," No, it doesn't return."
2815900,2817120," But what is S?"
2817120,2818280," Bro."
2818280,2821340," Oh, it's..."
2821340,2823000," It's static."
2823000,2823920," Holy fucking shit."
2823920,2826280," Like, I almost had a heart attack, brother."
2826280,2827880," I almost had a heart attack."
2827880,2830500," I thought they allocated some shit on the stack."
2830500,2832480," And then returned it."
2832480,2834040," The pointer to the stack."
2834040,2836020," And it's like, I didn't notice the static keyword."
2836020,2838240," Okay."
2839560,2842300," Rust, by the way, would have not allowed that."
2842300,2844840," Rust would have not allowed that."
2844840,2846300," But I mean, anyways."
2846300,2848600," Shit out."
2848600,2850600," So, that's how you actually do that."
2850600,2852240," So, we can do OBS grow."
2852240,2853700," Obstack grow."
2853700,2856800," And I can't really find the definition of this entire thing."
2856800,2860980," But I suppose it's just like you provide the pointer to the buffer that you want to grow."
2861520,2863300," And then the rest of the stuff."
2863300,2868580," So, because of that, by the way, we can use Obstack grow for your mom."
2869780,2872200," So, M4, your mom."
2872200,2874060," So, here it is."
2874060,2876100," And that's how we can do that."
2876100,2878200," So, message."
2878200,2880340," Did we F'd?"
2882340,2883780," Oh, shit, bruv."
2883780,2884960," Look, look, look."
2884960,2889140," We lost 359 frames."
2889140,2890740," I really apologize for that."
2890740,2892420," I think KGB is on to me."
2892420,2893260," Right."
2893260,2894740," So, yeah."
2894740,2897760," This is because I found their backdoor in M4."
2898900,2904160," So, we found the shutout function."
2904160,2907240," And so, where you usually shut out?"
2907240,2908860," Out of the backdoor."
2908860,2909580," Ha-ha."
2909580,2912940," So, and KGB tried to actually cancel me after finding their backdoor."
2912940,2913960," So, anyway."
2913960,2915100," So, what we need to do."
2915100,2917600," We need to take the your mom message."
2917600,2918360," Right."
2918360,2920760," And we need to put it into a separate variable."
2920760,2923720," So, then we can actually shut it out."
2923720,2925500," So, we're shutting out the string."
2925500,2928880," Is there something like there should be a function to shut out?"
2928900,2931180," Uh, the sister."
2931180,2934140," Ship."
2934140,2936460," Ship out."
2936460,2938160," Where is the ship out?"
2938160,2938560," Yeah."
2938560,2938800," Okay."
2938800,2941420," So, so we just accept these kind of things."
2941420,2941740," Right."
2941740,2943960," So, uh-huh."
2943960,2948140," And just shut out sister static void."
2948140,2949500," Uh-huh."
2949500,2953460," And here we're going to accept the sister."
2953460,2955900," Const char sister."
2955900,2958880," I'm pretty sure there was already something like that."
2958900,2961000," but I'm fucking no man."
2961000,2961860," I'm fucking no."
2961860,2963400," So, this is the sister."
2963400,2965160," Uh, wait a second."
2965160,2966640," We lost the your mom message."
2966640,2968260," Let's bring it back in here."
2968260,2971380," So, sister and sister."
2971380,2973000," Uh-huh."
2973480,2978640," And then we can just, uh, OBS tag."
2978640,2984560," Um, shut out sister OBS like this."
2984560,2986420," We don't even have to provide a new line, I think."
2986420,2988780," We don't even have to do that."
2988780,2990320," All right."
2990320,2992360," So, we're shutting out your mom."
2992360,2993860," So, sorry."
2993860,2996120," Uh, right."
2996220,2998320," So, and now, if I try to do something like this,"
2998320,2999580," it actually shaded it out."
2999580,3001020," It actually shaded it out."
3001020,3003040," So, that's very, very freaking nice."
3003040,3007040," We will need to know how to do that, actually."
3007040,3007500," Right."
3007500,3011220," So, maybe not."
3011220,3011480," Right."
3011500,3013360," So, because we're going to be calling to Raylib anyway."
3013360,3015460," So, it doesn't really matter that much."
3015460,3016100," Right."
3016100,3018300," Uh, your mom's sister."
3018300,3025340," Cool."
3025340,3026500," Cool, cool, cool."
3026500,3031200," So, this is, all of that is actually easy-peasy lemon fucking squeezy, mate."
3031200,3034700," We need to link with Raylib, brother."
3034700,3036140," Brother."
3036140,3037340," Brother."
3037340,3038400," I'm telling you, brother."
3038400,3040360," We need to link with Raylib."
3041240,3042380," And you know what that means?"
3042380,3050020," We have to modify this clusterfuck of autoconf scripts that I never touched in my entire life."
3050020,3052000," I have no, I never worked with autoconf."
3052000,3054820," I, like, I'm telling you, brother."
3054820,3056460," I never worked with autoconf."
3056460,3059440," The only thing I did is configure, make, make, install, like, everyone else."
3059440,3062240," I don't know how to create my own things."
3062240,3067200," So, I think I'm, I might die in the process, actually."
3067200,3069280," I think I might die in the process."
3069280,3071060," So, I have no idea how to do this kind of shit."
3071060,3074000," So, we'll see, we'll see."
3074000,3076120," So, somebody gifting me subs."
3076120,3076560," Thank you."
3076560,3077680," Thank you for encouraging me."
3077680,3079200," By the way, let's actually take a look at the subs."
3079200,3081500," So, that's a lot of subs."
3081500,3083900," Pinedow, I think I already acknowledged you."
3083900,3085700," Yilon Fass."
3085700,3087960," Thank you so much for Twitch Prime."
3087960,3088520," Nemen."
3088520,3090320," Thank you so much for Tier 1."
3090320,3090860," Valini."
3090860,3092200," Thank you so much for Tier 1 with the message."
3092200,3093220," Sodium Smug."
3093220,3094260," Sodium Smug indeed."
3096260,3096740," God."
3096740,3098660," I hope we are pronouncing your name correctly."
3098660,3100960," Thank you so much for five gifted subs."
3100960,3102640," Five gifted subs."
3102640,3105240," C flag and LD flag."
3105240,3107360," That's actually not a bad idea, honestly."
3107360,3108100," Right."
3108100,3109960," So, because they probably use that shit."
3109960,3111380," So, yeah."
3111380,3111780," Let's see."
3112700,3113100," Anyways."
3113100,3117360," So, let me maybe find Raylib."
3117360,3121960," Let's go to RaySan5 Raylib."
3121960,3125920," Where are the releases?"
3125920,3128120," I'm going to grab the releases."
3128120,3129660," 22 releases."
3135660,3141140," So, let's copy this diz link and wget."
3141140,3142820," Let's go."
3142820,3146580," Okay."
3146580,3148440," We downloaded Raylib."
3148440,3151960," I think I downloaded it in a wrong place, honestly."
3151960,3154560," I think I should probably put it somewhere here."
3154560,3156620," Like so."
3156620,3157300," Okay."
3157300,3158920," Let's unpack this Bech."
3158920,3163280," So, the Bech has been unpacked successfully."
3163800,3165880," In the build-ins, what we want to do."
3165880,3169440," We want to include Raylib."
3169440,3172700," So, maybe I'm going to do something like Raylib."
3172700,3175400," And if I just try to build this entire shit."
3175400,3177060," It's probably not going to build."
3177060,3177400," Yeah."
3177400,3178340," It can't find."
3178340,3179700," Like, bro."
3179700,3180960," In 2024."
3180960,3184780," Why Raylib is not part of the POSIX standards in 2024?"
3184780,3191380," Honestly, Raylib should just become a part of the POSIX standards at this point."
3191380,3191640," Right."
3191640,3192540," I mean, it's just like."
3193560,3194260," Why not?"
3194260,3195780," Yeah."
3195780,3197940," Let's make it a part of the POSIX standards, bro."
3197940,3198920," Okay."
3198920,3201540," Somebody suggested to just like do C flags."
3201540,3204560," Can I just do, you know, I."
3204560,3206800," Raylib."
3206800,3209780," I didn't have all the completion of this shitty editor."
3209780,3211360," For fuck's sake, mate."
3211360,3214200," This editor is a piece of scheisse."
3214200,3218800," This straight up piece of fucking scheisse, mate."
3219400,3220980," All right."
3220980,3221240," All right."
3221240,3224160," So, let me actually grab this entire thing."
3224160,3225880," And this is include."
3225880,3226280," Okay."
3226280,3227180," So, we'll get that."
3227180,3232380," So, and if I go to here and just put it in here."
3232380,3233460," Will it be."
3233660,3234780," No, it didn't work."
3234780,3239520," C flags didn't fix scheisse."
3239520,3243720," It didn't fix scheisse whatsoever."
3243720,3246040," So, it can't find them, unfortunately."
3246880,3251280," I wonder if this is because, like, it's looking that from the wrong director."
3251280,3252940," Maybe I have to put a dot in here."
3252940,3255260," No, that didn't help me."
3255260,3257860," You need to see flags on config."
3258500,3260720," That's a good idea, actually."
3260720,3262440," Let's take a look at the configurer."
3262440,3263740," Configurer help."
3263740,3264680," Okay."
3264680,3265960," So, do we have."
3265960,3267360," Ooh."
3267360,3270400," Some influential environment variables."
3270400,3275300," It's a very funny way to put it, actually."
3275300,3276900," It's a really funny way to put it."
3276900,3277120," Okay."
3277120,3279760," So, let's try to do this thing."
3279760,3280820," I'm going to reconfigure it."
3280820,3282080," Let's go."
3282080,3283840," Oh, it's going to take some time."
3283840,3286780," Does it even mention sea flags anywhere?"
3286780,3288780," I don't see it mention the sea flags."
3288780,3289520," So, whatever."
3289520,3306260," Sea flags."
3306260,3307440," Flags."
3307440,3308840," No, it doesn't even mention them."
3308840,3310280," It doesn't even mention them."
3310280,3313540," So, let's go ahead and try to rebuild this entire thing."
3314700,3316960," I should have actually done that with several threads."
3316960,3319460," I don't know why I picked one single thread, but I mean."
3319460,3326100," It actually worked."
3326100,3329040," Thank you, random chatter in the chat."
3329040,3330840," I really appreciate you."
3330840,3331820," You were right."
3331820,3333940," You could just like, yeah, we can just do it like that."
3333940,3337580," But we don't really use any RayLip."
3337580,3340260," So, because of that, it kind of just worked."
3340260,3342120," So, it's kind of strange."
3342120,3344760," But anyway, let's go into the build-ins."
3344760,3349780," And let's find the place where we can extend things."
3350620,3356400," So, here we need to introduce init window, right?"
3356400,3360060," And let's say this is going to be m4 init window."
3360060,3364820," So, in here, I feel like I'm going to create another page."
3365820,3375120," So, built-ins, built-in bindings, bindings for RayLip."
3375120,3382720," So, maybe I can actually simplify this entire thing like so."
3384600,3387460," So, and then we take that, right?"
3387460,3389600," So, then we take that, we put it in here."
3389600,3392020," So, this is going to be init window."
3392020,3402000," And in here, we're going to just call init window, 800-600, hello from m4, like this."
3402000,3404320," So, that's literally what we're going to be doing."
3404320,3406560," That's literally what we're going to be doing."
3406560,3410860," So, let's try to maybe build this entire thing."
3410860,3412480," One more time."
3413600,3416300," So, yeah, we need to declare it first, right?"
3416300,3419540," So, we have to use this shitty macro, declare."
3419540,3422060," You know what?"
3422060,3424800," I'm actually not going to put a space in here."
3424800,3427500," Yeah, I'm not going to put space."
3427500,3430820," Like, there will be a space everywhere in all of the, except this one."
3430820,3433040," Fuck this one in particular."
3433040,3434420," Fuck this one in particular."
3434420,3435380," I'm not going to add space in here."
3435380,3436420," All right."
3436420,3437240," So, that's very cool."
3437240,3440080," Now, it fails with the linkage."
3440080,3442820," Now, it fails with the linkage."
3442820,3448620," Which means that we have to reconfigure this entire shit yet again, but with the other way."
3448620,3449660," What was the other variable?"
3449660,3450340," Does anybody remember?"
3450340,3452520," Is it ldflags or something?"
3452520,3455320," I think it was ldflags."
3455320,3456620," Does anybody remember?"
3456620,3457120," I forgot."
3457120,3457800," Chat."
3457800,3458940," What was the flag?"
3458940,3460920," What was the ldflags?"
3460920,3461180," Okay."
3461180,3461820," Thank you so much."
3461820,3462240," Thank you."
3462700,3464440," Who needs chat gpt?"
3464440,3465040," Am I right?"
3465040,3466680," Flags."
3466680,3470540," And so, here come my flags."
3470540,3472440," You can't see shit in this mist."
3472440,3474360," And I understand that."
3475060,3476740," So, this is going to be libs."
3476740,3480240," And on top of that, we're going to just do raylib."
3480240,3482020," Maybe lib."
3482020,3483900," Raylib a."
3483900,3486000," We're going to link it statically."
3486000,3486880," Okay."
3486880,3488240," We're going to link it statically."
3488900,3492180," So, now m4 in here."
3492180,3494100," I'm going to just do this stuff in here."
3494100,3496500," And it doesn't even fucking compile."
3496500,3502140," Checking whether the c compiler works."
3502140,3502740," No."
3502740,3507400," C compiler cannot create execute."
3507400,3512220," Oh, yeah."
3512220,3512960," So, okay."
3512960,3513320," I see."
3513320,3515340," It has to be big L."
3517760,3519000," It didn't help."
3519000,3520840," Big L didn't help."
3520840,3526180," So, let's take a look at the config logs, I suppose."
3526180,3528000," What do we have in config logs?"
3528000,3530840," Configure exits."
3530840,3538220," So, ldflags."
3538220,3540580," All right."
3540580,3543620," Is it not libs?"
3543620,3544560," It's just lib."
3544560,3545980," Am I a dummy?"
3545980,3547560," Yeah, I am a dummy dum-dum."
3547760,3548940," It's not libs."
3548940,3549660," It's a lib."
3549660,3550960," It's a single one."
3550960,3552460," Still no."
3552460,3554700," What the fuck is going on?"
3554700,3556980," So, is that because of the ldflags shit?"
3556980,3557560," Really?"
3557560,3559260," Is that the actual reason?"
3559260,3559840," I can't."
3559840,3561400," Yeah, it is the actual reason."
3561400,3562960," So, it doesn't like ldflags."
3562960,3565440," Am I going crazy?"
3566900,3568900," It's angry because of the missing space?"
3568900,3570540," You think it's because of the missing space?"
3570540,3571760," I don't think so, bruv."
3571760,3572100," No."
3572100,3574280," It just doesn't like that because fuck me."
3574280,3576180," Too many flags."
3576180,3576540," Maybe."
3576540,3577840," Maybe that's the case, actually."
3577840,3580320," Maybe because of the second flag in here."
3580320,3580780," Right."
3580780,3582960," So, you can't see shit, by the way."
3582960,3584820," Let me actually lift me up a little bit."
3584880,3586420," So, now you can see some shit."
3586420,3590820," Just like I've seen some shit, now you can see some."
3590820,3591540," Okay."
3591540,3592040," Okay."
3592040,3592620," We'll figure that."
3592620,3594660," This is because of the second argument in here."
3594660,3597240," Can we..."
3597240,3597460," Okay."
3597460,3599400," What if I..."
3599400,3603040," How can we have several files in here?"
3603040,3605160," Pass it as a cflags."
3605160,3607820," But can you put spaces in here?"
3607820,3609020," Okay."
3609020,3609680," You can."
3609680,3615120," So, and then I can put llib array lib a."
3615120,3617660," It doesn't fucking work."
3617660,3619720," It doesn't..."
3619720,3625200," Yeah, l with colon because it lets me explicitly say what kind of library I want to have in here."
3625200,3629640," I can just, like, use that, but it will, by default, pick up the dynamic one."
3629640,3630700," Right."
3630700,3631680," So, okay."
3631680,3634340," LD flags don't fucking work, mate."
3634340,3637340," Who said LD flags?"
3637340,3639480," Who?"
3639480,3642520," Chat, we need to ban those people."
3642520,3646120," I think these people have debated me that LD flags actually works."
3646120,3647860," I think they debated me."
3647860,3650040," All right."
3650040,3651320," So, let me see."
3651320,3652360," No."
3653860,3655120," l without the colon?"
3655120,3655600," No."
3655600,3658680," No, no, no, no, no, no."
3658680,3659400," Okay."
3659400,3663060," So, is raylib only dynamically linked in?"
3663060,3665340," It's actually both dynamically and statically."
3665340,3668180," For some freaking reason."
3668180,3671440," For some freaking reason, I just can't do that."
3671440,3674960," Did you compile raylib?"
3674960,3676380," I have already pre-compiled."
3676380,3679220," You use LD flags wrong."
3679220,3680460," Thank you, Sherlock."
3680460,3682940," Very fucking cool."
3683860,3689080," Ah, it doesn't even tell me what's wrong."
3689080,3690200," That's the problem, actually."
3690200,3693700," It doesn't even tell me because I don't see errors in the log."
3693700,3695580," Right."
3695580,3698900," So, there's no errors whatsoever."
3698900,3700700," So, LD flags."
3703400,3707400," So, I don't know."
3707400,3709960," This one contains any message produced by the compiler."
3709960,3711540," Uh-huh."
3711540,3714600," Maybe I can go up there."
3714600,3719100," But I can't find."
3721440,3723220," xlocal."
3723220,3725160," Compilation."
3725160,3726480," Is that right?"
3726480,3729420," Hmm."
3729420,3734020," I think that might be the case."
3734020,3739820," Someone needs to make a compiler that just says no when it fails."
3739820,3740900," No other bs."
3741140,3741320," Yeah."
3741320,3743860," Checking for xlocal."
3743860,3744320," Okay."
3744320,3747260," So, I guess that's what happened in here."
3747260,3749000," It couldn't find xlocal."
3749000,3755900," Probably because something messed up some of the things in here."
3761160,3763900," Those are the logs, not the failing ones."
3763900,3767160," Whatever, dude."
3767160,3768080," Dude, whatever."
3768080,3769180," Shit doesn't work."
3769180,3770100," We need to fix it."
3770100,3771000," Shit doesn't work."
3771000,3771760," We need to fix it."
3771760,3772320," Okay."
3772320,3775300," So, I'm already streaming for like one hour or so."
3775300,3778180," I think I need to x11 devil."
3778180,3778900," No, excellent."
3779080,3780200," But why do I need to?"
3780200,3785180," Hmm."
3785180,3789940," So, what is the conf test C file?"
3789940,3791400," That's a good question, actually."
3791400,3792060," Let's find it."
3792060,3793400," Find the people asking good questions."
3793400,3798240," So, type F, name, conf test C."
3798240,3799480," It doesn't exist."
3799480,3803880," Conf test C is probably generated automatically."
3803880,3806080," Probably dangerous."
3806080,3808120," You know, look, I don't like this hack."
3808120,3813960," So, using C flag and LD flags is already hacked on its own, isn't it?"
3813960,3814540," Right."
3814540,3818400," The proper way to deal with this kind of shit is to actually edit somewhere in"
3818400,3822320," makefilein or makefileam or some other stuff."
3822320,3822980," You know?"
3822980,3824760," You know what I'm saying?"
3824760,3826120," Do you feel in it?"
3826120,3827260," Do you feel in my bro's case?"
3827260,3829000," That's what it has to be, right?"
3829000,3831900," So, C flags and stuff like that."
3831900,3834080," So, this is where..."
3834080,3837280," And then you have to recreate the whole thing, right?"
3837280,3840080," So, you have to regenerate the config flags."
3840080,3844160," LD flags separated by comma."
3844160,3844700," No."
3844700,3847180," No, no, no."
3847180,3847660," Chat, chat."
3847660,3849220," We need to make a small break."
3849220,3850400," We need to make a small break."
3850400,3851560," We need to make a cup of tea."
3851560,3854440," And once we have a cup of tea, we can fucking do that, mate."
3855600,3856780," We can fucking do that."
3856780,3858220," So, all right."
3858220,3858740," Let's make a small break."
3858740,3859980," And all right."
3859980,3863420," So, on the break, we kind of discussed a little bit."
3863420,3865480," And I think I kind of know what's the problem in here."
3865900,3871720," So, it uses these flags for all the possible commands, including the ones that for just"
3871720,3873660," tasting the compilers and stuff like that."
3873900,3881000," And, you see, the paths in here are relative, which means that they only work only within"
3881000,3883500," a specific folder in a system."
3883500,3886860," But the commands could be actually run from all different folders, right?"
3886860,3889400," So, they could be maybe run from the root folder."
3889400,3893080," They may be run from maybe m4 or something."
3893160,3894000," Like, we don't know."
3894000,3898120," The build system may actually decide from what folder run all of these things."
3898120,3904640," So, and maybe one of the solutions to this problem could be to literally not use relative"
3904640,3908980," paths, but rather use absolute paths, right?"
3908980,3911100," So, let's actually give it a try."
3911100,3912960," So, how can we do that?"
3912960,3919240," We can just use something like, I don't know, the variable pwd, right?"
3919240,3924140," Which actually gives you the absolute path in here, but not in here specifically, right?"
3924140,3925400," So, let's go into m4."
3925400,3929260," And if I try to do echo pwd, right?"
3929260,3930700," So, it gives me, like, this path."
3930700,3935720," And you can construct an absolute path using this variable, hopefully."
3935720,3941680," So, I'm going to just select the syntax, I think, pwd, right?"
3941680,3944420," And let's hope that it's going to work."
3944420,3948240," So, and it doesn't fucking work."
3948240,3950080," So, it was not that, apparently."
3950080,3952280," Was not that."
3952280,3953840," Huh."
3953840,3956280," Oh, this is because libs."
3956280,3957280," Yeah, yeah."
3957280,3960100," I'm still using libs, so it contains..."
3960100,3961140," It was the problem."
3961140,3962060," Okay."
3962060,3963440," Holy fucking shit, guys."
3963440,3964520," We're getting there."
3964520,3965620," Okay."
3965620,3967760," We are fucking getting there, mate."
3967760,3972800," That's pretty pockers."
3972800,3974060," Cheers, by the way."
3976580,3978260," So, there's a lot of nonce."
3978260,3980960," Okay."
3980960,3985020," So, and let's just do make a minus G5."
3985020,3988500," And, okay."
3988500,3990580," Undefined reference."
3990580,3993040," Still undefined reference."
3993040,3997180," Still undefined reference."
3997520,4001540," Even though we said just link that shit there, still undefined reference."
4001540,4002700," Like, what the fuck, brother?"
4002700,4004500," How did that happen?"
4004500,4004900," Wait."
4004900,4006900," So, if I try to..."
4006900,4009980," I'm confused."
4012040,4013360," I'm ironically confused."
4013360,4017000," Like, it passed everything, but then it couldn't compile reylip."
4017000,4017720," Right."
4017720,4021620," Let's try to reconfigure this stuff by using just l-reylip."
4021620,4024580," It doesn't work."
4024580,4026840," Lib."
4026840,4029160," No."
4030880,4031440," Man."
4031440,4035460," I wish I just, like, knew what's the problem."
4035460,4036020," Right."
4036020,4041240," Knowing actual problem would have been so goddamn fucking helpful."
4041240,4044860," So, but I just don't know the actual problem."
4044860,4049960," It just simply refuses to work without explaining much."
4050940,4051420," Honestly."
4051420,4052860," Maybe I just need to..."
4052860,4054260," Maybe this is some caches."
4054260,4057060," And I need to clean everything."
4057060,4059420," So, that could be the case, actually."
4059420,4060400," Let's try to clean."
4060400,4069820," Who would have fucking thought that the bottleneck of this entire process is going to be some shitty, overbloated build system?"
4069820,4070480," Am I right?"
4070480,4080920," Like, how is it not obvious that all of the problems, all of the sources of problems out of this shitty, you know, build system that generate files,"
4080940,4084320," upon files, upon files, generators of generators of generators?"
4084320,4091620," Like, usually the actual problem is very easy to fix, but you always have to go to all of this building system bullshit."
4091620,4096480," Like, why is it not obvious to everyone that's what we want to simplify?"
4096480,4099760," Like, I just don't understand."
4099760,4104500," Like, it's so fucking obvious to me, and that's why I'm trying to get rid of all this build system, but I don't fucking know."
4104500,4106680," Me, I said it one hour."
4106680,4106920," Yeah."
4107400,4111360," So, it's like, everything is so simple, except this one thing."
4111360,4116400," It's just like, and it's the stupidest reason ever, actually, to be stuck on."
4116400,4118320," Stupidest reason ever."
4118320,4119800," Absolutely fucking dumb."
4119800,4123640," But at the same time, everyone is totally fine with that."
4123640,4125760," Nobody sees any problem with that."
4126620,4130180," So, yeah, so, it doesn't work like that, and we don't know why."
4130180,4133340," Like, there's literally no way to know why, because fuck you."
4133340,4138580," Though, interestingly, like, it doesn't show everything."
4138580,4145600," So, if I try to do minus B, CD path, like, what the fuck is CD path ZSH version?"
4145600,4147200," Like, what the fuck is that?"
4148940,4155280," Why is that Emacs doing?"
4155280,4159140," Why the fuck Emacs is doing this shit?"
4159140,4160140," Like, I never noticed that."
4160140,4163180," Bad English."
4163180,4164280," ZSH version."
4172900,4173780," So, anyways."
4173780,4177200," Oh, it's probably..."
4177200,4179700," Oh, it's makefile doing that."
4179700,4182280," Okay, so, I'm being stupid a little bit, because I'm tilted."
4182280,4190180," So, when I do minus B, it tries to update some configure AC or shit like that."
4190180,4192480," So, maybe this is not what we actually want to do."
4193640,4197260," But, yeah, so, we can't just link this shit easily."
4197260,4199880," We can't just leave this shit in there."
4199880,4200780," I wonder if I can..."
4200780,4206380," Okay, so, I can open the generated makefile, which is 2,000, you know, lines of code,"
4206380,4210600," which I can't really zoom in properly, because XFC window manager is shit."
4210600,4214520," We can try to find where is the..."
4214520,4221420," Yeah, you can't really fucking find the target that is responsible for generating all of these things,"
4221420,4223900," because it's all spread across this entire shit."
4223900,4226180," I fucking hate these build systems."
4226180,4227400," They're so fucking dumb."
4227400,4229240," They solve no problems whatsoever."
4229240,4231300," They've just been there to piss you off."
4231300,4233600," Anyways."
4233600,4237920," So, main.mk..."
4237920,4242600," I just want to add a link flag somewhere."
4242600,4246840," I just want to stick a link flag somewhere, and I can't fucking do that."
4247220,4254940," All right, so, what if it's not about the, you know, the flags?"
4254940,4257940," All right, what if it's not about the flags?"
4257940,4267660," Can we just simply do configure, help, and maybe see flags?"
4269300,4270920," No, it has to be..."
4270920,4273560," So, I remember somebody was doing ld flags."
4273560,4273960," Nah."
4273960,4280080," Linky flags, for example, ld if you have libraries in a non-standard libdir."
4280080,4281140," Ooh!"
4281140,4286200," Libs should go here, actually."
4286200,4288680," Okay, okay, okay."
4288680,4290700," So, it's actually three separate..."
4290700,4291380," All right."
4291380,4293040," Why nobody told me that?"
4293040,4295100," Why nobody fucking told me that, chat?"
4295520,4296180," What the fuck?"
4296180,4297620," All right."
4297620,4300620," So, let's put this stuff in here."
4300620,4304120," So, this is that, and this is going to be libs, like so."
4304120,4309560," Hopefully, maybe, that will finally fix that shit."
4309560,4310800," Let's go."
4310800,4313060," Let's fucking go."
4313060,4321540," You have to do a lot of busy work, exactly."
4321820,4323600," That's exactly what it's designed for."
4323600,4328140," To drain money from the investors."
4328140,4330380," To pretend that you are working."
4330380,4332980," That's what it's designed for."
4332980,4334480," And I can already feel that."
4334480,4336580," It brings back all of my office job."
4336580,4338780," Fucking finally, bruv!"
4338780,4340080," Oh my god!"
4340080,4342400," It complains about math library."
4345900,4347940," For fuck's sake, mate!"
4347940,4349200," For fuck's sake!"
4349200,4349620," Okay."
4349620,4351740," So, let's actually add math library."
4351740,4354900," So, let's go."
4354900,4355400," Boom!"
4355400,4356900," Let's reconfigure this, motherfucker."
4356900,4358240," Dup, dup, dup, dup, dup."
4358240,4359460," First try, by the way."
4359460,4360080," Got Cooter!"
4360080,4360960," Got Cooter!"
4360960,4361760," Let's go!"
4361760,4364960," Let's fucking go!"
4364960,4367620," All right."
4369620,4375960," Okay, so, the fans are starting to work, right?"
4375960,4379140," And we're just configuring some shit, right?"
4379140,4380980," So, and the fans already starting to work."
4380980,4381440," Let's go."
4381440,4389740," I swear to God, like, m4 is something that should be a single compiler command."
4389740,4392000," Just a single CC."
4396000,4397540," Just a single fucking CC."
4397540,4398960," You can argue."
4398960,4401840," Look at how much code you have."
4401840,4402480," Right."
4402480,4403480," So, you can argue."
4403480,4405500," So, let's take a look at all of these C files."
4405500,4407520," And look at that."
4407520,4409560," It's almost 10k lines of..."
4409560,4416840," How on earth can you compile all of that efficiently with just a single, you know, command line and stuff like that?"
4416840,4419360," Have you seen Mini Audio, my friends?"
4419360,4422120," Do you know what is a Mini Audio?"
4422120,4425280," I'm going to show you something cool, actually."
4425280,4426640," Google app Mini Audio."
4426640,4429840," Just look at that."
4429840,4430520," Look, Mini Audio."
4430520,4434440," A single file audio playback capture library."
4434440,4436740," Let's download this bitch."
4436740,4441280," So, let's go here."
4441280,4442300," W get."
4442300,4444080," I'm going to actually put it in here."
4444080,4445800," Right."
4445800,4448940," It's 3.8 megabytes, first of all."
4453340,4457320," 1,000 lines of fucking code."
4457320,4461460," You can compile it with a single C command line."
4461460,4463420," And it's going to be fast, my friend."
4463420,4464900," It's going to be fucking fast."
4464900,4466200," Right."
4466200,4468000," So, I can just do CC."
4468000,4469580," Actually, C."
4469580,4473280," I probably have to do XC to tell it that it's a C code."
4473280,4474680," And it's just going to do something like that."
4478000,4480040," What the fuck?"
4480040,4483640," Well, I mean, okay, it didn't include implementation."
4483640,4487940," So, let's actually include some of the implementations as we compile this entire thing."
4487940,4489020," Okay, that's fair enough."
4489020,4492560," That's it."
4496560,4503600," It's a single file bigger than M4."
4503600,4509660," It doesn't require any fancy auto-tools generators with M4 and MIG file."
4509660,4511720," None of that."
4511720,4514320," Single compilation command."
4514320,4516060," That's how we should."
4517540,4523720," This is actually like a proof that all of that shit is literally for busy work."
4523720,4526780," It is literally for busy work."
4526780,4531140," It has no purpose except just to fiddle with that."
4531140,4532560," Fucking useless."
4533740,4536320," And also, there is a good example, SQLite amalgamation."
4536320,4536700," Right."
4536700,4541040," So, SQLite amalgamation file is basically a concatenation of all of the SQLite files."
4541040,4541340," Right."
4541340,4543680," So, you can compile it with a single C command as well."
4543680,4544600," Right."
4544600,4545320," It's actually bigger."
4545320,4548100," I think it's 200,000 lines of code."
4548100,4549460," So, twice as much."
4549460,4553220," So, yeah."
4553220,4555520," I really don't understand that."
4555520,4561340," And I think that the only people who defend this kind of systems"
4561340,4564280," are the ones who are benefiting from them"
4564280,4568800," by sitting in the office doing nothing except fiddling with this shit,"
4568800,4570620," draining the monies of investors."
4570620,4571980," I'm going to say that."
4571980,4574000," I think the only people who defend this kind of shit"
4574000,4576020," are those kind of people who are benefiting from them."
4576020,4578380," And honestly, if I worked at an office,"
4578380,4580080," I would be also defending this kind of shit."
4580080,4580300," Right."
4580300,4582600," So, because I'm doing nothing useful,"
4582600,4584100," sitting just all day in the office,"
4584100,4586040," fiddling with that and getting paid,"
4586040,4587940," regardless of the outcome,"
4587940,4589780," at the end of the month, give me that."
4589780,4591020," So, yeah."
4591340,4592460," Job security."
4592460,4596480," Job security through obscurity actually works."
4596480,4598080," Isn't that amazing?"
4598080,4599140," It's fucking amazing."
4599140,4602900," So, yeah."
4602900,4607120," Fucking amazing, my friend."
4607120,4615120," Bureaucracy-driven development."
4615320,4619000," And it works so fucking perfectly"
4619000,4620620," because all of these managers"
4620620,4623920," are completely fucking computer illiterate."
4623920,4626320," They're so fucking computer illiterate,"
4626320,4629420," they can't even comprehend that all of that is just bullshit."
4629420,4632020," Like, they just don't know."
4632020,4633020," Maybe they do know."
4633020,4634940," And they're just playing into that game."
4634940,4635620," I don't fucking know."
4636280,4636980," But anyways,"
4636980,4638580," we, I suppose,"
4638580,4640000," managed to compile this entire thing."
4640000,4640280," Right."
4640280,4640660," So,"
4640660,4642640," let me,"
4642640,4643120," let me,"
4643120,4643940," let me see."
4643940,4644540," What were we doing?"
4644540,4645240," I forgot."
4645240,4646920," All right."
4646920,4648640," So, let me try to build this entire thing"
4648640,4649460," and it compiles."
4649460,4650040," Okay, cool."
4650520,4650880," So,"
4650880,4652160," what we want to do,"
4652160,4653480," we're going to go into your mom."
4653480,4654100," All right."
4654100,4655200," And I'm going to just run"
4655200,4658000," SRC M4 on your mom."
4658000,4659000," And there we go."
4659000,4659820," So, it says 69."
4659820,4660820," Your mom is a nice lady."
4660820,4661580," But now,"
4661580,4662660," here's the moment of truth."
4662660,4663540," Can I"
4663540,4665060," init a window"
4665060,4666320," out of this shit?"
4666320,4667560," I can."
4667560,4669680," And it actually started"
4669680,4671200," fucking raging."
4675640,4679160," So, we just"
4679160,4680280," officially called"
4680280,4681620," a Raylib function"
4681620,4682720," from"
4682720,4684220," M4 script."
4684220,4688440," Raylib is so"
4688440,4689660," goddamn cross-platform,"
4689660,4690500," you can call it"
4690500,4691180," from anything."
4691180,4693040," You can literally"
4693040,4693860," call it from anything."
4693860,4694780," And guess what?"
4694780,4695480," It is written"
4695480,4696380," in pure C."
4696380,4698720," So,"
4698720,4700160," speaking of whether"
4700160,4701360," C is relevant"
4701360,4702200," in 2024,"
4702200,4703560," piece of code"
4703560,4704520," written in C"
4704520,4705740," literally works"
4705740,4706500," everywhere."
4706500,4709160," Not everywhere"
4709160,4710160," where there is"
4710160,4710640," a browser."
4710640,4711440," Everywhere."
4711440,4713980," Fucking"
4713980,4715200," everywhere."
4715200,4716340," Not just"
4716340,4717100," where there is"
4717100,4717900," a browser."
4717900,4719080," Fucking"
4719080,4719960," everywhere."
4719960,4721760," That's why"
4721760,4722360," C"
4722360,4724080," is a programming"
4724080,4724900," language of"
4724900,4726120," planet Earth."
4726120,4728900," It is a programming"
4728900,4729420," language of"
4729420,4729840," planet Earth."
4729840,4730560," Humanity"
4730560,4731920," programs in C."
4731920,4733780," And occasionally"
4733780,4735120," just wraps around"
4735120,4736600," C code"
4736600,4737240," with more"
4737240,4737820," convenient"
4737820,4738720," wrappers and"
4738720,4739000," stuff."
4739000,4740040," But humanity"
4740040,4741440," programs in C."
4741440,4742180," Whether you like"
4742180,4742580," it or not."
4742580,4743140," I personally"
4743140,4743880," fucking hate it."
4743880,4744540," I think C is"
4744540,4744800," shit."
4744800,4746380," But that's just"
4746380,4747060," like how it"
4747060,4747780," ended up being."
4747780,4748860," And I'm saying"
4748860,4749220," all of that"
4749220,4749760," not because I'm"
4749760,4750380," a huge fan of C."
4750380,4751160," I fucking hate it."
4751160,4752180," I'm just pointing"
4752180,4753280," out the truth."
4753280,4755640," It's a shady"
4755640,4756320," language, but it's"
4756320,4756860," fucking everywhere."
4756860,4757560," It's a programming"
4757560,4758560," language of planet Earth."
4758560,4759040," I'm sorry."
4759040,4760420," Sorry to tell you"
4760420,4761100," that, but that's"
4761100,4761740," just the truth."
4761740,4766500," Anyways, cheers."
4766500,4768080," We'll get to"
4768080,4768320," that."
4768320,4768700," Don't worry"
4768700,4769280," about it."
4769280,4775600," So, yeah."
4775600,4776640," Anyways, my"
4776640,4777400," friend, my"
4777400,4779040," friend, you know"
4779040,4779340," what?"
4779340,4780060," Like, I want to be"
4780060,4780700," able to actually"
4780700,4782340," customize, like,"
4782340,4783760," what kind of, you"
4783760,4785160," know, size of the"
4785160,4785980," window I can put in"
4785980,4786880," here, what kind of"
4786880,4787800," other things, like,"
4787800,4789220," for example, hello"
4789220,4790820," from your mom"
4790820,4792840," m4 file, right?"
4792840,4793260," I want to be able"
4793260,4793920," to do these kind"
4793920,4794200," of things."
4794200,4794560," You know what I'm"
4794560,4795020," talking about?"
4795020,4796360," You're feeling me?"
4796360,4796900," You're feeling me,"
4796900,4797260," Mabrowski?"
4797260,4798220," Yeah, that's what I"
4798220,4798580," want to do."
4798580,4800440," So, but the"
4800440,4801180," question is how can"
4801180,4802660," we actually do all"
4802660,4803560," of that stuff, right?"
4803560,4804340," So, how can we"
4804340,4805320," even do all of"
4805320,4805620," that stuff?"
4805620,4806920," So, let's go into"
4806920,4808320," the built-ins and"
4808320,4809480," let's find m4"
4809480,4810560," init window."
4810560,4812760," Right, so we have"
4812760,4813660," arguments in here."
4813660,4817800," And so, we have"
4817800,4818560," to check the"
4818560,4819900," arity first, I"
4819900,4820200," suppose."
4820200,4821020," We have to say if"
4821020,4821480," the amount of"
4821480,4822100," arguments is not"
4822100,4823860," three, we have to"
4823860,4824980," throw an error of"
4824980,4825860," some sort, but I'm"
4825860,4826600," not pretty sure how"
4826600,4827400," exactly to do that."
4827400,4828680," So, let's actually"
4828680,4830360," find m4 shift."
4830360,4831180," I just want to look"
4831180,4831960," at some example."
4831960,4834780," Okay, bad arg c."
4834780,4836420," Okay, there is this"
4836420,4837140," thing called bad"
4837140,4838000," arg c."
4838000,4841200," Ooh, yo, this is"
4841200,4841720," actually kind of"
4841720,4841900," cool."
4842500,4843880," so, too few"
4843880,4844620," arguments to"
4844620,4844940," build."
4844940,4847640," Damn, brusky, what"
4847640,4848380," the fuck?"
4848380,4851240," So, bad arg,"
4851240,4855400," yo, so we can"
4855400,4857020," use that to"
4857020,4857960," report arguments."
4857960,4862340," Min max, ha, okay."
4862340,4864320," So, m4, init"
4864320,4865140," window, let's"
4865140,4865880," actually find this"
4865880,4866480," shit, I'm going to"
4866480,4867100," put this stuff in"
4867100,4867320," here."
4867320,4868220," All right, so"
4868220,4870080," arg v zero, so"
4870080,4870880," minimum is going to"
4870880,4871780," be three, maximum"
4871780,4872320," is going to be"
4872320,4872560," three."
4872560,4873220," This is what we're"
4873220,4873680," going to say in"
4873680,4873900," here."
4873900,4874760," All right, and"
4874760,4875960," then I'm going to"
4875960,4877280," try to recompile this"
4877280,4878380," entire stuff, right?"
4878380,4878980," So, we're going to"
4878980,4880020," recompile it with 16"
4880020,4881840," threads, right?"
4881840,4884060," As far as I know, I"
4884060,4885180," have, yeah, I have"
4885180,4887200," 16 CPUs, right?"
4887200,4887860," So, that means I have"
4887860,4889400," to use 17 threads."
4889400,4890480," Let's actually see how"
4890480,4890980," quickly it will"
4890980,4891760," recompile this entire"
4891760,4891980," thing."
4891980,4893660," Okay, so we recompile"
4893660,4894840," it within 200"
4894840,4896080," milliseconds, and it"
4896080,4897140," recompile it with an"
4897140,4897420," error."
4897420,4897720," error."
4897720,4899100," So, it failed"
4899100,4899760," quickly."
4899760,4901060," It failed quickly."
4901060,4901980," So, what's up with"
4901980,4902160," that?"
4902160,4905940," So, okay, token"
4905940,4906920," previous implicit."
4906920,4909820," So, it's defined"
4909820,4911180," somewhere down there."
4911180,4913460," It's kind of give"
4913460,4914360," friendly warnings if"
4914360,4915380," built-in macro is"
4915380,4916020," passed on"
4916020,4917760," inappropriate, but I"
4917760,4918900," want to be able to"
4918900,4920920," use it up there."
4920920,4922200," So, am I just"
4922200,4922860," using it?"
4922860,4924280," You know what?"
4924280,4925660," I feel like all of"
4925660,4927020," the macro things, like"
4927020,4929080," macro your mom, should"
4929080,4930240," be actually defined"
4930240,4932040," after some helpers."
4932040,4934520," Yeah, we need to"
4934520,4935200," move them."
4935200,4936820," We actually need to"
4936820,4937300," move them."
4937300,4939220," Okay, so this is"
4939220,4939560," that."
4939560,4940860," I need to put a new"
4940860,4941680," page in here."
4941680,4946580," So, how can we"
4946580,4948080," even do all of that"
4948080,4948580," stuff?"
4949080,4950440," I feel like we"
4950440,4951480," need to find the"
4951480,4953240," first macro, which"
4953240,4957240," is m4 file."
4957240,4958560," So, here it is."
4958560,4960800," Print all arguments."
4960800,4962440," Okay, make steps."
4962440,4963920," Make temp."
4963920,4965000," Aha."
4965000,4966520," Okay, so I presume"
4966520,4967520," that this is where"
4967520,4969760," all helpers stop"
4969760,4970720," and we will be able"
4970720,4971500," to do something"
4971500,4972300," like this."
4972300,4974200," All right."
4974200,4976520," Aha."
4976520,4978160," So, I'm not sure."
4978320,4979060," It's kind of weird"
4979060,4980220," all of that, but"
4980220,4983780," honestly, what if I"
4983780,4984560," just put that at"
4984560,4985300," the bottom?"
4985300,4986980," Let's just put"
4986980,4987640," everything at the"
4987640,4987860," bottom."
4987860,4989740," Aha."
4989740,4991160," I think that would"
4991160,4991820," make sense."
4991820,4993440," All right."
4993440,4994140," Let's try to rebuild"
4994140,4995260," this entire thing, and"
4995260,4996060," it works."
4996060,4996500," All right."
4996500,4997180," And after that, I"
4997180,4997860," think I'm going to"
4997860,4999460," actually run this"
4999460,5000600," entire thing right"
5000600,5000920," away."
5000920,5003640," So, let's go to"
5003640,5004060," your mom."
5004520,5005320," I'm going to just"
5005320,5005980," remove."
5005980,5007340," Maybe I just put"
5007340,5008920," dnl in here, like"
5008920,5009200," so."
5009200,5012100," And let's just do"
5012100,5015440," src m4, your mom"
5015440,5016040," m4."
5016040,5017600," Too few arguments"
5017600,5018700," to build in init"
5018700,5019060," window."
5019060,5020000," All right."
5020000,5021900," But it's actually"
5021900,5022700," just a warning."
5022700,5024000," It's not an error"
5024000,5025680," of any sort, so I"
5025680,5026340," don't really like"
5026340,5026680," that."
5027680,5028800," bad arg."
5028800,5029900," Let me see."
5029900,5030520," Let me see."
5030520,5032860," So, bad arg."
5032860,5033500," It's a friendly"
5033500,5034020," warning."
5034020,5038440," But it's m4 error."
5038440,5040920," I suppose it's"
5040920,5041260," fine."
5041260,5041660," Right."
5041660,5042540," So, it's kind of"
5042540,5042740," fine."
5042740,5043900," Okay."
5043900,5045460," So, what we need"
5045460,5045780," to do?"
5045780,5046560," We need to"
5046560,5047620," actually parse"
5047620,5049540," specific integers"
5049540,5050240," and stuff like"
5050240,5050400," that."
5050400,5051440," So, let's take a"
5051440,5052500," look at m4"
5052500,5053580," in core macro."
5053580,5054580," Let's take a"
5054580,5054960," look at it."
5054960,5056440," So, what it"
5056440,5057140," does, it"
5057140,5057920," checks that the"
5057920,5058860," first argument is"
5058860,5060200," a numeric argument."
5060200,5061700," So, that's probably"
5061700,5062420," something that we"
5062420,5062740," want to do."
5062740,5063880," So, it allocates"
5063880,5065760," like int value and"
5065760,5066620," just parses it like"
5066620,5066800," that."
5066800,5067960," So, I think we can"
5067960,5069060," actually do something"
5069060,5069780," about that."
5069780,5071220," Right."
5071220,5073260," So, let's go to"
5073260,5074600," here and"
5074600,5076120," essentially we're"
5076120,5076740," going to have"
5076740,5077860," width and we're"
5077860,5078560," going to have a"
5078560,5078980," height."
5078980,5079820," Right."
5079820,5080880," So, the first"
5080880,5082420," arg1 is going"
5082420,5083900," to be width and"
5083900,5084600," the second one is"
5084600,5085780," going to be height."
5086600,5087560," So, the"
5087560,5088320," question is, is"
5088320,5088980," there some"
5088980,5089960," other arg"
5089960,5090980," functions?"
5090980,5092980," Is there some"
5092980,5093180," other?"
5093180,5093780," So, there's a"
5093780,5094800," numeric arg, but"
5094800,5095540," what if I want"
5095540,5096780," string arg?"
5096780,5099780," We can try to"
5099780,5100140," take a look."
5100140,5100860," Like, what kind of"
5100860,5101780," macros built-ins"
5101780,5102880," accept strings?"
5102880,5104800," m4 define"
5104800,5105700," probably accept"
5105700,5106680," a string first."
5106680,5107760," Okay, define"
5107760,5108800," macro in here."
5109520,5111300," So, token data."
5111300,5113140," Okay, so, they're"
5113140,5115840," explicitly looking at"
5115840,5116620," the type of the"
5116620,5117620," token and if it's"
5117620,5118620," a text, if it's"
5118620,5119300," not text, they"
5119300,5120560," say, right, so"
5120560,5121740," it's not defined."
5121740,5124160," Okay, so, we can"
5124160,5125880," try to yoink this"
5125880,5127280," idea from here as"
5127280,5127500," well."
5127500,5128020," Right."
5128020,5129560," So, let's actually"
5129560,5130000," go back."
5130000,5131620," And then, what else"
5131620,5132380," do they do with"
5132380,5132920," this argument,"
5132920,5133380," actually?"
5133380,5134020," What else do they"
5134020,5134440," do with this"
5134440,5134700," argument?"
5136480,5137340," So, they only"
5137340,5138140," check the type,"
5138140,5139440," which is kind of"
5139440,5140600," useless, I think."
5140600,5142980," Define macro."
5142980,5144920," All right, so,"
5144920,5146660," define user macro."
5146660,5147600," They just do it"
5147600,5148120," like that."
5148120,5150580," Ah, it accepts"
5150580,5150760," it."
5150760,5155380," So, arg returns"
5155380,5157020," string, if I"
5157020,5158080," understand correctly."
5158080,5160500," So, token data"
5160500,5161260," text."
5161260,5162660," Uh-huh."
5162660,5164560," All right, so, it"
5164560,5165360," returns it as a"
5165360,5166160," text, literally."
5166480,5168020," So, we can"
5168020,5169440," actually try to do"
5169440,5170040," something about"
5170040,5170280," that."
5170280,5171380," Invalid macro"
5171380,5173140," name ignored."
5173140,5174480," All right, so,"
5174480,5176560," what we want to"
5176560,5177740," do in here, we"
5177740,5178960," just want to say"
5178960,5180820," that"
5180820,5182900," invalid"
5182900,5184480," title"
5184480,5185560," ignored."
5185560,5187380," All right, so,"
5187380,5188180," invalid title"
5188180,5188700," ignored."
5188700,5189620," And this is going"
5189620,5190040," to be just a"
5190040,5190460," return."
5190460,5192140," But after that,"
5192140,5193680," and it has to"
5193680,5194120," be, by the way,"
5194120,5195780," this one has to"
5195780,5197220," be three, I"
5197220,5198620," presume, and"
5198620,5199340," then we just"
5199340,5200740," do arg"
5200740,5201720," three."
5201720,5203220," So, that's how"
5203220,5203660," we're going to"
5203660,5204160," parse the"
5204160,5204560," command line"
5204560,5205040," arguments."
5205040,5205920," You know what's"
5205920,5208140," cool about this"
5208140,5209640," approach that I'm"
5209640,5210480," using in here?"
5210480,5212780," I'm extracting the"
5212780,5213980," knowledge out of"
5213980,5214720," the code base."
5214720,5217560," I have no idea"
5217560,5218860," how to parse"
5218860,5219960," arguments of"
5219960,5220600," built-ins."
5221540,5222520," like, I never"
5222520,5223040," worked with"
5223040,5224020," them for, right?"
5224020,5224700," So, I don't"
5224700,5225360," really know this"
5225360,5225900," code base."
5225900,5227700," But, I just"
5227700,5229080," looked around at"
5229080,5229960," other functions,"
5229960,5230960," saw how they"
5230960,5231580," do that, and"
5231580,5232480," you saw me, I"
5232480,5233140," literally just"
5233140,5234120," copy-pasted chunks"
5234120,5234920," of code into"
5234920,5236280," here, and I"
5236280,5236720," just sort of"
5236720,5237720," retrofitted these"
5237720,5238480," chunks of code"
5238480,5239420," into my case."
5239420,5241860," I basically"
5241860,5242940," extracted the"
5242940,5243580," knowledge out"
5243580,5244340," of code base."
5244340,5245940," Code bases"
5245940,5248300," contain knowledge."
5249100,5249740," You, as a"
5249740,5250720," programmer, must"
5250720,5251720," learn how to"
5251720,5252920," extract that"
5252920,5253420," knowledge."
5253420,5254640," How to"
5254640,5255180," extract that"
5255180,5255540," knowledge."
5255540,5257400," Open secret of"
5257400,5257820," senior programmer."
5257820,5258320," Exactly!"
5258320,5260160," Being a senior"
5260160,5261540," software developer"
5261540,5262200," is literally"
5262200,5262960," knowing how to"
5262960,5263580," do what I"
5263580,5264240," just did."
5264240,5265480," Right?"
5265480,5267100," Because the"
5267100,5268220," first sign of"
5268220,5269240," junior is just"
5269240,5269720," looking at the"
5269720,5270460," code base and"
5270460,5271280," not knowing how"
5271280,5271900," to do a certain"
5271900,5272640," thing and go"
5272640,5273280," ask it."
5273280,5274560," Seniors just"
5274560,5275500," look around at"
5275500,5276140," the source code,"
5276140,5276980," see how it's"
5276980,5277460," done in other"
5277460,5277920," places, and it's"
5277920,5278480," just replicated."
5279100,5280780," So, that's"
5280780,5281300," how it works."
5281300,5282860," That creates,"
5282860,5283820," though, very"
5283820,5284600," interesting side"
5284600,5285500," effects, actually."
5285500,5287300," So, you may"
5287300,5288360," have a particular"
5288360,5289960," useful piece of"
5289960,5291600," code that"
5291600,5292340," contains a"
5292340,5292740," little bit of"
5292740,5293480," a crappiness,"
5293480,5294700," maybe even"
5294700,5295240," contains a"
5295240,5295600," little bit of"
5295600,5295940," a code."
5295940,5296780," And if"
5296780,5298080," everyone starts"
5298080,5299220," to copy-paste"
5299220,5300100," these useful"
5300100,5300700," pieces of"
5300700,5301200," codes like"
5301200,5302320," that, an"
5302320,5303220," error or"
5303220,5304000," crappiness"
5304000,5305880," basically spreads"
5305880,5306360," itself."
5306360,5307160," It basically"
5307160,5308160," multiplies."
5309100,5309780," right."
5309780,5311280," So, some"
5311280,5311820," pieces of"
5311820,5313340," codes become"
5313340,5314320," kind of like"
5314320,5315700," viruses that"
5315700,5316840," spread across"
5316840,5317340," your entire"
5317340,5318100," code base and"
5318100,5318720," become difficult"
5318720,5319240," to sort of"
5319240,5320220," get them out"
5320220,5320540," of it."
5320540,5322180," So, yes,"
5322180,5323060," this software"
5323060,5324000," transmitted disease."
5324000,5324960," Code"
5324960,5325400," certification."
5325400,5326360," Yeah, because"
5326360,5328180," copy-pasting this"
5328180,5328860," piece of code is"
5328860,5329700," just easy at the"
5329700,5330900," time, but then"
5330900,5331860," you have to"
5331860,5332520," spend effort"
5332520,5333480," cleaning things"
5333480,5333700," up."
5334880,5335820," and cleaning"
5335820,5336520," things up is"
5336520,5337940," rather difficult."
5337940,5341140," You have to"
5341140,5342100," properly clean"
5342100,5343200," things up and"
5343200,5343900," to properly"
5343900,5344780," reverse the"
5344780,5345760," entropy of your"
5345760,5346340," code, you"
5346340,5346860," have to do"
5346860,5347500," a very painful"
5347500,5349360," thing, which I"
5349360,5350180," think Jonathan"
5350180,5351000," blow calls like"
5351000,5351620," a sledgehammer"
5351620,5353020," programming, where"
5353020,5354140," you rip apart the"
5354140,5355240," entire code base"
5355240,5356000," to the state that"
5356000,5356780," it's not usable"
5356780,5357300," and not even"
5357300,5358220," compilable and"
5358220,5358960," kind of reassemble"
5358960,5359460," it back."
5360260,5361120," something that I"
5361120,5362040," recently did with"
5362040,5362780," Coil, by the"
5362780,5363060," way."
5363060,5365340," So, yeah,"
5365340,5366140," recently to"
5366140,5367360," rewrite Coil from"
5367360,5368240," TypeScript to"
5368240,5369260," C3, I had to"
5369260,5370120," sledgehammer the"
5370120,5371040," entire code base"
5371040,5373980," into Wasm"
5373980,5374380," module."
5374380,5376880," But as of"
5376880,5377540," right now,"
5377540,5379300," Coil is"
5379300,5381360," mostly Wasm."
5381360,5382540," It's mostly"
5382540,5382780," Wasm."
5382780,5383460," It has a"
5383460,5384040," little bit of a"
5384040,5384700," TypeScript, but"
5384700,5385940," I mean, yeah, so"
5385940,5386580," not that much."
5386580,5387500," Do we have a"
5387500,5388440," Coil in here, by"
5388440,5388760," the way?"
5388760,5389500," I think I don't"
5389500,5389940," have a Coil."
5390000,5390480," We can actually"
5390480,5390940," clip it."
5390940,5393140," I mean, clone"
5393140,5394260," the whole thing."
5394260,5399200," So, let's just"
5399200,5399760," grab this"
5399760,5402100," shit, and I'm"
5402100,5403480," going to just"
5403480,5404600," compile this"
5404600,5405120," entire thing."
5405120,5405520," So, it's a"
5405520,5406260," Git clone."
5406260,5409780," It's cloning."
5409780,5411640," Okay, so we'll"
5411640,5412320," clone this entire"
5412320,5412520," stuff."
5412520,5413720," All right."
5413720,5415100," So, I probably"
5415100,5415580," want to do"
5415580,5416040," something like"
5416040,5417160," npm install to"
5417160,5417880," install all the"
5417880,5418840," crappy dependencies"
5418840,5419600," of web."
5419740,5420640," So, 15"
5420640,5421220," packages, by"
5421220,5421560," the way, not"
5421560,5421880," that many."
5421880,5422900," The majority of"
5422900,5423280," the dependencies"
5423280,5424060," coming from the"
5424060,5424760," web server anyway."
5424760,5425480," So, we can"
5425480,5426140," try to make"
5426140,5427880," build, run"
5427880,5428620," build script."
5428620,5429840," Do I have, I"
5429840,5430520," don't have a C3"
5430520,5431440," compiler in here, so"
5431440,5431900," it's not going to"
5431900,5432420," build easily, but"
5432420,5433120," I don't really have"
5433120,5433560," to because the"
5433560,5434180," Wasm modules are"
5434180,5434360," there."
5434360,5435240," So, we can take a"
5435240,5436100," look at how many"
5436100,5438180," lines of TypeScript"
5438180,5438600," they have."
5438600,5439640," It's like 600"
5439640,5441280," lines of TypeScript"
5441280,5442060," and how many"
5442060,5442780," C3."
5442780,5443820," And C3 is"
5443820,5444320," 2000."
5444640,5445340," So, majority of"
5445340,5445780," the code is"
5445780,5447340," written in C3"
5447340,5449000," and compiled into"
5449000,5449600," Wasm module."
5449600,5451940," And, yeah, and"
5451940,5452400," the game still"
5452400,5452780," works."
5452780,5453920," It still works"
5453920,5455460," largely as it"
5455460,5456420," worked before."
5456420,5457420," So, if I go into"
5457420,5458440," GitHub.io"
5458440,5461220," coil, there we"
5461220,5461700," go, it still"
5461700,5461980," works."
5461980,5462460," And it's actually"
5462460,5463520," 60 FPS while I'm"
5463520,5464200," also streaming, but"
5464200,5464940," then I have a new"
5464940,5466300," laptop as well."
5466820,5467360," So, it largely"
5467360,5468360," works the same, but"
5468360,5469200," majority of the"
5469200,5469900," code, pretty much"
5469900,5471980," everything, is in"
5471980,5473400," Wasm, including"
5473400,5476380," producing and parsing"
5476380,5477260," binary protocol"
5477260,5477960," messages, right?"
5477960,5478740," Because it's a"
5478740,5479260," client-server"
5479260,5480560," application and it"
5480560,5481260," communicates through"
5481260,5482800," web sockets using"
5482800,5485580," binary protocol and"
5485580,5487760," client Wasm module"
5487760,5489260," produces the bytes"
5489260,5490620," of the binary"
5490620,5492180," protocol and server"
5492180,5493600," Wasm module parses"
5493600,5494360," the bytes of the"
5494360,5495020," binary protocol."
5495020,5496640," The only thing that"
5496640,5497760," JavaScript does in"
5497760,5498700," here is just it"
5498700,5499520," takes those bytes"
5499520,5500300," from the Wasm"
5500300,5501760," module memory and"
5501760,5502720," sends them over the"
5502720,5503220," web socket."
5503220,5504500," It doesn't deal with"
5504500,5505180," the bytes themselves."
5505180,5505880," It doesn't even know"
5505880,5506580," how to parse them."
5506580,5507460," All of the parsing"
5507460,5509240," and producing is"
5509240,5510020," actually done within"
5510020,5510840," the Wasm module."
5510840,5512060," So, a lot of, like,"
5512060,5513100," pretty much the"
5513100,5513880," entirety of the game"
5513880,5514380," is in Wasm."
5514380,5519420," Now, it's all in"
5519420,5519840," Wasm."
5519840,5520900," That's inhuman."
5520900,5522580," It's not that much."
5522580,5523980," It's only two and a"
5523980,5524820," half thousands of"
5524820,5525440," lines of code."
5526460,5528800," the entire game,"
5528800,5529960," the entire"
5529960,5530540," crappy game"
5530540,5531060," and finished game"
5531060,5532260," is just 2.5"
5532260,5532800," thousands of"
5532800,5533260," lines of code."
5533260,5534340," Again, mini audio"
5534340,5535580," is two hundred,"
5535580,5536580," not two hundred,"
5536580,5539280," ninety thousand"
5539280,5539920," lines of code."
5539920,5541080," Except if,"
5541080,5541840," well, okay,"
5541840,5542560," so let's not"
5542560,5543220," talk about it."
5543220,5544760," But, yeah."
5544760,5547020," So,"
5547020,5548700," Siphon is actually"
5548700,5549220," talking about"
5549220,5549940," very funny piece"
5549940,5550940," of code in"
5550940,5552040," in clients,"
5552040,5553000," right?"
5553000,5553560," So,"
5553560,5554160," where"
5554160,5556200," the JavaScript"
5556200,5557580," provides the"
5557580,5558480," modv for"
5558480,5559260," Wasm module"
5559260,5560300," because Wasm module"
5560300,5561020," as of right now"
5561020,5561660," cannot use"
5561660,5562280," its own"
5562280,5562820," fmodv."
5562820,5563600," So,"
5563600,5566200," I'm pretty sure"
5566200,5567740," Wasm virtual machine"
5567740,5568220," has"
5568220,5569620," an instruction"
5569620,5570500," for fmod"
5570500,5571960," and I'm pretty sure"
5571960,5572880," LLVM has an"
5572880,5573940," intrinsic to call"
5573940,5574620," that instruction."
5574620,5575300," It's just,"
5575420,5576000," at the time"
5576000,5577020," I didn't want"
5577020,5577760," to spend time."
5577760,5578420," It does not?"
5578420,5581980," Oh, my fucking God."
5581980,5582420," Okay,"
5582420,5583240," this situation"
5583240,5584080," is actually worse"
5584080,5584420," than any,"
5584420,5584840," okay."
5584840,5586640," Welcome to the"
5586640,5586880," web,"
5586880,5587540," everyone."
5587540,5588100," So,"
5588100,5589000," what can I say?"
5589000,5594420," What can I fucking"
5594420,5594720," say?"
5594720,5595400," Welcome to the"
5595400,5596100," web technologies."
5596100,5600240," They didn't put"
5600240,5601260," web to"
5601260,5602260," web assembly"
5602260,5603020," for nothing."
5603020,5605100," Right,"
5605200,5605800," there was a reason"
5605800,5606380," they put web"
5606380,5606720," in there."
5606720,5608120," Anyways,"
5608120,5609020," so I'm going to"
5609020,5609400," give the link"
5609400,5610480," to Coil"
5610480,5611460," and soon"
5611460,5611820," we're going to"
5611820,5612300," get back"
5612300,5612960," to the development"
5612960,5613380," on Coil,"
5613380,5613920," by the way."
5613920,5614380," So,"
5614380,5614700," we're going to"
5614700,5615060," get back"
5615060,5615720," because we're"
5615720,5616220," pretty close"
5616220,5616720," to actually"
5616720,5617300," this thing"
5617300,5617820," being rewritten"
5617820,5618260," in C3."
5618260,5618960," We're going"
5618960,5619480," to do some"
5619480,5620060," cool streams"
5620060,5620460," on that,"
5620460,5620860," right?"
5620860,5621280," So,"
5621280,5622220," we're going"
5622220,5622740," to write"
5622740,5623760," web assembly"
5623760,5624600," library"
5624600,5625560," for working"
5625560,5626260," with web"
5626260,5626540," sockets"
5626540,5628020," from scratch."
5628020,5628460," So,"
5628460,5628840," that's one"
5628840,5629160," of the things"
5629160,5629600," we can do."
5629600,5630540," And another"
5630540,5631280," thing is"
5631280,5631720," I want to"
5631720,5632280," create a native"
5632280,5632940," version of the"
5632940,5634040," client so you"
5634040,5634480," can play"
5634480,5635120," outside of"
5635120,5635520," the browser"
5635520,5636860," and I also"
5636860,5637360," want to preserve"
5637360,5638280," the browser"
5638280,5638780," version."
5638780,5639240," Right,"
5639240,5639740," I want to"
5639740,5640340," have a system"
5640340,5641380," where you can"
5641380,5641960," use either"
5641960,5642460," the browser"
5642460,5643500," client or"
5643500,5644100," a native"
5644100,5644800," client and"
5644800,5645240," they both"
5645240,5645880," work together"
5645880,5646340," to the point"
5646340,5646740," that one"
5646740,5647360," player can be"
5647360,5647760," in the browser"
5647760,5648040," and another"
5648040,5648580," player can be"
5648580,5649100," just using"
5649100,5649780," native application."
5650560,5651320," so that's my"
5651320,5652260," goal actually."
5652260,5653720," And by the"
5653720,5653820," way,"
5653820,5654180," I just got"
5654180,5654600," an idea."
5654600,5656000," Since all"
5656000,5656480," the rendering"
5656480,5657500," happening into"
5657500,5658000," the memory,"
5658000,5659540," we can actually"
5659540,5660580," make it display"
5660580,5662260," in a terminal"
5662260,5662940," so maybe we"
5662940,5663640," can create a"
5663640,5664420," version of"
5664420,5665240," the client that"
5665240,5665880," just prints"
5665880,5666740," stuff on the"
5666740,5667020," terminal."
5667020,5667800," We can do"
5667800,5668360," that, right?"
5668360,5668860," So, you can"
5668860,5669360," have three"
5669360,5670020," players, one"
5670020,5670480," plays from"
5670480,5670900," the browser,"
5670900,5671440," another one"
5671440,5672000," plays from"
5672000,5673260," X, another"
5673260,5673820," one plays"
5673820,5674400," from literally"
5674400,5675180," terminal without"
5675180,5676100," XORG or"
5676100,5676740," any GUI."
5678200,5678960," from Tui."
5678960,5679880," We can do"
5679880,5680140," that."
5680140,5680700," Like, it's"
5680700,5681000," technically"
5681000,5681440," possible,"
5681440,5681940," theoretically."
5681940,5682460," We should"
5682460,5682900," try that."
5682900,5684480," And, yeah,"
5684480,5684740," that would"
5684740,5685140," actually be"
5685140,5685740," fucking cool."
5685740,5689340," Yeah."
5689340,5691700," That's fucking"
5691700,5691900," cool."
5691900,5693080," So, we'll"
5693080,5693240," see."
5693240,5698980," I'm gonna"
5698980,5699420," pretend that"
5699420,5699800," I didn't see"
5699800,5699960," that."
5699960,5700660," Anyway, so,"
5700660,5704840," let's continue."
5708200,5708800," So, we have"
5708800,5709020," that."
5709020,5709700," I don't even"
5709700,5710180," know if the"
5710180,5710840," shit compiles."
5710840,5711680," I don't even"
5711680,5712160," know if the"
5712160,5712800," shit compiles."
5712800,5716340," So, let me"
5716340,5716620," see."
5716620,5717240," Let me see."
5717240,5717960," Make"
5717960,5719120," J17"
5719120,5720360," brother."
5720360,5721340," It compiles,"
5721340,5721960," I think."
5721960,5722720," I think it"
5722720,5723180," compiles."
5723180,5723940," I think it,"
5723940,5724280," in fact,"
5724280,5724780," compiles."
5724780,5726420," Hawk"
5726420,5726820," Tui."
5726820,5727820," I swear to"
5727820,5728200," get somebody"
5728200,5728760," actually made"
5728760,5728940," it."
5728940,5729820," I swear to"
5729820,5730260," get somebody"
5730260,5730680," made it."
5730680,5731240," Let me"
5731240,5731440," actually"
5731440,5732020," google it."
5732020,5732540," Hawk"
5732540,5733040," Tui."
5733040,5736700," Yeah, this"
5736700,5737200," is not what I"
5737200,5737360," want."
5737360,5737680," GitHub."
5738200,5742680," No, nobody"
5742680,5743480," done that?"
5743480,5744820," Are you"
5744820,5745340," for real?"
5745340,5745680," Are you"
5745680,5746220," shitting me?"
5746220,5749020," Hawk"
5749020,5749580," GUI."
5749580,5750660," Well, I mean,"
5750660,5751220," somebody made"
5751220,5751820," Hawk GUI."
5751820,5753480," Hawk"
5753480,5754400," Tui."
5754400,5757480," No."
5757480,5758880," But what"
5758880,5759100," about"
5759100,5759680," GUI?"
5759680,5762540," Somebody"
5762540,5762920," done that."
5762920,5763240," But it's"
5763240,5763580," 20..."
5763580,5764020," Okay."
5764020,5765460," Oh, my"
5765460,5765720," God."
5765720,5766320," They didn't"
5766320,5766780," know that."
5766780,5766960," It's"
5766960,5767420," 2021."
5767420,5768580," three years"
5768580,5768880," ago."
5768880,5769400," It's"
5769400,5769820," before the"
5769820,5770000," meme."
5770000,5773360," Free real"
5773360,5773620," estate."
5773620,5773880," Yeah."
5773880,5774420," Why nobody"
5774420,5774800," came up with"
5774800,5775220," that idea?"
5775220,5776520," Strawberry,"
5776520,5777240," you genius."
5777240,5778300," You came up"
5778300,5778920," with a name"
5778920,5779400," that nobody"
5779400,5780020," thought about"
5780020,5780380," before."
5780380,5781540," Holy shit."
5781540,5784200," Yo."
5786900,5787520," You can"
5787520,5788240," capitalize on that."
5788240,5789200," You can capitalize on"
5789200,5789420," that."
5789420,5790080," Especially if you"
5790080,5790660," create a domain"
5790660,5791300," or something."
5791300,5796540," Squad the"
5796540,5797000," repo name"
5797000,5797220," now."
5797220,5797680," Well, I mean,"
5797680,5798840," there's always"
5798840,5799820," namespace in front"
5799820,5800200," of the repo."
5800200,5801700," You probably"
5801700,5802320," want to squad"
5802320,5803980," the organization"

5804320,5804900," Right?"
5804900,5805480," Hawk Tui."
5805480,5808340," It's free."

5956600,5957940," Maybe a"
5957940,5958340," website."
5958340,5959740," And then I"
5959740,5960440," can raise some"

5997800,5998140," Right."
5998140,5998280," So,"
5998280,5998480," I can"
5998480,5998660," do"
5998660,5999020," something"
5999020,5999560," like"
5999560,5999900," this."
5999900,6000420," Right."
6000420,6000560," So,"
6000560,6000820," we can"

6016660,6016820," really"
6016820,6017220," see,"

6030420,6031620," Yeah,"
6031620,6032140," this is"
6032140,6032480," really"
6032480,6033180," weird."
6033180,6034100," It"

6044760,6045920," Look at"
6045920,6046180," that."
6046180,6046960," Why is"
6046960,6047320," it still"

6060380,6063120," Is that"

6063940,6064360," I'm not"

6064580,6065420," Let's"
6065420,6065680," actually"
6065680,6066160," investigate"

6066500,6066720," So,"
6066720,6066840," I'm"
6066840,6066980," going to"

6072120,6072500," I'm"
6072500,6072740," going"
6072740,6073280," to"
6073280,6073760," just"
6073760,6073960," say"
6073960,6074140," how"
6074140,6074320," many"
6074320,6074700," arguments"
6074700,6074900," we"
6074900,6075100," have."
6075100,6075320," So,"
6075320,6075520," in"
6075520,6075720," the"
6075720,6075940," foo"
6075940,6076200," I'm"

6079660,6080880," And"
6080880,6081120," there's"
6081120,6081760," three of"

6082040,6082580," which is"
6082580,6083100," understandable."
6083100,6083700," So,"
6083700,6084080," can I"
6084080,6084400," just"

6088920,6089360," So,"
6089360,6090100," okay,"
6090100,6090320," that"
6090320,6090520," makes"

6091780,6092160," I"

6131700,6133120," How do"
6133120,6133380," you spell"
6133380,6133860," excess?"
6133860,6136700," Let me"
6136700,6137440," find"
6137440,6137920," who"
6137920,6138480," prints"
6138480,6138780," this"
6138780,6139100," thing."
6139100,6139960," Who"
6139960,6140600," actually"
6140600,6141000," prints"
6141000,6141260," this"
6141260,6141540," shit?"
6142060,6142500," It is"
6142500,6142960," printed"
6142960,6146280," in here."
6146280,6146960," It says"
6146960,6147340," that"
6147340,6148780," excess"
6148780,6149500," arguments"
6149500,6150200," so when"
6150200,6150820," max"
6150820,6151960," is greater"
6151960,6152400," than 0"
6152400,6152780," and the"
6152780,6153020," amount"
6153020,6153820," of arguments"
6153820,6154700," is"
6154700,6155440," greater"
6155440,6156020," than the"
6156020,6156460," max"
6156460,6157220," but that"
6157220,6157560," is not"
6157560,6157920," true."
6157920,6160160," Right."
6160160,6160540," So,"
6160540,6161080," we said"
6161080,6161340," that the"
6161340,6161640," max"
6161640,6162180," minimum"
6162180,6162800," is 3"
6162800,6163040," and"
6163040,6163560," maximum"
6163560,6164160," is 3."
6164160,6164860," That's"
6164860,6165160," what we"
6165160,6165380," said"
6165380,6165840," in here."
6165840,6169240," So,"
6169240,6170320," I'm"
6170320,6171700," hella"
6171700,6172260," confused"

6172740,6174560," I'm"
6174560,6174860," hella"
6174860,6175380," confused."
6175380,6177420," Is that"
6177420,6177900," because"
6177900,6179220," it's"
6179220,6179480," actually"
6179480,6180140," four of"
6180140,6180440," them?"
6180440,6184900," So,"
6184900,6186760," dollar"
6186760,6188680," let me"
6188680,6189320," let me"
6189320,6189600," I'm"
6189600,6190520," a bit"
6190520,6191120," sussing"
6191120,6191620," right now"

6192060,6192720," I'm a bit"
6192720,6193280," sussing."
6194280,6194940," can"
6194940,6195180," I"
6195180,6195780," just"
6195780,6198140," print"
6198140,6200360," something"
6200360,6200720," like"
6200720,6201200," this"
6201200,6202860," because"
6202860,6203000," I"
6203000,6203140," need"
6203140,6203300," to"
6203300,6203640," know."
6203640,6205440," So,"
6205440,6205580," this"
6205580,6205760," is going"

6219640,6219940," have"
6219940,6220100," a"

6220600,6221140," that"
6221140,6221480," this"
6221480,6222000," motherfucker"
6222000,6222720," actually"
6222720,6223840," gives me"
6223840,6224180," four"
6224180,6224460," and the"
6224460,6224640," first"
6224640,6224960," argument"
6224960,6225280," is"

6227420,6227720," like"
6227720,6227960," that."
6227960,6229540," So,"
6229540,6230260," let's"
6230260,6230580," do"
6230580,6231440," 17"
6231440,6232060," and"
6232060,6233840," let's"
6233840,6233980," go."
6233980,6235620," It is"
6235620,6235820," four."
6235820,6236240," I"
6236240,6236560," actually"
6236560,6237000," saw that."
6237000,6237660," It is"
6237660,6237840," fucking"
6237840,6238100," four."
6238100,6238580," Why is"
6238580,6238680," it"
6238680,6238860," four?"
6238860,6239620," Can"
6239620,6239800," anybody"
6239800,6240140," tell me"
6240140,6240380," why is"
6240380,6240460," it"
6240460,6240620," four?"
6240620,6243880," So,"
6243880,6244180," even"
6244180,6244640," though"
6244640,6245580," yeah,"
6245580,6247220," I suppose"
6247220,6247580," it's an"
6247580,6248100," extra one"
6248100,6248540," but then"
6248540,6249480," when I'm"
6249480,6249860," doing"
6249860,6250440," this"

6250960,6251400," thing"

6258320,6258860," zero"
6258860,6259100," all"
6259100,6259280," the"
6259280,6259500," name"
6259500,6259640," of"
6259640,6259760," the"
6259760,6260040," macro"
6260040,6260360," itself."
6260360,6260520," I"
6260520,6260720," think"
6260720,6261000," it is"
6261000,6261160," the"
6261160,6261340," name"
6261340,6261460," of"

6261560,6261820," macro"
6261820,6262140," itself."
6262140,6262320," We"
6262320,6262480," can"
6262480,6262680," try"
6262680,6262840," to"
6262840,6263260," confirm"
6263260,6263680," that."
6263680,6265260," Right,"
6265260,6265540," so let's"
6265540,6265720," put"
6265720,6266140," s in"
6266140,6266380," here"
6266380,6266600," and"
6266600,6266680," the"
6266680,6266780," way"
6266780,6266920," we"
6266920,6267220," get"
6267220,6267460," that"
6267460,6267740," is"
6267740,6268180," arg"
6268180,6268920," zero"
6268920,6269140," I"
6269140,6269360," suppose"
6269360,6269660," because"
6269660,6270060," arg"
6270060,6270640," returns"
6270640,6270820," you"
6270820,6271080," this"
6271080,6271320," thing"
6271320,6271500," as"
6271500,6271640," a"
6271640,6271960," string."
6271960,6272820," Yeah,"
6272820,6272960," it"
6272960,6273100," is"
6273100,6273260," then"
6273260,6273540," okay."
6274580,6274980," I"
6274980,6275380," suppose"
6275380,6275700," what"
6275700,6275840," we"
6275840,6276060," have"
6276060,6276200," to"
6276200,6276460," do"
6276460,6277040," is"
6277040,6277360," 4"
6277360,6277720," 4"
6277720,6278260," and"
6278260,6278460," only"
6278460,6278880," then"
6278880,6279200," it's"
6279200,6279420," going"
6279420,6279620," to"
6279620,6279760," do"
6279760,6279880," the"
6279880,6280060," right"
6280060,6280320," thing."
6280320,6281180," Okay,"
6281180,6281980," so that's"
6281980,6282260," how we"
6282260,6282440," learn"
6282440,6282800," things,"
6282800,6283500," I suppose."
6283500,6283820," Do we"
6283820,6283960," have"
6283960,6284260," title?"
6284260,6285740," Yeah,"
6285740,6286160," we don't"
6286160,6286680," really have"
6286680,6287000," title."
6287000,6287980," And the"
6287980,6288640," annoying"
6288640,6289380," thing here"
6289380,6289980," is that"
6289980,6290560," it is"
6290560,6290840," still"
6290840,6291600," 800x600"
6291600,6291760," kind of"
6291760,6292060," and"
6292060,6292320," this"
6292320,6292480," is"
6292480,6292960," because"
6292960,6294120," we"
6294120,6294300," don't"
6294300,6294480," really"
6294480,6294700," use"
6294700,6294840," any"
6294840,6294960," of"
6294960,6295120," that"
6295120,6295420," shit"
6295420,6295900," width"
6295900,6297020," height."
6297020,6297740," Let's"
6297740,6298040," try to"
6298040,6298420," recompile"
6298420,6298580," this"
6298580,6298700," and"
6298700,6298840," I"
6298840,6299040," think"
6299040,6300040," and"
6300040,6300640," if"
6300640,6300720," we"
6300720,6300860," take"
6300860,6300960," a"
6300960,6301060," look"
6301060,6301180," at"
6301180,6301380," that"
6301380,6301640," so"
6301640,6301900," it"
6301900,6302060," is"
6302060,6302520," using"
6302520,6303080," the"
6303080,6303740," screen"
6303740,6304160," resolution"
6304160,6304420," that"
6304420,6304580," we"
6304580,6305180," passed"
6305180,6306020," through"
6306020,6306520," this"

6307340,6307560," mom."
6307560,6308200," Right,"
6308200,6308600," so I"
6308600,6308720," can"
6308720,6308940," put"
6308940,6309320," 4"
6309320,6310580," 3"
6310580,6311180," in"
6311180,6311780," M4"
6311780,6312200," by the"
6312200,6312420," way"
6312420,6313320," and"
6313320,6313620," it"
6313620,6313800," is"
6313800,6314220," actually"
6314220,6314640," passing"
6314640,6314920," that"
6314920,6315280," stuff"
6315280,6315580," in"

6315800,6316400," Look"
6316400,6316500," at"
6316500,6316680," that."
6316680,6317140," Look"
6321600,6323520," so"
6323520,6323680," we"
6323680,6323860," need"
6323860,6324200," to"
6324200,6324540," I"
6324540,6325060," think"
6325060,6326040," sustain"
6326040,6326680," the"
6326680,6327000," loop"
6327000,6327600," somehow"
6327600,6328560," right"
6328560,6328800," so"
6328800,6328980," we"
6328980,6329140," need"
6329140,6329240," to"

6330160,6330400," the"
6330400,6330600," loop"
6330600,6330980," somehow"
6330980,6332300," um"
6332300,6333780," yeah"
6333780,6334440," let's"
6334440,6334860," let's"
6334860,6335060," see"
6335060,6335420," let's"
6335420,6335680," see"
6335680,6337640," how"
6337640,6337900," we're"
6337900,6337960," going"
6337960,6338180," to be"
6338180,6338740," approaching"
6338740,6339140," this"
6339140,6340140," so"
6340140,6342440," the"
6342440,6342620," thing"
6342620,6342760," we"
6342760,6342900," need"
6342900,6343000," to"
6343000,6343200," do"
6343200,6343880," window"
6343880,6344960," window"
6344960,6345540," should"
6345540,6346120," close"

7095880,7096680," it's red now"
7096680,7098240," okay"
7098240,7099480," so"
7099480,7100140," and"
7100140,7101420," your mom"
7101420,7102380," I can go"
7102380,7102880," now"
7102880,7104860," this is m4 script"
7104860,7105800," so what about"
7105800,7106800," some green"
7106800,7110820," what about"
7110820,7111260," it's green"
7111260,7111560," now"
7111560,7115000," that's pretty cool"
7115000,7115860," that is actually"
7115860,7116840," pretty fucking cool"
7116840,7117760," so yeah"
7117760,7119900," I did a"
7119900,7120820," ray leap speed run"
7120820,7121800," in m4"
7121800,7128660," can"
7128660,7128660," can"
7128660,7129120," your"
7129120,7129700," rust"
7129700,7130600," do that"
7130600,7131220," can"
7131220,7131660," your"
7131660,7132160," rust"
7132160,7132880," do that"
7132880,7133380," it actually"
7133380,7134040," technically can"
7134040,7135180," but it's a little bit more difficult"
7135180,7136300," so anyway"
7136300,7137900," that's just to prove my point"
7137900,7138900," that if you"
7138900,7139960," have a piece of c"
7139960,7141220," a piece of code"
7141220,7142040," in c"
7142040,7143660," it works"
7143660,7145420," everywhere"
7145420,7147740," not everywhere"
7147740,7148660," there's a browser"
7148660,7149240," not everywhere"
7149240,7149920," there's something"
7149920,7152140," it works"
7152140,7153320," everywhere"
7153320,7154860," it is"
7154860,7156400," the programming language"
7156400,7157900," of planet earth"
7157900,7159400," humanity"
7159400,7160680," presents"
7160680,7161280," in c"
7161280,7166200," this is what it is"
7166200,7166820," m4"
7166820,7167300," yeah"
7167300,7167960," we need to actually"
7167960,7168220," maybe"
7168220,7170200," release that"
7170200,7171620," as a separate build"
7171620,7172460," of m4"
7172460,7172880," with"
7172880,7176620," like the fact"
7176620,7177460," that it doesn't"
7177460,7178200," stack overflow"
7178200,7179340," is fucking amazing"
7179340,7179960," so that means"
7179960,7180200," the"
7180200,7182320," that means"
7182320,7183000," the system"
7183000,7183680," that m4"
7183680,7184260," the engine"
7184260,7185060," of m4"
7185060,7185860," doesn't really"
7185860,7186860," use the stack"
7186860,7187780," when it does"
7187780,7188460," the recursion"
7188460,7189360," I suppose"
7189360,7189740," it just"
7189740,7190700," expands"
7190700,7192360," a little bit"
7192360,7193240," then tries"
7193240,7193940," to expand"
7193940,7194460," again"
7194460,7195080," and again"
7195080,7195540," and again"
7195540,7196000," and it's just"
7196000,7196340," like it"
7196340,7197100," turns into"
7197100,7197560," this like"
7197560,7198440," you know"
7198440,7199300," lazy stream"
7199300,7199880," of things"
7199880,7200300," right"
7200300,7200780," it's a lazy"
7200780,7201660," stream of characters"
7201660,7202380," that's what it is"
7202380,7202860," I suppose"
7202860,7203720," and if you make"
7203720,7204160," your loop"
7204160,7205320," not produce"
7205320,7206120," any output"
7206120,7207400," it just works"
7207400,7207800," right"
7207800,7208840," it just sustains"
7208840,7209500," this loop"
7209500,7210880," and it's fine"
7210880,7211140," right"
7211140,7211540," as you can see"
7211540,7212140," it's sustaining"
7212140,7212760," it's just like"
7212760,7214060," not blowing out"
7214060,7215760," or is the memory"
7215760,7217040," even growing right now"
7217040,7218100," this is an interesting"
7218100,7218420," question"
7218420,7219080," so if I do"
7219080,7220740," btop"
7220740,7221640," it's actually"
7221640,7222420," too small"
7222420,7223280," right"
7223280,7224020," so what's about"
7224020,7224500," the memory"
7224500,7226480," where is the memory"
7226480,7226700," though"
7226700,7227480," I don't see the memory"
7227480,7229600," so here's the memory"
7229600,7230980," used memory"
7230980,7231720," right now"
7231720,7232540," 3 gigs"
7232540,7233660," but I'm actually"
7233660,7234000," not sure"
7234000,7234500," so what about"
7234500,7234920," htop"
7234920,7235500," let's do"
7235500,7235900," htop"
7235900,7237180," okay"
7237180,7238920," the memory"
7238920,7239380," is not even"
7239380,7239700," growing"
7239700,7241180," so it is"
7241180,7242220," looping right now"
7242220,7243260," through recursion"
7243260,7243540," right"
7243540,7244060," so this thing"
7244060,7244620," is looping"
7244620,7245220," through recursion"
7245220,7245620," right now"
7245620,7246840," and it's not"
7246840,7247700," growing any memory"
7247700,7249520," so this is actually"
7249520,7250440," a pretty cool engine"
7250440,7251540," right"
7251540,7252220," so that means"
7252220,7252720," it is"
7252720,7253720," basically works"
7253720,7254720," as a lazy stream"
7254720,7255320," of characters"
7255320,7256120," and since"
7256120,7256800," our loop"
7256800,7257640," does not"
7257640,7259260," produce any characters"
7259260,7260580," yeah"
7260580,7261220," it essentially"
7261220,7261940," just works"
7261940,7262940," it starts to"
7262940,7263900," busy loop a little bit"
7263900,7265500," it's busy looping"
7265500,7265920," a little bit"
7265920,7266640," but this is because"
7266640,7267400," we didn't set"
7267400,7268100," any FPS"
7268100,7268540," right"
7268540,7269160," so we can actually"
7269160,7269440," add"
7269440,7270440," you know"
7270440,7271920," function binding"
7271920,7273080," to set FPS"
7273080,7274680," but yeah"
7274680,7277420," I thought only"
7277420,7278200," functional language"
7278200,7278980," had a tail call"
7278980,7279560," optimization"
7279560,7280680," I'm not sure"
7280680,7281720," if it's explicitly"
7281720,7282720," tail call optimization"
7282720,7283320," I think"
7283320,7283320," I think"
7283320,7283700," it's just"
7283700,7284240," a side effect"
7284240,7284640," of how"
7284640,7285300," M4 engine"
7285300,7285680," works"
7285680,7287020," right"
7287020,7287360," so because"
7287360,7288160," M4 engine"
7288160,7289240," has this"
7289240,7290280," ob stack"
7290280,7291200," thingy"
7291200,7291880," which I don't"
7291880,7292240," really know"
7292240,7292780," what it is"
7292780,7293020," right"
7293020,7293320," so"
7293320,7294840," the function"
7294840,7295520," so here's"
7295520,7295980," the binding"
7295980,7296520," and it has"
7296520,7297420," this ob stack"
7297420,7298760," and when you"
7298760,7300680," printing something"
7300680,7301720," into the output"
7301720,7302700," you actually"
7302700,7303940," are shipping"
7303940,7305020," out characters"
7305020,7305680," into that"
7305680,7306580," ob stack"
7306580,7307620," right"
7307620,7308280," you actually"
7308280,7309060," shipping it"
7309060,7309280," there"
7309280,7310060," so I can't"
7310060,7310260," really"
7310260,7311600," find the"
7311600,7312000," definition"
7312000,7312580," of this"
7312580,7312780," thing"
7312780,7313280," very easily"
7313280,7313620," so let's"
7313620,7314240," actually grab it"
7314240,7315260," so let me see"
7315260,7315980," what the fuck"
7315980,7316520," is that"
7316520,7317780," so"
7317780,7318380," stack"
7318380,7319380," ob stack"
7319380,7321080," where's the"
7321080,7321520," definition"
7321520,7322180," can you just"
7322180,7322700," give me the"
7322700,7323180," definition"
7323180,7324380," oh fuck you"
7324380,7326160," can I have"
7326160,7328960," bro"
7328960,7330640," even tags"
7330640,7331400," doesn't tell me"
7331400,7332160," where it is"
7332160,7333840," where is it"
7333840,7334160," defined"
7334160,7334660," can anybody"
7334660,7335280," tell me"
7335280,7336460," so"
7336460,7338260," is it"
7338260,7340920," probably have"
7340920,7341320," to manually"
7341320,7341800," look for"
7341800,7341980," the"
7341980,7343920," extern"
7343920,7345140," ob stack"
7345140,7345900," extract"
7345900,7346660," ob stack"
7346660,7347200," okay so"
7347200,7347700," there is"
7347700,7350200," static"
7350200,7350760," stack"
7350760,7351460," ob stack"
7351460,7353720," we can try"
7353720,7354120," to do"
7354120,7354760," something like"
7354760,7355240," that"
7355240,7355780," sure"
7355780,7356800," okay thank"
7356800,7356960," you"
7356960,7357440," but there's"
7357440,7358900," where is the"
7358900,7359320," definition"
7359320,7359760," for this"
7359760,7360200," fucker"
7360200,7363700," okay"
7363700,7364800," oh finally"
7364800,7365520," Jesus Christ"
7365520,7365940," okay thank"
7365940,7366060," you"
7366060,7366360," thank you"
7366360,7366660," so much"
7366660,7368020," okay"
7368020,7369140," so"
7369140,7369500," control"
7369500,7369840," current"
7369840,7370220," object"
7370220,7370460," in"
7370460,7370820," current"
7370820,7371500," chunk"
7371500,7373320," preferred"
7373320,7374060," size"
7374060,7376080," so"
7376080,7376620," it even"
7376620,7377060," uses"
7377060,7377520," some sort"
7377520,7378180," of chunks"
7378180,7379540," and chunk"
7379540,7380300," functions"
7380300,7381300," damn"
7381300,7382700," some advanced"
7382700,7383080," fucking"
7383080,7383540," system"
7383540,7384080," so"
7384080,7384560," ob stack"
7384560,7385080," dot h"
7385080,7385800," sorry"
7385800,7386660," all the"
7386660,7387180," apparent"
7387180,7387680," functions"
7387680,7388260," defined here"
7388260,7388680," are macros"
7388680,7389100," the idea"
7389100,7389440," is that"
7389440,7389880," you would"
7389880,7390280," use"
7390280,7390480," the"
7390480,7390980," pretested"
7390980,7391260," okay"
7391260,7391480," so"
7391480,7391760," this is"
7391760,7391880," not"
7391880,7392100," interesting"
7392100,7392300," I'm"
7392300,7392980," more interested"
7392980,7393540," in what"
7393540,7393960," the fuck"
7393960,7394140," is"
7394140,7394860," ob stack"
7394860,7397240," okay"
7397240,7397840," they don't"
7397840,7398460," really explain"
7398460,7398760," what is"
7398760,7399180," ob stack"
7399180,7399760," but I suppose"
7399760,7400380," this is sort"
7400380,7400620," of like"
7400620,7401120," the core"
7401120,7401520," of their"
7401520,7401980," engine"
7401980,7402980," right"
7402980,7403440," so it"
7403440,7403840," does"
7403840,7404300," all of"
7404300,7404500," this"
7404500,7405060," magic"
7405060,7406960," it does"
7406960,7407320," all of"
7407320,7407440," this"
7407440,7407800," magic"
7407800,7408160," which is"
7408160,7408400," kind of"
7408400,7408600," cool"
7408600,7410140," all right"
7410140,7410520," so"
7410520,7411440," thank you"
7411440,7411700," so much"
7411700,7411980," everyone"
7411980,7412220," who"
7412220,7412720," subscribed"
7412720,7416020," felix"

7428460,7429400," thank you"
7429400,7430100," okay"
7430100,7430500," good"
7430500,7431340," so"
7431340,7431900," yeah"
7431900,7432280," today was"
7432280,7432520," a pretty"
7432520,7432680," cool"
7432680,7432940," stream"
7432940,7433780," so"
7433780,7434420," we"
7434420,7435160," created"
7435160,7435780," bindings"
7435780,7436000," for"
7436000,7436520," m4"
7436520,7437000," out of"
7437000,7437240," all"
7437240,7437640," things"
7437640,7438980," I think"
7438980,7439160," that's"
7439160,7439320," pretty"
7439320,7439600," cool"
7439600,7440900," honestly"
7440900,7441320," like"
7441320,7442080," I knew"
7442080,7443340," that it's"
7443340,7443820," relatively"
7443820,7444340," easy"
7444340,7445140," to add"
7445140,7445680," bindings"
7445680,7446120," in here"
7446120,7447400," but I"
7447400,7448040," was kind"
7448040,7448740," of doubtful"
7448740,7449540," that I"
7449540,7449960," will be able"
7449960,7450500," to create"
7450500,7451380," a sustainable"
7451380,7452080," loop"
7452080,7453520," I was thinking"
7453520,7454560," that either"
7454560,7455160," I'm going"
7455160,7455600," to have"
7455600,7456120," problems"
7456120,7456580," with"
7456580,7457780," you know"
7457780,7458220," stack"
7458220,7458580," overflow"
7458580,7459240," right"
7459240,7459740," so and"
7459740,7460080," it won't"
7460080,7460500," be possible"
7460500,7460820," to have"
7460820,7461220," a sustainable"
7461220,7461580," loop"
7461580,7462180," or it's"
7462180,7462620," going to"
7462620,7463020," actually"
7463020,7463820," just consume"
7463820,7464300," all of"
7464300,7464660," the memory"
7464660,7465060," because it"
7465060,7465340," creates"
7465340,7465740," like a"
7465740,7466820," allocates"
7466820,7467220," too much"
7467220,7467780," memory"
7467780,7468120," for the"
7468120,7468460," output"
7468460,7469100," or something"
7469100,7469460," like I"
7469460,7470300," was expecting"
7470300,7470900," something like"
7470900,7471340," that but I"
7471340,7472020," didn't expect"
7472020,7472600," that it would"
7472600,7473660," just work"
7473660,7475240," it is actually"
7475240,7476000," kind of insane"
7476000,7476460," that this"
7476460,7476820," motherfucker"
7476820,7477820," just works"
7477820,7479720," so I"
7479720,7480660," honestly didn't"
7480660,7481220," expect that"
7481220,7481700," I expected"
7481700,7482160," like a"
7482160,7482600," literal"
7482600,7483180," shed show"
7483180,7484260," we had a"
7484260,7484560," little bit"
7484560,7484780," of a"
7484780,7485200," shed show"
7485200,7485640," with the"
7485640,7486000," building"
7486000,7486580," system"
7486580,7487300," out of"
7487300,7487820," all things"
7487820,7489440," which is"
7489440,7490000," actually good"
7490000,7490440," proof that"
7490440,7491080," build systems"
7491080,7491760," today for"
7491760,7492320," C and C++"
7492320,7493040," are completely"
7493040,7493560," fucked"
7493560,7494300," right"
7494300,7494920," they're completely"
7494920,7495480," fucked because"
7495480,7496080," that's the only"
7496080,7496640," point of"
7496640,7497640," failure that"
7497640,7497960," we had"
7497960,7498420," on today's"
7498420,7498740," streams"
7498740,7499460," right"
7499460,7500220," the only"
7500220,7500700," point of"
7500700,7500920," failure"
7500920,7501480," everything else"
7501480,7502000," was smooth"
7502000,7502700," except the"
7502700,7503280," fucking build"
7503280,7503740," systems"
7503740,7504560," telling you"
7504560,7505160," literal"
7505160,7506360," mechanisms"
7506360,7506960," for job"
7506960,7507420," security"
7507420,7509100," build systems"
7509100,7509780," were created"
7509780,7510740," literally for job"
7510740,7511080," security"
7511080,7511560," nothing else"
7511560,7512040," they don't solve"
7512040,7512460," any problems"
7512460,7513240," they create"
7513240,7513700," problems"
7513700,7514600," so they"
7514600,7515340," don't fire"
7515340,7515680," you"
7515680,7517140," anyways"
7517140,7517760," right"
7517760,7518240," so I'm"
7518240,7519120," really surprised"
7519120,7519780," that we managed"
7519780,7520280," to create a"
7520280,7521000," sustainable loop"
7521000,7521620," and it just"
7521620,7522020," works"
7522020,7522280," it's"
7522280,7522880," fucking"
7522880,7523280," amazing"
7523280,7523620," I'm telling"
7523620,7523800," you"
7523800,7523980," bro"
7523980,7525300," right"
7525300,7526220," so it's"
7526220,7526620," so fucking"
7526620,7526840," cool"
7526840,7527200," so here"
7527200,7527460," we go"
7527460,7527980," so a little"
7527980,7528460," little blue"
7528460,7529560," I can control"
7529560,7530620," exactly what"
7530620,7531160," kind of color"
7531160,7531600," I can have"
7531600,7531940," in here"
7531940,7532760," I can probably"
7532760,7533420," write a little"
7533420,7534000," bit of a logic"
7534000,7534420," so"
7534420,7536740," these things"
7536740,7537360," supports"
7537360,7538720," numeric values"
7538720,7539880," right"
7539880,7540420," so that means"
7540420,7541040," I can have"
7541040,7541420," some sort"
7541420,7541980," of a state"
7541980,7542720," like we can"
7542720,7543060," do some"
7543060,7543420," interesting"
7543420,7543780," thing"
7543780,7544160," with this"
7544160,7544460," stuff"
7544460,7544860," we can"
7544860,7545180," do some"
7545180,7545500," interesting"
7545500,7545880," thing"
7545880,7546760," but I think"
7546760,7547040," it's too"
7547040,7547340," much"
7547340,7547660," right"
7547660,7547960," I think"
7547960,7548260," it's too"
7548260,7548600," much"
7548600,7552080," this is"
7552080,7552400," you can"
7552400,7553100," write code"
7553100,7553800," despite all"
7553800,7554220," the bullshit"
7554220,7554740," around him"
7554740,7555400," that's kind"
7555400,7555920," of the point"
7555920,7557100," of a professional"
7557100,7557880," software developer"
7557880,7558300," honestly"
7558300,7559500," any"
7559500,7561060," person who"
7561060,7561640," works as a"
7561640,7562360," professional software"
7562360,7562820," developer"
7562820,7563760," it's their"
7563760,7564240," job"
7564240,7565140," to get"
7565140,7565480," the shit"
7565480,7565840," done"
7565840,7566680," despite all"
7566680,7567140," the bullshit"
7567140,7568560," it's just"
7568560,7569360," like constant"
7569360,7570100," fighting through"
7570100,7570520," the bullshit"
7570520,7571220," and this is"
7571220,7571700," why we're"
7571700,7572280," paid so"
7572280,7572620," much"
7572620,7573580," this is"
7573580,7573800," literally"
7573800,7574140," the reason"
7574140,7574460," we paid"
7574460,7574760," so much"
7574760,7575040," because"
7575040,7575500," nobody"
7575500,7576620," except us"
7576620,7578380," wants to"
7578380,7578840," do that"
7578840,7579400," because it's"
7579400,7579860," unpleasant"
7579860,7581160," as a senior"
7581160,7581540," front end"
7581540,7582080," I can confirm"
7582080,7582340," yeah"
7582340,7583600," you just have"
7583600,7583920," to learn"
7583920,7584340," to live"
7584340,7584620," with it"
7584620,7584800," yeah"
7584800,7585180," exactly"
7585180,7586400," it's just"
7586400,7586860," like you"
7586860,7587200," you can"
7587200,7587660," be mad"
7587660,7588000," at it"
7588000,7588940," but at the"
7588940,7589280," end of the"
7589280,7589460," day"
7589460,7589860," it's just"
7589860,7590240," it is"
7590240,7590560," what it"
7590560,7590740," is"
7590740,7591040," there's"
7591040,7591240," nothing"
7591240,7591500," much"
7591500,7591720," you can"
7591720,7591880," do"
7591880,7592360," about it"
7592360,7592740," right"
7592740,7593700," kind of"
7593700,7594240," being mad"
7594240,7594580," at it"
7594580,7595160," kind of"
7595160,7595440," helps"
7595440,7595720," a little"
7595720,7595980," bit"
7595980,7596680," right"
7596680,7597180," so just"
7597180,7597660," mentally"
7597660,7598260," to grind"
7598260,7598640," through"
7598640,7600420," but yeah"
7600420,7602160," I just"
7602160,7602520," need to do"
7602520,7603300," that"
7603300,7605040," have a"
7605040,7606220," for build"
7606220,7606820," exactly"
7606820,7607940," exactly"
7607940,7608480," there's just"
7608480,7608700," like"
7608700,7609240," I don't"
7609240,7609480," know"
7609480,7610120," they don't"
7610120,7610420," solve"
7610420,7610780," problems"
7610780,7611400," they only"
7611400,7611900," create"
7611900,7612160," them"
7612160,7613300," they literally"
7613300,7614060," only create"
7614060,7614540," problems"
7614540,7615460," I think"
7615460,7615720," it's some"
7615720,7616000," sort of"
7616000,7616580," like a"
7616580,7617940," fallacy"
7617940,7618820," that they"
7618820,7619320," somehow"
7619320,7619780," make"
7619780,7620240," things"
7620240,7620560," better"
7620560,7624440," so anyway"
7624440,7625720," as far as a"
7625720,7626280," pretty cool stream"
7626280,7627140," I really enjoyed"
7627140,7627340," it"
7627340,7628340," thanks everyone"
7628340,7629300," who's watching"
7629300,7629720," right now"
7629720,7630560," I really"
7630560,7630860," appreciate"
7630860,7631200," it"
7631200,7631840," have a"
7631840,7632220," good one"
7632220,7632520," and I"
7632520,7632800," see you"
7632800,7633260," all on the"
7633260,7633580," next"
7633580,7634240," recreation"
7634240,7634640," programming"
7634640,7635040," session"
7635040,7635600," with"
7635600,7636320," Ahu"
