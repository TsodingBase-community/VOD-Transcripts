720,6800," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session"
6800,15200," with a mr azuzin hello hello welcome hello hello uh right so let's do a little bit of announcement"
15200,22240," uh how do i type forgot how to type uh red circle live on twitch and what are we doing today on"
22240,31200," twitch.at television website today we're uh continue developing uh mutualizer right so i'm"
31200,35360," going to give the link to where we're doing all that twitch.tv/turning and i'm going to ping everyone"
35360,40560," who's interested in being pinged and i go the string has officially started so for those who"
40560,44960," doesn't know mutualizer is a music visualizer that we've been developing for quite some time"
44960,50320," uh i'm gonna copy paste the link here in the chat and for people who's potentially watching on youtube"
50320,55360," i'm going to put that in the description real quick uh right so let me just put it like that"
55360,65280," so this is going to be in the description so um continue mutualizing so and this is references"
65280,71840," so it's a very simple project well i mean the concept of this project is actually very relatively"
71840,77200," simple so let's actually rebuild this entire thing uh right and let's actually go ahead and start it"
78000,82880," so you're basically greeted with a window where you're supposed to drag and drop some music uh so"
82880,90960," let's actually start a file manager and um grab some music shall we so i'm gonna go to my project so this"
90960,100560," is somewhere at coding mutualizer music and um let's go ahead and drag and drop something uh so just one"
100560,106720," single file so this is how it looks like uh right so you can actually uh drag and drop several files so you can"
106720,112880," have several of them as you can see we have a pretty cool ui going on uh and you can have a lot of things"
112880,122000," in here so you can drag and drop multiple files and uh maybe even more so i want to trigger the scroll bar"
122000,128240," right as you can see you have a scroll bar and stuff like that and ui is written completely in c right"
128240,135120," it's completely in c and it doesn't really use any framework so essentially what it does it uh places shapes"
135120,139920," right so if you can say that we're effectively using our own ui library right so you can say it"
139920,145840," like that it depends on the on the perspective right so uh from some people for some people it's going to"
145840,150960," be like we're making our own thing for for other people it's going to be we're just not you not using"
150960,155200," anything it doesn't really matter right at the end of the day what we're doing we're just placing shapes"
155200,161840," on the screen right um so and uh the concept is the following so let's actually take some sort of"
161840,169760," like a small file uh maybe this one right and uh you can turn that into a video right so right now we"
169760,175360," have to press a special key like app and it will start start rendering the video using the ff impact right"
175360,181040," under the hood it's literally using the ff impact uh as you can see it's it's running the ff impact right now"
181040,186560," if you ever worked with ff impact you recognize this output uh right so this is what it uses under"
186560,192560," the hood to sort of encode this entire thing so essentially what it does it just generates the"
192560,199680," frames but it doesn't know how to encode those frames and pack them into a video and it uses ff impact"
199680,205600," specifically for that right it just hands uh ff impact the frames and ff impact eventually just like"
205600,212000," creates a video so that's basically what it does so and then uh the idea is that you take this video"
212000,217040," and maybe you post it somewhere maybe on youtube maybe on twitter on some social media and stuff like"
217040,224160," that i was planning it to be sort of like a tool for music creators to showcase their music right so maybe"
224160,229920," they just made it some sort of like a teaser that they want to post on twitter so and quickly visualize"
229920,235280," something right so because just posting music by itself doesn't really cut it on the modern social media"
235280,241760," right you need to entertain people you need to tickle the balls a little bit so they they click on it so"
241760,248640," just the sounds are not enough you also need to have the visuals right so right now you can only have"
248640,254720," one kind of visuals uh but in the future i actually plan to have a customization uh right so for example"
254720,259760," change the color of the background change the color of the balls themselves that keep tickling while"
259760,268880," you play the music right so visualization inspired by tickling the balls uh right and it's also like"
268880,274560," maybe customize the different parameters of physics in here because you have a little bit of a physic"
274560,280240," going on right so as you can see there's a little bit of a physic like the the smears and stuff like that"
280240,286880," uh and they are controlled by different constants by different parameters maybe we could allow you to"
286880,293200," tweak those as well to achieve certain you know look and feel right so that will be actually kind of"
293200,298880," interesting i think uh right so and the video is already rendered so if we take a look at it so there's"
298880,305680," the output mp4 and i can open it with a vlc and if i open it with vlc it's it's literally video of of that"
305680,312320," visualization right it's it's literally video so it just generated the video so that's basically the idea"
312320,318240," of the project that's basically the idea of the project so in the future we also kind of plan to have um"
318240,325520," recording from a mic so right now it's not fully finished it's sort of like in planning in development we"
325520,330480," we did some some experiments some interesting experiments to gather information on how to better"
330480,336000," organize that but as of right now it just visualizes this thing in a real time right it"
336000,341280," visualizes it in real time but in the future i plan to make it so you can record"
341280,346960," something you can record something and your recording becomes one of the samples in the side"
346960,352000," panel one of the samples in the side panel that you can then render right but i haven't"
352000,357520," decided how exactly i want to do that so there's several ways you can approach that from the ux point"
357520,363600," of view so i'm still thinking about it i'm still thinking about it um right so what we're gonna do"
363600,368880," today i didn't really plan anything particularly specific today i just wanted to work on ui uh right"
368880,374640," there is um a couple of rough things about the ui that i would like to fix up uh specifically what i"
374640,382320," noticed by the way um on reddit i've seen people using this thing on reddit i think somebody posted"
382320,389360," like a screenshot on unix porn uh with the mutualizer and they were just showcasing like this visualization"
389360,397200," and stuff like that and uh so it was like an old version of visualizer i think um right and it was just"
397200,403520," full screen without these side panels and stuff like that so apparently there is a use case for"
403520,410720," mutualizer to just showcase and showcase it on the screen and when you are showcasing things on the"
410720,416160," screen you probably don't want any of the side panels any of these things or anything like that"
416160,422880," so there is a show like a use case for that so i think we need to accommodate for that right just just"
422880,426320," in case people want to do that so what i'm thinking is that maybe i'm going to create some sort"
426320,433520," of a button at the corner in here which you press and it just uh removes all of these things and"
433520,439680," puts it in a full screen you know the full screen button right it just puts it in a full screen and"
439680,445520," uh it works as usual right so uh but without these components and then you can press escape and it goes"
445520,451600," out of the full screen so this is something that i would like to do so another thing that i would like"
451600,457040," to have on the ui before the next alpha 2 release right so we already had one alpha release so we're"
457040,462800," going to have the next one at some point so another one if i would like to have the volume controller right"
462800,467360," because right now you can't control the volume of the song right it's playing at the volume that it's"
467360,472960," playing uh in fact it's playing at the half of the volume and it's literally playing at the half of"
472960,481120," the volume so i think i literally set uh music volume at the half just in case uh right but it would be"
481120,487520," nice to let the user control um you know the volume thing so i would like to also spend some time"
487520,492320," implementing the slider that would allow you to control the volume right i'm not sure if it's going"
492320,498720," to control the volume in the final song i'm not sure if it's that needed but just for the preview"
499280,504720," just for the preview i think it's going to be rather useful um i think it's going to be rather useful so"
504720,512800," and if we have enough time i would like to work maybe on um on some bugs of the ui when the the text"
512800,517840," is cut off but we'll see if we have time for that so maybe implementing these two ui components is going"
517840,527840," to be enough for for an entire stream uh where can i find yesterday's world well it's do you know how to use twitch"
527840,537600," i mean did the twitch developers made it so unintuitive that people can't find previous words anymore"
538160,545440," or or or what i think you go to the cycling channel and there was a tab there previous like streams"
545440,552800," and it's there yeah yeah so this one thank you thank you so much it's a judging video right i don't know"
552800,560160," like twitch makes ui less and less intuitive there is this yeah i i can see why people cannot find it"
560160,565840," sometimes it's just kind of difficult it used to be way simpler i think i think which used to be way"
565840,571280," simpler now these days they're kind of over complicating it for whatever reason maybe this"
571280,577600," is what they saw in their telemetry right so maybe the telemetry told them if you make it convoluted like"
577600,583920," that people spend more time on the website or something i don't know which kind of makes sense"
583920,589440," you make the ui convoluted people don't know how to exit your website they spend more time on your"
589440,592640," website we improved the metric guys we improved"
592640,606720," confusion equals retention exactly confuse them to retain their attention this is genius i love that"
606720,611120," oh yeah engagement vim style yeah exactly"
612080,619280," uh this is so fucking funny yeah because now they spend more time to find the vod right they used to"
619280,624880," actually find it very quickly but now they spend more time finding the vote and that improves the retention"
624880,626000," holy"
626000,633760," this could be unironically the reason why it becomes more and more complicated"
633760,645040," oh yeah it's the same in supermarket yeah exactly i heard something like that so you don't buy anything"
645040,653280," good good good luck getting back so yeah i remember um so hearing somewhere that the supermarkets actually"
653280,659760," collect statistics of what people buy or what goods what the products people buy together"
659760,664560," more often and they put them on the opposite side of the supermarket"
664560,670320," just fucking intentionally to force you to go from one thing to another thing and watch as many"
670320,676480," things as as like you physically can they they do that that's one of the dark patterns that they actually"
676480,682880," do this is insane and apparently that works right because that kind of subconsciously forces you"
682880,690080," forces you to look at more product and potentially buy more products uh so that that is that is a thing"
690080,690640," apparently"
694320,699280," ikea is the best example yeah it is actually so it it forces you to go through the entire"
699280,709600," place uh so okay let's go ahead and add lebaton lebaton uh but maybe maybe lebaton is not the first"
709600,715440," thing that we want to add we want to add mechanism that allows you to go full screen and back right and"
715440,721600," that mechanism is probably called boolean right so you want to have a boolean variable uh right so let's"
721600,728480," actually create a boolean and uh so here is the renderer okay so here is everything related to the"
728480,737120," visualizer itself right so let's introduce another boolean in here right so uh we are using like a state"
737120,748080," framework that is called a c structure a global c structure uh so a full screen uh so this is full screen"
748080,753120," okay so eventually as you can see i'm kind of separating these fields by their functionality"
753120,759120," which kind of implies that those things should be themselves uh separate entities separate"
759120,764720," structures and this is where it's all going right so this is where it's all eventually going"
764720,769440," but we're not really there yet uh we're not really there yet but i'm sort of preparing to sort"
769440,773600," of like take this thing and strip them off and put them as separate structures and stuff like"
773600,780960," that the separate components uh okay so we have a full screen so where do we render this syntactic"
780960,787840," so there's a plugin update there's a plugin update so are we in a rendering phase basically ffm pack"
787840,793760," rendering so here we're not uh then we're asking are we in a capturing state capturing state is when we"
793760,799840," capture stuff for the microphone so we're not in the capturing state so here do we expect any dropped files we"
799840,807440," don't expect any dropped files so here we are handling the the press key and stuff like that and there you go"
807440,813680," here we asking the question are we currently playing any track is there any currently a track"
813680,820480," so i think it doesn't really matter um right i well i mean i think it does matter right so because when you"
820480,826240," currently don't have any track you're supposed to show drag and drop music here that's what you're supposed to show"
827040,833200," all right so that means the place that we are the most interested in is when the track is available"
833200,840400," right and uh we handled all of these things in here and this is where we are rendering everything so as"
840400,846560," you can see here is the preview right so here's the preview uh then we are rendering the preview so then"
846560,852960," we're rendering track panel and the timeline so the track panel is the one on the left and the timeline is"
852960,858640," the one at the bottom where you can control where the currently cursor is playing so i suppose this"
858640,864880," is where we're gonna have uh a check for the full screen right so are we currently in the full screen"
864880,871360," right so are we currently in the full screen if we're not we're doing the usual thing uh the usual"
871360,877200," rendering with the left panel and the bottom timeline right so let's actually do this sort of separation"
878160,884800," so this is probably where we want to do all of this stuff and um essentially one of the things i want"
884800,894000," to do i want to add some sort of a control uh to turn this into full screen so this one is interesting"
894000,903360," so we use space to pause and pause the music that is fine we use q to um restart the music to the beginning i"
903360,909200," feel like this is not needed anymore because we got a timeline right so this stuff was needed when we"
909200,916640," didn't have a timeline so it was difficult to restart so i had like this special key so i think allocating"
916640,926000," q for that is kind of redundant um right so we also have f and f is um rendering the um the final video"
926800,933920," i would like to do full screen on f but it's already taken i can basically turn it like so"
933920,940480," so q is going to be rendering and then f is full screen toggle full screen but unfortunately we"
940480,948000," already released this like that so it's going to be extremely confusing uh it's going to be extremely"
948000,954400," confusing so uh people are suggesting uh people are suggesting to use r as a rendering and f as full"
954400,961520," screen i really like that so unfortunately r is already taken for a higher level feature for a"
961520,972080," higher level feature uh to hot reload the the whole thing but luckily luckily this feature is a development"
972080,981440," feature and it's not released to the end user so it's our own development feature so that means we can"
982720,989840," maybe do something else right so maybe we can do f5 right so do we even have f5 for this kind of stuff"
989840,999280," so i wonder if we do so we can do f5 in here and then we can say uh r is rendering and uh f is going to be"
999280,1010800," f is going to be toggle the full screen right uh toggle the full screen so yes yes yes yes so uh not"
1011520,1017200," full screen something like this i'm gonna actually bring this thing a little bit closer to where we"
1017200,1026880," actually check uh for the full screen uh and inside of the full screen i think we can simply uh do the"
1026880,1032320," rendering so here is the thing so we render the preview in here so this is the preview but before"
1032320,1040240," we can render the preview we have to do effective analyzation analysis not analyzation is that even"
1040240,1044880," a word in english language i don't know i don't speak english i'm really sorry so uh so we need to"
1044880,1051280," do fft analysis and what's funny is that we always need to do it anyway so we might as well actually move"
1051280,1058240," this fft analysis uh like outside of the decision full screen or not full screen because we're gonna do that"
1058240,1064480," anyway so who cares uh right so in here we're doing the rendering so okay so preview boundary"
1064480,1071680," so in a full screen we're going to have our own preview boundary uh but it's not going to include"
1071680,1078160," the tracks panel or anything like that so it's rendered at the zero zero with the full width and"
1078160,1085520," height right just the full width and height and then uh what we do in here we're just doing fft render of"
1085520,1091600," this entire thing so actually full screen is way easier than uh the rest of the panels right it's"
1091600,1097600," it's way easier and that should be it that should be the entirety of the thing so let me take a look"
1097600,1102880," at the configuration of the build right so here we have enabled hot reloading okay so that's cool"
1102880,1108160," and i'm going to rebuild this entire stuff so hot reloading is enabled okay that's cool"
1108880,1116720," so let's get us started and uh let's put some music in here and let's stop and i'm going to press f"
1116720,1127120," we're in full screen i press f again we're back can your react do that so god damn easily just a single"
1127120,1138000," boolean and you're in it already have full screen"
1138000,1149200," so just for the record i do understand that comparing whatever i do with web development it's stupid"
1149760,1157280," it is in fact stupid but that makes it even funnier when a random web dev that just stumbled upon our"
1157280,1163920," stream take all this seriously that makes it even funnier i know that comparing this kind of stuff is"
1163920,1169600," dumb that is intentional i'm a trained professional i know how to deal with this kind of people on the"
1169600,1190320," internet can you compile c with webpack i think you can uh so does webpack has plugin systems"
1190320,1197760," right so if it has a plugin system there's probably some sort of plugin that compiles c to um web assembly"
1197760,1202320," and once you have a web assembly you can probably pack web assembly into the bundle"
1202320,1208800," so bundle is essentially just like a tangled mess of javascript right it's a single file with a tangled"
1208800,1216160," mess of javascript so how can you entangle web assembly into that tangled mess you can convert a web"
1216160,1225680," assembly module into like byte array right i think i've already done that before right so essentially you"
1225680,1231600," can turn it into byte array incorporate into the javascript that then takes this array and instantiates"
1231600,1236960," the the web assembly module and there you go you have uh web assembly as part of the bundle"
1236960,1247520," right so i think the answer is unironically yes you can compile c with webpack like unironically i think you"
1247520,1253600," can uh you can use base64 right sure it doesn't really matter how exactly you store the web assembly byte code"
1253600,1260000," you can store it in an array um i think it would be better to zip it maybe is compress it somehow"
1260000,1266240," does the browser the standard library of browser or whatever like browser api have anything for"
1266240,1272080," compressing and uncompressing the the bytes the byte arrays or something like that does it have something"
1272080,1280160," like that does anybody know yes so it does have so there's some sort of api in a browser that you use"
1280160,1287040," can use from javascript to just compress and compress things like jzip jnzip um right in that case what you"
1287040,1293440," can do you can take web assembly module the byte code of a web assembly module compress it with jzip and"
1293440,1300480," encode it with something that is text for instance base64 or maybe hex or maybe just straight up uh javascript"
1300480,1307840," array and those save even like more uh more space in your bundle something like that so"
1307840,1316400," um okay so the the next thing we need to do we need to uh like maybe add some sort of a button"
1316400,1324080," lebatone lebatone that uh actually indicates that you can go full screen right somewhere here like you"
1324080,1328800," you can't really see that because it's behind my camera but i want something like in here right i want"
1328800,1337280," something something in here right but uh i think we also need to check if um rendering still works"
1337280,1345280," so let's actually try to render so i'm now pressing r and this is quite important actually so we need to"
1345280,1353280," not forget um to mention somewhere that now uh rendering is actually r instead of f"
1353280,1359520," so this one is actually too long can i escape so yeah there is a little bit of a problem with escaping and"
1359520,1370240," cancelling rendering of the video uh right because um we actually send uh data to ffmpeg faster that it"
1370240,1378400," manages to process it right and when we close the pipe through which we're sending frames to ffmpeg uh it"
1378400,1385440," doesn't exit automatically because it still has a bunch of frames in its backlog so it doesn't exit"
1385440,1394320," until it finishes those so right uh and i wonder if there is a way to tell it like abandon all of the"
1394320,1399840," frames you have on your queue just abandon all of them and just quit all right i wonder if there is a way"
1399840,1405840," to say something like that or maybe you just send a signal to it or maybe reduce the size of the queue or"
1405840,1410480," some there should be some way to do that so i think uh i think i even have to do for that so"
1410480,1413760," uh we will think about that in the future we'll think about that in the future"
1413760,1420960," uh maybe send a signal i think sending a signal is a good idea right so ascending a single is rather"
1420960,1426640," good idea because i'm pretty sure ffmpeg handles the signals right it handles the signals and it will"
1426640,1432880," probably try to finalize the video correctly right so i don't remember how does it react to just the regular"
1432880,1439360," control s control c not s control c probably finalize everything um right but the question"
1439360,1445840," is how do you do that on windows right do you have a posix style signals on windows is that a thing"
1445840,1451680," because yeah so a sick term sick kill that's very cool but all of that is posix but what about the"
1451680,1456880," you know the operating system for video games right that's the operating system that is specifically"
1456880,1464800," designed to play video games has posix signals right because you don't need posix symbols signals to play"
1464800,1471360," video games like how do you apply posix singles in signals in the video game setting so video game"
1471360,1477200," is just like a full screen thing that takes up like everything and like where is the signal so there's no"
1477200,1486480," things that communicate in each other i mean the the question is still valid is there something like"
1486480,1500560," that in windows um probably we'll see because as far as i know windows implements a little bit of the"
1500560,1511120," post x just a tiny bit just"
1511120,1522480," anyways anyways anyways anyways so i wanted to create a little baton uh lebaton uh so here is the preview"
1522480,1529040," rendering so this is the preview rendering and after we finished render it rendering everything what we"
1529040,1534960," can try to do we can try to draw a rectangle right so let's try to draw a rectangle uh so this is going"
1534960,1542320," to be the text uh okay so this is going to be just zero zero um 100 by 100 and the color is going to be"
1542320,1548560," red so we're going to try to recompile this entire thing and i'm going to refresh uh right oh"
1552480,1555520," reflexes"
1555520,1569120," freaking reflexes okay so i have to press f5 there we go here is the it's really inconvenient f5 is really"
1569120,1576880," inconvenient i gotta tell you anyway so but i mean it's a development feature so the development developers"
1576880,1582000," have to suffer anyway right it's not for the end user and the user doesn't really have to suffer so"
1583120,1589360," anyway so i think this thing has to be inside of the preview right so it has to be inside of the"
1589360,1597600," preview so somebody suggesting h for hot reload and maybe i don't know so i want it to be some sort of"
1597600,1602560," a key yeah yeah i want it to be some sort of a key uh that is not one of the functional keys because i"
1602560,1609200," think functional keys is just like yikes too too too much to like you know reach with your with your"
1609200,1617200," fingers so let's actually do h so this is going to be h and uh let's put it like that let's put it like"
1617200,1629840," um so i'm gonna restart this entire stuff and yeah boy yeah boy all right so i'm gonna put my favorite song"
1629840,1639200," and let me see if that stuff still works because now i can change this entire thing to green for"
1639200,1646480," instance i can change it to green and i'm gonna reload this entire stuff and boom it's green can your react"
1646720,1653760," do that can hot reload react you cannot you need a separate library for that but we have that out of"
1653760,1662800," the box we are using literal mechanism of operating system operating system and you need a separate"
1662800,1672080," library for that anyway so uh let's actually make it something like whites right so let's make it"
1672080,1683440," something like white uh to be i'm gonna regret it i'm really gonna regret it uh but maybe it's just a"
1683440,1692720," matter of getting used to that because i've been using r for hot reloading for so long"
1693440,1700080," um it's very difficult to to change the habits uh anyway so let's actually try to place this entire"
1700080,1707120," thing on the preview boundary right so so the preview boundary is going to be x so we got that"
1707120,1717760," preview boundary y and it's going to be 100 100 blah blah blah as usual as usual as usual as usual so i'm"
1717760,1724400," going to restart that and boom so it is within uh this entire thing but to be fair personally i want"
1724400,1730400," it to be somewhere maybe here or maybe it has to be somewhere here i think it has to be somewhere here"
1731360,1739520," uh right so that means uh let's actually have some sort of a constant right so maybe something like a"
1739520,1748000," full screen lobotone and it's going to be 100 right so that's the full screen level two and let's do full"
1748000,1758240," screen and that's the whole thing so in terms of x now it has to be preview plus the preview boundary"
1758240,1770640," width the preview boundary width but minus the size of the full screen lobotone simple maps right simple maps"
1770640,1777520," maps so that way it is aligned to the right as"
1777520,1785280," uh as simple as"
1785280,1793040," right it is aligned to the right so maybe this is where we want to do that right so maybe this is"
1793280,1805760," um okay so uh let me let me see we need to have some sort of like a padding right so full uh full"
1805760,1813120," screen button padding it's it's more of a margin i think it's more of a margin right so let's actually"
1813120,1823120," make it 10 pixels and essentially it is going to sort of move uh this entire thing to the to the left"
1823120,1832480," on x and down on y right so roughly like that so roughly like that so let me uh so now i have to"
1832480,1836880," be really very careful right so i'm going to press h and there we go so as you can see it actually"
1836880,1842800," has a little bit of a padding in here and we can now even control this entire padding we can say"
1842800,1849920," so what about if it was maybe 15 right how about 50 right so i'm going to do that so and i can control"
1849920,1866080," that quite easy in c so maybe the size of this lobotone uh has to be slightly smaller what about 75 so"
1868480,1876000," yeah so that's uh that's uh that's a little bit better that's a little bit better maybe even a 60"
1876000,1884720," and maybe how about some 69 a 69 so this is lebaton right so that's basically lebaton"
1884720,1895120," okay so um i suppose it has to have the color the same as this thing right it has to have this specific"
1895120,1902320," color and as far as i know i actually consolidated that color in here so we have color track panel"
1902320,1909920," like button background so we can use that uh we can probably even define color full screen button"
1909920,1918640," background and we can say that it is equal to the same color as um the color background so maybe"
1918640,1924480," button background so let's say that it's going to be like literally the same right it is literally the same"
1925040,1931600," uh all right so let's actually go back to where we were right go back to where we were and try to"
1931600,1937040," recompile this entire thing and boom look at that does it look cool does it look cool i think it looks"
1937040,1944240," pretty cool right so it probably needs to be sort of like around it right so it needs to have rounded"
1944240,1950000," corners as in here right as you can see there's a little bit of rounded corners there's not that much"
1950000,1958080," anti-aliasing but i mean if we do full screen it gets a little bit bad right at least the the scroll"
1958080,1963840," button actually kind of becomes a little bit better but i mean if you look from the far away uh it looks"
1963840,1970480," all right so i think i think i think we need to do something similar uh so if i remember correctly draw"
1970480,1978080," round um rectangle yeah rounded so draw rectangle rounded we can try to use something like this"
1978080,1986640," rectangle rounded but this one actually accepts uh a rectangle roundness and segments uh instead of like"
1986640,1993840," x y uh width and height so that means we need to put all of that stuff put a little stuff into a separate"
1993840,1997920," rectangle so let's actually quickly do that uh let's actually quickly do that so we need some sort of a"
1997920,2007040," rectangle uh full screen uh button boundary right so that this is basically the boundary and we can"
2007040,2015840," simply move all of that stuff in here so that way we can just use it like that right so we can just use"
2015840,2020720," it like that the next thing is going to be around this i'm not quite sure what kind of roundness do we"
2020720,2027200," want to have in here so here we're using 0.8 and 20 so maybe i'm going to use the same parameters in here"
2027200,2034000," right so segments and then the color is this one uh right so let's try to compile this entire thing"
2034000,2037600," all right so we're going to try to compile and there we go"
2037600,2043120," so that's the roundness i think it's too much for the roundness of this particular"
2043120,2048320," but maybe it's fine what do you guys think is that a good roundness is that a good roundness i'm"
2048320,2054320," not quite sure uh we can make the roundness a little bit smaller maybe so maybe nine"
2054320,2060000," uh right so uh did it actually"
2060000,2065600," oh so let me see so roundness"
2066880,2077600," ah so roundness zero roundness zero is actually no roundness whatsoever i see the bigger okay okay"
2077600,2083360," what about like half of the roundness then right so it's from zero to one the classical interpolation"
2083920,2090720," the class this is already better i kind of like how it looks like right i kind of like how it looks like"
2090720,2100240," so that's a pretty cool liberty liberty so uh now what we need to do uh we want to highlight it when we"
2100240,2106080," actually hover over that specific button right like in here when we hover over it we want to highlight it"
2106080,2111920," so we need to know that we're inside of that button or not so as far as i know we have the mouse uh"
2111920,2116800," pointer somewhere here do we have it i think we don't right but in any case i'm going to just do"
2116800,2126800," check collision point uh rectangle so mouse versus full screen button boundary right and if we are"
2126800,2132560," inside of it maybe we want to do something about it for instance we can change the color so we can"
2132560,2138720," actually factor out the color into a separate uh variable right so this is going to be the color"
2138720,2144240," right so maybe let's put it like this so this is the core and initially it's going to be that maybe"
2144240,2149600," initially it's not going to be anything right and in here it's going to be color just that there we go so"
2149600,2155840," this is the full screen background color and let's introduce another one right so introduce another one"
2155840,2163440," which is going to be hover over right so full screen button background hover over which is the same as"
2163440,2172240," the uh track button hover over hover over there we go let's actually go back and this one is hover over"
2172240,2177680," there we go so maybe we can even turn this entire thing into a single line because it's not that big"
2177680,2184320," anymore uh so that looks fine that looks fine so this entire thing could have been like its own"
2184320,2189920," component right so we can put all of that behind its own scope and maybe eventually we're going to"
2189920,2195200," turn it into a separate function similar to timeline tracks panel and stuff like that as you can see each"
2195200,2201360," individual component is its own function that accepts the boundary within which you want to render all of"
2201360,2206240," that i think that makes sense right so we have this individual components that you can reuse and stuff"
2206240,2213120," like that so eventually you have your own react it's not really react it's closer to imgui but i mean"
2213120,2221200," you get you get the idea so to be fair imgui is way more reactive than react uh i'm telling you right"
2221200,2228320," because it's like yeah it's checking the state on the level of each individual like frame or something"
2228880,2234560," so back to two so it's always consistent it's always consistent no matter the the current frame"
2234560,2242320," get a mouse a position right so we're gonna get the mouse position and uh let me refresh this entire thing"
2242320,2252560," and oh it's it's the it's the other way around right so uh let's actually try to swap all of that so if mouse uh"
2253680,2261600," within that's kind of strange right so let me maybe there's something wrong with the background no"
2261600,2272560," everything's fine uh with the background background is kind of uh is kind of yeah but then track hover over"
2272560,2279440," uh huh so brightness is a little bigger so and that's what we're using in here oh yeah it's it is in"
2279440,2297680," fact the other way around okay so i didn't really notice that i didn't really notice that so now look at"
2297680,2312400," what kind of icons can we have in there what kind of icons can we have in here i don't know we can"
2312400,2320960," actually try to start inkscape i think let's start inkscape inkscape svg icon yeah so some sort of svg icon"
2320960,2332480," but i'm not sure if ray lip can work with svgs svg's nuts oh god sorry uh so um what we're gonna do in"
2332480,2338320," here is there any way to do a different background uh checkerboard background so it's too much it's"
2338320,2347040," probably gonna um okay i can oh yo look at that isn't that a pause i think oh my god that's that's beautiful"
2348720,2356640," so let's start with a rectangle right so it's supposed to have um yeah it's supposed to have"
2356640,2364320," the um the stroke around it right so it's actually going to be 100 maybe 100 is too much let's say 20."
2364320,2368880," so that's basically what we have in here i suppose this one is going to be something like that and there"
2368880,2376480," will be no actual background in here so maybe we can do something like this all right so this could be"
2376480,2381440," like that but i mean it's too probably too much one of the things we can do we can just like"
2381440,2388560," round it up like so all right we can try to round things up like so but still keep this thing like that"
2388560,2396480," yeah yeah so something like this right something like this and let's make it maybe 10 and of course this"
2396480,2403120," entire thing has to be square right now it's not particularly square so let's make it 100 by 100 yeah there we go"
2404400,2413360," and essentially um we can try to have another rectangle right so this one is going to be something"
2413360,2419680," like this uh yeah something like this and we're going to put it so i probably want to have some sort of"
2419680,2432400," alignment that is aligned uh at the center right so this is basically at the center uh then we can have something like"
2432400,2439920," this which we want to rotate 90 degrees and probably also align at the center so can we take this thing"
2439920,2447680," and then this thing and then subtract one from another so there is a difference okay so that uh kind"
2447680,2453840," of worked um but not the way i expected it to work but we can try to do that one more time"
2454400,2459200," uh all right so then we can do path uh and then difference"
2459200,2467440," yeah so that's basically the icon for full screen or something like that could that be the the icon for"
2467440,2477840," full screen i don't know so what's the icon in youtube uh right so let's actually go to youtube"
2477840,2484320," looks amazing kind of work okay so we can do that um uh trying kotlin for the first time"
2484320,2488320," wait did they try kotlin"
2490480,2491280," i don't remember"
2491280,2496480," i honestly don't remember like"
2496480,2505280," do i know yeah yeah okay so this is what i was trying to go for right so but it actually put these"
2505280,2511280," additional things and it don't really know like how to but that's probably fine that's even probably"
2511280,2520560," better right so this kind of thing is even better yeah uh okay so let's actually go to um this kind of"
2520560,2527760," thing so resize page content so resize page on drawing or selection uh for those who's interested"
2527760,2538240," interesting why am i so good at this kind of thing uh this is because uh i do my thumbnails in inkscape"
2539200,2544960," so i can i'm kind of good at inkscape because i grinded it for quite some time already right"
2544960,2552480," so yeah that's why i'm kind of good with it uh so now if i yeah so that's like that"
2552480,2562480," so actually i use a combination of krita and inkscape i use krita when i can't just do"
2562480,2568400," the vector graphics so sometimes sometimes maybe i want to do additional effects right that are not"
2568400,2575520," present in inkscape so i do post processing in in krita yeah i do a lot of post processing in krita"
2575520,2582800," actually uh right because i need to crank up the saturation to make the uh the neurons you know"
2582800,2587200," activate in people's brain when they scroll through youtube right you need to crank up"
2587200,2590480," the saturation so that's very important i can do that only in krita"
2594720,2598560," it's very important right so i'm giving you a way like youtube tricks"
2598560,2606400," saturation saturation contrast contrast is really important"
2606400,2612560," uh so there's also an interesting trick that is like also super important i'm gonna give you"
2612560,2621920," away that for free so take uh the home page right take your home page and then uh basically screenshot and"
2621920,2630400," photoshop your uh thumbnail in here photoshop it in here and then just move away on the distance and"
2630400,2637760," just squint your eyes and make sure is your thumbnail noticeable in that setting so basically"
2637760,2644080," is your thumbnail noticeable when you just glance over the home page and if it is that means it's going"
2644080,2648720," it's going to be noticeable in any possible setting so it's going to stand out so that's how you do that"
2648720,2650160," um right"
2650160,2654080," so that's one of the important things"
2654080,2664400," so um because of that something like just a red background kind of fits that definition right if you"
2664400,2669600," just like make a thumbnail that is red background it's going to fit the definition that i gave you"
2669600,2676160," perfectly and it's going to work but it's going to work only for one time because people are not dumb"
2676160,2683200," right so they can fall off for that once but then once they're familiar with your content they will"
2683200,2688720," have this association of this red thingy with your content and they're not going to fall for that twice"
2688720,2692560," so the second time this kind of thing is not going to work uh all right"
2692560,2700720," next time you go pink yeah exactly you have to switch the colors all the time right so you just"
2700720,2702320," keep keep scrolling through the colors"
2702320,2710720," what a psyop yes believe it or not like professional youtubers like uh"
2710720,2715360," are psyops specialists like they know how to do psyops um so"
2715360,2727440," so it's it's actually freaking insane like um anyway i'm not really that good at it unfortunately"
2727440,2733680," right so uh because i don't get paid for it uh so i don't have don't have that much that much"
2733680,2740080," motivation to to go too deep into this kind of stuff it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't okay so"
2740080,2750480," let's actually save this choice so uh let me let me see so we have like different resources like we"
2750480,2760160," already have okay so there's resources logo uh we can create maybe icons all right so and this is where"
2760160,2769680," we can try to save this entire thing um all right so this is gonna be that and this is full screen look i"
2769680,2772720," i didn't even have to steal anything from the internet isn't that cool"
2772720,2779360," you didn't even have to steal anything it's just like yeah just a bunch of shapes"
2779360,2784480," and there you go you get an icon i didn't even have to use midjourney imagine using midjourney just to"
2784480,2796080," get that um all right so uh let's try to convert that into png because we probably won't have png"
2796080,2800960," right so but um using image magic is actually kind of dumb for this kind of thing you will see why"
2800960,2811200," because by default image magic will give you white background on svg right so you have white uh sort of"
2811200,2818400," like outline and then white background and it looks like it's just like yeah so in image magic you have to"
2818400,2828480," do i think background none and only then it will create png it didn't even work right it didn't even"
2828480,2836000," work so i don't remember how to do that uh maybe you have to put it somewhere here does it really matter"
2836000,2840480," yeah so it does matter where exactly you put it it's like ffm pack"
2840480,2846720," yes it's like it maybe it is literally like ffm pack right so maybe all of the"
2846720,2853120," all of the flags are like associated with the input up until you provide the input and then the next"
2853120,2858240," flags are associated with the output up until the moment you provide out maybe like image magic literally"
2858240,2865120," works like ffm pack who knows so maybe ffm pack is not the only program that follows that paradigm okay"
2865120,2871520," so the the thing we need to do we need to load this up unfortunately i don't have a way to add new"
2871520,2879680," resources to the application without restarting the whole application so i can't hot reload uh new resources"
2880640,2886160," because i never really developed a mechanism for that i think if i spend some time developing a"
2886160,2891280," mechanism for that maybe i could do that um right maybe we need to have some sort of a mechanism of"
2891280,2902800," catalog right so a catalog basically the the file system within which you are yeah so essentially uh you"
2904000,2911200," try to access the resource by its file path and if it's not loaded if it's not loaded it's going"
2911200,2916560," to be loaded for the first time um yeah i think we need to develop a system like that"
2916560,2920000," right a system like that sort of like an asset manager"
2920000,2927200," um wait you can hot reload yes i can i can even show you so for instance instance do you see the button"
2927200,2933440," in here do you see the button i can go to plug uh c and i can essentially change the color"
2933440,2939120," of this entire thing to red right in the native code right in the native c code by the way so the"
2939120,2946240," only thing i need to do i need to recompile my web pack bundle and then hot reload and as you can see"
2946240,2952720," it's red now it is right now so it's a native application native application written and see"
2952720,2962880," no electron no jbm no anything like that native application written and see and if you wonder how did"
2962880,2970560," i manage to do that well uh this is a secret that was forgotten in software development this is literally"
2970560,2979600," the basic mechanism that is provided by your operating system being able to hot reload a program a native"
2979600,2988320," program is the basic mechanism that exists in any modern operating system windows linux mac os it just exists"
2988320,2994880," there programmers being caught up with web technologies for so long they completely forgot that this kind of"
2994880,2995440," exists"
2995440,3005680," so people literally forgetting how to develop software like literally unironically they don't remember how to do that"
3006240,3016640," um anyways so but i won't be able to hot reload the assets right because i don't have a"
3016640,3022080," like a good sort of abstraction for that i kind of know what kind of obstructions i want to have but"
3022720,3031600," uh right we'll see we'll see"
3031600,3044800," so full screen icon right so and uh when we do plug in it right when we do plug in it we actually load a bunch of things in here so specifically"
3044800,3058600," so full screen icon right so and when we do plug init right when we do plug init we actually load"
3058600,3065380," a bunch of things in here so specifically uh yeah we're loading the ttf the font and stuff like that"
3065380,3070580," so one of the things we probably want to do want to do full screen um icon right so we're going to"
3070580,3077500," do load image right and here it's just a simple function that uh accepts the file path right so"
3077500,3085080," it accepts the file path so here we have to do resources um and so i think it's icons so"
3085080,3097220," let me see resources icons okay uh and yes yes yes uh full screen png"
3097220,3105240," okay go full screen png so we'll have to recompile this entire stuff uh and restart it from scratch"
3105240,3113320," completely so does it say that we managed to load full screen png yes as you can see full screen pg"
3113320,3119900," has been loaded successfully that is absolutely epic that is absolutely epic not gonna lie"
3119900,3135360," uh right so full screen uh button full screen button and what we want to do here so here we just"
3135360,3144180," a render rectangle rounded thingy majing so that's what we do that's what we do so uh in here we need to"
3144180,3150880," draw image yeah can we even draw the image i don't think so so let's actually go to ray dip"
3150880,3158640," we can do the following thing i can use google right so i'm going to go to google uh right so google"
3158640,3165900," i'm going to provide the ray dip src um yeah this one src ray leap"
3165900,3174420," dot h and i'm going to try to put a query in there i'm going to try to put a query in there what's"
3174420,3180520," going to be the query so thing that accepts an image something that accepts an image so what kind of"
3180520,3192120," functions accept image um right not that many uh but so something that also accepts maybe a couple of"
3192120,3201580," integers uh you can image resize so i think you cannot draw image yeah you can draw texture"
3201580,3206280," texture you can draw texture so i think it's more like a texture to d"
3206280,3215980," uh-huh yeah yeah so okay so here it is oh i probably should use uh maybe nested yeah"
3215980,3225180," yeah so something like this we can draw texture but we can't draw image there's no such thing as draw image"
3225180,3234460," so that means we will have to uh turn a image into a texture so image texture"
3234460,3241500," image texture yeah load texture from image so that's one of the things we want to be able to do"
3241500,3248540," uh load texture from image so okay so that's fine so let's go ahead and do that"
3248540,3256940," uh full screen uh full screen uh icon let's call it image then uh and then we're going to have a texture"
3256940,3264380," 2d so this is texture so let's go to the compilation errors uh yes yes yes where is my knob"
3264380,3269660," all right so full screen image uh and"
3272140,3283660," full screen texture load texture from image on this one boom so what's going to be the next thing"
3283660,3292540," draw texture uh ex do we want to do ex i'm not quite sure so but the texture that i want to render"
3292540,3299420," so we probably do want to have that because we'll need to scale it at some point"
3299980,3307420," right so the texture we need to render in here is full screen texture right so full screen texture"
3307420,3314460," what's the position at what position we are rendering this entire stuff um we are rendering it at position"
3314460,3319740," of the full screen button boundary so that's where we're rendering this entire thing right so that's"
3319740,3326700," where we're rendering this entire thing so i can just set the rotation uh i'm sure if you can see all that"
3326700,3334140," stuff maybe maybe you can uh right so but i'm gonna just put it like that i'm gonna just put it like"
3334140,3340460," that uh so rotation is going to be zero scale um i'm gonna put it like this and the tint is going to"
3340460,3348860," be white right so this is going to be white float scale for now it's going to be one uh the position"
3348860,3359180," is going to be something like this so vector two position and we are taking full screen button boundary"
3359180,3375020," and we take x and y we take x and y um honestly we can actually do something like plus plus the width by um"
3376860,3383580," but divided by two right so and then the height but divided by two so i want to rend i want to center"
3383580,3389740," the icon yeah at the center of the button so that's what i want to do i just like i want to center it"
3389740,3397100," right there so uh i just add that but then i'll have to subtract the uh half of the width of the icon"
3397100,3405100," and it's something full screen uh image i think width is in fact available in there so if i take"
3405100,3413500," a look at the image uh right so image uh here is the definition it does have width and height so which"
3413500,3419900," is precisely what i need in here so it's going to be width two and in here we'll have to subtract"
3420700,3429340," subtract subtract half of the height so it may go over the boundaries it may go over the boundaries"
3429340,3437100," because it's actually rather huge uh right so if you take a look at the other resources at the icon"
3437100,3444780," it's rather huge uh so file so let me show yeah it's 378 so it's kind of too big"
3445660,3451420," so we probably want to make it smaller right but they want to want to see how big it's going to be"
3451420,3456940," all right it's going to be kind of funny i think it's going to be kind of funny how big it is uh"
3456940,3462140," right so it seems to be compiling okay so let's restart this entire stuff let's copy paste some stuff"
3462140,3474860," in here there we go that that's the icon"
3474860,3486540," isn't it a bogue isn't it a bogue is this freaking bogue mate uh okay so one of the things we can do"
3486540,3492060," we can actually scale it right so we have uh you know a scale parameter for reasons so we can just"
3492060,3499660," just make it half right so we can make it half uh right so and let's just let it go so it's smaller"
3499660,3503500," but they're not really that smaller that much smaller so that means we have to"
3503500,3513980," use the scale thingy uh scale thingy for the um uh for this thing so we need to scale up"
3513980,3521660," this stuff so this is going to be multiplied by scale so it's adjust itself a little bit better"
3521980,3540300," uh right uh right so now no uh right we can keep adjusting this stuff we can keep adjusting this"
3540300,3551340," stuff uh and becomes smaller and smaller to be fair i think this stuff uh has to be dependent on the button"
3551340,3555500," size right on the button size so we already have a full screen"
3555500,3569500," button so this is more of a size and we can use it like this so yeah we can divide this thing by the"
3569500,3576780," full screen width or something like that so since this thing is way smaller maybe that will create a very"
3576780,3581580," interesting so maybe not i don't think it's particularly great idea but oh okay so that's kind of cool and"
3581580,3589340," then we can say that um it's half of that so it's actually accidentally uh adjusted it perfectly right"
3589340,3595180," so it accidentally adjusted it perfectly so we can do 75. where is my anti-aliasing this is disgusting"
3598140,3612140," um okay so what about i think half was kind of okay maybe half was kind of okay maybe six was kind of okay"
3612140,3622220," yeah this is good this is kind of good so we also it's a little bit too bright i think so for example in"
3622220,3629100," here this is not white isn't it i don't remember the color of the text that is used for the uh track"
3629100,3639420," panel right so track panel so what's the color of the text we use in the air chat so draw text that's just"
3639420,3649660," white okay so that's kind of unexpected but okay so what if we use color um you can't really see scheiße minor for"
3649660,3661020," into uh yeah so color brightness so we take white but we just make it a little bit darker like this"
3661020,3666700," so that's going to be the tint of the texture hopefully yeah so okay that's a little bit better"
3666700,3672940," so i think white was a little bit too bright uh for this thing so maybe we can even make it a little bit"
3672940,3679100," darker in here yeah so that's what do we think so in terms of color i think that's a little bit better"
3679660,3685260," right in terms of color but i don't like the lack of anti-aliasing it's a little bit too harsh"
3685260,3690620," one of the things we can try to do we can try to set the texture filter for this entire thing but that"
3690620,3697980," will yet again require re restarting this entire thing uh right so when we load this entire stuff"
3697980,3705020," when we load this entire stuff if i remember correctly there was a set texture filter that's right"
3705020,3710060," that's right that's right so texture filter we're taking this goddamn texture and we're setting a"
3710060,3721260," bilinear filter by linear filter texture uh filter by linear by linear we've set that scheiße in here"
3721260,3728060," and that should smooth it out just a tiny bit just a tiny bit just a tiny bit just a tiny bit so let's"
3728060,3734220," actually restart this entire stuff let's put this stuff in here boom that's a little bit better maybe"
3734220,3743900," probably uh yeah i guess i guess i i think i would like to make it uh make the tint of this entire stuff"
3743900,3754220," even more uh you know grayish even like half or something like that uh yeah that would go so something"
3754220,3763740," like this is actually kind of good looks the same yeah it kind of does still looks like looks like"
3763740,3774300," shit um okay so all right so something like this uh we can it will be kind of nice to have two versions"
3774300,3781020," of it right so when you're doing it like that when you hover it just like puts these things apart a little"
3781020,3792540," bit uh right um looks inverted looks more like go out of full screen oh yeah probably uh but i mean"
3792540,3797180," we just need something in here right so we just need something in here so it looks like a full screen"
3797180,3804700," button uh we can adjust the communication to the user a little bit later uh the gray makes it look"
3804700,3808700," and clickable yeah maybe okay so about 10"
3808700,3818700," yeah probably also there is a little bit of a strange thing in here uh is that it doesn't really"
3818700,3824940," the fact that it doesn't really adjust its size according to the size of the window is kind of weird"
3824940,3832940," but maybe i'll fix that a little bit later yeah i can i can fix that anyway so uh all of that is just the"
3832940,3842220," details all of that is just the details so now uh when we are inside when we are inside of this entire stuff"
3842220,3855820," and i know is mouse button um released mouse button left what do we do is we take the full screen"
3857340,3866700," uh all right uh all right so we take the full screen and we set it to true we set the full screen to true"
3868780,3880060," okay"
3880060,3893020," easy peasy lemon squeezy all right"
3895660,3900620," easy peasy lemon squeezy but we also need to have the same button when we are in full screen"
3900620,3905980," uh right so we need sort of like the same button where and we are in full screen"
3905980,3916220," um so what i'm thinking is that uh maybe i should finally factor out the entire body in here the entire"
3916220,3923260," body in here into um into its own thing right so maybe that would be that would be something something"
3923260,3937900," nice to have um right so let's do the following thing um full screen uh button and this is a function so"
3937900,3944460," we're going to have a function full screen button and i'm going to go up uh where we have all the"
3944460,3950540," components so here we have a tracks panel component right so it's it's the thing on the left uh right so"
3950540,3956060," so then we have a timeline and everything and uh there we go so i'm going to put this stuff in here"
3956060,3965340," and so this is going to be full screen uh button right so this is a full screen button"
3965340,3973340," so interestingly maybe it should accept the boundary in here but i'm not really 100 sure if that's a good"
3973340,3982460," idea um so we can do something interesting actually we can return boolean"
3982460,3992060," right so we can essentially return boolean like so"
3995740,4010780," so then we can take the place where we call this function and say okay um p full screen is equal to"
4010780,4021100," not full screen that way we can actually move this entire thing outside of the condition of whether we are"
4021100,4025980," in full screen or not full screen right so we're going to completely put this stuff outside"
4025980,4033100," and uh yeah so essentially it's going to be available in both of the cases so here's the"
4033100,4039900," interesting thing the full screen button depends on the preview boundary so maybe one of the things we"
4039900,4046380," have to pass in there is the preview boundary so that's actually very interesting so yeah that's that's"
4046380,4051100," one of the things we'll probably have to do so let's go to the compilation errors right so go to the"
4051100,4058300," compilation error so uh so what does it say expected identifier but gut oh yes this is a semicolon so"
4058300,4065100," that's fine so preview boundary so let's actually say that uh full screen button full screen button"
4065100,4072940," accepts the boundary of the preview for which it puts on the full screen i think that makes sense right so"
4072940,4078780," here we're going to take a rectangle uh and we can say preview boundary it's not the boundary of the"
4078780,4086620," button itself but the boundary of the preview window for which it puts that thing in the full screen"
4086620,4093100," uh right and it adjusts itself according to that preview boundary um so that's actually a good idea right"
4093100,4100380," i think i think it's generally a good idea so and what's interesting is now depending on whether we are in"
4100380,4106220," full screen or not full screen the preview boundary is different so that means we still have to have"
4106220,4114700," two instances of full screen in here so preview boundary here and another preview boundary in here"
4114700,4120540," because they are different depending on the on the mode right they are in fact different in the mode"
4120540,4124860," but maybe this is something that we want to have because we're going to have different icons depending on"
4124860,4131900," whether we are in full screen mode or not full screen mode right so essentially and the actual icon of"
4131900,4134540," full screen button is going to be the parameter of this function"
4134540,4139580," right so uh yes so yes so yes so"
4139580,4148380," okay so and let's actually um i think do i need to restart that i don't think so uh so now yeah there we go"
4149660,4154860," so the icon definitely has to be different but to be fair if we're going to go into the full screen i"
4154860,4162300," don't think i want to have this button here visible um i think we could try to pull off the trick where"
4162300,4169100," it's only visible when you're going very close to it with the mouse right if your mouse is far away it's"
4169100,4177100," going to be invisible or something like that so if you close enough it becomes uh half transparent"
4177100,4181420," right but if you close if you inside of it it becomes like fully transparent and you can actually do"
4181420,4187660," something that's a cool idea actually right and of course you need to have uh two separate uh two"
4187660,4193900," separate icons for that to indicate like maybe we even have need to have three icons because if i'm in"
4193900,4199740," this state when i hover over it it should switch the icon it should switch the icon and when i press"
4199740,4206780," it it should be a different icon so there's sort of like a state stuff uh right so yeah"
4206780,4214140," isn't that cool and you know what's cool is that all of that is in c you wouldn't think that this kind"
4214140,4220700," of ui development could be in c but we're doing that in c like it's like rough around the edges i do"
4220700,4225420," understand that but because we're it's in in the process of development right it is in fact in the"
4225420,4233820," process of development um so yeah the more time i spend on this thing the cooler it will look right"
4233820,4238300," so it's just a matter of how much time and effort i spend on this thing it's just going to become"
4238300,4241580," better and better and better and better uh right"
4246460,4250860," so uh somebody's saying something interesting factor out the reactivity and rendering to sort"
4250860,4256780," of components like an enemy and you go something better than react well yeah so essentially um i"
4256780,4263260," you you notice that how i just write down the code that needs to put something on the screen"
4263260,4272380," right until it becomes very messy but once it becomes very messy uh it becomes obvious how to factor it"
4272380,4281100," out into a sort of separate component right so full uh screen uh button right and we factored out full"
4281100,4287100," screen button function and it is sort of its own component that tacks into itself all of the mess that"
4287100,4294460," we had and now uh it has a logical parameters right so for example preview boundary with which it is"
4294460,4300220," associated is a logical parameter another logical parameter is going to be an icon that is currently"
4300220,4303980," displaying right so and depending on the state of duplication we're going to pass just different"
4303980,4309340," icon in there and you can parameterize this mess more and more until it feels like an actual component"
4309340,4315900," right and soon it becomes a library of different components and maybe at some point uh i will notice"
4315900,4324700," that i can factor out the button just a generic button out of the full screen button and reuse it for some"
4324700,4331500," other buttons so that way i will have a hierarchy of components i have just generic button that i can put"
4331500,4337020," anywhere then i have a full screen button that i can only put on a preview boundary at the corners there"
4337020,4341820," right and it uses functionality of a generic button there could be another button that also reuses the"
4341820,4348860," same generic functionality as the full screen button so you see people get turned off when they see my"
4348860,4355500," approach of just writing massive code that gets the job done but then i use that mess to tell me what"
4355500,4362460," kind of patterns i can extract and now i have components so the architecture writes itself depending"
4362460,4368700," on the problem that i'm solving i'm not trying to design up front i'm just letting the mess guide me to"
4368700,4376700," how i need to organize it right so you can't organize things before you know what you need to do"
4376700,4383660," first you need to explore first you need to know what you need to do makes sense it just makes sense"
4383660,4388140," right especially when you try it and see that yeah that makes sense you first try to solve the problem"
4388140,4393820," and then depending on the problem you organize it accordingly so if you don't want to do if you want"
4393820,4399420," to do up front designing of the architecture you literally need to simulate your program in your brain"
4401180,4405500," right because like it's like you don't know what you need like you need to explore that you need to"
4405500,4414060," discover all this stuff does it make sense i'm not sure if it makes sense yes so what we need in here"
4414060,4424700," right so what we need in here uh we need um essentially yeah different icons we need different icons in here"
4425180,4440140," um so let me actually pull it to do for that um so different full screen button icons depending on the"
4440140,4451100," current state of preview uh right so and another thing that i would like to have is if p full screen"
4454140,4467980," so do not show full screen button uh if the cursor is too far away from it right i kind of want to"
4467980,4474780," implement that you know idea where if you just put it away it's not visible but if you get closer it"
4474780,4481420," becomes visible because maybe you just want to uh essentially just put it in full screen as sort of a"
4481420,4487980," display or something all right and you don't want to the ui elements distract you or something like"
4487980,4493900," that so as far as i know quite often people put a timer on this kind of buttons right so especially"
4493900,4500940," youtube likes to do that right when you go in youtube in full screen you can see ui um for some time"
4500940,4507580," uh and if you idle for long enough it disappears maybe this is what we want to do"
4509180,4516700," this is a good idea actually uh so essentially if you like move around this button appears"
4516700,4519820," and if you idle long enough it just disappears"
4519820,4526860," that makes sense so and uh here we have uh event loop"
4526860,4534780," right so we have a plug update uh and in the plug update we can also get the time frame frame time i think"
4534780,4542540," yeah frame time and essentially we can have a variable uh that uh counts the time right so every"
4542540,4550460," time you move your mouse around right you move your mouse around that timer gets reset and it counts down"
4550460,4555740," with get frame time until it reaches zero and as soon as it reaches zero we just don't show that element"
4555740,4560220," and then you move around if the timer gets reset it's actually really relatively easy to implement"
4560220,4569740," i think so the question is how can we know that the mouse moved um because there is no event system and"
4569740,4576620," ray leap you can only get what happened you don't get notified you can only ask what happened so there"
4576620,4584140," should be something you can get the mouse position but i feel like uh you can also get mouse position"
4584140,4591580," delta go get mouse position yeah i get mouse position delta so that's actually really interesting"
4591580,4604380," so delta between frames and i suppose uh we can just get the length of that delta and if it's zero that means the"
4604380,4613260," mouse was not moved between the frames so it stands still all right so uh let me try to do something in"
4613260,4621660," here right let me try to do something in here uh so this is going to be plug so this is a full screen um"
4621660,4632540," so float full screen timer right so this is a full screen timer when it is zero uh we're not going to show"
4632540,4642620," anything i suppose i suppose like a zero or less um right so if p uh full screen so full screen button"
4642620,4657900," if p full screen uh timer is greater than zero we showing a lebaton we are showing the lebaton uh then"
4658860,4663820," another thing we probably want to do we want to subtract we want to subtract we want to subtract"
4663820,4671020," the get frame time we want to count it down so if it's already zero or less than zero it's not going"
4671020,4677180," to be updated the next thing we want to do after that we're going to take mouse delta and we probably want"
4677180,4687180," to do something like vector to length and if this thing is greater than zero this entire timer is going to be reset"
4687180,4696380," to for how long we want this thing to be uh to be visible three seconds i think is all right right so"
4696380,4701340," it's going to be on the screen for three seconds it's going to be on the screen for three seconds and after"
4701340,4707260," that uh it's going to disappear it's going to disappear like immediately maybe we we want to fade it out"
4707820,4715660," right maybe we want to fade it out uh all right so i think three seconds is all right so vector to"
4715660,4722940," length is not a thing all right i wonder why okay it compiled anyway so that means it is it was found by"
4722940,4728300," the linker right so i probably need to do something like ray math right so the definition is probably"
4728300,4737100," somewhere in the ray map uh look at that it's not all right so all right all right so i'm gonna re uh okay"
4738700,4747900," uh today that was weird but anyway uh okay"
4747900,4766540," uh okay so uh no set timeout we don't have any set timeout or anything like that and you can just do"
4766540,4775340," that so and probably because we're organizing our own event loop right because uh javascript people"
4775340,4782380," have to use set timeout and everything because they don't have a control over the event loop the event"
4782380,4788140," loop is implemented for them by more experienced developers right by more experienced developers and"
4788140,4792780," it's baked into the javascript runtime they can't control it that's why they have to go through this"
4792780,4798380," hoop of set timeout and stuff like that we have our own event loop that's why we don't need to have"
4798380,4806060," set timeout we can bake whatever functionality we want straight into the event loop that's how real"
4806060,4814620," developers write software they modify event loop directly because they have an access to it unlike those"
4814620,4819900," javascript developers"
4819900,4825020," anyways so so we got that so there is a little bit of a problem"
4825020,4830540," uh so um yeah"
4830540,4837500," i think when i do that for the first time yes we use we use to cover you freaking this"
4837500,4842300," right when i do that for the first time it's equal to zero"
4842300,4844060," it disappears kind of"
4844060,4852540," it kind of disappears so maybe uh we have to set it to three right away during the initialization"
4852540,4862460," uh all right where's the plugin in it uh so yes so full screen timer and this is going to be three"
4862460,4869420," um so i think i need to factor out this magical constant to something else but i'm not really sure"
4870060,4873180," uh full screen timer"
4873180,4878620," uh full screen timer sex it's a seconds it's not what you thought it's like"
4878620,4885420," uh full um today yeah full screen time"
4885420,4889980," chat chat"
4893660,4901500," full screen timer timer sex all right so uh you see a you see a you see a you see"
4901500,4913740," um so yeah we'll have to restart one more time i have to restart one more time"
4915340,4921500," so now i press it appears until we are the long enough and that's good"
4921500,4931980," full sex yes got your hyper uh it's pretty cool to be fair"
4934460,4937420," i mean i mean do we want to keep it like that"
4937420,4945420," so the encoding probably right now is i realized that so i'm sorry i'm just testing things i'm just"
4945420,4953580," testing things uh right so here we go can you click it while while it disappeared let's actually see"
4955580,4961580," see you can't you can't you can't because we literally don't render it and don't handle it"
4961580,4968380," right so you first need to make it appear and only then you can click it so you can't click it well"
4968380,4973660," it's why it's not it's a good question yeah i think it's all right it's a reasonable relatively reasonable"
4973660,4998140," behavior so maybe we want to add some more stuff in here so we we have the scroll bar"
5004300,5009980," um don't disappear if the cursor is on top i don't know i think the current behavior is all right"
5009980,5016220," uh i think it is all right yeah so it's not really full screen it's a full window right so full screen"
5016220,5021420," is going to be if you uh you know really do full screen right like like a video game"
5021420,5027500," uh right but this is just like a full window so you're trying to hide the elements right if you want"
5027500,5033180," to just showcase it like that uh right because i saw the use case of mutualizer like this"
5033980,5038140," there there was a use case for mutualizer like this where people was just like showing off on their"
5038140,5043980," under a desktop right and so that's what i'm trying to facilitate in here right so just enable people to"
5043980,5051180," do this kind of stuff all right so we fixed that to do right so i think we did in fact fix that to do"
5051180,5057900," right away uh and the only to do that is left is icons i suppose right so we want to have different"
5057900,5062060," kinds of icons depending on the situation and stuff like that but i'm already streaming for one and"
5062060,5068620," half of an hour uh right and i want to make a break uh unix porn screenshot yeah yeah somebody posted"
5068620,5074860," like mutualizer on unix porn and uh so that means there is such use case and i don't want to kill"
5074860,5080780," it accidentally all right so since i'm being an ethical open source software developer i'm not"
5080780,5086380," going to add any telemetry into my software because it's disgusting like you literally turning your"
5086380,5092300," software into malware right so i'm not putting any telemetry so the only way i can gather information"
5092300,5098140," about use cases is just by observing how people use it in the wild right by observing how people use it in"
5098140,5107340," blah it's kind of interesting like what if people who develop um software instead of um turning their"
5107340,5115820," software into malware right by adding telemetry and stuff like that they spend time on monitoring reddit"
5115820,5121900," twitter and social networks and gathering information about use cases from there because people are showing"
5121900,5127900," off how they're using their software how they do these kind of things they write tutorials and stuff like"
5127900,5135660," that so why not develop a technology that scrapes all of that and summarizes and organizes and tells"
5135660,5142460," you more about how your users use your thing it's probably not a full information right so some stuff can"
5142460,5151580," get outdated and everything um right but it's more ethical at least maybe i'm not sure like i'm never really do"
5152140,5158780," being in full charge of like very big commercial software right so maybe i'm saying gibberish right"
5158780,5167340," so maybe it's not feasible to do it like that but i have a feeling as you know um i have a feeling that"
5167340,5175100," that could be also a feasible thing and more ethical yeah i don't know i'm not a big fan of telemetry but"
5175100,5180460," the problem is that most people are not vocal about their use of software we need telemetry to observe"
5180460,5185980," people who are slightly suffering so to speak yeah i understand i understand that argument i was just"
5185980,5192940," thinking about it so if we're talking about the paid software can you just maybe disable"
5192940,5201420," telemetry and give a discount for people who enable telemetry something like that"
5203900,5206860," so essentially you're buying data from the users"
5206860,5214700," yeah so you're basically buying the data from the users you give them discount for your software"
5214700,5220620," so that way you can you know make it better so we can then make more money for that um"
5222060,5228940," so cheaper software if you give away freedom yeah exactly"
5228940,5238060," since technically you're selling them your data just that nowadays they're getting it for free yeah"
5238060,5244700," exactly so basically just you know pay users for for the data right just pay them in the form of discount"
5244700,5253020," so maybe that's reasonable so uh i would like to make a break uh because i need to refill my tea and"
5253020,5260460," stuff like that and after the break after the break i think we're gonna uh finish it off right so the"
5260460,5266700," last thing i probably want to do is i want to have different icons depending on the in on the situation and"
5266700,5273340," stuff like that so yeah um okay so uh let's continue so we we need a different sort of like"
5273340,5278940," levels of icon i kind of want to steal some ideas from youtube um right so at least like"
5278940,5283820," get inspired i'm sorry not steal get inspired so i rise my temple"
5283820,5290220," am i really that obnoxious with my titles holy okay"
5294620,5300780," sometimes yeah so this is what i want uh can can you see what so isn't shut the fuck up"
5300780,5309260," just a second uh right so can you see what is going on so yeah essentially when you hover it just"
5309260,5316300," like becomes like bigger like it it does animation i'm not sure if i want to do animation right now"
5316300,5323740," but how does it look like when they you know expand it okay this is actually kind of cool uh so they"
5323740,5331340," basically invert those things all right so they basically invert those things um i wonder if we"
5331340,5337660," can do the same thing and if it's gonna work well so when i was actually subtracting one shape for"
5337660,5343500," another one i was going for this specific look actually right i was kind of going for this specific"
5343500,5351580," look but it never really worked out never really worked out so i have a couple of ideas on how we can try to"
5351580,5363500," realize that we can try to realize that um okay good so ink escape ink escape i should have maybe started it"
5363500,5375500," slightly differently right so i'm gonna go to resources organs so here's that and i'm gonna do ink escape in here"
5378540,5388060," uh okay so let's give it another try let's give it another try so we're gonna have 100 by 100 so this is"
5388060,5395180," 100 by 100 one of the things we can try to do we can try to convert the um stroke to path"
5396620,5403820," yeah so yeah so what i did that actually turned this into this kind of stuff so the entire path"
5403820,5412140," sort of became like the shape it sort of became the shape right and we can try to work with that"
5412140,5417660," uh we can now try to create this kind of thing right this kind of thing"
5419580,5429100," uh and probably center it uh right so let's not change the size of any of that stuff all right"
5429100,5438540," so and we'll put it like this and i think by doing subtraction uh from this to this um difference"
5438540,5444380," yes that's what yeah i should have actually converted this entire thing to path right away so this is what i"
5444380,5450220," want it okay so that makes a lot of sense yeah now i know how to achieve this kind of stuff okay"
5450220,5458540," so now we have these kinds so it's a little bit uh inconvenient but yeah i think we can work with that"
5458540,5463980," so snapping of inkscape is actually really useful right so because it basically has like it snaps it"
5463980,5468940," to different points like a center point the edge and stuff like that and automatically allows you to just"
5468940,5476620," align things like so uh right so let's actually do subtraction um so difference there we go so and"
5476620,5479820," then uh difference in here there we go"
5479820,5491420," so will google hire me to do ui for youtube because i recreated the youtube full screen icon very easily"
5492460,5505820," easy peasy so and interestingly this is like a single shape but i can't separate that shape"
5505820,5512380," unfortunately right so it's still part of kind of the same thing i could try to oh okay so"
5512380,5522060," that kind of didn't work um so i don't really know how to cut it out uh division all right so"
5523180,5530060," yeah i don't know right so this is a single shape it's not even grouped shape but how can i uh remove"
5530060,5535180," this thing like separate this thing out of that single shape does anybody well do we do we have any"
5535180,5541900," professional inkscapers in the chat do we have any professional inkscapers because if i could i could"
5541900,5549500," quite easily easily easily just do that um just uh take one of the corners and duplicate uh how"
5549500,5558620," do you duplicate uh so i can i can select that and it copy pastes the whole thing all right um"
5558620,5565340," um path to object break apart"
5565340,5567340," um"
5567340,5569340," um"
5569340,5571340," maybe we can"
5571340,5571340," uh"
5571340,5575020," uh try to do that uh try to do that oh"
5575020,5578940," holy who said break apart"
5578940,5584060," thank you so much donksal thank you this is this is genius"
5584060,5584780," okay"
5584780,5588700," so are you a professional inkscaper"
5588700,5596060," or maybe maybe you you know coral draw because as far as i know from the ux point of view uh inkscape"
5596060,5596780," was"
5596780,5603100," inspired very heavily by coral draw so they basically uh copied all of these things uh"
5603100,5603900," right"
5603900,5609740," and by the way if you learn inkscape you basically also know coral draw right they're trying to keep"
5609740,5615900," sort of like u ui ux and flow kind of similar so if you already know coral draw it's very easy for"
5615900,5621420," you to switch to uh to this thing and this is a very useful skill as you can see right it's a very"
5621420,5628220," useful skill and this entire thing works on level sv on of svgs right you can quite easily uh modify"
5628220,5632700," svgs and stuff like that it's like it's it's a very lifesaver tool like i absolutely love it i use"
5632700,5638620," it every day for different things um right and it's absolutely free and it's open source right so if"
5638620,5641820," you want to use it just google up inkscape um yeah"
5641820,5650060," your graphic artist uh coral draw 3.0 okay that's cool okay that makes sense it's kind of cool that the"
5650060,5655980," knowledge is transferable between these two things right it's it's really cool uh so"
5655980,5661100," creator is also trying to do a similar thing with photoshop right so it tries to mimic photoshop"
5661100,5665260," so it's easier for photoshop photoshop users to use creator um"
5665260,5676140," so yes yes in uh include tongue saw in a stream so yeah there you are you are in the stream is that"
5676140,5682140," oh i mean you invite somebody i don't really uh do sort of like a call or calls on the stream uh it's"
5682140,5688940," not my thing sorry i'm a little asocial for this kind of stuff um so okay what i want to do i want"
5688940,5697260," to put this kind of thing in here i suppose so this is going to be zero like that and now we can essentially"
5697260,5705900," create um different versions right so for instance you can always just do this"
5705900,5716540," oh i spilled a little bit of a tea but not too much just a second okay"
5719020,5727260," okay let's not repeat that let's try uh okay uh we're gonna do it like that and we're gonna do it"
5727260,5737260," like that there we go uh almost almost ah and this one is gonna be vertical yeah so now we have this kind"
5737260,5744940," uh we have this kind of thing uh we have this kind of thing uh maybe we can even have"
5744940,5755500," just this thing just one single thing in here and essentially yeah essentially just"
5755500,5762060," animate it procedurally but i'm not sure if it's a good idea generally"
5763260,5765260," not sure if it's a good idea generally"
5765260,5778540," so what would be the best way to have several versions of this entire thing right so i think"
5778540,5787900," i'm gonna abandon this stuff um we may extend maybe we can have like um atlas right we can have an"
5787900,5793100," atlas of these things yeah this is actually a cool idea because then we'll be able to load a"
5793100,5799340," single atlas into the memory and cut it into the texture i think yeah i think this is what quite a"
5799340,5806860," lot of games do and not only games i think web does that as well um right so essentially in web it is"
5806860,5814140," possible to just have a single image as an atlas and then on a level of css cut out a specific icon"
5814140,5819900," right i think it is a thing that web developers do web designers and stuff like that so just a single"
5819900,5826540," atlas and on the css you just cut out specific icon and that kind of works right so we can do a similar"
5826540,5833580," thing in here we can do a similar thing in here so why not because i want to like keep a single stuff"
5833580,5844860," in here so in terms of pixels um right i would like to keep it maybe 380 380 right so that's basically the"
5844860,5861180," the same thing and now this is i want to do pixels right 380 380 okay that's cool so now uh can i"
5862060,5870380," multiply width by two okay so i remember that you you can put like expressions in here and they get"
5870380,5879180," automatically evaluated okay that's fine so now i can essentially just put stuff like that but that also"
5879180,5885660," right as a question so now i want to i want to have a version that is that has some of these things a little"
5885660,5892540," bit inside like this but i need to make it pixel perfect if you know what i mean right so i wanted"
5892540,5899900," to make it pixel perfect i could reduce it like that but that changes the size of the width right that"
5899900,5911020," changes the size of the width so one of the things i can do i can say something like this does it i think i"
5911020,5921820," think it doesn't really work that way yeah so i don't like that it like really scales them i don't like"
5921820,5930060," that it really scales them one of the things we can do we can do this sort of like a stroke style"
5930060,5939820," uh right and we can make it red and no not this red but the surrounding of this thing is red so and let's"
5939820,5947660," place this entire thing somewhere here right let's place this thing somewhere here and that way we can"
5947660,5956620," just make it smaller right we can just make it smaller we can even try to make it like so i'm trying to"
5959180,5971820," make it even sort of speak right so maybe this is going to be uh 35 35 310 310 so and since i can snap"
5971820,5983820," individual things in here i can snap them into this thing i can literally snap it into this thing and that way"
5984380,5989340," i think it's going to be perfect it's going to be pixel perfect"
5989340,5992220," so yeah"
5992220,6000620," so i didn't have to scale any of these things right so i i want to just move them and keep them pixel per"
6000620,6009820," uh right so that's what i wanted to achieve um okay so and now we can quite easily just duplicate this"
6009820,6015580," entire stuff uh right so document properties we can multiply this stuff by two uh like so"
6015580,6022620," boom we have a little bit more stuff in here now um so though we have to be a bit careful"
6024540,6031020," um right because um right because this thing needs to maintain its shape so what if i group"
6031020,6038540," this thing all right and i put it like that uh huh it needs to be snapped"
6039740,6048620," here please can you snap it here please please snap it here it doesn't it doesn't want to what the"
6048620,6062380," fuck all right it to do this angle doesn't snap it god damn all right one of the things we can do"
6063980,6065180," uh we can have"
6065180,6065180," uh we can have"
6065180,6076460," oh it's it's not even working perfectly anymore okay so we can have the second one which is let's say"
6076460,6086780," is green and it's going to be the size of 380 380 all right so that way i can finally copy paste this"
6086780,6095420," entire stuff and move it here so it snaps like this which makes it super easy okay so right i use extra"
6095420,6100540," shapes to guide me through all of that right so that's essentially what i do i can do it like that"
6101500,6119660," hv right so this is hv hv hv hv hv hv hv and the same thing for these things hv hv hv hv"
6119660,6130620," uh so there we go so but i suppose we kind of need to swap these things so this is going to be"
6130620,6136460," sort of like um a regional thing so i need to go to youtube"
6136460,6143980," uh let me save everything in here let me just save it and let's go to try kotlin"
6143980,6155020," so people don't know what i'm doing i'm just doing the the icons so if i extend it you probably can't see"
6155820,6165180," uh what's going on all right so in here uh so it actually is bigger and it's just like doing it like"
6165180,6172460," that okay we'll see what we can do so just doing animations it's just doing animations"
6173740,6184620," uh all right so this one is in terms of pixels what is its size uh 310 uh 380 okay 310 and 380 that's fine"
6185900,6194300," uh i might as well maybe yeah keep it outside somewhere here keep it outside because i think"
6194300,6198540," it's going to be useful in the future but for now we can have this like atlas"
6199420,6201500," out of which we're going to be cutting out things"
6201500,6216860," all right so let me open it like that okay so then we can do uh convert"
6217420,6227340," the background none uh full screen um svg full screen png all right so there we go so this is what"
6227340,6230300," we have in here um so"
6230300,6241100," i can now have the following thing when i'm creating a texture can i cut out the texture i think i cannot"
6242060,6249500," um the first looks very youtube you maybe it does like it's kind of inspired it's kind of heavily"
6249500,6259900," inspired by youtube uh so that's for sure uh i think we cut out during the drawing draw texture xc or"
6259900,6266860," maybe a draw texture uh profession okay so here it is so draw a part of the texture defined by a rectangle"
6266860,6273900," with the pro parameters right whatever that means um so you provide the texture you provide the source"
6273900,6279020," rectangle and then the destination rectangle and then you provide origin for rotation we don't plan"
6279020,6283420," to rotate anything in the tint so we'll probably have to do this kind of thing right so we'll probably"
6283420,6292380," have to do this kind of things okay so this is the plugin uh and let me let me see so full screen"
6292940,6298940," image uh should i call it like that i think i'm gonna preserve this kind of stuff the only difference"
6298940,6307100," here is going to be how exactly we render this entire stuff so that's basically what we render"
6307100,6318620," so we can try okay we can try to just um run it and see how laughable it looks like right so because"
6318620,6323980," it's not a square anymore right so it's a rectangle and it's a full atlas but we don't need full atlas"
6323980,6329820," i just want to see how like uh how it looks like i think it's gonna be fun uh right so i'm gonna just"
6329820,6334700," start the mutualizer uh there we go so let's put it here yeah"
6334700,6343820," i mean not bad i guess right so it's it's the whole atlas there right"
6346620,6352460," uh that's so funny right because it used to be like a single thing now it's like we have several"
6352460,6362380," of them so that's fine that's fine uh right so let's go to the um to the pro parameters to the pro"
6362380,6371740," parameters so we provide the texture uh so that's the texture so what's going to be the source uh the"
6371740,6379660," source uh i'm going to use collateral for now um let me be let's create source uh separately source"
6379660,6389420," so first one is 380 380 we know exact dimensions of these things so we can just use that"
6389420,6395180," in terms of the destination in terms of the destination this one is interesting"
6399260,6407100," because um so this allows us to stretch things but we don't really plan to stretch"
6407100,6415340," so let's use destination as this so this becomes a rectangle uh this is the destination so this is x"
6415340,6422060," and y for the destination and then we have to define width and height and width and height is something like"
6422060,6429820," this right width and height is something like this but not really so the actual width and height is gonna be"
6429820,6444620," 380 uh 380 and this is a full screen button um 380. so we kind of need to save uh icon size in here"
6445580,6452540," um it's a little bit of a magical number but i'm gonna factor it out a little bit later somehow trust me"
6452540,6459420," i'm gonna do that at some point so and we can maybe even use something like this icon size"
6459420,6467500," icon size so we just pick that as an icon size like the main icon size um all right so origin doesn't really"
6467500,6480300," matter i can just set uh colliderial um vector vector vector two zero zero rotation uh but the tint is going"
6480300,6488460," going to be that all right so we already have a tint um yes yes yes yes yes okay"
6488460,6500620," so we can just do that so i wonder if um i could factor out some of these things"
6501980,6507340," uh yes factor out some of these things and yes yes yes yes yes"
6507340,6517660," uh that's funny okay so that's cool so let's just try to maybe i should have not actually uh"
6517660,6522060," closed it right because we don't really need to reload anything anymore"
6522060,6525580," right so we don't need to reload anything anymore"
6527260,6534620," uh so what we need ah so i see what's going on in here uh so we have to replace"
6534620,6541580," this stuff with icon size and icon size"
6541580,6556860," all right all right and okay so that at least put it there uh but now the scaling is kind of off i think"
6557980,6564140," uh so uh uh uh do we still use width and height of"
6564140,6568220," of some things that we're not supposed to use i don't know"
6568220,6573820," why it is like half of this entire stuff so maybe i have to do something like this"
6573820,6580140," yeah so something is fishing that is for sure"
6581980,6589180," that is for sure so we are adjusting icon size to this specific scale"
6589180,6595900," oh okay so i see yeah that's actually true that's actually true that makes so much sense"
6598700,6604780," good that looks so much better actually"
6604780,6617500," i like how it looks like okay so now uh what i'd like to have uh i'd like to have some sort of a"
6617500,6626460," parameter that let's uh let's uh let's uh speak the the icon in fact how we can pick an icon right so"
6626460,6634220," this is the icon 0 right so we can even have this as an index um right so and i'm gonna just say size index"
6634220,6646940," index 0 uh yep and i'm gonna essentially refresh so now i can modify that index i modify that specific"
6646940,6654380," index and say one all right and there we go it's the next one you you can probably see that can you"
6654380,6661660," you can see that yeah you can see that it's the next one then two uh right refresh and this is next one"
6661660,6671340," so uh essentially we we now have indices right so now now we have indices and we can actually accept"
6671340,6681100," that specific index as a parameter of the whole thing right so size icon index right so index uh icon index"
6682220,6687500," so this is a spreadsheet yeah this is essentially a spreadsheet so and in here when you are in full"
6687500,6693500," screen uh you probably want to see the index too uh right and when you are not in a full screen you"
6693500,6698220," probably want to see the index zero right so we have intermediate indices but i we didn't find the"
6698220,6704220," usage for them yet right so now look at that chat so"
6708460,6714300," pretty cool pretty cool um so yeah"
6714300,6726540," and to be fair to be fair um i kind of want when i hover i want to use index one"
6726540,6737260," and when uh like i hover here i want to use index uh three right so essentially i think it should not be"
6737260,6744700," really really an index uh per se it should be some sort of like enumeration maybe even boolean right so"
6744700,6752540," full uh screen screen button right so um"
6752540,6763020," essentially it's are we full screen or not so how should i call that parameter uh how should i call that"
6763020,6769420," parameter full screen or not full screen to be fair we can get that information from the uh from this"
6769420,6779260," thing directly but i don't really want to do that enable nah um so essentially yeah how do you call this thing so"
6781500,6795020," uh toggle on toggle off toggle on toggle off toggle on it's kind of difficult one it is in fact a kind"
6795020,6799820," of a difficult one so i'll have to think since we have an access directly to the plugin maybe it doesn't"
6799820,6811100," really matter that much uh because we can always sort of like pick yeah for example here we know whether"
6811100,6822380," there there is a hover over or not uh right so we can work with that so boolean hover over so by default is going to be false"
6822380,6837660," if we are inside hover over hover over is going to be true otherwise false and the color basically depends"
6837660,6852140," hover over and just use that color in here otherwise use the background color right so that makes it relatively"
6852940,6863980," easy to work easy to work like this okay and yeah essentially we can split in here we can do the split"
6863980,6876780," uh if you are p is full screen right if you are in full screen and if you are not in full screen if you are in hover over"
6876780,6881100," hover over on and if you are not in hover over so something like this"
6881100,6891500," so there is four situations if you are in full screen right now and you are in hover over"
6891500,6901020," uh to be fair it would be nice to invert that so we're not in full screen and right now is not hover over so that means"
6901340,6910620," uh uh icon index is gonna be zero right it's gonna be zero if it's hover over it's gonna be one so if"
6910620,6919740," it's full screen and not hover over it's gonna be two and then three so maybe so this is binary counting"
6919740,6922140," right so this is essentially binary counting maybe we can make"
6922140,6928780," bits of that index out of these flags but that's going to be unreadable i think"
6928780,6938060," we could make um index out of these bits because it's only four states but i mean this is more explicit"
6938060,6945740," i think i think this is more explicit and here we can have icon uh index right so icon index"
6946700,6953980," and let's not accept that as a parameter now uh all right so what do i have in here so yeah we do not"
6953980,6954620," accept that"
6954620,6960700," all right"
6960700,6974060," i think it's still kind of i feel like it still changes the the width but it actually doesn't"
6976220,6981740," right"
6981740,6990140," so is it good is it good is it gucci is it tamaguchi um"
6990140,6999020," so maybe this should expand and this should can yeah so i think we need to swap"
6999020,7003260," these two things are we really need to swap them"
7005660,7014220," right so what i want to do in here it is take this entire stuff then this entire stuff i can even group"
7014220,7020140," them uh and then this entire stuff put it in here"
7020140,7027580," something like this so that's what i want to do"
7028860,7035980," and then i'm going to go into the resources icons and convert super quick"
7035980,7040860," so let's close mutualizing"
7040860,7045820," of course just in case we want to rebuild into anything"
7050860,7054860," and right and right so"
7054860,7062540," yeah in full screen it goes like this yeah"
7062540,7067500," that's pretty cool"
7074140,7078460," and if you idle for long enough when you are in full screen it will disappear"
7078460,7084700," it disappears and you can't press it anymore until you actually move a little bit"
7084700,7087100," so that's pretty cool"
7087100,7097260," so you may argue that maybe it actually expands too much i feel like it expands my but maybe not too"
7097260,7097900," much actually"
7097900,7108380," uh wasn't easier to change the index number instead of editing the image not really as already said what i"
7108380,7116780," i wanted to do uh one of the things i wanted to do i wanted to construct the index out of the bits of this entire stuff"
7116780,7120380," uh right so let me let me demonstrate you what i wanted to do"
7121340,7129340," so this is uh one zero so this is the lowest uh bit and this is the highest bit so essentially what we"
7129340,7141660," can do uh we can take this then this uh right and then move it to one right move by one bit and there"
7141660,7145100," and then do something like this and remove this entire stuff"
7145100,7150140," uh right so that's what we could have done but i think it's too unreadable"
7152060,7155660," it didn't really work the way i expected so maybe let's actually swap the bits"
7155660,7162780," so i think it has to be maybe p full screen and then hover over"
7162780,7167500," something like this so that's what i wanted kind of to do"
7167500,7176300," yeah so and if you are changing the indices it's kind of difficult to pull off that trick"
7176940,7181660," i really don't want to do this because it's too smart ass you know what i mean"
7181660,7186780," it's too smart as like somebody's going to be reading this and it's like what the is this how am"
7186780,7193660," i supposed to understand that all right so it's kind of cool right it's it boosts your ego but at the"
7193660,7205980," same time like so yeah i kind of i'm kind of want to leave it as this right it's it's kind of copy pasty"
7205980,7208060," but the same time it's extremely explicit"
7212540,7220220," it's extremely explicit so yeah i'm gonna leave it as it is all right so uh and yeah i forgot to"
7220220,7230540," create the index uh icon index there we go it's pretty cool it's pretty cool uh yeah an actual legit"
7230540,7237260," button uh for going full screen and it feels like a proper button right so it acts like in in modern ui"
7237260,7244380," it disappears and stuff like that uh right maybe we can make this thing disappear a little bit more"
7244380,7252300," pretty in a sense that like a fade away uh right so we could try to do that but i mean that's already"
7252300,7256860," streaming for more than two hours right so i'm registering for more than two hours and i think"
7256860,7263020," uh the time has come to wrap it up right so the time has come to wrap it up i'm gonna quickly"
7263820,7270540," just uh you know commit everything that we have in here to be fair to be fair like we i'm gonna commit"
7270540,7278220," the final rendered resource uh but maybe it would make sense to actually include that in a build tool"
7278220,7284780," so we have a like a logo a thing that builds a logo out of the svg so maybe it would make sense to"
7286620,7297020," um to add the command in here uh right so here we are yeah we're just building several things"
7297020,7302540," not sure how good of an idea that is all right i'm gonna i'm gonna extend the build a little bit"
7302540,7310940," later so for now i'm gonna just like commit um add full screen button all right so we added the full"
7310940,7321500," screen button there we go the feature has been implemented uh right uh and yeah two hours two"
7321500,7327660," hours you may say that you can implement that faster in react but can you implement that as fast"
7327660,7335340," as i did while entertaining hundreds of people on twitch and constantly talking and explaining everything"
7335340,7342780," and also drawing the icons yourself can you implement that in two hours doing the same thing but in react"
7342780,7348300," you can say that you can do that in react faster but you're going to be sitting at your home nobody's"
7348300,7352060," going to be watching you nobody's going to be distracting you nobody's going to be trolling you"
7352060,7357260," you won't have to explain anything to anybody but i have to do all that stuff and it took me two hours"
7357260,7366220," to implement it i think so yeah anyways i guess that's it for today thanks everyone who's watching right"
7366220,7372620," now i really appreciate that have a good one and i see you all on the next recreational programming session"
7372620,7377020," with azuzin uh love you all um"
