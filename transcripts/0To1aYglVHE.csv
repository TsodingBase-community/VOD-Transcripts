160,6000," Are we live? Looks like we're live. Hello everyone and welcome to yet another"
6000,11280," recreational programming session with Azurzi. Let's make a little bit of announcement and"
11280,20560," officially start the stream as usual, as usual. So let's do the Red Circle live on Twitch and"
20560,31040," what are we doing today on twitch.at television website? Today we are doing Raylib plus FFmPack."
31040,35520," How about that? So I'm going to give the link to where we're doing all that twitch.tv/sodding"
35520,39760," and I'm going to ping everyone who's interested in being pinged. Their goal is stream has officially"
39760,46160," started. So have you guys seen the latest Musializer? Do you guys watch the offline sessions"
46160,54400," on Sodding Daily? Do you do all of that? Look what kind of we have now. Look at that. Look at that, Shaisa."
54400,60080," I hope the encoding is not completely ruined, but you get the idea."
60080,72960," You know, there's something even more epic. So this is not the most epic actually song that you can play"
72960,80480," in here. You can do shit like that. Right. So let's actually put my favorite sample of all time from"
80480,95600," Null. It's just an obstacle in my way and it's the first sample. This is my favorite sample so far."
95600,105280," It repeats actually. So the Musializer basically repeats all of the samples that you put in there."
105280,113120," So yeah, that's basically the state of Musializer. But unfortunately, right now, the only thing you can do"
113120,127120," with this Musializer is just like look at this visualization. And it's just like that means it's just a glorified like a Windows media player. And Windows media player even had like a even better visualizations. So you know what we need to have?"
127120,134640," We need to have we need to have an ability to render that into an actual video in full HD, 60 fps,"
134640,141360," battery smooth, so you can upload it on all of your social media platforms, get shit ton of likes and shit ton of external"
141360,155120," validation. That's the main goal of this tool. In fact, the main goal of this tool is not just visualize and look at it, but actually produce videos, high quality videos of that visualization."
155120,168800," And so that you can like basically post-process it or maybe upload it as it is and stuff like that. So that's kind of the main goal."
168800,177840," That's kind of the main goal. That's kind of the main goal. And this is exactly what you need to do, but you can post-process it, or maybe upload it as it is, and stuff like that."
177840,191840," So that's kind of the main goal. That's kind of the main goal. And this is exactly what we're going to do today. Right. So, luckily, with FFMPEG, it's relatively easy. We've already done something like that."
191840,201840," Right. And we're going to revisit that specifically today. And I even created a separate repo for that. I just remembered, like right before the stream, I remember that I created separate repo."
201840,210840," So there is a complete example that demonstrates how to do that. Right. I'm going to copy-paste it in the chat. And of course, it's going to be in the description as well."
210840,226840," So, and this entire thing just does that. Unfortunately, it doesn't even have a video. Maybe this is something that we can do on today's stream, just like render a video that this thing sort of demonstrates and just like put it in here because GitHub recently allowed you to upload videos there."
226840,237840," So, I think it would make sense. And you know what's cool about this specific example? It uses Olive C to render videos. Right. It generates each individual frame with Olive C and it just passes it to FFMPEG."
237840,253840," And FFMPEG does all of the encoding and produces the video and stuff like that. So, it doesn't use Raylib. Right. So, the new thing that we need to figure out today is to how to, I suppose, grab the image of Raylib window and pass it to FFMPEG."
253840,258840," FFMPEG. So, this is like a novel thing that we'll need to, you know, explore today."
258840,270840," And in fact, we developed this entire thing on the stream. Maybe I should put like the link to the stream in here, but the link to the stream where we developed this entire thing is going to be in the description, of course."
270840,283840," And for people who are in the chat, I'm going to paste it in the chat. It's basically one of the, you know, machine learning in C episodes where we basically rendered video out of the model that we trained. Right."
283840,296840," So, we trained the model to interpolate between two images at upscaled resolution and we generated like interpolation as a smooth video. Right. And we use FFMPEG to do that. So, this is basically what we did."
296840,307840," So, already. People are subscribing like crazy. Thank you so much, Reako, for tier one subscription with the message. Nice. Nice. It is indeed."
307840,318840," Marcio Netta. Thank you so much for tier one subscription with the message. Has it been 12 months already? Thanks for the all, for all of the amazing projects. It really helps keep programming fresh."
318840,326840," You're welcome. Right. You're welcome. So, this is one of the probably reasons why I quit the industry, because industry kind of kills all of your passion about programming."
326840,334840," You cannot maintain passion about programming while you're working in industry. So, you have to do that from the outside, unfortunately."
334840,345840," And what's interesting is that, like, this industry would not be even possible without passionate people like us. Because, like, nobody would want to do this kind of shit. Right."
345840,357840," Like, honestly, programming is horrible. It is absolutely horrible. It's a mental torture. Unless you are actually passionate about it, you won't fucking do that."
357840,370840," No matter how much money, like, they will pay you, you have to be passionate about this shit to actually withstand the mental damage that you endure. Right. So, you have to be passionate. Right."
370840,387840," And this industry does not even respect passionate people. Right. It just uses them up and throws them away. Right. The next passionate students from the CS University are going to come in, we're going to squeeze out of them and then we're going to take the next ones and the next ones and the next ones."
387840,400840," So, this is how the industry sort of perpetuates itself. It's just like very, very much cannibalistic and devours all the, you know, enthusiastic people and throw them outside of the industry and they never come back."
400840,416840," Which creates an interesting problem in itself. Right. Because there is a lot of passionate people, but there is not enough passionate and competent people. Right. Because as soon as you become competent in this industry, you stop being passionate."
416840,429840," And that may create a problem that may blow up in the future. We really need not only just passionate people, but also competent ones. Yikes. Yikes. Yikes."
429840,439840," Yikes. Yikes. Voidmain, Jers, thank you so much for tier one subscription with the message. Thank you so much for entertaining and teaching us how to write characters in the text editor and make it fun. Sure. Right."
439840,452840," I'm just a huge language model that looks at the prefix of characters and just makes a decision. What's the most probable character is going to be next and picks it randomly to keep it interesting."
452840,457840," So that's that's how I code. That's literally how the human brain works. Kappa."
457840,465840," Kappa. So thank you so much, AppioEcho for tier one subscription with the message. Hello. Hi, hi, hi."
465840,467840," So Yusu, Yusu, Yusu."
467840,485840," So let's take a look at this example that renders videos in C with FFM pack. So I don't really remember how it even works. But what I remember, it creates FFM pack as a separate process and then establishes the pipe between your current process and FFM pack."
485840,495840," FFM pack and sends the frames over that pipe and FFM pack just like compresses those frames. I mean, encodes them and turns them into like an actual video."
495840,503840," So let's go ahead and do that. I think I already have it somewhere here. So maybe FFM pack. Oh, no, I do not have it. That's that's bizarre."
503840,513840," So it actually starts with rendering. No, it still exists. Bizarre. Bizarre minded from the actually bizarre. So let's actually do cloning."
513840,523840," All right. So we cloned this entire stuff and let's go there and let's try to build this entire thing and see. But that's it. So that's how much time it took to build this entire example."
523840,533840," Look at that. Can your Rust do that? Look at the time. Look at the look at the time. One hundred milliseconds. Can your Rust do that?"
533840,543840," I don't think so. So let's go ahead and just run it and see. OK, so it started FFM pack and apparently it is rendering things and it finished rendering."
543840,557840," All right. So that's pretty cool. So what we have in here, we have output MP4. So and let's see what is output MP4."
557840,569840," So yeah, we generated that video from C using all of C. Right. And then we fed the frames into FFM pack and FFM pack created the final video."
569840,577840," So this is how I want to basically record the result of the visualizer. Right. So that's basically how we want to do that."
577840,585840," So let's take a look at how it looks internally. Right. So let's go to rendering video in FFM pack."
585840,595840," All right. So we have this entire thing. All right. So we are creating the pipes. We are forking the current process."
595840,605840," Then within the child process, we are establishing the pipe. Right. So essentially, we're just like connecting standard input and the pipe that we created."
605840,611840," And then we're starting FFM packs with shit tone of flags. So that's what we're doing in here."
611840,621840," We're starting FFM pack with shit on the flags. Right. And essentially, yeah, essentially, then we are initializing all of C canvas."
621840,631840," And we're starting the process of rendering each individual frame. And as we render each individual frame, we're sending that frame over the pipe to FFM pack."
631840,642840," And we do that for the duration. Right. So duration is 10. We're multiplying it by FPS. So that means we're doing that for 10 seconds. Right. We're generating 10 second sort of video."
642840,652840," And within that video, we're like literally simulating bounce in the circle off of the walls. Right. And we're just like sending the actual frames to FFM pack."
652840,661840," After that, we're closing that pipe and we're waiting until FFM pack done rendering things. And that's basically, that's the entire example."
661840,676840," So the most sort of like difficult part here is creating a pipe forking the process and then connecting that pipe with the child process and just running FFM pack and figuring out the like all of the flags and stuff like that."
676840,691840," And what I remember really struggling with this example, especially when it came to flags of FFM pack, because flags of FFM pack is just like a separate torture. It's a separate circle of hell. Right."
691840,707840," It's just like it is so weird. So essentially, the order of the flags doesn't matter until it does. So it doesn't matter and matters at the same time."
707840,715840," So it is so weird. Like I'm telling you, it is so weird. But recently, I think I figured out."
715840,728840," So the secret, the secret formula of FFM P flags, I think I did. Right. So if you go into the FFM pack official website, so there is a documentation and stuff like that. So it's actually fine."
728840,748840," So, uh, so I think it's basically like the first thing that you want to see FFM pack, uh, description, uh, I think somewhere here. Yeah, this is the most, this is basically the description of how, uh, FFM pack flags work. Right."
748840,761840," So, uh, let me actually put that in the description on, uh, in the YouTube video. Right. So FFM pack, uh, documentation, documentation, and this is basically, basically the thing."
761840,770840," So let me go ahead and just like copy paste it. Uh, I just wanted to copy paste that specific line so I can do it in here. Right."
770840,785840," So first come the global options. First come the global options. Then you have to specify the input file options, the input file options."
785840,798840," And basically, uh, after the input file options, you have to specify dash I and the input URL. So dash I is one of the most important flags."
798840,823840," It's sort of the separator between input and output. Right. Between input and output. Uh, right. As soon as you specify the input, all of the flags that are related to input before are just applied to that specific input and reset."
823840,836840," So you apply flags in FFM pack in chunks. So here's the first chunks of the flags and it ends at providing the input file. And it sort of collapses into that single chunk."
836840,850840," We provided the input with these parameters. Then you continue by providing the output parameters in a similar fashion, in a similar fashion. And the list of the output parameters finishes."
850840,865840," We provided the output URL, but look how there's no, uh, similar, like minus all, uh, flag for the output URL. This is because the output URL is decided by looking at the argument."
865840,872840," And if it doesn't look, uh, like any of the known arguments, it is considered a URL for the output."
872840,884840," So this is how it works, but wait, there is more. You can have several inputs and several outputs."
884840,897840," So yeah. It does make sense, but it's not intuitive unless you actually sit down and start reading this goddamn documentation."
897840,903840," It's not something that you can just like pick it up. Like you have to actually know this schema. It's not intuitive."
903840,908840," Like you need somebody to explain you or maybe read it somewhere. Just like you cannot pick it up."
908840,919840," So yeah, that's basically how it works. That's why like within this single chunk, the order of the arguments doesn't really matter."
919840,925840," I hope. Maybe there are some cases where within that chunk, they do matter."
925840,929840," But as soon as you like finish that chunk, like this is where it starts to matter."
929840,933840," So the, uh, the order of the argument doesn't matter until it does."
933840,940840," And also like a global parameters are like a special kind that can be provided at the beginning."
940840,947840," So it's just like, uh, so yeah, but it can make sense. It can make sense. You're going to get used to that."
947840,954840," So that's basically what it all means."
954840,959840," And now all of a sudden this mess starts to make sense. Right."
959840,969840," So, uh, log level, uh, and, uh, yes, right. Yes. Basically automatically answers yes to any of the questions that FFMPAC may want to ask, right."
969840,973840," In case of, for example, it, uh, it is about to rewrite already existing file."
973840,975840," It may ask you, do you really want to rewrite it?"
975840,982840," So if you provide, uh, dash, why it always answers yes to any of the questions that it may potentially ask. Right."
982840,985840," So these two are global parameters of FFMPAC."
985840,992840," So that means that everything, uh, that comes after that is some sort of input parameters that ends with providing the input."
992840,994840," And this is our first chunk."
994840,999840," So what we're doing here, we say that the format of the input is going to be a raw video."
999840,1002840," The pixel format is going to be RGBA."
1002840,1004840," The resolution is going to be the resolution that we provided."
1004840,1007840," And then FPS, we don't have any sound."
1007840,1011840," And the actual input is dash, which means standard input."
1011840,1017840," So essentially what we're describing in here, we're describing that we're receiving raw frames from the standard input, right."
1017840,1020840," So, and then we're connecting standard input to the pipe."
1020840,1027840," And, uh, in a parent, parent application where we're generating frame, we're sending those raw frames to that pipe."
1027840,1031840," And FFMPAC receives that from the standard input and it just like encodes that."
1031840,1033840," Um, so yeah."
1033840,1037840," So after that, uh, we get the output parameters and the output parameters."
1037840,1041840," We just say that the codec for the video is going to be lib x264."
1041840,1043840," It's basically h264."
1043840,1046840," Uh, and the output file name is output mp4."
1046840,1047840," And that's basically it."
1047840,1054840," So as soon as you know the schema of the FFMPAC parameters, like all of that starts to make sense all of a sudden."
1054840,1056840," Just like, yeah, yeah, it makes sense."
1056840,1059840," Uh, if you didn't know that, it doesn't make sense."
1059840,1064840," You, you wouldn't know why, for example, if you swap these two parameters, it's going to error out."
1064840,1066840," Like you wouldn't know that."
1066840,1070840," Like why this is okay, but like this is not okay, but this is okay."
1070840,1073840," At the same time, swapping these two is not okay."
1073840,1074840," You see what I'm talking about?"
1074840,1077840," Like some, the order of some of the parameters matter."
1077840,1079840," The order of other parameters doesn't matter."
1079840,1082840," And if you deal with that for the first time, it's just like so fucking confusing."
1082840,1087840," Unless somebody told you about this schema, this grand schema that you have to follow."
1087840,1089840," So this is the chunk of the input parameters."
1089840,1092840," This is the chunk of the output parameters and so on and so forth."
1092840,1101840," Uh, so hopefully now, you know, so, and maybe you're going to avoid all of the frustrations that I had, uh, with this tool, right?"
1101840,1105840," So as soon as you understand the schema, all like a lot of frustration just goes away."
1105840,1106840," You, you go like, ah, okay."
1106840,1107840," So that finally makes sense."
1107840,1108840," Uh, right."
1108840,1109840," Uh, okay."
1109840,1110840," Uh, okay guys."
1110840,1111840," So we've got some subs."
1111840,1112840," Uh, all right."
1112840,1113840," Uh, thank you so much, uh, Azeros for Twitch Prime with the message."
1113840,1114840," Yeah."
1114840,1130840," I have the same experience with AT industry just overworks you and speeds you back out."
1130840,1134840," On another note, uh, will there be any more NN.h videos?"
1134840,1135840," We'll see."
1135840,1136840," We'll see."
1136840,1140840," So I want to finish Visualizer first and then I want to finish Google."
1140840,1142840," Uh, Google is basically finished to be fair."
1142840,1149840," Like, uh, as soon as I finish Visualizer, I'll look at Google and see if there's anything like left to stream."
1149840,1153840," There's obviously some, something left to do, but not everything is interesting to stream."
1153840,1154840," Right."
1154840,1157840," And I may go back to NN.h."
1157840,1158840," We'll see."
1158840,1159840," We'll see how it goes."
1159840,1160840," Uh, MB Ilyanov."
1160840,1162840," Thank you so much for tier one subscription."
1162840,1163840," Uh, Chimeon."
1163840,1165840," Thank you so much for tier one subscription with the message."
1165840,1166840," Tsojin appoging."
1166840,1167840," And metysf777."
1167840,1170840," Thank you so much for tier one, uh, with the message."
1170840,1172840," Thanks for letting me know about FFMPEG schema."
1172840,1173840," You're welcome."
1173840,1175840," I hope it was useful."
1175840,1176840," Right."
1176840,1177840," I don't know."
1177840,1180840," So for, for people who work with FFMPEG all the time, it might be obvious."
1180840,1181840," Right."
1181840,1184840," It's when you work for the first time, it's like really not obvious."
1184840,1187840," It's really, really not obvious."
1187840,1188840," Hmm."
1188840,1189840," All right."
1189840,1196840," So, um, let's try to integrate this thing with RayLib, because we want to be able to actually"
1196840,1198840," render the RayLib stuff."
1198840,1206840," Um, so let's go ahead and maybe include, uh, RayLib in here."
1206840,1209840," And here is an interesting thing."
1209840,1213840," This entire sort of thing, this entire piece of code, we're probably going to copy paste"
1213840,1215840," it to, um, to mutualize it."
1215840,1218840," It uses a lot of Linux specific stuff."
1218840,1221840," So, which means that this stuff is not going to work on windows."
1221840,1227840," So for win on windows, we'll have to integrate with the FFMPEG slightly differently, but as"
1227840,1229840," far as I know, it's pretty much the same, right?"
1229840,1230840," It's pretty much the same."
1230840,1231840," Right."
1231840,1232840," It's pretty much the same."
1232840,1238840," You can quite easily create the pipe and then you can sort of like pass that pipe as a standard"
1238840,1239840," input for the child process."
1239840,1241840," There is some stuff for that on, in win API."
1241840,1246840," And in fact, I use that to implement no build piping."
1246840,1247840," Right."
1247840,1252840," So for those who never heard about this thing, I have like a custom build tool."
1252840,1258840," It's sort of an extra experiment and it can pipe stuff on windows as well."
1258840,1265840," Uh, so we may try to look into that and see how piping is done on windows and do a similar"
1265840,1267840," thing on windows for FFMPEG."
1267840,1268840," Right."
1268840,1270840," So I'm going to paste it in here."
1270840,1273840," And also I'm going to put that in the description."
1273840,1276840," So, uh, sodding, no build."
1276840,1283840," So just in case you're interested in this kind of stuff, just in case you're interested."
1283840,1284840," Um, all right."
1284840,1286840," So we are integrating with the RayLib."
1286840,1294840," So in here we are just creating, uh, the pipe and we're starting the rendering."
1294840,1299840," So I suppose we're going to disable this entire piece of code."
1299840,1300840," Right."
1300840,1303840," Uh, and just do something like this."
1303840,1304840," Right."
1304840,1309840," I'm going to be switching between sort of like Olive C mode and, uh, the RayLib mode."
1309840,1313840," I'm going to init, um, init window."
1313840,1314840," Right."
1314840,1316840," I'm initializing, initializing the window."
1316840,1317840," So do we have width and height?"
1317840,1319840," I think we do have width and height."
1319840,1320840," Yeah."
1320840,1321840," So there's a global parameter here, width and height."
1321840,1324840," So we're going to use that width, uh, height."
1324840,1327840," Uh, so RayLib plus FFMPEG."
1327840,1329840," So that's going to be the title."
1329840,1332840," Um, so we're going to set target FPS."
1332840,1335840," So let's say it's going to be 60."
1335840,1343840," And while, uh, while window shoot close actually should not close."
1343840,1348840," Uh, we're going to begin drawing while we're drawing."
1348840,1350840," We're going to clean the background."
1350840,1353840," We're going to set the background to be, uh, black for now."
1353840,1354840," Right."
1354840,1355840," So, and then I'm going to end drawing."
1355840,1360840," It is very important to do begin drawing and end drawing, because in end drawing, as far"
1360840,1364840," as you know, there is a, uh, like there is a handling of the events."
1364840,1365840," Right."
1365840,1370840," So if you don't do end drawing, at least like once in the frame, um, you won't receive any"
1370840,1372840," actual inputs from, from the user."
1372840,1377840," So you won't be able to even close your window because the stuff that is checked by window should"
1377840,1378840," close is not updated."
1378840,1381840," It is only updated in the end drawing."
1381840,1382840," Right."
1382840,1386840," It's not particularly obvious, but if you follow this sort of schema of Raylib, it kind of works."
1386840,1387840," Right."
1387840,1388840," It just works."
1388840,1390840," And then we're going to close the window."
1390840,1391840," Um, right."
1391840,1394840," So funnily enough, that should just work."
1394840,1395840," That should just work."
1395840,1398840," So let me try to rebuild this entire thing."
1398840,1404840," Um, so it cannot find Raylib because we need to actually build with Raylib now."
1404840,1405840," Right."
1405840,1406840," We have to build with Raylib."
1406840,1411840," So maybe I'm going to just take these flags and put them into C flags like so."
1411840,1413840," So this is going to be C flags."
1413840,1419840," Uh, and here we're going to have package config C flags Raylib."
1419840,1423840," Uh, so for the Raylib, we'll probably also have to have libraries."
1423840,1424840," Uh huh."
1424840,1426840," So this is going to be libs, right?"
1426840,1428840," Because we need to link with the Raylib."
1428840,1430840," It's not enough to just include the headers from the Raylib."
1430840,1432840," You need to link with this kind of stuff."
1432840,1434840," It's not a header only library."
1434840,1435840," Uh, right."
1435840,1439840," It contains the, you know, static libraries that you need to link with."
1439840,1446840," In our case, we're using dynamic library for Raylib because we need to be able to hot reload with our mutualizer."
1446840,1447840," Right."
1447840,1453840," So, and to be able to like easily do that, it's better to have Raylib as a, also as a dynamic library."
1453840,1454840," Um, right."
1454840,1456840," And this seems to be working."
1456840,1457840," Okay."
1457840,1461840," So let me try to run main and it seems to be working as well."
1461840,1469840," So as far as I know, FFM back is currently actually waiting for the frames, but since Raylib doesn't really send anything, it is not receiving any frames."
1469840,1474840," So because of that, yeah, it was just waiting for the frames, but it didn't receive anything."
1474840,1475840," Right."
1475840,1477840," So it received zero packets, zero bytes."
1477840,1479840," And yeah, that's it."
1479840,1483840," So it was just like, yeah, it didn't receive anything."
1483840,1488840," We can take a look at, uh, what actually got rendered, but I didn't think, yeah, it's nothing."
1488840,1489840," It doesn't even play anything."
1489840,1491840," It's just like, it's a, it's an empty video."
1491840,1492840," Right."
1492840,1501840," So to actually have something there, we need to constantly send something over this specific pipe, over this specific pipe."
1501840,1507840," So let's try to replicate the, um, the animation, right?"
1507840,1509840," Let's try to replicate this animation."
1509840,1511840," So we have these parameters of the animation."
1511840,1514840," So X, Y is basically the position of the circle, right?"
1514840,1516840," So that bounce off of the edges and stuff like that."
1516840,1518840," And radius is the radius of the circle."
1518840,1520840," DX, DY is the velocity."
1520840,1523840," DT is the FPS, I suppose."
1523840,1527840," We can move all of that stuff, all of these parameters outside of this conditional compilation."
1527840,1532840," So it is applied for both Raylib and Olive C version of this test."
1532840,1533840," Right."
1533840,1536840," And in fact, we can do this logic."
1536840,1542840," We can literally copy paste this entire logic to, I suppose, here, like literally copy paste it in here."
1542840,1544840," So that's the logic now."
1544840,1555840," And the only things that we need to port in here actually, uh, fill the entire background and draw a circle at X and Y with this specific radius."
1555840,1556840," So that's it."
1556840,1559840," That's going to be the entire porting, so to speak."
1559840,1564840," So filling this thing is effectively clear background, right?"
1564840,1571840," So we essentially need to clear, uh, background, uh, with this color, which is rather weird, right?"
1571840,1578840," So this is an immediate value, but I need to reinterpret it as a color, right?"
1578840,1583840," So because the clear background, let me show you, this is a kind of interesting situation."
1583840,1590840," So, uh, clear background, it accepts color, which is a structure, right?"
1590840,1595840," Color, which is a structure, but it's a structure with four fields of single byte."
1595840,1598840," So it's four bytes structure."
1598840,1601840," And the color that I pass in here is also four bytes."
1601840,1605840," I actually encode each individual component of the color within the byte."
1605840,1612840," So technically, if I just take this sequence of bits and reinterpret it as that structure,"
1612840,1615840," I would be able to actually pass it in here and it would work."
1615840,1620840," But I cannot do that easily within like a single line."
1620840,1624840," I have to do something like this, uh, right?"
1624840,1627840," Where I save this color to a separate variable,"
1627840,1632840," take it as a pointer that convert that pointer to color pointer and dereference it."
1632840,1634840," And only then I will be able to do that."
1634840,1640840," Recently, I found a very interesting trick to avoid that."
1640840,1643840," So, but let's actually first see if this thing works."
1643840,1645840," All right. So this is going to be background."
1645840,1650840," And let's introduce, uh, something like foreground, uh, foreground."
1650840,1655840," So you insert it to T, foreground, uh, there we go."
1655840,1657840," So we take a pointer."
1657840,1661840," We reinterpret that point as the color pointer and we dereference it."
1661840,1662840," And that should work."
1662840,1664840," And here we have to actually draw a circle."
1664840,1665840," Uh, right."
1665840,1669840," So in draw a circle, we accept, uh, position of the center, radius and the color."
1669840,1672840," I think let me actually confirm that 100%."
1672840,1673840," Yes."
1673840,1676840," So the radius is flawed, but I mean, it's going to be converted anyway."
1676840,1677840," So it's fine."
1677840,1680840," Let's go ahead and try to compile this entire thing."
1680840,1682840," Uh, so it doesn't accept OC."
1682840,1683840," Uh, there we go."
1683840,1686840," So, and if we try to run this entire thing, there we go."
1686840,1688840," So we have this kind of stuff."
1688840,1691840," Isn't that a poggers?"
1691840,1693840," Isn't that a poggers?"
1693840,1694840," I think it is."
1694840,1699840," So, uh, it got, uh, you know, ported very easily."
1699840,1701840," So it's the same code that we had in olive sea."
1701840,1705840," We just ported that thing to Raylib very, very easily."
1705840,1716840," So how can we just do this kind of shit, but within, like, um, with this, within a single line, within a single line."
1716840,1722840," Recently, specifically in the source code of Raylib, I found really dirty."
1722840,1726840," I found the dirtiest trick I've ever seen in my entire freaking life."
1726840,1728840," Like, holy shit."
1728840,1735840," So let's think, um, of this shit as an array."
1735840,1741840," Imagine that you have an array of you, uh, in 32 T and the array has only one element."
1741840,1745840," And that element, uh, is in fact that value."
1745840,1752840," You can actually think of that array as a literal, as the literal array."
1752840,1762840," And if you pass this entire thing to, as an argument, it gets degraded, uh, decayed to a pointer."
1762840,1771840," So that means in here, you can reinterpret that decayed pointer as a pointer to crawler and dereference that crawler."
1771840,1777840," And it fucking works."
1777840,1781840," The worst part of this trick is that it fucking works."
1781840,1783840," I hate that this shit works."
1783840,1786840," Uh, Raysan, why did you show me that?"
1786840,1792840," My brain got infected with this forbidden goddamn fucking knowledge."
1792840,1794840," Why the fuck do I know that?"
1794840,1796840," Why the fuck do I know that now?"
1796840,1801840," Like, how am I supposed to sleep now?"
1801840,1803840," Knowing that this is how you can do that."
1803840,1812840," Did you guys know about this trick?"
1812840,1814840," Did you guys know about it?"
1814840,1815840," I didn't know that."
1815840,1820840," I actually learned it literally yesterday by just exploring the Raylib source code."
1820840,1821840," So, yeah."
1821840,1822840," So, yeah."
1822840,1823840," Don't blame me for that."
1823840,1824840," Blame Raysan."
1824840,1833840," Now you're all also infected with this knowledge."
1833840,1835840," Look at this shit."
1835840,1836840," Just look at it."
1836840,1837840," Just look at it."
1837840,1838840," Just look at it."
1838840,1846840," You creating a literal array that you pass, which makes a decay into a pointer."
1846840,1851840," And then you reinterpret that pointer as a pointer to a color in UD reference."
1851840,1852840," And it fucking works."
1852840,1853840," I hate it."
1853840,1854840," I hate it."
1854840,1855840," But it works."
1855840,1856840," So, yeah."
1856840,1858840," This is how you can do that."
1858840,1859840," Yes."
1859840,1860840," Yes."
1860840,1861840," Yes."
1861840,1862840," Yes."
1862840,1863840," Yes."
1863840,1864840," Yes."
1864840,1865840," Yes."
1865840,1871840," So, we got some sub from and the author."
1871840,1873840," Thank you so much for one subscription."
1873840,1874840," Thank you."
1874840,1875840," Thank you."
1875840,1876840," Thank you."
1876840,1877840," Really appreciate that."
1877840,1878840," Really appreciate that."
1878840,1879840," So, okay."
1879840,1885840," How can we get the current sort of like a frame?"
1885840,1887840," Like the rendering frame over again."
1887840,1888840," So, I remember."
1888840,1894840," I do in fact remember that RayBeep had something with screenshots."
1894840,1896840," Ah, there we go."
1896840,1898840," You can take a screenshot of the current screen."
1898840,1899840," Right."
1899840,1902840," So, but you have to provide the file name."
1902840,1904840," So, let's do the following thing."
1904840,1906840," So, I'm going to do."
1906840,1911840," If is key pressed key P."
1911840,1912840," Right."
1912840,1916840," And we can take screenshot PNG."
1916840,1917840," Right."
1917840,1919840," So, this is what you can do."
1919840,1920840," At least."
1920840,1922840," We can take a screenshot 60 times per second."
1922840,1923840," Right."
1923840,1928840," And then we can use FF unpack to concatenate all of that into a final video."
1928840,1929840," So, it doesn't sound that bad."
1929840,1930840," Right."
1930840,1933840," So, let me, let me see."
1933840,1935840," And I'm going to start the syntaxing."
1935840,1936840," I'm going to press P."
1936840,1938840," It actually stopped for a second."
1938840,1941840," And did it create the screenshot PNG?"
1941840,1942840," Look at that."
1942840,1943840," Here is the screenshot."
1943840,1945840," We just got a screenshot."
1945840,1947840," Isn't that a poggers?"
1947840,1948840," Isn't that a boggers?"
1948840,1949840," Yes."
1949840,1950840," Yes."
1950840,1953840," But that is not particularly useful."
1953840,1954840," Right."
1954840,1958840," Like we don't want to save that to a file system as a PNG."
1958840,1962840," Because PNG just like already compresses it."
1962840,1966840," We need to let FF unpack to compress this shise."
1966840,1968840," That's what we need to do."
1968840,1973840," So, maybe there is something else in RayDeep that doesn't save it to a file."
1973840,1974840," Something related to screen."
1974840,1976840," There is a screen size."
1976840,1977840," Left screen."
1977840,1979840," Get screen width and height."
1979840,1980840," Swap screen buffers."
1980840,1981840," Is screen on the screen."
1981840,1982840," Blah blah."
1982840,1985840," Take screenshot."
1985840,1989840," Load image from screen."
1989840,1992840," Load image from screen buffer and screenshot."
1992840,1994840," And it returns you an image."
1994840,1995840," Okay."
1995840,1998840," Maybe that's what we have to do."
1998840,1999840," Right."
1999840,2001840," So, let's take a look at what exactly does this function do."
2001840,2004840," Because it sounds like something that we may want to do."
2004840,2005840," RayDeep."
2005840,2011840," So, let's go to this source code and literally find this entire thing."
2011840,2012840," I literally find."
2012840,2015840," Maybe we could have used a debugger."
2015840,2016840," A debugger bugger."
2016840,2017840," Right."
2017840,2018840," So, that would have been actually useful."
2018840,2019840," So, let me."
2019840,2020840," Let me go."
2020840,2021840," Because like I don't want to do grep."
2021840,2024840," I just want to step into this function and see what exactly it is doing."
2024840,2025840," So, main.c."
2025840,2026840," So, take."
2026840,2027840," RayDeep."
2027840,2028840," So, it creates an image."
2028840,2029840," Right."
2029840,2030840," And let's maybe exit afterwards."
2030840,2031840," So, let's rebuild this entire stuff."
2031840,2032840," And I'm going to do main."
2032840,2033840," I'm going to do main."
2033840,2037840," But I'm going to do that through software gfgf2."
2037840,2038840," Yep."
2038840,2039840," Yep."
2039840,2040840," Yep."
2040840,2043840," And I'm going to break, load the image from screen."
2043840,2044840," There we go."
2044840,2045840," So, we're going to break on that."
2045840,2047840," And I'm going to run this entire thing."
2047840,2048840," And we actually broke there."
2048840,2048840," So, let me put this thing away."
2048840,2050840," And so, what are we doing here?"
2050840,2051840," Read screen pixels."
2051840,2052840," Right."
2052840,2054840," So, essentially, it does GL read pixels, I think."
2054840,2056840," So, it's an OpenGL function that reads the current."
2056840,2057840," So, I'm going to do that through software gfgf2."
2057840,2058840," Yep."
2058840,2059840," Yep."
2059840,2060840," Yep."
2060840,2061840," Yep."
2061840,2062840," And I'm going to break, load the image from screen."
2062840,2063840," There we go."
2063840,2064840," So, we're going to break on that."
2064840,2065840," And I'm going to break on that."
2065840,2067840," And so, what are we doing here?"
2067840,2068840," Read screen pixels."
2068840,2069840," Right."
2069840,2072840," So, essentially, it does GL read pixels, I think."
2072840,2077840," So, it's an OpenGL function that, like, reads the current frame buffer."
2077840,2078840," Right."
2078840,2082840," So, it's usually used for taking screenshots and stuff like that."
2082840,2083840," Right."
2083840,2087840," And essentially, what it does, it just, like, it takes the current screen, screen coordinates."
2087840,2091840," It says the format and it just performs, you know, read pixels."
2091840,2093840," But it uses RL wrapper."
2093840,2096840," RayLib has its own wrapper over OpenGL."
2096840,2099840," So, I suppose it's a wrapper over GL read pixels."
2099840,2100840," So, let's actually confirm."
2100840,2102840," Let's actually step into that."
2102840,2103840," Okay."
2103840,2105840," So, it allocates memory."
2105840,2106840," Jesus Christ."
2106840,2108840," God damn it."
2108840,2112840," One function saves all of that stuff to a file system."
2112840,2114840," Another one keeps allocating memory."
2114840,2117840," Like, we're going to be calling this function on each frame."
2117840,2120840," But to be fair, we don't have to render it in real time."
2120840,2125840," So, maybe allocating memory, like, each frame here is not that big of a deal."
2125840,2127840," We're going to just try to use that."
2127840,2129840," And if it's going to be too slow, I'll try to do something about that."
2129840,2130840," And there we go."
2130840,2132840," It uses GL read pixels."
2132840,2134840," So, right."
2134840,2137840," So, it allocates it again?"
2137840,2140840," It allocates it again?"
2140840,2141840," Oh, do, do."
2141840,2142840," Okay."
2142840,2148840," Imagine doing at least two mallocs per frame."
2150840,2151840," Anyway."
2151840,2155840," So, I feel like we'll need to actually call, you know, GL read pixels ourselves."
2155840,2158840," We can kind of invert this entire thing ourselves as well."
2158840,2160840," Can we?"
2160840,2163840," When we are actually sending that frame over the pipe."
2163840,2164840," Right."
2164840,2167840," We can just send it row by row in a reversed order."
2167840,2169840," And that way we can flip it."
2169840,2170840," Right."
2170840,2172840," We have to allocate additional memory to flip it."
2172840,2176840," Because we can just, like, send it in a reversed order without any additional memory."
2176840,2178840," Right."
2178840,2180840," So, and as you can see here."
2180840,2182840," And then it frees it."
2182840,2184840," Like, it does two mallocs in a single free."
2185840,2186840," Okay."
2186840,2189840," So, and then we just return out of that."
2189840,2190840," Okay."
2190840,2191840," So, I think it's good."
2191840,2192840," I think it's good."
2192840,2196840," So, I'm going to try to use this entire thing."
2196840,2200840," And as far as I know."
2200840,2201840," Right."
2201840,2203840," So, if we take a look at the definition of the image."
2203840,2205840," It's just data width and height."
2205840,2209840," And this is something that we can straight up send over the pipe."
2209840,2210840," Over the right pipe."
2210840,2212840," Like, right here."
2212840,2216840," So, instead of sending pixels, we can just send data."
2216840,2218840," And the size that we're sending."
2218840,2221840," We're basically sending you in 32."
2221840,2221840," Right."
2221840,2223840," So, that's what we're sending in here."
2223840,2226840," And can we free the image?"
2226840,2228840," Or maybe it's called unload image."
2228840,2231840," Like, freeing things is called unload in Rayleap."
2231840,2232840," If I remember correctly."
2232840,2234840," Right."
2234840,2236840," So, now we're not only rendering everything."
2236840,2240840," We're also, you know, sending it as well."
2240840,2243840," I have a feeling that we probably have to do that after we ended rendering."
2243840,2247840," Because the actual swapping of the frame buffers happens in here."
2247840,2252840," So, it probably makes sense to do that like kind of outside once we've finished rendering."
2252840,2254840," And here we're actually rendering indefinitely."
2254840,2258840," So, maybe we may want to do this thing."
2258840,2259840," Right."
2259840,2260840," Right."
2260840,2263840," So, essentially we're going to be rendering this amount of frames."
2263840,2266840," And also while the window is not closed."
2266840,2267840," Right."
2267840,2269840," So, we're also going to be handling the user input."
2269840,2273840," But on top of that, it's going to be limited to like to how long we want to render all of that."
2273840,2278840," So, okay."
2278840,2279840," So, let's give it a try."
2279840,2280840," So, if I go to semicolon."
2280840,2283840," So, it feels like it's going to be super slow."
2283840,2284840," Like, seriously."
2284840,2288840," We are allocating like twice per this entire thing."
2288840,2289840," And also deallocating."
2289840,2293840," But at the same time, we're not rendering real-time things."
2293840,2294840," So, maybe that's fine."
2294840,2295840," Maybe that's totally fine."
2295840,2298840," So, by the way, taking screenshot doesn't really matter anymore."
2298840,2301840," So, okay."
2301840,2303840," I got..."
2303840,2307840," So, let's just run it and see."
2307840,2308840," Okay."
2308840,2309840," It's actually..."
2309840,2310840," Okay."
2310840,2312840," It's not that slow, honestly."
2312840,2317840," It wasn't that..."
2317840,2320840," It's finished rendering and did it really?"
2320840,2326840," What the fuck is this shit?"
2328840,2330840," Why is it so..."
2330840,2331840," Jerky?"
2331840,2333840," Do you see that as well?"
2333840,2335840," What the fuck is going on?"
2335840,2337840," Excuse me?"
2337840,2339840," Why is it like that?"
2339840,2340840," This is so bad."
2340840,2341840," Holy shit."
2341840,2344840," But, I mean, it's rendering the video, right?"
2344840,2345840," Because..."
2345840,2347840," If we switch to olive sea, right?"
2347840,2349840," So, let's actually try to do olive sea instead."
2349840,2354840," Very beef jerky."
2354840,2357840," It's actually olive sea is way faster."
2358840,2361840," Yeah, look at this buttery smooth shit."
2361840,2362840," What the fuck?"
2362840,2368840," Maybe there's..."
2368840,2370840," Like, what would even cause something like that?"
2370840,2372840," Is it something with the framebuffer?"
2372840,2378840," Because we are updating this thing using dt, which is fixed."
2378840,2383840," We're not using the getframe time."
2383840,2386840," We're not using delta time of raylib."
2386840,2388840," We're using fixed our own delta time."
2388840,2392840," So, the final animation should be all right."
2392840,2396840," So, that means the simulation is fine."
2396840,2397840," The simulation is fine."
2397840,2400840," It must be something within the current framebuffer."
2400840,2403840," The framebuffer might be containing some bush iso."
2403840,2409840," So, it might be containing some bush iso."
2409840,2419840," You're probably taking the screenshot at the wrong time."
2419840,2420840," Maybe."
2420840,2422840," Maybe that's the problem."
2422840,2426840," I can try to do that in here before."
2426840,2428840," I don't think it's gonna..."
2428840,2429840," Okay."
2429840,2430840," So, just a second."
2430840,2431840," I need to go back."
2431840,2433840," I need to go back."
2433840,2434840," Alright."
2434840,2436840," I need to go back."
2436840,2437840," Alright."
2437840,2448840," Goddammit."
2448840,2451840," That is weird."
2451840,2452840," Not gonna lie."
2452840,2462840," What if we try to illuminate this problem of, like, not knowing what the fuck is going on."
2462840,2466840," when the framebuffer is rendered or something like that."
2466840,2476840," What if we render the whole scene into the separate framebuffer."
2476840,2477840," Right."
2477840,2481840," Because the array leap has so-called render textures."
2481840,2483840," Render texture."
2483840,2484840," Right."
2484840,2488840," And essentially, you can take your rendering code."
2488840,2494840," You can basically render into the texture instead of the screen."
2494840,2495840," Right."
2495840,2499840," And then maybe we can always get the image out of the render texture."
2499840,2500840," By the way, how can you do that?"
2500840,2502840," I have Google, by the way."
2502840,2503840," So, I can..."
2503840,2505840," I should be able to do some cool shaisi."
2505840,2507840," So, essentially, let me give it a try."
2507840,2511840," So, this is going to be programming, so I'm doing Google, Google."
2511840,2516840," I'm going to provide the array leap include array leap dot h."
2516840,2517840," And here, we're going to say..."
2517840,2523840," So, I need a function that returns an image, but accepts the render texture 2D."
2523840,2524840," Right."
2524840,2525840," So, it accepts that."
2525840,2527840," Do we have any function like that?"
2527840,2528840," Because I don't remember."
2528840,2529840," Yeah."
2529840,2530840," Unload?"
2530840,2531840," That's really weird."
2531840,2532840," What?"
2532840,2533840," Okay."
2533840,2538840," Maybe it's not render texture."
2538840,2541840," Maybe it's just texture 2D."
2541840,2542840," Yeah."
2542840,2543840," Load image from texture."
2543840,2544840," So, essentially..."
2544840,2545840," Yeah."
2545840,2548840," We can render everything into render texture."
2548840,2552840," And then, we should be able to pull out the pixels out of that render texture."
2552840,2555840," So, as far as I know, if you take the render texture..."
2555840,2556840," Right."
2556840,2558840," So, it is the texture in here."
2558840,2561840," So, this is one of the things we can try to do."
2561840,2562840," Right."
2562840,2563840," One of the things we can try to do."
2563840,2566840," So, but to do that, we need to create that texture, first of all."
2566840,2567840," Right."
2567840,2569840," So, let me see how you do that."
2569840,2571840," Well, I mean, I can use Google to do that."
2571840,2578840," So, essentially, I need something that returns render texture 2D, but accepts maybe the size of the texture."
2578840,2579840," Right."
2579840,2580840," So, let's see."
2580840,2581840," Yeah."
2581840,2582840," Low texture."
2582840,2583840," There we go."
2583840,2584840," Look at that."
2584840,2587840," Google is so goddamn fucking useful."
2587840,2588840," Holy shit."
2588840,2590840," It's just like, I don't remember how it is called."
2590840,2594840," Like, I know roughly that it's supposed to return render texture."
2594840,2595840," And what render texture needs?"
2595840,2596840," It needs the size."
2596840,2598840," So, it probably accepts the size as integers."
2598840,2599840," And yeah, there we go."
2599840,2600840," There is a function like that."
2600840,2601840," Like, I don't have to remember the names."
2601840,2602840," Right."
2602840,2605840," So, I know what it does so I can find it."
2605840,2607840," So, that's actually super cool."
2607840,2608840," Fucking damn it."
2608840,2611840," So, this is why I was like, I was using Google so much."
2611840,2612840," Right."
2612840,2614840," Because it is a very useful concept."
2614840,2615840," Right."
2615840,2618840," Being able to just like, put a signature roughly."
2618840,2621840," And it roughly like, finds you something that looks like this."
2621840,2622840," Right."
2622840,2625840," And by the way, for those who doesn't know, this is the thing."
2625840,2628840," Google, I haven't uploaded the source code for this thing yet."
2628840,2629840," It's still in development."
2629840,2635840," I was about to give you the link to this magical tool that I use, but I can't give you it yet"
2635840,2636840," because it's not finished."
2636840,2637840," So, it's only for me."
2637840,2638840," It's in beta."
2638840,2639840," It's in closed beta."
2639840,2640840," It's in closed beta."
2640840,2642840," It's in closed beta."
2642840,2643840," You can't have that tool yet."
2643840,2645840," Only I can use that, unfortunately."
2645840,2647840," But soon it's going to be ready."
2647840,2649840," So, I'm going to upload it for everyone."
2649840,2651840," So, here's the screen."
2651840,2657840," And essentially, we need a function that accepts renderTexture2D."
2657840,2658840," Right."
2658840,2659840," It accepts renderTexture2D."
2659840,2660840," It doesn't return anything."
2660840,2663840," And this is basically like a beginTexture mode."
2663840,2664840," Yeah."
2664840,2665840," BeginTexture mode."
2665840,2667840," So, this is the function that we need."
2667840,2669840," So, we begin rendering."
2669840,2673840," But instead of rendering, we begin another mode."
2673840,2674840," Right."
2674840,2675840," So, this is a screen."
2675840,2678840," We render into this texture and then we end texture mode."
2678840,2679840," There we go."
2679840,2686840," So, interestingly, on top of just rendering everything into..."
2687840,2690840," To the texture, we can also render it on the screen."
2690840,2691840," Who said we can't do that?"
2691840,2692840," Right."
2692840,2694840," So, just to be able to see that thing."
2694840,2695840," Just to be able to see that thing."
2695840,2697840," I think it would make sense."
2697840,2700840," So, I suppose that thing should acceptTexture2D."
2700840,2701840," It should accept the position."
2701840,2704840," Maybe a couple of integers."
2704840,2706840," And yeah, that's basically it."
2706840,2709840," So, setTextureFilter."
2709840,2711840," LoadRenderTexture."
2711840,2713840," No, it is not called like that."
2713840,2716840," So, maybe it also accepts the color."
2716840,2717840," We can say that..."
2717840,2718840," Yeah, there we go."
2718840,2719840," DrawTexture."
2719840,2720840," There we go."
2720840,2721840," So, we found that."
2721840,2722840," So, that's what we want to put in here."
2722840,2723840," DrawTexture."
2723840,2725840," And we're going to take this screen."
2725840,2728840," And the position is going to be 0, 0."
2728840,2729840," And tint is going to be white."
2729840,2732840," So, we are rendering scene into the texture."
2732840,2734840," We're also displaying it on the screen."
2734840,2735840," So, we can see that."
2735840,2736840," Right."
2736840,2739840," But we're going to be saving this stuff from that texture instead."
2739840,2740840," So, texture image."
2740840,2743840," So, what was that called?"
2743840,2745840," Load image from texture."
2745840,2746840," Okay."
2746840,2749840," So, this is going to be screen texture."
2749840,2750840," So, we've got the image."
2750840,2751840," We're going to be sending it there."
2751840,2752840," And then we're going to unload the image."
2752840,2755840," Because I suppose it allocates the memory for that."
2755840,2757840," So, this is how we can do all of that."
2760840,2761840," Alright."
2761840,2765840," So, let's try to recompile this entire thing."
2765840,2767840," So, let's go to..."
2767840,2769840," Where is the build?"
2769840,2772840," Let me see if it compiles still."
2772840,2773840," Okay."
2773840,2774840," So, that's cool."
2774840,2777840," And let's run this entire thing."
2777840,2779840," What the fuck?"
2779840,2780840," Pixel data retrieved?"
2780840,2783840," Why the fuck do you log that?"
2783840,2784840," Really?"
2784840,2788840," Why the freak do you log that?"
2788840,2790840," I do not understand it."
2790840,2792840," This is so bizarre to me."
2792840,2798840," Why don't you log it when I take the current screen thingy."
2798840,2800840," But you log it when you retrieve that data."
2800840,2801840," This is like..."
2801840,2805840," I swear to God."
2805840,2807840," Just a second."
2807840,2810840," I want to see where it is logged."
2810840,2811840," Like, what the fuck."
2815840,2817840," Can I grab pixel data retrieved successfully?"
2817840,2818840," Show me that."
2818840,2821840," Why?"
2821840,2826840," Okay."
2826840,2827840," So, it is logged."
2827840,2829840," Can you make it debug at least?"
2829840,2830840," Like, please."
2830840,2835840," I think this must be a debug."
2835840,2836840," Right."
2836840,2838840," Debug by default is not really displayed."
2838840,2839840," So, yeah."
2839840,2842840," Let's keep it debug."
2842840,2846840," I'm going to try to rebuild it."
2846840,2848840," I wonder if it will just pick up my change."
2848840,2850840," Yeah, it picked up my change."
2850840,2851840," Okay."
2851840,2853840," So, we can rebuild RayDip."
2853840,2858840," Okay."
2858840,2859840," So, it needs to relink all of that stuff."
2859840,2861840," But, I mean, it's not going to be too long."
2861840,2864840," Because it doesn't need to recompile everything."
2864840,2866840," And let's just install it again."
2866840,2869840," All right."
2869840,2870840," So, yeah."
2870840,2874840," I can, in real time, modify RayDip to use in my current project."
2874840,2879840," Unfortunately, it's not particularly useful, in my opinion."
2879840,2880840," Right."
2880840,2882840," Because I can't really ship it on Linux."
2882840,2883840," Right."
2883840,2888840," Because people essentially build with their own version of RayDip."
2888840,2889840," So, it's not particularly useful."
2889840,2890840," So, yeah."
2890840,2891840," Whatever."
2891840,2894840," Anyways."
2894840,2896840," So, where is the main scene?"
2896840,2898840," This is main scene."
2898840,2901840," And if I rebuild the entire stuff."
2901840,2902840," Yeah, there we go."
2902840,2904840," As you can see, it doesn't log that anymore."
2904840,2906840," It's actually..."
2906840,2907840," It looks all right."
2907840,2908840," It looks all right."
2908840,2910840," And if we take a look at the VLC."
2911840,2913840," It is smooth."
2913840,2914840," It is smooth."
2914840,2915840," It is smooth."
2915840,2917840," Not bad."
2917840,2918840," Not bad at all."
2918840,2921840," Okay."
2921840,2925840," Just make a vendor folder."
2925840,2926840," It's not a bad idea, actually."
2926840,2927840," Maybe."
2927840,2931840," Because RayLib itself is really small."
2931840,2936840," We might as well make the compilation of RayLib part of the compilation of the project."
2936840,2938840," Right."
2941840,2945840," I put RayLib inside the project in its internal dependency."
2945840,2946840," Yeah."
2946840,2950840," So, I feel like this kind of approach becomes increasingly more popular."
2950840,2956840," As the sort of like a dependency delivery infrastructure becomes more and more hostile."
2956840,2958840," Right."
2958840,2961840," So, I think it does."
2962840,2963840," So, let me..."
2963840,2964840," So, let me..."
2964840,2970840," We can compare this thing to OliveC."
2970840,2971840," Right."
2971840,2973840," So, let me..."
2973840,2974840," Let me do..."
2974840,2976840," So, let's do the OliveC."
2988840,2991840," Don't you notice something weird?"
2991840,2993840," Don't you notice something weird?"
2993840,2997840," Don't you notice something weird?"
2997840,3006840," They feel different."
3006840,3007840," Oh..."
3007840,3008840," So, RayLib."
3008840,3009840," Okay."
3009840,3010840," Let's take a look."
3010840,3011840," This is OliveC."
3011840,3012840," This is RayLib."
3012840,3013840," It's freaking flipped."
3013840,3021840," So, RayLib flips for the screenshot, but it doesn't flip when you try to take the pixels out of..."
3021840,3022840," Oh, cut."
3022840,3022840," Mmmmm."
3022840,3023840," It's freaking flipped."
3023840,3024840," It's freaking flipped."
3024840,3034840," So, RayLib flips for the screenshot, but it doesn't flip when you try to take the pixels out of the..."
3034840,3035840," Oh, cut."
3035840,3036840," Mmmmm."
3036840,3044840," Get fucking dead."
3044840,3055840," So, we'll get some subs."
3055840,3061840," Thank you so much, GhostyX101 for tier 1 subscription with the message."
3061840,3062840," Hi!"
3062840,3063840," Hi."
3063840,3066840," And AnonymousGifter, thank you so much for gifting one sub."
3066840,3067840," Thank you."
3067840,3068840," Thank you."
3068840,3071840," So, let's try to flip that."
3071840,3079840," And, as already said, by the way, we can actually flip this Scheisse without allocating any memory or anything like that."
3079840,3083840," So, essentially, here, we're just passing the whole image."
3083840,3085840," Like, we're just writing the whole image as it is."
3085840,3088840," We can write the image row by row."
3088840,3089840," Right."
3089840,3091840," So, let's actually go ahead and iterate the rows."
3091840,3096840," So, we're going to iterate from 0 and y less than height."
3096840,3098840," So, something like this."
3098840,3099840," Right."
3099840,3106840," And, essentially, in here, we are going to be writing the whole row of the width."
3106840,3111840," And, here, we're going to do plus y multiplied by width."
3111840,3115840," So, but we have to be careful with the pointer arithmetic in here."
3115840,3116840," What is data?"
3116840,3118840," Let me take a look."
3118840,3120840," RayLib.h."
3120840,3121840," So, this is going to be..."
3121840,3122840," It's void star."
3122840,3125840," So, we need to cast it to appropriate pointer."
3125840,3127840," So, let's cast it to pointer this."
3127840,3129840," So, it just, like, naturally upsets properly."
3129840,3132840," So, here, we're writing it row by row."
3132840,3136840," And, now, we can quite easily just swap it."
3136840,3137840," Right."
3137840,3139840," Iterate up until greater than zero."
3139840,3140840," Right."
3140840,3141840," So, and just minus minus."
3141840,3144840," And, in here, we probably will have to do y minus one."
3144840,3145840," But, right."
3145840,3146840," So, y is unsigned."
3146840,3148840," So, we have to be careful with going below zero."
3148840,3149840," Right."
3149840,3151840," So, it's actually very important."
3151840,3152840," Right."
3152840,3156840," And, essentially, here, we're writing the rows in the reversed order."
3156840,3158840," So, that's what we're doing."
3158840,3159840," Okay."
3159840,3162840," So, let's try to do that."
3162840,3174840," And, now, if we compare this thing, let's call it maybe array lib flipped."
3174840,3175840," So, this is..."
3175840,3176840," Okay."
3176840,3177840," It goes down."
3177840,3179840," And, this one goes down as well."
3179840,3180840," Okay."
3180840,3182840," So, they're like, you know, equivalent."
3182840,3184840," So, this is basically what we have to do."
3184840,3185840," Right."
3185840,3188840," That's the easiest way to go about it."
3188840,3193840," All right."
3193840,3196840," So, that's pretty cool."
3196840,3203840," But, how the fuck do we synchronize this shit with the music?"
3203840,3205840," That's a very interesting question, right?"
3205840,3209840," Because, we need to do that somehow."
3209840,3214840," We can, I suppose, overlay music on top of this stuff."
3214840,3215840," Right."
3215840,3220840," So, let's grab some songs."
3220840,3221840," Let's grab some songs."
3221840,3222840," I'm gonna copy."
3222840,3226840," Programming, inserting, mutualizer."
3226840,3232840," So, music, null, VIPs, just another."
3232840,3234840," And, this is gonna be one."
3234840,3238840," So, I'm gonna grab this specific song and I'm gonna copy paste it in here."
3238840,3239840," Okay."
3239840,3243840," So, we can essentially treat that as the second input."
3243840,3246840," So, in FFMPAC, you can actually have several inputs."
3246840,3247840," Right."
3247840,3249840," You can have several inputs."
3249840,3252840," Essentially, this is the first input."
3252840,3255840," We accept it through the standard input."
3255840,3257840," We say that it's a raw video."
3257840,3259840," The pixel format is that."
3259840,3261840," The resolution, frame rate, and stuff like that."
3261840,3262840," It doesn't have audio."
3262840,3264840," We don't really have to specify that it doesn't have audio."
3264840,3266840," We can just, like, never provide it."
3266840,3267840," Right."
3267840,3276840," And then we can say, okay, the second input, the second input is going to be this."
3276840,3277840," Right."
3277840,3282840," And that essentially means that it's going to merge them together."
3282840,3283840," So, it will detect that."
3283840,3283840," Okay."
3283840,3285840," So, you provided two inputs."
3285840,3286840," And one input has video."
3286840,3288840," The second input has audio."
3288840,3290840," So, that means you basically want to merge them."
3290840,3293840," And FFMPAC will make an executive decision of just creating the final video."
3293840,3294840," So, this is how it works."
3294840,3295840," Right."
3295840,3298840," It tries to sometimes kind of guess what the fuck you want from it."
3298840,3302840," So, it doesn't really work every time."
3302840,3310840," And because of that, there is a syntax that allows you to pick certain channels within certain inputs to merge them properly."
3310840,3311840," Right."
3311840,3313840," So, maybe you want an input from one video."
3313840,3314840," Right."
3314840,3320840," So, the video from the first input, but the audio from the second output."
3320840,3323840," You can specify what exactly you're taking from where."
3323840,3324840," Right."
3324840,3326840," But in here, I think we can just provide it like that."
3326840,3328840," And it will just like merge them."
3328840,3332840," So, let's go ahead and just literally run it."
3332840,3333840," Right."
3333840,3339840," And see if it's going to do the thing."
3339840,3342840," Okay."
3342840,3344840," So, it just included the video."
3344840,3345840," Right."
3345840,3347840," It included the audio."
3347840,3349840," But what's going to happen after 10 seconds?"
3349840,3350840," So, okay."
3350840,3352840," That's very interesting."
3352840,3355840," Basically, it took the longest one."
3355840,3356840," Right."
3356840,3357840," And there is no more video anymore."
3357840,3359840," So, it just like stopped."
3359840,3362840," That's very interesting."
3362840,3365840," So, essentially what we have to do."
3365840,3371840," The video generator needs to generate the video while analyzing the audio."
3371840,3372840," Right."
3372840,3373840," While analyzing the audio."
3373840,3380840," So, it needs to actually generate as much of the frame as the length of the audio."
3380840,3387840," And as it generates the frame, it should iterate through the waveform and do the FFT analysis and stuff like that."
3387840,3393840," And then we give all of that to FFmPack and hopefully it will just like synchronize and merge everything together."
3393840,3395840," So, that's basically the idea."
3397840,3399840," You'll need frames from the audio."
3399840,3401840," Says C64 Cosmin."
3401840,3402840," Yeah."
3402840,3406840," So, and because of that, we'll have to load that specific audio."
3406840,3408840," So, we're going to be giving that audio to FFmPack."
3408840,3411840," And we're also going to load that audio ourselves."
3412840,3414840," We're going to also load it ourselves."
3414840,3417840," And we're going to be analyzing it as we generate the frames."
3417840,3419840," So, and that's why I suppose we're going to, how we're going to do that."
3419840,3420840," Right."
3420840,3425840," So, and depending on the FPS, we're going to be handling the samples from the audio with a different speed."
3425840,3426840," Right."
3426840,3430840," So, to make sure that we synchronize the audio with the video."
3430840,3432840," So, and this is a very interesting thing."
3432840,3433840," Right."
3433840,3441840," Because in the actual visualization, in a mutualizer visualization, we don't have a control over how we synchronize audio and the video."
3441840,3442840," Right."
3442840,3450840," Because the audio system is just running in a separate thread and periodically calls our callback, giving us the new frames."
3450840,3458840," But as far as I know, the audio system of RayLib and the video system of RayLib, they do not communicate with each other and they don't try to synchronize with each other."
3458840,3462840," So, it's just like, it works as it works."
3462840,3463840," Right."
3463840,3465840," It just works as it works."
3465840,3472840," But when we're doing the offline rendering, when we're doing the like final offline rendering, we'll have control over that."
3472840,3476840," And we'll have to take this conscious decision of how many samples we're handling per frame."
3476840,3477840," Okay."
3477840,3480840," But I mean, we usually know the amount of samples per second."
3480840,3481840," Right."
3481840,3484840," And it's usually 48,000 samples per second."
3484840,3490840," So, we can just take 48,000 and divide it by FPS, which is 60, 48 by 60."
3490840,3492840," And this is how many samples per frame we will have to handle."
3492840,3493840," Right."
3493840,3494840," We can even see if it's divisible."
3494840,3495840," Right."
3495840,3498840," If I divide it like that, it actually divides perfectly."
3498840,3499840," Right."
3499840,3501840," So, we have 48,000 samples in the audio."
3501840,3502840," We divide it by 60 FPS."
3502840,3506840," And this is basically how many samples we handle per frame."
3506840,3510840," And we just put that into FFT, you know, analyzer."
3510840,3511840," And it's just like, okay."
3511840,3516840," So, everything just like, you know, works out more or less properly."
3516840,3524840," What happens if the application is slow and cannot do 60 FPS?"
3524840,3525840," It doesn't matter."
3525840,3527840," Because we are rendering video in offline."
3527840,3528840," Right."
3528840,3535840," So, essentially, we just have to say to FFMPAC, we are rendering video that is 60 FPS."
3535840,3541840," And what we have to do, we have to supply enough frames for the duration to be at 60 FPS."
3541840,3544840," And FFMPAC will just synchronize all of them to 60 FPS."
3544840,3549840," So, just because we're rendering 60 FPS video doesn't mean that we have to render the frames at 60 FPS."
3549840,3554840," We just have to render enough frames for 60 FPS video."
3554840,3555840," Right."
3555840,3556840," You see what I'm talking about?"
3556840,3557840," Right."
3557840,3559840," We are not displaying at 60 FPS."
3559840,3560840," Right."
3560840,3561840," We're not displaying in real time at 60 FPS."
3561840,3563840," We're displaying them in offline."
3563840,3567840," So, that means we can take as much time as we want to render a single frame."
3567840,3569840," We can render a single frame per minute."
3569840,3572840," But at the end of the day, we're going to have 60 FPS video."
3572840,3573840," Right."
3573840,3582840," So, that's why the actual speed doesn't really matter that much for the end result."
3582840,3584840," It would be better if it was faster, of course."
3584840,3586840," But, I mean, it doesn't matter."
3586840,3591840," All right."
3591840,3592840," Okay, guys."
3592840,3594840," So, that seems to be good."
3594840,3596840," That seems to be good."
3596840,3600840," So, I think I want to make a small break."
3600840,3602840," I want to make a small break."
3602840,3611840," And after the break, we're going to try to integrate this entire thing into the visualizer."
3611840,3612840," Right."
3612840,3615840," Let me show you the visualizer one more time."
3615840,3616840," So, that's the visualizer."
3616840,3623840," And the point of the visualizer is that you can basically take any song and it will start visualizing it like that."
3623840,3627840," I hope the encoding doesn't really ruin the view too much."
3627840,3628840," Right."
3628840,3636840," But essentially, our goal is to be able to then press some button and it should call the button back and start rendering it at very high resolution."
3636840,3641840," So, yeah, that's basically what we're doing in here."
3641840,3644840," So, that's pretty cool."
3644840,3645840," All right."
3645840,3646840," Let's make some break."
3646840,3647840," Okay."
3647840,3649840," So, one thing I want to do in here."
3649840,3650840," Right."
3650840,3658840," The one thing I want to do in here is I want to take this entire stuff that starts up the FFMPAC process and put it in a separate function."
3658840,3659840," Right."
3659840,3667840," So, maybe we can do something like FFMPAC start rendering."
3667840,3668840," Right."
3668840,3671840," And it's supposed to return the pipe."
3671840,3672840," Right."
3672840,3679840," It's supposed to return the pipe into which you're going to be, you know, sending the frames and stuff like that."
3679840,3681840," So, let me put this stuff in here."
3681840,3683840," Right."
3683840,3686840," And, yeah, I think that's fine."
3686840,3690840," So, we probably may want to accept two things in here."
3690840,3691840," Yeah."
3691840,3697840," We'll definitely have to accept the resolution and stuff like that because it might be variable."
3697840,3701840," So, here, right now, the resolution is just, like, fine."
3701840,3705840," You know what?"
3705840,3715840," I think I'm going to start, like, literally copy-pasting this thing into the final mutualizer somewhere in the plugin."
3716840,3720840," So, somewhere here I think it would be fine."
3720840,3725840," So, we close the read end, but we're supposed to return the write end."
3725840,3726840," Right."
3726840,3727840," So, this is the write end."
3727840,3729840," And you know what?"
3729840,3734840," I think, naturally, we may have FFMPAC end rendering."
3734840,3735840," Right."
3735840,3740840," FFMPAC end rendering, which will accept the pipe that this thing returns."
3740840,3741840," Right."
3741840,3743840," So, this is the pipe."
3743840,3745840," And it will close that pipe."
3745840,3746840," Close that pipe."
3746840,3749840," And wait until the process finishes."
3749840,3750840," Right."
3750840,3751840," So, it needs to do wait null."
3751840,3752840," Right."
3752840,3757840," And after we close the pipe, we wait until the status of the child process changes."
3757840,3762840," And that way, we sort of synchronized with the child process."
3762840,3763840," So, that's actually kind of cool."
3763840,3764840," Right."
3764840,3767840," So, you start the rendering and then you finish the rendering."
3767840,3774840," So, in here, we may accept things like the width and height with which we're rendering."
3774840,3775840," Then FPS."
3775840,3781840," And then maybe things like sound file path."
3781840,3782840," Right."
3782840,3786840," So, sound file path that we're going to actually put in here."
3786840,3788840," Sound file path."
3788840,3793840," So, that's basically what we can do in here."
3793840,3798840," So, interestingly, we do a return in here if something wrong happens."
3798840,3803840," And we return one as an indication, as an error."
3803840,3805840," But if we're going to be returning the pipe."
3805840,3806840," Right."
3806840,3807840," If we're going to be returning the right pipe."
3807840,3809840," One is a valid pipe."
3809840,3814840," So, what we have to do, we have to go through all these returns and return like a negative thing."
3814840,3815840," Right."
3815840,3818840," So, now the error is indicated by a negative value."
3818840,3820840," And I think it makes sense."
3820840,3826840," And if you return something that is not negative, that's the final pipe that you can work with."
3826840,3827840," Right."
3827840,3830840," So, that's basically what we can have."
3830840,3833840," That is basically what we can have."
3833840,3835840," That's pretty cool."
3835840,3842840," So, and let me maybe try to compile Mutualizer just to see if this entire thing will compile in here."
3842840,3843840," Because we'll have to copy paste a lot."
3843840,3844840," Yeah."
3844840,3845840," Okay."
3845840,3847840," So, we'll have to include a lot of things."
3847840,3848840," Right."
3848840,3851840," Because pipe is available in a very specific place."
3851840,3854840," And here's another unpleasant thing in here, chat."
3854840,3855840," Here's another unpleasant thing."
3855840,3858840," It uses a lot of Linux-specific things."
3858840,3861840," But here, we're using only cross-platform things."
3861840,3862840," Right."
3862840,3865840," So far, we've been using only cross-platform stuff."
3865840,3868840," Libc, all that stuff is available on Windows."
3868840,3870840," Arraylib is available on Windows."
3870840,3874840," But now, we're using Linux-specific inter-process communication."
3874840,3877840," And that is not available on Windows."
3877840,3885840," So, it feels right to maybe separate this entire thing into like a module and whatnot."
3885840,3886840," Right."
3886840,3888840," What if we have like a separate translation."
3888840,3890840," So, we're going to have ffmpeg header."
3890840,3891840," Right."
3891840,3892840," So, let's have inclusion guard."
3892840,3893840," Right."
3893840,3896840," If not defined ffmpeg h."
3896840,3897840," Let's define that."
3897840,3898840," And let's close the include guard."
3898840,3900840," So, we can't include header twice."
3900840,3905840," And we're going to have two signatures in here."
3905840,3908840," So, start rendering and end rendering."
3908840,3914840," And maybe, we're going to have a c file which is called ffmpeg linux c."
3914840,3919840," And this is where we're going to have Linux implementation of this interface."
3919840,3927840," What if we say, okay, so here is the cross-platform interface of starting ffmpeg process."
3927840,3930840," And I'm going to implement it only for Linux."
3930840,3947840," And then, when it's time to port this entire thing for Windows and macOS, we're going to have separate ffmpeg_windows, ffmpeg_macos that use the native mechanisms of operating system to start the child process and communicate with that child process."
3947840,3948840," Right."
3948840,3949840," So, yeah."
3949840,3953840," Right now, like, it's not going to compile on Windows, obviously."
3953840,3959840," But we leave a little bit of a room to add Windows support for this kind of stuff later."
3959840,3961840," And maybe we can do that on the stream as well."
3961840,3962840," Right."
3962840,3966840," So, I recently discovered such thing as, you know, Wine GCC."
3966840,3970840," And also, I recently learned that MinJW is also available on Linux."
3970840,3978840," So, we can theoretically do Windows development on Linux by doing cross-compilation and just, like, test this kind of stuff in Wine."
3978840,3981840," So, that would have been interesting."
3981840,3984840," That would have been interesting."
3984840,3990840," Yeah."
3990840,3991840," That's pretty cool."
3991840,3997840," So much work for a niche video game system."
3997840,3998840," I know, right?"
3998840,4000840," Too many gamers."
4000840,4001840," Too many gamers."
4001840,4002840," Too many gamers."
4002840,4003840," All right."
4003840,4007840," So, let me copy-paste the implementation in here."
4007840,4010840," And we're going to put it like that."
4010840,4015840," So, here, we're going to just include ffmpeg."
4015840,4016840," Right."
4016840,4017840," So, here is ffmpeg."
4017840,4018840," So, okay."
4018840,4027840," And when we're building this entire stuff, we're going to be linking with ffmpeg Linux."
4027840,4030840," So, here we're just building mutualizer."
4030840,4034840," But here, we're building the plugin for mutualizer for hot reloading."
4034840,4036840," So, we're going to have src ffmpeg Linux."
4036840,4040840," And when we disable hot reloading, we're going to link everything together."
4040840,4042840," Like so."
4042840,4047840," So, let's try to compile and see how miserly it's going to fail."
4047840,4048840," Right."
4048840,4052840," So, it doesn't have size t, but this is because it needs the standard input."
4052840,4053840," You know what?"
4053840,4057840," I'm going to go and just like copy-paste like literally all of these headers in here."
4057840,4062840," Because I know that they're going to be sufficient enough for compilation, hopefully."
4062840,4063840," So, read_ent."
4063840,4065840," We don't have read_ent defined."
4065840,4073840," It's a custom macros that just define the index for the array of pipe file descriptors."
4073840,4074840," Right."
4074840,4076840," Because when you create a pipe, it gives you two file descriptors."
4076840,4078840," And so, I don't confuse myself."
4078840,4082840," I assigned like a read_ent to 0 and write_ent to 1."
4082840,4083840," Right."
4083840,4085840," So, at least they have like a human readable mnemonics."
4085840,4087840," All right."
4087840,4088840," So, let's go."
4088840,4089840," And okay."
4089840,4093840," So, here we supply width and height."
4093840,4097840," But we do it like that because it was known at compile time."
4097840,4101840," We can't really know that stuff at compile time anymore."
4101840,4110840," So, what if we allocate some buffer for the resolution."
4110840,4117840," And just basically ascent printf this stuff in here width and height."
4117840,4121840," And just pass it like that."
4121840,4123840," I think that's a good thing to do."
4123840,4126840," The same can go for FPS as well."
4126840,4129840," But the question is how big of a buffer this should be?"
4129840,4130840," How big of a buffer this should be?"
4130840,4131840," Okay."
4131840,4135840," So, size t is unsigned a 64-bit integer."
4135840,4138840," So, that means its maximum value is 64."
4138840,4143840," If you take the amount of characters, it's 20 characters."
4143840,4144840," Right."
4144840,4147840," So, here we have width, x, height."
4147840,4150840," So, that means we'll need this kind of stuff twice."
4150840,4153840," And plus additional character for the x."
4153840,4156840," So, we need at least 41 character."
4156840,4161840," plus maybe zero for an ultiminator."
4161840,4162840," So, 42."
4162840,4166840," Essentially, it makes sense to just allocate 64 bytes in here on the stack."
4166840,4169840," And it's going to be like always enough."
4169840,4171840," It's always going to be enough in here."
4171840,4172840," So, I think that's good."
4172840,4173840," Right."
4173840,4175840," And for the frame rate, FPS is also the same thing."
4175840,4180840," We can just do frame rate and just render it like that."
4180840,4182840," So, this is going to be FPS."
4182840,4183840," And, yeah."
4183840,4185840," So, that's fine."
4185840,4189840," And, you know, 128 bytes on the stack is not that much to be fair."
4189840,4196840," So, I think we can afford to have that on the stack."
4196840,4200840," We can also increase the quality."
4200840,4201840," Right."
4201840,4203840," So, here I'm specifying the codec for video."
4203840,4207840," So, the codec for audio, usually the one that works on Twitter."
4207840,4208840," Right."
4208840,4212840," By the way, uploading videos on Twitter is such a huge pain in the ass."
4212840,4217840," Because Twitter only works with videos with a specific video and audio codec."
4217840,4224840," It has to be specifically H264 and the audio codec has to be specifically AAC."
4224840,4228840," If it's something else, it's going to tell you, I can't process."
4228840,4229840," What the fuck is this?"
4229840,4232840," I do not understand what the fuck you just uploaded."
4232840,4234840," It's just like so frustrating."
4234840,4240840," So, maybe it makes sense to, by default, have AAC so it's uploadable on Twitter."
4240840,4241840," Right."
4241840,4248840," Because that's primarily where you want to show off to those plebs who can't program."
4248840,4249840," Right."
4249840,4254840," And that's why they're spending all day on Twitter."
4254840,4255840," So, anyway."
4255840,4256840," Right."
4256840,4258840," And we can specify the bitrate."
4258840,4262840," So, the video bitrate is VB, if I'm not mistaken."
4262840,4263840," So, what's going to be..."
4263840,4265840," Let's say it's going to be 3..."
4265840,4267840," Let's not put too much framerate."
4267840,4271840," Because I'm not sure if it's going to be too resource-consuming for my PC while I'm streaming."
4271840,4275840," So, let's not put too much load on that."
4275840,4276840," Okay, good."
4276840,4280840," So, let's try to compile it one more time."
4280840,4282840," So, here we have height."
4282840,4283840," Oh, it's SN printf."
4283840,4290840," So, I have to provide the buffer and the size of the buffer before I can actually render all of that stuff."
4290840,4296840," So, this is the frame rate and size of the frame rate."
4296840,4297840," Let me go."
4297840,4298840," Okay."
4298840,4299840," So, it compiles."
4299840,4302840," This entire piece of code, in fact, compiles."
4302840,4304840," That is very cool."
4304840,4305840," Okay."
4305840,4309840," How are we going to be doing all of that?"
4309840,4310840," Right."
4310840,4315840," From the, from the Musualizer user perspective."
4315840,4325840," I suppose you upload a file and you just press a button and it starts rendering."
4325840,4327840," So, what's going to be the rendering?"
4327840,4330840," I suppose rendering is going to be a separate mode."
4330840,4333840," So, plug update is a very big function."
4333840,4336840," But what it does, it renders a single frame."
4336840,4337840," Right."
4337840,4339840," It renders a single frame."
4339840,4343840," So, one thing it checks, it checks whether music currently playing."
4343840,4344840," Right."
4344840,4347840," If the music currently playing, it does the visualization."
4347840,4352840," If the music not playing, it displays drag and drop music here."
4352840,4353840," Right."
4353840,4354840," So, we can essentially even demonstrate."
4354840,4355840," Right."
4355840,4359840," So, the music currently is not playing, but there is no error going on."
4359840,4360840," So, error has not happened."
4360840,4363840," So, it just like prints drag and drop music here."
4363840,4369840," If you drag and drop something that it cannot read, it will tell you could not load the file."
4369840,4371840," But if you drag and drop something that it can, it starts visualizing."
4371840,4374840," So, this is basically three different states in here."
4374840,4375840," Right."
4375840,4382840," And essentially, all of these three states are encoded in this function."
4382840,4391840," So, we need some sort of like another state that essentially says, we are currently rendering."
4391840,4392840," Right."
4392840,4395840," We need some sort of special state that says, we are currently rendering."
4395840,4400840," We can indicate that state with a boolean rendering."
4400840,4401840," Right."
4401840,4402840," Right."
4402840,4403840," If it's true, we are currently rendering."
4403840,4405840," If it's false, we are not currently rendering."
4405840,4407840," I think that makes sense."
4407840,4408840," Okay."
4408840,4416840," So, here, this entire stuff that checks that music is currently playing, we do visualization,"
4416840,4422840," which is 143 lines of code, and also the else branch that prints the drag and drop music"
4422840,4427840," and couldn't load file, all of that is behind a huge condition."
4427840,4429840," We are not rendering."
4429840,4434840," So, if we're not rendering, this is basically what we're doing here."
4434840,4435840," Right."
4435840,4437840," But if we are rendering."
4437840,4438840," Right."
4438840,4444840," This is where we're going to be basically advancing the simulation of this FFT thingy."
4444840,4445840," Right."
4445840,4450840," As we do in the actual rendering and stuff like that, and sending the frames into FFMPAC process."
4450840,4456840," So, if we reach this condition, FFMPAC process should be already running somehow."
4456840,4459840," It should be already running somehow."
4459840,4461840," So, okay."
4461840,4464840," But how is it going to be running?"
4464840,4467840," So, here, we're not rendering."
4467840,4470840," And within the rendering, we're handling different keys."
4470840,4472840," Like, when you press space, it pauses the music."
4472840,4473840," Right."
4473840,4474840," And then pauses it."
4474840,4475840," So, you can see."
4475840,4479840," And also, when you press Q, it restarts the music from the beginning."
4479840,4484840," We can maybe add another key in here that starts the rendering."
4484840,4485840," Right."
4485840,4486840," Another key that starts the rendering."
4486840,4487840," Key is pressed."
4487840,4489840," Which key is it going to be?"
4489840,4490840," Maybe R?"
4490840,4491840," Right."
4491840,4492840," So, for rendering."
4492840,4497840," And what we're going to do in here, for now at least, for now, we're going to say,"
4497840,4498840," rendering true."
4498840,4502840," So, now, this entire condition will be redirected to here."
4502840,4507840," So, effectively, now, if I press R, we're going to softlock ourselves."
4507840,4512840," Oh, R is already taken because it reloads the thing."
4512840,4514840," Let's use maybe F."
4514840,4515840," Right."
4515840,4518840," Because I'm pretty sure we're going to die a lot while trying to do that."
4518840,4521840," So, why not call this feature F?"
4521840,4522840," Right."
4522840,4523840," So, let's call it F."
4523840,4524840," Right."
4524840,4527840," So, let me restart the entire thing."
4527840,4530840," So, it's playing."
4530840,4531840," And I'm going to press F."
4531840,4534840," And it stopped playing effectively."
4534840,4536840," It stopped playing and doesn't display anything."
4536840,4538840," Okay."
4538840,4543840," So, we have an ability from the actual plane switch to rendering state."
4543840,4545840," But we don't do anything there."
4545840,4548840," So, it would be kind of nice to know that we are in a rendering state."
4548840,4550840," Maybe it makes sense to just print something."
4550840,4552840," I'm going to really copy paste this entire code."
4552840,4554840," The same code that displays drag and drop and stuff like that."
4554840,4556840," I'm literally copy pasting this entire code."
4556840,4562840," But what I'm going to do, I'm going to just set the color to, I think, white."
4562840,4563840," Right."
4563840,4571840," And the label is going to be rendering video."
4571840,4572840," Something like that."
4572840,4573840," I think that's good."
4573840,4575840," And that's it."
4575840,4576840," Right."
4576840,4578840," So, let's try to recompile this entire thing."
4578840,4580840," And I'm going to quickly."
4580840,4584840," So, let's put something from here."
4584840,4587840," Rendering video."
4587840,4589840," Isn't that cool?"
4589840,4591840," I think that's pretty cool."
4591840,4594840," But you can't really go outside of that state."
4594840,4598840," As soon as you went into the rendering video state, you kind of softlocked yourself."
4598840,4598840," Right."
4598840,4600840," Because there is no way to get out of it."
4600840,4604840," As of right now, we can try to put something like a temporary measure."
4604840,4605840," Right."
4605840,4609840," If is key pressed and that key is F."
4609840,4614840," If you press F again, we're going to reset plug rendering to false."
4614840,4615840," Right."
4615840,4616840," So, we'll try to recompile."
4616840,4617840," Reload."
4617840,4618840," And I press again."
4618840,4619840," It continues playing."
4619840,4622840," And now we can flip-flop between these two states."
4622840,4623840," Right."
4623840,4624840," So, you see how it works?"
4624840,4626840," So, basically, it's like a huge state machine."
4626840,4627840," Right."
4627840,4632840," So, we have like a single boolean that switches whether we are in a rendering state or not rendering state."
4632840,4635840," So, it's sort of like a big contraption."
4635840,4636840," Right."
4636840,4643840," So, programming is basically building like a contraption out of the instructions."
4643840,4644840," Right."
4644840,4646840," So, and..."
4646840,4647840," Okay."
4647840,4652840," Let's go back to this state where we start rendering."
4652840,4653840," Right."
4653840,4654840," Where we start rendering."
4654840,4662840," When we start rendering, what we want to do, I suppose, we need to reset the state of FFT analyzer."
4662840,4663840," Right."
4663840,4668840," We need to reset the state of FFT analyzer because we're going to start the simulation from scratch."
4668840,4671840," We need to start the simulation from scratch so we can render it for the video."
4671840,4676840," The whole state of the FFT analyzer is these six buffers."
4676840,4679840," So, essentially, what we need to do, we need to reset them to zero."
4679840,4690840," So, the first two buffers contains the input that we receive from the audio system, then output after FFT analysis and then smoothing, some scaling and stuff like that."
4690840,4691840," Right."
4691840,4698840," For example, the state of the smooth depends on the previous state of the log and the smear depends on the smooth."
4698840,4701840," So, we'll be kind of like do a simulation and stuff like that."
4701840,4706840," So, maybe we can do FFT reset."
4706840,4707840," Maybe clean."
4707840,4708840," Right."
4708840,4714840," So, and in here, essentially, what we have to do, we have to just like mem set to zero all of these three things."
4714840,4717840," I think I can use a little bit of Emacs magic to do that."
4717840,4720840," So, if I do it like that."
4720840,4723840," So, essentially, it's going to be mem set."
4723840,4724840," Yep."
4724840,4729840," So, I'm going to remove that, set it to zero with the size of that."
4729840,4733840," And then, boom, look at that."
4733840,4735840," We just reset all of that."
4735840,4737840," So, that's pretty cool."
4737840,4739840," Key F."
4739840,4740840," Right."
4740840,4746840," The first thing we have to do, we have to clean the FFT state before switching to the rendering state."
4746840,4749840," That's what we do."
4749840,4754840," Then, we have to start the FFMPAC process."
4754840,4757840," We have to start the FFMPAC process."
4757840,4759840," So, let's go ahead and do that."
4759840,4762840," So, we have FFMPAC start rendering."
4762840,4768840," And the question is, the question is, what size do we have to provide?"
4768840,4771840," What size do we have to provide?"
4771840,4778840," We can maybe provide the size of the current window."
4778840,4781840," But the problem is, the size of the window can change."
4781840,4792840," So, and funny enough, funny enough, the visualization very much depends on the size of the window."
4792840,4794840," It very much depends on the size of the window."
4794840,4799840," So, we need to render with a fixed size all the time."
4799840,4801840," So, that's what we need to do."
4801840,4807840," So, what I'm thinking is that maybe we have to render everything into this separate texture."
4807840,4811840," So, the same trick that we've been using to sort of make the animation smooth."
4811840,4816840," By the way, I still don't fucking know why RayLib was not making a smooth thing."
4816840,4818840," But we want to render everything in separate texture anyway."
4818840,4820840," So, maybe that's fine."
4820840,4826840," So, yeah, let's go ahead and create a separate texture for the screen where we're rendering all of that."
4826840,4831840," So, this is going to be renderTexture2D and this is the screen."
4831840,4832840," Right."
4832840,4836840," And when we are initializing the plugin, we need to create that texture."
4836840,4843840," So, this is going to plug screen loadRenderTexture."
4843840,4847840," And we have to provide like a very fixed size."
4847840,4848840," Very fixed size."
4848840,4849840," So, what's going to be that size?"
4849840,4856840," Let's say that it's going to be 16 multiplied by a factor, some sort of a factor, 9 multiplied by some sort of a factor."
4856840,4857840," Right."
4857840,4863840," And factor for now is going to be maybe 60."
4863840,4866840," Maybe a 60."
4866840,4870840," When we're reloading, we don't really need to reload anything."
4870840,4873840," So, we just allocate this texture once and we're just like run with it."
4873840,4875840," So, that's basically what we do."
4875840,4878840," That is basically what we do."
4878840,4884840," And when we're starting ffmpeg, we're going to be supplying the width of that specific texture."
4884840,4888840," So, this is going to be plug screen width."
4888840,4892840," So, I wonder if renderTexture actually has the width inside of it, right?"
4892840,4896840," I know it's a structure, but I don't remember if it has a width."
4896840,4898840," So, renderTexture."
4898840,4899840," Okay."
4899840,4901840," So, it has a texture inside of it."
4901840,4902840," So, we have to go a little bit."
4902840,4903840," Yeah."
4903840,4905840," So, this is where you can have width and height."
4905840,4906840," All right."
4906840,4907840," So, we can do that."
4907840,4908840," Texture."
4908840,4909840," Uh-huh."
4909840,4913840," And similarly, plug screen texture height."
4913840,4915840," So, what's going to be the FPS?"
4915840,4918840," I don't know."
4918840,4920840," Maybe it's going to be some sort of a global parameter."
4920840,4921840," Right."
4921840,4922840," So, it can be fixed."
4922840,4925840," It doesn't really have to be whatever FPS of RayLeap is fixed."
4925840,4926840," Right."
4926840,4929840," It can be our sort of like a renderFPS."
4929840,4930840," Right."
4930840,4931840," So, it's called to renderFPS."
4931840,4934840," And here comes the very interesting thing."
4934840,4937840," We need to supply sound file."
4937840,4940840," But we don't really keep track of the sound file, to be fair."
4940840,4943840," When we load, load music."
4943840,4944840," Right."
4944840,4948840," When we load the music, we just load the music and we forget about it."
4948840,4953840," And I don't think when we load the music, the file path is associated with the music somehow."
4953840,4954840," I don't think so."
4954840,4957840," I don't remember seeing that."
4957840,4958840," So, RayLib."
4958840,4959840," Where is the RayLib?"
4959840,4961840," So, here is the music."
4961840,4962840," Yeah."
4962840,4963840," There's no filing here."
4963840,4966840," So, as soon as you load the music, the file path is lost."
4966840,4967840," So, we don't have that."
4967840,4972840," But we need to provide that to start the FF Impact process, unfortunately."
4972840,4973840," All right."
4973840,4980840," So, one of the things we can do, we can maybe store the file path in the plugin."
4980840,4981840," Like so."
4981840,4983840," Initially, it's going to be null."
4983840,4984840," Right."
4984840,4985840," And look."
4985840,4993840," Essentially, instead of getting the file path into this variable, we're going to save it into the plugin."
4993840,5000840," But we have to be careful because this thing is going to be lost as soon as we unload the dropped files."
5000840,5001840," Right."
5001840,5003840," So, we probably have to do str dupe."
5003840,5004840," Right."
5004840,5010840," But that means we're going to leak a little bit of memory every time we draw a new file in there."
5010840,5014840," So, that means we need to first free whatever we have before that."
5014840,5016840," Whatever we got from the previous str dupe."
5016840,5018840," And only then do the next str dupe."
5018840,5020840," So, that's basically what we do."
5020840,5021840," Right."
5021840,5026840," Initially, a file path is going to be null and passing null to free is actually safe."
5026840,5030840," So, just these two operations is totally safe and it's not going to leak any memory."
5030840,5033840," So, it's not going to like free corrupt memory or anything like that."
5033840,5035840," So, that should be fine."
5035840,5043840," And that also means that we have the file path that we can pass to here."
5043840,5044840," It's that simple."
5044840,5045840," Right."
5045840,5047840," So, we can just do plug file path and there we go."
5047840,5050840," So, we just started the rendering process."
5050840,5052840," So, that's pretty cool."
5052840,5056840," But starting the rendering process actually returns you the pipe."
5056840,5059840," So, we need to save that pipe somewhere."
5059840,5063840," We can also save it in the plugin frame."
5063840,5065840," So, yeah."
5065840,5068840," So, here everything is related to rendering."
5068840,5074840," So, maybe I'm going to put like a group all of the things related to rendering like separately."
5074840,5075840," So, it's clear."
5075840,5076840," So, it's clear."
5076840,5079840," Here we have stuff that is just like general stuff."
5079840,5080840," And here is the rendering."
5080840,5083840," So, in here we need to have a ffmpeg pipe."
5083840,5084840," Right."
5084840,5085840," So, this is a ffmpeg pipe."
5085840,5087840," Maybe we can just call it ffmpeg."
5087840,5088840," ffmpeg."
5088840,5089840," The gut object."
5089840,5093840," I mean, you can think about this thing as a global scope."
5093840,5098840," Like, I just put all of that stuff into a global scope."
5098840,5101840," And the reason why it is in a structure."
5101840,5104840," So, it survives between the plugin reloads."
5104840,5105840," Right."
5105840,5108840," Because we allocate this entire thing in a dynamic memory."
5108840,5109840," Right."
5109840,5111840," And we just keep a pointer to it."
5111840,5114840," And we keep passing that pointer between different versions of the plugin."
5114840,5117840," So, all of that stuff survives between reloads."
5117840,5118840," Right."
5118840,5119840," It's a persistent state."
5119840,5120840," Yeah."
5120840,5122840," So, Neutrix Devs have a persistent state."
5122840,5123840," Yeah."
5123840,5124840," So, essentially that's what it is."
5124840,5129840," So, all of the global variables outside of that structure do not survive hot reloading."
5129840,5130840," Everything inside survives it."
5130840,5132840," So, I wouldn't say it's a gut object."
5132840,5134840," It's just like two global scopes, essentially."
5134840,5135840," Right."
5135840,5137840," Two global scopes."
5137840,5143840," So, here maybe this stuff should also survive hot reloading."
5143840,5144840," To be fair."
5144840,5150840," But that means I have to do six allocations in here for all of these buffers."
5150840,5151840," It's just like..."
5151840,5152840," I don't know."
5152840,5153840," I don't know."
5153840,5154840," I don't know."
5154840,5155840," I don't know."
5155840,5156840," We'll see."
5156840,5157840," We'll see."
5157840,5158840," Okay."
5158840,5159840," So, ffmpeg start."
5159840,5162840," So, and we can just assign plug ffmpeg."
5162840,5163840," All right."
5163840,5172840," So, we cleaned ffmpeg, we started ffmpeg, and we switched to the rendering state, essentially."
5172840,5173840," And that's it."
5173840,5175840," So, we can just start simulating things."
5175840,5180840," We can just start simulating things and send the frames to a corresponding place, I think."
5180840,5181840," Right."
5181840,5185840," But we need to factor out the process of simulation."
5185840,5186840," Right."
5186840,5189840," So, because here, we need to trigger fft analysis."
5189840,5200840," And fft analysis requires to apply the window to the input, then do fft, then squash the algorithmic scale, normalize frequencies, smooth out and sphere values."
5200840,5204840," You know, all that nerdy shed that we looked into in the previous sessions."
5204840,5205840," Right."
5205840,5208840," We need to do that during the rendering as well."
5208840,5215840," So, what I'm thinking is that we need to factor out this sort of stuff into a separate function."
5215840,5216840," So, how are we going to call that?"
5216840,5217840," So, fft clean."
5217840,5221840," Maybe we can call it fft analyze."
5221840,5222840," Analyze."
5222840,5223840," Something like this."
5223840,5224840," Right."
5224840,5228840," And essentially, it's just going to do all of that stuff in there."
5228840,5229840," Right."
5229840,5230840," So, apply the window."
5230840,5236840," Does the actual fft squash, logarithmic scale, smooth out and stuff like that."
5236840,5239840," So, here, it needs the delta time."
5239840,5240840," Right."
5240840,5242840," So, it needs to be aware of delta time."
5242840,5244840," So, that means we'll need to pass it in there."
5244840,5247840," In fact, we'll probably have to pass more stuff in here."
5247840,5250840," So, I'll let the compiler tell me what we have to pass in there."
5250840,5251840," So, it needs fft."
5251840,5256840," So, that means fft, the actual fft, has to be defined a little bit earlier."
5256840,5259840," So, let's go ahead and define it somewhere in here."
5259840,5262840," It needs to be defined a little bit earlier."
5262840,5266840," So, amplitude function has to be defined even earlier than that."
5266840,5267840," It's a very small function."
5267840,5268840," Can we just do static inline?"
5268840,5271840," So, it just like inlines all of these functions all the time."
5271840,5272840," Right."
5272840,5275840," So, I didn't see any reason to not inline that stuff."
5275840,5276840," So, free."
5276840,5277840," It doesn't know what is free."
5277840,5278840," This is because we know..."
5278840,5279840," Really?"
5279840,5280840," It doesn't know what is free?"
5280840,5283840," Oh, this is because the file path is const."
5283840,5284840," Okay."
5284840,5285840," So, it doesn't really have to be const."
5285840,5286840," To be fair."
5286840,5291840," Because strdupe returns non-cost thing anyway."
5291840,5294840," So, that's fine to not keep track of the const."
5294840,5295840," So, I think that's fine."
5295840,5299840," So, fft_analyze, we actually extracted it successfully."
5299840,5302840," So, let me find..."
5302840,5305840," So, that means I can grab this entire stuff."
5305840,5308840," This fft_analysis thing."
5308840,5312840," And just replace it with fft_analyze."
5312840,5316840," And since it accepts delta_time, we can just get the frame time."
5316840,5322840," Since this is the real-time analysis, we get the frame time from ray_leap."
5322840,5323840," Right."
5323840,5325840," We get the frame time from ray_leap."
5325840,5331840," But in the rendering, somewhere here in the rendering, when we're going to be doing the fft_analyze,"
5331840,5335840," we're going to be doing one divided by render_fps."
5335840,5336840," Right."
5336840,5338840," So, it's going to be fixed like that."
5338840,5341840," So, we're not going to call it right now."
5341840,5347840," But this is something just to keep track of, to keep at the back of our heads."
5347840,5351840," So, and this one is rather interesting."
5351840,5358840," So, we have to also do fft_rendering."
5358840,5360840," Oh, shit."
5360840,5363840," By the way, this one is rather interesting."
5363840,5374840," fft_analyze, after squashing the logarithmic scale, it computes the amount of samples in a smaller logarithmic scale."
5374840,5376840," And we kind of lose that information."
5376840,5381840," So, that means we have to return that thing out of this function."
5381840,5382840," Like so."
5382840,5384840," So, then later..."
5384840,5385840," Where is it?"
5385840,5386840," I'm surprised this shit compiled."
5386840,5388840," How the fuck did it compile?"
5388840,5389840," It's..."
5389840,5390840," Yeah, yeah."
5390840,5391840," It's not supposed to compile."
5391840,5392840," How the fuck do you..."
5392840,5393840," Yeah, exactly."
5393840,5394840," That's exactly what I'm talking about."
5394840,5395840," I think I forgot to compile it."
5395840,5396840," Alright."
5396840,5397840," Let's go to the compilation errors."
5397840,5398840," And yeah."
5398840,5402840," So, we don't have m, but we can get the m out of the fft_analyze."
5402840,5403840," There we go."
5403840,5404840," Yeah, boy."
5404840,5406840," So, we don't use that stuff anymore."
5406840,5407840," Alright."
5407840,5410840," Everything is coming together nicely."
5410840,5411840," Okay."
5411840,5417840," So, now I need to take this thing and factor out to like a separate function."
5417840,5418840," something like fft_render."
5418840,5419840," Right."
5419840,5420840," That's what we need."
5420840,5427840," So, fft_analyze and let's do fft_render."
5427840,5430840," So, fft_analyze."
5430840,5434840," Let's just grab all of that stuff in here."
5434840,5439840," All of this rendering and do fft_render."
5439840,5443840," And by the way, I think we'll have to pass m in here."
5443840,5444840," Right."
5444840,5446840," So, we'll have to pass m in here."
5446840,5451840," It actually comes together really nicely."
5451840,5453840," All of the pieces just fall in places."
5453840,5454840," That's kind of cool."
5454840,5459840," I think I over copy-pasted."
5459840,5460840," Shit."
5460840,5461840," Fuck."
5461840,5462840," Damn."
5462840,5463840," Shit."
5463840,5464840," Bravo."
5464840,5465840," Yeah, yeah."
5465840,5466840," I over copy-pasted."
5466840,5467840," God damn it."
5467840,5472840," So, let's try this one more time, but this time do not over copy-paste."
5472840,5473840," Yeah."
5473840,5475840," So, end shader mode."
5475840,5476840," So, here displaying circles."
5476840,5477840," Yeah."
5477840,5478840," Okay."
5478840,5482840," So, that's the last place where we're going to do fft_render."
5482840,5483840," Pass m."
5483840,5484840," Fft_render."
5484840,5489840," So, this is very dangerous operation we're doing right now."
5489840,5493840," We're shuffling around huge pieces of code."
5493840,5494840," This is called refactoring."
5494840,5497840," This is a very important step in our entire process."
5497840,5498840," Right."
5498840,5501840," We're just treating these pieces of code as black boxes and we're shuffling them around."
5501840,5507840," And, of course, when you put them in a different context, they may not compile because of that."
5507840,5511840," So, you have to sort of like stitch together to fit them properly into the new context."
5511840,5513840," But I think we're doing quite fine."
5513840,5514840," Fuck."
5514840,5515840," Okay."
5515840,5521840," So, well, I mean, the only thing we have to provide is just the render width and render height."
5521840,5522840," So, it's not that big of a deal."
5522840,5524840," So, we can just put it in here."
5524840,5525840," Okay."
5525840,5526840," And everything's fine."
5526840,5527840," Everyone come down."
5527840,5528840," Everything's fine."
5528840,5533840," So, moving a huge chunk of code to a different place was not that scary."
5533840,5535840," It was not that scary."
5535840,5536840," Okay."
5536840,5539840," So, everything's working nicely."
5539840,5542840," So, we just done that."
5542840,5543840," Okay."
5543840,5544840," Okay."
5544840,5545840," Okay."
5545840,5546840," Cool."
5546840,5551840," So, when we switch to a separate, like to a rendering state, the first thing we do in this"
5551840,5556840," rendering state, we are just telling the user that we are rendering shit."
5556840,5557840," Right."
5557840,5558840," We are rendering shit."
5558840,5561840," And while we are rendering shit, we need to do FFT analyze."
5561840,5562840," Right."
5562840,5563840," We do FFT analyze."
5563840,5565840," And does FFT analyze accept?"
5565840,5566840," Yeah."
5566840,5567840," So, it accepts the delta time."
5567840,5568840," Okay."
5568840,5569840," Yeah."
5569840,5570840," We already have that and stuff in here."
5570840,5574840," So, it also returns like how many squashed samples we have and we do FFT render."
5574840,5577840," And here comes the punchline."
5577840,5579840," We need to do that FFT render."
5579840,5584840," The same FFT render we do up there, but inside of the frame buffer."
5584840,5585840," Right."
5585840,5588840," So, we need to do begin, texture mode, plug, screen."
5588840,5589840," Right."
5589840,5590840," So, there you go."
5590840,5591840," You have a screen."
5591840,5594840," And then you render this entire thing in there."
5594840,5596840," This one is rather interesting, by the way."
5596840,5604840," Because when we have to render it, as I already mentioned, we must render it with a fixed size."
5604840,5605840," And here, I made a huge mistake."
5605840,5608840," I'm rendering with the size that we get from Raylib."
5608840,5609840," No, no, no."
5609840,5612840," This is not how it works, mind of render."
5612840,5613840," This is not."
5613840,5615840," We have to do this kind of shit."
5615840,5616840," Right."
5616840,5617840," So, we have to pass it like that."
5617840,5618840," Right."
5618840,5626840," And depending on the context where you preview or actually render in the final video, you have to render for different resolutions."
5626840,5628840," We have to render for different."
5628840,5630840," This is very fucking important."
5630840,5631840," Okay."
5631840,5632840," So, let's go to the computation errors."
5632840,5633840," Okay."
5633840,5634840," So, this is the context."
5634840,5635840," What is this context?"
5635840,5636840," This is context of preview."
5636840,5639840," In the preview, we're doing getRenderWidth."
5639840,5644840," So, we take the width of the window and height of the window."
5644840,5645840," So, that's totally fine."
5645840,5646840," Okay."
5646840,5653840," But in the context of final rendering, we have to take the width and height of the texture into which we're rendering all that."
5653840,5654840," This is very important."
5654840,5657840," Different contexts, different parameters."
5657840,5660840," The same thing with FFT Analyze."
5660840,5667840," When we're previewing, we're doing the delta time of the array, of the actual window, refresh window and stuff like that."
5667840,5670840," When we are doing like a final rendering, it's fixed."
5670840,5674840," It's fixed to whatever FPS we want to render it into."
5674840,5675840," Very important."
5675840,5678840," So, the same with the resolution."
5678840,5683840," So, in different contexts, these parameters are different."
5683840,5684840," Okay."
5684840,5687840," So, in here, we end the texture mode."
5687840,5692840," So, and here, we have a texture that contains the pixels of the current frame."
5692840,5694840," It contains the pixels of the current frame."
5694840,5700840," So, the only thing that is left is to grab those mother flipping pixels with load image from texture."
5700840,5701840," Like so."
5701840,5705840," We grab those mother flipping pixels and we have to send them down the pipe."
5705840,5712840," Just like shove it down the ffmpeg pipe so it can render, encode that frame and save it into the file system."
5712840,5713840," Okay."
5713840,5715840," So, here is an interesting thing."
5715840,5721840," We're using write, which is a Linux specific syscall."
5721840,5725840," And I'm trying to not use anything Linux specific in this place."
5725840,5726840," All right."
5726840,5730840," I'm trying to put everything Linux specific to ffmpeg Linux."
5730840,5739840," So, that means that maybe we need to create another function."
5739840,5740840," Right."
5740840,5742840," Something like ffmpeg send frame."
5742840,5743840," You know what I mean?"
5743840,5744840," You know what I mean?"
5744840,5745840," You know what I mean?"
5745840,5749840," So, and essentially here, you have to provide the pipe."
5749840,5750840," Right."
5750840,5754840," So, the pipe that you created with this thing when you started the process."
5754840,5759840," And you have to provide the data, the pixels themselves, and width and height."
5759840,5760840," Right."
5760840,5762840," So, this is what we're going to do."
5762840,5764840," So, and then I'm going to go to Linux in here."
5764840,5765840," I'm just going to do it like that."
5765840,5772840," And we can take this very Linux specific piece of scheisse and copy it there."
5772840,5775840," And it's pretty safe to do this kind of stuff in here."
5775840,5776840," Right."
5776840,5778840," So, and what we'll have to do in the future."
5778840,5782840," In the future, we'll have to go through all of these three functions and implement them for Windows."
5782840,5785840," Because on Windows, these kind of things are going to be different."
5785840,5786840," Right."
5786840,5788840," So, that's very important, my friend."
5788840,5789840," That's very important."
5789840,5791840," So, okay."
5791840,5792840," So, this is going to be data."
5792840,5793840," This is just width."
5793840,5795840," This is just height."
5795840,5797840," And I think that's it."
5797840,5798840," Right."
5798840,5801840," So, essentially what we can say, instead of doing it like that, we can say,"
5801840,5806840," FFM pack, send frame, plug FFM pack."
5806840,5812840," And we do image data, image width, and image height."
5812840,5813840," Boom."
5813840,5814840," That's right."
5814840,5816840," And we have to not forget to unload the image."
5816840,5817840," Right."
5817840,5819840," So, otherwise we're going to leak some memory."
5819840,5821840," That's pretty cool."
5821840,5822840," Isn't this?"
5822840,5823840," I think it is."
5823840,5826840," Maybe we can even outline with stuff like this."
5826840,5828840," So, it makes a little more sense."
5828840,5829840," Right."
5829840,5830840," So, as you can see, we do FFT analysis."
5830840,5836840," Then we render our FFT visualization into this texture."
5836840,5838840," And then we get the pixels of the texture."
5838840,5841840," And we send in those pixels to the FFM pack."
5841840,5843840," And then we're going to repeat that on the next iteration."
5845840,5850840," In fact, we can keep rendering these textures."
5850840,5851840," Yeah."
5851840,5853840," We can keep rendering these textures on the screen."
5853840,5856840," So, we can see what is the current frame that we are visualizing."
5856840,5858840," That is not a bad idea, honestly."
5858840,5862840," But since the window can be of different sides, it's kind of difficult."
5862840,5864840," You'll have to feed that thing."
5864840,5865840," Right."
5865840,5867840," You'll have to feed that thing."
5867840,5870840," So, let's try to compile this entire thing and see if it compiles."
5870840,5871840," Alright."
5871840,5874840," So, you don't have to provide this thing in here."
5874840,5876840," So, you have to provide one in here."
5876840,5878840," And it seems to be compound."
5878840,5879840," Okay."
5879840,5880840," That's pretty cool."
5880840,5881840," That is pretty cool."
5881840,5884840," But there is one problem in here."
5884840,5885840," There is one problem in here."
5885840,5890840," We don't handle the sound."
5890840,5894840," We do FFT analysis."
5894840,5896840," But FFT analysis of what?"
5896840,5900840," FFT analysis of what exactly?"
5900840,5901840," Excuse me."
5901840,5903840," Like, what exactly are we analyzing?"
5903840,5907840," So, to analyze something, we should have something in this buffer."
5908840,5911840," But while we're rendering, nothing puts anything into that buffer."
5911840,5915840," When we do preview, we have a callback."
5915840,5919840," That is called by the sound subsystem every time something needs to be played."
5919840,5921840," And it gives us a bunch of frames."
5921840,5924840," It gives us a bunch of frames."
5924840,5930840," And we just put those frames into that input row and then we can analyze that."
5930840,5935840," But in case of the rendering, the final render of the video, nothing is playing."
5935840,5942840," And in fact, nothing should be playing because we are synchronizing the sound perfectly to the frames."
5942840,5943840," Right."
5943840,5948840," So, how can we solve that?"
5948840,5952840," We need to have this frame somewhere."
5952840,5955840," Like the sound frames loaded somewhere."
5955840,5958840," As far as I know, we have a music."
5959840,5962840," Music doesn't keep the entire file in memory."
5962840,5963840," So, that's the problem."
5963840,5966840," It kind of loads it lazily as it's playing."
5966840,5970840," So, it's not particularly useful for analyzing in offline."
5970840,5974840," We need to load the wave of that sound separately."
5974840,5978840," As far as I know, ArrayLib introduces a notion of a wave."
5978840,5980840," Right."
5980840,5985840," That basically, literally contains the samples of the sound file that you just loaded."
5985840,5987840," So, and there is a thing like load wave."
5987840,5990840," And you can take any file and it just like loads it."
5990840,5991840," And you can analyze it."
5991840,5993840," It's like loading pixels from the image."
5993840,5995840," So, you can just load this kind of stuff."
5995840,5996840," And this is what we can do."
5996840,5997840," We can just load it."
5997840,5998840," We can just load it."
5998840,6004840," And as we generate the frames, we can iterate through these samples of this wave."
6004840,6007840," And just like put it into FFT and analyze them ourselves."
6007840,6009840," So, here's the interesting thing."
6009840,6014840," In a preview, it's the sound subsystem that gives us the frame."
6014840,6022840," But when we're rendering the flying, it's us who constantly pulling the sound."
6022840,6024840," It's kind of interesting, right?"
6024840,6025840," It's a different API."
6025840,6030840," So, in the first case, we were just like using callback."
6030840,6032840," We didn't have to worry about anything."
6032840,6035840," So, all of that stuff was handed to us."
6035840,6040840," But now, it's us who has to constantly pull that stuff from the sound."
6040840,6042840," It's kind of interesting."
6042840,6050840," So, speaking of different sizes, will it support perspective mapping?"
6050840,6051840," Depends on what exactly do you mean."
6053840,6054840," What exactly do you mean?"
6054840,6055840," Perspective mapping."
6055840,6059840," So, it doesn't matter what you're visualizing."
6059840,6062840," Really."
6062840,6067840," FFmPack doesn't give a shit what exactly is on the screen."
6067840,6070840," As far as it's concerned, it's just pixels."
6070840,6073840," You can put whatever you want in there."
6073840,6079840," You can have 3D, 4D, 5D, some crazy non-Euclidean shit."
6079840,6081840," It doesn't give a shit."
6081840,6082840," Really."
6082840,6090840," So, write whatever code you want that puts 2D pixels and we can just give it to FFmPack and it will give you a final video."
6090840,6091840," It doesn't care."
6091840,6092840," It doesn't matter."
6092840,6093840," So, that's what's cool about it."
6094840,6095840," Yes."
6095840,6096840," Yes."
6096840,6097840," Yes."
6097840,6098840," Yes."
6098840,6099840," Yes."
6099840,6100840," Yes."
6100840,6102840," What do you send to FFmPack?"
6102840,6104840," Array of pixels or images?"
6104840,6106840," What's the difference exactly?"
6106840,6110840," What's the difference between array of pixels and images?"
6111840,6118840," I would say that I'm sending array of pixels."
6118840,6121840," For me, images are array of pixels."
6121840,6123840," Images can be compressed."
6123840,6124840," Oh, yes."
6124840,6126840," We're sending array of pixels, right?"
6126840,6127840," So, we're not…"
6127840,6131840," The format is raw pixels, if that's what you mean."
6131840,6132840," So, what's the format?"
6132840,6133840," The format is raw pixels."
6133840,6136840," And we can even take a look at that stuff."
6136840,6137840," So, yeah."
6137840,6142840," We specifically say that the format of the pixels is RGBA and the format of the whole video is raw video."
6142840,6148840," That means that it literally expects a sequence of 32-bit RGBA, right?"
6148840,6156840," So, these two flags mean that you just send 32 bits constantly and it will just interpret that as images."
6161840,6164840," So, that's what's cool about FFmPack, right?"
6164840,6169840," It is width, height, RGBA."
6169840,6171840," Yeah, it's that simple, surprisingly."
6171840,6176840," So, it's pretty cool that you can do this kind of stuff as FFmPack."
6176840,6182840," The bad part is that it's not really documented well anywhere, right?"
6182840,6192840," You can only find this kind of information in some, like, you know, some weird, like, lost stack overflow answer by somebody."
6192840,6193840," And it's just like…"
6193840,6197840," Yeah, it's like there's no, like, a proper tutorial that explains you anything like that."
6197840,6199840," It's just like you can stumble upon that accidentally."
6199840,6200840," Right."
6200840,6202840," But FFmPack can do that."
6202840,6203840," FFmPack can do that."
6203840,6205840," It's actually pretty cool."
6205840,6206840," All right."
6206840,6211840," So, we need to load the wave, right?"
6211840,6214840," So, we need to load the wave."
6214840,6215840," Just a second."
6215840,6216840," I need to sneeze."
6216840,6217840," Thank you very much."
6217840,6218840," All right."
6218840,6232840," So, we need to have a wave and rendering true."
6232840,6235840," So, I suppose what we can do…"
6235840,6237840," We already have a file path."
6237840,6238840," Thank you."
6238840,6239840," Thank you."
6239840,6240840," Thank you."
6240840,6242840," We already have a file path."
6242840,6249840," So, that means we can just do wave, load wave, plug, file path."
6249840,6250840," Look at that."
6250840,6252840," And we have a wave."
6252840,6257840," And that means here, what we have to do, we have to just analyze it."
6257840,6263840," So, but to analyze it, we have to, like, do this weird stuff."
6263840,6264840," Where is the weird stuff?"
6264840,6265840," Where is the callback?"
6265840,6271840," So, yeah, we need to be able to do this kind of thing."
6271840,6278840," Maybe I can factor out this process by saying something like FFT push."
6278840,6280840," Yeah, FFT push."
6280840,6285840," Where I'm going to accept, like, a single frame that you push in there."
6285840,6288840," And it's going to do this kind of stuff automatically for you."
6288840,6292840," So, I can call this thing during the final rendering."
6292840,6298840," So, end frame in here is just frame."
6298840,6301840," And here is just FFT push."
6301840,6304840," And the frame we're pushing is this one."
6304840,6306840," Yeah, there we go."
6306840,6313840," So, that means now, here, what I can do is just do this kind of thing."
6313840,6316840," Because we're analyzing the frames of the..."
6316840,6320840," So, here's the problem."
6320840,6325840," Both video and sound use the word frame."
6325840,6328840," And they mean different things."
6328840,6337840," In the context of sound, frame is a pair of samples for left and right channels."
6337840,6342840," So, essentially, sound consists of samples."
6342840,6343840," Ah, what the fuck."
6343840,6345840," It consists of samples."
6345840,6347840," And they're usually interleaved."
6347840,6354840," So, it's usually left, right, left, right, left, right, and so on and so forth."
6354840,6359840," So, each individual sort of value is called sample."
6359840,6364840," And the pair of values, like left and right, are called frames."
6364840,6369840," So, essentially, wave contains the sound frames."
6369840,6372840," So, like, the terminology is super confusing."
6372840,6375840," I really apologize for that."
6375840,6376840," But, yeah."
6376840,6379840," So, and here comes another problem."
6379840,6389840," When the sound subsystem calls our callback, it gives us normalized sound frames."
6389840,6394840," They're normalized from -1:1, regardless of the format of the music."
6394840,6401840," But, if I'm not mistaken, the wave is not normalized."
6401840,6410840," So, depending on the sample size, the data actually points to samples of different sizes of different types."
6410840,6414840," So, that means we have to normalize it ourselves?"
6414840,6415840," But, I don't think so."
6415840,6418840," I think there was something that kind of decodes that."
6418840,6420840," We can try to find it."
6420840,6422840," So, where's my Google?"
6422840,6423840," Yeah, here's the Google."
6423840,6431840," So, let's say that we accept wave and return, like, a float."
6431840,6432840," Is there something like that?"
6432840,6433840," Oh, yeah."
6433840,6434840," Okay."
6434840,6437840," So, load samples data from wave as 32-bit."
6437840,6438840," Okay."
6438840,6440840," So, you can actually take the wave samples and normalize them."
6440840,6442840," So, let me take a look at how it works."
6442840,6444840," Now, does it actually normalize this thing?"
6444840,6446840," So, that's actually super useful."
6446840,6447840," Include."
6447840,6448840," No, no, no."
6448840,6449840," So, let's go to software."
6449840,6450840," RayLip."
6450840,6453840," And it's going to be src."
6453840,6458840," So, rm."
6458840,6461840," Where is the implementation?"
6461840,6462840," Okay."
6462840,6464840," So, it allocates some additional memory."
6464840,6465840," Okay, cool."
6465840,6466840," And, alright."
6466840,6467840," Look at that."
6467840,6469840," That's actually kind of funny."
6469840,6471840," So, it reads through all of the samples."
6471840,6473840," Like, it's through all the frames, by the way, right?"
6473840,6475840," It takes the frame count, multiplies this by channel, right?"
6475840,6479840," Because depending on the amount of channel, the size of the frame is different."
6479840,6484840," And depending on the sample size, it just reinterprets the data differently"
6484840,6488840," and divides it by different values to normalize it from -1 to 1."
6488840,6489840," Okay."
6489840,6490840," So, we already have this kind of thing."
6490840,6492840," So, we don't really have to do that."
6492840,6495840," Okay."
6495840,6496840," And it also allocates the memory."
6496840,6499840," So, it has to be freed with unload wave sample."
6499840,6500840," This is very important."
6500840,6503840," So, we should not forget to do that at some point."
6503840,6504840," Alright."
6504840,6505840," So, that's pretty cool."
6505840,6506840," That's exactly what we need."
6506840,6511840," So, we can even have something like, I don't know, float wave samples."
6511840,6517840," And after we load the wave, we can do load wave samples."
6517840,6519840," We provide the plug wave."
6519840,6522840," We're going to keep track of this wave because we'll need to deallocate it later."
6522840,6524840," And we're going to reassign it to wave samples."
6524840,6527840," So, we have the samples as floats."
6527840,6529840," So, yeah."
6529840,6531840," Another thing we need to keep track of."
6531840,6535840," We need to keep track of the current sample that we're currently processing."
6535840,6536840," Right."
6536840,6538840," So, because we're iterating through the sound samples."
6538840,6539840," Right."
6539840,6541840," So, we need to somehow keep track of that."
6541840,6542840," Oh, boy."
6542840,6543840," Okay."
6543840,6545840," So, let me see."
6545840,6549840," So, wave cursor."
6549840,6559840," But as we start rendering, as we start rendering, the wave cursor has to be reset to zero because"
6559840,6560840," we're starting like over."
6560840,6561840," I think it's quite important."
6561840,6562840," Right."
6562840,6564840," So, this is the wave cursor."
6564840,6567840," Then loading the wave, loading the sample."
6567840,6568840," And, yeah."
6568840,6569840," Everything seems to be nice."
6569840,6571840," Everything seems to be nice."
6571840,6572840," Okay."
6572840,6581840," So, now we need to decide how many samples we want to push into FFT for a single frame."
6581840,6583840," For a single frame."
6583840,6584840," This is very important."
6584840,6587840," So, how many frames we have at all?"
6587840,6592840," We have plug, wave, frame count, I believe."
6592840,6597840," This is how many sound frames we have."
6597840,6603840," Essentially, we probably need to have a sample rate."
6603840,6604840," Right."
6604840,6605840," So, sample rate."
6605840,6606840," Yes."
6606840,6607840," Here's the sample rate."
6607840,6612840," So, this is how many samples there are per one second."
6612840,6614840," Per one second."
6614840,6619840," So, if we divide it by renderFPS."
6619840,6620840," RenderFPS."
6620840,6624840," This is how many samples we have to process per frame."
6624840,6627840," So, this is sort of like a single chunk."
6627840,6629840," Chunk size."
6629840,6637840," This is literally how many samples we have to push into FFT with FFT push before we analyze it."
6637840,6639840," So, that's what we have to do."
6639840,6645840," So, we can basically iterate from zero to chunk size plus plus pi."
6645840,6648840," And I suppose we can essentially..."
6648840,6650840," Well, we need to take the samples, right?"
6650840,6654840," So, wave samples."
6654840,6657840," And depending on the amount of channels, we have to reinterpret it differently."
6657840,6660840," So, this is something that we did in a callback."
6660840,6662840," This is something that we did in a callback."
6662840,6664840," So, I can basically grab this thing."
6664840,6668840," But if I understand correctly, it's going to be different depending on the amount of channels."
6668840,6669840," So, we have to be super careful."
6669840,6672840," So, this is basically channels."
6672840,6674840," Yeah, like this."
6674840,6675840," There we go."
6675840,6677840," So, this is basically channels."
6677840,6682840," And we have to do plug wave samples."
6682840,6684840," Okay, that's cool."
6684840,6687840," So, this is the samples."
6687840,6694840," And essentially, we start with plug wave cursor."
6694840,6695840," So, this is the sample."
6695840,6700840," And we need to push that thing into the FFT."
6700840,6705840," And afterwards, we have to increment it by one."
6705840,6708840," So, we have to be a little bit careful."
6708840,6716840," Because at this point, wave cursor can go outside of the frame count, right?"
6716840,6718840," It can go outside of the frame count."
6718840,6721840," So, that means we have to do the following thing."
6721840,6725840," If this thing is less than the frame count."
6725840,6729840," So, it's going to plug wave frame count, right?"
6729840,6730840," So, this is the frame count."
6730840,6732840," We just push this thing."
6732840,6738840," Otherwise, I guess we can just push zero."
6738840,6745840," So, it's very important because the whole amount of frames may not be divisible by the chunk size."
6745840,6749840," So, there will be some sort of a trail that we need to like pad with zeros."
6749840,6751840," And that's why I'm doing it like that."
6751840,6754840," So, we'll need to pad it with zeros."
6754840,6759840," So, we also need to check."
6759840,6761840," We also need to check."
6761840,6764840," Did we finish rendering at all?"
6764840,6766840," Did we finish rendering at all?"
6766840,6776840," So, we finished rendering, I suppose, when the plug wave cursor is greater or equal to plug wave frame count."
6776840,6781840," Right, as soon as we reach that, we finished rendering."
6781840,6783840," And we need to do something in here."
6783840,6787840," So, essentially what we need to do, we just need to deallocate all of the memory that we allocated."
6787840,6789840," So, we need to unload the wave."
6789840,6791840," Right, we need to unload the wave."
6791840,6794840," Unload wave samples."
6794840,6796840," So, let me see."
6796840,6798840," What else did we allocate, by the way?"
6798840,6800840," We allocated a lot of things."
6800840,6801840," Let me see."
6801840,6803840," So, wave samples."
6803840,6804840," Wave."
6804840,6806840," We need to close ffmpack, right?"
6806840,6809840," So, if we take a look at ffmpack.h."
6809840,6812840," We need to say end rendering."
6812840,6813840," All right."
6813840,6817840," We're ending the rendering plug ffmpack."
6817840,6819840," And I guess that's it."
6819840,6824840," So, we don't really need to deallocate anything else anymore."
6824840,6826840," Yeah, that's fine."
6826840,6831840," So, and the last thing we have to do, we have to go out of the rendering mode by setting it to false."
6831840,6834840," There we go."
6834840,6839840," So, as soon as we reach this thing, we finish the rendering."
6839840,6841840," But if we not, we keep rendering."
6841840,6846840," So, essentially, we just print like a render that we're currently rendering in the video."
6846840,6850840," Then we push a little bit of data into the fft."
6850840,6852840," We do fft analysis."
6852840,6854840," Then we render everything."
6854840,6855840," And then we save the frames."
6855840,6858840," And we keep repeating that over and over again."
6858840,6859840," Okay."
6859840,6861840," That should be it."
6861840,6864840," So, let's try to compile this entire thing and see if it works or not."
6864840,6865840," I don't know."
6865840,6866840," Maybe it does."
6866840,6867840," Okay."
6867840,6871840," So, wave sample c, I suppose."
6871840,6872840," What else do we have in here?"
6872840,6875840," fs, incompatible pointer, blah, blah, blah."
6875840,6879840," I suppose I can just like cast it to void star."
6879840,6881840," And void star is assignable to any pointer."
6881840,6882840," So, that should be fine."
6882840,6888840," So, this one is fs float parameter."
6888840,6889840," Oh, okay."
6889840,6892840," So, because we have to pick one of the channels left and right."
6892840,6893840," Okay."
6893840,6895840," So, that seems to be compatible."
6895840,6896840," Alright."
6896840,6902840," That's a really weird contraption that we just came up with."
6902840,6905840," That's a really weird contraption."
6905840,6906840," Okay."
6906840,6907840," So, let me see."
6907840,6912840," When we are rendering, what's the actual size of rendering we have?"
6912840,6913840," When I do screen."
6913840,6914840," Just a second."
6914840,6916840," Plug init."
6916840,6921840," I don't want to have a very big rendering size."
6921840,6922840," Okay."
6922840,6923840," You know what?"
6923840,6926840," I think we need to introduce something like render width."
6926840,6930840," Render width and render height."
6930840,6931840," Render width and render height."
6931840,6934840," And here we're going to have it along with render FPS."
6934840,6941840," Render width is going to be factor."
6941840,6944840," Maybe render factor."
6944840,6945840," 16."
6945840,6949840," 9 height."
6949840,6954840," Define render factor is going to be 16."
6954840,6955840," Nothing particularly special."
6955840,6957840," Let's try to compile this entire thing."
6957840,6959840," And that should be it."
6959840,6960840," I'm a little bit scared actually."
6960840,6961840," Alright."
6961840,6963840," So, it should be already working."
6963840,6965840," It should be already working."
6965840,6966840," Right."
6966840,6968840," So, let me do mutualizer."
6968840,6969840," Okay."
6969840,6978840," So, let's press F."
6978840,6980840," Broken pipe."
6980840,6981840," Okay."
6981840,6982840," X lib."
6982840,6983840," Holy shit."
6983840,6984840," Alright."
6984840,6986840," File loaded successfully."
6986840,6989840," Could not run FFF."
6989840,6990840," as a child."
6990840,6991840," Bad address."
6991840,6992840," Unknown sequence number while processing queue."
6992840,6993840," Most likely this is a multi-threaded client."
6993840,6994840," Has not been called."
6994840,6995840," Sorry about that."
6995840,6996840," That is actually."
6996840,6997840," Yeah."
6997840,6998840," That's exactly what I was talking about."
6998840,6999840," That's exactly what I was talking about."
6999840,7000840," That's exactly what I was talking about."
7000840,7001840," What I was talking about."
7001840,7001840," That's weird."
7001840,7001840," Like, what the fuck."
7001840,7001840," So, let me see."
7001840,7001840," Resolution."
7001840,7002840," So, we rendered everything."
7002840,7003840," Okay."
7003840,7004840," So, let's try to do that second time."
7004840,7005840," Right."
7005840,7007840," So, let's try to do that second time."
7007840,7008840," Right."
7008840,7009840," So, to see."
7009840,7010840," And."
7010840,7011840," Yeah."
7011840,7012840," Yeah."
7012840,7012840," It's the same thing."
7012840,7013840," Yeah."
7013840,7014840," It's the same thing."
7014840,7017840," So, let's try to do that second time."
7017840,7018840," Right."
7018840,7019840," So, to see."
7019840,7020840," And."
7020840,7021840," Yeah."
7021840,7025840," It's the same thing."
7025840,7026840," Okay."
7026840,7031840," So, let's try to do that second time."
7031840,7032840," Right."
7032840,7033840," So, to see."
7033840,7034840," And."
7034840,7035840," Yeah."
7035840,7038840," It's the same thing."
7038840,7045840," It specifically cannot run ffmpeg at all."
7045840,7046840," But."
7046840,7050840," If we go back to our small example that we had in there."
7050840,7051840," Right."
7051840,7053840," So, ffmpeg rendering with ffmpeg."
7053840,7054840," So, main.c."
7054840,7056840," So, I have."
7056840,7057840," Yeah."
7057840,7060840," I have a couple of things in here."
7060840,7061840," Oh."
7061840,7063840," It's a wrong one actually."
7063840,7064840," So, sorting."
7064840,7065840," Ffmpeg."
7065840,7070840," Apparently, I already had this clone, but it was in a different folder."
7070840,7071840," Alright."
7071840,7073840," So, let me do build.sh."
7073840,7075840," So, yeah."
7075840,7079840," Essentially, I just copy pasted some shit."
7079840,7082840," So, let me bring that shit back."
7082840,7084840," Let me bring that shit back."
7084840,7091840," So, let me close it in here."
7091840,7095840," So, it must be something with the way I call ffmpeg."
7095840,7096840," Yeah."
7096840,7099840," It must be something with the way I call ffmpeg."
7099840,7100840," Because here."
7100840,7101840," It's."
7101840,7102840," It was working."
7102840,7103840," Right."
7103840,7104840," We were calling ffmpeg fine."
7104840,7105840," And as you can see, it is working."
7105840,7106840," Alright."
7106840,7107840," Alright."
7107840,7108840," Alright."
7108840,7109840," Alright."
7109840,7110840," Alright."
7110840,7114840," So, and if we take a look at this thing."
7114840,7115840," Alright."
7115840,7116840," So, that's fine."
7116840,7123840," So, let's compare how we call to ffmpeg here and in that place."
7123840,7126840," So, what's the differences between those things?"
7126840,7127840," Uh-huh."
7127840,7129840," So, it's been residing."
7129840,7130840," Musializer."
7130840,7131840," SRC."
7131840,7132840," Ffmpeg."
7132840,7133840," Linux."
7133840,7135840," And what do we have in there?"
7135840,7140840," So, verbose, wire, raw, video."
7140840,7144840," The only difference here we do is a resolution."
7144840,7146840," We're rendering this as a resolution."
7146840,7150840," And a frame rate in this snprintf."
7150840,7153840," But that shouldn't be a problem."
7153840,7156840," Maybe this is because of this thing."
7156840,7159840," I'm also not sure."
7159840,7163840," I'm also not sure."
7163840,7166840," So, uh-huh."
7166840,7171840," Ffmpeg end rendering."
7171840,7174840," Maybe we end rendering too early."
7174840,7179840," So, if we go to the plugin."
7179840,7181840," I don't see any problem, honestly."
7181840,7184840," Like, what is wrong in here?"
7184840,7190840," So, maybe we end the rendering too early."
7190840,7198840," What if we just, like, don't call to this thing?"
7198840,7200840," Framerate instead of FPS?"
7200840,7201840," What?"
7201840,7203840," What are you talking about?"
7203840,7205840," Did I not notice something?"
7205840,7206840," What?"
7206840,7207840," What?"
7207840,7208840," What?"
7208840,7209840," What?"
7209840,7210840," What?"
7210840,7211840," Wait."
7211840,7213840," What the fuck is FPS?"
7213840,7214840," Why did it..."
7214840,7218840," Why did the compiler just..."
7218840,7220840," This is because it's a very..."
7220840,7222840," Holy shit."
7222840,7223840," God damn C."
7223840,7224840," I hate this language."
7224840,7225840," Oh my God."
7225840,7226840," Oh my God."
7226840,7227840," This is so freaking bad."
7227840,7237840," Like, it literally allows you to put any shit in here because it's a very addict and it's not even checked at runtime."
7237840,7238840," It's so bad."
7238840,7239840," Very addicts and Cs suck."
7239840,7240840," Holy fuck."
7240840,7243840," Thank you so much whoever said that in the chat."
7243840,7244840," Thank you so much."
7244840,7245840," Oh."
7245840,7246840," All right."
7246840,7247840," So, yeah."
7247840,7248840," It's insane how bad it is."
7248840,7249840," All right."
7249840,7251840," So, let's go ahead and try to do that."
7251840,7252840," Okay."
7252840,7253840," We are rendering."
7253840,7255840," We are fucking rendering, motherfuckers."
7255840,7256840," Fucking rendering."
7256840,7257840," All right."
7257840,7258840," All right."
7258840,7259840," All right."
7259840,7260840," All right."
7260840,7261840," All right."
7261840,7262840," All right."
7262840,7266840," So, as far as I know, what's the length of that specific thing?"
7266840,7267840," So, yeah."
7267840,7269840," It's insane how bad it is."
7269840,7270840," All right."
7270840,7272840," So, let's go ahead and try to do that."
7272840,7273840," Okay."
7273840,7274840," We are rendering."
7274840,7275840," We are fucking rendering, motherfuckers."
7275840,7276840," Fucking rendering."
7276840,7277840," The length of that specific thing."
7277840,7280840," So, music."
7280840,7281840," Just another."
7281840,7282840," Null."
7282840,7283840," VIP."
7283840,7284840," Where's VIP?"
7284840,7285840," Just another."
7285840,7286840," There we go."
7286840,7287840," Ffprobe."
7287840,7288840," Right."
7288840,7289840," Ffprobe."
7289840,7290840," What's that?"
7290840,7291840," What's the length?"
7291840,7292840," It's 30 seconds."
7292840,7293840," Okay."
7293840,7295840," We're looking for 30 seconds."
7295840,7296840," Yeah."
7296840,7297840," So, okay."
7297840,7299840," So, it's almost done rendering."
7299840,7302840," So, it needs to be 30 seconds in here."
7302840,7303840," Yo."
7303840,7304840," What's up?"
7304840,7305840," What's up?"
7305840,7311840," Is it done?"
7311840,7312840," Oh, fuck."
7312840,7313840," It didn't."
7313840,7314840," Oh, shit."
7314840,7315840," Yeah."
7315840,7318840," We didn't we enable, disable?"
7318840,7320840," We freaking disabled it."
7320840,7323840," But I mean, it should actually finish rendering fine."
7323840,7324840," I think."
7324840,7325840," Okay."
7325840,7326840," So, here's the output mp4."
7326840,7327840," Yeah."
7327840,7329840," It didn't properly finish it."
7329840,7335840," So, we need to recompile it one more time and try to do that one more time."
7335840,7337840," Because we didn't finalize everything."
7337840,7338840," Right."
7338840,7339840," We should have actually finalized it."
7339840,7340840," Um."
7340840,7341840," Yeah."
7341840,7342840," Are we setting everything?"
7342840,7343840," Okay."
7343840,7344840," Okay."
7344840,7345840," Okay."
7345840,7346840," That's fine."
7346840,7347840," Uh-huh."
7347840,7348840," Uh-huh."
7348840,7349840," Uh-huh."
7349840,7350840," So, let's do it like that."
7350840,7353840," And let's try to do that one more time."
7353840,7354840," Uh-huh."
7354840,7355840," Uh-huh."
7355840,7356840," Okay."
7356840,7357840," Let's render."
7357840,7358840," Boom."
7358840,7359840," Uh-huh."
7359840,7370840," Why run ffmpeg command instead of using their API?"
7370840,7372840," Because it fucking sucks my ass."
7372840,7373840," That's why."
7373840,7377840," Uh-huh."
7377840,7383840," That's literally the reason."
7383840,7387840," That's literally the reason everyone uses ffmpeg instead of their API."
7387840,7389840," Not only me."
7389840,7391840," It's nothing unheard of."
7391840,7394840," The API fucking sucks ass."
7394840,7397840," To the point that it's literally easy to just run ffmpeg separately."
7397840,7398840," Seriously."
7398840,7401840," That's how bad it is."
7401840,7402840," So."
7402840,7405840," It's so bad."
7405840,7407840," I tried to do that."
7407840,7408840," Even successfully."
7408840,7409840," Look at that shit."
7409840,7411840," Even successfully."
7411840,7412840," Um."
7412840,7414840," And it's just bad."
7414840,7415840," Um."
7415840,7416840," Okay."
7416840,7417840," Okay."
7417840,7418840," So."
7418840,7418840," Uh."
7418840,7419840," Let me see."
7419840,7430840," Okay."
7430840,7431840," Not bad."
7431840,7432840," That's already not bad."
7432840,7433840," Uh."
7433840,7436840," We just need to clean this screen every time."
7436840,7437840," Uh."
7437840,7438840," Right."
7438840,7439840," Every time we're like rendering the next frame."
7439840,7441840," This is nothing special."
7441840,7442840," Uh."
7442840,7443840," All right."
7443840,7445840," It is really easy to fix."
7445840,7446840," So."
7446840,7447840," Essentially."
7447840,7449840," When we're rendering this entire thing."
7449840,7450840," Before rendering."
7450840,7451840," All right."
7451840,7452840," Just clean the screen with the background color."
7452840,7453840," Very easy to fix."
7453840,7454840," Uh."
7454840,7455840," All right."
7455840,7456840," One more time."
7456840,7457840," Uh huh."
7457840,7458840," Uh huh."
7458840,7459840," Uh huh."
7459840,7460840," All right."
7460840,7461840," So."
7461840,7464840," Let's take a look at the video itself."
7464840,7465840," Uh."
7465840,7465840," This is video."
7465840,7466840," It's a little bit jerky."
7466840,7467840," Is it a thing?"
7467840,7468840," It's kind of weird."
7468840,7469840," It's a little bit jerky."
7469840,7469840," It's a little bit jerky."
7469840,7470840," Is it a thing?"
7470840,7471840," It's kind of weird."
7471840,7472840," It's a little bit jerky."
7472840,7473840," It's a little bit jerky."
7473840,7474840," Is it a thing?"
7474840,7475840," It's a little bit jerky."
7475840,7476840," Is it a thing?"
7476840,7477840," It's kind of weird."
7477840,7478840," It's a little bit jerky."
7478840,7479840," It's a little bit jerky."
7479840,7480840," Is it a thing?"
7480840,7481840," It's kind of weird."
7481840,7482840," Uh huh."
7482840,7483840," It's a little bit jerky."
7483840,7484840," Is it a thing?"
7484840,7485840," It's a little bit jerky."
7485840,7486840," Is it a thing?"
7486840,7487840," It's a little bit jerky."
7487840,7488840," Is it a thing?"
7488840,7489840," It's a little bit jerky."
7489840,7490840," Is it a thing?"
7490840,7491840," It's kind of weird."
7491840,7492840," It's a little bit jerky."
7492840,7493840," Is it a thing?"
7493840,7494840," It's kind of weird."
7494840,7505840," Okay."
7505840,7506840," So."
7506840,7508840," It also finishes too early."
7508840,7509840," Before."
7509840,7511840," The FFT sort of settled down."
7511840,7512840," Um."
7512840,7513840," Um."
7513840,7516840," So maybe this is something that we want to do in here."
7516840,7517840," Uh."
7517840,7520840," Essentially wait until it's settled down."
7520840,7521840," Uh."
7521840,7523840," So how can we do that?"
7523840,7526840," Essentially the definition of settled downed."
7526840,7533840," Both smoothing and smear became zero or small enough."
7533840,7534840," Right."
7534840,7537840," So this is one of the things we can do."
7537840,7540840," So essentially FFT settled."
7540840,7541840," Uh."
7541840,7542840," Alright."
7542840,7543840," And we can just do."
7543840,7544840," Uh."
7544840,7545840," To be fair."
7545840,7547840," We need to maybe accept."
7547840,7548840," Damn."
7548840,7549840," Um."
7549840,7551840," How can we easily do that?"
7551840,7552840," Because it's kind of."
7552840,7553840," You know."
7553840,7554840," We need to know M."
7554840,7557840," So we can decide whether it is settled or not."
7557840,7558840," Uh."
7558840,7559840," We can do N."
7559840,7560840," Right."
7560840,7561840," So we can just iterate the whole range."
7561840,7562840," It's not that big of a deal."
7562840,7563840," So."
7563840,7564840," Um."
7564840,7565840," Um."
7565840,7566840," Um."
7566840,7567840," Um."
7567840,7568840," Um."
7568840,7569840," So."
7569840,7570840," Um."
7570840,7571840," Um."
7571840,7572840," Um."
7572840,7573840," Um."
7573840,7574840," Um."
7574840,7575840," Um."
7575840,7576840," Um."
7576840,7577840," So when essentially if."
7577840,7578840," Out smooth."
7578840,7579840," I."
7579840,7584840," Is greater than certain epsilon."
7584840,7586840," We say that it's false."
7586840,7587840," We're not settled yet."
7587840,7589840," And the same with smear."
7589840,7590840," Um."
7590840,7591840," And if."
7591840,7592840," We went through all this stuff."
7592840,7593840," Uh."
7593840,7594840," Without treating any of this condition."
7594840,7595840," That means we settled."
7595840,7596840," And."
7596840,7598840," Let's say that epsilon is going to be."
7598840,7599840," Um."
7599840,7600840," Maybe."
7600840,7601840," One."
7601840,7602840," Thousand."
7602840,7603840," Something like that."
7603840,7604840," Right."
7604840,7605840," So."
7605840,7606840," And essentially here."
7606840,7607840," Uh."
7607840,7608840," We're."
7608840,7609840," Keep doing all of that."
7609840,7610840," Uh."
7610840,7611840," While."
7611840,7614840," Wave cursor is less than frame count."
7614840,7615840," Um."
7615840,7616840," And."
7616840,7617840," FFT."
7617840,7618840," Not settled."
7618840,7619840," Right."
7619840,7620840," So if it's greater."
7620840,7621840," And."
7621840,7622840," FFT settled."
7622840,7623840," Only then."
7623840,7624840," We finish the rendering."
7624840,7626840," Only then we finish the rendering."
7626840,7627840," So interesting enough."
7627840,7628840," If we go."
7628840,7629840," Over."
7629840,7630840," Uh."
7630840,7631840," We just keep."
7631840,7632840," Adding zeros in here."
7632840,7633840," So at the end."
7633840,7634840," Like."
7634840,7635840," It's going to pad everything with zeros."
7635840,7636840," So it's fine."
7636840,7637840," It should be fine."
7637840,7638840," At least."
7638840,7639840," Hopefully."
7639840,7640840," Um."
7640840,7641840," So."
7641840,7642840," Yeah."
7642840,7644840," So this is a wave cursor."
7644840,7647840," It looks a little bit weird."
7647840,7648840," The final thing."
7648840,7649840," Looks a little bit weird."
7649840,7650840," So."
7650840,7651840," I'm not really sure."
7651840,7652840," What's up with that."
7652840,7653840," Uh."
7653840,7654840," Alright."
7654840,7655840," So."
7655840,7656840," One more time."
7656840,7658840," One more time."
7658840,7660840," I really like the sample."
7660840,7661840," Because it's small enough."
7661840,7662840," Right."
7662840,7663840," It's only 30 seconds."
7663840,7664840," It takes that much time."
7664840,7665840," To render it."
7665840,7667840," How's it going everyone?"
7667840,7669840," I tried different codecs."
7669840,7670840," To improve the video."
7670840,7671840," But the video quality."
7671840,7672840," Is not the problem."
7672840,7673840," That we're having."
7673840,7674840," Is it?"
7674840,7675840," So."
7675840,7676840," Why do I."
7676840,7677840," Troubleshoot the problem."
7677840,7678840," That doesn't exist right now."
7678840,7679840," What's."
7679840,7680840," What's the point of doing that."
7680840,7681840," Excuse me."
7681840,7688840," What's the problem we're having right now?"
7688840,7689840," Oh yeah."
7689840,7690840," So basically."
7690840,7691840," You know."
7691840,7692840," Settling."
7692840,7695840," Why are you guys suggesting me to troubleshoot problems that I don't have?"
7695840,7696840," Like."
7696840,7697840," What's wrong with that?"
7697840,7698840," Like."
7698840,7701840," The quality of the video is not a problem that I'm having right now."
7701840,7702840," Like."
7702840,7703840," It's literally not a problem."
7703840,7706840," The problem is that the video cuts to earlier."
7706840,7707840," Like."
7707840,7708840," What the fuck are you troubleshooting?"
7708840,7709840," I don't understand."
7709840,7712840," So weird."
7712840,7729840," It looks weird."
7729840,7730840," Honestly."
7733840,7734840," There we go."
7734840,7735840," So."
7735840,7736840," It actually settled."
7736840,7737840," But."
7737840,7738840," The."
7738840,7739840," The final thing looks really fucking bizarre."
7739840,7740840," Yeah."
7740840,7741840," So."
7741840,7742840," Look."
7742840,7743840," Pay attention to."
7743840,7744840," This thing in here."
7744840,7745840," Like."
7745840,7746840," This thing."
7746840,7747840," This end."
7747840,7748840," If you can see it."
7748840,7749840," Of course."
7749840,7750840," Because maybe."
7750840,7751840," Because of the."
7751840,7752840," Like."
7752840,7753840," The rendering and stuff."
7753840,7754840," It's."
7754840,7755840," It's not visible."
7755840,7756840," There we go."
7756840,7757840," So."
7757840,7758840," It actually settled."
7758840,7759840," But."
7759840,7760840," The final thing looks really fucking bizarre."
7760840,7761840," Yeah."
7761840,7762840," So."
7762840,7763840," It's."
7763840,7764840," But."
7764840,7765840," Here."
7765840,7766840," That end."
7766840,7767840," Keeps jumping."
7767840,7769840," There is some sort of a bug in here."
7769840,7772840," There is some sort of a bug."
7772840,7773840," Like."
7773840,7774840," It's really clear."
7774840,7775840," Because in the actual."
7775840,7776840," Preview."
7776840,7777840," There is no such thing in here."
7777840,7778840," Yeah."
7778840,7779840," So."
7779840,7780840," FFT is not doing the same frequency."
7780840,7781840," So."
7781840,7782840," There's some."
7782840,7783840," There are some discrepancies."
7783840,7784840," So."
7784840,7785840," We don't really know."
7785840,7786840," What exactly."
7786840,7787840," Is going on."
7787840,7788840," Why are they like that?"
7788840,7789840," Uh."
7789840,7790840," Maybe we're just like."
7790840,7791840," Not converting everything properly."
7791840,7792840," Or something else."
7792840,7793840," So."
7793840,7794840," We need to."
7794840,7795840," Like."
7795840,7796840," Analyze this."
7796840,7798840," We need to analyze this."
7798840,7799840," This."
7799840,7800840," A little bit."
7800840,7801840," Alright."
7801840,7802840," After."
7802840,7803840," You know."
7803840,7804840," Some time."
7804840,7806840," Trying to figure all that out."
7806840,7807840," We found the problem."
7807840,7808840," The problem was."
7808840,7809840," That."
7809840,7809840," We."
7809840,7810840," Were not stopping."
7810840,7811840," The."
7811840,7812840," Music."
7812840,7813840," Or."
7813840,7813840," Like."
7813840,7814840," Before starting."
7814840,7815840," The rendering."
7815840,7816840," And apparently."
7816840,7817840," For whatever reason."
7817840,7818840," Ray leap."
7818840,7819840," Keeps calling."
7819840,7820840," The callback."
7820840,7822840," Which keeps messing with."
7822840,7823840," With the data."
7823840,7824840," That is used."
7824840,7825840," For."
7825840,7826840," Offline rendering."
7826840,7827840," So."
7827840,7828840," Even though."
7828840,7829840," We don't really call."
7829840,7830840," Update music stream."
7830840,7831840," And I thought that."
7831840,7832840," If you don't call."
7832840,7833840," Update music stream."
7833840,7834840," The callback is not going to be called."
7834840,7835840," It was not enough."
7835840,7836840," Apparently."
7836840,7837840," Like."
7837840,7838840," You literally have to stop."
7838840,7839840," The music stream."
7839840,7840840," To."
7840840,7841840," To make it work."
7841840,7842840," Properly."
7842840,7843840," And that."
7843840,7844840," Fixes this problem."
7844840,7846840," And it renders everything."
7846840,7847840," Perfectly."
7847840,7850840," So yeah."
7850840,7851840," That's."
7851840,7852840," I suppose."
7852840,7853840," It."
7853840,7854840," For today."
7854840,7855840," So."
7855840,7856840," We need to think."
7856840,7857840," So the rest of the stuff."
7857840,7858840," That we'll need to do."
7858840,7859840," Is probably."
7859840,7860840," Maybe."
7860840,7861840," Wire up."
7861840,7862840," Probably."
