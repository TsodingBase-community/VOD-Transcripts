160,6400," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreation programming session with Amista Azozin."
6400,12240," So, today it's too hot to do any serious software development so what I decided to do, I decided to"
12240,19600," do some low effort language review slop and the target of today's stream is going to be this thing"
19600,25040," that I heard about some time ago but I, you know, just brushed it off because it's a yet another"
25040,32160," so-called ckiller but it looks like a pretty good target for our language review slop. So, yeah,"
32160,38640," so let's actually read about it. So, C3 programming language, a simple, fast, safe, compiled, wow,"
38640,47440," for developing maintainable software. Not readable, mind you, only maintainable. They said nothing about"
47440,55040," readable. So, yeah, it looks like... I don't even know what it looks like. Is that right?"
55040,64880," What's the point of fn keyword if you just like using... This is basically C but with an unnecessary"
64880,70720," additional fn keyword like it's just like you can remove fn keyword and have sort of like a backward"
70720,78000," compatibility with C. It's just like... Okay, so it has modules. It has modules so you can have a module"
78000,83680," system and stuff like that. So, it's already better than C. So, it has modules. It's already better than C."
83680,89440," You can have namespaces. You can finally separate RayDeep into a different namespace so it doesn't collide"
89440,96000," with Win API. That's already a win in my opinion. That's already a win. Right, so let's actually get"
96000,103360," started. Why is it bright? I specifically requested like a dark mode. Like, why don't you..."
103360,109600," This is what you get when C developers start developing websites. Right, so you get stuff like that."
109600,118640," Anyways, so... Okay, but how do I install this shit? Excuse me. Okay, I'm gonna go back. So,"
118640,124640," get started doesn't really get you started. Okay, so here is the installation guide. Okay, so you have"
124640,136160," Debian. Specifically Debian. Not just Linux. Debian. And we are, as far as I know, on Debian."
136160,146000," Okay, so let's actually download. So, we... So, it's a Linux star. Okay, so we're downloading. Okay,"
146720,154960," Okay, so we got the Tor. We got Tor. Okay, so let's go. So, I'm gonna go into the downloads. Let me take a"
154960,160400," look. So, where are we gonna put all that? So, I think I want to create like a separate sort of like a folder and"
160400,169920," So, I'm gonna call it C3 probe. And I'm gonna just move this entire thing in here. And let's do unboxing."
169920,175920," Are you guys ready? Are you guys ready for unboxing experience of a programming language?"
175920,182160," So, let's go ahead and just like... All right. So, the root folder is called Linux."
182160,190000," Not even a C3 Linux. Or it's just... It's just Linux. We just downloaded the source code of Linux,"
190000,195200," apparently. That's what happened. All right. So, I'm gonna rename it to just something like C3 Linux,"
195200,200240," so I can like distinguish it. Like, I mean, the archive itself is already called C3 Linux. You could"
200240,206800," have like just call it like that at least. Okay, so we've got a single executable and msvc"
206800,212000," build libraries.py on fucking Linux build."
212000,222000," I'm on Linux. Guys, I'm on Linux. What msvc?"
222000,228880," What the fuck is this? Okay, wait. I want to open it. Like,"
228880,236640," script based on this thing. Okay, so what is that? So, it's based on some sort of like a gist."
236640,242880," Right. So, you need msvc for Linux? Or it's just like, what the fuck is going on?"
242880,247360," Don't msvc compile linker windows SDK without installing full visual studio."
247360,253120," All right. That's fine. It's just like it doesn't affect anything. It's just like looks a little bit"
253120,258720," silly, right? It just looks a little bit silly. So, we have an executable C3C, right? So, we can take a"
258720,268640," look at what it is. It is, in fact, elf69bitlsbpy executable x8664 version 1sv dynamically. Disgusting."
268640,274880," Dynamically linked. How are you supposed to create a self-contained software if you dynamically link"
274880,279760," with things? Absolutely disgusting. Anyway, that's fine. I'm joking actually. So, let's actually take a"
279760,285040," look at what kind of dependencies do we have in here. Not that many. Not that many dependencies. So, we have a"
285040,293520," compiler that depends on libxml2. This compiler, for whatever reason, needs to be able to parse xml files."
293520,301040," I have no idea why, but it needs to be able to parse xml files. Maybe because it integrates"
301040,306960," with msvc, actually. Because as far as you know, msvc projects, there are xml files, aren't they? I think"
306960,314240," they are. So, just in case it does that. But, I mean, we are on Linux. Again, so that doesn't explain"
314240,319840," shit. Maybe the standard library sort of has something. But, I mean, the compiler doesn't"
319840,324080," need to have a libxml. I don't know. Maybe it's configured to xml."
331920,337840," Okay. You guys are funny. You guys are funny. Okay. So, let's actually try to run this executable and see if"
337840,346080," it even runs on my machine. It seems to be right. Okay. So, okay. It has a system of subcommands. So,"
346080,354800," you basically compile a file, right? You can initialize projects. You can build and stuff like that. So, it feels a little"
354800,364480," bit like go. It feels a little bit like go-ish, right? So, okay. So, let's take a look at hello world."
364480,369920," No, no, no, no, no, no. So, what I'm going to do, I'm going to create hello c3 and I'm going to actually"
369920,376880," save it as an empty file. So, let's do an empty file test. How this language will react an empty file,"
376880,382800," right? So, will it give any useful information? So, because it's kind of cool. It would be cool to have"
382800,388880," a language that you just start with an empty file and the error messages are descriptive enough that"
388880,394720," you can actually figure out how to create an entry point without even looking into the documentation,"
394720,399680," just by looking at the error messages, right? So, it would be kind of cool if there was a language that"
399680,404160," can achieve that, right? So, let's actually see. Oh, you're supposed to actually say something like"
404160,412640," compile. Okay. No main function was found. Compilation, only object files are generated. Okay. So,"
412800,418880," I'm going to go... Oh, shit. What the fuck?"
418880,432720," Lib... This thing that just barfed. It just..."
435360,445680," What the fuck am I even looking at? Bro. There's so many of them. Holy shit. Okay. So,"
445680,452400," if I take a look at... What the fuck is this? It's almost a megabyte of files. Like,"
452400,459440," I created an empty file. I tried to compile just an empty file and it just barfed into the current folder."
459440,462960," Almost a megabyte of object files of different things."
462960,470400," I don't know what's up with that. I honestly don't know what's up with that. But we're going to just"
470400,478880," keep it, right? So, it's understandable for like a compiler to just have some sort of artifacts of"
478880,484400," compilation. Jai does stuff like that. As far as I know, Jai tries to keep them in a separate sort of like"
484400,492560," a dot build folder, right? So, it may barf a bunch of stuff, but it will barf it into a separate sort of"
492560,500000," like a bag, right? Into a separate sort of folder. So, to not disturb your current folder, right? I think"
500000,509280," it's a little bit more civil. So, anyways, let's actually see. So, it wants a main function. So, from the"
509840,514000," promotional material, from promotional material, I kind of vaguely remember that you're supposed to"
514000,521120," put fn void. Oh, we don't even have a highlighting, guys. We don't even have a syntax highlighting."
521120,525600," Okay. So, let's actually try to do something like this. And let's try to compile it one more time. So,"
525600,532960," what is it going to do? Program linked to executable hello. Okay. So, all the object files just like"
532960,539200," sucked up into the executable, right? So, I suppose they're sort of like an intermediate things."
540800,544960," Right. So, everything got sucked up into the executable. All right. So, fair enough."
544960,550560," Now, let's take a look at the executable that we've got in here. All right. So, it's a 64-bit alpha"
550560,555040," executable. It's dynamically linked and stuff like that. Nothing particularly special. And what does it"
555040,565200," depend on? What does it depend on? It depends on the libc. It depends only on libc. So, it's almost statically"
565200,572080," linked. Almost. They couldn't get rid of libc, which is understandable. On Linux, it's kind of"
572080,578480," difficult to get rid of libc, right? So, it's almost like it's the Win API of Linux, right?"
578480,584480," The libc is the Win API of Linux. There's nothing much you can do. What was their libc. Oh, if it links"
584480,591760," with libc? I have no idea. Like, I'm seeing this entire shit for the first time. This is literally my"
591760,598080," first impression of this thing. Like, I don't know anything about it. Right. Never tried it locally"
598080,604720," in the machine. I only read documentation a little bit in the past, but that's about it."
604720,610320," Okay. So, let's actually try to run this entire thing. And it's not supposed to do anything, right?"
610320,615600," So, it's not supposed to do anything. So, I remember you do something like I/O, println,"
615600,621440," something like your mom. Right. So, let's actually see if it's going to compile. Okay. So,"
621440,629120," expected. Look at that. Look at that. So, it tells you precisely where you expect the semicolon."
629120,634240," Props for error messages. Props for error messages. Okay. Okay. So, let's see. Okay. So,"
634240,643760," ioprintln could not be found. Did you spell it right? Asking rhetorical questions. Asking rhetorical"
643760,651600," questions. I don't know. Like, did I? Do I have to maybe import this entire thing? Yeah. So,"
651600,656160," I have to actually do the import. Okay. So, let's actually try to do it one more time. Okay. So,"
656160,668880," is it not println? It's just, oh, it's a printn without l. Okay. So, all right. Fair enough. Fair enough."
668880,678480," All right. So, I wonder if I don't import and just do std, right? Is it going to? No. In a module. So,"
678480,689120," you have to explicitly import it like that. Okay. So, I got a hello world. It seems good. It seems"
689120,694400," uh, Tamaguchi. But I want to have like a little bit of an extension or like mode. So, let's see"
694400,702320," if the mode for this thing is available in the in the packages, in Melpa packages. So, let me do C3"
704000,707520," mode. There's no mode in here. So, let me go to Melpa."
707520,716560," Is this another Rayleap speedrun, by the way? I don't know, honestly. So, we can try to link with"
716560,721680," uh, with Rayleap. So, I don't really know how to link with external libraries in here. So, we'll see."
721680,728800," We'll see. So, C3. So, there's no C3 mode in here. So, maybe we can find something,"
729680,736560," uh, something on the interwebs. Something on the interwebs. C3 mode emacs."
736560,747920," Um, so, can I, by the way, have a dark mode in here? Thank you so much. Uh, yeah. Apparently,"
747920,758960," we just can't have the editor support for this thing. Um, okay. So, C3. Maybe it's a C3C mode."
759680,766960," Um, no, it doesn't, it doesn't know that. What about Google? Maybe Google can answer that twice?"
766960,777760," No. So, all right. So, C3, uh, language, GitHub. Maybe they have some sort of like, yeah, yeah. So,"
777760,784960," this is what I'm talking about. They have a GitHub. So, maybe they have an extension somewhere there. Um,"
785680,793040," So, there's a Docker, dependencies, minis, SSC, wrappers, resources. Don't really see anything."
793040,796880," So, there's some sort of like, they, they ported Quake or something. Like,"
796880,802240," wait, did they rewrite it in Quake? Or what's up with this screenshot?"
806320,813760," What's up with this? Like, what does it have to do with this? It's, uh, I don't know, man. It's,"
813760,816560," it's kind of bizarre. But anyway, so maybe it's in organization."
818640,829440," uh so editor plugins okay we found something bravo bravo bravo emacs look at that look at that we"
829440,837280," found emacs okay so uh obviously i probably want to actually give the link to the editor plugins in"
837280,843520," here right in the description uh so that's what we found this this is where we found all that"
844160,858160," so this had simple syntax highlighted voices yeah this is exactly what"
858160,870160," am i famous or something it's just like this is the last thing i actually expected"
874160,880160," uh what the i like i mean i'm glad that it was useful"
880160,884800," i'm actually glad it was useful okay uh"
884800,896880," all right all right fair enough it does look like it it does look like it uh yep yep thank you all right"
898000,906880," so let me quickly give it the star uh right and obviously like so far from what i from what i can"
906880,911920," see this language already deserves the star right it works so you can like write hello world in it like"
911920,920240," it's a it's a language um so i'm gonna give it the star already uh don't know if it's gonna become the"
920240,926400," actual c killer or anything like that uh none of the languages actually do become c killers i don't"
926400,934080," think it's possible to see to kill c at this point already um but i mean just augment it just kind of"
934080,940160," augment it maybe it is possible um all right so let's do a double get and let's just double get this into i"
940160,954000," all right so and in here um so here we have where is the jai mode we can just simply do require c3 mode"
954000,961680," right so i can just enable that and when i go to hello c3 and i revert this entire thing look at that"
961680,968320," look at that we've got the syntax highlighting we've got the syntax highlighting so i can already"
968320,973200," uh work with this language i can already work with this language all right pretty cool pretty cool pretty"
973200,978880," cool so what kind of stuff we can do in this language right so there's some examples uh what"
978880,986400," kind of examples okay so you have if conditions you have four loops which are classical uh classical"
986400,992560," for loops uh from c so with like this three part initialization condition and increment okay"
993440,1001600," fair enough honestly it looks like c except that single fn keyword this is something that they don't"
1001600,1007840," understand if you're trying to look like c just go all the way through why introducing that additional"
1007840,1015280," keyword i do not fully understand is that to sort of like resolve some sort of like um syntactical"
1015280,1020160," ambiguity in c or something like maybe yeah so this is what i was thinking about maybe for function"
1020160,1025440," pointers because function pointers syntax in c or is kind of s yeah people are talking about like"
1025440,1031280," there is a for each in here yeah that's actually pretty cool uh so maybe this is needed to resolve"
1031280,1037280," some sort of like a assness of the uh function point of syntax maybe that's the case uh you have"
1037280,1041600," numerations and you can even specify the type of the underlying type of the enumeration that's"
1041600,1047040," already pretty cool that's already pretty cool so here are the switch cases and stuff like that so"
1047040,1058160," that that's a c c plus plus killer right there this c plus plus killer right there because one of the"
1058160,1065920," killer feature of c plus plus was what destructors array so basically you can deallocate some resources"
1065920,1071360," when you reach the end of the scope and they were always bragging and uh you know acting like i have a"
1071360,1078240," they have a moral high ground over c for that feature not anymore we've got deferred we've got"
1078240,1085840," already better than c plus plus already better than c plus plus so yeah defer um okay struck types i mean"
1085840,1092080," everybody has struck types function pointers uh yeah okay so you you were right by the way you were right"
1092080,1100320," so it just makes it easier to maybe define function point depth so it's sort of like a redefinition of"
1100320,1112000," some sort so you're so maybe it's a type definition or or whatever so error handling oh okay so errors are"
1112000,1118960," handling using optional suffix denoted with so it's sort of like an in hair or whatever yeah okay i see"
1119200,1126080," all right okay okay okay okay okay okay so there's this kind of stuff uh this kind of stuff"
1126080,1135840," all right contracts wait a second uh pre and post conditions are optionally compiled into asserts"
1135840,1137840," helping helping to optimize the code"
1137840,1150000," ensure and they're part of like a comment in here what is this java stuff"
1150000,1158400," so you put this kind of stuff into a comment but because it's at it's sort of like an attribute"
1158960,1166000," so some external tools may probably inspect that and maybe bake that or what is what is this java"
1166000,1171760," what what java is doing in my c killer excuse me"
1171760,1181360," this is like java what like imagine like programming ccc all of a sudden java"
1185680,1189920," brother um where's that meme from by the way"
1189920,1196320," it's such a fun okay i see everyone actually like reposting that like a brother"
1209040,1214320," uh all right uh all right so there's some macros micro arguments may be immediately evaluated okay"
1214320,1225920," this is actually super cool wait a second uh so macro and so i suppose it's like literally like"
1225920,1233920," substituted in here and macros are not just some stinky preprocessor they're part of the language"
1234960,1239920," they're part of the language this is what i this is i can respect actually"
1239920,1251840," some sexy macros damn some sexy sexy macros all right so methods"
1259520,1267280," but i mean okay so this is kind of a questionable feature right so but but it works like in go right"
1267280,1274160," so i don't really see any like that much point in in methods to be fair uh right there's just like a"
1274160,1281600," syntax an alternative syntax to uh to calling a function because at the end of the day right so how"
1281600,1284800," something like this is different than something like this is different than something like this"
1284800,1291680," it's just like it's just an alternative syntax it's just an alternative syntax and it's just like"
1291680,1298720," uh maybe some people like it because you can sort of like chain you can sort of like chain this kind"
1298720,1305840," of thing right and it feels cool uh it's almost it feels uh as cool as for example chaining the commands"
1305840,1311680," in bash right so you can have command foo then you pipe it into bar into buzz and you you build this"
1311680,1318000," sort of like a chain thingy so it kind of feels cool you feel smart and maybe because of that people"
1318000,1324480," also like methods i personally just like an alternative syntax right so uh but whatever whatever it's fine"
1324480,1339440," it's fine uh compile time reflect so wait a freaking second that is fucking sexy mate look at that you"
1339440,1349120," have a macro print fields and it accepts a type you take members of that type and you just iterate them"
1349120,1356000," at compile time you iterating fields over type at compile time in the context of the macro and"
1356000,1362800," what you're doing in here i suppose since it's like a macro for each right so it has a dollar in front"
1362800,1368960," of it so i suppose it's an indication that it's a macro for each so you're basically generating this"
1368960,1376720," ioprint offense statements right and basically it's almost like you iterate you like manually printed each"
1376720,1381920," an individual field of this thing and and and and for each that is kind of bizarre honestly"
1381920,1393600," that is honestly a bizarre syntax uh in all fairness in all fairness what's if macro system if a macro"
1393600,1402240," system part of your language what's so difficult of doing something like this right"
1405920,1410560," what what what's so difficult of just like doing the why do you have why do you need to have this"
1410560,1417120," kind of thing i honestly don't understand like at the end of the day you have curly braces in here"
1417120,1424560," but not here so what what's the logic behind this right so why don't just like do that in here"
1424560,1429680," and that looks cleaner in my opinion it just looks cleaner"
1431760,1441200," looks cooler um it's not a scope ah but i mean it's kind of it's kind of obvious to me that what this"
1441200,1448560," loop does it just generates like emits this print fn statements so i personally would have not been"
1448560,1455840," confused by these curly braces if they didn't really generate a scope in the generated code like i don't know"
1455840,1460720," maybe there is some sort of like a deep reasoning behind doing it this way but i mean i'm like looking"
1460720,1465280," this language at the surface level right so i didn't really know the deep reasoning behind all"
1465280,1472240," these decisions but at the first glance as a first impression it kind of looks sus that's what i'm saying"
1472240,1479920," it's a cool concept don't get me wrong it's a pretty sexy macro stuff right so some sexy pretty macro stuff"
1480480,1486960," but at the surface level this kind of thing looks a bit sus that's what i would say it looks a bit sus"
1486960,1494320," it could have been like i think cleaner but whatever uh okay so compile time execution okay so through the"
1494320,1500800," macros you can just do compile time execution fair fair we already kind of see that so and again this one"
1500800,1510000," actually yeah so it's it follows the same sort of logic all of these compile time constructions they"
1510000,1519200," don't use curly braces interestingly so it's sort of like a reoccurring uh theme throughout the language"
1519200,1527680," right so you have a um runtime language and you have compile time language and compile time language is"
1528880,1537280," like it's syntactically distinct sort of speak maybe that's the point of this entire stuff uh compile time"
1537280,1544080," turing completeness i mean that's a thing that you want to have actually so you want to have a compile time"
1544080,1554720," turing completeness um after decades and decades of software development we software developers came to a"
1554720,1563840," conclusion that yes we want to have a full-fledged turing complete language at compile time we do want to"
1563840,1572160," have that but we need to do a lot of complicated at compile time so i see nothing wrong with that"
1572160,1579360," sorry i literally see nothing right there benefits are overwhelming yeah exactly so this is the reason why"
1579360,1588320," we have build build build systems literally build systems are a symptom of us wanting to have a turing"
1588320,1594480," complete language at compile time so we're just looking for for solutions yeah it's literally a hack for"
1594480,1605280," to having that um so if we just had languages that could do whatever you want at compile time maybe we"
1605280,1612000," would have never had such over complicated build systems right so which are basically stacks of"
1612000,1618160," generators on top of generators on top of generators on top of generators uh right so because at the end of"
1618160,1628960," the day we just want to do some stuff at compile time um yeah so okay generic modules oh i forgot that this"
1628960,1638000," thing has modules and you can have this is summer camel type shit look at that summer camel type shit"
1638000,1645280," i can respect that so it's basically modules that are parameterized with some stuff and you can instantiate"
1645280,1649840," these modules okay fair fair fair uh dynamic holes"
1649840,1654960," a little bit of a polymorphism"
1654960,1663280," a little bit of a polymorphism look at that so that means it it probably creates a v table or something"
1663280,1667840," right so you can have an inter okay so you can even explicitly say that this thing is dynamic"
1668480,1675600," uh right so yeah okay so interesting interesting interesting interesting okay so we went through"
1675600,1685920," all of the props to the creators um for this page this page is awesome honestly i really like that that"
1685920,1691760," they can just like basically have a tour of the language i just go through this examples i just scroll"
1691760,1696320," also them okay so and i'm having like a tour of like through the through through the language very"
1696320,1703120," useful actually uh very useful so now i have a like rough idea what language is capable of uh without"
1703120,1707760," reading the entirety of the reference guide or anything it's just like yeah so you can do that you"
1707760,1715600," can do that that that and that right okay so so far so so good like i really like this language so far and how"
1715600,1721440," everything is organized and everything so they have a fiq maybe we can read the fiq uh what's the most"
1721440,1726800," fundamental modules in the standard library std core blah blah blah i'm not really interested in that"
1726800,1733360," how the string works define a native string type string which is a distinct char because char is"
1733360,1739520," essentially a pointer plus length uh some care has to be taken to ensure that the pointer is properly"
1739520,1745440," managed okay so i'm not really interested in any of that stuff so this slices okay so"
1745440,1756080," the the examples were not uh the full sort of like um uh tour in here oh i remember i remember this"
1756080,1764960," shit it has built-in vectors it has built-in vectors so this is one of the reasons why i wanted to do"
1764960,1771920," a review this language right so it has this built-in type of vectors so you can say so it's a vector of two"
1771920,1778320," integers and what's interesting is that it has mathematical operations defined on them and you"
1778320,1785520," can do swizzling holy fucking shit so essentially you can yeah you can do jl cell stuff basically in that"
1785520,1793840," language so yep that's pretty cool that's pretty cool so i i don't even need a vector type from"
1793840,1801360," god damn ray leap i don't even need that i don't need that thing uh so speaking of ray lip right so we"
1801360,1808640," need to probably link with the radio how easy it is to link with the radio by the way how easy it is"
1809440,1819280," uh so yeah so save all that stuff save save what the is going on so maybe i think my emacs"
1819280,1828720," huh i think my emacs is dying it's just got stuck for whatever reason okay i'm gonna keep emacs"
1830240,1841360," uh so let me go to probe c3 probe okay oh yeah so i have some weird shit now because emacs died"
1841360,1853760," uh okay so now what i wanted to do i wanted to take a look at this thing so uh link um"
1855280,1865360," so you can pass uh linker built-in cc custom default is c custom requires a path link with the library"
1865360,1872960," provided so it does have some stuff for linking with libraries uh which is kind of cool all right so"
1872960,1877920," let me go ahead and just download ready uh array san"
1880240,1882320," call race and five really"
1882320,1893440," so let's take a look at releases so we didn't have releases in this year of review"
1893440,1904320," uh link and really let's go i just want to see how easy it it is to just do that right so i wonder if"
1904320,1912000," if it is easy to just link with some c libraries uh all right so i'm gonna do wget and i'm gonna just"
1912000,1919520," download this thing i should have actually done that with uh with the ampersand so i can see you know"
1919520,1925680," the background job happening so there's also this leap thing here right so i suppose that this is the"
1925680,1930480," standard library and this is the stuff that we have in the standard library we have math we have"
1930480,1939600," leap c uh by the way leap c is going to be super useful for ffi stuff all right so okay"
1939600,1944880," i already know how to forward declare ray leap functions"
1944880,1953360," that was easy actually i don't even need documentation so here it is so this is a leap c dot c3"
1953360,1958640," so if i want it to have an external function this is how i would do that so it's an extern"
1958640,1964400," and then just like like this uh that's pretty cool so i'm going to use that as an example to do that"
1964400,1968880," all right so here is the array leap and let's just maybe unpack ready"
1968880,1979120," okay good so this is what we have in here this is what we have uh and what i'm thinking is i want to do"
1979120,1989120," compile uh right so hello c3 and i'm going to say just link this entire stuff with uh maybe lib array"
1989120,1997840," lib uh a right so what does it say cannot process a known option okay so it's probably is not done like"
1997840,2005120," this uh right we have to do it like that okay so that's cool so cannot find library lib a no such file"
2005120,2012080," or directory perfect right so it probably needs a path to where find all of that so let's provide the path"
2012080,2021120," the path is going to be here uh oh that was interesting so it still couldn't find that so"
2021120,2026320," that path thing was not particularly helpful um that's interesting"
2029040,2036960," okay okay so but what if i don't provide the path like uh path separately what if i just say okay link"
2036960,2045760," with this full path all right so it worked so i didn't even need like a capital l i could just say"
2045760,2052960," link with that path and it will just link it with with this thing um all right so uh it's probably"
2052960,2057600," completely eliminated dependency on the valley because we don't really use anything for from that"
2057600,2067280," thing and i wonder if i can uh actually link with so dynamic link can i link with this so then i can"
2067280,2072160," and the question is does it depend on anything from it doesn't depend on anything in here"
2072160,2080000," anyways so let's go ahead and maybe um you know try to initialize a window or something like that so"
2080000,2088560," can i can i say extern fn void um init window right so we're gonna say init window and if i remember"
2088560,2098880," correctly if we take a look at the array libs you know signature init window so the thing about the"
2098880,2105440," signature in here is that it accepts the pointer to character and i don't really know"
2106800,2117120," how to work with c strings in cp3 but as already said we can actually look it up in the standard"
2117120,2124400," library of libc we can just literally look it up so we can just provide the pointers uh so first of all"
2124400,2135840," integers have to be c int like so so they have to be c int so what about the characters uh okay so gets"
2136480,2143360," so you can just say you can just leave it as it is all right so that should work actually that should"
2143360,2152800," already work uh okay and i wonder um if now i just call this and i think init window uh 800 by 600 and"
2152800,2164640," hello from c3 will that just work okay so it doesn't work so what does it say um okay there is unexpectedly a type"
2164640,2169600," but after the return type did you mean dot"
2169600,2178640," the case probably has some sort of a meaning"
2178640,2187200," so probably capitalized name are types right remember the method stuff"
2188240,2198720," yeah so capitalized identity yeah brother ooh brother uh okay so types let's read about the types"
2198720,2203600," as usual types are divided into basic types and user defined apps blah blah blah all types are defined"
2203600,2208640," the global level naming all user defined types and c3 starts with the uppercase"
2213280,2216320," go things yeah"
2216320,2228720," how you how do you plan to kill c with this kind of stuff how do you plan to kill c but i mean it's fine"
2228720,2236560," it's fine we can live with that so i suppose what that means that means we have to there should be syntax that"
2236560,2242160," allows us to specify the name of the symbol we're linking with there should be some sort of a syntax"
2242160,2253120," uh so let me see let me see let me see let me see so i'm gonna do init window and uh what is that symbol"
2253120,2263360," can i just say symbol uh no so they use add i feel like it's one of these add things right so you see"
2263360,2272880," add if oh oh this is a conditional compilation guys this is a conditional compilation so you"
2273920,2281840," create such declaration if it's not win32 so if you think it's external window right so you you think"
2281840,2287200," it's external window but you did you did you guess that or do you know that that's that's a real question"
2287200,2296320," so extern uh oh you you found that okay so fair enough fair enough so we can actually do it like this"
2297120,2305120," uh init window all right all right all right all right so you were right uh okay so there's no such"
2305120,2312240," thing as const fair enough let's get rid of that and we successfully compiled we successfully compile"
2312240,2321200," and if i take a look at ldd we actually link with raylib.so but i don't want to like you know mess"
2321200,2326000," with like our paths or anything like that so i'm going to actually statically link with this entire thing"
2326000,2332160," i'm going to be statically linking with this entire thing and so the size of the executable is now 1.6"
2332160,2342240," megabyte before it was below megabyte right so if i try to run hello we just speed round ray deep easy peasy"
2342240,2354400," that's a huge plus to language uh that it doesn't stay on my way too much in linking with c"
2355200,2362320," as i said in my ada video right so if like any self-respective language should not stay on your way"
2362320,2368960," uh to link c libraries because that's where the useful code is right so it's pretty cool that you're"
2368960,2374560," trying to kill this unsafe language and stuff like that but a lot of useful code is written in c so if i"
2374560,2380320," need to link with c please don't stay in my way doing that and i appreciate that so it's already serious"
2380320,2385440," language this language this language takes itself seriously uh right so i can write some stuff in"
2385440,2393760," it so that's actually pretty cool um that's pretty cool so when i can just like continue doing this"
2393760,2399760," entire process right so continue doing this entire process add uh more and more bindings and maybe write"
2399760,2404560," some sort of a game right so i can now close the window right so close window doesn't really accept"
2404560,2414400," anything in here uh right so let's just say close window close window uh okay so let's try to compile"
2414400,2425440," this nothing but seems to be compiled cool uh and um so we can now do the other thing so lip c do we have"
2425440,2436480," booleans anywhere so there's just a boolean um yeah i suppose i can probably do extern fn bool um window"
2436480,2451600," should close and this is going to be um extern uh extern window should close and the last things i want to"
2451600,2459280," define in here is probably begin drawing begin drawing and end drawing so begin drawing and end drawing"
2459280,2468960," all right so then i can define something like this uh not window should close right while window should"
2468960,2476960," not close we're gonna begin drawing and end drawing so it's very important to organize an event loop and"
2476960,2484480," call this begin drawing and end drawing functions because they contain uh you know draining the event"
2484480,2490960," queue and also synchronizing the frames and also swapping the buffers right so you really want to call"
2490960,2497040," them on each individual uh iteration otherwise the event loop is not going to work properly um"
2497040,2504560," so finding i already became his quintessential test bench for new language this is because i'm not really"
2504560,2510320," creative like what else can i do right so okay i'm presented with the language so how am i going to"
2510320,2515680," test it i'm i'm going to test it on things that i usually do all right so i usually use ray leap to"
2515680,2520160," draw things like can i do ray leap in this language i can't do radio in this language useless"
2520160,2526400," fucking use all right so a defer by the way this is a cool idea let's do defer"
2527520,2536640," yo look at that shise the minor friday can your c do that can your stupid c do that i don't fucking"
2536640,2547840," think so uh right so and the cool thing about ray dip is that it works with any language right so that's"
2547840,2555040," the power of simple languages like c that's the power of simple languages like c right so you can write"
2555040,2560800," some code and it will work in any language like we haven't not encounter encountered a language yet"
2560800,2567840," that would not support ray leap in one way or another uh because it's just a c code you can link"
2567840,2574720," with c code with in pretty much any language so uh anyways let's try to compile this and this"
2574720,2580480," is going to compile i think it is going to compile look at that and if i do hello look at that we've got"
2580480,2586160," hello from c window we'll get a window we'll already create the window"
2586160,2596560," and the window was closed successfully window was closed successfully because it called close window"
2596560,2601440," if i remove this thing will it say close a window was closed successfully that's a very interesting"
2601440,2608320," question actually i'm really curious uh all right it didn't print window was closed successfully"
2608320,2614560," it didn't print that so if i put defer in here and i just run it right so it will create a window i"
2614560,2622640," close the window it says window was closed successfully defer actually worked defer actually look at that"
2622640,2629200," that's super cool isn't it i think it's pretty cool uh all right so"
2631120,2640240," you can do ray leap in you know in this thing that's pretty cool but lately um lately defer and"
2640240,2650800," the only reason to do defer and drawing is so i can actually do the actual drawing somewhere here"
2650800,2657120," like after like no it's kind of it's kind of too much honestly like you guys it's too much i can understand"
2657120,2664560," that for close window but within the you know event loop it's it's it's it's too it's too much because"
2664560,2670160," this is supposed to be like a like a block uh you're supposed to treat it as like a block where you start"
2670160,2677840," drawing and then end drawing and so on and so forth right so i think deferring here is a little bit of overkill"
2678480,2686240," um yeah that's pretty cool language pretty cool language but lately lately i've been working with"
2686240,2694320," uh web a lot i basically became a web developer right i lived long enough to see myself becoming a villain"
2694320,2702560," right so the question is can i use this thing in in web can i compile this mother flipper to"
2704000,2714720," wasm module let's say does it have a wasm support of some sort i wonder uh right so let's actually do"
2714720,2722320," c3c and does it mention wasm okay so it doesn't mention wasm anywhere in here disappointed but maybe"
2722320,2729200," it mentions something about the target uh so build target is a current now i don't mean this kind of target"
2729200,2730880," i mean the compilation target"
2730880,2748080," okay so uh let's say web c3 and for instance i want to create like an external function um that"
2748080,2754880," computes a sum right so let's actually say uh it's going to be a so it it has a list targets okay so"
2754880,2759520," we'll we'll call it uh but let me finish it first let me finish this thing first so i'm going to do"
2759520,2764720," something like this uh right so list targets can you"
2775360,2776320," fucking bingo"
2776320,2784160," motherfucking bingo okay so can i all right all right so to compile"
2784160,2795120," uh targets um wasm 32 and let's say web assuming non-postex environment no main function was fun"
2795120,2800240," compilation all the object files are generated i hope it's not going to speed out well okay"
2804240,2818400," um so yeah it barfed again it really barfed again uh so it says something like assuming non-postex"
2818400,2823120," environment no main function was final compilation on the object files are generated so i feel like i have"
2823120,2830160," to explicitly say that i'm compiling like a module or something like that c3 bombed again"
2832080,2845600," yeah c3 bom uh c3 bom uh okay so let me let me see if what we can do in here no entry do not generate"
2845600,2851840," uh a main function so we can try to do that we can say okay no entry"
2854800,2859120," linking is okay linking is not supported for unknown os okay that's fine"
2859120,2869680," look i would like it to just generate like a static wasm module but i feel like it's not gonna easily do"
2869680,2876080," that um right so maybe it maps main to web assembly entry point but web assembly doesn't have an entry"
2876080,2884240," point that's the thing by itself unless it's uh some sort of a stand that maybe wise it has something"
2884240,2890400," statically okay so let me actually see what uh statically has has to do in here so static"
2890400,2899040," lib maybe the word static so doesn't really okay statically compile files without a project into"
2899040,2907520," a static library okay all right all right static lib maybe in this case i don't have to do that"
2910480,2922640," okay okay and it's just an archive it didn't give us anything per se i wouldn't say so it doesn't look"
2922640,2931120," like awesome either doesn't look like awesome either wasn't i mean all right so let's take a look at other"
2931120,2938640," uh commands in here uh commands in here dynamic clip compile run compile only"
2938640,2949040," all right so output okay so let's give it a try so there was an output uh let me find output"
2950000,2955600," uh there's oh there's there's only output here but maybe i have to do something like help"
2955600,2961920," output no i don't see an output"
2961920,2970080," uh all right so maybe there is something related to wasm in the documentation i specifically didn't want to"
2970080,2975600," use um you know to use um you know documentation because i wanted to figure it out uh figure that out"
2975600,2980720," myself web assembly uh dynamic leap yeah"
2983600,2985360," they have they have o okay"
2985360,2997360," right so let's try um static clip and let's say the o is going to be web wasm"
2997360,3000880," assuming web"
3000880,3012320," uh at wasm uh so why do you say at wasm that doesn't tell me anything honestly that doesn't tell me"
3012320,3021280," anything all right so do we have anything in lib std lib or anything like that so i feel like what i"
3021280,3026960," need in here is just an example that's just an example so maybe we can find some example in the"
3026960,3035360," official source code uh org it wasn't a yeah that's funny actually that is rather funny not gonna lie"
3035360,3041920," that is rather funny um so unfortunately just like with anything in web"
3042480,3048080," it is not obvious how to do that uh right so it is not obvious how to do that uh right so it is not"
3048080,3053520," obvious how to do that so maybe there are some tests uh so there's src"
3056240,3063600," a simple example a simple example uh as um ever support matrix"
3063600,3068880," support matrix"
3068880,3076560," okay so wasm so what is this native c3 compiler available"
3078880,3091520," no but what is that target supported yes uh wasm and i don't really mention wasm that much and"
3091520,3100160," just wasm in the documentation in here okay there is a wasm keyword i remember somebody in the chat"
3100160,3107440," talking about the wasm keyword but again just how do i use that how do i use it i don't know there is a"
3107440,3115040," keyword for this thing but there is no example how to use that so i don't know i don't know i don't know"
3116160,3121280," so uh i'm clicking on search it doesn't it doesn't allow me to search again"
3121280,3129680," he passed documentation i have a feeling that wasm support is just generally"
3129680,3136560," not ready right so it's it's there to some extent like uh dude can you just work"
3138080,3146320," uh it's having the trouble to to do anything all right so yeah it's it's kind of there but it feels"
3146320,3148320," like a little bit experimental um"
3148320,3159680," you use it like extern but how do i compile it that's the thing okay so cool i can do wasm but how"
3159680,3167360," then i compile my thing how then i compile it i don't know um right so what i need"
3167360,3176080," is just an example uh right file wasm file and the command line that compiles it to wasm module"
3176080,3181120," as soon as i get it was a module i can figure out what to do with it right so okay there is a wasm"
3181120,3188320," keyword but so what so what i can use it at next turn give me command line uh so"
3188320,3193200," see what i'm talking about it's not helpful it's not helpful chat stop being unhelpful"
3197280,3204560," so yeah there's some stuff in here uh there's some yeah i suppose it's incomplete so there wasn't"
3204560,3211120," initialized uh yeah i couldn't figure out how to use that i just straight up couldn't figure out"
3211120,3218720," so i can do compile uh i can try to do something like this by the way maybe if i"
3221360,3226960," um so this is c3 let me try to compile one more time so no main function was fine compilation let's"
3226960,3231280," give it a main function right so if it wants to have a main function let's just give it a main function"
3231280,3234640," right so here is your main function"
3234640,3243760," and link is not supported for unknown os um so maybe we have to specify the os then uh maybe we have to"
3243760,3252560," specify the os let me see or as well it's not it's not the os i want um support for particular architecture"
3252560,3254160," plus os target"
3257200,3267280," okay how do i specify os then um perhaps unknown unknown yeah probably um known unknown but they said"
3267280,3277840," that uh probably just unknown yeah couldn't figure out i literally couldn't figure out i tried"
3277840,3285920," i genuinely tried i'm gonna assume that wasm support is just like not ready so it's just like not ready"
3285920,3292960," so we're gonna put it aside we're not gonna try to do that uh right so yeah i'm already streaming for"
3292960,3298560," one hour and i would like to maybe make a small break uh refill my water and stuff like that and then"
3298560,3304560," after the break we're gonna try to maybe write something game of life well at least we can link with"
3304560,3310880," rave leap which is already something uh right so yeah we'll try to figure out what we can do so anyway"
3310880,3316800," um all right i'm back so let's actually clean up after the compiler right so we have no idea what the"
3316800,3324240," fuck is all that uh right so but let's just remove the object files and also remove all of that stuff"
3324240,3332320," so what we're gonna do boys and girls what we're gonna do so um let's try to clean maybe"
3332320,3342640," the background first of all right so we're gonna do clear background uh and so get back ground clear"
3342640,3353280," background and uh so as a color by the way right so since it has a such a great uh interrupt with c so"
3353280,3359600," that means you should be able to define color as a structure right if i take a look at the red leap so"
3360240,3366000," clear clear background right so it is a color and we can take a look at the type dev strike well"
3366000,3374960," i mean i could just do cola right how can i define this kind of structure also with an intent to do"
3374960,3385600," interrupt uh with c so do you have a struct okay so this is kind of stuff we can do uh i wonder if there's a c"
3386160,3400880," u int uh you int uh u int c u char i don't see c u char so there is a usz which is i suppose u size um"
3400880,3414000," but i don't see u char maybe it's just char it could be just char um so let me open the documentation for c3 i"
3414000,3419520," already kind of closed the uh the website so let me open it again"
3419520,3427200," uh does it have a section for f c interoperability right i should have actually looked into this thing"
3427200,3435360," first um okay so there is a extern uh linking static dynamic libraries and that's about it right so we"
3435360,3442000," we don't really have that much stuff c3 you cannot use c bit fields we don't really need c bit fields"
3442000,3448240," uh fixed integer size that means int and c int does not need to be this does not need to be the same"
3448240,3458160," uses fixed integer sizes uh okay i don't really know what that means so that means i can specify the size of"
3458160,3466080," this of this of the integer if i use it i'm really sure what that means right so but that's fine um so"
3466080,3471280," this is a struct so this is a div result uh and"
3473680,3485840," do you have like a div function in c library what is div i never heard of such c function"
3490400,3495120," way the freaking there leap c has fractions"
3495120,3510240," i just learned something about just lip c not c3 or anything like that slip c has fractions did you guys"
3510240,3519200," know that computes the value of returns"
3519200,3530000," holy i didn't know that i just learned that through exploring c3 and just like"
3530000,3539040," what the fuck what the fuck uh anyways anyways anyways anyways so here is we do div time i suppose time t"
3539040,3546160," is it's not really a structure unfortunately um so there is a c file but i suppose c file is an opaque"
3546160,3556560," type yeah it is an opaque type um i feel like i can just pass structures in there right anyways um i suppose"
3556560,3563600," what i want to do i want to just do struct color uh and if i take a look at the structs in here so i suppose"
3563600,3579440," it's going to be char r uh g b a and i wonder in terms of the structures um so struct"
3579440,3587920," uh-huh so i don't see structure so maybe it's something with the types can i have structure literals"
3589040,3595280," can i have structure literals uh i'm not quite sure so maybe there was something in examples yeah"
3595280,3604480," so struct okay so i have struct types um and i can have nice districts and stuff like that but it doesn't"
3604480,3606560," it doesn't really tell me that much"
3606560,3617920," um so i have to see i had to ask in the desk discord uh you can there aren't is okay so that's actually"
3617920,3623600," pretty cool all right all right all right so that means i can do clear background and i can just do"
3623600,3635040," something like r 255 and i feel like it may not work exactly the way i expect it to work right so because"
3635040,3642240," um the characters are signed so i'm not sure if it's going to even compile properly"
3642240,3645360," um so this is not what i wanted i wanted to actually do"
3646400,3653840," um array leap where is the array leap yeah here it is so let's just do the really okay so that work"
3653840,3662080," that work exactly as i expected okay so it's pretty cool um so we can okay so that was easy"
3662080,3663360," that was easier than i expected"
3663360,3671600," all right so how about uh hexadecimal literals so can i do something like this"
3672400,3679680," uh okay something like this so i can just do something like uh ff all right so and the"
3679680,3686480," background should be yeah so it's the same background as my editor uh 18 18 18 in in hex"
3686480,3692480," so but as far as i know in ray leap uh you have a special function get color that allows you to"
3692480,3701520," just do that so i could do something like uh get color all right so 80 80 80 ff"
3702080,3709120," this is the kind of stuff i can do in here um so but color is unsigned integer which makes me wonder"
3709120,3716400," so this one returns a cola by the way so i can just return the color but it accepts"
3716400,3725360," c in does it have cu it does in fact have cu in so it's it's called uh hex value so and then we can say"
3726400,3734640," extern extern extern uh get color so we can do stuff like that all right so we're gonna compile"
3734640,3739760," i'm gonna work are you gonna twerk it is working it is a fucking twerking mate all right so we need"
3739760,3747600," to draw something on the screen right so we need to draw the rectangle um so draw a rectangle so we need"
3747600,3757760," this thing so we'll just grab it let's just grip it just grip it external i'm so sorry uh right so c"
3757760,3770640," int and yeah that's about it so we can do draw rectangle so writing bindings for this language is"
3770640,3776560," easier because it's easier because it's almost c so you can just copy paste c declarations and just like"
3776560,3784880," you know uh tweak it a little bit and it's basically c3 basically c3 so uh external external"
3786480,3791920," so draw rectangle so draw rectangle so we're going to draw rectangle and let's just draw it so let's"
3791920,3799680," just fucking draw it mate draw rectangle uh so position is going to be 0 0 width and height let's say"
3799680,3806960," maybe it's going to be 100 by 100 and the color is going to be maybe red let's use get color to uh you"
3806960,3815360," know figure it out all right so let's go uh so is it going to work look at that look at that isn't that"
3815360,3821360," poggers isn't that workers so and to be fair like i want you to do game of life but i don't think game"
3821360,3826640," of life does the justice of this language one of the things i want you to test for this language specifically"
3826640,3834480," is the vectors so let's do something physics related right so where we need like a position vector and"
3834480,3840720," velocity vector and we can update it over time and stuff like that uh is it just here well i mean it"
3840720,3848480," obviously fail falls into the same niches here um right whether it's you know the same as here"
3848480,3853280," right i don't really know i think it's slightly different semantically and obviously syntactically"
3853280,3861520," so one of the advantage of this language i see is that some of the algorithms from c can be directly"
3861520,3867760," copy pasted in here and just like used without modifications which is cool all right so this is"
3867760,3875200," one of the advantages that c++ has right and one of the reasons why c++ became popular uh right so"
3875200,3882800," you can just like you have c code base you have c code base and you can just use c++ compiler for"
3882800,3890160," the c code base so and basically zig is trying to repeat this kind of success right but in a more"
3890160,3899760," annoying way um so yeah anyway um we have that so let's actually take a look at the vectors uh right"
3899760,3908480," how do you do vector types um i suppose yeah so we can just basically define a position so let's go ahead"
3908480,3914400," and define position so this is going to be something like this so this is uh the position right so this is"
3914400,3922000," basically the position and uh it's going to be zero zero can you actually spread that thing somehow"
3922000,3929360," you know what i mean you know what i mean oh this is basically our case look at that"
3929360,3938400," huh look at that look at that look but i'm not sure if it's if you can just like literally do that"
3940000,3946320," no i'm not gonna use it like that so essentially it will be kind of cool if i could take the position"
3946320,3949200," right so take the position and just like sort of spread it like this"
3949200,3955040," uh so yeah and by the way it has to be flow thank you thank you so much"
3955040,3962480," all right so let me see yeah it's like javascript damaged my brain i'm sorry so i suppose i can do"
3962480,3968880," things like this uh is it going to work uh it's not going to work look at that so how do i access the"
3968880,3977600," elements from this thing uh so this is the flows how a float okay float cannot be implicitly converted"
3977600,3985440," you must use cast how do you cast things in c3 do we have any professional three c3 developers in the chat"
3985440,3991440," who develops in this language professionally how do you do casts uh we can actually search let's do cast"
3992480,4002640," uh integer to point a cast uh yeah so let's just actually see is it like in in c um yeah it's"
4002640,4008080," probably like in c because it tries to mimic c so let's let's give it a try i'm going to explicitly say"
4008080,4016720," c int and this is one i'm going to be c int let's go all right this isn't going to compile it seems to be"
4016720,4026160," yo look at that okay so what i want to do i want to do float do uh velocity or velocity and i'm going to"
4026160,4032800," just do 100 by 100 right and now before rendering this entire thing i want to do"
4032800,4044960," equals position plus velocity multiplied by delta time and delta time is going to be uh basically get"
4046720,4052720," frame time yeah frame time get frame time so is it how it's called in really but i don't quite remember"
4052720,4061600," get frame yeah it is it is basically that all right so let's put it in here so it's going to be external"
4061600,4069440," function get frame time uh i don't think i need that and then i'm going to grab this entire thing"
4070080,4089200," get frame time all right all right that is very cool feature i really like this vector stuff"
4089200,4098240," i really fucking love this vector stuff i wonder by the way my friend if i can use the version the"
4098240,4105280," advanced version of the draw rectangle from ray v uh draw rectangle something like a v which accepts"
4105280,4114800," the vector 2 and i wonder if uh the vectors of c3 are compatible with vector 2 in here so because"
4114800,4119280," vector 3 vector 2 in here is just a structure so i think it's defined somewhere in ray math"
4119280,4125520," uh is that language yeah it is a language feature right so it has a built-in vector types"
4126240,4132480," um so on which you can do mathematical operations right so you just define this kind of thing and"
4132480,4136800," you do multiplication and it just does component wise multiplication automatically you don't have"
4136800,4141680," to overload operators or anything like that it's just like it's it's a feature of the language right"
4141680,4147440," so this is by the way one of the like probably primary thing that prompted me to at some point look"
4147440,4153280," into this language because this is something that i wanted uh in uh in a native language like on the level of"
4153280,4159600," c and it implements a couple of like a g uh glsl things like swizzling for instance you can do this"
4159600,4163920," kind of shit automatically you don't have to define anything or anything it's just like straight"
4163920,4167440," up swizzling from glsl so this is pretty cool"
4167440,4173360," how did you discover this language anyway i think somebody posted it on discord"
4174240,4180880," and i just looked briefly into this thing and i just like what the i really like this thing um"
4180880,4186160," is there a sprb compile target that's a good question let me see um"
4186160,4190960," so let's do these targets"
4191920,4200240," uh nah there's no spirit that'll be actually kind of cool so there's net psd well i mean it's llvm"
4200240,4206880," right so it supports everything a little vm supports right basically um right to some extent"
4206880,4217040," okay so what do we have in here oh i have okay so let me let me see um so i wanted to use a more"
4217040,4221840," advanced version of draw rectangle that's what i wanted to do more advanced thing because i feel"
4221840,4231840," like you should be able to just do that uh so extern fn and in here what i can do can i just do float"
4231840,4242400," to uh float yeah flow to essentially um and if it's going to work at some point maybe i can use scholar as"
4242400,4249520," a vector which is going to be way cooler honestly uh all right so this is a draw vector v"
4249520,4258960," draw rectangle v i'm sorry i'm already a little bit tired extern draw vector rectangle v"
4258960,4270160," there we go so and that will enable me to just pass this position without any casting or anything like"
4270160,4276960," that so in here i would have to do something like 100 100 and here is the get code if this will work"
4276960,4283040," that would be absolutely freaking poppers okay it doesn't really work that name it was expected but"
4283040,4290640," given the variable something something something i don't get it what do you want from i forgot to put a"
4290640,4300000," void in here that's understandable is it going to work dude no way you so that means i can actually use"
4300160,4305760," i can just say this kind of i can just like use vectors all the way through"
4305760,4313520," okay so i can just use the vectors right so that means i can do ff well i mean it's not particularly"
4313520,4316960," convenient but i mean i can i can just use vectors"
4319840,4326400," well i can say that get caller returns a vector right so i can probably okay i can probably define"
4326400,4334320," caller to be uh like a vector character four or something like that at some point not right now but"
4334320,4342640," i mean at some point i will be able to do that so i can finally change all of these small structures into"
4342640,4348640," vectors on which i can do sort of like array operations um so"
4348640,4352320," okay"
4352320,4357440," so that means in here"
4357440,4362720," i can just swap them around and this thing is going to be green"
4365040,4372480," okay that's cool so and honestly uh what i can do right as i already said i can just say color right"
4372480,4379840," you can just say code and replace this thing with that is going to come back ah yes okay that's fine"
4379840,4388720," okay so you know what else can i can do i can do vector two and this is going to be float two so i can"
4388720,4396400," just have aliases for all of these things uh all right so this is going to be vector two this one is"
4396400,4397040," going to be"
4397040,4406240," vector two so it looks a little bit closer to raylib code but it uses nice stuff from c3"
4409600,4418160," okay i can work with that cool very very cool um so"
4418160,4424880," versions two did i say version now it's a vector two all right what else can we do in here what else can"
4424880,4425440," we do in here"
4425440,4435920," we can maybe um i don't know add a little bit of the let's just make it bounce around basically right so"
4435920,4443600," the usual thing so maybe we can make it start from i don't know from like a little bit away from the wall"
4443600,4450720," all right and by the way if i remember correctly you can actually compile and run simultaneously"
4450720,4460960," yeah so here is the compile and run so i can don't have to run it like this i can just run it like this"
4460960,4471600," compile and run okay that's cool uh so now if i want to make it bounce around this stuff"
4471600,4480480," the way i usually do that is i update the components separately so in here it may become a little bit of an"
4480480,4485520," mass to do um but that's probably fine"
4485520,4498000," uh that's probably fine so let's maybe make it a little bit faster first of all so in here we're"
4498000,4507920," gonna have a float new x which is position x plus velocity x multiplied by dt right so you can just do that"
4507920,4515440," for the vectors uh and as far as i know you can even use r and r is an alias for x and i suppose maybe"
4515440,4519920," you can also access the binders but i'm not sure about that so don't quote me on that but you can do"
4519920,4525760," that since you can do swizzling right so that means you you should be able to do this kind of thing uh"
4525760,4537280," right so this is an x and if uh nx right so we need to be aware of the size of the player how do you define constants"
4537280,4543280," how do you define constants right so there was a depth right so"
4545120,4554480," def so define def statements in three is intended for aliasing identifiers and the types it's kind of"
4554480,4564400," interesting so i suppose it acts like um hash define in c but actually normal if you know what i mean like"
4564400,4568640," actually part of the language not part of some sort of like weird preprocessor or anything like that"
4568640,4579520," that uh so you can you know alias names oh there's also distinct types distinct in line"
4579520,4584640," to create generics times functions and variables"
4584640,4594000," it's a kind of weird thing so it's a definition it's a thing for defining aliases"
4595680,4602080," that's what it is or any kind of alias type alias value maybe value alias like name alias and stuff"
4602080,4609280," like that that's what it is so the reason why i'm like focusing on that can i have something like"
4609280,4620080," player size which is basically just uh define uh define player size like this can i have something like"
4620080,4625440," that uh let's let's find out let's actually find out so i'm gonna"
4625680,4631920," just comment it out and i'm gonna try to run it so it didn't like that expected constant name in here"
4631920,4644400," so it doesn't understand the type of this thing uh if i specify the type of this thing as a vector 2"
4644400,4650800," will it well i mean obviously yeah it's not going to work like that because the definition of the types"
4650800,4659280," you define first type and then the name right so first type and then use const um you think const is"
4659280,4666320," going to work uh let's give it a try it's kind of it's kind of weird but i mean"
4666320,4676800," okay const works okay so it's like in c plus plus so you okay let me ask you so you're right now sitting in"
4676800,4682800," there discord and basically asking all of the questions that i have in here so you're basically"
4682800,4684480," translating them my quest"
4684480,4689200," so that was good"
4689200,4692000," um"
4692000,4700720," say hi to them no i'm not it's i think i found myself when doing the the same thing okay okay okay i see"
4700720,4718560," so if this thing is less than zero or an x plus player size x uh is greater than the you know size of"
4718560,4726480," the window we can do like get screen widths we can do get screen width in that case what we want to do we"
4726480,4734880," want to do velocity x multiplied by minus one uh right otherwise otherwise otherwise we are committing"
4734880,4748160," that new x and then i'm going to replace um x with y boom but i have to replace this thing so"
4749440,4762560," yeah um get screen if i remember correctly get screen widths returns an integer yeah it's an integer it's a c"
4762560,4777440," integer c int get screen widths get screen widths boom could replace widths with height boom we are gucci we are"
4777440,4780320," we are gucci we are tamaguchi let's go"
4780320,4792640," bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow easy all right so pretty cool uh and uh so the next"
4792640,4800640," thing i want to probably introduce in here is the gravity right so that means i can do vector two gravity"
4800640,4808240," and since it points down so that means x is going to be zero and in terms of down it is going to be"
4808240,4818560," uh usually like one thousand works fine for me um so usually it works fine so first thing we need"
4818560,4826160," to do we need to modify the velocity so velocity is going to be i suppose plus gravity multiplied by dt"
4826160,4836800," the fact that you just have built-in vectors is so goddamn satisfying um so goddamn satisfying make it"
4836800,4845680," change the color enclosure that sounds like like an interesting idea looking so yeah it doesn't lose any"
4845680,4853680," energy right doesn't lose any energy so i think every time it collides with something right so we change the"
4853680,4860720," this thing so we have to do maybe something like this so at some point it will lose enough energy"
4860720,4862720," right"
4862720,4868000," and now it's sliding"
4868000,4874400," so we're changing the color so that means we need to keep track of the color somehow right so this is the"
4874400,4883200," the color and uh the color that i do in here right the color that i do in here it's going to be this"
4883200,4889600," but that raises the question how do we generate the color so i think the easiest thing to do in here"
4889600,4898240," would be to use hsv right so color from hsv so we're going to keep saturation and value the same"
4898240,4903920," but we're going to randomize the hue so we're going to pick a random hue essentially every time we we"
4903920,4910960," collide or something um so first of all let me just pick a random stuff so saturation and value are the"
4910960,4918400," values from zero to one so let's say that it's going to be super saturated and i suppose super bright so the"
4918400,4926080," here is available from 300 360 because it's in degrees i also need to have a random value so does"
4926080,4934960," c3 has a random number generator so let's actually use uh that thing so we can use it from libc honestly"
4936160,4944320," so random oh it has its own random okay so i can appreciate that uh so you can specify the seed"
4944320,4954640," so you accept the random it's kind of a all that is macros look at that we're looking at macros brother"
4954640,4963680," bruv bruv bruv so we can just do rand and okay so that's understandable so you can just do rand and it's a"
4963680,4972240," maximum value okay all right so i think i can work with that chat i think i can work with that so i have"
4972240,4983200," to probably just like import some stuff so std math right import std math it would be also nice to maybe"
4983200,4989920," factor out all of the raylib stuff into a separate thing right so maybe something like raylib c3 but i"
4989920,4994560," don't know how to work with modules uh we have documentation for that so let me see so you can"
4994560,5004240," just do module full all right so i'm gonna just like yolo it um so i created a separate file raylib c3"
5004240,5013680," i suppose i have to put module raylib in here right i'm gonna just try to maybe move all of this raylib related"
5013680,5018800," stuff into that thing all right so i'm gonna just try to do it like that and then i'm gonna"
5018800,5026080," just import raylib and i'm gonna hold that maybe that's enough right so i'm gonna hold that that's"
5026080,5031600," enough so maybe i have to also specify that some of these things look at that i never have to even"
5031600,5038880," specify that those things are public or private or anything like that i really like that um also like"
5038880,5046080," honestly there's some annoying aspect of rust and other kind of similar languages is that"
5046080,5054960," by default they make all of the names within the module private so it is very un ergonomic and i'm"
5054960,5061360," going to explain you why essentially you are writing some code you're just like streaming your consciousness"
5061360,5068320," into the code and you write like a huge blob of code okay so now you want to split that code into"
5068320,5074960," separate modules you take chunks of this code put into separate modules but now these modules are so"
5074960,5079920," interconnected now you have to spend extra time putting publics in all of these things and stuff"
5079920,5085360," like it it's so goddamn fucking annoying so i feel like modules by default has to be always public"
5086000,5091200," right so i already had that about name too very annoying yeah so it's either they have to be all"
5091200,5101040," public or they have to do the jai approach in jai you i think you have like a scope file or something"
5101040,5108560," like that so let me actually find the giant um right right right all right so i think we can open just a"
5108560,5117840," random module and find yeah they have this kind of thing so essentially everything above the scope file"
5117840,5125280," is public everything below is private that's it it's that's it seriously it's the simple delimiter"
5125280,5132080," so essentially if you don't have a scope file right uh it's going to be all public but then you can add"
5132080,5137600," this delimiter and then you can like selectively pick okay make that private that private and that private"
5137600,5143120," and it's almost like mechanical it's almost like mechanical and it's really convenient it's similar"
5143120,5149040," to c plus plus like private public and uh and stuff like that yeah so i really like this approach like"
5149040,5155920," it's it's very ergonomic honestly uh right so you're just like you you know tucking it behind like private"
5155920,5175200," so this is a much better approach uh now uh what we were doing so this is a raylib and uh usu usu usu usu"
5175200,5184240," okay so and now if i try to build is it going to just work okay so it doesn't like uh hsv all right so"
5185760,5193760," so for now i'm going to put it like that and uh i'm going to just say ff 000 ff"
5193760,5200000," all right this is going to compile okay so what do we have in here uh raylib could not be found"
5200000,5207360," that is concerning honestly that is concerning i wonder if i can say okay search for libraries like in here"
5209360,5218080," uh so and this is something that is extremely annoying you have a module raylib in the same"
5218080,5222640," folder as the other module and it doesn't see that so"
5225040,5231600," so add to the compilation command that's a good point so maybe that's exactly what i have to do so"
5231600,5241600," just a second c3 and okay so that worked that actually worked uh but now oh it wants me to have"
5241600,5249680," like a prefixes for raylib interesting can i say import everything can i do stuff like that so"
5249680,5261520," uh by regular level case can i just do all right so here's the modules how can i import implicit"
5261520,5263840," import the module but also"
5263840,5274000," implicit change in default visibility oh this is actually kind of cool so i remember somebody asked"
5274000,5279760," in the chat like isn't it annoying to do private all the time in here uh you can change the default"
5279760,5283840," visibility so you can just do this kind of stuff and they're private by default"
5283840,5292000," all the strokes for all the folks right so if you're if you're the rust guy or girl who likes the"
5292000,5295040," private by default there you go here's your thing"
5295040,5303040," it's pretty cool it's pretty cool so how do i import everything from a brochure"
5304720,5308080," uh so import uh okay"
5308080,5313680," okay importing modules"
5313680,5317440," module sum"
5317440,5329760," so it always feels like maybe i just need to read that always request for import sub modules any"
5329760,5332800," module will automatically import all the other sub modules"
5333680,5334480," uh huh"
5334480,5343200," so import some some full not needed as it is sub module of some"
5343200,5346560," i don't get it"
5346560,5358640," i don't get it are you telling me that i must use really prefix everywhere in here now"
5361520,5366880," that's what you're telling me brother that is kind of annoying so"
5366880,5379280," let me take a look at some of the examples maybe in here i want to just grab for different kinds of"
5379280,5382080," imports how do you import shits"
5384560,5394080," i honestly don't see any special syntax to import everything so and then lipc yeah so the importing"
5394080,5402640," lipc and then the explicitly use i feel like this is a thing in the language right so you have to like prefix this"
5402640,5413360," so i wonder if there's something using namespace yeah exactly i wonder if there's something like using"
5413360,5419840," um let me see maybe there's something because that's a little bit annoying uh using"
5422080,5428880," implicit imports visibility"
5428880,5433040," does uh yeah i already works uh tried star i already tried star"
5436240,5440640," so there's so there is a section in the docs using functions and types from other modules"
5440640,5444480," using functions"
5448160,5452880," and see there is a section using function oh yeah that's what you're saying"
5452880,5457200," uh function from other modules"
5457200,5461760," and it's not obvious"
5461760,5469520," namespace required to avoid them because we always pick the current module name namespace required"
5471680,5478640," series it feels like they require you to do that uh as a rule as a rule functions macros constants"
5478640,5484560," variables and types in the same modules do not uh need any namespace prefix for imported modules the"
5484560,5490720," forms will hold functions macros constant the variables require at least the sub module name"
5495760,5501680," uh"
5501680,5508240," sad sad sad uh use built in"
5508240,5518800," way i saw this thing i saw this thing in the in the standard library just a second"
5518800,5523280," built in"
5525760,5529680," um"
5529680,5533200," what does built-in do do do they even explain"
5533200,5537520," built-ins"
5537520,5544320," have all of us built-in constants and all available in a certain targets"
5544320,5545680," so"
5545680,5552720," i don't think it's a good idea right so i suppose there is a special exception for things that are sort of built"
5552720,5558640," in um so now i'm not going to do that right so it's an interesting idea but i'm not going to do that"
5558640,5566080," all right apparently it is a rule uh we have to literally prefix it can i at least like rename it"
5566080,5571200," as no no i can't do that because it's a little bit annoying i would like to maybe rename it"
5572480,5577600," um right um right okay so this is going to be a ray leap"
5577600,5579840," uh ray leap"
5579840,5584400," ray leap okay okay okay okay okay"
5584400,5586400," uh ray"
5586400,5594480," ray leap but at least now ray leap is not going to collide with win api or anything like that"
5594480,5596960," because that was the major problem with ray you can see"
5598400,5605520," uh that was the major problem with ray leap in c okay so i didn't finish all these things so window"
5605520,5607280," should close"
5607280,5612160," okay so get screen"
5612160,5616720," get screen"
5619840,5627920," all right so a get color yeah get color is annoying but yeah it's not that annoying"
5627920,5633120," all right so pretty cool"
5633120,5643440," uh and it kind of kind of stuck um so what we want you to do we want you to have color from hsv"
5645120,5652080," so here's the color from hsv and in the red lib in here and already been here i'm going to"
5652080,5660000," uh just find it right so color from hsv so there is a c do i have to do c float i'm"
5660000,5668560," yeah so here i just use float and it was totally fine so maybe in libc can it have floats yeah so you"
5668560,5678800," can just use floats uh extern fn and it's supposed to return just a caller and this is just an external"
5678800,5698080," thing um color from hsv core from hsv so now in hello uh i just do ray leap um color from hsv"
5698560,5706480," right that's what i do uh and i need the random stuff so math random math random so i need to"
5706480,5713280," import actually something like this i need math random and the function that i want to do"
5713280,5722480," what i use actually is rather interesting um so it's um random"
5723440,5731840," rand i suppose there was just rand yeah there we go so it takes a maximum so that means i can do the"
5731840,5738400," following thing right uh i can just say the maximum is going to be 100 and then i can divide"
5738400,5747600," by 100 so this is how i can can get the value from 0 to 1. maybe there is a way to use okay so"
5751360,5758800," next float you have to provide the random in here so that means you need to construct the random um"
5758800,5769840," so the macro random is there just like a default random so there is an interface random um"
5769840,5779280," so we provide the seed so they all accept some sort of a random but they have no idea how to construct this"
5779280,5789360," thing oh this is built in this is built in so that means i don't have to prefix this entire thing because"
5789360,5796080," it uses the cheating right it uses the cheating okay so let's just try to compile it i don't want to run"
5796080,5802400," it right away it compiles right so just like so this is what you you guys were talking about right so you"
5802400,5806320," you put built in here and you don't have to put built in here and you don't have to this is so bizarre honestly"
5806320,5817040," it it it gives me like a neem vibes neem is actually riddled with these kind of undocumented magical things"
5817040,5822960," uh but this is because it's probably unfinished language right so it's understandable it's totally understandable"
5822960,5832480," um okay anyway so let's just try to run it let's try to run it and see what it's going to do and it crashed"
5832480,5839200," very interesting actually so it's something with the ray leap"
5840400,5847360," um so i accepted the yeah a legal instruction in it holy"
5847360,5851680," hmm"
5851680,5860800," ub yeah so we finally got some ub stuff i wonder okay so what if i just like do it like that uh is it going to"
5863440,5871520," it's because of the random believe it or not it's because of the goddamn random so what if i put this"
5871520,5873840," thing in here um"
5885600,5888560," guys your random implementation using and"
5888560,5900320," not existing instructions maybe random needs a seat maybe um i don't know so seed but i mean"
5900320,5903440," i don't know man"
5903440,5909840," again where do i get this the the random thing"
5912240,5917040," so you know what's cool about ray dip is that it has its own random um"
5917040,5925360," uh yep it just has its own random like"
5925360,5930960," you didn't have to rely on vendors of the languages or anything that i can just use"
5930960,5936720," yep um i don't know what exactly incorrectly i did in here but i mean"
5939440,5946560," this is what it is and it isn't what it isn't get random value and in hello"
5946560,5959840," we can do array leap get random value so from 0 to 100 divided by 100 and we can just try to run it"
5959840,5968320," there we go so it uses the random code and so i suppose i can now inline this whole thing"
5969440,5976880," uh like so so that is going to work uh so some app probably see"
5978320,5987280," use it when it's sliding it's just constantly actually"
5987280,6012400," you know when it's sliding it's just constantly actually uh you know chain colliding basically so yeah"
6013520,6014800," uh"
6014800,6025040," okay so uh maybe we can actually have more of these things uh i can we have more of these things how"
6025040,6031520," you do do you do arrays uh all right so here's the razor can you have dynamic arrays"
6032320,6037920," um so you you just specify array size okay understandable pretty"
6037920,6051440," type inferred ah it's it's just inferred okay so you can have slices can you extend slices uh conversion"
6051440,6060640," list okay understandable internals uh iteration okay well vectors is not what it is not c plus plus vectors"
6060640,6065680," uh iteration uh iteration over arrays so"
6065680,6070560," ooh looks familiar"
6070560,6076640," so you can just push some arrays and then you can"
6076640,6081520," you can then iterate them how for each works in this case"
6083520,6086480," so you may iterate over slices array vectors using for each"
6086480,6091600," it is possible to enable for each for any type by implementing len and"
6091600,6098000," brackets methods and annotating them using the operator attribute"
6100240,6116560," is there any generics right so you have dynamics arrays in here but um yeah"
6118640,6119920," uh so"
6119920,6128960," what is going on why people are pinging me so we need to ban somebody who needs to be banned mods mods"
6130000,6132400," ban radicus and sammy 1g perma ban"
6132400,6142400," so i don't understand who you guys are talking about"
6142400,6147120," uh it's that person okay let's actually ban them i see them"
6147120,6157920," boom okay you're welcome you're welcome so it's actually very convenient when people who needs to be banned"
6157920,6162160," say say say that i need to be banned it's very convenient thank you thank you so much"
6162160,6163520," um"
6163520,6171920," so i'm clicking ban but nothing is happening so you can just uh use the uh the slash ban command"
6171920,6178880," so as far as i know it just works in web chat as well right so just like ban that person or somebody"
6180640,6188320," we won yeah we won um so it would be kind of nice to have some sort of generics or or whatnot but we"
6188320,6194560," can just use static arrays uh right so let's actually define something like n so it's an integer and"
6194560,6201280," let's say we're going to have like a 10 of them but uh so we need to factor out"
6202800,6211600," this uh into a separate structure so let's call it something like object right and it's going to be a"
6211600,6225440," vector position so then velocity velocity and color something like this uh so yeah and uh let's actually do"
6225440,6233600," something like object all right and uh i can probably do something like that uh-huh look at that"
6233600,6246400," so let's try to go to the compilation of all so yeah it's complaining about very much expected stuff so"
6246400,6255760," this is object um all right and then so it's going to be 28 position where is the position i didn't see"
6255760,6264720," position for some reason but it's an object so also object maybe actually what i have to do is query"
6264720,6276160," replace query place position with object position like this like this boom boom boom boom boom boom and by"
6276160,6280480," the way i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure i can just do something something like this"
6280480,6291040," so yeah wait this is not yeah so this is not supposed to be here right so definitely definitely not"
6291040,6302640," supposed to be here so query place velocity with object velocity boom boom no that one that one that one for sure"
6302640,6310160," not that one that one that one that one there we go cool and the same for the course the same for the colors"
6310160,6325360," um so colors uh this is not that this is not that that that that that all right so that's pretty cool"
6326320,6336560," all right look at that look at that isn't it cool i think it's pretty cool okay so one of the things i"
6336560,6347200," want to do is probably um maybe randomize an object right uh object oh i can have methods in here can i"
6348240,6355360," say bravo i can have methods in here"
6355360,6364160," so uh and it's it's like yeah you can you can just do a fan uh object randomizing and yeah"
6364160,6372640," actually it's rather convenient i'm surprised how convenient it is so it's going to be obg so and can move all of that"
6372640,6381680," that shit into randomization of the objects so in terms of i suppose since it's a decent language"
6381680,6389280," right i don't have to do arrows or anything like that i expect it to automatically dereference all of"
6389280,6395120," the structures yeah it is the case right i don't have to do this kind of shit uh right so we can do it like"
6395120,6402160," that and so we can just set a random position uh but the question is like what kind of random position"
6402160,6408560," we're going to be doing in here um so let's say it's going to be get random value from zero to"
6408560,6416960," it has to be get um screen width i suppose right so it has to be something like that get screen width"
6418080,6430800," ray deep uh get random value zero get screen height uh-huh look at that so and in both of the keys it's"
6430800,6438240," also really yeah that's pretty cool so this is semicolon this is semicolon i'm not going to set"
6438240,6445120," random velocity yet uh we're going to set it at some point um so i wonder can i just create an"
6445120,6451200," initialized object and just randomize it later is that something i can do let's find out"
6451200,6460160," i can perfect so that's actually super cool so that means now i can have a bunch of objects right so"
6460160,6470720," for example 10 so and then i can do for each uh so object objects uh let me double check how you do for"
6470720,6478000," each right so you just yeah you specify the type uh can i actually specify that i'm you know referring"
6478000,6484480," them by a reference or by a point i think you should be able to so after that i can say randomize"
6484480,6494640," that is pretty ergonomic not gonna lie i like what i'm seeing i really like what i'm seeing so if i try to"
6495200,6501440," now compile well i mean something didn't work okay so how do you do arrays uh how do you define arrays"
6501440,6512320," yeah so i suppose arrays the size of the array is part of the type understandable um right so"
6512320,6520640," what did the object it's not possible to cast object okay um what else do we have in here"
6521600,6527360," um objects oh yeah so now we have a completely different situation and does it iterate them by"
6527360,6535680," reference so i'm not quite sure um let me take a look at the examples and the examples we had for"
6535680,6544480," each i do remember so for each loop you have index and a value but is it by value i have a strange feeling"
6544480,6552240," that it's literally value and trying to modify this thing is not going to do anything so we'll probably"
6552240,6559920," have to do this variant with the index all right so we have to do this uh variant with the index"
6559920,6567280," so this is the velocity okay so let's do for each object object objects"
6569600,6577440," all right and we just like enclose this entire thing in here all right and let's see if it's going to do"
6577440,6585200," anything like i expect it's not yeah it didn't do right because it's not iterated by reference which"
6585200,6596400," this is bizarre honestly so people say it has to be object but i mean you didn't specify the type you're"
6596400,6602240," giving me incorrect for each for each is supposed to have type in there or is it not i i don't know"
6602240,6608160," that is kind of bizarre so let me let me see so this is something like this"
6608160,6617840," oh okay that is cool thank you so much all right all right i like that so also we probably have to"
6619120,6624080," limit this thing by the size of the player do we have a size of the player yeah so we have size of the"
6624080,6636080," player uh minus player size x and uh minus player size y all right so it doesn't really go outside so"
6636080,6645920," what's up with that uh ah i see so the player size well i mean it's not really in floats"
6646880,6655600," yeah that's a bit annoying so i'm gonna just cast it as like 2c int but it's really wrong uh it's really"
6655600,6672640," really wrong in here um so casting casting 2c int is wrong it would be better to have an rng that generates"
6673680,6683760," floats uh floats uh floats zero to one in the first place so i'm gonna put it as a to do which i will"
6683760,6693120," never probably finish right so but as a note to myself right so this is not what i supposed to do but"
6693120,6699280," it's just like whatever all right so we've got those things and we're moving around as you can see it's pretty"
6699280,6707680," easy to scale the code right so i can now quite easily change the amount of objects what about 20 objects"
6707680,6712240," so now i can have 20 of this object so it's easy to scale"
6712240,6725680," so we can uh factor these things so i can say something like uh collision damp all right and we can maybe make it"
6725680,6735440," equal to one again um so we never lose any energy so they keep bumping like jumping around"
6735440,6740560," never losing energy so that's pretty fun so"
6744160,6755040," um yeah that was really fun so yeah that's a cool language i can see myself using this language"
6755040,6761760," it would be also kind of cool if wasm was easier right so but i suppose they're getting there right"
6761760,6767280," so the language is not finished so the wasm support is kind of mad uh but i expect it to be better in the"
6767280,6776000," future so as for the language itself and generally yeah i i can see myself using it i can see myself"
6776000,6786080," using it 8 out of 10 good language but problem again so yeah uh i guess that's it for today i'm already"
6786080,6791840," falling asleep unfortunately i'm already falling asleep so it's not gonna stream for too long thanks everyone"
6791840,6797280," who's watching right now uh i really appreciate that have a good one and i see you all on the next"
6797280,6803600," recreation programming session with a who a mr azuzin i love you"
