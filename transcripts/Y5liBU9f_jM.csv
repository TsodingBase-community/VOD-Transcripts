0,11360," all right looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to another is there isn't such a"
11360,17520," how about that uh all right so let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially"
17520,25760," start the stream uh red circle this time live on twitch and what are we doing today and on"
26560,32880," twitch today we continue developing breakout clone nji but today specifically i wanted to work on a"
32880,38080," little bit of a particle effect right so we're going to talk about that in a minute so i'm going"
38080,45920," to give the link to the to the stream twitch.tv and i'm going to ping everyone who's interested in"
45920,51920," being pinned my computer is being extremely slow today for whatever reason i don't really know why"
53040,55520," uh let me see let me see"
55520,64000," let me see let me see so yeah there we go"
64000,71600," uh just a second all right so everything's fine with my computer so you can find the source code"
71600,75840," for the game i'm developing here if you are interested right so you can find it here hello"
75840,82080," hello everyone welcome welcome welcome so it's just a simple game to try out jai right so uh i'm using it"
82080,87680," as just basically a playground to learn about language um so let's take a look at how the game"
87680,93840," looks like right now so i probably will actually do tmux and i'm going to do jai break all right"
93840,103360," so op team jipin jilinux and uh we're going to try to build for some i just remember that i made the"
103360,110480," first executable so i can actually build the whole game by just running first and it doesn't work uh probably"
110480,117200," because it just points at the wrong uh at the wrong interpreter all right so let's take a look at this"
117200,124400," stuff gilinux and this is going to be first j right there we go and uh this is how the game looks like right"
124400,130400," so this is how it looks like it's pretty simple game it's just straight up like breakout clone or"
130400,137680," something right so uh on the previous stream to learn about uh metaprogramming we implemented our"
137680,144640," own uh hot config reloading even though like jai standard library if you can call it stand library"
144640,151760," uh has its own thing i still decided to implement the thing myself just to learn more about metaprogramming"
151760,157600," in in this language so and i think it was actually pretty good exercise so let's take a look at this"
157600,164400," thing so we have a couple of parameters like another couple of but quite a few parameters in here right"
164400,173280," so and this is basically a configuration file that is parsed by a special module uh params.j and it can be"
173280,180240," used uh either at compile time to sort of bake the values from the configuration file into the executable or it"
180240,186960," can be used at runtime to hot reload the thing right so just depending on the um on the mode that you"
186960,196560," build um it will basically uh bake the values or it will just hot reload them so if there is if there"
196560,202800," is the debug uh sign in the corner that means we're in debug mode and that means uh we hot reloading the"
202800,209920," values uh which means in turn that i can modify things for example i can take the background color"
209920,215600," and make it a little bit more greenish and reload as you can see i didn't have to restart the game"
215600,220880," uh or i can make it a little bit more greenish uh there we go so i can just like reload the thing"
220880,225920," so of course uh jay has its own thing for that but implemented my own one just to learn things right"
225920,234400," so which is actually pretty cool uh right so and to build the release build sort of speak that bakes the"
234400,242640," thing into the executable oh thank you so much john for uh for the rate 464 raiders i'm not really doing"
242640,248560," anything special so i'm actually gonna disable the followers mode just in case like people who don't"
248560,253280," want to follow me just want to say something uh right i'm not doing anything special i'm just learning"
253280,258880," the language i only recently got into better right i was invited by one of the keys thank you so much for"
258880,267120," inviting me uh and uh yeah so i just like implemented the simple breakout clone and uh yeah it's actually"
267120,271920," i really like the language so i've been having the blast like just using it i think it's it's pretty cool"
272960,283360," um sorry like like it so far so all right let's see let's see uh and the source code you can find"
283360,290480," the source code in here if anyone is interested um so it has its own um hot reloading or configuration"
290480,296720," thingy that doesn't use the thing that comes with jay and it is not because whatever comes with jay is"
296720,301360," bad it's just like i wanted to learn more about meta programming so i implemented my own thing"
301360,307360," and it's kind of it kind of sucks because i don't know much about uh meta programming in jay so i just"
307360,312000," like hacked something together just to get the the idea of how it works and maybe in the future i'm gonna"
312000,324400," improve it right so all right so okay what i wanted to do what i wanted to do i wanted to implement some"
324400,331600," sort of like um particle effects i suppose and the particle effects i wanna have is basically just"
331600,338480," something when the ball hits any of the surfaces right so essentially when the ball hits any of the"
338480,345680," surfaces we can you know emit a bunch of particles from that specific place and maybe it will look good"
345680,351440," i don't know i'm not a game developer so maybe it will look good i just want to try that and see how"
351440,362320," it goes okay so how can we detect a collision so if i take a look so we have a horizontal collision"
362320,367680," um okay so here are all the possible collisions that we can have we can have a bar collision"
368320,375600," uh bar collision is actually very interesting right it's a collision that prevents um the bar"
375600,382560," to penetrate the the ball right so and do we want to play anything in that"
382560,387600," um probably not so probably only care about horizontal and vertical collision"
389120,398000," so in horizontal and vertical collision uh so here we essentially hit either one of the sides right"
398000,406480," one of the horizontal sides or one or the bar uh and here we possibly um hit the target so in"
406480,410800," two of these places we'll have to play the the particle effect i suppose"
413360,420880," uh when are you going to do wordle clone the the thing is i don't really know how to play wordle so"
420880,429040," i'm really sorry i'm not american that's the thing uh i don't understand that meme"
429040,436000," and i was too lazy to actually learn about it so i'm really sorry"
442720,450160," so link in discord uh i it's too late to fix i'm sorry uh you found my stream anyway so that means"
450160,457760," the link is fine where are you from i'm from siberia it's like asian park or eurasian it's really really"
457760,468960," far away um geographically and culturally um sg pretty stable as the language at this point i couldn't break it"
468960,475920," so but i don't know i've been using it for like a week or so maybe maybe less uh maybe more i don't"
475920,485200," even know for how long i've been using but anyway all right so uh where we have the state of the game"
485200,489840," so here's the very simple state of the game so maybe we should introduce some sort of a particle"
489840,492800," right so let's actually introduce a structure which is going to be a particle"
492800,507120," so this is a structure and in here what we're going to have so what particle what a particle"
507120,512560," usually has right uh it usually has a position right so it's probably going to be something like"
513680,519840," x and y i should probably use vectors but for some reason already here for the for the targets right"
519840,524320," at the top i already use less separate variables so maybe i'm going to just follow this thing"
524320,536400," um okay so particle usually also has a velocity right so it's going to be dx float 32 right and dy"
537040,546320," so what else does it have it uh probably has a size because we probably want to play uh particles"
546320,551200," with different size so this is going to be a size and it's probably going to be something maybe from"
551200,557520," like so one is going to be the normal size right and uh less than one is going to be smaller and bigger"
557520,562480," than one it's going to be bigger all right so something like that so it's more of like a size multiplier"
563680,571360," um and probably some sort of a lifetime right for how long is it like it's been living uh maybe it's"
571360,576880," going to be some sort of a value in seconds that gets decreased uh on each frame by data time and as"
576880,582400," soon as it hits zero we're going to consider this particle dead something like that so that can be"
582400,592320," basically an idea uh all right so and since this is the state of the game uh we're gonna have an array of"
592320,599040," particles right so right now i'm not developing any sort of like a particle entity that manage everything"
599040,604720," i just throw everything in the global scope uh because it's easy for me to just like manage those"
604720,610240," things and uh at some point when the complexity grows too much i'm going to be grouping them into"
610240,615040," the structures and structuring everything properly right now i don't really care right so just put"
615040,627360," everything in the global state um how do you feel about jay jay is a programming language for developing"
627360,633920," software developing software is about engineering not about feelings okay"
636000,648160," got him um how do you get access to jay well i had to bribe a lot of people i'm joking so it wasn't right"
652160,655280," uh how do you engineering about jay that's a good question"
655280,667840," so the question is uh the array of particles what is it going to be is it going to be a resizable array"
667840,676320," or an array with a fixed size right so as we emit the particles right as we meet the particles we're gonna"
676320,686160," probably um simply uh append them right we're gonna append them to the array"
686160,694160," and when they die we want to be able to reuse some of the some of the particles right"
695760,706240," i want to reuse some of them so maybe if we had uh sort of like a limited capacity of the particles"
706240,714320," um it would be actually super easy to allocate a new particle by just iterating it like iterating this"
714320,720080," array like thousand thousand of particles is just like not too much so maybe iterating it is not that difficult"
724640,734960," it's being snarky required of course of course it is required"
734960,738960," all right"
738960,744480," uh yeah i think that's the easiest thing to do right now"
744480,747520," yeah that's actually pretty cool"
747520,753520," uh because every time if i want to allocate the particle i just like find the one with the"
753520,758800," lifetime less than zero and i just allocate that particle right so that's going to be the easiest"
758800,764160," thing to do okay that is fine so right now i suppose they're going to be all filled with zero"
764160,769840," it's a really damn approach okay right but we are making like a very simple game so it should be fine"
769840,778000," i think i think it should be fine hopefully um so here we reset the state of the game and do i want"
778000,783760," to do anything with the particles probably not i probably don't care uh anyways so let's"
783760,793360," um do something right let's do something so rendering we need to find the function that renders"
793360,801200," things uh so here we set the shader for the core then we render the projectile then the bar then the"
801200,806880," targets and then we probably want to render the particles so let's do particles right so this is the"
806880,812160," particles and we're going to render each individual particle in here so how we're going to be doing all"
812160,817680," of that um so we probably need to construct some sort of rectangle right so because we have function"
817680,829040," fill rectangle uh right uh so let's call this particle erect particle rect and this one let's call it"
829040,845600," particle color right so what's gonna be the particle color i don't really know we can well by the way"
845600,852480," what if we have particles of different colors i think that's a cool idea right so depending on what"
852480,858240," you hit um it's going to play different um it's going to emit i think it's called the meat right"
858240,862560," so it's going to meet the particles of different colors so i think because of that we want to do"
862560,870640," something like color uh vector vector four right so you have a position you have a velocity size lifetime"
870640,874000," and the color right so i think i think that's actually pretty cool"
874000,886000," so random so because of that we take the color from here right so now i need to construct the particle"
886000,895760," rectangle rectangle right particle rect so in every rectangle if i remember correctly it's just x y uh"
895760,907520," all right uh particle erect so the position is going to be probably the position of this thing but i want"
907520,914000," the position of the particle to represent the center of the rectangle that we're you know drawing so that"
914000,920960," means i need to figure out the size right so initially i have a some sort of a size right so it's it um"
920960,928000," its size but its size is just a multiplier right so we need to have something like a particle size"
928000,936000," right it's a base size maybe we should call it like a base size right it's a base size and i'm going to put"
936000,941760," that into the configuration right away and it's going to be a float and the size is going to be let's say"
941760,949200," maybe 10 right so it's going to be roughly 10 uh and this is going to be the actual size that we use"
949200,954000," so if the position of the particle is going to be the center that means we need to subtract half of the"
954000,961680," size right so we're subtracting half of the size from x and then half of the size from y and then particle uh"
961680,967600," w becomes size and particle h becomes size and there you go we can render the particle"
967600,975600," interestingly enough can i do something very cool and put a using in here and just get rid of these"
975600,981360," things i think i should be able to do that i think that's pretty cool right so basically you import all"
981360,988240," of the names within the structure into the current scope and when you do x equals to that you assign to x in"
988240,993200," here which is actually pretty cool i really like that it makes it a little bit more readable i think"
993200,997280," maybe it actually depends readability is a very subjective thing right"
999920,1014000," uh all right"
1014000,1022960," so people are talking about garbage collection i wonder if you can implement uh garbage collection in jay i think"
1022960,1028800," you should be able to with the like with some sort of metaprogrammer or something like that maybe"
1028800,1035600," i'm just thinking yeah i guess"
1035600,1044880," general shop at your house by the way speaking of you know blasphemy i was thinking how to implement borrow"
1044880,1052320," checker for china because again you can intercept the compiler events right so that means"
1052880,1059520," you can actually like have enough information to like implement an actual borrow checker as the library"
1059520,1062880," so i was actually thinking about that"
1062880,1070080," oh yeah that's why i live in siberia by the way so nobody will get me"
1079120,1083520," all right so let's try to uh build this into anything okay"
1083520,1091920," first there we go so what do we have in here so if i go to semicolon still semicolons"
1091920,1094480," unbelievable"
1094480,1106560," okay cool so if i try to run the game right uh it it shouldn't break and it doesn't really slow down either"
1106560,1113280," right so just iterating thousands of things is not that much over over over computation so that should"
1113280,1122240," be fine i think though we don't really do anything um oh all of them are zero wait a second"
1122240,1133120," huh so that means they should be somewhere oh their colors are okay i see what's going on their colors are"
1133120,1138400," invisible that's why they're probably rendered somewhere here right and they're invisible so"
1138400,1146640," right now we are rendering 1024 invisible particles right in here or maybe in here i think i'm switch"
1146640,1153440," coordinates to be studying it here right so that's what we do right now uh we can try to put some sort of a"
1153440,1161200," color in here for instance um let's put a reddish color of some sort all right so it's gonna be like"
1161200,1167200," that and let's see do we see anything no we don't because i didn't rebuild this into anything of course"
1168800,1179840," uh and so then i'm gonna just like run this entire thing try break yeah you need to provide ah sorry i"
1179840,1182320," really like that it apologizes"
1182320,1193360," so i mean there's no really need to be sorry about that right it's my mistake but the compiler is still"
1193360,1201040," sorry uh for not being able to read my mind uh i appreciate that anyway so there we go so we have a"
1201040,1211440," couple of problems in here uh and declare target so something went horribly wrong um how how is that"
1212800,1220240," am i being an idiot like i didn't really do anything and it stopped compiling"
1220240,1228640," oh okay i'm sorry i should use first yeah i just realized that okay cool"
1228640,1234000," uh so i have to bring back this entire thing"
1234000,1240960," okay do we still render anything it's kind of strange that i still don't see anything"
1242160,1248160," so i would expect to see at least something but it really doesn't render anything"
1248160,1256080," uh so the size base particle size we can try to increase the base particle size to maybe 100"
1256080,1263280," right and maybe then we'll see if there's something no we don't see anything okay that's fine i suppose"
1263280,1267840," uh anyway so maybe i just need to continue developing this entire thing right"
1272080,1280000," so because i would expect i would expect i would expect to just like draw some stuff in there right"
1280000,1287600," so if i explicitly put some sort of a color uh in here right some specific color would it actually do"
1287600,1299200," anything no it doesn't do anything that is really that is really strange um but if i put something like"
1299200,1308080," that in here and then do something like ah well sure"
1308080,1320400," okay i see okay the size is zero right so it still renders thousands of the particles uh but their size"
1320400,1327600," is zero so to make them visible finally right so that's what i'm trying to achieve i need to also assign one to here"
1329840,1337440," and now they're visible so this is 1024 particles are rendered in the left top corner right"
1337440,1341280," so there you go uh"
1341280,1351920," now we can change the size to 10 and as you can see so here are all of the so all of the 1024 particles are"
1351920,1358080," tightly packed in the corner that's the power of this language that's what you can do in this language"
1358080,1365040," you can you can render thousands of particles in a corner can your zig do that i don't think so actually"
1365040,1367360," so um sorry"
1367360,1375200," uh it's a very efficient compressing i know um so one of the things i want to do in here right so i want to"
1375200,1381360," ignore the particles that are dead right there is no point in rendering the particle that is dead so if"
1381360,1389120," it lifetime is uh less or equal than zero right if it's less than zero then maybe you want to just"
1389120,1395360," continue and skip the entire particle right or maybe you want to go a little bit more modern and just like"
1395360,1402480," wrap everything like that because kids this day say that this is more readable again um ignoring the fact"
1402480,1408480," that readability is a very subjective thing but anyway um"
1408480,1424720," okay so let's go ahead and do that so thousands of particles uh it oh well i mean if if you want to"
1424720,1432080," do that you want to actually do something like this no no cool so not a single particle is rendered right now"
1432080,1439280," because we're ignoring everything that has lifetime zero or less so uh which is understandable uh cool"
1439280,1446960," so now maybe we want to emit a particle right so let's create a function uh particle"
1446960,1456560," single right so we're going to emit a single particle um so we want to emit it uh somewhere"
1457760,1467920," at a particular position i suppose right so the position is going to be x float 32 32 and y float 32"
1467920,1474960," um so right now we're going to hard code all the parameters or something also we want to have a"
1474960,1480240," particular color right so it's going to be vector four so this thing is not going to return anything it's"
1480240,1485920," just going to find uh any free particle and just allocate something there the way it's going to work the"
1485920,1491440," way it's going to work is that uh we're going to just iterate all of the particles right we're iterating"
1491440,1500000," all the all the particles and as soon as we find uh anything that has a less or equal than zero"
1500000,1505600," um lifetime we're going to allocate a new particle right there and we're going to break out of the"
1505600,1511040," uh of the loop so if you don't have enough uh particles right so it's not going to allocate anything"
1511040,1516240," so it's going to be capped at 1024. that way we don't have to think too much about memory management"
1516240,1520560," if you allocate too many particles they're just not going to be rendered right so that's basically the"
1520560,1524560," idea that's the entire memory management when it comes to this particle system it's a very dumb"
1524560,1530960," particle system but again i'm not a game developer okay so i don't know how to develop efficient particle"
1530960,1548960," systems um i know how to develop the ones that are super simple and dumb so how are you liking gi so"
1548960,1557520," far it's okay would you recommend me waiting for it i have no idea who you are why would i how can i even"
1557520,1566240," answer that question uh only you can answer that question nobody knows you better than you"
1566240,1570240," so i cannot answer that question"
1570240,1580080," okay so we're gonna have in here uh we need to start at a particular position right so this is going to be"
1580080,1587200," that and this is going to be that so the next thing is that we need to uh create some sort of a velocity"
1587200,1594960," right uh first of all we probably need to uh pick a random direction right so we need to pick a random"
1594960,1602560," direction in which we're going to be moving um so"
1602560,1612960," the question is uh so we're going to have a random angle right so this is a random angle"
1614400,1623760," and essentially i need to be able to have a random value from zero to one right if i could have random"
1623760,1632720," value from uh zero to one i could then multiply this thing by two pi and get a random angle which i then"
1632720,1643120," could use uh for so x is cosine right like like this and then for dy uh for the sine right and then here"
1643120,1654320," somewhere i could say something like particle base velocity right so this is a particle base velocity"
1654320,1660960," and we could probably also multiply that thing uh by a random value"
1660960,1670480," by a random value so i don't remember how do you do random stuff in jai so i probably need to look up the"
1671120,1677360," uh the the modules right so that's how i usually do so i'm gonna grab uh maybe it's somewhere in basics"
1677360,1682560," right so do we have random i don't remember i think i used it once right so i think i used it once"
1683920,1688880," um so let's do it once right so let's do it once right so let's do it once right so let me let me see"
1688880,1696560," you grab rn right right do we have something like rand"
1696560,1706640," or duren"
1706640,1711040," i don't remember"
1711040,1713440," random"
1713440,1721920," maybe it makes sense to actually look that in basics right because this is where you would put that um"
1725520,1728400," um"
1728400,1733520," okay this is a bit painful uh i don't remember where it was"
1733520,1738320," okay so there is a whole module called random okay so that's that's fine"
1738320,1745680," so random get and you can just get a random okay that's perfect that is perfect so random seed um"
1747280,1754560," so we can do within the ranch for floats okay this is basically get zero it's even cold get zero to one"
1758880,1764800," it's even cold almost like i call it what the all right so i mean it's fine"
1764800,1772720," all right"
1774480,1783200," uh cool so we can do something like that so this is the angle and uh also maybe i'm gonna have a"
1783200,1789200," different velocity but i'm not really sure how yeah we'll see we'll see we'll see um"
1791600,1799280," so yeah we have a velocity now the size the size is going to be something like"
1801200,1803280," i t size"
1803280,1813280," and i suppose for now random um within the range and the range is going to be zero five"
1813280,1822160," to one five right so it could be half of its original size or more than you know one like"
1822800,1829360," one and a half of the original size something like this i think um all right so and the color"
1829360,1835360," uh its original color is going to be the one that we assigned so this is the color"
1835360,1846160," and lifetime is going to be particle particle base i'm not really base but just just lifetime right so"
1846160,1848800," something like this"
1848800,1854720," don't you call this velocity"
1854720,1856720," okay"
1856720,1862880," okay so"
1862880,1867440," random get so we need to include the random"
1867440,1873920," okay so particle based velocity i'm gonna go here"
1874480,1879520," and something went wrong and declared identifier oh because i never actually did that so the base"
1879520,1885360," velocity is going to be let's say around like 100 right so something like 100"
1885360,1894720," so what else do we have lifetime and particle let's go lifetime"
1899040,1904320," so it's going to float float and lifetime how many seconds uh let's say it's going to live for"
1904320,1906880," uh half of a second and"
1906880,1912400," cool that's pretty cool"
1912400,1922960," uh and now we need some sort of um emitting process right so but the question is like if you want to emit the"
1922960,1929280," particles you emit them with a particular period right so you emit them with a particular period"
1929280,1937200," uh why the parentheses in the constants because the constants could be hot reloaded"
1938480,1946080," all right so here's the thing uh the constants are coming from params dot conf right so we're taking"
1946080,1953920," this thing and we are generating uh this kind of stuff right so essentially each function call"
1953920,1965440," gets that value from the hash table but uh if i change uh this thing to false right and recompile it"
1965440,1970400," yet again uh let me try to do that one more time all right"
1973040,1981760," it sort of bakes all of these values in here so these parameters are can be either runtime or compile"
1981760,1988000," time depending on the build right so in the sort of release builder get baked uh in a debug build they"
1988000,1993520," are hot reloaded constantly that's why the call so it could have been done a little bit more clear"
1993520,1999840," right clean a little bit more clean uh for instance maybe i could have a meta program that would"
1999840,2006880," find all of the constants like this and for debug build it would replace them to function calls but"
2006880,2010800," uh for the release build it will leave them constant so the compiler has like"
2010800,2018160," easier time to fold in everything because i'm not sure if the compiler right now would inline such"
2018160,2025920," functions and then fold the constants because that was my hope by implementing all of that so but that's"
2025920,2031520," basically the general idea i did all of that just to learn about meta programming in giant like generally"
2031520,2038560," how to do that um so it's a really hacky and dirty solution but this is because i'm only learning things"
2038560,2047360," and uh yeah that makes sense so essentially these are parameters uh these are basically parameters that"
2047360,2054720," probably has to be compile time but during the development it's kind of nice to have them run time right"
2054720,2062320," because you want to hold reload them which probably is not really that important i don't think it's"
2062320,2067120," that important of an issue it's more of an exercise right so all of that is more of an exercise if i"
2067120,2073040," was doing like a like an actual commercial thing i would probably not care about this kind of stuff"
2073040,2078400," until it's actually needed right so all of that is not really actually needed it's just like whatever"
2079120,2087200," uh just playing with things just experimenting with things um do they get a lot of other games right"
2087200,2095280," of course so let me go and build it's not something new jai already has a thing that allows you to hold"
2095280,2099920," to reload the the configuration just like didn't use that because i wanted to learn about metaprogramming"
2101040,2107840," uh all right so okay let me actually run it right away"
2107840,2116640," so if i go to programs and for instance i find the background color uh i can change it and then hot"
2116640,2121600," reload it so the game is still running as you can see it is still running so at any point i can just do"
2121600,2130800," something like boom and keep trying so something like this so it's not something special or new"
2130800,2136400," people have been doing that even before j existed right so they just had like a separate meta problem"
2136400,2142240," okay"
2142240,2150640," all right so let's actually focus on the uh on the thing that we actually need to do okay so we need"
2150640,2154400," some sort of a period right we need some sort of a period um"
2154400,2168000," particles uh emitter period right so this is going to float and in here particle"
2168000,2178560," in meter period right so and how for how quickly let's actually say it's going to be also half half of that"
2179280,2186960," align with regular expressions there we go um emitter period so let's find the update"
2186960,2193760," so here if everything is not paused or started we do this thing okay"
2197280,2206800," okay emitter period okay emitter period uh minus dt if emitter period is less or equal than zero that means"
2206800,2214400," the time has come particle emit all right so we're emitting a particle"
2214400,2226880," where where are we emitting a particle we can actually try to emit a particle at the projectile position okay so we have a projectile position"
2226880,2232720," and basically we're going to have a trail of particles for the projectile so in the color i don't even"
2232720,2237200," know what kind of color we're going to put in there let's actually put something reddish uh"
2237200,2242960," right something like this so this is going to be a reddish color and after that i'm going to do emitter"
2242960,2246720," period and it's going to be equal to particle emitter period there we go"
2248160,2259040," um all right so that should be it hopefully let's try to combine the entire thing and uh yeah there we go"
2259040,2261040," so this is the particle we need"
2261040,2270720," this is a particle system so what's the problem with such particle system well the particles are not updated"
2270720,2277520," they're rendered but they're not updated all right so that's kind of kind of kind of a problem"
2277520,2282480," all right so let's actually iterate through the particles right so here are the particles"
2282480,2289120," and what we're going to do with them uh first of all we need to update their position right so we have"
2289120,2298000," to do something like plus uh dx multiplied by dt uh and here i also want to replace x with y there we go"
2298000,2306960," so we are updating the position so which is already kind of nice um all right so now as you can see"
2306960,2313200," the position is updated so they're flying somewhere they're flying somewhere which is pretty cool"
2315120,2321760," so but the the thing is they don't die they never die they're gonna at some point they're gonna waste"
2321760,2327600," the entire allocated like memory for them and that is it there will be no more particles so what we need"
2327600,2332000," to do in here we also need to update its lifetime so we need to take the lifetime and subtract the dt"
2332000,2341040," right so that means that at some point they're gonna actually uh die as you can see they die but when"
2341040,2348000," they die they sort of disappear which which kind of sucks don't you think i think it kind of sucks that"
2348000,2356400," they just and snap out of existence like it sucks so what we want to do is probably change its score"
2356400,2362640," depending on the lifetime so maybe uh depending on the lifetime is going to have a different"
2362640,2368560," transparency right so let's put let's do something like that so okay so this is the"
2370000,2374480," oh this one is really interesting so i'm using just like a random color but i supposed to use the"
2374480,2382720," the particle color the one that comes in here uh but i wonder if there is like an easy way to update"
2382720,2389440," the alpha of the color if you know what i mean maybe there is no right so but the idea is the following"
2389440,2395440," so i'm going to assign the color uh and then like that and then take the alpha right so and since the"
2395440,2401600," color is vector four it's going to be w so what i need to do in here i need to take the current lifetime"
2401600,2406560," right and divide it by the maximum lifetime uh of the particles so this is going to be something like"
2406560,2411120," this uh particle lifetime so i'm going to just divide it like that and there we go this is the"
2411120,2416640," color that i want to have in here so maybe there is a way to do that in line but i just did it in two"
2416640,2422800," lines it doesn't really matter that much okay so let's take a look at what's going to happen uh and"
2422800,2429920," it didn't work i really like that i really like the fact that it didn't work i wonder why"
2434560,2446320," x y z w i would expect that this would work so that's kind of strange so let me let me try to"
2446320,2448560," print the color and just see what's going on"
2448560,2461600," uh-huh okay so and it it goes down at some point yeah it does in fact go down so but it just doesn't"
2461600,2465680," take that into account for some reason is that something that i have to do for alpha"
2465680,2471600," you have set you have to set the shader oh okay"
2471600,2482000," uh or oh okay you probably don't know okay so i should not listen to the chat because the chat"
2482000,2489760," usually debates me uh all right so let me take a look um let me see"
2489760,2500560," blend so i probably want to also do something like this so there is a gl blend enable uh but can the use"
2501120,2515680," shade uh so there we go so this is i suppose this is what we need to do in here so enable blend"
2516480,2537840," um now let's go to here okay and it didn't work very cool um because it's false um print"
2541920,2549600," and okay so as you can see now they sort of disappear right they sort of disappear but you"
2549600,2557520," can notice a very interesting thing the period is too big the period is too big they're really sparse"
2557520,2562640," so let's actually go maybe i don't even have to restart i don't know why i keep restarting because"
2562640,2568960," i have a hot reloading right so i can just do something like this uh right and then i can go to"
2568960,2575680," the parameters and for example uh change the period like in half right and then i'm gonna just a second"
2575680,2580000," hot reload it and as you can see it actually emits them a little bit faster right it means"
2580000,2588000," them a little bit faster we can make them emit even faster like more than half uh right so now it is"
2588000,2593520," like that maybe they should leave a little bit longer uh right so maybe they should leave a little"
2593520,2598800," bit longer but apart from that it's kind of fine so what about like just one uh"
2598800,2606480," yeah that's actually looks fine what about half of one right so yeah it actually looks pretty nice so"
2606480,2612720," that's the particles and now maybe i'm gonna make the lifetime a little bit longer right so because"
2612720,2617120," half of a second is probably not that much so let's actually make them live a bit longer"
2617120,2619360," yeah that's that's pretty cool"
2621360,2630240," so the base size is probably too big what about five right so they are now even smaller so if we"
2630240,2636640," increase the period like like this oh that that looks fine i really like how it looks like look at that"
2642240,2649920," it's pretty cool"
2649920,2656560," so we can make them live even longer like two seconds right how about two seconds and now they're like"
2656560,2662080," like this yeah yeah boy"
2664400,2671520," uh so what if the base size is like 20 right so yeah there we go now we're talking so this is a bait size"
2671520,2673520," uh"
2673520,2680720," it's not emitting from the center though who cares this is a debug code"
2683520,2691520," who cares if it's immediate from the center we're debugging particle system uh what's important is that"
2691520,2698640," they're emitted at all uh from somewhere uh they're emitted from somewhere okay"
2701120,2703760," pretty cool pretty cool i could watch it forever it's so nice"
2703760,2714880," is this hardware accelerated yes it is accelerated by 10 years old hardware my laptop"
2714880,2727680," can you can you make it fade from red to orange i guess i can but that's kind of interesting thing"
2728960,2732960," all right so let me let me see"
2732960,2739520," i don't know why but we can try to do that so the final color could be"
2739520,2742560," all right this is the orange"
2742560,2756560," so i remember that there was a lerp so you could learn from this color to another color right and the"
2756560,2760800," lurking thingy the lurking thingy could be something like this"
2760800,2768800," i suppose what you want to lurk it to right what you want to look it to you want to lurk it to"
2768800,2774560," more of a more like a yellowish right so something like this"
2774560,2783840," uh-huh and then once we get that i can put it well i mean i can just put it into the color right so and"
2783840,2787280," maybe that will uh make something all right"
2787280,2797760," well that went kind of wrong so if i'm lurking i actually kind of have to invert it but if i'm"
2797760,2804800," inverting it i could could have just done it like that uh right so i can just invert it like so"
2808000,2814080," yeah what the fuck i'm gonna do it then um is that what i have to do"
2814080,2823040," yeah is that what you want right so it well it's not really into the orange but into it"
2823040,2827520," it's fading into the yellow uh which kind of yeah"
2830720,2847920," something like this so and i probably have to blend the colors a little bit more"
2847920,2858320," uh like smarter right so i have to use them for instance when i initialize i have to do the gamma"
2858320,2864320," correction right so i need to take sRGB to linear and do the linear transformations in the linear space"
2864320,2870960," right and then convert back to sRGB right so that way is going to be like more linear uh if you know"
2870960,2878480," what i mean um so this is basically what i do when i generate the uh the rainbow color for the targets"
2878480,2884800," right uh so i'm also linearly interpolating uh these colors but i do that in the linear space like"
2884800,2890000," converting things around and that way it it's actually more like uniform um"
2890000,2897520," i could probably demonstrate how it looks like without it oh yeah i think i think i can demonstrate"
2897520,2905120," you how uh the rainbow looks without the gamma correction right so because i made a commit at some point"
2905840,2911920," uh on the github so something about the gamma yeah gamma correction there we go"
2911920,2922160," so and here is the uh screenshot so on the left you can see without gamma correction i'm not sure if you"
2922160,2926960," can see that but on the left you can see it in the gamma correction and on the right gamma corrected right"
2926960,2934000," so without gamma correction gamma correction so if we take a look at the uh the difference right um"
2934000,2936320," just play rich diff"
2936320,2945120," it was a way okay so here is a small uh okay so look at this orange color uh look at this orange color so"
2945120,2953120," without gamma correction it's a little bit darker right so essentially it uh basically interpolates very"
2953120,2960560," quickly it fades into red too quickly quicker than it's neat so it doesn't really look like uniform"
2960560,2965680," uh so that's basically the problem in here so if i want to fade the particles a little bit like more"
2965680,2973840," nicer i probably have to do a similar thing um right so you can clearly see this thing if you're interested"
2973840,2976400," i'm going to give you the the link to this specific comment"
2976400,2987200," it's general did you get the product i got into close better yes um all right i can also put that"
2987200,2991120," in the description just in case somebody's watching us on youtube right so because i'm going to be"
2991120,2998960," uploading all that on youtube too uh where is the description right so gamma correction"
3001280,3005600," diff"
3005600,3014400," first rule of java better is you don't talk about java better why wouldn't you talk about java better"
3014400,3020080," it makes people jealous why would you miss such an opportunity to make people i don't understand"
3020080,3025680," no it doesn't make any sense to me if you enjoy better you better talk about being enjoyed better"
3026880,3030480," uh i'm joking of course"
3030480,3048240," all right so okay we have particles right so that's cool uh the thing is the thing is"
3048960,3052400," what if i want to have several particle emitters at different points"
3052400,3065120," so maybe i'll have to create um i didn't want to do that but i have a feeling that i need to create"
3065120,3072400," the particle emitter entity right structure uh though if we're gonna have several particle emitters"
3072400,3078720," they they can use the same particle pool anyway right so we could probably use the same particle pool"
3078720,3091920," so and what's interesting is that i want to have several particle emitters"
3092960,3096000," uh that live for some period of time uh that live for some period of time"
3096000,3103840," you know what i mean because here's the thing so you probably hit"
3103840,3113280," i'll have to think right you hit different surfaces right so and when you hit the surface you should"
3113280,3120240," emit a bunch of particles for some short period of time right for some short period of time you should"
3120240,3126480," limit them and since you can have several collisions you can have several collisions"
3126480,3132160," uh several of the particle emitters should live simultaneously so they should be sort of concurrent"
3132160,3138640," particle emitters so what i'm thinking is that maybe we can have also a pool of particle emitters"
3138640,3148560," right so that kind of acts in a similar way right when you hit something you spawn a particle emitter"
3148560,3156400," that lives for a short period of time that keeps spoiling particles right that's actually interesting"
3156400,3165280," idea maybe this is what we should do um should the place you have hit in the course of the bar you hit"
3165280,3171440," well i said that like several minutes ago and the answer is yes and this is why i introduced the core"
3171440,3183440," field into the particle um so i think this is what i'm going to do so the thing why i like that is"
3183440,3190560," because the particle emitters themselves become kind of like uh particles right in some sense anyway so no"
3190560,3199840," nobody cares um particle emitter right so we're gonna have a single particle emitter and the particle emitter"
3199840,3206800," probably should have the base uh place right so the base position so where is it located so and"
3206800,3215760," also the base color right so all of these parameters and it should probably have a lifetime right so"
3215760,3227040," so something like this uh maybe let's actually call it emitting it's kind of difficult to tell and uh"
3227040,3230320," emitter period is basically the lifetime of a single particle emitter"
3230320,3241600," i watched your first few jay votes it was interesting to see someone approaching the"
3241600,3248080," language with relatively fresh eyes well yeah even then i knew a little bit of jay because i was was"
3248080,3254240," watching streams right so anyone who's watching john streams they know a little bit about how to use the"
3254240,3260000," language already so but i never like tried it myself oh yeah i already said that okay"
3260000,3267200," okay"
3267200,3276160," particle emitters right so we're gonna have several of them and how many particle emitters do we want to have"
3276960,3286720," uh we can have i would say something like maybe 128 we don't really need too many of them right we"
3286720,3294640," definitely need more particles than particle emitters uh particle emitter single one right and there we go"
3294640,3305520," so particle emit and i suppose all right i suppose in here"
3307520,3318800," we need to accept a particle emitter instead of uh a single particle yeah i think that's what we need to do"
3324080,3328160," since you're in russia at the moment to assume you don't have access to twitchery and you're right"
3328160,3329040," yes i don't have it"
3329040,3337600," so what i'm thinking is that i want to"
3337600,3347920," have a function that accepts particle emitter right and updates the particle meter so we need to have something"
3347920,3356320," like uh particle emitter uh update right so this is a particular mirror update uh and then we can have a"
3356320,3359120," meter uh which is a pointer to particle meter"
3363440,3369280," uh meter and we also need to accept the delta time right so this is the data time"
3369280,3377440," okay cool um and i suppose i need to take this entire code right so"
3378000,3382240," uh huh i think this is straight up particle emitter update"
3382240,3390000," right it's just like instead of emitter period we have a lifetime"
3390000,3392720," no not really"
3392720,3398720," period is its own thing yes"
3401360,3410400," period is its own thing lifetime is its own thing as well so if lifetime is uh lesser"
3410400,3415600," equal than zero that means we return and we don't do anything we literally ignore this thing"
3416320,3425520," then we take the period all right and we perform these things um but instead of this thing i just use x"
3425520,3435040," y and the color all right so this is the color and then i also subtract the lifetime"
3435040,3445040," okay so i subtract the lifetime the period and the period is less that means we emit a new particle"
3445760,3447600," right so particular meter update"
3447600,3459600," okay cool so where is the excuse me am i an idiot okay"
3459600,3472080," okay i couldn't find update for some reason uh all right particle emitters right and then i do"
3472080,3477360," particle emitters it with dt you know what i'm gonna actually do it like that"
3477360,3479440," there you go"
3479440,3486880," you know what the the language has like function overloading maybe i could overload update"
3486880,3490080," uh it's actually too difficult to then keep track of things"
3491680,3498880," um all right so expect it uh yeah of course i can do that so what else do we have in here"
3498880,3502080," the hell"
3502080,3514320," what the hell has happened here i guess accidentally just corrupted something with emacs yeah okay uh"
3516880,3520640," this probably should not be here that's for sure i don't know what the hell is that but"
3520640,3526880," something weird has happened with emacs and it just like went crazy uh okay so as you can see we don't"
3526880,3533680," have an emitter right we don't have an emitter and maybe this is something that we now need to handle"
3534240,3539200," right uh we need to emit an emitter"
3539200,3546320," you know what i mean we need a thing that iterates through the emitters finds the dead emitter and"
3546320,3552640," creates a new one for a particular period of time emitception yes it is emitception"
3552640,3559840," uh so how are we going to call such functions function so it's going to be particle emitter emit"
3561600,3569440," again i'm not a game developer so i have no idea what i'm doing so i'm just like doing the most"
3569440,3575520," the thing that makes the most sense for me right i don't really have like a proper experience in like"
3575520,3582400," making games or anything like that so i'm probably doing an absolutely dumb thing but again i've learned"
3582400,3591040," right um anyway so we're gonna actually provide the position right so where is it going to live"
3592000,3595520," uh also we probably should provide the quarter right so it's going to be back to four"
3595520,3601920," and probably we should provide the lifetime why not like for how long this emitter is going to stay"
3601920,3606640," there right for how long is it staying there so and i'm going to just iterate through the particle"
3606640,3616160," mirrors uh particle emitters right and if the lifetime of this particular particle meter is less"
3616160,3621840," than zero that means we found the one and only the particle emitter we need not the particle mirror we"
3621840,3632160," deserve but the particle mirror we need and there we go let's actually initialize it so uh then i'm"
3632160,3638720," going to do something like x and y of course so the color is going to be the color that the user provided"
3638720,3646080," right the lifetime the lifetime is going to be the lifetime the user provided and the period i suppose"
3646080,3653520," is zero right so and after that we want to return so we just like emitted a particle emitter"
3654800,3666160," emitted a particle emitter uh all right cool so when do we want to emit a particle emitter well"
3666160,3672080," depending on what we hit so let's actually take a look at the collision right so here we have different"
3672080,3679680," sort of collisions so this is a collision for borders left and right borders so this is entirely"
3679680,3686880," horizontal collision so everything that happens here is a horizontal collision um so i think what i need to"
3686880,3694880," do i need to split the um border collision and the bar collision right so because depending on what we"
3694880,3703920," hit we're going to actually play things with different colors um so rafael luba i have pronounced your name"
3703920,3709440," correctly uh thank you so much for seven gifted subs uh thank you thank you thank you and everyone who got the"
3709440,3720160," the sub welcome to the epic chosen club thank you thank you so much so um okay so here if we hit the"
3720160,3729360," borders we probably should uh render the emitter with the core of the of the projectile right so that"
3729360,3738800," makes sense kind of so particle uh emitter emit right so the position is going to be the position of the"
3739440,3749680," right right of the projectile uh project y and by the way now we probably care uh about the"
3749680,3759600," rafael works on the compiler nice wow actually the compiler that's so cool what is point of gifting a sub"
3759600,3766560," well it kind of makes sense to gift us up because you get pretty cool emotes that i primarily draw myself"
3766560,3773680," right so majority of the emotes in this channel i drew myself also you get an automatic access to the"
3773680,3780720," discord if you subscribe because i still use subs as a waste of moderation uh even though i don't get"
3780720,3789040," any money so the money becomes some sort of a filter for people to uh prove that they're not spammers or"
3789040,3792800," anything like that and it actually reduces the amount of moderation work i have to do"
3792800,3800720," so yeah and maybe eventually eventually i don't know when i will get this money because twitch just"
3800720,3805760," accumulates them it's just like it cannot it cannot pay them off to me um but it keeps the money"
3808480,3815360," yeah there's a lot of reasons to do that anyway so and of course the most important reason you make the"
3815360,3823920," jeff bezos more rich right why wouldn't you want to do that um okay so here"
3823920,3831920," we need to take the projectile size right we need to take the projectile size"
3833040,3836400," and add half of it right so we're going to be adding half of it"
3836400,3845360," right so that way is going to be at the center and the color that we're going to be using right"
3845360,3850640," since since we're hitting the border is the projectile color uh why is it here though i think"
3850640,3866720," i need to actually put related things in like clothing together so this is approach color and lifetime i'm"
3866720,3872720," not really sure about the lifetime so it's more of a like um emitter lifetime right so we're gonna have"
3872720,3878400," something like that um maybe particle emitter"
3878400,3886560," particle emitter lifetime lifetime lifetime and for how long they're gonna live i don't even know maybe"
3886560,3895440," they're gonna leave if the period is this should it leave for it's actually very interesting right so if i set"
3895440,3905120," the period to this if i set the period to this and then i set the lifetime to this that means it's gonna"
3905120,3912000," emit like 10 particles so i can sort of like um measure it out to some sense right"
3912000,3918320," oh it's actually pretty interesting okay we'll see we can experiment with that we can experiment with that"
3918320,3927280," anyway uh basically in your lifetime all right so and in here okay so the only difference between"
3927280,3931840," these two calls is the core so maybe i could actually express that a little bit better but whatever"
3931840,3940640," so here when the ball hits the hits the bar we want to actually play it with the bar color"
3940640,3942240," right so this is going to be bar color"
3944560,3950400," this is a bar color and now if we hit one of the targets and all that horizontally by the way"
3950400,3955600," one of the targets we want to play the color of the target itself right"
3955600,3965280," oh this one is interesting we have a special function that registers the target here so i can"
3965280,3973360," play the particles in there right and that actually saves me a lot of code duplication right target"
3974560,3983200," heat right because it happens on both horizontal and vertical uh hip of the target right and i can"
3983200,3994320," just take the target uh target color i think it just has a color um oh and of course um i always use the"
3994320,4002080," projectile it would be kind of cool to actually play the particles at the point of heating"
4003600,4005680," but it's i'm too lazy to actually do that"
4005680,4014640," is there a game where everything is a particle in the time uh depends on on the definition of particle"
4014640,4015440," mirror i suppose"
4015440,4031520," which one will dominate in the c space jay zik or air so here's the thing i think language doesn't really matter"
4032880,4044960," um in making language popular right uh so let me put it this way the language by itself doesn't make"
4044960,4051520," itself popular right so it's not really the features that make the language popular it's rather"
4051520,4056560," uh how many talented programmers are using this language"
4057760,4065840," the popularity of the the popularity of the language depends it correlates very strongly to the amount of"
4065840,4069520," talented people who use it right so"
4069520,4078720," i hate that game which one right right anyway so speaking of which language is going to become more"
4078720,4086000," popular and it's going to dominate the you know c space the one that attracted more talented developers"
4087040,4091760," now here's the question this is a very important question and you have to answer it honestly"
4091760,4100640," which language zeke or jay attracts more talented developers i'm not going to answer that question"
4100640,4106080," you have to answer that question for yourself the language itself and the feature of the language"
4106080,4112880," don't really matter that much in becoming popular specifically in becoming popular they're important for"
4112880,4119040," like other things but for becoming popular they're not that normal so what's important is who attracting"
4119040,4124720," more talented developers who can actually make things who can deliver things uh who can come up with"
4124720,4138560," interesting ideas um a rust easy well this is one of the reasons why rust became popular"
4138560,4149760," all right anyway maybe i'm wrong so i know nothing about uh making popular languages because they haven't"
4149760,4153920," created the popular language so i don't know what do i know"
4153920,4167120," i just wish we stop you organizing things yeah um same so the the you're analyzing things i can kind of"
4167120,4178400," distracts from from actual development anyway so particle meter so this is the particle target color and"
4179360,4183760," so the only thing i need to do now is to handle the vertical collision and in the vertical collision i"
4183760,4192400," already have a separation between the bar and the uh and the borders so i can quite easily just copy paste"
4192400,4202000," whatever i have in here uh and whatever i have in here and there we go so now when we collide with things"
4202720,4209760," we actually create emitters but i have no idea if it's gonna suck i'm pretty sure this entire thing is"
4209760,4219440," going to suck so let's actually see how much um is it going to suck okay so it has enough time"
4220560,4225680," to play like a single particle to play like a single particle you know what i mean"
4225680,4232880," so maybe it should actually leave a little bit longer right"
4241040,4246560," okay and of course i think the um the particle"
4246560,4253120," the particle size should be smaller of course"
4253120,4258480," uh so let me say the particle size is going to be around five right"
4263200,4268720," doesn't look that bad"
4268720,4278480," maybe maybe the emitters could live a little bit longer uh let's actually make it twice twice of that"
4278480,4286320," all right you can't see much because we're hitting like a different space"
4287520,4293520," can you even see that can can you even see what's going on there i think it's fine okay i kind of"
4293520,4297120," like how it's how it's going so far um"
4297120,4313440," it's kind of also the the speed with which you can emit the particles is limited by the fps as well"
4313440,4321520," right so what we probably have to do we probably have to handle dt more properly so essentially if dt"
4321520,4327840," is bigger than the emitter period it's not going to really work well you know what i mean um so that's"
4327840,4328560," kind of the problem"
4328560,4340560," so that's why we actually see less particles that we should have so i think this is something that we have"
4340560,4347280," to handle properly but so far apart from that dt bug i think it looks kind of nice is it even visible on"
4347280,4348080," the on the screen"
4348080,4357360," i started judging languages but what is actually made in them i think it's a it's a good idea actually"
4357360,4364080," some years ago lisp was supposedly best at everything and then it was haskell"
4366960,4376400," it had anything that is made in those languages that is being used by anyone yeah but facebook spam filter"
4376400,4384960," the main the main argument of the haskell developers every time you start to criticize haskell for not"
4384960,4392720," being used anywhere there's the whip out the the ultimate argument the spam filter at facebook that"
4392720,4402240," literally nobody has seen some mythical spam filter at facebook it is developed behind the closed doors"
4402240,4409440," nobody ever see that spam filter but it's there and it's written in haskell and it makes this language great"
4410560,4425120," so if it doesn't even work yeah um yeah don't you dare say anything about haskell spam filters at facebook"
4425120,4428240," spam filters at facebook"
4430480,4431840," anyway anyway uh"
4431840,4441840," considering facebook only has a spam for content that doesn't give me high hopes yeah exactly"
4441840,4458800," considering like how all of these companies operate like twitter google and facebook their spam filters are not"
4458800,4469520," really spam filters their competitors filters so what they do they don't really filter spam they are eliminating the competition"
4469520,4478080," that's what they are effectively because they don't want anyone else spam to compete with theirs you know what i mean"
4479360,4488640," that's what they're gonna do they don't want to do it because they don't want anyone else to do it"
4488640,4488960," well i don't want anyone else to do it because they don't want anyone else to do it but i don't want anyone else to do it"
4488960,4492640," i know almost nothing about facebook because i never use it in my entire life"
4492640,4498080," like seriously i don't even know how the uh the front page of facebook looks like like i've never used it"
4498080,4513760," i had to create a facebook uh account after 30 years of my life because everyone in serbia use it"
4513760,4536400," isn't russia using something like vk over facebook yes i never used vk either"
4536720,4545280," uh yes uh everyone is talking about facebook vk and stuff like i never used any of those things"
4545280,4547520," like i have no idea what they are um"
4547520,4556960," oh yeah i also use blue plus okay so what i want you to fix i want you to actually fix the emitting"
4557600,4565200," uh emitting thingy so when i update so here is the interesting thing"
4565200,4575280," so this is a period right so"
4575280,4585520," if this thing is less than zero right if this thing is less than zero what i need to do i need to take an"
4585520,4593520," absolute value of that period look closer i take the absolute period of that thing um so if dt"
4593520,4600720," is bigger than the particle emitter period if it is bigger so that means that value the absolute value"
4600720,4607120," of the period may also be bigger than the particle meter period so i take this thing and divide it by that"
4607120,4614880," and that gives me the amount of particles that i have to emit essentially you know what i mean"
4615600,4621840," um so it's gonna be rough it's probably there will be some sort of like an off by one error somewhere"
4621840,4627840," there because there's also a remainder that i'm gonna ignore but it's just one particle right it's"
4627840,4632720," gonna be just one particle it's off by one and it's like effect it doesn't really affect too much so i think"
4632720,4638720," i'm gonna be fine with any of the bugs off by one bugs that i introduce in here like i really don't care"
4639280,4644480," um so and we can do something like this i'm also going to cast it to integer right and there we go"
4644480,4652480," so and the thing i want to do in here is essentially just iterate n times right so i'm iterating n times"
4652480,4661680," though if this thing is less that means i actually want to iterate it like that all right so and that's"
4661680,4670560," how many particles i want to do right so because of that this may generate on the particles i think i think"
4670560,4678880," it may generate but we'll see so we can kind of do a similar thing for uh particle emitter emit i don't"
4678880,4686160," know really no we don't have to do that so i suppose we only need to do that here uh okay so did it"
4686160,4696080," recompile i should probably use something like this oh now that's what i was talking about"
4696080,4707200," this is precisely what i was talking about right so uh we didn't see enough particles now it's just a"
4707200,4715520," fire or fireworks i really like that it's actually really fun it's it's literally fireworks yeah but"
4715520,4718240," it takes into account the dt proper more or less"
4718240,4727600," i really like that there's something to it don't you think i think i think it's pretty cool"
4727600,4734640," anyway so that only means that we need to adjust all of these things right so we need to adjust them"
4734640,4744240," so the maybe the emitter period has to be 10 times smaller right so yeah it is better now"
4744880,4752880," right it is a tiny bit better right the period is not as crazy anymore as crazy uh but maybe the"
4752880,4762080," emitter itself should live a bit longer right so what if we make it live twice as long right so and since"
4762080,4770960," it leaves it leaves twice as long it just manages to emit more particles right or something like that"
4770960,4781360," so in the particles themselves maybe they should live uh a little bit shorter right"
4784160,4790480," uh that's weird okay that's fine"
4790480,4808000," by the way do we do we vary the velocity of this thing i don't remember i think we don't vary the velocity"
4808000,4816720," let's actually quickly fix that uh joy break break joy something something uh so when i create this"
4816720,4822160," we do not vary the velocity look at that okay so i can do kind of a similar thing i can just"
4823680,4833200," um yeah so sort of a parameter t and i just multiply by that parameter in here right there we go so i"
4833200,4838560," mean the the length of the velocity uh so variation for the length of the velocity"
4840880,4846240," okay okay so that's a little bit better so they're not really circular anymore if you know what i mean"
4846240,4852480," uh but now the emir just leaves for too long i think uh so i'm going to"
4854160,4860640," change the emir lifetime back to what it was like once of the seconds okay"
4860640,4873680," that's fine that is actually fine all right i really like that so of course there's no death"
4873680,4878800," uh condition yet because i haven't implemented yet uh but we're going to implement it at some point"
4880160,4889280," nice so let me make the period maybe slightly faster just slightly a little bit is it is going to be too"
4889280,4898400," much i think i think that's fine okay so velocity where is the velocity velocity is 100 what if it's"
4898400,4908320," going to be a little bit faster hmm so it it looks a bit more impactful oh i really like that so if we"
4908320,4917280," yeah yeah so it feels like they hit with a greater force you know uh okay so i can change the size of"
4917280,4922720," the particles right so it's a little bigger so we can see them a bit better uh but maybe it's too big"
4922720,4932080," all right so and so they actually spread too much so because of that i think i want to reduce their"
4932080,4940640," lifetime right so they actually die a bit faster hopefully uh what about like half"
4940640,4945600," yeah so they die a bit faster now"
4945600,4955360," oh and by the way i just realized that i still have this weird fading from to an orange color that's why it"
4955360,4963760," looks so weird um yeah i need to fix that as well so it was experimental thing uh update and when i render"
4964640,4980080," so what i wanted to do so i essentially wanted to just have it color then color w and"
4980080,4987600," just this thing so that's the only thing i want to do all right so let's recompile this entire thing and"
4987600,4996560," uh yep yep so so now it's it's the same color it's the color of the thing you hit right so it's literally"
4996560,4999760," the color of that thing you hit more or less"
4999760,5006480," cool so i think this is roughly what i wanted um"
5010880,5012960," i don't know why i studied the whole game but yeah"
5012960,5020000," okay the purple"
5020000,5028480," bonus challenge may particle bounce on the bricks that would be also kind of interesting"
5028480,5034640," so that will require you know what that will require actually factoring out the collision detection so"
5034640,5040240," right now collision detection is sort of hard coded on the projectile right so"
5040880,5048720," that means you have to generalize it to work with any rectangle so and that's a little bit of work"
5048720,5050000," which i can take"
5050000,5058320," uh which i can take uh after a small break so"
5058320,5064400," do something like a combo counter yeah we're gonna do that where the mirrors emit more particles"
5064400,5072000," as a combo countering that's an interesting idea yeah so like the intensity of the of the thing"
5072000,5078400," that sounds interesting yeah we we kind of developed the particle system right it wasn't too hard"
5078400,5084720," and we didn't even have any engine for that you have to have an engine to develop a game"
5085280,5089600," i just have a particle system without any engine about that not a single engine"
5089600,5099040," not a single company will tell me oh you have to pay us if you want to sell the game no i don't use"
5099040,5102160," any engine i just like develop this thing myself without any engine how about that"
5103840,5105680," i bet you didn't expect that to happen"
5105680,5112400," all right so i think i need to make a break right so let's make some break um"
5112400,5120960," all right so uh let's implement the last thing right so the last last thing for today is going to be"
5120960,5127920," um collision for the particles i think that is going to be very much interesting uh so right now as"
5127920,5139840," already said we only handle collision for the um for the projectile but we need to factor it out to"
5139840,5148800," any uh any rectangle right so that's what we need to do so the entire collision is handled by two calls"
5148800,5155760," horizontal collision and vertical collision right so in here we have the position project projectile right"
5155760,5162080," so this is the position of projectile and we use the size of the projectile to find stuff like that"
5162080,5170800," so basically what i think we need to uh make the projectile position a parameter that can be modified"
5170800,5179520," by this thing so essentially uh we need to pass um the position of something right it could be either"
5179520,5185120," particle or it could be projectile uh right so this is the position right and as you can see"
5185760,5188320," or maybe not so this is just a position"
5188320,5200720," oh the problem with this thing is that it also updates it also updates the position so updating the"
5200720,5209040," position and collision resolution is part of the collision detection because if there is a situation when"
5210080,5217120," collision collision is sort of inevitable uh collision will result is something bad the move is not made"
5217120,5227680," at all you know what i mean right so that's why the collision and movement are so tightly integrated"
5227680,5234400," together so i'm not sure if it's going to be easy to do that but i'll try i'll try i'll try so"
5238880,5244240," did john correct the weird error message with not okay yeah he did so i haven't checked it yet because"
5244240,5252800," it was released on recently uh but he said that he fixed it and i have no reason to not believe him"
5255040,5260960," all right so maybe because of that uh"
5260960,5271840," we're gonna use the same movement in here no i think it makes sense right so the movement of the"
5271840,5281040," uh of the particle is also going to be updated by the collision process i think that makes sense i think"
5281040,5292640," does in fact make sense all right so uh here so this is x and y and we also need to accept uh dx"
5292640,5304480," flow 32 and dy flow 32 so these are the things that we'll need to update right on top of that uh we also"
5304480,5310960," need to know the size of the thing we're you know uh checking the collision for so we need to have"
5310960,5317680," something like a width uh and the height of course of course i should probably switch to vectors but it's"
5317680,5322400," too much work right now so it will require going through the entire code base and refactor and i don't"
5322400,5325040," want to do it right now so i'm going to just like pass it as it is"
5325040,5334160," hello so do you think i can learn c as the first programming language i have no idea i don't know you"
5334160,5342400," you're the one who knows you the best so to answer that question you need to try right so try to learn"
5342400,5347600," it as a first language if you can do that the answer is yes you can learn c as a first language if"
5347600,5352480," you couldn't do that the answer would be no and maybe you should try a different language but i believe"
5352480,5355520," that you can so we should just try and see"
5355520,5366880," so these kind of questions you can only answer yourself"
5371200,5381280," just right okay so what we need to introduce in here is i suppose uh just rename just get rid of"
5381280,5390640," the all of the project uh underscore um prefixes right so we don't have that anymore um so speed"
5390640,5400080," yes speed doesn't make sense i think we have to do it like that right so this is absolutely new thing and"
5400080,5410320," x uh we'll have to do reference both nice code by the way so this is the oh oh this is actually pretty"
5410320,5418960," cool star is not the de-reference in jay the referencing is this so in c it would be actually"
5418960,5424240," kind of confusing right because this is de-referencing and this is multiplication right"
5425280,5430800," but in jay the referencing is this so and because of that it's just like this there we go"
5430800,5436960," all right"
5436960,5447680," okay and if we encounter this thing or we encounter this thing so the project size is going to be actually"
5447680,5453200," width okay i really like how parameterization actually makes this entire thing kind of"
5454160,5456080," kind of simpler i really like that"
5456080,5463360," you know what i think you know what i'm thinking"
5463360,5473040," um we need to signal in information about a collision upwards if you know what i mean"
5473040,5479760," right but we also need to somehow tell what exactly we hit"
5481600,5490000," right so of course i can return a boolean right so and here i can return true in case of detecting a"
5490000,5498480," collision right so i can do that uh and here i can return false but also i need to play i need to emit"
5498480,5505440," particles but since i'm going to be using this collision for particles as well i don't want the particles to"
5505440,5511680," emit more particles when they collide with something imagine right we're using this entire code right for"
5511680,5520080," for the particles as well right and each particle heat generates more particle so it's going to be like"
5520080,5526720," exponential explosion of the particles right that's why this kind of thing has to be decoupled from the"
5526720,5532880," collision detection right so we have a collision detection has to be decoupled from that"
5532880,5537360," uh oh righty so and the only reason"
5537360,5545440," like the only information we need is essentially the color of the thing that we hit"
5546240,5551760," it would be kind of nice to know what exactly we hit right but you can hit so many different things"
5551760,5558960," you can hit a border which is not an entity by itself you can hit a bar or you can hit a target"
5558960,5567040," right so we could just have an emeration to tell what exactly we hit right we can try to do something"
5567040,5576880," like that or we can return the color of whatever we hit which would be kind of weird you have a collision"
5576880,5584000," detection function that returns a color of the thing it hit and the color is the color that you should use"
5584000,5591680," for uh particle emission which kind of makes it too specific you know what i mean it kind of makes it too"
5591680,5600160," specific uh so what i'm thinking maybe it should be enumeration right so zero is going to be you hit the"
5600160,5608160," border one is going to be you hit the bar and bigger than one is going to be you hit the target"
5608160,5618720," we can even do something like um you can store the index of the target you hit right you can store the"
5618720,5625280," index of the target you hit uh so then you can extract the uh the color of the target if you want"
5625280,5630720," or something like that so that requires like this kind of refactoring unfortunately"
5630720,5645280," um all right so this one is rather interesting so if we're gonna have enumeration right so it's gonna"
5645280,5652960," be collision uh right we'll get a collision um no collision right so you can have no collision"
5652960,5662000," then you can have well zero is probably gonna be null right then you can have border right so this is"
5662000,5668640," one thing uh border bar targets right so here we have zero"
5670560,5680080," and essentially any anything bigger than target is the target right sometimes i don't quite remember"
5680080,5684800," how you define the enumeration of a particular type i think this is how we can do that right so we're"
5684800,5688160," going to just keep it like that all right and"
5691120,5700560," here we can just do collision right so we essentially return the collision so when i hit uh the border right"
5700560,5710720," so i can just say border then when i hit the bar i can just say bar when i hit the target i say target"
5712400,5720800," target plus an index but i don't remember how to get an index of a full for loop iteration"
5720800,5730080," so let me actually see i don't remember so opt uh jay module so maybe how to four um"
5732240,5743840," so i don't really know number types array for so this is the index that just gives me an index um"
5743840,5757120," i kind of remember in a hash table if we take a look at the hash expansion uh the first thing here is an index"
5757920,5762800," and then the value right so that means here"
5762800,5766560," i can use something like it"
5766560,5768560," index"
5768560,5771520," and then i can just use it like that"
5771520,5774640," do you know what i mean we can actually call it something like target"
5774640,5778720," and index so the target is this"
5784240,5786000," and index is this so"
5786000,5788960," this is basically how i approach that right"
5788960,5792560," uh so there is it index right"
5792560,5796800," oh okay so that means it's i didn't i didn't even have to do that okay thank you"
5796800,5798000," all right"
5798000,5801440," index"
5801440,5802880," oh okay"
5802880,5810720," whatever all right so this is basically how we're going to signal uh the fact that you know"
5812240,5818320," we collided with something border bar target or no collision whatsoever"
5818320,5828400," and then whoever calls this function right for any reason should decide what they want to do with"
5828400,5835920," that information you see what i mean right so if we're using that to resolve the collision for the"
5835920,5840320," projectile we want to emit particles if we're going to use that for particles we don't want to emit"
5840320,5846240," particles in fact for particles we don't even care what we hit we just hit something right so and"
5846240,5851040," this becomes more and more abstract right so this entire thing becomes more and more abstract"
5851040,5861120," okay so here uh we have a projectile rect and i suppose how do we construct the rect do we have"
5862000,5870480," just a rect uh just a rect aha i see so what i'm thinking is that i want to create a rect uh function"
5870480,5879520," just construct a rect um can i do x y w h float 32 and then return the rect and then do something like"
5880320,5897200," uh result uh result uh result a rect uh result x equal x y w h and then you just return this into i think"
5897200,5905040," so this is the result uh horse collision okay so here what we have to do we have to take correct"
5905680,5918240," um x um x y w h so this is a rectangle we check that we intersect and in that case we update the"
5918240,5925040," horizontal velocity right we update the horizontal velocity and also signal what happened uh target pool"
5926640,5937600," okay um"
5937600,5942560," okay why are you passing parameters as pointers well"
5942560,5948720," already answered in the chat thank you thank you so much for answering all right so here is another"
5950560,5957840," oh this one is weird i suppose to actually not use x and y in here because i updated"
5957840,5968000," i think i updated x so that means i have to use an x in here yeah and in here i also have to use an x"
5968000,5975840," and then the reference y uh right right right so i think that's how it's gonna work right"
5977440,5984240," then oh here's the interesting thing uh signaling this kind of stuff right that you hit target actually"
5984240,5992480," enables us to um fact like decouple the target hit function as well so this target hit could be called"
5992480,5999600," by whoever calls this function right so we can actually do something like that uh and then uh we're"
5999600,6007520," we're gonna do it like this there we go so i think this made the entire code a little bit simpler"
6007520,6012640," right so we decouple it from a lot of things and it became simpler so now it is"
6012640,6017040," purely a logic right it's a period of logic of how we do collision"
6017040,6022720," um so junior freotus i hope i'm pronouncing them correctly thank you so much for twitch prime thank you"
6022720,6029440," thank you thank you thank you okay so that's pretty cool and essentially we want to do uh the same thing"
6029440,6031520," for vertical collision right"
6031520,6044880," so i'm just thinking did they forget anything else i think that's fine so yeah this has to be"
6046880,6052640," something like this uh something like this so this is just a like a rectangle i could have just saved"
6052640,6059040," that rectangle somewhere now you're sub yes yes yes yes yes yes okay freaking this"
6059040,6066800," uh the signature of the vert collision should be the same as the horizontal collision so this is going to be"
6067600,6082000," vert right it's the same uh here we have y this is y this has to be a speed uh dy and dt so then this is dy and y"
6082000,6094960," w windows height so we also remove that that is not new anymore uh overlaps this one is kind of similar to"
6094960,6106960," this except now since we modified y we have to do this and and y uh we don't have to do that bar dx um"
6106960,6118880," oh yeah so the collision the collision system also enables you with redirecting whatever you hit with"
6118880,6124000," the bar right the bar can redirect things and if we're going to be reusing this collision for the particles"
6124000,6128640," that means it's going to affect the particles as well you know how projectile can be redirected by the"
6128640,6133360," by the bar imagine that you can do the same with particles"
6133360,6139040," that is a very interesting idea right"
6139040,6145600," that is actually pretty cool it's gonna it's gonna work intrinsically right so we won't have"
6145600,6151040," to do anything because we we're using the same collision system uh so that's what makes it cool"
6152240,6160880," we'll see how it works so bell durand uh four uh to eight thank you so much um okay we'll see how it"
6160880,6167520," works so maybe if we want to want this thing to actually have any effect maybe we will have to"
6167520,6172640," extend its life so the particles can oh that's so cool actually"
6175040,6180960," because you generate particles when the projectile hits the bar that means there will be enough particle"
6180960,6186480," near the bar to actually make it visible holy i want to finish this thing okay i'm sorry"
6186480,6193600," uh i'm just this is just like a hypothesis but we'll see how it goes um all right so if it's not dead"
6197280,6202160," and especially like that it just makes the code simpler i i like everything that makes the code"
6202160,6212640," simpler uh i really like that so this is why uh this is y and y and then return no uh so in here we"
6212640,6219840," just have um border right so this is the border this is the bar and this is the target"
6219840,6224640," plus it index"
6224640,6234400," i mean it's it's it's a mistake but i mean the compiler will tell me anyway"
6235280,6242720," we also have an interesting thing called bar collision and the bar collision is specifically"
6242720,6246560," only for projectile and it kind of prevents the projectile"
6246560,6252080," from penetrating the ball"
6252080,6262560," and i wonder if we want to migrate this thing for particles as well i'm not sure actually i'll have to"
6262560,6268480," think about that okay so i already made enough uh changes right so i already made enough changes in"
6268480,6274160," here now i need to see uh if this entire thing compiles so as you can see this entire thing does not"
6274160,6281600," even compile yet uh okay you can't do it like that okay really"
6281600,6285360," that's actually kind of strange"
6285360,6292320," okay i'm actually kind of surprised that you can't do that by the way if how do you specify"
6293040,6294400," the type for enumeration"
6294400,6297840," i don't quite remember"
6297840,6310720," well that's how we do it i mean ah am i being dumb yes i am being dumb i'm sorry"
6310720,6316720," okay there we go so luckily compiler always tells me if i'm doing something wrong"
6318080,6329040," all right okay uh target uh so it doesn't like type mismatch oh i see so now it cannot infer that thing"
6329040,6340480," so i have to specifically say collision dot targets right is that a problem no okay uh so type mismatch"
6343040,6349680," type collision type s64 can i just say s64 will it work"
6354640,6357760," mm-hmm so it's very strongly typed"
6357760,6366480," i wonder if i can do something like this and then something like this"
6366480,6373120," i can all right so it's not particularly convenient but i can do that all right"
6374080,6379360," so now we're using the horizontal collision so let me try to do this kind of thing"
6379360,6387280," of course collision so here we have to provide the position the position that we're going to provide"
6387280,6395200," is going to be the position of the projectiles so it's a approach x approach y right so something like this"
6395200,6398320," and here is the approach dx"
6398320,6408080," and approach dy so these are the pointers uh the width and height is the same it is literally the same"
6408080,6417200," so it's going to approach size and dt is the t dt that we love and know uh and here we've got the collision"
6417200,6427280," which we can probably check with a switch case so if we have a border right we're gonna in just emit some"
6427280,6433600," particles right if we got bar we've got bar we're gonna emit other particles if we got targets"
6435680,6438800," this one is rather strange"
6438800,6446480," uh i'm learning english watching you thank you very much you're welcome i'm not a really"
6446480,6449040," good english teacher especially with my pronunciation"
6449040,6456800," but i'm really glad it's useful just spam xx until it compiles all yeah exactly"
6456800,6462720," star gets an address like in c++ yeah"
6463280,6470080," it's basically the idea it kind of makes sense look to indicate that a type is a pointer you put"
6470080,6478240," a star right you put a star to indicate that a variable is a pointer that the value has to be"
6478240,6484960," a pointer you also put a star you use the same symbol to indicate that type is a pointer and to take"
6484960,6492720," a pointer to a value it makes sense it's in c++ the decisions of the operators don't make sense enjoy it"
6492720,6499840," make sense right and that's why it's easy to remember enjoy right the dereferencing actually kind of weird"
6499840,6501840," but maybe there is a reason behind it as well"
6501840,6508800," um okay so here we're gonna do something like this if case um"
6512800,6519840," i wonder can i use like it is there any magical variable for the switch cases"
6519840,6526960," i wonder is there any magical variable for the switch cases to refer to the value in here"
6526960,6535840," does anyone know that would be kind of cool like if i put it in here it refers to the value in here"
6537040,6538560," gi developers does anyone know"
6538560,6544400," that would be actually kind of cool because i want to just check something here maybe i'm doing"
6544400,6549920," something wrong right again but i'm learning the language because one of the things i want to do i"
6549920,6557120," actually i want to just check if it it it is greater or equal to something like uh target"
6557120,6567600," i don't think so but it would be super cool uh try it oh yeah we can try that right so because this is"
6567600,6573600," what i want to do right because there's also a case for no which also means"
6573600,6577920," well i still need it right"
6580320,6587360," it will be cool but uh because a lot of shadowing with four loops i imagine maybe i don't know okay"
6587360,6591360," so let me actually just try to compile that maybe the compiler will tell me something useful"
6591360,6598240," uh target okay it's a similar thing so it's a collision and then we spam xx"
6598240,6605040," i feel like i'm doing something wrong with enumeration so that's the problem so i i it is not"
6605040,6610160," defined okay so that essentially means that i have to save it somewhere so horse"
6610160,6620640," maybe hz hc so and hc is the border bar and then hc is greater than that all right so and what do we"
6620640,6629920," have in here uh what else do we have in here okay i think that it worked all right so that's what i"
6629920,6639840," wanted to have so for the border uh horse collision particle emit let's emit some particles right"
6640720,6647280," for the border we're gonna do that so this is the position"
6647280,6655520," right then we use the color and then the particle emitter all right do we need anything else i don't"
6655520,6664480," think so actually so for the bar the only difference here is just the bar color for the target for the"
6664480,6672240," target though it's going to be target heat and we just take the target pool uh targets pool and we"
6672240,6677120," take hc uh minus target"
6677120,6684880," and let's see if it's going to work i have a strange feeling that it may not work"
6685440,6691920," semicolon expected sure so let's put semicolon the columns in here okay"
6691920,6697280," all right and it didn't work"
6700320,6713040," collision uh uh target oh maybe because of that it didn't work properly uh mismatched type level"
6713040,6721120," and direction it's a pointer let's take a pointer okay i'm surprised this shit worked all right uh"
6721760,6726720," that's actually pretty cool that is actually very very much cool"
6726720,6734560," you know what the thing here is that this code"
6735360,6741440," is also applicable to here which means that i can have a function that accepts a collision"
6741440,6748960," right so just a collision and just does all of that for you"
6751040,6760960," right so we can specifically we can call it uh handle approach collision right so it's gonna be just that"
6760960,6762960," and uh yeah"
6762960,6777280," which also means i can just take this stuff and say handle approach collision this and then handle approach"
6777280,6784800," collision this where you i call this thing with the same arguments there you go it's the same code it's"
6784800,6791680," handled the same all right and what's interesting is that this is literally the thing that i"
6791680,6797920," basically factored out from the horizontal collision and vertical collision right so this is basically"
6797920,6805360," the code that got removed from from these things that's actually pretty cool uh okay so everything more"
6805360,6810320," or less decoupled now um okay so this has to be called c"
6810320,6814640," and does it work"
6814640,6820080," okay um it's pretty cool"
6820080,6828320," of course of course it didn't work first try i mean what did they expect um okay"
6831120,6838640," uh i wonder why so nothing got updated at all"
6838640,6843840," even though yeah"
6843840,6850160," should a bar x be bar y probably"
6851600,6860880," shiit"
6860880,6864800," where is bar x"
6864800,6876880," no not really it has to be bar x it's specifically bar uh x yeah so everything fine"
6878320,6883760," oh it was moves thank you thank you so much yes i know now i know what the hell is going on yeah yeah"
6883760,6889840," because dx and dy approach dx and dy were actually zero and one"
6889840,6898240," zero and one because they indicated a direction but then i changed them into absolute value of the velocity"
6898240,6904080," and i forgot about that thank you right so uh now essentially"
6904080,6907520," so they are initialized with"
6907520,6909360," just"
6909360,6913200," zero zero uh horse"
6913200,6920240," collision so here i just multiplied by minus one which is fine which is precisely what i want so nothing"
6920240,6928560," special is needed in here uh approach dx okay i initialized them with uh that i'm going to initialize"
6928560,6932800," them with zero at least for now and now"
6932800,6940080," yeah so what i need to do in here is actually approach speed"
6940080,6950000," uh approach speed yeah i forgot that i actually changed the measure units for the for the speed of this"
6950240,6955200," thing"
6955200,6956080," all right"
6956080,6960800," is it was it actually speed"
6960800,6964480," i feel like it was"
6964480,6973760," which begs the question did i type this size oh yeah all right"
6975360,6978960," okay so i'm already getting tired so as you can see i'm making a lot of mistakes"
6978960,6980880," yeah that's cool"
6980880,6990400," all right so and for why uh we have to do approach uh speed"
6990400,6994800," why to redirect it vertically"
6997120,7005680," uh"
7005680,7011360," maybe it has to be negative"
7011360,7015120," i think it has to be negative"
7015120,7022240," yeah finally finally it works okay"
7023920,7026480," i refactored the whole collision system"
7026480,7031120," and i didn't break things um"
7031120,7035600," so now i think there is still a little bit of a bug"
7035600,7038960," so horizontal vertical collision"
7038960,7047120," aha so this bar dx i think bar dx is still in those measure units or something like that"
7048000,7050000," right so i initially"
7050000,7056160," what do i set it to yeah yeah yeah so i set it to one so that means this entire thing has to be"
7056160,7059200," uh multiplied by the approach speed"
7065200,7066320," actually no"
7066320,7066400," actually no"
7066400,7069760," it has to be okay"
7069760,7078240," you need to take project dx and multiply it by absolute value projects okay so i think that's what"
7078240,7082240," needs to be happening uh when we are redirecting things"
7082240,7087760," all right okay so that works okay so that's cool"
7094720,7097280," now the moment of truth"
7097280,7106000," the moment of truth we need to apply the collision the collision system"
7106000,7113200," uh 224 uh yep thank you thank you so much"
7115440,7119920," uh"
7119920,7128960," okay uh now the moment of truth we need to apply that to the particles"
7128960,7137200," update update update update update a bit all right so here we update the particles themselves"
7138720,7143200," you see you see so uh let's take the horse"
7143200,7144640," collision"
7144640,7149680," so here we do"
7149680,7152080," eat"
7152080,7154960," x"
7154960,7164640," eat"
7164640,7164960," y"
7164960,7166960," eat"
7166960,7167360," dicks"
7167360,7168720," i'm sorry"
7168720,7169760," okay"
7169760,7170800," um"
7170800,7179200," yeah i'm i'm 13 i'm sorry so and the size of the center i think is going to be so what's the size of the"
7179200,7184800," the particle do we have the size of the particle we only have the um"
7184800,7188560," um"
7188560,7194880," so in the render when we render the thing"
7195440,7196400," um"
7196400,7201760," um the size is actually this right so the size is actually this"
7201760,7209200," oh shit um so maybe i'm gonna not use the center yeah i'm not gonna use the center"
7209200,7212880," because it will complicate the thing a little bit"
7214480,7218320," so here's the actual size uh this one is gonna be"
7218320,7226320," this so this is the size then dt and we don't have to do that but we also have to do the vertical"
7226320,7227280," collision as well"
7227280,7229040," all right"
7229040,7230960," that should be it"
7230960,7232960," believe it or not"
7232960,7233440," uh"
7233440,7236400," really was thank you so much for for prime thank you thank you thank you"
7239200,7239600," all right"
7239600,7241520," so"
7241520,7245520," that's pretty cool"
7245520,7251040," so i'm gonna just try to build the thing and see if it works or not okay so i forgot to"
7251040,7255600," essentially do something like this"
7260720,7261120," okay"
7261120,7268400," we're using collision detection for the particles as well and uh this entire thing compiles"
7268400,7270800," which is cool right"
7270800,7277120," the moment of truth i'm about to run the game and see how it works"
7284560,7284880," well"
7284880,7290160," holy"
7290160,7295360," okay"
7295360,7296320," so"
7296320,7300560," interesting thing i think i know why this happens"
7300560,7308880," the reason why this happens is because we do not ignore we do not ignore the dead particles"
7310400,7310640," right"
7310640,7316960," so what we need to do is just check the lifetime we're only going to care about the particles"
7316960,7321120," that have lifetime greater than zero because essentially we have thousands of particles"
7321120,7328720," right and on each frame we iterate a thousand times and for each particle we also check all of"
7328720,7333280," the targets and there is i don't know like you've seen how many targets we have right"
7333280,7337360," so if i take a look at the parameters right um"
7338160,7345280," target rows we have 100 particles right so essentially we do 10 000 of iterations each frame"
7345280,7351920," uh right 10 000 of iterations to each frame which is not particularly great so i want this kind of"
7351920,7358080," stuff to actually you know be fast if we don't have that many particles"
7358080,7363840," uh is this on github i haven't finished writing the code yet"
7364880,7370160," people just just a second i'm gonna finish it and i publish it on on github"
7370160,7380640," oh can you see that can you see how they interact can you see how the i'm not sure if"
7380640,7386320," it's even visible but i think it's kind of visible i think it is holy this is so cool"
7390400,7392320," yeah you can see how they interact"
7392320,7404400," oh i'm not sure if thousands of particles is a good idea"
7404400,7412400," what about this amount of particles right so this it will make it generally faster"
7414960,7420560," i think i think i think it will make it generally faster because i don't think we generate that many"
7420560,7423920," particles simultaneously yeah"
7426240,7434720," that's that's that's very cool"
7450640,7459600," yeah i did it and now we even have more general generalized uh collision detection mechanism which is"
7459600,7465040," extremely cool"
7465040,7473040," um"
7477520,7485040," all right so let's do a committee committee"
7485040,7490720," the ball bounced off the particle did it i didn't see that"
7490720,7495760," really it shouldn't like in in no way it should actually do that"
7495760,7502720," um maybe it's a some kind of a different book"
7504720,7508080," um because we don't really check for for particles"
7508080,7514960," it definitely bounced me there well maybe it's a bug with uh colliding with bar"
7514960,7520000," so but that's a completely different thing uh emitter period"
7520000,7525120," emitter lifetime so what if i actually"
7525120,7530960," make it a bit faster i wonder that's a good idea"
7534720,7537200," what if it's a good idea okay"
7537200,7544000," okay so now we're generating more particles"
7544000,7547920," is that a good idea probably"
7547920,7555440," another thing i have uh in mind is maybe speed up"
7555440,7564560," a little bit i think"
7564560,7573200," oh i suppose you can play with different parameters for the particles but it's actually kind of fun"
7577520,7579920," i don't know where you guys see that honestly"
7579920,7588080," oh okay so but it's not it's not from the particle okay i see yeah"
7588080,7593680," yeah it's it's from the bar it's it's a bug from the bar"
7593680,7595120," yeah"
7597360,7611360," so it's it's a bar collision thing yeah there we go that's a very interesting mechanic if you know what i mean"
7611360,7616640," i really like this mechanic actually"
7622720,7623440," so let me see"
7623440,7629520," it just follows the bar that's what's happening so it means"
7629520,7632800," bar x"
7632800,7637760," handle and"
7637760,7645280," approach collision so this is basically what's happening in here right and"
7645280,7651120," this is what we do in here"
7652720,7656400," yeah"
7656400,7663600," so this thing only should only happen on i think vertical position right but for now"
7663600,7667200," i mean i can just disable that oh my god emacs what the hell"
7667200,7673280," and say are you serious"
7679600,7686160," yeah yeah yeah so i can fix that a little bit later so i don't know what exactly causes that but"
7686160,7692560," there's something wrong with detecting bar collision in some of those things right so horse"
7692560,7697600," collision so we do that so this bar x and then we"
7697600,7702640," do that and we report that we hit that for the vertical collision"
7705120,7705680," you know what"
7705680,7716160," yeah it has to be bar x it it has to be because we're constructing a rectangle based on its x"
7716160,7720160," so i i'll see what i can do in here at some point"
7722560,7731760," okay okay so let me uh go there handle"
7731760,7740080," fix bar uh redirection mechanics right"
7745440,7750320," all right i suppose that's basically everything that i wanted to do today right so i wanted to"
7750320,7756000," implement a particle system and we actually implemented a pretty awesome particle system that"
7756000,7763440," interacts with with the environment i really like that i think that's actually pretty cool"
7764000,7768400," and the cool thing is that it uses the same mechanism right so that's what makes it cool"
7768400,7772640," it uses the same mechanism so it interacts with the environment the same way as the ball"
7772640,7779520," uh oh and by the way since yeah since we don't detect the the bar stuff"
7779520,7783920," it kind of gets weird but i'm gonna fix that a little bit later right so"
7788560,7795600," hmm it's kind of interesting maybe it's not a bad idea you know what i mean what if we actually only"
7795600,7805600," play the particles on on targets why not how about that so we only play on targets right everything"
7805600,7811920," else it doesn't matter it's not a bad idea i think i'm gonna do it as it is because when it"
7811920,7817520," place particles on everything it kind of gets too noisy you know what i mean"
7817520,7829120," um did you read or watch something in particle collision no i never watched anything the only"
7829120,7835840," thing i know about particles is that uh particle system have have things called particle emitter"
7835840,7838880," so that's the only thing i know about particle systems"
7840240,7846720," right because i heard game developers throw around uh terms like particle and particle emitter"
7846720,7851600," so that's everything i know and i thought that maybe i'm gonna call one of my things that i"
7851600,7855920," have in the game also particle meter because it makes sense to call it like that apart from that"
7855920,7860240," i don't really know anything about particular music again i'm not a game developer i'm just a"
7860240,7866240," software developer i approach developing a game the same way as i approach developing any software"
7866240,7872960," right so i basically try to formalize the the problem and then once i formalize the problem i"
7872960,7878160," try to solve it knowing the methods uh using the methods that i know so that's everything and that's"
7878160,7883840," how i came up with this system is that a wrong approach i don't know so it works it kind of does the"
7883840,7891280," think i think i wanted to do um collision don't really know much about collision um"
7891280,7901040," so the collision uh system that i have in here i invented myself uh by trial and error"
7901040,7909760," it's actually very simple collision system it's extremely system it's extremely simple uh and that's why"
7909760,7915840," why it's so robust by the way so i can even even demonstrate you how about how robust it is"
7915840,7920560," because one of the problems that you encounter when you try to implement a breakout or ping pong"
7920560,7925760," or stuff like that is that your bar may start penetrating the ball and it's kind of difficult"
7925760,7933120," to get rid of that so uh my collision system does not do that so maybe particle can penetrate the ball but"
7933120,7941040," the uh the the maybe particles can penetrate the bar but the ball won't be able to do that so if i take"
7941040,7948240," the bar uh bar thickness i'm going to set the bar thickness to 100 right so as you can see here is the"
7948240,7958400," bar thickness uh and i'm going to show you so it won't ever intersect with it so you can't do that so"
7958400,7965520," one of the ways i solve that is that when the bar is about to penetrate the ball the bar is stopped so"
7965520,7969280," as you can see it's sort of like stuttering it so that's how i achieve that"
7969280,7978560," so this is a very thick bar so you can't see everything but maybe i can do uh some things for"
7978560,7983360," for example i can just take the camera and put it somewhere here so you can see everything because i"
7983360,7991200," want to show something interesting uh just a second so for instance i can actually"
7991200,8000320," pull it really near to the border and it will still not penetrate uh so i just i'm kind of trying to to"
8000320,8005120," reach that point where it will be very close that's kind of difficult"
8007520,8012160," uh this abb collagen detection yeah it's a very simple one"
8012160,8023280," maybe you should make the size of the screen a little bit smaller because it's kind of okay"
8023280,8028560," yeah as you can see it still didn't penetrate so i actually like press it against the wall"
8029440,8031280," and it still couldn't penetrate it so"
8031280,8036960," there we go pretty cool"
8036960,8049840," so all right uh let me see let me see let me see let me actually bring it back to 20."
8051520,8059760," uh no penetration yes bam bam all right bam"
8059760,8068800," and now um yeah let's do a committee committee and maybe even a pushy pushing"
8075360,8083280," implement collision detection for particles right i'm gonna push that right into the report"
8083280,8091760," so in the worst case scenario right we're gonna have 128 by 128"
8091760,8100320," no really 128 particles and then 100 targets right so"
8101920,8109440," and 28 particles and 100 targets so in the worst case scenario we're gonna have 10 000 iterations per"
8109440,8115520," frame but that will only happen if we saturate all of the particles simultaneously and that is not"
8115520,8124320," gonna even last for too long uh right so essentially we can get away with linear algorithms as long as we"
8124320,8131680," actually keep the capacity of these things small so it may become a problem when we start increasing the"
8131680,8140480," amount of targets right it may become a problem um but in that case i think i would start to actually"
8140480,8147520," use some special spatial trees for checking the collision with the targets you know what i mean"
8147520,8151840," so if we're gonna have a lot of these targets right i better build like some sort of a kd tree"
8151840,8159360," right and check it for that and that way i could probably reduce it to log uh right so it's gonna be"
8160560,8169440," log uh and that is gonna be a thousand right um something like that that's basically the idea and"
8169440,8175520," since the targets are static right they're static uh i can just build like quite easily like a static"
8175520,8177280," okay the key tree and it's gonna work"
8177280,8193520," since so many ask about better can i link to a section of uh today's stream by john explaining yeah of course"
8193520,8202800," you can you're a sub so that means you can just do that uh so any sub can post any links in the chat"
8204160,8210720," uh so should i play it should we listen to john i think we should and the problem is that uh twitch is"
8210720,8219040," really slow for me so let me pause the music and we're gonna open and listen to the message from"
8219040,8227920," jonathan blue himself everyone can download some ram nowadays uh it's all right well i can't download any ram"
8228960,8239120," it's under sanctions and uh so this is twitch in 2022"
8242560,8265600," okay okay yeah i mean basically in the closed beta right now i just decide who gets in and what how do i do that it's pretty simple"
8267200,8271920," i just say is this likely to be a person who's a relatively advanced programmer"
8271920,8277600," uh maybe we should just let it buffer a little bit i'm sorry"
8277600,8284080," like they're not going to be writing hello world and are they probably actually going to use it"
8286400,8293040," and probably actually gonna you know put it through its paces and help actually test it and"
8293040,8300000," engage in the community and you know help people think about how to make things in this language right"
8300000,8304880," basically i don't want to add a bunch of people who like want to be on the beta for prestige"
8306480,8311200," and like don't really use it and like don't want to add a bunch of people who like don't really know how to program"
8311200,8315360," fuck i don't fit to that description"
8315360,8319680," fuck how did i get into better"
8319680,8324800," that's that's the decision making process"
8325840,8332160," shit okay i probably have to implement something like more complicated than this game"
8332160,8338400," i mean is it more complicated than hello world i don't know the problem is that"
8338400,8345760," john is such an experienced game developer that this kind of thing for him is probably hello world"
8346720,8348640," so i i don't know"
8348640,8354160," i'll try to develop something more complicated maybe at some point"
8354160,8363360," uh i'll try i'll try well i reported some bug like usability bug about the error message and stuff"
8363360,8370400," like that and i also stream uh right so i also help to popularize the the language and also explain how"
8370400,8375520," it works for people who can eventually get to the better maybe i am contributing to the community by my"
8375520,8379360," streams i don't know you guys tell me but i don't know i feel like a fraud right now"
8379360,8386960," and so the the invaders was his hello world real and true yeah so"
8386960,8390080," i need to develop something more complicated"
8390080,8401920," all right so i guess that's it for today thanks everyone who's watching right now i really appreciate"
8401920,8407600," it have a good one and i see you uh next time i see you next time uh love you"
8407600,8412880," you"
