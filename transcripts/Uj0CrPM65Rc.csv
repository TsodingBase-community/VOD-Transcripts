960,6960," Hello and welcome to another setting session. How about that? How about that?"
6960,9940," Hello, JourneyMost. Hello, hello. Welcome, welcome, welcome."
9940,18960," So today is Monday and today I wanted to continue to work on my immediate terminal UI experiments"
18960,22960," in the form of an interactive terminal to do app."
22960,27900," So yeah, so today I wanted to continue developing the terminal to do app in Rust"
28180,32760," and you can find the source code of this thing in the description if you're interested in this thing."
32760,34840," So this is going to be source code."
34840,39700," And the previous episode of this series was on YouTube."
39700,41520," Simon, hi. Hi, Simon. How are you doing?"
41520,50460," So let's actually go to Serging Daily and let's find the previous episode."
50460,54880," Let's see if we can spot... I can already see the previous episode. Here it is."
54880,60540," So in the previous episode, we implemented two-panel interface for the application."
60540,63360," And let me demonstrate you."
63360,67240," So previous episode is going to be located in here."
67240,69540," So I think I already fetched everything."
69540,72240," So let's see, let's see, let's see."
74020,79480," So if I run the center, I think so it also requires the file into which it stores everything."
79480,82360," And as you can see here is the two-panel interface."
82360,85760," So maybe it would make sense to actually reset everything hard."
85760,88480," And yeah, there we go."
88480,91840," So here you can basically mark something as done."
91840,96500," Or if you're unsure, you can actually go in here and mark something as not really done."
96660,101720," Right. So as you can see, you have two-panel interface and you can switch between the two panels."
101720,105400," So that's what we implemented in the previous stream."
105400,117900," So today I wanted to do something interesting and I wanted to implement the ability to add new items to the to-do list and also edit the items."
117900,126080," So I think I want to start with editing the finals, the items, because that will make adding new items trivial."
126080,126700," Right."
126700,132040," So as soon as you can edit the current item, for instance, I didn't want to start Emacs."
132040,132740," Just a second."
132740,134040," Right."
134040,136920," So for instance, I can edit something by pressing some key."
136920,145920," The implementation of adding a new thing would be essentially adding an empty item and switching to editing of that item."
146180,152120," So, yeah, I think editing items has priority over adding them."
152120,155500," So that's precisely what we're going to do right now."
155500,161000," So hello, everyone who just joined."
161000,164920," Welcome, welcome, welcome."
164920,165940," Is this a Rust channel?"
165940,166720," No, no."
166720,170980," Yesterday we did C++ and the day before that we did something else."
170980,173400," You just don't watch this channel unless I'm doing Rust."
173400,175220," So that's why you're being biased about that."
176180,179680," So it's actually very interesting."
179680,184980," Like people tend to be extremely biased towards what they like."
184980,185600," Right."
185600,190800," So, for instance, there's a huge portion of people who never watch me unless I do C."
190800,191480," Right."
191480,194960," And there's also a portion of people who never watch me unless I do JavaScript."
194960,200000," Or there's a portion of people like you who never watch me unless I do Rust."
200340,202100," So, for you, I'm a Rust developer."
202100,203880," For other people, I'm a C developer."
203880,204240," Right."
204240,210460," And, like, you know, for different people, whatever fits their agenda, I'm that developer."
210460,212780," So, no, this is not a Rust channel."
212780,214660," It's just like you watch me only when I do Rust."
218720,219320," All right."
219320,220520," So, let's continue."
220520,222640," What I wanted to do here."
222640,237220," So, let's create a separate branch for this entire thing."
237480,240520," And let's see how we're going to approach this stuff."
240520,248160," So, I suppose, like, I think I wanted to introduce a special mode, like editing mode."
248160,256680," Maybe not even an editing mode, but rather like a boolean, sort of speak, like editing."
256680,257520," Right."
258000,265220," So, initially, we're not in the editing mode, but then by pressing a specific key, you switch to the editing mode."
265220,275060," And while sort of handling a specific list, if you're in editing mode, you're going to be editing the one that is currently selected in there."
276360,285360," So, but I think it's going to be rather difficult because, as you can see, we're handling the keys from the user input."
285360,296320," And if you are in the editing mode, these keys has to be redirected to the sort of, like, the editor that's going to be activated when you are in the editor mode."
297000,308420," So, I think I want to do a rather interesting thing or sort of, like, more in the immediate UI style thing."
308420,314160," Again, for those who doesn't know what is immediate UI, it's something similar to IAM GUI."
314160,314980," Right."
314980,321680," So, if you worked with IAM GUI, that's essentially what we're trying to implement, but for the terminal in the Rust."
322000,327360," So, I'm going to put this thing in the chat and in the description as well."
327360,328780," Right."
328780,331200," So, IAM GUI."
331200,332060," Right."
332060,341040," So, but the interesting thing about terminal is that in the terminal, you cannot use the same approaches as in graphics."
341040,341400," Right."
341400,343960," So, the approach of IAM GUI doesn't really work there."
343960,346640," So, we sort of have to reinvent our own approach."
346820,354760," And to know what's the approach is used by IAM GUI, I really recommend to watch the cases moratory talk on immediate UIs."
354760,361540," So, I'm going to give the link to that talk in the chat and also in the description if you're interested in this kind of stuff."
361540,365400," So, here is the talk and I'm going to put it in the description."
365400,368800," So, it's a cases moratory talk on immediate mode UIs."
368800,370320," It's a very interesting talk."
370320,376440," It's like 40 minutes long, but it explains the concept of immediate UI really well."
376440,383880," So, the main idea is that you have sort of like hot widgets and active widgets."
384380,389240," But what's interesting is that this idea of hot and active widgets doesn't really work in a terminal."
389240,397480," So, the only place it works at is when you have a mouse cursor and you can instantly focus on anything on the screen."
397480,402060," Here, you cannot easily instantly focus on anything on the screen."
402240,408180," So, you have to sort of like, I don't know, navigate through the widgets, right?"
408180,409880," And some of the widgets are navigatable."
409880,411260," Some of them are not navigatable."
411260,416220," For instance, I have to navigate to a corresponding panel."
416220,421080," And then when I have editing mode, I have to enter into editing mode."
421080,424840," But I actually entered editing mode inside of the left panel."
425260,426820," But what if I'm on the right panel?"
426820,429180," What if I want to edit something on the right panel?"
429180,432060," So, as you can see, I have an editing mode on the left panel."
432060,434100," And I have an editing mode on the right panel."
434100,438080," So, there's a lot of combinatorial complexity here, like, in place."
438080,442440," And you sort of need some sort of like a stack of the active items."
442440,447280," And as you navigate further down in the tree, you sort of grow that stack or something like that."
447280,449540," At least that's what it starts to feel like."
449700,458540," And because of that, the original approach that Casey Motory explained in his talk is not really applicable to the terminal UIs."
458540,461200," But maybe terminal UIs is a completely different beast."
461200,462820," So, I don't know."
462820,464800," It is what it is."
464800,466880," And that's precisely what I'm trying to explore in here."
466880,472520," I'm trying to explore how to apply the immediate UI ideas to the terminal, right?"
472520,473960," To the terminal."
475580,481060," So, for those who are wondering what I'm doing, so, I don't know for how long you've been watching me."
481060,484760," But for people like you, I have a command called project."
484760,487140," Or you can do a today command."
487140,490540," And it will give you a brief description of what precisely we're doing."
490540,493400," And a link to the source code of the projects we're working on."
493400,495100," There's no need to ask me that."
495100,497320," Just do a today command or project command."
497320,500380," And you'll get the link to the project that we're currently working on."
500380,501940," Hello, everyone."
501940,502740," Hello, Rotten Transfer."
502740,503640," Hello, Hurts and Pots."
503640,504160," Hello, hello."
504160,504920," How are you guys doing?"
504920,506020," Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome."
506020,511600," So, will you redraw the entire UI every frame?"
511600,514460," Believe it or not, I already do."
514460,521540," The entire UI right now, right here, is redrawn every frame."
521540,523040," It is."
523040,526900," This is precisely how it works right now."
526900,529600," I not just will, I already do."
533660,535680," Okay, 666, thank you so much for tier one subscription."
535680,536540," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
536540,539080," And welcome to our epic immediate UI club."
539080,541280," Troll Flix, hello."
541280,543200," So, hello, Jaxi."
543200,543500," Hello."
543500,543980," Thank you."
543980,545560," Thank you so much for this subscription."
546920,547540," All right."
547540,553340," So, one of the things I want to do, I want to slightly refactor the way we handle the input of the user."
553340,556700," So, let me see how we're going to do that."
556700,565240," So, I suppose I'm going to remove this entire thing."
565240,577780," So, as you can see here, we are handling the key, right?"
577780,588120," And then we have a huge dispatch between different keys and depending on the current mode, we basically modify the state of a particular widget."
588480,591740," So, I think this is not particularly great for what we're trying to do."
591740,597580," I think this kind of input handling has to be done in place of rendering."
597580,605040," So, you see, I'm still trying to separate sort of rendering of the UI and updating the state of the UI."
605040,608920," But, in fact, in case of immediate UI, it has to happen at the same place."
608920,614280," And that's why it's kind of difficult for me to introduce editing mode, right?"
614280,617320," Because these kind of things are not inseparable."
617320,619040," So, I have an idea."
619040,624800," We're going to have a special variable called key, right?"
624800,627780," So, here's a special variable called key."
627780,630860," And by default, it doesn't have anything, right?"
630860,642300," And in here, instead of this huge switch case, when we get a key and it's not equal to error, we're going to be actually assigning that key to the current key."
642300,648160," Yeah, so I need to rename this entire thing to something else, I suppose."
648160,654800," So, I don't even know how to call that."
654800,657960," Maybe this one is going to be called key current, right?"
657960,662760," So, key current, and here we're going to do something like this."
662760,665120," Current is going to be some key."
665120,665800," There we go."
665800,668660," So, and this entire thing is going to go away."
668660,675400," At least it's going to be moved to corresponding places, right?"
675400,677060," It's going to be moved to corresponding places."
681500,685860," So, for instance, before trying to handle anything, right?"
685860,700500," We can do something like if something like some key current is equal to Q, right?"
700500,704480," If it's equal to Q, we'll have to quit, right?"
704500,711900," So, I'm going to instantaneously, like, set Q to true and maybe also clear the entire thing."
711900,712700," But maybe not."
712700,716680," It actually depends on whether we are in the editing mode or not in the editing mode."
716680,719480," But since we didn't introduce the editing mode yet, it doesn't really matter."
719480,721040," Right."
721280,725800," So, and because of that, I want to actually map this entire thing to something like this."
725800,728780," So, as you ate as character."
728780,730300," And then we're going to compare it to Q."
730300,737460," And then, so basically, handling the key at a particular place essentially consumes the key, right?"
737460,739600," So, and after that, I want to just set it to none, right?"
739960,746220," See, if a particular place consumed the key, the next place down the road cannot consume it anymore."
746220,749820," So, whoever consumed it first gets to consume it, right?"
749820,752500," So, yeah, that's basically what we have in here."
761720,762380," All right."
762380,764900," So, that's what we're doing in here."
764900,770120," So, this is going to be cargo build."
770120,774960," Hello, deadmarshall, opt-in, priceless talk."
774960,775800," Hello, hello, everyone."
775800,776380," How are you guys doing?"
776380,777560," All right."
777560,781100," So, this entire thing seems to be compiling and let's try to run it."
781100,787280," And right now, I cannot control thing anymore because I just removed that huge switch case."
787280,788580," But I should be able to do Q."
788580,791580," And I can't Q anymore."
792720,793560," I wonder why, though."
793560,794520," I wonder why."
794520,803300," So, if it's not equal to that, I set this thing to current Q."
803300,808140," But it didn't handle anything anywhere, which is rather strange."
808140,816340," So, then it goes in there."
821300,830280," So, if I don't understand why it doesn't work."
830280,832060," So, does it even register anything?"
832060,837760," So, if I, for instance, register something in here, can I simply do something like to do?"
839760,840600," I think it's to do?"
840600,841160," I think it's to do?"
841160,841800," Push."
841800,844280," Format."
844280,848080," And we're going to set the key in here, right?"
848080,850340," So, we're going to have to take the pointer to this entire thing."
850340,853860," And let's rebuild this entire stuff and see how it goes."
854100,858220," So, this one has to be a string, right?"
858220,859560," Because it constructs a new string."
859560,860620," And, yeah."
860620,860860," Okay."
860860,864000," So, it sets the minus one in there."
867080,867620," Oh, yeah."
867620,868000," I'm an idiot."
868000,869760," You actually have to do that in here."
869760,870200," All right."
870200,870440," All right."
870440,870680," All right."
870680,872080," So, okay."
872080,873280," That makes sense."
873280,875100," Yeah."
875100,876540," So, I just need to focus."
876540,877860," I just need to focus on what I'm doing."
877860,879180," All right."
879180,880820," So, and I can quit everything."
880820,884680," And also, I need to actually get rid of this thing."
884680,886060," Yeah."
886060,887660," So, I cannot control anything."
887660,888900," But at least I can quit."
888900,889460," Right."
889460,889860," There we go."
889860,890320," That's perfect."
891000,899620," What's interesting is that at the end of the frame, at the end of the frame, if nobody consumed a key, maybe we can simply drop that key."
899620,900580," Right."
900580,902380," So, maybe we can simply drop that key."
902380,905380," So, we're going to set it to none."
905380,919060," Why Rust has this exclamation mark?"
919060,920680," They're macros, as far as I know."
921000,922800," Macros."
922800,926000," So, essentially, they're not functions, first of all."
926000,930560," They're something that expands to more code."
930560,939240," They're like, it's actually slightly incorrect to compare them to C macros because they expand on the level of AST."
939240,945720," C macros expand on the level of, some people would say, source code, which is technically correct."
945800,948140," But, in fact, it expands on the level of the tokens."
948140,948640," Right."
948640,950320," It's not just copy-pasting text."
950320,952860," It's on the level of specific tokens."
952860,953320," Right."
953320,954220," Right."
954220,956240," In case of Rust, I think it's on the level of AST."
956580,957420," So, it's not a function."
957420,961040," It expands according to particular macro rules."
961040,961460," Right."
961520,963320," So, it's not really a function."
971320,971640," All right."
971640,975380," So, we removed the key."
975380,976660," And, yeah."
976660,981660," As already mentioned, I think we need to start handling this kind of stuff in place."
981660,982280," Right."
982400,991480," So, essentially, if the current panel is to do, I'm going to render a panel in a particular fashion."
991480,996000," If it's not a current panel, I'm going to render it completely differently."
996000,1001060," So, I think this entire code in here, this chunk of code, has to be rewritten."
1001520,1005060," There will be a little bit of duplication between left panel and right panel."
1005060,1008360," But, that's precisely what I want to do."
1008360,1016440," I want to see the duplication, which will make it more obvious for us to how to compress that duplication and factor it out."
1016440,1017280," All right."
1017280,1029720," So, if the current panel is equal to status to do, right, we're going to be doing something like this."
1029800,1031760," I think I'm going to actually put this stuff like that."
1031760,1038420," So, first of all, I need to render UI label with a fixed width."
1038420,1041740," And, I want to render to do half of the screen."
1041740,1045000," And, I'm going to be highlighting that specific thing."
1045000,1045480," There we go."
1045480,1049480," So, basically, I'm moving these two conditions outside."
1049480,1050680," Right."
1050680,1052520," You see, this condition is inside of the call."
1052520,1054220," I want to sort of move it outside."
1054220,1056760," All right."
1056900,1060260," So, and then, I want to enumerate this entire thing."
1060260,1068680," So, I'm going to go into the index, to do, in to do's iterate, then enumerate."
1070980,1086320," And, in here, I'm simply, simply rendering a label fixed width, format, so, it's going to be to do, and half of the width."
1086320,1095120," And, we're going to use either regular or highlighted color, depending on what's the current index."
1095320,1096840," So, we're going to move it like this."
1096840,1107980," If index equal to the current index, right, if it's equal to the current index, we're going to be using the highlighted color."
1107980,1109980," Otherwise, we're going to use the regular color."
1109980,1111640," So, it's going to be a regular color."
1111640,1113360," Right."
1113360,1114180," There we go."
1114680,1116940," So, and that's pretty much it."
1116940,1119820," Otherwise, and here's the interesting part."
1119820,1122080," Otherwise, we're going to do pretty much the same."
1122080,1123720," I'm copy-pasting the code."
1123720,1126120," Absolutely fucking horrible."
1126120,1126760," I know."
1126760,1127620," Thank you very much."
1127620,1131440," So, I think I forgot to copy-paste this thing."
1131440,1134020," But, in here, we're going to be using the regular pair."
1134020,1134640," Right."
1134860,1139920," And, in here, we're always going to be using the regular pair, no matter what."
1139920,1141380," So, it's going to be a regular pair."
1141380,1144220," Why is it called regular pair?"
1144220,1145240," I don't know."
1145240,1147760," Okay."
1147760,1148960," So, yeah."
1148960,1149300," There we go."
1149300,1153060," So, this is basically what's happening when the to-do is active."
1153060,1157180," And, this is what happens when the to-do panel is inactive."
1157180,1157600," Right."
1162200,1162720," Okay."
1162720,1166720," So, and let's remove the rest of the stuff."
1166720,1172480," Let's remove the rest of the stuff."
1172480,1172860," All right."
1172860,1174540," So, here's the vertical one."
1174540,1175640," And, depending on the stuff."
1175640,1175840," Okay."
1175840,1176800," That's pretty cool."
1176800,1178940," That's pretty cool."
1178940,1179540," That's pretty cool."
1179540,1181180," Let's see if this entire stuff compiles."
1181180,1186400," So, maybe I'm going to actually put the space in here."
1186400,1188060," Okay."
1188060,1189780," So, none."
1189780,1193700," I expected I-32 because I have to set actually key current."
1193700,1196720," I have to say key current."
1196720,1197600," All right."
1197600,1208220," So, let's see if this entire thing works."
1208220,1208980," Okay."
1208980,1209940," So, it's still working."
1209940,1212940," As you can see, this thing is actually active."
1212940,1214080," And, I really like that."
1215320,1215700," All right."
1215700,1219540," So, we need to repeat the same process for the right panel."
1219540,1219940," Right."
1219940,1223800," So, might as well actually copy-paste this entire thing."
1223800,1224240," Right."
1224240,1225880," Let's just copy-paste this entire thing."
1225880,1227800," So, this is the right panel."
1227800,1232400," And, the thing about the right panel is that it just has done."
1232400,1234220," Instead of this thing."
1234220,1238380," This thing is essentially crossed out."
1238960,1241240," And, this one is done."
1241240,1242280," There we go."
1242280,1244700," So, yeah."
1244700,1246800," So, I really like how it looks like."
1246800,1248040," Look."
1248040,1250120," So, here is the whole UI."
1250120,1252580," This is how the whole UI looks like."
1252580,1253200," Right."
1253200,1254940," So, here is the left panel."
1254940,1256960," And, here is the right panel."
1256960,1260220," Here is how the panel looks like when it's activated."
1260220,1262880," Here is how it looks like when it's deactivated."
1262880,1265340," Here is how the right panel looks like when it's activated."
1265340,1268680," Here is how the left or right panel looks like when it's deactivated."
1268680,1272700," You see, it's actually like describing the UI tree."
1272700,1274780," But, directly in the code."
1274780,1277200," And, that code immediately renders it."
1277200,1278860," And, immediately handles it."
1278860,1281700," So, that's what makes this entire approach really, really interesting."
1281700,1287320," Because, you don't have a duplication between the code and the data."
1287320,1287620," Right."
1287620,1290500," Because, the code and the data become like sort of the one thing."
1290500,1293600," So, the code itself is the UI tree."
1294160,1295940," So, it's really, really interesting."
1295940,1298860," And, I wonder like why people don't use this kind of stuff more."
1298860,1299340," Right."
1299340,1300340," So, it's like."
1300340,1302040," But, to be fair."
1302040,1302920," In all fairness."
1302920,1304620," It's not really obvious approach."
1304620,1306600," It is really not obvious approach."
1306600,1307140," Because, the."
1307140,1309000," I don't know why, to be fair."
1309000,1309860," Why it is not obvious."
1309860,1310760," Maybe because of the."
1310760,1312700," How the programming is taught."
1312700,1314660," But, I don't know."
1314660,1317980," Do you plan to make that to do app work with apt install only?"
1317980,1321200," I don't plan to use this to do app for anything."
1321200,1322920," Please read the."
1322920,1323580," Read me."
1323580,1330200," This is meant to be an experimental playground for testing ideas for immediate Tui."
1330200,1331080," Right."
1331080,1333280," If you don't know what is immediate UI."
1333280,1334740," Check out."
1334740,1336300," First of all."
1336300,1336920," I am GUI."
1336920,1338980," I already explained it at the beginning of the stream."
1338980,1339480," Check out."
1339480,1340060," I am GUI."
1340220,1343160," And, check out cases moratorium talk on immediate UIs."
1343160,1344500," What I am doing right now."
1344500,1348200," I am experimenting with immediate UI approach."
1348200,1349240," But, for the terminal."
1349240,1350780," That's what I am doing."
1350780,1355460," So, this application is experimental playground."
1355460,1356520," Right."
1356520,1357640," So, yeah."
1357640,1360400," I am just exploring how to do this kind of stuff."
1360400,1361160," But, for the terminal."
1361160,1362420," Because, people explore that."
1362420,1363520," How to do this kind of stuff."
1363520,1366400," For the GUI quite a lot."
1366400,1369180," But, I didn't see people doing that for the terminal very often."
1369280,1370320," Maybe somebody does that."
1370320,1371540," I don't know."
1371540,1378960," Never heard of that."
1378960,1379160," Yeah."
1379160,1379600," I also."
1379600,1380180," Like."
1380180,1381000," I heard about it."
1381000,1381160," Like."
1381160,1382140," A couple of years ago."
1382140,1382580," I think."
1382580,1385260," And, I didn't really."
1385260,1386520," I basically brushed it off."
1386520,1388040," I didn't really look into it that much."
1388040,1388620," But, recently."
1388620,1390740," I decided to just take a look into it."
1390740,1392200," And, it's actually really fascinating."
1392200,1395680," Because, it is really not obvious approach."
1395680,1397120," But, at the same time."
1397120,1398480," It is very powerful."
1399220,1400900," And, the reason why it's not obvious."
1400900,1403480," Because, it looks really messy at first."
1403480,1404020," Right."
1404020,1404940," If you look at this approach."
1404940,1405240," You would see."
1405240,1406180," What the fuck is."
1406180,1406780," What the fuck."
1406780,1408060," Who writes UI like that."
1408060,1408860," But, then."
1408860,1411460," As you try to implement your own immediate UI."
1411460,1413400," And, as you encounter some problems."
1413400,1415800," With other UI frameworks."
1415800,1416540," You start to realize."
1416540,1416880," Oh."
1416880,1418940," That's actually very convenient."
1418940,1421120," It actually solves a lot of problems."
1421120,1424140," That I had with other retained mod UIs."
1424540,1425880," Like, in here."
1425880,1427220," You don't really have."
1427220,1428800," Like, the whole class of problems."
1428800,1430280," That the classical UIs have."
1430280,1430820," And, it's just like."
1430820,1432000," Wow."
1432000,1433120," That's very interesting."
1433120,1434760," So, yeah."
1434760,1435800," I really recommend to look into."
1435800,1436980," The immediate UI approaches."
1444980,1448000," So, and every time you experiment with something."
1448000,1449420," People usually do."
1449420,1450400," Like, a to-do app."
1450400,1451240," And, I decided to."
1451240,1452280," Let's make it to-do app."
1454280,1457380," Have you used Win32 GUI API?"
1457380,1457780," Yes."
1457780,1458880," I did when I was a student."
1458880,1459980," Like, really long time ago."
1459980,1462340," So, I haven't touched WinAPI."
1462340,1463440," For quite some time already."
1463440,1466640," All right."
1466640,1468500," So, let's continue."
1468500,1472980," So, what do we have in here?"
1472980,1474600," We have a left and right panel."
1474600,1475140," Right."
1475140,1477660," So, okay."
1477660,1478720," So, oh."
1478720,1478980," Okay."
1478980,1480060," This one is very interesting."
1480060,1482320," So, that means I need to."
1482320,1485120," Change this thing to done."
1485120,1485480," Right."
1485480,1485960," Because."
1485960,1486360," Yeah."
1486360,1493840," All right."
1493840,1494900," So, looks good to me."
1494900,1495840," Looks good to me."
1495840,1497340," Okay."
1497340,1497740," Now."
1497740,1502040," I basically need to."
1502040,1504200," Copy paste this entire thing."
1504200,1506060," To each an individual part in here."
1506060,1507980," So, if to-do is activated."
1508760,1511720," I will try to consume the current key."
1511720,1516640," And do some things."
1516640,1516980," Right."
1516980,1518800," So, let's see how we can do all of that."
1518800,1527220," So, but what's interesting in this particular case is that since I know for a fact that I'm inside of to-do."
1527220,1531440," I don't need to match the panel here anymore."
1531440,1534140," You see, I already checked it here."
1534320,1541580," So, basically we're taking this consolidating huge match and we're spreading it across the rendering of UI."
1541580,1544780," And because of that, that match becomes like simpler."
1544780,1545120," Right."
1545120,1547080," Because we don't need to do this kind of stuff anymore."
1547080,1551740," What we can do is just like simply do that."
1551740,1552980," But for the to-do."
1552980,1554140," There you go."
1554220,1557560," And each individual branch can be actually compressed into a single thing."
1557560,1560100," So, yeah."
1560100,1561800," Let's see how we can do this."
1561800,1563080," Yep."
1563080,1567840," That's actually pretty cool."
1567840,1569020," Huh."
1569660,1584120," So, and of course some of these things can be moved into a separate functions and whatnot."
1584120,1590220," Maybe it's going to be like a single function that accepts these two things and a current key."
1590360,1596140," And we can call this function something like a panel control or whatever."
1596140,1596780," Right."
1596780,1599700," And then we can reuse that function for both left and right panel."
1599700,1601000," But that's beside the point."
1601000,1609480," For now, yet again, I want to copy-paste as much as possible to make the patterns that we can compress later more visible."
1611700,1612140," Right."
1612140,1618960," Because it's kind of like a waste of time to try to compress and refactor things as soon as possible."
1618960,1623480," Because you don't have enough information on how to refactor things."
1623480,1625140," I keep repeating that over and over again."
1625140,1626700," It seems like people don't understand that."
1626700,1627360," Right."
1627360,1630940," Every time people see my code, their immediate reaction is that,"
1630940,1632940," Oh my God, there's so much duplication."
1632940,1633840," We need to refactor it."
1633840,1634680," No, no, no, no, no, no."
1634680,1636200," Refactor."
1636200,1640960," If you refactor too early, you may actually miss very important patterns."
1640960,1641660," Right."
1641700,1646080," As you refactor, the more you refactor, the refactors, the less you can do the refactoring."
1646080,1647280," It's like optimizations."
1647280,1647940," Right."
1647940,1651420," People who wrote optimizations for the competitors, they know really, really well."
1651420,1655860," The more you apply optimization, the less you can apply other optimizations."
1655860,1657540," Yes."
1657540,1662420," So this is the problem that the compiler developers have to deal with every fucking day."
1662420,1664080," So they have a bunch of optimizations."
1664080,1667680," Applying one optimization actually removes another optimization."
1667680,1670380," And what sequence of optimizations we need to apply?"
1670700,1675040," And there's like very complicated algorithms that take all of the optimizations and try to"
1675040,1677620," apply it and see which code produces the optimal ones."
1677620,1681200," There's the idea of using artificial intelligence on applying different optimizations."
1681200,1682240," It's a mess."
1682240,1683980," It's the same thing here."
1683980,1688960," The more you compress, the more you refactor things, the less you can compress and refactor"
1688960,1689420," things."
1689420,1697260," So you need to sort of develop an intuition at which point you need to factor out the duplication."
1697260,1697720," Right."
1697720,1703040," So you need to let the duplication grow up until some point where interesting patterns start"
1703040,1703600," to emerge."
1703600,1707860," And only then you can actually extract it out."
1707920,1709860," I cannot give you any specific tip on that."
1709860,1711040," It's sort of like an intuition."
1711040,1718120," And I do realize that explaining all of that is completely pointless because in two days somebody"
1718120,1719660," is going to ask about it yet again."
1721080,1734480," It's like something that I keep explaining over and over and over again."
1734480,1736540," And people always, oh, there's so much duplicate."
1736540,1738980," Maybe you should make a video about that."
1738980,1739680," I don't know."
1739680,1744560," It's just like how long I have to explain that over and over again."
1748080,1760220," Oh, by the way, premature optimization is root of all evil is one of these phrases that people"
1760220,1763160," like to throw around regardless of the context."
1763160,1768580," And yet nobody remembers in which constant that context it was actually set."
1768580,1776360," So to be fair, it's like this phrase is beaten to such an extent that it's basically meaningless"
1776360,1780980," a combination of words because we don't even remember what Knuth actually meant by that"
1780980,1781300," phrase."
1781300,1782680," Like, what the fuck did he say?"
1782680,1787060," There's so many articles written about that phrase saying, no, he actually meant that."
1787060,1788520," No, he actually meant that."
1788520,1791240," It's like, it's a fucking dead horse."
1791240,1792100," Stop beating me."
1792100,1793840," All right."
1793840,1795060," So let's continue."
1795060,1798880," So here we have that."
1798880,1802760," And yeah, we don't have to handle the cue."
1803560,1803980," All right."
1803980,1806860," And yeah, this is the very interesting thing."
1806860,1809900," When you press enter, you're transferring this thing."
1809900,1810600," And there we go."
1810600,1814920," And when I press tab, I actually switch the panel."
1814920,1817020," And otherwise, we're actually doing nothing."
1817020,1817400," All right."
1817400,1817620," All right."
1817620,1817780," All right."
1817780,1821860," So this is basically the thingy."
1826800,1832620," So now I should be able to control the left panel, right?"
1832620,1834360," I should be able to control the left panel."
1834360,1838220," So, but this one is very interesting."
1838220,1849260," So can I do something like, well, technically I can try to do key current map like this."
1849260,1858880," And then I'll have to be forced to sort of wrap all of these things in some."
1858880,1860840," Right."
1860840,1862960," And it's going to be something like that."
1862960,1868600," All right."
1868600,1869440," So there we go."
1872120,1878420," Though, if we had a key in here, do we want to be able to consume?"
1878420,1880780," I think, yeah, I think we want to be able to consume it."
1880780,1884320," So I suppose I'm going to do the following thing."
1884320,1887880," I'm going to match the key current."
1887880,1888380," Right."
1888380,1889360," It's going to be key current."
1889580,1891220," And if it has something in there."
1891220,1893120," All right."
1893120,1902240," By the way, does the option have a particular way to just take a value out of it in a mutable way?"
1902240,1904380," Not immutable one, but in a mutable one."
1904380,1906820," So let me see."
1906820,1907380," Let me see."
1907380,1911820," Does option have anything useful for that?"
1911820,1915720," Insert."
1915720,1916700," You can insert."
1916700,1917780," Insert sounds interesting."
1919580,1921620," It's actually opposite of take."
1921620,1924660," So is there a take?"
1924660,1926040," Oh, there is a take."
1926040,1926240," Okay."
1926240,1927160," It's literally called like that."
1927160,1927420," Perfect."
1927420,1931820," Okay."
1931820,1933020," So wait, wait, wait."
1933020,1934100," Maybe there is a get."
1934100,1939640," No, it's useless."
1939640,1944320," Get or insert."
1944320,1948820," Well, I mean, I probably can do something like if."
1949580,1958660," If let some key, some key equal to that thing, and then we can convert it like that."
1958660,1964720," And yeah, essentially, after that, I can say that key current is going to be key."
1964720,1965540," There we go."
1969620,1971840," Cyclic type of infinite size."
1971840,1974260," I've actually went to none, to do none."
1974260,1976400," All right."
1976400,1978700," So that's good."
1978700,1980140," And if I try to."
1980140,1981280," Oh, wait, wait."
1981280,1982680," This shit doesn't work for some reason."
1982680,1983680," Okay."
1983680,1986920," Nothing is working, surprisingly."
1989020,1991340," So why did it stop working, precisely?"
1991340,1995320," Did I make some changes that actually made it stop working?"
1995320,1997440," Because I'm handling Q in here."
1998220,2000660," And if I press Q, it should just work."
2000660,2001160," Did I?"
2001160,2004900," How did it stop working?"
2004900,2005640," Excuse me."
2005640,2010040," So that's really weird."
2020580,2035960," I missed something very, very stupid."
2035960,2037360," Yet again."
2037360,2041340," But the question is, what precisely did I miss?"
2041340,2042400," Right."
2043360,2044400," Oh, yeah, I see."
2044400,2045120," I'm an idiot."
2045120,2045780," Right."
2045780,2050320," Because we're essentially getting the key, but we're handing the key on the next."
2050320,2051000," Okay, I see."
2051000,2052420," I see."
2052420,2052660," I see."
2052660,2056640," If nobody handled that key, well, I guess it's going to stay there."
2056640,2058000," Yeah."
2058000,2059520," At least for now."
2059520,2060200," Right."
2060200,2064140," So, and in here, as you can see, I can finally control the left panel."
2064140,2065680," Right."
2065680,2072540," And I can switch to the right panel, but I cannot switch back because the right panel doesn't even do anything."
2072540,2072940," Right."
2073040,2078960," So, we need to basically copy this logic back to the right panel."
2078960,2079540," Right."
2079540,2083940," We need to copy it back to the right panel."
2083940,2089540," And so, in the right panel, we're only going to handle this kind of stuff when the right panel is active."
2089540,2090340," Right."
2090340,2092040," So, that means I need to put it in here."
2092040,2097960," And here, essentially, I'm going to do to do, but replace it with done."
2097960,2098820," Yeah, what's up?"
2098820,2099240," Hi."
2099240,2100440," How are you doing?"
2100440,2102140," How are you doing?"
2102720,2108260," So, and in here, I actually need to do this kind of thing."
2109020,2111220," No, no, not done yet."
2111220,2113640," So, this is going to be this thing."
2113640,2114600," Right."
2114600,2115480," List transfer."
2115480,2116220," Done."
2116220,2126060," So, the destination has to be to do's, but the thing has to be done's."
2127360,2131140," And, yeah, that's actually precisely what I wanted to do in here."
2131140,2134240," I guess that's it."
2134240,2134620," Right."
2134620,2141840," So, essentially, we took this huge switch case and spread it across the entire event loop."
2141840,2142260," Right."
2142360,2144740," So, that's precisely what I wanted to do in here."
2144740,2145520," So, that's precisely what I wanted to do in here, I think."
2145520,2147220," Right."
2147220,2149080," Okay."
2149080,2149740," Does it compile?"
2149740,2150680," Does it still compile?"
2150680,2151820," Okay."
2151820,2160200," So, when the elements are inactive, by the way, we don't really care about their indices, which actually makes it easier for us to iterate them."
2160400,2160560," Right."
2160560,2164920," So, essentially, you start this thing, you just iterate it, and that's precisely it."
2164920,2167660," And the same goes for the to do."
2167660,2169440," And so, for the done, I mean."
2169440,2172260," So, we don't need to enumerate anything in here."
2172260,2172720," Right."
2172720,2180060," And so, this one has to be query replaced to do with done."
2180060,2181140," I could do hello."
2181140,2181560," Hello."
2181560,2182420," Welcome to the stream."
2182420,2189160," Okay."
2190400,2191200," All right."
2191200,2194620," So, let's try to recompile this into that thing and see if it's working."
2194620,2196280," So, okay."
2196280,2198540," As far as I can see, we don't have any warnings in here."
2198540,2200220," And, yep."
2200220,2202580," Oh, that's very interesting."
2202580,2204820," All right."
2204820,2206720," So, you see what's going on here?"
2206720,2210240," It tries to render done as to do's when you switch to."
2210240,2210840," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2210840,2213180," So, that's what copy paste does to you."
2213180,2218920," So, when this thing is active, yeah, I'm iterating to do's."
2218920,2220440," So, I need to actually do it like that."
2220440,2226460," So, I need to query replace done with actually the other way around."
2226460,2228440," To do to done."
2228440,2229480," To do to done."
2229480,2232600," And let's try to do it one more time."
2232600,2234820," Yep, yep, yep."
2234820,2237080," So, everything seems to be working."
2237080,2239020," All right."
2239020,2240080," Everything seems to be working."
2240200,2240400," Okay."
2240400,2242620," So, I did the refactoring."
2242620,2246180," So, now all of that stuff is handled immediately."
2246180,2248800," All of that stuff is handled immediately."
2248800,2251040," Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful."
2251040,2255280," We might as well actually first handle the keys and then render the thing."
2255280,2255940," But I'm not sure."
2255940,2257360," Hello, orphan."
2257360,2258700," Welcome to the stream."
2260700,2263860," So, that means I can finally get rid of this entire thing."
2263860,2272000," So, I'm just a junior copy pacer."
2272000,2274760," No, I'm a senior clown on the internet."
2274760,2279620," I'm really proficient in clowning on the internet."
2280900,2282500," So, that's who I am."
2282500,2284760," That's what I be."
2284760,2287320," No, you know what I'm talking about."
2287320,2296720," Clowning executive officer."
2296720,2298320," That's me."
2298320,2299000," That's really me."
2299000,2301400," Hello, trusty cause."
2301400,2303000," Welcome."
2303000,2304500," Welcome to the stream."
2304500,2305380," How are we doing?"
2305380,2309740," Look at that code."
2310100,2311200," Look at that code."
2311200,2312840," Oh, no, no, no, no."
2312840,2317600," So, yeah."
2317600,2318520," So far, so good."
2318520,2319540," So far, so good."
2319540,2327980," I really like how this kind of stuff is just like localized in places where it needs to be localized."
2327980,2328940," Okay."
2328940,2337840," So, might as well run this entire thing."
2337840,2339300," I just want to test things."
2339300,2340860," Let's test things one more time."
2340860,2342920," One more time."
2342920,2346160," And can I delete things?"
2346160,2346820," I can."
2346820,2355700," Maybe when I delete something, it would also make sense to say in a notification."
2355700,2357700," You see, like here we have a thing."
2358500,2363800," Let me actually go here and restore the to-do chat, chat, chat, look, look, look."
2363800,2368720," When you actually mark something as done, it says done in here."
2368720,2373740," But then if you're not sure if something is done, you can move it back and it says no, not done yet."
2373740,2375440," So, we have a notification system."
2375440,2381520," So, we have a notification system that allows you to put messages in there when you do particular actions, which is pretty cool."
2381520,2389600," So, maybe when you delete an item, we can say something."
2389840,2391040," Oh, here's an interesting thing."
2391040,2396460," For instance, now I can forbid deletion of the items in the to-do list, right?"
2396460,2399300," So, right now you can delete an item from to-do."
2399300,2402620," But I think it's kind of like not the correct way to do that, right?"
2402680,2409700," So, let's actually first force the user to move the thing into done and only then you will be able to delete it."
2409700,2411440," I think it's an interesting idea, right?"
2411440,2413460," So, I cannot delete thing from to-do."
2413460,2417980," I have to mark it as done and only then inside of the done, I can delete it."
2417980,2419700," I guess it makes sense, right?"
2419700,2422280," So, you cannot delete a thing in here."
2422280,2426260," So, and when you delete, we can say something, right?"
2426260,2427800," We can say something."
2427800,2432860," For instance, notification."
2432860,2435880," How do we set notifications?"
2435880,2436660," I don't even know."
2436660,2440260," We just usually push str, I suppose, right?"
2440260,2447480," So, it's going to be push str into the abyss."
2447480,2450100," Into the abyss, right?"
2450100,2455840," So, every time you delete a thing, it will tell you into the abyss, right?"
2455840,2463080," So, done, done, something is not done yet and this one is essentially into the abyss, right?"
2463080,2464520," And there we go."
2464520,2466460," So, that's pretty cool."
2466460,2470600," So, and all of that is relatively convenient to actually code, right?"
2470600,2474640," You code that in a place where you actually care about this kind of stuff."
2474640,2475420," I really like that."
2475420,2477940," I really, really like that."
2477940,2500420," So, let's do a committee committee and maybe even a pushy-pushy to smear the control switch case"
2500420,2508060," So, that's literally the commit message, right?"
2508060,2509860," This is literally the commit message."
2509860,2511920," All right."
2511920,2514000," So, that's precisely what we did."
2514000,2519940," So, that's precisely what we did."
2519940,2523100," That's precisely what we did."
2523740,2526120," Random singing, Peppa Paints, by the way."
2526120,2534060," So, the next thing we need to do, we need to introduce a way to actually edit the current things, right?"
2534060,2535880," We need to edit the current things."
2541300,2548160," So, I suppose we're going to have a special Boolean variable, right?"
2548160,2551480," So, editing, which initially is going to be false."
2551480,2558500," But, if you, for instance, in a to-do, in a to-do setting, right?"
2558500,2567680," And you press something like I, you press something like I, you're going to switch into the editing mode, right?"
2567680,2572260," So, it's going to be something like editing, and it's going to be, it's going to become true."
2572260,2578040," And if you are in editing mode, this kind of stuff is going to render slightly differently."
2578040,2579440," All right."
2579440,2582500," So, let me, let me actually see."
2591680,2596800," So, if this is the current element."
2596800,2603280," If index is that, right?"
2603280,2610300," If index is that, we have to render this thing with the highlighted stuff, right?"
2610300,2612200," So, this is going to be a highlighted thing."
2612200,2614640," Yep, yep, yep."
2614640,2616460," Right?"
2617000,2620840," So, otherwise, this is not going to be a highlighted thing."
2620840,2623160," Uh, regular."
2623160,2626820," Um, all right."
2626820,2633000," But, if it's a current thing, and we're currently in an editing mode, right?"
2633000,2638540," We have to actually render it as an editor of some sort."
2638540,2640100," Uh, right."
2640140,2642380," So, this one is going to be to do, right?"
2642380,2644060," So, this thing is not implemented."
2644060,2647340," It's going to, this is going to be to do."
2647340,2659640," Um, and if you are in editing mode, I suppose you need to actually handle this thing slightly differently."
2659640,2667920," So, I'm thinking, um, only if you're not in editing mode, you're going to try to handle this stuff around in here."
2668520,2669540," Yeah, there we go."
2669540,2672320," Uh, something like this."
2672320,2674800," And we need to put something in here, right?"
2674800,2677760," So, if you're editing, um, yeah."
2677760,2680380," Not quite sure."
2680380,2690900," So, maybe the UI is going to have, uh, a special method that will, um, basically render, um, render this thing as an editor."
2696900,2698740," How do you mean so many programming languages?"
2698740,2700440," It's answered in FAQ."
2700440,2706280," It is, in fact, answered in FAQ."
2706280,2708860," Believe it or not, here's your answer."
2708860,2711920," Um, look."
2711920,2712320," Look."
2712320,2713180," Down there."
2713180,2714320," Down there."
2714320,2719320," Uh, well, it's not precisely, but, I mean, how many languages do you know?"
2719320,2720860," The answer is very simple."
2721420,2722520," I don't need to know any."
2722520,2724860," I just copy-paste code from the second phone."
2724860,2727860," That's, that's your answer."
2727860,2729180," You just have to read carefully."
2729180,2733020," All of the answers you guys have are answered in FAQ."
2733020,2733700," I mean, questions."
2733700,2734860," All of the questions, not the answers."
2734860,2736020," But maybe answers as well."
2736020,2737920," Uh, so, yeah."
2737920,2738760," Everything is answered."
2738900,2740300," Like, I mean, just go into FAQ."
2740300,2740840," It's there."
2740840,2743200," Um, I mean, it ain't in everything."
2743200,2743780," Just for you."
2743780,2745480," No need to ask anything."
2745480,2746840," Mm-mm."
2746840,2748880," Mm-mm."
2750320,2753460," I did read that, but, I mean, that's the answer."
2753460,2757000," It's a good answer whether you like it or not."
2757000,2757520," It's true."
2757520,2761480," You may not like it, but it's a true answer."
2761480,2763400," That's, that's the reality we live in."
2763400,2767860," I'm really sorry to tell you, but nobody knows shit in 2021."
2767860,2769440," Nobody knows how to program."
2769440,2770060," Okay?"
2770060,2772060," Everyone copy-paste from Stack Overflow."
2772060,2773500," And that's how I know all of that."
2773500,2775500," I just, I just copy-paste shit from Stack Overflow."
2775500,2780200," I know it's a little bit embarrassing for some people to admit, but I don't give a shit."
2780440,2780640," Right."
2780640,2782280," So, yeah."
2782280,2783940," I copy-paste shit from Stack Overflow."
2783940,2784860," I don't know anything."
2784860,2787140," Uh, and, uh, yeah."
2787140,2788060," Don't worry about it."
2788060,2789280," Mm-mm."
2789280,2792920," I copy-paste from Expert Exchange."
2792920,2795440," Mm-mm."
2795440,2798060," But who pastes this shit to Stack Overflow?"
2798060,2799900," It's also copy-pasted from Stack Overflow."
2799900,2802160," Mm-mm."
2802160,2807740," One FAQ is missing."
2807740,2809000," What do you think of PHP?"
2809380,2811300," Do you know what FAQ stands for?"
2811300,2813800," Do you know what FAQ stands for?"
2813800,2817720," It's, it's abbreviation, by the way."
2817720,2820380," Not everybody knows, but it's an abbreviation."
2820380,2827860," Uh, it stands for Frequently Asked Questions."
2827860,2830920," Um, how to tell you."
2831580,2838620," So, essentially, if you don't see your question in FAQ, I have a really bad news for you."
2838620,2844160," Um, sorry."
2847300,2850880," Uh, it's just, like, no offense."
2850880,2853540," It's, no offense."
2853540,2854180," Sorry."
2856760,2881840," Um, so now, um, when we are in editing mode, uh, on top of that, I think I also need to keep track of the, some sort of, like, um, uh, editing cursor."
2881840,2884500," Right, so this is going to be editing cursor."
2884500,2890500," Right, so, and that cursor is going to maintain the position of the cursor as we edit things around."
2890840,2898500," And as I switch to the editing mode, right, as I switch to the editing mode, I think I'm going to also set in, set the editing cursor to zero."
2899180,2905780," Uh, right, to indicate that we're studying, maybe not zero, but, eh, uh, let's put zero for now."
2905780,2907340," We'll see how it goes in the future."
2907340,2921000," Um, um, um, um, so, and now, yeah, what I wanted to introduce in here is the, uh, editor field."
2921660,2931580," So, edit field, right, so this is going to be edit field, and this thing is going to be mutable, uh, and here, this thing is slightly different."
2931580,2938660," So, when you render a label, right, when you render the text, right, uh, we just provide the slice of the string."
2938660,2947740," But here, we'll have to provide the buffer as a mutable string, right, because the edit field is going to modify, um, the, the field."
2949000,2959720," So, now, uh, I also need to provide the cursor, right, so, which is a mutable pointer to the, uh, to the cursor, which is also going to be updated."
2959720,2963040," Um, and do we need to provide anything else?"
2963040,2964120," Uh, I'm not quite sure."
2964120,2969620," Maybe we should provide the, the key, right, so we need to provide the key."
2969620,2977400," Uh, I think it's like i32, right, uh, because depending on the key, um, this entire thing is going to do different things, right?"
2977400,2982020," So, if you pressed ASCII, uh, keys, they're going to be inserted into the current cursor."
2982020,2987060," If you pressed arrows, uh, it's going to update the cursor and so on and so forth."
2987060,2989480," So, yeah, I think it would make sense."
2989480,2993060," So, this is going to be a to-do, uh, right."
2993060,3001680," And now, uh, when, uh, the to-do is active, we're rendering the to-do."
3001680,3005700," Uh, we found the current index and we are in editing mode."
3005700,3013300," What we have to do here, in fact, is, uh, UI, uh, edit, uh, edit field."
3013300,3019160," Uh, edit field and let's actually put this entire thing here, right?"
3019160,3023160," So, this is going to be edit field, uh, right, like this."
3023240,3028380," You don't need that stuff anymore and we need to grab the buffer from somewhere, right?"
3028380,3030200," We need to grab, uh, the buffer from somewhere."
3030200,3033880," So, I don't know where to get it from, but we can do something like this."
3033880,3038480," So, it's going to be editing cursor, uh, editing cursor and then the key."
3038480,3041320," So, the buffer has to be the current element."
3041320,3043500," We have the current element in here."
3044180,3049520," Uh, but the iter, as far as I know, returns, uh, immutable thing."
3049520,3052040," So, maybe there's something like iter mute."
3052040,3054300," Let me actually go to the vector."
3054300,3056300," Let me actually go to the vector."
3056300,3062840," So, it's going to be iter."
3062840,3068580," Uh, it's, it's actually, eh, maybe it's a part of the slice."
3068660,3070300," I think it's a part of the slice, yeah."
3070300,3074500," It's a part of the slice and there should be iter mute."
3074500,3075220," There we go."
3075220,3078320," And the item is, okay, that makes sense."
3078320,3079040," That makes sense."
3079040,3080200," So, let's do iter mute."
3080200,3081900," All right."
3081900,3086660," So, that means, uh, I can provide this thing like so."
3086660,3087460," There we go."
3087460,3089260," So, then the editing cursor."
3089260,3093080," But the key, the current key can be actually known."
3093080,3098200," So, maybe we should allow, uh, the edit field to be option."
3098540,3098780," Right."
3098780,3100420," So, because it might be missing."
3100420,3102600," Because the user didn't press anything yet."
3102600,3105240," So, yeah, that's, that's pretty cool."
3105240,3106820," So, let's, let's put it like that."
3106820,3109960," Uh, and this is going to be key current."
3109960,3112260," Uh, and that's going to be the implementation."
3112260,3113140," Look at that."
3113140,3118040," So, we have, uh, several situations where the element is current."
3118040,3120680," And if we're in editing mode, we're editing that element."
3120680,3122220," If we're not, we're just highlighting it."
3122220,3125180," And if it's not the current element, we don't do anything with it."
3125180,3127220," So, that's the entire logic."
3127780,3131760," And if we're not in editing mode, we're handling these keys."
3131760,3133480," To be fair."
3136700,3137900," You know what?"
3137900,3144240," What if the edit field consumes the key?"
3144240,3146940," Holy shit."
3146940,3149000," That's a cool idea."
3149000,3151680," So, what if the edit field consumes the key?"
3151680,3154680," So, that means this, this has to be a mutable thing in here."
3154680,3155220," Right."
3155220,3156280," It consumes the key."
3156280,3159060," And because of that, I never have to do this kind of shit anymore."
3159400,3161640," Because you never have a key, right?"
3161640,3163240," So, because it was consumed before."
3163240,3169760," And the only reason why it wouldn't be consumed is, uh, because never, nobody ever called edit field."
3169760,3171020," So, nobody consumed it."
3171020,3172120," This is actually genius."
3172980,3173360," Oh, my God."
3173360,3175380," This makes it so much simpler."
3175380,3176520," Holy shit."
3176520,3179940," Like, this immediate approach keeps on giving."
3179940,3181700," Actually, it keeps simplifying things."
3181700,3181940," Yeah."
3181940,3184140," So, you just consumed."
3184140,3185900," Like, you don't have to worry about this shit anymore."
3186960,3190380," Um, the only problem here is that, like, how do we handle queue and whatnot?"
3190380,3194260," We can actually handle queue after the entire application."
3194260,3194480," Okay."
3194480,3197560," So, the entire application, uh, did its thing, right?"
3197560,3198980," Some of the things got consumed."
3198980,3204800," Uh, and if at the end of the application, at the end of the application, um, nothing was consumed,"
3204800,3206580," only then we can check for the queue."
3206580,3206880," Okay."
3206880,3212500," So, it's quite important because, uh, the edit field wanna be able to handle the queue, right?"
3212500,3216560," Because maybe the queue is something that you wanna type into the, uh, into the element, right?"
3216920,3218360," So, we do the entire rendering."
3218360,3222600," If nothing got consumed through the entire rendering, okay, we can take a look at the queue."
3222600,3224180," Okay, it's queue and we quit."
3224180,3226580," Uh, so, makes sense to me."
3226580,3228620," Uh, definitely makes sense to me."
3228620,3230180," All right."
3230180,3231960," That's actually pretty cool."
3231960,3232700," I really like that."
3232700,3235860," Uh, so, and do we have to check anything for editing?"
3235860,3237260," It's just, like, makes everything simple."
3237260,3238720," God damn."
3238720,3240640," God fucking damn it."
3240640,3242180," I like simple things."
3242180,3244580," What do you guys think?"
3244580,3246120," Do you guys like simple things?"
3246240,3248140," Or you like overcomplicated things?"
3248140,3253000," Like, which, with shed tone of traits and, uh, lifetimes and stuff like that."
3253000,3255760," What kind of stuff do you like?"
3255760,3258060," Simple."
3258060,3258660," Feels good."
3258660,3259200," Same."
3259200,3259680," Same."
3259680,3263880," Um, cheers, by the way."
3271880,3277200," It's like, it's simple as dimple."
3277200,3277680," Haha."
3277680,3278920," Very funny."
3278920,3284680," Okay."
3284680,3287520," So, this one has to be, like, a mutable current key."
3289340,3289760," All right."
3289760,3289840," All right."
3289840,3292040," So, we have unused stuff in here."
3292040,3293840," So, all of that is just unused fields."
3293840,3296180," And now, we need to implement all of this stuff."
3296180,3297800," We need to implement all of this stuff."
3297800,3301580," How are we going to be implementing all of this stuff?"
3301580,3302780," That's a good question."
3302780,3304660," That's a good question."
3304660,3311900," Also, we need to be able to get out of the, uh, edit, edit mode."
3312160,3315840," If you know what I'm talking about, uh, we also need to be able to do that."
3315840,3318280," Uh, and the question is, how are we going to be doing that?"
3318280,3330280," Um, so, I think before trying to do this kind of stuff, I'm still, I still want to have something"
3330280,3335900," like take, uh, but take in the rust is not precisely doing what I want to do."
3335900,3336880," So, let me, let me see."
3336880,3338320," Let me see what it's doing in there."
3339680,3341420," Uh, hello, Kenful."
3341420,3342300," Welcome to the stream."
3342300,3343240," Hello, party, deep."
3343240,3343920," Welcome, welcome."
3343920,3344640," How are you guys doing?"
3344640,3352180," Um, so, let me take a look."
3352180,3353740," So, it is, oh, okay."
3353740,3356520," So, that means actually, so, we have a mutable X."
3356520,3357040," Okay."
3357040,3359240," So, maybe that's pretty accessible to what I want to use in here."
3359240,3360720," Hmm."
3360720,3363080," All right."
3363080,3364000," So, maybe that makes sense."
3364000,3369160," So, I can do if let, uh, some, um, right."
3369240,3370680," So, it's going to be key current."
3370680,3372760," But I have to actually take it."
3372760,3373300," All right."
3373300,3376460," Hmm."
3376460,3376620," Hmm."
3376620,3384340," So, I want to only check, but I don't want to consume."
3384340,3387540," I really don't want to consume this kind of stuff."
3389020,3391920," Um, so, we can take, uh, this thing."
3391920,3396120," And I'm going to just do X, X as U8 as character."
3396120,3401020," Uh, and if this entire thing is equal to the new line, right."
3401020,3405440," If it's equal to the new line, I'm switching out of the editing mode."
3405440,3406040," Right."
3406040,3408900," I'm just doing something like, uh, false."
3408900,3418040," To be fair, maybe edit field is not going to consume this thing, right."
3418040,3420240," Maybe edit field is not going to consume this thing."
3420240,3422580," So, because of that, we'll be able to do it like that."
3422580,3428900," Uh, so, that means I want to take, uh, this entire thing, then map it, and then set the editing"
3428900,3429640," to false."
3429640,3432200," And on the next frame is going to be updated properly."
3432200,3433260," Yeah."
3433260,3435040," So, that's, that's pretty cool."
3435040,3437860," Mm-hmm."
3437860,3439560," So, here's the edit field."
3439560,3442700," Uh, we edit in to do, then the cursor, then the current."
3442700,3448560," And if we still have something unconsumed here, and that something is enter, we, uh, get out"
3448560,3451720," of the editing, uh, mode and continue with our day."
3451720,3454000," Um, all right."
3454000,3454540," Oh, my God."
3454540,3455240," It's so beautiful."
3455240,3457660," Uh-huh."
3457660,3458620," All right."
3458680,3459740," So, the buffer."
3459740,3460120," Okay."
3460120,3463020," So, let me actually mark these things as unused, because they're getting really annoying."
3463020,3466300," Uh, I'm surprised this shit compiles."
3466300,3468240," I'm really surprised this shit compiles."
3468240,3470000," So, all right."
3470000,3472780," And now, uh, let me try to do something like this."
3472780,3478560," I'm going to, uh, render, um, self label with fixed width."
3478560,3483880," Um, to be fair, I think I want to be able to provide the width here as well."
3483880,3485920," Um, so, let's put it like this."
3485920,3486660," It's going to be width."
3486660,3488040," I, 32."
3488040,3489840," All right."
3489840,3492620," And, uh, this is how we're going to be doing all of that."
3492620,3495940," Uh, the text is going to be essentially the buffer, right?"
3495940,3496960," So, here's the buffer."
3496960,3498240," The width is here."
3498760,3501260," And the pair, we're going to use the regular pair, right?"
3501260,3501280," And the pair, we're going to use the regular pair, right?"
3501280,3503060," So, here is the regular pair."
3503060,3505780," Uh, that's pretty much it."
3505780,3506940," Uh, buffer."
3506940,3509460," So, this is the buffer cursor."
3509460,3510800," We don't care about the cursor."
3511360,3513460," And, uh, let's go through the compilation errors."
3513460,3514920," And what do we have in here?"
3514920,3517440," So, width is going to be a 2."
3517440,3519380," All right."
3519380,3522860," Can I, by the way, uh, do the following thing?"
3522980,3527620," So, uh, it's fine, I guess."
3527620,3528400," I guess it's fine."
3528400,3528960," Okay."
3528960,3530580," So, here's the thing."
3530580,3531920," I can navigate around."
3531920,3538200," And now, if I press enter, we should go into the editing mode, which doesn't contain this prefix."
3538200,3539500," And it's not highlighted."
3539500,3540120," Right."
3540120,3542520," And the reason why it looks like that is because it's not implemented yet."
3542520,3545940," We are in editing mode for that specific thing."
3545940,3547460," And as you can see, I cannot edit anything."
3547460,3548440," I'm pressing all the keys."
3548440,3551580," But if I press enter, it sort of gets committed."
3551580,3553360," And now, I can navigate around it again."
3553360,3558480," So, as you can see, I, yeah, I can enter the editing mode for any of these things."
3558480,3560300," And it's so goddamn simple."
3560300,3562800," I, why is this so simple?"
3562800,3565120," Why nobody told me about this approach before?"
3565120,3567980," I know that it looks messy, but it's kind of the point."
3568200,3571620," The messiness of this approach actually makes it simple, because it's straightforward."
3571620,3573480," Holy shit."
3573480,3575380," What the fuck?"
3575380,3586440," It's like, you intentionally make it messy, and there's some, something interesting arises from the, from, from the mess."
3586440,3587380," And it's just like, eh?"
3587380,3591380," Am I being too, like, it's kind of difficult to explain."
3591380,3592360," Like, what the fuck?"
3592360,3594000," Hmm."
3596360,3605240," Once you abandon this idea of, sort of, preparing the UI tree, and then treat, giving that UI tree to some system, and then callbacks."
3605240,3608700," Once you abandon that, you can actually come up with a better approach."
3608700,3610880," This is so goddamn simple."
3610880,3613760," The unexpected beauty in the mess."
3613760,3614920," Yeah, that's what it feels like."
3614920,3616380," It's unexpected beauty in the mess."
3617080,3618260," Um, okay."
3618260,3620160," Um, maybe."
3620160,3621340," I don't know."
3621340,3623680," I don't know how well this approach scales, though."
3623680,3626660," Maybe it works because the application is rather simple."
3626660,3632160," But the amount of code I have to put in to get the result is astonishing."
3632160,3637080," The ratio between effort and result is amazing, actually."
3637520,3640540," So, the entire application, the entire application can do a lot of things."
3640540,3646000," Like, move around, delete things, and then, like, switch to editor mode, and so on and so forth."
3646000,3650360," The entire code is only, almost 500 lines of code."
3650360,3652460," And it's actually, that's pretty much it."
3652460,3655220," Uh, no frameworks except in cursors."
3655220,3662000," But in cursors, we're using just, like, move the cursor to x, y, and put a character in there."
3662080,3663700," That's the only thing we use in there."
3663700,3673160," That's really strange."
3673160,3676600," It's just, like, it's difficult for me to believe that it's that simple."
3676600,3678800," Um, all right."
3678800,3683900," So, maybe I'm gonna make a small break, because I want to make a cup of tea."
3683900,3687660," So, let's make a small break."
3687660,3690560," All right."
3690560,3691300," Let's continue."
3692080,3704020," Um, so, if this thing exists, um, hmm, let me go to all of the key current."
3704020,3710840," Uh, so, we provide the key current, and if this thing was not consumed, we take it out."
3710840,3712260," Uh-huh."
3712260,3715440," And here, we probably have to take it out as well."
3715600,3719960," So, take, and just map this entire thing like that."
3719960,3722340," X as U8 as character."
3722340,3723200," There we go."
3726500,3730380," So, uh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, let me see."
3730380,3734240," Well, to be fair, um..."
3738320,3748620," Uh, if we don't know any of these characters, maybe we shouldn't take them, per se."
3748620,3751900," Uh, but maybe we should."
3751980,3755880," I don't know, it's kind of, it's kind of difficult to tell if we have to take them or not."
3755880,3758560," Uh, so, it's gonna be key current."
3758560,3759820," All right."
3759820,3761980," So, and in here..."
3761980,3765120," Uh, hello, cozy white bear."
3765120,3766000," Welcome to the stream."
3766000,3766920," Welcome, welcome, welcome."
3768400,3770480," So, maybe this one has to be take."
3770480,3773820," Yeah, I guess, I guess it makes sense to make it a stake."
3773820,3776940," Uh, all right."
3776940,3778520," Mm-mm-mm."
3778520,3782800," Uh, this one is take."
3782800,3784200," Uh-huh."
3784200,3785480," There we go."
3785480,3787040," Key current."
3787040,3790520," And in here, I have to take it."
3790520,3792620," Uh-huh."
3792620,3796220," And we don't need to do that."
3796220,3797220," Um."
3798400,3801840," Okay, current."
3801840,3803980," Uh-huh."
3803980,3806300," So, this one is take it."
3806300,3808480," Mm-hmm."
3808480,3815160," That means in that mode you can..."
3815160,3816840," Okay, that makes sense."
3816840,3819080," Then you..."
3819080,3820180," Yeah, here's the problem."
3820180,3821520," You always take it."
3821520,3821960," Nah."
3821960,3824040," All right."
3824040,3827920," The problem here is that we should not take it"
3827920,3829260," if it's not..."
3829260,3831300," Um..."
3831300,3835420," If it's not handleable."
3835420,3836800," If it's not one of those..."
3836800,3838780," So, basically, in here, we need to put it back."
3838780,3839600," Right."
3839600,3840380," So, we take it."
3840380,3841420," We need to take a look at it."
3841420,3842900," And then we need to put it back."
3842900,3844840," And that's what makes it kind of meh."
3844840,3847740," That's what makes it kind of meh."
3848000,3850040," And that's what breaks everything, as well."
3850040,3852440," Unfortunately."
3852440,3854380," I don't know how to do that easily."
3854380,3862300," So, because I don't want to copy-paste, like, taking the key in each individual branch in here."
3862300,3869020," So, maybe in the default branch, I'm going to be putting it back in here or whatnot."
3869880,3871800," So, I'm not quite sure."
3871800,3874300," But, to be fair, we have this thing."
3874300,3876140," Maybe I can put it back."
3876140,3882720," Well, it is a genius tune, to be fair."
3882720,3889760," There is a reason why the Russian government decided to reuse the same anthem, but with different lyrics."
3890220,3892960," Because it's a pretty catchy anthem, not going to lie."
3892960,3898220," So, does it have, like, something like put?"
3898220,3901480," Oh, there's an insert, if I remember correctly."
3901480,3901740," Right?"
3901740,3902840," So, there's an insert."
3902840,3906580," That's, yeah, maybe not."
3906580,3908740," All right."
3908740,3909360," Here's an idea."
3909360,3910480," So, you take it out."
3910480,3912400," You check if it fits."
3912400,3915620," But if it doesn't fit, we have to put it back."
3915620,3916820," Yeah, that's going to be the idea."
3916820,3918220," So, it's going to be key current."
3918220,3919960," Some key."
3920220,3921240," You see what we're doing here?"
3921240,3921780," Right."
3921780,3924360," So, we take this thing, check it."
3924360,3926040," We didn't recognize it."
3926040,3930580," We put it back for the rest of the code to handle it, in case it wants to."
3930580,3931440," Right."
3931440,3932980," Key current."
3932980,3935100," The same thing is going to be here, as well."
3935100,3936260," So, we check it."
3936260,3938820," And, in case if it didn't work, we're going to put it back."
3938820,3941000," So, there's going to be some key."
3941000,3943100," Key current."
3943100,3944280," Right."
3944280,3946300," So, here we're checking if it's key."
3946300,3948680," Yeah, we're going to do that."
3948740,3950320," Otherwise, maybe we want to put it back."
3950320,3952040," Maybe not."
3952040,3954920," So, at the end, we want to consume it anyway."
3954920,3955460," Right."
3955460,3957140," At the end, we want to consume it anyway."
3957140,3959420," Hmm."
3959420,3961540," All right."
3961540,3964420," So, this one is a little bit weird."
3964420,3966380," And also, error porn."
3966380,3970360," But maybe we can come up with a good solution in the end."
3970780,3971840," So, I can press Q."
3971840,3972600," Nothing is happening."
3972600,3973240," But it breaks Q."
3973240,3973500," Okay."
3973500,3975000," That's goddamn fucking perfect."
3975000,3977100," All right."
3977100,3980300," So, then I can try to edit this thing."
3980300,3981200," And there we go."
3981200,3983240," So, here's the interesting thing."
3983240,3987720," I'm not going to render the cursor right now or anything like that."
3987780,3989720," I'm going to try to do the following thing."
3989720,3999600," In the editor mode, right, in the editor mode, if you have a key, right, if you have a key."
3999600,4005820," So, we're going to do something like if key take, right."
4005880,4008620," So, it's going to be let some key."
4008620,4009580," There we go."
4009580,4015420," And if that key is ASCII, right."
4015420,4017020," How can we check if it's ASCII?"
4017020,4025180," I suppose we can check if key, maybe something like 32, 27 contains key, right."
4025180,4026940," If this thing is contained in there."
4026940,4033240," Somebody just told me."
4033240,4033460," Okay."
4035460,4036480," Once, I'm sorry."
4036480,4038540," I'm not really familiar with means."
4038540,4049920," So, now, essentially, what we want to do, we want to take the buffer and we want to push this thing as a new character."
4049920,4053500," So, can I really push a new character into a string?"
4053500,4057540," I think I should be able to as a character."
4057540,4058140," There we go."
4058140,4061020," So, that's pretty pog."
4061020,4064540," Unfortunately, enter."
4065040,4068120," I think enter is considered to be..."
4068120,4069820," Maybe not, actually."
4069820,4070460," Maybe it's not."
4070460,4071340," So, it shouldn't be that."
4071340,4072420," Yeah."
4072420,4074700," So, key."
4074700,4078440," Expected reference."
4078440,4078860," All right."
4078860,4080120," So, what if I..."
4080120,4081500," Yeah."
4081500,4082820," I need to dereference this thing."
4086220,4089520," Type I32 cannot be dereferenced."
4089520,4093960," So, let's call it key current."
4093960,4094680," All right."
4094680,4096080," So, this is a key current."
4096080,4097900," Key current."
4097900,4099140," And I take it."
4099140,4103000," Then, maybe it will finally work."
4103000,4107860," Consider it boring."
4108120,4108820," Oh, yeah."
4108820,4112660," I just didn't expect that contains would take it as a reference."
4112660,4112980," Okay."
4112980,4116100," So, that's why I couldn't properly process it."
4116100,4116300," Okay."
4116300,4117520," So, now, look, look, look."
4117520,4118780," Wait a second."
4118780,4120960," Let me get rid of the stuff we need to do."
4121960,4124060," Now, I select a particular item."
4124060,4126160," I get into the editing mode."
4126160,4128640," And..."
4128640,4129080," Okay."
4129080,4131140," Enter, apparently, is considered..."
4131140,4134640," Is considered the ASCII."
4134640,4137120," So, maybe we need to exclude the stuff."
4138120,4139660," So, I suppose..."
4139660,4141040," Return is 10."
4141040,4143180," Isn't it?"
4143180,4144820," Well, yeah."
4144820,4147000," Return is 10."
4147000,4148280," How did it even consume it?"
4148280,4148940," Ah!"
4148940,4150240," Because it didn't put it back."
4150240,4150540," Okay."
4150540,4152680," Edit field."
4152680,4154520," Wait a second."
4154520,4155340," Right."
4155340,4156340," Otherwise..."
4156340,4158300," Right."
4158300,4159340," Otherwise..."
4159340,4160740," I want to put it back."
4160740,4163500," So, it's going to be key current."
4163500,4164840," Just put back."
4168120,4173920," It has to be some..."
4173920,4176960," Isn't that paradigm of, like, you know, taking and putting back?"
4176960,4178460," I don't think it works really well."
4178460,4179380," But, look."
4179380,4180720," Yeah."
4180720,4184560," I can now at least append things into the current elements."
4184560,4188300," And if I quit, it actually saves everything automatically."
4188300,4191340," So, yep."
4191340,4197760," So, it kind of works."
4198120,4199680," If you think about it."
4199680,4201460," So..."
4201460,4203420," It's pretty cool."
4203420,4218880," So, we also need to render the cursor, I suppose."
4218880,4221700," So, let me see how we can do that."
4222360,4228300," So, first of all, I want to check if the cursor is within the range of the buffer, right?"
4228300,4233260," If the cursor is greater or equal than the buffer length, we can do the following thing."
4233260,4237200," We're going to set the cursor to buffer length minus one."
4237200,4238100," But here's the problem."
4238100,4239700," Buffer length could be..."
4239700,4245880," Could be equal to zero, right?"
4245880,4249180," So, if it's equal to zero, what are we going to be doing?"
4249180,4251620," I don't know."
4251620,4256760," And buffer len is greater than zero."
4256760,4259580," Only then we're going to be setting it to, like, minus one in here."
4260360,4260880," All right."
4260880,4265060," So, the next thing we can do in here, we can just render the syntax thing."
4265060,4279380," But now, we also need to find the specific character within that label and render that character with a different color to indicate the cursor."
4280700,4281140," Right."
4281140,4285620," So, we could probably reuse the cursor from the end curses, right?"
4285620,4288120," But I find it difficult to work with that cursor."
4288120,4291080," It's easier to actually emulate the cursor yourself."
4291080,4292820," At least, that's my experience."
4292820,4294160," So, maybe you had a better experience."
4294160,4294560," I don't know."
4294560,4301900," So, in here, maybe what we can do, we can actually render everything ourselves, if you know what I'm talking about."
4302700,4305960," So, here we have a..."
4305960,4309460," Here we take the layout, right?"
4309460,4313360," And then we take a position, then we move to that position, and we render the text."
4313360,4317640," And then we add ourselves."
4317640,4323240," And then we add ourselves."
4323240,4327440," So, maybe this is going to be literally the same thing."
4327440,4328780," Right."
4328780,4329920," All right."
4329920,4330560," Let's give it a try."
4330840,4334220," Let's actually, like, literally copy-paste this thing."
4334220,4339840," So, this is going to be the layout."
4339840,4342700," Trying to render edit field."
4342700,4345120," Edit field outside of any layout."
4345120,4346000," This is a problem."
4346000,4349660," Then we're moving to a particular position."
4349660,4351440," We're using the regular player, though."
4351440,4352880," Right."
4352880,4354700," So, this is going to be a regular player."
4354700,4356980," All right."
4356980,4359360," Then we're rendering the buffer, I suppose."
4359620,4361120," Here's the buffer that we're rendering."
4361120,4364300," And then we're adding the width."
4364300,4365080," Right."
4365080,4368160," And we don't need to do this kind of stuff anymore."
4368160,4368620," Now..."
4370000,4373060," So, this one is essentially the field itself."
4373060,4373700," Right."
4373700,4378960," Field itself."
4378960,4381480," So, and we need to introduce the cursor."
4381480,4382040," Right."
4382040,4383620," So, now we need to render the cursor."
4387620,4391940," So, maybe in here, I'm going to be doing something like this."
4391940,4409580," Though, honestly, we're going to have moved this kind of stuff somewhere."
4411580,4413800," Here, because it's related to the field."
4413800,4414380," Right."
4414380,4416040," Because we're updating the field itself."
4416040,4421620," Maybe this one is going to be buffer."
4421620,4423360," This is the buffer."
4423360,4424940," And this is the cursor."
4424940,4428520," So, I'm going to be moving to the position Y."
4428880,4433120," But in terms of position X, it's going to be essentially position X plus the cursor."
4433120,4434680," Right."
4434680,4442200," And in here, we're going to simply enable the highlighted pair."
4442200,4442640," Right."
4442680,4444060," So, this is the highlighted pair."
4444060,4450200," Then, we're going to render the single character."
4450200,4459260," So, and this is where we want to do the following thing."
4459260,4462220," I'm going to try to get the cursor."
4462220,4464460," I wonder if it's going to work or not."
4464460,4464960," We'll see."
4464960,4465300," We'll see."
4469720,4473060," Then, I'm going to disable the highlighted pair."
4473060,4481060," Okay."
4481060,4486260," So, let's go to the compilation errors and see how it's going to work now."
4486260,4489320," All right."
4489320,4489860," Move."
4489860,4490920," Was it not move?"
4490920,4491800," It was MV."
4491800,4495420," It was MV."
4498420,4499860," So, buffer length."
4499860,4505240," So, buffer is expected to use size, but got."
4505240,4508100," Wait."
4508100,4508320," What?"
4508320,4511160," Why would you expect?"
4511160,4512680," Oh, this is because."
4512680,4512940," Okay."
4512940,4516000," So, that means I have to do something like this, I suppose."
4516000,4516260," Right."
4516260,4521360," And I also have to dereference this stuff."
4521360,4523580," Expected I33."
4523580,4524020," Okay."
4524200,4526380," So, maybe I can convert it to I32."
4526380,4528580," Let me see."
4528580,4529100," Let me see."
4529100,4530700," And here's the cursor."
4530700,4533300," So, if I do something like this."
4533300,4537060," String indices are ranges of view size."
4537060,4537420," Okay."
4537420,4542480," So, can I take only a single character?"
4542480,4548400," So, I want to take a look at this string."
4548400,4552120," Or maybe string slice or str or something."
4552120,4556740," So, std str."
4556740,4561580," So, can I get some stuff in there?"
4566260,4567580," This is not particularly confusing."
4567580,4568520," Oh, this is the module."
4568520,4568920," Oh, my God."
4568920,4569880," This is so confusing."
4569880,4572520," All right."
4572520,4576360," Documentation of Rust is really, really confusing."
4576360,4578820," Okay."
4578820,4581660," But I suppose you just get used to it over time, right?"
4581660,4584460," You just get used to it over time."
4589460,4590960," So, this is the boundaries."
4590960,4595640," Well, I guess."
4595640,4599900," So, this thing should return, like, another slice, right?"
4599900,4601180," It should return another slice."
4601180,4602980," And maybe this is what we want to do in here."
4602980,4604620," So, just cursor plus one."
4604620,4605940," All right."
4605940,4612260," So, because I want to treat this entire thing as the, yeah."
4612440,4615880," Maybe we can do equal there, right?"
4615880,4618740," Expected found option."
4618740,4622600," And this entire thing, actually, yeah, has an option."
4622600,4626660," So, maybe because of that, I'm going to do it like this."
4626660,4631040," If let some x, right?"
4631040,4633300," I'm not sure what the hell is going to be there here."
4633300,4634580," Right."
4634580,4636320," And we're going to use this x like that."
4636320,4638740," And it's working."
4638740,4639000," Okay."
4639000,4645120," So, I'm not sure how much of a code this, how good this code is."
4645120,4647940," But maybe, oh, you can even do it like that."
4647940,4648400," That's perfect."
4648400,4651220," So, I only want you to get, like, one character, but as a string."
4651220,4662660," So, it looks good to me."
4662660,4665800," And it's also really safe."
4665800,4666840," Am I right?"
4668360,4668800," Okay."
4668800,4678040," So, now, if I go into the insert mode, you can see, you can clearly see the cursor."
4678040,4679940," So, yeah."
4679940,4682320," That's pretty cool, isn't it?"
4682320,4683440," I think it's pretty cool."
4683440,4687720," So, let me remove this kind of stuff."
4688320,4691680," And I think when we go into the editor mode, right?"
4691680,4694400," When we enable editing, right?"
4694400,4696780," We enable editing equal to true, right?"
4696780,4697900," So, this is where we do that."
4698940,4707540," I think I need to set the cursor to the end, if you know what I mean, to the end of the current element."
4707540,4711320," But I'm not sure how to properly do that, honestly."
4713960,4721480," So, maybe if we moved I to the place where we handle all of that, if you know what I mean."
4721480,4730040," So, essentially, if you're not in the editing mode, but the current key that is pressed is I, you switch to the editing mode."
4730600,4734780," And you set the cursor to the end of the current element because you have the current element in here."
4734780,4737280," That is goddamn fucking cool."
4737280,4738600," I think that's a pretty cool idea."
4738600,4741360," So, we can move this thing in here."
4741360,4742840," Cool."
4742840,4744260," Can I try to do that?"
4745360,4751420," So, essentially, if let's sum key, equal key current."
4751420,4758200," So, it's going to be like that."
4758200,4764500," And if, might as well actually map this entire thing."
4764500,4769060," So, it's going to be map x, x as you add as character."
4769060,4774200," And if this entire thing is equal to I, we're switching to the editor."
4774900,4775380," All right."
4775380,4777920," But on top of that, I'm also..."
4777920,4778840," The fuck was that?"
4778840,4783940," I'm also taking the current element and I'm setting the cursor to this thing, to the end."
4783940,4784580," Right."
4784580,4787100," And because of this stuff, I don't need to do that stuff."
4787100,4792300," And I'm setting this stuff to none because I consumed it."
4792300,4792940," Right."
4792940,4794140," I think I need to get rid of the take."
4794140,4797060," I don't like the take because it makes it more difficult."
4797060,4798200," Right."
4798200,4800360," So, I'm doing everything immediately."
4800360,4800740," Okay."
4800740,4803560," I know that the to-do is active right now."
4803760,4805360," I'm iterating through all of the elements."
4805360,4809920," If I found the currently selected element and I'm in the editing mode, I do as an editor."
4809920,4813100," If I'm not in the editing mode, I don't render it as an editor."
4813280,4817560," But if I pressed I, I have an access to the current element."
4817560,4821920," So, for me, it's a no-brainer to just take the links of that element and set it to the editing cursor."
4822760,4823260," All right."
4823260,4825200," So, it's sort of like a decision tree."
4825200,4831600," You're constantly traversing the decision tree and you have all the necessary information immediately."
4833280,4833680," All right."
4833680,4833760," All right."
4833760,4834940," That's, that's really cool."
4834940,4838900," And as I consume, and as I consume this entire thing, it's just like, yeah."
4838900,4841860," I don't know."
4845780,4850780," The only problem with this code is that it goes against all the conventional wisdom."
4850780,4853700," So, that's the only problem with this, with this code."
4853700,4855900," Apart from that, it's actually fucking perfect."
4855900,4858160," It works well."
4858160,4859280," And, yeah."
4860860,4866240," Once you wrap your head around this concept of immediate UI, it's actually quite pleasant to work with."
4866240,4867240," Almost like Rust."
4867240,4868840," You just have to get used to it."
4868840,4869660," It's not annoying."
4869660,4871080," You just have to get used to it."
4871080,4871340," Okay?"
4871340,4872340," Right."
4872340,4874940," So, just give it some time and you will get used to it."
4874940,4878980," So, I'm going to use the arguments of Rust Community against them."
4878980,4879520," All right."
4879520,4885440," So, just need to get some time and you'll get used to it."
4890860,4894360," All right."
4894360,4903060," So, now, if I run this entire thing, right, as you can see, the cursor is at the end of the editing."
4903060,4904360," Right."
4904360,4906900," So, it's at the end of the editing all the time."
4906900,4913380," So, here, I cannot go into the editing mode, but in here, I can actually, well, yeah, it depends at the end of it."
4913380,4920440," To be fair, maybe we should allow the cursor to be sort of like bigger."
4920860,4925280," Yeah, sort of like bigger."
4925280,4927540," Am I in the wrong?"
4927540,4928740," Yeah, I'm in the wrong here."
4928740,4932600," So, I suppose I need to set it to actually LAN."
4932600,4936780," All right, all right, all right."
4936780,4938200," And let me see."
4938200,4940820," And it didn't work, surprisingly."
4940820,4941720," Huh."
4941720,4944760," Editing cursor."
4944760,4946840," Hmm."
4946840,4948900," Did it actually rebuild everything?"
4949000,4951680," It should have actually rebuild everything, but it didn't set anything."
4951680,4953300," This is annoying."
4953300,4954480," Oh, I know why."
4954480,4957120," Because I'm a dummy."
4957120,4960640," Cursor."
4960640,4961360," Yeah."
4961360,4967480," So, I think the cursor should be allowed to be one character further."
4967480,4969920," I think the cursor should be allowed to be there."
4970640,4974680," If it's greater, right, we can set it back to the LAN."
4974680,4979100," And because of that, we don't even need to check this kind of stuff."
4979100,4979920," There we go."
4979920,4981220," That's fucking perfect, mate."
4984440,4987380," So, let's continue."
4987380,4995220," So, in here is this stuff."
4995220,5006680," I suppose one thing we can do in here is just put it like that and get or else, right?"
5006780,5009700," Is it get or else or something else?"
5009700,5010200," I don't remember."
5010200,5012160," So, this is going to be option."
5012160,5018160," Get or insert."
5018160,5022740," Wait, what?"
5022740,5024120," Is that really option?"
5024120,5025860," I don't recognize this option."
5025860,5026340," What the hell?"
5028260,5029480," Is it or else?"
5029480,5031160," I think it's or else."
5031160,5033540," Default."
5033540,5035260," Maybe it's a default or else."
5035260,5038300," Wait."
5038300,5040160," Is it unwrap or else?"
5040160,5041140," Unwrap or else."
5041140,5041640," Oh, my God."
5041640,5042420," Unwrap or."
5042420,5042940," Okay."
5042940,5044340," Jesus Christ."
5044340,5046720," Unwrap or."
5046720,5049400," And it's going to be just, you know, empty thing."
5049400,5054100," So, something like this."
5054100,5058460," So, if the cursor overflows, it's going to be just like, you know, space in there."
5058460,5060860," Let's see how it goes."
5060860,5065480," And, yeah, there we go."
5065480,5067160," So, as you can see, it's at the end of this thing."
5067160,5067840," And, yeah."
5067840,5069380," So, now what I want to do."
5069380,5074380," Essentially, I don't want to insert at the end."
5074380,5077720," I want to insert at the current cursor."
5077720,5078960," That's what I want to do."
5080860,5085760," And, because of that, this entire thing could be extremely annoying."
5085760,5089960," Because the buffer is a string."
5089960,5096760," As far as I know, in a string, you cannot just, like, insert things."
5096760,5097600," Can you?"
5097600,5098380," Right?"
5098380,5100420," Because it's, like, UTF encoded."
5100420,5102140," And it's, like, really, really annoying."
5102140,5105240," I think I remember that one."
5105240,5105920," Yes, yes."
5105920,5107800," Can you just insert something in?"
5107800,5108260," Okay."
5108260,5109700," You can insert str."
5110200,5110480," Okay."
5110480,5111240," All right."
5111240,5111480," Right."
5111480,5112600," So, that's pretty cool."
5112600,5114680," This is an OIL operation."
5114680,5116360," It requires copying every element in the buffer."
5116360,5116680," All right."
5116680,5117480," That's fine."
5117480,5120420," So, I suppose it's going to re-encode everything appropriately."
5120420,5124820," And the index is larger."
5124820,5126760," So, I think we can work with that."
5126760,5130880," Can I remove a particular thing in here?"
5130880,5132740," So, we can remove a particular index."
5132740,5133600," All right."
5133600,5134900," I think we can work with that."
5134900,5136180," I think we can work with that."
5136180,5138860," Specifically, we can insert a character."
5138860,5139360," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
5139360,5140140," That's perfect."
5140140,5141560," That is absolutely perfect."
5141560,5143480," Into the string."
5143480,5147440," So, O of N is actually acceptable in this particular situation."
5147440,5150340," Because we're dealing with a very small N."
5150340,5151360," Right?"
5152040,5153860," We're dealing with a very small N."
5153860,5157620," So, because it's like a string that the user edits."
5157620,5162680," A user is not going to edit like, you know, millions of characters in a single edit field."
5162680,5163120," All right."
5163120,5165540," So, it's not a thing that we have to worry about."
5166700,5169440," Unless you're making an actual text editor."
5169440,5171260," But we're not making an actual text editor."
5171260,5173900," All right."
5173900,5178380," So, let me try to do it like that."
5178380,5180060," So, this is a key."
5184480,5187620," And if the key was properly handled."
5187620,5192720," Maybe I'm going to actually keep it like that."
5192720,5193220," I'm not sure."
5193220,5196340," All right."
5196340,5200240," So, instead of pushing, I need to check where the cursor is at."
5200360,5208660," If the cursor is greater or equal to the buffer LEN."
5208660,5211240," If it's greater or equal to the buffer LEN."
5211240,5214840," We're going to be just pushing the character at the end of the buffer."
5214840,5217860," Otherwise, I think we need to insert it."
5217860,5220780," So, insert the character into the byte position."
5220780,5222900," So, effectively."
5222900,5223640," Yeah."
5223640,5225300," That's precisely what we want."
5225300,5228400," But on top of that, we also want to increment the cursor."
5228400,5228900," Don't we?"
5229580,5231500," I think we want to increment it in both of the situations."
5231500,5233300," So, it's going to be cursor plus one."
5233300,5240600," And here, we're going to be doing insert key as you ate as character."
5240600,5242100," And just increment the cursor."
5242100,5244460," So, yeah."
5244460,5245980," First, you have to provide the index."
5245980,5247680," And the index is literally the cursor."
5247680,5250420," And then, we're incrementing it."
5250420,5250620," Okay."
5250620,5253040," That's basically what we want to have in here."
5253040,5253380," Right."
5253380,5254540," Basically."
5254540,5256940," All right."
5256940,5257820," It still compiles."
5258200,5261540," And now, if I enter this thing, I still can append things."
5261540,5263640," But now, here's the cool part."
5263640,5267140," If I set the cursor not at the end."
5267140,5267860," Right."
5267860,5269540," So, cursor equal."
5269540,5270460," Right."
5270460,5273120," You see, as we enter the editing mode, we set it to the end."
5273120,5274460," What if I set it to zero?"
5274460,5275100," Right."
5275460,5276960," So, is it going to work properly?"
5276960,5280500," Right now, we cannot control the thing."
5280500,5282460," But we're going to be able to do that soon."
5282460,5283680," Okay."
5283680,5286260," So, I can insert, add the cursor position."
5286260,5287840," So, that's pretty cool."
5287840,5289740," Yep."
5291020,5291960," I think that's pretty cool."
5291960,5298120," All right."
5298120,5302260," So, the only thing that is left, we need to be able to control the cursor."
5302260,5302780," Right."
5302780,5304300," So, we need to be able to control the cursor."
5304300,5305320," How are we going to do that?"
5305320,5306380," That's a very good question."
5308760,5311900," So, I think we need to be able to handle, like, arrows."
5311900,5314700," But I think, to handle the arrows."
5314700,5315600," Hmm."
5315600,5317880," This one is going to be very interesting."
5317880,5321080," Because if I press the arrow."
5321080,5322120," Right."
5322120,5324780," So, arrows are not even handled in any way."
5324780,5328240," So, let me go somewhere here."
5328240,5334100," So, I'm taking it in here."
5334100,5336240," So, I can try to do something like this."
5336440,5341240," If let some key, key current."
5341240,5341800," Right."
5341800,5342460," Key current."
5342460,5344560," And I'm going to go to the to-do's."
5344560,5346900," And I'm going to push the key here."
5346900,5347320," All right."
5347320,5348520," So, it's going to be something like that."
5348520,5350000," Key."
5350000,5351560," Key."
5351560,5353940," And do I need to put it like that?"
5353940,5354560," No, probably not."
5354560,5355660," Okay."
5355660,5357500," Let me try to run it."
5357500,5358880," And, all right."
5358880,5359960," So, we press down."
5359960,5360220," Yeah."
5360220,5364840," So, this is a very special key that actually generates a sequence of keys."
5364840,5365220," Right."
5365220,5367240," So, it also first key is 27."
5367240,5368680," Which is an escape sequence."
5368680,5370460," And so on and so forth."
5370460,5371960," So, it's kind of annoying."
5371960,5372240," Yeah."
5372240,5373180," I do remember that."
5373180,5374140," I do remember that."
5374140,5374680," Yeah."
5374680,5376240," Yeah."
5376240,5377960," It is what it is."
5377960,5379180," And it isn't what it isn't."
5379180,5381160," So, the thing is."
5381160,5384500," Maybe we need to enable the keypad."
5384500,5386020," So, this can be in cursus."
5386020,5388080," Keypad."
5388080,5400100," So, maybe I'm going to actually go to crates."
5400100,5405460," And find in cursus because I want to find the commutation."
5407300,5410580," I want to find the commutation of our nation."
5410580,5413640," Where's the commutation?"
5413640,5414860," Where's the commutation?"
5414860,5416260," Okay."
5416260,5419200," So, maybe I can just do something like locally."
5419200,5421520," Cargo docks open."
5421520,5422840," Dock."
5422840,5423620," Single one."
5425480,5427100," Could have actually supported both of them."
5427100,5432800," There's no reason to not support both of these things and having them as in aliases."
5432800,5433440," But, I mean."
5433440,5436040," Ross needs to be annoying."
5436040,5438520," If it's not annoying, what's the point?"
5438520,5439360," Am I right?"
5441920,5443440," So, this is in cursus."
5443440,5445480," So, I want to take a look at the keypad."
5445480,5447600," Right."
5447600,5448860," So, this is a keypad."
5448860,5449660," And, okay."
5449660,5456960," Keypad."
5456960,5457720," STD."
5457720,5458360," Screw."
5458360,5460660," And this one is going to be true."
5460660,5461720," Right."
5461720,5466300," Oh, this is not that I wanted, actually."
5466300,5467300," I wanted to rebuild."
5470520,5471040," All right."
5471040,5472240," So, it seems to be working."
5472240,5475540," And I think I need to clean up my to-do."
5475540,5477300," All right."
5477300,5477780," So."
5477780,5481140," Excuse me."
5481140,5482740," Ah."
5482740,5484620," All right."
5484620,5485540," Okay."
5485540,5490660," So, now, if I press down, it's a single key in here."
5490660,5490940," Okay."
5490940,5491660," That's perfect."
5491660,5493180," That's a single key in here."
5493180,5497800," So, but does it preserve the ASCII stuff?"
5497800,5497980," Yeah."
5497980,5499280," It does preserve the ASCII stuff."
5499280,5499900," That's perfect."
5500520,5504940," So, but on top of that, we can also try to handle the arrows and whatnot."
5504940,5507260," That's actually pretty cool."
5507260,5508460," All right."
5508460,5510320," Let's also handle the arrows."
5510320,5514340," So, this one is going to be edit field."
5514340,5514940," Right."
5514940,5515840," It's going to be edit field."
5517740,5519280," So, if it's that."
5519280,5523680," So, if it's that, you put it back."
5523680,5530320," And in here, we handle the cursor first."
5530580,5539560," And then, if let some key current take."
5539560,5546600," So, is there something like left cursor?"
5546600,5547420," Okay."
5547420,5548340," This one is interesting."
5548340,5549200," It's a term."
5549260,5550500," No, it's not what I want."
5550500,5552060," Key left."
5552060,5552440," Okay."
5552440,5554020," So, it's in cursor's constants."
5554020,5556040," One handed."
5556040,5557760," Four."
5557760,5562200," So, if I take a look at the decimal representation of these things."
5562200,5562680," It's 260."
5562680,5564680," And that's precisely what we saw in there."
5564680,5567660," Left key."
5567660,5568340," But left."
5569920,5570300," Yes."
5570300,5573820," Right."
5573820,5575900," No, there's no right in here."
5575900,5578040," Okay."
5578040,5583020," So, I just actually imported the entire encurses."
5583020,5587080," Match key."
5587080,5588060," Right."
5588060,5590500," And if this thing is a constant."
5590500,5594820," Key left."
5594820,5595800," Right."
5595800,5596980," So, we're going to do one thing."
5597800,5602120," I suppose if cursor is greater than zero."
5602120,5603980," I'm just decrementing the cursor."
5603980,5604380," Right."
5604380,5604880," By one."
5604880,5607960," So, then constants key right."
5607960,5609240," Right."
5609240,5609860," Key right."
5609860,5617740," If cursor is less than buffer length."
5617740,5620500," Then we are incrementing the cursor."
5620500,5622120," By one."
5622120,5622720," There we go."
5622720,5624080," And that should be it."
5627680,5631300," So, and if none of these things are recognized."
5631300,5633580," I actually put the key back."
5633580,5634440," Right."
5634440,5635660," So, it's going to be key current."
5635660,5636980," Some key."
5636980,5637620," Right."
5637620,5639140," So, I took the key."
5639140,5640380," I checked the key."
5640380,5640900," Okay."
5640900,5642200," This is not the key that I recognize."
5642200,5642820," I put it back."
5642820,5646540," So, because then later somebody else can handle it."
5646540,5648240," That's the idea in here."
5648240,5653160," So, I definitely need to come up with a better paradigm of handling this kind of situation."
5653160,5653840," Taking the key."
5653840,5654400," Checking it."
5654400,5656120," And if it's not the key I care about."
5656120,5656700," Put it back."
5656700,5660000," Maybe we can come up with some sort of like functions that makes it easier."
5660000,5661480," We'll see."
5661480,5661840," We'll see."
5661840,5666920," Compiles."
5666920,5667920," First try, by the way."
5674000,5680760," What's interesting is that every time I find Rust annoying, I'm not even fighting with a borrowchecker."
5680760,5685700," I don't remember when was the last time that borrowchecker annoyed me."
5685700,5688740," Borrowchecker is not the most annoying part of the language."
5688740,5693320," It's like these small little things that are overlooked by the designers of the language."
5693460,5694680," And it's just like a lot of them."
5694680,5698920," And it's just like a death by the thousands of paper cuts."
5698920,5701200," Hello, RDB42."
5701200,5701920," Welcome, welcome."
5701920,5706580," How much time you spend on coding daily?"
5706580,5707320," I don't count."
5707320,5707780," I'm sorry."
5708640,5711140," I have zero statistics on that."
5711140,5715200," All right."
5715200,5718180," Okay."
5718180,5719760," So, let me see."
5719760,5723180," So, now we should be able to control the keys."
5723180,5723620," Right."
5723760,5726560," So, and yeah, everything seems to be okay."
5726560,5727460," All right."
5727460,5734540," Tell me that this is not a God Cudder moment."
5734540,5747840," Well, I mean, we have to remove this shit, but I mean, it works."
5747840,5752440," So, yeah, that's very cool."
5753640,5754960," That's actually pretty straightforward."
5754960,5755820," Holy shit."
5755820,5757840," I can remove some."
5757840,5759200," Can I remove some?"
5759200,5760100," Why can't I remove?"
5760100,5760780," Oh, yeah."
5760780,5761500," I remember."
5761500,5761860," Yeah."
5761860,5763500," I need to move them here."
5763500,5765860," And then you can remove them into the abyss."
5765860,5769380," Write to do app in Rust."
5769380,5770160," Right."
5770160,5771820," And you can modify this kind of shit now."
5771820,5775120," You can't remove the characters, though, but we can easily implement that."
5782260,5784640," The most problem in Rust is no default traits."
5784640,5788380," Well, this is one of the small, annoying things that I'm talking about."
5788380,5789780," Like, it's only one of them."
5789780,5795320," But as you try to apply Rust in different situations, in more different areas and stuff like that,"
5795320,5799980," you discover more and more of these small, annoying things, and they pile up."
5800760,5806200," So, the annoyance of the Rust doesn't come from the place where Rust people claim it coming from."
5806200,5808580," It's not coming from the borrow checker."
5808580,5810020," It's not coming from lifetimes."
5810020,5812280," No, it's actually a pretty cool thing."
5812280,5817080," It's just like the whole language is just like, there's a lot of overlooked things that are..."
5817080,5820720," And, I don't know, it's really annoying."
5823460,5839680," The only thing in Rust that is more important than safe code is the only person that writes in it."
5839680,5839900," Yeah."
5839900,5846900," And those annoying things have nothing to do with safety whatsoever."
5846900,5849480," Like, yeah, it's just like, holy shit."
5849480,5857120," It's like a pile of features that are thrown together without any consideration how these features fit together."
5857120,5859300," All right."
5859300,5861980," So, let's continue."
5861980,5863200," All right."
5863200,5872820," But remember, guys, you just have to get used to it."
5872820,5874440," And then, it's just like..."
5874440,5876400," Anyway."
5876900,5895380," I'm just thinking, what if I got to do, actually?"
5895380,5896380," What if I got to..."
5896380,5902140," Oh, yeah."
5902140,5904420," I want you to delete this stuff."
5904420,5905980," So, do I have a delete?"
5906900,5908080," Key in here."
5908080,5911820," And cursors delete in."
5911820,5912560," Okay."
5912560,5915680," So, let me see how I can approach this entire thing."
5919540,5924260," So, if let some key, key current."
5924260,5924820," All right."
5924820,5926120," So, this is the key current."
5926120,5930800," And, to do push format."
5930800,5933080," All right."
5933080,5934440," This is going to be that stuff."
5934440,5936040," And key."
5936040,5937980," All right."
5937980,5938580," There we go."
5943920,5944460," All right."
5944460,5944480," All right."
5944480,5944480," All right."
5944480,5945820," So, if I press delete."
5945820,5947400," Really?"
5947400,5948240," What is it good?"
5948240,5950160," Okay."
5950160,5951400," So, apparently..."
5951400,5954620," Hmm."
5954620,5958920," Okay."
5958920,5959700," Just a second."
5960700,5964760," I need to move this thing probably somewhere here."
5964760,5967480," Because I want to see what delete looks like."
5967480,5975580," Wait."
5975580,5975900," What?"
5981840,6011760," is really confusing. 130. But why don't we have"
6011760,6020800," a key for that in Encursus? Can I take a look at the source code of Encursus, like target?"
6020800,6027600," Probably not. Right, so is there any place where I can take a look at this stuff? So registry,"
6027600,6034400," SRC, GitHub, Encursus. Okay, that's perfect actually. That's pretty cool that I can look"
6034400,6040880," into this kind of stuff. So constants, and we have a shit ton of key constants, right? So here they are."
6041920,6051040," And there's not a single delete. Yeah, nice one. Not a single delete. And the last character in here,"
6052560,6054000," some sort of a key event."
6054000,6068960," So if I take a look at the 330 in hex, right? It was 330. Do we have 14A? It's DC. Okay. All right."
6070240,6074720," Thank you so much. That's very... Why didn't you just call it delete? Come on. Encursus."
6074720,6078400," Encursus do be like that sometimes."
6078400,6090720," All right. So constants delete, right? So it's constants key delete DC. Almost forgot, right? It has to be DC."
6092720,6099760," In fact, we might actually move this entire stuff in here, because why not. Though..."
6099760,6112000," We can try to do it like that. So match key, right? So this is going to be that. And I'm pretty sure I can match"
6113040,6128160," their range in here, right? And as we match this range, that's what we're trying to do in here, right?"
6135680,6138800," Where is my shit? I lost my shit."
6138800,6162160," Here it is. I want to comment it out. Switch, uh, match."
6162160,6181440," So this is that. And then in case of the left, right cursor, we're doing this kind of stuff, right?"
6181440,6191600," And let me just go in here. And the last one I want to handle is the delete, right? So we're trying"
6191600,6197840," to do in here. We're trying to delete the characters somewhere, uh, at the cursor specifically, right?"
6197840,6209280," So, uh, let's go over. Delete, uh, remove. Uh, so remove the character, uh, and it panics if the"
6209280,6221040," index is larger than, all right. So if a cursor is less than buffer len, the buffer, uh, remove"
6221680,6226240," the cursor, there we go. So now we should be able to handle this kind of shit."
6226240,6240080," Cool. So if it's ASCII stuff, we just put it there. I mean, if it's printable stuff left, right, uh, move"
6240080,6246720," the cursor, uh, delete, delete the character at the current cursor. And that's pretty much it, I suppose."
6246720,6253360," So here we don't really need to handle anything anymore. So the cursor could be, yeah, I think"
6253360,6259840," it's, yeah, I think it's too much. So let's actually keep it like that buffer. And then we're just rendering"
6259840,6288480," the cursor, okay, all right. So, uh, for more uniform. So, okay. Uh, exclusive"
6288480,6297360," arrange is experimental. Uh, do I have to do it like this?"
6302000,6307840," wait. Why this would be experimental, but this would be not?"
6307840,6314960," What makes it, what makes this so special? Like, excuse me?"
6322240,6330560," not knowing at all, by the way, speaking of, uh, what? Okay, sure. It's gonna be, it's gonna be fixed in"
6330560,6332880," the next nightly. Sure. Sure, buddy. Uh,"
6332880,6339360," the whole thing should, yeah, I feel like I'm an experiment. Yeah, yeah, that's, that's what it"
6339360,6344480," feels like. Every time I program an ass, I feel like I'm an experiment. Uh, all right."
6345760,6352640," Um, all right. So this, this looks fine. So I, let me double check if the, if the range is correct in"
6352640,6360640," here. 26. Okay. So delete is not printable. Um, oh, by the way, last algorithm. Hello. Hello."
6360640,6371600," Welcome to the stream. Um, okay. So let's give it a try. Uh, let's stop beating around the meat and test it out."
6372800,6383600," Got you hyper. Uh, uh, yeah. So I forgot to remove the logging. Um,"
6383600,6400720," Stop beating around the meat. Stop beating the meat. Okay. Uh, all right. So now, all right. Can I delete"
6400720,6406720," the characters now? I can, I can delete it. I can backspace them, but I can delete shit."
6406720,6416400," That's perfect. Um, okay. Bye bye, rgb42. See you around. Uh, that's pretty pogue. Not gonna lie. So how"
6416400,6430640," can we handle the backspace? Uh, uh, back space. So there is a DC, uh, I suppose. Key DC. Delete character key. And"
6430640,6441120," insert character key. Uh, delete line key. So maybe it's delete, but back delete, uh, shifted and delete line"
6441120,6460560," key. Okay. So let's enable the debug output and see, uh, what's key is that? Okay. It's 263, uh, 263. And in hex, it's 107. Uh, 107."
6460560,6462800," seven. And it's, uh, oh, it's literally backspace."
6462800,6472960," Goddamn incurses. Jebaited me. Well, because I thought that since delete is not called"
6472960,6479600," delete in, in curses, I thought that backspace is also not called backspace, but it's called backspacing."
6479600,6484480," Goddamn incurses. Okay. Uh, so."
6487040,6495360," Goddamn incurses. Literally gebaited me. Uh, so. Constance, uh, key backspace. All right. So what do we"
6495360,6505920," have in here? How can I do that? Uh, we have remove, uh, I suppose I just have to write, um,"
6505920,6520560," if the cursor, uh, if the cursor, uh, if the cursor is, uh, greater than zero, uh, what I do? I do cursor,"
6520560,6528640," uh, minus one, and then I delete the current character, right? Buffer, remove, um,"
6529280,6538720," cursor. But it only makes sense if this entire thing like sort of available,"
6538720,6546480," right? Because at some point if, yeah, just in, just in case, I think it makes sense to check that."
6548240,6560720," Uh, all right. So, uh, so, and now, okay, it works. I can, I can do that. And delete also works. Backspace"
6560720,6571920," also works. And yeah, that's pretty cool. Um, so, and let's remove the debug output, right? So,"
6571920,6580400," because it kind of ruins everything. And of course we need to get rid of that. Uh, yep, yep, yep. Buy"
6581280,6589680," white bread, uh, to do app, uh, web app, right? So, and as you can see, we can do this kind of stuff,"
6589680,6597200," make a cup of tea. And then instead of tea, we can say, make a cup of coffee, uh, and so on and so forth."
6597200,6606400," So honestly, there is a problem in here, in my opinion that, all right, uh, the prefix sort of"
6606400,6612240," disappears and it's kind of annoying. So maybe we should make the prefix sort of independent from,"
6612240,6618320," um, from the element itself, because the prefix is actually rendered, uh,"
6618320,6629280," let me show you like this. So if we create, yeah, if we create like sort of a separate layout in here"
6629280,6636080," for each individual thing, we can create a separate layout. All right. So UI, uh, begin layout and the"
6636080,6644560," layout is going to be a layout kind. Ooh, it's going to actually ruin everything. I think."
6644560,6663360," All right. So, uh, begin layout is going to be that and it's going to be horizontal layout, right? So this is"
6663360,6670480," the horizontal layout, uh, for each individual element, uh, for each individual element. And then we end"
6670480,6685680," this layout in here, uh, and layout. All right. So, and what I do in here is UI label, uh, label another one."
6686640,6696800," Uh, uh, uh, it's going to be something like that. Uh, uh, self is not needed, but the text, uh, the text is going"
6696800,6710080," to be something like this and the pair pair is greatly depends. Uh, uh, uh, that's my, that's my opinion of the situation."
6710080,6716480," This is actually kind of complex situation. So maybe, yeah, I only need to think about it more."
6716480,6723360," So maybe we need to have a better layouting system that allows fixed elements and also stretched elements"
6723360,6729200," and so on and so forth. Yeah. This requires like a little bit of thinking, uh, right, right, right, right."
6729200,6740880," So, but apart from that, uh, okay. So something went wrong. I don't know. Oh, unbalanced. Um, yeah, I forgot to remove this thing."
6740880,6758960," Uh, uh, okay. Uh, uh, uh, so. Hmm. All right. But the problem with the editor is that it doesn't scroll at all, right?"
6758960,6764240," So for instance, if you have a very long thing, right, so you cannot see what you're editing in there, right?"
6764240,6770240," And especially if you go to the right, uh, you actually went over the view and it would be nice if this entire thing scrolled somehow."
6770240,6776080," Right. So, but it doesn't scroll right now at all. So I'm going to create a separate to do for this, uh,"
6776080,6788320," entire thing. Uh, so edit fields, um, okay. UI edit field does not scroll according to the cursor, right?"
6788320,6792560," So it doesn't scroll according to the cursor and another similar thing in here, right?"
6792560,6799760," If you have a lot of elements in the, in the list, right? So, uh, let's actually generate shit ton of elements in here."
6800240,6806720," Super quick. Um, right. As you can see, you're generating shit ton of elements and they start rendering"
6806720,6812480," in a really weird fashion, uh, which doesn't make any sense. So this is something that also needs to be fixed."
6813040,6830080," Um, right. Um, right. Um, um, um, so let's put it like this, um, um, the item lists don't handle, uh,"
6832880,6845040," the amount of items bigger than this screen. Um, okay. The item lists don't have, uh, a scroll area of"
6845040,6849440," some sort, right? You know, you know what I mean? Some sort of a scroll area. This is going to be a"
6849440,6855760," separate to do in here. So we'll see how we can, we can solve all of that. Uh, Cyberdyne. Yeah. Thank you so"
6855760,6859440," much for four months of, uh, Twitch crime subscription. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
6859440,6869120," And welcome to our epic rust club. How about that? How about that? Yup. Uh, okay. So I really like that."
6873760,6884320," Um, yo, uh, implement, uh, UI, uh, edit field. There we go. And I'm going to push that right into the repo."
6884320,6894240," So let's actually, uh, add support for edits, uh, field to done list as well. Right. Uh, because I think"
6894240,6910080," that's quite important yet again, we're going to have a similar situation, right? So, uh, if you are,"
6910080,6916960," yeah, I need to copy paste this code now. Uh, so you are in highlight mode"
6919440,6929760," and if index is the current element, right? If it's a current element, uh, and you are"
6929760,6937600," in the editing mode, you need to implement the editing mode. Otherwise, uh, you're not in the editing mode."
6937600,6944240," You're just showing the currently selected thing. Uh, and we can simply copy paste. Where is my display line?"
6944240,6949840," Yeah, there we go. So it's going to be something like this. Uh huh. So, and this one is going to be"
6949840,6963920," just basically highlighted player. Um, all right. Um, and, uh, now in here, it's the same thing, but, uh,"
6963920,6973200," with a regular pair, right? Uh, regular pair. Uh huh. And if it's editing time,"
6974400,6980160," editing time, we need to call to the edit field. All right. We need to call it the edit field."
6980160,6984480," Uh, and also remove all of that stuff."
6984480,6996080," So editing cursor. Uh huh. So current key current, we're handling that and then we're disabling all of this."
6996720,7004080," All right. So that's pretty cool. Uh, but it also means that when we press I, yeah, so,"
7004080,7011040," so there's a lot of duplications between these two panels. Uh, and that's exactly what I want to see."
7011040,7015200," That's precisely what I want to see because that it reveals interesting patterns"
7016880,7025200," that we can compress later. Um, somehow we'll see how"
7025200,7036640," to do. Okay. This is actually pretty cool. Uh, this is done length. Uh huh. Uh, and"
7038800,7046720," yeah. So this one is more of a mutable now, right? This thing is mutable. Uh huh. Perfect. And I guess"
7046720,7057520," that's it. Okay. So if I try to now edit something in here, it works. So yep. Let's remove the debug output."
7058080,7069280," Uh, it's not needed anymore. Uh huh. Mmm. And if I run it like this, uh, yep. Just a second. I need to"
7069280,7076320," get rid of this thing. Uh, yep. You can edit that. I can edit that. Then I can exit and it's still going"
7076320,7082240," to be there. So as you can see, I can move, I can also move things around, uh, and stuff like that."
7082240,7087280," This is actually pretty cool. So then I can say that this one is done, but then I found the typo."
7087280,7093520," So this is going to be that. Uh huh. All right. So that looks good."
7093520,7099600," So yeah, I think we implemented it. Uh, we implemented, uh, actually the editing of the"
7099600,7108480," elements. You can control that now. Um, uh, so we have a lot of things that are not properly"
7108480,7116480," documented yet. Like for instance, uh, when you press G, uh, small G and big G,"
7116480,7121680," it actually jumps to the end or beginning of the list. I don't know why we don't have that documented."
7121680,7128080," Uh, so maybe I should actually recommend that, but in any case, uh, let's do a committee committee"
7128080,7140240," of what we have right now. Um, okay. Allow editing of the done, uh, panel, uh, editing items of the"
7140240,7147120," done panel and I'm going to push that right at the repo. Hello up curiosity. Nice nickname."
7153280,7165680," All right. Uh, so I think I need to document that. All right. So it's going to be, uh, KBD, uh,"
7169840,7188000," jump to the beginning, um, uh, to the start and the item of the current item list. So that's basically what we're having here."
7188000,7209440," Uh, KJ move cursor up and down shift K drag things around up and down, uh, delete the current element queue. Um, so interestingly,"
7209440,7218800," I suppose if we sort of like following the whim conventions, right. To edit something you want to do"
7218800,7226000," actually are, yeah, I think, yeah, I think it, it has to be R right. Because in Vim, right."
7226240,7236240," Uh, R means replacing a character, right. Because I want to actually, um, use I for inserting a new, uh,"
7236240,7244080," new item, right? Essentially when I press I, uh, I want to create a new item and go into the editing mode"
7244080,7257600," of that specific item. Uh, all right. So, uh, let me go super quick. Um, uh, so where is I? All right."
7257600,7264160," So this is going to be R and this is also going to be R. So if I do something like this, uh, I press R,"
7264160,7273680," this is going to be that. Uh, okay. That's cool. Um, so, and that means in red me, we're going to have"
7274080,7282720," something like this. Hmm. Could use O to add a new item below and O to add new item above. Uh,"
7282720,7292560," wait a second. Oh yeah. I know what you're talking about. Yeah. Okay. I actually use O quite often"
7292560,7297520," when I use Vim. It's just like, it's part of my reflexes. So I did, didn't realize that I use O."
7297520,7303120," Okay. So that's, that sounds like a pretty good idea then. In that case, maybe we can use I"
7304080,7307040," we can use I and I is going to be actually"
7307040,7314480," setting the index at the beginning"
7314480,7323680," and a will set the index at, uh, the cursor at the end. So that will be actually kind of interesting."
7325360,7335200," So, so I, yeah. So that means we'll have to do something like, uh, sends you to replace mode"
7335200,7344240," and R just replaces one character. I know that. Thank you very much. So, um, uh, what do we have here?"
7344240,7355280," so i need to do something like okay uh"
7370320,7380480," rename the current item"
7380480,7386480," all right so"
7386480,7392240," use r instead of i"
7395120,7407600," to edit the items i'm gonna push that right uh all right so what do we have here to do"
7407600,7415040," so there's a lot of like to do's that are not actual to do's know what i'm talking about"
7415040,7420320," it's kind of annoying maybe i should actually use fix me instead of to do for this project"
7421200,7428240," uh let's see how it goes uh all right fake to do's false positives"
7428240,7431680," um"
7431680,7440320," implement editing of the items"
7441680,7451280," of the least items and it's gonna be fun implement editing of the most items not only least items but"
7451280,7455920," the most items oh i'm so sorry anyway uh"
7459120,7466160," uh now uh let me try to do clipping uh and see what's going on in there okay we're good what about"
7466160,7470560," fmt fmt fixed some stuff"
7473600,7476720," fix uh cargo fmt"
7476720,7481200," remarks it's gonna push that"
7481200,7491760," i like this song"
7494960,7500960," it's pretty cool it's pretty cool it's pretty chill so let's actually snitch up those uh things uh"
7500960,7510480," so it's gonna be snitch report uh and body introduced in uh 25 all right"
7510480,7514320," um make a"
7516560,7524400," one day i'm gonna i'm gonna actually report this as a to do okay uh buy bread imagine like having"
7524400,7533360," that in the issue tracker uh um all right so i just feel there's no scroll yeah so this is something"
7533360,7540160," that needs to be done this is another fake to do another fake to do the items don't have a scroll area"
7541600,7550480," um all right so uh let me push that right into the repo and ironically your mom's issue tracker oh"
7550480,7552080," nice"
7552080,7555040," very funny"
7555040,7562960," okay"
7566880,7572480," so we had a huge switch case now it's smeared across the entire code"
7572480,7581360," using github as a crucial list that's a five head move that's a five head move for sure"
7581360,7587520," um all right so i'm just waiting for the continuous integration and after it's done"
7587520,7591760," i think i want to quickly implement adding a new element"
7594800,7601280," because it should be essentially you insert and you empty list into the item"
7601280,7607840," and instantly go into the edit mode and that's literally it that's how simple it's gonna be"
7607840,7615520," i really love it so yeah we'll see we'll see how it goes come on github you can do that i believe in you"
7615520,7617520," i believe in you github"
7617520,7620400," yo"
7622640,7628080," hmm"
7628080,7632640," clip is mine bitcoin that's why it takes so long"
7632640,7638320," uh true uh truly true"
7638320,7647600," okay so that's fine i can finally merge this into i think"
7650080,7652320," and delete the branch perfect"
7652320,7655360," uh let's fish this thing"
7655360,7668720," all right so uh let's see so the issue uh add new items to to do so the issue number is two all right"
7668720,7678240," um so what we're gonna use for for this thing we're gonna use i um rename the carnage"
7678240,7688320," uh insert insert insert a new item insert a new item insert new item all right so i'm gonna go to the src"
7688320,7689760," uh"
7689760,7700800," and let's find okay so here is oh my god it's actually formatted it so badly oh my god"
7703280,7709840," the hell is this the hell is this really okay so it actually moved this thing on the next line"
7709840,7712560," but in here it actually moved it here"
7715040,7727040," is that because it actually over flew like uh yeah 100"
7728640,7739920," okay cool um nice"
7739920,7751120," just just give me some time i need to catch my breath after a shock so it's just like i'm just gathering my"
7751120,7761760," thoughts um um what i wanted to do uh all right so we're currently in in the to do right so we are"
7761760,7769120," iterating we found the current item and if while being with the current item we're in editing mode we"
7769120,7775600," just redirect everything to the editing mode otherwise uh we're just displaying the element highlighted but"
7775600,7784640," if the r was pressed um we are switching to the editing mode and now we need to handle i uh essentially"
7784640,7787760," right so it could be something like if um"
7791600,7804560," if some i key current uh x x as you ate as character right so and essentially what i want to do i want to do"
7804560,7818640," to do this um vector uh rust uh std"
7818640,7822800," uh insert"
7825680,7830560," so insert the vector shifting elements after it after so"
7830560,7839200," because i want to insert this thing yeah let's actually insert it uh at the current uh at the"
7839200,7846000," current position so we're going to insert um a new string simply just inserting a new string"
7846000,7855040," then i'm setting editing cursor to zero and editing to true and just consuming the current key"
7856240,7864560," believe it or not that is entire implementation of inserting a new element you literally insert a"
7864560,7870560," new element into the vector and switching to the editing mode this is absolutely beautiful this"
7870560,7877360," approach just makes it so much easier to just pile things on top of the code right so uh let me see"
7877360,7885520," this is going to cargo run um and it doesn't compile i'm so happy about it okay so let's properly uh"
7885520,7889600," build this entire thing and i think now it should compile right"
7889600,7900880," i think that rust is hard i'll stick to go yeah to be fair go i like go better than just not gonna lie"
7900880,7906640," i recently programmed in go and it was actually quite pleasant um so"
7906640,7914480," uh this current the viewership dropped like half half of the people instantly left the stream like what the"
7914480,7925200," what the did you just say uh all right so to do the local variable with the similar to do current okay"
7925200,7927200," uh"
7927200,7932320," i cannot borrow to do as immutable more than once at a time"
7932320,7941040," i think that means we have to actually do that like outside oh yeah that makes sense actually believe it or not"
7941040,7946320," because we're because we're controlling the whole list not the specific element"
7946320,7966880," so the thing i learned about uh streaming and content on the internet in general you can't create a career"
7966880,7973440," as the creator of programming content it is not a thing programming content in the in on the internet"
7973440,7981440," is not a thing you can make a career as the rust content creator or go content creator or javascript"
7981440,7988960," content creator but never program nobody gives the about programming literally nobody people want to"
7988960,7996720," write a rat hole about specific languages about their favorite languages it's amazing um willington wa thank"
7996720,8000960," you so much for two months of twitch crime subscription thank you thank you thank you and welcome to our"
8000960,8008240," epic rust club yes we're a rust club we're making content on rust oh thank you so much the two-time champion"
8008240,8019840," yes yes yes yes all right so um what i want to do i want to do to do uh to do uh insert uh to do current um"
8023680,8041280," so string new let go um and after that i do editing cursor zero then we go into the editing uh true and i guess that's it"
8044480,8057280," now i'm about with this finger this finger press i are you ready"
8057280,8074240," okay what can i say your mom is on to-do list your mom was on to the list today anyway uh i can"
8074720,8077680," drag it around and then i can say that your mom is done"
8077680,8078480," oh"
8078480,8084640," not done yet anyway so"
8084640,8098080," okay so as you can see it's as easy as that uh yeah right so you can just insert a new thing"
8098080,8101920," and there we go here's this stuff and then it goes in here and then you can do it"
8102800,8103600," um"
8103600,8115920," okay uh why i can't oh yeah you can't do yeah you can't delete this thing because it needs to be moved"
8115920,8121600," into done and only then you can you can remove it uh all right so maybe we should print something"
8121600,8131040," uh when you add a new element uh when you add a new element so we can do something like this notification"
8131040,8134080," and then uh push str uh"
8134080,8142640," more things to do right i don't know is that a good notification i don't know"
8142640,8152960," uh right essentially yeah more things oh it's i have an idea uh what what needs to be done"
8152960,8160960," right then it's going to be question right so uh that's actually pretty cool right you want to insert"
8160960,8169760," anything what needs to be done right and then you start typing uh buy milk right so uh this one is done"
8169760,8176800," and i want to remove this thing uh and the milk has been bought and yeah pretty pretty cool so"
8176800,8187360," so in the entire implementation of adding new element is just this literally yeah it's just that simple"
8187920,8193920," uh i absolutely love it um you can't insert elements into the done list though right so first you have"
8193920,8199520," to insert an element in to do finish it and then from done you can delete it right and vice versa you"
8199520,8207920," cannot delete elements from to do uh right um okay i have an idea actually uh when you try to delete an"
8207920,8221920," element uh while being in to do we can print something like um notification push str uh can't uh remove"
8221920,8235360," items from uh from to do mark it as done first is that a good maybe it's too long but i'm not sure well we'll see"
8236080,8245040," right you try to delete it can't remove items from to do mark it as done first okay so and then uh yeah"
8245040,8248560," okay nice"
8248560,8259440," insert a new element uh all right so i'm gonna actually commit this kind of stuff separately"
8259440,8262800," uh and let's do a committee committee it's gonna be two"
8264240,8270000," implement inserting a new item all right then"
8270000,8276880," warn about deleting from to-do list"
8276880,8280960," uh can you mark yeah yeah you can look"
8280960,8287280," yeah you can you can move them around"
8290400,8296800," but you cannot cannot insert oh i think because of that it would make sense to actually warn about the"
8296800,8304560," done list as well right so in a done list if you try to insert something uh right we're gonna say"
8304560,8317840," something like um notification push str deep singularity hi uh can't insert"
8319200,8332240," new done items uh insert them in uh only to do is allowed something like that i don't know so it's"
8332240,8338320," just like it's a test it's not supposed to be convenient right so can insert new done items only to"
8338320,8344000," do is allowed okay so you can insert this thing and then you can't remove from these things you have to"
8344000,8351760," first mark it as done and only then you can move it into a piece uh so um okay so if i move everything here"
8359760,8369440," that uh we have a raid from marco brown marco bruno def with one headed in 52 browser tabs thank"
8369440,8374720," you so much for opening so many browser tabs and reading me i really really appreciate it i hope"
8374720,8381360," your computer is fine uh after so many browser tabs so uh what we're doing today we're developing"
8381360,8388800," the to do app in rust you can find the source code uh in the in the description all right oh"
8388800,8393920," you guys from brazil hello hello brazilian friends hello from russia"
8393920,8409440," how much ram do you need for that a lot"
8409440,8417840," okay so the to do app uh looks like this right so it's written in"
8417840,8424960," rust and it uses and curses and you can switch between two tabs you have two tabs done to do"
8424960,8430880," and done and if you're done with a particular item you can just mark it as done if you realize that"
8430880,8438160," you're not done with it yet you can mark it back um and you can edit the the current items right for"
8438160,8446080," for instance you have two uh make cup of tea one of them must be make a coffee right and you can drag the"
8446080,8452800," items around you can reorder them however you want right uh and then if you're done right you can delete"
8452800,8457280," the items from done into a piece sort of like completely remote because this is sort of like"
8457280,8464320," intermediate archive and if you need to do a new thing uh write something like rewrite in go you can"
8464320,8472560," edit so uh that's pretty convenient um and all of that excluding third party dependencies is actually"
8472560,8479760," almost six 600 lines of code and we're not using any frameworks except in curses and in in curses we"
8479760,8487120," only use capabilities of move the cursor to x y and place those characters in there so all of the user"
8487120,8493040," interaction all of this kind of stuff is actually hand coded right we didn't use any special frameworks"
8493040,8499040," or anything like that all of that is literally hand coded including editing and moving around the cursor"
8499040,8504880," and stuff all of that is head coded 600 lines of code it's actually it's designed to be as small as"
8504880,8511680," possible actually it's designed to be as simple as possible we're not trying to do more than actually"
8511680,8522720," needed uh to perform this entire thing uh so i don't know that's what we're doing uh all right so uh and we"
8523520,8533760," we're almost done i need to make a pull request um add a warning about adding items to"
8533760,8541200," done list uh how big is the binary right now i don't know i didn't count uh but for this kind"
8541200,8548640," of applications i don't think it matters that much um all right so and let me push that right into the"
8548640,8556160," repo uh okay so let's make a pull request um let's make a pull a request"
8556160,8561600," okay"
8561600,8572240," maybe there should be also some sort of like a help mode uh that shows all of the current uh"
8573120,8576960," key bindings and whatnot with immediate ui it's actually super easy to implement"
8576960,8585760," um yeah it is in fact super easy to implement uh you introduce another boolean and at the top of the"
8585760,8592560," iteration if the help mode is enabled you render completely different thing right so we can even"
8592560,8599520," move the main application into a separate function uh and then the help uh renderer is going to be"
8599520,8606400," another function as well so yeah so there's a lot of uh you know room for refactoring in here"
8607120,8612960," uh all right so i'm gonna close this entire thing uh i didn't think i introduced any new to do's hopefully"
8612960,8618720," so when we have fake to do's yeah when we have fake to this all right so maybe i should also do a clippy"
8618720,8628240," test uh all right so something like clipping um all right and also fmt all right so in fmt uh"
8628800,8638560," uh huh it's going to fix uh cargo fmt remarks there we go let's push that right at the repo all right"
8638560,8642400," what else do we have in here okay so it complains a little bit because of the formatting of course"
8642400,8653200," uh so keep track of the date undo system would be rather interesting um so and as i already mentioned i"
8653200,8662160," think we need to have something like help page help page with um key binding uh descriptions"
8662160,8665440," so i'm gonna send to myself and there we go"
8665440,8676880," all right so um that's pretty cool um but unfortunately boys and girls it is time for me to go"
8678080,8683520," thanks everyone who's watching me right now i really appreciate it have a good one and see you"
8683520,8690240," next time i don't know when i don't know where but uh it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't"
8690240,8695600," check out the project that we're working on check out the description if you're watching this on youtube"
8695600,8702720," and uh let's maybe rate somebody we were rated by so many browser tabs so maybe we should also rate"
8702720,8713200," somebody back to back to back how about that uh so who should we rate who should we rate is anyone doing"
8713200,8722000," anything epic on the science and technology section of twitch let me see thank you for the stream thank"
8722000,8730880," you for watching i really appreciate it so is anyone doing epic rust development"
8730880,8735360," so"
8735360,8743360," c plus plus 20 game development with open gl sounds interesting"
8745360,8745920," um"
8745920,8745920," um"
8745920,8758880," okay they even have a mic and explaining stuff so that's that's an insta raid uh c plus plus 69 one"
8758880,8761440," i'm so funny my guess"
8768320,8769520," uh red"
8769520,8788240," uh all right with the red boys and girls and i see you all next time love you all you"
