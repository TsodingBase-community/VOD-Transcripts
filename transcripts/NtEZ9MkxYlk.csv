1409600,1416560," I think you probably know this, I think you probably know this, I think you probably know this, but you don't have to fulfill all this stuff in the requirement, it depends on who else applies."
1416560,1446540," Well, yeah, it's true, it's true."

1566460,1573460," I'm talking how to be competitive in a career and how to land a job in Google, I won't answer that to you, I don't answer this kind of question."

1591460,1601920," um how can i achieve a good level in computer science it's the same question i'm sorry you're"
1601920,1609780," trying to like you know try to bypass my logic or something i don't know uh fk4 os uh thank you so"
1609780,1614600," much for two months of uh of twitch prime subscription thank you thank you thank you and"
1614600,1620900," welcome to our epic computer science club how about that welcome all right so we need to implement"
1620900,1630460," this shit by the way um uh so and"
1630460,1636500," how are you today thanks for the stream well i'm doing well thank you thank you for watching"
1636500,1645680," hello the rendels hello hello so let me see let me see we need to implement all of this shit"
1645680,1654400," homage you did you've got issues yeah that's true like i got at least eight of them"
1654400,1660200," so yes uh three of them are blocked though so"
1660200,1668040," yeah it is in fact true um"
1668040,1681600," so where do we do this kind of stuff where do we do the cmd thingy uh actually i think it's called uh"
1681600,1688160," uh pipe i think it's called pipe"
1688160,1701820," so the entire thing is actually quite kind of complicated so um probably because i was just"
1701820,1710060," smashing things together uh can you tell me if i have to make such compile time programming can i do"
1710060,1714380," specifically for mac only compile time programming i didn't know what i mean by compile time programming"
1714380,1720380," uh c doesn't really have that much compile time programming to be fair apart from c preprocessor"
1720380,1726540," like can i do in swift and uh or i have to stick with c or c plus plus"
1727420,1735420," uh what a mess of a language what a mess of a question okay uh if you have to make such compile"
1735420,1742300," type programming can i do specifically for mac only i don't understand what you want"
1742300,1747900," uh what do you want you want to execute things at compile time in different languages"
1747900,1750940," uh you have different mechanism and you don't have to"
1752300,1758060," like i don't understand what you're trying to ask me uh i'm trying to comprehend your question but"
1758060,1762300," apparently i cannot because i have issues um so i'm sorry"
1762300,1771180," that's a cool thing okay so every time i don't want to ask uh like understand or answer a question"
1771180,1772940," i'm gonna say that i have issues"
1772940,1778300," this is perfect thank you random"
1778940,1783420," viewer of the internet for giving me such a beautiful excuse i'm just gonna say i have"
1783420,1786700," issues i'm sorry like i i cannot ask for your questions i've got issues"
1786700,1802780," maybe i actually have issues because sometimes people ask like very insane and i literally like i've"
1802780,1808780," genuinely tried to understand and i cannot understand like and i'm thinking is that is that a problem with me"
1808780,1814460," maybe it is in fact problem with me like it's just like maybe my brain is fucked maybe maybe it's true"
1814460,1816620," maybe i've got issues who knows"
1816620,1824060," it's okay to have issues it's more important to have pull requests to fix them"
1824060,1831260," okay that's true that's actually true um okay so i think i wanna uh"
1832940,1841500," i think i want to uh have some like a little bit more strict typing"
1841500,1848780," you just totally bad at answering uh to be fair"
1848780,1859100," from my perspective people are totally bad at asking questions like i rarely get uh good uh questions"
1859740,1865020," that they can actually answer so basically my answer usually the quality of my answer usually depends on"
1865020,1870700," the quality of the question so if you see me answering in a really bad way so that means the"
1870700,1873180," question is bad so yeah"
1881100,1886540," sorry um the quality of my answer depends on the quality of the question or the amount of money you"
1886540,1892540," pay me could be also true but people don't pay me uh for for the for answering the questions for some"
1892540,1901340," reason i don't know why so i set up donation button specifically like pay me and i legit will try to"
1901340,1906060," answer your question right so in the quality of the question the answer is going to depend on the amount of"
1906060,1912460," money you actually put it uh but if you wanted the answer for free you just have to ask like ask a good"
1912460,1918860," question and nobody's doing that like people people do donate me though people do donate me to say"
1918860,1927580," something stupid on the stream or they do donate me to uh to i don't know just to buy something but"
1927580,1934380," nobody like quite rarely people donate me to to ask a question and i wonder why is this like"
1934380,1941020," because it would be the perfect situation by the way because uh i would legit try to answer the"
1941020,1945980," question right because a person paid money right and if i don't try to answer the question i will"
1945980,1952620," feel like i scammed somebody right so basically with money you force me to um to to answer your question"
1952620,1958860," and second of all i if i answer your question well i feel like i earned that money and just nobody wants"
1958860,1964940," to get into that relationship with me like i just don't understand it's pretty strange"
1964940,1973100," people are nervous to pay ten dollars and be embarrassed in front of but they do that for free"
1973100,1981820," every time so uh but what's interesting is that if you pay ten dollars i would be forced to actually"
1981820,1987180," properly uh answer a question and you see like here here's the here's the thing can you tell them if i"
1987180,1996620," have to make such compile type programming can i do specifically for mac only like can i die in swift or"
1996620,2007660," okay you okay you do realize that after that donation people won't won't want to donate even more after"
2007660,2014380," that right so because now they will think that donations are used to making fun of them right so"
2014380,2023580," yeah thank you for for the donation g but this is not your question i'm talking about like a"
2024380,2027260," genuine experience right i'm talking about genuine"
2027260,2037660," now i feel bad now i feel bad okay thank you so much i'm gonna definitely refund that donation"
2037660,2039820," thing thank you all right whatever"
2045100,2055580," so uh what we're gonna do um so i want to introduce like um a thing for the commands right so it's"
2055580,2061580," going to be type a command and uh it's going to be you know a bunch of arguments"
2068540,2072380," so and essentially i want a pipe to be"
2072380,2080780," something like input file path right something like input file path and the output file path"
2080780,2091020," so and what's interesting is that null means that uh the the beginning of the pipe should use standard"
2091020,2106300," output right so and then we have uh a chain right we have a chain uh which is essentially this thing so it's"
2106300,2111500," going to be chain um and uh size t chain size"
2113980,2119420," all right so we have this kind of things we have this kind of types how you construct those types"
2119420,2132300," uh doesn't really matter all right how we construct them doesn't really matter"
2140700,2142620," what do pipes do um"
2142620,2153820," they represent a unidirectional data channel that can be used for inter-process communication"
2153820,2160380," does it make sense i'm talking about pipes that are created by the pipe syscall"
2160380,2168620," um hello square tool please speak english nobody understands you it's an english speaking channel"
2170700,2176300," all right so and i want to have a function that spawns uh the pipe"
2176300,2188220," so and do i want to have anything else so what's interesting is that i think i'm going to"
2188220,2196140," yeah i'm gonna just keep it like that but on top of that i want to have like a separate thing uh that"
2196140,2207260," spawns a cmd as well right and when you spawn the cmd um you also can provide uh file descriptor for the"
2207260,2213980," input and file descriptor for the output uh what's interesting is that we'll probably have to have some"
2213980,2221020," some sort of a type dev we can call it fd or something"
2221020,2230540," maybe yeah so it should be called something uh no"
2232220,2245260," um no build fd file descriptor sure so basically on uh windows win32 right on windows it's going to be"
2245260,2247340," something like handle"
2247340,2255020," all right i think i think it's it's what it is what's up lost algorithm welcome to the stream"
2257900,2270940," um"
2270940,2282300," so this is basically what i want to do but i cannot come up with a good name for this thing so i'm not"
2282300,2283020," going to do it right now"
2283020,2293740," so and essentially uh the spawn pipe it has a bunch of uh these cmds and this function is going to use"
2293740,2296060," this function to spawn everything accordingly"
2296060,2303340," all right so and i want to first implement this thing somehow"
2303340,2307420," i want to first implement this thing oh by the way so i think"
2308780,2315020," this thing should be taken by a pointer right so and it's kind of similar with"
2315020,2323980," nulls in here so if fdin is null uh right uh that means you have to use standard input and uh"
2323980,2328700," in this case you have to use standard out so i want to have like a proper"
2328700,2335020," functions that make it easier to like implement a particular algorithms for like piping and whatnot"
2335020,2340940," so once you have the cmds uh you can specify their ends quite easily and you can just chain this"
2340940,2345580," thing together you can chain different cmds together right so that's going to be the idea here"
2345580,2353980," all right so and also i think this function should return uh"
2355980,2365420," t right so basically you spawn the process and then uh you can wait uh until uh the process has finished"
2365420,2369420," so uh it's going to be cpd"
2377900,2386940," uh and we're going to fork this process if cpd is less than uh zero cpd stands for child pd right"
2386940,2393580," and if it's less than zero we're going to say panic uh saying could not uh fork a child"
2393580,2398060," it's going to be a stir error error error no"
2400140,2407980," um okay once we fork the child we can check whether the cpd is zero that means we are in the child"
2407980,2413340," process and if it's not equal zero that means we are in the parent process"
2413340,2421420," and in the parent process we want to just return the cpd to whoever called this function so they can"
2421420,2428780," wait on the child all right so and once we are in the child we need to check whether the file descriptor is"
2428780,2429260," provided"
2429260,2441100," so and uh here we're going to do what we need to do jupe right we need to do jupe 2. so by the way"
2441100,2448700," yesterday we explored yesterday we explored how to do the piping on osix systems and we wrote a simple"
2448700,2456700," example that just actually pipes two commands together and i put that example um put that example on gist so"
2456700,2462380," for anyone who's interested right so uh oh i couldn't copy paste it"
2462380,2473340," so yeah so what this thing does it basically uh redirects its own source code into the cat"
2473900,2480700," and then it takes the output of the cat and redirects it into the sort and then it redirects the output of"
2480700,2489180," the third into output txt and all of that is done purely within c using only linux or rather posix"
2489180,2496380," sys calls or without using external shells or anything like that so this is like an example how shells do that"
2496380,2505340," right it's rather the way the shells do that it's a little bit um involved uh and right so but that's how we do that without the shells"
2508700,2523180," just just just a second i need to check something i'm gonna i'm gonna be back within like a couple of seconds"
2523180,2535980," so"
2535980,2548780," all right"
2548780,2560620," all right so as we know if fd is no that means you have to use standard input but if it's not we need to do a"
2560620,2569500," doop so it's gonna be dupe uh std in file number right and this entire thing can also fail so we"
2569500,2575420," probably have to check that it's not failed situation and then we're gonna do panic could not"
2576380,2589340," set up uh std in for for child process and then we're gonna do str error it's gonna be error no okay"
2589340,2600060," so the same thing uh okay so the setting up the standard input is done so let's actually set up standard output"
2603020,2612940," dupe two is gonna be fd out std out file number it's less than zero then we're gonna panic um couldn't"
2612940,2620780," not set up std out for child process right as to the error error no"
2626140,2634060," okay so once the standard output in input are set up uh we're gonna do exec lp uh and"
2634060,2638780," we're gonna use the arguments within the command structure so within the command structure we have"
2638780,2640620," the arguments that we can just use here"
2640620,2655820," so cmd args zero cmd args like this and this entire thing can fail so this entire function may return because"
2655820,2664140," it returns when it fails and if it fails uh we're gonna say could not exec child uh not file child"
2664140,2675820," process uh right there's gonna be str error error no uh and yeah and that's it actually right so if the"
2675820,2684700," child um execs successfully this exec will never return so this thing will also never happen so it will only"
2684700,2691740," happen in the parent right so so far so good so this is how you can implement such thing which basically"
2691740,2694940," sets up standard input and standard output of the cmd"
2694940,2702140," what up what's up cozy white bear welcome to the stream welcome welcome welcome welcome"
2702140,2709900," so and essentially uh this is a function that we can use to then implement something like spawn a pipe where you"
2709900,2718780," have several cmds right so essentially you can spawn several cmds uh and then using these arguments a file"
2718780,2725260," input and file output you can connect them together and you can build as long of a pipes as you want"
2725260,2731100," so at least this is in theory i haven't implemented that uh ever yet uh maybe it's not going to work out"
2731100,2738860," easily but we'll see we'll see if it will work out um so another interesting thing is that how do you wait"
2738860,2745260," on the pipe right so you when you wait on the pipe you should wait on each an individual um"
2746060,2754860," speed of that pipe so the amount of peds that will be created uh by this function is chain size so for"
2754860,2761420," each individual cmd in the chain it will create a pit um so what i'm thinking is that maybe this function"
2761420,2768220," will also return you array of pizza so you will have to allocate that array yourself and you know how much"
2768220,2772460," you need to allocate because it has to be equal to chain size we might as well actually document that somehow"
2773020,2788700," right saying that um the size of the cpids array must be uh pipe must be equal uh to pipe chain size"
2788700,2799260," right so essentially we're gonna use that value as the size of that array right and once you um spawn a pipe"
2799260,2807900," uh you get a bunch of peds that you can wait on uh and do some stuff with them whatever you want uh so"
2807900,2814860," we already have a function like wait for pd but it waits for a single pd so maybe we can create a"
2814860,2821260," version of a function that waits for an array of kids uh so for for too easily for you to wait on them"
2824940,2834780," all right so uh okay why not allocate yourself then we can allocate it ourselves sure why not"
2834780,2843580," since we're just letting everything leak we might as well uh actually make it easier yeah i think it's"
2843580,2848620," gonna be even easier so let's actually return like array of bits um"
2848620,2859900," so and yeah that's how it's gonna be um"
2859900,2867580," might be stupid question but can you pipe std error with that as well yes you can"
2869420,2874700," uh technically uh technically or do you mean with the current implementation with the kind of"
2874700,2883100," implementation i don't think so uh but we might as well actually do something like const char"
2883100,2893820," uh error file path so no means std error yeah so we can include that as well"
2899020,2902780," uh what is your reason to use c over c plus plus"
2902780,2906700," oh boy it's a"
2906700,2916860," it's it's it's it's not a single reason it's actually um system of reasons i would say"
2924140,2929260," do you have daily"
2929260,2932220," oh i have issues"
2932220,2937020," i don't have daily i have issues"
2937020,2941020," um"
2941020,2951020," um"
2951020,2964140," oh"
2977820,2982620," oh shave well you see i was right actually i i do have issues apparently"
2982620,2989340," so yeah do you shave daily no i don't really shave daily i shave uh once per two days i think"
2989340,2991660," by daily yes"
2991660,2999740," uh yeah i do have issues yes apparently that person was right i do have issues"
3001100,3019260," all right and the way uh we're gonna redirect the error right now it's it's not gonna"
3019260,3026220," we're not gonna use that um but yeah the way you're gonna you're gonna do that is fd error"
3027580,3028140," and it's just"
3028140,3040540," what is going on in the chat today um"
3049340,3050540," uh std error"
3050540,3062220," okay so this is how you redirect the error right because uh lost algorithm essentially uh std error"
3062220,3068780," is just yet another file descriptor like std out or std in so if you want to redirect that you just"
3068780,3073420," do the same thing to do the same thing to do the same thing as with std in or std out so yeah there's"
3073420,3077100," nothing special about std error from that perspective though"
3077100,3078940," um"
3078940,3083100," so but thank you for reminding me about it could not set up"
3083100,3087180," std error for child process"
3089980,3094780," uh"
3094780,3095420," uh"
3095420,3095740," okay"
3095740,3103340," that's cool uh so now we have that and in the pipe we have that uh"
3103340,3107500," but what's interesting is that do we wanna"
3107500,3115660," how do we wanna actually do this entire thing so it's gonna be std error"
3115660,3134300," so if we're gonna include like error"
3134300,3143500," um into the mix so maybe the syntax of the pipe stuff is gonna be slightly different right so we can"
3143500,3155420," have input uh input txt uh then you can have a chain uh for the cat and whatnot uh so after that"
3155420,3164300," maybe you can redirect the error into something like cat uh error txt right and then you can have a chain"
3164300,3170620," to like sort minus n and it could be something like error"
3171980,3178300," uh yeah so i think i think we're not gonna actually care about error redirection right now because it"
3178300,3184060," could be a little bit complex and that may require changing um"
3184060,3192860," changing the plan for now so i think i'm gonna just remove it for now"
3193740,3203820," so i'm gonna put it to do pipes do not allow redirecting uh std error yeah so this is something"
3203820,3205260," that we'll need here for sure"
3205260,3219660," the piping just is interesting never done that in c thank you you're welcome so we actually implemented"
3219660,3223980," that just yesterday so we came up with this thing alive"
3223980,3230860," okay"
3230860,3239580," so here's the pipe thingy so i'm gonna keep the fd fd error i'm gonna keep the fd error"
3240220,3243740," and uh just start implementing spawn pipe"
3243740,3257100," so uh let's do this thing if pipe chain size"
3257100,3265420," is equal to zero right so essentially we're gonna just return null then right you're not trying to"
3266060,3274380," uh to spawn anything uh to spawn anything uh then we want to allocate cpd's array cpd's"
3274380,3279500," is going to be a malloc right a malloc size of pt"
3283740,3288220," uh pipe chain size"
3288220,3293500," so here's an array"
3293500,3301180," here is an array and the thing is it's kind of difficult to"
3301180,3310460," come up with an algorithm that will utilize uh cmd call that will utilize the cmd call"
3311100,3317340," to chain together to chain together several cmd's so um i think i need to draw a little bit first to"
3317340,3319500," understand how this kind of stuff is done"
3319500,3329740," um"
3334060,3335420," um"
3335420,3345180," all right so um essentially right you have a bunch of processes like child processes"
3345180,3355580," and right you have n child processes but you have n minus one pipes between them"
3357580,3367900," right right um so n chill the rn but n minus one pipes"
3367900,3373820," right so and because of that it's kind of difficult to"
3373820,3384700," do all of that right so for example if we do n minus one iterations right if we do n minus one iterations"
3384700,3392300," we can always have an in the single iteration of a loop we can always create a child and the pipe"
3392300,3400060," right so we do n minus one right and we always create a child and a pipe and then after the uh"
3400060,3406780," loop is over uh we're gonna have a special case for this thing right special case for the last child"
3407500,3411740," um so it could be it could be something like this i think"
3411740,3423580," so oh it could be something slightly different right it could be the other way around for example"
3423580,3430220," instead of first iteration you just create this child well i mean you need to create the child with"
3430220,3434540," pipe already there so i think the approach where you just do it like that"
3435180,3441260," where you iterate it like that is gonna be better anyway so yeah let's just go that route i think"
3441260,3442940," it's a good route what do you guys think"
3442940,3447740," um"
3447740,3449740," so"
3465180,3477020," all right all right i'm gonna make a cup of tea oh i still have a team i was about to make a cup of tea"
3480860,3483420," chat chat is weird today yeah i don't know what is going on um"
3483420,3493260," maybe somebody posted a link to the stream somewhere right something like here's the guy that is easily"
3493260,3498220," irritated by stupid questions and that's why uh we have such a weird chat here"
3500860,3506940," so yeah anyways so let's try this idea um so we're gonna have n minus one iterations"
3506940,3513580," child size minus one plus plus i"
3513580,3521100," maybe twitch accidentally put your accommodations and maybe i don't know i don't know what's going on"
3522940,3524380," so yeah"
3524380,3535020," i'm new a browser and cyclone just saw a vote of your haskell stream i don't really do husky streams that"
3535020,3541020," often anymore so oh yeah i do them every week now was it a good stream because"
3541020,3547900," i don't know my husky streams kind of suck so i'm really sorry i'm really sorry about that"
3549500,3554300," so uh what i need to do here so i need to spawn a child"
3554300,3558460," right so we can probably do it like that it's going to be cpids"
3558460,3564380," i like this yeah so this is what we need to create here"
3564380,3571820," uh and it's kind of easy to create this thing here uh because we do have a cmd"
3578700,3580140," pipe chain"
3580140,3591820," okay"
3591820,3603820," so and here's the thing so we need to add as an input"
3607820,3615100," previous read file descriptor so of course uh the error is going to be null right so the error is"
3615100,3619820," going to be no we're not going to actually spawn anything there uh but what's going to be the input"
3619820,3624780," the input is going to be the one from the previous thing okay so this is how it's going to be um"
3626140,3635660," previous read fd so and it's going to be zero and yeah we're going to do it like that what's interesting"
3635660,3643660," is that if you are this in uh the first child you probably don't have a previous uh red fd so this is"
3643660,3651340," one of the things we want to do uh so it's going to be equal zero that means it's going to be null"
3651340,3655260," otherwise it's going to be pointed to the previous read fd okay cool"
3655260,3663500," uh no means yes it will be a standard one so depending on whether it's a standard input"
3663500,3668540," if you put a null to the standard but it's going to use standard input standard output standard error"
3668540,3671260," whatever so yeah something like this"
3674220,3684860," uh all right so it's going to be like that um and the output has to be to the right end of the pipe"
3684860,3691580," all right so we have to do the following thing uh pipe fd so we have to have these two things here"
3691580,3701820," pipe pipe fd right and this thing this entire thing can fail actually this entire thing can fail"
3703820,3715100," um so panic could not create pipe for a child process it's gonna be like this str error error"
3715100,3718780," error no okay so we have that"
3718780,3726300," it was better than my haskell i've tried writing three or four programs over the past five years"
3726300,3733020," and never seem to feel like i have any idea what i'm doing with it i see okay so"
3733420,3737180," what we have to use here we have to use the um"
3737180,3745340," pipe fd one as far as you know according to the pipe syscall uh to the pipe syscall"
3745340,3752060," this refers to the right end of this thing so that means this is what we're going to do here"
3752060,3760540," what's interesting is that now we need to set up the previous uh read so previous read fd um oh yeah this"
3760540,3768300," one is going to be interesting because we will have to close uh both of these descriptors we'll have to"
3768300,3777660," close both of these descriptors so if i uh not equal is greater than zero that means we'll have to close"
3778300,3789020," uh previous uh previous read fd and then we have to close pipe fd one but pipe fd zero will become the"
3789020,3796380," previous red fd for the next iteration for the next child so this is how we pipe everything together"
3799980,3806940," hello hello hello hello hello i'm doing all right uh thank you thank you for asking um okay"
3806940,3814460," so that can close fail can close fail i think close can fail but do we really care if it fails or not"
3814460,3820700," so um it usually fails when the descriptor is not correct so i don't think it makes much sense to"
3820700,3827020," actually test it here right it may fail if the pipe has failed and didn't provide like a proper description"
3827020,3828940," or whatnot um"
3835900,3842940," so so and we do here like n minus one iterations so we put this entire thing here"
3842940,3849900," uh"
3849900,3853660," that's pretty cool"
3857820,3866380," and on the last on the last child for the last child what we'll have to do we'll have to do uh cp'd um"
3866380,3869340," like this"
3869340,3872540," uh and"
3872540,3875020," essentially"
3882220,3887100," well yeah we'll have to do something like this size t last"
3887100,3893340," um might as well actually put a constant here"
3893340,3894860," um"
3894860,3905420," last this is a last do we always want to create the no i don't think so so"
3907900,3915420," this is output so the output has to be null in here but the input has to be okay"
3915420,3921100," if last"
3921100,3923100," equal zero"
3923100,3925740," that means we'll have to use"
3925740,3929260," null otherwise pre uh"
3929260,3930780," previous one"
3930780,3936140," okay so essentially this is how we can connect all of these things together"
3937340,3938220," essentially"
3938220,3940540," uh excluding the"
3940540,3943020," input and output file paths"
3943020,3951500," right so we have uh n minus one iterations and we have the last here iteration so and then we"
3951500,3954220," can just return uh this entire stuff here"
3954220,3956220," uh"
3956220,3956780," cpd"
3966780,3970380," you entered the clause was really it's it can happen in clothes"
3970380,3974380," huh"
3974380,3976540," oh"
3976540,3976860," shit"
3976860,3979900," huh"
3979900,3985500," interesting so it's better to actually check for this kind of situations"
3985500,3989500," maybe oh and also thank you for reminding me i have to close this thing"
3989500,3990380," uh"
3990380,3991180," uh"
3991180,3991500," uh"
3991500,3992060," previous"
3992060,3995980," unless if the last is greater than zero"
3995980,3997260," yeah"
3997260,4005660," so yeah i i guess we implemented the chaining thing"
4007820,4008860," um"
4008860,4009580," um"
4009580,4011660," linux is dangerous thing to work with"
4011660,4012380," yeah probably"
4012380,4019500," um"
4019500,4025500," writing uh"
4025500,4029900," while writing bsd in linux compatible code i was mystified by the linux sys calls"
4030700,4031420," yeah classic"
4031420,4036300," all right"
4036300,4042300," i'm gonna make a cup of tea chat"
4042300,4054540," so uh i want to check if all of that compiles because i was just typing this out without checking"
4054540,4057980," with that compiles or not and i'm not sure if it even makes any sense"
4057980,4060460," so let's do gcc"
4060460,4063820," oh no build no build dot c"
4063820,4073740," uh also epipe can happen when you write to pipe uh when reading site crashes uh that but that's a problem of the"
4073740,4077420," child processes right because i'm not reading writing to the pipes"
4077900,4083180," i just set them up and then i call the child process so it's up for the child process to"
4083180,4084700," you know figure that out i don't care"
4084700,4085980," um"
4085980,4087260," all right"
4087260,4092700," okay this thing doesn't compile because i forgot to put to remove this thing"
4092700,4095660," um"
4095660,4099260," panic implicit wait don't i have panic"
4099260,4104700," oh no i do have panic but it's just defined in the"
4104700,4106780," i see it's just defined in a weird place"
4107900,4112300," okay okay i'm gonna fix all that after i made a cup of tea"
4112300,4113500," um"
4113500,4124220," spawn a pipe"
4124220,4130220," um"
4134220,4137820," if you don't trust it i guess you have to avoid point or arithmetic"
4137820,4153820," i'm out of the context of the discussion"
4153820,4155820," um"
4155820,4173580," then some c on linux what would be equivalent to gnu c library on windows just windows api"
4174060,4175180," um so"
4175180,4180380," first of all part of the gnu c library"
4180380,4188700," um is actually standardized by the c standard so part of the gnu c library uh will be available on"
4188700,4193980," windows for you already right uh the one that is described by the standard things like"
4193980,4201660," uh i don't know like f open f close uh you know printf all that like part of the gnu c library it's"
4201660,4206060," already available for linux and if you write your program using only these things your program will"
4206060,4209660," literally work everywhere pretty much where you have a c compiler"
4209660,4210620," um"
4210620,4218460," uh apart from that something that is not standardized um yeah it's probably going to be win api"
4218460,4224620," but what's interesting is that you're pretty close to what's going on in reality"
4225340,4232780," right uh because in windows right you don't write programs that work directly with windows sys calls"
4232780,4238620," because windows sys calls are constantly change right so they're sort of private um my i suppose"
4238620,4243660," microsoft i don't know for sure but i think microsoft reserves by uh for themselves a right to"
4243660,4250140," change their sys calls at any time uh but what they don't change they don't change the layer above"
4250140,4256060," the sys calls win api library so if your program depends on win api uh so if even if they change"
4256060,4261980," the sys calls your program will still work so you're supposed to only use the um the win api library"
4261980,4272780," what's interesting is that technically the same uh role on linux is played by lipc library right because"
4272780,4281500," even though lipc exposes functions that it calls uh sys calls they're not very thin"
4281500,4288380," wrappers around sys calls sometimes they're thicker for example for situations when um between"
4288380,4294940," the linux versions the semantic of the sys call has changed but you still need to maintain the program"
4294940,4301740," that rely on that sys call working so sometimes what they do is that they essentially wrap the sys"
4301740,4307180," calls in a thicker way uh providing a condition so they check what's the kernel what's the version"
4307180,4312220," of the kernel if the version of the kernel is that they're going to call sys call one way and if the"
4312220,4318940," version of the kernel is in other ways is not they're going to call sys call in another way so yeah on on"
4318940,4326940," linux lipc is basically backward compatible layer on top of the sys calls but on windows win api library is"
4326940,4332860," the backward compatible thing so there is parallels between these things like on both of the operating"
4332860,4340780," systems if that's what you meant right but the part of the lipc is standardized right so that means"
4340780,4349100," part of the lipc will be available for you on windows as well so it's it's kind of like a very um nuanced"
4349100,4357260," situation right so it is like true but there's some nuances and stuff like that uh plus uh part of the"
4357260,4365180," posix is also implemented on windows a small part though but still implemented and another part of the"
4365180,4371660," posix is implemented on windows in an incompatible with posix way right for example"
4372460,4380300," all right posix specifies uh functions like make deer all right and uh for example but on windows"
4380300,4387180," such function will will be called underscore major um even though it has literally the same semantic as"
4387180,4391980," make deer on windows it's going to be called underscore make deer just because you"
4394380,4408700," yes um when should i use vd programming language over c i have no idea i'm not a specialist in your"
4408700,4418700," situation right so you are the one the one who knows your situation right and you are the one who has to"
4418700,4426780," make this kind of decision nobody can make these kind of decisions for you because nobody is an expert in"
4426780,4436140," you as much as you are right so yeah i know it's just like it's a question to you like when should you"
4436140,4442780," use d over c like i i don't know what's your situation uh well thank you so much for an exhaustive"
4442780,4448540," fans answer because you asked a good question so this is this is exactly what i'm talking about"
4448540,4471100," right you ask a good question you get a good answer um okay i'm gonna go to the kitchen and uh boil up some"
4478540,4508520," Thank you."
4508540,4538520," Thank you."
4538540,4557420," Okay, so I want to try to compile this into STF."
4557420,4561020," So the way..."
4561020,4564780," Yeah, I need to actually move this entire stuff like down below somewhere."
4564780,4571900," Spawn CMD."
4571900,4574540," I already moved it here."
4574540,4576820," Okay, spawn a pipe."
4576980,4579700," It has to be this thing."
4579700,4586980," I'm going to compile now."
4586980,4589700," Okay."
4589700,4591740," So still no panic."
4591740,4595980," Even though I'm pretty sure I defined panic..."
4595980,4597920," Where is it?"
4597920,4600740," Did I not..."
4600740,4603580," I think I'm going crazy."
4603580,4604320," Wait a second."
4604320,4607340," Okay."
4607340,4610260," Did I not fetch the latest changes that I did off screen?"
4610260,4611220," I think I didn't."
4611460,4619940," Because I remember that I introduced panic which essentially writes an error and also crashes the whole application."
4619940,4624040," So you don't have to separately put error and exit one, right?"
4624040,4627920," So it's just easier in case when you intend to just crash."
4628360,4633180," And what's cool about no build, by the way, in the majority of the situations, what we want to do, we just want to crash, right?"
4633180,4637680," We just want to fail the build and let the user to figure out what the hell happened."
4638820,4642900," Alright, so let me see what the hell is going on."
4642900,4645900," Maybe I just didn't fetch the latest stuff."
4645900,4649920," And I'm working on the fifth issue."
4649920,4652040," And as you know, I have a lot of issues."
4652040,4653380," Oh yeah, okay."
4653380,4654820," So I forgot to fetch the latest stuff."
4654820,4657120," I forgot to fetch the latest stuff."
4657120,4660120," Alright."
4660120,4661240," It's so late."
4661240,4666560," I still cannot get over that code."
4668820,4687260," Imagine being asked the question that you get really irritated by."
4687260,4694740," Still put a lot of effort to explain it properly and explain why you don't answer this kind of question."
4695060,4702240," The person keeps pushing and to the point where you get irritated and you are the problem."
4702240,4703820," You've got the issues."
4703820,4708520," You've got to explain that you don't want to answer this kind of question."
4708520,4710240," And no, fuck you."
4710240,4711360," You have the problems."
4711360,4712900," No, it's you."
4712900,4714180," Sure."
4714180,4717400," Anyway, I'm going to just form this up."
4717400,4717720," Okay."
4717720,4742900," Welcome to the internet, everyone."
4743800,4745140," I'll be your guide."
4745140,4756860," I visited Greece once and went into a music CD shop."
4756860,4761800," And was browsing to see what they have."
4761800,4763180," And the shop guy was like,"
4763180,4764500," This isn't a park."
4764500,4765860," Buy or get out."
4767300,4768200," I guess."
4768200,4769420," Maybe."
4769420,4772980," So."
4772980,4786820," But I mean, it's like, it's their private property."
4786820,4788620," You've come to their private property."
4789280,4792940," And they actually, you know, established the rules."
4792940,4793860," So."
4793860,4799740," And maybe the only reason why they can act like that is because everyone else act like that."
4799740,4801360," And you pretty much have no choice."
4801360,4802720," But, yeah."
4802720,4805840," I'm just going to buy the first thing I can grab."
4805840,4817520," Anyways."
4817520,4819600," Sauding."
4819600,4821060," Hello, Fufu Senga."
4821060,4823080," I hope I'm pronouncing them correctly."
4823080,4823400," Welcome."
4823400,4824320," How are you doing?"
4824320,4827280," Sauding."
4827280,4828480," Oh, shit."
4828480,4829160," It compiles."
4829160,4829920," Look at that."
4829920,4833180," Oh, this is because I haven't applied the changes yet."
4833360,4837120," Okay, it compiles because I haven't broken anything yet."
4837120,4838240," So that's the answer."
4838240,4840760," Just a second."
4840760,4842180," All right."
4842180,4842720," So."
4842720,4844580," Now."
4844580,4846820," I need to implement the piping."
4846820,4849480," Input output is not going to be 16."
4849480,4852320," Are you a web dev?"
4852320,4855140," Depends on the definition of web dev."
4855140,4856560," What is a web dev?"
4856560,4858980," Who is a web dev?"
4862160,4864380," So, it just depends on the definition, I would say."
4864380,4868000," According to some definitions, I am a web developer."
4868000,4870920," And according to other definitions, I'm not really a web developer."
4870920,4873020," So."
4873020,4881580," Devweb."
4881580,4882800," It's a dev."
4882800,4884360," It's actually a pretty cool device."
4884360,4884900," I'm not going to lie."
4884900,4893160," I was thinking about a very funny pun."
4893160,4900280," Has anyone ever, on Linux, created a device that is called ICE?"
4900280,4904860," So, the path to the device looks like device."
4904860,4907620," Has anyone ever created such a pun?"
4909280,4909780," Right."
4909780,4917380," You can literally actually, I don't know, some sort of like a kernel module that adds this device there."
4917500,4920680," And you have a dev.ice, which is a device."
4920680,4927680," I know it's dumb, but it's just, I don't know, I get a kick out of that."
4933260,4936200," And it's such a kind of like an obvious pun."
4936200,4938740," Like, I mean, somebody should have made it."
4938740,4940940," Or in some of the drivers, for example."
4940940,4942160," Or dev.alloper."
4942160,4942840," Yes, yes."
4942840,4945300," There's so many puns you can make with these device things."
4945300,4947360," Yeah."
4947360,4951480," It could be a freezer interface."
4951480,4951800," Yeah."
4951800,4953240," Devour."
4953240,4954220," Oh, shit."
4954220,4956920," It's like dev.null, but, you know, dev.null."
4958600,4960640," Yeah, you can get really creative with that."
4960640,4961160," Seriously."
4961160,4963500," Oh, shit."
4963500,4964460," Perfect."
4964460,4975740," Oh, name to adder, et cetera."
4975740,4976300," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
4976300,4977280," That's also fun."
4977280,4986000," If I ever going to create like a Linux driver, I'm definitely creating a dev.ice device."
4987280,4992080," All righty."
4992080,4996220," So, yeah, I need to create, I think, the branch 16."
4996220,4998360," I think it's 16."
4998360,4999280," Yes, it is 16."
4999280,5003240," And I'm gonna unstash my stash."
5003240,5006140," And it creates a merge conflict."
5006140,5009280," Why does it create a merge conflict?"
5009280,5010220," I'm not quite sure."
5010220,5014500," Why are you conflicting?"
5016860,5017640," I see."
5017640,5020200," This is because I removed this function."
5020200,5021100," It's not needed."
5021100,5026420," So, I guess the way to resolve this conflict is to actually remove everything related to this function."
5026420,5027380," It's pretty straightforward."
5027380,5028320," I'm not gonna lie, bro."
5028320,5031400," Is it gonna work now?"
5031400,5032920," I think it worked."
5032920,5033920," Look at that."
5033920,5035440," Epiku."
5035440,5036840," Epiku."
5036840,5037820," All right."
5038960,5041320," Why is everything in Unix abbreviated?"
5041320,5044200," Do Unix people have shady keyboards?"
5044200,5053600," They had shady terminals because at the time of creating Unix, there were terminals that send command over the network."
5053800,5060860," So, to minimize amount of send information, they were trying to make the commands shorter."
5060860,5066420," Like, generally, everything shorter, so they don't have to transfer too much information between the computers."
5067360,5071940," At least this is how Dennis explained it in one of his streams."
5071940,5074120," He actually explained it several times."
5074120,5079080," And that's primary reason why all these commanders are, like, short-cutted."
5079080,5080320," It's like a legacy thing."
5080320,5082140," These days, we don't really need to do that."
5084200,5086320," Network, fucking paper terminals."
5086320,5088320," Also, paper terminals, sure."
5088320,5090340," I guess."
5090340,5091260," Maybe."
5091260,5091780," Maybe."
5091780,5093460," Yeah, I think you're right."
5093460,5094200," I think I misunderstood."
5094200,5097340," Maybe to save on paper."
5097340,5097920," Who knows?"
5097920,5099040," So, it's..."
5099040,5100080," Yeah."
5100080,5105880," But the general answer, regardless of what it was, is basically legacy."
5105880,5107500," Yes."
5107500,5108920," So, the times were different."
5108920,5109920," The times were different."
5113880,5120680," Where can I see that?"
5120680,5123940," It's twitch.tv slash last miles."
5123940,5126300," Okay, just a second."
5126300,5130780," HTTPS twitch.tv slash last miles."
5130780,5132100," Yeah."
5132100,5134640," So, also, watch his trailer."
5134640,5137420," If you go to his channel, you will see his trailer."
5137420,5140340," I really recommend to watch his trailer to get the gist of his channel."
5140340,5141400," It's actually a pretty cool channel."
5143080,5144160," So, yeah."
5144160,5145200," I really recommend him."
5145200,5147400," Especially when he's sober."
5147400,5149140," Which is quite rare."
5149140,5153600," But when he's sober, he can actually, you know, tell a few cool stories."
5153600,5160160," Anyways."
5160160,5161400," So, is everything compiles?"
5165000,5182680," By the way, I have nothing against him drinking."
5182680,5184320," Just want to say."
5184320,5188720," Is that the problem when he gets drunk, he does less programming."
5189380,5190500," So, yeah."
5190500,5193120," I'm not telling to people what to do."
5193120,5194960," So, I personally don't drink at all."
5194960,5195380," Right?"
5195380,5198320," But then, don't tell other people how to live their life."
5198320,5200920," If you want to drink alcohol, it's just, you know, all power to you."
5200920,5206040," So, the thing is, why I don't like when Dennis is drunk is because when he's drunk, he does less programming."
5206280,5208080," And I'm more interested in programming."
5208080,5209540," So, yeah."
5209540,5214120," If he was doing more programming when he was drunk, I wouldn't say a thing."
5214120,5214480," Right?"
5214480,5215460," Just saying."
5215460,5220840," I thought that channel was, exactly."
5220840,5225620," Like, I usually come there for programming or for mathematics and stuff like that."
5225620,5235540," So, we don't approve of math, by the way."
5235540,5236880," All right."
5236880,5239860," So, let's continue."
5239860,5240320," Hmm."
5245460,5252940," But argument of the type is expected const char."
5252940,5254960," What am I doing?"
5254960,5256820," Is that, is that exactly P, really?"
5256820,5260360," I don't drink either."
5260360,5261240," Only T, cool."
5261240,5266440," So, I don't really."
5266440,5268720," Oh, it has to be exactly P, unfortunately."
5268720,5269380," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
5269380,5270120," I see what's going on."
5272460,5295360," So, and, yeah, now we're having a proper pointer situation, which I can reinterpret."
5299360,5305900," So, child size has no member, ah, it's actually chain size."
5305900,5316540," What the fuck?"
5316540,5319940," Cold object pipe is not a function."
5319940,5321020," Oh, shit."
5321020,5322820," Wait."
5322820,5325580," Do I have a pipe object somewhere?"
5325920,5326680," Oh, shit."
5326680,5328120," Fuck."
5328120,5329460," Fuck."
5329460,5333200," Can I do something like dash dash?"
5333200,5337440," Where's Jiayang?"
5337440,5339200," We need Jiayang in here."
5339200,5342600," So, why can't I do something like this?"
5342600,5344940," He probably already left."
5348280,5353460," I want to be able to do something like that."
5353460,5354600," Okay."
5354600,5355280," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
5355280,5357420," So, Jiayang, look, look, look, look."
5357420,5364560," Yeah, I cannot call object pipe because I already passed pipe as an argument."
5364560,5367800," And why can't I do something like this?"
5367800,5369920," I want to be able to do something like this."
5369920,5372760," Now I'm forced to come up with the name for this shit."
5374840,5379060," Classic, yeah, I know."
5379060,5381620," In C++, it would be so fucking easy."
5381620,5384160," Yeah, hold the volume from the global scope."
5384160,5384760," I mean, come on."
5384760,5386500," God damn it."
5386500,5388940," All right."
5388940,5390760," So, we'll have to come up with something else."
5390760,5392860," Peep."
5392860,5394320," This is what we're going to call it."
5394320,5395320," We're going to call it peep."
5395320,5401240," My pipe."
5401240,5403680," All right."
5403680,5408580," Cash pipe."
5408580,5411320," Why are we talking so much about drugs today?"
5411320,5412400," Is everything okay?"
5412400,5420720," If it's your pipe, it's a pipette."
5420720,5424880," Okay."
5432000,5435840," So, it's going to be my pipe chain size."
5435840,5445640," I'm a little bit hungry, chat."
5445640,5448000," Does anyone have any food?"
5448000,5451380," For an old Russian dude."
5455780,5459140," Now I can think of all the implications of my pipe."
5459140,5459720," My pipe."
5459720,5463420," I know only one pipe."
5463420,5465200," You have stew."
5465200,5465760," Nice."
5465760,5469240," Sends food over the pipe."
5469240,5469720," Thank you."
5469720,5471460," Thank you so much, everyone, for all of the food."
5471460,5473560," I really appreciate it."
5473560,5475800," The member chain."
5476560,5479240," Oh, it wants a point."
5479240,5484280," Did you make something work on FreeBSD yet again?"
5484280,5496900," Okay."
5496900,5498220," But so what?"
5498220,5500580," Did it create the device, though?"
5500780,5501600," Where is the device?"
5501600,5504880," All right."
5504880,5509140," I thought it's going to be like a dev eyes."
5509140,5512880," It's pretty impressive, but where is the dev eyes?"
5512880,5513720," I don't see it here."
5513720,5515600," Where is the dev eyes?"
5515600,5517000," There's no such thing."
5517000,5517480," I'm sorry."
5518800,5522620," It's pretty cool, but it's not a device."
5522620,5524740," Oh, it's not finished yet."
5524740,5525580," Oh, it's not."
5525580,5525900," Okay."
5525900,5529060," Why are you sending not finished code?"
5529060,5529840," Okay."
5529840,5530280," I see."
5530280,5530660," Cool."
5530660,5530960," Cool."
5530960,5531460," Thank you."
5531460,5531700," Thank you."
5531700,5535160," Let's continue compiling this thing."
5535160,5537080," So it's going to be my pipe."
5537080,5538620," Child size."
5538620,5540920," It's actually chain size, not child size."
5540920,5545540," Why are you still on part one?"
5545540,5546200," Yes."
5547200,5550820," Chain, chain."
5550820,5553260," Also a pointer."
5553260,5555000," Oh, shit."
5555000,5555680," It compiles."
5555680,5556620," Holy fuck."
5556620,5557960," Holy fuck."
5557960,5559560," Compose, mate."
5559560,5560840," Compose."
5560840,5572920," And as you know, chat, if it compiles, it works."
5572920,5574260," Okay."
5574320,5576860," What if you have like one chain in here?"
5576860,5577760," So what's going to happen?"
5577760,5579360," You're going to skip this entire shit."
5579360,5580400," Right."
5580400,5582160," Last is going to be equal to zero."
5582160,5586060," Then you set this thing."
5586060,5588720," Then last equal to zero."
5588720,5589800," And all of them is going to be null."
5589800,5591700," And it will just spawn everything as expected."
5591700,5592060," Okay."
5592060,5592740," Cool."
5593380,5595460," That's very fucking cool, mate."
5595460,5597660," Very fucking cool, mate."
5597660,5600440," So another thing."
5600440,5603580," Now I want to test this shit somehow."
5603580,5605980," Now I want to test."
5605980,5610100," So I'm going to have a pipe."
5610100,5612880," And I already have this function."
5613280,5628360," So we need a way to construct a new CMD."
5634500,5637440," We want a marketable product, not actual progress."
5637440,5638760," Yes."
5638760,5647100," This is essentially stream, right?"
5647100,5648780," So yeah."
5648780,5653900," If you want a stream, you always have to show a marketable product, not the progress."
5654140,5656760," If you just show your progress, nobody gives a shit about it."
5656760,5659440," And everyone will ask you, why your code is not finished?"
5659440,5661240," Why are you fucking showing not finished code?"
5661240,5661900," What the fuck?"
5661900,5663080," Where is the finished product?"
5663080,5664820," Why is it not finished in five minutes?"
5664820,5666060," The fuck?"
5666060,5670180," I'm learning a Go language."
5670180,5672000," This one?"
5672000,5677380," Go language."
5677380,5682560," Has anyone tried Go Explanation Marky Language, by the way?"
5683560,5688740," So when the language Go came out, there was a little bit of controversy."
5688740,5692920," Because of the Go exclamation mark language."
5692920,5698340," And I think that language died, literally, after Go came out."
5698340,5701240," Well, it was already dead, as far as I know."
5701240,5706600," Go exclamation mark language."
5706600,5710200," It doesn't exist anymore."
5710200,5711380," I see."
5711380,5712720," Was it renamed to something?"
5712980,5715640," Probably."
5715640,5717040," Sure."
5717040,5718000," Whatever."
5718000,5721620," Yet another dead language."
5721620,5730700," What did you just clip?"
5730700,5732960," Did you clip that thing?"
5741260,5744220," And everyone will ask you, why your code is not finished?"
5744220,5746060," Why are you fucking showing not finished code?"
5746060,5746720," What the fuck?"
5746720,5747860," Where is the finished product?"
5747860,5749620," Why is it not finished in five minutes?"
5749620,5750840," The fuck?"
5750840,5754600," Thank you so much for clipping that."
5756520,5758160," Oh, there's a name in the same thing."
5758160,5761980," Oh, there's a name in dispute."
5761980,5762560," Oh, okay."
5762560,5763480," I'm over with it."
5763480,5763820," I'm sorry."
5763820,5768580," So I need a way to construct the CMD."
5768580,5770620," So you can spawn a CMD."
5770620,5773700," Let's actually try to build a CMD."
5775140,5785140," So I'm going to introduce a function called CMD, no build, make CMD."
5785140,5793520," And this thing is going to accept probably ignored thing here or something like that we don't give a shit about."
5793760,5794740," Something like ignore."
5794740,5798480," And then it's going to be like this."
5798480,5799200," There we go."
5799200,5802300," Let's quickly implement this entire stuff."
5808480,5809360," I'm just thinking."
5809360,5812080," Yeah, I should less think."
5812080,5813280," I should think less."
5813280,5814220," That's for sure."
5814220,5818460," Because every time I start thinking, I'm wasting time and not implementing anything."
5818460,5819460," So I should stop thinking."
5819460,5820560," All right."
5820560,5829560," So VA list args for each VA arg."
5829560,5830380," Okay."
5830380,5831860," So the parameter is ignore."
5831860,5834300," Then args."
5834300,5835580," And here is the body."
5835580,5837520," Cool."
5838480,5839400," Okay."
5839400,5843040," First, we need to count them."
5843040,5847160," Because we'll need to put them on the list."
5847160,5849060," So it's going to be zero."
5849060,5852340," You know what?"
5852340,5856240," I do this shit so many times."
5856240,5862800," Why haven't I extracted that as a separate function?"
5862800,5864060," If you know what I mean."
5864060,5866420," So I do this thing over and over again."
5866420,5872360," where I transform variadic argument list into array of sisters."
5872360,5875180," Like I do that so fucking often."
5875180,5877720," Why don't I have a function for that?"
5877720,5878940," You know what I mean, chat?"
5883580,5887700," I'm not actually sure if you mean to auto-complete or the dev-ice project."
5887700,5888240," Oh, okay."
5888240,5889700," It's Anasov."
5889700,5890220," Hello."
5890220,5891840," Welcome to the stream."
5891840,5893080," Welcome, welcome, welcome."
5893080,5894440," How are you doing, buddy?"
5898160,5899120," Hey, it's Sodink."
5899120,5900280," Recent follower here."
5900280,5901540," What are you building today?"
5901540,5904280," I'm building a build system."
5904280,5907200," Building a build system."
5907200,5908040," Welcome."
5908040,5911020," I welcome all of the new followers here."
5920600,5923700," Nice way to introduce yourself into a new community."
5923700,5925680," Keep it up."
5925680,5927040," Proud of you."
5927040,5930500," Piping hot build systems."
5930500,5931140," Yes, exactly."
5933780,5935540," You didn't follow me when I followed."
5935540,5935960," Exactly."
5935960,5939620," So, what I want you to do."
5939620,5941060," I want you to have a function."
5941060,5945040," Something like const char."
5947340,5948620," VA args."
5948620,5950800," Actually, no build."
5950800,5953660," VA args to array."
5953660,5957240," And essentially, it's going to just do the following thing."
5957240,5965620," Is it possible in C preprocessor, by the way, to get the amount of variadic arguments?"
5965620,5966500," Oh, my God."
5966500,5967780," Preprocessor."
5967780,5970460," VA args size."
5970460,5972020," Is it possible?"
5972020,5973220," It should be possible."
5973220,5976480," It must be."
5977340,5979440," P-P-P-P-P-R-S-E-C."
5979440,5985940," Well, this is dumb."
5985940,5997040," I mean, what's so difficult to do something like VA args len?"
5997040,6002660," C preprocessor knows about it."
6002660,6005420," Otherwise, it will be able to function properly."
6005420,6007900," Why not just give this information to the user?"
6007900,6009360," Can you give me?"
6009360,6010600," Can you give it to me?"
6010600,6012480," It's a compile time information."
6012480,6013340," Just give it to me."
6013340,6016540," So, Zhiyang, do you know anything about that?"
6016540,6017680," Do you know anything about that?"
6017680,6019400," So, C-P-P-P is so dumb."
6019400,6021660," That's why I rented the other day."
6021660,6022680," Oh, I see."
6022680,6026340," With an ugly file."
6026420,6029880," So, basically, you should know the upper limit of..."
6029880,6030840," This is so dumb."
6030840,6032640," This is so dumb."
6032640,6033980," Like, I mean, it's..."
6033980,6037400," The information is literally known by the C preprocessor."
6037400,6039640," You know that information."
6039640,6041680," Otherwise, you just couldn't be able to function."
6041680,6042900," And yet..."
6042900,6043840," Chat."
6045700,6047900," Why am I wasting my time on this language?"
6063420,6065580," Is that something recursive or something?"
6065580,6074700," Well, I know exactly why I'm wasting my time on this language."
6074700,6077280," Because there's not that many alternatives to this."
6080160,6081860," Except Jai, but Jai doesn't exist."
6081860,6082480," Anyway."
6082480,6083360," So."
6083360,6086340," I will probably have to do this kind of shit."
6086340,6088180," It's like..."
6088180,6091220," And these kind of things actually force you to..."
6091220,6094280," Make a less performant code."
6094280,6095520," Like, it's just like..."
6095520,6097440," It forces you to have a less performant code."
6097440,6100060," Alright."
6100060,6101080," So, this is what I want."
6101080,6103200," Instead of build..."
6103200,6104560," I want to have this kind of thing."
6104560,6105660," No build."
6105660,6109960," C-star-va-args-to-array."
6110440,6110840," Right."
6110840,6111400," So."
6111400,6113480," And essentially..."
6113480,6118220," You can turn va-args-to-array."
6118220,6119360," And..."
6119360,6119620," Yeah."
6119620,6120440," I want to be able to do that."
6120440,6124880," What is overhaul?"
6124880,6125940," I don't know what it is."
6125940,6126320," I'm sorry."
6126320,6130140," You could be fighting with the rest compoter instead."
6130140,6133320," Yes."
6133320,6133600," Sure."
6133600,6139220," Okay."
6139460,6140960," So, I'm going to just do that."
6140960,6142680," Alright."
6142680,6144780," And essentially, what I want to be able to do is..."
6144780,6146780," For each va-args-to-array."
6146780,6148180," We are sister."
6148180,6148780," Can I..."
6148780,6150840," Uh-huh."
6150840,6158180," So, parameter is ignore-args."
6158180,6161340," And then I just put this thing here."
6161340,6164180," Va-list-args."
6164180,6169200," And of course, I need to do count."
6169200,6175620," So, it could be actually something very interesting."
6175620,6178720," So, maybe I could provide the count there."
6178720,6179900," Like a pointer to the count."
6179900,6181220," But I didn't think it's that useful."
6181220,6183260," So, it's going to be like this."
6183260,6185960," And we're going to just put the count plus one in here."
6187060,6187620," Alright."
6187620,6191300," And then, once I know the count, I can allocate some more memory."
6191300,6192360," Right."
6192360,6195700," It's going to be const char result."
6195700,6199860," I want to allocate size of const char."
6199860,6205260," Count plus one for an additional null pointer."
6206260,6209480," And then, I'm going to reset count to zero."
6209480,6213540," And I'm going to iterate this entire shit one more time."
6213540,6215380," Result."
6215380,6219120," Plus plus."
6219120,6220280," Arg."
6220280,6221900," Send it to arg."
6221900,6224520," Then, result count."
6224520,6226160," It's going to be equal to null."
6226160,6228960," And I'm just returning the result."
6228960,6239880," So, this way, I can transform variadic array of sisters to an array of sisters."
6239880,6242660," And this is actually something that I use every time."
6242660,6243580," Like, all the time."
6243580,6246260," Alright."
6246260,6248500," So, let me see."
6248500,6251380," Now, if I want to build a CMD."
6251380,6251980," Alright."
6251980,6255420," If I want to build a CMD, I don't have to worry about that."
6255420,6256280," Right."
6256280,6258600," Right."
6258960,6260880," Well, maybe I do have to worry about that."
6260880,6270180," Because I cannot just easily pass this thing in there."
6270180,6280340," Oh, GatorLow went on the rent."
6280340,6283420," I think the problem is that CPP doesn't expand macro circumstances."
6283420,6285680," So, it's impossible to have a real solution."
6285680,6286140," Yeah."
6286140,6288620," It's just so old."
6288620,6289800," Oh, the holy shits."
6289800,6298220," If I haven't coded it in C for like two years, the Vietnam flashbacks are coming."
6298220,6300340," So, you programmed in C in Vietnam."
6300340,6301700," Interesting."
6309700,6319300," It just makes it difficult."
6319300,6323960," It just makes it difficult to do interesting things."
6329960,6333720," Can you put count plus plus plus instead of count plus equal one?"
6333720,6334780," Yes, I can do that."
6334780,6339420," So, I need to implement this function."
6339420,6340300," Sure."
6342300,6344140," But, but that means I don't have a very attitude."
6344140,6344240," But that means I don't have a very attitude."
6344240,6345160," Oh, my God."
6345160,6346940," It just doesn't, it doesn't fly."
6346940,6350800," It just doesn't fly easily."
6350800,6356820," But, you can always replace that make CMD, right?"
6357360,6362800," So, with some sort of a macro, make CMD, which accepts this kind of thing."
6362800,6368960," And then you can do something like CMD, args is equal, no sister."
6368960,6377680," All right, ignore is going to be 69 and it's just VAR, isn't that cool?"
6377680,6379860," And, of course, you can put a null in here."
6379860,6381160," That's, that's true."
6381160,6383920," That is true."
6383920,6388520," So, you can do it like that, which is absolutely dumb, but you can do that."
6388520,6391120," Right."
6391120,6394180," You can do it like that."
6398960,6420760," Why not create array directly in macro without additional function call?"
6425260,6427220," Didn't, isn't what I just did?"
6427220,6431860," Or maybe you don't really explain yourself very well."
6431860,6434560," Whatever, bike shooting."
6434560,6436080," Don't care."
6436080,6437300," Cool."
6437300,6442760," So, speaking of pipe now."
6442760,6448100," So, here is the."
6448100,6454660," Here is the thing."
6455260,6462180," I just want to test this entire stuff."
6462180,6464800," Is there a command that generates stuff?"
6464800,6465780," I think there is."
6465780,6469180," So, you can do it like sec 10."
6469180,6469840," Yeah."
6469840,6474360," Then you can pipe it into reverse."
6474360,6477920," And, yeah, that was interesting."
6477920,6478260," Okay."
6478260,6482380," Yeah, you can do something like that."
6482380,6491700," And maybe then you can do something like this, which is kind of dumb, but I guess this is one"
6491700,6492540," way to test that."
6492540,6496840," Yeah, I guess this is one way to test that."
6496840,6497180," Sure."
6497180,6500300," And let me see how we can test that."
6502300,6523220," So, I need to create a cmd chain."
6523220,6524560," All right, cmd chain."
6524560,6526760," And in that chain, we're going to do what?"
6526760,6530240," I'm going to do args."
6530240,6533180," No build."
6536260,6536960," Uh-huh."
6536960,6538880," Let's go with 69."
6538880,6545920," Sec 10."
6545920,6547820," All right."
6547820,6550480," Then we're going to have a reverse."
6550480,6554100," Actually, not reverse, but sort rn."
6563300,6564020," Mm-hmm."
6564020,6568140," Okay."
6568140,6572260," So, this is the chain."
6572260,6574500," After that, you can create a pipe."
6574500,6577220," All right."
6577220,6578100," So, my pipe."
6578100,6578840," I have to call it."
6578840,6580380," Pipe."
6580380,6586400," It took over three decades to fix a stupid parsing quirk that didn't allow you to close."
6586400,6587980," Yeah, I do remember that, actually."
6588980,6590340," So, it is dumb."
6590340,6593720," Chain, chain."
6593720,6596600," And also, chain size."
6596600,6598680," Size of chain."
6598680,6602440," Divided by size of chain."
6602440,6602980," Zero."
6602980,6604040," Okay."
6604040,6605140," So, this is my pipe."
6605140,6608620," Cool."
6608620,6611620," And let me do..."
6611620,6613880," Pt, cpit."
6616880,6617900," Uh-huh."
6617900,6621880," No build."
6621880,6622940," Spawn."
6622940,6625200," Pipe."
6625200,6626000," Spawn."
6626000,6626440," Pipe."
6626440,6629440," And I just do my pipe."
6629440,6632020," And this entire thing just gives me this entire stuff."
6632020,6636260," So, I'm going to iterate through all of the chains."
6636260,6637320," So, all of the pids."
6637320,6642000," Through all of the pids."
6642000,6643220," My pipe."
6643220,6648400," Chainsize."
6648400,6649800," Plus, plus, plus, I."
6649800,6652860," Uh, no build."
6652860,6654880," POSIX."
6654880,6658360," Uh..."
6658360,6662360," Hmm..."
6662360,6666000," Cpd's I."
6666000,6667360," And that's it."
6667680,6672060," So, this is going to be the way we just test the pipe."
6672060,6673900," Uh..."
6673900,6676520," Let's try to build and run all of this."
6676520,6680380," It worked."
6688520,6689620," So, you see?"
6689620,6693780," Without the additional command, it works like this."
6693780,6695320," But then I can reverse it."
6695320,6696240," I can sort it."
6696240,6697700," Uh..."
6697700,6699560," And on top of that, I can add another command."
6699560,6701800," For example, wc-l."
6701800,6702800," Right?"
6702800,6704740," And, uh..."
6704740,6708160," It will print the amount of words."
6708160,6712160," So, you can actually add as many chains as you want."
6712160,6713540," So, yeah."
6713740,6716700," So, here's the thing that works, actually."
6716700,6717600," Would you look at that?"
6717600,6723640," So, what else can we do?"
6723640,6725440," Do we have any interesting..."
6725440,6727760," Interesting things to do?"
6727760,6732860," We might as well actually do something like sequence from 100 to 110."
6733860,6735480," Yeah, I think this is what we can do."
6735480,6738180," 100 and 110."
6738180,6739940," Right?"
6739940,6742180," So, then I can sort in the reverse."
6742180,6745120," And then I can reverse each individual line."
6745120,6746940," So, uh..."
6746940,6749560," We might as well start like this."
6749560,6750080," Right?"
6750080,6752240," Okay."
6752240,6754420," So, as you can see, we managed to call this thing."
6754420,6755700," It seems to be working."
6755700,6758080," Then I'm sorting everything."
6760860,6763060," Yeah, I'm sorting in the reverse."
6763060,6765380," And then I reversed each individual line."
6765380,6767340," Okay."
6767340,6769560," So, each individual line has been reversed."
6769560,6770900," And we can add another thing."
6770900,6772700," Base64 encoder."
6772700,6773260," Right?"
6773260,6774240," Just to encode everything."
6774240,6776280," Yeah."
6776280,6779120," And this line was properly encoded."
6779120,6781180," Okay."
6781180,6783040," And we can keep adding things."
6783040,6785760," For example, we can try to zip this entire stuff."
6785760,6788380," But I don't think it's going to look great."
6789020,6791220," Yeah, data not written to a terminal."
6791220,6792840," Use F to force the compression."
6792840,6793860," Ah, okay."
6793860,6794300," That's cool."
6794300,6796220," So, I can add the compression here."
6796220,6800160," And it wrote some garbage in here."
6800160,6802800," So, to fix that, we'll have to do..."
6802800,6805960," Hex dump minus C."
6805960,6808380," And there we go."
6808380,6813380," So, and all of that actually works."
6813380,6816420," So, yeah, you literally describe the pipe like that."
6816420,6818380," And it actually pipes everything."
6818380,6819920," And everything works correctly."
6819920,6820580," Holy shit."
6820580,6822700," Yeah."
6822700,6826680," So, now we just need to wrap all of that into a nice interface."
6826680,6827740," That's what we need to do."
6827740,6831240," That's actually pretty cool."
6835640,6841460," Yeah, on top of that, I forgot to implement the functionality that reads from file."
6841460,6845340," The input from file and outputs to the file."
6845340,6848840," So, yeah, we need to implement that."
6848840,6852540," Okay."
6853360,6856700," So, this is a previous readfd."
6856700,6861360," And this is going to be kind of complicated because..."
6861360,6863720," Yeah."
6865780,6878120," Well, essentially, if you provided input, if you provided input file, for you, prev.read.read.fd should exist."
6878120,6880840," It should exist for you."
6880840,6883280," So, let's actually try to do something like that."
6883280,6891020," If my pipe input file path, if it does exist, right?"
6894140,6896580," If it does exist..."
6896580,6906480," So, we also need to do a thing that indicates that you either have a previous readfd or don't have a previous readfd."
6906480,6910780," So, maybe because of that, it has to be a pointer."
6910780,6914880," So, here is a previous readfd, right?"
6914880,6916480," So, initially, it's null."
6916480,6921840," And essentially, if we're going to do it like that, right?"
6921840,6923280," If we're going to do it like that."
6924140,6937040," We may just do things like this."
6937040,6937840," Oh, shit."
6937840,6940700," I think I should first refactor it slightly differently."
6940700,6941040," Yay."
6941040,6945000," So, I'm going to move this stuff here."
6945000,6947140," So, now it's available to everyone."
6949140,6958100," Then, if previous readfd is available, you're just going to use that."
6958100,6959220," Nothing special."
6959220,6963400," You're only going to close this thing if it is available."
6963400,6965620," Like that."
6965620,6967960," Uh-huh."
6967960,6972260," And this thing, we use it as a pointer."
6972700,6976600," But then, it will be overwritten by the next pipefd call."
6976600,6983560," So, because of that, we need to have a place where we store this entire thing."
6983560,6986940," So, previous readfd."
6989440,6994120," I don't know how to call it, because this is just a pointer, right?"
6994120,6999220," I might as well call this entire thing."
6999220,7002540," Uh-huh."
7005060,7007380," I might as well call this entire thing."
7007380,7012780," Fd previous."
7012780,7015500," Fd previous."
7015500,7018400," Uh-huh."
7018400,7022500," And"
7022500,7024900," funny enough."
7024900,7027720," Uh-huh."
7027720,7027720," Uh-huh."
7031060,7037280," I need a name for this thing."
7037280,7039760," Fd previous."
7039760,7041420," Place."
7041420,7043340," Uh-huh."
7043340,7044680," It's going to start here."
7044680,7045940," And"
7045940,7048720," essentially,"
7048720,7052140," fd previous is going to be pointed to fd previous place."
7052140,7054060," Fd previous place."
7054060,7055960," And then, I take the fd previous place."
7055960,7058400," And I store the zero there."
7058400,7059580," There we go."
7060900,7061700," Um."
7061700,7063120," Cool."
7063120,7072100," Uh-huh."
7072100,7073820," It also could be something like fd"
7073820,7076100," in."
7076100,7080060," Uh-huh."
7080060,7087620," This is complicated."
7087620,7088120," Right."
7088120,7090460," But, I mean, that could work eventually."
7090740,7091960," All right."
7091960,7095100," So, and then, we have a fd previous fd."
7095100,7096900," We don't have that thing anymore."
7096900,7098780," Uh, right."
7098780,7101860," So, uh, we're going to just use fdprev."
7101860,7103640," Uh-huh."
7103640,7105000," And similarly,"
7105000,7107940," if you do have fdprev,"
7107940,7109620," you just close it like this."
7109620,7110840," All right."
7110840,7113620," So, this could be a very useful refactoring."
7114340,7119860," This could be a very useful refactoring because then later it will enable us with introducing"
7119860,7124420," the, the end files, uh, of printing outputting."
7124420,7127200," So, uh, yeah, that's kind of cool."
7127560,7129840," And it didn't break anything, which is kind of weird."
7129840,7131360," Like, let me try to break the code."
7131360,7132000," Uh, okay."
7132000,7132860," So, it worked."
7132860,7134380," All right."
7134380,7135220," It seems to be working."
7135220,7140420," So, if I try to go to the pipe and I remove some of these things in here, will it still work?"
7141200,7142540," Uh, yeah, it still works."
7142540,7144180," It still prints this pipe in here."
7144180,7148280," So, if I put the rest of this thing, uh, yeah, it still works."
7148280,7148560," Cool."
7148560,7152740," It's pretty interesting."
7152740,7154820," All right."
7154820,7156760," Uh, so, now."
7156760,7158920," Mm-hmm."
7158920,7159420," Mm-hmm."
7159420,7164480," Uh, first try."
7164480,7166720," Yeah, it's kind of sus, but it is what it is."
7167180,7177140," Uh, if my pipe input file path, if my pipe input file path, uh, that means we're going"
7177140,7181880," to do FD in open, uh, we open this file, right?"
7181880,7186200," We open this file for open vronly, right?"
7186200,7191680," Uh, actually vronly or vronly, right?"
7191680,7195300," So, in FFD in is less than zero."
7195300,7196640," That means we did a fucky-wacky."
7196720,7198220," So, we need to panic."
7198220,7202380," Could not open file this because of this."
7202380,7207080," And, uh, the file is my pipe input file path."
7207080,7212520," And, uh, the thing is a stir error, right?"
7212520,7213240," A stir error."
7213240,7214760," Error no."
7214760,7215940," All right."
7215940,7220060," So, and after that, we're going to do FD prev pointer to FD in."
7220060,7225660," So, you see, essentially, um, we don't have to have a special case whether we're"
7225660,7233320," last, um, whether we are, uh, first element in the chain or not first element in the chain."
7233320,7239520," So, uh, essentially, if you have an input file, you still have a special previous value for"
7239520,7241560," the, for the input, for the first chain anyway."
7242160,7246300," Uh, so now, if I try to compile this entire thing, it seems to be working."
7246300,7250160," So, but now, I want to try to do the following thing."
7250160,7254920," Uh, I'm going to use just sort."
7254920,7258580," Uh, yeah, I'm going to just remove this entire thing."
7258580,7259480," It's just going to be sort."
7261960,7270940," Uh, so here is the just sort, but instead of, uh, having sequence, I'm going to set input"
7270940,7279200," file, input file path to be examples, uh, pipe C, right?"
7279200,7285180," So now, examples pipe C will be piped into sort, uh, and that should still work."
7285180,7286460," And it did."
7286460,7291040," As you can see here, the source code, uh, of this thing, uh, and it was sorted."
7291040,7294900," On top of that, we can go ahead and keep piping things."
7294900,7296360," We can enable reversing."
7296420,7298580," And now each individual line has been reversed."
7298580,7304660," So maybe I should actually go to the build in here and disable everything except the pipe."
7304660,7306440," Should be pretty straightforward."
7306440,7308240," Uh, right."
7308240,7313940," Because essentially I can just check an example, which is pipe.c, right?"
7313940,7315620," And only we're going to see the pipe example."
7315620,7316040," There we go."
7316040,7319640," So, and in the pipe, uh, I can keep adding things."
7319640,7323180," I can now encode myself with base 64."
7323620,7326660," And after that, I can gzip this entire thing."
7326660,7332420," Uh, and the thing, oh shit, it, it was properly gzipped, but I mean, it's just the terminal"
7332420,7333440," cannot properly show it."
7333440,7338520," And then to make it a human readable, I'm going to pipe it through the hex dump, right?"
7338520,7341240," And once it pipes through the hex dump, uh, it looks like this."
7341240,7344000," And all of that is done via C, right?"
7344000,7345300," All of that is done via C."
7345300,7349440," Now we need to be able to maybe specify something like output file path."
7350700,7354040," Um, but that could be interesting."
7354040,7357740," So it was going to be, uh, output TXT, right?"
7357740,7359800," So we want to be able to do this kind of stuff."
7359800,7369200," Uh, so, uh, cool."
7371640,7373140," Uh, how we're going to do that."
7373140,7377160," So we have a previous one."
7377160,7380540," Ah, and the last one is going to be the output."
7380540,7381020," Okay."
7381020,7392000," Now, if, uh, my pipe, uh, output file path, if it has output file path, um, we're going to"
7392000,7393900," set something interesting here, right?"
7394440,7407240," Um, FD next, actually, it should be FD out, I suppose, FD out, FD next, which is a pointer"
7407240,7408520," and it's initially zero."
7408520,7410280," Right."
7410280,7420880," So, and, uh, we're opening this thing here for, oh yeah."
7420880,7430740," I need to open it in a very specific way, um, to, to, to, to, to, I need to open it in a very"
7430740,7431520," specific way."
7431520,7433060," This is how I need to open it."
7433060,7439540," Uh, this is how I need to open it."
7439540,7445100," And the, uh, we have to use the file that is this stuff."
7445100,7450480," Okay."
7450480,7453600," So it's then zero."
7453600,7455080," It's going to be like that."
7455080,7456460," And it's going to be panic."
7456460,7461740," Could not open file this because of this."
7462160,7472020," And, um, um, Emacs, come on my pipe output file path and, uh, STR error, error."
7472020,7473120," No, cool."
7473120,7481480," So, and then, uh, after that I can set up FD next as a pointer to FD out."
7481480,7482300," Right."
7482300,7484920," And then I can just use FD, uh, next."
7484920,7488780," And this is actually symmetrically works out really well."
7488940,7493220," So there's a weird symmetry to what I'm to actually compose in the pipe."
7493220,7497340," There's a really weird symmetry, but I think it works out really well."
7497340,7502880," Uh, after that, uh, I think we also need to close the FD next if it's present."
7502880,7505940," If it's present, we have to close it."
7505940,7507640," Cool."
7507640,7510220," So that's actually super fucking cool."
7512220,7521280," Uh, maybe I can even set up FD next like this somehow."
7521280,7526540," And that's actually a very interesting idea, but I mean, it's already kind of, kind of works."
7526540,7527880," All right."
7527880,7529280," So, uh, let me see."
7529280,7530060," All right."
7530060,7534220," So pipe has been executed and it outputted everything to, uh, output text in."
7534860,7535320," All right."
7535320,7537920," So now we have a full pipe functionality."
7537920,7538640," Holy shit."
7538640,7545580," We have a full pipe functionality, uh, where you can set up input file, output file, and the"
7545580,7550160," programs in between, and it will just execute everything and will just work for you."
7550160,7554420," Uh, so now we need to wrap that into easier to use interface."
7556580,7567120," Uh, I had to write a kernel driver once."
7567120,7568080," It was kind of weird."
7568080,7570600," I haven't written a kernel driver ever."
7570600,7575640," So, and I'm thinking that it will be actually kind of cool content for the stream, but I'm"
7575640,7578280," kind of worried that it may kill the stream."
7578280,7580780," So I'll have to write drivers in a virtual machine."
7581100,7585860," So when, I don't know, setting up a virtual machine could be like too much of a pain for,"
7585860,7586720," for my setup."
7586720,7590760," Sometimes once it crashed, I couldn't get the machine to shut down properly."
7590760,7591060," Yeah."
7591060,7597100," Uh, it's kind of dangerous to develop drivers for on your own machine on which you're developing."
7597100,7599200," So it should be kind of like a separate machine completely."
7599200,7609280," Uh, I think, uh, there's a challenge by some compressioner that gives you a list of, uh, 100k"
7609280,7616800," random numbers and if you can loosely compress it by even one byte, uh, you win 69 dollars."
7616800,7620220," Oh, that's actually a pretty interesting challenge."
7620220,7626020," So basically he cramps like a shit ton of entropy in it, right?"
7626020,7628940," So, yeah, that's interesting."
7628940,7634640," How did it compile with a random A?"
7634640,7635240," It didn't."
7638240,7651140," Is ctrl A some kind of a safe file shortcut or something?"
7651140,7651900," Ctrl A?"
7651900,7654300," It doesn't do anything for me."
7654300,7657720," Uh, so if you want to try it."
7657720,7658660," No, I don't want to try it."
7658660,7660020," I don't really care about this kind of stuff."
7660020,7661460," Uh."
7667300,7671560," To be fair, like, I don't care about the challenges."
7671560,7674100," Like, if you do this thing, I will give you money."
7674100,7675380," Uh, dub, dub, dub."
7675380,7676980," Are you cool enough to do that?"
7676980,7679540," Uh, I don't give a shit about this thing for some reason."
7679540,7690060," Uh, so it's like, no, you wouldn't try to hold that competition if you knew, uh, if you"
7690060,7692520," didn't know whether somebody is going to win that or not."
7692560,7694560," So what's the point of me wasting my time?"
7694560,7698860," I'd rather waste my, uh, I'd rather spend my time on doing something more productive, right?"
7698860,7704060," So, like, you literally, the only reason why you're holding this competition is that because"
7704060,7706680," you know people cannot win it."
7706680,7710080," Or is it difficult, extremely difficult to win?"
7710160,7714300," And you know that there is a really, like, a little probability of you losing money."
7714300,7716980," It's like, literally, by definition."
7716980,7719680," Why should I waste my time on that?"
7719680,7726020," So, again, like, every time I see something like that in my brain, it's just,"
7726020,7728680," come on, do you think I'm that dumb?"
7728840,7732120," No, I'd rather spend my time on something really productive."
7732120,7741100," Well, it's an interesting idea."
7741100,7743480," It's an interesting idea."
7743480,7745280," It's not an interesting competition."
7745280,7747320," It's an interesting idea."
7747320,7748000," Right."
7748000,7751580," So, but that's it."
7751580,7757720," I didn't mean that I find it interesting to participate in this special Olympiad or something."
7757720,7758140," I don't know."
7758140,7766640," But I've got issues, you know that."
7766640,7768080," So maybe that's the problem."
7768080,7778940," Of course, issues, yes."
7781580,7783160," Okay, so that's pretty cool."
7783160,7784840," I really like this syntax."
7784840,7788960," Tissues."
7788960,7790420," You've got tissues."
7790420,7794600," I've got tissues."
7794600,7797320," Monka TOS time."
7797320,7797760," I'm sorry."
7797760,7799240," What's up, Jabobob?"
7799240,7799780," How are you doing?"
7799780,7805040," Oh, I forgot to remove this thing, I think."
7810140,7810980," Oh, shit."
7810980,7811960," He's got tissues."
7811960,7813220," Everyone hide."
7813220,7819500," Alright, so I want to remove that."
7819500,7826840," Cool."
7826840,7830440," I don't think I want to do this thing."
7838560,7842160," So, we still don't have the STD error functionality."
7842160,7845700," But what are we going to do with the STD error, though?"
7845700,7850240," No, it should be pretty straightforward."
7850240,7854660," I guess, it depends on how you're going to do that."
7854660,7864520," And also, sometimes you want to do things like redirect STD error to STD out, right?"
7864580,7866100," Just basically merge them together."
7866100,7868900," Yeah."
7868900,7872360," And we should be able to handle all of that."
7872360,7874560," But we're going to put that as a separate issue."
7874560,7875700," I already created a separate issue."
7879200,7879740," All right."
7879740,7881360," So, what do we got?"
7881360,7882420," What do we got?"
7882420,7886100," Let me commit this into, I think."
7886100,7897280," Implement a working pipe functionality on Linux."
7897280,7898800," On POSIX, rather."
7900800,7902140," Let's push that right into the RIP one."
7902140,7907080," Maze, MazeLow90, hello, welcome to the stream."
7907080,7912340," I want to make a small break, so I'm going to just make a cup of tea, I guess."
7912340,7913100," I'm not sure."
7923600,7937600," Just looking for something interesting to answer in the chat."
7937600,7947280," How everyone is doing, by the way?"
7947280,7957120," I'm a little bit hungry."
7957120,7962280," So, I don't know for how long I'll be able to continue streaming."
7962280,7970300," Interesting, there is no POSIX program to merge two streams into one."
7971240,7973140," Like, tea, but in reverse."
7973140,7974260," Huh."
7974260,7977160," This is because you can..."
7977160,7979700," Maybe you cannot."
7979700,7980300," Okay."
7980300,7981840," Doing well, nice."
7981840,7982880," Really glad to hear that."
7982880,7986000," Opinions on green tea."
7986000,7989420," I don't know."
7989420,7995540," I personally don't drink it."
7995540,7997440," But it exists."
7997440,7997500," I don't know."
8001240,8001740," I don't know."
8001740,8003580," All right."
8003580,8006140," So, I think I'm going to also make a small break."
8006140,8008100," Because I need to pee and stuff like that."
8008100,8013920," Small break."
8013920,8016140," Nice."
8016140,8025700," All right."
8025700,8026680," Let's make a small break."
8026680,8027880," And you guys have fun."
8031240,8061220," Thank you."
8061240,8091220," Thank you."
8091240,8121220," Thank you."
8121240,8151220," Thank you."
8151240,8181220," Thank you."
8181240,8211220," Thank you."
8211220,8218020," So, this is basically how we're going to do all of that."
8220420,8223080," So, the idea here is going to be the following."
8223080,8239060," You will do the pipe, all right, in examples, examples, pipe.c, then you chain it into sort rn,"
8239060,8269040," and then you chain it into reverse base64, base64, gzip-f, hexdump-c, and then you want to output that to the..."
8269040,8284780," By the way, so you also have to use path.c, so this is supposed to be the intended syntax for this entire stuff."
8284780,8290640," So, basically, we need to implement a bunch of macros to facilitate this kind of thing."
8292220,8302020," And once we've got that, I think it is going to work appropriately."
8302020,8302540," Okay, so my kettle is ready."
8302540,8305360," I'm going to quickly pour some water and I'm going to be back."
8305360,8307220," I'm going to be back, so I'm going to be back, so I'm going to be back."
8307220,8307740," So, I'm going to be back, so I'm going to be back, so I'm going to be back."
8307740,8308160," So, I'm going to be back, so I'm going to be back."
8308160,8309560," So, I'm going to be back, so I'm going to be back."
8309560,8310560," So, I'm going to be back, so I'm going to be back."
8310560,8311360," So, I'm going to be back, so I'm going to be back."
8311360,8312260," So, I'm going to be back."
8312260,8312820," So, I'm going to be back, so I'm going to be back."
8312820,8321460," So, I'm going to be back."
8321460,8325280," So, I'm going to be back."
8325280,8327500," So, I'm going to be back."
8327500,8329720," So, I'm going to be back."

8335760,8337560," So, I'm going to be back."
8337560,8339580," So, I'm going to be back."
8339580,8341280," So, I'm going to be back."
8341280,8342420," So, I'm going to be back."
8342420,8344040," So, I'm going to be back."
8344040,8345340," So, I'm going to be back."
8345340,8346380," So, I'm going to be back."
8346380,8347640," So, I'm going to be back."
8347640,8348580," So, I'm going to be back."
8348580,8349920," So, I'm going to be back."
8349920,8350920," So, I'm going to be back."
8350920,8351880," So, I'm going to be back."
8351880,8352920," So, I'm going to be back."
8352920,8353420," So, I'm going to be back."
8353420,8354420," So, I'm going to be back."

8358420,8360420," So, I'm going to be back."
8360420,8362420," So, I'm going to be back."
8362420,8363420," So, I'm going to be back."
8369580,8371740," So, I'm going to be back."

8373240,8374380," So, I'm going to be back."
8374380,8375420," So, I'm going to be back."
8375420,8376380," So, I'm going to be back."
8376380,8377340," So, I'm going to be back."
8377340,8378380," So, I'm going to be back."
8378380,8379380," So, I'm going to be back."
8379380,8380380," So, I'm going to be back."
8380380,8382380," So, I'm going to be back."
8382380,8383380," So, I'm going to be back."
8383380,8384380," So, I'm going to be back."
8384380,8386380," So, I'm going to be back."
8386380,8387380," So, I'm going to be back."
8387380,8388380," So, I'm going to be back."
8388380,8389380," So, I'm going to be back."
8389380,8390380," So, I'm going to be back."
8390380,8392380," So, I'm going to be back."
8392380,8393380," So, I'm going to be back."
8393380,8394380," So, I'm going to be back."
8399580,8404380," But now, I need to have it slightly from here."
8404380,8411380," So, this is the chain."
8411380,8417380," So, the syntax is rather..."
8417380,8420380," I'm going to load it on every boot just for the memes."
8420380,8423380," Okay."
8423380,8425380," Sounds cool."
8425380,8437180," So, I will need to create a bunch of stuff that I don't really want to create."
8437180,8439180," But I'm kind of forced to create it anyway."
8439180,8443180," I still have to retain this pipe arg thing."
8443180,8451180," I still have to retain it just to be able to facilitate this thing."
8451180,8457980," But I might as well get rid of the make pipe arg."
8457980,8460980," Because literally what it does, it just accumulates..."
8460980,8462980," Yeah, it just accumulates these things."
8462980,8463980," Like this."
8463980,8464980," Okay."
8464980,8466980," So, let's actually start removing this."
8466980,8469980," Pipe arg."
8469980,8472980," No build."
8472980,8475980," Pipe."
8475980,8477980," Make pipe arg."
8477980,8480780," So, now it will start falling apart."
8480780,8488780," But what we're going to do now is essentially..."
8488780,8489780," Let me remove that."
8489780,8495780," So, it's going to be type pipe arg."
8495780,8497780," So, here's the type that we're trying to make."
8497780,8503780," Pipe arg type is going to be equal pipe arg in."
8503780,8508580," And the actual args are no build make..."
8508580,8512580," Not really, not make pipe arg."
8512580,8515580," But..."
8515580,8517580," Something sister, right?"
8517580,8518580," Um..."
8518580,8519580," Sister var..."
8519580,8520580," Yeah, yeah."
8520580,8521580," So, this one."
8521580,8524580," Where we take varied arguments."
8524580,8527580," We don't even need to do that, if you think about it."
8527580,8529580," Alright, we're going to put 69."
8529580,8531380," So, what is it?"
8531380,8532380," Okay."
8532380,8534380," It takes a thing that ignores it."
8534380,8535380," 69."
8535380,8543380," And then we do the args."
8543380,8544380," Oh, shit."
8544380,8546380," I have an interesting idea, actually."
8546380,8548380," What if this function..."
8548380,8549380," Oh, my God."
8549380,8552380," What if this function, instead of taking an ignore..."
8552380,8555180," will take a pointer to the count?"
8555180,8556180," Yeah."
8556180,8558180," It will take a pointer to the count."
8558180,8561180," And you can set it to null if you don't care about it."
8561180,8565180," But if you do care about it, it can provide you this information."
8565180,8566180," I think it's better."
8566180,8567180," Yeah."
8567180,8568180," Oh, shit."
8568180,8569180," That's a cool idea."
8569180,8570180," Oh, shit."
8570180,8571180," That's a cool idea."
8571180,8572180," Ganovina banana."
8572180,8573180," I hope I pronounced your nickname correctly."
8573180,8577180," Thank you so much for six months of tier one subscription."
8577180,8578180," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
8578180,8581180," And welcome to our epic variadic club."
8581180,8598980," Alright, thank you so much for the subscription."
8598980,8599980," Epic."
8599980,8601980," Absolutely epic."
8601980,8604980," Oh, shit."
8604980,8606980," Um..."
8606980,8629780," Alright, so let's try to do that."
8629780,8630780," Uh..."
8630780,8635580," Maybe I'm gonna first get rid of this entire thing, because I wanted to compile first."
8635580,8636580," Alright."
8636580,8637580," Uh..."
8637580,8638580," Um..."
8638580,8639580," Intervert."
8639580,8640580," Uh-huh."
8640580,8641580," So this is going to be the count."
8641580,8642580," Uh..."
8642580,8643580," And let me see."
8643580,8644580," So..."
8644580,8645580," Uh-huh."
8645580,8646580," This is going to be the count."
8646580,8647580," Uh-huh."
8647580,8648580," So this is going to be the count."
8648580,8649580," Uh-huh."
8649580,8650580," And let me see."
8650580,8651380," Uh-huh."
8651380,8652380," Uh-huh."
8652380,8653380," Uh-huh."
8653380,8654380," Uh-huh."
8654380,8655380," And let me see."
8655380,8656380," So..."
8656380,8657380," Uh-huh."
8657380,8658380," Uh-huh."
8658380,8659380," This is the count."
8659380,8660380," Actually..."
8660380,8661380," It's called out count."
8661380,8662380," Right?"
8662380,8664380," Because we already have an internal count."
8664380,8665380," And, uh..."
8665380,8669380," I'm going to return you a count only if you provided the count."
8669380,8670380," Right?"
8670380,8671380," Out count."
8671380,8674580," If it's available, it's going to be out count equal the count."
8674580,8679180," So you will have an access to the amount of elements there."
8679180,8680180," Um..."
8680180,8682180," So yeah, I think it's a pretty convenient function."
8682180,8686180," It kind of sucks that they have to do this kind of stuff at runtime."
8686180,8687180," Right?"
8687180,8688180," So it's just kind of..."
8688180,8689180," Really?"
8689180,8691180," Do I really have to do that at runtime?"
8691180,8693180," But I mean, it is what it is."
8693180,8694180," Uh..."
8694180,8696180," Okay."
8696180,8697180," Alright."
8697180,8699180," And now you can literally do it like that."
8699180,8702980," So we can put a null in here and it just makes more sense now."
8702980,8704980," Which is pretty pogue."
8704980,8706980," Not gonna lie."
8706980,8707980," Uh..."
8707980,8709980," So I might as well actually commit that."
8709980,8712980," I think it's a pretty good change."
8712980,8713980," Uh..."
8713980,8715980," Okay."
8715980,8717980," Uh-huh."
8717980,8720980," So make..."
8720980,8723980," NoBuildSisterOrgad return..."
8723980,8724980," Uh..."
8724980,8727980," The size of the array."
8727980,8728980," Right."
8728980,8730780," Return the size of the array."
8730780,8732780," And I might as well actually do it like that here."
8732780,8734780," I'm gonna push that."
8734780,8735780," Uh..."
8735780,8741780," C is really difficult to use for DSLs."
8741780,8744780," C++ is easier to use for DSLs."
8744780,8745780," Uh..."
8745780,8748780," But I don't know how much slower they are and up."
8748780,8749780," So..."
8749780,8750780," Yeah."
8750780,8752780," And this is what essentially I'm doing here."
8752780,8755380," I'm developing like a DSL on top of C."
8755380,8756580," Which is probably already a bad idea."
8756580,8757580," But..."
8757580,8761580," I don't know."
8761580,8764580," Maybe it would be better to get rid of the DSL completely."
8764580,8765580," Right?"
8765580,8766580," And leave only..."
8766580,8767580," This kind of syntax."
8767580,8769380," But it's kind of tedious."
8769380,8770380," Like really..."
8770380,8773380," Do you really have to do that just to organize a pipe?"
8773380,8774380," This is dumb."
8774380,8775380," Like I..."
8775380,8776380," If I..."
8776380,8779380," If I were using this build system, I wouldn't want to do that all the time."
8779380,8781380," I want to be able to just define this pipe like that."
8781380,8782380," And just forget about it."
8782380,8784380," It has to be like a throwaway thing."
8784380,8785380," So that's why..."
8785380,8786380," Uh..."
8786380,8787380," Yeah."
8787380,8790380," That's why I want to have like a macro stuff."
8790380,8791380," Even..."
8791380,8793180," Even if it's going to end up slower."
8793180,8794180," Uh..."
8794180,8795180," At least it's more convenient."
8795180,8798180," Because it's more about convenience."
8798180,8800180," That's why people make DSLs."
8800180,8801180," Yeah."
8801180,8802180," That's probably why."
8802180,8804180," But they..."
8804180,8805180," Then..."
8805180,8807180," The problem with that is that..."
8807180,8809180," Then they act like..."
8809180,8810180," Uh..."
8810180,8813180," There was no cost of making that DSL."
8813180,8821980," Okay."
8821980,8826980," Alright."
8826980,8828980," So now I want to do it like this."
8828980,8830980," So if I'm going to construct the pipe arg..."
8830980,8834980," I want to remove this into anything."
8834980,8839980," So..."
8839980,8840980," It's gone now."
8843180,8844980," Rust has zero-cost abstractions."
8844980,8845180," Sure."
8845180,8847980," What's funny is that..."
8847980,8850180," Zero-cost abstraction is not even a Rust meme."
8850180,8852980," Rust community didn't come up with that meme."
8852980,8853980," It's a C++ meme."
8853980,8855580," It's always been a C++ meme."
8855580,8857580," And the funny things..."
8857580,8860380," Like Rust people act like they invented this notion."
8860380,8861780," It's just so weird to me."
8861780,8864380," So..."
8864380,8866580," The first hook came up with that idea was..."
8866580,8867780," Straustrup himself."
8867780,8868480," Right?"
8868480,8871780," Because it was one of his principles when he was designing C++."
8872380,8873580," It's just so weird."
8873580,8874180," Also..."
8874180,8876180," If it compiles, it probably works."
8876180,8878180," It's also not a Rust meme."
8878180,8880180," It's a meme that comes from the Haskell community."
8880180,8882180," Which probably also stole it from somewhere."
8882180,8883180," It's just like..."
8883180,8887180," And in British..."
8887180,8888180," I don't know..."
8888180,8891180," Is the fearless concurrency also not a Rust meme?"
8891180,8892180," Yeah."
8892180,8894180," Rust is basically a repost."
8894180,8899180," Does anyone know the origin of the fearless concurrency meme?"
8899180,8901980," Was it actually originally made by Rust community?"
8901980,8903980," Considering all the other Rust memes..."
8903980,8905380," I kinda doubt that."
8905380,8907180," But who knows?"
8907180,8909980," Maybe they came up with some original meme by themselves."
8909980,8910380," Who knows?"
8920380,8921580," Fearless concurrency?"
8921580,8922580," Nah..."
8922580,8924780," The Erlang meme is ""Let it crash""."
8924780,8926180," So..."
8926180,8929180," I don't remember fearless concurrency in Erlang."
8929180,8930980," I mean, as a meme."
8930980,8931780," As a meme."
8931780,8934180," The meme from Erlang is ""Let it crash""."
8939380,8942180," I think fearless concurrency is actually a Rust original."
8942180,8942980," Oh, okay."
8942980,8945980," That's pretty cool."
8945980,8947180," Yeah."
8947180,8947780," I can see that."
8947780,8953980," Wasn't fearless first Tokyo?"
8953980,8956580," Oh, that means that it's an original Rust meme."
8956580,8957180," Sure."
8957180,8961780," Actual original Rust meme."
8962180,8962780," Naisu."
8962780,8963780," Naisu, naisu, naisu."
8963780,8965380," Okay."
8965380,8969980," Let it crash."
8969980,8971580," Let it crash."
8971580,8974780," Let it crash or let it crash."
8984980,8989980," And I'm proud that ""Let it leak"" is the Zodin community meme."
8989980,8990380," Yeah."
8990380,8991580," We came up with this meme."
8991580,8992380," Let it leak."
8992380,9001180," It's my favorite."
9001180,9003580," Who needs array AI?"
9003580,9005380," Who needs garbage collection?"
9005380,9007380," Just fucking let it leak."
9007380,9009380," Secfold is not..."
9009380,9009780," Yeah, yeah."
9009780,9012180," By the way, if you just let it leak, you're never gonna secfold."
9012180,9014180," Well, I mean, it depends on what you're doing."
9014180,9017180," Maybe, maybe you want to intentionally secfold in that case."
9017180,9020180," Not freeing anything is not going to help him."
9020180,9023580," Let it leak."
9023580,9025580," Let it leak."
9025580,9026980," Let it leak."
9026980,9028780," Or let it leak."
9028780,9034680," Memory costs nothing."
9034680,9036680," Let it leak."
9036680,9038580," I'm leaking."
9038580,9040080," Okay, sure."
9043080,9044480," Let it leak."
9044480,9046280," So, make a pipe."
9046280,9047680," And this is what we're going to do here."
9047680,9047880," So..."
9047880,9056280," No build."
9056280,9060280," No build sister of our orgs."
9060280,9062480," To music."
9062480,9064980," Come to Amazon."
9064980,9068380," No, I'm not going to change to music."
9068380,9068880," I'm sorry."
9072680,9073180," So..."
9073180,9073180," So..."
9073180,9073980," And then..."
9073980,9074680," It's going to be..."
9074680,9077180," Yeah, you just surround this thing with nulls and then we go."
9077180,9079680," Pipe."
9079680,9080180," Arg."
9080180,9082680," Pipe."
9082680,9083080," Arg."
9083080,9084880," Type."
9084880,9091280," The type has to be pipe."
9091280,9091780," Arg."
9091780,9093880," Pipe."
9093880,9094480," Arg."
9094480,9095280," In."
9096780,9097780," You sing so well, WTF."
9097780,9099080," You sing so well, WTF."
9099080,9101980," I mean, I have a musical education, by the way."
9101980,9107780," I don't really sing that well as I used to because I haven't practiced, but..."
9107780,9110080," Yeah."
9110080,9112080," Yes."
9112080,9116580," I'm something of a musician myself."
9116580,9117780," That's what I can say."
9117780,9122680," Fortunately, I never finished my musical education, but I know a couple of things."
9125280,9125780," Uh..."
9125780,9132780," No, it's true."
9132780,9135280," I guess."
9135280,9136280," I guess."
9136280,9141780," So, here's the in, and I need to do the similar thing for the out."
9141780,9144280," So, I need to do the similar thing for the out."
9144280,9146280," Uh-huh."
9146280,9146780," The out."
9146780,9147780," And for the chain."
9147780,9148780," For the chain, it's going to be..."
9150780,9151280," Oh, yeah."
9151280,9153280," So, this one has to be just path."
9153280,9157280," Has to be just path."
9157280,9159780," Can I make it a little bit more readable?"
9159780,9164280," I think I can try to make it more readable, but I'm not sure if it's going to be worth it."
9164280,9165780," It's going to be worth it."
9165780,9168780," Yeah, definitely not worth it."
9168780,9170780," I want to do this."
9170780,9171280," Look at that."
9171280,9172280," Look at that."
9172280,9173280," I think it's starting to work."
9173280,9173780," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
9173780,9174780," So, we can do it like that."
9174780,9175780," So, yeah."
9175780,9177780," You construct the pipe argument, and..."
9177780,9178780," Yeah, there we go."
9178780,9182780," When will you build the MIDI keyboard?"
9182780,9183780," It's a good question."
9183780,9184780," I don't know."
9184780,9188780," I need to buy a new MIDI keyboard."
9188780,9191780," Or you mean build, like, from scratch?"
9192280,9194280," I know nothing about, like, hardware and stuff."
9194280,9197780," So, I probably have to research how to do that first."
9197780,9203780," This is a little bit more readable, which is super nice."
9203780,9206780," Okay, I go."
9206780,9210780," So, chain is going to be similar."
9213280,9213780," ARG."
9213780,9216280," It's going to be like this."
9216280,9217780," And then just enclose it."
9217780,9219780," Tomorrow, yeah."
9219780,9221280," It's my favorite answer."
9221280,9225780," You know me so well, Jay."
9225780,9226780," Oh, my God."
9226780,9235280," ARGs."
9235280,9239780," Okay."
9239780,9241280," So, that looks good."
9243280,9252780," I forgot to properly do this thing."
9252780,9256280," It has to be like this, and then a null."
9256280,9258780," Doxed."
9258780,9259780," D-doxed."
9259780,9265780," It's a distributed doxed, right?"
9265780,9271780," So, if a D-dos is distributed denial of service, D-doxed, it's a distributed doxed."
9273280,9274280," D-doxed, right?"
9274280,9276780," All right."
9276780,9280780," So, we can construct a single thing in here."
9280780,9283780," And interestingly enough."
9286280,9289780," And now, do the pipe thing."
9289780,9290780," Okay."
9290780,9292780," So, to do the pipe thing, we still have to..."
9292780,9297780," Yeah, we still have to provide the thing that ignores everything."
9300780,9301280," I know war."
9301280,9302280," I know war."
9302280,9303280," You know war."
9303280,9307280," Uh, maybe we should be able to build a pipe."
9307280,9309280," Yeah."
9309280,9311280," We need a function that builds a pipe."
9311280,9313780," That's true."
9316280,9325280," So, no build pipe has to be a function that, given all of this garbage, returns you a new pipe that you can then use."
9325280,9326780," All right."
9326780,9328780," It builds it out of the pipe arguments."
9328780,9333780," Let me see."
9333780,9335780," So, it doesn't try to execute it or anything."
9335780,9337780," And by the way, it should be cross-platform."
9337780,9341280," Since it just builds the pipe, it's essentially a cross-platform thing."
9341780,9343280," It doesn't really matter that much."
9343280,9347280," Uh, CMD count."
9347280,9352780," Yeah, it's gonna be pipe."
9352780,9357280," It will just return you a new, fresh pipe."
9357280,9361780," All right."
9361780,9366780," So, uh, I think we can remove all of that now and just do a result."
9366780,9368780," Chat, I'm hungry."
9369780,9372280," Uh, you should just eat something, I suppose."
9372280,9374780," Uh, do you have any food at home?"
9374780,9380280," So, I would suggest to search for food first and maybe order something."
9380280,9386780," Um, I wonder if I can cross-compile the module for the RPI."
9386780,9388280," You should give it a try."
9388280,9389280," You see?"
9389280,9392780," I'm giving useful advices on this channel."
9393680,9394680," But I'm lazy to make food."
9394680,9398680," Uh, you can try to make a simple food."
9398680,9402180," Um, I don't know."
9402180,9406180," For example, something super simple is actually super quick."
9406180,9410180," Uh, today, like, at morning, I made a breakfast."
9410180,9415180," I just cooked a bowl of rice in the pot and it took me 20 minutes."
9415180,9421680," Um, I made a bowl of rice from scratch without any rice cooker or anything, um, in 20 minutes."
9421680,9423680," It was actually super, super quick."
9425680,9432180," Um, I made enough for a single bowl, though, without rice cooker."
9432180,9435180," Yeah, yeah, I did it in the pot, really."
9435180,9437180," Uh, it was super simple."
9437180,9443180," Like, I have a, uh, basically, I do that, uh, I use, like, a cup like this."
9443180,9446180," Uh, I, oh, you don't have rice at home."
9446180,9447180," Uh, okay."
9447180,9449680," Uh, so I have a, I use cup like this."
9449680,9455680," So, essentially, I know that this amount of rice, roughly, is for a single bowl, right?"
9455680,9461680," So, essentially, I would pour a rice, like, this amount of rice, into the cup, right?"
9461680,9465680," Then, inside of that cup, I would actually wash the rice."
9465680,9469920," It's actually quite important to wash your rice, uh, because there's a lot of, like, extra"
9469920,9475780," starch on, on the rice that, when cooked, makes your rice, like, very sticky and very mushy."
9475780,9477080," It's really not pleasant to eat."
9477080,9481180," So, just wanna wash away this extra, uh, extra starch."
9481180,9486920," Once I washed it away, since it's already in a cup, uh, I can pour enough water for the"
9486920,9487920," entire rice."
9487920,9492340," So, to cook a rice, you need one part of rice and two parts of water, right?"
9492340,9496980," In, in a cup, I actually have a transparent cup, which makes it, like, super easy to measure."
9496980,9502220," So, one, um, uh, one part of rice and two parts of water, right?"
9502220,9509100," Once it's all there, I just pour the contents of that cup into the pot, add salt, maybe butter"
9509100,9513100," and stuff like that, and it just, uh, bring it to the boil."
9513100,9519620," Once it starts to boil, uh, I actually turn off the stove and I wait until the water completely"
9519620,9524840," absorbed by the rice, since the amount of rice is so small, it's gonna be super quick, but"
9524840,9529320," you have to be very careful, because since the amount of rice is so small, it will start"
9529320,9531400," boiling very, very quickly."
9531400,9532560," It also depends on your stove."
9532560,9537940," I actually have a pretty powerful Soviet stove, uh, that, uh, yeah, it's, it starts boiling,"
9537940,9542260," like, within, like, five minutes and the rest of the 15 minutes, it keeps absorbing the,"
9542260,9545480," uh, the moisture, uh, and yeah."
9545480,9551960," So, this is the way I, you know, cooked the rice, uh, in, within 20 minutes."
9551960,9557540," But again, you have to be really careful, like, uh, if you cook this small amount of rice just"
9557540,9562700," for one portion, you have to constantly, uh, like, monitor it, right?"
9562700,9565760," Like that, because it will start boiling pretty much immediately, because you don't really"
9565760,9570440," have that much water, so it's, you know, yeah."
9570440,9574600," So this is how I do that, and it's actually super, once you get used to making rice like"
9574600,9575920," that, it's super quick."
9575920,9583420," Uh, yeah, I don't know, so I'm just sharing my experience, my life experience."
9583420,9586780," I'm not sure how useful it is for anyone, but yeah."
9586780,9591500," We need a cooking stream, I don't know, we'll see."
9591500,9599380," Also in Russia, uh, we have a competing product to rice, which is buckwheat, and I suppose a"
9599380,9604500," lot of Slav knows what I'm talking about, right, uh, buckwheat."
9604500,9609500," Along with the rice, we also, uh, eat this thing, which is also like a cereal thingy, and"
9609500,9613740," it's cooked in a very similar way."
9613740,9619280," And the ratio of water and the buckwheat is pretty much the same, uh, the only difference"
9619280,9627040," is that they absorb, um, water slightly differently, and they first, they cook at different times,"
9627040,9628800," and they absorb differently."
9628800,9633080," So essentially, uh, if you cook in the rice, and you see, uh, on the surface of the rice,"
9633080,9640040," rice, there is no water, right, so quite likely, there is no water underneath, as well."
9640040,9641980," With the buckwheat, it's not the same."
9641980,9646700," If you don't see any water on the surface of a buckwheat, right, there's probably a little"
9646700,9649200," bit of water, uh, like, at the bottom there."
9649200,9653120," So it's, it's kind of like, it absorbs the water slightly differently than, than the rice."
9653120,9655860," So you have to keep these kind of differences in mind."
9655860,9660080," So in case of rice, you can rely on the look of the surface, in case of the buckwheat, you"
9660080,9661080," cannot rely on that."
9661080,9664080," Apart from that, they, they are cooked pretty much the same."
9664080,9671040," Um, yeah."
9671040,9673040," Okay."
9673040,9676980," Uh, so yeah, it is, it is really popular."
9676980,9680040," I would say that in Russia, it's more popular than rice."
9680040,9681040," Um, yeah."
9681040,9682040," Yeah."
9682040,9683040," Eh."
9683040,9687840," To be fair, I, I, I like the taste of the rice more than the taste of the buckwheat."
9687840,9691040," Buckwheat has a very specific taste, but it's really bland."
9691040,9697120," It's like, uh, yeah, but it's, I mean, it's eatable, it's, it's eatable, and it's actually"
9697120,9698380," pretty cheap as well."
9698380,9699380," Mm."
9699380,9700380," Okay."
9700380,9705980," Um, all right, you managed to cross-compile it."
9705980,9706980," Nice."
9706980,9707980," Nice."
9707980,9708980," Congratulations."
9708980,9709940," That's actually pretty cool."
9709940,9715980," All righty, all righty."
9715980,9716980," Mm."
9716980,9717980," Mm."
9717980,9718980," Mm."
9718980,9719980," Mm."
9719980,9720980," Mm."
9720980,9721980," Mm."
9721980,9722980," Mm."
9722980,9723980," What else?"
9723980,9724980," What else?"
9724980,9725980," Mm."
9725980,9726980," Mm."
9726980,9727980," Mm."
9727980,9728980," Mm."
9728980,9729980," Mm."
9729980,9730980," Mm."
9730980,9731980," Mm."
9731980,9732980," Mm."
9732980,9733980," Mm."
9733980,9734980," Mm."
9734980,9735980," Mm."
9735980,9736980," Mm."
9736980,9737980," So what are we doing?"
9737980,9738980," We're building the pipe, right?"
9738980,9740980," So we're building the pipe."
9740980,9744980," Uh, so result is initially going to be this."
9744980,9746980," So a pipa."
9746980,9747980," Pipa."
9747980,9750920," Oh, we need to build the chain first."
9750920,9751920," as well."
9751920,9753920," So this one is going to be interesting."
9753920,9755920," So that means we'll have to do the chain thing."
9755920,9756920," It's good."
9756920,9758920," Like, count the size of the chain first."
9758920,9759920," Um."
9763920,9768920," You're in the fight is between the rice versus pasta."
9768920,9769920," Mm."
9769920,9770920," Okay."
9770920,9773920," Uh, okay."
9773920,9774920," Good."
9774920,9777920," So this is the input file path and essentially, you know what?"
9777920,9780920," I think I'm going to try to compile that and go through the compilation errors."
9780920,9781920," Okay."
9781920,9785920," So this is going to be the result and we're setting the results."
9785920,9786920," Cool."
9786920,9788920," Results."
9788920,9790920," Results."
9790920,9791920," Do we have anything else?"
9791920,9792920," Do we have anything else?"
9792920,9793920," Aha."
9793920,9794920," Results."
9794920,9795920," Chain."
9795920,9796920," I think it's chain size."
9796920,9797920," It's a chain size."
9797920,9798920," Uh, and chain size."
9798920,9799920," Uh, and chain size."
9799920,9810920," Uh, I think we don't need to check that anymore here because it's going to be the job of the"
9810920,9811920," interpreter of the pipe."
9811920,9817920," Then, um, pasta, rice, any day."
9817920,9818920," Yeah, I guess so."
9818920,9821920," I kind of like pasta better than rice."
9821920,9828920," Uh, to be fair, I never tried, uh, fried rice, uh, fried rice, and I heard like a lot of good things about it."
9828920,9830920," So maybe I'm going to like it better."
9830920,9832920," Um, anyway."
9832920,9835920," Um."
9835920,9848920," So it's going to be a result chain and I just allocate."
9848920,9849920," Okay."
9849920,9852920," This one is interesting."
9852920,9856920," We want to allocate CMDs rather than the arguments, right?"
9856920,9858920," That's what we want to allocate here."
9858920,9860920," Fried rice is good."
9860920,9861920," Okay."
9864920,9866920," You've never tried fried rice?"
9866920,9867920," No."
9867920,9868920," Never tried it."
9868920,9872920," Primarily because I don't really go anywhere and don't order any food."
9872920,9874920," I usually cook everything myself."
9874920,9875920," Um."
9875920,9878920," There's no particular, like, reason for that."
9878920,9883920," I think there is, like, several reasons why I do that."
9883920,9884920," Um."
9884920,9887920," First of all, I'm very, very asocial, right?"
9887920,9888920," So."
9888920,9893920," It's just easier for me to cook everything myself without, like, going anywhere or ordering anything."
9893920,9894920," Uh."
9894920,9896920," Which is kind of interesting."
9896920,9901920," Ordering anything still involves, like, you know, social activities."
9901920,9903920," So for me, it's kind of, eh."
9903920,9904920," Uh."
9904920,9905920," And another thing."
9905920,9906920," I was born in a pretty poor family."
9906920,9909920," So I grew up very, uh, fragile."
9909920,9910920," Um."
9910920,9911920," And, uh."
9911920,9913920," Got used to the habit of cooking everything myself."
9913920,9916920," Even though right now I don't really need to cook anything myself."
9916920,9918920," But it's still, it's just a force of a habit."
9918920,9919920," And I cannot get rid of it."
9919920,9920920," Um."
9920920,9921920," Yeah."
9921920,9924920," Because if you cook yourself, it's usually way cheaper."
9924920,9927920," It's, like, way cheaper when you cook everything yourself."
9927920,9928920," Um."
9928920,9929920," Um."
9929920,9934920," You go to the store, interact with Chloe there."
9934920,9935920," It's not the same."
9935920,9936920," Uh."
9936920,9937920," It's not the same."
9937920,9942920," First of all, it happens a way more rare because I just buy enough food for several days."
9942920,9946920," And, second of all, I don't have to really talk to them."
9946920,9949920," I can just bring the food and just pay for it."
9949920,9950920," And that's it."
9950920,9951920," Uh."
9951920,9956920," What's your favorite go-to meal?"
9956920,9959920," I don't really have a favorite go-to meal."
9959920,9963920," To be fair, I kind of got rid of the recreational aspect of the food recently."
9963920,9966920," So I just eat for sustenance."
9966920,9967920," All right."
9967920,9969920," So, uh."
9969920,9970920," Uh."
9970920,9971920," Okay."
9971920,9972920," Um."
9972920,9973920," Chain count."
9973920,9976920," So this is what we need to allocate."
9976920,9977920," Um."
9977920,9990920," So the reason why I did that is because I'm very compulsive eater."
9990920,9991920," So."
9991920,9992920," Um."
9992920,9999900," And essentially, if there is a recreational aspect of the food for me, I get fat really"
9999900,10001900," working easily very fucking quick."
10001900,10007900," So essentially, for me to get rid of that is to basically say to myself, food is not a recreational"
10007900,10008900," activity."
10008900,10009900," Just right."
10009900,10012900," If you want something for entertainment, just do something else."
10012900,10013900," Um."
10013900,10014900," So."
10014900,10015900," Yeah."
10015900,10017900," It's really difficult to explain, but."
10017900,10018900," Uh."
10018900,10019900," It kind of works for me."
10019900,10020900," It kind of works for me."
10020900,10021900," Um."
10021900,10022900," Um."
10022900,10023900," All right."
10023900,10027900," So I'm going to reset this entire pointer."
10027900,10028900," Uh."
10028900,10029900," So far it works."
10029900,10030900," Uh."
10030900,10031900," Maybe at some point I."
10031900,10032900," It won't work anymore."
10032900,10033900," And instead become a compulsive eater yet again."
10033900,10034900," But."
10034900,10035900," Uh."
10035900,10036900," I don't know."
10036900,10050900," As long as I don't eat anything super tasty, I don't want to use food as a recreational"
10050900,10051900," activity."
10051900,10052900," So."
10052900,10056900," It sounds horrible, but I mean, it's just, that's how my brain works."
10056900,10057900," I can't help it."
10057900,10058900," Uh."
10058900,10059900," Okay."
10059900,10060900," So we implemented that."
10060900,10061900," Why are we talking about that?"
10061900,10062900," It makes me sad."
10062900,10063900," Uh."
10063900,10064900," Mm."
10064900,10065900," Mm."
10065900,10066900," Mm."
10066900,10067900," Mm."
10067900,10068900," Mm."
10068900,10069900," Mm."
10069900,10070900," Mm."
10070900,10071900," Mm."
10071900,10072900," Mm."
10072900,10073900," Mm."
10073900,10074900," So."
10074900,10075900," Yeah."
10075900,10076900," Size."
10076900,10077900," And then."
10077900,10080900," We are iterated the entire thing."
10080900,10082900," And if this is the argument chain."
10082900,10083900," Uh."
10083900,10085900," I just use this."
10085900,10086900," Um."
10086900,10087900," Mm."
10087900,10088900," Mm."
10088900,10089900," Mm."
10089900,10090900," Mm."
10090900,10091900," Mm."
10091900,10092900," Mm."
10092900,10093900," Mm."
10093900,10094900," Mm."
10094900,10095900," Mm."
10095900,10096900," Mm."
10096900,10097900," Mm."
10097900,10098900," Size."
10098900,10099900," And, uh."
10099900,10100900," Essentially for the chain."
10100900,10101900," I just specify."
10101900,10102900," Args."
10102900,10103900," Arg."
10103900,10104900," Arg."
10104900,10105900," Arg."
10105900,10106900," Arg."
10106900,10108900," I guess that's what I do."
10108900,10112900," I just transfer this thing from one place to another one."
10112900,10113900," Mm."
10113900,10114900," Mm."
10114900,10120900," Most of the impact and the weight is done not in the gym, but in the supermarket."
10120900,10121900," The gym, but in the supermarket."
10121900,10122900," Yeah."
10122900,10123900," That is true."
10123900,10124900," Mm."
10124900,10125900," Mm."
10125900,10126900," Cool."
10126900,10127900," Mm."
10127900,10128900," Mm."
10128900,10129900," Mm."
10129900,10130900," Mm."
10130900,10131900," Mm."
10131900,10131900," Mm."
10131900,10132900," Mm."
10132900,10133900," Mm."
10133900,10134900," Mm."
10134900,10135900," Mm."
10135900,10136900," Mm."
10136900,10137900," Mm."
10137900,10138900," All right."
10138900,10139900," I think."
10139900,10141900," I think I managed to build this."
10141900,10142900," And I think so."
10142900,10143900," We're building a pipe."
10143900,10145900," The pipe has been built successfully."
10145900,10146900," Uh."
10146900,10147900," What's up?"
10147900,10148900," Call me CF."
10148900,10149900," Uh."
10149900,10150900," Welcome to the stream."
10150900,10151900," How are you doing?"
10151900,10152900," How are you doing?"
10152900,10153900," Uh."
10153900,10154900," Assetment of member orgs is in read-only object."
10154900,10155900," Oh, shit."
10155900,10156900," Why is this a read-only object?"
10156900,10157900," Ah."
10157900,10158900," I see."
10158900,10159900," I see."
10159900,10160900," I see."
10160900,10161900," I see."
10161900,10162900," So it shouldn't be read-only then."
10162900,10163900," Mm."
10163900,10164900," Mm."
10164900,10165900," Mm."
10165900,10166900," Mm."
10166900,10167900," Yeah."
10167900,10168900," We have to do something like this."
10168900,10169900," Mm."
10169900,10170900," Mm."
10170900,10171900," Mm."
10171900,10172900," Mm."
10172900,10173900," Mm."
10173900,10174900," Mm."
10174900,10175900," Mm."
10175900,10176900," Mm."
10176900,10177900," Mm."
10177900,10178900," Mm."
10178900,10179900," Mm."
10179900,10180900," Mm."
10180900,10181900," Yeah."
10181900,10183900," We have to do something like this."
10183900,10184900," Mm."
10184900,10186900," Mm."
10186900,10187900," Mm."
10187900,10188900," Mm."
10188900,10189900," Mm."
10189900,10190900," Mm."
10190900,10191900," Mm."
10191900,10192900," Okay."
10192900,10193900," Something."
10193900,10194900," All right."
10194900,10197900," And so we have this entire thing and we have to return the pipe."
10197900,10200900," So we are returning the pipe."
10200900,10203900," The return of the pipe."
10203900,10204900," Cool."
10204900,10209900," So and I think this entire thing should be called like make pipe."
10209900,10210900," Uh."
10210900,10212900," So we already have no build."
10212900,10213900," Make."
10213900,10214900," Create."
10214900,10215900," Uh."
10215900,10217900," Spawn CMD."
10217900,10218900," Uh."
10218900,10219900," Spawn pipe."
10219900,10220900," All right."
10220900,10224900," So let's rename it to build the pipe."
10224900,10225900," Mm."
10225900,10226900," Mm."
10226900,10227900," No build."
10227900,10228900," No build."
10228900,10229900," No build."
10229900,10230900," Make."
10230900,10231900," Uh."
10231900,10232900," Make pipe."
10232900,10233900," All right."
10233900,10234900," So like this."
10234900,10235900," And after that."
10235900,10236900," Once you make a pipe."
10236900,10237900," And here by the way we don't really need to do it like this."
10237900,10238900," Uh."
10238900,10240900," And we can have something like end."
10240900,10241900," Which is essentially."
10241900,10242900," Uh."
10242900,10243900," Pipe."
10243900,10244900," Pipe."
10244900,10245900," Arg."
10245900,10246900," Uh."
10246900,10247900," Mm."
10247900,10248900," Mm."
10248900,10249900," Mm."
10249900,10250900," Mm."
10250900,10251900," Mm."
10251900,10252900," Mm."
10252900,10253900," So type."
10253900,10254900," Pipe."
10254900,10255900," Arg."
10255900,10256900," End."
10256900,10257900," Cool."
10257900,10258900," So we can put it like that."
10258900,10259900," Don't worry about it."
10259900,10260900," So make a pipe."
10260900,10261900," Uh."
10261900,10262900," End."
10262900,10263900," So once you've got a pipe."
10263900,10266900," You should be able to spawn a pipe."
10266900,10267900," But when you have a pipe."
10267900,10268900," Uh."
10268900,10269900," You should be able to spawn a pipe."
10269900,10270900," But when you have a pipe."
10270900,10271900," You should be able to spawn a pipe."
10271900,10272900," You should be able to spawn a pipe."
10272900,10273900," But when you have a pipe."
10273900,10274900," You should be able to spawn a pipe."
10274900,10275900," You should be able to spawn a pipe."
10275900,10276900," You should be able to spawn a pipe."
10276900,10277900," I should be able to spawn a pipe."
10277900,10278900," Um."
10278900,10279900," Uh."
10279900,10280900," Um."
10280900,10281900," Um."
10281900,10282900," Yeah."
10282900,10283900," Um."
10283900,10284900," Uh."
10284900,10285900," Uh."
10285900,10286900," End."
10286900,10288900," So once you've got a pipe."
10288900,10291900," You should be able to spawn a pipe."
10291900,10293900," But once we're spawning."
10293900,10294900," Once we're spawning a pipe."
10294900,10296900," We need to wait for everything."
10296900,10297900," There."
10297900,10298900," Right."
10298900,10300900," So we need to wait for everything."
10300900,10302900," So maybe I'm gonna make it a macro as well."
10302900,10303900," Here."
10303900,10304900," Um."
10304900,10305900," Um."
10305900,10306900," Pid t."
10306900,10307900," Cpids."
10307900,10308900," Mm-hmm."
10308900,10309900," So it's gonna be like this."
10309900,10310900," Size t."
10310900,10311900," Uh huh."
10311900,10312900," Less than."
10312900,10313900," Oh shit."
10313900,10314900," Okay."
10314900,10315900," So that thing creates a pipe."
10315900,10316900," Right."
10316900,10317900," That thing creates a pipe."
10317900,10318900," Right."
10318900,10319900," That thing creates a pipe."
10319900,10321900," Which then have to."
10321900,10322900," To be fair."
10322900,10322900," I don't quite understand why."
10322900,10323900," Uh."
10323900,10324900," Spawn a pipe doesn't wait for everything."
10324900,10325900," It doesn't really make much sense in my opinion."
10325900,10326900," So."
10326900,10327900," Uh."
10327900,10337560," creates a pipe right that thing creates a pipe which you then have to to be fair i don't quite"
10337560,10344700," understand why uh spawn a pipe doesn't wait for everything it doesn't really make much sense in"
10344700,10351380," my opinion so uh i think it should wait for everything as well uh implicit declaration did"
10351380,10362540," you mean no did they fuck up something what is going on what did i fuck up what did they fuck up"
10362540,10369860," why is deer is implicit all of a sudden here did they remove something x please don't tell me i"
10369860,10375940," removed something accidentally please don't how did they remove all of that did they press"
10375940,10386700," oh my god i hate emacs i hate emacs i hate emacs oh it's so bad emacs is such a piece of shit holy"
10386700,10396260," shit you just press ctrl w once and just like and you don't notice it it's so bad oh my god"
10396260,10403180," luckily i'm using you know version control systems so i can just do something like this"
10403180,10415000," okay what the fuck do you want from oh my god i'm so disappointed i'm so oh my god"
10415000,10421500," uh you know what uh bye bye i don't want to know you"
10421500,10428040," he's been trying to annoy me like the whole stream i was"
10428040,10435200," all right"
10435200,10458020," all right so everything seems to be compiling everything seems to be compiling and i'm"
10458020,10467680," uh very happy with that i suppose so let me move the relevant information to the relevant"
10467680,10471680," places so this is the in and out"
10471680,10483340," okay okay"
10483340,10496460," and i don't remember what it was doing i don't remember what it was doing"
10496460,10510840," uh yeah okay i wanted to make the spawn pipe thing right spawn pipe to wait for all of the pits and whatnot"
10510840,10523620," uh which is interesting is it even worth doing that maybe it is worth doing that uh for now it is what we want to do anyway so it makes sense to do that then"
10523620,10530280," so and then i'm gonna just return this kind of thing"
10530280,10536940," uh"
10536940,10536940," uh"
10560280,10560980," and we don't have to do that"
10560980,10567940," and we don't have to do that anymore"
10567940,10570940," okay"
10570940,10571940," okay"
10571940,10581600," cool"
10581600,10582600," uh"
10582600,10582600," uh"
10582600,10585600," so spawning the pipe works now so if i do define pipe"
10585600,10596260," all right"
10596260,10597260," so i have to define it like that"
10597260,10600720," no build"
10600720,10601920," no build make pipe"
10601920,10603080," no build make pipe"
10603080,10604920," uh"
10604920,10610220," va args and also null so that creates a new pipe"
10610220,10615600," oh and since uh we don't have to wait for anything i can just do no build"
10615600,10619340," uh spawn a pipe"
10619340,10620840," right"
10620840,10622680," right i can just provide this pipe there"
10622680,10625000," but i have to provide it by a pointer"
10625000,10627340," is it does it make any sense to provide by the pointer"
10627340,10628680," i don't think so"
10628680,10630040," uh because"
10630040,10632500," yeah it doesn't have to be like that"
10632500,10633720," we can just provide it by our own"
10633720,10638460," this will make the entire thing a little bit easier to handle in my p"
10638460,10639640," right"
10639640,10641800," so you first make a pipe"
10641800,10642520," like this"
10642520,10644100," and then you can spawn a pipe"
10644100,10644740," and there you go"
10644740,10646540," that should give you everything you want"
10646540,10650340," that should give you everything you want"
10650340,10650780," uh"
10650780,10653940," so this thing will be handled by a value"
10653940,10655360," and now i have to replace"
10655360,10656940," my pipe"
10656940,10658680," um"
10658680,10662280," with my pipe"
10662280,10663200," dot"
10663200,10665780," everything here"
10665780,10670440," okay"
10670440,10672360," cool"
10672360,10673360," so what do we have here"
10673360,10673920," um"
10673920,10675040," spawn the pipe"
10675040,10676240," we don't have to do that"
10676240,10678100," cool"
10678100,10679100," so"
10679100,10680380," does it still work"
10680380,10681060," does it still work"
10681060,10681740," i don't think"
10681740,10683960," uh"
10683960,10686300," it doesn't work"
10686300,10686700," it doesn't"
10686700,10688080," oh because we're out there"
10688080,10688440," all right"
10688440,10689300," okay okay"
10689300,10692060," i think the time has come to test this entire thing out"
10692060,10693680," i think the time has come"
10693680,10698360," so i'm gonna comment this thing out"
10698360,10702740," and i'm gonna start by uh creating a pipe"
10702740,10704260," so it's gonna be chain"
10704260,10706620," uh sec"
10706620,10709500," 10"
10709500,10711620," and in no build"
10711620,10715080," in no build"
10715080,10720280," we're gonna only check"
10720280,10721240," example"
10721240,10722680," pipe"
10722680,10723300," dot c"
10723300,10725900," all right"
10725900,10726920," so as you can see"
10726920,10728160," this example worked"
10728160,10729400," as expected"
10729400,10731460," cool"
10731460,10733840," so that worked"
10733840,10734560," now"
10734560,10736720," i can try to do the following thing"
10736720,10737340," chain"
10737340,10739560," um"
10739560,10740700," sort"
10740700,10742720," but in reversed order"
10742720,10744740," and it worked"
10744740,10745340," so it's"
10745340,10746120," it's"
10746120,10747100," so that in reversed order"
10747100,10749620," so let's actually have a little bit more stuff here"
10749620,10750260," so let's"
10750260,10752000," do a sequence from thousand to"
10752000,10752720," uh"
10752720,10755040," thousand and ten"
10755040,10755580," so"
10755580,10757080," we have some stuff in here"
10757080,10757400," okay"
10757400,10758460," so that seems to be working"
10758460,10759560," so"
10759560,10760420," chain"
10760420,10762000," uh"
10762000,10762480," reverse"
10762480,10765540," so that will reverse each individual line in here"
10765540,10766600," uh"
10766600,10767420," right"
10767420,10769340," so that will reverse each individual line"
10769340,10770640," so it did in fact"
10770640,10771440," so"
10771440,10773640," and then we probably wanna uh"
10773640,10775360," do a base 64"
10775360,10775940," right"
10775940,10776780," base 64"
10776780,10778100," uh"
10778100,10778380," cool"
10778380,10780040," and that encodited in base 64"
10780040,10782720," then i'm gonna do a chain"
10782720,10784000," um"
10784000,10786000," gzip"
10786000,10786680," uh"
10786680,10787420," minus f"
10787420,10788980," to print it on the standard output"
10788980,10790120," so there we go"
10790120,10791000," it's in the standard output"
10791000,10791800," but it's not readable"
10791800,10793340," so that means we'll have to"
10793340,10794680," uh"
10794680,10795680," chain"
10795680,10797440," x dump"
10797440,10799940," minus c"
10799940,10800860," so"
10800860,10801900," and now it's more readable"
10801900,10803900," and i don't really want that on the screen"
10803900,10806900," so i'm gonna output that to output txt file"
10806900,10808380," all right"
10808380,10810400," and if i take a look at the txt here it is"
10810400,10810800," so"
10810800,10811800," um"
10811800,10812560," that's pretty cool"
10812560,10815780," so now i don't wanna do this entire thing"
10815780,10817240," on a sequence"
10817240,10818020," uh"
10818020,10819480," i wanna do this entire thing"
10819480,10820500," from the input"
10820500,10821080," uh"
10821080,10821660," of the file"
10821660,10823880," so it's gonna be something like example"
10823880,10825980," actually it has to be cross-platform"
10825980,10826480," it's gonna be"
10826480,10826860," uh"
10826860,10827280," path"
10827280,10828620," uh"
10828620,10829260," example"
10829260,10830140," uh"
10830140,10830900," pi.c"
10830900,10831940," and"
10831940,10832660," uh"
10832660,10833100," yeah"
10833100,10835060," i wanna do it like that"
10835060,10837440," so"
10837440,10839820," let's actually try to do it like this"
10839820,10840460," i wonder"
10840460,10842540," uh"
10842540,10843560," yeah"
10843560,10846000," i just wanna put that into the cut"
10846000,10847240," cat i mean"
10847240,10848820," just to see if it's gonna work"
10848820,10849940," so i'm gonna do it in the cat"
10849940,10850760," and"
10850760,10851840," couldn't read file"
10851840,10853300," example pipe.c"
10853300,10854180," because it doesn't exist"
10854180,10855340," it has to be examples"
10855340,10856780," okay"
10856780,10858100," so here's the entire file"
10858100,10858640," nice"
10858640,10859460," uh"
10859460,10862080," then i'm gonna sort each individual line"
10862080,10863480," and it didn't work"
10863480,10863960," because"
10863960,10865200," hawaii"
10865200,10866000," uh"
10866000,10869560," expression"
10869560,10872960," oh yeah"
10872960,10873800," all right i see"
10873800,10875020," cool"
10875020,10877700," so we sorted the lines"
10877700,10878360," in here"
10878360,10879460," uh"
10879460,10880240," right"
10880240,10881000," so it's gonna be"
10881000,10883120," then we reverse each individual line here"
10883120,10884060," uh"
10884060,10884820," then we base"
10884820,10886180," 64 the entire thing"
10886180,10887820," okay"
10887820,10888860," uh"
10888860,10890840," then we gzip the entire thing"
10890840,10893900," all right"
10893900,10895680," and then we hex dump"
10895680,10896880," the entire thing"
10896880,10900460," okay"
10900460,10901000," and then"
10901000,10903460," we save this entire thing"
10903460,10904220," into the"
10904220,10905000," uh"
10905000,10905940," output txt"
10905940,10907880," all right"
10907880,10909720," so in the output txt"
10909720,10910700," does contain"
10910700,10911580," the entire thing"
10911580,10912760," so"
10912760,10913560," yeah"
10913560,10914280," there we go"
10914280,10916480," it's pretty cool"
10916480,10919800," and all that doesn't call external shell"
10919800,10920520," that's the point"
10920520,10921880," it doesn't call the external shell"
10921880,10926880," so that's pretty interesting"
10926880,10930720," and it only works on linux right now"
10930720,10931840," so"
10931840,10932740," um"
10932740,10933360," we'll see"
10933360,10936180," how to make it work"
10936180,10937360," somewhere else"
10937360,10938080," uh"
10938080,10938800," pretty pogue"
10938800,10940200," yeah it is actually pretty pogue"
10940200,10941180," so unfortunately"
10941180,10942140," you can use this"
10942140,10942860," as an example"
10942860,10944000," on windows as well"
10944000,10945600," but the the problem is that"
10945600,10946900," these kind of things are not available"
10946900,10947600," on windows"
10947600,10948440," right"
10948440,10949480," so what i'm thinking is that"
10949480,10950440," maybe we're gonna have like"
10950440,10951580," some sort of a tool chain"
10951580,10953760," uh"
10953760,10954920," that implements"
10954920,10956260," some of these tools"
10956260,10957460," right"
10957460,10958380," so we can"
10958380,10958960," uh"
10958960,10960000," and no build"
10960000,10960960," will build"
10960960,10961880," these tools"
10961880,10963600," on all of the platforms"
10963600,10965240," and then use these tools"
10965240,10967040," to test piping activity"
10967040,10967840," you know what i mean"
10967840,10969400," so that would be actually pretty cool"
10969400,10970780," so something like sort"
10970780,10972440," and rev base 64"
10972440,10973680," are kind of easy to implement"
10973680,10976360," so that would be actually pretty cool"
10976360,10979780," but apart from that"
10979780,10980280," i mean yeah"
10980280,10981500," we managed to do that"
10981500,10982380," we managed to implement this"
10982380,10982840," entire thing"
10982840,10985400," so the internal implementation is shit"
10985400,10986580," uh"
10986580,10989860," but at least the interface is cool"
10989860,10992500," at least the interface is cool"
10992500,10996420," so and how do we put"
10996420,11003580," i think you're missing one directive"
11003580,11004880," cha out"
11004880,11009420," you got me"
11009420,11011480," cha in"
11011480,11012160," cha out"
11012160,11014440," well it's actually"
11014440,11019160," i'll think about it"
11019160,11020520," maybe we can have a use for that"
11020520,11022960," because we don't support redirecting"
11022960,11023980," the standard error"
11023980,11024600," right"
11024600,11025880," standard error thing"
11025880,11027200," and the question is"
11027200,11027900," how can we"
11027900,11029180," even support that"
11029180,11029660," right"
11029660,11032620," so we could try to do something like this"
11032620,11033660," right"
11033660,11034100," error"
11034100,11035020," error txt"
11035020,11036520," but what's interesting is that"
11036520,11038460," you should be able to redirect"
11038460,11040200," each individual chain"
11040200,11041120," uh"
11041120,11041720," separately"
11041720,11043380," right"
11043380,11043780," so"
11043780,11045920," redirecting each individual chains"
11045920,11047400," standard error should be"
11047400,11049160," probably look like this"
11049160,11049880," like"
11049880,11051980," sort error"
11051980,11054460," right"
11054460,11056700," sort error"
11056700,11058640," rev error"
11058640,11061980," maybe"
11061980,11063260," base64"
11063260,11067380," ms don't have pipes yet"
11067380,11068100," uh"
11068100,11069660," how did you come to that conclusion"
11069660,11070460," conclusion"
11070460,11075360," have you seen this thing"
11075360,11078420," so i mean"
11078420,11081300," i don't know"
11081300,11082580," 2018"
11082580,11083600," uh"
11083600,11085260," when was this function introduced actually"
11085260,11087600," i think it was"
11087600,11089000," there for a while"
11089000,11090100," it's pretty old functionality"
11090100,11090880," um"
11090880,11093380," yeah"
11093380,11094020," so"
11094020,11094820," technically"
11094820,11096960," it should be possible to do this kind of thing"
11096960,11097300," right"
11097300,11097620," so"
11097620,11099600," it's not that difficult for me"
11099600,11101120," for each individual chain"
11101120,11103620," to redirect their standard error"
11103620,11104200," um"
11104200,11106360," uh"
11106360,11107000," windows 2000"
11107000,11107340," okay"
11107340,11108160," so i mean"
11108160,11108900," yeah"
11108900,11110080," uh"
11110080,11111580," pipes are so useful"
11111580,11112980," that even windows have them"
11112980,11113660," so"
11113660,11114580," uh"
11114580,11117320," but then"
11117320,11118580," uh"
11118580,11121580," then"
11121580,11124400," why can't you do a similar thing"
11124400,11124980," without"
11124980,11125940," or within"
11125940,11128940," so"
11128940,11130160," yeah"
11130160,11130660," it's"
11130660,11132080," i'll need to think how we can"
11132080,11133800," do the error redirection"
11133800,11135180," so because it's not really obvious"
11135180,11136260," uh"
11136260,11137820," from the syntactical point of view"
11137820,11138840," and also"
11138840,11140400," we implement this thing"
11140400,11141360," the way"
11141360,11142720," that if you put this"
11142720,11143320," like that"
11143320,11144280," it will still work"
11144280,11144700," as"
11144700,11145540," uh"
11145540,11146120," as usual"
11146120,11148340," so it will be redirected to this one"
11148340,11149400," uh"
11149400,11149880," right"
11149880,11151500," so it will be redirected to this one"
11151500,11154260," so we don't really check"
11154260,11155620," uh"
11155620,11157360," at runtime"
11157360,11159980," if these things are located in correct positions"
11159980,11161220," maybe we should actually"
11161220,11162780," maybe we should"
11162780,11165720," it would be kind of cool to have this like small little dsl"
11165720,11167300," that will let you like you know"
11167300,11169640," do some interesting things with these chains"
11169640,11171380," but this is like a you know draft"
11171380,11173120," uh"
11173120,11173120," uh"
11173120,11174200," a simple draft"
11174200,11176240," anyway"
11176240,11178200," and that actually did the"
11178200,11179480," the trick"
11179480,11181940," so that created output"
11181940,11183200," dot txt"
11183200,11186000," so that's pretty pogue"
11186000,11187180," not gonna lie"
11187180,11197500," so what do we have here"
11197500,11197560," so what do we have here"
11197560,11199200," i want to actually remove that"
11199200,11199760," uh"
11199760,11201160," let me try to do this"
11201160,11201920," uh"
11201920,11202920," yep"
11202920,11203120," yep"
11203120,11203420," yep"
11203420,11205060," pipe"
11205060,11205720," c"
11205720,11207220," let's not output"
11207220,11208340," anything here"
11208340,11209700," yet"
11209700,11210360," at least"
11210360,11211500," yeah there we go"
11211500,11212800," it will print like everything"
11212800,11215540," it will print everything"
11215540,11218820," it's pretty interesting"
11218820,11227720," and we have an opportunity"
11227720,11228180," by the way"
11228180,11228480," since"
11228480,11229180," yeah"
11229180,11230820," since we don't depend"
11230820,11231980," on any shell"
11231980,11233620," we have an opportunity"
11233620,11234940," to make this functionality"
11234940,11236800," as powerful as we want"
11236800,11237640," right"
11237640,11239320," so we can implement functionality"
11239320,11240880," that is not supported by any shell"
11240880,11241420," right"
11241420,11243000," because we have like a very small"
11243000,11244800," like very fine control"
11244800,11246280," over how we redirect things"
11246280,11247200," uh"
11247200,11248280," yeah"
11248280,11249980," uh"
11249980,11251220," i don't know"
11251220,11252860," i'll have to think how we can do that"
11252860,11253860," um"
11253860,11254820," but yeah"
11254820,11256480," we may implement something interesting"
11256480,11258180," and we have an opportunity"
11258180,11258740," to make it"
11258740,11259660," cross-platform"
11259660,11260980," um"
11260980,11262660," all right"
11262660,11264280," implement"
11264280,11265240," uh"
11265240,11266560," no build"
11266560,11268080," syntax"
11268080,11268840," macros"
11268840,11269460," for"
11269460,11270360," pipe"
11270360,11271220," functionality"
11271220,11273100," pipe functionality"
11273100,11275100," pipe functionality"
11275100,11276000," let's push that right"
11276000,11278340," uh"
11278340,11280000," all right"
11280000,11280600," so"
11280600,11282200," what i want to do"
11282200,11283600," i want"
11283600,11285020," this example"
11285020,11285860," of the pipes"
11285860,11287040," to"
11287040,11288620," be cross-platform"
11288620,11290340," to make it"
11290340,11291080," cross-platform"
11291080,11291120," cross-platform"
11291120,11292020," cross-platform"
11292020,11292940," we need to implement"
11292940,11293880," some of these"
11293880,11294600," tools"
11294600,11295700," uh"
11295700,11296360," ourselves"
11296360,11299040," and compile"
11299040,11299840," them as well"
11299840,11301120," right"
11301120,11301960," so for example"
11301960,11302980," instead of hex dump"
11302980,11304200," we can use xxd"
11304200,11304840," right"
11304840,11305280," let's just"
11305280,11306340," just use xxd"
11306340,11307360," uh"
11307360,11308020," emacs"
11308020,11309200," there's something"
11309200,11310240," wrong with my keyboard"
11310240,11311220," because it doesn't register"
11311220,11311760," sometimes"
11311760,11314200," uh"
11314200,11314480," okay"
11314480,11315320," so as you can see"
11315320,11316120," xxd just"
11316120,11316980," gave us"
11316980,11317560," this thing"
11317560,11318520," uh"
11318520,11318820," right"
11318820,11319480," an xsd"
11319480,11320040," is actually"
11320040,11320840," a single c"
11320840,11321200," file"
11321200,11322020," that we can"
11322020,11322660," for example"
11322660,11323760," put into the"
11323760,11324140," tools"
11324140,11324980," right"
11324980,11325360," so"
11325360,11325840," uh"
11325840,11326320," let me find"
11326320,11326940," xxd"
11326940,11328240," uh"
11328240,11329180," xxd"
11329180,11330700," um"
11330700,11333420," source code"
11333420,11337720," and i can just"
11337720,11338300," grab that"
11338300,11339180," um"
11339180,11340020," i probably lost"
11340020,11340560," them when i"
11340560,11341060," fucked up"
11341060,11341640," the backup"
11341640,11342840," uh"
11342840,11343680," what"
11343680,11345120," okay"
11345120,11346720," uh"
11346720,11348320," all right"
11348320,11348840," so let's"
11348840,11349640," download this"
11349640,11349940," thing"
11349940,11352540," so the way"
11352540,11353200," we can do"
11353200,11353560," that"
11353560,11354100," uh"
11354100,11354680," in the no"
11354680,11355400," build script"
11355400,11356000," itself"
11356000,11356840," uh"
11356840,11357900," before trying"
11357900,11358480," to run"
11358480,11358780," of"
11358780,11359720," any of the"
11359720,11360200," examples"
11360200,11361560," we might as"
11361560,11362340," well also"
11362340,11362820," build"
11362820,11363580," the tools"
11363580,11363920," okay"
11363920,11364380," so"
11364380,11364980," um"
11364980,11367100," we can"
11367100,11367440," introduce"
11367440,11368460," something like"
11368460,11368980," check"
11368980,11370840," examples"
11370840,11371740," uh"
11371740,11373300," like this"
11373300,11374500," i'm gonna put"
11374500,11375220," everything there"
11375220,11376520," so here's the"
11376520,11377220," check examples"
11377220,11379740," and"
11379740,11381100," on top of this"
11381100,11381620," uh"
11381620,11382140," we wanna have"
11382140,11382640," something like"
11382640,11383180," build"
11383180,11384980," uh"
11384980,11386860," tools"
11386860,11388420," right"
11388420,11389120," build tools"
11389120,11390720," now we have"
11390720,11391000," noodles"
11391000,11391600," nice"
11391600,11394680," bon appetit"
11394680,11395760," my friend"
11395760,11397080," all right"
11397080,11398120," okay so"
11398120,11398680," uh"
11398680,11399020," i'm gonna"
11399020,11399500," iterate through"
11399500,11400060," the examples"
11400060,11401880," um"
11401880,11402780," i'm gonna"
11402780,11403120," build them"
11403120,11403620," the similar"
11403620,11404180," way we"
11404180,11404620," build"
11404620,11405180," uh"
11405180,11406060," the examples"
11406060,11407080," i'm gonna"
11407080,11407680," do tools"
11407680,11408620," then"
11408620,11409460," uh"
11409460,11409920," this one"
11409920,11410160," is gonna"
11410160,11410560," be just"
11410560,11412880," oh my"
11412880,11413120," god"
11413120,11414440," uh"
11414440,11415160," tool"
11415160,11416680," probably"
11416680,11418360," uh"
11418360,11419000," build"
11419000,11419660," a tool"
11419660,11420360," but how"
11420360,11420700," can we"
11420700,11421160," build it"
11421160,11421740," it will"
11421740,11422380," just depend"
11422380,11423060," on the"
11423060,11425180," win32"
11425180,11434080," so let's"
11434080,11434720," let's introduce"
11434720,11435140," function"
11435140,11435780," build tool"
11435780,11436740," build tool"
11436740,11437940," and it's gonna be"
11437940,11438740," const char"
11438740,11439960," tool"
11439960,11441200," file"
11441200,11443600," maybe it's gonna be"
11443600,11444040," just called"
11444040,11444420," tool"
11444420,11450620," so let's put it"
11450620,11451040," like this"
11451040,11451780," no extension"
11451780,11453100," so this is the"
11453100,11453700," name of the tool"
11453700,11454280," that you need to"
11454280,11454480," build"
11454480,11455860," and the way we"
11455860,11456740," build it is"
11456740,11457380," like this"
11457380,11457900," it's gonna be"
11457900,11458460," cmd"
11458460,11459660," cc"
11459660,11460980," or"
11460980,11463220," you can also"
11463220,11463760," do this"
11463760,11464980," c flag thingy"
11464980,11465400," right"
11465400,11466160," uh"
11466160,11466980," essentially like"
11466980,11467360," this"
11467360,11469140," a c flag"
11469140,11469760," thingy"
11469760,11471000," where are you"
11471000,11471440," gonna use"
11471440,11472120," a cc"
11472120,11473120," and then we"
11473120,11473520," also have"
11473520,11474120," c flags"
11474120,11474580," but then"
11474580,11475380," maybe for tools"
11475380,11476040," it's not really"
11476040,11476480," that important"
11476480,11476760," to have"
11476760,11477040," you have"
11477040,11477520," c flags"
11477520,11478220," because usually"
11478220,11478760," the developers"
11478760,11479240," don't care"
11479240,11480000," about c flags"
11480000,11480440," and whatnot"
11480440,11481900," uh"
11481900,11482460," so this one"
11482460,11482840," is gonna be"
11482840,11483240," path"
11483240,11484560," to tools"
11484560,11485820," then"
11485820,11487000," a tool"
11487000,11487480," and then"
11487480,11487720," we're gonna"
11487720,11488460," concat"
11488460,11489780," the tool"
11489780,11491040," now"
11491040,11491560," it's gonna"
11491560,11492160," be just this"
11492160,11492620," it's gonna"
11492620,11493560," be just a tool"
11493560,11494980," uh"
11494980,11495360," right"
11495360,11496160," and the input"
11496160,11496600," is gonna be"
11496600,11497020," path"
11497020,11498340," uh"
11498340,11498940," tools"
11498940,11501400," tool"
11501400,11503100," concat"
11503100,11503960," with"
11503960,11504680," dot c"
11504680,11506900," like this"
11506900,11507900," and that"
11507900,11508480," should do"
11508480,11509060," the trick"
11509060,11509560," hopefully"
11509560,11510040," at least"
11510040,11510440," for"
11510440,11511640," uh"
11511640,11512620," for linux"
11512620,11513360," all right"
11513360,11513740," and then"
11513740,11514280," we should be"
11514280,11514620," able to"
11514620,11515120," have that"
11515120,11515400," tool"
11515400,11516020," in there"
11516020,11519400," all right"
11519400,11520000," so"
11520000,11521160," uh"
11521160,11522240," yeah"
11522240,11522740," we're building"
11522740,11523160," everything"
11523160,11523700," so let me"
11523700,11524060," actually"
11524060,11524720," don't build"
11524720,11525240," the examples"
11525240,11525620," for now"
11525620,11525980," we're only"
11525980,11526520," gonna build"
11526520,11527140," the tools"
11527140,11528120," that we have"
11528120,11528400," there"
11528400,11529920," okay"
11529920,11530760," that built"
11530760,11531480," the tool"
11531480,11532200," uh"
11532200,11532620," and"
11532620,11534760," i'm gonna run"
11534760,11535420," the examples"
11535420,11537040," but in the examples"
11537040,11537680," i'm only gonna"
11537680,11538580," check the pipe"
11538580,11540220," right"
11540220,11540760," check"
11540760,11540860," example"
11540860,11541860," uh"
11541860,11545040," pipe"
11545040,11545900," let's see"
11545900,11546440," for some reason"
11546440,11546800," i actually"
11546800,11547460," accept the c"
11547460,11547800," here"
11547800,11548980," yeah there we go"
11548980,11550080," um"
11550080,11552100," and now"
11552100,11554320," in the pipe"
11554320,11557000," i'm not gonna"
11557000,11557800," do anything"
11557800,11558460," i'm gonna try"
11558460,11558840," to do"
11558840,11559520," something like"
11559520,11561320," path"
11561320,11563560," tools"
11563560,11565680," xxd"
11565680,11566860," you see"
11566860,11568780," tools"
11568780,11569580," xxd"
11569580,11571900," and"
11571900,11572820," it worked"
11572820,11573580," if i try to"
11573580,11574240," do something"
11574240,11574780," like this"
11574780,11576240," uh"
11576240,11576660," could not"
11576660,11576940," exact"
11576940,11577740," child process"
11577740,11578240," no file"
11578240,11578780," or directory"
11578780,11579120," okay"
11579120,11579720," that's cool"
11579720,11581460," uh"
11581460,11588080," is that"
11588080,11588640," addressed"
11588640,11589020," to me"
11589020,11589500," uh"
11589500,11590340," i don't know"
11590340,11591420," uh"
11591420,11592020," anabotho"
11592020,11592480," what's up"
11592480,11593000," anabotho"
11593000,11594100," welcome to the streamers"
11594100,11594900," um"
11594900,11599100," all right"
11599100,11600080," we have working"
11600080,11600980," pipes by the way"
11600980,11601420," in c"
11601420,11603100," look look"
11603100,11604140," you you can"
11604140,11604700," uh"
11604700,11605620," basically redirect"
11605620,11606860," uh from the file"
11606860,11607780," then you can"
11607780,11608560," chain several"
11608560,11609280," commands together"
11609280,11610760," uh and all that"
11610760,11611520," done without any"
11611520,11612220," external shells"
11612220,11613060," all that implemented"
11613060,11613840," purely in c"
11613840,11615740," so and that"
11615740,11616820," that actually works"
11616820,11617780," it's actually"
11617780,11618280," pretty cool"
11618280,11620820," uh"
11620820,11621620," okay"
11621620,11623260," and uh"
11623260,11623920," we're using"
11623920,11624820," like the actual"
11624820,11625740," thing here"
11625740,11626620," um"
11626620,11628260," so what we want"
11628260,11628640," to implement"
11628640,11630380," so implement"
11630380,11631540," base64"
11631540,11632900," um"
11632900,11634300," i'm definitely"
11634300,11634700," not going to"
11634700,11635360," implement gzip"
11635360,11636400," so fuck that"
11636400,11638340," base64"
11638340,11638960," i might as well"
11638960,11640080," implement base64"
11640080,11640660," why not"
11640660,11642900," um"
11642900,11645940," this is pretty"
11645940,11646380," impressive"
11646380,11653900," thank you"
11653900,11654880," just my neighbors"
11654880,11654880," it's just my neighbors"
11654880,11655920," are doing something"
11655920,11656240," weird"
11656240,11658320," doing something"
11658320,11658920," kinky"
11658920,11664340," it needs to be"
11664340,11665300," base69"
11665300,11666700," can i have"
11666700,11667880," uh"
11667880,11669400," 69 characters"
11669400,11670180," where can i get"
11670180,11671120," 69 characters"
11671120,11671420," though"
11671420,11676360," um"
11676360,11678000," 69"
11678000,11679160," printable characters"
11679160,11683800," cyrillic stuff"
11683800,11684440," cyrillic stuff"
11684440,11685060," with unicode"
11685060,11685520," we need"
11685520,11685780," uh"
11685780,11686480," ascii actually"
11686480,11690060," just need"
11690060,11690700," 17"
11690700,11693320," where is"
11693320,11694320," what"
11694320,11695840," am i missing"
11695840,11696320," something"
11696320,11697720," 17 symbols"
11697720,11698340," oh i mean"
11698340,11699440," 17 more"
11699440,11700100," no"
11700100,11703740," what am i missing"
11703740,11714080," ah"
11714080,11718340," wait"
11718340,11719140," 20"
11719140,11721440," oh you mean"
11721440,11721800," okay"
11721800,11722980," holy shit"
11722980,11728780," now that makes"
11728780,11729080," sense"
11729080,11729400," okay"
11729400,11729780," because"
11729780,11730780," you have"
11730780,11732000," 64 symbols"
11732000,11732400," already"
11732400,11733300," because otherwise"
11733300,11734660," base64 won't work"
11734660,11735360," you also have"
11735360,11736300," special characters"
11736300,11737220," don't forget about"
11737220,11737580," that"
11737580,11739060," you also have"
11739060,11739900," special characters"
11739900,11741380," um"
11741380,11745080," and also"
11745080,11746440," 64 is used"
11746440,11746920," because"
11746920,11747940," it's a power"
11747940,11748420," of two"
11748420,11750080," so you can"
11750080,11750580," easily"
11750580,11751400," uh"
11751400,11751880," you know"
11751880,11752720," split bits"
11752720,11753280," like that"
11753280,11755920," uh"
11755920,11756260," here"
11756260,11757680," your seven"
11757680,11758240," other characters"
11758240,11759180," yeah i don't think"
11759180,11759640," like you need"
11759640,11760380," the power of two"
11760380,11761600," and 69 is not"
11761600,11762220," the power of two"
11762220,11762760," to actually"
11762760,11763420," properly implement"
11763420,11764000," such encoding"
11764000,11764780," so i don't think"
11764780,11764960," it's"
11764960,11771900," all right"
11771900,11772620," so is there"
11772620,11773700," like a base64"
11773700,11774240," implementation"
11774240,11774940," that i can"
11774940,11775340," compile"
11775340,11776000," with a"
11776000,11777240," with a c"
11777240,11777600," compiler"
11777600,11780260," because maybe"
11780260,11780820," i don't have to"
11780820,11781260," implement it"
11781260,11781700," myself"
11781700,11782220," i don't"
11782220,11782700," don't want"
11782700,11783140," to implement"
11783140,11783640," it myself"
11783640,11785720," so"
11785720,11786820," copyright"
11786820,11787680," it's a"
11787680,11788940," it's part"
11788940,11789220," of the"
11789220,11789500," core"
11789500,11790160," utils"
11790160,11791560," can i"
11791560,11792260," literally"
11792260,11793640," it's"
11793640,11796400," if i"
11796400,11796580," cannot"
11796580,11796900," take"
11796900,11797160," their"
11797160,11797820," base64"
11797820,11798400," implementation"
11798400,11799040," and compile"
11799040,11799440," with just"
11799440,11799600," c"
11799600,11799960," compiler"
11799960,11800360," i'm gonna"
11800360,11800720," be very"
11800720,11801280," disappointed"
11801280,11802440," but that's"
11802440,11802800," probably what"
11802800,11803260," it is"
11803260,11805020," because they"
11805020,11805320," are very"
11805320,11805960," bureaucratic"
11805960,11806500," people"
11806500,11807380," new people"
11807380,11807800," i mean"
11807800,11809800," do i have"
11809800,11810180," a core"
11810180,11810500," utils"
11810500,11810960," i don't think"
11810960,11811500," i have a core"
11811500,11811940," utils"
11811940,11822360," also"
11822360,11825900," in"
11825900,11826660," pipe"
11826660,11828420," in here"
11828420,11829580," when i'm"
11829580,11830060," building the"
11830060,11830440," tools"
11830440,11830860," i want"
11830860,11831280," to be"
11831280,11831660," able to"
11831660,11831900," build"
11831900,11832200," them"
11832200,11832680," on"
11832680,11833280," windows"
11833280,11833940," as well"
11833940,11834380," all right"
11834380,11834820," so on"
11834820,11835160," windows"
11835160,11835560," we have"
11835560,11835920," to have"
11835920,11836420," a separate"
11836420,11836840," thing"
11836840,11837340," in there"
11837340,11839480," all right"
11839480,11840240," let's quickly"
11840240,11840740," do that"
11840740,11841640," let's quickly"
11841640,11842140," do that"
11842140,11843280," so it's"
11843280,11843580," gonna be"
11843580,11844160," like this"
11844160,11844880," if it's"
11844880,11845220," that"
11845220,11845920," else"
11845920,11848340," and if"
11848340,11849580," win32"
11849580,11851980," so this"
11851980,11852640," is"
11852640,11854760," tools"
11854760,11857500," and this"
11857500,11858100," is a"
11858100,11858500," tool"
11858500,11859000," but we"
11859000,11859380," also have"
11859380,11860080," to concat"
11860080,11860440," that"
11860440,11860940," with"
11860940,11861780," .c"
11861780,11865980," all right"
11865980,11867460," and that"
11867460,11867860," one"
11867860,11868660," yeah that"
11868660,11869040," one is"
11869040,11869440," not needed"
11869440,11869920," because we"
11869920,11870440," are just"
11870440,11871100," building the"
11871100,11871340," tools"
11871340,11871760," we're not"
11871760,11872260," really running"
11872260,11872520," them"
11872520,11872900," we're just"
11872900,11873180," building"
11873180,11873480," them"
11873480,11876480," okay"
11876480,11877940," and also"
11877940,11878360," here"
11878360,11878900," i want to"
11878900,11879260," do this"
11879260,11879600," thing"
11879600,11881440," so the"
11881440,11881760," tools are"
11881760,11882320," very important"
11882320,11883360," for the"
11883360,11883760," pipe"
11883760,11884440," all right"
11884440,11884760," so they're"
11884760,11885280," very important"
11885280,11885600," for the"
11885600,11885840," pipe"
11885840,11888260," okay"
11888260,11889300," so we're"
11889300,11889520," building"
11889520,11890020," everything"
11890020,11890780," testing"
11890780,11891380," everything"
11891380,11892260," on linux"
11892260,11892640," it kind"
11892640,11893160," of works"
11893160,11894420," but to be"
11894420,11894800," fair on"
11894800,11895120," linux"
11895120,11895820," for now"
11895820,11897480," we can"
11897480,11897980," just keep"
11897980,11898580," it super"
11898580,11899120," simple"
11899120,11910800," something"
11910800,11911420," something"
11911420,11911840," is wrong"
11911840,11912140," with me"
11912140,11912580," i'm a little"
11912580,11913120," bit tired"
11913120,11914440," i'm a little"
11914440,11914840," bit tired"
11914840,11915860," okay"
11915860,11916580," so for"
11916580,11916940," now we"
11916940,11917300," can just"
11917300,11917720," keep it"
11917720,11918120," like that"
11918120,11918700," i suppose"
11918700,11919280," it's just"
11919280,11919600," gonna be"
11919600,11919840," pipe"
11919840,11920120," let's"
11920120,11920360," see"
11920360,11925000," and then"
11925000,11925300," we can"
11925300,11925760," make it"
11925760,11926140," more"
11926140,11926480," later"
11926480,11927280," so i'm"
11927280,11927700," trying to"
11927700,11928360," wrap up"
11928360,11928960," the work"
11928960,11929340," on that"
11929340,11929620," pipe"
11929620,11930240," thingy"
11930240,11933960," pipes do"
11933960,11934300," not allow"
11934300,11934840," redirecting"
11934840,11935220," std"
11935220,11935440," error"
11935440,11935740," yes"
11935740,11936080," it is"
11936080,11936540," in fact"
11936540,11936860," true"
11936860,11938820," all right"
11938820,11939860," so let's"
11939860,11940240," do a"
11940240,11940480," committee"
11940480,11940900," committee"
11940900,11941760," and then"
11941760,11942040," push"
11942040,11942420," push"
11942420,11942660," sure"
11942660,11945220," i didn't"
11945220,11945460," want"
11945460,11945620," to"
11945620,11946040," commit"
11946040,11946260," there"
11946260,11946620," though"
11946620,11948560," it's"
11948560,11949020," ignore"
11949020,11975620," so what did"
11975620,11975860," i do"
11975860,11975860," do"
11975860,11976240," here"
11976240,11981420," introduce"
11981420,11982420," tools"
11982420,11983140," that"
11983140,11983660," could"
11983660,11984020," be"
11984020,11985480," useful"
11985480,11986440," for"
11986440,11987160," testing"
11987160,11988120," examples"
11988120,11989900," all right"
11989900,11990580," so let's"
11990580,11991000," push that"
11991000,11991360," right into"
11991360,11991700," the repo"
11991700,11997000," so and"
11997000,11997500," yeah"
11997500,11999780," it's pretty"
11999780,12000200," cool that"
12000200,12000620," we have"
12000620,12001800," tools"
12001800,12002940," we have"
12002940,12004320," examples"
12004320,12005540," that use"
12005540,12006120," those tools"
12006120,12007720," and all"
12007720,12008100," of that"
12008100,12008740," is built"
12008740,12009340," and brought"
12009340,12009880," together"
12009880,12011860," just using"
12011860,12012400," only c"
12012400,12012680," code"
12012680,12013480," we don't"
12013480,12014140," use that"
12014140,12014580," we don't"
12014580,12015100," use shell"
12015100,12015480," for that"
12015480,12016080," or anything"
12016080,12016480," it's just"
12016480,12016940," like purely"
12016940,12017220," c"
12017220,12017440," code"
12017440,12018420," right so"
12018420,12019340," the the"
12019340,12020160," build of"
12020160,12020660," the build"
12020660,12021540," system itself"
12021540,12022240," becomes more"
12022240,12022560," and more"
12022560,12023020," complex"
12023020,12023480," actually"
12023480,12024760," it's good"
12024760,12025060," it's kind"
12025060,12025320," of cool"
12025320,12025640," i think"
12025640,12027460," yeah"
12027460,12029060," i think"
12029060,12029340," it's kind"
12029340,12029660," of cool"
12029660,12030860," one of the"
12030860,12031320," things we can"
12031320,12032180," probably implement"
12032180,12032840," is like"
12032840,12033680," rod 13"
12033680,12034700," right"
12034700,12035840," rod 13"
12035840,12036760," also could"
12036760,12037200," be a pretty"
12037200,12037520," cool"
12037520,12038720," thing to"
12038720,12039040," implement"
12039040,12040640," yeah"
12040640,12041300," okay"
12041300,12042200," so let's"
12042200,12042460," do the"
12042460,12042660," following"
12042660,12042980," thing"
12042980,12043480," i'm gonna"
12043480,12044540," just commit"
12044540,12045040," whatever we"
12045040,12045300," have"
12045300,12045840," and we"
12045840,12046360," can spend"
12046360,12046820," the rest"
12046820,12047340," of the"
12047340,12048220," stream"
12048220,12048740," coming up"
12048740,12048900," with"
12048900,12049220," different"
12049220,12049720," tools"
12049720,12050760," for testing"
12050760,12051280," pipes"
12051280,12054480," rod 26"
12054480,12057920," so yeah"
12057920,12058980," maybe it"
12058980,12059400," would make"
12059400,12059840," sense to"
12059840,12060220," get rid"
12060220,12060480," of the"
12060480,12060940," xdd"
12060940,12062100," xxd"
12062100,12062760," and have"
12062760,12063300," only our"
12063300,12063900," own tools"
12063900,12065040," we'll"
12065040,12065220," see"
12065220,12066680," let's"
12066680,12066800," just"
12066800,12066960," create"
12066960,12067200," a pull"
12067200,12067580," request"
12067580,12068260," and"
12068260,12069860," yes"
12069860,12070660," so"
12070660,12073120," what did"
12073120,12073340," we do"
12073340,12073620," here"
12073620,12074360," implement"
12074360,12074740," a working"

12075020,12075600," functionality"
12075600,12075920," on"
12075920,12076420," postx"
12076420,12076860," yes"
12076860,12077560," this is"
12077560,12077800," actually"
12077800,12078160," super"
12078160,12078480," cool"
12078480,12079440," and"
12079440,12080520," the"
12080520,12081460," difficulty"
12081460,12081780," of"

12082300,12082800," this"
12082800,12083820," is"
12083820,12084560," equal"

12090580,12092900," okay"
12092900,12093200," let me"
12093200,12093460," take a"
12093460,12093560," look"

12256140,12256360," now"
12256360,12259020," so where"

12499700,12500700," you"
12500700,12504700," yeah it's kind of reusable on on linux on on windows and whatnot"
12504700,12505700," but not really"
12505700,12518700," because we have spawn for windows when we use we used cmd"
12518700,12537700," yes so cdm is cmd implementation right"
12537700,12542700," no build exec yeah yeah this is basically what i do here and i'm using spawn uh spawn vp and i wonder yeah so i need to somehow clean everything up and bring everything together"
12542700,12570700," so there's a lot of technical depth in this lab brain but there's a lot of technical depth in this lab brain but this is a lot of technical depth in this lab brain but i need to somehow clean everything up and bring everything together and bring everything together so there's a lot of technical depth in this lab brain but i need to somehow clean everything up and bring everything together and bring everything together so there's a lot of technical depth in this lab brain but i need to somehow clean everything up and bring everything up and bring everything together so there's a lot of technical depth in this lab brain but"
12570700,12582040," but turn value is the exit status."
12582040,12584280," Okay, so yeah, it's a synchronous one,"
12584280,12589120," but if it's a synchronous one, it is the process handle."
12589120,12590560," Okay, that's cool."
12599020,12606020," So essentially, I want to reuse the code from pipe,"
12606020,12609020," but for Windows and whatnot."
12609020,12623280," I'm sure if I'll be able to do it right now, but yeah."
12627340,12634340," Okay, let's just go ahead and do that."
12634340,12634340," Spawn CMD."
12634340,12634340," Edit compile for CMD."
12634340,12635340," Okay."
12635340,12641340," Spawn CMD."
12641340,12641340," I did compile for CMD."
12641340,12641340," Okay."
12641340,12641340," Spawn CMD."
12641340,12642340," Spawn CMD."
12642340,12648340," I did compile for CMD."
12648340,12649340," Okay."
12649340,12650340," Spawn CMD."
12650340,12651340," Okay."
12651340,12655340," Spawn CMD."
12655340,12655340," Okay."
12655340,12656340," Spawn CMD."
12656340,12657340," Plus six."
12657340,12658340," Spawn CMD."
12658340,12660340," Spawn CMD."
12660340,12661340," Plus six."
12661340,12665340," Spawn CMD."
12665340,12666340," Okay."
12666340,12667340," Okay."
12667340,12668340," Okay."
12668340,12669340," Okay."
12669340,12670340," Okay."
12695340,12706340," So I also want to rename this thing too."
12706340,12716340," Is it something with my keyboard?"
12716340,12722340," But the pipe definition should be like the same everywhere, I think."
12722340,12723340," Okay."
12723340,12724340," Alright."
12724340,12737340," So now when I have a pipe, I know build posx spawn pipe and something like this, if def win"
12737340,12751340," 32, we're going to just do it like this, pipe, uh-huh, doom, panic."
12751340,12761340," So, and, uh, pipe is not implemented on windows yet."
12761340,12762340," Okay."
12762340,12766340," Piping is not implemented on windows yet."
12766340,12769340," So that's essentially what we're going to say here."
12769340,12778340," Uh, I don't have to wrap it in, uh, in this thing."
12778340,12781340," I have to wrap it in this thing actually."
12781340,12787340," Uh, otherwise, and if."
12787340,12788340," Cool."
12788340,12789340," Cool."
12789340,12791340," Mm-hmm."
12791340,12792340," Mm-hmm."
12792340,12793340," Nice."
12793340,12799340," And now, all of these definitions in here."
12799340,12805340," So, make pipe, okay, spawn pipe and stuff like that."
12805340,12809340," So, I might as well put it somewhere here."
12809340,12820340," Uh, if in def, uh, win, uh, 32."
12820340,12821340," And if."
12821340,12822340," Win 32."
12822340,12823340," Right."
12823340,12824340," Still compiles."
12824340,12833340," So, here's the spawn pipe, spawn cmd."
12833340,12836340," Spawn pipe, spawn cmd."
12836340,12837340," Uh-huh."
12837340,12839340," So, what is that?"
12839340,12840340," Uh-huh."
12840340,12841340," So, what is that?"
12841340,12842340," Yeah."
12842340,12843340," It's, it's that thing."
12843340,12846340," If in def, win 32."
12846340,12847340," Mm-hmm."
12847340,12848340," Win 32."
12848340,12853340," It's actually pretty cool that I managed to pull that off."
12853340,12854340," Holy shit."
12854340,12855340," I can't believe that."
12855340,12856340," Um."
12856340,12860340," Did I, did I not ignore that?"
12860340,12861340," Uh-huh."
12861340,12862340," Uh-huh."
12862340,12863340," Uh-huh."
12863340,12881340," Try to make everything compilable on windows."
12881340,12886340," Uh, where was the additional A?"
12886340,12888340," Where?"
12888340,12889340," Uh-huh."
12889340,12890340," Okay."
12890340,12891340," Thank you."
12891340,12898340," I didn't do that intentionally."
12898340,12900340," I didn't know what exactly is going on."
12900340,12902340," Something with, maybe with my keyboard."
12902340,12904340," Or maybe with the way I type, like."
12904340,12912340," Where?"
12912340,12913340," Uh."
12918340,12919340," Uh-huh."
12919340,12920340," Okay."
12920340,12921340," Thank you."
12921340,12922340," Remove extra."
12922340,12923340," Cool."
12923340,12928340," Remove extra. Cool."
12953340,12980340," Right. So let me check how all of that looks on here."
12980340,12985340," Okay, so it does the trick. It does the trick, which is nice."
12985340,12996340," What about Windows? On Windows it should just say it's not supported on Windows."
12996340,13007340," Okay, cool. So another interesting thing is that I want to have an issue."
13007340,13020340," I want to be able to reuse this entire stuff, but I'm not sure how to do that."
13020340,13025340," Maybe I'm not going to even create any to do this for that."
13025340,13032340," To do pipes do not allow redirecting. Yes, I need to snitch it up."
13032340,13038340," Excuse me. Maybe I can do something like this."
13038340,13051340," Snitch report. Repend body. Introduced in 19."
13051340,13066340," Let's push that."
13066340,13071340," This is pretty..."
13071340,13074340," It's too much code."
13074340,13076340," It's too much code."
13076340,13079340," And this is primarily because of the XXD."
13079340,13080340," Right."
13080340,13083340," An XSD doesn't really do anything special, to be fair."
13083340,13085340," Right. It doesn't even do anything special."
13085340,13091340," Let's actually implement our own XXD and whatnot."
13095340,13097340," Should be produced right forward."
13097340,13098340," So hex C."
13098340,13099340," So..."
13099340,13100340," Stdio."
13100340,13101340," Stdlib."
13101340,13102340," H."
13102340,13103340," And for example, you have the width."
13103340,13104340," The amount of columns that you're going to do for the hex."
13104340,13105340," Right."
13105340,13106340," So let's actually hard code that."
13106340,13107340," Columns."
13107340,13109340," And let's say that we're going to have 20 of them."
13109340,13112340," And because of that, we want to allocate a buffer."
13112340,13113340," Some sort of a buffer."
13113340,13114340," Of this amount of columns."
13114340,13115340," It's almost like I'm programming an ADO."
13115340,13116340," Right."
13116340,13117340," So I define the size of the columns."
13117340,13118340," And then I use that to index the array."
13118340,13119340," All right."
13119340,13120340," So while..."
13120340,13121340," The amount of columns."
13121340,13122340," The amount of columns that you're going to do for the hex."
13122340,13123340," Right."
13123340,13124340," So let's actually hard code that."
13124340,13125340," Columns."
13125340,13126340," And let's say that we're going to have 20 of them."
13126340,13127340," And because of that."
13127340,13128340," We want to allocate a buffer."
13128340,13129340," Some sort of a buffer."
13129340,13130340," Of this amount of columns."
13130340,13131340," It's almost like I'm programming an ADO."
13131340,13132340," Right."
13132340,13133340," So I define the..."
13133340,13134340," The size of the columns."
13134340,13135340," And then I use that to index the array."
13135340,13136340," All right."
13136340,13137340," So while..."
13137340,13138340," The size of the columns."
13138340,13140340," And then I use that to index the array."
13140340,13141340," All right."
13141340,13143340," So while..."
13143340,13148340," Not_end_of_file_std_in."
13148340,13150340," I can read."
13150340,13151340," Right."
13151340,13154340," I can read this entire buffer."
13154340,13156340," And let me see."
13156340,13158340," We're going to use fread function."
13158340,13162340," So essentially I just do it like that."
13162340,13163340," Right."
13163340,13165340," So I'm going to provide the buffer."
13165340,13167340," The size of the element."
13167340,13169340," Of a single element that I want to read."
13169340,13172340," Is going to be a size of buffer 0."
13172340,13174340," And the amount of elements I want to read."
13174340,13177340," I want to read the columns of the elements."
13177340,13179340," And I want to read it from the standard input."
13179340,13180340," Right."
13180340,13182340," And then I can have N."
13182340,13183340," Right."
13183340,13186340," So this is how many actually I read there."
13186340,13188340," So..."
13188340,13190340," Now..."
13190340,13192340," What I'm going to be doing here."
13192340,13195340," I'm going to be iterating through each individual byte in here."
13195340,13197340," And just printing it in hex."
13197340,13198340," Simply printing it in hex."
13198340,13200340," Simply printing it in hex."
13200340,13202340," Right."
13202340,13206340," Yeah."
13206340,13207340," I think that's good."
13207340,13208340," It's going to be printf."
13208340,13210340," X."
13210340,13211340," Actually capital X."
13211340,13212340," And then space."
13212340,13214340," All right."
13214340,13216340," And it's going to be just char."
13216340,13217340," Actually not char."
13217340,13218340," But buffer."
13218340,13219340," Right."
13219340,13220340," But there's something about XXD."
13220340,13221340," Right."
13221340,13226340," It also prints the ASCII version of itself."
13226340,13227340," Right."
13227340,13229340," It also prints an ASCII version of itself."
13229340,13233340," So to do that, we're going to also print a little bit of padding."
13233340,13234340," Right."
13234340,13235340," So..."
13235340,13238340," Padding."
13238340,13241340," And how much we're going to pad in there."
13241340,13242340," Well..."
13242340,13247340," Can I pad with spaces quite easily?"
13247340,13249340," I don't quite remember."
13249340,13256340," One, two, three, four, five, six."
13256340,13258340," So this is what we're going to have here."
13258340,13261340," Right."
13261340,13262340," And..."
13262340,13265340," What's interesting is that I can now try to do the following thing."
13265340,13266340," I can now try to print."
13266340,13268340," Uh..."
13268340,13269340," If write the entire buffer."
13269340,13270340," So it's going to be if write."
13270340,13272340," Size of a single thing here."
13272340,13274340," Uh..."
13274340,13276340," And then the amount of things I've got."
13276340,13277340," But that's kind of dangerous."
13277340,13278340," Right."
13278340,13279340," That's kind of dangerous."
13279340,13280340," Because..."
13280340,13282340," It may contain special characters."
13282340,13283340," Non-printable characters."
13283340,13285340," And so on and so forth."
13285340,13286340," So before..."
13286340,13288340," Uh..."
13288340,13289340," We can do any of these things."
13289340,13291340," We want to iterate through everything here."
13291340,13292340," And..."
13292340,13293340," Normalize everything."
13293340,13294340," To be fair."
13294340,13296340," We're already iterating through the buffer."
13296340,13298340," We might as well actually do it here."
13298340,13299340," Right."
13299340,13300340," So..."
13300340,13303340," We need to check if the character in the buffer."
13303340,13305340," Is..."
13305340,13306340," Uh..."
13306340,13307340," Printable or not."
13307340,13308340," So..."
13308340,13309340," In C types."
13309340,13310340," We have something."
13310340,13311340," So..."
13311340,13311340," Uh..."
13311340,13312340," To find the C type."
13312340,13314340," I can look for isDigit thingy."
13314340,13317340," And also look for everything is in C type."
13317340,13318340," Uh..."
13318340,13320340," So there is a function called isPrint."
13320340,13322340," Does it do what I think it does?"
13322340,13325340," Checks whether any printable character including space."
13325340,13326340," Uh..."
13326340,13327340," All right."
13327340,13328340," So maybe that's exactly what we want."
13328340,13329340," Uh..."
13329340,13330340," So if isPrint."
13330340,13331340," Buffer."
13331340,13332340," I."
13332340,13334340," And it's not printable."
13334340,13338340," We are replacing this entire thing with a dot."
13338340,13341340," We're replacing this entire thing with a dot."
13341340,13343340," That's it!"
13343340,13348340," That..."
13348340,13349340," That's it?"
13349340,13350340," Seriously?"
13351340,13352340," Um..."
13352340,13353340," Should be at least."
13353340,13354340," I don't know."
13354340,13355340," We can try to compile it."
13355340,13356340," Uh..."
13356340,13357340," Let me remove all of that."
13357340,13358340," And..."
13358340,13359340," Uh..."
13359340,13360340," I'm gonna try to build this entire thing."
13360340,13362340," Of course it's not gonna build."
13362340,13363340," Uh..."
13363340,13364340," Because..."
13364340,13365340," Yeah."
13365340,13366340," We need to print CC type."
13366340,13367340," Uh..."
13367340,13368340," Or C type."
13368340,13369340," C type."
13369340,13370340," Uh..."
13370340,13370340," And..."
13370340,13371340," So it does not compile."
13371340,13372340," Because..."
13372340,13372340," Uh..."
13372340,13373340," It couldn't exact."
13373340,13374340," Uh..."
13374340,13375340," The XXD."
13375340,13378340," So we have to go to examples and pipe."
13378340,13379340," Uh..."
13379340,13380340," Right."
13380340,13381340," In XXD."
13381340,13382340," We have to use hex."
13382340,13383340," Right."
13383340,13384340," And let's see what's gonna happen."
13384340,13385340," Uh..."
13385340,13386340," There you go."
13386340,13389340," That was very interesting."
13389340,13390340," Uh..."
13390340,13393340," And this is because I didn't pad with zeros correctly."
13393340,13394340," Right."
13394340,13395340," If we change it slightly here."
13395340,13397340," So it's gonna be something like this."
13397340,13398340," Uh..."
13398340,13400340," Now it is padded more or less correctly."
13400340,13401340," Look at that."
13401340,13404340," So..."
13404340,13405340," Yeah."
13405340,13406340," So..."
13406340,13407340," Like to implement."
13407340,13408340," Okay."
13408340,13409340," This one is interesting."
13409340,13410340," All right."
13410340,13411340," Here's an interesting bug."
13411340,13412340," Right."
13412340,13413340," Uh..."
13413340,13416340," We need to pad this shit accordingly."
13416340,13417340," Um..."
13417340,13418340," All right."
13418340,13419340," This one is interesting actually."
13419340,13420340," So..."
13420340,13421340," It becomes more interesting."
13421340,13422340," Uh..."
13422340,13423340," As we go."
13423340,13424340," Also..."
13424340,13427340," I might as well go to no build.c."
13427340,13428340," All right."
13428340,13429340," And..."
13429340,13431340," Exclude all of the examples yet again."
13431340,13433340," Because I wanna focus on the pipe example."
13433340,13434340," Right."
13434340,13435340," Example..."
13435340,13436340," Uh..."
13436340,13437340," Pipe."
13437340,13438340," Let's see."
13438340,13439340," Right."
13439340,13440340," So we only wanna check this example."
13440340,13441340," There we go."
13441340,13442340," Uh..."
13442340,13443340," Hex.c."
13443340,13444340," Mm-hmm."
13444340,13445340," So..."
13445340,13446340," Um..."
13446340,13447340," Padding."
13447340,13448340," Six."
13448340,13449340," Right."
13449340,13450340," Mm..."
13450340,13451340," Padding."
13451340,13452340," Six."
13452340,13453340," You know what I wanna be able to do?"
13453340,13454340," I wanna be able to print n amount of spaces."
13454340,13455340," Right."
13455340,13456340," Mm..."
13456340,13457340," N amount of spaces."
13457340,13458340," Do I wanna have a function for that?"
13458340,13459340," I might as well have a function for that."
13459340,13460340," Uh..."
13460340,13461340," Do we have already that?"
13461340,13462340," I don't think we have that."
13462340,13463340," Right."
13463340,13464340," I don't think we have that."
13464340,13465340," Right."
13465340,13466340," I don't think we have that."
13466340,13469340," Print char n times."
13469340,13470340," So..."
13470340,13471340," I have no idea how to code better."
13471340,13472340," Unfortunately."
13472340,13473340," Uh..."
13473340,13474340," So..."
13474340,13476340," We're gonna have a char and then we're gonna have a n."
13476340,13477340," So..."
13477340,13481340," And the way we're gonna do that, we're gonna just iterate through zero to n."
13481340,13482340," And we're gonna just do putsy."
13482340,13483340," Uh..."
13483340,13485340," Are you sure it's gonna be like that?"
13485340,13486340," Okay."
13486340,13487340," So..."
13487340,13488340," So..."
13488340,13489340," I have no idea how to code better."
13489340,13490340," Unfortunately."
13490340,13491340," Uh..."
13491340,13493340," So we're gonna have a char and then we're gonna have a n."
13493340,13494340," So..."
13494340,13499340," And the way we're gonna do that, we're gonna just iterate through zero to n."
13499340,13502340," And we're gonna just do putsy."
13502340,13504340," Uh..."
13504340,13510340," Are you sure it's gonna be like that?"
13510340,13511340," Okay."
13511340,13512340," So..."
13512340,13513340," Let me try that."
13513340,13514340," Uh..."
13514340,13515340," So..."
13515340,13517340," Print f..."
13517340,13518340," Uh..."
13518340,13519340," S..."
13519340,13520340," Uh..."
13520340,13521340," Padding..."
13521340,13524340," It's only for spaces."
13524340,13529340," Is that an empty?"
13529340,13531340," Okay."
13531340,13532340," You don't..."
13532340,13533340," You don't know that."
13533340,13534340," Alright."
13534340,13535340," Uh..."
13535340,13536340," Alright."
13536340,13541340," What if I put this thing here?"
13542340,13543340," Ah..."
13543340,13544340," Ah..."
13544340,13547340," Hmm..."
13547340,13550340," Not bad."
13550340,13551340," Not bad at all."
13551340,13552340," So..."
13552340,13553340," And..."
13553340,13555340," On top of that, we can do the following thing."
13555340,13556340," Um..."
13556340,13557340," Plus..."
13557340,13559340," Columns..."
13559340,13563340," Uh..."
13563340,13564340," Alright."
13564340,13565340," So let me give it a try."
13565340,13566340," Uh..."
13566340,13567340," C..."
13567340,13568340," Uh..."
13568340,13569340," C..."
13569340,13571340," And then we can try something like this."
13571340,13573340," Uh..."
13573340,13574340," Columns..."
13574340,13575340," Minus n."
13575340,13576340," By the way, there is assertion here."
13576340,13577340," Uh..."
13577340,13580340," That n is less or equal to columns."
13580340,13581340," Uh..."
13581340,13582340," Uh..."
13582340,13583340," Columns..."
13583340,13585340," Minus n."
13585340,13587340," By the way, there is assertion here."
13587340,13589340," Uh..."
13589340,13592340," That n is less or equal to columns."
13592340,13594340," Uh..."
13594340,13595340," This is quite important."
13595340,13596340," Multiply by three."
13596340,13597340," Uh..."
13597340,13598340," Yep."
13599340,13600340," Uh..."
13600340,13600340," Yep."
13600340,13605340," Assertage."
13605340,13607340," Yeah."
13607340,13608340," That worked."
13608340,13611340," Okay."
13611340,13612340," Thank you."
13612340,13617340," Mm-hmm."
13617340,13620340," So there is like a simple formula in here."
13620340,13623340," Do you really need this last thing in here?"
13623340,13624340," Do you really?"
13624340,13628340," I think you do because it's set faults otherwise."
13629340,13630340," Yeah."
13630340,13631340," All right."
13631340,13632340," That's cool."
13632340,13633340," So basically, it's additional padding for..."
13633340,13634340," Okay."
13634340,13634340," Okay."
13634340,13635340," That's cool."
13635340,13636340," Thank you."
13636340,13637340," Thank you so much."
13637340,13638340," And you don't even need additional thing in here."
13638340,13639340," Right."
13639340,13641340," And you can quite easily change the amount of columns."
13641340,13642340," There you go."
13642340,13644340," And you can change the padding."
13644340,13645340," You can make it like 10."
13645340,13648340," And you see it's like a runtime constant."
13648340,13650340," And it could be two if you want."
13650340,13651340," Sure."
13651340,13653340," Uh..."
13653340,13654340," But yeah, we can go with six."
13654340,13655340," So..."
13655340,13657340," Yeah."
13657340,13658340," It's pretty cool."
13659340,13662340," Yeah, it's okay."
13662340,13666340," Let's give it a try."
13666340,13673340," Uh..."
13673340,13674340," Uh..."
13674340,13675340," Uh-huh."
13675340,13680340," Am I doing something correctly?"
13680340,13682340," I don't think I'm doing something correctly."
13682340,13683340," Nah."
13683340,13684340," Nah."
13684340,13685340," But..."
13685340,13688340," Oh, yeah."
13688340,13689340," It's still..."
13689340,13690340," It's still for..."
13690340,13691340," It's the same as S."
13691340,13692340," Yeah."
13692340,13693340," It's the same as S."
13693340,13694340," Uh..."
13694340,13695340," Let's..."
13695340,13696340," Yeah."
13696340,13697340," Yeah."
13697340,13700340," I think this is a pretty good solution."
13700340,13702340," So that should be okay."
13702340,13703340," Um..."
13703340,13704340," Um..."
13704340,13707340," Oh, and we need to check how it works with binary shit."
13707340,13709340," We need to check how it works with binary shit."
13709340,13710340," I'm gonna go to the pipe."
13710340,13713340," Uh..."
13713340,13716340," And let's pipe the binary version of it."
13716340,13718340," Let's pipe the binary version of it."
13718340,13720340," Oh shit."
13720340,13721340," What the fuck is that?"
13723340,13724340," Oh."
13724340,13728340," Excuse me."
13728340,13733340," Sometimes it goes negative."
13733340,13734340," I see."
13734340,13736340," Okay."
13736340,13737340," That's..."
13737340,13738340," That was actually a pretty good idea."
13738340,13739340," To do..."
13739340,13740340," To do that."
13740340,13741340," So..."
13741340,13742340," To fix that."
13742340,13744340," We may try to include std int."
13744340,13748340," And maybe have something like uint8t instead."
13748340,13752340," Yeah."
13752340,13753340," Um..."
13753340,13754340," So it was just..."
13754340,13755340," Yeah."
13755340,13756340," Sometimes charts were negative."
13756340,13757340," Uh..."
13757340,13758340," But yeah."
13758340,13759340," Apart from that, you see..."
13759340,13760340," Um..."
13760340,13763340," It can even deal with unprintable characters as well."
13763340,13765340," So that's pretty cool."
13765340,13767340," And that's how much code it took."
13767340,13769340," To implement something like this."
13769340,13771340," So you don't need an entire xxd to..."
13771340,13772340," To have this thing."
13772340,13774340," I think that's pretty cool."
13774340,13779340," Alrighty."
13779340,13780340," So..."
13780340,13781340," Uh..."
13781340,13782340," So in tools..."
13782340,13783340," Uh..."
13783340,13784340," I'm gonna git ignore."
13784340,13785340," To hex."
13785340,13786340," Right?"
13786340,13790340," Uh..."
13790340,13791340," And let's just..."
13791340,13792340," Let's just do that."
13792340,13796340," Hmm."
13796340,13799340," That would be a really cool code growth program."
13799340,13800340," Probably."
13800340,13801340," Uh..."
13801340,13803340," It probably would be."
13804340,13805340," Uh..."
13805340,13806340," Also in here..."
13806340,13807340," Uh..."
13807340,13808340," I wanna still use the C."
13808340,13809340," Right."
13809340,13810340," Uh..."
13810340,13811340," Uh..."
13811340,13812340," Uh..."
13812340,13813340," Mm-hmm."
13813340,13814340," Okay."
13814340,13815340," So..."
13815340,13816340," And we know for sure that it's cross-platform."
13816340,13817340," Right?"
13817340,13818340," Because it uses only the standard library and whatnot."
13818340,13818340," And..."
13818340,13819340," Yeah."
13819340,13820340," It's..."
13820340,13820340," It's pretty pogue."
13820340,13821340," I'm not gonna lie."
13821340,13822340," Just a hex thing."
13822340,13823340," Mm-hmm."
13823340,13824340," Um..."
13824340,13825340," Mm-hmm."
13825340,13825340," Mm-hmm."
13825340,13826340," Mm-hmm."
13826340,13827340," Mm-hmm."
13827340,13828340," Um..."
13828340,13831780," it's pretty pogue not gonna lie just a hex thing"
13831780,13855860," um replace xxd with hex"
13858340,13868820," refresh"
13888340,13898900," okay one of the things uh yeah we want to do is to implement road 13 right let's let's go ahead and"
13898900,13913460," implement road 13 um right 13 c um so it's to do out and i think we can have something like road 13 for"
13913460,13923380," a single character let's actually do that for a single character uh and essentially if it is alpha"
13923380,13932980," so it has to be half what it has to be a c type right um we can do something like that if x uh starting"
13932980,13941460," from a uh and x is less than z uh we're going to return x minus a"
13947300,13961620," plus 13 mod 26 mod 26 plus a back now uh we also have another wrench"
13961620,13969940," for this kind of stuff otherwise we just return that so this is the simplest road 13 here"
13971940,13981060," um okay also we can have uh columns here as well and uh might as well call it buffer size right so"
13981060,13989940," here's the buffer size and let's say we can have um i don't know 240 000 right so then we can pre-locate"
13989940,13999140," get this buffer um of characters in here uh buffer size and then while"
13999140,14012260," and the file stdin we're reading into the buffer the size of a single character is this the amount"
14012260,14018180," of characters is a buffer size and we're reading all that from the standard input so and then we also"
14018180,14023860," have the size of this entire thing then i'm iterating through each individual character right i'm"
14023860,14034260," iterating it like that and uh i do buffer i rod 13 buffer i cool and then i want to write it back"
14034260,14043460," it's going to be buffer uh size both buffer zero instead of buffer size i'm going to use n and i'm writing"
14043460,14048500," that's going to continue to ssstd out so that's it that's the whole rod 13 implementation"
14048500,14054820," now i'm going to go to the pipe example i'm going to go to the pipe example and i'm going"
14054820,14059860," to replace hex with uh rod 13 just to see what's going to happen better"
14059860,14069940," all right so here is the rod 13 um that was interesting so what does it use it uses yeah so"
14069940,14075860," basically this is how this source code looks like after red 13 so this is how it looks like"
14075860,14084260," uh furthermore uh now we have an opportunity to pipe more things right so we can now try to pipe"
14084260,14096660," uh all of that into hex right so yeah there we go so essentially yeah we piped it into rod 13 and then we"
14096660,14102500," piped it into hex and look how perfectly it aligned after that uh that's actually amazing"
14102500,14116420," so cool so now we also have rod 13 it was as easy as this um it was as easy as this"
14124260,14130580," um so in the tools and uh these tools will eventually also work on uh on windows at least they should"
14130580,14140500," i think uh rod 13. what is rod 13 let me google that for you buddy"
14148180,14171300," okay add rod 13 uh example uh red 13 tool for pipe example okay and let's push that what about about 26"
14171300,14174980," it's cat"
14178180,14186500," oh by the way twice so far we can actually confirm that it works uh right so i can do cat uh example"
14186500,14196100," pipe c and i can pipe it into the tools uh row 13 right so and this is how it looks like but what if"
14196100,14202820," i pipe it twice will it work as well so this is like the ultimate uh you know yeah it works so it actually"
14202820,14212340," brings it back so"
14212340,14223060," it's id there's no such thing as id on posix well i mean it's definitely not rod 26"
14224420,14230900," there is id but it's not rod 26 something like cat looks more like rod 26 so"
14230900,14233940," um"
14233940,14238820," should also change the case"
14238820,14245940," i don't know so does anyone have any other ideas for like transformation and things and whatnot"
14250100,14255860," uh base 64 but but base 64 is too difficult to implement i mean it's not that difficult to"
14255860,14260820," implement it's just you have to parcel the bits and whatnot i think i'm going to stop uh with tools"
14260820,14271940," here right we have this hex and uh we have this reverse sort um so we have to do like this line"
14272500,14279540," thinking yeah i think hex and wrote 13 should be enough uh let me check if we actually build this kind of"
14279540,14293620," stuff on on windows so this is like this uh all right this is like this um all right"
14296740,14306660," so road 13 okay so we do have road 13 xz and road 13 obg and it seems to be built okay so eventually"
14306660,14318980," we'll start using them for testing the stuff on windows as well um you could do cut that will be trivial"
14320500,14326740," probably but i want some side effects so we can see that you know things are actually piping through"
14326740,14330420," to the thing russi fire russi fire will output"
14330420,14332660," unicode"
14332660,14337700," which is not that bad of an idea to be fine but"
14337700,14348100," uh the problem is that i'm already streaming for four hours and i'm a little bit tired"
14349380,14355300," uh so i think i'm gonna call it a day boys and girls i'm gonna call it a day today we did a pretty"
14355300,14364660," good job we implemented useful piping functionality useful piping functionality for linux it's not complete"
14364660,14370420," one we don't do anything with standard error yet but i don't know what to do with it yet so because"
14370420,14376180," i don't really have a particular use case for standard error uh so and the next step is going to be"
14376180,14382180," implementing the same functionality but for windows right but before we go we'll go into that i would"
14382180,14387620," like to clean up the internals because i actually hacked all that together um i just want to be it as"
14387620,14393220," simple as implementing the same functions but for windows all right and also have some sort of like"
14393220,14398660," intermediate types and stuff like that and uh yeah it should be it should be interesting we're probably"
14398660,14404420," going to do that on on the stream as well yeah that's it for today boozing girls that's it for"
14404420,14409700," the day thanks everyone who's watching right now i really appreciate it have a good one and i see you"
14409700,14414260," all tomorrow tomorrow according to the schedule we're going to be doing a virtual machine development"
14414260,14418900," this time yeah we're going to continue developing the virtual machine and by the way the virtual machine"
14418900,14424020," is actually one of the main users of this build system i kind of developed this build system for that"
14424020,14429300," virtual machine so yeah but we're not going to build system tomorrow we're going to do a virtual machine"
14429300,14433860," uh check out our schedule for more information on different projects we're working on check out our"
14433860,14438260," what's channel where we upload our recording of the streams this stream is going to be there but on"
14438260,14444820," the next day and also check out our discord server for offline discussion with the community"
14444820,14449700," and while you're waiting for continuation of starting streams uh let's maybe rate somebody i don't know"
14449700,14458740," no one is streaming"
14458740,14469540," maybe we can find somebody uh okay let me close the uh by ladder is streaming is he streaming"
14471380,14478580," programming games and shit all right"
14478580,14489300," so let's take a look at the the science and technology section and see who's streaming right now"
14497060,14522340," game dev pro you unreal engine hmm french not english um hmm"
14527860,14540500," uh scroll scroll scroll doesn't work"
14540500,14544900," all right i've tried chess"
14544900,14552260," uh okay all right thanks everyone fortune uh love you"
14552260,14554260," You"
