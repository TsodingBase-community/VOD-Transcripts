0,7000," Can you thrill me, tell what is Alexa?"
7000,10000," Ok, let's give it a try."
10000,13000," Open up google.com"
13000,16000," Ok, let's open it up."
16000,18000," Alexa"
18000,24000," So, lexical analisis"
24000,28000," Analisis"
28000,34000," In computer science, lexical analysis"
34000,38000," is the process of converting a sequence of characters"
38000,42000," into a sequence of lexical tokens"
42000,47000," with an assigned and those identified meaning."
47000,52000," A program that performs lexical analysis may be termed lexical, whatever."
52000,58000," Ok, so we have a sequence of characters and you're converting it into a sequence of tokens."
58000,62000," And tokens is basically something that has actual meaning."
62000,68000," So, characters by themselves don't have a meaning, but the tokens do have a meaning."
68000,70000," For instance, let's take a look at the for loop."
70000,74000," Something like this."
74000,76000," What kind of tokens do you have?"
76000,77000," What kind of tokens do you have?"
77000,79000," So, we have a sequence of characters."
79000,81000," It doesn't really have any meaning."
81000,82000," But the tokens that you have."
82000,85000," The first one is a keyword for."
85000,87000," The next one is open parent."
87000,89000," The next token is integer."
89000,96000," Notice how there is no spaces between four open pair and integer."
96000,99000," But it's still three tokens."
99000,104000," What's funny is that if you remove a space between int and i,"
104000,106000," this becomes a single token."
106000,107000," Right."
107000,111000," But if you put spaces in here or remove spaces from here,"
111000,113000," it's still going to be three tokens."
113000,120000," So, this kind of separation into meaningful parts is not really white space sensitive."
120000,122000," Where here, it is white space sensitive."
122000,127000," Because it's kind of difficult to distinguish whether you mean a type or a variable."
127000,128000," Right."
128000,132000," So, in the process of analyzing what is a symbol?"
132000,133000," What is equals?"
133000,134000," What is a number?"
134000,137000," What is a semicolon or something like that?"
137000,140000," Is called lexical analysis or tokenization."
140000,142000," So, here you have a sequence of characters."
142000,144000," Here, we have a sequence of tokens."
144000,145000," Right."
145000,147000," And tokens are keyword."
147000,149000," This is a keyword."
149000,151000," Then open parent."
151000,153000," Then symbol."
153000,154000," Another symbol."
154000,155000," Right."
155000,157000," So, then equals."
157000,159000," Then number."
159000,161000," Then semicolon."
161000,166000," So, this process of taking a sequence of characters and actually grouping them and analyzing"
166000,173000," and assigning a sort of like kind to them or class to them is called lexical analysis."
173000,174000," Lexing."
174000,175000," Tokenization."
175000,176000," Whatever you want."
176000,178000," This kind of process has like different names."
178000,179000," That's what it is."
179000,181000," It's simple as that."
181000,182000," No gatekeeping."
182000,184000," No any mathematical bullshit."
184000,185000," It's as simple as that."
185000,187000," You take a sequence of characters."
187000,191080," you convert it to a sequence of tokens, a token's goof characters that have meaning."
