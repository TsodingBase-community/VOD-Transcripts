640,6640," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreation programming session with"
6640,11280," mr zozin so let's make a little bit of announcement and officially start the stream so red circle"
11280,18000," uh live on twitch and what are we doing today on twitch.at television website"
18000,24400," today we're checking out a thing called uxn right i don't know i don't really know what it is but uh"
24400,29520," this is something that been on my to-do list for quite some time because people talked about it so"
29520,32720," that's what we're going to be checking out today i'm going to give the link to where we're doing all"
32720,37040," that which.tv/studying and i'm going to ping everyone who's interested in being pinged and there we go this"
37040,43440," stream has officially started the stream has officially studied so today we're checking out uh"
43440,52400," the uxn uh var vara ecosystem um for like a personal computer thing so uh yeah it's a personal computing"
52400,58320," stack based on a small virtual machine that lies at the heart of our software and that allows us to run"
58320,63680," the same application on a variety of systems so somebody suggested this to check this thing out"
63680,69680," quite some time ago and then after that uh several people as well mentioned this thing so it must be"
69680,75440," something interesting uh i'm going to leave the link here in the chat and of course for people on"
75440,79200," youtube i'm going to put it in the description so i think i forgot to prepare the description so let me"
79200,89600," quickly do that uh uxn and a uxn so it's a small virtual machine right so it's quite quite interesting"
89600,95440," uh it's designed with implementation first mindset uh so the link goes into some sort of like a"
95440,101840," article or whatnot uh it is tailored to a specific need for hosting graphical applications but it's entirely"
101840,109600," open and welcome anyone to adapt as a release target uxn is programmable in its own unique language uh right"
109600,118080," uxn tall uh so what's that tall is a programming language for uxn virtual machine uh uxn programs"
118080,127200," uh are written in a stack based ah i see what okay people i guess this thing was suggested around the time i was"
127200,133200," making port right so people saw me doing a like a stack based virtual machine oh you might be interested"
133200,140000," in this another thing okay okay i see i see what's going on and it's literally fourth okay okay okay okay"
140000,146560," okay i see i see it's it's it's okay that's very interesting all right all right uh so and the"
146560,155040," distribution of uxn programs is akin to sharing game roms for classical console emulators oh and that is"
155040,160960," already fucking interesting so it kind of reminds me of pico 8 i think uh so there was a thing like a"
160960,167440," pico 8 uh which is also like that but it's like a fantasy console yeah it's a fantasy console and on"
167440,174480," top of that it's actually paid software you have to buy this uh to use this thing i suppose is free and"
174480,181520," open source right so i think i even did pico 8 stream i think i even still have a license since the"
181520,186000," times i was able to pay for this kind of so maybe we're gonna do another pico 8 stream at some point"
186000,192160," so i think i think i need to uh make a reminder to do another pico 8 stream because the the the previous"
192160,198400," one was actually kind of cool uh right so let me actually put that in here so yeah sort of like a"
198400,204800," pico 8 but in pico 8 you program in lua so essentially you're using lua virtual machine technically"
205360,212560," uh right and the roms are distributed through png files pico 8 is kind of weird in that sense right"
212560,220320," i don't do not fully understand it but it is what it is um so um so console emulator learn blah blah blah"
220320,226080," so desktop version so you have to run uxn programs you will need an emulator that works on your system"
226080,232320," below are links to emulators for major operating systems and for more obscure environments uh okay so"
232320,238800," we have a linux uh linux emulator so let me actually download it all right let's go let's go my new"
238800,244480," friend we're uh onto an adventure we're going onto an adventure so i'm going to just like w get this"
244480,251680," i hope it's not that very big so it's 101 kilobytes so let's do the unboxing right so what's the unboxing"
251680,256480," experience that was fast right so that's actually pretty fast so we have a bunch of roms"
257120,266000," uh and sims and those are binary files and i suppose these are executable files you have uxn"
266000,275280," awesome uxn uh cli uxn emulator so i suppose this is an emulator right so uxn i want to type unix right"
275280,281920," so this is the first reflex i have uh uxn emo it's actually executable right so if you take a look at the"
281920,289920," elf uh right so in terms of dependencies what does it depend on holy shit okay okay okay"
289920,297280," so it's a full-fledged sdl2 application all right all right all right all right okay so let's actually"
297280,303040," see so you're supposed to provide the rom what kind of rom can we provide in here so is there some okay so"
303040,321360," there's a calculator so there's a there's a tiny tiny little cursor in here how can i make it bigger"
321360,325840," how can i make it bigger okay what's that um"
329120,337760," so there is some sort of a sound right so there is some sort of a sound why is it constantly going"
337760,342400," uh all right"
342400,345680," it's kind of weird"
350320,359200," i i have no idea what that is but that is so bizarre that is so bizarre um"
359200,369760," so uh what are the things we uh we have in here uh so we probably have orca all right so what the"
369760,379760," what the fuck is orca what am i looking at"
379760,382080," well"
382080,384800," uh"
384800,394640," so there's menus and shits what the fuck is this what the fuck how do i write shit for this"
396240,403920," uh is this some sort of a game uh this might be a game um so"
403920,408880," cat clock so there's a cat clock"
408880,410080," uh"
410080,416080," yo look at that look at that"
416080,423760," can your stinky javascript with react do that i don't fucking think so"
424560,427040," eat that react people eat that"
427040,438240," um so yeah that's pretty cool um how can we okay so that's cool you have virtual machine you have roms"
438240,443520," how can i write for this thing so this this is the really interesting question so"
443520,450720," oh it comes from the this is a windows xp isn't it so it's an old project"
451600,455040," so it's a straight up old project from like windows xp times"
455040,465680," what the fuck what an actual fuck all right so uxian guide uh the same uxian room can be used on"
465680,469520," variety of desktop computers on tiny this is actually a pretty cool idea honestly"
470400,475840," this is actually a pretty cool idea right so you have like a small virtual machine and you can distribute"
475840,480960," i mean it's a basically like jvm at that point but it's a sort of like a recreational machine"
480960,487760," and do i understand correctly that they oh my god so they have like a headway implementations of this thing"
487760,495680," don't they uxian can also run on classic consoles and on all electronics okay currently there are ports uh not all are complete"
496240,504160," so but so the the emulator is small enough to run on like old consoles and that is very interesting"
504160,510000," actually that is very interesting but is it possible to like make an actual hardware of that virtual machine"
510000,517520," so right the thing about pico 8 is that it's a fantasy console but you can't really implement like a"
517520,521680," hardware version of this thing right because it's a pretty complex thing by itself"
522320,530000," um right maybe uxian is such a small simple machine that you can literally implement it on hardware"
530000,534320," without emulator but i don't really know so maybe i just need to read some documentation and stuff"
534320,542960," um so doublet the microcontrollers they least don't include fpga chips oh okay so that's that's very"
542960,546720," interesting so you already you guys are already looking into this thing right you're already looking"
546720,554640," into this thing i'm interested in like a programming part of this stuff uh uxian guide so uxian guide our"
554640,561040," general purpose so this is how you build this thing maybe we should look into the programming language"
561040,568240," right so there's some sort of a book uh right some sort of a book uh you can see a stack-based flavor"
569120,575280," of assembly designed specifically for this virtual machine tal files are human readable source files"
575280,581360," rom files are uxian compatible binary program files applications that transform tile files into rom files"
581360,589200," are called assemblers uh sounds logical to me um so to get started equip yourself with an emulator and"
589200,595600," assembler for your system okay we already have an assembly don't we so there's a uxian awesome uh right"
595600,601200," so there's uxian awesome and there we go so okay okay this is pretty straightforward this is pretty"
601200,610560," straightforward so maybe we can create input towel uh is there like a towel module uh mod uh for emacs melpa"
610560,620880," so emac style mod um emac style mode there is a town mode apparently okay so tell mode provides emac style"
620880,628080," translation portable is that the thing trans transactional application language i don't"
628080,633520," think that's what it is maybe we don't really need that right so maybe we don't really need that because"
633520,641120," it's like a very simple it's just like a sequences of words i suppose um okay unic style uh syntax in a"
641120,647920," concatenative programming okay so they even list uh links to concatenative.org right by the way did you"
647920,653600," guys know that somebody edit ports to concatenative.org the website of concatenative languages right so"
653600,664720," somebody actually edit port and ports is a dead language so oh my god stack-based concatenative"
664720,668240," strongly type compile programming language that the self-hosted ports is developed by"
668240,673840," it's it's it makes it sounds like i'm some sort of like a famous software development it's it's the that"
673840,680240," famous creator of that pro yes yes yes like you give me too much freaking credit i mean"
680240,692640," uh okay anyways i'm just a poster on the internet okay i'm just a poster on the internet so you've been"
692640,699440," too official um all right so in concatenative language there's no precedence rules the uh the"
699440,704640," calculations are merely performed in the sequence in which they are preserved the order we with which"
704640,710160," elements come off uh a stack is known as the last in first out okay so we are aware of that i've been"
710160,715440," programming for almost 20 years thank you so much uh okay so i suppose we're pushing some numbers we're"
715440,719520," duplicating them we're adding them together and we're multiplying by three so essentially"
720160,725200," the result of this thing is going to be six and they even indicate that in here so the result actually"
725200,732480," is six i don't really know why the prefix numbers with this sort of thing right so i don't really know"
732480,740240," so is that like a based stuff the question is how do you print text okay so there is a print text"
740240,746720," example program the first line of the programming example begins the absolute padding talking"
747680,754400," the uh absolute padding talking so it's like an absolute unit of a token it's an absolute patent"
754400,761760," all right so i have no idea what it is so there's something called absolute padding talking which is a bar"
761760,766560," uh 10 uh which moves the program writing locations"
766560,776640," oh okay so it's like it it has like a head it has like a head you can move that head to different addresses"
776640,786640," and allow us to define labels and sub labels for the various parts of the console device so that we"
786640,797440," we can reference them in our code by name yo so console device all right all right all right so we're moving"
797440,805920," the cursor at that specific address we're creating a bunch of tokens so this is the label so i suppose"
805920,814560," thing that starts with at is a label things that starts with ampersand is a sub label so i suppose this thing"
814560,823120," console is in fact a label then we have a bunch of sub labels that are ampersands and what are the dollars i have no idea"
824240,832320," but okay so then i suppose this thing moves to this specific address and we're"
832320,839760," just doing hello world print f i have no idea what the is that uh so then"
839760,845840," print text so we're calling print text and print text is defined somewhere here"
846720,856560," uh huh so this reminds me of fourth actually this reminds me of fourth because in fourth uh there"
856560,865040," is this convention for defining words uh if you google up fourth uh define define new word"
866160,877440," uh it is very much uh it is very much inspired by fourth i can see that uh i can definitely see that fourth"
880000,892320," thank you doc doc go i i really appreciate for defining the word fourth uh i really appreciate that thank you so much"
892320,906160," uh fourth programming uh"
906160,915440," uh so yeah there we go so this is how we do that and essentially right so you do that with the colon you"
915440,920880," say the name of this thing and then you have this convention where on the left side of dash dash you"
920880,928240," have the inputs for the for the function for the word on the right side of dash dash you have the outputs"
928240,934560," and i kind of inherited that convention in ports as well as well if you guys remember uh if you guys"
934560,940400," remember i can inherited that convention from port and for instance here constant as you can see it accepts n"
940960,947200," it accepts n but it doesn't return anything it just consumes the n and i presume this is a similar"
947200,953680," convention this is a similar convention you have something called print text which starts with at"
953680,962240," which probably means it's a label it accepts string and doesn't return anything and then it creates a"
962240,967840," okay so it defines a label while it defines a label while then"
969120,975360," does something probably prints something on the console right then jumps back to the while right"
975360,982400," so it basically references while back uh by the way i i don't know what any of this means"
982400,988400," like at all but that doesn't matter that's kind of the point right so i'm using my brain as a sort of"
988400,995200," pattern recognition uh right so i'm just trying to see the patterns and find connections between them"
995200,1001520," right so they said that they add our labels so i define a new word at uh here and i call it print"
1001520,1008720," text so here is the loop uh so this is sort of like a sub label and here i'm sort of like jumping"
1008720,1014160," to to that sub label if that makes any freaking sense uh so and then at some point i just do hello"
1014160,1021200," world right so this is a lot of text for a simple hello world honestly for my liking if it was"
1021200,1029600," if it's a simple like a virtual machine i think a hello world should have been a smaller and simpler"
1029600,1037200," thing right it's kind of like throws too many new concepts at you right away and it's not particularly"
1037200,1041280," great when you're like learning things right i suppose it's sort of like a learning environment but"
1041280,1047760," maybe it's not for learning maybe it's actually legit like a target platform for something uh right so"
1047760,1051760," but if it was for learning i think it should have been like the first experience the hello world"
1051760,1059040," should have been simpler in my opinion so they throw at you right away a notion of console device"
1059040,1066400," right so what the is a console device uh console device uh something located the console vector is"
1066400,1076800," evaluated when the byte is received um so port holds one of five uh known types no q stdin argument argument"
1076800,1086480," argument spacer uh okay so yeah they throw a lot of stuff at you right that's a cute drawing actually"
1086480,1096160," what the i didn't expect that what the is going on it's just like i i'm looking at it like a very dry"
1096160,1101600," technical technical documentation and all of a sudden just like a drawing of q of cute character or"
1101600,1106080," something like that what the fuck"
1106080,1114240," all right so maybe i should not overthinking uh overthinking it uh so let's just go uh go ahead"
1114240,1121440," and copy paste this thing and put it in here and i suppose we can just do uxian asm and i can just"
1121440,1130560," like try to compile it and i suppose to provide the output rom right uh assembled output rom in 31 bytes"
1130560,1139600," right nine labels zero macros it has macros so we have nine labels and the question is what are the labels are"
1139600,1150880," these labels one two three four five six um right so i didn't really like this thing um so it has right"
1150880,1161840," does it have while right while is only defined in here so there is six seven eight uh so what counts as"
1161840,1171760," the label actually what counts as a label so you're one uh two three so there's three of them but then"
1171760,1181040," we have also these things uh three four five six seven eight nine oh okay so label is also a sub label"
1181040,1187920," right so there is exactly nine of them uh right so including sub labels too so that checks out"
1187920,1197040," that actually checks out okay so and that uh created the output rom it also created some sort of symbols"
1197040,1204080," right which should okay so uh it's for labels and different console devices and stuff like that right"
1204080,1210480," so and the rom itself is actually very simple it also stores its own data right as you can see so here is"
1210480,1217760," the hello world it also baked that hello world into uh into this thing so where is hello world that we have in"
1217760,1226160," here okay so here it is so it is like assembly actually it is like assembly we define it a label and here we"
1226160,1233920," literally literally just put the data but it's the weirdest way to define data honestly like what the"
1233920,1246640," fuck is going on so 20 so i suppose how many characters you have five characters in here you have uh six"
1246640,1254720," characters in here so i'm suspecting that you literally using slots of the stack as"
1256160,1262640," like a storage and then that is so bizarre and you say that okay so these characters are going to be"
1262640,1273760," part of a single slot a single number like a number uh so that is very much bizarre this is very much"
1273760,1278160," this is such an interesting and fascinating language like i have no idea what am i looking at"
1278160,1286800," uh but we created uh but we created a rom so if i do uxn uh emu and then just do output rom"
1286800,1296880," it just did hello world but on the standard output and did nothing on a screen i suppose to do something"
1296880,1304560," on the screen you have to write into specific device you have to write to a specific device"
1306480,1313120," that is such a bizarre and fascinating thing like what the"
1313120,1320320," it's just like um it's like i don't i don't understand what the it all is"
1320320,1328000," but it's really fascinating um all right so let's continue reading um so the second segment moves the"
1328000,1335680," program location to the okay they actually explain what the is going on in here holy um so let me see"
1336480,1344000," one more time uh so this 10 thing move the program writing location to the address this and allows"
1344000,1350160," us to define labels and sub labels for various ports on the console device so that we can reference them"
1350160,1359040," in output code okay so this is where a console device starts right and we are defining um console so this is"
1359040,1368560," where we have a console and then sub labels vector uh right is one of the sub labels right so you see"
1368560,1375840," we defined label console then we defined sub label right so it's a sub label for console"
1375840,1381680," and then when we reference into this thing we are referencing to it as dot console slash right"
1381680,1388560," so that's sort of this is basically the relation between them so console and sub label right i still"
1388560,1393360," don't quite understand what are the dollars all right so what do they have to do with anything are"
1393360,1399440," they just the data or something like i still don't know but i think we're getting closer to understanding"
1399440,1404560," what the fuck is going on generally i think i think that's what is going on all right so the second"
1404560,1410560," segment moves the program location to the address 100 which is where the first page of memory ends so"
1410560,1417840," there are pages of memory and they're sort of like uh uh this size if you take a look at the hexadecimal so"
1417840,1424480," 128 24 is that what it no 256 right i don't really know hex i'm really sorry uh i don't really know hex"
1424480,1430240," so which is very the first page so the pages are 256 bytes essentially maybe maybe not even bytes but"
1430240,1435840," maybe some sort of like words uh i don't know so is there a description of the of the virtual machine"
1435840,1443840," itself so maybe there is somewhere but i jumped into into the language guide maybe i should have actually"
1443840,1452240," jumped into the into the virtual machine so there is a small a small virtual machine oh okay okay wait"
1456960,1464880," is that the entirety of the virtual machine the fuck oh i mean okay"
1464880,1474080," i suppose the the main difficulty for the emulator is to wire up different devices and everything right"
1474080,1479680," so because this thing probably doesn't wire up different devices right it's just like a simple virtual"
1479680,1491120," machine right um anyway so console device uh so to learn more use c uxc and tal structs right so these are"
1491120,1500400," the structures using the uh and defining data structures in uxc and tal enumerations are labels with unique"
1500400,1506480," values that can be used as constants in a program they begin by rolling back to the program address with zero"
1507040,1517680," okay so that's pretty cool so i suppose this parentheses are uh comments right so these"
1517680,1525120," parentheses are comments uh the similar to to fourth right so we're moving here so we define the"
1525120,1532880," structure suit and these are the fields clubs diamonds hearts and spades and then the usage so there's this"
1532880,1543200," thing structs define padded labels for example this uh person age label holds a value of two using the offset"
1543200,1551120," allows to access pizza okay right so you define a structure person with the name that is has value to the"
1551120,1561120," age a value one and height two uh right so and then you have members and this is like a dictionary and stuff like"
1561120,1566720," that so there's some constants pro t playbooking okay so that doesn't tell me anything okay let's moving"
1566720,1574880," on uh so let me see the second segment moves the program location to the address this which is where"
1574880,1583040," the first page of memory ends and where all uxm programs begins okay so we'll uh so there is a memory"
1583040,1589520," there are 64 kilobytes addressable memory roms are loaded at okay which is the address of the reset vector"
1590320,1597120," once in every uxm program can write over itself it is not uncommon for uxm program to store values in its"
1597120,1613120," own runtime memory is big ending when writing or reading a short for a short for memory the position is that"
1613120,1619920," of the high byte of the low byte of short bytes blah blah blah all right so let me see"
1620640,1627600," so next is a comment the arrow symbol indicates that the following operator is a vector and will terminate"
1627600,1636160," with the break to learn more uh look uxn notation okay so that's actually very cool uh using stack effect"
1636160,1645600," definitions uh maybe this is what i should have started with right so okay so this is a spacer"
1646320,1655360," so they say that this thing is a vector right and it uh terminates with uh terminates with the break and"
1655360,1664320," then it just does hello world and what is hello world hello world is uh-huh it's that label and then you"
1664320,1672880," call to the print text and print text is separate so they specifically split the implementation of hello"
1672880,1680000," world into two parts into two parts to probably demonstrate how this entire shit works but i don't"
1680000,1688800," really know if that's super necessary so i suppose jump to r it's is jump to return so the question i have"
1688800,1695120," so first thing um to sort of like a demonstrate an understanding of what the fuck is going on"
1695120,1701840," can i inline print text if i just do the following thing"
1703840,1715120," like this will this entire shit work will this entire shit work so it feels a little bit unnecessary"
1715120,1721440," to have like a separate function to just print hello world right if i understand this entire thing"
1721440,1726800," correctly that should just work so this is where the program starts this is some sort of a comment right"
1726800,1734400," sort of convention we're pushing the pointer to hello world data in here right and then we're sort of"
1734400,1740640," iterating doing some mamba jamba i still do not fully understand that the result of this mamba jamba is"
1740640,1747280," probably two things on the stack so we're just popping them uh from the stack and then we're breaking"
1747280,1753120," effectively terminating the execution of the program i suppose that's basically what is going on"
1753120,1758640," we can try to build this entire thing it does in fact build we reduced the amount of labels to eight"
1758640,1764880," remember we had uh nine of them now we have eight and i wonder if it's still going to work if it's"
1764880,1771280," still going to twerk it's still working it's still twerking they over complicated hello world why the"
1771280,1778400," do they show you a bloat why the hello world is so goddamn freaking bloated when you're learning things"
1778400,1787040," i'm disappointed this is supposed to be a hello world that just demonstrate like a very simple thing"
1787040,1793520," like why are you throwing people into separate functions and bruv come on i'm pretty sure you"
1793520,1802480," can simplify this even further you can who wrote this java developers are you java developers by the way i'm"
1802480,1808960," joking but to be fair there's a fair bit of criticism in what i'm saying right even though i'm being ironic"
1808960,1815840," but there is a fair bit of criticism right so this is supposed to be hello world so why are you needlessly"
1815840,1823040," over complicating it why are you needlessly over complicating it like why separate function i know"
1823040,1828720," that you want to show off different features but the first experience must be here is the simplest"
1828720,1837120," possible thing that just works let's start from here do not over complicate do not over complicate please"
1837120,1842560," i fucking beg you at least the first experience the first experience must not be that complicated"
1842560,1851680," anyways okay uh so um"
1853280,1859760," so the common the the arrow indicates that operation is a vector whatever the fact that means"
1859760,1869760," uh so whatever the the fact that means vectors um uxn is non-interruptible vectors are locations in"
1869760,1877680," the program that are evaluated when certain event occurs a vector is evaluated until break up code is"
1877680,1885920," encountered uxn can communicate with a maximum of 16 devices each device has 16 ports each port handles a"
1885920,1892560," specific i o message ports are mapped to the device's memory page which is located outside of the main main"
1892560,1904640," addressable memory um okay so i suppose it's like an interrupt vectors in x86 right so and entry point"
1904640,1914480," is one of the vectors right an entry point is one of the vectors and event that it handles is started the"
1914480,1926400," program i guess makes sense makes sense to me i guess oh boy uh so if i if parentheses are comments that"
1926400,1934640," means i can straight up ignore this which is good which is good okay uh so the hello world token pushes"
1934640,1943120," the absolute of an address right absolute address made of two bytes onto the stack so they're operating on"
1943120,1948880," two bytes usually this is what i noticed right so they are basically operating on two bytes"
1950080,1957600," so um which is kind of interesting so they're operating on two bytes uh and maybe the entire"
1957600,1961760," memory is also addressable in two bytes so how much you can address in two bytes i don't quite remember"
1961760,1968880," so yeah that's that's basically like 6502 isn't it i think i think that's basically 6502 but i never"
1968880,1977760," actually programmed 6502 yo that sounds like a cool idea for a stream 6502 6502 assembly stream uh so it pushes an"
1977760,1983360," absolute address made of two bytes onto the stack and uh and which points to a series of characters in"
1983360,1992000," memory a hexadecimal number or a label pushed uh to the stack in this fashion is called literal as"
1992000,2002720," opposite to a value stored in memory okay so yeah so you have just a pointer and you have the data separately"
2002720,2009840," right so essentially here you're pushing an address to this data but the data stays in memory but you have"
2009840,2016880," an address on the stack on the operand stack um right so that makes sense to me so then they call that literal"
2017600,2026480," next we call the print text routine okay both ampersand while and at while are ways to define"
2026480,2033520," labels but using the ampersand rune will prefix our new label with the name of the last parent label"
2033520,2042240," creating print text while so the basically relationship between labels here is similar to"
2043360,2053840," sub labels in many x86 64 assemblies that i programmed in right so quite often uh right in x86 64 assembly you"
2053840,2060320," can define a label which is for example main right and you can do different things in here so move racks 69"
2060320,2069760," move rbx 420 uh and then you probably want to do something in a loop and you can define dot loop in here"
2069760,2076800," you can do some things in here and then you can jump into dot loop so the cool thing about these sub labels"
2076800,2085440," is that they're always prefixed with the main label that starts before them which creates sort of a namespace"
2085440,2093040," so then in the next function foo you can reuse the same label again and they're not going to collide you know"
2093040,2099200," why because they're prefixed with the corresponding main label in here so technically they're different labels"
2099200,2107840," so i suppose this is the same sort of energy this is the same sort of vibe this is the same sort of idea"
2107840,2114880," you have main labels and you have sub labels which are automatically prefixed with the name of the main label"
2114880,2122400," and this is how we got the console slash right right so here we have some sort of a structure uh here are"
2122400,2128800," sub labels they have the these sort of values in there uh they have some sort of this is"
2128800,2132640," wait a freaking second"
2135680,2144080," so if i'm doing a right so here's the interesting thing i do not use read i do not use pad i do not"
2144080,2152560," use error and when i'm referring to this thing i'm basically pushing a value a value of one is that what"
2152560,2159760," i'm chat chat do i understand correctly that i can nuke this entire and just"
2159760,2170080," replace this thing with one and it's still going to work do i who please please don't please don't"
2170080,2174240," tell me that this is the the the case i'm gonna be mad"
2174240,2182800," all right so the chat tells me that i can't do that but we can check that by the way uh we can check"
2182800,2188240," that so first of all let me see if i can command this thing out uh let me try to command this thing out"
2188240,2194880," and uh just try to uh to do the following thing okay so unknown zero page reference a console right"
2194880,2204880," and it doesn't even tell you where it happened"
2204880,2217600," maybe eight so people say so there's it doesn't tell you where the error happened so it happened here"
2217600,2223600," right so i'm reference to this thing but they don't say the line or anything or whatever"
2223600,2233440," i'm i'm i'm disappointed i'm genuinely disappointed right it doesn't have to be a super complicated"
2233440,2240880," reporting system just tell me at least the line uh it's not that hard you so you probably know that"
2240880,2248480," information um you you probably do know that information anyways so and i can probably comment"
2248480,2254480," out this thing and um i suppose this supposed to be right so i'm gonna put it like this"
2254480,2262560," right so it assembled and now we simplify this entire thing to two labels right we simplified it to two"
2262560,2270000," labels uh let me see if i can now uh run this in that no it's not good okay okay chat was right chat was"
2270000,2276720," right apparently i can't just do that so it has to be so the i just don't understand what exactly this"
2276720,2285200," entire thing means but i wonder if um if i can maybe can i just get rid of"
2285200,2293440," everything except right so there is also padding um all right so probably won't be able to do this"
2293440,2298480," kind of thing so let me uh let me try out okay so if you want to have a comment it has to be like a"
2298480,2305920," separate token yeah so and if i try now now to run now all right all right all right so that means"
2305920,2312480," we're not there yet we're not there yet uh so let me try to do that and uh yeah"
2312480,2320880," wait a second why did it stop working at all it stopped it stopped working completely"
2323360,2331360," i think i did the fuck you lucky i think i did a little bit of a fucky bucky uh oh yeah remove remove"
2331360,2338320," uh one yeah yeah that's that's right so that means uh i need to repeat that experiment yet again yeah i"
2338320,2346160," need to repeat that experiment yet again where uh i want to try to do that so a little bit of a"
2346160,2353120," highlighting would have be appreciated but i don't know i don't want to spend too much time"
2353360,2365760," uh yeah okay but if i try to do that uh and then output okay so this is very important by the way"
2365760,2372240," this is very important it is very important to mess with the code and see what works what breaks and"
2372240,2379760," what not because this is how you gain understanding right so i'm not failing at doing something and well"
2379760,2386640," i mean technically i do but i'm exploring right i'm testing the hypothesis okay the hypothesis was wrong"
2386640,2392640," so i'm going to continue just reading and see if i gain more understanding all right so we figured out"
2392640,2398640," that the at while and ampersand while are just you know labels and sub labels sub labels and stuff like"
2398640,2407760," that next the duck of code copies the absolute of an address on a stack and loads the byte in the memory"
2407760,2418720," found at that address um copies the absolute address on the stack and loads a single byte in memory found at"
2418720,2432800," that address to top of the stack so what do you mean copies so it basically consumes okay load a k so l d a k"
2432800,2442560," load a k uh all right that's cool so we start here aha we put address of hello world onto the stack so this is"
2442560,2450960," just a label we can ignore that we load whatever the byte at that specific address we writing that byte and"
2450960,2461200," then we deal that beer we deal that beer so and that value is sent to device port with dow so i suppose so here you"
2461200,2468960," have a byte that you read from there you have a byte that you read from there then you push the value"
2468960,2477440," right so the device port 18 aha i remember chat was saying something about 18"
2477440,2486240," i remember the chat was saying something about 18. so that means i can replace this thing"
2487680,2493680," with 18 with 18. chat do i understand correctly that that is going to work"
2493680,2500000," right is that what you're saying chat i remember you were saying something"
2502000,2509040," freaking why did you over remove all of that shit freaking remove all of that shit creators people who"
2509040,2514080," documented the remove all of that crap remove all of that crap"
2514080,2524000," two two things two remarks report the lines where the errors happen very important"
2525040,2532960," simplify hello world it's the first goddamn experience do not overcomplicate it do not freaking overcomplicate"
2532960,2541520," anyway so i should probably not remove the comments because maybe they're going to be useful right so"
2541520,2543680," maybe we're going to be using and using them but anyway"
2545040,2554080," um which you expect from windows xp users i mean i expect things to be simpler because windows xp was"
2554080,2558320," a simple operating system actually windows xp is one of my favorite operating system of all time"
2558320,2564640," i like it better than linux man i wish we could back to windows xp times it was a perfect operating"
2564640,2572640," system why the did they discontinued it you know what you know what so as far as i know as far as i know"
2572640,2578880," there is a lot of like a government entities still use windows xp and there's quite a few people who"
2578880,2586240," would like to still use windows xp microsoft open source that shit seriously open source windows xp"
2586240,2590000," we're going to continue like supporting it and updating it and everything it's just like"
2590880,2594320," just give it to the community i mean it's an old operating system like but come on"
2594320,2603760," why not just do that i know why they're not going to do that because everyone's going to ditch their"
2603760,2608880," fucking operating system windows 11 windows 10 and other operating systems that's why"
2608880,2615280," everyone is just like oh i'm going back to windows xp that"
2620880,2628240," um anyways so i wonder how did we come to the if it's a port 18 so"
2628240,2637760," uh-huh man i still don't understand this like dollars that's why hello world must be simpler"
2637760,2642000," you're throwing too much shit at the user you're throwing too much but maybe that's you go"
2642880,2649520," maybe that's a go maybe you are a gatekeeper like that right so you're trying to weed out like a"
2649520,2654640," script cases and stuff like that so okay i see what you're doing i see what you're doing creators i"
2654640,2662240," see what you're doing the gatekeeping and um uh that will be set to the device port 18 with the deal"
2662240,2668720," all right all right all right all right all right which is a good thing a healthy dose of uh gatekeeping"
2668720,2674320," is not a bad thing honestly okay so here oh okay i see the console device it starts at 10"
2674320,2680160," right so you have read um so you have a vector"
2680160,2692400," is that the width that might be a width actually right so you have a vector and they say the width is 2"
2695360,2702560," the shit just clicked in my head i understand it this is the width of that field isn't it"
2702560,2709440," it's the width of that field right so vector is 2 okay so this is the two things then read is 1"
2709440,2718400," pad 5 which means we skip five of them one two three four five next is right"
2722720,2727840," i know kung fu what the i just understood it okay that's cool"
2727840,2740240," so it it's the width it's the size of the field right so all right and okay so the actual value is"
2740240,2747120," indicated with the hashes right the actual value is indicated with the hashes but this one indicates"
2747120,2752160," sort of size of the field maybe something like that but i kind of vaguely understand what the"
2752160,2761760," is going on so yeah essentially we move the sort of address in here and we say that at that specific"
2761760,2769120," address we have that structure with this layout but we don't really have to use that structure"
2770000,2778560," we can just directly say address here but for the convenience of the user we can okay okay i see what's"
2778560,2785920," going on not bad actually i kind of like that i kind of like that all right all right all right"
2788160,2792640," so i suppose like after that um the um"
2792640,2806000," the data is completely consumed right so if this thing consumes the pointer uh and reads the bytes"
2806000,2811840," so that means on the stack okay okay so let's actually take a look at the state of the stack you"
2811840,2820160," have hello world uh load world ldak consumes this entire thing and replace it with a single like"
2820160,2828960," h byte then we push 18 in here uh then we deal with that big basically sending that by there so we have"
2828960,2838400," nothing um so that means ldak does not consume the address it does not consume the address as the"
2838400,2845120," documentation says as the documentation says it copies yeah it copies absolute address on the stack"
2845120,2851440," okay so that's the thing it does it does the following thing that then reads the byte out of"
2851440,2857840," that address then we push 18 and then with deal we're sending it to the output device and we're ended up"
2857840,2865440," with this thing okay makes perfect sense so then we increment two i have no idea what the"
2865440,2872400," fuck is that why we do increment two i would expect this thing to increment one uh but then we increment"
2872400,2878800," two and why we load ak again so that doesn't make any sense so let's actually read uh this thing we"
2878800,2883280," increment the absolute address found at the top of the stack with increment two because the address is"
2883280,2888240," is made of two bytes we low"
2888240,2890240," what"
2890240,2890480," what"
2890480,2901680," that's that's a very interesting justification of using ink too but"
2904240,2908800," we increment we increment the absolute address found at the top of the stack with ink too because the"
2908800,2910480," address is made of two bytes"
2910480,2921520," all right we load the incremented while you next uh value next we do a conditional immediate jump with this"
2921520,2928160," for as long as the item on the stack is not zero we use pop two to remove the address on the stack and"
2928160,2930720," keep the stack clean at the end of the subroutine"
2930720,2937840," that doesn't make any sense what the"
2937840,2947360," just a second uh mine"
2947360,2955680," so ink uh operates on the byte ink too operates in the shot okay so that makes sense so essentially if i just do"
2955680,2965040," ink i won't be able to address more more than 256 right so if like lower bytes overflows so the upper"
2965040,2973040," bytes is not going to be updated is that the key i suppose um right so that's very fun okay"
2973040,2982080," um so we increment the uh the address we increment the address why the are we loading anything in here"
2982960,2992320," um so ah ah i see so this is a conditional jump"
2992320,3002320," this is a conditional jump because at the end of the string we have zero freaking new terminated strings"
3002320,3009360," mother flipper new terminated strings uh right so essentially we increment we load whatever we have in"
3009360,3018000," there and with a question mark right so we only jump in when it's not zero makes sense to me and afterwards"
3018000,3024640," we do pop two because it's two bytes um so we use pop two to remove address in the stack and keep the stack"
3024640,3026640," clean at the end of the subroutine so"
3031040,3037920," i really like how you like it's so funny you're reading like a dry documentation and all of a sudden"
3037920,3040480," just like a cute drawing of a cute character just pops up"
3043440,3054000," this is so cool what is this project who made this who freaking this is amazing what the and you know"
3054000,3061840," this is a goat you know this is a goat because the uh the pupils are horizontal right so this is a goat"
3063520,3070240," um an artist man okay so i can understand that i also a little bit into drawing illustrations uh"
3070240,3076160," right i wouldn't call myself an artist right but i do like to draw illustrations and for instance in on"
3076160,3082080," twitch uh there are panels at the bottom i draw them all myself right if you're interested to"
3082080,3087920," to know what kind of art i can create uh so i made it myself so i can appreciate this kind of thing"
3088880,3095920," this is super cool this is super cool i really like that um so far so far project gets"
3095920,3103520," nine out of ten nine out of ten right it's really nerdy i i really love it uh i really love it"
3103520,3110640," um there's a heavy plan nine influence as well yeah i can feel that"
3110640,3117040," it it really gives off this plan nine vibes which is super cool and i haven't checked plan nine"
3117040,3122320," unfortunately so one of the things that are on my to-do list maybe i'm gonna check check it at some"
3122320,3130240," point uh but yeah so pop two i suppose pop two is because it's a two bytes so that means"
3130240,3145280," oh that means just a single pop pops one byte and another byte stays on this so the elements on the"
3145280,3156400," argument stack they kind of have a regular size is that what's going on so essentially like you can have"
3156400,3164160," one byte elements but you have operations that treat two bytes on the stack as a single thing and operate"
3164160,3171040," as a single this is okay that's very interesting i should take a note of that for for for desire for the"
3171040,3176160," designs of my virtual machines because i never thought that you can do that that's a very good"
3176160,3182080," idea actually that's a very good idea okay okay okay i can claim that if we understand this example"
3182080,3189040," i i fully understand this no no no i still don't understand what the fuck is this honestly"
3189040,3199200," so i suppose we just push okay so this is probably uh something with the tokenization right so the tokenizer is"
3199200,3204880," probably very simple it's it's for the same reason why you can't do shit like that right for the same"
3204880,3215840," reason you can't do shit like that um so maybe something about the tokenizer maybe something about"
3215840,3221840," the tokenizer but let's actually read what is going on here uh lastly we encounter jump to r which jumps to"
3221840,3229120," the absolute address that we left on the return stack okay so we removed that thing from uh from this example"
3229120,3235760," right so we remove that thing uh so left in the stack then we enter the print text subroutine"
3235760,3246800," okay to summarize the uppercase codes are reserved words uh uppercase words uh all right all right just a"
3246800,3252720," second uh lowercase hexadecimal numbers are bytes and shirts parentheses are well"
3252720,3257680," curtis or lambdas uh"
3257680,3264960," summarize you never actually mention that anywhere and scarabards are used for organizations"
3264960,3270320," rooms are special characters at the start of the word that define its meaning here is the full list"
3270960,3284800," okay okay so this is absolute relative parent child literal hex row okay row okay i do understand what's"
3284800,3296160," going on um addressing rooms literal relative row relative okay okay okay immediate room so jump so this is just"
3296160,3303760," jump and this is conditional okay okay okay i see i see i see what's going on uh so and you have different"
3303760,3310320," stacks all programming in uxo then is done by manipulating and the working stack and return stack the classical fourth"
3310320,3317040," situation uh right i think fourth also has two stacks the the working stack and in the return stack and"
3317040,3326080," generally to be like useful entering complete you kind of need to have two stacks right so yeah that makes sense"
3326160,3339040," things so we have uh pop um so discard top item elements contains uh-huh uh-huh so"
3339040,3342960," so here are op codes"
3348960,3356640," that is very pictures my friend that is very poggers but you know what i want to do something cool"
3356640,3367120," so printing text to standard output is very cool it's very 70s i do understand that but we need to"
3367120,3375520," do something more interesting i want to do graphical i want to try to do graphical i'm"
3375520,3381840," already streaming for one hour right and i think we've got a pretty good progress in one hour we managed"
3381840,3388800," to decrypt this thing right which at first i thought is going to be impossible to do in one hour but it was"
3388800,3395280," a little bit daunting right so i think like i still hold an opinion that the creator should have not"
3395280,3402960," throw so many things at you at first and especially they should have not explained that uh you know"
3402960,3408720," parentheses are comments somewhere at the end of the chapter i think they should have taken this thing"
3408720,3416400," and put it at the top like just here are the things that you have right here's the map and here's the"
3416400,3422000," forest so you don't really put the map of the forest at the end of the forest"
3425120,3434960," no it's not how it works anyways so uh i want to make a small break and after small break i want to"
3434960,3442880," look into the graphical capabilities of this entire thing right so i presume that to draw stuff on a"
3442880,3449520," screen is going to be similar to uh working with a console it's probably some sort of like a device and"
3449520,3454960," you will just have to you know write into the ports and it will display on the memory this is my"
3454960,3461280," hypothesis we'll see how it goes all right let's make a small break and um all right so let's continue"
3461280,3468720," so we need to find how to do graphics right so we figured out how to do these kind of things so we have"
3468720,3480800," stacks we have opcodes uh right so all right that's i pretty like the drawing oh my god immediate opcodes uh"
3480800,3488000," so there is a memory uh 64 kilobytes of address of my memory that's understandable the devices are very"
3488000,3496400," interesting thing maybe we'll need to actually uh read about the devices because drawing doing graphics"
3496400,3504400," is probably one of the devices uh the display probably uh uxn is non-interruptible uh vectors"
3504400,3511040," are locations and program that are evaluated when a certain event occurs a vector is evaluated until a"
3511040,3518800," break of code is encountered uxn can communicate with the maximum of 16 oh yeah so we already read"
3518800,3526240," that uh 16 ports blah blah ports or map to devices uh begin by executing the reset vector okay so it's"
3526240,3531840," called the resect vector so basically entry point data between vectors the content of the stack are"
3531840,3537200," preserved between vectors but it is discouraged to use these stacks to pass data between vectors okay"
3537200,3550880," that's very interesting oh okay so set a vector uh mouse vector so you have data so this is the vector aha"
3550880,3561840," so in a reset vector it is your responsibility to set certain vectors on certain events oh okay okay"
3562960,3570160," so then you have a mouse okay that is so interesting but then how you do that for example adjusted in"
3570160,3577200," vector ports uh points to part of the program to be evaluated when the cursor is moved or button state"
3577200,3588560," has changed so okay so this is that uh what is right so varvara what is varvara though"
3590400,3599760," is the computer system running on uxn specification devices uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh all right all right so"
3599760,3608480," yeah we already have that i want to close some of the some of these things in here that are not uh"
3608480,3617440," really important so i suppose varvara is the is the system right the system itself so that the virtual machine"
3618080,3625600," uxcn it's kind of difficult like a specification for devices a communication with uxcn cpu is the"
3625600,3633520," computer system running on uxcn the terminology is kind of weird honestly terminology is kind of"
3633520,3640560," weird so uh let me take a look at the mouse so here is the mouse it is located in here right so"
3643280,3654320," so mouse device and then they don't really specify the vector per se right so the vector oh the vector"
3654320,3666240," itself okay is here the vector itself is here and in a reset vector in a reset vector you uh set the on"
3666240,3673920," mouse so uh and when something changes in there you want to do something so untouched the mouse button"
3673920,3684640," was pressed uh huh all right that's very cool so utilities small self-rester development tools"
3684640,3691360," is a formatter linter i suppose no it's a peephole optimizer that reveals optimization of course"
3691360,3700560," sequences and stuff like that all right so that's pretty cool uh we have mouse i suppose i'm not"
3700560,3707520," really that interested in mouse to be fair there's audio there's audio device is there a list of devices"
3707520,3717840," in some way here okay so there's not that interesting so the system device um there is a console device"
3717840,3724960," it's probably the most boring device um they should have had like a table of contents for different okay"
3724960,3740320," all right the screen vector is evaluated uh 16 times oh that is very freaking poggers okay"
3742560,3748640," that is freaking progress right so essentially there you go you can do graphics and they even provide"
3748640,3758080," you an example and you can write at 60 fps um okay um i have a question"
3758080,3761680," what the is this"
3766240,3773200," okay okay i suppose this is this is some sort of that okay okay i see this is uh"
3773200,3783520," a label right the label is located in here uh right but so that means the names of the labels may include"
3783520,3788560," the triangular brackets right because just like this triangular brackets kind of makes it"
3789120,3796960," weird right so just like what the fuck is going on um right so in that case it makes sense i suppose right"
3796960,3802640," so in that case it makes sense there's also these things which i kind of vaguely remember so there is an"
3802640,3811280," explanation of what they are i need a map uh of these things yet again so what are the commas so it was somewhere at the"
3813040,3824080," uh yeah here they are so literal relative right and this is what we see in here frame and i don't okay"
3824080,3832400," so literal relative this one is weird so there's something about the brackets that i do not fully understand"
3832400,3842080," but maybe we will figure it out maybe we'll figure it out anyway oh boy so so this is basically hello world"
3843440,3849360," uh maybe i'm going to just do something like that what's funny is that we never really do anything"
3849360,3857920," with the vector and the question is um what is the vector though the vector for the console right so"
3857920,3864080," because we never so if you want to print to the console you just print to the right but what the"
3864080,3869200," fuck is a vector all right what the fuck is a vector vector's ability when a byte is received ah"
3869840,3877520," it's for the it's for the input i see i see so if if you want to like receive something when the user"
3877520,3882720," like sends something to the standard input uh you probably set up a vector or something"
3885440,3896960," um so yeah let me go ahead and find rom and i want to remove this output rom i want to remove this"
3896960,3905040," output rom and i want to rename this thing to hello uh all right so and i would like to maybe create like"
3905040,3913600," my stuff right so this is going to be my stuff and i want to move uh this thing there right i want to"
3913600,3919760," move this thing there uh so then if i want to do an assembly i want to assemble things i'm going to be"
3919760,3927520," assembling my stuff uh hello and i'm going to be outputting that stuff my stuff hello uh rom there we go"
3927520,3933040," so and the question is does it put okay so it puts the symbols here as well which is kind of cool"
3933040,3942160," so what i'm thinking is that maybe uh maybe i could create a make file is that a good idea actually"
3942160,3950000," create a make file where i could say if i want to create a hello rom that depends on hello tal what i have to"
3950000,3961200," have to do is just you see an assembly uh right just take the tal and output rom so then i can just do make"
3961200,3971040," and it just does that uh so then i can have all uh hello rom uh so next thing we can do we can create"
3971040,3980240," graphics graphics graphics tal so this is a graphic style and i can use hello tal as sort of like an"
3980240,3988080," example where we can do things so at absolute address we start somewhere here so interestingly they don't"
3988080,3996240," show you this thing they just say that at the reset you do that but i mean this is basically the"
3996240,4002960," reset vector this is where the reset actually starts so this is probably what they mean uh right and this"
4002960,4012560," is where we sort of end and everything and uh what we do we just set the screen vector like this we just"
4012560,4018080," set the screen vector like this but this is not going to compile because we never actually specified any"
4018080,4025840," of these things uh right so we never actually specified any of these things and if we try to maybe build"
4026240,4034960," a graphics rom and then graphics rom uh depends on towel and this is basically like this so i know"
4034960,4040800," that uh make file has patterns right so i don't want to mess with them i don't remember how to use them"
4040800,4047440," so um yeah there's no on screen so what we have to do yeah so this is what we have to do we can even"
4047440,4052640," copy paste that i really appreciate that they just provided all these things that are copy pasteable"
4052640,4056480," right so i can just copy paste this thing and start using it okay so that's pretty cool"
4056480,4063120," uh right so well i mean i never defined on screen so let's go ahead and just define it so here is on"
4063120,4068640," screen uh i don't think it's going to we can say that it's also a vector right so that is actually"
4068640,4077920," technically true and then we put brk in here uh and this is where the most interesting thing starts right so"
4079040,4084240," we do the frame but we don't really have the frame so the question is what the is frame okay so"
4084240,4092960," this is the where frame is defined uh then i don't understand what the that means right so we'll have to"
4092960,4103520," ponder uh upon this stuff uh but maybe this one is uh is useful so we'll set them"
4106880,4114080," so a ports can be set to resize the screen for systems that support it oh that's very interesting so"
4114080,4123680," yeah you can actually sort of do that that is very cool that is very cool"
4127440,4136560," so what if i just don't do anything right so what if i just build it and try to uh uxn emulator"
4136560,4143280," graphics rom uh right it doesn't do anything right it doesn't really do anything but the question is"
4143280,4150000," what if we just print something on each individual frame we already know how to print things in hello"
4150880,4158800," right so that means i can get the console this is kind of cool right so you're basically like importing"
4158800,4167280," devices right so okay i'm using this device and this device simultaneously so and to do that i just sort"
4167280,4173760," of lay out the the memory like that i kind of like that that's actually super cool uh it's actually super"
4173760,4182000," cool um so and we have a console right and then uh we're gonna have hello and by the way now since"
4182000,4189520," we're a little bit more familiar with this entire thing it would be nice to have print text it would"
4189520,4195280," be unironically nice to have this function so as you can see we're slowly building up like a you know the"
4195280,4200080," library that we can reuse and everything right because now all right i want to be able to just say"
4200080,4210880," okay um so essentially hello world and then print text is that how we do that right uh yeah there we go"
4210880,4215840," so it would be nice to have some sort of like a syntax highlighting and everything but i mean that's"
4215840,4224400," that's sufficient so uh let's rebuild everything right so we don't have hello world which is a bool at its"
4224400,4229360," word wait hello world"
4229360,4240560," is that a typo this must be a typo this just must be a type what the book"
4240560,4251520," anyway uh so and again it doesn't even tell you where exactly that happens okay anyways so let's try"
4251520,4256080," try to run this entire thing and yeah so it prints hello world 60 frames per second"
4259360,4264880," it doesn't feel like 60 frames per second honestly but i i assure you it does that 60 frames per second"
4264880,4273840," not bad not bad at all it would be nice to maybe uh put like a new line so i suppose we can just put 10"
4273840,4280160," in here right so this is 10 and uh if i recompile this entire thing let's actually recompile and see how it"
4280160,4287680," goes it goes it doesn't look like a new line well what's what's the new line um so it's oh it's a"
4287680,4294720," hexadecimal god damn okay so it is hexadecimal yeah boy now it feels like 60 frames per second"
4297440,4304320," okay okay that's pretty funny uh but let's not do that uh so i'm gonna just like put the comment in"
4304320,4311680," here all right we have in progress so essentially we learned two separate things uh two separate"
4311680,4319760," things right how to print on the console and uh how to you know hook up your code into this like event"
4319760,4324800," loop of 60 frames per second and we combine them together right we combine them together so we now"
4324800,4334720," we understand uh people saying that there is like a ux okay so there is a mode for emacs uh right so"
4334720,4344640," let's actually quickly install that here it is uh so let me let me just take that let me just take that"
4347200,4353920," so i'm going to go into emacs mode and probably just install that what's going to be the best way"
4353920,4363680," for me to install that so you see n tall mode and i'm going to just do rc require and just install"
4363680,4369600," it's my own uh like sort of system for installing packages and stuff"
4369600,4376880," so it's a special macro uh that checks whether that specific package is installed"
4376880,4381520," and if it's not installed it installs it right if it's an uh if it's already installed it just like"
4381520,4388240," requires it uh and it's my custom system and i developed it before things like use package"
4388240,4393280," existed just in in case people ask why don't you just use this package people i've been using this"
4393280,4400480," shit for so long use package didn't exist seriously uh so"
4402960,4410640," and this is the explanation why i don't use uh all of these uh you know systems like a doom emacs or"
4410640,4414960," space max none of them existed when i started to use this right so"
4414960,4418800," uh none of them existed"
4423760,4432640," all right so uh can i just do uxcn uh that's much better would you look at that to be fair it's a"
4432640,4440400," little bit too colorful for my taste the fuck is this well i mean yeah it basically highlights uh each"
4440400,4446240," individual like sort of special word and everything so that kind of makes sense there's something weird"
4446240,4453920," going on with now it yeah i thought there's something weird going on with the uh with the strings and"
4453920,4459600," everything so a little orange feels a little bit old but maybe it's fine maybe we can work with that"
4459600,4469200," maybe we can work with that anyways so anyways anyways anyways anyways uh how can we so we can actually set"
4469200,4479040," this screen we can actually set the screen um when this is the output right so this is the output del is"
4479040,4490480," uh the output but we have d2 so i have no idea what is the set theme what is the setting because it's"
4490480,4500000," definitely not a thing right so uh yeah the fuck is the set theme uh because i'm pretty sure it doesn't"
4500000,4511280," really exist wait oh no it doesn't probably exist so i can actually comment out things uh if i do make"
4511280,4518240," uh right if i do make uh yeah it doesn't like why in here you're using things that don't exist"
4520640,4526000," what's wrong with people i don't freaking know uh so it's is that a label it's probably not a label but"
4526000,4529040," it's just like that is confusing as hell"
4529040,4540720," anyways um so i want to put something on this screen so i suppose to put something on the screen"
4540720,4548480," we probably have to use the pixel uh the pixel thing so paint a black pixel on"
4549200,4554960," background paint red pixel on foreground uh-huh"
4554960,4566560," so maybe we just have to go ahead and do that on each individual sort of frame because that kind of"
4566560,4578640," makes sense uh feel a red rectangle bottom left on background uh-huh all right so let's just go ahead"
4578640,4586960," and make this into i think unusually uh label on screen oh it even warns you about unused labels but"
4586960,4590400," it doesn't tell you where exactly things are if there is an error"
4590400,4599120," uh so there's hello on screen and oh this is actually quite important right so we probably want to"
4599120,4606480," set up this vector right so print yeah that that's totally fine uh okay so let's try to uh run this"
4606480,4613680," understand i think and nothing is going on i really don't see anything on the screen so nothing is"
4613680,4620960," really happening uh even though we set you know you know some things in here so nothing really works in"
4620960,4627200," okay we can try to maybe so this just sets"
4627200,4631680," i suppose this just sets the"
4631680,4640160," so port can be set to resize the screen the system support but reading from this ports should always"
4640160,4646080," return the actual size okay that's cool as a program use the for screen size position response graphics so"
4646080,4655280," here we're probably just like reading and maybe doing something so sft2 uh what is sft2 wait there was"
4655280,4662080," uh you know sft2 there was a list of all of the words uh like opcodes"
4664720,4675200," so sft2 no oh here it is so sft2 is just like a um you know shifts it's probably a shift okay"
4675200,4685360," defines the pixel or fill mode layer to draw on on option okay so this is just like a modes and"
4685360,4694000," everything okay this is just the nodes i'm still confused about set theme because it's kind of weird so it feels like maybe they want you to create like a"
4694000,4698800," a label like a set theme but then"
4698800,4702960," that's so bizarre like why did you do they do that it's just so weird"
4702960,4712400," um okay so port defines one b2 mode layer to draw on uh optional and horizontal okay so you have us"
4712400,4713840," this is"
4713840,4716560," very interesting so"
4718640,4719600," yeah set theme"
4719600,4727280," uh-huh then you so you can you can include sprites into the main thing"
4727280,4729680," so"
4729680,4731600," huh"
4731600,4736160," all right"
4736160,4743120," let me literally copy paste this so this is on reset"
4747200,4750480," so this is going to be that uh and then"
4750480,4752960," so you just do this sprite"
4752960,4756000," uh-huh and then we can"
4756000,4759600," just use this thing"
4759600,4769920," we can put it probably put somewhere okay so it does in fact highlight that so it starts to feel like"
4769920,4775120," uh what's it called temple us uh yeah temple us"
4775120,4783040," because the author implements set theme most of the time they just forgot this is so bad"
4783040,4787200," this is a really bad for documentation right just assuming these kind of things"
4787200,4791520," uh right ctrl f set theme this is just like i mean"
4793280,4800720," oh my god dude like this is really freaking bad like because this is a reference guide and that means"
4800720,4806400," you're going to be reading it out of order you're going to be reading it out of order and you don't"
4806400,4810080," you don't want to have things that are just don't make sense out of the context"
4810080,4820640," i'm this is such a cool idea i'm a little bit disappointed with the documentation"
4820640,4828320," though to be honest we haven't encountered things that are like outright super confusing it's just like"
4829760,4835840," the things could have been better let's put it this way the the things could have been better because like"
4835840,4841840," it's not like unfixable problems all of these things are very much fixable and i even explained how"
4841840,4850720," it's just like you didn't have to do it this way right um i'm still surprised there's a good yeah"
4850720,4855040," that's already a pretty good achievement honestly that that's already pretty good achievement i agree with that"
4855760,4866080," um so okay so we're setting up some things that is rough man like that is straight up rough uh okay"
4866080,4874720," so this is on screen and everything so here we're just like uh"
4874720,4881520," setting this size i suppose x and y i don't remember uh really remember what are x and y but maybe it's a"
4881520,4891040," position and whatnot and then we are doing the address and then we're just drawing the sprite and then we"
4891040,4900000," just set in the theme um and spread this in so that should just draw a sprite at a particular location"
4900000,4906880," if i understand correctly right so let's actually try to uh to build this entire thing invalid hex uh and it"
4906880,4919440," doesn't tell us where exactly it is brav brav brav brav brav brav brav brav okay okay okay so"
4919440,4922400," um"
4922400,4935200," so i suppose remove the heart are you telling me that oh so it's stored in the beads oh my god"
4935200,4941920," so it's not part of the why did you make it part of the language then why is it"
4941920,4953520," like it makes it look like this is what you have to copy paste in the code this is confusing"
4955600,4956240," like don't"
4956240,4956240," like don't"
4956240,4965360," invalid okay so writing a zero page so this is an invalid token so let me see"
4965360,4972800," why this is an invalid token so set theme uh is and"
4972800,4978720," what did i miss in here now"
4981360,4986720," how is this an invalid token can i just like not do that"
4986720,4991040," all right"
4991040,4999520," so oh this is before okay so it has to be somewhere here"
5004000,5014320," no so so so we also need to have like a system uh system r so there is a system device in here so let"
5014320,5020240," me let me find system uh so there is a system device and what does it do actually address an"
5020240,5027520," operation to allow basic memory management for roms uh and blah blah blah okay so it's actually located at"
5027520,5033680," at zero uh it's actually located at zero and nothing happens"
5033680,5039680," literally because maybe like we need to set the theme first right so that's what we have to do"
5046160,5055520," not bad not bad at all that was rough man that was rough like the documentation doesn't have to be"
5055520,5062640," this way it's just like it it's confusing on purpose but maybe i am just dumb maybe i'm just dumb anyway"
5062640,5073280," i have a feeling that it doesn't have to be like that i have a feeling that it doesn't have to be like that"
5074320,5081520," um so especially with the heart like why didn't you explicitly say that this is not part of the language"
5081520,5088320," because it makes it feel like it is part of the language dude at least put them in the in the comments"
5088320,5093920," at least put them in the comments because like man"
5093920,5098480," oh i see what they're trying to do in here but this means like"
5098480,5101040," i don't know i don't know"
5103840,5109280," okay so i said this thing is nine out of ten this is eight out of ten so i'm taking away one"
5109280,5115280," point from this thing so this is eight out of ten um so it doesn't really have to be this way"
5115280,5126320," so yeah i think i want to make actually yeah let's make another break uh so i need to process like all"
5126320,5133360," of that stuff um and after the break i want to do something interesting i want to try to make"
5133360,5139040," that hard move right so one of the things we managed to achieve in here right which is kind of cool"
5139040,5142960," we managed to copy paste things around and everything and we managed to create a heart"
5142960,5147760," can we make it like move right maybe we're going to make it like bounces of the edges or something like"
5147760,5152880," that right so this is going to be the next step so let's make a small break and then make it move um"
5160880,5167520," yeah what's up it's a me azuzin uh we're gonna be stepping that team"
5167520,5174160," while we're stepping the team and then you haven't have any questions"
5180640,5192640," so um thank you so much for our subscription with the message t sus t sus indeed sus uh sus sus so um"
5192640,5194960," what do we have"
5194960,5200960," uxn creator is in the chat oh my god really"
5206000,5213600," so modify the docs um so sad dim is clickable pointed oh thank you thank you thank you thank"
5213600,5220400," you so i really apologize if i'm being too harsh sometimes i'm just you know in the"
5220400,5229360," sort of in this mode where i sort of hyper focused and because of that i'm hyper irritated and i sometimes"
5229360,5236080," cannot control that so so far this thing is actually great i really enjoy it it's it's really freaking"
5236080,5244080," great it's really cool so uh the complaints about documentations are kind of minor i think i wouldn't"
5244080,5251040," even have them if i was not streaming right so because like there's also extra layer of streaming"
5251040,5257200," because i need to sort of learn a particular thing very very quickly right and if the condition doesn't"
5257200,5265440," really allow me to do that i it kind of becomes difficult for me so um yeah so it's pretty cool"
5265440,5271280," so uxn is really cool and i'm definitely going to be checking it again off screen for my personal"
5271280,5277920," recreational um you know needs uh and just like see what i can do with it uh but i definitely want"
5277920,5283440," to finish uh this exercise where i want to try to make the the heart move so i think it's going to be"
5283440,5288640," interesting three 256 thank you so much for zero two thank you thank you thank you um"
5288640,5301520," animation is going to be fun so i suppose the difficult part is going to be probably cleaning up"
5301520,5310320," the screen because i can quite easily just allocate two variables right for x and y and just update them on"
5310320,5317760," each individual frame and make the sprite move no big deal uh but it's probably going to leave the trail"
5317760,5325600," as it usually does so the question is going to be how can you clean the uh cleaned up that trail so i"
5325600,5334240," suppose um one of the way you can probably clean up that trail is by inverting the theme by swapping up the"
5334240,5340400," background and foreground bits and redrawing the same sprite again before drawing the next one so you're"
5340400,5347600," going to be sort of switching back and forth the theme uh so this is what i predict i don't know exactly how"
5347600,5353120," it's going to go uh but it's the most sort of like a logical thing i think that's the most logical thing"
5359840,5365920," you need to fill with the theme but you get the right idea okay because this is how it's usually"
5365920,5373280," done in old graphical systems right because in old graphical systems you can't really redraw the entire"
5373280,5379840," screen so what people usually do they sort of like patch the screen um so and imagine it's kind of the"
5379840,5387920," the same or that's an interesting idea maybe so but it requires figuring out how to what kind of opcodes"
5387920,5392880," to call and everything and i'm not familiar with all that we'll see all right"
5392880,5405760," we cut um so i suppose this is sort of like the solution um i don't know what that is but i don't"
5405760,5412400," want to spoil the solution for myself so i'm not going to click that link i'm sorry um so the thing"
5412400,5421040," is the thing is i really appreciate all the help but for me figuring things out it's kind of part of"
5421040,5428880," the fun like figuring out or figuring out things myself so um because of that i'm not going to look"
5428880,5434480," into the send links or anything that i really want to figure out things myself right otherwise like"
5434480,5442880," how do i even learn anything so uh i'm not going to look into anything i'm sorry so uh grabbing the tea"
5449440,5457840," looks like from embedded yeah that's what it looks like"
5457840,5470240," all right so um let's try to basically make the sprite move how do we put this sprite in a particular"
5470240,5479360," place so this is where we assign x and y right this is where we assign x and y so uh let me try"
5479360,5485840," to run this thing one more time uh so this is where the heart is located so and it does make sense so"
5485840,5494240," in terms of x is 20 in terms of y it's 40 so uh we can see that y is uh bigger than x right so what"
5494240,5499920," if i change this thing to like 40 40 so what is going to happen yeah and it actually moved it like"
5499920,5509040," here so this is basically where x and y is located so the next thing is how can we"
5510000,5516320," sort of allocate 16 bit variable right if i want to allocate a 16 bit variable if i create something"
5516320,5525520," like x right this is something like x um how can i say that this variable has to be well can i use a"
5525520,5535840," structure can i use a structure can i say something like uh position and then x and this is like one byte and"
5535840,5545360," why uh why another one byte like similarly to how we do that in here but like in here can i do that and"
5545360,5554000," then i can save the position in x and y i should be able to do that right shouldn't i i should be able to"
5554000,5562240," do that so and um you know we can load the position but can i load it as two bytes so there is a opcode"
5562240,5575040," uh load ak as but is there load ak too um i wonder so what kind of variance of load we have"
5575920,5588640," so there is a lda just lda and what's the difference between lda k um lda k um absolute address on the"
5588640,5597200," stack loads byte so what's the difference between lda and lda k i have a hypothesis that maybe"
5597200,5604320," um one destructive and another one is non-destructive yeah exactly so lda k is probably"
5604320,5609520," non-destructive uh and lda is destructive but if what if i want to load like two"
5610560,5618240," um two bytes because x and y is going to be like two bytes um obviously do i load them i probably load"
5618240,5626320," them separately i probably load them separately lda2 uh i couldn't find lda2"
5628480,5635200," so there is no lda2 so this is supposed to be like a language so yeah okay"
5635200,5643920," uh sometimes it's kind of difficult to find like all the necessary things it's like they're all"
5643920,5651680," like all the place and it's just like where is all that stuff uh lda2 okay and is it is it clickable"
5651680,5666400," it's not even clickable so lda2 uh-huh uh there's no way of an explanation anyway um okay so that's fine"
5666400,5676800," that's fine so we have to do lda2 um and i suppose saving is sta yeah so it's it's a store a and there's"
5676800,5683280," a store uh two uh and there's a store two k okay so the convention is clear the convention is more or"
5683280,5689040," less clear uh one of the things i want to do actually i want to take these uh coordinates right"
5689040,5697280," so first of all let me try to run this thing so that's fine um so what if i just take all of them"
5697280,5703440," so this is the value and i also need to take the address but the question is in terms of the sta"
5704320,5711600," what comes first address or the value i suppose first comes the value and only then the address"
5711600,5723840," i think so that's going to be my hypothesis uh position x and then we say uh sta2 right so then"
5723840,5730080," we're going to have 40 which is y i'm probably doing something incorrectly but that's fine uh right i just"
5730080,5737600," want to test how this entire thing work uh right so we're sort of like figuring out uh how to do these"
5737600,5746160," things and uh lda2 right first i'm saving some sort of a position in here but then i'm loading it again"
5746160,5755200," and right i'm setting the screen x and screen y then i'm doing the sprite uh like i'm basically setting the"
5755200,5761840," address like i'm sending the address of the sprite into the screen address and then i'm saying okay"
5761840,5774160," go do the sprite thing go do the sprite thing um right so the position has to be short not bite"
5775120,5787200," oh so if it's a ah i see i see i kind of vaguely okay okay so if i take a look at that map"
5787200,5798720," oh boy oh boy so literal absolute literal zero page still don't understand it but maybe it doesn't really"
5798720,5804480," matter because uh like it's kind of similar to to how you do that in here right so um"
5804480,5814720," i can't really know why it is like that but okay uh um so let's just do that um"
5814720,5820160," unknown absolute reference dot x"
5823200,5830800," uh position so this is because that this is one of the things i made okay so that kind of worked but"
5830800,5839840," then in terms of why it did in fact work in terms of why it did in fact work but in terms of exit didn't"
5839840,5849360," um so the question is why the question is why um so what if i put y in both of these cases"
5849920,5857920," yeah okay so something with x and i don't really know what exactly so probably because uh the field of"
5857920,5871360," the uh of the thing i really apologize i really apologize uh so the thing is i'm really much irritated"
5871360,5878240," by back sitting i just like i just can't stand it i'm really sorry uh so i'm really sorry"
5879440,5889840," okay so we've got that uh and okay that's cool uh that is cool so we allocated two bytes and everything"
5889840,5904080," so now uh we should be able to do all of that sort of in a loop right so we should be able to do that"
5904080,5916080," that sort of in a loop uh let me set uh the um um how is that called uh the on on screen right so let's"
5916080,5922480," actually set an on on screen vector uh let's set on screen vector uh and"
5922480,5940480," so uh let me let me see so i'm going to"
5940480,5950880," uh do it like this right so let's actually move this thing to on screen all right uh and"
5952000,5960480," now how do we set this stuff how do we set this stuff right so we're setting uh the screen vector"
5960480,5971200," we're setting the screen vector so this is a set theme uh and yeah all right so that should kind of"
5971200,5978240," kind of work right so let me see it seems to be working that is very cool so essentially we initialize the"
5978240,5986480," position at the on reset right we initialize the position on reset um and now we can try to keep"
5986480,5995280," updating it uh so first thing we can do we can load it up then we can basically maybe add one to it right"
5995280,6001360," so there is yeah we can do inc2 right we can inc2 so but here's an interesting thing we can do that"
6001360,6009760," non-destructively right so we can load it up we can increment that but we can't really store that easily"
6009760,6016640," back we can't store that easily back because when you're storing thing this has to be like the first"
6016640,6022960," address this has to be the first i wonder if you can do like a swap two is there something like a"
6022960,6029040," swap two probably not so in that case maybe i'm gonna just do it like that i know that it's probably"
6029040,6035120," not efficient i know there's probably a better way to do that some sort of special operand i'm just"
6035120,6042880," learning i'm just learning let me do a thing that at least works somehow i know that if you are"
6042880,6049040," professional you know really well this system it is annoying to watch me doing it like that i understand"
6049040,6057440," but this is how i learn things yeah it annoys some people but that's how i learn things i first"
6057440,6064560," just try to brute force and make the thing work and then i see how it can be simplified how it can be"
6064560,6071840," improved and everything right so it's probably very dumb way to do that i know that but that's how i do things"
6072880,6080960," all right so uh essentially we loaded this thing up it's destructive right and then we uh save the"
6080960,6087680," incremented thing back um so to be fair yeah and then we like loading it again which is again not"
6087680,6095520," particularly efficient uh but that is fine right so that is fine and uh nothing is really moving in here"
6095520,6103760," right so but it is drawing in certain like in a certain position right it is drawing in a certain"
6103760,6111920," position so let me maybe double check uh right is it even calling the uh on screen right now maybe i"
6111920,6119200," forgot to uh you know to set things up because i did set up the vector like i'm pretty sure i did set up the"
6119200,6125040," vectors so um they always like a cisco i think i think this is more like a cisco"
6125040,6130720," okay so hello world uh right is it"
6130720,6143840," yeah so print text uh print text and i'm gonna just try to do that invalid label uh just print text okay"
6145120,6155440," uh-huh so it only did it once which is interesting right because it did work before"
6155440,6166560," uh-huh it did work before so when i set i remember like just doing it like this"
6168320,6175520," yeah and it only like it stopped repeating on screen even though i set"
6175520,6181200," am i doing something differently this time that's kind of that's kind of interesting"
6181200,6184880," is there a font uh with all this opcode runes yeah"
6184880,6188960," um i don't know what you mean"
6188960,6193840," um so it doesn't repeat anymore that's that's weird"
6195120,6202160," that is absolutely weird so on screen oh you have to you have to okay you have to take an address"
6202160,6208320," okay okay yeah that explains it i see what's going on uh yeah there we go there we go so i figured it"
6208320,6212000," out you see no need to backseat me i can figure things out myself"
6215680,6219520," i may struggle sometimes i understand there is an urge to say"
6219520,6227600," i can figure out things myself i'm not a dummy dumb dumb well i mean i am dummy dumb dumb but i'm not that"
6227600,6233760," much of a dummy dumb dumb right i i can read i can understand things all right"
6233760,6242320," so no need to babysit me no need to backseat me i can figure out things all right that's the point"
6243040,6249200," yes that's what i'm talking about the heart is moving the heart is moving"
6249200,6259520," okay so that's cool uh let me let me think let me think so there's probably some way to maybe"
6259520,6268640," there's something maybe about this sprite thing i have a strange feeling that there's something about"
6268640,6276720," the sprite thing so let me see um so there is an address there is an address let me"
6276720,6289440," and sprite we need to find the sprite defines one bit or two bit mode layer uh draw to draw on optional"
6289440,6296080," horizontal vertical flip on the sprite and the course to use the eight by eight sprite data to draw is"
6296080,6303840," specify it by writing its location in memory okay we already kind of know that so we specified x and y"
6303840,6310880," we provided the address and we set one and like we already know how to do that so the color nibble"
6310880,6319120," defines which color is to draw for each pixel um the color nibble the color nibble um"
6321200,6323200," the following table represents"
6323200,6336800," if i understand correctly these things are bits right so this is basically eight bits we can even confirm"
6336800,6344880," that honestly we can even confirm that if i take the zero zero that's basically zero zeros and six six um"
6344880,6354480," um oh yeah there we go so there's two bits in here two bits in here and as you can see there's two bits"
6354480,6362400," in here two bits in here so that's what it is and then ff is the full thing so that means that sprite uh"
6362400,6370640," just defines this template right it just defines this templates on like where you have a i guess foreground and"
6370640,6378800," background right where you have a foreground and background uh so that means the colors are kind of"
6378800,6382240," defined by what by"
6386320,6387200," is that how"
6387200,6392800," like there's something about"
6392800,6408000," there's something about the um the mode i suppose like a bit nibble control uh so what is auto"
6411840,6419600," uh-huh so i probably need to read perfectly the colors which color on the pitch pixel represent all"
6419600,6426080," possible combinations assuming a sprite has background of zero and three concentric circles of one counting"
6426080,6435920," from this like it's a bit weird it's a bit weird so the author said that there is no need to mess with"
6435920,6445200," themes and because of that i'm looking for something that basically maybe flips the colors in here and"
6445200,6451760," that's why i don't like being backstated because i want to do things my way right so because it messes"
6451760,6457920," with my way of learning and understanding things i'm going to be messing with them so okay right even the"
6457920,6463440," author of the systems can tell me what to do if i want to be messing with them so i'm going to be messing with"
6463440,6472320," themes all right so i'm going to be messing with them uh so medium um"
6472320,6478880," uh what i want to do you know what"
6478880,6486960," can i create an anti-sprite"
6489200,6494400," can i create an anti-sprite so i'm going to go ahead and create an anti-sprite so essentially"
6494400,6498400," uh sprites uh so"
6498400,6505520," anti-sprite so we have an anti-sprite so that means this one is going to be ff"
6505520,6509760," so it's basically an inversion of those things right so it's an inversion of those things"
6510480,6516480," uh right i wonder so in in python it's kind of probably easy to do inversion"
6516480,6522320," but maybe it's going to be easier to do in c honestly maybe it's going to be easier to do in c"
6523360,6527440," anti anti anti-sprite all right so"
6527440,6536160," anti anti-sprite"
6536160,6537840," yes"
6537840,6540400," uh"
6540400,6547840," so i wonder if i can can probably do something like this a little bit of emacs magic"
6549680,6553360," boom uh and yeah that's probably it"
6553360,6559920," can your beam do that i don't freaking think so"
6559920,6562720," all right"
6562720,6570320," so um can i just have something like size t well i mean it's gonna be"
6572000,6582080," anti-sprite and then size both anti-sprite divided by size of anti-sprite zero"
6582080,6588640," so for size t"
6588640,6596720," less than anti-sprite length plus plus i we're going to be just doing print f"
6598000,6606560," u um probably something like zero two x right let's put it this way i'm gonna put the space in here"
6606560,6612800," uh anti well i mean this is actually not anti-sprite this is literally sprite right so"
6612800,6624400," anti-sprite uh sprite boom and we're computing an anti-sprite so sprite uh i uh and uh so let's actually"
6624400,6635360," build this thing so anti-sprite uh see boom so length i understand that um"
6635360,6647520," don't quite get it right so and if i run the anti-sprite um yeah that's cool the thing i wanted to do"
6647520,6648160," it's just this"
6648160,6658880," god damn it man like why all right so um"
6658880,6665440," couldn't you just freaking well i mean technically uh technically"
6665440,6670400," yeah that's good that's good so we can we can work with that uh i guess we can work with that"
6670400,6675760," um so this is the anti-sprite so there's basically an inversion of these things"
6676400,6683280," honestly i'm not sure maybe it would be maybe it would be faster to just invert bits manually i don't"
6683280,6685040," know right"
6685040,6696960," uh all right so and in here uh what we're doing what we're doing we are just"
6699040,6707280," doing that we're doing that we're just doing that then we are setting an anti-sprite so the anti-sprite"
6707280,6715360," anti-sprite and we're just do it like that so we're using the previous position we're using the previous"
6715360,6723840," position uh for the anti-sprite then we updating the position then we are reading it again right so and then we're"
6723840,6732000," setting it again so now if i try to do that that didn't work that's horrible like why"
6732000,6743200," why didn't it work okay so that's that's bizarre uh so i wonder if i just um"
6745440,6760240," so if i render wait i'm an idiot why couldn't i do the dumbest ever which is just zero zero zero zero"
6760240,6764720," this is because i'm probably a little bit tired already so uh"
6767600,6773280," so this is the end yeah yeah so why did i have to do that that's so dumb uh bravo there we go"
6773280,6780640," that's the sorting way of doing things right that's the sorting way of doing things i can get"
6780640,6787040," the done i can achieve the goal without even understanding the system and how to use it properly"
6788080,6789680," right so"
6789680,6799920," yeah so like why reading and understanding uh documentation if you can already solve the"
6799920,6806320," problem you can already solve the problem there we go so i understand that there's probably a better way"
6806320,6810480," to do that right so understand there's probably a better way to do that but i'm already streaming for"
6811200,6818800," uh for all like two and a half of an hour right so and i think uh i sort of explored this system"
6818800,6825280," like well enough for a short period of time that i had right because i started from a complete scratch"
6825280,6831360," i started from a complete catch i didn't know anything about this system and i got the heart moving"
6831360,6836000," i got the heart moving i still do not fully understand the system but i guess i can use it so"
6836000,6842000," given enough time maybe like a couple of days i can write a simple game in it right so and it's a"
6842000,6847920," pretty cool system actually this is a pretty cool system uh documentation is rough around the edges but"
6847920,6854720," uh the the author is open to to that open to fixing the condition which is good so i guess i'm"
6854720,6862640," gonna give it back nine out of ten so my final verdict is nine out of ten very cool thing a very cool um"
6862640,6871600," educational system as well uh right so yeah that was uxian i suppose that was uxian i'm gonna play"
6871600,6877840," with this virtual machine a little bit more and uh maybe we'll do more things with it right so people"
6877840,6885520," i suppose people have been using it as a compilation target so there is a c compiler for this stuff um"
6885520,6892480," right so maybe yeah maybe like maybe i'm gonna target port but i mean it's also a static based"
6892480,6898400," language so i don't know we'll see we'll see sounds like a pretty interesting thing to explore further"
6898400,6905120," um definitely definitely definitely definitely all right that's it for today thanks everyone who's"
6905120,6910400," watching me right now i really appreciate it have a good one and i see you all on the next recreation"
6910400,6915280," programming session with mr azuz love you"
