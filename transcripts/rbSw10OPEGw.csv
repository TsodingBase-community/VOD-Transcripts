629980,659960," Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, So today is Sunday and that means today, according to the schedule, we're supposed to be doing a game development in C++, you can find the source code of the game that we'll be developing here in the chat and yeah, let's just jump into it, it's just something, it's some sort of a game that we've been developing for the game, it's just something, it's some sort of a game that we've been developing for the game."
659960,666120," for quite some time and I don't know how it is going, maybe it's going quite well, maybe"
666120,673340," we never will finish the development, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see. So let me let me"
673340,689800," see, let me see what we have here. So let's run Origin and let me merge everything. Origin Master."
689960,696740," Everything is already merged. Don't we have any pull requests to actually merge before we start?"
696740,704900," Something like something. Now we have everything merged, would you look at that. Okay, so I'm"
704900,715740," gonna rebuild everything from scratch just in case. So something debug, something debug."
719960,726320," Okay, so and let's take a look at the game. So yeah, this is holding. I forgot that we changed"
726320,733180," it to Zodin Pog. Yeah, and you can actually shoot it. I completely forgot how it looks like."
733180,740740," Yes, this is so, this is so cool. Yes, you can just do that. Yeah, this is the game right"
740740,749200," now. And yeah, that's, that's pretty cool. Very cool. It's a Zodin Pog. And we also have"
749200,757180," something like, like wave attack. Right, it's not supposed to be used by the player, but yeah,"
757180,763760," player can use it because we need that for testing purposes. Hello, heroes and plots, welcome"
763760,773160," to the stream. Yeah, so this is the game. Hello, Crazy Peders, thank you for the raid. Alright,"
773160,779640," so yeah, I'm just waiting for my tea actually. I don't know, for some reason it takes so much"
779640,787640," time to warm up my water for my tea. But yeah, today we're gonna continue developing this game,"
787640,792520," essentially. Essentially, we're gonna continue developing this game and soon it will be available"
792520,798600," on Steam and we're gonna make a shit ton of money by selling this game for free. That's right,"
798600,805240," that's the plan. Sell this game for free and make a lot of money. Okay, enemies don't have their weapons"
805240,812280," rendered. So yeah, here's the thing. The player does have its weapon rendered, right, but the enemies"
812280,818360," don't. And if I create an enemy, right, so here's an enemy. The enemy can shoot me, but it doesn't have"
818360,829560," any, yeah, any weapon. Yeah, that's really funny. Okay, so let me quickly, let me quickly go to the kitchen,"
829560,835400," pour some hot water and I'm going to be back. I'm going to be back. Fuck."
859560,882440," All right, so yeah, we need to make enemies render their weapons. I wish I could wake up properly,"
882440,887480," for some reason I cannot wake up, even though I woke up like five hours ago, maybe even more."
888760,893160," But right now I'm extremely sleepy for some reason, so I have no idea why."
893160,900200," Do you know Carlson game? No."
900200,917960," So, let's find out why the fuck the weapons are not rendered for the enemies, right, while I'm trying"
917960,925320," I'm trying to wake up. I'm trying to wake up, it's really hard. So, I'm trying to wake up for like five"
925320,929320," hours already. Still didn't manage to do that, still didn't manage to do that."
929320,937560," So, what I need to find, I need to find the game object, right, so here's the game object"
939480,947240," and let's find the render function. So, the render function renders everything. Okay, so here's"
947240,955880," we rendering the weapon of the player. So, the player is an entity, right, the player is an entity"
955880,962040," and we just render its weapon, nothing particularly special, nothing particularly fancy. So, I suppose we"
962040,972040," can do a similar thing here. Oh, what's interesting is that if we're gonna iterate through all of the"
972040,978360," entities, right, through all of the entities and for the alive entities, we're gonna render the current"
978360,983880," weapons, we might as well get rid of this entire code in here. Let's actually see what's gonna happen."
984440,999320," So, enemies offset. Ah, so we're rendering them. Oh yeah, this one is interesting. So, if they are in a"
999320,1007160," different room, they have to be dimmed. Yeah, they have to be dimmed, but only if they are enemies."
1014440,1028040," So, this is a really interesting logic. Like, why is it like that? But anyway. Oh, by the way,"
1028040,1036920," here's the interesting question. Why the the weapon is not rendered by the entity itself?"
1042920,1050600," I saw a name of a file who's triggering lol. What the hell is going on?"
1050600,1061960," So, yeah, it feels like the entities themselves should render the weapon."
1061960,1070040," Right, so let's actually go somewhere here and let me find the rendering of the entities. And I didn't"
1070040,1075480," really see the rendering of the entities, which is... Yeah, here it is. So, we render the particles. Then,"
1075480,1081720," depending on the state of the entity... Depending on the state..."
1085720,1089400," I don't know what it is, I don't know what it was, but it was something outside..."
1089400,1106200," I have no idea what it was. Yeah. Yeah, Slav PLS shit. Nuclear war, yeah."
1109400,1113960," Holy shit. That never happened before, actually. Like, I hear something like that for the first time."
1113960,1116600," So, yeah. I have no idea."
1116600,1125240," Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. People are the worst, seriously."
1127320,1130280," Like, why people do that? Like, holy shit."
1130280,1145320," Okay. So, we need to concentrate. We need to concentrate on what we need to do. So, we're rendering the"
1145320,1153800," character. And the next thing we can do, or we can try to do, we can try to render the weapon. Right, so that's the next thing we do."
1153800,1163320," But first, we need to get the current weapon. Right. So, where is the function? Get current weapon. So, yeah, that's pretty straightforward."
1163320,1174680," So, yeah, it's going to be weapon, weapon. I might as well actually do auto. I mean, I'm programming in C++, and in C++ we have auto."
1174680,1177800," Right. Which is actually useful."
1178680,1185400," C++ also has auto, by the way, but it's useless. This one has auto, and it's useful."
1185400,1195960," So, and if weapon is not null, we can just straight up render that weapon. Hopefully. We'll see, we'll see."
1197320,1203240," So, what we have to do here, we have to just, you know, render. What the fuck is going on?"
1203240,1210040," I literally have no idea. Like, what the fuck?"
1210040,1214440," Uh, so, am I, am I literally getting swallowed?"
1214440,1218600," Uh, Panapudi, welcome. How are you doing? Hello, hello."
1218840,1227000," So, um, so, and I have to provide the game if I want to render the weapon, and also I need to provide the current entity index."
1227000,1233560," What's funny is that I think entities do not know their own indices. I think that's a, that's a thing."
1233560,1239480," Unfortunately. So, the entity itself doesn't really know its own index."
1240680,1245800," Which is kind of sus, but it is what it is."
1245800,1266280," Finally, I have, I have a cup of tea, and it's brewed perfectly. Somehow I managed to brew this cup of tea absolutely perfectly."
1266280,1271720," Sometimes it happens. Uh, but yeah, it's just really, it's really strange."
1271720,1284840," Um, okay, uh, so yeah, I think we do have a reference to the game."
1284840,1288360," We actually don't have a reference to the game if we want to render."
1288360,1292360," Yeah, I think I'm starting to understand why I don't render weapon inside of the player,"
1292360,1295800," because weapon requires too many things to render, unfortunately."
1296280,1303320," Um, so, maybe we shouldn't do that then."
1303320,1305640," Maybe it's not for, it's not for that."
1305640,1307800," So, let's try to do that the other way."
1307800,1314920," Um, so, that means we'll have to get the current weapon, right?"
1314920,1317480," Get the current weapon of the entity."
1318920,1319800," Like this."
1319800,1321480," So, I get current weapon."
1321480,1330200," And only if weapon, uh, was not equal null, we should try to render, uh, that specific weapon."
1330200,1334440," Uh, we should try to render that specific weapon."
1334440,1336440," So, let me quickly try to do that."
1336440,1338520," So, the index in this case is going to be I."
1339080,1345080," And I wonder, I don't remember to be fair, can you dim the weapon when you render it?"
1345080,1346120," So, I'm rendering the weapon."
1346120,1348120," I can provide a shade."
1348120,1352040," Yes, I, I am in fact able to provide a shade."
1352040,1355640," So, uh, here is the thing."
1355640,1358680," So, that means I can copy paste this entire thing in here."
1359240,1364200," And, uh, when I'm rendering it like that, I can provide, just provide the shade."
1364200,1365240," Cool."
1365240,1366840," And another thing."
1366840,1370440," This is, uh, when the enemies are in a room, right?"
1370440,1371720," They can be outside of the room."
1371720,1374840," When they're outside of the room, we shouldn't dim them ever."
1374840,1377960," So, it should be similar to just doing something like this, right?"
1377960,1380440," It should be, like, very much similar to something like this."
1380440,1381000," Zhiyang!"
1381000,1383480," Oh my god, welcome to the stream."
1383480,1385800," The, the master of Linux kernel."
1385800,1386440," Hello, hello."
1386440,1387240," Really glad to see you."
1388360,1390200," You're still building Linux, just."
1390200,1399000," Um, by the way, what is the favorite distro of your professor of that course?"
1399000,1401240," Is it GENTU?"
1401240,1404280," So, yeah."
1404280,1407800," Because this is what a GENTU course feels like."
1407800,1410680," The professor, oh, he uses Windows, I see."
1410680,1412040," Interesting."
1412040,1413560," Yeah."
1416440,1418840," Uh, I'm trying to wake up."
1418840,1420280," I still cannot wake up."
1420280,1424760," Um, and the way I'm trying to wake up is by copy-pasting code around."
1424760,1426360," So, that's how I do that."
1426360,1428680," I already copy-pasted three pieces of code."
1428680,1431080," Um, yeah."
1431080,1432600," Is he also building Windows kernels?"
1432600,1436280," I mean, recently Windows XP source code got leaked."
1436280,1439800," So, maybe technically you can try to build Windows kernels."
1439800,1447560," Um, by the way, has, has anybody ever tried to build this source code like of Windows XP?"
1447560,1451640," Or is it not buildable outside of the Microsoft infrastructure?"
1451640,1456280," I could imagine that's absolutely not buildable outside of Microsoft infrastructure."
1459320,1461320," I was building Windows kernel on stream."
1461320,1463560," So, what's up, GENTU?"
1463560,1464200," What's up?"
1464200,1464680," Wake up."
1464680,1465720," I'm trying to wake up."
1465720,1466280," I cannot."
1466280,1471800," Even nuclear war behind my window can, cannot wake me up."
1471800,1472760," Yeah."
1472760,1476360," We have really weird sounds coming up from the, from the outside."
1476360,1478360," And even that can wake me up."
1478360,1478840," I'm sorry."
1478840,1482600," All right."
1482600,1483880," So, yeah."
1483880,1486360," It's really bright, bright today."
1486360,1490840," Is if weapon legal C++?"
1490840,1491400," Yes, it is."
1491400,1493160," Hello, one slide left."
1493160,1493720," Hello, hello."
1493720,1495960," So, basically."
1495960,1498280," Yeah."
1498280,1501640," So, you're suggesting to change to something like this?"
1501640,1505880," I think it's going to be legal C++, but I like to be a little bit more explicit."
1505880,1507800," Yeah."
1508840,1518920," I think they didn't ditch that in C++, so they left it from C."
1518920,1527560," As far as I know, you can even, like for a particular class, if you have a particular class,"
1527560,1531400," like full, you can overload an operator."
1531400,1534200," I think, I forgot how you do that, right?"
1534200,1538040," So, operator something like int or something."
1538040,1545800," And basically, it, it will be called when you try to use the instance of the object in a context of if,"
1545800,1546680," right?"
1546680,1549160," So, something like implicit conversion operator."
1549160,1553800," And so, your object can be converted to a boolean or to an integer or to a point."
1553800,1557080," So, you can even control these kind of situations."
1557080,1560040," I think it's called the implicit conversion operator or whatever."
1560040,1564040," I do know that something like if stream have this overloaded."
1564040,1571240," So, you can just use if if stream to check whether you reach the end of the if stream."
1572120,1573800," So, let me see how they do that."
1573800,1575720," Oh, operator."
1575720,1577800," Yeah."
1577800,1578040," Yeah."
1578040,1579640," Operator boolean, I think."
1579640,1583400," But it's, yeah, it's starting from C++ 11."
1584040,1585720," Yeah, this is how we do that, essentially."
1585720,1587480," So, yeah."
1587480,1589480," So, you overload it like that."
1589480,1594600," You never use that?"
1594600,1597880," Well, it's a pretty interesting feature of C++ that I personally never use."
1597880,1602680," But yeah, I used it once when I was, you know, programming a lot in C++ in the"
1602680,1604760," ideomatic C++."
1606680,1611480," Not in the weird C/C++ I program these days, but in something like this."
1611480,1614200," Yeah, using STL and stuff."
1614200,1617320," I kind of miss those days."
1617320,1622280," I kind of want to program, I kind of want to have an opportunity to program like in a"
1622280,1631720," in an ideomatic C++ with classes, constructors, virtual methods, destructors and stuff like that."
1632280,1637160," Even though it's probably, you know, slower than just in a C style."
1637160,1640280," But it's kind of interesting for intellectual masturbation purposes."
1640280,1642760," You know what I mean?"
1642760,1643960," You know what I mean?"
1643960,1644040," You know what I mean?"
1644040,1645640," It will be kind of cool."
1645640,1652680," Okay."
1652680,1659560," So, maybe there should be like a template command that accepts this parameter as the argument."
1659560,1660440," Right."
1661880,1664040," So, yeah."
1664040,1667400," Okay."
1667400,1668040," What do we have?"
1668040,1670760," Let me rebuild everything, by the way."
1670760,1674680," Something debug."
1674680,1678920," Okay."
1678920,1685080," So, now I'm gonna do something debug and here's the game."
1685080,1686760," I can do pew, pew, pew, pew, pew."
1686760,1688680," Maybe I can also do pew, pew, pew."
1688680,1689960," Okay."
1689960,1690200," Cool."
1690920,1692040," So, let's go somewhere."
1692040,1696200," So, the look and feel of the game is not final, by the way."
1696200,1696840," Oh, yeah."
1696840,1698200," And now it also has the weapon."
1698200,1699400," Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
1699400,1700120," And look at that."
1700120,1701640," Weapon is dimmed, right?"
1701640,1704920," So, the enemy is in a different room."
1704920,1706120," And, yeah."
1706120,1708280," So, their weapon is dimmed."
1708280,1710120," So, everything is working correctly."
1710760,1711960," So, that's actually perfect."
1711960,1712120," So, that's actually perfect."
1712120,1712840," I like that."
1712840,1717720," So, but that was achieved by copy-pasting shotgun of code."
1717720,1720360," And in my opinion, that's not an ideal solution."
1720360,1722520," That's very much..."
1722520,1726200," And I died in my own game."
1726200,1727640," Thank you very much."
1727640,1743480," So, the thing is, how can we simplify this copy-paste that I introduced?"
1743480,1745720," How can we simplify that copy-paste?"
1745720,1755080," So, essentially, the only reason why we check for this thingy is to whether provide the special shade"
1755080,1757080," or not provide the special shade."
1757080,1759880," But what I'm thinking is that, what if we introduce..."
1759880,1762040," So, here is the original code."
1762040,1765000," And let's see how much of the code we'll be able to compress."
1765000,1767400," So, I'm going to introduce RGBA."
1767400,1769800," And I'm going to call it a shade."
1769800,1770920," All right."
1770920,1774520," ""If username Tsojing will die, don't die."""
1774520,1775720," Yeah."
1775720,1778840," That's a good code."
1778840,1780680," Okay."
1780680,1782600," So, here is my condition."
1782600,1784040," Here is my condition."
1784040,1792200," I'm going to initially initialize it."
1792200,1795640," Initially initialize it with zero initialization."
1795640,1803800," And if this condition is true..."
1803800,1805640," Right."
1805640,1811640," We're going to set the shade to ""Room Neighbor Dim Color""."
1811640,1812600," That's it."
1812600,1817480," And now I'm pretty sure the only thing I need to do now..."
1817480,1819240," Right."
1819240,1820920," Is something like this."
1820920,1831640," There we go."
1831640,1837720," So, I managed to replace this thing with just this."
1838600,1839640," Did it become better?"
1839640,1842120," Arguably."
1842120,1846760," But, I mean, at least I don't copy-paste this piece of code anymore."
1846760,1849720," So, now I managed to compress it into a single piece of code."
1849720,1851800," So, yeah."
1851800,1853080," Maybe it became better."
1853080,1856040," On top of that, let's actually see if it still behaves the same."
1856040,1859800," If it still produces the results that we expect here."
1859800,1861400," So, it's going to do something debug."
1861400,1862440," And here you go."
1862440,1866760," And it doesn't even compile."
1866760,1867640," Would you look at that?"
1867640,1869000," Inexpaction of macro..."
1869000,1870120," Oh, yeah."
1870120,1874040," This is because I marked that variable as const."
1874040,1876040," And that was a very dumb idea."
1876840,1877240," Yeah."
1877240,1879720," So, I should have not marked it as const."
1879720,1886360," All right."
1886360,1888440," So, let's spawn an enemy."
1888440,1889560," And an enemy."
1889560,1890120," Okay."
1890120,1890920," Nice."
1890920,1893720," So, that means I fucked up the condition."
1893720,1895800," So, I think it should be something like opposite."
1895800,1897160," It should be opposite logic."
1897160,1897960," If you know what I mean."
1897960,1903400," Reminds me of Noita."
1903400,1904520," I have no idea what that is."
1904520,1909000," Is that some sort of an indie game?"
1909000,1911560," That I never heard about?"
1911560,1915640," Oh, it looks nice."
1915640,1917560," I really like how it looks like."
1917560,1920360," Never played it."
1924200,1927720," But keep in mind that the look and feel of the game is not final here."
1927720,1927960," All right."
1927960,1929080," It's just a programmer's art."
1929080,1931720," It's just a programmer's art."
1931720,1933320," I just found some garbage on the internet."
1933320,1935160," And I just put it together really quickly."
1935160,1936760," Just to test."
1936760,1938280," Just to have something on the screen."
1938280,1940680," So, it's going to look completely different."
1940680,1941000," Okay."
1941000,1942280," So, here is the stuff."
1942280,1943240," And..."
1943240,1944920," Okay."
1944920,1946280," This one is interesting."
1946280,1947400," It doesn't properly dim."
1947400,1949240," Huh."
1949240,1951640," Huh."
1951640,1953240," All right."
1953240,1956440," So, I think I kind of know what's wrong in here."
1956440,1958680," Yeah, boy."
1958680,1959880," A boy."
1959880,1961000," A boy."
1961000,1962200," All right."
1962200,1970520," So, basically we managed to replace this piece of code with this simple piece of code."
1970520,1973720," And let's just go ahead and remove it."
1973720,1974920," I think it became better."
1974920,1976600," I think it became more manageable."
1976600,1977240," You know."
1977240,1980360," The quality of code has been increased."
1980360,1981560," Yes."
1981560,1985400," Everyone is talking about mythical quality of code."
1985400,1988280," And I'm here actually increasing it."
1988280,1990040," Oh my god."
1990040,1991320," Class 232."
1991320,1992440," Subscribe to tier 1."
1992440,1994760," Thank you so much for your subscription."
1994760,1998440," And welcome to Epic Game Development Club."
1998440,1999320," How about that?"
2001240,2002200," How about that?"
2002200,2003000," How about that?"
2003000,2004360," All right."
2004360,2007000," What do we got?"
2007000,2008440," What do we got?"
2008440,2012360," So, essentially we have a duplicate in the loop."
2012360,2015240," So, here is like a big condition in here."
2015240,2016440," You know."
2016440,2017400," Just a big condition."
2017400,2020440," And we have a little bit of a duplicate here."
2020440,2021160," So, yeah."
2021160,2023080," And we pretty much do the same thing."
2023080,2028280," So, the only differences here is that we don't have any conditions in here."
2028280,2030040," And we always dim everything."
2030040,2031800," So, what I'm thinking."
2031800,2036600," What if we move this logic."
2036600,2041320," We move this logic into this condition."
2041320,2044600," And just get rid of the else branch."
2044600,2045240," You know what I mean?"
2045240,2046920," You know what I mean?"
2046920,2050920," So, essentially we should be able to convert this entire thing."
2050920,2055560," Like we should be able to get rid of this condition completely."
2055560,2056920," Right."
2056920,2059960," And just add something like this."
2059960,2061160," Like maybe."
2061160,2064040," So, if not lock."
2064040,2065400," We should always dim."
2065400,2067320," Meaning that not lock."
2067320,2071240," Or if it's inside of lock."
2071240,2073000," So, yeah."
2073000,2074040," If I understand correctly."
2074040,2077160," We should be able to just squash this logic like that."
2077160,2080600," So, lock means that we have some sort of a lock currently."
2080600,2082440," Yeah."
2082440,2084440," So, we have a lock inside of the camera."
2084440,2085720," And if we don't have it."
2085720,2087480," Don't even try to do anything here."
2087480,2088520," Always dim."
2088520,2089080," So, yeah."
2089080,2090680," That's actually a way better solution."
2090680,2092440," Okay."
2092440,2094280," So, let's see if it's going to work now."
2094280,2097800," We're rebuilding everything."
2097800,2098280," Of course."
2098280,2099320," Of course."
2099320,2099800," Of course."
2099800,2100920," Uh."
2100920,2101240," Okay."
2101240,2102440," Let me spoil."
2102440,2105160," Interesting."
2105160,2106360," That didn't work."
2106360,2109000," And that straight up segfaulted."
2109000,2109960," Isn't that amazing?"
2109960,2111240," I think it's goddamn amazing."
2111240,2113000," So, uh."
2113000,2114760," How do we even use that then?"
2114760,2116440," So, lock abs."
2116440,2118120," Ah."
2118120,2120040," I see."
2120040,2122600," So, we actually have to do this thing."
2122600,2123080," All right."
2123080,2128760," Yeah."
2128760,2131000," This is a little bit more complicated apparently."
2131000,2131320," Okay."
2131320,2137000," Apparently a little bit more complicated than I thought."
2143320,2144280," But that's really strange."
2144280,2145080," Right."
2145080,2149400," Okay."
2149400,2150040," I see."
2150040,2151880," So, this is too complicated."
2151880,2153560," So, I'll probably have to back up."
2153560,2157080," So, yeah."
2157080,2158120," I tried."
2158120,2158760," I failed."
2158760,2159720," I understand."
2159720,2161640," So, let's try to recompile it back."
2161640,2165000," And hope that maybe it will not segfold anymore."
2167960,2168280," Uh."
2168280,2169880," So, let's."
2169880,2170840," Go."
2170840,2172200," Yeah."
2172200,2173640," So, it doesn't segfold anymore."
2173640,2175400," Let me create an enemy here."
2175400,2176600," Enemy is completely dipped."
2176600,2177640," Dimmed."
2177640,2178120," Not dipped."
2178120,2179560," And."
2179560,2179960," Yes."
2179960,2180280," Yes."
2180280,2180440," Yes."
2180440,2180600," Yes."
2180600,2184360," Oh, what's funny is that."
2184360,2184760," Yeah."
2184760,2188280," A dead enemy still draw their weapons."
2188280,2190200," So, and this is something I was talking about."
2190200,2190680," I think."
2190680,2191960," Yeah."
2191960,2195640," I think we shouldn't draw enemies of a dead."
2197080,2198520," Like weapons of dead enemies."
2198520,2201880," And that's why the rendering of the weapon should be inside of the entity."
2201880,2202920," But I didn't."
2202920,2204200," Didn't do that for some reason."
2204200,2207160," Uh."
2207160,2215640," I really want to squash this condition."
2215640,2218200," I feel like it should be possible to squash this condition."
2218200,2219800," But it makes it kind of difficult."
2219800,2222840," It makes it kind of difficult."
2222840,2224440," So."
2224440,2225800," Yeah."
2225800,2226200," Yeah."
2226200,2229560," Maybe I shouldn't try."
2229560,2232920," Uh."
2232920,2234920," And interesting question."
2234920,2236840," Interesting question."
2236840,2237160," Like."
2237160,2239560," Do we really need to separate this kind of stuff?"
2239560,2240760," I don't know."
2240760,2241960," All right."
2241960,2248200," So."
2248200,2249560," And also."
2249560,2251640," Before trying to render this entire stuff."
2251640,2252360," Here is."
2252360,2252600," Let's."
2252600,2253560," Let's do a simple trick."
2254280,2254760," Weapon."
2254760,2254760," Weapon."
2254760,2254760," Weapon."
2254760,2254760," Weapon."
2254760,2255400," Is not null."
2255400,2255880," And."
2255880,2256600," Entities."
2256600,2257320," State."
2257320,2257880," Uh."
2257880,2259080," Equal."
2259080,2260360," Entity."
2260360,2261080," State."
2261080,2261800," Uh."
2261800,2262360," Alive."
2262360,2262840," Right."
2262840,2263240," So."
2263240,2263720," Basically."
2263720,2265240," We're going to always try to check."
2265240,2265960," That the entity is alive."
2265960,2267160," That the entity is alive."
2267160,2267560," Uh."
2267560,2268840," Before trying to render it."
2268840,2269600," And."
2269600,2271260," Copy pasting this kind of stuff."
2271260,2272740," Is actually a pretty bad sign."
2272740,2273080," Because."
2273080,2274520," What if the logic changes?"
2274520,2275880," I will have to change that."
2275880,2276780," In all of the places."
2276780,2278280," Where we need to render all of that."
2278280,2279240," Uh."
2279240,2279560," So."
2279560,2280200," Again."
2280200,2281520," We have a lot of duplication."
2281520,2282560," Uh."
2282560,2283480," In our nation."
2283480,2284060," But."
2284060,2285400," That's something that we do."
2285400,2286680," That's something that we do."
2286680,2288920," So."
2288920,2291020," I was not declared."
2291020,2291360," Okay."
2291360,2292920," This is because I want to use index."
2292920,2293240," Chat."
2293240,2294200," Why are you dead?"
2294200,2296660," I made only one mistake."
2296660,2296980," Okay."
2296980,2297420," Okay."
2297420,2299200," I made a small mistake."
2299200,2300980," And I couldn't actually squash this."
2300980,2301600," If else."
2301600,2301840," But."
2301840,2302700," Doesn't mean that."
2302700,2304340," You have to become dead."
2304500,2306100," Why do you punish me so much?"
2306100,2306980," I'm sorry."
2306980,2309240," I do understand that I'm not good."
2309240,2309600," Uh."
2309600,2310200," With developer."
2310200,2310620," But."
2310620,2312980," Uh."
2312980,2314180," All right."
2314180,2316940," I'm joking."
2316940,2317940," I'm joking."
2317940,2319920," Yes."
2319920,2320960," It's kind of funny."
2320960,2321200," Like."
2321200,2322420," Every time."
2322420,2323120," I."
2323120,2323520," Like."
2323520,2325020," Slightly fuck up."
2325020,2325720," With my."
2325720,2326400," You know."
2326400,2326980," Uh."
2326980,2328000," With my solution."
2328000,2329500," Chat becomes."
2329500,2330660," Instantly dead."
2330660,2331220," And."
2331220,2332020," I drop like."
2332020,2332760," 20 viewers."
2332760,2333820," It's just like."
2333960,2334620," So funny."
2334620,2334840," Like."
2334840,2335820," What?"
2335820,2336460," Like."
2336460,2338060," I just."
2338060,2339460," Make a small mistake."
2339460,2340700," While doing thing."
2340700,2340940," And."
2340940,2341360," There you go."
2341360,2341520," No."
2341520,2342940," You're fucking bad developer."
2342940,2343800," Go fuck yourself."
2343800,2346240," Ah."
2346240,2347600," Yeah."
2347600,2347940," So."
2347940,2348440," Essentially."
2348440,2349780," I'm not allowed to make mistakes."
2349780,2352480," It is what it is."
2352480,2352800," Chat."
2352800,2354140," And it isn't what it isn't."
2354140,2354960," Um."
2354960,2357540," I wonder if viewers live."
2357540,2358380," Because chat is dead."
2358380,2359020," Ah."
2359020,2360100," Maybe they're somehow."
2360100,2360620," Like."
2360620,2362120," Connected."
2363420,2366920," So."
2366920,2366960," So."
2366960,2366960," So."
2366960,2383240," Okay."
2383240,2384900," So."
2384900,2385660," Unfortunately."
2385660,2386960," It's kind of."
2386960,2391500," It's kind of."
2391500,2392260," Difficult."
2392260,2393560," To move."
2393560,2394240," Uh."
2394240,2395700," Rendering of the weapon."
2395700,2396780," Inside."
2396780,2398140," Uh."
2398140,2399940," Inside."
2399940,2401020," Of the entity."
2401020,2402020," Precisely."
2402020,2402920," Because the entity."
2402920,2404080," Needs to know."
2404080,2404500," It's."
2404500,2404780," I."
2404780,2405140," Uh."
2405140,2405860," It's index."
2405860,2406620," But unfortunately."
2406620,2407260," The entities."
2407260,2408280," Do not know."
2408280,2409000," Their indices."
2409000,2410440," Um."
2410440,2411600," Which is kind of."
2411600,2412720," Sad."
2412720,2413720," I'm gonna lie."
2414340,2414700," So."
2414700,2415200," It is."
2415200,2415680," In fact."
2415680,2416240," Kind of sad."
2416240,2418900," So."
2418900,2419780," We need to understand."
2419780,2420360," Why."
2420360,2422000," Do I need to."
2422000,2422720," Pass."
2422720,2423300," So."
2423300,2423860," Much."
2423860,2424440," Information."
2424440,2425120," To."
2425120,2425760," The."
2425760,2427700," To the weapon."
2427700,2428380," Right."
2428380,2429340," Um."
2431840,2432840," So."
2432840,2433560," Let me go."
2433560,2434280," In here."
2434280,2434760," And."
2434760,2435500," When I'm rendering."
2435500,2435940," Yes."
2435940,2436120," So."
2436120,2436660," Essentially."
2436660,2437980," Here it is."
2437980,2439400," Here it fucking is."
2439400,2439700," So."
2439700,2440800," Why do I need to do that?"
2440800,2441280," Uh."
2441280,2441840," Weapon."
2441840,2442600," Cpp."
2442600,2443640," And."
2443640,2444080," Uh."
2444080,2444720," When I'm rendering."
2444720,2445760," So."
2445760,2446500," I'm using the game."
2446500,2447100," For what?"
2447100,2448260," I'm using the game."
2448260,2448680," For."
2448680,2449840," Actually."
2449840,2451140," Checking the other stuff."
2451140,2451360," Okay."
2451360,2451560," So."
2451560,2451920," Weapon."
2451920,2453180," To be able to render."
2453180,2454660," To be rendered."
2454660,2455420," Needs to."
2455420,2457520," Uh."
2457520,2459780," Yeah."
2459840,2460840," It needs the camera."
2460840,2462380," It needs some other stuff."
2462380,2462860," So."
2462860,2463380," The camera."
2463380,2464220," For example."
2464220,2465400," Something like a renderer."
2465400,2466080," Could have been."
2466080,2467220," Part."
2467220,2468420," Of the camera."
2468420,2469280," And what not."
2469280,2473220," Uh."
2473220,2477020," All right."
2477020,2478940," So."
2478940,2484500," Yes."
2484500,2484940," Yes."
2484940,2485360," Yes."
2485360,2485780," Okay."
2485780,2486080," So."
2486080,2486960," The game is used."
2486960,2487600," Uh."
2487600,2488460," For."
2488460,2488700," For."
2488700,2489580," This kind of stuff."
2489840,2492980," Okay."
2492980,2493720," So."
2493720,2494640," In the placer."
2494640,2495940," The game."
2495940,2496680," Is used."
2496680,2497120," To."
2497120,2497780," Actually."
2497780,2498240," Know."
2498240,2499620," Where to place things."
2499620,2501240," Uh."
2501240,2501600," And."
2501600,2502480," Entity index."
2502480,2503120," Where do we use."
2503120,2503800," Entity index."
2503800,2504460," We use it."
2504460,2505040," Uh."
2505040,2505580," To actually."
2505580,2506040," Find."
2506040,2507200," The entity itself."
2507200,2508420," And also."
2508420,2508680," Check."
2508680,2509020," Where."
2509020,2510020," Whether you can place."
2510020,2510860," This kind of stuff."
2510860,2511260," I see."
2511260,2513480," Uh."
2513480,2514140," So."
2514140,2514820," We might as well."
2514820,2515400," Actually."
2515400,2516020," Do."
2516020,2516660," A very."
2516660,2517240," Interesting."
2517240,2517740," Trick."
2518180,2518620," And."
2518620,2523460," Just."
2523460,2524140," When we render."
2524140,2524700," The entity."
2524700,2525380," Just."
2525380,2526680," Pass all of that information."
2526680,2527360," For the weapon."
2527360,2527780," Because."
2527780,2528220," Why not."
2528220,2529080," Why not."
2529080,2529920," Why not just do that."
2529920,2531660," Uh."
2531660,2533460," Why not just do that."
2533640,2538280," So, entity.hp... I'm trying to find entity.hp."
2538280,2548820," So, I already accept a camera, I already accept a renderer, and to be fair, do I not have the renderer?"
2548820,2551560," Where do I keep the renderer? Okay, renderer is here."
2551560,2559620," So, and maybe I'm going to just do the following thing, I'm going to accept the game, so the whole game."
2560280,2565900," It feels like, at any point, I always need to have an access to the whole game."
2565900,2569040," That's what it feels like, right?"
2569040,2582300," Right, so any sort of class, at any point, needs to be able to just straight up go to the game, and just do something with it, because, yeah, that's what it needs to do."
2582300,2589940," Because the objects are located within the game, right, they are within the game, so the game has to be some sort of a global thing."
2591160,2602780," And, maybe that's... And I'm starting to notice that, so this is not the first, like, game where I'm starting to notice that, yeah, you need, like, a constant access to the global state."
2605280,2611220," But I always was afraid to do that, because, you know, years of enterprise, like, taught me that a global variable is bad."
2615420,2621260," But that's exactly what you want to do here, because the complexity is so huge that, yeah, that's what you need to do."
2621260,2629800," Otherwise, you're going to introduce so much unnecessary friction, it's just insane."
2630760,2635020," Is this insane how much friction you're going to introduce at any particular point?"
2635020,2646040," So, it feels like, almost like, if you're developing, like, a game, what you're going to be having, essentially, is just a structure, a game."
2646700,2651880," You're going to just allocate that structure on, like, the static memory, or maybe dynamic, whatever."
2651880,2653480," But it's going to be a global variable."
2653480,2663040," All right, and whatever you create in the future, right, so something like player, right, player, is going to have methods, like, render."
2663260,2668100," And at any point, the player may want to check something within the game."
2668100,2668640," Always."
2668640,2672120," It always wants to check something within the game."
2672120,2673980," Yes, it's almost like a database."
2673980,2675180," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2675180,2676900," It's almost like a database."
2676900,2689700," All these, you know, advocates of, like, clean code talking about, like, global variables bad, but never actually noticing that database is a huge fucking global variable."
2689700,2701660," And that's what makes this, like, CRUD application so easy to develop, because, yeah, you have a huge global mutable state, and, yeah, everything just can, at any point, can access that state."
2701660,2708560," And you can use that state to establish communication between different parts of your application."
2708560,2715020," So, it's just kind of, people don't understand sometimes what they're talking about."
2715020,2717340," So, yeah."
2718360,2719240," It's kind of interesting."
2719240,2724020," I wonder how a game that actually does, like, have, like, a global game look like."
2724020,2725200," Is it..."
2725200,2728940," Does it quickly become a mess, or does it not?"
2728940,2742980," And what's funny is that, yeah, the game itself should probably have the player, have an instance of the player, and the player should be able to access itself at any point, right?"
2743160,2746820," So, by doing something like that, the player essentially accesses itself."
2746820,2748820," You know what I mean?"
2748820,2754480," And you want to be able to do this kind of stuff."
2754480,2762440," Or maybe..."
2762440,2772100," To be fair, it makes it kind of difficult to test things around, right?"
2772200,2774080," Or, because everything becomes very coupled."
2774080,2778660," What if we couple things via the game itself?"
2778660,2785080," What if we still keep the game private to everything else by keeping it, for example, in main?"
2785080,2786180," Right."
2786540,2789940," But always pass this game as an argument."
2789940,2791280," Like this."
2791280,2793080," Right."
2799260,2801180," Always pass this game as an argument."
2801180,2807860," So, that way, you can sort of decouple things a little bit."
2807860,2812860," But at the same time, you don't have to pass too many things around."
2812860,2821820," Hmm, yeah, sounds like a pretty cool thing."
2821920,2825000," And inside of the game, you're going to have things like camera, right?"
2825000,2829380," Camera, SDL, renderer, renderer, right?"
2829380,2835780," And at any point, if you want to render something, you just grab the renderer and the camera from the game."
2835780,2841200," So, you don't have to ever pass them around all the time."
2841200,2843660," You only have to pass around the game itself, right?"
2843760,2846140," So, you just don't have to worry about that too much."
2846140,2849700," So, I kind of like this idea."
2849700,2852240," But you're never going to have more than one game."
2852240,2853720," So, why do you..."
2853720,2855060," That's a good point, actually."
2855060,2855980," One last thing."
2855980,2856980," That's a good point."
2856980,2860260," So, again, I'm not a game developer."
2860260,2862700," So, you're a professional game developer."
2862700,2863240," I'm not."
2863240,2868120," So, I'm actually discovering all these patterns, like, myself, recently."
2868120,2873420," Because the majority of my life, I was doing, like, Java Enterprise with, you know,"
2873760,2881380," Like, you know, with all of this, like, dependency injection bullshit and huge frameworks and stuff like that."
2881380,2882880," And that completely damaged my brain."
2882880,2887940," And, which kind of makes it difficult for me to develop in that particular style."
2887940,2888600," So, that's why."
2888600,2890800," It's a good point."
2890800,2891600," It's a good point."
2891600,2892720," I'm so sorry."
2892720,2894100," Yeah, don't be sorry about that."
2894100,2899100," I was born in a pretty..."
2899100,2902160," Pretty strange place, right?"
2902160,2903960," I needed to make money."
2903960,2905320," So, I took any job."
2905320,2907920," So, it is what it is."
2907920,2909020," And it isn't what it is."
2909020,2916760," So, I never had an opportunity to even consider working at, you know, places where people program like that."
2916760,2918360," Like, I never even had an option."
2918360,2919400," Seriously."
2919400,2922060," So, it is what it is."
2925060,2926060," Uh, yeah."
2926060,2928960," Interesting."
2928960,2931400," Until I learned English."
2931400,2935920," Once I learned how to speak English, I actually started to work remotely."
2935920,2938320," And now I have way more opportunities."
2942960,2945460," So, Java destroyed this map."
2945460,2947320," Yes."
2947320,2949500," Java destroyed me."
2949500,2958960," I kind of want to develop like a small game to test this idea of just keeping the global state all the time."
2959920,2967340," And if it works out well, I might as well migrate something to that particular style."
2967340,2969500," That would be actually kind of cool."
2969500,2973160," So, the question is, what kind of game should we develop?"
2973160,2977400," Something complex enough where this kind of stuff would make sense."
2982680,2989260," I could probably port that JavaScript to SDL, but I'm not sure how useful that is."
2989260,2995440," I have a solid book."
2995440,2996900," I'm sorry, I don't read books."
2996900,2999860," I have a problem with focusing and reading books."
2999860,3002220," So, I just basically don't read them."
3002220,3004940," Um..."
3004940,3014720," And if you..."
3014720,3021560," Even if you manage to send it to me, I'm pretty sure Russian postal service will basically lose it in the middle of the way somewhere."
3021560,3022780," So, don't even worry about it."
3022780,3028060," I still haven't received my Hacktoberfest t-shirt."
3028060,3031860," Do you guys remember that chat show with the Hacktoberfest on GitHub?"
3031860,3034680," Yeah, I participated in it."
3034820,3038980," And I basically submitted four pull requests."
3038980,3041040," And, yeah."
3041040,3043500," I ordered the t-shirt and it still didn't arrive."
3043500,3045280," Thank you, Russian postal service."
3045280,3046040," Very cool."
3046040,3051840," I think there is an argument to be had when talking about a big game with tons of developers."
3051840,3053960," Objects encapsulation might have place then."
3053960,3056480," But with one developer, global state, no downside."
3056480,3056860," Yeah."
3056860,3058000," That makes sense."
3058000,3062120," Is the code on your GitHub?"
3062120,3062520," Yes."
3062520,3063680," Everything is on my GitHub."
3063680,3064700," You can find everything."
3064700,3065860," Something in here."
3065860,3069980," Let's actually try to develop some small game."
3069980,3071120," All right."
3071120,3072420," Something small."
3072420,3073960," With SDL and shit."
3073960,3078680," And just test this idea of having like a global game thing."
3078680,3080860," And to be fair..."
3080860,3084580," Maybe we're talking about different things."
3084820,3085260," Yeah."
3085260,3093200," I just want to test things out."
3093200,3094140," I just want to test things out."
3094140,3095600," So..."
3095600,3099260," All right."
3103260,3103860," I'm going to do a C++."
3103860,3113420," I'm going to change my title."
3113420,3115860," So, it's going to be a super quick game."
3115860,3118800," I don't even know what I'm going to develop."
3118800,3119860," Just something."
3119860,3121100," Just something."
3121100,3135260," So, I'm just thinking how should I call the game."
3137260,3142220," 3GSS."
3142220,3142820," I don't know."
3142820,3144800," This is how I'm going to call it."
3144800,3148860," So, recently I started to call all of my projects like that."
3148860,3151420," It's just a random combination of letters and whatnot."
3151420,3167540," So, what we need to do here."
3167540,3171880," I'm probably going to use, you know, SDL yet again."
3171880,3177780," So, let's include SDL."
3177780,3181280," SDL.h."
3181720,3182620," I think..."
3182620,3184300," I forgot how to do that."
3184300,3185560," I think I can just do it like that."
3185560,3188100," I can just include SDL.h and that should be enough."
3188100,3190660," So, then I can init SDL."
3190660,3192000," SDL video init."
3192000,3193300," Right."
3193300,3194920," And then I can do SDL quit."
3194920,3197760," So, let me see what's going to happen here."
3197760,3200880," So, we're going to have a make file."
3200880,3205160," So, and in here, what we're going to have?"
3205160,3207840," 3GSS."
3207840,3209260," It's going to main.cpp."
3210600,3212700," It's going to be CXX."
3212700,3215700," And then we're going to have CXX flags."
3215700,3223420," And also, we're going to have libs against which we're going to link everything."
3224140,3226380," So, in terms of flags, what we're going to have here?"
3226380,3228280," We're going to have a W-O, W-R."
3228280,3231020," No, not W-R, but W-Extra for sure."
3231020,3233760," The standards are going to be C++17."
3233760,3235420," I don't have a C++20."
3235420,3237760," And C++20 doesn't exist, as everyone knows."
3237760,3243560," And we also want to be very pedantic about what kind of feature we're using here, I think."
3244480,3246580," So, maybe also disable exceptions."
3246580,3247260," I don't know."
3247260,3248760," Maybe, maybe it doesn't matter."
3248760,3251100," But I won't disable them, nonetheless."
3251900,3255580," So, another thing we're going to do is probably do a package config."
3255580,3260480," Package config.cflags on sdl2, if I remember correctly."
3260480,3262480," I don't remember if it's going to work or not."
3262480,3264760," So, let me do it."
3264760,3265580," Yeah, it does work."
3265580,3265980," Beautiful."
3266520,3266680," Okay."
3266680,3273180," Libs, and it's going to be package config.cflags on sdl2."
3273180,3275800," And I think that will work as well."
3275800,3278040," And that seems to be working."
3278040,3278420," Okay."
3278420,3281920," So, now, if I try to build this entire stuff, let's see what's going to happen."
3281920,3286760," And so, in a function start undefined reference main."
3286760,3288180," That is not true."
3288180,3289220," Here it is."
3289220,3290280," Here is the main."
3290280,3294360," Is that because it has to be what?"
3296520,3298520," Oh, I know."
3298520,3299380," Yeah, yeah."
3299380,3301160," I forgot to provide main security."
3301160,3305740," I forgot to actually compile it."
3305740,3307000," It's so fucking dumb."
3307000,3313220," So, can we actually appreciate how useless compiler message is?"
3313220,3317700," Instead of saying, bruh, you forgot to provide the file."
3317700,3319600," It says, cannot find main."
3319600,3323660," Holy shit."
3324280,3327300," Like, I mean, you know that I didn't provide any file."
3327300,3329480," Just tell me that I didn't provide the file."
3329480,3331900," Why do you make it difficult for me to..."
3331900,3332720," Holy shit."
3332720,3334900," Like, how more obscure can you make?"
3334900,3337040," Yeah, it's because it has a linker step."
3337040,3337840," And yeah."
3337840,3341540," And we can also discuss how useful linker is in 2021."
3343540,3357420," All right."
3357420,3361620," Was it a declarative video?"
3361620,3364020," Was it init video?"
3364020,3366500," It was."
3366500,3367520," Would you look at that?"
3367700,3369580," It actually was."
3369580,3371020," Naizu."
3371020,3372160," Naizu, naizu, naizu, naizu."
3372160,3375040," Um, all right."
3375040,3378580," So, and of course, SDL init can fail."
3378580,3379880," And you know me."
3379880,3385960," I like to create this stupid function that actually checks the result of SDL and crashes."
3388040,3391260," Streamline gives huge delays for me, so I watch via web."
3391260,3392260," Interesting."
3392260,3398100," I wonder if the delay is actually artificial and made by Twitch."
3398100,3403540," Maybe they somehow detect that you're not watching via the web and basically delay it for you."
3403540,3404440," Something like that."
3404440,3406460," They could be."
3406460,3408320," They actually could be doing that."
3412320,3414900," So, uh, all right."
3414900,3419160," So, let's introduce something like, um, SDL error check."
3419160,3423880," So, and, uh, this thing is going to accept the code."
3423880,3424660," Right."
3424660,3426060," Oh, shit."
3426060,3427100," Should I use AIDS?"
3427100,3428440," I think I should use AIDS."
3428440,3432060," For those who doesn't know, uh, AIDS is my replacement for STD."
3432060,3436300," So, I have to actually mention that just in case people will misunderstand me."
3436300,3437540," Right."
3437540,3439320," So, let's do it for that."
3439320,3442980," So, let's, um, so let's actually grab AIDS."
3442980,3446800," And let's-a go."
3446800,3450740," Because I think, like, I fill it up with pretty useful things."
3450740,3452160," So, yeah."
3452160,3454000," I generally find it very useful."
3454000,3458360," Um, all right."
3458360,3461200," So, let me do this thing."
3461200,3462160," Um."
3462160,3468820," And, uh, what we're gonna do here."
3468900,3474340," We're gonna include AIDS.hpp and also using namespace AIDS."
3474340,3475340," Okay."
3475340,3481340," So, uh, if code is less than zero, uh, what we have to do here."
3481340,3484480," We have to say panic, uh, SDL error."
3484480,3485640," Right."
3485640,3490120," And then, um, maybe we can do something like with SDL error."
3490120,3494440," And then we can provide, uh, SDL get error like this."
3494440,3496960," Uh, otherwise we can return the code."
3497460,3498800," So, yeah."
3498800,3502280," And now I should be able to always wrap these things around like that."
3502280,3503940," Uh, every time we call SDL."
3503940,3508960," So, we have a special function that checks the code and, uh, crashes the whole application"
3508960,3510040," if something went wrong."
3510040,3511160," So, we don't have to do that."
3511160,3513840," So, yeah."
3513840,3516320," SC++ had STD and now it got AIDS."
3516320,3517840," So, yeah."
3521840,3523320," Uh, do I still have T?"
3523320,3525000," Yes, I do still have T."
3525000,3528220," Okay."
3528220,3534860," So, since, uh, we're using C++ and we can overload functions, I also like to do the following thing"
3534860,3542840," where I, um, define a template function, uh, that accepts a point of any type."
3543000,3551160," And if pointer is null pointer, right, we're also panicking, saying that there is an SDL error."
3551160,3554120," SDL get error."
3554120,3556200," SDL get error."
3556200,3558280," And then we return the pointer."
3560040,3560360," Okay."
3560360,3563560," So, uh, the next thing you need to do, I need to create a window."
3563560,3567540," Let me go to userincludeSDL."
3567540,3571620," And create a window."
3571620,3576520," So, where it is?"
3576520,3581560," Um, I'm pretty sure it's somewhere, it's somewhere here."
3581560,3582020," There we go."
3582020,3583620," Here's the function that creates the window."
3583620,3584420," Okay."
3584420,3585860," So, let's quickly create a window."
3588660,3593860," Uh, so, in this, I think, we'll, uh, create a window, believe it or not."
3593860,3595280," So, it's going to be window."
3595280,3598440," Um, it's going to be const."
3598440,3602240," And, of course, we want to check if everything is okay here."
3602240,3614300," So, the title is going to be, uh, uh, 3.jss and, uh, the position, the initial position is going to be what?"
3614300,3617360," Uh, well, I think we're going to just make it zero."
3617780,3618780," It's going to be zero, zero."
3618780,3620500," So, width and height."
3620500,3622160," Width and height is pretty interesting."
3622160,3628660," Um, so, let's say screen width and that one is going to be screen height."
3628660,3632680," So, and this is going to be the constant, the global constants."
3632680,3637280," Um, so, maybe I want to have some sort of a config."
3637280,3639040," Config.hp."
3639820,3641940," Right, where are we going to have this kind of stuff?"
3641940,3648140," So, it's going to be, uh, int, uh, screen, uh, width."
3648140,3651880," Uh, right."
3651880,3654240," So, like, compile time values."
3654240,3655800," Compile time values."
3655800,3658120," Uh, right."
3658120,3660500," And we're going to actually include this entire stuff."
3660600,3662100," So, it's going to be just config.hp."
3662100,3666980," So, I can go, uh, and then go here and just, you know, modify things around."
3666980,3671300," Um, all right."
3671300,3673540," And, uh, speaking of flags."
3673540,3674660," Speaking of flags."
3674660,3676220," So, what are the flags?"
3676220,3678920," Uh, flag."
3679100,3679740," Oh, shit."
3679740,3680820," I'm sorry."
3680820,3682680," So, window."
3682680,3685580," The only thing I want to have here is probably window resizable."
3685580,3686540," So, there we go."
3686540,3688060," Uh, cool."
3688060,3689600," And I don't even need to check anything."
3689600,3691500," It's going to be automatically checked by these two functions."
3691500,3691760," Cool."
3691760,3695000," So, let's see if all of that compiles."
3695000,3697000," Uh, maybe it's B."
3697000,3698800," Mm-hmm."
3698800,3700860," So, yeah."
3700860,3703000," Because it has to be height, of course."
3703000,3705660," And apart from that, it seems to be compiling."
3705660,3706680," Variable is not used."
3706680,3708620," That's exactly what we expected."
3708620,3708960," Cool."
3709100,3713960," Cool, cool, cool."
3713960,3715580," Um, yes."
3715580,3717860," So, what's going to be the next thing?"
3717860,3719740," We need to create the renderer afterwards."
3719740,3720320," Right."
3720320,3721800," So, we need to create the renderer."
3721800,3723360," Let me grab for it."
3723360,3725600," Grab rn."
3725600,3729520," Let's just, uh, create a renderer."
3729520,3730240," R-r-r-r-r."
3730240,3731560," My favorite."
3731560,3732400," My favorite function."
3732400,3733100," R-r-r-r."
3733100,3736940," So, let's put it here."
3736940,3738800," So, it's going to be yet another one."
3738800,3739900," Get another function here."
3739900,3743980," And there we go."
3743980,3745860," So, we have to provide the window itself."
3745860,3746720," Here's the window."
3746720,3751060," The index, I think it has to be minus one because the index of the driver."
3751860,3752980," And the flags."
3752980,3754580," Let's find the flags."
3754580,3755980," Here we are."
3755980,3760520," And the only thing I need to provide here is probably the accelerated."
3761240,3761780," Uh, yes."
3761780,3763540," It has to be accelerated in here."
3763540,3764780," There we go."
3764780,3770920," So, I also want to wrap all of that into sec to check if, uh, any errors that, uh, has happened."
3770920,3771680," And there we go."
3771680,3773400," Everything is okay."
3775400,3776840," Everything is okay."
3776840,3779920," So, what I'm thinking."
3779920,3781140," What I'm thinking."
3781140,3783840," We need to create probably the game already."
3783840,3784440," Right?"
3784440,3785820," So, we're going to have a structured game."
3785820,3791280," Um, and inside of the game, maybe I'm going to, like, literally store all of these things."
3791360,3793700," I'm going to store the pointer to SDL window."
3793700,3794760," Right?"
3794760,3796780," So, it's going to be a pointer to a window."
3796780,3798860," Then, we're going to have a renderer."
3798860,3800220," A renderer."
3800220,3802700," It's going to be also a renderer."
3802700,3804280," Uh, yeah."
3804280,3810800," And essentially, essentially, as I already mentioned, it could be just a global variable."
3810800,3811560," Like this."
3811560,3814040," So, it's going to be zero initialized completely."
3814040,3820560," And instead of doing these things around, let's actually straight up initialize games window"
3820560,3821900," and games renderer."
3821900,3824500," Uh, game renderer."
3824500,3825840," There we go."
3825840,3827620," So, yeah."
3827620,3830420," And in here, we'll have to use the games window."
3830420,3831780," Okay."
3831780,3832800," That's very interesting."
3832800,3836720," So, it goes, like, against, like, everything that was always thought."
3836720,3838740," But maybe that's whatever."
3838740,3839920," I mean, yeah."
3839920,3847880," Because I tried to apply all of these best practices that I learned for, like, a long time to make games."
3847880,3849700," And they absolutely flop."
3849760,3852260," They produce such a difficult-to-maintain code."
3852260,3856200," Uh, basically, this becomes the madness of passing arguments around."
3856200,3857860," And it's just, it's not helpful at all."
3860720,3871740," Um, and again, so, as somebody pointed out, I think these methods of, like, encapsulating and not having global variables don't even work in the enterprise environment."
3871740,3878340," Because even in that case, they have a database, which is a, which is a global thing."
3878340,3879780," It's like the Elm architecture."
3879780,3880260," Yeah."
3883300,3891860," Um, when you try to develop something more or less complex, uh, using, like, Elm approaches becomes really unbearable."
3895860,3901860," So, this is probably just, like, work on really small applications, but they don't scale."
3902300,3904120," Uh, they really, really don't scale."
3904120,3907080," Whatever is that word supposed to mean, right?"
3907140,3912460," Because the word scale was so overused, it doesn't really mean anything anymore, unfortunately."
3912460,3925560," So, uh, okay, and in the game, all right, we're probably gonna have a couple of, like, functions, uh, render, right, for, for the render time, uh, but the thing about render should modify the state of the game."
3925560,3930340," I think rendering could modify the state of the game, so that's why I'm gonna keep it like that."
3930340,3936380," So, then, we're gonna have a date, uh, which accepts delta time in seconds."
3936380,3941420," Uh, maybe I'm gonna literally just have it like that, seconds."
3942220,3943020," It's a struct."
3943020,3950140," No, looks like a class to me, do we have?"
3950140,3955100," Hmm, it's, it's definitely a class, yes, it's, it's a class."
3955100,3958700," Hello, Karin and Gunsan, welcome, welcome to the stream, how are we doing?"
3958700,3964780," Right, another thing, uh, we need to do, we need to also be able to handle events, uh, yes, it's a class."
3964780,3971740," Uh, Ayguduk is an expert in C++, so I actually trust him, he knows what he's talking about."
3971740,3972700," It's definitely a class."
3972700,3974940," It's definitely a class."
3974940,3984380," Okay, so, um, handle event, uh, handle event."
3988540,3993340," This dual event is gonna be pointed to an event, and there we go, so we're gonna have these things."
3993340,3998460," Uh, afterwards, uh, we want to organize the event loop."
3999580,4003980," All right, so, oh, the game also probably should have some sort of a state."
4003980,4006460," Uh, so what's gonna be the state of the game?"
4006460,4010620," Um, so right now, uh, I'm gonna just make it like a quit."
4010620,4016220," All right, so, and since the game is gonna be zero initialized, right?"
4017100,4022140," Uh, a quit is gonna be false by default, so then I can do something while game not quit."
4022140,4024540," Right, while game not quit, we're gonna be doing all this stuff."
4024540,4030140," So we'll need to have this structure in here, uh, which we probably want to zero initialize as well."
4030140,4036220," And while SDL poll event, uh, rolly poll in the event."
4036220,4042380," Uh, we're gonna be passing this stuff into the, uh, into the game."
4042380,4043740," So handle event, right?"
4043740,4044940," So it's gonna be handle event."
4044940,4045340," There we go."
4045340,4046140," Here's the event."
4046780,4050060," Uh, then do we wanna render the game?"
4050060,4052220," Guess."
4052220,4060380," Yeah, it should be just, you know, uh, game update."
4060380,4062540," And what's gonna be the delta time?"
4062540,4067500," Well, delta time, let's for now just make it constant, okay?"
4067500,4071820," So, uh, delta time, uh, let's call it update delta time."
4071820,4076700," So we're not gonna calculate it based on how much it took to calculate the frame or anything."
4076780,4078620," Let's just keep it like very simple."
4078620,4081340," And then we render everything, uh, right."
4081340,4084780," And then, uh, we might as well just delay."
4084780,4089980," So the, uh, update that the time should be in seconds, I think."
4089980,4090220," Right."
4090220,4092540," Uh, should be in seconds."
4092540,4093900," Maybe we're gonna call it CX."
4093900,4100460," Uh, and then update that the time is gonna be in milliseconds."
4100460,4100700," Right."
4100700,4102380," Uh, MS."
4102380,4103180," Cool."
4103180,4105100," So something like this."
4105820,4107580," Uh, I'm not quite sure."
4107580,4111500," Does SDL delay, uh, even, uh, fail?"
4111500,4112220," Let's find out."
4112220,4114620," Six."
4114620,4115740," Yes."
4115740,4119820," Mm."
4119820,4120860," Six fools."
4120860,4123180," All right."
4123180,4124140," So it's milliseconds."
4124140,4124460," Cool."
4124460,4128140," Uh, what's interesting is."
4130700,4135420," Uh, I wanna, I already use like seconds type and it has to be like a type depth."
4135420,4135820," Right."
4135820,4138060," Uh, it has to be something like type depth."
4138060,4141980," Um, let's define a type depth."
4141980,4146940," Or maybe I can just do using, using seconds is going to be equal to float."
4146940,4147340," Right."
4147340,4147340," Right."
4147340,4155660," So this is the seconds."
4159660,4173740," And the thing is, I wanna be able to use this kind of types in the config as well."
4173740,4193180," So maybe because of that, I'm going to introduce something like types HPP and this is where I'm going to put all of my types."
4194700,4198460," And then, uh, we can try to include those types in here."
4198460,4199260," Types HPP."
4199260,4200140," Yeah."
4200140,4204060," Because I need to do this update, uh, delta time sex."
4204060,4206860," And I want it to be part of the config."
4206860,4208140," But maybe it doesn't really matter."
4208140,4210860," Update time, uh, should be in seconds."
4210860,4211180," Right."
4211980,4217180," And it will greatly depend on, uh, whether, on the FPS."
4217180,4217420," Right."
4217420,4227100," So we need to take one and divide it by screen FPS, uh, which we should con, uh, convert to, to a fault."
4227100,4228540," Or maybe two seconds."
4228540,4233260," Eh, better to float because, yeah, something like this."
4233260,4235340," And, uh, what's going to be the screen FPS?"
4235340,4236540," What's going to be the screen FPS?"
4236540,4238780," The screen FPS is going to be actually 60."
4238780,4240220," So we're going to use 60 FPS."
4240780,4243500," But Zosin, I have a higher resolution screen."
4243500,4245180," How do I use that?"
4245180,4248780," Okay."
4248780,4250620," So now we need to have milliseconds."
4250620,4253660," And in case of milliseconds, it's going to be, uh, 32."
4253660,4257820," But maybe, uh, we should also introduce a type for milliseconds."
4257820,4262700," So it's going to be using milliseconds."
4262700,4265260," And let's call it just a mess then."
4267900,4270700," Uh, there's a little bit of inconsistency."
4270700,4270940," Yeah."
4270940,4272060," Let's call it milliseconds."
4272060,4273820," Uh, you, in 32."
4273820,4275420," So it's going to be in 32."
4275420,4279260," Um, milliseconds."
4279260,4284060," And it's going to be, essentially, you take this entire thing and multiply by 1000."
4284060,4286540," And, uh, yeah."
4286540,4292940," So I think after that, it only makes sense to just statically cast it to milliseconds."
4295020,4297500," Like this, so this is how we're going to do that."
4297500,4301180," This is how we're going to do all of that."
4301180,4301820," All right."
4301820,4303820," So is it going to compile afterwards?"
4303820,4305020," That's a good question."
4305020,4306300," That's a very good question."
4309500,4312780," Uh, so let's try to recompile this entire stuff."
4312780,4314620," Um, make."
4314620,4316140," Okay."
4316140,4319980," It didn't compile because we haven't used variables, but this is just warnings."
4319980,4322380," Uh, all right."
4322380,4324620," So yeah, a new experiment, it has to be this."
4324620,4326780," And there we go."
4326780,4328300," So almost first try."
4328300,4331260," I compiled this entire thing almost first try."
4331260,4332220," I think that's amazing."
4332220,4334940," In my opinion, it's a little bit amazing."
4334940,4345980," So, okay, so now we need to do some sort of a rendering."
4345980,4351420," Some sort of a rendering."
4351420,4351900," You know what?"
4351900,4354220," Like, why am I introducing these separate files?"
4354220,4356540," They don't make any sense."
4356540,4358780," Let's just, you know, put everything like this."
4358780,4360700," Like, I think I'm overcomputating anything."
4360700,4362060," Yes."
4362060,4370220," So I'm only going to start splitting, uh, into separate files when, uh, the code grows to,"
4370220,4371900," like, considerable size."
4371900,4373980," To a considerable size."
4373980,4377740," Apart from that, I don't think it makes sense to actually do that until we have that."
4377740,4380620," All right."
4380620,4383340," So now we need to do the rendering, chat."
4383340,4384460," Now we need to do the rendering."
4384460,4385580," How are we going to do the rendering?"
4388460,4396220," Uh, so we need to do sdl clear."
4396220,4397740," Yeah."
4397740,4402780," We need to clear thing, um, sdl clear screen."
4402780,4404060," I forgot how to do that."
4404060,4406060," It's something like render clear."
4406060,4406460," Yes."
4406460,4406940," Yes."
4406940,4407580," Render clear."
4407580,4412300," So, uh, sdl render clear."
4412300,4414700," And of course, this entire thing can fail."
4414700,4416460," And that's why we need to wrap it into that."
4417260,4418620," And we need to provide the renderer."
4418620,4420220," And we do have a renderer right here."
4420220,4422540," We don't, we don't even have to worry about that."
4422540,4423580," So here's the renderer."
4423580,4429980," And I think you also have to provide, uh, the render draw color, the render draw color."
4429980,4437180," Uh, and that's a little bit interesting because it accepts."
4437180,4437500," Yeah."
4437500,4439900," Uh, the time has come for our unpack macro."
4439900,4441260," Yeah."
4441260,4443340," And it also can fail by the way."
4443340,4446860," So we can provide the renderer."
4446860,4450220," And, uh, also we need to have a color."
4451500,4457980," So I'm thinking let's introduce, um, something like hex color."
4457980,4462860," Hex color, which is going to be uint 32, right?"
4462860,4469340," Uh, yeah."
4469340,4473100," So this is a hex color and it's uint 32."
4473100,4475420," How are we going to do all of that?"
4475420,4476460," That's a very good question."
4476460,4480380," So essentially what I want to have here, I want to have an unpack macro."
4480380,4487340," Uh, something like unpack hex color, uh, which accepts the color."
4487340,4492700," And then it uses the usual trick, um, with, with unpacking everything."
4492700,4498940," Uh, so then later we can have something like a const hex color."
4498940,4507900," Um, and, uh, say for example, background, uh, background color."
4507900,4511500," Background color."
4511500,4514380," So, and I can say something 18, 18, 18."
4514380,4518780," And there you go here is my color in, uh, basically in hex."
4518780,4523500," And maybe I can even, uh, say FF for, for the alpha."
4523500,4528940," So essentially what this unpack hex color will do, it will unpack the values from here."
4528940,4537660," So, uh, next we need to understand how to get the red, uh, the red color, right?"
4537660,4539020," So the red color is here."
4539020,4546460," So that means we have to, uh, shift three bytes and one byte is eight bits."
4546460,4547980," So basically we're shifting."
4547980,4552380," If we're shifting just eight, we're shifting only one byte, but we need to actually shift"
4552380,4552940," three of them."
4552940,4554700," So I'm going to multiply it by three."
4554700,4555100," You see?"
4555100,4562860," So, and that gives me like this value here, which I need to extract, uh, by masking it out"
4562860,4567100," with FF and that gives me the value, uh, of the, uh, of the red."
4567100,4573900," So, uh, after that, uh, I need to do the same, but for green and green just requires two bytes."
4573900,4575100," It requires just two bytes."
4575100,4581660," Uh, blue requires just one byte of shifting and alpha requires zero of them, right?"
4581660,4582620," So something like this."
4582620,4588060," So, and of course we need to escape all of these things to actually make it a real macro."
4588780,4590460," Otherwise it's not going to really work."
4590460,4592300," And here is unpack hex color."
4592300,4602300," So, uh, and now if I want to set this specific color, I can say unpack, uh, why is this Russian"
4602300,4606620," unpack hex color and I can say background color and there you go."
4606620,4612620," So the original signature of this function accepts four arguments here, but I'm actually providing"
4612620,4617740," two, uh, like a single argument and the four arguments are provided by this macro."
4617740,4622540," So macro takes the hexadecimal value of the integer, right?"
4622540,4626460," And then packs it into its components for you automatically."
4626460,4628060," So that's basically what we do here."
4628060,4631980," So it's a like basically paradigm that I often use on my streams."
4631980,4633340," And I think it's quite convenient."
4633340,4635900," Uh, yeah, does it make any sense?"
4635900,4640940," Maybe it makes some sense, but yeah, now I can just have like this as a hex color."
4640940,4642700," And as a, as well, you can look out."
4642700,4644780," Uh, I think it's quite cool."
4644780,4646140," I'm not sure."
4646140,4647740," It is actually."
4647740,4651340," This is something that I find pretty neat."
4651340,4654460," Uh, I personally find it pretty neat."
4654460,4659260," So after that, after we cleaned everything, we want to actually present this entire stuff."
4661500,4669100," So, and the question is SDL, uh, present is it, uh, can it fail?"
4669100,4671020," Yeah, it cannot fail."
4671020,4671900," It can never fail."
4671900,4672220," All right."
4673500,4675260," So that's pretty pogue."
4675260,4682540," And another thing that you probably, uh, need to check is switch event, uh, type."
4682540,4686460," And if it's case, SDL quit."
4686460,4686940," Yeah."
4686940,4688460," I also think it's a pretty cool trick."
4688460,4691900," And I actually came up with it accidentally."
4691900,4694780," Uh, I came up with it accidentally."
4694780,4700700," I was so fed up, like, you know, unpacking the cores to set them into this thing that I thought,"
4700700,4703180," like, I just want to abstract this pattern away."
4703180,4704220," Right."
4704220,4705740," I just want to strike this pattern away."
4705740,4708060," And then this idea came up."
4708060,4708300," Yeah."
4708300,4711420," I can just do that with macro because it's just basically repeating pattern."
4711420,4716380," And macros are quite good at, uh, you know, compressing the repeating patterns like that."
4716380,4719900," Um, and yeah, so I think it's pretty cool."
4719900,4724700," And what's interesting is that, by the way,"
4726540,4732140," uh, you can also define something like unpack SDL color, right?"
4732140,4733820," Where you accept color like that."
4733820,4735180," Look, look, look, look, look."
4735180,4738300," And, uh, so then you can do color R,"
4738300,4744380," color G, color B, color A, right?"
4744380,4750780," So, and what's funny is that now if, if you have a color as an SDL color, which is a structure,"
4750780,4754940," you can also use it with this function by just switching hex with SDL."
4754940,4760220," And basically you, you change the way you unpack the colors for these functions,"
4760220,4760700," right?"
4760700,4762940," And you can actually represent colors however you want."
4762940,4767100," you just for each way of representation, you, you create different unpacking macro."
4767100,4769100," This is so cool."
4769100,4772300," Like the more I think about it, it's actually the more I like it."
4772300,4773900," It's a, it's a fucking genius idea."
4773900,4779020," Is that a divine intellect?"
4779020,4779820," I think it is."
4779820,4783420," Add color functions to AIDS."
4783420,4787100," I'm not sure if it's going to be that useful."
4788380,4789500," Uh, all right."
4789500,4792780," So yeah, here's a quit and stuff like that."
4792780,4794940," So, and then I can just do something quit true."
4794940,4798380," I'm going, we don't need to update much."
4798380,4801580," So yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
4801580,4804540," So let's actually see if it's, if it works or not."
4804540,4805980," So we're going to rebuild everything."
4805980,4809980," And, uh, now I should be able to just run this entire thing."
4809980,4813180," And it should give me the, um, the window."
4813180,4817260," But cool thing is that now I can set the color here to FF."
4817260,4818940," and it should become completely red."
4818940,4823900," Yep."
4823900,4824460," Now it's red."
4824460,4827180," I'm really sorry if it was too bright, but yeah, it actually works."
4827180,4832300," So I can use like hex colors and just unpack them and unpack them and set them"
4832300,4833420," and so on and so forth."
4833420,4835180," All right."
4835180,4837740," And in the future, I can actually have more of different colors."
4837740,4840780," But for now, it's going to be just, uh, this kind of background."
4843100,4843900," All right."
4843900,4847740," So what's going to be the next thing?"
4847740,4849020," What's going to be the next thing?"
4849020,4854780," The next thing is probably going to be, um, introducing some sort of a player, right?"
4854780,4856060," Introducing some sort of a player."
4856060,4857900," And I'm not sure how I'm going to introduce the player."
4860220,4864540," Um, yeah, it could be some sort of a rectangle."
4864540,4867580," Uh, so, oh yeah."
4867580,4872940," So if we're going to start like doing some math, we need to introduce a vector to like 2d vector and whatnot."
4873660,4874780," So, yeah."
4874780,4882460," Uh, I want to make a cup of tea before we're going to go into introducing math vector."
4882460,4886940," Does anyone have any questions while I'm making a cup of tea?"
4886940,4889100," Any questions?"
4898060,4900140," I'm drinking Earl Grey today, by the way."
4900140,4903420," If anyone is interested, of course."
4903420,4907100," So, yeah."
4907100,4908300," Feel free to ask a question."
4908300,4910460," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
4910460,4911900," Sodium Pog indeed."
4911900,4913020," Finally, Earl Grey."
4913020,4917260," Earl Grey is very nice."
4917260,4921420," Very Bergamot-y."
4921420,4922460," Very citrusy."
4922460,4923980," Because Bergamot is a citrus."
4926860,4928140," The Earl of JS."
4928140,4930060," Maybe."
4930060,4930860," I don't know what that means."
4930860,4931580," But, yeah."
4931580,4932700," Close the thinner, by the way."
4932700,4933180," Close the wall."
4933180,4936940," What will this game be like?"
4936940,4937820," I have no idea."
4937820,4943020," Like, I just want to develop some relatively more or less complex game."
4943020,4947340," Around maybe 500 lines of code or maybe more."
4947340,4949820," Like up 1000 lines."
4949820,4955820," Because I think like 1000 lines of code is pretty complex enough to see interesting patterns"
4955820,4960860," emerging and then using different compression techniques to compress those patterns."
4960860,4961900," If you know what I mean."
4961900,4962620," Because, yeah."
4962620,4964540," 1000 lines is not that big of a game."
4964540,4969420," But it's big enough for complexity to emerge a little bit."
4969420,4971420," To show itself a little bit."
4974460,4981500," You can probably call it unrolling."
4981500,4983100," You can probably call it unrolling."
4983100,4985900," But I personally call it unpacking."
4985900,4986380," Right."
4986380,4987500," So, yeah."
4987500,4988620," I call it unpack."
4988620,4993260," Similarly to how C++ variadic templates call them unpacking."
4993260,5002780," Because in C++ 17 you have these variadic template packs and the operation of unpacking them."
5002780,5008300," So, by analogy, I think it makes more sense for me to call this unpack operation."
5008300,5009980," But, yeah."
5009980,5011260," You can call it whatever you want."
5011260,5011900," Maybe unrolling."
5011900,5012540," Maybe unrolling."
5012540,5018140," All righty."
5018140,5020540," So, I'm going to go to the kitchen and quickly turn on the kettle."
5020540,5021660," All right."
5021660,5024780," And maybe I also want to refill my bottle."
5024780,5025340," You know what?"
5025340,5028140," Let's make a cup like a small break."
5028700,5031740," I think a small break is going to be very appreciated by myself."
5031740,5033980," All right."
5033980,5036300," So, it's going to be a small break."
5036300,5038780," And I should probably use my templates."
5038780,5041820," So, let's put three minutes."
5041820,5043180," I think three minutes should be enough."
5043180,5045660," Three minutes should be enough."
5045660,5046700," And, yeah."
5046700,5046940," Okay."
5046940,5048940," Let's make a small break, boys and girls."
5048940,5049740," And you guys have fun."
5058700,5060700," I think three minutes should be enough."

5244740,5245740," Hello."
5245740,5246740," Welcome."
5246740,5250740," How are everyone's in?"
5250740,5252740," Welcome, welcome, welcome."
5252740,5256740," So let's do something."
5256740,5258740," Let's introduce some stuff."
5258740,5261740," So maybe it's going to be some sort of like a grid-based game."
5261740,5266740," Hello, beat 69 train."
5266740,5267740," Welcome, welcome, welcome."
5267740,5268740," Welcome, welcome, welcome."
5268740,5272740," Something to, like, easy to implement."
5272740,5276780," Something that doesn't require physics or anything like that."
5276780,5278780," You know, something like grid-based should be."
5278780,5279780," Okay."
5279780,5281780," Okay, by the way, my kettle is ready."
5281780,5282780," Just a second."
5282780,5284780," I'm going to quickly pour, like, a cup of water"
5284780,5285780," and then I'm going to be back."
5285780,5286780," It's not going to be even a minute."
5286780,5287780," Seriously."
5287780,5289780," I'm very sorry."
5289780,5311820," I'm going to be back."
5311820,5312860," I'm fucking coming."
5312860,5313860," I'm back."
5313860,5314860," I'm coming."
5314860,5315860," I'm coming."
5315860,5316860," I'm coming."
5316860,5317860," I'm coming."
5317860,5318860," I'm coming."
5318860,5319860," I'm back."
5319860,5320860," The samovar is ready."
5320860,5321900," Okay."
5321900,5322900," The samovar is ready."
5322900,5323900," All right."
5323900,5324900," Okay."
5324900,5325900," Mm-hmm."
5325900,5326900," Cool."
5326900,5331940," So, since it's going to be sort of like a grid-based, right?"
5331940,5332940," It's going to be grid-based."
5332940,5333940," It's going to be grid-based."
5333940,5337940," Maybe it makes sense to introduce some sort of, like, a tile size."
5337940,5338940," All right."
5338940,5339940," You know what I mean?"
5339940,5340940," Oh, wait, wait, wait."
5340940,5343940," Before we go for the tile sizes, I want you to have vectors and shit."
5343940,5344940," All right."
5344940,5347940," So, I want you to introduce a vector class."
5347940,5348940," Let's quickly introduce it."
5348940,5351940," So, it's going to be vector2."
5351940,5354940," And it's going to be just a structure that..."
5354940,5357940," I think it has to be a templated one."
5357940,5359940," I think it has to be a templated one."
5359940,5365940," Because quite often, I need to have vectors of both floats and integers."
5365940,5372940," And especially in a grid-based game, I'm going to have type for a coordinate of a single cell."
5372940,5376940," And the type for coordinate, like, in absolute space."
5376940,5377940," Right."
5377940,5380940," So, it's quite often I have something like that."
5380940,5381940," Right."
5381940,5383940," And I want them to be incompatible, actually."
5383940,5384940," So, that's quite important."
5384940,5386940," So, this one is going to be x and y."
5386940,5388940," And there we go."
5388940,5393940," So, maybe it would make sense to introduce some sort of a constructor for them."
5393940,5396940," Like, v2, t, x, t, y."
5396940,5399940," Specifically, just to construct these kind of things."
5399940,5402940," You know what I mean?"
5402940,5403940," Mmm."
5403940,5406940," So, then I should be able to do things like that."
5406940,5408940," 69 for 20."
5408940,5410940," And I wonder..."
5410940,5412940," I wonder if it's going to work like that."
5412940,5418940," I think the type of the class is not derived in the constructors, is it?"
5418940,5420940," I don't quite remember."
5420940,5421940," Is that a thing?"
5421940,5422940," Does anyone know?"
5422940,5425940," If I try to just do something like this."
5425940,5426940," Something like this."
5426940,5427940," Okay."
5427940,5428940," It does compile."
5428940,5430940," And now, in the main..."
5430940,5436940," What if I try to create auto, position, vector 2, 69, 420."
5436940,5440940," Will it be able to defer types correctly?"
5440940,5441940," To infer, I mean."
5441940,5442940," Okay."
5442940,5443940," It managed to infer types."
5443940,5444940," Okay."
5444940,5445940," It managed to infer types."
5445940,5446940," So, that's cool."
5446940,5447940," Okay."
5447940,5450940," Can I print the type?"
5450940,5455940," Is there any way for me to get the type of the thing?"
5455940,5457940," So, C++ type decal, I think."
5457940,5458940," I think that's what it is."
5458940,5460940," Yeah, decal type."
5460940,5463940," And then I want to take the name of the type."
5463940,5467940," In specs, the declare type of the entity of the type."
5467940,5468940," Well, I could go with the expression."
5468940,5469940," Yeah, decal type."
5469940,5472940," So, can I do decal type?"
5472940,5473940," Position X."
5473940,5477940," And then something like C++ type ID."
5477940,5480940," And what does it return?"
5480940,5482940," Does type ID return sister?"
5482940,5485940," Okay."
5485940,5489940," So, type info must be included using type ID."
5501940,5502940," Mm-hmm."
5502940,5502940," Mm-hmm."
5502940,5503940," Type info."
5503940,5504940," So, it returns type info, right?"
5504940,5505940," It returns type info."
5505940,5506940," Then you can take a name."
5506940,5507940," And name is what?"
5507940,5508940," Name is constr."
5508940,5509940," Okay."
5509940,5510940," So, that's cool."
5510940,5511940," Uh-huh."
5511940,5512940," So, let's quickly include."
5512940,5513940," Because I'm really curious."
5513940,5514940," Type info."
5514940,5515940," Right."
5515940,5516940," Type info."
5516940,5517940," Right."
5517940,5517940," Type info."
5517940,5517940," Right."
5517940,5518940," Type info."
5518940,5519940," Hello."
5519940,5520940," A-A-N-G-K-Y-K-S."
5520940,5521940," Hello."
5521940,5522940," Okay."
5522940,5523940," So, type ID."
5523940,5524940," Uh-huh."
5524940,5524940," And all of this is actually the keywords."
5524940,5525940," Uh-huh."
5525940,5526940," And then we'll go print alone."
5526940,5526940," Then we're gonna just do like that."
5526940,5527940," And let's actually see what's the type of view of this thing."
5527940,5528940," a new parameter."
5528940,5529940," So, what was that?"
5529940,5530940," Uh-huh."
5530940,5531940," Yeah."
5531940,5532940," I have to do something like std out."
5532940,5533940," Okay."
5533940,5534940," Okay."
5534940,5535940," So, type ID."
5535940,5536940," Uh-huh."
5536940,5537940," Right."
5537940,5538940," Type info."
5538940,5539940," Type info."
5539940,5540940," Hello."
5540940,5541940," A-A-N-G-K-Y-K-S."
5541940,5541940," Hello."
5541940,5542940," Okay."
5542940,5543940," So, type ID."
5543940,5544940," Uh-huh."
5544940,5545940," And all of this is actually the keywords."
5545940,5546940," Uh-huh."
5546940,5547940," And then we'll go print alone."
5547940,5548940," Then we're gonna just do like that."
5548940,5552940," And let's actually see what's the type of view of this thing."
5552940,5553940," A new parameter."
5553940,5554940," So, what was that?"
5554940,5555940," Uh-huh."
5555940,5556940," Yeah."
5556940,5559940," So, it should be able to do that."
5559940,5561940," And it's i."
5561940,5562940," Okay."
5562940,5563940," It just returns it i."
5563940,5565940," I returned i."
5565940,5566940," That's a very..."
5566940,5568940," That's not really useful."
5568940,5569940," Uh-huh."
5569940,5573940," I was hoping that in GCC, type ID is gonna be like a full name."
5573940,5575940," But I mean, it's compiler-dependent."
5575940,5578940," As far as I know, type IDs are compiler-dependent."
5578940,5579940," Right."
5579940,5582940," I return the value which is identical for the same type."
5582940,5583940," Yeah."
5583940,5585940," But I suppose i is for integer, right?"
5585940,5588940," If I try to do something like that, it's probably gonna be just F."
5588940,5589940," Right."
5589940,5591940," So, it's gonna be just F."
5591940,5592940," Oh, it's just D."
5592940,5593940," It's probably because it's double."
5593940,5596940," And if I put F in here, it's gonna be F."
5596940,5597940," Okay."
5597940,5598940," So, that makes sense."
5598940,5599940," Cool."
5599940,5601940," So, apparently it can differ from the constants."
5601940,5607940," I don't know why I thought it cannot infer the types in the constructors."
5607940,5609940," But I guess it can do that."
5609940,5610940," So, that's perfect."
5610940,5612940," So, I'm totally okay with that."
5612940,5614940," All right."
5614940,5620940," See, I remember thinking too about C++."
5620940,5621940," I guess."
5621940,5623940," I'm not 100% sure."
5623940,5624940," But, yeah."
5624940,5625940," Cool."
5625940,5629940," Wait a sec."
5629940,5630940," Wait a sec."
5630940,5632940," I just realized."
5632940,5635940," What's the definition of SDLColor?"
5635940,5648940," The size of SDLColor is exactly 32 bits."
5648940,5653940," ""If I reinterpret SDLColor as Uint32, will this work?"""
5653940,5655940," So, that's a good question."
5655940,5659940," That's a very good question."
5659940,5661940," Because, essentially, I..."
5661940,5662940," Yeah."
5662940,5668940," 32-bit integer could be also a structure with 4 bytes."
5668940,5669940," And..."
5669940,5672940," Maybe I'm just doing extra work."
5672940,5677940," ""Have you done any 3D programming ever?"""
5677940,5678940," Well, ever, yes."
5678940,5679940," So, yeah."
5679940,5694940," I wrote my first 3D program when I was in high school."
5694940,5695940," Which was..."
5695940,5702940," So, it's eight."
5702940,5704940," I graduated eight years ago."
5705940,5706940," Then five years."
5706940,5707940," Yeah."
5707940,5712940," So, I basically wrote my first 3D program 13 years ago."
5712940,5715940," And I didn't use OpenGL."
5715940,5718940," I actually did software rendering."
5718940,5726940," So, essentially, I just rendered and rasterized triangles myself pixel by pixel on CPU."
5726940,5733940," And I made a small, little game with spaceships, you know, moving towards you."
5733940,5735940," And you have to shoot them in 3D."
5735940,5736940," It was hella fun."
5736940,5737940," Yes."
5737940,5738940," Yeah."
5738940,5741940," I did a 3D and I did it even without OpenGL."
5741940,5742940," Can you believe that?"
5747940,5748940," Oh, alright."
5748940,5748940," Alright."
5748940,5750940," So, let's pour a cup of tea."
5750940,5754940," Oh, and by the way, I did that in Delphi."
5754940,5755940," Yes."
5755940,5761940," I did that in Delphi, which is like a Pascal dialect or something."
5761940,5762940," Yeah."
5762940,5762940," No, that's a proper B-Boomer shit."
5762940,5762940," I gotta tell you."
5762940,5764940," Imagine writing 3D games in Delphi without OpenGL software."
5764940,5765940," Rasterizer and shit."
5765940,5765940," So, yeah, that's what I did."
5765940,5766940," So, yeah, that's what I did."
5766940,5767940," Oh, and by the way, and I did that in Delphi."
5767940,5768940," Oh, and by the way, and I did that in Delphi."
5768940,5769940," Yes."
5769940,5774940," I did it in Delphi, which is like a Pascal dialect or something."
5774940,5775940," Yeah."
5775940,5777940," No, that's a proper B-Boomer shit."
5777940,5778940," I gotta tell you."
5778940,5792940," Imagine writing 3D games in Delphi without OpenGL software rasterizer and shit."
5792940,5793940," So, yeah, that's what I did."
5793940,5794940," Holy shit, I'm old."
5794940,5795940," Yeah."
5795940,5796940," Nice."
5796940,5797940," Nice."
5797940,5798940," Nice."
5798940,5799940," Nice."
5799940,5800940," Nice."
5800940,5801940," Nice."
5801940,5802940," Nice."
5802940,5803940," Let's continue."
5803940,5804940," So, what I was doing..."
5804940,5805940," Oh, yeah, I was implementing this shit."
5805940,5806940," Cool."
5806940,5808940," So, and I also probably wanna, like, overload some operators."
5808940,5809940," I probably wanna have an operator plus."
5809940,5810940," Right."
5810940,5810940," Which returns a new thing in here."
5810940,5810940," And accepts vector2, I'm gonna call it that."
5810940,5810940," So, essentially, what I expect from this thing is to construct a new vector."
5810940,5811940," Right."
5811940,5812940," Right."
5812940,5813940," this x plus that x."
5813940,5814940," This x plus that x."
5814940,5815940," this y plus that x."
5815940,5816940," this y plus that y."
5816940,5817940," Right."
5817940,5818940," something like this."
5818940,5819940," something like this."
5819940,5820940," So, we're also gonna..."
5820940,5821940," duplicate this."
5821940,5821940," So, we're also gonna duplicate this..."
5821940,5821940," This x plus that x."
5821940,5821940," This y plus that y."
5821940,5822940," Something like this."
5822940,5823940," So, we're also gonna duplicate this."
5823940,5824940," Right."
5824940,5825940," So, we're also gonna duplicate this."
5825940,5826940," So, we're gonna have an operator plus."
5826940,5827940," Right."
5827940,5828940," Which returns a new thing in here."
5828940,5829940," And accepts vector2."
5829940,5830940," I'm gonna call it that."
5830940,5831940," So, essentially, what I expect from this thing is to construct a new vector."
5831940,5832940," Right."
5832940,5833940," this x plus that x."
5833940,5834940," This x plus that x."
5834940,5835940," This y plus that y."
5835940,5836940," Right."
5836940,5837940," Something like this."
5837940,5839940," So, we're also gonna duplicate this stuff for minuses."
5839940,5840940," Now, we have subtraction."
5840940,5841940," I think it's gonna work."
5841940,5842940," If I make it like a method."
5842940,5843940," I think it should work."
5843940,5844940," If I remember correctly."
5844940,5845940," So, we're also gonna duplicate this stuff for minuses."
5845940,5846940," Now, we have subtraction."
5846940,5847940," I think it's gonna work."
5847940,5848940," If I make it like a method."
5848940,5849940," I think it should work."
5849940,5850940," If I remember correctly."
5850940,5851940," So, we also probably need something like a method."
5851940,5852940," I think it's gonna work."
5852940,5853940," If I make it like a method."
5853940,5854940," I think it's gonna work."
5854940,5855940," If I make it like a method."
5855940,5856940," I think it should work."
5856940,5857940," If I remember correctly."
5857940,5862940," So, we also probably need something like length."
5862940,5866940," But length is not gonna really work that easily."
5866940,5867940," Right."
5867940,5870940," Unless we have some sort of a specialization."
5870940,5873940," So, it has to be flowed some shit."
5873940,5886940," Also, let me actually move them outside of the structure."
5886940,5887940," I don't really feel comfortable."
5887940,5888940," I don't really feel comfortable."
5888940,5889940," Having them inside of the structure."
5889940,5890940," I don't really feel comfortable."
5890940,5891940," I don't really feel comfortable."
5891940,5892940," I don't really feel comfortable."
5892940,5893940," Having them inside of the structure."
5893940,5894940," And this one is gonna be just."
5894940,5895940," Something like."
5895940,5896940," A."
5896940,5897940," A."
5897940,5899940," This is gonna be something like this."
5899940,5900940," So, this is gonna be."
5900940,5901940," A."
5901940,5902940," And that is gonna be."
5902940,5903940," A."
5903940,5904940," And that is gonna be."
5904940,5905940," A."
5905940,5906940," And that is gonna be."
5906940,5907940," A."
5907940,5908940," This is gonna be."
5908940,5909940," A."
5909940,5910940," And that is gonna be."
5910940,5911940," A."
5911940,5912940," And that is gonna be."
5912940,5913940," A."
5913940,5914940," And that is gonna be."
5914940,5915940," A."
5915940,5916940," And that is gonna be."
5916940,5917940," Cool."
5917940,5918940," And here's the thing."
5918940,5919940," A."
5919940,5920940," A."
5920940,5921940," That's struct."
5921940,5922940," V1."
5922940,5923940," Zool."
5923940,5924940," Yes."
5924940,5925940," That's a good idea."
5925940,5926940," A."
5926940,5927940," I wanna have something like length."
5927940,5928940," Right."
5928940,5929940," But length."
5929940,5930940," Will require square root."
5930940,5931940," And square root."
5931940,5932940," Is only for."
5932940,5933940," Floats."
5933940,5934940," So, because of that."
5934940,5935940," I think we're gonna overload."
5935940,5936940," This entire thing."
5936940,5937940," So, we're gonna have."
5937940,5938940," Deactor to float."
5938940,5939940," Uh."
5939940,5940940," Actually."
5940940,5941940," Like return float."
5941940,5942940," And."
5942940,5943940," Uh."
5943940,5944940," We're gonna do it like that."
5944940,5945940," So."
5945940,5946940," So, it's gonna be."
5946940,5947940," Uh."
5947940,5948940," Take a square."
5948940,5950940," And take a square of y."
5950940,5951940," And do."
5951940,5952940," S."
5952940,5953940," SQRTF."
5953940,5954940," SQRTF."
5954940,5955940," SQRTF."
5955940,5956940," SQRTF."
5956940,5957940," Uh."
5957940,5958940," Right."
5958940,5959940," SQRTF."
5959940,5960940," Uh."
5960940,5963940," And we'll have to return this entire thing."
5963940,5964940," Yeah."
5964940,5965940," Yeah."
5965940,5966940," Yeah."
5966940,5967940," Uh."
5967940,5968940," Cool."
5968940,5969940," Now."
5969940,5972940," I also wanna have a version for double."
5972940,5973940," Just in case."
5973940,5974940," And for double."
5974940,5975940," We have something like this."
5975940,5976940," Let's go."
5976940,5980940," And."
5980940,5981940," Also."
5981940,5983940," I wanna be able to normalize the vector."
5983940,5985940," I wanna be able to normalize the vector."
5985940,5986940," Uh."
5986940,5988940," But to normalize the vector."
5988940,5991940," So, for example."
5991940,5992940," I."
5992940,5993940," If I have like."
5993940,5994940," An integer vector."
5994940,5995940," Right."
5995940,5996940," If I have an integer vector."
5996940,5997940," Um."
5997940,5998940," I wanna be able to."
5998940,5999940," Normalize it to."
5999940,6000940," Um."
6000940,6003940," Either float or double."
6003940,6005940," Depending on what you want."
6005940,6006940," Right."
6006940,6007940," So that means."
6007940,6008940," I need to be able to cast."
6008940,6009940," The types."
6009940,6010940," Within."
6010940,6011940," The."
6011940,6012940," Uh."
6012940,6013940," Integers."
6013940,6014940," If you know what I mean."
6014940,6015940," So."
6015940,6016940," Uh."
6016940,6017940," What if we have something like."
6017940,6018940," Template."
6018940,6019940," Uh."
6019940,6020940," Type name."
6020940,6021940," You."
6021940,6022940," Right."
6022940,6023940," And."
6023940,6024940," Essentially."
6024940,6025940," What we do here."
6025940,6026940," Uh."
6026940,6027940," We implement."
6027940,6028940," V2."
6028940,6029940," You."
6029940,6030940," And."
6030940,6031940," What it essentially does."
6031940,6032940," It just constructs."
6032940,6033940," The other."
6033940,6034940," The vector in here."
6034940,6035940," Um."
6035940,6036940," And."
6036940,6037940," Just statically."
6037940,6038940," Casts."
6038940,6039940," Them."
6039940,6040940," All."
6040940,6041940," To."
6041940,6042940," Your type."
6042940,6043940," To your."
6043940,6044940," Desire type."
6044940,6045940," So we don't have to do."
6045940,6046940," That yourself."
6046940,6047940," So that's pretty useful."
6047940,6048940," And."
6048940,6049940," The reason why I wanna do that."
6049940,6050940," So you're."
6050940,6051940," Doing normalization."
6051940,6052940," Right."
6052940,6053940," Norm."
6053940,6054940," Normalize."
6054940,6055940," Uh."
6055940,6056940," Normalize."
6056940,6057940," Uh."
6057940,6058940," Normalize."
6058940,6059940," So you accept."
6059940,6060940," A vector."
6060940,6061940," Of some certain type."
6061940,6062940," Right."
6062940,6063940," Uh."
6063940,6064940," Template."
6064940,6065940," Type name."
6065940,6066940," T."
6066940,6067940," So."
6067940,6068940," And."
6068940,6069940," For example."
6069940,6070940," You wanna."
6070940,6071940," Return float."
6071940,6072940," So to be able to do that."
6072940,6073940," We take."
6073940,6074940," This thing."
6074940,6075940," We cast it."
6075940,6076940," To float."
6076940,6077940," Right."
6077940,6078940," And then."
6078940,6079940," We're."
6079940,6080940," Uh."
6080940,6081940," Calculating the length of everything."
6081940,6082940," Uh."
6082940,6083940," We'll calculate the length of it."
6083940,6084940," And."
6084940,6085940," Uh."
6085940,6088940," Then divide each component by."
6088940,6089940," Uh."
6089940,6090940," By that."
6090940,6091940," So it's gonna be outer."
6091940,6092940," B."
6092940,6093940," Uh."
6093940,6094940," Then."
6094940,6095940," We need to have a length."
6095940,6096940," Which is."
6096940,6097940," B."
6097940,6098940," Um."
6098940,6099940," Yeah."
6099940,6100940," Just literally."
6100940,6101940," Length."
6101940,6102940," Length."
6102940,6103940," Length."
6103940,6104940," Of B."
6104940,6105940," And then."
6105940,6106940," We return."
6106940,6107940," B2."
6107940,6108940," Bx."
6108940,6109940," Divided by L."
6109940,6110940," And."
6110940,6111940," By."
6111940,6112940," Divided by L."
6112940,6113940," Right."
6113940,6114940," And this is a version for floats."
6114940,6115940," And you can always."
6115940,6116940," Uh."
6116940,6117940," Create a version for doubles."
6117940,6118940," If you want to."
6118940,6119940," Uh."
6119940,6120940," There we go."
6120940,6121940," So that's how it works."
6121940,6122940," So if you have an integer vector."
6122940,6123940," If you try to normalize it."
6123940,6124940," You can always choose between."
6124940,6125940," The."
6125940,6126940," Uh."
6126940,6127940," Resulting."
6127940,6128940," Oh."
6128940,6129940," Yeah."
6129940,6130940," This."
6130940,6131940," Because normalization requires."
6131940,6132940," Like."
6132940,6133940," Division."
6133940,6134940," And."
6134940,6135940," Length."
6135940,6136940," And so on."
6136940,6137940," And so forth."
6137940,6138940," Uh."
6138940,6139940," So."
6139940,6140940," Yeah."
6140940,6141940," So that's why."
6141940,6142940," Implementive."
6142940,6143940," Does it make sense?"
6143940,6144940," Does any of this make sense?"
6144940,6145940," Um."
6145940,6145940," So."
6145940,6146940," All of that is needed to."
6146940,6147940," Preserve."
6147940,6148940," Like."
6148940,6149940," Static typeness."
6149940,6149940," And."
6149940,6150940," Strictness."
6150940,6151940," And stuff like that."
6151940,6153940," Hopefully that makes sense."
6153940,6154940," Uh."
6154940,6155940," Uh."
6155940,6160940," Maybe we can even squash this entire thing."
6160940,6161940," Because."
6161940,6162940," Uh."
6162940,6163940," Length."
6163940,6164940," Can be only for these two types."
6164940,6165940," Right."
6165940,6165940," Length."
6165940,6166940," Can be only for these two types."
6166940,6167940," And."
6167940,6168940," That means."
6168940,6169940," Uh."
6169940,6169940," Maybe."
6169940,6170940," I can just make this."
6170940,6171940," As you."
6171940,6172940," Right."
6172940,6173940," And."
6173940,6175940," Just keep it like that."
6175940,6176940," Because."
6176940,6177940," If you try to."
6177940,6178940," You know."
6178940,6180940," Use a different kind of type in here."
6180940,6181940," Uh."
6181940,6183940," It's not gonna work out anyway."
6183940,6184940," So."
6184940,6185940," Because."
6185940,6186940," There's no length."
6186940,6187940," For that specific type."
6187940,6188940," So."
6188940,6189940," I'm not sure."
6189940,6190940," How many problems."
6190940,6191940," I'm gonna have."
6191940,6192940," Because of that."
6192940,6193940," But."
6193940,6194940," Uh."
6194940,6195940," So."
6195940,6196940," This is the whole set."
6196940,6197940," That I wanna have."
6197940,6198940," And that set."
6198940,6199940," Is usually enough."
6199940,6200940," Except."
6200940,6201940," We need to be able to scale."
6201940,6202940," The vector."
6202940,6203940," We need to be able to scale."
6203940,6204940," The vectors."
6204940,6205940," Uh."
6205940,6206940," What's the easiest way."
6206940,6207940," To scale a vector."
6207940,6208940," Uh."
6208940,6209940," Well."
6209940,6210940," Let's."
6210940,6211940," Let's quickly do that."
6211940,6212940," Um."
6212940,6213940," Yeah."
6213940,6216940," Let's implement the scaling."
6216940,6217940," So."
6217940,6218940," We have."
6218940,6219940," A."
6219940,6220940," And."
6220940,6221940," Then."
6221940,6222940," You."
6222940,6223940," Also."
6223940,6224940," Use."
6224940,6225940," S."
6225940,6226940," And."
6226940,6227940," Essentially."
6227940,6228940," Uh."
6228940,6229940," Let's put it this way."
6229940,6230940," Uh."
6230940,6231940," We're gonna multiply it by."
6231940,6232940," S."
6232940,6233940," Right."
6233940,6234940," And this has to be."
6234940,6235940," This thing."
6235940,6236940," And I also wanna be able to do that."
6236940,6237940," Reorder."
6237940,6238940," So."
6238940,6239940," I also gonna reorder."
6239940,6240940," Uh."
6240940,6241940," This entire thing."
6241940,6242940," Like this."
6242940,6243940," Uh."
6243940,6244940," Um."
6244940,6249940," Can you use copy constructor."
6249940,6250940," Instead of cast."
6250940,6251940," To."
6251940,6252940," Uh."
6252940,6254940," Does copy constructor."
6254940,6255940," Convert."
6255940,6256940," The types."
6256940,6257940," Um."
6257940,6258940," Does it convert them?"
6258940,6259940," Hmm."
6259940,6260940," I think it's gonna be complicated."
6260940,6261940," I don't wanna go into that."
6261940,6262940," Uh."
6262940,6275320," I think it's going to be complicated, I don't want to go into that."
6275320,6279700," So basically you'll have to have a templated copy constructor."
6279700,6287500," Oof, oof, oof, no, I'm not even sure if it's going to be possible, it's outside of this"
6287500,6288500," copy."
6288500,6289500," Whatever."
6289500,6294680," Okay, so I think I have a bare minimum of what I need here."
6294680,6307060," Okay, so this one has to be a template, of course."
6307060,6319060," And of course, uh-huh, uh-huh, so what else do we have here?"
6319060,6324240," Do you have to do something like type name?"
6324240,6332280," No, no, no, type name."
6332280,6334240," How do I pass it there?"
6334240,6336240," Does anyone know?"
6336240,6338240," This is actually very sad."
6338240,6343420," C++ makes me sad."
6343420,6344420," Um..."
6344420,6345420," I forgot how to do that."
6345420,6349420," Does anyone remember?"
6349420,6352600," Um, okay."
6352600,6353600," Um..."
6353600,6354600," Okay."
6354600,6357600," C++ templates..."
6357600,6358600," Um..."
6358600,6361640," Template compilation error."
6361640,6363640," Yeah, chat, why are you dead?"
6363640,6365400," Uh, okay."
6365400,6366600," So..."
6366600,6367800," Yeah, templates."
6367800,6368480," I found it."
6368600,6375280," I found it, so you do it like that."
6375280,6379960," Welcome to C++, madafuckaaaaa."
6379960,6388460," Ah, classic."
6388460,6390460," Ah..."
6390460,6392460," Is it really that hard to parse this shit?"
6392460,6407640," Oh, yeah, that's some C++ for you, I guess."
6407640,6414140," Basically, it cannot understand that I'm trying to, like, instantiate, like, a class, like,"
6414140,6416820," a method in here, so it needs to, like, a hint."
6416820,6417820," Uh..."
6417820,6418820," Alright."
6418820,6419820," Uh..."
6419820,6420820," Oh, boy."
6420820,6421820," Oh, boy."
6421820,6422820," Oh, boy."
6422820,6423820," Oh, boy."
6423820,6424820," Where is my soy?"
6424820,6425820," Uh-huh."
6425820,6426820," Uh..."
6426820,6427820," So..."
6427820,6430820," Yeah, I finally have all of this shit."
6430820,6431820," Cool, cool, cool."
6431820,6432820," Uh..."
6432820,6433820," So, since it's gonna be tile..."
6433820,6434820," Uh..."
6434820,6435820," Like..."
6435820,6436820," Grid-based, right?"
6436820,6437820," It's gonna be grid-based."
6437820,6438820," Uh..."
6438820,6440820," So, I need to introduce something like const..."
6440820,6441820," Uh..."
6441820,6442820," Float tile size."
6442820,6444820," We're gonna have a single tile size."
6444820,6445820," Uh..."
6445820,6446820," 69..."
6446820,6447820," Uh..."
6447820,6451820," Do you like coding in CPP?"
6451820,6456820," CPP is kinda limited in what it can do."
6456820,6457820," Right."
6457820,6458820," Right."
6458820,6459820," So..."
6459820,6460820," C preprocessor."
6460820,6461820," Right."
6461820,6462820," So..."
6462820,6463820," C preprocessor."
6463820,6464820," Right."
6464820,6467820," So, it's not even Turing complete, actually."
6467820,6468820," So..."
6468820,6469820," Like..."
6469820,6471820," I'm not sure if you can call it..."
6471820,6472820," Programming?"
6472820,6473820," Right."
6473820,6477820," Because it's not even Turing complete."
6477820,6481820," It's kinda cool for some particular situations, but..."
6481820,6483820," Programming in CPP..."
6483820,6484820," Nah..."
6484820,6487820," It cannot even do recursion."
6487820,6488820," Um..."
6488820,6490820," It's only useful for..."
6490820,6491820," Uh..."
6491820,6494820," Conditional compilations and just, you know, in..."
6494820,6495820," Uh..."
6495820,6497820," Including all the files together."
6497820,6498820," So..."
6498820,6499820," That's apart from that."
6499820,6500820," I didn't think it's that great."
6500820,6501820," Um..."
6501820,6502820," Yeah."
6502820,6507820," Anyways."
6507820,6508820," Um..."
6508820,6509820," Uh..."
6509820,6510820," What do we got?"
6510820,6511820," Uh..."
6511820,6512820," So, here's the tile size."
6512820,6514820," And the tile size is this."
6514820,6515820," Uh..."
6515820,6516820," Okay."
6516820,6517820," So, here's the question."
6517820,6518820," Um..."
6518820,6531820," Let's also introduce something like..."
6531820,6532820," Camera."
6532820,6533820," Uh..."
6533820,6534820," Uh..."
6534820,6535820," Shigiman."
6535820,6536820," Hello."
6536820,6537820," Welcome."
6537820,6538820," Uh..."
6538820,6539820," So, it's gonna be..."
6539820,6540820," Camera."
6540820,6543820," So, the camera is going to have a position."
6543820,6544820," Right?"
6544820,6546820," So, it's gonna be a position in float."
6546820,6547820," Um..."
6547820,6550820," To be fair, maybe I wanna have some sort of, like, a type."
6550820,6552820," Um..."
6552820,6557820," Uh..."
6557820,6558820," Position."
6558820,6559820," And, uh..."
6559820,6562820," Probably we're gonna have a velocity of some sort as well."
6562820,6564820," So, let's make it velocity."
6564820,6565820," And, uh..."
6565820,6567820," Essentially, uh..."
6567820,6570820," We don't need to render anything, but we do need to update things."
6570820,6573820," So, it's gonna be in seconds DT."
6573820,6576820," Um..."
6576820,6578820," Do we need anything else for the camera?"
6578820,6582820," So, the camera should be also able to map certain, uh..."
6582820,6584820," Things to screen."
6584820,6585820," Right?"
6585820,6587820," It can accept a point."
6587820,6588820," Oh my god!"
6588820,6590820," Niroku!"
6590820,6593820," Thank you so much for a tier one subscription."
6593820,6594820," Your first subscription, by the way."
6594820,6595820," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
6595820,6599820," And welcome to our epic game development club."
6599820,6600820," How about that?"
6600820,6601820," Cheers!"
6602820,6603820," Nice!"
6603820,6604820," Nice!"
6604820,6605820," Finally!"
6605820,6606820," I have..."
6606820,6608820," I will have something to eat this month."
6608820,6609820," Alright!"
6609820,6611820," So, we need to have, like, two screen."
6611820,6613820," And, uh..."
6613820,6614820," Also, I need to have two world."
6614820,6615820," Right."
6615820,6618820," So..."
6618820,6619820," And surprisingly enough."
6619820,6620820," Surprisingly enough."
6620820,6621820," Surprisingly enough."
6621820,6623820," Mmm..."
6625820,6626820," I need to be able to..."
6626820,6628820," Know the size of the win."
6628820,6629820," Oh my god!"
6629820,6632820," Cyan Swinney subscribe with Twitch Prime."
6632820,6633820," Thank you!"
6633820,6634820," So..."
6634820,6635820," What is going on today?"
6635820,6636820," First..."
6636820,6637820," First time, by the way."
6637820,6638820," First..."
6638820,6639820," First subscriptions."
6639820,6640820," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
6640820,6642820," Welcome to our epic game development club!"
6642820,6646820," I'm not a professional game developer, but I kinda like game development, I think."
6646820,6647820," I think it's kinda cool."
6647820,6648820," Uh..."
6648820,6649820," Thank you so much."
6649820,6650820," Cheers!"
6650820,6651820," Hmm..."
6651820,6652820," Interesting."
6652820,6653820," Um..."
6653820,6654820," Alrighty."
6654820,6656820," So, we need to know the width and height of the window."
6656820,6660820," So, we need to know the width and height of the window."
6660820,6664820," The question is, where can we get the width and height of the window?"
6664820,6668820," As they'll get the size of the window."
6668820,6669820," Hmm..."
6669820,6670820," Get window size."
6670820,6672820," So, we can just literally use that."
6672820,6673820," Uh..."
6673820,6674820," Surprisingly enough."
6674820,6675820," Uh..."
6675820,6677820," What we can do here."
6677820,6678820," Um..."
6678820,6680820," To get the size of the window, right?"
6680820,6681820," Uh..."
6681820,6684820," To get the size of the window, right?"
6684820,6685820," Uh..."
6685820,6686820," To get the size of the window."
6686820,6688820," We need to..."
6688820,6689820," Uh..."
6689820,6691820," Have the instance of the window."
6691820,6692820," Uh..."
6692820,6694820," But the window..."
6694820,6696820," Is located within the game."
6696820,6697820," Right, so..."
6697820,6698820," That means..."
6698820,6700820," You should be able to just do game window."
6700820,6701820," Like this."
6701820,6702820," There we go."
6702820,6705820," Uh..."
6705820,6706820," Yeah."
6706820,6707820," And it kinda even makes sense."
6707820,6708820," If you think about it."
6708820,6709820," Mm-hmm."
6709820,6712820," Furthermore, I think it would be even cooler."
6712820,6713820," If..."
6713820,6714820," Within the game itself."
6714820,6715820," Right."
6715820,6716820," You have a method."
6716820,6717820," Something like..."
6717820,6718820," V2..."
6718820,6719820," Uh..."
6719820,6720820," Int..."
6720820,6721820," Uh..."
6721820,6722820," Window size."
6722820,6723820," Right."
6723820,6724820," Uh..."
6724820,6725820," Window size."
6725820,6727820," And essentially what it will do..."
6727820,6729820," Unfortunately, we won't be able to make it const."
6729820,6730820," Right."
6730820,6731820," Because it..."
6731820,6733820," Needs a non-const pointer to the window."
6733820,6734820," Right."
6734820,6735820," So..."
6735820,6736820," Uh..."
6736820,6737820," Like that."
6737820,6738820," And..."
6738820,6739820," SDL."
6739820,6740820," Get..."
6740820,6741820," Uh..."
6741820,6742820," Window size."
6742820,6743820," Window."
6743820,6744820," W."
6744820,6745820," H."
6745820,6747820," And then we can return V2."
6747820,6748820," W."
6748820,6749820," H."
6749820,6750820," So we have..."
6750820,6751820," We can have the size as..."
6751820,6752820," The vector."
6752820,6754820," So it's a little bit easier for us to..."
6754820,6755820," Do any..."
6755820,6756820," Uh..."
6756820,6757820," Modifications with it."
6757820,6758820," Uh..."
6758820,6761820," Do any modifications."
6761820,6762820," So..."
6762820,6763820," Yeah."
6763820,6764820," Now..."
6764820,6766820," Um..."
6766820,6767820," I can do game."
6767820,6768820," Uh..."
6768820,6769820," Maybe game."
6769820,6770820," Window size."
6770820,6771820," Window size."
6771820,6772820," Uh..."
6772820,6775820," And for example, I wanna take half of the window size."
6775820,6777820," I can multiply this entire thing by half."
6777820,6778820," Uh..."
6778820,6781820," Well, to be fair, window size is an integer."
6781820,6782820," So maybe at first I wanna do..."
6782820,6784820," I wanna cast it to float."
6784820,6786820," So I'm gonna be casting it to float."
6786820,6789820," And then I'm gonna be scaling it to 0.5."
6789820,6790820," So..."
6790820,6791820," That's pretty cool."
6791820,6793820," So we can take the window size."
6793820,6796820," And then you can cast it to whatever type you want."
6796820,6797820," So..."
6797820,6799820," In my opinion, it's pretty cool."
6799820,6800820," Mmm..."
6800820,6801820," I think it's kinda cool."
6801820,6802820," Alright."
6802820,6803820," So..."
6803820,6805820," Let me think how we're gonna map to the screen."
6805820,6806820," Alright."
6806820,6807820," So..."
6807820,6808820," Uh..."
6808820,6809820," We have this point."
6809820,6810820," Uh..."
6810820,6811820," Right."
6811820,6813820," And the position of the camera is actually positive."
6813820,6814820," The position of the camera is positive."
6814820,6821820," So that means you take the point and you subtract the position from it."
6821820,6823820," And this is how you map it to the screen."
6823820,6824820," Uh..."
6824820,6827820," But on top of that, you have to add..."
6827820,6828820," Right."
6828820,6832820," You have to add half of the screen."
6832820,6833820," Uh..."
6833820,6834820," You have to add half of the screen."
6834820,6835820," Uh..."
6835820,6836820," To come..."
6836820,6840820," To actually make the camera align to the center."
6840820,6841820," Right."
6841820,6842820," You have a point."
6842820,6843820," You subtract the position of the camera."
6843820,6845820," And you add half of the screen."
6845820,6846820," Um..."
6846820,6847820," Right."
6847820,6848820," So..."
6848820,6849820," And to map all of that to the world."
6849820,6850820," Right."
6850820,6851820," You have a point, uh..."
6851820,6852820," In the screen."
6852820,6853820," And you need to map it back to the world."
6853820,6854820," And it's quite important."
6854820,6855820," Especially for clicks."
6855820,6856820," Because you have..."
6856820,6857820," Uh..."
6857820,6858820," Mouse position."
6858820,6859820," Which is the screen coordinates."
6859820,6861820," And you need to be able to convert them to the world coordinates."
6861820,6862820," Right."
6862820,6863820," So..."
6863820,6864820," To do that, we have to do the opposite."
6864820,6866820," We have to subtract half of the window size."
6866820,6867820," Uh..."
6867820,6868820," Half of the window size."
6868820,6871820," And..."
6871820,6872820," Uh..."
6872820,6874820," Add the position of the camera."
6874820,6875820," There we go."
6875820,6876820," So now we have a camera."
6876820,6877820," And..."
6877820,6878820," Uh..."
6878820,6880820," We can map between screen and world using this camera."
6880820,6881820," And this is actually pretty convenient."
6881820,6884820," And all of that depends on the size of the window."
6884820,6885820," So..."
6885820,6886820," Yeah."
6886820,6887820," That's pretty cool."
6887820,6888820," Uh..."
6888820,6889820," Another thing."
6889820,6890820," So..."
6890820,6891820," Uh..."
6891820,6892820," Camera should be also..."
6892820,6893820," Able to..."
6893820,6894820," Um..."
6894820,6895820," Update itself."
6895820,6896820," Right."
6896820,6897820," So..."
6897820,6898820," Uh..."
6898820,6900820," Position plus velocity multiplied by delta t."
6900820,6901820," So..."
6901820,6903820," But we don't have plus equals for the vectors."
6903820,6905820," And that will be actually super convenient in my opinion."
6905820,6907820," So let's quickly implement that."
6907820,6908820," So..."
6908820,6911820," Where is going to be the plus?"
6911820,6912820," Um..."
6912820,6914820," So in that case, it's going to be template."
6914820,6915820," Tem..."
6915820,6916820," Type 9t."
6916820,6917820," Vector 2t."
6917820,6919820," Operator plus equals."
6919820,6920820," Uh..."
6920820,6923820," So this one has to be a reference."
6923820,6926820," And this one has to be just a regular thing in here."
6926820,6927820," And..."
6927820,6929820," I think essentially how you do that."
6929820,6930820," You just do it like that."
6930820,6931820," Right."
6931820,6932820," And then you just do it like this."
6932820,6933820," And listen to..."
6933820,6934820," I think..."
6934820,6935820," I..."
6935820,6936820," Think should return..."
6936820,6937820," A back."
6937820,6939820," But it should return it as a reference."
6939820,6941820," If you remember correctly."
6941820,6942820," Uh..."
6942820,6943820," Hello, Tieng."
6943820,6944820," H&H."
6944820,6945820," Welcome to the stream."
6945820,6946820," Works, by the way."
6946820,6947820," What's that?"
6947820,6948820," Is that a free BSD thing?"
6948820,6949820," Did you build your..."
6949820,6950820," Uh..."
6950820,6951820," BSD it again?"
6951820,6952820," Uh..."
6952820,6953820," Well..."
6953820,6954820," It works."
6954820,6955820," But it's horrible."
6955820,6956820," I mean..."
6956820,6957820," So..."
6957820,6958820," Is that what the viewer suggested?"
6958820,6959820," This is horrible."
6959820,6960820," But it's pretty cool that you can make it work."
6960820,6961820," So..."
6961820,6962820," Nah."
6962820,6963820," Nah."
6963820,6964820," Nah."
6964820,6965820," Nah."
6965820,6966820," Sorry."
6966820,6967820," ShiggyMan."
6967820,6968820," ShiggyMan."
6968820,6970820," Thank you so much for two months of Twitch Prime subscription."
6970820,6971820," Pok."
6971820,6972820," Pok indeed."
6972820,6973820," Thank you."
6973820,6974820," Thank you."
6974820,6975820," Thank you."
6975820,6976820," Thank you."
6976820,6977820," And..."
6977820,6978820," Welcome."
6978820,6979820," To Epic Game Development Club."
6979820,6980820," Of course it is horrible."
6980820,6981820," Yeah."
6981820,6982820," But..."
6982820,6983820," It works, but it's horrible."
6983820,6984820," It works, but it's horrible."
6984820,6985820," I mean..."
6985820,6986820," So..."
6986820,6987820," Is that what the viewer suggested?"
6987820,6988820," This is horrible."
6988820,6989820," But it's pretty cool that you can make it work."
6989820,6990820," So..."
6990820,6991820," Nah."
6991820,6992820," Nah."
6992820,6993820," Sorry."
6993820,6994820," Uh..."
6994820,6995820," ShiggyMan."
6995820,6996820," Thank you so much for two months of Twitch Prime subscription."
6996820,6999820," It's kinda cool as a recreational exercise."
6999820,7000820," So..."
7000820,7001820," Yeah."
7001820,7002820," Uh..."
7002820,7005820," It's pretty cool."
7005820,7007820," It's pretty cool."
7007820,7008820," Uh..."
7008820,7009820," Alright."
7009820,7010820," So..."
7010820,7011820," It's actually kinda noisy."
7011820,7014820," Like, even such small templates are a little bit noisy to me."
7014820,7016820," I don't know why."
7016820,7017820," Uh..."
7017820,7018820," Uh..."
7018820,7019820," Alright."
7019820,7021820," So we have a little bit of a compilation errors."
7021820,7023820," So this is not a compilation error."
7023820,7024820," Uh..."
7024820,7025820," Unused variable."
7025820,7026820," Okay."
7026820,7027820," Game was not..."
7027820,7028820," Okay."
7028820,7029820," That's very interesting."
7029820,7031820," So we have a little bit of the..."
7031820,7032820," Uh..."
7032820,7034820," Referential..."
7034820,7035820," Things going on."
7035820,7037820," Which is not particularly great."
7037820,7040820," So if I move this thing here..."
7040820,7041820," Uh..."
7041820,7043820," I'm not able to..."
7043820,7044820," Actually define it."
7044820,7046820," Because the game is defined later."
7046820,7047820," Oof..."
7047820,7048820," Oof..."
7048820,7049820," Oof..."
7049820,7050820," Oof..."
7050820,7051820," Oof..."
7051820,7052820," Oof..."
7052820,7053820," So that means I have to forward declare struct."
7053820,7054820," So I have to forward declare it."
7054820,7055820," But I still..."
7055820,7056820," I cannot forward declare the actual value."
7056820,7058820," So that means I have to store this thing by..."
7058820,7059820," Uh..."
7059820,7060820," Uh..."
7060820,7061820," Like a pointer and whatnot."
7061820,7062820," Right."
7062820,7063820," So it's initially going to be null PTR."
7063820,7064820," Um..."
7064820,7065820," So that means..."
7065820,7066820," Later..."
7066820,7069820," I have to allocate it somewhere."
7069820,7070820," For example..."
7070820,7071820," On the dynamic memory."
7071820,7072820," So I have to do something like game."
7072820,7073820," A new game."
7073820,7074820," And..."
7074820,7076820," Hopefully that will actually zero initialize it."
7076820,7077820," And only then..."
7077820,7078820," Uh..."
7078820,7079820," I should be able to..."
7079820,7080820," You know..."
7080820,7081820," Initialize everything else."
7081820,7082820," Hello."
7082820,7083820," R-I-M-A..."
7083820,7084820," Rima."
7084820,7086820," I hope I pronounced your nickname correctly."
7086820,7087820," Welcome."
7087820,7088820," Welcome to the stream."
7088820,7090820," Welcome to our game development stream."
7090820,7091820," So..."
7091820,7092820," Uh..."
7092820,7093820," Yeah."
7093820,7094820," And then here..."
7094820,7095820," I have to actually..."
7095820,7096820," Uh..."
7096820,7097820," Reference it by..."
7097820,7098820," Uh..."
7098820,7099820," Pointer."
7099820,7100820," So maybe I can..."
7100820,7101820," Like this."
7101820,7102820," And..."
7102820,7103820," Like this."
7103820,7104820," Yeah."
7104820,7107820," Hopefully that's gonna work."
7107820,7109820," Alrighty."
7109820,7110820," And..."
7110820,7111820," Uh..."
7111820,7112820," What else do we have here?"
7112820,7113820," Uh..."
7113820,7114820," Could not convert int..."
7114820,7115820," Oh my god."
7115820,7116820," This is even more horrible."
7116820,7118820," Wait a second."
7118820,7120820," From int to float."
7120820,7121820," Oh."
7121820,7123820," That's very interesting."
7123820,7125820," So you cannot..."
7125820,7128820," Statically cast int to float?"
7128820,7129820," Um..."
7129820,7130820," Hello Miles."
7130820,7131820," Glorious."
7131820,7132820," Sus."
7132820,7133820," Welcome to the stream."
7133820,7134820," Wait."
7134820,7135820," You cannot statically cast them?"
7135820,7136820," Really?"
7136820,7137820," Um..."
7137820,7138820," Um..."
7138820,7139820," Mm..."
7139820,7141820," So let me..."
7141820,7142820," Let me actually see."
7142820,7143820," I..."
7143820,7144820," I cannot believe that."
7144820,7145820," Uh..."
7145820,7146820," Probe."
7146820,7147820," Cpp."
7147820,7148820," I cannot believe that."
7148820,7149820," Uh..."
7149820,7150820," Probe."
7150820,7151820," Cpp."
7151820,7153820," So I'm pretty sure you should be able to."
7153820,7154820," Like you have a float."
7154820,7155820," X."
7155820,7156820," 69."
7156820,7157820," 69."
7157820,7158820," F."
7158820,7159820," And then I say Y."
7159820,7161820," And I do static cast."
7161820,7162820," Uh..."
7162820,7163820," Uh..."
7163820,7165820," Was it actually from float to int or from..."
7165820,7166820," Okay."
7166820,7167820," From int to float."
7167820,7168820," Alright."
7168820,7169820," So it's gonna be..."
7169820,7170820," Int."
7170820,7173820," Or maybe I'm actually doing something incorrectly."
7173820,7174820," From int to float."
7174820,7175820," So it's gonna be float."
7175820,7176820," And..."
7176820,7179820," I'm pretty sure it should be possible to do something like that."
7179820,7181820," But it doesn't really allow me."
7181820,7182820," Uh..."
7182820,7183820," Uh..."
7183820,7184820," Probe."
7184820,7185820," Yeah."
7185820,7186820," I think..."
7186820,7187820," I think I'm misunderstanding it."
7187820,7188820," So..."
7188820,7189820," This is huge misunderstanding."
7189820,7190820," Uh..."
7190820,7191820," Misunderstanding."
7191820,7194820," Uh..."
7194820,7195820," Alright."
7195820,7196820," So..."
7196820,7197820," Let's..."
7197820,7198820," Go."
7198820,7212820," Where exactly it's happening?"
7214820,7215820," Uh..."
7215820,7216820," Window size."
7216820,7217820," Cast 2."
7217820,7218820," Could not convert."
7218820,7219820," Uh..."
7219820,7221820," Why exactly can..."
7221820,7223820," Can you not convert it?"
7223820,7224820," So..."
7224820,7225820," U is a float."
7225820,7226820," And T is..."
7226820,7227820," Is that."
7227820,7228820," So apparently..."
7228820,7231820," This cast thing also doesn't work somehow."
7231820,7234820," Hmm..."
7234820,7236820," So maybe I also have to specify..."
7236820,7238820," This thing here."
7238820,7240820," Maybe that's what you want."
7240820,7241820," Oh!"
7241820,7242820," Yeah, yeah."
7242820,7243820," Wait a second."
7243820,7245820," It could be because by v2..."
7245820,7247820," It means it's own constructor."
7247820,7252820," So maybe you have to specify explicitly that you mean a different constructor."
7252820,7258820," What a useful error message!"
7258820,7261820," How on earth are you supposed to guess..."
7261820,7262820," Oh my god."
7262820,7265820," This is such a trash error message."
7266820,7276820," It has nothing to do with the actual problem."
7276820,7278820," Seriously, it has nothing to do with the actual problem."
7278820,7279820," Oh my god."
7279820,7281820," Condemn it, mate."
7285820,7286820," Nice."
7286820,7289820," So we have a camera and shit."
7289820,7290820," So I'm..."
7290820,7291820," I'm happy."
7291820,7292820," More or less."
7292820,7293820," GCC please."
7293820,7294820," Yes."
7294820,7295820," Exactly."
7295820,7296820," Exactly."
7296820,7297820," Ah!"
7297820,7298820," Fuck."
7300820,7301820," I wonder how..."
7301820,7301820," Um..."
7301820,7306820," How expensive this operation is."
7306820,7310820," Does it do like a very difficult query?"
7310820,7311820," Like..."
7311820,7312820," Heavy query."
7312820,7313820," Difficult."
7313820,7314820," Uh..."
7314820,7316820," I want to take a look at the source code of the SDL."
7316820,7317820," Um..."
7317820,7319820," Just to see what exactly this function does."
7319820,7320820," Um..."
7320820,7322820," Because I'm not sure if it's too heavy."
7322820,7325820," So let's actually do a grep rn."
7325820,7328820," Let's find some of the implementations of this function."
7328820,7329820," Uh..."
7329820,7331820," If it does have any implementations."
7331820,7332820," Okay."
7332820,7339820," It literally just goes inside of the structure and extracts..."
7339820,7341820," Can I do that myself?"
7341820,7342820," Okay."
7342820,7344820," Can I just do that myself?"
7344820,7345820," Seriously."
7345820,7346820," Um..."
7346820,7347820," So..."
7347820,7348820," If I find..."
7348820,7349820," Yeah."
7349820,7350820," Yeah."
7350820,7351820," So..."
7351820,7353820," Let me go to compilation."
7353820,7354820," And..."
7354820,7356820," I'm gonna try to find a window."
7356820,7357820," And..."
7357820,7361820," I think I have to search specifically for something like that."
7361820,7362820," Uh..."
7362820,7363820," Uh..."
7363820,7366820," Where is the window?"
7366820,7368820," I didn't see SDL window."
7368820,7369820," Uh..."
7369820,7371820," Do I have to do it like that?"
7371820,7372820," Oh shit!"
7372820,7373820," Okay."
7373820,7375820," SDL window..."
7379820,7380820," Was it SDL window?"
7380820,7381820," What's..."
7381820,7382820," What's the type of this thing?"
7382820,7385820," SDL window?"
7385820,7387820," I just..."
7387820,7388820," I'm..."
7388820,7389820," I'm brain farting so hard right now."
7389820,7390820," Yes."
7390820,7391820," It is SDL window."
7391820,7392820," But why can't I find it?"
7392820,7393820," Alright."
7393820,7394820," So..."
7394820,7395820," Um..."
7395820,7397820," SDL window."
7397820,7399820," Ah..."
7399820,7400820," I see."
7400820,7402820," So..."
7402820,7404820," And where is the definition of SDL window?"
7404820,7405820," Uh..."
7405820,7406820," Okay."
7406820,7407820," Let's try to find this thing."
7407820,7408820," Uh..."
7408820,7409820," Struct."
7409820,7410820," SDL window."
7410820,7411820," Uh..."
7411820,7412820," Where is it defined?"
7412820,7413820," Uh..."
7413820,7414820," Uh..."
7414820,7415820," Uh..."
7415820,7416820," Does it have..."
7416820,7418820," Uh..."
7418820,7419820," Uh..."
7419820,7420820," Uh..."
7420820,7421820," Uh..."
7421820,7422820," Uh..."
7422820,7423820," I think I found it."
7423820,7424820," Uh..."
7424820,7425820," It depends actually on..."
7425820,7426820," Uh..."
7426820,7427820," Video driver."
7427820,7428820," Right?"
7428820,7430820," Or just GL driver."
7430820,7431820," Okay."
7431820,7432820," Whatever."
7432820,7433820," Um..."
7433820,7437820," So let me find all of these things."
7437820,7440820," Uh..."
7440820,7441820," Yes."
7441820,7443820," Oh!"
7443820,7444820," And depending on the..."
7444820,7445820," On the driver."
7445820,7447820," This entire thing is gonna be just different."
7447820,7449820," It could be..."
7449820,7450820," Yeah."
7450820,7451820," I think it's..."
7451820,7452820," It's better to not to touch internal things."
7452820,7453820," Yeah."
7453820,7454820," It's better not to touch them."
7454820,7457820," So that's why we have to access them through this function."
7457820,7459820," And that function is probably not that expensive."
7459820,7461820," So we just extract the value out."
7461820,7463820," I don't know this thing."
7463820,7466820," I don't really know why I worry about it that much."
7466820,7467820," Um..."
7467820,7468820," So..."
7468820,7469820," The thing is..."
7469820,7474820," Now..."
7474820,7475820," Um..."
7475820,7476820," I wanna render the whole game."
7476820,7477820," But I also wanna render, like, grid."
7477820,7478820," Right?"
7478820,7480820," I wanna be able to render grid."
7480820,7483820," With different random colors and whatnot."
7486820,7489820," With different random colors."
7489820,7494820," And how can we have a random color for a very specific..."
7494820,7497820," For a very specific thing."
7497820,7501820," Oh."
7501820,7502820," Okay."
7508820,7509820," So..."
7509820,7509820," So..."
7509820,7510820," Let's go to the..."
7510820,7511820," Uh..."
7511820,7512820," Struct game."
7512820,7513820," Uh..."
7513820,7514820," Struct game."
7514820,7516820," Uh..."
7516820,7517820," Struct game."
7517820,7519820," So here's the render."
7519820,7520820," So..."
7520820,7521820," Essentially..."
7521820,7522820," Essentially..."
7522820,7524820," Essentially..."
7524820,7525820," I wanna set..."
7525820,7526820," Uh..."
7526820,7527820," Uh..."
7527820,7528820," Uh..."
7528820,7529820," Uh..."
7529820,7530820," The game."
7530820,7531820," Camera."
7531820,7532820," Velocity."
7532820,7533820," To be..."
7533820,7534820," Um..."
7534820,7535820," Something like..."
7535820,7536820," V2."
7536820,7537820," Uh..."
7537820,7538820," Minus..."
7538820,7539820," 1F."
7539820,7540820," Minus..."
7540820,7540820," Uh..."
7540820,7541820," 1F."
7541820,7541820," Right?"
7541820,7543820," So it's basically gonna go in..."
7543820,7544820," By diagonal."
7544820,7545820," Right?"
7545820,7546820," It's gonna be..."
7546820,7547820," It's gonna slowly go by diagonal."
7547820,7549820," We wanna make it a little bit faster."
7549820,7550820," Like..."
7550820,7551820," 10."
7551820,7552820," Right?"
7552820,7553820," Okay."
7553820,7555820," We wanna make it a little bit faster."
7555820,7556820," And..."
7556820,7557820," Uh..."
7557820,7558820," Yeah."
7558820,7559820," So essentially now..."
7559820,7560820," If I wanna render everything."
7560820,7562820," I need to know what..."
7562820,7563820," Uh..."
7563820,7564820," Tiles I need to render."
7564820,7566820," So that's the main problem."
7566820,7568820," I need to know what tiles I need to render."
7568820,7569820," But to..."
7569820,7570820," To do that."
7570820,7571820," I also need to know..."
7571820,7572820," Uh..."
7572820,7574820," The actual rectangle."
7574820,7576820," The actual rectangle."
7576820,7577820," Of the camera."
7577820,7578820," And the rectangle of the camera."
7578820,7580820," Also depends on the..."
7580820,7581820," Um..."
7581820,7582820," On the size of the window."
7582820,7583820," And what not."
7583820,7584820," Uh..."
7584820,7585820," Uh..."
7585820,7586820," Uh..."
7586820,7587820," Uh..."
7587820,7587820," Uh..."
7587820,7588820," Uh..."
7588820,7589820," Uh..."
7589820,7589820," Uh..."
7589820,7590820," Uh..."
7590820,7591820," Uh..."
7591820,7592820," Uh..."
7592820,7593820," Uh..."
7593820,7594820," Uh..."
7594820,7595820," Uh..."
7595820,7596820," Uh..."
7596820,7597820," Uh..."
7597820,7597820," So..."
7597820,7599820," Let me try to draw everything."
7599820,7600820," Right."
7600820,7601820," Uh..."
7601820,7602820," Uh..."
7602820,7603820," Uh..."
7603820,7604820," Uh..."
7604820,7605820," Uh..."
7605820,7620500," Maybe I'm overcomplicating everything but probably not."
7620500,7631940," To be fair, alright, so essentially if you have this rectangle as a camera, so here is"
7631940,7639580," your camera and you know the left top corner and the bottom right corner."
7639580,7649880," So you can easily detect this tile, you can easily detect this tile and you can easily"
7649880,7659320," detect this tile, and these two tiles give you the range of the tile coordinates that"
7659320,7663880," you have to basically render, and that should be it."
7663880,7670320," So the only thing you need to do is to be able to easily get that rectangle of the camera."
7670320,7673920," Right, you just need to be able to easily get that rectangle of the camera."
7673920,7677700," And the question is how can you do that easily?"
7677700,7686260," So it would be kind of nice if the camera just had a function that returns a rectangle."
7686260,7688700," Something like this."
7688700,7689700," ViewRect."
7689700,7690700," Right."
7690700,7695260," And essentially what it does, it just gives you a rectangle, but the question is what is"
7695260,7696260," a rectangle?"
7696260,7697260," Yeah, that's three."
7697260,7698260," Welcome to the stream."
7698260,7699260," Welcome to the stream."
7699260,7700260," So you have a position."
7700260,7703260," So we also need to know the window size."
7703260,7704260," Right."
7704260,7707260," So you do game window size and that gives you that."
7707260,7709260," Then you can try to cast that to the float."
7709260,7710260," And there you go."
7710260,7712820," We have a window size in floats."
7712820,7713820," Cool."
7713820,7717820," So we can keep that size in here somewhere."
7717820,7719820," So we'll keep it here."
7719820,7721820," So here's the size."
7721820,7729820," Afterwards, so the beginning of the rectangle is going to be essentially the position of the"
7729820,7733820," camera minus half of this size."
7733820,7734820," So that's what it is."
7734820,7737820," So this is the beginning of the rectangle."
7737820,7740820," And the size of the rectangle is the size of the window."
7740820,7741820," Essentially."
7741820,7742820," Essentially."
7742820,7747820," So, and you basically need to construct a rectangle out of that."
7747820,7749820," You just construct the rectangle out of that."
7749820,7750820," And there you go."
7750820,7755820," So, but you need to, we need to define the, the type of the rectangle somehow."
7755820,7760820," We need to define the type of the rectangle."
7760820,7761820," All right."
7761820,7763820," So let me see, let me see."
7763820,7765820," So here is the vector."
7765820,7767820," Here's the vector sheet."
7767820,7770820," And let's define something like structure."
7770820,7771820," Right."
7771820,7779820," So it's going to be a vector to template type 90."
7779820,7782820," So this one is the position of the vector."
7782820,7783820," Right."
7783820,7785820," And this one is the size of the, of the rectangle."
7785820,7786820," Right."
7786820,7789820," And of course you might want to have a constructor here."
7789820,7790820," Are you using any game engine."
7790820,7790820," Depends on the definition of the game engine."
7790820,7791820," I use SDL2."
7791820,7792820," Does it count as a game engine?"
7792820,7793820," All right."
7793820,7794820," So this is what we're going to have here."
7794820,7806820," And that will make it easy for us to do all of that."
7806820,7807820," Hmm."
7807820,7808820," Hmm."
7808820,7809820," Cool."
7809820,7810820," So let's see if it compiles."
7810820,7812820," Uh, this is not how we compile it."
7812820,7813820," Uh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep."
7813820,7814820," It does not compile."
7814820,7815820," Let's try to figure out why."
7815820,7816820," Uh, so size."
7816820,7817820," No operator multiply."
7817820,7818820," Oh, oh, this is because yeah."
7818820,7819820," I used, I can, I cast it to float, but now it's a completely different thing."
7819820,7820820," Okay."
7820820,7821820," So, and in here."
7821820,7822820," Uh, this is because yeah, I used, I can, I cast it to float, but now it's a completely different."
7822820,7823820," Okay."
7823820,7824820," So, and in here."
7824820,7841820," Uh, this is because yeah, I used, I can, I cast it to float, but now it's a completely different."
7841820,7842820," Okay."
7842820,7843820," So, and in here."
7843820,7845820," Uh, this is because yeah, I used, I can, I cast it to float, but now it's a completely different."
7845820,7846820," Okay."
7846820,7852820," And in here, um, uh, game has no member named camera."
7852820,7853820," Oh no."
7853820,7854820," Okay."
7854820,7855820," Let's try to fix that."
7855820,7859820," Uh, so let's introduce the camera, camera, camera."
7859820,7864820," So, and we can be sure that the camera is going to be zero initialized because this is"
7864820,7865820," how we initialize things."
7865820,7868820," Uh, camera is not defined."
7868820,7869820," Ooh."
7869820,7871820," Okay."
7871820,7874820," So, um."
7874820,7883820," Can I define the camera then above this entire step, but below forward declaration of the game."
7883820,7884820," That would be kind of cool."
7884820,7885820," That would be kind of cool."
7885820,7886820," Not going to lie."
7886820,7887820," Okay."
7887820,7893820," So, yeah, it makes it kind of difficult to do this kind of shit."
7893820,7894820," So, you need to forward declare."
7894820,7894820," Oh my God."
7894820,7903820," Everything here has to be forward declared and shit."
7903820,7904820," Okay."
7904820,7905820," All right."
7905820,7906820," All right."
7906820,7913820," The main problems is that if you start interconnecting them too much, if you start interconnecting them"
7913820,7914820," too much, it just doesn't really work that easily."
7914820,7914820," All right."
7914820,7915820," Let's make a small break."
7915820,7916820," Let's make a small break."
7916820,7917820," I really want to pee."
7917820,7918820," Um, small break."
7918820,7919820," Um, yeah."
7919820,7920820," So it's going to be SB."
7920820,7921820," Three minutes."
7921820,7936820," Uh, and after three minutes, we're going to continue working on that."
7936820,7942820," So I think I'm starting to see the flow with like having the global, uh, game because it"
7942820,7944820," becomes like a forward declaration madness."
7944820,7950820," Uh, and also because of that, I'll have to put different components of the game on dynamic"
7950820,7954820," memory, which will complicate initialization of the game."
7954820,7957820," And I really don't want to complicate initialization of the game."
7957820,7960820," So after the break, we're going to try to figure out how to fix all that."
7960820,7961820," All right."
7961820,7963820," Let's make a small break."
7963820,7965820," And you guys have fun."
7965820,7966820," Bye."
7966820,7967820," Bye."
7967820,7968820," Bye."
7968820,7969820," Bye."
7995820,8025800," Thank you."
8025820,8055800," Thank you."
8055820,8085800," Thank you."
8085820,8102460," All right."
8102460,8103540," We're back."
8103540,8105420," How about that?"
8105420,8106480," How about that?"
8108100,8108880," All right."
8108880,8113980," So, one of the things we can probably have."
8113980,8120520," So, camera depends on the game and game contains the camera."
8120520,8122900," So, how do we resolve that?"
8124800,8126340," How do we resolve that?"
8126340,8136780," The one way to resolve that, the actually obvious way to resolve that, of course, is to, you know, do it like that."
8136780,8138880," You just define camera here."
8139560,8146020," Then you allocate camera on the stack and you also forward declare, like, everything here, right?"
8146020,8151080," So, you forward declare everything."
8151080,8152960," But I don't want to do that, right?"
8152960,8155280," Because that means I have to allocate the camera and everything."
8155280,8157960," I just want to be able to do something like that."
8158040,8168120," But that will not work because that means camera has to be known at this, the size of the camera has to be known at this time."
8170060,8175400," And I think it should be able to be known because the camera by itself doesn't need to know the size of the game."
8175400,8176600," Yes."
8176600,8182160," So, and this is where we have to start, like, splitting into headers and implement..."
8182160,8183900," Okay, so that explains everything."
8183900,8187100," All right."
8187100,8194600," So, we need to start splitting everything into, like, into files to make it easy to do that."
8194600,8204440," But if we're not going to actually split anything, what we need to do is just define camera like this, forward declare..."
8204440,8216000," Like, not forward declare, but just declare camera above the game, like this, just declare it above the game as the struct, and also define its methods."
8216000,8218580," All right."
8218580,8222680," So, but then you have to put that into separate files and whatnot."
8224120,8224540," All right."
8224540,8226260," So, here are the methods."
8226260,8227420," Yeah."
8227420,8235740," So, it was a pretty good idea to go on the break because, yeah, I finally realized what I'm doing here."
8235740,8238280," Welcome back."
8238280,8240020," Yeah."
8240020,8244900," So, the only reason why we're defining it here is so the game can know the size of the camera."
8244900,8250220," And then, inside of this camera, we don't even need to do that."
8250220,8251480," All right."
8251480,8252640," We don't even need to do that."
8252640,8254560," And we'll just have to prefix all of that."
8254560,8256280," And, yeah, so that makes sense."
8256280,8260700," That actually makes a lot of sense."
8260700,8262240," And this is going to be camera."
8262240,8264940," Classical C++."
8264940,8269400," With its headers and implementations and whatnot."
8269400,8270900," Right."
8270980,8271940," And that will compile."
8271940,8271940," And that will compile."
8271940,8274940," Well, sort of."
8274940,8278240," Oh, yeah."
8278240,8279760," And this one also has to be camera."
8279760,8283860," Another one."
8283860,8288940," No declaration, camera, something, something."
8288940,8289260," Really?"
8289260,8291400," You don't have such a declaration?"
8291400,8294680," Apparently, I maybe forgot about it."
8294680,8302140," So, this one has to be like this."
8302140,8305520," Well, sort of."
8305520,8307740," Because, I mean, the idea is correct."
8307740,8317240," It's just I have to go through the compilation errors and fix things like semicolons and typos and not declared signatures and stuff like that."
8317900,8320600," I mean, but the concept is working, right?"
8320600,8326600," So, it's just like we're dealing with statically typed compiled languages where if you make a mistake, it's just not compiled."
8326600,8329440," So, you have to sort of clean everything up."
8329440,8330840," And that's basically what it is."
8330840,8332600," Right."
8332820,8337560," So, of course, it's not like the flow in the idea."
8337560,8340440," There is no particular flow in the idea itself."
8340440,8343060," To be fair, yeah, I think."
8343060,8347540," All right."
8347540,8349340," So, now I just need to."
8349340,8353340," Okay."
8353340,8356240," Use of a deleted game."
8356240,8357320," Oh."
8357320,8361020," Why is the constructor deleted?"
8362820,8364940," Why is the constructor deleted?"
8364940,8377800," It's simply because the default definition would be ill-formed."
8377800,8382860," Why would it be ill-formed?"
8382860,8388240," Interesting."
8388240,8393480," The default definition would be ill-formed."
8393480,8408360," So, do I really have to specify the default constructor?"
8408360,8416360," I just want to allocate zero initialized everything on the stack."
8416860,8417500," And that's it."
8417500,8419560," I mean, I can try to do something like this."
8419560,8421020," I can do false."
8421020,8423780," I can then set this to null pointer."
8423780,8425540," And then this to null pointer."
8425540,8428000," And this to just zero initialized."
8428000,8429680," Like, just zero initialized everything, bro."
8429680,8433500," Could not convert."
8433500,8437060," Brace zero initialized."
8437060,8437360," Okay."
8437520,8438440," So, in the structure."
8438440,8438500," So, in the structure."
8438500,8440620," Right."
8440620,8441840," In the structure."
8441840,8443360," Just zero initialized everything."
8443360,8456380," Why do I do that?"
8456380,8457020," Excuse me?"
8457020,8459140," Like, why exactly I have to do that?"
8461560,8462580," Apparently I have to do that."
8462580,8464180," But I don't understand why I have to do that."
8464180,8465060," Like, seriously."
8465060,8467160," Why?"
8467160,8470300," It's so weird."
8470300,8472660," Like, okay."
8472660,8476600," Zero?"
8476600,8478260," You think it's gonna be..."
8478260,8480040," It's gonna work like this?"
8480040,8481180," I think it's..."
8481180,8484260," Like, doing game zero sounds like a C shit."
8484260,8489900," So, it's very C way of initializing it."
8489900,8492640," And I'm not sure if C++ will actually do that."
8492640,8493340," And it was..."
8493340,8495760," It's not something that it was complaining about."
8497340,8501200," So, I'm not sure if you're just actually suggesting something useful."
8501200,8504580," Or you're just guessing and making me waste my time."
8504580,8506880," Which is quite likely."
8506880,8508000," Okay."
8508000,8509820," So, let me actually take..."
8509820,8510780," Take a look."
8510780,8515880," And..."
8515880,8517760," Yeah."
8517760,8519740," You're just wasting my time."
8519740,8520240," Yes."
8520240,8521620," Okay."
8521620,8522420," I'm not gonna listen."
8522420,8523420," So."
8526140,8529040," It's really strange why we have to do it like that."
8529040,8534360," And it's probably because we're locating it in a dynamic memory."
8534360,8540360," So, the easiest way to do that..."
8540360,8543360," Let me try to take a look at the..."
8543360,8545360," Like, Google the problem and see..."
8545360,8547360," Try to understand..."
8547360,8549320," You know."
8549320,8551280," What exactly is going on."
8554940,8556320," Let me remove all of that."
8556320,8556960," It's not needed."
8556960,8561420," Okay."
8561420,8563000," It's implicitly deleted."
8563000,8563280," Okay."
8563280,8564700," So, it's a very interesting error."
8564700,8565660," Because, like..."
8565660,8566660," It's kind of strange."
8566660,8568500," So..."
8568500,8570220," Well, the problem is not with the node."
8570220,8571780," The node simply explains the reason."
8571780,8572060," Okay."
8572060,8572400," Whatever."
8572400,8574660," Instead of trying to default..."
8574660,8575160," You can..."
8577220,8584600," You can simply write your own default constructor for the class."
8584600,8587340," It's very strange."
8587340,8591120," Why just doing that is simply not enough?"
8591120,8594500," Why do I have to provide each individual field there?"
8599840,8601580," This is so weird."
8601580,8604700," Well, I mean, I can."
8604700,8607320," But that kind of defeats the point."
8607320,8609640," That kind of defeats the point of saying..."
8609640,8610120," Just..."
8610120,8610480," Bruh."
8610480,8611980," Just zero initialize everything."
8611980,8614820," That literally defeats the whole point."
8614820,8616060," And I don't like that."
8617520,8623200," Why are you doing that to me?"
8623200,8623700," Like..."
8623700,8624840," Why is it..."
8624840,8625340," Really?"
8625340,8630120," And then..."
8630120,8631960," Can I do it like that then?"
8631960,8636200," And..."
8636200,8637260," Oh my god."
8637260,8644840," I'm disappointed."
8644840,8646340," I'm so disappointed."
8647060,8647460," Fucking..."
8647460,8649060," This defeats the whole point."
8649060,8651400," I don't want to know the structure."
8651400,8653300," The internal structure of this entire shit."
8653300,8654660," I just don't care."
8654660,8660600," Just fucking allocate the object and zero initialize everything."
8660600,8661660," This is so dumb."
8661660,8662580," Oh my god."
8662580,8670980," I think the issue is the V2s in the class V2s."
8670980,8671940," Wait."
8671940,8674720," Is that because I have a constructor for V2?"
8676100,8677280," Oh shit."
8677280,8679980," That could be the reason, actually."
8679980,8684160," Oh shit."
8684160,8684620," Okay."
8684620,8685680," That explains it."
8685680,8686940," Yeah."
8686940,8687460," There we go."
8687460,8692500," So basically..."
8692500,8693740," Oh my god."
8693740,8694360," It's so slow."
8694360,8695860," Yeah."
8695860,8697940," Since you have a constructor there..."
8697940,8698220," Yeah."
8698220,8698720," You..."
8698720,8699760," You have to..."
8699760,8702080," It's something that Jiang actually noticed..."
8702080,8703420," Not just a long time ago."
8703420,8704620," Right."
8704620,8706420," Cannot deduce template."
8706420,8706840," Yeah."
8706840,8707420," And that..."
8707420,8708420," That one is not gonna work."
8708420,8710040," I wonder if I can just do it like that."
8710040,8712300," Or..."
8712300,8712940," Let's see."
8712940,8715260," So I'll have to go through some of the problems in here."
8717860,8718440," All right."
8718440,8720160," So this one could be like this."
8720160,8726460," Okay."
8726460,8728420," And can I do it like that?"
8728420,8731260," Oh boy."
8731260,8731600," Oh boy."
8731600,8731920," Oh boy."
8731920,8732220," Oh boy."
8732220,8733160," I don't want to do that."
8733160,8735500," But apparently I'll have to do that for each of them."
8739000,8745280," And it also slows down dramatically because I'm using C mod in Emacs."
8745280,8750880," And can I just do it like that?"
8750880,8751760," Will it work?"
8751760,8754880," It's kind of promising."
8754880,8756060," It's kind of promising."
8756060,8757060," So..."
8757060,8757700," And I like that."
8757700,8759000," I like that it's very promising."
8759000,8761440," Okay."
8761440,8762660," That works."
8762660,8766940," So the problem was the constructor in V2."
8767360,8768720," Because the constructor..."
8768720,8770140," Since I created the constructor..."
8770140,8772000," It polluted the rest of the structure."
8772000,8773920," So you cannot just zero initialize it anymore."
8773920,8777020," I think Jiang was actually talking about it the other day."
8777020,8777740," Yeah."
8777740,8782700," So he said that the problem with C slash C++ is that if you like..."
8782700,8784820," Have at least like..."
8784820,8787620," I don't remember what exactly he said."
8787620,8789600," I think that's the result."
8789600,8793200," So you have one constructor in one of the classes and..."
8793200,8793400," Boom."
8793400,8795820," You have to define constructors everywhere."
8797160,8801760," I guess that's the flaw of this approach."
8801760,8806060," And that kind of makes it difficult to use other C++ libraries."
8806060,8809140," But not other C libraries."
8809140,8811360," It actually integrates with C libraries quite well."
8811360,8820200," So essentially, if you are programming with C slash C++ and you rely a lot on zero initialization rule..."
8820200,8824020," On zero rule, you're kind of stuck with using only C dependencies."
8824020,8827040," Runtime information."
8827040,8830300," I don't think it has anything to do with runtime type information."
8830300,8832800," We're just talking about constructors."
8832800,8835080," And default constructors."
8836980,8837560," All right."
8837560,8837960," So..."
8837960,8843780," Oh, yes, I know."
8843780,8845080," I'm an idiot."
8845080,8846440," I can have..."
8846440,8848700," I think I can have a default constructor."
8848700,8851500," So I can have something like this."
8851500,8853260," So, yeah."
8854700,8856120," I think I understand now."
8856120,8860580," So if I have..."
8860580,8864260," If I put it like this, it's not going to compile because it's ill-formed, right?"
8864260,8865280," Ill-formed."
8865280,8866360," But then..."
8866360,8869160," Can I just define like a default constructor?"
8869160,8870060," Is this how we do that?"
8871340,8872160," Just like this."
8872160,8873120," Yeah."
8873120,8875140," I completely forgot that I could probably do it like that."
8875140,8877100," Why didn't I think about it?"
8877100,8877400," Yes."
8877400,8878400," I just..."
8878400,8882720," I can just define a default constructor that zero initializes all of that and just..."
8882720,8882880," Yeah."
8882880,8884260," Okay."
8884260,8885400," So..."
8885400,8887120," And I can still have..."
8887120,8889500," But I already actually get rid of all of that."
8889500,8893980," So..."
8893980,8894340," Whatever."
8894340,8895000," Sure."
8895000,8896560," That was an interesting journey."
8896560,8897660," But yeah."
8897660,8900000," We recalled a little bit of a C++."
8901340,8902680," Okay."
8902680,8903540," What exactly I was doing?"
8903540,8905380," So..."
8905380,8906480," It's going to render."
8906480,8908520," Where is the game render?"
8908520,8912160," Yeah."
8912160,8922740," So maybe I should start splitting like a game, camera, and other stuff into separate files."
8922740,8925000," And then composing all of this."
8925000,8925640," Maybe not."
8925640,8927140," Maybe I'm going to do that a little bit later."
8927140,8930120," Alright."
8931340,8935940," So when I'm rendering everything, right?"
8935940,8938960," When I'm rendering everything, I want to take the camera, right?"
8938960,8941180," I want to take the camera and..."
8941180,8943040," How was it called?"
8943040,8944720," Camera..."
8944720,8946840," Something like view."
8946840,8947720," ViewRect."
8947720,8947980," Yes."
8947980,8949040," It was called ViewRect."
8949040,8950840," ViewRect."
8950840,8952380," And it gives me a ViewRect."
8955420,8956040," Let me go..."
8956040,8957080," Let me go..."
8957080,8957440," Where is..."
8957440,8958760," Where is the SimpC mode?"
8958760,8961660," Uh-huh."
8961660,8965260," SimpC..."
8965260,8966260," SimpC..."
8966260,8967760," Uh..."
8967760,8969660," The Val Buffer."
8969660,8971800," There we go."
8973160,8973700," Uh..."
8973700,8973920," Okay."
8973920,8975100," So here's the ViewRect."
8975100,8977540," And I can have it like this."
8977540,8978740," So here's the ViewRect."
8980700,8981320," Now..."
8981320,8988100," By looking at the position of the rectangle, I should be able to defer..."
8988100,8989320," Um..."
8989320,8996580," I should be able to defer the coordinate, the tile coordinate, if you know what I mean."
8996580,8997480," The tile coordinate."
8998480,9005620," So essentially, to defer the tile coordinate, I need to take the position and divide it by"
9005620,9006720," tile coordinate, right?"
9006720,9009340," By dividing it by tile coordinate, I can..."
9009340,9010740," Um..."
9010740,9011040," Yeah."
9011040,9013920," But that's not really enough."
9013920,9017700," Because now I need to floor it, right?"
9017700,9019920," I need to be able to floor this entire thing."
9019920,9026420," And the question is, how can I floor each individual component of the vector in a convenient way?"
9026920,9027880," So, uh..."
9027880,9032340," It would be kind of cool to do something like floor, like map floor, right?"
9032340,9032820," Uh..."
9032820,9035300," Map floor and then cast to integer."
9035300,9036980," You see what I mean?"
9036980,9039020," So, um..."
9039020,9044780," Essentially, divide by tile size, floor the entire thing, and cast it to integer."
9044780,9046840," I want to be able to do things like that."
9046840,9048400," Uh..."
9048400,9049760," Let's implement a function."
9049760,9053160," Let's implement a functionality that will enable us doing that."
9053160,9055260," So, because I think it's useful."
9055260,9057700," So, struct, vector, so we have cast."
9057700,9059140," And, uh..."
9059140,9059680," Oh, shit."
9059680,9061980," I don't have a template highlighting."
9061980,9064020," Okay, so we'll have to do something like this then."
9064020,9066200," All right."
9066200,9068520," So, it's going to be template type name."
9069280,9070660," But if we are mapping..."
9070660,9073200," Well, I mean, it probably doesn't matter."
9073200,9076680," So, v2 is going to be like this."
9076680,9077820," Map."
9077820,9080760," And we're going to accept a function that returns u."
9080760,9082460," Right."
9082460,9083780," And this function is going to be pointer."
9084720,9086880," And it takes t."
9086880,9090220," So, and then, what we're going to return..."
9090220,9092400," We're going to essentially return..."
9092400,9093220," Uh..."
9093220,9094640," Yeah, it has to be like this."
9094640,9097540," But, I mean, something like this probably is easier."
9097540,9100040," F of x, f of y."
9100040,9100980," There we go."
9101060,9105820," So, now you should be able to easily map your vectors."
9105820,9106260," Right."
9106260,9109220," And that will enable you to easily, like, fluff in them."
9109220,9111480," If you know what I mean."
9111480,9112300," All right."
9112300,9114760," So, we take the rectangle."
9114760,9117400," We might as well actually maybe..."
9117400,9119100," Nah, it's not very particular as well."
9119840,9121920," So, this is the coordinate."
9121920,9125220," Yeah, it's basically making it a functor."
9125220,9126940," It's basically making it a functor."
9126940,9132260," So, I want to be able to have a function that..."
9132260,9135140," Essentially, takes the absolute coordinates."
9135140,9136740," The position."
9136740,9139760," And returns you the tile coordinates."
9139760,9141360," Right."
9141360,9143660," And essentially, what it does..."
9143660,9145840," It just divides by tile size."
9145840,9148880," Flourfs entire thing."
9149840,9152740," And casts it to..."
9152740,9154920," Casts it to integer."
9154920,9156520," There we go."
9156520,9158220," So, and..."
9158220,9158520," Yeah."
9158520,9159720," How can we call it?"
9159720,9166240," How would it be better to call it?"
9166240,9171220," So, this kind of coordinates is obviously like tile coordinates."
9171220,9174440," Way to dank?"
9174440,9175640," What is exactly way to dank?"
9175640,9176200," I don't understand."
9176200,9178160," Whatever."
9178620,9180000," So, and..."
9180000,9181480," Here is the thing."
9181480,9185660," So, one corner is going to be F rect pose."
9185660,9186380," Right."
9186380,9188820," F rect pose."
9188820,9192200," And another corner is going to be a rect pose plus a rect size."
9192200,9193600," There we go."
9193600,9195120," That expression."
9195120,9196460," I think it's pretty readable."
9196460,9197700," Yeah."
9197700,9200540," You divide by tile size, then map it and cast it."
9200540,9202500," So, I think it's pretty readable."
9203980,9204440," Okay."
9204440,9204480," Okay."
9204480,9208600," So, this entire thing could be also cost."
9208600,9212920," Nice."
9212920,9217360," So, and..."
9217360,9224940," So, you have these coordinate things that you now have to iterate over."
9224940,9237520," And essentially, the way you're going to do that is int x a x b x, right?"
9238200,9246360," And the same thing but replace x with y."
9246360,9249860," And there we go."
9249860,9256180," So, now you're essentially iterating over all of the coordinates, like tile coordinates."
9256720,9261420," So, they're visible within, visible within the camera."
9261420,9262760," That's what it is."
9262760,9264900," So, they're visible within the camera."
9264900,9268000," Okay."
9272000,9275640," But, again, I want to come up with a good name for this function."
9275640,9280680," And to come up with the name of this function, we need to introduce, like, special types."
9280680,9287240," So, we can have something like tile coordinates, right?"
9287240,9289840," And essentially, it's going to be v2 int."
9289840,9291460," So, this is the tile coordinates."
9291460,9294060," Tile coordinates."
9294060,9297500," Tile coordinates."
9297500,9302500," And this one is abs coordinates, but it's kind of..."
9302500,9307780," Could be, like, a world coordinates, maybe."
9307780,9309060," I don't know how to call them."
9309060,9310480," Like, maybe abs."
9310480,9315500," So, and we can just do something like abs to tile."
9315500,9319720," And then we can do an opposite thing, like tile to abs."
9319720,9325260," Tile to abs."
9325260,9329400," And after that, we can do abs to tile."
9329400,9331460," And not to file, but to tile."
9331460,9335940," And, yeah."
9335940,9343160," And all of that probably should be defined outside of the game, of course, because it has nothing to do with the game."
9343160,9347780," Well, it does have something to do with the game per se, but it doesn't have anything to do with this chart thing."
9351680,9361800," So, and once you're iterating over these things, we should be able to render those tile retengals."
9361800,9367240," We should be able to render these tile retengals."
9367240,9368880," And the question is, how are we going to render them?"
9368880,9372260," Abs should be float."
9372260,9372880," Isn't it float?"
9372880,9374100," Yeah, it should be float."
9374100,9374500," Thank you."
9374500,9377540," Oh my god."
9377540,9379320," Emacs is getting slower."
9379320,9382440," Yes, emacs is getting really slow."
9382440,9384960," When it's working with C++ files."
9384960,9388240," And especially, that involves a lot of, like, template stuff."
9388240,9390320," It's just getting really, really sluggish."
9394280,9395580," It's just so painful."
9395580,9403940," And I cannot switch to anything else, because in Visual Studio Code, I cannot navigate as fast as in Emacs."
9403940,9414560," Fortunately, the only solution for me would be to do something like text mode, and just don't have any highlighting, but people will leave the stream saying,"
9414800,9416260," Oh, where is highlighting?"
9416260,9422760," It's open."
9422760,9423760," So, I already fixed it."
9423760,9427440," I actually implemented something called SimpCMod."
9427440,9429520," So, yeah."
9429520,9431120," That's how I fixed it."
9431120,9438260," So, the problem with SimpCMod is that it doesn't support C++ keywords for some reason."
9438260,9439200," I'm not sure why."
9439200,9441760," C++ keywords."
9441760,9444200," Let's actually add C++ keywords."
9444800,9451820," Are these all of the C++ keywords?"
9451820,9457120," I wish it was just a list that I can copy-paste, but obviously, they don't make it easy for me."
9457120,9461220," Obviously, they don't make it easy for me."
9461220,9465220," So, maybe..."
9465220,9468580," We have to do it like that."
9468580,9470860," Does it contain the latest ones as well?"
9470860,9472860," So, what's the version?"
9474800,9478880," Yeah, to be fair, right now, what I need..."
9478880,9480680," I can just add them manually."
9480680,9482220," I think I can just add them manually."
9482220,9483360," So, it's going to be SimpCMod."
9484000,9490800," So, the things I don't have, I don't have using, so it's going to be using."
9490800,9494840," What else?"
9494840,9495840," Template."
9495840,9499480," Template and site name."
9499480,9503900," Operator, probably, as well."
9503900,9505980," Probably operator."
9507060,9510340," And I don't know why I'm adding, like, these things here."
9510340,9510960," It's a lisp."
9510960,9512340," You don't have to do it like that."
9512340,9513520," Right."
9513520,9517660," So, eval, buffer, and SimpCMod one more time."
9517660,9518120," And there we go."
9518120,9519180," So, here we have them."
9519180,9521520," Type name didn't work?"
9521520,9521980," Really?"
9521980,9524800," Are you sure?"
9524800,9526660," Uh-huh."
9527660,9528180," I see."
9528180,9530140," Okay, very funny."
9530140,9532060," So, yeah."
9532060,9533860," It's not going to work that easily."
9533860,9539860," It's not going to work that easily."
9539860,9543380," So, that means I have to match keywords differently."
9543380,9544320," I see."
9544320,9546460," So, how do I match keywords?"
9546460,9548040," How do I match keywords?"
9548780,9555000," So, I'm using the reject opt, which, yeah, doesn't really work that well."
9555000,9558940," It is what it is, and it isn't what it isn't."
9558940,9567540," I wish I could just use this mode, but it's not really working great with C++, but we may try."
9567540,9570280," Okay."
9570280,9571620," So, I have to go back."
9571620,9574880," Okay."
9574880,9577480," So, let's take a look at, oh, I don't have a division."
9577480,9578380," I just realized that."
9578520,9578640," Okay."
9578640,9583880," So, division should be similar to multiplication."
9583880,9589060," So, because, I mean, it's basically multiplication, isn't it?"
9589060,9590080," I think it is."
9590080,9597280," So, you're dividing this thing, and you just divide the scalar."
9597280,9598920," All right."
9598920,9600060," So, do we have anything else?"
9600060,9603380," And I forgot a semicolon, so that's understandable."
9603380,9607440," That's understandable."
9607440,9607780," Okay."
9607780,9609140," So, everything seems to be compiling."
9609140,9612700," Now, how are we going to render all of that?"
9615360,9617280," So, here is the coordinate."
9617280,9618760," So, here is the coordinate."
9618760,9624000," And I want to be able to map this to an absolute value, right?"
9624040,9629360," So, it's going to be tile to an absolute value, so it's going to be tile to absolute, tile to..."
9629360,9631940," I cannot autocomplete this stuff."
9631940,9633060," Oh, yeah."
9633060,9634420," Because I never actually implemented it."
9634420,9637560," So, now I want to be able to do tile to absolute."
9637560,9644920," So, you take tile coordinates, position, and absolute coordinates."
9646200,9647860," And how do you convert them?"
9647860,9648800," How do you convert them?"
9648800,9650040," Well, you take the position."
9650040,9654820," You probably want to cast it to float first."
9657660,9660880," Can you add simpc to your .files?"
9660880,9663260," No, because it's a separate repo."
9663260,9674640," It's not finished, by the way."
9674840,9676540," I do not recommend using it in production."
9676540,9678100," Okay."
9678100,9678940," So, here's the float."
9678940,9684760," And essentially, after that, I want to simply multiply it by a tile size."
9684760,9687960," I'm just switching it."
9687960,9690060," Okay."
9690060,9690400," How?"
9690400,9691580," What is this?"
9691580,9692840," First of all."
9692840,9695060," Okay."
9695060,9697020," So, then tile to abs."
9697020,9701600," And I really don't like abs, because it makes it sound like an absolute value, like a function."
9704840,9708580," Maybe you could call them three coordinates."
9708580,9710180," How about that?"
9710180,9713080," Like, there's a tile coordinates, and there are three coordinates."
9713080,9715820," You see what I mean?"
9715820,9717540," Like a grid and non-grid."
9717540,9718900," Global."
9718900,9724320," It sounds like an opposite of local."
9724320,9726780," Tile coordinates are not local."
9726780,9727820," They're also global."
9727820,9729360," If you know what I mean."
9729360,9733580," They're just in a different sort of plane."
9734840,9740380," I don't think it's a good name."
9740380,9741560," Aligned."
9741560,9744260," Aligned with what?"
9744260,9745200," What aligned?"
9745200,9749180," How calling these things aligned makes sense?"
9749180,9749760," I don't understand."
9749760,9755940," A row."
9755940,9756820," No, no, no."
9756820,9762020," World is also a bad name, because it's an opposite of screen coordinates."
9762020,9763180," Right."
9764840,9768760," No, because the tile coordinates, they're also located in the world."
9768760,9771620," Both of them are in the world."
9771620,9773600," Both of them are global."
9773600,9775860," They're just different."
9775860,9777500," You see what I mean?"
9777500,9780040," Both of them are in the world, and both of them are global."
9780040,9781740," Row is a good name."
9781740,9782160," Okay."
9782160,9785500," It's a little bit better."
9785500,9787060," It's a little bit better."
9787060,9794160," But logically, then, tile should be called cooked cartonist."
9794160,9796040," Okay."
9796040,9797920," Row."
9797920,9803500," Yeah, maybe it's good."
9803500,9805460," So, a row."
9807460,9808220," All right."
9808220,9810980," So, row to tile, tile to row."
9810980,9812660," Not bad."
9812660,9816060," Not bad."
9816060,9819280," So, first coordinates are actually..."
9819280,9821100," Like, tile coordinates are discrete."
9821100,9823560," And row coordinates are continuous."
9826380,9827420," Hello, fro-rick."
9827420,9829520," Oh, I know you."
9829520,9832600," You're, like, a cachet's friend."
9832600,9834220," Hello."
9834220,9840640," Yeah, so, essentially..."
9840640,9841360," I'm really sorry."
9841360,9844260," This is an English-speaking stream, so the majority of people don't understand you."
9845220,9851280," Yeah, so, essentially, what I'm doing, I'm re-implementing the math libraries, essentially."
9851280,9853760," The only dependency I use is SDL, too."
9853760,9860900," So, I'm really sorry that I speak in English, because this is an English-speaking stream,"
9860900,9864080," and the majority of viewers, they don't speak Russian."
9864080,9869860," Fortunately or unfortunately, it just depends on how you view it."
9871460,9875660," Though, Russian is a pretty good language in some places."
9875660,9880240," So, if you consider learning a foreign language, I would recommend learning Russian."
9880240,9884760," All right."
9884760,9890700," Though, it's kind of a difficult language if your native language is English."
9890700,9896520," If your native language is other Slavic languages, learning Russian could be easier."
9896520,9897780," But, yeah."
9899180,9902340," Because you already kind of know the gist of the Slavic languages."
9902340,9904100," Hello, John."
9904100,9905420," Hello."
9905420,9906300," Welcome to the channel."
9906300,9910220," So, we have row coordinates, row tile."
9910220,9910740," All right."
9910740,9918120," Oh, by the way, I probably should trust you."
9918120,9921300," Here we go."
9925300,9936840," You can say only Russian, then streamer speaks only Russian."
9936840,9938100," Yes."
9938100,9941660," My Russian is actually kind of bad."
9941920,9948640," I cannot pronounce certain phonemes of Russian language, which makes me sound really weird."
9948640,9950760," So, yeah."
9950760,9952760," I prefer speaking English instead."
9952760,9955480," I mean, I'm not a fake Russian."
9955480,9958040," It's just like I can't speak Russian properly."
9960360,9961620," Where's Sonic from?"
9961620,9964080," I'm from America."
9964080,9966240," Fuck yeah."
9966240,9967360," Sorry."
9967360,9969580," America."
9969580,9971700," Fuck yeah."
9973520,9986920," I can't pronounce it by itself."
9986920,9988600," It's actually..."
9988600,9991040," I know the mechanics of this sound."
9991680,9993120," The thing is..."
9993120,10000280," My mouth just makes it difficult to pronounce that sound casually."
10000280,10001120," Right?"
10001120,10007100," So, I really have to put a lot of effort into just pronouncing this specific sound."
10007100,10009780," And I cannot use it fluently in the speech."
10009780,10010900," So, that's the problem."
10010900,10012120," So, it's not like you're going to..."
10012120,10012800," I got you."
10012800,10013460," You cannot pronounce it."
10013460,10014380," I can't pronounce it."
10014480,10019900," I can actually make a lot of different sounds with my mouth because I used to do beatboxing."
10019900,10022540," So, I do know how to do interesting sounds."
10022540,10023760," It's not like..."
10023760,10025080," It's just, you know..."
10025080,10028820," It's difficult for me to use that sound in speech."
10028820,10031920," If you know what I mean."
10031920,10034280," Yeah."
10034280,10036100," Beat."
10036100,10038060," Nah."
10038060,10040440," I haven't practiced quite some time."
10040440,10042920," So..."
10042920,10045460," Sorry."
10045460,10046520," Couldn't help myself."
10046520,10051620," So, what I was doing?"
10051620,10052280," I don't remember."
10052280,10054340," Yeah."
10054340,10056220," We were trying to actually render the tiles."
10056220,10064060," Render the tiles."
10064060,10065780," It's going to be too..."
10065780,10069300," Okay."
10069300,10069980," Tile to row."
10069980,10070580," Right."
10070700,10078780," So, when you convert tile coordinates to row coordinates, row gachi coordinates, you get"
10078780,10081480," the top left corner, right?"
10081480,10082760," So..."
10082760,10085160," And we can denote it as a position, right?"
10085160,10086940," So, this is a position."
10086940,10087500," A position."
10087500,10093560," After that, I can create some sort of a size."
10093560,10097440," And size is just a vector of tile, size, tile, size."
10097440,10099260," Cool."
10099260,10104400," And once we've got that, we can probably construct a rectangle."
10104400,10105200," Struct."
10105200,10107300," Rect."
10107300,10107760," Yeah."
10107760,10109060," So, I can do rect."
10109060,10109660," Pose."
10109660,10110280," Size."
10111280,10118700," And then, I want to be able to just render such rectangle without worrying about anything."
10118700,10123200," Cooking stream with beatboxing elements."
10135200,10143580," So, what I want to have is essentially a function fill rect."
10143580,10146560," That I can put a rect into it."
10146560,10154000," And also, you know, provide some sort of a function, like red."
10154000,10156120," And it will just do that."
10156120,10158620," And also, fill rect should probably accept the renderer."
10159520,10159960," Right."
10159960,10161300," You should also accept the renderer."
10161300,10161820," And there you go."
10161820,10170280," So, maybe because of that, I can kind of inline position and the size."
10170280,10171860," I think that would be kind of cool."
10171860,10175080," Position and size."
10175080,10179900," Would that be nice?"
10179900,10184360," So, it will give me like a big expression."
10184360,10186060," Is it?"
10186060,10187400," Nah, I think it's not worth it."
10187400,10188740," I don't think it makes it more readable."
10189420,10189920," So, yeah."
10189920,10195200," Doing compiler job."
10195200,10196280," Yeah."
10196280,10201580," Feel rect."
10201580,10201960," Okay."
10201960,10204220," So, this thing will accept as the renderer."
10204220,10206300," Here's the renderer."
10206300,10208560," And then, it also will accept a rectangle."
10208560,10215040," And the thing is, I think we should be able to accept any type of the rectangle."
10219320,10222780," But in case of the floats, we want to be slightly different."
10222780,10223320," Okay."
10223320,10225260," So, I'm going to accept specifically floats."
10225260,10229580," I'm going to accept specifically floats."
10229580,10231560," And also, I'm going to accept a caller."
10231560,10232880," Do I have a hex caller?"
10232880,10233200," Yes."
10233200,10234520," I'm going to accept a hex caller."
10234520,10236580," Like this."
10236580,10237280," Cool."
10238380,10239540," So, here's a hex caller."
10239540,10241540," And how we do that?"
10241540,10244720," So, we need to be able to convert all of that into sdl rect."
10244720,10248640," So, we're going to call it sdl rect."
10249340,10252060," And then, we take rect position x."
10252060,10262340," And what we need to do here is to essentially cast a rectangle."
10262340,10264200," No."
10264200,10268260," We have to do floor from that rectangle."
10268260,10269500," We do floor from that rectangle."
10269500,10271020," And then, we have to cast it to integer."
10271300,10272740," And here's an interesting thing."
10272740,10282160," Why can't we do something like correct map floor and then cast to integer?"
10282160,10283420," Why can't we do that?"
10283420,10287200," So, let's also implement all these functions for the rectangle as well."
10288060,10288380," Right."
10288380,10296920," And once we do that, we should be able to, you know, just have something like this."
10296920,10300260," Where I can convert r x, r..."
10300260,10306980," Actually, r position x, r position y, r size x, r size y."
10306980,10307500," Right."
10307500,10309900," And then, I will be able to fill everything."
10309900,10310200," Yeah."
10310200,10313680," So, let's actually implement maps for this thing as well."
10313680,10315020," Let's go to sdl rect."
10316620,10319540," C++, yesu, yesu, kawai desu."
10319540,10320460," Hello, Anabosho."
10320460,10321660," What's up?"
10321660,10322180," What's up?"
10322180,10325760," Yeah, we're doing pretty epic C++ today, believe it or not."
10325760,10327620," So, we have a type rectangle."
10327620,10331420," And we're going to implement a map function for the rectangle."
10331420,10337360," We're going to treat rectangle as a functor in the sense of, like, category theory, like in Haskell."
10337360,10345660," So, the map will accept a function, a function pointer that takes t"
10345660,10347220," and returns u."
10347220,10350540," And u is a different type to which you can convert things."
10350540,10353120," Right."
10353120,10356000," So, and..."
10356000,10357440," And, and, and, and."
10357440,10359580," This thing will return a rect..."
10359580,10361540," Rect u."
10361540,10364060," So, this is how we do that."
10364180,10365820," So, rectangle is just two vectors."
10365820,10368860," It's just two vectors, position, and size."
10368860,10373580," And what we're going to return here, we're going to take the position and also map it with F."
10373580,10376480," And we're going to take the size and also map it with F."
10376480,10377340," There we go."
10377340,10384260," This kind of stuff is needed when you have a rectangle that contains float and you want to map it with floorf."
10384260,10384720," Right."
10384780,10390320," So, it will apply floorf function on each component and consequently on each vector in here."
10390320,10392500," So, we also want to..."
10392500,10398900," To be fair, cast2 is just a special case of the map."
10399340,10405500," But, unfortunately, static cast is not really a function."
10405500,10407180," Or is it a function?"
10407180,10410640," Who knows what is static cast?"
10414520,10418100," Can I take a pointer to static cast?"
10418100,10420420," Is that a thing you can do?"
10420420,10422900," Or is it just an expression?"
10422900,10428720," This is a very interesting question."
10428720,10429940," Actually."
10429940,10439460," Well, if it is a function, it's probably a very much overloaded function."
10439460,10440940," It should be a template."
10440940,10445640," Because, yeah, a static cast could be like this."
10445640,10446560," It could be a template."
10446560,10448520," Type name T."
10448520,10449940," Type name U."
10449940,10457060," And, essentially, static cast TX."
10457060,10457980," Something like that."
10457980,10460580," And, it's probably not going to fly."
10460580,10461900," It's probably not going to fly."
10461900,10464280," So, we'll have to do the cast ourselves."
10464280,10468940," So, template type name U."
10470300,10477520," And, what we do here, we just return the following thing."
10477520,10481800," Pose, cast, to, U."
10481800,10486420," And, size, cast, to, U."
10486420,10487380," There we go."
10487380,10493860," So, now we are able to not only map the values of the rectangle, but also cast them."
10494800,10495240," Hopefully."
10495240,10498340," So, rect, rect, rect."
10498340,10500440," So, here's the fill rect."
10500440,10503180," So, we take the rectangle with the floats."
10503180,10504640," We fluff everything."
10504640,10506100," And, we cast everything to integer."
10506100,10508800," And, then, we easily convert all of that to sdl rect."
10508800,10513860," So, maybe it would be better to have a function that converts that to sdl rect."
10517860,10518860," That would be kind of cool."
10518860,10526300," So, something like this."
10526300,10529860," Let's do rect, F."
10529860,10532000," And, it accepts rect, int."
10532000,10533980," Rect."
10533980,10535380," And, it just returns you."
10537080,10539300," It essentially returns you that."
10539300,10540220," Right."
10540220,10542740," Yeah."
10542740,10545380," And, then, you can take these things."
10545380,10547620," And, just do rect."
10547620,10551680," So, after that, you can simply do F."
10551680,10554700," For this entire shite."
10554700,10556780," Though."
10559280,10560080," Nah, it's alright."
10560080,10570280," So, we can call it rect for sdl."
10570280,10571680," Yeah."
10571680,10572520," Rect for sdl."
10572520,10576360," Rect for sdl."
10576360,10581260," It gets our rect and returns the rectangle for the sdl."
10581260,10587340," Once we've got that, we should be able to use sdl fill rect functions."
10587520,10599180," And, what it does, it just, it even accepts the, wait, really?"
10599180,10605340," Wait."
10605340,10607700," What is the, really?"
10607700,10611140," Oh, I didn't know that."
10611140,10612000," This is so cool."
10612000,10613060," Wait a fucking second."
10613060,10613480," Seriously?"
10613480,10615680," You can just do that?"
10617480,10618940," Oh, it uses surface."
10618940,10619720," Disgusting."
10619720,10621540," We need a renderer."
10621540,10622700," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
10622700,10623400," sdl."
10623400,10627440," Render fill rect."
10627440,10630680," Yeah, we need a render fill rect."
10630680,10635440," And, this one, yeah, it doesn't work the way I want to work."
10635440,10640400," So, we also have to wrap it in sec."
10642160,10647960," So, we have to provide the renderer and here is my renderer and then I can take the pointer to sdl rect."
10647960,10648780," There we go."
10653620,10654240," Oh, my God."
10654240,10654360," Oh, my God."
10654360,10654360," Oh, my God."
10654360,10657600," Emacs is very, very sluggish right now."
10657600,10666080," By the way, does Visual Studio Code has Emacs bindings extension?"
10666080,10673540," Do we have any professional Visual Studio Code users in the chat?"
10673540,10674380," Does it have?"
10674380,10674840," Probably."
10675220,10675620," Okay."
10675620,10677680," Let's check it out."
10677680,10683220," So, optvscode."
10683220,10686120," Code null."
10686120,10688340," Sandbox."
10689940,10691200," And, I'm going to open what?"
10691200,10692040," I'm going to open it."
10692040,10692400," It's interesting."
10692400,10700820," All right."
10700820,10705980," So, I'm pretty sure it's not going to be as convenient as Emacs."
10705980,10708840," But, it's just unbearable."
10708840,10712580," Whatever is going on."
10712580,10714380," Wait."
10714380,10716380," Did I open everything correctly?"
10716380,10718720," Am I in the right place even?"
10718720,10722320," Yeah, I'm not in the right place."
10722320,10723140," That's for sure."
10723140,10725440," So, let's actually close everything."
10725440,10728020," Apparently, I'm in the completely wrong place."
10728020,10732140," And, what was the name of the function?"
10732140,10733660," It was three."
10733660,10734880," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
10734880,10738080," You already found it."
10738080,10739660," Okay."
10739660,10740080," Thank you."
10740080,10744280," But, I mean, I'm going to install it from Visual Studio Code itself."
10744280,10745120," So, I don't think."
10745120,10748080," That's pretty cool that it has that."
10748720,10750860," Extensions."
10750860,10752760," So, let's go here."
10752760,10754200," And, let's do Emacs."
10754200,10757760," Emacs emulation."
10757760,10760240," Emacs emulation for..."
10760240,10761460," So, it has four stars."
10761460,10763140," And, let's install this shit."
10765660,10766620," It's just search."
10766620,10767800," There's more than one extension."
10767800,10768700," Yeah, I can see that."
10768700,10771040," Yeah, I see that."
10771040,10773840," Oh, did it install it?"
10773840,10774080," Okay."
10774080,10775260," So, I think it installed it."
10775260,10776960," Alright."
10776960,10779220," So, how do I go..."
10779220,10779360," Okay."
10779360,10780880," This is how I'm going to go back."
10781860,10782420," Okay."
10782420,10785620," It's as slaggish as Emacs though."
10785620,10787060," Oh my god."
10787060,10789200," It emulates Emacs so well."
10789200,10791220," It is as slow as Emacs."
10791220,10792100," That's beautiful."
10792100,10792540," Okay."
10792540,10796220," So, I want to be able to just do const."
10796220,10799960," And, okay."
10799960,10802100," If I want to..."
10802100,10802440," Okay."
10802440,10804980," It even supports splitting the screen."
10804980,10807160," And, it supports it so bad."
10807160,10809100," Oh my god."
10809100,10809680," Really?"
10809680,10811520," Holy shit."
10811520,10813040," Holy..."
10813040,10813800," Oh my god."
10813800,10814500," Okay."
10814500,10816120," Okay, buddy."
10816120,10816620," Okay."
10816620,10817560," No."
10817560,10819220," X2 is actually..."
10819220,10820160," Really?"
10820160,10820260," Really?"
10826200,10827660," X2 is a horizontal one."
10827660,10831020," But, X2 does a completely different..."
10831020,10835400," Does the user who implemented this extension even use Emacs?"
10835400,10836520," They don't even use Emacs."
10836520,10837480," Yes, they don't."
10837480,10843040," It's horrible."
10843040,10845520," And, yeah."
10845520,10849700," To be fair, in terms of slaggishness, it's like just like Emacs."
10849700,10853860," So, I don't know if I want to switch to it."
10856180,10862540," Thank you so much for seven months of tier one subscription."
10862540,10863640," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
10863640,10866220," And, welcome to our epic Emacs club."
10866220,10868260," All right."
10868260,10868780," So, whatever."
10868780,10870200," I'm going to stop doing this."
10870200,10875480," Some time ago, I tried to use Vim emulation, but the input latency makes it..."
10875480,10876280," Yeah, exactly."
10876280,10880840," So, the beauty of Emacs and Vim is that because..."
10880840,10884400," Well, I mean, not so much about Emacs, but in Vim..."
10884400,10890560," Because the latency is so low, you can be so goddamn fucking productive."
10890560,10893800," Like, holy shit, you're not productive, but efficient."
10893800,10894180," Efficient."
10894180,10895680," That's the wrong word."
10896840,10904100," Yeah, and if you have a, like, a huge latency, it kind of, like, defeats the whole purpose of this keybunding, so you don't need it."
10905300,10910300," I'm going to do four things at once, so why are we using this Visual Studio Code suddenly?"
10910300,10912180," Because Emacs sucks."
10912180,10916960," Okay."
10916960,10920160," Emacs sucks."
10921600,10922080," All right."
10922080,10923960," So, can I do make in here?"
10923960,10924640," I think I can."
10924640,10925140," Beautiful."
10925140,10927480," And I can automatically jump to this entire shit."
10927480,10927920," Beautiful."
10927920,10932340," So, yeah, that's pretty cool."
10932340,10935580," So, if I do make..."
10935580,10938000," So, expected primarix..."
10938000,10938800," Oh, shit."
10938800,10940540," Yeah."
10940540,10943580," So, essentially, I'll have to do..."
10943580,10944360," Let's see."
10944360,10945320," Ah!"
10945320,10950060," Fucking classic."
10950060,10950800," Am I right?"
10951600,10954080," Warning, unused."
10954080,10954560," Okay."
10954560,10956080," So, it's just a warning."
10956080,10959320," And, yeah, we have an unused hex color."
10959320,10962320," But now, we also need to set..."
10962320,10964960," How is it called?"
10964960,10970080," SDL set render draw color or something."
10970080,10971980," Time for GMAX."
10971980,10972700," Maybe."
10972700,10974240," What's up, old man?"
10974240,10976560," Ascender render draw color, I think."
10976560,10978660," Or is it set render fill color?"
10980660,10981660," Mm-hmm."
10981660,10983660," Set render..."
10983660,10990140," Set render fill color."
10990140,10992620," What's up, what's up?"
10993760,10996680," Why are you suggesting me draw color?"
10996680,10997880," Or is it..."
10997880,10999780," Oh, it's probably the draw color, then."
10999780,11000400," Sure."
11000400,11003320," So, let's go."
11003320,11007680," So, I'm going to remove that."
11007680,11008860," So, it's going to be sec."
11008860,11010500," Mm-hmm."
11010500,11013720," It's going to be like this."
11014500,11018700," But now, I want to actually find this entire thing and remove it."
11018700,11021680," Hex."
11021680,11025920," I think it was unpack hex color."
11025920,11027820," And we're going to just use this color in here."
11027820,11031500," And also, we need to..."
11032200,11035720," So, yeah."
11035720,11037400," I know how to use Vim."
11037400,11038060," Look at that."
11038060,11039380," I'm a professional Vim-er."
11039380,11042020," Professional goddamn Vim-er."
11042020,11043220," All right."
11043220,11045360," So, we have semicolon here."
11045360,11047040," And I forgot to just do that."
11047040,11050480," Mm-hmm."
11051340,11051960," And, yeah."
11051960,11053500," So, we don't have red in here."
11053500,11055700," So, we need to probably define that color."
11055700,11056500," So, background."
11056500,11059220," Background color."
11059220,11060000," So, here's a color."
11060000,11063000," Let's define hex color red."
11063000,11064720," And it's going to be just something like this."
11064720,11066780," FF zero, zero, zero, zero."
11066780,11067440," FF."
11067440,11068300," There we go."
11068300,11070220," Try this extension."
11070220,11072060," At least for me, there's no latency."
11072060,11073580," I'm sorry."
11073580,11074200," I don't know both."
11074200,11075240," I'm already over it."
11075240,11080540," So, I'm already in the middle of implementing the thing for my game."
11080540,11082160," And I don't want to lose my context."
11082160,11082780," I'm really sorry."
11082780,11085000," I just switch my context very, very quick."
11085000,11086740," So, it's too late."
11086740,11088320," Okay."
11088320,11089360," So, here it is."
11089360,11092080," And what's funny is that it's too huge."
11092080,11093500," Why is it so huge?"
11093500,11094760," I have no idea."
11094760,11098720," Oh."
11098720,11101880," I kind of do understand what the fuck is going on."
11109540,11138280," So, the thing didn't work the way I wanted to work for some reason."
11138280,11141680," So, fill rect."
11141680,11143060," So, here's the fill rect."
11143060,11144600," And this is where I use fill rect."
11144600,11146060," And it should just work, actually."
11146060,11146920," But it didn't."
11152800,11158520," And I wonder why."
11158520,11162520," Because we probably never..."
11162520,11167380," Do we actually update the camera?"
11167380,11168820," I'm so confused."
11168820,11169960," Like, what is going on?"
11169960,11171980," I'm so confused what's going on."
11171980,11172840," So, camera."
11172840,11174520," Update DT."
11174520,11176720," Maybe that's what we need to do here as well."
11178520,11180600," Maybe that's what we need to distract camera."
11180600,11181420," Right."
11181420,11186980," And maybe camera update."
11186980,11189780," So, yeah."
11189780,11190540," That's really weird."
11195500,11196120," And..."
11196120,11202600," Wait."
11202600,11204660," Oh, I see what's going on."
11204660,11207200," Okay."
11207200,11207840," That's pretty cool."
11207840,11213960," Feel..."
11213960,11216480," Wrecked."
11219280,11221160," But we don't even use camera for that, do we?"
11221160,11223960," Oh, I see."
11223960,11227020," Oh, I see."
11227020,11228700," Okay."
11228700,11231080," So, that's very interesting."
11231080,11233880," So, we need to be able to also map..."
11233880,11237900," Different kinds of structures..."
11237900,11239940," To the camera."
11239940,11243980," So, to screen, rather."
11243980,11244500," Right."
11244500,11245100," To screen."
11245100,11248900," To screen, to screen."
11248900,11250500," So, here is to screen."
11250500,11251620," And..."
11251620,11255020," So, let's define this thing like that."
11255020,11256980," So, this one is going to be just a rect."
11256980,11260320," So, this is a rect."
11262980,11265980," So, we're mapping this entire stuff as well."
11265980,11268880," To screen."
11268880,11269680," Hmm."
11269680,11281360," Okay."
11281360,11285320," So, essentially, we need to reconstruct the rectangle."
11285320,11287800," So, it's..."
11287800,11288820," And it's not..."
11288820,11291100," It's not a point."
11291100,11292200," It's actually a rectangle."
11292200,11295760," So, it's going to be a position."
11295760,11298100," And we have to do to screen."
11298100,11300840," To screen."
11300840,11306000," Rectangle screen."
11306000,11307660," Rectangle size."
11307660,11312140," So, now we should be able to..."
11312140,11315140," Take the rectangle and..."
11315140,11317180," Map it to the screen coordinates."
11317180,11317900," Hopefully."
11318580,11321040," I'm not 100% sure if it will work as I expected."
11321040,11321620," But, yeah."
11321620,11323440," So, essentially."
11323440,11327400," Okay."
11327400,11330580," So, now, when I'm trying to render the game."
11330580,11331000," Right."
11331000,11334280," Feel erect."
11334280,11335240," Feel erect."
11335240,11337600," So, I take this rectangle."
11337600,11339280," And I also want to be able to take the camera."
11339740,11341480," And do a to screen on it."
11341480,11347300," And after that, the whole thing should be red."
11347300,11347940," Hopefully."
11347940,11351320," So, if it's not red, that means I made a mistake somewhere."
11351320,11353520," But now, since I'm mapping everything appropriately."
11353520,11354460," Yes."
11354460,11355200," Perfect."
11355200,11356520," That's exactly what I want."
11356740,11358740," Also, I need to set a logical size."
11358740,11361060," SDL logical size."
11361060,11362820," SDL logical size."
11362820,11364140," Renderer set logical size."
11364140,11365020," That's exactly what I want."
11365020,11370440," So, and it should be set to the size of the screen."
11370440,11372520," Okay."
11372520,11373540," So, when do we set it?"
11373540,11375060," I guess after initial..."
11375060,11376980," Well, we have to provide the renderer."
11376980,11378760," So, that means we have to do it somewhere here."
11380760,11381120," Right."
11381120,11382100," So, we're going to put it here."
11382100,11385520," And, of course, it's going to be like that."
11385520,11394100," So, width and height."
11394100,11395180," How is it going to be?"
11395180,11401220," So, let me quickly replace a screen width."
11401220,11403640," That was difficult."
11403640,11405040," I don't know why."
11405040,11406700," It's kind of strange."
11406700,11408980," Screen width."
11408980,11410040," Yes."
11410320,11411960," And then I can take height."
11411960,11413280," Let it go."
11413280,11414060," Cool."
11414060,11417020," So, then I take the renderer from the game."
11417020,11420120," And also, I need to wrap everything in sec."
11420120,11424240," So, it will check all of that stuff."
11424240,11425800," It will check all of that stuff."
11425800,11429000," All right."
11429000,11433240," Cool."
11433240,11434500," Everything seems to be compiling."
11434500,11437880," So, let me try to go."
11437880,11438200," Okay."
11438740,11447300," So, now, I want to pick a random color based on the coordinates of the rectangle."
11447300,11447840," Right."
11447840,11454600," So, we should be able to see some sort of colors going on."
11454600,11456640," That's basically what I want to do."
11460700,11463060," So, we have X and Y."
11463060,11467420," And we need to map it to one of the colors, more or less, essentially."
11467420,11472080," So, maybe we can have like a set of the predefined colors."
11474960,11478640," What, where can we get the set of such predefined colors?"
11478640,11486400," So, palette."
11486400,11493600," I want to have like a some sort of a quick palette."
11495600,11496340," Zim generator."
11496340,11496920," Zim generator."
11496920,11504160," Something that I just can't grab without putting too much effort into it and without clicking anything."
11504160,11504980," Like, predefined."
11504980,11506960," Why do I have to wait?"
11506960,11509840," It's that one."
11509840,11512220," I don't want to spend time on coming up with something."
11512220,11517900," I want to just have something that is already, you know, like I can just copy paste the whole thing."
11518900,11519520," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
11519520,11520220," Something like this."
11520220,11521500," Can I have more colors?"
11521500,11538180," So, let's use this one."
11538180,11546680," So, can I have like a new?"
11547540,11550040," How to open an empty file."
11550040,11553940," Okay, so, I don't know how to open an empty file in Vim."
11553940,11555460," I'm spending too much time on it."
11555460,11560520," Alright, so, we didn't copy paste the last thing, like two."
11560520,11563900," Alright, so, then I'm going to add FF."
11563900,11566900," Then I'm going to add 0x."
11566900,11572000," So, let's put the comma in here."
11575080,11578400," Alright, so, let me see."
11578400,11580080," So, now we can have this kind of colors."
11581640,11587660," And let's just put everything here."
11587660,11593600," So, pretty cool."
11593600,11595720," So, we have colors."
11595720,11599040," And maybe I can just pick the random colors from there."
11599040,11600700," And how can I pick the random colors?"
11600760,11603560," Well, I can just overflow them."
11603560,11607100," Not overflow them, but wrap around them."
11607100,11608800," We're using modular arithmetics and whatnot."
11608800,11612440," Yeah, that's probably the easiest way to go about that."
11612440,11614320," So, let's spin const."
11614320,11615720," Maybe even constexpr."
11615720,11616640," I mean, why not?"
11616640,11618720," Colors."
11618720,11619500," Size."
11619880,11621440," Maybe it doesn't matter really."
11621440,11623560," Color size."
11623560,11626000," And it's going to be size of colors."
11626000,11629300," Divided by size of colors."
11629300,11629860," Zero."
11629860,11630540," There we go."
11630540,11632380," So, and now."
11632380,11634520," Fill rect."
11634520,11635760," Fill rect."
11635760,11637080," So, I'm filling the rect."
11637080,11640620," And I just need to pick a random color from this thing."
11640620,11641960," So, how are we going to do that?"
11642640,11649320," So, essentially, I'm using colors and x plus y."
11649320,11656540," And I need to do a modular over colors size."
11656540,11659480," And that should give me something, hopefully."
11659480,11664200," Yeah, there we go."
11664200,11665880," Cool."
11672640,11673320," Interesting."
11673320,11676840," It's doing the thing."
11676840,11685540," What's funny is that logical size is completely fucked up."
11685540,11688400," And I think I know why."
11688400,11691600," Yeah, I think I know why."
11691600,11695760," Because the window size should be the screen size."
11695760,11698380," So, because it now stays the same."
11698380,11699360," Right."
11699360,11701240," So, it's going to be window rect."
11702380,11705280," Well, rect view, I think."
11705280,11706440," So, it's a rect view."
11706440,11708240," How is it called?"
11708240,11710140," I need to go to the struct camera."
11710140,11712280," Struct camera."
11712280,11713160," View rect."
11713160,11713980," It's called view rect."
11713980,11714340," Sure."
11714340,11717080," Let me find it."
11717080,11718740," So, and essentially."
11718740,11721760," Yeah, we're using window size."
11721760,11725160," So, let me go to the window size and reimplement it."
11725160,11726520," So, here it is."
11726520,11730840," So, and in window size, we're going to essentially always return screen width."
11730840,11731320," Right."
11731320,11732480," We always return screen width."
11732480,11734480," And then always return screen height."
11734480,11735540," All right."
11735540,11740640," And then, if I try to rebuild everything, that should work."
11740640,11742320," Yes."
11742320,11744140," Yeah, essentially, it doesn't matter."
11744140,11745700," Strawberry hacker."
11745700,11746700," Oh, my God."
11746700,11749360," Thank you so much for tier one subscription."
11749660,11750600," Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you."
11750600,11752060," Your first subscription, by the way."
11752060,11755140," And welcome to our epic game development club."
11755140,11756180," How about that?"
11756180,11759440," Welcome, welcome, welcome."
11759440,11761920," Enjoy your epic zoysian emotes."
11763200,11764780," So, and it will go indefinitely."
11764780,11767840," So, it goes through the, like, infant lane or whatnot."
11767840,11772180," Which is kind of interesting."
11772180,11775680," Maybe we can make it move a little bit faster."
11776520,11783140," Right, because somewhere here, I said the camera velocity, maybe somewhere in the lane, right."
11783140,11786000," So, where is the camera?"
11786000,11789680," So, camera velocity."
11790060,11792340," I can probably replace 10 with 100."
11792340,11795360," Right, and just see what's going on."
11795360,11798060," So, it should go a little bit faster."
11798060,11799580," Yeah, now it goes a little bit faster."
11799580,11804740," So, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
11804740,11807660," So, we now have some sort of a grid, as you can see."
11807660,11809220," We have some sort of a grid."
11809220,11814160," And we can now define player on that grid."
11814160,11816640," And that's pretty cool."
11817440,11825580," So, I wonder if Vim has some sort of, like, a rainbow mode."
11825580,11827000," So, I can inspect that mode."
11827000,11832460," Or do I have to install some satellite dependencies?"
11832460,11834280," Vim rainbow mode."
11834280,11838880," Vim awesome rainbow."
11838880,11842280," I need a cup of pride mode."
11846720,11851300," So, too much effort."
11851300,11852780," Too much effort."
11852780,11854060," Show me."
11854060,11856360," Rainbow parentheses."
11856360,11857800," Who cares about parentheses?"
11857800,11858660," It's not useful."
11858660,11862160," Okay, so we have this kind of stuff."
11862160,11866840," So, maybe I probably have to define these things manually."
11866840,11868620," I probably have to define them manually."
11873100,11877740," Can I have a permalink on this thing?"
11878440,11879140," Probably not."
11879140,11879160," Probably not."
11879160,11880960," All right."
11880960,11882100," So, it is what it is."
11882100,11887480," All right."
11887480,11888500," I want to make a cup of tea."
11888500,11890820," I want to make a cup of tea before I continue."
11890820,11892860," Does anyone have any questions?"
11892860,11893280," Maybe."
11893280,11895080," Why are we making a cup of tea?"
11901080,11903100," Is today Emacs absence days?"
11903100,11903620," No."
11903620,11905200," I am still using Emacs."
11905200,11905960," What are you talking about?"
11905960,11906780," This is Emacs."
11906780,11910420," Does anyone have any other questions?"
11910420,11915760," Why are there so many SMS leaks lately?"
11915760,11916980," I don't know what you're talking about."
11918760,11919920," What are we doing right now?"
11919920,11923400," We're testing an interesting idea that I explained at the beginning of the stream."
11923400,11925780," And I don't really want to repeat the explanation."
11925780,11926920," I'm researching."
11926920,11929600," I'm trying to..."
11929600,11930260," Well, essentially."
11930260,11930540," Okay."
11930540,11932140," I'm going to briefly explain it."
11932140,11938860," I'm trying to develop a game using a slightly different approach than usual and see if it works or not."
11938980,11943040," And the game is just something quickly I can develop or something."
11943040,11950500," Get different color sets and randomize the sets of colors to use at each game."
11950500,11950840," Why?"
11950840,11957360," Does anyone have any other questions?"
11957360,11967520," At the beginning, wondering what happened."
11967520,11968140," Yeah."
11968980,11977220," If you want to implement it quickly, why not RayLib?"
11977220,11982080," Because RayLib imposes a very particular approach on you."
11982080,11987000," And I'm checking exactly their approach."
11987000,11989020," So, I don't know."
11989020,11992240," It's like..."
11992240,11997700," I want to learn what is the best approach for developing frameworks."
11998040,12002060," And it's like, why didn't you use React for that if you want to put the type of quick..."
12002060,12003940," Well, I mean, I can make in React."
12003940,12006180," That's why."

12227540,12229740," Alright, so I'm back."
12229740,12230740," Let's continue."
12230740,12233740," So, what I want to do now..."
12233740,12237740," I want to introduce the position of the player, right?"
12237740,12239740," CinderTube Warren, welcome."
12239740,12240740," How are you doing?"
12240740,12241740," Game."
12241740,12243740," So, here's the game."
12243740,12245740," Struct game."
12245740,12249740," So, vector 2 and..."
12249740,12252740," Yeah, we have this thing as a tile coordinates."
12252740,12254740," So, player position."
12254740,12256740," So, here's player position."
12256740,12260740," But maybe it makes sense to, like, introduce an actual player."
12260740,12262740," Yeah, I think it makes sense."
12262740,12266740," So, it's going to be struct player."
12266740,12273740," And it's going to be tile coordinates."
12273740,12276740," An actual position of the player."
12276740,12280740," And then we should be able to update and render and so on and so forth."
12280740,12282740," Right, so, Matias is ready."
12282740,12286740," I'm going to quickly pour a cup of water and come back."
12296740,12298740," I'm going to quickly pour a cup of water."
12298740,12299740," I'm going to quickly pour a cup of water."
12299740,12300740," I'm going to quickly pour a cup of water."
12300740,12301740," I'm going to quickly pour a cup of water."
12301740,12302740," I'm going to quickly pour a cup of water."
12302740,12303740," I'm going to quickly pour a cup of water."
12303740,12304740," I'm going to quickly pour a cup of water."
12304740,12306740," I'm going to quickly pour a cup of water."
12306740,12307740," I'm going to quickly pour a cup of water."
12307740,12308740," I'm going to quickly pour a cup of water."
12308740,12310740," I'm going to quickly pour a cup of water."
12310740,12311740," I'm going to pour a cup of water."
12311740,12312740," I'm going to quickly pour a cup of water."
12312740,12313740," I'm going to pour a cup of water."
12313740,12315740," I'm going to pour a cup of water."
12315740,12333740," I'm going to pour a cup of water."
12333740,12336740," So, the player should have a render."
12336740,12339740," And just that."
12339740,12342740," It doesn't need to accept anything, in my opinion."
12342740,12345740," On top of that, does it need any updating?"
12345740,12348740," Maybe it does need any updating, but not for now."
12348740,12350740," Essentially, how are we going to do that?"
12350740,12361740," I want to have a function something like erect of tile."
12361740,12364740," So, for this."
12364740,12366740," Yeah, this is perfect."
12366740,12368740," So, we have fill erect."
12368740,12372740," And where do we have these conversions?"
12372740,12374740," Yeah, this is perfect actually."
12374740,12376740," So, it's going to be erect."
12376740,12378740," Maybe float."
12378740,12380740," Or maybe just int."
12380740,12381740," Yeah."
12381740,12382740," Or maybe float."
12382740,12383740," Okay."
12383740,12385740," Rect of tile."
12385740,12389740," Essentially, it accepts the tile coordinates, right?"
12389740,12394740," And returns you a rectangle in the row coordinates that represent that."
12394740,12398740," So, and we've already done that, but we never extracted that to a separate function."
12398740,12401740," So, essentially, we did that somewhere here."
12401740,12406740," So, rect of tile."
12406740,12408740," So, let's actually put everything here."
12408740,12409740," So, this is position."
12409740,12410740," This is a size."
12410740,12414740," And we just return like a position and size in here."
12414740,12415740," So, there we go."
12415740,12417740," So, this is the rect of tile."
12417740,12421740," So, and then where we fill the rect, we fill it here."
12421740,12425740," And I should be able to do the following thing."
12425740,12429740," Rect of tile."
12429740,12430740," Tile."
12430740,12433740," And the tile is x and y."
12433740,12434740," And the tile is x and y."
12434740,12436740," And we don't have to do that thing here."
12436740,12437740," Right."
12437740,12438740," So, then we fill rect."
12438740,12440740," And then we do that."
12440740,12442740," Then we do that."
12442740,12445740," And we just pick one particular color in here."
12445740,12446740," So, yeah."
12446740,12448740," We have a rect of tile."
12448740,12450740," And then we can essentially render all of that."
12450740,12453740," So, this thing will probably never be needed."
12453740,12457740," But that's totally fine."
12457740,12458740," Okay."
12458740,12460740," So, here's the rectangle."
12460740,12461740," Here's the player."
12461740,12464740," And what we do, we take rect of tile."
12464740,12467740," Rect of tile, which is the position."
12467740,12469740," So, we have a rectangle."
12469740,12475740," And then we're trying to fill rect by taking the renderer from the game."
12475740,12476740," Right."
12476740,12477740," Renderer from the game."
12477740,12481740," And using the color of what?"
12481740,12483740," What's actually called player color."
12483740,12484740," Right."
12484740,12485740," It's going to be player color."
12485740,12486740," There we go."
12486740,12488740," So, rect of tile."
12488740,12491740," And on top of that, we'll have to actually apply that to the camera."
12491740,12494740," So, it's the camera to screen."
12494740,12495740," Right."
12495740,12496740," You have to map it to the screen."
12496740,12497740," And yeah."
12497740,12499740," So, the approach I'm trying to test."
12499740,12501740," The approach I'm trying to test."
12501740,12505740," I'm trying to test this approach where a game is a global variable always."
12505740,12509740," And like, you can access it at any point anywhere."
12509740,12513740," And I want to see if it actually scales."
12513740,12515740," If this kind of approach kind of scales."
12515740,12516740," And I kind of like it."
12516740,12519740," Because this is exactly what I want to do when I'm developing games."
12519740,12521740," I just want to have a global game."
12521740,12523740," Because everything is so interconnected with each other."
12523740,12525740," It's just insane."
12525740,12526740," Yeah."
12526740,12529740," It's absolutely insane how everything is interconnected in me."
12529740,12539740," Alright."
12541740,12542740," What's up."
12542740,12542740," What's up."
12542740,12543740," Promogador."
12543740,12544740," Programador."
12544740,12545740," Binabiu."
12545740,12546740," How's it going?"
12546740,12547740," How's it going?"
12547740,12548740," Hmm."
12548740,12549740," So, let's make a cup of tea."
12549740,12550740," Hmm."
12550740,12574100," Let's make a cup of tea. Just trying to stay focused. It's really difficult to stay focused"
12574100,12584500," after streaming for almost four hours. So, here's the player and we can render the player."
12584500,12598980," That's cool. So, I want to have some sort of like a checker board. So, we have these two"
12598980,12610100," colors. Right. And let me extract them to something like a background color. Right. It's going to be"
12610100,12622580," const hex color background color one. And this one is going to be background color two. So, and we're"
12622580,12628340," going to use them for like a checker pattern and whatnot. And it's needed because we need some sort"
12628340,12640580," of like a point of reference. And we'll soon we'll see why. So, where's another place where we do"
12640580,12650900," that? Okay, cool. Now, the actual color. The actual color is going to be what? Hex color."
12656340,12665220," X plus y. X plus y divided by two. But that could be also negative. Right. So, this entire thing could"
12665220,12673620," be also negative. So, when I'm thinking, should I also take an absolute value of them? I think I should."
12673620,12677140," So, if I take the absolute values of this entire things"
12679620,12689060," and then do a mod two. And if it's equal to zero, I have to use background color one. Otherwise, I have"
12689060,12696660," to use background color two. There we go. And then I can use this entire stuff without all of this. So,"
12696660,12702420," it's going to be cooler. So, let's see if it's going to work or not. So, it's probably going to fail. Yeah,"
12702420,12707620," of course it fails. So, I need to jump to the compilation error. Where is the compilation error? So,"
12707620,12717220," the problem... Oh yeah, I forgot to end with semicolons because it's C++. What else? What's"
12717220,12724180," what's exactly wrong in here? I don't understand. Tile to row, row to tile. I use position. Everything"
12724180,12733780," seems to be okay. I don't understand. So, could you tell me... I wish I use Emacs because in Emacs I could at least see other than it."
12744100,12752660," It's just f*cking worst. Like, I cannot find a good alternative to anything. Shadow of the parameter. Okay. So,"
12752660,12760820," that was shadow in the parameter. A rect of tile. Okay. So, this is a tile. So, this is what we're going to call it."
12763860,12770260," So, I have to deal with it with the laggy Emacs then. I just have to deal with it. Okay. So,"
12770260,12777540," that means I have to implement this entire thing after the game. All right. So, let's put it somewhere here."
12784740,12793780," So, let's put it here. How to implement it after. And is it going to work now? Of course."
12793780,12801460," Okay. Player color. So, and what's going to be the player color? That's a good question. It could be"
12801460,12807300," some something yellowish. I kind of like that yellowish color. So, let's quickly introduce"
12807300,12814580," that. So, it's going to be const x color. And I'm going to just grab this one. And let's go."
12814580,12825940," It did work. And I'm going to do j3.gss. Okay. So, as you can see, there is like this checker pattern."
12825940,12833540," So, it's really subtle. And that's the point. It's a really subtle checker pattern. And that's the point."
12834420,12844980," Cool. Now. Camera, camera, camera, camera. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. So, the player. When I'm"
12844980,12856500," rendering everything. So, it would be kind of cool to actually introduce the background as a separate"
12856500,12864180," entity here and extract everything to like to there. I think it would be kind of cool. So, let me quickly do"
12864180,12872260," that. It's going to be structure, background, background. And to be fair, background doesn't"
12872260,12878420," really have any state. The state of the background depends on the camera. So, maybe I'm going to just"
12878420,12884180," extract the drawing of the background to a separate function within the game itself. So, render,"
12884180,12892180," background. Nothing special. So, this is basically what it's going to be. And yeah, I can essentially"
12892180,12902020," extract this entire thing to render background. Right. Render, background. There we go. And there we go."
12902020,12910020," I never tried Emacs28. Okay. Player render. Cool."
12915860,12920020," The sluggishness of the sluggishness of Emacs right now is not due to rendering, by the way."
12920020,12928900," There's nothing like, you know, it's super fast. It's just like a C mode."
12928900,12937540," It has nothing to do with rendering at all. Okay. So, the camera. Where is the camera initially"
12937540,12943700," positioned? So, maybe I need to... I'm going to set the camera to zero."
12943700,12949780," Player render. So, we don't have a player though."
12950660,12957220," Let me define player somewhere here. This approach is not bad. Okay. So, here's the player."
12957220,12967700," Here is the player. It's kind of positioned in a strange way. And I know why."
12972100,12979940," Okay. So, we have rect of tile. And I also want to introduce something like float center of tile."
12979940,12983780," Center of tile. And it's going to accept the coordinates here."
12983780,12994660," Tile. So, essentially, we start by converting the tile to its row form. And then we take this thing and"
12994660,13001780," add half of the size. We add half of the size of it. And to add half of the size, we multiply it by five."
13001780,13009620," There we go. Like this. So, now we have a center over the tile. So, struct camera. So, for the camera,"
13009620,13017540," I want to be able to set a target. So, it's going to be set target. It's going to be to float target."
13020100,13024980," Let me find all of the places where we do camera. Right."
13024980,13034100," And we're going to set velocity accordingly. So, velocity is going to be equal to"
13034100,13042660," target minus position, essentially, all the time. All right. So, now I need to find the camera update."
13042660,13047380," We update the camera. But before we update the camera, we also set a target for the camera as"
13048660,13054900," actually center of a tile where the player is positioned. So, here's the position of the tile,"
13054900,13060820," but it's actually tile. Okay. Struct player. Let's rename this thing into the tile. Right."
13060820,13067540," So, we take player style. We take the center of the tile and we set it as the target of the camera."
13067540,13073700," That's what's going on here. You see? So, and let's try to run that. And of course,"
13073700,13079780," it's not going to work because this thing has to be tile. And soon, we're going to see something."
13079780,13085140," Yeah. It's slowly moved to the center of the player. Kind of. Sort of."
13085140,13090660," Now, we need to be able to control the player. So, basically, when I press up, down, left, right,"
13090660,13094820," I want the player to actually change its coordinates. And what's interesting,"
13094820,13101620," the camera is going to follow the player. Hopefully, we'll see how it goes. So, so far,"
13101620,13110500," the approach that I'm taking here is very scalable. I'm capable of piling shed on top of the existing"
13110500,13117540," pile. And it's kind of cool. So, you should be just not afraid to break all of the conventions that"
13117540,13124740," you set yourself over the years of software development. Okay. Control, control, control."
13124740,13131140," So, let's go to the handle event. So, this is where we're going to have SDL key down, right? Here is"
13131140,13136260," the SDL key down. And we're going to just look at different keys, right? We're going to look at different"
13136260,13150100," keys. Yeah, this is an experiment. Okay. So, we're going to switch on event"
13150100,13163540," key, key, sim, sim. And we're going to have interesting things in here. So, it's going to be"
13163540,13173460," case SDL key, w. And what that will do, it will take the player tile. So, we have to go up. That means"
13173460,13181860," you have to add the following vector. You have to add the following thing. So, up means no changes in x,"
13181860,13190260," no changes in x, and minus one in y, right? So, and after that, we can probably break all of that stuff."
13190260,13197140," And let's actually do this. So, s is going to be that, but it's going to be just one. So, what about"
13197140,13207380," a? Actually, d. d is going to mean plus one in x, but nothing in y, nothing in y."
13207380,13219300," And a, a is going to mean minus this. All right. So, that's pretty cool. Let's see what's going to happen."
13220260,13227780," It does not compile, because why? I think they have to be small. Yeah, they are capitalized, weirdly."
13228980,13236180," Uh, all right. So, so, oh, the player is not a pointer. The player is not a pointer."
13238820,13239380," Okay. Sure."
13239380,13250340," Okay. That's pretty interesting. So, you can, uh, basically step by tiles and the camera"
13250340,13254180," also follows you and does all this stuff. So, that's pretty cool."
13256820,13263140," Um, so we can probably add more interesting stuff, uh, stuff in there. So, um, oh yeah,"
13263140,13268580," let's have to be super careful, uh, because of the repeat and stuff, but yeah."
13271220,13277300," So, we can probably add an animation, uh, when the player, uh, goes to the right, instead of just"
13277300,13281860," teleporting to the next tile, it maybe it slides into the, into the tile."
13287860,13292740," If you don't mind me asking, uh, from which country are you? Can't you hear from my accent?"
13292740,13300660," I'm from America, from the land of freedom, you know? Hell yeah, brother. All right."
13302660,13307620," Uh, so, what else are we gonna add? I really like that. This is so cool."
13307620,13314660," I'm from England, let's."
13314660,13328900," My president is Michael Jordan, by the way. Uh, all right. So."
13332660,13341860," Uh, we need to maybe add some things, um, maybe some collectibles and whatnot."
13341860,13346100," Maybe some walls. Who knows? Maybe."
13346100,13352900," Totally in Irish accent. Yeah, I don't know how to do Irish accent, so."
13352900,13358020," So, to top of the monitor, I'm sorry. Uh."
13361940,13364660," So, maybe we can introduce walls. That would be kind of cool."
13364660,13369220," But how can we introduce the walls?"
13369220,13373060," The walls could be, like, uh."
13373060,13378020," Generated randomly, but not really."
13378020,13391060," Um, I'm a little bit tired, because I'm already streaming almost for four hours, uh, but, uh, the"
13391060,13395940," experiment was the following. The experiment was the following. So, we managed to go, like,"
13395940,13401540," four hundred lines of code. I was expecting to be, like, from five hundred to one thousand."
13401540,13409460," Something like that. Uh, so, I think we have a big enough file to, like, for me to see that this"
13409460,13415780," approach is not that bad. I'm just curious if it can scale even further. So, the approach was the following."
13415780,13426900," You can essentially just have a huge game object that is global and everyone can always access to that object, right?"
13426900,13433700," For example, you have a camera. A camera at any point can just, uh, go to the game and access its renderer and do something there."
13434500,13436260," Uh, so, yeah."
13436260,13439700," And I think that's kind of cool."
13439700,13450500," So, and it enables you with piling shad on top. And, um, for at least, like, solo developer, it's not, you know, that bad."
13452980,13459540," This for a solo developer is not that bad. So, it's kind of okay. And for a small demo in here,"
13459540,13466260," I think it's, it's working quite kind of great. So, yeah. This was not, like, a, you know, real object or"
13466260,13472020," project or anything. It was just a small experiment to see how easy it is to pile shed on top."
13472660,13478020," So, you know what? I'm gonna probably just upload that on the GitHub for anyone who's interested in this"
13478020,13483380," piece of code. It's, it's, it's a throwaway code essentially, right? It's not meant to be anything."
13483380,13491940," It's just, you know, just weird idea. So, gitignore, uh, and I'm gonna gitignore, uh, this executable,"
13491940,13503860," and then I'm gonna also add README. Uh, so, what we're gonna put there? Three GSS. Just a small experiment"
13503860,13514100," on game architecture, right? On game architecture. So, the license is going to be MIT, of course,"
13514100,13521220," uh, right under MIT. Um, and the quick start is going to be the following."
13522580,13532420," Quick start. Uh, console, uh, make, and then just run it. Three GSS."
13532420,13539620," So, yes. Um, gitignore."
13543540,13556100," So, uh, ready, set, go, and let's actually commit all that. So, it's, it's not going to be anything,"
13556100,13561060," seriously. Uh, it's, I'm just, the only reason I'm uploading it is for people who just want to"
13561060,13571540," check it out or maybe learn something."
13571540,13573540," Hmm."
13573540,13582020," Uh, so, if you're judging scale in mind, in mind, the problem I see with your structure now, that your"
13582020,13588980," entities will both contain domain logic as well as infrastructure code. This is not a problem by itself."
13589700,13592340," It's not a problem by itself."
13592340,13610180," It's just stating the fact. Fact, fact is not a problem by itself."
13610180,13621380," it's not a problem by itself, it's not a problem by itself."
13621380,13630820," So, add origin."
13630820,13648900," All right, so, for, it's, some people already started, who started already?"
13648900,13650980," Build kick. Okay, sure."
13653380,13656820," I'm not, I don't mind. I don't complain. It's just, it's kind of funny."
13656820,13662980," Uh, all right. So, you can check out this thing here. Uh, this is not how you check it out,"
13662980,13665620," by the way. Uh, I think I could copy paste it. Uh, yeah."
13665620,13672660," All right, there we go. So, uh, might as well actually provide, like, a screenshot. Uh, maybe"
13672660,13682100," that'll be kind of cool. So, let me try to run this entire thing. Uh, right. So, yeah, one more time."
13682100,13683300," I want to run it one more time."
13685300,13693060," Uh, so, it's going to be scrot minus s. Okay. And I need to probably move this entire stuff"
13693060,13697300," somewhere here. So, is that what I need? Yeah, this is what I need. So, this is going to be"
13697300,13706580," thumbnail. Uh, thumbnail. And we're going to add that thumbnail to here. Uh-huh."
13710580,13722980," Uh-huh. Add thumbnail to, uh, to read me."
13722980,13739780," All right. So, it should be, it should be now, maybe. Yeah. Um,"
13741060,13746020," It doesn't do anything. Maybe I'm going to actually play with this, uh, thing more. Uh,"
13746020,13751060," just to pile more shit on top of it. But so far, so good. So far, so good."
13751060,13766740," It's really fun. Uh, all right. Uh, okay. So, I've been streaming for four hours already,"
13766740,13771380," and unfortunately, I'm really tired, boys and girls. And it's time for me to go."
13771380,13777780," Um, thanks everyone who's watching right now. Really appreciate it. Have a good one. And I see you,"
13777780,13781700," I guess, when? I guess when I'm going to see you all? I'm going to see you all tomorrow. Tomorrow,"
13781700,13785300," according to the schedule, we're going to be doing a virtual machine. Yes, we're going to continue"
13785300,13792100," developing our virtual machine in C. It's going to be fun. Trust me. Uh, so, join tomorrow. Uh, also,"
13792100,13796900," check out our schedule for more information on different projects we're working. Uh, check out"
13796900,13803300," our, uh, our WOTS channel for, um, for recordings of the streams. This stream is going to be there,"
13803300,13808580," but a little bit later, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. And also, check out our Discord server for"
13808580,13814980," offline discussion with the community. And, uh, I don't know. Let's maybe rate somebody? We haven't"
13814980,13820740," rated people in a while. So, do you guys have any suggestions on who to rate today? Is anyone epic"
13820740,13824900," streaming right now on, uh, science and technology section of Twitch?"
13824900,13834980," Cachey is game jamming. Happy fish, zero, zero. Thank you so much for a Twitch Prime. Thank you,"
13834980,13840660," thank you. Game jamming. You mean he developing a game or is he playing a game? I'm not sure."
13840660,13850420," Uh, where's Cachey? Okay, so, if he's doing programming, I'm down to rate him. If he's just"
13850420,13857300," playing a game, I'm not interested in that. I'm sorry. Developing. Okay, cool. So, let's actually"
13857300,13866740," rate Cachey. Cachey underscore. I think that's, uh, that's his name. All right. Get ready for the"
13866740,13871380," rate. Get ready for the rate, boys and girls. And, uh, I see you all tomorrow. Love you."
13871380,13879300," Mwah!"
13879300,13879300," Mwah!"
