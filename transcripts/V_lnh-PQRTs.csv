0,12780," All right, looks like we're live. Hello everyone and welcome to another Azurzin session. How about"
12780,21580," that? How about that? I bet you didn't expect that shit to happen. So today let's do a little"
21580,28540," bit of an announcement first, right? So I'm going to bring up my Discord server and let's make the"
28540,39620," announcement. Red circle live on Twitch and the topic of today's stream is essentially I rise my"
39620,46980," TempleOS. That's right. So I'm going to show the current state of my TempleOS and after that we're"
46980,53960," going to do AOC and Holy See Day 7. Right, so I'm going to give the link to the channel, right, to the stream"
53960,59280," twitch.tv slash cording. And I'm going to ping everyone who's interested in being pinged. There"
59280,65160," we go. The stream has officially started. How about that? I bet you didn't expect that the stream is"
65160,73280," going to officially start today, right? But it in fact started nonetheless. Alrighty, already, already,"
73280,83120," already. So let's take a look at GitLab. So doing AOC 2021. So for the past like six days, I suppose we"
83120,89440," were struggling with a pretty horrible default theme of TempleOS. So let's take a look at it for the last"
89440,96680," time. I'm going to go to my AOC folder. Right, by the way, all of the source code, you can find in the"
96680,103780," description. So here is here it is. Here's the source code. And for anyone, for anyone who's watching on"
103780,112520," Twitch, I'm going to copy paste this thing. All right, so let me see. So this is the default look and feel of"
112520,120560," TempleOS. We're about to witness it. There we go. So this is how it looks by default, which is kind of"
120560,128020," difficult to use. And I've been struggling to use it for like six days already. Today's like a seventh day. And I"
128020,136280," always my head always hurts after using TempleOS like for an hour is just like holy fucking shit. It's unbearable. So"
136280,141520," what I did, I did a little bit of research. And I finally found a way to actually replace the default colors of"
141520,150420," TempleOS. Luckily, it was relatively simple. So let me finish the latest changes from a repo. So and the"
150420,156460," changes that I did to the to the theme are available in the in the same repo, right? So I committed the"
156460,163720," entire configuration of my TempleOS along with the advent of code solutions. So you get basically everything"
163720,170620," for free, for free, just like TempleOS. So and after that, I'm going to merge origin master, right? So I'm merging"
170620,178960," that. So as you can see, I added a theme dot hc. And I'm going to sync the entire stuff into the temple, right? So I'm"
178960,193700," syncing all of the configuration into the temple, right? And I'm going to run my temple one more time. And this is how it's going to look like from now on. So isn't that Pogue? I think it's pretty Pogue. So essentially,"
193720,203620," what I did, what I did, I took the colors of a Groovebox theme, right? Groovebox, because apparently, it's very popular, and it's all right, it looks all right."
203620,233020," So and I basically put them into the TempleOS. So I'm going to copy paste this link into into the chat for everyone to see. And also, I'm going to put the link to the Groovebox in the description. Groovebox theme, right? I suppose it's like, it's traditionally comes from Vim, right? So and if we take a look at some of the solutions, right? So here it is, right? So this is how the source code looks like with this theme."
233020,254500," is it more readable now, right? At least it's not very bright anymore. Right? And it's just like more or less pleasant to look at. So yeah, let me know in the comments below. So yeah, this is basically how it looks like. And essentially, how I did that is very interesting. So let's actually go to the home folder, right? In the home folder, there is like a theme dot hc."
254500,281500," So what you can do is you can define an array of the size scholars, num, it's a predefined constant, basically the size of the palette of TempleOS, right? And if you basically go here, go to the definition of this thing. So basically, there could be only 16 colors, because the God said so. And here are the indices of the numbers of the colors, right? So what you basically have to do, you have to replace the corresponding colors."
281500,296500," And that's basically what I did. And then you can use the function gr palette set, right? And it basically sets the current palette, right? So it just goes ahead, iterates through all the colors and just sets all of them. So this is basically how I did that."
296500,308500," And the only thing you need to do after that is include that file in your home sys, right? You just include it and it gets executed, you know, every time you load up TempleOS, right? It's pretty convenient."
308500,323500," It's pretty convenient. So now finally, TempleOS is a little bit more usable. Because my head starts to hurt like when I use it for like an hour, and it's still good, didn't get used to that for like after six days."
323500,339500," So yeah, it actually looks pretty lovely. I really like how it looks like. So anyways, let's let's go. Let's go ahead and try to solve the seventh day of Advent of Code in Holy Sea."
339500,360500," Anyway, I'm sorry. So Advent of Code. So seven, day seven, the treachery of whales. Did I pronounce that word correctly? I'm not sure how this word is actually pronounced officially by the English speakers, because I'm not the English speaker."
360500,379500," All right. Treachery. Treachery. Okay, so I don't know. A giant whale was, has decided your submarine is its next meal. And it's much faster than you are. There's nowhere to run. Suddenly a swarm of crabs."
379500,386500," ...zooms in to rescue."
386500,392500," When you see the program sac folds. Suddenly a swarm of crabs zooms in to rescue."
392500,407500," Anyway. Eaching its own tiny submarine. Who would have thought? It's too deep for them otherwise. Zoom in to rescue. They seem to be preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor."
407500,416500," In the ocean floor. Sensors indicate a massive underground cave system. Just beyond where they're aiming. Holy fucking shit."
416500,429500," In a single paragraph this shit goes so fucking intense. You have a swarm of crabs. Each in its own submarine. And they're preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor with a massive underground cave system."
429500,436500," And all of that in a single paragraph. Like it's just shit. Shit went down real fast. So."
436500,445500," The crab submarines all need to be aligned before they will have enough power to blast a large enough hole for your submarine to get through."
445500,452500," However, it doesn't look like they will be aligned before the whale catches you. Maybe you can help."
452500,458500," All need to be aligned before they will have enough power to blast a large enough hole for your submarine to get through."
458500,462500," Okay, so align. Whatever aligning means. I'm not really sure what aligning means in this sentence."
462500,467500," There's one major catch. Crab submarines can only move horizontally."
467500,468500," Okay."
468500,475500," You quickly make a list of the horizontal positions of each crab. Your puzzle input."
475500,485500," Crab submarines have limited fuel. So you need to find a way to make all of their horizontal position match while requiring them to spend as little fuel as possible."
485500,494500," For example, consider the following horizontal position. Okay. So yeah, I see. So you can basically assume that their vertical positions are different, right?"
494500,501500," Their vertical positions are different, but their horizontal positions are also different."
501500,509500," So yeah, all the positions are different. And basically you need to adjust the sliders to make them go into like the same line."
509500,513500," But where this line is going to be located, it doesn't matter, I suppose. Right."
513500,518500," This means there is a crab with the horizontal position 16, a crab with the horizontal position 1, and so on."
518500,523500," Each change of one step in a horizontal position of a single crab costs one fuel."
523500,537500," You could choose any horizontal position to align them all on, but the one that costs the least fuel is a horizontal position 2 for this specific configuration, right?"
537500,542500," So to 2, 1 to 2. Uh-huh. Okay."
542500,551500," Well, I mean, you can just basically, yeah, you can kind of like brute force it to some sense. Okay."
551500,557500," This costs a total of 37 fuel. This is the cheapest position possible outcome."
557500,564500," More expensive outcomes include aligning at position 1, 41 fuel position 3 or position 10."
564500,569500," Remind the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible."
569500,572500," How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?"
572500,577500," Okay. So let's take a look at the puzzle input. So what are the ranges of the crabs?"
577500,581500," Okay. So these are their possible ranges, right?"
581500,585500," And it looks like it doesn't go beyond 1000, right?"
585500,604500," So yeah, essentially we can do like a histogram and then go and like try each individual possible position in here and just brute force that should be fine."
604500,608500," Okay. Let's give it a try."
608500,613500," Uh, so we'll see what's the maximum. I didn't want to do that actually."
613500,617500," Uh, okay. So, uh, let me, let me start this stuff."
617500,623500," So I'm going to go in here and I need to create a new day, a new day."
623500,630500," Uh, and I'm going to say zero seven. Oh, by the way, I recently discovered that you can actually zoom in in TempleOS."
630500,635500," Did you guys know that? I think it's like control alt Z. Yeah, there we go."
635500,643500," You can actually zoom in, but it's not particularly useful because like nothing like fits in there and you have to constantly like scroll like this."
643500,646500," And when you scroll it blinks like that and it's really weird."
646500,651500," I didn't think it's particularly usable, but it's, it's cool that it supports that to some extent."
651500,654500," Uh, right. So yeah."
654500,656500," All right. So here is the new thing."
656500,665500," And, uh, let me actually maybe, uh, quit the TempleOS because I also need to get all of the samples and also the input data and so on and so forth."
665500,670500," So let's actually mount AOC 2021 and, uh, okay."
670500,676500," So home AOC zero seven, um, not a directory."
676500,678500," So it already happened."
678500,682500," I think that already happened before, right?"
682500,688500," So if I do AOC 2021, right, there is no sevens folder, right?"
688500,694500," If I run my, uh, my virtual machine yet again, if I run my virtual machine yet again,"
694500,699500," Uh, right. There is a sevens folder in here, right?"
699500,701500," So I'm going to close the virtual machine, uh, one more time."
701500,708500," And then I'm going to mount one more time, uh, and then go into mount home, uh, and AOC."
708500,710500," And here is the seventh one."
710500,711500," It's kind of weird."
711500,714500," Like it doesn't work for the first try or something."
714500,720500," Maybe not everything is like synced, um, you know, with the hard drives and stuff like that."
720500,726500," But every time I essentially run something or amount something, I always called sync,"
726500,731500," which supposedly like syncs all of the like cached, uh, writes and reads and stuff like that."
731500,732500," So I'm not really sure."
732500,737500," Um, so that's kind of, kind of weird."
737500,738500," Anyways."
738500,739500," So, uh, let's go."
739500,740500," So, uh, let's go."
740500,741500," So this is going to be something like this."
741500,745500," I'm going to go into AOC and then zero seven."
745500,752500," So I'm going to go into, uh, sample TXT, uh, and let's grab the sample input."
752500,754500," So here is the sample input."
754500,757500," I'm going to put it in here, then I'm going to save it."
757500,758500," And there we go."
758500,763500," So let's go into the input TXT and grab the official input."
763500,769500," So the input is rather large, but I think we'll be able to parse it anyway."
769500,771500," So let's go."
771500,773500," Uh, right."
773500,782500," So apparently my internet one went down for a second yet again."
782500,784500," So, um, I dunno what happened."
784500,786500," Uh, anyway, let's actually continue."
786500,788500," So hopefully I synced everything."
788500,789500," Right."
789500,794500," Hopefully I synced everything and I should be able to have, uh, all of the input data in here."
794500,795500," Right."
795500,798500," So, uh, let me see, here's the sample and here is the input."
798500,799500," All right."
799500,800500," So that's good."
800500,805500," Uh, and, um, let me, let me actually think."
805500,806500," Right."
806500,812500," So we're going to do, we're going to probably just start iterating, uh, while we have some data,"
812500,813500," right?"
813500,817500," While the string that holds the whole content of the file is greater than one."
817500,818500," Uh, right."
818500,822500," And the first thing we probably want to do is, uh, chop a single number."
822500,824500," So I need to define that number somewhere here."
824500,825500," Uh, right."
825500,827500," So I have to do SV chop I 64."
827500,830500," I'm going to provide the pointer to the string."
830500,833500," And then, uh, I'm going to assign it to, to the number."
833500,837500," And then we can just bring that number just to see if everything's okay."
837500,838500," Uh, right."
838500,841500," So as going to be just X and let's try to run it."
841500,842500," So that didn't work."
842500,846500," As you can see, uh, that definitely did not work."
846500,848500," And I accidentally kill my entire terminal."
848500,849500," So let's actually go to here."
849500,857500," Uh, so before I actually want to maximize my window windows max, uh, maximizing the window."
857500,862500," And I'm going to go to here and then to here, because one thing I forgot, I forgot to actually"
862500,865500," chop off the, uh, the comma, right?"
865500,870500," So I have to do SV chop, uh, left SV that will chop a single character out of that."
870500,871500," And there we go."
871500,876500," We have, uh, I suppose 16, one, two, zero, and it ends with 14."
876500,877500," Uh, right."
877500,879500," Let me actually confirm that that's basically the case."
879500,880500," Yeah."
880500,881500," 16."
881500,882500," And then ends with 14."
882500,886500," We actually read everything, uh, correctly, more or less correctly."
886500,894500," So, and essentially, uh, what I want to do, uh, maybe I want to collect all of the unique"
894500,898500," values, uh, of this stuff."
898500,903500," Um, let me see, uh, right."
903500,910500," If I build, uh, like a various, uh, simple code, uh, I 64, AKA beast."
910500,912500," Thank you so much for at which price of Christian."
912500,913500," Thank you."
913500,913500," Thank you."
913500,914500," Thank you."
914500,915500," And welcome to our epic."
915500,917500," AOC in Holy sea club."
917500,918500," That's right."
918500,921500," Uh, AOC and Holy sea."
921500,924500," So I want to have something like mean and max, uh, right."
924500,932500," So, and mean, Oh, is there something like, um, I know, uh, max int or int, uh, like,"
932500,934500," uh, like I 64."
934500,935500," Oh yeah."
935500,937500," So Terry actually defined all of this constant."
937500,938500," This is actually very lovely."
938500,943500," So yeah, uh, I, uh, I 64 mean I 64 max, and I can use all of that."
943500,944500," So thank you."
944500,945500," Thank you, Terry."
945500,946500," Very cool."
946500,947500," Uh, so I 64."
947500,951500," So minimum has to be I 64, uh, maximum, right?"
951500,957500," So, and this thing has to be, uh, I 64, uh, minimum instead."
957500,960500," And something, something is really weird."
960500,961500," I 64."
961500,963500," Uh, I cannot type anymore."
963500,968500," So I went into really weird mode where I can't type shit for whatever reason."
968500,969500," Uh, okay."
969500,970500," Uh, okay."
970500,971500," So I can type it again."
971500,972500," Uh, I 64."
972500,976500," Sometimes you just press something in temple of us and it stops working without telling you"
976500,979500," what, and it just like assumes that, you know, why, right?"
979500,981500," Because that's kind of the point of temple of us, right?"
981500,982500," You have to know what you're doing."
982500,985500," If you don't know what you're doing, you better don't use this thing."
985500,987500," Uh, all right."
987500,991500," So here, what I'm going to do, I'm going to just reassign."
991500,996500," So this is the minimum is going to mean I 64 between minimum and X."
996500,1001500," And the same goes for the maximum MX, uh, max, I 64, a max X."
1001500,1002500," There we go."
1002500,1005500," So, and then maybe it makes sense to remove this entire thing."
1005500,1008500," And I just want to see, uh, what's the minimum value and what's the maximum."
1008500,1010500," So minimum is going to be this, right?"
1010500,1016500," So I'm going to be MN and the maximum is going to be, uh, this, uh, a max."
1016500,1019500," And if I run it, uh, minimum, uh, is zero, right?"
1019500,1020500," So minimum is zero."
1020500,1023500," I wonder if I can use a zoom feature in here."
1023500,1024500," Uh, yeah, I can."
1024500,1025500," Okay."
1025500,1026500," So it's actually kind of cool."
1026500,1027500," It zooms in the cursor."
1027500,1032500," So it makes it super easy for me to just zoom on something just to show something."
1032500,1034500," This is actually very cool, right?"
1034500,1038500," So the minimum value here is zero and the maximum is 16, but this is for the sample, right?"
1038500,1040500," So this is for the sample, right?"
1040500,1041500," So this is for the sample."
1041500,1043500," What we want to do, we want to see like also the input, right?"
1043500,1045500," So let's actually take a look at the inputs."
1045500,1047500," Uh, so I'm going to run this entire thing."
1047500,1049500," And then, uh, okay."
1049500,1051500," So this is going to be plus."
1051500,1053500," So the maximum value is this one."
1053500,1059500," So we can save this, maybe put the upper boundary to two thousands, I suppose."
1059500,1061500," So this is one of the things we can do."
1061500,1065500," We just like a put upper boundary to thousands and that's fine."
1065500,1068500," At least for our data, if you know what I'm talking about."
1068500,1069500," Okay."
1069500,1070500," Um, all right."
1070500,1072500," So that's pretty POG."
1072500,1078500," Um, so let's define something like upper bound, right?"
1078500,1079500," Upper bound."
1079500,1081500," And it's going to be 2000, right?"
1081500,1083500," I don't know why I pressed escape in here."
1083500,1090500," Um, so, and I'm going to actually be like a similar table, uh, as for the day six, I think."
1090500,1091500," Uh, right."
1091500,1094500," Just a second, just a second."
1094500,1099500," Uh, so it's going to be I 64, uh, table, right?"
1099500,1101500," Upper bound."
1101500,1104500," And essentially I'm going to just build the histogram in here."
1104500,1109500," Uh, so first thing we want to do, we want to mem set, uh, the table."
1109500,1110500," Uh, we've got a subscription."
1110500,1112500," Uh, we've got a subscription, Linda Braga."
1112500,1114500," Thank you so much for 13 months."
1114500,1115500," Uh, indeed."
1115500,1118500," Thank you so much for 13 months of, uh, Twitch Prime subscription."
1118500,1119500," Thank you."
1119500,1119500," Thank you."
1119500,1120500," Thank you."
1120500,1123500," And welcome to our epic AOC in Holy sea club."
1123500,1124500," That's right."
1124500,1129500," AOC in holy mother flipping sea."
1129500,1130500," Anyway."
1130500,1131500," So we're going to set it."
1131500,1132500," Oh, shit."
1132500,1136500," I was actually, I started to type code in the chat instead of the, uh, instead of the template."
1136500,1137500," Okay."
1137500,1142500," So I'm going to set it to zero and then I'm going to take size of, uh, I 64 and I'm going"
1142500,1143500," to multiply it by upper."
1143500,1144500," You know what?"
1144500,1148500," I think, I think you can just do something like size of table, right?"
1148500,1151500," Uh, I think it works exactly like in C, right?"
1151500,1154500," I remember that I already checked that, but I already forgot."
1154500,1155500," Right."
1155500,1164500," So if I do something like, uh, size, size of table, uh, is equal to this, then I can do"
1164500,1165500," size of table."
1165500,1166500," Uh, right."
1166500,1168500," And if I run it, uh, right."
1168500,1170500," So yeah, it works."
1170500,1171500," Look at that."
1171500,1172500," Uh, I think it works."
1172500,1174500," Uh, yeah."
1174500,1178500," So it's 16,000, which is exactly the size of that thing."
1178500,1182500," I need to get used to that zoom feature because it's extremely useful for explaining things."
1182500,1183500," Right."
1183500,1188500," So while you type in the code, it is not really that necessary to zoom in really, uh, really"
1188500,1189500," close."
1189500,1192500," But once you've done something and show a result, it's actually very useful to just zoom in on"
1192500,1195500," something and just like tell the other people who's watching."
1195500,1201500," Um, so it's a pretty cool, uh, operating system for like educational purposes, like explaining"
1201500,1202500," something, right?"
1202500,1206500," When you teach in programming to somebody, uh, I think it's kind of cool."
1206500,1208500," Oh, and another interesting idea."
1208500,1215500," So these operating system has an ability to draw graphics out of the box, right?"
1215500,1216500," Out of the box."
1216500,1218500," You can just like start drawing things on the screen."
1218500,1224500," And I'm constantly thinking, will I ever have an opportunity to use that in advent of code?"
1224500,1229500," Essentially, maybe I'll have some sort of a problem that requires like very complicated"
1229500,1234500," visualization, not really complicated, but continuous visualization, not just cells, but an actual"
1234500,1238500," like, uh, you know, uh, continuous, uh, you know, function graphics."
1238500,1243500," And could I use the ability of TempleOS to visualize things to my advantage, just to debug"
1243500,1244500," something?"
1244500,1245500," That would be kind of cool."
1245500,1250500," Uh, yeah, because you don't need to install any libraries or anything like that."
1250500,1253500," The ability to draw things on the screen is part of the operating system that you can't"
1253500,1256500," use right away, right in your code."
1256500,1258500," I don't know yet how, right?"
1258500,1262500," So I think you have to create like a graphical context for the current task."
1262500,1267500," And once you have that graphical context, you can pass it to functions that can draw things"
1267500,1268500," on the screen."
1268500,1272500," Um, but we can always look into one of the games, right?"
1272500,1275500," So it comes with a lot of games that do a lot of graphics."
1275500,1278500," So at some point, if we need to draw something on the screen, we can just look into the code"
1278500,1281500," of the game and see how the game does that."
1281500,1283500," So, yeah, this is one of the things we can do."
1286500,1291500," Uh, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to."
1291500,1292500," All right."
1292500,1294500," Uh, wait, uh, TempleOS has a dark theme."
1294500,1297500," It has an ability to change themes, right?"
1297500,1299500," It has ability to change themes."
1299500,1304500," And I just basically took a groove box theme and ported it to TempleOS."
1304500,1305500," Right."
1305500,1307500," So that's what I did."
1307500,1308500," Hmm."
1308500,1312500," It's amazing how different this looks with just the palette swap."
1312500,1313500," Yeah."
1313500,1314500," It's amazing."
1314500,1315500," I don't know."
1315500,1321500," Like to be fair, one of the first color themes of the TempleOS when it was not called TempleOS"
1321500,1324500," was actually kind of okay."
1324500,1328500," It was still bright, but it was not like acidic bright."
1328500,1330500," If you know what I'm talking about."
1330500,1335500," Uh, at some point Terry made a very strange decision on the color palette."
1335500,1336500," Not going to lie."
1336500,1340500," Uh, so yeah."
1340500,1345500," So there is a very cool video, by the way, just a second."
1345500,1347500," Ah, this is the video."
1347500,1349500," I can't pause it for some reason."
1349500,1350500," Uh, okay."
1350500,1358500," So this is the video basically from 2010, the video from 2010, where Terry, uh, basically demos"
1358500,1364500," loose thoughts, uh, before it was renamed like several times and before his schizophrenia"
1364500,1365500," completely took him over."
1365500,1367500," It's actually very fascinating video."
1367500,1373500," It is very interesting to listen to Terry when he was saying it is very interesting."
1373500,1375500," And this demo is actually very useful."
1375500,1381500," A lot of things he's demos in this video, they're still applicable to TempleOS today."
1381500,1385500," So a lot of features that he shows here, they are still works in TempleOS."
1385500,1392500," Uh, so, and look, so this is the theme that was in TempleOS, uh, like back then."
1392500,1393500," And it was all right."
1393500,1396500," The shades of blue are actually more or less pleasant."
1396500,1400500," And he played nice with like purple and white in here."
1400500,1406500," But at some point something happened and he changed everything to completely tasteless colors,"
1406500,1414500," like completely like solid colors, like, you know, absolute bright, like absolute blue, absolute red and stuff like that."
1414500,1415500," So it's kind of weird."
1415500,1416500," Like what happened?"
1416500,1421500," Uh, so I'm going to give the link to this video in the description because it's, it's really interesting video."
1421500,1426500," Um, loose those demo from 2010."
1426500,1437500," Um, so, uh, to, to, to, to, to our dots links, they're kind of links to macros, right?"
1437500,1444500," So basically things that are clickable in TempleOS, they're macros that execute some code, right?"
1444500,1450500," So this is a macro that executes the code that lets you go higher in the hierarchy of the folders, right?"
1450500,1458500," And by clicking the, uh, file, you basically execute a macro that executes the, uh, like opening the file editor or something like that."
1458500,1460500," So this is basically how it works."
1460500,1462500," Uh, if I understand correctly."
1462500,1463500," Anyways."
1463500,1466500," So, uh, let's continue developing this thing."
1473500,1483500," So, uh, now what I want to do is essentially, I want to use X as an index in the table and I want to increment, uh, everything in here."
1483500,1491500," So after that, uh, maybe we want to be able to dump the table and see how many of the values in the table we have."
1491500,1492500," Right."
1492500,1497500," So let's actually define a thing called, uh, dump table, right?"
1497500,1500500," It can be something like that."
1500500,1508500," And since there is a lot of values in that table, I think I'm going to skip, uh, the ones that are zero because we're going to assume that they don't exist."
1508500,1509500," Essentially."
1509500,1515500," Uh, I 64, I, and for I equals zero, uh, less than upper bound."
1515500,1516500," Right."
1516500,1525500," So this is the upper bound plus I and, uh, if table I is greater than zero, right?"
1525500,1528500," Uh, what we're going to be doing, we're going to be doing the following thing."
1528500,1537500," Uh, so I'm going to essentially put four in here because some of the values are going to be like four digits."
1537500,1538500," Uh, right."
1538500,1541500," And then I'm going to have like something like this in here."
1541500,1546500," So this is going to be I and, uh, then the second value is going to be table I."
1546500,1547500," So there we go."
1547500,1548500," Uh, okay."
1548500,1550500," So here's the mean and max."
1550500,1554500," And, uh, I'm not sure if I care about these things, but I'm going to keep them just in case."
1554500,1558500," So this is going to be 10 dump table, uh, right, but a dump table."
1558500,1561500," And first I want to take a look at the, uh, at the sample, right?"
1561500,1565500," So if we take a look at the sample, I forgot a new line as usual."
1565500,1567500," Of course, of course I forgot the new line."
1570500,1571500," Uh, so there we go."
1571500,1573500," So this is basically how it looks like."
1573500,1578500," Uh, so this is like, we have three twos, uh, one 14, one 16."
1578500,1581500," And this is basically like, uh, everything that we have in here."
1581500,1582500," Right."
1582500,1583500," So that makes sense."
1583500,1584500," Okay."
1584500,1586500," Let's take a look at the, uh, at the input data."
1586500,1589500," Now, if I, if I go back to it because accidentally quit it."
1589500,1590500," Uh, all right."
1590500,1593500," So, uh, let's go here and this is going to be zero."
1593500,1594500," And this is going to be zero."
1594500,1598500," Um, oh boy."
1598500,1603500," Uh, I have no idea what the hell is going on."
1603500,1607500," Some shift down."
1607500,1608500," I don't keep shift."
1608500,1611500," It's almost like some sort of a sticky."
1611500,1612500," Okay."
1612500,1613500," Let me restart this."
1613500,1614500," I don't know."
1614500,1619500," The shift sort of sticked and, uh, it keeps holding it for whatever reason."
1619500,1620500," I don't know why."
1620500,1622500," Uh, it's like really weird."
1622500,1624500," Uh, just a second."
1624500,1627500," Uh, still cannot get used to it."
1627500,1628500," Uh, right."
1628500,1632500," And especially works really weird in the virtual machine, you know?"
1632500,1633500," Right."
1633500,1638500," Maybe if it was native, maybe it wouldn't be that bad, but I mean, it's kind of weird anyway."
1638500,1642500," So I also have this ampersand, uh, let me remove that ampersand."
1642500,1646500," And the thing I want you to do, I just want you to replace this one with zero and like do"
1646500,1647500," something like this."
1647500,1648500," There we go."
1648500,1650500," So these are the things that we have."
1650500,1651500," These are the values."
1651500,1656500," And, uh, we don't really have that many values repeating, as you can see."
1656500,1659500," So there is like a two, uh, right."
1659500,1661500," So there's also maximum."
1661500,1664500," There is only two, right?"
1664500,1666500," So, and here is an interesting thing."
1666500,1672500," So sometimes there's three, uh, let's actually answer like a different question."
1672500,1676500," How many values bigger than one we have, right?"
1676500,1678500," This is a very interesting question."
1678500,1679500," So there's a lot of them."
1679500,1681500," So there's, there are repetitions in here."
1681500,1684500," As you can see, there are some repetitions."
1684500,1687500," Uh, not quite a few repetitions, right?"
1687500,1690500," So sometimes you even, you even have the nine of them, right?"
1690500,1692500," Sometimes you even have nine of them."
1692500,1693500," Uh, okay."
1693500,1694500," So that's fine."
1694500,1697500," And how many of them that are bigger than two?"
1697500,1698500," Uh, right."
1698500,1700500," Do they even fit on the screen?"
1700500,1701500," Uh, do they even fit in the screen?"
1701500,1704500," They do in fact can fit into like one and a half of the screen."
1704500,1705500," Okay."
1705500,1709500," So there are some repetitions, but not that many of them."
1709500,1711500," Um, and all of them are fit in there."
1711500,1712500," Fine."
1712500,1717500," So I don't know if we can, uh, like use that, uh, for some data structure or something like that."
1717500,1722500," Um, okay."
1722500,1723500," Okay."
1723500,1727500," So what we have in here."
1727500,1728500," Hmm."
1728500,1738500," And essentially what we're going to do, we can now iterate through each individual value that is greater than zero."
1738500,1739500," Right."
1739500,1743500," And for that specific value, we can compute the amount of fuel, right?"
1743500,1752500," If you know the point to which you can align things, you can just go through each value, align things and see how much fuel it takes."
1752500,1753500," Right."
1753500,1756500," So, uh, let's actually write a function that does that."
1756500,1757500," All right."
1757500,1762500," So it's going to be I 64, uh, fuel, um, four."
1762500,1767500," Um, let's actually count something like, uh, called something like fuel count."
1767500,1768500," Right."
1768500,1771500," And, uh, we're going to accept alignment, right?"
1771500,1772500," Alignment."
1772500,1774500," Uh, I think it's a very big word."
1774500,1775500," Right."
1775500,1776500," Let's go align."
1776500,1777500," Uh, right."
1777500,1782500," And essentially it will basically compute the amount of fuel that is needed to align to these specific points."
1782500,1783500," You know what I'm talking about?"
1783500,1784500," Right."
1784500,1788500," We're going to have like, uh, I, and let's iterate through each individual thing in here."
1788500,1793500," So this is going to be, um, upper bound, right?"
1793500,1801500," Plus plus I, and we're only going to care about things that are, um, that are greater."
1801500,1802500," Um, then zero."
1802500,1803500," Right."
1803500,1807500," So we only care about those things greater than zero."
1807500,1813500," And, uh, so we also need to have a, uh, like a result variable."
1813500,1814500," So initially it's going to be zero."
1814500,1826500," Uh, uh, just a second, uh, result plus, and essentially what we can do, we can align minus."
1826500,1832500," Um, so I is a position in our case, right?"
1832500,1837500," Alignment minus I, and that's how much fuel you will need."
1837500,1841500," Uh, this is how much fuel you will need to just get to that point."
1841500,1842500," Uh, right."
1842500,1847500," We also want to kind of like do, um, you know, ABS, I 64, right?"
1847500,1849500," So you want to get rid of this sign."
1849500,1854500," Uh, and then, uh, since you have several of such crabs, um, you know, at that position,"
1854500,1856500," you want to multiply it by the amount of crabs."
1856500,1862500," And what's interesting is that if the amount of crabs is zero, the amount you'll add to"
1862500,1865500," the result is going to be zero, which kind of eliminates the need for this condition at"
1865500,1866500," all."
1866500,1867500," Right."
1867500,1868500," So we don't need this condition."
1868500,1870500," So we can just iterate and do that."
1870500,1872500," If I understood this entire thing correctly, of course."
1872500,1874500," Uh, right."
1874500,1880500," So yeah, essentially, I think, yeah, you just subtract it and you add it."
1880500,1881500," Yeah, there we go."
1881500,1884500," So, and then we can just return the result, right?"
1884500,1885500," So return the result."
1885500,1887500," And this is how you feel the count."
1887500,1892500," So now, uh, we can iterate through each individual value and just for each value that is greater"
1892500,1895500," than one, we can compute the fuel, right?"
1895500,1896500," We can compute the total fuel."
1896500,1898500," So let me get rid of these things."
1898500,1900500," I didn't think they're needed."
1900500,1901500," Uh, right."
1901500,1908500," So this is going to be I zero, I less than upper bound, uh, less than upper bound."
1908500,1916500," So plus plus I and, uh, if, uh, table I is greater than zero, that means for this entire"
1916500,1918500," thing, we want to count the fuel, right?"
1918500,1923500," So it's going to be fuel count, uh, for I, right."
1923500,1932500," Uh, fuel count for I, and, uh, we also probably want to, you know, have a result somewhere."
1932500,1933500," Uh, right."
1933500,1935500," So it's going to be I 64 results."
1935500,1936500," Right."
1936500,1937500," It's going to be zero."
1937500,1943500," Uh, so, and, uh, I can do, I mean, it's actually a pretty good idea."
1943500,1945500," Maybe, maybe I can just do mean and max because I already know that."
1945500,1947500," And max because I already have this values."
1947500,1948500," Uh, right."
1948500,1954500," So it's not going to improve the, uh, you know, the performance in any way."
1954500,1956500," It's still going to be linear."
1956500,1959500," Uh, but maybe it's a, it's an all right solution."
1959500,1960500," Okay."
1960500,1967500," So result is, has to be equal, uh, to, um, minimum, right?"
1967500,1968500," Minimum, right?"
1968500,1974500," Minimum I 64 results, uh, fuel count for I, and there we go."
1974500,1980500," So in here we can say something like part one, uh, D and can just put a result in here."
1980500,1982500," So that should be it."
1982500,1984500," If I understand everything correctly."
1984500,1989500," So let's actually go to sample and let's compute this into, I think, and it broke at the"
1989500,1990500," line 50, right?"
1990500,1993500," So it broke at the line 50 because why?"
1993500,1997500," Uh, I'm not quite sure because I don't have I, of course, that's why."
1997500,1998500," Right."
1998500,1999500," If I try to compute that one more time."
1999500,2000500," So it says zero."
2000500,2001500," Very cool."
2001500,2002500," Uh, very, very cool."
2002500,2003500," Uh, very, very cool."
2003500,2008500," So somewhere we're multiplying by zero or something like that."
2008500,2010500," Oh, this is because I I'm doing max."
2010500,2011500," I see."
2011500,2011500," I see."
2011500,2016500," So because I mean, so that means I have to do something like I 64, uh, max in here."
2016500,2018500," We already know that we have these things."
2018500,2019500," Uh, okay."
2019500,2021500," Uh, seven, uh, 37, right?"
2021500,2022500," Uh, let me take a look."
2022500,2024500," Is that the correct thing in here?"
2024500,2025500," Uh, 37, right?"
2025500,2028500," So that's basically what you have to do 37."
2028500,2031500," And what's interesting is that our brute force."
2031500,2033500," is square, right?"
2033500,2038500," So you perform thousands of iterations and within each iteration, you perform another thousand"
2038500,2039500," of iterations."
2039500,2043500," So basically you perform a million of iterations, which for the modern computers is okay."
2043500,2046500," We'll see if for the temple OS is also going to be okay."
2046500,2048500," Um, okay."
2048500,2049500," Should be fine though."
2049500,2050500," Should be fine."
2050500,2054500," A little bit nervous, uh, but, uh, probably shouldn't be."
2054500,2055500," Uh, okay."
2055500,2060500," So this is our probably final, uh, final answer."
2060500,2062500," Uh, I wish I could just like go here."
2062500,2066500," Uh, three, four, three, six, oh five."
2066500,2067500," All right."
2067500,2070500," So three, four, three, six, oh five."
2070500,2072500," And first try."
2072500,2073500," How about that?"
2073500,2074500," How about that?"
2074500,2076500," Bitch, you didn't expect that shit to happen."
2076500,2077500," So yeah, we did it."
2077500,2079500," We did it, boys and girls."
2079500,2080500," We did it."
2080500,2082500," And that was actually pretty cool."
2082500,2083500," Um, so yeah, it was pretty straightforward."
2083500,2085500," I didn't expect that."
2085500,2093500," Um, so for now the brute force kind of worked."
2093500,2097500," So let's actually do committee committee and maybe then even push it, push it."
2097500,2098500," How about that?"
2098500,2100500," Uh, so let me, let me take a look."
2100500,2101500," So get status."
2101500,2105500," I need to sync into the host AOC 2021."
2105500,2106500," Uh, all right."
2106500,2108500," So this is going to be the diff."
2108500,2110500," Uh, so also I want to take a look at the status."
2110500,2115500," I'm going to add, uh, home AOC, get status."
2115500,2119500," Uh, add day zero seven part one."
2119500,2122500," And I'm going to push that right into the repo."
2122500,2125500," Push origin, uh, master."
2125500,2126500," Mm."
2126500,2127500," Mm."
2127500,2128500," Mm."
2128500,2129500," Mm."
2129500,2130500," Mm."
2130500,2131500," Mm."
2131500,2132500," All righty."
2132500,2133500," Okay."
2133500,2138500," Uh, so the craps don't seem interested in your proposed solution."
2138500,2139500," Okay."
2139500,2143500," Perhaps you misunderstood the, uh, misunderstood crap in generic."
2143500,2149500," As it turns out, crap submarine, uh, and engines don't burn fuel at a constant rate."
2149500,2156500," Instead, each change of one step in a horizontal position costs one more unit of fuel than the"
2156500,2157500," last."
2157500,2160500," The first step costs, uh, one."
2160500,2161500," The second step costs two."
2161500,2164500," The third step costs three and so on."
2164500,2168500," Uh, as each car moves, uh, uh, moving further, become more expensive."
2168500,2172500," These changes the best horizontal position to align them all."
2172500,2174500," Uh, both of these becomes five."
2174500,2178500," Uh, I forgot the name of these things."
2178500,2183500," Arithmetic progression."
2183500,2195500," Uh, there's a formula that can compute arithmetic progression in, uh, all of one."
2195500,2200500," So essentially, if we apply the formula over arithmetic progression, we will keep the asymptotic"
2200500,2202500," of the current solution the same."
2202500,2207500," So yeah, that's, that's essentially, I guess that's the trick."
2207500,2208500," Maybe."
2208500,2210500," So essentially they're trying to trick us, right?"
2210500,2215500," So you have N squared and they try to make you think that now you have to do N cube."
2215500,2219500," And N cube is probably going to take some time, but maybe on the morning computers is going to,"
2219500,2226500," it's not going to take that much time because it's going to be like, um, um, billion, billion iterations."
2226500,2228500," And you can probably do that."
2228500,2229500," Right."
2229500,2232500," But you can bring it down to square just by using the arithmetic progression."
2232500,2233500," Right."
2233500,2235500," So this is one of the things you can probably do."
2235500,2236500," Uh, okay."
2236500,2238500," So, uh, arithmetic progression."
2238500,2243500," Uh, we'll see if we can apply that arithmetic progression."
2243500,2251500," So, uh, as each crab moves further, this changes the best horizontal position to align them all"
2251500,2254500," on an example of all these becomes five."
2254500,2255500," Okay."
2255500,2258500," So this cost a total of one, uh, 68 fuel."
2258500,2261500," This is the new cheapest possible outcome."
2261500,2265500," The all on position to now cost two and six fuel instead."
2265500,2270500," They remind the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible."
2270500,2273500," So they can make you an escape route."
2273500,2275500," How much fuel must they spend to align in that position?"
2275500,2276500," Okay."
2276500,2277500," So let's give it a try."
2277500,2278500," My comrades."
2278500,2283500," Um, all right."
2283500,2284500," So, uh, let me see."
2284500,2287500," So it's going to be AOC to 2021."
2287500,2289500," Uh, there we go."
2289500,2295500," Uh, so, uh, I'm going to, I already in the, in the correct folder."
2295500,2298500," I think, I think I am already in the correct folder."
2298500,2302500," So let me go in here and then in here."
2302500,2308500," Uh, so, uh, this is a fuel count that counts things for the part one."
2308500,2311500," So maybe we want to rename that, uh, slightly."
2311500,2316500," Maybe we want to rename that, but, um, another thing we can probably do."
2316500,2321500," Uh, another thing we can probably do, we can, uh, extract, uh, read input function."
2321500,2322500," Yeah."
2322500,2323500," I think this is a good idea, right?"
2323500,2327500," So let's actually do something like you zero, uh, read the input, right?"
2327500,2328500," So, and it's essentially does."
2328500,2330500," It will just read the input."
2330500,2331500," Um, right."
2331500,2334500," It will open the file and shit like that."
2334500,2337500," So, uh, let's actually bring this thing in here."
2337500,2340500," Uh, so we open in everything in here."
2340500,2341500," Uh, then."
2341500,2352500," Uh, we are just iterating and we're just iterating and then we should not forget to free, uh, this"
2352500,2353500," entire stuff."
2353500,2354500," Uh, right."
2354500,2355500," Uh, right."
2355500,2362500," So, and essentially we can merge fuel count with part one, because how we count the fuel"
2362500,2365500," is essentially the part itself, right?"
2365500,2370500," So, uh, I can probably make it, uh, make it a part of this stuff."
2370500,2373500," So I'm going to make it as I originally wanted, right?"
2373500,2376500," So it's going to be upper, uh, upper bound."
2376500,2377500," Right."
2377500,2384500," And then if, uh, this thing is that, um, I don't know."
2384500,2389500," So maybe I'm going to call it fuel count one because I don't want to do too much refactoring."
2389500,2390500," Uh, right."
2390500,2393500," So this is going to be fuel count one."
2393500,2394500," Uh, okay."
2394500,2399500," So this is fuel count one, uh, and in here, uh, right."
2399500,2401500," This is going to be read input."
2401500,2404500," So we read the input and that's it."
2404500,2407500," So we probably don't need that stuff in here."
2407500,2408500," Um, right."
2408500,2411500," And because of that, we don't need that stuff in here."
2411500,2416500," Uh, result, result might be useful only for this thing, right?"
2416500,2421500," So it is useful only for this thing, uh, for the read input."
2421500,2423500," I is not particularly useful."
2423500,2425500," So I'm going to actually bring it here."
2425500,2430500," Uh, I 64 I, and I think that is it."
2430500,2432500," Uh, I didn't see anything else in here."
2432500,2435500," Let me actually try to run it and actually refactor everything correctly."
2435500,2437500," First try, by the way."
2437500,2439500," And the compiler didn't even complain about that."
2439500,2440500," That's cool."
2440500,2441500," Uh, okay."
2441500,2442500," So we're going to do part two."
2442500,2443500," So I'm going to rename this thing."
2443500,2448500," And the first thing I want to do, of course, in a part two is read the input, right?"
2448500,2450500," So I'm just reading the input."
2450500,2455500," Uh, then for I zero, I do I upper bound."
2455500,2456500," You know what?"
2456500,2457500," I can copy paste this entire thing."
2457500,2458500," I mean, come on."
2458500,2464500," The only difference between these two functions is going to be that, uh, instead of count one,"
2464500,2466500," I'm going to be using count two, right?"
2466500,2469500," So, and part one becomes part two."
2469500,2474500," Uh, and also we probably want to keep this entire thing here as well."
2474500,2476500," We want to predefined this variables, right?"
2476500,2481500," So if I try to do that, it will say that, uh, function does not exist probably, but, uh, yeah,"
2481500,2484500," let's actually quickly define such function in here."
2484500,2488500," Uh, I 64 fuel count, uh, two, right?"
2488500,2491500," So I'm using second one, uh, I 64 align."
2491500,2492500," Uh, right."
2492500,2495500," So this is going to be something like this."
2495500,2497500," I 64, I, you know what?"
2497500,2501500," I'm going to just return zero for now just to see if this entire thing compiles."
2501500,2502500," Uh, okay."
2502500,2503500," So we have unused variables."
2503500,2507500," Oh, I remember I saw in the source code of TempleOS."
2507500,2513500," Um, I think there was like a warn unused, uh, or unused war."
2513500,2516500," Uh, warn, uh, unused warn."
2516500,2520500," Uh, there was a way to actually suppress that warning, but I forgot how to do that."
2520500,2522500," So there was a way to do this kind of stuff."
2522500,2526500," So, uh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
2526500,2530500," Okay, good."
2530500,2531500," So let's go."
2531500,2537500," Uh, it's going to be I 64 I, and then I'm going to do I 64 results zero."
2537500,2540500," Uh, and in here, I'm going to do the following thing."
2540500,2547500," I zero, uh, less than upper bound, uh, less than upper bound plus plus five."
2547500,2553500," Uh, and what I'm thinking is, um, what I'm thinking is."
2553500,2557500," Oh, shit."
2557500,2561500," Um, so I have like two points, right?"
2561500,2569500," Uh, a and B, uh, is there any formula for arithmetic progression that can start at arbitrary positions?"
2569500,2570500," Right."
2570500,2572500," You know, uh, I think that's it."
2572500,2574500," This sum, uh, okay."
2574500,2576500," Uh, for example, consider the sum to five."
2576500,2579500," The sum can be found quickly by taking the numbers."
2579500,2582500," Uh, all right."
2582500,2583500," Mm."
2583500,2584500," Mm."
2584500,2585500," Mm."
2585500,2586500," Mm."
2586500,2587500," Mm."
2587500,2588500," Mm."
2588500,2589500," Mm."
2589500,2590500," Mm."
2590500,2591500," Ah."
2591500,2594500," Derivation."
2594500,2596500," Of our nation."
2596500,2608500," Uh, so I'm not quite sure to be fair, because I kind of remember the way you can infer, uh, the arithmetic progression formula."
2608500,2611500," Uh, no one name of the variable."
2611500,2612500," Thank you for Googling that."
2612500,2613500," Thank you so much."
2613500,2616500," Uh, I have no access to the Google and thank you so much for Googling that."
2616500,2617500," Okay."
2617500,2619500," So, uh, let me open my paint."
2619500,2623500," Do you guys remember how you can infer the arithmetic progression formula?"
2623500,2631500," Uh, because it's kind of interesting because Gauss managed to do that when he was in fifth grade or something."
2631500,2632500," Right?"
2632500,2634500," Do you guys know that story?"
2634500,2635500," Do you guys know the story?"
2635500,2638500," How this like formula was found by Gauss?"
2638500,2640500," Because it's quite fascinating."
2640500,2641500," I think."
2641500,2645500," Um, no."
2645500,2647500," So, uh, let me actually take a look at the history."
2647500,2648500," So, yeah."
2648500,2660500," According to the anecdote of uncertain reliability, of course, young Carl Friedrich Gauss in primary school reinvented this method to compute the sum of the integers from one to one hundred by multiplying blah, blah, blah, blah."
2660500,2663500," Uh, however, Gladys of the truth of the story was not the first to discover this formula."
2663500,2664500," Okay."
2664500,2672500," So at least this is what our math teacher told us is that, that, uh, the teacher, right."
2672500,2681500," Uh, who was teaching like Gauss and the class where the Gauss was teaching, was, uh, studying, uh, they needed to go somewhere."
2681500,2682500," Right."
2682500,2684500," So they needed to leave the class."
2684500,2691500," So, and then the teacher came up with a problem to keep the, uh, the kids busy while they're absent."
2691500,2692500," Right."
2692500,2693500," And they came up with a problem."
2693500,2693500," Okay."
2693500,2695500," Count the sum from one to one hundred."
2695500,2696500," Right."
2696500,2701500," And, uh, so whoever comes like first or whatever, they will get a good grade or something."
2701500,2703500," So the Gauss did that like in, in five minutes."
2703500,2710500," Uh, he basically reinvented the formula and just like computed some from one to one hundred, uh, in all of one, essentially."
2710500,2713500," And the way he did it is actually really interesting."
2713500,2720500," So, uh, you can take a sequence of numbers from, uh, one to one hundred."
2720500,2721500," Right."
2721500,2726500," And then you take the same sequence and you write it in the opposite direction."
2726500,2726500," Right."
2726500,2734500," So you do, uh, one hundred, then ninety-nine, then, um, right, ninety-eight."
2734500,2736500," And then here you have one."
2736500,2743500," So now look, if you look at the corresponding pairs and you sum up these pairs."
2743500,2746500," Uh, so the sum of these two pairs is going to be one hundred and one."
2746500,2749500," Uh, the sum of this pair is going to be one hundred and one."
2749500,2756500," The sum of this one is going to be one hundred and one, and you're going to have one hundreds, one hundred of one hundred and ones."
2756500,2757500," Right."
2757500,2760500," So at the end in here you're going to be, uh, you're going to have one hundred and one."
2760500,2762500," So essentially how many of these things you have?"
2762500,2765500," Uh, you have one hundred of one hundred and ones."
2765500,2769500," So what's the sum from one to one hundred?"
2769500,2773500," It's basically this by divided by two because you summed up two of these sequences."
2773500,2774500," Right."
2774500,2776500," And because of that, this thing is going to be 50/50."
2776500,2777500," Right."
2777500,2779500," So this is how he came up with this formula."
2779500,2784500," Allegedly, it's an anecdotal story, uh, of unreliable origin and stuff like that."
2784500,2786500," But that's how he came up with this thing."
2786500,2792500," Um, so yes, I think it's a pretty interesting story."
2792500,2800500," And actually it makes you kind of like easily remember how to like a restore this formula because it's a very simple approach."
2800500,2813500," Um, so, and I'm thinking, so in my case, I actually need to start not from one, but from some arbitrary."
2813500,2817500," a zero up until a n."
2817500,2822500," And the question is, can we come up with a similar formula for, and, you know, of course, of course."
2822500,2829500," Uh, so a zero is less or equal than, uh, like a n, uh, something like that."
2829500,2835500," And essentially to be fair, to be fair."
2835500,2836500," Yeah."
2836500,2837500," We don't need to do that."
2837500,2838500," Why did I think that we need to do that?"
2838500,2841500," I thought we need to sum up all of the positions."
2841500,2848500," So if you are at three and you need to go to five for some stupid reason, I thought that you need to do three plus four plus five."
2848500,2849500," No, you don't."
2849500,2853500," Essentially what you need to do, you need to find the distance between these things."
2853500,2858500," And then just like use the, the original formula over arithmetic, uh, progression and stuff like that."
2858500,2860500," So I think I'm stupid."
2860500,2862500," I think that's basically the case."
2862500,2872500," Average boiler enthusiast versus average girls and jewelry."
2872500,2873500," Yeah."
2873500,2880500," Uh, so I suppose that makes it even easier because I can just like plug this entire shit into this formula."
2880500,2885500," Uh, and, uh, yeah, that should be, that should be pretty easy."
2885500,2886500," I think."
2886500,2887500," Let's go."
2887500,2888500," It's me."
2888500,2889500," Girls."
2889500,2893500," What the fuck am I saying?"
2893500,2894500," Uh, all right."
2894500,2896500," So the first step costs one."
2896500,2899500," Uh, and if you have, so the, the, the general formula, right."
2899500,2902500," The general formula is the following."
2902500,2903500," All right."
2903500,2908500," Uh, it's N multiplied by N plus one, uh, divided by two."
2908500,2909500," Right."
2909500,2910500," So this is the general formula."
2910500,2913500," And in this case, N is just equal to 100, right?"
2913500,2917500," If N is equal to, uh, one, right?"
2917500,2920500," If N is equal to one, you're going to have, uh, one."
2920500,2922500," If you do two, you're going to have, okay."
2922500,2923500," So that's actually pretty straightforward."
2923500,2925500," Let's go ahead and code that."
2925500,2928500," Let's go back ahead and code that."
2928500,2929500," Okay."
2929500,2930500," Where's my templates."
2930500,2931500," Okay."
2931500,2938500," Uh, so, uh, I need to do a B S I 64, uh, a line minus a."
2938500,2941500," So, and that's basically the distance, right?"
2941500,2943500," So this is basically the N."
2943500,2945500," Uh, so I might as well actually define that N."
2945500,2948500," So it's a little bit easier for me to do this kind of stuff."
2948500,2952500," The question is if N is equal to zero, right?"
2952500,2956500," If N is equal to zero, the entire thing is going to be essentially zero."
2956500,2960500," So I don't have to worry about too much, uh, which is nice."
2960500,2961500," Very nice."
2961500,2969500," Uh, so then I can do N, uh, multiplied by N, uh, plus one, uh, divided by two."
2969500,2975500," I hope that the precedence of the operators in Holy C is the same as in the regular C, but"
2975500,2976500," you never know."
2976500,2979500," So I'm going to put parentheses here just in case."
2979500,2984500," The usual, usual precedence in, uh, C is that these kinds of operators are going to be executed"
2984500,2985500," from left to right."
2985500,2990500," So the first, this thing is going to be executed and then the division, but again, you never know."
2990500,2994500," Uh, it's better to be, uh, you know, safe than sorry."
2994500,2995500," I think this is how they say that."
2995500,2996500," All right."
2996500,2997500," And that gives us this value."
2997500,3002500," And, uh, essentially the next thing we need to do, we probably need to multiply it by the table."
3002500,3003500," Uh, right."
3003500,3007500," So this is going to be table I, and, uh, then we'll have to add it to the results."
3007500,3009500," Hopefully that will kind of work."
3009500,3011500," Uh, maybe."
3011500,3013500," All right."
3013500,3014500," Maybe we'll see."
3014500,3015500," We'll see."
3015500,3016500," The winner gets T that's for sure."
3016500,3020500," So, uh, let me actually switch to the sample, right?"
3020500,3022500," So we're going to take a look at the sample situation."
3022500,3025500," So part one is commented out part two is running."
3025500,3026500," So we read the input."
3026500,3030500," Then we're using fuel, uh, fuel count two and then fuel counter."
3030500,3031500," We use that."
3031500,3032500," So let's take a look."
3032500,3033500," So one handed and 70, right?"
3033500,3036500," So one handed and 70 is this."
3036500,3037500," No, it is not correct."
3037500,3038500," Of course."
3038500,3043500," Um, so, but it's kind of close."
3043500,3044500," It is kind of close."
3044500,3046500," So let me, let me see."
3046500,3048500," Let me see what we've got."
3048500,3051500," Let me see what we got."
3051500,3054500," Uh, two, two, two, two."
3054500,3057500," That is very, very strange."
3057500,3060500," Why would it be like that?"
3062500,3063500," Um, okay."
3063500,3067500," So, you know what?"
3067500,3071500," I think I want to make a small break and refill my water, uh, super quick."
3071500,3075500," And after the break, we're going to try to, uh, see where is the problem."
3075500,3076500," Right?"
3076500,3078500," So, um, all right."
3078500,3079500," All right."
3079500,3086500," So let's actually go ahead and try to see if our formula, uh, works, uh, for the current thing in here."
3086500,3088500," Uh, so Mantec 44."
3088500,3090500," Thank you so much for three prime television."
3090500,3090500," Thank you."
3090500,3091500," Thank you."
3091500,3092500," Thank you."
3092500,3095500," And welcome to our epic, uh, AUC in Holy C club."
3095500,3096500," That's right."
3096500,3097500," So that's what we're doing."
3097500,3099500," Uh, that's what it's all about."
3099500,3100500," That's what we've been waiting for."
3100500,3101500," That's what it's all about."
3101500,3105500," Oh, so let's actually do something like this."
3105500,3109500," Uh, I'm going to take N and I'm going to, uh, put six, uh, 16 in there."
3109500,3110500," Uh, right."
3110500,3114500," So this is going to be 16, um, 16 to five."
3114500,3122500," Might as well, by the way, just have something like, um, you know, 16 and five."
3122500,3123500," Right."
3123500,3126500," So this is what we have in here, 16 and five."
3126500,3133500," And because of that, the difference between them is going to be ABS I 64, uh, a minus B."
3133500,3134500," Right."
3134500,3135500," So this is basically what we've got."
3135500,3139500," And I can quite easily just maybe even print this entire thing."
3139500,3145500," So this is going to be D and, and if I run this stuff, as you can see, it's 11."
3145500,3149500," And I think it is correct to some, uh, to some extent."
3149500,3150500," Right."
3150500,3152500," So we can actually see what here it is."
3152500,3154500," So here is 11."
3154500,3157500," Uh, I'm trying to go back and zoom."
3157500,3158500," Okay."
3158500,3165500," So after that, uh, after that, um, we need to see, uh, what's going to be the"
3165500,3166500," final thing."
3166500,3172500," So I'm going to, uh, grab this thing and just like literally copy paste it."
3172500,3173500," Right."
3173500,3174500," I'm literally copy pasting it."
3174500,3176500," Uh, and I'm going to put it in here."
3176500,3181500," So the answer is going to be, maybe the fuel, uh, is going to be equal to D."
3181500,3182500," Right."
3182500,3184500," And, uh, we're going to put it in here."
3184500,3187500," So, uh, I copy paste it like an extra parent."
3187500,3189500," So let me quickly remove that."
3189500,3193500," So if I run this thing, uh, it did not work because I forgot the semicolon."
3193500,3196500," Of course, I forgot the semicolon and it's 66."
3196500,3197500," Uh, would you look at that?"
3197500,3199500," It is in fact a 66."
3199500,3204500," Uh, but now the question is, uh, what if we swap them around?"
3204500,3206500," So that should be correct."
3206500,3208500," So it is still 66."
3208500,3210500," Uh, but what if it's the same?"
3210500,3212500," Uh, it is also correct."
3212500,3214500," So I didn't see any problems in here."
3214500,3216500," So that's kind of strange."
3216500,3217500," Uh, right."
3217500,3218500," So it's going to be 15."
3218500,3221500," If you have like several of them, right?"
3221500,3222500," Two to five."
3222500,3223500," Right."
3223500,3225500," So we have two to five and two to five."
3225500,3226500," Uh, right."
3226500,3230500," So they consume the same amount of fuel so that you, that means you can just multiply them."
3230500,3231500," Uh, that should be fine."
3231500,3237500," So, so far I didn't see any mistakes in my logic, right?"
3237500,3242500," At least in the logic, but maybe there are some mistakes in the execution of this entire logic."
3242500,3243500," Right."
3243500,3244500," So maybe something there."
3244500,3245500," Okay."
3245500,3252500," So here is N, uh, and, uh, okay."
3252500,3255500," Result is zero."
3255500,3256500," Uh huh."
3256500,3257500," Uh huh."
3257500,3261500," So, and, okay."
3261500,3262500," So it's going to be one."
3262500,3264500," And it still says, okay."
3264500,3267500," So I need to actually run this thing."
3267500,3269500," So it's 17."
3269500,3270500," 17."
3270500,3273500," It is in fact 17."
3273500,3284500," So, um, so we can try to maybe trace, uh, everything, right?"
3284500,3288500," We can try to trace everything and just see if it works correctly."
3288500,3289500," Um, right."
3289500,3291500," So I'm going to do the following thing."
3291500,3298500," Um, so it is going to be, let's actually have something like, uh, fuel, right?"
3298500,3303500," And I'm going to assign, uh, the fuel to this thing."
3303500,3304500," Right."
3304500,3310500," And, uh, and plus one, uh, and then I'm going to wrap everything in here and divide by two."
3310500,3314500," So here is the fuel, uh, right?"
3314500,3319500," And then I should be able to get rid of that."
3319500,3320500," Here's the fuel."
3320500,3321500," All right."
3321500,3325500," So then, uh, we have the value, right?"
3325500,3327500," So here is the first value."
3327500,3333500," Uh, and then we have, uh, the, uh, the amount of these things, right?"
3333500,3345500," So this is going to be the count, um, you know, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm."
3345500,3353500," So just a second, just a second, uh, in the part two, instead of doing this thing, right?"
3353500,3359500," In a part two, instead of doing this thing, uh, I can probably, uh, just do something like"
3359500,3362500," this, uh, right?"
3362500,3368500," Just show me the fuel count two, uh, in the expected answer."
3368500,3370500," So an expected answer is going to be five."
3370500,3371500," Right."
3371500,3372500," Show me that."
3372500,3373500," Uh, all right."
3373500,3375500," So it's going to be 44, 41."
3375500,3377500," And in here, I just forgot the semicolon."
3377500,3378500," Right."
3378500,3380500," So, and I have a new sort."
3380500,3383500," Oh, it is correct."
3383500,3386500," 168."
3386500,3390500," So it actually computed everything correctly."
3390500,3391500," Right."
3391500,3392500," Uh, but it didn't."
3392500,3392500," All right."
3392500,3393500," Um, okay."
3393500,3394500," All right."
3394500,3396500," So did, if I got to initialize something."
3396500,3397500," Okay."
3397500,3398500," So if I remove this kind of stuff, uh, all right."
3398500,3399500," And then I just do the result."
3399500,3399500," Right."
3399500,3399500," And what we're doing in here, we're trying to find the minimum."
3399500,3399500," And the minimum here is this one."
3399500,3399500," Um, I'm very confused."
3399500,3400500," Um, I'm very confused."
3400500,3401500," Okay."
3401500,3402500," Okay."
3402500,3403500," Um, okay."
3403500,3404500," Okay."
3404500,3405500," All right."
3405500,3409500," So did, if I got to initialize something."
3409500,3410500," Okay."
3410500,3414500," So if I remove this kind of stuff, uh, all right."
3414500,3417500," And then I just do the result, right."
3417500,3422500," And what we're doing in here, we're trying to find the minimum and the minimum here is this"
3422500,3431500," one, uh, I'm very confused."
3431500,3435500," I'm very actually confused because the result here is this."
3435500,3436500," Right."
3436500,3441500," Uh, but if you like specifically do few."
3441500,3442500," Oh, I see."
3442500,3445500," Because I'm an idiot."
3445500,3450500," I'm, I'm ignoring the things that don't exist."
3450500,3455500," So basically in this particular situation, there could be, uh, places where."
3455500,3457500," Yeah."
3457500,3458500," Oh my God."
3458500,3459500," This one is."
3459500,3462500," So it worked for the first solution because this thing is linear."
3462500,3466500," As soon as you go into the arithmetic progressions, it could be all over the place."
3466500,3467500," Okay."
3467500,3468500," So let's actually do it like this."
3468500,3470500," So you have to simply remove this thing."
3470500,3472500," And, uh, there we go."
3472500,3473500," It's 168."
3473500,3475500," This is very interesting."
3475500,3476500," Uh, all right."
3476500,3479500," So, okay, nice."
3479500,3480500," Huh?"
3480500,3481500," I like that."
3481500,3483500," So the author actually get me."
3483500,3484500," Okay."
3484500,3486500," The author actually get me."
3486500,3491500," Uh, but I wonder is, will be there a situation when it would be cheaper to go?"
3491500,3495500," somewhere out of bounds or maybe to the negative."
3495500,3497500," We're going to just basically assume that maybe."
3497500,3502500," It's not going to force us to go out of bounds anywhere."
3502500,3503500," All right."
3503500,3508500," So, uh, let's quickly switch to the part, uh, part like the actual input."
3508500,3510500," And let's just run this entire thing."
3510500,3513500," And we have 96, 7, 4, 4, 9, 0, 4."
3513500,3514500," Uh, right."
3514500,3517500," So, and I wonder if that's the actual solution in here."
3517500,3518500," Maybe, maybe it is."
3518500,3519500," Who knows?"
3519500,3521500," Uh, let's actually start tapping it out."
3521500,3523500," Uh, so."
3523500,3524500," 96."
3524500,3526500," Hopefully it is the correct one."
3526500,3529500," If it's not, uh, we'll have to like troubleshoot a lot of shit in here."
3529500,3534500," Uh, 9, 0, 4, 96, 7, 4, 4, 9, 0, 4."
3534500,3535500," And."
3535500,3536500," First try."
3536500,3537500," How about that?"
3537500,3538500," Both of the parts."
3538500,3539500," Easy."
3539500,3540500," GG."
3540500,3541500," Mm-hmm."
3541500,3542500," We did it."
3542500,3543500," We actually did it."
3543500,3544500," All right."
3544500,3548500," So, uh, let's do a committee committee and maybe even a pushy pushy."
3548500,3549500," How about that?"
3549500,3550500," Alrighty."
3550500,3552500," So, uh, I usually like to do the thing where I just like, uh, uncomment both of the parts."
3552500,3555500," And if I run this into, I think here are both of the parts."
3555500,3556500," All right."
3556500,3557500," So we have both of the parts."
3557500,3558500," Both of the parts."
3558500,3559500," Okay."
3559500,3560500," It's not even that much code."
3560500,3563500," Uh, and it was much more pleasant, uh, to code with this color scheme."
3563500,3564500," Right."
3564500,3565500," Go with the, not scheme."
3565500,3566500," Because holy shit."
3566500,3571500," Like after like an hour of using the default color scheme, like I had a huge amount of stuff."
3571500,3575500," And it was much more pleasant, uh, to code with this color scheme."
3575500,3576500," Right."
3576500,3577500," Color with the, not scheme."
3577500,3578500," Because holy shit."
3578500,3582500," Like after like an hour of using the default color scheme, like I had a huge headache."
3582500,3585500," It's just like unbearable and now it is fine."
3585500,3586500," Right."
3586500,3587500," So how long I'm streaming already?"
3587500,3588500," Uh, just a second."
3588500,3590500," I'm streaming for one hour and it's actually fine."
3590500,3592500," So I don't have any headache right now."
3592500,3599500," Uh, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to conclusion AOC is too easy this year."
3599500,3600500," I wouldn't say so."
3600500,3601500," Right."
3601500,3604500," So I just happened to know about arithmetic progression."
3604500,3608500," Uh, so essentially there is still trick to this problem."
3608500,3611500," It's just like, you have to know about arithmetic progression."
3611500,3617500," If you don't know about arithmetic progressions, you essentially end up doing N cubed solution."
3617500,3618500," Uh, yeah."
3618500,3619500," Yanda."
3619500,3621500," Thank you so much for gifting five tier one subs."
3621500,3622500," Thank you."
3622500,3623500," Thank you."
3623500,3624500," Thank you."
3624500,3630500," Anyone who got the subs, uh, welcome to our epic AOC in holy sea, uh, moon post man."
3630500,3632500," Thank you so much for tier one subscription as well."
3632500,3635500," Uh, so yeah, essentially, right."
3635500,3640500," You have to know the trick and who knows how many of similar problems we're going to have in the future."
3640500,3641500," Right."
3641500,3647500," So maybe the next problem will rely on some sort of like a Chinese reminder theorem that you just have to know."
3647500,3650500," And if you don't know it, well, you're screwed essentially."
3650500,3651500," Right."
3651500,3656500," So maybe like in a couple of days is going to be some sort of a theorem that you just have to know."
3656500,3658500," Uh, so I don't know."
3658500,3659500," I don't know."
3659500,3662500," So this time I just happened to know about arithmetic progression."
3662500,3666500," And to be fair, arithmetic progression is like considered like a common knowledge."
3666500,3667500," Right."
3667500,3671500," So if you went to a school, you probably know about it, but at the same time you could have forgotten about it."
3671500,3677500," Uh, just like the fact that I know it just made it easier, but I could have, I'm like, might as well not know that."
3677500,3682500," Uh, so Chinese reminder theorem never problem after this."
3682500,3683500," Yeah, exactly."
3683500,3687500," Uh, so I wouldn't say this problem is particularly easy."
3687500,3688500," Right."
3688500,3690500," I think there is some twist to it."
3690500,3697500," Um, I think there is some twist to it and some people may find it difficult and not because they're stupid, by the way."
3697500,3703500," So, uh, but because they just don't know or forgotten about arithmetic, uh, progression."
3703500,3704500," Right."
3704500,3708500," Um, but I happen to remember it."
3708500,3710500," So it is what it is."
3710500,3716500," Um, yeah, if you know something, it is easy."
3716500,3718500," And if you don't know it, it's hard like hell."
3718500,3721500," Like, and I really don't like this kind of problems to be fair."
3721500,3722500," Right."
3722500,3725500," So to solve the problem easily, you just have to know something."
3725500,3733500," And unfortunately, a lot of IT companies like software development companies, they like to give these kind of problems on coding interviews."
3733500,3734500," Right."
3734500,3747500," Uh, and what's interesting is that the ideas that you have to know in these problems to solve those problems, they were not obvious by computer scientists that solved them at the time."
3747500,3755500," Some of the problems that the coding interview gives, they, I don't know, computer scientists thought about them for decades before coming up with the solution."
3755500,3764500," And if you don't know how to solve that problem, you are expected to actually replicate their decades of work on the spot, which is fucking unfair."
3764500,3765500," It is absolutely unfair."
3765500,3766500," It is absolutely unfair."
3766500,3767500," I absolutely despise that."
3767500,3776500," So, anyways, let's just actually commit our, our thing and continue."
3776500,3777500," Okay."
3777500,3778500," Okay."
3778500,3780500," So, I need to do sync."
3780500,3782500," Uh, and I need to sync that into the host."
3782500,3783500," Right."
3783500,3784500," Um."
3784500,3785500," Mm."
3785500,3786500," Mm."
3786500,3787500," Mm."
3787500,3788500," Mm."
3788500,3789500," Mm."
3789500,3790500," Mm."
3790500,3791500," So, we have that."
3791500,3798500," And status, git add, uh, not GTI, git add, uh, home, uh, git status."
3798500,3805500," I'm going to commit, um, add, uh, day zero seven part two, right?"
3805500,3808500," Add a day zero seven part two."
3808500,3811500," And I'm going to push that, uh, right into the repo."
3811500,3812500," Right."
3812500,3818500," So, uh, the source code for everything I do on these streams is available, uh, in the description."
3818500,3821500," If you're watching on YouTube and if you're watching live, I'm going to copy paste this"
3821500,3822500," thing in the description."
3822500,3823500," Right."
3823500,3829500," So, everything is available in that repo, including my sick, uh, colors, uh, theme for, uh, Temple"
3829500,3830500," OS."
3830500,3831500," Right."
3831500,3833500," So, uh, let me actually run this into, I think."
3833500,3842500," So, AOC 2021, uh, so yeah, this color theme is available in that repo, right?"
3842500,3845500," So basically it is located."
3845500,3847500," I think, I think it is located."
3847500,3853500," Uh, AOC 2021, uh, home, uh, theme dot HC."
3853500,3854500," There we go."
3854500,3855500," So here's the theme."
3855500,3858500," So here's the palette and here's the code that sets the palette."
3858500,3860500," So there is also a little bit of a hack in here."
3860500,3865500," So you might want to include that hack as well into your configuration, but that's about it."
3865500,3870500," That was the seventh day of, uh, AOC in Holy C."
