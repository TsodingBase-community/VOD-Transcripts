400,6080," Hi! Before I start today's episode, I would like to apologize in advance for all the video"
6080,11200," encoding problems. Because of the nature of what I'm about to do, there is a lot of small moving"
11200,17040," objects on the screen which completely ruins the encoding. I think Tom Scott can explain better"
17040,24320," than me, so I'll put the link to his video on the topic in the description. So I couldn't solve the"
24320,30960," problem. No matter how much bitrate I would throw at it, it still persists. But I still would like to"
30960,36160," upload today's episode because I think I said a lot of interesting and educational things,"
36160,41920," at least the things that I wanted to put out there. So I hope you'll enjoy it."
41920,49440," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreation programming session with Azozin. So today we continue"
49440,56000," working on Musializer, which is music visualizer we started to work some time ago. And it's a classical"
56000,64080," visualizer for music, right? Essentially what it does, it analyzes the frequency of the sound wave"
64080,70000," and does the FFT on that sound wave and just like displays each individual frequency."
70000,75920," It works, it works quite well. Nothing particularly special. People have done something like that"
77040,83440," many times in the past, right? So this is nothing new, right? But I decided to implement that anyway"
83440,89360," because I never implemented that. And how you're supposed to learn things if you just don't implement"
89360,95520," them because somebody already done that, right? So somebody done a lot of different things,"
95520,99520," so does that mean that you never have to learn these things? No, it doesn't make any sense to me."
99520,108640," So, right. So it works well. It works well. But from the visual, from the artistic point of view,"
108640,116240," it kind of sucks, honestly. Right. So from the technical point of view, we know that the math"
116240,124480," and everything works correctly and everything's fine. But visually, it's not that interesting to look at."
124480,129920," It's not even that pleasant to look at. Look at this green. It's just like, it sucks. It straight up sucks."
129920,138480," We need to fix that. So the first problem that I would like to address today is basically the"
138480,146800," visualization being so glitchy and jittery. In case of a cheap tune, it's fine, right? Because it's a fast-paced"
146800,153280," cheap tune. So it kind of suits this particular style of music. But if we take something less fast-paced,"
153280,161600," for example, I have this music from Pilot Red Sun, right? So it doesn't really suit it that well,"
161600,166400," right? As you can see, it just like jumps around and jitters and stuff like that. And it's just like"
166400,173360," something's flickering here, right? So I don't really like how it looks like. So and essentially,"
173360,181360," this is because on each individual frame, we're showing the immediate values of the frequencies. So"
181360,188080," essentially, we have this sort of like a ring buffer of samples of the sound. And periodically,"
188080,193840," we get new samples, and we sort of push them into that buffer. And then on each frame, we do an FFT on"
193840,199840," that entire thing. And we just immediately display whatever we got from FFT. And that is it, right?"
199840,206080," So and as far as I know, this is not even how majority of these visualizers even work, right? So they never"
206080,211680," display the immediate value. What they do, they basically keep track of the values from the"
211680,217200," previous frame and the current frame. And they sort of try to interpolate smoothly between these things,"
217200,224800," which results is in less jittering. And it just actually looks very smooth and nice and stuff like"
224800,230880," that. And this is something that we may try to do as well, right, as the first step in improving,"
230880,238800," you know, the visualization. I already done that on a stream, but unfortunately, I screwed up with the"
238800,248800," sound. So I was actually keeping my headphones too close to the microphone, which resulted in this thing"
248800,255840," being like not particularly watchable, in my opinion. Right. So this time I fixed that mistake, but I still want to"
255840,261120," walk through the process because I think it's pretty important to document it. So let's go ahead and do that."
261120,264560," It's actually not a big deal, right? So it's super easy to do."
264560,269760," Right. So let's go to the plug. Let's see."
270560,277520," And here we have several buffers that we work with, right? So for example, we have two input buffers and"
277520,284880," two output buffers. So the input row contains literally the samples that we receive periodically"
284880,293600," from the callback, which is called by the music subsystem, by the sound subsystem periodically."
293600,297600," Right. So periodically we receive some frames and we just like put them into this buffer."
298240,306000," So then we have in windowed buffer and essentially what it is, it's just like we take the row input"
306000,311440," and we multiply them by this hand value, which is basically the hand window function. For more"
311440,316000," information, what it is, I recommend watching the previous episode where we discussed all of that."
316000,321120," All of the episodes are going to be in the description, in the form of the playlist and stuff like that."
321120,329600," And then we take this windowed input and we do an FFT, which results in getting the row output,"
329600,337280," right? The row output. And what we do is that we actually squash that output on a logarithmic scale."
337280,342800," We don't display all of the samples because the human ear does not perceive the frequencies linearly,"
342800,347520," right? So we perceive them logarithmically. And that's what we're trying to do in here. Basically"
348400,353600," squashing them into like a small amount of frequency beams. So in reality, as far as I know,"
353600,359840," we have two to the power of 13 frequencies in here, but we don't display all of them, as you can see."
359840,365200," So this is definitely not to the power of 13, which is like, I think 8000, if I'm not mistaken."
365200,368960," Right. So two to the power of 13 is like, it's literally 8000 of them. Right."
369520,373840," So it doesn't look like 8000, that's for sure. So that's because we squash them."
373840,380800," Right. And we display smaller amount of them. And another interesting thing we do afterwards,"
380800,388080," we're normalizing them to a range from zero to one. And it's quite important because it makes it easier"
388080,394160," to interpolate and display it. Right. For example, in here, just because each individual bar in here is"
394160,400080," value from zero to one, it's super easy to multiply that value by two thirds and just map it to two"
400080,406880," thirds of the screen. Right. So for instance, if I want to, I can map it to half of the screen. Right."
406880,412480," And it's super easy to do. Right. So now it's only half of the screen. But personally, I kind of like"
412480,418240," like two thirds of the screen. I think it looks nice. Right. So and that's the power of basically"
418240,423920," normalized values. And afterwards, we just display all of that. Right. So that's basically what it is."
423920,432480," So the idea is, we can say that this is the immediate values that we got after FFT."
432480,437760," And let's actually introduce another buffer, which is going to be the smoothed values, the current values."
438640,446480," So when we finished computing and squashing and normalizing everything,"
446480,452320," one of the things we can do, we can essentially iterate through all of the samples we got."
452320,458960," So we get M samples. M is the amount of squashed samples. Right. So N is the amount of like the whole"
458960,464320," amount of samples, 8000. And M is basically the squashed one. So we have less samples in here."
465200,478640," And essentially we can say that log i is the target that log like smooth i should achieve."
478640,486320," Right. We can kind of compute the direction and the velocity in which out smooth house has to move"
486320,493520," by just basically subtracting them and right and just multiplying by dt. Right. So basically the delta"
493520,501600," time between the frames and essentially just add this entire thing to the out smooth. And when we're"
501600,507360," displaying everything, we're actually displaying out smooth. So yeah, essentially the immediate value"
507360,516080," kind of dictates the frequency. Right. It dictates the frequency. So, and to be fair, this kind of"
517040,525120," velocity is rather slow. So let me actually show you. So let me try to recompile this entire thing. So we"
525120,530960," don't have dt. Let's quickly compute it. So here on each individual frame, we already get the width and"
530960,537280," height of the window. So in here we can just get the dt, which is get frame time or time frame. I don't quite"
537280,543520," remember. That's it's a frame time. Okay. So yeah, as you can see, it's pretty slow. Right. It doesn't really"
543520,551360," keep up super well. We can multiply it by some sort of a factor to make it a little bit faster. We can multiply it"
551360,561760," by two. Right. So, and so like, yeah, it's already way better. We can multiply it by maybe four. Right."
561760,569760," The bigger that value is the closer it is to like jittering. Right. So we can even call this parameter"
569760,578640," something like smoothness. Smoothness and maybe extract it some way here. So like maybe let's put"
578640,585360," six in here. So this is a special parameter that we can work with. And to be fair, personally,"
585360,593840," I like the smoothness around eight. I think that's the perfect balance. And yeah. So that's basically"
593840,600240," how you smooth those values. You just keep track of them. And if we take a look at the fast paced chiptune,"
600240,607600," even the fast paced chiptune already looks nice. Right. Look at it."
612320,626400," That's so cool."
626400,639280," All right. So I don't really like this sort of like gaps between the bars. I think it's super easy to get"
639280,649520," rid of them. If we essentially take the cell width. Right. So cell width didn't really divide properly"
649520,655040," by M. Right. So essentially we take the size of the window and we divide it by the amount of like"
655040,661040," squashed samples that we have in here, but it didn't divide evenly. So that's what results in this sort of"
661040,667200," gaps. So what we can do, we can just put a seal on it and that should kind of solve the, yeah, there we go."
667200,674080," So the gaps are kind of solved. All right. So I really like how it looks like. So let's go back to a little bit"
674080,682640," like a slower paced music. Right. So as much as I like Null's songs, like absolutely love them. I'm a huge fan of Null's work."
682640,690080," Unfortunately, when you're trying to visualize chiptune, chiptune has a lot of"
690960,697040," harmonics as you can see in here. And this is because in chiptune, you primarily use square waves,"
697040,702000," right? And the sawtooth waves and stuff like that. And they result in a lot of harmonics. And because"
702000,707600," of that, when you're trying to do FFT visualization on them, they're just like turned into like a white"
707600,714960," noise. And it's just like, so like upsets me so much because I'm a huge fan of chiptune, but using FFT is just so"
714960,726240," hard to like visualize and, you know, give a proper treatment to this music. So maybe like using FFT for"
726240,731680," visualizing chiptune is just not a great idea. And you need to visualize chiptune completely differently."
732480,738000," Maybe just on the level of like individual notes, right? Because like a pure FFT results in"
738000,744880," in too many harmonics. By the way, if anyone knows how to solve that problem, please let me know in the"
744880,749920," comments, because maybe I'm just like not aware of some certain technique that you can apply along with"
749920,756560," FFT to get rid of unnecessary harmonics. Is there something like that? I'm pretty sure people been"
756560,762400," studying like in that area something, right? So just getting rid of unnecessary harmonics to just"
762400,768160," like display and visualize, you know, things like chiptune a little bit better. That would be"
768160,774880," interesting actually. It would be actually interesting. All right. So, and because of that, sometimes to test"
774880,781040," this entire thing properly, I need to resort to things that are not chiptune, unfortunately. Right."
781040,792320," Okay. So, all right. So since we are doing the artistic work, right? So what great artists"
792320,800480," artists usually do? Well, they still, right? Another idea that I would like to incorporate into,"
800480,807920," into the mutualizer, I actually saw on, on Twitter, right? So I'm going to keep the tweet in the description."
807920,816720," It is made by ""Rainbowism"", right? So they basically got inspired by my mutualizer series."
816720,828800," And they introduced like a spectrogram visualizer into their fantasy chip, I think. Unfortunately, I can't"
828800,835920," really access this tweet, right? Because it's on Twitter and Twitter is banned in my country because it contains a"
835920,844640," very dangerous native propaganda that my government is bad scared of. But I used a little bit of the"
844640,851520," VPN magic and I actually downloaded that video so I can show it on, on the, on the stream. It's not really"
851520,855760," a stream. It's offline session. But anyway, so I just want to show you, show you how it looks like."
855760,860720," Right. So let me make it a little bit smaller. So this is how it looks like."
861920,868640," So this is how dangerous native propaganda looks like. So yeah, so the idea here is that,"
868640,876240," so we basically map each individual bar to like a, to, to a rainbow color. And it looks super nice. I"
876240,882480," really like how it looks like. So, and as an artist, I'm going to steal that. Right. Thank you very much."
882640,894160," So, and that answers the questions whether, whether AI art is actually a real art. So you need to answer"
894160,903040," the question, is that a theft? If that's a theft, that's art. I'm joking. So anyway, so I really like"
903040,909040," this idea. It just like makes it like look good immediately. And it's actually super easy to"
909040,917920," implement. Right. So essentially you just iterate each individual bar and you map the iteration to"
917920,924240," a range from zero to one, the magical range, my favorite range. And then you use that range as a hue"
924800,933920," in a color, in a color space of HSV. Right. So hue saturation value. So, and"
940880,949040," that one, yes, of course, hue saturation value. Why is it in Russian? Can you just like give"
949040,957440," me a minute? Thank you very much. So, and essentially that color representation is actually very cool. I"
957440,963840," really like this color representation because for human beings, it is easier to reason about the colors"
963840,970800," in terms of HSL and HSV rather than in RGB. Right. Because here we have hue, which is"
970800,977200," the base color. Right. The base color. Saturation is basically the amount of that color, like how much"
977200,984320," of that color we have. And lightness is basically how bright or dark it is. And this is a very easy"
984320,990480," way for human brain to reason about the color. Like we think about, okay, here is the base color. And then"
990480,997040," tweaking saturation and lightness, I get the sort of like the right flavor of that color for my particular"
997040,1000720," situation. As with RGB, it's kind of difficult to do this kind of stuff. So,"
1000720,1008080," you constantly need to remember, like, what's the color of a mix of red and green? Is it yellow?"
1008080,1012640," Yeah, it is yellow. And if more than that, it's just like, it's too difficult for human brain."
1012640,1019920," So, but RGB is really great for storing the color in computers. So, I always say that RGB is for"
1019920,1030640," computers and HSL and HSV and stuff like that is for humans. Right. So, and because of that, it is super easy to map this sort of"
1030640,1038800," like a width space to a hue color space and just get this rainbowish effect like very, very easily."
1038800,1043440," So, let's go ahead and try to do this. I should be pretty straightforward. The music is too loud"
1043440,1050000," yet again. Keeping the right volume of the music is probably the hardest part of this series,"
1050000,1058480," right? Because quite often I may get zoned out and crank up the music too high and completely forget"
1058480,1064880," about it and ruin the entire world. It's just like so frustrating. I'm sorry. Anyway, so essentially here"
1064880,1073200," we're iterating from I to M and it should be very easy to just say, okay, the hue is going to be equal to"
1073200,1083680," I divided by M and there we go. So, as far as I know, in RayLib, there is a thing that converts, you know,"
1083680,1091680," HSV to RGB. And maybe what we can do, we can use Google to actually find that. Can I, can I do that?"
1092240,1099280," So, where is my Google? So, it's probably somewhere here. Yeah, here's the Google. And first thing I have"
1099280,1107520," to provide, I have to provide the path to RayLib, which is located somewhere here. So, RayLib. Yeah,"
1107520,1112320," there we go. And the thing, I know that the thing is supposed to return color and it accepts like three"
1112320,1119520," floats. Will it be able to find that? We should be able to find that. So, could not open file. Oh, yeah."
1119520,1126080," I'm really sorry. Just a second because I had experimentation with Google. So, let me quickly."
1126080,1131680," I need to recompile my Google. So, there we go. It should be fine."
1131680,1142720," And let's go back and I'm going to do that one more time. And there we go. So, the first, yeah,"
1142720,1149200," there we go. Color from HSV instantly, found instantly. That's why I developed Google, right? So, I can"
1149200,1154480," quickly, I don't remember the name of this entire thing, right? I don't remember. But I do remember"
1154480,1160560," this signature. How can I, yeah. I remember this signature. I know that it accepts three floats,"
1160560,1165840," hue, saturation value, and returns the color. Right. So, and that's what I said to the, to the search"
1165840,1172160," tool and it gave me like a call from HSV. So, it's very useful for this sort of like a fuzzy stuff,"
1172160,1177840," right? So, here it is. And I just can grab this entire thing. Yeah, there we go. Already using the"
1177840,1184720," tools that I created. So, this is the color. Here's the hue. And in terms of saturation, I don't know."
1185360,1192000," Let's actually bring them to separate parameters. Value is not necessarily equal to brightness to be"
1192000,1199440," fair. I don't really remember what is value. So, let's just keep them like this. And instead of green,"
1199440,1205200," instead of green, we're going to be using the color. So, let's, let's recompile this entire stuff. I have"
1205200,1213280," to go back. Where is the build? There we go. And it is red. It is absolutely red,"
1214000,1220720," which doesn't make any sense because I know why. Because this is like a reoccurring"
1220720,1230240," theme in RayLib is that every time you have an angle, it is actually in degrees rather than reds."
1230240,1238880," So, yeah, hue is the angle in a sort of like a coral wheel, color wheel. So, that's why it's from 0 to 360."
1238880,1246560," So, to get the right value of hue, we need to multiply this entire thing on by 360."
1246560,1254480," So, that's what we need to do in here. And we go. We got the rainbow. But it's too harsh, in my opinion."
1254480,1260000," So, can we actually... So, if I try to reduce the value, so what's going to happen? I'm really curious."
1260560,1266800," It kind of makes it darker. Okay. So, that probably makes sense. So, it's kind of like a brightness."
1266800,1274240," And I suppose value of 1 is the full brightness. Yeah. You see how easy it is to reason about the"
1274240,1280880," color in terms of like H3? It's super easy. So, and it's too saturated. I would like to make it less"
1280880,1288080," saturated. Maybe like 80%. That's already better. Maybe even a little bit more. Something like this."
1288080,1295920," Right. So, you basically pick the base color and you essentially just like modify that base color"
1295920,1297600," with two parameters. And it's really useful."
1297600,1306240," All right. So, that already looks so much nicer than whatever we had before. Seriously."
1306800,1311440," And we can even compare with whatever we had before. We can just stash"
1311440,1314640," the entire thing. And this is what we had before."
1314640,1323280," Literally. This is what we had before. And now, if we unstash and just like pop it in here,"
1323280,1328720," recompile it one more time. And this is what we have now. Like two simple changes. Just like smoothness"
1328720,1333440," and a little bit of like a color variation. And it's already interesting to look at. It's already like"
1333440,1339680," much better than it was before. It's kind of cool. So, this is what all like sort of like art is all"
1339680,1345760," about. Like these small little changes, small little details have so much impact sometimes. Right. So,"
1345760,1352800," I suppose the the job of the artist is finding these sort of like small tricks and small little tools"
1352800,1358880," that have a lot of impact and just like stir the whole thing to a right direction. So, I suppose that's"
1358880,1360640," what it means to be an artist."
1360640,1370880," So, let's do a commit to commit. All right. So, let me see. Maybe I can actually commit that"
1370880,1381360," separately. So, so here we're gonna have, you know, smooth, smooth interpolation. Smoothly interpolate,"
1381360,1398640," interpolate interpolate the frequency bars. Right. And steal a cool color idea from Twitter. So, this is"
1398640,1408800," another. Might as well actually give the link to whoever I stole it from. Right. So, let me quickly do that. So, this is"
1408800,1415440," basically where we stole it from. There we go. So, I'm gonna push that right into the repo. So, that's"
1415440,1422640," already better. But it's still, I think, not enough. Right. Still not enough to look particularly"
1422640,1432320," interesting or stand out. And I would like to implement the idea that been brewing for quite some time already."
1432320,1439920," Right. I was trying to come up with different sort of visualization ideas over the past like a week or so."
1439920,1445680," I've been experimenting with different stuff. And I settled on one interesting idea that I think"
1445680,1451520," is really good. I really like that idea. Right. So, essentially the gist of that idea."
1452400,1459040," So, let me actually pause this entire thing. And maybe get my paint. I think I already have my paint opened."
1459040,1470880," So, instead of like solid bars. Right. Instead of solid bars. What if we had circles. Right. We had circles"
1470880,1478880," on different heights. I already tried to do something like that. And it doesn't really work that well."
1478880,1485200," because the discrepancies between different frequencies might be huge. Right. So, but I like"
1485200,1492560," the idea of like using circles in the frequencies to represent the frequencies. But if there's too"
1492560,1498400," too much discrepancies, it just like doesn't look good. In fact, I can probably show you that. Right. I can"
1498400,1505680," probably show you that because I know the precise sort of like location and height of the bar which I can"
1505680,1512000," use to actually find the center of the circle. I can just literally render that circle. So, let me"
1512000,1524720," quickly try to do that. So, here we are drawing the rectangle. Drawing the rectangle. So, this is x of"
1524720,1533360," this entire thing. And this is y. Right. So, I think I can do something like this. So, center."
1533360,1541040," So, this is the current position. This is the current position. But we need to"
1541040,1547120," be at the center of the bars. So, because of that, I'm going to offset it by half of the"
1547120,1553120," of the width. And this is the height. Right. And the height is going to stay the same. Right. So,"
1553120,1560960," this is basically the height. And in here, I'm going to draw a circle. So, I wonder if I can quickly"
1560960,1572160," do that. So, do we have vector 2 void? It accepts the center radius and probably the color. Right. So,"
1572160,1578480," this entire thing probably would look like this. And there we go. Draw a circle. So, I literally found this"
1578480,1585360," entire thing. That's actually very cool. So, here's the circle. Radius is going to be cell width. And the"
1585360,1592000," color is going to be the current color that we complete from HSV. Right. And let me comment out"
1592000,1597760," the rectangle. Man, Google is so useful. Right. Because I don't remember the name with this thing. But I know"
1597760,1605200," that it accepts vector 2. You know, the radius and the color. Right. So, because it's a circle. Right."
1605200,1612480," So, let's review this entire thing. I'm in the wrong place. God damn it. God damn it. Okay. So, there we go."
1612480,1619920," Yeah. Using circles is just like kind of cool. But if there's a huge discrepancy between the"
1619920,1624640," frequencies, it's just like it turns into a mess. And it's just like not clear what the hell is going on."
1625840,1632160," Right. So, it's still kind of cool. Right. We can take a look at how it looks like when you do something like this."
1632160,1637200," Not bad, actually."
1645920,1657360," So, the way I want to resolve that is basically put them on a stick. Right. So, that way they combine"
1657360,1663600," the best of both worlds. Right. Using circles. Because I think using circles is just like visually appealing."
1663600,1669200," It's such like a perfect object. And there's a lot of them. So, it feels like a lot of particles and stuff"
1669200,1676480," like that. It's just like stimulates your brain. I really like that. And with sort of like them being"
1676480,1682560," on a stick creates this sort of feeling of these frequency bars. Of these equalizer frequency bars."
1682560,1689520," So, it kind of like combines the best of both worlds. Right. It's not really a bar anymore. But"
1690160,1696000," you still can feel the height of it. So, we can go ahead and try to do that. If I remember correctly."
1696000,1704960," ArrayLip literally has a function for rendering the lines. So, let's actually try to find that."
1705520,1713760," It probably accepts two vectors. Excuse me. So, let me see. I have to go somewhere here."
1713760,1722400," Draw a line. There we go. It's so easy to find. Okay. So, this is the start position."
1722400,1730000," End position and the color. So, we know the color. We know the start position, which is the center. We can"
1730000,1735520," actually rename center to the start position. Start position. There we go. I wonder if you can see"
1735520,1739440," everything. So, let's actually put it in here. Yeah, there we go. I think that's a little bit better."
1739440,1747440," So, the code is in here. Right. Excuse me. End visualization in here. So, it's quite important for"
1747440,1756560," you to see the full line. In the end position, I suppose, in terms of x, it's literally the same."
1757600,1767040," In terms of height, it's at the bottom. So, which means it's just like h. So, that's basically it."
1767040,1774080," I can't see choice in this. There we go. So, we have end position and the color. It would be nice to"
1774080,1778880," maybe render the line first. Right. Render the line first and then the circle next."
1781520,1787600," Just a second. Alright. So, let's go over here."
1787600,1800160," There we go. So, I'm not sure how well it looks on the screen. Maybe it actually creates a lot of like,"
1800160,1805200," how to say that, encoding artifacts and stuff like that, but it looks like this."
1805920,1810640," Because of that, I think the lines should be a little bit thicker. So, let's actually get rid of"
1810640,1814960," them. So, I don't know if they create a lot of like, encoding artifacts. So, just in case,"
1814960,1820240," I'm going to disable them. So, they don't ruin the video. And if I remember correctly,"
1823760,1831920," there was a variant of the line drawing the line that accepted the thickness."
1831920,1841760," Yeah. So, there was a Bezier line. I think it's basically XC. Yeah, there we go. So, there's this"
1841760,1848640," one, this thing that also accepts the thickness. Right. So, it accepts the start point, the end point,"
1849200,1855440," then the thickness and the color. So, how can we set the thickness? We can set the thickness literally"
1855440,1862000," to cell width, which will result in a very thick line. I think it's going to be the thickness of the"
1862000,1871440," entire, yeah, of the entire bar. Actually, no. But maybe, I don't really know. So, let me actually see."
1875600,1884960," So, it doesn't like something. Semicolon, of course. Yeah, it's too thick. It's the thickness of the"
1884960,1893840," entire bar. And plus, the, yeah, the radius of the circle is also too big. So, the actual radius"
1893840,1900640," has to be like half of that. Right now, they are actually matched perfectly. To be fair, the fact that"
1900640,1909520," they inter, like, overlap is actually quite good. Right. So, I think they're, yeah. Because we have"
1909520,1915840," so many frequencies, they are so crammed together, but they rarely are on the same height. So, because of"
1915840,1922480," that, the circles overlapping with each other is kind of fine. Right. We can actually make them even,"
1922480,1929840," like, overlap even more, like twice of that. So, that looks even more interesting. And in terms of"
1929840,1937520," thickness, we can take this, like, half of the thickness. Right. So, that already looks even more"
1937520,1946640," interesting, right? Right. We can maybe divide the thickness of this thing by three, even. I think it"
1946640,1954960," looks even more interesting if you, like, do full screen. Right. So, yeah. That already looks interesting."
1956480,1962000," So, but I think the radius is actually too huge, right? So, if I make it a little bit smaller."
1962000,1968640," Did it actually decrease it? Ah, I did the wrong thing. So, it's supposed to be like three."
1969760,1980480," And this one has to be like this. There we go. So, interestingly, maybe it makes sense"
1980480,1987760," to factor out those parameters like so. We're going to have float, and this is going to be thickness,"
1987760,1995760," which depends on the cell width. And then we're going to have a radius, which also depends on the cell width."
1995760,2004640," It's literally cell width. So, that way we know what kind of parameters we are modifying. Right. So,"
2004640,2009840," we know that the thickness is a third of the cell width, but the radius is the full thing in here."
2011280,2016160," Right. Okay. So, that already looks nice. So, let's take a look at some other music."
2016160,2026400," So, it's pretty cool. So, the thing I didn't like is when nothing is playing. Right."
2027520,2036400," They all line down flat in here. Right. Which is like kind of, kind of, maybe it's nice, but I don't want"
2036400,2044880," to see anything when nothing is playing. Which brings us to another interesting idea that I got. Each"
2044880,2052240," individual frequency is a value from 0 to 1. So, it's literally interpolator. We can incorporate that"
2052240,2059120," interpolator into the radius of the circle. What if the radius of the circle will depend on the"
2059120,2064800," value of the frequency? So, the more, the higher the amplitude of the frequency, the bigger the circle"
2064800,2071760," is going to be. So, when it becomes 0, the circle virtually non-existent. So, I think it's a rather"
2071760,2080400," interesting idea. So, let's give it a try. Let's give it a try. And it's super easy. So, because that"
2080400,2089200," interpolator is t. Right. So, it's right here. So, what we can do is just multiply it by t. And there you go."
2089200,2097120," Boom. That already looks interesting. Look how... Yeah."
2102160,2107520," So, that's so cool. We can do the same thing, actually, with the thickness."
2107520,2112000," We can just multiply it by t. Like so. Boom."
2112000,2117200," And yeah, maybe the thickness has to be like a little bit thicker."
2117200,2120800," Yeah. Because you want to be able to see this thing."
2120800,2129040," Yeah. So, there's so many things already going on. It's like really stimulating for your brain."
2130240,2138720," Right. But the problem here is that already somewhere here, the circles are actually too small."
2138720,2143600," Right. So, at some point, they become like very difficult to see."
2143600,2156640," Right. And one of the things we can do, we can incorporate the idea from animation easing."
2156640,2158160," Do you guys know what it is?"
2158160,2162400," Right. So, there was a website. There was actually a pretty cool website on the topic."
2162400,2165360," So, let me find that."
2165360,2166720," Animation easing."
2166720,2169520," I hope I spelled it correctly."
2169520,2174560," The complete guide for animation easing function."
2174560,2179920," So, essentially, when you're animating things,"
2179920,2185520," Right. When you're animating things, you can interpolate the value from A to B just linearly."
2185520,2187200," Just like a line."
2187200,2190320," But it doesn't look and it doesn't feel nice."
2190320,2194800," Because of that, the animators usually interpolate them by some sort of a function."
2194800,2196240," It could be like a sine wave."
2196240,2197760," It could be square."
2197760,2199120," It could be cube."
2199120,2203040," Sometimes it could be square root and stuff like that."
2203040,2208000," And on this website, you can actually get the feel of each individual function"
2208000,2210960," and see how it sort of feels when you animate with it."
2210960,2212400," I'm going to put it in the description as well."
2213600,2222160," And the cool thing about the values from 0 to 1, yet again, right, magical values that I absolutely love,"
2222160,2231040," is that if you, for example, square the value from 0 to 1, it stays as the value from 0 to 1."
2231040,2237920," And if you take a square root of a value from 0 to 1, it still stays a value from 0 to 1."
2237920,2242400," So, that makes applying all these functions super easier, right?"
2242400,2251680," So, if I want to do some sort of like an easing right in here for the radius, I can just, you know,"
2251680,2254080," take a square of t."
2254080,2257920," Like, I can multiply by t yet another time."
2257920,2259200," Right."
2259200,2264240," And the size of the circle is going to behave non-linearly."
2264240,2266000," It's going to behave like a square."
2266000,2272240," So, it's going to basically go from 0, but it's going to start ramping up very, very quickly."
2272240,2273280," Actually, no, no, no."
2273280,2278000," It's going to stall a little bit, and it's only going to become big closer to 1."
2278000,2278880," Right."
2278880,2280320," So, I think we should be able to see that."
2280320,2281600," So, I'm not quite sure."
2281600,2284720," So, let's recompile this into a stop."
2284720,2286000," Yeah."
2286000,2289520," So, you see, it actually did the opposite to what we do."
2289520,2291200," Right."
2291200,2295200," It started to make the big circle very later."
2295840,2298320," We want to make them bigger a little bit earlier."
2298320,2299840," Right."
2299840,2305200," And the way we can achieve that is by probably using sort of like an opposite function,"
2305200,2306720," which is the square root."
2306720,2307680," So, it becomes..."
2309760,2313840," It makes more sense if you kind of visualize them, if you can just draw them."
2313840,2315280," So, you have the axis."
2315280,2316240," All right."
2316240,2319760," And you have one in here and one in here."
2319760,2323760," So, this is sort of like the intersection."
2323760,2324800," And that's what it is."
2324800,2327200," So, here's how a linear function looks like."
2327200,2328160," It just goes like this."
2328160,2331840," Square looks like this."
2331840,2336560," And square root looks like this."
2336560,2341360," So, if instead of using the linear function, we use square,"
2341360,2342000," it's going to..."
2342000,2345600," The circle is going to stay very small for a long enough time"
2345600,2348240," until it ramps up very quickly and becomes full."
2348240,2352560," So, if we're going to use a square root,"
2352560,2355280," it's going to ramp up to be big as soon as possible."
2355280,2359200," And then, it's going to like stall being big until the full end."
2359200,2360880," And this is roughly what we want."
2360880,2361120," Right."
2361120,2363920," So, because the thing I don't like about this visualization is that"
2363920,2367280," they become big too late."
2367280,2368560," Right."
2368560,2371600," So, I want to see circles like around here."
2371600,2373360," We still can see them, but it's just like..."
2373360,2375040," Yeah."
2375040,2378160," They should become fuller a little bit earlier."
2378160,2380480," And here, it is kind of too late."
2381520,2383840," So, what we can do now..."
2383840,2386000," It should be ready straight forward."
2386000,2387200," It should be ready straight forward."
2387200,2389440," It's kind of a similar idea as in animation."
2389440,2392560," When you want to ease out some things."
2392560,2396080," So, let's just do a square root of this entire thing."
2396080,2396960," And boom."
2396960,2398880," And see..."
2398880,2400400," Yeah, that looks much better."
2400400,2401200," Look at that."
2401200,2402480," Look especially at this thing."
2402480,2403840," Yeah."
2403840,2405040," So, that's exactly what they want."
2405040,2405920," They're still..."
2405920,2414480," Their size still depends heavily on, you know, on the actual value."
2414480,2414720," Right."
2414720,2417200," So, but they become bigger much earlier."
2417200,2418800," Much earlier."
2418800,2420240," So, and it just like looks nice."
2420240,2422880," So, I really like that."
2422880,2424960," We can do the same thing with thickness, by the way."
2424960,2426080," Who said we cannot do that?"
2426640,2430960," Because quite often we have situations like this, when the thickness is just like too small."
2430960,2432400," All right."
2432400,2434480," So, it doesn't really look that nice."
2434480,2438480," So, let's go ahead and put square root here as well."
2438480,2440800," There we go."
2441280,2443120," So, that looks a little bit nicer now."
2443120,2446000," I'm not sure how it plays out with the..."
2446000,2448560," With the encoding and stuff like that."
2448560,2450240," But I hope it works nice."
2450240,2454240," So, we can make the radius..."
2454240,2456320," We can even multiply the radius maybe by half."
2456320,2459120," So, maybe that's what we want to have in here."
2459120,2460480," So, they're now even bigger."
2460480,2462640," So, yeah."
2462640,2463360," That's pretty cool."
2463360,2470240," So, another problem that I have in here is that there's no anti-aliasing, which kind of sucks."
2471280,2477680," There is a way to enable anti-aliasing for RayLip."
2477680,2480320," But that requires restarting the application."
2480320,2481680," Which is fine, I guess."
2481680,2484800," Which is totally fine."
2484800,2490400," So, in RayLip, there is a flag that enables multi-sampling anti-aliasing."
2490400,2490960," Right, there we go."
2490960,2494240," So, it's a flag msa a for x hint."
2494240,2499840," And you have to do that right before you initialize RayLip."
2500720,2502720," So, let me find this entire thing."
2502720,2506640," And where is the main usualizer?"
2506640,2510000," So, we have to put it somewhere here."
2510000,2514320," But I don't remember the function that we have to call in here."
2514320,2517280," So, I know that that accepts config flags."
2517280,2519920," So, let me quickly use Google."
2519920,2521600," Yeah, let's actually go ahead and use Google."
2521600,2524160," So, I'm going to do Google."
2524160,2527760," So, we know that this function accepts config flags."
2527760,2529600," It's probably not going to return anything."
2529600,2531200," So, is there a function like that?"
2531200,2531840," So, there is a..."
2531840,2534080," Oh, that's very interesting."
2534080,2543520," I swear to God, if this function actually accepts integer instead of config flag or something like that."
2543520,2544720," Raysan."
2545600,2546080," Why?"
2546080,2547360," Why would you do something like that?"
2547360,2549200," Like, I swear to God, if it is the case."
2549200,2551600," Just a second."
2551600,2553120," I need to add Google to path."
2555200,2556080," Is there something like..."
2556080,2559840," Okay, I'm going to try to do config."
2559840,2561840," Maybe there is something like config."
2561840,2572160," Maybe it's something like set config."
2572160,2574640," Yeah, it's set config flags."
2574640,2575040," Okay."
2575040,2575520," Like, why..."
2575520,2581040," You have the type for the config flags."
2581600,2584560," Why don't you use that type in the signature of the function?"
2584560,2585280," To indicate."
2585280,2587760," To sort of like for documentation purposes."
2587760,2589600," To document like where things go."
2589600,2590400," Like, why?"
2590400,2593760," What's the point of introducing that enumeration then?"
2593760,2595920," I'm disappointed."
2595920,2603200," Anyway, so what we have to do is something like this."
2603200,2605840," Let's go ahead and do that."
2605840,2610480," Let me recompile the entire stuff."
2610480,2613600," Let me recompile the entire stuff."
2613600,2617520," So, yeah."
2617520,2622320," Let's drag some music in here."
2622320,2625360," All right, that looks much nicer now."
2625360,2627120," We can take a look."
2627680,2635120," Yeah, so there is a really weird bug in RayLip when you enable like multi-sampling anti-aliasing."
2635120,2638640," Specifically, when you try to render the circles."
2638640,2638960," Right."
2638960,2644800," The edges of the circles, they look anti-aliased, though they feel a little bit like shift."
2644800,2646320," They don't feel really centered."
2646320,2647520," Right."
2647520,2651120," But at the same time, they have these random pixels in here."
2651120,2656400," And these pixels only appear when you enable multi-sampling anti-aliasing."
2656400,2656720," Right."
2656720,2658080," It's kind of weird."
2658080,2662080," So, I never looked into like what's exactly the problem in here."
2662080,2668960," But if I understand correctly how RayLip renders the circles, it actually interpolates the circles with"
2668960,2670560," triangles."
2670560,2670800," Right."
2670800,2674720," It literally tessellates the circle to the point where it looks like a circle."
2674720,2677360," And then renders the like a bunch of triangles in here."
2677360,2682080," And maybe when you enable like multi-sampling."
2682080,2682480," Right."
2682480,2685040," The math didn't assume."
2685040,2690400," The math that tessellates the circles didn't assume that there will be more samples in there."
2690400,2693520," And because of that there are some sort of gaps between the triangles."
2693520,2694960," But this is just a hypothesis."
2694960,2696080," I don't know for sure."
2696080,2699840," I don't know exactly what's going on inside of the RayLip."
2699840,2708160," But to be fair we don't really have to use the stock function to render circles in RayLip."
2708160,2712720," We can render them ourselves using shaders."
2712720,2713120," Right."
2713120,2718160," So, essentially we can, instead of rendering the circle, we can literally render a texture."
2718160,2724960," And then we can create a custom shader which basically checks whether a particular fragment"
2724960,2729120," that we're rendering is inside of a circle or outside of the circle."
2729120,2733440," And basically, renders that fragment or not renders that fragment."
2733440,2736720," And fragment in this particular case means like pixel."
2736720,2740800," So, it's super easy to render perfect circles inside of the shader."
2740800,2743440," And that's what we can try to do."
2743440,2744640," That's what we can try to do."
2744640,2745840," Right."
2745840,2751600," But I want to try to do that after a small break because I've been coding for 45 minutes."
2751600,2751920," Right."
2751920,2756080," So, I really need to make a small break, refill my tea and stuff like that."
2756080,2759840," And after the break, we're going to continue and we're going to create a custom shader"
2759840,2765280," that renders the circles perfectly without any RayLip artifacts and stuff like that."
2765280,2766640," And here is an interesting thing."
2766640,2772720," Once you have shaders, right, you can do pretty cool stuff."
2772720,2773040," Right."
2773040,2778480," We can even apply some sort of like a special effects in the shaders."
2778480,2778880," Right."
2778880,2781120," So, yeah, I think it's going to be interesting."
2781120,2782000," So, let's make a small break."
2782000,2783920," And after the break, we're going to do all that."
2783920,2785840," All right."
2785840,2787280," Let's make some shaders, shall we?"
2787280,2794720," So, first thing we need to do, we need to actually render rectangles instead of circles."
2794720,2795360," Right."
2795360,2802320," So, because we're going to be writing a GPU program that is executed on each individual,"
2802320,2806160," excuse me, on each individual pixel of that rectangle."
2806160,2810320," And that shader program is going to decide whether that pixel is going to be included"
2810320,2811840," in a circle or excluded."
2811840,2812080," Right."
2812080,2817760," So, essentially, this shader is going to carve out a circle out of the rectangle."
2817760,2818320," Right."
2818320,2823120," So, and because it's going to be executed on each individual pixel of the rectangle,"
2823120,2826400," it's going to always make the perfect circle."
2826400,2826640," Right."
2826640,2830800," So, it's not going to be interpolated with triangles and stuff like that."
2830800,2833920," So, it's just depending on the size, it's always going to compete perfectly."
2833920,2835520," Hopefully, that's the idea."
2835520,2838480," So, let's go ahead and do that."
2838480,2841040," So, I need to restart the game."
2841600,2842480," It's not really a game."
2842480,2843520," It's a visualizer."
2843520,2845360," But, I mean, we're using the library for games."
2845360,2847440," So, maybe you can say it's a game."
2847440,2850800," So, let's go ahead."
2850800,2851600," That looks nice."
2851600,2852560," I really like that."
2852560,2856160," That looks so much nicer compared to what we had at the beginning."
2856160,2861920," So, here is the circle."
2861920,2863120," Here is the circle."
2863120,2865280," So, the start position is sort of like a center."
2865280,2870640," Which means that we just need to subtract half of the radius."
2870640,2872240," Well, just radius."
2872240,2874560," And use width and height as the..."
2874560,2879920," Basically, and set width and height to double the radius."
2879920,2880320," Right."
2880320,2881600," So, this is the center."
2881600,2884640," We just move diagonally by the radius."
2884640,2887280," And width and height is just like a diameter."
2887280,2888880," Like double all the radius."
2888880,2890640," So, that's basically what it is."
2890640,2891600," So, I wonder..."
2891600,2894400," I know that there is a rectangle type in RayLib."
2894400,2900880," And can I just say, give me a function that accepts a rectangle."
2900880,2903680," But doesn't return anything."
2903680,2905520," Right."
2905520,2905840," And..."
2905840,2908080," One more time."
2908080,2914160," And also, it should accept a call, I suppose."
2914800,2915040," Right."
2915040,2917200," So, that's basically what I want in here."
2917200,2917440," Yeah."
2917440,2919120," DrawRectangleRect."
2919120,2919840," That's what it's called."
2919840,2921280," It accepts a rectangle."
2921280,2922720," And accepts the color."
2922720,2924320," And just like draws it like that."
2924320,2925600," Okay."
2925600,2926880," So, that's what we need."
2926880,2928640," That's what we need in here."
2929920,2933760," And we can now construct a rectangle."
2933760,2936160," So, this is going to be a REC."
2936160,2939520," And if I remember correctly, it accepts X and Y."
2939520,2944480," So, it's basically going to be start position X minus the radius."
2944480,2944720," Right."
2944720,2946160," So, this is the minus the radius."
2946160,2950000," Y is also Y minus the radius."
2950000,2952720," And width is double the radius."
2952720,2953760," Right."
2953760,2955200," Width is double the radius."
2955200,2958320," Please height."
2958320,2959280," Thank you very much."
2959280,2962720," So, let's try to compile the entire thing."
2962720,2964640," And see if it's going to do something."
2964640,2965040," There we go."
2965040,2967200," We have now squares."
2967200,2968160," They're not rectangles."
2968160,2971280," But squares are special keys of the rectangle."
2973840,2974400," All right."
2974400,2975200," So, that's pretty cool."
2975200,2979760," So, now we need to write a GPU program."
2979760,2986000," That is going to process each individual pixel of the rectangle of the square."
2986000,2989520," So, let's create a separate folder for shaders."
2989520,2989680," Right."
2989680,2991440," So, we already have folder for fonts."
2991440,2991680," Right."
2991680,2993040," So, we have some fonts in there."
2993040,2994160," Specifically, Allegrea."
2994160,2998400," And for the shaders, let's create circle."
2998400,3001040," And call it FS because it's a fragment shader."
3001040,3008400," I don't remember what kind of parameters like fragment shaders accept in Rayleap."
3008400,3010800," So, maybe we can go into the Rayleap thingy."
3010800,3013280," Into the Rayleap source code."
3013280,3014960," And take a look at some of the examples."
3014960,3017520," Do examples have shaders?"
3017520,3018080," There we go."
3018080,3019520," So, we have some shaders."
3019520,3022480," We have some shaders."
3022480,3025360," Do we have textures?"
3025360,3029760," Not really textures, but fragments."
3030240,3030480," Right."
3030480,3031280," Fragment shader."
3031280,3034640," Well, I mean, maybe we want to take a look at the textures, right?"
3034640,3037360," Because textures usually work with fragment shaders."
3037360,3038800," So, there we go."
3038800,3039840," So, we have something."
3039840,3041840," Cube spanning."
3041840,3042960," Yeah."
3042960,3044960," Right."
3044960,3046640," So, let me go to resources."
3046640,3047360," JLSL."
3047360,3049360," Shaders."
3049360,3050560," Oh, yeah."
3050560,3053920," And you may have different versions of the shader language."
3053920,3055760," So, you have to be careful with that."
3055760,3059600," But we're going to be using the OpenGL 3.3 shaders."
3059600,3063120," And there is a base of us."
3063120,3064560," Maybe that's what we want to have in here."
3064560,3064720," Yeah."
3064720,3065440," That's a good one."
3065440,3072000," So, here, the shader accept the fragment texture coordinates."
3072000,3072160," Okay."
3072160,3072800," That's nice."
3072800,3073600," And the color."
3073600,3079600," I suppose the color that should pass to this function, right?"
3079600,3081680," So, I suppose that's the color it accepts."
3081680,3084240," So, the output is the final color."
3084240,3086720," So, this particular shader also accepts some uniforms."
3086720,3088640," I don't think we need uniforms, right?"
3088640,3089920," So, I don't think we care about them."
3090480,3092960," And, yeah, we just set the final color."
3092960,3093280," Okay."
3093280,3094560," So, that looks nice."
3094560,3095920," So, I can just go to the circle."
3095920,3097440," And just copy paste this entire thing in here."
3097440,3099840," I don't care about that."
3099840,3101200," Add your custom variables in here."
3101200,3102240," Thank you very much."
3102240,3107280," And as the final color, let's set something like color red."
3107280,3108480," Right."
3108480,3109760," So, this is going to be color red."
3109760,3115200," And let's go ahead and load the shader."
3115200,3120160," This requires changing the schema of the state of the plugin, right?"
3120160,3124880," So, that means to add shaders in here, we'll have to restart the application."
3124880,3127520," We can't really hot reload that in the desktop."
3127520,3127760," Right."
3127760,3129280," So, let's go ahead and close it."
3129280,3130480," Right."
3130480,3131760," And let's do shader."
3131760,3134240," Let's call it circle."
3134240,3137840," And when we initialize the plugin."
3137840,3142160," So, as you can see here, we are loading the font."
3142160,3144720," And on top of loading the font, we need to load the shader."
3144720,3147040," So, it's going to be circle."
3147040,3148000," Load shader."
3148000,3151360," If I remember correctly, load shader."
3151360,3155360," So, first argument is the vertex shader."
3155360,3157040," And the second one is the fragment shader."
3157040,3158560," We don't really have a vertex shader."
3158560,3160480," We want to use the default one."
3160480,3163120," And as far as I know, this function just allows you to do null."
3163680,3164400," Right."
3164400,3168960," And the only thing you have to provide is the path to the fragment shader."
3168960,3172080," So, this is the circle and everything is fine in here."
3172080,3175840," So, I want to be able to hot reload the shaders as well."
3175840,3176560," Right."
3176560,3179040," I want to be able to hot reload the shaders as well."
3179040,3184240," And because of that, I think I need to update post reload hook."
3185120,3185840," Right."
3185840,3192160," So, essentially here, when the plugin has been reloaded, what I need to do, I need to unload and"
3192160,3193760," reload the shader again."
3193760,3194800," Right."
3194800,3197200," So, is there some function that unloads the shader?"
3197200,3197600," Unload."
3197600,3198720," Yeah, there we go."
3198720,3199840," So, that's literally what it is."
3200400,3203120," So, pre-post reload."
3203120,3203600," Right."
3203600,3204960," So, here we reload it."
3204960,3210080," So, we're going to accept the plug circle."
3210080,3212080," We just unloaded this entire thing."
3212080,3215120," And then we reload it again."
3215120,3218800," So, that way, as we reload the plugin, we also reload the shader."
3218800,3224000," And with the shader, we don't even have to recompile the application."
3224000,3224240," Right."
3224240,3227520," So, because the compilation of the shader happens at runtime."
3227520,3233520," So, just by reloading the plugin, the same plugin, we also reload a new version of the shader."
3233520,3233680," Okay."
3233680,3234400," That's actually nice."
3234400,3238960," So, alrighty, alrighty, alrighty."
3238960,3244400," So, let's go ahead and redo this entire stuff and see if I didn't introduce any compilation."
3244400,3247520," So, that is fine."
3247520,3250000," Let's start the visualizer, the mutualizer."
3250000,3252400," Okay."
3252400,3254320," So, how do we work with shaders?"
3254320,3255680," That's an interesting question."
3255680,3258320," I think there was like a begin shader."
3258320,3259120," Oh yeah, there we go."
3259120,3260240," Begin shader mode."
3260240,3262720," So, let's go ahead and do that."
3262720,3267760," Interestingly, interestingly, I don't really care"
3267760,3272800," applying the shader to the sticks, to the bars."
3272800,3276880," I only want to apply the shader to the rectangles."
3276880,3281360," Which means that I need to actually do this sort of like rendering separately."
3281360,3283600," So, first, I need to render the bars."
3283600,3287040," And second, I need to render the rectangles."
3287040,3290400," So, I need to split that process a little bit."
3290400,3292800," So, might as well..."
3293520,3296480," I'm going to copy paste the entire loop, I suppose."
3296480,3304800," So, here we can say we display the bars."
3304800,3306240," Right, so this is going to be the bars."
3306240,3311360," And I'm going to remove everything that is not related to the bars."
3311360,3312960," So, here is just the line."
3312960,3314560," So, I remove that."
3314560,3317040," Radius is not needed, only the thickness."
3318000,3318960," All right, makes sense."
3318960,3319920," Makes sense to me."
3319920,3323040," And here is display the circles."
3323040,3324880," So, two separate things."
3324880,3331920," So, and we're going to display the circles between begin shader mode plug circle."
3331920,3338080," And if I remember correctly, at the end, you have to say end shader mode."
3338080,3340080," Right, so you have to end that shader mode."
3340080,3345040," So, the lines are going to be rendered with default shaders."
3345040,3348960," But the rectangles, they're going to be rendered with a special custom shader."
3348960,3356080," So, and if we loaded the shader correctly, it should set the final color to red."
3356080,3359680," So, the red is going to be an indicator that everything is loaded correctly."
3359680,3361600," To be fair, that's not a good indicator."
3361600,3363920," Because red is usually associated with error."
3363920,3365280," Let's actually render green."
3365280,3367200," Let's render green instead."
3367200,3369600," And if we see the green, that means it's good."
3371520,3377680," All right, so in case of the circles, we don't really care about the end position."
3377680,3382000," We only care about the start position, which is effectively the center."
3382000,3383280," Right, so this is the center."
3383280,3385280," We don't have the thickness."
3385280,3386320," We don't draw the line."
3386320,3390080," And this is the center."
3390080,3391760," And we just like draw it like that."
3391760,3392240," So, there we go."
3392240,3394480," We successfully separated these two things."
3394480,3395040," I hope."
3395840,3396640," I hope so."
3396640,3397920," Okay, boom."
3397920,3400240," There we go."
3400240,3407760," So, that means now I should be able to simply change the color."
3407760,3409440," I can change it to blue, for instance."
3409440,3411920," And it automatically changes for all of them."
3411920,3415280," So, that's pretty cool."
3415280,3417840," Right, that's actually pretty epic."
3417840,3421840," So, and the color is actually computed on GPU."
3421840,3424560," Right, so this is the program that is executed on GPU."
3424560,3428000," So, if you ever wondered what is shader, right?"
3428000,3432320," Shader is a program that is executed on GPU as an opposite to CPU."
3432320,3433200," So, that's what we call it."
3433200,3441120," Right, so, and since you're running on GPU, you actually switch the paradigm of programming."
3441120,3448960," Usually, if you're working on a CPU, you're sort of like directly accessing the things, right?"
3448960,3450160," The parts of memory, right?"
3450160,3456000," So, the CPU approach is you have a program that just basically visits each individual memory,"
3456000,3459280," like sequentially, or maybe like in separate thread and stuff like that."
3459280,3469200," In case of the GPU, we're writing a program that processes only one single pixel."
3469200,3476160," It processes one single pixel and then we give it to GPU and it automatically executes that program"
3476160,3480400," for each individual pixel of the rectangle simultaneously."
3480400,3485120," Well, it's not really simultaneously, but it's, you can think of it as being executed"
3485120,3490640," simultaneously because all of the instances of this program, they cannot interact with each other."
3490640,3495920," Right, so, essentially, you can only write a program that processes one single pixel"
3495920,3498080," and that is basically it, right?"
3498080,3503280," And you need to somehow render a circle out of that, right?"
3503280,3505280," So, you need to somehow render a circle out of that."
3505280,3506240," And how do you do that?"
3506240,3508800," Well, you need to know the coordinates of the pixel."
3508800,3512480," So, the only thing you know, the only input you have is the coordinates of the pixel"
3512480,3515200," and maybe the color that you can pass us in here."
3515200,3522240," We can actually just actually forward that color like so."
3522240,3525440," And I suppose we, yeah, there we go."
3525440,3531680," So, we basically forward the color that we get from here, from CPU, right?"
3531680,3533280," So, back to being as it was."
3533280,3541360," So, since you only have the color that you got from the CPU and also the coordinates of the texture,"
3542160,3546400," what you can do, you can essentially, knowing the center of the circle that you're rendering,"
3546400,3551280," you can check is the current coordinate within the circle or outside of the circle."
3551280,3554560," If it's within the circle, you set the color to the color."
3554560,3557840," If it's outside, you set the color to transparent, right?"
3557840,3559360," So, you basically don't set anything."
3559360,3564400," And this is how you basically draw the circle with this like a different paradigm, right?"
3564400,3567600," So, you're not directly drawing the circle."
3568640,3572640," You basically check whether a particular pixel is within the circle or not."
3572640,3575200," And that's how the circle automatically is drawn out for you."
3575200,3576640," So, that's how it works essentially."
3576640,3578800," So, here we have a texture coordinates."
3578800,3581040," And I suppose it's a two-dimensional thing."
3581040,3582960," And texture coordinates, right?"
3582960,3589760," They are normalized in the sense that X is going to be from 0 to 1."
3589760,3590160," Right?"
3590160,3598640," So, let's actually do something like this."
3598640,3602160," I want to sort of like decompose them so it's a little bit easy for us to work with that."
3602160,3603040," Right?"
3603040,3605040," So, all of them are from 0 to 1."
3605040,3611200," And to check that this is true, let's actually set the color like so."
3612240,3616560," We're going to set red to X, green to Y."
3616560,3618000," And we're not going to set the blue."
3618000,3620080," And we're going to set the alpha to 1."
3620080,3622960," So, essentially, X coordinate is going to be responsible for red."
3622960,3624880," And Y coordinate is responsible for green."
3624880,3628560," So, and on the right top corner, we're going to have yellow."
3628560,3631840," So, it's going to result in this very interesting gradient of three colors."
3631840,3636480," Red, green, and yellow, which looks like a mango."
3636480,3639440," I usually call it UV mango, right?"
3639440,3645040," So, it's a usual test that the graphics programmers do to check whether their texture"
3645040,3646320," coordinates are correct or not."
3646320,3648160," They're drawing the UV mango."
3648160,3653120," So, if we manage to see UV mango, that means everything is correct."
3653120,3655120," And if we don't, that means something is incorrect."
3655120,3658800," Welp, something is incorrect."
3658800,3663440," I wonder if I can find like an example."
3664640,3669680," If I google UV mango, will I find something?"
3669680,3677120," Okay, UV shaders."
3677120,3679200," And let's do Google."
3679200,3684640," Simple mango UV quad is wrong."
3684640,3685760," Yeah."
3685760,3688800," Mango in quotation marks."
3688800,3692400," Yeah, this is how it's supposed to look like."
3693120,3695200," So, this is UV mango."
3695200,3701120," So, essentially, in the left top corner, left bottom corner, you have to have black."
3701120,3705680," Here, you have to have yellow, green, red, and green."
3705680,3708560," And we don't see that."
3708560,3713760," So, we're supposed to see a little mango in each individual square, but we don't."
3713760,3716000," So, something is wrong in here."
3716000,3718560," And I think I know what."
3718560,3729760," So, essentially, the fragment shaders in RayDeep work properly only if you use them for textures."
3729760,3731440," Right."
3731440,3735280," So, when you do them on shapes, then they don't really work properly."
3735280,3739200," I think it doesn't pass the texture coordinates correctly."
3739200,3745520," And to pass texture coordinates correctly, you literally need to pass a texture there."
3745520,3755120," So, we can create some sort of like a dummy texture and just like draw a square using like draw by drawing texture."
3755680,3758720," Which is kind of a dumb solution, but it's nothing unheard of."
3758720,3764400," In fact, in RayDeep, there is a default texture."
3764400,3766560," Yeah."
3766560,3769200," Default texture."
3769200,3769760," Wait."
3769760,3770800," Default."
3770800,3771120," Yeah."
3771120,3779040," So, essentially, one default texture to D is loaded, which is basically one by one white pixel."
3779040,3780160," Right."
3780160,3785520," So, and it is one by one white pixel precisely for this kind of situation."
3785520,3785760," Right."
3785760,3790560," So, when you just need to draw like a texture, but you don't care about the texture."
3790560,3790800," Right."
3790800,3795440," So, the whole texture is going to be computed in the shader itself."
3795440,3795680," Right."
3795680,3797200," So, you need some sort of a placeholder."
3798320,3804160," So, but if I remember correctly, it is not available that easily from like RayDeep."
3804160,3805840," You cannot have default texture."
3805840,3807200," Yeah."
3807200,3808080," You can't have that."
3808080,3810560," So, you literally have to like construct it from scratch."
3810560,3812560," So, oh boy."
3812560,3813120," RayDeep."
3813120,3814640," Okay."
3814640,3816160," So, let me find."
3816160,3819920," I'm going to try to grab default texture."
3819920,3825520," I think it's also texture default or something."
3825520,3827520," All right."
3827520,3829280," So, texture."
3829280,3836560," Oh, yeah."
3836560,3837280," Here it is."
3837280,3838240," So, yeah."
3838240,3840960," You can only get its OpenGL ID."
3840960,3844320," RL get texture ID default."
3844320,3849680," But what we actually need in here, what we actually need is texture to D."
3849680,3850800," Right."
3850800,3852240," So, we need the texture to D."
3852240,3856240," So, essentially, you have to construct this entire thing yourself."
3856240,3858560," So, we have to set the ID to the default texture."
3858560,3861120," Width and height to one."
3861120,3862880," And midmaps."
3862880,3865120," I don't really know what you have to set this to."
3865120,3868960," But we can try to search for how this particular function is used."
3868960,3869280," Right."
3869280,3871840," So, is it used anywhere within the source code already?"
3871840,3873680," Right."
3873680,3876000," So, oh yeah."
3876000,3876640," There you go."
3876640,3877280," So, look at that."
3877280,3878640," Just a second."
3879360,3881120," So, this is how you construct it."
3881120,3882800," So, yeah."
3882800,3885280," If you're not sure how to use a particular function."
3885280,3890000," Just grab for that function and see how it is used in the source code."
3890000,3890320," Right."
3890320,3894480," Because the usage of the function within the source code is the best documentation."
3894480,3895680," So, it's just like demonstrate you."
3895680,3897600," This is how you're supposed to use this function."
3897600,3900720," And that is supposed to give us the texture."
3900720,3901600," The default texture."
3901600,3904080," So, maybe it makes sense to save it."
3904080,3904640," Or maybe not."
3904640,3905440," I don't freaking know."
3906000,3909520," So, let's construct that texture on each and usual frame every time."
3909520,3910720," I don't think it's that big of a deal."
3910720,3913040," Plug.c."
3913040,3917280," And we're going to put that somewhere here."
3917280,3919040," So, this is the texture."
3919040,3920720," So, something like this."
3920720,3926320," And let's find some functions that render texture."
3926320,3929600," So, can we draw texture?"
3929600,3932240," Texture."
3932240,3934880," Yeah."
3935440,3937520," But we need to be able to scale the texture."
3937520,3938880," So, yeah."
3938880,3941440," So, we probably want to use draw texture xc."
3941440,3945600," And we can even pass the corner here."
3945600,3946720," That's actually pretty cool."
3946720,3948400," So, we're going to provide the texture."
3948400,3949200," So, position."
3949200,3951680," I suppose it's going to be."
3951680,3952800," Yeah."
3952800,3954640," Position has to be this one."
3954640,3959760," So, let me construct it real quick."
3959760,3961120," So, this is going to be position."
3962400,3966240," And it's simply center x minus radius."
3966240,3969440," So, this is going to be x."
3969440,3970560," This is going to be y."
3970560,3971280," And this is y."
3971280,3971680," There we go."
3971680,3973440," So, this is the position."
3973440,3975440," We are not planning to rotate anything."
3975440,3976160," In terms of scale."
3976160,3977360," This one is interesting."
3977360,3978880," So, since it's a one by one."
3979440,3981120," We actually need to scale."
3981120,3982240," Yeah."
3982240,3984560," We can just scale it by the size that we want."
3984560,3986640," And the size that we want is two radius."
3986640,3987520," Right."
3987520,3990160," And the color that we can pass in there is just going to be the color."
3990880,3992240," of the thing that we're trying to draw."
3992240,3995520," So, let me try to do that now."
3995520,3998400," So, that should probably work."
3998400,4000400," Yeah."
4000400,4002720," So, I forgot the semicolon."
4002720,4003200," Oh, yeah."
4003200,4009360," This thing is located somewhere within RL.jl."
4009360,4014800," So, RL.jl is basically a wrapper around several versions of OpenGL."
4014800,4018080," I think we can even read the description of what is RL.jl."
4018080,4024320," So, a multi-OpenGL abstraction layer with an immediate mode style API."
4024320,4024560," Right."
4024560,4030800," So, essentially, if you're feeling nostalgic about OpenGL 1.1 immediate API,"
4030800,4031920," you can just use this thing."
4031920,4035520," And it will work even on the latest versions of OpenGL."
4035520,4035680," Right."
4035680,4037760," So, just like a wrapper around this thing."
4040080,4043360," So, it's sort of like cross-platform API."
4043360,4045520," It works across several OpenGL APIs."
4045520,4050880," Which is freaking ironic because OpenGL is supposed to be the abstraction layer."
4050880,4055360," So, we're putting abstraction layer on top of abstraction layer."
4055360,4057920," Because we have too many abstraction layers."
4057920,4059600," Anyway."
4059600,4062320," Software development in 2023."
4062320,4063040," All right."
4063040,4065760," So, what do we have in here?"
4065760,4066640," Rotation."
4066640,4067840," And we're not going to get anything."
4067840,4069040," So, it's going to be zero."
4069040,4070320," So, we have unused rectangle."
4070320,4072080," I'm going to comment it out."
4072080,4074240," So, comment it out."
4074240,4075840," And bring this thing in here."
4075840,4077680," So, maybe we'll go back to this stuff."
4077680,4079040," Maybe not."
4079040,4079600," Probably not."
4079600,4082400," There we go."
4082400,4084640," So, now we can see a perfect mango."
4084640,4087200," So, yeah."
4087200,4090160," It actually passes the coordinates."
4090160,4094560," So, the black one is a left top."
4094560,4098560," But OpenGL coordinates imply that the black one has to be the bottom one."
4098560,4100720," So, it tries to sort of like..."
4100720,4102320," That's fine."
4102320,4103360," I think we can work with that."
4103360,4104480," So, that's totally fine."
4106160,4107680," So, let's go back to the circle."
4107680,4109520," Fs."
4109520,4111200," And what can we do?"
4111200,4111600," We can..."
4111600,4112640," Yeah."
4112640,4114800," We can do literally the thing that I said."
4114800,4118560," So, essentially, the square of x plus the square of y."
4119920,4123200," We probably want to find the distance from the center."
4123200,4125920," And since they are from 0 to 1, the center is half."
4125920,4131120," So, the distance from the center is going to be this."
4131120,4131360," Right?"
4131360,4133280," So, this is the distance from the center."
4133280,4138080," And then, we can check whether it's less or equal than the radius."
4138080,4140480," And in our case, the radius, let's say, is going to be half."
4141920,4142240," Right."
4142240,4144960," And if it is, we set the color of the manga."
4144960,4148400," Otherwise, we just set to 0."
4148400,4148640," Right."
4148640,4151520," So, let's actually set it to 0."
4151520,4152000," Like so."
4152000,4154320," Boom."
4154320,4157520," And that didn't freaking work."
4157520,4159120," Which is quite surprising."
4159120,4166320," That is the most bizarre I've ever seen in my entire life."
4166320,4167600," Why is it not working?"
4167600,4169760," Why is it not working?"
4170640,4176080," Because you have to compare this entire stuff to the square of the radius."
4176080,4178320," There we go."
4178320,4180160," So, that's very interesting."
4180160,4183360," It is circle now."
4183360,4188160," So, yeah."
4188160,4188960," That's how we do that."
4188960,4191440," But we can actually set the actual color in here."
4191440,4192880," Frag color."
4192880,4194240," Right."
4194240,4197920," And we will get back to the original thing that we had."
4197920,4199200," So, but it should actually..."
4200640,4202720," It's not even anti-aliased properly."
4202720,4203520," God fucking damn it."
4203520,4204240," Anyway."
4204240,4208560," So, but we can now try to anti-aliase it."
4208560,4209520," Right."
4209520,4212000," So, essentially, we can..."
4212000,4223440," We can know how much we are inside of the circle and how much we are outside of the circle."
4224000,4224560," Right."
4224560,4229440," So, essentially, we can compute the length."
4229440,4230720," I think it would be..."
4230720,4232800," Yeah."
4232800,4236160," It would be easier to actually use the vector operation."
4236160,4243520," So, one of the cool things you can do in GLSL is that you don't have to work on a level of separate sort of floats."
4243520,4243920," Right."
4243920,4246640," You can work on a level of whole vectors."
4246640,4251120," So, by just doing texture coordinate, you can say minus 0, 5."
4251120,4252400," Actually, you can do vector 2."
4252400,4253280," Right."
4253280,4256640," And that automatically computes sort of like the center."
4256640,4256960," Right."
4256960,4260400," We can save this thing to a separate variable."
4260400,4261120," For example, p."
4261120,4264080," And then we can do..."
4264080,4264480," All right."
4264480,4268560," Length p less than r."
4268560,4269440," And it's going to work."
4269440,4270080," Right."
4270080,4272000," So, it's almost like a Fortran."
4272000,4274320," It's almost like a Fortran where you have array operations."
4274320,4275840," Here you have vector operations."
4276720,4288240," So, interestingly, if we take the length of p, right, the length of this vector, and essentially subtract a radius."
4288240,4300640," So, if this thing is inside of the circle, that specific value, that specific value, maybe we can call it s, is going to be negative."
4300640,4303760," If it's outside of the circle, it's going to be positive."
4303760,4304880," Right."
4306160,4308400," So, essentially, we can quite easily check."
4308400,4312000," If s is less or equal than zero, that means it's inside."
4312000,4314320," If it's greater than zero, that means it's outside."
4314320,4330400," So, and essentially, the smaller this value is, the closer it is to the center."
4330400,4330880," Right."
4330880,4332400," The closer it is to the center."
4332400,4338880," In fact, we can even compute how much closer it is to the center."
4338880,4341280," So, let me actually try to recompile and just check that."
4341280,4341440," Yeah."
4341440,4342960," So, I didn't make any mistakes in here."
4344960,4352560," So, one of the things we can do, we can create some sort of like a glow effect."
4352560,4364800," So, essentially, if it is precisely inside of the circle, it's going to be, you know, solid color."
4364800,4370640," And then, we can create some sort of aura around this entire thing, right?"
4370640,4372400," Some sort of aura around this entire thing."
4372400,4377600," And make a gradient that goes towards the edges, right?"
4377600,4380000," And then, it will kind of create like a glow effect."
4380000,4384240," And I think it will make the whole look a little bit more interesting."
4384240,4389680," Like, imagine this thing not being just like circles, but also glowing a little bit with their corresponding colors."
4389680,4392080," I think that would be nice."
4392080,4393120," So, let's give it a try."
4394000,4401120," So, but we need to leave a little bit of a room for the glow, right?"
4401120,4406640," Because, for example, if I set the color of the background of this entire thing to red,"
4406640,4409200," we'll see something interesting."
4409200,4413040," We don't really have that much room for the glow, right?"
4413040,4415280," We don't have really that much room for the glow."
4415280,4420080," So, we need to make the circle smaller, I suppose."
4420080,4421840," We can make it like twice as small."
4423200,4425120," Right, so we can make it twice as small."
4425120,4426960," But now it is too small, right?"
4426960,4429840," So, we have some room for the glow, but now it is too small."
4429840,4436320," So, if we just go back to rendering nothing in the background, right?"
4436320,4439920," It's just like it's not the original look and feel that it was going for."
4439920,4443200," So, we can try to fix that on the level of the CPU."
4443200,4449600," So, we can just make the radius twice as bigger, right?"
4449600,4451280," So, in that case, it's probably going to be just three."
4452080,4453920," So, let's recompile this entire thing."
4453920,4455840," And, yeah, now it is bigger."
4455840,4462160," Now it is as the original thing, but we should be having more space for the glow."
4462160,4466160," Yeah, as you can see, there is much more space for the glow, which is super nice."
4466160,4466800," I really like that."
4468000,4472000," Okay, so, what we can do with that space, as you can see."
4472000,4477120," So, it should be here, essentially."
4477120,4486560," Essentially, we want to normalize that value."
4486560,4488080," We want to normalize that value."
4490880,4493840," What is the maximum possible value for s?"
4493840,4496320," What is the maximum possible value for s?"
4496320,4497680," We have to really think about that."
4497680,4503360," So, let's actually draw the entire stuff."
4506320,4507920," We have some sort of a circle in here."
4507920,4508960," Right."
4508960,4513440," And we know that on the edges in here, the s is going to be equal to zero."
4513440,4516080," And it's going to become positive outside of this thing."
4516080,4517600," And negative here, but it doesn't matter."
4517600,4519120," Right."
4519120,4524800," So, the maximum value, we should think, is basically half."
4524800,4525600," Right."
4525600,4529840," Which is sort of the maximum radius you can have."
4529840,4530080," Right."
4530080,4531120," So, this is half."
4531120,4532880," So, this entire thing."
4532880,4536480," Minus the radius of the circle."
4536480,4538000," Minus the radius of the circle."
4538000,4540160," And that's the maximum value this thing could be."
4540160,4546960," Though, we also need to cut out these sort of corners."
4546960,4547200," Right."
4547200,4549600," So, we need to cut out these sort of corners."
4549600,4551840," But they should be relatively easy to cut out."
4551840,4553920," We can have like an extra condition."
4553920,4555280," So, yeah."
4555280,4556880," Right."
4556880,4558640," We need to cut out these sort of corners."
4558640,4561520," And only then consider this to be maximum value of s."
4561520,4563680," And once we do that, we can do something like this."
4563680,4567360," And we get an interpolator, which we can use for creating a gradient."
4567360,4569520," So, that's basically the idea."
4569520,4570960," That's, I think that's a good idea."
4570960,4572240," Right."
4572240,4577440," So, let's first carve out the sort of like the edges."
4577440,4579280," I think that's quite important."
4579280,4584000," How can we do that?"
4584000,4585360," Is there an easy way to do that?"
4591360,4601520," Well, to be fair, it should be basically length p less or equal than half or five."
4601520,4604960," So, essentially, we have like an outer circle and then inner circle."
4604960,4606560," Right."
4606560,4607600," That's actually quite funny."
4607600,4608720," Right."
4608720,4611120," So, let's do it like that."
4611120,4613040," Maybe there is an easy way to do that."
4613040,4618960," But, I mean, we have quite a few branches, which may slow down the shader."
4618960,4621280," But we're not trying to be super performant right now."
4621280,4622800," Yeah, there we go."
4622800,4625440," So, we cut out the outer circle."
4625440,4632160," And within the inner circle, we can quite easily do, okay, this is half minus the radius."
4633120,4637920," And we divide s by that value because that's the maximum value."
4637920,4645680," And we have t, which we can straight up use for alpha because it's from 0 to 1."
4645680,4651360," Which now, since we use the color red, is going to be like a red, you know, gradient."
4651360,4652640," Yeah."
4652640,4652880," Okay."
4652880,4656080," This one is interesting because it's growing, right?"
4656080,4657840," So, we need to do the opposite."
4657840,4659120," That actually looks kind of cool."
4659120,4661040," This looks like a bubble."
4661040,4661680," Wait a second."
4663360,4666960," This is not the look I'm going for, but I think I'm going to take a note."
4666960,4670320," So, to create a bubble, you sort of, like, invert."
4670320,4670880," Okay."
4670880,4679280," So, and if you add additional, like, a white circle, you can create, like, a reflection."
4679280,4681120," It can be a reflective one."
4681120,4682000," That's a very cool one."
4682000,4684640," And if you make it white, for instance."
4684640,4690800," Looks like, I like how it looks like."
4691520,4692000," Okay."
4692000,4694000," So, let's make it red again."
4694000,4696800," And we need to invert this gradient."
4696800,4702080," So, I suppose we can just do minus one, which will effectively invert it."
4702080,4703360," And yeah, look at that."
4703360,4705920," So, it is gradient now."
4705920,4707040," It is a gradient now."
4707040,4714720," So, and now, what if we use the color of the fragment that we pass from the CPU?"
4714720,4716400," So, fragment color."
4716400,4717920," X, Y, Z."
4717920,4719440," And we're going to swizzle that a little bit."
4719440,4723600," They look fuzzy now."
4723600,4724080," Look at them."
4724080,4726800," They look like they're glowing."
4727600,4729600," They look more like they're fuzzy."
4729600,4734160," And the reason why they look like that, we can actually increase their size."
4734160,4736240," We can only increase their size from the CPU."
4736240,4739120," So, let's make something like four."
4739120,4740240," Yeah."
4742720,4747440," The reason why they look fuzzy is because the gradient is linear."
4747440,4749040," Yeah."
4749040,4754000," Linear interpolations, they rarely look good."
4754000,4755760," They rarely look natural."
4755760,4759360," Well, I mean, if what we want to create is fuzziness, maybe it's fine."
4759360,4761520," But for the glow, it actually..."
4761520,4764320," Let's try different interpolations."
4764320,4767280," We can do the same thing as we did with the sizes, with SQRT."
4767280,4770400," We can try to apply SQRT there as well and see how it's going to go."
4770400,4774880," So, we can just literally say XQRT, SQRT, T, and..."
4774880,4778320," Where is the compilation?"
4778320,4779840," And see if it's going to..."
4779840,4780480," Oh, okay."
4780480,4782160," So, it actually made it even more."
4782160,4782560," Yeah, yeah."
4782560,4786000," Because the square root, it's..."
4786000,4787840," Yeah, it ramps up very quickly."
4787840,4789440," So, it became even more solid."
4789440,4790560," We need the opposite thing."
4790560,4791600," Right."
4791600,4794640," So, it needs to decrease very quickly."
4794640,4797600," So, let's go ahead and try to do that."
4797600,4799040," So, we can take a square of that."
4799040,4801120," Is it going to look..."
4801120,4802800," All right."
4802800,4804160," That looks a little better."
4804160,4808480," You know what's interesting is that we can use not only square."
4808480,4811520," We can use a cube."
4812560,4815600," I don't have to rebuild because it's shade, but anyway."
4815600,4817280," Okay."
4817280,4818160," That's very interesting."
4818160,4822400," What if I made this thing smaller even?"
4822400,4824640," Okay."
4824640,4825280," So, that's cool."
4825280,4830960," Let's try to experiment with..."
4830960,4831200," Yeah."
4831200,4839120," The cool thing is that the more squares, like the more power you have, the more tight it becomes."
4839120,4840240," I think that's what it does."
4840240,4841360," Right."
4841360,4844720," So, it's too spread out."
4844720,4848240," If we want to make it a little bit tight, we just like increase the power."
4848240,4850080," Right."
4850080,4851280," And it becomes a little bit tight."
4851280,4854080," And it now looks more like it's glowing."
4854080,4857520," And we can make it even more tight by taking the cube."
4857520,4862960," And the more like powers we layer out, the more tight it becomes."
4862960,4869920," So, and the smaller the radius, the more spread out is going to be at the end."
4869920,4872640," So, we can try to do something like this."
4872640,4873600," So, it's very small."
4873600,4878640," But then we can increase its size by just increasing it on the CPU."
4878640,4880480," Increasing the hours thing in there."
4880480,4883120," So, we can just like increase the hour stuff."
4883120,4886080," Maybe even like 8."
4886080,4888960," Right."
4888960,4892960," So, I don't know."
4892960,4895840," Maybe we can make it a little bit bigger."
4898240,4898720," All right."
4898720,4903840," So, it doesn't really look like it's glowing."
4903840,4907040," In the sense that I think the center has to be brighter."
4907040,4914880," One of the things we can do, we can multiply the center by like a half or something."
4914880,4918880," That's not a bad idea, actually."
4918880,4921520," It's not a bad idea."
4924400,4925280," What if 25?"
4925280,4927280," But I think it's a little bit too bright."
4927280,4932720," So, yeah, it's kind of cool."
4932720,4936960," Now we can experiment with those things and just see how they go."
4936960,4940480," Oh, that looks nice."
4940480,4945840," That's so cool."
4951440,4960320," It's such a simple math, right?"
4960320,4963760," It's just like this interpolation and stuff like that."
4963760,4970000," And again, this idea of the normalized values from 0 to 1, they're like..."
4970000,4974640," This is the most sort of important idea of computing graphics."
4974640,4978080," And this is something that I even make a video on, right?"
4978080,4978560," Didn't I?"
4979120,4981840," I have a video, like the most important idea in computer graphics."
4981840,4985520," I think it was about olivettes, right?"
4985520,4988720," And yeah, so this is something that I discussed there."
4988720,4990480," Right."
4990480,4992880," It's so slow, but yeah."
4992880,4995440," YouTube."
4995440,4999760," Most important idea."
4999760,5001520," I think we should be able to find it."
5001520,5004240," Yeah, this one."
5004240,5006080," The most important idea in computer graphics."
5006080,5009200," And I talked about that there."
5009200,5015440," I think that idea of this interpolator from 0 to 1 is the most important idea in computer graphics."
5015440,5020320," Because it pops up literally every time I do any computer graphics."
5021840,5023040," Let me put it in here."
5023040,5030080," I think that's the most important idea in computer graphics."
5030080,5032400," All right."
5032400,5035920," So, this looks cool, you know?"
5035920,5041120," But this is not the only sort of idea I wanted to apply."
5042320,5044400," It looks visually interesting already, right?"
5044400,5047360," So, it creates sort of like an interesting mood, right?"
5047360,5049120," It feels like it's night."
5049120,5055680," Though, I feel like night is not particularly, you know, dark enough."
5055680,5058240," So, let me take a look at the clear background."
5058240,5060880," So, maybe we can try to make it a little bit more dark."
5060880,5062880," Right."
5062880,5067600," Yeah, okay."
5067600,5069200," So, that's a little bit there."
5069200,5074800," So, it's night and it's sort of like some, you know, fireflies are glowing and stuff like that."
5074800,5075440," It looks cool."
5075440,5077920," It creates a really interesting mood."
5077920,5080400," But it's not particularly dynamic enough, right?"
5080400,5082080," It's not particularly dynamic enough."
5082880,5089280," One of the idea I was playing with is basically for those sort of like fireflies to have some sort"
5089280,5090800," of a trail, right?"
5090800,5093520," Which indicates in which direction they're moving."
5093520,5098560," I think it is an interesting idea to try to implement, right?"
5098560,5100480," So, let me..."
5100480,5102480," Oh, that's actually cool."
5102480,5105440," It's kind of funny how they stop, right?"
5105440,5106160," So, because..."
5106160,5106400," Yeah."
5110880,5114240," Right, so they reach their final destination just like stopping there."
5114240,5114720," That's so cool."
5114720,5125120," Okay."
5125120,5126960," So, let me demonstrate you."
5126960,5135520," So, on top of just having these sort of like flowers, they have a certain velocity, right?"
5135520,5138400," They have certain velocity and they're moving in a particular direction."
5138960,5144960," What if, when this thing is moving in a particular direction, it is going to have like this additional"
5144960,5147520," trail, right, that looks like this."
5147520,5153920," And the faster it is moving in a particular direction, the longer the trail it has, right?"
5153920,5164400," So, this way they feel a little bit more like gooey and more sort of like, I don't know, like natural."
5164400,5165440," Not particularly natural."
5165440,5167200," I don't know what kind of word you can say."
5167200,5168560," Organic."
5168560,5169760," That's the word I'm looking for."
5169760,5171360," They look sort of like organic."
5171360,5173760," They're also glowing and they have this sort of trail."
5173760,5182640," And I think it will provide enough of interesting things on the screen to look at, to be stimulating."
5182640,5182960," Right?"
5182960,5188720," So, because with these kind of things, you want to be interesting and stimulating, but not overwhelming."
5188720,5189040," Right?"
5189040,5195680," So, I'm trying to come up with enough interesting things on the screen to sort of retain the attention,"
5195680,5196880," but not overwhelm."
5196880,5203440," And I think this last touch would be perfect for this kind of visualization, right?"
5203440,5205760," So, if they're standing, they don't really have any trail."
5205760,5212080," But then when they're quickly moving up or falling down, they should have some sort of a trail that"
5212080,5214400," indicates like where they're coming from and stuff like that."
5214400,5218800," So, the question is, how can we implement something like that?"
5218800,5220000," That's a very interesting question."
5220000,5226320," We can basically implement it in a sense of the particle system, right?"
5226320,5235920," On each frame, we can take a snapshot of this thing and always surrender a particle in that place"
5235920,5237760," and slowly fade it out."
5237760,5241040," That way, they will create kind of like a trail."
5241040,5247280," But the trail is going to consist of the shadows of itself, of snapshots, which I don't really particularly like."
5247280,5249600," I want it to be like a solid thing, right?"
5249600,5253840," Because usually these kind of trails end up being looking like this, right?"
5253840,5255360," They look like this."
5255360,5258720," And it's just like it doesn't look particularly good."
5258720,5262160," It looks for certain situations."
5262160,5263920," But what I'm going for is..."
5263920,5267120," I think animators have a term for that."
5267120,5269840," I'm going for smear frames."
5269840,5271280," Do you guys know what is a smear frame?"
5271280,5274080," This is already the second animation concept that I'm bringing up."
5274080,5276240," The first one is in functions, right?"
5276240,5278480," So, and the second one is a smear frames."
5278480,5282000," So, essentially, we're doing like a literal like animation in here."
5282000,5284320," So, smear frames."
5284320,5285680," That's what I'm going for."
5285680,5287280," I'm going for smear frames."
5287280,5290480," And it's sort of like an intermediate..."
5290480,5291440," Yeah."
5291440,5294880," These are the intermediate frames that look weird."
5294880,5299040," So, essentially, you have an object in position A and position B."
5299040,5306960," And you need to animate, not really animate, but convey a quick rapid motion from A and B within few frames."
5306960,5308080," Like one, two frames."
5308080,5316400," So, if you just like move objects as snapshots, it's not going to convey motion really well."
5316400,5319280," So, what the animators came up with is a smear frame."
5319280,5326720," They stretch and smear the object within few frames, creating an illusion of rapid motion from A and B."
5326720,5329040," And this is how they look like, right?"
5329040,5333360," So, sometimes if you pose some cartoons, they look weird like that."
5333920,5335120," And that's what they are."
5335120,5339920," So, these kind of things have a name, they're called smear frames."
5339920,5341520," And this is what I'm going for, right?"
5341520,5346000," So, I want to have smear frames rather than an actual trail."
5346000,5348800," So, that would have been perfect, I think."
5348800,5350480," That would have been perfect."
5350480,5357600," So, and I think it is super easy to create such smear frames."
5358560,5364800," Essentially, what we can do, we can take half of the circle, right?"
5364800,5368320," We can take half of the circle as a texture, right?"
5368320,5371360," And just stretch the hell out of it."
5371360,5376640," And that will create a smear frame for that specific circle."
5376640,5382880," And since we're rendering the circles already, we can use the same shader as we use for this specific circle."
5383600,5391920," Those, yeah, even the trail itself is going to have some sort of like a glow, right?"
5391920,5394240," So, I think that's a particularly good idea, right?"
5394240,5404400," But the question is, how do we determine how much we want to stretch this entire thing?"
5404400,5406560," That's another interesting question."
5406560,5409200," I have the following idea."
5410880,5422000," So, essentially, we can use this same trick as we used to smooth out the immediate snapshots of the frequencies, right?"
5422000,5426800," So, essentially, on each frame, we have immediate snapshots of the frequencies."
5426800,5430080," And we don't really display them."
5430080,5431840," We don't really display them."
5433360,5440800," We use them to compute velocities for the current frequencies that we're sort of keeping track of."
5440800,5446800," And we're updating it according to that velocity, like moving towards these frequencies, but not setting them to those frequencies."
5448560,5462720," So, if we create a third, second degree smoothing, we're going to basically have an additional point that follows the current frequency."
5462720,5472560," So, the frequency itself just follows the immediate frequency, but if we create additional thing that follows that following frequency, it will create an additional trail."
5472560,5476800," And that could be the indication where the smear ends."
5476800,5484400," So, it doesn't really make much sense, but let me try to code that and we'll see if it will start making sense."
5485840,5489120," All right, so, let me go there."
5489120,5492240," So, here's the plane, all that stuff."
5492240,5499920," So, let's create another thing, smear."
5499920,5500960," So, this is going to be n."
5500960,5503600," And where do we compute smoothing, right?"
5503600,5504720," So, here's the smoothness."
5504720,5515600," And essentially, smear is similar, except the target of smear is the smoothing, right?"
5515600,5518240," It is the smoothing, like so."
5518240,5521120," And we're going to multiply it by..."
5521120,5522400," That's actually two."
5522400,5525520," Let's make it slower, so we can actually see that."
5525520,5526880," So, let me try to recompile."
5526880,5529680," So, okay, we can clearly see everything."
5529680,5532640," And now, as we render the circles, right?"
5532640,5534880," As we render the circles, I also want to render this thing."
5534880,5537200," But I need to render them outside of the shader mode."
5537200,5544240," So, I suppose what I want to do in here is copy-paste this iteration one more time."
5544240,5545760," So, we're going to be drawing this smear."
5545760,5549280," To be fair, I don't particularly care about hue saturation values."
5549280,5552320," So, the color in this case is going to be just red, right?"
5552320,5553280," So, this is going to be red."
5553280,5554880," So, this is the center of this thing."
5554880,5558400," The radius is going to be stable, right?"
5558400,5559760," So, let's not make it too big."
5561200,5562160," So, yeah."
5562160,5564400," So, let's make it like equal to the cell width."
5564400,5566080," And the position..."
5566080,5573760," So, essentially, I just want to render the circle, right?"
5573760,5574640," So, that's what I want."
5574640,5577200," Draw circle."
5577200,5579840," I think it's circle v."
5579840,5581760," There we go."
5581760,5585920," So, this is going to be center, radius, and color."
5587040,5590400," So, that should be enough to see those trails."
5590400,5591680," Yeah."
5591680,5593040," There we go."
5593040,5599760," So, we can make their size a little bit smaller."
5599760,5604080," So, let's actually make them half of the cell widths because I think they're too big."
5604080,5605680," Right."
5605680,5609120," Maybe 75."
5609120,5610400," And I would like to maybe..."
5610400,5611680," Yeah."
5611680,5611920," Yeah."
5611920,5617440," As you can see, they basically say where the smear frame has to end."
5617440,5626480," So, if we basically render the line between the main glow thingy and the red one,"
5626480,5631280," it's going to be clear the actual smear frame is going to become like literally visible,"
5631280,5632640," essentially."
5632640,5636640," So, they're actually moving very slow, but we can control that."
5636640,5641680," We can control them in the same way as we control smoothness, right?"
5641680,5642800," So, here is the smoothness."
5642800,5645840," And here we can have this smearness."
5645840,5648400," And let's say it's going to be like five."
5648400,5650960," So, this is going to be smearness."
5652160,5656000," And so, they are now actually following a little bit faster, right?"
5656000,5658800," So, they're a little bit snappier, which is good."
5658800,5660960," Maybe too snappy."
5660960,5664080," All that is controllable effectively."
5664080,5664960," Yeah."
5664960,5667920," All that is very much controllable."
5667920,5674640," So, and essentially what it creates, it creates the end point for our smear frame, right?"
5674640,5682080," So, essentially that particular point, that particular red point tells us the end of that smear."
5682080,5684000," It tells us the end of that smear."
5684000,5688800," And knowing the end, so here is where it begins and here is where it ends."
5688800,5691600," We can just construct a rectangle"
5693200,5697600," and render this texture of a halfway circle, right?"
5697600,5702000," And depending on like where this point is located, we're going to just like render it differently."
5702000,5706240," But we'll have to swap the texture all the time, right?"
5706240,5708080," But that's not that big of a deal."
5708080,5711600," So, that's the simplest trick I could come up with, right?"
5711600,5715600," So, I spent some time actually figuring out how to do this kind of thing."
5715600,5717120," And that's the best thing I came up with."
5719440,5721840," I think it's kind of good, right?"
5721840,5725360," So, and yeah, feel free to use that trick whenever you need to."
5725360,5730160," Right, and smear frames are actually very powerful technique, let me tell you."
5730160,5733680," That's why the animators always use them all the time."
5733680,5741120," So, and by the way, smear frames is one of the reasons why like 64,"
5741120,5745040," 64, did 64?"
5745600,5752640," 60 FPS like AI interpolators for the videos don't work on cartoons really well, right?"
5752640,5758160," Because those smear frames were designed for a specific frame rate."
5758160,5761520," And then you're trying to upscale frame rate to 60 FPS."
5761520,5767840," And it, the AI also tries to upscale the smear frames and it turns usually into mess, right?"
5767840,5770800," It's kind of difficult to upscale smear frames."
5770800,5772800," So, which is kind of interesting, right?"
5772800,5776800," Because like FPS usually, in the animations,"
5776800,5782640," FPS usually not the limitations, but also it's a limitation."
5782640,5788320," But it's a limitation that is integrated into the animation intent, right?"
5788320,5792400," By changing the FPS, you actually have to animate it differently."
5792400,5794960," The intent of the animation becomes different."
5795760,5800640," So, this is one of the reasons why some of the new 3D cartoons actually are"
5800640,5802800," animated at lower frame rate."
5802800,5806800," Because with the lower frame rate, it's easier to create a specific intent."
5806800,5809360," If that makes any sense, I'm not sure if it does."
5809360,5815760," I'm not a professional animator, but I know about easing functions and smear frames, right?"
5815760,5818800," So, which maybe makes me kind of like an animator."
5818800,5821040," And also, you see animated things on the screen."
5821040,5825120," So, maybe… I don't know what I'm talking about."
5825120,5833600," So, anyway, let's try to see what we can do."
5833600,5838000," Let's try to connect the actual point, you know,"
5838000,5841680," the point of the end with the center of the glowing thingy."
5842560,5843680," Let's go ahead and do that."
5843680,5849520," So, we can call it B, which is basically begin, right?"
5849520,5851280," And this is TB."
5851280,5853360," So, this is the center of the begin."
5853360,5855440," We can call it like a start position."
5855440,5856880," So, this is a start position."
5856880,5860640," Maybe we can call it start."
5862720,5866960," And we need to have end, which is out smooth."
5866960,5868560," Let it go."
5868560,5874160," And let's replace start with end."
5874160,5877040," And we have start and end, believe it or not."
5877040,5881680," Now, we can do draw line."
5881680,5890240," Can we do draw line V, start position, end position, and the color."
5890240,5890640," Right."
5890640,5894000," So, I just want to be able to see those things, like these trails."
5894000,5897360," So, this is, I suppose, start position."
5897360,5899760," So, we use smear as the start."
5899760,5900080," Okay."
5900080,5900720," So, that's fine."
5900720,5902480," Okay."
5902480,5905840," We can clearly see them."
5905840,5906880," Just a second."
5906880,5908400," So, we'll pause."
5908400,5908640," Right."
5908640,5909680," So, this thing…"
5909680,5910080," Oh, yeah."
5910080,5912720," We're using the array leap way of rendering circles."
5912720,5914080," That's why there's some artifacts."
5914080,5916080," But it's just like for debugging purposes."
5916080,5918400," So, this thing is obviously going up."
5918400,5920960," And that's why this trail is like going down."
5920960,5921200," Right."
5921200,5923760," So, you can think of it as a string."
5923760,5924000," Right."
5924000,5926480," So, it's like a thing on the string."
5926480,5928240," And these things are swinging it."
5928240,5928400," Right."
5928400,5930320," They're sort of swinging it all the time."
5930320,5932480," I think something more dynamic would make sense."
5932480,5933440," Something like fly away."
5933440,5934560," Oh, yeah."
5934560,5935200," Look at that."
5935200,5936480," That looks so nice."
5936480,5937120," I really like that."
5945200,5945520," Okay."
5945520,5947040," That's pretty cool."
5947040,5951520," They're literally swinging them."
5951520,5952240," Look at them."
5952240,5953360," They're literally swinging them."
5953360,5955760," Right."
5955760,5958880," So, this is a perfect technique for creating this sort of like trails."
5958880,5960800," Okay."
5960800,5963360," So, what we want to do now."
5963360,5966640," We want to turn these two points into a rectangle."
5966640,5969120," Into which we can fit the texture."
5969760,5971600," So, let's go ahead and try to do that."
5971600,5979520," So, the problem with the rectangle is that they cannot have negative width and height."
5979520,5980800," Which makes it kind of difficult."
5980800,5984320," When, for example, and is bigger than the start."
5984320,5986480," Or smaller than the start."
5986480,5988880," It just depends on how we think about it."
5990720,5991920," So, it's a little bit of a pain in the ass."
5991920,6002160," So, let's try to construct this thing somehow."
6002160,6002960," We can..."
6002960,6006080," So, rectangle."
6006080,6008480," Rectangle."
6008480,6009840," This is going to be a rack."
6009840,6012320," And X is basically..."
6012320,6018400," So, let's construct it based on the start and end position."
6018400,6018720," Right."
6018720,6024320," So, start position is X minus some sort of a radius."
6024320,6027840," And we can basically use this as a radius."
6027840,6028080," Right."
6028080,6029360," So, this is the radius."
6029360,6032320," And then Y."
6032320,6035520," Y doesn't really have to be..."
6035520,6037120," Yeah."
6037120,6039040," Y can be just the usual Y."
6039040,6044720," The width is going to be the twice of the radius that we constructed."
6044720,6045600," It's not really a radius."
6045600,6048320," But I mean, I just called radius for whatever reason."
6048320,6051520," And we're going to assume the end point is bigger."
6051520,6055600," So, because of that, it's going to be Y minus start position Y."
6055600,6057040," And here is the rectangle."
6057040,6060160," And in here, what we want to do, we want to just like fill that rectangle."
6060160,6060480," Right."
6060480,6062800," So, it's going to be draw a rectangle."
6062800,6064560," I think it's a rack."
6064560,6065440," Right."
6065440,6067040," So, it's going to be a rack."
6067040,6068800," And we're going to use the coding here."
6069920,6070880," So, let me see."
6070880,6072960," So, it's not W."
6072960,6073760," It's width."
6073760,6074640," And this is height."
6074640,6076960," All right."
6076960,6078400," So, what do we have in here?"
6078400,6079360," And okay."
6079360,6080160," It kind of works."
6080160,6081600," But only when it's going down."
6081600,6082560," Look at that."
6082560,6083040," All right."
6083040,6084640," It works only when it's going down."
6084640,6087600," Because again, the width and height."
6087600,6087920," Yeah."
6087920,6088800," That's so fucking cool."
6088800,6089280," Look at that."
6089280,6092800," So, it's already like a trail."
6092800,6096960," You can just make it maybe a little bit bigger."
6096960,6097920," A little bit thicker."
6097920,6099440," All right."
6099440,6101360," So, let's make it a little bit thicker."
6101360,6104400," And you can make it the same color as the color."
6104400,6105440," Like the current color."
6105440,6107440," So, how do we compute the color?"
6107440,6108800," So, there is a hue."
6108800,6109120," Yeah."
6109120,6112000," So, there is the whole hue saturation value thing."
6112000,6115200," Though saturation and value everywhere is the same."
6115200,6119200," Which probably means that we want to make them kind of global."
6119200,6121680," Like the same for all of these things."
6122800,6124560," Saturation."
6124560,6126000," So, value."
6126000,6127920," Saturation."
6127920,6130560," So, it doesn't have to be like that."
6130560,6131920," Yeah."
6131920,6132960," So."
6132960,6136720," So, the color."
6136720,6138800," The definition."
6138800,6139600," Let's remove that."
6139600,6141920," Yeah."
6141920,6142960," It's kind of difficult to see them."
6142960,6145120," But when they're going down, they're the same color."
6145120,6146480," It's already like a trail."
6146480,6150320," So, you just need to draw like a correct texture onto it."
6150320,6151840," Basically."
6153200,6153840," Right."
6153840,6154560," So, that's nice."
6154560,6158160," So, this makes sense."
6158160,6160080," This makes sense."
6160080,6162160," Only if and is bigger."
6162160,6172320," Only if and is like and position y is bigger than start position y."
6172320,6176800," So, we can try to do it like that."
6176800,6178880," If and is bigger than start."
6178880,6181040," Only then do it like that."
6181040,6182880," All right."
6182880,6185120," So, because we need to do the swap."
6186720,6190240," I think I killed it."
6190240,6190720," Right."
6190720,6192800," So, it doesn't really work at all now."
6192800,6195040," So, and."
6195040,6197200," It's kind of weird."
6197200,6197920," Is that because."
6200400,6200880," You know what?"
6200880,6203120," I think this is what we have to do."
6203120,6207520," We have to do and position y bigger than start position y."
6207520,6209040," Maybe even equal."
6209040,6210240," Let's make it equal."
6210240,6213040," Yeah."
6213040,6214000," So, now it works."
6214000,6216480," So, and otherwise."
6216480,6217760," We just like."
6217760,6221680," We're going to be computing the rectangle slightly differently."
6223360,6225440," So, how are we going to be computing the rectangle?"
6225440,6225920," Otherwise."
6225920,6227920," So, x is going to be the same."
6227920,6229040," Y is going to be the same."
6229040,6230480," I suppose."
6230480,6237760," Maybe we're going to just use and position instead."
6237760,6240480," And this is going to be start and."
6240480,6242640," And position."
6242640,6244000," Something like this."
6244000,6248080," But it doesn't."
6248080,6249600," Oh, unused variable."
6249600,6253120," This is because we don't draw anything."
6254320,6254800," All right."
6254800,6256880," Okay."
6256880,6257680," So, that's fine."
6257680,6259360," So, now we have the trail."
6259360,6260720," Oh, look at that."
6260720,6263440," That is so freaking awesome, man."
6263440,6267520," It's already loose crew."
6267520,6268880," It's already a trail."
6268880,6270560," It's a little bit too, like, long."
6270560,6272080," We can maybe make it short."
6272080,6272880," Right."
6272880,6275120," So, we can increase the smearness."
6275120,6276880," Smearness."
6276880,6278160," All right."
6278160,6279360," So, it's a little bit tight."
6279360,6281040," So, it's going to end up in a shorter."
6283040,6284000," We can control that."
6284000,6285280," We can make it six, maybe."
6285280,6287760," Yeah."
6287760,6288400," Something like that."
6288400,6297360," So, and essentially, we just need to draw like a half of a circle into it."
6298960,6304240," But, we can only do the shader stuff on textures."
6304240,6307760," So, we can just, we can't just use this kind of thing."
6307760,6310160," Which is a little bit pain in the ass."
6310160,6315120," So, as far as I know, there is a special function in Relief for textures."
6315120,6316640," Draw texture."
6318160,6318720," That yeah."
6318720,6320240," I think it's a draw texture pro."
6320240,6323600," We can try to use that."
6323600,6325840," Draw texture pro."
6325840,6328240," But, it accepts too many different things."
6328240,6329280," It accepts the texture."
6329280,6331040," It accepts the source."
6331040,6336080," So, you can actually draw the substructure of the other texture and the destination."
6336080,6338640," And that's the destination that we want to actually supply."
6338640,6338880," Right."
6338880,6341200," So, this is what we want to be the destination."
6341200,6346320," And, to be fair, source, heaven source is not that bad of an idea."
6346320,6349440," It's needed for basically atlases."
6349440,6352800," When you have a single texture that contains several textures."
6352800,6357040," So, you can take a subtexture and render a single frame of animation or something like that."
6357040,6359280," And, this is something that we can use."
6359280,6362240," Because, we need to draw only half of a circle."
6362240,6369040," So, we can use that ability to just pick the correct smear frames."
6369040,6370160," So, that should be fine."
6370160,6377680," But, for now, I think I'm going to set the source to just from 0011."
6377680,6380080," Because, the default texture is one by one pixel."
6380960,6383200," So, the texture in here is just the texture."
6383200,6383840," The origin."
6383840,6388160," I think origin is basically just like how you're going to rotate it if you provide the rotation."
6388160,6390960," So, since we're not rotating, it doesn't really matter."
6390960,6392480," All right."
6392480,6394320," So, the origin is just like nothing."
6394320,6394720," Whatever."
6394720,6397360," I can't see choice in this mist."
6397360,6402480," So, in the tint is the color that we provide."
6402480,6402640," Right."
6402640,6404240," So, that's basically what we want."
6404240,6408400," So, origin is going to be the same probably for everyone."
6408400,6410240," The source though is going to be different."
6410240,6410480," Right."
6410480,6410480," Right."
6410480,6412800," Because, we're going to be flipping that thing."
6412800,6414640," Okay."
6414640,6414880," Go."
6414880,6416800," So, let's render the texture."
6416800,6420960," The use of undeclared destination."
6420960,6421280," Oh, yeah."
6421280,6422960," Because, I renamed only one thing."
6422960,6424320," I didn't rename the second thing."
6424320,6428800," So, yeah."
6428800,6430160," It seems to be working right."
6430160,6433120," So, we're just rendering default texture with different stuff."
6433120,6434400," Let me."
6434400,6435280," Yeah."
6435280,6436000," Let me double check."
6436000,6440800," Can I set the color to maybe green?"
6440800,6441520," Where's the color?"
6441520,6442400," I don't see the color."
6442400,6445520," So, just to confirm that everything is correct."
6445520,6448640," Yeah."
6448640,6448880," Okay."
6448880,6449760," Everything is correct."
6449760,6450400," That's for sure."
6450400,6452000," So, let's go back."
6456400,6457040," There we go."
6457040,6458240," So, that's pretty cool."
6458240,6466640," So, let's slap the shader on top of this entire thing."
6466640,6467040," All right."
6467040,6471520," So, if we just enable the shader for this stuff."
6471520,6476560," It should automatically create like a circle-ish trails."
6476560,6478160," I'm not sure how it's going to look like."
6478160,6479440," I think it's going to look awful, right?"
6479440,6480800," Because it's not half of the circle."
6480800,6482240," So, we're going to use the full circle."
6482240,6483760," Yeah."
6483760,6485680," And the circle is actually very small."
6485680,6488640," Yikes."
6488640,6491200," So, yeah."
6491200,6496240," We need to make the inner circle a little bit bigger."
6496240,6497600," You can kind of see it."
6497600,6498160," Just a second."
6498160,6498560," Maybe."
6498560,6498800," Yeah."
6498800,6499280," Yeah."
6499280,6500160," You can kind of see it."
6500160,6500800," So, here it is."
6500800,6501920," Here is the small trail."
6501920,6503760," But it just doesn't look good."
6503760,6510000," Because we intentionally set a small circle in here."
6510000,6513680," And the reason is because we make a very big texture."
6513680,6513920," All right."
6513920,6518640," So, we can demonstrate what I mean by setting it to red."
6518640,6520080," So, yeah."
6520080,6523440," It only makes sense when your entire texture is huge like that."
6523440,6524880," Only then it makes sense."
6524880,6527360," But the trail itself is not that huge."
6527360,6530960," That's why it's not applicable, unfortunately."
6530960,6539680," So, I feel like we need to create a separate shader specifically for the trail."
6539680,6544560," That's what I feel like because it's going to have different parameters."
6544560,6550640," We could have used the same shader if we knew how to pass these parameters."
6550640,6557120," So, we can't use uniforms because these are parameters per circle, right?"
6557120,6558800," So, they're not uniform."
6558800,6562400," Each individual circle, each individual bar is going to have its own parameters."
6562400,6564080," So, we can't use uniforms for that."
6564080,6565920," We need to have separate attributes."
6565920,6572080," And I could not be bothered figuring out how to do additional custom attributes in the Raylib."
6572080,6578560," So, Raylib is kind of cool at the beginning when you only started."
6578560,6583040," But when you go in deeper, deeper and more advanced, you kind of feel like it's limiting you."
6583040,6584480," Right?"
6584480,6585600," You want to have more control."
6585600,6589280," And this is probably why they have RLGL layers."
6589280,6593440," So, for you to have more control and maybe I need to dive into that."
6593440,6594960," But yeah."
6594960,6597760," So, I think I'm slowly growing out of Raylib."
6597760,6602800," So, at some point, I'll need to write my own engine on top of OpenGL."
6602800,6607040," So, I can have a full control and make my own renderers and stuff like that."
6607040,6610800," So, but I mean, for the beginning, it's kind of nice."
6610800,6613600," Okay."
6613600,6614960," So, yeah."
6614960,6621280," So, let's do a quick dirty hack by literally copy pasting this shader and call it SmearFS."
6621280,6621520," Right?"
6621520,6622960," So, this is going to be SmearFS."
6622960,6628240," And let's create Smear in here."
6628240,6632960," So, and we have to load it twice."
6632960,6639440," When we are initializing, right, when we're initializing and when we are reloading."
6639440,6643760," When we are reloading, we should not forget to unload the Smear."
6644480,6645760," And load it again."
6645760,6648160," So, something like this."
6648160,6651600," But that will require restarting the whole application, which I don't really mind."
6651600,6654560," Not that big of a deal."
6654560,6655600," Not that big of a deal."
6655600,6656400," All right."
6656400,6658160," So, let's restart this entire stuff."
6658160,6660880," And what do we get?"
6660880,6663840," So, let's start playing some new zack."
6663840,6666160," Where is pilot this on?"
6666160,6666960," Okay."
6670080,6672400," So, circle smear."
6672400,6676000," So, now we have a separate shader for the smear."
6676000,6680160," Which means that we can now control this entire stuff."
6680160,6680400," Right?"
6680400,6685600," For instance, we can make the circle itself way bigger."
6687520,6691680," So, which results in."
6691680,6695200," Well, I'm modifying the wrong shader."
6695200,6695760," God damn it."
6695760,6697760," I meant to modify smear."
6697760,6699920," So, there we go."
6699920,6703120," So, I can make that thing way bigger."
6704400,6704960," There we go."
6704960,6706720," Now we can at least see it."
6706720,6707120," All right."
6707120,6709520," So, now it's at least visible."
6709520,6712720," So, what if we make it like half?"
6712720,6714480," Oh, look at that."
6714480,6715440," That is so nice."
6717520,6717920," Okay."
6717920,6719360," Look at that beauty."
6719360,6720480," Look at that beauty."
6720480,6721520," That is beautiful."
6721520,6723760," Half is too much, I think."
6723760,6727440," Because we need to have some space for the glow."
6727440,6727680," Right?"
6727680,6728560," Don't we?"
6728560,6728800," Yeah."
6728800,6730560," We want to have some space for the glow."
6730560,6732480," Now, yeah."
6732480,6737520," But in this case, glow results in some sort of anti-aliasing, I suppose."
6737520,6738880," All right."
6738880,6740960," So, maybe three."
6740960,6745600," I mean, anti-aliasing is basically very narrow glow, isn't it?"
6746640,6748240," I think, basically, yeah."
6748240,6751680," So, but it doesn't really look exactly as I want it to look."
6751680,6754800," Because, right, it's not half."
6754800,6756160," It's a full circle, right?"
6756160,6757440," It's not particularly helpful."
6757440,6762320," So, and maybe we can make it a little bit more spread."
6762320,6764640," So, what if I just like make it linear in here?"
6764640,6769280," I can't see if it's good enough."
6769280,6771360," Yeah, I think that's fine."
6771360,6775440," For the trail, I think linear interpolation looks fine."
6776240,6777440," Yeah, I'm going to go over that."
6777440,6780960," But if needed, we can always change that."
6780960,6785760," So, now, can we modify the source?"
6785760,6790720," So, I suppose 00 is the left top one."
6790720,6792720," So, and if we go in..."
6792720,6793520," Ah, goddammit."
6793520,6800640," Essentially, what we have to do, we have to take like a half of this thing."
6801440,6802240," Did it work?"
6802240,6802240," Did it work?"
6802240,6806400," I think it worked when it goes up or maybe down."
6806400,6808240," I think it's when it's going..."
6808240,6810560," Yeah, when it's going down, it's actually pretty perfect."
6810560,6811760," I don't like this."
6813840,6815520," So, we need something like..."
6815520,6821280," There is a very good sample by Null that I absolutely love."
6821280,6822960," It's just an obstacle in my way."
6822960,6824560," It's probably one of my favorites."
6824560,6825520," Yeah."
6825520,6829200," When they're going up and down, it's just like..."
6829200,6830240," Yeah, it's just..."
6830240,6833120," Yeah, I think when they're going down, it's when..."
6833120,6836880," Okay, let me restart."
6836880,6839040," All right."
6839040,6842000," So, when they're going down, they're actually kind of perfect."
6842000,6842480," Look at that."
6842480,6843840," This is really good."
6843840,6846640," All right."
6846640,6849200," So, I think I nailed it for going down."
6849200,6854400," So, for going up, I need to grab the different part of the circle."
6854400,6855440," So, in that sense..."
6855440,6865760," If this is the top half, what I have to do is just this thing, but lower it down a little bit."
6865760,6869440," Okay."
6869440,6870720," I think I nailed it."
6870720,6874960," One more time."
6874960,6880400," Ah!"
6883200,6884160," Let's restart the one."
6884160,6888400," I want to capture the moment when there is up and down."
6888400,6888880," All right."
6888880,6889840," So, this is perfect."
6889840,6891600," We have up and we have down."
6891600,6892960," I think..."
6892960,6893600," Okay."
6893600,6895520," So, you can clearly see that they are too big."
6895520,6898240," They're too big."
6898240,6902720," So, we can try to maybe reduce them in here."
6902720,6902960," Right."
6902960,6904640," So, let's actually make 25."
6911840,6912960," I think this is perfect."
6912960,6932320," So, there's something weird going on here."
6939680,6941680," Let me try..."
6941680,6943120," I know what is going on."
6943120,6945120," The..."
6945120,6952160," These things don't scale according to the, you know, the height."
6952160,6956000," So, I think they have to scale according to the end."
6956000,6958480," How are we going to be scaling them?"
6959440,6959680," Uh..."
6959680,6962240," We can just, like, multiply by already sending here."
6962240,6964320," Yeah."
6981920,6986640," So, though, we're not using linear scaling, we're using a security app."
6986640,6996880," I'm sorry that I'm repeating the same sample over and over again, but it's important to capture."
6996880,6998320," All right."
6998320,6998800," Everything."
6998800,7002640," Yeah."
7002640,7003200," Sometimes..."
7004640,7005840," I think it's fine."
7005840,7009840," I think they have to be behind the circles."
7009840,7011280," Right."
7011280,7013040," To make sense, actually."
7013040,7016000," So, let me take the smears"
7016000,7020880," and put them behind this thing."
7020880,7022000," So, we want to render them"
7022000,7026480," before the circles."
7028080,7028640," like so."
7028640,7031920," So, it looks a little better."
7031920,7033120," One more time."
7033120,7038320," I think this is perfect."
7038320,7045600," Maybe, to be fair,"
7045600,7047120," this..."
7047120,7050960," making this stuff a little bit brighter is too much."
7050960,7054000," Do we make it a little bit brighter within this mirror as well?"
7054560,7055280," We kind of do."
7055280,7060720," So, let's not make it"
7060720,7062960," brighter anywhere."
7062960,7063760," So, maybe that's..."
7063760,7066640," That's the key."
7066640,7070400," Okay."
7070400,7070720," That's..."
7070720,7071360," That looks good."
7071360,7073680," I like it."
7073680,7077840," Uh..."
7084560,7092880," So, I think they're maybe moving too fast."
7092880,7094880," But, I mean, in case of the cheap tune,"
7094880,7097120," they always, like, close to each other."
7097120,7098320," So, it's kind of difficult to see"
7098320,7101040," the dynamic stuff."
7101040,7102320," So..."
7102320,7104960," Oh my god, this is perfect."
7104960,7107120," I really like that."
7107120,7109920," This is so good."
7109920,7110480," Holy shit."
7114560,7115840," Uh..."
7115840,7117200," All right."
7117200,7122640," Okay, let's restart it."
7122640,7126560," I just looked back at the recording,"
7126560,7127760," and when it's full screen,"
7127760,7128640," it looks horrible."
7128640,7130080," I really apologize for that."
7130080,7133600," Like, I was, like,"
7133600,7136080," looking at absolutely pixelated,"
7136080,7136960," you know, mess,"
7136960,7137840," and being like,"
7137840,7139840," ""Oh my god, it looks so beautiful!"""
7139840,7143280," That was the funniest shit ever, actually."
7143280,7143760," But, yeah."
7143760,7145600," So..."
7145600,7147840," But trust me, it looks very good"
7147840,7148960," in the full screen."
7148960,7149280," So..."
7149280,7150480," And one of the things we're gonna do"
7150480,7151920," in the future, actually,"
7151920,7152960," we're gonna do, like,"
7152960,7154960," a full high-resolution,"
7154960,7157680," high-FPS rendering via FMPAC."
7157680,7160240," So, then you can maybe, like,"
7160240,7162960," use it for a YouTube video or something."
7162960,7163440," I don't know."
7163440,7165040," Right."
7165040,7166720," But we're gonna do that already"
7166720,7169280," on the next recreation or programming session."
7169280,7171840," So, that's it for the day."
7172400,7174800," Thanks, everyone, who's watching right now."
7174800,7175920," I really appreciate that."
7175920,7176640," Have a good one,"
7176640,7178480," and I'll see you all on the next..."
7178480,7179760," Recreation and programming session"
7179760,7180880," with Azodin, of course, yeah."
7180880,7181920," Love you all."
7181920,7183920," Mwah."
