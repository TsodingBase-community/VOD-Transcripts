126480,128720," okay so the time has come"

136080,139760," uh okay go ahead hit me what would you suggest"
139760,141120," as a title"
141120,145440," it's full"
145440,154320," this is that"
157120,163200," uh no russian hacker plays with guns will mean that we will have a lot of russians who"
163200,166320," will try to speak russian with me and this is an english speaking stream"
166320,171600," gun makes popu that's all yeah people are not gonna click it"
177520,179840," something in c plus plus"
179840,181120," that's a pretty good title"
181120,183920," um all right"
183920,191440," what i learned over the years of streaming is that when you try to"
191440,197200," like make a funny title with the pen upon and stuff like that it usually doesn't work"
198160,203920," really when you're trying to be like a funny clown in your title like people just don't don't like"
203920,204160," that"
204160,211200," seriously it's it's really interesting it's almost like it's annoying to people so if when you use this"
211200,216880," kind of like title pew pew ah ha ha funny game haha join the people no people don't click on that"
216880,223520," um when you're trying to be like a little bit more serious uh what like when you explain"
223520,227680," something like i'm doing c plus plus development and c plus plus people oh"
228160,235440," i like c plus plus i'm gonna click on that uh yeah i need to write ahaha to indicate the joke i see"
235440,244880," uh so only serious develop percentage yeah maybe maybe these kind of jokes are just not funny that's"
244880,252880," why people don't click all right something in c plus plus okay so let's just uh have this title then"
256560,263280," handmade from scratch c programming well not bad that's a pretty click baiting for for the twitch"
263280,265840," niche for the twitch programming section niche that's that's true"
265840,278400," um all right so project update cmd project a game development in c plus plus and the source code"
278400,289440," source code it's gonna be https github.com something yes that's what we are developing today"
289440,295440," uh and uh yeah we still have two hours to uh for for our stream and this is exactly what we're gonna do"
299200,305120," so the you can find the source of the game uh source code of the game in the chat and let's take a look"
305120,317280," at it title is as serious as you can get sure um oh i forgot that i was downloading the elf linux64"
317280,325920," executable for risk 5. so the question now is uh wait a second can i run this on my machine"
326640,337920," can i run on this machine okay net uh okay file all right it's elf 64 lsb executable dynamically link"
337920,350960," uh-huh so let's actually move this thing maybe just copy uh-huh and let's make it executable and uh"
350960,352800," let's just try to run that shit"
352800,364400," fuck that go away disgusting you're gonna hit me with some sort of like a windows like installers"
364400,369120," get out of my machine all right all right"
369120,375360," disgusting holy shit this is the most disgusting thing i've ever seen in my life"
378080,383920," the only thing that is more disgusting than that is the qt official installation okay so"
383920,387760," uh all right"
387760,399120," wait what's file command uh in my opinion file command is not as interesting as the man command have you heard"
399120,406400," about man command i think it's a pretty interesting so we can take man command and put other command after"
406400,412720," man and it will explain you what that command does have you heard about that one it's actually a pretty"
412720,418160," cool command it's it's better than file command in my opinion um all right so this is the game that we're"
418160,425280," developing here uh yes it has guns water guns and also fire guns"
430560,436960," um have you heard about one can yes i heard actually uh do you have it uh can i install it by the way"
436960,446000," it's not available on debium"
446000,452880," but yeah i remember it it was actually sort of some sort of like improved man or something but uh yeah i think"
452880,460080," it's not available on demon uh all right so uh yeah we have a gun and you know there's a very interesting"
460080,468080," side effect to this gun uh that i discovered uh today actually um you can do shit like that"
473120,475600," which i wish i was thinking do i want to fix that uh"
475600,480880," and to be fair i don't want to fix that i think it could be like part of the game mechanics"
480880,488240," all right i really like that let's actually find the place where it would make sense like for"
488240,492800," example here because you can build in this game right so essentially you can just build some sort"
492800,498720," of like this thing and then you can like do some stuff like that and since this kind of things are"
498720,505520," destroyable right so other enemies can eventually destroy uh your barrack heads and stuff like that"
505520,513600," so yeah it gives it gives you like a temporarily uh temporary protection or something uh but yeah"
513600,516880," i think i don't want to fix that i think it's pretty cool in my opinion"
516880,524640," look at fun multiplayer game uh either death match or capture the flag or something yeah probably i don't"
524640,531760," know if i can pull that off i think the scope of the game is already huge enough i don't want to uh extend"
531760,532480," it even further"
532480,544800," okay"
547840,555440," maybe i should try to find my old kettle and still make a cup of tea because i really want to make"
555440,563680," a cup of tea i chat i'm addicted okay i'm addicted that's what i need tea"
563680,569760," all right so we need to think what we need to develop today we're probably going to continue"
569760,576320," working on the gun because the gun is not finished yet right the gun is not finished we'll have to"
577040,579280," make more stuff related to the gun"
579280,589360," but yeah make it a bottle real with skins creates additional characters that you can buy like ninja"
589360,595840," yes that's exactly what i'm doing um you can call brew tea just put the leaves in water in the"
595840,597120," refrigerator overnight"
602880,607760," seriously is that the advice you're giving me right now i want a tea right now"
607760,610880," seriously"
610880,619680," can we get steam achievements sure"
624800,634480," okay okay so let me actually just wait 12 hours for you tea ah yes that's such a cool advice thank you so much"
634480,641840," just wait 12 hours it's that simple"
646720,652000," ah ah what the has happened oh by the way i found a pretty cool bug with collision"
652000,660000," did you see that let me show you"
660000,668400," oh you can't see that but essentially uh you go to the corner and you hold left"
674080,682640," vector magnitude too large oh just like your mom yes okay so um i'm gonna quickly go and try to boil up"
682640,693440," more water uh using a different kettle so yeah have fun i suppose because i need tea i cannot continue"
694240,706800," without tea uh without tea"
706800,706800," i cannot continue without"
706800,708800," i cannot continue without"
708800,710800," i cannot continue without"
710800,710800," i cannot continue without"
710800,740780," All right."
740800,759180," Okay, so I brought my old kettle."
759180,761040," I brought my old kettle."
761040,764780," But the problem with the old kettle is that it leaks a little bit."
765240,771540," I'm kind of afraid of using it, but that's the sacrifice I have to make to have a cup of tea."
771540,774540," If you run out of soap, you can make your own soap."
774540,777100," Just mix oil and wait for a second."
777100,779780," Thank you, Bojanul."
779780,781360," This is a very useful advice."
783260,788580," Not safe, yeah, but use the samovar."
788580,792000," It's even more unsafe."
792000,793240," Right."
793240,796540," Using samovar inside is even more unsafe."
798920,799680," All right."
799680,803320," So, let's take a look at some of the issues that we may have here."
803320,808740," By the way, what's up, Saramun?"
808740,810060," Welcome to the streams."
810060,816000," Gun does not have a recoil animation."
816000,816820," Yes."
816820,817740," Yes."
817940,823660," Imagine if when you shoot, this gun would do a fail, fail, fail."
823660,824280," No, no, no."
824280,824700," Like this."
824700,825300," You can see that."
825300,826940," Like a fail, fail."
826940,828900," We need to implement that."
828900,830860," We fucking need to implement that."
830860,832740," That would be actually so fucking awesome."
832740,835700," This game would sell like crazy."
835700,837020," Yes."
838940,851700," The electric kettle is technically a samovar."
851700,854080," I'm surprised Russians don't call it that way."
854080,856600," Yeah."
856600,859400," I don't know why."
859400,863080," But we had electric samovars, though."
868920,873640," To be fair, I think the reason why we don't call it a samovar"
873640,877680," is because in our head, samovar has a very distinct shape."
877680,878580," Right."
878580,882280," And usually, I think, if it doesn't have that distinct shape,"
882280,884220," we do not consider that a samovar."
884220,886420," That's probably the reason."
886420,890520," Does it make sense?"
890520,892120," I think that's the reason."
892120,895940," At least, this is how it works in my head."
895940,898720," And I would assume that it works similarly in other Russians' heads."
898920,903440," electric kettles lack the bling."
903440,905300," Bling? What is bling?"
905300,906380," But it's interior too warm."
906380,907000," Hello, welcome."
907000,907680," How are you doing?"
907680,911800," I'm not familiar with this word."
911800,914680," I think my samovar is already down."
922680,937720," I got myself some hot water, and I also unplugged it just in case."
937720,938780," All right."
938780,951620," I got myself some hot water, and I also unplugged it just in case."
951620,955980," All right."
955980,959540," Samovar literally means self-boiling."
959660,960160," Yeah, I know."
960160,967040," Which means you don't need to put it in water, stove, fire to get yourself some boiling water."
967040,967600," Yes, I know."
967600,971200," But, I mean, this is not how words work."
971200,978300," After showing to just bling is a flashy jewelry worn especially as an indi..."
978300,979480," Okay, I see what you mean."
979480,981220," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
981220,983100," That's a good point, actually, it's an indi..."
983100,985740," I think for a Russian brain,"
985740,990700," a samovar, one of the distinct features of the samovar is the bling."
990700,992160," Yes."
992160,993720," And if it doesn't have that,"
993720,996980," yes, you actually described it better than me."
996980,997300," Thank you."
997300,997800," Thank you so much."
997860,998920," I see what you mean."
998920,1002460," Yeah."
1002460,1004880," So, for a Russian,"
1004880,1008660," samovar is not only a very functional thing,"
1008660,1010820," it's also an aesthetical thing."
1010820,1013400," So, samovar is a combination,"
1013400,1015620," is an intersection of these two."
1015620,1018320," And kettle is not an intersection of these two."
1018320,1020460," It lacks the aesthetical part."
1020460,1021860," So, that's why it's not a samovar."
1021860,1027320," It was a distinct feature for my five years old, mine as well."
1027380,1030480," Yeah, it's literally how it is for me as well."
1030480,1033400," That's why I don't call kettle a samovar,"
1033400,1036440," because samovar is not only a practical thing,"
1036440,1038040," it's also an aesthetical thing."
1038040,1039660," So, yeah."
1039660,1051040," Anyways, so..."
1051040,1053400," To recoil animations."
1053400,1054820," Why did I close my Emacs?"
1054820,1056600," I should have not closed my Emacs."
1056900,1058440," Never close your Emacs."
1058440,1060040," Unless you program an Ada."
1060040,1062320," In that case, close your Emacs"
1062320,1064380," and burn down Ada mode."
1064380,1065720," Don't use Ada mode."
1065720,1067120," It's a horrible, horrible mode."
1067120,1068600," Anyways."
1068600,1070660," So, let's continue."
1070660,1074640," Did I create the server branch for this thing?"
1074640,1075420," Uh-huh."
1075420,1076980," So, I need to fetch the latest changes."
1076980,1078820," I didn't even fetch the latest stuff."
1078820,1080080," How could I?"
1082080,1085840," You probably adopted the samovar."
1085840,1087020," I was molded by it."
1087020,1087420," Yes."
1087420,1090360," I also had a samovar when I was a kid."
1090360,1091900," Like, my family had a samovar."
1098040,1098460," So..."
1098460,1102420," Kiss my shiny metal son."
1104080,1105760," Uh, the thing about kettles."
1105760,1106640," Like, moldering kettles."
1106640,1110620," Is that they automatically switch off when the water is boiling."
1110620,1114300," So, we had an electric samovar that didn't do that."
1114300,1114780," Right?"
1115440,1117540," So, and essentially..."
1117540,1119240," Uh..."
1119240,1120600," It didn't even have a switch."
1120600,1121400," I remember that."
1121400,1124920," The only way you turn on that samovar..."
1124920,1126560," You plug it in..."
1126560,1127740," And it turned on."
1127740,1128940," You want to turn it off."
1128940,1130040," You unplug it."
1130040,1133160," So, essentially, if you want to boil some water."
1133160,1133980," You plug it in."
1133980,1136000," You wait until water starts boiling."
1136000,1136820," And you unplug."
1136820,1140260," Yes."
1140260,1141740," I do remember that."
1141740,1142280," Holy shit."
1142280,1142920," I'm so old."
1142920,1145020," I'm pretty sure that is not a thing anymore."
1145200,1146420," Um..."
1146420,1147140," But, yeah."
1147140,1150220," It's about how, uh..."
1150220,1152380," If you do that Emacs mode for Ada is..."
1152380,1155300," Comes with a huge code intelligence thing that you have to compile."
1155300,1155940," Yes."
1155940,1158420," And it doesn't really work that well."
1158420,1159080," I don't know."
1159080,1160220," And..."
1160220,1163760," Vim, for some reason, doesn't need this kind of stuff."
1163760,1164100," Right?"
1164100,1165280," It just doesn't need it."
1165280,1166960," Um..."
1166960,1169940," Maybe Emacs Ada mode has more features."
1169940,1170560," But..."
1170560,1172180," I don't really need those features."
1172180,1172900," That's the thing."
1172900,1174960," Like, I just need, like, a simple indentation."
1174960,1177360," And simple highlighting."
1177360,1179080," Like, I don't need any of this shit."
1179080,1183720," There's no way to just get a stupid mod where it just highlights the code and it has..."
1183720,1184040," Yeah."
1184040,1186260," Well, it is possible because Vim did that."
1186260,1187180," And..."
1187180,1187780," I don't understand."
1187780,1191940," I don't understand."
1191940,1192980," Uh..."
1192980,1195080," I think it's overcomplicated and not newsable."
1195080,1195720," Zhiyang!"
1195720,1197000," What's up?"
1197760,1199720," You missed Ada programming, by the way."
1199720,1202680," We were programming in Ada, like, first two hours of the stream."
1202680,1206320," And now we're programming in C++ and now we're programming in C++ and it was so fun."
1206320,1207320," Uh..."
1207320,1213440," We implemented from scratch the Ada Game of Life thingy."
1214440,1215820," So, yeah."
1215820,1217620," So, this one."
1217620,1220580," But the VOD is going to be available on YouTube."
1220580,1221960," So, if you're interested in Ada."
1221960,1223520," I'm not sure how much you're interested in Ada."
1223520,1225760," Yeah."
1226400,1228040," But, I mean, Ada is kind of close."
1228040,1228800," Like, it's..."
1228800,1232940," It's trying to compete in the same niche as C and C++ and RAS."
1232940,1233980," So, maybe it's interesting."
1233980,1236380," Uh..."
1236380,1243300," Depends on your definition."
1243300,1245040," That's a very good answer."
1245040,1249000," Um..."
1249000,1249520," All right."
1249520,1251540," Okay."
1251540,1254260," Uh..."
1254260,1254820," All right."
1255640,1258000," Welcome, everyone, to game development."
1258000,1259660," So, what we're doing right now..."
1259660,1260980," We're doing right now..."
1260980,1262080," Uh..."
1262080,1266600," We are implementing the recoil animation for the gun."
1266600,1269360," Recoil animation for the gun."
1269360,1271500," Uh..."
1271500,1272460," Let's quickly do that."
1272460,1274300," World WTF."
1274300,1275540," That gun is massive."
1275540,1277620," Well, I mean, it's a..."
1277620,1278020," Yeah."
1278020,1279720," That's how it's supposed to work."
1279720,1280580," It's by design."
1280580,1284500," So, we can clearly see the direction to which you're shooting."
1284840,1288480," There's also another pretty cool aspect of the game now."
1288480,1292860," So, essentially, you can build, you know, barricades and stuff like that."
1292860,1295200," And you can shoot out of them."
1295200,1297000," Right."
1297000,1297900," You can shoot like that."
1297900,1300980," But if you go too further, you can shoot like this."
1301360,1310200," It's a feature, not a bug."
1310200,1310500," Yes."
1310500,1312960," So, I was actually thinking, uh..."
1312960,1313680," Like, off-screen."
1313680,1314860," Do I want to fix that?"
1314860,1316440," Do I want to somehow fix that?"
1316440,1318880," And I came to the conclusion, no, I don't want to fix that."
1318880,1319820," This is a feature."
1319820,1321720," Yeah."
1321720,1323020," Uh..."
1323020,1324400," So, that's pretty cool."
1324600,1326540," But if you have some sort of an enemy..."
1326540,1326860," Right."
1326860,1329600," I don't think it's going to work for an enemy because..."
1329600,1331240," Uh..."
1331240,1333240," Well, I mean..."
1333240,1336500," That's a..."
1336500,1337660," That's a separate bug."
1337660,1338000," Okay."
1338000,1340240," So, uh..."
1340240,1341440," Oh, shit."
1341440,1341840," Fuck."
1341840,1342340," Oh, shit."
1342400,1342840," Oh, fuck."
1342840,1345000," Oh, fuck."
1345000,1349700," Cool."
1349700,1353580," Um..."
1353580,1356480," Should the gun actually be able to shoot through the wall like that?"
1356480,1356840," Uh..."
1356840,1358180," We just discussed that, didn't we?"
1358180,1358880," Yes."
1358880,1359380," It should."
1359380,1360300," That's intentional."
1360300,1362400," Uh..."
1362400,1362760," All right."
1362760,1365860," So, let me create a separate branch."
1365860,1367380," It's going to be, uh..."
1367380,1368700," Three, five, six."
1368700,1369880," Three, five, six."
1370880,1373180," What GCC version are you using?"
1373180,1376320," I get compiler errors with GCC 10, too."
1376320,1376800," Uh..."
1376800,1378260," I'm using an old one."
1378260,1379920," This one."
1379920,1381340," Have you tried Clang, by the way?"
1381340,1385980," Make little ropes."
1385980,1388160," Grapple hoops to allow the more mobility."
1388160,1389180," Maybe right clean."
1389180,1392860," I see what you're trying to do here, Wings in the Sky."
1392860,1393400," Yes."
1393400,1395200," We're not going to add them."
1395200,1399860," Uh..."
1399860,1401400," All right."
1401400,1407280," So, gun, uh, weapon, actually."
1407280,1418260," So, I suppose the state, the recoil state should be actually located somewhere here."
1418260,1420020," Right."
1420020,1424140," So, here's the gun and, yeah, so here's the skin scale."
1425020,1430760," Did you have a lot of hair last month or am I losing my mind?"
1430760,1432120," No, I never had a lot of hair."
1432120,1433520," I was actually born like that."
1433520,1434760," It just doesn't grow."
1434760,1435440," Sorry."
1439500,1440120," All right."
1440120,1441900," So, let's have some sort of animation."
1441900,1445240," So, the easiest way to implement a recoil animation would be..."
1445240,1454920," Well, I mean, technically, it's correct."
1454920,1455320," Well, I mean, technically, it's correct."
1456700,1460440," Uh, tablet time, yes."
1460440,1465500," So, here is, uh, this thing."
1465500,1470800," And here's the beginning of the gun, right?"
1470800,1471600," So, here's the beginning."
1471600,1473060," This is a sprite of the gun, right?"
1473120,1473860," But this is the beginning."
1473860,1477900," Essentially, we're going to have a variable that indicates the offset."
1477900,1483260," And when you shoot, that variable will instantly offset it to here."
1483260,1491800," And if the variable is offset, uh, we're going to slowly bring it back to its original position."
1491800,1497940," So, to do a recoil, you just need to set that variable to 1, which will indicate full offset."
1498160,1501780," And we're going to have a code that looks, okay, is this variable greater than 0?"
1501780,1502460," Okay."
1502460,1505480," That means we're going to reduce it and we're going to use that variable during the rendering."
1505480,1509000," That way, uh, the recoil will look like this."
1509000,1514100," Uh, like, it instantly jumps to back and then slowly goes, uh, further."
1514100,1518160," Like, you see what I mean?"
1518160,1520940," Don't, don't clip that out of the context."
1520940,1527020," So, uh, oh, man, I'm sorry."
1527020,1529220," Anyway, I have a friend who can't grow a beard."
1529220,1530320," Is that me?"
1530320,1531540," I also cannot grow a beard."
1531540,1542560," Anyway, if you just believe, holy shit, this is the worst advice you can give."
1542560,1547300," Like, if you just believe."
1547300,1552360," Imagine you're genetically incapable of doing something and then saying something."
1552360,1554760," Listen, you can do that just because you believe."
1554760,1563660," That's very sad."
1563660,1564700," Anyway."
1564700,1567560," Yeah."
1569460,1579080," You can do anything if you put your mind to it."
1579080,1583000," Well, that's a different sentence already and probably means a different thing."
1584920,1591980," I don't think to do a lot of things it's enough to just believe."
1591980,1597080," I feel like you also need to do something on top of just believing."
1597080,1602000," And think just believing by itself doesn't really work that well."
1602000,1608100," What are you, homeless?"
1608100,1609520," Just believe yourself a house, bro."
1609520,1610080," Yeah, exactly."
1610280,1613840," So just believe is not going to get you really far."
1629840,1643960," How are we going to call this variable, by the way?"
1643960,1645480," How are we going to call this variable?"
1645480,1664940," Is it going to be A or is it going to be something else?"
1666720,1669300," Okay, maybe recoil offset."
1669300,1670680," I think that's a better name."
1670680,1672680," Recoil offset."
1672680,1676860," And in the spirit of zero initialization, right?"
1676860,1682080," In the spirit of zero initialization, zero means there is no recoil."
1682080,1684760," And one means that it's going to be upset."
1684760,1686220," Right."
1686220,1688660," So recoil offset."
1691320,1694580," The problem is that it's a recoil offset ratio, right?"
1694580,1696300," So it's from zero to one."
1696300,1700220," The actual distance of the recoil will be defined by a constant."
1700220,1703100," So that's another problem that we have here."
1703100,1706240," Asset vars."
1706240,1708620," And where is the gun?"
1708620,1710180," Do we have a gun constant?"
1710180,1710740," Yeah, there we go."
1710740,1714220," Entity gun recoil offset."
1714220,1714860," Right."
1714860,1718540," And let's say that it's going to be around maybe 200s."
1718540,1719900," Like maybe 200s."
1719900,1720220," Cool."
1721320,1725740," And yeah, it's going to be from zero to one."
1725740,1730020," Defined by the constant that we can change in runtime."
1730020,1731500," Yeah, sure."
1731500,1733920," All right."
1733920,1735600," So let me see."
1735600,1736260," Let me see."
1736260,1739240," So I'm going to go to the weapon CPP."
1739240,1743960," And when I'm rendering the gun, when I'm rendering the gun."
1743960,1749380," So this is the actual destination."
1750100,1751300," Do I want to?"
1751300,1755400," So here is the begin."
1755400,1757440," And we can do something like."
1760220,1775200," So this is the angle."
1775200,1775660," So this is the angle."
1775660,1783120," So that means, how did I use angle?"
1783120,1790760," Cool."
1790760,1792700," So I need to subtract polar."
1792700,1802420," Magnitude is going to be entity gun."
1802420,1806120," Entity recoil offset."
1806900,1809340," And the angle is going to be the angle of the gun."
1809340,1810020," Yes."
1810020,1811620," This is how it's going to be done."
1811620,1813480," So this is how it's offset."
1813480,1822180," Actually, offset multiplied by gun recoil offset ratio."
1822180,1823660," So this is how it's going to go."
1827160,1831220," So maybe we're going to call it recoil offset vector, right?"
1831220,1833420," And it's going to be something like const auto."
1833420,1836460," Recoil offset vector."
1836460,1838600," And this is what we're going to have here."
1838600,1841060," All right."
1843260,1844500," Is it going to compile?"
1844500,1845460," Is it going to compile?"
1845460,1846160," Let's find out."
1846160,1847420," It's going to be minus B."
1847420,1849180," Something debug."
1849180,1852020," Changing constants."
1855860,1870260," I'm tired."
1870260,1884280," I'm tired."
1885860,1913120," It's snowing in the UK today."
1913120,1914320," First time in a year."
1914320,1915220," Oh, congratulations."
1915860,1919900," We had snow since the fall, I think."
1919900,1922640," I think in November we already had a lot of snow."
1922640,1924700," First and last time."
1924700,1925360," I see."
1925360,1927640," Welcome to the tired club."
1927640,1932460," So, okay, cool."
1932460,1935860," Now, when I do..."
1935860,1939700," When I do..."
1939700,1942880," I need to set recoil offset to one."
1944140,1949920," So, if you're a gun, we do a gun recoil offset one."
1949920,1954860," And that does not animate the weapon, though."
1955920,1958680," So, we'll have to do that somehow."
1958680,1959160," So, we'll have to do that somehow."
1959160,1966820," Gun has no member recoil offset vector."
1966820,1967200," Okay."
1967200,1969540," Because it's a ratio."
1969540,1974040," Yesu, yesu, yesu."
1974040,1975240," Kawaii, yesu."
1976700,1977320," All right."
1977320,1979180," So, let me run this thing."
1979180,1980480," And now, if I do a..."
1980480,1983480," Well..."
1983480,1987640," That's very interesting."
1987640,1993880," Something is wrong with the angles."
1993880,1997960," How do we even use angles?"
1998080,1998500," Oh, we..."
1998500,1999400," Oh, shit."
1999400,2000380," Oh, fuck."
2000380,2001520," Oh, shit."
2001520,2003620," This is a wrong angle."
2003620,2006920," Because this angle is in degrees."
2006920,2009720," But we need the radians."
2009720,2011660," If we used ADA,"
2011660,2013600," if we used ADA,"
2013600,2018660," we would have had separate types for degrees and radians."
2018860,2022400," And that bug would have been caught by the ADA compiler."
2022400,2026160," But since we are programming in C slash C++,"
2026160,2028960," there's no way we can do that."
2028960,2029740," I'm sorry."
2029740,2034020," It is what it is and it isn't what it isn't."
2034020,2040660," So, we'll have to separate them."
2040660,2042120," But it's so deep."
2042120,2044400," What?"
2044400,2048240," Just use Boosting is lab versa."
2048600,2048900," You see."
2048900,2050720," Okay."
2050720,2052700," So, we're going to have rads."
2052700,2056740," Shazovaku-sama, what's up?"
2056740,2057960," What's up, Shazovaku?"
2057960,2059100," How are you doing?"
2059100,2060020," Really good to see you."
2060020,2062340," Degrees."
2062340,2065160," And we're going to have rads."
2065160,2068680," Angle rads."
2068680,2074140," So, now I'm going to have something like angle rads."
2074140,2077140," And this is..."
2078340,2079960," Angle degrees."
2079960,2085640," Is it going to compile?"
2085640,2086660," Is it going to compile?"
2086660,2090640," 10 billion nested boost templates to convert..."
2090640,2093400," 3 billion nested boost templates."
2094680,2096600," Yes, convert degrees to radians."
2096600,2097800," All right."
2097800,2099500," So, boom."
2099500,2102220," And, well..."
2102220,2103240," Okay."
2103240,2104360," I think..."
2104360,2105880," I think it works."
2105880,2107060," Yeah."
2107060,2107700," I think it worked."
2107700,2109680," It's just the recoil is too huge."
2109680,2111580," That's the problem here."
2111580,2112660," No, no, no, no, no."
2113000,2114960," The thing worked."
2114960,2116060," The recoil is too huge."
2116060,2118880," All right."
2118880,2120520," So, let me go to bars."
2120520,2122340," And recoil offset."
2122340,2123480," If you make it like 100."
2123480,2124680," Yeah."
2125020,2128560," So, around like 50 or 40 would be way better."
2128560,2129540," Right."
2129540,2130380," I'm going to do it."
2130380,2130820," Oh."
2130820,2132720," Yeah."
2132720,2133940," So, like around..."
2133940,2134860," Maybe even 50."
2134860,2137180," Yeah, boy."
2137760,2141160," What if you render a weapon behind the player?"
2141160,2142820," That would be actually kind of cool, I think."
2142820,2146640," Smacked in the face by the gun."
2146640,2147700," ASDF."
2147700,2148260," Yeah."
2148260,2151620," So, okay."
2151620,2152980," So, before I'm going to try to do that,"
2152980,2154900," I want to implement the animation."
2154900,2160660," Unfortunately, we don't have updates for the weapons."
2160660,2163720," We don't have updates for the weapons."
2163720,2166120," So, I have to implement something like this."
2166120,2167740," So, here's a weapon HPP."
2168240,2172480," And you can render, shoot, and get the icon of this thing."
2172480,2173900," But you can't update it."
2173900,2175100," So, we have to do update."
2175100,2181380," Are you using the game engine?"
2181380,2181980," Yeah."
2181980,2183080," I'm using just SDL."
2183080,2186660," So, it's going to be float delta time."
2186660,2190480," So, let's implement this shite."
2190480,2195040," I probably have to put this thing somewhere here."
2197760,2203000," Game plus engine 2 in 1."
2203000,2204420," Inseparable."
2204420,2204640," Yeah."
2204640,2206020," That's basically what it means."
2206020,2207280," Okay."
2207280,2208420," So, we're going to switch"
2208420,2213040," upon the type of this thing."
2214320,2214760," Zozin."
2214760,2214840," Zozin."
2214840,2217120," Use virtual function."
2217120,2220160," Why are you not using virtual function?"
2220160,2223320," What's wrong with you, Zozin?"
2223320,2226540," BADZODIIN!"
2226540,2239600," Stimp."
2239600,2241060," Monka2s."
2241060,2242240," What the fuck?"
2242240,2243660," I'm trying to press O."
2244140,2244440," Okay."
2244440,2246300," Okay."
2246300,2249260," So, when I'm dating the gun, what I'm essentially doing?"
2249260,2259000," If gun recoil offset ratio is greater than zero, I'm doing the following thing."
2259000,2263860," I'm subtracting it at a time."
2264920,2271260," Entity gun recoil speed."
2271260,2273620," Could be recoil speed, yes."
2273620,2278680," Otherwise, we essentially always set it to zero, maybe."
2278680,2283120," Maybe not."
2283120,2284760," Maybe it's just a waste of time."
2285900,2286220," All right."
2286220,2288360," So, entity recoil speed."
2288360,2292420," Essentially, if it's greater than zero, it's always going to be slowly put back."
2292420,2297280," And the question is, is it going to be one second?"
2297280,2299360," Let's start with one second."
2299360,2303380," I think one second is a pretty good idea for the recoil thing."
2303380,2306600," And it's not going to work, by the way, because we never call this function anywhere."
2306600,2308080," Right."
2308080,2309960," Expect it."
2309960,2310400," Oh, yeah."
2310400,2311000," Sure."
2315700,2317340," Cheers, by the way."
2317340,2326900," I went to a C++ job interview with 15 years of experience in various industries under my belt,"
2326900,2328920," and they were trying to fist buzz me."
2328920,2331780," Well, but the question is, did you succeed in fist buzz?"
2331780,2337420," Because I would imagine that somebody with 15 years of experience would succeed in fist buzz,"
2337420,2339160," and that's pretty much the point, isn't it?"
2345500,2347940," I do understand that it's insulting."
2347940,2349180," Yes, it is insulting."
2349180,2352240," But it should be doable for you, in any case."
2359240,2370740," This buzz is not inverting the tree, though."
2370740,2374820," By the way, do you guys know how to invert a tree?"
2374820,2377140," How to invert a binary tree?"
2377140,2378260," Hmm?"
2378260,2379920," Do you know how to do that?"
2379920,2382960," Tell me."
2383740,2386360," Do you want me to show how to invert a binary tree?"
2386360,2392960," True story."
2392960,2396800," I failed to implement fist buzz properly once, like, last month."
2396800,2397160," Really?"
2397580,2403900," Well, I mean, you also have to take into account the stress of the interview."
2403900,2409260," So, I can imagine, like, pretty talented developers failing fist buzz because of the stress."
2409260,2410600," So, yeah."
2413320,2415100," Your mic is, like, making some noise."
2415100,2416320," This is my voice, dude."
2416320,2426180," Just invert the tree."
2426180,2429180," NPN is still invert binary tree."
2433180,2449500," So, and by the way, this is not going to work because we never call the updates."
2461700,2467040," Maybe somebody is actually banging against your wall."
2467040,2471720," So, maybe it's something on your part."
2471720,2477760," The part I'm not comfortable with was I showed them my portfolio of projects and shipped products"
2477760,2481180," I was part of and they were still fist buzzing me."
2481180,2487220," But, I mean, how can you prove that this, so that you actually played a major role in this"
2487220,2490880," project and you don't, you know, was carried by somebody or something?"
2491040,2491580," I don't know."
2491580,2493640," I'm not defending them, by the way."
2493640,2494760," I'm not defending them, by the way."
2494760,2496060," I'm just saying."
2496060,2498920," How it works with strings in C?"
2498920,2500720," Depends on what you want to do with them."
2500720,2503540," I mean, like, do you always go for malloc in options?"
2503540,2506220," Not, you don't have to always work for malloc in option."
2506220,2510220," Strings in C are arrays, so they also work as arrays."
2510220,2517340," And arrays in C can be allocated in dynamic memory, in static memory, and in the stack."
2517440,2520600," So, you have three places where you can put your string in."
2520600,2523480," So, and how you work with strings?"
2523480,2525080," Well, depends on the situation."
2525080,2529360," Sometimes it's easier to allocate it on the heap, which is quite rare, by the way."
2529360,2535820," Sometimes it's easier to allocate it on the stack, or sometimes it's easier to have it on the static memory."
2535820,2538400," It just depends on what you're doing with them, honey."
2539260,2539660," Seriously?"
2539660,2542280," All right."
2542280,2547260," All right, let's continue."
2547260,2551400," What else do we have here?"
2551400,2558200," So, how do I call..."
2558200,2563960," So, essentially what I'll have to do, I'll have to iterate through all of the alive entities,"
2564320,2566980," and update their current weapons."
2566980,2568500," I guess that's what I'll have to do."
2568500,2570980," Let's see."
2570980,2572060," Let's see."
2572060,2572700," Let's see."
2572700,2575440," So, update."
2575440,2578480," So, I'm going through..."
2578480,2583040," I'm slowly going through all of the entities."
2583040,2592140," But, to be fair, since we're not even touching the weapons of the enemies,"
2592140,2596100," we might as well only update the player's weapon."
2596100,2597920," That makes sense."
2597920,2600620," So, weapon."
2600620,2602800," Entity weapon."
2602800,2606900," Yeah, okay."
2606900,2607940," So, here's the player."
2607940,2610780," Is this really..."
2610780,2611340," Oh, my God."
2611480,2611760," Okay."
2611760,2613320," Update."
2613320,2617300," So, here's the player."
2617300,2620300," And in the entity somewhere..."
2620300,2623560," Do I have a current weapon?"
2623560,2624980," Yeah."
2624980,2626880," So, you can literally take the current weapon."
2626880,2627440," Cool."
2627440,2632480," So, player gets current weapon."
2632480,2636760," And I'm going to just update it with delta time."
2636760,2638120," Do I have a delta time there?"
2641120,2646040," Delta time is not there."
2646040,2647920," Because it's called DT."
2647920,2654900," First try."
2654900,2657120," Okay."
2657120,2657920," Chat, are you ready?"
2657920,2659700," For a first try, gutcoder moment."
2659700,2660580," A-pum."
2660580,2661340," A-pum."
2661340,2661820," A-pum."
2661820,2662240," A-pum."
2662240,2662760," A-pum."
2663440,2665240," It actually recoils very slowly."
2665240,2666520," So, we have to adjust that value."
2666520,2669860," So, uh..."
2669860,2670740," Vars conf."
2670740,2673020," So, I think recoil could be a little bit faster."
2673020,2674500," Like half of a second, I think."
2674500,2675240," Would be better."
2679240,2681040," Okay, that's..."
2681040,2683300," That's really dumb."
2683300,2684840," Uh..."
2684840,2685340," Wait a second."
2686960,2687560," Um..."
2687560,2690260," So, that was almost first try."
2690260,2693360," So, essentially..."
2693360,2696100," It's not really recoil speed."
2696100,2698000," All right."
2698000,2699820," So, that means we'll have to..."
2699820,2700660," Like, the distance."
2700660,2702440," So, it has to be twice as big as now."
2702440,2703880," Uh..."
2703880,2705800," Maybe..."
2705800,2706760," Half."
2706760,2709560," What about three?"
2709560,2710400," Maybe five."
2710400,2711620," It feels like five should be."
2711620,2718580," Uh..."
2718580,2719360," What about ten?"
2719360,2721760," Yeah."
2721760,2722440," Ten is good."
2722440,2726380," Uh..."
2726380,2727220," Maybe eight."
2727220,2729900," Yeah."
2729900,2730280," That's..."
2730280,2730780," That's good."
2730780,2732660," Uh-huh."
2733880,2736120," Uh..."
2736120,2737920," Maybe recoil is too huge as well."
2737920,2740880," So, we wanna probably adjust..."
2740880,2742240," Uh..."
2742240,2743500," The recoil offset."
2743500,2744920," What about, like, thirty?"
2744920,2747760," Uh..."
2747760,2748360," Maybe even twenty."
2748360,2750880," Uh..."
2750880,2751180," Ten."
2751180,2754680," Uh..."
2754680,2754840," Twenty."
2754840,2756760," Yeah, I think..."
2756760,2757580," I think twenty is..."
2757580,2757900," Is good."
2763880,2764500," Uh..."
2764500,2769040," What do you guys think?"
2769040,2771560," Oh."
2771560,2779000," I think it's good."
2779000,2781920," Uh..."
2781920,2783000," What about generating brass?"
2783000,2784560," Do you have a to-do for that?"
2784560,2785140," Uh..."
2785140,2787040," Like, I have it on the back of my head, but..."
2787040,2787480," Uh..."
2787480,2789060," I'm not sure if I'm gonna actually implement that."
2789060,2790100," It's like a..."
2790100,2791300," You know, additional..."
2791300,2794960," Additional particles and whatnot."
2794960,2798020," Yeah, yeah."
2798020,2799060," So, Jamek actually mentioned it."
2799060,2799320," I see."
2799320,2802840," Um..."
2802840,2803160," All right."
2803160,2805640," Recoiler should scale with the rate of fire."
2805640,2806460," Not a bad idea."
2806460,2808800," But I don't feel like implementing it right now."
2808800,2809640," So..."
2809640,2811340," All right."
2811340,2812380," So..."
2812380,2813720," Okay, I'll go..."
2813720,2814720," Um..."
2814720,2818340," Three, five, six."
2818340,2822640," Implement recoil animation for the gun."
2822640,2825000," Um..."
2825000,2826440," Okay."
2826440,2828720," So, let me do the full rebuild."
2828720,2831020," Just to check if I didn't screw up anything."
2831020,2838400," Can you move bullet sprites up by a bit so that they actually fly out of the bullet hole thingy?"
2838400,2838800," Probably."
2841340,2844760," It looks a little better than one pixel wide red line."
2844760,2845100," Yes."
2845100,2846200," It does look better."
2846200,2850060," Okay."
2850060,2854060," So, the full release build."
2854060,2856120," Okay."
2856120,2857320," So, look good."
2857320,2860260," Let's try to build it on all of the other platforms now."
2860260,2861800," Mm-hmm."
2861800,2865020," So, that was actually first-time feature."
2865020,2867580," Three, five, six."
2868220,2869880," So, I have some notifications."
2869880,2871560," Do I have anything on topic?"
2871560,2874020," Do I have anything on topic?"
2874020,2874480," Let's see."
2874480,2877440," Mm..."
2877440,2877940," Mm..."
2877940,2879660," Okay."
2879660,2881660," So, everything is virtual machine related."
2881660,2883540," So, I'm going to check that a little bit later."
2883540,2884740," What's up?"
2884740,2885280," Stop gaming."
2885280,2888160," Mm..."
2888160,2888800," Hello?"
2888800,2891100," I'm going to sneeze, by the way."
2891560,2896900," So, this is how much code it took."
2896900,2900720," So, what else do we have to do?"
2900720,2905240," Enemies don't have their weapons rendered."
2905240,2908760," So, I think this is something that needs to be fixed, chat."
2910100,2910540," Yes."
2910540,2911920," I do think so."
2911920,2914800," Yeah."
2914800,2916760," So, maybe this is what we should work on."
2916760,2920720," Because the enemies can, like, they can shoot, right?"
2920720,2924860," And they use, like, they shoot by using the gun weapons."
2924860,2927420," But you cannot see them because I'm Pepega."
2927420,2928340," Right."
2928340,2930560," So, and..."
2930560,2935080," Holy shit."
2937140,2937700," Yeah."
2937700,2938880," That's so epic."
2938880,2942560," Small gun."
2942560,2944160," No, it's a big gun."
2944160,2952060," To be fair, when you're moving like that, recoil is barely visible."
2952060,2953680," Okay."
2953680,2955780," Only when you're standing and stuff."
2955780,2957320," But, yeah."
2957320,2957780," Fighting."
2957780,2963200," Fighting with the enemy that also, like, jumps and does all this stuff is actually super fun."
2963200,2966160," Oh, fuck."
2966680,2967200," Oh, shit."
2967200,2967740," Yes."
2967740,2968260," Yes."
2968260,2969800," This is so fun."
2969800,2970320," Holy shit."
2970320,2970860," I like it."
2970860,2974380," Cool."
2974380,2977740," Alright."
2977740,2980200," Is the continuous integration done?"
2980200,2982260," God gamer."
2982260,2982960," Yeah."
2982960,2984820," That's my own game."
2984820,2989260," Looks like controlled by a real person."
2989260,2990840," Well, yeah."
2990840,2992340," That's how good AI is."
2992340,2994020," Oh, you mean the player?"
2996220,3000340," Oh, why do you feel so tired today?"
3000340,3001680," I don't know."
3001680,3002960," I feel really tired."
3002960,3003240," I don't know."
3003240,3007920," Even though I have my second cup of tea."
3007920,3009600," Better than Cyberpunk."
3009600,3013220," Well, I mean, it's actually a very simple game."
3013220,3015140," Five hat going."
3015140,3015920," Yeah."
3017920,3020120," Bunnyhopping 360 no scoping."
3020120,3020660," Yeah."
3020660,3025820," Can you 360 no scope?"
3025820,3028700," So, essentially, like, in that case, it's going to be..."
3028700,3031020," Oh, excuse me."
3035020,3035960," It's hard."
3035960,3038520," It's because the mouse goes outside of this thing."
3038520,3038920," But, yeah."
3038920,3044160," Oh, shit."
3044160,3045420," I have an idea."
3045420,3049340," I think the time has come"
3049340,3052760," to replace the current sprite."
3054760,3056380," I like this idea."
3056380,3057780," We're going to use"
3057780,3058820," Tsojin Pogue."
3058820,3062320," Tsojin Pogue."
3062320,3063240," PNG."
3063240,3065460," The bot is dead."
3065460,3066180," I'm sorry."
3066180,3070600," So, the thing about"
3070600,3072180," this stuff is that"
3072180,3073400," it has to be inversed."
3073400,3073720," Right."
3075300,3076860," So, can I flip it"
3076860,3077800," with convert?"
3077800,3079420," Is it possible to flip it"
3079420,3080020," with convert?"
3080020,3080740," Flip."
3080740,3083120," Alright."
3083120,3085660," Flip image vertically."
3085660,3086500," But what about"
3086500,3087840," horizontally?"
3087840,3090860," Are you fucking serious?"
3090860,3094440," This is hilarious."
3094440,3095920," To flip vertically"
3095920,3096940," you use flip to"
3096940,3098240," to flop?"
3098240,3098880," What?"
3098880,3101320," Is that a..."
3101320,3104700," Alright."
3104820,3105500," Let's give it a try."
3105500,3106360," Convert."
3106360,3107620," Flop."
3107620,3108820," Yeah."
3108820,3109420," Flip flop."
3109420,3112280," That is funny."
3112280,3114800," Okay."
3114800,3117500," So, Tsojin Pogue."
3117500,3121920," No image defined at..."
3121920,3122640," Oh, yeah."
3122640,3123260," You have to do"
3123260,3124060," something like this."
3124060,3125160," Okay."
3125160,3128680," Tsojin Pogue."
3128680,3130400," Can I do it like that?"
3130400,3132620," And if I take a look at it..."
3132620,3134180," Yes."
3134340,3135520," It's been officially"
3135520,3136080," flopped."
3136080,3137640," So, and then"
3137640,3138800," I go to the vars."
3138800,3139620," Right."
3139620,3140600," I go to the vars"
3140600,3141720," and actually assets..."
3141720,3143940," Tsojin W."
3143940,3146140," And I'm going to put"
3146140,3146900," Pogue in here."
3146900,3148960," So, that should be..."
3148960,3149600," That should be enough."
3149600,3150260," This is not what"
3150260,3150820," I wanted to do."
3150820,3153440," Alright."
3153440,3155320," So, where is"
3155320,3156780," my other stuff?"
3158720,3159180," Okay."
3159180,3159180," Okay."
3159180,3160440," Let's recompile everything."
3160440,3166240," Let's recompile."
3166240,3169620," Yeah."
3169620,3172280," That's perfect."
3172280,3173300," I like it."
3173300,3176320," That's so good."
3185460,3186360," Tsojin Pogue."
3186360,3189600," It's a gemmaniac."
3189600,3190300," Exactly."
3190300,3192620," Alright."
3192620,3195240," So, I'm definitely going to do that"
3195240,3197040," after the continuous integration is done"
3197040,3198680," because I don't want to wait another round"
3198680,3199820," of continuous integration."
3199820,3203260," Because it takes a little bit too much time"
3203260,3204920," right now."
3206920,3216240," So, the next issue is going to be"
3216240,3216740," what?"
3216740,3218500," Oh, rendering the weapons"
3218500,3219060," for the enemies."
3219060,3221020," Just a second."
3221020,3222040," I need to quickly"
3222040,3223360," go to the kitchen."
3223360,3224200," Just a second."
3224200,3228080," I'm going to open this thing here."
3228080,3230080," Just watch the maniac."
3236660,3262380," We need..."
3262380,3263520," Well, probably."
3263520,3265480," But this is not a final look"
3265480,3266400," and feel of the game anyway."
3266400,3267120," it's just, you know,"
3267120,3269760," just a test in art."
3269760,3277200," Holy shit."
3277200,3278020," This is so fun."
3278020,3280160," Love it."
3280160,3281320," Okay."
3281320,3282120," So, we're still waiting"
3282120,3283380," for continuous integration."
3283380,3287600," Well, yeah."
3287600,3289160," It's actually a very interesting idea"
3289160,3290940," of using"
3290940,3292360," like this emote"
3292360,3293600," for different situations"
3293600,3294520," and different emotions"
3294520,3294520," and different emotions."
3294520,3295800," It's not a bad idea."
3295800,3298420," But I actually envisioned"
3298420,3299680," like slightly different game."
3299680,3300140," I'm sorry."
3300140,3308840," Free BSD, by the way."
3308840,3313520," Still waiting for free BSD."
3317020,3318960," So, don't have their weapons rendered."
3318960,3320540," So, essentially,"
3320540,3321180," we can just"
3321180,3322920," only render"
3322920,3324600," the current weapons."
3324600,3326700," Well, I mean,"
3326700,3327320," this is exactly"
3327320,3328640," what's needed anyway."
3328640,3330200," Tube damage."
3330200,3330640," Yes."
3330640,3333160," That's what it could be."
3335660,3336140," All right."
3336140,3336140," All right."
3336140,3336660," Is it ready?"
3336660,3337400," Oh, my God."
3337400,3338780," I swear to God."
3338780,3342580," It just makes it"
3342580,3343340," so painful."
3343340,3345900," Seven minutes."
3347660,3357460," Is this even English?"
3357460,3370640," What the fuck is this?"
3370640,3372700," Yeah."
3372700,3374120," I think at some point"
3374120,3374640," I will remove"
3374640,3375740," free BSD integration."
3375740,3376420," I'm really sorry."
3376700,3377520," here are some plots"
3377520,3378740," because it's just like"
3378740,3379560," holy shit."
3379560,3381800," It takes so much time."
3381800,3389860," It's just like"
3389860,3391120," a reasonable amount of time"
3391120,3392700," because it's just not worth it."
3392700,3399620," And I cannot start developing"
3399620,3400840," until I merge it."
3400840,3401120," Right."
3401120,3402540," So, I really need to wait"
3402540,3403780," until the end of it."
3403780,3404080," Like,"
3404080,3406680," it's just like"
3406680,3409000," stalls the whole development process"
3409000,3409880," and I'm already forgetting"
3409880,3411420," what I was wanting to do."
3411420,3424880," Holy shit."
3424880,3425680," I don't care."
3425680,3426580," Seriously."
3426580,3426840," Like,"
3426840,3427900," I really don't care."
3427900,3428900," Just merge it already."
3428900,3429320," Okay."
3430160,3432480," So, I can put it like that."
3432480,3450400," So, then I can put it like that."
3450400,3454500," And I think everything is automatically merged."
3454500,3455320," Nice."
3455320,3460240," So, let's put it like this."
3460240,3461200," So, let's put it like this."
3461200,3467200," Change the player sprite."
3467200,3469780," The main player sprite."
3469780,3470960," Push that button."
3470960,3471480," There we go."
3471480,3477340," All right."
3477340,3486960," You know what?"
3486960,3490280," I think I'm going to finish the stream."
3490280,3493260," I'm extremely tired today for some reason."
3493260,3497160," And, yeah."
3497160,3499640," I cannot push for four hours today."
3499640,3500520," I don't know why."
3501580,3503880," So, I guess I'm going to call it a day today."
3503880,3504980," I'm really sorry, boys and girls."
3504980,3505720," I'm really sorry."
3505720,3507600," I'm really fucking tired."
3507600,3510440," So, thanks everyone."
3510440,3512360," Who's watching right now."
3512360,3513440," I really appreciate it."
3513440,3515580," Have a good one."
3515660,3516700," I'm going to see you tomorrow."
3516700,3523140," Tomorrow, we're going to have a virtual machine development in C."
3523140,3525640," So, yeah."
3525640,3529760," Check out the schedule for more information on different projects we're working on."
3529760,3533080," So, we work on different projects and stuff like that."
3533080,3536760," Also, check out our VODs channel where we upload our recordings."
3536760,3538200," So, the stream is going to be there."
3538200,3542440," But tomorrow, I'm actually going to split this stream into two separate VODs."
3542440,3545360," The 8 of VOD is going to be its own separate video."
3545560,3547840," The game development one is going to be its own one."
3547840,3553340," And also, check out our Discord server for offline discussion with the community."
3553340,3555980," And maybe, I don't know."
3555980,3557520," I don't feel like reading anyone."
3557520,3558180," I'm really tired."
3558180,3562680," Thank you, Jamie, for your poems for 13 months of T1 subscription."
3562680,3564980," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
3564980,3566280," And, yeah."
3566280,3568060," I see you all tomorrow."
3568060,3568960," Love you all."
3568960,3569480," Mwah."
3575560,3605540," Thank you."
