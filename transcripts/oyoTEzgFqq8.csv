880,5120," Hello, everyone, and welcome to another ZOZIN session."
5120,6160," How about that?"
6160,7560," Bet you're doing SPOZIN!"
7560,14580," So, some time ago, I found a pretty cool extension for Emacs."
14580,19540," It's called FixMe, with, as you can see, double E, right?"
19540,23860," And what it does, it basically, like, goes through all of your buffers"
23860,29020," and collects all of the to-dos into this, you know, like, aggregate view."
29120,31380," And it also allows you to jump between them."
31380,35680," And one of the cool features of this extension, as I demonstrated some time ago,"
35680,39280," is that how it handles urgency, right?"
39280,41560," So, here you have an urgency tab."
41560,45280," And if you want to increase the urgency of a particular to-do,"
45280,48460," you just add an extra leading character, right?"
48460,52280," So, instead of to-do, you say to-do with double O at the end."
52280,55240," And that gives it an extra point of urgency."
55240,60500," In fact, the more O's it has at the end, the higher the urgency, right?"
60500,65580," So, I thought it's a pretty cool idea because it makes it super easy to bump the urgency"
65580,68440," or reduce the urgency just by adding or removing the character."
68440,70740," And it works with FixMe as well."
70740,74540," So, there is, like, a section with explanation on how it works, right?"
74580,79440," So, you can use FixMe, or you can use to-do, and, yeah, that's pretty cool."
79440,82400," And it also sorts them by the urgency, right?"
82400,85080," So, if you found an issue that you want to work like next,"
85080,89260," you can basically bump up the urgency and then refresh this thing."
89260,90300," And it's going to be at the top."
90300,92220," And you can just basically sort by that urgency."
92840,96000," So, I'm going to put the link to this extension in the description"
96000,97360," because I think it's a pretty cool idea."
97360,98280," I really like that idea."
98280,100600," So, let me find the description file."
100600,103200," Where is my current description file?"
103200,104120," There's too many of them."
104120,104360," Okay."
104360,109120," So, FixMe extension for Emacs, right?"
109120,110980," So, let's actually capitalize Emacs."
110980,112080," Okay."
112740,117500," But I found a problem with this extension is that, for some reason,"
117500,123140," when I close the Emacs, it takes, like, a couple of seconds to close."
123140,126680," And, look, I just closed the Emacs, and I'm waiting."
126680,129800," It's not even a couple of seconds."
129800,131300," It's actually quite a lot of time."
131300,132780," I have no idea what is it doing."
132780,136980," Maybe it's sending all of my personal information to the author of this extension."
136980,139000," I don't actually know, so I'm not going to accuse anyone."
139520,143940," So, yeah, but I know for a fact that it's caused by that extension"
143940,148620," because if I disable that, it's not happening anymore, right?"
148620,150020," So, let's actually do FixMe."
150020,151820," I'm going to comment it out."
151820,155340," So, if I close Emacs right now, it's going to take, you know,"
155340,158000," several seconds to close because it's still on, right?"
158000,159380," So, we're going to wait a little bit."
159380,166020," And then, if I start Emacs yet again without that extension, right,"
166020,168720," and I just close the Emacs, it closes instantaneously."
169100,171860," So, obviously, it's something within this extension,"
171860,175920," and I'm pretty sure it's a bug that needs to be reported and maybe fixed."
175920,179180," At the beginning, I thought, well, I mean, I really like the extension."
179180,181180," Maybe I'm going to report that and fix it."
181180,182940," Maybe somebody already reported that, by the way."
182940,184160," I never looked into the issues."
184160,189240," So, looks like nobody reported that."
189240,191740," Maybe somebody reported that in the closed issues or something like that."
191740,201100," But anyway, so, but then I thought that this is a very cool idea that is kind of editor agnostic."
201100,207300," You see, like, this idea is tied to a specific editor."
207300,214120," But what if we had a tool like fix me that utilizes the same urgency system,"
214120,216880," but it's not tied to any particular text editor."
216880,224940," So, something like a command line tool that just collects all of you to-dos and just serves them by the urgency without any extension."
224940,229520," So, with that tool, you can easily integrate with any text editor."
229520,232400," So, yeah, what if we had that instead?"
232400,233880," Right."
233880,238180," And then I remembered that I kind of already have such tool."
238180,241360," So, some time ago, I developed a tool called Snitch."
241360,242520," Right."
242520,244260," And this is a very cool tool, by the way."
244260,246120," I still use it from time to time."
246120,250320," Not that often these days because I quite rarely use issue trackers these days for some reason."
250320,256780," But anyway, so what it does, it basically searches for all of the to-dos in your project"
256780,260720," and reports them as issues to the GitHub issue tracker."
260720,262520," In fact, it supports more than GitHub."
262520,264880," I think it supports GitLab and GitI."
264880,266240," I don't know."
266240,272240," People from time to time basically contribute different, like, drivers for different platforms and stuff like that."
272240,277100," I don't remember how many platforms it supports, but it supports GitHub and GitLab for sure."
277100,278360," Right."
278360,280720," So, I'm going to put the link to this thing in the description."
280720,282940," So, let me quickly open Emacs."
282940,285300," And I'm going to open the description."
286520,290000," Snitch, the to-do collector."
290000,293100," There we go."
293100,294400," So, we can find it in the description."
294400,302640," And I thought, why can't I just take this urgency idea and steal it and implement it in Snitch?"
302640,303460," Right."
303460,309740," So, because Snitch on top of reporting the to-dos, it can also show you the list of the current to-dos."
309740,312340," So, this is one of the functionality of Snitch."
313340,313720," Right."
313720,320520," So, if I go somewhere to port, for instance, and I do something like Snitch list, right?"
320600,324860," It goes through the entire project and just shows, like, what to-dos there are."
324860,329760," And you can jump to them if your editor supports parsing this kind of stuff."
329760,331420," And you can just look at them."
331420,342260," And I thought, why not just, like, go ahead and implement that urgency system so the next time you do the list subcommand, it will sort the to-dos by the urgency."
343060,343460," Right."
343460,344640," I think it's a pretty interesting idea."
344640,350440," And that way, this urgency system is going to be text editor agnostic, right?"
350440,353880," Because, like, you can call this tool from any text editor, right?"
353880,356200," So, yeah."
356200,357600," That's what I wanted to do today."
357600,365520," So, the topic of today's session is going to be implementing the fix-mure urgency system in this tool that I've developed."
365520,366060," Right."
366140,368180," By the way, it's written in Go, right?"
368180,370240," If you are into Go, you may like this session."
370240,373740," So, let's take a look at how Snitch works."
373740,375260," Let's do a little bit of a demo."
375260,376500," Right."
376500,382980," So, somewhere here I have a project called Snitch Lab where I experiment with Snitch specifically."
382980,383420," Right."
383420,387160," So, I'm pretty sure I need to fetch the latest changes, right?"
387160,390180," Because I've been experimenting off-screen."
390180,392700," Alrighty."
392700,394600," So, let's-a go."
394700,398140," I'm going to open the text editor and go to the Snitch Lab."
398140,401080," Snitch Lab."
401080,404900," So, let's add a couple of to-dos in here."
404900,406420," So, the first to-do is going to be hello."
406420,409640," Then, somewhere here I'm going to add world."
409640,413720," And then, somewhere here I'm going to add something like fool."
413720,414220," Right."
414220,418700," So, and then I can try to snitch those to-dos up."
418700,419060," Right."
419060,420160," So, if I take a look at the list."
420160,423140," So, here are the to-dos that I have in this repo."
423480,426000," And then, I can say, please report those to-dos."
426000,429560," What it will do, it will detect the current GitHub project."
429560,429940," Right."
429940,436460," And then, it will go interactively through each to-do and ask, do you want to report that?"
436460,442400," And if you answer yes, it will add it to the pending list to report after it went through all of the to-dos."
442600,443860," So, do we want to report hello?"
443860,445460," Yes, we do want to report that."
445460,445900," World."
445900,446600," Okay."
446600,452860," And now, it will go and report all of these to-dos as GitHub issues through the GitHub API."
452860,453560," Right."
453560,454880," And if you look into the project."
454880,455240," Right."
455620,459080," So, where is the GitHub snitch lab?"
459080,461020," Snitch lab."
461020,463000," Right."
463000,464600," So, here they are."
464600,467440," Here are the issues that were reported seconds ago."
467440,469360," 15 seconds ago."
469360,469720," Right."
469720,470660," So, it was recent."
470660,472900," And all of that was created by this tool."
472900,476600," So, on top of that, it also commits all of the edit to-dos."
476840,477000," Right."
477000,483740," So, as you can see, it basically updated to-do and associated it with a specific issue."
483740,484440," Right."
484440,489000," And then, in the commit message, it also referred to the issue it reported."
489000,497920," So, now, if you push these commits and go to the corresponding issues, the commits are going to be mentioned in the issue itself."
497920,498520," Right."
498520,504560," So, essentially, it actually creates a pretty cool situation when, in the source code, you have a to-do,"
504820,508360," and you know what issue this to-do is associated with."
508360,515100," And if you go into the issue, like 100, you know what's the, well, that's pretty kind of strange."
515100,516440," I should have actually reverted that."
516440,517240," Yeah, there we go."
517240,525480," So, and if you go into the specific issue in here, right, if you go into the specific issues, you can see where that to-do is located."
525480,525760," Right."
525760,527200," In which commit it was made."
527200,529040," So, you know, it's located somewhere here."
529040,532920," So, you see, like, there is, like, a double connection between the issue and to-do."
533020,535300," To-do refers to the issue, and issue refers to the to-do."
535300,537100," So, it's actually pretty cool."
537100,538920," Okay."
538920,542880," So, there's also another sub-command, which is called purge sub-command."
542880,551340," Essentially, if you close this issue, if you're done working with these issues, and you close them, the to-dos are still going to be in the source code."
551480,551700," Right."
551700,558460," So, you can use a purge sub-command, which will go through each individual reported to-do."
558460,566120," And through GitHub API, it will check whether that to-do is already closed or not, and it will suggest you to remove that from the source code."
566120,566560," Right."
567120,570780," So, as you can see, it detected that foo is already closed."
570780,571860," Do I want to purge it?"
571860,572720," So, I'm going to say yes."
572720,574520," And yes."
574520,575780," And yes."
575780,576460," And there we go."
576460,577860," It actually removed all of them."
577860,581120," And it made commits removed in all of them."
581120,581420," Right."
581480,586380," So, if I just refresh this file, as you can see, all of the to-dos were removed by the tool automatically."
586380,587760," Right."
587760,592000," So, if we take a look at the commits it made, it actually straight up removed all of these things."
592000,593100," Right."
593100,595500," So, it just goes ahead and removes these lines."
595500,597520," And then you can just push these commits."
597520,599660," This is basically Snitch."
599660,603880," If you are into this kind of stuff, if you're interested in using this tool, feel free to do that."
603880,604700," It's in the description."
604700,610740," And what I want to do, I want to add the urgency system to this tool."
610740,617780," So, basically, when I do list, I want the list to be sorted by the urgency of the to-do."
617780,621720," So, for that, we'll have to do a little bit of modifications."
621720,622880," A little bit."
622880,623760," Just a tiny bit."
623760,626540," I don't really know."
626540,628460," I haven't touched the source code for quite some time."
628460,630820," So, maybe we'll have to refactor everything."
630820,631240," We'll see."
631240,636140," But from what I can remember, it shouldn't take that much of the time."
636140,636800," Right."
636800,638320," Anyway."
638320,640320," So, let me actually fetch the latest changes."
640500,642040," For this specific project."
642040,644780," All right."
644780,647040," So, merge origin."
647040,651800," Actually, I want you to merge origin master."
651800,652420," Let it go."
652420,653820," So, I also have this branch in here."
653820,655140," So, I think I'm going to remove it."
655140,658720," So, if I remember correctly how to build goal projects."
658720,660220," You just do go build dot."
660220,662620," And it will just build everything into the executable."
662620,662920," Right."
663040,664040," So, this is how we do that."
664100,664600," I think so."
664600,667640," I do, in fact, think so."
671640,672600," So, we took some time."
672600,675360," But it's just like it was warming up the hard drive caches."
675360,675920," I think."
675920,677160," I think this is what it was doing."
677160,684520," And then we can go into the snitch folder and just use this snitch as the current one."
684520,685400," So, if we do list."
685840,690200," We won't have anything because we don't have any to do's to, you know, list."
690840,694360," So, first, maybe this one is going to be second."
694360,697500," And this one is going to be third."
697500,698080," Right."
698080,699160," There we go."
699160,701040," If I do list, it just lists them."
701040,703160," But it doesn't list them in urgency."
703160,703500," Right."
703500,705600," In fact, it doesn't even understand the urgency."
705600,711680," If I add a bunch of to do's in here, Veeam also does not understand the urgency."
711680,715780," So, the snitch is not going to even recognize them as to do's."
715780,718580," Because it recognizes the to do by a specific keyword."
718580,719060," Right."
719240,722720," So, it looks specifically for the keyword and then a colon."
722720,723380," Right."
723380,727880," If you have extra characters in there, it will think that it has a different keyword."
727880,734000," So, it's not going to be recognized as the, you know, it's not going to be recognized as"
734000,734940," a to do at all."
734940,738340," So, maybe this is something that we want to extend first."
738340,739680," All right."
739680,741140," So, let's go into the main go."
741140,742200," Right."
742200,745880," And in the main function, where is the main function?"
745880,746980," Func main."
746980,747540," There we go."
748040,750560," So, in the main function, we handle subcommands."
750560,750800," Okay."
750800,752180," So, here's the least subcommand."
752180,756620," We parse the arguments and we just handle some stuff."
756620,759280," And then we do least subcommand."
759280,761740," Least subcommand."
761740,763820," So, it accepts some sort of function."
763820,765800," I'm not really sure what that function is."
765840,766020," Okay."
766020,767420," So, it accepts the project."
767420,767960," Okay."
767960,773000," And project is probably an entity that keeps track of the current project, whether it's"
773000,775940," a GitHub project or GitLab project and stuff like that."
775940,779120," And also, it accepts a filter."
779120,779780," Okay."
779780,782460," So, essentially, the filter takes a to do."
783040,789620," I suppose, the to do that we found in the project and returns false or true, meaning that whether"
789620,790780," you want to display it or not."
790780,792560," And that filter is used."
792560,793280," Oh, yeah."
793280,798800," Because we have a flex like show only reported or show only unreported and so on and so forth."
798840,801160," So, that's why you need some sort of like a filtering in here."
801160,802020," Okay."
802020,802780," That makes sense."
802780,804400," That makes a lot of sense."
804400,807600," So, let's actually go ahead and just look at this subcommand."
807600,815300," So, and what we have in this subcommand, we're using walk to do of directory method of the project."
815300,815580," Okay."
815580,820300," So, you have a project and you can walk to do of a directory of that specific project."
820300,821640," This is actually rather convenient."
821640,822640," Right."
822640,827680," So, you go to each individual to do and that to do satisfies this specific filter you provided."
827680,828840," It will print that to do."
828840,830460," It's as simple as that."
830460,831060," Okay."
831060,834640," So, we need to go deeper and go into the walk to do of directory method."
834640,838640," So, let me actually go ahead and grab for that thing."
838640,840640," Can I just do something like this?"
840640,843200," So, let me see where it's defined."
843200,844520," Looks like it's defined in here."
844520,844760," Okay."
844760,846920," So, what we're doing here."
846920,847380," Oh, okay."
847380,850260," So, we call external git ls files command."
850260,851480," Right."
851480,854560," So, and I suppose if you do git ls files, right."
854880,858360," So, it basically returns all of the files within the project, right."
858360,860060," Committed ones."
860060,862620," I think the ones that are part of the git index."
862620,865980," And then, I suppose, we are iterating through these files."
865980,868040," And what do we do with them?"
868040,868400," Right."
868460,872320," We check that the file exists and it's not a directory."
872320,873820," Oh, yeah."
873820,875100," This one is actually very interesting."
875100,881960," So, the thing about git is that it does not really support folders."
881960,883000," Right."
883060,885020," It only supports files."
885020,888580," And that's why you can't commit an empty folder in git."
888580,888980," Right."
888980,890120," That's a thing, by the way."
890120,890840," Look it up."
890840,891080," Right."
891080,893100," You cannot commit an empty folder in git."
893100,896080," Because git fundamentally does not support files."
896080,899100," For git, I mean, directories."
899100,904960," For git, everything, like, each individual file is sort of stored in, like, a single namespace."
905280,907960," And the path is just part of the file name."
907960,909980," I think this is how it works."
909980,911120," But I might be wrong, by the way."
911120,914380," So, take everything I say about git with the grain of salt."
914380,921080," So, but there are situations when by doing git ls files, you will get a directory."
921080,926160," And that situation is when that directory is a submodule."
926160,929300," And going inside of submodules is actually kind of finicky."
929300,934500," Because effectively, you are going into a separate project, right."
934560,937080," You're moving from one project to another one."
937080,941020," And that kind of requires, like, a context switching of some sort."
941020,946720," And because of that, we just, like, throw a warning saying that we don't go into the submodules or something like that."
946720,949860," So, it's kind of, like, a weird thing that we have to handle."
949860,952400," And I'm really glad that I put a fix me in here."
952400,955180," And also put a warning explaining what the fuck it is."
955180,955780," So, yeah."
955780,957020," Anyway."
957020,962200," So, then we just take this file path and we use the walk to do the file."
962200,962540," Right."
962540,964180," So, we go through all of the directories."
964320,966700," We go through all of the files within the project."
966700,969480," And within that file, we go through each individual to do."
969480,970200," Okay."
970200,972320," So, I'm pretty sure this thing is located somewhere here."
972320,972740," There we go."
972740,974520," So, what are we doing here?"
974520,977040," We open a file, obviously."
977040,977540," Right."
977540,979980," So, we create a buffered reader or something like that."
979980,982420," And we read the file line by line."
982420,984800," So, we're scanning the file line by line."
985640,988320," And here we have a pretty complicated thing."
988320,991100," Oh, I think I even know what that thing is."
991100,992980," because it's a very simple."
992980,996440," How is that called?"
996440,998200," Finite state machine."
998200,998700," I think."
998700,999760," With the two states."
999760,1002940," Looking for to do and collecting a body."
1002940,1006640," Because in like to do's, you can actually have bodies."
1006640,1007140," Right."
1007140,1008440," So, if you do something like this."
1008440,1009900," Look, look, look."
1010060,1010920," So, I'm going to do third."
1010920,1013940," And in here, I'm going to say this is a body."
1013940,1015280," Right."
1015280,1018640," And then I'm going to do pow, pow, pow."
1018640,1019340," I don't know."
1019340,1020320," I don't know what to put in here."
1020320,1020920," Right."
1020920,1025680," And basically, this entire thing is going to be used as the body of the issue."
1025680,1029000," And it's going to be used as the description when you try to report it."
1029000,1029460," Right."
1029460,1035020," And that's why we have like a simple like state machine that keeps track of this entire stuff."
1035020,1035240," Right."
1035240,1038140," So, if you encounter to do, we remember that to do."
1038220,1043400," And we switch to collecting body state until we, you know, don't see body anymore."
1043400,1046300," Body is recognized by the same prefix as the to do."
1046300,1047480," Right."
1047480,1049940," And then we switch back to our original state."
1049940,1052880," So, look, there's a little bit of a finite state thing going on."
1052880,1053580," Okay."
1053580,1054980," So, let's actually see how it works."
1054980,1059260," If I try to do something like snitch report."
1059260,1060120," Right."
1060120,1063600," As you can see, it recognized this to do as the issue."
1063600,1066120," And it also recognized this as a body."
1066120,1067940," This one is very interesting."
1068060,1069080," So, it actually parsed it."
1069080,1072220," If I say yes, it will report everything appropriately."
1072220,1073660," So, let's take a look at this thing."
1073660,1075980," So, here it is."
1075980,1078380," If you take a look at the third, here's the body."
1078380,1079480," So, yeah."
1079480,1082580," So, it put in the description whatever you put below to do."
1082580,1088500," So, the first line of to do, like the first thing after the keyword to do is used as the title."
1088500,1093420," And then everything below with the same prefix as the to do is used as the body."
1093420,1093880," Right."
1094220,1095720," So, that's basically what's going on here."
1095720,1095880," So, that's basically what's going on here."
1095880,1098000," All right."
1098000,1101340," So, but when we encounter to do, all right."
1101340,1103820," We have, we take our line."
1103820,1107760," Oh, and we have a method to line as to do."
1107760,1109220," That's very interesting."
1109320,1110240," So, let's take a look at this method."
1110240,1111120," What it does."
1111120,1113600," Line as to do."
1113600,1114800," Hmm."
1114800,1115640," Okay."
1115640,1116380," That's very interesting."
1116380,1119520," So, this is probably where we parse this thing."
1120480,1122440," And we try to do two things."
1122440,1125120," We try to parse it as unreported to do."
1125120,1128560," The difference between reported and unreported to do is the following."
1128560,1128940," Right."
1128940,1132180," So, this is unreported to do."
1132180,1134960," And this is a reported one."
1134960,1139260," It has an associated issue number with it."
1139260,1139720," Right."
1139720,1140840," So, that's what it has."
1140840,1142580," So, that's the difference between them."
1142580,1146920," And because of that, they have to use different regular expressions to be parsed."
1147460,1151000," So, first, we try to parse it as unreported one."
1151000,1154620," And then, if we didn't succeed, we try to parse it as a reported one."
1154620,1159480," And if we didn't succeed either, we just return nil, indicating that this line is not a to do."
1159480,1161660," Like, try to parse the other lines."
1161660,1162780," Okay."
1162780,1165860," So, I think we'll have to modify both of these methods."
1165860,1166360," Right."
1166360,1166920," I think."
1166920,1169700," So, let's actually go into the unreported to do."
1169700,1173120," And what we're trying to do in here."
1175840,1179740," So, unreported to do regular expression."
1179740,1181560," Oh, and okay."
1181560,1182100," So, I see."
1182100,1183520," Here's the thing."
1183520,1192740," The keyword in snitch can be customizable."
1192740,1195640," The keyword is whatever you use to indicate the to do."
1195640,1196780," It can be to do."
1196780,1198060," It could be fix me."
1198060,1199400," It could be XXX."
1199400,1200440," It could be your mom."
1200440,1201920," Whatever you want."
1201920,1202280," Right."
1202620,1204660," So, and this is customizable."
1204660,1205320," Right."
1205320,1208740," And it's part of the project."
1208740,1209080," Right."
1209080,1210700," So, project has a list of keywords."
1210700,1214380," And we're trying to parse this stuff with all of the keywords."
1214380,1216120," Okay."
1216120,1217220," So, that's pretty cool."
1217580,1225080," So, now we have to use those keywords to actually construct a slightly different regular expression."
1225080,1237960," So, basically we have to look at this last character of the keyword and use that last character in the regular expression saying that you can have several of such last characters."
1237960,1251940," And also, the parsed to do also contains the keyword with which it was parsed because then this information can be used to recover the original text of the to do."
1251940,1252440," Right."
1252440,1257540," And you need to recover it when you turn unreported to do into reported one."
1257540,1257940," Right."
1258160,1261180," So, as you can see over here, to do is sort of deconstructed."
1261180,1261460," Right."
1261460,1262340," So, it has a prefix."
1262340,1263260," It has a suffix."
1263260,1264100," It has a keyword."
1264100,1264960," It has an ID."
1264960,1266340," And so on and so forth."
1266340,1268020," And if you take a look at something like this."
1268020,1269220," To do title."
1269220,1269740," Right."
1269740,1274980," So, the prefix for this to do is going to contain literally this."
1274980,1275440," Right."
1275440,1277300," So, this is a prefix."
1277300,1281000," It has three tabs, slash, slash, and space."
1281000,1282480," This is a prefix."
1282480,1290600," And it's very important to keep track of it because you want to be able to recover the line character by character of this specific to do."
1290600,1292340," Then we have a suffix."
1292340,1294520," And a suffix is basically this."
1294520,1294940," Right."
1294940,1297400," Everything after colon space."
1297400,1298020," Right."
1298020,1299160," So, this is the suffix."
1299160,1301760," And it's used at the title of the issue."
1301760,1304360," And keyword is whatever you have in here."
1304360,1304840," Right."
1304840,1309800," And since you can have different keywords, you can have a fix me in here."
1309800,1310300," Right."
1310300,1316480," And as you basically recover the actual line of to do, you have to put that keyword in here."
1316480,1319140," So, that's why we keep track of the keyword as well."
1319140,1323300," So, if we start adding this urgency thing."
1323300,1323640," Right."
1323640,1325660," So, we start to have like several of these things."
1325660,1329480," So, how should we keep track of this thing?"
1329480,1334160," Because we also need to be able to recover the urgency."
1334720,1335020," Right."
1335020,1337600," I suppose we're going to actually store."
1337600,1341120," We're going to store the urgency and the number."
1341120,1341720," Right."
1341720,1344500," So, let me actually try."
1344500,1346700," So, where is this struct to do?"
1346700,1350740," I think it's something like type to do."
1350740,1352100," But where is it defined?"
1352100,1354020," It's defined in a different place."
1354020,1355620," So, it's probably defined somewhere here."
1355620,1356280," There you go."
1356280,1358200," So, here's the keyword."
1358200,1361100," And we're going to have urgency."
1361100,1365980," I hope I spelled urgency correctly."
1365980,1366440," Did I?"
1366440,1367980," Did I spell it correctly?"
1367980,1369720," Can I just do I spell on this thing?"
1371160,1372420," two, two, two, two, two, done."
1372420,1373100," Okay."
1373100,1374360," So, maybe I don't know."
1374360,1376820," My ISPEL plugin for Emacs doesn't work recently."
1376820,1377380," I don't know why."
1377380,1378360," Okay."
1378360,1379380," So, we have an urgency."
1379380,1379960," Right."
1380040,1384080," And I think we can use this number as basically an indication."
1384080,1392180," How many of the leading characters of the keyword to duplicate when we recover the to-do."
1392180,1393320," Right."
1393320,1396320," So, and I suppose by default it's going to be zero."
1396320,1399520," And that means you duplicate zero characters in here."
1399520,1404100," And then if you have one, you add additional character and so on and so forth."
1404100,1404460," Right."
1404460,1407580," So, we also have to make sure that this is never going to be negative."
1408140,1410340," Maybe we could put something like unsigned in here."
1410340,1412880," But I don't know if Golang supports unsigned characters."
1412880,1415160," I also don't know if that's idiomatic or not."
1415160,1417060," And to be fair, I don't even care."
1417060,1420480," So, anyway."
1420480,1422520," So, we have urgency."
1422520,1429140," And in here I'm going to say maybe I don't even have to specify the urgency."
1429140,1434260," The fields that I don't specify in here, they automatically basically zeroed out if I remember correctly."
1434260,1435180," So, it doesn't really matter."
1436940,1437440," Okay."
1437440,1440780," So, let me, let me think."
1440780,1443620," Let me, let me think."
1443620,1448120," So, we need to modify the unreported to do a regular expression."
1448120,1448500," Right."
1448500,1450460," So, and what we do in here, right."
1450460,1455240," What we do in here, we just quote the keyword."
1455240,1455720," Right."
1455720,1456660," We just quote the keyword."
1456660,1462940," And we basically sandwich it between the regular expression for the prefix and regular expression for the suffix."
1462940,1470120," So, what I want to do in here, in fact, is just take the first character of the keyword."
1470120,1471440," So, it's going to be keyword zero."
1471440,1477380," Also, that means that we expect that the keyword has at least one character."
1477380,1479220," Otherwise, this thing is going to be impossible."
1479780,1481760," Does go even perform range checks?"
1481760,1485580," I think it does perform the range checks, but just, well, how it doesn't have a cert."
1485580,1486560," God damn it."
1486560,1486860," Anyway."
1488120,1489700," So, I'm going to just do that."
1489700,1507340," So, and what we have to do in here is just, we have to construct a regular expression that basically says that you can have zero or more of these characters after this thing."
1507340,1508260," Somehow."
1508660,1511720," I have no idea how, but we can try, right."
1511720,1515240," So, we can use this keyword like so, right."
1515240,1516400," So, this is going to be that thing."
1516400,1522660," And then I'm going to say you're going to have like many of them, or maybe you're going to have none of them."
1522660,1528600," So, also, I think we need to wrap that into a group, right."
1528680,1535700," We definitely need to wrap that into a group because we then want to extract that and use it as an urgency, right."
1535700,1537660," So, that's what we want to be able to do, right."
1537660,1539120," So, here is another group in here."
1539120,1544080," So, I wonder if you have to also quote this thing."
1544080,1546940," Maybe it does make sense to quote it just in case."
1546940,1548760," And I'm not sure if it's going to work, right."
1548760,1551860," Maybe we'll have to turn it into a string or something like that."
1551860,1552260," We'll see."
1552260,1552640," We'll see."
1552640,1555640," So, okay."
1555740,1561040," And it's kind of interesting that I have to do the same thing for reported to the regular expression."
1561040,1563440," But let's just focus on and reported to this, right."
1563440,1565980," Let's just add support specifically for those things."
1565980,1569800," And that kind of messes up the groups, as you can see."
1569800,1573040," So, here the first group used to be the prefix."
1573040,1574820," The second one used to be the suffix."
1574820,1577860," But the second one now is the urgency, right."
1577860,1581720," So, that means we have to put like three in here."
1581720,1585040," And here I'm going to do urgency, right."
1585140,1589240," Urgency, groups, and this is going to be two."
1589240,1589760," There we go."
1589760,1592480," So, we have a prefix, urgency, and suffix."
1592480,1593320," And there we go."
1593320,1599260," So, once we have this urgency suffix, we can use it like this."
1599260,1602880," We're going to take the length of that urgency suffix."
1602880,1603620," Right."
1604260,1606560," So, that should be it."
1606560,1607540," Believe it or not."
1607540,1608220," I think."
1608220,1611040," This is actually quite cool that it's relatively simple."
1611040,1613120," But I'm not sure if I'm missing anything in here."
1613120,1614960," So, I'm not even sure if this entire thing compiles."
1614960,1616860," But that's the general idea."
1616860,1618120," Okay."
1618120,1619580," So, here we have a single byte."
1619680,1622840," So, maybe I have to first turn it into a string."
1622840,1623340," Right."
1624280,1625680," And is it going to compile?"
1625680,1627040," It seems to be compiling, actually."
1627040,1627800," That's pretty cool."
1627800,1628940," That's pretty pug."
1628940,1629740," Not in the way."
1633000,1638260," So, if I now try to do a list, it didn't work."
1638260,1646620," It didn't work because it didn't really recognize those things as us to do's anyway."
1646620,1647660," Hmm."
1647660,1651160," To do, to do, to do, to do, to do."
1651160,1652380," Okay."
1652380,1656000," So, we can try to do a little bit of a logging."
1656000,1656500," Right."
1656500,1658060," So, here's the main end of Java."
1658060,1661560," So, these things are, in fact, to do's."
1663000,1666700," Then, maybe, I just want to see what's going to be the regular expression."
1666700,1670240," Can I just, like, go ahead and see?"
1670240,1670800," Right."
1670800,1677940," So, this is the rejects, the rejects, which I'm going to put in here."
1677940,1678500," Right."
1678500,1679620," So, here is the rejects."
1679620,1681840," And then, I just do it like that."
1681840,1685420," And then, I want to do fmt print ln."
1685420,1691700," Then, I'm going to just print that thing."
1692520,1697540," And, can I just panic afterwards, saying something like, lol?"
1697540,1701120," Because, because I want to see what kind of regular expression was generated in here."
1701120,1702700," And, whether it's correct or not."
1702700,1703400," Because, who knows?"
1703400,1705360," All right."
1705360,1707120," So, let me try to run this in there."
1707120,1708560," Look, this is not what I want you to run."
1708560,1709920," I want you to just run this thing."
1709920,1710880," Okay."
1710880,1711840," So, this is what..."
1711840,1712320," Ah!"
1712320,1713600," I'm an idiot."
1713600,1716140," I should use the last one."
1719520,1720520," Okay."
1720520,1723260," How do you take the last one?"
1723260,1725080," Do you just do length minus one?"
1725080,1726580," I think you just do length minus one."
1726580,1729500," Length keyword minus one."
1729500,1731240," I guess that's how we do that."
1731240,1731800," All right."
1731800,1734740," So, I'm really glad that I decided to actually print this thing."
1734740,1736560," And, just, like, see what's going on."
1736560,1737040," And, there you go."
1737100,1740200," So, this is more or less proper regular expression."
1740200,1743100," So, let me now get rid of all of that."
1743100,1745600," Okay."
1745600,1750440," So, all right."
1750440,1752240," So, and as you can see, yeah."
1752240,1753200," We have all of them."
1753200,1755260," But, as you can see, it doesn't print the urgency."
1755260,1757560," If you take a look at the original things."
1757560,1758960," The original things."
1758960,1761080," These things have multiple to-dos."
1761580,1764740," But, if you do a list, they don't have multiple to-dos."
1764740,1767940," Because, the to-do is not recovered correctly."
1767940,1772180," The recovery of the to-do does not take into account the urgency."
1772180,1773000," But, it should."
1773000,1776120," So, let me take a look at how we can do that."
1776120,1777260," If I remember correctly."
1777260,1777780," Right."
1777780,1778740," If I remember correctly."
1778740,1779920," This is how we do that."
1779920,1781440," We do log string."
1781440,1782160," Right."
1782160,1783440," This is the log string."
1783440,1785400," So, let's find log string."
1785500,1786860," I think it's located somewhere in to-do."
1786860,1789100," Log string."
1789100,1791660," And what we do in here."
1791660,1793020," What we do in here."
1793020,1793360," Yeah."
1793360,1795600," So, we literally do just this thing."
1795600,1797960," So, there's also string."
1797960,1800420," There's a lot of things."
1800420,1804640," There's a lot of functions that recover the function."
1804640,1805720," The to-do."
1805720,1808280," Log string formats to-do for compilation logging."
1808280,1810580," Format is compatible with Emacs implementation."
1810580,1812040," So, we can easily jump between these two."
1812040,1815940," So, I suppose this is for specifically logging."
1815940,1820120," And this is for like an actual recovery."
1820120,1820700," Right."
1820700,1822300," It is for actual recovery."
1822300,1822900," Okay."
1822900,1825020," Fair enough."
1825020,1826200," Fair enough."
1826200,1828500," So, if there is a to-do."
1828500,1829740," We treat it."
1829740,1831000," I mean, if there is no to-do."
1831000,1832360," We treat it as a reported one."
1832360,1833240," If there is a to-do."
1833240,1834580," We treat it as a reported one."
1834580,1836480," And that's basically it."
1836480,1838440," So, what we have to do in here."
1838440,1841680," We just have to stick this like a single character in here."
1842240,1844640," But I wonder what's going to be the easiest way to do that."
1844640,1849540," Can I just repeat a character several times in printf?"
1849540,1854140," So, golang printf repeat character."
1854140,1855820," Is that a thing I can do?"
1855820,1859180," Repeating a string for specific number of times in golang."
1859180,1859440," Okay."
1859440,1860660," So, is that a thing?"
1860660,1861800," Geek for geeks."
1861800,1862520," Geeks for geeks."
1862520,1864020," My favorite resource of all time."
1864680,1866140," So, who's better, by the way?"
1866140,1868440," What website is better, in your opinion, guys?"
1868440,1870860," Is it Stack Overflow or geeks for geeks?"
1870860,1871580," I don't know."
1871580,1876140," So, these days, like, I find more useful information on geeks for geeks."
1876140,1878140," Even though I have no idea what the fuck is this website."
1878140,1881360," Like, it's just like whatever comes at the top in Google."
1882360,1882920," All right."
1882920,1884640," So, what do we have in here?"
1884640,1886620," So, how do I replicate this thing?"
1886620,1889060," Are you going to ask me for..."
1889060,1889540," Of course."
1889540,1891920," Anyway."
1891920,1893480," So, we have strings repeat."
1893480,1894800," Cool."
1894800,1897700," I guess that's fine."
1897700,1898480," We can use that."
1898480,1898780," Why not?"
1899760,1900500," Let me see."
1900500,1904960," So, can I do something like go, doc, strings, repeat?"
1904960,1906900," All right."
1906900,1908580," So, and, yeah."
1908580,1914360," Repeat returns a new string consisting of count copies of string s."
1914360,1919560," It panics if count is negative or if the result of length overflows."
1919560,1919980," Okay."
1919980,1920660," That makes sense."
1920660,1923660," So, that looks good to me."
1923660,1925880," That, in fact, looks very good to me."
1925880,1927340," So, can I just include..."
1927340,1929160," Oh, we already have strings included."
1929760,1931320," So, essentially..."
1931320,1932320," So, here's the file."
1932320,1933600," Name has a line."
1933600,1934840," Here is the prefix."
1934840,1935940," Here is the keyword."
1935940,1938100," And here we should have the urgency."
1938100,1939980," So, what I'm going to do in here."
1939980,1942560," I'm going to take a to-do keyword."
1942560,1947040," Length to-do keyword minus one."
1947040,1950180," So, then I turn this into a string."
1950180,1951040," Right."
1951040,1953360," I turn this into a string and I repeat that string."
1953360,1956360," The urgency amount of times."
1956360,1957020," Right."
1957020,1959320," And we can take the urgency."
1959760,1961960," From the to-do itself."
1961960,1962240," Right."
1962240,1963260," So, this is going to be urgency."
1963260,1964560," So, to be fair."
1964560,1967560," This entire thing is pretty huge."
1967560,1973480," So, maybe I'm going to turn it into something like urgency suffix."
1973480,1974000," Right."
1974000,1975740," And I'm going to just save it in here."
1975740,1978200," Urgency suffix."
1978200,1978900," Like so."
1978900,1982920," And so, I can reuse this entire thing in here as well."
1982920,1983420," Right."
1983660,1986060," So, because it's pretty reusable in my opinion."
1986060,1988740," Urgency suffix."
1988740,1989460," There we go."
1989460,1990700," So, this is what we've got."
1990700,1993960," This is what we've got."
1993960,1996620," So, this string."
1996620,2003760," What I'm thinking is that why don't we reuse this string inside of the log string?"
2004760,2008400," Because it feels like I will have to duplicate that code everywhere."
2008400,2009980," But I mean, that's fine, I suppose."
2009980,2011660," I suppose that's fine."
2011660,2013620," This is something that could be fixed later."
2013620,2014780," This is old code."
2014780,2015100," Okay."
2015100,2016120," And there you go."
2016120,2019300," So, here we have urgency recovered in the log."
2019300,2020960," Isn't that POG?"
2020960,2022360," I think that's pretty POG."
2022360,2023600," In my opinion."
2023600,2025400," I think it's pretty goddamn POG."
2025400,2031100," So, and we kind of have to repeat the same thing for the string in here."
2031220,2032500," So, let's actually quickly do that."
2032500,2033800," So, this is going to be urgency."
2033800,2037980," And after the keyword, I have to use the urgency suffix."
2037980,2040900," And this is another one."
2040900,2043640," Urgency suffix."
2043640,2044480," There we go."
2044480,2045340," All right."
2045340,2047320," So, that's pretty POG."
2047320,2048980," Cool."
2048980,2054540," So, I think we still don't support that for the reported to do's."
2054700,2062600," If I go into main, right, and I add some urgency to this to do that is already reported."
2062600,2066300," Let's actually add the biggest amount of urgency."
2066300,2067320," So, it's going to be at the top."
2067320,2068840," And then I'm going to do a list."
2068840,2073940," It's not even there because for the reported to do this, we have not implemented that yet."
2073940,2075560," So, this is something that we'll have to do."
2075560,2076540," Okay."
2076640,2079260," So, I think it's located somewhere in the project."
2079260,2079860," All right."
2079860,2081360," So, unreported."
2081360,2083660," There we go."
2083660,2084440," There we go."
2084440,2086740," So, here is the reported to the regular expression."
2086740,2089860," And I just have to copy paste this thing there."
2089860,2095000," I think I'm starting to remember how to work with this code base, which is actually pretty POG."
2095780,2096220," Okay."
2096220,2099020," So, this is how we construct all of that."
2099020,2100560," This is how we construct all of that."
2100560,2105540," So, and now we have to find the line as reported to do."
2105540,2106140," Right."
2106140,2108000," The line as reported to do."
2108000,2116880," So, that again messed up the suffixes and prefixes and stuff like that."
2116880,2120160," So, before this was the first one."
2120160,2124760," The second, well, the second one is still the urgency."
2125760,2126480," Okay."
2126480,2129600," So, we'll probably have to do something like urgency."
2129600,2132480," It's going to be groups."
2132480,2133300," Second one."
2133300,2135560," And I think this one has to be the fourth one."
2135560,2137760," But the ID has to be the third one."
2137760,2139020," I think."
2139020,2142300," So, let me see actually."
2142300,2142680," Okay."
2142680,2148880," So, we'll probably have to split the view because I can't see shit in this list."
2148880,2152000," So, as reported."
2152000,2154780," So, the first one is the prefix."
2154780,2155200," Okay."
2155480,2157540," The second one is the urgency."
2157540,2158000," Right."
2158000,2158840," That makes sense."
2159880,2164800," So, the ID is kind of like a third."
2164800,2165060," Yeah."
2165060,2166240," It is a third one."
2166240,2168160," And the suffix one is the fourth one."
2168160,2168340," Okay."
2168340,2169920," So, if we just like put them in order."
2169920,2170740," That makes sense."
2170740,2173960," I can even like align regular expression like this."
2173960,2174380," And there we go."
2174380,2175280," It looks nice."
2175280,2176300," It looks beautiful."
2176300,2177280," My God."
2178280,2178720," Anyways."
2178720,2181140," So, hopefully that is working."
2181140,2182260," That is twerking."
2182260,2185820," So, now I can just like assign the urgency here as well."
2185820,2187840," And that should be it."
2187840,2188660," Believe it or not."
2188660,2191540," That should be enough to do the job."
2191760,2193540," And it is listed in here."
2193540,2194200," Right."
2194200,2196340," So, it is in fact listed in here."
2196340,2201080," But the problem here is that it is not sorted according to the urgency."
2201080,2201700," Right."
2201700,2203760," So, this is kind of a shame in my opinion."
2203760,2208420," So, we'll have to fix that."
2209480,2210540," Let's go ahead and fix that."
2210540,2213780," So, I think this has to be fixed in the list subcommand."
2213780,2214040," Right."
2214040,2217780," So, here we are basically printing them right away."
2217780,2218540," Right."
2218540,2219740," We're printing them right away."
2219740,2221000," But what we need to do."
2221000,2224700," We need to actually collect them first into some sort of like a list."
2224700,2226940," And then sort that list."
2226940,2228240," Sort that slice."
2228240,2228800," I think."
2228800,2230980," According to the urgency."
2230980,2231520," Right."
2231520,2232460," Let's go ahead and do that."
2232460,2235580," We're already kind of using sorting for the purge."
2235580,2238020," So, let me see how we do that."
2239320,2240820," So, yeah."
2240820,2241720," This is how we do that."
2241720,2242980," It actually looks pretty straightforward."
2242980,2246180," And it actually sorts everything in place."
2246180,2247160," Which is nice."
2247160,2248100," Okay."
2248100,2252640," So, let me go ahead and create something like to do's to list."
2252640,2253160," Right."
2253160,2255500," And this is going to be basically a list of to do's."
2255500,2256780," To list."
2256780,2258360," And in here."
2258360,2260220," Instead of like printing them right away."
2260220,2261800," What we're going to be doing."
2261800,2262700," We're going to be adding them."
2262700,2265460," We're going to be appending them to the to do's to list."
2265460,2266140," Right."
2266140,2268740," To do's to list is going to be equal append."
2269160,2271700," To do's to list to do."
2271700,2272200," There we go."
2272200,2273300," So, we've got this stuff."
2273300,2276520," So, and now we need to sort this entire thing."
2276520,2278660," So, let me find how you sort that."
2278660,2279380," Sort."
2279380,2280380," Yeah."
2280380,2281480," So, we have to do."
2281480,2285040," So, this should be probably assigned to an error."
2285040,2288000," And if error is not equal to new."
2288000,2290500," We're going to return the error."
2290620,2292420," I think classic classic."
2292420,2294200," Does it even return?"
2294200,2294380," Yeah."
2294380,2295200," It does return error."
2295200,2297300," So, you're not supposed to actually crash in here."
2297300,2299360," So, then we do sort slice."
2299360,2301200," Let's actually sort all of these things."
2301200,2302880," To do's to list."
2302880,2303280," Right."
2303280,2303880," To do's to list."
2303880,2305120," We're going to accept the."
2305380,2306940," I suppose these are the indices."
2306940,2307460," Right."
2307460,2312820," And it basically returns whether one is greater than another."
2312820,2313340," Right."
2313340,2319800," So, and in this particular case, what we're going to do to do's to list I urgency."
2322500,2323860," How do you spell urgency?"
2323860,2324160," Okay."
2324160,2324600," There we go."
2324600,2328860," So, greater than the urgency of J."
2328860,2329680," Right."
2329680,2331620," Greater than the urgency of J."
2331620,2333780," And you have to return this thing, I suppose."
2333780,2336380," And that should be it, I think."
2336380,2336880," Right."
2336880,2338160," So, the next thing we need to do."
2338160,2339840," We need to iterate through all of this to do's."
2339840,2340160," Right."
2340160,2341000," So, it's going to be to do."
2341000,2345100," Arrange to do's to do's to list."
2345100,2345560," Right."
2345560,2346260," To do's to list."
2346260,2348180," And what we're going to be doing."
2348180,2350120," We're going to be basically doing this thing."
2350120,2350820," All right."
2350820,2352240," So, we're going to be doing the logging."
2353280,2353800," Right."
2353800,2355380," Log this string."
2355380,2359800," So, hopefully that will make them log according to their urgency."
2359800,2360180," Wait."
2360180,2361180," Let's actually do that."
2361180,2366900," I think I forgot to return new, indicating that everything is Gucci."
2366900,2369960," To do's to list, it's never used."
2369960,2370280," Really?"
2370280,2370920," What?"
2370920,2372120," Oh, yeah."
2372120,2374780," So, it has to be equals because I declared a new one."
2374780,2376180," Okay."
2376180,2381560," So, if I try to do this thing, it's sorted according to its urgency."
2382080,2383000," Isn't that amazing?"
2383000,2384320," I think it's goddamn freaking amazing."
2384320,2384580," Okay."
2384580,2387660," So, if I just make it the regular urgency."
2387660,2388200," Right."
2388200,2390120," If I just make this a regular urgency."
2390120,2392560," And now it is actually down there."
2392560,2395560," So, they are in fact sorted by their urgency."
2395800,2400520," And this approach is in fact editor agnostic."
2400520,2404660," Meaning that it will work not only in Emacs, it will also work in Vim."
2404660,2406040," And I'm going to show you in a second."
2406040,2406680," Right."
2406680,2407780," So, let's take a look at Emacs."
2408320,2415900," If I do, if I use the compilation mode of Emacs and just do something like snitch, snitch list."
2415900,2416340," Right."
2416340,2416860," There we go."
2416860,2420220," So, I can already jump between these things."
2420220,2420600," Right."
2420600,2422420," So, without a fix me extension."
2422420,2422760," Right."
2422800,2427060," So, the only thing I needed is this external tool and the compilation mode."
2427060,2427420," Right."
2427420,2429180," So, that's the only things I needed in here."
2429180,2430780," Which is kind of cool."
2430780,2434940," And at any point, I can just bump up the urgency for a particular thing."
2434940,2436060," Restart this entire stuff."
2436120,2438480," And as you can see, it's sorted according to the urgency."
2438480,2439020," Right."
2439020,2442120," So, and how will it work in Vim?"
2442120,2443360," Well, this one is interesting."
2443360,2447300," So, as far as I know, in Vim, you can use the make command."
2447300,2450940," Like, I don't really know Vim that much."
2450940,2451240," Right."
2451240,2454200," So, maybe there are more extensions for this kind of stuff in Vim."
2454200,2457780," But I only know about the standard one, which is like through the make command."
2457780,2458420," Right."
2458420,2462080," So, in the make command, I think you have to set up make program."
2462080,2463180," So, make PRG."
2463180,2465860," And you have to set it to snitch."
2466020,2466200," Right."
2466200,2467520," So, this is going to be snitch."
2467520,2469000," Right."
2469000,2470220," So, you have to escape this thing."
2470220,2471660," And you have to put a list in here."
2471660,2475260," Then, if you do make, right, it will just print you this thing."
2475260,2481200," And then, you can have a window in which you can actually jump between different to-dos."
2481200,2487320," So, as you can see, this thing works like in any editor that can parse the output of snitch."
2487320,2487700," Right."
2487700,2491040," So, this is what I meant by an editor agnostic solution."
2491040,2495020," I'm pretty sure Visual Studio Code is capable of parsing these kind of things."
2495680,2498800," Sublime probably is capable of parsing this kind of stuff."
2498980,2503420," Well, definitely, it has like a build mode and it knows how to parse this thing."
2503420,2505040," You can even customize the regular expression."
2505040,2510600," So, this urgency idea is very cool, props to the author of fix me."
2510600,2512060," I really like this idea."
2512060,2514580," Check out this extension and see if it works for you."
2515420,2516800," And I'm still in that idea."
2516800,2517800," I'm sorry."
2517800,2519740," I really like that idea."
2519740,2521800," I think it's pretty lovely."
2521800,2527740," I really like how easily you can just bump up the urgency of a particular to-do."
2527740,2528200," Right."
2528200,2531080," And just like, yeah, it's just like add additional character."
2531080,2531900," It's just super cool."
2532480,2533440," I really like that."
2533440,2534380," Anyway."
2535340,2537320," So, what else do we need to do in here?"
2537320,2538660," What else do we need to do in here?"
2538660,2540060," I think that's pretty much it."
2540060,2542240," So, that's the entire stuff."
2542240,2546900," Maybe we want to test how, you know, reporting works."
2546900,2547220," Right."
2547340,2558820," Because during the reporting, we are recovering the original line and we need to make sure that while reporting the to-dos with extra urgency, we are not losing the urgency because this is something that could happen."
2558820,2562260," Also, now we have a whole room of possibilities."
2562260,2567980," This urgency can be basically maybe bound to a particular label in GitHub."
2567980,2568860," I don't know."
2568860,2570480," We can implement that in the future."
2570480,2571080," Right."
2571080,2572480," So, we have an urgency."
2572480,2576500," We can sort by that urgency, but we can actually do more with that urgency."
2576500,2576780," Right."
2576860,2581760," So, maybe we can do something issue tracker specific on that."
2581760,2582240," We'll see."
2582240,2583860," Anyway."
2583860,2587480," So, let me see how it works if I have urgency in here."
2587480,2588860," Okay."
2588860,2591420," So, I'm going to do list and I'm going to say report."
2591420,2592560," Right."
2592560,2593680," So, it's, yeah."
2593680,2595500," As you can see, it recovers everything perfectly."
2595500,2598140," I'm going to say report and report."
2598140,2601100," Hopefully, looks good."
2601100,2601640," Right."
2601640,2603260," It recovered everything properly."
2603260,2604800," And now, if I take a look."
2604800,2606580," Oh, shit."
2606640,2607740," This one is very interesting."
2607740,2614820," So, in the commit message, in the commit message, it does not recover the urgency."
2614820,2617160," But maybe that's fine."
2617160,2619220," Maybe that's fine."
2619220,2621180," I'm not sure yet."
2621180,2623400," Should the commit recover the urgency or not?"
2623480,2623880," But anyway."
2623880,2627680," So, the most important thing is the urgency here in the source code."
2627680,2628900," It is here in the source code."
2628900,2630560," So, the urgency was not lost."
2630560,2638840," So, I'm not sure if the commit message should actually, you know, show, like, recover the urgency."
2638840,2639840," I don't know."
2640620,2640960," We'll see."
2640960,2641000," We'll see."
2641000,2644460," I don't see that being something super important right now."
2644460,2647020," To be fair, to be fair, to be fair."
2647020,2647280," Okay."
2647280,2648800," So, I'm going to create a separate branch."
2648880,2650140," I'm going to call it urgency."
2650140,2650960," I'm going to call it urgency, right?"
2650960,2651920," So, here's the urgency."
2651920,2653780," All right."
2653900,2671320," So, and what we're going to do is basically say, implement fix me style, fix me style urgency system for list subcommand, this subcommand."
2671320,2675560," So, and we're going to refer to this explanation, right?"
2675560,2680100," So, see this for more info, right?"
2680100,2681380," So, and there we go."
2681380,2684140," We have created a commit."
2684140,2688800," But I think we also need to document the entire thing, right?"
2688800,2690660," So, we need to document the urgency system."
2690660,2693760," So, let me, let me see."
2693760,2695580," Let me, let me see."
2695580,2696800," Let me, let me see."
2696800,2699720," Parsing value expression."
2699720,2704880," Okay."
2704880,2708420," So, we are explaining how we parsing unreported to do's."
2708420,2715840," And I feel like what we need to do in here, we need to add this thing in here."
2715840,2719260," So, we're going to do something like O and this is a space."
2719260,2721660," So, here we have to say this is a group three."
2721660,2723600," But here we're going to say group two."
2725500,2735040," urgency, suffix, suffix, suffix, used to, okay, let me actually do it."
2735040,2744620," Used to indicate the urgency of the, of the to do, right?"
2744620,2754380," Maybe we should create like a section called urgency, like see urgency for more info, right?"
2755080,2772540," Used to indicate the urgency of the to do, the higher amount of O's, the more urgent the to do, the to do is."
2772540,2773740," Doesn't that make any sense?"
2773740,2774160," I don't know."
2774160,2775960," Used to indicate the urgency of the to do."
2776040,2785420," The higher the amount, the higher the amount of O's, the more urgent the to do is."
2785420,2786480," Is that a good English?"
2786480,2787540," Because I don't speak English."
2787540,2789660," I think it's a decent English."
2789660,2793160," The higher the amount of O's, the more urgent the to do is."
2793160,2795220," So, I don't know."
2795220,2796660," I don't speak English."
2798200,2801280," All right, so we have a group here as well."
2801280,2804800," And I think I'm going to just copy paste this entire stuff, right?"
2804800,2805860," So, I'm going to have that."
2805860,2808300," So, this one becomes three and four."
2808300,2811060," And this becomes group, group two."
2811060,2816380," We're going to say urgency suffix, right?"
2817680,2821140," And I'm going to literally copy paste this entire thing, right?"
2821140,2822980," Copy paste in the documentation."
2822980,2824360," Okay."
2824360,2827200," So, to do body, blah, blah, blah, parsing."
2827200,2830860," So, so this is the example."
2830860,2834900," Parsing, switch removes the to do prefix."
2834900,2841080," All of the consequent lines with the body is reported as the issue description."
2841080,2844540," Okay, a remote specification."
2844540,2848440," So, here is the remote specification, installation, credentials."
2848440,2852040," I'm just thinking where I want to put all of that."
2852040,2854200," So, here is the usage, custom keywords."
2854200,2860580," Maybe we should put that in the usage, custom keywords, issue tile transformation."
2860580,2867880," Oh, it's just a switch, a snitch.yaml."
2867880,2870700," Okay, development run."
2870700,2874100," I'm thinking where should I put the urgency?"
2874100,2874760," Let's see, right?"
2874760,2878040," So, there is installation, credentials."
2878040,2879820," Okay."
2879820,2882360," So, maybe I'm going to put it somewhere here."
2882360,2883820," So, here's the example."
2883820,2890200," Oh, I just remembered."
2890200,2892000," I can actually fold these things."
2892000,2892460," Right."
2892460,2895380," So, I'm having a hard time to actually comprehend what the fuck is going on."
2895380,2899080," Because I don't understand, like, what's the structure of this entire thing."
2899140,2904440," Okay, so, how it works, we explain, like, briefly how it works, this to-do format."
2904440,2905760," Right."
2905760,2906280," So, okay."
2906280,2912480," So, I think the urgency should go into the to-do format, because it's a part of the to-do format."
2912480,2913020," Right."
2913020,2916520," We have a to-do body, we have an example, we have parsing."
2916520,2918900," Okay, that makes sense."
2918900,2919920," That makes a lot of sense."
2919920,2921860," So, here we're going to do something like urgency."
2921860,2923340," Okay."
2924680,2935860," The urgency, urgency system was stolen from FixMe, FixMe Emacs extension."
2935860,2936440," Right."
2936440,2940880," So, I'm going to refer to this specific explanation in here."
2940880,2941360," Right."
2941360,2943240," Okay."
2943240,2950860," So, random, the distinguished feature, the urgency of each notice alone, the user urgency, indicated by, okay."
2950860,2950940," Okay."
2954680,2956340," Um, right."
2956340,2960540," So, to-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, urgency of FixMe."
2960540,2961880," All right."
2961880,2964060," So, I think I'm going to steal this entire thing."
2964060,2965440," Uh, right."
2965440,2966700," And I'm going to just adapt it."
2966700,2971060," I'm going to just change it up so it's not obvious that I stole this work."
2971060,2971440," Right."
2971860,2981560," So, urgency of, um, to-do's, um, urgency notices is indicated."
2981560,2982300," Okay."
2982300,2995080," The urgency of to-do's, to-do's, uh, is indicated by repetition of the final character of the keyword."
2995080,2995740," Right."
2995740,2999300," And you can actually have several keywords and the keywords can be customized."
2999300,3003420," For example, one might, uh, write, um, to-do."
3003420,3004180," All right."
3004180,3008980," So, let's actually use, uh, to-do how many e's we have in here."
3008980,3009980," We have nine e's."
3009980,3013200," So, I can just do something like, oh, for an important issue."
3013200,3014760," Uh, okay."
3014760,3032780," The, uh, list, uh, sub-command, a sub-command will sort, uh, the to-do's, um, uh, will sort the to-do's."
3033420,3038880," Uh, in the descending order by their urgency."
3038880,3039400," Okay."
3039400,3042660," So, the urgency system was stolen from fix.me emacs extension."
3042660,3048920," The urgency of to-do's is, uh, indicated by repetition of the final character of the key, of the keyword."
3048920,3052380," For example, one might write to-do for an important issue."
3052380,3056900," The list sub-command will sort the to-do's in the descending order by their urgency."
3056900,3057980," Right."
3059420,3063540," So, uh, I guess that's a pretty, like, reasonable explanation."
3063540,3064140," I don't know."
3064140,3067660," Uh, do we want to do anything else to, like, where is the to-do body?"
3067660,3071680," Oh, I think, I think I did a fucky-wacky and oopsie-doopsie."
3071680,3072180," Right."
3072180,3074480," So, here's the to-do and I have to put it in here."
3074600,3074860," Okay."
3074860,3080360," So, here is the to-do body and here's the urgency and we're good to go."
3080360,3082100," Uh, okay."
3082100,3083800," Hopefully, everything's fine."
3083800,3086180," Uh, document."
3086180,3090060," Document the urgency system."
3090060,3090580," Right."
3090580,3092000," Document the urgency system."
3092160,3095860," And I suppose I need to go through the continuous integration checks."
3095860,3096220," Right."
3096220,3097220," So, this is going to be Travis."
3097220,3100240," Uh, and I just want to take a look at the GoFMT."
3100240,3103880," Let's do GoFMT and, uh, force it to write the things."
3103880,3105020," All right."
3105020,3110060," So, GoFMT apparently didn't like me actually aligning these things appropriately."
3110060,3110780," Right."
3110840,3113340," So, GoFMT forces me to write ugly code."
3113340,3114820," Thank you so much, GoFMT."
3114820,3115460," Very cool."
3115460,3116600," Uh, all right."
3116600,3118120," So, we're going to do the following thing."
3118120,3120940," Fix GoFMT remarks."
3120940,3122060," Absolutely disgusting."
3122060,3122580," Okay."
3122580,3124040," So, what else do we have in here?"
3124040,3125140," So, we also have VET."
3125140,3126660," Uh, I don't remember what it does."
3126660,3128120," So, I'm going to use, like, GoLint."
3128120,3131660," I don't think VET is actually, like, found anything significant."
3131660,3134080," Um, okay."
3134080,3136700," So, this is going to be bin and let's do Lint."
3136700,3137000," Okay."
3137000,3138140," Lint seems to be fine."
3138140,3139400," Oh, we also have tests."
3139940,3142880," I didn't write any tests for it because I'm lazy."
3142880,3144460," Right."
3144460,3148560," So, let's just run the tests and see if we didn't break anything."
3148560,3150640," Apparently, we didn't break anything, which is nice."
3150640,3152780," I'm super happy that we didn't."
3152780,3157780," And let's just do the final build just to see if this entire thing builds."
3157780,3159320," Okay."
3159320,3163920," So, let's actually push that right into the repo and create a pull request."
3163920,3167300," Uh, to, to, to, to, where is this niche?"
3167300,3168760," Uh, right."
3168880,3170940," So, here is this niche."
3170940,3176440," So, compare and pull request, uh, urgency."
3176440,3179280," Um, so, what do we want to see?"
3179280,3182000," I'm, I'm, I think I'm going to actually do implement."
3182000,3188020," I'm going to use this commit, uh, commit as basically title and the body for this thing."
3188500,3191560," I wish I could easily do that for some reason image, not Emacs."
3191560,3194120," Um, GitHub does not allow me to easily do that."
3194120,3194860," Right."
3194860,3196880," So, I just want to be able to copy paste this thing."
3196880,3198360," I want to copy paste it in here."
3198360,3203260," Uh, why does not copy paste the like markdown?"
3203500,3204700," It's kind of lame, right?"
3204700,3210760," It supports the markdown in the titles, but when I copy the title, it doesn't copy the markdown with it."
3210760,3211960," Uh, right."
3211960,3216500," So, this is one of the things that I think Slack used to do and maybe Discord."
3216500,3220680," I don't remember if the Discord like does that, but this is one of the things that Slack does."
3221100,3221380," Right."
3221380,3225120," So, if you copy the message, but copies the markdown along with the message."
3225120,3229100," So, if you copy it in a different place in the Slack, it will have the same formatting, which is kind of cool."
3229100,3237680," So, and because of that, I can expect like all of these services that support markdown to support that as well, because it's rather convenient, I think."
3237680,3239180," Uh, all right."
3239180,3242280," So, and in here, I'm going to also put this thing up here."
3242280,3250080," InclinFix.me style urgency system for list sub command and let's create a pull request and see if we didn't break the continuous integration."
3250680,3260360," hopefully, uh, so we can also try to, um, try to see if, um, you know, the purge command still works."
3260360,3267400," It's kind of interesting, um, to, to, to, to, so where is the snitch lab?"
3267400,3268800," Where is the snitch lab?"
3268800,3277080," Uh, let me go ahead and just like, uh, mark all of that as closed."
3277080,3279680," Uh, huh."
3279980,3284720," Uh, and then I can say something like purge, right?"
3284720,3286760," So it recognized this entire thing."
3286760,3287240," Okay."
3287240,3291080," Uh, and it's removed all of them."
3291080,3291380," Okay."
3291380,3292220," That's perfect."
3292220,3296000," And if I go into the lab, uh, where is the lab?"
3296000,3296840," Here is the lab."
3296840,3304200," Uh, so it removed, and as you can see, since it supports the body, it also removes the body, right?"
3304200,3307260," So it knows where to remove things, which is, which is cool."
3307260,3309240," Uh, all right."
3309240,3311620," So here is the second, and okay."
3311620,3313140," So everything seems to be fine."
3313140,3315860," Uh, everything seems to be Gucci."
3316020,3320760," So, uh, and the continuous integration is happy."
3320760,3323820," So we're merging this pull request."
3323820,3324840," All right."
3324840,3328200," So the feature has been successfully stolen."
3328200,3330040," Right."
3330040,3331100," So that's it for today."
3331100,3333000," Thanks everyone who's watching me right now."
3333000,3334280," Uh, thank you so much."
3334280,3336700," The developer of fix me for such a great idea."
3336700,3339300," And I see you all next time."
3339300,3340680," See you all next time."
3340680,3344920," I don't know when that next time is going to be and on which platform is it going to be on YouTube."
3344920,3345700," Is it going to be on Twitch?"
3345700,3346220," I don't know."
3346220,3346600," We'll see."
3346600,3347000," We'll see."
3347000,3350000," Thanks everyone for watching. Love you all."
