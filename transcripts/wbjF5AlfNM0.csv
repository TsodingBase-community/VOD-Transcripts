880,6880," how are you doing today very good to see you today so today is friday and that means today"
6880,14240," according to the schedule we are doing a random that's right we're doing a random"
14240,20960," hello avon hawk uppercastic caustic xd uh shazovac malios dusty pausi arch uh here"
20960,29680," hurts and plots out nine mr bodka voiceless uh fax hello hello uh raspyfi hello welcome welcome"
29680,38240," really glad to you see you all uh today so today is random one of stream and the topic of today's"
38240,46720," random one of stream is time displacement who knows what the it is displacement who heard this"
46720,54960," kind of term who've seen this kind of term uh so this kind of term is usually applied to video effects"
54960,63520," so who saw videos with the time displacement effect let's google that let's google this is not how you"
63520,76480," google shit up uh so you can actually go to to youtube and put their time displacement time"
76480,82480," displacement and you'll find a ton of different videos that uh demonstrate you this kind of effect"
82480,86640," it's called it's also called slitscan i suppose um yeah"
90640,104640," so this is basically a demo"
115440,124240," a good idea so today i want to go ahead and implement this kind of effect myself algorithm"
124240,129440," so as far as i can understand this kind of effect is not that difficult to implement"
129440,136880," right it's not that difficult to implement uh so there was a video somewhere that explained that"
136880,143760," effect uh really well unfortunately i lost the link and i cannot find it but the idea is actually super simple"
143760,149040," uh let's actually open my paint"
149040,152400," it's actually open my opinion"
156400,163040," uh i want to implement that for research purposes so just i don't know i think it's kind of interesting"
163040,170160," to uh to quote that uh think algorithmically so i don't know maybe it's not interesting for everybody"
170160,177200," but it's interesting for me uh for sure so uh on one of these videos if some for sake i closed it"
178640,183840," if somebody can find that video that explains uh you know uh the"
183840,192400," the time displacement the way i just explain it right now feel free to post it in the in the chat"
192400,199440," all right so basically you have a frame right you have a frame of the video"
199440,201920," there we go"
204640,208000," and as a matter of fact you have several frames in the video"
208000,215520," obviously i mean in the video you have on the frames so imagine taking all of these frames and"
215520,218400," stacking them in a three-dimensional structure like that"
218400,229760," so here are all of the frames of your video this is actually pretty cool explanation i really like that"
230720,236080," so basically when you're watching the video you're basically moving uh you scan this third"
236080,242800," dimensional structure in this direction so this is basically time uh you have some sort of a plane"
242800,252080," right plane that scans that thing in that direction and just displays them like that"
253200,260560," so what if we experiment with that plane and actually orient it in different ways"
260560,269040," for example uh we could orient it slightly uh diagonally right uh something like this"
269040,279200," uh and it would intersect somewhere here right and it would scan not uh not"
281200,289760," how to say that not vertically but slightly diagonally so uh the low rows of the pixels will be slightly in"
289760,297520," the future than the uh the upper one you see because of this diagonal thingy um so the upper pixels"
297520,304080," are in the current time the lower are a little bit in the future the lower is further in the future and so"
304080,311120," so on and so forth so the the time is going to be uh from now to the future you can orient it a different way"
311120,319520," you can actually use um non flat surfaces for example you can do all sorts of different things and you will"
319520,327520," achieve different kind of results um upper sky and lower is a future cool but it's only one to orient you can"
327520,333360," orient it somehow differently um and yeah this is basically why i want you to implement that just to"
333360,339680," see how differently you can orient this kind of thing um yeah and what's interesting is that you'll"
339680,344240," have to hold the whole video in the memory to do this kind of thing and if you don't want to you'll have"
344240,352080," to implement some sort of a buffering that keeps only the used frame in the memory so it it has a lot of interesting things so"
352080,356960," yeah this is what this is what i wanted to do for today is that an interesting topic i think"
356960,363280," it's kind of it's kind of interesting topic so i think it's a i think it's a friday worthy topic that's"
363280,373120," what how this is how i would call it friday worthy topic uh all right before we fart i mean start uh let's"
373120,381520," uh make a cup of tea i suppose uh before because i cannot uh work without my cup of tea so and of course"
381520,385600," we're going to do that in rust because rust gives me views and i mean i don't really like that"
385600,389520," language that much but since people watch that language i'm okay with programming it as a matter"
389520,394320," of fact i'm okay with programming in any language it's just rust you know people watch rust for some"
394320,402880," reason i have no idea why okay so let's go to our organization our organization and create the"
402880,405440," repo for this particular project so how we're going to call it"
408320,414240," wouldn't some js thingy give more views i don't think it's easy to implement uh time displacements"
414240,422160," in js maybe i don't know i think i think rust in that sense a little bit more robust uh you also"
422160,429840," have to balance things between you know easy to use and uh views right i don't think it's going to be easy"
429840,436240," in njs uh because to to work with this kind of stuff with different mediums images and stuff like that you"
436240,440800," you will still have to have some sort of bindings and that means you're already working with two"
440800,446720," languages simultaneously and two languages simultaneously is all the friction so i already have enough"
447600,459200," problems with the rest so anyway uh let's call it uh time displacement"
459200,471120," there are more people watching or reading about rust than people actually using it oh so basically rust is"
471120,474800," like is like sex everybody's talking about it but nobody's doing it okay i see"
475600,483920," uh that that explains a lot actually okay time displacement uh in rust is is that"
483920,492400," is there does anybody know a better name i mean i don't know i think i think it's a better name"
492400,501280," it's a good name time displacement in rust of course trust displacement"
503520,507760," maybe we'll see so we're gonna call it like that maybe later we can come up with a better name"
507760,516320," maybe i i will initialize this repo so i'll add git ignore for a rust and maybe yeah i think it's it's"
516320,523040," okay and we're gonna add mit license see how easy this into in 2020 to create a github river"
524400,534320," you see in 1980 it was not that easy to create github repo because github didn't exist so obviously progress"
538160,542880," i love this argument i love this argument anyway so um"
542880,554080," time displacement and i'll probably have to initialize this shit anyway the right time and first"
554080,565200," yes uh cargo in it we're gonna initial oh my god for some reason in emacs in the compilation what you're not supposed to"
565680,570560," add ampersand otherwise it doesn't work for some reason like it just doesn't execute the command"
570560,579120," so cargo tunnel and there we go there we go and here our uh hello world application nice"
579120,590480," uh so we need a way to probably read images um i would not expect from rust to have any way to read videos"
591040,597840," at least any convenient way it probably has some some kind of like a weird broken ass package that was"
597840,605280," uh crafted by a student in their spare time and abandoned we're not doing that no i'm sorry we're"
605280,612000," not doing that uh we need something more robust and more stable so i'm probably gonna just use ff impact to"
612560,619040," take a video it into a sequence of images of png images and then i'm gonna read png images from rust"
619040,625680," because yeah i mean i i don't expect anything robust convenient and stable from rust to be fair"
625680,635440," uh so is there like leap png but in in in rust is there such a thing so there are some some sort of mappings"
636000,642800," so there's a lip png system which is unreliable bindings for lip png 1.6 love it"
642800,647840," so does it have any tags that we could have used"
651760,658880," it depends on cloud cloud flare zlib cloud flare zlib"
658880,669760," okay please use native rust png library instead okay so there's a native png library what wait a"
669760,678480," second it's like comes with the with this thing nice where can i take a look at the the the source code of"
678480,689680," this thing um so it's libre res the source code uh repository there's no way okay github okay it's"
689680,698720," it's called github uh is this oh it is alive two days ago chat look two days ago and it's completely"
698720,702960," written in rust apparently oh my god"
702960,712160," dusty pause it thank you so much for 100 beats thank you thank you and of course i'm gonna do it"
712160,718400," slightly uh unsafe than usual because i mean i'm not a big rust fan so i like to do things dangerously"
718400,721360," um i'm not afraid of pointers"
723920,729280," um thank you thank you so much for 100 beats uh thank you for supporting the channel so this is"
729280,735840," the show we're gonna use chat are you ready are you ready let's go"
735840,739600," load the pinch i have no idea what is load png"
739600,744080," cargo thermal boom"
746080,751200," uh cargo"
751200,754400," it's building it's updating crates io index"
754400,760080," load equal loud really"
760080,763200," i don't know"
763200,769120," i'm not ready could you give me i'm i'm i'm sorry we're already downloading the"
769120,774080," shit we're we're already compiling lip c it's it's late we're already deep into this"
774080,778640," shit so it does it already doesn't matter whether you're ready or not we're compiling"
778640,782960," we're compiling okay so you see we already compiled"
782960,791760," look it wasn't that painful it wasn't that painful just and we compile uh anyway so is there any examples"
791760,800240," that we i can use uh there uh so basically what you do you allocate some buffer"
800240,809360," what you also need rgb package what the fuck"
809360,816160," okay so it should be as easy as doing this shit right it should be as easy as doing this shit and on top"
816160,824880," of that uh we should return rust uh some sort of thingy here right and um also we'll have to return"
824880,831920," it like that so recently like somebody told me that to accommodate all of the possible errors that main"
831920,843360," can return you have to use box din error so result i'm sorry not trust result so this is to conveniently"
843360,849600," used main and to sort of unwrap all the errors this is the shit you have to return from main"
849600,859360," uh rust developers are you okay are you okay there that's like it's"
859360,870720," okay sure i mean i don't judge if you are into this kind of kinky i mean sure i mean this is just saying"
870720,875760," that it's not my thing but i mean if i have to do that i mean i'm okay all right so let's make a cup"
875760,878160," of tea i need a cup of tea chat i need a cup of tea"
878160,893440," so basically the idea here is that um you in the box you store a pointer to anything that implements"
893440,902080," error type class and they recently introduced like dean syntax that i don't remember uh from two or three"
902080,906240," years ago when i was programming in rest so it's probably a recent thing i don't know i'm a boomer"
906880,919760," um so let's make a cup of tea oh by the way thank you for reminding me archu sama uh we need to add this"
919760,925440," shit to the project command we need to add this shit to the project command so people will know where to find"
925440,936480," that shit update cmd project uh time displacement in thrust there we go so you can now find this"
936480,943200," shit here there's nothing there right now but we're gonna fill that repo with goodies and trust me"
947200,958880," how much is the bug of tea you're drinking all the time is it legal sure i mean"
958880,966880," it's just that the the tea itself comes with such a crappy packaging that i have to"
967520,973600," that this plastic bag is a better packaging that the the tea comes in that's why i have"
973600,979600," to put it somewhere like i wish i had some sort of like a can a tin can you know there are tin cans for"
979600,987120," for tea but i don't have it like that's the only thing i have and yeah and and that uh that tea like"
987120,993680," that package costs like three to five dollars per package so it's actually it's a regular tea it's just"
993680,1002320," in the crap package of course it's legal it's just it's just a regular tea come on see"
1002320,1009840," doesn't it look like a tea let me show you like it's a tea leaf you see it's a regular tea leaf"
1009840,1017280," maybe maybe i'm gonna actually go to full screen for everyone see can you focus please"
1019120,1025520," yes uh come on it's tea it's just a regular tea nothing special"
1025520,1043760," all right so let's refill the infuser infuser abuser"
1047360,1050800," is this what being on lsd feels like i have no idea no i've never tried lsd"
1050800,1056320," and i heard it's not recommended and in some countries it's even legal"
1056320,1067360," get this one uh sealed japanese container storage canister japanese that actually worries me a little"
1067360,1072080," bit so it might be is it something to us non-friendly does it have like tentacles or something"
1074240,1081120," um it doesn't open sorry it doesn't open on my side oh that's actually good nice"
1081120,1084960," that's a good one"
1084960,1088400," oh god damn it"
1088400,1098960," uh t sealed can japanese style looks good how much does it cost three bucks nice"
1101520,1108000," i don't use amazon sorry um okay so we need to boil up some water"
1108000,1115680," your leaves don't dry out well i put them in the container so they don't they already dry though"
1115680,1119920," oh it's it's chinese really oh i'm sorry"
1122640,1136000," uh oops um so i don't know neither japanese nor chinese so it's kind of difficult for me to distinguish"
1136000,1142960," them um i'm pretty sure an american wouldn't distinguish russian and ukrainian or something"
1145200,1156320," so um is amazon as big in russia no it's actually not i'm pretty sure 99 of people in russia don't use"
1156320,1163600," amazon like at all by the way russians in the chat do you use amazon like does anybody use amazon in russia"
1163600,1173120," i don't think so like nobody uses uh we have our own like local things no yeah nobody uses amazon russia"
1173120,1180560," exactly it's not as i wouldn't even say it's as big as everywhere else it doesn't exist pretty much"
1183040,1194640," uh okay but maybe somebody uses i don't know i never use their services uh except aws and even that"
1194640,1200240," shit was crappy as fuck um anyway so this is how we load this thing but we need some sort of an image"
1200240,1208480," that we can load up so i think i do in fact know the image that i want to load up jesus christ what the"
1208480,1217120," hell is going on is that a donation i can i can see uh oh yeah it's a donation one dollar donation uh"
1217120,1228640," after this code it's in haskell uh thank you for one dollar haskell is on thursdays yeah well technically"
1228640,1235200," after uh this code uh we will have haskell but on thursday on the next week's thursday thank you so much"
1235200,1242800," for one dollar thank you for supporting the channel really appreciate that um all right so let's uh find"
1242800,1252880," the image that we want to load up um it feels so this is going to be the image that we're going to load"
1252880,1261760," up uh wget so let's download that shit super quick super quick so this is the image that we will try to"
1261760,1272960," load up it's a pretty good image uh let's rename it to fields and go there so is there any way i can"
1272960,1282800," actually verify that i loaded that shit up uh for example i need documentation is there any api references"
1282800,1293120," would you look at that shit api references so when i decode file decode 32 file right you got 32 file"
1293120,1301280," wovatex subscribed to tier one they've been subscribed for five months thank you so much my god thank you"
1301280,1308960," thank you thank you thank you thank you and uh welcome back to our epic rust club mine got absolutely"
1308960,1320800," fucking epic um thank you so this thing returns bitmap rgba so what is a bitmap and why is it is this a"
1320800,1328160," container uh so it has a width and height this is exactly what i wanted to do um print ln width"
1329840,1338800," so image width and here we're gonna do height there we go isn't that epic chat i think it's pretty"
1338800,1345120," much flipping epic and now if i rebuild this entire shit i think i have to actually move this thing here"
1345120,1355680," somewhere so cargo let's let's run it straight up uh me yes it doesn't compile shut look it does not"
1355680,1363680," not compile probably because i have to use std error error error error and on top of that i'll probably"
1363680,1370400," have to use slot png something something i don't know we'll see we'll see we'll see we'll see it actually"
1370400,1375440," loaded the image up it says the size of the image and what's the actual size of the image let's find out"
1376640,1388720," um it is in fact that two 287 and uh the height is 282 yes we loaded that shit correctly isn't that epic"
1388720,1395200," isn't that epic i think it's pretty much flipping epic so um then we have a buffer which is a vector"
1395200,1401520," of pixels and then you have a pixel type and the pixel type that we actually actually using there is rgb"
1402240,1412800," uh yes what is rgb rgb is just um rgb 8 why does it only take two uh two parameters this is actually very"
1412800,1424320," interesting why why does it uh take only two type parameters uh okay so oh it has a separate type for"
1424320,1432480," alpha channel wow why okay"
1432480,1446240," cool razz developers likes to like to be as abstract as possible yeah it's kind of like a it's a new way"
1446240,1454560," new way of doing spring and shit like that and by spring i mean java framework um all right so and"
1454560,1464160," basically uh i can just access the um um how to say that the the the individual pixels let's try to"
1464160,1472160," uh transform that image somehow um and after transformation is it even possible for me uh to"
1472160,1478160," save that file there should be something like encode 32 file right yeah there is a such thing as encode 32"
1478160,1486320," file general soak subscribe with twitch prime for three months thank you thank you so much and welcome"
1486320,1494320," to our epic rust club ah we big fans of rust am i right hello hello thank you so much so this is how"
1494320,1498320," we encode this right and what's funny is that instead of providing the beatmap"
1498320,1509360," don't you notice something weird here okay don't you don't you don't you do something weird"
1509360,1516800," like um okay let's take a look at the decode 32 file"
1519200,1523680," decode 32 so and i'm gonna put it in separate um"
1523680,1531920," in a separate window and uh then let's take a look at encode 32 file"
1531920,1544640," so let's actually compare them side by side look at the signatures of these things"
1546000,1555680," look at them there's something weird like this thing returns bitmap so obviously decode 32 and"
1555680,1560480," encode 32 are opposite operations of each other right it's all like like encode is a reverse"
1560480,1565600," function of decode and decode is a reverse function of encode it's understandable like this one returns"
1565600,1577280," bitmap which is simply a structure that has pixels width and height so i would expect encode to also take"
1577280,1580560," bitmap but no it takes image and width and height"
1580560,1587520," and bitmap is basically structure of image and width and height so why did you do this separation"
1588400,1592400," um i mean i don't mind it's just slightly weird"
1592400,1602800," um i do this kind of only in in my code when it's not finished when i'm just experimenting but this is"
1602800,1608640," a production ready library it's supposed to be i don't know is there an overall no no no there's no"
1608640,1614160," overloading in rust as far as i know you cannot overload functions in rust seriously i'm not even joking"
1614160,1619600," like it's just not a thing in rust like you if you if you think you can define something like this"
1619600,1624400," um i32 i suppose println"
1624400,1634960," x and you think you can copy paste this stuff and for example accept um i34 and if you try to compile that"
1634960,1642640," shit you're wrong it will say previous definition of a value f here it just does not overload"
1642640,1648640," don't ask questions you're just library oh i forgot i keep forgetting about that thank you thank you"
1648640,1651760," online for reminding me yes yes yes and thank you"
1658240,1664400," husky developers didn't teach razz developers about isomorphism probably um maybe there is some kind"
1664400,1668560," of reason why it was convenient like that i don't know i think it's just doesn't really matter that much"
1668560,1675440," so the thing i want to do chat i want to try to invert um that bitmap maybe rotate"
1678640,1692640," 90 degrees or something maybe transpose so how you can just transport it um you can basically start"
1692640,1697520," uh well yeah"
1700080,1709280," you can start iterating rows from two sides and for each rows you iterate columns and swap pixels and"
1709280,1715920," that will uh actually let you rotate it in place right so the reason why i'm doing all of that is"
1715920,1720640," because i want to actually you know get the gist of the of the technology that i will have to work with"
1722480,1728320," uh yeah that's why i'm doing that rotate image so we're going to accept image which is basically a"
1728320,1740720," bitmap of rgb's rgbas and i suppose it has to be immutable immutable reference so and this is how you"
1740720,1747920," know the phone is kicking in so how we'll be able to actually pass a mutable image there well i suppose"
1747920,1754480," we'll have to first mark this thing as mutable so we'll have a mutable reference there then we'll try"
1754480,1761520," to rotate an image uh by doing something like that right we pass it by a mutable reference uh so i'm"
1761520,1768320," doing a very dangerous borrow checker shit right it may not even work at the end of the day but we'll see"
1768320,1775600," we'll see then we're it gets a mother flippanty and after that i want to encode uh file in code 32 file i"
1775600,1784720," suppose uh i think i lost my shirt somewhere yeah okay so i have to do encode"
1784720,1791040," file encode file 32"
1797040,1809680," so we'll have to provide the file path um load png encode 32 file uh output png so and for the data"
1809680,1818080," we're going to use image i already forgot what was the data does anybody remember what was there does"
1818080,1823840," anybody remember okay let me try to do this thing i should actually keep all these things opens all the"
1823840,1832320," time uh so there was a bitmap i forgot i just forgot the the name of the field uh buffer so it's a buffer i'll"
1832320,1839200," have to pass it by a pointer i would assume that i can pass it by just a read on the pointer because i'm"
1839200,1846480," not uh like saving that is not going to modify that thing obviously so it doesn't really matter uh not"
1846480,1853360," high and not here but height okay so um i think i can even you know make it like that all right so"
1853360,1858880," hopefully this thing will do something obviously this thing doesn't do anything yet but our goal is to"
1858880,1864880," just make it compilable and see how deeply the borrow charity is going to focus in the ads that's that's the"
1864880,1871200," that's the goal for for right now at least uh okay so it's uh not that deep enough and this is not even"
1871200,1880320," a borrow checker so the thing we'll have to do we'll have to use load uh png bitmap and another interesting"
1880320,1887840," thing is that rgba i'm not really sure yeah yeah so this is rgba there we go uh all right so we have a"
1887840,1895920," warnings uh warning and it compiled chat it compiled isn't that beautiful so i won borrow checker"
1895920,1904640," absolutely epic uh would you share the rough area in which you're living just interesting i find russia"
1904640,1911360," rather interesting well my the rough area where i'm living is actually not a secret if you go to my"
1912480,1919520," github profile page if you explore my social media links that i put in the panels you will quickly"
1919520,1924800," find that i live in novosibirsk which is the capital of siberia and siberia is a region"
1924800,1931040," in the middle of russia somewhere around asian part of russia it's never it was never secret like"
1931040,1937520," majority of people sitting here actually know that uh you're welcome okay"
1942240,1953440," so um rotate image okay so if i run this it will simply copy fields png file right uh"
1953440,1961680," it's running why are you running why are you running really"
1961680,1967040," why did it take so much time to do that"
1970320,1975120," what release i want to run it one more time"
1975120,1989200," this is insanity what the is going on what what why does it take so much time to copy a file"
1993280,2002080," okay uh if i call that thing directly um okay i'm calling calling this executable directly this is"
2002080,2004160," how much oh my god"
2004160,2011920," okay let's compile that in release mode"
2017680,2030560," i'm shocked"
2030560,2030560," i'm shocked"
2030560,2031280," it wraps every pixel in the box i have no idea what the is going on this is embarrassing"
2031280,2035200," it's not even compilation process right it's just"
2035200,2041680," all right well in release what the is going on in the debug mode"
2041680,2043920," oh yeah"
2043920,2048480," and it's not even that fast"
2052640,2055760," oh i mean i'm sorry i'm using debug again"
2055760,2060960," could you please give me it's still going"
2060960,2065520," i mean it's not even that fast"
2065520,2069600," i'm pretty sure leap png would be faster"
2069600,2072880," like directly in c"
2075520,2078480," i mean even for release this is kind of slow like"
2078480,2082800," how do you say that"
2082800,2091120," i recently was developing zozin uh like off screen oh there's like a json library"
2091120,2096320," there's a json library that i'm developing i've been developing on a stream and then i"
2096320,2107760," continue developing it on on uh like offline this thing parses 10 million elements of the race"
2107760,2110880," less than 100 milliseconds"
2110880,2116160," okay json maybe is not comparable to png but we're talking about an image"
2116160,2119600," of this size"
2125120,2128320," i have no idea what the is going on seriously i'm disappointed"
2128320,2133120," um"
2133120,2140000," how are you supposed to write in this language maybe there's something wrong with this"
2140000,2144080," library maybe this library is very unoptimal that could be the thing um"
2150000,2156720," okay okay so we found that library in lip png uh crate right in the png crate"
2156720,2160240," uh"
2160240,2172800," lip png so i got this thing right lip png and this particular library says don't use lip png sys use"
2172800,2174160," this load png to"
2174160,2181680," bundle sleep png as a fallback please check whether this version is still secure before"
2181680,2185920," using this package yeah lip png is actually famous for being super insecure for some reason"
2185920,2192400," like it has ton of vulnerabilities um okay rust lip png"
2193440,2196160," kronosky and reliable bindings and png"
2196160,2208000," i want to do an experiment like a very simple experiment where i just use lip png"
2208000,2219680," um png injection yes yes exactly uh lip png i also need to like i know that new people will come in and"
2219680,2223440," will start complaining what the are you doing the title says rust where's my rust"
2223440,2230640," so i'm going to open a little bit of rust here at the bottom so the new people who come in will"
2230640,2236480," think that we're like doing rust like here here's the rust uh here is the rest so there is a png"
2236480,2242240," thingy you have png crates what the is png"
2243600,2250880," um okay cool uh why didn't it show up here is this because i didn't google png"
2250880,2256560," okay so i should have i should have actually searched for png i actually searched for lip png"
2256560,2263840," and i brought that thing from on myself uh but that's besides the point it's actually super surprising how"
2263840,2273600," slow that shed is um and what's funny is that low png is actually actively support support it um but yeah"
2273600,2277840," okay"
2277840,2285760," png i think this is how we do that i don't quite remember i think i'll have to copy paste some code"
2286480,2295680," from something or something something or something uh png this is how we do that oh god damn it i i lost"
2295680,2299280," my my link there uh-huh"
2299280,2310960," main rust okay so i need to find some of the shit how do i load um sprites"
2312480,2319440," load png as a surface okay so this is basically what you do to read that shit"
2319440,2326480," appropriately right so we're going to adapt it a little bit so you allocate png image on the stack"
2326480,2333200," you zero initialize it and you assign a png version on it then you invoke png image begin read"
2333200,2340240," from file and that reads meta information to the file then you can say that you couldn't read that thing"
2341280,2355840," fprintf std error png pooped itself right something like that um so then you assign whatever format you wanna"
2355840,2361760," put it there and then you allocate enough memory to"
2361760,2370320," uh-huh to fit the whole thing we're gonna allocate it into into the image pixels"
2370960,2389040," uh then um i'll probably need to include std int dot h uh and then we simply continue reading this"
2389040,2400640," entire thing and if it doesn't read uh we abort the entire operation so probably have to include std lib std io"
2400640,2408800," and so on and so on and so forth there we go so of course it's not as easy as decode 32 file but you"
2408800,2414640," know you can also wrap this entire thing into a single file of single function and call it decode 32 file"
2414640,2420960," doesn't really matter that much image file name could be um const char"
2420960,2428560," right it's all about uh abstractions right because obviously all the heavy lifting is abstracted away here we"
2428560,2433920," we do not abstract away all the heavy lifting uh well because uh lip png actually gives you a lot"
2433920,2440560," of control over what you're trying to do um now so let's actually see if this compiles or not uh i will"
2440560,2446720," try to do something like this main c um i'm gonna enable some of the warnings just in case to you know"
2446720,2455040," double check that i didn't up um i also have to add something like package config c flags png i think maybe"
2455040,2461440," it's sleep png i'm not quite sure i need to double check that chat uh package config libs png i think"
2461440,2467120," this is how we do that note it's not lip png it's uh it's not png it's sleep png okay i see"
2467680,2480720," uh now let's quickly try to do that just see wall package config c flags png libs png i already double"
2480720,2485840," checked that i'm sorry i quickly forget what i'm doing so there's some some kind of a problem with my"
2485840,2494640," hat uh libs png yeah there we go okay it doesn't compile because we don't have a mem set because it's"
2494640,2502560," located in some sort of a string whatever and uh malloc we don't have a malloc too many arguments"
2502560,2507120," for the malloc yeah this is basically what you have to do you have to multiply those things together and"
2507120,2514880," multiply it by the size of u int 32 underscore t and uh next thing you have to use null null here and there"
2514880,2522000," you go there you go and null here as well all right cool so now we need to save that entire thing"
2522000,2529360," i stumbled on load by accident switching now yes it's kind of slow library"
2529360,2536640," oh he's switching so you're talking about me probably so i just want to i just want to compare"
2536640,2542160," the performance of lip png with load png nothing nothing else that's what i want to do like just"
2542160,2548400," just for just out of curiosity just pure out of scientific curiosity nothing special i'm really sorry"
2548400,2554880," like but i'm super interesting uh super interested i've no idea how to dump images in in png image i'm"
2554880,2563760," not even sure if i remember doing that at some point uh we did do that in vodos"
2563760,2572720," yes we did do that in vodos and i'm not even sure if i did not remove that from vodos let's actually"
2572720,2584000," take a look at that so um so there's the image 32 and png yes i'm super glad yeah it's actually way"
2584000,2592480," easier than i thought this is how we do that this is how we do that yeah so i already have a png image"
2592480,2598240," right we already have a png image uh i'm i could have just used the same structure by the way i could"
2598240,2603200," have just used the same structure but i'm going to allocate another structure uh just for you chat"
2603200,2611840," just for you uh png png image image image format and then i just save image pixels to the file name and"
2611840,2616880," we're going to use like output output file name and the output um"
2616880,2627760," output file name is going to be output png so what we're doing right what we're doing chat"
2628480,2631920," we're simply reading in image and writing it back we're simply reading in image and writing it back"
2631920,2639120," reading it and writing it back nothing special absolutely nothing fucking special"
2639120,2646160," okay square replace p image output"
2646160,2658000," cool now chat look uh let's let's confirm that this entire shit even works right you have fields png"
2658240,2665840," you have output png we remove it we run main which is c library which is c code and it actually creates"
2665840,2670560," that thing again look how fast it's doing that"
2674720,2676480," so this is c"
2676480,2686640," and what is load png release mind you release"
2686640,2689680," target"
2689680,2696560," release time displacement the same operation"
2700960,2701600," release"
2701600,2701680," release"
2701680,2704320," fucking release"
2704320,2708880," okay so uh load png we're not using that"
2708880,2713040," there is a png crate let's take a look at the png crate maybe it's faster"
2713040,2713840," okay"
2713840,2715840," all right"
2715840,2722560," i'm not even doing anything i'm just loading it up decoding it and then encoding it back"
2724800,2731520," rust killed c by the way yeah exactly it's it's dead rust yes he's dead um anyway"
2731520,2735120," x looks not too bad for safe"
2735120,2741760," probably i mean you have to compile it with release though but during development during the bug phase"
2741760,2745200," you're gonna have trouble because you'll have to wait a lot but i don't know"
2745200,2751760," why is that so slow i feel like in this particular situation is not the rust that is slow"
2752560,2759360," it might be a library or maybe it might be i made some sort of like uh like i shoot my leg with this"
2759360,2766800," library and use some sort of like slow version that copies a lot but again why library is designed in"
2766800,2772400," so way that it's so easy to shoot your leg i don't think this is necessarily a problem with rust by the"
2772400,2778720," way i think it's something with the library it's either the library implementation or library usability"
2779360,2784800," this is not rust uh this is not a problem with rust uh let's take a look at the png crate uh png crate"
2784800,2789600," might be a little bit better in that particular situation so um okay"
2789600,2797680," so we're getting rid of this how do i include that so i have to use this thing"
2798640,2808160," all right png equal what 0 16 uh three okay so how do you use that um"
2808160,2814800," shit's gone this shit's gone bye-bye bye-bye uh so"
2814800,2823440," uh well the interface is with more cucumbersome but i mean if it's if it's better if it's better i should"
2823440,2829360," have probably save this example you know what i think i should save it um maybe in the future i"
2829360,2830880," will want to compare it somehow"
2830880,2840880," yeah let's save it uh okay load png main right so i'm going to keep it in a separate file just in case if"
2840880,2845440," i want to go back and compare it with something so we're not going to murder it yet we're not going to"
2845440,2856400," murder it yet so let's do results nothing uh box uh dean uh error and then we're gonna return okie dokie"
2856400,2865200," karaoke so what do we need we need uh stdfs um i think i want to split my screen just to see what the"
2865200,2875760," fuck is going on mate all right so we're creating a png decoder decoder uh new file open uh we open"
2875760,2879120," fields png and really"
2879120,2892160," come on it's 2020. um all right so then we do mute reader oh i really like the fact that you can actually"
2892160,2897040," powder match these things like so so this one is going to be read only but this one is going to"
2897040,2903040," mutable so you can sort of yeah it's kind of cool uh that you have this syntactical sugar for this kind"
2903040,2914400," of stuff uh decoder you unwrap it like so and then i suppose you allocate the buffer uh so we open decoder"
2914400,2922480," you get information about the decoder you allocate required amount of memory to store this entire thing"
2922480,2928480," on this stack by the way i suppose if i understand correctly does this chat allocate it on the stack"
2928480,2934400," there's a shit allocated on the stack so what if the image actually is super"
2934400,2939040," fucking big and it's not gonna fit into the stack it's not allocated on the stack so vec is actually"
2939040,2946880," allocated on the heap um it's kind of interesting how do you do i can't do you even control that then"
2946880,2954400," uh you forgot creating the decoder oh yeah it doesn't matter the compiler will tell me uh okay info buffer"
2954400,2963120," size okay it's kind of interesting like this is allocating it on the heap but how for example i can"
2963120,2971840," tell something to allocate it on the stack this is kind of weird but i mean sure okay it's a macro to"
2971840,2978800," create vec oh so basically underneath underneath it's underneath it's doing new vec new which allocates"
2978800,2982960," all that on the on the heap right do i understand correctly i think i think i understand that correct"
2982960,2993680," sure um next frame and read the next frame currently currently this function should be on the con twice ah"
2993680,3002640," basically this is like an interface for reading apngs yeah do you guys know about apngs"
3008800,3015040," so basically and it doesn't work correctly in majority of the situations by the way um"
3015040,3024560," so if you in the future when there will be support for apng anytime soon yeah uh you'll have to call"
3024560,3030800," this thing several times to to get all of the frames yeah yeah sure it's like uh apng is gonna kill gif"
3030800,3039920," when linux will kill uh windows on the desktop that's for sure um all right so anytime soon anytime soon"
3039920,3051120," uh reader uh next frame and i just pass uh that buffer there and uh i just unwrap it i suppose i'll have"
3051120,3057040," to save that somewhere let's save it to the frame and uh i'll have to create the the decoder"
3058400,3064160," i have to create the decor and this is basically what we do to achieve the epic victory royal and"
3064160,3070880," that's for sure um all right so let's try to compile that uh thing and see if it if it combines or not"
3070880,3078000," uh not make cargo build cargo build let's say that"
3080640,3089840," when rust will kill c yeah sure jesus christ mate is it how really okay it's it was not that many"
3089840,3093680," dependencies i was actually scared that it's gonna download like a ton of dependencies okay it's not"
3093680,3100160," that many all right it actually spooked me a little bit because you can expect this kind of"
3100160,3105280," from the from the arrest crate you you can like this is basically what you have to expect all the time"
3106240,3118000," um jsptsd exactly i'm having jsptsd okay so let's see how maybe it's not really great to compare it"
3118000,3126400," like that so i think we should right away try to save that file back um so what we'll have to have we'll"
3126400,3132000," have to have path um so what's funny is that when you create a file here"
3132000,3141120," okay so let's do the saving routine so this is where we load this entire shot all right load"
3143920,3161440," and um then we're gonna save there we go uh ref mute okay ref mute sure i have no idea why but if"
3161440,3166720," you want to do ref mute sure um file create"
3169360,3174560," um i'll put png and of course we'll have to probably unwrap this entire thing"
3174560,3188960," okay uh now we need to create encoder um encoder png encoder new um this thing with ah this one is"
3188960,3195840," actually interesting so we'll have to do in four uh can you do width and height of out of this info is"
3195840,3203760," that even a thing is that even a thing that i can do um i'm not quite sure i'll probably have to look"
3203760,3211840," up the documentation of this entire thing okay uh let me go do that so i'm going to duplicate this thing"
3211840,3219680," um reading form what does reading for return it returns it doesn't even show what it returns here"
3219680,3226240," unfortunately it returns output info does output info contains with would you look at that beautiful"
3226240,3231840," it does contain width and height and they are not even functions they're straight up members so i can"
3231840,3238160," just even call them like that absolutely beautiful thank you my god finally a usable interface that just"
3238160,3244080," gives me width in height i'm unbelievable um all right all right all right all right so this is what we do"
3244080,3251360," then we go to the encoder and we set the color is going to be png color type rgba and then we're going"
3251360,3259280," to set depth how deep we're going to penetrate the color uh i suppose we want to go bit depth"
3262400,3278400," fucking eight did you did you guys know that there is like"
3283120,3295600," okay okay sure constant literally called eight"
3295600,3311040," okay right there in color right header um okay so this is and then we use the data array"
3312880,3325200," um rider right image data and uh what data we have to use chat by the way so here's the data i suppose"
3325200,3332000," we can just shove the frame into that i hope and hopefully that will just work probably not"
3332000,3338800," probably it won't work um probably it won't work so overall it doesn't really look that bad"
3339840,3345600," so it's a little bit more cucumbersome than this i do agree with that but if this is faster"
3345600,3351760," it will be actually pretty cool unfortunately i already removed my c program god damn it like i keep"
3351760,3357520," removing shit that is actually important uh there's something wrong with me for sure let's build that"
3357520,3364160," shit okay so we've got buff writer so buff writer requires probably additional stuff here so let's quickly"
3364160,3373920," let's quickly do that so it's in io what do we got what do we get and uh yeah expected slice int found"
3373920,3381120," oh okay so it doesn't really save that into a frame oh yeah there we go so i have to use buffer here"
3381120,3389920," instead i see my god it actually worked i don't quite understand why do i need frame here like it's really like"
3389920,3397200," like why it's not needed okay so here we do we in decode it we load it we load it up and then we"
3397200,3401920," instantly encode it and save it back so this is basically what we're doing we're doing a very simple"
3401920,3409360," exercise super simple exercise nothing special uh now let's try to run it and see how fast it runs"
3409360,3415920," and format wrong data size expected uh this kind of thing but got at which point it failed that's kind of"
3415920,3421360," interesting"
3421360,3426720," so it throws some sort of some sort of error but the problem with this kind of shit is that i have"
3426720,3432160," no idea where exactly that happened i have no idea where exactly that happened is this because"
3432160,3442640," uh i'm not using rub if i used unwrap instead of all of these question marks would that thing would"
3442640,3449120," that unwrap tell me the place the exact place uh where the shit went down"
3449120,3455520," because this is kind of unhelpful if you look at that it's kind of unhelpful because i don't really"
3455520,3460720," know where exactly that happens so let's try to recompile it and run one more time"
3461280,3469120," uh okay so error isn't is unused sure uh and some of the other things are are unused here as well okay so"
3470240,3478720," yeah it would be more helpful interesting just unwrapping like that is more helpful"
3478720,3482240," than using question mark"
3486480,3494880," interesting is it not i think it's pretty interesting all right i think the image doesn't"
3494880,3500320," have alpha okay so we can try to do something like that well first i want to see where exactly the"
3500320,3510240," shit went down um okay so yeah the shit went down somewhere here and uh somebody suggested in the chat"
3510240,3513920," that maybe the image doesn't have alpha in this particular situation we probably have to do something"
3513920,3522240," like this right uh let's give it a try and it worked thank you so much uh yeah"
3522240,3527120," thank you thank you so much for for for your suggestion"
3533200,3538480," because this is why term thingy from yesterday kept using unwrapped i suppose yeah i guess more"
3538480,3544480," experienced trust developers actually aware of this fact because they probably were burned so many"
3544480,3551600," times by the question marks uh and that's why they keep using unwrap because basically unwrap gives you"
3551600,3558400," more information on of about the place where that should happen because i suppose yeah that's very"
3558400,3565920," interesting when you return on wrap and when you return an error right an error error does not retain"
3565920,3571280," the place where that problem happened like in for example in java right in java when you throw an"
3571280,3577200," exception exception at least carries the place where that exception happens so if you try to print"
3577200,3582160," information about exception in a different place you can restore that place but here you cannot"
3584000,3589520," you just error does not retain the place so for you to actually get the place where that happened is to"
3589520,3597440," actually panic at that place interesting interesting very interesting i'm learning things i'm learning"
3597440,3607760," things about rust which make me uh want to use rust less anyway so let's continue let's continue chat let's"
3607760,3613760," see how fast that is let's first confirm that it worked as far as i can see it already worked so"
3613760,3622640," everything seems to be okay uh let's go to debug information time displacement and uh yeah it seems to"
3622640,3632000," be twerking so i'm gonna i'm gonna execute this uh thing directly and look how much time it will take"
3632000,3643680," it's it's a debug mode okay it's slower than c version but it's a debug mode debug what's going to happen"
3643680,3649120," happen with a release mode"
3649120,3652560," debug mode doesn't understand oh we'll have to recombine some of these things in release mode"
3652560,3654560," um"
3654560,3669520," okay so now if i try to run uh target release time displacement"
3669520,3673520," now we're talking"
3673520,3677360," wait a second i think this is faster than c"
3677360,3686000," i think this is god damn it i removed the c example chat i removed the c example uh wait wait wait wait"
3686000,3696640," no i didn't this is beautiful yes now we're talking now we're faster finally we we killed c"
3699280,3707360," we killed c yes so rust is faster than c there we go that's what i'm talking about"
3712160,3716560," but to be fair i didn't compile my program with o3 so maybe i mean yeah"
3716560,3727920," um okay epic so that means uh we're going to use this crate instead sure i'm super happy with that"
3727920,3732560," so i'm going to remove load png and uh yeah so we're going to use this instead"
3733680,3739760," thank you so much for suggesting this thing all right all right and from now on i'm going to use"
3739760,3744320," unwraps because i learned that unwraps actually give you information about the place where uh the"
3744320,3748160," shed goes down so the thing i want to do chat now i want to be able to"
3750880,3758960," um revert the image right so back to the original exercise that i wanted to do back to the original"
3758960,3765680," exercise so i'm going to take uh i'm going to create a function rotate image which is going to"
3765680,3773520," accept i suppose um u8 but i'm not quite sure like i have to accept the buffer i think i'll have to"
3773520,3778480," accept it as u8 but is it going to be really u8 because i want to work on on a level of individual"
3778480,3786080," pixels and i know that individual pixels for me is around 32 but it might not be the case"
3786080,3794320," you know what's interesting you know what's interesting"
3794320,3806880," in leap png i could specify the end format that i want so apparently this particular thing"
3808480,3815120," gives you pixels in whatever format they are in the file right so it doesn't even try to you know"
3815120,3821280," convert them to anything or whatever so if there's um rgb and you want rgba um"
3821280,3826000," no it's going to give you rgb so we probably have to do some extra work here"
3826000,3835200," and be but see example was actually designed it so that it converts whatever is in the file"
3835840,3843280," to rgba right this example probably doesn't do this conversion that's why it's faster"
3843280,3850080," this is not a fair comparison we didn't kill c we didn't kill c because c actually did more than this"
3850080,3857120," it legit did more on top of reading the beats just reading the beats it also converted them into rgba"
3858720,3865520," sorry chat yeah we didn't kill c we didn't kill c uh this is not this was not fair comparison we'll have"
3865520,3871440," to continue you know working on that so the thing we'll have to do probably is to"
3871440,3881200," maybe specify the format that we want somehow uh maybe it's done somewhere on the level of decoder i suppose"
3885120,3893520," so we can do new decoder new limits uh set limits and so on and so forth read all metadata until the first"
3893520,3900800," i data blah blah blah because this is really not convenient to define"
3900800,3907120," decoder reading form okay so okay damn it"
3909600,3917440," maybe the library has some generic pixel type maybe um maybe maybe maybe so let's try to find what kind"
3917440,3923680," of we can do so set limits there should be where's the reading for here here's the reading for and"
3923680,3930240," there's no way uh for me oh you can set transformation is a pre-processing in the raw image data modifying"
3930240,3939440," content or encoding many options have impact on memory ah transformations strip 16 strip alpha expand"
3939600,3948160," shift swap alpha uh okay can i convert to a specific format though"
3948160,3958240," um you can set transformation to boolean so in here are all the transformations"
3958240,3967760," flip rgb to bgbgra invert monopack strip alpha but i want to add alpha actually"
3968000,3973200," invert alpha this is kind of interesting like"
3973200,3980960," lip png is way more convenient because you can say i want my pixels in that format whatever the format in"
3980960,3987600," the file i don't care do your job and convert whatever the in the file into my format this is"
3987600,3992720," what you can do with lip png without even thinking about what's in the file this is called abstraction"
3993520,3998880," right so which is super convenient well i mean you have less control of what the is going on"
3998880,4006480," on the cpu right but at least it's convenient for prototyping and shit um here no no idea it's"
4006480,4009360," kind of weird bro bro bro bro it's kind of weird"
4011360,4017520," uh from bits uh convert from underlying bit representation unless that representation contains"
4017520,4023920," bits that do not correspond to the flag this one sounds very interesting so convert from underlying"
4023920,4030800," bit representation unless and i've no idea how to use that like i've there's no not a single example on how"
4030800,4038400," to use that i have no idea how to use that uh the only examples we have here is how to use decoder and"
4038400,4046400," how to use encoder without too much stuff what's interesting is that you see you can set color"
4046400,4053040," wait a second can i do the same shit for decoder that wish that would be a thing like i want to do"
4053040,4058800," something like um set color like a similar thing but for decoder"
4058800,4064480," no because it kind of makes sense doesn't it"
4064480,4070160," like yeah so set color set depth this is this is the shit i want"
4070160,4078240," um and maybe it makes sense for me to do that like here right here yeah let's give it a try"
4081440,4089440," smexy font uh fantastic sense uh uh that that sounds"
4089440,4099040," i'm disappointed i was expecting a sense from undertale"
4099040,4110640," maybe it's good for somebody but i expected more and i was also expecting that when i opened this page"
4110640,4119360," megalovania starts to play in or something um anyway let's build this shit okay so an expected"
4119360,4126560," token yeah i i understand you so we don't use a right buffer and you cannot method not phone"
4126560,4129920," decoder yeah you cannot set color you can't set code"
4140080,4148240," maybe there's something in the reader maybe it's it makes me sad it makes me sad it's kind of sad"
4148240,4151680," next frame next role"
4151680,4155280," output color tag"
4155280,4157520," put buffer size"
4157520,4166160," this doesn't give you so yeah you have to you have to do that yourself or maybe on the level of"
4166160,4167280," transformations and stuff"
4167280,4180160," okay so whatever when i do next frame um i get the buffer of these things um and yeah"
4180160,4186640," this is like actually kind of limiting uh thingy called i describe the layout of the samples in the pixel"
4188480,4196080," grayscale rgb rgb rgb samples from u8 temporary search until rust provides a canonical one"
4196080,4204400," really what"
4212480,4217520," did i open the window already i think i want to go open the window and uh while opening the window"
4217520,4221760," maybe anybody have has any any questions or something"
4225440,4227200," yeah the window is closed"
4227200,4233280," window is motherfucking closed"
4233280,4244000," so what is time displacement uh i think we need to update our um"
4244000,4250160," our project command to explain people what the is time displacement"
4251840,4258880," uh my my keyboard has died by the way uh something with my cable probably something with my cable"
4258880,4264880," oh there we go um all right so maybe i have to replace the cable because it's keep dying on me"
4264880,4271920," it's keep dying on me uh time displacement uh yeah there we go so"
4273520,4280640," yeah this is the thing this is the time displacement uh so i think we need to update the"
4280640,4284160," project command"
4284160,4295440," that cmd uh let's take a look at the project first all right so we're gonna do type display displacement"
4297120,4307440," uh i need to craft something like this type displacement in rust"
4307440,4315680," so let's do the following way i think it's gonna be better"
4315680,4321440," so i'm gonna put a dash a long dash here you see how long that dash is"
4323040,4328560," it's time you place that keyboard all the makings are already rubbed off all the markings"
4328560,4331680," oh yeah i see i see what you're saying"
4331680,4337040," i actually bought it like that so it was already rubbed off"
4337040,4346080," all right and uh now source code is gonna be somewhere"
4350240,4360640," here here there we go and then let's go back to update cmd project boom there we go epic isn't"
4360640,4367840," that epic i think it's pretty much so now we have source code we have an example we're good to go"
4367840,4369840," does anybody have any other questions"
4369840,4372000," uh"
4375520,4383120," so then i miss your haskell code uh which month uh if you didn't know check out our schedule"
4383120,4392880," check out the schedule according to our schedule we are streaming haskell every thursday that's right"
4392880,4402000," we as a matter of fact we did haskell yesterday yesterday we did haskell where have you been"
4403200,4408160," where have you been yesterday yesterday we had lower viewers than usual because nobody watches haskell"
4408160,4414240," and you you didn't come we were waiting for you we were waiting for you we were thinking where is"
4414240,4417520," twitch month and which man is more than there"
4423840,4430480," yeah but but but seriously like every thursday we program in husky so uh feel free to to join um"
4430480,4436880," so we we're developing the boat that is currently sitting in the chat"
4436880,4444160," uh so the boat that answers to the project command all of that stuff that boat by the way is written in"
4444160,4453600," haskell it's written haskell um so yeah uh and and we also did a little bit of sea on uh yesterday as well"
4453600,4457680," yes yesterday was thursday yes yesterday was thursday today's friday"
4457680,4459040," uh"
4459040,4465280," why displacement and not displacement"
4467120,4469600," uh it's a displacement"
4469600,4479120," i'm sorry i'm too lazy to fix that mistake i'm just too lazy all right so any other questions"
4486560,4496960," okay okay okay chat okay okay so i need to explore several shits here like i need to find something"
4496960,4502080," something useful uh something useful in this library that i can use"
4502080,4506000," png decoyer blah blah blah"
4508480,4515680," uh this is actually very inconvenient website i think i have to go to documentation uh take a look"
4515680,4520880," at the modules animation control so they they have animation controls but they don't really have a"
4520880,4529440," convenient stuff to to decode stuff output info so this is the output info and what does output info give me"
4529440,4537760," it gives me the color type uh it gives me the color type and it doesn't really let me control any of it"
4537760,4543200," right it doesn't really let me control anything it also gives me bit size and line size i suppose line"
4543200,4546080," size is basically the width that you have to take into account"
4546080,4554160," uh it's time to to ditch rust for odin what odin odin s"
4554160,4562640," everybody will understand that joke it's it's a very subtle it's it's a russian joke i would say um"
4567520,4572160," in russia we have our local programming language called one c"
4572160,4581040," right so well in english you would pronounce it like one c in russian one is"
4581040,4586960," a dean you you can actually pronounce it however you want but it's it's a dean and"
4586960,4596320," this one is not c in russian it's s so uh we in russia have a language that is literally pronounced like odin s"
4596320,4605760," i'm not even joking we have a programming language that we call odin s so if it's time to to ditch"
4605760,4610960," rust to odin what odin odin s no i'm not programming in odin s i'm sorry um"
4614320,4627040," oh you had i'm i do not disagree i mean come on um um odin is thick okay so why don't we learn odin s"
4627040,4635680," that's a good question maybe because it's literally in cyrillic and i'm not even joking so that language"
4635680,4643680," instead of letting characters it's using uh cyrillic what's funny is that it's not an original language"
4643680,4650080," though it's completely an original language what they did they took visual basic"
4650720,4659840," fucking visual basic and machine translated all the keywords and all the tokens to russian so it's a"
4659840,4669280," visual fucking basic translated to russian cyrillic that's what it is welcome to mother russia"
4670800,4679120," that's amazing i know i know i know that's believable um and this is called odin s yes exactly"
4681680,4686960," yeah yeah um i'm so proud of my country"
4686960,4692560," don't need to be basic"
4697680,4703920," god damn i thought audience think but apparently audience as is pretty mother flipping basic my god"
4703920,4704800," anyway"
4704800,4707360," um"
4707360,4715280," so yeah i'm just i'm just thinking is it even possible to sort of do some debug"
4715280,4716960," shit um"
4716960,4726640," don't get me wrong uh like nobody likes odin s in russia seriously even people who program in that"
4726640,4732160," language every day they hate this language they hate their job they hate themselves"
4732160,4737840," yes like nobody likes that language and the entire system that that language is used for like it's not"
4737840,4743200," really like a general purpose language it's a language that's used for accounting systems"
4743200,4750800," and uh that system is a huge mess it's a huge mess and everybody hates that system but that"
4750800,4758480," system is deeply integrated with uh the tax system of russian federation so you cannot really ditch it's"
4758480,4764160," like it's just there like it's it's impossible to get rid of it there's nothing you can do about that"
4764160,4772000," um all right so and let's try to actually like print info i i kind of want to see what exactly it gives"
4772000,4774880," us just in case i don't know why but i want to see that"
4774880,4787360," uh let's run it and uh yep it gave us color type rgb one of the things we can do you know is basically"
4788480,4798640," instead of doing that we can always just do that uh info uh what was that color type"
4800320,4807920," uh and in for bit depth right info bit depth so you can always sort of redirect this kind of"
4807920,4814880," shit what's funny is that you don't really have that much like how does it know the line size"
4814880,4818320," this is actually very interesting how does it know that"
4818320,4826160," because i never actually give it any any of this information but somehow"
4826160,4839440," this mother flipper knows that"
4839440,4841600," all right cargo ran it"
4841600,4848560," don't you notice something weird chat don't you notice something weird"
4848560,4855120," the original image has a line size of 861 what is the line size"
4856160,4862160," this line size"
4862160,4870000," so i suppose this is the actual width of the image"
4870000,4875280," right it's actual width so the width is 287 but there's also a little bit of padding"
4876240,4880000," um width multiplied by size you int"
4880000,4888800," yeah i suppose wait a second let me actually"
4888800,4895200," so if i divide it by four right if i divide it by four"
4906240,4918320," by three yeah it's 24 yeah it's 24. uh yeah now now it makes sense it's 24. so this is how it knows that so"
4919360,4923760," uh i see okay that means i'll have to do all that myself"
4923760,4929280," what's the purpose of time displacement what's the purpose of this language of this question"
4934080,4936880," time displacement has as much of a purpose as this question"
4936880,4939600," it doesn't"
4939600,4942800," got him"
4942800,4947200," all right"
4947200,4953120," so i think we also have to pass if we want to work with these kind of things right if we want to work"
4953120,4954000," with these kind of things"
4956000,4962960," uh we'll have to also pass pixel information otherwise we won't be able to properly parse it yes i think"
4962960,4966160," uh so yeah"
4966160,4967360," okay"
4967360,4971920," i guess i guess that's the that's the reality we have to uh we have to live in"
4971920,4976720," that's the reality so that means i'll have to accept output info"
4980720,4982000," so i'm going to pass it by"
4982000,4988400," this thing so what's interesting is that yeah it's all right it's all right"
4988400,4994160," so this is what we're going to do chat this is what we're going to do chat and i'm going to rotate"
4994160,5001280," image i'm going to pass this uh like the oh no no no no no no no this thing has to be mutable chat"
5001280,5010640," look look look this is mutable uh-huh okay damn it seven eight and uh"
5011120,5017680," we'll also have to pass info all of that by references and this is where we'll have to"
5017680,5029040," do all of that i wonder if color type enables you with um getting its own size in bytes"
5029040,5036000," samples returns the number of samples used per pixel of color type i have no idea what is that"
5036000,5043120," supposed to mean uh does it return three on rgba on rgb does it return three let's actually look"
5043120,5049120," at look at the source code yeah exactly so basically it returns the size like samples okay that actually"
5049120,5057680," makes it super easy to work with i think uh from you int uh temporary solution to us provides one"
5057680,5063200," i think i'm starting to understand how to use the center i think i i think i do uh which is super cool"
5065200,5073680," um news are against yeah news are against us so yeah don't don't post any"
5073680,5084240," so yeah for news you have to go on chatterbait unfortunately i cannot stream on chatterbait because"
5084240,5087680," i already have a contract with twitch so i'm not allowed to stream on chatterbait"
5089040,5098800," sorry um so what we'll have to do i think we'll have to iterate uh the height yes um"
5098800,5107840," the link was actually about odin if the link was actually about odin s it's also considered as nudes"
5107840,5115440," i'm sorry odin s is against us i'm sorry um so we're gonna iterate the role we're gonna start from"
5115440,5123280," uh this thing and we can i think we're gonna do that up until height half of the height"
5123280,5129120," i'm gonna divide it by two so you see what i'm trying to do you see what i'm trying to do"
5129120,5135120," like i'm iterating the rows okay damn uh i'm iterating the row"
5135120,5143040," i'm iterating the rows right so but i want to swap the rows"
5143920,5150160," that's what i want to do i just want to swap the rows so to do that what i'll have to do i'll have"
5150160,5156560," to iterate things like that right i'll iterate the row and then i have to take uh take the opposite"
5156560,5165680," row and swap them right then i go down and the opposite row is going to be this one and i swap those"
5165680,5171440," then the next one is going to be this and i swap those and the last one is going to be this and they meet"
5171440,5175840," it at at the center so i'm not going to do anything so this is basically what i'm going to do and that's"
5175840,5185920," why i'm iterating half of the rows make sense make sense i think it does iterating half of the rows cool"
5187440,5194720," so now um i need a way to get the nth pixels pixel or something like that"
5202320,5208880," so there's a structure quality this is a ton of i guess i'll have to do that myself like i wish"
5208880,5220240," i could give a pointer to u8 but this is actually super unsafe to be fair it's actually super unsafe"
5220240,5226720," but i wish i could just give a pointer to u8 and the color type and it would extract that thing to to my"
5226720,5234320," type uh but unfortunately i cannot easily do that the only thing i can do chat is i can assert uh i can"
5234320,5248240," assert that in four um color type is um color type rgb this is the only thing i can assert for now"
5249680,5256320," uh then later maybe we can add more support there maybe we'll get more support there so now we need"
5256320,5262560," to locate a pixel we need to locate a pixel unfortunately we have like a linear buffer"
5262560,5272960," right and we need to locate pixel there uh so what is the current row row is this thing i have to multiply"
5272960,5284080," it by in four line size right and there you go i located the position of the row i located the position"
5284080,5290560," of the row uh but now uh i also have to iterate the columns uh this one is actually very interesting"
5290560,5294320," uh we'll have to iterate the columns but we this time we're going to iterate them up until the end"
5296240,5308160," okay so and here i just do plus column but multiplied by the size of the pixel right multiplied by the"
5308160,5313520," size of the pixel what's the size of the pixel the size of the pixel is uh in and for"
5313520,5318160," uh color type"
5321280,5328560," kevin's jobber i hope i pronounced incorrectly wait a second uh wait a second i need to"
5328560,5335840," wait until it loads up here i take my money and look at odin lang uh thank you so much for ten dollars"
5335840,5342560," uh and odin lang.org i heard about this language yes i know that the creator of this language streams on"
5342560,5351200," twitch thank you so much for ten dollars uh yes it's uh basically yet another killer of c or c plus"
5351200,5360240," plus plus it's in the same league i suppose as zig neem uh maybe it's comparable to rust but rust has"
5360240,5368160," like some novel features i'm not sure if they're in the same league so yeah um let's take a look"
5368160,5375920," can you download this thing can you download uh there's some knightly ubuntu well i'm using debian"
5375920,5381120," right i'm using debian let's take a look at this thing um third party don't you get"
5381120,5398240," and zip by the way uh all right ubuntu artifacts so okay that's that's a that's a cool name for"
5398240,5405120," um for a folder for for this thing when you unwrap your odin language uh you're gonna be greeted"
5405120,5418160," with a folder called ubuntu artifact sure nice nice one okay uh and here we supposedly have an executable"
5418160,5427200," which is not marked as executable so you have to seriously i mean could you please prepare your"
5427200,5435200," ubuntu artifact like you just throw just tossed at me some whatever ci pooped out without making it a"
5435200,5441840," little bit prettier like rename ubuntu artifacts and also made this thing executable uh but is it really"
5441840,5447920," an executable i'm not yeah it is in fact executable it's dynamically linked on top of that and um"
5447920,5453600," well luckily i have all of the dependencies right luckily i have all of the dependencies"
5454240,5473760," so there's no nothing in the shared object okay um thank you for 10 dollars anyway uh let's continue"
5477840,5489760," um so this is how we do that so this is how we locate the particular pixel right uh the particular"
5489760,5494800," pixel but this one is going to be actually uh a red right this one is going to be actually red"
5494800,5502960," uh and uh now if i do something like this uh if i want to locate green for example i have to add one"
5502960,5511920," so this one is going to be green so this is how we're going to do r uh g uh b this is going to be the"
5511920,5518320," second one this is by the way why we assert that the color type is specifically rgb"
5518320,5529200," specific rgb right so and uh yeah i don't know how to abstract that thing away maybe the best way would be to"
5530960,5538000," uh create uh create some sort of a structure of a pixel um right that is basically something like this"
5538000,5548000," this is going to be gb a and then create a function that accepts oh by the way this one has to be eight"
5548000,5556000," i forgot about that and somehow accepts this one is very interesting well at least"
5558560,5568640," yeah okay so it accepts the uh this thing and output info"
5568640,5578560," output info and returns you that pixel right oh this is not how we do that i'm sorry i'm i'm programming"
5578560,5589920," and see and uh yeah there we go um so um yeah this is probably probably what you want to do and here"
5589920,5595680," inside of this kind of thing you would match in for color type and depending on the color type"
5595680,5602480," first of all you would advance the buffer several pixels further let's actually do it ourselves and i don't"
5602480,5610480," quite understand why png didn't do that themselves do they have that kind of solution like do they have"
5610480,5618000," anything like that uh pixel dimensions no idea what the fuck is that i have no idea like this is literally"
5618000,5625600," what i want and it's not that difficult to implement look you just do color type rgb"
5625600,5634560," right png color type rgb and in that particular case you simply return pixel r"
5636960,5645520," um buffer so you assume that the buffer is at that thing"
5645520,5652480," you can check the info you think there's something in and for right you or what you mean"
5654960,5662000," um to the buffer size there's nothing there i suppose i already see anything useful"
5662000,5667600," uh maybe i'm missing something i'm pretty sure there should be something like that in the in the"
5667600,5674560," standard library itself i think a png is supposed to be just the decoder encoder there's a high level"
5674560,5680480," libraries literally called image that has high level obstructions maybe but i'm kind of okay with"
5680480,5685600," that like it's not that much of the lack of the abstraction so this is kind of abstraction that i"
5685600,5692000," can implement myself if i need to i'm not even sure if i need them so i'm not going to go there but if"
5692000,5697040," i'm going to start having trouble i'll probably have to invest some time into doing that all right"
5697040,5707280," so this is rgb and now we have to take the opposite role right we have to take the opposite role"
5707920,5717120," um all role what is the opposite role well um in case of the situation one two three four you have"
5717120,5724240," five elements and if your row is zero um okay i think i want to actually come into that if your row is"
5724240,5731440," zero uh you want to have four and as an opposite role right you want to have four as an opposite role"
5731440,5738480," so in that case you would take n five subtract zero but five is not the opposite row so we'll have to"
5738480,5745360," subtract one so the thing we have to do we'll have to do in four height minus row"
5745360,5752640," minus one so this is how we get an opposite role so and let's check that formula works"
5752640,5758640," uh five minus one is going to be four but the opposite row is three minus one is going to be"
5758640,5768160," three so this is the opposite role uh okay it works so this is how we do that and similarly we get pixels"
5768160,5778720," of the opposite of the opposite row somewhere here like so uh-huh there we go and we're gonna assign rgb"
5778720,5788400," uh here like so um i guess that's it this is how we're gonna rotate the image upside down i think"
5788400,5794800," i think i think this is how we're gonna do that so let's see if it works or not uh cargo run it doesn't"
5794800,5798720," compile of course because i put zero here for some reason because probably i was trying to explain"
5798720,5806000," something um output info is not available um i think at the time has come to you know do something like"
5806000,5815760," like this i think it's gonna be super convenient uh info mismatch type uh you int but found use size"
5817600,5825440," so what is the type of line size uh line size is u size but row is yeah this one is interesting"
5825440,5831440," like it's kind of weird so line size is u size but width and height are u32"
5831440,5842640," but still there are sizes there are still sizes um cool well i mean i can do something like uh as"
5843680,5852960," u size i don't mind i don't mind doing that um as u size which makes it a little bit longer and the"
5852960,5858880," core type when i do oh and this one is not correct because you have to take the amount of samples"
5858880,5867600," you see this size of like the way how we get this is actually becomes bigger and bigger"
5870240,5877440," uh has some sort of a prelude uh i don't think so i don't see any previous um i think the time has come"
5877440,5885440," to sort of like create a function that accepts the buffer right accepts the buffer um"
5888720,5901920," takes the info right some sort of info and also row and column and returns us the position of the well"
5901920,5912560," well yeah this one is it's kind of it's kind of weird we can return an index yeah i think it makes"
5912560,5919680," sense to return an index so how should we call this function so basically i want to encapsulate this"
5919680,5931440," kind of stuff and yeah since it returns an index it is going to work perfectly um pixel index yeah it's"
5931440,5937120," still not going to be as small as i wanted it to be but uh maybe i will be able to do something about"
5937120,5942800," that anyway so i'm going to encapsulate this entire here so row is already your size and i have to"
5942800,5948480," care about that uh line size call info color type samples and this this is basically how we access a"
5948480,5959200," single a single thing here um and let's see how it will simplify it pixel index uh buffer by the way"
5960160,5966080," you don't need buffer if you think about that you don't need buffer we calculate in the index so you"
5966080,5973200," see by using indices instead of pointers we circumvent borrow checker"
5973200,5989120," this is this is basically how rust developers circumvent borrow checker this is amazing yes they use indices"
5990160,6003520," uh yeah yeah yeah epic yeah pointers are basically indices into ram but when it comes to the indices"
6003520,6009200," you kind of lose all the advantages of borrow checker right i wonder how much time it will take for the"
6009200,6014560," rust developers to realize that and then we'll try they will try to come up with a mechanism to enforce"
6014560,6016960," borrow enforced borrow checker on indices"
6016960,6025200," and imagine how more unbearable that language will become if you will have borrow checker on indices as"
6025200,6033600," well um absolutely i love that i like where the language is going uh anyway"
6033600,6042640," so uh we'll have to provide that info and row is going to be just a row column and yeah it's actually"
6042640,6048880," simplifies this entire but unfortunately row and column has to be uh sizes but i wonder if i can just"
6048880,6056160," do as you size here and as you size here uh just basically convert them to you sizes like that and"
6056160,6068400," don't think about that too much uh huh pixel index info row column and as a matter of fact you can actually"
6068400,6072560," precalculate it's actually pre-calculate it only once if you think about it so you don't have to do that the"
6072560,6080640," index is going to be this and you can just have index index"
6080640,6088720," yeah should have done that like a little bit earlier um and in this particular situation you're going to"
6088720,6101920," have all index pixel index in for all row column and the same situation goes here uh index might as well"
6101920,6111600," actually use yeah let me do that a little like that index cool"
6114000,6123120," uh maybe oh by the way this this one is all index this one is all index and i'm thinking uh can we"
6123120,6128480," inline i think it's not that much of the line to inline that and we can actually have something like"
6128480,6133360," this and we can even take it like that"
6133360,6143920," uh-huh then take this what the f*ck happened excuse me and take this sh*t"
6146640,6158720," and put it here and of course you should not forget uh a line"
6158720,6163200," as you can line properly unfortunately"
6168480,6177840," okay boom i kind of like i kind of low key want to do this kind of sh*t to you know to align it"
6177840,6181760," properly even though plus zero doesn't make any sense but it indicates the intent at least"
6181760,6188480," at least it indicates the intent uh all right so doesn't look good doesn't look good i think it's"
6188480,6195520," pretty pretty pretty pretty good uh epic uh will that compile uh will that compile it doesn't"
6195520,6202400," really compile uh because sure of course of course uh semicolon what else what else what else"
6202400,6205120," what else a minus row expected to 32 really"
6206160,6213300," Sure. Would you look at that?"
6236160,6242000," Perfection."
6266160,6275780," In case somebody needs that. In case somebody needs this shit, so feel free to use it."
6275780,6283720," All right. We'll need to fix that. I wonder what exactly went wrong, but we'll see."
6283720,6293400," Yeah, that's weird. That's absolutely weird."
6295720,6299600," Okay, let's make a cup of tea chat. Do you have any questions? Do you have any suggestions?"
6299600,6303660," I'll be back changing before I peeks you on LinkedIn."
6303660,6315680," Ah, swapping. Jesus fucking Christ. It's a classical shit."
6315680,6319480," Yeah. Do you have swap, by the way?"
6319480,6323400," Yeah. I made a classical fucking mistake."
6325280,6330160," Twitch says I have to share this. Dusty Pauzy, thank you so much for sharing that."
6330160,6335060," Thank you for sharing that you've been subscribed for six months, tier two."
6335060,6340300," My God. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for tier two subscription."
6340300,6343300," And welcome back to our epic Rust Club."
6343840,6351340," So, where's the docs link? Do I even have... Oh, yeah. I do have a bookmark because I was actually burned by that so many times."
6351340,6354400," Do you have swap? Or do I have to implement that myself?"
6354400,6356480," So, there's a memory swap. Okay."
6356480,6358380," Or maybe there is a slices swap."
6358380,6362720," Ooh, spicy. Yeah, this is exactly what I can use."
6363060,6365420," Okay. Yeah, there we go."
6365420,6368820," Mem swap."
6368820,6374380," And I'll have to pass it as mutable variables, which I'm okay."
6374380,6376040," I'm actually okay with."
6378620,6387900," So, I hope BorrowChecker wouldn't mind that because we're already borrowing this thing and we're sort of going to land it even further."
6387900,6389820," We're going to land it even further."
6389820,6391580," That might be a problem."
6391580,6394720," BorrowChecker may not actually allow that, but I'm not quite sure."
6394720,6395040," Yeah."
6395040,6398740," Mem is undeclared because it's stdmem."
6399740,6400560," You know what?"
6400560,6405960," Let's actually use stdmem swap and just call it swap."
6405960,6406740," I mean, come on."
6406740,6411080," Let's make it a little bit easier for ourselves."
6411080,6412620," So, BorrowChecker is going to be okay with it."
6412620,6412920," Nah."
6412920,6415920," Yeah, boy."
6415920,6417700," Yeah, boy."
6417700,6420160," BorrowChecker is not okay with that."
6420160,6422140," It's not okay with that."
6422140,6425500," Second mutable."
6425500,6426220," Yeah."
6426220,6428460," Because we're doing"
6428460,6433580," we're borrowing the same thing twice."
6433580,6436500," We have to use probably SliceSwap."
6436500,6438980," So, you see, remember how it had several swaps?"
6438980,6440520," Like, there was a SliceSwap."
6440520,6443720," So, and SliceSwap, I think,"
6443720,6447200," actually addresses that problem of BorrowChecker."
6447200,6448900," Yeah."
6448900,6451120," For fuck's sake."
6451120,6452020," Oh, my God."
6452020,6454980," They created a separate version of swap"
6454980,6457940," specifically to address that problem."
6458220,6458840," Wait a second."
6458840,6459380," Really?"
6459380,6462040," This is hilarious, in my opinion."
6462040,6463980," Oh, my God."
6463980,6469680," Buff"
6469680,6471780," swap"
6471780,6472500," index"
6472500,6473700," plus zero"
6473700,6474520," or index"
6474520,6475960," can actually"
6475960,6477320," query replace that."
6477320,6478660," I mean, not query replace,"
6478740,6480560," but at least use something like this."
6480560,6483520," I think it will be a little bit easier for us."
6483520,6484900," So, we're going to do swap."
6484900,6486080," We can remove that."
6486080,6487720," That."
6487720,6490220," I guess this is how we do that, right?"
6490220,6491420," So, this is how we do that."
6491420,6492600," Yeah."
6492600,6493200," Would you look at that?"
6493200,6495300," This is how, this is literally how we do that."
6495300,6496780," So, to address this problem,"
6496780,6499560," for slices, they specifically created a separate swap."
6500320,6500740," All right."
6500740,6503000," By the way, I like how simple the code become."
6503000,6504800," Actually, I kind of like this code."
6504800,6505720," Yeah."
6505720,6509420," So, and this is basically, yeah,"
6509420,6511560," even the RAS developers themselves,"
6511560,6512860," the standard library developers,"
6513080,6514280," still use indices"
6514280,6516520," to circumvent borrow checker."
6516520,6519340," This is kind of weird, right?"
6519340,6520740," It's almost like"
6520740,6523580," nobody realizes that indices"
6523580,6524920," are pretty much pointers"
6524920,6525780," or references."
6525780,6526460," It's like,"
6526460,6529960," it's sort of like a backdoor"
6529960,6533340," for borrow checker."
6533340,6535440," You don't like borrow checker?"
6535440,6537200," Just use indices instead of pointers"
6537200,6539700," and it will just basically disable borrow checker."
6539700,6541580," Interesting."
6542580,6543560," This is very interesting."
6543560,6546300," But again,"
6546300,6548880," since there is no borrow checker,"
6548880,6552120," like you can make mistakes still,"
6552120,6554620," semantical ones."
6554620,6560560," All right."
6560560,6561520," Interesting."
6561520,6564000," Okay."
6564000,6566680," So, we have expected and use."
6566680,6568080," All right."
6568080,6570480," And if we take a look at this thing now,"
6572080,6573080," there we go."
6573080,6574740," We just rotated it."
6574740,6575440," Isn't that epic?"
6575440,6576040," Isn't that epic?"
6576040,6576740," I think it's pretty."
6590580,6591640," Oh, yeah."
6591640,6591660," Oh, yeah."
6591660,6592960," It's a herb."
6592960,6594040," Yeah."
6594040,6608080," And this is,"
6608080,6608520," by the way,"
6608520,6609360," like I think"
6609360,6611620," it's borrow checker"
6611620,6612360," is kind of weird."
6613020,6614940," like it's some kind of hard-coded rule."
6614940,6617900," Hard-coded arbitrary rule"
6617900,6619620," that is not disableable."
6619620,6620960," So,"
6620960,6621740," what I think"
6621740,6623840," a proper solution would be"
6623840,6625040," is a mechanism"
6625040,6626520," that allows you to implement"
6626520,6627720," your own borrow checker"
6627720,6630840," and maybe go even beyond borrow checker."
6630840,6632520," Maybe there should be mechanism"
6632520,6634600," that would allow you to do checks"
6634600,6636280," specifically for your projects."
6637220,6637460," So,"
6637460,6638240," yeah."
6638240,6639140," I think"
6639140,6640160," there will be something like that."
6640160,6640440," Maybe"
6640440,6641680," if I want to enforce"
6641680,6643260," borrow checker-like behavior"
6643260,6643760," on indices,"
6643760,6644900," I should be able to do that."
6644900,6647240," But if I don't,"
6647240,6648100," I can disable that."
6648100,6648480," So,"
6648480,6648980," that would be actually"
6648980,6649780," a pretty epic mechanism."
6649780,6652200," That would be actually"
6652200,6653240," a pretty epic mechanism."
6653240,6655120," Maybe try C++ for that."
6655120,6655800," Oh, well,"
6655800,6658020," I don't know C++ much."
6658020,6658340," So,"
6658340,6660680," I heard it's a new hot language,"
6660680,6661240," right?"
6661300,6661540," So,"
6661540,6663080," I heard that it's going to kill Rust."
6663080,6666480," But I'm kind of skeptical about it."
6666480,6666800," I mean,"
6666800,6668480," Rust has been there for ages."
6668480,6668860," Like,"
6668860,6670080," for how long has Rust been there?"
6670080,6675840," Rust programming language."
6675840,6676780," Let's go to"
6676780,6678460," Wiki."
6678460,6680620," Let's go to Wiki."
6680620,6683080," Yeah,"
6683080,6684100," Rust has been there for ages,"
6684100,6685060," like for nine years."
6685060,6685900," In IT"
6685900,6687080," and software development,"
6687080,6688320," nine years is,"
6688320,6688920," you know,"
6688920,6689420," eternity."
6689420,6690240," Right."
6690240,6691280," And I heard about C++"
6691300,6692260," only yesterday."
6692260,6693260," So,"
6693260,6694060," I don't know."
6694060,6695240," I think we should give C++"
6695240,6696120," a little bit more time."
6696120,6696580," But people"
6696580,6698220," are super hyped about C++"
6698220,6699400," and they keep saying"
6699400,6700420," that it's going to kill Rust"
6700420,6700800," somehow."
6700800,6701880," I have no idea how."
6701880,6703720," But we'll see."
6703720,6704880," We'll see."
6704880,6705180," We'll see."
6705180,6705840," Okay."
6705840,6711500," What do we got?"
6711500,6712500," What do we get?"
6712500,6718000," So,"
6718000,6719200," I think we need to make"
6719200,6720080," another cup of tea chat."
6720080,6720920," Do you have any questions?"
6721020,6721560," Any suggestions,"
6721560,6722020," complaints,"
6722020,6722500," anything?"
6722500,6724120," Feel free to leave them"
6724120,6724520," in the chat."
6724520,6725900," Oh,"
6725900,6726200," and by the way,"
6726200,6727380," if you really have any complaints,"
6727380,6728740," we have an exclamation mark"
6728740,6729560," complaint command."
6729560,6730800," After that command,"
6730800,6732180," you can put your complaint there"
6732180,6734080," and I'll read it"
6734080,6735080," and address it later."
6735080,6735480," So,"
6735480,6736260," don't worry about it."
6736260,6738620," Okay."
6739740,6740120," so,"
6740120,6741180," how are you guys doing today?"
6741180,6744500," How are you guys doing today?"
6744500,6745460," Bro."
6748400,6757620," super good."
6757620,6762760," Super good."
6762760,6764400," Is labor day in Brazil"
6764400,6765640," so you don't have to work?"
6765640,6766800," It's kind of funny"
6766800,6767780," how you don't have to work"
6767780,6768460," on a labor day."
6768460,6772040," Interesting."
6772040,6772480," Let's see."
6772480,6778900," Okay."
6778900,6779780," Why not C++?"
6779780,6780280," Yeah."
6780280,6781620," OMG adder."
6781620,6783700," I'm not really sure"
6783700,6785100," if OMG adder makes any sense."
6785100,6786780," OMG Python does make sense."
6786780,6791280," But OMG adder doesn't really."
6791280,6793900," Labor day."
6793900,6794580," Oh,"
6794580,6795120," wait a second."
6795240,6796520," it's also labor day in Russia."
6796520,6797980," Since I'm neat,"
6797980,6799580," I have no idea"
6799580,6801320," about holidays."
6801320,6803080," It is also labor day in Russia."
6803080,6804140," May 1st."
6804140,6804560," Yes."
6804560,6804900," Yes."
6804900,6805880," Goddamn."
6805880,6815220," It's an international holiday."
6815220,6815880," Interesting."
6815880,6817800," For some reason,"
6817800,6818480," like I would assume"
6818480,6819600," that May 1st"
6819600,6820360," as a labor day"
6820360,6822400," is a very Soviet thing."
6822400,6823200," But apparently"
6823200,6824000," it's the same"
6824000,6824920," in other places."
6825240,6828800," Bjorn Stravstorp"
6828800,6829240," just called"
6829240,6830660," he wants his balls back."
6830660,6831620," I didn't take his balls."
6831620,6832020," I'm sorry."
6832020,6832320," So,"
6832320,6833060," I don't know."
6833060,6836400," Labor day"
6836400,6836920," all the wrong way."
6836920,6837140," Whatever."
6837140,6837580," I thought"
6837580,6838400," it was exclusive."
6838400,6838820," Yeah,"
6838820,6839900," exactly."
6839900,6840800," I thought"
6840800,6842040," it's a very communist"
6842040,6843380," like Soviet thing"
6843380,6844800," and we sort of"
6844800,6845960," celebrate it by inertia"
6845960,6846480," but apparently"
6846480,6847060," it's all around."
6847060,6847840," Wait a second."
6847840,6849100," We have to Google it up."
6849100,6851540," May 1st"
6851540,6852540," holiday."
6852540,6854100," What the fuck is that?"
6854100,6854480," So,"
6854480,6855200," yeah."
6855240,6857920," May day."
6857920,6861300," Is a public holiday"
6861300,6861980," usually submitted"
6861980,6863020," on the first Monday"
6863020,6863940," of May?"
6863940,6864740," It is ancient"
6864740,6866140," festival of spring"
6866140,6867900," and current"
6867900,6868720," traditional spring"
6868720,6869060," holiday"
6869060,6870400," in many European cultures."
6870400,6871260," Yeah,"
6871260,6871900," okay."
6871900,6874360," So,"
6874360,6875940," it was chosen"
6875940,6876460," as the date"
6876460,6876960," for International"
6876960,6877440," Workers' Day"
6877440,6878100," by the social."
6878100,6878940," Okay."
6880360,6880920," basically"
6880920,6881280," the"
6881280,6882480," fucking"
6882480,6883020," communists"
6883020,6883660," appropriated"
6883660,6883980," that."
6883980,6884860," I see."
6884860,6889860," Yeah,"
6889860,6890200," so,"
6890200,6890580," it basically"
6890580,6891300," was appropriated"
6891300,6892380," from the"
6892380,6893340," ancient"
6893340,6894460," spring festival"
6894460,6895040," or something."
6895040,6896060," Yeah,"
6896060,6897020," I see."
6897020,6897580," Now I know."
6897580,6898460," Thank you so much."
6898580,6899140," thank you so much"
6899140,6899700," for letting me know."
6899700,6902200," Oh,"
6902200,6902500," what's up,"
6902500,6902940," what I realized?"
6902940,6903320," Hello,"
6903320,6903540," hello."
6906040,6914920," let's boil up"
6914920,6915420," some water."
6915420,6916480," Let's boil up some water."
6921100,6922060," I'm running out"
6922060,6922720," of Earl Grey."
6922720,6925020," Gloopchat."
6925020,6926100," This is"
6926100,6926880," regular tea."
6926880,6928300," This is"
6928300,6928800," Earl Grey."
6928800,6937460," I guess,"
6937460,6938560," okay,"
6938560,6939120," I'm not gonna do"
6939120,6939900," a Strauss troop joke."
6939900,6944080," All right."
6944080,6948400," How about"
6948400,6948820," whiskey?"
6948820,6949680," That's what I'm having."
6949680,6950060," I'm sorry,"
6950060,6950820," I don't drink alcohol."
6951100,6954940," I thought"
6954940,6955880," that Earl Grey"
6955880,6956700," is as normal"
6956700,6957560," as tea gets."
6957560,6957940," I mean,"
6957940,6958440," Earl Grey"
6958440,6958960," contains,"
6958960,6960000," this one"
6960000,6960540," contains"
6960540,6961460," bergamot oil."
6961460,6964800," That one"
6964800,6965220," does not."
6965220,6965900," So,"
6965900,6966420," that's the whole"
6966420,6966700," difference"
6966700,6967100," as far as"
6967100,6967460," you can tell."
6967460,6972320," So,"
6972320,6975260," I guess"
6975260,6975740," that one"
6975740,6976560," is a little"
6976560,6977060," bit more"
6977060,6977420," normal"
6977420,6978160," than Earl Grey."
6981100,6986280," you know,"
6986280,6986700," the tea"
6986700,6987380," growing channel"
6987380,6987920," on science"
6987920,6988420," and technology."
6988420,6988640," Yeah,"
6988640,6989020," exactly."
6989020,6991020," Tea growing."
6991020,6991940," Am I right?"
6991940,6994220," So,"
6994220,6995240," what we need to do?"
6995240,6995660," Now,"
6995660,6996440," we need to learn"
6996440,6997360," how to load"
6997360,6998840," a range of images,"
6998840,6999620," right,"
6999880,7000800," and try to do"
7000800,7002500," time displacement"
7002500,7003160," on them."
7003160,7004420," That's what we want"
7004420,7004940," to try to do."
7004940,7008480," That's what we want"
7008480,7009280," to try to do."
7009280,7012940," What the fuck"
7012940,7013440," is going on?"
7013440,7014520," I don't quite understand."
7014520,7016460," Something is consuming"
7016460,7017080," my resources"
7017080,7018180," so fucking much."
7018720,7019880," don't quite understand"
7019880,7020540," what exactly."
7020540,7023080," All right."
7023080,7027600," I don't know."
7027600,7028680," Okay,"
7028680,7029580," so we're ready"
7029580,7030400," to make a cup"
7030400,7030700," of tea"
7030700,7032480," because I was"
7032480,7032900," waiting"
7032900,7034820," for the"
7034820,7035240," water"
7035240,7036180," to boil up."
7036180,7038460," So,"
7038460,7038980," here's my"
7038980,7039540," boiled up"
7039540,7039940," water."
7039940,7042060," All right."
7045960,7046960," Using a Soviet"
7046960,7047660," atom-driven"
7047660,7049400," water cooler."
7049400,7050240," I mean,"
7050240,7052200," isn't anything"
7052200,7053100," thermal"
7053100,7053960," basically"
7053960,7054800," atom-driven"
7054800,7055880," because"
7055880,7056880," temperature"
7056880,7058720," is basically"
7058720,7059360," an average"
7059360,7060060," velocity"
7060060,7060960," of the atoms,"
7060960,7061580," is it not?"
7061580,7063320," I think,"
7063320,7063520," well,"
7063520,7064240," I'm not a physicist"
7064240,7065080," so I have no idea"
7065080,7065620," but I mean,"
7065620,7066880," I thought like"
7066880,7067680," anything thermal"
7067680,7068520," is basically"
7068520,7069120," atom-driven."
7069120,7073760," So,"
7073760,7076600," depends on"
7076600,7076860," what you're"
7076860,7077440," trying to say"
7077440,7078160," I suppose."
7078160,7088140," All right."
7088140,7088740," There we go."
7088740,7090520," We're ready to go."
7090520,7098440," Yeah."
7098440,7099040," Yes,"
7099040,7099700," my computer"
7099700,7100480," is a quantum computer"
7100480,7101160," as quantum stuff"
7101160,7101960," happens inside it."
7101960,7102800," You got it."
7103120,7103800," You got it."
7103800,7106860," What is"
7106860,7107260," what is"
7107260,7107880," that old man?"
7107880,7108500," Why are you"
7108500,7109040," sending that"
7109040,7109600," to the chat?"
7109600,7110000," I'm actually"
7110000,7110660," kind of scared."
7110660,7112020," What the hell"
7112020,7112420," is that?"
7112420,7113240," Oh,"
7113240,7113560," thank you"
7113560,7114100," for sending it"
7114100,7114300," back."
7114300,7114700," I really"
7114700,7115240," appreciate that."
7115240,7115740," Thank you."
7115740,7118140," Thank you"
7118140,7118640," for constantly"
7118640,7119260," reminding us"
7119260,7119760," about this"
7119760,7120040," image."
7120040,7120320," Yes,"
7120320,7120560," yes,"
7120560,7120860," yes."
7120860,7121660," Because we"
7121660,7122180," almost forgot."
7122180,7122480," We should"
7122480,7122980," never forget."
7122980,7124680," Yeah."
7124680,7126260," It's you."
7126260,7126720," Paul,"
7126720,7127040," you."
7127040,7127860," Yeah."
7127860,7129560," So,"
7129560,7129960," we need"
7129960,7130420," a bunch"
7130420,7130860," of PNG"
7130860,7131240," images"
7131240,7131700," as a matter"
7131700,7132120," of fact."
7132200,7132960," so let's"
7132960,7133340," use"
7133340,7134180," some kind"
7134180,7134660," of public"
7134660,7135120," domain"
7135120,7135640," video."
7135640,7136980," Who knows"
7136980,7137700," the famous"
7137700,7138300," public domain"
7138300,7138660," video"
7138660,7140220," with a fat"
7140220,7140840," thick"
7140840,7141440," bunny?"
7141440,7142840," Yes,"
7142840,7143320," we need"
7143320,7143580," to find"
7143580,7144000," that one."
7144000,7148860," Not"
7148860,7149300," body shaming,"
7149300,7149720," by the way."
7149720,7150300," That bunny"
7150300,7150720," is beautiful"
7150720,7151180," in my opinion."
7151180,7151820," I fucking"
7151820,7152180," love him."
7152180,7152860," I fucking"
7152860,7153340," love him."
7153340,7155060," So,"
7155060,7156540," how is it"
7156540,7156700," called?"
7156700,7157020," Does anybody"
7157020,7157420," remember?"
7157420,7158040," Does anybody"
7158040,7158380," remember"
7158380,7159200," the name"
7159200,7159620," of that?"
7159620,7160700," Blender"
7160700,7160940," bunny"
7160940,7161320," or something"
7161320,7161800," like that?"
7161800,7168220," Yeah,"
7168220,7168580," Big"
7168580,7169140," Buck"
7169140,7169640," Bunny."
7169640,7170860," This is so"
7170860,7171160," beautiful."
7171160,7171700," This is such"
7171700,7172040," a beautiful"
7172040,7172420," cartoon,"
7172420,7172920," in my opinion."
7172920,7174700," Where I can"
7174700,7175320," download it?"
7175320,7176620," As far as I"
7176620,7176720," know,"
7176720,7177160," it's like,"
7177160,7177600," you know,"
7177600,7178220," public domain."
7178220,7178720," You can do"
7178720,7179120," whatever you"
7179120,7179520," want with it,"
7179560,7180100," and this"
7180100,7180320," is the"
7180320,7180620," reason why"
7180620,7181160," people use"
7181160,7181880," it as a"
7181880,7182840," test stuff."
7182840,7186960," Big"
7186960,7187960," bug"
7187960,7188600," bunny"
7188600,7189460," download."
7189460,7190200," Can we"
7190200,7190720," download that?"
7190720,7193280," There we go."
7193280,7194360," Beautiful,"
7194360,7195060," beautiful bunny."
7195060,7198000," It literally"
7198000,7198560," had like"
7198560,7199580," download and"
7199580,7200100," there is a"
7200100,7200720," YouTube and"
7200720,7201080," there is a"
7201080,7202000," streaming and"
7202000,7202340," there is"
7202340,7203000," there a direct"
7203000,7203500," link."
7203500,7204220," So,"
7204220,7204620," okay,"
7204620,7205120," so you can"
7205120,7205760," download this"
7205760,7206060," thing,"
7206060,7207020," file types,"
7207020,7207660," mp4."
7208780,7209020," okay,"
7209020,7209620," but these"
7209620,7210340," these are not"
7210340,7210780," clickable,"
7210780,7211360," unfortunately."
7211360,7212600," These are not"
7212600,7212900," clickable."
7212900,7213020," Oh,"
7213020,7213760," there you go."
7213760,7214260," So,"
7214260,7214600," let's actually"
7214600,7214980," go with"
7214980,7215740," something very"
7215740,7216240," small."
7216240,7217740," Let's go with"
7217740,7218220," something very"
7218220,7218640," small."
7218640,7219580," Move a"
7219580,7220340," okay,"
7220340,7221080," stereo."
7221080,7221360," We're gonna"
7221360,7221680," go with"
7221680,7222160," this area."
7222160,7223240," There we go."
7223240,7225060," So,"
7225060,7226060," let's go with"
7226060,7226800," the data"
7226800,7227640," folder and"
7227640,7228520," let's do"
7228520,7229760," wget and"
7229760,7230660," there we"
7230660,7231100," go."
7231100,7231840," There we go."
7231840,7232480," Let's download"
7232480,7233040," that shit."
7233040,7233720," Is it?"
7233720,7234380," Oh,"
7234380,7235080," my God."
7235080,7236240," How big"
7236240,7236520," is it?"
7238520,7240860," I think"
7240860,7241160," we need"
7241160,7242440," to download"
7242440,7243820," a smaller"
7243820,7244480," version in"
7244480,7244900," my opinion."
7244900,7246380," And we need"
7246380,7246720," to download"
7246720,7247160," a smaller"
7247160,7247460," version."
7247460,7249760," So,"
7249760,7250120," this is"
7250120,7250700," the one"
7250700,7251360," that is"
7251360,7251920," probably"
7251920,7252540," I've no"
7252540,7253060," idea how"
7253060,7253780," big it is"
7253780,7254320," or how"
7254320,7254760," small it"
7254760,7255000," is."
7255000,7256440," Kilobytes,"
7256440,7257320," megabytes,"
7257320,7258200," 64 megabytes."
7258200,7258500," Okay."
7258500,7259620," Sure."
7259620,7261660," 64 megabytes."
7261660,7262720," We can"
7262720,7263120," try to do"
7263120,7263580," that one."
7263580,7265800," Okay."
7268260,7269200," Oh."
7269200,7273280," They"
7273280,7273620," fucking"
7273620,7274640," banned us."
7274640,7276540," I just"
7276540,7277180," tried to"
7277180,7277740," download a"
7277740,7278380," different file"
7278380,7278640," and they"
7278640,7278900," already"
7278900,7279280," fucking"
7279280,7279980," smacked us"
7279980,7280200," in the"
7280200,7280480," face."
7280480,7285300," Really?"
7285300,7287400," I mean,"
7287400,7288300," I suppose"
7288300,7288780," they have"
7288780,7289580," a lot"
7289580,7290580," of people"
7290580,7291080," trying to"
7291080,7291620," download that"
7291620,7292140," because how"
7292140,7292840," famous that"
7292840,7293320," thing is."
7293320,7293820," Everybody's"
7293820,7294160," trying to"
7294160,7294740," download that."
7296040,7296760," but is"
7296760,7297220," there any"
7297220,7297840," mirrors"
7297840,7298780," from where"
7298780,7299220," I can..."
7299220,7299360," Okay."
7299360,7299720," So,"
7299720,7300080," there's"
7300080,7300620," some sort"
7300620,7301180," of mirrors."
7301180,7302500," Lithuania,"
7302500,7303740," Italy."
7303740,7305660," So,"
7305660,7306000," let's actually"
7306000,7306540," try to"
7306540,7307220," download as"
7307220,7307620," small as"
7307620,7308000," possible"
7308000,7308680," uncompressed."
7308680,7310480," Let's try it"
7310480,7310820," one more time."
7310820,7311420," Maybe they"
7311420,7312180," already unbanned it."
7312180,7312600," Maybe it's"
7312600,7314140," not that..."
7314140,7314860," They already"
7314860,7315380," banned us."
7317380,7321620," Okay."
7321620,7322900," Netherlands."
7322900,7324960," All right."
7324960,7325300," I'm going to"
7325300,7325540," try to"
7325540,7326020," download that"
7326020,7326840," one from"
7326840,7327200," Netherlands."
7327200,7329680," There we go."
7329680,7332320," Really?"
7332320,7335280," Oh."
7335280,7342720," Just give me"
7342720,7343380," something already."
7343380,7344020," Jesus Christ."
7344020,7344540," Why is it so"
7344540,7345020," difficult to"
7345020,7345580," download this"
7345580,7345800," shit?"
7347380,7369300," short public"

7373560,7374040," I just need"
7374040,7374460," something."
7376680,7377360," Last time I"
7377360,7377560," checked,"
7377560,7378020," half of the"
7378020,7378420," mirrors were"
7378420,7378700," dead."
7378700,7380560," Okay."
7380560,7381460," So,"
7381460,7382240," this one looks"
7382240,7382700," interesting."
7382700,7383520," HD."
7383520,7386620," Free download."
7386620,7388040," Yeah,"
7388040,7388500," give me a"
7388500,7388960," small one,"
7388960,7389300," please."
7389300,7392720," Ooh."
7392720,7394220," It downloaded"
7394220,7394640," something."
7394640,7395580," Nice."
7395580,7397120," Move,"
7397120,7397720," download,"
7397720,7398280," pasta."
7398280,7400860," Let's move it"
7400860,7401100," here."
7402680,7403100," Okay."
7403100,7403100," Okay."
7403100,7404140," We got pasta."
7404140,7405260," Oh,"
7405260,7405900," that's nice."
7405900,7406440," Okay."
7406440,7406820," So,"
7406820,7407340," I'm going to"
7407340,7408400," bring the"
7408400,7409520," volume down"
7409520,7410340," because I have no"
7410340,7410960," idea if there's"
7410960,7411700," any sound in that"
7411700,7411920," video."
7411920,7412300," Let's actually"
7412300,7412880," take a look at it."
7412880,7423860," Fuck me."
7423860,7424740," Now I'm hungry."
7426900,7427260," Okay."
7427260,7428940," So,"
7428940,7429680," this looks like a"
7429680,7430440," pretty good website."
7430440,7431680," It says it's public"
7431680,7432020," domain,"
7432020,7432420," I suppose."
7432420,7432780," So,"
7432780,7433620," free for commercial"
7433620,7434040," use,"
7434040,7434640," no attribution"
7434640,7435020," required."
7435020,7435520," Sure."
7435520,7435900," I mean,"
7435900,7436220," okay."
7436220,7436540," So,"
7436540,7437600," we're using it for"
7437600,7438400," even non-commercial"
7438400,7438700," use,"
7438700,7439160," I suppose."
7439160,7440120," But it depends,"
7440120,7440820," depending on how"
7440820,7441240," you view it."
7441240,7442320," So,"
7442320,7442840," source."
7442840,7444140," TXT,"
7444140,7444620," I'm going to put"
7444620,7445340," this thing here"
7445340,7446260," and I'm going to"
7446260,7446980," rename this to"
7446980,7447780," just pasta"
7447780,7448760," for easy"
7448760,7449320," use."
7449320,7451420," And I think"
7451420,7452120," I want to slice"
7452120,7452740," that motherfucker"
7452740,7453840," into PNG"
7453840,7455100," images."
7455300,7455940," I want to slice"
7455940,7456140," it."
7456140,7456940," Okay."
7456940,7457560," So,"
7457560,7459520," FFmpeg"
7459520,7461140," extract frames."
7461140,7464240," Is he about to"
7464240,7465040," double cook the"
7465040,7465380," pasta?"
7465380,7465820," Yes,"
7465820,7467180," he is about to do"
7467180,7467420," that."
7467420,7467940," So,"
7467940,7468840," we do the input"
7468840,7471340," rate one-to-one"
7471340,7472400," and then we turn"
7472400,7473100," it into PNGs."
7473100,7473840," I think this is how"
7473840,7474320," we do that."
7474320,7475640," All right."
7475640,7477400," So,"
7477400,7478060," let's actually create"
7478060,7479520," a separate folder"
7479520,7480960," frames and we're"
7480960,7481340," going to do the"
7481340,7482080," following thing."
7484880,7485560," frames"
7485560,7488200," file name."
7488200,7489260," There are three."
7489260,7490640," I usually go"
7490640,7492000," with four digits"
7492000,7492760," just in case."
7492760,7494280," God damn it."
7494280,7495440," And I lost it."
7495440,7496720," I fucking lost"
7496720,7497200," everything."
7497200,7497760," Okay."
7497760,7499080," Four digits"
7499080,7499900," just in case."
7499900,7501500," PNG"
7501500,7504100," frames"
7504100,7507720," pasta"
7507720,7509220," MP4"
7509220,7511200," and let's just"
7511200,7511740," try to run"
7511740,7512000," that."
7512000,7514300," Okay."
7514300,7516100," Did it create?"
7516100,7516500," Okay."
7516500,7516700," So,"
7516700,7517380," it created some"
7517380,7517820," shit."
7517820,7518900," But"
7518900,7522200," I'm not quite sure"
7522200,7522900," if it created the"
7522900,7523460," right thing"
7523460,7524240," to be fair."
7524240,7526720," So,"
7526720,7527080," let's do"
7527080,7527800," extract"
7527800,7528840," frames"
7528840,7529640," sh."
7529640,7530380," Let's put this"
7530380,7530920," thing here."
7530920,7533220," Maybe I should"
7533220,7533740," actually do"
7533740,7534060," something."
7534200,7534320," well,"
7534320,7534520," I mean,"
7534520,7535020," it kind of"
7535020,7535380," worked"
7535380,7535980," technically"
7535980,7537840," but I'm not"
7537840,7538300," 100%"
7538300,7538860," sure."
7538860,7541960," Maybe we can"
7541960,7542340," even do"
7542340,7542760," something like"
7542760,7543240," this here."
7543240,7543700," Like,"
7543700,7544480," just accept"
7544480,7545500," the first"
7545500,7546020," argument."
7546020,7547820," And this one,"
7547820,7548260," like a"
7548260,7548840," file name."
7548840,7550760," I have a"
7550760,7551260," feeling that"
7551260,7551780," we should"
7551780,7552360," probably do it"
7552360,7552860," like that."
7552860,7554300," Yeah."
7554300,7556800," Yeah."
7556800,7557640," There we go."
7559060,7559340," So,"
7559340,7559960," and let me"
7559960,7560380," do"
7560380,7561140," this kind"
7561140,7561480," of thing."
7561480,7562360," Extract"
7562360,7563480," frames."
7563480,7565540," There we go."
7565540,7566320," No file name"
7566320,7566920," or directory."
7566920,7571760," Let's do it"
7571760,7572140," like that."
7572140,7573280," And also"
7573280,7573960," remove this kind"
7573960,7574180," of shit."
7574180,7574500," I think"
7574500,7575080," this kind"
7575080,7575280," of"
7575280,7576020," command line"
7576020,7576320," is over"
7576320,7576780," complicated."
7576780,7579200," Make"
7579200,7580460," DRP"
7580460,7581500," frames."
7582440,7583240," so that"
7583240,7583820," enables me"
7583820,7584380," with removing"
7584380,7584960," those frames"
7584960,7586240," and I can"
7586240,7586480," do it"
7586480,7586760," one more"
7586760,7587020," time."
7587020,7587680," Could not"
7587680,7588620," find file."
7588620,7591280," Okay."
7591280,7602360," You don't"
7602360,7602820," provide the"
7602820,7603120," file."
7603120,7607380," Okay."
7607380,7607820," So,"
7607820,7608300," I don't quite"
7608300,7609040," understand why"
7609040,7610380," this just"
7610380,7611160," doesn't work"
7611160,7612060," exactly as"
7612060,7612420," I want it"
7612420,7612800," to work."
7612800,7613540," I just"
7613540,7614000," don't quite"
7614000,7614560," understand."
7614560,7617280," Yeah."
7617280,7618040," Minus R is"
7618040,7618540," probably needed."
7618540,7618780," Yeah."
7618780,7619260," This is what"
7619260,7619580," I figured."
7619580,7621560," File name"
7621560,7622100," or maybe"
7622100,7623660," okay."
7623660,7625420," So,"
7625420,7626020," let's try to"
7626020,7626300," do that"
7626300,7626620," one more"
7626620,7626980," time."
7626980,7627740," We can"
7627740,7628500," capillation"
7628500,7629380," extract"
7629380,7629960," frames."
7629960,7631420," No such"
7631420,7631840," file."
7631840,7634040," Ah,"
7634040,7634580," for fuck's"
7634580,7634720," sake."
7634720,7634980," Yes,"
7634980,7635200," yes,"
7635200,7635440," yes."
7635440,7636320," Now I"
7636320,7636600," understand"
7636600,7636860," what you're"
7636860,7637140," talking about."
7637140,7637620," I'm sorry."
7637620,7638040," I'm sorry."
7638040,7638740," I brain farted"
7638740,7639240," so fucking"
7639240,7639500," loud."
7639500,7640820," All right."
7640820,7641840," And it"
7641840,7642320," didn't work"
7642320,7642660," correctly."
7642660,7642940," So,"
7642940,7643600," this is not"
7643600,7643940," one."
7643940,7645180," It's rather"
7645180,7645980," this kind"
7645980,7646400," of thing."
7646400,7648860," File name."
7648860,7649320," I suppose"
7649320,7649820," this is a"
7649820,7650480," thing of"
7650480,7652140," that shit."
7652140,7653260," Come on,"
7653260,7654080," just shut up"
7654080,7654340," already."
7654340,7655460," Uh-huh."
7655460,7656600," And I"
7656600,7657860," cannot believe,"
7657860,7659400," to be fair,"
7659400,7660680," I just cannot"
7660680,7661200," believe"
7661200,7663360," that"
7663360,7664960," this is it."
7664960,7665480," This is why"
7665480,7665900," I was trying"
7665900,7666440," to get rid of"
7666440,7667080," the minus R"
7667080,7668620," because I"
7668620,7669160," have more"
7669160,7669680," frames than"
7669680,7669960," that."
7669960,7670200," I mean,"
7670200,7670840," come on."
7670840,7672080," This is,"
7672080,7672740," like,"
7672740,7673440," I do have"
7673440,7674120," more frames."
7674120,7675440," I do,"
7675440,7675760," in fact,"
7675760,7676300," have more."
7676300,7677220," So,"
7677220,7680460," um,"
7680460,7682520," yes,"
7682520,7682880," I know"
7682880,7683260," that you're"
7683260,7683640," supposed to"
7683640,7684060," use double"
7684060,7684460," quotes."
7684460,7684880," I was"
7684880,7685260," checking"
7685260,7685640," whether"
7685640,7687080," dollar"
7687080,7687860," file name"
7687860,7688560," is a thing"
7688560,7689880," of ffmpeg,"
7689880,7691240," urpppeg,"
7691240,7691560," chat."
7691560,7692520," Right."
7692520,7693340," This is how"
7693340,7693680," we check."
7693680,7693860," So,"
7693860,7694220," how do"
7694220,7694640," you check"
7694640,7694880," that"
7694880,7695740," dollar"
7695740,7696340," file name"
7696340,7697180," is maybe"
7697180,7697620," some sort"
7697620,7698040," of a feature"
7698040,7698760," of ffmpeg?"
7698760,7699620," You put"
7699620,7700540," one quotes"
7700540,7700860," there."
7700860,7702100," No,"
7702100,7702600," if you put"
7702600,7703240," double quotes"
7703240,7703540," there,"
7703540,7704120," it will try"
7704120,7704320," to,"
7704320,7705400," like,"
7705400,7706460," substitute it"
7706460,7706920," on the bash"
7706920,7707200," level,"
7707200,7708220," not ffmpeg."
7708220,7708940," You are"
7708940,7709340," preparing to"
7709340,7709540," chat."
7709540,7709940," You don't"
7709940,7710420," even understand"
7710420,7710720," what I'm"
7710720,7711080," trying to"
7711080,7711280," do."
7711280,7712600," Jesus"
7712600,7712960," fucking"
7712960,7713220," Christ,"
7713220,7713560," people."
7713560,7717740," Oh,"
7717740,7718160," my God."
7718160,7722640," It's"
7722640,7723080," unbelievable"
7723080,7723360," how"
7723360,7723540," people"
7723540,7723860," are."
7723860,7725940," Because,"
7725940,7726220," I mean,"
7726220,7726740," this is"
7726740,7726980," probably"
7726980,7727420," how it"
7727420,7727660," works."
7727660,7728260," I was"
7728260,7728500," thinking"
7728500,7728760," maybe"
7728760,7728960," it"
7728960,7729140," just"
7729140,7729500," refers"
7729500,7729700," to"
7729700,7729920," this"
7729920,7730260," kind"
7730260,7730380," of"
7730380,7730540," thing"
7730540,7730700," that"
7730700,7730860," is"
7730860,7731120," here."
7731120,7733180," All right."
7733180,7733960," So,"
7733960,7735000," I cannot believe"
7735000,7735540," that this is"
7735540,7735880," how many"
7735880,7736280," frames you"
7736280,7736460," have."
7736460,7736620," Like,"
7736620,7737040," I thought"
7737040,7737300," that there"
7737300,7737420," is"
7737420,7737760," more."
7737760,7739320," And,"
7739320,7739960," look at"
7739960,7740140," that,"
7740140,7740400," look at"
7740400,7740740," that chat."
7740740,7742760," Look at"
7742760,7743120," how many"
7743120,7743460," frames"
7743460,7743960," it has."
7743960,7746180," All right."
7746180,7748500," I think"
7748500,7749120," this is,"
7749120,7749520," like,"
7749520,7750880," why is"
7750880,7751420," this a"
7751420,7752080," one-to-one"
7752080,7752520," and why"
7752520,7753100," they're so"
7753100,7753780," small?"
7753780,7755860," One frame"
7755860,7756460," per second."
7756460,7757500," This is why"
7757500,7757880," I was trying"
7757880,7758320," to get rid"
7758320,7758620," of that"
7758620,7758880," shit."
7758880,7759420," Yes,"
7759420,7759980," because,"
7759980,7760520," could you"
7760520,7761420," just extract"
7761420,7762020," that information"
7762020,7762600," from that"
7762600,7762900," place?"
7762900,7763520," Oh,"
7763520,7763780," yeah,"
7763780,7764980," and we"
7764980,7765520," never"
7765520,7765900," actually"
7765900,7766420," tried this"
7766420,7766800," shit like"
7766800,7767080," that."
7769740,7770520," sh-mode"
7770520,7770560," sh-mode."
7770560,7771400," There we go."
7771400,7774800," Oh,"
7774800,7775220," now it's"
7775220,7775460," working."
7775460,7775820," Now it's"
7775820,7776420," extracting all"
7776420,7776620," of the"
7776620,7776900," frames."
7776900,7778100," Yeah,"
7778100,7778480," boy."
7778480,7780060," Yeah."
7780060,7781120," Okay."
7781120,7782020," So,"
7782020,7782600," let me remove"
7782600,7783060," that one more"
7783060,7784360," time and"
7784360,7785660," make it"
7785660,7786100," appropriate."
7786100,7787160," Like,"
7787160,7787540," something like"
7787540,7787720," this."
7787720,7788040," I think"
7788040,7788740," something like"
7788740,7789180," this will be"
7789180,7789540," okay."
7789540,7790420," And let's"
7790420,7790980," try to run it"
7790980,7791480," one more time."
7791480,7792040," So,"
7792040,7792240," finally,"
7792240,7792760," we will be"
7792760,7793140," able to"
7793140,7793680," extract all the"
7793680,7793880," frames."
7794880,7796960," I have no"
7796960,7797360," idea what"
7797360,7797880," it was"
7797880,7798960," 1 slash"
7798960,7799320," 1,"
7799320,7800000," whatever,"
7800000,7800840," fucking"
7800840,7801380," useless"
7801380,7801600," piece."
7801600,7802620," I rerun it"
7802620,7803220," in one more"
7803220,7803380," time,"
7803380,7803740," but okay."
7803740,7804640," It's totally"
7804640,7804900," okay."
7804900,7806560," Okay,"
7806560,7807080," here are all"
7807080,7807540," of the frames."
7807540,7807900," We have"
7807900,7808820," 300 frames."
7808820,7809680," We have"
7809680,7810120," literally"
7810120,7811160," 300 frames."
7811160,7811660," Here are"
7811660,7812060," the frames"
7812060,7812360," and we"
7812360,7812660," should be"
7812660,7813320," able to"
7813320,7814460," extract"
7814460,7814860," all of"
7814860,7815000," these"
7815000,7815420," beautiful,"
7815420,7815860," beautiful"
7815860,7816380," frames."
7816380,7818380," Epic."
7818380,7819220," Absolutely"
7819220,7819740," fucking"
7819740,7820000," epic."
7820000,7820620," So,"
7820620,7820980," one of the"
7820980,7821280," things I"
7821280,7821560," want to be"
7821560,7821860," able to"
7821860,7821980," do,"
7821980,7822260," I want"
7822260,7822440," to be"
7822440,7822980," able to"
7822980,7823540," read"
7823540,7824780," the"
7824780,7825340," files"
7825340,7826180," from"
7826180,7826940," the"
7826940,7827260," system."
7827260,7833620," Yeah."
7833620,7834860," So,"
7834860,7835320," I need"
7835320,7835640," to,"
7835640,7836480," yeah,"
7836480,7836780," I'm just"
7836780,7837720," thinking how"
7837720,7838120," I'm going"
7838120,7838360," to do"
7838360,7838620," that."
7838620,7840480," So,"
7840480,7840780," the only"
7840780,7841140," thing I"
7841140,7841400," need to"
7841400,7842040," keep track"
7842040,7843040," of is"
7843040,7845200," buffer"
7845200,7846720," of bytes,"
7846720,7847660," right,"
7847660,7848760," just a"
7848760,7849000," buffer"
7849000,7849500," of bytes"
7849500,7851000," and"
7851000,7852420," the"
7852420,7852900," output"
7852900,7853120," in"
7853120,7853400," form,"
7853400,7854460," right,"
7854680,7855000," this is"
7855000,7855140," the"
7855140,7855340," only"
7855340,7855580," thing"
7855580,7855740," I"
7855740,7855940," have"
7855940,7856240," to"
7856240,7857440," care"
7857440,7857860," about."
7857860,7861840," Because"
7861840,7862540," of that,"
7862540,7863600," I think"
7863600,7864020," it's"
7864020,7864560," time to"
7864560,7865100," allocate,"
7865100,7866020," to define"
7866020,7866420," some sort"
7866420,7866640," of a"
7866640,7867080," structure,"
7867080,7868120," right,"
7868120,7868580," to define"
7868580,7868900," some sort"
7868900,7869080," of a"
7869080,7869340," structure,"
7869340,7869540," let's"
7869540,7869780," try to"
7869780,7869900," do"
7869900,7870200," that."
7870200,7871940," Enjoy"
7871940,7872200," reading"
7872200,7872500," files"
7872500,7872620," in"
7872620,7872760," us."
7872760,7872960," Yeah,"
7872960,7873160," yeah,"
7873160,7873680," I know"
7873680,7874080," that it's"
7874080,7874240," going to"
7874240,7874420," be"
7874420,7874920," like a"
7874920,7875500," fucking"
7875500,7875840," pain in"
7875840,7875940," the"
7875940,7876120," ass,"
7876120,7876300," but"
7876300,7876760," it"
7876760,7876880," is"
7876880,7877000," what"
7877000,7877120," it"
7877120,7877320," is."
7877320,7878240," And"
7878240,7878340," it"
7878340,7878540," isn't"
7878540,7878700," what"
7878700,7878800," it"
7878800,7878920," is."
7878920,7879140," so"
7879140,7879320," we're"
7879320,7879360," going"
7879360,7879400," to"
7879400,7879540," have"
7879540,7879680," a"
7879680,7880000," frame"
7880000,7880780," which"
7880780,7881260," is"
7881260,7881780," probably"
7881780,7882000," going"
7882000,7882140," to"
7882140,7882560," store"
7882560,7883340," pixels"
7883340,7884960," in"
7884960,7885740," some"
7885740,7885940," sort"
7885940,7886020," of"
7886020,7886480," vector,"
7886480,7887100," right,"
7887100,7887580," this is"
7887580,7887880," how you"
7887880,7888020," do"
7888020,7888420," vectors,"
7888420,7888680," right,"
7888680,7888860," so"
7888860,7889040," this"
7889040,7889140," is"
7889140,7889280," the"
7889280,7889560," vector,"
7889560,7890640," and"
7890640,7891200," this"
7891200,7891640," frame"
7891640,7892320," is"
7892320,7892640," going"
7892640,7892900," to"
7892900,7893420," own"
7893420,7893840," those"
7893840,7894240," pixels,"
7894240,7894940," this"
7894940,7895040," is"
7895040,7895200," quite"
7895200,7895560," important,"
7895560,7896020," this"
7896020,7896340," thing"
7896340,7897060," owns"
7897060,7897360," them,"
7897360,7898260," all right,"
7898260,7899600," so I"
7899600,7899920," suppose"
7899920,7900340," you cannot"
7900340,7900880," just use"
7900880,7901220," vector"
7901220,7901780," like that,"
7901780,7902180," you have"
7902180,7902300," to"
7902300,7902960," pre-initialize"
7902960,7903300," it with"
7903300,7903600," vector"
7903600,7904000," new"
7904000,7904240," or"
7904240,7904660," something,"
7904660,7905000," right,"
7905000,7905380," this is"
7905380,7905520," what"
7905520,7905620," you"
7905620,7905780," had"
7905780,7905900," to"
7905900,7906100," do,"
7906100,7908100," I'm"
7908100,7908320," totally"
7908320,7908520," okay"
7908520,7908700," with"
7908700,7908900," that,"
7908900,7909560," we'll"
7909560,7909720," see"
7909720,7909880," how"
7909880,7909980," it"
7909980,7910220," goes,"
7910220,7911140," and"
7911140,7912380," the"
7912380,7912700," info"
7912700,7912960," about"
7912960,7913120," the"
7913120,7913400," pixels,"
7913400,7913980," so"
7913980,7914460," output"
7914460,7914900," info,"
7914900,7917100," output"
7917100,7918240," info,"
7918240,7918860," hopefully"
7918860,7919140," I"
7919560,7919920," to,"
7919920,7921040," yeah,"
7921040,7921600," output info"
7921600,7921940," is just"
7921940,7922840," pretty much"
7922840,7924200," structure,"
7924200,7924940," so I"
7924940,7925300," should be"
7925300,7925680," able to"
7925680,7925960," simply"
7925960,7926460," own it,"
7926460,7927760," I should"
7927760,7928060," be able"
7928060,7928240," to"
7928240,7928520," simply"
7928520,7929000," own it."
7929000,7931040," Do I"
7931040,7931560," need to"
7931560,7932300," implement"
7932300,7932660," the"
7932660,7933160," constructor"
7933160,7933560," for this"
7933560,7933800," frame,"
7933800,7934100," what do"
7934100,7934220," you guys"
7934220,7934480," think?"
7934480,7935060," Do I"
7935060,7935360," need to"
7935360,7935560," have"
7935560,7935860," something"
7935860,7936160," like"
7936160,7936560," this"
7936560,7938120," that"
7938120,7938560," will"
7938560,7939560," return"
7939560,7939980," you"
7939980,7943060," pixels?"
7943060,7945260," I"
7945260,7945520," don't"
7945520,7945740," think"
7945740,7946020," so,"
7946020,7946340," I'm"
7946340,7946580," not"
7946580,7946820," quite"
7946820,7947140," sure,"

8027680,8028740," I"

8035100,8036340," So"
8036340,8037340," here's"
8037340,8037540," what we're"

8041640,8041920," I"

8043240,8043740," You"
8043740,8043920," see"

8048960,8049980," Because"

8050280,8050380," I"

8057240,8060880," I"
8060880,8061200," think"
8061200,8064380," this"
8064380,8064620," is what"
8064620,8064780," time"
8064780,8065120," displacement."
8065120,8066420," So"
8066420,8066720," there's"
8066720,8067260," example"
8067260,8068020," in the"
8068020,8069100," project"

8070500,8071420," So"
8071420,8071720," we're"

8074900,8075060," it"
8075060,8075200," will"
8075200,8075480," work"
8075480,8076100," algorithmically"
8076100,8076360," because"
8076360,8076540," I'm"
8076540,8076720," kind"

8078700,8079180," if"

8079940,8080520," All"

8080680,8081760," So"
8081760,8082220," you"
8082220,8082340," could"
8082340,8082620," implement"

8083420,8083580," It"

8086840,8088680," Okay."
8088680,8089840," So"
8089840,8090040," I"
8090040,8090300," want to"

8098600,8099400," All"

8099600,8100080," So"
8100080,8100300," let's"
8100300,8100540," define"

8344580,8344820," new"
8344820,8345180," okay"
8345180,8349560," with"
8349560,8350220," capacity"
8350220,8351000," cool"
8351000,8352540," all right"
8352540,8353960," chats"
8353960,8356240," does anybody"
8356240,8356600," know"
8356600,8357740," I think"
8357740,8359420," ah you may not"
8359420,8360780," actually know that up front"
8360780,8362040," yeah this is kind of a problem"
8362040,8364040," you cannot know that up front"
8364040,8365920," you just cannot"
8365920,8372620," and because of that we'll probably want to do it like a little bit later"
8372620,8377420," okay so we prepare this kind of thing and this is where we're going to allocate"
8377420,8378100," that frame"
8378100,8379560," uh yep"
8379560,8381020," in four"
8381020,8383740," yeah this one is pixels"
8383740,8388100," in four is in four and I think this is pretty much it"
8388100,8389660," um"
8389660,8390480," now"
8390480,8392660," what I can do"
8392660,8394720," I can do frames"
8394720,8395920," uh"
8395920,8396960," resize"
8396960,8398200," info"
8398200,8400020," buffer size"
8400020,8401560," and frame"
8401560,8402580," like I damn it"
8402580,8403400," in frames"
8403400,8404760," in um"
8404760,8406500," do I need to do anything else"
8406500,8407200," I don't think so"
8407200,8407980," I think that is it"
8407980,8408800," uh"
8408800,8409180," all right"
8409180,8409700," and if I"
8409700,8411120," do this kind of stuff"
8411120,8412400," I can try to do"
8412400,8413240," frame"
8413240,8414200," pixels"
8414200,8416240," and then unwrap that"
8416240,8418980," then we can try to rotate"
8418980,8420060," frame"
8420060,8421260," pixels"
8421260,8423020," so we're going to rotate it"
8423020,8424060," um"
8424060,8426440," and then we can save"
8426440,8427540," frame"
8427540,8428660," pixels"
8428660,8429280," like so"
8429280,8431020," will that"
8431020,8431940," work"
8431940,8433620," will that work"
8433620,8434860," that's a good question"
8434860,8437140," will that even compile"
8437140,8438200," let's find out"
8438200,8440400," uh"
8440400,8441200," it doesn't compile"
8441200,8441960," uh"
8441960,8442440," frames"
8442440,8444700," frame"
8444700,8445660," pixels"
8445660,8446800," resize"
8446800,8448780," okay"
8448780,8450420," um"
8450420,8451840," expected two parameters"
8451840,8453420," so what does it take"
8453420,8454160," it takes"
8454160,8454680," I mean"
8454680,8456780," didn't I provide it to parameters already"
8456780,8457100," I mean"
8457100,8457460," uh"
8457460,8457800," there's"
8457800,8458380," okay"
8458380,8460260," resize"
8460260,8465560," oh you have to provide the initial value"
8465560,8466220," okay I see"
8466220,8468300," okay"
8468300,8469060," what's next one"
8469060,8469940," um"
8469940,8470980," so we don't have"
8470980,8471500," bit"
8471500,8472480," uh"
8472480,8473540," it's a frame"
8473540,8474500," info"
8474500,8475380," color type"
8475380,8476880," what else do we have"
8476880,8477620," uh"
8477620,8478220," and here"
8478220,8479560," we'll have to do frame"
8479560,8480260," info"
8480260,8481000," blah blah blah"
8481000,8483340," frame"
8483340,8484320," info"
8484320,8484940," buffer size"
8484940,8487220," that's"
8487220,8488440," okay"
8488440,8489260," come on"
8489260,8489600," come on"
8489600,8489820," come on"
8489820,8490140," come on"
8490140,8490420," cool"
8490420,8491160," so"
8491160,8491940," uh"
8491940,8493720," overall it works"
8493720,8494760," let's see"
8494760,8495600," I mean compiles"
8495600,8496540," but as you know"
8496540,8497200," if it compiles"
8497200,8497660," it works"
8497660,8498600," we get a raid"
8498600,8499540," we get a raid"
8499540,8500200," excuse me"
8500200,8500880," where's the raid"
8500880,8503340," I don't see any raids"
8503340,8506580," uh"
8506580,8508380," oh we have seven raiders from Nuffly"
8508380,8509200," hello hello Nuffly"
8509200,8510640," hello hello welcome welcome to the gym"
8510640,8513240," um"
8513240,8514520," raid shadow legends"
8514520,8515540," yes I'm sponsored"
8515540,8516360," sponsored by them"
8516360,8517500," uh"
8517500,8517820," okay"
8517820,8519300," now I'm gonna remove"
8519300,8520460," uh remove output png"
8520460,8521960," I'm gonna remove output png"
8521960,8523000," and I'm gonna uh"
8523000,8523980," just do cargo build"
8523980,8525260," and maybe cargo run"
8525260,8525880," I suppose"
8525880,8526720," let's just run it"
8526720,8527760," and if I take a look at that"
8527760,8528400," it's reverted"
8528400,8529140," so everything"
8529140,8530160," works"
8530160,8530780," correctly"
8530780,8532120," all right"
8532120,8533120," the thing I wanted to do"
8533120,8534480," I maybe wanted to"
8534480,8535860," uh"
8535860,8536760," implement it"
8536760,8537680," not like that"
8537680,8538500," but rather as"
8538500,8539700," rotate image"
8539700,8540440," right"
8540440,8541840," rather as"
8541840,8542740," rotate image"
8542740,8545780," mm-hmm"
8545780,8546920," I think that would be interesting"
8546920,8548140," uh"
8548140,8548520," maybe"
8548520,8550680," I'm gonna even put that"
8550680,8551700," into the implementation"
8551700,8552940," I think it would be actually"
8552940,8553440," pretty good"
8553440,8554120," pretty epic"
8554120,8557540," uh"
8557540,8558340," so for example"
8558340,8560200," yeah we can make all of that"
8560200,8561480," methods of the frame"
8561480,8563200," because it kind of makes sense"
8563200,8565460," because output info"
8565460,8566540," and pixels"
8566540,8568140," they want to go together"
8568140,8569920," this is the thing that they do"
8569920,8570980," they want to go together"
8570980,8572460," and uh"
8572460,8573540," what we can implement here"
8573540,8574960," we can implement frame"
8574960,8576220," and uh"
8576220,8576680," basically"
8576680,8579240," um"
8579240,8582120," accept"
8582120,8583240," uh"
8583240,8584280," pixels"
8584280,8585080," pixel index"
8585080,8585480," let's go"
8585480,8586280," place this thing here"
8586280,8587480," um"
8587480,8588600," specifically here"
8588600,8589120," chat"
8589120,8590200," specifically here"
8590200,8591560," we don't have to accept info"
8591560,8593240," because info is a part of self"
8593240,8594520," so we can do something like"
8594520,8595520," uh"
8595520,8596120," self"
8596120,8597540," row size"
8597540,8598740," and info"
8598740,8599660," is essentially"
8599660,8600300," self"
8600300,8600840," info"
8600840,8601320," so"
8601320,8602440," something like this"
8602440,8604040," so now we have a pixel index"
8604040,8605480," um"
8605480,8606500," and"
8606500,8610520," then we can just do that"
8610520,8614540," and since we already have a context"
8614540,8615240," within where"
8615240,8616460," which we are operating"
8616460,8618300," we don't have to say rotate image"
8618300,8619240," we can just call it rotate"
8619240,8620960," and we don't have to even"
8620960,8622560," accept anything here"
8622560,8623400," I think"
8623400,8625080," we don't have to accept anything"
8625080,8626040," uh"
8626040,8627620," because all the necessary information"
8627620,8628640," is located"
8628640,8630340," within self"
8630340,8632040," this is where it's located"
8632040,8633380," it's located within self"
8633380,8634600," uh"
8634600,8636500," so now we can do self"
8636500,8637300," here"
8637300,8638500," uh"
8638500,8639020," then"
8639020,8640340," self height"
8640340,8641700," self width"
8641700,8642520," uh"
8642520,8644060," do I need to do self pixel index"
8644060,8646020," I think I do have to use self pixel index"
8646020,8648140," is self mandatory by the way"
8648140,8649740," is self mandatory"
8649740,8651660," I think it is mandatory"
8651660,8652820," so it's almost like python"
8652820,8653940," I would even say that"
8653940,8655260," rust is basically python"
8655260,8655780," right"
8655780,8657220," so it's basically python"
8657220,8660580," in case of this kind of thing"
8660580,8660940," right"
8660940,8661740," self pixel"
8661740,8663940," we don't have to provide in for anymore"
8663940,8665140," because yeah"
8665140,8666140," it's just that"
8666140,8668680," uh"
8668680,8669400," it's just that"
8669400,8670380," and then we can"
8670380,8671880," oh this one is interesting"
8671880,8673700," so we'll have to do it like so"
8673700,8674780," uh"
8674780,8676760," self"
8676760,8678140," pixels"
8678140,8679140," swap"
8679140,8681120," and I'm not sure"
8681120,8682620," if it's gonna work like that"
8682620,8683940," maybe it will work like that"
8683940,8685340," we will see"
8685340,8686080," we will see"
8686080,8687800," so this is basically"
8687800,8688080," I"
8688080,8688880," how I wanna"
8688880,8689960," sort of extract"
8689960,8691260," this particular entity"
8691260,8692480," uh"
8692480,8693580," which will enable me"
8693580,8695280," with some interesting stuff"
8695280,8696760," I still wanna introduce"
8696760,8697460," a constructor"
8697460,8698340," let me uh"
8698340,8699160," demonstrate you how"
8699160,8700460," I wanna introduce the constructor"
8700460,8701400," um"
8701400,8702420," so we're gonna do"
8702420,8703320," new"
8703320,8704680," uh"
8704680,8706520," and we're gonna accept"
8706520,8707180," info"
8707180,8709180," we're gonna accept"
8709180,8709840," this info"
8709840,8710320," by"
8710320,8711500," a reference"
8711500,8712560," or maybe by a value"
8712560,8712920," I'm"
8712920,8714040," I have not decided yet"
8714040,8714400," but"
8714400,8715420," uh"
8715420,8716420," what we'll have to construct"
8716420,8717500," we'll have to construct"
8717500,8718900," the result"
8718900,8720280," which is gonna be"
8720280,8721360," just a frame"
8721360,8723100," um"
8723100,8724760," maybe I can just do"
8724760,8726400," let's construct pixels first"
8726400,8727000," pixels"
8727000,8728020," uh"
8728020,8728520," vec"
8728520,8729320," u"
8729320,8730520," uh"
8730520,8731280," I probably have to do"
8731280,8732520," shit like u8"
8732520,8733600," because I'm not sure"
8733600,8734720," if it will be able to"
8734720,8735700," uh"
8735700,8736220," properly"
8736220,8736940," um"
8736940,8737960," infer the type"
8737960,8740220," um"
8740220,8741920," infer the type"
8741920,8742320," and"
8742320,8743140," uh"
8743140,8744340," what I wanna say"
8744340,8745060," I wanna"
8745060,8746600," resize this thing"
8746600,8747520," according to"
8747520,8748320," whatever size"
8748320,8749120," we are expecting"
8749120,8749620," right"
8749620,8750360," so we are doing"
8750360,8751280," this kind of resize"
8751280,8752420," right"
8752420,8753020," so"
8753020,8753800," yeah"
8753800,8755360," this is how I'm gonna do that"
8755360,8757220," um"
8757220,8758300," I think"
8758300,8760320," I think I should have used"
8760320,8760800," vec"
8760800,8761560," uh"
8761560,8762700," vec"
8762700,8763660," macro"
8763660,8765180," this is what it feels like"
8765180,8765900," I think the vec"
8765900,8767220," macro is specifically for that"
8767220,8768360," let me actually read about it"
8768360,8769340," uh"
8769340,8770260," yeah"
8770260,8772040," contiguous"
8772040,8773700," growable array type"
8773700,8774340," with the heap"
8774340,8775280," allocated constants"
8775280,8776120," written vec"
8776120,8777380," uh"
8777380,8778000," vector have"
8778000,8779240," one indexing"
8779240,8780400," amortize one push"
8780400,8781980," and one pop"
8781980,8782260," okay"
8782260,8783160," that's understandable"
8783160,8784660," um"
8784660,8786420," you can explicitly create"
8786420,8787060," uh"
8787060,8787920," ten zeros"
8787920,8789960," I think this is what I want"
8789960,8790280," chat"
8790280,8791620," I think this is what I want"
8791620,8792140," in my life"
8792140,8792960," so"
8792960,8794360," basically what I want to return"
8794360,8795040," I want to return"
8795040,8795880," self"
8795880,8797160," pixels"
8797160,8798480," where pixels are"
8798480,8798980," vec"
8798980,8800380," uh"
8800380,8801520," where is the count"
8801520,8802140," zero"
8802140,8803320," uh"
8803320,8804780," buffer size"
8804780,8806560," but it's rather info"
8806560,8807480," buffer size"
8807480,8809040," and here I'm gonna move"
8809040,8810560," info inside of this thing"
8810560,8811560," uh"
8811560,8812560," yeah"
8812560,8814040," and since I will move info"
8814040,8814800," inside of that thing"
8814800,8816340," I won't be able to reuse it anymore"
8816340,8818120," so that actually makes so much sense"
8818120,8820160," and I should be able to do"
8820160,8820880," this kind of shit"
8820880,8821160," look"
8821160,8822640," so I'm allocating the frame"
8822640,8823700," instead of doing that shit"
8823700,8824700," I'm gonna do new"
8824700,8825960," and info"
8825960,8828340," and I don't have to resize anything"
8828340,8829560," and"
8829560,8830740," then I can"
8830740,8831420," simply"
8831420,8833420," uh"
8833420,8836240," provide these pixels there"
8836240,8836740," then"
8836740,8837760," I go and"
8837760,8838740," rotate"
8838740,8840260," this entire thing"
8840260,8842400," I just rotate this entire thing"
8842400,8843840," and then I'll have to create an encoder"
8843840,8844760," uh"
8844760,8845080," info"
8845080,8845720," blah blah blah"
8845720,8846860," and"
8846860,8848560," I think that will work"
8848560,8850580," I think that will actually work"
8850580,8851420," so"
8851420,8852000," yeah"
8852000,8852820," there we go"
8852820,8854200," uh"
8854200,8857200," will that work chat"
8857200,8858100," please see bets"
8858100,8859200," you can do self"
8859200,8859880," info"
8859880,8860760," info instead of"
8860760,8861340," self"
8861340,8862360," info"
8862360,8863860," but I also need"
8863860,8865080," to do pixels here"
8865080,8866360," I mean I don't know"
8866360,8868820," um"
8868820,8870260," okay"
8870260,8870900," so"
8870900,8872500," let's try to compile that"
8872500,8873620," and see if it works or not"
8873620,8874400," it doesn't compile"
8874400,8875380," because what do we have"
8875380,8876260," uh"
8876260,8877920," you don't have to pass that information anymore"
8877920,8878320," yes"
8878320,8878920," agreed"
8878920,8879580," I do"
8879580,8880940," agree with you"
8880940,8882580," info height"
8882580,8882820," oh"
8882820,8883540," this is because it's"
8883540,8884780," self info height"
8884780,8886840," and"
8886840,8887180," uh"
8887180,8888020," this is a self"
8888020,8888380," uh"
8888380,8889340," well it depends"
8889340,8890860," expected"
8890860,8892260," u8"
8892260,8893100," uh"
8893100,8893940," I see"
8893940,8897260," chat it compiled"
8897260,8899060," so now we have"
8899060,8900860," a self-contained entity frame"
8900860,8904200," a self-contained entity frame"
8904200,8905760," uh"
8905760,8906440," which we can"
8906440,8907040," you know"
8907040,8908200," now we can reason about"
8908200,8908880," these kind of things"
8908880,8909800," like on a high level"
8909800,8910780," level or something"
8910780,8912680," so now we can allocate"
8912680,8913960," like a vector of frames"
8913960,8915140," and"
8915140,8915800," um"
8915800,8918200," maybe you should be able to"
8918200,8918960," uh"
8918960,8921520," load that frame"
8921520,8923260," from a file"
8923260,8924140," so"
8924140,8924820," like some"
8924820,8925760," some sort of a path"
8925760,8927000," and it will return the self"
8927000,8927780," and"
8927780,8929800," we'll move this entire shit"
8929800,8931020," inside of the frame"
8931020,8931460," right"
8931460,8932720," you will be able to load file"
8932720,8933820," then you will be able to"
8933820,8934340," save"
8934340,8935400," um"
8935400,8936280," save frame"
8936280,8937540," and so on and so forth"
8937540,8938460," this kind of makes sense"
8938460,8940180," uh"
8940180,8940900," this kind of makes sense"
8940900,8941140," well"
8941140,8942620," this is going to be the next step"
8942620,8943500," that we're going to do chat"
8943500,8944620," this is going to be the next step"
8944620,8946160," first I want to double check"
8946160,8947200," if it works or not"
8947200,8948680," so we're constantly checking"
8948680,8949740," if it works or not"
8949740,8950880," all right"
8950880,8952540," and let's uh"
8952540,8953420," run this thing"
8953420,8955140," seems to be working"
8955140,8957060," and we rotated this entire thing"
8957060,8957600," beautiful"
8957600,8958740," all right"
8958740,8960820," let's move this thing into load"
8960820,8962200," and this thing into save"
8962200,8963580," I think that makes sense"
8963580,8963580," I think that makes sense"
8963580,8964720," um"
8964720,8965320," another thing"
8965320,8966660," I don't like this"
8966660,8968440," self extravaganza"
8968440,8971800," so I want to introduce the following thing"
8971800,8974320," self info width"
8974320,8977700," self info height"
8977700,8980520," so let's go ahead"
8980520,8980960," and"
8980960,8982960," maybe replace"
8982960,8986140," self info height"
8986140,8988400," height"
8988400,8988460," height"
8988460,8989260," with h"
8989260,8990040," boom"
8990040,8991400," similarly"
8991400,8993380," replace"
8993380,8994660," self info"
8994660,8995540," width"
8995540,8996580," with w"
8996580,8997560," boom"
8997560,8999300," and maybe"
8999300,9000460," we can"
9000460,9001220," actually"
9001220,9002520," do as you size"
9002520,9004720," as you size"
9004720,9005980," and"
9005980,9006840," finally"
9006840,9007640," get rid"
9007640,9008140," of this"
9008140,9008640," pass queue"
9008640,9009080," size"
9009080,9010520," and"
9010520,9011000," actually"
9011000,9011920," simplify the code"
9011920,9015520," looks good"
9015520,9015940," looks good"
9015940,9016760," I think it looks good"
9016760,9017460," yeah"
9017460,9019760," is this code readable"
9019760,9020580," I think it's readable"
9020580,9021540," I think it's as readable"
9021540,9022280," as it can get"
9022280,9025660," I heard my name"
9025660,9026460," hello the pesky potato"
9026460,9027860," no I wasn't talking about you"
9027860,9029320," I was talking about"
9029320,9030260," a different pesky thing"
9030260,9031820," uh"
9031820,9033200," there's also a public in Rust"
9033200,9033900," instruct method"
9033900,9034320," yeah yeah"
9034320,9035980," there's a lot of OOP shit in Rust"
9035980,9036700," so yeah"
9036700,9038360," OOP is kind of like"
9038360,9040240," corrupted our programming culture"
9040240,9041240," for decades"
9041240,9042260," and we won't be able"
9042260,9042900," to get rid of it"
9042900,9043340," ever"
9043340,9045160," maybe someday"
9045160,9045820," but I mean"
9045820,9047000," it's definitely corrupted us"
9047000,9048660," so there's nothing"
9048660,9049380," we can do about that"
9049380,9050040," at this point"
9050040,9051940," um"
9051940,9052640," all right"
9052640,9055380," so"
9055380,9056420," um"
9056420,9058820," you know what I want to do"
9058820,9062040," uh"
9062040,9065640," so let's implement load"
9065640,9066720," first of all"
9066720,9068100," did I check that this shit compiles"
9068100,9069660," it in fact compiles"
9069660,9070060," beautiful"
9070060,9071220," uh"
9071220,9072160," a fan load"
9072160,9074060," and I'll have to provide the file path"
9074060,9074460," right"
9074460,9077100," so I do remember that there is sort of a path"
9077100,9078700," type in Rust"
9078700,9079780," but I'm not quite sure"
9079780,9082640," so let me try to find it"
9082640,9084160," um"
9084160,9085480," path"
9085480,9087180," do you have any path"
9087180,9088980," yes it does in fact has path"
9088980,9090080," uh"
9090080,9090360," have"
9090360,9090740," I mean"
9090740,9091820," and it's located here"
9091820,9093200," let's actually take it from here"
9093200,9094000," I suppose it's"
9094000,9096900," it acts like string"
9096900,9099460," it's supposed to be sort of like"
9099460,9100880," a little bit more type save string"
9100880,9102360," that indicates the intent"
9102360,9104500," of opening the file"
9104500,9105580," right"
9105580,9108260," it indicates the intent of opening the file"
9108260,9110520," all right"
9110520,9112360," so uh"
9112360,9113500," we create the decoder"
9113500,9115460," and instead of doing this kind of thing"
9115460,9115920," I put"
9115920,9116320," did I"
9116320,9116960," wait a second"
9116960,9118980," did I remove the code from down below"
9118980,9120040," no I didn't"
9120040,9120660," which is nice"
9120660,9122040," uh"
9122040,9124160," so it's quite important to keep that code there"
9124160,9125540," so we're opening the file"
9125540,9126700," path"
9126700,9127660," and here"
9127660,9129280," do I really want to unwrap that shit"
9129280,9131120," do I really want to unwrap that"
9131120,9132420," I think in this particular case"
9132420,9133760," I want to just return result"
9133760,9135020," uh"
9135020,9135760," result"
9135760,9137380," self"
9137380,9139380," um"
9139380,9140700," or"
9140700,9141920," some sort of error"
9141920,9143200," and"
9143200,9143900," I'm not even sure"
9143900,9144160," we're gonna"
9144160,9145260," we can do it like that"
9145260,9145540," din"
9145540,9146400," uh"
9146400,9146720," error"
9146720,9147920," this is how we're gonna do that"
9147920,9149780," so I think in this particular case"
9149780,9151720," it kind of makes sense to do it like that"
9151720,9153020," um"
9153020,9155020," but we'll see"
9155020,9155440," we'll see"
9155440,9157800," uh"
9157800,9158400," frame"
9158400,9160400," then we allocate a new frame here"
9160400,9161900," and then we read the next frame"
9161900,9163500," and then we can return that frame"
9163500,9164460," I think"
9164460,9165360," yes"
9165360,9167020," this is how then we return the frame"
9167020,9168800," um"
9168800,9173000," and what's interesting is that"
9173000,9173400," we're"
9173400,9174300," I suppose we"
9174300,9174920," yeah"
9174920,9176460," we'll have to move it"
9176460,9177300," so it will be"
9177300,9178060," movable"
9178060,9179280," all right"
9179280,9182460," so I'm not 100% sure"
9182460,9183420," if it will work"
9183420,9184740," but now"
9184740,9186480," it should be possible"
9186480,9187360," it should be possible to do something like"
9187360,9187820," frame"
9187820,9188600," load"
9188600,9189920," fields"
9189920,9190480," png"
9190480,9191880," uh"
9191880,9194260," right"
9194260,9195960," load this shit like that"
9195960,9197360," without any of this stuff"
9197360,9198360," rotate it"
9198360,9199380," and then save it back"
9199380,9200480," right"
9200480,9203020," so"
9203020,9204200," and of course"
9204200,9204700," uh"
9204700,9205000," error"
9205000,9205420," yeah"
9205420,9206460," we'll have to use"
9206460,9207500," a std"
9207500,9208000," error"
9208000,9209140," error"
9209140,9211340," I feel like I'm"
9211340,9212600," intellectually masturbating"
9212600,9213080," a lot"
9213080,9214320," uh"
9214320,9214920," borrow"
9214920,9215980," the path"
9215980,9216400," instead"
9216400,9217640," you think we need to borrow here"
9217640,9218120," I mean"
9218120,9220080," it makes sense to borrow it"
9220080,9220340," sure"
9220340,9221440," and"
9221440,9222160," um"
9222160,9222500," yeah"
9222500,9223300," I have to return"
9223300,9223740," okay"
9223740,9225940," what else"
9225940,9227360," um"
9227360,9229960," expected track path"
9229960,9230980," I think I have to use"
9230980,9231420," path"
9231420,9232740," new"
9232740,9237540," and uh"
9237540,9240420," I have to unwrap that"
9240420,9241560," maybe no no no"
9241560,9242440," in this particular case"
9242440,9243260," I'm going to use unwrap"
9243260,9245280," okay"
9245280,9245980," cool"
9245980,9247140," so now it worked"
9247140,9248320," uh"
9248320,9248660," and"
9248660,9249600," the next thing"
9249600,9250180," is going to be"
9250180,9251280," implementing safe"
9251280,9252600," safe is going to be similar"
9252600,9253140," right"
9253140,9254020," uh"
9254020,9254440," safe"
9254440,9256260," is going to take"
9256260,9257020," uh"
9257020,9257800," self"
9257800,9258160," uh"
9258160,9260360," I think it's going to take self by a reference"
9260360,9262320," and it's going to take a path"
9262320,9263540," where you want to save all of that"
9263540,9264960," and it's not going to return anything"
9264960,9266060," uh"
9266060,9266460," but"
9266460,9268360," we're going to do it like so"
9268360,9270560," all right"
9270560,9271740," let's put it here"
9271740,9275240," mm-hmm"
9275240,9276940," so we are"
9276940,9278240," taking a reference"
9278240,9278620," above"
9278620,9279360," above writer"
9279360,9281080," then we take an encoder"
9281080,9281540," and"
9281540,9282100," here"
9282100,9282780," instead of frame"
9282780,9283240," I think"
9283240,9284720," I can just simply"
9284720,9285440," uh"
9285440,9287180," do frame"
9287180,9287740," self"
9287740,9288720," boom"
9288720,9290000," and it will work"
9290000,9291460," uh"
9291460,9291920," write"
9291920,9292400," data"
9292400,9292760," image"
9292760,9293160," unwrap"
9293160,9294200," and in this particular case"
9294200,9295200," we can just return"
9295200,9296000," uh"
9296000,9296460," result"
9296460,9297060," nothing"
9297060,9297760," box"
9297760,9298360," dim"
9298360,9299160," array"
9299160,9301040," we probably have to use a very specific"
9301040,9302000," um"
9302000,9303400," specific"
9303400,9304040," uh"
9304040,9304360," error"
9304360,9305500," but I'm too lazy to do that"
9305500,9307180," so I'm going to use just an abstract error"
9307180,9308480," and nothing else"
9308480,9309940," and you know what"
9309940,9311000," we should be able"
9311000,9311440," now"
9311440,9312520," to do the following thing"
9312520,9313260," uh"
9313260,9313620," frame"
9313620,9314100," load"
9314100,9314640," path"
9314640,9316900," new"
9316900,9318480," fields"
9318480,9318960," png"
9318960,9322780," dot"
9322780,9326400," rotate"
9326400,9328360," save"
9328360,9337740," well in this particular case"
9337740,9338660," we can just enrub them"
9338660,9339180," but I mean"
9339180,9339680," immature"
9339680,9342040," but maybe it makes sense"
9342040,9342440," to do that"
9342440,9344720," so the reason why I'm doing it"
9344720,9368320," like that is because i want to be able to just do it like so yeah is that what you like where it goes"
9368320,9371280," is that what you like abstractions"
9373520,9380640," um so you can load the frame save the frame you can rotate the frame and all of that"
9380640,9384880," let's actually try to compile that of course it doesn't really compile really really well"
9384880,9390640," uh i probably have to do something like this yes uh it's not self it's nothing first of all"
9390640,9400240," okay so in this particular case i'll have to return okay uh okay uh-huh uh save no methods"
9400240,9407920," save did i you didn't call it safe why don't i have a method safe found the unit type in the oh"
9407920,9414720," because rotate god damn it so yeah yeah yeah you you have to make it like a mutable uh frame because"
9414720,9422000," yeah well to be fair i think making it like that is going to be a little bit more readable then you frame"
9422000,9429760," rotate and then you frame uh safe and you save that to this particular place and then you do it like"
9429760,9438400," that uh yeah look at the intent of that um expected result found nothing and yeah you you probably have"
9438400,9445360," to do it like so uh do we have anything else to save alternative and compatible types uh yep"
9445360,9451600," no it's it actually has a compatible types if you think about that oh that means i'll i have to remove"
9451600,9458240," that thing okay so path is not used so yeah this is actually pretty cool so let's use path"
9460080,9467680," would you look at that chat and all of that is absolutely safe all of that borrow checks all of"
9467680,9481120," that compiles not a single unsafe isn't that epic yeah is that what you know gives an orgasm to rust"
9481120,9487920," developers i have no idea i don't really program rust i'd uh but apparently this is what you know gives"
9487920,9494400," rust developers developers developers a kick but it's there and safely and depends it's probably i don't"
9494400,9501520," know okay so we have a frame so that means we can now for example uh easily load a bunch of frames"
9501520,9509440," like into a vector of some sort right so we can probably do something like mute vec um and uh do"
9509440,9522880," something like um let me see vec frame new and now we can if we got a list of frames we could load all of"
9522880,9526880," them up into the memory just by using frame load"
9526880,9532640," just by using frame load but how can we know the"
9535120,9544160," that shit one of the things we can have we can for for the time being uh hardcore frame count"
9544160,9552560," like we know for sure that we have 300 frames right uh specifically in the data we have 300 frames"
9552560,9559680," and we just need to load them up the thing is uh they are padded with zeros is there any way in"
9562160,9572720," uh in rust to do a left pad of zeros uh we need the left part chat uh we need the left part"
9572720,9578960," you know that we're gonna have a great time um so okay"
9578960,9591120," rust format leading zeros i'm pretty sure we'll find something uh so there's fmt how the print integer blah"
9591120,9597040," blah blah blah zeros uh oh would you look at that this is how this is literally how we do that"
9597040,9604000," so now we have a way to construct the the file name and shit uh i think it's pretty epic i think it's"
9604000,9613280," pretty epic i'm gonna actually save it here somewhere okay uh so what we can do now is for example um"
9616480,9625280," iterate from zero well i have to iterate from zero to frame count but how do i include frame count as"
9625280,9630080," well how do i include do i do it like that i think i do it like that right so i include it"
9630080,9640400," um jesus it's exactly like you do that in python really the i mean i i'm telling you rust is basically"
9640400,9648800," python come on you thought i was joking right you thought i was joking look self the it's python i'm"
9648800,9660400," telling you it's a python uh all right so now we need to actually work with pots and i want to learn more"
9660400,9669120," about pots can i join paths together uh i can create this kind of thing but then"
9669120,9676800," it joins yeah you can and by the way in python you also join the pots right"
9679200,9688640," creates an owned path buff with path at the joint to self see for more jesus christ so you have path"
9688640,9697040," you have path buff and all of that is because appending a string is in fact a difficult problem"
9697040,9703200," on low level in low level well efficient uh upending stream but i mean come on um"
9703200,9712720," i'm falling asleep chat let's make a small break uh do you guys have any questions"
9712720,9716400," while i'm just actually you know catching my breath"
9716400,9723200," do you have any any questions i'm gonna write a borrow checker on top of python"
9724320,9727360," top hints good luck with that good luck with that"
9727360,9734720," any other questions about rust programming maybe haskell"
9734720,9738160," just feel free to ask anything"
9738160,9746720," why are us developers like to see worldburn with their naming i don't know i have no idea what you're"
9746720,9753600," talking about um how are you today my fellow old chap oh you're not even talking to me"
9754880,9761760," uh nobody's asking what is my day how how am i doing everybody just everybody just wants me to program"
9761760,9762160," in rust"
9762160,9766960," anyway"
9766960,9772880," any other questions how was your day oh thank you thank you for asking"
9773440,9776480," i watched about uh one hundred selling clips yesterday"
9776480,9778240," nice"
9778240,9784720," my day was fine how was your day i suppose you already answered that by saying you watched"
9784720,9791680," the clips it's our day yes why are us developers recreating the world i have no idea what you're"
9791680,9800080," talking about uh thank you for asking arch thank you thank you so thank you i've been here for asking i'm"
9800080,9807200," i'm doing great i'm doing great really appreciate that white cargo 151 errors with uh spurs network"
9807200,9813520," error while cargo does not uh you have problem with your internet so it's your internet provider checking"
9813520,9820560," the version of your cargo and if your version is 1.445 it just blocks your connection that's what it's doing"
9820560,9824640," um so"
9824640,9832000," hello lord alpaca hello hello does anybody have any questions about what we're doing or maybe"
9832000,9836080," suggestions complaints or something does anybody does anybody know what we're doing"
9836080,9838720," what we're doing"
9838720,9847120," how's the weather over there it's raining it's raining man hallelujah"
9847120,9861440," um so it's one play rust length okay let's let's take a look"
9865040,9865440," epic"
9865440,9873360," thank you so much i'm gonna use that thank you"
9873360,9880320," it's actually pretty cool i think i i created a beautiful community i created absolutely beautiful"
9880320,9887520," community i'm working when i feel tired i make a small break but community still continues working on"
9887520,9890000," the code this is so beautiful"
9894720,9904480," um so yeah thank you so much thank you um we're still working on time displacement i mean"
9904480,9907120," yeah rust is not helping"
9907120,9917840," but does this code licensed probably it's licensed under gpl and i will be forced to put the gpl on my own on the"
9917840,9930480," the whole source source code um so okay let's let's let's do that boozing goes let's do that okay boom we're"
9930480,9936240," gonna use this but the frames are located actually in a different place so we'll have to do something"
9936240,9945520," like uh frames folder and we'll have to put it somewhere into data frame yeah it's it's located in data frames"
9945520,9951760," uh in data frames and the easiest way for me would be just do something like that"
9953520,9966960," um yeah frame folder and i and we're gonna have a png here i wonder why path doesn't have something like"
9966960,9971760," that but maybe you're not supposed to use it like that in path uh maybe you're supposed to use it"
9971760,9972560," somehow differently"
9972560,9979360," what the is this quote for mr vodka"
9979360,9984960," uh this is beautiful good all this"
9990000,9996000," all right so and now we can load the frame right"
9996000,10002240," this is the weirdest code i've ever written like i don't quite understand why i have to read it like"
10002240,10010720," that but whatever and here we can have frames a bunch of frames and i suppose i can push those frames"
10010720,10019840," to the push the loaded frames there and that loads up the frames does it not yes that loads up the frames"
10020000,10039200," we're gonna we're gonna start with a very simple uh time displacement um i think i want to rename uh this thing"
10039200,10049440," into frame folder an input folder uh input folder because on top of that we're gonna we're going to have"
10049440,10054240," the output folder uh i don't know where it's going to be located but let's put it into the output maybe"
10054240,10061200," into the data output uh something like that right so this is where it's going to be located right"
10061200,10068480," this is where we're going to look at it and uh let's see if this shit compiles or not let's see if it"
10068480,10072480," compiles and maybe let's see if it works i don't know"
10077280,10080720," it doesn't try avoiding uh"
10080720,10090320," found uh-huh this is because i'll have to unwrap the load i see uh didn't really work correctly um"
10090320,10098400," yeah i'll have to do this thing as well and it seems to be twerking it seems to be working did i run this"
10098400,10104400," no i just built it so the thing i want to do boys and girls the thing i want to do uh so basically now i'm"
10104400,10112320," scaling my simple rotation example scaling simple rotation example to several files simultaneously"
10112320,10117680," that's what we're doing we're scanning that so what i'm thinking about is that"
10117680,10127760," we'll probably have to well for for that example using frames factor is unnecessary i do realize that"
10128800,10130880," but it's going to be needed in the future"
10130880,10150560," thank you so much for 11 months of tier one subscription puker thank you thank you so much and"
10150560,10159840," welcome back to our epic russ development club my god absolutely epic thank you so much now you know"
10159840,10163680," how to count in russian if you ever wanted to know that so this is how we're counting it"
10166080,10180960," um so what i want to do i want to just iterate the frames um you didn't see that um in zero in zero"
10180960,10194080," frame count and we do a frames i rotate right frames i rotate and then uh we're going to do a similar thing"
10194080,10202080," here uh we're going to iterate it twice god damn it i have a reflex i mean i just have a macro that expands like"
10202080,10206480," that um frames i"
10206480,10212800," save path new format"
10215360,10226560," slash zero four png output folder by the way i plus one okay then after we saved all of that we'll have"
10226560,10233360," to unwrap that uh there we go there we go i think this is how we're going to do that but the problem here"
10233360,10243200," chat is what if we don't have this is there any make deer in rust that we can utilize is there anything like"
10243200,10249120," that let's find out it's usually called major no it is not a make"
10249120,10255200," directory okay directory"
10255200,10262480," ah rust make directory"
10267360,10273200," um oh create deer this is how it's going would you look at that would you look at that uh how can i"
10273200,10278880," like create do you all create your all there you go regardless of the creator directory and all of its"
10278880,10286960," parents uh components if they are missing this is the i was subscribed for yeah before trying to do all of"
10286960,10294880," that stuff right before trying to do all of that stuff uh we're going to try to create output folder"
10294880,10310800," uh yes do we have to actually print the progress of some sort what do you guys think"
10310800,10326640," uh so path uh let's actually do output uh path right and we save that"
10326640,10340000," somewhere here and let's do output uh output path there we go there we go there we go"
10340000,10348560," compiles chat shut shut are you ready are you mother flipping ready i'm gonna run this"
10348560,10362880," be doing things very slowly"
10362880,10369120," i don't even know at what stage it is"
10371760,10379600," not i don't really know what the is it doing but it could be that it's dying okay"
10379600,10383680," so all right"
10383680,10397200," yeah i need to log that by the way print ln this is kind of weird emacs what are you doing emacs could you"
10397200,10402240," please note i forgot to put this thing here okay uh print ln"
10402240,10414880," saving output this is not what i want output path so how slow it is uh input path"
10414880,10422640," so this is what we're gonna have uh we might as well actually save this entire thing as out yeah whatever"
10422640,10430880," let's actually do it like that uh input path boom input path and what we can look here essentially"
10430880,10438400," uh so i'm the thing i'm trying to do i want to load everything into the memory so this this is kind of"
10438400,10444640," the point loading this thing input path uh all right so"
10448000,10455200," we can also look this thing here just in case rotating rotating frame i"
10455200,10461360," yeah so basically each individual step is going to be locked and we'll see what is going on there"
10461360,10466320," and how slowly it does all of these things uh there we go"
10468640,10478800," this is how quickly it loads up the pngs but it's in debug mode it is in fact in debug mode so"
10478800,10490400," all right this is unbelievably slow in in debug please show me there it is now we're talking"
10492160,10494640," uh-huh rotating and saving back"
10494640,10506000," there we go so it's done so yeah this is how you have to do like i suppose to to actually do anything"
10506000,10511520," useful in rust you have to always uh compile that in release mode and there you go we have output frames"
10511520,10516880," so here they are and they are actually rotated and one of the things i want to do actually chat i want"
10516880,10524960," to create the shell script like a similar to extract frames um something like compose um compose output"
10524960,10537040," don't put sh so extract frames uh it's going to be something like this pin sh and set xe and we're"
10537040,10541520," going to do ffmpeg ffmpega and input is going to be slightly different it's going to be output"
10542160,10555360," uh four d png and the so this is the input and we're going to do output mp4 i suppose this is the"
10555360,10565360," thing i want to do i think uh there we go so let's do this kind of shit uh come"
10570720,10581600," compose output okay so it's composing the frames and there we go and uh if i play that shit in m"
10581600,10587200," player as you can see it's rotated 100 degrees and we rotated that in rust"
10587200,10599280," so as you can see we have test bench to generate frames and then compose them back into the video so we"
10599280,10609840," have this uh sort of like uh setup uh that we can work with okay so how big of the file that shit is"
10609840,10620000," um i think we can fit all of that into the repo i do think so except the frames themselves so i suppose"
10620000,10626960," you'll have to extract frames and output yourself like extract frames blah blah blah so i'm gonna git ignore"
10626960,10632640," uh some of the things here i'm gonna git ignore some of the things specifically we're ignoring frames"
10632640,10638640," no no no yeah we're ignoring frames and output so maybe this thing has to be called input but i'm"
10638640,10644880," don't want to rename it anymore uh and before um and i guess that's it that's the only thing i want to"
10644880,10650880," ignore here because all of that can be generated quite easily and i think the time has come to try to"
10650880,10661440," commit all that okay uh so this is what we're ignoring there uh also target edit edit by cargo jesus christ"
10661440,10668800," all these fucking tools they just add that for me like like i'm a little baby or something uh feels png do"
10668800,10677680," we need to do we need all of that i don't think we need these pngs anymore so at git ignora here uh edit by alexi"
10677680,10682560," i mean i mean if okay"
10685920,10703280," uh png uh png so this is the things we add here um"
10703280,10711840," pasta like i mean i think i have to update because it's not really clear from where you can download that"
10711840,10721600," uh where is the pasta so here's the pasta uh pasta food so this is from where we talk we took all that"
10721600,10726320," so there's the initial commit"
10726320,10740560," so i think i i want to change some of this stuff like for example i don't like the fact that this thing is"
10740560,10747200," called frames i think it should be called input right so there's input and there is output and on top"
10747200,10754880," of that uh something like pasta has to be called input as well you see so now we have some sort of"
10754880,10762320," consistency so we have input mp4 and the the input folder that contains the frame and we have output folder with"
10762320,10764640," frames and output mp4 um"
10766800,10773760," um okay so in in compose uh extract frames uh this thing has to be called input and this thing has to"
10773760,10781840," be called input see see now we have consistency um and this thing should not be called the extract frames"
10781840,10784560," it should be uh extract"
10787280,10788480," extract input"
10788480,10799280," and furthermore i think this particular script should be renamed like so right you have input extract"
10799280,10806800," that takes input mp4 and extracts it into input and output compose the text you see like consistency"
10806800,10814320," consistency is slowly improving and since this particular script uh talks about input maybe we can"
10814320,10819440," also cut a hard code input uh into input input mp4 i think"
10819440,10827280," um but i don't want to rename it anymore yes i didn't want to now i want to"
10828080,10835600," so i constantly changing my mind so it doesn't really matter so yeah uh okay so we don't have that"
10835600,10846560," we don't have things whatever whatever so and now we have uh frames this is input this is output and"
10846560,10854080," everything is okie dokie karaoke so but on top of that i think it ignore yeah it should be input"
10855840,10866240," output and output mp4 is like that so what i'm thinking about should it really be inside of the data"
10866240,10875040," should it really be inside of the data uh i think it's it's kind of cool that we have a separate folder"
10875040,10880720," for all this i think it's kind of cool so but furthermore"
10880720,10892400," okay let's let's first document whatever we have already let's open readme uh time displacement in rust"
10898000,10916480," to understand watch this uh okay where is my uh project uh but i'm bottom i'm gonna take this thing"
10919120,10929360," to understand to understand what is the time displacement all right uh time displacement in"
10929360,10936400," rust uh we're gonna have quick start instructions quick start so what you're gonna do you're supposed to"
10938240,10952560," first cd to data right and um input extract uh input yeah input extract"
10952560,10964000," uh input extract input extract input extract there we go then after that"
10966800,10975760," you have to do cargo run release go back into data output compose"
10975760,10985440," could you please yeah thank you jesus christ uh emacs is unbearable uh and now mplayer"
10985440,10993760," um output mp4 so this is the problem with the current uh with the current in"
10994800,10998000," workflow this is the problem it's very inconvenient"
10998000,11007840," it's very inconvenient right so how can we improve this workflow how can we improve this workflow does"
11007840,11012640," anybody know does anybody have any ideas on how to improve this workflow one of the way to improve"
11012640,11019600," it is actually to move everything uh from inside of the data to the current folder but it i i'm afraid"
11019600,11024800," that it will create a lot of mess that's what i'm afraid with but maybe the data folder is not that"
11024800,11032560," messy to be fair you see like it's kind of i think it makes sense to actually move it um"
11032560,11038080," move it outside of the data it will create like a lot of convenient uh"
11038080,11044480," situations so so first of all you you don't have to do that you won't have to do that so basically look"
11044480,11050560," look how easy a workflow will become input extract run release output compose and you can open the"
11050560,11057120," written planner so i think it's worth it and i think it's not going to pollute the folder that much"
11057920,11064640," uh yeah so let's actually go data and take all of this and move there"
11064640,11084960," something like that uh source we can take this uh here uh credits the video was taken from here so and that"
11084960,11093040," means we can get rid of the data of the source and then the things we'll have to get ignore on the higher"
11093040,11099200," level are going to be this there we go oh maybe since we don't have that anymore it just doesn't really"
11099200,11106720," need anymore and now i can get rid of the data uh-huh uh-huh look at that chat isn't that better workflow"
11106720,11110960," isn't that better workflow uh-huh yes"
11110960,11119440," yeah i think so uh let's take a look at how it's going to work let's take a look at how it's going"
11119440,11124960," to work so we're going to follow the uh the instructions and see if they actually work or not"
11124960,11131280," so this is how we do that we execute this input shell command it extracts the frames right it simply"
11131280,11136640," extracts the frames next we have to transform the frames but the problem with that is that when"
11136640,11142560," you transform the frames we still refer to the uh to the data to the data subfolders so we'll have to"
11142560,11150960," uh get rid of it let's quickly get rid of it all right um so let's quickly get rid of it and the"
11150960,11156640," the second step is to actually run the cargo release uh i should have actually run it like"
11156640,11161040," that yeah there we go in the cargo release it's compiling everything it's loading all the frames in"
11161040,11166800," the memory right uh and transforming the frames has already transformed them and loading them back"
11166800,11176560," okay after that uh we want to compose the output out of the frames yeah you see this is the problem it"
11176560,11182960," asks about overriding this thing that means we'll have to go to the output compose uh compose script"
11182960,11190400," and actually add yes there and maybe it makes sense to add yes to this one as well all right after that"
11190400,11197600," once everything is composed we open it in mplayer and there you go so i think that improves improved"
11197600,11204320," the workflow dramatically now it's sort of manageable you can see all that you input extract frames you"
11204320,11210560," transform all that shit output compose and then you just play the output is that a good workflow i think"
11210560,11215840," it's a way better workflow than it was before in my opinion just just saying"
11215840,11225040," and without this kind of workflow it's kind of difficult to to modify and and stuff all right"
11225040,11230160," uh and also we need to add the license license is mit already okay that's that's nice i don't have"
11230160,11244960," to think about it too much all right um implement test bench for time displacement implementation"
11244960,11251040," and let's push that right into the report so let's take a look at how it looks like in the report"
11256880,11265280," um i'm am i still pushing get fucking damn it i actually used um url https url instead of ssh url"
11265280,11270800," god damn it uh-huh um configure"
11270800,11279040," git what the hell is going on um configure origin"
11281840,11293520," url url uh-huh cool cool push right into the report there we go come on push it push it push it push it push"
11293520,11304000," it push it push it push it push it uh so it's done look at that look at that so now you can even try it at home"
11306480,11313200," so yeah so just follow these instructions if you have uh ffm pack uh and rust you probably have a"
11313200,11319600," ffm pack or rust if you're watching the stream um you just follow this you know workflow and it will"
11319600,11326400," produce output mp4 and yeah let me go so we have some sort of like a test bench we wasted three hours"
11326400,11332560," on setting up that test bench yes that's why i'm unemployed right this is why i'm unemployed"
11333360,11338240," because uh how inefficient i am it took me three hours to set this thing up unbelievable i'm be"
11338240,11340240," fucking little so"
11340240,11346960," i'm all right so inefficient"
11346960,11356320," all right so how are we gonna do this thing i think i'm gonna do a very simple idea"
11358480,11368560," uh basically each next row is gonna be next frame that's the idea that's the idea that i'm gonna have"
11368560,11376400," but i'm not kind of sure if it's a good idea because we have only 300 frames right it's only 300 frames"
11376400,11382480," but what's the height of the output what's the height of the output"
11385120,11392880," the height of the output is around 300 so if each individual row is going to be the next frame"
11392880,11403040," that means uh we're gonna have like 60 frames until we start running out of frames"
11403040,11411200," right this is making sense because since we are tilting the um the surface that scans"
11412000,11417920," the uh the frames at some point we're not gonna have enough rows to actually display anything there"
11417920,11421040," right we're not gonna have anything like enough rows at all"
11421040,11429600," uh so yeah we'll have to scan until we have something to display and then um"
11429600,11430480," yeah"
11432320,11437600," we'll see we'll see we'll see anyway uh let's uh let's make a small break because i need my brain to"
11437600,11443360," uh recover a little bit and maybe you have any questions maybe you have any questions maybe you"
11443360,11445760," want to ask anything about what we're doing"
11445760,11455360," uh is this stream online the stream seems to be online it's just chat is dead apparently"
11456000,11457600," chat is seems to be dying"
11457600,11466240," um uh can i go to the bathroom yeah i feel free to do to go there and can somebody explain me the"
11466240,11471040," woo thing you know nobody can explain you you don't explain memes it's like explaining jokes you ruin them"
11471040,11478720," what's sorting uh check out exclamation mark fiq commands there is it's a pretty common uh like"
11478720,11484000," commonly asked question are there recruiters lurking on twitch uh probably not because throughout my"
11484560,11491760," five years of streaming not a single recruiter actually contacted me uh referring to twitch"
11491760,11498640," not a single one it's almost like recruiters don't even know that developers actually stream in twitch"
11498640,11505680," they don't know they just don't uh or maybe i'm just look like an that nobody"
11505680,11512000," wants to hire that could be a possibility too yeah that could be a possibility so take my words with a grain of salt"
11513600,11519440," uh could you could you explain in arms and rust please i cannot because i have no idea i don't"
11519440,11524160," program in rust um i'm not even joking i have no idea like if i need to use in arms and rust i"
11524160,11528720," would just google up copy paste the first result from the tech overflow and just forget about it this"
11528720,11532640," is how i would do that and as a matter of fact in 2020 i don't quite understand why you need to"
11532640,11536560," understand languages you just copy paste from the internet anyway like you don't need to understand"
11536560,11544400," anything come on why do you need any explanations uh all right uh the balance isn't twitch blocked in"
11544400,11549760," russia twitch is not blocked in russia it's almost like toting sucks and no one wants to recruit him yeah"
11549760,11555280," maybe maybe that's the reason because i i suck i mean if i was a good programmer would i stream on twitch"
11555280,11562720," just think about that i would probably work at google or something like obviously i'm a bad programmer"
11563680,11569840," uh so and that's why like recruiters see me on twitch they look how bad my skills are and they"
11569840,11576560," don't even want to contact me like i'm out of the questions like first day um okay oh by the way i"
11576560,11584560," i forgot that i need to keep the source code opened for new people who uh who will join because people"
11584560,11596000," don't won't believe that i'm programming last so all right does anybody have any other questions does"
11596000,11597200," anybody have any other questions"
11602000,11608560," what is trendy in 2020 amazon so is amazon new google right so i'm really sorry i'm a boomer so"
11608560,11613680," for me google is still epic company that everybody wants to work in so maybe in 2020 it's not true"
11613680,11621440," anymore so maybe these days it's amazon or i have no idea so nobody wants to hire me anyway so why do"
11621440,11629040," we need to even know that uh so i can tell if you're angry being sarcastic or just zoning out no i'm just"
11629040,11635440," being russian don't think about it um are you going to introduce a multi-threading i don't think so"
11635440,11640640," um well yeah sounds like a good idea because"
11640640,11647520," like next frame doesn't depend on the previous one right so that means you can generate those frames"
11647520,11654960," independently right you can just generate those frames independently and uh yeah maybe it makes sense to"
11654960,11659920," introduce uh multi-threading i'll think about that i'll think about that thank you so much um"
11659920,11663360," hmm that's a good idea"
11663360,11670320," um i think i wait uh i've never tried to think away in rust by the way is it the same as in javascript"
11670320,11674640," it should be like similar to the javascript what's funny is that"
11677680,11682880," really is i want to actually google that up i think is it really like in javascript"
11682880,11691440," because if for these rust developers just introduced two different notations for the same thing"
11691440,11694800," and haskell developers will understand what i'm talking about"
11694800,11701840," it's not quite what is it do we have any haskell developers do you know what i'm talking about"
11702480,11708960," so yes if if it is like that they introduce like two different notations for the same"
11708960,11717760," uh silly silly razz developers okay so rust async await"
11717760,11731440," all right i said what the is this and i don't know too much text i don't want to read"
11732720,11735360," uh think about primer but why does it okay"
11735360,11742640," uh i think is a it doesn't want to scale for some reason i think a weight is a built-in tool for"
11742640,11746400," writing a synchronous function that look like synchronous a code a sync transforms block of"
11746400,11749280," code into state machine that implements the trade called future"
11749280,11762560," yes i see basically if your monet is rust you're using question mark denotation if your monet is future"
11762720,11764640," which is not monet by the way but nobody gives a"
11764640,11772320," your user sync away donation yes so rust has two different donations for two different kinds of monads"
11772320,11779440," laughing in haskell anyway"
11779440,11784080," um so"
11792720,11796800," so does anybody have any other questions"
11796800,11806160," do you mean question mark async await and generates this all being just a monads yeah that's what i mean"
11806160,11809280," basically i don't get the joke because there is no joke"
11814480,11823120," uh did you just hear monads well yeah but as you know monads are not even a thing right functional"
11823120,11828000," developers just you know reinvented the same thing that was available on in the languages in the first"
11828000,11829760," place am i right so"
11829760,11839280," yeah the function of the program is just reinvented what was already there so it's not a thing so i don't"
11839280,11841040," really know why you care about monads"
11841040,11851120," because everybody knows that monads are only about sequential computations and nothing else well they"
11851120,11853680," technically are but yeah who cares"
11863760,11880400," anyways um so i think i refreshed a little bit so maybe we can continue god damn i want to pee"
11880400,11888160," uh welcome to the meme arch lss uh monas being um monoids in the category of end of functors is actually a meme"
11888640,11892880," and yeah welcome welcome to the meme"
11892880,11898480," everybody knows this meme like it's obviously monads are"
11898480,11903760," monoids in a category of ender functors everybody fucking knows that"
11903760,11910480," like everybody like it's so simple they're monoids in the category of end of functors"
11915440,11921040," all right yeah but seriously it's it's a joke it's basically like a husky inside joke"
11921040,11926400," basically making fun of how ridiculous and over complicated these things are"
11926400,11929360," which in fact they're actually super simple"
11929360,11934560," just you know this is what you get when you let mathematicians to program"
11934560,11941360," um all right and it's not i'm not saying that mathematicians shouldn't program everybody should do"
11941360,11946160," whatever the they want i'm just saying um this is what you get when they do"
11946160,11953840," functional programming okay"
11953840,11958560," oh boy"
11958560,11966240," okay what i need to do chat i need to have a function that generates me the next frame"
11966240,11971200," that's what i need to do but what's funny is that i need a function that generates me the next frame"
11972160,11976240," based on this stuff okay"
11976240,11983440," duh is it possible to get the size of the slice in in rust is that even a thing"
11983440,11989680," displaced displaced frame"
11989680,11999680," uh displace frame so this thing is going to take not just frame but it's going to get a bunch of frames"
12000320,12006800," right it's going to get the bunch of frames so you see we're getting the bunch of frames and we're getting an index"
12006800,12016800," and on top of that i think uh we should not construct a new frame all the time"
12016800,12025920," what we should do instead we should probably accept the um the output frame yeah we should accept the output frame"
12025920,12030640," because you know allocating that all the like all the time is not going to be a really healthy"
12030640,12034560," um output frame so let's actually do something like that it's going to be a mutable frame"
12034560,12039920," and uh do we want to return anything i think this thing is not going to return anything here's the"
12039920,12045600," function that we need to implement we get this is by the way the cube remember how the beginning of"
12045600,12051680," the of the stream i explained uh like for time displacement in terms of a cube so you take the"
12051680,12058080," frames you stack them on each other and you get a cube or you know whatever and then you"
12058080,12064080," different get different slices so here is the cube of frames it's literally array of frames so this is the cube"
12064080,12074000," so index we want to take index this place frame and we're going to output that frame to that frame right"
12074000,12080480," so and what we're going to do in this particular situation i don't know if it makes any sense to do it"
12080480,12082880," like that but we'll give it a try"
12082880,12092720," yeah so we just need to implement that let's go ahead and do that so in this particular situation we should not"
12093360,12098160," really save anything but we'll have to yeah"
12098160,12100880," just like so"
12100880,12106160," unimplemented"
12106160,12116400," i want to make a very small break chat i want to make a very small break because i need to pee real quick"
12116400,12119920," the quickest peer on the west"
12121120,12124000," all right so i think i'm gonna go ahead and just make a small break"
12124000,12130400," uh i hope you don't mind small break one minute"
12130400,12139840," uh so what we should listen to what should we listen to"
12141680,12144960," does anybody want to listen to a rainy jazz"
12144960,12146160," how about that"
12146160,12151600," a little bit of rainy jazz"
12157680,12169200," all right let's make a small break boys and girls and you guys have fun"
12169200,12171200," so"
12171200,12184640," do you"

12371440,12376320," awkward pause hello everyone welcome back"
12384080,12384800," let's continue"
12384800,12388960," uh good morning it's time already god damn"
12388960,12390160," i slept for too long"
12390160,12392160," slept for too long"
12392160,12397520," all right all right all right all right all right"
12397520,12400160," um okay so what we're gonna do here"
12400160,12404960," we need to iterate to some particular degree i don't know"
12406720,12412800," um so i load up all of the frames right i load up with the praise and the problem with this kind"
12412800,12421840," of shit is that i need to know what frame to construct so i think i will just look at the"
12421840,12426720," first frame that we loaded up and i'm going to assume that this is going to be the format for"
12426720,12430320," the rest of the frames so i'm not going to check that the rest of the frames are like that i'm"
12430320,12435840," going to just simply assume that uh the rest of the frames are like that so and i need a"
12435840,12441440," function very similar to the yeah there we go i already have this one so i'm going to use this"
12441440,12447440," function to create a new frame based on on its info so look look how i'm going to do that"
12447440,12454080," first of all i'm doing a very interesting assertion uh stating that i expect the size the"
12454080,12460880," the amount of frames here being well i know the amount of frames already which is kind of lame"
12462320,12468560," i think we should actually guess the amount of frame the frames ourselves uh but we'll see how it"
12468560,12478000," goes and so i'm making a very important assumption here uh that a frame count is uh greater than zero"
12478000,12485360," because i'm gonna use i'm gonna look at the first one is there chat is there any way for me to do that"
12485360,12494000," at compile time is there any compile time assertion in rust is that even a thing in rust do we have any"
12494000,12506160," rust professional rust developers here in the chat um anyways uh so what we're going to do i'm going to"
12506160,12515600," construct the output frame uh mutable output frame uh frame new and i'm going to just take frames zero"
12515600,12520480," and extract it's in four and i'm going to just move it there uh what's interesting is that"
12520480,12527280," does new yeah yeah it unfortunately it moves it"
12528720,12534720," and i'm not even sure if i can easily copy it so this may not compile because of the um"
12534720,12544240," because of the borrow checker example um okay so now i have the output frame and the thing i want to do"
12544240,12549920," i want to now iterate through these frames and displace them how i'm going to displace them"
12551440,12558160," uh i'm going to you know let me actually go to displace and copy paste the entire signature because"
12558160,12565680," it makes it it will make it easier for me to uh you know work with it all right so here's the frame so"
12565680,12573360," i'll have to pass the frames here they are and index um let's use the index like that maybe maybe i should"
12573360,12584080," call it index i already call it i whatever uh and output frame uh here's this so we just displaced a single"
12584080,12594160," frame uh after that after we displaced a single frame it makes sense to save that frame to save that frame"
12595040,12609200," to uh to uh to the output path right away um yeah like so"
12609200,12622240," maybe it would make sense to put it here there we go um displacing splacing frame this"
12622960,12628720," to this i okay so this is what we're doing we're displacing frame i"
12628720,12635440," to particular path uh and the output path has to be actually constructed before that"
12635440,12641040," so we're displacing that to here and then we're saving output frame to that particular path"
12641040,12646400," so this is basically what we're doing chat so we have a single output frame to which we're displacing"
12649040,12654800," and yeah that's pretty much it that's pretty much it uh and let's see how it's gonna go"
12654800,12657680," and if it's gonna even go correctly"
12657680,12667040," let's try to compile it first of all uh see if it even compiles this is not how we're gonna compile that"
12669200,12679120," uh cargo build cargo build it does not compile because why uh because why so these are the warnings and"
12679120,12684400," what we have here and there you go cannot yeah this mother flipper moves it inside"
12684400,12691120," get them so one of the things we probably want to do chat uh we want to accept"
12692320,12702480," the output info by reference right which may solve that problem right so now we are uh accepting it by"
12702480,12709280," reference and everywhere we're accepting it by reference we have to yeah so in here we probably want to"
12709280,12717760," clone that entire thing and i wonder if output in four is very expensive to clone i don't think so to be fair"
12718480,12728240," um so docs rs i think it should be really cheap to to clone because it's just like a structure like a"
12728240,12739280," very simple structure uh and i don't quite understand why there is no copy yeah this is the whole thing"
12739840,12748320," it's like five numbers like this entire structure is literally five numbers and there is no a copy uh"
12748320,12756880," copy interface implemented for it i don't know why but it's not like expensive you just just can copy it"
12756880,12763200," but you have to be very explicit about it and i'm not even sure if you can clone it easily uh expected"
12763200,12770320," struct output but got uh well yeah you cannot even do that so how do i copy it does anybody know how"
12770320,12778000," do i copy structures uh uh rust copy struct"
12778000,12787680," copy struct how do you copy the structures check so there's a you have to do clone stuff right you have"
12787680,12802560," to do clone stuff do we have any professional rust developers in the chat does anybody know how do i copy um"
12802560,12813440," so uh to indicate that you want to use a copy of some struct for some reason value for"
12813440,12824480," uh for uh for example this gives point a new y so do i literally have to do output info"
12824480,12828400," no"
12828400,12833600," it doesn't have that field"
12833600,12842960," how do i copy structure clone okay are you professional software uh rust developer"
12843440,12850640," expected struct found"
12850640,12861920," so doesn't work how they do that so they have to pass it by reference but in that case it's going to move"
12861920,12866560," so and i don't want to move it i want to take a copy"
12870480,12874560," it copies by default if it has clone and copy it doesn't have a common copy"
12874560,12882800," as far as i know uh copy clone it doesn't have it doesn't implement it"
12882800,12886400," uh i i don't know the structure it's not my structure"
12886400,12890480," it's not my structure i cannot do that"
12897280,12899680," i think they'll say okay so um"
12899680,12913040," yes finally people are suggesting it's like okay it feels like you know tech support right"
12913040,12918480," you call the tech support and they ask you have you tried to turn it off and on again"
12918480,12924720," uh it doesn't work okay we're gonna like uh redirect you to our technician the next technician ask uh have you"
12924720,12930160," tried to turn it off and on again uh you say yes i tried oh i'm gonna redirect you to a higher"
12930160,12935520," technician this is like the same thing i already tried all this thing and i asked the chat and just"
12935520,12941440," chat suggested the same things like we tried them again yes for finally finally we realized that"
12941440,12947920," i'm not asking for nothing yes yes finally uh all right expected track found do i really have to"
12947920,12952560," dereference that thing do i really have to dereference maybe i do have to dereference it okay"
12952560,12955200," um"
12955200,12958240," uh"
12958240,12964880," all right and here so do we have all of that are warnings i wonder if i can do that a little bit"
12964880,12971280," better i wonder is it really like that but if i for example dereference it can it copy that for me"
12972880,12982240," so this is a move right so it performs the move but can i clone that thing afterwards"
12982240,12986480," so is this the only way i can do it"
12986480,12991040," output info"
12995840,12998080," this is literally the only way i can do that"
12998080,13010000," if it has this thing pub it it will also work pub i don't really understand what do you mean i don't"
13010000,13018560," understand what you mean so it has like some some technical i don't know whatever so um next"
13018800,13030000," i just need to copy structure do you know how you copy structure and see you just pass it by an"
13030000,13030880," argument there you go"
13030880,13037520," uh jesus christ"
13037520,13043920," future of programming by the way future of programming right here on your screen"
13045120,13048880," so uh displacement so we need to display the frame"
13048880,13062640," so what i need to iterate so for a specific index uh i need to iterate uh rows right i need to iterate"
13062640,13068080," rows let's actually start with iterating rows uh i'll probably need width and height here i'll probably"
13068080,13079520," need width and height uh-huh yeah and width width and height should be taken from a single frame it should"
13079520,13086480," be probably taken from a single frame but which one okay we can take it from the frame index or whatever"
13086480,13095920," uh it's not a self though it's frames index we're taking in four width and height and there you go we're"
13095920,13102400," going to use width and height of that particular uh frame so after that we have to iterate the rows from"
13102400,13109360," zero to h from zero to h but we're going to iterate all of the rows we're going to iterate all of the rows"
13109360,13116880," and so now"
13119600,13122640," but the columns that we're going to take are going to be slightly different"
13122640,13125280," the columns that we're going to take"
13125280,13133840," so now i want"
13133840,13140000," some sort of stuff i want an easy way to copy a row"
13140000,13146160," is there such thing as mem copy in rust that can actually do that super fast for me"
13147760,13155520," uh where is my so these are structs let me go here"
13155520,13161840," mem copy so it's part of c"
13161840,13167600," um is there something like this it's incapable of doing that"
13169920,13177280," so we can to pointer like there is a um module mem right does what does it have any copy things in it"
13177280,13181120," transmute copy so transmit copy"
13181120,13188400," useless i see so we'll have to actually copy it one by one a few future of programming by the way"
13188400,13195440," feature of the high performance program um dead who's dead you are dead"
13196240,13209440," um the current row and maybe we'll have to also um keep the current index keep updating the current index"
13210320,13214720," so output frame"
13214720,13220160," um copy role"
13220160,13231200," frames frames index and want what role do i want to copy"
13231200,13236720," what role do i want to copy i want to copy a role at index here"
13236720,13241280," so in this particular thing of course i want to pass by uh immutable reference"
13241280,13244720," so now uh we want to implement this kind of thing"
13244720,13246640," uh"
13246640,13250880," no the the role we're trying to copy we're trying to copy this role"
13250880,13253840," okay so let's actually go ahead and implement this this kind of thing"
13253840,13257760," um copy role fn"
13258320,13262880," so it accepts self self self a mutable self"
13262880,13270880," std ptr copy but it's unsafe isn't it so is it i thought it's unsafe because it's ptr"
13270880,13277360," right i thought it's very unsafe um i saw it"
13278720,13283360," where am i it's png it's a wrong one uh let me go there"
13283360,13286320," copy"
13286320,13291760," so ptr copying yeah it's unsafe doesn't matter"
13291760,13299440," uh okay so and we accept the frame uh by a constant reference so this thing should not return"
13299440,13305760," anything and i think it's okay and also we should accept the frame the role that we're trying to copy here"
13308400,13314160," use size so we do a couple of assertions here like we do a lot of assertions here"
13314160,13319120," um"
13319120,13322640," the first assertion i would say is that"
13322640,13328320," frame info and i'm not even sure if output in four is even comparable"
13328320,13333600," are they comparable does it implement uh equal interface of some sort"
13334160,13336960," no it doesn't like it doesn't implement anything useful"
13336960,13343360," like output in four is kind of useless in this particular sense so i have to literally extract all"
13343360,13348320," okay but maybe it's it's for the best so we're going to assume that their um"
13348320,13354400," their stuff is is pretty much the same so i need to iterate uh their stuff"
13356080,13359520," so this is going to be self self width"
13359520,13365760," self width"
13365760,13383040," for column in zero to width what we're doing we are taking an index like pixels um maybe self pixel index"
13383840,13392000," uh providing a row and column that gives one pixel then we take pixels and then we assign"
13392000,13402000," self pixels and on the self pixels but frame pixels at frames pixel index"
13402000,13406720," row column this is what we do so this is how we're going to copy this"
13410160,13413040," so the thing that i'm not super happy about is that"
13413040,13428960," each frame each frame um storing its info is wasteful it's definitely wasteful we only need to keep"
13428960,13437600," one single instance on often for for the whole thing because they're the same format so maybe the entity here"
13437600,13444960," is not the frame but actually a bunch of frame a bunch of frames something like um well yeah so so"
13444960,13451040," the frames is probably going to be that so it's just a bunch of pixels but um we should implement"
13451040,13458400," a movie entity that keeps a single output and for for all of the frames inside of the movie so we"
13458400,13463680," probably have to do something like that right because you know story like copy of output and for is"
13463680,13470400," extremely wasteful but that may require reorganization of the code and for example movie will have this"
13470400,13475120," method of displacing a single frame because this is basically the movie so we'll have to reorganize it a"
13475120,13481360," little bit but that's for the next time uh so but i'm going to put a to do here just in case i'm going to"
13481360,13493040," just put it to do here all right check all right um so this is how we copy a single row we'll copy a single"
13493040,13507360," row don't see anything anything special um yeah and when we displace that thing yeah this is this is how we just copy that"
13507360,13519840," and at some point we'll have to advance that index a little bit we'll have to advance that index a little"
13519840,13526400," bit but how we're going to advance that index that's a really good question let me let me see how we can do"
13526400,13544480," that um so we can sort of keep track of yeah um index plus"
13544720,13557280," row divided by some magic number 10 and on top of that i do believe that this particular index"
13557280,13561840," should have to be checked but not really yeah we'll need to check it properly"
13561840,13569760," easier a flag subscribe to street prime for seven months without any message but no message is required"
13569760,13575120," thank you so much for uh for subscribing thank you so much for supporting the channel and uh welcome"
13575120,13580720," back to our epic displacement club that's right we're doing a time displacement that's what we are all"
13580720,13588880," about is not epic is not epic i think it's pretty motherfucking epic anyway so what i want to do is uh save"
13588880,13595360," that index um it's basically an effective index or maybe it's going to be called displaced index"
13596000,13600400," it's going to be called displaced index and this is how we're going to displace that index"
13600400,13606000," and what's quite important chat is we need to check"
13606000,13614400," that the displaced index is less than the size of the frames and i have no idea if this is how"
13614400,13618160," you check the size of the slides i have no idea i don't program in rust so i'm going to just"
13618160,13623600," write in sudo code first and after that you just basically saying use displaced index"
13624880,13632560," like the further you go in the rows the more displaced the index become but at some point"
13632560,13638880," if the index goes outside of the size of the movie uh you're not going to copy anything so because yeah"
13638880,13644240," you you don't have enough information so basically trying to access uh like a wrong memory of some sort"
13644240,13651040," all right so do i need width here in this particular situation i don't need width here um do we have any"
13651040,13664480," professional uh rust developers how do you get the size of the slice is that is that just size let's"
13664480,13671120," actually go ahead and check if it if it works or not um all right so frames pixel uh local variable with"
13671120,13686080," the similar name uh it's frame slice len okay um let me go to this part okay len uh could not could not"
13686080,13692080," borrow self as immutable because it also also borrowed as mutable oh this one is very interesting would you"
13692080,13698400," look at that oh boy oh boy so"
13698400,13702480," index"
13702480,13708960," okay we can call it destination index dst index right"
13711520,13717120," and then put dst index here huh src index"
13717120,13724960," frame index is that what it wanted to do"
13724960,13732000," huh this is the weirdest shit ever"
13735120,13738800," like if you inline these variables it's not going to work"
13738800,13744880," so basically if you inline"
13744880,13753360," this shit like that it is considered as double borrowing so you're basically borrowing self here"
13753360,13761680," and here simultaneously that's what it is interesting which kind of makes sense because in c plus plus this"
13761680,13766080," kind of shit is usually considered undefined behavior right because you don't even know"
13766080,13772240," this function might might be modifying something within the pixels and then you refer to the pixels back"
13772240,13779600," and the order of the execution like it's not really known um so it's in c in c c plus plus it's usually"
13779600,13785920," undefined behavior but here it's it tries to avoid undefined behavior by actually sort of declaring this thing as"
13785920,13788640," double borrowing so we can't do that interesting"
13788640,13793280," um all right i mean i'm okay with that i mean sure"
13793280,13798480," i don't mind so we don't have rotate so i think i'm gonna do"
13798480,13802960," warn that code uh i don't really want to remove this code but i i don't want to"
13802960,13808560," i want this thing to bother me either method is not are you really serious"
13809920,13820880," what what what what what i just i just defined i just just defined no wait allow i think it's allowed"
13820880,13828960," yeah boy okay result okay so we also want to um uh unwrap this thing yeah"
13833680,13838240," shut shut shut are you ready for epic displacement"
13838240,13849360," um so i'm not sure uh what this thing should be called uh this particular 10 magic number"
13849360,13860800," i think it's a displacement step yeah i think it's it's a good name uh displacement step"
13862160,13866320," so i think it explains the is this is this displacement step"
13866320,13871280," who the hell is going on in the chats"
13871280,13874720," are you okay"
13874720,13883280," okay i see"
13885520,13889040," oh for fuck's sake jesus christ okay semicolon"
13889040,13897680," uh and you have to use use size i see every time so doing check in the chat is like"
13897680,13912240," okay i'm sorry uh all right so shut are you ready mate you're ready uh i'm not sure if i'm ready actually"
13913920,13921280," i'm gonna try it's gonna be weird as fuck it trust me it's gonna be weird um so here's the thing i want"
13921280,13928000," to actually do the following thing get clean fdx so we're gonna clean everything and we're gonna step"
13928000,13933040," through the uh through the instructions here so first thing we have to do we have to"
13934240,13942080," input exact extract input so we are extracting the uh the the frames we're slowly extracting them okay"
13942080,13948080," we extract the frames now we're gonna do cargo release and this one is the most dangerous step"
13948080,13952800," let's see for fuck's sake like i should have actually executed it in here i'm sorry i'm sorry"
13952800,13959360," everything's okay check uh i should have okay so oh it's recompiling everything from scratch now for some"
13959360,13963600," fucking reason i don't know why it decided to recompile everything but okay"
13963600,13972880," um prepares your popcorn to watch this show yes uh so we're loading the shit okay this is how much time"
13972880,13982480," it takes load we're displacing frames to their particular places and that's it okay let's take a look what the"
13982480,13988720," the fuck is going on there should we spoil and look at the frames before we compose them into the video"
13988720,13994400," what do you guys think should we look at those frames before composing the video so okay"
13994400,13998720," uh let's compose the final video"
14002000,14009280," oh good god damn it let's put compose okay"
14009280,14014080," we compose the final video"
14014080,14027520," let's watch the final video mp4"
14032000,14042000," it worked first of all first of all first of all it worked second of all i fucked up uh copying the"
14042000,14051520," yes i i fucked up i copy only red channel i just copied only the red channel which is understandable okay"
14052160,14057280," um so yes it looks like a murder show yes yes yes yes this is what it looks like"
14057280,14061440," he's he's cooking somebody actually"
14061440,14068720," you would never know what what what was in that pasta"
14068720,14071200," anyway so"
14071200,14080880," uh let's go back to this shit uh and to copy that shit properly chat"
14082480,14084480," i need to copy each individual channel"
14084480,14092640," like so right so it's plus zero then one two three and then it's going to be one two"
14092640,14101280," and then one two and only then then it probably will be okay so what we can do here i can actually"
14101280,14110320," do run cargo run release uh simultaneously here just as a single thing uh huh we're loading frames"
14110320,14112800," loading frames the slowest process apparently but"
14112800,14119040," we we also slowed down by the output of the of the utility but i think output is kind of important"
14119040,14122480," uh to see the progress i think it's kind of important"
14122480,14125360," uh and uh mplayer"
14125360,14134480," if you look at the lead you will see that it's actually working because it sort of bends"
14137600,14142800," yeah you see it sort of bends if you take a look at the original video it doesn't really bend that"
14142800,14149040," much like it doesn't bend at all so displacement actually works and we can um you know increase"
14149040,14152320," the level of displacement by reducing that displacement step"
14152320,14161360," so let's actually try to do that uh displacement step so it was 10 what if we make five right what if we"
14161360,14171840," make five so it's gonna look to the future more often uh because the moment of the thing is almost vertical yeah okay"
14175920,14186400," so loading loading loading loading um"
14186400,14205520," oh my god it like everything in the room bends oh it's kind of cool it's like sand of fish"
14206880,14207520," i like that"
14207520,14217600," that is so cool and listen okay uh what if we actually make it extreme"
14217600,14222560," like one frame each row each an individual row is going to be next frame"
14222560,14227840," each individual one it's like the maximum of bending like as much as it can go"
14228080,14235040," um so let's actually take a look at how we're looking at that uh there we go"
14235040,14239040," um"
14239040,14244000," instead of uh row"
14244000,14251280," i like the yeah when the top catches up what's what's interesting i was actually worried about that"
14252000,14258640," um so basically at the end since we're sort of tilted and we look at the future for some of the"
14258640,14267440," rows there is no frame there yes when we go into the end um there is just not nothing there"
14267440,14271200," and i was thinking how i'm gonna address that i'm gonna fill those rows with black"
14271200,14276640," i just decided to leave it there just i decided to leave the uh the rows of the previous frame"
14276640,14283440," and this is the reason why i use like sort of like in in place rendering which enables me with just"
14283440,14288400," uh leaving the traces of the previous frames and that actually solves the problems i'm uh automatically"
14288400,14300000," for me um oh my god"
14300000,14308800," this is beautiful"
14308800,14315360," this is actually super cool yes this is time displacement"
14316400,14317120," liquidly"
14317120,14323840," all right i think it's it's worth committing um"
14323840,14332880," uh do we have any other unfortunately i'm wasting so much time on this kind of stuff"
14332880,14346320," we need more interesting displacement algorithms because this is only one way"
14346320,14350480," you can displace it you can displace it not only by rows but for example by columns"
14350480,14357280," we can give it a try for example um i think it's going to be very similar to what we're trying to"
14357280,14359520," do like copy row but instead of copy column"
14359520,14369600," um copy call call but here we'll have to actually iterate uh rows"
14371600,14378400," uh-huh h uh rows the columns are available here and nothing actually here changes so it's actually the"
14378400,14383760," same thing and what we can do here we can swap what we're doing here instead of uh width we can"
14383760,14390560," hide instead of uh row we have column and displacement step is pretty much the same"
14391280,14397040," uh and instead of copying row we're copying column there we go so basically i just swapped everything"
14397040,14402880," around now we are displacing not by rows but actually by column so uh the the plane is tilted"
14402880,14408000," slightly differently uh let's give it a try and see if it's going to work or not uh all right"
14409520,14416640," it doesn't compile because why because this is how we have to do that um by column"
14419200,14425360," um yep so we're re-rendering it so now it's going to be displaced by column and let's see what's"
14425360,14430160," going to be more interesting um yeah okay"
14430160,14442160," um player let's go i think something up really really badly"
14448480,14461280," okay so i'm iterating each individual row by width i'm copying the column and maybe somewhere in"
14461280,14462240," copying the column"
14462240,14476960," yeah let's actually go back but where exactly i made a mistake let's go back let's go completely back"
14478240,14481280," and i have to be super super careful"
14481280,14489760," because i thought it's sort of symmetrical i thought it's symmetrical but through copy pasting i made"
14489760,14498240," somewhere a mistake uh i made somewhere in mistake so vodka just spit out on wraps why did you teach"
14498240,14499280," vodka on wraps"
14503040,14507120," god damn it chat god damn it stop teaching mr vodka"
14507120,14508800," bullshit"
14508800,14512880," uh all right whatever"
14512880,14520240," because to also to take three bites yeah well in our case at least"
14526880,14532720," player okay so here's the original thing i love it it's so good oh my god"
14532720,14537600," um i get my good my good my good my good my good um"
14537600,14543120," i mean if you're gonna abuse that every time you're trying to abuse the learning algorithm i'm going to"
14543120,14549840," change it for example i may filter out very long of uh words so yeah"
14552080,14558800," come on come on come on come on uh no fun is allowed"
14558800,14565920," i'm just joking by the way so let's actually try to think what the is going on so i'm trying to co"
14565920,14572720," to copy the column right so copying the column i can choose the column to copy the column i'll have to"
14572720,14579920," iterate the rows right i'll have to iterate the rows uh to iterate the rows i'll have to iterate it by"
14579920,14587280," height and here you go i'm iterating rows by height all right so this thing doesn't require any changes"
14587280,14593600," it doesn't require any changes and here we're just copying it so i don't see any problems here"
14594400,14601920," like it's just it is what it is it is what it is and the thing i probably want to actually preserve um"
14601920,14615200," uh yeah what um you used wrong variable call in four block back then right is that what you're talking"
14615200,14626160," about um okay so let's do the phone thing displace frame by row so this is how we're going to call it"
14626160,14634080," and we're going to make a copy of this thing displace frame by column right so in that particular situation"
14634080,14640240," and since we're displacing by column we have to iterate columns so it's going to be column uh width"
14640800,14653920," and here width width inside of that thing we're displacing index by current column right and then uh"
14653920,14660960," column all right and here what i'm all they have to do i have to displace by column"
14660960,14666480," so did i make any mistakes somewhere did i make any mistake somewhere"
14668320,14676240," um column column column column seems good to me we're iterating columns i didn't see anything"
14676240,14685040," and yes i did in fact make a mistake look at that here is the mistake copy by column uh yeah copy column"
14685040,14691840," uh all right yeah still copy row yeah i fixed that i think that thank you thank you thank you chat"
14691840,14697120," all right let's take a look let's take a look so we're displacing trying at least displacing by column and"
14697120,14701760," this time i didn't remove the previous algorithm that was a huge mistake that i made i should not remove"
14701760,14708800," that for some reason i keep removing the code i don't know why i think it's no it's still wrong so"
14708800,14713600," still wrong"
14718320,14723840," um"
14723840,14730320," ffmpeg you think it's ffmpeg let's actually take a look at the actual frames there uh yeah actual frames are"
14730320,14737360," like that actual frames are like that actual frames are like that for column in width maybe wait a second"
14737360,14747680," uh well i mean yes column iterates from left to right right so it's a it's this thing"
14748880,14754160," um index is the current index of the thing displacement step is that"
14754160,14765600," frames length displaced index and then i copy the column i didn't see any mistakes here that's what's"
14765600,14770640," interesting i didn't see any mistakes here do we have any mistakes here we copy the column to copy the"
14770640,14778160," column we'll have to iterate that column by rows so we iterate in the row and we have colon rows"
14778160,14785840," i don't see a mistake does column choose the correct column that's a good question"
14790880,14792080," but the rules work"
14792080,14803200," oh i know what's going on chat i know what's going on"
14803200,14810320," we may fix the problem yeah i i know exactly what's the problem uh let's let's put 10 here"
14813840,14817040," it's exactly the problem that i was trying to address uh with the rule yeah"
14817040,14822720," yeah i know what's the problem the code is correct the code is absolutely correct actually"
14822720,14828160," it's a fundamental problem of displacement my god this is so interesting"
14830720,14836320," so if you increase the step it may actually work yes it works"
14836320,14845200," so who knows what the is going on"
14847280,14856320," here's here are two interesting facts we have 300 frames 300 only 300 but"
14856320,14865680," the width of the image is twice as big as we have frames if we have a displacement step of one"
14865680,14874400," that mean only first frame we're gonna get to the half of the thing and we're gonna run out of frames"
14875360,14881360," exactly half of the frames right almost exactly i mean not exactly but i mean almost"
14881360,14889840," yeah so basically with this kind of width we don't have enough frames"
14889840,14897680," and because of that we have to increase the displacement step so"
14897680,14904080," we have to you know don't have to go to the future too much that's basically what we have to do"
14905360,14911600," uh yeah replace that sorting okay i can replace that if you want there we go"
14911600,14925120," yeah that one's actually pretty cool yeah at the end there is like a"
14925120,14933200," uh that's that's pretty cool so i wonder how much we can decrease like decrease the displacement step"
14933200,14938320," until it will become corrupted um yeah"
14938320,14949280," make both displacements at the same time yeah well i have to think how to do that that may require like"
14949280,14957280," so because you do displacements when you iterate rows or columns but now you will have to do"
14957280,14962880," displacement when you iterate individual row when you're copying it so that requires like"
14962880,14968640," very interesting well not really interesting magic but it will require reorganize the code i think"
14969680,14975280," so let's take a look okay okay i decrease the displacement step but uh not to the point when"
14975280,14981840," we ran out of frames uh so let's take a look at the whip that's a cool whip i like that"
14981840,14986560," nice so i think the time has come to actually commit whatever we have here um"
14992000,15000400," implement displacement row and column uh displacement and let's push that right into the ripon so all the"
15000400,15004880," code here is already available for for everybody you can find the source code that i'm writing here"
15004880,15015120," um in the chat so you can even try to compile all of that yourself um time displacement if you follow"
15015120,15020400," these instructions but before following these instructions i recommend to read you the"
15020400,15024720," implementations of these two scripts they are very simple they like a couple of lines but i still"
15024720,15028640," recommend you to read just to understand what is exactly going on and what kind of utilities we use"
15028640,15034480," there we use ffmpeg and that's it yeah we primarily use ffmpeg just you know just follow"
15034480,15041360," these instructions and it will you will be able to produce these kind of videos um all right so i already"
15041360,15046720," committed everything there hopefully uh let's try to see see what kind of other displacements we want to"
15046720,15057120," have um but i like to run a random bash scripts on my computer without looking looking them yeah i suppose"
15057120,15066880," uh okay let me think how we can do all of that so basically to do this displacement by both of the things"
15066880,15077120," the copy row and column should also know um should also know the whole movie so this thing right now"
15077120,15083680," these two things they don't look into the future but to do displacement by both of the dimensions we'll"
15083680,15090960," have to make them look into the future as well somehow i don't know how but we will have to do that"
15090960,15100640," uh but maybe we'll have to simply inline them yeah yeah i think the easiest way it would be uh to simply"
15100640,15112480," another display frame by roll call uh so we're going to take frames um all the frames here as a matter of fact"
15116000,15122640," index the current index that we want to generate and output frame is going to be immutable frame there"
15122640,15133520," we go so we'll need both width and height um okay so with h uh width height"
15133520,15139120," and uh we're going to iterate by rows i think iterating by rows is going to be interesting"
15140320,15144960," i do think so but the question is how we're going to even do all of that"
15144960,15152000," uh i think it's going to be super similar to just copying one frame to another one"
15152000,15155600," yeah it's pretty much copying one frame to another one"
15164160,15172480," but with some sort of displacement nice nice nice nice nice nice so here's the frame the frame here is"
15172480,15182880," uh this one is the output frame output frame this one is frames"
15186240,15195520," okay damn it where am i index and this is where we'll have to perform the displacement"
15195520,15200240," this is where we'll have to do that uh how we're going to perform the displacement"
15200240,15208080," uh displaced index displaced index it's going to be somewhere here"
15210160,15214880," uh uh so destination index is going to be uh-huh the"
15214880,15227440," so we have a very interesting kind of collision here we have a notion of"
15227440,15231760," pixel index and frame index"
15234240,15239760," because if i used pointers they would be typed oh my god this is uh"
15239760,15247840," this is genius rust borrow checker is forcing you to use void star at this point"
15247840,15255840," because i have two types of indexes indices and uh they on a type on save"
15255840,15260240," and it's the same as using void stars essentially"
15261680,15265120," this is amazing it's kind of difficult to explain but this is amazing"
15265120,15275360," yeah so i i need to this is what rust is forcing me to do nice"
15275360,15285920," uh so let's continue so displaced index is it's a frame index that's that's what's interesting about"
15285920,15289200," that so in this particular case i think i have to call this frame index"
15290240,15293440," i have to call this frame index and yeah"
15293440,15303280," yeah this moment when rust doesn't solve any problem yeah it didn't solve anything like at all"
15303280,15318240," uh gst pixel index so now we have"
15318240,15331920," how much time it will take to rust developers to realize that i wonder how much time it will take them to"
15331920,15336800," realize that well i mean some people already realize that but"
15339600,15354480," uh okay okay uh frame index so dst no no this one this is actually upsetting okay wait a second chat wait a"
15354480,15365120," second i'm gonna just reduce this thing ssc pixel index um and this uh here we're gonna have displaced uh frame index"
15365120,15381440," uh right uh displacement frame index there we go um so i will create a new programming language to fix the"
15381440,15389200," uh threading issues in rust uh i don't really experience threading issues right now but maybe i do but don't realize it"
15390320,15395360," because threading is so complex that maybe i'm experiencing multi-threading issues in a single"
15395360,15402160," threaded program all right so uh it doesn't compile of course so this is index this is a frame index"
15402160,15405200," uh and by the way so how are we going to displace it we have to displace it"
15405200,15412800," on um calls rows and calls simultaneously so we can try to do something like a row plus column and then"
15412800,15417520," displacement step but what's going to be the displacement step though oh furthermore we can try to extract the"
15417520,15422720," displacement step uh outside of all these functions i think that would be actually pretty interesting"
15422720,15429440," so basically extract all of them and this particular uh uh constant is going to control all of them"
15429440,15440160," so we're going to displace them by let's say 10 i suppose so basically even for each individual pixel"
15440160,15447440," it starts to go into into the future but because of that i think the this step has to be very big"
15447440,15455520," in my opinion i think it's it has to be like around 10 of some sort like a hundred um yeah i mean not"
15455520,15464240," it actually depends let's actually keep it 10. okay uh let's actually keep it 10 and let's try to compile that"
15465520,15472400," so it's not self yeah i'm i'm sorry it's not self self in this particular case is the output pixel output"
15472400,15481280," output frame okay pixel index and um oh god damn so src"
15481280,15486160," yeah this is the thing we're doing here"
15488320,15495680," okay okay dst frame index is a local variable with a similar name exists wait uh dst"
15495680,15508240," pixel index dst pixel index okay okay so we're doing that uh we're doing that we're loading up we're"
15508240,15515600," displacing everything so far we don't have any uh crashes which is nice and now we are composing the final"
15515600,15524240," thing we are composing the final thing uh all right are you chat ready so now we're just displacing"
15524240,15531760," simultaneously both by row and column so the the thing that scans the cube is actually tilted by both"
15531760,15534160," of them uh let's take a look"
15538960,15542960," it's not that different but i think i need to actually increase this step"
15542960,15552800," well yeah it feels like it's it feels like it's displaced by both of them yes that's what it feels"
15552800,15558480," like let's actually decrease it by half so maybe it will be even more noticeable than it was before"
15559120,15565760," let's decrease it uh code"
15565760,15578160," i have an idea i should actually uh append m player to the command so it should play instantly after it it's finished"
15578160,15584400," jesus you see it's it's actually really you start seeing how it's displayed by both of them"
15588080,15594400," okay so next thing we can make it even more extreme but making one and this time is gonna work"
15594400,15602800," i think oh maybe not maybe it's not gonna work yeah look what's gonna happen when we we can make it one"
15602800,15608480," i'm just thinking what if we wrap it around"
15608480,15615200," what if we wrap the video around okay so let me demonstrate what's gonna happen it's gonna be very"
15615200,15621520," interesting let me show you so then after m player and we're gonna do output mp4 and look look look"
15621520,15629920," okay i think i have an idea to solve that a black thingy problem um like black half of the screen"
15629920,15637520," of some sort diagonal displacement yeah you see so we have this kind of problem which is not acceptable"
15637520,15644240," one of the things we can do chat we can wrap the frames around the movie i think it's a pretty"
15644240,15654080," interesting solution and i wonder what kind of uh problems it will pose to us yeah so okay look uh"
15656400,15666880," mod uh frames length about that so it's gonna actually wrap around this entire but it can"
15666880,15676160," actually oh it will make it like really weird maybe we'll see we'll see uh you're not using by row"
15679360,15686720," yes god damn all of that yes my god that's cool thank you so much jesus christ"
15686720,15692480," okay so let's start over we're starting over we're setting the step to 10"
15692480,15695200," um"
15695200,15697840," and"
15697840,15702000," you see this is why i'm unemployed by the way"
15702640,15708640," uh i'm not only slow developer i'm actually i'm actually introducing way too many bugs"
15708640,15714240," um so that that's exactly why i'm unemployed okay let's try to recompile it it doesn't even"
15714240,15718800," i get them uh closing uh uh"
15726320,15732400," displace how is it called did i call it differently displace yeah displace"
15732400,15736480," okay come on come on come on"
15736480,15740560," let's do it let's do it boys and girls let's do it"
15740560,15744640," displacing already displacing already displacing"
15744640,15751840," um there we go out of bound um"
15753600,15767600," let's let's still introduce mod i think the mod would be actually pretty good friends uh"
15767600,15772160," i mean it's safe like instead of uh"
15772160,15777680," letting you buffer flow it potentially uh let uh attackers to"
15777680,15782320," execute code it just crashed all right"
15783600,15793680," have you seen that line this is wrapping around"
15793680,15795680," this is what wrapping around didn't"
15795680,15798640," isn't that cool i think it's pretty cool"
15798640,15803360," so you could have actually seen how it's wrapped around this that's actually pretty interesting"
15803360,15810320," so now displacement step is going to be one let's see how it's going to go"
15812880,15814000," displacement step"
15814000,15835120," apply to a seamlessly looping video probably maybe maybe we should do that"
15835120,15845600," my god that was epic"
15845600,15847680," my god that was epic"
15847680,15855120," all right so let's commit whatever we have"
15856640,15866720," um all right implement displacement by both row and colon let's push that right into the ribbon"
15866720,15870320," all right so what do i want to do boys and girls what i want to do"
15870320,15881200," i want to set up a reasonable defaults for example with displacement one and displacement by row"
15881920,15887120," i think it works relatively great so this is going to be our default thingy imaging"
15887120,15889840," um yeah"
15889840,15899120," chief wants to smash that lid on a pasta plate probably this is probably what they want"
15900240,15908320," and on top of that i want to construct like a high quality gif out of that i think constructing a high"
15908320,15913040," quality gif out of that will be actually pretty cool so let me show how we're going to do that"
15913600,15921520," um reasonable reasonable reasonable defaults i'm going to push that right into the repo so um"
15921520,15931840," ffmpeg gif high quality i already did that and there is a pretty cool blog post that explains how"
15931840,15941200," to um how to do like higher quality gifs and i'm not even sure uh ffmpeg gif quality"
15941200,15950880," and of course that go isn't capable of finding that blog post because it's uh unusable all right"
15950880,15956960," let me show you what i'm going to do ffmpeg gif quality uh high quality gif with ffmpega"
15958640,15961440," uh huh this is bullshit"
15961440,15974000," engineering gifing god damn like i remember oh my god okay so maybe it's in that super user thing"
15974000,15987760," the problem with that thing is that it requires like two-step um two-step conversion"
15988640,15998400," um recent post so first you'll probably have to generate a palette out of that um yeah"
15998400,16007040," like the proper palette because i really want to make a gif out of that so to demonstrate how you can"
16007040,16013120," do that uh so this doesn't work this doesn't work animation if i'm going to high quality um"
16016320,16022560," gif ski i don't have a gif ski like it doesn't really work on uh on linux this explains it well"
16022560,16028720," yes here it is here's the blog post like you seriously this blocks a blog post is amazing"
16028720,16035360," it actually explains you how to do that um yeah basically what you do you use this uh script"
16035360,16043440," seriously uh you do that in two steps first you have to generate a palette like optimal palette"
16043920,16048800," for for for all of your frames it needs to analyze the palette and after analyzing that you apply"
16048800,16056000," that palette and it actually generates you like a relatively uh relatively good gif uh so basically"
16056000,16061920," if you if you can bookmark this thing and or maybe save that script because this shed is amazing i'm"
16061920,16071280," telling you um so what we're going to do uh gif and code sh uh so we're going to save it in the temporary"
16071280,16074880," thing do i want to scale anything do i want to scale anything i'm not even sure if i want to scale that"
16074880,16081440," thing but let's keep it scaled because why not um and the input in our case by the way is going to be"
16081440,16089920," not just that but maybe maybe yes maybe it's going to be that so uh gif encoding is going to be maybe i'm"
16089920,16101200," maybe i'm going to even include that thing uh stolen from here so um yes gif encode"
16101200,16105120," gif encode"
16105120,16116800," by the way it uses where does it output that oh it you have to provide both input and output gif encoding output"
16116880,16123840," 0 4 d p and g and the output is going to be demo gif"
16123840,16126960," demo gif"
16126960,16130880," set"
16130880,16139040," all right there we go so it's going to take some time"
16141040,16143840," but hopefully it will generate like a reasonable"
16143840,16146240," reasonable gif"
16146240,16153200," so i just noticed that it uses fps 15 which is not ideal so but let's take a look"
16153200,16155360," at the generator thank you"
16155360,16160160," i guess it's okay"
16163520,16169360," i i want a little bit maybe it seems it's two megabytes maybe it's not super ideal"
16169360,16174560," uh like it's already pretty big that's the main problem of this thing"
16174560,16181440," give from coding so what we can do here what if we do 30 let's give it a 30"
16187840,16196080," okay"
16196080,16205120," well i think it's a little bit better like 13 around that"
16211520,16216320," and the size of this thing is four megabytes can we afford uh actually committing four megabyte to"
16216320,16220560," this repo i think we can i think we actually can i mean why not"
16226080,16230160," and we can do this demo like that demo gif"
16230160,16239840," add demo gif let's push that right into the rhythm"
16239840,16243520," uh all right chat all right chat so if i refresh that"
16243520,16246640," refresh"
16248640,16256640," uh get them take some time oh god it actually it actually up i thought okay wait a second i didn't"
16256640,16260640," realize that it has some sort of some sort of problem is that something for with the output"
16260640,16266160," it looks like yeah output up a little bit i see"
16273120,16280880," so let's try to fix that super quick um let's make the displacement yeah displacement one was actually"
16280880,16286480," a mistake uh let's change the displacement"
16296960,16302960," so uh if you take a look at this thing now i think it's yeah i think it's full now so everything seems"
16302960,16307120," to be okay does it it doesn't really demonstrate that much"
16307120,16313120," i guess that's okay i guess that's okay"
16313120,16322160," well i mean that that that particular gif is probably okay it's kind of up but for um yeah for our"
16322160,16327840," case it's okay so this is the result of today's stream so we managed to do like a little bit of"
16327840,16333840," time displacement in rust i wish i had more time to do more interesting time displacement because"
16333840,16340320," the plane is not necessarily has to be flat you can make the plane some sort of a function that"
16340320,16344960," bends around and stuff like that like bends continuously and you can do very interesting"
16344960,16349920," shit very epic and interesting shit but this is the result of today's stream i think today's"
16349920,16356800," stream was interesting i want to try that simple thing out for quite some time already um yeah"
16356800,16363440," so i hope you found today's stream interesting and yeah that's it for the day boys and girls that's it for"
