960,8080," hello and welcome to another zozin session how about that about that but you didn't expect that"
8080,15520," to happen so today is uh friday if i'm not mistaken i think today is friday and i want to"
15520,24000," kind of get back to a stable schedule where i have like a well-defined uh projects on the well-defined"
24000,31600," days of the week so on the friday we usually do a random one-off stream and uh that's precisely"
31600,40400," what i wanted to do today i wanted to do something random and one time right so i've been programming"
40400,45760," in pure c for quite some time already and it's actually kind of freaking boring to use the same"
45760,52800," language all the time uh even though there's not that much that many replacement languages for c"
52800,58880," for c unfortunately a lot of people claim that they managed to come up with the killer of c uh"
58880,64960," and the people were claiming that over the past of several decades right so people were trying to kill"
64960,73360," c since 80s i suppose still can't do that well like unfortunately i wish we could finally get rid of that"
73360,82560," stupid language but unfortunately nobody can finally kill uh c so um the language of today uh is nim i"
82560,87360," probably in that language long time ago actually when i was developing a boomer for those who"
87360,94800," doesn't know boomer is this thing that can zoom in and zoom out it is written in fact in nim programming"
94800,100720," language uh so maybe i'm gonna actually give the links to all of that stuff in the description for"
100720,109360," lovely people who's watching me on uh youtube and of course if you are brave enough to watch me on twitch"
110160,114960," i'm gonna give the link in the in the chat as well just for you for the brave people at twitch"
114960,122560," for the brave people at twitch who is not afraid to look at zozin life by the way hello brave people"
122560,131040," hello uh free food i could duke an oligor rastafarian mr bodka sodding hello hello everyone who i can see in"
131040,136960," the chat welcome welcome welcome welcome nim programming uh maybe i want to disable the white"
136960,143840," spaces nim programming uh language now we go so here's the new programming language and the source"
143840,148720," code of this thing that can zoom in and zoom out it's available on the starting organization believe"
148720,154800," it or not it's called boomer and the reason why it's called boomer is because it's a zoomer application for"
154800,165920," linux that's right uh so let's put it here boomer uh application uh and i'm gonna put it in here and"
165920,172560," of course for brave people at uh twitch here it is here is the thing that you can download"
173680,179920," so uh what version of nim i even use uh i don't really know so let me see how you're supposed to"
179920,186640," do it like that uh active boot switch derelease something something i'm not sure if it fails with"
186640,194160," anything uh yeah yeah so it doesn't apparently doesn't really care it's a really strange flag uh but"
194160,204400," yeah so the version is 1.04 compiled that 2019 two years ago i have a two years old uh version of nim"
204400,210480," for linux amd64 so where is it installed by the way is it installed somewhere here i think this is where"
210480,217680," it's installed uh so maybe the time has come to upgrade my my new so because the the latest version"
217680,227440," is apparently 1.4.8 all right i think the time has freaking come python ada modular some other"
227440,235920," shit anyway so let's install new uh so what operating system do we use do we use windows or do we use unix"
235920,246080," uh i think we're using unix uh pre-built binaries for linux okay so we're using x86-64 if i'm not"
246080,253680," mistaken so let's download this thing that is it apparently um okay that was fast i'm not gonna"
253680,264400," lie uh so and i wonder uh like it is installed in opt do i keep all of my archives in opt i think i do"
264400,273680," uh i i saw new media apparently oh i do apparently i do have a more or less latest version it's just like"
274240,281360," uh yeah my config is not redirected to it but i mean i think it makes sense to actually uh use the latest"
281360,287760," latest version right so let's quickly do that uh to do that i probably have to do into like go into the"
287760,294800," root right so let's quickly do that um you know what i think this is how i'm going to be doing that right"
294800,302240," so now i'm root look at that look at that i'm using a root console on the machine from which i'm streaming"
302240,311680," right now this is the content you all subscribed for look at that i'm also streaming from this machine"
311680,318880," and i have the root access post anything in the chat i'm gonna copy paste it into this command prompt i'm"
318880,324160," joking i'm not gonna do that so uh okay let's actually go ahead and take this entire thing and"
324160,332400," i'm gonna do you get uh this thing in here there we go we're downloading and i'm gonna just do tar fvx"
332400,342960," um boom there we go so it's unpacking stuff and now i'm actually exiting the root console uh i'm actually"
342960,351120," exiting the root console okay so uh now i'm gonna go to my bash let me actually double check if my bash"
351120,360480," does not contain anything sensitive i don't think it does uh but i'm gonna modify it um outside of the"
360480,372960," screen anyway just in case you know just in case just in case all right so i need to restart my console"
372960,379120," so now if i take a look at the version of neem now we have the latest and greatest version"
379120,384320," of a name compiler that was built in 2021 recently"
384320,389040," recently pretty produceable"
389040,396240," okay"
409120,419280," so team mux all right so let's take a look at this stuff uh so let's do how should i call my"
419280,423920," project i don't know so i'm gonna call it wank tiles all right so it's gonna be wank tiles and let's"
423920,433200," actually test uh you know the new installation of uh new compiler uh new installation of the new compiler"
433200,440080," uh so i think i also probably want to update my new mode in emacs because maybe uh they will introduce"
440080,446160," like introduce like new stuff in there um right so i think it's something like proc"
447360,455120," uh and i do remember that uh the entry point in nim is something like when is main module right when is"
455120,461520," main module and this is where you put all of your hello worlds and stuff like that uh right so let's also"
461520,469120," remove white spaces and if i run nim and i think i have to do something like c will that work will that work"
469120,477280," um i think it worked uh and uh here is the executable look at that it's a beautiful beautiful executable"
477280,482640," so and the executable is dynamically linked unfortunately it doesn't produce statically"
482640,490400," linked executable so let's take a look at what it depends on it only depends on libc and dl and nothing"
490400,498000," more than that so that's fine so and now we can just run uh this executable and here is a hello world"
498000,505600," here is a hello world uh it's also pretty lean by the way yeah because i think c a compiler produces"
505600,514480," bigger executables i don't know maybe maybe this so uh yeah i wanted to actually maybe update the new mode"
515840,522720," uh where is the new mode how do you update things i don't remember um oh my god it's so slow because"
522720,528000," it's a you know downloading the list of packages and there's too many packages there's five thousand"
528000,537520," 393 packages in uh emacs repositories that's a lot of packages well it's not actually it's just like emacs is"
537520,544640," slow uh all the applications in 2021 are slow because people don't realize that 5 000 things is not that"
544640,551280," big of a number but anyway uh meme mode it's installed does it require any updates"
551280,558160," how can we know if it requires any updates i think to update everything you have to press shift u"
558160,564400," and it's sort of marks uh everything that needs to be updated and if i take a look at new mode"
564400,573520," uh funny enough new new mode was yeah was never updated recently nobody programs in neem on emacs"
573520,580320," apparently this is actually really interesting nobody uses this i mean i do understand that uh"
580320,588720," i don't program on neem usually either so i think it's only fair uh new mode yeah so it's the latest"
588720,597120," version was in 2019 precisely the version of neem i was using by the way uh precisely and it doesn't even"
597120,605920," build and yeah it's just like nobody's using this anymore unfortunately it is in fact dead dead"
608640,617120," it is in fact that imagine programming this language with this support yikes yikes yikes yikes yikes yikes"
617120,625760," anyway so we're gonna be using all the s new mode for for emacs uh all right so what the is weighing tiles"
625760,630480," you're probably asking my friends right what the is weighing tiles let's actually google it up"
630480,634880," weighing tiles um so"
634880,643600," weighing tiles uh first proposed by a mathematician logician the philosopher how young in the class"
646960,652080," okay so let's take a look at something better i think somewhere here it is explained a little bit"
652080,659360," better the idea of weighing tiles is extremely simple right so the simple case of weighing tiles is"
659360,667440," basically uh you have uh square tiles right you have square tiles with four sides right you have four"
667440,674080," sides and you are not allowed to rotate these styles right so you have to place them as they are there is"
674080,682800," no reason to rotate them and in a simple case in a very simple case on each side on each side you have two"
682800,690000," colors each side it can be either one color in in this particular case it is uh as you can see blue or it"
690000,695840," could be yellow right uh blue or yellow uh you can actually make it more complicated you can add more"
695840,701360," colors you can uh instead of sides you can use corners but the idea is going to be pretty much the same"
701360,708480," right so and how can you place the tiles you can only place the tiles with uh the corresponding sides"
709200,715840," matching with the corresponding side matching with the color right and here is an interesting thing um"
715840,726640," you have four sides and two colors right so four sides and two colors so that means you can encode"
726640,735760," a single tile like this a single tile like this with four bits zero representing uh first color one"
735760,741920," representing um second color right so we have four bits of information each individual tile is four"
741920,748720," bits of information so uh if you basically cover all of the possible combination of bits you're going to"
748720,756560," have 16 tiles right you're going to have 16 tiles and 16 tiles in this particular specific configuration"
756560,762480," in the configuration of using sides and having two colors this is going to be called a full set of"
762480,770160," wang tiles as far as no it's a full set so and you know what's cool about it is that if you have"
770160,784880," a full set of wang tiles right uh and for instance um uh you have a tile that you want to place in right you"
784880,792720," have a cell into which you want to place a thing and you already have uh four neighboring tiles you already"
792720,804240," have four neighboring tiles like this uh and these four neighboring tiles they're already placed and they're"
804240,810560," completely random they're completely random so on uh this side you have zero color on this side you have one"
810560,818880," color maybe another one and another zero so if you have a full set of wang tiles no matter what kind of"
818880,825600," tiles you place in here you will always have a tile to place in here because you have a full set because"
825600,831520," you have all the possible combinations of zeros and ones right you can always place like you can always"
831520,838400," find the tile that matches in here right you have 16 of them which makes it super easy to generate random"
838400,847440," patterns right you have a grid uh you start with a random tile then uh knowing the neighboring colors"
847440,853440," in here you can match another tile in here right you can put another tile in here which consists of"
853440,859040," something like this and then you can uh put another tile in here that matches in here and uh that limits how"
859040,863360," many tiles you can place in here but you can always place a new tile in here and you can basically"
863360,871920," randomly procedurally generate different patterns uh neighboring edges must be equal right yes i"
871920,877520," precisely mentioned that at the beginning of the explanation it's a part of the definition of uh wang tiles"
877520,885840," and uh if you have this specific uh set of uh wang tiles uh you can generate patterns like this so number"
885840,890880," here as far as i know it just represents the number of like the the bits right the beat number the beat"
890880,900320," mask uh and what's interesting is that you are not um color is more of a metaphorical thing it does not"
900320,908240," necessarily have to be a color you can draw them so they form some sort of tubes or they form some sort of"
908240,914000," labyrinths and stuff like that there's a lot of examples in this particular website so let's actually uh click"
914000,921520," around i think it's a wang 3e uh right so there's a lot of different um i wonder if there is where is the"
921520,929040," there was it yeah so you can have tiles that looks like this right that generate roads and stuff like"
929040,935360," that right so but the tiles obey the law of matching with other tiles and you have like a full set of them"
936080,942160," uh right so and as far as i know on this website uh they had yeah they had a generator for different"
942160,947040," things for instance uh this one is not really that interesting i think block four is the most"
947040,952480," interesting one yeah so you can generate patterns like this uh right or you can generate something like"
952480,959520," that um so yeah and all of that is generated with wang tiles right so but you need to have a"
959520,966080," predefined set of wang tiles uh to actually match all that so there's a lot of interesting things in here"
966080,973920," um yep so and as far as i know this idea is used quite heavily in game development for procedural"
973920,981600," generation of levels right um and again you not necessarily have to have only two colors"
982400,987840," you can have three of them right but in that case instead of having like a binary system where we have"
987840,996560," zero zero zero zero zero zero one uh zero zero one zero and so on and so forth right you're gonna have"
996560,1004800," a ternary system right so this stuff is gonna go from zero uh zero zero zero one zero zero zero zero two"
1004800,1009840," and so on and so forth you can still represent all of that with beat masks if you allocate enough"
1009840,1017120," beats um but yeah it's basically playing with different uh numerical systems right so representation"
1017120,1022800," of the styles is basically going to be playing with different numerical systems and then uh v2k thank"
1022800,1028800," you so much for tier one subscription thank you thank you thank you i really appreciate it so yeah uh the"
1028800,1037280," basic system is uh essentially two colors that form a four-bit uh number set and for each number here you"
1037280,1043440," create a tile and then generation of uh a tile basically like covering everything with the tile"
1043440,1048880," becomes trivial right you just match the corresponding bits you can make it complicated to get made or add"
1048880,1055200," more colors in that case uh maybe you're going to have a different representation and so on and so forth"
1055200,1060080," okay so this is wank tiles i'm going to leave the link to this website this is actually a very cool"
1060080,1065600," website uh believe it or not uh i really really enjoyed it um so you can find it in here and for"
1065600,1070000," the lovely people on youtube i'm going to put all of that in the description"
1072000,1083520," uh so cool website with uh wank tiles and stuff okay so that's basically what it is and what i want"
1083520,1094320," you to do actually what i wanted to do i on top of uh generating grid of tiles i also want you to try to"
1094320,1104320," generate the tiles themselves right so what if we generate everything not only the uh the tile"
1104320,1111120," like uh you know the grid uh but also the tiles themselves right and uh we can actually go with a"
1111120,1118880," very simple uh case where we can generate gradients for each of the sites right so uh essentially maybe"
1118880,1126000," we're going to have something like like this so one color is going to be like uh a circular gradient"
1126000,1132320," on one side where it starts to grow from the center in here and slowly fades away towards the center"
1132320,1138720," uh somewhere here and then the other side is going to be actually kind of similar uh and it's also going"
1138720,1145920," to fade away toward the center and uh we can generate all of these gradient tiles procedurally and then"
1145920,1151040," match them together and maybe create interesting patterns with wank tiles you see what i'm talking"
1151040,1158320," about right so i wanted to generate like everything from scratch uh down to each individual pixel right"
1158320,1165600," so once we generated a set of wank tiles 16 of them uh we can go ahead and generate a grid and save it"
1165600,1166000," somewhere"
1166000,1174240," using something like opengl slash sdl uh will it be live rendering uh i mean"
1174960,1181680," sdl and opengl is kind of like a dependency uh when dependency make life actually more difficult"
1181680,1186160," because you have to interface with them you have to install them and stuff like that so what i was"
1186160,1192080," thinking i was thinking that maybe we can generate everything on the level of pixels and just dump it as"
1192080,1201520," an image uh ppm yeah we can actually dump that as a ppm file that way um that way we don't have we"
1201520,1207360," can do that in literally any language without worrying about dependencies right so that way we basically"
1207360,1213360," implement everything ourselves so that's what i wanted to do so i'm not sure if how successful we're"
1213360,1217280," going to be with this entire stuff but i think it's going to be interesting i think it's going to be"
1217280,1227040," interesting um so and it would be kind of useful to have uh like shaders for writing gradients but the"
1227040,1236640," thing is uh you don't really need to uh have opengl to do things that you do in shaders you can do the"
1236640,1246000," same stuff on uh on cpu in fact opengl doesn't really do anything uh special that you can't do on cpu"
1246000,1251920," the only thing gpu does is just does these things faster right and if we're not generating animations"
1251920,1258240," like uh 7 000 frames per second maybe it doesn't really matter and we can do all that on cpu and"
1258240,1266400," you can probably still in the same style as with um at with shaders right so um let's actually give it a"
1266400,1272640," try let's actually try to write cpu shaders if you know what i'm talking about let's try to write cpu shaders"
1274720,1283360," oh boy oh boy oh boy where is my soy okay so uh what was the wank tiles right i call this entire thing"
1283360,1291520," wank tiles okay so can i have constants like width and height so can i say like that width is going to"
1291520,1299200," be 64 and height is going to be 64. is that the thing i can do so can i also simultaneously run the"
1299200,1306320," entire thing uh write something like this uh as far as i know i can do c right but that only compiles"
1306320,1315520," this thing can i uh compile it and run it let's take a look at the help uh see okay so compile to run"
1315520,1324080," uh okay so maybe uh we can do something like r main.nim and everything seems to be working okay so that"
1324080,1327920," thing actually compiled and simultaneously run it so this is going to be super useful"
1328880,1338480," this is going to be super useful all right so uh we need to open the file somehow um so"
1338480,1349760," nim uh write to file i forgot how to write to file it's something like io okay so we probably have to"
1349760,1358720," import uh io um so and then we need to find the function open right so here is the open file"
1358720,1368000," function uh and within that function as far as you can see uh so it accepts the file um"
1368000,1373920," but that is very very strange is there a function okay so here's the function that returns the file so"
1373920,1379440," the cool thing about nim is that you can overload functions you have different variants uh like for"
1379440,1386000," different sort of situations and you can basically overload all of that right so we can save that in here"
1386000,1397120," uh then the file path uh so let's actually call it something like output ppm right so for mode uh i think"
1397120,1404640," we're gonna use uh right right it's basically fm right so here is the right mode and the buffer size"
1404640,1411200," probably doesn't matter and that is basically it as far as i can tell so and at the end we have to close the"
1411200,1417600," file so i'm pretty sure there is a function to close the file there we go uh okay there we go so we can"
1417600,1425680," just go ahead and close it uh as far as i know um nim has a defer statement so you can actually do something"
1425680,1432960," like defer to like defer name defer like in go by the way like in go isn't that cool it's almost like go"
1432960,1440800," that's pretty pogue the first statement uh yeah you have to actually put the colon in here and that"
1440800,1449680," thing will uh will happen at the end of the scope furthermore um as far as i know nim has like a universal"
1449680,1459680," call syntax essentially this and this are equal so if you have a function that accepts a first argument"
1459680,1465120," you can take that first argument and put it at the beginning place a dot in here and call it and these"
1465120,1472880," two things are absolutely equivalent right so the language doesn't have classes at all right it has"
1472880,1479680," something that that is called objects but they're basically structures and uh op in this language is"
1479680,1485600," basically syntax sugar is just a way to call a function right so there's basically no op in here"
1485600,1491600," only things that look like you calling methods and in fact in reality op just turns into procedural"
1491600,1498000," programming with just a syntax sugar on chaining different things right so this is basically what it"
1498000,1506480," usually turns to um similar to go but in in in go you have to specifically define the functions to be"
1506480,1512960," methods if you know what i'm talking about you have to specifically say that there are methods in uh in"
1512960,1521360," nim you can just take a function and if it if it accepts the first argument you can just use it like that"
1521360,1526800," you don't have to specifically define it right it's just like yeah it just works like this it's just two"
1526800,1530400," alternative syntaxes um right"
1530400,1543680," what is this language i put the name of the language in title it's goal all right so and uh yeah essentially"
1543680,1549200," i can do something like uh close and as far as i know parentheses are also optional right so but i don't"
1549200,1565680," don't remember okay so and after that uh i think we also have to have a right right so uh where is the"
1565680,1574560," right function uh where is the right function to to to this is not particularly convenient to search in"
1574560,1582960," unfortunately uh to to so let me try to search for this thing i wish the communication was a little"
1582960,1589200," better but here it is uh i can actually save a single character which is nice so because we're going to be"
1589200,1597920," writing bytes in there okay so what we want to do we want to save our images in uh a format uh that is called ppm"
1598960,1611360," have you guys heard about ppm uh okay uh ppm image right there we go so it's a net bpm and specifically"
1611360,1619280," i want to use a variation that is called p6 right so because it allows me to uh dump in a binary format"
1619280,1624720," uh in rgb um so it makes it a little bit more compressed if you if you know what i'm talking"
1624720,1629440," about but i mean it's not going to be super compressed because there's no compression in there it's just not"
1629440,1636000," going to take as much space as any of the ascii formats because ascii formats usually take more uh"
1636000,1641120," space to represent the pixel right if i remember correctly uh the way you work with that uh you do"
1641120,1648080," something like write ln right and you have to first put a magic symbol in here right so it's called p6"
1648640,1658240," uh and then you have to put uh the size of the image and i don't remember how you actually format"
1658240,1663200," strings in uh in nim uh do you have some sort of like a string interpolation i don't remember"
1663200,1673600," string interpolation of our nation uh so there's the str format uh okay so you just have to you just"
1673600,1681360," have to import uh this entire thing right so input str format str format and then you can put some sort"
1681360,1687360," of an interpolator in front of this entire thing right and then just use width then you can use"
1687360,1692560," height and then you have to put 255 but then remember what it means i think it's amount of it's"
1692560,1699200," the range of each individual um channel right i think that's what it is i think it's a range of each"
1699200,1706560," new job but i'm not sure uh so let's actually try to run the program already right so it cannot open"
1706560,1718560," file io uh which is kind of strange um so it happened oh yeah because it couldn't actually import io"
1719280,1728880," all right uh this is a part of oh okay so uh you have to import system not io uh okay so it's doing"
1728880,1737360," things uh the first statement not supported at top level really oh that is very interesting okay so"
1737360,1743040," let's create maybe uh some sort of a main uh where we're gonna move everything in here so here is the"
1743040,1749920," main function and then we can call main uh are you gonna be happy now hopefully uh express expected but"
1749920,1762800," found uh let keyword uh so how do we define procedures i think uh to tune in proc let's actually"
1762800,1769760," see uh new tutorial uh this one is going to be proc uh procedures how do you define procedures so it's"
1769760,1775040," going to be proc and has to be equal apparently right if you if i don't accept any arguments maybe i have"
1775040,1780240," to do something like this i think i think that's what i have to do but i'm not sure uh okay attempted"
1780240,1787760," to call um undeclared routine right ln um okay that's really interesting so i know that there is a"
1787760,1793280," routine uh right so in if there is just routine right that means i have to put a new lines in here"
1793280,1802480," right is that what's what's going on uh main is of type proc uh and has to be or discarded oh yeah okay"
1802480,1816240," here is an interesting thing um uh i suppose i have to explicitly say that this thing does"
1816240,1826080," not return anything right so the type of this thing is unit right um okay new unit why the"
1826080,1831200," fuck we means is nim so complicated why do you think it is complicated i don't quite understand"
1831200,1834480," um void type"
1834480,1846320," so what exactly made you think that it is complicated what precisely tell me tell me more about it why do"
1846320,1847600," you think it is complicated"
1850400,1855680," it has a pepega docs uh bit it's not complicated yeah it's actually pretty simple language it's just"
1855680,1863280," like uh the documentation is uh in fact really really pepega uh so much work to define a call in"
1863280,1870000," function really it doesn't look like that much work look look to define a full encounter call in function"
1870000,1877520," all right so in c plus plus you have to have template type name t then you have to have"
1877520,1884880," const expression then void then look look at all that stuff look at all that stuff so"
1884880,1895200," no you're wrong i would say this is straight up not true so i i don't know where you're coming from to be fair"
1895200,1902080," right so where do you see complexity so you say it's complicated that means you see complexity"
1902080,1907840," somewhere i literally don't see complexity to be fair what i see is that i don't really know how to do that"
1907840,1916400," right and yeah yeah no exception yeah no exception const don't forget the const if you are inside of the class"
1916400,1923200," right so this is complicated this is straight of complicated this is no i just like don't know how to do that"
1923200,1929280," because i haven't programmed that language for very long so yeah it doesn't look that complicated to me"
1929280,1937280," um all right so let me let me see so i think it wants something like discarding here but i don't really"
1937280,1944800," know why it wants to discard because i don't really return anything in here right especially man has no type"
1944800,1953120," or is ambiguous okay so yeah it has no type or ambiguous uh all right so"
1953120,1966000," i do remember yeah it has to be just this uh and it should just work but for some reason it doesn't"
1966000,1974320," it doesn't really work so let's actually see um okay so it does work so it just does not allow me to"
1974320,1979360," properly call this function for some reason um so i don't really know why"
1981520,1990240," uh oh now it works so if i when i was trying to do this thing i don't know what was the problem to"
1990240,1996000," be fair now it works all of a sudden i probably forgot to save the file somewhere right i probably"
1996000,2003440," forgot to save the file but apart from that uh yeah so now we have a ppm and if we take a look at what"
2003440,2011200," uh printed in here it actually printed slash n and uh to be fair i'm not sure why uh probably because"
2011200,2018000," the formatter uh sort of didn't have like a new line or something but you know what i wish there was like"
2018000,2022800," right new line if you know what i'm talking about i wish i could just use right new line in here"
2022800,2027040," uh and it would work but unfortunately it doesn't work like that so"
2028640,2035280," unfortunately it doesn't work so oh it's a right line like you see it's it's a very complicated"
2035280,2046880," language right very very complicated language okay all right so now uh there we go now we have that"
2046880,2052800," so the next thing you can do we figured out how to do all of this so which which is pretty cool"
2053840,2059520," um we need to do a for loop all right so we're going to iterate uh by rows right so we're going"
2059520,2066720," to do y in i think this is how we iterate from zero to height right and if i iterate from zero to height"
2066720,2072800," i think it does not include the last element in here but i'm not sure so let's actually try to run this"
2072800,2079520," entire thing and see so oh it did in fact include the last element you see it has zero at the beginning"
2079520,2085520," and 64 at the end right so and then i think you have to do it like that to indicate that you don't"
2085520,2092320," want the last element i think yeah it's almost like in rust i think um no no in rust it's actually by"
2092320,2098000," default like that but in here we have to do it like that which is pretty convenient okay so waiting rating"
2098000,2104320," um you know by rows and then we're going to be iterating the columns right so here we go we are"
2104320,2114000," iterating the columns so and for each column we can print uh probably is neem one indexed um i think it"
2114000,2119360," doesn't matter in you i think you can have arrays that are in this differently all right"
2122000,2139840," so uh okay neem arrays define array i probably should yeah array neem by example uh so yeah you can"
2139840,2145040," basically define your own ranges if you want to so it doesn't matter just like in pascal in pascal it"
2145040,2151280," doesn't matter because uh you basically define whatever range you want right so you want a zero"
2151280,2156480," base it's it's gonna be zero based if you want one base it's gonna be one base it just doesn't matter"
2156480,2161760," uh right so so this is how we usually do that"
2167600,2173840," but why does it have to use camel case well it doesn't have to use camel case look look i'm gonna"
2173840,2181360," show you something you can do something like this uh and it will still work uh nested statement"
2181360,2188240," requirement oh yeah so basically i have to actually do discard right so it failed in here all right so"
2188240,2193120," and it should work yeah it still compiles i can do it like that i can use uh you know snake case it doesn't"
2193120,2198080," matter"
2198080,2210720," you know why you know why first of all neem is case insensitive right it's cancer sensitive you can use"
2210720,2216720," whatever the you want for names um except starting with a capital letter right so you can use whatever"
2216720,2224080," capitalization you want right so you can even do it like that uh and on top of that it also ignores"
2224080,2230560," all of the underscores in the names making it style insensitive invalid token trail and score"
2230560,2236560," maybe you cannot do that but as far as i know i think you can basically place how many underscores you"
2236560,2242960," want i think that will work yeah that will work so it makes it style insensitive so if you want to use"
2242960,2248720," camel case use camel case if you want to use snake case use snake case like it's a style insensitive do"
2248720,2256960," whatever the you want right it doesn't have to use camel case right so"
2264480,2271360," but the only limitation to that rule is that you cannot do this so the first letter is important"
2271360,2279040," because the first capital letter indicates the type and uh because of that you cannot use"
2279040,2283520," the first capital letter but the rest of the things are you can use whatever you want right"
2285600,2295760," a b yeah so iab and iab is the same yeah and of course you can put this thing in in front of each"
2295760,2301920," of these things right so you can just do it like that uh right so and for different things you can have"
2301920,2308880," different capitalization if you want to right so and here uh you can even put things like that"
2309440,2316080," right there we go so here is your right ln and uh there we go which makes it super easy to search"
2316080,2322080," for each individual call of the function all right so you wanna you have a function you know what you"
2322080,2328160," want to know without using ide in how many places the function is used you you just can't grab it"
2328160,2336960," right you have to come up with the uh regular expressions with uh you know something like this uh between each"
2336960,2345920," individual letter uh so yeah that's basically uh what we have in here it's it's a cool it's a cool"
2345920,2353280," language i really like this so this is the right line there go so okay let's actually try to uh generate"
2353280,2363200," an image so we have a 64 by 64 uh image right 64 by 64. so each individual pixel is encoded with rgb and"
2363200,2369840," each individual channel is a single byte so we should be able to do something like write uh and as far as"
2369840,2378800," i know um i think you have to basically convert this thing to uh to a character to actually write it so"
2378800,2386240," the first component is going to be uh red the second one is uh g and b there we go so and let's try to"
2386240,2392880," run this entire thing and is it gonna work is it gonna work now yo and let's take a look this is"
2392880,2400640," a red square that we just generated with new in the ppm format right so and it's uh in emacs in in the"
2400640,2407600," raw form it looks like this so yeah the the beauty of this formal format is that it's stupidly easy it's"
2407600,2414400," stupidly simple you just put this header in here and you just dump your bytes uh into the file and there"
2414400,2420240," you go you have a ppm file uh and you can actually view it in the uh viewers that support this kind"
2420240,2425760," of stuff i think that supports that but unfortunately it kills my encoding because of the background and"
2425760,2429680," shit like that so we're not going to be using that we're going to be using emacs as the image viewer"
2429680,2436880," i can view that in emacs right so we can also make it a little bit bigger so let's actually make the"
2436880,2444880," size of this image 128 right so here's 128 i might as well actually open this image in a separate uh"
2444880,2450800," buffer right i'm opening it in a separate buffer and maybe i'm going to do auto revert mode so it"
2450800,2455840," automatically rewards this entire thing and if i do something like this i think uh yeah it automatically"
2455840,2463360," rewards every time i change something so let's actually make it 512 right there we go uh and it"
2463360,2470400," automatically rewards everything so maybe 512 is too much it's actually perfect i think so and we can"
2470400,2476640," try to modify the color uh for instance maybe i'm gonna make it a little bit more dim uh and a boom there"
2476640,2485120," we go so it's a little bit more dim so let's try to write a shaders uh right so let's try to write shaders"
2485120,2496640," so essentially what shaders do they interpolate your um x and y coordinates from zero to one right so uh"
2496640,2504320," how can we do that so you as far as i know just corresponds to uh x right and what we need to do"
2504320,2513680," we need to uh divide x by width right by width and uh we need to take v and divide y by height but to"
2513680,2521360," to be able to do all of that we'll have to actually cast uh both x and y and width and height to float"
2521360,2528080," and i don't know how to do that in him so let's actually google that uh cast to float uh there we go"
2532000,2539440," so i didn't expect chr part why do we have to do that uh well it doesn't really expect string here"
2539440,2547760," is the thing uh it expects whatever it expects because the functions are overloaded um so you see"
2547760,2556480," it has shed ton of different where are all of these things uh i think i saw a lot of them so right it has a"
2556480,2561920," right int but i'm not sure if right int is the one we want to use you see it's it's a single right in"
2561920,2567280," here and it's overloaded for different types right it's like in c plus plus you can overload functions"
2567280,2573680," uh but i'm not sure if it writes a single byte in here maybe it does let's actually try to uh to get"
2573680,2579840," rid of it and use int one i think it's a good point maybe maybe it's not needed in here so let's also"
2579840,2585520," comment it out and let's try to run this entire thing uh and let's take a look at the output uh"
2585520,2596880," and i think it worked more or less let's actually try to set the uh 255 and see if it actually will work"
2598560,2606320," so this is going to be output ppm and no it doesn't work so you cannot use just integer in here i think"
2606320,2613120," oh yeah it it actually printed it as an integer you know uh in asking right because we want to print"
2613120,2615760," the a single byte that's why we want to do that"
2615760,2621920," uh all right so let's try to do that one more time"
2622960,2631520," okay there we go here's the thing we wanted okay so how do you cast to float in nim cast"
2631520,2638560," types um type custom casing casting i don't know how to pronounce that i'm sorry"
2638560,2645760," uh okay so it's a type conversion so you just wrap it in a particular type so maybe that's precisely what"
2645760,2651200," we want to have in here so i'm going to do float there we go and i'm going to just wrap it like that"
2651760,2657840," boom so another one is going to be float and here is the float there we go and now we have uv"
2657840,2667280," shigiman subscribed for seven months hi uh hi hello how are you doing thank you so much for seven months"
2667280,2672640," of uh tier one subscription thank you thank you thank you and welcome to our epic anime club how about that"
2676400,2682240," all right all right so now we have u and v interpolated right so we have u in the interpolated"
2682240,2689920," and they're basically values from zero to one we can create um a function called frag right so this"
2689920,2696400," is going to be frag uh which accepts uv coordinates i think you can actually pass um you know arguments"
2696400,2703600," like this if i'm not mistaken you can basically group them together if they have the same type just like in uh in pascal"
2703600,2711680," and here we want to return the color of that one pixel that we generated right so how can we return i"
2711680,2717360," think we need to have um a custom type but maybe we can use tuples right because name has a tuples"
2717360,2724400," if i remember correctly right so it's going to be tuples rupel's tuples uh okay"
2725200,2734080," uh so tuple uh so they're named tuples i think you can just straight up return something like this"
2734080,2740880," right so uh do they have to be named uh anonymous field syntax okay this is actually perfect i can"
2740880,2749040," probably return float float float float uh but to be fair i'd like to have names in front of them i think"
2749040,2757920," that would be kind of cool where i could say that this is red this is green and this is blue and this"
2757920,2762080," is going to be a normalized color meaning that each individual component is from zero to one you know"
2762080,2770080," the usual stuff in opengl right so this is going to be tuple and uh there we go so and how do i construct"
2770080,2779280," such tuple uh i think uh we can give it a try can i construct it like this right so let's try to"
2779280,2787360," compile this thing uh a boom it in fact compiled but not used okay so because we never actually passed"
2787360,2794000," this into anything so this is a simple shader right this is a simple fragment shader that we can use"
2794720,2800320," so after that what i'm going to be doing i'm going to be calling uh this fragment shader on these uv"
2800320,2808000," coordinates that we just created right and i wonder if i can now just take rgb right and destructurize"
2808000,2812960," it like this i think i should be able to let's actually try to compile it i think and see but"
2812960,2818240," yeah i can do that so this is actually super convenient all right and after that we want to convert"
2818240,2824400," each individual float to the byte right since it's a value from zero to one we want to multiply it by"
2824400,2833520," 255 and then convert it to um it depends what chr actually accepts it depends on what it actually"
2833520,2844080," accepts let me see let me see so chr show me your wisdom uh it's a range oh this one is interesting"
2844080,2854080," this reminds me of ada wait that's cool it doesn't accept any particular value it accepts"
2854080,2862560," a range from zero to 255 it's like almost like ada right and maybe you can define these integer types"
2862560,2867120," that are ranges and depending on the architecture it's going to be just like represented differently"
2867120,2872640," uh this is actually pretty cool but i think i'm going to just do integer hoping that this is going"
2872640,2881200," to work right and uh i'll have to do that for each individual component actually so g and this one"
2881200,2894400," rgb um it combines successful uh concept from mature languages like python ad in module yeah you know"
2896080,2900480," this is a very successful concept this is a very successful concept this is the most successful"
2900480,2905200," concept i've ever seen in my entire life this is so i can feel the success"
2905200,2917520," all right so feel the success uh all right seems to be working and uh did it work did it work um i think i"
2917520,2923120," think it didn't work okay there we go so we have a shader so this is a classical uv pattern by the way"
2923120,2928240," uh we generated this by the way without opengl"
2930080,2938400," again people you don't need gpu and opengl to generate a single frame that looks like this"
2938400,2946000," you just don't right the only reason why you need opengl is that you want to generate"
2946000,2952080," seven thousands of them per second or maybe more maybe like ten thousands of them per second we don't"
2952080,2967440," need to generate one uh once in the blue moon um let me go so and essentially the way you do that you"
2967440,2975680," just take x and y coordinates you transform them into zero to one right zero to one and then you have a"
2975680,2981920," symbol a single function that maps these uv coordinates to rgb and then you save those rgb to"
2982080,2993360," to the file um all right so let me let me see let me see let me see um now what we can do in"
2993360,3000080," here i don't know we can probably put some sign in here uh and again since we have a universal call"
3000080,3005040," syntax i can actually do something like this right i can actually call sign like this this one could be"
3005040,3010240," cosine um and it's not going to work probably because i have to import math or something right"
3010240,3018160," you see sign is not available unfortunately so let me make a wild guess that i have to import math"
3018160,3025120," uh and it was correct apparently so let's revert the entire thing and there we go so here we have this"
3025120,3032560," shit uh interestingly maybe we can make it repeat a little bit faster uh again i can actually put it in"
3032560,3040720," here and maybe multiply it like by 10 right right multiply all that shite by 10 and let's see what's"
3040720,3051520," going to happen uh output out revert mode and boom uh yep yep something oh and how did the exception value"
3052000,3060400," uh is bigger oh yeah yeah yeah yeah you know what's going on you know what's going on uh this entire"
3060400,3068640," shite is from minus one to one but these things have to be from uh zero to one so you have to do the"
3068640,3076960," classical thing of actually you know adding one and then dividing all that shit by two right"
3078960,3090320," and maybe you can multiply it by half like this uh and then go here and there we go we've got this kind"
3090320,3100160," of pattern uh so uh change the disk area okay so uh emacs is actually kind of kind of going crazy on me"
3100160,3107920," right now i don't know why but it is what it is we can probably save this like parameter uh n to here right"
3107920,3114560," something like this uh it's kind of like that and then i can try to recompile the entire thing uh why"
3114560,3120000," does it ask me changing disk really edit the buffer i don't really edit anything why do you ask me to edit"
3120000,3127440," it uh i'm really i really don't like that it asks me uh so maybe it would be better if we had"
3127440,3136800," other program that could live reload images maybe something like that right so is that capable of doing that"
3136800,3144000," poison girls does anyone know uh so first of all the problem with fair that i don't like i really don't"
3144000,3150480," like it it has this like you know checker pattern background that ruins the entire encoding you can"
3150480,3156640," actually see that so do you see the pixelated zozin do you see the pixelated zozin this this is me this"
3156640,3163360," is a pixelated zozin thank you very cool right so this is a huge problem especially if you are a streamer like"
3163360,3172880," myself so you have to put some sort of like a background color right so uh yeah so you can put"
3172880,3179840," b style as a background i think you can do something like fair that how do you pronounce that by the way"
3179840,3186480," ph ph ph ph um so i think you have to put minus b and you say something like black"
3186480,3190160," and there we go you have a black background i think it's actually pretty cool all right"
3191040,3202960," uh so now can i uh reload um if flag is dot that will reload the current image instead of switching to"
3202960,3210960," the next one uh all right okay specify a shell command as an action to perform on the image"
3211520,3221040," in a slideshow or motor the action will be run when action action zero key is pressed uh okay uh auto"
3221040,3235040," rotate uh reload reload uh uh first current image after uh useful for viewing http webcams frequently if"
3235040,3243920," images remove that will okay we can use that um but it's an integer right uh is there any is there"
3243920,3251600," any way to reload and changes so there is a this sort of thing uh so you can trigger that automatically"
3251600,3257920," uh you can trigger that automatically after do you have i mean i would have find it if it was"
3257920,3264800," existed because i'm literally searching incrementally searching by reload if it had auto reload i would"
3264800,3272400," probably found it already so uh this is the there is a reload after each second but i didn't see any"
3272400,3283280," reload on modifications so what i see is basically reloading each second or um reloading on requests right so"
3283280,3289920," by pricing r or something like that so we can try different uh different things in here so first of"
3289920,3295600," all i'm gonna actually uh grab this entire thing and maybe run it in here there we go so then i can"
3295600,3305200," probably uh split my screen uh like so uh can i actually make it smaller right so because i want to be"
3305200,3314800," able to see this uh and now if i have some stuff in here right for instance i want to uh maybe modify"
3314800,3320320," this thing like that so now we're gonna have something like this all right and uh where is my"
3320320,3328080," compilation modus uh this is not what i want i want you to uh rerun my thingy and now i press r so i can"
3328080,3334880," actually reload everything automatically so um you know what's cool is that this thing is very"
3334880,3340880," resolution independent right it can scale up and down as much as you want if i want to make it smaller"
3340880,3349200," uh i can make it smaller uh compilation there we go uh there we go and now it is in fact smaller let me go"
3349200,3357040," so it's 64 by 64 now because we are not calculating pixels by their absolute values they're calculating uh the"
3357040,3363440," course of the pixels by uh interpolated values from zero to one so we don't care and uh furthermore"
3363440,3370320," it is even a ratio independent i can make the uh you know the width bigger than the height and still"
3370320,3376160," will work because the shader function the shader function here doesn't know anything about resolution"
3376160,3384560," it just has uv from zero to one it literally doesn't care uh right there we go boom so it just squashes it"
3386320,3391840," and all of that without any shaders like completely in cpu see if you have a very simple case if you"
3391840,3396720," have a very simple case and you don't generate too much of the you can just do that in cpu you"
3396720,3404400," don't have to do that on gpu come on um so yeah isn't that paug is that paug fell case i think it's pretty"
3404400,3414880," how um why is the uh args called u and v by the way i think for the same reason why coordinates are called"
3414880,3426400," x and y uh why no idea it's a convention uh all right so when i reload thing by the way does it it also"
3426400,3437440," actually brings it back uh yeah all right so uh i actually want to change the resolution in half right"
3437440,3445040," we're changing the resolution in half and uh let it go so this is one way to do that right so we can uh"
3445040,3454560," manually request the um reloading which might not be super convenient right another solution would be uh right"
3455680,3464560," to put something like was it r and reload every second right which makes it blink"
3464560,3470480," do you see the blinking when it reloads every second i'm not sure if you can see that but"
3470480,3480080," it freaking blinks for me every time it reloads uh so i can see the blink holy like it it can't even"
3480080,3486960," reload it seamlessly without messing oh my god this is so bad well i can see that uh that's the problem"
3486960,3496320," it says you had a such a simple job of displaying an image and auto reloading the image and you can't"
3496320,3505840," even do that it's just like oh my god so i i didn't even know what to say to the third boys and girls i"
3505840,3511520," don't even know what to say it's such a simple thing to do maybe i have to write my own image viewer just"
3511520,3519840," to be able to do this kind of stuff i don't know uh these days uh these days i don't know"
3519840,3526800," you know uh it would be nice to have this kind of thing on this bar um but unfortunately we don't really"
3526800,3533040," have that much space in here right so if i'm gonna put it in here this is how much chat we're going to"
3533040,3540960," have so i'm not sure if i'm gonna do that so but at the same time so this is too much space in here this"
3540960,3551520," is too much space yeah maybe it's fine i don't know we'll see uh so all right so we have something like this"
3551520,3555360," and uh yeah for the other things we can do something like"
3555360,3571360," u plus v multiplied by n uh multiplied by n and then plus one and multiply by half right and uh there"
3571360,3576880," we go right so and then i can reload this entire thing and now it has additional strips in here which"
3576880,3582880," is actually kind of cool i think this this kind of additional strips are really cool i didn't expect"
3582880,3593920," that huh so if we make it even bigger like right uh-huh so these strips become visible uh but at the"
3593920,3602080," same time if you make it like this um yeah it becomes something like this all right so we have fragment"
3602080,3606640," shaders right so that's basically what we have in here we have simple fragment shaders"
3606640,3612960," you can change the resolution you can make them bigger if you want to uh right so now they're way"
3612960,3622720," bigger they have more stuff in them uh and so the next thing we want to do we want to generate the"
3622720,3629440," corners all right we want to generate the corners uh but i think we're going to do that after a small"
3629440,3643760," break because i really want to make another cup of tea"
3643760,3657600," the letter u and v denote the axis of 2d texture because xyz are already used to denote the axis of 3d"
3657600,3664000," objects in model space while w and the addition to xyz is used in calculating quaternion rotations"
3664000,3671440," yeah i was right for the same reason why we use xyz nobody knows right it's just the convention for"
3671440,3678320," the same reason why we use i as an iterator variable uh so yeah it's just like basically the you know"
3678880,3686480," convention no nothing nothing nothing particularly special why what kind of tea the special kind of tea"
3686480,3695840," uh because the next blue and one don't look horizontal interesting by the way do you guys"
3695840,3701360," want me to upload this thing to to github right now so you can play with this it's actually"
3702320,3707120," this is a single file that's what makes it makes it cool right so we're generating some"
3707120,3714880," interesting uh with a single file and this will work in any language by the way so you can easily"
3714880,3721040," rewrite it in any language you want and it's going to be the same thing uh right so let's actually create"
3721040,3736080," uh read me like reading md uh okay wang so gradients gradients with wang tiles in nim right and we can"
3736080,3739120," actually point to the new programming language"
3739120,3751120," the pull request to rewrite the entire thing in rust unfortunately these days i don't really look at my"
3751120,3758000," notifications on github anymore because i have too many of them and i just couldn't be bothered so i'm sorry"
3760000,3767040," uh so yeah i'm really really sorry i feel like an asshole but it is what it is it's just like too many"
3767040,3774880," things that are not even that important so i just like just don't bother if you have something super"
3774880,3784480," important to bring to my attention try to ping me on other platforms uh so yeah i'm really sorry about"
3784480,3791200," that it's just like too much for me and like lately my mental health is actually pretty pretty low all"
3791200,3799680," time low right if you know what i'm talking about all time low you have this feeling in my body um so"
3799680,3803920," and that's just like couldn't be bothered by notifications i'm really really apologize for that"
3803920,3812240," uh so yeah the thing we want to do here is going to be uh nim right and that's basically what we have"
3812240,3819680," in here and then you do and output ppm so this is basically a quick start uh quick start"
3819680,3825520," and uh the license is obviously going to be mit you can do whatever the you want with it"
3825520,3831520," and we're going to get ignore the entire thing so this is going to be main this is going to be output ppm"
3832160,3844800," and also maybe we're going to say that you have to install install new compiler uh first right so https"
3844800,3854960," right https and there we go and here's the entire instruction nothing particularly special so gitmit and"
3858160,3862720," why are you asking why why are you asking okay i don't know why it was asking me uh this kind of stuff"
3862720,3873840," so and uh yeah ready set a go and um how should we call this entire thing so i already called my"
3873840,3883120," folder wank tiles so maybe i'm gonna actually call the repo like that as well uh wing tiles wing tiles"
3883760,3890800," there we go um so i'm not gonna put any description yet because i don't really know what exactly we're"
3890800,3897440," doing we're just experimenting with these things and uh all right um"
3900080,3908160," add origin and i'm gonna push this thing in here and yes yes yes yes yes why freaking dessa"
3908160,3919120," want tiles oh okay so we'll have to rename it let's see through how many loopholes we have to go to"
3919120,3927040," actually uh rename this thing right so we have to rename it oh we didn't even ask my password i'm actually"
3927040,3935600," surprised uh all right so you can find the uh the repo in here so it's a single name file nothing"
3935600,3943280," particularly special uh it's actually pretty readable and it's not complex at all right so it's just like"
3943280,3948320," it's almost like python would you look at that it's almost like python it even has like a style of python"
3948320,3953760," like in python you also have if underscore underscore main underscore underscore equal something something"
3953760,3959360," something then run it otherwise don't run it or something um yeah and especially like defer"
3959360,3962240," i think more languages these days should have defer"
3962240,3972720," um all right so and uh now uh i'm gonna actually put this entire thing in the description as well for"
3972720,3977520," lovely people on youtube who's watching on youtube by the way if you want to be a lovely person on youtube"
3977520,3981920," who's watching me on youtube who's watching me on youtube you need to subscribe to this channel right"
3981920,3986560," and if you're watching on youtube and you want to watch me live go to https"
3986560,3995440," right so why do i have a c plus plus in here go to https twitch.tv slash sodding and follow me there"
3995440,3997840," right so you see you can be whoever you want to be"
3997840,4002880," right you want to be a twitch person go to twitch you want to be a youtube person go to youtube"
4003600,4009440," the possibilities are unlimited my god my god"
4009440,4014320," anyways uh so yeah we also need to update the um"
4014320,4026720," um the um the project command so here's the source code and where is the project command so project uh"
4026720,4035840," generating gradient with wang tiles all right so i'm gonna update cmd project and uh we're gonna say"
4035840,4044560," source code and uh we're gonna put this thing here um so also i'm gonna put this thing like this for"
4045840,4055280," one sender and let's put this thing like that did it work okay so it seems to be working it seems to be"
4055280,4063360," twerking there we go um cool so now what we need to generate we need to generate this idea i was talking"
4063360,4069760," about at the beginning of the stream where uh yeah we have different gradients right and we're just like"
4069760,4074240," putting them on different sides and also we need to think how we're going to be merging the colors in"
4074240,4080240," here uh so i don't think i want to merge them too much because otherwise the tile is not going to fit"
4080240,4086640," properly on the corners so maybe this is going to be like a hard line between these things but we'll see"
4086640,4093920," we'll see and by the way another interesting thing is that uh generating circles with this kind of style of um"
4095920,4101840," of shaders is actually super easy oh and by the way you can have actually several shaders in here so here"
4101840,4109120," we have um i don't know stripes right so here is the stripes shaders a shader and i just use stripes"
4109120,4116480," right and then uh i can create another shader so you see i can have several functions that represent"
4116480,4122560," these fragment shaders and i can swap them out and that will work so another one is going to be a circle"
4122560,4128240," right you accept uv coordinates like this and you return a color so i wonder if you can just do"
4128240,4136480," something like uh type um rgb right so and then i can say that i'm returning rgb in here uh and i'm"
4136480,4143040," returning rgb in here i think i should be able to do this kind of stuff so and uh in here we need to find"
4143040,4150560," the distance uh between the distance uh between the center and the center by the way is located at uh"
4150560,4165200," center x is located at half uh and half half and half uh so what do we do we do cx minus u probably um"
4167200,4174000," oh yeah we're basically subtracting this entire thing so and the second one is going to be c y minus"
4174000,4179360," u it would be nice to have a vector library you know what i'm talking about right because the cool"
4179360,4190640," thing about glsl for instance is that you have all this vec2 vec3 vec4 vec69 matrix 4x4 matrix 420 by 69"
4190640,4195040," and all of them have these all very cool operations and they're very very convenient"
4195040,4200640," uh so we need something like that we need something like that and i think we can implement that pretty"
4200640,4207840," easily at least i can implement vec2 right so i could probably try to and to be fair vec2 is essentially"
4207840,4221520," just a tuple right x uh float um y float and then as far as i know nim has operator overloading uh yeah"
4221520,4232240," you can actually overload operators in nim just like an c plus plus so operator hater uh okay so where is the"
4232240,4240480," operator this is not what i wanted mr nim uh operator overloading"
4240480,4247760," overload resolution operator overloading and negative failures i just need an example please"
4253120,4261200," oh yeah this is how we do that i think right so you say uh something like proc all right you put the"
4261200,4269520," backticks and then you say plus and then you accept two things in here a and b which are vec2 and then"
4269520,4276240," you return back to and that already overloads this entire thing as far as i know so i think you just can"
4276240,4285440," construct a uh x plus bx a y plus uh by and there we go so when you can have different operations in here"
4285440,4292000," right query place plus with minus uh is it really minus minus looks kind of sus yeah it's it's actually"
4292000,4299120," minus then creepless minus with uh this thing and then you can do something like to replace this with that"
4299120,4308720," thing and we already have like a you know uh um linear algebra thingy so it wasn't that far i'm not sure if"
4308720,4316080," this intention should compile by the way so we'll have to also test how it compiles but uh yeah so and"
4316080,4326160," another interesting thing algebra yeah as far as i know you can also have generics in here right and"
4326160,4330560," maybe with generics you can parameterize how many of these things you can have in here but i'm not sure"
4330560,4335840," so let me see if this entire stuff compiles i'm going to comment out this thing and uh what we're"
4335840,4343440," going to have yeah yeah this works yeah you can basically overload this kind of things um"
4348560,4357040," uh gradients with vang tiles um rings uh like a nice idea to create a pearl noise a fake without"
4357040,4366000," actual math uh nice uh that's uh that's requires exquisite emote yeah exquisite there we go yeah"
4366000,4372320," you you need you need a glass of wine while re you read this message yes exquisite indeed yes yes"
4372960,4384160," gradients with blank tiles yes very nice yes uh so um yeah so we have this kind of thing and what i"
4384160,4392800," wanted to do i wanted to actually generate a circle um right uh so let's go ahead so this gives me that"
4392800,4403280," but on top of that i think uh i'm gonna have dx dx and then i'm gonna have uh dy uh and i suppose we can"
4403280,4413920," have something like if the dx dy plus d uh no dx dx because it's a square right uh dy is"
4416080,4427280," oh less than uh what i suppose zero five right um so it depends on the radius right so less or"
4427280,4434960," equal than the square of the radius and in this case the radius is going to be uh let's say 25 right"
4434960,4441520," if it is we're going to be returning i think a red color right so this one is going to be just"
4441520,4449680," red there we go so here is red otherwise we can return black right so let's see if this"
4449680,4455600," entire thing will compile let's see if this entire thing will compile and yeah so it seems to be compiling"
4455600,4465600," can we use that thing now uh here all right can we use it here and uh where is my thingy majingi output"
4466160,4474560," and that worked as you can see that's that's a pretty cool circle that's a it's a very cool circle"
4474560,4483920," um please uh okay so let's try to understand what the hell is going on"
4483920,4491920," um so you have a center and you have oh okay i already found the bug okay let's go"
4492800,4501120," um all righty all righty and boom there we go we generate a circle so that's how we can generate"
4501120,4507440," easy so we're generating it pixel by pixel so for essentially for each individual pixel we are"
4507440,4513440," checking is it within the circle or is it not within the circle right we can make it a japan flag if"
4513440,4519040," you if you guys want sure it's just like means that i have to uh make this color white"
4520960,4530800," easy um all right so and cool so this is a japan flag oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah"
4530800,4537840," japan flag generator exactly"
4542080,4546880," but but the japan is supposed to be like wider and shirts um so"
4546880,4557120," so if you make this entire thing wider right if you make it wider um it's gonna look like"
4557120,4570960," by the way just saying uh boom all right so you need to be sort of like aware of um you know resolution and"
4570960,4579600," sure stretch to you yeah yeah uh but to be fair i don't know how easy to do that so let me actually"
4579600,4587280," quickly replace circle with japan right so this is the japan shader this is a japan shader uh"
4587280,4597520," and this is freaking this motherly but i wonder if you can actually make it branchless if you know what i'm"
4597520,4602160," what i'm talking about uh can you make it branchless if you save this entire thing to"
4602160,4610080," a separate variable right right you save it to a separate variable and then uh what we return is"
4610080,4617040," right we want to convert it to c actually to float right uh if it's true"
4619040,4627760," um interestingly we always want to put one in here right it's just basically uh if it's true"
4629840,4639360," uh we can try to invert it all right so that means it's going to be in uh float c float c there we go"
4639360,4642720," so and this entire i think becomes branchless"
4642720,4651520," oh yes it does look at that it's branchless right it doesn't have any if conditions or anything like that"
4651520,4658160," so we're using directly the value of this condition is that does that make it branchless i think it does"
4658160,4665680," kind of um yeah so is that what branchless programming means um so"
4665680,4672800," you can actually use different colors now right so if you're not happy with the red one"
4673360,4679200," uh right so you can basically probably use the green one um"
4679200,4683280," optimization on yes uh"
4683280,4690080," there we go so now it's a green one so that's actually a pretty cool idea i think"
4690080,4695520," no never thought about it so the thing we want to probably do in here is also um"
4697280,4706240," you know be aware of proportions if you know what i'm talking about um a little bit just a little bit"
4706240,4711280," just a little bit um branchless code means that no dependency tree"
4711280,4720720," cool uh so we know their entire resolution because it's global right uh it is global"
4722640,4729520," uh now uh what we can do we can probably take the aspect ratio of this thing right as"
4729520,4740400," which is um i guess height over width right but to do this kind of you have to do float"
4740400,4746240," all right float and there we go we have an aspect ratio is it gonna help us somehow"
4746240,4752080," no idea probably probably not um so one things we can probably do"
4752640,4757840," is maybe multiply aspect like this but i like every time i work with aspect it actually blows"
4757840,4762400," my mind so i don't think it's gonna be it's gonna be like a useful thing yeah it's actually"
4762400,4768000," it up okay so i'm not gonna do that then and uh what i wanted to do by the way uh what i wanted"
4768000,4774000," to do i wanted to make a small break boys and girls i was about to go on the break and i went on a huge"
4774000,4776400," tangent um so yeah"
4776400,4789200," all right so aspect is declared and uh yes yes yes so for some reason i don't have a build"
4789200,4795360," neural like neuron path in my brain to work with aspects something like that i don't know why but yeah"
4796240,4806960," so uh let me actually also commit whatever we have in here um you know what we could do the following"
4806960,4817440," thing i can accept the um uv as vector i think that would be actually kind of cool so um"
4819360,4833440," uv x right so this is a uv x then uh uv x uv y uv y n there we go so accept vector and then rgb and here"
4833440,4842800," we accept uh vector so and because of that we can have a center uh right center which is effectively half"
4842800,4849600," of this thing right of this thing right and then we have d which is basically center minus uv so we"
4849600,4857280," compressed these two things and for the uh vector we can also define something like length right so it's"
4857280,4868720," going to be length uh which is essentially all right so this is a vector uh vector two and um right"
4868720,4878720," so this is going to be x x plus uh y uh y and we can take sq or t of this entire thing i suppose it has"
4878720,4888000," to be flawed yeah length has to be flawed unfortunately all right so and after that i can say um yeah the"
4888000,4896160," cool thing again uh since we have a universal call syntax i don't have to do length d i can say d"
4896880,4903280," length yeah i can just do that and i think even the parentheses are optional right so and then i can"
4903280,4909280," just do something like this uh so this is that this is that and uh is it going to compile is it going"
4909280,4917200," to compile probably not yeah it didn't compile so 28 predefined c uh oh yeah because this is a center now"
4917200,4924160," and uh how should i call this thing so this is a center this is the difference and this is i could call"
4924160,4930320," it others are results so it's actually called a i don't know like i'm running out of uh of letters to"
4930320,4937360," to work properly unfortunately okay so what do we have a type mismatch got flawed float okay so the line"
4937360,4942640," 40 uh oh yeah so now what you have to do you have to actually call it like that there we go"
4942640,4951520," all right so you have to be able to construct um a vector out of the center i think and is it working is it"
4951520,4958160," working it is in fact working it is in fact working so we have a simple library that works with vectors"
4958160,4962880," look at that so you only have to define a tuple and overload a bunch of operators in here"
4962880,4969680," so that's pretty pogg uh another interesting thing is that um"
4969680,4978000," we only use d in a single place right we only use d in a single place we can actually in line d"
4978720,4987520," uh like this right so there we go we just in line it and that's fine i guess uh right so that's fine"
4987520,4996240," um and another thing r r is actually i mean again it's also used only once so you can basically keep"
4996240,5004240," compressing this entire uh expression more and more uh and it would be nice to be able to come uh construct a"
5004240,5010640," vector from a scalar um if you know what i'm talking about so maybe we can we're gonna have something"
5010640,5019360," like proc uh vec2 which accepts a single scalar and returns vec2 but the fact of what it does it just"
5019360,5026000," you know duplicates this entire thing right and that way we can say that the center is vec205 but in fact"
5026000,5033440," it just you know duplicates it into into a vector and then we're subtracting the uv and this is how we"
5033440,5038560," get the length and this entire expression is way simpler and way easier to read by the way in my"
5038560,5045920," opinion right look at that i think it's beautiful uh yep it's actually way easier to read i think yes"
5045920,5053840," so and this entire thing produces the japan flag right the right obstructions at the right time make all the"
5053840,5064400," the difference mr freeman so uh it's pretty cool it's pretty cool so i only wish that nim was not a toy"
5064400,5071120," okay i wish two things i wish it was not another toy language and second thing i wish it didn't have"
5071120,5080800," this so uh yeah and the reason why i say it's a toy language it's literally pre-processor over c compiler"
5082880,5088960," uh so this doesn't help me to take it seriously i just can't take this language seriously i'm sorry"
5088960,5096560," uh anyway so but it has a lot of cool ideas uh so and it's also pre-processor over cpp and it's also"
5096560,5104000," pre-processor over javascript you can actually compile this entire shit to javascript uh i'm pretty sure it's"
5104000,5111200," not gonna work so the way you compile to javascript you put js in here right and okay it actually compiled to"
5111200,5114320," okay so we we just generated javascript out of work"
5114320,5124800," uh so okay so we have a javascript oh i think i know what the it is i think i can now"
5124800,5131920," run this thing with node can i can i run this thing with node for slower performance"
5134560,5141280," okay i can't do that unfortunately f open oh okay so it generated javascript right it generated javascript"
5141280,5147520," but it cannot find such thing as f open okay thank you very much we could have implemented that i suppose"
5152640,5158720," uh okay uh okay so this is the new all right so and this is i think generated as the japan flag"
5158720,5167040," uh did it have you tried using d yes you won't believe how many languages i tried"
5167040,5171600," you won't believe how many of them tried uh"
5175920,5183360," you can do much with the toy language trust me i know a lot about using programming uh toy programming"
5183360,5189680," languages in production the entire world uses javascript in production and it's a toy scripting"
5189680,5196240," language designed for verifying html forms that doesn't change the fact that it's a toy programming"
5196240,5204720," language so um i wanted to make a small break um so let's make it uh i think"
5204720,5211680," so maybe i'm gonna also put the display lines so it doesn't confuse the people"
5211680,5220720," uh all right so all right let's make a small break and you guys uh have fun i suppose i'm gonna"
5220720,5229040," make a cup of earl gray all right so i have my tea uh and let's continue so the thing we want to"
5229040,5235600," generate in here is not really a japan flag even though we could uh generate a japan flag uh we want"
5235600,5242400," to generate like gradients and shit uh so maybe i'm gonna have a thing called wang and we're gonna accept"
5242400,5248400," uv coordinates and we're gonna return rgb uh right so that's what we're gonna have in here"
5250720,5259840," um rgb so what we're gonna start with i think i'm gonna start with just four circles right so um"
5259840,5265040," right we're gonna have a circle on each individual side in here"
5265040,5275760," uh and uh that way we're gonna generate a single wang tile and we'll see how it uh goes in fact so the"
5275760,5283600," first um thing let's find the position of this point right so the position of this point luckily by"
5283600,5288480," the way we're not following uh the open gl uh coordinates so our uv coordinates are actually like"
5288480,5297680," this right so because we're using like screen coordinates and whatnot uh so this point is located"
5297680,5306480," somewhere at somewhere at so by x it's half but by y it's zero so here is the thing that we have in here"
5306480,5314480," so then we can uh take that thing and subtract uv take the length right we're taking the length"
5314480,5323520," and uh the radius i suppose uh right is going to be used uh for all the four circles is going to be"
5323520,5332080," um greater than uh 25 and that way we can basically use this thing like so"
5332080,5341920," it's kind of similar to whatever we have in japan so which is kind of pogue but in case of this thing i"
5341920,5347520," think i'm gonna use the black color for now right i'm gonna use the black color and uh let's see what"
5347520,5356240," we're gonna have in here uh if i so maybe i want to actually run uh this thing like that so we can"
5356240,5362960," constantly reload into oh my god okay i almost screwed up everything uh what i wanted to do in here i want"
5362960,5380160," to just you know put it like that uh okay uh okay so identifier v 32 uh huh so this suppose this"
5380160,5386320," is supposed to be c and let's see what we have in here so here is that and this is what we've got"
5386320,5394320," which is rather strange right first of all i would like to have probably a bigger radius so the radius"
5394320,5403360," probably have to be um uh maybe half so it takes the entire thing right so it takes the entire thing"
5404160,5414400," uh right uh right so did it did it do the trick uh oh okay so um i should actually use the radius in here"
5414400,5425120," all right there we go uh okay so here is that um interestingly interestingly i would like it to be a"
5425120,5432240," little bit more squashed but i guess it's fine for now right it could be fine for now though it actually"
5432240,5438240," goes straight up into the center so we have if we have four uh circles in here and we'll make them"
5438240,5444400," properly intersect and whatnot maybe it's gonna even look good but when they intersect the question is"
5444400,5452080," how we're gonna do that so yeah it's gonna be a really interesting question anyway so um if i put"
5452080,5459120," one in here is it gonna oh yeah that's basically what gives the color uh so and if i want to use like"
5459120,5466560," black color in here i think i have to invert this condition um so let me see yeah there we go so that's"
5466560,5470640," kind of what we uh what we wanted um"
5470640,5478960," a mugs yes this is kind of sus not gonna lie this is truly truly sus"
5479920,5486640," uh um all right so this is the first one right this is the first thing"
5486640,5498560," so what's gonna be the easiest way to add the second one"
5500000,5514000," um so maybe we're gonna have a sequence of these um points right sequence of these points"
5514000,5520880," uh new sequence right i remember that new had some sort of a sequence and whatnot and i would like to"
5520880,5526400," have some sort of examples uh to see how you're supposed to work with this kind of stuff so we can have"
5526400,5536000," this kind of thing um but maybe that's not what i want right um so this is how i can define sequences"
5536000,5545920," right so uh if i put cs in here this one is going to be at and here is the first sort of center right so"
5545920,5550480," here is the first center and can i do something like this is going to work"
5550480,5555440," it seems to be working okay cool"
5555440,5564640," so uh the second point that i would like to have is going to be so it's on x is also half but on y"
5564640,5572160," it's going to be around here so this is the second point um so what we can do in here maybe we can map those"
5572160,5579920," things okay so i remember uh you could map them yeah you can actually map this entire that's pretty"
5579920,5587120," pogue right so we have a sequence you can map it into a sequence of uh colors and maybe you can then"
5587120,5594560," collapse those colors into something right um you can essentially collapse them but before we collapse"
5594560,5600960," like i want to know how you can make the uh black background right if you know what i'm talking"
5600960,5606400," about i think the easiest way to make a black background so if it's within right it's going to"
5606400,5614800," be like that but uh if it's something like this it's going to be something like this right uh right"
5615440,5620240," right right right right right right there we go then now now we're talking now we're freaking talking"
5620240,5625520," okay so and um essentially"
5625520,5636880," so this is only for one thing uh i can do cs and then we are effectively mapping the center i think"
5636880,5644000," with a procedure so the procedure is going to accept the center right and this is how we do that so"
5644000,5650800," this is going to be just like this uh i'm not sure if i um yeah i can just do equals right so it's going"
5650800,5665920," to be c and um in here uh uh i can just grab this thing and put it inside of the float"
5667200,5676000," uh like so right and that gives me a sequence of uh of the colors right so is it gonna is it gonna"
5676000,5685440," compile hopefully uh call and declare the routine map so map is probably located in sec utils so let's"
5685440,5687680," actually import this entire thing there we go"
5690320,5697840," red sun yeah typeless parameters or absolute oh so you have to provide the type of this thing okay so"
5697840,5711200," let's actually do vec2 um all right vec2 and uh so expression is of type float float 64 and has to be of type"
5712000,5722560," or has to be or has to be discarded uh yes yes yes yes yes so uh-huh so this is colors right so this"
5722560,5728800," is centers and these are the pixels okay so let's actually call ps and then we need to grab this into"
5728800,5736800," i think uh all right all right so it didn't work um"
5736800,5746960," that's really strange oh this is because okay i see right you you have to specify input and return"
5746960,5752800," type and if you don't specify the type it thinks that you yeah you just discard this thing i think uh it"
5752800,5759360," will depend i think it is working now and it doesn't break okay that's perfect that is in fact"
5759360,5764240," very much perfect and i wonder if i can just put this thing like that uh right so for a little bit"
5764240,5771920," of a convenience but i'm sure it probably doesn't matter um okay so now what i want to do i want to"
5771920,5778960," actually so i have a sequence of centers of the circles right so i have two uh two centers one here and"
5778960,5784960," one here i map through this entire thing generating a sequence of colors so now i want to compress the"
5784960,5794240," scores together uh thank you so much i'm a robot for 23 months of tier three subscription thank you"
5794240,5800240," thank you thank you that's that's a pretty generous subscription and yeah hello hello thank you so much"
5800240,5804880," um welcome welcome welcome welcome"
5804880,5814640," all righty so i need to now compress this entire so can we have something like reduce um or fold"
5814640,5817440," it's called fold okay so it's called l"
5817440,5829200," and to be fair to be fair uh all of this map and folds are pretty cool when you are young and like you know"
5829200,5834480," cs grad student or something like that but over time you realize that all of that is actually"
5834480,5840720," easier with for loops believe it or not it is in fact uh all of that easier with for loops"
5840720,5847200," and because in for loop you can map and fold simultaneously if you know what i'm talking about"
5847200,5856320," right so you can have the final result uh somewhere here i i do realize it is actually kind of cool when"
5856320,5860400," when you're new to programming and you discover this like new paradigm like holy"
5860400,5867760," fucking shit map filter reduces that's so cool it's so scalable you can parallel that but in in reality"
5867760,5874640," it's just in for loops you can you can do that way easier right because you can compress a lot of these"
5874640,5878480," operations into a single for loops and it's just basically the same shit"
5878480,5892800," and i do understand that a lot of people will disagree with me because they didn't go through this"
5892800,5900480," phase of functional programmers but it is what it is you'll have to you know deal with that my friends uh so"
5901520,5906560," we can actually use fold specifically here uh sequence and"
5906560,5911680," it's not the face"
5911680,5922480," yeah sure sure uh i'm thinking how i'm gonna combine them so do i want to do something like max"
5927200,5931760," yeah yeah yeah haskell another advanced languages have the ability to fuse the separation i heard"
5931760,5937360," that so many times it's the same over and over again yeah yeah sure uh okay let's actually do the"
5937360,5947360," real work in here um so what do we have um um so what can be the easier thing to do uh all right"
5947360,5957040," so i'm gonna just return always maybe a red right um it's the same for like 30 years"
5957040,5963120," okay so"
5963120,5976160," can i just do four c in cs right and for this entire thing uh i essentially uh just generate that"
5977360,5982960," uh and that gives me the color uh and that gives me the color right that gives me the color"
5982960,5992880," uh huh and where i'm gonna put that color so it's gonna be t and yeah"
6000560,6008240," okay okay and uh so this is gonna be the center right so this is the center and maybe here we're"
6008240,6014960," gonna be uh we're gonna even have uh also corresponding center and it's color you know"
6014960,6021200," what i'm talking about center and it's color uh so and then with these kind of colors we'll be able to"
6021200,6032400," actually um actually like pick the color we want um okay so uh and i want to be able to work with rgb like"
6032400,6039680," with vector and being able to uh do operations in it and whatnot so what i'm thinking is that we can"
6039680,6050720," probably introduce like the second vector type right uh zero x seven four six uh c six two uh"
6050720,6055600," studying poke thank you thank you so much for uh two months of twitch prime subscription thank you"
6055600,6063280," thank you thank you i really really appreciate that uh what does your nickname mean let's actually find out"
6063840,6079840," so we have effectively uh is does it say pog or something uh wait a second um to x so hex uh"
6079840,6087280," 70 ah uh t"
6087280,6092720," uh i wish well okay so this is t"
6093840,6110240," um and then uh six c tl62 blt so it's either tlb or blt so"
6110240,6117280," so i don't know what precisely it means but maybe we can actually try to convert it to"
6117280,6123360," uh decimal and decimal it also doesn't really make much sense okay so it's probably something special for you"
6123840,6132880," um all right all right i couldn't decode that you want this one uh yes it sounds like it's a bacon"
6132880,6138800," lettuce tomato yeah yeah so it's basically your name is a sandwich congratulations we decoded that your name"
6138800,6144960," uh god cryptography um"
6144960,6147840," uh god cryptography um"
6147840,6151120," all right so uh"
6151120,6153360," let's continue"
6153360,6160240," uh so essentially what i want to have in here i want to have the second type uh which is"
6161520,6168480," uh yep a sandwich was it true did we did we crack it we did we actually crack it i think we did uh i don't know maybe"
6168480,6172560," all right"
6172560,6183200," so this is gonna be vec3 and uh i want to have a similar purchase i wonder if i can generalize that even more"
6183840,6190480," uh so new generic uh values can you have values but i'm not sure if it's a"
6190480,6197200," that good of an idea so let's actually google for generics because i i want to have like a vector"
6197200,6202480," um yeah i don't think it's gonna work for tuples unfortunately"
6205040,6211920," uh oh if you make a tuple an array it may work"
6211920,6215760," if we make a tuple an array it may work"
6215760,6222400," so uh let me see where is the array stuff"
6222400,6227200," so where is the array so here is the arrays"
6227200,6232320," right and you accept a wrench in here and we can actually put"
6232960,6236560," i think yeah so essentially we can probably have"
6236560,6239760," uh a vector right"
6239760,6243520," vec which is effectively an array"
6243520,6245680," right and"
6245680,6254720," i wish there was an easy way to um"
6254720,6262000," have generics generics so the problem with neem is that it doesn't have that many good examples"
6262000,6264560," it's just like really really sad uh"
6264560,6268480," generics examples"
6268480,6274000," right and it's just like google is incapable of finding anything it's just so bad"
6274000,6281440," okay generics uh okay so we can have that uh but this is just a type and the thing i want to have"
6281440,6290320," is just a value right so templates you can have templates okay and maybe some other things and some other stuff"
6291120,6297600," uh part three and generics uh generics generics generics"
6297600,6304320," um to to do two i remember there was a pretty cool example you know"
6304320,6314800," uh that showed how to implement a matrix in nim and i think it was using the generic values right new generics"
6315600,6318160," metrics or something like that i think we even looked at it"
6318160,6321760," uh uh uh so"
6321760,6333040," array length tuple fields uh uh uh linear algebra okay maybe we can actually take a look at some linear algebra thing in here"
6334160,6341760," so here is the linear algebra lean algorithm and okay so there's some private types i think we need"
6341760,6348800," to take a look at the private types so and this is a wrong folder this is a wrong folder uh go back"
6348800,6353040," please go back so it's a lean alg private uh"
6353040,6360160," types okay so maybe we're gonna have something in the types static int that i do remember something like it"
6360160,6367520," yes i told you freaking told you that i do remember something like this yeah so that's how we do that"
6368320,6372240," so uh that's cool so we're gonna use this kind of okay"
6372240,6380080," um so when they also do that as an array okay that's nice so and the thing i wanted to do here so"
6380080,6389040," it's gonna be um n uh static int right and in here it's basically uh n i guess less than n i hope it's"
6389040,6395280," gonna work uh but uh unfortunately it has to be flowed and i wonder if i can use use size in here is there"
6395280,6406160," something like use size um name use size um name use size you int um probably not so we can we can"
6406160,6416800," actually use int uh you int there is you int though um i need to find the len function i have too many"
6416800,6425040," things opened unfortunately so i need to close some of this stuff uh to to to there's too many too many"
6425040,6432240," things so this is going to be len right this is going to be len uh and len always returns"
6432240,6443360," int so they use int as the size type throughout the whole language uh okay so um that means we're"
6443360,6454800," gonna we're gonna be using intent here all right and now uh so the problem with array approach"
6454800,6461920," right is that there is no particularly convenient way to access x and y right so if you have a vector"
6461920,6470160," like uv uh vec uh let's say two right you will have to access this thing as zero and one uh so maybe we"
6470160,6479360," could define some sort of a constants x zero uh y one to access this entire stuff oh this is actually even"
6479360,6488240," cooler idea i think because we can similarly defined also uh r g and b uh and i wonder if i can define"
6488240,6495200," several constants at once i think there was a way to do that um okay if i remember correctly i think there"
6495200,6501200," was like a way like almost like in pascal you know what i'm talking about yeah i think that this is a thing"
6501200,6512480," is it not i think it is right so and then our uh yeah i think it is a thing and uh at least the emacs"
6512480,6517520," mode does not complain about this stuff so i can probably use that so and every time you have a uv"
6518320,6526800," uh you can access it as x and furthermore we can have an aliases for uv stuff uh right so uv is zero uh"
6526800,6536000," v is one i think the third coordinate uh the third coordinate is usually s in uh in the textures i think"
6536000,6547520," right so uv is uv is uv mapping is it not is it not i don't uh i don't remember does anyone remember"
6547520,6558720," what's the third one usually uh what's the third one uh texture uh 3d texture coordinates uh to to to"
6558720,6569760," what's this uh i think it's i don't think it's w i think it was s uh okay so let me see opengl 3d texture"
6569760,6576960," so 3d texture"
6576960,6588640," i hate source code as an archive i really really hate that because it doesn't allow me to"
6588640,6592960," quickly look at this stuff so image 3d"
6592960,6604000," oh okay instead of in case of a texture is str or something okay so i think i'm not gonna do into that"
6604000,6609840," so there's also i think uv is not really texture stuff it's a normalized coordinates and texture"
6609840,6614320," coordinates is a completely different thing okay so we're gonna have aliases only for these things"
6614320,6618560," uh so i think it's gonna be fine so i want to first check if this"
6618560,6625120," this const thing is working right so we need to check that uh okay so vector redefinition of"
6625120,6630160," vector oh this is because i copy pasted this entire thing okay so let's remove the entire thing"
6630160,6638400," okay that works so that means i can combine this kind of like that that's perfect so i can probably"
6638400,6643600," also do this kind of stuff right uh all right so let's actually make the vector a little bit more"
6643600,6648480," generic so we can have like three dimensionals uh two dimensional three dimensional four dimensional"
6648480,6657360," uh and uh let's do something like this so we're gonna have a proc vec uh which is gonna be n static and"
6657360,6660800," uh we're already gonna get a pretty complicated i already don't like that"
6662000,6670640," uh all right so uh all right so and the result of this thing has to be vec n uh and yeah this is"
6670640,6680560," actually pretty cool so uh nim also automatically generates um a result variable for you"
6680560,6691600," which means we can do something like i in zero n right and result i equal s so that's how we can do that"
6691600,6699680," right so i wish it was didn't have a static i think static syntactically makes it kind of difficult to read"
6699680,6707120," i wish it was something like just this um you know what i'm talking about because like this static thing"
6707120,6712640," kind of makes it noisy look at this thing like it would be way better if it was just that and way more"
6712640,6722240," readable in my opinion right um so yeah i do understand why static is needed but it just makes it way noisier"
6722240,6730240," than it needs to be but again it's just a syntactical thing it's like a bike shading but yikes um okay so"
6730240,6738320," what do we have in here um so we suppose uh here we're going to be accepting uh two of these vectors"
6738320,6750800," right so here's that one and um yeah i think i'm going to actually remove this thing uh vec and static int"
6751840,6763520," uh it accepts n uh and returns vector n uh vector n and here is going to be i in zero"
6763520,6777120," i wonder if i can iterate the result thing directly i wonder um okay name for each uh array"
6781440,6792480," uh i wish there was like a little bit better uh for okay for statement uh for statement"
6792480,6805920," so we have an index and have an actual value but i also want to be able to uh refer to iterate this entire"
6805920,6814800," i think by reference right ideally i would like to have something like this where i have a component"
6814800,6823360," and then i just iterate the result and i also set each individual component to the value so i want to"
6823360,6825440," be able to do something like that if you know what i'm talking about"
6827760,6834560," uh i want to be able to do something like that um"
6834560,6840320," so that would be nice that would be actually super nice"
6840320,6847280," so rdb of course has to be vector three um right so it's a vector three"
6849840,6856640," uh that's um uh okay so let me see i'm gonna try to just compile this thing and see if it will break"
6856640,6866000," in that specific place uh for n okay so that's really strange um cannot generate code for"
6866000,6872960," this is the most cryptic error message i've ever seen okay so what can we just do something like this"
6872960,6880480," uh i want to comment out everything in here and we're going to have just a main thing uh right that"
6880480,6888720," doesn't do anything like discard right it discards everything uh all right cannot generate 25 all right"
6893760,6904480," so it's probably not how it works where is that thingy uh that we used i probably using the syntax incorrectly"
6904480,6910400," new uh linear uh algebra yeah there we go i think that's what this"
6910400,6918800," so let's take a look at this thing and uh private"
6920720,6930720," types there were types in here uh well it should work right but it doesn't just says that you cannot"
6930720,6936880," generate this kind of stuff it is what it is and it isn't so maybe you have to no arrays doesn't have"
6936880,6947760," to be separated like that and uh and if i comment it out right is it gonna work it is working so if i"
6947760,6954400," i try to do it like that it's just maybe this is because i have to do it like this minus one don't"
6954400,6965280," tell me that i have to do it like that seriously really you can do this kind of stuff in for loops"
6965280,6969920," to indicate that you won't don't want to integrate the last one but you can't do the same in arrays"
6969920,6978800," because for whatever reason really really i'm so disappointed holy freaking this is so bad this is"
6978800,6985440," why i don't take this language seriously like can you be consistent at least like holy fuck oh my god"
6985440,6993840," seriously it's just like i can't take it seriously it's it's a toy language it's a pretty cool toy"
6993840,7001680," language not gonna lie uh right but it's just like holy shit uh it's like it couldn't it couldn't work"
7001680,7009920," right yeah it cannot generate the code you see um it couldn't generate the code"
7011360,7024800," um all right so uh it's a i'm telling you it's a toy language literally uh so here's the thing uh can"
7024800,7030000," we like i really want to be able to do it like that so i'm iterating each individual component of"
7030000,7037680," the result by a reference and i set it to the value um i want to be able to do it like that i wonder if it"
7037680,7042640," will work let's see it's probably won't work but okay so it does work okay that's actually pretty cool"
7042640,7053920," uh can i now test if it's going to work uh right so essentially uh eco vec um 69 just 69 and i'm gonna"
7053920,7062720," say okay vector2 is it gonna be able to print me this thing uh okay so template generic uh instantiation"
7062720,7071680," here here cannot be assigned to okay oh oh okay because it was never instantiated since it was never"
7071680,7080800," instantiated uh it will it never worked essentially all right so let me see um"
7084000,7091920," so for loop so for loop i need basically all of the possible examples of for loop uh all of the"
7091920,7098160," possible examples of for loop so for statement so you can count it like that it doesn't have"
7098160,7104720," enough example it's an interesting language but it doesn't have enough examples um right so you can"
7104720,7111040," integrate it like that so this is the index this is the item scope and i suppose that is it right"
7111040,7122240," for loop by reference and i'm pretty it always redirects to this useless tutorial right oh my god"
7122240,7128240," it's just like always like that okay yeah yeah yeah somebody gets it gets it somebody gets it i want"
7128240,7137040," to do it like that how do you do that uh okay um but it seems like um expression element for loop cannot be"
7137040,7144960," assigned to the original uh should be read only it should be readable uh okay uh okay this is a field"
7144960,7146800," um"
7146800,7152960," okay so i'm thinking i'm wasting too much time on this stuff so we're going to be doing something like n"
7152960,7159600," uh less than n and then uh the result is essentially going to be i so there we go i'm not going to even"
7159600,7166640," bother to spend too much time on this kind of stuff uh all right so the template and declared identifier i"
7166640,7173680," so this is going to be i uh all right okay there we go so it actually generated so and if i want a"
7173680,7179520," vector of like three it's also going to work for that as well hopefully yeah there we go seems to be working"
7179520,7188640," so now we have vectors and uh so here uh we're going to have plus and the plus is effectively like this"
7188640,7199200," right so result i is equal a i plus bi there we go so the cool part now is that we can simply copy paste"
7199200,7212720," this entire process for pluses uh minuses uh multiplication and uh division right so there"
7212720,7219680," we go so we're going to have these things and then i can say that rgb is this stuff and uh interestingly"
7219680,7224800," okay so let's actually try to compile stripes i didn't think it's going to work really well but we can"
7224800,7231280," try so type vec2 is basically vector all right so we have a bunch of aliases for this kind of stuff"
7231280,7240560," uh right so let's see let's see so uh 44 uh yeah we don't have this kind of stuff anymore so let me"
7240560,7249040," do this kind of thing right boom boom boom that's precisely why i wanted to do that and by the way uh"
7249040,7256400," since we have sort of aliases for this thing i can say u uh right and this one can be b uv coordinates"
7256400,7263840," so i can refer however i want with them uh all right type mismatch uh 44 um okay and of course this"
7263840,7268400," entire thing has to be an array if i understand correctly right so it has to be an array is it going"
7268400,7276800," to work and it worked in fact so uh we compiled this striped thing so this is rgb right so this is rgb so this"
7276800,7285360," is a vec uh i probably have to do something like vec i wonder if it will infer the type in this specific"
7285360,7290720," case i wonder if it will and we also want to have a length uh right so let's actually implement length"
7290720,7301200," so length is going to accept the static in here right so then a vector n uh and will return a float right"
7301200,7311280," so and in here essentially what we're doing we're iterating uh less than n right and the result is"
7311280,7322320," effectively plus uh a i a i all right and then it's going to be equal to the square root of this entire"
7322320,7330320," thing the square root there we go so that way i can just quickly take the length and okay so that's cool"
7331200,7335360," uh all right all right let's see if it compiles"
7335360,7343760," so 53 53 it doesn't like that what does it say uh cannot instantiate n"
7343760,7350400," uh-huh so that means it needs to know precisely the type of this thing can i say two"
7351280,7358640," and i can okay so i would expect this entire thing to actually infer the generic it would be kind of"
7358640,7367760," cool right so it knows the n from uv it could infer that it also has to be two but it couldn't because"
7367760,7373440," well yeah it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't uh is it not i think it is anyway"
7373440,7381920," um cool so now what else do we have in here so uh we're going to compile it like that so this is going"
7381920,7391440," to be rgb uh so this is a uv uh and that should be it if i understand correctly right so let's see"
7391440,7400560," is it gonna work uh okay 74 74 uh wang because we don't have wang files so let's actually put japan in"
7400560,7411680," here right so this is going to japan okay 74 so are you telling me are you telling me that you cannot"
7411680,7422000," destructurize a race is that what you're trying to tell me my friend uh i can't destructurize a race"
7422560,7441920," or do i have to do that in a very specific way so this is a pixel right so we have to do pixel this"
7441920,7447360," all right and then pixel like that and this is going to be something like this"
7447360,7465200," we finally make it compile all right so uh finally we have generic vectors it was hard"
7465200,7471600," the language didn't help uh but we managed to have like generic practice and whatnot"
7472160,7479600," so and the thing i want to be able to do i want to be able to have like a max uh function in here"
7479600,7492000," right so n static int and it takes a and b uh vector n and basically finds the maximum like component wise"
7492000,7499280," right so it finds the maximum component wise between this entire things so i in uh zero less than n"
7499920,7510000," uh result i so can i just put maximum a i uh b i so hopefully that will work we'll see how it goes"
7510000,7519840," um yep yep and there we go so but we never actually instantiated that generic thing so maybe it doesn't"
7519840,7529520," really matter so just to actually demonstrate look what's going to happen if we replace i think we need to"
7529520,7534400," query uh query uh query replace with the regular expressions and i'm going to be replacing these"
7534400,7543040," things specifically with just int uh didn't really work that well i think i have to do it like this uh static"
7543040,7552720," i think it became much more readable at least if i separate this thing like that okay so maybe i"
7552720,7555280," if i could uh do this kind of stuff"
7555280,7566320," like it's like a single static make it makes it so noisy for no apparent reason whatsoever and it's just"
7566320,7574640," like pieces me off why did you have to make it so noisy like oh my god i don't know i don't know boys and"
7574640,7584320," girls uh okay so clear replace uh i think this is what we have to do yeah there we go so let's go back"
7584320,7588320," and instantly it's just like too noisy could have been way simpler in my opinion"
7597520,7603520," so how's it going everyone do you guys enjoy nim so far is that a cool language interesting java"
7603520,7609600," programmer says about noisiness in function declaration to be fair java is not that noisy because it's just a"
7609600,7620160," sequence of um a sequence of words of english words right so uh it doesn't have like you know a lot of"
7620160,7628080," special characters or anything like that um i would say the noisiness of java it's as noisy as ada for"
7628080,7634800," instance and it's like words um but here we have like a special characters and stuff like that"
7634800,7646240," um yeah it's just what the um have you ever used pascal any thoughts about it i never used pascal what is it"
7646240,7648640," um"
7648640,7653760," never heard of it"
7653760,7664640," okay so um we've got that"
7664640,7673360," surgeon have you seen i never heard of it what is it what is c uh i only know nim i only know nim"
7674560,7679120," um all right so what i wanted to do in here so we have a maximum in here and stuff like that"
7679120,7686400," so here we have a bunch of centers right we have a bunch of centers here is the color and the final"
7686400,7692480," thing is going to be basically oh in here i can yeah we have a result variable so that means i can do just"
7692480,7703120," a result uh right um result uh equal maximum between the result and t and i think that will just work"
7703120,7711840," fine uh all right so what do we got what we got and it didn't compile okay cool type mismatch got this"
7711840,7720080," thing but expected oh uh-huh float 64. so it's happened in 72."
7721440,7744240," uh i don't quite understand so we have a c oh yeah because this is supposed to be an array sure this is"
7744240,7753040," supposed to be an array cool we have a sequence of these things cool almost we're almost there uh so"
7753040,7762320," we have a maximum got rgb between uh i see yeah i see that i see that"
7762320,7770640," cool so uh can i actually put this thing like in line now"
7771920,7779760," uh zhi yang subscribed a tier 2 holy for 25 months holy thank you thank you so much for"
7779760,7788160," more than two years of tier 2 subscription holy uh thank you thank you thank you and welcome to our epic"
7788160,7793680," uh nim clap i don't know how long you've been watching but uh we have a japan flag in here"
7794560,7802000," so let me let me actually see so uh yeah there we go we generated a japan flag but on cpu"
7802000,7809280," without using any uh third party dependencies or anything like pixel by pixel right we're trying to"
7809280,7818000," sort of like emulate uh fragment shaders right so essentially we're iterating from zero to height and"
7818000,7823600," from zero to width we're interpolating this entire thing and we're passing the interpolated things into"
7823600,7830640," a pure function uh which uh basically calculates this entire thing so we're trying to do the uh sort of"
7830640,7838240," like a fragment style stuff so i still haven't changed my bulb by the way you can see how dark it is in my"
7838240,7845280," room right now it is literally dark so yeah we're just features of new media i really like that so"
7845280,7851440," i really like like i really like to observe how it confuses people in the chat like people ask what"
7851440,7857200," the is right so to make it even more confusing oh i can't do it like that so i can"
7857200,7864720," i can probably do it like that and even like that so so let's make it even more confusing"
7867200,7875440," uh yep yep yep yep yep so we can even put it like that um so"
7875440,7884560," maybe i can yeah perfect so and that will work actually that will actually work"
7884560,7885760," uh"
7890400,7898000," it's not very smart of a language to do so it's supposed to be case they're not even case"
7898000,7904480," insensitive style insensitive that's what it's supposed to be it's a style insensitive language you"
7904480,7911840," can use a snack case you can use camel case you see the possibilities are limited it's such a useful"
7911840,7919200," language it's beautiful it allows you to do whatever you want it's style insensitive beautiful beautiful idea"
7919200,7925440," i absolutely love it anyway but not pascal case by the way yeah you cannot do pascal case because the"
7925440,7931040," the first character means that it's a type so you can't you can't use that that will not compile well"
7931040,7937200," it's style insensitive unless you're trying to do a pascal style in case that in that case it you can"
7937200,7948400," do that uh sorry sorry sorry i will never understand it so to be fair i personally keep thinking about"
7948400,7955040," this feature over and over again for several years already and i just can't justify it for myself like"
7955040,7962880," i just just cannot do that and i'm constantly being critical of myself always and i just cannot justify it"
7962880,7969120," like i don't see the point of this thing uh except pretty words like you can program in any style"
7969120,7974560," you want but in reality like nobody cares really it's just like a really weird thing i don't know"
7974560,7983600," maybe you'll never understand that i'm a really smart person unfortunately anyways anyways uh so we're"
7983600,7988400," trying to generate wang tiles all right i hope i pronounced their name correctly though"
7988400,8000160," wang tiles uh so yeah so we need to put wang in here all right so this is going to wang why i keep"
8000160,8006720," typing want my my fingers actually have like a memory to type want instead of wang for some reason i don't know"
8006720,8015280," why um all right so there we go uh uh so that seems to be working and okay"
8015280,8023520," generated something we generated something which is cool i suppose so we have two circles now"
8026000,8034320," uh wang tiles well yeah but wang is as far as i know it's like a actual name of the person who um you"
8034320,8043120," know proposed them um so on top of that i also want to keep track of the colors right so here we can"
8043120,8052800," essentially have uh so this is the center right so this is the center and here we can have a color so the"
8052800,8062320," first color is red uh right so and the second thing in here uh this one let's say that it's going to be"
8062320,8075920," green right uh like this can i now uh apparently i cannot but we can probably uh have something like sides"
8076960,8092720," uh and can i now put it like that um okay so this one is going to be a center um maybe position and the"
8092720,8103040," color in sides right uh and then so we take the position right so that gives us this thing"
8104640,8112560," all right and we want to multiply this thing by a color but the color is a vector three-dimensional"
8112560,8120400," vector so that means we need to construct a vector out of the uh out of the scalar in here and that will"
8120400,8128160," give us the new color right so okay that looks cool so this is the basically the fragment shader"
8128160,8135920," uh let's see if it's gonna work uh it does not work because it expects some okay oh okay that makes"
8135920,8141680," sense maybe that's why it couldn't align everything no this is not why yeah emacs isn't capable of"
8141680,8149520," actually properly aligning this thing in here for some reason i don't know uh 73 yeah sure"
8152400,8162960," and you create identifier side uh s i forgot s i'm sorry you never forget s okay that's cool so if i"
8162960,8169120," try to run this entire thing there we go so we have two circles of a different color right uh that's"
8169120,8179280," pretty pal not gonna lie so uh let's add another circle uh on the side right so uh somewhere at the"
8179280,8185200," right uh the right uh the right position in terms of x i think it's one right and i think it's one and"
8185200,8193120," in terms of y it's half right and let's also make it blue and let's see how it's gonna look like right we"
8193120,8201040," always like try to take the maximum component wise so that means in the place where these things intersect"
8201040,8209200," we're gonna see a really weird um let's say color blending i think i think this is what we're gonna"
8209200,8220720," see uh so let's go uh and it didn't compile okay so i wonder why uh because i'm a dummy okay that that"
8220720,8226560," explains everything uh all right a boom and that is actually pretty cool"
8226560,8230960," it's smic no"
8230960,8241200," it's actually no it's it's actually oh oh yeah it's a proper blending isn't it this is how they blend"
8241200,8247920," are they when you combine red and blue you you have magenta yeah so then now they're blending properly"
8247920,8254400," so the thing we're trying to generate in here by the way we're trying to generate wank tiles um for two"
8254400,8261680," colors but we have more colors in here but uh then we're gonna change the generator to have two colors in"
8261680,8273680," there um yeah okay so uh let's actually add the second one right uh let's add the second one so"
8273680,8280640," the the fourth one i mean i'm sorry uh so the left one in terms of x is going to be zero in terms of y"
8280640,8285840," it's going to be that and uh we're going to put a yellow in there right so this is going to be the yellow"
8285840,8294560," and now we have four sides in here uh kind of confused why it blends because the way we blend"
8294560,8307680," colors is that uh look uh we just find each pixel for each circle right and uh if we have two pixels"
8307680,8315200," right so here's the rgb of one uh rgb one rgb let's actually use the course in this case"
8315840,8321360," uh and this is another rgb uh and this is another rgb so the final color when you mix those things in"
8321360,8329200," is going to be uh maximum um i don't know how to show that maximum"
8329200,8332560," between"
8332560,8345680," that color right and that color right and all of that component wise r g b"
8346720,8348560," right so that's how we combine them"
8348560,8360240," so all right uh let's go did you recompile all that uh maybe maybe it did maybe not"
8360240,8369200," uh all right and that was actually kind of weird why didn't blend it uh properly but yeah"
8370400,8379360," okay so i suppose it turned out to be like a maximum for all of them yeah that's really funny"
8379360,8386640," so yes yes yes yes could we freaking this"
8386640,8396960," so when they overlap maybe we can just add them together i'm not sure what's gonna be adding them"
8396960,8406320," together how adding them together will help so we can try to also reduce the size of the radius"
8406320,8411040," um all right so the radius right now is a half we're gonna do something like this"
8411040,8420320," i also i'm also a little bit tired as you can see yeah okay this one is interesting that's already could be"
8420320,8426400," used as a wank tiles if you if you ask me so that's already pretty cool um"
8426400,8437280," okay and we can turn them into gradients at some point oh that's that was weird uh okay 25 uh let's"
8437280,8451200," actually make 13. okay something like that um so after that after that we can probably um"
8451200,8459520," uh wtf what are you talking about uh is there something unclear uh or what i understand"
8460560,8467520," it's just like they started to you know overflow or something uh i think i i want them to barely"
8467520,8474560," touch each other you know um i want them to barely touch each other so they don't"
8474560,8479520," yeah something like that i think this is actually more or less good um yeah"
8481520,8488400," it would be it would be also kind of cool oh you know have you guys heard about meta balls you have"
8488400,8496400," you guys heard about metals uh metal balls i never actually tried them but i want to try them"
8496400,8505600," yeah these shits we could actually make them blend with each other like meta balls or something that"
8505600,8510800," will be actually sick that will be really really sick mate"
8510800,8520560," it's like a ball sack yeah yeah i see that by the way so i think i need to put that in the description"
8520560,8526640," um so where is my description description meta balls"
8529920,8537520," and of course for people who's brave enough to watch those in life uh i'm gonna put this thing in the chat"
8537520,8546480," i'm already super tired holy fuck holy fucking tired so i think i'm not gonna go crazy on uh this thing"
8546480,8550480," i think i'm not gonna go super crazy on this thing"
8550480,8554240," and i'm going to simply"
8556720,8564800," add the gradient right but having metables would be even cooler uh i think having metables would be way"
8564800,8572960," cooler so what we're doing here is essentially we check if this thing is greater or less than radius"
8572960,8581280," but we can use that closeness to the radius as a way to interpolate and make them fade away"
8581280,8586400," you know what i'm talking about you know you know you know right so that means we can just"
8586400,8593680," grab this length divide it by the radius and i suppose we also want to clamp it"
8593680,8602080," uh because the bigger it is the closer it's going to be to one so that means we'll have to take a"
8602080,8607760," minimum between that and one but we also want to invert this entire thing so we'll have to"
8608960,8617920," sort of uh do one minus this entire thing so that gives us that and i think this is what i want to call"
8617920,8627120," t so then uh i'm gonna take this t turn it into a vector multiply by the expected color and put it in"
8627120,8636000," here so that's what i want to try to do so i think that will create some sort of a gradient in there i think"
8636960,8647040," let's see let's see and uh a boom that was easy uh so yeah uh what if we will make them actually"
8647040,8657440," intersect uh so if it's going to be like a half uh right uh okay okay and boom that is already freaking"
8657440,8667440," interesting this is the hydrogen atom so that's what it is yes it's a hydrogen atom uh have you seen this"
8667440,8669760," uh that's actually pretty cool"
8669760,8679440," uh or something it's it's like sort of like a like a you know atom orbitals source electron orbitals or"
8679440,8689520," something like that uh electron or that's what it looks like at least uh is there something atomic orbitals"
8689520,8691520," uh"
8691520,8696240," yeah something like this i was thinking about this kind of stuff"
8696240,8706320," so that's what it is uh all right is it in excited state i don't know maybe it is"
8706320,8713120," uh we can make it maybe even bigger so let's actually say 60 so they intersect even more hopefully"
8713120,8719360," uh right right right and at some point it doesn't really make any sense anymore i think"
8719360,8726240," right at some point it's just like all blurred together uh the cool thing by the way boys and girls"
8726240,8731920," is that we're doing all of that on cpu right so without any shaders like you if you want to just play with"
8731920,8737280," ideas for particular patterns right so you have an idea on a particular pattern that you want to"
8737280,8743680," do you don't really need any jlsl you don't need to set up anything you can just like straight up try"
8743680,8748160," to do that on a uh on the cpu um"
8748160,8758400," and uh the only thing that is required to to do in here i think is essentially"
8759200,8764720," just iterate through each individual pixel interpolate the coordinates of the pixel to"
8764720,8770720," like through zero and one and pass them to your fragment shader function get the color and put the"
8770720,8777760," color in there and you can save that into the uh ppm format specifically p6 right so google up like"
8777760,8784000," ppm image p6 right i think this is the most like useful format in my opinion pp61"
8785120,8789440," ppm yes it's a very small m um all right"
8789440,8797840," cool um i think i want to actually change the way we blend things if you know what i'm talking about"
8797840,8804160," how can we blend things can we just multiply them together okay uh the thing i'm going to try we're"
8804160,8811920," going to just multiply it no no no no no no so the original thing is black right the original thing is"
8811920,8817600," black that means if we try to multiply these things together it's not really going to work well but"
8817600,8826880," what if we set this entire thing to uh white right so this is the white and now we're simply multiplying"
8826880,8832160," this entire stuff like that so is it going to produce a better and more interesting blending"
8832160,8839280," probably not so what the hell is going on okay i forgot the parenthesis uh so what the hell"
8839280,8846000," what the hell are you oh these operators are separate operators"
8846000,8858880," okay so we have to do that i suppose i don't want to do that but we'll have to do that okay i mean we can"
8858880,8861920," specifically do that operator if you know what i'm talking about"
8861920,8868640," well i mean it's like in c plus plus so what did you expect"
8868640,8879760," uh it's like in c plus plus uh proc uh so in here we'll have to accept this entire thing"
8880560,8888080," uh hello nail surges welcome how are you doing so and i suppose according to the error first thing has"
8888080,8898640," to be a variable right so x uh a var back n and this is going to be back n and does it return anything"
8898640,8904480," i think it doesn't return anything okay so we can just do that and i wonder if i can do simply a a"
8904480,8917520," multiply b uh i think i should be able to do this kind of stuff right uh"
8922320,8946560," so what i'm thinking is that um"
8948240,8954880," uh we can do plus but if we're gonna do plus we need to be able to"
8954880,8959920," uh clamp this if you know what i'm talking about"
8959920,8976640," is that sufficient enough hopefully anything for you free food of course uh okay so um we can actually try to"
8976640,8978720," clamp this thing um"
8978720,8989920," yeah we do max okay so we're gonna do plus right so this is plus and this is going to be a minimum rather"
8989920,8993520," between that and vec3"
8993520,9003440," uh vec3 one there we go so and that means i will have to implement the min so we already have max let's"
9003440,9009040," implement min and you know how we're gonna implement min well uh clearplace max boom easy"
9009040,9017680," so the most reusable code is the one that you can copy paste right it's not the one with a lot of"
9017680,9023840," generics and stuff like that is the it's the one that you can copy paste easy easy peasy lemon squeezy"
9025520,9035520," uh okay and that didn't work because they all over flew oh i know why because we set the color to be"
9035520,9038080," white so if i remove this thing it should work now"
9039680,9043280," um all right so that's a little bit better"
9043280,9052320," that is interesting though"
9054640,9062640," so what if we have more interesting course so this is a yellow this is that and then"
9062640,9072160," something uh like this uh this this this and yeah so let's take a look"
9073760,9085440," okay so we can now try to use that as the wank tiles probably i want to actually"
9085440,9089680," these things to somehow cover the corners but i'm not sure if it's going to work really well"
9089680,9095840," uh right so let me try to do the radius a little bit bigger"
9097920,9103040," you know what i think that my problem with this thing is that it starts to fade away"
9103040,9111920," right from the center right i want to have something like a rim right so"
9111920,9121520," you have the circle uh and within the circle and this is horrible you have the circle and within the circle"
9122320,9129120," yeah yeah like i draw that smoothly myself uh this is completely solid color right this is a completely"
9129120,9137120," solid color and it only starts to fade away like from here you know around here"
9137120,9151920," so that's what i want to have uh so that means oh i'm tired i'm super tired"
9153200,9159280," super super tired so maybe i'm not going to do that um one thing i can do now um"
9159280,9164400," i think i want to make a small break i think i want to make a small break"
9164400,9180960," so five minutes um yep yep so i want to make a cup of tea right and uh yep"
9182320,9190640," so uh let's continue so let's quickly get this to some sort of like more or less finished state"
9190640,9197520," for for this episode of the wank tiles i suppose i'm going to do a second one uh because we didn't"
9197520,9203600," even get into the actual engine that generates the grid of tiles right because that could be a"
9203600,9211440," uh an episode by itself right because you have to uh take the masks of nearby tiles and you will have"
9211440,9217760," to figure out the mask of all the allowed tiles that can go in there so it's it's an algorithm on its"
9217760,9224960," own that may require uh its own episodes so it's actually uh the task is bigger than i anticipated as"
9224960,9232720," usual programmers are really bad at estimating things in my opinion it's not the programmers"
9232720,9239600," bad at estimated things it's just the things the programmers work with are really bad at being"
9239600,9245600," estimated you know what i'm talking about so the nature of the problems we're solving they are not"
9245600,9253840," cannot be really estimated properly right so uh because quite often we don't even know what we need to do to"
9253840,9258800," solve the problems so we need to start solving the problem to at least understand the problem will be"
9258800,9265440," better and then we can estimate it to some degree uh right so the problem we're solving are not really"
9265440,9272320," great at being estimated it's not the programmers fault it's the uh it's the nature of the problems we're"
9272320,9278880," solving agile estimation doesn't mean they don't make any sense agile agile itself is a huge scam so i don't"
9278880,9287200," really buy it um right um all right"
9287200,9303120," okay so uh let me see let me see what i want to actually have in here is on top of accepting uv i also"
9303120,9311920," want to accept a mask uh that represents the uh the sides right so essentially um we need to decide how"
9311920,9318720," we're going to represent the the sides right so uh we have a quad we have a tile right one two three"
9320080,9321840," i'm scam scam scam scam master"
9321840,9331200," does your team have a scam master already or any scam meetings anyway uh so"
9331200,9334640," there we go"
9334640,9348080," uh this one is the top right so this is the top and we have we have bottom uh here we have left if i understand"
9348080,9353680," shit correctly right i can put left in here and here we have right there we go so here is our tile"
9353680,9361520," so we need to store the um thing in a particular order so let's actually store them"
9361520,9371680," oh blt right let's throw them clockwise clockwise clockwise starting from bottom bltr right so"
9372560,9382240," like a sandwich like a sandwich right uh like a sandwich bacon latest tomato uh r what could be r"
9382240,9391840," so what kind of sandwich is this what is our radish in the sandwich yikes ranch okay so ranch actually"
9391840,9396640," sounds good uh like a ram ranch gotcha hyper"
9396640,9399840," um"
9399840,9402960," okay"
9402960,9414880," so uh bltr so that's the sandwich we're gonna have in here cool um and yeah so basically uh bits"
9415840,9423680," in this specific mask represent the color so since we're doing wang tiles with two colors zero is gonna"
9423680,9430720," be let's say maybe yellow car and one is gonna be maybe i don't know magenta color right so and based"
9430720,9437840," on this mask uh based on this mask uh the wang thing should generate things accordingly right so maybe"
9437840,9442720," we're gonna actually accept it like this i really want to actually accept it as bltr i think it's a pretty"
9442720,9452400," good name for a variable right so uh and we're gonna have can we have you int eight uh new you int eight"
9452400,9463520," let me see is that a thing so there's a system module uh you int you int eight okay we do have you int eight"
9463520,9476320," would you look at that uh i clicked on it uh unsigned eight bits so let's take a look at the source"
9476320,9480240," okay"
9480240,9490320," it's a compiler magic i really like this directive oh by the way this is a very dangerous page"
9491440,9502480," uh you know why because it redirects you to github edit and edit automatically forks"
9502480,9513120," uh the repo under your name so if you try to click edit that will automatically clone like fork uh repo"
9513120,9519120," into your account so i remember clicking on this thing once and it's just like holy"
9519120,9527600," fucking shit it's started to do shit and like oh my god oh oh oh and yeah it's just like why why would"
9527600,9535040," you do it like that this is so first of all why github would implement this stupid edit feature that"
9535040,9542080," forks and stuff like that and second of all why would you integrate with that it's just like uh yeah"
9542720,9546080," so because i actually did it once so because i actually did it once and it was like holy"
9546080,9557760," fuck bruh why why why um okay so bltr so we accept bltr in here and this is all right"
9559200,9569840," uh so i suppose we'll have to store these side points somewhere right so um since it's a bltr"
9569840,9578240," it actually also depends on how we iterate through this entire thing uh if we're going to be iterating"
9578240,9584560," it starting from the right side it's the beat masks are way easier to iterate starting from the right right"
9584560,9593200," so we have something like this this is not a beat mask uh basically you can divide by two right if"
9593200,9600640," you have x right and you divide it by two uh you will basically shift everything but you can always"
9600640,9607120," just shift it like that right so uh that will give you give you this thing without this thing and at any"
9607120,9612880," point you can just do something like this and that will give you a beat from here right that way you"
9612880,9621120," have two operations basically uh take the top of the stack of the beats and pop it out right so and"
9621120,9627200," because uh all the top is the right one it is easier to iterate starting from the right so it would be way"
9627200,9640560," easier to keep the sides uh rtlb rtlb if you know what i'm talking about uh rtlb so uh this is gonna be"
9640560,9653360," sides and uh what we're gonna have so the right one uh rtlb rtlb so the right one in terms of uh can i do it"
9653360,9671680," like that uh rtlb uh so and in here the right one in terms of x it's one and in terms of y it's half okay"
9671680,9681120," cool the top one in terms of x is half but in terms of y it's zero makes sense left one in terms of x it is"
9681120,9690560," zero uh and in terms of y it is half i can see that bottom in terms of x it's half uh in terms of y it's"
9690560,9696640," one okay i think i didn't make any mistakes in here here are the sides that we need to iterate in here"
9696640,9703920," so the radius stays the same and i wonder if i can make uh this entire thing const"
9706000,9716160," um maybe not i don't know doesn't matter uh so uh and it also greatly depends uh"
9716160,9722960," yeah we also need to keep track of the color right so here is the sides and now we also have the colors"
9722960,9731360," and the color i think i'm gonna make it um some sort of an array so the first color at zero is going to be"
9731440,9739120," yellow right so we're going to keep it yellow uh so this one is zero and this one uh it's probably"
9739120,9744080," going to be magenta so this is not yellow by the way this is yellow magenta is something like this"
9744080,9748560," so this is going to be one so if your color is zero this is going to be your color if your color is one"
9748560,9754080," this is going to be your color all right so we have all these things that are necessary so after that"
9754080,9762640," we are starting to iterate the sides right so and that gives us the positions here are the positions"
9762640,9767520," uh so um"
9767520,9779360," uh here is the position so i calculate this thing uh and now i need to grab the color but the color is"
9779360,9789360," essentially uh the color is colors bltr and i want to do mod one but i'm not sure if it's i think"
9789360,9796720," this is how we do that i think it recognizes that you're doing uh that with uh numbers and it becomes"
9796720,9804880," like a bit operations or something like that so that way it kind of works then we are um combining all of"
9804880,9812240," that right so this is combining and then i can do bltr bltr shift uh we need to shift to the right right"
9812240,9822720," shift right one uh gnu pro i would kindly ask you to stop back sitting it really stresses me out"
9826320,9839600," uh so um because you've been doing that the whole stream i'm trying to like politely ignore you to"
9839600,9846160," sort of like let you know that uh you know like i don't really need your help but you don't seem to be"
9846160,9852160," understanding that so i'm telling you directly now please stop back sitting you're not helping thank you"
9852160,9865520," very much okay so uh this is how i was gonna go um okay all right so there we go um okay bltr cannot be"
9865520,9871920," assigned to all right this one is interesting so these things are constant right so these things are"
9871920,9881280," constant so maybe because of that uh i want to actually do something like war war mask bltr and that's what we're"
9881280,9891840," going to be doing in here uh could replace bltr mask uh okay uh all right so okay this is actually very"
9891840,9900000," interesting uh type mismatch got array zero one um so let me oh yeah okay so that makes sense one one six"
9900000,9910320," okay now uh we can try to put different masks in there and see how they will work i can put zero in here and"
9910320,9916000," that will color everything with the same color right so that's what it will do uh so let's see how it"
9916000,9929440," goes um okay and if i refresh this entire thing it didn't do anything surprisingly uh okay uh uh-huh uh let"
9929440,9933600," okay let me let me let me see that's really really sus is that because"
9933600,9945040," okay it still uses the same stuff and i don't really understand why uh because we're using sites wait wait"
9945040,9954000," wait um okay we're only supposed to have yellow and magenta right so that's the only thing we're supposed to"
9954000,9959360," have in here on the yellow and magenta but it looks like it completely ignored this thing"
9959360,9964400," um here's the colors here is that"
9970080,9976640," if i change it to japan uh right is it gonna do a different thing um"
9976640,9982000," oh okay oh yeah because japan doesn't accept this thing"
9982000,9995520," oh okay so it it doesn't actually re uh resave it or anything like that so if i remove this entire thing"
9996240,10001840," and oh it become okay it recompiles the okay i mean it's so it's supposed to be supposed to run this"
10001840,10009760," thing okay uh i can see it now there we go so here is the japan flank and uh right so this one is going"
10009760,10016000," going to be uh wang and i'm going to put zero in here right so here is the zero"
10016000,10025280," uh all right so we're going to do that and here is the basically the thing uh okay so if i have one"
10025280,10031040," so one of the sites will be uh of the magenta color and let's see how it's going to look like"
10031040,10037120," uh there we go so here's one of the sites if it's going to be two right so the other side is going to be"
10037120,10044000," uh of the magenta color uh there we go so this is this uh the other side and three three is actually"
10044000,10048800," two bits now right so it's gonna it's gonna mean that both of these sites are gonna be magenta color"
10048800,10057040," uh right so and you can basically go and generate all of the possible tiles for the um for the wank"
10057040,10068400," tile sets uh all 16 of them so let me actually try to do that um so something like uh"
10068400,10079920," safe wang uh tile right so here we're gonna be accepting um i suppose the bltr uh which is you"
10079920,10086960," int 8 t uh it's not t right it has to be this thing and uh here we have we're gonna have file path and"
10086960,10094000," it's gonna be a string right and i suppose i'm gonna be copying this entire thing in here and we're gonna"
10094000,10102800," be sending mask like this right and we're gonna be using file path uh like this there we go and let's try"
10102800,10112400," to generate the uh like the whole wang tile set and save it to the uh to the file system right so uh we're"
10112400,10124160," gonna be tier rating starting from um let's call bltr uh in zero uh less than 16 right um and i'm gonna do"
10124160,10131200," save uh and of course i define it as a snake case and i'm gonna do something like this save like this"
10131200,10138800," and it's gonna work right because you know new uh all right so this is gonna be fmt and then here we're"
10138800,10149920," gonna have a tile uh right uh bltr uh ppm right there we go and that should generate us the full wang tile"
10149920,10157360," set uh all right so maybe i can even save things like a file path in here uh here's the file path"
10157360,10167280," and then we can echo um generated generated file path like this and let's see what's going to happen in"
10167280,10174800," here uh there we go so let's run this entire thing and uh there's a problem in here so what's up with that"
10175520,10181360," uh expression expected but found key okay so this has to be like this uh are you gonna work now"
10181360,10191840," hopefully um all right so type mismatch int string uint uh builder is a type of int i wonder if you can"
10191840,10198240," have int uh literally in here so i think the easiest way to do it right now is going to be something like"
10198240,10203360," this right so it's probably there is a better way to do that but i don't care about it right now"
10203360,10207920," so here we go we're generating each tile so it actually takes some time to generate all of them"
10207920,10214560," okay so and that's why you probably want to use opengl right so you want to do that on gpu"
10214560,10224080," uh okay so here is the bunch of tiles and uh i think i want to actually generate them with the leading"
10224080,10231200," zero and i wonder how you can do that so uh let me see let me take a look at the string format"
10231200,10236960," and just see how you generate this thing um"
10236960,10244720," very nice yeah yeah so it's definitely an improvement over the c compilers of course uh"
10244720,10253280," so str format what's the format in here um leading uh so there should be some sort of padding okay formatting"
10253280,10262880," strings okay you can yeah you can pad uh and i suppose you can also pad the numbers with zero"
10262880,10270160," yeah you can put zero three okay that's perfect actually so um i can put something like"
10270160,10279200," zero two in here right and first of all let me try to remove all of the uh ppm things right so here are all"
10279200,10287840," all the ppms and uh let me try to recompile inside stuff so uh there we go so now we have a beating"
10287840,10296000," zero left pad by the way so left pad didn't really require a third party dependency for a left pad"
10299280,10306160," i wonder if we can generate more like faster code for this kind of stuff okay so i'm gonna do that um"
10306160,10314880," so uh but i'm gonna do that for each individual tile there we go so here are all the tiles this is the"
10314880,10325600," entire tile set there we go the entire tile set and theoretically you can now generate a grid out of these tiles"
10325600,10335440," um optimization facts maybe uh so can i do something like d release is that a thing you can do"
10335440,10342800," okay so oh okay so that helps all right"
10342800,10352560," uh so that was faster i suppose it just passed all three to the gcc compiler right so that's what it did"
10353600,10363200," uh there we go so here is the the full uh wang tile set um so the next thing i would like to do is"
10363200,10373440," probably uh make an engine right that generates a grid of these kind of tiles right uh but unfortunately"
10373440,10378800," we already spent too much time working on this stuff so i don't think we have too much time so also the the"
10378800,10385360," tiles themselves are huge we can probably want to have like 64 by 64 so let's do it like this so i think"
10385360,10392400," this is gonna be yeah it's instantly generated all the the entire tilesets uh all right so if i try to"
10392400,10397360," take a look at that so this is the the whole tile set uh that's pretty cool"
10397360,10410400," did you get a new camera uh looking nice or did you switch the places i actually"
10410400,10416160," i think the lighting has changed let me take a look um do i look better now i don't know"
10417040,10426640," um how to tell so uh all right let me actually get to ignore all of the ppm files right and do we have"
10426640,10436640," yeah it would be actually better to do something like this and the release as well uh all right um"
10439920,10451200," okay so let's do a committee committee um generate the uh full wang tile set and i'm going to push that"
10451200,10459280," right into the repo uh i wonder if there is like super easy way for me to just place all of these tiles"
10459280,10466080," together so 16 it's basically four by four right so it's essentially four by four"
10466080,10477840," can i generate at least some sort of grid i think it's going to take too much time all right so i'm not"
10477840,10484400," going to do that uh all right so um this is what we managed to implement today all right we've implemented"
10484400,10494480," a simple wang tile set generator uh 256 and let's take a look at this wang tiles one more time"
10494480,10506240," uh so so here are all the wang tiles so and unfortunately we didn't have time to implement"
10506240,10512160," the uh you know the thing that generates a random grid but we're going to do that next time we're going"
10512160,10516960," to do that next time you can find the source code of this project in here in the chat if you're brave"
10516960,10525360," enough to watch zozin life and if you are watching in the uh on the youtube right so you can find all"
10525360,10534160," this stuff uh in uh in the description so maybe i'm going to actually put a couple of to do so uh wait a"
10534160,10549360," second so where is the wang tile thingy uh so here is that um um more wang tile uh ideas right so we"
10549360,10558400," need to have more wang tile ideas uh for instance uh metables metables so and if we're going to have"
10559840,10565200," uh some other ideas we're going to place them there as well all right so i just don't want to forget"
10565200,10572320," about the idea for metables uh right so in here is basically the description of how we uh represent the"
10572320,10579840," tiles and whatnot so so i'm not sure if this thing is really that necessary so but uh the thing that is"
10579840,10592080," necessary here is something like this okay uh so zero one uh two etc so then one one one is 15 if i"
10592080,10603600," understand correctly uh might as well also pad the entire thing with zero all right"
10608000,10623520," make the tiles bigger then um add more ideas for wang tiles right and um update uh"
10623520,10632960," tile beat mask represent uh description description there we go and i'm going to push that right into the"
10632960,10637920," repo all right that's it for today thanks everyone who's watching right now i really appreciate it i"
10637920,10644400," hope today's stream was interesting so we switched up the language a little bit so maybe nim was"
10644400,10649760," interesting for somebody it's actually a pretty cool language but it's been like kind of stagnating"
10649760,10657520," over the past and it's not really it could be a really good candidate to kill c but um"
10657520,10666080," i suppose a lot of developers dragging this language to different like directions so it's kind of not clear"
10666080,10669440," what kind of what kind of language it wants to be it wants to be like a low level language or web"
10669440,10675680," language because it compiles to uh c to javascript or something like that but maybe these days like"
10675680,10681680," web is the low level thing like browser is the operating system you develop for something like"
10681680,10689920," i don't know um like the premise of this language is actually quite cool but it feels like it under"
10689920,10696320," delivered on that premise i don't know that's what it feels like um well yeah and another thing you"
10696320,10703280," see language is not a secure but again you can disable the gc the all of them always say you can"
10703280,10710560," always disable gc but yet all of the libraries are designed to have gc and have no mechanism for"
10710560,10717120," you to manage the memory so they become useless so it's like ah this looks pointless nobody's disabling"
10717120,10720400," gc because of that this is i don't know"
10720400,10730000," so and you end up like calling gc menu or something like that it's just like"
10730000,10736160," it's a mess it's a mess anyway so thanks everyone who's watching right now really appreciate it have a"
10736160,10742720," a good one and i see you all next time on the second episode of wang tile generation series i've"
10742720,10749280," no i have no goal for this thing i'm just exploring the uh the idea space of this thing and see what i"
10749280,10756720," can do with it um see you all next time and uh yeah i gotta go uh love you all"
10766160,10796140," Thank you."
