629880,659860," Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, so today is Saturday and I'm just, you know, dropping plates and actually, all of that for the content, you know, all of that for the content."
659860,689840," We'll be right back."
689840,719820," We'll be right back."
719820,749800," So, yeah, so, yeah, so, yeah, so, yeah, so, yeah."
749800,779780," We'll be right back."
779780,809760," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
809760,839740," We'll be right back."
839740,849020," so let me let me actually test that uh because uh also yeah one of the things is that the projectile"
849020,856700," starts spawning at the center of the player uh right and maybe yeah because of that it just does"
856700,863740," not affect some like yeah i think the the projectiles should spawn uh at the edge of the player"
863740,870940," so if the enemy is going behind it's not going to be affected by the uh by the player so yeah this is"
870940,877500," something that we'll have to fix as well uh mobile controls when i don't know i just developed this"
877500,887900," thing i just hacked this thing together yesterday so um um all right so let me start emacs"
891340,896780," if your tag get bigger something something back sitting okay cool thank you for for the for the"
896780,906380," ideas okay so uh what do we get uh so as far as i can tell uh columbia actually submitted a bunch of pull"
906380,912940," requests uh so that's pretty cool let's take a look at some of them let's take a look at some of them"
912940,920940," hello mcourse94 welcome to the stream uh so i did some profiling and found that it's a little better to"
920940,926940," not update size of the canvas element every frame i tested by launching the game in a small window and"
926940,938540," doing nothing on my machine i have 11 percent speed increase uh okay cool um window was resized"
938540,949980," window was resized and uh yeah essentially we just wait for the resize window and then we just do do this"
949980,962300," thing okay cool so yeah thanks for the contribution okay so i probably should test it uh and we don't"
962300,969900," even have any continuous integration actually we don't have any continuous integration maybe we should"
969900,974380," set up something but uh you know setting up continuous integration for like a browser game will require"
974380,981660," probably setting something up like a headless browser of some sort and whatnot i don't want to do that i mean"
981660,990140," it's not fun it's not even programming in my opinion um all right so let's face the latest changes"
997100,1005180," let's actually merge origin and let's actually merge origin master origin and master so i guess the changes"
1005180,1018540," actually contain uh yeah yeah so now let me actually open this entire thing in here in the browser so yeah"
1021420,1030940," it's pretty it's pretty it's pretty good all right nothing particularly um special so next pull request"
1030940,1036220," next pull request make polar function part of v2 class a little bit of bike shading"
1037820,1052140," uh now polar v2 function is a static method of polar uh of of v2"
1055740,1068860," uh ultra hardcore mode when bullets wrap around the screen and can damage you"
1068860,1076620," we haven't finished the game yet i mean it's it's cool that you guys have you guys have a lot of ideas"
1077260,1085980," uh but i mean we need to finish the thing for first right so i remember like uh i saw one of the game"
1085980,1092060," developers on twitch i don't i don't know if he still streams uh but he said a pretty interesting"
1092060,1099500," thing about the game development is that the game uh is like uh it's like a dish right you don't"
1099500,1106140," make a great dish by throwing as many components uh like ingredients into it as possible right so you"
1106140,1111500," pick uh specifically the companies that actually complement each other right and then you build the"
1111500,1119180," basic dish and then you see what other ingredients you can add to improve the dish right so the dish"
1119180,1125900," is not finished yet so it's pointless to throw more ingredients until you actually find the combination of"
1125900,1132940," ingredients that actually fit together right uh the games are not about as many features as possible as"
1132940,1140220," possible the games are about combinations of features right uh i think to be fair personally"
1140220,1146620," um you can say that about any software right not only games but just generally right so individual"
1146620,1152380," features like don't matter they just literally don't matter it's the combination of features"
1152380,1157980," that matters so features that fit together makes an ergonomic application they also make an ergonomic"
1157980,1163660," language and ergonomic programming language they also make an interesting game yeah so yeah it's it's cool"
1163660,1169820," that you guys have idea but this thing is not pretty finished yet job well no it was not your blow it was"
1169820,1170300," somebody else"
1170300,1177580," i remember i wish i remembered his name but i forgot"
1179340,1185820," he also had pretty cool uh drawing channel he also yeah because he also draws all of the art for the his"
1185820,1192380," games and he also makes all the music for his games he is very creative person um but yeah he doesn't"
1192380,1203420," really stream anymore unfortunately um all right so uh thanks for the contribution"
1206540,1213420," okay i'm gonna merge that as well bike shading so well i mean the only reason why i'm merging this"
1213420,1218940," pull request is that it's a very small bike shading and i can completely comprehend it quite often people"
1218940,1226700," may send me like 300 lines of bike shading pull requests literally restyling my code without changing"
1226700,1234300," any functionality or or fixing any bugs seriously i quite often get this kind of pull request i think i should"
1234300,1239980," start collecting them or something like make it like a wall of bike bike shading when people submit like"
1239980,1244940," huge pull requests just restyling everything without changing anything in the functionality"
1244940,1249180," and and also the title something like i improved your projects"
1249180,1259500," it's so funny every time to just like look through that and and what's funny is that you don't even know"
1259500,1267900," how to react to that like you uh you just like left speechless like what did you do like it's like"
1267900,1275900," the meme my job here is done but you didn't do anything like okay um so yeah thank you so much"
1275900,1286300," for the contributions i really appreciate them um so did i did i fetch everything i think i probably"
1286300,1293100," fetched everything also i have to be super careful when i'm gonna be going out to the kitchen for for"
1293100,1300220," the water because there's a lot of like glass in here so luckily i have slippers so it shouldn't be that"
1300220,1309660," dangerous we'll see we'll see see how it goes uh but i cannot be distracted by that because a show"
1309660,1317180," show must go on right show must go on it is what it is chat and it isn't what it isn't uh so uh merge"
1317180,1326460," origin master and everything seems to be okie dokie a karaoke uh so yeah does it did it change anything i"
1326460,1328140," don't think it actually changed anything"
1328140,1340700," so we might want to start probably from uh like actually making the bullets start from the end of the"
1340700,1350380," player uh bullets uh bullets uh bullet spawn uh point you know what i mean like a start building spawn point"
1350380,1358860," also i created a lot of uh issues for finishing the game and i also split them into uh different"
1358860,1366860," milestones and uh after we're done with the bullet spawn point i want to uh start going through the uh"
1366860,1373580," issues in the milestone right so and i have a lot of things to actually implement there so first uh we're"
1373580,1378780," going to make the the game feature complete once the game feature complete i'm going to be uh starting"
1378780,1387420," doing like a major um major polishing right major polishing and everything uh after that everything that"
1387420,1392940," is not as a that is not in a milestone is going to be like a minor polishing that maybe we will do maybe"
1392940,1400300," will not do uh or something like that so yeah it's going to be interesting to do so and of course we're"
1400300,1406940," still learning javascript i still don't know anything about javascript yes we're still learning we're still"
1406940,1421340," learning all right so uh yeah bullets spawn point there we go so let me open uh this file oh by the way uh"
1421340,1428620," uh after before the stream after the stream after the yesterday stream supini looked into my code and"
1428620,1435180," he noticed a very interesting thing he actually brought up a very interesting point i would even say"
1435180,1444860," right so um essentially why a game is not a global uh variable right if you make a game a global variable"
1444860,1451420," you'll be able to actually access it in the console and for example do something with this right so uh"
1451420,1458540," uh that's actually way better uh just just keep it global and you'll be able to modify it um so let me"
1458540,1466060," actually open it like like that here uh and then i'm gonna go to the console there hola and then in the"
1466060,1471820," game i will be able to print the game and here's the game i can inspect it and so on and so forth i can"
1471820,1480780," probably now do something like game uh bullets right and is that how we do that oh yeah you put an expression"
1480780,1488140," here it's it's actually search okay so here's the game bullets and uh yeah as you can see uh as i uh"
1488140,1494140," throw more bullets uh it adds to the list but over time they actually die right over time they actually die"
1495020,1499820," so that's a pretty convenient thing yeah that's pretty convenient i really like this idea i mean"
1499820,1505180," supini is a professional uh javascript developer so no he know he knows a lot of these kind of tricks so i"
1505180,1511020," really appreciate him actually looking into the into my game and giving suggestions so that's that's pretty"
1511020,1519020," cool um all right and to be fair like chromium dev tools like chrome dev tools are pretty powerful tool"
1519020,1524940," for profiling debugging and inspecting the javascript code it's actually amazing it's way better than"
1524940,1529100," what we had at the beginning of the web development era in internet explorers and shit like that"
1529100,1539900," because i remember like i had as as part of my job um debug web applications in internet explorer 8"
1540540,1546860," and using internet explorer 8 dev tools it's horrible you can do things in in there you can"
1546860,1552860," actually do things there but it's just so horrible and unusable oh my god so and after that switching to"
1552860,1566860," dev tools in chromium is just such a blessing oh my god um anyways it is what it is and it isn't what it"
1566860,1573260," isn't yeah internet explorer yes i was actually developing uh in javascript for internet explorer"
1573260,1578860," i'm joking i'm joking i never actually touched javascript in my entire life i know nothing about"
1578860,1586300," it and this is me the second day of learning javascript right so i i know nothing about it right i know nothing"
1586300,1598700," about it anyways uh so let me see let me see so uh here's where we do the shooting right so we first"
1598700,1604460," establish the position so this is from where we start the bullet right this is from where we start the"
1604460,1611420," bullet and then we have a bullet velocity uh so essentially first to determine the bullet velocity we"
1611420,1616780," are didn't mind the bullet direction right so maybe i should extract that to a separate function like"
1616780,1625500," bullet uh direction right so here's the bullet direction um and then using the bullet direction"
1625500,1633260," uh i will calculate the bullet velocity um so what's interesting is that i think i should not use the mouse"
1634700,1640620," uh this is just a mouse position yeah i shouldn't use the player position uh for the initial bullet"
1640620,1647020," position so essentially how i want to do that uh bullet position i'm gonna start with the player"
1647020,1656540," position right i'm gonna start with the player position and add uh bullet direction right bullet direction"
1656540,1665500," but i'm gonna scale it to the size of the radius of the player player radius plus the bullet radius right"
1665500,1669820," you see we see you see what i'm doing here you see what i'm doing here essentially"
1683100,1692780," uh so i'll have to wait a little bit because i have a very slow laptop i'm really sorry uh okay so let me"
1692780,1702060," create a circle so here's the player and essentially i start from here and i have a direction for the bullet"
1702060,1711420," so i extend the spawning position to here and i extend it a little bit more to the radius of the bullet"
1711420,1717340," that is going to be spawned so and this is how i determine uh the spawning position of the bullet"
1717340,1722700," so essentially if the enemy goes from behind and you shoot into a different direction it won't be"
1722700,1726860," affected by the bullet because before bullet would be actually spawning inside of the player"
1726860,1732300," right and because of that enemies that go in through different directions they will be essentially um"
1732300,1739900," they will be essentially killed by the bullet inside of the player right and yeah as we introduce"
1739900,1746380," damage by the way i want the enemy to die when they hit the player as well but on top of dying"
1746380,1751740," they're also going to damage you so basically if the enemy touches you you lose the health"
1751740,1757740," right so and if you're shooting in a in a different direction so the enemies that will uh come to you"
1757740,1764540," from different directions they will 100 damage you unless you actually point at them so that will sort of"
1764540,1770140," force you to point at enemies hopefully we'll see how it goes so right now we don't have any damage or"
1770140,1777020," anything like that all right so it is what it is and it isn't what it isn't um"
1781340,1786940," all right so um let me see let me see"
1786940,1797660," so this is the bullet position and i just set the bullet position uh right here right so let's see how"
1797660,1803500," it goes uh let's see how it goes did i already close everything i think i already closed everything so i'll"
1803500,1812780," have to go in here and open the chromium uh what's your opinion on typescript it could help uh to show"
1812780,1818060," what functions are available with current object i know nothing about typescript i only learning"
1818060,1823660," this kind of technologies for the first time i've been programming in java interface enterprise for the"
1823660,1830540," last the last 15 years so i have no idea so i'm sorry um yeah i'm not a web developer at all"
1830540,1839180," so anyway so yeah everything seems to be working right if i'm shooting yeah yeah yeah so it's still kind of"
1847500,1850620," yeah they even have like some time to"
1850620,1858780," yeah so the things that going from behind they're not getting affected but yeah so when the only reason"
1858780,1865020," why you still can uh stay in the same place and shoot is because they are not damaged at all right so"
1865020,1871420," yeah they're not destroyed when you actually hit uh when they actually hit the players so but apart"
1871420,1878060," apart from that i think i i managed to achieve what i wanted essentially all right uh i managed to achieve"
1878060,1878860," what i wanted"
1878860,1885500," all right so let's go ahead and commit that i suppose"
1885500,1893020," um all right spawn uh bullets"
1893020,1901180," at the edge of the player the edge of the player uh all right so"
1901420,1905020," i want to go quickly to the kitchen because i need to bring another ball"
1905020,1909900," because the one that i had with me i don't have it anymore"
1909900,1916220," and i usually put the disposal uh disposed TVs there so i need to bring another one to"
1916220,1924140," actually smash it off the of the floor so yeah hello nitrix life hello lazy greet hello hello welcome"
1924140,1929020," welcome everyone who just joined i'm gonna quickly go to the kitchen so don't go anywhere it's gonna be super"
1929020,1958620," quick quick um another one another one another one all right chat how we doing how we doing"
1959020,1966380," okay so i'm gonna make a quickly cup of tea and if you have any other questions about game"
1966380,1973020," development web development uh software development uh your mom development feel free to ask me"
1973020,1978860," and i'll try my best to answer them uh just don't drop this one okay i'll try it"
1981340,1989820," i'll do my best goody nice it's really i'm really glad to hear that it's a goody um yeah"
1989820,1997020," does anyone have any questions i'm reading the chat"
1997020,2004700," by the way do you guys like javascript what is your favorite programming language for the web chat"
2004700,2005820," what do you use for the web"
2005820,2015180," you guys like javascript nice okay so it's really nice to hear it's really nice to hear the best language"
2015180,2027980," ever uh oh another good question uh html versus css which one do you like better so um bm on wasm one"
2029660,2035900," i don't know we have an issue for that you can implement that uh css only css both okay"
2035900,2045100," your mom nice uh okay so yeah i'm gonna quickly go and turn on the kettle don't go anywhere and i'm"
2045100,2062620," i'm gonna be quick quick quick back quick back yeah i definitely need some tea"
2062620,2089660," what's up epic web developers"
2092620,2102220," htss interesting so what is htss never heard of it"
2102220,2111260," um so what's funny is that we don't really have um you know"
2111260,2118540," continuous integration so what i'm thinking is that maybe because of that i shouldn't bother with"
2118540,2126060," separate branches because they're only gonna stop uh only gonna introduce additional fraction for"
2126060,2133580," friction not not fraction friction so uh i'm gonna quickly switch to the to the master and uh maybe"
2133580,2140140," just merge everything here maybe even fast forward it uh and just uh push that right into the master"
2140140,2144060," all right so we're not gonna have any branches here because we don't even have a continuous integration"
2144860,2146780," um yes at all"
2146780,2156060," so okay let's take a look at the uh at the feature complete uh milestone and see what we can do here"
2156060,2162380," no way to pause the game that is true that is absolutely true that you cannot pause the game"
2162380,2168460," so if you start uh start the game uh yeah you cannot pause it you can do anything about it"
2169100,2173900," really and that's kind of annoying and what i was thinking i think we should be able to pause the game"
2173900,2178460," by pressing space right uh and"
2178460,2185180," yeah it should just stop everything and also we need to have some sort of a q"
2185900,2201420," c ue not q q u e u e but c u e we need some sort of a q uh that the game is in fact um post"
2201420,2209500," that the game is in fact post okay my kettle is ready i'm gonna pour myself hot water and we uh gonna continue"
2210540,2222940," uh um"
2240540,2264060," alrighty so uh let me see let me see"
2267020,2267340," um"
2267340,2272940," so now let's pause the game"
2272940,2276140," yeah let's quickly do that"
2276140,2290300," uh so mouse down right so not really mouse down but key down um so what we need to do here we need to"
2290300,2297420," check specifically for the space right which is kind of like"
2297420,2301260," strange but i guess it's okay so we can do an event"
2301260,2308380," um it should be code oh yeah we are redirecting it to the to the game key down yeah to the game key down"
2308380,2313100," right so and then if event code equal to"
2314140,2317740," key space is it key space though i don't quite remember let's actually"
2317740,2321980," uh let's actually log that uh just to see what's gonna be"
2321980,2327660," uh let's lock all the key downs and let me see what's gonna happen"
2327660,2331980," let me see what's gonna happen"
2332540,2336620," this is not what i want i open the javascript file instead of html file"
2336620,2339580," uh all right so"
2339580,2346220," yeah and if i press space oh it's literally called space okay that's very convenient it's literally called"
2346220,2347420," space"
2349500,2355660," uh you so key logger exactly uh it's a key logger and if"
2355660,2358860," event code"
2358860,2365740," event code is equal to space uh we have to pause the game"
2365740,2371100," right so maybe we can do something like toggle pose right so we're gonna have a method that toggles the"
2371100,2376060," pose of the uh of the game uh and what is it going to do"
2377420,2381420," well this one is kind of interesting so maybe it's going to um"
2381420,2394700," it's going to just uh alter the flag right alter the flag um something like this pose equal uh not"
2394700,2403820," this pose right and using this flag we're gonna change the way we're gonna change the way we uh actually"
2403820,2409020," render the game right and uh the way we handle the inputs and stuff like that"
2409020,2414940," right so that's basically what we want to do here but we don't have this flag yet we need to"
2414940,2421500," create that flag in the uh in the constructor by the way is there any way to define flags within the class"
2421500,2425100," or do you define them in the constructor that's kind of interesting javascript"
2425900,2432780," class uh fields let's let's find out i don't remember because i remember in typescript uh you"
2432780,2438140," can define uh fields inside of this thing oh i'm sorry i don't know i don't know typescript i never"
2438140,2444620," programmed in typescript uh i'm sorry like yeah i don't know anything about it so um yeah we can have"
2444620,2452300," static fields and stuff like that but i don't really care about static fields how about other fields"
2452300,2460220," it's pretty strange syntax uh public methods uh what about just fields"
2460220,2466540," private instance fields public and private okay so oh it's a specification"
2471580,2479660," i'll have to initialize it anyway i suppose um public public class fields"
2479660,2484860," public private class fields so i already looked into that"
2484860,2492460," uh oh you have to oh my god yeah you have this weird syntax with hashes and whatnot i remember that"
2493580,2501020," uh okay and public class fields is just yeah instance field all right so maybe yeah maybe it's for some"
2501020,2509820," things that can be like initialized like that i don't have to do this um which is interesting yeah"
2509820,2518700," it feels like all of this stuff can be moved uh to like here right and you don't need construct anymore"
2518700,2523980," right if i understand correctly if i understood everything i saw correctly"
2523980,2530860," yep uh the player should be initially positioned at the center of the screen"
2530860,2536220," which may not be easily achievable or something like that but yeah i should be okay"
2537980,2548380," uh so if i uh now refresh everything everything was refreshed successfully as far as i can tell so i'm"
2548380,2558860," more or less happy i'm more or less happy um cool uh so i i really wish i was able to actually stop"
2558860,2566620," everything i think right now to stop everything i have to do that in the oh my god in the web dev console"
2566620,2574060," right so i think it's something like source and i have to pause yeah this is the only way to pause"
2574060,2584540," this is the official way to pause um so yeah just add debugger well yeah i guess yeah every time you"
2584540,2592140," actually press space just in execute debug wait a second uh that's that's genius wait a second uh who"
2592140,2599180," who who needs toggle pose literally seriously this is literally uh debugger is that a function or is"
2599180,2605340," that a yeah it feels like it's just this thing cool so i'm gonna refresh okay i press space"
2605340,2614940," and it didn't do anything probably because i didn't refresh properly did i oh it only works if you open"
2614940,2621500," devtools well that doesn't count i mean come on it doesn't work in production i cannot use debugger like"
2621500,2627500," that you you have to literally open devtools first and only then pressing space will activate the debug"
2627500,2634380," doesn't doesn't really work not a good solution i'm sorry not a good solution"
2634380,2638620," um but apart from that it will be actually kind of cool"
2642940,2648700," all right so i'm about to pour a cup of tea"
2648700,2655980," man i love javascript holy"
2655980,2662700," such a nice language finally finally i understood the power of javascript"
2662700,2666700," holy yes i'm so glad i started to learn"
2669260,2674140," uh cheers by the way"
2674140,2681900," i need them i really don't have that much plates"
2681900,2688220," and that's probably why i constantly break in all of my things like teapots and plates"
2689500,2699820," stuff like that do you miss memory management what what memory management you mean the solved problem"
2699820,2706620," what kind of memory management we already solved that problem you don't have to manage memory look"
2706620,2714060," it it's 2021 just slap a garbage collector on it and forget about it"
2714060,2721660," i'm sorry uh i almost dropped my plate yet again so i have to be careful"
2723180,2730780," um all righty so what do we get"
2730780,2735740," stop dropping things yeah"
2735740,2745740," pause right so and so that means i need to have a pause field in here right so i need to have a pause"
2745740,2753580," field in here oh by the way it's really strange how it just works uh if i never define pose"
2753580,2757900," and i don't like that and i think i know why"
2757900,2762060," i keep doing that i think i know why"
2762060,2769740," useless pony what's up what's up how are you doing uh all right so if i press space"
2771020,2777580," yeah it just works and if i take a look at the game pose uh it's actually true right but initially"
2777580,2781420," if i refresh this thing and then take a look at the game pose uh"
2781420,2790780," yeah it's undefined then yeah i could i probably make sense to uh the game pose"
2790780,2797900," not really toggle pause but just pause right it's undefined but if i press space yeah it starts becoming"
2797900,2802940," like true and false and true and false and i don't really like uh that it doesn't complain about that"
2802940,2807580," and i think this is because the javascript is not in a strict mode"
2807580,2815020," right so i don't really remember what strict mode exactly does but i do remember that it complains"
2815020,2822460," if you try to use functions uh variables that were never defined via var let or const so maybe that"
2822460,2830060," could be uh actually the way to go uh and it it is not so it's not complaining"
2830060,2833740," so it's it's not complaining so strict mode is not about that"
2833740,2838940," uh so which is kind of interesting but yeah"
2838940,2844620," but that would actually kind of cool if it complained about it but it doesn't complain about that"
2845500,2851980," i guess it is what it is do you guys know any way to make it complain about not initialized uh you know"
2851980,2859180," things because well probably maybe it's uh yeah you strict equal snope yeah"
2859180,2866460," maybe object freeze will work how does it will work how does it have anything to do with"
2866460,2869660," maybe i don't understand uh what object freeze does"
2871180,2876540," uh maybe i don't understand what it does but maybe it doesn't matter so let's just initialize it"
2876540,2885420," so maybe i should just accept javascript for what it is and start trying to fix its flaws because"
2885420,2891580," the language is beautiful as it is right you have to accept it right you have to accept"
2894620,2901020," all right so yeah you see chat i'm learning i'm learning things i'm learning patience i'm learning"
2901020,2907260," tolerance yes yes yes yes yes this is a beautiful language because it will teach you um all these"
2907260,2915820," beautiful things yes uh okay uh what do we get what we got so the pose"
2918620,2926780," uh the pose and uh one of the things i want to do here we need to stop updating uh like literally"
2926780,2937100," everything uh we need to stop updating everything um specifically i i guess if uh this posed"
2937100,2943260," right we're gonna just return from it right so everything is posed there's nothing to do here"
2943900,2955180," um and when we are rendering um so we could put some sort of um text some sort of a text on top of the"
2955180,2963020," screen right some sort of tips on top of the skin but also i like when uh the everything becomes black"
2963020,2967580," black and white when you pause um all right"
2967580,2977980," all right so this posed if i got this uh yeah there we go i used this"
2977980,2983020," yeah i don't know what you're just talking about"
2985420,2997820," yeah it has to post all right um so we're gonna stop updating everything and in terms of rendering"
2997820,3006380," uh if so we definitely want to render all of that render entities and also render tutorial oh by the"
3006380,3012540," way may actually complain yet again about how scuffed colors are in javascript like you they're"
3012540,3017580," literally strings and it's really not convenient because sometimes i want to be able to manipulate"
3017580,3018060," the colors"
3018060,3028780," uh for complaining about stuff you want a program called eslint i mean if i"
3028780,3032940," if i'm gonna start using npm node i might as well start using typescript"
3035500,3041260," like why do i need a half-assed solution in terms of eslint if i can just have typescript"
3041260,3045420," no so"
3045420,3049260," it doesn't make any sense i'm sorry"
3049260,3060460," since you moved everything else out of the construction don't you need to change every this"
3060460,3066540," whatever to whatever inside the class i don't know it works with this uh yeah but since"
3066540,3072780," yes typescript well we're not using node npm so that's why we're not using typescript so"
3072780,3087980," java java doesn't work in the browser and a cost of setting up java to work in the browser is way"
3087980,3091580," higher than the cost of setting up javascript working in a browser so"
3091580,3102060," people never look at the coast people never look at the coast people always like there is no cost for"
3102060,3107260," no cost for their uh technical solutions um you know chats"
3107260,3115740," how about we create a class called caller is that a good class"
3123740,3129660," so the time has come to introduce the caller and you know how we're going to store the caller we're"
3129660,3130300," going to store"
3130300,3145340," uh rgba in uh the normalized form from zero to one which will simplify the operations on on the colors"
3145340,3151580," right the preparations on the course okay so uh and uh we definitely need to set up some sort of a"
3151580,3160940," constructor so it's going to be rg gba and this entire thing we'll just set uh rgba so it's going to be r"
3160940,3165740," uh and we're going to have b uh g"
3165740,3175580," g and then we're going to have b and then we're going to have a there we go so and on top of that um"
3177500,3183340," i want to have a method that turns it into string uh maybe i could use something to string but i don't"
3183340,3190140," know how to over overwrite methods in uh class and i'm not really sure if i really like this entire"
3190140,3197340," idea so uh let's call it to rgba uh string right so this is going to be just a method and what it is"
3197340,3203020," going to do it's going to construct rgba string out of this entire stuff so it's essentially going to"
3203020,3214460," return uh the following thing rgba uh r g b uh a right it's going to be this r"
3214460,3227580," this g oh my god emacs cannot handle everything uh this b and this a right but uh since these uh values"
3227580,3235900," are normalized right they're normalized you have to multiply by them by 255 uh 255 and i'm not sure"
3235900,3243740," if um oh yeah so a is actually from zero to one it's like like a single exception that's that you have"
3243740,3256220," to take into account um you literally just define to string function cool um but i want to be explicit you"
3256220,3262220," know what i mean i want to be explicit don't you have to floor them i don't know if i have to floor"
3262220,3269260," them does rgba also support um floating points in in their valleys does it support them is there any way"
3269260,3276140," to actually uh to actually test that so for example we're uh having particles if i put like a floating"
3276140,3286060," point in here will that work let's actually find out uh all right so oh what the hell is going on"
3286060,3288540," uh"
3288540,3299580," okay so it seems to be not working is it paused is it because it's paused uh did they pause it no"
3300620,3305500," uh well yeah this is literally because it's paused um so let me"
3305500,3314140," paused so let's actually remove that for now and uh let's see"
3314140,3318860," yeah so uh what i was checking"
3318860,3324780," yeah i was checking the particles so we need to wait until the particles will start appearing yeah you can"
3324780,3330220," have floating points right so that mean the answer to don't you have to floor it is"
3330220,3336860," no i don't have to because everything works with floating points so you don't have to worry about that"
3336860,3343020," um so yeah that's that's the answer so you just literally didn't have to worry"
3344700,3354940," we just scientifically confirm that with facts and logic all right all right cool uh so maybe i'm"
3354940,3357980," gonna call it our gba to make it even shorter or something like that"
3357980,3363420," so the other thing"
3370460,3379020," the other thing is what i need some sort of a color manipulation right i need some sort of a color"
3379020,3379660," manipulation"
3379660,3395260," and to be fair like i have a lot of colors defined in hex in hex format so i need to learn how to parse that as"
3395260,3404940," well so how do you define static methods so you literally just do it like that okay static uh static"
3404940,3413660," hex all right so and it should accept hex color so the next thing we can try to do we can try to parse"
3413660,3419420," them uh i'm pretty sure we can use regular expressions for that uh let me see how we can do all of this"
3420540,3429900," uh can we do a node in here i think i should be able to have a node okay uh javascript regular expressions"
3429900,3447420," okay so here's the regex as the you know as the literal right as the literal and how can i have capture"
3447420,3461100," groups uh the only thing i want to have here is a capture group regular expression capture groups"
3461100,3468220," i don't see capture groups example where is example"
3471420,3476060," i guess it will just return me something right it will just return me the thing i want to have here"
3476060,3486780," okay so and if i have something like uh this uh 18 18 18 so that means i can match this thing against"
3486780,3495980," something like this uh hex color match uh oh okay"
3498940,3506300," so uh next thing can i have like a word is there predefined words and whatnot yeah there are"
3506300,3514540," uh we can just do it like that predefined words and i can say that i want to have two of them all right"
3514540,3518060," so and yeah this is what we can have here"
3518060,3527180," this is what we can have here and that didn't work yes i'm so happy uh why didn't it work i wonder"
3528300,3535900," um i said that they have to be exactly is that because word does not include"
3535900,3545820," uh does not include numbers i have a feeling that it does not include numbers no"
3545820,3556060," uh that's really strange so it's really dumb do do i have to where can i see all of these special uh words"
3557020,3566620," a regular expression uh alpha numeric yeah uh to alone the alphanumeric uh what's the alphanumeric"
3566620,3574620," what's the alphanumeric do you have a special thing for that uh nope they literally don't have it"
3574620,3581820," well i guess i don't have any other choice but actually construct this thing myself which is kind of"
3586140,3589580," but this is exactly what i was trying to avoid i just didn't want to do that"
3589580,3593660," apparently javascript is too scuffed to actually"
3593660,3598620," not need to do that okay"
3598620,3602940," so and then we're gonna have this into i think"
3602940,3611580," um two three and or maybe i forgot to that i need to escape this entire thing"
3611580,3621820," do i need to escape this entire thing no all right so yes it's very strange oh yeah so you also have i"
3621820,3627980," which probably means case insensitive maybe i don't remember if it's uh yeah case incentive okay so that"
3627980,3633900," means i don't have to have like the big uh part in here right that's actually pretty cool uh i don't"
3633900,3639900," have this thing and g means that the global you have to make it global so and then if i have something"
3639900,3647420," like 18 18 18 uh then i can try to match this entire stuff right and then if i try to execute that"
3647420,3654300," it never actually does anything like it doesn't capture anything so uh is there something like rejects her"
3654300,3659100," rejects her"
3659100,3663580," uh yeah i'm gonna remove that"
3663580,3673340," um oh yeah i have to put it here i see"
3673340,3676860," uh yep so"
3680300,3681660," uh"
3681660,3683740," okay"
3683740,3695420," i forgot what what uh i think i was used to rejects 101"
3695420,3698940," i think i use rejects 101 to test this thing"
3698940,3705100," yes"
3710300,3718460," okay okay so it seems to be working huh okay so there's nothing wrong with the regular expression"
3718460,3728060," per se uh it also has ij um which is kind of interesting so i don't really know maybe i just"
3728060,3734140," have to remove it oh okay i had to just remove g then it's kind of interesting so in in the rejects 101"
3734780,3741820," uh all right they do have g so i guess i suppose different regular expression uh system interprets"
3741820,3742860," like g differently"
3742860,3750620," so yeah uh they interpret them differently okay so that means i don't have to use this thing then"
3750620,3755660," i don't have to use this thing and i can set hex color like this"
3757340,3766220," uh all right so and that will give me the results um which i can probably uh destructurize i don't"
3766220,3772140," remember how to do the just destructurization in javascript javascript destruct"
3773820,3776780," um destructuring destructuring assignment"
3776780,3785740," to be fair is there any way for me to ignore some of the values of destructuring assignment that'll"
3785740,3790780," be actually kind of cool for example i want to say i don't care about this one right but i want to do"
3790780,3800620," rgb uh a well at least rgb right at least rgb so and then i can do something like this and uh do i"
3800620,3807020," have rgb okay so that means i can actually uh remove some of these things oh"
3807020,3812620," underscore is like a valid name that's very interesting"
3812620,3818140," so um ignore"
3818140,3828380," uh ignore some returned values oh okay so you basically miss it in here that's actually pretty cool okay so"
3829180,3834860," yeah i mean it would be better if it was like in other any other language where you just mark it"
3834860,3839260," with underscore but i guess it's difficult to do that in javascript right so i mean"
3839260,3849980," whatever so uh cool uh now we need to parse a hexadecimal integer uh right so now we destructurized"
3849980,3854780," all of the components right so essentially we can try to do something like this but what if it doesn't"
3854780,3862140," match by the way what if it doesn't match uh essentially if i have something completely"
3862140,3870940," different here so what do we get here we get uh yeah oh i see so it will probably return just null"
3870940,3879580," right it just okay so it just returns null uh that means uh i need to check for for the new first"
3880780,3885260," so it's going to be something like matches right it's going to be matches"
3885260,3894620," it's going to be matches and i can i just do if no else"
3899260,3908060," test it will work okay so that means i can just do it like that cool uh i can just do it like that"
3908060,3914780," and then i can destructurize this entire thing it's going to be uh rgb uh and just matches"
3914780,3924780," okay so uh now i probably have to do that like a let like a let thingy uh and uh what's next i need"
3924780,3931260," to take the hexadecimal number i need to take the hexadecimal number and uh turn it into an integer"
3931260,3939980," right so javascript parse hex number so i'm pretty sure yeah so there is a parse int there is a parse"
3939980,3946380," int and i probably can provide the okay so i can provide the uh the base there so if i try to parse"
3947100,3955500," int uh ff and i say it's 16 it should be 255 so it is in fact 255 cool so and after that i can just"
3955500,3966700," say uh yeah r is going to be parse int r16 and uh i can extrapolate all of that into several of these"
3966700,3973420," things it's going to be g and it's going to be beautiful okay that's pretty cool uh wait no no i"
3973420,3977260," don't really have to do it like that all right i don't have to do it like that i have to do it like"
3977260,3984460," slightly differently uh i have to do that slightly differently and it's going to be like this new"
3984460,3992540," color right so because i'm constructing this entire stuff and of course uh this one is going to be like"
3992540,4002780," that oh and since the components the components are 255 right we know that they are 255 we have to divide"
4002780,4014140," all of that by 255 right so divide by 255 all right and uh yes so that's how i construct this entire thing"
4014140,4019740," this is how i construct this entire thing and we're gonna just return this entire stuff but if it doesn't"
4019740,4025980," match if it doesn't match we have to probably throw some sort of an error uh is it's possible to just"
4025980,4034220," throw uh hello uh and yeah so i think this is exactly what i'm gonna do here throw uh already hello"
4037900,4050220," throw hello and uh so we're gonna say here um we're gonna say literally that uh hex color is um okay"
4050220,4059020," let's let's put it this way could not parse hex color as color uh right so this is basically what we're"
4059020,4064940," gonna do here so we're gonna do here so we're only gonna support this specific format we're only gonna"
4064940,4075740," support this specific format because uh because we only have this uh this thing here so color hex"
4075740,4079180," uh and"
4084460,4088860," okay so this is the only reason because the only reason why i'm even introducing this class"
4088860,4096140," is because i don't want to spend too much time like manually migrating from these codes that i use"
4096140,4103020," right so my yeah so it's easy for me to just have a class um for the color and also have a special"
4103020,4109900," constructor for the specific values that i have in my projects right that's exactly my goal and uh in the"
4109900,4116300," spirit of uh you know sorting software development i don't develop more than i need because you may end"
4116300,4121500," up in a very dangerous place where you're implementing a ton of features that you don't need"
4121500,4129020," so and you don't need to support like uh alphas in here right so one two one two one two because in my"
4129020,4134220," specific case i didn't have elf alphas in those values and you don't need to support these kind of"
4134220,4140860," values because i also didn't have those i am implementing exactly bare minimum of what i"
4140860,4148060," need right now to move forward that's why this solution is half-assed it's probably bad i do"
4148060,4154460," understand all of the rage in the chat that i i'm forced to ignore because i need to move forward uh i"
4154460,4159820," do understand you guys i actually read the chat i do hear everything you fucking say and it's very"
4159820,4166060," difficult for me to ignore so the only reason why i'm doing it the way i do it is because it is bare"
4166060,4178300," minimum for me to move forward does anyone have any questions"
4178300,4192060," can you ask usually i find issues while learning coding in python because the too many methods and"
4192060,4196860," keywords i can't remember them all remembering all that stuff makes you a pro programmer you don't have"
4196860,4203820," to remember them so essentially imagine that you have a uh module math and you don't remember what"
4203820,4207980," methods do you have there you can just do something like this and it gives you the list of the methods"
4207980,4213900," that you have in that specific module and it works for any objects uh right and furthermore for example"
4213900,4221100," okay so i have this thing i don't know what it is you can always just go help uh and just read about"
4221100,4226060," it okay it's it's a square root of x and essentially once you have all these objects in your scope"
4226060,4234220," you can explore them with just two functions help and dear dear returns you the list of the members of"
4234220,4239580," the of the particular object and helps explains what's what this object does you don't have to remember"
4239580,4246940," anything so uh yeah so basically you can start exploring objects in python uh like folders in the"
4246940,4255340," directory and this is why this particular method is called dear um all right oh and about hello welcome"
4255340,4261820," welcome to this channel hello hello all right does anyone have any other questions"
4268460,4272380," are you planning to use more functional constructs no i'm planning to finish the game and get the"
4272380,4275420," done i'm not planning to do interaction masturbation"
4280780,4292940," okay okay okay so uh we probably need to test everything i probably need to test everything"
4292940,4303500," so here's two things we have and also we have our gba so yeah"
4305500,4309660," okay okay so let me see if i did not uh actually break anything"
4309660,4316300," let me see if i didn't break anything"
4319340,4321260," you probably want to close this entire stuff"
4321260,4323900," um"
4323900,4332300," okay it broke something nice uh okay let's try to debug that first uh"
4332300,4335660," uh-huh"
4335660,4345020," it's also it's changing over time which is kind of funny uh is it not um"
4346780,4353500," um oh yeah i know what it is so now every time i set the player color"
4353500,4358060," uh i said the player color it actually sets it to"
4358060,4368700," so we usually use it in feel uh in field style i think yeah this is where we use it we use it in"
4368700,4380780," feel style uh all right okay so and yeah so let's not make it like this so i think every time you feel"
4380780,4386220," the color you always provide the core yeah yeah you always provide the color uh so that means i'll have"
4386220,4391580," to do it like that and then when i feel style i can do uh to rgba right and this is what we're going"
4391580,4392860," gonna have here to rgba"
4392860,4405260," uh all right to rgba cool cool cool cool and what do we have so another one i probably have to"
4405260,4411660," get rid of this entire thing right so we're using color uh of the player"
4411660,4420220," of the enemy as the color of the particle as the color of the particle so i need a method in the color"
4420220,4430140," class in the color class that replaces a um so yeah so i need something like color set alpha"
4430140,4439420," um maybe let's do it like this with alpha right with alpha uh which accepts the new alpha right and"
4439420,4445740," essentially what it does it constructs the uh the new color well i mean i i don't have to specify the"
4445740,4453020," return type of course i don't have to specify the return type so this is going to be this r this g this"
4453020,4463500," rgb and you can specify a right and essentially um so rgba uh do i have a particle color particle color"
4463500,4468700," yeah it's literally a new color and now i should be able to do the following thing i should be able to"
4468700,4479660," replace particle color particle color uh with alpha of this a this is basically what i wanted to do"
4479660,4485740," yesterday yes i want to be able to just have a color and then say that color but with that alpha"
4485740,4492300," yes and unfortunately in javascript like colors are strings and it's really difficult to manipulate colors"
4493100,4498620," uh it's like really difficult to manipulate colors like that and it just drives me nuts like this is"
4498620,4503500," why i'm creating this class right i want to be able to manipulate colors as it's you know as it's an"
4503500,4511420," object that has this components and stuff like that it just makes no sense um yeah and um i don't know"
4511420,4516540," i tried to google whether there is like a standard color class in javascript and apparently there is not"
4516540,4523980," and people were creating their own color classes and it's just insane um so yeah"
4523980,4541580," okay let's continue"
4546540,4557980," so"
4574220,4578620," okay so it seems seems pretty good it seems pretty good so the colors are not broken anymore"
4578620,4579660," i need i need some enemies"
4579660,4589340," okay okay perfect so the the particles are handled correctly so yeah i refactored colors so yeah everything"
4589340,4595820," is handled correctly i'm super happy about that uh yeah so accidentally clicked something but yeah"
4595820,4604060," overall uh i introduced the color class and whatnot and the reason by the way i was messing with"
4604060,4612140," the color class is because now it will make it it easier to have pretty cool effects for example i"
4612140,4619260," want to make the whole game black and white when it goes to pose right so and uh the way uh i will"
4619260,4627020," be able to do that is by introducing the new method uh you know grayscale right which takes the current"
4627020,4633820," original color uh takes the current original color and turns it black and white actually gray scale uh right so"
4634060,4638140," uh and uh yeah since uh yeah since you don't have to parse any of these components you can just you know"
4638140,4644060," construct a new color and whatnot uh i think the easiest way to go about that would be to just take a"
4644060,4650700," like a uh i don't know maximum or minimum between all of these three uh uh i think something like that"
4650700,4658140," this could be math max this could be math max these are uh this g uh right then math max by the way does"
4658140,4663660," math max accept more than two arguments in javascript does anyone know"
4671900,4676700," okay it does accept you can actually accept three nice nice nice nice so uh that's actually perfect"
4676700,4684060," rgb uh so you can have a max and then you can construct a new color uh new color that uses these"
4684060,4689740," three three times it's it's a very dumb way of doing that i do know uh it's not like particularly correct"
4689740,4693740," color correct or anything but we're not trying to be like physically correct or anything right"
4693740,4698220," so that's what that's not what we're trying to do and also i'm going to reuse the same alpha then"
4698860,4704780," there we go so that way you have a color and you can turn it like a gray scale at any point so if you go"
4704780,4717020," uh particle uh particle uh color right and then now with alpha and then you do something like uh"
4717020,4727900," gray scale right gray scale it will make all the particles black and white uh so let me see so that's"
4727900,4734780," exactly what i'm doing here that's exactly what i'm doing here uh all right so uh"
4734780,4741980," okay yeah i'm not sure if you can see them but they are black and white oh they're gray scale"
4741980,4748140," right so and with this class now it's super easy to actually make this kind of manipulations you know"
4748140,4755740," what i mean you see what i mean um yeah so and once we have this kind of functionality we can do interesting"
4755740,4763660," effects and stuff uh yeah yeah cool does it make sense does it make sense"
4767900,4781740," uh so but uh right now we don't need to make them grayscale though we don't need to make them grayscale"
4781740,4792460," or anything i had an issue specifically for that uh so it was not really in the uh in a feature complete"
4792460,4797740," milestone it was definitely not in the future complete milestone uh but i feel like i need to"
4797740,4801820," implement it then yeah more control over color modification yeah this is exactly what i wanted to"
4801820,4808140," have and i think the issue is number one uh i think the issue is number one so it's going to be to do"
4808140,4815020," uh one yeah there we go so that's that's pretty cool i'm super proud of it right and it doesn't"
4815020,4821820," implement more than needed right so i implemented the bare minimum to actually have this kind of"
4821820,4827980," functionality and i didn't fall into the trap of implementing shed that is not needed like other"
4827980,4833660," color formats right i didn't implement support for other color farmers because guess what i don't have"
4833660,4842060," other color formats i just don't have it and by the way so here's the thing people are so afraid uh to"
4842060,4847580," quote unquote reinvent the wheel will which by itself is not a bad thing by the way in my opinion it's just"
4847580,4853260," like people don't realize that but yeah they're so afraid of uh reinventing the wheel because they"
4853260,4859340," constantly fall into the trap of re-implementing something that they don't need right so for example"
4859340,4863900," uh they may think i don't need i don't want to implement the core uh the color class because there's"
4863900,4869100," so many color formats how on earth i'm going to support all of them well just don't support all of them"
4869100,4873980," just implement whatever you need for that particular time and get the application working"
4873980,4879980," so you don't have to implement things that you're never going to be using like in your particular"
4879980,4885180," application it's just like you don't have to implement everything people don't realize that"
4885180,4893020," so people say i don't want to re-implement the wheel but what they actually mean i don't want to"
4893020,4897820," re-implement the car you don't need to re-implement the car to re-implement the wheel"
4897820,4901980," god damn it like people just don't understand that and"
4901980,4910540," uh yeah if you just need to re-implement the wheel just re-implement the wheel don't re-implement the"
4910540,4916700," fucking car um so anyways um"
4916700,4921660," yeah car quote by the way yes"
4921660,4925660," uh car quote by the way uh"
4925660,4932300," okay so why is this true by default let's actually make it false"
4934620,4939180," let's make it false cool uh let me see let me see"
4939180,4950460," so uh did i remove to do one did i move to do one yeah yeah uh more control over color modifications"
4963100,4968460," introduce color class uh for easier color modifications"
4968460,4974780," all right let's push that right into the repo i want to make a cup of tea does anyone have any"
4974780,4984540," questions while i'm making"
4984540,5000700," how do you pronounce the project name however you want"
5000700,5016380," no it's not oil gray it's just regular two right now"
5016380,5021660," how often do get push"
5023900,5029180," uh three times per day before before the meal"
5029180,5036620," that's how i usually do it at least three times per day before the meal"
5047180,5051820," all right i'm gonna go to the kitchen and turn on the kettle and uh then i'm gonna be back and we're"
5051820,5053180," gonna continue developing this game"
5053180,5058620," maybe i should make a small break"
5058620,5064300," yeah you know what i'm gonna make a small break"
5068060,5076540," it's gonna be three minutes"
5076540,5092380," uh yeah so let's make a small break you guys have fun"
5092380,5105100," uh yeah so um"
5105100,5105820," uh"
5105820,5109980," yeah so um"
5109980,5122700," uh yeah so um"
5122700,5126700," yeah so um"
5126700,5128700," yeah so um"
5128700,5130700," yeah so um"
5130700,5131420," yeah so um"
5131420,5144140," yeah so um"
5144140,5148140," yeah so um"

5178860,5208840," Thank you."
5208860,5238840," Thank you."
5238860,5268840," Thank you."
5268860,5298840," Thank you."
5298840,5328820," Thank you."
5328820,5358800," Thank you."
5358820,5388800," Thank you."
5388800,5390840," How can I have a global fill circle filter?"
5390840,5393900," Maybe it's going to be some sort of a function, right?"
5393900,5395060," You know what I mean?"
5395060,5400360," So, how are we going to call it?"
5400360,5406920," We can call it something like global fill circle filter, right?"
5406920,5408220," Global fill circle filter."
5408220,5411200," And it's going to be initially undefined, right?"
5411260,5413220," It's going to be initially undefined."
5413220,5421240," And essentially, before we're going to set the color, we're going to try to apply this thing."
5421240,5424280," I'm not sure how to do that."
5424280,5431700," Can I do something like if global fill circle filter is defined, I'm going to be applying it to the color."
5432220,5441320," I'm going to apply it to the color, I'm going to be applying it to the color, I'm going to apply it to the color."
5441320,5450500," And essentially, we may have something like grayscale filter, which accepts the color, right?"
5450500,5457720," Which accepts the color and returns you grayscaled, you know, grayscaled color here like that."
5457720,5466560," So, and essentially, if you want to make everything black and white, you just have to set global fill circle filter to grayscale filter."
5466740,5469420," And it will make everything black and white simultaneously."
5469420,5471660," So, this posed."
5471660,5477180," So, yeah, when everything is posed, it's going to be that."
5477180,5491400," And then when I toggle the pose, if everything became posed, if everything became posed, we're going to be setting global fill circle filter to grayscale filter, right?"
5491400,5496540," Otherwise, we're setting global fill circle filter to nothing."
5496740,5499080," To undefined, essentially."
5499080,5500860," So, we're switching it off and on."
5500860,5515960," So, I don't know, maybe it's going to be like, maybe we should have some sort of like ID filter and never actually check for the global fill circle being undefined."
5515960,5517720," I think it's a little bit safer solution."
5517720,5518900," You know what I mean?"
5518900,5525120," So, essentially, you can have something like ID filter, which accepts the color and literally returns the color."
5525660,5531200," So, that way, you never have to check whether you have the filter or not."
5531200,5535740," Because the absence of the filter is basically ID filter that does not modify anything."
5535740,5536460," Right?"
5536460,5540260," So, and then it should be pretty straightforward to do it like that."
5540260,5542560," And I'm not sure why it's highlighting it as orange."
5542560,5545660," It usually does that when it cannot see this entire thing."
5545760,5549180," But it doesn't make much sense to me, to be fair."
5549180,5551720," So, yeah."
5551720,5557080," This is probably because this entire thing is defined somewhere in a very strange place."
5557080,5559860," Okay."
5562360,5565540," All right."
5565540,5575000," And because of that, we're going to be setting this global filter into ID filter."
5575000,5575380," Right?"
5575380,5576480," So, yeah."
5576480,5578120," Essentially, that's going to be the default thing."
5581960,5583440," So, 13 something."
5583440,5585460," What, where is A?"
5585460,5586260," Whatever."
5586260,5588640," It's not 13 and 15."
5588640,5592720," Oh, all right."
5592720,5593400," So."
5593400,5601120," Chromium."
5602560,5603040," Okay."
5603040,5606220," So, let's actually wait until we have some enemies."
5606220,5606680," Right?"
5606680,5608540," So, because I want to see how it's going to go."
5608540,5609560," And there we go."
5609560,5610920," Here's the post thing."
5610920,5612560," Then we can un-pose it."
5612560,5614080," Yeah."
5614080,5615480," So, you see?"
5615480,5616700," That's pretty cool."
5616700,5619620," That's exactly what I'm trying to achieve here."
5619620,5629120," But when it's posed, it would be also kind of cool to indicate that with the text."
5629120,5629980," Right?"
5629980,5632440," Indicate that with the text that we are currently posed."
5633220,5634480," Uh, right."
5634480,5636200," So, that would be actually kind of cool."
5636200,5640120," So, and of course, we definitely need the text, by the way."
5640120,5641840," Text is 100% needed."
5641840,5647260," Text is 100% needed because somebody may accidentally press the space."
5647260,5651200," And they will, they won't know what exactly happened."
5651200,5655180," And the text posed will explain that you're in a pose mode."
5655180,5662300," And on top of the having text posed, we can also put, like, space to un-pose in parentheses."
5662560,5663080," Right?"
5663080,5666300," So, basically, that will also explain how to get it out of that situation."
5666300,5671980," Posing like that without actually providing any additional information to the user, in my opinion, is a very bad practice."
5671980,5672720," Right?"
5672820,5674740," So, it's a very bad practice."
5674740,5676360," You have to actually explain what you're doing."
5676360,5677340," Right."
5677340,5681560," So, to be fair, grayscale is actually very bright."
5681560,5683580," It's actually..."
5683580,5684100," Oh, shit."
5684100,5684840," Look at that."
5684840,5686060," Ah, shit."
5686120,5687460," We have to patch that up."
5687460,5689360," Oh, fuck."
5689360,5689860," That's cool."
5689860,5690800," I like that."
5690800,5692980," Ah, look at that."
5692980,5694480," So, you can actually..."
5694480,5694840," Yeah."
5694840,5697020," Poof."
5697020,5698860," Nice."
5698860,5702620," That's cool."
5702620,5705300," And, of course, it's just..."
5705300,5705440," Yeah."
5705440,5710380," Okay."
5711580,5717800," So, we have two things that we need to fix."
5717800,5721660," I need to fix the grayscale, because the grayscale is too bright right now."
5721660,5731400," So, we can probably maybe take the minimum between these components or take the average or something like that."
5731400,5732620," I don't know which one is going to be better."
5735980,5736280," Okay."
5736280,5738120," So, yeah."
5738120,5739560," I think I need to make a cup of tea."
5739560,5750600," Does anyone have any questions, by the way?"
5750600,5762720," Maybe you guys have some questions about game development, web development, anything."
5762720,5763920," You can ask me anything."
5763920,5781120," So, your permission to send messages got removed."
5781120,5783360," Probably because you're not trusted."
5783360,5784460," No."
5784460,5787080," You were trusted because you were subbed."
5787080,5790480," So, sub ran out and you're not trusted anymore."
5790480,5791600," So, that's how it works."
5793020,5793540," All right."
5793540,5796740," So, let's continue."
5796740,5810120," I forgot what we needed, actually."
5810120,5812620," I forgot what we needed."
5812620,5819640," So, grayscale is too bright."
5819640,5824420," So, let's actually try minimum."
5824420,5828420," Let's actually try minimum."
5828420,5838600," Okay."
5838600,5839880," So, yeah."
5839880,5841240," I want to wait until..."
5841240,5841460," Yeah."
5841460,5843120," Now, they're too dark."
5843120,5845100," If you use minimum, they're just too dark."
5845540,5849000," But to be fair, maybe the darker, the better."
5849000,5852520," Because you want them to fade into the background a little bit."
5852520,5852880," Yeah."
5852880,5856740," I think you kind of want them to fade in the background."
5856740,5859920," Or another solution would be to take an average of them."
5859920,5860640," Why not?"
5862060,5864440," So, let's try to take an average."
5864440,5867380," So, we're going to sum them up."
5867380,5869080," All right."
5869080,5870100," We're going to sum them up."
5870100,5876020," So, I just want to choose the one that is going to look, you know, the best for our game."
5876360,5877500," We're going to just divide it by something."
5877500,5881780," All right."
5881780,5885000," So, yeah."
5885000,5885920," It looks okay."
5885920,5887200," It's if you take the average."
5887200,5890660," Oh, yeah."
5890660,5893060," I think the average is the best so far."
5893060,5894120," Yeah."
5894120,5896040," In my opinion."
5896040,5896460," I don't know."
5898980,5928400," You know what?"
5928400,5929540," Since we use gray..."
5929540,5932580," It doesn't make sense to use grayscale like this."
5932580,5935680," Since it's a grayscale filter, right?"
5935680,5937400," So, since it's a grayscale filter..."
5937400,5940440," Nah."
5940440,5944580," I guess it's okay."
5944580,5947740," All right."
5947740,5949680," So, this is going to be our..."
5949680,5951260," But it's not just a grayscale."
5951260,5952800," It's actually a very scabbed grayscale."
5952800,5954340," But it should be okay for now."
5954340,5955300," All right."
5955300,5956100," So, paused."
5956100,5956660," Right."
5956660,5957820," So, we're going to have paused."
5957820,5959300," We don't update on paused."
5959300,5962000," And we also..."
5962000,5967180," Don't handle any of this stuff on pause, I think."
5967180,5979320," So, I think key up should be handled on pause."
5979320,5983600," But not key down."
5983600,5988280," But maybe it doesn't matter."
5988280,5991340," Yeah, it doesn't matter."
5991340,5995460," So, if paused..."
5995460,5997500," If this paused..."
5997500,5998500," Just return..."
5998500,6001320," Return from the function in here."
6002080,6003780," So, that's going to be our solution."
6003780,6003820," So, that's going to be our solution."
6003820,6003840," So, that's going to be our solution."
6003840,6005560," To the bug."
6005560,6006220," Right."
6006220,6006840," To the bug."
6006840,6010280," Right."
6010280,6013240," So, now, if I go to the..."
6013240,6014640," To the pause mode."
6014640,6015580," To the pause mode."
6015580,6016420," Right."
6016420,6017640," I click here and nothing happens."
6017640,6019600," But if I now go out of it..."
6019600,6020600," And everything is okay."
6020600,6022400," Everything is okay."
6025400,6026960," Oh, another interesting thing."
6026960,6030380," I think when I'm paused, I don't want to draw the tutorial."
6030380,6035000," I don't want to draw the tutorial."
6035000,6039720," So, one of the things I want to be doing then, if when I'm like rendering..."
6040440,6045660," Tutorial, only if not paused."
6045660,6048300," Right."
6048300,6049820," Only if not paused."
6049820,6054300," Yeah."
6054300,6058100," So, essentially, you see, when I'm paused, it doesn't draw this thing."
6058100,6063160," And the reason why I don't want to draw it, because it's going to be replaced by the text paused."
6063160,6065680," And explanation how to unpause."
6065680,6066100," Yeah."
6066100,6067760," So, that makes sense."
6067760,6068760," I think."
6070440,6074680," Okay."
6074680,6077140," And that's actually pretty epic."
6077140,6082520," So, and I really like that, because at any point now, I can just press space and maybe develop something."
6082520,6083080," Right."
6083080,6085180," And that will not consume all of my memory."
6085180,6086240," Right."
6086240,6091120," Because as the game progresses, it starts to spawn more and more objects, and they consume more and more memory."
6091120,6092840," So, yeah."
6092840,6098780," Yeah, that's pretty cool."
6100440,6114180," I think I pressed something."
6114180,6120240," Yeah, it's so easy for me to press on my bookmarks in here and actually switch away from the..."
6120240,6124880," From the page."
6124880,6129640," What else do you want to do?"
6129640,6131680," In terms of pause."
6131680,6134560," Did they finish the pause?"
6134560,6135100," Oh, yeah, yeah."
6135100,6135980," I want you to have a text."
6135980,6136720," Yes, yes, yes."
6137440,6144340," So, um, so, um, so, pop-up, uh, or maybe tutorial, pop-up."
6144340,6150840," So, what do we have here is, yeah, this is how you render the text."
6153000,6166900," So, let's actually extract this entire thing into a separate function, because I feel like I'm going to have, I'm going to use this function."
6167860,6181420," So, draw, uh, fill message, right, fill message, and it's going to accept the text of the message, and it's going to always set this particular style."
6181420,6185420," And it depends, actually, uh, it also should be customizable by the color, right?"
6185420,6186900," It should be customizable by the color."
6186900,6191180," Uh, and, oh, shit, that's actually super cool."
6191180,6197420," Uh, so, this is another RGBA that we're using that I forgot to, uh, remove."
6197420,6200100," So, yeah, it should be possible to remove it soon."
6200100,6207120," Fill message, and, uh, then I'm going to just copy-paste this entire stuff."
6207120,6210640," Copy-paste this entire stuff."
6211420,6214800," Uh, and we need to know width and height."
6214800,6215760," Oh, shit."
6215760,6221640," Well, we do know width and height in here, because, uh, we can extract it from the canvas, right?"
6221640,6222980," We can extract it from the canvas."
6222980,6228020," Uh, and in here, let's introduce some sort of, like, a message color."
6228020,6232240," Uh, actually, for this particular case, it could be just the color."
6232240,6232980," Doesn't matter."
6232980,6237480," So, this is a font, and this is a text, a line, and this could be a context."
6237480,6240300," Right, this is, this could be a context."
6241100,6243460," And, uh, we don't, we should remove this."
6243460,6244520," All right."
6244520,6248400," So, and in here, uh, I can do the following thing."
6248400,6254740," I can do, uh, I can do fill message, right?"
6254740,6257800," Uh, I want you to select only this particular function."
6257800,6260240," Fill message."
6260240,6261320," So, I provide the context."
6261320,6262460," We have to provide the text."
6262460,6263320," What's going to be the text?"
6263400,6274460," Text is this text color is going to be, color is going to be, uh, message color, message color, uh, with alpha, this alpha."
6274460,6277120," So, you see, I'm keeping using this function, right?"
6277120,6282460," So, that means I, uh, like, I introduced that method correctly, because I keep reusing it."
6282520,6283960," So, this is exactly what I need here."
6283960,6285520," So, now I can remove it."
6285520,6286160," Okay."
6286160,6287940," So, we need to define the message color somewhere."
6287940,6289120," How are we going to define it?"
6289120,6296260," Um, I guess the easiest way to define it would be like this, where I could do, like, color X."
6296460,6300420," And then I can do, uh, something like X, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F."
6300420,6301240," There we go."
6301240,6303680," And here's the white color that we can just then use."
6303680,6306960," Uh, that's pretty pogue."
6306960,6308800," Um, all right."
6308800,6312360," So, we extracted a function that draws on the screen."
6312360,6313640," So, it's going to be fill text."
6313640,6315580," Uh, yeah."
6315580,6316780," That's perfect."
6316780,6319620," So, and when we're paused, right?"
6319620,6323800," When we paused, uh, I need to find the class game."
6323800,6325260," I need to find the class game."
6325320,6326520," And then I need to find the render."
6326520,6334520," And when we're here, what I need to do, I need to do fill message for the context, uh, paused."
6334520,6338860," Press, uh, space to unpause."
6338860,6340860," Uh, yeah."
6340860,6342940," And the color is going to be message color."
6342940,6344260," Like this."
6344260,6345420," There we go."
6345420,6349820," Now, if I try to, yeah, open the game."
6349820,6354180," If I try to open the game, uh, let's see what's going to happen."
6354180,6356240," Uh, okay."
6356240,6358680," So, something went wrong."
6358680,6361040," Why message color all of a sudden red?"
6361040,6363340," I don't remember setting it red."
6363340,6366380," So, something went horribly wrong."
6366380,6371320," Uh, something went horribly wrong."
6371320,6373880," And I don't quite know what exactly."
6373880,6376520," Uh, did I parse them incorrectly?"
6376600,6378780," It feels like I might be parsed them incorrectly."
6378780,6381660," Okay."
6381660,6388620," Uh, message color."
6388620,6390520," So, how do I do hex?"
6391060,6394560," We always set this one to one."
6394560,6408980," It works for other colors, but it doesn't work for anything else, which is extremely strange."
6408980,6411300," Uh, let me take a look at the console."
6411300,6414140," Uh, all right."
6414140,6416040," It, it, at least it shows the pose."
6416040,6418980," And funny enough, it shows that thing as well."
6418980,6422140," Is that because we never set the color appropriately?"
6422140,6423140," Oh, shit."
6423140,6424780," Uh, where do we fill the text?"
6424780,6425940," Uh, I think I know."
6425940,6427600," Fill message."
6428980,6433660," And if, oh, it's, I see, to RGBA, to RGBA."
6433660,6435840," All right."
6435840,6436840," So, that makes sense."
6436840,6440900," And I can press the space, pause, press space to unpause."
6440900,6443220," Uh, okay."
6443220,6444640," And then we continue."
6444640,6445600," Okay."
6445600,6447580," And that's pretty, pretty cool."
6447580,6452140," Uh, all right, all right, all right, all right."
6452140,6454980," So, yeah."
6454980,6457100," To resume?"
6457100,6458160," Maybe to resume."
6458540,6459060," I don't know."
6459060,6461600," Yeah, that's cool."
6461600,6464280," Uh, then we can see."
6464280,6467200," Uh, un, un, un, un, un, un, un, un, un, un, un, un pause."
6467200,6472160," Okay."
6472160,6477080," So, uh, left mouse click to, uh, and, yeah."
6477300,6482060," So, if you accidentally, like, pause it, you know, uh, how to unpause it."
6482060,6483820," So, that's pretty cool."
6483820,6487400," Um, that's exactly what I wanted to have here."
6487400,6488500," Um."
6490600,6491440," It's also pretty cool."
6491440,6492500," Wait a second."
6492500,6499260," Can we have, like, a global filter on, um, oh, yeah."
6499260,6501340," We have a filter only on circles specifically."
6506340,6508880," Um, compilation is instantaneous."
6508880,6512840," Um, well, if, yes, if your program compiles."
6512840,6518660," If your program does not compile, the compilation is actually very slow."
6520720,6522340," Uh, all right."
6522340,6522340," Um."
6522340,6531220," So, so we introduced the pause state, right?"
6533460,6535260," And, uh, do we have a to-do for that?"
6535260,6536320," I'm not quite sure."
6536320,6537700," Uh, do we have a to-do for that?"
6537700,6542920," I'm gonna go to the index.js and, uh, to-do."
6542920,6545080," Oh, shit."
6545080,6546600," I have to do that slightly differently."
6546600,6548940," So, maybe I, I can do something like compile."
6548940,6555760," Go, uh, maybe I can just do snitch, uh, snitch list, right?"
6555760,6557000," Uh, list."
6557000,6558060," Just list all of them."
6558060,6560340," And I wanna, uh, find something about pause."
6560340,6561260," Yeah, here we go."
6561260,6563280," So, it's a no way to pause the game."
6563460,6563880," Cool."
6563880,6565960," So, no way to pause the game."
6565960,6567780," We introduced the way to pause the game."
6567780,6570580," And that means that specific to-do is done."
6570580,6571500," Um."
6571500,6574560," So, let's actually commit that."
6574560,6575620," So, was it four?"
6575620,6576740," I think, I think it was four."
6576740,6576940," Yeah."
6576940,6583120," Uh, implement pause for the game."
6583120,6586900," Uh, and that should close, uh, four."
6586900,6590240," Uh, introduce color class for easier, uh, color modification."
6590940,6595900," Uh, and I feel like I forgot to close that, uh, color modification issue."
6595900,6598240," Uh, did I, did I not close it?"
6598240,6599560," I think I should have closed it."
6599560,6601460," Uh, color."
6601460,6602340," Yeah."
6602340,6604360," Let me, let me quickly close it as well."
6604360,6606800," Okay."
6606860,6608200," So, let's just close this."
6608200,6609400," Cool."
6609400,6622080," My git have a to-do list, git text search."
6622080,6624500," Uh, I don't know how to use it."
6624500,6624880," I'm sorry."
6625720,6626560," Um, okay."
6626560,6629940," So, uh, let's take a look at the milestone."
6629940,6631700," Uh, feature complete."
6631700,6633440," Mm-hmm."
6633440,6635280," No way for player to die."
6635280,6639200," I think this is, like, a very important piece of the core game mechanics."
6639200,6643460," So, in feature complete, I actually put, like, very important pieces for the game mechanic."
6643460,6643740," Right?"
6643740,6645840," Like, killing enemies does not give any points."
6645840,6647480," Spawning rate ramps up too quickly."
6647480,6651000," Uh, so, things that are very important for the gameplay."
6651620,6652440," Uh, right."
6652440,6654600," So, uh, yeah."
6654600,6657800," Once we finish those things, uh, the game will be feature complete."
6657800,6658440," Right?"
6658440,6660420," But it's only gonna be feature complete, by the way."
6660420,6664760," Uh, so, it's, it will still require, uh, a little bit of polishing."
6664760,6667600," So, that's why we have more issues than that."
6667600,6670100," Uh, all right."
6670100,6677660," So, maybe the time has come for me to introduce the player class."
6677660,6681680," Because I have a class for, like, the major entities in my game."
6681680,6684280," Uh, and, yeah."
6684280,6686940," So, I need to introduce the one for the player class."
6686940,6693020," Will I try to make games on Wasm?"
6693020,6694900," I don't know Wasm, I'm sorry."
6694900,6695680," Like, yeah."
6703680,6712040," Um, so, let's create a separate branch for the death of the player."
6712040,6716520," So, let me see if I can introduce a separate class for the player."
6716520,6718500," Um."
6718500,6722340," Um."
6727980,6729960," So, player should be initially positioned."
6729960,6732640," I'm not sure about this one, to be fair, actually."
6732640,6735440," But, uh, I'm gonna address that a little bit later, of course."
6735440,6736960," Hmm."
6736960,6738400," Oh, yeah."
6738400,6740500," And, by the way, we don't have this flag anymore."
6740500,6742800," So, we can, we should probably delete it completely."
6742800,6744600," Because I don't even use it anywhere."
6744600,6745500," Right?"
6745500,6746840," I don't even use it anywhere."
6746840,6749460," Um."
6749460,6750980," Yes."
6750980,6751060," Yes."
6755260,6777840," So, uh, right now, player is actually just a position."
6777840,6778920," Right?"
6778920,6784720," So, because of that, we probably want to have a constructor for the player."
6785260,6788240," Uh, so, it's gonna be just a position."
6788240,6790100," And, uh, yeah."
6790100,6792940," We're gonna actually set it to this pose."
6792940,6793860," Like this."
6793860,6795580," Uh."
6795580,6799100," And, we also need, uh, methods like render."
6799100,6801320," Not render, but just render."
6801320,6802700," Which will accept the context."
6802700,6804580," Uh."
6804580,6806940," Do we need to have an update?"
6806940,6810800," I don't think player is playing any sort of animations."
6810800,6814880," So, that's probably why I don't really want to update anything."
6815260,6817280," So, yeah."
6817280,6820140," Um."
6820140,6822600," So, let's introduce the player here."
6822600,6824720," So, the player is gonna be just a new player."
6824720,6825640," Uh."
6825640,6826340," Like this."
6826340,6829200," And, we're gonna have just a position here."
6829200,6832220," Just a position here."
6832220,6833020," Uh."
6833020,6836080," And, I need to go through all the places where I use the player position."
6836080,6836540," Right?"
6837240,6840740," So, uh, when I'm updating everything."
6840740,6842180," Oh, shit."
6842180,6842460," Okay."
6842460,6846680," So, I'm basically applying the velocity to, to the player."
6846680,6847600," Oh, yeah."
6847600,6849300," So, I need to update the player."
6849300,6849640," Yes."
6849640,6851620," So, the player does need update methods."
6851620,6852460," That's quite important."
6853140,6853620," Um."
6853620,6855480," So, but the thing is."
6855480,6857960," It should accept not only DT."
6857960,6859240," But, also velocity."
6859240,6860660," Um."
6860660,6863100," Velocity."
6863100,6863740," Velocity."
6863740,6865620," So, and, uh."
6865620,6870060," That entire thing will basically update the internal position of the player."
6870780,6871340," All right."
6871340,6872960," So, it's gonna be like this."
6872960,6873820," So, it's gonna be pose."
6873820,6876460," Then, we take the velocity and we scale it by DT."
6876460,6877660," So, yes."
6877660,6879000," Uh."
6879000,6880560," We're updating everything."
6880560,6888160," So, this one is gonna be just player update DT and velocity that we calculated based on the."
6888160,6889720," Uh."
6889720,6890580," On everything else."
6890580,6891620," So, uh."
6891620,6893180," Where is another player position?"
6893180,6893840," Okay."
6893840,6897120," So, yeah."
6897120,6898920," This one is gonna be just player pose."
6898920,6899740," Uh."
6899740,6900180," Uh."
6900180,6900600," Player."
6901100,6901400," Pose."
6901400,6902660," Pose."
6902660,6904280," Do we use it anywhere else?"
6904280,6905100," Okay."
6905100,6910240," So, the other place where we use it is essentially, um."
6910240,6913100," For rendering the player itself."
6913100,6913600," All right."
6913600,6915040," So, for rendering the player itself."
6915040,6920500," So, that means instead of this entire thing, we should do this player render and just provide"
6920500,6924640," the context and move this entire stuff to the player render."
6924640,6925260," Right."
6925260,6929280," So, let's actually go to class player and just put it here."
6929280,6930240," So, there we go."
6930680,6931280," Uh."
6931280,6933660," Is there any other places where we did player pose?"
6933660,6934400," Uh."
6934400,6934760," Uh."
6934760,6935140," All right."
6935140,6936040," So, player pose."
6936040,6936360," Cool."
6936360,6937620," Um."
6937620,6946320," So, in this particular case, it's used as the pivot point, uh, according to which we're spawning"
6946320,6946820," the enemies."
6946820,6949100," Because we're spawning the enemies around the player."
6949100,6950160," Right."
6950160,6951380," We're spawning them around the player."
6952380,6952940," All right."
6952940,6952940," All right."
6952940,6955840," So, do we use player pose anywhere else?"
6955840,6957020," Uh."
6957020,6958140," Yes, we do."
6958140,6959640," But we do them."
6959640,6964100," So, player pose."
6964100,6964700," Um."
6964700,6966980," Okay."
6966980,6967840," This one is interesting."
6967840,6972300," So, player shoot."
6972500,6982660," We need to introduce, like, a player shoot, um, method to the class player, class player."
6982660,6984000," Right."
6984100,6985960," So, it's going to be something like this."
6985960,6986620," Shoot."
6986620,6987580," At."
6987580,6988980," And you provide the target."
6988980,6990360," You provide the target."
6990360,6990660," Okay."
6990660,6992340," So, uh."
6992340,6993900," Mouse down."
6993900,6996220," So, we need to take the whole code in here."
6996700,6997480," Um."
6997480,6999220," And just."
6999220,7001280," Actually."
7001280,7002880," Move it here."
7002880,7007040," So, in this case, mouse pose is the target."
7007040,7008320," So, I'm going to create a place."
7008320,7010660," Mouse pose with the target."
7010660,7013400," It's actually, there's only one occurrence of this."
7013400,7014240," Uh."
7014240,7016560," Then, player pose is just a pose."
7016560,7017340," Uh."
7017340,7019140," Player pose is just a pose."
7019140,7020140," There we go."
7020140,7022480," So, then we have a bullet direction."
7022480,7025220," But, bullet direction is already calculated in terms of this thing."
7025220,7026060," And, yeah."
7026120,7027040," Here's the interesting thing."
7027040,7029860," So, after we create it, like, shot at."
7029860,7031040," Um."
7031040,7034680," We should put a bullet."
7034680,7036260," Oh, yeah."
7036260,7037700," We can actually do a pretty interesting thing."
7037700,7040740," What if this particular method returns a bullet?"
7040740,7042600," Right."
7042600,7044360," It returns a bullet."
7044360,7049380," And then, whoever shot that bullet takes that bullet and keeps maintaining it."
7049380,7051520," So, this thing creates an object of some sort."
7051520,7052780," Uh."
7052780,7055540," That's a really dumb and funny way of doing that."
7055540,7056000," But, okay."
7056000,7056980," Uh."
7056980,7058180," So, mouse down."
7058180,7058780," Uh."
7058780,7059100," Right."
7059100,7062620," So, in this particular case, I only have a mouse position."
7062620,7063100," Right."
7063100,7064900," And then, I say, uh."
7064900,7071440," This player should add mouse position, which gives me the bullet."
7071440,7072160," Right."
7072160,7072960," Which gives me the bullet."
7072960,7076640," Then, I take that bullet and I add it to the list of bullets."
7076640,7078400," How about that?"
7078620,7079980," And that's the whole code."
7079980,7080540," Right."
7080540,7082080," So, when you do mouse down."
7082080,7083100," Uh."
7083100,7083380," Right."
7083380,7084620," If we're not paused."
7084620,7085720," If we're not paused."
7085720,7088220," We notify the tutorial that player shot."
7088220,7089760," Then, we take the mouse position."
7089760,7091520," And we give it to the player."
7091520,7092180," Uh."
7092180,7094060," The player creates a bullet for us."
7094060,7095660," And we put that bullet into the list of bullets."
7095660,7096540," And keep updating it."
7096540,7097740," Uh."
7097740,7099540," Well."
7099540,7100360," Yeah."
7100360,7101660," So, something like that."
7101660,7104060," Ah."
7104060,7105340," That's funny."
7105600,7107680," So, we can probably make this a little bit more explicit."
7107680,7108380," Uh."
7108380,7109200," But, I'm not sure."
7109200,7111840," Like, I could probably refactor it."
7111840,7113280," So, if it's not paused."
7113280,7114180," Right."
7114180,7115200," If it's not paused."
7115200,7115640," Uh."
7115640,7116640," Just make it like this."
7116640,7117000," Right."
7117000,7118200," Uh."
7118200,7120460," But, the thing is."
7120460,7121540," Like, it's more explicit."
7121540,7122060," Uh."
7122060,7123500," And, makes sense."
7123500,7124800," But, it's just easier."
7124800,7127860," Like, every time I want to not do anything."
7127860,7128640," When it's paused."
7128640,7131840," It's easy to copy-paste this piece of code at the top of the function."
7131840,7133120," And, just don't worry about it."
7133120,7134580," Um."
7134920,7136180," So, yeah."
7136180,7140020," It would be even cooler if we had some sort of macros in here."
7140020,7141160," But, you know."
7141160,7142260," It doesn't have macros."
7142260,7146460," So, because I would probably be possible to define for me something like."
7146460,7148840," Skip if paused."
7148840,7149700," Right."
7149700,7151600," And, just put this thing into that macro."
7151600,7151880," Maybe."
7151880,7153040," Maybe it's just whatever."
7153040,7153580," Whatever."
7153580,7154800," Forget everything I said."
7154800,7156780," Uh."
7156780,7157600," All right."
7157600,7158360," So."
7158360,7159920," Yeah."
7159920,7164140," So, do we use player pause anywhere else?"
7164240,7165840," Player pause."
7165840,7166900," Okay."
7166900,7168880," So, when I'm rendering the player."
7168880,7169260," Okay."
7169260,7171220," So, it's just a pause."
7171220,7174280," Player pause should not be defined anymore."
7174280,7175460," And, that's it."
7175460,7178340," So, I think we don't have player pause anywhere anymore."
7179100,7179540," Uh."
7179540,7181420," We don't have player pause anywhere anymore."
7181420,7186900," Imagine knowing at compile time when player paused."
7186900,7188240," This is not what I meant."
7188240,7199260," What I meant is, uh, have a macro that have a piece of code, uh, that I want to copy-paste in the places where I want to skip the function."
7199260,7203640," So, it's not about knowing, uh, where the thing is paused or not at compile time."
7203640,7204980," It's about copy-pasting the code."
7204980,7205800," Right."
7205800,7209340," So, instead of copy-pasting like condition, I could copy-paste like a marker."
7209340,7210160," Uh."
7210160,7213120," So, this function does not work if everything is paused."
7213120,7214120," Right."
7214120,7215620," So, yeah."
7215620,7218320," So, this function doesn't do anything if the game is paused."
7218320,7219360," That would be actually kind of cool."
7219360,7220700," Um."
7220700,7221120," I mean."
7221120,7222460," Oh, I'm sorry."
7222460,7222800," I'm sorry."
7222840,7224660," I didn't realize that you're joking."
7224660,7227440," I'm, I'm just a little bit, uh, a little bit tired."
7227440,7228000," Seriously."
7228000,7228680," I'm sorry."
7228680,7230220," Um."
7230220,7234700," Mm-mm-mm."
7234700,7243020," Uh."
7243020,7249400," It's been kind of difficult for me a little bit lately."
7249400,7252660," I'm sorry if I, uh, if I look very tired."
7252840,7264060," I always wanted pre-processor for modern languages because macro are nice."
7264060,7266200," You can have pre-processor in modern languages."
7266200,7267860," Whatever is that supposed to mean?"
7267860,7274200," So, I suppose by modern language you mean something like JavaScript."
7274200,7275280," Um."
7275280,7278560," Did you know that first release of JavaScript was in 1995?"
7278560,7281140," Is that a modern language?"
7282840,7283620," Um."
7283620,7284440," Okay."
7284440,7286960," Pre-processor for JavaScript."
7286960,7289420," Well, I mean, you can have a pre-processor for JavaScript."
7289420,7295840," I mean, nobody's forbidding you to have something like hello and put 69 in here and then use CPP"
7295840,7299980," P, uh, on index.js, uh, like this."
7299980,7305860," So, the only problem is that I think you have to do minus P to ignore, yeah, you have to do minus P."
7305860,7315880," And then if you actually put hello in here, right, and then you try to pre-process this entire thing, that hello was replaced by 69."
7316280,7320620," Right, so you can have a pre-processor in modern languages, whatever that's supposed to mean."
7320620,7322640," Um, yeah."
7323020,7330220," It's just, it would be kind of cool if the pre-processor for JavaScript was at runtime of, uh, the browser."
7330220,7335340," But at the same time, you can implement Cpre-processor in JavaScript and run it in a browser."
7336640,7344960," It's not that bad idea, actually, if you think about it, uh, Cpre-processor in JavaScript."
7344960,7346620," I'm pretty sure somebody implemented that."
7346620,7349120," Uh, yeah, there you go."
7349120,7353160," So, you can have a Cpre-processor in JavaScript, um, written in JavaScript."
7353160,7359100," And that will probably enable you with pre-processing JavaScript in a browser at runtime."
7359100,7360560," And this is kind of what I want."
7360560,7364080," Kind of, not really, but, I mean, yeah, why not?"
7364800,7367980," So, uh, this is a C, C-like, I mean, come on."
7367980,7369520," Well, I mean, maybe it's good enough."
7369520,7377680," Um, but yeah, so you can require this entire thing, then you can, you can take a file and"
7377680,7379100," then save it and whatnot."
7379100,7383540," And, uh, yeah, yeah, so you can basically have something like that."
7383540,7391660," Uh, so, yeah, how big of the implementation this is?"
7392960,7394860," I would, I would imagine that it's too big."
7394860,7397640," This is the whole compiler."
7397640,7401040," What the fuck is going on?"
7401040,7406820," Oh, yeah, uh, I didn't see anything special in this idea."
7406820,7410060," Oh, yay, something broke."
7410060,7412180," Okay, let's take a look at what exactly broke at runtime."
7412180,7413920," An expected identifier."
7413920,7414920," Oh, okay."
7414920,7419680," So, yeah, I, I left the pre-processor in the, in the index.js and that broke everything."
7419780,7423480," I forgot, uh, I forgot that I actually broke everything."
7423480,7426240," Alrighty."
7426240,7430840," So, move around, uh, jump and I can do this kind of thing."
7430840,7433660," And the player is now is a separate thing."
7433660,7434940," Uh, isn't that amazing?"
7434940,7436200," I think it's goddamn amazing."
7436200,7438540," Alrighty."
7438540,7443560," Uh, so, uh, what did I introduce here?"
7443700,7444420," What did I introduce?"
7444420,7445320," Uh, wait."
7445320,7449420," Am I still in some, in some sort of a branch?"
7449420,7451160," Why am I in a branch?"
7451160,7456800," Um, yeah, I don't think I want to be in a branch."
7456800,7459260," Uh, I want to, I want to be in a branch."
7459260,7462240," Uh-huh."
7462240,7463840," Okay, cool."
7465920,7466880," Uh, she's a worker."
7466880,7467680," Hello, hello."
7467680,7475900," Becoming JavaScript."
7475900,7478740," Yeah, I'm becoming JavaScript developer because I plan to work at Google."
7478740,7482740," So, yes, that's why I'm learning JavaScript."
7482740,7486020," I never programmed in JavaScript before in my entire life."
7486020,7488780," I had, like, 15 years of software development career."
7488780,7492620," And I haven't touched, uh, JavaScript a single time."
7492620,7496640," And this is me, like, my first, like, raw unfiltered reaction to JavaScript."
7496640,7500100," Uh, yeah, Google engineer in two months."
7500100,7503480," Exactly."
7503480,7505980," I'm gonna work at Russian Google office."
7505980,7506520," Yes."
7506520,7507940," Yes."
7507940,7509380," At St. Petersburg."
7509380,7513240," Mm-hmm."
7516020,7532600," So, what are we doing?"
7532600,7535600," Yeah, we introduced the player, the class player."
7535600,7537240," Uh, class player."
7537240,7540600," And, uh, we have a position in here."
7540600,7542780," And we probably need to introduce some sort of health."
7542780,7544160," Right, so it's gonna be health."
7544880,7546480," And, uh, what is it gonna be?"
7546480,7549540," So, how much health is an app health?"
7549540,7554260," Uh, player max health."
7554260,7556400," So, we're gonna, uh, put it like this."
7556400,7564540," Uh, yeah, in two months I'm gonna stop streaming"
7564540,7567360," because I will finally be working at, uh, at Google."
7567360,7570420," So, this is basically my last streams, right?"
7570420,7573840," Essentially, once I learned JavaScript and got that sweet Google job,"
7573920,7575200," I'm not gonna be streaming anymore."
7575200,7576200," I'm really sorry."
7576200,7578180," Right, so, yeah."
7578180,7580560," I, but I really wanna work at Google."
7580560,7582760," I like working at Google more than I like streaming."
7582760,7583720," So, that's for sure."
7583720,7587860," Because, obviously, work at Google pays way more than, than streaming."
7587860,7591020," So, that's why it's just, it is what it is."
7591020,7593640," Uh, and it is, and it isn't what it isn't."
7593640,7595520," Uh, so this one's gonna be 100."
7599520,7600360," Uh, 100."
7600360,7603080," Uh, and to the tune."
7603080,7605520," Uh, hmm."
7605520,7609080," Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm."
7609080,7613920," Okay, so, we have some sort of a health."
7613920,7615540," And, you know what would be cool?"
7615880,7620840," To display the health of the, of the player somehow."
7620840,7625720," Um, let me see how we can do that."
7625720,7628580," So, I'm gonna go to the class game."
7628880,7632320," And, when we're rendering something, like, we're rendering the game."
7632320,7636660," Uh, I also wanna render a rectangle."
7636660,7639520," So, we do have fill circle."
7639520,7641200," Right, we do have fill circle."
7641200,7642320," Where is it defined though?"
7642320,7652800," So, um, I kinda wanna define all of these, like, drawing things up above."
7654080,7657920," Like, somewhere, yeah, definitely after the color and somewhere here."
7657920,7660960," Um, and also, we have a fill text."
7660960,7662720," Right, we have a fill text."
7662720,7666080," Uh, it's actually called fill message."
7666080,7667920," Right, it's gonna be fill message."
7667920,7672080," Uh, where is my fill circle?"
7672080,7674320," Defined, I'm gonna put it here."
7674320,7681200," So, this is gonna be, like, um, um, simple utility functions, uh, for primitives."
7682000,7687440," And, another thing I wanna introduce here is, uh, fill rectangle."
7687440,7690560," Fill erect."
7690560,7692400," So, it's gonna accept context."
7692400,7695280," And, in terms of the rectangle, what is it gonna accept?"
7695280,7698240," Is it gonna accept the rectangle, rectangle itself?"
7698240,7706480," Or, would it accept just xy, xywh, xywh, and the color of the rectangle?"
7706480,7714480," So, the reason why I wanna do that is because I want the filter, the global filter effect rectangles as well."
7714480,7715040," Right."
7715040,7721120," So, maybe because of that, it should be called not global fill circle filter, but global fill filter."
7721120,7724000," Uh, which is a really funny name."
7724000,7724560," Not gonna lie."
7724560,7725760," Global fill filter."
7725760,7727520," Well, yeah."
7727520,7728720," So, let me quickly rename it."
7728720,7732240," So, it's gonna be global, uh, fill filter."
7732240,7733600," Right."
7733600,7737440," What's funny is that it does not affect text, but it doesn't really have to."
7737440,7737680," Right."
7737680,7738640," It doesn't really have to."
7738640,7740800," Um, all right."
7743600,7748720," Um, so, and it's like the idea of the global filter is actually so cool."
7748720,7749360," I really like it."
7749360,7754400," Like, at any point, I can just apply filter to all of the drawing operations."
7754400,7758960," And, the filter is just a function that accepts a color and produces another color."
7758960,7761760," So, I may come up with more different filters."
7761760,7764720," Uh, maybe the one that inverts colors."
7764720,7766000," Why not?"
7766000,7770320," Um, yeah, I can actually do it right now, I think."
7770320,7772640," So, let me, let me try to see if the game still works."
7772640,7774240," Shaders."
7774240,7778640," Well, these kind of functions are already sort of shaders, in some sense."
7778640,7781440," But, they're really not applied to pixels."
7781440,7783200," They are more applied to colors."
7783200,7786160," Because, you don't know the coordinates of the pixels you apply them to."
7786160,7786960," Right."
7786960,7789920," It's more of like, just, you, you work just with colors."
7789920,7792080," Um, yeah."
7792080,7793520," It's like custom shaders."
7793520,7795680," Uh, that's so very interesting."
7795680,7797440," Yeah."
7797440,7799680," Uh, all right."
7799680,7802960," So, let me try to come up with a different filter in here."
7802960,7805040," So, it's going to be class color."
7805040,7806480," So, here is the grayscale."
7806480,7808960," And, I can try to invert the colors."
7808960,7809520," Invert."
7809520,7811920," And, how do we invert the colors?"
7811920,7814960," Well, we know that all of our colors are normalized."
7814960,7816240," So, what we're going to do here."
7816240,7817360," We're going to do new color."
7817360,7818800," Uh, one."
7818800,7820960," Minus this r."
7820960,7823600," Minus this g."
7823600,7826240," Uh, one minus this."
7827360,7828000," B."
7828000,7830000," And, then I'm going to duplicate alpha."
7830000,7830880," Right."
7830880,7832560," And, once I do that."
7832560,7834880," Uh, in, in the grayscale."
7834880,7836240," Instead of grayscale."
7836240,7838000," What if I just invert the colors?"
7838000,7839520," You know what I mean?"
7839520,7840480," Just invert the colors."
7840480,7841600," And, let's see what's going to happen."
7841600,7843920," Uh, right."
7843920,7846880," So, let me actually do that."
7846880,7848880," So, I'm going to wait until we have some enemies."
7848880,7849680," Right."
7849680,7851760," Let's just wait until we have some enemies."
7851760,7853760," And, I want to have more enemies."
7853760,7855200," And, you see."
7855200,7856480," When I pause everything."
7856480,7857840," It inverts the colors instead."
7857840,7861760," And, since we have a system of global filters on the colors."
7861760,7863760," It applies to all of the drawing operations."
7863760,7865120," So, yeah."
7865120,7867520," I can replace grayscale with just inverting the colors."
7867520,7868160," And, it works."
7869360,7871120," So, it's almost like shaders."
7871120,7872160," Well, it's not really shaders."
7872160,7873600," But, it's almost like it."
7873600,7875840," It's just a hack that makes it look like shader."
7875840,7877120," Yeah."
7877120,7878640," That's, that's, that's pretty cool actually."
7878640,7882080," Okay."
7882080,7883440," Yeah."
7883440,7883680," Okay."
7883680,7885680," And, uh."
7885680,7887360," I don't really want to have like invert here."
7887360,7888240," I want to grayscale."
7888240,7890480," Um."
7890480,7892560," Yeah."
7892560,7893680," Background doesn't get inversed."
7893680,7895200," Because, it's not affected by the."
7895200,7896800," By this."
7896800,7897920," No."
7897920,7898480," It's not a bug."
7898480,7899200," It's by design."
7900160,7900560," Okay."
7900560,7900880," So."
7900880,7904480," Yeah."
7904480,7905040," Let's continue."
7905040,7909040," Uh."
7909040,7911200," All right."
7911200,7911520," So."
7911520,7912880," And then."
7912880,7916400," Nice."
7916400,7920800," So, what do we have here?"
7920800,7921840," So, we have, uh."
7921840,7923600," I moved some of that stuff there."
7923600,7924720," And, uh."
7924720,7926080," Let me go to the fill rect."
7926080,7928720," Let me go to the fill rect."
7930000,7931680," And let's just go to the context."
7931680,7932400," And fill rect."
7932400,7932880," Um."
7932880,7934400," Can, uh."
7934400,7935840," HTML5 canvas."
7935840,7937520," Fill, uh."
7937520,7938000," Rect."
7938000,7938720," How do you do that?"
7938720,7940000," How do you do that?"
7940000,7943120," Um."
7943120,7944800," Oh."
7944800,7946080," You just do it like that."
7946080,7946800," Surprisingly."
7946800,7947600," Uh."
7947600,7948800," You just do fill rect."
7948800,7950320," Cool."
7950320,7953520," But you also have to set the color properly."
7954320,7955120," So, uh."
7955120,7956160," It's gonna be context."
7956160,7956960," Fill style."
7956960,7959200," I might as well actually like set it like that."
7959200,7960960," Uh."
7960960,7962000," Maybe it has to be."
7962000,7963520," Maybe it has to be done like before."
7963520,7965200," Um."
7965200,7967280," Yeah."
7971120,7972320," So, we can have a function."
7972320,7973520," Something like apply."
7973520,7975840," The global filter."
7975840,7976400," Right."
7976400,7977520," It takes the context."
7977520,7978880," And it just does the following thing."
7978880,7979440," Context."
7979440,7981040," Fill style."
7981040,7982000," Uh."
7982000,7983040," And it just takes the."
7983040,7984640," Eh."
7984640,7985120," It's."
7985120,7986160," I think it's kind of redundant."
7986160,7988000," Because you always can do something like this."
7988000,7988480," Right."
7988480,7990080," So, when you fill rect."
7990080,7990560," X."
7990560,7990880," Y."
7990880,7991280," W."
7991280,7991680," H."
7991680,7993280," Uh."
7993280,7996560," And that's pretty much it."
7996560,7997040," I think."
7997040,7998320," So, this is how we fill rect."
7998320,7999280," So, we provide the context."
7999280,7999600," X."
7999600,7999920," Y."
7999920,8000240," W."
8000240,8000400," H."
8000400,8001200," And the color."
8001200,8003280," And it also applies the global filter."
8003280,8003840," And what not."
8003840,8005200," So, that's pretty cool."
8005200,8008480," Um."
8008480,8010960," So, now."
8010960,8012720," What we want to do."
8012720,8014400," We want to draw."
8014400,8017120," Basically health bar."
8017120,8017360," Right."
8017360,8018400," The reason why I'm."
8018400,8022160," Implementing this fill rect."
8022160,8023360," Is because I want to draw."
8023360,8024720," The health bar."
8024720,8026160," So, let's see how we can do that."
8026160,8028960," The health bar."
8028960,8030560," It should be somewhere down."
8030560,8031920," In the class game."
8031920,8036640," And in the render function."
8036640,8038720," So, we're rendering everything."
8038720,8040880," And on top of that."
8040880,8042400," We have to render the health bar."
8042400,8043760," So."
8043760,8046560," It's going to be simply fill rect."
8046560,8047760," And we provide the context."
8047760,8049680," And it should start."
8049680,8051280," Somewhere at zero zero."
8051280,8052960," So, width."
8052960,8054320," Is going to be the whole width."
8054320,8054880," Of the screen."
8054880,8055920," We're going to use the whole width."
8055920,8056480," Of the screen."
8056480,8057040," And the height."
8057040,8057440," Is going to be."
8057440,8059920," Basically health."
8059920,8061360," Bar."
8061360,8063520," Height."
8064160,8064480," Right."
8064480,8065200," Height."
8065200,8065440," Height."
8065440,8066240," Something like this."
8066240,8066880," Health bar."
8066880,8067440," Height."
8067440,8068960," But we need to define it."
8068960,8070000," We need to define it."
8070000,8074720," Health bar."
8074720,8078480," So, it's going to be around."
8078480,8080400," Const health bar."
8080400,8080880," Height."
8080880,8082320," And let's see."
8082320,8083520," What's going to be the optimal one."
8083520,8084480," Maybe it's going to be 50."
8084480,8086720," Maybe it's going to be 50."
8086720,8089600," And let's go back to here."
8089600,8092000," And something went wrong."
8092000,8094160," Something went horribly wrong."
8094160,8095600," Where is my console?"
8095600,8096000," Console."
8096000,8097040," Please show me the error."
8097040,8099520," To RGBA of undefined."
8099520,8099920," Okay."
8099920,8101040," So, in feel erect."
8101040,8103840," Okay."
8103840,8106160," So, that returned undefined."
8106160,8107040," For some reason."
8107040,8109360," Because I probably didn't provide."
8109360,8109680," Yeah."
8109680,8110560," I didn't provide the color."
8110560,8111360," Unfortunately."
8111360,8112320," So, feel erect."
8112320,8113760," Yeah."
8113760,8114320," Health bar."
8114320,8115760," And I'm going to use player color."
8115760,8117520," As the color of the health bar."
8117520,8118160," Of the player."
8118160,8119360," I think that makes sense."
8119360,8120960," Okay."
8120960,8122560," That's very interesting."
8122560,8125040," So, there's a health bar."
8125040,8129120," Maybe it should have some sort of like a padding."
8129680,8132800," But I'm not sure."
8132800,8135920," Another interesting thing."
8135920,8137920," So, let's try."
8137920,8138640," Oh, you see."
8138640,8144800," It also automatically applies the global filter."
8144800,8145760," I really like that."
8145760,8146000," Okay."
8146000,8150240," So, maybe the height of the health bar."
8150240,8151680," Should be a little bit smaller."
8151680,8152720," Like 25."
8152720,8155040," Because it feels a little bit too thick."
8155040,8155280," Right."
8155280,8156320," It feels a little bit too thick."
8156320,8157520," Maybe like around that."
8157520,8158400," Should be okay."
8159520,8160640," Okay."
8160640,8162240," So, that's cool."
8162240,8164240," So, now."
8164240,8169440," We want this health bar to depend on the amount of health of the player."
8169440,8169760," Right."
8169760,8171120," On the amount of health of the player."
8171120,8174000," Oh, shit."
8175440,8176640," So, essentially."
8176640,8176640," So, essentially."
8176640,8177920," I feel erect."
8177920,8181360," We're going to take the width."
8181360,8185280," And we're going to multiply it by the percentage of the health."
8185280,8185520," Right."
8185520,8186720," By the percentage of the health."
8186720,8188400," What's the percentage of the health?"
8188400,8189520," So, we take the player."
8189520,8190640," And it's health."
8190640,8194160," And we define it by player max health."
8194160,8195680," And that gives us the percentage."
8195680,8197440," And we multiply it by width."
8197440,8199680," Which is multiplied by width."
8199680,8202080," And it should work."
8202080,8202960," It should work."
8202960,8205040," Maybe we should implement something like lerp."
8205040,8207360," Something like lerping."
8207360,8209040," Would be kind of cool."
8209040,8215760," Does JavaScript even have any lerping in math thingy?"
8217200,8218720," Math lerp."
8218720,8220400," Mix."
8220400,8222000," Huh."
8222000,8223520," It doesn't have anything."
8223520,8224080," Oh, by the way."
8224080,8227680," I think I should be able to now set pause to true."
8227680,8228800," And it will continue."
8228800,8232320," And since I unpause the game."
8232320,8234080," Not through the toggle pause."
8234080,8235680," It will not reset the filter."
8235680,8236880," Right."
8236880,8239120," So, it will not reset the filter."
8239120,8242160," So, it's going to continue in a grayscale."
8242160,8245440," It didn't work for some reason."
8246480,8247680," So, I don't know why."
8247680,8248960," Huh."
8248960,8250800," All right."
8250800,8252240," So, that's really strange."
8252240,8256720," Huh."
8256720,8259280," Game."
8259280,8260640," Pause."
8260640,8262240," But can I toggle pause?"
8262240,8266000," Okay."
8266000,8266960," So, I can toggle pause."
8266960,8268960," But I can actually set it for some reason."
8268960,8269520," I don't know why."
8269520,8275760," All right."
8275760,8276400," So."
8276400,8302560," So, we don't have a lerp right now."
8302560,8303360," Right."
8303360,8306400," So, I'm going to set the health of the player."
8306400,8308880," This."
8308880,8310560," It wasn't working because it's pause."
8310560,8311040," Not pause."
8311040,8311680," Oh, okay."
8311680,8312240," I'm sorry."
8312240,8312800," I see."
8312800,8316000," I made a typo."
8316000,8317360," But I'm already over it."
8317360,8321520," It was just a small tangent that I wanted to quickly check."
8321520,8323120," But that's not what I'm doing right now."
8323120,8323680," So, okay."
8323680,8324480," I made a typo."
8324480,8324880," I'm sorry."
8324880,8325920," I know that I'm dumb."
8325920,8327040," I'm sorry."
8327040,8328720," So, whatever."
8328720,8330880," I'm sorry for being dumb."
8330880,8335840," What do I want you to check?"
8335840,8338000," I want you to check something about health bar."
8339520,8342160," How it's rendered when you don't have a full health."
8342160,8344800," How it's rendered when you don't have a full health."
8345840,8347200," It's going to be player."
8347200,8351920," And let's actually make like a half of it."
8351920,8354800," Let's actually make a half of it."
8354800,8356160," Oh, yeah."
8356160,8359040," So, if you have a half of a health, it's going to be looking like that."
8359040,8359280," Cool."
8359280,8362800," So, and what exactly am I working on?"
8362800,8367840," Am I working on actually the ways for player to die?"
8367840,8368080," Okay."
8368080,8375200," So, now we want to be able to damage the player, right?"
8375200,8376560," We want to be able to damage the player."
8376560,8381440," Damage value, right?"
8381440,8389040," And essentially, what we're going to be doing, we're going to be setting the health to health minus the"
8389040,8390000," damage, right?"
8390000,8393520," But we also want to set the bottom line for the value."
8393520,8397200," So, we have to find the maximum between that and zero."
8397200,8401360," So, it's never going to be like below zero, right?"
8401360,8402640," It's never going to be below zero."
8402640,8404400," It's always, I mean, it's not damage."
8404400,8405920," It's actually value, right?"
8405920,8408320," Cool."
8408320,8410800," This is very important."
8410800,8411680," This is very important."
8411680,8419280," Because now we need to code the interaction between enemies and the player, right?"
8419280,8421200," Between enemies and the player."
8421200,8424160," So, here is the interaction between enemies and the bullets."
8424160,8429760," And the next piece of interaction, maybe it could be another one interesting."
8429760,8431120," Oh, that's cool."
8431120,8433920," I just realized that I could optimize some of this stuff."
8433920,8438720," So, if enemy is not dead, we're doing this thing."
8440560,8442960," Yeah, that's cool."
8442960,8445040," So, we're iterating through all of the enemies."
8445040,8450000," And if enemy is not dead, we iterate through all of the bullets."
8450000,8454080," And if the bullet..."
8454080,8458320," Yeah, bullet can actually kill several of them."
8458320,8463840," But we can do it like that."
8463840,8464400," All right."
8464400,8468800," So, and if it's not dead, we can check if it's dead."
8468800,8473040," Also, it can become dead after this iteration."
8473040,8474800," So, we have to check it twice."
8474800,8476880," We have to check it twice."
8479040,8493200," And after that, if the enemy position and the player position is less or equal"
8494160,8505520," than player radius plus enemy radius, we have to damage the player."
8505520,8508960," We have to, first of all, kill the enemy."
8508960,8512080," So, enemy dead becomes true."
8513040,8514880," And then player damage."
8514880,8520160," And we can have something like enemy damage."
8520160,8520880," Right."
8520880,8523120," So, we're going to have something like enemy damage."
8523120,8525520," And let's define the enemy damage."
8525520,8526880," So, const enemy."
8526880,8527760," So, here they are."
8527760,8529200," Here are all of the constants."
8529200,8530240," And what's going to be the damage?"
8530240,8536800," So, how many times the enemy can touch the player?"
8536800,8539200," So, it could be something like..."
8539920,8543680," Let's take health bar height."
8543680,8545200," Not very height."
8545200,8548320," Player max health."
8548320,8551040," And let's define it by 5."
8551040,8552960," Something like this."
8552960,8555200," Let's divide it by 5."
8555200,8556400," All right."
8556400,8561440," Now, every time an enemy touches the player, the enemy itself dies."
8561440,8563040," The enemy itself dies."
8563040,8564560," And it damages the player."
8568480,8572000," I don't know why I was trying to recompile this entire thing."
8572000,8572320," Okay."
8572320,8573920," So, by the way, I think I need to set..."
8573920,8578000," This to the full health."
8578000,8580480," And just set it to the full health."
8580480,8582400," And let's see what's going to happen."
8582400,8585120," Something bad happened."
8585120,8587200," All right."
8587200,8588720," So, cannot read property."
8588720,8590800," Sub distance."
8590800,8594080," Player post."
8594080,8594400," I see."
8595840,8596080," Yeah."
8596080,8602480," Speaking of, Kolumbetka said that, you know, compilation is almost instantaneous."
8602480,8604160," No, it's not almost instantaneous."
8604160,8608000," Let me show you the speed of the compilation of JavaScript."
8608000,8611840," Start counting from, like, around this time."
8611840,8613680," When I refresh the page."
8613680,8616640," There we go."
8620080,8622400," The code compiled in four seconds."
8622400,8627040," It took me four seconds to get a compilation error."
8627040,8631040," That's the speed of compilation of JavaScript."
8631040,8631280," Right."
8631280,8634800," Because compilation is not just additional useless step."
8634800,8638000," It's a step that reveals these kind of errors."
8638000,8640080," It's not instantaneous."
8640080,8641920," It took at least four seconds."
8641920,8647680," And, by the way, the compilation also depends on what kind of things you're executing."
8647680,8651680," All right."
8651680,8665520," So, this is going to be pause."
8665520,8677040," All right."
8677040,8683440," Okay."
8683440,8685040," So, as you can see, you get damaged."
8686960,8689200," And at some point, yeah, yeah, yeah."
8689200,8690720," So, you don't die, actually."
8690720,8692320," All right."
8692320,8699280," So, when the enemy dies, all right, I probably also want to burst."
8699280,8704240," Like, play particle burst as well."
8705520,8708000," Which is actually very interesting."
8708000,8716960," So, now we have these two lines of code that essentially kill the enemy."
8716960,8718240," Right."
8718240,8724080," And I'm thinking, maybe we should extract that into the enemy kill thingy."
8724080,8728480," But, again, enemy kill will have to accept particles and whatnot."
8728480,8730080," So, it's actually easy to keep it like that."
8731840,8745840," So, yeah, cool."
8745840,8754560," All right."
8754560,8760240," Nice."
8761600,8764960," So, the next thing that we need to introduce here."
8764960,8765520," We need to…"
8765520,8776080," Introduce the state of the game when the player is dead."
8776080,8778560," We need to introduce the state of the game when the player is dead."
8778560,8788080," Then, we also need to introduce a queue of player being damaged."
8788080,8797440," Because, right now, there is no difference visually between enemy being killed and enemy actually damaging the player."
8797440,8800800," Well, I mean, the health actually going down."
8800800,8802080," Right."
8803360,8804720," I have an idea."
8804720,8804720," I have an idea."
8804720,8810720," What if we burst the particles in the color of the player?"
8810720,8811600," Of the player."
8811600,8813200," So, that's actually a pretty good idea."
8813200,8814160," So, essentially…"
8814160,8815680," Yeah."
8815680,8818480," Red particles indicate the damaging of the player."
8818480,8822480," And the blue particles indicates the death of the enemy."
8822480,8825280," Like, death by a bullet."
8825280,8826320," If you know what I mean."
8826320,8827760," So, that's actually a pretty interesting idea."
8827760,8829120," Will it help?"
8829920,8830240," Okay."
8830240,8832560," So, right now, the color, I think, is headcoded."
8832560,8836720," Where is the color, though?"
8836720,8839440," Oh, shit."
8839440,8839680," Okay."
8839680,8843280," So, the particle right now doesn't even store its own color, doesn't it?"
8843280,8844720," So, yeah."
8844720,8845840," Oh, shit."
8845840,8846960," This one is interesting."
8846960,8847200," Okay."
8847200,8851440," So, that means we need to be able to customize the color of the particle."
8852320,8854720," We need to be able to customize the color of the particle."
8854720,8858400," Interesting."
8858400,8858960," Interesting."
8858960,8859520," Interesting."
8859520,8863920," I was going to suggest that."
8863920,8868480," You were going to suggest the, like, cooler particles."
8868480,8869600," I'm sorry in the post."
8869600,8873120," I'm really sorry for reading your mind."
8873120,8879760," Yes, the color thing."
8879760,8880000," Okay."
8881840,8884400," I'm really sorry for stealing backseating from you."
8884400,8889840," All right."
8889840,8894000," So, then we set the color."
8894000,8894400," All right."
8894400,8895200," Like this."
8895200,8902800," And then I can just use this color with alpha."
8902800,8904240," Can't even backseat these days."
8904240,8908000," Well, I had so much backseating yesterday."
8908000,8909840," I'm kind of destroyed today."
8909840,8910720," Seriously."
8910720,8914240," So, that's why I'm so, like, not really energetic."
8914240,8918480," Because I had to take all of that backseating yesterday and ignore it."
8918480,8922480," And yesterday's stream was really, really tiring."
8922480,8924960," And I don't know why I decided to continue this topic today."
8924960,8926480," I kind of slightly regret it."
8926480,8928480," All right."
8928480,8931760," So, let me actually make a small break because I really want to pee."
8931760,8935920," I probably also need to refill my water."
8935920,8939040," Small break."
8945040,8948800," Yeah, it's nothing about JS, to be fair, in my opinion, no offense."
8948800,8953760," It's more of a, like, the idea of the game is kind of, like, turns out pretty cool."
8953760,8954480," I really like it."
8954480,8956240," I really like how it turns out."
8956880,8963920," So, yeah, I would probably have as much fun as it would, like, as right now if I implemented that in C."
8963920,8966240," But the difference is that nobody would watch that."
8966240,8967280," Right."
8967280,8969440," Because who fucking cares about these boomer languages?"
8970640,8971040," All right."
8971040,8973760," So, let's make a small break and you guys have fun."
9000640,9002640," So, let's make a small break."
9002640,9003520," So, let's make a small break."

9141920,9143920," So, let's make small break."
9143920,9149600," So, let's make small break."
9149600,9167520," Hello, everyone."
9167520,9168560," Welcome back."
9168560,9169520," So, let's continue."
9171200,9174880," Yes, so, we can set the color of the particle."
9174880,9178240," And yes, where do we create new particles?"
9178240,9182800," I think the only place where we create new particles is in the burst particle."
9182800,9188000," And so, that means in the burst particle, we also have to accept the color, right?"
9188000,9190000," We create this new particle."
9190000,9191600," And let's provide the color here."
9193680,9195760," And so, when we burst this."
9195760,9197920," So, this is a bullet."
9197920,9200640," So, that means we use a particle color."
9200640,9203120," And I don't think particle color is needed now."
9203120,9206080," Because I could probably want to say explicitly anime color."
9206080,9207280," All right."
9207280,9211360," And here, I can explicitly say the player color."
9211360,9215840," What's up, fishy-puss."
9215840,9216560," Welcome to the stream."
9216560,9219040," So, anime color."
9219040,9220880," Do we use a particle color anywhere now?"
9220880,9223440," Yeah, we don't use it."
9223440,9224800," So, I don't think it's needed, right?"
9224800,9231200," Because the color of the particle will depend on how exactly we spawn them, right?"
9231200,9233200," So, there's no particle color per se."
9234480,9236240," There's just, you know, one of the colors."
9236240,9239360," It could be either color of the player or color of the enemy."
9239360,9250480," All righty."
9250480,9253040," So, let's see what's going to happen."
9253040,9255520," So, here's your idea, Anaboth."
9255520,9257760," I implemented your idea."
9257760,9260880," So, when I kill the enemy, it bursts these particles."
9260880,9263440," And now, it bursts the red ones."
9264240,9267760," I'm not sure how well it works."
9267760,9271280," Yeah, it kind of..."
9271280,9274160," Actually, let me see."
9274160,9280240," So, at the slow pace, at the slow pace, it's actually difficult."
9280240,9284480," Yeah, it's easy to evade them."
9284480,9286400," Avoid them."
9286400,9288640," Evade, maybe avoid."
9288640,9292000," But I want to get to the phase when they start spawning like crazy."
9292000,9294720," And just see if I can see how I get the damage."
9294720,9295920," Yeah."
9295920,9302640," So, I just want to see if this particular cue of indicating the damage is useful at all."
9302640,9304960," So, yeah."
9304960,9306720," So far, no damage."
9306720,9308240," So far, I didn't get any damage."
9309520,9310080," Uh..."
9310080,9310640," Oh, shit."
9310640,9312400," Okay, it's useful actually."
9312400,9315040," Like, I think it's indicating the damage really well."
9315040,9317200," Uh..."
9317200,9317440," Yeah."
9317440,9318640," I like that."
9318640,9320960," Oh, shit."
9320960,9321680," Fuck."
9321680,9323760," It's actually getting really fucking difficult."
9323760,9324080," Okay."
9324080,9330320," Fuck."
9330320,9332560," Fuck."
9332560,9334000," All right."
9334000,9339280," Fuck."
9339280,9339920," Oh, fuck."
9339920,9343440," Oh, I mean, at that point, I'm already dead."
9343440,9343760," Right."
9343760,9345200," So, uh..."
9345200,9345920," Essentially."
9345920,9355680," Uh..."
9355680,9356800," Burry taking the damage."
9356800,9357600," Okay."
9357600,9359360," All right."
9359360,9361440," So, that's pretty cool."
9361440,9364080," Uh..."
9364080,9364640," Nice."
9364640,9365440," I really like that."
9365440,9366560," So, I think it's working."
9366560,9368160," I do think it's working."
9368160,9369440," Um..."
9369440,9370080," So..."
9370080,9378400," By the way, I want to get to the stage when I have a lot of these things and they are spawning like crazy and I get damaged by them."
9378400,9379760," Uh..."
9379760,9379920," Yeah."
9379920,9381440," So, let's actually wait a little bit."
9381440,9381680," So..."
9381680,9384800," Uh..."
9384800,9385040," Yep."
9385040,9389360," You know what we can do?"
9389360,9395200," We can increase the health on every killed enemy."
9396560,9397840," I think that's kind of cool."
9397840,9406160," So, I just want to wait until they start spawning like crazy."
9406160,9409520," Yeah."
9409520,9410400," I think it's a good idea."
9410400,9415040," Basically, increase your health as you kill more of them."
9415040,9417680," Uh-huh."
9426560,9433520," It's so funny how they, like..."
9433520,9435680," How it gets super crazy."
9435680,9436960," Yeah."
9436960,9440720," I just want you to see how pose looks like."
9440720,9442640," Pose looks kind of great."
9442640,9443280," Uh..."
9443280,9443520," Yeah."
9443520,9445920," So, we pose it and it just..."
9445920,9446160," Yeah."
9446160,9449120," Yeah, that's cool."
9449120,9451040," Mmm..."
9451040,9457920," Hmm..."
9457920,9462080," Okay."
9462080,9462880," So..."
9462880,9465280," Um..."
9465280,9469120," We've killed our bros, prepared to die."
9469120,9470080," Shit."
9470080,9471680," Uh..."
9471680,9473440," Nice."
9474160,9474400," So..."
9474400,9475840," Yeah."
9475840,9479360," Now I need to introduce the state of the game, uh..."
9479360,9480240," When, uh..."
9480240,9487840," When you die, right?"
9487840,9489280," When you're dead, essentially."
9501120,9502000," So, I suppose..."
9502000,9505120," It should be pretty stiff for it."
9505120,9506080," Um..."
9506080,9509280," Hmm..."
9509280,9529920," What I'm thinking about..."
9531120,9535520," All right."
9535520,9536880," So..."
9536880,9538400," We damaged the player."
9538400,9538720," Right."
9538720,9539840," We damaged the player."
9539840,9542080," Mmm..."
9542080,9549680," And at some point, player will have zero health."
9549680,9550960," And we should start..."
9550960,9552640," Uh..."
9552640,9553920," Doing some interesting things."
9553920,9555760," For example..."
9555760,9557760," Uh..."
9557760,9558400," Okay."
9558400,9560800," If this is posed, we're gonna do that."
9561360,9561680," If..."
9561680,9562800," Uh..."
9562800,9564080," This player."
9564080,9565200," Health."
9565200,9566560," Uh..."
9566560,9568000," Is less or equal than zero."
9568000,9571440," We can do a very strange and interesting thing."
9571440,9573200," Um..."
9573200,9575440," We can slow down the time."
9575440,9580400," That's a very interesting idea."
9580400,9583040," And you're gonna see soon."
9583040,9584400," Why exactly I'm doing it like that?"
9586640,9587200," Uh..."
9587200,9589200," We can slow it in half."
9589200,9591360," So..."
9591360,9591680," Rate."
9591680,9594080," I wanna actually test this kind of stuff."
9594080,9595760," So, enemy spawn rate."
9595760,9596960," So, enemy spawn rate."
9596960,9598560," Enemy spawn cooldown."
9598560,9602720," And I'm gonna set it to 0, 0, like 1 at the beginning."
9602720,9604960," So, they start spawning like crazy right away."
9605520,9606960," And that's exactly what I wanna see."
9606960,9608160," Uh..."
9608160,9608560," Alright."
9608560,9609600," So..."
9609600,9615360," Uh..."
9615360,9619440," Okay."
9619440,9622880," So, I think the time should slow down more significantly."
9622880,9624640," Uh..."
9624640,9627680," Yeah."
9627680,9628160," I should..."
9628160,9629760," It should slow down even more significantly."
9629760,9630320," So, how much?"
9630320,9631360," Let's actually say 10."
9631360,9632720," Uh..."
9632720,9633440," I think 20."
9633440,9634880," 20 should be probably okay."
9634880,9636720," So, I want it..."
9636720,9638240," Basically, you die."
9638240,9639840," And you don't display the player."
9639840,9640800," And, uh..."
9640800,9644640," You have like bursts of your particles after your death."
9644640,9646400," And everything is just sort of freezes."
9646400,9647680," But not really freezes."
9647680,9648480," You know that effect."
9648480,9650640," But when the world froze."
9650640,9651440," But not really."
9651440,9653600," It still kind of keeps moving."
9653600,9654720," But slowly."
9654720,9655440," Right?"
9655440,9657440," It's like it goes to slow motion."
9657440,9658800," This is what I wanna achieve."
9658800,9660960," And I think it should be possible."
9660960,9661680," So, on top of that."
9661680,9662560," When I'm rendering."
9662560,9662960," Right?"
9662960,9664240," So, render the player."
9664240,9665920," Uh..."
9665920,9667440," So, class player."
9667440,9669520," Uh..."
9669520,9670000," Render."
9670000,9675200," Only if this health is greater than zero."
9675200,9679280," So, we're only rendering the player if the health of the player is greater than zero."
9679280,9680880," Uh..."
9680880,9681120," Yeah."
9681120,9681520," Bullet time."
9681520,9682640," I think it's called bullet time."
9682640,9684000," I'm not really good at terminology."
9684000,9684800," So, I'm really sorry."
9684800,9685680," Okay."
9685680,9688240," So, they're starting to do all of this shit."
9688240,9689360," And they're..."
9689360,9689920," Oh, shit."
9689920,9690640," That's so cool."
9690640,9692240," Look at that."
9692240,9696480," Well, I mean, they keep dying."
9696480,9697280," And everything."
9697280,9698000," But, uh..."
9698000,9698240," Yeah."
9698240,9700240," Mm."
9700240,9707040," That is so fucking cool."
9707040,9708480," I think it could be even slower."
9708480,9709360," If you think about it."
9709360,9710640," It could be even slower."
9711200,9711600," Uh..."
9711600,9712080," DT."
9712080,9713440," Uh..."
9713440,9714640," And then, uh..."
9714640,9715520," Maybe, like, 50."
9715520,9718080," Like, super hot."
9718080,9718320," Maybe."
9718320,9718880," I don't know."
9718880,9720880," I never played super hot, unfortunately."
9720880,9723600," Uh..."
9723600,9723920," Okay."
9723920,9726160," Yeah."
9728880,9731840," Um..."
9731840,9732480," So, yeah."
9732480,9736160," Cool."
9736160,9741280," It remembers me the intro of Brazilian TV show."
9741280,9742480," Hmm."
9742480,9744480," Is that a good Brazilian TV show?"
9749280,9751040," The intro of Brazilian TV show."
9751040,9758080," I haven't watched Russian TV for so long."
9758080,9759360," I don't even know what's going on there."
9759360,9761200," By the way, Russians..."
9761200,9761440," Do..."
9761440,9762080," Do..."
9762080,9764160," Does anyone watch Russian TV lately?"
9764960,9765680," Uh..."
9765680,9766400," I don't know."
9766400,9768160," Is it even worth watching these days?"
9768160,9770000," Um..."
9770000,9771360," All right."
9771360,9775120," Mm."
9775120,9775440," Okay."
9775440,9775840," That's cool."
9775840,9778160," Russian TV on Google."
9778160,9778640," Exactly."
9778640,9784240," So, I don't remember when was the last time I watched TV."
9784240,9793360," My mom and dad watch it 24/7."
9793360,9793840," Oh, yeah."
9793840,9796080," I mean, previous Russian generation still watch it."
9796080,9797040," It's not actually an intro."
9797040,9797840," It's an outro."
9797840,9799520," And I just know it because of memes."
9799520,9800080," Ah, I see."
9800080,9804480," Run TV and Aliens conspiracies are the best."
9804480,9807680," Yeah."
9807680,9808640," On Russian..."
9808640,9810480," Yeah."
9810480,9813120," In Russian TV, we have a specific channel"
9813120,9815440," dedicated to Aliens and conspiracies."
9815440,9816000," And..."
9816000,9816640," Holy shit."
9816640,9819040," It's so..."
9819040,9821440," And it's so bad."
9821440,9823200," It's so obviously, like, bad."
9823200,9829040," It's to the point that when you watch that channel,"
9829040,9831520," it feels like it's parodying itself."
9831520,9834080," Channel reached, you know,"
9834080,9838240," such a level of obnoxiousness about Aliens and conspiracies"
9838240,9840320," that it's basically parodying itself."
9840320,9840960," Like..."
9840960,9849520," Oh, yeah, I know."
9849520,9850640," I think I know that..."
9850640,9859280," Basically, imagine if Alex Jones were allowed to have a channel on, like, a federal TV."
9859280,9865440," If, like, a federal government actually funded Alex Jones and he was allowed to make, like, a channel."
9865440,9867120," That's what it feels like, actually."
9867120,9870000," Yes, it's exactly that."
9870000,9871360," It's literally like a..."
9871360,9871920," Oh, my God."
9871920,9873600," Holy shit."
9873600,9879120," Are Russian faking political news?"
9879120,9881760," Ah, well, I mean, what channels don't do that?"
9881760,9883680," In which country they don't do that?"
9883680,9886880," Also, what is faking?"
9886880,9890640," It's just, you know, looking at a different perspective."
9890640,9892880," Anyway, whatever."
9892880,9898800," Anyways."
9898800,9902480," What do we got?"
9902480,9904720," What was that?"
9904720,9905280," I don't remember."
9905280,9911280," Yes."
9911280,9915200," So, essentially, the problem is that the enemies keep dying to the player."
9916160,9918560," And if the enemy is not dead."
9918560,9923440," And, first of all, if the player's health is greater than zero."
9923440,9926080," Is greater than zero."
9926080,9928160," And the enemy is not dead."
9928160,9933600," Around 14 seconds."
9933600,9933920," Okay."
9933920,9940560," I hope it's not too loud."
9940560,9941760," Please don't be too loud."
9941760,9949360," just a second."
9949360,9950480," 14 seconds."
9950480,9951360," Okay."
9951360,9955200," Oh."
9955200,9959360," Oh, I can see that being memeable."
9959360,9959840," Yes."
9959840,9961200," I can see that being a meme."
9961200,9961600," Perfect."
9966480,9969120," It also goes like grayscale and shit."
9969120,9970080," Yeah."
9970080,9972720," You know what?"
9972720,9974720," Why can't we make it grayscale then?"
9974720,9976320," All right."
9976320,9977360," So, if you..."
9977360,9979680," So, this is a player."
9979680,9981760," That's actually gave me a great idea."
9981760,9984080," Why not the grayscale is in that shit?"
9985360,9985680," Thank you."
9985680,9985680," Thank you."
9985680,9986160," Thank you so much."
9986160,9987920," That's actually gave me an idea."
9987920,9992320," So, on top of slowing everything down, we can also apply a filter."
9992320,9994960," And we already have a mechanism for global filters."
9994960,9996320," Yes."
9996320,9997680," Yes."
9997680,9998000," Yes."
9998000,9998400," Yes."
9998400,9999120," That's perfect."
9999120,10000240," That's fucking perfect."
10000240,10005600," So..."
10005600,10009200," So, if it's gray only then..."
10009200,10012320," After a damage, by the way..."
10012320,10013200," After a damage..."
10013200,10014880," If the health..."
10014880,10020480," If the health becomes less or equal than zero..."
10020480,10022800," If the health becomes less or equal than zero..."
10022800,10029840," We need to set the global filter."
10029840,10030320," Okay."
10030320,10032560," Global filter."
10032560,10035440," And we set grayscale filter."
10035440,10035680," Right."
10035680,10037040," So, this is basically what we do here."
10037040,10038400," We set the grayscale filter."
10038400,10040240," All right."
10040240,10041200," So, what do we got?"
10041200,10042240," Oh, shit."
10042240,10043360," Oh, fuck."
10043360,10045280," I opened your link again because it's..."
10045280,10047600," I pressed Ctrl + Shift + Tab."
10047600,10049600," And my previous link was the Brazilian show."
10050480,10051440," Okay."
10051440,10052560," All right."
10052560,10054560," Okay."
10054560,10057360," So, they start spawning like crazy."
10057360,10058320," And then I die and..."
10058320,10068480," That's pretty cool."
10068480,10077600," Oh, I can still shoot."
10077600,10077920," Okay."
10077920,10079040," Cool."
10080480,10085120," So, now in a rendering..."
10085120,10088560," Classic, am I right?"
10088560,10095600," So, if posed that..."
10095600,10098080," Else if..."
10098080,10101520," Actually, what's more important?"
10101520,10101920," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
10101920,10104320," So, I think it should be else if..."
10104320,10105600," And this one should be else."
10105600,10108000," Else."
10108000,10114560," Else if this player health less or equal than zero."
10114560,10116480," We're saying..."
10122480,10123200," Sure-tired."
10123200,10123200," Sure-tired."
10123200,10124720," Okay."
10124720,10127840," Let me see."
10127840,10127840," Let me see."
10150160,10151520," Okay."
10151520,10151520," Okay."
10151520,10152880," So, and then you have to refresh."
10152880,10154960," If you want to..."
10154960,10156480," Continue doing this kind of shit."
10156480,10157120," And..."
10157120,10165440," Okay."
10165440,10167760," So, maybe we can..."
10167760,10169120," We can have something better."
10172880,10173280," Uh..."
10173280,10176080," F5 to restart."
10176080,10177760," Yes."
10177760,10180000," Blur."
10180000,10182160," Ah, it's difficult to apply the blur, unfortunately."
10182160,10184720," Or maybe it's not."
10184720,10188560," I need to think how to do that, but..."
10188560,10188880," Yeah."
10191840,10192640," Oh, by the way."
10192640,10195360," We can try to do an invert filter."
10195360,10196720," How about an invert filter?"
10196720,10198000," Does it have to be grayscale?"
10198000,10200240," Grayscale feels too, you know..."
10200240,10202960," Too much, maybe?"
10202960,10204880," Maybe not."
10204880,10205280," I don't know."
10205280,10210640," So, let's actually start with the original spawn cooldown."
10216880,10217920," JS shaders."
10217920,10218320," Yes."
10218320,10222400," Mm-hmm."
10222400,10235440," Mm-hmm."
10235440,10260880," I don't like the health bar."
10260880,10262800," I don't like the health bar."
10262800,10266160," I think the health bar takes too much space on the screen."
10266160,10281200," I think we need to indicate the health somehow differently."
10290240,10290560," Okay."
10290560,10295200," So..."
10295200,10300480," Okay."
10300480,10300800," LOL."
10300800,10302960," You died."
10302960,10306960," You died."
10306960,10308480," F5 to restart."
10308480,10308800," Okay."
10308800,10313440," And maybe also space to resume."
10313440,10314000," Like, I mean..."
10314000,10315840," Yeah, I didn't have to explain too much."
10315840,10316800," I don't know."
10316800,10320400," You died."
10320400,10323200," So, and also I want to do other things."
10323200,10323440," Like..."
10323440,10325920," And we keep spawning the enemies, by the way."
10325920,10327840," We keep spawning the enemies."
10327840,10328880," And you can also pose."
10328880,10330640," Uh..."
10330640,10331120," I think."
10331120,10334480," Uh..."
10334480,10335280," Key down."
10335280,10338880," You can still move, but it shouldn't affect anything."
10340880,10341520," Uh..."
10341520,10341600," Uh..."
10341600,10345200," So, mouse down..."
10345200,10345440," Okay."
10345440,10348880," If..."
10348880,10350880," This player..."
10350880,10351840," Health..."
10351840,10354640," Uh..."
10354640,10355520," Close down zero."
10355520,10357200," Return."
10357200,10360880," So, we don't handle any of this stuff if the player is there, then..."
10364080,10366320," What's funny is that you should be able to keep moving."
10366320,10368240," Eh..."
10368240,10368800," Not really."
10368800,10370480," Not really."
10370480,10375920," So, I think we can just skip everything if you're dead."
10375920,10376960," Like, you cannot pose."
10376960,10377840," You cannot do anything."
10377840,10378720," Like, you're dead."
10378720,10379200," That's it."
10379200,10381600," So, we keep rendering."
10381600,10383200," We keep updating."
10383200,10387040," But you cannot do anything."
10387040,10388560," You're dead, essentially."
10388560,10388960," All right."
10388960,10392080," Yeah."
10394080,10396800," Uh..."
10396800,10397680," Okay."
10397680,10399120," Let me ramp up the, uh..."
10399120,10402160," This thing."
10402160,10402560," Like this."
10402560,10407920," What's up, real reader?"
10407920,10408640," Welcome to the stream."
10408640,10409120," How are you doing?"
10409120,10410480," Haven't seen you in a while, by the way."
10410480,10413440," Okay."
10413440,10414320," So, I can't start."
10414320,10415440," I cannot move."
10415440,10416480," I cannot do anything."
10416480,10416720," Right?"
10416720,10418000," So, I cannot even pose."
10418000,10418640," It just says:"
10418640,10419280," ""You died."
10419280,10420320," F5 to restart."""
10420320,10421200," All right."
10421200,10422080," That's actually pretty cool."
10423440,10423760," Yeah."
10423760,10425920," That makes sense."
10425920,10430480," Cool."
10430480,10439440," Cool."
10439440,10440800," Nice."
10440800,10444800," And we're gonna change it to that."
10444800,10447520," So, do we have anything else?"
10451040,10451360," Okay."
10451360,10460320," Okay."
10460320,10463840," So, the only thing I'm unhappy with right now is the health bar."
10463840,10464080," Right?"
10464080,10465360," Health bar is kind of dumb."
10465360,10466000," I'm not gonna lie."
10466000,10470320," So, what could be a better indication of the health of the player?"
10470320,10475760," Maybe, maybe it could become more grayscale as..."
10475760,10480080," Or maybe everything could become more grayscale as you go."
10489440,10490880," I don't want to do shrinking, actually."
10490880,10496720," Oh, maybe."
10496720,10497120," I don't know."
10497120,10511280," So, the thing about shrinking is that it will make the game easier as you have less health."
10512720,10514800," But maybe that could be part of the mechanic."
10514800,10516480," That could be part of the mechanic."
10516480,10525600," Circle in a circle for health."
10533600,10536480," Well, if the inner circle is..."
10536480,10541600," If the outer circle is gray, maybe yes."
10541600,10543760," Okay."
10543760,10544880," Let me try to do that."
10544880,10546080," That's not a bad idea."
10546080,10547840," Let me think."
10551120,10552960," So, when I'm rendering, I'm filling the circle."
10552960,10553520," All right."
10553520,10554960," So, and..."
10554960,10556480," Oh, my God."
10556480,10558960," Let me revert this entire stuff."
10558960,10560320," Okay."
10560320,10570320," So, in radius, I'm gonna multiply the radius by essentially health divided by player max health."
10570320,10572240," All right."
10572240,10575680," So, this is gonna be the radius."
10575680,10579200," And the color is gonna be grayscaled."
10580080,10580400," All right."
10580400,10583120," I essentially take its color and I grayscale it."
10583120,10585360," And let's see how it's gonna go."
10585360,10590480," Why am I keep recompiling?"
10590480,10593360," I have a strange reflex to trying to recompile this thing."
10593360,10594720," All right."
10594720,10596000," So, let's see what's gonna happen."
10596000,10598480," Is it gonna ramp up super quick?"
10598480,10600000," No, it's not ramping up very quick."
10600000,10605120," Okay."
10605120,10607120," So, that didn't work for some reason, did I?"
10609120,10609760," Um..."
10609760,10616000," That literally didn't work."
10616000,10619120," Um..."
10619120,10624320," So..."
10624320,10626880," Excuse me?"
10626880,10628880," Is that because it was like an integer division?"
10628880,10632480," Is there something like integer division in, uh, in JavaScript?"
10632480,10634000," I don't think there is integer division."
10634000,10638400," I'm pretty sure there's no integer division."
10638400,10641760," Uh, okay."
10641760,10644960," What am I missing?"
10644960,10645760," What am I missing?"
10647760,10650080," I feel like I'm missing something very important."
10650080,10652880," So, if I do grayscale with this thing."
10652880,10654560," Um..."
10654560,10656560," Yeah, it works."
10656560,10659440," And maybe I have some errors in the console."
10661360,10662560," No, I didn't have anything."
10662560,10663920," Uh..."
10663920,10664480," That's very..."
10664480,10665680," Strange."
10665680,10674800," Because..."
10674800,10675680," Here is the health."
10675680,10678160," I divide it by maximum."
10678160,10679680," And I multiply by radius."
10680800,10681200," And..."
10681200,10682800," Okay."
10682800,10683200," So, if..."
10683200,10685120," What if I do something like this then?"
10685120,10688480," Oh, shit."
10697040,10697680," I..."
10697680,10698320," Wait a second."
10698320,10700000," I actually have to apply that to the..."
10700000,10701600," To the different one."
10701600,10702080," Yes, yes."
10702080,10702400," Okay."
10702400,10703840," So, I actually fucked up."
10703840,10706000," So..."
10706000,10706480," Yeah."
10706480,10707600," It has to be like this."
10707600,10709680," And that one shouldn't be..."
10709680,10713760," God damn it, Anubo."
10713760,10718880," I was about to comment on that, but I mean..."
10718880,10723280," Yes."
10723280,10726800," Like, now every time I press Ctrl + Shift + T, it opens that..."
10727040,10728320," Brazilian show thing."
10728320,10734720," You poisoned my cash."
10734720,10735760," You poisoned my cash."
10735760,10736000," Okay."
10736000,10736320," Anyway."
10736320,10739360," Alright."
10739360,10747200," Anyways."
10747200,10753280," Okay."
10753280,10754080," So..."
10754080,10756400," It looks like shit."
10757040,10757760," It looks like..."
10757760,10764480," Um..."
10764480,10767360," So..."
10767360,10768240," We can probably..."
10768240,10770960," Grayscale it somehow."
10770960,10773920," How can you..."
10773920,10777600," Make it more and more grayscale?"
10777600,10779200," Like a degree of grayscaleness."
10779200,10780720," You have to do HSL, right?"
10780720,10782800," You have to do HSL."
10785440,10794160," Don't draw the background one."
10794160,10794880," Uh..."
10794880,10798480," But that means it still will be colliding..."
10798480,10802080," It still will be colliding with the original thingy."
10802080,10806560," You still will be colliding with the original thingy."
10806560,10808320," So, that's kind of a nobuena."
10808320,10811520," I think."
10811520,10813360," Yeah."
10813360,10814160," It becomes smaller."
10814160,10814720," But the..."
10814720,10820800," The collisions is still not..."
10820800,10824560," But maybe it could become the game mechanic."
10824560,10825040," Why not?"
10825040,10825760," Right."
10825760,10830800," But the problem is that I need to refactor everything now."
10830800,10835200," I need to refactor."
10835200,10836640," Alpha is also gonna look like shit."
10836640,10838000," Trust me."
10839600,10840000," Um..."
10840000,10846480," Well, at least I feel like..."
10846480,10847680," Okay, let's try alpha."
10847680,10849440," But I think alpha is not gonna work."
10849440,10851760," I think alpha is gonna be kind of meh."
10851760,10856320," I think alpha is gonna be kind of meh."
10861040,10861680," I don't like it."
10861680,10862880," I don't like it."
10862880,10865280," So..."
10865280,10869040," What if we move the..."
10874640,10874880," Yeah."
10874880,10876480," So far..."
10876480,10879200," Modifying the radius..."
10879200,10881920," Sounds like a pretty interesting idea visually."
10881920,10884960," Visually, it's a pretty interesting idea."
10884960,10886240," Not gonna lie."
10886240,10888000," But..."
10888000,10889440," Mechanically..."
10889440,10891440," We need to now..."
10891440,10893280," You know..."
10893280,10893920," Update..."
10893920,10895440," Oh, yeah."
10895440,10898400," Um..."
10898400,10902400," Mm-hmm."
10904640,10911200," So, and that's dying."
10911200,10912320," And then boom."
10912320,10912880," And..."
10912880,10913600," Yeah."
10913600,10915040," So, basically..."
10915040,10916880," It becomes easier for you to play..."
10916880,10920000," As less health you have."
10920000,10920320," Right?"
10920320,10921840," It just becomes easier for you to play."
10921840,10923040," And at some point, it's just..."
10923040,10924960," It's just that."
10924960,10928240," So, maybe it doesn't display health at all."
10928240,10930560," So, the player can't know when he will die."
10930560,10931360," Maybe..."
10931360,10931680," Um..."
10934640,10937040," Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
10937040,10955680," Okay."
10955680,10956560," Uh..."
10956560,10960000," Let's explore the idea of shrinking the player."
10960720,10963520," So, the actual radius of the player..."
10963520,10965760," Is going to depend on..."
10965760,10968560," On its health."
10968560,10968960," Right?"
10968960,10970560," So, that means we're gonna have something like..."
10970560,10972320," Radius."
10972320,10974160," Radius function."
10974160,10976960," Which is going to take player..."
10976960,10979440," Player max radius."
10979440,10981520," And multiply it by..."
10981520,10981760," The..."
10981760,10983680," Health..."
10985120,10986720," Divided by player max health."
10986720,10989600," Player max health."
10989600,10991600," So, this is gonna be the radius that it's gonna give us."
10991600,10993280," And..."
10993280,10993520," Uh..."
10993520,10996400," Essentially, instead of this radius, we're gonna use this..."
10996400,10997920," Radius."
10997920,10999120," And we need to remove..."
10999120,11000080," Player..."
11000080,11001840," Radius."
11001840,11002560," Completely."
11002560,11004800," So, it's gonna become player max radius."
11004800,11005840," And..."
11005840,11006160," Uh..."
11006160,11008640," Everywhere where we use player radius."
11008640,11009040," Right?"
11009040,11010080," So, enemy radius."
11010080,11011040," Well..."
11011040,11012560," Yeah."
11012560,11014480," Player max radius."
11014480,11016080," Uh..."
11016080,11016560," Player..."
11016560,11018400," Radius."
11018400,11019200," Okay."
11019200,11019840," So, here..."
11019840,11021200," Um..."
11021200,11024400," I just have to use this radius."
11024400,11026400," Uh..."
11026400,11027440," Player radius."
11027440,11029280," So, this is a game."
11029280,11031440," Um..."
11031440,11032560," This is initial position."
11032560,11034960," It's actually player max radius."
11034960,11036560," Then player..."
11036560,11038400," Radius."
11038400,11041200," So, this one is gonna be this player..."
11041200,11042640," Uh..."
11042640,11043280," Radius."
11043280,11043760," Like this."
11043760,11046480," Another one player radius."
11046480,11048240," And I think that's it, actually."
11048240,11049520," Believe it or not."
11049520,11050800," I think that is it."
11050800,11052320," That should be it."
11052320,11054400," All right."
11054400,11055040," And..."
11055040,11056000," I broke something."
11056000,11056640," What the fuck?"
11056640,11059120," Uh..."
11059120,11061040," Player radius."
11062240,11063280," So, shoot at..."
11063280,11063920," Shoot at..."
11063920,11065200," Uh..."
11065200,11070560," Yeah."
11070560,11071680," I see what I did here."
11071680,11072240," Uh..."
11072240,11073920," Okay."
11073920,11076960," That's pretty cool."
11076960,11080000," Uh-huh."
11080000,11080720," Uh-huh."
11080720,11081360," Now..."
11081360,11082400," Yeah."
11082400,11083360," So, basically..."
11083360,11085520," You become smaller."
11085520,11087520," And it becomes easier for you to actually..."
11087520,11089440," Uh..."
11089440,11090000," Escape."
11090000,11091680," And it becomes..."
11091680,11092240," Oh my god."
11092240,11094720," It becomes actually difficult to see where you are."
11094720,11096320," I didn't like that."
11096320,11097600," No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
11097600,11098880," That's a bad idea."
11098880,11100800," No, no, no, no, no, no."
11100800,11102880," It becomes difficult to see where you are."
11103760,11104160," Really?"
11104160,11111440," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
11111440,11114160," No."
11114160,11115600," Yeah."
11115600,11122800," So, we have to do something..."
11122800,11123520," Something else."
11123520,11128000," One of the solutions would be probably..."
11128000,11130400," Maybe make it more and more grayscale."
11133760,11138640," Okay."
11138640,11140560," So, I think I have a better solution right now."
11140560,11145440," Class."
11145440,11150240," So, first of all, health bar is going to be very thin."
11150240,11151040," Like around 10."
11151040,11155200," And in the place where we do that, we're going to draw that not here."
11155200,11156800," So, here's the x."
11156800,11157680," X is okay."
11157680,11159920," Y is going to be essentially height."
11161600,11165680," Minus health bar height."
11165680,11168480," All right."
11168480,11171440," Okay."
11171440,11172400," So, it's going to be down below."
11172400,11173920," I think it's better."
11173920,11179200," I like it better."
11185680,11186560," Oh, shit."
11186560,11195680," Okay."
11195680,11197200," So, I probably need to just die now."
11197200,11205680," Okay."
11205680,11207040," Here's an idea."
11207600,11214480," What if we start making everything increasingly more grayscale?"
11214480,11223120," Maybe a small bar at the top left and the huge bar that's the whole screen."
11223120,11229600," Ideally, I don't want to have any HUD at all."
11230640,11232720," Because HUD is kind of like distracting."
11232720,11234640," Let's actually make everything slow."
11234640,11237120," Well, I mean, what about people with colorblindness then?"
11237120,11239200," I don't know."
11239200,11246320," So, that'll be kind of interesting."
11246320,11250880," That's already an HUD."
11251440,11252400," Well, yeah, probably."
11273840,11285840," Okay, let me try the idea of grayscaling everything slowly as we go down."
11285840,11286960," Right."
11286960,11288720," So, we have a global filter."
11288720,11289600," Global filter."
11289600,11294560," And maybe we're going to have additional global filter."
11294560,11297600," Something like this."
11299840,11303760," Let's global grayness."
11303760,11304240," All right."
11304240,11310560," And then we're going to have a function global grayness filter."
11310560,11314640," Global grayness filter that accepts the color."
11314640,11317040," That accepts the color."
11317040,11320320," And takes the grayscale width."
11320320,11324720," And unfortunately, in RGB, how can you do the grayscale like gradually?"
11324720,11326160," How can you do it gradually?"
11326720,11333120," So, essentially, in case of a grayscale, in case of a grayscale, the one that we are computing."
11333120,11335440," So, we have a grayscale method in here."
11335440,11340080," So, we take an average of X and we actually slowly bringing it there."
11340080,11342400," We're slowly bringing it there."
11342400,11343600," So, here's the idea."
11343600,11350960," What if we had like some sort of like a T parameter, which is initially like 1."
11351520,11359200," And essentially, you basically lerp between R and X, right?"
11359200,11364960," So, if you had lerp, you would do this R, X and T."
11364960,11366320," You see what I mean?"
11366320,11375440," So, essentially, we take an average between RGB and we're bringing them into their average."
11375440,11383600," But then, we introduce a parameter that lets us actually control how closer you go to that average thing."
11383600,11386800," So, and because of that, you can even animate grayness."
11386800,11390720," And I know that it's not correct in terms of like HSL and whatnot."
11390720,11392400," And this is because I don't want to deal with that."
11392960,11397360," So, I want to do something like that."
11397360,11402160," And then, another lerp is from B, X to T."
11402160,11403680," And there we go."
11403680,11408000," So, this is basically what we can have here if we have lerp, right?"
11408000,11408880," Wait, wait a second."
11408880,11409440," JavaScript."
11409440,11410800," Does JavaScript even have lerp?"
11410800,11413120," JavaScript lerp."
11413120,11416240," No, it doesn't."
11416240,11416480," Okay."
11416480,11422080," lerp A and B and T."
11422080,11422400," Right."
11422400,11427280," So, and essentially, what we do here, we have B minus A multiplied by T."
11427280,11430320," And then, we can have A plus this entire shit."
11430320,11430560," Cool."
11430560,11433200," This Inur."
11433200,11434560," This Inur Osama."
11434560,11434960," Hello."
11434960,11438160," Global grayness."
11438160,11439600," Global games."
11439600,11441520," Nice."
11441520,11447840," And it's going to be zero initially, right?"
11447840,11449520," So, that means we're going to do color."
11449520,11452720," Grayscale."
11452720,11454880," Global grayness."
11454880,11458320," Cool."
11460480,11462160," Uh, two, two, two, two."
11462160,11464320," Supinic?"
11464320,11465600," Is Supinic here?"
11465600,11466160," What the fuck?"
11466160,11470720," All right."
11470720,11473280," So, now, every time we filter everything, we apply..."
11473280,11478720," I think first we need to apply the global grayness filter and then global filter at all."
11480800,11481600," Wait a second."
11481600,11489280," Technically, we're not using anything but the global grayness."
11489280,11495280," Let's get rid of all of that shit."
11497680,11500800," Uh, let's get rid of all of that shit."
11500800,11502160," I think that's going to be epic."
11502160,11504080," I'm going to explain you why soon."
11504080,11507680," So, essentially, yes."
11507680,11510560," Live only the global grayness."
11510560,11515200," Uh, and it's going to be gray."
11515200,11517440," Scale."
11517440,11523040," Um, grayscale global grays, uh, grayness."
11523040,11523360," Yeah."
11523360,11529440," So, grayscale global..."
11529440,11534720," This one is interesting."
11534720,11537200," Okay."
11537200,11541040," Global filter."
11541040,11542480," Okay."
11542480,11548640," So, every time we're rendering something, every time we're rendering something,"
11548640,11551600," we should recompute the global grayness to..."
11553840,11555600," According to the health of the player."
11555600,11558240," So, we don't need to do that anymore."
11558240,11559520," We don't need to do that anymore."
11559520,11561200," And in here..."
11561200,11562400," Right."
11562400,11569440," If this is posed, global grayness is one."
11569440,11573440," Otherwise, global grayness is..."
11573440,11575680," Player."
11575680,11576480," This player."
11576480,11581680," Uh, health divided by player max health."
11583040,11584240," Player max health."
11584240,11587840," Uh, and that should be it."
11587840,11592240," Uh, we don't even need that shit in here."
11592240,11594400," Filter."
11594400,11596720," Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool."
11596720,11599600," Uh, all right."
11599600,11604480," Chromium."
11607120,11607600," Uh-huh."
11607600,11609520," So, that..."
11609520,11611600," Something went wrong."
11611600,11613360," Okay."
11613360,11614880," So, let me see where I made a mistake."
11614880,11616800," So, grayscale."
11616800,11618000," Initially, it's one."
11618000,11622240," But it has to be zero, right?"
11622240,11623120," If it's zero,"
11623120,11627680," we should be at this part."
11627680,11628880," We should be at this part."
11628880,11631440," So, it should be RGB or whatnot."
11631440,11634480," Uh, global grayness."
11634480,11636080," So, this is a grayscale."
11636080,11636480," How..."
11636480,11636640," Where..."
11636640,11637920," How do we use a grayscale now?"
11637920,11642720," Pose."
11642720,11646400," Ah!"
11646400,11647280," We have to invert it."
11647280,11648640," Shit."
11648640,11650560," We have to invert it with this."
11650560,11652320," So, we have to take the health."
11652320,11653200," Since it's gonna be one."
11653200,11655280," So, the global grays has to be zero in this case."
11655280,11656240," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
11656240,11657200," I see, I see, I see."
11657200,11659520," So, did I save everything?"
11659520,11660800," I think I saved everything."
11660800,11661280," All right."
11661280,11663280," So, I can now pause everything."
11663280,11664720," Everything's okay."
11664720,11665840," And hit me."
11665840,11667760," Hit me with your best thing."
11667760,11670160," Uh, yes."
11670160,11670640," Look at that."
11681760,11682560," So, to be fair."
11682560,11686480," Because of that."
11686480,11690480," The color of the player should be more contrasting."
11690480,11692240," Than the color of the enemies."
11692240,11694800," So, this is a way better way of doing that."
11694800,11695440," In my opinion."
11695440,11696960," So, health bar."
11696960,11699840," Uh, so, health bar height."
11699840,11702400," Health bar height."
11702400,11703360," We don't need to do that."
11703360,11705920," Health bar."
11705920,11706160," Yeah."
11706160,11707840," So, we don't have a health bar anymore."
11707840,11710080," So, what we have instead."
11710080,11714720," We have a slow grayness increasing over time."
11714720,11715520," Right."
11715520,11718480," And here's the problem."
11718480,11720800," Like, the contrast between the player color."
11720800,11723120," Is actually too small."
11723120,11724880," Uh."
11724880,11726240," Yeah."
11726240,11728240," It's actually too small in my opinion."
11728240,11729440," Right."
11735280,11735600," Okay."
11735600,11737840," And now the ultimate, uh, ultimate shit."
11737840,11739760," So, health."
11739760,11741680," We should heal the player."
11741680,11746800," Every time, uh, it kill, uh, it kills the, uh, enemy."
11746800,11747520," Right."
11747520,11749680," So, player damage."
11749680,11751840," But in here, we have to do this player."
11751840,11753040," Heal."
11753040,11754560," Uh."
11754560,11754880," Kill."
11754880,11755840," Heal."
11755840,11756640," Right."
11757360,11759440," So, and let's go to the class player."
11759440,11762160," So, we have a damage and we have a heal."
11762160,11764560," Uh, which is kind of interesting."
11764560,11768960," Uh, value."
11768960,11772640," Uh, and it's going to be actually plus that value."
11772640,11778640," But you cannot go further than, uh, player max."
11780080,11780880," Uh, health."
11780880,11781760," Player max health."
11781760,11784160," And, uh, kill heal."
11784160,11785840," Uh, const."
11785840,11787040," Where is the constants?"
11787040,11791520," Um, so."
11791520,11794640," Maybe it should be called, uh, enemy kill heal."
11794640,11798560," So, const enemy kill heal."
11798560,11805360," So, essentially, you need five, uh, times get touched by the enemy."
11805360,11808400," But you need ten kills to compensate for that."
11808400,11809600," Let's actually put it this way."
11810800,11812080," Uh, let's actually put it this way."
11812080,11814320," So, where is the kill heal?"
11814320,11816320," Uh, where do we use it?"
11816320,11820160," Uh, any kill heal."
11820160,11822400," All right."
11822400,11823520," There we go."
11823520,11825040," So, what we're going to have here."
11825040,11829360," So, and maybe because of that, I don't have to modify the color over time."
11829360,11831120," So, uh."
11831120,11833360," Oh, yeah, max."
11833360,11835440," Oh, yeah, it actually increases."
11835440,11836080," Oh, shit."
11836080,11838160," You can actually make it more saturated that way."
11838160,11839200," That's actually pretty cool."
11839760,11840880," Uh, heal."
11840880,11842080," Uh, where is the heal?"
11842080,11843520," Here is the heal."
11843520,11845760," And, uh, it has to be minimum."
11845760,11846800," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
11846800,11847920," So, it has to be minimum."
11847920,11848960," Uh."
11848960,11850960," So, come on."
11850960,11851520," Hit me."
11851520,11852480," Hit me with something."
11852480,11853600," All right."
11854240,11855600," So, uh, yeah."
11855600,11859440," Let's actually try to die and then I can keep killing them."
11859440,11862160," And this will recover my health, right?"
11862160,11864000," The more you kill them, the more it recovers your health."
11864000,11867760," But then, uh, at some point you, you will die essentially."
11867760,11871920," At some point you will essentially die."
11871920,11879680," So, uh, we can keep playing like, like that."
11879680,11881520," Oh, shit."
11881520,11882000," Oh, shit."
11882000,11882400," Oh, fuck."
11883520,11884080," All right."
11884080,11889520," So, uh, it's not very colorblind friendly."
11889520,11891840," But, um, yeah."
11896640,11899840," Maybe we can change the, uh, the main colors of the."
11899840,11902880," Oh, shit."
11902880,11903520," That's actually."
11903520,11904080," Oh, fuck."
11904080,11904400," Oh, fuck."
11904400,11904720," Oh, fuck."
11904720,11908080," That was really weird."
11908080,11910400," So, it started to kind of disappear."
11910400,11911200," I don't know why."
11911200,11912480," Um."
11912480,11915440," Well, yeah."
11915440,11916640," So, that was interesting."
11916640,11918480," Um."
11918480,11920800," You dead now, sir."
11920800,11921120," Yes."
11921120,11929680," So, at the closer to the end."
11929680,11935280," I don't know what it was, but it started like blinking or something."
11935280,11937840," Uh, I don't know what exactly happened there."
11937840,11938880," Okay."
11938880,11945120," So, now I'm finally more or less happy with, uh, all, uh, with the health mechanics."
11945120,11946080," And death mechanics."
11946080,11947120," Yes."
11947120,11949280," I think this is exactly what I want to see here."
11949280,11951040," Uh, yes."
11951040,11951680," That's perfect."
11951680,11953360," Um."
11953360,11957920," So, and I especially like this last wave."
11957920,11961280," Uh, that essentially, like, the culmination of the game."
11961280,11962480," Like, you should stop playing."
11962480,11963200," Just, yeah."
11963200,11964160," Uh."
11975120,11975520," Uh."
11975520,11979920," Oh, fuck."
11979920,11989520," So, it's actually super easy to get lost in the."
11995760,11996160," Okay."
11996160,12002640," So, that's pretty cool."
12002640,12019920," And, uh, the effect of slowing down of the bullet times becomes even more epic."
12020240,12024960," Uh, because when you're dying, like, there will be probably a lot of particles."
12024960,12025200," Right."
12025200,12027040," There will be probably a lot of particles."
12027040,12029360," And they're all in the bullet time is going to look very epic."
12031680,12032160," Um."
12032160,12033760," Okay."
12033760,12035200," So, yeah."
12035200,12036160," That's pretty cool."
12036160,12036880," That's pretty cool."
12036880,12038560," And then you can refresh and start over."
12038560,12040400," WSD to move."
12040400,12041520," Uh, you move around."
12041520,12042400," Uh, lift clip."
12042400,12043040," Blah, blah, blah."
12044160,12044480," Uh."
12044480,12048240," What's up, beamstream official?"
12048240,12050400," Uh, hello, hello."
12050400,12054640," So, let me, let me take a look at how I'm gonna die one more time."
12054640,12056640," So, I really like that."
12056640,12060480," And then we're gonna claim this issue done."
12060480,12062720," Uh, hopefully."
12062720,12065840," No, we just need loot boxes."
12065840,12066320," Yeah, sure."
12066320,12069920," Uh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep."
12070720,12076800," I wonder if one, at some point, uh, I'm gonna slip to the chat and accidentally ban somebody."
12076800,12078560," That would be actually pretty, pretty funny."
12078560,12078880," I think."
12078880,12083680," Ah!"
12083680,12090720," Mm-hmm."
12090720,12097760," Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
12100720,12104320," Okay, cool."
12104320,12110800," Uh, sometimes it just, like, slips through or something, but, uh, I guess it's okay."
12110800,12112560," All righty."
12112560,12114320," Mm-hmm."
12114320,12115680," Accident, yeah, exactly."
12115680,12117680," Uh, all right."
12117680,12119360," So, what did we do here?"
12119360,12120640," So, we did a specific to-do."
12120640,12122000," No way for player to die."
12122000,12122240," Okay."
12122240,12125040," So, now there is a way for player to die."
12125040,12130240," So, the next issue is gonna be killing enemies does not, uh, give any points."
12130240,12131520," And that should be relatively easy."
12131520,12135040," So, the only problem is that we will need to display the points somehow."
12135040,12139280," And I guess, uh, that's kind of difficult to do without any HUD."
12139280,12140240," All right."
12140240,12143840," So, we'll have to introduce something like score and just render that."
12143840,12145920," Uh, anyway."
12145920,12147680," So, let's first do the following thing."
12147680,12150000," Uh, okay."
12150000,12151040," How are we gonna say that?"
12151040,12156080," Um, introduce death mechanics."
12156800,12159440," And that closes issue number five."
12160320,12162080," And we're gonna push that right into the repo."
12162080,12165040," And you can play this game here."
12165040,12166800," You can find the source code in the GitHub."
12166800,12172960," And then, in a couple of minutes, the, uh, latest version should be deployed at sodium.org/dzdzwe."
12172960,12176160," Uh, it's not the latest version yet, um, as far as I know."
12176160,12177680," But soon it should be the latest one."
12177680,12179040," So, we should be able to play yourself."
12179040,12182880," Uh, on the space core when the player dies."
12182880,12183760," Uh, maybe."
12183760,12186240," Uh, yeah."
12186240,12187600," Maybe it's a good idea, actually."
12188480,12192960," Because you're not gonna be, like, following your score while you're playing."
12192960,12194560," You, you wanna focus on, actually."
12194560,12200080," But maybe it's kinda nice to know the score, um, while you're playing."
12200080,12202000," Yeah."
12202000,12204480," Anyway."
12204480,12206400," So, let's start working on the score."
12206400,12209200," Uh, so, let's go here."
12209200,12212640," And let's just introduce score."
12212640,12213360," It's gonna be zero."
12214080,12215520," It's pretty straightforward."
12215520,12217840," Now, every time, uh, you die."
12217840,12220240," Uh, every time you kill."
12220240,12222400," So, you get healed."
12222400,12225360," And you also get a particular amount of points."
12225360,12226400," So, how many do you get?"
12226400,12231120," Uh, enemy, uh, kill score."
12231120,12231840," Right."
12231840,12233360," So, this is what we're gonna have here."
12233360,12235040," Uh, right."
12235040,12236000," So, enemy."
12236000,12239920," Uh, so, how many of, uh, of the points we're gonna give?"
12239920,12241360," Uh, I guess."
12241360,12242080," It just depends."
12242080,12243760," We can give, like, 100 points."
12243760,12244640," Why not?"
12244640,12245360," It's just something."
12245360,12247200," Uh, leaderboard."
12247200,12248640," I'm not sure about leaderboard."
12248640,12250560," We'll see."
12250560,12250960," We'll see."
12250960,12259360," Right button only works when I use capital D."
12259360,12260160," What right button?"
12260160,12261520," We don't even handle right button."
12261520,12263280," Uh, right."
12263280,12269840," So, okay."
12270560,12272000," I want to make a cup of tea chat."
12272000,12277680," Yes, you can make a play field view."
12277680,12281440," Um."
12281440,12286960," Okay."
12286960,12289280," Ooh."
12289280,12291200," This is hard."
12291200,12292160," Okay."
12292160,12294000," So, yeah."
12297520,12298960," Yeah, you can actually zoom out."
12298960,12303840," And, by the way, on, yeah, for me, it becomes extremely slow if I zoom out."
12303840,12307360," So, this is something for me to take into account."
12307360,12312320," Uh, so, what I'm thinking, actually."
12312320,12314320," So, yeah, yeah."
12314320,12318080," We, we keep, uh, you know, adding to the score."
12318080,12318720," Uh."
12318720,12318720," Uh."
12318720,12323520," You died."
12323520,12325040," Score."
12325040,12326880," Uh."
12326880,12330000," This score."
12330000,12332800," Your score."
12332800,12335040," Uh."
12335040,12336160," This is not how we do that."
12336160,12337120," Yeah."
12337120,12337680," I remember."
12337680,12339360," I know how to JavaScript."
12339360,12340240," Trust me, chat."
12341440,12342000," Trust me."
12342000,12346240," I have no F5 on my Mac."
12346240,12348480," But, yet, you understood what I mean."
12348480,12350160," Right."
12350160,12351760," So."
12369760,12370240," Okay."
12370240,12372160," So, let's actually try to play it as usual."
12398800,12421360," I think it's kind of a bad idea to hide that from the player."
12421360,12422880," Like, hide the score from the player."
12422880,12425680," Way the f**k."
12425680,12427120," What the, what the hell happened?"
12428400,12431520," Uh, why they don't die anymore?"
12431520,12433840," What did they break?"
12433840,12437120," Wait a f**king second."
12437120,12445600," When did they break something?"
12445600,12448080," Oh, I'm playing."
12451200,12453440," I'm playing the version on Sodium.org."
12453440,12454160," Uh."
12454160,12456720," Which was not properly redeployed yet, apparently."
12456720,12459360," And I'm thinking, what, am I going crazy?"
12459360,12460480," Yes, I am going crazy."
12460480,12461360," Okay."
12461360,12462720," So, this is the latest version."
12462720,12464080," All right."
12464080,12466480," So, uh, let me open this in the Chromium."
12466480,12467040," Oh my god."
12467040,12467760," I'm so tired."
12467760,12469920," But I still haven't finished everything."
12469920,12471520," I wanted to finish this game today."
12472160,12473920," Uh, but apparently there's still too much."
12473920,12474880," Okay, so, perfect."
12474880,12475920," Uh, it already broke."
12475920,12479040," Uh, game update."
12479040,12480320," Where it broke and why."
12480320,12481920," Because we don't have score."
12481920,12482800," So, what did it say?"
12482800,12485040," Uh, unquote, reference score is not defined."
12485040,12486320," Yeah, because I have to do this."
12487600,12490480," Uh, score plus."
12490480,12492400," Yeah, it has to be this."
12492400,12495040," Uh-huh."
12495040,12496960," Okay."
12496960,12504080," And above."
12504080,12506560," Do you see this?"
12506560,12508000," Do you see this?"
12508000,12510960," Is that, like, the hugest meme in Brazil?"
12510960,12511440," Like, is..."
12514800,12515440," I think..."
12515440,12517680," I think we found the Brazilian detector."
12517680,12518000," Yes."
12518000,12520480," We found the Brazilian detector."
12520480,12524400," You are the second Brazilian who actually points that out."
12524400,12525440," That's very interesting."
12525440,12530880," All right."
12530880,12533200," That's very interesting."
12533200,12541600," Making three Brazilians."
12541600,12542560," Okay, so, yeah."
12542560,12543680," Nice."
12545760,12546960," Brazilians everywhere."
12546960,12547280," Yeah."
12547280,12551120," Cool."
12551120,12555280," Game detector."
12555280,12568800," So, I just want to see the score, I think."
12568800,12572240," I just want to play as usual and get as much of the score as possible."
12574000,12574560," Uh-huh."
12574560,12585360," Not bad."
12585360,12586320," Not bad at all."
12586320,12587760," Your score."
12587760,12589760," Hmm."
12599760,12600320," Cool."
12600320,12600560," Hmm."
12600560,12600560," Hmm."
12600560,12601520," Hmm."
12601520,12604240," Binary score."
12604240,12605040," Yes, exactly."
12605040,12606000," It's a binary score."
12606000,12609120," Now we need to get a non-binary score."
12609120,12609840," How about that?"
12611920,12613840," The score should scale with difficulty, probably."
12613840,12619680," Okay, so I think I'm fine with that solution."
12619680,12621520," All right."
12621520,12624400," I'm fine with that solution."
12624400,12626480," So, what we're gonna do here is..."
12626480,12629440," I just claim it is done."
12629440,12635440," So, maybe I'm gonna, like, change the score in the future."
12640640,12641280," Oh, shit."
12641280,12641280," Oh, shit."
12641280,12641920," Fuck."
12641920,12643440," So, I need to..."
12643440,12647200," I definitely need to make a small break because I'm already, like, losing the focus."
12647200,12650320," All right."
12650320,12651040," Uh..."
12651040,12652160," Introduce..."
12652160,12652560," Uh..."
12652560,12653040," Score."
12653040,12654880," Uh..."
12654880,12656080," Introduce score."
12656080,12656560," And..."
12656560,12658080," Close."
12658080,12659840," Six."
12660880,12662480," Let's push that right into the repo."
12662480,12668720," All right."
12668720,12670880," Uh..."
12670880,12672560," Spawning rate ramps up too quickly."
12672560,12676720," Sometimes I'm anywhere spawned outside of the game, but you can easily get lost outside of the screen."
12676720,12678080," Uh..."
12678080,12679040," Explosion attack."
12679040,12683200," I was thinking about some sort of explosion attack, but I'm not sure if I want to implement it right now."
12683200,12685040," I think it's kind of outside of the scope."
12685040,12686560," Uh..."
12686560,12689120," Yeah, I'm gonna just move it away."
12689120,12690160," Uh..."
12690880,12692720," From this thing."
12692720,12693520," It's kind of, like, a..."
12693520,12694880," Nice to have."
12694880,12696320," Um..."
12696320,12703200," You can do something simple, like score spawn rate, maybe."
12703200,12708720," Uh..."
12708720,12709760," So, yeah."
12709760,12715920," I really want to make a break because I'm losing focus, so I'm gonna just start making tea."
12715920,12719200," Does anyone have any questions while I'm making a cup of tea?"
12719200,12719520," Maybe."
12719520,12730560," What tea?"
12730560,12731440," It's just a regular tea."
12731440,12733840," Regular black tea."
12735520,12736160," Mm..."
12736160,12736160," Mm-hmm."
12736160,12736160," Mm-hmm."
12736160,12753360," Does anyone have any questions?"
12753360,12762320," While I'm making a cup of tea?"
12762320,12762720," Uh..."
12762720,12764720," While I'm making a cup of tea?"
12764720,12777680," Oh, yeah, by the way, the game is completely unfinished and it may not work in other browsers."
12777680,12780960," So, so far I'm making sure it works on my machine."
12782000,12782960," Multiplayer when?"
12782960,12790800," Uh, probably not in this game because I plan to finish this game, like, in two days."
12790800,12793120," So, basically I'm game jamming this entire game."
12793120,12799600," I'm cutting down a lot of features, actually."
12799600,12800320," So..."
12807440,12812640," Which language would you recommend to a programmer trying to get more into functional programming,"
12812640,12814800," especially concepts like monads?"
12814800,12817760," PHP."
12817760,12819680," I think PHP is great for learning monads."
12820240,12823760," So, I personally learned monads by using PHP every day."
12823760,12828640," So, if you use PHP every day, three times per day, before the meal,"
12828640,12831280," the monads will come to you."
12831280,12833280," Yes."
12833280,12834640," All right."
12834640,12837120," So, I'm gonna quickly go and make a small break."
12837120,12838800," I think, like, three minutes or so."
12838800,12840000," A small..."
12840000,12841760," Let's actually make this thing."
12841760,12843600," Three minutes."
12848800,12851120," Okay, but if you want serious answer..."
12851120,12857040," Knowing monads doesn't really make you a better programmer."
12857040,12863360," And people who disagree with that..."
12863360,12870560," They're just trying to cope with the fact that they wasted a lot of time learning all that bullshit."
12870560,12874000," Okay."
12874000,12875680," Anyway."
12875680,12877040," So, let's make a small break."
12877040,12877760," And you guys have fun?"
12878800,12908780," Thank you."
12908800,12938780," Thank you."
12938800,12968780," Thank you."
12968800,12998780," Thank you."
12998800,13028780," Thank you."
13028800,13058780," Thank you."
13058780,13060820," I'm not quite sure."
13060820,13063240," Why didn't I refresh that?"
13063240,13065580," Explosion."
13065580,13068120," I unassigned it, didn't I?"
13068120,13072360," I specifically unassigned it and it didn't work."
13073220,13103200," So, I think the most interesting part in here, player can..."
13103200,13115400," easily get lost outside of the screen and I want to address that."
13115400,13118780," So, I want to introduce the notion of a camera that follows the player."
13118780,13123320," I think that will be actually kind of cool."
13123320,13128280," And maybe we're going to implement a similar camera we implemented for something, right?"
13128280,13132500," Where the camera actually follows you, right?"
13132500,13133980," Around and whatnot."
13134980,13152620," So, I think that will move all of these functions like feel text, feel message, feel circle, feel rect, into the camera and I can move the filters into the camera, right?"
13152620,13167660," And basically, by modifying the position of the camera, I'll automatically will modify the positions of the positions of the objects that I'm doing."
13167660,13169660," So, I can automatically do all the translations. Okay, I want to address this thing."
13169660,13177420," So, essentially, you're going to be moving in an infinite world and you're going to have a camera that slowly follows you, right?"
13177420,13180000," So, we're going to have something like that. I think it's going to be pretty cool."
13181440,13188540," Yeah, I need to go to the kitchen and just pour myself some hot water."
13211440,13235600," All right. So, nice, so, nice, so, nice, so, nice, so, we're going to introduce a camera and the game is going to look majestic, absolutely freaking majestic."
13240400,13269960," So, so, now that you are embracing Zoomer technology,"
13269960,13273720," Vulcan Stream 1, how JavaScript is a Zoomer technology? I don't understand."
13273720,13276040," It's all as fuck."
13276040,13279320," It came out when I was five years old."
13279320,13282520," Seriously, how is that, how is that Zoomer?"
13282520,13286520," All right."
13286520,13290680," And speaking of Vulcan, right, speaking of Vulcan."
13290680,13293240," Oh, if Zoomer is using it, I see."
13293240,13297640," Speaking of Vulcan, Vulcan doesn't work on my laptop."
13299520,13303120," I try to set up Vulcan, it just doesn't work."
13303120,13306560," I'm sorry."
13308880,13317760," I wish at some point I can find motivation to start building up a good streaming environment with, like, good hardware."
13319280,13322320," So, I can, like, do some interesting things."
13322320,13326480," For example, I wanted to try to program mesh shaders unironically."
13327760,13328320," Seriously."
13328320,13328400," Seriously."
13328400,13333360," But, unfortunately, I'm just too depressed to do anything about that."
13333360,13336640," So, yeah, I'm really sorry."
13336640,13338640," I cannot do anything."
13338640,13343360," So, essentially, like, I'm following the path of the least resistance right now."
13343360,13348960," So, I have my setup and I cannot force myself to do anything to improve it."
13348960,13350160," At least at this point."
13350160,13353680," I wish I could, but I just cannot do that."
13353680,13360800," I try to start into Vulcan sometimes, but the fact that you have to install the SDK always makes me drop the ID instantly."
13360800,13363520," I don't even know what you need to do for the Vulcan."
13363520,13365040," And, yeah."
13365040,13368240," So, yeah."
13368240,13369120," Anyways."
13369120,13371360," Let's continue."
13371360,13373200," So, I think I want to introduce the camera."
13373920,13376720," So, player can easily get lost outside of the screen."
13376720,13379440," So, let's go."
13379440,13382800," So, we're going to introduce here."
13382800,13383040," Right."
13383040,13384480," So, we have all these things."
13384480,13388320," Like, fill circle, fill erect, fill message."
13388320,13391600," And, I'm not sure if I want to make fill message part of the camera."
13391600,13395600," So, yeah."
13395600,13398160," Okay."
13398160,13399920," Let's introduce a class called camera."
13399920,13401200," Camera."
13402480,13408880," And, interestingly enough."
13408880,13411520," Interestingly enough."
13411520,13411840," Oh!"
13411840,13417600," That may actually make the centering player very easy."
13417600,13419120," Right."
13419120,13426960," So, we can have the position equal to new vector 2, 0, 0."
13426960,13431440," It's a huge process to get the correct environment."
13431440,13434720," It isn't as easy as to just to install libgl.dev."
13434720,13435760," Yeah."
13435760,13436960," And, I'm afraid."
13436960,13445360," I'm a little bit afraid that maybe that will actually slow down that, you know, people adapting Vulcan."
13445360,13448560," But, to be fair, maybe not."
13449200,13459840," Because OpenGL and Vulcan were created in different cultures of the programmers."
13459840,13467600," So, back in OpenGL times, people were okay writing everything from scratch and using these APIs."
13467600,13474880," Vulcan, on the other hand, is developed not really for the programmers, not really for the, like, game development programmers."
13475520,13478480," It's developed to just hook it up into the engines."
13478480,13481920," And, it's expected that you're never going to program in Vulcan directly."
13481920,13485680," It is expected that you're going to use Vulcan via a game engine."
13485680,13488640," So, that's why it's so bureaucratic and so difficult."
13488640,13491600," Because, it's almost like it's not designed for humans."
13491600,13492640," Right."
13492640,13494640," It's more of a, like, it's designed for engines."
13494640,13497280," At least, that's what it feels like."
13497280,13498480," I never programmed in Vulcan."
13498480,13500080," I just read a little bit about it."
13500960,13502560," But, that's my impression of Vulcan."
13502560,13504960," It's not for humans, it's for engines."
13504960,13507920," Something like Ninja Build System."
13507920,13509200," That's a good analogy, by the way."
13509200,13509920," Yeah."
13509920,13510400," Yeah."
13510400,13518320," So, Ninja Build System was designed not for humans, but for other build systems to generate ninja files."
13518320,13519840," Yeah."
13519840,13521120," That's a good analogy, actually."
13521120,13523120," Not bad."
13526240,13527360," So, yeah."
13527360,13533200," What's up?"
13533200,13533840," So, very sour."
13533840,13534640," Welcome to the stream."
13534640,13538240," All right."
13538240,13540720," People are getting bored of me talking about this entire shit."
13540720,13540880," Okay."
13540880,13542080," So, let's introduce the camera."
13542080,13546400," So, yeah."
13546400,13548160," We're not going to have any particular constructors."
13548160,13551520," And, the only methods I'll probably have is DT."
13551520,13551840," Right."
13551840,13554960," Because, I'll need to animate the camera."
13554960,13556080," And, we also need to..."
13556080,13557920," We don't need to render anything, actually."
13557920,13563680," So, what we need here is maybe introduce some grayness."
13563680,13564560," Right."
13564560,13566960," We're going to have some grayness, which is initially zero."
13566960,13571520," And, then we're going to move all of these methods in here."
13571520,13571760," Right."
13571760,13573200," We're going to move them in here."
13573200,13575200," Like this."
13575200,13578640," And, it's going to be just a fill circle."
13578640,13578880," Right."
13578880,13580160," So, we set the context."
13580160,13583280," And, we use just this grayness."
13584240,13585680," It's not a grayscale, grayness."
13585680,13590800," So, and then we're going to remove that."
13590800,13591680," We're going to remove that."
13591680,13593440," But, on top of that."
13593440,13594640," Yes."
13594640,13594960," Yes."
13594960,13595280," Yes."
13595280,13595840," Yes."
13595840,13597680," So, here's the center."
13597680,13599040," And, we need to update it."
13599040,13599360," Right."
13599360,13603360," So, the position of the camera is actually at the center already."
13603360,13606320," So, it's sort of like defines an offset."
13606320,13608640," It's almost like defines an offset."
13610080,13613520," So, we need to take the position of the camera."
13613520,13617120," And, if the position of the camera moved right."
13617120,13618960," To the right."
13618960,13621520," We have to subtract the position of the object."
13621520,13622640," Because, it goes back."
13622640,13626880," So, and we subtract."
13629600,13631760," We take the position of the object."
13631760,13633040," Like the center."
13633040,13635680," And, we subtract the position of the camera."
13635680,13638000," And, that's where we have to render everything."
13638000,13643200," So, let's call it something like screen center."
13643200,13643760," Right."
13643760,13645440," It's going to be screen center."
13645440,13647440," And, then we're going to use the screen center."
13647440,13648800," To actually render everything."
13648800,13650800," Screen center."
13650800,13652000," There we go."
13652000,13653440," So, this is how we're going to do all that."
13653440,13656480," So, and similarly."
13656480,13657200," Similarly."
13657200,13659760," So, if I'm going to have like a field rect."
13659760,13662480," I'm going to have a field rect."
13662480,13664960," And, it's going to be just a method in here."
13664960,13665840," So, we take that."
13665840,13666640," And, we take that."
13666640,13670080," And, here's the x, y."
13670080,13671040," And, what I want to do."
13671040,13672720," I want to create like a new thing here."
13673760,13674640," x and y."
13674640,13675840," And, I'm going to subtract."
13675840,13678080," This pose."
13678080,13679840," And, then we're going to have."
13679840,13682960," Screen position in here."
13682960,13685920," So, and then I can use screen pose."
13685920,13687680," X."
13687680,13689440," And, then screen pose."
13689440,13689840," Y."
13689840,13690320," There we go."
13690320,13692080," So, that seems to be working."
13692080,13693520," Cool."
13693520,13699200," So, but that is not particularly enough."
13702480,13706480," Because, I want the position of the camera to be at its center."
13706480,13708560," So, that means I have to be."
13708560,13710560," Yeah."
13710560,13712240," I have to know width and height."
13712240,13714640," Of the."
13714640,13717520," Of the context and whatnot."
13717520,13718880," So, this is just a greyness."
13718880,13722240," Welcome to the stream."
13722240,13725520," So, you probably missed yesterday's stream."
13725520,13726880," And, everything."
13726880,13728240," Hope you're okay, by the way."
13728240,13729600," We're developing just a game."
13729600,13734320," That you can actually play on the totting channel."
13734320,13735360," So, you can play it here."
13735360,13737120," If you're interested."
13737120,13739520," So, and."
13739520,13742640," Essentially, this is how it looks like."
13742640,13743200," Right."
13743200,13744720," So, you can move around."
13744720,13746320," And, you can shoot at things."
13746320,13747440," And, you can kill things."
13747440,13748960," And, that's pretty much it."
13748960,13752560," So, yeah."
13752560,13757440," So, the most interesting part is going to be at the end of the game."
13757440,13758880," Because, basically."
13758880,13761840," As time goes on."
13761840,13763520," The more things are getting spawned."
13763520,13766800," So, and at some point you won't be able to keep up."
13766800,13776160," So, that's kind of the premise of the game."
13776160,13790240," It's just like life."
13790240,13791200," Yes, exactly."
13796800,13799040," And, at some point you die."
13799040,13800720," And, it displays your score."
13800720,13804560," Yep."
13804560,13808720," So, that's pretty much the game so far."
13808720,13809840," We keep improving it."
13809840,13811760," We keep making it better."
13811760,13814960," I'm not sure about leaderboard."
13814960,13818000," Because, for leaderboard, I need like a server and whatnot."
13818000,13818560," But, maybe."
13818560,13821600," Maybe not in today's stream."
13821600,13826000," This insane increasing difficulty is so funny."
13826000,13827600," Yeah, it's kind of funny looking away."
13827600,13832800," I think it should be way more subtle."
13832800,13834000," That's definitely."
13834000,13839200," Don't you think?"
13839200,13842240," Well, I don't know."
13842240,13843520," I didn't notice."
13843520,13846320," I didn't notice that."
13846320,13849280," No, I don't think so."
13849280,13854240," No, I don't think it's too quick."
13855040,13859280," Nah, never come to my head."
13859280,13862320," Didn't think about that."
13862320,13863200," I don't think it's too bad."
13863200,13864400," Anyways."
13864400,13866000," So, let's continue."
13866000,13867440," So, we're going to have a camera."
13867440,13869680," And, I also want to have some sort of like a camera velocity."
13870320,13871520," Um, yeah."
13871520,13872080," Let me think."
13872080,13873360," I need to probably draw."
13873360,13877760," Sozin."
13877760,13883040," Didn't you notice that, you know, the enemies are spawning very fast?"
13883040,13885360," Did you notice?"
13885360,13888320," Like, you developed the whole game from the ground up."
13888320,13890480," And didn't you notice that it spawned too fast?"
13892000,13893120," I don't know, Zodin."
13893120,13894080," I think you should notice that."
13894080,13895360," So, Pinik."
13895360,13896000," What's up?"
13896000,13896480," What's up?"
13896480,13901920," Have you seen the epic death effect that we introduced?"
13901920,13905280," So, we now have a pretty epic death effect."
13905280,13905920," Let me show you."
13906880,13907760," So, uh."
13907760,13910000," Yeah."
13910000,13910800," So, essentially."
13910800,13913920," As the enemies touch you more and more."
13913920,13915520," Uh."
13915520,13916000," Yeah."
13916000,13917200," So, this is the death effect."
13917200,13919200," Essentially."
13919200,13923120," It's not like as dramatic as at the end of the game."
13923120,13924080," Uh."
13924080,13924960," So, essentially."
13924960,13927760," If we set the spawn rate."
13927760,13931600," To like 0, 0, 0, 1."
13931600,13932560," At the beginning."
13932560,13935120," Like, if we actually make it spawn like crazy."
13935120,13936880," Since the beginning of the game."
13936880,13937520," Uh."
13937520,13939840," The effect is going to be more dramatic actually."
13939840,13941440," Look, look, look."
13941440,13943280," So, uh."
13943280,13944960," Oh, shit."
13944960,13945440," I'm actually."
13945440,13946400," Goddammit."
13946400,13948560," Uh."
13948560,13951840," Something is broken."
13951840,13952240," Of course."
13952240,13958640," Um."
13958640,13959520," Everything is broken."
13959520,13961920," Okay."
13963600,13964640," And of course I need to."
13964640,13970320," I was in the middle of implementing something."
13970320,13974800," It's kind of difficult to do demos in the middle of implementing something."
13974800,13976160," Okay."
13976160,13977280," So, look, look."
13977280,13978640," When you start doing that."
13978640,13979360," And then."
13979360,13980720," It kills you."
13980720,13981840," It's even more dramatic."
13981840,13982160," I think."
13982160,13982960," Right."
13982960,13984880," Especially if we have a shit ton of enemies."
13984880,13986400," And a shit ton of particles."
13986400,13987520," It just looks so cool."
13987520,13988000," And it like."
13988000,13989440," We go into bullet time."
13989440,13992720," This is pretty cool."
13992720,13994720," All right."
13994720,13997200," I don't know if you noticed."
13997200,13999200," But there is a pretty cool mechanic."
13999200,14003280," Basically."
14003280,14005520," The enemies don't attack you."
14005520,14007040," Until you go through a tutorial."
14007040,14008400," There is a tutorial phase."
14008960,14011360," So, you can stay here for as long as you want."
14011360,14013680," The enemies don't start spawning."
14013680,14015600," Until you try to move."
14015600,14017360," Then."
14017360,14019040," Until you try to shoot."
14019040,14022240," And now."
14022240,14023360," They start spawning."
14023360,14024160," So, basically."
14024160,14025280," The game makes sure."
14025280,14026720," That you know how to play the game."
14026720,14027920," And only then."
14027920,14029040," It starts spawning enemies."
14029040,14030160," So."
14030160,14030400," Yeah."
14030400,14031440," And we have a tutorial."
14031440,14033040," As a simple state machine."
14033040,14034480," That basically switches its state."
14034480,14035680," On different events."
14035680,14035920," Right."
14035920,14036560," So, basically."
14036560,14037600," First it waits for you."
14037600,14038480," To move a little bit."
14038480,14039440," Then it waits for you."
14039440,14040080," To shoot."
14040080,14040800," And only then."
14040800,14042160," It allows spawning."
14042160,14043120," So, it's actually pretty cool."
14043120,14043520," I really."
14043520,14045120," I'm really happy with this tutorial."
14045120,14046240," So."
14046240,14046800," And it's."
14046800,14048400," It's actually super subtle."
14048400,14049600," This tutorial is super subtle."
14049600,14050560," Because the majority of people."
14050560,14051440," Who start playing this game."
14051440,14052880," They don't even notice this tutorial."
14052880,14054240," And they don't even notice that."
14054240,14055760," The enemies don't spawn."
14055760,14057120," Until you actually go through it."
14057120,14057680," It's just like."
14057680,14058240," Very subtle."
14058240,14059200," And very cool."
14059200,14059840," I really like that."
14059840,14063600," Yeah."
14065520,14066240," So, that's pretty."
14066240,14066960," It's pretty cool."
14066960,14068480," Anyways."
14068480,14072560," So, what I was doing."
14072560,14073200," What I was doing."
14073200,14076320," So, it's going to be like that."
14076320,14079920," Oh, shit."
14079920,14082000," I think I'm an idiot."
14082000,14084320," I just actually."
14084320,14087280," Discarded the stashed changes."
14087280,14088560," Above the camera."
14088560,14089440," Yeah, fucking damage."
14089440,14089760," Okay."
14089760,14094480," All right."
14094480,14094800," So."
14094800,14098640," I want to unplug this."
14098640,14099280," And I think."
14099280,14112880," So, let's introduce the camera."
14112880,14113440," It's again."
14113440,14114880," Because you accidentally removed it."
14118160,14119040," Well, I mean."
14119040,14120240," Yeah."
14120240,14122240," I'm using Vanilla API."
14122240,14122640," Well, I mean."
14122640,14122880," Yes."
14122880,14124240," I'm using HTML5 canvas."
14124240,14124480," I mean."
14124480,14125440," That's already something."
14125440,14127280," HTML5 canvas."
14127280,14128880," It's pretty much like a whole framework."
14128880,14132080," That you can work with."
14132080,14134000," All right."
14137840,14138160," Okay."
14138160,14139280," So, here's that."
14139280,14140800," And this is that."
14140800,14141040," Okay."
14141040,14142160," So, let's introduce the camera."
14142160,14143680," Camera."
14143680,14146000," And we're going to have a position."
14146000,14148320," Which is initially zero."
14148320,14149680," Right."
14149680,14150560," All of that is zero."
14152000,14154560," And we also probably want to have a velocity."
14154560,14154800," Right."
14154800,14158400," And we're also going to have a grayness."
14158400,14160880," Which is initially zero."
14162160,14164080," And what we want to do here."
14164080,14167840," We want to move all of these things into the camera."
14167840,14172080," We're moving them into the camera."
14172080,14172320," Cool."
14172320,14176080," So, all of that becomes this."
14176080,14177520," And then this."
14177520,14182160," And this global grayness becomes just this grayness."
14182160,14183760," There we go."
14183760,14186000," So, then I go to the class game."
14186000,14188640," And I'm introducing the camera."
14188640,14190240," And funny enough."
14191600,14195760," So, I will have to pass camera everywhere now."
14195760,14198480," So, which is not particularly convenient in my opinion."
14198480,14208320," What I'm thinking is that maybe camera should wrap the context."
14208320,14210160," I think that's the best way to go about it."
14210160,14213760," Camera should wrap the context."
14213760,14215440," And every time we're passing the context."
14215440,14217040," So, instead of passing context around."
14217040,14219120," We should pass camera around."
14219120,14219440," Yes."
14219440,14220720," That's actually a way better approach."
14221600,14222800," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
14222800,14225520," So, and that means we'll have to introduce a constructor."
14225520,14228720," Constructor."
14228720,14230960," Context."
14230960,14233440," So, we're creating a camera for a specific context."
14233440,14237760," So, and that means we don't have to specify this anymore."
14237760,14242240," And if we want to refer to the context."
14242240,14242800," And if we want to refer to the context."
14242800,14243760," We can just do that."
14243760,14246560," Right."
14246560,14251440," Then just do that."
14251440,14253360," Yep."
14253360,14255360," That's pretty cool."
14255360,14259360," And because of that maybe it makes sense to put the film message into the camera."
14259360,14260320," Right."
14260320,14260400," Right."
14260400,14265200," Into the camera."
14265200,14269120," So, this one is going to be this."
14269120,14273840," And the context is actually also this."
14273840,14275200," There we go."
14275200,14277280," Nice."
14278560,14282080," And what's funny is that we should create that camera."
14282080,14285040," Well."
14285040,14287280," Well, well."
14287280,14289360," It should be part of the game."
14289360,14293200," Should be part of the game."
14294960,14296080," If you ask me."
14296080,14299680," But we need to be able to construct the game there."
14299680,14303360," That means I'll have to move the game back into here."
14303360,14306720," Yeah."
14306720,14307280," Maybe not."
14307280,14308000," Maybe it doesn't matter."
14308000,14308800," But whatever."
14308800,14312800," Because now I need to provide the context."
14312800,14313920," And in the game."
14313920,14315040," In the constructor of the game."
14315040,14317520," Do we even have a constructor of the game?"
14317520,14318560," No, I don't."
14318560,14319440," Constructor."
14319440,14322080," I construct the context."
14322080,14322320," Right."
14322320,14323440," So, here's the context."
14324400,14325280," And in here."
14325280,14326400," I'm going to do this."
14326400,14327440," Camera."
14327440,14328400," New."
14328400,14329600," Camera."
14329600,14330800," Context."
14330800,14331680," Here we go."
14331680,14333600," And."
14333600,14336800," No."
14336800,14339600," Because of that."
14339600,14340880," When I'm rendering everything."
14340880,14342640," I don't have to provide this context anymore."
14342640,14343680," Yes."
14343680,14344560," I don't have to provide it."
14344560,14347760," Because the game has that context."
14347760,14348640," Inside of the camera."
14348640,14350320," Yes."
14350320,14350720," Perfect."
14350720,14352560," So, now."
14353600,14355120," On a render thing."
14355120,14355840," In the context."
14355840,14356800," Right."
14356800,14360240," What I'm doing here."
14360240,14360640," Is just."
14360640,14361040," I'm doing."
14361040,14362320," This."
14362320,14362880," Camera."
14362880,14363520," Context."
14363520,14364080," Canvas."
14364080,14364400," Width."
14364400,14366640," Which is a little bit crazy."
14366640,14367520," But that's okay."
14367520,14369040," Clear."
14369040,14369600," Rect."
14369600,14370000," All right."
14370000,14370560," So, clear."
14370560,14370960," React."
14370960,14374880," Is very interesting."
14374880,14379760," So, I might as well actually make it method of the camera."
14379760,14381440," You know what I mean?"
14381440,14384160," So, I can say something like clear."
14384160,14384640," Right."
14384640,14385440," And."
14385440,14386480," It's not going to accept anything."
14386480,14387760," And we're going to do something clear."
14387760,14388080," Rect."
14388080,14389600," So, first of all."
14389600,14391440," We're going to take the width and height."
14391440,14392880," The current width and height."
14392880,14393760," And then we're going to do."
14394640,14395040," This."
14395040,14395680," Context."
14395680,14396960," Clear."
14396960,14397440," Rect."
14397440,14398320," And zero."
14398320,14399040," Zero."
14399040,14399680," Width."
14399680,14400640," Height."
14400640,14401680," And I think that's it."
14401680,14403600," Not react."
14403600,14404000," Rect."
14404000,14405920," Clear."
14405920,14406320," Rect."
14406320,14407200," Where is another one?"
14407200,14407520," Clear."
14407520,14408320," Rect."
14408320,14410480," And so, now I can just do this."
14410480,14411520," Camera."
14411520,14412880," Clear."
14412880,14413360," There we go."
14413360,14416880," So, yeah."
14416880,14418480," When I render the entities."
14418480,14421440," Render entities is not a part of the game."
14421440,14422400," And I think it should."
14422400,14424400," It should be part of the game."
14424400,14425920," If you know what I mean."
14425920,14428800," So, it should be part of the game."
14428800,14433600," So, because then you don't have to provide the context."
14433600,14437840," So, the only thing you can do now is just to provide this camera."
14439280,14439680," Right."
14439680,14442000," And now, I can just do like this."
14442000,14445520," Refactoring JavaScript is actually hella scary."
14445520,14448000," So, Supini, are you still here?"
14448000,14450080," How do you refactor JavaScript?"
14450080,14453520," This shit is so fucking scary."
14453520,14454560," How people do that?"
14454560,14459280," All right."
14459280,14462960," Because you may forget something."
14462960,14465120," And that will get into production."
14465920,14466720," And like."
14466720,14468720," I just don't know how people do that."
14468720,14469200," Seriously."
14469200,14471440," Camera."
14471440,14473520," So, this camera."
14473520,14479920," Okay."
14479920,14485120," You probably rely on ideas or something."
14485120,14485440," Yeah."
14485440,14486880," Okay."
14486880,14488400," Context."
14488400,14489840," So, here's the camera."
14489840,14490960," Here's the context."
14490960,14492000," And stuff like that."
14492000,14494160," So, that makes sense."
14494160,14494400," Okay."
14494400,14495440," When I'm writing a particle."
14495440,14496720," I'm rendering particles."
14496720,14497040," Right."
14497040,14501920," There's a type in there."
14501920,14502400," Height."
14502400,14502720," Maybe."
14502720,14504400," Camera."
14504400,14505760," Right."
14505760,14507280," And then we can do something like."
14507280,14509040," Camera."
14509040,14511120," Clear."
14511120,14512880," Yeah."
14512880,14518240," Height."
14518240,14520160," Let's go back."
14520160,14524400," Render camera."
14524400,14525280," Okay."
14525280,14527440," Render context."
14527440,14527760," Okay."
14527760,14529200," So, now it's just a camera."
14529200,14532800," And it's going to be a camera."
14532800,14536400," Render context."
14536400,14538560," So, I now have to go through all of these things."
14538560,14538960," Camera."
14538960,14540480," And this will become."
14540480,14542480," Camera."
14542480,14543120," This."
14543120,14547200," Render context."
14547200,14548800," Camera."
14548800,14552400," Camera."
14555280,14558400," I don't even remember what Supinic uses."
14558400,14562080," I remember that he uses some sort of IDE."
14562080,14563200," But I don't remember which one."
14563200,14567760," Context."
14567760,14570240," Okay."
14570240,14571600," So, this one is a camera."
14571600,14580240," Render context."
14580240,14582240," I think I went through everything here."
14582240,14584320," So, here's the context only in the camera."
14585680,14587040," Context only in the camera."
14587040,14591440," Then I construct the context here."
14591440,14592640," Then I take width and height."
14592640,14593520," I might as well actually."
14593520,14597920," Turn this entire stuff into the methods of the camera."
14597920,14600080," Right."
14600080,14602080," So, context."
14602080,14606160," And I guess that's it."
14606160,14606560," Yeah, yeah."
14606560,14608400," So, I actually refactored everything, I think."
14609040,14610720," So, in the class camera."
14610720,14612960," Class camera."
14612960,14615200," I can now have width and height."
14615200,14617040," Let me see."
14617040,14619520," So, it's going to be width."
14619520,14621440," Which is essentially."
14621440,14624240," Retur."
14624240,14625360," Emacs."
14625360,14626400," By the way."
14627760,14629440," Can I just have GS mode?"
14629440,14630400," Because it's kind of."
14630400,14631920," Yeah."
14631920,14632560," Retur."
14632560,14633120," Oh my god."
14633120,14634800," Maybe GS2 mode."
14634800,14639120," Context canvas."
14639120,14640800," Width."
14640800,14649120," Okay."
14649120,14649360," Cool."
14649360,14651360," All righty."
14651360,14651680," All righty."
14651680,14652240," All righty."
14652240,14654160," So, I need to sip my tea."
14654160,14662400," Sorry if I missed something."
14662400,14665040," But what's the reason why you're using GS instead of TS?"
14665040,14667520," Because TS introduces additional cost to maintenance."
14667520,14675520," Which might come to some people as a shock."
14675520,14679600," But yes, there is a maintenance cost in using TypeScript."
14682000,14682400," There is."
14682400,14685680," I can demonstrate you."
14685680,14687280," Actually."
14687280,14689120," Right now."
14689120,14695840," I can just open this file in the browser."
14695840,14699440," And that's it."
14699440,14701280," I just started the game."
14701280,14703120," You don't have to do anything."
14703120,14705120," I just started the game."
14705120,14705680," It's that easy."
14706720,14712000," In case of a TypeScript, I have to basically have an additional step."
14712000,14719600," And for example, if I want to automatically deploy this game via GitHub Actions, right?"
14719600,14729600," That means I have to set up CI that runs TypeScript and puts it into appropriate branch and make sure everything's okay."
14730160,14731840," So, in this case, I don't have to do that."
14731840,14737120," In that case, I can just enable GitHub Pages and it will just automatically work."
14737120,14739200," So, yeah."
14742000,14743680," That's the reason why I'm not using TypeScript."
14743680,14744640," Does it make sense?"
14744640,14753680," But the gain is much higher."
14753680,14755040," Numbers."
14755040,14755840," Show me the numbers."
14755840,14758160," Demonstrate that it's higher."
14758160,14758720," Proof."
14758720,14759360," Where is the proof?"
14759360,14766320," It's just a claim that is not backed by anything."
14766320,14775760," It's just a meaningless claim."
14775760,14784960," I just demonstrated you that how it decreases the maintenance cost by"
14784960,14787280," actually eliminating this in these steps."
14787280,14793360," And the claim that the gain is much higher is just not backed by anything."
14793360,14793920," So, I'm sorry."
14793920,14798240," Again, not backed by anything."
14798240,14799680," Not backed by anything."
14799680,14802160," Just a meaningless claim."
14802160,14804080," All right."
14804080,14806000," So, let's continue."
14813600,14813920," Cool."
14813920,14827120," So, let's go back."
14827120,14828800," And let me see."
14828800,14829440," Let me see."
14829440,14830160," So, this is..."
14830160,14833760," All right."
14833760,14835520," So, let me refresh everything."
14835520,14837280," And let's go through the compilation errors."
14837280,14840640," A global grayness is not defined."
14840640,14841200," So, oh yeah."
14841200,14842560," This is basically where we do that."
14842560,14845040," So, I need to go through all the places where we use global grayness."
14845040,14848800," We probably don't need it anymore."
14848800,14850240," Wait a second."
14850240,14850480," Okay."
14850480,14851760," Yeah."
14851760,14854320," Global grayness."
14854320,14855680," So, now I can just do this."
14855680,14857840," Camera."
14857840,14859440," Grayness."
14859440,14862400," Camera."
14862400,14863360," Grayness."
14863360,14867280," Global."
14867280,14868000," I think that's it."
14868000,14868400," Okay."
14868400,14868880," So, let's see."
14868880,14872080," All right."
14872080,14873440," So, there's still one error."
14873440,14876800," A field message."
14876800,14877120," Okay."
14877120,14879200," So, where is a field message?"
14879200,14881360," So, that's another mistake."
14881360,14892240," Oh, right."
14892240,14907760," I want to play until the death."
14907760,14910160," Just to go through all of the execution paths."
14910160,14916640," And also play this."
14916640,14917200," Sure."
14917200,14938160," Okay."
14938160,14943600," So, now another compilation error."
14943600,14944640," Yep."
14944640,14949360," So, field message."
14949360,14950080," What does it say?"
14950080,14951120," Oh, yeah."
14951120,14952720," There's no such thing as field message."
14952720,14954000," All right."
14954000,14956960," So, this field message."
14956960,14957920," This camera."
14957920,14958240," Okay."
14960480,14960960," Camera."
14960960,14964080," Camera field message."
14964080,14964400," All right."
14964400,14968080," So, I might as well actually."
14968080,14973840," Set the spawn rating to."
14973840,14975840," Zero."
14975840,14976240," Zero."
14976240,14976480," One."
14976480,14978480," To make it a little bit higher."
14978480,14980880," Just refresh everything."
14980880,14982880," So, it should start."
14982880,14986080," Almost immediately."
14986080,14986800," And yeah."
14986800,14987200," There we go."
14988000,14989600," So, that's pretty pogue."
14989600,14990320," Not gonna lie."
14990320,14993360," All right."
14993360,14998000," That's pretty pogue."
14998000,14999200," So, we introduced the camera."
14999200,15000160," So, in the camera."
15000160,15002480," In the camera."
15002480,15003440," Class camera."
15003440,15007360," So, I also want to have an update function."
15007360,15007680," Right."
15011680,15013840," That's basically."
15013840,15014400," Oh my god."
15014400,15015200," It's so slow."
15015200,15017120," GS2 mod is extremely slow actually."
15017120,15019920," I'm gonna try to switch to just a regular GS mod."
15019920,15022080," Because the GS2 mod is very slow."
15022080,15028160," TypeScript would probably catch that field message error."
15028160,15029920," Just like runtime of v8."
15029920,15033280," What kind of argument is that?"
15033280,15036000," What kind of argument is that?"
15036000,15038480," That's literally what v8 environment did."
15038480,15040160," It also catch that error."
15040160,15043840," Okay."
15043840,15045120," So, here's the thing."
15045120,15051200," I do not disagree that statically typed compiled languages are better than dynamically typed."
15051200,15052480," Trust me."
15052480,15056400," Like, I'm a huge fan of statically typed programming languages."
15056400,15058160," Guys, your arguments are shit."
15058960,15061840," We are not defending your favorite paradigm really well."
15061840,15067440," I do agree."
15067440,15071120," I do agree that, like, statically typed compiled languages are great."
15071120,15073920," But your arguments for that are shit."
15073920,15074480," Straight up."
15074480,15075600," I'm sorry to tell you that."
15075600,15076160," No offense."
15076160,15077120," So..."
15077120,15081440," So..."
15081440,15082080," Because, yes."
15082080,15083760," That's exactly what the runtime did."
15083760,15086240," That's exactly what runtime did."
15086240,15086880," So what?"
15086880,15087920," How is that an argument?"
15088960,15098160," ""In my opinion, it always depends on the project and your personal preference for this small game."
15098160,15102320," You don't need all of these advantages that TS brings a bigger project."
15102320,15104880," Which, more personally, I would never go back to JS."""
15104880,15105360," You're right."
15105360,15107280," This is exactly why I'm doing that in JavaScript."
15107280,15107840," Seriously."
15107840,15113760," Because I'm going to just jam this program for two days."
15113760,15115360," And I'm just going to forget about it."
15115360,15124560," I'm going to waste more time on setting up the NPM project and also continuous integration to deploy it."
15124560,15139760," Like, stuff like that instead of actually prototyping the game."
15139760,15144320," So, again, look."
15144320,15145920," I just opened the HTML."
15145920,15147840," The game is running."
15147840,15148240," That's it."
15148240,15149040," I'm already running the game."
15149040,15150160," I don't have to do anything."
15150160,15151920," The cost is just beautiful."
15153040,15156960," So, my problem with people defending their technologies."
15156960,15161920," They always act like there is no cost or cost is negligible."
15163200,15166880," That's my problem with people when they try to defend their technology."
15166880,15170480," Like, they become completely blind to the cost."
15170480,15172400," Absolutely fucking blind."
15172400,15176240," And they make absolutely fucking insane claims about the cost."
15176240,15177360," It's just, oh my god."
15177360,15179040," Holy fuck."
15179040,15182640," There's always a cost."
15182640,15184480," No matter what the fuck you're trying to do."
15186320,15186720," All right."
15186720,15190080," So, and I learned that very hard way."
15190080,15199840," And what's funny is that you don't even try to understand what I'm doing."
15199840,15200080," Right?"
15200080,15205680," So, you're not even trying to understand the context of this project."
15205680,15206640," You don't care."
15206640,15209440," You just come here to defend your favorite technology."
15209440,15209680," Right?"
15209680,15211920," So, do you even care what I'm doing?"
15211920,15214560," Like, do you even care what is my goal?"
15214560,15217360," And, like, anything else in the context?"
15217360,15218080," You probably don't."
15218080,15219680," Seriously."
15219680,15221600," You're just here to annoy everyone."
15221600,15222960," So, I don't know."
15222960,15228400," Cool."
15228400,15233920," So, here's the update."
15233920,15235600," And how are we going to do that, actually?"
15235600,15236640," So, I was going to pause."
15238720,15243120," And it's going to be add this bell scale."
15243120,15244480," And we're going to scale it by the team."
15244480,15247200," And it's going to be just pause."
15247200,15251440," So, this is how we're going to update the velocity."
15251440,15257280," And velocity is going to be set to this entire thing."
15268400,15275680," So, here's the update."
15275680,15284880," The thing is, now, I need to update the center accordingly."
15284880,15285120," Right?"
15285120,15288800," So, I take the..."
15288800,15292560," So, if position is dead, center should go to the left."
15292560,15294000," So, I mean, I'm subtracting."
15294000,15299040," So, I take center and I subtract this position."
15299040,15302240," So, I just subtract it and it goes to the left."
15302240,15303840," And that's exactly what I want to do."
15303840,15307120," But then, in another case, like, the actual position..."
15307120,15311280," The actual position will depend on width and height."
15311280,15318400," So, that means I should have some centered position or whatnot."
15318400,15320080," All right."
15320080,15327280," So, maybe I also have to take width and height in here."
15329680,15334320," And I need to really think how we're going to do all of that."
15334320,15348400," Okay."
15348400,15353040," So, what do we have here?"
15356160,15359440," So, here's the position and essentially..."
15359440,15359840," Oh, my God."
15359840,15361920," I need to do this entire thing."
15361920,15365360," Right."
15365360,15366800," So, here's the position."
15366800,15369120," And if I change it here, it's going to be that."
15369120,15373600," But if I want this to be at the center,"
15373600,15378400," that means I have to add half of the screen to the center."
15378400,15378640," Okay."
15378640,15379680," So, that kind of makes sense."
15380480,15385120," So, I subtract the position and I add this v2."
15385120,15389200," And I need to calculate this entire thing as well."
15389200,15393920," So, maybe I just need a function"
15393920,15398640," toScreen, right?"
15398640,15399760," ToScreen."
15399760,15402080," So, which accepts the point, right?"
15402080,15404640," Which accepts the point and maps that point to the screen."
15406000,15407520," So, and the way it's going to do that."
15407520,15410400," The way it's going to do that."
15410400,15412960," Center."
15412960,15414640," Sub."
15414640,15417040," Point."
15417040,15417840," Well, not center."
15417840,15418960," Like, actually point."
15418960,15420800," Then this position."
15420800,15422320," And then it should add"
15422320,15425200," v2."
15425200,15425920," Width."
15425920,15426720," To."
15426720,15427120," Height."
15427120,15428400," To."
15428400,15432160," And then it should return this entire thing."
15433760,15434080," Cool."
15434080,15434880," Now."
15434880,15436720," So, I have a center."
15436720,15440000," And I need to map it to something else."
15440000,15440960," It's going to be what?"
15440960,15443280," Screen center."
15443280,15443520," Right?"
15443520,15444480," Screen center."
15444480,15445440," It's going to be this."
15445440,15446240," To screen."
15446240,15448320," Center."
15448320,15450800," Screen center."
15450800,15454960," Screen center."
15454960,15455600," There we go."
15455600,15458080," So, this one could be const."
15458080,15458960," Whatever."
15458960,15459840," Doesn't matter."
15459840,15461040," Calm down."
15462320,15462640," Okay."
15462640,15463680," So, this one is."
15463680,15465280," Width and height."
15465280,15466320," So, this shouldn't be."
15466320,15468160," All right."
15468160,15468400," So."
15468400,15471600," New v2."
15471600,15474160," It's going to be xy."
15474160,15476400," And I need to do this."
15476400,15478640," To screen."
15478640,15478880," Right."
15478880,15480800," I need to convert it to screen."
15480800,15482320," And then it's going to be const."
15482320,15483680," Screen center."
15483680,15485280," Screen."
15485280,15486240," Pause."
15486240,15488000," Screen."
15488000,15488480," Pause."
15488480,15489920," And it's going to be screen."
15489920,15490800," Pause x."
15490800,15492160," Screen."
15492160,15493200," Pause y."
15493200,15493520," Cool."
15493520,15495200," Screen."
15495200,15495680," Pause y."
15495680,15495920," Okay."
15495920,15502960," So, let me see."
15502960,15505280," And it kind of."
15505280,15507040," It didn't really work."
15507040,15508480," If you think about it."
15508480,15510640," So, why is it like that?"
15513760,15514800," It's kind of the center."
15514800,15516320," But also at the same time."
15516320,15517040," It's kind of like."
15517040,15519520," Huh."
15519520,15520800," It's not really at the center."
15520800,15521120," Why?"
15521120,15526640," So, you take."
15526640,15526960," Ah."
15526960,15527920," I know why."
15527920,15528640," I know."
15528640,15529280," That makes."
15529280,15529680," Apps."
15529680,15529840," Yeah."
15529840,15530800," That makes perfect sense."
15530800,15532160," This is exactly what should happen."
15532160,15534800," So, it works as intended."
15534800,15536800," So, essentially you need to spawn the player."
15537440,15538000," At zero."
15538000,15538320," Zero."
15538320,15539440," All right."
15539440,15540720," You should spawn the player at zero."
15540720,15541040," Zero."
15541040,15544480," Okay."
15544480,15545760," Perfect."
15545760,15546160," Oh my god."
15546160,15547360," This is actually looks so cool."
15547360,15549040," I really like this."
15549040,15550800," It's kind of off-centered."
15550800,15551280," Holy fuck."
15551280,15552480," I only noticed that."
15552480,15553440," How off-centered it is."
15553440,15556800," Can I now."
15556800,15559200," Do the following thing."
15559200,15561440," In terms of height."
15561440,15563040," Subtract."
15563040,15565680," 15."
15567440,15569120," Uh-huh."
15569120,15571120," So, I need to close."
15571120,15571680," Oh my god."
15571680,15573120," Just close it."
15573120,15574000," Oh shit."
15574000,15576720," Uh-huh."
15576720,15578960," Uh."
15578960,15579680," Not subtract."
15579680,15580000," Add."
15580000,15582640," Uh-huh."
15582640,15584000," No."
15584000,15584240," It's."
15584240,15587360," Why did it actually do that?"
15587360,15590320," Why is it not."
15590320,15591600," So, it's probably not in pixels."
15591600,15591760," But."
15591760,15594240," Could be all right."
15594240,15595280," Uh."
15597440,15600560," Oh shit."
15600560,15603520," The mouse is not moved correctly."
15603520,15603840," Okay."
15603840,15604720," Mouse position."
15604720,15608320," Now we need to do the opposite thing."
15608320,15608720," Okay."
15608720,15610400," So, mouse position."
15610400,15612320," Uh-huh."
15612320,15618080," And we need to take the mouse position from the screen and move it into the world."
15618080,15618320," Right."
15618320,15619440," We have two screen."
15619440,15621200," And we need to move it to world."
15621200,15622080," Right."
15622080,15623520," So, it's going to be the point."
15623520,15624960," And it's going to be kind of similar."
15624960,15625360," It's just."
15625360,15627280," You have to do the separations in reverse."
15627280,15628800," In a reversed order."
15628800,15629040," Right."
15629040,15629840," It's going to be point."
15629840,15630720," Sub."
15630720,15631680," Uh."
15631680,15634160," This thing."
15634160,15636080," And add."
15636080,15638400," This position."
15638400,15640240," So, that's basically what it is."
15640240,15641680," It's just basically a reversed one."
15641680,15642640," Uh."
15642640,15642960," Right."
15642960,15644080," And mouse pose."
15644080,15645920," Uh."
15645920,15646480," So, by the way."
15646480,15647440," You don't need this one."
15647440,15647760," I think."
15647760,15649280," But we can remove that later."
15649280,15650240," So, mouse pose."
15650240,15651680," You take this camera."
15651680,15653040," Uh."
15653040,15653600," Camera."
15653600,15654240," To world."
15654240,15655120," Right."
15655120,15656000," You move it to the world."
15656000,15658720," And that should actually bring us the happiness."
15658720,15660320," And I think it did."
15660320,15661280," Perfect."
15661280,15663760," So, that's pretty cool."
15663760,15665040," So, we start at the center."
15665040,15667840," And everything looks okey dokey."
15667840,15669760," You know what's cool."
15669760,15671280," You know what's cool."
15671280,15675440," Now, we are ready to animate the camera."
15675440,15677360," So, it's going to be update."
15678800,15679600," Uh."
15679600,15680800," Where is the class game?"
15680800,15682880," Update."
15682880,15684720," And what we're doing here."
15684720,15687120," We're just updating everything."
15687120,15688240," I might as well actually."
15688240,15691200," Update the camera somewhere here."
15691200,15694160," We're going to camera."
15694160,15694720," This."
15694720,15695440," Camera."
15695440,15696000," Update."
15696000,15697120," DT."
15697120,15699600," And how we're following the camera."
15699600,15700480," How we're following the camera."
15700480,15702240," I think we're just setting this velocity."
15702240,15702480," This."
15702480,15703680," Camera."
15703680,15704320," Velocity."
15704320,15705040," Is equal to."
15706720,15709040," So, you have a position of the player."
15709040,15710480," And you have a position of the camera."
15710480,15711920," So, you take the position."
15711920,15713200," Uh."
15713200,15715440," Okay."
15715440,15717440," We can do something like set target."
15717440,15718960," Uh."
15718960,15720480," this player position."
15720480,15722320," So, and we can move that into the."
15722320,15723280," Uh."
15723280,15724480," Into the logic of the camera."
15724480,15725840," I think that's going to be the best one."
15725840,15726880," So, it's going to be camera."
15726880,15728080," Uh."
15728080,15729040," It's going to be camera."
15729040,15729360," And."
15729360,15732080," So, it's going to be set target."
15732080,15732640," Okay."
15732640,15733680," Set target."
15733680,15734960," And."
15734960,15735680," Uh."
15735680,15737120," So, this is what we're going to have here."
15737120,15739200," And what this thing does."
15739200,15739520," Uh."
15739520,15741120," Let's actually take the target like this."
15741120,15741760," Uh."
15741760,15742960," You take the target."
15742960,15745920," And you subtract the position of the camera."
15745920,15747040," And that gives you the."
15747040,15748320," Uh."
15748320,15748800," A vector."
15748800,15750400," So, we might as well actually."
15750400,15751920," Uh."
15751920,15754560," Set velocity to that specific vector."
15754560,15756080," And it's going to be very interesting."
15756080,15756880," So, let's see how."
15756880,15758000," Uh."
15758000,15759200," Why would we keep recompiled?"
15759200,15760560," Uh."
15760560,15761600," Yeah."
15761600,15765600," So, that looks very strange."
15765600,15769360," So, essentially."
15769360,15772640," Uh."
15772640,15772960," What."
15772960,15775920," It looks so weird."
15775920,15777360," Because there's no point of reference."
15777360,15780880," There's literally no point of reference."
15780880,15782720," And that's really fucking tripping."
15782720,15783440," If you ask me."
15783440,15785040," Uh."
15785040,15788960," Yeah."
15789200,15792400," Yeah."
15792400,15792640," That's."
15792640,15793280," That's too much."
15793280,15794160," But essentially."
15794160,15795040," Uh."
15795040,15796160," What's going on here."
15796160,15796640," Is that."
15796640,15797440," Uh."
15797440,15798080," The camera."
15798080,15799360," Is basically following the player."
15799360,15800560," And you're moving inside."
15800560,15800880," Like."
15800880,15802160," Uh."
15802160,15803280," Yeah."
15803280,15806720," Yeah."
15806720,15808080," There's no point of reference."
15808080,15808880," Unfortunately."
15808880,15811440," Uh."
15811440,15814000," Yeah."
15814000,15814720," That's so bad."
15814720,15815280," You see."
15815280,15816400," You see what's going on here?"
15816400,15818160," You see what's going on?"
15818160,15819120," Uh."
15819120,15820400," Yeah."
15820400,15821200," Uh."
15821200,15821520," Yeah."
15821520,15822240," And then it dies."
15822240,15822960," So."
15822960,15825200," Since there's no point of reference."
15825200,15826880," It's not clear."
15826880,15827680," That the."
15827680,15829440," The camera is actually moving."
15829440,15830000," And what not."
15830000,15830960," So."
15830960,15831200," How."
15831200,15832320," What kind of point of reference."
15832320,15833040," Can be introduced."
15833040,15833680," I don't know."
15833680,15833680," I don't know."
15833680,15841360," Shouldn't be the enemies be the reference."
15841360,15841680," Yes."
15841680,15842320," But they are moving."
15842320,15843200," So."
15849440,15849920," You know what."
15849920,15851600," Maybe we should not do."
15851600,15852080," Uh."
15852080,15853200," The velocity thing then."
15853200,15854880," Uh."
15854880,15855360," What about."
15855360,15857920," What if we set."
15857920,15858800," The."
15858800,15859440," Uh."
15859440,15859760," Yeah."
15859760,15861600," Let's actually literally set it."
15861600,15862240," Like that."
15862240,15863360," But then."
15863360,15865120," You cannot see that you're moving."
15865120,15875600," Then you cannot see that you're moving."
15876000,15876240," So."
15876240,15877760," There should be some sort of a background."
15877760,15878160," So."
15878160,15883600," So."
15883600,15884960," The entire idea with the camera."
15884960,15885360," Is actually."
15885360,15886080," It's not working."
15886080,15889440," The entire idea with the camera."
15889440,15890080," Is not working."
15890080,15894320," Or maybe it is."
15894320,15895520," So."
15895520,15896800," The only thing we can have here."
15896800,15897840," Is the background."
15897840,15899200," Moving background."
15899200,15899520," But."
15899520,15901040," If we're going to have a moving background."
15901040,15901600," Uh."
15901600,15903280," All right."
15906000,15909520," Footprint of the player."
15909520,15910080," Uh."
15910080,15914400," Maybe."
15914400,15928480," Okay."
15928480,15929280," Let's give it a try."
15929280,15930400," That's not a bad idea actually."
15930400,15931040," Um."
15935040,15936160," A slightly visible grid."
15936160,15937360," Could be another idea."
15937360,15937680," Yeah."
15937680,15938720," Uh."
15938720,15942320," Put rocks in the background."
15942320,15943040," It's the same as."
15943040,15943360," Uh."
15943360,15944560," As the grid idea."
15944560,15945120," Same idea."
15945120,15946720," Um."
15946720,15947520," So."
15947520,15950080," I."
15950080,15950880," What do I want you to do?"
15950880,15953280," Trail."
15953280,15953680," Okay."
15953680,15954080," Trail."
15954080,15956880," Class player."
15956880,15957280," Okay."
15957280,15958240," So."
15958240,15958560," Uh."
15958560,15959840," We need some sort of a trail."
15959840,15961120," Inside of the player."
15961120,15961440," All right."
15965040,15965840," Mm-hmm."
15965840,15974480," Okay."
15974480,15975120," So."
15975120,15976880," And every time you update."
15976880,15979520," You push."
15979520,15980240," This thing."
15980240,15981120," Into the trail."
15981120,15981600," Right."
15981600,15982080," Trail."
15982080,15983440," Push."
15983440,15984960," This position."
15984960,15986240," And then you update yourself."
15986240,15987760," All right."
15987760,15989600," When you're rendering yourself."
15989600,15990320," Right."
15990320,15991600," When you're rendering yourself."
15992560,15993760," We can do the following thing."
15993760,15994000," For."
15994000,15995040," Uh."
15995040,15996320," For each."
15996320,15998160," Uh."
15998160,15999440," Dot."
15999440,16001120," Of trail."
16001120,16003600," Uh."
16003600,16006880," Is that how you do that?"
16006880,16009760," Of this?"
16009760,16010880," Oh yeah."
16010880,16011120," So."
16011120,16011680," I'm using."
16011680,16012240," Uh."
16012240,16012880," A different."
16012880,16013520," GS mod."
16013520,16014400," Yeah."
16015200,16015440," So."
16015440,16016080," Of trail."
16016080,16016480," Um."
16016480,16018720," We'll basically subtract."
16018720,16019360," Uh."
16019360,16021440," Well."
16021440,16024000," We'll basically render this circle there."
16024000,16026320," We'll basically render it."
16026320,16028080," At the position of the dot."
16028080,16028800," And that's pretty."
16028800,16029600," Pretty simple."
16029600,16030640," That's pretty straightforward."
16030640,16032320," Uh."
16032320,16033680," That's pretty straightforward."
16033680,16035040," But then."
16035040,16036320," When we update everything."
16036320,16036960," We have to."
16036960,16039600," Just do it like this."
16039600,16042080," Uh."
16042080,16042960," Right."
16044400,16046320," So we might as well actually do this trail."
16046320,16048880," Map."
16048880,16050800," Uh."
16050800,16051360," Is going to be."
16051360,16051680," X."
16051680,16053360," Minus."
16053360,16054560," Uh."
16054560,16057520," Player."
16057520,16058480," Trail."
16058480,16060480," Fade."
16060480,16061360," Out."
16061360,16062480," Rate."
16062480,16063760," Something."
16063760,16065200," Multiplied by dt."
16065200,16066880," So that's the first thing we can do here."
16068080,16070240," And then we can filter."
16070240,16072320," Uh."
16072320,16073200," Filter out."
16073200,16074960," Those."
16074960,16077120," Who are less than zero."
16077120,16078960," So."
16078960,16080480," Oh."
16080480,16080720," It's."
16080720,16081200," It's a."
16081200,16081440," Yeah."
16081440,16082320," We need to know."
16082320,16083040," Position."
16083040,16084000," Plus."
16084000,16085760," It's fade out."
16085760,16086080," Rate."
16086080,16087280," Ooh."
16087280,16088640," Ah."
16089760,16090160," Okay."
16090160,16092000," So that means every time you have to."
16092000,16092960," If you update."
16092960,16093920," You have to push."
16093920,16094560," Not that."
16094560,16095200," But rather."
16095200,16096480," Something like."
16096480,16097040," Pose."
16097040,16098320," And then."
16098320,16100080," Alpha."
16100080,16101360," If I understand correctly."
16101360,16103040," And it's going to be just one."
16103040,16105440," And if you're rendering this entire thing."
16105440,16105600," Right."
16105600,16106880," You're rendering actually."
16106880,16107440," Dot."
16107440,16107920," Pose."
16107920,16108960," Right."
16108960,16109920," You're rendering dot."
16109920,16110480," Pose."
16110480,16111360," And then."
16111360,16112320," When we're filtering out."
16112320,16113280," We're filtering out."
16113280,16113920," Actually."
16113920,16114240," A."
16114240,16115360," So."
16115360,16116880," But we also do it like this."
16116880,16118080," Uh."
16118080,16118800," Mm."
16118800,16120000," Mm."
16120000,16121200," Not really convenient."
16121200,16122000," Okay."
16122000,16122960," So."
16122960,16123520," Um."
16123520,16124880," We have to do it slightly differently."
16124880,16125600," So it's going to be."
16125600,16125920," Let."
16125920,16127600," Dot."
16127600,16128000," Oh yeah."
16128000,16129600," I already have a loop in here."
16129600,16131360," I already have a loop in here."
16131360,16132480," So."
16132480,16133040," Uh."
16133040,16134080," This is going to be dot."
16134080,16134880," A."
16134880,16136240," Uh."
16136240,16137200," Minus."
16137200,16137760," This thing."
16138960,16139520," And."
16139520,16140400," There we."
16140400,16141600," It didn't copy paste it."
16141600,16144160," Didn't copy paste it."
16144160,16144640," Okay."
16144640,16145280," And then."
16145280,16146320," I can do the filter."
16146320,16147280," So."
16147280,16148480," I can do the filter."
16148480,16149040," Hopefully."
16149040,16150080," Uh."
16150080,16151600," It has to be the trail."
16151600,16151920," Right."
16151920,16152960," It has to be the trail."
16152960,16154240," Then."
16154240,16155120," Uh."
16155120,16155760," Right."
16155760,16156320," Then."
16156320,16157200," This trail."
16157200,16158000," There we go."
16158000,16161040," Uh."
16161040,16161760," This trail."
16161760,16162240," And then."
16162240,16164560," Uh."
16164560,16165200," Player."
16165200,16165760," Trail."
16165760,16166960," I already known the player."
16168400,16170240," So how quickly it's going to fade out."
16170240,16170560," Uh."
16170560,16171040," Let's see."
16171040,16171520," So."
16171520,16173840," It could be fading out within a single second."
16173840,16175040," Uh."
16175040,16176720," Maybe it's like a round."
16176720,16177360," Uh."
16177360,16177920," Like two."
16177920,16180080," And it's probably going to be shit."
16180080,16182000," And when I'm actually rendering it."
16182000,16182960," I'm not using A."
16182960,16185920," And I'm wasting too much on this idea."
16185920,16187040," I think it's not going to work."
16187040,16188000," First of all."
16188000,16188560," Second of all."
16188560,16191680," It's just too much time on something that's not going to work."
16191680,16192080," Probably."
16193360,16193680," Um."
16193680,16196960," Too much time on something that's definitely not going to work."
16196960,16197520," Uh."
16197520,16198480," So when I'm fading out."
16198480,16200880," I'm going to just using this with."
16200880,16202000," Alpha."
16202000,16204080," Dot A."
16204080,16205440," So that's basically what we're doing."
16205440,16207840," And let's actually go through the phases of."
16207840,16209280," Uh."
16209280,16210800," This stuff."
16210800,16212480," And."
16212480,16215120," Did it even do anything?"
16215120,16217120," I didn't see anything."
16217120,16218640," It feels like it doesn't do anything."
16220320,16220640," Uh."
16220640,16222480," Does it add anything to the trail?"
16222480,16223200," Maybe it does."
16223200,16225280," So every time we update."
16225280,16226400," We push this there."
16226400,16227440," Uh."
16227440,16228000," Then we."
16228000,16228400," Uh."
16228400,16229040," Iterate."
16229040,16231120," Over DT."
16231120,16232800," It could be too fast actually."
16232800,16233520," So let's actually."
16233520,16234880," Make it like one."
16234880,16236800," Uh."
16236800,16239280," And."
16239280,16239680," Uh."
16239680,16241440," I don't quite understand why it doesn't do that."
16241440,16242960," So when I'm rendering."
16249520,16249920," Uh."
16249920,16254560," So let's try console."
16254560,16256880," And maybe I can do debugger."
16256880,16257280," Yes."
16257280,16258800," There is this thing debugger."
16258800,16260160," Right."
16260160,16260560," So."
16260560,16265360," Uh."
16265360,16266640," Okay."
16266640,16266960," It is."
16266960,16267440," It is not."
16267440,16269680," It is not even doing anything."
16269680,16273680," So because it's never pushing anything."
16273680,16277040," Why is it not ever."
16277040,16279280," Why is it never pushing anything?"
16279520,16280560," Okay."
16280560,16281520," Okay."
16281520,16282880," Wait."
16282880,16282960," Wait."
16282960,16283120," Wait."
16283120,16283200," Wait."
16283200,16283840," It did something."
16283840,16286720," Okay."
16286720,16295040," Well."
16295040,16295760," It should work then."
16295760,16295920," Oh."
16295920,16296860," It's so weird."
16296860,16299020," Did it work or did it not?"
16299020,16299820," I don't understand."
16299820,16302860," Um."
16302860,16305900," Okay."
16305900,16306940," So."
16306940,16309780," It."
16309780,16311900," I'm confused."
16311900,16313660," I'm so tired and confused already."
16316780,16317020," So."
16317020,16317260," So."
16317260,16319260," Is this because of this thing?"
16319260,16319500," Okay."
16319500,16321260," So let's actually never update them."
16321260,16322540," Let's never update them."
16322540,16322780," Okay."
16322780,16323900," Um."
16323900,16325420," Let's never update them."
16325420,16328780," Doesn't work."
16328780,16330540," Am I."
16330540,16331180," Am I crazy?"
16331180,16333020," Am I crazy?"
16334780,16335420," Uh."
16335420,16335740," Um."
16335740,16337020," Why isn't it pushing?"
16337020,16339020," Isn't pushing anything there?"
16339020,16340300," I'm not even updating them."
16340300,16341980," Uh."
16341980,16342540," Ah."
16342540,16343340," Greater."
16343340,16343900," Oh my god."
16343900,16344300," Filter."
16344300,16344620," Okay."
16344620,16347260," So logic of the filter actually screwed me over."
16347260,16347660," I see."
16347660,16347980," I see."
16347980,16349340," Uh."
16349340,16349820," I."
16349820,16350460," Now it's."
16350460,16350780," It's."
16350780,16351260," It's working."
16351260,16351500," Okay."
16351500,16352380," So that makes sense."
16352380,16352540," It's."
16352540,16354300," It's like opposite logic."
16354300,16355740," It's an opposite logic completely."
16355740,16358620," Tapscript would have actually caught that of course."
16359180,16359580," Um."
16359580,16361020," Yeah."
16361020,16361420," There we go."
16361420,16363900," And it looks like shit by the way."
16363900,16364860," Um."
16364860,16369260," It's an interesting idea but it looks like shit."
16369260,16369660," Uh."
16369660,16370940," So."
16370940,16373980," Okay."
16373980,16374220," So."
16374220,16375980," We can try to."
16375980,16376700," Uh."
16376700,16378940," Oh my god."
16378940,16379340," It's so."
16379340,16380140," It's so shitty."
16380140,16380380," Okay."
16380380,16381340," So."
16381340,16381740," Rate."
16381740,16382540," Uh."
16382540,16384460," Let's actually increase the rate twice."
16384460,16385100," And let's see."
16385100,16386620," Uh."
16389420,16389900," Okay."
16389900,16390220," So."
16390220,16391580," It could be something like four."
16391580,16394380," Uh."
16394380,16410700," I really don't like it."
16410700,16414780," But it gives the point of reference though."
16417500,16417820," Uh."
16417820,16426060," And what's funny is it gives you the opportunity to actually move away from the enemies."
16426060,16427500," Uh."
16427500,16431660," Maybe decrease the radius."
16431660,16431900," Yeah."
16431900,16432540," Maybe it's not."
16432540,16433660," Yeah."
16433660,16433900," Okay."
16433900,16436380," So decreasing the radius would be actually kind of cool idea."
16436380,16437100," So I like that."
16437100,16438620," Uh."
16438620,16439740," All right."
16439740,16442700," So it could be like half of it."
16442700,16444700," Let's say it's going to be half of it."
16445340,16447180," It could be actually decreasing the work time."
16447180,16448540," Like over."
16448540,16453340," Okay."
16453340,16453900," So."
16453900,16455420," How about make it faster."
16455420,16457900," Uh."
16457900,16458460," Rate."
16458460,16459580," It's going to be eight."
16459580,16461020," Uh."
16461020,16464700," Okay."
16464700,16467500," So making it faster is actually worth it."
16473500,16480620," What about like six?"
16480620,16488220," And also I want to change the thing over time."
16488220,16489740," Uh."
16489740,16490060," Rate."
16490060,16491420," Okay."
16491420,16493260," So the way we're going to do that actually."
16494620,16495260," Is."
16495260,16495580," Uh."
16495580,16497340," We'll need an N."
16497340,16499180," And it's going to be const."
16499180,16499420," And."
16499420,16500940," This trail."
16500940,16502060," Length."
16502060,16503900," Length."
16503900,16504380," I said."
16504380,16505820," Length."
16505820,16506300," I said."
16506300,16507740," Thank you very much."
16507740,16509340," Uh."
16509340,16510620," And."
16510620,16512220," We need to iterate them by indices."
16512220,16512940," Unfortunately."
16512940,16514060," I wish I could do that."
16514060,16514700," Uh."
16514700,16514940," Yeah."
16514940,16515180," Yeah."
16515180,16516700," So we'll have to iterate it by indices."
16517340,16517980," So."
16517980,16518700," Um."
16518700,16519020," Let."
16519020,16519580," I."
16519580,16520220," Zero less."
16520220,16520540," N."
16520540,16520780," Plus."
16520780,16521020," Plus."
16521020,16521660," I."
16521660,16523740," And this one is going to be this trail."
16523740,16525020," I."
16525020,16525820," Position."
16525820,16526700," And we use."
16526700,16528860," This trail."
16528860,16529260," I."
16529260,16529580," A."
16529580,16530620," Right."
16530620,16531180," And."
16531180,16532380," Essentially."
16532380,16534220," This entire thing is going to be the following."
16534220,16535020," Uh."
16535020,16537180," We can sort of interpolate it."
16537180,16538140," Uh."
16538140,16538780," We need like."
16538780,16540140," A reverse lerp."
16540140,16540860," I think."
16540860,16541740," We need a reverse lerp."
16541740,16544060," But we can easily do something like I divided by n."
16544060,16545180," Right."
16545180,16547100," Multiply it by I divided by n."
16547100,16548220," So."
16548220,16550140," And it needs to be reversed I think."
16550140,16550540," Right."
16550540,16551180," So."
16551180,16552380," Because it's keep increasing."
16552380,16553660," So we have to do something like."
16553660,16554620," Uh."
16554620,16555740," One minus."
16555740,16556300," This thing."
16556300,16557260," And."
16557260,16557580," Oh."
16557580,16557820," It."
16557820,16558780," It doesn't need to be reversed."
16558780,16559020," Okay."
16559020,16560860," Uh."
16560860,16561100," Okay."
16561100,16563340," So."
16563340,16564620," Something like this."
16564620,16568940," So that's actually pretty cool."
16571740,16572140," Okay."
16572140,16574300," All right."
16574300,16574620," All right."
16574620,16575260," Uh."
16575260,16577420," So."
16577420,16578380," And you know."
16578380,16580620," Actually being able to escape from enemies."
16580620,16581260," Uh."
16581260,16582540," Gives like a whole new."
16582540,16583820," Uh."
16583820,16584140," You know."
16584140,16585900," Mechanic."
16585900,16586300," Okay."
16586300,16586700," Thank you."
16586700,16587020," Uh."
16587020,16588620," Whoever suggested to edit the trail."
16588620,16590140," I think the trail is actually working."
16590140,16590700," If we."
16590700,16592060," If you refine it a little bit."
16592060,16593020," Uh."
16593020,16593740," If you like."
16593740,16594940," Kind of refine it."
16594940,16595500," Uh."
16595500,16596060," Like around."
16596060,16596860," Like the fight."
16596860,16598940," Um."
16598940,16600220," So."
16600220,16601500," I think it's kind of working."
16601740,16603900," Uh."
16603900,16605980," Maybe even four."
16605980,16608140," Uh."
16608140,16623660," Trail initial opacity."
16623660,16624620," Uh."
16624620,16625580," What is it gonna do?"
16625580,16627980," Uh."
16627980,16629260," Class player."
16629260,16630060," What is it gonna do?"
16631580,16631900," So."
16631900,16633420," Opacity."
16633420,16634460," Initial opacity."
16634460,16635260," Initial opacity."
16635260,16635900," Okay."
16635900,16635900," Um."
16635900,16644060," Did it do anything?"
16644060,16646060," It literally didn't do anything."
16646060,16647500," What about like half of it?"
16647500,16652700," Maybe I'm missing something."
16652700,16653340," What about this?"
16653340,16664860," What about this?"
16664860,16671260," That spawning trail."
16671260,16673980," Often would look nicer."
16673980,16678300," Uh."
16678300,16679100," Looks much better."
16681500,16682140," Uh."
16682140,16682380," Okay."
16682380,16684460," So."
16684460,16685660," I think around like two."
16685660,16686220," Was actually."
16686220,16687900," That's it."
16687900,16688140," Yeah."
16688140,16689180," I think something like this."
16689180,16690220," Was actually pretty cool."
16690220,16691740," Uh."
16691740,16692620," Yeah."
16692620,16696140," Yeah."
16696140,16697180," Because there's no indication."
16697180,16697580," Of move."
16697580,16697820," Okay."
16697820,16697980," So."
16697980,16699020," This is a pretty great."
16699020,16699420," Uh."
16699420,16699900," Reference."
16701340,16707180," What if we add the trail to the enemies as well."
16707180,16713340," Uh."
16713340,16714620," That's a very interesting idea."
16720380,16720620," So."
16720620,16721580," But to do that."
16721580,16724140," We need to extract the trail into a separate class."
16724140,16727340," Okay."
16727340,16731420," So."
16731420,16732540," What do we need in the trail?"
16732540,16734620," We need to keep track of this trail."
16734620,16736540," Uh."
16736540,16737580," And."
16737580,16739980," Essentially."
16739980,16741580," Uh."
16741580,16742060," We can."
16742060,16744220," We can update it."
16744220,16744460," Okay."
16744460,16746460," So we definitely need to be able to update it."
16746460,16748300," And we need to be able to render it."
16748300,16749260," Uh."
16749260,16750620," Why the camera and whatnot."
16750620,16752140," Right."
16752140,16752540," And."
16752540,16753180," Uh."
16753180,16754940," We can also push a new."
16754940,16755340," Uh."
16755340,16755980," Position there."
16755980,16757100," Right."
16757100,16758060," Push a new position."
16758060,16759180," And."
16759180,16760540," Let's actually do all of that."
16760540,16760940," So."
16760940,16762060," This is the rendering."
16762060,16762700," Right."
16762700,16764380," This is how we render this trail."
16764380,16765740," But on top of that."
16765740,16766860," We don't have a radius."
16766860,16769500," So we need to keep track of the radius and whatnot."
16769500,16770540," Uh."
16770540,16771420," And I think."
16771420,16773260," It makes sense to do that through a constructor."
16773260,16773980," So it's going to be."
16773980,16775260," A radius."
16775260,16777820," And we're going to set the radius to."
16777820,16779740," This radius."
16779740,16781100," And then."
16781100,16781900," I can use this."
16781900,16783420," Radius."
16783420,16783740," Cool."
16783740,16785500," So."
16785500,16785740," And."
16785740,16786940," Now."
16786940,16788460," It's going to be this trail."
16788460,16788940," Render."
16788940,16790060," Camera."
16790060,16790780," Cool."
16790780,16792140," Uh."
16792140,16793260," So now."
16793260,16794140," In the constructor."
16794140,16794460," This."
16794460,16795420," Uh."
16795420,16795900," Trail."
16795900,16796460," I mean."
16796460,16797500," I can actually construct it."
16797500,16799180," Thank you so much for the subscription."
16799180,16800780," I cannot answer it to you."
16800780,16801420," Thank you so much."
16801420,16802540," Uh."
16802540,16803340," Trail."
16803340,16803980," Is."
16803980,16804540," Uh."
16804540,16805020," Player."
16805020,16805500," Uh."
16805500,16806060," Player."
16806060,16806460," Just."
16806460,16806860," Player."
16806860,16807580," Reduce."
16807580,16809100," Uh."
16809100,16809420," Thank you."
16809420,16809980," Thank you so much."
16809980,16810300," Thank you."
16810300,16810540," Thank you."
16810540,16811260," I really appreciate it."
16811260,16812140," You're very cool."
16812140,16813500," Um."
16813500,16813900," Okay."
16813900,16814540," So."
16814540,16814860," Now."
16814860,16817580," We need to be able to update this entire thing."
16817580,16817820," So."
16817820,16818540," This is what I'm."
16818540,16818940," Uh."
16818940,16819820," Using an update."
16819820,16820940," Uh."
16820940,16821340," Right."
16821340,16821660," So."
16821660,16822460," Yeah."
16822460,16824460," Let's actually push this entire thing here."
16824460,16825500," And."
16825500,16826060," Uh."
16826060,16826860," This is going to be."
16826860,16828300," Wait."
16828300,16829420," I removed update."
16829420,16830220," I removed update."
16830220,16831020," Where is the update?"
16831020,16831740," Where is update?"
16831740,16832460," Where is update?"
16832460,16833660," Where is update?"
16833660,16834860," Here is update."
16834860,16835260," Uh."
16835260,16835900," So that means."
16835900,16837100," This update."
16837100,16838140," Uh."
16838140,16838620," Dt."
16838620,16839900," Trail."
16839900,16841260," Uh."
16841260,16842620," Update trail."
16842620,16845820," And this trail is going to be just push this position."
16845820,16847020," Uh."
16847020,16848540," And that means if I do push."
16848540,16852860," It's going to be this trail push this."
16852860,16853740," Cool."
16853740,16855420," Uh."
16855420,16856380," Not necessarily."
16856380,16856780," Just."
16856780,16857340," Just this."
16859500,16859740," Um."
16859740,16861420," So."
16861420,16861740," Yeah."
16861740,16864380," Now we have a trail as a separate entity."
16864380,16864620," Right."
16864620,16866780," We have a trail as a separate entity."
16866780,16868700," So let's see if it's actually working."
16868700,16869420," It is working."
16869420,16869660," Cool."
16869660,16872380," So now the reason why I want to do it like that."
16872380,16876460," Is because it should be easy to add this trail into the enemy."
16876460,16877260," Right."
16877260,16883100," So we do trail new trail enemy radius."
16883100,16883340," Right."
16883340,16884540," So here's the enemy radius."
16884540,16886620," Every time you update something."
16886620,16888380," So."
16888380,16889500," You push."
16889500,16891980," A position."
16891980,16895340," Into the trail."
16895340,16896540," And also."
16896540,16900700," This trail update dt."
16900700,16902940," Update dt."
16902940,16904380," And then when you render something."
16904380,16905820," You have to do this trail."
16906620,16907420," Uh."
16907420,16907900," Render."
16907900,16909100," Camera."
16909100,16910380," There we go."
16910380,16911420," And actually."
16911420,16912380," In the class."
16912380,16913260," Player."
16913260,16914220," When I render something."
16914220,16914540," I should."
16914540,16914780," Yeah."
16914780,16916300," I render trail behind."
16916300,16916940," Epic."
16916940,16918220," So I have a trail here."
16918220,16918460," And."
16918460,16921020," Uh."
16921020,16921580," Let me see."
16921580,16922860," Oh."
16922860,16923020," Shit."
16923020,16924460," They also have a different color."
16924460,16924860," And also."
16924860,16926060," They move too slow."
16926060,16927180," Yeah."
16927180,16928300," They also move too slow."
16928300,16930140," Uh."
16930140,16930380," Okay."
16930380,16933180," So we also need to customize the trail with the color."
16933180,16934380," So."
16934380,16934860," Uh."
16934860,16935100," Yeah."
16935100,16936060," We also have a color."
16936060,16937180," Uh."
16937180,16937740," Radius."
16937740,16938620," Color."
16938620,16940540," And this one again is going to be color."
16940540,16941020," Color."
16941020,16942300," And now."
16942300,16944140," When I'm setting the color."
16944140,16944540," Right."
16944540,16946140," So it's going to be this color."
16946140,16947100," With alpha."
16947100,16948540," Uh."
16948540,16948940," Trail."
16948940,16949740," Fade out rate."
16949740,16952220," And we also should be able to customize the fade out rate."
16952220,16953820," But that's a completely different story."
16953820,16955020," So trail."
16955020,16955420," Uh."
16955420,16956220," Player radius."
16956220,16957660," And player color."
16957660,16958700," And for the enemy."
16958700,16959100," Class."
16959100,16960220," Enemy."
16960220,16961260," Uh."
16961260,16962700," Is going to be enemy color."
16962700,16963740," There we go."
16963740,16964740," Uh."
16964740,16965100," All right."
16965100,16966300," So now we have that."
16966300,16968940," It moves really, really nicely."
16968940,16970380," And you can barely see it."
16970380,16971020," Actually."
16971020,16972220," You can barely see the."
16972220,16973500," Uh."
16975180,16975820," This thing."
16975820,16976540," So."
16976540,16978460," We also should customize."
16978460,16978860," It's."
16978860,16979420," Uh."
16979420,16979980," Rate."
16979980,16980380," So."
16980380,16981100," Uh."
16981100,16981820," New trail."
16981820,16982860," Uh."
16982860,16983260," Player."
16983260,16984620," Player."
16984620,16986300," Trail."
16986300,16987020," Fade out rate."
16987500,16988300," Um."
16988300,16989500," We can actually call it."
16989500,16990060," I think."
16990060,16990860," Just."
16990860,16991740," Uh."
16991740,16992540," Trail rate."
16992540,16994220," Uh."
16994220,16995020," Trail rate."
16995020,16995260," Cool."
16995260,16997420," Player trail rate."
16997420,16999660," And in another trail."
16999660,17000060," Uh."
17000060,17000540," Enemy."
17000540,17002380," Trail rate."
17002380,17005660," Uh."
17005660,17006140," Enemy."
17006140,17006940," Uh."
17006940,17008860," Trail rate."
17008860,17011740," And in the player trail rate."
17011740,17012460," It's four."
17012460,17013260," And for the."
17013260,17014140," Uh."
17014140,17015580," For the enemy."
17015580,17017180," It should be a little bit slower."
17017180,17017980," It should be a little slower."
17017980,17019340," Because we want to be able to see them."
17019340,17020620," Uh."
17020620,17021180," All right."
17021180,17023340," And in the class trail."
17023340,17024700," In the class trail."
17024700,17025580," Uh."
17025580,17026380," We."
17026380,17027980," Accept the rate."
17027980,17030780," All right."
17030780,17031580," We accept the rate."
17031580,17034220," And we use that rate in here."
17034220,17035820," There we go."
17035820,17037580," Okay."
17037580,17038780," So show me what you've got."
17038780,17039980," Show me what you've got."
17039980,17042300," Okay."
17042300,17042620," That's."
17042620,17043180," That's cool."
17043180,17046460," Okay."
17046700,17047180," So."
17047180,17047740," Uh."
17047740,17048140," Enemy."
17048140,17051100," Trailer rate."
17051100,17051660," Uh."
17051660,17052540," Should be like."
17052540,17053420," Two."
17053420,17054940," Maybe."
17054940,17056700," Maybe the trailer rate."
17056700,17057900," Should depend on the."
17057900,17059100," On the speed."
17059100,17061820," Uh."
17061820,17062460," Two is okay."
17062460,17065340," Two."
17065340,17065900," Two is okay."
17065900,17066300," Actually."
17071340,17072300," What if I make."
17072300,17072300," What if I make."
17072300,17074060," For the player two as well."
17074060,17078380," Nah."
17078380,17079420," Doesn't work."
17079420,17080220," Should be four."
17082300,17082700," Okay."
17082700,17082700," Okay."
17082700,17102940," We're going to have something."
17102940,17103900," For the booth as well."
17103900,17104460," Who knows."
17104460,17117260," So."
17117260,17117740," And what's funny."
17117740,17117980," Is that."
17117980,17118780," You can actually."
17120380,17121660," Try escape them."
17121660,17122460," As much as you."
17122460,17122940," As you can."
17122940,17124060," Right."
17124060,17125180," So."
17125180,17125820," Uh."
17125820,17126060," Now."
17126060,17126860," You have an opportunity."
17126860,17127740," To escape from them."
17127740,17128220," And maybe."
17128220,17129340," Like insane."
17129340,17130220," Spawn rates."
17130220,17131100," Are not."
17131100,17131740," That much."
17131740,17132620," Of a problem anymore."
17132620,17133340," Because you can."
17133340,17134700," Keep escaping them."
17134700,17135920," You can try."
17135920,17136960," Keep escaping them."
17136960,17147680," That was weird."
17147680,17147980," Like."
17147980,17148720," Why did it."
17148720,17149160," Like."
17149160,17155580," Huh."
17155580,17156720," Why is it so slow though?"
17162620,17171820," So."
17171820,17172260," It should."
17172260,17173980," Actually."
17173980,17181340," The trail."
17181340,17183040," Yeah."
17183040,17183940," The trail actually."
17183940,17184460," Yeah."
17184460,17184740," Yeah."
17184740,17185640," Because trail."
17185640,17187680," The way we add to the trail."
17187680,17190020," Does not take into account."
17190020,17190520," The."
17190520,17191560," DT."
17192200,17193000," It just adds it."
17193000,17193640," Every frame."
17193640,17198380," That makes sense."
17198380,17198700," So."
17198700,17199640," The trail needs."
17199640,17200320," Some sort of a cooldown."
17200320,17203220," The trail needs."
17203220,17203800," Some sort of a cooldown."
17203800,17205000," That's why it slows down."
17205000,17205700," I think I found."
17205700,17206580," The problem here."
17206580,17207740," Yeah."
17207740,17208080," So."
17208080,17208500," Let's actually."
17208500,17209360," Quickly do that."
17209360,17209580," So."
17209580,17210120," The trail."
17210120,17211520," Should have."
17211520,17212420," Some sort of a cooldown."
17212420,17215220," So."
17215220,17216620," Cooldown."
17216620,17217780," Is going to be."
17217780,17218340," Initial to zero."
17218340,17218720," Why not?"
17218720,17221300," And."
17221300,17221780," Essentially."
17221780,17222480," If."
17222480,17224440," Cooldown."
17224440,17226960," Is."
17226960,17228300," Less or equal than zero."
17228300,17230160," We pushing."
17230160,17231580," The new position there."
17231580,17233160," And."
17233160,17234200," Resetting cooldown."
17234200,17235240," So."
17235240,17235640," In the cooldown."
17235640,17237060," What should it depend on?"
17237060,17237500," It should."
17237500,17238680," Maybe depend on the rate."
17238680,17239480," Or maybe not."
17239480,17241960," So."
17241960,17244280," We used to edit."
17244280,17245060," Every frame."
17245060,17246020," And we."
17246020,17247440," Worked at 60 FPS."
17247440,17248380," So."
17248460,17248960," That means."
17248960,17248960," That means."
17248960,17250000," The cooldown."
17250000,17250980," Should be."
17250980,17254200," One second."
17254200,17255300," Divided by."
17255300,17256280," 60."
17256280,17256860," Right."
17256860,17257320," One second."
17257320,17258080," Divided by 60."
17258080,17259680," Right."
17259680,17260200," So."
17260200,17261260," That's basically."
17261260,17262060," What it should be then."
17265560,17266160," Because."
17266160,17266740," That's."
17266740,17268060," That exact number."
17268060,17268740," Worked."
17268740,17269840," That exact number."
17269840,17270200," Worked."
17270200,17270500," And when."
17270500,17271660," Every time we update it."
17271660,17273020," We just do."
17273020,17273860," Cooldown."
17273860,17274840," Minus dt."
17275460,17275900," So."
17275900,17276560," Yeah."
17276560,17277160," That's basically."
17277160,17278000," Was the source."
17278000,17279000," Of this entire problem."
17279000,17279440," Hopefully."
17279440,17280480," That will fix it."
17280480,17283480," Okay."
17283480,17283800," So."
17283800,17284320," That."
17284320,17285820," Made."
17285820,17287220," Oh."
17287220,17288280," 60 FPS."
17288280,17288580," Was."
17288580,17289540," Maybe not."
17289540,17295960," You want to take."
17295960,17296820," A high."
17296820,17297580," Frame rate."
17297580,17298020," Screen."
17298020,17298860," Into account."
17298860,17302840," No."
17304000,17304440," Okay."
17304440,17305020," So."
17305020,17306120," Let me see."
17306120,17307580," I'm developing."
17307580,17308240," On my machine."
17308240,17308720," On my machine."
17308720,17309360," I have 60."
17309360,17310260," And on 60."
17310260,17310960," It work okay."
17310960,17311420," That's why."
17311420,17312120," I'm synchronizing."
17312120,17312940," Into 60."
17312940,17313260," So."
17313260,17313920," It will work."
17313920,17314860," As 60."
17314860,17315560," On any machine."
17315560,17316660," Even with a high frame rate."
17316660,17317180," That's the point."
17317180,17318080," Okay."
17318080,17320160," So."
17320160,17320820," It looked good."
17320820,17321300," At 60."
17321300,17321580," So."
17321580,17322020," That's."
17322020,17323060," That's what we're doing here."
17323060,17323900," You."
17323900,17324780," Don't understand."
17324780,17325360," The context."
17325360,17326140," Of what I'm doing here."
17326140,17327200," Essentially."
17327200,17330260," So."
17330260,17330960," Let me think."
17330960,17332080," So."
17332080,17332700," For some reason."
17332700,17333100," Yeah."
17333100,17333600," I need to."
17333720,17334500," Draw."
17334500,17335280," The."
17335280,17336060," The."
17336060,17336660," DT."
17336660,17338880," I need to draw the DT."
17338880,17340080," Console."
17340080,17340700," Log."
17340700,17341740," DT."
17341740,17345120," Yeah."
17345120,17345840," Thank you."
17345840,17346240," Flipcorder."
17346240,17347000," Thank you so much."
17347000,17348700," Because I don't have time to explain."
17348700,17350380," Because I have to think about my own thing."
17350380,17353940," And I have to also explain things to people."
17353940,17355460," Okay."
17355460,17355940," So."
17355940,17357100," Yeah."
17357100,17358180," Sometimes."
17358180,17360060," Yeah."
17360060,17360840," I don't quite understand."
17360840,17361360," So maybe."
17363440,17367400," It's just people heard a keyword."
17367400,17368040," FPS."
17368040,17369400," And they went crazy."
17369400,17369660," Oh."
17369660,17370860," I don't have that FPS."
17370860,17373260," I don't understand the context."
17373260,17373520," But."
17373520,17374020," Whoa."
17374020,17377040," Classic."
17379140,17379500," Okay."
17379500,17379540," Okay."
17379540,17380260," That's."
17380260,17385320," That's classical people."
17385320,17385720," Seriously."
17385720,17389040," They don't try to understand the context of what I'm doing."
17389040,17390500," They just hear the keywords."
17390500,17392300," And they just get triggered at keywords."
17392300,17393120," So."
17393120,17394820," What I'm doing doesn't fucking matter."
17394820,17396360," You said FPS refresh rate."
17396360,17397660," I have a high refresh rate."
17397660,17398540," Re."
17398540,17399660," So."
17399660,17400440," Yeah."
17402320,17403320," Sounds like Twitch."
17403320,17403760," Exactly."
17403760,17408180," All right."
17408180,17408680," So."
17408680,17410060," It's kind of."
17410060,17411000," It's kind of strange."
17411000,17415280," Wait."
17415280,17417080," Oh."
17417080,17418840," And that probably because."
17418840,17420100," What if I make it."
17420100,17421280," 14."
17421280,17421960," For some reason."
17421960,17423960," Yeah."
17423960,17425500," Around something like that was."
17425500,17426320," It looked."
17426320,17427740," Something like that."
17432120,17437420," How many CUDO cores are required to play this game?"
17437420,17438700," I don't even have a CUDO core."
17438700,17441420," I'm playing this game literally on Intel CPU."
17441420,17444660," And I'm also streaming using Intel CPU."
17444660,17448300," Using hardware encoded on Intel CPU."
17448300,17451720," So."
17451720,17453680," I don't know what you're trying to say here."
17453680,17457480," Works fine."
17461920,17462420," Okay."
17490820,17491220," So."
17491220,17494160," I want to wait until it starts like."
17494160,17496900," Spawning like crazy."
17496900,17499360," Maybe since we can move around."
17499360,17502400," Maybe I'm not going to reduce the spawn rate."
17502400,17503500," Because it's kind of."
17503500,17506080," Makes the game a little bit easier."
17506080,17507800," Unless they start spawning behind you."
17507800,17510940," Unless they start spawning behind you."
17510940,17512300," Oh shit."
17512300,17516900," Holy shit."
17516900,17517800," This game is fun."
17520100,17521200," Oh my fucking goodness."
17521200,17522060," This is so fun."
17522060,17524780," Oh fuck."
17524780,17528780," All right."
17528780,17531520," Okay."
17531520,17534200," So I fixed the problem with the stuff."
17534200,17537920," The trails are too fast still."
17541160,17542680," I'm not sure if it trails are."
17542680,17542720," I'm not sure if it trails are."
17542720,17544580," Do we."
17544580,17546740," So we have a trail rate."
17546740,17547220," Right."
17547220,17552620," So when I update everything."
17552620,17553960," Yeah."
17553960,17554680," I'm using DT."
17554680,17555520," I'm using DT."
17555520,17557020," Yes."
17557020,17557820," I'm using everything."
17560320,17560780," and."
17560780,17563160," It's very interesting."
17563160,17566400," It's still."
17566400,17568940," Trails act really weirdly."
17568940,17571180," But yeah."
17571180,17575180," Even though I try to."
17575180,17576300," Take like."
17576300,17578040," Everything into account."
17578040,17579900," Especially when pushing things around."
17581900,17583540," And why when I increase the."
17583540,17584700," Oh yeah."
17584700,17585820," Of course it's not."
17585820,17586740," It's not bad."
17586740,17597760," So."
17597760,17600920," I still kind of."
17600920,17601480," Like."
17601480,17603580," When it worked on 60."
17603820,17605420," Why does it doesn't look."
17605420,17607000," As I want it to look."
17607000,17607360," So."
17607360,17609120," Well."
17609120,17610020," What about this."
17610020,17612720," 120."
17612720,17614860," Well."
17614860,17615420," Yeah."
17615420,17619420," About 44 then."
17619420,17633000," At some point."
17633060,17634500," It just doesn't go any further."
17634500,17635340," So we're going to go."
17635340,17636260," Like around this."
17636260,17637200," So."
17637200,17638360," At 60."
17638360,17639880," It kind of reduces."
17639880,17640860," But at 120."
17640860,17641860," It just doesn't."
17641860,17642220," So."
17642220,17644960," But it's better."
17644960,17645760," For me to."
17645760,17647060," Actually set it to."
17647060,17649220," Something specific."
17649220,17651540," Yeah."
17651540,17651940," I think."
17651940,17652700," 001."
17652700,17653580," Is actually quite good."
17653580,17655180," But on some."
17655180,17656560," On lower refresh rates."
17656560,17657160," It may not."
17657160,17657880," Actually."
17657880,17659740," Work as well."
17659740,17662420," Oh shit."
17662500,17663260," I actually."
17663260,17664260," Switched away."
17664260,17665520," This is not what I wanted."
17665520,17666620," I didn't want to switch away."
17666620,17668000," Notice how."
17668000,17669180," The more."
17669180,17670460," They hit you."
17670460,17672720," The more grayscale shit becomes."
17672720,17673680," Look at that."
17673680,17674660," It loses saturation."
17674660,17675280," Every time."
17675280,17675780," It's hit."
17675780,17676620," It hits you."
17676620,17677720," You lose saturation."
17677720,17678280," And when."
17678420,17679320," The more you kill them."
17679320,17680820," The more saturated it becomes."
17680820,17681920," The saturation."
17681920,17683100," It indicates."
17683100,17684980," The amount of health you have."
17684980,17686240," The less saturation."
17686240,17686840," In the colors."
17686840,17688420," The less health you have."
17688420,17691720," I know that it's probably not suitable."
17691720,17692980," For colorblind people."
17692980,17694080," For some colorblind people."
17694080,17694380," But."
17694380,17697440," This is not like a serious game."
17697520,17698180," Just you know."
17698180,17699860," Exercising in game design."
17699860,17700540," And game development."
17700540,17701640," So."
17701640,17702740," I do acknowledge that."
17702740,17703040," Maybe."
17703040,17704700," Not really suitable for."
17704700,17706460," For colorblind people."
17706460,17707360," So."
17707360,17708520," And I really apologize for that."
17708520,17711780," There we go."
17711780,17715560," Sometimes."
17715560,17716480," Why does it like."
17716480,17717360," Yeah."
17717360,17718140," That's really strange."
17718140,17721360," It just jumps around."
17721360,17722560," For some reason."
17722560,17729000," I think blue will be better."
17729000,17729640," For the color."
17729640,17730400," Since maybe."
17730400,17730840," I don't know."
17730840,17736780," Okay."
17736780,17739900," Does it slow down?"
17739900,17741100," I don't think it slows down."
17741100,17748380," I think it's always the same."
17748380,17749120," If the."
17749120,17750580," Cooldown is less."
17750660,17751400," Because the cooldown."
17751400,17752480," Last only one frame."
17752480,17752680," Yeah."
17752680,17754640," It's true."
17754640,17757680," And that's why."
17757680,17758920," When we slow down."
17758920,17759520," Like this."
17759520,17761280," They become more smooth."
17761280,17763480," And there's more of them."
17763480,17764820," That actually explains everything."
17764820,17766860," So."
17766860,17767340," Maybe."
17767340,17768740," What about."
17768740,17769060," Like."
17769060,17769720," If we."
17769720,17771880," Just make 15."
17771880,17773900," What if we make cooldown 15."
17773900,17775720," And because of that."
17775720,17777160," For."
17777160,17779200," The player."
17779200,17780100," We'll have to."
17780180,17781020," Make it longer."
17781020,17781480," So."
17781480,17781900," Rate."
17781900,17783420," We'll."
17783420,17784320," We'll have to."
17784320,17784840," Like one."
17784840,17787280," Well."
17787280,17788100," That's very interesting."
17788100,17798560," It's a very interesting effect."
17806560,17807560," One over 15."
17807560,17807560," One over 15."
17807560,17807580," One over 15."
17807580,17808720," Or one over 30."
17808720,17809660," What about 30."
17809660,17812420," Yeah."
17812420,17823420," So."
17823420,17825600," It creates an interesting effect."
17825600,17826100," So."
17826100,17827080," That means for the player."
17827080,17829740," For the player."
17829740,17832380," We need a little bit faster situation."
17834380,17834700," Yeah."
17834700,17836980," I think something like that should be okay."
17836980,17838920," So."
17838920,17839660," Around 30."
17839660,17840520," Probably nobody."
17840520,17841820," Nobody gonna have like a."
17841820,17843100," Less than 30."
17843100,17843900," So."
17843900,17844660," That's why we can."
17844660,17845760," More or less say that."
17845760,17846540," It's gonna be predictable."
17846540,17849900," Yeah."
17849900,17852640," So."
17852640,17854240," Can we make it even faster."
17854240,17854840," For the player."
17858040,17858440," Nah."
17858440,17859200," Doesn't make sense."
17859200,17859220," Doesn't make sense."
17888040,17889120," So."
17889120,17891900," Let's wait until the full annihilation."
17914620,17922000," So."
17922000,17923980," The full annihilation is coming."
17923980,17925360," And."
17925360,17926340," Okay."
17926340,17933520," I guess the trails are kind of staying the same."
17933520,17933720," Yeah."
17933720,17933860," Yeah."
17933860,17934040," Okay."
17934040,17935260," So the trails seem to be."
17935260,17936460," Nah."
17936460,17938020," Or do they?"
17941220,17941620," Yeah."
17941620,17944340," Their rate seems to be staying the same around."
17944340,17950100," Yeah."
17950100,17954600," Their rate seems to be staying the same."
17954600,17958380," Sort of."
17967380,17968640," So enemy rate."
17968640,17972940," So."
17972940,17974100," Where is the enemy rate?"
17974100,17975880," Two."
17975880,17978800," And the player one is also true."
17978800,17979380," Two."
17979380,17981580," I'm still thinking."
17981580,17985600," What if I'm."
17985600,17987460," Gonna make it eight."
17987460,17990620," I think it's too much."
17990620,17991960," It makes it invisible."
17996960,18000000," I really don't like the over 30 one."
18000000,18004580," What about over 50?"
18004580,18007060," Yeah."
18007060,18023120," Anabotho."
18023120,18023940," Welcome back."
18026540,18028900," So maybe I'm gonna keep it over 60 then."
18028900,18039520," Around 60."
18039520,18042980," I really liked how it looked like."
18042980,18044420," Like generally."
18044420,18045000," There."
18045000,18046700," I still cannot."
18046700,18049820," Find the look that I'm gonna be satisfied with."
18049820,18051780," I don't know why."
18051780,18053640," This just bothers me so much."
18055440,18056340," Like I cannot."
18056340,18059220," I can't find the trail that would satisfy me."
18059220,18061740," Unfortunately."
18061740,18062700," So."
18062700,18063740," It's kind of."
18063740,18065180," This one is kind of dumb."
18065180,18065500," But."
18065500,18068560," Yeah."
18075960,18100680," It would be kind of cool to actually make it super smooth and stuff like that."
18101640,18102600," But I'm not sure."
18102600,18102600," But I'm not sure."
18102600,18104380," Like cooldown doesn't really work."
18104380,18108500," So the cooldown for 60."
18108500,18110800," Right."
18110800,18115280," To be fair."
18115280,18115760," Maybe."
18115760,18117900," Oh shit."
18117900,18118940," I have an idea actually."
18118940,18121120," I have an idea."
18122400,18123340," So for DT."
18123340,18123380," So for DT."
18123380,18127140," You do cool down."
18127140,18129480," And."
18129480,18131880," Yeah."
18131880,18144820," So here's an idea."
18148820,18151480," You store the previous position."
18151480,18151900," Right."
18151900,18153960," So you pushed one position."
18153960,18155480," And then you look at the."
18155480,18157060," You push the next position."
18157060,18158880," And in update."
18158880,18161800," You divide DT."
18161800,18164320," By the amount of these cooldowns."
18164320,18165280," And you get."
18165280,18167240," Basically amount of steps."
18167240,18167960," Yeah."
18167960,18168260," Yeah."
18168260,18168460," Yeah."
18168460,18168520," Yeah."
18168520,18169940," So essentially."
18169940,18172880," Basically we can try to interpolate this entire shit."
18172880,18174780," Let me try to interpolate it."
18175100,18178420," So this is the position from the previous push into the trail."
18178420,18179740," This is the next one."
18179740,18180580," Then."
18180580,18183780," You can take DT of the frame."
18183780,18185840," And divide it by the cooldowns."
18185840,18186900," And then."
18186900,18188840," You will have amount of steps."
18188840,18191380," To interpolate between previous."
18191380,18193600," And the next push position of the trail."
18193600,18194520," And you can actually."
18194520,18195580," Like fill them in."
18195580,18196660," You see."
18196660,18198460," We can linearly interpolate."
18198460,18199900," The trail."
18199900,18202240," And that way."
18202340,18204000," We can get consistent results."
18204000,18205820," Regardless of the frame rate."
18205820,18207800," Right."
18207800,18209180," Regardless of the frame rate."
18209180,18212180," Ripped FPS."
18212180,18212900," What do you mean?"
18212900,18222120," It just depends on how many of these things you can create."
18222120,18223080," Oh god."
18223080,18226120," Do we really have to explain such basic things?"
18226120,18227760," Probably."
18227760,18229680," Okay."
18231120,18233220," So let's actually extract this entire stuff."
18233220,18234360," So we're going to have a trail."
18234360,18236160," All right."
18236160,18237200," Trail cooldown."
18237200,18237840," Right."
18237840,18238520," Trail."
18238520,18241360," Trail cooldown."
18241360,18244280," So it's going to be 1 over 60."
18244280,18248300," And maybe I can even make it like 1 over 20 or something."
18248300,18249000," Or what not."
18249000,18251380," Right."
18253880,18254880," I never get more."
18254880,18256820," I haven't even pushed the latest version."
18256820,18257540," That's very interesting."
18257540,18258960," So you guys already playing it."
18258960,18264160," Okay."
18264160,18266420," So where's the trail?"
18266420,18267300," Where's the trail?"
18267300,18271040," Okay."
18271040,18271780," So."
18271780,18274340," Here's an interesting thing."
18278100,18278900," Oh fuck."
18278900,18292280," Oh my god."
18292280,18293020," I need water."
18305220,18309120," All right."
18309120,18311460," Oh this one is going to be difficult."
18311460,18312180," It's just."
18312180,18314000," I'm already tired for this thing."
18314000,18317100," All right."
18317100,18318040," I'm going to make a small break."
18318040,18324620," Around 3 minutes."
18325740,18327660," And I'm going to finish it."
18327660,18328240," I want to."
18328240,18330000," I really want to make this trail look good."
18330000,18332220," Trail is probably a way to go."
18332220,18334580," But it's really difficult to make it look good."
18334580,18336920," All right."
18336920,18338160," So let's make a small break."
18338160,18338640," You guys have fun."
18338640,18351040," I'm going to finish it."

18498040,18500040," I'm going to make a small break."
18500040,18502040," I'm going to make a small break."
18502040,18515640," All right, I'm back."
18515640,18521640," Okay, so we need to understand how to make a good trail."
18521640,18523640," How can we make a good trail?"
18523640,18531240," So, we keep pushing positions and stuff like that."
18531240,18535240," We keep pushing positions and we can basically interpolate between them."
18535240,18537240," That could be the way to go."
18537240,18539240," All right, so let me see."
18539240,18542240," Oh, I didn't want to do that."
18542240,18544240," So, here is your positions."
18544240,18548240," You basically put them in several intervals."
18548240,18550840," And what if we just interpolate between them?"
18550840,18552640," How good it's going to look like?"
18552640,18554640," That's a good question."
18554640,18559840," So, and this interval, this specific interval, depends on the FPS, unfortunately."
18559840,18565040," It very much depends on the interface, on the FPS."
18565040,18572040," So, yeah, we can do a thing where we can have regular steps."
18572040,18574040," We can have regular steps."
18574040,18580040," But at higher frame rates, it's just going to, like, at slower frame rates, it's going to become more choppy."
18580040,18582040," It's not fixed yet."
18582040,18583240," It's not fixed yet."
18583240,18595240," So, all right, let me think, like, let me think."
18595240,18599240," Let me think."
18599240,18602440," *Sigh*"
18602440,18604440," *Sigh*"
18604440,18606440," *Sigh*"
18606440,18608440," *Sigh*"
18608440,18621640," *Sigh*"
18621640,18623640," *Sigh*"
18623640,18625640," *Sigh*"
18625640,18626640," *Sigh*"
18626640,18627640," So, we push them..."
18627640,18631640," Oh, by the way, because of that..."
18631640,18633640," *Sigh*"
18633640,18635640," *Sigh*"
18635640,18636640," *Sigh*"
18636640,18637640," *Sigh*"
18637640,18638640," *Sigh*"
18638840,18668820," Where does it pop it from? Last. Okay. JS remove first element. Shift. That makes sense. Removes the first element from the array returns that removed. Okay. So here's an idea. Instead of, since we push them at one end, we always push them at one end. That means here we don't have to do that shit."
18668840,18698660," So we iterate through all of them. And after that, we can just do while trail. This trail length is greater than zero. Right. And this trail zero. This trail zero A is less or equal than zero. And in that case, we're going to do trail shift. So that means we don't have to do this thing here."
18698840,18706840," Because we always push them to from that. And trail always contains the whole like trail thingy. Contains the whole trail thingy."
18706840,18720000," So surprisingly enough, we can always keep a fixed amount of the elements there. We can always keep the fixed amount of elements there."
18720500,18729640," So it could be some sort of like a ring buffer. If you know what I mean. Could be some sort of a ring buffer. And if we're going to do it like in a ring buffer sense."
18730360,18736220," Well, no, no, no, no. Because when it stops, it should also fade away. It should also fade away."
18736220,18744780," Um, so, yeah. So we have this entire thing."
18744780,18758360," Um, so, uh, yeah. Well, by the way, let me, let me just check if this idea will work. It does work."
18758360,18764620," Oh, yeah. By the way, uh, I have a, do I have trail cool down? Yes, I do."
18764620,18768860," Uh-huh. And what is the trail to cool down?"
18768860,18774660," We'll have it in 20. So it should be something around this."
18776280,18778920," Uh-huh. Okay. Class, trail."
18778920,18789640," Circle, radius, alpha, alpha."
18789640,18792920," With alpha."
18792920,18796440," We'll keep pushing things there."
18803880,18826440," What I'm trying to achieve here is maybe just smoothness of this entire thing."
18826440,18832440," Smoothness of this entire thing. And to do that, I just need to interpolate things accordingly."
18832440,18836200," And as I'm interpolating them, right, I have like a bunch of segments."
18836200,18839800," Right. Uh, I have like a bunch of segments."
18839800,18844280," Um, and yeah. So this is the segment."
18844280,18850280," And I need to know the length, the sum of all of these segments."
18850280,18857160," Right. And as I'm interpolating between them, I should decrease the, uh, the thing there."
18859720,18881400," Um, okay, so I, I know it starts becoming really, really boring."
18881400,18883640," So I'm going to just commit whatever I have here."
18884600,18887400," Uh, even though I'm not happy with the final training results."
18887400,18889480," So I'm going to just commit whatever happened."
18889480,18890360," I'm going to call it a day."
18890360,18893080," Uh, I'm going to, I'm going to call it a solution."
18893080,18898280," So let's actually play, uh, until we, uh, reach the annihilation point."
18898280,18900760," The apocalipsis of the, of this thing."
18901800,18904040," Because I cannot contemplate any further."
18904040,18906360," People are just start leaving the stream because it's boring."
18906360,18909960," So, uh, yeah."
18909960,18915960," Maybe I'm going to think, yeah, I can think about it a little bit later."
18915960,18917800," And we can improve details later."
18917800,18920520," Uh, we can always improve them later."
18920520,18935640," So right now it should be okay."
18935640,18943720," Okay."
18950520,18959720," They become a little bit smoother, but not that much."
18959720,18967560," Um, and they definitely don't really kill my entire performance."
18967560,18969960," It's still very much slow."
18974280,18980280," Uh, we might as well actually disable, uh, trails if we're dead."
18980280,18982520," Yeah."
18982520,18983960," I think it's a pretty cool idea."
18983960,18989960," So don't allow pushing if, uh, like to the trails, if we, you are already dead."
18989960,18992360," Uh, how can we actually do that?"
18992360,18998360," How can we put an information about that, uh, to the trails, right?"
19005000,19007880," So we can introduce some sort of a flag into the trail, right?"
19007880,19013320," So class trail, uh, disable, uh, false."
19013320,19014520," All right."
19014520,19026040," And so basically if, uh, not disabled and this, uh, just do that."
19026920,19034120," This disable, disabled, uh, disabled."
19034120,19037000," So if it's not disabled, uh, push."
19037000,19041720," And now, uh, there's a strat that makes you almost immortal."
19041720,19043400," I just died because of a bug."
19043400,19045160," Uh, okay."
19052680,19059400," So when the player dies, by the way, so, uh, player heal, player damage."
19059400,19061320," So this is where we damage the player."
19061320,19063160," Uh, right."
19063160,19073160," And if at some point, if the player, um, health becomes less or equal than zero, right."
19073160,19075640," We need to iterate through all of these things."
19075640,19082840," Let enemy of these enemies, enemies, right."
19082840,19091000," And, uh, we just do enemy, uh, trail, disable, disable, uh, true."
19091000,19095080," And maybe we also want to do the same thing for the, um, for the player."
19095080,19097560," This player disabled, true."
19097560,19101400," So we disabled their trails, uh, right."
19101400,19103800," When you die, right."
19103800,19105400," So the trails get disabled."
19105400,19107320," So they will fade away slowly."
19107320,19109480," Uh, right."
19109480,19110600," So let's continue."
19110600,19115560," Might as well actually, well, yeah, I need to, uh, do the, uh, rate."
19115560,19118840," Uh, rate."
19118840,19121480," Spawn rate."
19121480,19121800," Where is it?"
19121800,19122840," Where is the spawn rate?"
19122840,19123400," Spawn."
19123400,19125560," All right."
19125560,19126840," Oh, I forgot."
19126840,19127800," Where is the spawn rate?"
19127800,19128760," Where's the spawn rate?"
19128760,19129880," Where's the spawn rate?"
19129880,19132760," Oh, here it is."
19132760,19133000," Okay."
19133000,19138760," So let's actually make it insane right away."
19138760,19139560," Come on."
19139560,19140520," Hit me."
19140520,19144760," And yeah."
19144760,19147160," So you still have residual trails."
19147160,19151160," You still have residual trails."
19151160,19153560," And for some reason they're..."
19156040,19161160," Radii don't really increase smoothly."
19161160,19163160," I think I found a bug."
19163160,19163480," Yes."
19163480,19166760," This is not how I want it to be."
19166760,19170600," So when I'm rendering..."
19172760,19173800," Where is the class trail?"
19173800,19177560," Is this effect from..."
19177560,19178760," Another one."
19178760,19179960," We need to create a counter."
19179960,19182520," For Brazilians debated."
19182520,19183960," So, or something."
19183960,19189880," Is that like such a famous meme in Brazil?"
19189880,19190120," Right?"
19190120,19190920," That's..."
19190920,19191800," That's really interesting."
19193000,19194040," Okay."
19194040,19195400," Apparently it's a pretty strong meme."
19195400,19197960," I could imagine..."
19197960,19199000," Yeah."
19199000,19205400," I could imagine this meme being sort of like similar to Jojo to be continued."
19205400,19206360," You know what I mean?"
19206360,19210440," Not really the same meaning, but kind of the same mechanics of the meme."
19210440,19211160," You know what I mean?"
19211160,19211960," Right."
19211960,19213160," So..."
19213160,19214200," Yeah."
19214200,19215400," Probably."
19215400,19215960," I don't know."
19215960,19218200," I'm just guessing because I don't know the Brazilian memes."
19218200,19219880," Anyway."
19219880,19221320," So..."
19221320,19223800," When I'm rendering..."
19223800,19226280," Yeah."
19226280,19233960," Why am I using it like that?"
19233960,19234600," This is dumb."
19234600,19236520," Actually."
19236520,19239080," Why am I using it like that?"
19239080,19240600," Because I could've just done it like that."
19240600,19250600," Okay."
19250600,19252760," All right."
19252760,19267400," Yeah."
19267400,19268600," That's pretty cool."
19268600,19271240," So now they're slowly fading away actually."
19271240,19285960," Which is a little bit better generally, but maybe."
19285960,19292200," Cool."
19294680,19297080," I think it's more or less cool effect."
19297080,19311000," All right."
19311000,19315320," So let me go to the spawn rate."
19317640,19318440," spawn rate."
19318440,19321240," And let's actually set it like this."
19321240,19323960," Okay."
19323960,19325000," So what did we do here?"
19325000,19326200," What I was working on though."
19326200,19327960," So..."
19327960,19329960," Feature complete."
19329960,19331400," Animes are spawned in the screen."
19331400,19333080," Player can easily..."
19333080,19333400," Yeah."
19333400,19334600," We're working on 13."
19334600,19336600," Player can get easily lost outside of the screen."
19336600,19339480," So it cannot get lost anymore."
19340280,19341720," So 13."
19341720,19350040," So I'm about to introduce..."
19350040,19351880," So did we?"
19351880,19353080," Yeah."
19353080,19356600," Introduce camera that follows the player."
19356600,19359960," And I'm going to close 13."
19359960,19360760," All right."
19360760,19362440," I'm going to push that right at the repo and..."
19362440,19363640," Yeah."
19363640,19365560," Feel free to play test it in..."
19366440,19367320," In a couple of minutes."
19367320,19368360," Maybe less than a minute."
19368360,19369320," So..."
19369320,19371320," It actually deploys relatively fast."
19371320,19372520," So we'll see how it goes."
19372520,19376520," So..."
19376520,19377320," And..."
19377320,19378680," Once you see the trails,"
19378680,19379560," let me know if..."
19379560,19381560," You know, if it's playable still."
19381560,19385160," And..."
19385160,19385640," I don't know."
19385640,19386600," Because of the camera,"
19386600,19387560," I'm just afraid that..."
19387560,19389400," Maybe it's not playable anymore or something."
19389400,19399240," So I'm going to keep playing."
19399240,19400440," So I'm..."
19400440,19401560," Any feedback..."
19401560,19403320," After the deployment is actually welcome."
19403320,19411720," Which version is better?"
19411720,19413160," With the camera or without the camera?"
19415160,19423640," Oh, shit."
19423640,19424200," Oh, fuck."
19424200,19424680," Oh, shit."
19424680,19425080," Oh, fuck."
19425080,19426760," Ah!"
19426760,19428840," Okay."
19428840,19433880," And you can find this..."
19433880,19435480," The game deployed here, actually."
19435480,19437240," So, yeah."
19437240,19443800," It's not deployed yet."
19443800,19444040," Okay."
19445800,19446280," Uh..."
19446280,19446680," 13."
19446680,19447080," Not bad."
19447080,19447560," Maybe."
19447560,19448200," I don't know."
19448200,19450280," It's a new version with the camera and stuff."
19450280,19450520," So..."
19450520,19454600," Oh, shit."
19454600,19455560," This is not what that one is."
19455560,19458760," So, excluding..."
19458760,19460920," That one."
19460920,19461640," Let's kill this."
19461640,19463880," All right."
19463880,19464360," It's deployed."
19466520,19468040," So, it should be deployed for me."
19468040,19471240," I mean, it's deployed because it's deployed for me."
19471240,19472680," I don't know what I'm saying."
19472680,19473480," I'm sorry."
19473480,19474280," I'm already tired."
19474280,19479080," Works here."
19479080,19480760," So, is it playable?"
19480760,19481720," How do you like it?"
19481720,19483800," Especially when you die."
19483800,19485960," How is the death animation?"
19485960,19487720," Is the death animation looks okay?"
19487720,19505240," Oh, it's cached for you."
19505240,19505880," And then..."
19505880,19506520," Hmm."
19506520,19508440," It's fine."
19508440,19508920," Okay."
19508920,19514360," So, because the camera may enable more strats."
19514360,19517160," The camera may enable more strats."
19517800,19521480," Because now you'll be able to, like, maybe go away indefinitely."
19521480,19523080," Or something like this."
19523080,19524760," So..."
19524760,19526600," It's updated."
19526600,19526920," Yeah."
19526920,19527800," Now, try to play."
19527800,19528680," Try to play."
19528680,19533720," All right."
19533720,19536600," So, that's..."
19536600,19537320," That's cool."
19537320,19544920," Moving."
19547800,19562520," It's actually super fun."
19562520,19572920," Maybe it should be even slower."
19572920,19574040," That's in any case."
19574040,19577000," So, what else do we have here for the feature complete?"
19577560,19579400," Spawning rate ramps up too quickly."
19579400,19580440," But on the both side that..."
19580440,19585240," She found, like, a strat that makes it..."
19585240,19588360," Basically impossible to die."
19588360,19594280," Maybe because of that strat, I'm not gonna..."
19594280,19596120," Fix this bug."
19596120,19600280," And by the way, sometimes enemies are spawned on the screen."
19600280,19601160," I think it's okay."
19601160,19603400," For them to spawn on the screen."
19603400,19605320," So, basically see them to spawn."
19605880,19609880," I think one way to fix that would be to actually have a spawn animation."
19609880,19610920," Right."
19610920,19612040," So, yeah."
19612040,19616680," Hello, John Ponson."
19616680,19617880," Welcome to the stream."
19620520,19622440," So, I'm gonna create a new issue."
19622440,19623000," I'm gonna create a new issue and..."
19623000,19628360," Anime spawn animation."
19628360,19631480," And it basically should invalidate."
19631480,19636040," Invalidates on screen."
19636040,19638600," Sometimes enemies are spawned on the screen."
19638600,19644520," So, basically, if the enemies have a nice spawn animation, it doesn't really matter if they spawn a screen."
19645080,19648280," Testing right now, the strat still works, but there's so much enemies that it's..."
19648280,19650120," Like, 5 FPS."
19650120,19650680," What the fuck?"
19650680,19651800," Wait!"
19651800,19653640," Is that..."
19653640,19654680," Do you zoom out?"
19654680,19657560," Do you zoom out, like, really far away?"
19657560,19659720," Is that why you have, like, a 5 FPS?"
19662120,19662840," I went from..."
19662840,19676040," No, the zoom is normal."
19676040,19676360," Okay."
19676360,19677320," So..."
19683640,19684200," That, too."
19684200,19686040," I used the zoom maxed out."
19686040,19687160," No, the zoom is normal."
19687160,19688840," It does get very laggy."
19688840,19689080," Okay."
19689080,19691640," So, maybe we'll have to optimize it at some point."
19691640,19694600," I found the strat, too."
19694600,19695800," Oh, okay."
19695800,19699080," Interesting."
19699080,19699480," Okay."
19699480,19700120," That's very cool."
19700120,19702840," Invalidates this thing."
19713480,19726200," Invalidated by 22."
19726200,19729640," And I'm going to just close..."
19729640,19731160," I'm going to mark it as invalid, though."
19731160,19733560," All right."
19733560,19733880," So..."
19733880,19737400," In terms of the features..."
19737400,19739640," It would be nice to know the strat."
19739640,19740200," All right."
19740200,19742280," So, the reason..."
19742280,19747640," The reason why I want to know the strat is because..."
19747640,19751400," Is it worth fixing the spawn rates?"
19751400,19754920," Because maybe if the strat is okay,"
19754920,19757640," maybe we're going to, like, keep the spawn rate the same."
19757640,19761800," And the strat is going to be part of the intended game mechanics."
19761800,19763160," So, what's the strat?"
19763160,19764600," Does anyone can explain?"
19765560,19767800," Because maybe I'm just not going to fix it."
19767800,19768120," So..."
19768120,19779000," Ah, okay."
19779000,19780440," So, I also was thinking about it."
19780440,19781160," I just..."
19781160,19781720," I..."
19781720,19783640," The problem with the strat is that I cannot test it."
19783640,19784520," So..."
19786840,19789080," Because it's going to get very laggy in my machine."
19789080,19794120," Yeah."
19794120,19798920," So, essentially, you move faster than they start spawning."
19798920,19799960," Right?"
19799960,19805400," And basically, you constantly being outside of the circle of them spawning."
19805400,19805800," Right?"
19805800,19809240," Because they spawn around you and they basically make a circle."
19809240,19809800," Right?"
19809800,19811080," So, they basically make a circle."
19811080,19813400," And if you constantly move in one direction."
19813400,19813640," Right?"
19813640,19815160," And also being zoomed out."
19815160,19817800," You basically is on the edge of that circle."
19817800,19818120," Right?"
19818120,19820600," And you can stay alive, essentially."
19820600,19822760," And here's an interesting thing."
19822760,19826280," Because of that, enemies don't really spawn."
19826280,19828680," That's why it gets laggy."
19828680,19832840," That's why it gets laggy."
19832840,19833160," Okay."
19833160,19833720," So..."
19833720,19835080," And it's an interesting thing."
19835080,19837000," So, maybe we should basically..."
19837000,19839320," To fix that, we have to dispawn the enemies."
19840120,19840360," Right."
19840360,19841720," We have to dispawn the enemies."
19841720,19842040," All right."
19842040,19842920," That's an interesting strat."
19842920,19845240," I will think about it and how to fix it."
19845240,19849480," So, if we dispawn the enemies,"
19849480,19852840," so maybe it will not be as laggy as it is right now when we try to do that."
19852840,19855320," But yeah."
19855320,19857560," So, what was that?"
19857560,19859160," Wraiths."
19859160,19861800," Not sure about the Wraiths."
19861800,19865640," So, to be fair, Wraiths might not be the..."
19867240,19870520," Like the blocker of this game being Feature Complete."
19870520,19870840," Okay."
19870840,19874920," I'm going to actually remove this issue from the Feature Completeness."
19874920,19875160," Right?"
19875160,19877560," And I'm going to say..."
19877560,19882040," I'm going to move it to Measure Polish."
19882040,19883000," To Measure Polish."
19883000,19885720," And then I'm going to say that, yeah."
19885720,19888280," We made the game Feature Complete, I think."
19888280,19890040," At least for now."
19890040,19891160," At least for the first release."
19891160,19891320," Right?"
19891320,19892600," So, here's the Feature Complete."
19892600,19896920," And I'm going to close this."
19896920,19897720," How do I close the..."
19897720,19899640," Okay."
19899640,19901240," There's no open issues about the issues."
19901240,19902360," Okay."
19902360,19903400," So, Edit Milestone."
19903400,19904200," I'm going to close it."
19904200,19906920," Close Milestone."
19906920,19907400," There we go."
19907400,19911960," So, when we have Measure Polish that consists of things that, you know,"
19911960,19916360," are not really features of the game per se."
19916360,19916600," Right?"
19919400,19919800," Okay."
19919800,19922200," Oh, we also have Fault."
19922200,19923400," Do you guys know what is Fault?"
19923400,19929240," Basically, if you completely refresh Ctrl+Shift+R, right?"
19929240,19936040," You will see that WSD2Move shows in a different font."
19936040,19938760," And since I'm not a web developer, I didn't know that."
19938760,19941400," Apparently, there is a term for that in web world."
19941400,19942360," It's called Fault."
19942360,19947400," And it stands for Flash of Unstyled Text."
19947960,19953800," So, basically, it's a brief moment of time when the page is showing unstyled text,"
19953800,19955800," because the fonts haven't loaded up yet."
19955800,19960200," And people have written so many articles about fighting the fault."
19960200,19961720," Holy fucking shit."
19961720,19967640," It's like, the web created the whole class of problems that is so difficult to solve, apparently."
19967640,19972360," This is so fucking funny."
19972360,19973480," Oh my god."
19974600,19978920," And one way to fix that, I think, in our case would be to use, maybe,"
19978920,19983080," JavaScriptFaceFontClass, right?"
19983080,19989400," So, basically, load fontFace in JavaScript and then add it."
19989400,19993080," And basically, don't start the game until the font is loaded."
19993080,19997000," And so, that way, we make sure that the font is always there."
19999480,20002360," So, by the way, Anaboth, how is the trail?"
20002360,20007080," Is the trail, you know, looks good on your machine?"
20007080,20013160," Back in the days, it was folk content."
20013160,20013800," Okay, I see."
20013800,20019080," All right."
20019080,20021720," Trail seems okay."
20021720,20021960," Okay."
20021960,20024760," All righty."
20024760,20029880," Well, I think I can say the game is feature complete, sort of."
20029880,20032920," It still requires a little bit of polish and stuff like that,"
20032920,20035400," but I'm not going to do it right now, probably."
20035400,20037160," And I'm not even sure when I'm going to do that,"
20037160,20040200," because it's definitely the last stream of me programming in JavaScript."
20040200,20043480," So, I'm not programming in JavaScript ever again on this channel."
20043480,20044200," I'm really sorry."
20044200,20045560," Feel free to unfollow me and then some."
20045560,20046680," So, yeah."
20046680,20053400," At least I documented the rest of the things that I wanted to fix for this game,"
20053400,20055000," whether I'm going to fix them or not."
20055000,20056200," It's a good question."
20056200,20057880," I don't know."
20057880,20060360," All right."
20060360,20061720," So, that was a fun adventure."
20061720,20065080," And I think we came up with a pretty fun game, not going to lie."
20065080,20066040," Right."
20067560,20072040," Like, re-implementing something like this in C with SDL would be actually super cool,"
20072040,20073080," in my opinion."
20073080,20074280," And it would be even faster."
20074280,20077240," So, the game, if you implement it in C, it would be way faster."
20077240,20081240," And, by the way, in C, you won't be able to zoom out, right?"
20081240,20082840," Because, yeah."
20092520,20093480," Is there a way to..."
20093480,20094440," Probably, I don't know."
20094440,20096280," It's something that needs to be researched."
20096280,20105960," All right."
20105960,20108520," So, that was an interesting adventure, boys and girls."
20108520,20111960," But, unfortunately, it is time for me to go."
20113080,20115000," Thanks, everyone who's watching right now."
20115000,20116280," I really appreciate it."
20116280,20117800," Have a good one."
20117800,20119480," And I see you all tomorrow."
20119480,20124120," So, by the way, you can check out the source code of the project that we developed in here."
20124120,20124360," Right."
20124360,20125400," So, here's the source code."
20125400,20127000," Here is the deployed version."
20127000,20130760," You can play it on your machine just by going to that website."
20130760,20132440," Yeah."
20132440,20137000," Tomorrow, we're probably going to do another kind of game development, but in C++."
20137000,20137800," But I'm not sure."
20138680,20140200," I'm not sure what exactly we're going to do."
20140200,20144760," Also, check out our schedule for more information on different projects we're working."
20144760,20145240," All right."
20145240,20147000," We're working on different projects all the time."
20147000,20152760," Check out our Votes channel, where we upload the recordings of our streams."
20152760,20154680," This stream is going to be there, but tomorrow."
20154680,20159560," By the way, all of the JavaScript streams, all of the two JavaScript streams, are going to be in"
20159560,20161560," the Votes channel on YouTube."
20161560,20164200," And they're going to be in a special playlist."
20164200,20165000," So, yeah."
20165000,20168280," Make sure to subscribe to that channel."
20168280,20172280," And also, check out our Discord server for offline discussion with the community."
20172280,20174680," So, yeah."
20174680,20175960," That's it for today, boys and girls."
20175960,20176680," That's it for today."
20176680,20177400," Thanks, everyone."
20177400,20180120," And I'll see you all tomorrow, hopefully."
20180120,20182120," Love you all."
20198280,20198780," you"
