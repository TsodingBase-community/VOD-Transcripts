1289880,1319860," Thank you."
1319880,1349860," So, it's just, you know,"
1349880,1379860," Perl syntax."
1379860,1409840," view itself, it's a view, you know,"
1409840,1439820," I don't really, you know, I don't want to think, you know, I don't want to think, you know,"
1439820,1445660," and a special case uh for this situation i completely forgot about that so all right so"
1445660,1452140," let's go ahead and do that super quick so uh here's the assets here's we uh skipping empty line"
1452140,1457180," skip empty lines and another one is gonna be"
1457180,1465100," lines data equal hash continue"
1467100,1471180," skip single line comments all right"
1471180,1480060," those who understand rejects have the power the power of what the you mean the electricity"
1480060,1483180," i i do have electricity and i do understand"
1483180,1493100," all right rejects are relatively simple i do agree with that uh if you're not using like super"
1493100,1495100," complicated stop"
1495100,1507020," wouldn't that just keep uh lines that only have single no because we're looking at the first character"
1507020,1518860," here uh because we're looking at the first character here uh all right so uh skip single lines and um all right"
1520380,1522380," so"
1522380,1534060," so i chop by this thing and this gives me uh-huh so then i have equals and throw that part away"
1534060,1545340," oh boy throw that part away and uh maybe here i don't really want to trim anything and what i want to do"
1545340,1553500," here is basically chop by delim like this uh you know what i'm not gonna do that i'm gonna just"
1554460,1558700," let it be like let it be like that and we're gonna test this kind of thing separately hello upon the"
1558700,1566060," podio welcome to the stream welcome book uh all right let's recompile everything something debug"
1569500,1573500," so uh yeah i don't need to have that anymore"
1573500,1583660," all right so could not load"
1583660,1594540," space as png so as obviously forgot to trim something uh i wonder where it should be yeah i mean i literally"
1594540,1598060," deleted the trim and now jesus christ what the fuck is going on with this today"
1598060,1603740," all right so uh i need to concentrate i need to concentrate"
1603740,1608780," all right so there we go everything seems to be working quite well"
1608780,1614460," uh and we do have support for a single line comments and the only thing we need to add here"
1614460,1620380," is the the comments on the same line this is another comment there we go"
1622140,1628060," oh it's actually quite warm today yes uh i've been outside uh right before the stream because i need"
1628060,1635980," you to buy some chocolate um yeah i can't stream without the chocolate i had to actually buy chocolate"
1635980,1641580," right before the stream all right so and here's the problem right so it tries to load this entire thing"
1641580,1648700," as the path and this is something that we have to uh we have to properly fix yes dark chocolate the 97"
1648700,1657980," one um yeah i need that dopamine kick to stream i think i'm getting addicted to chocolate it's actually"
1657980,1665340," quite interesting uh all right so here's the line uh i chop body limiter like this basically skipping"
1665340,1674620," the rest of the stuff uh the rest of the stuff uh and this stuff can be i suppose uh shop by delim"
1674620,1682700," there we go outside weird champ like i have a store right across the road so it's not that"
1682700,1691260," you know it's not that i'm spreading too much of a of a corona and stuff uh so yeah there we go we have"
1691260,1696620," support for both of the style of the comments and that's actually pretty cool that is actually pretty"
1696620,1703980," cool uh let's do a committee committee and maybe then even a pushy pushy i have a tea store right"
1703980,1713820," across the the road oh so and that's the only thing you can buy so yeah i always thought programmers do"
1713820,1720540," streams from a swimming pool and their villa disappointing uh sorry um i'm not a programmer"
1720540,1727180," though so that's probably why um all right so let's do committee committee before we do committee committee"
1727180,1736140," let's actually create a separate branch let's create a separate branch um it's going to be 251 uh 251"
1737100,1748540," uh and uh add support for the comments in uh assets conf there we go so now we have support for all of"
1748540,1760380," that i'm going to push that right into the repo um yep i only want to see um okay let's create a pull request"
1760380,1769900," guys boys and girls let's create a pull request"
1769900,1784460," um wait a second did i i forgot to oh no no no no no no no i forgot to actually mention the issue"
1787820,1793740," i forgot to actually do this kind of thing so i have to uh you know amend my comment and"
1793740,1802380," unfortunately force push into into the reaper yes force push is required so it's just a regular push"
1802380,1811260," but with a with a little bit of force you know to get it through uh to get it through"
1817820,1828780," okay and we're going to close that thing uh we're going to quickly close that thing so the next issue"
1828780,1834300," is going to be really interesting and it's something that i wanted to do for quite some time but because"
1834300,1843580," we didn't have a centralized asset system i couldn't do that so i want to uh be able to hot reload the assets"
1844700,1853500," and that will enable such a cool um workflows right so it's essentially right uh i want to be able to"
1853500,1862140," open um image in for example a surprise modify it draw it while the game is running and while the game is"
1862140,1868060," running reload that assets that i just modified just to see instantly how it looks like in the game"
1868860,1873740," you see what i'm talking about it's like a variable config reloading but for the textures"
1873740,1880460," sounds and uh animations and stuff like that just you know uh reload in the runtime i really wanted to"
1880460,1886780," have that i think it would have improved my workflow tremendously uh but i couldn't do that again"
1886780,1892700," because i didn't have a centralized place uh um where the assets are queried and stuff like that and"
1892700,1897180," now we do have it and i think it would be super easy to implement something like that and this is"
1897180,1905420," what i want to stop working today um all right so uh yeah we're waiting for the continuous integration"
1905420,1905740," step"
1905740,1914700," do you have a separate compiled yes i do have a separate compiled there we go here it is i compiled"
1914700,1920300," it actually quite some time ago i'm pretty sure it's already old but recompile compiling nasi pride is"
1920300,1927340," such a pain in the ass so i don't really do that often maybe it is intentional so people buy it instead"
1927340,1935340," of compiling from scratch so yeah what's funny is that it's it's a pain in the ass to compile it on linux"
1935340,1940620," but i cannot imagine imagine how much of a pain in the ass it is to compile it on windows and i'm pretty"
1940620,1946620," sure all of the windows users of this program just buy it because i mean compiling that um"
1946620,1956140," you still can compile it yeah so there's some problem uh because it cannot find something i"
1956140,1963260," don't remember how i solve that problem so essentially i ended up like downloading like"
1963260,1969980," pre-built binaries of some library putting them in some weird place and targeting"
1969980,1976060," c make there just to compile some sort of dependency that is needed for us right it's such a pain in the"
1976060,1981900," ass and i wonder if it's really intentional to sort of like force people to buy this program it's kind"
1981900,1987580," of interesting uh but yeah i mean it's it's their program so they can do whatever the they want"
1994620,1999900," oh skia yes thank you free fall thank you so much yeah it's something about skia i vaguely remember"
1999900,2005500," like i built it a long time ago but i don't remember what exactly i had to do to properly build it and"
2005500,2012780," since then i didn't touch it like you know if it's working don't touch it so yeah um you also compile some"
2012780,2019260," other tool using the skia fork yeah so it's kind of weird and this is because they were trying to fix some"
2019260,2031580," problem or something like it's it's kind of weird um okay we're done cheers by the way congratulations on"
2031580,2042140," on a successfully build ci"
2042140,2047180," merge pull request confirm merge"
2047180,2053580," my problem was that even though i compiled everything as they said in the installation"
2053580,2058540," instruction it still failed with the linker error oh so you give up i see"
2060060,2065900," i wish it actually i could help to build it but unfortunately i just don't remember how i did that"
2065900,2071340," it's one of these things that you sort of like fix once and never touch it and then forget how you did"
2071340,2076780," that so and i think i didn't even keep any notes on how to fix that which is actually kind of mistake"
2076780,2082060," because i'm pretty sure i'll need those notes later when i decide to rebuild all that so yeah"
2082060,2089980," uh but until then i have a work in a separate which is cool anyways so let's go back to the board let's go"
2089980,2095820," back to the board um i like recompile on the bs with nv encoded support"
2095820,2106220," hmm interesting i only compiled with va api all right so there is no way to reload assets at runtime"
2106220,2113900," let's see how we can do that let's see how we can do that so i'm gonna go to the master i'm gonna fetch all of the latest stuff"
2113900,2122380," uh and merge origin master and remove all that let's create separate bridge excuse me"
2122380,2133340," um and let's create separate batch for two five two and uh let's find the asset manager i don't really"
2133340,2137180," like to call it asset manager but it's the entity that manages the assets"
2138540,2144220," search um okay so this one is interesting so here we're loading config"
2144220,2153100," and i wonder i wonder can we have something like reload config so is there any difference between"
2153100,2162300," loading config and reloading config i think there is i think there is there there are because when you're"
2162300,2169420," reloading config you also have to uh release all of the allocated resources before loading new resources"
2169420,2173260," so that's that that could be a problem uh"
2175100,2178780," yeah so let me think how we can do all of that so i need to implement"
2178780,2187420," release uh maybe clean clear right i think it's usually called clean so we need a method that will"
2187420,2194540," actually clean uh the whole assets entity right so it will deallocate all of the textures here"
2194540,2199580," uh then it will set textures count to zero then deallocate all of the sounds here and then deallocate"
2199580,2205820," all of the frames and if suppose we can just call this function uh once inside of the load config and"
2205820,2211340," load config essentially is going to act like a reloading function and if you don't have any assets"
2211340,2217260," loaded clean is not going to do anything so yeah essentially you can just use load as the reload"
2217260,2222060," maybe we can even call it reload right so it's a super similar situation to the config variables and"
2222060,2227100," i wonder if we can reuse a lot of config variables a code and logic to do this kind of stuff"
2228220,2239260," uh all right so assets assets dot cpp yes there we go and there we go"
2239260,2253820," clean uh so what essentially we're gonna do uh is iterate over the texture all right it's gonna be"
2253820,2261500," something like this texture count plus plus i is it texture count or textures count i think it's"
2261500,2268140," textures count so when essentially what i need to do here i need to clean all of these things here"
2268140,2275660," and i think it should be pretty straightforward i think we just have sdl uh destroy uh destroy texture"
2277580,2284940," are you guys talking about some weird kinky oh yeah we're talking about using h for c plus plus that"
2284940,2295180," is weird and kinky and i like it yeah yeah um all right so yeah so there's a sdl destroy the texture"
2295180,2298860," and there should be also sdl destroy uh destroy surface"
2303180,2309260," it's actually it's actually free surface is it really is it really is it really so there is a"
2309260,2314700," destroyed texture but there is free surface what's up with that actually"
2314700,2325180," what's up with that it's kind of weird don't you think that uh yeah the thing that i think we"
2325180,2329820," already talked that the thing that just like you know deallocates texture is called destroy but the"
2329820,2336700," thing that uh deallocates surface is called free um maybe it has something to do with that uh with"
2336700,2345260," the fact that surface is on cpu usually um right and texture is usually on gpu it depends on the um"
2345260,2352060," it depends on the driver that is the reason but usually it is like that"
2353340,2359980," this deal is strictly 2d right well it is kind of 2d but you can use sdl as a cross-platform"
2359980,2370380," initializer for the uh opengl and in that case you can use sdl and do 3d um 3d graphics you can do"
2370380,2370940," things like that"
2370940,2379020," so but since i'm not using sdl as a cross-platform opengl initializer"
2379020,2387180," it is strictly 2d for me right so that's pretty much the situation uh all right so i'm iterating"
2387180,2391820," the textures and what essentially i'm gonna do i'm gonna just uh you know deallocate all of this stuff"
2391820,2402940," so um i have an idea i have a pretty epic idea chat uh you're gonna you're gonna love it i think"
2402940,2409580," i'm gonna use an emacs magic look look look look look i'm gonna replace this thing with that and then"
2409580,2417180," uh for the surfaces i'm gonna do free surface for the textures i'm gonna do destroy texture"
2417180,2425900," and there you go isn't that epic i think it's pretty epic actually emacs magic can your vim do that"
2428300,2434060," uh all right so when we have textures and actually actually actually have to also prefix all of that"
2434060,2441420," with special stuff stop sorting my vim square i'm sorry i didn't want to uh you know upset you vim"
2441420,2449500," so everything's gonna be okay i mean vim is also extendable editor right uh vim was also extendable"
2449500,2455580," editor so with a little bit of you know that weird vim script you can make it work sure you can make"
2455580,2462140," anything work in vim with a little bit of loop and vim script so yeah don't worry about that"
2462140,2469740," joe is also extensible is it extensible i mean it's open source you can literally modify this"
2469740,2470860," the code source i suppose"
2479980,2483740," all right anything extensible if it's open source am i right"
2483740,2495020," all right and after that after we allocated all of the textures right uh we're going to uh just set the"
2495020,2501900," textures count to zero indicating that the resources has been freed uh and let's see if it's going to"
2501900,2513660," a compile or not probably not because me"
2513660,2523660," all right so this is only textures now we need to deallocate the uh sounds right"
2526620,2538860," um"
2538860,2551580," all right how do we load uh sounds by the way i think it's load sample yeah it's a load sound and then we"
2551580,2559180," do load wave as sample s16 and if i look inside of this entire stuff how do we allocate any memory"
2559180,2565900," for it do i even allocate any memory i didn't think i allocate any memory"
2565900,2574620," oh that's very interesting okay so as the load wave allocates all of the unnecessary memory here"
2575260,2586300," all right um yeah you have to provide the pointer to the buffer so it will allocate it for you so and"
2586300,2597740," then you will have to free it accordingly i see i see that makes sense um okay so so hpp um yeah"
2600860,2608460," assets after that i'm gonna iterate through all of this stuff"
2608460,2615260," sounds count once for sign sdl3"
2615260,2625820," sounds i unwrap and uh we'll have to do the thing for the buffer so it's going to be audio"
2626540,2634060," audio buff and after that i'll have to send the sound count to zero all right let's try to compile"
2634060,2635980," all of that and see if it works or not"
2635980,2638540," uh"
2638540,2648300," uh that's really strange okay wait a second free buff all right so what are you complaining about"
2649260,2659420," oh okay so it's supposed to be uint8 but my pointer is actually u816 and why is it u816"
2659420,2662780," why is it u816"
2662780,2667260," um let me find the sounds and stuff"
2670060,2678620," uh yeah okay so we actually explicitly cast it okay that's very interesting well i suppose i can"
2678620,2685660," do it like that i can explicitly just to sort of like uh type on it into that to to make it free and"
2685660,2692460," stuff like that okay so sounds sounds good all right so we cleaned all of the um all of the sound"
2692460,2700860," resources now we need to clean all of the animat resources uh right all of the animat resources"
2712620,2723900," mats count plus plus i so let's take a look at the frame animat um"
2723900,2733500," i think it's something with sprites"
2733500,2740780," frame animat so the only thing that we're allocating here when we're loading the frame animat is probably"
2740780,2745020," uh this sequence of sprites right and nothing else"
2745020,2750780," um and i suppose where do we allocate them i don't quite know where we allocate them to be fair"
2750780,2755980," so load animat so this is a load animat"
2755980,2761180," uh this is a load animat"
2761180,2763340," okay"
2769260,2770700," i'm not quite sure to be fair"
2770700,2778620," so where's the count okay so when i once i give have count okay so we're using new"
2778620,2783740," here so i'll have to use delete accordingly all right um"
2783740,2787420," clean"
2789820,2796220," so we'll have to delete uh any mods right unwrap"
2796220,2800620," frames"
2800620,2809100," any mods uh count equals zero"
2816620,2822220," all right all right so and let's try to run that and see if it works okay i didn't break anything"
2822220,2825340," but i never actually called the code that i implemented"
2825340,2833100," it's kind of difficult to break anything if you never actually run the code that you just implemented"
2833100,2839260," right so yeah so let's let's actually try to run uh what we what we implemented and maybe that will"
2839260,2845740," actually break it right before uh loading configuration we just do a clean right we just do a simple clean"
2845740,2849100," here and uh let's see what how it's gonna go"
2849100,2851340," um"
2851340,2853420," all right"
2853420,2858300," so and everything seems to be okay"
2860780,2868220," uh everything seems to be okay dokey karaoke so the idea is going to be super simple we're gonna"
2868220,2876220," assign load config asset load config to some sort of a key right so let's actually go to the game"
2876220,2883660," uh let's do let's go to the game so game is cpp and there should be something like handle uh handle"
2883660,2890140," events there yeah there you go we're handling events and when we're pressing f5 we reloading"
2890140,2897020," we're reloading the config so what we're gonna press to reload the assets that's a good question"
2897020,2901180," so let's me let me uh do the following thing"
2901180,2903340," f6"
2903340,2912940," racket people are so pepego why so what's wrong with them"
2912940,2916220," actually i know nothing about racket community so"
2917180,2923020," yeah the only thing i know that they're into like cs education a lot and this entire language is"
2923020,2926780," designed for cs education so what's all about it"
2936060,2943660," so in this thing wait a second it's interesting in this in the elements of the array created and"
2943660,2949660," untyped racket is currently 25 50 percent time 50 times slower than doing that in the typed due to"
2949660,2958460," the overhead of checking over the contracts we're working on it that's funny actually well if you think"
2958460,2965260," about it it is actually true for any interpreted language right in any interpreted language uh when"
2965260,2971900," you're iterating an array uh you need to check the types but not necessarily if you have like a jit"
2971900,2976780," compiled language it just compiles that chunk of code once and it never have to check anything"
2976780,2988060," anymore i suppose i don't know uh it's kind of funny but yeah i suppose tip typed uh typed uh racket"
2988060,2994300," basically checks the types once and strips of the contracts uh and that's why it's faster well i mean"
2994300,3000780," that's what that's exactly what they say there at least uh interesting um all right so what we're"
3000780,3005820," going to do here it's going to be load and uh how do i call load by the way so it's going to be assets"
3005820,3014460," load um and we need a renderer we need a renderer here so that's what we'll have to do here all"
3014460,3023500," right so maybe we also need to uh sort of flash some sort of a message uh flash some sort of a message"
3023500,3035980," that we reloaded this entire thing um all right"
3035980,3047500," why uh wow a separate compile so slow it is actually pretty slow because it compiles all of the dependencies"
3047500,3063980," hello vv1 zm8 welcome welcome to the stream"
3063980,3073340," well racket for sure the thing about racket is that it has a like a pretty big community around it that"
3073340,3080700," contribute a lot of uh documentation tutorials third party dependencies it even has a pretty cool ide so"
3080700,3087500," for learning this racket is actually super cool um so and it's definitely better than than any other"
3087500,3093980," implementation of scheme and as far as i know racket initially was like a specific specification"
3093980,3099660," compliant and will be in the implementation of scheme but it actually grew out of the scope of the scheme but it"
3099660,3107900," still supports uh majority of the scheme specs so um yeah so by learning racket you're pretty much"
3107900,3113500," learning scheme as well but racket itself is actually much more than scheme um"
3117580,3123100," hello welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome uh so yeah"
3123100,3132460," all right um so we need to i think i want to actually flash some sort of a"
3132460,3137100," message that we reloaded this entire thing but i don't remember how to do that i'm sorry"
3137980,3145740," so i'll have to go to the command reload and uh yeah this is how we do that uh okay so there we go"
3145740,3154700," so we reload this thing and then it's a pop-up notify font success color reloaded assets right"
3154700,3158300," it actually depends"
3158300,3164780," so right now if reloading the assets fails the entire application will just crash"
3165340,3170460," right but uh maybe we're gonna uh try to handle that a little bit uh differently later so i don't"
3170460,3176300," think it's that important right now what's up to go beat welcome to the stream um all right"
3176300,3183900," okay so load the conf that's what we're doing um"
3183900,3188860," renderer and we don't have a renderer inside of the game really"
3190380,3194060," oh this is actually super bad um"
3194060,3199820," i need the renderer there to be able to reload the configs"
3199820,3203340," maybe because of that i'll have to move"
3203340,3209020," this code outside of the game it feels like this is something that we'll have to do"
3209020,3215820," it feels like this is something that we'll have to do"
3215820,3227260," all right so we have a key down simulation delta um all right let's actually put it here somewhere i"
3227260,3235020," think it's not a bad place for that thing to uh to have and um that means assets is that and then we'll"
3235020,3241900," have to do a game uh not sure if the assets have to be part of the game though i kind of i kind of"
3241900,3247500," want them to be available for everyone at any point but uh yeah we'll see so here's the config"
3247500,3250460," and here's the assets and after reloading the assets"
3250460,3257020," was it was it too loud i hope i heard was not too loud but what the"
3257020,3271340," okay so that's that was scary so we messed up reloading the the assets that's for sure"
3272860,3275100," but we're getting there i suppose"
3275100,3281020," um"
3281020,3288380," all righty all righty all righty so uh"
3288380,3297980," it clipped not too loud okay so actually bring the sound down a little bit i suppose something"
3297980,3301660," corrupted the assets uh something definitely corrupted them"
3301660,3304380," um"
3304380,3308060," assets cpp"
3308060,3312860," so we're essentially doing here we're just destroying all of that"
3312860,3316300," and why would it be like that it's so weird"
3316300,3319260," why would it even be like that"
3323420,3328620," can you pause the renderer and sound stuff until you reload the assets"
3328620,3334380," it's a good question i have no idea"
3334380,3343580," maybe we should try to learn how to reload only the"
3347100,3353900," oh that's actually a good point yes i need to wait until the all of the sounds finished loading and stuff like that"
3353900,3368780," that's what needs to be happen"
3376140,3380300," so can we do something interesting can we not clean the sound at all"
3380300,3386060," but i also want to be able to load the sound"
3386060,3389340," you know what"
3389340,3391020," um"
3391020,3399100," yeah i want to reload only like very specific things"
3399100,3404940," but i want to also load the sounds once right so that's quite kind of interesting"
3405420,3408300," so maybe i'm gonna make a simple hack"
3408300,3412780," um very simple hack uh what is that"
3412780,3415500," is that something important"
3415500,3421820," oh you managed to build it congratulations did you build it on uh on freebie z"
3421820,3427420," that's super cool congrats congrats that's actually super cool"
3428540,3431100," yeah yeah was it too difficult"
3431100,3438140," and for busy nice nice nice nice nice is it in freebie z ports or something"
3438140,3443580," or do did you okay so all right"
3449900,3454940," it's on windows it's on windows i see it's in the ports okay i see as far as i know the ports don't"
3454940,3461260," really violate the asset right license because you're still building it yourself right so uh"
3461260,3468460," distributing these scripts uh that help you build a surprise as far as i know does not violate the the"
3468460,3476780," license so it's perfectly fine in such systems as freebsd again to nixos and stuff like that and also our i suppose"
3477500,3484940," um yeah because you still build it yourself so it doesn't really matter um so the point of the slide"
3484940,3494140," sense is to rise the awareness right that uh to not you know send issues that were introduced by the"
3494140,3499580," distro right so because that was the main point because such distros as debian and ubuntu"
3500220,3506140," overpatched this program and uh introduced the bugs that were reported back to the asaprite but asaprite"
3506140,3509260," developers had nothing to do with that so yeah"
3509260,3524700," but very old version and by the way are you using arch because i thought you're using gento"
3524700,3529100," or gentle i don't i don't remember how it's pronounced but i mean yeah"
3529100,3538700," i thought you were kind of person did you switch to arch uh i think there is something about memory"
3538700,3543180," that most people don't understand erlang go and rust oh my god that's a very long message"
3543820,3548700," i have simple memory models which makes them unusable in multi-core context and you're"
3548700,3555980," i'm not sure i okay probably a lot of people don't understand things sure"
3557660,3569500," um"
3587660,3615020," i need to i need to have a boolean variable i need to have a boolean variable"
3617660,3625660," the sdl renderer run in a different thread uh i don't think so i think it has something to do"
3625660,3627980," with the sound sound probably runs in a different thread"
3627980,3637900," load it for loaded first time this is what we're gonna call it right loaded first time initially it's"
3637900,3651900," going to be zero let me show it's going to be zero"
3651900,3663580," so essentially uh if"
3667900,3670140," if loaded"
3670140,3675180," first time"
3675180,3681020," we're not going to load the sound right i'm not going to load the sound"
3681020,3685180," and uh if loaded the first time"
3691340,3696220," we're not going to do that and uh after below did everything"
3696220,3705500," i'm going to do true here so initially it's going to be false hopefully and then we'll see"
3705500,3707420," we'll see how it goes"
3715180,3720220," could not uh find sound peel sound that's really weird um"
3720220,3727500," so initially oh okay if it's not all right if it's not i'm sorry it has to be if it's not"
3727500,3729820," so there we go if it's not"
3737100,3744140," all right all right so and hopefully if i try to reload now it's not going to be too loud all right"
3744140,3754700," so i can kind of see that the problem is probably with oh okay so i'm sorry i'm an idiot yeah"
3756380,3763980," so the problem is also with the textures right uh the problem is also with the textures thank you by"
3763980,3767580," xxxx welcome to the stream by the way um"
3767580,3777180," so i wonder what what exactly wrong with the textures though"
3777900,3785580," right what exactly wrong with them because i just cleaned them up um and that should be enough i suppose"
3785580,3787260," um"
3787260,3797500," because we're referring to the textures using their index so maybe it that's what has something to do"
3797500,3805100," with that right maybe that's what's it's all about it's kind of it's kind of strange to be fair"
3807340,3817660," it's kind of strange to be firm"
3836780,3845260," so what's funny is that"
3845260,3850140," it fucked up the textures of"
3850140,3855900," the players and stuff and i wonder why"
3855900,3859660," i wonder why it fucked them up"
3861660,3866060," yeah yeah uh so let's actually take a look at the entities then"
3866060,3868140," entity"
3868140,3874380," oh i have an interesting idea i have an interesting idea"
3874380,3875580," um"
3875580,3883900," so if i reload the textures and then i reload the thing it works now okay"
3885660,3894460," that is very interesting so essentially it probably stores stores the pointer to the previous texture"
3894460,3900060," that is long time gone and that's what we'll have to fix now that we'll have to fix"
3900060,3905580," interesting i wonder what would be the easiest way to approach that but"
3906300,3918620," don't we store it by an index or does it modify the index this is actually kind of interesting"
3918620,3933100," so if i don't know what's the second one is to do map yeah"
3933100,3937580," so if i don't know what's the first one is to do map yeah"
3937580,3939580," hmm"
3939580,3952060," hmm hmm"
3952060,3956060," hmm hmm"
3956060,3968540," hmm"
3968540,3974860," and also we have like a okay so i need to go to the integers uh integers"
3976940,3990060," let's go to need to go to the integers"
3990060,4000540," and just state and uh it has to do it has to do something with the frame on your mats i think"
4001580,4008220," right so frame a new mat uh struct this would be"
4008220,4022220," why are you not loading dll dot is so hot reloading because i didn't implement it probably that's why"
4022220,4026300," uh that's probably why"
4028700,4034140," so to defer i actually stole that code from the reddit so that's it's the name that was given there"
4034140,4035180," so"
4035180,4036700," sorry"
4036700,4042780," actually"
4042780,4045180," believe it or not"
4045180,4048140," it has nothing to do with textures"
4048140,4051740," i think it has something to do with the animations"
4051740,4055900," yes i think it has something to do with the animations i think i figured it out"
4056700,4061420," all right so we can actually do something similar essentially we do not reload"
4061420,4065020," uh the animations so it's going to be loaded"
4065020,4069340," first time if it's not loaded first time we're gonna just do it like that"
4078940,4093420," load it so it definitely has something to do with the animations and now if i reload it"
4093420,4099260," yeah there we go it doesn't break anything i reload the assets and it doesn't break anything and"
4099260,4104620," let me show you what i mean when i was talking about hot reloading the assets and stuff like that"
4105180,4109740," so essentially i want to have the following workflow where i can just open some of these"
4109740,4117660," things like ice right and can i modify something like for example change the the color right maybe"
4117660,4123420," maybe i can add additional thing here i'm gonna save that thing and i'm gonna go to the game and i'm"
4123420,4132380," gonna reload and here it is it appeared here as i drew it uh then i can do ctrl z save it again and"
4132380,4140940," it's actually back to to normal thing so essentially i can draw while the game is running and then make the"
4140940,4148300," game reload the assets um so and instantly see how it's gonna look like right i think it's actually super"
4148300,4156620," cool and this is exactly what i was okay so something actually went horribly wrong but yeah so uh let me"
4156620,4163340," let me try the following thing i'm gonna add like a bunch of ice blocks and we can start like modifying"
4163340,4171580," them uh maybe we're gonna change a little bit of color we can add uh some stuff here probably uh it has to be"
4172300,4181020," like here right it has to be like here gonna save it and i really like how it's instantly just applies"
4181020,4191420," it for everything just yeah it's pretty cool all right but that only works for uh"
4194940,4204140," that only works for the textures it doesn't work for for the sounds and animations because i'm not"
4204140,4209420," being super careful about how i manage memory for the animations and for the sounds"
4209420,4216620," can you auto reload when any of the files in assets folder has changed yes i can"
4217580,4225180," but that needs to be implemented right so let's not jump ahead of ourselves right let's implement"
4225180,4233020," everything properly without any bugs and then we can have nice features all right so so the answer to"
4233020,4239580," your question it's not finished yet the reason why we don't do that it's not finished all right uh"
4239580,4246300," once it's finished it's gonna be it's gonna be pretty cool because we do have auto reloading for"
4246300,4254620," um variables uh different kind of variables because uh you can have a file uh like this let me actually"
4254620,4263180," find vars config uh and you can modify something here and uh it will automatically detect that uh for"
4263180,4269980," example one of the things i can do essentially is uh change the um the background and as you can see"
4269980,4275020," the background automatically changed after me modifying the file but this is a completely different mechanism"
4275020,4280620," it has nothing to do with the assets it's just you know variables like values that are used at the"
4280620,4287340," runtime in the program uh for the assets we'll have to implement that separately right for the assets"
4287340,4293020," the assets we'll have to implement that separate one"
4293020,4299660," all right"
4299660,4301660," um"
4301660,4303660," um"
4303660,4310620," how do you reload the background color"
4310620,4319180," i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know how to answer your question i'm sorry i don't"
4319180,4329180," understand um i just reload it so could you could you please be more specific what exactly do you think"
4329180,4335980," is difficult about reloading the background right because like what exactly do you want to know like"
4335980,4338540," i just reload it"
4338540,4344940," just like it's it's not a good like i don't know how to answer your question"
4344940,4348620," like i want to answer don't get me wrong i really want to answer your question"
4348620,4352140," but this question is just not good like what exactly do you want to want i"
4352780,4357660," just wrote the code that reloads the background when you modify the file what exactly do you want"
4357660,4363580," to know i'm really sorry like every time somebody asks a question like that i feel like i'm forced"
4363580,4366140," to be an that just says these horrible things"
4368700,4374060," sorry like i'm i'm just i'm sorry i just don't know how to answer it"
4374060,4382860," uh hello fengchi welcome welcome to the stream how are you doing um all right so we managed to get"
4382860,4385260," you know reloading done"
4385260,4389740," managed to get the reloading done and"
4396220,4397180," two five two"
4397180,4402140," introduce"
4402140,4422140," reduce reloading by f6 key let's push that right into the repo"
4425500,4431580," wow"
4431580,4438780," so let's actually try to slowly um start working on different things as well"
4438780,4454460," so for example i think we also don't have a proper support for sounds"
4455500,4458380," uh so let's enable the sounds"
4458380,4467420," and see if the sounds will get corrupted right so because i think they got corrupted"
4467420,4470540," so and now if i try to reload that"
4473340,4475500," yeah they got corrupted nice"
4475500,4491100," and this is probably because uh we need the sound indices instead of uh sound um yeah instead of uh"
4491100,4498060," sound samples that's right so um yeah i'm not really sure how good of an idea that would be but"
4498060,4504620," we can try for now at least right we can try for now so essentially uh when you're querying the texture"
4504620,4508540," right when you're querying the texture you get a texture index"
4508540,4512940," uh but then if you acquire the sound you get the sample"
4514300,4522140," uh so what if we actually have uh sample index instead instead of this thing um so yeah let's"
4522140,4526700," introduce that so where is the texture index just defined uh let's go to sound"
4526700,4532380," to be fair i want to do a texture index thing you hear"
4532380,4536620," here struct right let's actually move it here somewhere"
4536620,4544460," and it's going to be in the assets because the texture index is related to the assets"
4544460,4546700," so and i think uh"
4546700,4550220," it makes sense to actually keep it here"
4550220,4558380," okay so it doesn't really compile properly let's let's see what we have here"
4558380,4564220," so that means i'll have to include the uh something assets hpp here"
4564220,4569020," and let's go"
4569020,4577660," okay so what else here uh did i make some changes that actually screwed everything up"
4577660,4583020," uh frame animat is not declared here okay so where's the frame animat is defined struct"
4583820,4591420," frame animat so it's defined in a sprite uh something sprite hpp"
4591420,4597020," okay"
4597020,4602940," frame animat was not declared this so weird"
4602940,4610220," so weird so why why i cannot have that here's the frame animat"
4611100,4613580," and i'm just loading that thing there"
4613580,4622940," um is it because of something some sort of like a circular dependencies it could be because of that"
4622940,4625020," um"
4625020,4630460," i'm confused actually"
4630460,4638620," was not declared in the scope template argument one is invalid was not declared in the scope template one"
4638620,4645980," agreement is when is invalid this is not helpful this is the most unhelpful what"
4645980,4648700," i"
4648700,4651020," oh my god"
4651020,4654380," c plus plus is so fucking toxic oh my god"
4654380,4659260," uh oh because yeah it's literally because i have a circle dependency okay"
4659260,4662140," yeah all right"
4663580,4669980," it's literally because of the circle dependencies it it it can't even give me the proper error message"
4669980,4671020," because of that okay"
4671020,4676700," uh it can't even give me the proper error message"
4676700,4683420," all right and uh something is completely broken because yeah okay"
4692460,4699420," what the hell is going on so here's the sprite and the sprite maybe i also have to remove this thing then"
4699420,4701180," um"
4701180,4704940," so weird man"
4704940,4709740," so fucking weird man okay"
4709740,4711500," uh"
4712780,4715020," yeah yeah it seems to be working now"
4715020,4716380," so"
4716380,4720460," but what i need to do now is to go to the sound"
4720460,4722860," uh where is the sound stuff"
4722860,4725820," um"
4725820,4727900," struct"
4727900,4731820," sample s16"
4731820,4733420," uh index"
4733420,4736860," right and it's going to be something like this"
4737420,4739500," so it's going to be size t unwrap"
4739500,4741340," right size t unwrap"
4741340,4747980," uh texture index and i think i have to inherit texture index for some additional stuff"
4747980,4749100," so"
4749100,4753020," i think it has something like index"
4753020,4755020," yeah public index"
4755020,4760140," yeah i'm using here i'm using inheritance by the way in c plus plus just just so you know"
4761100,4762140," just for your information"
4762140,4763580," uh"
4763580,4765580," so sound"
4765580,4768780," and i can do things like this now"
4768780,4769900," sunshine"
4769900,4778940," it is convenient actually right"
4778940,4780140," um"
4780140,4784940," index entity index is not available god damn it"
4785580,4786540," uh"
4786540,4786780," fuck"
4786780,4791500," when they inherit the skin here kicks in"
4791500,4806300," you're definitely a bad person thank you so much i really appreciate your comments"
4806300,4815340," imagine being called like a bad person based on the technical decisions you make for your"
4815340,4816060," pet projects"
4816060,4819420," that you do for recreational purposes"
4819420,4829580," thank you thank you so much really appreciate that super cool this is exactly why i share my uh"
4829580,4834060," you know the development of my pet projects uh on the internet so i can hear this kind of comments"
4834060,4839420," it's really you know refreshing makes me feel alive so uh"
4843420,4846540," i think i need to um create"
4846540,4848540," uh"
4848540,4851820," a separate thing where i'm gonna keep all of the indices and stuff because"
4851820,4864140," uh i keep reusing them in different places and stuff like that"
4864140,4872860," i think i'm gonna do the following thing where you have different types and stuff"
4872860,4879580," and where do i have a sample struct"
4879580,4881980," and where do i have a sample struct"
4881980,4892700," and where do i have a sample struct"
4892700,4895740," and where do i have a sample struct"
4895740,4897900," and where do i have a sample struct"
4897900,4913820," so this is not going to be entity index it's going to be sample 16 index"
4923820,4927340," okay let's let's let's uh go through the compilation areas as usual"
4927340,4933980," let's follow the compilation areas i gotta say so i suppose the thing we're gonna do is just include"
4936060,4938700," something index"
4938700,4947580," okay that actually worked better than i expected okay"
4947580,4949180," uh"
4949180,4955180," so yeah essentially this is going to be a centralized place where we keep all of these things here"
4956300,4970860," um sure how much of a good idea that is but yeah let's let's just keep it there"
4973020,4978700," so here's the index and here we're also going to use index"
4978700,4986700," uh so it may take quite some time i suppose to properly yeah there you go"
4986700,4994780," um we'll have to do another round of refactoring because now we have to replace all of that in all of"
4994780,4999580," these places nice uh yeah"
4999580,5004380," it's kind of"
5004380,5007500," it's kind of interesting"
5007500,5013340," all right let's let's actually go ahead and try to replace all of that and see how it goes"
5013340,5020780," so the the entities like the not the entity but the uh asset system needed the uh needed some"
5021420,5033020," uh refactoring long time ago uh sp is a user uh user defined literals that's what they are um"
5033020,5046620," so here's the sample and here instead of like actual samples we're gonna store indices right so and"
5046620,5052380," hopefully that will make this kind of thing better hopefully i'm not sure if it will but"
5052380,5059260," we'll see how it goes all right so here is another and when you are playing a sample right"
5059260,5069420," jump samples we have a mixer that plays samples okay so here's the thing uh we take jump samples"
5069420,5080780," and jump samples actually define an index inside of the assets so assets uh sounds uh so let me actually"
5080780,5085260," find them assets um sounds"
5085260,5094700," sounds uh huh and like that and then we're gonna unravel all of that stuff we're gonna simply"
5094700,5097020," unwrap all of that and um"
5097020,5108220," so here's another one so here's the item so you can assign a sound to an item i suppose this is the"
5108220,5115180," sound that is played when you pick it up which is why do we assign separate sounds for separate items"
5115180,5121180," it doesn't make any sense i don't i think it's overkill like we can just play the same sound every"
5121180,5128300," time you pick up item like there's no reason to to assign it to each individual eye like kind of item"
5128300,5141420," there is no reason to play different sounds when you pick up different items it's just so silly"
5142540,5149020," all right doesn't make any sense"
5149020,5156700," is the stream lagging oh yeah we actually dropped uh like a couple of a couple of frames i'm really"
5156700,5163580," sorry about that so maybe it's a russian internet actually so um yeah no it's it's my internet i'm sorry"
5165100,5168540," what's up welcome welcome to the stream welcome welcome how are you doing"
5168540,5179660," so and again i i forgot the the reason why i actually went there"
5179660,5185900," i forgot the reason why i actually went there so i went there to replace this thing with an index"
5190780,5197660," um all right and when i play this into i think i want to unwrap that and use that as an index for"
5197660,5204140," the assets in the sounds right the assets in the sounds and then i can grab that and that can be"
5204140,5210460," that's going to be the actual sound here um and still reloading the sounds is going to be kind of"
5213020,5217180," weird because there could be currently playing sounds"
5217180,5223100," yes um"
5223100,5230220," two different items in here from that item's truck or they're just instances of that truck"
5230220,5232860," they're instances of that truck yes uh they are"
5234540,5245900," um all right they are just instances okay so in the mixer uh i think we can make a method struct uh"
5245900,5252300," what is the method by the way i mean mixer i think it's somewhere in the sound right"
5257100,5261260," i think we need a method that cleans everything that is currently playing"
5261260,5271500," uh right because how do we play things in the mixer right now so it's a sound uh play sample"
5271500,5277980," uh right so we're playing the sample we're assigning that sample here"
5279740,5287980," uh-huh so there's an audio cursor there's an audio cursor and if it's bigger or equal to the audio"
5287980,5296860," length if it's equal to audio length we are essentially uh considering that to be a free slot"
5296860,5303020," so i think the easiest way here would be to just iterate through all of the things all of the"
5303020,5313340," plain samples right now right um something like it says ti sample mixer capacity right sample mixer"
5313340,5318940," capacity and for each individual sample uh we're gonna actually clean it up we're gonna assign like"
5318940,5320060," an empty thing there"
5320060,5328380," what's up from the sun drift welcome to the stream"
5333020,5339660," all right all right um so assets"
5339660,5349900," so it doesn't have to be like that it only has to be like this"
5349900,5353980," all right"
5357980,5371100," assets sounds"
5371100,5376940," people are hard coding gcc in make files"
5376940,5385820," oh yeah people do be like that sometimes i mean usually people do that because then they don't know"
5385820,5391020," any better right because i've been doing that for quite some time as well uh right"
5391020,5400460," until i realize that it makes the uh software more portable if you sort of like let the people"
5400460,5405420," customize the computer but yeah a lot of people actually don't know that it's kind of interesting"
5405420,5408620," so"
5411660,5417900," because uh some people don't even use linux that actively right they usually may be coming"
5417900,5423340," from the windows environment and they heard that on linux you're supposed to use gcc"
5423340,5429660," so they just use gcc and yeah without considering freebsd or anything like that so"
5429660,5436860," yeah it do be like that sometimes need to be like that sometimes"
5436860,5446460," okay okay this one is interesting"
5446460,5456060," do i really wanna okay so uh players should sound do i even use that"
5458380,5462460," uh i literally don't use that anywhere so i'm gonna remove that for now"
5462460,5470460," uh so this thing does not exist"
5470460,5481900," all right so what about entity jump sample i think we don't need that uh either anymore yeah it's it's"
5481900,5488940," literally not used so i can remove it as well hopefully by the end of this refactoring we'll"
5488940,5495820," be able to remove a lot of stuff did you touch orcs engine i haven't touched any engine unfortunately"
5495820,5500620," what do you think about it's data driven approach i don't know anything about data driven approach i'm"
5500620,5505740," sorry the only thing i know about it it exists but i don't know anything about it i'm sorry i'm not"
5505740,5512700," a game developer so um i'm not the right person to ask this kind of questions what i do i just do things"
5512700,5515500," um yeah sorry"
5515500,5525100," so my opinion kind of doesn't matter in this industry because i'm not part of this industry very sorry"
5529660,5532300," all right all right so i think this thing is also not needed"
5532300,5542620," uh damage enemy so i think yeah it depends on what is damage enemy so it's it could be an"
5542620,5552220," off sound essentially what we need to do here is assets get sound by id or panic and we're going to"
5552220,5558140," do oof sound all right i'm going to do an oof sound so it's going to be sv"
5558140,5561020," oof sound"
5561020,5570380," unwrap and all right this one is actually super complicated well i'm not sure why i'm doing it"
5570380,5576540," like that but it's probably for the best for now hopefully then later we're going to refactor that"
5578780,5585660," so i feel always a little bit better when i need to write like temporarily crappy code um but yeah"
5585660,5589500," it is needed sometimes um"
5589500,5595820," and luckily it is temporarily"
5595820,5608220," i feel everyone just regard you i don't know this word i'm sorry this is too sophisticated word for me"
5608220,5613340," the data driven everything is the holy grail of game dev i think this is like a much deeper"
5613340,5620860," fundamental problem with the industry it's like people in any area of this industry people just pick"
5620860,5629100," up one thing and uh just praise it as the silver bullet and of course they don't call it silver bullet"
5629100,5634300," because frederick brooks uh said that silver bullet does not exist so they just don't call it like that but"
5634300,5642620," they still act like this is a silver bullet until they realize that it's not so it's kind of funny"
5642620,5650300," you know the famous article frederick brooks wrote right the famous articles silver bullet does not exist"
5650300,5658300," so what he meant with this article is that silver bullet does not exist what people understood from"
5658300,5661660," that article is that you're not allowed to call it silver bullet"
5661660,5669580," so yeah people want silver bullet and they act like it exists"
5669580,5675900," but they know they're not allowed to call it silver bullet so they don't but they still act like it's a silver bullet"
5676780,5686620," um so yeah and essentially these kind of things it pollutes the entire industry like everywhere um"
5687900,5701500," and again just because you don't call it a silver bullet that doesn't mean that you think you don't think it's a silver bullet"
5705500,5713180," but presumably he's paraphrasing bold reloads there was no gulf war i have no idea what it is i'm sorry"
5713180,5722460," i'm not educated enough to understand this references i'm really sorry about that i'm just stupid and educated russian"
5725500,5733580," all right so we don't have this thing let's continue um okay so we also have this thing"
5733580,5742140," and we do play it right and uh it's um it's this stuff"
5742140,5753100," kill enemy something something and when i play this sound what i want to do here is just unwrap this thing"
5753100,5756540," and then we're gonna do assets sounds"
5756540,5766620," so i can remove that hopefully"
5766620,5776540," assets get okay so here i'm i'm supposed to return id uh right"
5783100,5793660," and here i'm supposed to return index and uh everything should be okay now"
5793660,5808940," um all right so seems to be okie dokie karaoke and quite important thing uh when we are reloading by"
5808940,5815820," by pressing f6 right where's the f6 before trying to reload anything right what we have to do we have"
5815820,5823420," to take the mixer and clean it right because the mixer might be uh playing some sounds and if we try"
5823420,5829100," to reload the sounds they're going to be referring to uh to old ones and i think it's it's quite important to"
5829100,5837500," maybe put a note here it is important important to uh clean"
5837500,5848540," all of the samples from the mixer before reloading uh the assets before reloading the assets"
5849900,5863980," because after assets assets are reloaded uh any pointers pointers stored in the mixer uh could be"
5863980,5873420," invalidated invalidated right so yeah something like this um so i think it's it's important to put this"
5873420,5878540," note here just in case somebody's gonna you know look into that and try to understand why the"
5878540,5884860," fuck we're doing that here well we're doing that because it can be invalidated all right so uh let me"
5884860,5891180," see what's gonna happen let me see what's gonna happen and i'm gonna run this thing so we can hear"
5891180,5898540," sounds we can hear sounds i can reload everything and sounds are still playing even after reloading everything"
5899660,5905340," so let me double check if we're not if we actually reload the sounds uh if we actually reload the"
5905340,5910940," sounds okay so we're actually reloading everything we will load both textures and the sounds which is"
5910940,5920620," quite amazing i really like that uh okay so um the only thing that is currently not working is reloading"
5920620,5927740," animations right so because inside of the animations it also can uh reinvalidate some some pretty important"
5927740,5935260," stuff uh permission denied that was weird oh this is probably because it was in the middle of recompiling"
5935260,5944460," this entire stuff i see i see it was in the middle of doing that um all right so and i can try to uh in"
5944460,5950860," the runtime right so we do pew pew pew right this is a pew pew sound and then i can go to the assets"
5950860,5959740," hopefully uh go to the assets and the pew sound right where's the pew sound uh here's the pew sound um"
5959740,5968300," i can command it out and maybe assign an oof sound instead right just to see if the dynamic reloading of"
5968300,5980220," the assets actually works so and it does so yeah um we can reload it one more time and there you go so you can"
5980220,5987740," basically basically hot reload the assets uh like sounds now uh and also textures and everything"
5987740,5991580," it's actually pretty pretty cool i really like how it's coming together"
5991580,5998060," i really like how it's coming together so let's let's do a committee committee that required like a very"
5998060,6004460," extensive refactoring but i hope it was worth it um and i hope it in the future i'm gonna make the"
6005340,6013740," the code a little bit better i hope it will be able to do that um all right so let's let's commit everything"
6013740,6025500," uh fix uh hot reloading the sounds fix what reloading the sounds"
6031660,6038380," okay so uh i want to go uh make some some small break i probably need to refill my water also i"
6038380,6043980," want to grab a little bit of chocolate and uh yeah after like a three minutes break we're gonna continue"
6043980,6050460," uh with our development and hopefully we'll be able to hot reload animations i think hot reloading"
6050460,6059660," animations would enable pretty cool you know workflows because yeah you can basically sort of design an"
6059660,6067100," animation while the game is running which is super convenient um and i also have an interesting"
6067100,6076060," thoughts about maybe making separate tool for editing animations um for the game basically that tool"
6076060,6083500," will help you to specify the size of the frame the amount of frames how they lay out it in the in a"
6083500,6088460," sprite sheet and then it will automatically export that into the animation file"
6088460,6096220," and then uh you'll be able to hot reload this animation at um at runtime just to quickly check and"
6096220,6102380," see if everything's working i think yeah i really like where how it's coming together it's actually super cool"
6102380,6103420," it's actually super cool"
6105260,6115340," all right so uh let's make a small break boys and girls and have fun have fun"
6115340,6119340," this is not what i wanted to run jesus christ i'm so dumb"
6119340,6130380," i'm so sorry okay so i actually went to a wrong folder i'm sorry this is what i want to run have fun"
6130380,6143820," so"

6278220,6278220," you"
6278220,6278220," so"
6278220,6278220," you"
6278220,6278220," so"
6278220,6291660," i'm"
6291660,6291660," so"
6291660,6294460," i'll write them back how is everyone doing"
6294460,6300700," so i got the cube of chocolate"
6300700,6303980," um"
6303980,6308540," oh what's up archulis welcome to the stream how are you doing i'm just eating chocolate chocolate"
6308540,6313260," nothing special um yeah it's a chocolate eating stream now"
6313260,6321100," welcome welcome welcome um oh yeah"
6321100,6328620," we're working right now on um i shouldn't be talking actually right now"
6330460,6334780," we're working on the asset reloading system"
6334780,6341820," which is pretty cool it enables you with uh changing the assets i suppose that's a pretty good"
6341820,6343820," way to put it"
6343820,6348460," let me assume"
6354140,6354940," yeah"
6354940,6357740," yeah so essentially i think the one of the demo that i already showed"
6357740,6361660," is using a separate to modify some of the things"
6361660,6363260," and how to reload them"
6363260,6369420," so essentially we can have these sprites there do that look in a particular way"
6369420,6371020," and then"
6371020,6375660," we can go ahead and modify something in them"
6376860,6383980," like this"
6383980,6384780," like this and save that and automatically reload it here so well that's what we're working on right now"
6384780,6388220," it already works for the textures"
6388220,6395100," and we recently just made it work for for the for the sound"
6396460,6411820," and um i'm working on making it work for animations as well"
6411820,6417580," okay so that's actually kind of interesting"
6418780,6423260," it stayed so then i can discard the um the changes here"
6423260,6426540," and yeah then they they got discarded properly"
6426540,6428860," all right that's cool"
6434300,6440940," did i make my own engine well yes and but that wasn't as difficult as many people may think"
6440940,6446460," because i didn't make a sophisticated engine i make a super simple engine"
6446460,6452060," and making a simple engine is relatively easy i would say"
6452060,6458380," it is relatively easy"
6461340,6474860," so what what do we need here um i think we need the support for the um for the animations um assets"
6474860,6477660," hpp"
6477660,6481500," is it cpp"
6481500,6489660," okay just a second need to check something"
6491340,6494780," just need to check something super quick"
6494780,6500620," excuse me"
6500620,6516620," all right so now if i uncomment this thing for the for the animations it's not going to work"
6516620,6520620," right it's definitely not going to work"
6521340,6522940," um"
6522940,6529100," are spars going to be animated also like glowing shining eyes block we'll see about that um i'm"
6529100,6534780," going to think about that when i'm going to try to make the the game pretty right so right now i'm"
6534780,6539020," in the face of just making the game and you know game mechanics and stuff like that"
6539020,6543100," once i'm okay with the game mechanics and everything"
6543900,6549340," i'll try to polish i'll try to polish the game and make it look a little bit better and then i'll start"
6549340,6550780," thinking about these kind of effects"
6550780,6558540," um streamer can you show us your desk setup uh well i showed it actually multiple times"
6559580,6566220," so it's just a laptop and that's it and just keyboard and mouse attached to it nothing nothing special"
6566220,6571260," actually nothing special um all right so let's actually work"
6574060,6580060," what is your work and break time technique uh when i'm motivated at work when i'm tired i make a break"
6580620,6582220," it's actually pretty simple technique"
6582220,6586940," all right"
6586940,6596700," so uh let me take a look so i think now uh i'm gonna do this kind of thing i just reloaded"
6596700,6603660," everything and as you can see everything has disappeared everything has disappeared pomodoro"
6603660,6611260," i tried pomodoro once to be fair well actually not once three times i tried three times it didn't"
6611260,6617020," work for me i suppose it's one of those things that it works for somebody but it doesn't work for other"
6617020,6623260," people and it definitely didn't work for me um i don't know um it's kind of difficult for me"
6623820,6629660," i i think i kind of know why it didn't work for me because uh in pomodoro you have to force to focus"
6629660,6635820," yourself on something and i cannot do that if i don't like it i cannot force myself to focus on"
6635820,6640380," something even for 20 minutes or for 10 minutes or for five minutes if i don't like doing that"
6640380,6645260," that caused so much trouble throughout my entire life oh my god"
6649100,6655020," my life would have been completely different if i could just focus for five minutes on something that"
6655020,6659660," i don't like i would have been in a different place in life but unfortunately"
6659660,6671020," luckily like i got really lucky um my brain is capable of focusing on things that actually"
6671020,6678540," you know get me a job and made me capable of sustaining myself i could have been actually"
6678540,6686220," less lucky imagine if i yeah yeah i could like i'm i'm actually super lucky that my brain even though"
6686220,6694140," it's up it's still capable on focusing on things that can still help me sustain myself like i'm so happy"
6696620,6702060," anyway whatever i don't know why i keep talking about that did you participate in game jam no i"
6702060,6710140," never participated in game jams um because i'm not a game developer i'm sorry um um"
6710140,6717100," i participated in competitive programming so it's kind of like a game jams for not game developers"
6718620,6730060," i guess that's the best way to uh to put it right anyway um so yeah we need to um finish the animat assets"
6730060,6743500," and stuff um for me i'll spend that time instead of trying to focus i'll just complain wine in my head"
6743500,6754460," so yes um what industry do you work on entertainment i suppose"
6754460,6757740," yeah"
6757740,6760780," um"
6760780,6765020," all right"
6765020,6769020," okay"
6773500,6783180," so if i try to reload it now it okay disappears and if we take a look at the frame on your mat"
6783180,6789820," it's trapped no i don't remember how to do that frame on your mat"
6789820,6795980," okay um so what's the problem here"
6800860,6805820," we can try to solve that similarly i think we can try to solve that similarly by actually"
6805820,6813740," uh thinking in terms of uh indices instead of uh pointers yes i think it's actually pretty cool idea"
6813740,6821020," so i'm gonna go to the indices right it's gonna be index uh and uh struct um"
6822940,6827020," i'm gonna go frame on my mat index it's gonna be public"
6827020,6835660," and i know that i'm a bad person for like for using inheritance in this christian procedural stream"
6835660,6844860," right but this is actually super convenient to be fair because i need uh like equivalent of new type"
6844860,6850620," but in c right so this is essentially what you know if you program in haskell you probably know what"
6850620,6856780," i'm talking about so essentially i want to have a wrapper around integer but at the same time i don't"
6856780,6861580," want to end up in implementing a lot of boilerplate like additional boilerplate for each individual index"
6861580,6866700," like comparison and maybe some arithmetic operations in the future i don't know uh what i'm going to use"
6866700,6873180," there so that's why i'm using inheritance and i forgot how it's called when you have a type"
6873820,6878300," and you inherit from another type that uses the original type as a parameter you see i'm using the"
6878300,6883900," parameter uh for for for my parent here does anybody remember how this technique is called i keep"
6883900,6891020," forgetting it it has a name it has a very fancy name and if you say that in a in a circle of uh computer"
6891020,6896140," scientists that everyone is is going to automatically respect you for for knowing that for knowing that name"
6896140,6901580," what's the name because i keep forgetting it that's why no nobody respects me because i keep forgetting"
6901580,6909580," yeah crtp yes thank you thank you so much melg1 you are respectable person um in cs community apparently"
6909580,6914780," because you remember all these names and every time people bring them up you can just throw these names"
6914780,6924460," and everyone wow he knows his his all right um thank you so much yeah so it's called crtp uh and it's"
6924460,6930860," actually super convenient in this particular situation it's super convenient because yeah i can"
6930860,6936300," just define the new index and it acts like a like an integer but at the same time it is not an integer so"
6936860,6944220," yeah it's a curious curious curiously recurring template patterns that's what they are and i cannot remember"
6944220,6957260," that name unfortunately cannot remember that name um so yeah um all right so uh okay i'm gonna introduce"
6957260,6964940," another index and i'm gonna go to the assets uh and let's just do that let's just do that"
6964940,6975660," so here's the index index uh and let's go through the compilation errors and just see what's what's there"
6976380,6984780," let's just let's just let's just do that um all right so here's the anima do i even i think i do use that"
6987500,6991820," so in entities uh entity hpp"
6991820,7000700," uh so we have frame anima let's actually use frame anima indices and i have a feeling that"
7000700,7006780," it's going to be a lot of refactoring that we'll see how it goes we'll see how it goes let's just go"
7006780,7007500," ahead and do that"
7012140,7014460," but what's harder c sharp or java"
7014460,7023420," i don't know how do you measure hardness so give us the criteria of how to measure hardness over programming language"
7023420,7028380," and after we have the criteria we can you know compare the hardness of these two things"
7028380,7034540," so i think that's the best way to answer what is harder c sharp or java right just come up with"
7034540,7040220," the criteria of hardness and just compare it but the problem is that this this criteria has to be"
7040220,7045900," actually measurable right so uh at the uh after we apply the criteria we should end up with the number"
7045900,7054140," so for example c sharp is uh six point hardness and java is for example you know 69 points of hardness right"
7054140,7060060," so you come up with a criteria i don't know any criteria"
7060060,7067100," all right"
7070220,7081340," so when we're rendering this thing what we're doing here what the is going on"
7081340,7091420," so the idol is an index i see so essentially what we have to do here is we have to unwrap this entire thing"
7092380,7104140," and then assets um then um and then we'll have to unwrap it again uh i'm not sure if it makes sense for me to keep"
7104140,7111900," tracking paths and stuff yeah like i really apologize for this super ugly quote uh i plan to"
7111900,7118860," change that in the future in the future it's going to be actually way better hopefully um we'll see how it goes"
7120060,7126060," so i i'm writing this kind of stuff just for now to make it working and once it's working i can i will"
7126060,7133100," be able to incrementally improve it hopefully um so assets it's actually any mods"
7140620,7146780," all right all right all right so and and i forgot to to unwrap this thing"
7146780,7152940," all right unwrap"
7152940,7159580," okay uh assets uh animate"
7165020,7168540," with which i today with which i today i'm finally going to cook something for lunch myself instead"
7168540,7170780," of eating takeaway food what are you planning to cook"
7170780,7181580," and congrats it's actually super cool"
7188300,7191260," all right all right all right so let me let me see"
7191260,7194780," yes it's any mods"
7194780,7202700," uh chickpea burger with baked potatoes and veggies oh my god that sounds amazing"
7202700,7206780," chickpea bird what is chickpea i don't even know"
7206780,7212380," i mean like chicken and peas right or is it"
7215420,7220140," oh okay okay so it's a it's a i'm sorry like i don't really speak english that well"
7220140,7223340," that sounds interesting"
7223340,7232540," nice you can make burgers out of it so basically you can make a flower and then dough is that is that what"
7232540,7233820," it is huh"
7238700,7241420," interesting so it's basically replacement for wheat"
7241420,7246060," yeah i see cool never tried that"
7246060,7254220," well bon appetit it's the chickens that hatched from peas i see"
7254220,7261180," falafel is made out of chickpea i don't know what is a falafel oh my god"
7263180,7268780," i'm so sorry like i'm coming from like a different part of the world where we have like completely"
7268780,7273820," different crops and things and all of these things are completely new for me and i'm so sorry for not"
7273820,7274700," knowing all of that"
7274700,7279980," yeah although that sounds actually very interesting um"
7285260,7288620," um all right so assets"
7288620,7293580," i usually cook rice"
7293580,7303740," yeah what i usually cook is a very simple food surprisingly it's usually super simple i'm not"
7303740,7309580," trying to do anything sophisticated by the way are you gonna make buns yourself like out of the"
7310220,7313340," chickpea with flour and stuff like that it's actually super cool"
7313340,7322620," um like i was wanting to make it like a burger and also make my own buns but it always looked super"
7322620,7328860," super sophisticated for me uh uh falafel is just a kind of shawarma by the way it's quite popular"
7328860,7331900," here in ukraine oh that's interesting okay"
7334540,7345100," yeah um all right so here's the assets and then we're gonna have any mods uh unwrap uh-huh and there we go"
7345100,7349740," um"
7349740,7358140," assets and mats"
7362140,7369100," um"
7369100,7385820," so here's the game entity working anyway i'm not sure if we need these things i think we'll have to"
7385820,7390940," remove them as well at some point yes this is another case of the things that are not needed anymore"
7392620,7403660," this is in yet another case of the case of that"
7403660,7408700," okay so then we have a toolbar"
7408700,7415820," uh-huh okay i see so we can remove that i think"
7415820,7430380," uh okay"
7430380,7440540," uh-huh so it's needed for projectiles but in the in case of projectiles we can actually get them from the"
7440540,7455100," assets themselves when they spawn them so i don't think it's that"
7457100,7479660," uh just a second one another another piece of chocolate"
7479660,7490380," i'm so sorry i just just can't help myself"
7490380,7491580," um"
7491580,7495740," i'm getting some coffee okay enjoy your coffee"
7497100,7512620," probably i heard you can get addicted to chocolate i suppose i am addicted to chocolate now"
7512620,7525100," i'm going to get addicted to chocolate but i don't know if it's too loud and gross and i'm going to mute myself while i'm meeting"
7525100,7538620," so"
7538620,7553260," i'm going to get a new mod"
7555100,7569660," um"
7569660,7577420," i'm going to get the idea and unwrap it then in assets i should be able to"
7578540,7580620," and that's like that"
7580620,7589180," wait a second i don't need to do that i have to just do it like that yeah so i don't need to unwrap"
7589180,7595420," so let's find projectiles"
7595420,7603820," yeah this one has to be index"
7603820,7613020," this chocolate tastes like shit by the way"
7614860,7626060," because it's it's it's literally uh 97 97 7 chocolate it's horrible but i like the feeling after it"
7626060,7630620," it makes me feel a little bit better"
7630620,7634460," all right"
7639100,7644220," get better chocolate well i mean isn't any concentrated chocolate is going to be like that"
7644220,7646540," they're usually very bitter"
7646540,7649580," is it really chocolate though"
7649580,7651420," it's fucking horrible"
7651420,7656380," well what can i say i'm programming in c++ i'm a masochist"
7656380,7665020," i don't know at least that's what i heard i don't consider myself a masochist for"
7665020,7668780," programming in c++ but some people said in the chat that i'm a masochist for"
7668780,7674780," up to do that what did you say about c++ i didn't say anything i just quoted some person in the chat"
7674780,7679100," somebody yesterday said why i am i touching myself with c++"
7679100,7683340," i personally have nothing against c++ to be fair"
7683340,7694220," why that high cocoa percent um because it's"
7696300,7701740," how to say that it makes a stronger dopamine kick that's why"
7701740,7710620," the the chocolate with the less uh content of cocoa actually doesn't give me that much of a"
7710620,7719020," dopamine kick as the 97.7 i'm trying to find like at least like 99 or 100 but i couldn't find only 97"
7723980,7728780," all right so we have a new mod and what we're trying to do here we are trying to reset it so"
7728780,7731020," i'm going to wrap this thing"
7736140,7751580," assets and mods and wrap um all right active animate"
7759100,7766220," it's correct projectile active animate okay i see so here essentially i have to do"
7766220,7770700," does it exist in the assets"
7770700,7775980," active animate"
7779340,7795580," all right okay so now we're gonna do it like that let's recompile that we're almost there hopefully"
7795580,7802620," so and when we're right okay this one is interesting so now we're rendering things"
7808940,7817340," are you guys like i guess arguing about how to correctly spell a thing in a cyrillic i mean"
7817340,7821820," russian and bulgarian are literally different languages are they not or ukrainian i don't know"
7821820,7827180," is the spelling in ukrainian the same as in russian i don't know maybe"
7831500,7847580," so uh assets and not"
7847580,7857500," guys are naturally competitive it's the only reason we're not living in caves and mud huts cool not a guy"
7857500,7873820," then thank you so much oh all right because i'm the least competitive person actually"
7873820,7874780," um"
7874780,7875180," assets"
7875180,7881020," you gotta be mad you gotta be strong"
7883900,7891020," actually in ukrainian it's also like that you just read it oh okay because yeah the the russian"
7891020,7901340," yeah is basically ukrainian as far as i know i'm sure i don't really know much green"
7911020,7918220," yeah that's right okay cool i know a thing or two about ukrainian apparently cool well my"
7918220,7922780," my babushka is ukrainian so yeah i guess"
7924620,7927260," uh assets assets and nuts"
7927260,7945260," two two two two two two she moved to russia during soviet times i think something related to work"
7945260,7953660," relocation that was quite common in soviet union um so yeah she was relocated to russia and she just"
7953660,7959980," stayed there but she was born in ukraine"
7959980,7965180," moved was moved and it's complicated in soviet union it was complicated"
7965180,7972060," usually after you finish like a higher education you were literally moved to different places where you"
7972060,7978860," and your qualifications was needed right and the government paid like everything it paid the trip it"
7978860,7985340," paid the apartment and everything just they say here we have a job for you like there somewhere"
7985340,7989500," and uh we're gonna give you all the resources just go there and work there"
7989500,7995340," so that's how it was in soviet union i think because at least that's what i was told it's not"
7995340,7997900," like that in russia anymore of course but yeah"
7998940,8002700," people uh people uh were constantly relocated within the country where they were needed"
8002700,8009020," um but the minimum yeah of course i mean it's minimum resources yes nobody's gonna give you like a"
8009020,8019980," luxury trip or apartment or anything like that it's a communism um anyway assets and mods uh there we go"
8024380,8030220," so"
8030220,8033180," it's kind of weird oh because i have to do unwrap there we go"
8039820,8046940," and also i think like i heard like a sort of i think on level of conspiracy that also soviet"
8046940,8054220," government were trying to mix up different nations and entities of different republics as much as"
8054220,8061340," possible so it's then more difficult for people to separate right but you know it's it dissolved anyway"
8062140,8067820," so that was just to mix up people as much as possible to create like a universal sort of soviet"
8067820,8072140," nation i suppose but it's just on the level of conspiracies and rumors or something like that"
8072140,8073980," um"
8083260,8089420," all right so what do we have here"
8089420,8094620," is it highly templated c++ code hard to debug"
8094620,8103900," i don't know it just depends on the on the criteria of hardness like give me the criteria of"
8103900,8110540," hardness and i'll tell you whether it's hard or not i don't know how to answer these questions i'm so sorry"
8111340,8113660," um uh yeah"
8113660,8129740," like i literally don't understand what you expect me when you ask is it hard to do x or is x harder than y"
8129740,8138780," i don't know like it's the criteria it's all about criteria man seriously how how do we measure that"
8141340,8169180," so obviously uh the real question the when people ask whether something is hard or is it harder than"
8169180,8177580," than than something than that what they really want to ask uh am i gonna am i gonna spend much much more"
8177580,8183420," effort learning that than that and obviously nobody is like subconsciously don't want to ask"
8183420,8187260," that and word their questions like that because the answer is obvious"
8187260,8190940," well it depends on you i don't know"
8192940,8201820," so yeah so is it going to be hard for you i don't know we can try to reward that question right by"
8201820,8207900," asking so is it usually hard with people with that background to learn that"
8207900,8212700," well and then we can discuss that but you never ask that question i'm sorry"
8213660,8222060," so yeah um"
8222060,8227660," length with bread"
8227660,8241500," it's like if bread was was a number right you can say something like fifth sixth and if bread was a number"
8241500,8242460," or you could say bread"
8242460,8251900," i'm so sorry it's so dumb but"
8251900,8258940," it's the dumbest shit i've ever said"
8261900,8273340," um when you think it's good for use op in c++ when you think it is good for use ops in c++ uh depends on the"
8273340,8282620," definition uh definition of op so what do we understand by op so yeah i don't know this just depends"
8283980,8289420," bread"
8289420,8292780," which time is it for you it's my bread time"
8292780,8297340," all right"
8304780,8310220," so okay so okay get animate by id so framing with frame menu with index okay so um"
8310220,8312940," this thing"
8312940,8318460," we have that and we have that and i think we don't need that anymore"
8325260,8334780," okay you"
8334780,8334780," you"
8355260,8364940," hello welcome back i'm really sorry something something happened with my vpn i think"
8364940,8374620," yeah khb is after me khb is definitely after me so if you uh if the the stream has restored i really"
8374620,8380140," recommend you to refresh the page because if you don't do that you're gonna have a huge uh delay so"
8381500,8383500," um"
8383500,8383740," yeah"
8383740,8388060," all right hello welcome back everyone"
8388060,8391660," uh okay so"
8391660,8396780," we're still compiling things we're still compiling things"
8396780,8405500," um op is great to make the api for system slash subsystem what is a system and what is a subsystem"
8410060,8418220," um"
8418220,8422300," okay so we don't have that anymore"
8422300,8434700," people just throwing just random words that they heard on the internet without trying to understand"
8434700,8437100," what it mean it's just it's just funny"
8437100,8445820," all right so the assets and mods"
8448060,8458060," uh unwrap and just unwrap"
8458060,8459420," um"
8459420,8459580," um"
8459580,8460300," um"
8460300,8463020," game entity uh"
8463020,8466140," wait a second this is kind of interesting"
8466140,8468380," um game entity"
8469980,8473260," and they've removed it right did they remove it okay so entity"
8473260,8477740," idle and mud so that means i'll have to take it from somewhere there"
8479340,8493420," what's going on in the chat is everything okay you guys guys okay"
8493420,8499100," oh okay so you you already all right i i timed out okay"
8502860,8506220," uh uh i would recommend you if you're supposed to actually hard code"
8506220,8511580," the if so if you see a message from mr bodka ignore it uh"
8511580,8518140," zhiak actually did the same thing with his bot so and if you want to have a bot in this channel your"
8518140,8525820," own custom bot here please also add that check all right so i'm okay with uh your custom bots here"
8525820,8535100," only under this particular condition right"
8535100,8539100," um"
8554460,8557500," you killed it for now okay well feel free to bring it back just uh"
8557500,8561580," you know just don't forget to uh you know add a check"
8561580,8569820," don't forget to add that check"
8569820,8575580," so here's the animates and what do we have here so game"
8575580,8578140," oh yeah so uh i need to"
8578140,8582620," uh assets conf"
8583580,8583820," um"
8583820,8588780," uh and let's let's go"
8588780,8599900," um entity enemy i do and you might"
8599900,8604940," um assets get"
8604940,8613340," uh animates by id or panic i suppose"
8613580,8622860," uh"
8622860,8622860," um"
8622860,8630860," so this is in the wrap and do we need to unwrap anything here yeah we'll have to wrap here"
8630860,8640140," um"
8640140,8640140," um"
8640140,8643020," so this is the frames"
8643020,8651260," i'm not quite understand understanding what the fuck is going on to the thing and why did i have to do that"
8653180,8654780," uh wait a second"
8654780,8654780," uh wait a second"
8654780,8662460," uh my brain just stopped working so uh when we have an item and thing"
8662460,8681740," uh yeah i think it's a tool i think it's a tool i think it's a tool i think it's a tool and uh item no it's not it's not the item tool it's a button or something and the icon is just a sprite i see all right uh"
8681740,8691020," uh"
8691020,8700300," uh"
8700300,8700300," uh"
8700300,8700300," uh"
8700300,8700300," uh"
8700300,8700300," uh"
8700300,8700300," uh"
8700300,8700300," uh"
8700300,8700300," uh"
8700300,8700300," uh"
8700300,8700300," uh"
8700300,8709580," uh"
8709580,8713340," so that means oh okay i think my brain i i finally"
8713340,8719580," uh restarted so i should be able to do this thing"
8719580,8728860," uh"
8728860,8744140," so i also have to unwrap this stuff because it's"
8749580,8754860," uh oh okay so uh"
8754860,8758860," let's see this"
8777740,8783180," to be fair like it's kind of pointless to discuss who's a boy or who's a girl"
8783180,8787660," uh if the person tell you told you their preferred pronouns"
8787660,8792220," it would be polite to just use them i suppose"
8792220,8797580," um did we apt i suppose we a little bit we after a little bit i'm sorry"
8797580,8799900," so we should be enough to uh no"
8801980,8813980," um um um"
8813980,8815980," um"
8831980,8844060," i'm really sorry for all of the problems like i don't know i think this time it it is not vpn"
8844060,8845580," i think it's a"
8845580,8847900," um"
8847900,8851020," yeah it's it's something with the twitch"
8851020,8858460," um i'm really sorry like i i don't know i i try everything i try to usually investigate what's the"
8858460,8862700," the problems but i cannot understand what is going on i'm so sorry"
8862700,8866220," uh okay so here i supposed to return this"
8866220,8874620," thing"
8874620,8884060," okay it compiled by the way speaking of speaking of it compiled"
8886460,8888460," um"
8888460,8891260," um should i call on ukgb agent and ask him what he's done"
8891260,8893180," yeah"
8893180,8902940," what are you going to dress up as for halloween uh we do not celebrate halloween here"
8902940,8906300," usually so it would be kind of weird for me to dress up as anything"
8907100,8909740," um so yeah"
8909740,8919980," richard stallman i don't have beard for to be a richard stallman"
8919980,8923180," sorry nothing grows on my face"
8925100,8926140," except my glasses"
8926140,8938940," oh yeah i'm a tom scott today yes exactly yeah thank you thank you so much i wish i could come up with"
8938940,8946300," that joke myself but yeah all right this doesn't work nice cool i'm super happy"
8949340,8950220," projectile"
8950220,8959660," i wanted to add the mechanism for ignoring certain users uh anyways now i have a reason to implement it"
8959660,8961660," no okay sure yeah"
8964780,8968300," i'm glad that i give you the motivation to do that"
8968300,8970700," i'm really glad"
8972300,8983020," your streams are very cool thank you so much"
8983020,8989660," thank you i'm really actually happy to hear that thank you so much"
8990940,9002300," um okay this thing doesn't work let's actually try to investigate where what exactly is going to do"
9002300,9017580," so what's up with that projectile active and why does it even compile that's a good question"
9019100,9024540," uh"
9024540,9031980," uh projectile active any mud right"
9031980,9035820," something the game"
9035820,9038940," ah"
9038940,9047820," because this thing has to be an index why did it work i'm actually kind of curious what the is going on"
9049100,9054060," and this thing should not exist by the way frame any mud projectile active"
9054060,9058460," if i can remove all of that yes let's just remove all of this thing it's not needed"
9069020,9074460," uh so this entire thing does not compile and uh render player hud"
9074460,9080540," what are we doing here"
9080540,9083980," what is this code"
9088380,9097660," what is this code this is so weird"
9097660,9101660," what is this code this is so weird"
9101660,9115980," what is this code this code this code this code this code this code this code this code is"
9115980,9131340," state weapon gun stats ah that's what it okay okay i see what it's what we're doing here i see i"
9131340,9138060," see so essentially we'll have to take the animat and stuff yeah yeah so i think i'm i'm starting"
9138060,9143180," to understand what the hell is going on here it took me way too long to stand what the fuck is"
9143180,9149340," going on and it's not primarily because the code is bad it's just my brain is pepega right now i'm"
9149340,9155980," sorry i'm really sorry about that so projectile active so it's actually projectile uh idle animat"
9155980,9168460," here right it's projectile and i can do assets um i get uh animat id"
9170380,9178060," by id i suppose get animat by id or panic right and then we can do it like this get animated panic"
9178060,9183580," and that gives us the id and i suppose i can just save that to the animat so it's going to be assets"
9183580,9191500," and mats and wrap and uh we can save that to animat like temporarily at least"
9192380,9198700," so in here um i'm gonna replace that with just animat and hopefully that will provide the thing"
9198700,9206220," i'm really glad that i added that assert there adding as many asserts as possible is in fact a"
9206220,9214460," very useful thing to do all the time um right because yeah i added that assert very long time ago"
9215100,9221420," um a very long time ago and i actually didn't think it's going to be that useful but it turned out to be"
9221420,9228140," very useful when i started to refactoring things and that and accidentally invalidated a lot of"
9228140,9233180," assumptions about my code uh i'm trying to ask random question to practice in english"
9234140,9237980," okay so you managed to do that successfully um"
9237980,9245580," i suppose i don't know i don't know to feel free to ask any question i suppose to practice your english"
9252300,9259340," all right seems to be working and if i try to reload things uh nothing is breaking i would say"
9259340,9273900," right and here is the final moment okay can we change the look and feel of enemy in at runtime is"
9273900,9281340," it even possible let's actually find out it's going to be assets.conf and um so okay here is the"
9283180,9289180," enemy animat and what we essentially can do uh we can take this thing and make it like this"
9289180,9293660," right and we're going to command out everything here and i'm going to reload and as you can see"
9293660,9298700," the enemy changed its appearance now the enemy looks like me but what's interesting is that it's"
9298700,9304060," only idle animation that looks like me when it's moving it's going to look like uh the enemy"
9308380,9312860," and all of that is changeable well that was actually kind of funny but all of that is"
9312860,9321340," changeable at runtime so at runtime you can assign this kind of things uh right you can assign this"
9321340,9328620," kind of things um and reload the game and it reloads all of the assets like properly uh allocating"
9328620,9336300," delegating things and that means that they can tweak animations and textures uh without reciting the game"
9336300,9341500," finally so and also maybe tweak sounds and stuff like that this is actually super cool"
9341500,9348060," um and i hope it doesn't leak too much memory but i mean it's 2020 just let it leak and stuff"
9348700,9357260," uh but yeah i think it's coming together quite well i really like how how it works and stuff so it's"
9357260,9362700," actually super cool uh all right so let's actually commit whatever we have and i think we are going"
9362700,9367260," gonna be ready to do a pushy pushy and then maybe commit to commit um"
9367260,9377820," commit to commit okay that's a lot of stupid changes but um yeah i'm really happy with uh with what i came"
9377820,9387100," up with here uh two five two um what was the previous commit wait a second fix hot reloading uh the animates"
9389260,9394060," uh two five two fix hot reloading the animates"
9394060,9409260," all right so hopefully everything is working correctly"
9417420,9421980," okay let's create the pull request i suppose uh i don't think anything else is needed here"
9421980,9426700," let me double check assets just in case uh let me just double check"
9426700,9435260," okay so there's a little bit of garbage that i'd like to remove and stuff and also uh we already"
9435260,9440940," resolved these two to do's on today's stream right so we already did that so let's quickly do it like"
9440940,9461260," that and everything seems to be okie dokie carry okay uh oh my god"
9468940,9486220," clean up comments yeah i think it's a good name clean up comments let's push that right into the replay"
9486220,9492220," let's push that right into the replay so let's create a pull request let's create a pull request"
9492220,9502780," change dirt texture to your face it'd be epic"
9502780,9513740," uh i'm not sure if it's gonna be that easy but we can try because the dirt texture is actually taken"
9513740,9521340," from a sprite sheet not from a single image uh so i'm not sure how easy that would that be"
9521340,9527900," uh but yeah let's actually make a pull request first and then i can think about that"
9527900,9534060," assets reloading by f6 key so it's gonna close"
9535100,9541900," 252 i'm gonna just create a pull request i'm going to add skins and loot boxes"
9541900,9548300," well i wonder how it's gonna work out for an open source game"
9552380,9564140," i don't know maybe uh i'll i'll think about it so uh the way i'm going to organize all of that is i'm"
9564140,9569740," going to upload it to steam right and the code is going to be open by the way so the release is going"
9569740,9575660," to be on steam with opened code so you will be able to install it for free on steam and then if you"
9575660,9582540," want to modify something you can download the code and do things like that uh and if it's if the game"
9582540,9587260," is going to become popular for whatever reason which is quite unlikely maybe i'll think about"
9587260,9595820," different skins but i'm not sure about loot boxes because i'm not approve of gambling and stuff like"
9595820,9602460," that so but different skins could be actually pretty cool because i really want to use 13 guns instead of"
9602460,9609340," certain w well we'll see we'll see i'm not sure about it so the the future of this game is unclear"
9609340,9616380," but for now for now what you can do if you want to use 13 guns instead of 13 w you can go to the"
9616380,9623500," assets and just replace it there so the this price of there is remember where it is yeah certain w"
9623500,9631580," you can just replace this file and uh yeah compile your own version and luckily compiling this game"
9631580,9637820," is easier than compiling as a pride so there should be no problems well i hope it's easier than compiling"
9637820,9643100," a surprise please like i don't have that many third party dependencies the only third party dependencies is"
9643100,9652940," sdl2 and yeah everything is compiled with a single make file so i hope that is easier than uh a surprise"
9652940,9660460," but of course it depends on the criteria what is harder to build something or a surprise i don't know"
9660460,9669340," depends on the criteria anyways so um yeah feel free to do whatever you want with with the game even"
9669340,9676140," replace the skin if you want to uh talking about the surprise so you managed to compile it nice uh"
9676140,9680140," okay let's actually verify that you actually compiled it"
9681900,9685100," okay that is cool congratulations on compiling it"
9685100,9691820," so now you can do a pixel art"
9691820,9702700," all righty all righty all righty so uh do i want to do anything else here i'm not quite sure i'm not quite"
9702700,9712220," sure so uh let's go i think we're ready to merge it i suppose i guess we're ready to merge that"
9712220,9728060," delete the branch delete the branch and uh yep you know what i want to do i want to be able to access"
9728700,9738860," the assets similarly how i access uh the config variables right so look uh we have vars config"
9738860,9745100," right so let me actually find this file varsconv right and in here we define different variables and"
9745100,9750060," you can literally use these variables inside of the code because we use code generation right so we have"
9750060,9754780," a separate tool that reads this entire configuration and generates like these variables for you and that's"
9754780,9760140," that's how you're able to do all of that all right and it's actually super convenient you know what i want to be able to do"
9760140,9770380," uh with the assets right assets uh conf right with the assets conf um i want to be able to use these ids"
9770380,9779260," directly in the source code right so uh instead of doing some i'm not sure where can i wait a second"
9780940,9787500," wait a second how do i access those things then if i cannot find them this is really weird"
9787500,9798140," uh but yeah instead of uh doing this kind of thing where you do assets get animat by id or panic"
9798140,9804780," and uh you know provide like a search for these assets around time we can also like a similarly to the"
9804780,9812860," variable configuration generate these names these macros that will directly pull out those um assets"
9812860,9820780," for you so um yeah but uh it's going to be like a separate issue and uh yeah but right now we're"
9820780,9832540," going to have this kind of thing uh even combining something in windows is easier than a separate yeah"
9832540,9839100," exactly by the way and uh we have a pull request uh that adds windows compilation to this something"
9839100,9845500," um yeah so we're going to actually review that tomorrow because tomorrow is monday and on monday we"
9846060,9852140," go through all of the notification i have and just address them unfortunately this week we"
9852140,9861020," didn't have enough notifications for like a proper stream maybe because hacktoberfest is over so i don't"
9861020,9866460," know why people don't really submit that many pull requests anymore i guess hacktoberfest had something to"
9866460,9872380," do with that um so yeah so we're gonna address these things and maybe for the rest of the tomorrow"
9872380,9877340," stream we're gonna do uh code forces in haskell because why not this is what we did on the last"
9877340,9882300," monday by the way so and sounds like a pretty cool idea by the way hello district campus welcome to the"
9882300,9891340," stream um time to end the stream yes uh sure let me let me just let me just fetch the latest"
9891340,9895100," changes i'm going to finish the stream this is just super quick"
9898220,9905340," all right so what do we have uh merge origin master and um there we go"
9905340,9913580," um how are we doing just your computer by the way is everything okay hello hello"
9913580,9924540," i'm really glad to see you today nice we're doing something epic actually we are um"
9925980,9931820," hot reloading the assets right that's what we're doing so i already did that demo but i'm gonna do"
9931820,9939500," it uh one more time just for you so essentially uh we can do now a very pretty like a very cool thing"
9939500,9949420," um very cool i think so let me actually put some eyes everything is fine uh how is it so how is the"
9949420,9954700," stream going stream is going stream is going well i have a little bit of depression probably due to the fall"
9954700,9967820," but so far it's it's okay so uh i can handle it so um now oh i didn't want to do that uh so"
9972780,9982860," so now you can open the ice right uh you can open the ice and you can modify something here uh you can"
9982860,9990780," modify something here save that and reload in the game uh and it's not gonna work because i"
9990780,9996540," fucked up okay so it's supposed to actually update that live but i think i'm running like a wrong version"
9996540,10004700," i think i'm running old version i'm really sorry about that so the um i think i didn't reload or"
10004700,10010060," something i don't know what exactly happened it's kind of weird let's try it one more time let's try it"
10010060,10020860," one more time uh so oh yeah it's as you can see it actually added this weird thing uh and now like it"
10020860,10028780," has this thing that i added and then if i press ctrl s save everything and uh you know reload it it"
10028780,10036300," automatically reloads everything so uh yeah so essentially this is very important if i want to"
10036300,10043980," design um tiles right and i want to instantly see how they're gonna look like in context so i can modify"
10043980,10050620," things here right just modify these things here uh save it reload it and it's not gonna reset the"
10050620,10056940," state of the game right it's not gonna reset the state of the game and stuff like that um so and it"
10056940,10064700," works for textures it works for sounds it works for animations for everything that we consider an asset"
10064700,10070620," right so uh yeah this this system is going to be actually super useful and this is what i missed"
10070620,10075260," when i was uh you know drawing different tiles for this kind of stuff did you make the background"
10075260,10082220," better no i stole it actually you can find all of the credits for all of the assets that i stole here"
10082220,10090540," there is a credits.org file and um yeah so this is basically everything i stole but all of these assets"
10090540,10096860," by the way they're placeholders right i just put something to have something to test the game so i do"
10096860,10103180," have plans to actually replace all of that with my own assets that i will draw myself and sounds that i"
10103180,10108460," record myself right so yeah that's that's pretty much the plan"
10108460,10114380," um professional software then it's all right everything works"
10119740,10123020," sounds pop well i mean we did record the pop sound"
10123020,10129580," the pop sound that plays when you collect the items"
10129580,10137660," is actually my pop yeah so uh it actually sounds kind of cool i like how it sounds"
10141980,10154540," but yeah so i'm a professional sound designer about that professional sound designer it's pretty cool"
10154540,10163580," it's pretty cool all right so uh let me see let me see so uh reload assets at runtime there we go"
10164220,10169340," so release data pack building based on assets.conf this one is actually very interesting"
10169340,10176780," oh can you try the dirt to face change okay let me actually see how easy it is to do but i"
10176780,10180300," have a feeling that it's not as easy as we may think"
10186860,10190460," yeah at runtime i don't think it's gonna work at runtime that easily"
10190460,10194460," because we don't have um"
10194460,10203740," dirt thingy fantasy tiles yeah essentially the dirt is taken uh"
10203740,10210700," the dirt is taken from a sprite sheet right we can take a look at the sprite sheet"
10211740,10219340," uh fantasy tiles there we go and this is from where we take a dirt and we actually had code how we"
10219340,10228380," take out this entire thing okay so i found a flow in the uh in the asset system thank you thank"
10228380,10234780," you for for asking that so i'll think how we can do that so right now it's not that easy to do unfortunately"
10236460,10244140," um yeah it's not that easy to do beatbox background music for game i mean i can make my own music"
10244140,10249420," basically so i was planning to you know have some sort of like a cheap tune or maybe i don't know"
10249420,10262620," to be fair remember my uh making music in haskell video remember that i want to make music entirely"
10262620,10269500," like programmatically from scratch by generating waves like yeah i want to like i have like a project"
10269500,10275260," that basically generates music for for this thing um so"
10275260,10282060," because uh the problem is that i don't want to use any of the musical software because i don't know"
10282060,10288300," how to use them and i don't want to spend time on learning how to use them i better just write my own software"
10289020,10296620," it's like being programmers programmer is so hard like you don't want to use anyone else software"
10296620,10301260," you just want to write your own software because that way you don't have to learn anything it just"
10301260,10309900," makes it easier like it's kind of weird like it's kind of difficult to explain to non-programmers"
10309900,10314700," especially because they don't like you just learn it like it's it's a long time investment no it's just"
10314700,10332060," easy to learn how to make such things i think i'm weird probably i don't know all right so i'm a little"
10332060,10339260," bit tired already i'm really sorry chat so uh we already streamed for three hours so uh i guess i'm gonna"
10339260,10345900," call today i guess i'm gonna call today today was a relatively good progress i suppose we worked on the"
10345900,10357420," um on the on the asset system right but it's time for me to go thanks everyone who's watching me right"
10357420,10364540," now i really appreciate it have a good one and i see you uh all tomorrow tomorrow according to the schedule"
10364540,10373020," we're gonna have a monday stream a code review stream um and uh on the code review stream we usually go"
10373020,10377740," through the notifications that i receive to my repos but since this week i didn't receive much"
10377740,10382380," notifications i'm not pretty sure what exactly what we're gonna do well we're obviously gonna address"
10382380,10388060," all of these things right uh we're also gonna address all these things but i think after we addressed"
10388060,10392620," all of them i'm gonna just do competitive programming problems as i did uh the last monday because it was"
10392620,10399980," actually kind of fun and doing that in haskell it's makes it makes it super fun because it brings back"
10399980,10406940," brings back so many nostalgia when i was a student and was solving these problems in haskell so yeah i"
10406940,10414220," guess that's what we're gonna do tomorrow um also check out our um schedule check out our schedule for"
10414220,10419900," other things that we're doing and also check out our discord server for the offline discussion with the"
10419900,10425260," community that's that's it for today thanks everyone and see you all tomorrow love you all"
10425260,10436620," love you"
